Mom. Can you hear my voice? I want you to know about my life up until now. Yoichi! Not yet! Look around you! Good! Yoichi, run! I loved basketball when I was little, didn't I? Nothing made me happier than seeing you smile when you cheered me on. They kept cheating by fouling. I wouldn't like it if you won by cheating. Even though you lost, you played better by playing fair. I was so impressed. -Really? -Yes. Like a hero standing up to bad guys. So admirable. Hey, look. A dog. What? Are you embarrassed? Don't hide how you feel. Can I play video games? Sure. You were always like that but you passed away when I was 10. Dad even stopped being a workaholic -and did his best to fill your shoes. -Make sure your lunch box doesn't spill. -Yes. -Take care. -But Dad wanted me to focus -Be careful! on studying, not basketball. He was worried about me. When I got into Hakusui High, regular nationals contenders, he didn't stop me, but he wasn't happy. Don't let me down. I won't. I wanted to impress Dad, so I trained harder than ever. -Toru Honjo. -Here. I made the team in my first year, and all seemed to be going well. But then, in spring of my second year... Don't! Nice! Hey! What's going on? I saw a friend of mine since junior high getting bullied. I couldn't just let it happen. You're scaring Kimizuka! Leave him alone! Are you okay? Oh, I slipped. -From that day on, -Watch where you step. I became their target. You better watch yourself. Hey! Here! -Kono! -Hey! Nice pass! -Nice shot! -Nice! What? I put up with it, until... I'm counting on you, Okada. Yes. No. 12, Toru Honjo. Yes. Kimizuka? Look at you! -Damn, dude! -Are you a mushroom? -You getting this, Kimizuka? -Yes. -I'm getting it. -You're getting this? -It looks great! -Isn't that amazing? That was the moment that broke me. Hey, Yoichi. I made your lunch. What's wrong? Basketball was everything to me, but I began to hate it more and more. I couldn't trust anyone anymore. Dad was the only person I could count on. Principal. I'd like to talk to the students involved in the assault. You're exaggerating it. I don't think I am. It's no wonder bullying won't end if that's how you look at it. Coach Iwata has led our team to success... That's irrelevant, isn't it? If so, let me speak to those boys. Or are you trying to hide something? Are you sure you're not blinded by your loyalty to your son? -What do you mean? -You know our school's status in this prefecture, don't you? Other students' honors are also at stake. We'll take responsibility and investigate this matter thoroughly. Will that satisfy you? Quitting basketball and studying hard will put Dad at ease. This isn't necessarily a bad thing for me or Dad. That's what I told myself. -Dad. -Yes? Can I quit this school? You want to transfer? I'm sorry. It's not you who needs to apologize. I won't do club activities. I'll focus on studying. Okay. And so I transferred to a local school, Tadano High, aka T High. TOCHIGI PREFECTURAL TADANO HIGH SCHOOL YEAR 2 CLASS C From today, you'll have a new classmate. Go on, introduce yourself. Okay. Well... I transferred for family reasons. I'm Yoichi Tadokoro. Nice to meet you. Applause! If you need to talk, I'm here for you. Stop teasing me! Hey, sir. Can we talk? No, we can't. Sit. -But it's serious. -Sit! -That's your desk. -Okay. If he's fallen behind, show him your notes, okay? -Yes, sir. -Okay. Let's get started. Page 54 in your textbooks. Hey. Have you chosen a club yet? No. You're tall. Basketball? We're in the basketball club. We don't have enough members. We need new recruits. No clubs for me. What? What a waste! You should join. -Right? -Yes. What? I think you would fit right in. And girls love basketballers. -Right? -Yes, sure they do. Sorry. I'm not interested. For real? What's wrong? Oh, nothing. Back then, T High's basketball club wasn't anywhere near Hakusui High's level. Welcome, freshman. -I'll teach you handling. -Really? Kyrie Irving's the king of handling, but you know that. I've never heard of him. Not another one. Whatever. Just try to steal the ball. -You won't though. -Okay! -Here we go. -Okay. What? That's odd. OSAMU NEGORO Well, you get the idea. I'm shredded! Check me out! These are just mosquito bites. -Hey, basketballer! -Can you see that? Basketballer! Don't interrupt our practice. Okay. Shouldn't you be practicing seriously too? Hey! Hey, Shunsuke! Way to go, future captain! SHUNSUKE YAJIMA Toru! Sprint practice! Oh, I'll be right there! Sorry. I've got to go. Okay. Shunsuke, catch you later. Hey! Which is more important, track or basketball? Sorry! Don't let him go so easily. He's got a track meet. Nobody is motivated. Don't worry. I'll whip us into shape. -Really? -You bet. I'll do my best. -Hiroko! -Yes? -Come here. -Okay. Yes, you're right. You've got to do your best, right? You've got to show that you mean business, right? What do you mean? What do I mean? Man! What do I mean? Hiroko! TADOKORO Hey, I'm washing clothes. You've got anything? -No, nothing. -Okay. -Hey, Dad. -Yes? Tell me. What's this? Oh, that. I added cheese and made it my own recipe. It's great. -Got it. I'll try it. -Okay. So how's your new school? It's fine. I made friends. It's going well. I see. You're not joining a club? I told you I wouldn't. Yes, you did. But you've got free time. How about cram school? What? No, thanks. How about English school? It would come in handy. Well, I'll think about it. Yoichi played for Hakusui, -then transferred here. -What? -He made the news! -Is Hakusui famous? Heck, yes! They nearly won last year's Winter Cup. -Oh, yes. My bad. -What cup? -The Win-Win Cup? -The Winter Cup! -High school basketball's pinnacle! -That's right. Hey! That's him! He's going to play for us? -I don't know, but he should, right? -Join. -Join. -What? Well, I don't know. What? Honestly, I would rather stick with the members we have. I don't want to win thanks to an elite recruit. Yes, I kind of get it... Don't worry. I'll make us better. Oh, sure. Okay, let's practice! -Practice. -Let's practice with the team we have. Go. I will never forget seeing that movie. Your turn. Yes, I am. I'm Yoichi. Yoichi Tadokoro. Okay! Okay. I held a ball again. Yoichi! -Nice shot! Okay! -Thank you. But I didn't want to go through hell again. Hey! Yoichi! Did you think it over? Will you join us? Ask him, Shunsuke. What? Like I said, I'm not joining any clubs. Why? Because of Hakusui? Sorry. Hey, are you free after school? It's the third-years' last game. It will be fun to watch. You can watch, can't you? Why didn't you ask him? I said, we can win without him. Anyway, he's not interested. -Go for it! -Keep it up! -Go! -Go! -Nice! -Nice! Okay! -That's the other team. -What? They just took the shot. White team, bow. -Thank you! -Thank you! Good effort. -We lost again? -Yes. -That really burns. -It's no big deal. We did our best. Sorry, man. Well, that was fun. -That was fun. -Thanks, guys! -Thank you. -Congratulations. -Thank you. -Like hell it was fun. Like hell it was fun! We lost! Hiroko... What's wrong? Why doesn't it bother you? What? Bother us? We always lose. Why don't you care about losing? Unbelievable. You promised we would win. Sorry. If Yoichi had joined, we might have won! Why didn't you ask him too? If this means nothing, I quit. Okay, this is bad. Well, I think it was a fitting end and a good game. Well... Anyway, third-years, thanks for all your hard work. -Thank you. -Thank you! Nice! Why did I go back there? Even though I swore not to. Amazing. Okay. I don't have one. I quit. What? KAYO TADOKORO What? Bye. Tadokoro. Let's talk later. A three-on-three game to decide. Decide? If I win, you join the basketball club. No, thanks. You don't have to join. What? I mean, if you win, we won't ask you again. Do what you want. Do you hate basketball? It's time for you to show us what you got. Sorry. Hey! Toru! Track practice is starting! -Sorry! On my way! -What are you doing? Oh, right. Can you be a scorekeeper for me? -Let's do this. -Let's go! Tadokoro, let's go. Okay. You. -Ten-minute game. -Isn't that okay? First to 15 points wins. I got it. Three-on-three? -Rock, scissors, paper! I'm offense. -I won't lose this one. My team should lose? Of course! Don't try to win! Got it. -Here. -Okay. -Okay! -Okay! Yusuke! Here! -Nice! -All right! -Three points? -That's three points. Here! Thank you, Koro! Don't worry about it. Sorry, man! Here. Here! Shunsuke! Nice. I'll play point. Hey, Gari, take me on! All right! -Okay. Ready? -Come on! -Bring it on! -Okay. Hey, what was that? What? The ball... Amazing. Like lightning. Hey. You two. Do you like basketball? Yes. Right? Yes. I like it. Okay. What do I call you? Well... Call me Toru. Call me Zono. Toru and Zono? Got it. Zono! I'm going! -Toru! -Here! -Wow! -Yes! Nice shot! TEAM SHUNSUKE TEAM TADOKORO -Hello, miss! -Hello. -Got it, miss. -I'm counting on you. Gari! Here! Miss, that's Yoichi Tadokoro. That's him. But what are they doing? Playing to decide if he joins the club. Defense! -Zono! -And you are? -Wow! -Nice shot! Really! Nice! -Wow! -Yes. -Hey, keep score. -Sorry. Go. Here! Here! Hey! -Toru, nice shot! -Yes! Now! -Gari! -Yes! Shunsuke! Nice! You did it! Amazing! Nice! -Toru. -What? -This is fun, right? -So this is how it feels to win? -Let's do this! -Wait. Here! Here. Nice steal, Yoichi! Here! Here! Toru! Get in! They did it! Wow! What? -We lost. -Wow! We won! -Yes! We won! -See that? -We won! -Yes! Amazing! Yoichi! -Thanks! -Thanks for nothing! Why did you win? Oh, man! -I forgot! -We were supposed to win! We messed up. But damn, that was fun. You know, winning is such a blast. Thanks, Yoichi! I really enjoyed that. I'm glad. Thanks. So, Yoichi, what will you do? Tadokoro. You're good. Well, so are you. I lost, so do what you want. I want to play with you guys. -What? -What? -What? -For real? You said I could do what I want, right? Right. Then I want to join your club. Seriously, man? Really? Hey! You're not kidding? You really want to join? Yes. Yes! -Every day! -Amazing! Why? Mom, I can't help loving basketball. Those guys weren't like Hakusui. I was sure of that. You've got your appetite back. Yes. I had a test today and it made me hungry. Thinking makes you want sweet things. It sure does. Thanks for the meal. Okay, I'll make tea. Okay. I... lied to Dad. I promised I wouldn't join a club, so I couldn't tell him about playing basketball. Everybody calls Yuta Kawasaki "Gari." BASKETBALL NERD "GARI" He's a basketball nerd, but as a player, he's... So why "Gari"? He's thin and his dad is a sushi chef. What about Zono? Koji Makizono joined to get girls, but it didn't work because he still sucks. He said basketballers get girls. What about that freshman? "Koro." Osamu Negoro. He's a beginner, but he's motivated and a good guy. Oh, Toru is really fast on the court. Toru Kawakubo does track too, but it keeps him busy, so he's in and out. Shunsuke is obviously the best player. That's why he's the captain. A killer three-point shooter. CAPTAIN SHUNSUKE Got it. Thanks. So in total, that's... Thanks to you, we've got six members now. They hate practice, so don't get put off. What? Hey! Here! Here! Here! Here! Here! -You're late, you two. -Here! Hurry up! -Yes! -Yes! Take five! Do you guys have your own chant? -Like what? -Oh, we don't. No. Hey, ho! T High, yo! We run the show! Yes, let's go! Win tomorrow! We run the show! Okay! Hiroko asked me to use my experience to create a training program. They all practiced harder than ever. Hey, no water. Got you! Bring it on! Hydrate me! If I get this three-point shot, go out with me. What? Okay. He fixed his shoes! You didn't get it. Toru! We've got the gym from five! Oh, okay! Sorry, I've got to go. Hey! -The track meet is soon! -I know. Toru! See you there! -T High! Fight! -T High! Fight! We were getting better. I could sense it and I was right. Fight! -I think that's totally fine. -Wait up! -Hey. -Hey. Were you talking about something? We've totally changed. Our attitudes are different, and we're fired up. Thanks to Yoichi. No, it's not me. Why the change of heart? Well... Oh, I am learning English at a church. A basketballer called Mr. Morgan is there. -I see. -Mr. Morgan? -Yes. -He told me, no matter how good you are, you can't play alone. That's true. Maybe I'll go with Yoichi next time. Why? To thank Mr. Morgan. He got Yoichi to play basketball again. -Hey, that was because Yoichi saw me play. -What? I know! Let's settle it one-on-one. No, let's not. I'll have to cheer you on. For real? If I don't, you'll lose. No way! We're equals! -I don't know... -We are! -Hey! -Sorry. I've got to go buy food for dinner tonight. Okay! -See you. -See you. Yoichi... See you tomorrow. WASHER 4 I'm home. Do you have anything that needs washing? -No, nothing. -Okay. New members? Yes. Six isn't enough for substitutions or to switch up play. Toru has got track too. Right. But it's too late. Who would join now? Who would join now? It won't be easy. -Well, we might not get many... -Let's give it a try. I did lots of recruiting. Guys who looked well-built or bored. Hey. Yoichi has made it harder for you to show you mean business, so you don't need even more rivals, am I right? Shut your mouth. What's that? Oh, nothing. How about freshmen? Any prospects? -Let's see. -Actually... -There's that really tall freshman! -Right! He's in judo club, -but he's massive. -I heard he quit. -No way! -Perfect. Let's go. -Please take this, Saito. -Sure. -Wow! -Wow! -That's him! -Oh, wow! He's huge. Let's go! Hi there. Kenta Saito, right? We're recruiting for the basketball club. Do you want to join? Why not use that splendid physique on the court? It's okay if you're a novice. -I am too. -Yes. No, thanks. Sorry? I thought he would hit me. Hey, man! Do you like sushi? What? If you join, you can eat all the sushi you want at his place. Hey! I didn't say-- KENTA SAITO He's a giant. Amazing! He'll be great! Way to go, Koro. I didn't do anything... -Amazing. -Hey, Kenta. Let's see you throw. Hey! -Holy crap. -Holy crap. Oh, sorry. I forgot to tell you. He quit judo because he's a chicken. Especially when things come at him. -Right? -Yes. Seriously? Well... Is it okay if I join? Of course it is. Let's have fun. Okay? Sure. He is huge. SUSHI Chef, fluke fin. Yes. Sorry? Oh, we're out of fluke fin... There's still rice. He takes the pass. Blocked! Nice! See that? Amazing, right? Yes. It's great. The basketball? The sushi? Both, yes. Did you see that? -Look! -Hey! Here you go! Take this one. Okay? -Thanks! -What is that? -Where is the sea urchin? -Yuta! -We need to talk! -What? He's eating too much! We're running out! Okay, I got it. -This is delicious! -Thank you, Mr. Kawasaki! Enjoy! Chew it slowly. Sushi is not a drink! Relax, man. We're going to go broke. May I say something? Well, it's a major announcement. -Major? -About what? Well, we've been lucky enough to find new members, so I thought I should act more like a supervisor. I do actually feel bad about not knowing the rules, and not winning. -I'm sorry about that. -It's okay. So I've thought of a goal for you to aim for. -A goal? What? -What? -What? -What? -Help me, Hiroko. -What is the meaning of this? Everybody else, turn around. -What? -It's one of those? -Don't look. -Okay. -This? -What? What is it? Here goes! Ready? Okay, look! -Three, two, one. -Three, two, one. "Qualify for the Winter Cup!" -Yes! -What? You mean the Winter Cup? That Winter Cup. -Excuse me! -Yes? Are you serious? Dead serious. Why? It's way too much. I would love to qualify! Hey, Yoichi, you've played in the cup. -Oh, right! -Right! How was it? The level was so high, it was overwhelming. Really? Even for you? Are you freaking out already? -You're pathetic. -Right? -But I think it's good to have a goal. -Right. -We've got to at least try. -Yes. Let's go for it! Let's all work a miracle together! Why not? -All right! -All right! -Okay! -What's the matter? Let your captain speak. -Nice! -Nice! -Shunsuke! -What is it? Let's all work a miracle together! Sorry, we're all out. -That's not it! -That's not it! Yoichi said that! That was a rerun! -You just repeated him! -He did say that. -A miracle... -Well said, Shunsuke! Anyway, we've got training camp during the summer holidays. A training camp? -Not a camp... -What's wrong? I've got a track meet. -Really? It will work out. -Yes. It won't work out. Sorry. Oh, man... -Yoichi. -Yes? How about a vacation during your summer holidays? Sure. Good idea. You've been too busy with basketball these last few years. Think about where you want to go. Okay. Okay. You reek! -Too bad! I get sweaty, okay? -No, you reek. No, I smell sweet. Oh, no. -What? -What? I left my wallet. -What? -What? Where? At school? I don't know. Hey, can you guys lend me some change? Of course. Why? I want to wash my shirt. Wash it at home. Right. Our washing machine is broken. I'll look for my wallet. -Really? -Really? -See you tomorrow. -Okay. -See you! -See you! You're good. Join the girls' club. Why are you here? Oh, I left my wallet. I see. I liked what you said. What? "Let's all work a miracle together!" You should be the captain. I can't. We've got Shunsuke. Hey, I'm almost done. Let's walk home. Okay. Oh, let me do that. Oh, thanks. Thanks for staying behind. No problem. Thanks for helping. Hi there. Oh, Mr. Yamada! Welcome. Are you up for a fishing trip next week? Yes, count me in! I'll catch more. The chef is my fishing buddy. -Is that right? -Come again, okay? -Take care of him. -Welcome. SUSHI We haven't done this for a while. Yes. How long has it been since your wife died? Seven years? Is your son all grown up? Yes. He's been cooking for us a lot lately. -He's a big help. -I see. Then come back to sales. -No, I've been away too long. -I'm back. Overtime is too... -You again? -I'm a regular! Oh, go to Yanagawa's next, in Sanchome. You're kidding me! Hey, how about a raise? Hell no! You're too lazy! A raise? What for? Going on dates? I've got a training camp next week. Basketball. Your team sucks. You just want pocket money. What? We're serious this year. I mean, this year, we're aiming for the nationals. -That's great! Right, Chef? -Right? I thought he was joking at first. He's all fired up. Well, it's free to dream. Hey, I'm not dreaming. You met that phenom transfer student. He came from Hakusui High. T High is no joke this year. Yes, sure. -Dad, give me a cola. -Drink soy sauce. -What? -Go do your deliveries already! What's the problem? Go on, get out of here! -Go home! -Shut up! Go for it, kid! -We're serious, okay? -Tadokoro. What do you think of the timing? Well, it will be difficult. I'm home. Welcome home. You're late. Yes. Oh, I was with a friend at English school. That reminds me... Good! Dig deep! Keep going! Good! Run! Quick turns! Keep going! Keep going, Kenta! You've got basketball training camp. I heard. When you transferred from Hakusui, you said "no more club activities." Wasn't that your decision? I made things worse for you, and then I asked for a transfer. So I couldn't say I wanted to play. As your dad, I'm not mad at you for joining a club or playing basketball again. I'm mad at you for breaking your word and hiding it from me. In this house, it's just you and me. If we lie to each other, we can't trust each other. Yoichi, is that how family should treat each other? I'm sorry. If you really want to do something, don't be ashamed. What? Play basketball and give it your all. But enjoy it this time. I will! That was the first time Dad encouraged me to play basketball. -Here! -Wow! There it is! -These are great! -Thank you! -Thank you. -This is amazing. -This is big. -Let's get going. -This is great. -How far away is the training camp? Well, about two hours. -Wow! Miss! What do you think? -Hey, that's great! Can you play in it? -Of course we can! -Miss. Miss, Hiroko designed these. -Really? Well done, Hiroko! -Nice! Orange is nice and simple. Dad, hurry up! Shut up! I'm busy... -Good morning. -Good morning. Okay, let's go! -Thank you for taking us. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Hey. Wait up! -What? -What? -What? -Toru? Your track meet... You said you couldn't come! I just quit track. -What? -What? -You quit? -Why? Because my home is T High Basketball Club. -Way to go, Toru! -Let's go! You wear this one. -Amazing! -That's mine! Toru made light of it, but it must have been a hard decision. Our club finally came together for our true beginning. What? What the... What is this? It's a dump! Someone I know recommended it to me. It's a well-kept secret! This is too secret. -We're lucky we've got it. -Exactly. Hello! Oh, sir! Thank you for this. -Hello! -Hello! -You're from Tadano High? -Yes. It's really overgrown. Say what? I'll use this sickle to take your head off! That's scary. He's crazy, man. Crazy. The building is old, -but it's all yours. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Much appreciated. -Excuse us. -What? Are you okay? -That's dangerous. Be careful. -Everybody, run! -Run! Run! -Watch out for cobwebs! -Okay! -Koro, sprint! -Sprint! Nobody has cleaned it! The hoop is calling me! -Okay! -Okay! -Let's do this. -Wow. -Let's go. -Wow. -Move. -Oh, man, it's worse than I thought! -Seriously. -It's filthy. That guy didn't clean it! Okay! Let's clear this up! -Okay! -Okay! Go! Toru, you're fast! -Go for it! You came first! -Kenta. You're so slow. Here! -Kenta, hang in there! -Seriously? Do we have to go this far just for water? Well, it's a good environment for training. I guess. Hey. -The other day, -What? I saw Hiroko shooting hoops alone. She played in junior high. Really? She didn't make the team, but she loves the game. She practiced really hard, then she gave it up. Why? In her second year, her asthma got worse. No wonder. We had played together since elementary school. I felt so bad for her. I tried to play for her sake, but my grades were too low for Hakusui. No, T High is much better. I want to win for once and see her smile. Right. We can win. I know it. Hey! Look! -Quickly! -Stop! Hold him! I'm sorry! -You chicken! -Please don't! Please don't! -Let me go! I'm sorry! -Hey! Hey! Gari! Let's get him! I'm sorry! Let me go! Hey! Are you crazy? -Stop, please! -Are you? What? What's the problem? Hey, this is therapy. He's so chicken-- Apologize to Kenta. You too. What? You scared him for fun, on purpose. So apologize. -What's up with you? -What happened? Hey. Don't get all serious. -It was a joke-- -No, it wasn't. That's just an excuse. Have you ever thought about how he feels? Stuff like that is never okay. You're right. Kenta. I'm sorry. Oh, no. Okay. It's okay. Sorry, Kenta. It's okay. I was wrong. I got carried away. As long as you know. Okay! Back to practice! -Hey, Koro! -Start! -We're going to work a miracle! -Yes! -Okay, use your voices! -Yes! -Over here! -Yes! -Gari! -Yes! -Over here! -Pass! -Hey! -Okay! What about tomorrow? Three-on-three games? Kenta. He's so muscly. He's all muscle. Kenta. -What was that? -Get up! Man! -I wish I could wake up as Kyrie Irving! -You would need more than sleep. Really? -Yoichi. -What? What do national champs teams have that we don't? Talent? Effort isn't enough? -Is it? -Well... We're lacking in training quality and volume. I thought as much. And players with talent train harder. That's how they stay ahead. Can't argue with that. -Yoichi. -Yes? Why are you at T High? Hey, you cut to the chase! I'm going to enjoy this. I was... I was bullied at Hakusui. My friend from junior high got bullied first. Then when I tried to stop it, I became their target. And my friend joined in... That sucks. Bullying is the worst. Today, when Gari and Koro teased Kenta, Shunsuke put a stop to it. Way to go, Captain. I started playing again because I met you and wanted to have trustworthy friends again. That's why I really want to win with you guys. All right! Let's get revenge and kick their asses. -What? -Of course, I mean playing basketball. What was that? Who are you now? -What? -What was that? What was that? I heard something! Hey! -Wait! -Don't push me! Nobody is here. Quickly! -Shut it! Shut the door! -Quickly! You know, I'm a fan of those boys. So I didn't really care if they won or lost. I just wanted them to have fun. They've got to at least try to win. I understand that a little now. You've changed, miss. You hadn't even heard of the Winter Cup. I'm ambitious now. I still don't know the rules though. I want to win. So much. Right. What? Those boys... Don't they need sleep? What's the time? Is it 10:00 p.m.? -Did it go in? -Hey! -Did it go in? -Did it? -Okay! Ready, go! -Ready, go! -Yes! -Nice! Those idiots... They're idiots all right. Looks like it's fun. What are they doing? Let's go. We were bound together tighter than Hakusui were. I knew they were tighter than any of the national championship contenders. OCTOBER Nihon Gakuen in the first round? Can we beat them? No team is easy for us. Hey! That may be so, but don't say it! We'll have to make the final. HAKUSUI What? Yoichi? Oh, Yoichi! How are things? Let's go. You're ignoring us? You play with these losers? What a downfall. -Who are you? -Zono. Are you done? Because you quit, we got suspected of being bullies. Take responsibility, damn it. He's scared. Once a loser, always a loser. Stay home and read manga. -I knew that playing basketball -What is that? meant we would cross paths again. -Even so, as soon as I saw their faces... -What is that? Let's go. ...my fear flooded back. Let's go, Yoichi. Here! Yoichi! Here! Sink it! -Okay! -Don't sweat it! -Close! Don't sweat it! -Okay, next! -Next! -Let's go! -Hey! -Damn, man! What's wrong? You can't lose your mojo now. I haven't. Did meeting them do it? It's not that. They're scared. Scared of you doing well at T High. Don't get it twisted. What happened at Hakusui is our problem now. We've got to fight together and put it past us. -Hey. -What? I've got to go somewhere. Sure, let's go. What? Mr. Morgan is not here. Oh, I wanted to meet him. Yes. All right. Here. Wait. -Yes. -Damn it! -Hey, Shunsuke. -Yes? I'm glad I'm at T High and playing basketball again. I know. -Okay, let's go! -Okay. Over here! -Yes! -Yes! Okay. I thought you could use some competition, so I asked my friend Jun and his team to come. Hello. I'm Jun Sato. I want to see you play, so I brought my juniors. -Nice to meet you! -Nice to meet you! Nice to meet you! Jun Sato? The star college player? What? How does she know him? He's my big brother. -What? -What? -For real? -For real. What? Yes, it is! It's Jun Sato! But why? My sister has told me a lot! -That's me! -Sister? His sister? Really? -What? -Anyway, thanks to these gentlemen, we'll have a practice game. -Really? -Well then. Let's play. -Let's play ball. -Let's play ball. -Really? -What are you doing? Hana! Come with me! Our team is playing Touoh University! We'll lose, so forget it. No! Just come with me! -What? Sorry! -Hey! -Okay! -Here! Here! Look! -Hey! -Hey! Gari! Hey! Zono! -Yes! -Nice! -See? Great, right? -Amazing. -Amazing. -Was that Makizono? Yes, Makizono! -Thank you so much for today. -Thank you. Thank you. They're really good. It will spur them on. I learned a lot. -Thank you. -Thank you. Thanks. -Bye. -Bye. Good game. Thank you. You know, at home... Yes? Hiroko only talks about you. What? Why is that? Sorry. I shouldn't have told you. Oh, how did we play today? Well, that was a great assist for Makizono's shot. You helped the others play better. On the other hand, you passed when you should've shot, as if you were hesitating. Right. A moment's hesitation can lead to a loss. Right. Believe in yourself. Are you ready to lead through your play? When I watched the others, I saw it right away. You've transformed this team. You've harnessed their talents. That's true leadership. You've got an innate ability to make a difference. So believe in yourself. Yes. You'll make it. You can do it. -Hang in there. -Thank you. -Take care. -You too. I realized. Harnessing everyone's talents to the fullest was the key to turning T High into winners. Actually, it was the last pair! I'm so lucky! What a waste. -Why use up your luck on stuff like that? -What? Hey! Broken-in shoes are better. -They're not for a school trip! -It's them! -Long time no see. -There they are. You're that team of losers. Greetings. -Greetings! -Greetings! How are things? Learned the rules? -Yoichi must have taught them. Right? -That's right. Where is Yoichi? Did he quit again? Not again! That was quick! What? Say that again. -Zono... -No violence, please. Big tourney soon. Sorry. -You finished? -Sorry for the wait. Let's go. Man, you need protein... -Hey! -Run! Hey! -Hey! -Hey! Come back, scumbag! Go! -Hey! -Come back here! Come back here! -Get back here! -Hey! He's chasing me! Come here! Okada, that way! -Hey! -Come back here! Damn it! Hey, loser! Come back here, I said! Are you okay? Are you okay? How is Shunsuke? They're examining him. Oh, no... The team needed me. My friends needed me. But what could I do? I've just been to the hospital. He's still unconscious. He has contusions all over, but they're not life-threatening. He'll wake up soon. What a relief. That's good to hear. What about... What? Tomorrow's game... It's too soon to say. We'll just have to have faith. I guess it's up to us. Miss. Let me be captain. What? Just for now. Until Shunsuke comes back. I don't know if I'm up to it, but we've got to keep going forward together. Yoichi. Yes, you're right. Very well. Yoichi. We're counting on you. Yes. WINTER CUP PREFECTURAL QUALIFIERS Are you freaking out? Go! -Hey, get it together. -Your legs are shaking! -Well... -Sorry. -Koro, what's wrong? -What? Stomachache! Give me a break, man. -What's wrong? -What do you mean? You're asking me? I don't know. Come on, people. Time to get psyched up. Miss! I'm a member of this club too. Okay. Let's do this! -Yes! -Yes! -Okay. -Do your best. This is it. Hey! Koro! Hey! -Go! -Do your best! Pass! Hey! Go! -Do your best! -Do your best! -Play defense! -Defense! -Miss... -Defense! Defense! Shunsuke? Put me in. But are you okay? -Here! -Hey! Here! Zono! Shunsuke! Shunsuke! Yes! Nice shot! Shunsuke! You're the best! What? -Shunsuke! -Shunsuke! You awake? Hey, you slept too long! -Really? -Really? Shunsuke! Thank goodness. I was so worried! Why am I... Shunsuke. I'm so glad you're okay. -I'm so glad! -Hey. Shunsuke, I'm sorry. This is my fault. The game! How did we do? Nihon Gakuen, in the first round? Well, how did we do? Did we win? We didn't. What? What? We won. -You're lying! -We won. We aren't. Yoichi was amazing. Here! Toru! Yes! NIHON GAKUEN, 65 TADONO, 71 -Really? -Really. -Careful! -Careful! -What's wrong? -Come on, man. Lie down. -Stay still. -You can't do that. Dumbass. -Don't get carried away. -What? -What? -What is it? Take it easy. -We have the second round. -You need to heal up quickly. TADANO While Shunsuke focused on rehabilitation, T High Basketball Club kept its miraculous run going. We were headed for a showdown with perennial winners, Hakusui High. HAKUSUI, TADANO Sorry! -It's okay. -Makizono! Sorry, I'm practicing. Sorry. Please! Let's go! -Sorry! -No worries! -Throw gently, okay? -Kenta. -Okay. -Nice catch! Then... I'm back! -Ta-da! -Shunsuke! -Shunsuke! -Hey! You're okay now? -Are you all good? -All good! I'm healed. Shunsuke wasn't 100 percent, but he was back. We all wanted to win, more than ever before. So? Back to normal? Well, I'm still rehabilitating. Right. -Yoichi. -Yes? After the qualifiers, date Hiroko. What? You're the one she likes. Get out of here. Why can't you tell? What? So how do you feel about her? Me? Well, I don't know. If you make her cry, you're dead. Seriously? Anyway, let's focus on the final! Here. -Here! Pass! -Enough. Here! Shoot! Go in! Sorry! Here. Nice. SUSHI PRIVATE FUNCTION Well, it's hard to believe, but we're in the final tomorrow. And I'm proud of you all. So tomorrow, it's okay to lose. -No, it isn't! -No way! I mean, it's okay if you win, but I want you to play basketball the way only this team can. -Yes! -Yes! Parents, thank you for your constant support. Now then... Cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers! -Yes! -Yes! -Yes! -Yes! -Yes! -Yes! That's totally it! You aren't eating at all. Yoichi, you led the team when I couldn't. Thanks. You were fighting right alongside us. Weren't you shooting hoops in your dreams? Maybe. That explains it! You possessed Makizono whenever he shot! -That makes sense! -That wasn't me? No wonder they went in! His shots never would! Don't say that. I'm going to play from the start. What? -Don't say that. -I'm going to play from the start. -Hey! -Hey, our captain is back! That hurt! That really hurt! -You hit him too hard! -I need to save my strength for tomorrow! It's great you made such good friends. Yes. Whatever happens tomorrow, you'd better play fair and well. With those T High guys, it will be my best game ever. I acted confident, but I was really worried. Would I be able to play to my strengths against those Hakusui bullies? NATIONAL BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP TOCHIGI PREFECTURAL QUALIFIERS -Hey. -Hey. -Good morning. -Good morning. -I can't wait for this. -This is going to be fun. The final qualifier... Is this a dream? Makizono! I brought Hana. You don't need to tell him. Nana? It's Hana, man. Hey, Zono! I thought you were concentrating on basketball! She'll date me if we win. You sneak! We didn't make the final for you! Mr. Morgan! Yoichi. You came to cheer us on? You're the reason I found a great team. Thank you. Good luck with your game. I want to win this game more than anything else. Can you give me some advice? Yoichi! Emergency! -What? -Quickly! Come on! Wait... What? As I said, players who transferred less than six months earlier are ineligible for this tournament. Surely you knew this? I'm sorry. I didn't know. I was shocked. You were playing for us not so long ago. So Hakusui wins by default, correct? What if I don't play? -Then my team can play, right? -Yoichi. You've played in every game up until now. Your team is complicit. Excuse me. What? -To take your head off! -That's scary. Regarding Tadokoro, I don't see any problem here. What do you mean? The tournament rules state the following. "Players who transfer less than six months earlier are ineligible. However, in unavoidable circumstances, the Basketball Association president or the High School Federation president may issue an exemption." Unavoidable circumstances include bullying, which happened at your school, Mr. Iwata. But that's... Tadokoro, forgive me. I overheard you talking with your teammates. I was... I was bullied at Hakusui. My friend from junior high got bullied first. Then when I tried to stop it, I became their target. And my friend joined in... I couldn't trust anyone anymore. That sucks. Bullying is the worst. -What? -What was that? What was that? -Scary! -Don't push, dumbass! -Don't push me! -Scary! Get off me! That was you? President, is that true? What? "President"? That's right. I took it upon myself to investigate further. If anyone should worry about their eligibility, it should be Hakusui High. In this case, as president, I declare Tadokoro to be eligible. I hope both teams will treat each other fairly, and play a good game. Yes, sir. -We are... -Yes! bound together tighter than any other team! -Yes! -Yes! Let's do the best we can and have fun! -Yes! -Yes! -Yes! -Let's go! T High! Fight! -Yes! -Yes! We can't lose to those nobodies! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! You hear me? Finish them off quickly! -Yes, sir! -Go get them! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! -Let's go, Hakusui! -Yes! Do your best! White team, red team, bow. -Thank you. -Thank you. At last, I faced off against the team that betrayed me. The guys who robbed me of my love of basketball. Take responsibility, damn it. Dad was my only ally. Don't be ashamed. People encouraged me when I least expected it. -What happened at Hakusui -And... is our problem now. ...I made friends, and we became a team. Everything I went through led to this moment. Toru! Here! -Okay! -Yes! Shunsuke! Nice work. -Go! -Do your best! Nice job! Nice! Gari! -Yoichi! -Here! -Shoot! -Sink it! Yes! Nice! Makizono! TADANO, 4 HAKUSUI, 0 Get it! -Okay! -Shoot! -Nice! -Nice! Toru! Shoot! Nice! Yes! -All right! -All right! Gari! See that? That's my son! -Shunsuke! -Do your best! Nice! Thank you! Nice, Koro! -Do it! -Go! TADANO, 31 HAKUSUI, 28 Here! -Kamasaka! Kaiya! -Yes, sir! Warm up. You're going in! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Number two! Here! Hey! HAKUSUI, 34 -Yes! -Yes! TADANO, 35 HAKUSUI, 36 -Okay! -Nice! -Okay! -Nice work! Thanks! What the hell was that? Don't get all cocky now! Snap out of it! -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Guys, that was a great first half. -Yes. -Thank you. Let's keep it going in the second half. -Yes! -Yes! Okay, substitution time. Really? Kenta. Me? You're on for Koro. -What? -Do your best. What? Well... Let's enjoy this, Kenta. Okay, Kenta! Do your thing! -Let's go! One more point! -Let's go! One more point! -Let's go! One more point! -Let's go! One more point! HAKUSUI, 38 TADANO, 35 -Win! Hakusui! -Win! -Win! Hakusui! -Win! HAKUSUI, 51 Do your best! -Keep it up! -Don't sweat it! Miss. Let me go on. Shunsuke, it's too soon! Miss, I'll be okay. Okay, you want in? Miss! We've come this far together. Everyone should play. Winning this game isn't as important as making it something to remember. Thank you. Substitution! Gari. Over to you. -I've got four. -Good idea, seven. Nice! -Keep it up! -Do your best! Don't let them score! There! Set up! -Shunsuke! -Here! Go! Yoichi! Zono! Shunsuke! Get into position! Go! HAKUSUI, 52 TADANO, 42 Number two! Wow! Kenta! Nice! Kenta! Here! Shunsuke. TADANO, 45 HAKUSUI, 52 Timeout! Stop! Okada, take out Tadokoro. But we can win without that. Don't think. Just do what I tell you. I told you, so do it! You all got that? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. -Kenta! -Yes! Foul! That was a push! -Yes! -Yes! HAKUSUI, 54 Sorry! Nice! Shunsuke! Keep it up! Hakusui's cowardly strategy to gang up on me is breaking up our rhythm. HAKUSUI, 56 Our passes are failing, and the gap keeps widening. Does winning justify cheating? Our anxiety and frustration weigh heavily on us. The clock's ticking down. It's not over yet! Yoichi! Go for it! Shunsuke! Yes! HAKUSUI, 62 TADANO, 56 -Kenta! -Yes! Nice! Mom, I love my life. August 28th. Today's game was wonderful. You always called out, encouraged each other, and played with a smile. I'm so proud. Yoichi. No matter how hard life gets from now on, stay true to yourself, be honest with your friends, and become a wonderful team. That's how you should play. That's what you can do. I'm absolutely sure of that. From your number one fan, Mom. Fight, Yoichi! Basketball is fun. Mom, thank you for giving me courage. Single free throw! Damn it! HAKUSUI, 62 TADANO, 62 Single free throw! Just one more. Just one more. HAKUSUI, 62 TADANO, 63 Ikeda! Yes! Red team, bow. -Thank you! -Thank you! Yes! Yes! -Yes! -Yes! -We did it! -Yes! We did it! I'm glad I joined the basketball club! I'm so glad! Thank you, everyone! Thank you! So cool! -Yes! -Yes! Nice! I'll never forget this! I'm so happy! You were great! You lost to those nobodies. Do you want to ruin my reputation? Sorry. I'm beat. BASKETBALL -Yoichi. -What's up? How do we prep for the Winter Cup? -What? -The Winter Cup. First, let's eat sushi at Gari's place. -Great idea! -Count me in! Meeting these guys has made me happier than ever before. Just Gari. Thank you so much, T High Basketball Club. I guess Mr. Morgan is gone. I wish I could have met him. Before the final, he gave me a pep talk. He told me I had to trust you guys. Oh, sir. -Hello there. -Hello. When will Mr. Morgan be working here next? -Mr. Morgan? -Yes. The tall man from overseas. I think he's the janitor. No one like that works here. No, we shot hoops together here. You mean him? Mr. Morgan. See you around. I'm going to sink a three in the Winter Cup. I'll dunk then! I'll go past five players. Sweet! -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! -Hey, Yoichi! We were talking about your sweet free throw. Man, I was so nervous. You were so cool! -Our new captain! -Hey! New captain! But it was Shunsuke who got him to join. -Yes, good point. -As expected from our old captain! -Hey! Old Captain! -Hey! Old Captain! Drop the "old!" Koro! -Hey, Yoichi. -What? Let's decide who is the real captain, new or old! -One-on-one. -No. The winner dates Hiroko. -What? -Is that okay with you? I don't get it. Why me? You're on. Let's bet on who wins! -I say Yoichi! -Me too! -Hey! -I say the ex-captain. Shunsuke! -Don't say "ex," damn it! -What did you mean by that? Mom, can you hear my voice? Right now, I'm enjoying every day with these guys, thanks to what you said to me. Actually, now I know what I want to be. I'll tell you sometime. For now, I want to play basketball with these guys forever. HOW ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE T HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL CLUB?
