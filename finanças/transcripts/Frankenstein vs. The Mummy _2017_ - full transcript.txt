(eerie music playing) (water dripping) Did anyone see you? Don't insult me. Here. There's another list in there. I need another delivery next week, same deal as before. Just this? It's the last of it. Listen to me. This time it is imperative that this specimen be as fresh as possible. Zero decay, fully intact, no incisions. You understand? Yeah, I get it. As from now we don't know each other. You don't acknowledge me, you don't mention my name. You see me in the hallway, you look the other way. Got it? Not even a cup of coffee? I'm serious, Carter. Don't worry, Doc. I'm not looking to make any friends here. Good. Hey, Doc... Have a nice night! Morning, class. Welcome to the Philosophy of Medicine. Victor: What is philosophy? Anyone? Female student: The study of wisdom. Yes, very good. Male student: The nature of existence? Victor: The nature of existence. What does it mean to exist? That's a tricky one, I know. It's like asking what is the meaning of life, isn't it? Why are we here? Why must we die? Must we die? Where does it say we must die? Obviously we, and that is to say all living organisms, are bound by certain laws of physics, laws that ensure that we age, that our molecular structure breaks down over time. Why must our shells be so vulnerable to our surroundings, the elements, each other? These laws are against us every day, but laws can be broken. It is our job to make them obsolete. So, what are we really trying to do? We've already achieved quite a bit, haven't we? Just look at our advances over the past hundred years. The black plague is nearly a fantasy, a bed time story to tell our children. Limbs are being fused with machines, science fiction is becoming reality - and yet we continue to strive. - (bubbling) Why don't we just plateau? What is it that we are trying to achieve? Male student: Immortality. Immortality! The nature of existence is to continue to exist, but who continues to exist? God. The gods. The gods live forever and they are everything we long to be. Well, I have news for you. They're us. We are them and they are us. God is not a boundary, it is an achievement. Each and every one of you chose this field because deep down you realize that the two most important things in this world are to give a life or to take a life... ...and to wield that power, why that is to wield the hand of God. (suspenseful music plays) OK, class, I'm sure most of you know that I've been away on an expedition in Giza for the past couple of months, so I thought it would be pretty cool if we talked a little bit about the great pyramids. Now everyone knows that pyramids were tombs for ancient Egyptian kings, but more importantly, they were a symbol of supreme power. A place where kings transformed into gods, but how were these divine monuments built? Aliens! (soft laughter) Aliens? Of course! Just out of curiosity, a show of hands. How many of you actually believe that aliens built the pyramids? Come on, guys! Do you not have any pride in your own species, in human potential? For all the shameful things we've done over time, this is something spectacular and you want to take it away? But, Professor K., you've got to admit the evidence is all there. I mean we couldn't build those things today if we wanted to, let alone 4,000 years ago. There's no way. Look, just because we're not building pyramids in modern society doesn't mean we can't! Priorities have changed. I mean, do you really think that the US government would cripple its resources and employ 100,000 people just to prove that we can build pyramids? OK, so how did they transport these 50 ton blocks, without the wheel, hundreds of miles? I don't know! Laser beams, teleportation devices! First of all, limestone blocks didn't weigh 50 tons. It was more like two and a half, and although they did have the wheel, they used something just as effective called the sledge. Imagine Santa's sled, only bigger. And if you're familiar with the Nova Experiment then you would know that a two and a half ton block can be easily dragged by as few as 12 men. Male student: A lot of people disagree with you. You know that, right? - A lot of people? - Uh-huh. You know, at one time... a lot of people thought the Earth was flat. At one time, a lot of people thought that a lot of other people were witches and burned them at the stake! Sometimes, "a lot of people" just means a lot of stupidity and I'm really hoping this class prevents you from turning into one of them. (soft laughter) (school bell ringing) Can I carry your books, teacher? Victor, how are you? Better... now that you're here! I've brought you something. What's this? Your welcome home present. Aw Victor, but you didn't have to do this! Thank you. Well, I wanted to make sure you didn't forget about our date tonight. Date? Did we have plans? (laughs) - Funny! - Of course I didn't forget! So, how was your expedition? Did you bring back something amazing? Word travels fast, huh? Yeah, I've heard some things! Oh, yeah? What sort of things? Like maybe you came back with one man extra? Um, technically, that's confidential information at this point. - So it's true? - I didn't say that! Come on! (sighs) What time's your next class? Not for another 40 minutes. - OK, follow me! - Yes! Naihla: Hey, Isaac! Isaac: Good morning! This is my friend Victor, he's a professor here. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, you too. Isaac is an anthropologist who was a member of our team in Giza. Ah, very cool. We were just popping in. Would you mind if I show Victor our new guest? Oh no, no, course! Come on! Naihla: Here he is! (suspenseful music playing) Victor: This is incredible! It's not every day that you get to stand before an ancient Egyptian King, is it? King? Userkare, predecessor of Pepi I from the Sixth Dynasty. Sixth Dynasty? Well that would make him, what, 3,000 years old? Yeah, give or take! So, did you hear the news? What? Well, supposedly Professor Walton wants to perform the autopsy Bi-org. Bi-org? In England? So I'm told. Well what's the point of shipping the specimen all the way from Giza to New York if it's gonna end up in Europe? I don't understand why we just can't do it here? Supposedly he wants to hire a biologist from Bradford that absolutely refuses to fly. (laughing) I think the professor just likes travelling abroad on the university's dime! Isaac: Yeah, I think you're right! Victor: What happened to his ears? This doesn't look like decay. It looks like somebody removed them. Very good. Very observant. They were removed, sliced off with a dagger while he was still alive, to be precise! Naihla: Along with a few other parts! Oh, he must have really pissed somebody off! (chuckles) You don't know the half of it! Userkare for a king, I'm not familiar with the name. Naihla: It would be really impressive if you were. So very little is known about him. That's what makes this one of the most significant finds in the past few centuries! And according to Naihla, one of the most dangerous. Why dangerous? - Isaac! - What? Well... We uncovered a scroll and it was Userkare's tomb. It was in an ancient text that we haven't seen before. Naihla was able to translate the inscription. According to the scroll, Userkare's soul was still trapped inside his body, cursed for all eternity. Any who dared try to release it are doomed to an agonizing death! Right. Isn't that right, Naihla? Yeah, something like that! Oh, so how do you release the soul? Well, conveniently that part of the scroll is missing! Of course! Don't get too close! It's not safe! Userkare won't bite! (laughs) I promise you! Professor, good to see you again. Victor. Naihla: I'm so sorry, Professor. I know we're not permitted to bring anyone up here. It's all right, Naihla, we'll make an exception for the young doctor here. After all, who better to aid us in the study of ancient anatomy! I'm afraid I won't do you any good. I only deal with the living! Walton: That's unfortunate! There's an ocean of knowledge to be discovered within the remains of Userkare. And the curse? Stories, Victor, a fear tactic used in order to prevent others from tampering with the remains, that's all there is. I can assure you, my dear, that Userkare's soul has long since retired from this body. Oh, gee, I hope I didn't get you into any trouble. No, not at all! Professor Walton is actually very fond of you. He talks a lot about you. Oh, really? What does he say? That you're a whizz kid and smarter than most of the people that he's ever come across in the field of medicine. That's very kind of him. Not true, but very kind! Look, Professor Walton does not mince words and he rarely ever brags about anyone. Personally, I disagree with him. Is that right? Yeah, I don't think you're as smart as people say you are. - Really? - Yeah. Why's that? Well if you were smart then you'd have asked me out a lot sooner! (both laughing) Hey, better late than never! I'll see you tonight. Don't forget to text me your address. I won't! (eerie music playing) Good morning. Morning, Professor. (cars speeding by) Carter: How's it going, pal? You got any extra? Pull up a seat, friend. Thank you. (spits) (chuckles) Man, how you eat this shit? Oh, you get used to it! I've eaten way worse! Well, I'm sorry about that. Well, this always helps. It's freezing out here. Is this where you sleep? Right where you're sitting. Isn't there a shelter around here? Some place warm? Shelter? I'd rather be in prison! I've seen some things happen in those places you wouldn't believe! I believe anything. You know you're not allowed to bring personal belongings to those places, right? They're afraid you're gonna smuggle in drugs or lice. I had an orderly once throw out my bag while I was asleep. Scumbags! You see this blanket? It was my daughter's. I'd rather be out here in the cold than to give this up. Where's your daughter now? Can't she help you out? I don't wanna talk about that. Oh... I understand. It's a tough world, no doubt about it. I'll tell you what, pal. Since you've been so generous to me, I'll be straight with you. I'm not really in dire straits. No. I make a decent living over at the university. - Come on! - I'm serious! I thought you looked too clean. (chuckles) See, I'm telling you the truth, and because I'm such a nice guy I'm gonna help you out. Oh, bless you, friend. I knew you were a good man when I saw you-- (screams) (shushing) Easy now. (muffled moaning) Easy. It's for the best. Just think of your daughter. That's it, that's it. That's it. (suspenseful music playing) (slicing) So, tell me more about your work. Clearly you love what you do. I do, that's the reason why I wake up in the morning. What is it about archaeology that excites you? Lots of things. It's amazing to see where we came from, how far we've progressed or how little, to uncover our notion of knowledge buried by the sands of time. What's greater than discovery? Can I ask you something? Sure! Userkare, the curse... Do you really believe in all that stuff? If I said yes would that be a deal breaker for us? No, not at all! I'm just interested. Don't patronize me. I know you think it's ridiculous! Whoa. I didn't say that. You didn't have to, I know your type! My type? Yes, your type! You believe in science so that probably means that you're an atheist, but judging by your arrogant reputation, my guess is that you're most likely a Satanist! A Satanist? Really! Yes, a Satanist. You believe that men are their own gods. What's wrong with that? Nothing. I just think it's sad if you believe we're on this earth for such short amount of time just to end up in a wooden box covered in maggots. Fair enough. So what about you, Victor? When did you first realize that you wanted to get into medicine? Um, at a very young age. And, did something profound occur that inspired you? I just wanted to help people. I suppose that's a good answer! (suspenseful music plays) (slicing) - (gas hissing) - (coughing) (Walton coughing) (coughing, wheezing) Hey, listen, I hope I didn't offend you with the whole curse thing. No, not at all. You know, my grandfather was an anthropologist in Cairo. He led many expeditions for over 50 years. In 1932, he was part of a team who discovered a tomb in Abusir. There were many, many great treasures. Needless to say, many of the men thought it would be a good idea to take some home for themselves, all but my grandfather who knew that it was cursed. He begged and pleaded with the men to leave the treasures behind, but no one listened. And within a year, every single person on that team was dead. Except your grandfather? Wow! There are powers on this earth greater than anyone can imagine. My grandfather believed this... ...and so do I. (coughing) (hissing) (air whooshing) (eerie hissing) (faint screeching) (scraping) (air whooshing) (high-pitched hissing) (door slamming) It's gotten even colder, if you can believe that. I've got you a sandwich if you're hungry, Professor. You haven't eaten since this morning. Professor? Professor! - Do you want me to get help? - I'm all right. Well, you don't look all right. What's-- What happened in here? (eerie music playing) What's that? It's the eye! Jesus! Where did you find this? It was embedded in his ribcage. (stifled laugh) This guy, he's full of surprises! It's incredible! Oh, this is easily the oldest symbol of the Eider day. The boys are gonna go ape-shit when they see this! You know, technically we don't have to tell anybody about this. You could call up that rare antiquities dealer in Dubai. It would be our little secret. Oh, come on, Professor! I'm just joking! (slicing) (gasping, choking) (ripping) (suspenseful music playing) (squelching) (heart beating) I had a really great time tonight and so did my belly! (chuckles) Good, I'm glad! Can I tell you something? Of course! I've never told anybody what I'm about to tell you. I guess I've never felt this close to anyone. OK... I did get into medicine for a reason. My mom killed herself when I was just a boy. I found her in her bathtub. She had slit both her wrists. (soft music playing) I stayed with her for days, you know. She was like a block of ice. It wasn't until around three days later that the cops showed up. They had to pull me away from her. I remember they had to pry our fingers apart. Victor, I'm so sorry. It shouldn't have to be that way, it doesn't have to. Victor, look at me. I'm so sorry. You know what I wish? I wish that I'm wrong about everything... ...and I hope then when I die I'll get to see her again... ...just to see her smile. (siren blares in background) (music playing) (bells ringing) (eerie music playing) Isaac! Professor Walton? (water dripping) (heart beating) Professor Khalil! God, Professor. You scared me! Skittish as a kitten. Who's been tampering with the remains? What do you mean? Well, here, look at the chest cavity. Something was removed. Oh, yes, that is odd. Was Isaac down here last night? Possibly. The last I saw of him was yesterday afternoon. I'm sure he would have called me if he'd found anything of significance. Well that's what concerns me. Isaac wouldn't have done this and he's not even authorized to do so. (high-pitched hissing) Professor! Professor, are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. Lately I've been having these horrible migraines. Well maybe you should go home and get some rest. No, I've got a lecture to give this afternoon. I'll be all right. - Are you sure? - Oh, yes. Quite sure. OK. (straining) Victor: Need some help? Victor, what are you doing here? Spying on you! I can see that! What have we got here? "Ancient Egyptian Spells and Mysticism". Don't even... I didn't say anything! This book looks like it's about 300 years old. Why did you leave this morning? You're mad at me? You could have said goodbye. You just looked so peaceful I didn't wanna wake you. I'm here now, right? I suppose it's better you didn't startle me anyway. I'm not used to having a man in my bed and I keep a very large knife hidden underneath my mattress! Good to know for future reference! Future reference? What makes you think you'll ever be back in my bed again? I can think of a few reasons! Victor... So when can I see you again? Tonight? - Tonight? - What time? Eight o'clock. OK. It was during this borrowed time with Osiris, that Isis conceived a child, Horus. (high-pitched hissing) (muffled hissing) Longing to avenge his father's death, Horus challenged Set to a series of contests which lasted nearly 80 years. After endless battles of strength and wit, the gods declared Horus the victor and the rightful heir to the throne of Egypt. (high pitched hissing) Walton: I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me. And that's all there is for today. (students muttering) Lenora: Feel better, Professor. Yes, thank you. Lenora, isn't it? Yes. Professor Desai told me you were her brightest student. She also told me that your dissertation was exceptionally good. I don't know about that! Don't be modest! You're a beautiful, intelligent young woman. I'd like to talk to you about an internship position. It could be extremely advantageous to your career. Why don't you stop by in my laboratory later this evening so we can discuss it? I don't know what to say, thank you. It's my pleasure. Ten o'clock all right? Ten o'clock is perfect. - See you tonight. - Bye, Professor. Victor: Tuesday, February 2nd, 2014, Time is 7:26 pm. Subject has retained animation for one month, one hour and 18 minutes and 18 seconds to be exact. Appendage has shown considerable signs of rejuvenation despite independence of blood vessels in major arteries. Base color of the specimen is now an off-yellow as opposed to the heavy bruising that was evident only a few days ago. (glass clinking) Sensitivity in specimen is becoming more acute. (sound of flesh cutting) Current reflex to pinpricks suggest discomfort or even pain. It's warm. The serum works. The data is conclusive. Full body reanimation is a go upon final delivery of specimen. (faint clattering) Who's there? (creaking) Jesus, Carter! Carter: I've got to hand it to you Doc, for a lab rat, you have excellent taste in women! Professor Khalil. Tell me, Doctor, how she smell? You gotten those panties yet? Did you bring what I asked for? - Got it right here. - Let me see it! That's perfect. Oh it's fresh, Doc, real fresh. So fresh there's probably some marbles still roll around in there! That's the idea. Good work, man. Yep. Business first. Oh and Doc... There's one mighty issue we need to discuss. What's up? Well, since this item was a little harder to come by, five grand just ain't gonna cut it. What are you talking about? We said five grand for delivery. - What are you doing? - Renegotiating our agreement. I know it stings, Doc... ...but it is what it is. Jesus Christ, what are you doing down here? I mean the limbs are one thing but you've got enough chemicals down here to... wipe out a small country! Don't do that! Take it easy, Doc. Listen, moron, a lot of this stuff is highly combustible. We wouldn't want anything nasty to happen to you. You're alright, Doc. Nice to see you haven't lost your sense of humor. Just tell me what you want. I want 30 grand in exchange for the brain. Don't say you ain't got it. I've seen that silver spoon sticking out of your ass the minute I laid eyes on you. You want me to pay you 30 grand for something I can lift from the University morgue? Thirty grand just ain't for supplies. For me keeping my mouth shut. And if you say no, I'll blow the lid off this demented little science experiment here. You think I won't bring you down with me? You can try! But I don't think you want to be accessory to murder. (suspenseful music playing) What are you talking about? You said you wanted fresh! Jesus! That's right, Doc, so if I were you, I'd quit making threats. You're insane! (laughing) I'm insane? You know one of these days you need to look at yourself in the mirror, Doc! (squelching) What the hell is that? (dramatic music playing) What the fuck? (screams) (clattering) (grunts) Victor: Fuck! (screaming) (screams) (knife slicing) (Victor breathing heavily) (strained grunting) (breathing heavily) (suspenseful music playing) You, greedy mother fuck! (sobs) It was perfect! (sobs) Fuck! (suspenseful music plays) (strained grunting) (action music plays) (electric saw whirs) (alarm blaring) - Live! - (discharge sound) - Yes! - (electronic fizzling) Yes. Come on, live. - Come on! - (fizzling continues) Come on! Come on, live! - Come on, you son of a bitch! - (rapid beeping) No, no, come on, live, live! Come on! (explosions) (alarm blaring) (powering down) No... No, no, don't do this to me! Come on! Come on! Come on! Fuck! Fuck! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! (whimpering) (rapid beeping) (groans) (vomits) Asshole! Professor Walton? Hello, Professor? Walton: Extraordinary, isn't it? Oh, Professor! I'm sorry, I have the tendency to do that. It's OK. Well... what do you think? It's amazing, so well-preserved. You'd be amazed at how well preserved he actually is. Would you like to touch him? What? Go ahead! No, I shouldn't! Oh, come on. He won't harm you. Walton: Doesn't it feel just like worn leather? Hard to believe this was once warm yielding flesh, just as alive as you and I are at this very moment. So, um, did you want to discuss that internship with me? I'm selecting three students to assist me in Userkare's autopsy at Bio Ark in York. I want you to be a member of my team, Lenora. I'm flattered. Yes, I accept. I could see the passion in your eyes this afternoon when you were listening to my lecture. Did you enjoy it? Yes, you tell it so well it's almost as if you were actually there. Sometimes I feel as if I were. You know there are many similarities between Osiris and Userkare. Really? Like what? Well, for instance, like Osiris's brother, Set, Userkare was also an usurper. He murdered his own father, Teti, and succeeded his older brother, Pepi, the rightful heir to the throne. But Pepi eventually became king, didn't he? So what happened to Userkare? Userkare was a tyrant, a monster. It wasn't long before those closest to him conspired with Pepi to put an end to his reign of terror. He was betrayed by his own guard and put to death, but not before his sensory organs were removed, one by one. First his tongue, then his nose, next his ears. His eyes were allowed to remain so that he would be able to watch as his phallus was sawn off and thrown to the dogs. The infamous brain removal tool-- he was still alive when the priests began to embalm him. Oh, my God! Legend has it that Pepi summoned a powerful sorceress to cast a spell upon Userkare's soul. A spell that would prevent Userkare from ever entering the joyous gates of the afterlife and all the glories that it-- (screams) (growling) (Lenora screaming) Professor, please let me go, please! (screams) (splattering, squelching) (heart beating) (suspenseful music playing) (grunting) (growls) Please, don't kill me! Oh, God, don't! Professor Khalil. (speaking in foreign language) Naihla, I shall bring her to you, great king. (roars) (suspenseful music playing) (metallic clattering) (grunting) (footsteps) (growls) (struggling) (screams) Oh, fuck! (heavy breathing) (coughs) I did it! It's alive. It's alive! She didn't mention to you where she was going? Anything wrong? Naihla: Professor? What's going on here? Can I... help you, miss? Oh, it's alright. She works here. It's Professor Khalil. Oh, do you mind if I ask you to step outside? I'd like to have a few words with you once I'm done here? - Sure. - Thank you. Just be a second. (hushed talking) Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy! (growls) Nobody's gonna hurt you. (grunting) The subject is aggressive. He's only displaying primitive and animalistic behavior. - I guess the transplant... - Water! What did you say? (grunting) (attempts to speak) - Water! - You can speak. - Water! - Water. Of course! Um... Here you go. - (grunting) - Mmm! It's good, huh? Refreshing? Victor: Subject spoke. He asked for water. There's no telling what he's capable of at this point. What about... words? Hmm? Reading? Can you read this word? What does that word say? Come on! Ca-- Come on, I put those vocal chords in there myself. I know they work. - Cat! - Cat, yes! That's very, very good! Very good! And this word? How about that word? Psy... Psy... Psychology! You can read on your own? That's incredible! What about the book next to it? - Chloroform. - Chloroform, yes... Hey! Easy! You wanna write something, huh? Here. Anything at all. F... O... O... Food! Food... - Food! - Food, yes! Food! (angrily) Food! Yes, food! If you want something to drink, of course you want food! (growls) Walton: If you need anything else, - just let me know. - I will, thank you. - Morning, Professor. - Morning. Professor, sorry for the disruption. I'm not gonna need that much of your time. - So you're a cop? - Detective, actually. - What's going on? - Do you know this girl? Her name was Lenora Samuels. She's a student here. No, I've never seen her. Well, she attended Professor Walton's lecture yesterday afternoon. Now, a friend of hers said that she paid him a visit last night at the lab. She hasn't been seen or heard since. Are you familiar with any of this? No, I haven't been to the lab since yesterday morning. The old man inside... does he have a habit of inviting young girls down to his office after hours? Not that I know of. I appreciate your time. Um... If you hear or see anything, please let me know. - Thank you. - Excuse me, Officer. Yeah? Would you mind telling me what Professor Walton told you? Well, he invited her down to discuss an internship. They talked for a few minutes and then she left. That's it. So... if you hear anything. Thank you. (suspenseful music playing) What's going on, Professor? Just a misunderstanding. Poor girl. I certainly hope nothing has happened to her. Well what was she even doing down here, and what is this internship? What are you talking about? The board has allowed me three undergraduate assistants. I offered one of the spots to Lenora and she graciously accepted. Well the board didn't notify me of this. Well you do work for me and naturally the board would inform me first, yes? (chuckles) Have you heard from Isaac lately? I haven't, and neither has any of his family. You were the last person to talk to him, weren't you? That sounds like an accusation. Just exactly what are you implying, Naihla? You tell me, Professor! Tell you? Tell you what? You're talking nonsense, utter nonsense. It seems as though your headaches are getting worse. It's not so bad. They come, they go, they pass. Come here. I've been meaning to show you something. That's it, closer. Closer. Do you remember that chest cavity you discovered? I found something intriguing that might interest you. Why don't you have a look for yourself? See for yourself. - No! - What? Don't be silly! Come back here! - I have to go, Professor. - Naihla, we have work to do! See you later tonight! Professor Kahlil! Professor F! Missed you in class today. I had to leave for a few hours, family emergency. Oh? I hope everything's OK. Yes. Everything's fine. What was your name again? - William. - William, right. I just want to tell you that what you said in class last week about wielding the hand of God... I just wanted to tell you how inspiring that was. Oh, thank you, I really appreciate that, William. No, thank you and it got me thinking about a lot of things and I wanted to tell you-- Listen, I'm in a bit of a hurry. We can talk about this next week after class, all right? I just wanted to tell you that I read about your work in Switzerland. My what? Your work... in Switzerland. You know, with Dr. Grunner. How did you hear about that? If you dig deep enough, you can find anything. Is it true? About the experiments? Reanimating dead tiss-- You listen to me right now, you little shit! You don't tell a soul about that, do you hear me? You keep your goddam mouth shut. OK, I'm sorry. I just... I thought that maybe I could help you, OK. Sorry. Victor: Naihla, hey, wait up! - What do you want? - Look, I'm sorry. I know I fucked up. Are you just gonna walk away? You know, Victor? I really thought you were different from most guys. - I actually fell for it! - Naihla... I fell for it and you got what you wanted. Bravo! That is not true at all! I care about you, Naihla. I'm just involved in some things that I can't... - I don't know how to... - Victor, really. You don't have to stand here and try to explain yourself to me. Do what you have to do, whatever is most important. Look, no hard feelings, OK? I'll see you around. Let me make it up to you. Just give me another chance. I don't wanna lose you, Naihla. That stuff I told you about when I was a kid... I've never let anybody in like that. I can't even explain it. It's just when I'm with you... I feel connected. Please, I have to see you again. Just give me a second chance. Victor... - What's that on your hand? - It's nothing. Jesus, is that a bite mark? Victor, where were you last night? Answer me! What aren't you telling me? I'm working on something, OK? Working on what? I can't tell you. - Can't tell me? - I will, I promise, as soon as the time is right. Please, you just have to trust me. Why are you looking at me like that? I have to go. Naihla! (engine starts up) (suspenseful music playing) (leaves crunching) (suspenseful music plays) (suspenseful music plays) Victor: Hey. Sorry that took me so long. Look what I've got! (grunting) There you go! Smells good, huh? (grunting) Victor: Tasty? Victor: Mmm. (splutters) Whoa, whoa, hey! You're eating too much, too fast! Your digestive system can't handle that much food yet. Fine, suit yourself. You're just gonna get sick again. (glass clanking) (vomiting) - Give me that. - Monster: Get away! (clattering) (screams) (chains rattle) Naihla! Naihla! (screaming) - Naihla, stop screaming! - Victor, what is that thing? Calm down! Stop screaming! - Let me go! Let me out of here! - Calm down! Fuck. Naihla! Naihla! (sobbing) Naihla, please! Don't. Please, just let me explain. I'm gonna take my hand off from your mouth. You have to promise me you're not gonna scream. What did you do, Victor? - What was that thing? - I did it, Naihla! Did what? That thing you saw down there, that living, breathing creature... I created it! I reanimated it from dead tissue! I gave it life! This can't be happening! Do you understand what I'm telling you? I've defeated the very thing that has plagued mankind since we first perceived our own mortality. I've cheated death! I don't know who you are! Don't say that. Stop looking at me like I'm insane! You are, Victor! You're just too blind to see it! Now let me go! Please, Naihla, just calm down. - I'm gonna scream! - Naihla... If you don't want 50 people here in the next two seconds, you'd better let me go right now! Naihla, please! Just don't say anything! (growls) (snapping) - (chains rattling) - (grunts) (suspenseful music plays) (indistinct speech over police radio) (suspenseful music playing) (indistinct speech over police radio) (growls) (growls) (shattering) (loud bang) (indistinct speech over police radio) (indistinct speech over police radio) (indistinct speech over police radio) (indistinct speech over police radio) Dean, come in. Dean, where the fuck are you? Dean: Yeah. What do you want? You've gotta get down here-- - (growls) - (screams) (screams) (screams) (indistinct speech over police radio) (growls) (indistinct speech over police radio) Oh, my God! Monster: Hello, Doc! Carter. (growls) (rattling) What do you want? What do you think? I want out of this rotting corpse. Your flesh will rejuvenate. It takes time. No. There is no time. If you transplanted my brain into this body that means you can transfer it into another. I don't know what you want me to do. You're gonna find me another body tonight. A young, healthy body. Not one comprised of the dead. I can't do that. Well, you don't have a choice. I can't just kill someone! You killed me! You were threatening me! Well, I'm threatening you now. If you don't do this for me, you'll never see Naihla again. Don't touch her. I'm gonna pay her a visit tonight. I'm gonna bring her to a place where no one will ever find her and no one will hear her screams. It stings, doesn't it? Can you feel that? That pain can be so much worse, believe me. I can make you suffer more than you ever thought possible. Now, do this for me. Afterwards, I'll take you to her and you'll never see me again. Carter, please. Please! I'm not Carter. I'm just a monster. Let's see if you still have that address. Yeah. Stoney Brook Lane, man. I know just where it is. Son of a bitch! I'll fucking kill you! Sit tight, Doc! I'll be back soon. Victor: Don't touch her, you hear me? Don't you touch her! - Oh, God! - (rats squeaking) (coughs) (rats squeaking) Jesus Christ! (Userkare growls) (struggling) (roars) Fuck! Help! Help! (knocking on door) Who is it? Hello! (tapping) Who's there? Victor, is that you? If you don't answer right now, I'm calling the police. (cell phone vibrates) Victor, is that you? God. Why won't you answer me? (knocking on door) (suspenseful music plays) - Operator: 911 emergency. - Yes. Someone's trying to get in my house. - Can you please send help? - Operator: OK, just stay calm. What is your location? 2670 Stoney Brick Lane. Operator: Sit tight. The police are on their way. OK. (gasps) Oh, my God! Operator: Ma'am, I need you to talk to me. They just cut the power. I'm really scared! Please hurry! Operator: Everything's gonna be OK, don't worry. Is the intruder in the house? I don't think so, but I don't know. Operator: Make sure all the doors are locked. Are there any other ways into the house? Basement, backyard? No, everything's locked. Operator: Windows? (wind whistling) (crying) Hello, Professor. So nice to see you again. What do you want? My, you're so beautiful. Please, stop, please! If you scream, I'll tear you into shreds. Look at me. - No. - Look at me! You see what he did to me? Your loving Victor? Where is he? What have you done to him? Nothing yet. I need him to get me out of this body, and you're gonna ensure that he does it. No. It's been so long since I've tasted a woman like you. Stop! We're leaving now. But first, I want you to give us a kiss. No! Stick out your tongue! I said stick out you're fucking tongue or I'll rip it out of your throat. Yeah! (crying) (groans) No, no, no, no! Let me go! (dogs barking) (music playing) Professor, why? You were right, Naihla. You were right. The curse is real. Userkare lives... ...and he wants you! (chuckles) He believes you're the sorceress who damned his soul for eternity. I hope you've had extensive training in the black arts. You're gonna need it! No! No! (groans loudly) Don't scream! Don't make even the slightest sound. He will kill you. Walton: I did as you asked. Here is the one you seek. (speaking in foreign language) What do you want? Break the spell and release his soul. I can't! I suggest you try. If you fail, his cruelty knows no bounds. Professor Walton, please, help me! I'm sorry, Naihla. There's nothing I can do. (gasping) (growls) What good is your magic and ancient spells now, Professor? Don't despair, my king, we shall find the one who will undo the spell! (speaking in foreign language) No! My lord, don't listen to her! She sets a trap to ensnare you! You, lying little bitch! (Userkare growls) That was a good try, my dear! Unfortunately, not good enough. (speaking in foreign language) (groaning) (screaming) (hissing) (gunshots) Victor! Naihla: Victor! Naihla? Victor! Naihla, I'm over here! - Victor! - Naihla, I'm over here. Oh, my God, Victor! Help me break these chains! - No, get back! - What? Where did you get that? I said get back! I'm so sorry. Look at me. I'm so, so sorry. - Are you OK? - Yes. OK. It's gonna be OK, but we've gotta get out of here now. Go! Victor: Holy shit! Come on, Victor, we have to get out of here! (gunshots) (Userkare growls) (coughing, struggling) (whimpering) (speaking in foreign language) No! Victor! Naihla, run! (blade cuts through air) (screams) (cries) (whimpers) (Naihla hyperventilating) (strained groans) (speaking in foreign language) (both growling) What the fuck? Oh, my God! Victor! (growls) (growls) (grunting) (growling) Victor, you have to try and get up, OK. I'm right here. Let's try, OK? - Let's go. One, two, three! - (groans) Victor. It's OK, just breathe. Just breathe, OK? Take deep breaths, OK? (growls triumphantly) Victor, please, don't let go of me! Victor! Monster: Motherfucker! (beating) No. No. No, no! You made this happen! Monster: You did this! Now I am trapped in this body. No, no, no, please don't do-- You'll like this face. Just remember, he did this to you! (Naihla struggles) Naihla: No! Please! Carter! (screams) Naihla: Victor, come here! Victor! I don't want you to die. I came back for you. Stay with me, Victor. It's OK. Help is gonna come. You're gonna have one hell of a story. Is that so? Don't talk, don't talk. (chokes) (splutters) What? Jacket. Second pocket. No one must know. You have to promise me you'll destroy... I promise. I promise. It's OK. I love you, Naihla. And I love you too, Victor. - (exhales) - Victor. Victor! (crying) Victor! Victor! (crying) Victor! (splashing) (slow music playing) Victor's voice: The subject is aggressive. He's only displaying primitive and animalistic behavior. - I guess a transplant... Monster: Water... What did you say? (tape rewinding) Tuesday January 14th 2013. My name is Victor Frankenstein and I'm about to embark on a journey of discovery that will change the world forever.
