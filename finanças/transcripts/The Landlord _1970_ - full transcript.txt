This neighborhood's going to be very chic. Let's hope this influx of the beautiful people is the beginning of an inclination, huh? What the hell is that? What is that? Eviction powder. Eviction powder? What's eviction powder? Oh, it's nothing, Mr. Enders. Just a little voodoo. Ha ha ha! Only $25, man! You're lying! You're lying, man!

If you're a landlord, how come you ain't got no door keys? I have door keys. You know, you look like a rapist to me. You got funny eyes. That's ridiculous. If you're figuring on carrying out a sexual attack on me, you better learn the karate boogaloo 'cause we gonna tangle ass right here in this hall. Tam the new landlord, and you're disregarding your lease by practicing whatever you're practicing here with these readings. I'll have you thrown out. If you want to shoot, go ahead and shoot. That'll be running an illegal business, nonpayment of rent, and manslaughter. Little thing like you, 2 landlord? Yeah. Let's see how much back rent you owe, all right? Is that you right there? Huh? Two months back rent You owe me. All here in this book. You look like you could use some food. Come on, landlord. Let's eat. Old Duboise upstairs, always up in my face, talking about being some college president. College president? Wouldn't sweep the hall if his life depended on it. College president. Sure. Some college across town, I never heard of no college selling degrees for $50. Then there's the unearthly Cumbersons. Unearthly? Yeah, They've been here about 25 years. Ain't nobody seen them but twice. How's that for being ominous? Uh, that's, uh... That's impossible. It would be if they were alive. Alive? Oh, they is. I hear 'em rollin' around downstairs. Listen, you should've been here this morning for the tenants association rent strike. What rent strike? Don't worry. It won't happen. Wait. Are you sure? How they gonna get 2 rent strike? Ain't nobody paid rent long as I can remember. Of course, um. There could be 2 back rent strike. But you wouldn't get that, either. That would go to Mr. Lipschultz. That's the old landlord, Nobody ever paid him any rent? Poor soul. Lord knows who'll get it now that he's passed away. He passed away? Rat. Big as a dog. Chased him in the broom closet. Nobody ever go in the broom closet. I think he was in there about three months. How do you Ofays find your way into owning these rat traps? What do you do, give them as bar mitzvah presents? Gotta have more gun control. You want some more eggs? Marge, would you mind putting that gun away? Don't worry. You came my way so I could protect you, though I know you'll only repay me with suffering. Don't say that. Hey, Marge! Marge, have you seen some white man prowling around here... You. It was you. It was me? Don't deny it, degenerate. You gave my little Walter gee money. Now he's sick on cigarettes. I found him sick down in the cellar chain-smoking, so I know some child molester gave him money. Why do you let him smoke? You must know he could get cancer. I'm busy frying hair all day. I can't watch everything he does. What? You're frying hair in this building? I don't have a license for frying hair. He ain't got no license for frying hair. Find your own neighborhood and do hair... queenie. I'm not a hairdresser. You better believe it. Fanny. He's the new landlord. That's right. The new landlord. The new landlord. Oh, lord, ain't this a shame? Matter of fact, I'm glad we met. Your name is, uh.. Mrs. Copee. Right. My husband's been ill. Mrs. Copee... He has this nervous condition, He has headaches, too. The doctor said he should have his own room. Four months' back rent. Is that possible? Oh, anything's possible, sugar. Anyway, we took him to the wills eye hospital because he's got this twitch, but it wasn't his eyes. What was it? It was his nerves. That's, uh... That's understandable, Mrs. Copee. It is? Look, why don't we go down to my place 50 we can discuss this at length? If you wish. Promise me you won't smoke anymore. I promise. What's that? Uh, bye. I think, uh... Walter gee! Walter gee, you come back here. Hey, Duboise, what's happening? Hello, Fanny. Copee in trouble with the pigs again? This ain't no pig this time, sugar. This is the new landlord. Landlord... Professor Duboise. Professor Duboise, how do you do? 1 swear, he thinks the lord put white people con this earth as a punishment. Of course, I don't hold with no sacrilegious talk like that. Mm-hmm.

The roof leaks, the toilet runs all day, and you awful cute to be a landlord. You said the, uh... The roof, uh... runs, and the toilet... Toilet leaks. Mmm. If you didn't sweat so much, nobody'd take you for a landlord. You could pass for a human being. That's not a very nice thing to say, Mrs. Copee, because I intend to be a good landlord as long as you're here. What you mean, as long as I'm here? Who's that you got there with you? Oh, it's the new landlord. That's my husband. Ah. Now, uh... About the rent, Mrs. Copee, are you... Landlord... These arrows have been dipped in Fanny's barbecue sauce 50 as to make death slow... And more agonizing to its unfortunate victim. Landlord, you have until the count of three to vacate these premises. 1... 2... 3! You son of a bitch. You make one more crack about my spareribs, and I'll bust your head. Oh, you shut up. I thought I told you about putting your drum in the living room. Oh, mother... I'm sorry. It's my only chance. 1 got Italian class after this. Then your father... Oh, God. Keep talking. 1 hear you. From the top. 1.2.. About my house, mother. What house, dear? I'm in love with this house. 1,2.. 3,4,56. Don't do that, dear. You're throwing me off. I'm just trying to help you. I've invested in real estate. You have invested in real estate? Oscar. Oscar. Yes.

The 15th of July. Son of a bitch. When was [ born? Mother! Foul-mouth. Little foul-mouth. Mother, don't do that. You have 15 minutes. Then it's my Italian class, which I'm not giving up to argue with you about dates. You see that, my darling pussycat? What you did is bad. There's an iron curtain in this house, mother. Will you tell me what you're talking about? I'm talking about doing what [ want to do. Do it... out there in the guest house. I can't do it out in the guest house. The way you look at me when I bare my guts, you think I'm off my rocker. 1 don't think any such modem thing. Why don't you take up the banjo, write folk songs... Something you can do in your room? Get a bath. Get yourself together. And wash everywhere. Oh, your sister's invited Peter Cootes for dinner. Your brother and his wife... What's her name? They're coming in from Westport. Peter who? Peter Cootes. You know Peter Cootes. Oh. The Peter Cootes. Of course. Don't get smart. Get dressed, huh? And comb your hair. Al right? Yeah, Bird! I just want to say, Elgar, that I'm proud of you. I'm glad you're my brother and not somebody else's. Well, it's a great house. I think somebody's got to begin to integrate. I can't. I don't have the stomach for it. But to think... That 1 have a really forward-looking, devil-may-care revolutionary for my brother makes me feel right in the swing of things. 1 just hope you don't get shot. Susan, God. Have your people planned any rallies or marches or anything like that? Bird! Elgar, would you do me a fantastic favor? Whatever you do, don't talk about spades to poor Peter. What do you mean? With the napalm and all that, he's very sensitive about the new left. And, Elgar... What? I love him, Bird! Elgar! My God, what are you two burning up here? What is that? Uh... my socks caught on fire. Your socks caught on fire. Well, put them out and get downstairs, the both of you. Peter's getting bored. Taste good? God, I'd love a little den somewhere. Susan, dear, you cannot go on falling down the stairs like this. Tell me a proper way to fall down the stairs, I'll try to do it. Susu, you really must get a checkup. This could be a case of lack of coordination. Maybe it's cerebral palsy. Could be you're smoking too much. Young man, I'll not have you talking against the tobacco industry in this house. Have you bought into tobacco, Mr. Enders? Mr. Cootes... In some circles, you might say 1 am tobacco. That's really cool, Mr, Enders. Uh, we're napalm. Is that all? No. We're, uh... Insecticide and deodorant and, uh... Mom. Mom. Susu. Dad. Susu. Dad. Sorry we're late, gang, but the traffic... Ch, God, the traffic... Peter, I'd like you to meet my son. Susu talks of no one else.

Elgar, did you hear that? I'm not deaf, dad. Elgar, answer your father. Did you hear? Yeah, I heard him. What are you up to, Elgar? Elgar's bought some real estate, haven't you, Elgar? Susan. Where is this real estate, Elgar? The park slope area, William Jr. It's 2 miles south of the Dodd-Sears townhouse on Concord street. Susan, take the clip out of your hair. 2 miles south... Park slope. Park slope? Good God. Elgar, are you aware that, uh... That's a colored neighborhood? Colored neighborhood. I'm three doors from mom's chitlin 'n' rib joint. Oh, Elgar. We will not discuss the revolting aspects of your business venture, if you don't mind. What's it all about, folks? Well, Peter, um... You might as well hear, since you're likely to marry my sister, if she hasn't told you already. Told me what? Elgar, don't you dare. We can't keep it secret all our lives. You want to hear the truth, It involves you and Susan. What are you talking about? Peter, actually, uh... Our whole family... Mom, Susu, dad, William Jr., and grandfather here... We are all.. Octoroons. What an ugly thing to say. I'm offended. Octoroon? Heywood and Edith are our poor dark relations. Elgar! Would you please explain your conduct at this table tonight? Darling, come on, apologize. He makes napalm and deodorant. And insecticide, You lazy, no-good liberal. Shall 1 serve the fish... What? Oh. Yes, bring in the fish... please. Let me tell you something, Mr. Lincoln. If you march into this house with an armful of pickaninnies, the best you can expect from me will be a swift kick in the ass! Mr. Enders, you forgot to finish your soup. Uh! I'm just too upset, Edith. Edith, bring in some of that wonderful trout of yours, please. I think that'll help everything. Thank you. Lord, Mr. Elgar, you sure love Edith's cold potato soup. You want some more, sir? That's the last straw! That's all right, folks. There's plenty more soup in the kitchen if anybody wants any. Elgar, get out of this room! Go! Do you know what NAACP means? No, Elgar. What does it mean? It means, "niggers ain't always colored people." What does he mean by that? He called us niggers. Us? Heywood. Knock it off. Rita, I just want to talk to you. No. Ne, [ don't. I just want to... Rite? 1 want to talk... Sally, the thing that amazes me the most is that my parents don't understand that they are totally, totally antichristian. Please, Elgar, I'm sorry. I don't have time to talk to you. It's not like I come around with my problems... 1 have to make festoons for the "worthy causes' ball. 1 just want to come in for a few minutes. Let me come in for a few minutes. Who's that? He's, um.

Hey, landlord! Hey! How are you? I just thought I'd come by and see your house. Now, in here, I'm going to rip all this out here, see, straight through to the skylight. In that area, I'll hang a big chandelier. Right. And here I'm going to put a patio. Don't step on this stuff. Lots of used brick and maybe some tubs of flowers along the wall here. And then... Right here in this corner, I thought it'd be wild if we had some kind of fantastic sculpture. That'd be very nice. Or maybe a birdbath. A birdbath, Guess what? What? They're having a rent party for me tonight. Can you come? I can't. I'll be dancing tonight. Oh, God. I'm late for the dentist. I got to go.

To get rid of this mole. Because everybody that doesn't have moles... Got you to believe it's real ugly. So you'd do anything. You'd hide your face. Anything... Walk in backwards... You'd do everything. Anything. Then one day... One day... One day... Moles are in. Moles are in. People are getting out their eyebrow pencil... Marking them on, and you've got one... Naturally... Right in the middle of your forehead. You'll know what pride is for the first time. For the first time. You whiteys screaming about miscegenation...

How come he's in jail? Huh? How come Copee's in jail? Oh, he had another demonstration today. Seems like they're putting everybody in jail nowadays. Hmm? I said it seems like everybody's going to jail nowadays, especially Copee. When did it happen? This morning. I don't know. It all just seems so strange to me. I look at Copee sometimes, and I wonder... How did we get ourselves into this? Well, I was miss sepia, 1957. What's that? Well, that's like miss America or miss New York... Except in color. There's my trophy over there, What, this? Uh-huh. Francine Marie Johnson, miss sepia, 1957. Ha. My mother had it made into a lamp for me for Christmas. I liked it better when it was a cup. Ha ha ha. But anyway, as 1 was saying, it sure has been hard on me since Copee turned black. Turned black? Yeah. He was Sioux Indian for two years. And little Walter gee... He gets so confused. He doesn't know what to think. You know, I thought... I thought about going to Chicago. Maybe California. Go into the movies or... Go on TV or something. I'm sure tired of doing heads. Do you think I look good enough to be on TV? I think you look fantastic. Yeah, well, you wouldn't know it by Copee. He thinks 1 should be blacker, That's ridiculous. Why is that ridiculous? Because you're beautiful. It's just the red light. Ohh... What's the matter? Oh, wait a second. Oh, God. My head's killing me. You feel anything? Well, you haven't got a fever. What you got there? Excedrin.

Elgar... This doesn't mean anything. Because I love Copee. Lanie! Hi. Come on in. I just don't understand your sudden interest in those kind of people, dear. I mean, we're all liberals, but... Open hybridization... I'm their landlord till they get relocated. Well, I don't understand. Red ball! Oh, I think there's something that you should know, mother. What's that, dear? I think I love a girl who's a negro. Elgar, let's go for a little drive. I want to talk to you. Uh, daddy... Yes? We're going for a drive. Something's come up. Elgar, a lot of these people... Not all... There's good black people as well as good white people. I've always taught you that. But some live to set traps for rich white women. I'm not a rich white woman, mother. I know that, dear. I didn't mean that. You know 1 didn't mean that. Didn't we all go together to see Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? Yeah, It's just, Elgar, you have to realize all Negroes are not like that. You sound like a segregationist. I think you have a castration complex. You have a castration complex. 1 can't have one. It isn't physically possible. A castration complex is one of the crosses a liberated female must bear! You think I'm a liberator, dear? Joyce, you are a liberated, aggressive, butch American broad. Doesn't mean I don't love you. What does it mean, dear? It means I'm going to do what I want with my damn life. So... You're going to marry 2 Negress. Ha ha. You'll be happy to hear she's very light. Son, do me a favor. Make sure. Oh, mother. 1 don't care. Don't you understand? Why don't you come down to my house and help me plan what to do? Me, your castrated mother? What could I possibly do to help? Just help me plan it. You can pick out the drapes, uh, wallpaper, stuff like that. Huh? Huh? You only have to ask, dear. That's all you've ever had to do. And don't worry about that girl, dear. If she's putting you on, she's most likely only Jewish. Heywood, I shouldn't be long. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Go on, go on! If you're from the police, they got him already. Uh... 1 beg your pardon? I'm Mrs, Enders. Oh, The landlord's wife? Ha ha ha. Well, thank you very much. I'm his mother. Oh! Ha ha. 1 didn't get your name. Marge. Just call me Marge. Marge.
