(dramatic music) (bell ringing) (soft music) (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) (pulsating drum beat) (soft music) - [Receptionist] Miranda and Cassidy, we're ready for you. (soft music) - Hi. - Hi. - [Nancy] Hi, girls nice to see you. This is Mitchell from the network. - Hey, guys, let's take this for a spin, okay. So, Miranda, your character is kind of a hipster but sort of brainy but still sexy and approachable. Cassidy, you're reading the landlord whenever you're ready. - I'm sorry one second. I thought I was reading Hannah? - [Nancy] Did they give you the wrong sides? - No, it just says mid 30s. No, never mind. It's totally fine just give me one second to look it over. - Just gonna be a minute. - Yeah, I know. - Okay, got it cool. - [Nancy] Okay, perfect whenever you're ready. Slate first. - [Miranda] Hi, I'm Miranda DeLonge. - Hi, I'm Cassidy Harper. (soft music) - [Valerie] Fired, for what? - Look I need to talk to you about something. - [Valerie] Okay. - I need to borrow $1400. - Are you bananas? - [Cassidy] They're gonna kick me out of the apartment if I don't pay the back rent. - I thought you were gonna get a roommate. - I interviewed Craigslist people. One of them had a tarantula. - Isn't Ray's name still on that lease? - I have not talked to Ray in months. - Well, I don't have it. - Okay, well, then do you have some boxes cause I'm gonna need to sleep under a bridge, and I hear if you make a mattress out of them that keeps you from getting frostbite. - Do you think I have some secret vault someplace? - [Cassidy] You know I will pay you back. - Oh, I know for a fact that you won't. How are you gonna pay for next month's rent. I think that you should come and live with me until you can save up some money. - [Cassidy] No, absolutely not. - Alright, alright there's a liquor store across the street I'm sure they have some boxes. - Why are you being so awful to me? An artist's life is like this sometimes, mom. - Do you think I'm so fulfilled working in a perfume counter? By four o'clock my right eye is twitching. You know what's gonna happen to you. You're gonna end of marrying the first hairy slob who comes along who can pay your bills. Is that what you wanna be, somebody's concubine. - You know what forget it. I'm sorry I bothered you. Fine. But just until I get my shit together. Can I have a little cash just for now just for walking around money. - You're welcome. - Are you going out? - [Valerie] Yes, he'll be here any minute. - Who? - [Valerie] A guy I've been seeing. I met him at the gym. - I thought you went to Curves? - I switched. It smelled like soup, all right. No cigarettes. - You are too trusting. You don't know this guy. What if he's another Dan Danielson. - (giggling) The guy with the parrot? He was okay. I can't believe you remember him. - That bird was aggressive. Just please will you stay in well lighted areas? (telephone ringing) - Hello. Okay, tell him I'll be right down. There is a low fat stir fry in the freezer. Listen just I want you to stay here, and I want you to think about I want you to think about your future, okay? Does this look okay? - [Cassidy] Yes, you look hot. - Okay, okay. Alright don't wait up. - [Cassidy] Ugh, gross. (soft music) - Hey, I didn't think you'd still be here. - I fell asleep. - (giggling) Yeah, I can see that. Feeling better? - I feel wretched. How was your date? - It was nice. I actually have some good news for you. - Am I getting a new daddy? - The man I was out with he has a business, and he's hiring so. - Oh, dear lord. - Oh, come on, Cassie, it's a job. - What does he do? - He's in the diamond business. - I don't wanna be a saleslady. I don't know anything about jewelry. - You are so ungrateful forget the card. - No, no, no I'll go. I'm sorry thank you I appreciate it. - You should go home. Get some sleep. You look terrible. (dramatic music) - [Anthony] Hey. - [Alex] Hey. - Hey, ha, what? Don't you (dramatic music) - Alright, man, come on. - Shut up, shut up. - Okay guys, guys, guys. I'm gonna get. - I'm gonna get. Guys, guys, guys, I'm gonna get. I'm gonna get. - Sit down. See you're running, but I know where you work. Alright so why waste all of that effort tell me? - I don't know. I freaked out. - Well, I'm gonna assume that if you had my money this little track meet wouldn't have happened. - Look I need like three days, okay, okay. - Listen when I agreed to loan you this money I explained to you, you were actually borrowing it from my employer. Now I assumed you were familiar with his reputation. - Please explain to Lil Pop that I-- - No, no one needs to explain anything to Pop. Someone needs to explain to you that our repayment schedule is inflexible. Ask your friend Hiram how Pop feels about excuses. - Hiram Gladstone? The zoo thing? Pop was the one that tied him up to a wolf habitat? - Well, do you like animals, huh? I'm adding two points a week. - Come on. - Yes. I don't appreciate being made to run in these clothes. - Fuck. (dramatic music) - [Barry] No hurry just come in whenever you feel like it. - We open yet? God forbid what'd you have to answer the phone or something I'd never forgive myself. (soft knocking) We open at 10. - Hi, hi, I'm looking for Barry. - What can I do for you? - I'm supposed to hopefully start working here today. - Right, sorry. Hi. - Hi. - Sorry, come in. - Cassidy. - Alex. - I'm supposed to ask for Barry. - Yeah, that's my father. He'll be out here in a minute to act weird and make you feel uncomfortable. How much do you know about the job? - I know that this is your address and that I was supposed to be here at 10. I'm early that's good, right? - Yeah. Well, it's not complicated. Basically we have to take these stones, and we get them to other shops in the neighborhood as discretely as possible. We used to use a big security firm, but they kept getting robbed. It was actually gangs of Columbians who specialize in it, so now we do what they did 50 years ago. We hire a pretty girl that no one would suspect, and she just puts them in her pocket and takes them where they need to go. - Well, that sounds dangerous. - It's not. - Well, what happens if I get robbed? - Well, you just give it to them right away. Don't fight we have insurance. - How do you know you can trust me? - I don't, but we have insurance. - Hey, you must be Val's daughter. - [Cassidy] Cassidy. - You're gonna be great. What a beautiful girl you are. - Why thank you. You know, you have an amazing voice. Have you ever considered trying to do voiceover work. It's actually very lucrative. - Thanks but I have enough disappointment in my life already. One thing you can't dress like that. - Like what? - You look like Stevie Nicks and everything but that's not what I want. Jeans, simple. - Okay, got it. - It's easy misdirection like the magician at a kid's birthday party. Get them to look at the little birdie up here take their wallet with the other hand. - I should mention I'm gonna need to leave from time to time for auditions. I'm sort of in demand right now. There's actually a cop show that I'm up for, but I'll keep you both in the loop. - I'm sure we can figure it out. What about the insurance company? - I left a letter on your desktop. - [Barry] There's no letter on my desk. - On your computer desktop. - We keep having this conversation. Efficiency every dollar you waste adds another day until I retire. Do good tell your mom I said hi. - He seems okay. - Yeah, he's a doll. Anyway when you're not schlepping around, you can be here helping us with doing filing stuff. I actually have a delivery for you right now if you're up for it. Yeah, you'll be going to Hatoum, which is 224 South Wabash. So just put this in your pocket just be cool. - That's it. - Yeah, we already had you bonded. Just sign here. - [Cassidy] What happened to the last girl that did this job? - She was killed in a robbery. (Alex laughing) - What's in the envelope? - [Alex] Two diamonds. - Worth how much? - About 23,5. - Shit. - Why don't you come right back here afterwards I have another delivery for you. - Okay, here I go wish me luck. - Vaya con dios. (soft music) - I like your earrings. Is that tourmaline? - Sorry me no English. - [Valerie] Here, here, here, here you go. - [Customer] Thank you. - [Valerie] Okay, bye. - Yeah, that's really it. I just bring the stuff to the other stores in the area. When there's no deliveries, do a little computer stuff. Easy peasy Japanesey. - Well, try to pick up a few things. You know learning a trade that could be really great for you. - I have a trade thank you. Gross look at this picture that Tanya just posted to Instagram. It's actually sad. - Is that the Quantum Leap guy? - Uh-huh. - Man, she's really doing great, huh? - [Cassidy] Please she did like one commercial. - Well, it's a start. - I'm actually thinking of going back out there myself. It'll be different this time. I'm in a much better place emotionally. - You really wanna subject yourself to another Best Defense. - One time eight years ago we are still having this conversation. - Well, it's a legitimate question. Alright we can talk about something else fine. - So you and Barry are you like serious? - I don't know. We've only been on a few days, but I like him. Yeah, he's funny, and he listens to me, he does. You know he's not just waiting until the next time he has to talk, and he's old fashioned. He always grabs for the check. - I thought a modern woman should always pay her own way? - No, it's to emasculating that way. Yeah, it makes it hard for him to be the aggressor. - Oh, god, mom, please stop. - You know sometimes it would be nice to get a little support from you for once. - You're right. Tell me about his dick is it thick? - What? - Veiny. - What get that out of your mouth. - Come on, Valerie, can we please get the fingerprints on the glass? It looks like somebody's been eating ribs over here. - Sure, Wendy. - Dude, you gotta get out of here. - No, I am not starting from the bottom again. I've got nine years till social security. If I don't die from inhaling Shalimar, I'll be fine. (soft music) (soft music) - Here's the stuff from Meyer, and I already filed the stuff from Algonquin. - You've got this down. - Well, I did go to college. - What'd you study? - Theater. - [Alex] I don't think that counts. - The fruits of your labor. - Thank you. Barry, Barry, are you sure this is right? - What did you think it was gonna be? - Well, we never actually talked about-- - Well, now you know see you tomorrow. - Sorry. - This is pitiful. How am I supposed - Saving for something important? (Cassidy stammering) - Hey, will you teach me something about I don't know this stuff? - What do you wanna know? - I don't know. Show me the difference between diamonds. - Okay. Come over here. Stay here. (Cassidy sighing) - Fucking FICA. - Now each part of the diamond has a name. The top half is called the crown, the bottom is the pavilion, the point at the bottom is the culet, and then the flat part on top is called the table. - [Cassidy] How much is this one worth? - This is a five caret diamond ideal cut, hearts and arrows, GS-1 color retails around 180. - Dude, seriously you guys have that much money? - It's all credit. We get stones in on memo. We sell what we can, and we return the rest. If my dad could liquidate and retire believe me he would. - I gotta say it just looks like all the other ones. Maybe a little bigger. - No, it has no inclusions. Those are the little flaws that interfere with the light that passes through the diamond. - I don't approve of that kind of perfectionism. I think flaws should be embraced. - Yeah. - If I ever get engaged, I hope my fiance gives me a ring that's all flaws. - Well, as long as he buys it from me. I should put this back. Would you mind getting that? (loud knocking) - Why Butch Cassidy Harper, as I live and breathe. - What are you doing here, Ray? - I'm interested in some expensive and vulgar jewelry. - [Alex] Hey, hey, hey is everything okay? - Who the fuck is this then? - That's my boss. - Who the fuck am I, man. Who the fuck are you? - Look at this a tough guy. That bat better have a little gun in it. - Ray, you need to go. - No, no, no let him stay. I pushed the button for the alarm. The cops will be here any minute. They'd love to kick the shit out of him. - Ray, I work here. Why would you come here? How did you find me? - I don't know I saw you walking downtown this afternoon. I sort of followed you. - What the fuck, Ray? Do I need to get a restraining order? - No, of course not I would... Fuck. Sorry, Cass, really. I'm sorry I just wanna talk is all. Will you call me? - Go. - Okay, sorry, sorry, boss man not her fault. I'm an idiot. - She said go. - Okay, sorry, Cass. Sorry, Cass. Please call there's some stuff I need to say, okay. Okay, I'm leaving. It was good to see you. - I am so sorry. - [Alex] Not your fault. - I don't need my radioactive life contaminating your office goddamn him. - Look it's okay. Really, really it's no big deal. How about we go get dinner. I'm starving come on I'm buying. - You don't need to do that. - No, I want to. I'm gonna go get my coat don't move. Stay here. (Cassidy sighing) Believe me I'm not hanging around here waiting to take over the family business. Forgive me but I'm aiming for something higher than that. I've got a couple things going on right now. - Yeah.- Yeah. Some businesses I'm trying to start up. I'm actually working on something huge actually. I wanna tell you about it, but you can't talk about it especially with my dad and your mom too I guess. - No, of course. - I was in the Caribbean last year, and I went to this island called Dominica. They make this incredible rum there like insanely delicious. The legend is, is that it even helps men, you know - Get raging boners. - Basically. - Does it work? - Yes. - Liquor and boners sound like the kind of thing old white dudes would be really into. - I know right. - Can you get the Eagles in there somehow? - Look if this thing takes off, I could be sitting on a giant pile of money like a fucking fortune. - Okay, but - But customs seized it at the airport because the secret ingredient wasn't exactly legal. So I've got 80 cases sitting in a Homeland Security warehouse at O'Hare. - [Cassidy] Oops. - Yeah. I talked to a lawyer who says he could help but he wants 15,000 up front as a retainer, and then like another 80K to get it approved. Every dollar I could borrow went to buying this shit. I need more than just taking a little bit out of each pay check. I need a score. - Oh, a score. You're gonna knock over a 7-11 or something? - I wanna talk to you about something, and I want you to know that you can say no and I'm not gonna get mad or fire you or anything. But I have a way that we could make some serious money. But it's shady. - I'm not necessarily opposed to shady. - So let's say you're making a delivery, and let's say you get robbed. Well, the insurance company pays out the loss, and the business doesn't get hurt. - Okay. - But let's say when you get robbed instead of giving the robber the stones you were carrying you give him some dummy package. He thinks he's getting the stones, but he's actually getting fakes. - And I keep the real ones. - That's right, and then I sell them and we split the money. - Couldn't we just say I got robbed and do the same thing? - These insurance people they don't fuck around. It has to be real. We need a police report, hopefully an eyewitness. If you get caught defrauding an insurance company, it's no joke. I'm talking orange jump suit time. You don't get to play tennis in Wisconsin. But if the robbery is real, then nobody is defrauding anyone. The robber just gets something that isn't valuable, and the insurance company pays out such a small amount that it's just like a blip on their radar. It's virtually a victimless crime. Thanks. Here's the thing though I need you to get robbed. I mean I could hire somebody to do it, but then we would have to cut him in. Plus he could get picked up for somebody else and then he could rat me out. We gotta minimize our risk. - Couldn't I just be super obvious when I'm making my deliveries or something? - That would take too long. It's gotta be somebody who knows what you do for a living, is a little sketchy, and would maybe break the law to make some extra money. - Oh, my god Ray. - How much of a dirt bag is he? - No, no, no, no he wouldn't do it. - Why what does he do? - He's a pretty unsuccessful drug dealer. - I can see why he wouldn't wanna mess with that. - He likes me. He's not gonna rob me. - How hard can it be for a professional actress to convince a drug dealer to do somebody immoral? (Alex and Cassidy laughing) I like that. - I gotta say you don't look much like a Handleman. - Well, truth be told I'm not. My dad changed our name when he got into the business so people would take him more seriously. We used to be the Campbells. - Seriously? - Yep. - How could you let him do that? - I was like two they didn't consult me. - This is Oh, my god, oh my god this is totally gonna work. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna make it happen. I'll call Ray in the morning. Maybe I try to make him think that if he had money I'd take him back. I'm not even sure that's a lie to tell you the truth. - Will that work? - Ray's a fuck up, but he loves me and apparently I am a terrible person. - I don't think we should do this. Just not right now, okay. I just think we need to keep our heads on straight keep clear headed right now, okay. I'm not saying no at all just just not now, okay. - Yeah, totally. Thank you for dinner. - Yeah. Bye. Dammit. Hey, I'll be there in 20 minutes. How much do you have? This is a fake. Chain is brass, this is glass. Real, ish. - What do you mean "ish"? - That there's a ton of flaws. Actually it's a really shitty diamond. - Thank you, thank you. I know what the word flaws means. How much? - 400. - No. Let's do 800 unless you'd rather go down to the Tip Top and talk to Lil Pop directly. - You take all the cash and just give it to him. You don't put any in your pocket? - What happens on my end is none of your fucking business. - Look how long we've been doing this? You and I we make decent walking around money out of this arrangement or it doesn't work. Don't be greedy. I'll give you 550, but that's it. - Damn, what they say about your people is true. - That we're excellent dancers. - (laughing) No, that's farfetched. - Okay, 1650 including the bracelet? - Yep. - It's 10:30. - [Anthony] Alright thank you. One of you go get the car, please. - They got a bathroom I can use? - [Anthony] No, hold it. - [Malik] Come on man be a fucking pro. - There's a bathroom right down the hall. - I'm teaching them a lesson in self-control. - This is 2600. - I must have contracted some exotic parasite that affects my hearing. - Look I can't buy all this stuff and pay you, and but if you give me until Friday, I can do both. - Alex, look you realize you're only paying the points. You're even touching the principal. - Spare me the economics lesson, okay. - You stupid little, bitch. (Alex gasping) You know, you have some terrible manners for somebody asking for a favor. Alright see now I have to go to Pop and ask him to be patient because you're a spendthrift motherfucker. Dude, you are setting yourself up for a conversation with a person with a more limited vocabulary than mine. - So, I run back inside and grab a box like a shoe box and put a T-shirt in the bottom of it and come back outside and gently lift this little guy up and put him in the box. I should remind you that I'm fucking terrified of birds like Tippi Hedren level stressed. - Yeah, I remember when that pigeon chased you off the bench (laughing). - Anyway, so I gently lift this little guy up and put him in the box and he is so small. I mean he weighed like nothing, like colored air. Then I have this swell of love like a father's love for it. (Cassidy laughing) So I lift the little guy up, and I put him in the box. I bring the box inside and put the box by the window with the sun shining on it, try to warm him up a bit. I'm feeling like Saint Francis all heroic. I look up the number for animal control I think it's called. I tell them I've got an injured bird that flew into my window and of course Yes, you can have that. Of course they think I've gone gorilla tits and they tell me there's nothing they can do about it. Just make sure he's in a safe place, and he'll either get better or he won't which means, yeah, of course. So I go back inside and go over to the window, and the box is empty. What the fuck? That's when I hear this noise like this this like low growling noise like (growling). I forgot Joe has a cat Mortimer. Manky little thing stays under the bed all day. Swear I've seen him twice since I moved in, and Mortimer is batting this poor little bird around the apartment like - Oh, god. - Jimmy fucking Conners whack, whack, whack. So I run over to get the cat off of him, and trip on Joe's poncey fucking skateboard and bang my arm on the radiator. Now that's how I did it. Fractured wrist. - Poor buddy. - He was pretty badly hurt to begin with. I probably just hastened his demise. - I meant you, dummy. - Yeah, well, patron saint of last causes. - Long shots. - You know that thing's been expunged from my record now. - Come on, man. - Get of me. Fucker, don't you put your hands on her again. Apparently he got his vision back in that eye, so that's a bonus. Yeah, 60 hours of anger management it actually helped. Apparently my anger is borne out of frustration. - What about art? - [Ray] I've made some stuff. - Yeah. - Working mostly construction almost full time making decent coin for once. In fact, your eggs are on me. - I actually got it covered. I have a new job too as you know. - Yeah, sorry about that. What do you do there anyway? - Can you keep a secret? - [Ray] No. - Well, then I'm not gonna tell you. - My hand to God. - Alright I am a runner for a diamond importer. - No way. What exactly is that? - Well, I basically walk around downtown by myself delivering diamonds. - You're kidding no security. Do you carry a pistol? - Just me and my wiles. Anyway they're insured out the waz. First sign of danger I'm supposed to drop the stuff quick. - Jesus. - I don't know I feel like I should get a friend to stage a robbery keep the diamonds for myself. God knows I could use the money. A little financial stability would solve like 98% of my problems. - Well, if you get caught I know three shitty lawyers and an excellent bail bondsman. - You're late. - I'm early it's eight minutes till. - [Barry] Are you sure? Am I fast? - [Cassidy] This thing gets its time from space so. What do you got for me today? - Three this morning I don't know about this afternoon. - Okay, I'm gonna need to take an early lunch. I have a 11:30 audition. - I'm sorry these hours too taxing for you? Should I have another courier standing by on salary in case you have scheduling problems? - [Alex] What's the matter? - I have a audition, a really big one. - What do you care? - Well, just tell me how it's gonna work now that we're in second position to the young lady's dreams? Are you gonna be schlepping stones again? Am I gonna be doing this and running around like a vilde chaya? If our creditors show up today, I'd be in an audition of my own at the bottom of the Chicago river. - It's her lunch hour. What are we running a plantation here? Go. - Big shot. - Thank you. Here you are you're going here first 722 State Street 12 floor. Hey, come here. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. So how'd it go did you talk to him? - Yeah, I just had breakfast with him. I laid the foundation. - Just the foundation? - Well, it's in motion I can't over sell it. - Okay, take this. - What's this? - It's the dummy stones. It's called moissanite. It's really hard to tell the difference even for a pro. - Well, what am I supposed to do with it? - Keep it in your pocket at all times always every delivery. When he finally decides to take the bait or had somebody else do it our whatever, then you give him this one and you swallow the real one. - Swallow it? - I'm kidding. Sorry. Anyway just keep it on you in different pockets. - I don't need it yet. - No, I want you to get in the habit. You never know when it's gonna come, okay. Let's practice. Stick them up. I'm serious stick them up. Give me the stones. - Okay, okay, okay. - That's the real one. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. Look from now on always keep the real one in your right pocket. - Okay, sorry. - We're not gonna have multiple shots at this. Get your head in the game, okay. Sorry I'm being a little harsh. - Okay. - Okay, let's get out. I don't want him to suspect anything let's go. (soft music) (pulsating drum beat) - No. - That's not it. - Hold on a second we're gonna need more energy than that. Considerably more. - [Gary] Yeah, bring it on. - [Rod] So do it again. - Yep, Anytime you're ready. - And now. - What time did your husband come home that night? - Does she look like a cop? - No, way too hot. - Yeah. - But she looks like she parties. - Yeah, I think she probably does. - You do right? You party a little bit? Yeah. - Sorry. - So let's see some of that. A little of that energy bring it up. - You're among friends. - Yeah. - Do this with energy. - What time did your husband come home that night? - Yeah (sighing) I don't know. - I do. (soft music) ♫ Right now because my pockets are low ♫ You say you really wish I would go ♫ You're living easy and things are fine ♫ But life has got such a strange design ♫ Before you know it there's the end of the line ♫ 'Cause baby things are changing all the time - Yes. Your mother's making me lasagna tonight. You gonna join us for dinner? - No, don't worry I'll be out till at least 11 or 12. - Owe you one. See you in the funny pages. You, I need those tax forms for October by tomorrow. - Yep. So warm, isn't he? What are you up to tonight? - I'm actually going out with Ray. - Nice. You gonna dial it up a bit? - I told you I'm working on it. - You know I have to admit I'm not thrilled about the idea of you going out with him. - Well, it was your idea. - Yeah, well, a lot of my ideas are fucked. - I thought we weren't doing this? (cellphone buzzing) He's downstairs I gotta go. - Have a terrible time. - What is that? - What this hat? I think it belonged to my uncle. - No, dummy, that thing you're leaning against. - Oh, that. That is a finely tuned automobile that I recently acquired. - [Cassidy] Holy shit you bought a car. - In fact I did. Told they call it a Cadillac. - How, where? - That lot on Cicero with the big inflatable eagle. - Low credit, no credit that commercial is so fucking depressing. - And yet their open mindedness about credit histories is everything they said it was. - [Cassidy] How much? - Never get in. - It's comfortable. - Yeah, but I think a fat person used to drive it though. It's a bit lumpy over there. Look I have to admit purchasing this automobile has left me a bit of cash poor at the moment. I intend to show you what an excellent cheap date looks like. - Bring it on. - [Ray] You should probably put you seat belt on. I learned to drive on the other side of the road. (Cassidy laughing) (soft music) - [Cassidy] This place is incredible. - Yeah, isn't it. My old roommate Jeremy had an eel. Came here with him once. - I don't understand the idea of a fish as a pet. It's not enough action for me. - That's you all action. Actress by day, diamond courier by day also. How was work by the way? - Fine. I can't believe they let me walk around with that kind of loot. I did a delivery today of a stone that was worth $55,000. - Really? - Yeah. - Shit. - Yeah, just walking it around in my pocket. Can you imagine what we could do with that kind of money? - [Ray] And there're stories of people getting robbed all the time. - Yeah, it happens all the time apparently, but I'm just supposed to give up everything. Don't fight, don't run. - Jesus. Please be careful. If anything happen to you I'd just... Maybe I could do some body guarding for you pro bono of course. You know just follow you around discourage anyone getting froggy. Or I could just carry you around in a baby bijorn nothing like weird or anything. What's that for? - You're being nice. - [Ray] I'm not sure. (lively music) - You said anything I pick. - I'm coming out. ♫ If you want me ♫ Why don't you come on ♫ And get me honey - This look transitions well from day to evening. ♫ Not another minute baby ♫ If you need me ♫ Come on, come on get me honey ♫ 'Cause I can't hold you ♫ Not another minute baby ♫ If you want me ♫ If you want me ♫ Why don't you come on and get me baby ♫ I can't save it now ♫ I can't save it now ♫ I can't hold it now ♫ If you want me - Oh, god, it was awful. I mean she was so happy when she first got the part. I mean she told everybody. Of course we had this huge going away party. - So what happened? - Well, the last day of shooting she had this giant scene, right I mean big monologue lots of words. She couldn't get out of the make up chair. I mean she just froze, completely paralyzed. - That's awful. - Yeah, and the producers were screaming at her agent and she could hear them. I mean it was a disaster. - Do you have a nine volt battery? - Oh, um. - Thank you. - I also have a light in the bathroom that's too high for me. - Let's do it all. - Okay. Anyway we finally got enough Valium in her to stumble to the set but it was a mess, and then of course I mean when they picked up the series they recast her part. - [Barry] That must have been tremendously difficult. - Oh, god she was devastated. Then she had to come back here, right, and face everybody. You see I think that's why she can't give this whole acting thing up. I mean she's gotta save face, and she's gotta prove to herself that she can do it. Plus I don't think she even knows what else to do. - No, I meant difficult for you seeing your kid in that kind of pain struggling. I had to pull Alex out of little league because it was making me anxious. I threw up in the dug out once. Kept getting struck out, he was a poor fielder. He did get hit by a lot of pitches. - You don't talk about him much. - He hates me. - Oh, he does not. - Yeah, he does. - When his mother died I kind of overcompensated with the tough love thing. My pop was a second rate auto mechanic with a short temper. We didn't talk about feelings much. - You're being hard on yourself. Every parent feels things like this. You know, he knows that you love him. - Either way he's grown, he lived. Now I get to figure out the rest of my life. - So what's on the agenda? - I've got plans. Small plans. - I like plans. - Good. - [Ray] You know I think Joe might move out soon. I know you're real happy on your ma's couch and all. - [Cassidy] Ray. - I know, I know I get excited. (soft music) - It's nice. I don't mean this to be shitty, but it really seems like you've done some growing up in the last couple months. - Thanks. You know I had this counselor at anger management who said, "Start acting like the person you want to be "and soon you'll become that person." But that's terrible advice. I think acting like the person I wanted to be was what made me such a shit head. I trapped myself into believing that I had to be the person that the 18-year old me thought was cool. But it turns out the 18-year old me was an idiot. - You were just trying to be cool. You're an artist. - Yeah, I love making stuff I do. But I think what I wanted more than anything was to be different than normal people somehow. You know to get noticed like, "Ooh, isn't that what's his name over there?" Just need to be busy. Busy's happy. - Yeah, you're right. I care about all that stuff too it's so stupid. - Can I ask you a question? Are you still getting those panicky things? - A lot lately I should get some pills. - Nah, forget that. I mean I know a guy obviously. There's this thing I've been doing when I get mad or punchy whatever. It really helps. I made it up you wanna try it? - Is it gross? - No, shut up god. No, sit Indian style. - Not cool, Paleface. - Christ sit in the style of people from India, okay. Now close your eyes. No laughing, no laughing. This is serious. - I'm sorry, okay, okay, okay. - First, try to be very small like a marble of energy floating around inside your body then shrink to a speck of light. Now here's what I tell myself. You are a tiny germ on a dirty rock spinning at a 1,000 miles an hour and orbiting a star. That star is just one of hundreds of billions in a Milky Way, which itself is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known universe. You do not matter. No one is watching. You are free. - That is the most depressing thing I have ever heard. - No, it's great news you're inconsequential. You can do whatever you want. Think about it in the face of all that nothingness what is there to be worried about? What other people think? Fear and anger are ego problems, but you, you don't not matter. No one is watching, you're free. You do not matter no one is watching. You are free. ♫ You just snapped your finger baby ♫ And I'll did what you wanted me to do - Having trouble with that? ♫ So search your heart ♫ And find some love for me ♫ Don't put me baby ♫ Don't put me baby ♫ Oh, no, no ♫ In misery ♫ Oh, no in misery ♫ Now listen ♫ if a man ever loved a woman - Why are you up so early? - I'm a working man. I work in exchange for money, that I use to procure both goods and services. - All right services. You're such an asshole. - Listen steal anything you like. I wouldn't eat what's in the fridge though. It's really more decorative than anything. - Of course, okay. - Bye. - What? - Nothing, shut up, god, bye. (telephone ringing) - Are you alive? - I'm fine that's why I'm calling. I'm sorry I didn't come home. - You're a grown up. But it'd be nice if you'd called. - I'm apologizing. - Would it be intruding if I asked where you are? - Yes. But I'm at Ray's. - Uh-huh. - I don't know, mommy, he's made lots of changes. Honestly I'm really happy when we're together. - The only thing I want is for you to be happy when you're alone. I wish I was. I get so sad when I'm by myself. - Me too sometimes. - The truth is that everyone and everything else is just fleeting. It's just a blurry landscape out the window of a speeding train. - Geez, it's not that bad is it? Can't I be on the train with you? - Yeah. Yes of course you have always been my traveling companion. - You remember that time when we took the bus to Madison and I threw up on daddy's over coat? - God, he was so mad at me that day. I wouldn't let him bring a flask. - You never talk about him. - I don't think about him that much. I mean he was only in my life for eight years and he's been gone for three times that, wow. - That's so weird. - Kind of wish he was around now though. Be fun to have something to look forward to or someone to look forward with. - You have lots to look forward to. - Yes, and so do you, sweetie. I mean, Cassie, you are so bright. You could be anything you want. - I told you I'm going to LA, and I told you I'm up for that cop show. It could be a really big deal. I'm making it all happen you'll see. - Yeah, yeah, yeah listen I gotta go because my cereal's getting gloppy. Okay, I love you. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey, Julie, Bob said you wanted to see me. - Yeah, I have some bad news. - Shit. - I'm sorry, Ray. You're a real hard worker, but the local's busting my balls. - I'll join the union I tried twice already. - I'm sorry. If I need some extra hands, I'll give you a call. But right now I don't have anything for you. - Well, that's just fucking great. I'll go stand outside Home Depo. - Good luck, Ray. - Hi, morning. - Hey, morning. How was last night did you make any progress? - I don't know isn't your dad here? - He's out. What do you mean you don't know? - We need to find someone else? - Why? - Well, he's not going for it. - You're supposed to convince him. - [Cassidy] I tried. - Yeah, I bet. - What's that supposed to mean? - You're wearing the same clothes you left in last night. - That's none of your business. - What about LA? You come up with some other career plan I don't know about? - I can't make him do it? - Yes, of course you could, but you don't want to because you like him. - I'm sorry I have feelings for you, Alex, I do, but Ray and I have a lot of history together. - Please, alright don't flatter yourself. - Look we can still figure it out, right. It just can't be Ray, okay. - It's not okay. What are you bringing to this arrangement? If you want a piece of this, you're gonna have to do something. I know that's not your thing-- - Fuck you. You don't know anything about me. You know what take that back. - [Alex] Couldn't he be setting you up right now? He could just have some dope waiting for you right outside that door. - [Cassidy] No, no he wouldn't do that to me. - So you say but he's not gonna warn you if he is gonna do it, right. It's possible. - [Dealer] Your girl still work at Tartuffo's? - No, she works down at Jeweler's Row now. - No, shit, I'll keep an eye out. Take care, bro. Let's get out of here. - Shit. - [Alex] It's possible, right? - Technically. - So just hold on to it. Okay, you never know. But you have to be ready every time you leave. This is gonna work, Cassidy, but you gotta have faith, okay. Hey, will you meet me somewhere somewhere where you won't see anyone you know? Where's that? - Fuck Pop. Anything that's worth real money he takes to Canada through Sault Ste. Marie himself. He's got some guy in Toronto who fucking resells it in China. - No, shit. - I was told there was opportunity for growth. I was told that this was an organization that likes to promote from within, you know. No, there is no organization. It's just one old ass thief with tuna breath just getting over on reputation. It's time I start to look out for myself. I'm not doing this when I'm 30. - Alright, let's do it. I'll give you 25% of whatever I sell it for. - Hell no. You'll give me 50. - That's ridiculous. - No, we aren't negotiating. - Fine 35, but you have to wait for my go ahead, okay. We gotta make sure that she's got enough on her to make it worth it. - Maybe I should just rob her on my own keep the diamonds and tell you to go fuck yourself. - You wouldn't do that. - Yeah, why not? - Because, well, for one you would have no idea how to sell a lose diamond without getting arrested, and, secondly, because despite your job you're fundamental an ethical person. - [Cassidy] Sorry for just barging in. - Are you kidding me you have an open invitation. I'll get you a key. - I had to get out of the apartment. Barry is there like all the time now. All he does is drink warm club soda and swear at the local news. - Do you want a drink? - [Cassidy] Yeah, I'll take a beer if you've got one. - [Ray] I think I have a few Daisy Cutters. - At least they're going away for the weekend. It'll be nice to have the place to myself for a few days. - [Ray] Who? - Mom and Barry. He's taking her to Lake Geneva. - Nice. - Yeah. - Does that mean we get to play house? - Oh, god, dude I cannot handle being at my mom's anymore. - Please come here. I'll leave you be. You can stay in the other room. Just give a knock when you want some action or whatever. - We have to eat, dummy. How much money do you have in the bank right now anyway? - Plenty. (loud knocking) - It's the cops, pussy. Let me in. Yeah, yeah, well if you quit, what's up. If you quit being a big giant baby about it maybe I'll get you some too. Sure. No, but don't wear those espadrilles alright they're gross. What's good? Hey, sorry, so I can't really hang out. I just came to grab-- - This is Cassidy. Cassidy, this is my friend Cosby. - Hi. - He's Irish. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Sorry, fucking around. So I just came to pick up my stuff. - The tools. - Yeah, the tools. - Yeah, one second. - I'm putting up a spice rack. So just probably the screw driver and the shears and other shit. You know what my friend Stephon he was just saying that he was actually thinking of doing some remodeling as well so do you think that you have any tools he could borrow. - I cannot believe this. I am an idiot. So much for the new you. - Cassidy it's not what it looks like. Shit. I got fired. I'm sorry. You want money. You want to go to LA I'm trying to figure it out. I'm not sitting around feeling sorry for myself pretending some lottery ticket's about to come in. - I'm sorry. I don't share your Protestant work ethic. Selling Adderall to tweakers is really inspirational. - Cass, I didn't mean-- - I'll see you later. - Yikes. Hey, do you really have that Adderall though? 'Cause the Ritalin gave me the squirts. - Hey, honey how you doing? - I thought you were going to Lake Geneva? - [Barry] Just finishing a couple of things. - So what do you got for me today? - I got one just give me a minute to get the package together. - Is this is the silent treatment? - Just working. - Westermann. - Westermann? - Where's that? - On Harrison just this side of the river. Hustle they're expecting you. I gotta get going. Alex, do not forget the alarm. - What do you want from me? - Nothing, okay. Nothing. There are people who actually do shit, and there are people who just talk shit. Go make your deliver, please. (telephone ringing) Hello. Vikram, hey, what are you looking for?

Nice job. - Seriously nothing from you guys? Is that what you had in mind, or were you I don't know thinking of something else? - That was fine. - [Cassidy] I'm very sorry to interrupt your important conversation over there. - Cassidy. - Honestly, honey, I think we are looking for a different type. - Like 26, big tits, veneers. - Cassidy - Good choice, brave choice. Let me guess is the partner a black guy about a retire or a Saint Bernard. - Okay, I'm so sorry. - [Thom] Should we call security?

You know what I think we're done. - What are you saying? - [Bettina] I mean it we're through. - Come on, Bettina, this is my career. - Oh, honey, be honest with yourself what career are you talking about? Other than the pilot which we know how that went you have booked an industrial and a radio commercial in five years. I mean you gave it a shot. It didn't happen. It's time to move on and do something else with your life. - No, please, please you are over reacting. I will go back there right now, and I will apologize. - Tell them I'll be there in a minute.

Let's catch these assholes, okay. Feel better. - Thank you for being so nice to me. - Thank you, officer. - So what happened? - These two guys beat me up ripped my pocket off. I didn't have a chance. - Dammit. You were supposed to be ready. - They want me to stay overnight. They think I have a concussion. - Is your mom coming back? - She's not answering her phone. - Yeah, neither is my dad. Look I have to ask you. Do you think the guys were with Ray? - No. He wouldn't let anyone hurt me? - How do you know for sure? Were they white? Were they black? Someone knew, right? Someone knew what you were carrying. - I had a plastic bag over my head. I couldn't see anything. What do you want from me? - Everything okay in here? - Yeah, I'm sorry.

Good, good. Again. What are you doing here? How'd you find me? - I have an internet connection. You're not in the CIA. Now tell me you have my diamonds. - Yeah, Alex, I don't have time for this right now, okay. - Well, make time. - Do you think you can just come up in my house and start barking orders, do you? Boy, I have 20 third graders waiting in a gym for me to teach them karate, and any one of them can beat your ass. That's right. Now imagine what I could do? - Just tell me you have my diamonds or not? - Alex, you have until tomorrow to get Pop's money, okay? What is this? You wanna be a gangsta? 'Cause you 'bout to find out what real gangsta shit looks like. (dramatic music) - [Ray] Cassidy, Cassidy. Oh, shit. - [Guard] Visiting hours are over. You can't go down there. - I'm looking for Cassidy Harper. - And you are? - Her husband. - Okay, well, she's not married.

Broken wrist, maybe cracked ribs, this thing on my head. What time is it? - I don't know 9:30. Tell me what happened. - That means two and a half hours till my next pill that is some bullshit. - Easy, easy, easy lie down, lie down. Can you remember what happened? - Yeah, two stupid boys pushed me into the alley and ripped my pants. I love those pants. - Okay, it's okay. What do you need? Ice? An extra blanket or something? - Look at us we're twins? God, who's gonna take care of us, huh? We're all broken up. - I will you just relax, okay. I'll take care of everything. - No, no we need a grown up. I'm sorry about before. Are you mad at me? - No, of course I'm not mad, stupid. - I'm tired. - Close your eyes. Close your eyes. - Couple of broken ups. - [Nurse] Okay, visiting hours are over. You can come back tomorrow. (dramatic music) - Good morning, sunshine. How you feeling? - Dreadful. What time did you get in? - Couple of hours ago. I'm sorry, baby, I didn't even check my phone until almost midnight. - You didn't need to come. I'm fine. - Right, I'm gonna be gettin' hot stone massages while you're here in the hospital. How's the arm? - It hurts. - Want me to go out there and do the Shirley MacLaine? - Yes, I will pay you five bucks, please. - Barry's beside himself. He thinks he's responsible which told him is nuts. He wants you to know that of course their insurance is gonna take care of everything. He said he'd pay you until you get back on your feet again. - That's nice of him. - He's a good man. In fact I have some exciting news. So Barry last night says to me that he is really ready to retire, and he wants to go down to Fort Meyers as soon as possible. He's asked me to go with him. - What did you say? - What do you mean I said yes. - Just like that you're gonna spend your golden years with Barry? - I am gonna go to Florida with Barry, and I'm gonna make a real life for myself, yes. - Do you love him? - I think I could. - So you're settling? - You are too old to be so naive. It's all settling. There are no rich princes. Nobody ever becomes an astronaut or a ballerina. I mean listen to me for once, please. All you have to do is you have to find some way to be useful and maybe loved and find somebody that maybe you can share some laughs with that's all there is. Cassidy, what's so terrible about having a regular life? I'm gonna go down to Florida and I am going to sit in the sun until I look like an old shoe, and you're gonna see how happy I am. It's gonna be okay. - We never let a runner go out on the street with that kind of inventory. - I'm supposed to hire an armored car for three stones? - When they're worth $482,000 you are. They're never gonna pay us you know that, right? - They have to pay us it was a robbery. She got beat up there's a police report and a witness. We're insured on courier transactions up to a half million. - It's fishy as fuck. - The hell with it I don't care. - Excuse me. - I'm retiring I'm moving to Fort Meyers with Valerie. - [Alex] You're kidding. - This is as good a time as any. If there's a business left, it's all yours. I wash my hands. - You can afford to retire? - I do not need much. I found a little place. - If the insurance company decides not to pay off? - Then you're gonna need a job, but hello Florida. - Maybe I should just stay home. - Come on. It's Judy's 60th birthday. She's gonna be crushed if you don't go to her party. Look it is a broken wrist. Ray is perfectly capable of keeping an eye on me. (loud knocking) - Through three inches of plexiglass. Coming. Hello, Raymond. - Hello, Ms. Harper. - [Valerie] No, call me Valerie. - Yes, mom, you can me Ray. It's actually my whole name Ray no middle name either. I think my parents could only afford a few letters. - How you feeling, champ? - Like smashed assholes. - That's a powerful image, honey. Okay, Ray, thank you so much for being on duty. She gets her next pill at 7:30. She does. - Happy to be of service. - Alright I won't be late. - I'll say hi to Judy for you, bye. - Bye, mommy, make sure somebody walks you to the taxi. - [Valerie] Okay, bye. - Go lie down I'm on the case. - Hold on what happened to your cast? It's not time yet. - I'm fine only one patient at a time. - Are you okay? It's so scrawny and pale. - Yeah, I get that a lot. (cellphone buzzing) - Hi. Right now? Okay, yeah, calm down shit. Okay, yes, yes I will come. I'm on my way alright bye. Hey, what's the deal are you okay? - I'm fine. - You sounded pretty upset. - Well, I've got problems. - Well, tell me what's going on? - You remember the rum? - Yeah. - Well, the guys that I borrowed that money from are coming to collect. - I don't get it you need me to be a witness or something when you give them the money? - I don't have the money. I need you to tell me if they're the ones who jacked you. - Hold up. I got put in the hospital over some money you borrowed, and now you're gonna put me in middle of it again. - I'm almost positive that's not what happened. - I didn't see them you selfish motherfucker. I had a fucking grocery bag over my face. - [Alex] Yeah, but you might be able to tell me if it could be them just based on size or voices or whatever. - I am leaving. - Look they're gonna be here any minute. You wanna run into them in the hallway. - I cannot believe you did this to me, Alex. - Look, this could be it, Cassidy. I might be able to get our money, and it could be a lot like way more than what we thought. You're an actress, right? Put your game face on. - You are an ass wipe. - We need a signal. If you think it's them, then cross your arms like this. - Where do you get this shit? (loud knocking) - Okay, be cool, and get them to talk. Okay, get them to talk, so we can hear their voices. We need to be sure. Okay, come on. - Who's this? - [Alex] Cassidy. - I see, Cassidy, could you excuse us please? - No, I don't think so. Hello. - Hey. - I'm Cassidy what's your name? - Malik. - Malik, where you from. - Atlanta. - I got the worst case of food poisoning there. What about you what's your name? - Quincy and I'm from Delaware pretty lady. - I don't have your money. - [Anthony] Then why am I here then? - He is really an enigma. - I'm not giving you a nickel until you give me my goddamn stones. - I already explained I don't have anything for you. - Okay, quit fucking around. You think I'm some kind of trick. You can just run game on me. - Alex, it is not them. - Are you sure? - Wait not who? - What the fuck is going on here? - [Alex] Dad, take your friend and get out of here now. - I have business to take care of. Cassidy, what are you doing here? How's your arm, honey, you should be relaxing. Take her home, Alex. - I'm okay just a little sore. - Who are these people? - This is Quincy and Malik, and I don't know who this handsome devil is. - He works for me. - [Anthony] Sorry Pop I didn't know you were gonna be here. - Wait a second. Lil Pop is white. - You're funny. Anthony didn't tell me you were funny. - What are you doing with my father? He has nothing to do with this. - What are you talking about? - Anthony makes collections for me. - You borrowed money from a gangster? - Excuse me. - No offense. Why didn't you come to me? - I have a better question. What are you doing showing up here with him in the middle of the goddamn night? - Business. - Here hold on to that. What happen to your arm? - Broke my wrist. - You're the schlepper. Those idiot Mexicans beat you up? - Excuse me. - Get her out of here. I can't have her talking to her mother about my business. - What kind of business do you with that guy? - Has it ever occurred to you that I know what I'm doing? - What's going on right now? What's in the envelope? - It's like you've learned nothing from me. Keep your mouth shut. Say you understand? - I don't understand at all. - Sweetheart, it'll all be over soon. Let daddy work. - We're gonna settle this right now. What does he owe you? - 36. - [Barry] How much of that is juice. - [Anthony] It's about half. - You're taking my kid for a ride? - He's a grown up it's business. - [Barry] Call it 22, add it to your end. - You set me up. You had some guys beat me up and steal the stones? - I'm sorry, honey, please don't tell your mom. They went way overboard, but it had to look real. There's gonna be plenty of money for everybody. - Did you know about this? - What do you think? - I think maybe I should call the cops and report an insurance fraud that's what I fucking think. - Don't do that. No, no, put that away. - Yeah, Pop, Pop. - Arty, Arty. - Okay, okay. - You're annoying me now. - [Alex] No one's going to the cops, okay. Everybody just stay calm. - You setting me up, Barry. Don't insult me. You're giving me $.60 on the dollar. Take the stones and go. - I'm gonna take the stones, and I'm gonna go. - Okay, please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. - [Anthony] Come on. - Aren't you forgetting something? - I don't think so. Anthony, am I forgetting something? - I don't know, Pop. - Arty, we've been doing this 30 years. I've always been straight with you. - In the end you gotta take people at their word even though it doesn't work. I knew it. (loud bang) - Shit, god dammit. - Oh, my god. - Who's this asshole. - He's my boyfriend. (Ray groaning) Oh, my god. - I'm calling an ambulance. - Put the phone down. - Okay. - What you're gonna shoot everybody start with me. (Ray groaning) - Pop, we need to go now. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I need an ambulance to 5 South Wabash 10th floor a man's been shot. - Arty, you've always been a stand up guy. Leave me that bag of money. - Your kid's even anybody else who wants to keep waking up in the morning better keep their mouth shut. - What the fuck have I done? - Ray, what are you doing here? - I woke up and you were gone. I thought you might be meeting him. I didn't know this was whatever the fuck this was. (emergency siren blaring) - It's about the robbery. - [Ray] He set you up. - [Alex] You don't know what you're talking about. - That's not true, Ray. - You think we're fucking stupid. Think we're some fucking idiots who'll believe whatever shitty lie you come up with. You set her up. - Hey, asshole, we were setting you up. Yeah, me and Cassidy we were gonna pin you for the robbery, and then we were gonna keep the stones and we were gonna split the profit. What do you think about that? - You were gonna steal from me? - [Ray] Cass. - It wasn't like that, Ray. (loud knocking) - What was it like? - [Durant] Anybody in here have a weapon? - No. - I wish. - [Westbrook] Alright we're clear. What happened here? - [Alex] We were working late, and these two Columbian guys came in with guns and Cassidy's boyfriend surprised them. They shot him and they took off. - [Durant] How long ago? - 10 minutes. - You get a look at these guys? - Yeah, black sweatshirts with hoods. Red bandanna on one of them. The other one had some kind of wrestling mask. It was blue with yellow lightening bolts. - How do you know they were Columbian? - They were speaking Spanish. - Raciest. He's a raciest, officer. You should probably shoot him. I won't say anything. - I'm riding in the ambulance. - Family only. Family only she's not in my family. - Ray, this is not what it looks like. - You know what your problem is? You lie to yourself constantly. Just be honest for once. You don't give a shit about me and you never did. - That's not true I love you. - I don't care what anyone says you are a good actress. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - It's all fucked. I've ruined it. I really love your mother you know that, right? We make each other laugh. Might seem like a small thing to you but it matters especially when you can see the cliff up ahead. We weren't gonna be rich or anything just enough to keep some groceries in the refrigerator buy some sun screen maybe get a little shack on the beach and sell T-shirts. Now I get nothing. God dammit. They'll carry me out of that office in a plastic bag. - This was your whole retirement plan? You have no other money? - It's gone I worked my ass off to pay off 30 years worth of debt, so I could give you the business in the clear now I've got gornisht. If I don't find 32 grand before day after tomorrow, I lose the condo in Fort Meyers and the escrow money. All I wanted to do was give my son a business make your mother happy. - You're so noble. When you hired two guys to break my arm, were you just thinking of everybody then too? - Let's not forget you two were planning to rob me, okay? Don't act like you're better than me neither of you. Let me out here. I'm sorry, honey, I'm sick about, but it had to look real. Now can tell you mom about it if you want too but you're gonna be wrecking a good thing really good thing. I don't know how in the hell I'm gonna tell her about Florida. I'm sorry, but it had to look real. - Are you gonna tell her? She'd never forgive him. - The department store where my mom works has that white ugly fluorescent light. Nobody looks good in that light, nobody I think they do it on purpose, so that you hate yourself and buy make up or a new dress or something. Anyway I was there the other day and I saw her hand in that light and see those little blue veins under her skin she's gonna be an old lady soon. Cannot leave her there behind that counter taking shit from people for the rest of her life. I have to do something not just talk about it. Your dad is no prize, but it's a way out at least. I can't let it evaporate. (Valerie grasping) - Where were you? - I went out. - I come home to an empty house. You don't even answer your phone. - The battery is dead I'm fine. - Where's Ray? - [Cassidy] Mom, what do you want from me? - There is something going on what is it? Whatever it is you can tell me and I want the truth. (dramatic music) - What'll you have? - [Cassidy] I'll take an Old Style. - Coming up. - [Cassidy] Where's your bathroom? - Down at the end on the right. (heavy breathing) - You do not matter. No one is watching. You are free. You do not matter. No one is watching. You are free. Would you tell Pop I need to talk to him, please? - [Bartender] Excuse me. - [Cassidy] Little Pop tell him he has a visitor. - I don't know who that is. - Tell him it's the schlepper. (dramatic music) (loud knocking) - What the fuck are you doing here? - Did you flip the stones yet? - What's it to you? - I have information that is very important to you but I expect to be compensated. - How about you tell me what it is and I'll compensate you by not cutting you up and putting you in a dumpster behind a hotdog stand. - I posted a picture online of me sitting at your bar. Local news loves a dead white girl. You wouldn't mind a few reporters and cops around here would you? - You're so clever. - [Cassidy] I'm trying to do you a favor. - Why because my gun felt so good up against your head. We're best friends now. You think I'm a fucking idiot. - Your friend Barry put me in the hospital as a prop for the insurance company. You think I'm gonna just say no problem go get a waitressing job? You give me $5,000. I save your ass and fuck him over at the same time. - How about I give you a $100 if I think the information is useful. - 5,000 cash in the next 30 seconds or I walk out of here and you take your chances. - Get back here already. (dramatic music) Alright Jimmy Olsen let's have it. - Barry Handleman is working with the federal government. They have audio recordings of you discussing the price and video surveillance of you receiving the stones in the office. - Why the fuck would he do that? He's the one who ripped them off to start with. - Well, one of the Columbians got pinched by the INS and rolled over on him. Barry got arrested for insurance fraud and conspiracy so he gave them to you. - No chance. - You're gonna cross in Sault Ste. Marie and sell them them in Toronto. That's interstate something and international diamond smuggling, right? Here's the real pisser. The stones he gave you were fucking fakes anyway. - You're full of shit. - It's your funeral. (loud knocking) - What's this? - She's telling me a story. She says Barry's working with the government and the stones are fake. - That's nonsense they're real. - [Cassidy] How do you know you're an expert? - Well, I sell jewelry of uncertain providence. I have methods to ascertain if a piece is a fake. - Methods, sounds serious. - Look, can I take a look? (tense music) - [Pop] So what do I do cut glass with it or something? - Look my keys cut glass. First, breathe on it. If it stays fogged up for more than a second, it's a fake. - [Pop] No, it's clear. - [Anthony] Okay alright that's a good sign. Let's see try this. - Is this the garbage test? - Lay that stone down on its flat side. Okay now if you can read the newsprint through the stone, it's a fake. - [Pop] No, I can't see shit. - Let me see it.- Back up. Yeah, looks real to me. Go head let her see it. - [Cassidy] Are you sure that's even true? - Absolutely. Alright now hold it up to the light. You see that sparkle? Now anything can sparkle, right? But how you can spot a fake is that it has no flaws at all. Now do you see any little spots any little marks in the middle? - Maybe down in the pointy part. - Let me see it. No, I still don't see shit. - [Anthony] Right there that's a real diamond. - Man, you don't not what you're talking about. - Get her out of here. Amateur hour's over. Get my money back. - We had a deal. Are you fucking kidding. - [Anthony] No he's not. - Welcher. - You're hurting my feelings now. - This is some bullshit. - [Anthony] Sure is turn around. - Dude, I can make my way out all right. - You can. - Yeah, yeah I can stop fucking following me. - Ask her to stop fucking following me. - Hey, hey your boss is an asshole. - Don't listen to her keep fucking moving. - Nice job. - Yes, of course it is. I think we're good. - Yeah, I'll see you tonight? - Yes, also you better tell Alex that I want my end in a briefcase. Okay, I'm a businessman with me like that. - Yes, sir, yes, sir. - Okay. I know have a good one. Shit. (dramatic music) - That's my money. You understand that, mine? But I'm gonna let you hold it. You're gonna buy that condo. You're gonna put my mom's name on the paper work next to yours and you're gonna send me a copy. If you try anything shady, Barry anything at all, I'm gonna call the cops and I'm gonna report you for insurance fraud, kapiche? - I don't know what to say. Thank you. What about Pop? - Just stay away. He thinks you're in witness protection. - What happens when he comes looking? - He got two stones. He's walking away with a boat load of money. He's not coming after you especially because he thinks the feds are watching. - I know him he'll just come to the office. - The movers are gonna be there tomorrow morning. I'm returning the stuff on memo and selling the rest to Hatoum. Looks like there's gonna be 8500 left over. Congrats, you made a profit old man. - Keep it. I'm just sorry that's all there is. I wanted to leave you set up. - Your guilt is present enough. - You're welcome. - I put that one who put this? - Yeah, but - I didn't put that. - If you put these two boxes. - Give me this it's gotta go in back now. - Well, okay, fine I don't think it's open. - Open the door. - I don't have the keys you have the keys. - You came down without the key. (dramatic music) - I was just thinking about all the hours I spent looking out this window wondering what was gonna happen next. - Well, now you know. - Well, goodbye. - Yeah. - Okay. - Alright, dad, okay. - Okay, thanks. - My girl, I love you so, so, so, much. This is gonna be great. - See you. - I'll call you when I get there. - Please do. - Can we go I'd like to make it to Memphis by nightfall. - Yeah, yeah, yeah thus it begins. Okay, goodbye, baby. Goodbye. Goodbye I love you so much. Oh, my gosh I'll call you as soon as I get there, okay. Alright don't forget about me. Call a lot, a lot. - Put your seat belt on. - Crazy kids. - So when are you leaving? - This afternoon. Just cleaning up a little so she gets her security deposit back. - You have enough for your trip? - Uh-huh, even got a month's rent left over. - We didn't get rich did we? - Not yet. Maybe I'll see you in Fort Meyers at Christmas. - Yeah. (lively music) ♫ Oh, baby ♫ It's alright what you say today - Look excuse me, sir, can you just hold on for one second? Excuse me. Yeah. - I don't understand. I have the rest of the money right here. I'm getting out of this goddamn city, and I just want to pay it off. - Man, I'd love to take it but it's already been paid. I sold a broad a Corolla like three days ago, and she paid off the whole note. - You saying some random stranger paid off my note. - Maybe you have a secret admirer. - Bullshit I'm a grown man. It's my debt I'm paying it off. - Okay, well, you have to go pay her yourself. She left a forwarding address for the title. It's in California. - California. - California. (lively music) - They're ready for you. - Hi, come on in. You can have a seat. - Hi, I'm Marilyn. - [Felicia] Hi. - Hi. - Alright you can start whenever you're ready. - Hi, I'm Marilyn Tracy. Doctor, have the lab results come in yet? - [Cassidy] I'm afraid I have some bad news. - [Marilyn] God, my poor baby. - It seems your husband contracted a parasite while he was in Africa. - [Marilyn] Well, that explains it. The sweating, the hives. - We may have to consider a transplant. We need a donor, and we're running out of time. - [Marilyn] Doctor, I have an idea, but he can never know. We have a son. - Thanks so much, Marilyn. - [Marilyn] Thanks bye. - She was good I liked it. (lively music)
