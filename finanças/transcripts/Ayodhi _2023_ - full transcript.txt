We are going to Rameshwaram next week on a pilgrimage. Pack two days earlier. - Yes. The coffee is cold. Get me hot coffee. - Okay. On 'Deepavali' day? 'Rameshwaram.' The right person has to teach you a lesson, isn't it? How dare you rip the fishing net? I'll rip your intestines apart. Get lost! Come, brother. 'Ayothi.' Mom? Shivani. Which saree shall I wear in Rameshwaram? Your favourite colour, 'will be absolved.' 'Kavacha Theertham.' 'People who bathe in this spring will not go to hell.' 'The spring is also located in the Sethu Madhava temple.' Janaki. - The vibe... Dad is ready. You get ready too, go. - Hmm. Get ready soon. - Mom, why leave now to catch the 8 PM train?

Understand? Sit down. Wait here. I'll be back. Mom, how long is it to Rameshwaram from here? I don't know, dear. It may take 1-2 hours. That long? Let's go, I got a cab. - Okay. Make it fast. Mom, I need to use the bathroom. Why didn't you go on the train? It's festival time, you saw the mad crowd in there. How could I? Okay, wait. - Open the boot. Get in. Listen, we'll be back in a bit. - Why? Shivani needs to use the toilet. Oh my God! Do you know what your problem is? You both don't know where and how to behave. What bad timing. She's a teenager. - Absolutely not. Stop being a drama queen. I'm anxious about reaching Rameshwaram, before sunrise. End of the discussion. Nothing wrong in holding on for a while. Get into the taxi. Fine. Sir, belt. Wear your seat belt. Oh... Seat belt. Do you have an air conditioner? AC... air conditioner You... Wait, I'll switch it on. Speed only 70?

You tell. - We don't have a neurosurgeon, take her to the government Hospital in Madurai, you can save her. What are you saying? - Severe head injury. Cerebral haemorrhage. Shift to Madurai Government Hospital immediately, okay? Ventilator ambulance 108 is not available. Arrange for a private ambulance quickly. Ambulance. Ask him to do so, why should I?

But the driver has gone to the temple. What do I do now? Is the ambulance ready? Time is of the essence to save her. - I'm coming, sir. Ask him to arrange it faster. - Is there no other ambulance? 'I have enquired in four different places.' 'I can't get a ventilator ambulance.' We have no other option, brother.' 'Shall I wait here till the driver returns, Brother?' We don't have time for all that You drive the ambulance here. We can ask the driver to come to the hospital. Sir, my duty gets over in ten minutes. David will take over, sir. We don't have time until he comes, go. Ask them to get in. What happened? The driver promised to come but isn't picking up my call now. What do we do now, Brother?

You are okay, mom. - Please look at her. Get up, mom. Janaki. Janaki. Ja... Do something. - Mom? Can't you hear me? Why are you sitting quietly? Out of your mind or what? Look at her. - Mom? Janaki. Mom! Mom! Mom. Mom! Mom! Tell me. - That lady passed away. Where are you now? - Near ring road in Madurai. Drop her at Madurai General Hospital. Police will take care of the rest. Okay. Bro, you have to tell, right? - I'm here only to do emergency first aid. I can't say if she's alive or dead. Hey, speak like a human. - Only a doctor can. Won't you declare her dead? I can't pronounce her dead. Only a doctor can certify. Try to understand. - Hey, what's the problem? I believe he cannot say if she's alive or dead. Better to get it confirmed by a doctor. Mad fellow! What, sir? - She's dead. Take the body to GH. - What? Post mortem. - Post mortem. No. No post mortem. Post-mortem is compulsory. Accidental death. - You don't understand. If I say no, it means 'no'. How do I explain? How do I make them understand? Brother, listen. We follow 'Dharma'. 'Culture.' Our religion doesn't allow it. Post mortem. If she dies. After death. The last rite is on the pyre. Before that, no cutting or any poking. No. - What is he saying? Sir, he comes from a family which follows righteousness strictly. He says post-mortem is not allowed. If it is done, he says he will be in a royal mess. Where did you find him? - What? Brother. - No, the postmortem... Want to use the restroom? Sir, is there any bathroom? - Right there. Try and convince him. Okay, sir, please come. 'We'll be back now. - Why?' 'Shivani needs to use the toilet.' 'Nothing wrong in holding on for a while.' 'Get into the taxi.' 'Mahant of Deshrath Gaddi, our Baba Brij Mohan Das never remains sad.' 'Mahant of Deshrath gaddi...' Hello, Ram Dutt. - Hey Balram! Had a good pilgrimage in Rameshwaram? Janaki passed away. - Oh God! When? Doctor is insisting on a post-mortem. No post-mortem. According to our religious beliefs, the body, once dead should not be cut open. Listen to me. You bring Janaki here to Ayodhya. Ram Dutt, there are no trains for three days. Why do you have to bring her in a train or a bus? Airlift her. Do you have cash with you? - I lost it all. The bag, cash, and clothes are all gone. Don't worry. Go to the airport. I'll send you the cash. Thank you, Ram Dutt. You're doing unnecessary stuff. We're in a rush, just like you. Keep quiet. - So...? Will you get confirmation from all the quack doctors on the roadside? Why will we come here knowing she's dead? That is not my job. I can only do first aid. Only government doctors will follow procedures and tell you factually. Damn the procedure! - Look here. Drop us at the airport. I'll handle the rest. What? To the airport? I can't go to the airport. I'll deliver the body at GH. After that, bloody well follow their advice. Sir, watch your tongue. Had this lady got hurt ten minutes later, I would've been home by this time. Unnecessarily you are bugging me. All my fate! Get into the van. You can go in ten minutes. Don't scream now. Get into the van. Get in. Wonder what more will happen! Tough to handle this Hindi man and mad chap. - Brother. We don't know anyone here. I don't understand your language. If you would like to help us. Send us back home at the earliest. Please. What does she want? I can't understand what she is saying. But I figure she's asking us to help her. Hey! Go away. Go burst the crackers over there. Bursting crackers near my brand-new bike! Happy Diwali, dude. Will they allow a dead body on the flight? Yes, they will. But some rules and regulations are to be followed. We must enquire only at the airport. Any problem? Nothing. I will call you later. Hey, where are you going? Why did you turn left? You have to go straight for GH. Stop the vehicle. - Why invite trouble? Poor thing! Let's drop them off at the airport. You. Hey! Stop the vehicle. Where are you happily driving off to? Hey, you are going as you wish. We'll drop them off and come back soon. I insist you stop the vehicle. How can we stop on a highway? - I insist you stop the vehicle. He might jump off the vehicle, mad fellow. Pull over on the kerb side. I swear, I will... Hey, get off the vehicle. Get down, I say. Are you thinking that you are driving a call taxi? Turning as you wish with a corpse inside! The airport is very close to here. If we buy them two tickets and drop them at GH, they'll go home. Some stranger died. Going overboard as if it is your mother! You've been nasty from the beginning. What is your problem? Listen, an ambulance will go to the airport first and then to GH. Get in if you want. Otherwise, leave. Sir, a lady passed away She has to be airlifted. Then you must enquire about cargo. Where is it? - Take a left. Dude, you stay here. Please come with me. Come. To send dead bodies by flight You should have a police FIR, mortuary card, death report, police clearance certificate, embalming certificate, sealing certificate, undertaking certificate. Along with these, we need ID card of the dead person. Also, a person to go with the body. This is our protocol, sir. What is this, sir? Your list is endless. Air India flight leaves at 8:00 pm. If you arrive two hours before departure, we can send the body by that flight. This is the last flight to Lucknow for tonight. If you don't make it, the next flight is only after four days. The last flight? How much will it cost? Total money? Three tickets, cargo. Approximately one lakh rupees. How much? - One lakh rupees. One lakh rupees? - Yes. Don't buy the tickets first. Arrange for the seven certificates and then buy the tickets. Sir, even changing the initials in our ration cards name will take one month. And you are asking for seven certificates in one day! That too on a festival day. How is it possible to get it? What to do? I have to follow our rules. Hello, what? - How can it cost one lakh rupees? Where? - Trying to fool us? I'll be right there. - How can it be one lakh rupees? Brother, this is government fixed-rate. Where are you going? Hey, at least talk about the post-mortem. Why do they need so many certificates? Listen... What is that bag in your hand? - My sister's blouse. Why are you here? - I came to help them. Pandi, what is happening? You manhandled the white uniform and he called the khaki uniform! Hey, who are you? Sir, I drove the ambulance. - Are you an ambulance driver? No, sir. - Then? How are you related to them? Sir, they are tourists from Ayothi. On the way to Rameshwaram... - Get into the police jeep. Get the ambulance, bring them. Get them in. - Why are you taking us, sir? Get in the vehicle. - What did we do, sir? Get them all into the jeep. - What mistake did we commit, sir? Go. Senthil, park the ambulance at GH and come to the police station. On a festival day they give us a hard time! This is for Inspector's sister-in-law. This too, sir? - Yes. I have parked the vehicle in government Hospital, here's the key. (Voice in the walkie talkie) Are you a troublemaker? If you manhandle a staff member on duty. As per Section #332, you get imprisonment for three years. Do you know? Brother, do you know them? - No, sir. Why did you bring us here? Look, my wife just died. I have to leave immediately. - Relax. What is he saying? Post-mortem is out of the question. My wife... My wife's body cannot be cut or dissected by anyone. Sir. - No! I won't allow post-mortem. You are objecting to post-mortem. Then did you kill her? If you raise your voice you'll bleed instead of peeing if I hit you. Brother, enquire about them individually. Check if their stories match. - Okay, sir. Come with me. Brother, you come along too. Will they visit Rameshwaram even during the festival of lights? Lord Rama built that temple. He is their family deity. That temple is open to devotees the whole year through. Give sir that milk sweet. What is that? From which shop? - Deepavali freebies, sir. He gave us stale sweets! - We can shut down his shop, sir. First, do that. This chap seems so familiar. He has robbed a drunken slob lying on the road, sir. Passers-by who saw called. Sir, once sober, he'll make a beeline to the government liquor shop I kept it as a safety measure. Bloody thief! Heard that excuse, head constable? He is going to call me. Come here. - I am in for it. Hello, sir. - Hey! What are you up to? - Sir, greetings. You detained me for a day and thrashed me in Tirunelveli. Do you remember me? Okay. Did I jog his memory in haste? That was a long time ago. I don't steal now, sir. Why is he shifting his posture? I'll try to wriggle out of it. This is just a matter of habit, sir. Caught red-handed. Hey! You sing, right? Yes, sir. You're right, sir. Shall I sing about my girl? Do you mean to say you have a girlfriend? Yes, sir. I interrogated them, sir. They are from the government Hospital in Ramnad. He has the AR copy, sir. It is an accident case. No other problem. If you file a first information report, I can take them to the mortuary, sir. What are you looking at? You are the one to blame. Sir, I'll take leave. Hey! Where are you off to? None of you can step out without doing the post-mortem. Go and sit. - What did I do, sir? I just lent a helping hand. Is catching roadside travellers your idea of help, eh? Any accident is a police case. When you drove to the airport instead of a government Hospital. You committed a crime. Why should I even talk to you? - Sir. I'll handle this, sir. Come with me. Come along, brother. Whichever angle you view this, you can't step out now. If you are a bit patient, you can get the post-mortem report from the mortuary, and go home. This isn't a place to fight. Who will help if he behaves like this? Natural Instinct will be to step back. I understand, please sit. If you don't sing properly, I'll slap you on the cheek! Okay, sir. Sing now. My glasses? "She stole the heart of a thief." "She made an impact on this dry heart of mine." "She stole the heart of a thief." "She made an impact on this dry heart of mine." "We shared milk popsicles juicy near the pillars" "and shared it with certain intimacy." "Her slightest glance of desire will make cold water catch fire!" "Even a red ant will fall for her words." "She asked for a gold chain as a gift, I stole it with my expertise." "To give her a gold earring." "I saw ninety ears before snatching it." "She stole the heart of a thief." "She made an impact on this dry heart of mine." "She stole the heart of a thief." "She made an impact on this dry heart of mine." "Pretty as our head constable is she." "Just like you, her father would glare at me." "Her skin tone is like this stick." "If I make a mistake, she will spear me with her eyes." "I scattered into pieces explosively when her pinky finger touched me." "When both her hands touched me I forgot my existence truly." "I have always stolen and got away most often." "But in her heart alone I got caught all of a sudden." "She blazed, shining bright in my heart and mind with delight." "Like a grain to the soil forged into my soul and merged forever." "She stole the heart of a thief." "She made an impact on this dry heart of mine." "She stole the heart of a thief." "She made an impact on this dry heart of mine." "We shared milk popsicles juicy near ten popsicles" "and shared it with certain intimacy." "Her slightest glance of desire will make cold water catch fire!" "Even a red ant will fall for her words." "She asked for a gold chain as a gift." "With my expertise, I stole it." "She wanted gold earrings as gift ." "I checked ninety ears before I snatched it." Brother. When did you flick this? They don't know Tamil anyway. Okay, anyway, the post-mortem report will certify it is an accidental death. Despite it, if the cops nab us. We can cover up asking him to forgive us, giving Deepavali as a suitable excuse. Why invite more trouble? We will leave in ten minutes. Balram. If you want to return safely, hold your tongue in the mortuary. I won't agree to post-mortem. No post mortem, no Ayothi. Understand? Get down. Come. Come. Come, sir. Hurry up. What is this ruckus? - Greetings, sir. Thirteen dead bodies today, sir. A 9-year-old kid committed suicide because his parents didn't buy him crackers. I'll drink tea and be back. - Okay. How could he kill himself for this? - That's how our world is now. It costs one lakh rupees to airlift the body? Cheaper to take her by road in an ambulance. That will be even more expensive. Cops will stop you at check posts the entire three day journey and hassle you. That's even more torture. No freezer facilities on the train and the body will decompose. So whoever dies here, flight is the only option. Damn! Give me money for tea. - I don't have any cash on me. Don't be mean, head constable. - Shut up! Don't be a pain! Here. - Thank you, sir. We can show off as police outside. We have to be friendly with them. Otherwise, they won't release the dead body till evening. Who is he? How stone-hearted can he be! He hasn't shed a single tear for his wife. Hey, Muruga brother. Hey, Muthu. What? - Celebrating Deepavali at the mortuary? These cops will take care of the rest. Let's go back home. Let's go, Brother. - Wait, let me go and tell her. I'm leaving. Do you understand what I'm saying? - I'm sure she will, let's go. Sonu? Sonu? Sonu? Sonu? Sonu? Sonu? Sonu? Sonu? Sonu! Sonu? So... Sir? No... no need. Do you wish to donate your wife's eyes? Wife? - Yes. What 'wife'? - Eye donation. Eye...? - Yes. Eye donation? - Yes. My wife's eyes? - Yes. Get away from here. What nonsense! - Real madcap! First, dissecting her body. Now grabbing her eyes? Do you have any saree to drape around your mother? Bring her saree. Okay, sir. Poor thing! Not knowing the local language. And losing her mother is a cruel blow. 'Your favourite colour.' I celebrated Deepavali with you for the past four years. Even on a festival day, a policeman gets only a cold meal! Take it. Dissect Kumar. This case is through us. Deal with it carefully. - You've told me, right? Check the body after I prepare it. You'll think she's asleep. - Okay, go. Sit down, dear. 'Send us home at the earliest.' 'Please.' 'What does she want?' 'I can't understand what she is saying.' 'But I figure she's asking us to help her.' 'Who is he? How stone-hearted can he be!' 'He hasn't shed a single tear for his wife.' Hey! Turn the ambulance. Reverse the vehicle. Hey! Do as I say. What happened, brother? If we leave her halfway through my mind will be guilt-ridden. You leave if you want. I'll stay and help them. Bro, I said, 'Let us leave.' I never said I would leave alone. Come, let's try our best. Must take her to your city. Do you have cash on you? Money... money. - No, accident. Lost. Will come in thirty minutes. Your wife is dead. - Have you arranged cash for the ticket? Wait, he doesn't have money. We have to arrange it. That isn't real gold. That is just fake gold. How much do you have? Give it. Take this cash. Buy the ticket. I'll send you the balance cash, go. Do it. - Durai, please speed it up. - Okay. What is the next step, sir? - Next is embalming. Must get permission from the Dean. Today is Deepavali, So she won't sign. What do you do... His name is Chitrapandian. If he recommends, the Dean will sign. Token number one-Murali. Sir, Deepavali. Token number two-Janaki. Give whatever you can. It's Deepavali, a festival day. Got cash on you? I gave you whatever I had. Why do you ask now when we are stressed. Brother, here you are. Go give it to counter number four. Hey, out of seven certificates required by the cargo officer, we have got four ready. - We have only four more hours left. We must get three more certificates, arrange one lakh cash and send them right away. I'm asking you again. Do you have to take so much risk and send them home? At any point of time in your life without anyone coming to your aid. Have you stood all alone in front of the pyre of your most loved one? To get them out of this place as fast as we can is the biggest favour we can do for them. Is it even possible? - Why not? I believe if Chitrapandian recommends the Dean will sign immediately. How about the money? That man said people from his town will send money. Listen, you take them to the Dean's house. I'll bring Chitrapandian, go. - Okay. Dude, we have eighteen thousand rupees with the gold chain and cash you gave. But one ticket costs sixteen thousand and five hundred rupees. We can book one ticket for now. Whose name should we book? Whose name should it be? Anyway, we can't book in that man's name. Both his children will be stuck alone. Can't book in minor son's name, because he can't fly alone. The only option is to get a ticket for that girl. Okay, book it in her name. Dude, I booked one ticket. We still have to buy two more. But only four tickets are left on that flight. We can book depending on how fast you can arrange the cash. Do you have any money on you? I already told you, dude. I spent what I had on the bike. Okay, hang up. - Quick, dude. How much money can you spare? - I thought of asking you! Come and share a peg or two. But don't ask me for cash. He can't be trusted. They have sent only five thousand rupees. The ball is in our court now. I told you to drop them off. - I know what I should do. Just send the money. This is the coffin box. After a person dies, his body will be sent by flight in this. There are different types of coffin boxes based on each town. How much will it cost? Maybe around fifty thousand rupees. I hope you have money! Can I give you tomorrow? Sending it tomorrow, so pay me then. Tomorrow? We have to send them by tonight. The next flight is after four days. How is that possible? Today is a holiday. Sir, they are doing a post-mortem. Post-mortem is done 365 days a year. But embalming will not be done on holiday! It is the job of the Anatomy department in medical college to embalm the body. Sir, I heard that if you recommend, the Dean will sign the report. It doesn't matter who recommends it, she won't sign on a Deepavali day. Can the body be sent without embalming? Without embalming, airlift isn't allowed. Sir, they have come from North India. They haven't even dipped their feet in Rameshwaram. Try to do something, sir. - What can we do? I'll give you extra money if you want. This is my daughter's first Deepavali after her wedding. Still, didn't I come just because you called? Just not me, Dean won't sign today under anyone's recommendation. Those are the rules. Do you get it? Please come tomorrow. Bro, where is Chitrapandian? Hello, brother. I want to meet the Dean. Do you have an appointment? - No. She isn't well, I've been instructed not to allow any visitors. Look there, very urgent. At least find out from her. If I go in unnecessarily, she will yell at me. Hey, turn on the siren. We may get into trouble. Go. - Okay. Hey! Turn it off. Switch off the siren. What can I do if she is resting? All I did was obey orders. You go turn it off, please. If the dean gets to know, it will be a big issue. You at least turn it off. Sir, please tell them. Can you hear me? Please go inside and turn off the siren. I beg you. Turn it off. Sir, please. I'll lose my job if you trouble me like this. I lost my job. Hello, madam. What is the problem? - An ambulance is parked outside I can hear a siren. - They wanted to meet you. Why are you twiddling your thumbs? - I'll take care of it now, madam. Tell them to come in. - Sure, madam. Okay. Turning up to jinx my job! All because of my blessed fate! Bloody! Go inside. No help. Enacting a drama! If the gates aren't opened for you will you turn on the siren? Madam, we didn't know how else to contact you, please pardon us. I was briefed about you. That's why I am talking to you. None of the embalmers are in town. Go now and come tomorrow. It is possible if you set your mind to it. I'm also not feeling well. Even if I sign, the embalmer is not available. Please leave. - Madam. Tell me what should be done. I'll do it myself. Do you know what embalming means? We have to rip the stitches from the post-mortem. Remove the intestines, kidney and brain. Removed portions have to be stuffed with cotton. Make a hole in the thigh and through nerves, pump formalin chemical into the body. Eyes will burn. Finally have to restitch the body perfectly like before. No flight will accept if there is even the slightest mistake. What? Are you willing to do that? No, madam. - Come back tomorrow. What are you doing on a festive day, without even eating? Coming, mom. One ticket has been booked already! Where are we going now? As if you won't tell me if you knew! They are ganging up to make me mad. No one... I know no one will help me. I can't go back home. This is hell. Did I commit theft? Did I do something wrong? They are making me go mad using the government as an excuse. What did the government do? What is the government doing for the common man? I can't take my wife back in this birth! What the hell! Hey! Don't keep yelling in an alien language! Bad enough. We are wondering where to go! Asking me to sign here, there, everywhere. Stop the vehicle. Stop. Reverse the vehicle. Reverse, I say. Stop now. 'It is the job of the Anatomy department in medical college' 'to embalm the body.' Why are you not picking up the phone? Very few tickets left. Send the money soon. Okay, I'll call you later. Whom should I meet for embalming? - Mohan, take him to Venkatesh sir. Kanagu, what about the cash? - Trying to arrange for the money. Give me some more time. - Please do it fast. Hey. - Okay. Embalming can be done. Pay twenty five thousand rupees at the counter. The body can be embalmed. Sir, I was told the government centres charge only a thousand rupees. I don't have so much money. If you don't have money, it can't be done in private places. Sir. Dean asked if the staff was available then it can be done. If you have your staff, can you send them? It'll be very helpful. They are out of town, sir. Suresh. Annammal Medical College, Anatomy Department, madam. Can you sign now, madam? How long will embalm take? - Ninety minutes. Why are they insisting on embalming? Other passengers on the flight shouldn't get infected, right? Grandma, serve generously. I am the happiest to serve. Have your fill. Eat properly. - Hello, who is this? Sir, please bring the coffin box immediately. Bro, don't you understand? I got a signature from Dean. We are in medical college. Bring the coffin and come soon, sir. Tell me. Dude, I've transferred 20 thousand extra to your account. Book another ticket. Hey, I've also arranged for money. Let's book all the tickets. Super! Book for all three of them. Brother. Embalming. What is embalming? Nothing. Removing the stitches during post-mortem. Kidney, intestines should be removed. A chemical Formalin should be pumped in. The job will be over in an hour. - Hey! Are you all mad? Stop! Hey... - What happened? Durai has arranged a cash for buying the tickets. The coffin box is on the way. - Super, brother. So our problems are getting solved one by one, right? 'No embalming!' I've been watching all your drama. I won't allow this. I won't allow any more of this. 'From this morning, you have...' - Why is that man screaming? Let go. You can't embalm my wife. No! What happened? - He isn't allowing us to embalm. Hey, what's your problem? Only if all this is done, you can go back. Just ignore him. Let's wheel... - Move aside! Move! Have you gone crazy? Don't you get what I'm saying? Agreeing with the post-mortem, I have committed a huge sin. Why the hell can't you understand? You'll take the heart out, take the intestines out. And the kidneys, then the brain. How will I do the last rites for her? How will she go to heaven? How will her soul rest in peace? Which world are you living in? Hey! Move. Move aside. Even if I die, I will die, but I won't let the embalming happen. Go and die! Just die! Fine, one to talk of peace! You didn't let my mother live in peace even for a day. Now you are spinning a yarn about heaven after she has passed away? Huh? If you hadn't forced the driver to speed up, my mother would be alive today. She would be alive today. You murdered my mother. You killed her. You! These are strangers. They have been helping us the whole day. What did you do? As father and husband, what did you do? What have you done to date? Enough. Enough now! Enough. Just shut up. If you want to sit, do so. Otherwise, get lost! I can take my brother and mom back home, anyhow. Get out! Please take her inside. Come. Let's go. Mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Can we seal it? Brother. Let's go. Doctor, one minute. - What happened? One minute, ask them not to seal it. I'll be back right away. Here. Holy water from Rameshwaram. Holy water from Rameshwaram. Water from Rameshwaram! Sprinkle on her. 'If we bathe in the Holy springs there,' 'he will become a better person, dear.' Take ten copies of this. You'll need it at the airport. Sir, I have to pay you... - It's okay. Brother, do you believe in souls? A person who is alive may forget a good deed, but the soul will never forget. Just watch, this will change your life beyond your imagination. From now on, only good news will knock at your door! Hello? - 'Tickets not available.' 'Sorry.' 'I tried my level best. I couldn't get it, though.' 'What to do?' Okay, bring the cash to the airport. What is it? He couldn't get a ticket, it seems. Jinxed mouth! On top of it, he smiles! Let's go, brother. Come. - Hey! How do I break this news to them? 'What to do? We have to tell them.' Come, I'll take leave, sir. - It's okay, take care. Sir. Tickets aren't available. Huh? - No ticket. Your daughter has a ticket. You and your son didn't get the tickets. Brother. It's getting late. We can easily get them tickets if they are going by bus or train. We've never been to an airport. What do we do now? "Like a kite flying with the cool wind." "Like a kite flying with this cold wind." "This life is like a kite flying along with the cool wind." "Who can even tell the direction it will blow?" "How can what I saw now suddenly turn untrue somehow?" "Will I ever get back again the soul that left me in pain?" "We came all the way to see God. Instead, we lost our Goddess today." "Is our life just a hide-and-seek game every time?" "Am I the only witness on this earth in total distress?" "This life is like a kite flying along with the cool wind." "Who can even tell or know the direction it will blow." "I did not realise your value, dear when you were by my side here." "Now that I do, you are nowhere, dear." "Like a boat all alone in the sea." "My life is lost and lonely." "No punishment in this world can redeem my actions multifold." "Even if a flower blooms in water daily" "its fragrance mixes only in the air duly." "How strange fate can be!" "This heart wilts in sadness in love, lost and unexpressed." "Eyes well up with tears forlorn." "Even a flower blooms in a stone." Sonu! Sonu, what happened? Sonu. - Sonu, open your eyes. What happened to you? What is it? - Sonu. Brother. - Stop the vehicle. - Brother, stop. Stop. Sonu. Give me a hand. Look at him. What happened? - Get some water, brother. What happened? Brother. - Sonu. What is it? "Red ants queue up to carry a grain of rice in harmony" "marching to their home in solidarity." "Truth be told in reality." "I did not take care of my family. Not even like this tiny red ant." "Even if I set out on a pilgrimage as a good deed in my middle age." "Can I atone for my sins ever in this world, I wonder?" "Only today, for better or worse I see my face and my true colours." "Eyes well up with tears forlorn." "Even a stone hearted person is changed in time." "This life is like a kite flying along with the cool wind." "Who can even tell or know the direction it will blow." "How can what I saw now suddenly turn untrue somehow?" "Will I ever get back again the soul that left me in pain?" "We came all the way to see a God. Instead, we lost our Goddess today." "Is our life a just a hide-and-seek game?" "Am I the only witness on this earth in distress?" Where's the certificate? - In the ambulance. What, brother? - He's coming. Why is there a spelling mistake, sir? See this. Her name has been typed 'Janki' in the First Information Report. In the death certificate it is 'Janaki'. So what, sir? - How can you be so flippant? We are concerned about even the smallest of spelling mistakes. Different name means different person. It means you have hidden a dead person and bought some other corpse here. Are you serious, sir? I asked you this morning. You said if we miss this flight, the next flight is four days later. I agree. I did, but what can I do about this spelling mistake? Get me a proper certificate. - We are running short of time, sir. Air India will maintain this record for five years. We have to face the repercussions if there's any mistake. It's getting late. Go and rectify it. Sir. Sir. What happened? They won't allow it. - Why it seems? This document has a spelling mistake. Give it. - Hey! Come. - Wait. All this has to go to Lucknow. - Are you playing the fool? We sweated it out from the morning and got everything ready. You ask us to come tomorrow so coolly. - Get out of this room. Why should we go? We won't go until we send them back home. If a person from another state dies here. Red-tapism rules the roost, it's alright. But shouldn't you consider our plight having got everything ready, sir? You make trouble for those who are alive and you don't spare the dead, either. How will a spelling mistake affect the dead woman? What is the problem? In their certificate... - Sir. One minute, please step out and look at the bereaved family, then speak, sir. Come, sir. This is the daughter. Give me the paper. - Here. Did you do this in one day? - Yes, sir. Submit a declaration and you can take the deceased home. Thank you, sir. - Okay, thank you. Will you show your sincerity to them? Sorry, sir. Okay, go home. - Let me also stay. It was so good of you to have gone out of your way on Deepavali. Go home. - Okay. Let's go. - Yes, Brother. Where's your bike, brother? Who will lend money on a festival day? I didn't know what to do. I sold my bike. How could you do that? Don't feel bad. Nothing compared to this. I can handle it. See you. Let's go. 'The flight to Ahemadabad,' 'Gate number one from Chennai.' 'May I have your kind attention, please, ladies and gentlemen.' 'This is the security call for all passengers travelling on SpiceJet flight.' SG 611. 'Dad!' You'll be fine, dear. I won't leave you and go. - Don't be sad. Sorry, sir. Tickets are not available. Please wait. Madam, somehow... - Flight is fully booked, sir. Passengers are waiting, sir. Please listen to me. - No, ma'am. No chance of getting two seats. Please co-operate, sir. Next. I couldn't get tickets for them. What do you mean? No ticket. 'May I have your kind attention, please? Ladies and gentlemen.' 'Air India flight AI 4208 to Delhi' - Hey, give it. 'is now ready for departure.' - Have this. You have to take a connecting flight. Safe travel. I'll somehow send them soon. Do you understand what I'm saying? B... B... Brother. Please. My Shiv. Alone. No. Bro. - Let go. 'May I have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen.' 'This is the call for the flight 6E 7198 from Chennai.' 'May I have your attention, please, ladies and gentlemen.' 'This is the security call for all passengers travelling on' 'Spicejet SG 611 to Chennai.' Sir, boarding has already been announced. No Air India staff member is flying either to give up their seats. What can I do, sir? We don't know anything about Airport rules. It took time for us to get the death certificate. Sir, this flight is only up to Lucknow. To reach Ayothi, she has to travel another 135 km, sir. How can she shift her dead mother's body all alone? I am flouting rules. Listen to me. This is the passenger list. If two passengers give up their seats. You are lucky. I can't do anything more. - Thank you, sir. 'Attention passengers of Air India flight 4208 to Delhi.' 'Due to an emergency, a family is seeking your help' 'to travel to Delhi' 'If any two passengers is kind enough to' 'withdraw your tickets and help the family.' Hello, excuse me for one minute. Sir wants to talk to you. Please listen to him. This travel must be important in some way or the other to all of you. But she has lost a dear one. Unknown city. Unfamiliar language. Every single minute, she is here. She must be yearning to go back to her home town. And cry for her departed mother in her mother tongue. This is natural. If just two of you can give up your ticket for them. It will be a lifetime favour for them. Please. Please help them. Please. Just two tickets. I have enquired everywhere Their problem is genuine. And your help will be appreciated. No chance, sir. - Appeal once again. We've done our best, sir. What more can we do? My dear son. We are going to visit our grandson. It's our first flight experience. But that's alright. You take our seats. We'll go some other day. Brother? - They got tickets. Brother. - They got tickets to fly! Bring them here, quick. - Okay. Hey! Hindi! You got your tickets. Your ticket is confirmed. Confirmed? - Come. Come, my dear boy. Sister. Sonu! 'May I have your kind attention, please? Ladies and gentlemen.' 'Indigo announces the arrival of its flight, 6E.' How did you come here? Brother. What is your name? Abdul Malik! "When good people get together good deeds accumulate forever." "Every town and city will be a garden of love certainly." "Whatever one's religion may be," "whichever direction we travel daily." "When the language of love connects" "everything changes to shower a success." "Life teaches all of us for sure via ups and downs, pain and pleasure." "Faith is the key. If you believe anything might change." "Oh, mind, hold on to faith night and day." "Faith will unite you and me in our life in solidarity." "Love is the bridge that will connect to make our lives perfect." Brother. We will return to Rameshwaram. I don't know if it will be a pilgrimage. But I'll come to see my brother, Abdul Malik. Thank you. "Our lullaby for you." "Our minds and hearts bloomed anew" "with help from strangers we never knew." "Abdul Malik or Sitaraman may be the name." "It is the same." "Love is the key to peace and unity." "When hearts bloom in love-shower" "where do Gods and religions feature?" "In every heart will flow love as a spring, you know." "Tears are the true essence of love in every sense" 'Good evening, passengers.' 'This is your Captain Anburaj, speaking.' 'We are happy to welcome you on board...' God is the greatest. God is the greatest. My mother has passed away. I don't have money to cremate her. I was told you would help out. You'll have to face the police formalities and red tapism.
