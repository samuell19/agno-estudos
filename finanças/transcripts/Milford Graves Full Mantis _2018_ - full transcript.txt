My grandfather, uh, had, um... really cultivated the grounds, so it was already pretty good fertile ground by the time I... Well, my grandma died in 1970. We moved in, but I've been here all my life. So that... so that metal over there, that-that metal... particular display that I have, or p-piece of sculpture... [chuckles] That's Ogun. Iron man, you know. So that's ancient-- that was all my grandfather's stuff, so I didn't want to throw it away, and-and, uh... So I said, "Now, that's history man," and I couldn't keep it in a box, it wasn't doing no good, so I said, "Hey, Ogun, just hang it right up, man." [chuckles] [siren wailing nearby] Got to have the spirits, man. So, when I look at that, it just reminds me of the fact that... that those tools belonged to my grandfather, and all those tools was done to do work-- self-reliance work. So, every time I look at that, I say, "You know what? That's the way they used to do it." People grabbed a tool. And they had all these different tools. And there...

They were really complaining, man. Uh, and their-their complaint was that, uh, if you weren't Chinese, you wouldn't get into the inner core, man. So that started to hit me. I said, "Wow, man." So, if these guys have been studying that for a long time and they were on the... the outskirts of things, I said, "So, uh... I can't depend on, "you know, anybody that's very protective, culturally or ethnic-wise, of what they do." I said, "I think I'm going to have to evaluate "this whole situation of... in this... in this sense, "what is martial arts? What's kung fu? Where-where did it come from, man?" Well, I started reading books on Chinese martial arts, the history of this art and the history of that art. There was many times, man, when I was reading about this so-called grand master-- he'd be up in the mountains meditating, and he saw this and he saw that. I said, "Wow, I could do the same thing, man. I'll just go out in nature." 'Cause that's where they got it from. And I remember one guy, he was doing this, uh, praying mantis in Chinatown, and he got upset because, uh, he approached his teacher, and his teacher said that he wasn't allowed to teach certain things to non-Chinese. And I said... I said, "This is no good." And it was praying mantis, and he came and tried to show me some praying mantis. I said, "I'm going right to the praying mantis." That's the boss, not some human. So that's when I-I looked in the, uh, magazines-- this, uh, plant magazine-- and I saw a place where I could get these, uh... these praying mantis from, and I ordered them. I ordered them. I said, "I'm gonna let them go." And I watched them. And I watched all their moves. [laughs] So I went to the best teacher. I went to the praying mantis himself. And that was better than what any human can teach me, 'cause, see, if you go to... if you go to another human, he may have a limitation. Maybe he can't move a certain way, right? If he can't move a certain way, then that means I'm not going to get full mantis. I'm gonna get only a little bit of the mantis. But if I go to see all these different mantises, I'm getting the whole mantis, you know what I mean? I'm getting the... I'm getting the whole mantis, man, so... And then you turn it in. Then I converted it into how my joints could move. Maybe I couldn't move this certain way, but I'll get close to where the mantis... Then I would try to make it very practical by sparring a lot. Say, "Hmm, this works pretty good if I do this here. Lock up this way and twist around." I say, "That's pretty good." So that's how... [clears throat] that's how my stuff came. It came from going right to the source. [percussive music playing] When human folks want to shut you out because they don't like the way you look, they don't like the way you talk, or else they're very culturally or ethnically locked into their own set, then I'm going to say, "Well, what's the origin of what they do?"

[wooden xylophone music playing] ♪ [chanting vocalizations join in] ♪ ♪ [music ends] [atmospheric music droning] We're taught about measures. You know, we'll talk about pulse beats. All right, so we can count, "One, two, three, four," and so on. If you make the distance between one and two different from between two and three-- okay, the time length-- people say, "Hey, wait a minute, you're screwing up the tempo, man. You're out of tempo." So I've known some people say, "Well, you know, the best way to play in tempo is to get a metronome." Oh, my gracious. And forget about atomic clocks, now. Too exact, too exact. But you know what? The body, the heart, doesn't have the same time length, you understand, between each... each... each contraction and relaxation of the heartbeat. Ba-boom. The distance between ba-boom and the next ba-boom... if they are the same, that is extremely dangerous. And that's what they were missing before. They weren't... they weren't counting the time difference between there. So, if a doctor heard that and everything seemed to be clean, the more exact the time measures, the more dangerous it is. So now there's gotta be a time differential between every beat. You never see the exact same time. You're not supposed to see the exact time distance between each beat, each pulse beat. In other words, if you felt your-your pulse rate at your wrist or any other place other than listen to your heart, you're gonna hear that... [mimics thumping] They should be different. That's a healthy heartbeat. They can call that the chaos heartbeat. They can call that heart rate variability. That's why the word variability, that means the rate constantly varies. And all that people have to do is feel their pulse, and all of a sudden they count, they'll notice they're counting slower at one point, then they're counting a little faster. That's great, but if you count like a metronome, and everything's like bop... bop... bop, just like the second hand, that is extremely dangerous. That means your body is not responding. [chuckles] It must respond. You cannot walk across the street in-in-in military march, you know, on the beat per second, on a major high... on a major highway where traffic is coming. If no traffic coming, you could... you could... you could march with equal steps, but when you see big trucks coming, fast cars coming, you'll be moving all over the place. Your tempo's gonna start to change. You see, that's what the body expects. The body doesn't expect you to go and train it in a very metronomic way. So, what makes a person being able to swing, a person not being able to swing? I got a lot of compliments from a lot of those older guys, man. And I said, "You know, man, I'm not playing your typical dang, danga-dang, danga-dang, danga-dang," but they heard it. Like, there was dang... it was all in there, man. They heard it, man. So I said, "When you talk about this thing, swing, man," I said, "Swing, man... y-you know, swing, man, is getting you to move from one point to another point." It's putting life into you. You can't put a "dang, danga-dang" and call that the swing rhythm. Swing, it means, man, when you can feel, man, like, "Hey, man, I want to live to the next day." [atmospheric music continues droning] [music fades to thumping heartbeat] [heartbeat continues] [heartbeat continues] So I went to the, uh, Eastern School for Physicians Aides, and all you did for one year, all we did for one year, was just laboratory work. You know, we learned how to function as a person that can take a sample of blood or some tissue or whatever else and, you know, tell the doctors what's happening. So I did that, I completed that course, and I got my permit, and I wound up working for a veterinarian. So, I was the big guy at the lab. I was running this, and I was doing my thing for two years. So, during this time, on my lunch break, I used to go over to Barnes & Noble's on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue. I would always go into the, uh, medical section. So, one day, I'm looking around, and I looked in the cardiology section, and I see this recording. Said this, uh... "Heart Recordings" by Dr. Geckeler. I said, "Hmm, I wonder what this is about." And somehow, I just gravitated towards this recording. I got this recording, I took it home, and I listened. DR. GECKELER: The quality of a heart sound is important. Here is a mitral first sound which is sharp. [heart beating] GRAVES: And I picked up the phone, and I started calling other drummers. I said, "Wow." I said, "I got a recording here "that we don't have to go around begging no more "to so-called traditional people to teach us this or teach us that." I said, "I got a recording that... "it's-it's... it's got everything that we do, "that's supposed to be the so-called secret rhythms or possession rhythms or ritual rhythms." I immediately obtained a stethoscope, an electronic stethoscope. And I had an old reel-to-reel. No one can come to my house without having their heart recorded. So I was recording this on this reel-to-reel, uh, tape, you know, and... [heartbeat continues thumping] What happened was that I heard some heart sounds that wasn't on Dr. Geckeler's recording. I mean, I really heard some stuff that was just blowing me away. I said, "Wow." I said, "The heart really sounds like this?" Years went by, and years went by, and I was, you know, teaching this stuff, teaching that stuff, and I'm reading all these articles, and I'm up in Bennington. [electronic pulse buzzing] 1999-- I wanted to get more into my medical work again. I said, "I need an electrocardiogram machine." [electronic notes and pulses] So I was able to buy this equipment. I went and bought all these books, and I dug in. And I learned this system called LabVIEW. It's basically for scientists and engineers. And I started building all these things. And as usual, any kind of major invention, everything is by accident. I'm looking for one thing, and something comes up. And I said, "Wow, what is this?" And all of a sudden, I heard these melodic kind of sounds coming from, initially, the heartbeat that I inputted into the equipment. [electronic notes and pulses] So the first thing I do when people come in, I say, "Okay, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna... "I'm gonna... I'd like to get some information on you. "I want to see how you're vibrating inside. You know, how's your body oscillating?" [chuckles] So I go to the heart sound. [heartbeat thumping] I capture this kind of electrical data. Some people can call it chi, prana-- anything you want to call it-- but regardless of what you talk about, it is electrical activity in the body. So you capture this, transforming or converting this through a function generator. You know, this is all software-engineered. It gives us, through the different kind of voltage changes-- 'cause I be monitoring all the voltage changes... [deep electronic tone] In other words, what I be doing is not doing the typical way to what they be doing. All they're doing is a lot of times... when you hear "ba-boom, ba-boom," they're just getting the actual... the pulse, what we call the pulse beat, that something has taken place. Instead of going just like... [mimic-singing a slow heartbeat tone] ...it's this... [scats very fast and erratic heartbeat tune] I'm chopping that up. In that one line, some people go... [hums deep, droning tone] So you always had the drone. [humming along with deep electronic tone] But you're gonna break it up. [mimics fast beating] [mimics faster double-time beating] So that's what I'm doing: I'm getting little small shots, and I'm bringing some life to them. They're all present in the waveform. And what happened to me, I said, "Wait a minute." As I looked in the waveforms, I said, "Well, what about that little section there?" Okay? So, instead of taking a whole waveform, giving a whole waveform, like, a numerical value of one, well, what would it sound like if I ask to divide that one whole tone up into 50 parts? And each one of those 50 parts is going to have a different intensity or amplitude. It's got a different voltage level. And if I put it through a function generator that can now create these melodic types of sounds, what would it sound like? Tell you what. When you hear it, it speaks for itself.

Then we have the touch. Then we have the smell. Then we have the visual thing. The interesting thing about all of those different five receptors is that they're all converted into, uh, some people may want to say chi, chi or spiritual energy or cosmic energy. But in plain anatomical, uh, language, we're talking about the nervous system, as nerve impulses. And they all combine, they all combine.

So the visual thing is to say not only that you're seeing the structures; it's-it's giving you some sort of plant geometry.

And this was the worst time, 'cause that was the time the Black Panthers were around there, setting up police, shooting them, man. This guy took my head. Bam! Threw it up against the wall. The detective in there, man... So, people don't tell me nothing about what goes on in precincts. I know what I went through, man. They didn't even give me a chance, man. Said, "Is this your gun?" I said, "Yes, sir." I was just following all the rules, man. 'Cause I had to tell the truth. I say the best way to do it, I'm gonna tell the truth, man. You know? I was in a situation, man, protecting myself and blah, blah, blah. I ain't shoot nobody, man. [heartbeat thumping] I go to court, go to court, go to court, go to court, man. So my lawyer would always say we could, you know, work it out, though. We wasn't prepared, blah, blah, blah. So this went on for two years, man. Two years, man. I said, "Wow, this is gonna be rough, man." This final court appearance, man, this was gonna be it. And I said, "Man, shit, man, this next one, man," I said, "this guy may give me time, man." And I'm going against, they say, the roughest judge in Brooklyn who don't mess around. He gives you time, man. So, anyway, now it gets to the... the final situation. There was a place called the Cheese of All Nations on Chambers Street in Manhattan. So... It's always crowded. So I go down on a Saturday, and Monday was my court appearance, man. And I'm trying to go down there and get me some cheese. That's when I was eating cheese, man. Enjoyed me some sheep cheese, some, you know, goat cheese. I said, "I'm gonna enjoy myself, man, "'cause I may not be able to get no... no-none of this cheese in the jailhouse, man." So... I'm on line, and it's packed in there, man. It's packed, man. And so this guy is standing next to me, man. I'm... I started talking to this guy, and I'm saying, "You know, "there's a more efficient way that this place could operate if they had this and they had that." So the guy says, "I agree with you." And then, after that, my number was called, and I said... said, "It was nice talking to... talking to you, sir." "It was nice talking to you, too." I said, "All right, maybe I'll see you again." So, anyway, I got my cheese and walked out. So I go to court Monday, man, that Monday, and my lawyer, man, he goes over to the prosecuting district attorney, man. And all of a sudden, my, uh... my lawyer leaves the guy. He's coming to me, smiling like this. He said, "Guess what. "The prosecuting attorney you was talking to, "district attorney, he was the guy you was talking to at the Cheese of all Nations." [laughs] So he looked at me and did like that. I looked at him, did like this, and he looked at me, man. They had a conference with the judge, and the judge said, "Well, it was probably a little old misunder... blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." He said, "Unconditional discharge." Then, when I got my fingerprints, man, they said, man, "I don't know what happened here," he said, "but that guy doesn't let nobody go, man." I said, "Judge, you will never see me in here again. I'm sorry for everything that took place, man." And you know what? I think what was really behind that, man, the reason I went out-- I didn't go out like a thug. I went out because there was lack of response in that community, man, when you reported a crime, man. No one really cared, man. You know, you're in a predominantly African-American, Hispanic, uh, community, man. I think there was a greater spirit that was inside, man. How is it possible, man, that of all those people and I'm talking to the guy who was gonna... You know what I mean? So, what that did to me, it said, man, you know, you don't know who you talking to. You know, be nice at all... it doesn't hurt to be nice and be a human being, man.

[grunts] [electronic tone humming] [vehicle passing] [electronic tone continues] [melodic electronic tones] [melodic electronic tones continue] [melodic electronic tones continue] [droning electronic hum] [electronic hum stops] There's certain ways when you vocalize, man. You've got to do certain things. You know what I mean? So, if-if I say a, uh... if I say, "Ah," if I'm doing "ah," if I'm doing, like, a... "beh" or "dah," you know? 'Cause if I say, like, "Beh, beh," you tasted bitter food. "Beh, beh, beh." You got to see the anatomy that's involved and what that taste does. A sour taste... [clicking tongue, grunting] [clicking tongue] Now, when you make... if you do certain kind of... you know, pronounce certain kind of vowels or consonants, pay attention, man, to-to the whole anatomical structural setup. [grunts, sighs] That's sweet for me. "Ah, mm, ah." You know, "Ah." So you get down into that pitch level. So that's how I-I put that off and I translate it. The different tastes, man, to the different notes, man. One of the publications I was reading, man-- it's a thing, like, well, why does minor scales... why does... why are they... why are they related to sadness and melancholy, man? And why is the major ones to, like, joy, happy and up and all that there? And... And I figured I'd won out by playing with theautonomic nervous system. Okay? So, if you're going to go to the so-called yang side, if you're going to go to... That's the sympathetic nervous system. You're going to mess with your adrenaline. That's the more aggressive side, man, like this here. Okay? You go the yin, the yin side, or theparasympathetic side, that's more of your reduced side, you know, your easy side. Now, they both can check each other. Okay? It's too much, then something gottacome and say, "We have to lessen it. We'll give you less." Sadness... can be related to crying. People sad, they go through, they cry, they feel all down, they be crying, man, you know, like and so on. Crying is related... uh, uh, is related to your tear ducts. You secrete fluid from your tear ducts. Secretion from the tear ducts is stimulated by the parasympathetic nerves. That's the yin thing. That's parasympathetic. Now, what you have to learn how to do, man-- and this is important-- that's what I was telling you earlier-- when you find that you're getting toosympathetic inside, man, you have to not so much cry, but you have to stimulate your tear ducts. Once you stimulate your... your tear ducts, man, you'll start to stimulate... you have to activate the parasympathetic nervous system. That's the calming effect. But it can't be excessive. Okay? 'Cause excessive... excessive yin, as they say, will turn into yang. That's the protective part of the body. It's gonna kick in, man. The adrenaline's gonna kick in. In order to cause secretion from your tear ducts, man, anatomically, you have to do certain things up... in the upper part here, man. You see? The cheek bones-- right on up here. Temple area. And you... and it's a way you drop down inside, man, you just go inside, man, you just... You got to roll your eyes just a little bit, man. You go down and... [sighs] See, and I'm starting to lubricate my eyes now. You can't see that far away. Yeah, see, I-I've got... I brought tears in my eyes here. I just excited my sympathetic nervous system. So, if you gonna go... [melodic vocalizing] [strained vocalizing] ...as soon as you go in between, you understand, you're getting into that semitone and going to a more minor thing. [strained vocalizing] You have to use the same... muscle and nerve involvement, man, that's used to create tears. [laughs] You see? So, naturally, when the ear hears that, man, the human being is also responding to that, man-- that tone. They're hearing that tone, and they're saying it inside. So, what it does is stimulate the same yin apparatus. That's my theory on what the... what the heck is happening, man, what minor tones is about, man. [vocalizing minor tones] And that's the other thing. Check this out. [vocalizing minor tones] You see, they start coming out even more now over here. ♪ I got soul ♪ I feel so good ♪ It's so good to me ♪ Uh, yes, I have the blues. That don't do nothing, man. I'm down here... ♪ I got the blues. [vocalizes minor tones] One is taking... the sympathetic takes it more on here. You understand? It doesn't take it up into this area here, man. So it's a whole big thing with major and minor, man. Major intervals are too wide. You're not stimulating that apparatus-- that neuromuscular apparatus that stimulates tear glands. Any time there's a tear, the body knows, man, that it's coming to a mode to protect you, man, from getting... [growls] [growling]: Like this here, like this here. So, when you're all charged up like this here, man, you got to know to go back down. And it may even take going back and singing that... [vocalizing minor tones] Over the last few years, I have really involved myself in polymeter playing, playing of different kind of meters. In other words, different feelings. It's different feelings I'm about. This is doing one feeling. This is doing another feeling. In other words, this may be doing a sad feeling. This may be doing, like, a happy feeling. Sometimes almost like a contradiction that you set up with inside. And it's not only twofold, where they're talking about the two parts of the brains. It's multifold. Because, see, that simple type of sadness may produce, like, just subdivisions of that sadness that takes on all different kind of degrees of sadness. See, it may be sadness 'cause somebody told you that there was death. It may be sadness because you broke your favorite dish. It's all sadness, but different types of sadness, but lumped up as just one big sadness.
