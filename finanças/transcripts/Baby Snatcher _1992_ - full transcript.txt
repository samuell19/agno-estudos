Cal? Cal. Baby. (GRUNTING) What? What is it? (EXHALING) I can't take this anymore. What? Tell me. I'll make it better. I can't breathe. You're taking up all the air. I feel like I'm drowning. I don't understand. I can't stay here. Not cut out for this anymore. I tried. Maybe I didn't. I don't know anything anymore. I just know that I don't wanna be married. Not anymore. Not to you. Tell me what I can do. There has to be something. Tell me! You can't do anything. It's already done. I filed for divorce three days ago. I'm sorry. (GASPING) Cal! Get back in the house. It's 1:00 in the morning. I don't wanna put on a show for the neighbors. I'm pregnant. (LAUGHING) Oh, boy. That's pretty damn convenient. Not for me! I'm 38. I wouldn't humiliate myself with a 17-year-old's line if it wasn't the... Forget it. Let me know where to send your things. Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. Why are you telling me this now? I just found out this week. When was I going to tell you, Cal? Between battles? You know what my CO would say if I divorced a pregnant woman? It's none of his business! Yeah, right. I'll be sure to tell him that when he puts in my efficiency rating that I walked out on my unborn child. You have to do what you have to do, Cal. Like being in a damn spider web. Please don't go. I don't feel well. Oh, sweetheart, I know. Oh, oh, come here. JENNY: Here's your lipstick, Mama. I know, but I have to go to work, okay? I'll tell you what though. I'll give you a call at lunch time. Huh? Would you like that? Oh, I know. Better yet, why don't you call me, hmm? That'd be fun, wouldn't it? No, I want you to stay. Wanna give me a call? Why can't you stay? JENNY: Hurry, Mama. Oh, sweetie. Oh, Karen, you shouldn't be packing that boy around. He's too heavy. Okay. Now remember, Mom, he needs his eardrops in about half an hour. And he can't take any medicine on an empty stomach, so give him, like, half an apple or something before he takes his aspirin. I've got your sweater, Mama. (CAR HORN HONKING) It's David, Mama. Okay. Oh, thanks. Got the other one? There we go. (HONKING CONTINUES) RUTH: Hurry, Karen. It wouldn't do to inconvenience David. Now remember, you call me at lunch or I'm gonna be very unhappy. And you? You wait for me. Okay. I'm gonna pick you up after school. (HONKING) What are you honking for? (GIGGLING) In a hurry. Gotta get to work. Oh. You just couldn't wait to have a kiss, could you? Just hang a big sign on the house that says "Honk if you want a kiss." (HONKING) Shh! My mother is watching. How'd she get out here so early? On her broomstick? No. I sent her an SOS. My babysitter called in sick, so... Don't insult my mother. She saved my life. So, do you want me to open it? Oh, that's for me? Don't be coy. What is it? Christmas? Why are you always buying me things, Karen? Well, I didn't buy this. I made it. God, Karen. What do you mean, "Oh, God, Karen"? It's beautiful. You made that? You knitted that yourself? Yes. With my own two hands. I think the colors are perfect. When am I gonna wear it? Oh, come on. You can wear this anywhere. At home, at work. That way you'll have to think about me. Karen, I... All right, not at home. It's just that I never wear anything that beautiful, especially at work, you know? People will notice. And maybe say something to your wife. I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I forgot. Can you come by tonight? I hope I can. I'll call you. (MAN ARGUING) I would not go in there if I were you. Keeley was late again. And she's getting canned in a very loud way. Great. I was going to ask for an extra week on my maternity leave this morning. Cute. Who was he? Oh, um... He's just a friend from in town. My car's in the shop, so he drove out, gave me a lift. You should've called me. I live so close. Oh, thanks. But, you know, I didn't want to bother you. I don't mind, we're friends. (SOBBING) Hey, I'm not paying you to sit out here and court lung cancer, Diana. You're late, Karen. I'm sorry. Kevin has an ear infection. Three times in two weeks. I know, I'm sorry. Hey, things are rough all over. Look, I hired you because I needed a reliable store manager and you needed a job. Upfront, you asked for a month's maternity leave and I gave it to you. Now all this stuff is not part of the deal. You either get it together or you get out. End of story. So... Conflict. Not with your mother or your brother or your boyfriend or like, between nations. But inside yourself, feeling two things at the same time. It's all right, you know. Everybody does it. There's a wonderful book about teenagers and how they feel about their parents. It's titled, Go Away I Hate You! (ALL LAUGHING) But in smaller print, "But first drive me and Connie to the movies." Huh? (LAUGHING) See? Anger and desire to run at the same time with love and dependency, which probably brings us back to anger, which conflicts with love, and so it goes, in circles. One mother I know has a big sign she holds in front of her when her teenagers are starting to give her some grief. "So why don't you leave home since you already know everything?" (LAUGHING) You think that mother really hates her kids and wants them to leave? Yeah. (ALL LAUGHING) All right, quick. If there are any mothers or daughters here who are angry about anything... All right, all right. What is it? Come on. Nothing. (LAUGHING) Come on. Are you pregnant? (LAUGHING) Hi, Momma. How was your day, pal? It was okay. Just okay? Tracy Miller is having a Halloween party this Saturday. Well, that sounds like fun. I wasn't invited. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I know it's hard changing schools, being the new girl. But you'll meet people, you will. Hey, you know what I was thinking? Remember my prom dress? Mmm-hmm. Well, what do you say we get it out, we get the scissors, and we make a great new dancing outfit for your Barbie. (MUSIC PLAYING) (BOTH LAUGHING) (LAUGHING) (PHONE RINGING) I'll get it. Hello? David. Mom, it's David. Thank you. Hello. Hi. Are we gonna... Yeah. Uh, that's okay. No, of course, I understand. Is David coming? Here we go. We're gonna to get you so fit, you'll scare yourself. I don't... (SIGHING) I don't feel so well. I guess that's why they call it morning sickness. (RETCHING) I'm leaving. I'll see you tonight. ALL: Two. Three. Four. Five. (COUNTING CONTINUES) (SIGHS) Cal will like ponies. Men like ponies. Ponies are perfect. (GASPS) Oh, great. That's great. And nobody cleans up the table round here anymore? (SNIFFING) Smells like a paint factory around here. Bianca! Could've cracked a few windows. Bianca. You planning on cooking dinner tonight or am I supposed to make it myself? Crying out loud, I'm supposed to pay for all this stuff. Oh, my God. Bianca? I need a doctor, quick! Somebody get me a doctor. Well, there is a new one. Get out of my way, you little jerk! I'm Captain Hudson. This is my wife. She's four months pregnant. She fell off a ladder. It's all right now. Everything will be fine, Captain. Just let us do what we're paid to do. Hello there. Welcome back. I'm Dr. Beinart. Cal? Cal's fine. I wish I could say the same for you. What kind of tests have you done on me? Where's my husband? We sent him home to get some fresh clothing for you. Mrs. Hudson, you are very sick. I won't play games with you. This fall you took from the ladder... I didn't really fall, I got dizzy, that's all. I got down all right. I've been throwing up a lot lately. It's... It's the morning sickness. No, it isn't morning sickness, Mrs. Hudson. I wish it were that simple. Look, the vomiting, the dehydration, the dizziness, blackouts? They're all signs of acute diabetes. Nah. No, that's not possible. You've probably been borderline for years and now it's becoming dangerously severe. Well, this isn't the Middle Ages. Surely this is something you can control? Well, that's true, Mrs. Hudson, but your husband tells us you're four months pregnant, and given the severity of your condition, well, I'm not at all sure you can carry a healthy baby to term. What are you saying? That I should terminate my pregnancy? I want you to be prepared for the likelihood that there could be damage to the fetus. And until we run some tests, we just won't... No. You don't understand. This baby is very important, I can't lose this baby. Come on now. We don't have to cross that bridge until we get to it. Hmm? Even in the worst-case scenario, this doesn't have to be the end of your childbearing. We get you back on your feet again, 100 percent, there is no reason why you can't try again, in a year or so. (SOBBING) I don't have a year. I want to see my husband, I want to see Cal. All right, all right. All right, all right. I'll go see if he's back. Doctor. Don't tell him, please? That's my place. All right. But, Mrs. Hudson, your husband needs to know, and soon. (SOBBING) (SOBBING) CAL: Bianca? I brought you some sweats and a squadron T-shirt that you like to, uh... Something comfortable. I couldn't find a suitcase. Did you talk to Dr. Beinart? He said you needed to talk to me. Did he say why? Bianca, I don't even know why you wanna see me, after the way I behaved. God, you know, um... When I saw you lying on the floor, you looked so breakable. I just realized for the first time there's a life inside. An actual life. And... I wanted it. I want the baby. I sort of made a promise to God that, um, if you got through it and the baby survived, that I'd be a good father. Or learn how to be. Oh, God. This whole thing scares the hell out of me. I sound like a jerk. But this stuff... Not very good at it, I guess. Never will be. You're fine. And I'm fine. And our baby's going to be fine too. You need this baby like you need more bad luck. Don't give me that look. I've been looked at harder by meaner monkeys than you. Mom, if you didn't wanna help, why don't you just say so? Did I say that? What I said was two kids are enough. And you with no husband. I had a husband. And now you have somebody else's husband. How is Mrs. Anderson? I don't know, Mom. You tell me. You seem to know so much more about my life than I do. I know I didn't raise my daughter to sleep around with married men. Jenny, sweetheart, please would you take Kevin outside to the backyard to play before it gets too cold? But, Mama, we wanna help. Please. Before the sun goes down. KEVIN: Mama, why can't we help? Don't you ever talk like that in front of my kids again. Do you hear me? I suppose half of Saratino heard you. I don't know why it's worse for me to say it than for you to shack up... You see? That is why I moved out here. To keep you and all these other busybodies... (SIGHING) Mom, I'm not stupid. I know how this looks. But David's love for me is just something that... If he loves you so much, why hasn't he married you, huh? Did he pay for any of this? Has he paid for anything? How does he expect you, let alone your baby, to survive on what you make at that pizza joint? It's not that simple. He doesn't wanna hurt her. Besides, he's got his kids to think about. It's just not that simple. Karen, I can take everything except your being a fool. If you got pregnant thinking to bring David to heel, then you are in for nothing but hard times. You mark my words. BIANCA: And I don't think you understand the depth of my husband's religious convictions, or mine for that matter. We simply can't accept abortion as an option, Dr. Beinart. So these tests are totally unnecessary. Besides, I know my baby is perfectly healthy. DR. BEINART: Mrs. Hudson, you have to believe me when I tell you we could be talking about a severely impaired child who would never lead... (SIGHING) Mrs. Hudson, I feel it's my duty to speak directly with the Captain. Captain Beinart, I'm keeping the baby. And I don't think your commanding officer would like to hear that you tried to coerce a couple into doing something against their religious principles. Of course not. No, I didn't think so. (TELEVISION PLAYING) KAREN: Can't be right. (SIGHING) It just can't be. Oh, where does this all go? Where does this all go? (SIGHING) DAVID: Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! JENNY: Mama, come look. KEVIN: David, what's in the bag? What's in the bag? DAVID: Catch it, here. Mama, look at the tree David brought. It's beautiful. What would I do without you? DAVID: Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho! KAREN: Okay, okay. JENNY: Wow, she's beautiful! One, two, three, show time. Wow! Yay! Looks great, huh? Hey. You feel that? What? Uh-oh. Restless. What's that? Speak up, I can't hear you. Oh, she says the food is good, but she needs a bigger apartment. (LAUGHING) Merry Christmas. Mom. Grandma! (LAUGHING) I didn't know you were coming. Since when do I need an appointment to see my daughter? Mom, please don't do this. Guess I'll be heading home, Karen. You don't have to go. It's getting late. You got another tree to trim, David? Why do you have to do this? Is it my fault I don't like to see my daughter being used by... He's not using me. He loves me. And I love him. Why can't you just accept that? Oh, yeah. Merry Christmas. This guy, he's coming down, he's coming down, and then he puts up the hook and then he bounces off and misses the cable. Then he goes up and goes back around and then comes back in and then he's barely got enough room to make another pass. About six and a half, actually. Six and a half months? Are you serious? Well, actually, it's closer to seven. I don't believe you. (CHUCKLING) Those ankles. They're miniscule. They don't exist. And look at that belly. I'm bigger than I look. It's the dress. It, uh, covers a multitude of sins. Oh, you couldn't have hidden my belly under a circus tent by seven months. Isn't that so, Russ? Hey, Russell. You say something, honey? (CHUCKLING) I tell you, it's like they're from a different planet. Some questions better left unanswered. (LAUGHING) Anything dealing with a woman's weight falls into that category. Hey, Cal! Two and half months to go. You must be getting to be quite the hand at "pant and push." Lamaze. Are you saying you escaped the natural childbirth hell? Well, er... I guess I just didn't see the point. And you told Bianca that? Well, no. Well, actually she said fine. MAN: Fine? Oh, man, some guys have all the luck. (LAUGHING) Who did you say your OB-GYN is? Captain Miller? Uh, no. A townie actually. Good for you. Some things just aren't Air Force, like stirrups and oddly placed mirrors. (ALL LAUGHING) I always wanted a town doctor, but Clark said, why pay for what you can get for free? You're a lucky one to have a husband like Cal. I tell myself that every day. Are you sure the doctor said it was okay for you to be so cold all the time? Maybe I should turn up the furnace. No, don't do that, you'd bake. You know you hate it when it gets above 60. Yeah, but I'm not pregnant. Really, I'd rather just bundle up. Artificial heat gives me terrible headaches. Since when? Since I got pregnant, goose. You know how pregnant women get. Be thankful I'm not sending you out into the dark for rocky road and kosher pickles. (LAUGHING) Well, if you did need anything for the baby, you would tell me, right? What's the matter, Cal? This natural childbirth thing. Do you think it's something, uh, that we should do? Do you think it would be better for the baby? I mean, do you wanna do it? Do you? Yeah, I would. Cal, you'd hate those classes. Fat women panting like old dogs in August. (GROANS) (BOTH LAUGHING) Yeah, but I would though. You get squeamish when I cut up a fryer. You let me take care of this, hmm? I wanna make love. I know what Dr. Beinart said about the diabetes and all that, but... Hmm. You look pretty good. Cal? Hmm? It wouldn't be safe. Not for the baby. (SNIFFLES) All right. Cal? Go to sleep. Atta girl. DOCTOR: Good. Come on. You can give me one more push. Give it to me now. Atta girl. Atta girl. Come on, baby. Come on. That's it. That's it now, come on. Come on, it's coming! One more push. Come on! There you go, Karen! (LAUGHING) Good! That's it. That's it. Yeah. (BABY CRYING) (RUTH LAUGHING) Look at that! There you go, Karen. Say hello to a brand new, healthy daughter. Sweetheart. Oh, Sophie, hello! (LAUGHING) God, she looks like Grandpa Munster. (RUTH LAUGHING) Oh, sweetheart. She's so beautiful. About ready? I need to take Sophie back to the nursery soon. Well, could I keep her a little while longer? I'm expecting someone. All right, but just a few minutes more. The other babies are all going down for the night. Besides, visiting hours are almost over. Hi, Karen. Hi. Looks like I'm a little late. It's okay. Well, do you want to hold your baby daughter, Mr. Anderson? (BABY CRYING) Oh, isn't she beautiful? She will be beautiful. She takes after her mommy. This is crazy. Come on, Karen. Karen, not now. Come on. God, I thought you would take one look at Sophie and just melt. I thought you would decide right on the spot that you had to stay. You know that's impossible. At least right now, and I've never promised you more than I could give you. I am going to love this baby. You'll see. You're gonna miss all her firsts. Her first step, her first word, her first date. Her first broken heart. (SOBBING) Hudson! Cal! It's a good thing I caught up with you, or the wife would have my head. Now that the holidays are out of the way, Lindsey and some of the other officers' wives wanna throw a baby shower for Bianca. Truth is, I think they feel a little guilty for not having one sooner. Anyhow, what I'm supposed to find out from you is, you know, what's a good day? Uh, Bianca's due soon, isn't she? Due? Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLING) Right. Shower, huh? Yeah, you know, punch, cookies, really stupid games. There's this is one with cotton balls and a wooden spoon. It's tribal. Anyway, check with Bianca, get back to me ASAP so that I can get the Commander-in-Chief off my back. CAL: Okay. (SIGHING) I'm sorry. I just don't see the point. This baby already has everything it could possibly need for the next 10 years. Bauer is the head of my department. And if his wife wants to give you a baby shower... If he wants to adopt you, I'm not gonna say no. But I don't really know her. None of those women. I'd feel silly, awkward. Well, I'm gonna feel a damn sight more silly if Bauer gets down on my case. And we're just talking about a baby shower here, it's not the end of civilization as we know it. Give me a date. Here, taste this, it's your favorite. Get out of here with that! Now you're making an idiot out of me. Cal, this isn't like you. Look. I don't like being in the dark. I got no dates, no info. Look, how can you get so excited about a shower when you don't even know what a shower is? I don't give a diddly-squat about a baby shower! I wanna know the date, the due date. When the hell is my baby coming? February. Wow. Well! (CHUCKLING) I guess that narrows it down. That gives us 28 options. The 20th, the 21st, it's not an exact science. Okay. 20th. 21st. There it is. In case you change your mind, you know? (TELEVISION PLAYING) (KAREN SINGING LULLABY) (CONTINUES SINGING) MAN: Mrs. Hudson, all our clients stress privacy in the matter of adoption. You and the captain appear to be perfect candidates for the kind of work that we do. How soon? Well, these things take time, but in your case, I wouldn't be surprised if you were up to your elbows in diapers within the year. A year? But I need, uh... I was thinking maybe a week or two. Three at the most. Look, uh... I can make it worth your while. Mrs. Hudson, you're very kind, but I think we'll pass on that. Of course, if you'd like to find... KAREN: Okay, great. So all the numbers will be by the telephone in the kitchen, okay, and Jenny and Kevin know where everything is. (LAUGHS) MRS. JOHNSON: Oh, that will be fine. Oh, perfect. Then I'll see by 7:00 on the 19th. Yes. Thanks, Mrs. Johnson. Bye. Bye-bye. Thank you. RECEPTIONIST: Can I help you? Uh, no. No, thank you. Ma'am? Ma'am! You forgot your flowers. And the children are how old? Three and five. Yes. That is when they start to be fun, but I'm better with infants. Thank you, though. (ALARM RINGING) (ALARM STOPS) Sweetheart, can you just stay still for a minute? Oh, come on! Kevin, Kevin, that's enough. (SIGHS) Mom, I know what you said. I thought this time I had finally found a reliable babysitter. Well, for crying out loud, she looked like Aunt Bea. Yes, I asked for references. I can't miss work. Mom, it's my first day back. I have to open. I can't lose this job! Mom, I know you said you didn't want to spend the rest of your life babysitting grandkids, but I have nobody else to call. Mom, please? (CAR DOOR OPENS) Come on, Mom, I gotta go. Look, the ad is still running, so if anybody calls about it, just set up an interview, talk to them, just try and give me a couple to choose from, all right? Ooh, you trust my judgment that far? Mom! Here. There you go. Got her? Okay, great! Thanks. Hello, sweetie... Pretty girl, yes. Oh, I'm going to miss you, sweetheart. Look, I'll be back at noon to nurse her. And she felt a little warm this morning, so can you keep an eye on that? And if, uh, she starts running a fever, just be sure... And go all to pieces. Good heavens, Karen! I have raised more than a few kids to voting age. Cut Granny some slack, okay? Oh, Sophie, wanna say goodbye to Mama? Want to say, "Bye-bye, Mama"? Come on, let's go say, "Bye-bye, Mama." (PHONE RINGING) (CAR ENGINE STARTING) Williams. Yes, about the ad. Yes? Yes, the job is still open. Newborn. Well, four weeks, that's about as close as you can get, right? No, that's fine. I have a map. Now that's 10:30, yes? Mmm, that's right. Lang, Marcy Lang. Yes. I'll see you then, Mrs. Benson. (GROWLING) Such a pretty boy. Oh, my Karen makes pretty kids, there's no denying that. The older one, Jessie? (CHUCKLES) Jenny. That's right, Jenny. She's in the first grade now? Yes, she'd be in no trouble. She goes to school at 7:30 and doesn't get home until... Oh, Marcy, these references! I don't know if my Karen can afford you. Well, it's... It's really not a matter of the money. I love babies, children. Babysitting gets me out of the house for a few hours. (PHONE RINGING) Want to see the nursery, Marcy? Oh, I need to get that. Would you mind holding her? Not at all. I'd love to. Williams. Yeah. Uh-huh. That's right. Full time, three kids. I think the job may be taken, but hold on a minute. I'll write that down for Karen. Uh-huh? Yeah. Uh-huh? KEVIN: Come on, you'll like it. We helped Mom pick it up. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. Right. All right. We have a lot of new things for the baby. She put my pictures on all the walls. I think I'll give Sophie all my dinosaurs. Marcy, are you coming? All right. All right, Lewis. I'll have her call you. Yeah, okay, bye-bye. (CAR DRIVING AWAY) Kevin! Kevin, do you have Sophie? No, Gran. Marcy's got her. (PHONE RINGING) Diana? Diana, could you get that? (PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) Miranda's Pizza. Hey, Karen, it's your mom. Probably lost the TV remote. Yeah, Mom. Mom, call 911. Mom, call 911. I'll be right there. So did you tell her, or are you going to make her suffer? I have to go. Hey, we open in half an hour. I have to go. What about the lunch cooks? I can't cook. I don't even know how to fire the ovens! God, please let her be fine. Please just let her be there. Please! MAN: Up along that fence. Dig over there. Karen, I'm so sorry. I can't believe... You can't know, she was so nice... (SOBBING) I thought we'd struck gold. What are they doing here? I don't understand this. I'm afraid it's standard procedure in cases like this, Mrs. Williams. Cases like this? What does that mean? Why are these people digging up my front yard? Why aren't they out looking for my baby? We put an APB out on a woman using the description your mother gave us, along with a description of the car. RUTH: I can't believe this. I can't believe any of it. She was so nice, so well-dressed and so clean. When the phone rang, it was the most natural thing in the world to ask her to hold the baby. You have to understand, Mrs. Williams, it's our experience in cases like this that the baby wasn't taken by an outsider but by a person who knew... You just gave my baby to a total stranger? What? Some woman you've never seen before in your life? No, but Karen, I told you. She... She was so clean and her smile, Karen, she had the loveliest smile... Did you ever love her, Mom? Did you ever love her? Did you ever think of her as one of your own grandchildren? Like Jenny or Kevin? I love Sophie! Did you, Mom? You never... Mrs. Williams, if I could just ask you a few questions. I don't know anything. Oh, God! How am I going to tell David? I can just tell you the demographic spread. The sheer numbers of people we can reach who have no access at all to high-tech medical procedures. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, I hate to interrupt. David, there's a call for you. Now? Just... I think maybe you'll want to take it. Now. I'm sorry. Just excuse me a moment. Why didn't you tell me about this? Why didn't you trust me? Let go of me, Kurt. David. David, what do you call this? You call this making a decision? The receptionist? Karen Williams? You're going to wreck your life and everything we've built together for a receptionist? That's why she quit. Because you knocked her up. Great! Good thinking all around. I ought to take you to... You're my boss, Kurt. You do what you have to do. I'm not your boss. I'm your friend! That's what kills me. You stonewall me for months, then you drop a bomb like this Karen Williams thing. Karen Williams thing? Some weirdo kidnapped my baby, you get it? She stole my little girl. Why didn't Anne tell me about this situation? Why did you guys shut me out like this? Because Anne doesn't know yet. And you're going to go public with this? I beg you, buddy. Don't, David. Think! When people find out about this little love nest of yours, you're through! You're not going to look good no matter how you handle this. You said you were at work when the baby was taken. Can anyone substantiate that? The airport lead didn't pan out. I'm sorry, what? You said you were at work when the baby was taken. Can anyone substantiate that? You know, I don't understand. My mother told the police exactly what happened. I have told you everything I know. What are you people still doing here? Why don't you go out and find my baby? David. I'm sorry, I should have been here. Ah! Enter the boyfriend. Who are you? DePaul, FBI. What are you doing to find Sophie? All we can, Mr. uh, Anderson. Mr. Anderson, what does your wife think about your little arrangement with the... What the hell does that have to do with anything? My wife... Is also a possible suspect. That's crazy. She doesn't know anything about us. She doesn't! I mean, one of the reasons I moved here when I first got pregnant was to keep things private. Private. Uh-huh. Maybe your wife wanted you to believe that she was in the dark. Did you ever think about that? That's ridiculous. There's not a deceitful bone in the woman's body. You mean to stand there and tell me that the thought never crossed either one of your minds that she was the one who did this? Hey, Hudson, someone kick your dog? Something wrong? No, uh... Bianca had the baby. A baby! Well, all right, Air Force, all right! (ALL TALKING EXCITEDLY) Boy or girl? Uh, she had a girl. You're sure? Now, now that's fantastic! Boys ain't worth spit. Aren't we proof of that, huh? (ALL LAUGHING) How's Bianca doing? Er, she's fine. A little tired and glad to be home, I guess. Oh, well, wait a sec. She had a baby today and they already let her go home? Well, that's what she said. Uh, she's always been a very strong woman. I guess so. Did the hospital give her a bed, or just a bullet with directions to the nearest bush? (ALL LAUGHING) She said her water broke at work and that's all I know, so... I guess I got to go home. Thanks. ALL: Congratulations! Someone win the lottery? Bianca had a baby. A little girl. That is one tough cookie. Bianca! Bianca. Bianca! Don't you want to see your baby girl, Captain Hudson? (BABY CRYING) She has my mother's eyes. You don't have to go through with this. Look at you! Look what it's doing to you. You heard Lieutenant Thompson. He said that sometimes this is... I don't give a damn what Lieutenant Thompson says, or DePaul. He's a sanctimonious bastard. He doesn't give a damn about Sophie. Or you. Or me. Or Anne. I've got to protect her too, somehow. (SCOFFS) Yeah, I guess she took it pretty hard. Hard isn't the word for it. How do you think she took it? Well, I guess right now, I don't really care. You don't want me to go on TV because you're afraid I'm going to use your name. Is that it? Is that what you're trying to tell me? Karen, it's time. I know this is a tough one, Karen. I know it's the last thing you want to do. Open your heart to every Tom, Dick or Harry with a TV. But honey, I got to tell you, unless we get your story out there, unless we flood the state with Sophie's picture and your grief... We're bucking long odds as it is. JOURNALIST 1: Here she comes. Get pictures. JOURNALISTS: Karen, Karen! JOURNALIST 2: Karen, who took your baby? Do you know this woman? (CLAMORING) You can do it, Karen. Yesterday morning, a woman, she said her name was, uh, Marcy Lang. This woman came into my home and stole my little girl, my Sophie Louise. She just took her! (SOBBING) I don't want to hurt this woman, I just want Sophie back. I just want my daughter back. No, it's too round. It's too round. The jawline was, uh, sharper. Uh, I think the eyes were deeper. No, no. Maybe, maybe, uh, wider, you know, because the nose was broader. I said broader. Can't you understand broader? We've been at this for hours and all you've come up with is some kind of street punk. I... I wanna go home. Karen needs me and I need to be doing something real. DePAUL: Do you love your children, Ms. Williams? What do you mean, do I love my children? What kind of a question is that? A straight and forward kind. What do we have here? A young unmarried woman, two kids. A dead-end job. Married lover making no real effort to divorce his wife and lighten the load. Wham-bam, you get pregnant and lover boy still drags his heels. Why are you doing this to me? You know, that's exactly what Mrs. Anderson said when we questioned her. Thought she was going to take off lover boy's head when he finally let her know what was up. But, uh, when the smoke settled, she was crying in his arms and he was telling her how sorry he was and how everything was going to be all right. Some guy out there, real lady killer. So, uh, maybe you're in a post-holiday slump, maybe, uh, you take a good look in the mirror and you don't like what you see, maybe, uh... Maybe you don't see any other way out. Is that how it happened? You can tell me, Karen. I just want to help you. What did you do with the baby, Karen? Are you crazy? I didn't do anything. Tell me where you hid the body. You tell me and I'll try... I didn't do anything! God, I love my baby. I would never do anything to hurt her! My God! Why are you doing this to me? (BABY CRYING) I slept like the dead (CHUCKLING). How long have you been up? (BABY CRYING) She's awfully cry-ey. That's what babies do. All the time? She hasn't cried all the time. She has been ever since I got home. What's that? It's where they cut the umbilical cord. Don't touch it. They get infected easily. She's so tiny, I'm surprised they let you bring her home so soon. What's that supposed to mean? It means I'm surprised that you brought her home so soon. You okay? You're acting kind of funny. What's the matter, hmm? Ah, I just had a baby. I've been up all night. I'm sleepy, that's all. You know, I know you're a strong woman and everything, but, um, maybe you came home from the hospital too soon. I'm fine. How many times do I have to say it? All over the world women have babies in fields. In the US they turn it into a three-room circus. Look, I'm going to shower and try to wake myself up. (BABY CONTINUES CRYING) Oh, sweetheart. Come on. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. (SINGING LULLABY) (BABY CRYING) (PHONE RINGING) RUSSELL: Congratulations, Daddy! How's the bambina? Well, she's got lungs. Yeah, lungs come standard. Hey, look, Cal. It's an Academy tradition to bring dinner over for a week when one of the faculty members has a baby. So, uh, tell me, when do we bring over the meatloaf and peas? Why don't you come on over today? Tell him no. Uh, guess today's not a real good time. Bianca's exhausted. That's the reason for the tradition, Captain. Whoa! Another country heard from. Not today, hang up. Yeah, well, today is definitely... Today is definitely not a good day. Uh, Bianca's really had it. I think she came home from the hospital too soon. Mount Hamilton. Mount Hamilton? Oh, right. She went townie. Well, she went into labor in her office. You know, it was the closest place. Cal, get off! Who's the doctor? The doctor's name was Robards. I don't know... Look, I gotta get off the phone, I gotta help her out, okay? All right. Okay. All right, bye. Well? Sounds like Cal's got his hands full over there. Cal? Isn't that just like a man! Damn! Don't you start. French toast is your favorite. Oh, no. I meant to ask Cal more details about the birth. I want to put an announcement up at the office. Then what happened, Davy? Little Karen get knocked up? Maybe on purpose. Maybe put a little squeeze play on, or maybe she's threatened to blow things for you. Wife, job, life. Maybe you decided one more kid is one more kid too many. You decided little Sophie is more trouble than she's worth. OFFICER: Come on, guy, take it easy, would you? Come on! Hey! Stop it! I didn't kill Sophie, you son of a bitch! I didn't kill her. Take him home, Mrs. Williams. I'll be in touch. Believe it. (CLAMORING) I can't take much more of this. Then maybe you should go home. What? I can't hold you together right now. I can't think about you. All I can think about or care about right now is Sophie. What are you saying to me? I'm saying that DePaul ate me alive too. I'm saying that right now I'm close to breaking and I need somebody to be strong for me. To be really here for me. And I just don't think that you can do that. Karen. Please don't turn away from me now. If you need your hand held, go home to your wife. I'm tapped out. Mrs. Williams, why did you do it? MAN: What did you do with the body? MAN: Karen, have you been charged yet? Still nothing? Nothing. Sorry. (SIGHS) I don't get it. I mean, if it's not the ransom, then what? I mean, what can you do with a baby except to... They mean to keep her, don't they? I mean, am I ever going to see Sophie again? (PHONE RINGING) Hello? WOMAN: Is this Karen Williams? Yes, this is Karen. Well, I think you should know that God is punishing you for your whoring. He took your child because she was born in sin and her mother is a... Don't let it get to you. Stuff like this brings all kinds out from under their rocks. Karen? I'm okay. I am. I just can't sit around here anymore. I've got to do something to find her. Honey, there's not much more you can do. It's the kidnapper's call. MAN: Lieutenant Thompson? We need you outside, sir. Look, Mama, look. It's magic. You can make stuff disappear with it. Lieutenant Thompson gave it to us. Don't you understand? Don't you get it? Your little sister is gone! Maybe dead! Don't you understand that? (SIGHS) It's all my fault. I let her take Sophie. Oh, no, sweetheart, no. It's not your fault. Come here. Come here, sweetheart. I know you love Sophie. That you guys would do anything to help her. And I've never blamed you for any of this, okay? Please, you mustn't think that, okay? We're going to get through this. We just got to stick together. Okay? Be strong for each other. Right? (CROWD MURMURING) MAN 1: She's coming up. MAN 2: Can you give me your list of suspects? MAN 1: Karen, did an attorney help you make the statement? Um... I called this press conference because I know the only way to get Sophie back is to get her face out across the country. That way someone will have to see her and... The police said the first hours are very crucial. Well, Sophie's been gone over 24 and I know that if I'm going to find her, I have to... Karen, certain sources have indicated that you could be responsible for the disappearance of Sophie. That in fact you and your lover have... All right, that's it! Stop it! You just stop it right there. Everything off! Turn everything off. Now! I want you out of my house. You haven't answered my... You can walk or you can crawl. Are you threatening me? I said get out. Now the rest of you can just listen. I need to use you to bring my baby home. And if you get a story, a byline, a prize-winning photograph out of it, I don't really care. That's fine. But from now on, I am using you and I will not be treated like a criminal. Is that clear? The baby was delivered on the 19th. Doctor's name was Robards, Dr. Robards. I guess there's some mistake. Yeah. Sorry to bother you. (EXHALES) That was the craziest thing. The nurse says that there's no record of any Hudson baby being delivered at Mount Hamilton and that Dr. Robards wasn't even on duty Friday. You know what I think? I think she had the baby at home. Don't give me that look, it's the latest thing. Not as far as I'm concerned. You know, Russell. If she did have that baby at home, somebody better go over there and make sure she and the baby are all right. Cal sure wouldn't know what to look for. (SIGHING) Baby did sound pretty fussy when I talked to him on the phone. All right. Tomorrow. I want these out at the airport. Could you put these along Concord? Run these up to Cupertino. Karen, Channel 4 is at 2:30. And did you connect with the public access channel? Too much! Look at this place. It's like a war room in a movie. KAREN: Excuse me, do you have a minute? Are you the regular delivery man? Uh-huh. Have you seen anybody that looks like this woman on your route? She'd be a new customer. No. Mmm-mmm. I'm cold. I want to go home. I know, sweetheart, we just have one more row, okay? Actually, Mom, could you take them home for me? Okay. I wanna stay. I know, sweetheart. Please go home with Grandma, okay? Thanks, Mom. Hey. All right, so... (DOOR OPENING) Anything? Karen? Karen. (SIGHS) I'm losing my milk, Mom. And even when we find Sophie, I won't be able to nurse her. She's even stolen that from me. I know you always wanted more from me, but all I ever had were small dreams, you know? The kind that should come true. A man who loves me. Kids. A job that pays the bills. It really didn't seem like a lot to ask for. (SOBBING) (BABY WAILING) Please stop. I want you to stop. Be quiet. (CRYING CONTINUES) I want you to be quiet. Stop it! Hey, this isn't right. Here. What? Now you're a pediatrician? Look, I don't have to be a pediatrician to know that there's something wrong here. I think we should call Dr. Robards. No! It's ridiculous! Why don't you try to nurse her? I can't. Don't you think I would if I could? The diabetes has dried up my milk. I'm doing the best I can. I can't help it! All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! She won't eat! It's not my fault. (SOBBING) Okay, okay, okay, okay. Why won't she stop crying? Why won't she quit? Make her stop. Just make her stop. Please. Stop it. Hello, Dr. Robards, please. This is Hudson. Captain Cal Hudson. Well, he delivered my baby last Friday. Of course I'm sure. I'm standing here holding her right now! When he gets out of surgery, would you have him call me, please? 555-4327. That's Cal Hudson, Captain Cal Hudson. I never went home. I checked into a motel and I... Look, David, I don't have time for this right now. I don't have time to hear about you. And I don't want flowers or a Christmas tree with an angel on top. I just want my daughter back. Where you going? I'm going on a TV talk show. Molly Thomas called. She's giving me some time. She's a scandal monger. Yeah, but every woman on the peninsula watches her, so right now I don't care if she's Jack the Ripper as long as she gets my story out there. Well, it's my story too, damn it! Karen, look. I'm trying to tell you. I didn't go home. I checked into a motel. I tried to do some work, but I can't. I can't do anything. I can't even sleep. These are just words. You're just feeling sorry for yourself. No. I want her back. Well, if that's true, then you can come on the TV program with me. Go public. Wait, let me ride with you. I still think we should have called first. Uh-uh. Cal would have just put you off again. Surprise, Major. Always the first best tactic. Bianca's going to be really sorry that she missed you but I don't think I should wake her. I think the whole thing pretty much drained her. (BABY COOING) What's her name? Marie. After my mother. LINDSEY: She's adorable. CAL: She's been fussing all night. I just put her down. So what do you think of my little mockingbird? She's great. CAL: Yeah, she's very alert. Not bad for a three-day-old filly, huh? Bianca can't nurse. The baby doesn't like the formula... So what have we got? A, Dr. Robards says he didn't deliver the baby. B, there is no hospital record of the birth. C, Cal's little mockingbird is at least a month old. And Bianca is close to 40. Maybe they found out they couldn't have children and got involved in one of those shady, semi-legal adoptions. Now they want to pass the baby off as their own, like the whole pregnancy was a setup. A fake. That's what I think. My God! It's Bianca. There's no way you're going to tie Karen to this. Oh, Thompson, you know as well as I do three out of five of these so-called stranger abductions are committed by relatives or friends. As far as I'm concerned, Karen Williams is number one with a bullet. Yeah, what is it? We just got a call on the Williams baby. Yeah, where did they spot her this time? Star Search? I think you should talk to this guy. Yeah, what makes this guy any different from the rest of the local crackpots who've called? Cause he's the Air Force Chief of Security. Maybe we finally bought some luck. DAVID: I didn't want to think about what it was like for you. So I didn't. I just stuck my head in the sand. I didn't think about what I was doing to your life. I'm so sorry, Karen. It's not just you. I guess I was just living in a dream world. Fantasizing that everything was going to work out somehow, some way, but I do know what I have to do from now on. That's to stop dreaming or fantasizing but to make things really work for me and for everybody that I care about. (BABY CRYING) That's it! I'm going. You can't walk out on me. I'm not walking out. No! Hey! I'm not walking out on you. I want to get some help for the baby. The baby, the baby. That's all you think about. What about me? You give a damn about me? Listen to her, Bianca! I have, the whole damn night. She's crying because she's hungry. And I suppose that's my fault? Here's the program. Now, we're riding on a John Doe warrant. That'll get us inside. But only if we can find a piece of physical evidence to tie the house to the kidnapping. I doubt they're going to roll the kid across the lawn. You're a real graceful loser. Look, I'm going down to the pharmacy to get some formula that maybe she'll drink, okay? Understand? You think I'm stupid? I heard you on the phone with Robards checking up on me. I'm not checking up on you! You're starting to sound like one of those pet paranoids from down at that clinic. Red Thunderbird. Bingo! John Doe. ...where I could keep you, and now you're running out on me? Hey! It's too cold out here for the baby. Now get back in the house! I'm tired of this smelly, screamy thing. (BABY CRYING) Cal Hudson? Captain Cal Hudson? That's right. Bianca Hudson? I've a warrant to search the premises. What the hell for? Captain, we've reason to believe this baby was kidnapped from her home on Friday, February 19th at about 11:00 a.m. You guys are crazy. This is my daughter. She's Sophie Louise Williams. No, her name is Marie. This is ridiculous! Kidnapping. I mean, you're making fools of yourselves. Look around you. Do we look like the kind of people who'd steal a baby? Give me the baby. Mrs. Hudson, give me the baby. I have a birth certificate, for God's sake! Give me the baby. Cal! Cal, tell them, tell them... Tell them about the nursery, Cal. Tell them about the bear from Germany. Cal! Tell them! Tell them! Bianca, what have you done? (BEEPING) DePaul. I'd like you come down to the station, Mrs. Williams. There's something I'd like you to see. I don't want to do that. I really don't. I mean, I want to get our story out. I don't want to waste any more time with that man's sick accusations. Then don't. (BEEPING) (SIGHS) RUTH: Karen? Karen! It's Mom. I just heard from Lieutenant Thompson. They found the baby, Karen. They found the baby! What? (LAUGHING) Oh, God! Oh, God! DAVID: Whoo! (CHUCKLES) She didn't say if Sophie was alive. I mean, wouldn't she have said? Oh, my God, David, what if... (CAMERAS CLICKING) This is quite a collection. You tell me. That'll do it. Let's go. Why? I was going to lose you. I couldn't let that happen. I'd do it again if I had to. WOMAN: There she is! How do you feel, Karen? (CLAMORING) KEVIN: Mommy! JENNY: Mama! Mommy, Sophie is here! That feel great, Karen? Karen, no! It's too cold. KAREN: No, it isn't. I don't want that woman's clothes on my baby. I'll keep her warm. Oh, I have you back! Oh, it's going to be okay. Sophie! Sophie! (KAREN HUMMING LULLABY)
