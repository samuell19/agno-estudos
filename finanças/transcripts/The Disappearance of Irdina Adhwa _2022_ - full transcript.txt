Hi, babe. How are you? I haven't heard from you in a while, right. By the way, is the trip still happening? Yes, I know we've planned it. But you've not responded. Please confirm. Okay, babe? And let's make this happen. Hey, Mandy. I'm fine. Of course, I said I'll be there. Been busy but... ...I'll see you soon. Finally! Finally, guys. Our vacation is happening. -Yes! Road trip! I know, right? Strange, isn't it? It’s finally happening after planning this long. Yes, it's like a curse they said. If you plan while you're still studying, ...it'll never happen. You're always being superstitious. Enough with those superstitious thoughts. Why, Adam? Are you scared? Of course, not. I don't believe in superstition. Whatever, Adam. Are you okay? I'm fine. You don't seem fine. I'm okay. Ok. Thank you for joining us, Sofi. I know you were reluctant to come along. But I assure you, you'll love the place. I've been meaning to take some time off. And luckily, you've organised this trip. I'm excited. -That's right. We'll have fun for this trip! I guarantee it! Guys... we'll reach our destination in half an hour. That is if traffic is smooth. -Chill guys. I frequent this place with my family. Upon arriving, we'll chill out,... ...relax and settle down. And I promise you guys... ...it’s gonna be... ...awesome. But, you need to know... ...that the peak season is far off. So there won't be anyone around. It'll only be us. I can't wait! What is that? Excuse me. -A little sluggish. Guys. Before we reach that place,... ...buy what you need because it's far from town. So, yes. Buy whatever you need. -Okay. Let's go! -Girls. Where is Sofi? Sofi! Let's take a selfie first. Okay. Come on, Sofi. -Just the girls, but never mind. Mandy, where is your polaroid? Use it now. That's right. Oh, you. Here, take this. Who asked for it? Snap a photo. Me? -Okay. Hurry up. -Ready? Nice! Let's have a look. Nice. We need to take more. Later. -Let's buy some stuff. Okay, come on. I bought some food! Food! Let's go! Let's go. -It's stuck. Let's unload these. Carry it properly. One, two. Two more. Okay, ladies. These are your keys. -Thank you, baby. Head upstairs. Rest, shower or freshen up, okay. Fahmi and I are heading out for a while. We're going to collect something. Whatever. Okay. -All right, come on. Want to come along? Come on. Everyone. Do your mobile phones have reception? Restart your phone. Maybe, you'll get reception. I restarted mine because there was no reception just now. But the battery died. I did all that but nothing works. Chill, Nat. We're on vacation mode. So we don't need reception. Natasha Adlina, good luck with that. Oh my God! Liyana. Look at the kitchen. Look at the table. So huge. We can have a feast! I love this. -All right. Guys, look at this! Oh my God! This is huge! Liyana! Yes? Nice. Try each one of these. I'm not sure which one for this room. Okay. -Enjoy. Mandy! Are we sharing a room tonight? Yes! Sofi, are you okay? I'm fine. -Sorry for what happened to..... It's okay. This is a beautiful place. Isn't it? You didn’t bring your bow? No, I regret for not bringing it along. But I still feel like I want to explore. Explore? The thing is you won't listen to my advice anyway. But as usual, be careful. You sound like my mother now. I'm just saying, Sofi. You can sleep outside tonight. But I have the room key. Who goes there? Help yourselves. Not bad, Fahmi. The food you cooked is delicious. That's good. Who cooked this? Fahmi? I'm not comfortable if Fahmi cooked this. Just taste it. It's delicious. Try before judging. This is delicious! You can become a chef, Fahmi. You took the wrong course at university. You should've majored in culinary. I'm three years late. -Still, this is delicious. Enjoy the food. Sofi. Lately, I noticed... ...that you seem tense. You hardly socialise with us. I don't know. I feel you've distanced yourself from me. You're always busy with whatever you do. Is it because of Irdina? I know you how close you both are. She is... Was my best friend. And she was a good friend. The first time we met,... ...we clicked right away. Right? I noticed that too. But... ...your personalities are completely the opposite. That's right. She was an introvert... ...and I was an extrovert. But maybe our differences attracted us to each other. The important thing is... ...she wasn't pretentious. I could see through her and vice versa. I envy both of you. I miss her. Since she disappeared without a trace,... ...I can't think of anything logical for what she did. I didn't think she would do anything unexpected. I don't know if I had overlooked something. Or, maybe I made a mistake. I don't know. It's scary. Someone you know is missing. You've no clue if she is alive or dead. Sofi. It's not your fault. Maybe she has a reason for it. Come here. Tonight's loser... ...will have to do the dishes. Hold on, you're a woman. So you should do the dishes. Insolent. Adam, you're sexist. Tonight, you'll be sleeping... ...outside if you win. Even if you win. You're a goner. There you go, Adam. You'll do the dishes tonight. Loser! Satan. So what's the next game? How about... ...a guessing games? I like that. Unless... ...Sofia doesn't want to join. All right, come on. Okay, before that... ...I'll pour this first. What is that drink? -Lemonade... ...which I made. I have drank that before. Okay, this is how we play it. Everyone will be given a chance to ask questions. Okay? You can ask anyone in this group. If you guess correctly,... ...the person you ask the question will drink this. If it's wrong, the person who asked will drink instead. Each person gets to ask two questions. Okay, I'll start. Okay, guys. Natasha. You like large things, right? How rude! Well,... ...of course. Okay, drink up. -So, I'll drink, okay. This is bad. -Okay, one more. Do you like to eat sushi? I can confirm that. Okay, fine. Drink up! This is not good. You don’t like eating vegetables. Okay. Drink up! Do I have to drink some more? You're afraid of the dark. Mandy! Drink up! My turn. Mandy. You dislike boyfriends who don't listen to you. Is that why you're single, Mandy? Okay, one more. Your ex-boyfriend left you. You're wrong. Your turn to drink. Drink. Drink up! All right, it's my turn. Adam. You're in trouble. The girl you have a crush on... She's a nerd. Just like you! Okay, one more. Your crush... ...knows you like her. Wow. You got me. Drink up! -And... ...there is more. The girl you have a crush on... ...has rejected you. Hold on. Why am I being asked again? This is my place. So you have to play by my rules. Drink up! Okay. My turn. Sofia. Your thoughts are perplexed... ...because of Irdina, right? Is it so obvious? -Nat. Please. What? There is nothing wrong with that. This is extremely sour... Okay. -You're welcome. Hold on. I'm not done yet. At the moment, you don't know... ...if Irdina is... ...alive or... ...dead. -Nat! Have a good night. What's your problem? What's your problem? Chill, guys. She doesn't know. Doesn't know what? Don't pretend that you don't know. Just shut it, all of you. What's up with you? I want to know what's the deal with all of you. Where are you, Ir? Who goes there? Dan. Are you okay? Idiot! I didn't hear you coming. Sorry. So what are you doing here alone? Nothing. What are you doing here? I can't sleep. I went out but saw you here so I came over. Where's Fahmi? I don't know. Maybe, already asleep. What's your plan after this? I'm not sure. It hasn't crossed my mind. Dan. What happened to Irdina? Why are you asking me? Well, has she ever crossed your mind? What for? It's not my fault she's missing. Don't you feel guilty for what you did to her? Now listen. All of us made a deal. We all agreed to be silent about it. Don't start this. Remember, you were involved that night too. But I'm not guilty, Dan. Keep telling that yoursef. Busy? Nope. So... Now? If you're not okay,... ...I'll come back later. I just feel... ...insecure. Do you want me to get water? Can you? Please? What's wrong, Sofi? -Sofi, are you okay? Nat? Nat! Who did this? What happened? Where is Fahmi? I don't know. Adam? No. No! Sofia! Sofia! Sofia! Dan, it's Fahmi. Fahmi. Is he dead? Where? Nat! Check your phone. We'll call the police. -There is no reception here. My phone doesn't have reception. We are not safe here. I think someone is hunting us. Help me close the curtains... ...and lock all the doors. There is a killer outside this house. Who was the first person to found the body? Dan, how can you refer to them as bodies? They're our friends. It's Natasha... ...and Fahmi! -Shut up! I'm asking. Who was the first person to found the body? Me. As far as I know,... ...the killer could be among us. And as far as I know, the murder's motive is vehement. Are you saying it's me? You better think twice before deciding on accusing me. Who else is upset with Natasha? Do you think I'm strong enough to kill them? Let alone Fahmi who is 10 times stronger than me! I don't know. Maybe. You've lost your mind. Lost my mind? -Stop it! That's enough! Please don't argue now. I think we need to call the police now. There's no point, Adam. This area is isolated. We can only get reception if we go to the town. Then... ...what should we do now? I think we must get out of here. We have to go to the van now. We'll go to town for help. Is it a good idea for us to leave this place? The killer might be outside waiting for the opportunity. Do you have a more substantial idea? If you do, please share it. I want to hear it. Adam is right. The possibility of him attacking us is high... ...while we head to the van. Then what do you suggest, Sofi? I suggest we stay put. -Stay put? You've lost your mind, Sofi. Stay here? Go ahead, be my guest. I'm taking the van. You can come with me if you want. Those who want to die, stay. Dan. Listen to Sofia's explanation first. We don't know how many people are outside. Maybe one, maybe two. But we must assume there is more than one killer. There is a possibility the van has been sabotaged. How would you know? -Logic. Use your brain cells. If I'm a killer, I wouldn't want us to escape this place. Our van is our only means of transportation. Where is our van? Outside, right? The killer is outside waiting for us to make a wrong move. So in my opinion, ...it's better to stay here... ...rather than taking our chances outside. Survive until dawn. I still believe our chances of being alive is high... ...if we leave now. I have the keys to the van. Let's go, guys! What are you waiting for? Come on! -Didn't you hear what I said? It's very risky for us to go outside now! If we stay here, we'll die. Do you want to die? Look, guys. The important thing now is for us to stay alive. Yes. But if you leave now, ...the chances of you surviving is slim. The moment you go out, he wins. But Sofi, if we remain here, nobody will come to our rescue... ...because nobody is aware of our current situation. We have to leave and ask for help. That's true, but not so soon. It's difficult to see at night. It's better to stay together until the sun rises. At least we'll have the advantage of sight. Enough! I don't want to hear any of this. Adam, do you want to come along or stay here? You mean... ...abandon them here? I don't think so. Fine. Fine! Dear. Okay, I'll go along. Mandy. No. We don't know where the killer is. Whether he's in the house or not. We have to go while we have the chance. We'll come back, Sofi. Piece of shit! -What is it? I can't start it. So how? This is your idea so try harder! Hold your horses! Can't you see that I'm trying? Do you want to take over? Cursed! Amanda. Did you hear anything? No. Amanda. Open it. Open the bonnet. Just pull it. Turn on the lights quickly. So it's not the battery. So what's the plan now, Dan? Are they still out there? I don't know. I can't see. But the van is still there. I think we should find something to defend ourselves. Adam, double check this place. Ensure you lock the doors and windows. Okay. What's the plan, Dan? We need to find something. Find anything that is sharp. Look for weapons. Look around here and I'll look at the back. Okay. Amanda? Oh my God. Amanda! Liyana. Don'tt come close! -Liyana! No! -Liyana, it's Adam! Did you see him? What does he look like? Tell me, Amanda! Amanda? Amanda! Amanda! Quickly open this door! Open! -Daniel! Dan! Why are your hands bloody? Dan, what happened? No. It's not my blood. -What do you mean? Amanda. She's dead. She was stabbed in the neck. But I couldn't see him because it was too dark! How could you not save her? She was your responsibility, ...but you failed! Where were you when she needed you? I... I what!? -Shut up! I couldn't save her, okay! She's dead! What do you want me to do? So did you see who killed her? It's dark outside. I didn't see who did it! Liyana? Where is Liyana? She is in Sofia's room. She was attacked earlier. What? We didn't hear anything. There was no sound at all. Liyana was screaming. She was already on the floor when we saw her. No! Shit! Daniel! Amanda's death, is on you. This is not the time to be dramatic. The crucial thing now is to stay alive. Dear. What's our plan now, Sofi? I don't know. Daniel! -Don't worry. Shit! -Daniel! Yeah. Is there a fusebox here? I'm not sure. -Where is the fusebox? I can check it out. Check out the storeroom behind. But I'm now sure which side. Okay, what now? I'll go. -No, please don't go! I'm scared! No. -Okay. We are at a disadvantage. The killer will use his advantage to hunt us down one by one. As you have seen. We require light to handle this problem. Dan, please. I'm sure an electrician boy can sort this out. I need to take a look at it first. Is there a problem? Do you have a torchlight? No. I do. Are there tools around here? Pliers, spanner, screwdrivers or anything? Just check in the storeroom later. No, guys. Please. No. Please don't. Dan, stop them. Please, Dan! It's okay. Be careful, okay. Let's go. -Guys. There is something you should know. The killer uses arrows. Arrows? Aren't you an archer, Sofi? Yes but... Can you provide more details on that? I got out of the van. Then he shot me using his arrow right next to me. It was close but he missed. And you didn't see that person? I was only concerned about my life. Amanda. Sofia. Calm down. I'm sorry, Sofia. I know you were close. What did you find? A hunter's tip. What does that mean? It's not for shooting targets but it's a broadhead. It's usually used for hunting animals. Sofi. What is it? Dan, open this door! -Open the door! Dan! Dan, open the door! Run! Run, Sofi! Adam, hurry up! Who is that man? I don't know. Sofi, how can you be so brave? I don't see you losing composure. Aren't you afraid? What makes you say I'm not afraid? I am afraid. But I haven't seen you in fear. My father would always remind me... ...that we must be prepared in any situation. He also said that wisdom is better than brute force. But why? I'm a girl. Women lack the strength of men. To tackle the strength of men... ...is by using common sense. Now I understand why... ...Irdina was close to you. You had a crush on her, right? How did you know that? Irdina. Did she tell you that? I don't know how she disappeared without a trace. No calls or texts. Nothing. She was all over the news. I'm still puzzled by that incident. What happened to her? That question haunts me every night. Yes! Sofi, what if tonight's killing is connected to Irdina? What do you mean? Well, after a year of Irdina's disappearance, ...this happens tonight suddenly. And you're suggesting...? Do you remember Amanda's birthday party last year? Yes. I couldn't come as I was ill. Something happened that night. What are you trying to say? Never mind, I think we should check the circuit now. I think we should leave this place. You want to abandon them? -To hell with them! I do not care anymore. What are you afraid of? Are you afraid that your life is in danger or afraid Sofia... ...will find out about that night? -Shut up! What has that got to do with all this? Yes, I think all that is connected to tonight! Oh God! This is all your fault! Bitch! Don't put all the blame on me. Don't forget... ...that you too were involved that night. I don't care anymore! If we survive tonight, you and me are over! Oh! Well, of all the time you've had to repent, ...you choose this moment? Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant! If Adam doesn't tell her, ...I will. Who goes there? Daniel! No! I don't see anyone out there. What are we supposed to do now? We should just get out of this place. Have you lost your mind? Didn't you see someone is out there? We'll just wait here for them! They can take care of themselves. Dan. -Do you want to live or die? Come on. Now! Just come. -I don't want to! Hurry up. Dan, please! I'm sorry, Liyana. But you're a liability. -No! No, Dan! Dan! I'm sorry. Please, just let me go. Please. Okay. Sofia. Yes! Shit. What happened? -Hang on. The fusebox burnt. There's nothing much I could do. -Okay. Never mind. Let's go back to where the others are. Okay. Be careful. Adam. What are you staring at? Blood. What? -No. Liyana? No. Irdina? How is Irdina related to this? Is there something I should know about Irdina? Adam, run! Dan, open the door! Dan! What's your problem? Do I have a problem or both of you... ...are hiding something from me? Liyana is dead. Where were you? What have you done? Me? What did I do? She was out of her mind. Enlighten me. Look, I tried to stop her from leaving this place. I told her that we should wait for you to return. But she insisted on leaving! She was holding a knife. I don't want to die so I can't force her to stay. How can you be so selfish? Did you hear what you said? -There was nothing I could do! I told her she'll die if she went out there! Is that all you can say? She's dead outside, Dan! It's not my fault! I'm sure you've something to do with this. Why are you looking at Adam? Why don't you ask Adam about Irdina? Ask him. What is he talking about? I... Adam? -I don't know. Bullshit! Don't you fucking lie, Adam. You were there that night! What night? What night? Amanda's birthday party. The night that you didn't attend to. Irdina? Yes, Irdina. Do you want to know what happened that night? Don't listen to him, Sofi. -Shut up! You don't dare to tell her so I will. She came. Irdina came that night. She wore a white dress. I can still remember it. That night, Adam wanted to ask Irdina to sleep with him. But because Irdina rejected him,... ...Adam did something he shouldn't have done that night. Adam. I also remember that night, ...everyone in that house wanted to get Irdina. Since she is considered pure. And everyone knows you took care of her. You're like her guardian angel. And then, Amanda decided to play a game. Adam, tell her what you saw that night. What did I saw? What did I saw? I saw you! You and Fahmi! You both raped her! And you failed to stop us that night. All you did was watch. Fahmi was right about you. You are not a man! You killed Liyana! You killed Irdina! -No. Technically, I didn't kill her. She was the one who killed herself. And you're too stupid to see this since losing her. How could you do this to Irdina? -Bitch! She wanted it. From the way she looked at me, I knew she wanted me. And since you already know this secret, ...I guess I should stop you being alive. What are you trying to do? What I should've done five minutes ago. Adam! He's lost in his own world. Run, Sofia! Run! You! You killed Irdina! She wanted it, Adam! You deserve to die! No! You forced me into this, Adam. You forced me! Okay, inhale. Exhale. Your head needs to be straight. Shoulders, relax. Remember when you draw, ...engage your back muscles. Okay? Your wrist needs to be straight and remember... ...the string should be on the first pad of your fingers. Okay? You can do it. You can do it. Now, draw. Remember your anchor point. And anytime you're ready, aim at the yellow target. That was so close! It's okay. Look at that. By practising, your accuracy will get better. There is no failure except in no longer trying. Do you know what? I can actually... ...see the similarities... ...between the two of you. Who? My brother. You know, both of you are determined and strong willed. Like, whatever you decide to do, ...you'll work hard for it. ...until you achieve your goal. I've seen that in him... ...and in you. Exactly what you said. Since we're talking about your brother, ...how is he? I haven't heard about him in a long time. I think he's okay. It's just that as you know him, ...he's too strict. I can't really complain. Because he's the best guardian I have. But I hope... ...he'll be like a brother to me. Instead of being a guardian. I'm so sorry, Ir. It's okay. Look, I know sometimes... ...your brother can be very strict with you. But he's doing his best... ...to give you the best life possible. He just wants to protect you, Ir. This is a cruel world. We can't control everything. I think he only wants... ...you to always be in a safe place. He loves you, Ir. You mean everything to him. I know. But I feel I don't have a social life because of him I try to get out of my comfort zone. I just want to be someone who... ...is highly determined. Someone who likes challenges. Just like you. That's all. I understand how you feel. If there's anything I've learned from my experience is that... we must get up. It doesn't matter how many times we fall... ...or how hard we fall. We must get up. Pick ourselves up. The only time... ...we don't have a chance... ...is when our breath ceases. Do you know what? I have never told you this but... ...actually I used to be so jealous of you. I still am. Well, you're talented in everything you do. I didn't know the reason, but now I do. You have such fierce determination. And you've given me more strength than you realise. And one thing, I promise... ...I will never give up. Never. Okay? Oh you. I will always be by your side, Ir. I know. I almost forgot. Wait. Close your eyes. Don't open. Now you can open your eyes. Happy Birthday. This is a trigger for you. Thank you. I hope you like it, okay. Okay. Done. Okay, now. I want to see you to hit that yellow target. Don't miss, okay. Just that one. -Sure. I find it funny... ...when people show their true colours. When you push them into survival mode. From human beings, ...they turn into animals. Read. I told you to read it! "May 15... ...2019. I was invited... ...to Amanda's 19th birthday. The night when my life was destroyed... ...in the blink of an eye. The last time I received a gift... ...was from my mother... ...who had long ago gone... ...to the Almighty. That night,... ...I intended to wear the chain bought... ...by my brother. And that night,... ...I wore it with confidence." Continue before I slit your throat. "My steps... ...heading towards Amanda's house... ...was cumbersome. As if something was dragging me forward. At that moment I realised... ...that my life has been destroyed,... ...my dignity has been tarnished... ...and there was nobody who could help me." "And there was nobody who could help me." Can you imagine her situation at that moment? And as for you, I don't need to ask anything. You felt nothing that night. You just wanted pleasure from her. And by satisfying your lust, recklessly, you robbed her of her future. You tarnished her dignity. Simultaneously, destroying her will... ...to live. And in order... ...to cover up what you did that night,... ...you were willing to kill your friend. I am very impressed with you, Daniel. You're willing to go that far to save yourself. For Irdina's sake,... ...I was willing to go far. It took me a year to arrange all this. And I made sure I'll succeed. I took a long time... ...as I wanted to ensure this plan succeeded. I know. I couldn't afford to abide by the system... to ensure I get justice ...for what all of you did. The system requires financing. I don't have funds. But I have the skills... ...and desire. I brought her up. I ensured she had food on the table. And you raped her senselessly. And due to that, ...she is gone forever. No. Take a closer look! -Help! Take a look at this! Say goodbye. No. I want you to say goodbye now. Goodbye. Goodbye, Irdina. -Goodbye. Goodbye, Irdina! Oh my God, Dan! Oh my God. Let go of me! Now, it's your turn. I know who you are. Izdan. Who else looked after Irdina? Who else loved Irdina? Then you know why you need to die. No, I don't. She had the tendency to leave the house. She didn't tell me anything that night. And I didn't ask her. But then she gave me that look. I never imagined that was the last night I would see her. But one thing for sure about her, what you can say is... ...she was a good girl. I loved her so much. Loved her so dearly. She was my sister, Sofia. My sister. Whatever you've done tonight... ...is not going to bring her back. -Where were you... ...when she needed you? That is not fair. Shut up! There is no reason which can save you. It's all written in her diary. There is no turning back. Say goodbye to Irdina. She wouldn't want you to do this. -Say goodbye. Say her name. -No! Say her name! -No! 60 pounds. Sofia! Sofia! The trigger. I'm in control of the situation now. No! I will skin you alive! Open up, Sofia! I want to ensure you die a quick death. I'm sorry. Wait until Sofia comes before you go out. You have all your books, right? Yes. Izdan. -Hi, Sofi. Don't you have training today? You've packed? Okay. I want to go but I need to drop off your friend here. She took so long to get ready. What time will you be done today? As usual. It's fine. -Okay. Okay, let's go. Don't worry. She's with me. I was just about to remind you. Irdina. -What? Love you. Sister, respond. Respond. Okay, fine. I love you too. Take good care of her! Okay. Come on.
