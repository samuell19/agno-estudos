Did you get washed up? - Yes. - Let me see. All right, good work. Did you brush your teeth? Yeah? Wait, wait, what's that? - It's a punching bag! - Yeah, it sure is. Man! OK, OK, I give up. I give up! Jeffrey. Come here, buddy. Don't worry about it, it was just an accident, all right? Hey, maybe you guys can help me with this chapter. It's a tough one. I can't get outta Texas. You got any ideas? - Can you take like, a car? - Yeah, but I'm having some car trouble. - What about a waterboat? - Damn it! It's all right, I know you didn't mean it. - I'm sure he didn't. - Hi, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you come in. - That's OK. Can I try? - Yeah, OK. - He likes those? - Yeah, he does. Can I help you with anything? - Is it OK if I just look around? - Yeah, sure. - Finches. My dad used to have finches. What kind are those, they're so beautiful. - I don't know, actually. - You don't know? - No. - Maybe you shouldn't be working a pet store. - Yeah, maybe. - Sorry, it was just a thought. ♫ It's time to forgive ♫ these sins ♫ It's time to forgive ♫ - What is it? - It's chili. Hand me the salt? Thank you. - I don't like chili. - Come on, you love chili, here. Take this, stir it around for awhile, make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom. - Hello, David. - Alice! - Hi, guys! Hey, I missed you! - Are you going to live with us, again? - No sweetheart, I'm just visiting. But while I'm here we're gonna have a good time. - Yeah. - Let me help you with that. - I got it. - Do you have a broom? - I said I got it. What are you doing here? - Can't a girl come back and visit her family? - Yeah, I guess. - Well, aren't you gonna give your big sister a hug? - Come see my room, Alice! - Not right now. Do you guys want your presents? - Yeah! - Sure! - Let's do it. - Cool! - All right, guys, can you go wash up, please? - But we're not dirty. - Yes, you are. Come on. - Can Alice come? - No, just go wash up now, come on. - You're really good with them. - Somebody's gotta do it. - So is Mom upstairs? - No, she's back in the hospital. - Why? - She went off her meds and she got manic. She checked herself in last week. - Well, when is she coming back? - They don't know. They think it could be a while. I mean, I only talked to her once, but she feels bad about it. - Yeah, I bet she does. These were here a year ago. - What'd you expect? - I don't know. Things to be different, I guess. Anyways, I found a really great apartment. It's got a lot of light. And I found a new job as an artist's assistant. - That's good for you. - I mean, working definitely has its downsides. It's pretty nice to be back. - Maybe you should try it sometime. - Are you sure you'd want me here with you? Give it back. - Hey, what are you doin'? - Nothin'. I'm gonna go for a swim, you guys wanna come? - Yeah! - Mommy says we're not allowed. - It's all right, you're going with me. Come on. - All right. Yeah, OK. Shit. No, no, not you. Yeah. That much longer? And then as an outpatient? Yeah. Nope, thank you. - Mind if I join you? - Go ahead. - Bird Guide? David, you're such a nerd. - Thanks. - Seriously, you gotta get a life. - You think you could take over? - I wouldn't want to. - I didn't think so. Thanks. So why'd you come back here, anyways? - I told you, I just came back for a visit. - Come on, Alice. Don't lie to me. - I lost my job. - I thought so, and the apartment? - That too. - That's all right, you'll find another job, come on. - Yeah, I hope so. - Come on, you got any new tattoos? - Stop, get your own. Christ. - Jesus, Alice, I thought you weren't gonna do that anymore. What'd you do that, for? - Nothing! - Come on, what hurt more than that? - A guy. - What guy? - With a wife and a kid in California. - I see you still know how to pick 'em? - Fuck you. - It's all right. - Anyway, I got you something. - Thanks. Wow, this is nice wrapping. - You're such an asshole, just open it! - This is beautiful. - It's a journal. For like, ideas, or whatever. You know, to write the next great American novel. Anyways, it's no biggie. - No, yeah, it is. Thanks, Alice. - You're welcome. - Hi. - Hi. - It's from the woman next door. - Yeah, Mary. Thanks. - I thought I was the only one who takes three sugars. - Apparently not. So what's your name? - Chris. - I'm David. Are you new in town? - Yeah, I just moved from Maine. I'm in that house on Crescent Street with the big boat out front. - Yeah, I know that one. - And how are you guys doing? Wow, he understood me! - Yeah? What'd he say? - He said it's a little cramped in there. - Sorry to hear that. These are cockatiels, those are parakeets, and finches over there. A peachface, that's about it. - I'm impressed. Maybe this is the place for you, after all. - I don't think so. - I'd like to buy one. - A bird? - Yeah. - OK, do you need a cage? - Um, no. No, I think I'll just let him fly free. - All right, well, birds shit a lot, you know. - Can I get this one? - Yep. It's all right. - Aw! I think I'll name him David. - That's kind of a strange name for a bird. - It's a good name, I like it. David, meet David. - I think he's shy. - Like his namesake? - OK. - OK. - Come on. - How much is it? - It's on the house. - Aw, thank you. That's really nice of you. - I have to show you something! - All right, I'll see you later. - What do you think? Your honest opinion. - Well, maybe we could get together some time. - Yeah, I'd like that... - David! - What? - Is it too bright? - What is it? - It's a dress, Professor. It's for Mom for her birthday. Is it too much? - It's fine. - I thought maybe we could drive home together. - I can't, I gotta do inventory. ♫ Trade all these ♫ Empty sounds - Hey, freak! ♫ For a wave ♫ Of real love ♫ Knock me down ♫ Down in a whirlpool ♫ I will drown ♫ Down like a castle ♫ Stormed from the ground ♫ You are my last shot ♫ My final round ♫ If we fail I'm nothing ♫ Just put me down ♫ Down like a black bear ♫ A thousand growls ♫ Down in a plane crash ♫ A thunder sound ♫ So loud ♫ Hear me now ♫ So loud ♫ - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - What a surprise. - Is that okay? - Sure! Come on in. - So you’re still unpacking? - Yeah, sort of, I'm organizing things. - Here. - Thanks. - Yeah, that's me and my dad. We used to go camping every summer before my parents got divorced, just the two of us. This is his house, actually. - Is he here? - No, he left it to me. He died, actually, earlier this year. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Aw yeah, thanks, it's all right. I barely saw him after he left. What about your parents? - I live with my mom at the moment. - And my little half brother and half sister. - Aw, that must be nice being close to your family like that. - No, it's overrated. I bet you anything it's cooler in Maine? - It is! Have you ever been there? - No, actually I haven't been anywhere. - Why not? - Just kinda stuck at the moment. It would be hard for me to leave. - Is it 'cause of that girl who came into the pet store? - Alice? No, no, she's my sister. No, she doesn't - even live here anymore. I haven't even seen her for over a year. I saw you let the bird go. - You did? - Yeah. - Why didn't you tell me? And then why did you bring over the bird seed? - I guess so I'd have a reason to see you. Well you don't need a reason, not at all. - I gotta go. - OK. - Alice doesn't think about things like dinner? - OK. - OK, thank you. Bye. - OK, bye! - Thanks. - You're welcome. - So where's David? - He'll be home soon. - It's Mom! She's driving a motorcycle, see? - Yeah! - Do you think she'll like it? - Are you kidding? She'll love that! - David! - Hey where were you? - Look at my motorcycle, David! - That's nice, Jeffrey. I was downtown running some errands. You made pizza? - Frozen food is really bad for them. - Please. - You should've got delivery. - Well why don't you get it next time then? Listen David, can you take a look at Mom's car tomorrow? I hate takin' that stupid bus. - Yeah, I don't think so. - Come on David, please? Can you just take a look at it? It might just be a missed connection or something, come on. - I'll see what I can do. - Thanks. I got a new job today, so I'll be outta your hair soon anyway. - Really, that was fast. - Yeah, lucky I guess. - You're still playin'? - Looks like it. - Can I play? - Actually, I was just gonna go in. - Come on David, let's shoot some hoops for old time's sake. Let's see if I can still beat you. - What are you talkin' about, you never beat me. - Yeah? - You're on. ♫ You can rewind ♫ I can re-plan it ♫ We have to go high - Who was that girl in the pet store? - Nobody. - Yeah, really?

I know Dee and Jeffrey really are. I really like my new apartment. I have a great job and I'm learning how to make prints. - I've just been here so long, I don't even know what's going on anymore. Do you know if there's been any news from Jim? - Jesus. Mom, he left you over a year ago. - Well he's Jeffrey and Dee's father after all. - Exactly. - They should know him. - You mean that you wanna know him? - I think they really must be giving me too much of this new medication. It makes me feel so sleepy. Maybe you could talk to the nurses. - OK, don't worry, I'm on my way out. - Are you gonna be home when I get back? - I seriously doubt it. Hello, hi. I'm calling about the position you're advertising in The Voice? It has. Already. OK, great. Thank you. - Will you come swimming with us? - Nope. - Please? - Please? - I said no. And you guys can't go alone. - Can we just go in a little bit? - Alice said no. - OK. - You talkin' to me? - No. - I don't see anybody else here, you talkin' to me? - No! - Hey David, you wanna put on a green face mask? - Maybe next time. - Please David? - Come on, don't be a spoil sport. - I can't, I gotta go. - Don't take those. They're ancient. Take these. They're mine, extra strength. - Thanks. - Are you sure you don't wanna be a green monster? - I can't. - Aren't you gonna say goodnight to us? - Alice'll do that. - All right, bye David. - Bye guys. - Okie dokie artichokie. Let's rinse. ♫ Darlin' Denise you’re ♫ Frustrating me complicating my dreams - Hi. - Hi! - I'm really sorry I'm late. - That's OK. Do you still wanna see the movie? 'Cause it started like 10 minutes ago. - Yeah, yeah. - OK! ♫ I've fallen for thee ♫ - You didn't like the movie? - It was OK. - Yeah, I guess it wasn't that good. - No, it was all right. Maybe next time though, you should pick it. - Next time? - Yeah, next time. You should pick it. - So, what about your dad? - He died a long time ago. We were really little. - That really sucks, doesn't it? - Yes, it does. - I was going through my dad's things, and I found something that I wanted to give you. - Thanks. - Yeah, I don't know, I thought it was cool. I thought you would like it. - Are you sure, 'cause... - Yeah! I want you to have it. - Well thank you. - You're welcome. - Yeah, I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything. I mean, that's one of the things I like about you. - David! - You're home. - Yeah. - Look David, I'm drinking and driving. - That's great, Alice. - Thanks for doing this, I really appreciate it. - Yep. All right, try it. - Damn, all right. - Should I get you a calendar with big-breasted girls holding tools? - No, I just wanna get this piece of shit fixed. All right, try it again. - All right David, you're a genius! I love this song, do you remember this song? You remember this song, this used to be your favorite song. Remember? Yeah! I know, let's go on a joy ride. - I don't know. ♫ Follow the sunlight from the sky ♫ Swallowed it all up in the life ♫ And then the world it seems to quiver ♫ And to quake ♫ We twist and turn away but never will escape ♫ Hide in the trees, the name I know ♫ Watch as the sky begins to glow ♫ Movin' across the dusty earth ♫ - It's so nice out! - Yeah, it is. - What are you lookin' at? - Nothing. This is some picnic, Alice. - I know, sorry. You have a tiny little spider crawling on your neck. - Just get rid of it, OK? - I don't know if I should. - Come on, Alice. - Spiders mean luck, you know, in ancient Egypt. I think maybe it bit you. - What, the spider? - You think it's poisonous? - I don't know. - What are we gonna do? - David, come on. Nothing’s gonna happen, OK? It’s not gonna happen again, I promise. Look, I’ll be leaving soon, anyways. - Right, yeah, I forgot you're good at that. - David wait! Where are you going? - I gotta go, I have plans. - What are you talking about? You never have plans! - Gimme the keys. I'm driving. You drive like shit, give me the keys. - Fuck you! - Come on! - Just come in, OK? Stay here with us. - I gotta go. - Hi! - Can I come in? - Yeah, of course! Whoa, whoa, no David stop. What's going on? - Nothing. - What do you mean, nothing? Something’s obviously just happened. Are you all right? Do you wanna sit down? - No. - David, David what's wrong? - Get off! I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'll come see you tomorrow. - OK, this doesn't hurt, right? - No. - This is OK? All right. That's probably... - What happened? - Dee fell off the roof. - Is everything all right Dee? - I hurt my ankle. - She's fine, I called the doctor, she's gonna get some x-rays tomorrow. - And where were you when all this happened? - I was right here, David. - Well, maybe you could actually watch them, then. - David, I don't have eyes in the back of my head, OK? Where the hell were you anyway? - What were you doing on the roof, Dee? - I was just looking. - You know you're not allowed to do that, you know that. - Sorry! - Dee, you're really workin' on a world record here? I think you've got the biggest ankle ever. It's like the size of a grapefruit. - Yeah, look, it’s as heavy as an elephant. My God. - Can't even lift this thing. I don't really know how this thing works. - There’s actually an easier way to do it. Let me show you. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Are you sleeping? - No. - I had an idea. I'm gonna build a fort. - That's a great idea. - Can you help us? - Maybe when I'm not working. - Jeffrey, leave David alone. - It's all right. - Dee's asleep, the swelling's already going down. - Yeah, that's good. - Goodnight, David. - Goodnight. - What are you guys doin'? - We're building a fort. - And in David's room, we're gonna have the turtle live with him. For more comfort. - That's great, Jeffrey 'cause turtles are excellent for comfort. - That's a pretty good fort. - Yeah, Jeffrey’s idea for the roof. - Yeah, it looks like a Teepee. It does look like a Teepee. - Hi David. - Hey Chris. Let me get those for you - Thanks. - Which one’s mine? - We both take them the same. Remember? - Right. - Thanks. So what happened to you, I thought you were gonna come by? - Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to take care of the kids. Just, family stuff. - Well do you wanna come over later? - Yeah, I'm not sure if I can. - I mean, what should I do, David? Should I buy another bird? - I'm sorry, I just, I don't think this is gonna work. - What? - I just can't really handle this. Just another person right now. It's complicated. - I'm sure it is. - Yeah, I don't know what to say. - What do you mean you don't know what to say? That is so lame! - Hi David. - Yeah, OK. Yeah, you're right. This does seem rather complicated. - I'm sorry Chris. - Yeah me too, me too. - What are you sorry about? - Nothing. - He really shouldn't eat that. Don't feed him junk food. I gotta get back to work. What are you doing here anyway? - We came to get the turtle. - Looks great. - Thanks. - All right, gimme that foot, buddy. - I even put her name on the card. - I like that. - Here's the bag for that. - Yeah? - You're set. - Is that it? - Yeah. - Yep. - All set? Dee, what are you doing? - I'm getting food for the trip. - Honey, you know it's only a 20 minute drive. Here, take this, all right? - Can we take Harry? - The turtle stays. - Here Jeffrey, take this. - Well this isn't working. I look terrible. - You look nice. Are you ready now? They're waiting. - Can you just tell 'em I'm too tired? It's the lithium. - If you could just wait a little while longer. - There's no smoking. - Yeah? Since when did the nuts quit? - Share that with your sister. - Thanks. - I wanna go home. - Don't you wanna wish Mom a happy birthday? - Hey, what's goin' on Jean? Are we gonna be able to see my mom or not? - Let me check again. - No no no, go that way. - OK, we just tried that way Dee, do you see? Do you wanna try this way? - Let's try that way. - OK, let's try this way. - I'm sorry. Your mom says she can't see you today. - We've been waiting for over two hours! Do you know how hard that is for kids? - Maybe you could come back tomorrow. - Fuck that. - But we wanna see Mommy! - Well, Mommy doesn't wanna see you, let's go. - Mommy's just super tired right now, Jeffrey, OK? We'll see her another time. - Yeah, like in your dreams. Come on. Jeffrey. - It was Jim who made her crazy, you know. With all of his stupid girlfriends, he just broke her heart. - No, Mom was crazy even before Jim, you know that. Even when she was with Dad. - No way, Dad adored her. - He was not perfect, Alice. - Well, he's dead now. So, yes he was. I think it's time for a refill. Two more, doubles. - No, no, no. - Yeah yeah yeah. - I've had enough. - No! - We're gonna do one more and see if you can still keep up with me. - Wait, no, I could never keep up with you. No. - Really? I forgot. - God. - Cheers, baby! - Yeah, all right, cheers. - Hey Alice. - I'll be right back. - If it isn't Alice Turner. - Hi John. - You look great. This is my friend Will, he was a grade below us. - Hi. - Hi Will. - Nice to meet you. I remember you. - So, are you back now? - I'm just visiting. - Yeah? How long’re you staying? - Not that long. - Maybe we could, you know, get together. Relive the old days? - Yeah, I don't think I wanna catch up on those. - Come on, we had some good times. - Maybe you did. - Wow, are you still mad at me? That girl Tracy was the biggest mistake I ever made. You're so much cooler. - I know. - Let me make it up to you, all right? - You know John, I can't think of a single thing you can do to make that up to me. - Well, I could think of a few things. Come on, gimme a chance. - I don't know. - Come on, give a guy a break! Let me take you out. - All right, when? - How's Tuesday sound? Listen, I gotta go, but I'll call ya, all right? - Whoa whoa whoa, are you OK? You OK? - I hate this place! - It's all right. - I used to drive circles around that guy's house at night for hours, just to be near him. But I never rang the door bell because I was afraid he would be in there with somebody else. - Come on, Alice. You knew that guy always had a lot of girls. - I know. I just thought I could be the one. - Well, I guess you weren’t, Alice. ♫ What's that deafening laughter ♫ I know, I know, I know ♫ Darling you are my master ♫ You're seeing my SOS ♫ Can we move any faster - Go on ahead, I'll be right up. ♫ I know, I know, I know, I know ♫ One more and I will scream, ♫ Things are much worse than they seem ♫ My hands are holding on ♫ - Where'd you get that? - One of Jim's old hiding places. I can't believe there's still shit to find in this house. - It's 'cause you weren't here now, to take care of it all. - That's very funny. Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador. Is this where he's going? - Yep. - Wow. There’s actually a picture where we’re all together. And Mom’s smiling, for once. This is just like that night when Mom went on the bridge. When Jim left her for good. You're still all wet. - Yeah, so are you. - I'm pretty glad you're here with us. Thought we lost you for a minute. - Yeah. - I swear that I don't know what I would do without you, David. - I’m right here, Alice. - You're more important to me than anyone in the world. I was always mad you got the prettier eyes. Morning. David, everything's gonna be OK. We're gonna have a really nice time while I'm here. And we can all go swimming. I can even take Dee and Jeffrey off your hands for a while so that you can do some writing. And then, later on, you guys can all come visit me, and that'll be really great because there's this museum in town, it's a kid's museum. It’s got all these crazy exhibits, and Dee and Jeffrey are gonna go nuts for it. - What the hell are you talking about? - David? Shit. - I can't get it out. - Dee, don't do that, you could get electrocuted. - But I want my toast. - Well, you have enough toast already. - David, the toast slipped out and now it’s dirty. - Then make some more. - We can't, Alice said so. - Damn it Dee, I didn't say that! I said you shouldn't stick your fingers in the toaster. But you know what? Go ahead! Get electrocuted! - I'm hungry. - Would everyone just shut up? Where's David going? - Nowhere. What do you mean she won't take any calls? Can you just tell her it's important? She's my fucking mother. OK well, when is she gonna be awake enough to... I'm sorry, when is she gonna have enough energy to speak with me?

Why is that? - 'Cause you never called me. - I'm sorry, I really meant to. - You did? What happened, you got finger paralysis? - Seriously, I've been thinking about you. - What have you been thinking about? - What are you drinkin'? - Bourbon. - Hey Lou, two beers. - Morning. - Morning David.

They can survive in the wild. - I wonder where they're going. - North probably. - I applied to a school in Oregon. - You did? - I got in. - So you're leaving? - Yeah, well I, I'm not moving in, I'm moving out. I'm selling the house. - So you knew the whole time, didn’t you? - No, I mean, no. I just found out I got into the program in Oregon. I was gonna stay here, with you, but I... - No, that's good. - It’s what I really wanna do. - Right, you should do that then. Good luck with that, I wish you the best. - What? No, David wait. - What? - Why don't you come with me? I mean, I don't think there's any reason for you not to. - I told you that I can't do that, I can't leave the kids. I have to take care of them. - I mean, why can't your sister take care of them? - No, that's not a good idea, she's not the most stable person. - Maybe the challenge would be good for her. I mean, she's an adult. - You don't know her, OK? You don't even know what you're talking about! Just stay out of it! - OK. All right well, looks like I will. - Yes. Yes! Yes!

He's gonna be just fine. - Hey. - If you don't wanna sleep alone tonight, you can come sleep with me, OK? - OK. - Jeffrey almost drowned, OK? - What are you talking about? - He's fine, but he fell in the river. - He can't swim. - He's all right. But you have to come back now, David. - No. Not while you're there. - I hate this! - God damn it Alice, you should've never come back. - Well you didn't seem to mind all that much, did you. - Fuck you. - What, you can't get it up for your little pet shop girl? I read your journal, David. I'm all over it! Hey, is John around? John Moss? - No, I haven't seen him. - I'll take a bourbon, straight up. ♫ Well here's the problem ♫ I guess I drained all the life from the bottle ♫ Again ♫ But still you're callin' ♫ Though I've met you ♫ - David. - So you still want me to come with you? - Mary? What are you doing here? - David took the afternoon off. - Why? - He said something about packing. Alice, are you all right? - All right, I won't be long. Alice. Alice, hey! Hey! Alice. Hey, Alice, wake up! Wake up! All right, all right, come here. Wake up, wake up. You're good, you're good. - David? David? - Don't leave me. - Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. - OK - David? - Fuck you, Alice. - Stop it David! - I was gonna go with her. I was gonna start a brand new life with someone, and you took it away from me. - You could've gone with her. All I did was come back home. - I was over you, don’t you get it? I was finally over you and you come back and you start everything up again. - But I love you, David. - Stop! - So let's look at the map. For the weekend, scattered showers continue all across the northeast. - What's on? - The weather, 60% chance of rain. - And next week, we'll see temperatures back to their normal highs and lows. And also, finally, see some real sunny days. Here's a look at our radar. Temperatures have been surprisingly high across our region. - I'm so sorry, David. - But now we're back into the pleasant 70's and 80's in the Illinois area. - Who picked this out? - Jeffrey. I know. 'Cause he said it would match your eyes. - Yes! - There's one more. - What's this? - That's actually yours from a long time ago. - I thought I'd lost this! Aw, look how little you were! - Yeah. ♫ Startin' to feel better ♫ Bring on the weather ♫ I feel well-prepared for anything. ♫ Boat loads of lightenin' ♫ Fire fighting ♫ Electric cinema in the air ♫ We are the ones who are never afraid ♫ - Hi Alice. - Hi. Sorry. - Here. - OK. It's Will, right? - Yep, yeah. You're still here? - Yeah, yeah. - So, how's it goin'? - It's goin' all right, thank you. Thank you. - Well, maybe I'll see ya around. - Yeah, maybe. Why don't we see if we can teach your doll how to swim? - She already does it. - Wanna try it? - But I want that. - OK, we'll get you your own ball tomorrow then, all right? - Look what Alice got me, David! - That's cool bud! Remember, always get two of everything. - It’s so cool out tonight. - It is. - You'll write to us from all the places you visit, right? - Yeah, I will. - We thought this would be good for when you're drinking coffee and driving. - Thanks, you guys. - You're welcome. - Hey, you be good, OK? Don't torture your sister. Come here. Thank you. Hey, none of that. You'll be fine, Alice. You'll do great. Come here. And don't forget to leave. - I need another fighting fish. - We don't sell those anymore. Hey you guys!
