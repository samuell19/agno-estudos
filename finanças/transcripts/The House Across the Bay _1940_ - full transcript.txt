Open up. - Got a card? I want to play a little roulette. - This is a private club. I know, but we're pals of Steve Larwitt. - Sorry, you got to be a member. I thought Larwitt ran this place. - Not the gambler's joint. He rents that out. Hey, Steve. They wouldn't let us in back there. - Why not? He said we had to be members. - And you mentioned my name? Yeah. Come on. Listen, if anybody mentions my name, let them in. But Steve .. - Never mind. Let them in. Alright, boys. I'll try it once more. Fifty on the black. Fourteen red. I guess I can't get lucky. Crawley, if this keeps up I'll have to raise your rent. If I get in any more suckers like you I'll be able to pay it. Why, I ought to .. Hey, Barney. What happened? One of the kids from the chorus sneezed as your gal was singing and broke us up. Well? She burned to a crisp and walked off. Of all the contemptible low-down things to do. Sorry. That sneeze just slipped out. Slipped out, nothing. You did it on purpose. Alright. I'm allergic to you. Why, you little snip. You're cheap, cheap. Cheap! Where is the birdseed? I'd have had that audience in the palm of my hand if you hadn't .. Which hand? Left or right? The hand that's about to slap you in the puss. Just a minute, Miss dimwit. I was silly enough to apologise. Now you want to make a thing out of it I'll give you a reason. You're a phony. You've a voice like 4 panes of cracked glass. And as much appeal as a can of embalming fluid. I could go further but that'll give you a rough idea of how I feel about you. I knew it. I knew it all the time. You're burned and jealous because Steve gave me the number to do instead of you. Oh. I didn't try quite as hard as you did. You couldn't get it no matter how hard you tried. Don't be putting any ideas in my head because I might take him away from you. You? Huh! Pardon me while I go out and have you fired. Listen Steve, it's either me or her. What are you talking about? Who? The little dame in the chorus who sneezed in the middle of my number. What do you want me to do, Babe? - Can her. Sitting there giving me a lot of lip. Wise-cracking about my voice. She said it sounded like 4 panes of cracked glass. On top of that she had the gall to say she was going to take you away from me. She said that? - Yeah. She said she was going after you. She did, huh? Well, tell her I want to see her. What have you got that gets them, Steve? - Stop conning me. Mr Larwitt would like to see you right away. Oh. I can see he's made you a very happy woman. Did you send for me? Yeah. I hear you are crazy about me. News travels awful fast. Why? Why does news travel fast? - No. Why are you crazy about me? Do I have to give a reason? Yeah. I like reasons. Well. It isn't because you're different. Oh, so you don't think I'm different? No. Hey, Barney. What will you have to drink? - Milk. What are you doing? Put it on for me? Why don't you let me finish? Milk and a jigger of rum. What kind of rum? The best. Get it and bring it over to my table. Come on. Over there. Now pick it up from there. From where? From where I'm not different. - Let's talk about something else. No. I want to talk about me. That's what I thought. Alright. A dame was silly enough to come and say I was going after you. Is that right? Yes. - And what did you do? I sent for you. That's just exactly what fifty million other guys would have done. What are you talking about? I've been around here for two weeks. Tonight, I say things that swell you up and it's the first time you notice me. You can see by that how different you are. I get it. I knew you would. Then you're not going to try to get me? Do I have to try? Oh .. you think I'm going after you? I wouldn't be a bit surprised. I wouldn't either. Boss. Oh, Barney. Will you go away from me. Can't you see I'm talking? Boss, dip in your pocket. See what your number is. What you talking about? The number. The number you bought from Crawley. Boy, you are really getting to be a pest. 4-3-5-6-1. - That's it. That's it. - Let me see that. Boss, you win the fifteen grand. You've brought me luck. I'm not selling out to anybody, Slant. He's offering me an awfully good price, Crawley. I'm not selling out to anybody. You understand that? Don't yell at me. I'm only his lawyer. Now look. Let me be your lawyer for a minute. I'll give you some good advice free. If you don't sell the place to him. He'll only take it away from you. - No he won't. I've got a lease. Sure you got a lease. But I don't think it would stand up, in a court of law. Not for your racket. Do you? I want to okay this. Who is the guy? - The guy on that table alone. Okay. Is Slant still in there? - I think he is, boss. How do you like it? - Going in for tuxedos now, eh? Sure. Get the cut of that. It set me back a yard and a half. That's different. Who are you? Come back here. Don't walk out on a crack like that. What do you mean? Listen, Steve. You and me have been friends for a long time. What's eating you? Up to last week you seemed satisfied. I am. Then why are you taking over Crawley's joint? Oh. You're sore because I want to be somebody? That's all, kid. Goodnight. Steve. News for you. - Well? Do I take it or do I pay for it? - You are paying for it. Okay by me. - And it was Crawley's too. Was he? Let's have a drink. What will you have, gentlemen? I don't like the way you are saying "gentlemen". What will you have, boys? Better? I don't think you feel it. What's yours, the usual? No. Not this time, Barney. I think the occasion calls for champagne. Yeah, that's it. I nice big quart of champagne. Do you mind if I put a Mickey in it? Why, I ought to .. Shush, Slant. Say, Barney. Send that bottle of wine over to the table. Come on. "Agua Caliente." "I'll never forget." "Agua Caliente." "That is where I bought a pet." "A little toy. Oh boy oh boy." "My Chihuahua." "He is my pride." "And joy." "How I love to promenade by walking my Chihuahua." "People stop and stare almost everywhere when I'm walking my Chihuahua." "Other dogs are jealous because the fellahs keep petting my Chihuahua." "So he isn't much protection, that's why they show their affection." "For me." "Woof, woof, woof." "Bow wow, wow." "Bonita, Bonita." "Woof, woof, woof." "Negrita, Negrita." That's very nice. Where did you get her? She came in on a sneeze. I wouldn't mind buying her an ammonia jacket. Give me a piece of paper and a pencil, Slant. Give this to Lucky, the minute she is finished. What is it? But this is crazy. Why, you went over with a bang. Say, you don't think it means Babe is coming back? I don't know but I'm going to find out awful fast. Barney, where is Steve? He's outside, thinking. He can't think in here anymore. Smoke gets in his eyes. Hey, Lucky. What's this all about? Go round the side and get in. - I'll not get in. What does this mean? What it says. So you were building me up for a let-down. Is that what you're doing? Why not get in? I want to talk to you. I'm not getting in. You can talk from there. Get in. Everybody will hear us. What I am about to say to you the whole world can hear. Come here. Listen. I got something better for you. Oh, I get it. If it means dressing me in a fur coat to take a Pekingese for walks in a park .. No thank you. I want to know why I am fired. Because I don't want my wife on exhibition. What? You are going to marry me. Really? How'd you figure all that out? What do you think I've been doing for the past week? Taking you home and leaving you at the front door. You are trying out a new angle. I was. Now I've made up my mind. Listen. I've got a mind too. All that stuff about taking you away from Babe was just a gag. Forget it. That might be the way it started. The kidding is over. Steve. And you can't start all this with me and then walk out. You've only known me a week. A week. A year. You've hit me and time has got nothing to do with it. When I met you, something happened. It was like finding part of myself had been missing. That's always been missing. You and me are right for each other. Can't you see that, Lucky? I don't know, Steve. I don't know. - You are going to know. I'm busting through for you. I'll give you all you ever dreamed of and things you never even thought of. I'm not looking for things, Steve. You can't miss them. They go with you. And I was meant to get them for you. Don't let me down, Lucky. [ Buzzer ] [ Buzzer ] Hello? No. Madame left about 15 minutes ago. I think she went to the Margaret Adams beauty shop. Did she get a package before she left? She did, Mr Larwitt. No. I didn't see her open it. Goodbye. Excuse me gentlemen for walking out on you. But I have some very important business to attend to. Now, let's see. Where were we? We were telling you to lay off Elmer Distillery. Oh yes. You were telling me. And Taresca means it, Steve. Is that all? You've got plenty of other interests. Gambling, race tracks. This broker's joint that you're using for a blind. You forgot to mention my gun-running. We know all about your rackets, Steve. This distillery is a legitimate business. That's what appeals to me. Well, Taresca is not going to let you play safe at his expense. He is not letting you in. He built the Elmer Distillery up from nothing. If you are so anxious, why don't you start one yourself? My pioneering days are over. So is this audition. Get me the Margaret Adams beauty parlor. I wouldn't dismiss this too lightly, Steve. You are not dealing with a tin-horn gambler. Taresca is a very important man. Oh, that's a matter of opinion. Okay. What do you want us to tell Taresca? Tell him to start looking for a new business. Hand me that briefcase, Slant. Steve. I think you are making a mistake. Taresca did build up Elmer Distillery from a hole in the wall. It isn't going to be so easy to throw him out. Isn't it? [ Buzzer ] Hello. Is Mrs Larwitt there? What time is she expected? Oh. She has cancelled her appointment. Thanks. You see, this is one of those times when it might pay to use caution. Caution makes you think. I like action. You know these quiet evenings have been getting on my nerves. Yeah, but .. This Taresca is a dangerous guy and besides, he's got the law on his side. He had the law on his side. What do you mean, "had"? I bought 50,000 shares of its stock today. Elmer Distillery? 50,000. Plus what I've been picking up the last few weeks .. Gives you control. Boy. What a brain. You dog. Putting one over on me like that. I couldn't wait for you to get home tonight to thank you. Were you surprised, baby? I thought I had to call the fire department for an alert. Did you like it? - Do I like it? Slant, he asked me if I liked it. In all your life have you ever seen anything so beautiful? What is it, your anniversary or birthday or something? Does it have to be a birthday for me to give her something? Steve, you've never given me anything as lovely. Don't you think it's spoiling me just a little bit? What's wrong with that? Can't you take it? How have I done so far? Oh, just fair. Step back there a minute. Let's look at you. Slant. Take eight or ten more looks at that. Is that something? You'd never think she came out of a farm in Indiana, would you. Thanks to you. Thanks to you. - And thanks to you. Now, listen. Before you two smother each other in orchids, may I ask .. All I want to say is you're both amazing and you both owe it all to each other. Do you think you're kidding? - Is he insulting us? Yeah. Calling us amazing when all we want to be is different. Come on, darling. Let's have some lunch. I got to keep you healthy. Oh no, not you, Slant. We don't want any habeas corpus mixed up in our salad. Do we, Lucky? [ Singing: ] "I still love to kiss you goodnight." "The thrill of you holding me tight." How was that? Terrible. You sounded like a woodpecker that swallowed its nest. Now, listen to me. "I still love to kiss you goodnight." "The thrill of you holding me tight." Better? - Oh, awful. What are you trying to do? Give me an inferiority complex? I won't need you until 11 in the morning, Jim. Okay. - Goodnight. Steve. Taresca, eh boss? - Steve, are you hurt? Nothing, baby. Somebody thought it was the 4th July. [ Buzzer ] Yeah? "Mrs Larwitt is here to see you." Send her in. Hello Brenda. - Hello, Slant. You're out early. Where's Steve? - Sleeping as if nothing had happened. What a guy. - Who is Taresca? Taresca? - Yes. Well, he's .. just a fellow Steve has been talking to. Talking what? - Talking business. Oh. So it's Taresca? It's Taresca who's out to get him isn't it? I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. I'd worry about it if I was Taresca. When shots start buzzing around I think it is time to worry. They missed him, didn't they? - Don't give the same argument he did. Just because they missed him last night is no sign they won't keep trying. They'll get him if he sticks around here long enough. He is too sure of himself. - I don't know. Steve seems to think that he is a man of destiny. Maybe he is. Isn't there something you can do? I wish there was something I could do. But then you know Steve. You know him better than I do. - What kind of a lawyer are you? Ask Steve. He can tell you better than I can. I am sorry. I didn't mean that. I don't know what I meant. It's just that .. Something has got to be done about Steve and I thought maybe you'd have an angle. Forget it. Don't tell Steve I was here. - Of course not. If anything occurs to me I'll ring you. Thanks. [ Buzzer ] The income-tax people are on their way over, Mr Kolma. No. He said it wasn't corporation tax. It's Mr Larwitt's personal income-tax. Yes, sir. Here I am again, doctor. Say, Slant. How is the income-tax business coming along? With Steve, I mean. Oh. We're okay. It's just a matter of steering them right. That's all. Pardon me. No. There was nothing serious to that. Could it be serious? I don't know what you mean. You mean .. Was there any chance of them hanging something onto Steve? Come on now, Slant. I know Steve's been jumping the government. If they caught him, what would he get? What would he get? What kind of a sentence, I mean. Oh. They couldn't catch him. Steve is too smart. I am too smart. Just suppose they did catch him. Well. It wouldn't cost him much as those things go. A hunk of dough, maybe. Would they send him away? Yeah, probably. Wouldn't be for long. How long? Oh .. a year. Tops. A year? Uhuh. That's all. The new boy up on Lucky looks okay doesn't he, Brenda? Yes, he seems to know how to handle him. Mr Larwitt? - Yes. I am Britten of the Federal Bureau Of Investigation. We'd like you to come down to the office with us. Slant, come here. I want to talk to you. A couple of G-Men. I am Mr Larwitt's attorney. What do you want? We will discuss that at the office. After all, it is Saturday afternoon. Can't it be postponed until Monday? Afraid not. The chief has to fly back to Washington tonight. You'd better come along, Slant. - Yes. Sure. Brenda, something came up that's very important. I must return to the office. Hanson. Look after my wife, will you. Be glad to. Bye, sweet. Oh, Hanson. Don't forget you're having dinner with us tonight. Right. Oh, we've won, darling. We've won. Wonderful. Gee, what a lucky guy that husband of yours is. Steven Larwitt, have you anything to say before sentence is passed? Nothing. Except I wouldn't be here if I wasn't framed. I'm not going to talk about the law very much. This trial has served to uncover 3 or 4 years of your spectacular record. The law was something for you to juggle .. and laugh at. You made your own rules. And you made others around you live by them. Ruthlessly and without scruple. You are not fit for a normal society under normal rules. It is the sentence of this court .. That you be confined in the Federal prison at Alcatraz for a period of .. Ten years. The court is adjourned. Ten years? Brenda. Did you hear that, Brenda? Ten years. Ten years. A stiff sentence. It's a wonder he didn't get twenty years the way Slant Kolma handled the case. Steve. Steve! Steve. Ten years. What about you? Now, Brenda. It's done. There is no use carrying on .. - You said a year. You did. You said a year. You can't always tell about these things. Oh, what a fool I was to believe in you. What a stupid fool I was to let you defend him. Look what you've done to him! Look what I've done to him? Whatever I did was to save his life. I wanted him where I knew he would be safe. Now Brenda, I understand. I'm sorry. You meant well. Please, stop blaming yourself. Blaming myself? What's going to happen to you now, Lucky? Don't worry about me, Steve. I get dizzy, thinking. You out there alone. Who framed me? I can't figure it out. I keep going over the list. If I ever get my hands on him, I'll .. Why can't Slant find out? I must tell you something. Who did this to us? Who framed us? Ten years without you. I can't take it. Steve, it isn't as if they'd killed you. - Killed me? That's what they've done. A slow, rotten death. I can't take it. I won't. Don't talk that way. Don't. You mustn't even think that way. I can't help it. I can't go on without you, baby. It's like taking my breath out of my body. I just can't do it. Brenda. Now, there is no sense in your trying to avoid me. We've nothing to say to each other. - Brenda. This superior attitude of yours isn't helping things any. Now, Steve has left everything in my hands. I want to do all I can for you. You've done all you can for me. - I did the best I could, Brenda. You did your best alright. But it wasn't for Steve. - What do you mean by that? You're much too clever to have anything definite pinned on you. But how was it that every deal Steve was ever in was dragged into that trial? He was only up for income-tax. Now Brenda, that's so involved it would take an awfully long time to explain. Just as long as it takes to say "double-cross". That is very funny coming from you. Stay away from me, Slant. Far away. I don't want to see you again. Now, Brenda. I know you are upset or wouldn't have said anything so foolish. You and I are bound to see each other again. After all, we have a secret. Go on, driver. Jerry, I want you to keep an eye on her. Let me know what goes on. How many will there be? - I'm alone. My husband will ask for references. How long do you expect to be gone? About six months. Will six months rent in advance help? Six months would help considerably. We've never put up curtains because of the view. But you may have them if you like, Miss ..? I didn't get your name. Bentley. Brenda Bentley. And I like the window just as it is. This way please. He'll be right here. Talk through that microphone. You only have ten minutes. Steve. Hello, baby. Have I been counting the days. You are looking fine, Steve. So much better than I expected. Oh. How do you like my new suit? It's not bad at all. It really fits you very well. - Quit conning me. There's 375 just like it. You can't say I'm different now. You will always be different, Steve. Don't forget to tell that to the warden on the way out. Tell me. How is the new apartment? Is it nice? Has it got enough room? - Very comfortable and cheerful. High up on Telegraph Hill. You can see right across the bay over here. It makes me feel close to you. Does it? Just knowing you're there honey, makes all the difference in the world. You'll never know. Now tell me. What do you do? I'm a hardworking man. I'm learning a profession. Steve, that's marvelous. What is it? Something I wanted to do all my life. You mean you are studying law? - That's right. In the laundry. You ought to see me prosecute those bedsheets. When you laugh .. Say. Where is your jewelry? You are getting your money from Slant every month, aren't you? I didn't think it would be the thing to wear it over here. Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's right. Tell me, Steve. Have you everything you want? Is there anything you want me to get you? Baby. There isn't anything more you can do for me. Just as long as I can look across and figure that you are there .. That's enough for me. Well, I see the good humor man is here. That means I have to go back to my law practice. Come on, baby. Right through here. Goodbye, Steve. Until next time. Goodbye, honey. Get up from there. Do you think all I've got to do is to wash them pants? Just like his old man. Wants to be public enemy number two. Thanks be we only have to do this once a month. My old man killed me today he was so sorry for himself. My guy was sorry too. He's been making mail sacks for the government. And the food. Of course, he's only been in the can twelve years. Only just now he develops a new idea. The food is getting monotonous. You know he asked me to write to the Attorney General .. To pardon the cook to get rid of him. Bill says the food at Leavenworth is much better. Say, who is the Duchess over there? Oh, just another Jenny with a Johnny on the rock. That's Steve Larwitt's wife. Yeah? I hear he's nuts about her. I'll lay you six to an even she don't stick to him six months. Judging everybody by yourself? I think I'll go over and break her down. First crossing? Cigarette? No thanks. Come on. Do you good. Thanks. I'm Mary Bogale. I've been crossing on this luxury liner for two years. There is one consolation. It's not as rough as the English Channel. And the view isn't bad if you look in the right direction. Where you staying? I have a little apartment up on the hill. If you ever get tired of it you might try the Colony Hotel. That's where most of us stay. It's cheap. And they don't ask embarrassing questions. How long you going to stay? Ten years. Well then, we'd better start getting acquainted. Because after seven years you won't be seeing me anymore. Seven more years. - Ah, that's a trifle. Get a load of those rock widows over there. Together, they are doing a good five hundred years. With good behaviour. Just relax and have one of these. It will do you good. No thank you. You've been cooped up here for a couple of months. Why don't you step out and have a little fun for yourself? He ain't worrying himself about you. That's where you are wrong. Besides. I'm not going to let anything or anybody interfere with my plans .. To carry this thing through in my own way. You didn't slip up on a thing did you. Got as close as you could get. You took the curtains down so you could get a better view. Even fixed your bed so the Alcatraz spotlight lets you take baths all night. You ain't the little woman that's chained to the rock, are you? What I am doing is my own business. You don't have to get sore. Gee, I'm sick of people picking up small things I say and making mountains of it. Alright. Let's talk about something else. Okay. Let's go to the Ritz Curzon. What do we want at the Ritz Curzon? What do we want? You know what they got at the Ritz Curzon? The best liquor in town. And they got a sky room full of phony stars and .. The best people in San Francisco. That's us out. We don't belong with the best people. What do you mean, "we don't belong"? Say, who is doing the time, you or him? I told you to mind your own business. I don't have to explain anything to you. To me? Not a thing. But I want to tell you something. When that double-chin moves in and the inner-tubes start to pop under the eyes. You're going to have a lot of explaining to do to yourself about your lost youth. And you know what the answer will be? Yes, I've got the answer. - But you ain't got the right one. I'm going to give it to you. All levelled off. You've spent the best years of your life sat on Telegraph Hill, all by yourself. Waiting for a guy who was so smart he didn't have sense enough to go straight. He got himself in there, just like my man. We didn't put him in there. I need some more whiskey. I'm going to make you some coffee. - No, you're not. I came up here to have a good time, and what do I get? All churned up. I'm going home. - Let me call you a taxi. No. I'll go the way I came. A streetcar is good enough for me. Alright, I'll walk to the corner with you. Do you think I need an escort? Alright then, I won't go. Oh. Ashamed to walk with me, huh? Mary. Did anyone ever try to strangle you? Sure. And I love it. Come on, kid. Walk to the streetcar with me. "When I saw you last night and got that .." "Old feeling." "When you came inside I got that .." You know, that was Joe's favorite. He loved music. I could always tell when he was going to crack a safe. He sang so much. "I saw you last night .." - Shush. Not so loud. It's late. Crab apple. "I saw you last night and got that .." Look at that. Serves your right. Now I'll have to get you a taxi. Come on. Where is your telephone? - Right over there. Thanks. Alright. I'll phone Ed right away. Say, have you got a lease on that thing? It's for the public. What do we look like, a couple of aliens? Come on, hurry up. We want a taxi. - Hello. Is that you, Ed? Look, if you hear from Morley. What about the exhaust? I can see this is going to go on and on. When a selfish guy like that gets there. No, no, no. No. About the exhaust. The exhaust! - Mary, please. So, did you hear from Morley? Ask Morley if he got that toupee I sent him. Can you be quiet, please? I can't hear a word you say, Ed. There is a dame here loaded with fire-water. You are a liar. I never was drunk in my life and I can prove it. I hate guys like that. Always trying to put a woman in her place. Mary, come on. There is a taxi. Yeah? Our usual good luck. He'll be through phoning in a minute. We'll call another taxi. See what you done, you and Ed Morley? You sure fixed us up. Now it will be all hours before I get home and me without a heel on my shoe. Wait a minute. Say, you got a car? Yes. How about a little lift? After all, it's your fault. Mary, come on. I'm terribly sorry if I caused all this trouble. I'll be glad to take you anywhere you want to go. No thank you. What do you mean, no thank you? Wasn't he nice enough to offer us a lift? Of course we'll go. We'll be very glad to have you take us home. Where is your car? Right here. Is this it? I find it very handy for carrying the groceries. Come on Brenda, it's alright. He's a grocery man. Won't you come? - No thank you. I don't think I will. You're not going to let your friend go home alone un-chaperoned? I think she is quite capable of taking care of herself. What about me? I might need some help. She seems a woman of many moods. I'm sure you can manage her. Hey, what are you two doing? Talking behind my back? Come on, let's get going. No, Mary. I'm going to walk. I live just a few blocks from here. It is rather late. - I don't mind. Really. Come on, grocery man! You've got a delivery to make. "I saw you last night." Are you going to leave me alone with that woman? - Yes. I'll never forgive you. "Last night .." Goodnight, Mary. Still resisting, huh? Okay kid, I'll be seeing you on the upper deck. Goodnight, and thanks very much. Goodnight. She is very attractive. That's what makes here tough. Who is she? I ain't telling you. - Come on, who is she? Can I talk to you? - Certainly. Well, she's a little girl who came out here to get away from her family. A lovely family. Her father is Senator Fosgrave of Nevada. A big mining man. And her mother is one of the Arlingtons of the Arlington cemetery. She has been in great pain in the last few years. A tombstone fell on her. Come on, be a good fellow. Who is she? That is something you will never get out of me. Oh, my head. Please don't pick on me today. I don't want anyone to have my phone number. That's why it's not in the book. I tell you I didn't give it to him. So how did he manage to call last night? - He did? Oh. That's funny. What else did you tell him? I suppose you gave him my name. He was so persistent. Did you tell him where I live? Absolutely not. He tried. But that is the one thing I held out on. A package for Miss Bentley. Come on, Smitty. Follow that guy there. Go on. Oh, that cheap liquor. Why do I do it? Because you are just crazy about bicarbonate of soda. Can you imagine that dirty skunk firing just because I was an hour late. As if any guy would want his nails manicured at 9 o'clock in the morning. If that isn't a dog I'm looking at, I'll never take another drink, so help me. Well, hello. Why, you cute fellow. Where did you come from? He wandered in here with the delivery man. The man says he ain't his'un. Ah, so you are out doing the own on your own, are you? I wouldn't encourage him, Miss Bentley. You know, you rent this apartment furnished. You know nothing about that dog. He's liable to make you pay out more money than you got. He must be lost. I bet someone is having a fit. Come on, Smitty. I going to phone and see that you get home. Thank you. I tell my master right away. 21 Telegraph Hill. - I know. Goodbye Smitty, old boy. It was nice knowing you. Smitty, what do you mean, running away? I was quite worried. Thanks very much, Miss Bentley. Of all the petty, conniving .. I know, I know. It was collegiate and underhanded but .. You forced me into it. Mind if I sit down? I am exhausted. Do you realise this manoeuvring has taken up practically my entire morning? Didn't I make it definite last night? Very definite. Come away, Smitty. Come away from Miss Bentley there, Smitty. She doesn't like us. Come on. Come on over here. Come on over here, Smitty. That's the boy. Now, when a lady makes it obvious she wants to be left alone. We must respect her wishes. Apparently, Miss Bentley is very choosy about her friends. And I'm afraid you and I aren't to be included among them. You know, all this chit-chat with Smitty isn't going to do you a bit of good. Come on old boy. We are going to have to accept our defeat. Too bad, as it would have been very pleasant .. To have taken her for a ride in our new C6. Smitty. I think you ought to kiss Miss Bentley goodbye .. Because she looks very, very ravishing in her little yellow jacket. Go on now. No. No, Smitty. Smitty, don't listen to him. No, no. Call him away. No. Don't .. Easy now, boy. Easy. Call him off please. Oh, I thought this would be all over by now. I'm sorry. Is that the plane you were talking about? Yes. Oh, will you pardon me just a minute? - Of course. Go right ahead. I'll be right back. How do you do, gentlemen. Hello Tim. We were hoping you'd be here. [ French language ] Well, I got portion of what he's saying but not all of it. He is quite excited about your plane, Mr Nolan. He says it is the fastest thing he has ever flown. Tell me, Mr Nolan. Can it be converted into a light combat plane? Well, it wasn't designed with that in mind but .. The structure would accommodate a gun-mount. We would require a twin gun-mount. Can you provide for that without affecting the speed? Yes. Yes, that can be done alright. [ French language ] I'm terribly sorry to leave you alone but I'll only be a minute. This is quite a discovery, mister grocery man. Mr Nolan. Can you give us a tentative delivery date? How many planes would you want? - Two hundred. Let's see. Five weeks of engineering working the men in three shifts. The factory should be ready in a couple of months. After that I can turn out between 16 and 17 a week. That will be satisfactory. That you very much, gentlemen. Wally. Have Reeves get the blueprints for that new engine and I'll see him later. That's over. Let's take a look at the ship. I've been looking at it. But you can't see it from here. Come on. How do you like it? I like the color of the upholstery. Well, the interior decorator will be very pleased to hear that. Come. We're going for a ride. Oh no. You talked me into coming to see this thing but I'm not going for a ride. You know. I can't understand a smart, up-to-date girl like you never going up in a plane. Well some people don't like tapioca pudding. Afraid? I like to keep my feet on the ground. Quit dodging. You are afraid. You know what you must do when you're afraid of something? Yes. Avoid it. No .. face it. In you go. Come on, in you go. That's the girl. Contact. Look out there and watch the ground slipping away. Don't miss any of it. You see it? Yes. How does it feel now? Lovely. Down here you can see the bridge. All those cars going across. They look like a lot of little ants don't they. Yes. That's what flying does to you. Gives you a new perspective. Unimportant things don't exist and important things seem trivial. Turn that valve to the right. Glad you came? I feel better now. If anything goes wrong I can get out and walk. I'm afraid you wouldn't find that white stuff very safe. It's wonderful up here. It's all so clean. Ah, there is nothing like it. Makes you feel proud of something that is tremendous. Makes you know that people were meant to be decent .. And fine and big. Look, you can see Alcatraz. How some of those poor devils down there would envious up here. Free to go wherever we care to. What's going on in that quiet mind of yours now? Here is to the lady .. who never tells. She has built a high fence. And behind it she dwells. A poor guy is struggling to .. Scale the high fence. And .. But when he gets over .. It won't make any sense. Well Brenda, this is a pleasant surprise. Slant. Oh. Mr Kolma - Mr Nolan. Mr Nolan. - Glad to know you. That's Tim Nolan, isn't it? Yes, I've heard a good deal about you. I was fortunate enough to get some of that Crane stock before it went up. How long have you been in town, Slant? - Oh, just a few days. Won't you have a drink with us, Mr Kolma? We're celebrating Miss Bentley's first trip in the air. Oh, is that so? Well, that is very fortunate for you, Brenda. To get such an excellent pilot as Mr Nolan for your first trip in the air. We're going to make a first-class pilot out of her. How about a drink? No, I'm sorry. I have an appointment. As a matter of fact I'm late now, but .. It has been awfully nice to see you again, Brenda. Very nice to have met you. Mr Nolan. - Bye. Goodbye. You know, I meant what I said about making a flyer out of you. How about the first lesson tomorrow morning? I am afraid not. What is the matter? My head feels rather strange. Maybe it was the altitude. Oh no, it isn't the altitude. It is the earth that doesn't agree with you. I'm terribly sorry but I think I had better go. Of course. I'll drive you right home. - No. Please just call a taxi. Waiter. Oh, Miss Bentley. I have a message for you. A Mr Kolma called just few minutes ago. He said he would expect you at the Ritz Curzon at 7:30. Room 1220. Thank you, Lydia. Hello Brenda. Come on in. You know, I didn't get a chance this afternoon to say how wonderful you look. What do you want? Well, we haven't seen each other in such a long time. As an old friend, naturally, I'm anxious to know how you are getting along. Won't you sit down, Brenda? I .. I would have come out here sooner but .. I thought I'd just give you a chance to get adjusted. What is it you want? I have a little bad news for you. You haven't any more money. The government tabbed it off of back income-taxes. What about the money you raised on my jewels? That helped pay for Steve's defense. - Steve's defense? We won't go into that again. You have nothing to worry about. You can still have everything you want. How? I can let you have some cash. A loan, you mean? No. Just call it a gift. No strings? Well, maybe. Slant, you don't know if Steve is out there. You know, the same thought occurred to me when I saw you with Tim Nolan. Tim Nolan doesn't mean a thing to me. I'm on the level with Steve and he knows it. So Steve knows about Nolan? You told him? It's none of your business what I tell Steve. Brenda, I'm sorry we have to get so ill-tempered about this. After all .. I love you. I always have and you know it. Now let's down to cases. You and I will never get down to cases so don't fool yourself. Well. You know, that's an awfully tough place over there they tell me. Still, I'd hate to be the man that tried to stop Steve if he decided to leave. Steve has changed. He is quiet. He takes it all in his stride now. He knows I'm waiting for him and he knows that's all that matters. Yes, I suppose so. Still, I can't help wondering what Steve would do if somebody told him .. Who framed him. You know, who put him over there. Have you said everything you have to say? No. No. Just suppose that I let my hair down for a minute. Now listen, Brenda. Do you think I enjoyed knifing Steve back there at the trial? Yes, I do. Well, you are wrong. I was really a pretty good egg until you came into the picture. I wanted you just as honestly as Steve did. But Steve got you. And I am not any .. Happier about it than you are. I've been miserable since the first time I saw you. If I have to jail Steve for life, if I have to smear the lives of all of us .. Alright. I am ready to go. I .. Just wanted to let you know what you're in for, Brenda. You are a born lawyer, Slant. You can pin up your hair now. It doesn't become you. Very well, Brenda. I'm planning on staying around awhile until I see how things come out. If you need any cash or anything, just .. Give me a ring. Well, now you know all of it. Hey kid, I'm sorry I shot my mouth off the way I did. I can see it now. If I'd put my man over there I'd have stayed up at that house and moped too. I've got to get away from there. Yeah. But that skunk of a mouthpiece will follow you no matter where you go. Can't you see that? It wasn't just accidental that he walked into that restaurant today. Those guys are pretty slick. I can't let Nolan get mixed up in this. Imagine the grocery man turning out to be that Nolan. Say, maybe he can help you. No, no. Don't you see? He's the reason I must get away. So he can't find me. Now that Slant knows about him he'll stop at nothing. And Tim Nolan can't be dragged into a mess like this. So you've fallen for him? I'm not falling for anyone. Steve is my man and that is the way it is going to be. There isn't going to be anyone else. Ever. I'm very sorry. But you don't just turn those things on and off. They happen. And there isn't much that you can do about it. Well it isn't going to happen to me. I won't let it happen. I've got to find a job. But it can't be right here in San Francisco. It's got to be away. Someplace where nobody goes. Yeah. Where nobody goes. Nobody ever goes to Alameda. Now who do I know in Alameda? You're next. Have a seat. I am just waiting to see Miss Bogale. Hello. How did you find me? Through your hotel. I know what you want and I don't know anything about it. Mary. Where is she? I don't know. Maybe Senator Fosgrave sent for her. You know, this is the busy diplomatic season in Washington. Come on, tell me. You're not going to get it out of me. What's the idea of leaving a regular customer with that stuff on his hands? Look at the guy. He's not going any place. Sorry if I got you in wrong. Please. Tell me where she is. I gave her my word. It means an awful lot to me. You're not going to get anything out of me. Of course, if you happen to go to Alameda .. But Alameda is a pretty large place. Can I help it if a lot of people are dumb enough to live there? Ouch! You can't take it, huh? - No, and I live in Alameda. "I get certain feelings that I never had before." "First I'm getting feelings, then I'm crying on the floor." "What did you do?" "What." "Did." "You." "Do ..?" "You made me." "Fall .. in .. love." "So I say." "I never will again." "Still, I always want that thrill again." "When my lover comes along." "He'll be right." "And I'll be wrong again." "When he holds me." "In his warm embrace." "Then I know my pulse will start to race." "For my heart is his to rule." "And I know I'll be a fool." "Again." "How can I hide this strange fascination?" "This temptation." "Is stronger than I." "Though I'm sure he'll make me cry again." "I've just got to see that guy again." "Though his love for me may cool." "Until I know I'll be a fool." "Again." Say Charlie, buy me a drink? Sure. Hey, waiter. What will you have? - Scotch and soda. Hurry up, hurry up. You know, the first time I saw you .. Oh, hello. Could I speak to you a moment? - Sure. Grab a chair and sit down. Charlie won't mind, will you Charlie? Give em a light. Buy him a drink. What will you have? - Scotch and soda please. Hey Gus. Another Scotch and soda. How is Smitty? - He's fine. Smitty? - His dog. Charlie, he's got the most marvelous dog. He does all kinds of tricks. What kind of a dog is he? A Great Dane. I don't like Danes. They're dumb. This one isn't. Of course, he makes mistakes. Occasionally. Is he smart enough to know when he does make a mistake? What is this dog talk? I thought you came here to tell her something. Here is to a twosome that became a threesome. It could go back to a twosome. If we could some minutes alone. Oh, you can say whatever you have to say in front of Charlie. You and I have no secrets. What is this all about? What do you mean? - Is it necessary? I work here and I like it. I am sorry if it doesn't quite come up to your standard. But I .. What's the matter? Ain't this place good enough for him? I guess not. Why you .. - Come on, Charlie. Let's dance. Gee Kid, you got a lot of fire. Alright, Charlie. That's enough. What's the idea? We just started. Get out of my way. Hello, Brenda. I was wondering if you were going to be here today. It must mean a great deal to Steve to see you looking so lovely. Oh. How is the job going at the Sorrento? It wasn't very nice of you to move away without letting me know. Kolma? - Right here. Mrs Larwitt? - Here. Would you two like to go in together? - Yes, we would. This way, please. Take that booth. Look, I .. I don't want Steve to know the money is gone. He mustn't know I'm working. Yes. Yes, I know. Sit down. Hello, Slant. What are you doing out here? How are you, Steve. I just came out on a case. There are a lot of things I've got to talk to you about. Hello, honey. Prettier than ever, isn't she, Slant? You are seeing that she gets everything she wants? Everything she wants she can get. Ah, that's swell. Now that you're in town you can take her out to some shows and dinner. Sure. I'd be glad to. You know, it's been kinda tough on her. She doesn't know anyone. I'll bet you were glad to see Slant, huh? Now look, honey. Will you step over there a minute? There is a thing I must talk to him about. Oh no. I'm going to be in on everything. Will you do as I tell you. Alright then, you're grabbing a surprise. The 26th is her birthday. I want you to go out and buy her a nice little roadster. Didn't I tell you the surprise would fall flat? Now wouldn't it have been better if you'd gone over there? But Steve, I .. I don't need a car. I'd rather walk. You know, those hills are good for the hips. Slant. You do as I tell you. Funny. Us three back together again. It seems a long time. Uh .. How they treating you? Well, I enjoyed the winters in Miami better. By the way. It's taking you a long time to catch up with who framed me. How about it? We're still working on it. Nine more years and six months in this hole. Without her. You got to find who pulled this on me. - Steve. Rough him up, you understand? Steve, listen. I don't like to leave you like this. It makes me unhappy. How did you like the sweater I sent you? It's too big. It's the first thing I ever made. I'll have to knit you another one. Make the neck smaller. Come on now, Steve. Okay, baby. She can do anything she wants with me. Time is up. Well I .. I'll see you before you go back, Slant? - 0h, sure. I'll be over again. Goodbye, Steve. Until next time. If I didn't know what they would do to me. I'd strike through this glass and take you in my arms. Goodbye, honey. Look after her, Slant. - I will. I was surprised to see Steve looking so well. I never dreamed he could take it this way. It's wonderful what you are doing for him, Brenda. It would be too bad if he ever lost faith in you. Steve is never going to lose faith in me. That's all he has left. I'm not letting him down. Well of course Brenda, that is for you to decide. How about having dinner with me tonight? If you are hesitating on account of Tim Nolan .. You can dismiss that because I dropped in to see him. You would stop at nothing. Yes, that's right. Where you are concerned, I wouldn't. I have told you that I love you. And I don't think that you are in any position to continue to ignore that. I might stop in at The Sorrento tonight. It would nice to hear you sing again. Slant Kolma told me he saw you. Uhuh. Then you know who I am? - Yes. Why have you come here? Because who you are or where you've come from means nothing to me. You're wrong, Tim. You forget Steve. You can't sacrifice ten years of your life. Don't put it like that. You don't know Steve. He is where he is because he trusted people too much. People who told him they loved him. Now he's over there across the bay. Counting the hours until he can come back to me. But we love each other. I knew it that first day in the plane. It's all so hopeless, Tim. Steve Larwitt loves me too. More than anything else in his life. The one thing that keeps him from going to pieces is his faith in me. I just can't let him down. No. Open 61. A break. Hello? There's been a break, honey. And it's your man. I didn't frame you, Steve. Slant double-crossed both of us. When I saw you were in danger I had to find a way to save you from Taresca. Slant said you would only get a year. He crossed you up in your defense. He told enough to get you .. Ten years. Go ahead, Steve. I'm not afraid. Don't put your hands on her. She loves you, Larwitt. And I know you love her. I happen to love her too. But she has stuck by you. And has from the very beginning. Why do you suppose she is working in a dump like this? And how much money do you think you have left? Not a dollar. Slant Kolma has taken everything. Even her jewellery. He offered her help. His kind of help. And he went so far as to threaten me with .. Come on, Steve. We must get out of here before they find you. All ready for your second number, Miss Bentley. Steve, wait outside. And be careful. You have to hurry, Miss Bentley. I'll be right out. Brenda. You can't do this. The whole country will be looking for this man. They'd kill you both. I must get some money. I'll meet you in an hour at the corner of Union Square. I've got a right. I've got a right, Steve. - You have a right to say your prayers. [ 2x gunshots! ] Goodbye, baby. You are still tops with me. Morning paper! Morning paper! Paper, lady? Paper? Morning paper. All about Steve Larwitt. Morning paper. Where did they get him, kid? - Found him in the bay. They killed him. Give me one. What a sucker the guy is to try and escape from Alcatraz. Nobody ever made it. - You said it. Morning paper! All about Steve Larwitt .. Do you suppose this gentleman would mind changing places with me? (Ro_s)
