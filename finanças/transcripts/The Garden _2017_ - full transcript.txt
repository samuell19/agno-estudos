THE GARDEN Today of all days. Couldn't it have happened some other day? Mother was so fond of this tree. Such a proud tree, she would always say. I can't really imagine Mother being very fond of anything. Thilde! But today of all days... Perhaps it was fate. That the lightning struck now, for Mother's funeral. A stroke of fate. ...uprising in Cuba, shots are fired through the night On the streets of Havana You're shot if you're white - Enough, Lorenz. Bernd? On coal heaps in cellars... - Lorenz, did you hear what I said? Everyone sings it at school. - I don't care, I don't want to hear it. On coal heaps in cellars Negroes with guns, they are a-waiting To shoot at the white folk Who in their pants, they are a-shitting On the roof, the chief is sitting On a toddler, he is nibbling In a big pot, its bones In a soup, they are a-bubbling - Jana, Lorenz, I said that's enough! Why can't you say something? - What do you want me to always say? Always? Just once would be nice. Stop that right now, I said. Enough! I hope it didn't take out the tree house. Lorenz! Be careful, Lorenz! You promised you'd call Dad. It's not my fault if he doesn't pick up. But I want to see him! It's not the end of the world. I can call him again tomorrow. No! - Let's go! Leave that. It really got hit badly. How about buying your own? - The machine wouldn't take my money. You look nice. Not bad for after a funeral, right? - Nice colour. Is it new? - I've had it ages. The first thing I could find in all the rush. And the first shoes you found just happened to match. I have to get going anyway. Gunther's waiting for me. Who's Gunther again? You don't know him, one of my old admirers. They're all old... Jana... It was just one bolt of lightning. One bolt of lightning, one rumble of thunder, and that was it. And today of all days. I didn't mean to bother you, but we didn't know... We couldn't enter the property and... You never know with trees falling, maybe a kid would get hurt. No, it was good you called, Mr Buchner. You've been lucky. This could have all been set ablaze. God forbid. Jana, Inga, go play outside. Away from all this electricity. Dad cut it off, nothing can happen. Jana, be careful not to cut yourself. Just what I needed. Pesky creatures. All these lovely things. Well, you would've had to part with most of them anyway. Why's that? Don't worry. The insurance will cover it all. But most of the things here are Mother's. Your mother had taste, I'll give her that. Can I have a go? - I found it. Dad can repair it all anyway. - I hope so. You think it's still worth it? What do you mean "worth it"? - Things could move fast with the buyer. It's a nice building plot. What buyer? I spoke to my cousin, and he said he wants to take a look at the property next week. Why are you talking to your cousin about our property? Well, your sister-in-law said, now that your mother's gone... There must be a misunderstanding. Oh well... Perhaps I got it wrong. I could've sworn though... ...eight-year-old Nina C. from Munich has disappeared. The girl was last seen yesterday afternoon, on her last day of school. A friend of the girl stated that they went to a nearby playground together after school. From there, the girls parted ways and went to their respective homes. But Nina C. never arrived home. Please contact the police with any clues concerning the girl's whereabouts. It almost feels as if Grandma Sophie could walk in at any moment. Bye, sweetie. - Bye, Mum! You be good. Inga, are you coming? - See you tomorrow. Have a nice evening. You too. Grandad? Grandad? Did it break all your stuff too? - Strangely not. A tripped fuse, but other than that... Hello, Mummy. - Hey, darling. Everything at Ilse's house is destroyed. Grandad's is fine, apart from the fuse. - Yeah? Everything's still in one piece over here. Are they starting already? It's good Mother's not still around to see it. We do not have one death only. The one that takes us away is merely the final one. I have a very bad feeling about this. We're too far away. We're out of harm's way. Where are the children? They were just here. Jana? - Lorenz? Jana. Do you know where Lorenz is? - No idea. Well? - Nope. He wouldn't be so stupid as to... Careful, careful. Stay here. Check the tree house, I'll go... - Come, come. He's not here either. - Let's check the pool. I already spoke to Buchner. Ilse's not going to be happy. But what does Ilse need such a big property for? I'd give you a hand, but my back's been playing up lately. We're almost done anyway. We'll have to wait and see what's in the will. Why? What do you expect it'll say? - Nothing. But still. I don't really care. I don't need the money. It's just Inga, and the new school... - I'll give you a hand. Let's get this one, OK? - Yes. Wait, wait, wait. - It's alright. No, no. That must be Frank, Lorenz. - See you later! Later? We're getting a Flipper at the Co-op. You're not going there on your own. - Why not? We always go on our own. - Not anymore. Did you hear that, kids? You don't go anywhere alone until they find that girl. But there are two of us. You know what I mean. There's a crazy kidnapper on the loose. Hi, Frank. - I want an ice cream! I want, I want, I want. - No more wanting from you today, OK? So mean. I didn't do anything. Let's go. Thanks. You've got money? - Yes. We'll get an ice cream anyway. Close it! - OK. Are you coming? Are you coming? - I'll finish smoking first. Kids? We don't want to frighten him. He's not a squirrel. But we wanted to bring him some wood. - Right. But quietly. You go first. - Yep. Shush now. Maybe he is at home. Mr Flachs? Mr Flachs? He doesn't seem to be in. You two can unload the wood. - Right. I'll write a note. Maybe there's some paper among all this junk. Look! Perfect, we can use one of these. PARENTS WORRIED SICK: WHERE IS OUR NINA? They're all about that girl. - We can tear a corner off. I still need a pen. WHAT MONSTER KIDNAPPED NINA C? I can hear something. I can't. It's gone now. Come on, let's go. Come on. Through the streets, the pus is flowing Traffic's jammed, nowhere it's going On street corners, boys are sitting On the pus, they are a-feasting From the trees, guts are dangling From the heat, they are a-ponging And below, women are hunching On the guts, they are a-munching In the bathtub... Ouch! What's wrong? - I got stung by a wasp. It hurts so much! Where does it hurt, huh? - What hurts? Here. A wasp sting. Oh God. A wasp! Do something, Erich. What can I do? It's dead already. There's nothing much I can do. You know what? We'll get you a Flipper. You like them, don't you? We can do it on your birthday too. Everyone gets a Flipper ice lolly! - What happened? I got stung by a wasp. Oh, that hurts. - Now let's cool it down. Do you know who you want to invite? Grandma and Grandad, Aunt Ilse... And Angie and Silke and my daddy... Yes, of course! He's never been around for her birthday. Perhaps he'll come this time. If someone lumbered you with a child, you wouldn't look after it either. What does "lumbered with a child" mean? Well... Well, it's when someone doesn't really want a child, but they get one anyway. Are there people who don't want kids? - No. There are. Of course. There are people who don't. Didn't Gitti want to have Inga? Gitti did. But Inga's daddy didn't. But shush! This one's ready. Who wants it? I'll take it if it's ready. - Yes, you have the red one. I wanted the blue one. Put that smaller one on here. You want to take the blue one? Are you going to hang one too? - Yeah. Mine won't stay on. I've got another one. - Here's good. Here? - Yep. A bit lower. Like that? - Yep. You got it? - Almost. Hang on. It's logical to hang the traps where there are most wasps. And here's where there are most wasps. But they don't bother us here. I'd put them on the terrace. That's absolute nonsense. We'd just end up attracting more. Right. And this one over here. Out of the way. WASP KILLER TALLY Unbelievable, right here in SÃ¼dpark. Oh God. So close by. Imagine if Poldi had found the body when he was out being walked. I don't want to imagine something like that. Poor thing. What? Where did you leave your teeth? As if killing her wasn't enough. How do you mean? It's ghastly. Let me see. Oh no, I don't want to see that. Actually, let me see. God knows why they have to show that in the paper. Seven. Inga... - Nine. Inga, no... - You were on six. You're too small. - You're just scared. I'm not scared at all. It's too dangerous. - But Jana's only eight. And you're only five. - I'm almost six. So? - Stay out of it. I'll tell my dad, he'll let me. Go tell your dad, he didn't want you anyway. You shut your mouth. I won't. Jana! Let's go swimming. - But I want to go up there. Swimming's much nicer. But when I'm six, I'm allowed. - We'll talk again then. Promise? - Yes. Lorenz, where are you? I've found something. Hello! Hello. Frieda. I'm Gitti's mother. Erich. The father. - We're heading off now then. I'll take Inga to nursery in the morning. I'll pick her up in the afternoon. Bye, Mummy. - Come here, please. Careful, Lorenz. He's driving off. It's very embarrassing. Really. He's never done anything like this before, I don't know what got into him. I perhaps shouldn't have been stroking him like that. It's just on the tram that he sometimes goes a bit loopy. I really feel awful about it. It's not so bad. Really. At least we finally get to talk. I've noticed you many a time. Oh yes? You always get on at Holzapfelstrasse. Yes. I live close to there. Poldi! What are you doing down there? Leave poor Ms Fischer alone. Beat it! He's usually so well-behaved. What if it explodes? What could possibly explode? - You do it then! Why? You say you'd do it. Here, I'll do it. 13. - 15. 26. There's no way you killed 26. You're cheating. - I'm not. Yummy! This is a brilliant hiding place. They'll never find us. They're coming. Poldi, come and sit! We inherited the garden, we can do what we want with it. You heard the notary. "Testamentary restraining order", what does that even mean? Why do they have to be so complicated? Why are you poking your nose in again? It's between Erich, Thilde and me. - I beg your pardon? Erich is my husband! - Yes, and he can speak for himself. Damn pests. That's typical of Sophie, still getting in our way when she's dead. Mother never wanted to get in anyone's way. That you of all people say that... - Why me? I have no idea what you mean. Or why you're getting so worked up. No one wants to sell the property anyway, right? Well... We have considered something along those lines. Erich! You can't be serious. Jana, Inga, what are you doing down there? Having a picnic. But why are you under the table? Because we're dogs, and dogs don't sit on chairs. Get out from there now. You don't do that. Where's your mummy and daddy? Gone shopping. They left you all alone here? Just when that girl disappeared? Attack! Jana, stop that, please. That's Grandma Sophie's armchair. You'll break it if you keep jumping on it like that. Hold this, please. Is this Grandma Sophie? - Yes. I hardly recognise her. Yes, that was before she got so sick. You wouldn't remember that. Right... Is this one Great-grandad? Yes, that's him. And where's your wedding photo? I don't have one. I never got married. Why not? Perhaps because I... never found the right one. And now you're much too old. Much too old. Property prices are going through the roof at the moment. People are buying properties like crazy. There must be something we can do. Can Poldi sleep at ours tonight? - We'll ask Ilse, OK? I'll ask Gunther, he has a great lawyer. Finally we get the land and now we can't sell it... Mummy? When are we going home? Mummy, when are we going? - Soon. They're still here! - Where are they all coming from this year? You must've misheard. - No, I heard exactly what they said. We'll soon find out. But you need to act now, not when it's too late, else Gitti will get everything. Like she always does. Gitti, she's... You have two children and she only has one. Here, you have to do this one again. ...the mutilated body found in Munich's SÃ¼dpark belongs to eight-year-old Nina, who has been missing since 29 July. The girl's hands and feet are still yet to be found. Police have intensified their search for the murderer but without success. Now the weather. The current heatwave continues to grip West Germany... I hope you haven't been waiting long. - No. I just called a few times. What now? It's been going on all morning. Come in. - Thank you. If I'd known... It's nice that there's some action. I always wanted a large family. Do you have children? - No. Unfortunately not. Somehow... it never happened. Oh! Are they new? It's strange how you never remember what was there before. Geraniums, red geraniums. I'm not actually a fan of geraniums. They were my mother's favourite flowers. It must be a difficult time for you. Yes. It's not so bad here. There's always something going on. But at home... I'm often lonely there. Without her. Just be careful here. It really was very pleasant. Good. I thought so too. I'll go first. Nine golds already. Yes, I read it. But the East Germans are still beating us again. Almost makes you want to be united with them again. You need something? - Nails, preferably not rusty ones. How long? What's the longest you've got? If I could just find my spectacles... Here they are. There they are. Right. Can't you have a bit of a clear-out? The war's been over for 30 years. Waste not, want not. Perfect. Thank you. And a completely different matter... Eva overheard something. About the garden. Are you perhaps thinking of selling it? Well... Yeah. - But... I thought you couldn't. It was just... a thought. But... But you'd tell us if something came of it? Of course. Definitely. Right. Frank, I've got something. I don't hear anything. Proceed? Roger. Look! Maybe her hands are buried here. Poke this in. I think I can feel something. Flachs! - Oh God! Thank you. We will look into the matter. I bet Flachs reported us. You think? He's an artist, he's totally harmless. Harmless? I don't want them hassling Flachs because of us. What about Flachs? Were the police here because of him? - No, it was something else. What was it about then? That girl. - Nothing. Did they find her hands? Where were you? I told you not to go out alone. Aunt Thilde brought you cake. - Really? But we ate it. We didn't know if you were coming. You're so mean! It was a joke. First one there gets the biggest slice. Let me see too. - No, I trapped it. But the dead one is mine. Right... It should be working again now. Thank you. I always thought you liked being here as much as I do. It's all purely theoretical at this stage. Theoretical? I can't imagine life without the garden. What would happen to us? If the garden were gone. Can I help you at all? No, there's not much left to do. How beautiful is all first acquaintance. You only live as long as you discover. What do you think about her? Yeah. But that's Father! Yes... I thought... nobody would mind now. Since when have you been wearing lipstick? I... I just am. You really got dolled up, didn't you? How so? You look like a clown. Damn wasps... Oh, I didn't even offer you any cake. There's peach, strawberry roll and... Frankfurt crown cake. That one's from yesterday. I'd like a piece of Frankfurt crown cake. It's delicious. They all look wonderful. And one more. Thank you. - Here. Delicious. Thank you for the lovely afternoon. I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. It really is a special little place you have here. Yes, it is. Right... Yes. Goodbye. - There's something I wanted to give you. Oh. - Yes. He's not in. You got the string? - Yep. Do it a bit tighter. - Yep. That's good. Where shall we put it? There. Where? - Up there. Come in. Jana, can you hear me? I can hear you. Great. Where are your sunglasses? - In my bag there. We're going to stab out all the wasps. OK, stop. That's enough. Where are they? - They must be there somewhere. Here they are. Don't wave it about, OK? I'm not sure it's such a good idea. Yeah, but we can't just leave it up there. Right by the front door. I need some gloves. Inga and Thilde have already been stung. Come on, it's hardly the first wasp nest we got rid of here. There are professionals... The other ones were always smaller. They were always in spring. Why do the damn creatures have to build their nest on Ilse's house? As if there's nowhere else. It's just because of my knee. I'm usually the first to fulfil my duty. Where one loves what one commands oneself to do. I'm not the slightest bit scared. Yeah right! You're always scared. I'm not scared at all. Since when do you need your knees to hold a bin bag? What if we have to flee in a hurry? It's mean. I'm never allowed to do anything. I can hold a torch as well as he can, and I'm not a chicken. I'm not either! Be glad, it's stupid work, and stupid work is for men. Is it dangerous? Yes, a little. Then I don't want you to do it. It's not dangerous, it was just a joke. It'll soon be better. If Grandad hadn't dropped the bag, we'd have had them. Right, Dad? Well, if Grandad hadn't dropped... What am I supposed to do if hundreds of them go for me? Everything was black from all the wasps. They still seem so angry. They don't have a home anymore. But they're free now. They can go wherever they want. I don't think they want to go anywhere, they want to go home. Are you feeling sorry for the damn creatures now? I think there are fewer of them now. Give it half an hour. They'll sleep when it gets dark. I've never seen a wasp in the dark. But that's probably because it was dark. Here. No, wait... - Would you look at that! Next page. - Yeah, wait. "Mieze and Maunz, the cats, they sharply arched their backs, and loudly miaowed: Dad says we're not allowed." Yes! Now I'm going to take out... Jana! That's not fair! I only have two left. - How's it unfair? That's the game. I'll give it a go. - No, Mummy! It's your turn. Perfect camouflage, that spangly top. They'll get confused and forget to sting you. It's Dior. You can't afford it. Nor can you. I don't need to. Gunther gave it to me. I'm sure his wife has the same one. Don't you meddle in our family business. What do you mean "your" family? Mother didn't mean it like that, did you, Mother? Ouch! Now I've been stung! But there aren't any in here. There are. There's loads of them. Did you close the windows? Check the windows! Quickly! - Here's one! Get out! - I'm scared. Get out! They're all closed. Quickly! Out! Jana, Lorenz, get away from there. They're really aggressive. No, there are more outside! How did they get in here? - Through the stove! Oh God, the fireplace! Don't open it! Close it! Out! Everyone get out quickly! Quick, close the door! Wow, there are loads here. Let me see. Check out this fat one. I found another aspirin. Thanks. I'm already feeling a bit better. It's ages since I was last in here. Yep. She always wanted to be left alone in here. You know, perhaps... The next time, if you must go lie in the sun, maybe don't do it in front of the children? I fell asleep. But you know, Mother never liked your nudist thing. Mother is dead. But it's nice you spend more time here now. It really is a little slice of paradise that we have here. Come, come. Up! Jump, jump! - No, stop. Here. Through there. No, no. Here, up there. Ah, now she's seen it. Now she's seen it. Bad news. - ...three, four, out you go! Now I'm annoyed. Look out... Off the board, let's do that again. Three. Oh! One, two, three. If you get a six now, I'm out. Where are the balls? I'll save you! I'm coming in! You can roll again. Come, we'll paint your toenails. - No! You wanted to before. - Not anymore. Now I have all the stuff. Come. - No, leave me alone. Leave me alone! I don't want to get my nails painted. - Leave her. We're almost done. Yeah. I rolled a two but I can't get out. Your turn. They should bring back the death penalty. You can't even say that out loud these days. This wouldn't have happened under Hitler. He would've made short work of it. Did they finally get him? No, but a witness has reported something he saw. He reminds me of someone. But who? Finally a bit cooler. It was unbearable today. Maiden name of Swedish Queen Silvia? You don't know that? They only just got married. It was a wonderful fairytale marriage. They met here at the Olympics. Ten letters, second letter is "o". Sommerlath. Silvia Sommerlath. With a "th". I told Gitti at the time that she should take some time off, and apply to work there as hostess. Put your crossword down for a second. We wanted to speak to you about the... about the garden. Buchner has this cousin. He might be interested in our property. You understand? He might want to buy it. But he can't. That's what I want to talk about. There are certain tricks. Like... It's too complicated, I can't really explain it. But the lawyer says it's possible. Fashionable dance in the 50s. Five letters. Mambo? Why don't you use the bigger one? It'll be faster. Don't frighten me like that. I didn't hear you coming. Shall I go fetch the big one? - No, I'm almost done. It's not been the same here since Sophie died. How so? She hardly came towards the end anyway. But still, something's different. You think? Don't you miss her at all? Miss her... I wouldn't really say she was the kind of person you would miss. Why? She was always nice to me and the kids. You should've seen what she was like before. At least then there'd be no issue with the garden. I always thought you didn't even like the garden. Depends what you mean by "like". It's not about that. We won't see any of the money anyway, but then the kids would at least benefit from it. And what else would we do on weekends and during holidays? What did we do before we had kids? We must've done something. Wonderful! Come here! What do you think you're doing? I said no walking along there without a proper railing. Why don't you say anything? - It's not that high. Yeah, it's not that high. It's at least two stories high. No more walking across there without the railing! Understood? Come on, kids. Inga! Are you coming? We have to get going. Here. Jana and I made this for you. Oh, that's pretty. - It has your name on it too. May I open another one? - You can open the one from Gunther. He brought it all the way back from America. Watch out. That's a big one. What is it? - It's a slide that goes on the floor. Let me see. - It's the latest craze in America. I want one for my birthday! - You can try it when the others arrive. When Daddy gets here? Yes, when Daddy gets here. Let's just try it out now. Come on. On ponds, corpses are a-floating Their bellies are a-bloating Cannibals' knives are a-poking... Daddy, can we set this up? Here, I'll do it. Hello, I'm Jana. Do you think this is enough for so many people? There won't be that many. Most of the nursery kids have cancelled. I was too late asking. The Schauers want to come with Silke. I hope they do anyway. "To my darling Inga, from Great-aunt Thilde." And that one? This one's from your mum. "My dear Inga, happy birthday from Mummy." And which one's from Daddy? I don't think there is one. Unwrap one from Grandma and Grandad. I bet there's something nice inside. Where shall I put this? Here. It's handy having this garden, isn't it? - Yes, but it's a lot of work. Where would we celebrate Inga's birthday otherwise? Don't run through the flowers! - These are for decoration, I'll get more. Very pretty. Thank you. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Inga Happy birthday to you Now me? - Yeah! No, I'm too old. Choo choo, Grandad's coming through! Out of the way, I'm coming! Try it, it's really good fun. I'm glad it all worked out. - Yeah. And... really fast! No more, you two. It's just for the little ones. Why? You just did it a second ago. What little ones anyway? - Silke and Inga. We can slide too! - No. Why not? - Because I said so. It's our garden too, you can't tell us. But it's our slide. What a crappy party. Watch out! That was a good one! When's Daddy coming? I want to show him the slide. I'm not sure he's coming. Maybe something came up. But you promised. - I didn't. I just said he might come. No, you said he would definitely come and that he'd bring me a present. You know what? I'll call him and ask if he's coming, OK? I don't want it. - Don't be like that, Inga. But it's from you. No, it's from Inga's dad. He sent it in the post. It said something different before. - Shut your lying trap. Shall we unwrap all the presents then? You said there was no present from Daddy. He wanted to give it to you himself. Liar! Who wants cake? - Inga! Leave me alone! Hey, we made a deal that you can go up the tree house for your birthday. No, you can't. It's my tree house and I decide who comes up. But it's our garden and you don't decide anything. It's our garden too! Hey, are you crazy? Stop it! Stop that, you little shitheads! Quick! You grubby little... Close it, quick! Open the door now! Open the door now! Lorenz and Gitti won't stop fighting. Really? - Yeah. Come on now, Lorenz. They just want to come up quickly, then you can have your peace. See, you can't talk to him. - Leave it. Aunt Gitti called us shitheads. - I did not. I'm sure she didn't mean it. - She did. Leave Lorenz alone. You stay out of it. You can stay out of it. - I will not. It's between me and Lorenz. So you got Bernd and Erich to help out? They're twelve, you should be ashamed. Lorenz started it. - I'm just mediating. Lorenz can't ban me from the tree house. It's his tree house. He decides who goes up there. It's our garden. No one tells me what I can and can't do. Be happy you're allowed the tree house. - Excuse me? You and your fucking brats. You've got no say here. You're not even part of the family. Thank God! I don't want to be part of this family. Everyone calm down, what's wrong? I won't calm down. You calm down. Oh right, you don't need to. You never get worked up about anything. Come, Jana. Gitti, come here. Eva. - Unbelievable... Open up! This is ridiculous. Eva! Thanks again. - My pleasure. And we'd love it if Silke came to play again next week. Yes, we'll be in touch. - Great. Say bye to Inga. - Bye, Inga! Have a nice birthday, Inga. Bye! Oh, hello. - Good evening. Mr Buchner! - I saw the party was still going. Did you hear? - Hear what? About the cannibal. - What cannibal? The one they caught this morning. Not another ghastly story! I don't want to hear. It really is ghastly. I heard it on the radio. Then I had to go out and get tomorrow's paper. First the poor girl and now this. Is it never going to end? - It will now that they've got him. Oh, is it the same person, the cannibal and the girl one? It sure is. So her hands and feet, he... That's right. He fed on them. He ate them! Who ate what? He ate the cake. The cake. It looks delicious. If you have a slice going spare... Why, of course. - I don't mean to impose... but I wouldn't say no to a piece of cake. They've caught the girl's murderer. Oh yes? - And it wasn't Flachs. I shouldn't really be eating at this time. Because of my cholesterol. It seems it was a cannibal. What's a cannibal? - Do you have to say it in front of Jana? That's enough now. - That's mean. Where have you been? We were looking for you. I went to the toilet. - Yeah, right. You promised we're allowed to stay up late tonight. It's already much later than usual. You have to tell us a story at least. - I don't have to do anything. Please! OK then. What kind of story? A scary one! - About the cannibal! A scary one? What can I say...? I don't know much about it. Did they really get the right man? Yeah, I'm pretty sure they did. How do they know they did? Because they found one of the girl's hands. At the man's house. In a soup pot. Why was it in a soup pot? Because he was cooking it in there. - But cannibals only eat raw meat. Yeah? I didn't know that. He was probably a picky eater. And are there others like him in the world? Yeah... I guess there's a few of them. Come on now, off to bed! Move it! Trousers off. Shall I leave the light on? Hurry! It's about to get nasty. - Yes. Thank you, it was lovely. - My pleasure. We got lucky with the weather. - Yes. We could sleep in the little house tonight. Leave the kids sleeping. It's been a while. Is there enough space? It might be a bit of a squeeze. But that makes it all the more cosy. That would be nice. Do you want a drop? - Yes, please. I thought I heard something. Hello. Hello. Watch out. Such a lovely tree house. You put so much work into it and now... And your sister, how is...? Such a nice girl. And then this... I won't disturb you any longer. Just wanted to see if you needed anything. OK then... Goodbye.
