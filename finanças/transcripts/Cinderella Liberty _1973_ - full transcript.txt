Baggs? - I don't have any Baggs here. - You sure? I should be there. I'm in transit here, waiting for a ship. I don't have your name on the list here. I can't pay you. - What am I sup— - Move on. - Wait a minute. What am I supposed to do? - Move on! 110. Oh! - Well? - Well, they're bound to show up. They've just been misplaced, I'm sure. What do you mean “misplaced,” you're sure? - I mean, you gotta find 'em. - I beg your pardon, sailor. Without records, I can't get paid. Sir. I can't get paid, sir. Well, you're on ice for a while, Baggs. No pay and no orders until we find your records. - Until you find them. - I said we'll find them! If not, we'll just reconstruct them from the microfilm files in Washington. That'd take weeks, months. I mean, what am I supposed to use for money, sir? Try Navy relief. This seat taken? Want a beer? Always. One more. I, uh, hear you took Doug to the movies. Yeah. It's funny what some folks will do. Ooh. Getting down to the bottom of the well there, Johnny. Yeah. They lost my pay record. Oh, I'm sorry. Maggie! Maggie. - Oh, go screw. - Ready whenever you are. I wouldn't want to make your hand jealous. Hey, sweet thing. You're puttin' on a couple of pounds. - What'd you do, swallow a pumpkin seed? - Look, hey, peckerhead. This is my barstool, my beer and my broad. - So beat it. - Okay. - Now. - Okay. No offense. My goodness. 1 sighs 1 1 sighs 1 You sure are some fast worker. Already we're kissing on the mouth. Hmm. Can I ask you a personal question? Sure. What's your religion? - My religion? - Mm-hmm. Why? I wanna know. Eh, I guess, uh”. I'm a ba— basement baptist. Basement baptist. - A what? - Basement baptist. What? See, my— my, uh... My daddy, he was a janitor in a church. On Sundays... I'd, um... Help him keep the furnace going. Yeah. He was a good old guy. Played the mandolin. Hmm. He's religious, ain't he? Was, yeah. He died when I was 12. And, uh... When I was 16, my, uh, ma remarried. You should have seen this jerk she married. What a jerk. Slept with his socks on. And, uh, when I was old enough, I enlisted. Listen, what I want to know is... Do you have a lot of rules you have to follow? Don't do this, don't do that. Stuff like that? Well, a few homemaders is all, I guess. Yeah? Like what? Well... I don't— I don't use, uh, bad language, for one thing. What else? - What else? - Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] Well, um, I don't like iyin'. - Why not? - Why not? It just ain't right, that's all. It's not right. Do you realize where I'd be if I never told a lie? [ Clicks tongue ] Christ, Baggs. - Watch your mouth, now. - You see? See? Won't be able to open my mouth up around you. What else, Saint John? Hmm? I'll bet there's a kicker. What else? Well, I won't— I won't ever hit you. Uh-uh. That's for sure. - You won't, huh? - No, ma'am. No way. Sure, daddy. - What's that? - Souvenir. [ Sobs ] Don't jump in over your head, daddy. Mm-mmm. Cut it out. You sound like a whore. I, um... I like you. But, um, we ain't in a position for a steady thing. I, uh— I got some worries... And it's gonna be harder for me later on. Well, whatever comes up, I'll handle it. I think you better go. If you say so. I'll see you tomorrow. I might not be by tomorrow. Okay. I'll see you when you do come by. I'll be by tomorrow. I might not be here. I'll see you when you are. I'll be here. Who wants to waste time with this crap? I know what I think he wants to see. Why don't you meet me in the cafeteria in about 10 minutes? Come on. I'll show you something. Right here, okay? How 'bout this, huh? That's radar. Keen, huh? Look at all this here. See, that's a tachometer— revolutions per minute. That's the rudder. That's the engine tiller drive. Yeah. The compass. - Wow! - The wheel. - [ Imitating engine ] - How 'bout that? You can hardly hear in here! I'm sure glad you aren't hungry. What are you doing? Get your sleeve out of that. Gosh darn. - Can't take him anywhere. - Anywhere but out. - I'm goin'. - Where you goin'? To meet Sam. What's it to you? Well, just make sure you're home early. I'll tell you one thing— Sure knows what to do with a tray of food. [Laughs] When he was two years old... I used to take him to this place on rampart street. They used to have a Wednesday night special. All the shrimp you could eat for a buck, 95. Two years old. Boy, could he put away shrimp. Just try and see how many shrimp you can get here for a buck, 95. Yeah, well, it's always better where you been than where you are. The thing is, it really is better in New Orleans. Hell, a phone call only costs a nickel. I don't care. I got no one I care to talk to except you. We used to have a wrought iron gate in front of our place. You needed a special key to get in. - [ Chuckles ] - Yeah? Would you hand me that wrench over there? Oh. Here. No, no, no. It's that, uh, chrome-looking thing. It's got a little, uh... That a girl. You see, the thing is... At night you don't so much hear the music as you feel it. You could place your hand on a window and get the music right through your fingertips. - It's awful nice, Johnny. - Yeah? Well, maybe I'll buy a car or somethin'. - Oh! - [ Knocking ] - Who's that? - I don't know. I'll get it. - [Whispers ] Hide! - What? - Under the bed. Hide. - Why? It's my goddamn social worker. Watch your mouth. I didn't even know you had a social worker. Uh, miss Watkins, what a pleasant surprise. Uh, my brother from New Orleans. How do you do? I'm not really her brother. This is a hell of a way to waste your time. - Can't we find miss Watkins a date, Johnny? - Well... I don't enjoy this sort of thing, nor do the taxpayers enjoy paying for welfare. Where is Douglas? - He's all right. Tell her. Isn't he all right? - He's all right. There is wine in this refrigerator. There's no milk in this refrigerator. Look, Doug hates milk. The wine is his. He brought it with him. I hope you haven't been misusing your food stamps. Would you like me to tell you where you could paste your food stamps? - I don't think she— - I'll tell her! The razor is mine. I have to shave my legs, don't I? [ Miss Watkins ] Do you also have to splash aqua velva on them? [ Maggie ] What if I do? What the hell if I do? Uh, are you assuming the role? - Ma'am? - Are you assuming the role of spouse? - Uh, I don't quite get that. - He's a boy I know. For cryin' out loud, don't I have the right to know a boy? How much are you contributing to the support of this family? Oh. Uh, I see. They lost my records. I don't have a dime. - Does she give you money? - You don't have to answer her. Are you the father of her child? [John ] Ma'am? Are you the father of her child? Well, do I look like the father of her child? I mean, the one she's carrying now. Thanks a lot, miss Watkins. You're a friggin' peach. You're gonna have another baby? It was before I met you, Johnny. How could I know that you'd come along? How could I know that? What color is this one gonna be? Purple. Okay? I tried to tell you. Well, what's the rush? Why didn't you wait till the little bastard was born? I'm glad you ain't the father. You call a person names before he's even a person! All right, how long have you been living here assuming the role of spouse? Lady, I'm a sailor in transit, which is the only role I give a royal shit about. - Say good-bye to Doug for me. - Bastard! You're the real bastard! You! I didn't tell you because I knew that you'd act like this! You don't care about me and you don't care about my kid! All you care about is getting laid for free! You're nothing but a lousy sailor... And I hate you! - [ Door closes ] - [ Sobbing ] I hate all sailors. [ Man #1 ] You got a lot of women on the eastern seaboard. [ Man #2 ] Yeah. [ Man #1 ] You got Maine, you got New Hampshire... You got, uh, Vermont... You got, uh— [ Exhales] Connecticut... You got New Jersey. Which brings us to where I lived. I used to live in Atlantic city. We used to go underneath the boardwalk and hide... So we could look under the girls' skirts. Yeah? You ever catch any without their panties? [ Dice rattle, land on board ] Beautiful. Yeah. Figures, doesn't it? - That'll be $3,200. - $3,200. - Yes. - $3,200? I'm unbeatable at this game. It's because I'm from Atlantic city. I ain't got it. Cleans me out. Baggs, you got the Midas touch in reverse. - There are people like that. - What do you mean? Well, nothin' personal, but everything you touch turns to shit. See? [ Exhales ] You'll never get anywhere in the business world being so sensitive. [ Forshay] Don't be shy, my boy! You'll see things you've never seen before in your whole life! Come on in, boys. The show starts in five minutes! J“j“ [ Jazz] See this sea of feminine pulchritude direct from Paris, France. Step right up, boys. Come on. We're about to start this show. She's topless! She's bottomless! She's reckless! No fooling no cover charge, no minimum! Come on in, boys! You never seen anything like this! She's a beaut! Hey, Mike! Let these two in on a special deal! That's it. Go on up, boys. You'll have a great time. Forshay. Baggs. Hello, Baggs! How do you like this outfit, Baggs? You can't keep a good man down. Hmm? - J“j“ [ Continues ] - Come on, let's go back into my office. We'll chew the rat for a bit, huh? [ Shouts ] Show time! Show time! [ Chuckling ] Give it to 'em. You don't look so good, Baggs. Here, sit. Look at you. I'm not doin' so bad. [ Chuckles ] [All laughing ] Can you believe it? Hey. Hey! [Shouting, laughing ] - [ Screams ] - Go home! How'd you like to take a runnin' jump at that, Baggs, huh? Hey, knucklehead, what are you doing back here? - Your place is up there. Savvy? - Yes, sir. - Get going! Hurry up! Chop-chop! - Yes, sir. Right away. - Who's this jerk? - He's a friend of mine. Well, friend or no friend, take him up there and make him pay! - Right away, sir. - [ Muttering ] Up your ying-Yang, slanty. He works me like a goddamn coolie. Watch your mouth, please. [ Mutters] [ Cat yowls ] You look lousy, Baggs. What's the matter with you? Well, I guess nothing's as easy as it used to be. Well, this ain't exactly like standing tall in the service of your country. Here, let me show you something. This was... This when I was 17 beautiful years old. You were a good-looking kid. You ever been in love, Forshay? I tell you, Baggs, I don't believe I have. That's because I happen to be one of those incurable romantics. Every time I meet a girl, I expect to hear a clap of thunder. I never heard the thunder, but occasionally I did get the clap. - J“j“ [ Continues ] - Show time! Show time here! Step right up and see Angela poontang! There you are, everybody. Quickly, inside. Show starts in five minutes. Hear that? That's it. Go up. You'll enjoy yourself. Step right up and see Laura and... [ Engine off] - Hey, I'm gonna talk to this kid for a minute. - Sure. What's wrong? Nothin'. Not exactly. What's that mean? They cut off our welfare money. Well, why? They said there was a man assumin' the role of spouse. You. [ Exhales] It ain't good for the baby if she drinks. I suppose it ain't. She don't do as good when you're not there. Neither do I. Then lighten up, man. It happened before she met you. Besides, I can't hack it by myself. I'm only 11. Remember? Don't tell her I was by. I won't. [ Brakes hissing ] [ Bus pulling away] [ Knocking ] Hi, kid. Huh? What? She's sick. - What's the matter? - Booze. [ Groans ] Johnny? - [ Sighs] - You're a mess. Oh, just... my stomach. [ Groans ] I'll be right back. [ Groans ] - You have some tomato juice? - We got v-8 juice. - Open that for me, will ya, chief? - Open it yourself. Uh, lemon. You got lemon? - Vinegar. - Vinegar. Why not? Now, we need a little roughage here. Don't have to be fresh... Which I'm sure this is not. - A pinch of that here. - What you tryin' to do, kill her? Oughta do it. Mmm. Ohh. Delicious. Who made this? - He did. - He did. [ Laughs ] Well, what I don't drink I can use to kill roaches. Well... At least you look somewhat alive now. I'll bet you say that to all the girls. I gotta meet a friend. [ Door opens, closes ] [ Exhales] Sure like that kid. Yeah. He's moody as hell. Why's that? Just his way. Who's his daddy? A fella I knew in New Orleans. Married to him? How come? He had a rotten personality. Well— [ Clears throat] How about mine? [Laughs] What are we playin', 20 questions? No, I'm just trying to get you to say something nice for once. I'm glad you're back. But it ain't gonna work. It will. It ain't possible. Now, see, there are a lot of people... That will tell you what's possible and what ain't. A lot. Especially if you're a woman. You just—just don't listen to 'em. I don't. You should just listen to me. Why should I? Well... Why don't you just try it? 1 sighs 1 I can hear the sea. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo! What do you wanna name the kid? - Eldridge. - Eldridge? Yeah. He wants to name the baby after eldridge cleaver. Just cut it out. I haven't decided yet. - Why'd you name Doug Doug? - You ain't gonna believe it. Yeah, I will. - I named him after Douglas MacArthur. - What? [ Laughing ] Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Why don't you name the baby? - Me? - Yeah. You're my old man, ain't ya? Stokely. How 'bout we name the kid Stokely? Stokely. Lead with your hands. [ Chattering, indistinct] Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! [Chattering, shouting ] [ Cheering, chattering ] Dig into me. Dig into me. Come on, stick me! [ Grunting ] All right! Bam! Whoo-hoo! Come on! Pump that leg! Pump, pump, pump, pump! - Yeah! - Attaboy! [ Sizzling ] Uh, no more for me. Thank you. No, it was— it was good. What do you think about me going back to the bars and picking up some dough? - Nothin' doin'. - Well, som... Um, Dougie, could I have some hot coffee, please? Some fellas go for pregnant... I don't wanna hear it. If you wanna work, that's fine with me. Get yourself a nice job in Woolworth's or something. Well, they don't take pregnant chicks neither. Yeah, well... How do you know if you never try? [ Chuckles ] Who asked you? [ Sighs ] See, I been, uh, rackin' my brain here. I know you have. Don't worry. Somethin' will shake loose soon. Well, see, I, uh... I been tiptoein' around a possible solution. Well, let's not have secrets. What is it? Well, I thought, uh, we could get married. [ Sighs ] Now I've heard everything. The advantage to, uh, um— [ Clears throat] Excuse me— That particular plan is that, uh... You and Doug could, uh, receive Navy benefits. See? Uh, Navy benefits? They'd pick up the whole tab for the baby and everything. Now, I want you to know, uh— [ Clears throat] That, uh... I mean, I don't hold this thing so sacred. I want you to know that. I mean, some fine-lookin' girl come by... That's somethin' I've never seen before, and, “whang”— I'm ready. See, this is somethin' that you should know, Doug. This is somethin' that you're gonna find out eventually, by yourself. What I mean is that, uh... - You know, about men and, uh— - I already know. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. I know. - [ Clears throat] - [ Laughing ] Well, the thing of it is, you know, the... [Sighs] The baby would be legitimate. That's right. We could name it John Jr. I sure would like that. That's no good. I'm John Jr. It'd have to be John Baggs the third. - Third. - Third? - Yes, ma'am. - That's even better. Somebody named John Baggs the third is gonna have a steady job. At the first sign of a hassle... I mean, the very first sign... I would, uh, wanna feel free t-to go elsewhere. I mean, if it can't be like that, well, then there's just no sense in discussing it. I mean, no sense in discussing it at all. I sure never thought it would come to this. See, and as soon as I, uh— I could get you an ID. Card... Well, then, we could have Doug's, uh, teeth fixed. That would be the first benefit we'd use... Get Doug's teeth fixed. Did you hear that, Doug? Huh? You know what else? I wanna go shopping at the p.X. - [ Laughs] - That's all right. I wanna walk in, show 'em my card and buy things. - That's fine. - [ Giggles ] You know what I wanna buy? You're gonna laugh. No, I won't. I won't laugh. I wanna buy dusting powder for when you get out of the tub. Dust... Well, it makes you feel better... If you're dry and you smell nice. - That's fine. - [ Giggling ] - Dusting powder. - [ Giggling continues] - Oh. - Losers. Both of you. - That is the most asshole thing I've ever heard! - Sorry, sir. Jesus, Baggs. You know, you sound like a bright... You sound like a bright young man. - Did you graduate from high school? - Yes, sir, I sure did. Well, then maybe you can tell me... Why does a bright boy like you... A high school graduate... Go out and marry a barroom whore? Sir, I must respectfully... - You must respectfully shit. - Yes, sir. What are you gonna tell me now? She's not a barroom whore? - No, sir, she's not a b— - Aw, Christ! They should make a study. They should make a study about why so many of our bright boys... Wind up with these champagne cocktail-sipping... Cock-teasing, downtown barroom whores. [Sighs] She— she's gonna have a baby, sir. Yours? [Whispers ] Um, no, sir. - Hmm? - [Clears throat] Excuse me. Uh, no, sir. Well, my god, man, what... You see, sir, all I really want is a... A-An ID. Card for her and the boy... So they can get dependent benefits. See, the boy has a mouthful of rotten teeth, sir... Baggs, you are not officially married, not in the eyes of the Navy. Well, sir, in the eyes of the state of Washington and the rest of the world, I sure am. You may think you're in the state of Washington. What you're in is the Navy. You are not married, nor can you get married, unless you put in a chit. Well, sir, I'll put in a chit. You have no records. You mean, I can't put in a chit unless I... That's right. Well, how— well... Baggs, you simply are not married. Well, sir, my, uh— my wife's gonna be real sorry to hear that. [ Sobbing ] Don't cry, Maggie. Come on. Finally marry me a sailor, and I don't get nothin'. - Nmmw! - Shh, shh. Why is it everybody else gets chicken and I always get the feathers? - [ Sobbing continues] - That son of a bitch. What? Would you describe yourself as a, um... “Champagne cocktail-sippin'... Cock-teasin', downtown barroom whore”? Second-generation. Well, I don't know how yet, but all I can tell you is... The third ain't gonna be anything like the first two were. I'll tell you that. I sure hope not. - Oh, miss Watkins. - Yes? Uh, I guess you don't remember me. Oh, yes. You're the man assuming the role of Maggie Paul's spouse. No, ma'am. I'm not assuming anything. 1 sighs 1 this is an unusual case. Can we get the aid? Just for a little while, till they come up with my records. Well, I'll reopen Maggie's file. I'll have to verify your marriage license and make up a new budget. - Okay. - Sign here. I'll have to check with the Navy regarding your financial status. I'll have to verify that you're getting no money from them. This'll take a few weeks. That's all right. I'm used to waitin'. - Can I ask you something off the record? - Sure. Why did you... What made you take responsibility for them? Well, it, uh... It makes me feel good. I mean, it, uh... Makes me feel terrible, but, uh, it makes me feel good. Hey, partner. Excuse me. You got the right time, please? - Yeah. It's 9:15. - Thank you. Hey, get oof that thing. Get off! - Here I am. What do you want? - I'll tell you what I want. Come here. Boy, that's dumb. Listen, we're gonna walk through this place, and I want you to behave yourself. Just act natural. Do you hear me? That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen. I mean, that's really dumb. - Saved 15 cents. - Save you a smack in the butt. What's the matter with you? You crazy? - Hey, how you doin'? - Fine. - Why you always got to come on like a faggot? - Just keep quiet. And look like you belong to me. Come on. Get in there. It's a mess, all right. You're looking in the mouth of poverty, doc. I guarantee you. Don't you ever brush, kid? [ Mumbling ] - What? - He says he bleeds when he brushes. - No wonder. - I didn't know that, Dougie. - Shh. - What? - Quiet! - What? If they catch us in here, we're gonna be a couple of sorry sailors. - Look, I locked the door. - The old man's got a key. [John ] Doc, please. Come on. You're wastin' time. I'm not a dentist. I'm just a corpsman. Oh, come on, now, doc. I know you been watching dentists work for— how long you been in? - Three years? - Hitches. Three hitches. Just this little bit of work that I've seen you do here, on this boy here... It's incredible to me, your hands and everything. I mean... I know that you know everything there is to know about fixing teeth. Maybe so, but this is some set. Yeah. Boy won't even smile, doc. I'll do what I can. God bless you. Really, doc. Well... Don't expect no miracles. Oop. Well... Here goes nothin'. 1 sighs 1 you're earnin' your seat in heaven today. Yes, you are. Okay, kid, rinse. That's it. Hey, listen, I— I, uh— I watched everything you did. No kiddin', I mean, that's just brilliant, brilliant work. You ain't a dentist, you're an artist. That's what I think. Well, there's still a whole hell of a lot to do. A few could be pulled, a few could be saved with gold crowns. - Terrific. We'll come back tomorrow night. - Huh? No! Wait a second. He can't come back tomorrow night. You don't understand. I can't handle serious stuff like that. Find a book, study up. You'll do fine. Really. Yeah— no! You don't understand! It's root canal! It's all kind of intricate stuff! How you feel? Still numb. You didn't cry one time. Nothin' can make me cry. Yeah, yeah. After another couple visits, you'll be smilin' like Sidney Poitier. Maggie? Maggie, come on out here. I got a little surprise package for you. Come on. This is fuckin' ridiculous. Hey, now, you're gonna have to watch your mouth. You know what I mean? Enough's enough. And I mean it. - Maggie? - I feel stupid. Mag? What's the matter? Don't you feel so good? [ Moans] I just feel a little creepy. Well, I've got somethin' to make you feel a little better. A little surprise. - What? - I'll show you. - What is it? - Well, can you wait a minute? - [ Giggling ] - Look at that. - This is the surprise? - Now, wait a minute. - Ladies and gents of the jury— - I feel like a moron. Well, wait now. Exhibit “a”! How about that? - [Giggles] So? - Well, show her. Go on. Oh, my. Oh, my. - Oh— - [ Liquid trickling ] Oh! Oh, my! Ohh! - Ohh! Ohh! - What is it? - My— my water is breaking! - It's only seven months, though. - Well, I know! - Can't have a baby after seven months. - He's right! - I know he's right. Oh. [Groans] [ Doug ] What's happening? What do you want me to do? What do you want him to do? - Get my stuff ready! - Get her stuff ready. - Oh, and you'd better call the hospital too! - Call the hospital, Doug! [ Doug ] Yeah. [ Exhales] Um, w-w-w-what do we do? [Laughs] We cutout hot baths and sex. Oh, Johnny. You have a way about you. I think I'd better examine you, dear. [ Clears throat] - Raise your legs for me, dear. - Certainly. [ Groans ] Yes, I think we're gonna have company. About eight and a half centimeters dilated. We can move you to the delivery room now. - Well, won't be long now. - [ Chuckles ] - Oh. Oh, uh, could he come with me? - What? Don't you want to watch your child being born? - They don't allow that, do they? - Sometimes. I can check with the doctor. - Okay. I didn't know they allowed that. [ Breathing deliberately] - M-Maybe they don't allow it. - [ Giggles ] [ Groans ] He's willing if you are. Ohh. I'm willing if he is. Well, uh, s-sure. Sure. I, uh... - Shall we move her? - I didn't know they allowed that. [ Rapid breathing ] [ Doctor] Raise your hips now. [ Maggie groaning ] It's coming. It's coming! [ Panting, trembling ] [ Groans ] Well, what the well-dressed dude will wear. [ Panting continues] If you feel faint, just leave. If I order you out, I want you to get out quietly and quickly. - Otherwise, enjoy yourself. - Yes, sir. - Can you see? - Mm-hmm. Yes, sir. Oh, god! - [ Panting continues] - That's a girl. Good girl. Push! - Bear down. - [ Maggie] Okay. All right, now once again. - Here we go. - [ Nurse] Push! - [ Doctor] Good. Good. - That's a girl. - Beautiful. - [ Doctor] All right. [ Exhaling ] Get down there a little more. [ Nurse] Hold your breath. Push. - That's a girl. That's a girl. - Work with— that's good. [ Doctor] Harder. - Harder. - [ Nurse ] That's good. Oh, god. [ Panting, exhaling ] [ Doctor] Come on. Once again. Here we go. Help me. Okay. Okay. - [ Doctor] There we go. - [ Nurse] Push! [ Grunting ] [ Gasps, panting ] - I crying I - it's a boy. [ Laughing ] A boy! A boy! - [Crying continues] - A boy. Get all that stuff. - Susan, hold on to that. - [ Chattering, indistinct] [Crying continues] Oh, a boy. A sweet baby boy. Ohh. [Sighs, laughs] I'm starving. [ Laughs] What's the matter? I'm just, uh... What? Put this silly mask on backwards or somethin'. Just remember, if somebody stops us, you're 13. You got that? Thirteen? What color is he? You won't believe this. He come out, he was blue, pink, black, white, what-all. Course he won't stay like that. When they give him a bath, he'll just turn into his natural color. - Which is? - Same as us. Come on. [ Woman on pa. ] Dr. Marsden, 5-7-5. He's a honky, ain't he? Yeah, I'm afraid he is. Shit. I guess it ain't his fault. Hey. How's the new mama? [Whispers ] Oh, fine. [ Gasps ] Here, uh, that can go there. He's awful small, Johnny. He'll grow. We ain't gonna be able to take him home with us. They said not for maybe a week or so. I think he's all sickly. - Ah— - I should've took better care of myself. Hey, Maggie, it's— It's not your fault. I mean, uh, it's all right. [ Giggles ] - You know what happened early this morning? - Hmm? The weirdest thing. I went down to see him, and I must have been dreamin'... 'Cause I thought he looked at me and said, “could I have my old room back now?” - His old room back? - Yeah. [Giggling ] Having a baby does funny things to you. Twenty-four hours ago he didn't exist... And then, uh, I'd throw myself under a train for him now. He ain't even yours. Oh, it don't matter. He is, though, 'cause you said he was. That's right. Oh, everything's gonna work out now. Babies bring good luck. Yeah, well, we're due. Mm-hmm. What? I, uh... I love you, Maggie. I swear to god I do. [Whispers ] I love you. I love you too. [ Chuckles ] Don't seem fair, coming to a hospital to have a baby... And going home empty-handed. Well, it still won't be long. Only five or six days. Good-bye, John the third. Bye-bye. - Oh, we'll come visit tomorrow? - Oh, you bet. It'll be all right. Give us a chance to get ready for him. So long, kid. [Man on pa. I Dr. Ewing and Dr. Fremont, call Westley immediately. Dr. Ewing and Dr. Fremont... There you go. Give me five, Baggs. It's a little something I picked up for the baby. - Come on! - You tell him it's from uncle Forshay. That right? Here. - Hey. - [Laughs] Hey, that's really nice of you. No kiddin'. That is somethin'. - I made him a boatswain, just like us. - That's really sweet. I tell ya, he's a— he's a hell of a kid. A hell of a kid. Little on the small side, but he's a hell of a kid. Sons, Baggs. You gotta have sons. Or what the hell have you got? Well... You could have daughters. Nothin' wrong with that. You gotta have somethin', goddamn it. Watch your mouth, please. I'm sorry. Well, I got him. I got a son. [ Maggie screams] - It was the hospital. - [ Sobbing ] Come on. Come on, honey. I'm going with you. [ Door slams ] [ Doctor] Maggie, don't blame yourself. [ Maggie] Oh, Johnny. [ Doctor] I'm sorry, son. I'm terribly sorry. Maybe you'd better rest a minute. [ Groans ] Look out, son. - Leave her alone! Leave her— - Hey! All right. Hold him. Hold him. - Are you all right? - Mmm. Are you all right, son? Yeah, I'm fine. - Okay. All right, let him go. - I'm fine. - Come on. - All right, all right. [ Rain falling ] I'm glad he's out of it. If you have to die anyway... You're better off doing it in the first week. You're better off never even being born. 1 sighs 1 shut up, Maggie, please, will ya. I oughta give Doug up for adoption. Stop talkin' crazy. He needs a home. He has a home. - [ Sighs] - I'm sick... Of the whole thing. I'm so... Tired. [John ] Maggie? Now, take that stuff off and stay to home, Maggie. Please? I gotta get out of here, or I'm a dead one, for sure. Wait a minute.

You ever see that before? Fourteen hundred? - What, you goin' somewhere? - You tell me. Maggie? “Dear johnny—” [ Clears throat] “Doug is yours. I'm on my way to New Orleans. Once I get there everything will be fine, and I h... Hope that everything will be fine with you all too. The boy I'm goin'—” “The, uh, boy I'm goin' with said I... I shouldn't bother with this note... But I told him, 'well, I certainly am goin' to bother.' Doug'll understand. He'll be better off with you anyway. Love, Maggie.” She always did wanna go to New Orleans. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I got my orders, and we gotta ship. Goin' overseas tomorrow morning at 8:00. Think I'll head for California. Hitch a ride, maybe jump a freight. I guess I, uh, oughta talk to miss Watkins. Gotta turn you over to somebody. Don't try it. You'll get this between your ribs. Look, Doug, I mean, somebody can adopt you now. These guys that adopt kids, they got a lot of money. I mean, plenty of money. You'd have a... You'd have your own house and real parents... Not just some sailor like me who's always off somewhere. It's my life. That's what I like. Have your own room and, uh, maybe your own bed. Be able to go to camp in the summertime. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? - [ Sniffies ] - Huh? Come here. Come on. - Shit. - [ Sniffiing, sobbing ] Shit. [ Ship's horn blows ] Hey, listen up.
