Think it's upstairs? I can't find it. - It's downstairs. - Are you sure? You never know the way. I said, it's left. You're so annoying! Is it that way? - Upstairs! - Downstairs! I'm going home. A FRIENDLY TALE L?a... L?a! A customer. - What were you doing? - Uh, eating lunch. - Why do you always eat there? - I don't know. Not bad, is it? Don't you like it? I kinda like it. - Can I be honest? - Sure. You're invisible in it. It's a problem if I'm invisible. - It's no time for you to be invisible. - No, it's not. How do you know? You often go past. You held your head high. Recently, you've looked down. That's true. I've been having trouble with my husband. I feel like hiding away. I don't want to be noticed. No, you need to be visible again or you'll be forgotten. You're surprising. What should I do? The new collection is due. We'll have a tighter fit, a softer fabric. It'll suit you better. It'll give you back all your... texture. My texture? Yes. Okay, I'll come back next week. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Sell those coats. It won't be raining next week. Don't discourage customers who like something. She looked cramped. She disappeared in this coat. Enough of your obsessive honesty. Do we have too many customers? She looked fragile. She must feel like she's competing with someone else. She needs to feel good. You're a clothes selling psychic! I mentioned you to HQ. Why? Don't tell the others, I'll be running three stores soon. Great. I said you could run one. It'd be great to keep working with you. - It's the store in La D?fence. - Really? 600 square meters, an in-store escalator. It's insane! You'd get a pay rise. - Okay? - That'd be fantastic. Are you sure I can do it? Don't tell me you're not sure of yourself. You're reliable. You have a lot of potential. But don't screw up sales like you did just now. I had work to do, hon. Otherwise I'd have had to come back at 7 AM. You shouldn't let them take advantage, hon. Well, I may get to manage a big store at La D?fence. Really? Good. I hope you get a pay rise. Well, it's not a sure thing. Come on, I'd like to make it to the restaurant before them, for once. I'm living my best life now. It's true. I have a great job, great kids, my best friend near me. That's cool. I look a lot younger than I am. Well, I do! I'm happy, that's all. And a great husband. My dear, don't spoil this very emotional moment. - What about you, Marc? - What? Are you living your best life? Yeah, I am, but... I'll be truly fulfilled when I become International Key Account Manager. And I think I'll get it soon. - Really? - Yes. You said that before you were Export Manager. Export Manager is very different to International Key Account Manager. Well, my life is a complete success. Waking up with you is a dream. What, Marc? - Creep! - Thanks. I agree. What about you, L?a? - Me? - Is your life a success? I don't know what that means actually. She doesn't know! Maybe it's just... being happy doing what you do. - You're so cute. - Stop it! It's true. Look. You deserve better than just selling clothes. What? Karine, I like being in that mall and seeing different people. - She does. - I'm happy. L?a's legendary lack of ambition! Ah, see what I mean, kitten? Excuse me, have you chosen the dessert? Yes, I'm tempted by the floating island. Sir? Just a coffee for me. Me too, just a coffee. No dessert for me, thanks. - Are you sure? - Yeah, no. I'm too full. Okay, so that's - two coffees. - Right. And a floating island. You got it. Thanks. If no one's having dessert, I won't, either. Go on, have a dessert. I'm watching what I eat. No, it's okay. Our floating island is made the traditional way. And it's fantastic. See? Go on! No, really... No, I won't have a dessert, thanks. - Look, have it. Don't make a face. - I'm not making a face. We'll wait while you eat it! To be nice to my friend, I'll have another look. - You're giving in. - Yes. Okay. Excuse me, sir. We are getting dessert. So, a floating island and... And... And... No, I'm sorry, there's nothing I like. - False alarm. - Nothing. Nor for me. Okay. Kitten, I'll have a dessert too if you like. No, you wouldn't let me forget it all night. - What? - It's true. - Nonsense. - It's true. If you need me, I'll be over there. If we change our minds! I'll fix this. How about a floating island and four spoons? Yes! Then I can have a mouthful of yours. - Sir? - Yes. So, we'll have a floating island and four spoons. Right. - Final answer. - You idiot! - Okay, a floating island... - No, excuse me. Actually, three spoons. I don't like floating islands. They're soft and wobbly. I don't even call it a dessert. Great, I don't want it now. Okay, no spoons, thanks. Sorry, I'll just repeat the order to be sure. No desserts and no spoons, right? Right. Are you having coffee or is that up for debate? No, it's okay. It's late, have a floating island. I don't want it now. There's also the chocolate melty, the sorbet assortment, rum baba with whipped cream, or the Napoleon. That's damn delicious! I don't like it. Give us a couple of hours. My wife can't make quick decisions. - That's not nice. - It's true. - I'll be right there. - Thanks. I know! I'll have an apple turnover. I love that. With ice cream. - Yes. - Good idea. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Everything works itself out, even the world's big problems! You're a genius, my love. - We've made our minds up. - Definitely. We're sure of ourselves. So, please note it down. So, we're having... Apple turnover. Apple turnover with vanilla ice cream, three spoons, and of course, a floating island and a spoon for my wife who won't share. - Exactly. There's no apple turnover. Yes, there is. It says so on the menu. It's crossed out. I'm sorry, but there's none left. I thought it was underlined. It's not very clear. - It's not. - None left. It's not obviously crossed out. - Not well crossed out. - Thanks. Are you cross eyed? That was a lousy joke. Sorry. I didn't see it. Well, nothing for me. - Well, nothing for me, thanks. - Nothing? I'm over there. - Oh, wow! - He's not happy. - You're just too much. - What? He's here to work, not to have fun. He's working, you're like: "I want..." You're incapable of making a decision. Totally incapable! And I should know. I was clear from the start. No one's having a dessert, so nor am I. No, you're not clear. Forget the dessert. That's a detail. It's about taking some initiative in life. - You're impossible. - True. I do take the initiative sometimes. Really, when? At Christmas? And even then... - Do you know what I'm doing? - Yes... - I'm writing a book. - Are you now? Who for? No, a book, not a letter. Forget it, it doesn't matter. You brought it up. Hey, come on, tell us more. What for? I wanted to finish it first. I'm not sure I'll ever finish it. Forget it. I don't understand. Do you think I do? A month ago, I posted a review of Michel Bourne's new book on Facebook. You wrote to him? I sent my review of his book and put it on Facebook. Michel Bourne? And he said I wrote well and I should take it further. - Who's Michel Bourne? - Wow! That's what you were up to on vacation! While we were sunbathing, Madam was secretly writing literature. Calm down. She didn't say literature. - She mentioned a book. - I repeat... Can I repeat my question? Who's Michel Bourne? - Well, really! - Michel Bourne! - You don't know? - No! Marc, he's France's greatest living author. Greatest living author! He's not Victor Hugo, is he? What? - No, but... - So, did he hit on you? No, he just said I should write. He said that, honey, because he was hitting on you. Maybe he didn't even reply. Those guys don't do that. They have community managers. He also said I had something original and unique. - He was hitting on her! - You believed him? It's flattering. He's kinda cute. Sorry. I just told him I wanted to write, how in school, I filled lots of notebooks with stories. One day, I got up and... Excuse me, it's 11 PM. The sitter is... - Oh, shit, yes! - Sorry. - That's okay. - Where's that waiter? - Excuse me! - Where the hell is he? I don't want you writing to strangers on the net. Are you crazy? It's not on. I mean it. - It's on me. - Thanks. That's nice. Well, I'll pay for the desserts! - Did you get it? - Yes, thanks, sweetie. Enough already. Why didn't you tell me? I feel hurt. I encourage you, and you hide stuff. Oh, are you hurt? I'm sorry. I didn't think I could write a thing. Oh, okay. But be honest, Michel Bourne hit on you? No, I don't think so. I hope he was being sincere. If he's a good writer, he added a subtext. And the subtext is, he wants to sleep with you. No, I didn't see that at all. Because he's good at writing subtexts. There are no photos of me on Facebook. Their type don't care. Those guys who sleep with their admirers go for quantity, not quality. It makes them feel powerful. They're ogres, like all artists. - Have you slept with someone famous? - I'm saying nothing! - What're they doing? - No idea. Let's go, my love. I mean, I have Francis... A man of few words, but they're sincere. What are you looking at? See? What are you looking at? That's it. End of story. - C'mon, hon. - Okay. Is L?a a good writer? No way. At school, she sucked at spelling and grammar. I was brilliant at it. I'd help her all the time. How does Marc put up with her? Her indeterminacy must drive him nuts. - You never say that. - What? "Indeterminacy." You usually like small, simple words. Are you calling me a cretin? No, it just surprised me, coming from you. How on earth can she be serious about being a writer? It's crazy. Imagine Michel Bourne complimenting a saleswoman? I don't get it. "You write discount signs so well, ma'am. 20% off! Well done." "Everything must go. Such style." "Closing down sale. Beautiful writing." Stop it. You're being mean about my best friend. In any case, I think she's very brave. Writing a book just because of some guy on Facebook. That sure takes guts. Well, you know L?a. It doesn't take much to get her all worked up. Why don't you write a book? - Stop it. - Why not? It's funny you say that because I thought about it. - If L?a can do it, why can't I? - Sure. And I have lots to tell. - Sure you do. - Lots of... You bet. I'm right behind you. And I never talked about it, but... I really want to start composing. I've thought about it. What's stopping me? I could buy software and a keyboard and work in the cellar. Why not? Yeah. Why not? Sure, honey. Why not? Do it! Who cares? And I'll write a novel. And I'll finish first. - We're not stupid. - No. I'm already getting lots of ideas. Ideas galore! Yeah, we're no more stupid than anyone else. While I wake up the sitter, I'll keep creating stuff. I'll be just fine in the cellar. I won't bother anyone. I didn't like it when you contradicted me. - When? - When I suggested the Napoleon. You know I don't like it. The Napoleon, the sorbet assortment... Who doesn't like sorbet? And that business about the writer... So, you write now? I always have. - Really? - Yes. Well, what do you write? What comes into my head. I observe people. It'll be some book! Well, I don't know... It's amazing when you really look at people. Really? Know what I see? I see how important my job is. Aluminium is everywhere. Look. Here, here, here... Everyone in France uses 20 kilos of aluminium a year. How is your novel coming along? Michel Bourne I'm still writing it. I hope I'll finish it one day. - Hey, only three left. - Pardon? Only three left on the short list for La D?fence. I keep talking about you, they love me. - I'm sure it'll work out. - Thanks. Oh, did that woman ever come back? This really suits me. I love it. I knew it. Hang on. My therapist agrees with you. I need to step things up a gear. I'll take the yellow dress and that coat. Do you agree? Oh, yes. You'll look irresistible. Wow, great job, L?a. I'm impressed. You see, when you're cramped, it goes well! Well done. Look how that new guy sells aluminium. It's like he's selling lingerie. Blah blah blah... That jerk might steal my new job. No, don't worry, he's no match for you. What do they teach them in those fancy schools? I could whip his ass. He doesn't understand you must love aluminium. It's precious. Almost as precious as gold. But he... Where's he going? I don't believe it! No way, he's going to lunch with the bosses. You're not writing a book, too? No, the expenses. Ah, you had me worried. You made me want to write a novel. Really? Great. With your imagination, I'm sure it'll be good. So do I. Did you start with the beginning? Did you go in chronological order? Yeah, a start, a middle, and an end. The usual. Yeah, well, I think I'll deconstruct it. Why not change the codes? I'll have flashbacks, flash-forwards when you go into the future. Yeah, I know. I'm incredibly observant, so I need to use my talents. For example, I'd say that guy is... - Classy. - A dancer. Flamenco. No, but I mean, everything inspires me. Oh, look at those two. What a couple! What do you think? They've been married for three years. - They work in the same firm... - No! They're having an affair. The guy is looking around, worried. She's totally in love. Look, dilated pupils, clammy palms, fast breathing. They look so guilty. That's adultery. Caught red handed! Hey, look how they're kissing. - They're not married. - I see you. I know your wife. I'll tell her. I'll tell her everything! Who are they? Let's go. Hey, they're going! We scared him! He really thought we knew his wife. He thought we were crazy! Oh, wow, look at the lady in blue. Her dog looks like her mini me! Hey, she's talking to her dog. It's her double! It looks like her as a key ring! Crazy! You're right! You're so good at this. - Well, I'll give you that one for free. - What? My observation on the lady. Have it for your novel. Well, you know what? Maybe. Yeah, help yourself. I have so many ideas. I'm like a pressure cooker. I feel like an erupting volcano. Maybe I'll finish first. You won't be mad? Because inspiration strikes me 24/7. Kitten! Kitten... Are you nearly finished? What are you doing? Come on. So, married life is a thing of the past? Kitten... I'm coming. Leave that alone. Come here. Kitten... What do you want? You! Me? What would you do with me? Turn the light off. You'll see. Hmm, tempting... I was using that. Don't grab. A superb body Today is a big day. I'm writing my first novel. #MyLifeAsAWriter #GreatLiterature - Give it back! - No! - Give it back. - No. Make less noise. Mum is writing her first novel. A beautiful, successful woman. - Give it back. Let go! - Stop making a face. - You stop making a face. - That's enough! No! Give it back! Okay, stop. Go to your room. - Your fault. - Yours. Write Your First Novel in 30 Days What a pain to wire this up. You gotta be an engineer! You remind me of Bradley Cooper. - Like this? - Oh, yeah. You're so cute! - Am I? - Honestly. Don't move. Look at me. Hang on. So handsome. You're irresistible. I'll post it. The artists' place #BradleyCooperlsMyHusband It's doing me good to put my rage down on paper. Well, don't make a mess! Idiot! The show must go on. What is that? The street was empty The street was full of people It was the apocalypse Look at that! She's so lazy. - What is it? - The lab results. - It was her lipstick and DNA. - I knew it. Sit down. Will you... be my first reader? We're just about to find out who the killer is. I'd like you to read my first book. Hang on. You can't do without my opinion! No. Alright, then. What are you doing? I want to see your reaction. Look, kitten, I never read... If the author is watching me, I can't do it. Give me time. - Okay. - Don't worry, love. I'll love it. Was it out of love or just for my physique? Love, hate, power. Those are the three possible motives. Oh, shit, wow! - Hello, my love. - How's it going? - Yeah, you? - Yes. - I showed a house to some clients. - Yeah. I played them my music. The street was empty... My boss told me not to. Really? Even though they signed. Crazy! Creation really bothers people. When you think about it, it's like people are jealous when you're creative. Of course they are. You're open to infinity, you run around, hair in the wind... while they're stuck in their mediocre little lives. Can you run along? I don't want to get distracted from my writing. - You're writing? - Look. Paul Val?ry drew before he wrote. Rimbaud took opium. Well, I'm cleaning the kitchen. That's smart. Let's show each other our work on Sunday. No, not yet. I bet Pierre and Marie Curie did that at weekends. "What's new, hon?" "Well, I discovered polonium." - Idiot! - "Well done, dear. And you?" "I worked on piezoelectric quartz." Stop it, I'll lose my inspiration. You're a pain! Sorry. Okay, I'll go compose something. Go on. And I'll write. Okay, hon? Just fine, hon! I started reading your thing. So, two years ago, you nearly left me? No. What are you talking about? The characters aren't us in the book. - It's not us? - No. I'm sorry, but you must really think I'm stupid. Look. "Franck's great obsession in life is copper." Not me? No, it's not you. "Franck lives like a gorilla." Thanks. "He physically dominates others." I'm not like that at all. You've only read half and that's all that struck you? They're married in the book, it's not us. And this: "He'd limited his intelligence to his primal urges." - I'm not like that. - No... Look, I also say: "Franck's my captain. He protects me from the storm. He's loving and reassuring." I don't just write bad things about him. He's great. Anyway, it's not us. Don't send that. He's a jerk. People will recognise me. Look, honey, you said it yourself, he's a jerk, it's not you! I won't read it and give you my opinion. Hello. Uh, yes, it's my first novel. - Let's meet next week. - Next week? Next week, yes, of course. I'll text you the details. - Thanks. - Goodbye. Wow. Oh, two publishers phoned me today... Oh, I've started writing! - Really? - Yes. I knew I had a gift, but I think I've really found my style. What's it about? I wanted to write about Francis striving to seduce me, how he conquered the fortress I represented to him. You don't say! I think it can give women hope and men courage, and vice versa. I think I've found a universal subject. Great. I can't wait to read it. Have you made progress? Have some self confidence, for once, L?a. Well, actually... I'm done. Really? You've already given up? I knew it. No, Karine! I've finished my novel. - No! - What? You're crazy. It's impossible to finish so fast. - Why? - Well, Rome wasn't built in a day. Well, it just flowed out. Two publishers replied today. Let me guess: "Though we found it very interesting..." - They're awful. - Yes, but I got two positive replies. - Wow. - Cool, huh? - Did you put in the lady in blue? - Yes. Hey, it's copyrighted. You owe me royalties for that. Sure! - Has your writer Michel Bourne read it? - Yes. He told me it was ready to send to his publisher, Gremillard. - Gremillard? - Yes. 3,300 is a lot. Plus travel costs. He said: "If you leave the firm, the firm's over." Look at the house Marc found for our vacation. We'll look after dinner, okay? Up to you. Karine said Gremillard want to meet you for your book. Yeah. - Great, L?a. - Thanks. Is Gremillard a good publishing house? Gremillard is only the most prestigious publisher. - Really? - They sure aren't the worst! I think I'll pick them too for my novel when it's finished. Did you like L?a's book? Well, I didn't... I didn't... I didn't read it all. - No time... - No, with the Chinese, we've been inundated. He didn't read it? I've just been so busy. - Yes. - But I'll read it. What counts is getting ready to read it. It's on my to do list. I read that Gremillard had turned down several big writers. So, they're not always perspicacious. Well, they sure didn't miss my kitten! They got her alright! Well, it's weird they're in such a hurry. Why? It's weird they're in such a hurry to publish you. Read the contract. Warning. - Why? - Publishers rip off writers. - Nonsense. - They do. - I'm telling you. - She's right. Are you a bit jealous? - Absolutely not! - Look at you. I'm so happy for her. Cut it out. Don't get carried away. I'm just meeting them. There you are. See? She always thinks people are kind, like her. Don't sign till you discuss it with me. - Stop it. - I mean it. - Really? - Of course. If they think they can rip you off, they don't know me! - She's right. - We'll read that contract and bring Gremillard to its knees. Why tell them I hadn't read your book? You told them, not me. You said you had too much work 'cause of the Chinese. Well, I looked like a jerk, again. So, read it, then. Make sure it doesn't affect your job and your promotion. No, it's okay, don't worry. Everything will stay the same forever. Really? Yes, captain. They convicted an innocent man But the innocent man is innocent Guilty! You made him guilty You spilled his blood They convicted an innocent man To death, he's innocent You spilled his blood They convicted an innocent man To death, he's innocent Guilty! You made him guilty Why do they want to kill him, Dad? It's just a song. Don't be scared. But he didn't do anything. No, he didn't do a thing. Forget it. It's just a song. Go upstairs. I'll be right with you. - Are you coming? - Yes, we are. - The song was too powerful. - Yes. It's not suitable for children. No... I wrote it in the spirit of... "J'accuse" by Zola, see? Well, it's very... Maybe without lyrics? Oh, no! It all goes together. It works as a whole. I call it political electro. - David Guetta meets Bob Dylan. - Yeah. They convicted an innocent man But the innocent man is innocent Okay, that's enough because I have to... digest it now I've heard it. - Up to you, my love. Can't I read what you've written? No, I don't dare. I think it's indecent to get others to read it. My love, L?a does. That's what artists do. Yeah, well, don't you think that L?a... - What? - Well, that she... - What? - Well, that she has... - Put on weight? - No! She's gotten a bit... Big-headed? There you are, you see? You think so, too. I thought no-one else had noticed, but it shows. - Stop it. - You don't know her... - No, honestly... - You don't know her like me. She never stops. Gremillard this, Actes Sud that. "I'm going to be published!" No, she's changed! I don't know. I think you... Well, you're not objective. Right... I'll read it to you, but... It's not completely ready. I wanted a hard-hitting start. You'll see, it may surprise you. Don't justify yourself, my love. You're a genius. I know. Sometimes I forget it. "Today, Mum died. Or maybe yesterday. The telegram from the home says: 'Mother deceased. Funeral tomorrow. Deep sympathy.' That means nothing. Maybe it was yesterday." So? Isn't that... "The Stranger" by Albert Camus? Oh, you know it. Yeah. My love, everyone knows it. - Really? - From school. I know. It was just to get me started. I wouldn't leave it like that. It was to get me going. I'd have changed it. Instead of "Today, Mum died", I'd have put "Yesterday, Dad was out walking." It's not the same. "Funeral tomorrow" would have become "Party today". - I see. - It's different. Sure. That changes everything. But you should've changed it, then read it, so I'd have a fresh ear. It's not easy. I want to be inspired by other stuff. I've no time with the kids. It's not a criticism, my love. And even if you couldn't do it... So what? It doesn't matter. It'd be disastrous. I want to finish this novel, see? It matters. I didn't start it only to give up. Can you hold me? Sweetheart, you know... Maybe we chose the wrong art. I'll take up sculpture. I feel that literature is my thing. It really is. It drives me crazy that L?a stole my art. - Hello, L?a Monteil. - Hello. Well, I was very impressed by your book. Oh! Thank you. - Hi, I'm Sylvain. - Hi. I want a January release. You'll be busy, doing corrections, promoting it. The thing is, I work in a store. The end-of-year period is... Don't worry, we'll work it out. It's just that I may be offered a job as the manager of a bigger store. Talk to Sylvain. He'll handle the publishing side. Welcome. - Sylvain, look after her. - Yes, sir. So, does that mean... you'll publish it? I think sculpture is my thing. I'm having a break. I need it because... I'm trying to get deep inside myself. You feel fragile. What is it? A horse. Is it? Yes, there's a horse in there. I'm trying to get it out. There's a horse in there? It must be bored stiff! Start with something simpler. My love, it's not me that decides, it's the stone. - You wouldn't understand. - No. Everything's simple when you know how. - We should do an exhibition. - Crazy! - We should. - No! - We should. - No, it's too soon. It's really beautiful. Don't move. What? It's not a horse in there... It's you! - I'll bring you out. - Nonsense! - Will you pose for me? - Stop it! Like this? Put your hand behind you, like that. Your head... Don't move. Let yourself go. You remind me of Rodin. I'm your Camille Claudel. Yeah... There. Oh, you're so beautiful! You're like The Winged Victory of Samothrace. She has no head! Exactly. That's why you're even prettier. 'Cause you got a head. You know the Winged Victory of Samothrace? You know lots. You're always surprising me. You always think I'm a bit of an idiot. No! I love it when you use complicated words. Kiss me. Want a hand? - Let me work. - Sorry. I won't make any progress for that exhibition of yours. I'll get back to work, too. I'll do a horse. No, a pony. It'll be quicker. Lost in the Mall It's really something. We have lots to do. I'll have all this sent over to you. The press agent will do a list of VIPs to sign copies for. - Okay. There'll be a photo shoot. We need photos of you smiling for the press. Just like you're smiling now. Okay. L?a... Look. Know what this is? - No. - Try to guess. - Well, I don't know. - Guess. No idea. Read it. It says you're the manager at La D?fence. - That's great! - Yes. You're in the big league. Yes, that's good. But... Everything's happening at once. Don't tell me you're pregnant. Oh, no. Ah! You had me worried. I told you: If I back you up, it'll work. I'm so pleased. - Time to celebrate. - Nice idea. To us, kitten. I'll just have a sip, I have lots more to do. It's not the writer's job to do all this, is it? Writers have to sign their books, hon. Did you cut out the dumb husband bit? Finish the book and you'll find out. I see, you haven't cut it out. - "To Gilles Bouleau." - Leave it. Well, well... "To the newsreader who is in my home every day." Our home! "You unknowingly accompanied my daily writing. Yours truly!" - You know Gilles Bouleau? - No. Well, he'll think you're hitting on him. No, that's just the way it's done. You'll write "Yours truly" to 200 guys you don't know? Yes, because if I write "With love", they might get the wrong idea! Well, it's not very clear. And is that title final? "Lost in the Mall." I preferred "The Imaginary Butterfly". It was more appealing. Yeah, well, the publisher thought it sounded like a children's book. Oh, yes, the publisher... You'd rather listen to the publisher. What I think... I won't make a big deal out of it... Make a big deal out of what? It's being sent out this week. I can't change the title now. Hey, now wait a minute! Chill out! You're not Victor Hugo. How do you know? You haven't read it. Have you read Victor Hugo? You never read a thing. That's a disgusting thing to say. Now you're around fancy intellectuals, you attack me? I work in aluminium. It's less glamorous than Gilles Boil. Without it, there's no printing press, no books, and you sell nothing! Do you think Gilles Thingamajig will save your ass? No. It's the jerk who works in aluminium. Don't forget that. Victor Hugo! Oh, I'm sorry. It's not what I meant. I'm so sorry. What is this photo? Look. That's not you. I don't recognise you. You've changed. You've changed, L?a. You liked that photo. I won't discuss it now. I have important stuff to do tomorrow. Goodnight. Look. Wow! It's made out to "my sister, my Karine. Thanks for all your support." Too right! "Your lady in blue has come a long way. I wish you every happiness. Big kisses, L?a." What's the lady in blue thing? It's an idea I gave her. You worked with her? No, I just gave her a few ideas. I don't tell you everything. But don't mention it so I don't look like I'm bragging. You're incredible! While you write a book, you help her with hers. You impress me so much, my love. Now stop it. Let's read it and talk later. Your hands are so soft. What? It's not... Anyway. Yeah... I don't want to be mean, but I think it's crazy a big publisher should put that out. I like it. I think it's funny and touching. People might like it. Well, it lacks pace, passion... literature. It's bland, apart from the lady in blue. The lady in blue is one line. No, two lines. Two very evocative lines. If that can get published, I'll get even more published. I'm hungry. Should I defrost the chicken? Oh, gosh! Or some pasta? I'll see what there is. I think we still have some... Yes, there's still some chilli con carne. Okay with you, sweetie? - Sweetie? - Yeah. Chilli? You got it. What a lot of books. Of course, hon. Bookstores sell books. Not sausages. - It's my first novel. - Congratulations. - Goodbye. - Thanks. Well, like I said, we loved it. - It's so cool. - See? - It's very nice. Lots of good bits. - Thanks. You can really see your... your clear-sighted view of people. - True. - Yeah. I loved it. We both did. Yes, we did. Well, thank you. Your opinion means a lot. Oh, how kind. But worryingly, the site, AB Reader didn't like it. - AB? - AB Reader. - What is it? - A blog. They said it isn't literature. - Nonsense. - So harsh. What a bunch of arseholes. Well, it doesn't matter. They don't have to like it. What do they know? Come on! It's a book website, so they know books. I can throw together a book site. Well, if it's not literature, what is it? It means they think it's a bad book. Do you enjoy hurting L?a with your stupid goddamn questions? Sorry, L?a, if I... Francis, don't worry. And you know, the reviews are largely positive. - Really? - Good. I hate people criticising you. - Dumb intellectuals! - So annoying. I tried those duck wings. - Mouth-watering. - Where? There. You can see it's a good publisher. He's a walking belly! - They're great. - Let me taste first. It's a pretty quiet street. Hello. - I loved your book. - Thank you. Could I get a photo with you? Sure. Come here. I can do it. No, it's okay, thanks. - Thanks. - My pleasure. First time a stranger has asked for a photo! Crazy! I have lots of photos of you. - Silly! - I'll sell them! So, you're a star now? Oh, don't! - All the fans want your photo? - Idiot! Well, L?a, we haven't sold very many today. Nope. But the buzz is very positive. So, it'll improve, trust me. Thanks, Sylvain. Hi, I'm Karine L?ger. L?a's best friend. - I'm writing a novel, too. - I see. But I won't mention it today. L?a is the star today, so... We'll be pleased to read it. Okay. Anyway, enough said. Not today, sir. Ready? I'm reading the press kit. There'll be changes. Okay. Hey, Karine. L?a Monteil, is she the friend you eat with sometimes? - Yes. - Really? I love her! I recognised her photo. Her book is amazing. I'd never heard of it. My wife read it, then I read it in one go. Really? She's a genius at observing people. There's everyone in her mall. - Well, good for you. - Known her long? Oh, yeah, since we were kids. No way? I must meet her. You're crazy. She has a guy. No, to congratulate her. To say... Oh, wow! Well, you're lucky to know her. - Don't exaggerate. - You are. - Can I tell you something? - What? Tell me. The lady in blue was my idea. Lady in blue? Lady in blue... Page 82. The lady in blue. Yes, the lady in blue! No! That was... Yeah? Cool. So, set up a coffee with her. Okay. Kids, leave Dad's art alone. It's a surprise. I identified with the heroine. I just wanted to say I loved your book. - Loved it. - Thanks, I'm touched. I can't wait to read the next one. Well, I'm writing it. She sure is working hard. - I'm already halfway through. - Wow! Yeah. It is a lot of work and organisation, but it's so... Excuse me, sweetie. This is Francis's big day, you see? So, don't go on about your book, for his sake. No, but they asked me. Yes, but I really had to nag him to do this. He's so modest, you know. Thanks. Attention, everyone! Francis is going to reveal his sculptures. Gather round. My aim was to work on the material. - What is it? - It's great. - But what is it? - It's a bird. A bird... So? It's beautiful, powerful... massive. Interesting. That's not all. Follow me. Now this is very different. It's more... slender. Like it? Yes, more ethereal. Let's continue, Francis. People love it. Yes, I can tell. It's great. Now this is my favourite. - Oh, yes... - It's Karine. It's Karine? Her face... her legs. Kind of. He's starting on noble stone soon. - Carrara marble is his calling. - Carrara marble. Hey, read us that sculptor's quote. She means Giacometti. It's so pretty. "The great adventure of seeing something uncharted emerge from the same face. The greatest of round the world trips." Bravo! That's what he wanted to capture about me. My uncharted side. Yep. That's like poetry. Yeah. - He did it so fast... - It's Aunt L?a! Oh, so it is. The newsflash says: "The Interalli? prize for L?a Monteil's first book, 'Lost in the Mall' which has sold 50,000 copies." - Congratulations. - That's my kitten! Well done, hon. - Bravo! - Thank you. Why didn't you tell me? Oh, well, today is about Francis. I didn't want... Well, it's fantastic. - Well, it is... - Bravo. So... Here's something else. Out of the way. L?a didn't even deign to tell me about her award. - Really? - She was still upset. - You think? - For sure. Success changes people. It's the same old story. I was there for her when she needed me. She was pleased to have me, then. Never mind, hon. If she's changed, she'll get over it. I'm doing well, too. I am a creative director. You're not in the same league. You're in a league of your own. I'll always be "good ol' Karine" everyone knows and likes. If she doesn't need her best friend as soon as a paper mentions her, then we don't have much... Oh, it's her. She's calling to apologise. I know her so well. Yes, L?a? Yes! Thanks, I'll tell him. Really? Wow, that's great! That's fantastic. I'm so happy for you. I'll call you back. We're clearing up. Congratulations. Bye. She's going on the evening news. That's great! She called me just to rub it in. Do you really think people are nice? Why are you so quiet? - I'm not. - You didn't say a thing in the car. You're gonna leave me, I know it. Why would I leave you? Why would you live with a gorilla? Stop it. Why would you stay when TV journalists and writers hit on you? - They don't. - If it hasn't happened, it will. So, you're jealous preemptively in case a famous writer tries to hit on me one day? Why a "famous writer"? You mean Michel Bourne who's been after you? No, it was just an example. Yeah... You said it. It wasn't random. - He's 65, so... - That won't stop him. Oh, come on! You're the one I love and want to share all this with you. Yeah, you love me. Sure! Are you hungry, my love? I'm starving. My love, I can warm up the eggplant gratin. And a salad. How does that sound? - Okay. - You got it. You know, I want to write in alexandrines. Yeah... It's like a song without music. I think that'd really suit me. I can't do this, hon. - What's wrong? - Well, I... I can't write, I can't create. I'll never become an artist. I thought I could. You're just very hungry. And you're tired. So, you're going to eat, then, you'll think more clearly, make a nice masterpiece. I have so much I wanted to get out. Ever so much! I really deserved a book with my name on the front and my photo on the back. But I can't get anything out. I don't know how to do it. I'll go for a run. - Wait till next weekend. - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. You be careful, my love, it's getting dark outside. Don't worry. Oh, shit! 12 feet! I made an alexandrine. I decide to write alexandrines, I do one without meaning to! "You be careful, my love, it's getting dark outside." Kids, Dad just did an alexandrine in the street! It's very pretty. The colour is amazing! Oh, it's that writer! It's you? Hello. Is it really you? Yes, it is. Oh, that's crazy! Can we get a photo? - Sure. - Oh, thank you! Know who she is? Yes, my saleswoman. Thank you. - Thank you. - Well done. Thanks. Goodbye. - What did they want? - To see if it was me. If it was you? What does that mean? I don't get it. L?a, come here. What is that? That's you! Paul, let me explain. I wrote a book. Then, lots of people bought it. So, I've been on TV, that's all. But it's nothing. It's going to stop. - Won't it change things for La D?fence? - No. It's a hobby, like stamp collecting. It's nothing much. Really it's nothing! Hello. What is this? ...in a mall and I began to watch the passersby and the staff. I started making up stories, living with them and trying to understand who they were. Have you always written? I filled notebooks with stories I made up. I gradually turned it into completely made up stories... sensations and characters which don't exist... Sorry. Without realising it, they became myriad characters who started interacting, then it became "Lost in the Mall". - I did 11.77 kms. - Wow! The change in altitude is 5.26%! And lots of little hills. All in 67 minutes. I'm not surprised. I have to share my time. - I have to get below an hour. - That's great. I've decided to take up Japanese bonsai. - What? - Japanese bonsai. It's art, too. It's so interesting. You just get a tree and you're good. I have to do the first 12 kms in 60 minutes, for the marathon. My tree is the trident maple. Look, it loses its leaves in the fall. Yeah, it's a tree! Well, it's very rare and very pretty. Take a look. No. I'll take a shower. Tomorrow I'll go a big circuit. 25 kms in two hours 15. Then, I'll have a sleep. I saw it from downstairs. Look. What's that? 250,000 copies sold. Call that a hobby? You said it was nothing. Why have you sold so many, L?a? I'm sorry. People bought it. It's not my fault. I didn't think it'd come to this, Paul. I wanted to tell you I can't accept the job at La D?fence. You've lost your mind. What have you made? 5,000? 10,000? It's a tidy sum, but will it continue? No, Paul, it's about 200,000. - 200,000? - Yes. No such thing! It's an abstract sum. It's better to earn 1,800 a month than 200,000. A paycheck is every month. I'm so sorry, Paul. Hey, come here. You'd have gotten a big bonus. Thanks, Paul, but I'm handing in my notice. Think it over. Don't turn your back on your destiny. Thanks, Paul. We wish you a very happy retirement. I'm going to miss you all so much. Sandrine, don't worry about your loyal customers. Thierry, our great new International Key Account Manager, - will be in charge now. - Thank you. Well done! Now let's enjoy the buffet. Raise a glass. To your very good health! Raise a glass to Sandrine. To Sandrine! You could have waited for me. Help yourself. Did you drink all that on your own? They chose Thierry to replace Sandrine. I really wanted that job. In the end, they picked that cretin who can barely do a spreadsheet! Oh, no! Just 'cause he'd worked abroad and made lots of contacts. But he can't speak Romanian! I wanted that job. It was for me. Okay, come with me. I'm the one who decides tonight. - No... - Come on. - What? - Here. What's this? My first royalty check. - Are you serious? - Yes. - Can I? - Be my guest. It's there. - There? - Yes. What are we doing here? I booked a room. Oh, I see! Because I didn't get that job, you took pity on me? No. How could I have known? Look, kitten... that bike is gorgeous! I've always wanted one. I can't accept the room, too. I can't be a kept man. I just can't. Let's go home. Are you sure? We're right outside. You suck! You haven't cleaned the leaves. Good. Good. Cut that. Good. This thing just won't grow! You cut the leaves, Francis. - You told me to. - I didn't. You did. I didn't. You watered it too much. The soil's sticky. You told me to do it. I didn't. You did. I didn't. Time for the tea ceremony. Our journey toward serenity. It's not working. I feel like I'm watering a stone each time. Stop listening to your ego. Prepare the tea slowly with the bamboo whisk. You'll feel centred. I won't make the tea. I'm out of here! Nothing happened. Carry on. - How were the bonsai? - Lousy. And it's freezing in there. They're so dull. At one point, the master asked me to make the tea. Me! I wanted to punch his lights out. What an arsehole! - I thought you liked it. - Oh, no! I made a mistake. I'm no good at it. A bit like you with literature. Don't say things like that! Don't annoy me. I'm already annoyed! The sitter cancelled. I'm not going. Shit. No, you can't do that to L?a. No, you go. I'll stay. - Really? - Sure. I really hate these social events. I say again, I take no credit in discovering you, L?a. Your huge success proves that anyone would have, confronted with your talent. So, how does it feel to be Mr. L?a Monteil? I'm still Marc Serrier. I'm certain that you'll continue to surprise us. Well done, my dear L?a. - It's nice of Michel Bourne to come. - Yes. - Pity, she could have run a store. - I know. But she wants to write. It's up to her. One more person would like to speak about you. My L?a... Who would have thought you'd become a writer? I did. I believed in you. Every day, right from the start. I encouraged you when you lost hope, like a swimming instructor helping you back to the beach and giving you a hot drink. I was there for you like Colette's cat meowing in your ear: Meow, did you write today? Meow, correct it and start over. Meow, my L?a. Remember when we were observing passersby, I showed you the famous lady in blue. Page 82. Thank you. But you deserve the credit. I always protected you like a sister. Now you're living your life. You're getting away from me, but all this is wonderful. L?a... We are honoured to confer upon you the well deserved award of Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters. Bravo! - It was great, so moving. - Thanks for your speech. You're welcome. You know, I just jotted it down. Champagne, wine or water? I'll have some wine... No, champagne. Water... I don't know. I'll have wine. Thanks. I'll have water, then. Your indecision hasn't changed! Right. Hi. May I ask you a question? Excuse me. You can't disturb Mrs. Monteil like that. Where's your press agent? You can't have a moment to yourself. - Where is she? I'll speak to her. - No! Karine, don't make a fuss! Excuse me, can L?a Monteil sign my book? No, she's too busy. Hold this for me. - What's your name? - Bertrand. Yours truly. - L?a. - Yes? I'm not going home with you. I need some space. What? Listen... I'll move in above my sister's. I... I can't be the pianist's groupie. What're you talking about? This is for us. No, I didn't choose all this. The parties in your honour, the... the motorbike, the fans, your nights spent writing, it's not for me. You're passionate about your work. Why can't I be? - Can't you just be pleased for me? - No! I can't, right now. I just need some time to think. I'm sorry. - You're still up? - I was waiting for you. So, how was it? Never ending. So long! And my feet are killing me. L?a barely thanked me for my fine speech. Really? She has a hot air balloon for a head! She doesn't even realise it. We all have our blind spots. No. I don't think I do. What are you doing? I've finally found my thing. It was in the saucepan! It was right under my eyes! I've always gone on about food, haven't I? Yes. Aren't you going to bed? Not now. I'm making beef and carrot stew. I have the carrots, the sauce... Sit down and watch me. No, honey. I won't watch you peeling carrots at 1 AM. I'm sorry, but... Up to you. We should stop meeting like this! I have some big news. Your second novel is breaking all records. Really? I can't believe it. I spoke to the producers' lawyers in LA. They're sending me the contract for the film rights. You okay? I just feel a bit sad because I have no one to share it with. I understand. Your ex is already bringing out her new book. Yes, but I'm still finishing the first. Do you like it? Yes, it's good, but the husband is nothing like me. Oh, no, it's not you. You have a bigger heart. That's nice. So, when your ex was there, you didn't read her book. Now she's gone, you read it. Make your mind up. Hello. After the signing, please go over to the checkout. Please go over to the checkout. - Hello. - Hello. What's your name? Hello. After the signing, please go over to the checkout. - Hello. What's your name? - Cassandre. - Thank you. - Thanks. Goodbye. Hello. What's your name? Marc Serrier. You know... I read the whole book this time. How can I say it? I'm not very good with words. Unlike you. Your book touches people because... you understand them just by observing them. So, all these people waiting to meet you... are grateful. It's only natural. I'm very proud of you. I bought your new book. I'll read it faster, I promise! - Thank you. - You know, I... People are waiting. Yes, I'm sorry. I couldn't handle all this... I didn't see you were much stronger than me. Here. Can you sign it with this? The best Australian alloy. I had it made just for you. - For me? It's beautiful. - You'll see that... - Move along. - I'll be quick. I had your initials engraved on it to remind you it's important to write by hand, too. Thank you. I'll sign my book with it. You can sign your contracts with it, too. You're making me cry. Here. Can I read it? "To Marc, my man, my captain, my love. Yours truly." - I've missed you! - I love you, kitten. Isn't it beautiful? Here's the living room. Look. - My books. - It's huge. Isn't it great? Look, my room. My bed. More books. You've gone completely crazy! I love it. I just love it! You haven't seen my study. Come on. You come here. I'm so pleased to see you again. Oh, my phone. Hang on. It's Sylvain. I must get this. Hi there. Yes... No. No! Let me check what I noted on my computer. - What're you doing here? - Incredible! You know, my office is back there. I had no idea. - Okay? - You? - Fine. - Yeah? All good? Yeah. Well... The Chinese are making life tough for us. - Really? - We're losing points. But the good news is that French alloys are still the best. How's L?a? Her new book's coming out, you know? So, what with the photos, interviews, her new place, she's swamped. She left me lots of messages. But unfortunately, I've been very busy. So, she's busy, too? - I don't know her schedule anymore. - Really? - Doesn't that bother you? - What can you do? I mean, you women have to change things all the time. Weren't we good before? Well, you must be proud. Sure, I'm proud. But I kinda feel sidelined now. She used to listen to me. Yeah, it's not easy. No, it's not. It really isn't. I feel inferior to her. That's why I didn't get that promotion. You'll bounce back. You have your head screwed on. I have no choice. When you're in my line of work, you must stay focused, stand up straight. The Chinese are coming for us. We're in trouble. Just as well we're here. That's what I miss most. - What? - Not seeing you. You and your jokes, your stories about the Chinese... Your presence, you know. So... come over for dinner. We'd like that. Sure, why not? - You got it. - Okay. Gotta get back to it. - Bye. - My heart rate's going down. - See you soon. - Bye. Quick steps! Why on earth did I invite them? It's great. I haven't seen Karine in ages. I can't wait. I miss her. Really? She said Francis is obsessed by cooking. If he cooks like he sculpts, he'll make us sick! And since Karine realised she couldn't write, she's become a running freak. That's not very nice. Oh, I don't know... Maybe. Hope they didn't hear us! Hello! - Okay? - The star and her husband! - Cut it out. Okay, Marc? - Great. - Hi. How's it going? - Hi. - Alright? - Yes, great. You're looking good. Am I? That'll be the running. I did 18 kms today in one hour 22. Wow! I've done it faster. - Really? - One hour 20. - Really? - Speedy Gonzales! Don't get too skinny. No, I'm sculpting my body. I'm drying out. She's drying out. I'm getting fat! We're not eating in the doorway. Come on in. In the doorway! Come over here. Look, I brought your favourite dessert. - A floating island. - It took him ages. Thanks, but I don't eat it now. - Nope. - Why not? I thought I liked it, but I realised I don't. I'll taste it, though. Come on in. She changed overnight. Karine doesn't eat, either. I do! I just eat vegetarian, gluten and lactose free, but there's still lots I can eat. Endives, water...! - Wow, it's huge. - See that? All these rooms, the mouldings. There's more. - It's Marie-Antoinette's! - Yeah. You ain't seen nothing yet. - Can I get you a drink? - Yeah. What would you like? A Ukrainian vodka would be ideal for me. Ukrainian... With crushed raspberries. I'm on a red berry kick. I'll see what we have. Water and seeds for you? No, a glass of wine for me. I'm careful about what I eat now. Oh, no problem, Francis. I'll put this in the fridge. Yes, 'cause it... - Be right back. - It needs to be kept cool. It seems impersonal to me. - Here. - Not too much. - Just a drop. - Thanks. I read your new novel. I wanted to give it to you. I didn't buy it. I knew you'd give it to us, so I pirated it. - Great! - How did you find it? I found it on a site... What's it called? No, the book. Did you like it? Oh, sorry. Silly me! Well, can I be honest? - Sure. - I thought the first one was... super. But this one... I didn't find it as powerful. I thought it was great. I see things like an athlete now. You didn't give it your all. I know you. You only went halfway. How can you say that? Well, I'm saying what I feel. Well, if I can use a culinary metaphor, I share Karine's opinion. - I thought it lacked seasoning. - Nonsense. Well, I don't think I cheated. I worked really hard on it. I loved it. Yeah, but the people who matter shower praise on you all day long. I can't be hypocritical. I mean, I'm not like that. I know that. Anyway, we don't count. You don't care what we think. I do. Why do you say that? Well, you're doing just fine. You're sure of yourself. You've made it, right? Made it... I don't know. I'm happy. I'm writing and I enjoy it. But I was happy, working in the store. The context has changed, that's all. The context sure has changed! You can't say you don't know what success is, with all this. Yeah, it's a nice place. - Yes. - It is a nice place. Right. You know, L?a, I do what you do now. I try to create every day, I'm obsessive. I think about grilling peppers with pineapples. I make Bolognaise sauce, new style. Okay, enough of your cooking. Peppers are tasty. We don't use them enough. No, we don't. - Honey, you... - What? You run all the time. You talk a lot about sport. - Sorry I'm passionate, too. - Okay. It's my way of achieving something. Show me around, Marc. Us simple folk who aren't creative. Okay, I'll show you around, but... I won't run! Well, this is our room. Oh, yes. We haven't finished moving in... - I preferred the old place. - Really? I like this one, but... I don't feel at home. Well, this is her study. - Big, isn't it? - Yeah. Come see the first bathroom. It's unreal. So? Did you like it? - It's... very big. - Isn't it just? I have lots of ideas for the decor, but I can't decide. So, I'm... Well, you know me. Well, bravo. Bravo. Bravo, bravo. Really. What you've done is incredible. You've... blown us all away. She sure did surprise us. Thanks. That's very kind of you. I never thought you had it in you. All this talent, all these projects, this success. Thank you, Karine. I didn't see it coming... I liked you so much when you were... when you were like us, when you were nothing. And I liked to protect my little L?a. I felt like your big sister. But now, frankly... I'm no use at all. What are you talking about? I don't think I've changed. I still want us to be friends. Francis says we all have our blind spots. Mine must be huge because when I read your books, I... I don't see what there is in them that touches millions of people. I'm sorry, I try. There must be something or no one would read them. But I don't get it. I guess... I must be a goddamn idiot. No, Karine, you're not. It doesn't matter if you didn't like my book. It's not important. You floored me, L?a. That's it, you won. What're you talking about? I've never competed with you. Okay, Francis, let's go. Well, aren't you staying for dinner? No, I want to go. - Karine... - Why? Because I can't do this. I can't keep on listening to your stories. Listen to all that's happening to you. No, it's too hard for me. - I just can't. - Karine... You had no right to change like that, without warning. Be careful of others. Be careful of others? Karine, I haven't changed. You've changed. I never tried to beat you. Well, stay in your blind spot. I can't help you. Come on, Francis. Karine... Francis... Karine, are you sure? I wish you all the best. Well, good evening. Look, don't blame Karine. Since you started writing, she can't see a thing, not even me. You took off like a rocket. We tried to do the same, but we blew up in flight. For the floating island, put the caramel on the egg whites. That's the secret. You were hard on her. No, she keeps provoking me. Of course, you don't see a thing. She didn't even try to stop me. My love, you've taken different paths. Move on. What do you care? "What do you care?" You don't care about anything! How on earth do I put up with you? That's not true. I do care about you and the children. Yes, I'm sorry. Okay? Forgive me. - Not too tired, kitten? - No, I'm okay. Thanks. Come on. Hello. Go on! You're the best! Keep it up! My love! You're the best, my Karine! You're the best! ...comes in at two hours 59 and 33 seconds. Whatever you do, smile because it's all over! Don't be ashamed to cry tears of joy, tears of victory. I want to do other races. I'm not surprised. You were incredible. Hang on. I can't believe your time. My first marathon, I'm only two hours 16 behind the world record. That's incredible! The lady in blue. L?a would laugh at that. Send her the photo. Oh, I don't know. I'll see. Maybe I was too hard on her. I guess I miss her. Well, I loved your latest book. - A gem. - Thank you. - You did it again. - Thanks. - Know what the next one's about? - Yes. You never stop! Can you tell us more? Yes, it's about two couples who are friends. Their relationship changes when one starts writing... Don't say too much, L?a. She was about to tell us! It's so modern. I can't wait. I'm not allowed to. Mrs. Monteil, may I ask you to sign our guest book? - Of course. - Thank you. The dessert menu! Chocolate melty for me. The matcha tea Napoleon, please. Thank you. - Alright. - Just a coffee. Nothing for me. No, nor me. I'm on a diet. Same here, thank you. So, a Napoleon, L?a? No. If no one is having dessert, I won't, either. - Want me to accompany you? - No. - Have a dessert. - No, thanks. No, really, I... I'm fine. Thank you. - More wine? - Oh, yes. Same again? We'll have the same again. - Well, to L?a. - To the next book. Cheers. Thank you.
