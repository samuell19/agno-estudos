- It was the folly of our summer that lead us to this place. To be as one in this world where... where chaos and violence ensues, we must... This opportunity... uh, this opportunity... we must... When it presents itself. And, uh, we must acknowledge this opportunity as a gateway to... - I need a new pencil. What is that? What is she doing? - I think she forgot her lines again. - Mindi, is there a problem? - I'm sorry, Vera. I know the line. I just lost my place. - Well, maybe you should spend a little less time doing interviews with teen magazines and a little more time rehearsing. - I'm sorry. - "Sorry" doesn't make it better. Everybody keep working! - Um... - Vera? Vera... - Ugh. - We have to talk. - Not now, Alan. No, no, right now, we need to talk, you see, because I was watching the rehearsal, and you took out key parts of my dialogue. - I took out parts that weren't working. - Now, look here, I write my plays very specifically. Every word has a meaning. Like what? - Well, like page eight. The character is supposed to say, "we may not get there, but at the very least, they'll know we tried." And you changed it to "at least." "At least...at least they'll know we tried." - You're joking. - No. No, I'm not. - Ugh, I don't have time for this, Alan. - No, you will make time! - Alan, please. - This is incredibly important... - oh! - Aah! Aah! - Oh! - Unh! - Oh, gosh. - You struck me. She struck me. You all saw it. - No, I didn't, but if you say it again, I will. - She's threatening me. - I'm fired? Leo... - I'm sorry, Vera, but if I don't give you the boot, I'll have the union on my back. Now, Alan has agreed not to file a legal action if I let you go. - I see. So you're caving in to threats. - Vera, you've been unhappy since we cast mindi in the play. - Because she can't act. - Be that as it may, I plan to sell a couple thousand mindi brace t-shirts in the lobby by January 1. And that more than makes up for the tender regret I feel about her acting talent. I have no choice. - Vera, this is the third job you've been fired from this year. - Well, you make it sound like four. - Good. That's good. Make jokes. - Can't you just get me another job? - Just like that? - You said, "Vera, I am very good at my job. "Leave it to me. Think of me as your older brother." Or did you say "uncle"? - I'll line up some jobs for you tomorrow. Bye. - Thank you, Carmen. I'll look at it later. - Thanks for meeting with me, Rebecca. - Oh, Vera, we had such a blast the last time we worked together. It's hard to believe that was over two years ago. - Well, I am very excited about your new season. - Uh, Vera, about that... I can't hire you. - I-I don't understand. - As a friend, I wanted to tell you this in person. People are saying terrible things about you. - What have I done that is so wrong? - It's not what you've done, dear. It's how you've done it. - Okay, so I can be a little abrasive. - Dictatorial. - Opinionated. - Insulting. - Every ship needs a strong captain. - Unless that captain steers that ship into sharp rocks. - Ugh. - You're a smart girl. You'll find your way back. - Yes, Alan, I have the contract right here. I will...i will mention the offer to my client, and as soon as I get an answer, I'll get back to you. Okay. Talk to you later. Bye. Good morning, Vera. - Why am I here? - Just sit down. - I don't want to sit down. I want a job. - And you got one. And it's a pretty solid offer. The ball's in your court. - Shut up. - Yeah, it's...i mean, it's an unusual job. - Details? - Well, it's a very small theater company upstate, and they're putting on a play. And they need a director. And it's a substantial check. - Well, I'll take it. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's more. - A job is a job. When do I start? - Right away, if you want to, but hear me out. Listen to me, okay? It's a small community company of players and they want to put on, uh, an annual... Christmas pageant. - Christmas pageant? - Christmas pageant. - No, no, no. I-I have directed Broadway. I have directed off-Broadway. I have directed off-off-off-off-Broadway. But this is crazy. Vera, it's a good job. The money is good. And besides, nobody else is interested in you. Call it career therapy, performance gestalt, chapter ten of your inevitable best-selling autobiography. But for the love of Mary Martin, take the job. It's just a few weeks. - All right, I'll do it. - There was another cab company in town. They went out of business. Now it's only me. Town's gearing up for the annual Christmas pageant. - So I've heard. - This year we're doing something really special, bringing in a real director from New York City. - Is that right? - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Hello, there. Lovely day. Hear ye, hear ye, city council meet-up this evening. - What is this... perky mchappy town? Uh, I can't stay here. Ooh! You must be Vera. Welcome! - Well, you picked a honey of a day to come see us. Look at that sunshine. - My goodness! - Oh. - What a smart outfit. Who would have thought to use all those colors all at the same time? Unique. That's what it is, unique. - Isn't she a bunch of peaches? - I don't know what you mean by that. Well, you will. You will. - Oh, come on, let's get you into the kitchen. You must be hungry... - Well... - and craving food. - Actually, I ate on the train, so I can... - no, now sit yourself down. Would you like a snickerdoodle? - No, no, I don't... thank you. - You're a chamomile girl, right? - Actually, I'm a pepp... - you sure about the snickerdoodle? - No, I don't want it. - So, tell us all about New York City. - Mm. - I'm gonna just check on my room and maybe freshen up. - Oh, it's the top of the stairs, room at the end of the hall. - I'll get your luggage. - Oh, no, I'll manage. - I'll save you a snickerdoodle. - Thanks. All right, to start, why don't you tell me your names and a little something about yourselves? - Well, uh, mayor Noah Humphrey, and I'm also president of the Ashton falls city players. - Pleasure to meet you, mayor. - Beverly Simmons, I love traditional Christmases. I don't see why a Christmas tree has to be anything other than traditional green with traditional white lights. - That's very informative. - Eddie Fleming. I'm Ashton falls' mail carrier. - Well, there's only one? - Why use two when one will do? - Well, I have an assistant. - Ah. - Sherry gumm, as in bubble gum. But with two "m"s. I'm actually a poet. But most people think of me as an arts-and-crafts dealer. - You write poetry? Are you published? - Oh, heavens, yes! I own my own business. It's called "it could be verse." - My goodness. - Well, you let me know if there's anything I can do to help you. - I will. - Because my time is your time. - Yes, thank you... Sherry. - Uh, Zach Wilson... I'm the editor of the Ashton falls dispatch. Um, perhaps, Ms. Parks, if you have time, maybe we could sit down for an interview. I promise a front-page story. - There's only one page. - And you are? - Uh, Anita...Corning. I have to go someplace. She's, um... She's a little shy. - Yeah, you think? - Yeah. - You know, I'll get to know the rest of you as we go along, but we really should start rehearsing, so... Where is the theater? - This is the theater. - Um, I know we're rehearsing here, but really, where is the theater? - Oh, those folding chairs are the seats, and that platform will become the stage right there. - Props, costumes... are there... Any? - Of course! Right this way. - Years worth. Come along. We'll show you. - Ta-da! - Oh. Why don't you tell me what you have in mind for the show? - Um, Ashton falls' pageant dates back to 1893, when president Grover Cleveland was scheduled to pass through Ashton falls the week before Christmas. The townsfolk put together a holiday pageant for him. - It was a shame, though. Uh, he ran behind schedule, so his train didn't actually stop. - Although they say he did wave to the good people of Ashton falls from the window. - And since the show must go on, they performed the pageant anyway, and they've been doing the same show ever since. - The...the same... Pageant since... 1893. - Oh, down to the last detail. - Oh, uh, so basically it's the nativity. - Is that a problem? - Nothing that can't be solved. - "Solved"? - Well, I'm the director that you hired. I'm gonna direct the pageant. - Well, I am sure there's business that we can all attend to. In which case, shall we call it a day and, uh, what, start fresh tomorrow morning? - I'm gonna take this home and... and, uh, study it in detail, and I think we should get back together tomorrow morning at, um, say, 9:00. 9:00. - Okay. If I didn't need the money so bad, I would be on a train so fast, it would make their heads spin. - I'm not sure this was such a great idea. - Now, Beverly, give her a chance. - Well, if she thinks she's gonna come here and start changing everything, she'll have me to deal with. I'm hungry. - What do you want to bet they haven't even heard of peppermint tea? Hi, there. You wouldn't by any chance... - Sam, that'll be one peppermint tea with honey. - Jack? Jack Harmon. - Surprise. What are you doing here? - This is home for ten years now. Please have a seat. - Right. Ooh. - Sorry. There's a... - Uh, wow. I-I can't believe it's you. Uh, how are you? - I'm good. Oh, thanks, Sam. Um, so I was right, peppermint tea with honey. - Yeah. Yep. Good memory. - Thanks. - I am sorry. I can't, uh, put this together. Jack Harmon, titan of industry... Working in a coffee shop. - Well, I'm actually the owner. And I also bake. Um, you look great. I haven't seen you since... - Since you broke up with me. - So I hear you're in town to direct the Christmas pageant. It's not going very well. - Why do you say that? - They just want to do the same show they've been doing for years. I don't know why they hired me. - Oh, um, the guy used to direct the pageant... he sold his hardware store, and he moved down south. - Well, I have no idea how they found me. - Well, I kind of recommended you. - I'm sorry. What? - I-I-I kind of recommended you. - You kind of recommended me. - Uh, I was thinking maybe we could go over there. - Hello? - I'm in doily hell, Peter. - Well, if it isn't miss Suzy sunshine. - I don't think this job is going to work out after all. - So you just, uh, want to throw away a perfectly good paycheck. Listen, Vera, you're there already. Do the job, and you come back to the city. We'll kick some butt, okay? - Things have gotten a little more complicated. When hasn't anything you've ever done become more complicated? - True. - Okay, I'll tell you what... you just don't make any rash decisions, and tomorrow morning you might wake up with a whole new lease on life, okay? - I doubt that. - Okay, baby. Bye. - Now, please, I've asked you all here this morning... thank you for coming... so that we can hash this thing out before our new director joins us. - I don't like her. - She's not going to change the pageant, Beverly. - Then why do we need her? - Please. - Well, attendance has been down the last few years. Maybe we need something new. - I think it's wonderful having someone from Broadway direct us. Who knows where this could lead? Why, this could spread the word about our pageant. We may end up on the pages of people magazine. - The point is, are we prepared to let this new yorker swoop down and ruin everything? - Beverly, she's not going to ruin everything. - How do you know that? - How do you know that she... - just give her a chance, Beverly. - Maybe none of you care, but I am gonna make it my business to keep an eye on Ms. Big city director. - What's up with her? - I don't know. - Hi, is this George? I need a taxi cab from the b&b to the train station, please. Right now. I'll be waiting out front. Okay. - Are you the lady from New York? - Yes, I am. - This is for you. Daisies are hard to come by this time of year. - Well, thank you very much. - You're very welcome. I'm Kristen. - Did you come here just to give me this flower, Kristen? - Actually, I have a question. - All right, so what is your question? - Well, I thought since you come from New York City, which is a big city with lots of people, you must know lots of things. - I guess so. - And you probably know if there's a real Santa Claus or not, right? I don't think people have been telling me the truth. I don't think Santa is something people should joke about. Do you? - No, I don't think people should joke about anything that serious. - So is there a Santa Claus? - Well... Here's the way I see it. At Christmastime, believing in things makes them real. That's how Christmas wishes come true. Does that make sense? - Oh, that's the perfect answer! - Oh! Oh, goodness. - I knew you'd know the answer. Thank you. - Sure. - Oh, and don't forget to put your Daisy in some water. - No, I-I-I won't. Thank you, Kristen. - Oh, hello, Vera. I'm just, uh, taking this, uh, package to send it to one of my daughters... lives out in new Mexico. That's way out west from here. You going somewhere? - Um, well, actually, i... - oh, yeah, I understand. - You do? - No, no, I... Believe me, I understand. I can see it in your eyes. Oh, I can... don't deny it. I can see it in your eyes. You know, whenever I'm scared, I do something that calms me down. You see? You can't be scared if you're...if you're whistling. Try it. - Oh, Garrett, I don't feel like whistling... - oh, no, no, I'm not gonna let you leave unless you try it. Go on now. Please? - Yes. - You see? See, now don't you feel better? Actually, it does. - Yeah, well, now, there you go. - All aboard for the train station. - Well, am I gonna say good-bye, or are you gonna stay and face your fear? - There will be other trains. - What exploded? - Oh, no, honey, that was just Garrett greeting the dawn. - Greeting the what? - Ahh, well, you two missed a honey of a sunrise. - Yeah. Garrett leans out a window every morning and bangs those cymbals together when the sun rises. - Why? Well, to celebrate. - Fine. Going back to sleep. - Aw, she's... - Got it? - Yeah, man. Easy. Hey, you know what? - So I thought we should have a table read, so I can get an idea of how the words flow. - We already know how the words flow. - How nice for you, Beverly. All right, let's start the table read. Uh, Eddie, it says here you usually play one of the three wise men. - Yeah, that's right. - Great, let's start with the monologue on the top of, uh, page three. - In the night... In the night sky... Uh... There came... in the night sky, there came a brilliant light... The light from a star... - I'm gonna stop you right there. You've played this role before? - Uh, four years now. - I think we're gonna go a different way this year. - I don't... I don't understand. - I think we need to go with a smoother presentation. - I-I can't be a wise man? - I think you should maybe just skip it, just for this year. - Did she just fire me? - I think so. - It's all right, Eddie. - We'll figure out casting later. Let's just begin with the narrator for speech, page four, Noah. - Ah. Of course. Mary's time was near. - I'm sorry, but there are no rooms available! If you like, you can stay in the stable with the cows and the sheep! I can be better. I can be less mean. - Let's talk about this scene for a minute. All right, we have a very pregnant woman and her loving husband, who is trying to find them a place to spend the night. Instead of doing it the same old way it's been done, let's do it in silhouette, with shadows. We'll cast giant images across this backdrop, right? Mary and Joseph are going from place to place. And they're getting turned away silently. The only sound the audience hears is their sad footsteps echoing throughout the theater. - What do you have against the baby Jesus? - What? - Well, you just seem to be stepping all over his holiday. I'm just trying to throw out ideas to freshen up this pageant. I mean, look, look at this thing, right? - No, no, no, no. - We don't need a tin-foil star. We can use a light to symbolize the light from the star and have it spill out over the entire audience. - You don't want to use our star? - Oh, well, I mean, look, it is kind of old, don't you think? - My mother told me that during world war ii, there was a metal shortage, and we had to make do with a construction-paper star. After v.E. Day, the very first roll of aluminum foil was delivered to the grocery store and carried here to this theater, so we could have the first truly shiny star in five years. - There was a flood in '88. Oh, what a mess that was. It left mold on almost everything except this star. It kind of makes you think, doesn't it? - I'm not...I'm not trying to change things just to change them. I mean, I have years of theater experience. - Let me save you a lot of time, Missy. - Now, you're free to lie in bed at night and imagine any show your little heart desires. But on this stage, in this auditorium, all we want is an Ashton falls players' Christmas pageant! - Hi, Vera. Remember me? - Of course I do. We're here to be fitted to play angels. - That...that's nice. - You look sad. - No, i'm... - are they giving you a hard time in there? - As a matter of fact, they are. - When kids are misbehaving, my teacher always let's us do the chores we like best. That way, everybody feels important. - You know, I think you're right. I can do that. - Of course. And you're welcome. - All right, girls. I'm ready for your fitting. - Got to go. - Thanks again. - Good luck with the pageant, Vera. - Eddie... Don't take another step. - Did I do something wrong? - Sometimes people have greatness thrust upon them. Today you are the "thrustee." - I am? - How would you like to be my assistant director? Oh, you bet. - Great. I'll need ten copies of that, collated and stapled, five sharpened number-two pencils, and a cup of hot peppermint tea with honey. I'm on it. I can do this. - The director's here. Eddie! - We're starting with the wise men scene. Got the new script right here. - Welcome back. - Great to be back. - Thanks, Eddie. - You're welcome. You're welcome. - Thanks. - No "problemo." - Noah... - Oh. - Go. - And lo, the three wise men gazed up at the night sky and beheld a most glorious sight. - Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. - Too fast? - No, no, no, no. - It was too slow. - No, no, nothing like that. It says in the script that you do this narration from offstage? - No, right. I mean, I always read this part, uh, from backstage. Mayor, you're a public figure. You're used to speaking in front of large groups of people, right? - Well, yes, of course. I mean, I make several speeches a year. - Why don't you do the narration from right there, just a little bit over on the stage, in front of the audience? - Really? Like my own special place? - Yeah, yeah, and maybe even your own baby spotlight and a little soft piano music in the background. - Could I wear a tuxedo? - I don't see why not. - Oh, I think I just had a chill down my leg. - Now, hang on. The narrator is never seen by the audience. - Oh, Beverly, it's really such a small change, and it feels so right to me. - I never met a politician that didn't mind being on a microphone. - I don't know, Beverly. I kind of like it. - Yeah. - Me too. It feels fresh and new. - Good. - That's two-to-one for. - Then let's try it this way. - Yes. - Thank you. - Stage right a little. That way, that way, okay. - And lo, the three wise men gazed up at the night sky and beheld a most glorious sight. - More pie, dear? - Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No more room. - I'm so sorry. You're welcome, dear. - Hey, we better get moving. It's almost time for the bake. - Oh, yes. - I hope you're talking about getting a suntan. Oh, goodness, no. He means the annual Christmas cake and cookie bake. Everyone in Ashton falls pitches in to make the... oh, the most delicious goodies for tree-lighting night on Wednesday. - That's the first official day of Christmas season. - Oh, would you like to come? Oh, wouldn't you, dear? I'm sure you'd like to show off your baking skills. Wouldn't you, dear? - Maybe next time. - Well, there won't be another time until next year, young lady. - And it's good for the public relations for the pageant... And that crew you're working with. - Hmm? - Hmm? - Ugh. - It smells just like la patisserie. Honey... We're in a church. Watch your language. - Oh, no, no. That's the name of my favorite bakery in Paris. I-I... I'll just watch my language. - Garrett, Ethel! - Well, hello. Hello, Noah. Now, you just make yourself at home. - Happiest of happys. Thank you. Thank you. - Greetings, greetings. - Hi, Vera. Punch? - Oh, no, thanks. - Oh, thank you very much. - Oh, hey, boss. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, Kristen. - Are you gonna help us bake a cake? - Well, don't tell anybody, but I'm not very good at this sort of thing. - Don't worry. I'll teach you. - Okay. - Just take the flour and put it in here. - Put this thing... - yes. - Okay. In there. - Yes. - Like that, okay. - Perfect. - Another? - Just one more. - Just one more, okay. All right, now... - now, take the mixer... - Mm-hmm. - And mix it up. - Oh, hey. This is not as hard as I thought it would be. - And you're not so bad. - Well, thank you, young lady. - You're welcome. - Hey. - Look, daddy, we're making a cake. - "Daddy"? - Oh, oh! - Ooh, careful. - I'm gonna go get cleaned up right now. Aah! - Ooh. - I am so sorry. Oh, my gosh. You think this is funny? - You look like a melting candle. - Yes, I do. - You look, um...we should go and find the kitchen and get you cleaned up. - Okay. - Aw. They make such a snazzy couple. - Oh, now, Ethel, don't start. - Aw, it's so cute. - And when do I get to meet her mother? - Hey, Kristen, why don't you go see if they need help decorating? - But... - go. - Ugh. Whenever I get sent out of the room, I miss all the good stuff. - I heard that you had gotten married. - Yeah, after you and I ended our engagement, I kind of drifted for a while. Then I got married to Liz. She was a broker at the firm. - You jumped into that relationship rather quickly, didn't you? - Vera... You and I were always so consumed with our careers that... - isn't that what young people in New York are supposed to do? - Sometimes I think we forgot what was really important. - Like? - Like us, for example. - Well, I don't know...i thought we were pretty good together, right up until you left me. Why did you leave? - Well, I... Remember when we were supposed to go to Paris on vacation? - We talked about that, like, a thousand times. - You knew how important that job was to my career. - I know that, but we planned that trip for over a year. And after all the missed dinners and the arguments over schedules, I... It was kind of the last straw for me. - Well, I hope you and Liz are happy. - Vera... Liz passed away a few years ago. - I am so sorry. - No, it's all right. You know, I thought about, um, selling the place and going back to the city, but you know how it is. You get a little bit older, and it's hard to leave a place that starts to feel like home. - Mm, yeah, t-that's a feeling that I can't quite relate to. - Well, you're too busy slaying dragons all the time. - Something like that, yeah. - Oh, Vera, I am... - I have to hit the hay early. I have a really big day tomorrow with my cast and crew. - Oh, right. Well, good luck with that... or break a leg. - Mm. - Well, listen, um, you know, the folks in this town they kind of come across a little old-fashioned, but they're really great people. They'd give you the shirt off their back. - Well, I'll remember that in case I need a shirt. Well, maybe I'll, um... I'll just come by the coffee shop for another cup of tea. - I'd like that. Oh, these always go over real big with the audience. - I don't know, Eddie. It's kind of old and dated. - I thought they were supposed to be old and dated. - You know, they can be correct for the period and still be fresh, with different patterns, new fabrics, colors. I'm gonna meet with Anita about that. Remind me, will you? Now, show me the next... Okay, and bring it downstage, downstage, down... And stage right. - Okay, right here? - A little bit more... Okay, put it there. - Unh... - What do you think? - Uh... It...it's different from last year? - Good job. Just Mark it and just take it off the stage. Lighting. Mm... Mm-mm. Mm-mm. No, that's too bold. Let's try the other one. Oh, I like that. Yeah, all right, so it's the blue for the overhead, the golden yellow for the baby spot on the manger, and the mellow red for the wise men's entrance. Am I going too fast, Eddie? No, I'm getting it all. - You know, I'm still thinking about doing that one scene in harsh silhouette. - Oh... That'll really raise a hackle on Beverly. - There's only one director on this show. - All right, everyone, thank you, thank you all for agreeing to be judges in the holiday lights display contest. And a special thank-you to our visiting pageant director, Vera parks, for graciously giving us her time. - Oh, honey, you're gonna catch cold without a hat. - Oh, that's all right. I'm not really much of a hat... - oh, here, I brought an extra. I knitted it myself. Isn't it a beaut? - It... - aw. - I'm speechless. - I have matching mittens here. - No, that's fine... I'll just put my hands in my pockets but thank...thank you. - Aw, you're welcome. - Now, you all have a list of participating homes. Just be sure to stroll through town at your leisure and be sure to be back here, shall we say... Yes, 8:00. And there will be hot cocoa waiting for everyone in the city hall lobby. - You did it last year. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. I've never done it, I've never done it. Are you lost? No. But I am confused. I'm supposed to be judging this Christmas lights contest, but this house has just one candle in a window. - Oh. That's Beverly's house. I'm surprised...she usually goes all-out for the contest. - That is Beverly's house. - Yeah. I'm surprised to see it so bare. Maybe she's busy this year. - Yeah, she's busy giving me a hard time. - Ooh. Ah, she's all bark and no bite. You know, she hasn't been herself lately. Can I walk you to the next house? - I would appreciate that. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. - All right. - Okay, here's the pageant performance schedule. I thought you might like to look it over and check for mistakes. - I am sure there are no mistakes. You are doing a very good job, Eddie. - Oh, thank you. - Mm-hmm. - I got to go check on the manger and let everyone know what time to be here tomorrow. - Great. - Oh-ho! Great outfit, Noah. Running for re-election? - Thank you. Ta-da! What do you think? - I like it. But, you know, I think the hat might be a bit too much. - Do you? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, really? You think so? - Yeah. But... A red Rose on the lapel would be perfect. - Well, then... A red Rose on the lapel it is. - ♪ Hark, the herald angels sing ♪ ♪ glory to the newborn king ♪ Peace on earth ♪ and mercy mild ♪ god and sinners reconciled ♪ joy for all ye... I didn't know anyone was here. - Don't stop singing. - I wasn't really singing. - No, you were. And it was wonderful. - Um... I have to finish sewing these costumes. - Anita, your voice... it's so pure. Wouldn't it be nice to just share it with everyone? - Uh, I... I really can't do that. - I know how scary it can be to get up and sing in front of people. But we really could use your voice in the pageant. - Excuse me. I have to finish this work. - Daddy, do you miss mommy? - Yes, I do. - Me too. - I know you do, sweetie. - I think about her at breakfast and at night and on the playground. - You know that's okay. When we miss someone who's not here, we keep their memory alive in our hearts. - That's right. But what if you meet a lady someday and you like her a lot? Would that be a bad thing? - No. It's natural to want to be with someone. - And if you like someone that doesn't mean you stop loving mommy? - Of course not. She'll always be your mommy. And I'll always love her. Those things don't end just because she's not here. - That's what I thought. - Well, you thought right. I love you. - I love you. Want to hopscotch all the way home? - Well, I don't know about all the way home. Want to see how far we can get? - Okay. - Okay. Oh, I'm too old for this. - You have a visitor, Vera. I have some chores to do upstairs. - This is for you. Bye. I hope you can come. "Dear Vera, can you please come to my house for tea? "There will be food, too. "Also, honey will be available. "Give me ten minutes to set the table "and then come to my house for tea. "I hope you like tea. "Sincerely, Kristen. P.s., I hope you are having a nice day." You came! - Of course. - Come in. May I take your coat? - Yes, you may. - Beautiful weather, don't you think? - Yes, it is. - We haven't finished decorating for Christmas yet. You can sit here. - All right. Wha...Kristen, aren't you gonna join me? Oh. - Apparently that's my chair. - I see. - I promise you I had nothing to do with this. - And yet you've managed to get dressed... Or some semblance thereof. - Oh, well, Kristen picked out my ensemble. - Well, she has a unique eye. - Uh-huh. She does. - Who wants appetizers? - Mm. - And your tea. I will be in the kitchen minding my own business. Oh, I almost forgot. - ♪ Oh, Christmas tree - Christmas music. - Oh. - Very nice. - Nice. My daughter has big ideas. - Well, I think it's adorable. - Hmm, you must really rate highly with her, because I usually get plain oyster crackers and you got her peanut butter ones. - Dad, I'm sure glad you brought Vera to town. - Did... Did she just say "brought," because you told me that you kind of recommended me. - Yeah, well... Don't be angry with me. - No. I'm confused. I'm gonna...I'm gonna save angry for later, though. Okay. Well, the theater company needed a director, and they couldn't afford to bring one in. And I've been kind of following your career. Boy... And I, um, knew that you needed a job, so I sort of offered to pay for your salary. - I don't need charity. - I know. I'm sorry. It wasn't honest. I don't...you know, uh... The truth is, I just really wanted to see you. - Pfft. Well, now I don't know whether to be angry or flattered. - You know, I was afraid if I just picked up the phone and called you that you'd just say no. - So you tricked me. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - You know what? I'm sorry. It was dumb. It was really stupid. And, um... I don't know what to say. - It's okay. Truth is, I needed the job. And though the pageant is no resume booster... This is a nice place to spend December. - So you're not angry with me? - Wha...anger? What anger? - Anger. - No anger. Anger just breeds revenge, you know? And revenge sort of... - what are you doing? - It just rears its... - What are you doing with the cracker? - Ugly head. - Put the...put the cracker... Vera, don't throw that. - And sometimes... - No, you're not... - you just find revenge staring you right in the face! Oh, do you surrender? - Oh, absolutely. My daughter is probably watching us. - Oh... - Um... This is good. - Oh, hello, dear. Did you have a nice day? - I did. Ethel, may I ask you for some advice? - Of course. - It's about... - is it about a boy? - Well, a man. I mean... you know what I mean. - Come here. - You know, it can be hard to know what to feel when you haven't felt anything in a while. - Oh, that's exactly right. How did you know? Raise four girls, stay married for 43 years... You pick up a thing or two. - I just...i don't want to let my guard down. I'm only here for a few weeks. I really don't want a relationship. - You can't think your way out of it, Vera. You have to feel your way through. You may be upset because your heart's telling you something your mind doesn't want to hear. - You and Garrett seem so happy. How do you do it? - Oh, we have our moments. Every couple does. But the difference is that we're not working on something on the outside, we agreed to do this together, come what may. And I'll tell you something. It may be fun to climb a mountain all by yourself. But when you get to the top... It's so much nicer to share that view with someone you love. - Thank you. - Anytime, dear. - ♪ La la la la la la la la ♪ Good evening, ladies! What are you two conspiring about? - Uh... Mountain climbing. - Mountain...? - Climbing. - Mm. - Huh? - Vera, can I talk to you? - Hi, Beverly. - What is going on? - What do you mean? - Well, this angel costume has no halo. - Oh, yeah, that, well... - angels need halos... wings and halos, halos and wings. They go together like bread and butter. - Yes, I know that, but we tried using the halos, and they kept drooping down, so I decided to use a really nice lighting effect... - no! - Excuse me? - Angels have halos! Why did you have to come here and change everything? - I'm not trying to change everything. I'm just throwing out ideas to freshen things up. That's all. - Okay, first you tried to get rid of the aluminum star. Then you tried to fire Eddie. And then you said, "let's do the scene at the inn in shadow." Now you're trying to tell me that angels don't need halos. Well, let me tell you something. Angels need halos, or else they're just a bunch of toddlers in chiffon. - Listen, Beverly, it's obvious that you don't want me here, but I am here, and I am the director, and in my job as the director, I will make whatever decisions I have to make regardless of whether you like them or not. Got it? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a job to do. - Welcome, welcome all to the annual Ashton falls tree-lighting ceremony. Mm, and afterwards we can all taste those cakes and cookies at city hall. - Yum! - Aw! - Now, before we begin and throw the switch, I would like to say a few words. - Oh? Well, there's nothing surprising about that. It's true! - No long-winded speeches, I promise, it's just... Well, this holiday season we have with us a very special guest, and I wonder if you all would mind if we let Vera parks throw the switch. - Oh, what a good idea. - Oh, that's nice. - No. No, no, no. It's your ceremony. - Nonsense, Vera, please. You're one of us now. - Go on now. - Come on. - All right. - Ms. Gumm? - But...Kristen, will you help me? - Yes, please. - Aw. - Okay, let's do it. - All right. - Three, two, one... Go! - Let the season of goodwill begin. - I love christmastime. Everybody's so nice to each other. I wish it can always be like that. Hear, hear. - ♪ Hmm, we wish you ♪ a merry Christmas ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ and a happy new year ♪ good tidings we bring ♪ to you and your kin ♪ good tidings for Christmas ♪ and a happy new year - Morning, Vera. - Morning, boss. - I just love poinsettias... Real or not. - Where is Beverly? - Oh, she called. Uh, won't be coming. She sounded out of sorts. - Oh, Beverly... I thought maybe we could talk to see if there's a way... - Vera... - What's wrong? - They did some tests. - What do you... what do you mean? - A few weeks ago, I had my annual physical, and they found something, and, uh, I had to go in for a biopsy. - Oh, no. - And now i'm in the waiting game, and it's driving me crazy. - Oh, I am so sorry you have to go through all of this. - Hello. - Hi. - Peppermint tea with honey coming up. - Actually, I was hoping you might be able to come with me. - Yeah, is everything okay? - Yeah, I just need your opinion about something. - Sure, no problem. Hey, Sam, will you mind the store? Cool. What's up? - Oh, you're gonna have to wait and see. Ooh, sounds mysterious. Now, no peeking. Oh, wait. Okay. - If you're going to mug me, I don't carry much cash, so... - Well, that is a good thing, because you don't need money here in Paris. - Paris? - You can look now. - You sure? - Mm-hmm. Voila. - I figured I owed you a picnic in Paris, at the very least. - Did you make all this? - Well, Ethel put it together, but I was standing there the whole time offering lots of encouragement. - Ooh. Well, here's better late than never. - Mm. - A votre sante. - I will drink to that. - Mmm. - Mmm. Actually, I am. And you were right. The people here are really nice, and they've been so supportive, and I am having fun directing the pageant. I'm having a blast. - Wow. You know, I don't think I've ever heard you talk about a job like that, even back in the day, never. - Well, I love directing. I just think I've been doing it for all the wrong reasons. - Well, maybe you need a change. - You mean... Move here? - Why not? You'd be guaranteed a job every December, and you already know the guy that makes the best pot of tea in town... Me. - Beverly... - Thank you for coming. I'm sorry to bother you, but the doctor is supposed to call any minute. You want me to answer that? - No, I'll do it. - Beverly, the phone. - Hello? Yes. I see. Fine. See you then. - So? - I'm fine. - Wha...what? - The biopsy was negative. I'm as healthy as a horse. Whoo! - I am gonna decorate this whole place until I pass out! Whoo! - Good afternoon. Beautiful day. - Hi, Vera. - Hello. Happy almost Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Now, remember, a kris kringle gift isn't about the money you spend. It's about the thought that goes behind it. I have created this handy list alphabetized and by category of some gifts you might like to consider. - All right, everybody, we are getting very close to the big night. So, first thing tomorrow, we're gonna run through the entire show from beginning to end to get a sense of the timing. - Hey! You heard our director. This is gonna be the best pageant ever. It's true. - Okay, crew, make sure you go over that checklist that I gave you for tomorrow, okay? Hey, I got Noah! But, I... - Knock, knock. - Oh. Hi, Vera. - Can I bother you for a minute? Wow. Oh, that is really nice. - It's nothing, really. - Oh, that's what you think. You know, in New York, you could charge an arm and a leg for that kind of work. - Really? - Oh, yeah. You have no idea. People think it's just stitch work. They have no idea what it takes to pull it all together. - Actually, that's true. You have to think of the feel of the fabric and the sway of the cloth. - Could you teach me? - You want me to teach you? - How could I go wrong learning from an expert? - I... Yes, that would be fine. - Great. - It's actually pretty easy. - About the pageant... Anita, i... - I'll do it. - Excuse me? - I'll sing! - All right, keep breathing. Keep breathing. There. It's very brave of you to get up on the stage like this. - I can't do this. My nerves are killing me. - Use them. Nerves are good. Everybody gets stage fright. - Even you? - I had a teacher who once said that the day you stop having stage fright, quit. - But all the people will be out there. - Don't see them. - How? - Close your eyes. Okay. And tell me what you see. - Nothing. - Now just imagine that you're at home, all alone, and you're singing. - ♪ Silent night ♪ holy night ♪ all is calm ♪ all is bright ♪ round yon virgin ♪ mother and child ♪ holy infant ♪ so tender and mild ♪ sleep ♪ in heavenly peace ♪ sleep ♪ in heavenly peace I did it. - Yep, you did it. - Thank you. - Hello? - Hello. Are you sitting down? - Oh, better than that. I am laying down. - Well, I have news. I have big news. I have life-changing news. - All right, Peter, stop pacing in your office and tell me. - I just booked you a gig. You're going to direct a new, hot off-Broadway show. - Say that again. - The play that you were fired from folded. So a new producer came in to that same theater with a new play. I pitched you and he bought it. - Uh, wait, and nobody cringed? - Yeah, and get this. They've already cast frank Baldwin. - Wha...Oscar-winner frank Baldwin? Who hasn't done a play in 30 years. That's huge. - I know, I know, I know. - Oh, my god, this is amazing. - I know, and this thing is already going 100 miles an hour and they want to see you there first thing Monday morning. - Wait, Monday... in two days? - Yup, that's okay. You just get your butt on the first train out of mayberry and I'll meet you for lunch at the diner on 58th street, okay? I got to run, bye-bye. I can do this. Ahem. I'll just tell them straight out. They'll wish me luck, I'll leave for New York, simple. - But you can't go. - We need you. - The pageant is in great shape. You all have worked so hard. It's all you. It's not me. - No, it's your pageant too. You've worked so hard. - And you should be there to share it with us. - We want you to stay. I want you to stay. - Vera, I can't do it without you. - Uh... It breaks my heart to leave. It does. But opportunities like this don't just come along for a director. I mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime... - hi. What's going on? Why is everybody so glum? - Vera is going to New York. - What? - I was gonna talk to you... - you're leaving? Before Christmas? - Honey... When you're a grown-up, you'll understand. - No, I'll never understand. - Uh...jack? All right, I have to go pack. And the pageant is gonna be really good because you've worked really hard. And I wish I could stay but I have to go. - They look beautiful. - Thank you. - Well, we're gonna miss you, Vera. - I'll miss you too. - Uh, I was gonna give you this for Christmas but, uh, since you're leaving and all, um... Uh, this was on your nightstand and, uh, I saw it was wilting so I pressed it and had it framed. It's just a little somethin', you know. - Thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. - Well, you mean a... You mean a lot to, uh, all of us. Ahem. Uh, well, now I better get after that hot water heater. - Aren't you gonna say goodbye? Not even a "see you later?" Kristen, honey... I love... Directing. And this job is gonna give me a chance to do what I love. - I thought that's what you were doing here. - Well, it is. - Then why do you need an even bigger job? So you can love it even more? - No. - Then you're not making any sense and I don't want to talk to you anymore. - Kristen, please don't leave like this. I'm not hugging you good-bye. I'm just hugging you because I feel like it. - Jack, I'm torn. I mean, this really is a very important job. But i... - I know. You have another dragon to slay in New York. Good luck. Come on, honey. Are you looking forward to school after the new year? - Yeah, I guess. Sort of. - What do you mean, "sort of?" I thought you liked school. - You think I'll ever see Vera again? - I don't know, honey. - I hope so. - Well, sometimes our hopes let us down. - Then I wish... I make it my big Christmas wish. - You really liked the show? I don't know. - Yeah. - Come on, everybody, don't be so down. - I don't think I can sing without Vera. - Sure you can. - I feel the same, she gave me the confidence to be a great assistant director. And without her, I feel like I can only be a mediocre assistant director. - Eddie, people! We've been through floods and wars and depressions... - it's just not the same. - I don't know what to do. - I know what I'm gonna do. - All right, that was great, but I wanted to do it again. I want you to keep the intensity, but do it a little slower. Especially after the phone call. - No, we cannot try that scene again! Just tell me what you're looking for and I'll give it to you, but this endless nitpicking has got to stop! - Let me tell you something. You... Look... What I'm trying to do is just to help you find an easier pathway for your character through the scene. - Don't lecture me, young lady. In case you haven't noticed, I'm the big fish in this pond. - Wha...? Oh. I'm sorry. Everybody take ten. - What'd I miss? - Ugh! - What are you doing here? - We're here to ask you to come back with us. - We need you, Vera. - Please come back. - I can't do it by myself, Vera. - Oh... - You said at christmastime believing in things makes them real. Remember? - I remember. - I believe you're gonna come back and share the Christmas pageant with us. - Honey, it doesn't work that way. - You said it did. - I know. - And I believed you. - Sometimes, grown-ups don't... - can we please get rid of these tourists and get on with the rehearsal? - They are not tourists! They happen to be friends of mine! - We don't have time for you to make chit-chat with aunt Joan from St. Louis! Where are you going? Are you going to direct this play or not? - Not. I quit. - Ah! - Yes! - I knew she would! - Yaay! - She quit. No one quits on me. - Hey, Ethel. - Hiya. - Is my date ready? - Oh, I believe so. Vera! Your gentleman caller is here. - Wow, you look beautiful. - Thank you. - Can I escort you to the Christmas pageant? - I thought you'd never ask. - Garrett? We're gonna be late. - Coming. I am coming. Ah, excuse me. Madame. - Yes, dear. Thank you. - Ready to go. Now. - I can't believe that. Hm. - Welcome to the Ashton falls Christmas pageant. Directed by Vera parks. And assisted by Eddie Fleming. - All right, Eddie! - Ladies and gentlemen... Sherry gumm. - Ahem. Sing me a song of Christmas past. Of golden memories that last, of shining stars that lit the way. Of love we shared on Christmas day. Grant every child's wish without delay. Christmas comes but once a year. It is our job to continue the joy and cheer. - I'm sorry, but there are no rooms available. If you'd like you can stay in the stable with the cows and the sheep. What are they doing? That wasn't in the script. - Shh, just watch. - All right. - Oh, it's beautiful. - Eddie came up with that idea. - He did? - Yeah, he said he learned it from you. - That's great! That was great! - And now, in her very first public performance, miss Anita corning. - Vera... This song's for you. - ♪ Ave Maria ♪ maiden mild ♪ listen to a maiden's prayer ♪ ♪ for thou canst hear from the wild ♪ ♪ tis thou ♪ canst save amid despair ♪ amid despair ♪ ave Maria - Oh, you make a beautiful angel, Kristen. - Thanks. And I wish I could sing like you, miss Anita. - Oh, thank you, Kristen. - Come on, let's go. - You were so good. - I was so nervous but I just used my nerves, just like you told me. - Well, the performances were all just spectacular. Sherry, your poem was amazing. And Eddie, oh, that scene, it was wonderful. - Well, you taught me everything I know, Vera. - Well, I couldn't be more proud. The whole pageant was just...it was beautiful. - I picked your name out of the basket. - Oh! - Oh. - Oh. - Oh, I love it. - I have a bone to pick with you. - Oh. - What now? - Where's my Christmas hug? - Jack... I picked your name but I forgot to get you a gift. - That's okay. Jack harmon... I love you. - I love you too. - It looks like Christmas wishes do come true. - I knew it would work out. - Oh, now, Ethel.
