I, Isadora Duncan, hereby vow, on my 12th birthday, that I will dedicate myself to the pursuit of art and beauty, and to this single life. I will never marry. I will never submit myself to any claims other than those of truth and beauty. To seal this vow, I hereby solemnly burn my parents' marriage certificate. "Beauty is truth, truth beauty." That is all we know on earth, "and all we need to know." My first idea of movement of the dance came from the rhythm of the waves. And my first understanding of music, from the sighing of the winds in the giant redwoods, for I was born by the sea, and all the great events of my life have taken place by the sea. I was born under the star of Aphrodite, goddess of Love. Blackbird, blackbird, gotta be on my way. Where there's sunshine galore. - Pack up all my cares and woes... - Are we working? - Or are we having a little sing-song? - Here I go, singing low. Bye, bye, blackbird. Where somebody waits for me sugar's sweet, so is he. Bye, bye, blackbird. Oh, very jazzy, dear, now can we get on? Well, all right, where was I? "Born under the star of Aphrodite." I was born under the star of Aphrodite, goddess of Love. Who was also born on the sea. - In the sea? - "on" sounds less peculiar. Oh fuh, it all sounds peculiar. I am trying to write the truth about myself, but it all comes out nightingales and roses. Come on, come on, we can make it into great literature later, but let's just get the 1,000 words done, shall we? We haven't done yesterday's yet, or the day before's. - Roger, you've been drinking water again. - No, darling, I've just been reading - your bank statements, that's all. - Roger, dear, I will never have the pen of Sir Walter Scott. I'm only a poor dancer. And all I know about is dancing. Come on, come on, get some pep in it. Okay, okay, that's enough! Who's next? Shall I dance my Chopin waltz for you? You could be a nice little kicker if you put your heart into it. You've got nice legs, very nice legs. Come back when you learn how to use 'em. Let's go... come on, come on, come on! You look great, honey, you look great... Now remember: No kicks, no lectures, and no Greek stuff. I'll do exactly what you want, Mr. Sullivan, but if they like me, you pay. You know the terms honey: Contract dependent on attractability. Now remember: Pep! Pep. I want $20 a night for three weeks, that's $300. I'll give you $100. See, you've gotta give me $300. I'm taking my whole family to Europe. - $200. - No, it's a big family. - $200. - Not enough! Okay, okay, $250, but that's tops! Now, go on out there, honey, and give a nice peppy encore. Am I getting my $300? - $250, and that is the limit. - Do I get my $300, or don't I? - $250! - The $300. $250, and that's the limit... play the encore! Breaking his promise! Listen, I'm a poor working girl, I have a starving family to support. - He won't pay me! - Give her that dough, you rat. - Shut up! - Give her that dough, ya... - Give her that dough, ya bum. - All right, all right! $300. Listen, honey, I've got a great idea. Now, you do your Greek stuff first, and then change to the kicks and the frills. - It'll make... it'll make an interesting turn. - Please, Mr. Sullivan, you don't realize. You just paid the whole sea passage for me and my entire family to Europe. - You are an agent of my fate. - Well, honey, $300's only the beginning! You got attractability! You'll make your fortune here! It's not my fortune I'm after, it's my destiny. Roger, come out here, I need you. What? - What is it? - Quickly, quickly, quickly. - Who is that man? - Which man? That one with the goggles. - Well, how should I know? - Well, I thought you knew everybody around here. - How can we find out? - Is it important? - Very, he's beautiful. - He's a bit lonely. Come on, come on, we're supposed to be working. I want to meet him. - He's a young Adonis. - Adonis? - He's probably somebody's chauffeur. - Don't be such a little snob. Well, don't you be so extravagant. I have an extravagant nature, surely you've discovered that about me by now. Watch where you're going, you stupid gredo! - That was him... that was him! - Are you all right? - Who? - My Adonis of the terrace. Raving maniac! Oh, poor Roger, did he make a horrible mess of your memoirs? Your mem... they're your memoirs, not mine. What kind of a car was it, do you know? Well, how should I know? I'm not a chauffeur. A Bugatti, or something, I think. A Bugatti, what a beautiful name! - You think he's Italian? - I shouldn't be in the least surprised the way he drives... bloody nearly killed us. Oh fuh, one never dies before one's time, didn't you know? I don't find that much of a comfort, thank you very much. Oh, but it is, it is... after all, he missed us, didn't he? Perhaps it's an omen... He's a messenger from the gods. In 32 days, we should be in England. Think of it, think of it! Stand still for a moment, and let that thought enchant you. If Raymond doesn't help with packing, we're gonna miss that boat, and we won't get there for 32 years. "I flew too gentle airs to ease our tasks." It is Raymond who's really working, mother... He keeps beauty before us every single second of the day. "Therefore, ye gentle pipes, play on." Do you really think we're going to need all these blankets? How on earth are we going to carry them all? We need them for the boat to keep warm. We shall have to learn Spartan ways, and find comfort from the words of the poets and the philosophers. If we're going to be freezing in gearage, we might as well have our blankets. Oh, we have to be hard, as Nietzsche teaches us. "Be hard, and strive for the infamous." "There lies Europe, open to the fields and to the sky, waiting to be ravished." London, Paris, Berlin, Florence, Athens. We shall storm your museums as the Parisians stormed the Bastille! We shall bring back to America the Grecian arts that have been lost! We shall ignite the flame! Raymond, Raymond! Magnificent. "The isles of Greece," the isles of Greece, where burning Sappho loved and sung, "where grew the arts of war and peace." - Ideally, of course, I do need a bigger space. - I think you deserve some champagne. I'd rather some milk, if you have it. An amphitheater, for instance, like the Greeks. It is the most democratic form of theater, you know? - Everyone has an equal view. - Well, I don't think I can quite offer that, but I would be most happy to welcome you to my home. Oh wonderful... well, you'd have to take the whole program. There's Elizabeth, Raymond, and my mother always plays the piano. I'm only the lead, and the business manager. Naturally, the whole ensemble. "Has bowed down before Agnes... the free spirit..." Do you suppose you could build us an amphitheater? Oh, I... One person that, in the whole of London, that the Duncan family will be eternally grateful to is Mrs. Patrick Campbell. - We met in such a funny way. - And in all London streets, people stare at my garments in amazement, but I don't wish to play, yet I merely wish to... Raymond and I were dancing in Kensington Square, and Raymond was playing his flute, and I was dancing among the dry leaves. And suddenly, this beautiful woman came up to us in black furs, and she said, "Where on earth have you two come from?" And I said, "Oh, we're not from earth at all", we come from the moon." Tell me, Miss Duncan! I'm fascinated... When did you first learn to dance? Oh, I never learned at all, I danced in my mother's womb. - How extravagant. - Oh, it was. You see, my father had just left us... He was a remarkable man, but unreliable... and that increased my mother's agony. All she could eat was oysters and champagne, the food of Aphrodite, and so naturally I danced right from my conception. You're speaking metaphorically, of course. No, I'm speaking of my destiny. Roger. What? Come here. - What is it? - Come here. Oh, dear. You're having one of your moods again, are you? Does Mary like me, do you think? Well, of course, she does. - She's devoted to you. - She never wants me to do things. - Well, what things? - Oh. Come on, lie down beside me. No, I can't, I'll crease my suit. Well, take it off then, come on. There. That's better, isn't it? And what things won't she let you do? Well, dancing, for one thing... She doesn't want me to dance. She's always trying to get you to do a concert. Oh, do relax, for heaven's sake, it's like trying to hug an ironing board. Well, I'm not comfortable, that's why. Oh, poor little Roger. Oh, the kettle's boiling. But, it's true: Whenever we get to the point when a concert might actually happen... - She's trying to protect me! - Protect you? I know, I'm old and fat, and... - Here we go. - It's true... you think I don't know? I will never dance again. "The gods give, the gods take away." Isadora, you're not old, and you're not fat! Yes, I am, I'm old and fat! - I'm ridiculous. - You want a nice hot cup of tea? You don't understand... you're a cruel boy. Look, do you want the cup of tea or don't you? Pour me some brandy. Tea's much better for you. Oh, a lot of things that are much better for most people are deadly poison for me, and a nice cup of tea is one of them. I still have nice arms, don't I? Yes, you have. I may be a stupid old nuisance, but I still have beautiful arms. Arms are the last of a woman's glories to fade, you know? Bravo! Grazie! Isadora! Dora! Mary! Mary! Mary! Oh! I've got a check! Come on, pack your bags, we're going to Paris! What are we going to Paris for? Who cares? Just think: Paris at dawn! Didn't I tell you not to worry? This check came direct from the treasure house of the gods. - Onward to Paris. - What about paying your hotel bill? Why ever should I do that? Never spend good money on bad debts. Let the past take care of itself. "Onward, onward, ever onward!" Please tell him. Tell him to go faster, tell him to go faster! What is it? Please tell me. I can help you... stop the car! No! What is it, Isadora? What is it? I don't like those tunnels, I don't like them. But, we're out now, we're in the light. We're on the open road. We're going to Paris! Yes... yes. We're going to Paris. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. It's him! Mary, it's him! Stop! Stop! Stop! Oh my God! Now I shall never see him and I must. Well, let's see if they know anything about him at the restaurant. - Oh, do you think they will? - Come on. How smart you are... I would never have thought of that in a hundred years. Patron! Patron! Darling Isadora! - Oh, Archer. - How beautiful you look today. - Today? - Mary... particularly so today. That's because I'm rich and I'm in love. We're in pursuit of the most beautiful young man. Oh, has he been here? Oh, did you see him? He left a little while ago... he's divine. No, I'd like to have met him... Perhaps another time, pity. I've got Martin Bedford with me... I'll have him join us. - Oh, is he an artist? - A spark of England. - Is he brilliant? - Promising, and very rich. Oh. How do you do, Ms. Duncan? - I do perfectly. - I'd always hoped to meet you one day. My mother saw you dance once in London. Go on. Did she adore me? - Was it a turning point in her life? - No, I don't think so. Then, I really can't see why you mention it. Well, you're a legend, aren't you? A legend in your own lifetime. "A legend in my own lifetime." I have just been reduced to the most ghastly cliché. - How's the new book coming along, Archer? - Oh, I never know. I'm filling the pages. Oh, the new modesty, it comes in like a lamb. Will it go out like a lion? Oh, Ms. Duncan, do we all have to be lions? - Of course. - Why? Because I adore lions. My moment. Richard. No, no, don't stop! Dance on! - Please! - Someone's out there, who is that? My name's Craig, I'm a designer, a fellow artist, a creature of the theater, like you. Not yet anyway... and I saw you dance before your little blue drapes in Paris. I couldn't believe it... my own ideas exactly. That's why I had to see you alone. I would've been terrible to have met in a crowd. And I had to be sure. Sure of what? Of you. - Are you sure now? - Certainly. You're extraordinary. Extraordinary. I'm not your liebe frau, I have an engagement. - Nonsense, with whom? - But, I'm not in the habit... - With whom? - My mother. Your mother? The union between Edward Gordon Craig and Isadora Duncan never took place because Ms. Duncan had to go home to her mother for high tea. I've heard all about this family circus you travel around with you. - We're not a circus. - Artists have no business with families. I don't have a family, and I never will have. I have a mother... she's a great artist, she understands that I've got my work to do. My job is to make a world. To create a whole universe in the theater, a new unity for the actor, for the designer, and for the dancer. Where you were the dancer, we'll be at one with light and air. My light and my air. - Oh. - You're the dancer that I always imagined. You're the one who understands my language. I mean, the whole world you inhabit on that stage is a creation of mine. Come along in, make yourself at home. Don't dither about in the door, come in. Look at this. You see? That's a properly considered version of your set. - It's magnificent. - Yes, it is, isn't it? Now then. Let's see. I did this six years ago for the first act of Hamlet. You see, the pattern of light's the same as yours. The whole conception. - It's beautiful. - It's more than beautiful, it's much more... it's a totally new sort of place. When I saw you dancing on that stage, I couldn't believe my eyes. I thought I was seeing one of my own visions. You see, I invented you. I didn't even know you existed. "Unknown to each other," like two stars turning in the same heaven. And now, their paths have crossed, - "destiny has united them." - Go over and stand in the light. Good. You know, you're not at all like I was led to expect. Oh, what were you led to expect? Well, there are two schools of thought. One is that you're some sort of a Governess from Milwaukee, who's taken to prancing about the stage with your boots off suggestively. Is that what they think? Yes, some of them. Then, there are others who also say that you dance immodestly. But they add... that you're a great artist. And you, what do you say? - Oh, they all miss what I see. - What is that? Oh, the priestess, the revolutionary. Is that what you see? What else? That we're two halves of a puzzle, that we must work together, that we need each other. "Twin souls," like brother and sister united in glory! So alike they were, no mortal might one from other know. "Like as night their armor was, their steeds are white as snow." Stop prancing about and stand still! And take those damn boots off. The countess don't wear them. Magnificent. Magnificent. Yes. Yes, I'm yours. You belong to me. Ted. I was thinking. I've always been telling everybody, "If anything is sacred, human body is." And I thought I knew what I meant, but I didn't. How could I before I met you? Why did nobody tell me how beautiful men are? La la la la, la la la. La la la la la, la la. La da da da da da duh. Good... good. If I can just catch it before it moves, we can have moonlight whenever we want. - Are you going to let me do some? - No. I'm the painter, you're the dancer. You can do me a dance and keep the moon still. Moon, stand still in the heavens while my lover captures your light for eternity. Moon, cease your orbit while my lover snares you. Is it working? Has the light stopped moving? No, and it won't... The moon only listens to virgins. Then, I defy you, Moon! No, don't step in it! You're spoiling my moonlight! - Now all I've got is your rotten footprints! - They're beautiful footprints! Well, they spoil the design! Paint you red all over... I'll make you into a scarlet woman. You wait. Choo! Food... food for the wicked. Don't tell me, I know. Borscht and bread. It's cheap... I'll have yours if you don't want it. - Choo! - Gesundheit. - And to drink? - Cough medicine. Oh by the way, I saw one of your posters while I was out. Canceled owing to the indisposition of Ms. Duncan. I really have indisposition. What day is it anyway? - Friday. - Friday? We've been here a week already? My mother must be at her wits' end. Not to mention your impresario. - There. - Oh, well it can't be helped. Ms. Duncan has indisposition. Yes... very reprehensible, you know? You're a very immoral woman. Yes. I guess I am, I am. Oh, Ted, can one die of love? I wonder if my baby does the Charleston, Charleston I wonder who is teaching her the Charleston, Charleston. While I just sit inside, the time goes dragging by I'd like to kill the guy who wrote the Charleston, Charleston Archer, what comes next? What comes next? - We parted 'cause I couldn't do the Charleston. - Couldn't do the Charleston, Charleston. - And I... go on, go on. - Then, I'm afraid the words fail me. Words unfailingly fail you... Somebody must know the words of this song. No, madam. What about you then, do you know the words of this song? You've had your ears flapping all evening, you might as well join in. What about you, Mr. Bedford? You're supposed to be contemporary. Won't you sing for us? Well, I think I can manage "Everybody Loves My Baby." Well, sing it then. All right, um. Everybody loves my baby, but my baby don't love nobody but me... Oh, no, no, no, stop! Stop, that's dreadful. Where did you learn a terrible thing like that? - I'm sorry. - That's stupid, stupid! Do you know what I said when a reporter asked me what I thought of jazz? I said... I said, "Jazz? Jazz?" That is America laughing at Isadora Duncan." - Oh, Mary, my belle etoile... - Isadora, I'm going back. - Back? We're going to Paris. - Well no, it's getting late. - We can go to Paris tomorrow. - Tomorrow is a hypothesis. Mary... did you ask the patron? - Does he know his name? - No, but he has dinner here nearly every evening. Oh, well that settles it... Paris can wait... Come on, sit down, have some champagne. - Isadora, come back with me. - But, Archer's giving us a party. - We've got champagne... - Isadora, I'm tired, and I'm going. All right, you... all right, you send the driver back for me. I am going to get as drunk as 16 owls. I didn't want to go with her anyway. I hate being alone with women... It makes me feel like a nun! Now what should we do? - Ted! - There you are! Ted! You've come to see me. You've come to see me, you've come to see me! Oh, he's not staying... He just dropped in on his way to the other side of the world. - Oh yes, let's get into the wind! - Right! I can't think what induced you to come to this god-forsaken hole. It was mother's idea... she wanted to hide me away from the furious staring eyes. There's plenty to hide! - Do you know what she called me? - What? A vile seducer. But, she always calls you that... It's her special name for you. Oh! Now in the player scene, the gold cloth becomes a golden train which falls from the shoulders of the king and queen and down until, well, it covers the entire upstage area. Then in the closet scene, the gold cloth becomes the heiress. Through which Hamlet stabs Polonius. So you see, even though Claudius isn't on stage, Hamlet has to play the whole scene as if under his shadow. Oh, yes, yes that's marvelous. It is the Moscow's the perfect place to try it. I can't wait to see it. Well, you must come. Once all of this is out of the way you must come and join me. Yes, yes, I will. And he came straight for me and he tried to kill me. We've never even spoken and he came straight for me in his beautiful Bugatti. I think I'll try to buy one, at least I would if I had any money. I thought you were rich? Oh, not Bugatti rich, just dinner rich. You're rich aren't you? I wouldn't say that. I thought she said he was rich? I'm comfortably off. Comfortably off? Well, if you are comfortably off, why don't you buy me a Bugatti? - No. - I can't think of a better way for you to spend your money than giving me pleasure. I can think of some. I don't want him sitting at my table. Oh, come now, Isadora, don't be so touchy. Roger, I do not want him sitting at my table. Will you tell him to leave? It's all right, I'll go. - Should one wait for you? - No. Someone has better stay with her. Don't talk about me like that. Goodnight. Why do you say things like that? Why do you do things like that? Oh, topsy, if it's a girl call her Deidre, would you? Deidre, Deidre. That will make you feel better. Oh, I feel fine. You should rest, you owe it to the baby. I don't feel tired. Oh, mother, for heaven's sake stop that knitting. It's better than doing nothing, you should try it. I don't want to. I don't want to spend my life surrounded by women and medicine and knitting. I'm an artist and so is Ted. If he were a man, he'd be here with you. Mother, I don't want him here. I'm not going to marry him after all, even if he didn't have a wife I still wouldn't marry him. We talked all about it, he understands it, why can't you? Oh, Mother, don't. Oh, Mother, don't cry I need you. I need you, don't cry, don't. Of course I dream about Ted and the child and me living together and having a life together, I'm not unnatural. But it's a dream and I'm not going to be beguiled by a dream. In six months I'd hate him. Help me, help me, help me! Oh, help me, oh, help me, oh help me! Isn't there something you could give her? You have to wait, dear, you have to wait. But he said that for two days now. He doesn't want to help me, he doesn't want to help me! You wicked old man, you don't want to know how I feel. No, none of them want to help me! Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, give her to me, give her to me, give her to me. I did it! I did it, nobody helped me! All by myself, I did it! Come, come, come, come. Come in. Oh, it's you Pin. Quiet. Mary. Is she receiving? Well, not exactly but I'll see what I can do. Hey, sugie, hey, someone's here to see you. Lovely. Where'd you... How did you find him? Oh, it's Pin. Yes, don't mind you, it's only me, who did you think I was? I thought you were the... The most beautiful young man. And so I am, I am. No, darling, not the one I'm hoping for. The one she wants is called Bugatti. That's not a name, that's a car. Well, the name of his car is all we know abut him so far. - He nearly killed Roger and me. - Oh, him. Oh, by the way, that frightful journalist is here again. The one who's been wanting to buy your love letters. Roger's sent me up with his first installment. Oh, him, how dreary. What I've really come for is to show you my new system. It's absolutely unfathomable, the horseshoe spread, - you lay the top seven cards in a horseshoe. - You're not really going to sell your love letters - are you? - She can't, it would be bad taste. Cut. Did you take out the Reaper, I won't do it unless you take out the Reaper. Isadora, I always take him out, I don't like him myself. All right then, but you promise to deal me Bugatti. Right. Past, present, future, the querent, meeting Looking of Pentacles. Very interesting, I always liked him, he's the dark man. He's bravery and generosity. - Power, command, success. - Power, command, success. Well that is not Bugatti, that is Singer. Ms. Duncan, I promised myself to see you dance... Are you the one who's been sending me all these roses everywhere? Yes, I have. - I wanted to tell you how much I'd... - I wish I could've gotta hold of you, they're really not my favorite flowers. Ms. Duncan, you must let me finish my speech. Why? Because I paid good money to have it written. - Have you got it on you? - Yes, I have, but I know it by heart. Let's see. All right. - How do you like it? - It's very good. Yes, I thought so. Sit down. No, I haven't finished yet, there's something else. A little token of my esteem. Oh-ho-ho. Is... is this for my beauty and talent or is it payment in advance? Perhaps all three. This is how you spend all of your money, buying diamonds for ladies? Not all, I never can do it fast enough. I thought, perhaps, you might be able to help me? Are you mountainously rich? Mountainously. Well, that's a start isn't it? Singer, Paris Singer? This isn't sowing machines, is it? Yes, among other things. No, not at all. Who's that beautiful woman who keeps staring at you? - Do you know her? - No. Bonsoir. Good evening. - Who is she? - Nobody. She must be somebody. She dances nicely. - Oh, you know that necklace you gave me? - Oh, that was nothing. Yeah, well I sold it. I sold it, I don't really like jewelry, you don't mind do you? Mind, why should I mind it was yours. I hope you got a good price for it. Oh, that, I covered the debt and mortgage. - What mortgage? - I don't know, the lawyer settled it on the school in Berlin. Oh, you've got a school, I didn't know. There's nothing else I need money for. I like to lead a very simple life. You see, I don't sell my soul for silver, I dance to earn money for my school. We depend upon what I can earn. And on donations, that's all we have. Well, don't your pupils pay fees? I don't run a dancing school, I don't want rich children, they've money, they've no need for art. It's poor children I want, their need is greatest. They're much freer sensually. Of course, it means I don't get fees like the dancing school. Oh, it isn't a dancing school. No, to dance is to live and that's what I want. A school for life. I think you're going to have a pretty visitor. You own me a dance, monsieur. Would you excuse me for a moment, Ms. Duncan. - Madam is leaving. - Yes, monsieur, come on. I apologize for that, Ms. Duncan. Won't you call me Isadora? You do that every morning? What? Spend time making yourself beautiful. Healthy in mind, healthy in body. Do you have lots of mistresses? No, not at the moment. What'd you do when you get tired of them? Oh, I just snap my fingers and they disappear in a puff of blue smoke. - You're a magician. - Oh, yes. Can you transform yourself into a hundred forms like Zeus? Into a bull or a swan? Do you carry your virgins off in a golden cloud? Oh, yeah, all that's child's play. As for you, I'm going to put you in a little silver box and carry you around in my pockets and take you out and look at you whenever I feel sad. You'll have to let me out to dance sometimes. Oh, no, no one else is allowed to look at you, only me. But look at this, I can do other magic too. Oh, you know, I only sell them. You won't sell this. - What is it? - A magic key. - What does it open? - A new school. - You bought me a school? - That's right. - Where, where is it? - It's about ten miles outside of Paris - and it's beautiful. - Can we go see it, let's go see it. Stop trying to run away, you know. Tell me about it, how big is it? It's about 1,200 acres, very beautiful lawns and very quiet. I took one look and I knew it was for you. - So I just snapped it up. - You are a magician. Should we have a child? I want to have all my children by beautiful men. "I love you, I adore you, I own my lovely, my beautiful, my celestial dancer" signed " Doreen Montgomery, Secretary to Mr. Paris Singer in his absence". Now this one alone would be worth a fortune on the open market. Now listen, this is most promising. On either side we have The Knight of Pentacles and The High Priestess, that means thoughts of love in conjunction with art triumphant. - How about that for a start? - Sounds too good to be true. That's more or less impossible, arts and love destroy each other. I suppose it might be possible, for a short time with some people but you'd have to have a real run of luck. Elizabeth. Now we do that again, arms up and goes down. Everything rises up to those clouds, now begin to stretch. Stretch your fingers, everything. Now everything stretches. In and in and up to the sky and up and up and up to the sky. Come and get your strawberries! Come and get them! Francois, Nicole, Cece, come here everybody, gather around. We've got the strawberries! Yes, you've been very good, now the strawberries, off you go! There is enough for everybody. You'll never understand what I'm trying to do here. - Nonsense. - No, I mean it, here am I trying to instill ideas of beauty and simplicity and you bring them strawberries and cream in a Rolls Royce. Well, you can't have everything. I have to go to Nice next week, why don't you come along? - Why do you have to go? - Well, I don't know, the yacht needs careening - or some damn thing. - I didn't know we had a yacht, can we go for a ride in it? That's a good idea, sure. Well, you can, I get sea sick, you know. Yes, isn't that ridiculous. But you will come? I can't leave Elizabeth to cope with everything again. Well, bring somebody in and pay them and you'll feel no obligation. Mommy, mommy, Daphne's broke her leg, come and see! I'm sorry. All right, I'm coming. Mommy, you must come quickly, mommy, quickly. Oh, look Daphne's broke her leg. See you later. We'll have dinner. Patrick Michael Singer, my son and heir shall have a home. We'll go to England. It's Mommy, Nanny, it's Mommy. Here's Deidre. Oh, love. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I'm coming. Now where has Deidre gone? She's disappeared into thin air. Where is she, is the in the candice, no. Oh, Patrick, where has your little sister gone? Help me find her, please. Now let me think, is she under my pillow, no she's not. Where is she, is she under the coverlet? No, she's not. Where has she gone to? Deidre. She's gone into the garden, she must've gone into the garden. Where is she? Where is she. Got you! There she is, look we found her. Good, good. Now right through the hoop the first time. Ha, good, good. - Now it's my turn. - Oh, no, no, no, I get another shot. - Oh, I always forget. - Yes, whenever you go through a hoop - you get another shot. - All right. You're not lonely here, are you? Well, I do like people. Oh, well, there aren't many people in England. I don't mean society... Good! You hit mine again are you sure that's allowed? That's the whole point. I can knock the hell out of you now. I won't enjoy that. You know, you make things very difficult for me, Isadora. Difficult socially. It would be different if we were married, you know. - Well, we're not. - Why not? - Why won't you marry me? - On principle. Any woman who reads the marriage service and still goes through with it deserves everything she gets. Oh. I get another turn. You're a very hard woman, you know that, Isadora? Well, what is it that you want? You can work here. I've offered to hire you an orchestra. I don't need an orchestra. All right then. I'll get you a pianist, a beautiful, young pianist. Mr. Armand DuBris. This way. Coward! He's a good pianist, they tell me. He's repulsive! - So they tell me. - I'll put a screen around him. I can't bear to look at him, he looks like a frog. Why do you not let me see you, Isadora? Monsieur Armand, you are just to play until I tell you to stop. Play. Isadora, I only came because of you. I'm sorry, but I must explain to you, you are physically abhorrent to me. Same time tomorrow. We're sea lions. Will you throw us some bread. Yes, here we are. Catch, catch it for me, that's the girl. - That means she has to come out now? - Yes, I think she should. Come on, little frog. Oh, swim with your legs, you'll recognize it. Up we go, there. There we are. Now guess what Nanny got fishing. Hey, Isadora, what do you think? I've been planning our next twelve months. What do you say to Switzerland in the winter? And then? Oh, I thought the Nile in spring. You haven't been there, have you? I'd like to show you the pyramids. - And then? - Oh, I don't know, New York, Paris. You say, anywhere you'd like. Oh, nowhere, let's go nowhere. Oh, come on, you're getting bored around here we need a change of air. There's no need for you to stop dancing, you know. We can take Armand with us if that's what you're worried about. I've never seen you before, you're beautiful. Your soul shines through your eyes. In your eyes there is the smothered flame of genius. My frog, my little frog. My frog prince. Easy, Mr. Singer. Easy. - I hope this is doing me some good, Doctor. - Oh, it is, Mr. Singer, it is. - Yes. - Paris... It is very satisfactory. We've had the most encouraging reports from Zurich. Paris? I want to speak to you. How soon will we be able to feel the effects? Oh, we ought to yet. I have some important news, I do want to talk to you. Oh, switch off a moment will you, Doctor? Very well. What is it you wanted to say? I do want to be alone with you for a moment. Unstrap me, Doctor, and go. Oh, no, Mr. Singer, sit still, quite still for at least ten minutes to allow your carpals to settle. All right, I'll sit. Ten minutes, remember absolutely quiet, no excitement. Goodnight, Doctor. I've had an invitation to do a tour for Grosse, look! I can't bear to disappoint him. I'm so sad to leave you but I really feel I must go. - Good. - It'll mean leaving on Tuesday. - Good, that's settled then. - You're not upset are you, I couldn't bear... Is it all right, I'm in the middle of my treatment. All right, we'll talk about it later. Are you going to take the frog prince with you? What, I don't understand. Don't understand. "Ours is the story of the frog prince, only the princess could see who the frog really was." Do you think my servants don't tell me what's going on? - You've been spying on me! - Convorting about in my greenhouses, - rolling around in my automobiles! - How vulgar. - How hurtful. - I pay these people good money, - they are my friends, they're faithful! - So am I faithful! Fidelity is one of the most dominate traits in my character, but I am in love. In love with a man of genius, a man who's soul shines through his eyes. A man who is starved for vision which only I can fulfill. Would you get out of here and take your frog prince with you! - Because you have no soul! - Get out! Leave this house! - You have the soul of a tradesman! - Tradesman! Yes, and you know what you've got? You've got the soul of a whore! Goddamn organ grinder! Oh, what a mess, what a horrible mess. I'm not giving up so easily. Make way, I'm gonna deal myself a brand new life. Love and Bugatti, a valley of flowers and happiness. You shouldn't cut the card yourself, Isadora, it takes all the virtue out of them - and it's bad luck. - Bah, bah, bah, bah. Come soul of the world, flood through me. I got The Reaper. There's style for you, death on the first turn of the cards. It doesn't always mean death, it something means... The waiting lover, I'll see him tomorrow. - More love, I'll be satiated. - Let's stop, Isadora, - it's all getting rather boring. - Second card coming up, The Moon. The Reaper over the Moon, what does that mean, Pim? Death by water. "For months before I had premonitions." Why did I not heed them? That very morning when the nurse was trying to quiet the children for fear they might disturb my sleep. I said to her, 'let them play, where would we be without the sounds of their voices.' I was once told by a clairvoyant that I would lose those most dear to me in the world. I didn't listen to her. I had dreams and hallucinations but I paid no attention. I had not seen Singer for four months when I received his message saying, 'Come and see me' and I went. On the way, sitting in the car, holding the children in my arms, I was filled with a new hope. How often since, as in a nightmare, have I heard the warning voice against our going. But I thought the meeting with Singer would be so much simpler if the children were there. Where are they now? My poor, my fragile, my beautiful children. Singer wanted to speak to me alone and we sent the children off to see the sights of Paris. Then I kissed them. I kissed the glass in the spot where their lips come toward me. This cold touch remained on my lips. There are some sorrows that kill. That tragedy but to end all hope of a natural, joyous life for me. "Ever since then." I have had but one desire to fly, fly from the horror of it. My life has been but a series of fights. I've been but a phantom ship on a phantom ocean. The moments of my life that I recall with purest joy... had all been spent in the teaching of children. And so it was to be again. In the spring of 1921, I received a telegram from the Soviet government. It was so beautifully simple. "The Russian government alone can understand you, stop." Come to us, stop. "We will build your school." And so I said goodbye to the old world and set out to greet the new. I came to Russia with great hopes. I'd been promised a school and a thousand children. But it was a bad time. They came to me for food and shelter. "The children are homeless and starving," they told me, "and dancing's only a luxury. Why don't you give them bread?" I became fiercely determined that these children should have their bodies and their minds fed. The government could give me no material help beyond the building, so I announced that I would take 5 children only. I could not hope to feed and care for more. Here, in one large room, in a freezing palace stripped of hot water pipes, no beds, no mattresses, the former owner's furniture already requisitioned by the government, here I started my new school of the dance. Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! Isadora! It's Mary, she's shouting for you. I found it, the address! Monsieur Bugatti! What? Monsieur Bugatti! Bugatti, she's found him. Bugatti, I'm coming! I'm coming! I saw much hunger and misery in Moscow, but there is a great difference between the life of an artist and that of a saint. And I found ways of forgetting. I made friends among Moscow's poets, designers, artists, writers. Only they seemed to have the secret supplies of vodka and champagne. The idol of this generation was the poet Sergei Essenin. Madam, Sergei Alexandrovich... The first time I heard him speak, he was reciting his poem. - Da. - "Yes." "My Fate is Decided." He speaks about countryside where he was born. He says he's a lot like you, he cannot go back. He has descenced to create this poem to you, Madam. I know. I know. I never knew a poet could be as beautiful as his words. Would you tell him? What's he say? He says he wasted his life. Love is only hope. You golden boy. All right, now, this is a book. This is a pencil. The pencil is red. Is this pencil blue? No, it is red. This is all very well for children, I'm sure, but I can't talk to Sergei about red pencils. I want to know what to tell a young man when I want him to make love to me. How do you say, "I adore you"? Good, good, write it down. Now, "You have beautiful thighs!" Please, I beg you, Comrade Duncan! Come on, come on, "Sergei has the most beautiful thighs." What? Good, good, write it down, write it down. "I adore you. You have beautiful thighs." - We... - We... - make... - make... - love... - love... - like tigers. - Like tigers. Yes! Very good! We make love like tigers, yes! Tigers of the world, unite! And where have you been? Isadora very sad! Husband? No. Not husband. You're marrying you, baby. It's husband. Husband. - Adieu, husband. - Oh! No, Sergusha, not good! No, poor man! Isadora bite you very hard! - Adieu, old man. - Oh, no, poor old man! All right, all right. Adieu, young man! - Adieu, everybody! - Adieu, everybody! - Goodbye, everybody! - Adieu, Isadora! Adieu! Adieu, Isadora! Adieu, everything! Goodbye! We don't need you, Isadora, we don't need you! Adieu, old life! Adieu, children! - No, no, not the children. - Yes, yes! No, no, not the... No, dear, no, no, dear. No, dear, no. Not the children? No, no, no! Sergei, please, no! Your husband is dead! Your children are dead! I am your husband! I am your children! Yes, dear. Yes, yes. Oh, yes, yes. Isadora? What's that man doing? Who is he? - What? - The man in the studio. Oh, him. - Did you see him? - Yes, I did. I mean, Bugatti. Oh, no, I missed him. - He left when I arrived. - Well, aren't you going... I can offer 1,200 francs for the lot, now how's that? - I'm having a rummage sale. - Isadora, what is going on? I've decided everything! I am going to sell everything, my lease, my possessions, everything. I'm going to Paris tomorrow. I'm going to wire Elizabeth and I'm going to ask her to bring over 12 of the best pupils from the Moscow school, and we'll give a recital and we'll start a new school. That's marvelous! - It is, it is really, isn't it? - It's wonderful. Oh, Mary, I'm going to work again, I'm going to work again to save my life. Here they come. - Okay, well! - She looks pretty good from here! She looks sensational! Say, what kind of a passport do you suppose she has, American or Russian? Who knows? I'm gonna come for you reds, I'm warning you already. That's a promise. Welcome, America! Come on, move it! Move the party, come on! Come on, give us a break. Quiet, everybody, please. Quiet, quiet, everybody! Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Essenin will now address you. I bring you greetings from the young Soviet Union. In the revolution, American relief helped us very much with food and blankets. - I have come to pay back. - Oh, brother. The soul of America and the soul of Russia must learn to understand each other. Miss Duncan, you're looking wonderful. Tell me, how do you manage to stay so young? Well, I eat what I want, I drink what I want, and I am married to a beautiful man. Why were you refused right of entry so long, Miss Duncan? Because there were some officials there who think that to own a Russian passport automatically converts someone into a bloodthirsty criminal. Why did you become a Russian citizen? Because I fell in love with a Russian! And because, I know through bitter experience, unless you are very, very rich, that the hotel keepers of this country are not happy for a man and woman to share a bedroom together unless they have a wedding license. - It's finished for me. - Oh, no, no, no, my love... Oh, yes, it's finished! Sergusha will read some poems, won't you? Miss Duncan is planning some recitals of Russian dancing and Mr. Essenin will be reciting his poems. You'll excuse my asking, Miss Duncan. There were stories that your husband used violence towards you on the boat. Well, there was a party, and like all good Russians, we broke some furniture. Two awful lamps. I'm sure if you'd seen them, you might agree, we did a service to humanity. Would you describe yourself as a communist, Miss Duncan? Sergei and I are artists, and like all artists, we're true revolutionaries. I don't know anything about politics. I don't think a revolution should be political. I'm sure that if people will place their hands on their hearts and listen to their souls, they would know how we must live. I think that would be the true revolution. Sergusha! Come and read your poem, Sergei? I come, all right, I come. Poems in Russian, that's great. That'll make a great story! Go tell them I come! Go, go! I come, I come. Oh, merde. Now, Sergei is going to read you a poem. He is a Soviet Union, I'm American. Won't you reach out your hands to him as I have done? Mr. Essenin, are you a Bolshevik? I am poet. This morning, Isadora buy this for me. This is an American poem. It's beautiful. Beautiful indeed. Listen, are you sure this is all right? Yes, yes, it is. I will tell my first poem for America. A sheriff, a sheriff! Take it easy, folks, take it easy! It's only a toy! They're not real bullets! It's all right, it's not loaded. Brought an evil pestilence across our shores. A blight has just walked into our fair land. A blight in the shape of two Bolshevikan, communistic, revoluting troublemakers who never should have come here! Ain't got no right to be here! And should be run straight out of here in the name of Jesus Christ! Right, I say! Send them back! I say send them back to Russia and let them rot the souls of the people there! Only the people there don't have no souls! Go back to Russia! - Boo! - Boo! Red! That woman calls herself a dancer! Well, I've seen her! She don't wear enough clothes to pad a crutch! We don't need you in Boston! I say she looks pink, talks red, and acts scarlet! We don't want your act here! Get her off! Stop that! Miss Duncan, have some respect for the decency of my audience. We don't want her kind here! That woman and that bastard son of Gorka, they stink! My body? My body is beautiful! My body is free! Yes, we stink! We want to stink, ugly! We don't stink like you. You stink from the inside! My heart is pure! You stare at me because I... You know what? We don't need you here! You're nothing! You're dead! America's dead! Whore! Whore! Whore! You whore! Yes, I'm red and I'm pure! My body is pure, my soul is pure! A hundred times more pure than your half-clad chorus girls! You dead! You're gray, people in Boston are gray, and this theater is gray! The gray people afraid of liberation, afraid of the artists who rejoice in freedom! Go back! You rag stag people! Go back! Go back! I wanted to dance for you! The liberation of the Russian people! Because I thought America would understand! Have you forgotten our own great revolution? We were wild once! Don't let them tame you! You're rich, Isadora, you're rich! Don't be sad, darling, I'll come with you to Paris. We'll be together! I got another 800 francs from that agent. That man was really trying to fleece you! Do you know what you've done? You've betrayed me! What do you mean? My beautiful drapes. You've sold them. You've stripped me naked! What are you saying, Isadora? I was there when you told the agent you wanted to sell! I just told him that! You've known me for 15 years and you do not understand me at all! This is the one place where I could have been happy, - and you sold it! - It was you that decided to sell... You know I didn't want to! Well, all right, it's not too late. I'll tell the man you've changed your mind, if that's what you want. You wanted to go to Paris and you were afraid I'd change my mind, and so you rushed ahead and sold me for 30 pieces of silver! That isn't true, Isadora, and you know it! If you had any feeling for me at all, you would understand, but you have not! I am sick of the way you manage my affairs and my life and me! You have destroyed me! Judas! Oh, Roger! Oh, Roger! Come to me quickly, quickly, quickly! I need you. I just came along in case you needed my help. Oh, old Archer's asked us all to meet him later. He's heard about you selling up, of course. You mean there's going to be a party? Oh, yes, yes, yes, let's! - Hardly a party, darling. - Oh, please, please, please. Yes, let's, yes, let's have a party! And we'll celebrate my release from the tyranny of all of my chattels. Oh, someone who still loves me and cares for me. Do you still love me, Roger? Of course, my love, with dog-like devotion. Well then, that's what we'll do, we'll have a party. Mary and I have made a lot of money. I'm so happy. So happy. Roger, you shall be our cavalier, and we will dance all night! And I'll wear this lovely old dress. Do you like it? It's lovely, darling, lovely. L'amour, l'amour, l'amour, l'amour. Archer, Archer, here! - Isadora! - You're here! What a wonderful surprise! Oh, my! I don't know what to do! Help, I see red! Where are you taking me? - Trust me! - Where, where? This way! Now. Bugatti. La Duncan is dancing! - Bravo! - Isadora! Take me tonight. Here I go, singing low. Bye, bye, blackbird. Where somebody waits for me. Bluebird, bluebird, calling me far away. Adieu, mes amis! Je vais à la gloire!
