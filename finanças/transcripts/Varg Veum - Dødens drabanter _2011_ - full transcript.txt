Klaus? Your mail, Klaus. Klaus? I'II leave your mail here. Shit! Stay here! Come on! What's all this racket? About time! It should be done by tomorrow. The party ... Take a look at this, We got it yesterday. What do you think? -Should we have chosen the other one? -Yes, perhaps. Come closer. l cant't see. Come closer. I can't see. -You're crazy! -No! Veum? This is Hamre. Jan Egil Haugsrud, do you remember him? 17 years old, childwelfare case since before he was born. He just shot his foster parents and took a girl hostage. You're the only one he wants to talk to. Are you still there? We're picking you up. Get dressed. Mette? Hello? Wake up! Mette? Jan Egil! Don't take him away! Don't take him away! He took refuge in the hillside when the districtsheriff came. He's threatening to shoot the girl. He took a rifle from the farm. A Krag- J?rgensen, five shot magazine. He probably used it on his fosterparents. Do you have the goods? Try to calm him down. And make sure the girl is OK. Then we'll take over. Veum? Why is he so bent on talking to you? We're old pals from the time before I quit my job in childwelfare services. You didn't quit, you were fired. Jan Egil? It's me, Varg! I'm coming up. OK? I'll shoot you if you do anything! Don't move! -You wanted me to come. -I didn't do it! They were lying there when I came. What took you so long?! The chopper ... Did you see it? That was me. There was blood everywhere. Klaus on the coach and Karin on the floor with a phone in her hand. I went by him. We walk to school together, but he never showed up. -How long have you been here? -Since the mailman came. -We should have waited. -So they could shoot us? Jan Egil, they'll shoot you if you don't put down the gun. What? I don'tknow. I told you we should have waited. -The police wouldn't have believed us! -They'll shoot you. Put it down! Shut up! You think I did it too! You're just like the rest of them. I'm here to help you! I know you didn't kill those people. Jan Egil, look at me. We've known each other most of your life. Have I ever lied to you? It's important for me to know. Have I ever lied to you? Have I? Have you talked to mom? No. He didn't do it! Let him go! Shit! Varg! -You promised, you fucker! -He has surrendered. -Fuck you, Varg! -Just stay calm. He's just a kid! He is 17. Let me go. It hurts! It's OK. Get in. Mind your head. What did you do to your hand? Is that necessary? -I don't have any choice. -You always have a choice. I promised to help him. With what? Waking up the dead? You don't think he did it? No, I don't. Let me show you something. Klaus Libakk ... Here you are. First, he got a real beating. Then a 7 mm to the leg. He pulled himself towards the armchair, got shot in the stomach. He bled to death in less than ten minutes. The wife got shot in the kitchen, fell down, tried to get away. She got two more to the back ofher head. Four shots in total. Probably the same gun the kid was carying. He said they were lying here when he got home. He took the gun, left his prints all over the place, - - and stayed in the kitchen all night. Never called for help. The neighborgirl showed up. He took her hostage. Or she went with him voluntarily. He told us he would kill her if we came any closer. When the mailman came, he ran out. Veum, I'm sad to tell you this, but he has a terrible case. Can I talk to him? Can't you just let us handle this? For once. The ferry leaves in half an hour. Take it. That stunt you pulled was assaulton a police officer. -Which is a serious matter. -Yes, it is. Have a safe trip home. -Hello, Hans. -What happened? They were shot? Both of them. You're in charge of him. Hello, Cecilie. Where is he now? Sheriffs office. Come on. He dreaded this. That Jan Egil would kill someone? We thought it might help that he left the city. -When did he arrive here? -In August. He had been without a home for over a year. With these people it all seemed to work out. They had no children, plenty of space, lots oftime. Yet you were the one he asked for. After all these years. What about you? Married with children? The whole lot? No, But I have a girlfriend. How nice. And you? I'm OK. Hans and I became a couple. You left. I was asked to leave. To leave your job. Yes. They won't let us see him tonight. Interrogations will continue throughout the evening. Hello! I didn't hear the helicopter. You know Hamre. It's always a one-way ride. What do you think? Be honest. Well ... It's very ... Dynamic. It looks like a funfair. We should have taken the other one. It can be repainted. That you will do by yourself. Karin? I have to go back. Tomorrow. What about the party? An old client needs help. An old client? Can't you leave it to somebody else? He is 17 and charged with murdering two people. You don't have to ask about that. I'll wait. You missed this. It was hidden on Libakk's property. There were remains of alcohol in it Not the quality kind. You missed the ferry, then? Perhaps you should check it out. There could be a connection. Except for one minor detail: He has confessed. Half an hour ago. Said he killed them after a quarrel. Don't ask me. Call the station. You can't go in there. Jan Egil? You said they were lying there when you got home. Jesus Christ, we have all the evidence. The confession completes the case. -No moping. -Just check that can! Moody colleague ... Can you get this analyzed? Varg? -He confessed? -To killing them after a quarrel. Do you know the girl from the farm? Silje, yes. No, Varg. Come on. Hello. We would like to talk to Silje. The police said there was nothing more to talk about. -Don't worry. -They said he confessed. -Who is he? -An old colleague. Hello. -How are you doing? -Good. Good? What happened on the farm? -I don't know. -I thought you spent the day together. He said they were lying there when he got home. -He wouldn't call the police? -They would have blamed him. But you could have told them it wasn't true. Instead you went with him. Because he went crazy. He had a gun. l didn't know what to do. -What were you doing up there? -He wanted to show me something. You were there for hours. -He just said he didn't do it. -Come on! It's true. He was frantic. -Was Klaus Libakk selling booze? -What do you mean? -I don't know. -Were people buying booze at the farm? I don't know what you're talking about. Did you see anyone buying bootleg liquoratthefarm? I don't know. There was only Jan Egil. He just said he didn'tdo it. Again and again. He kept saying it. Could you please go now? I'm sorry for this. Here is my card, in case she remembers anything. Who the hell is that guy? I don't know. Fancy looking. Veum? Langeland, Jan Egil's lawyer. I heard what you did yesterday. You know him from before? -What's going on? -He is being moved to Bergen. Why? Not much more to do here. Perhaps you can help us with information on his background, etc. Why did he confess? Why? Caught at the crime scene, no alibi, taking a girl hostage ... What did you expect? -You think he did it? -I gave him two alternatives: Either admit to everything - - or deny it until the evidence gets him convicted anyhow. -Jan Egil? -You don't understand anything! What is it that I should understand? Don't ask me. You're the detective. You think he did it too? Do you know him? Not as well as you do, apparently. You're the one heasked for. -He is more than just a case for you? -Makes no difference now, does it? He may be innocent, But the police have him. He confessed. He had a boat house at Ankerneset. -Jan Egil? -No. Klaus. It wasn't his. But he was there all the time. What happened earlier ... Shit. I'm sorry. Varg, come have a look! -Is that OK? -Yes. Klaus Libakk was a bootlegger. Thank you ever so much. He tried to get rid of plasticcans at the Ankerneset. I'll have the sheriff look into it. I'm trying to quit. -What? -Something. -Aren't you slightly curious? -Of course I am. But we had this case many years ago. The liquor came from Portugal through Bergen. You could go by the smell along the coast. I don't think the liquor is connected tot he murders. Why not? All the evidence points to the kid, he was capable of it, he had a gun - -And he confessed. -Jan Egil, come on out! What if he is lying? Why should he? Have you met his lawyer? Langeland? He is going to withdraw that confession, It won't stand in court. I think it will. -He's not the kind to kill people, -You've made that clear. But your opinions don't matter in court. OK, give me that piece of plastic. I'll have someone look at it. Are you happy now? Yes, now I'm happy, Jan Egil, we're coming in. The kid has swum ashore. Some driver spotted him near Skarsnes. We're sending two vehicles. Veum! Don't touch him! -Do you know where his mother lives? -Yes. They haven't seen each other for years. He asked about her. But he didn'twant to see her. I suggested it, but he refused. He didn'twant to have anything to do with her. -Yes? -lt's me. -Where are you? -Has he called? -What did he say? -He wanted to talk to you. -He said it was important, -Tell him to call me. Cecilie used to call this ''the favela''. How are you two doing? Haven't talked to her for a while. I thought you were together? That was some time ago. It was you she wanted. I'll handle this. Sorry to bother you this late. This is Veum. -Can we come in? -He's not here. It will only take a few minutes. I heard it on the radio. A 17 year-old in Randsfjord. I did the math. Has he contacted you? No. Why should he? Because he has escaped. -Has he called you? -No. Are you sure? I know when people call me. It was you, wasn't it? You and that woman ... -Do you know where he is? -No. I wouldn't have told you if I did. He probably had his reasons for escaping. It was you! You just took him right out of my arms! -You were unfit ... -You took my only child away from me! You don't have children? If you had, you would have thought twice. How cowardly, cold and cruel of you! It was 16 years ago. We made the right decision. She was given numerous chances to take care of that boy. -But she couldn't? -No. You still wonder whether you made the right decision? That's how the job is. You left at the right time. Jannicke ... It's the third time in a month. A form of GHB, but stronger. Certain things have changed since you quit. Is Jan Egil doing GHB? No, I don't think so. Is there anything left? Is there anything left? Give it to me! Give it to me now! This is our Jannicke. Now she's dead! Do you understand? Where did you buy this? Who is dealing this? Answer me! Don't go! Answer me. Who are you buying this from? You idiots! -You haven't forgotten? -No. There are many people who want to meet you. -When will you ...? -I'll be there soon. Varg? I don't know the number. Pick me up around ten. We'll do it then. I have to go, The battery is running out. OK, bye. I missed you. -lt's nice. -I know. You almost made me repaint it. Can I get you a cold beer? Come here. I want you to meet some people. -Hamre on his way home. -Where did you find Libakk's phone? Can we discuss this tomorrow? I'm on my way home. -Aren't you in bed? -No. I'm dead. Don't send flowers. -Getting your overtime, I hope? -Yes. Unl?ke you. Thanks for your concern, but I have enough to get by. The phone was hanging on the wall. Jan Egil said it was on the floor, in Mrs Libakk's hand. -Nope. -He said so. He also said he was innocent. -Who did he make the last call to? -He never called for help. -I never said he did. -He didn't do shit. Then this girl showed up. Who did he make the last calll to? Terje Hammersten. Do we have any cars downtown? No cars downtown. Great. Jan Egil! Jan Egil! He was probably killed with his own revolver. A 45 caliber licensed to him. Did you see the weapons closet? -But you couldn't wait? -You never came. Who was he? Terje Hammersten. In and out of jail for the last 15 years. Assaults, threats, theft, contraband ... Yes, he and Klaus Libakk were selling booze. Case dismissed, lack of evidence bad police work. And shut up. I didn't say anything. Was Hammersten at the farm at the time of the murders? He was seen drinking at a pub at the time of the murders. -But someone called him? -At his flat, yes. At the time of the murders. The person calling didn't reach him? The cans you found didn't contain any liquor. It was gamma 4-hydroxybutyrate. Does that mean anything to you? -GHB. -Also known as ''liquid ecstasy''. Sounds fun, but people die from it. But why did Klaus Libakk want to get rid of it? -A sudden attack of guilt? -Maybe. But why does the kid kill eveyone involved in the case? You're the policeman. Jan Egil Haugsrud, was it? I searched his name after the guests left. Not a happy story. His father died before he was born. His mother was on heroin. Was that when child welfare services got involved? He has probably been in and out of 20 fosterhomes. Why is that? No one can cope with him for very long. Let me see you throw, then. Show me what you got. -Was I bad? -Yes. What did you say? How bad am I? -Terrible! -Am I terrible? Everything is OK! Hello, I knocked but nobody opened. I'm Cecilie. Varg and I used to work together. I'm Karin. Do you want me to wake him up? I can do it. Varg? Hey. You didn't answer your phone. I think l know where he is. Remember the cabin we used to go to? -Do you guys want some coffee? -No thanks. A neighbor said the lights were on last night. He checked, but nobody opened. -Have you talked to Hans? -I can't reach him. Bye. I think I know where Jan Egil is. Drive carefully. Jan Egil! He was dead when I got there! What were you doing at the farm? He called me. -That's not good enough. -He left a message on the voicemail. Take it! Jan Egil? It's Terje. I have something to show you. It's really important. When I got there, somebody had shot him. Why did you confess? They said they had evidence. The lawyer said I would be locked up for years. He just wanted to know where the goods were. He said I would get ten years. Since I was in on it, I had to know ... Jan Egil? What goods? Ten liters ofconcentrate. -GHB? -Yes. -Do you know where? -No. Just that they would get rich. They didn't know I was eares dropping. -It's me. -I know. -I've got a name. -Jesus, Varg ... -I've found Jan Egil. -Where? -Near Ringevik. -Why don't you call the cops? -Jens Langeland, a lawyer ... -I've heard of him. Can you check if there is any connection between him and Hammersten? Karin? You know, Varg ... It wasn't easy to get you to move in with me. I know I can be difficult sometimes. But I don't get this. You're out there with some ex from childcare services. -That was many years ago. -Fair enough. But I think you're very too involved. I'll be back soon. I'll see what I can find. You're hot. What happened to the Citro?n? It died. -I could have looked at it. -Yes, but it died. I fixed Klaus' tractor, you know. The gear was broken, it was leaking oil, Auto repairshops are expensive. You said Mrs Libakk had the phone in her hand. -The police found it on the wall. -I hung it there. -I was going to callt he police. -But you changed your mind? Is yours so tiny that you have to buy a car this big? Was that such a good idea? We'll see. -Where are the keys? -In the car. You shouldn't leave them in the car. Do you want to play cards? Can you afford it? All in. Call off the flop, Do you have the king? Look what I found. Do you remember this? You must have been five years old. -Is that an aeroplane? -It's a boat. A boat? A boat with wings? Those are oars. A boat with oars in the sky? And a propeller. It's an outboard motor. Hey! We weren't finished, What are you doing? I had a king! He fell asleep right away. Look what I found. I'm trying to quit. What? -Everything. Have you ever considered going back to child care services? Yes. But ...? But then I came to my senses. This job is meaningful as well. Insurance cases, distribution of estates, adultery ... Adultery? Nudity, muckraking, tears and pictures ... The richer you are, the more you screw around. And then they call you? Do they pay well? Especially if they're having a hard time. Are you and Hans together? No. We were. But it didn't work out. I couldn't even talk to another man ... Does he know we are here? No. Hello. It's Karin. Listen to this. Langeland has defended Hammersten in several cases. The first case was in 1992. And he has kept on ever since. Assaults, threats, booze, drugs ... More importantly: Langeland himself was investigated for holding drug money. Charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Thanks, Karin. Are you coming back? Veum? Why did you ask Jan Egil about the goods? Klaus, Hammersten ... There was a lot of money involved? Why did you question Jan Egil about it? What are you doing? -Jens! -Go back inside! Do it. I don't know what you're talking about. You wanted Jan Egil to tell you where the goods were hidden. It was Hammersten who ... -What? -It was just something he said. Libakk had a huge stock after the last job. Libakk and who? I thought Jan Egil was involved, He must have known what they were doing. -Why didn't you tell the police? -I wanted Jan Egil to admit to it. If hetook the blame that would be his choice. You didn't know it was GHB either? You didn't want to sell it yourself? I just wanted to know where it was, so I could destroy it. I think you're lying. What if the kid is innocent? Police! Freeze! It's obvious he did it. What's going on? He knew about the GHB that Libakk and Hammersten were hiding. I see. And that gives you the right to beat up people? Jesus! People will think we have a relationship. You can live with that. I think we have different humour. How did you know about Langeland? If you know where the kid is, I want to know! You're letting him go? Do you know what he just did? Yes. -How many people are on call? -Very few. It's getting late. See what you can scrape together. I want to know where he is going. -Hello? -Hi. -Where is he? -He's sleeping. The lawyer did ask Jan Egil about the money and the goods. I'll tell you more later. Are you on your way back? I have to talk to Hans first. You won't tell him about what happened between us? There is nothing to tell. -GHB? -Yes. Luckily we found out in time. I have to talk to the parents. You know how it is. Yes. But we didn't have GHB back then. When you OD, you choke. Can you imagine a more painful way to go? She is 14! Hans? Did Jan Egil ever mention Klaus and Hammersten holding goods and money? -What kind of goods? -GHB. No. What did he say? That he didn't do it. But I think he knows where the GHB is. His mother paid a visit to Hammersten right before he was killed. Give me an hour to wrap this up first ... Good evening. Do you want company? Very well. Come with us, and we'll do this nice and calmly. -Does he have Hammersten's revolver? -Jan Egil never had one. That's what I thought. Let's move! Hello? Help me! Remove that. I'm here! Jan Egil! He's heading towards the city, Let's meet up there. He may go ashore before that. Garnodden, next to Ask?y. His mother lives nearby. Get me Mette Haugsrud on the phone, please. Remind me to arrest you later. -Are you there? Hello? -You! Hello? Can you go any faster? -Mette? -Veum! Hello? This is Hamre. I have two cars blocking the town center. She has a concussion but she'll survive. Where are you going? He was looking for something. As he was at Hammersten's place. The phone ... Hammersten had a charger, but no phone. Who did he make the last call to? Can you plug it in, please? Thanks. That's police work. Police work? This is Hammersten's voicemail. Leave a message after the beep. Terje, he is here! He knows about the goods. Oh my God! Hang up that phone! Please! Hans? Hang up! Or I'll shoot you! No!! Hi. -Where is Varg? -He's right behind me. We agreed to meet up there. OK. Thanks a lot. The car may have been spotted in town around 09.30. -Any news about Jan Egil? -We found the boat, but not the boy. We're searching the city, We have to find him before Hans does. Jan Egil! The girl's mother says she is neither at home nor answering her phone. Right! Be quiet! Areyou sure it was here? Yes, l'm sure. I saw Klaus and Terje bury it there. Pull it up. Varg! Don't move! -What is it that you want? -Stay still! Don't move! Look at this. It's death in a concentrated form. How many children's lives would this have taken? I tried talking to Klaus and Terje. They gave me no choice. I had to. You would have done the same thing. No, Hans, I would not have done the same thing. -Jan Egil, let me have that! Don't move! He killed them! I got the blame! Put the gun down! Why should I kill them? He killed Klaus and Kari. I liked it here. It was my home. I wanted to stay here, but he killed them! -I just want to help you. -You said that the last time as well. You all said I killed them, You didn't believe me. Nobody cared about me! Not even my mother. Your mother believed you. No, she didn't. -Then why did she send me away? -She didn't want to. -How do you know? -I know because it was me. I was the one who sent you away. I didn't think she could take care of you. I sent you away, Jan Egil. It's my fault. Varg! How long? 14 hours. The doctor said you needed sleep, so I let you sleep. -How long have you been here? -All the time. What do you think? I'm sorry, Karin. You're alive. So stop saying that. I love you. I know. I love you too. Damn it, Varg ... If I had lost you ... I wouldn't have managed. I'm sorry. I'll come back later. Cecilie? Are you looking for...? This? It's Hans'. Thought you might want it. How much did you know? I knew nothing. Right. Hans was called up right after Jan Egil ran away from the cabin. I checked the log. The call was from you. Fortunately, the mother didn't die. Perhaps you'd like to tell the police yourself? In my eyes he was no murderer. They killed children, children we were responsible for. -You could have done the same. -Three people ... He killed three people. I would never have done that. No. Go. Aren't you ...? She's not my mother. English subtitles: S?ren Munch
