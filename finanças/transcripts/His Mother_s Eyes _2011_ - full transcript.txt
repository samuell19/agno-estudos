Dad. I'm here. I love you. A writer must report everything he sees and hears. The life of a public figure doesn't belong to them. Why a pseudonym? Why? To preserve my freedom. - You could be famous. - I have no desire to be. Our role is to track those who behave badly and to denounce them. Who's this? Miguel Canalès, with Lena Weber, in the '60s. She put him up in Paris. Should everything be written about? If a public figure behaves hypocritically, yes. - OK. Thank you. - Goodbye. What about this? Maria Canalès, Lena Weber's daughter. A principal dancer. And that's me. - You danced? - No! I did a set-design internship. When do you start? Have you seen her since? On stage. I daren't bother her. It's funny and sweet. You've changed, though. Mathieu! Could someone help me? Do you often pass out? It's hypotension. I've always had it. I know someone good. I'll give you his name. Thank you. So you're willing to stand in for that pregnant idiot? I'd love to. She's actually very nice. What's wrong? Judit called. - Miguel? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Good evening. Did you speak to Mum? Is she coming? She has to read the news. It's better this way. The funeral of journalist and writer Miguel Canalès will be held at 3pm. Many politicians and celebrities are expected. Exiled in France, Mr Canalès moved back to Spain after Franco died. He was one of the first to back the Law of Historic Memory... There's quite a crowd. People I haven't seen since I was a girl. The mayor has arrived. The minister will be here in 10 minutes. I'll go get ready. I bought my ticket for Friday. There's lots to do at the foundation. I need to be in Paris. I'll take care of it there. It isn't a good idea. You can't make decisions in moments of crisis. Think about it. My mind's made up. I've been thinking about it for 20 years. I want him to know I exist. He must have the choice. Thank you for talking to us about your new novel, which was published last week by Grasset. That's the end of the news. Thank you for watching. Join me again tonight at 8. Goodbye. That was great! Happy? People will want to read it. Thanks to Lena. She makes you feel so at ease, you want to open up. Come back whenever you like. I will. I have to get back to my kids. Thanks. I had no choice. Marchand is very pleased. That's love for you! She wasn't that bad. "Fame is a gilded cage. I made a pact with myself." Coming, Mathieu? She didn't mention undocumented immigrants. That's a private matter. She'd hold a press conference to announce her period. Oh, that's a bit mean. I want to change tonight's running order. I won't have time later. We'll play it by ear. Nothing's a problem with you. It's wonderful. Everything's sorted for the remembrance evening. You'll be met at the airport and taken to Antoine's. I got him gloves. That's too much, Mathieu. I've become dependent on you. I bought you some ginger tea for your blood pressure. Thank you, Lena. The exhumation began a few months ago, and will continue for several years. My father, one of Franco's fiercest opponents, helped initiate the programme. She has been looking for her brother's body for 60 years. The Francoists took him one night, with other village men. They dug their own graves before being shot. My grandfather was one. He was killed. We would like to bury those forgotten in these graves. What are you going to do? I'll write to him. Write to him. - Are you allowed? - That's irrelevant. You've no idea. The boy might be a lunatic. He works in a hotel and is an amateur boxer. What's his name? Bruno. Why are you so worried? You're confused. You've got the exhibition, the show... How can you possibly focus? Can I help you? They're Year-9 students. Their Spanish is better than yours. That's mean! When you were small, and your mum was in Nicaragua or with the mujahideen, you did exactly the same thing. You'd knock, come in, slip into my bed and ask me about your father. I told him. Before he died, he knew he was a grandpa. And he was pleased. See you later. I'm doing a wash. Is all your laundry on the floor? There's this too. How did it go this morning? Dad seemed disappointed. Call him. Keep out of it, Bruno. You mentioned it. Staying for lunch? - Going to keep it up long? - What? Hiding with your bloke. I wasn't hiding. I told you it was over. I don't owe you an explanation. You hid, though. You almost got run down. Why didn't your father drop you off? He's meeting me at training. Staying for lunch? - Yes, but quick. - I'll get a move on, then! Let it flow, let the movement flow. Hello? Hello? - It's Lena. Is this a bad time? - No. Go on. - Have you tried my tea? - Not yet. It's very effective. What did you want? - Hello? - Sorry, Mathieu. I just did the Express interview. I'd like you to read it. Of course. - Where are you? - Meeting up with friends. Pity! I'd have invited you for a drink. Another time. OK, Mathieu. Goodbye. Goodbye, Lena. Maria. I saw you walk past and... - Have we met? - Years ago. - Really? - Gisèle, Opera Bastille. 10 years ago at least. Mathieu. Mathieu Roussel? I was doing an internship. I've changed a bit. Yes, I think I remember you. I've followed your fabulous career. Thank you. What do you do? Set designing? - No. I'm a writer. - Really? My taxi's waiting. How many so far? 60,000 copies. They haven't tried to ban it. You're going to sell way more than usual. You should've signed it. I like the sound of Phil Bouconet. Another one. The anonymous calls? I feel stalked. This is hardly Watergate! How's Weber? We're as thick as thieves. She buys me tea. - When are you writing it? - I've already started. I'll come. Goodbye. - Thank you. - Maria. I heard you were here. - Can we talk? - Yes. I tried to get hold of you. - Did you get my voicemails? - I was busy with Dad's foundation. We could meet up again. Yes. But I'm very busy with the rehearsals. For the show with Sylvain? That's good. I'm nervous. I wanted you there. I needed you. I know, I'm sorry. How are you? I miss him. One, two, three. Excellent. One, two. One, two. Front body. Go on, Bruno. Attack. Go on! An autograph? Here. It's awful! No, I think it's good. You look like a champ. For the fight. - They're yours! - Borrow them. Now that's love! Know how many fights your dad won in them? Wash them afterwards. Go get changed. Hello. Hello. I read your Express interview. And? Change the last answer. "A rich life, a few bruises..." "Bruises" isn't you. Knocks. Much better. - What about time passing? - It's perfect. I hate getting old, just like everyone else! Mention the photos. I've been trying to get hold of you. How can I help you? Bone up on Fabiani. He's your guest today. That's good news. I forgot my phone. Mathieu, be a darling. Go to my place. It's on the shelf in the hall. All right, OK. - Hello, Jean! - This came for you. Thanks. - Your white wine. - Thank you. For Maria, whose steps I've followed from afar. In memory of Gisèle. Mathieu. - Hello? - Mathieu? Hello, it's Maria Canalès. I wanted to thank you. I loved your book. Sorry, I'm in a meeting. I'm sorry. I'll call you, OK? OK. Goodbye. Sorry about that. - Been waiting long? - No, I just got here. How are you? Sorry, Judit. I don't know, make something up. I'm exhausted and poorly. I don't want to socialize. I'll try to make it for coffee. Take care. It's a sweet photo. You haven't changed that much. - You can keep it. I have a copy. - Thanks. Dancers aren't meant to drink but... Want some? No, thanks. Too late! Your book jogged my memory. Your mum had just died. You were a kid. I was in awe of you. I terrified you. You seemed so sad. I don't think I even spoke to you. I can't have been very kind. Now I know how you felt. Have you written others? I'd like to read them. - Not yet. I'm working on one. - Really? There's a guy with glasses. That's the gallery owner. And Sylvain? I think that's him. You should go. No. Or we go all the way. What are they doing? Talking. I think they're saying goodbye. Someone's coming. Get down! This really hurts. I've got cramp. Quiet! They're looking at me. Be natural. He's getting in his car. He's driving away. You can come out. - Sorry. - No, it's OK. I had a good evening. You can say I kissed you. Béjart said a dancer is part boxer, part nun. Asceticism really isn't my thing. I've never denied myself anything. I eat, drink and smoke. I've always had an appetite. So much so that it scares them. Your partners? The people in the business. Remember how on the last day you took me to one side and kissed me? No! That isn't true. You're making it up! I'm sure it isn't true. It is. I have absolutely no memory of it. Thanks! I have absolutely no memory of it. Thanks! I'd like to thank Lena Weber for being here today, for getting down from her television throne to drink with us. Don't talk about me like that! Lena, I owe my best clichés to you. - True. - I'd be nothing without you. You're always welcome among those who work in the shadows. Olivier, I have to go. Enjoy your retirement. But report back to me! Thanks for coming. I needed my chieftain. How's the news show? 15 year as anchor. You thought I wouldn't last. I've heard rumours I don't like one bit. Rumours about what? Radical changes in the 8pm news. You've always been one for conspiracy theories. Be careful. And call me if you want to thump someone. - Bye! - Ciao! That's great. Two kilometres more than last week. Not out of breath? No, I'm fine. Are you OK? - Don't be cheeky! - Or what? You'll fight me? OK, I'll stop. You're so unforgiving. What? Hasn't Mum paid enough yet? You should come home. Stay out of it, it's none of your business. Want to give me a heart attack? You're sweaty. Cover up, or you'll get a cold. I ran the trail in 45 minutes. It isn't good for you, to drink ice-cold water. Training was great. Yes, your dad said. He's confident. He can be. He wants to impress you. Give it a break! I can't bear seeing you get hurt. I suffered enough with your dad. It'll be harder if you're not there. We'll see. This came for you. When's dinner? Half an hour. I can't tonight. I had training, I have to rest. Hang on, I'll call you back. "Bruno, it's the first time I've written the name I didn't give you. "I didn't feed you, see you grow or teach you. "The only moment I shared was giving birth to you. "I was 16 years old. "I looked at you, smelt you, "held you for an hour "before you were taken away. "For 20 years, I've had to write this letter. "I'm not trying to find an excuse. "But I want to explain. "I'm a dancer. "When you were born, I lived and breathed dance. "One day we were told there'd be a tour. "I was picked for it. "During the tour, I met a man, your father. "He was a musician. "Our paths crossed briefly, but I loved him. "He was almost as young as me. "When I found out about you, I was already 5 months pregnant. "Dad lived in Spain, Mum was never around. "I was lost and frightened. "I couldn't be your mum, I wouldn't have known how. "You were born in Lyon, at Dr Violet's clinic. "When I left the maternity clinic, "I lost a part of myself." "I'm strong enough to approach you now, "to face your anger, resentment and inability to understand. "Your curiosity too, maybe. "I've no right to contact you. "You've not asked to meet me, but I'm reaching out to you. "Even if you feel it's too late. "I'd like you to take my hand. "Now you know who I am, I shall wait for you. "Whenever you feel ready. "With love, your mother, Maria." They assured me there'd be a current-affairs show. - Weekly? - Monthly. You wanted a change of pace. I decide when I change pace! How will they justify it? The journalists' union has filed a complaint against you. What hypocrisy! It's disgusting. Who's replacing me? They haven't approached anyone. They need your popularity. They'll issue a pretentious statement: "A change in the editorial line." You'll keep your salary. They won't rush things. They'll want to talk to you. - I need you to protect me. - It couldn't last forever. Try to see it as a new chapter. What? That's exactly what you said when you left me. Talk about bullshit! I want Marchand to tell me himself! Let it go. It's time you eased off. Let them run the race without you. I said to wait downstairs! - When will they announce it? - There's plenty of time. You'll discuss it and decide together. I want to announce it. Maria, tell us more about your work in Spain and the campaign initiated by your father. There are 30,000 victims in Franco's mass graves. We're demanding proper graves. Like thousands of families, I want my grandfather to be... Let's go! You don't mind if I smoke, huh? Did you hear our conversation? They're firing me. People watch you every day and grow old with you, but they can't bear to see you grow old. I love my job. I don't want to quit. I intend to fight. I still scare them, you know. I bet you do. You're an odd guy, Mathieu. Very efficient, but not chatty. I can't make you out. It's as if you're not really there. Maybe it's shyness. I don't think so. - I hear you've written a book. - Years ago. What was it about? My mother. - I wrote it when she died. - I'd like to read it. You rarely mention your mother. When I was 9, she was on assignment in Lebanon. We were on the phone. I heard an explosion, then silence. I didn't hear from her for a whole week. Everyone thought she was dead, but I knew she'd be back. I learnt to protect myself from her absences. Thank you, Maria Canalès... Drop me in rue de Lisbonne instead. All right. I figured things would improve with time. But in fact, it's the opposite. Maybe I don't always go about it the right way. She probably doesn't either. That's sweet. Right. I'll go up and wait for her. Come with me. She'll be pleased to see you. Another time. It's best you go alone. You've changed the place. I repainted 7 years ago. I haven't been here since Maria's 20th birthday party. Miguel came from Spain. How long have I been coming to you for news of my daughter? You heard the show? "I learnt to protect myself..." She can't talk that way! I can't bear her outpourings. She should say things to my face. Did she say she ran into me? No. 2 strangers with nothing to say to each other. I don't understand how it's come to this. I wouldn't know where to start. What does that mean? Your life revolves around you, your work, your career. It always has. That's unfair. No! It's the truth. It's simply an explanation. I only just got here, and you decide it's time to tell me a few home truths. It's a bit harsh. You want me to say Maria's unfair? That you had extenuating circumstances? You had her very young? It's true, but it changes nothing. Get together and talk. That's why I came. I'm tired of playing the saint! - Is that why you're kicking me out? - I'm not kicking you out. - Goodbye! - Adios. You look beautiful! Here, this came for you. Let's go! The taxi's here. Did you write to him? Want to be alone? Stay. Not interested Bruno The strange thing is, when you're made a principal dancer, you don't dance better than you did the day before. And yet, it's a title that changes everything. From that moment on, you're given unlimited credit. People look at you differently. But... I think that... I think you remain a student your whole life. Yes, hello? Hello? Excuse me, I have to go. You're wanted for a photo. I'm going. You're leaving now? I've had enough. You wrote, he replied. You can move on now. I just don't want you to be hurt. Stop deciding for me! How could you have done that, you bastard? I trusted you. That's for page 82. Mathieu! What happened? He took my wallet. Sorry, I have to rub it a bit. It's OK. I put it on my toes when I have blisters. Why not go to hospital? If it works on your feet, it'll work on my cheek. I'll see. It'll help you sleep. You'll have sweet dreams. Thanks. What was in your wallet? Papers, money, nothing important. Is there anyone I can call? What for? You should lie down and take it easy. Have you drugged me? Yes. With what I gave you, I can't take advantage of you. What's your name? Maria Canalès. - You're at the Opera Ballet School? - Yes. - You want to be a principal dancer? - Oh, yes! I want to, and I will be. My mind's made up. So, yes, I'll be a principal dancer. Have you seen this footage? No. But her strength astonishes me. Maria, do you recognise this young girl? Yes. But apparently my mother doesn't. Maria, it's me! Wake up. Sorry. It's Judit. I don't want her to see you. - Maria. - Coming! - Are you in pain? - No. Sorry. I was calling all night. You didn't answer, I was so worried. I'm sorry. I was mean to you. You asked me to throw this away. I figured you'd want to see it one day. - Won't you open it? - Not now. Are you sorry we kept this secret to ourselves? I'll meet you later. I'm going. Thank you for last night. My daughter, my child... We listened to this song lots when you arrived. You tell me that every time. To change seasons To change homes To change habits I think of it every evening as I look and see Your childhood breaking free Who was the letter from? A maths teacher. The one who moved to Paris. Not ready for the seminar? I'm not going. I forgot to tell you, sorry. Besides, HD... I'm not in great shape today. But I'll invite you for lunch tomorrow, for your last day. Today's my last day. Really? What happened to you? Nothing. A bad encounter. You really are a strange boy. Let's stay in touch. I'll come change them next week. Have you thought about the flat? Don't start that again! You have to sell it, Mathieu. And move on. It isn't healthy. But it's my home. Your mum said, "Don't die with the dead." And you live in a mausoleum. Everyone has their own way of coping with grief. You're ruining your life with your pain. Mathieu. - You're reading this? - He's your friend, isn't he? I've sold a fair few. I have to be able to discuss it. Do you like it? It's a quick read. It's pretty juicy. Do you still see him? No. We weren't very close. You must need money. No. I invested my earnings. I have a talent for it. It's OK, I'll get this. Shit, my wallet! See you tomorrow. Bye. - A gentleman's looking for you. - Really? Thanks. I was looking for you. I was rehearsing on stage. We open in 3 days. Still in pain? It comes and goes. No one's there! Where are you? One, two. One, two, three. Tell me! Fuck! Gimme a break! - Don't beat the shit out of me! - You're not listening. If you're elsewhere, forget it. You'll get slaughtered. Face on. Come on! You're miles away! Fuck you! Leave your problems at home when you come training. Lights! Put the fucking light on! - Where does he live? - Brittany. I've tried in vain not to feel ashamed of myself. I wrote to him 2 weeks ago. He doesn't want to see me. It's understandable. I can't force him. He looks cute. Everything's in the file. I'd love to know what he looks like now. - How old were you? - 16. I was a frightened kid. I thought I'd have to sacrifice everything I'd worked so hard for. I didn't tell anyone but Judit. - How did you find him? - A detective. Does your mother know? No. Certainly not. Why don't you see each other? We lost touch. We pretended to believe it was... because we were too busy. Wasn't it? Is this an interrogation? Only kidding! Talking to you about it actually makes me feel better. What's wrong? My blood pressure. I'll be right back. We both pretended to believe it was because we were too busy. Wasn't it? Is this an interrogation? If you like, I'll go for you. What do you mean? I'll go see your son. You'd do that? Yes. - You still haven't done it up. - No. I'm too busy. When I slept with you, it got me down. It still gets me down. Got what I asked for? - When will you be back? - When I've finished. I've got everything I need. Lena will be here soon. You're getting a move on at last! There's a story about a kid too. Is that enough? - Going with your new girlfriend? - What d'you mean? You're out of control, Mathieu. Maria Canalès! Are you spying on me? Jealous? Don't mix everything up. Get off my case! I'm free. Don't tell me what to do. What are you doing? You'll have your book. A juicy bestseller. That isn't what's worrying me. Yeah, well, everything's fine. I'll finish the book. And then I'll move on. Did you send Mathieu's gift? They must have his address. Ask the accounts department. - Will do. - It isn't rocket science. Get with the programme, Capucine. - Do you have his new number? - I'll try to find it. Talk to you later. ...the German Chancellor for an official visit. There will be a meeting and dinner with the foreign ministers of both countries. Fabulous, great! You give the impression you've always done it. But speak more slowly and end your sentences with more emphasis. They trail off. But otherwise it's great. Hello, sir. - Hello. - Hello. Mathieu Roussel. Yes. Mr Roussel. - A seaview room for one night? - Yes. Could I have some food? The restaurant opens at 7:30. But the bar will fix you a sandwich. The porter will take your bags up. - Hello, sir. - Room 27. Are you OK? Here, take this. Thank you. Does that happen often? Yes, but it doesn't last long. - We called the doctor. - There's no need. Hello. - Hi, Mum. - OK, Bruno? - That was fast. - I was nearby. What happened? I'm used to it. I'll check your blood pressure. Bruno, Loïc needs a hand in the restaurant. We're fixing you a sandwich. Will you be OK? Yes, thanks. Would you mind dropping me in town? No. I'm not supposed to ask, but I've got training. - Feeling better? - Yes, thanks. I've got a match tomorrow. Regional championships. Isn't it hard? The hardest thing is fighting your shadow. Been at the hotel long? A few months. I was studying agronomics and needed money. - What do you do? - I'm a writer. - Are you here to write? - To do research. One of my characters lives in Brittany. I came to see the sea too. Maria Answer it if you like. No, never when driving. Turn right here. Thanks a lot. Interested in boxing? I don't know much. Come to the fight. It's amateur, so don't expect Rocky. - I'll leave a ticket. - I might have left. We'll see. - Hello? - What's going on? He's in front of me. Blond. Pretty tall, slim. He has a dimple. On his left cheek. Have you taken a photo? Not yet. I'll send one soon. Take care. Yes. You take care too. Bye. I don't have much time. - The run-through's in a minute. - Sorry, I should've called. Have something to tell me? Something tough's happened. I don't know who else to talk to. Sorry. What's the matter? I have to go. What did you want to say? I wanted to say that tonight... No, never mind. Off you go. - Staying for the run-through? - Yes. You sound far away. - Where are you? - In Brazil. I don't believe you. Trying to be mysterious? See you tonight, I hope Bruno Hello? Could you get my bill ready? I'll be down in 5 minutes. Yes? They're beautiful. Mierda! Mierda! Mierda! I'm all emotional. Do you have another vase? On the fridge. I stopped in the foyer. I got really annoyed. They forgot to chill the champagne. The concierge gave me this for you. The cleaner found it in here. It's your friend's, isn't it? What's wrong? Press Pass Nothing, everything's fine. Turkey first, then the flooding. - Is that OK? - Fine. You're wearing that? Isn't it a bit solemn? No. Would you tell me if you knew anything? - Why are you asking? - You're such a bastard. It's her daughter Maria. She's on the set. We're starting in 5 minutes. Can't you disturb her? I'm afraid not. I can give her a message. No, thanks. I'll call later. Maria Defend yourself, dodge. And I let him come. If she can't handle it, she shouldn't come. Will you be OK, Mum? Don't you worry about me, darling. This amateur fight in three 3-minute rounds is a championship match. In the red corner, Bruno Trémasan. 20 years old, 63 kilos, 5 wins, one defeat. On air in ten seconds. Dim the lights. Four, five, six... Ladies and gentlemen, that's all for tonight. I'd like to take a moment to tell you I'm leaving. I'm presenting the news for the last time. The channel's management has decided to end our relationship. I won't have the pleasure of seeing you again. It's been a privilege and a real joy to share the news with you for the past 15 years. Stop! You were perfect. A big thank you to the team and all my loyal viewers. Take care. The show owes its success to the bonds we've forged together. They are unique, and cannot be undone. Ladies and gentleman, for the very last time, I wish you a good evening. Goodbye. The winner of tonight's fight is Bruno Trémasan! What showmanship. Too fake and sexy, she won't last a year. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Where'd you get it? I thought you'd send it to me. Watch out, there's a mole in the team. Good luck. Sorry. I sent the press release out at 8:30. The phone hasn't stopped ringing. Everyone wants you. Marchand called twice. There's a petition. Thank everyone, but my mind's made up. Your daughter called too. It sounded urgent. Maria. Maria. Everyone's waiting. That was a good fight. Mum! Mum! Stop. Hurt yourself? No... Well, a bit. You didn't go about it the right way. Look. Stand like this. Put your leg forward. That's it. Put your hands up like so. When you strike... Use all your weight. Congrats for the fight. Very impressive. Yeah, he got hurt. Want to celebrate with us? Sure. My punishment if I won was to sing you something. Seems I have no choice. You're being punished, in fact! My son, my child I see the time coming When you will leave me To change seasons To change homes To change habits I think of it every evening As I look and see Leaving me with the taste Your childhood breaking free Of a guitar chord You have travelled so much And I was often away From India to England We've travelled the world And not always together But at each return Our hands met On the velvety back Of a dog that loved us It was our way Of being good companions My child My little one Safe journey Safe journey You're taking the train For... life And your heart will change countries She called, she wanted to tell me something. She ran off after the show. I looked all over for her. She's stable. The blow to the head is more worrying. I have a few questions. Was she seeing a doctor? Is there a GP we could call? I don't know. Has she been on medication? Anti-anxiety pills. Lisanxia, for 18 months. But not anymore. Any surgery? A cartilage fracture last year. - Any allergies? - No. She's in an induced coma. It's the safest way to stabilise her vital functions. For how long? It's hard to say. We won't know for another few days. You can go see her now. I'm useless. I'm so, so sorry, my darling. Same again, please. It's cool you stayed. I wasn't sure. - What about? - That you'd like boxing. I was good tonight. Worked on your character? Yes, a bit. But I'm not sure I'll keep him. And you won't get very far playing on the beach. Nice pic I took of you, huh? Are your books about you? No. When I was young, I wrote one about me. But not anymore. You're still young. Yeah, you're right. I've changed, though. It does you good, eh? What? All this. Being here, drinking too much. And laughing too. You must have needed to. How do you know? At your age? It's got nothing to do with age. You've needed to for a while. Wait, Bruno. I can't, I'm not... It's OK. Say I took advantage of you. I'll bring it back tomorrow. When he smiles, he looks like you. See you in Quimper at 4:15. What do you know about the boy she met? He's an old friend, I think. - Does she see him a lot? - Yes. He does her good. Why? I don't believe it! What's the matter? The guy works for me! He's never mentioned Maria. He's not mentioned me to Maria either. It's... The football player was him too? But that's... He had access to my life, he came to my flat. I'm sorry. It's inconceivable! He used Maria. - I'll keep you posted. - Thanks, Olivier. Can you show him to me again? I twigged immediately. He looks like Miguel. She's been obsessed with him since her father died. She longs to meet him. I'll bring him back to her. Look after her. Lena Weber's Great Feat Good morning, sir. Breakfast? - What time is it? - Almost 4. Oh, shit! Bruno, you have to go. The croissants are bit dry, but I did my best. It's a gorgeous day. Make the most of the sunshine. Have you seen Névet Woods? I'll take you if you like. Tell me about your tattoos. Get out. Sorry, Bruno. We had a laugh. It can't be like this between us. Don't be a drag. It's OK. We hit it off. Let's not make a big deal of it. No. I made a huge mistake. You did nothing wrong. I've stuff to do. We can talk later. - Let's talk now. - No. I have a meeting. I'll explain when I get back. Mathieu. Your keys. Thanks. I'm pleased I met you. This is Quimper. The train terminates here. Would passengers please alight? Make sure you take all your belongings. You do look surprised. Can't piece things together? Must be tough not understanding! - Let me explain. - Go on. Maria asked me to come. I thought you hadn't seen her. - I ran into her. - Why didn't you say so? I have to help Maria. I'm expecting her. You gave her the big nostalgia trip, your mother's death! Did you faint too? It's unsettling, a man who passes out. Where is she? I want to talk to her. You can't. I've got some info for your trashy book! Maria got knocked down by a motorbike last night. You seem almost sad about it. Or is it because you need info? - Is it serious? - Going to sell it? - It's my job. - You call that a job! What did I do to make you so mad at us? What did we do to you? What did you do to my daughter? It's your fault. Bastard! What did I do to you? Why did you do it? Oh, shit! I didn't want it to be this way. Goodbye. Let me speak to him. Get lost! I don't give a damn about your book. Don't come anywhere near me, Maria or her son. Understood? - Has the guest in 27 left? - You're late. Did he pay his bill? Yes. He paid and left. Hello, Bruno. Can we talk? What can I get you? A beer. Do you know who I am? - Did you make him leave? - Who? Mathieu. You don't know him. He lied to you. He's done a lot of damage. He was here for himself. What about you? I told your daughter I wasn't interested. You can't smoke in here. You can't just rock up in people's lives! I don't belong to you. I'd just like you to meet her. It's what she wants most. I'd like you to come with me. Why should I? She can come here. She had an accident and is in a coma. That's just great! "Come meet your mum. You can't speak to her." Leave me alone! You can't leave her this way. You'll regret it. One day. People die every day. They have accidents. She abandoned me when it suited her. - She means nothing to me. - I won't give up. Is that a threat? You think you can do whatever you like. Go fuck yourself! I have decided, at the suggestion of the head of dance, to name Maria Canalès principal dancer. She's had an accident. It kind of sucks. I've always feared this moment. Ever since you arrived. That you would be torn away. I often wondered who they were, why they didn't want what was my greatest joy. But now I see her, I'm not afraid anymore. I've never wanted to know. Listen to me, son. You have to go meet her. You can't turn your back on this. It's how your life is. You have no choice. I'm asking you to. To thank me for raising you so well. I'm coming with you. I'm ready. We can leave when you like. There's a train at 3:30. Here's my address and phone number. Thank you. You should be going. - Coming? - We'll finish our coffee. Let's say goodbye here. Don't you mind people staring? I'm used to it. Does it bother you? Coming? Why didn't you come for me sooner? I didn't know you existed. She never told me. She was too ashamed, huh? No. It's just that we've never really spoken. You were never around. She said so in her letter. - Is she married? - She was. - Does she have other kids? - No. Promise not to see Mathieu again. He's a bastard. He took advantage of Maria, as well as of me and you. I took advantage of him. I forbid you to speak to him. I only met you yesterday, and you're forbidding stuff? I became a dancer because I didn't talk until I was 4. It was the perfect means of expression. There was the physical aspect too. A taxi is waiting to take us to the hospital. Yes, Judit. Yes. He's with me. She's woken up! We'll be there in 30 minutes. Bruno. Bruno! Bruno. I knew I'd find you here one day. But not so soon. It'll be OK, Bruno. I'm sorry I left. This flat is weird. It doesn't go with your tattoos. It was my mother's flat. Is that why you're sad? - Don't like my questions, huh? - No. You should answer. I don't want to be with her. You don't know her. I spent time with her. She can be bossy, but she's pretty amazing. - You'll get to know her. - Are you in love with her? She's brave too. She's been in the world's hotspots. She was a war correspondent in Vietnam. - There's a war there? - There was. I was kidding. Stay. Sleep. See you in the morning. Where are we going? You'll see. Don't be in a huff. We're here. You can get out. You're seeing your mum. Why are you doing this? I know you're scared. You have to do it, Bruno. That's why you came. I came to be with you. I'm not interested. I have my life, my job. There's no room for you. You're lying. Why are you talking crap? I want to stay with you. Stop this. Please. - What's changed since last night? - Nothing's changed. I just fed you and put you up. Now let me get on with my life. There's nothing in your life. Get out. Get out, please. I don't believe you. Go. Please go away. This is Bruno. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. You've reached Mathieu. Please leave a message. Mathieu, it's me. Listen... I know you don't want to talk to me, but I need to talk to you. I'm going home at the weekend. You're being really hard on me. Please call me back. She's ready. Could you bring the car round? Bruno. I'm sorry you're sad. Listen to me. I'm not going to hurt you. Listen to me. I'm sorry I lied to you. It's what I regret most. The first time I saw you, 10 years ago, I'd never seen anything so beautiful. When the show was over, I felt a huge emptiness. As if my life had stopped again. You didn't kiss me, I kissed you. And I've never forgotten that kiss. I just needed you to hear me out. I'm going to go now. I promise I'll never hurt you again. Goodbye, Maria.
