- Hi, I'm home. Lisa. Rusty. - How was New York? - Great. They want to use us. But they're looking for a new concept. Something more timeless, they say. Whatever that's got to do with tract housing. What the hell are you doing with that thing? - Protection. - Daddy. - Hi sweetheart. - Hi, welcome home. For me? You shouldn't have. - Actually, sugar, it's not. No this, this is what our house has been missing. - Gun rack? - My bright and cheerful son. Hey Rusty, I missed ya. - Well open it. - It's ugly as hell. I like it. - Come on, it's an antique. The guy who sold it to me told me it probably crossed the Atlantic on a schooner over Maybe on the Mayflower. - Oh Jake. And I bet he sold you Hitler's pencil box, too. - This will complete the scene. - Well, it's um-- - Creepy. - Unique. - I like it. It was practically free. It came from one of those houses we tore down for the development. Goodnight pumpkin. Goodnight, daddy. Rusty, sleep well. Whatever. - How's college? - Graduate school, there is a difference. - Yeah, about 10,000 bucks. I'm sorry, I'm a little giddy. Jet lag. Look, before you take off, I just want to thank you for coming over and taking care of my family. I know it was short notice, but there was nobody else. I couldn't miss that meeting. - Of course you couldn't, it's okay. God knows I've always loved this house. It was nice seeing your kids again. - They're all right, aren't they? - Yeah, yeah. You might spend a little more time with Rusty, though. He's alone a lot. - Rusty, he's a trooper. He'll be fine. How did you and Lisa get on? - Still tough. I mean, she misses her mother. I mean, that's not gonna change, right? Annette's not coming back. I can't compete with a dead woman. God, I'm here three days and it all comes back. Same feelings, same patterns. Jesus Christ. But we did talk about boys once though. For the record, his name is Andy. I think he plays lacrosse. That's all I could get out of her. - Listen to that. Are you sure you don't want to spend the night? - Jacob, we go through this every time. I mean, I hate having regret for breakfast. - No, the storm. That's all, I promise. Unless it gets real cold. - You know I'm seeing someone. - Leonard. We can invite him over, too. Leave in the morning, hm? It'll be a river out there. I'll be a gentleman. I promise. - Such theatrics, Jake. I'm impressed. - Variety. I got tired of trying to make the Earth move every time. Last night in my hotel room, I imagined you here in this bed. Like it used to be before you left. Oh. Don't get nostalgic on me, Jake, it doesn't become you. - You're so tough, aren't you? - It's because you're so dangerous. - Hm. You having doubts? Door's always open. Maybe I've changed. - I don't think so. I lived here for four years. Why should anything change? - I should've called you last night, but it was past three. - Three o'clock in the morning? - That damn clock. I had it in my hotel room. It's incredibly noisy. Of course, the harder I tried to sleep, the noisier it got, the louder the ticking got. God, I'm tired. - Jake. ♪ I'm talking about the young and the restless ♪ Young and the restless ♪ I want to be the young and the restless - Peaches. What're you doing out this late? There you go. Well excuse me. Picky, picky, picky. Shit. Come back here. Peaches? Peaches, come here. Peaches, come on. Peaches, come on. You scared me there, girl, come on. What are you doing in there? Come on. Go home, go home. Whoa. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Huh. - What are you doing down there? - Jesus, shit, Dad, you scared the crap out of me. - I said what are you doing down there? - Nothing. - Anything I can do? - No, we got it. Ride's here, let's go, Rusty. Bye, Dad! So long. - See you, Andrea. Are you gonna be here when we get home? - I'll call you next week, huh? Maybe we'll go shopping. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Come on. - Goodbye Rusty. Whatever. - It's all cleared up. It's gonna be a beautiful day. - Didn't you used to be able to see across the Anderson's yard? - Yeah, so the hedge has grown. Actually, it's about two feet over the neighborhood code. But it's not worth making a stink about. What time's your class? - Noon, I'll just leave from here. You don't mind? - Of course not. Make yourself at home. Tiny, Brooke, and Lynn, let's go. - Here Peaches, come here. - Peaches really should be on a lease, Mrs. Tetmann. High technology, you gotta love it. Uh! Dr. Knox to fourth floor nurses' station, please. Mrs. Sterling? - Actually I'm, yes, hi. - Well, he's suffered some discomfort but he'll be okay. Now our first concern is rabies. You said it was a neighborhood dog? - Yeah, Mrs. Tetmann, but I wasn't there, I mean, Jacob just came home and... - Yes, well I see, it's a good idea to double check. Now if this Mrs. Tetmann is in the slightest bit unsure about when that dog was vaccinated, her vet should have the records. Otherwise, we would need to begin the rabies shots immediately and nobody wants that, right? - No, no, of course not. Well maybe he should just stay here. - No, that won't be necessary. He'll be up on his feet soon. - How soon? - You're just gonna need to keep an eye on the wound, change the dressing every eight hours or so. - Yeah, okay. Well, is there anything else? - Well he may experience mild nausea due to the antibiotics, so careful what you feed him. Also, I've put him on Percodan for the pain. Mood swings are a common side effect. - Thank you. Okay. - Jesus, teen lust, it's really disgusting. Want a smoke? - No, I quit again. - Going to class? - Absolutely. Tomorrow. - Come to finish the game, Russell? - Shit. - Holiday? - Mental health day, your move, Iris. - Mate. My luck, I guess. - Iris, some strange shit happened last night. - I know. - You know, so what? - Depends, what did you see? - Well, it was kinda dark you know, but I think our living room turned into another room. It was old and decrepit, and then back again. - Oh, is that all? - Isn't that enough? - It fears you, it's trying to make friends, win you over. - So it, like what, like the devil? - No, this is the real thing. It's very old, and I think it's traveled a long way. - Why here, I mean, people in Burlwood, all things considered, it hardly seems worth the trouble. - It would only move for one reason. Where it was safe is no longer. It must find a new home. - I'll come around. - Are you okay? - Shit, Jake, why'd you have to go and do this? I've got so much work to do. I've got a paper due on Thursday. I was going out of town this weekend. - Well, no good deed goes unpunished. - Well isn't that the truth? Why does this remind me of our relationship? Me dropping everything for whatever you're doing? - What the hell do you want me to say? This wasn't planned. - Oh Jake, it's always been this way, and you know it. - So, is this your theory, or did Leonard work it out? He's a therapist, isn't he? - No, he's a psychiatrist. And for your information, I've always been quite capable of analyzing my own feelings. You just never listened, he does. Okay, this is it. I will stay a couple a days. I'll sleep on the couch or something, till you're back on your feet. But then I'm outta here Jake, and I'm not coming back, not even as a favor. - Oh, no! That hurts my eyes. Poor baby. Oh, honey. How does it feel? - I'm cold. - Oh, I, I have to clean it out. This might hurt a little bit, okay? - No! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No! Honey, the doctor says we have to keep it clean. - Give me that! Please. I'll do it by myself. Just leave me alone. - What're you doing here? Shouldn't you be in school? - Shouldn't you? - Look, Rusty, your dad had an accident. He's been bitten by a dog. - What? Dad? - Sh, just let him rest, okay? Now do you know this Mrs. Tetmann? Do you know where she lives? - Mrs. Tetmann, sure, she, Peaches? - Mrs. Tetmann, I'm Andrea, Jacob Sterling's friend. Uh, yes well, about today, I hope that Peaches is all right. Jacob said he cut her face pretty badly. Um, anyway, the doctors have urged me to check for rabies vaccinations. - What're you talking about? - Your dog Peaches bit Jacob. - Peaches doesn't bite. - With all due respect, Mrs. Tetmann, Jacob was viciously attacked. I mean, he only got away by slashing her face. - You're crazy. - Can we see her? Come here Peaches, come here honey. I don't understand, Jacob said he knew the dog. - Yeah, something's wrong. It's like that Skull Crusher song. Evil rules, it has the tools, but the world's your oyster, grab her and hoist her. - Save it, all right, this is not the time. - It's not just me, Mrs. Wheeler saw it too. - What, saw what? - Evil. - Evil. Oh, of course. Look Rusty, I think Mrs. Wheeler sees a lot of things coming that never arrive, all right? So let's just leave this weird stuff, this zombie, voodoo, metalhead view of the world alone for awhile, okay? Jake? Oh god. New concept. Timeless. Jacob? - Yeah, that's it. Timeless new concept. Bold, hm? Enigmatic, and bold. Much bigger than this, too. - Jacob, why are you up? - 370,000 square feet of modern living space artfully perched above the San Gabriel valley. With easy access to major shopping areas. Is this what my life has produced? Oh, you're running a fever. - Andrea. Are you gonna come back? - Come on, let me get you back in bed, all right? - These houses are too small. Too damn small. Think they'll have to put Peaches to sleep? - Well once a dog tastes blood, he wants more and more and-- - Rusty, what did we talk about? - What, any dog. Not just one who's possessed by a demonic force. - Enough. Lisa, where do you keep your phone book? - I don't know. - I'll get it. It's true though about dogs. This guy at school once brought a coroner's case book. And in it was how they found this old lady. She died a week before and no one knew, except for Poodle, who started gettin' hungry. By the time they found her, the little mutt had put on a few pounds, and the old lady had lost some, if you know what I mean. The thing that I keep thinking about is, when did the poodle decide to eat her? I mean, it's not the first thing he thought of. He must've sat around, expecting dinner as usual, and then said, "Fuck this, she's kibble, takin' a bite." Where do you think he started? - What happened to you? What? - You got up and walked out in the middle of dinner. I saved your plate, it's in the fridge. Thanks, I've been looking for this. Where'd you go? - They'll never believe me. - Dr. Leonard Stafford, please. Oh, it's Jacob, he was bitten by a dog. He was torn apart by a goddamn dog. It'll be at least a few days. Well honey, I'm sorry about this weekend. What? Me too. Bye. - Is that your boyfriend? Hubba, hubba. - Hubba, hubba, what's all that? - Oh, I'm gonna sleep on the couch tonight. You can have my bed. - That's very thoughtful, Lisa. - Yeah well, I figure you're old. We don't want your arthritis acting up. Oh god. - Andrea, when Dad gets better, you're leaving aren't you? - Oh honey, you know I love your dad. But there's things, you know, and choices that we made. Who knows if they're right or they're wrong, but I do know that we can't live together, not now. - I think it's a cop out. - Why? - Because, you and Dad didn't try hard enough. I don't know, maybe when you get older it just gets simpler to let things go rather than to fight for what you want. - Here I am treating you like a kid and you know a lot more than I did when I was your age. So, how's Anthony? - Andy. Oh, he's fine, I guess. He's got the most beautiful smile, and... - And what? What? - He's got the cutest butt on the entire campus, I swear to god. I wish I didn't feel like such a kid when I'm around him. I think he's got his eye on a senior. - Give it time. Where you going? Say goodnight to Dad. - Lisa, wait a minute. Here there, Princess. Hi Daddy. Well, you've looked worse. - When? - I'll get back to you on that. - Are you gonna go to the hospital? - No, the doctor says I'll be fine, right here, I just need a few days of rest. So for the next couple of days, I want you to be real nice to Andrea. - Mm. Off. Off switch. Okay. Oh. - Who is it? - Andrea. - Hm? - Can I sleep in here? My room's really creepy. - Sure honey, get your pillow, okay? - Hello? Dad, Andrea? Rusty! I'm stuck! Dad! Somebody open the door! I'm getting scared, open the! - You can turn the light on if you need to, honey. Sweet dreams, night. Lisa? Uh! Open the door! - Lisa? - Somebody open the door! Lisa! Open this door, please open this door! - Lisa! Oh baby, what happened? Huh? - Somebody locked the door. Who locked the door, Andrea? - Rusty. Where have you been, hm? - I went for a walk. - Oh, a walk. You went for a walk at three o'clock in the morning? - Yeah, I had to think about some things. - Oh well, I hope you figured 'em out. - Peaches. Peaches! Come on, girl, it's cold out here. Peaches? What did you get into? In this neighborhood a couple of years now with no incidents, this is just ridiculous. That woman there can help you. The man she's with, it's his son, it's his son. - Go talk to her. - Yes right across the street. Go talk to this woman. Do you believe this? - I don't know what to say? - That's terrible, what happened? - Mrs. Sterling, is your son at home? - Uh no, he's not my son, I'm Andrea Livingston. I'm staying with Mr. Sterling, but Rusty's not in. - Rusty, Rusty Sterling? - Yes, he's in school. You don't think Rusty had anything to do with-- - Uh, tell you what. Why don't you give us a call when he gets home, we'll make a special trip out here. Thank you, Miss Livingston. Oh, in time, time. No. - Jacob. Jacob honey, we need to talk. I think Rusty's in trouble. - No! Not right, not the right, not the right concept. Timeless. Aren't you gone yet, hm? - Jacob, I'm talking to you. I'm gonna call the doctor. No! I feel fine. I'm a little under the weather, huh? Perhaps not up to speed. But I've got work to do and you're not helping me. I'm facing a deadline. Nice. Timeless. - You know Rusty, I gotta tell you, we don't get a lot of calls like this up here in Burlwood. And with the high school just a couple blocks away well, it seems pretty cut and dry, you know. Then I was thinking, you know, you're a sharp kid, you come from a nice family, maybe you've got some not so nice friends. And if they were doin' somethin' like this, you'd know about it. - I don't know everything they do. I don't know everything anybody does. - So how can you be sure they didn't do it, huh? - I didn't say they didn't, I said they wouldn't. Now we're gonna find out what happened. If not from you, from one of your buddies, and where's that gonna leave you? - So let's have it. - Rusty, for god sakes. Yeah. Whoa. Hi. - Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. Let me just hold you. - No, oh my god, I'm sorry. I guess I've just been holding all this inside. It's really silly. - No, it's not, now you just let that out. That's what I'm here for, huh. What is this? - This is fine wine, this is fine takeout, I thought we'd have a picnic. - A picnic? - Picnic. - So, did you bring egg rolls? Yeah, of course. - Good. - The food is delicious. - Rusty? Rusty. Rusty. Rusty! Um, this is my friend, Leonard. - Call me Lenny, hi. - Nice shoes, Lenny. - Um, how 'bout some dinner, hm? Leonard brought some Chinese food. - Laotian, actually. - I'll order a pizza. - Okay. - Sure. Uh, it's nice meeting you there, Rusty, and, Rusty, right, I hope that later on we can open up a little dialogue, okay? - Oh, Jacob, you remember Leonard. He teaches at the university. - Yeah, I heard about your leg, I'm uh, geez uh, that's pretty bad. You know, if it's painful I might have something for you. Andrea tells me that you don't wanna see a doctor. I really think that you should. I'm a doctor myself and I really think that you uh, you should have that looked into. - Uh, Jacob, why don't you let me help you with that? Come on, let's go. - There's a lot of hostility there. You wanna know what I think? Yeah, I guess I'm ready for it. - I think that your skin is so soft and smooth and warm-- - It's the porch lighting. - You're caught in the middle of a classic interdependent destructive relationship. - Is that right? - Um-hm, upstairs in the hallway, the way he played you, it's perfectly choreographed. Look, on one side there's Jake, he's a disabled former lover. Then there's you, you're soft, you're warm, you're bright, you're fresh. But you're still carrying a burden of guilt from the breakup. Now he needs you, he needs you. But he denies all your efforts, and he struggles nobly against these obstacles, which he sets up for himself. He feeds himself with our sympathy, he nourishes himself with your guilt. And in the end, he makes it look like he's doing all this for you. - Leonard, he was seriously hurt by that dog. - Was he? You yourself said that he lied about ever cutting the dog's nose, and that woman denied that it ever even happened. - You don't think he could've done that to himself? Oh, god. You always see so clearly. - Is that good or bad? - No sweetie, it's wonderful. I knew it from the moment we met. It's just that-- - What? - Last night, what about that? I mean, it wasn't a dream. There was something in my bed, I felt it. I turned the light on and-- - It wasn't there. It's stress, it's a classic stress-related syndrome. You know, the subconscious has a very powerful affect, not on reality, but on perception. Now Andrea, I was not thrilled about you coming to babysit for this guy in the first place, and now you're simply being drawn deeper and deeper into his world. I know the pain that you've been through, I love you. I don't wanna see you go through this anymore, please. - He scares me, Leonard. - Is he violent, is he violent? - No. Not yet. - All right, I will tell you what, there's a Dr. Grover, he's an old friend of my father's, he works in the psychiatric ward, if there's any other trouble I will have Jake admitted like that. Okay, no problem, he's a friend of mine, no records. - Oh god, everything's gonna be all right. Mm. - Mm. Of course. - Seconds walk, minutes run, years fly, decades stun. It's true. - What time is it? - I don't know, my watch is stopped. - Oh my god. - Andrea, Andrea wait! - No, please god, no. - Andrea. Wait! All the fire's out. - Mr. Anderson, what happened? - The hedges caught fire. I gotta say, I don't see how, what with all the rain lately. Here, take this. Careful there, Mickey. Come on, get a little more. - Guess we, we were pretty lucky, it could've been a lot worse. - Lucky? Yeah. Lucky the neighborhood didn't get torched. - So how's Mr. Sterling doing? - Um, he's, he's better, slowly, takes time. - Well this oughta cheer him up a bit. Hedges are well below code now, huh? Give me that, Mickey. - Oh my god. - What, no goodnight kiss? - Uh, just hang on, I think my house is burning. What happened? - Where's your brother? - I don't know, I just got here. - What's up? - What the hell do you mean, what's up? This house almost burned down. - What can I say, I've been here all night. - All night? - I took a piss around 7:45, I'm sorry I didn't call you. - Look Rusty, somethin' is goin' on here. - That's what I'm trying to tell you but you don't listen. It's an evil force. - The only evil force in this house is you. - That's what it wants you to think. - Stop it. You know, you are headed for real trouble here. - You have a pyromaniacal Nazi down the hall. You've got a toxic lunatic in the master bedroom. They only one around here who seems normal is Lisa, and that's because I have not met her yet. I wonder what kind of secrets she has in her closet. You know, Barbie doll vivisection, Pagan rituals. - Oh god, stop it. - Isn't there an aunt somewhere, or like a grandmother who could take over for you here? You've done enough, you've done enough. - You don't understand, this was my home, I used to live here. - That's right, you used to, you used to, no more. I'm sorry, I don't mean to yell, I don't yell. How much more can you take? - They were almost my family. - See, you still love him, you still love him. - Oh, no Leonard, I don't, you know that's not true. - You want him back? Maybe, because you dumped him, the only way you can rationalize being with him now is not as a lover, but as a mother. - Oh my god, this isn't fair, Doctor. - Well you tell me I'm wrong, you tell me I'm wrong. - You're wrong. - I'm wrong? And Quasimodo's still asleep? - Mm-hmm. - I'm wrong. Right, the master makes it work, finally. Yes. The right concept. - Ah. - High technology, you gotta love it. Put it here, pal. Good firm grip. You play squash? Look, I just wanna take a second here and let you know how much I appreciate your coming over and taking care of my family. God knows, I've been in no shape to do it. I owe you one, buddy. So, you're a doctor, right? - Yeah, I'm a psychiatrist. - A doctor, sick is sick, right? Whether it's upstairs, or down in the basement. Did I tell you I went to med school? Almost. - Ah no, you didn't. - You bet, but I ended up studying drafting, majored in architecture. And I build things, lots of things. But sometimes Doc, I gotta tell ya, don't think I'm weird, sometimes I get the urge to tear them down. Just get ahold of a wrecking ball and level blocks and blocks of ranch-style homes. - You don't say. - You must experience a similar thing. I mean, you spend all day just healing people, making them feel better. Don't you ever wanna hurt 'em? Make them bleed, balance the books, clean the slate. Relax. Take a look at this puppy. It's a Walther P38K. Actually quite old, worth a lot. German construction. The SS used to carry these. Some of the Berlin police still use 'em today. Although they're actually being replaced by more sophisticated sidearms. It's a terrific piece of machinery, incredibly accurate. It never jams. It's just a work of art to look at. But I guess its day has passed. I'll tell you one thing though, you turn this puppy on some asshole and you can slip your wrist through the hole it'll leave behind. Are you fucking Andrea, my Andrea? Don't lie to me, you bastard fornicator. - What're you talking about? Look, you guys have a relationship, okay, I'm not part of that. - And what about tonight? Are you going to fuck her? Here, in my house? - No. - Bend her over the dresser just down the hall from where we used to sleep together? - No, no, no. - You fucked her. - No. - Don't lie to me. - Yes, uh, yes, I did it, okay? - And what about after? - What? - Lisa, are you going after my daughter? - Never, I would never. - I can't let you do that. I gotta stop you, right here, right now. - No, no! No! - Lenny? - Ah! Oh, oh. - What is going on here? - Oh, oh, oh. - Mm. - So where's Leonard? - Well, he just couldn't wait to get to work. Rusty, um, yesterday you said there was evil here. - Yeah. - Well what have you seen? - Strange shit. Couple nights ago, Mrs. Wheeler said she saw it too. - What? - There's no sense in looking for it. It's not like ghosts and demons and shit. See, I think it's inside of us, it's in everything. It's trying to make this house its home. See that's why I don't need a heart-to-heart with your psychiatrist friend, and why the doctors can't help Dad. He's suffering up there because of what’s in this house. We need to get out. - Well, I think you believe that, but I just can't. - Hello. - Morning. - Lisa, don't you think you'll be cold today? - Uh, no, I borrowed Dad's jacket. Think he'll mind? - Not. - Sweetie. - What? - I don't want you goin' out like that. - Andrea, you're not my mother. Oh, uh, I'm gonna be going out with Andy again tonight. Don't wait up. - Oh, so many questions, sit down, Rusty. The first night, you said there was a room. - Yeah, an old and musty room but I haven't seen it since. - Take me through this room. - I didn't go in it. - Describe it, it's important. It's all we have right now. Come on Rusty, you can do it, concentrate. Close your eyes. All right. All right it was, it was weird. It was dark. There was uh, cloth, uh, pictures made of cloth. - Tapestries. - Right. On the walls, and candles, black candles. There was a, a thick wood table, like a butcher's block, in the center. And, there was knives and like saws. There was something carved on the table, like a, a symbol. - Pentagram. - How did you know? - Go on, go on. - Um, there were, manacles and chains and, oh god, it's to hold someone down on the table. It, it's small, it's too small. - It was for children. - What? Have you ever seen this picture before? - That's it, that's the room I saw. - You've never seen this picture before? It is rather famous. That room belonged to Gilles de Rais. - But that's the room I saw, I swear. - Oh, and I believe you. And I think you may have been looking back in time. France, 15th century, de Rais ran a school for boys. He was a teacher, minister, inventor, and necromanser. - A what? - Oh, it's French. It means eater of the dead. You see, de Rais had a habit of choosing some of the best and brightest from his classes, and eating them. - Should I ask why? - Poor fool thought that by eating their flesh he would gain their youth and therefore become immortal. - Okay, so what does it mean? - Don't rush to understand Rusty, just listen and feel. It began the night your father returned from where? - Back east. His company was breaking ground on a new development. - Where? - New York, Long Island, actually. I think it's called Amitysville, Amitysville Manor or some shit. - Amityville. - Yeah. So, what? - I don't know. At least I don't think I know, I, go home, I have to work this through. - Rusty. Andrea. - Get in, school called, in. Now. Why don't you stop trying to be my mother for a minute. Gladly, soon as your father wakes up, he can take over. I've had as much patience as I can. Now go upstairs, all right. No calls, no TV, and no discussions. - What are you? A gift. - Hello. No, I'm sorry, Rusty can't come to the phone right now. Yes, I'm sure it is important, Mrs. Wheeler. No, I'll tell him you called. - Hello Mrs. Thompson, how you doing? Here are your diapers. Now we can set the date for the last two weeks. Just call me, I'll be here, any time you want me, I'll be here for you. That's what you need, that's what you get. Hey, stop that truck! - Someone help me! Somebody help! Help me! Son of a bitch. Oh! - Are you okay? - Just leave me be, I'll be fine. - I'm really sorry, I am, I, I gotta radio this in. - Hello? Anybody there? Iris? Hello? Hello? Iris? Iris? Hello? Bingo. The name again is Sterling, Russell. Aliases include Rusty. - Time for another chat, Rusty. - Damn! Turn away please, people. Yeah, she's gone, she's gone. Really, a bit crazy. Iris! You got her strapped down? All right. Iris! All right. All right. Iris! - Jacob. Jake. Jacob. Jacob. Yes, Dr. Grover, please, this is Andrea Livingston. Yes, tell him that Dr. Spears referred me. Yes, this is an emergency! Oh! - Yes Andrea. - No Jacob, no, you're sick. Ah, you're-- - You don't know how sick. Oh! - No, no! - What? Let's get outta here. - Okay, okay, okay. Come on let go, let go. - Oh no, no. - Come on, come on, I'm here, I'm here, come here. I'm convinced we've got a medical problem. What the hell is this for? - Thorazine, your fella here is gonna go to dreamland for a day or two. - Is it dangerous? - I hope so. No, no, he'll be fine. He's just gonna sleep, god knows he can use it. And Grover's told me that medical transport's on the way over, and by god if I have to forge the documents myself, he's gonna go get taken care of, okay? Come on. Come on, that's right. - I don't care. - I thought I'd park here so your dad doesn't see us. - You're a smart guy. No, no, no. - I knew it, I knew this was just too good to be true. - Patience, baby, patience. We're gonna play a little game. Hansel and Gretel. Close your eyes. Count to 10, and follow the trail. - I like this game. - Good. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Oh, yes. Andy. Ah. Oh, thank you. Lisa. Lisa, are you down here? - Why don't you come down and find out? You did very well, Andy. Oh, Lisa, I like this game. - Now I want you to wait right there till I give you the signal. - Lisa, you're giving me nothing but signals. I want you now. - Don't come any closer, not yet. You could be a gentleman though and toss me your jacket. Varsity, right? You ready for the big leagues? Why don't you take off the rest of your clothes? - Oh Lisa, I can't take it anymore. - Choo-choo, all aboard. - You won't regret this, I swear. - You might. - Oh, what did I step in, a storm drain? Hey, what the fuck? I'm sinking. Lisa, Lisa help me. Oh god it burns, oh! Oh my god, it burns, it's burning me, Lisa! Help me, help me, you bitch! - Bye, Andy. Bye. Bye. First time not so bad after all. - Leonard? Hey, what's wrong? - Sh, sh, sh. The water. - What? - Sh, blood. - What're you talking about? - Sh, there's somebody here. - Are you sure? - Yes, I can only rely on the evidence, but judging from it, I would conclude that I've lost my mind. Now is he asleep? - Yeah, he's out like a light. What the hell is goin' on here? - Well somehow Jacob is behind all this. Now I don't know if it's a case of parapsychological projection, where he's creating this with the raging forces inside of him, or if he's doing it all with mirrors, I don't care. Where the hell is the ambulance that I called for? Naturally, it's dead, it's dead. All right, the car, I got a phone in the car. I want us outta here, I want him outta here. Okay, I gotta make this phone call. You just get everyone together in the living room. Hey. - You must be Lisa. - Hurry back. - Lisa, are you all right? - Yeah, I think I'm in love. Excuse me, I'm gonna change. Is Daddy up and around yet? - Oh god. Oh god. Oh my god. Oh God. Leonard. Jake? Jake, is that you? Jacob, I really wanna help you. I do, really. Jacob. Rusty. - Sh, where is he? - I don't know, I don't know. Leonard's dead. - So is Mrs. Wheeler. - What? - How did it get this far? - What, what is happening? - It's the clock, it makes people evil. It got Dad, I think it got Lisa, where is she? - How could a clock do something? - Sh, it's not any clock. This clock, where it's been, you have to trust me. We have to get outta here. Okay? You listening? Uh! Oh-oh. - It's Lisa, get out. - Rusty. Lisa? Lisa? Rusty. Thank god. - Until last week I'd never taken a single call from Burlwood. - What'd I tell you? We should never have let that Sterling kid go home. Lisa? Oh god, it's so horrible. Lisa, you okay? Rusty, it's so horrible. We gotta get the hell outta here. It's so horrible. What is? - That you're my brother. ♪ Don't care about the young and the restless - It's pretty quiet, huh? Help me! Goddammit, can you hear? Goddammit, open the door! - Open it! No, the door! Open the fucking door! Nobody home? - Another action-packed night in Burlwood. No! What in the hell is happening here? It's got nothing to do with hell, Andrea. - Oh. - Heaven and hell. Purgatory, limbo. Myopic, Andrea. Such a small view of the world. This is about power, power and sacrifice. I love you. No, no, no, oh, oh. Oh! - I felt your eyes on me for the longest time. - Oh yeah, feel this. - Mm, I like that. Will you spank me too, I've been real bad. Come on, Rusty, just give me a little kiss. Pucker up, this could be your last chance. - Jacob, this isn't you. Please, this isn't you. That's it, that's it. It's Andrea, that's it, baby. - Hold still. - They come. Stop! - Rusty! - My life is a mess, Andrea. And you ruined it! - No! - My bright and cheerful son. No! - What time, what time? The clock, I need more time. Stay the night. I'll be a gentleman, I promise. - Rusty? Oh baby, come here. That's it, come on, come on, baby, yeah. Go wait outside, okay. Mommy'll be right out. He will get out, understood? It's time. Oh my god. - Hi! I'm home, Lisa, Rusty. They asleep? - How was New York? - It was great, they wanna use us. They're looking for a new concept, something more timeless, they say. Whatever that means in tract housing. What the hell you doin' with that? - Protection. - Daddy. Hi, sweetheart. - Hi, welcome home. For me, you shouldn't have. - Actually sugar, it's not. No this, this is something that our house has been missing. - A gun rack? - Oh, my bright and cheerful son. - Well, open it. - Not again! No! - What the hell was that all about? - It's about time, that's what. - Pure evil.
