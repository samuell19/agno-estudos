Do you like mangoes? Tell me who doesn't? When summer sets in for 3 months they reign supreme! Mangoes are just like humans, they grow into different sizes, different shapes and different varieties. At first, they are raw then ripen and finally decay. Who knows? Maybe in their lifetime they aspire to become a pickle, fruit essence, juice, or… Give it all up And aspire to go overseas and become a fruit jam, right? But… Only fate decides what will happen! Misfortune may make someone throw a stone at it, or pluck them to make lemon-rice, or hastily fall off the trees themselves! Does that mean its story ends there? No... The story goes on! If God permits, even a raw mango that falls off a tree can turn into a pickle. If it tries a little more It can turn into 'Aachar & Co’ Pickles as well! In front of Kausalya provision store, The rooster crowed Another night has passed And Bangalore saw dawn! Chikpete, Dodpete, Market, Jayanagar, Malleswaram! People jaunting everywhere… That became the fate of Bangalore! Married women woke up, Bathed at dawn And wore holy clothes. Having washed the front door, Drawing rangoli patterns, They circumvented the holy basil pedestal. Paying obeisance to their family deity in their mind, Lit the holy lamp on the auspicious salver. By the time this worship ritual was completed, For how long will you sleep girls!? The time was 7. Wake up girls! Sister! Wake up guys! Wake up guys! Mother! Lazy bums! Rubbing their eyes, The children of the house woke up then. Lift your legs man! Queued up in front of the bathroom So that they get their turn Go! For Bangalore’s cold weather The hot water bath Come back! Would not get over in a hurry! If the house is filled with people, This is an everyday cycle! While reading the paper Aachar has to drink Coffee… Aachar has to drink I'll get it, I'll get it. Sugarless coffee. Take this. Unfortunately today The milkman arrived late! Milked from the udder, Filled in the can by the divine cow! Till that time let us see What is the recent news! Our government does what it says, Said B. D. Jatthi. Bifurcation of the state… For the people in the border areas Is like a sword hanging over the heads! To restore the relationship with China A new strategy is being adopted! When will this country become A formidable global power? The Ambassador car parked in front of the house Is the talk of the city! What a nice car! Yes, yes! Neighbors’ envy, owner’s pride! And what is there for breakfast today? Everybody is eyeing it. If the horn blares three or four times What a big car! It means it is getting late. Go away! It means it is getting late. Where’s my tape? It means it is getting late. The breakfast is getting cold! Come! Who else is left! Move! I will finish this… Mother, my shirt is not dry! Ode to the new morning! Everyone’s lunch boxes… Move! Jaggu, give it! Ode to the new morning! I’m done brother... You go! Mother! Coffee! The procession has started! Inside the ambassador, sitting like the anointed Lord is Madhusudhan Aachar. Even though he's not looking back, the lady incessantly waving at him is his wife Savitri. They both have 10 kids. Their intention is to not spoil the kids by taking them in the car so early on. By the way, not like they’d all fit in any way! This is Sudheendra, the first son. He had earnestly promised to become an engineer just like his dad… He is now regretting his fate! This is Raghu, the second son. He has big dreams in life! He might be dreaming now too... Let’s not disturb him. Come, come! This is Sheela, the second daughter… One minute! Did you ask where the first daughter is? She had come of age. Who keeps a 16-year-old at home?! They got her married! The one with his finger up his nose, looking at the sky and walking… That is Jaggu. The one grumpy about the mismatched hair ribbons is Suma. The one with a spring in her step is Uma. These two are Leela and Gowri. Don’t ask who Leela is and who is Gowri! 3 boys, 6 girls, someone is missing! This is the last daughter Vijaya. In the entire family, she is the only one studying in English medium Get lost you complaining goose! Don’t act smart! I will tell mother, wait! I’ll tell father, look! Look father, what he’s doing! Tata! He’s hitting me! Bye, bye! Bye, bye! Keep quiet! Bye! Bye sister! Tata! Bye! Bye! Go in! What’s the first class? I'll complain to mother. Tata! You’ll get late for class! Go in! Bye! Okay, bye! Tata! Tata! Tata! Madhusudhan Aachar is a civil engineer. The car, bungalow, telephone, house helps, and all the amenities are all thanks to this job! Government’s work is God’s work. Brother! Be quiet! She will come! Brother, do you know what is happening in college? - I’m getting hungry! How long! When will mother give us food? Today… The idlis in the box had disintegrated and had become Uppit. If you keep failing, that's what you'll get! - All of you are already seated! At least I attend class, unlike you… Keep quiet! Mother? Is it lemon-rice! Oh! No! Mother has cooked today! Who has the snack cupboard key? She had given it to Thimma to get sugar. Take the fritter! Was dinner good? Kamala didn’t come today, her mother has died for the third time! She forgets what excuses she has given in every house! Is Jagadeesh… Studying at home? Why? He is studying. His marks don't say so! Horlicks! Horlicks! What if his marks are low? He's a sharp boy… Will he get an engineering seat just because he's sharp? He needs higher marks! Our Raghu is studying engineering, right… Then why worry! Let him complete it, then we'll talk! It's not like it’s the only job! Our Sudhi has got a govt job, right? Isn’t that enough? Yes… In the Survey Department! Is that even a job?! Who'll get their girls married to these boys!? Whatever I say, you have a retort ready! Looks like Aachar didn't know this, But marriages weren't just between the boy and girl, it was between their families. The bride's families had their eyes on Madhusudhan, on his house, on his job, on that green Ambassador car! That’s why, as soon as BBC broadcasted about Sudheendra’s new job... What Seenanna? Have you come regarding another money scheme? Which one? Life insurance scheme? What are you saying Aachar? I’ve come with a life settling scheme! Come, I’ll tell you. Mother! Mother! Seenanna has come, give me the snack cupboard key! Thimma! Yes, I’m coming! I'm standing right here! Give it to me… Seenanna has come, Bring four biscuits and coffee. Don't forget to lock the cupboard. Thimma, just two biscuits… I won’t tell anyone, at least give me fritters! Fine… At least a spoon of milk powder!? Father, heard you called me? Sudheendra is here! Our crown prince! Are you fine? I'm… I’m good. You have left your cycle outside! What if someone steals it? Utterly irresponsible! Let it be there! No one will take it! You come here! Sit! Come here son! Sit here! Come here son! Come! Sit here… Sit next to me! Come here! Come here! Come here! Come closer! Sit properly! Congratulations my son! I heard you got a government job. It made me very happy! It’s all my dad's blessings… I blessed you… To become an engineer! You should be satisfied with what you get, Mr. Aachar... Anyway, Regarding the topic we discussed… Did you ask your son? What's there to ask him? We have all agreed! Same city, same caste, what more is needed? Let’s blow the wedding trumpet! Good, good! Congrats my son! Let's shake on it! My niece Parimala, she is a precious gift! You’ve hit the jackpot! Wherever you look in Bangalore, you won’t find such a good girl! Let’s tell the priest to set a good date and get them married! What do you say? Sure, what’s there to it! Yes… That is fine! Wedding? So soon? That's how it used to be then… When old folks wanted a get-together, they used to get the young ones married. You are looking so handsome! Mother… You… Have you seen the girl? No, I've been busy since morning. Not like that mother... I meant, how does she look? Why? She's as beautiful as Seenanna said. Mother… Didn’t father see you before you got married? Your dad? As soon as our wedding was fixed, He kept cycling around my house! Father?? Yes! Don't tell him I told you this. Then he’ll get very angry! Jaggu, send coffee for the priest! What is this? Both of you are standing here and spinning yarns! No father… Sudhi was asking… No, no, I was not asking anything father! What? He’s asking how the girl looks! She is better looking than you! This generation is in a hurry! Even after two weeks of the wedding… I hadn't even turned to look at your mother! Ask her and check! Did you know? Really! Fine, fine! Come, come! Go and bring them! Come quickly! Come quickly! Can you see her? No! Whoever throws the jaggery and cumin seeds first… They will rule the house! Just cause the boy looks good, don't get spell bound! You throw it fast! Brother, don't lose your senses looking at her! You have to be first! Throw it! Throw it quickly! Even then boys wished for a partner like Madhubala, and the girls wished for a partner like Dev Anand… Still, you had to make do with whoever you got! Whatever you say, Parimala is very lucky! At Aachar’s house, there is house help to sweep, to wash and for everything. She can live like a queen! Did you notice Veena's daughter? Oh! God! Who invited her? How can she come even if she is invited? What a bad omen! But when I see her, I feel pity for her. True… Living alone without a husband is really difficult! I heard that she only asked for the divorce! Really? Yes! Really? Oh! God! Did you recognize them? I mentioned the BBC earlier, right!? It is them. Bharathi, Bhagirathi, Chandravathi… Even though their tongues belong to them, they gossip about others! They come to all festivities like weddings, etc., to give in to the thirst of their tongues! At every good occasion the Aachar’s celebrate, they are present! This is just the beginning, there are a lot more weddings for you to see! What? A sales boy! Not a sales boy, father… My son is going to be a sales boy?! A sales representative! They are one and the same! Who gave you the permission to join? Don’t I have the freedom to choose my career?! It's been 15 years since the Britishers left! How much more freedom do you want? Father, I don't like engineering! Even I don't like engineering, neither does he! No one does! But someone has to do it! Give it here! Engineering got me this car. If you don’t want to study engineering, You don’t need this car either. Go! Father, how will I come? Get going! Do whatever you want! Father! What did you bring? Show me! I brought… A vermillion holder! What is this? This engraved K S Rao is so small! The shopkeeper said there isn't enough space to write a saga! You have a lot to learn. Look here… ‘Hagaribommanahalli Kodandaramiah and family, Jayanagar, Bengaluru… 01-03-1963!’ As if she's going to take steel utensils to the US? Look how beautiful she is! Like an ivory doll. For her this is perfect! Not like a doll! She looks like an owl! She’s your sister! Her saree looks like a tent! Watch me! Watch how I will look at my wedding! For your wedding, I don’t know if I’ll be there… Why? I’ll get married earlier and go to Singapore! Singapore? I'll go to London, wait and watch! I've only paid for everything! Go and sprinkle a little on others too! You got it? Why the urgency? Slow down! He’ll become a sales boy; I believe! A sales boy! Who? Who else? He is born to ruin my reputation! Father! Father, come quickly… Our reputation is at stake! Only you were left! Not me father, you come! Look Mr. Aachar, we did not take dowry like others! At least treat the groom's side properly! Why, is something missing? I gave the watch, ring and suit you wanted, what is it Lokesh? Is everything all right? Is it enough to look after the groom alone? Then? We had… We had said that everyone from our side should be welcomed with a sandalwood garland, right? We couldn't find so many garlands in the last minute… Maybe during lunch, we can give them marigold flowers… No… We’ll give them rose flowers only… Why? To look like fools? I will arrange for all that. The auspicious time will pass, please come. By the way… Another thing. For lunch, how many sweets are being prepared? Three! Including kheer or excluding it? Including it! Come… What is this father? They said so much and you did not even give it back?! If I had retorted, they would have cancelled the wedding and left! If so, then let them father! What if they ill-treat Sheela tomorrow and ask her to leave the house? Raghu, you're still young, be quiet! Like you're still very mature! Look at him! Go! Go! Look after the work! Did you need this? As if he honored you! The nuptial tune, play it! Look at the laddoo It’s as small as a marble that kids play with! To send his daughter to America, shouldn’t he save up money? Still to get married in Andal hall and then go to America… Not everyone is that lucky. They haven't put salt in the salad! Yes. Did you hear about Raghu? Yeah, he's going to become a salesman, it seems? That's old news. Do you know what Jaggu is up to now? What Jaggu was up to, no one knew in his own house. But the BBC knew! Thus, certain things are more credible coming from them rather than me! Come down… Oh! Damsel! Cheers! Sir, can I sit down? Leelavathi is a real sight to behold! Rajkumar looks like a real prince. What amazing acting dude! Jaggu, you’re no less man, you could become an actor, just like him! It's not written in my fate to be an actor! Even if it was, my dad has rewritten it to make me an engineer! Really? I can't see anything dude! Become an actor first man, then you can act like a doctor and an engineer! Yes dude! Remember that school play you acted in? Where that girl dies! Romeo Juliet. That very same one! Isn’t it? Romeo Juliet guys! - He drinks the poison and then she too dies. I mean, it was some family caste problem. That same one! It wasn't a caste problem… Which one is that? I got it! Romeo Juliet! Yes! Correct! That one only! Romeo Juliet. Do you remember it, Jaggu? I remember! And I also remember failing in that year’s exam! I thought my dad was going to kill me. Next time let’s write a play about how your father kills you. It's a joke to you guys. Look Jaggu… This studying and writing is for idiots like us only. Isn't Rajkumar so knowledgeable even though he did not study? Mark my words, one day or the other they will give him a doctorate! Guys! It’s really late, my dad's really gonna kill me! Bye… Jaggu, come back! Jaggu, come back! He’s done for! Father! No father! That… Is this why I pay and send you to college? My friends… Are all your friends like this? No father, they don't go below 90 at all. 30 itself is a lot for me! What? Only 30? Aren't you ashamed? You have to take more than 90 henceforth! 90!? Father, my head spins with just this much… Idiot, studying makes your head spin? You have to study engineering! Oh! Got it father! I'll do better next time. What's that smell? Where are you coming from? Smell? Where is that emanating from? Where is that emanating from? Brother is here! Father, what happened? First bring your cycle inside. Fine father. If you keep failing your exams... You're going to fail in life also just like him! Suma also fails… None of you say anything to her! She's a girl, no one's gonna ask what she's studied… But you have to study engineering! I'll do a diploma! What a fate! One wants a diploma! Another is a sales boy! Father! Sales Representative! Put up a board saying so! Then people will realize! We have to get such morons married! God knows who will give a girl! My fate! They found a girl… And the wedding was also fixed! Are you drunk? But what Aachar was angry about was not that! Father! The fact that he has found a girl is itself great! In that too… Lower your voice please! People have come. When that is the case, what was the need for him to see the girl before the wedding?! What happened now? He has agreed, hasn’t he? Why should he check? Isn't it enough if I approve the match? Don't I know? I have 10 children! What everyone wants, do I not know? Even I know, not just you. I only gave birth. Is it your wedding or your brother’s wedding? They’re all calling you Come! Come quickly! Go! Go! What were you doing inside? Go! Brother? Yes? Look for it quickly! Gently! Brother did you not get it? I’ll only look for it! Wait my dear! There is still time for you! Not that fast! Quickly! Brother! Quickly! Brother, we have to win! Be careful of the hand! Seems like super fun, right? You did this in your wedding too, right? Wait and watch... Just like brother, I’ll see my wife before the wedding and only then get married. Whom do you think will win? But make sure you don’t show your face Jaggu. Brother is gonna win for sure, watch out! As if you're an enchanting beauty! Yes, just wait and watch the groom I’ll marry, Did you find it? London… I will go to London and live in a huge bungalow! As a maid? Stop it! See her mother! Fighting in front of everyone… Brother you only have to find the ring! Sit back! Sit properly! Move! The house suddenly started feeling cramped. It is true that filled pots are stable but if it is heavy, it must be emptied to another vessel. Brother Jaggu… Brother!! The pillow! Was there a need to teach Raghu that, tell me?! Father… Father! What is it? I'm getting late for work. I've seen a house in Basavanagudi, for Rukmini and me. Why? What's lacking for you here? Space! When I’m leaving for the office, why do they bring me such news? Stupid fellows! Get moving! A little… Come this side! Move a little! Move please! Slowly! I’m telling you only! Come this side! To move a few new tables and chairs, how much time will you take? Sir, we are planning in such a way that everyone benefits from the fan. Plan all this instead of the dam project! Take this! Correct it and come! Go! Get out! Hello! Hello, is this Mr. Madhusudhan? Yes, it’s me. Are you Jagadeesh’s father? Yes, I am Jagadeesh’s father. This is the college principal. Yes. Tell me principal sir! Your son has not been coming to class since long! Really? Yes! He hasn’t been seen here! He hasn't been coming to college? Yes sir! But… I drop him at the college gate myself every day! Talk to your son! Talk some sense into him! Okay. It’s your fees that is going to waste! Okay. I’ll talk to him sir. Please do! Okay. Greetings. Greetings. What are you doing here? I have good news father! Now is not a good time. Let’s talk in the evening! Father… I am being promoted! I wanted to tell you first! I’m a survey officer now. In Delhi I’ll be given a house, a car… They’re only giving everything! I have to leave next month! Go! All of you go away! Leave your responsibilities and go! But I thought you’d be happy hearing this! A house, a car, a job… Isn’t this what you wanted? I don’t want anything! If you leave it’s enough… Leave! Raghu was right! You’re never satisfied by anything! All your life, neither were you happy nor did you let us be happy! Henceforth at least it is better if we look after our own happiness! Children back answering their father!? What is this? Are we in the 21st century? On such a bad day, in such a bad moment, what else would have happened, tell me? A little this side… A little… A bit… Enough… Enough, enough! Madhusudhan’s heart finally gave way! Sudhi! So sad, how did it happen? So sad… It’s not Sudheendra’s fault. This was bound to happen someday… Aachar used to swallow a dozen tablets daily! Mother… The snack cupboard key… Give it! Give it! Be quiet! Give it to me… I’ll look after it! All of you must do well, study like your father and earn well. Don’t trouble your mother too much and don’t stain your clothes… Otherwise, you’ll have to wash them yourself! If that neighbor Girija’s clothes fall into the compound, don’t give them back. Even after repeated w arnings they don’t use clips! Fine… We’ll leave now. With Aachar gone, so was his job... Take care Thimma. With Aachar gone, so was his job... Take care Manja. And the car, the telephone, and the house help that came with it. They all went back. Gowri! Yes? Do we have to drop out of school and stay at home? Do we have to cook for ourselves? Do we have to clean the house too? Do we have to wash Jaggu’s underwear? And clean the bathrooms too? The housework will somehow get done… Who will get me married? Do we have to get you married too? I know that you’re sad… But you’ll have to fill father's shoes and take up the responsibilities of the house. Raghu… I wanted to tell you something… Tell me! I’ve been promoted. Congratulations! If father was here, he would’ve been so happy, isn’t it? Next week… I’m shifting to Delhi. Are you joking? I… I have to go Raghu. If you suddenly leave like this… How will I go? Go where? It’s… For the Basavanagudi house, I’ve already paid an advance! How can both of us leave? That’s what I’m saying brother… You stay here, I’ll go. No, you stay here! I’ll go! No brother, You stay here, I’ll go! Look Raghu, it was you who always told me that we should live the way we want in life. Yes… I spent all my life trying to be a good son to father. Henceforth at least… I’ll do what I want! I didn't mean that brother… Is it a matter of money? If you want money, I’ll send it! It’s not a matter of money! Is it space? Father is no more, I’m also leaving for Delhi… You shift to the bedroom. Brother… And it happened just like Sudheendra said! Raghu shifted into his father’s room and all of his father’s responsibilities fell on him! And along with it… No, no, don’t panic… These tablets are only for gastric! Because of the office work load you’re not eating on time… The house is filled with people… I can’t run the household if I don’t work hard! I understand, but if only you work this hard… Jaggu and Suma aren't young now, Just wait for a few more days. They’ll also take up responsibilities. Don’t worry about it, Rukmini… Uma, you cook… Leela, you wash the clothes. Vijaya, you wash the vessels. Gowri, you mop the house. Jaggu… You sweep the house. What will you do? I'll check! If you are doing it properly or not! I can also do that! Then do it as you sweep! Put the broom down! What are all of you doing? Suma… Jaggu… Both of you have to start looking for jobs. What!? How can I look for work? If a girl gets a job, who will marry her? Me… I was also thinking the same! Look… Arranging weddings right now is going to be difficult! Why? Do you know how expensive it is to arrange weddings? With the salary I get, it’s difficult to even run the house, weddings are just beyond us! And the rest of you! Don’t depend on anyone and learn to stand on your own feet! Focus on studies, focus on getting a good job. Not on finding a good husband! My dear, get the suitcase and come… Move! There is dust! Good morning, sir! Yes? Sir, Here… I had filed an application! For a job! Name? Mohammed Fayaz! Sorry… We have appointed someone else for the post. Sir? We have given the post to someone else. Sir, I asked outside. That post… They said the post is still vacant! Look… I can’t give you that job! Why sir? Did you not see my application? I went through it… I’ve also seen the religion column! So that’s the matter… Yes! Now please get out! If I don't go? Ramappa! Send him out! One minute! Whatever be the job, it should always be given to the most qualified, not to those who seek favors of fortune! In the name of caste and religion, you creeps have forgotten humanity! But remember this! Humanity is like a tree! Even if you chop it with the axe of religion and cut it into pieces… It will grow back! I’m also like that… I’ll prosper in front of you! Was it good dude? It was awesome! How was it? It was good! Rama… He acted superbly! It was superb! Thanks! It was very good dude! Jaggu! Jaggu! Jaggu! Wonderful man! Such an amazing performance dude! Thank you, sir! Incredible! Just incredible man! Sir! It’s all your… Jaggu… When I see you act… Yes sir? You just transcend with your performance! Be serious about it! Your looks are passable too… But sir at home, expenses are high! They’re torturing me to join a factory. Fine! Who says there’s no money in theatre? There is! We’ll get money if people come! Yes sir. But I don’t have that much time sir… Jaggu… Yes sir! For 6 months, you somehow manage… 6 months!? We’ll see later! Suma, I can understand your situation but you’ve only studied till… I’ve studied till 10th. Really? Here it says 9th… I’ve studied but haven’t passed, that’s all! Then how can it be possible? Without finishing high school how can you teach high school students? It’s fine, leave it! Silence! Be quiet! If you want, a nursery teacher spot is vacant. Is that so? Nursery teachers just don’t stay on, they give some excuse and quit! You won’t do that right? No ma'am. I can work for a year… After that? Next year, I’m getting married and going to London! Till then I can work! We need someone permanent… Really? It’s fine, leave it! Congratulations! For your engagement. Thank you! Silence! Suma, you were saying something about the job… Drink some water! Brother! Brother! What is it? It will fall! Have some sweets brother! Why? I’ve got a big job at the factory! Really? What’s the salary? 80 rupees… The pay might be less but the factory is huge! Jaggu… Leave this factory, come to my company. I’ll put in a word. That… How can that be correct!? Jobs should be given to the most qualified not to those who seek favours of fortune! Mother what is he talking about? He is clearly warped! Suma… You were saying something. Me? I wasn’t saying anything! You were talking about the job! That… There was a vacancy for a nursery teacher but it didn’t work out! Why? They wanted a permanent teacher! Anyway, next year I’m getting married and leaving! That’s why I… Suma! Is getting married a big achievement? Let’s say there's a proposal from somewhere tomorrow. From London. Delusion! Fine! From London then… Do you know that marriages give rise to bigger responsibilities? You shelved the responsibility of even a small job! I didn’t run away! Then go take up that job tomorrow. Do I really have to go back there? Mother! I believe my looks are passable, is it so? No, my dear. You are handsome! Eat. Good morning, madam! I’m from Vimalaya Drug Company… No! I won’t buy anything! No madam! I’m not selling anything. I just have to ask you a few questions. What? That’s your only job? That’s all madam! Please have it! Please have it! It’s fine madam. Should I bring another? It’s fine! Shall we start? How many members are there in your family? 10! Is this work very hard? Nothing like that. At your home… How did you get this job? Any Vimalaya products… And… What’s the salary you get, please tell me once! Madam, please answer my questions! Look! Other than sandal soap we don’t bring anything! Usually, which soap… Look! Soap, powder, paste, saffron, vermillion, I’ll tell you about everything later! First answer my questions. Holy mother! What do you want? I want this job. What? You’re living comfortably in such a big house Why do you want this job? Why? You're not married, is it? Or… Is your husband problematic? What’s the issue? Tell me! I’ll also listen! Look! Your questions about the soaps were better! Ask me those! But where to get this job… Tell me that also! What do you want? I have come from the Vimalaya Drug Company! Can I ask you a few questions? Get lost lady! For the frog born in a well… It’s the vast ocean! Till it leaps outside The world is ethereal! For the luminescent beetle at dusk It has the sun on its back!

They have built castles in the air with no stairways! - Why so late today? They have built castles in the air with no stairways! - Who are you? Go! Go! Go! Save me! Save me! As the dizzy illusions begin to sing, The tune is mellifluous… The whiff of reality blows on it and reveals the cacophony! Looking yonder with an effort makes the heavens seem closer! In the name of caste and religion, you have forgotten humanity! Shall this remain sir? Why are you walking around? With tied wings when flight is sought, This dialogue should not be said There lies the challenge! While walking around! There lies the challenge! Stand in one spot and say it! Okay sir. For the frog born in a well… It’s the vast ocean! Till it leaps outside The world is ethereal! Coming! I’m coming! I’m coming! It’s a good policy! Don’t overthink! Jaggu, take it! You also get one done! The two legs that trip adamantly walk on again! The goal should be unwavering to reach higher goals! - Jaggu! How was it? It was wonderful! This is Shashank. These are my friends! Keep them at bay… The disappointments! Greetings sir. Greetings. Noble intentions… Is what makes you victorious! Sir, can you buy me a drink? One that can’t be contained! That is only life! One that can’t be curtailed! Wait, I’ll help… No problem... This impish youth! Lower it! Fearlessly and with infectious zeal… Lower it! It will stand its ground! Look here Shrini! When new twists emerge, stunned, it will still face it! - Be quiet and lower it! When new twists emerge, stunned, it will still face it! - Why should I care! I’ll sit here only!

It’s been so many days since I saw you! Gowramma… For ten minutes, will you look after the child? What will you have Suma? Coffee? Juice? No, no. I just came to check in on you… I’ll leave now! Suma, sit for a minute! You just came and you’re leaving!? What is all this? This… I had gone shopping! I will leave! Suma, wait a minute! I heard about your father’s demise… How is everything at home? There are no problems… What happened to you? Didn’t you say you were going to Singapore? Singapore? Yes! You said you will settle down in Singapore once you’re married. That? Those days in mirth we spoke about London and Singapore! Are you still hung up about that? Suma… Don’t fantasize that you’ll be happy somewhere else… Find a nice man here and get married quickly. Age is not on your side… I’ll leave… Suma, wait! Suma! Vijaya, did you finish your homework? There is no ink brother. Some excuse or the other! I told you that I didn’t want to work! You scared me to death! What happened? Look how badly my face has tanned! Such a waste! We could have made a few fritters! What are both of you doing? Who asked you? Go! Look what has happened to my face! Who will marry me? That Jayashree is 2 years younger than me! She’s gotten married and also has a child! She’s really beautiful, you know… Where did you meet her? Why bother about that! I haven’t found a husband! Focus on that! I’m 27! Really? She doesn’t look like it, right? I’m not joking! Sorry, my dear. Due to the workload, it has slipped my mind! Do you even remember that I exist? Where will you let us forget that! What? Nothing! Henceforth I'm not going to work! What are you going to do at home? She’ll make fritters, chill brother… Be quiet! I'll be in your face, lest you forget! Fine… Done. Stop acting like a child! Suma… You know how stubborn Suma is... Suma! She could be there all day. You please go and come back soon. Make fritters! How are you... Savitramma? Come, please come... I will make lemonade. Lemons are quite expensive now 20 paise apiece, why bother? Please sit down! Where is Rukmini? She’s not to be seen? As she is in her 7th month, she’s gone to her mother’s place. Your husband is sure to be reborn as your grandchild, mark my words! Yes, yes. Suma, come here. We have brought mangoes. Please prepare some mango pickles for all of us. The taste of the one you gave last time still lingers. Here, take these 2 rupees. Why pay her? She’ll make it for free. Let her have it, for some sundry expenses... She can buy lemons. Let it be. You’ll have lesser worries once you find a good boy for Suma. There’s a good boy from my sister-in-law’s family! He owns an electric shop. Why? Couldn’t find someone who has a puncture shop? I’ll consult my son and tell you… Let me know as soon as you can... many people are vying for him. Fine, we’ll take leave... Bye… It is better to dive into the village well than listen to these people’s sly comments. What was so wrong in what they said? By the way, didn’t you mention that your sister-in-law’s brother is very aged? As if she’s very young! No matter what you apply to your face age starts showing! Say what you wish but this is what happens when girls go out and work. There are four more girls after her! Who knows what God has written in their fate! What did they teach you today? Today it was Maths, it was so good. - Did you understand what was taught in class today? Vijaya is so grown up now! Teach me too… Fine. Where were you girls? Tuition sister. If you trust Raghu and keep studying none of you will get married too! How are those two things related? You keep quite mother, you are naïve! Go inside and wash the clothes. Not to those who seek favors of fortune! Jobs should be given to the most qualified not to those who seek favors of fortune! Where is Raghu? What is it with you? Are you avoiding me? I was just changing my clothes. You said you’d bring photographs. Why are you badgering me? I will bring them… I’ll bring them tomorrow. See what’ll happen if you don’t bring it! Are you making Dosas? You shut up! In the mango grove, There are 1000 mangoes! You have to choose one of them! In the mango grove, There are 1000 mangoes! You have to choose one of them! If it is sour, then a pickle, If it is sweet, then for sure a fruit jam! When the roasted chillis’ sputter, Then it will be added as garnish! In the mango grove, There are 1000 mangoes! You have to choose one of them! In the same fruit, So many varieties Why did God have to stash? The parrot should fall in a daze Tasting the fruit it pecks. The pestle has to accompany The grinding stone! On just seeing the fruit The cheeks reddened in anticipation! The white jasmine became a red lotus! Look at his mustache! Poor child! Oh! No! I don’t want a guy who stays in a village! What a show off! How arrogant! Looks like he has a bad temper! Searching perennially for the ideal man… Finally, the young girl became An archaic white-haired granny! Lamenting eternally in search of a courageous man… In vain, the bride to be fainted on the auspicious day! Someone had a crooked face… The other was a dunce! Who is this? A man with tons of make-up!? Oh! No! A brute goon! Oh! No! A thug of the worst kind! Oh! No! Shall I call for the brave-hearted crown prince? The wedding season is coming to an end, When will you pick a groom? When will you blow the trumpet, Get all the relatives together And serve the wedding feast? Come what may, I will not agree To compromise on my dreams! Now and forever, I wish to be... The queen of my own story! In the mango grove… In the mango grove… There are 1000 mangoes! You have to choose one of them! In the mango grove, There are 1000 mangoes You have to choose one of them! In the same fruit, So many varieties Why did God have to stash? In the same fruit, So many varieties Why did God have to stash? Mother... There’s a boy. His photo? Whose photo shall I get? Haven’t you rejected every boy in town! The only ones left are either the elderly or animals! What can I do? You show me boys who deserve to be rejected! Mother, the boy is my boss’s brother’s son-in-law’s friend. He is the HoD at the University. He has done research on snails and has a doctorate in it. Mother, I have told them to come on Sunday. What? A PhD on Snails? She’s as lazy as a snail! You have found the right guy brother! Eat quietly. Whatever happens, once I marry, I don’t want to live in Bangalore! The boy’s from Mysore. Mysore, is it? I want a groom from overseas or London only. London is right in our backyard. You don’t act smart. Yes… All the boys overseas are fasting for a bride like you. Mother, I don’t like this! Who asked you? To send everyone here overseas is this a house or the US Embassy? Brother! Brother! What? What is ‘hennbasi’? How did you give birth to this specimen, mother? They send her to US but don’t send me anywhere! Please take it. Did you prepare it? Please have it. Which college did she study in? College? She’s only studied till the 10th. What? But Venkatappa said that your sister is a graduate and has a BSc in Home Science! That’s why we are here. Moreover, our son is a PhD. That’s Uma, another sister of mine, the girl to be married here is Suma. Be it Uma or Suma... In all, we need a well-educated girl! Suma keeps reading Kannada magazines like Sudha, Mayura, Karmaveera. Once they are done, she won’t even spare Chandamama and Balamitra! Isn’t it brother? He’s joking, she takes good care of the house. Look, our son is a PhD, and a college HoD. We’ve to find a girl who will match his standards! If she was a graduate, it would’ve been nice. Anyway, let it be… Mother, let’s go. Wait! Why don’t we see the other girl who has studied Home Science? Her? Go call her! Uma! Uma! My dear, have you finished your degree? No, I will finish it this year. Her second attempt. She’ll find a job as soon as she finishes, please don’t worry. No, no! Would any girl from a respectable family go and work outside? For us, it’s enough if she’s educated... What do you say! By the way, our son is a PhD. You have told us already! There’s nothing to worry about. He gets a handsome pay. What do you say, Savitramma? How can we get the younger sister married before the older one? There’s still time till her exams, find the elder one a groom by then and get her married. My dear, do you agree? Please eat the sweets. They are made with ghee. It’s fine. Sister… Sister, I didn’t know what to do. Enough! Anyway, he was not up to my standard! Leave that… Go wash all the vessels from your in-laws visit today! Mother!! Mother!! Jaggu! Every one come quickly! Mother, move! Brother, brother! What is this! You bought a new scooter?! Sister… Come here! Careful man! Give me some space, I will sit! Don’t spoil it on the first day itself! See here, see here! Don’t spoil it on the first day itself! How wonderful it is! See the color! Isn’t it so nice? You bought a new vehicle? The company gave me this mother, I have been promoted. Is that so? Bless me. I will go first! Brother, let’s go, come brother! Brother! That’s great. Brother, shall we take it for a spin? Yes, let us go. Come! Wait! We have to conduct a pooja first... Leela, Gowri… Run and get the veneration tray! Come! And another thing. I’m taking everyone to West End for dinner this evening. Let’s go! Let’s go! To such a fancy place? Please don’t… Just bring Rukmini home, I’ll make some sweets. What is this mother! You’re always like this all our lives! Always making the same insipid spread at home. Let’s go mother. Fine, let’s go. All of you be ready in the evening, I’ll tell Govindanna and call for two autos... Sure, sure! Sir… Ma’am… Sir, just let me know when you’re ready to place your order. Thank you. Look at this… Hope you are comfortable? Shall I order tomato soup? Okay. Is it Saaru? Soup, mother! Show it to me as well! What shall I order, tell me? Paneer L-a-b-a-d-o-r… Brother, isn’t Labrador a dog? Brother, Labrador is a dog! This is Lababdar! It's not like that dear. You order for me as well... Shall we ask for Matar masala? Mutton!? This English medium school has totally spoilt you! Do they cook meat as well? No mother! Leave it, I’ll see something myself... They do cook meat, but in a different vessel. What if they use the same ladle? It's in English... They use another ladle mother. As if you know how to read! Couldn’t you have told me all this earlier? Moussakka. Wasn’t it nice mother? Brother… The food was amazing! Brother, can we come here again? When I get the next promotion, we will surely come here. Next time, I will make it at home. One will get promoted, another will get married, sister-in-law will have a baby! What about me? Suma… Why all that now? Let it go… All the younger ones are getting married before me because I’ve been letting go. The wedding has only been confirmed for now another boy might show up. Those who come might choose Leela or Gowri, for all you know! Everybody is keeping me aside like the clove in a laddoo! It’s all because of you. You purposely bring such boys! They rejected you because you were not educated. How’s it my mistake? Neither did you study, nor do you go for work. I worked really hard. You did! You worked very hard to let it go! That’s all! Why that topic now? How is it related? What else? You want to be happy without working for it! You want to earn without working at all! And you want to get married despite rejecting all proposals. You’ve failed 10th, but want an educated groom, that too from London... What do you think of yourself? You rejected so many good boys, now that one has rejected you; you can’t handle it! Where are you going? This is not your house. Sit down. Sir, anything else? What happened? I shouldn’t have spoken like that... What you said was not wrong but the way you said it was. I’ll be back... Where? I… Just a minute… Suma? Su… Why are you sitting like this in the dark? I know you’re upset. I spoke to you like that so you understand the situation, that’s all. I had no intention of hurting you. Let’s do one thing. Let’s look for a groom for you before Uma is married. Not from Mysore or Mylapur but from Manhattan! What do you say? If you are always grumpy, which boy will agree to marry you? Oh! Rukmini is waiting outside. I’ll drop her and come, Mrs. Cosmopolitan! Cosmo? Brother, sorry... Nothing happened to you, right? Are you fine? Everyone’s so happy, Careful! There’s laughter once again in the household... - I’ll leave… Bye! It’s the sign of a happy ending. Still, how do I say this? That day Raghunath Achar’s lifeline had reached its end. So sad. What a tragedy! Raghu was such a nice boy. I pity Rukmini. Where is she? She is going to live with her parents. They have a lot to deal with now. She’s going to get Raghu’s LIC money, I believe! Thank God, he did that one good thing... Why are all the men in this family dying one after the other? Someone must have performed witchcraft or sorcery spells on them... Oh! God! You… Keep quiet, quiet! Even I have the same feeling... If it is not warded off, the next will be... Jaggu! We were just talking about you. Brother was very fond of Shyam Bhatru’s fried fritters and sweets. That’s why we’ve got it made for everyone. Please eat it before leaving. How can we eat now? No, no, we will take it in a box. We’ll leave now. Did you eat? If you behave like this, how will mother go on? I’m unable to accept all this, Jaggu… I kept fighting with him till the very end. I didn’t even try to understand him! What’s done is done, what’s the point of regretting it now? Everything will get better. And… I spoke to my factory owners, they have decided to increase my wages. Just wait… Jaggu… How can you act like this in two places? I know everything. I have left theatre... I have found a job. I swear on you. Did we have to go through all this to get a grip on the situation? Look... Henceforth all the responsibilities of the house are mine! Don’t worry. Not just yours alone. We all have to take it up. Let’s eat for mother’s sake. I will serve. Mother... Both of you have finished your degrees, why not take up a job? Fine sister. Take this.

Affectionately the banyan tree… Greetings! Affectionately the banyan tree… Have you brought the photo? It is... Has penned this under the shade on the ground… Without burning under the scorching sun The advent of rains is impossible! One will suffice. The advent of rains is impossible! - It's not like that, they're both different girls. Without traversing the darkest nights Yes, that is so! It won’t be dawn! Fine, I will inform you. Is that so. Please do so. Fine. Greetings. We will take leave. Greetings. Greetings. It doesn’t match. Come… Please see this. These do match! Give me! Give me! Tell me! No! I won’t tell! Please tell me... Am I not taking you? Please sit quiet for a minute. You’re acting too smart! Get down. How do you even know such wealthy people? Do you think they'll like our Gowri? Sister… We have not come here to see a groom! Greetings. We are so happy that you came. Yes, we are so happy. We hope this alliance comes through, that's all we ask for. Yes, that's all we want… All this wasn't necessary. This is nothing! All this is nothing at all. We have only one daughter... Let’s get her married with pomp and grandeur! Janaki… See... Jagadeesh is so handsome. Yes… He is very handsome. He's the perfect match for our Aarti. Yes… He is made for her. Aarti… Aarti, come. Come. Come, sit down. Maybe it’s because we prayed to the sacred fig tree or so, that our daughter has grown just as tall... Even though she's of a marriageable age we weren't able to find a suitable groom! It’s fine, I understand. Yes… She’s 29 herself. Look! So what if you are older, the older you are, the wiser you get. She wanted to study till she got married and got two PhDs too… Our daughter… Yes! She is a little extreme in everything, extremely educated, extremely tall… Extremely beautiful too. Yes, yes. Your children will grow to be tall too. We really like Aarti. Is that so?! Very happy… Very happy! Everyone liked Aarti. They got married the next month itself. Sir, come a little closer. A little more sir… More, more. Okay! Smile! What if the wife is taller, being closer is more important, right?! I said that because, All of you come, even though the entire family was invited, Sister, I will stand here. Uma had come alone. Me, me. Look here. There were a few who didn't come to the wedding Okay! But Jaggu was so impatient that he would've gotten married even without the priest! Jaggu’s wedding took place in December, don’t ask how cold that year was! But even though winter passed Uma... and Uma continued to stay on won’t the family be worried? What happened? Nothing sister. I was so happy to spend time with all of you again. Mad girl! Will anyone cry for such things, tell me? We are so happy that you came, too. You have to stay for a few days before you go. Fine, come in now. It's cold. First wear a sweater. Uma’s such an amazing cook! No wonder brother-in-law was adamantly asking for a girl qualified in Home Science only! Brother… Do you think that Home Science is only about cooking? Then? They teach you how to run a household, raise kids, etc. Why do you have to go to college for that? If you get married, it would suffice! Then how come you don’t know anything yet! Looks like sister-in-law is not stern enough! When you get married, you’ll know! On the pretext of arranging an alliance, you yourself got married! There's a boy ready for her, sister. Who Leela? No one. Just tell us Leela, Anyway, Uma has camped here. Let her finish your wedding also and then leave. Tell… Leela… Why do you taunt her? Please forgive me Doctor! Home Science is magic! Brother-in-law is a lucky man. What was the urgency to hang these clothes? I would've helped later. That’s because the sun's out, sister. Fine… Give it. I don’t know if you remember or not but when we were very young, father used to scream a lot at mother. Ten kids, hundreds of expenses... He was fed up of having kids! Mother got angry once and went to her parents’ house. All of us were worried that we'll have to study engineering now. And father didn’t know how to run the house, he didn’t even remember half our names! Then one day, he took a bus and left too. What if he has gone to his father’s place and we are orphans now, this scared us! And then? What else… That evening he brought mother home. That was it! However angry he was, he vented it on us but not once did he speak harshly to mother, you know? Like this, for things to work out, it will take time… But we should be willing to give it time. I understand what you are saying, sister. Look Uma, this is your house only, you can come anytime you wish but… It’s not right for you to stay here like this. Fine sister, I'll write him a letter. Let that be… The issue is not that! The real issue is that you don't know how to hang clothes! Is this how you do it?! Solving the issue pleased Suma the fact that she solved it made her happy too, But is it enough to scratch the surface Why did you send the whole jar? When the problem is much deeper? Why do you behave like that! She’s your sister! There’s lot more at home! Lime, mango, gooseberry, tender mango, everything is there… The rangoli! Is it Srinath? Why are you here? Is this the way to speak to someone at your doorstep? Call him in. Fine, make some coffee. Fine. You don’t make it! Ask Leela to make it! Come in son. Greetings mother… Are you fine? Greetings. Why did you leave the cycle on the road, someone will steal it. Keep it inside. Let it be, anyway, I'm leaving soon. Come, come... Mother… Did you talk to her? Just because I smiled a little the other day now I have to make coffee for him! My bad luck! Look how brave he is… He has come to the house directly! He’s the most decent one among all his friends. Yes… Very decent and very handsome. Isn’t it so, sister-in-law? Be quiet, don’t tease her, poor girl! Brother Jaggu too had come to your house like this for an alliance, right? Yes! Are all his friends like this? If there's someone for me, will you let me know? Smile a little and go... They're laughing, I think... The wedding must have been fixed. Rocket! Then it went with a swish through the window and burst with a bang and everyone started yelping! Even if you tell it a million times, I will laugh dude! Mother. Leela, first give it to Srinath! Thank you. Sit down. Where's your coffee? No, I’m fine. Please take from this… No, I don't want to drink right now. How can I have it if you don’t!? Please take it. Take it. Srinath… Please tell that story about your grandpa and his Lungi... That one? No way! Tell them, it will be entertaining… Tell! It will amuse everyone! Say it dude. Please be quiet! Aarti, do you remember? His grandpa went to his fields and then due to the winds… It flew away! It was hilarious! It was hilarious! Tell it man! Keep quiet! What’s the matter, Srinath? Mother, it’s… I… I… I’m with you! Be brave and state it! Mother, it’s… I… Can I marry your daughter? That is if you... If she also wants to marry me. Not you, her! She is a little shy… We have no objections, my son. But speak to Leela once. Me? It’s fine… Let her ponder on it and inform me. There's no hurry. I'll leave now. He walked away! You should have let him tell his grandpa’s story, at least! This is juice! Not Coffee!! Leela… What have you decided? Let's make okra chutney and some seasoned buttermilk and vegetable soup. It will be awesome! I asked about Srinath. He's only studied a Diploma course. So what? Even Jaggu has studied a Diploma course. Exactly! See... Srinath is a very nice boy, we all know him very well. May be… But he doesn't have a decent job and lives in some godforsaken Kammanahalli… Should I leave my job and go and live there?! Kammanahalli is not that far madam... In a few years it'll become a part of Bangalore. How much is it? 4 rupees. I am buying this too! Leela… Life doesn’t always sway to our tunes, at times we also have to go its way. Is that so!? Then how come Krishna did not compromise when it came to you? He wanted a better educated girl and married Uma! It’s okay if he does it but not me, right? Everyone can’t be judged by their qualifications. A very educated person might turn out rotten and an illiterate can be a gem of a person. Please think it over! Oh! God! What a change? The once obstinate Suma is now advising all. After she insisted so much Please come in. Leela could do nothing but agree to the wedding. Sister! How are you? Are you fine brother-in-law? Are you fine brother-in-law? Everything looks amazing. Congratulations. Would you like to drink something? No, thank you. Uma… Come sister. Please come… How are you? Please come, Come, come, take your seats. I'll… I'll go talk to my sister and come. At Jaggu’s wedding, they served orange juice, this time it’s lemon juice, next, they’ll give us only water! Wait and see! That poor girl is getting wedded at her own expense, I believe! Can’t believe how things have changed for the Aachars! Look at the younger one … How she is wearing a sleeveless blouse! Does she think she is a cinema heroine? Someone must have performed witchcraft or sorcery spells on them... Oh! God! Oh! God! Please bring it fast! Leela… It’s late! Open the door! Give me two minutes!!! What is it? The priest wants a lot of things, I am baffled! When did you ever understand anything? Go and ask Aarti, I will come. Uma, how are you? Everyone is calling you! Done, almost done!!! Sister… Leela! Uma! How are you? What is this? You are wearing a blouse like a conservative lady? Where is Leela? God only knows! Make it fast! What else… Is your husband here? Yes. Hope everything is all right? Yes, sister. Fine, I will go and sit with him. Uma! What is this??? This… I fell down from the stairs. What’s all this? Be honest! Nothing… Just like you said… Everything is getting better. Uma! How long should I wait! Should I sit there alone like an idiot?! One minute! What is this? How does it concern you?! Uma, what is all this, tell me! Suma… Uma is my wife… This is our personal affair! Uma is my sister! She is family! Leave it! This is a wedding hall! Everyone is watching! So what if they watch!? Will it spoil your reputation?! And what if they come to know that you’re beating her? Suma! Listen everyone! Mr. Krishna doesn’t like the attention you are giving him, please look away! Have you gone crazy? Uma, let’s talk about this at home! Come. She will not come anywhere with you! What is this nonsense! Talk softly… Nonsense? Hitting my sister makes sense to you? You all are here too? Please take center stage! You love gossiping about others, right… I myself will share a hot piece of gossip with you, please listen! This man here, he hits my sister! Unable to bear it she came home. Unable to speak about it, she bore it in silence. I sent her back to that hell. Uma, please forgive me. You don’t have to go anywhere. You stay with us. Who are you to say all this? You have an elder or younger brother, right? Call him! Doctor? Did you call me? Did you not hear what Suma said? Sister… What’s all this? Please compose yourself. Don’t cry sister. My dear friends! The show is over! If you are troubled by this, you are welcome to leave. The rest of you must attend the wedding and leave only after having lunch. Don’t cry. Don’t cry sister. Sister… There is an issue. If this is causing any trouble to your family. I’ll tell them right away. That’s not the matter. They are fine with it. I’ve told them that it’s tradition for you to enact a drama at the time of the wedding. They are quite happy about it. Then what is the issue? It is… Leela is missing! I don’t know where she is. Why are you looking for her? Don’t you know that you are not supposed to see her before the wedding? She was in her room just now. In the room? Where do we find her now sister? Jaggu, where's your scooter? Guru took it to the market. We have a bus. I'll borrow someone's cycle. Jaggu, manage everything here somehow until we are back. Come, come! Come fast! Did you find her? Sister, shall we go to the bus stand? Go straight, let’s see! Stop, stop, stop! Sister, sister, sister… Just a minute! It’s been a year since she went to the temple! How do you know? It’s because… Forget it! But I know a place she frequents every day… We’ll go there! Srinath… Did you lock the cycle? Oh, no! I forgot sister! It’s fine! Sir, sir, sir! Have you seen my sister Leela Aachar anywhere? Didn’t I tell you that she’ll be right here?! Leela! What are you doing here? Madam, please join the queue... Sir, one minute sir! I've been coming here for two days now, my work is not getting done! Leela! Leela! Please! Just a minute, we'll leave! Leela! You… Don’t tell me anything! I’m not interested in this wedding! Fine! If you don’t want to, that’s it! If you don’t want to get married… Don’t! Sister… I thought you were on my side! It’s the two of you who have to marry and live together! You guys decide whatever you want! I’m sorry. It’s fine, I understand. Can I at least ask what happened? I… I feel like I’m compromising a lot for this wedding! But I didn’t ask for anything… You won’t understand all this. I can understand only if you tell me, tell me calmly and I will listen. Look… I don’t want to leave this job! You are here even on your wedding day I can guess that much! Don’t leave the job! What! Will your family agree? My family is bragging to the entire village that you work at a bank! Village? Kammanahalli is very far! It will be too difficult to commute every day. It’s been six months since I moved to Banashankari. If you wish to, you can live with me. But… I am just a diploma holder. I doubt you're keen on marrying me. Can you judge everybody by their qualifications? Couldn’t you have discussed all this earlier? The auspicious time is closing! Hurry!!! Come… Oh! God! My cycle is missing! Why did this have to happen now! What is the time set for the wedding? It’s at 11:30! And the time now? Leela? What are you doing here? Sir! It’s like… Sir, my cycle is stolen. I was heading to your wedding only, come, let’s go in my car. Where are the bride and groom? Where are the bride and groom, my boy? They’ve gone to the temple to seek blessings. When I am here, why did they go there? Are you Suma? Yes, why? Your sister gave us the pickles you made, they were very tasty. I heard you make it for your neighbors. Just like that… Why don't you make it on a slightly bigger scale? You can get a loan for that at our bank. Please stop here. You also come... After all the ruckus, finally, the wedding took place! Even though it wasn't important to Leela anymore, Srinath took up engineering at an evening college. Gowri got married to Venkatesh in a wedding which was much less dramatic but still sweet and simple. Aarti fully supported Jaggu’s dream of being a successful actor! Vijaya too joined the bank like her sister. And... And you can guess what happened next. Uma sought divorce despite society’s opinion. Some relationships bring peace when they are around and some bring peace when eclipsed. After everyone settled down, Vijaya convinced Suma to think of marriage and even put an ad in the paper. No one has contacted yet but still Suma was no longer a square peg in a round hole. Suma and Uma started a pickle business together. The sisters’ self-employment scheme grew beyond the walls of their kitchen in a few days. It is said that if a woman learns, it is akin to opening a school. Suma who had learnt things the hard way in life started her own factory. It became a source of livelihood for many other women. The pickle that used to be sold door to door went to the market for the first time. Market forces involve marketing, so Suma came up with a brilliant plan for that. And the plan worked wonders! The pickle that was born in jars is now being transported in barrels! Recently Suma went to London and that too with her own money! Let’s wait and watch… Who will marry her now. If it is fixed, you will get to know from the BBC. Now it’s time to wind up… But don't forget to taste the pickle.
