Hi. John: Hey, how are you? Alexa: [Whispering] Good, how are you? Good. This is my wife, Alexa. Hi, it's so nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I was just telling John how great he's done for the company. And we appreciate it. A good calculator does help, but thank you. What do you do? Well, John and I have twins. My son is the star of the football team. [Crowd cheering] [Whistle blowing] [Crowd cheering] My daughter is valedictorian. [Audience gasping] That's correct! We have a winner! [Audience applauding] And John, well, clearly John is doing great. You're a stay-at-home mom. I always wanted to do that. Work just got in the way. I guess you can't do both. John: Let's eat, huh? You hungry? -Mm-hmm. -John: Good. -Ravyn: Beau! -Beau: Ravyn! Ravyn: Cut it out. Give it. [Ravyn laughing] John: Both teams struggle for the hat. Ravyn's got it. Beau's going for it but wait! Dad's in the middle for the sack. What's on your mind? Football! Same as yesterday. Dear lord, bless our day today. Be with Beau for his game. And be with ravyn for her ap Latin class. Most of all be sure you give my amazing wife some quality time today. -Amen. -Amen. See you at the game! -See you. -Thanks, dad. John: How are you this morning? What do you think? This pillow or this one? The green one. So, I've got something for you. [Alexa gasps] I saw you eye this at the store. -Thank you! -Can I put it on? Yes. [Inhales and exhales deeply] [Doorbell chimes] Hello, may I help you? Yes, can I exchange this, for this one? Perfect. [Crowd cheering] [Whistle blowing] Hi. Ravyn, honey, before I forget, this came for you today. -Hi, dad. -Hey. So glad you could make it. Mom said you weren't feeling well. I haven't missed a game yet. [Whistle blowing] Mom, I got early acceptance. I got early acceptance to mit. -Alexa: Good, good. -That's great, honey. Don't throw a party yet. You have to keep your grades up. I'm so proud of you. [Whistle blowing] [Grunting] [Crowd applauding] Oh, wow. You know, grandma's right. You worked so hard to get to this point, but now... Now the pressure is really on you. You have to maintain your gpa to stay valedictorian. Okay? [Whistle blowing] Alexa. Both your kids are about to go off to college. I still remember when you graduated. It seems like just yesterday. Pay attention. Or you're gonna miss it. I know. I know. Alexa, come here! Alexa: Jezi! How are you? Announcer: And that touchdown will make the score-- [whistles blowing] I mean, how amazing is Nathan and Beau, together out there? I know, I know. Our boys are gonna take US all the way to the championship. Mmm, it's about time this town had one. Okay, so did you see margo? No. Yeah, she gained like 10 pounds since Paul left her. -What? -Mm-hmm, it's horrible. Oh, my goodness, honey! -Your necklace is gorgeous. -Shh! -Hi, John. -Hey, baby. John: Hi, guys. Shh, don't tell John. I changed the one he gave me, for this one. Oh, good choice. It's stunning and it's our little secret. But to be honest, I don't like this vest. Really? I don't know what's going on. It looks like you borrowed it from your mother. -Really? -Just being honest. -But i- -i gotta go! Let's get coffee this week, honey! -Bye! -Okay, bye! Hey, coming to the party? I have to go home and finish my study cards. Come on, it'll be fun. You don't drink. That's why it's fun. [Laughs] Weirdo. -Have fun! -Thanks, see ya. Bye. Nice game, Beau. Beau: Thanks, thanks it was a long one. How about some ice cream, my treat. Grandma: I'm cold and you're not feeling real well. Let's go home. Grandpa: Maybe next time. John: I'm in, how about you guys? -Ravyn: Yeah. -John: Yeah? I'd love to, but I gotta join the team. What's up Taylors? John: Hey, Nathan. What's up guys? I'll see you guys at home, alright? John: Alright, be safe! Ravyn: Thank you. John: Alexa! You coming? Beau: You're positive that their parents are not gonna be here, right? I'm serious. -I'm nervous! -They are in Europe. They're not gonna be here. Alright, alright dude. He has the house to himself. I trust you, I trust you. They've got beer here, don't they? [Laughter] We wouldn't be here, guys, if there was no beer. Ladies and gentlemen! The party has arrived. [Crowd cheering] [Indistinct chatter] -Hey Beau! -Beau, you are awesome. You were amazing at the game. [Chatter] Here you go. Alexa: Thank you. [Phone ringing] John: Oh, sorry. [Phone ringing] Hi, mom. What? Oh, no. John: Honey, what's wrong? Ravyn, grab her bag. Got it. John: Alexa, what's going on, what's wrong? Alexa: Just go. I don't know where I'm going. Dad, he's at Saint Mary's. He had a heart attack. Call Beau. [Crowd chattering and laughing] Dude, I challenge you. Yeah, what do you challenge me to? I challenge you to an age-old contest. Dude, this guy is challenging me to a contest! Who does he think he is, huh? [Laughter] I can't get through. [Crowd chattering] Hey, are you coming? Yes, is Beau there? [Crowd cheering] He's kinda busy right now. Tell Beau we're coming. Okay, hun, we gotta get Beau. Then we'll go straight to your dad, okay? Alexa, honey? [Crowd chattering] Girl: Cops! [Police siren] [Crowd panicking] Officer: Sheriff's office, stop, stop! Over here. ID's gentlemen. Turn around. [Police sirens] [Phone ringing] Mom? Grandma: Not like that, ravyn. Cut it length-wise. Keep it trim and unison. Presentation is everything. It's not what's on the plate. It's how it looks on the plate. And you know, maybe you should have had your hair trimmed. You're beautiful, if you'd only try. Can I carry something into the dining room? Really wish your mother would have had you work more in the kitchen. Ravyn, will you help me? Don't take it personally. She's going through a rough time. It's always better to lift people up than cut them down. That's a nice photo. I really miss him. I know. I'm sorry. Alexa, what can I do for you? Nothing, I have it under control. Here, why don't you let me do this. No I got it. -I think-- -i got it! It's okay. No, it's not okay. It's all wrong. It should look different. [Sighs] It should be different. Jael: I know. Oh, no, no, no. Honey, no, excuse me. Your mascara's gonna run. Come here, let me look at you. Okay, you don't wanna be seen like this. What did you say to my friend? Don't hide your grief. You should if it makes your face fall off. It's my fault we didn't make it to the hospital in time. I should've got arrested too. Why didn't you? Well, they don't put their star player in jail. You're lucky. -Jael: Hi. -Hi, so sorry I'm late. No problem, how are you? I'm fine. Good, do you want some coffee? -Please. -Okay. [Indistinct voices] Hi. Jessica: How are you? Fine. I'm so sorry for your loss. Alexa: Thank you. Jael: There you go. -Alexa: Thank you. -Jael: Sure. I know we all loved, loved, loved our last study. And I am so excited to introduce our newest project. This time we get to be artists. [All sigh] I'm a terrible drawer. Me too, I haven't colored since the second grade, when my art teacher told me I stunk. -Aww. -Kelly: Yeah. [Laughter] Well, how many times in life do we question what god is doing? Exactly. There are many people in the Bible, like Elijah, who couldn't see what god was doing either. God's plans for US don't always look like we think they should. But the good news is, questioning doesn't mean that we failed as his followers. In your life, who would you say that you neglect the most? My husband. He works so hard and I'm not always understanding to him. Kelly: My son's goldfish. [Laughter] Jessica: That's funny. I would be willing to bet, it's probably you. That's why this is different. We're gonna get to learn about ourselves. And we're gonna see how god protects and provides for our emotional health. So, if you'll turn to page nine, our first activity is called who am I. The directions say, using colors, images, and words, express how you're feeling today. Okay? Alright. Have any of you ever felt cursed? The red in my drawing represents frustration and anger. I have struggled my entire life with not knowing who my real dad is. And sometimes, I wonder where god is. And my drawing has blocks on its feet. Because I feel stuck. My family is well-off, and I have everything I need and nothing I want. The problem is, I can't figure out what it is I want. Well, god sent Elijah on an adventure, that would eventually change him. And hopefully that's what this will do for US. Before next week, you'll want to read first kings, 17 through 19. Okay? -Thanks ladies. -Ladies: Thank you. Alexa: Was just looking at your drawing. That's beautiful. Alexa: Thank you. Jael: [Whispering] I'll call you this week. Okay? -Bye, Kelly. -Kelly: Thank you. Jael: Good to see you. [Bell ringing] Coach z: Oh, hello ravyn. I was just thinking about you and your family. How you doing? Fine, thanks. Actually I just wanna check my ranking. [Chuckles] Again? Ravyn, we just checked it two weeks ago. I thought you might wanna talk about-- can you just check it again, please? Okay, have a seat. How's your day so far? Ravyn: Okay. Alright, well as of today, you are number two. What? Coach z: Ravyn, salutatorian is a wonderful achievement. You're number two, out of 220 kids. Between me and you, Beau's also two. A hundred and two. But he's number one on your team. You okay? It's just this stupid class is bringing my gpa down. It's okay. It's not okay. I can help you study. It's not even like I'm ever gonna use Latin, in my life. B+ is not the end of the world. It would be for me. I have a b+. Teacher: Alright everybody, settle down. Exams are coming up. And next class you'll all get your study guides. This midterm exam will be comprehensive of everything this semester. It's worth 25 percent of your final grade. Nathan: I overheard coach talking on the phone yesterday. Oh, what about, cliff? Cliff is an idiot. All the running we do, you'd think he'd be able to outrun a cop. But he's off the team. What, did he quit? He didn't wanna sit on the bench, but he was a bench-warmer anyway, so I don't really get it. So what'd you hear coach talking about? Coach wants to get some college scouts out to one of our games. Really, when? Yeah, I don't know which one. Well, we gotta play good out there. Don't mess this up for me. [Laughs] [Bell ringing] Teacher: Ravyn, could you come here for a second? Would you make copies of the study guide for me? Beau: That's quite a load. Here, let me help you out. Beau, move that a little bit to the left. No, no, maybe a quarter of an inch to the right. Here, try this one. -Alexa: [Whispering] John? -John: Yeah? I can't take this. Okay, alright, alright. She is making me crazy. I know. It wasn't supposed to be like this. I'm supposed to move my kids out, before moving in my mother. She's taking over my house. I know, babe, I know. Look, this is how she's dealing with it. It's the only thing she can control. We've got to talk about Beau's drinking. Wait, what drinking? The other night when we picked him up, he'd been drinking. How do you know? Alexa, trust me, he smelled like it. He was drunk. What's there to talk about? Our responsibility as parents? Beau's responsibility? We all signed that athletic code. John, look around you. Look at this mess. I can't deal with anything else right now. I can't. Organizing those boxes, is not as important as your family. Look, I've been praying about this. [Doorbell ringing] Hi, honey. Hi! I made you a casserole. I just know how hard can be in times like these. So I made you my favorite, cheese and broccoli. [Commotion from inside] How's it going in there? Oh, I'm sure it's just a crazy time. It sounds like a lot of commotion. Are you reorganizing? [Laughing] Really, how are you? Hi, jezi! Come in and see our new arrangement. I'd love to. We're not done, so maybe later. Oh, I want her opinion. Thank you for the casserole, jezi. Nice chat! Oh, I'll come back later. No need. [Sighs] Grandma: Well, I think this household could use some organizing. If you wanna leave, and take your statues with you, I'm okay with that. Excuse me. Who wants to say grace? [Ravyn laughs] You okay? Fine. Jael: So if you had a chance to read first kings this week, then you know that god protected Elijah from a lot of people. [Chuckles] In your workbooks, you'll see that you have three concentric circles. The center circle is for your closest and safest relationships. The second is for people who know you, but not your most intimate details. And then the third is for acquaintances. The first time I did this exercise, I had a tenancy to try to lump everyone into the center. I wasn't recognizing that there were a lot of people in my life that weren't treating me well. And it had been that way for so long, I wasn't really noticing. So this is a really good way for US to recognize who and when to let someone close to our hearts. Is anyone in the wrong place? If so, use an arrow and move that person closer to or further away from your heart. Is anyone missing? I think i'm valuing my friend's opinions more than my family. I have a few friends who don't like my husband and they keep reinforcing negatives about him. I moved them out of the inner circle, to the second ring. I so get you. The light just went on. I'm realizing that I value what other moms think of me, more than what my family thinks. Same here. Jael: Oh, I almost forgot. This is a game that goes along with our study. It's wonderful. It's really helped my family to open up and share. I'd love for you to all try it out. Alexa would you like to take it home first? Oh, well... My family doesn't really have a problem communicating. -Jessica: Take it! -It'll be fun. Jessica: Yeah, it's a game. It's really something for everyone. [Laughing] Beau: Yeah, come on in. Alexa: Hi. Hey mom, what's up? What are you doing? Oh, I'm just watching the predators. [Sighs] Gotta figure out a way to beat them. Impressive. I didn't know how much preparation went into your game. Can you pause that? Yeah, what's up? Well, they were going in for the kick, but they made a touchdown. Oh, yeah, I know. Okay, so this is called a two point conversion. Instead of lining up for the kicker, you've got the center and the quarterback. He gets the snap, runs back to the back field, cuts off to the right field, throws the football, is waiting for the receiver in the end zone. Boom, two points instead of one. It's genius. [Laughs] You are so smart. Grandpa gave you this. Yeah, he did. Everything I know, I learned from that guy. -Alrighty... -Okay. I'll see you at dinner. -[Game on the computer] -Okay, see ya. Now is not really a good time. It's never gonna be a good time. I can't believe we have paper napkins. What happened to the cloth ones I gave you for Christmas? I have a sharing game. Would anyone like to play? That's a good idea. I think I'm a little old to play games. I love puzzle games. That's because you are a smart, studious kid. Yeah, she does have all the answers. Grandma: I love games. Alexa, do you remember when we played games, when you were younger and I always won? Well, I'm going to win today. I don't think anybody wins. I'll start. What is the hardest thing that has happened in your life? We have to answer the card we were dealt. I don't like the question. You know I don't think I need a card, to tell me that I'm feeling anxious about winning the championship. Nonsense, Beau. You're a winner, you're a winner just like me. Beau, about the game. Whoever has the card, has the floor. Okay. -[Doorbell ringing] -Like I was saying... -One second. -Beau, wait. -Nate's here, I gotta go. -Beau! We're not done talking... [Distant laughter] We've gotta deal with this. Remember when our biggest parenting dilemma was how much Saturday morning cartoons he could watch? [Distant laughter] John, he's a good kid. I can't turn him in. There are other football players at the party. We have to teach him to do the right things, now. I think he dodged a bullet when he didn't get caught. Really? Can't we just leave it alone? Can we pray about this? [Boisterous laughter] -[Thudding] -[Boisterous laughter] [Boisterous laughter] [Chattering] -Grandma: Give it to me! -[Chattering] [Chattering] Guys, give it to me, give it to me! Beau, do something. Oh, come on, grandma. We're football players, we gotta practice sometime. Boys: Whoa! Uh-oh. [Knocking at door] What? Can I come in? Mom, I'm busy studying. What do you need? I just wanted to say hi. Why? Can't a mom say hi to her daughter? That would be a first. Did you know that your name means dark-haired wise one? I hope that's on the test. What are you studying? Ap Latin, it's impossible. Really, even for you? You're very intelligent, you're valedictorian. Mom. Can you please just let me study? Ravyn... What's going on? I'm just really stressed out. What's the sudden interest in my life? I am interested. Really, because you didn't even seem to notice me at grandpa's funeral. Jael cared more about me than you did, and I don't even know her. Do you want to talk about it now? I just don't have time for anything. Jessica: I never thought of god as the refresher. That's what I mean. The refresher, I really like that. Jessica: That's what I need. My in-laws have been in my house for a week. I'm exhausted. I can't handle my in-laws at sunday dinner, let alone a week. Yesterday, I yelled at my husband, for leaving his dishes in the sink. That's nothing, my husband leaves his socks everywhere. Under seat cushions. Why would he leave his socks under a cushion? So that you can clean it up. Jessica: Well, he had just finished a 24 hour shift at the hospital. The point is, I need to pray for Patience. Be careful, when you pray for Patience, god gives you more opportunity to practice. That means more dishes. And socks. Peace, I meant peace. [Laughing] So god can refresh me. Well, then we will pray for peace for you. Jessica: What did you write? I highlighted almighty, majesty, and father. That's a very eloquent way to describe god. Anything else? I don't know what that would be. Oh, Alexa, I just feel like you have god in such a small box. You're making me feel like I'm not good enough. Like my answers aren't good enough. Sorry, I'm not as perfect as you. Not everybody has all the answers all the time. There is no right answer, it's a personal thing. Exactly. Everything's fine, it's fine. We caught Beau drinking at a party. He wasn't arrested but now my husband doesn't think he should get away with it. What are people gonna think? I don't want to ruin my reputation. Alexa, how does Beau feel about this? He doesn't even know we're talking about it. [Loudspeaker announcing] [Players grunting] [Crowd clapping] Hey, you okay? We have to do the right thing about Beau. Like right now? Not right now, now but... I've been thinking. I agree with you. [Loudspeaker announcing] [Whistle blowing] John: The student must refrain from socially unacceptable behavior, that is discrediting in nature to the ideals, principles, and standards of the community and school. Such activities would include, but are not limited to theft, burglary, assault, battery, vandalism, possession or use of a weapon, or being under the influence of, and or possession of alcohol. I was really hoping that wasn't in there. Consequences for violating the code of conduct shall result in immediate suspension from competitive activities for the next 25 percent of the total number of competitions scheduled. [Whispering] John, that's the rest of the season. Beau: What's the rest of the season? Nothing, Beau, don't ruin your appetite. Beau: I'm a football player. That's pretty much impossible. Yeah, about that. Do you remember when we picked you up at the party? What, the night grandpa died? The night we caught you drinking. Yeah, it was a party, what's the big deal? It was going against the code of conduct. I think it's a really big deal. What's a big deal? Nothing, ravyn, don't ruin your appetite. What's the big deal? -There isn't one. -Yes there is. Did someone do something wrong? -Beau: No. -Alexa: Yes. Yes. I haven't even opened it. Opened what? This. Good, I'm hungry. Why am I even cooking? Well, I'm glad this is over. Hey, no, we're not finished. Your mom and I believe you have to honor that code of conduct. We all signed it. You have to turn yourself in. Well, why? I mean, everybody drinks all the time. I know, that's why we've been struggling with this. Look, if you believe in god, then you have to tell the truth. Well, we've never done that before. We do now. This is stupid. What? Do you know what integrity is? Yes, it's doing the right thing. It's not just that. It's doing the right thing when nobody's watching you. God is always watching. I want our family to have integrity, where our words and our actions match up. You serious? This is so embarrassing. Being chauffeured around by my mom. I can't believe that you took my car away. You know, they can't win without me. Everyone will hate me. They'll know it was you, who made me tell them. [Snorts] You know what, you can't make me tell them. You're absolutely right, I can't. I know. But I can go in there and tell them. It's your choice. Coach z: Hey, Beau. Cover my roots, my gray is showing more and more. We just colored it. It's dry and brittle and i'm afraid it's gonna fall out. My son just called me. Beau Taylor turned himself in for drinking at a party. Alexa is getting so self-righteous. I mean, everybody knows that teenagers drink. Do you wanna know what I think? I think she made him do it. I would never do that to my son. I'm sure he drinks, you know. But as long as he's safe, and doesn't get caught by the police, I'm fine with it. I'm sorry, I just can't color your hair, it's so dry. Just do it! Who does she think she is? Without Beau, we can't win the championship this year. How could she do this to me? I thought that she was my friend. Obviously, she is not. [Whistle blowing] Aren't you gonna change? I don't even get to practice. Alexa: Beau, Beau? Beau! Beau, get back in the car! Leave me alone. What are you doing? I'm driving you home. You're just embarrassing yourself. [Horn honking] I don't care. [Horn honking] It's okay to be angry. We can even be angry at god. Good, because I am. Oh, honey, this must be so hard for you. It is. You're right. Alexa, if you would have parented them, like I told you when they were three years old, you wouldn't be experiencing these behavioral problems at 17. What are you doing to my kitchen? I'm organizing. Nothing's in the right place and it's a mess. Beau's angry. But it's okay. I don't blame him. But it's not an excuse to treat you poorly. But you did just ruin his sports career. [Bells ringing] [Indistinct voices] John: Honey? Come back to bed. I feel like we made a horrible mistake. Well, we didn't. We did the right thing. I'm glad my father's not here to see this. It would have broken his heart. Your father would have been proud. He was the kind of parent that I wanted to be. I feel like my heart is gonna break. Let it break. [Thunder rumbling] Hey, how you doing? Well, mom and dad are mad at me. The team hates me. I can't play football my senior year. Things are awesome. Sorry, Beau. I'm gonna go home and study. I'm gonna go home too. What about practice? I'm sure the bench won't miss me. So you wanna walk with me? Yeah, you're my only friend now. Plus, I think we should talk about you. I should've known. Beau: What are you doing cheating, ravyn? I haven't read it. Then why do you still have it? You don't understand the pressure I'm under. But it's good to be under pressure. It means you're still in the game. I haven't done anything wrong. You should keep it that way. I don't know how I'm gonna sit on the bench, for the rest of the season. You know what? You wanna go play some catch or what, huh? Let's do it. I see some green. ♪ [Guitarist sings folk tune] -Jael: Hi. -Hi. Sorry I'm late. It's okay. I'm sorry I snapped at you the other day. I'm just going through a lot right now. And I know that's not an excuse. But I am really sorry, jael. I'm not perfect, Alexa. I am far from perfect. I just wanted to create a safe space for women to share. I know and I love our group. It's just my life is falling apart. And... I took it out on you, I'm sorry. I know. I really admired what you did with Beau. That was a very brave thing to do. You must be very proud of your son. I am. Thank you. Are we okay? Yes, of course. [Laughing] [Whistle blowing] [Loudspeaker announcing] [Whistle blowing] Set, hut! [Players grunting] He's open, he's open, he's open! Hit him, hit him, throw it! Nathan... The guy in the same color Jersey... [Loudspeaker announcing] Why'd you miss practice yesterday? You sick? Nope. If it happens again, you're off the team. It's not my call. Feel like i'm already off, coach. No, no you are still a part of this team. All the guys on the team hate me, for something that they're all guilty of. You still have to take responsibility for yourself, son. 2 Samuel 12:7 says "you're the man". That's what Nathan the prophet said to David. David made a lot of bad choices. And when he got caught, he was accused of being the man. You got caught, Beau. And there are consequences. Now you can either let those consequences define you, or you can let god define you. I don't know how to do that, coach. Yeah, you do. Just trust that he'll work it all out for your good. Alright, let me ask you this. When the football's snapped, what's your job? Make that catch and score. There you go. But, now you don't always know you're gonna get a pass. Right, I guess the football's either there or it isn't. But if you'd watch the quarterback, you'd know. Yeah but, if I'm watching him, I can't find my Mark. Son, the quarterback sees the whole field. He knows where the defense will intercept it. Or he knows where the pass will be complete. That's his job. Your job's just to run the play. You understand what I'm trying to tell you? I'm talking about god, son. Have a little faith in him. He's been doing this a long time. Have a little faith in him. Jimmy, Jimmy, the game's on the field not in the stands! Let's go, get it together! [Indistinct voices] [Whistle blowing] Alright. Nice job, Alexa, way to break up the dream team. Alexa: It's okay, Nathan! You're doing great, just settle down! Oh, you're just so much better than the rest of US aren't you? [Crowd cheering] Come on, boys, we got this. Come on, Nate, you got this. Come on, buddy. You've got this! [Whistle blowing] Coach z: Well, that's it, get them together. [Announcement over the loudspeaker] Hey, babe. Sorry I missed dinner. It's okay. Work's been crazy with that merger coming up. I just hate missing the games. Mmm. John? Yeah? Never mind. [Laughing] Right? [Cheering] [Crowd cheering] Good play, bud! Jezi: We already have a coach! Beau should be out there playing. Honey, you gotta stop, these are our friends. Come on 20. Trust me on this, it works every time, every time! Let's go boys! Alright, let's go, pick it up! [Tires squealing] [Shouts] If you have something to say, you can say it to my face! Teacher: Students, as I previously explained, this exam will be weighted as 25 percent of your final term grade. So read the questions thoroughly, take your time. Okay, everyone grab your pencils and begin. Mom? Walt would want me to go. Coach z: Last night I wrote out this big speech, about what I was gonna say to you boys. Then I thought, you know what? They understand football, you understand the x's and o's. What I wanna talk to you about today is that I'm proud of each and every one of you. Not for what you've achieved on the field, but what you have achieved off the field. You've become a family, become a team. When we first started this, we were just individuals. We've learned to work with each other. When your brother gets down, you picked him up. And I'm really proud of that. Now this is a big day for US. A big day for this town. We haven't had a championship here in well over six years. I'd like to win that thing. But if we don't, I want you to know that I'll be just as proud of you, as if you hadn't. So before you go out on that field, I don't want you to pray for a win. I want you to pray that your friends stay safe, that the other team stays safe. And if you play like a family, like the team you've become, nobody's gonna stop you. Are you with me? [Clapping] Everybody go get dressed out. See Donnie for your game jerseys, and I'll see you out on the field. [Clapping] -[Distant cheering] -[Distant marching drums] There's something I gotta tell you, son. Turns out that the district doesn't consider a championship game part of the regular season. And since you fulfilled your obligation, I guess you're gonna need that. What's this? It's our new team jerseys. You're playing tonight, son. No way. Oh, alright, alright, now go get dressed, cause you'll look silly playing in your underwear. -[Distant cheering] -[Distant marching drums] Announcer: Welcome to Carson park. For the championship game between the crush and the predators. [Crowd murmuring] It's going to be an exciting game. [Crowd cheering] Mom, mom, it's Beau! Beau's on the field! [Crowd cheering] Don't mess this up for me, man. -[Crowd cheering] -[Crowd whistling] [Grunting] [Crowd cheering] Alright, let's go, everybody hustle up, let's go! Didn't need Beau to get here. We certainly don't need him now. Girl: Coach, get him out of there! Yeah, he's ruining it! Ladies, settle down with that. Peter, they're right. He is ruining it. Dude, you were more helpful on the bench. [Loudspeaker announcing] [Grunting] [Whistle blowing] [Crowd cheering] [Loudspeaker announcing] [Whistle blowing] Announcer: And the extra point is good, making it 7-0, predators. Alright men, let's go! Wake up out there now! Use your head, think. Huddle, huddle, huddle! Alright guys, Texas stack, 85-58. I'll be watching for you deep, okay? Ready, break! Let's go guys! [Whistle blowing] Announcer: That's second down for the crush. And the predators team in good form. [Whistle blowing] Announcer: Third down. The crush has a chance to get that third down, they desperately need. They're not passing the ball. They will. They will. Announcer: So far today, it's just not crush's ball. [Yelling] Set, hut! -[Loudspeaker announcing] -[Crowd gasping] Girls: Come on! He can get open but he can't catch. I know, this is so unfair. He really shouldn't even be playing. I mean, my son got US here and he shouldn't have to share the field with Beau. Jezi... You're right. You're so right, he did get US here. You think that you are so high and mighty, don't you Alexa? Well, you know what? I can tell the truth too. Honestly, I thought it was horrible, the day that you told me that you returned John's necklace for something better. What about the necklace? Jezi: Oh, wait, you didn't tell him? You know what that makes you? It makes you a hypocrite. What's she talking about? She exchanged your necklace for something better. Jezi, no she didn't, okay? It's right here. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you, I was embarrassed. You've been hiding this the whole time? See, she's a hypocrite. Jezi, hush up. Everyone can see your roots. They're brittle and frosty and falling out. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. There was just never the right time. Nothing's good enough for you. I don't wanna be that way anymore. I don't. I'm sorry. I know. [Crowd cheering] [Crowd cheering] [Clapping] Beau, Beau! I know I gotta settle down out there. Listen, I know it wasn't your choice to turn yourself in. But I'm glad it happened. I didn't cheat because of your example. You're back in the game. Use the pressure to win. Alright. [Crowd cheering] Way to go, that's it! [Crowd cheering] [Loudspeaker announcement] Come on, defense! Here we go, here we go. Alright, alright, here we go. Yes, alright, nice play, nice play! Announcer: 14-7 predators. It's a deep hail Mary pass. And it's complete! 45 yard completion. It's up, he's in the air and it's good! Oh, my goodness, it's good! That's touchdown crush! That's it, that's how it's done. Alright, Nathan, one! Let's go! Go on in after him. Let's go. Announcer: 14-13 predators. If the crush can make this extra point, it's a tie game and we're going into overtime. Hey, hey. -Come here man. -What's up? Beau: You gotta call a timeout. I've got a play that's gonna help US win this game. You gotta have faith in me, bro. Alright, alright. Timeout! What are they doing? What are they doing? Timeout, timeout! What is going on out there? I've got an idea. A play that we can win with. We're gonna fake the extra point, and we're gonna go in for the two point conversion. No, no, we're gonna kick the extra point, tie it up, and win it in overtime. Nathan: No, coach. Beau's right on this one. We can do this,. This is our time. What do you say? Your call. Alright then. Bring me a championship. [Players cheering] That's a two point conversion. What? Beau. Look, he's out there. He's a lineman. They're going for a two point conversion. Here we go. Hut! [Crowd cheering] [Chattering] -You heard it? -Of course. Teacher: John, Alexa! Alexa: Hi. You guys should be so proud. We are, Beau did awesome, didn't he? I meant ravyn. There was a lot to know on that final. You earned the highest grade in the class. [Laughs] Sweetie! Isn't my ravyn brilliant? Thanks, have a great night. Hey, Beau. Coach is buying pizza. You coming? Yeah, let's go, I'm starving! Nah, maybe next time, guys. Boy: All right. That's cool. Hi, good morning. How are you? Good, how may I help you? Good. I was wondering if I could return this. Is that okay? I think I can help you with that. Thank you. You're welcome. [Laughter] Grandma: Thank you. Jael: You're welcome. This has been an incredible study. The Elijah project was really hard for me, but incredibly rewarding. Do any of you have a highlight from your journey that you'd like to share? I would. Jael: Yes, please. I used to love to control the world around me, and the people in it. [Laughter] But I never enjoyed anything, because there was always something else that needed to be improved. There was always something else to perfect. Then I discovered the need for god, truth teacher. And I realized... ...that life is messy. And I don't have to keep everything so tidy. The crazy thing is, the thing that I was the most afraid of, ended up making me feel free. I'm just trusting in god. And just breathing. I can see the change. I wanna share something with you. You know, in life you can have all the answers, and not really know the problem. I thought each milestone, accomplishment, like getting married, having you, would fill me up. I'm learning that god created me just to be his child. And that is enough. I wish-- I wish someone would have shared that with me, when I was your age. Dear god, this has been a tough year on US. Thank you for working all things together for our good. And we continue to trust in you. In Jesus' name, amen. All: Amen. Let's eat!
