[mysterious music] Long has there been peace in the kingdom of Olaran, but in the Borderlands, there is a shadow imposing. The shadow prince, Korlan, searches for an ancient blade. He hunts breeds, descendants of shadow elves and humans. The Rangers, the king's vanguard, stand between the shadow prince and his destiny. This is their tale. [serene music] [suspenseful music] Get back here, girl! Hurry up, boys. We're losing her! [patrons laughing and chattering] [panting] Please, sir. Please, sir. Get you out, no beggars! No. [suspenseful music] Get along now, lassie. Time to be getting home. No please, just leave me alone! No! Please. Always running away. You've still got a few years to work off. Someone please! Someone please help me! The girl seems set on staying a while. Keep your own counsel. You're coming with us, sweetheart. Like I said. The girl seems set on staying. Get these boys an ale, Alvar. They'll be leaving after they drink up. And they'll be drinking fast. She ain't a girl. She's a breed. Breed or not, she has her rights. You boys have papers? I've had enough of your tongue, wood rat. You ain't the law. [adventurous music] He's a ranger, Jim. This ain't good. He's just one man. Take the ale. Don't do it, Jim! [patrons shout] [adventurous music] You're safe now, girl. Girl. My name is Sabine. Safe? You can't save me. [somber music] [suspenseful music] [weapon squelches] [man shouts] [indistinct whispering] [somber music] [eerie whispering] [eerie music] [eerie whispering] [speaking foreign language] [somber music] [eerie modulating] [eerie whispering] [bells tinkling] [whooshes] Kiera? You can't save me, Brander. [somber music] Kiera! [eerie whispering] You can't save me. [screams] [somber music] [suspenseful music] [grunting] Brothers. Long have our people been kept in the shadows. Behold, the sword of my father, our creator, our king. We were the firstborn of Adracil. We are the creators. It is our right, our place to rule. [orcs roaring] we must set balance and right what has been wronged us, our destiny lies ahead! [growling] These abominations say that we are the evildoers? What of they! [roaring] They who could not accept their rulers set above them. They think that a god created. We are their god! [roaring] Was it not King Dagron who created the orckind that now serve us? [roaring] There's a new age, my brothers. For 2000 years the remnant of my father's spirit has slept within his blade by soulprint. With the awakening of these blood runes, we shall unleash truth! So join me, my kin, as we call our brothers from all who over Adracil. The Razor clan in the South, [roaring] the Menarians in the West, [roaring] the Dranaissans in the East. [roaring] We live in a violent time, then violent rulers must take hold of it! [roaring] [somber music] [suspenseful music] Oh, right. [laughing] Ah, Lieutenant, back from recruitment, eh? Find any fresh meat for Janclow's crew? Just a bunch of whimpering pups from Olaran. I swear that place gets worse every year. No, just us grizzled vets, I supposed. Do we have our new orders, Lieutenant? Count Thrace says we're to draw a hard line at the Coldfill River. The orcs stay on their side, that's fine enough. But if they set foot on the western bank, that's another story. If they sent 16 of the war's rangers, eh? And just how many? An easy summer, then. All those soft city ladies can sleep like babes in their beds. And the bloody king and our noble lord commander, Count Thrace, get all their pretty noble flesh while ours is carved like pigs for the ungrateful porkers. Hmm. I know you're set on giving Mary that farm. Are you sure I can't talk you into staying on a while? Only one thing men like us are good for. No, Lieutenant. I extended the last six months when you asked. But I'm gone after this, sir. It's time to give Mary what she deserves. Rangers will always have me sword. But Mary, she has me heart. And that too can cut like steel. I understand. You have my blessing. Thank you, sir. [scraping] Went and visited Kiera's grave. [suspenseful music] [eerie music] [heavy panting] [suspenseful music] Orcs. Orcs! Orc raid! Form a line! Form a line! Keep it tight! Keep it tight! Form a line! [people screaming] Hold! Hold! [orcs growling and roaring] [adventurous music] [somber music] Clear! Corser, let's move out. Corser. Corser. Corser. [panting] You have your blade, Ranger. You have your blade. I'm sorry, friend. Your brothers are with you. Hang your sword in the great hall. We will meet you there. [thumps] We will meet you there. I served with him since basic. No doubt he'll be hard to replace. He was a good man. A caring man. Aye. He always laughed at all me jokes. Who's gonna tell Mary? She'll take it hard. They always do. So much for keeping the bastards on the other side of the river. They shouldn't be on this side of the river. Bloody hell, he was a good man. You a guard? It's a sore job, I expect. Yes sir. He was a good man. He's from Ravenfall. We'll have to pack his goods in, and tell his widow. This is a bad day. What's your name, boy? Soren. Soren Fell. You'll come with us to Ravenfall. You can make your own way from there. And what of the others? There's no time for that, Drustan. We will honor our brother and move out. [somber music] [fire crackling] I did as you bid, Count Thrace. I spoke with no one and came with haste. Would not my own chambers be more appropriate? The walls have ears that not even a wizard of your power can render deaf. We're secure here for now. My guards are watching the gates. We Rangers serve only the crown, and discretion has always been our ally. Have you brought what is needed? Aye, my lord. But I require no further readings, I know what it says. I've read it many times. Tell me, what did you see? [mysterious music] [stones rattling] [speaking foreign language] [stones rattle] Well? It is as before, my lord. Something has awoken in the darkness. The past few nights it has been stirring in my dreams. There are words whispering in the wind. Words like dead leaves blowing from the Borderlands. What words? What are you talking about? Shadows bound of shadows born. Darkness wakes, the darkness drawn. Shadows form and shadows gone. The blade is etched, the blade is born. And once again, the darkness come. [gasping] The edge of souls is what it means. That is what the wind is whispering. Dear god. Are you sure? Not as sure as the crows flying at dusk last night against the moon. What do you think it all means? [sighs] To a shadow elf, the spawn was the offspring of an elf and a human. A half-breed, breeds are children born of violence. Children of the damned. They cannot be so easily found. They look no different than you or I. Huh. If this is true, it'll be some hard legwork. The Rangers are up to the job. What will you do with the breeds? We could bleed them ourselves for the good of the kingdom, of course. I'm a warrior, but I don't believe in slaughtering innocents, breeds or not. Maybe they are the children of the shadow, but I won't kill them for the sins of their fathers. No, we'll find them and protect them here, and the shadow elves can be damned. But I don't want this getting out, do you hear me? No need for people getting alarmed. I won't bother the king with it until we know more. For now, we keep it to ourselves. You haven't told anyone about this yet, have you? No, no my lord, only you. Good. See that you keep it that way. [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] Lieutenant. Something ain't right. No. No it's not. Boy's good with a blade. Whiplash quick. I was never that quick when I was his age, and I reckon you weren't neither. That he is. But that's not what's bothering me. It's the orcs when he came upon them. Been worrying my mind all day and I finally figured it through. They pulling their strikes. And when was the last time you heard of an orc doing that? They like their meet bloody and dead. It's a long march back to the Grimmock Mountains. An orc war band wouldn't bother taking prisoners. Keep an eye on him. We'll make Ravenfall tomorrow. And then? We'll see. [knocking] [somber music] I'm sorry, Mistress. [crying] He was a good man. Magistrate had these, flew in. Lieutenant, that's Lacker Pyne and his crew. Bounty hunters, from out West, near Melatin. When they're around, bad things happen. I've heard of them. But we've already lost a day. All right, good luck. Let's move out. Take me with you! No. Please No! You're a man down. Everyone knows, Rangers work in fours. I know how to fight. You're good with a sword, kid, I'll grant you that. But rangering is more than just killing orcs. It's hunting and tracking, and setting bones and broken skulls. More importantly, we're judge, jury, and executioner. Out here in the Borderlands, we're the blade of the king, he speaks, we act. You've got some growing up to do before you think of rangering. Besides, it takes a year in the king's active service. I can track. I've been hunting in the wild all my life. Ever since I was-- We are a man short, Lieutenant. And after all, we can waive previous service. A man short, Flint, not a boy. I can learn, sir. Whatever the king wants. Whatever the king wants? [thumps] Yes sir. You don't know what you're saying. You have no bloody idea, kid. [thunder rumbling] [suspenseful music] [growls] [growling] How bad is it? Orders are orders. The king has his reasons, and he has no obligation to explain himself to us. That bad, eh? We're to meet Garrin's crew at Blackwell Crossing, and be waiting for the new orders from the lord commander. And those are? I'm still thinking on them. Don't think on 'em too long, Lieutenant. We ain't getting any younger. The way is clear, Lieutenant. Let's head out. [adventurous music] We're going to make a short detour. Hey. This is the old man in the forest. [mischievous music] Lieutenant. We shouldn't be here. My grandmother used to tell stories about him. I hated those stories. Calm down, Flint. Sometimes stories are just stories. And sometimes they're not. It's true. True enough. Is that the king's wolf? [laughing] Come in, come in. [laughs] Ah, and does she sleep still? Under the green, your lady love? Does she slumber? Or is her ghost walking the Borderlands, hmm? [laughing] There are many ghosts in the Borderlands, Brander Noke. But I think you seek a different one, though you know it not, huh? [laughing] You needn't ask. I don't know the answer. But I know the question already, huh? [chuckles] The future won't wait, huh? [laughing] Ah. Now. Now for an answer, yes. I don't have much use for bones and dead flesh for scrying, as some fools do. Oh, they make things clearer and sharper, but they bring the shadows with them, hmm? And we don't want that, huh? Water will have to do. Besides, we can make a soup with it afterwards. [grunts] [sighs] [inhales] Hmm. [suspenseful music] Hmm. How peculiar. How rare, how strange. No no no no, that's not the right word, not the right word at all. Ah, it is, oh, that's it, very, very odd. What's odd? Oh, odd you say, hmm? Hush. [sighs] [inhales] Hmm. Hmm. Something has awoken in the mountains. East, across the river. Something that should not have woken. It has been asleep for a very long time, and should have slept even longer. Hmm. [inhales] Ah. I see, I see death coming to the Borderlands. Death, and he brings an old blade, an old blade, and an even older hate, grim and cold from the grave. Carved with runes he wishes to wake. The shadow spawn. Beware the blood of the shadow spawn. Beware two shadows cast by an even deeper shadow. Two shadows? What do you mean, Master Malde? Can't you tell us anything more? I'm not sure. I'm generally not sure about much these days. [chuckles] Except for what I'm very sure of. Very, very sure of. Hmm. What's that? I know you must walk out my door into the rest of today and tomorrow, Brander Noke, with nothing except your sword and your courage and whatever sense you can make of these words. You must see what can be done with them, hmm? [chuckles] I'm not sure what to make of them myself. [chuckles] Perhaps my porridge will reveal more to me tomorrow morning, huh? [laughing] It is often quite instructive. [laughing] [mischievous music] What did you mean by two-- Ay ay ay ay. You don't have much time. Not much time at all. One, two days, perhaps three, I don't know. But darkness is at its root. I can feel it, hmm? [chuckles] best of luck and all that, yeah? Off you go, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah. [laughs] Off you go. [laughing] [suspenseful music] You see the wingspan on that? Must've been more than 30 feet. Ain't seen one of those since I was a kid, up on the northern range. You could see the fire burning in the mountains at night. The king sent his army and the court wizard. A lot of men died. It's been mostly quiet all this past year in the Borderlands. Some orcs here and there. There's trolls in the Brickerbrack Hills, they needed some killing. Aye. But nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing to speak of. Just a day's work. But now all this. And a dragon however big. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Is this the famous Tavern of the Wood, sir? I hear you're famous for your meats. [mumbling] I hear it's really quite good, we have coin-- Quite good? It's the best in the Borderlands. Take a seat, find a spot. Grab a seat, boys. [mumbling] [sighs] We have venison and mushroom stew, cold mutton and cheese as well. Think I'll take a wallsman's whiskey, sweetheart. Bread and cheese for me. Just beef and ale. Of course, sirs. Mm-hmm. So what do you think? Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know boss, she's easy on the eyes. But we may have spent our last coin for nothing. Maybe. Maybe not. Right. Anything else? Why yes, actually, there is. One more thing, right boys? [laughing] [suspenseful music] It's all right, lassie. What are you doing? Stay right there. What are you doing? Stay right there. [grunts] You can't take her. Back off! We can, we will, and we did. Take her. Can't do that. [bangs] More meat! All right. I have our new orders. Seems we're no longer hunting just orcs. We've got a new job. Round up any half-breeds we can find, cart 'em off to Graten Ferry. The count says it's for their own good. Problem is, I've know some breeds that aren't bad, no worse than you or me. It seems everyone is talking of shadows. They say before the shadow king could be killed, he bound his soul into his blade, that somehow his spirit could be awoken, brought back into the world. We all grew up on those stories. There are a pair of blades in those tales, if I recall. Only one blade the darkness would be interested in. The edge of souls. Nosy folk, those half-breeds, don't you think? [suspenseful music] Not a bad job tracking us, kid. But I heard you break a branch about two miles back. I can forgive the sloppy woodcraft, but eavesdropping? You got shadow elf blood in you. You're a half-breed. [somber music] Ever since my mother died, I've been running. I forgot what it's like to have a home. A place where I don't have to worry about getting my throat cut. Some say you can see the future in shadow elf blood. No one will go after a real shadow elf, but a half-breed, we're fair game. I was up in the north lands, across the river, and I could feel her. A half-breed like me, a girl. An old man had her tied up in his basement. He was some sort of hedge wizard. Ugly, evil bastard. And he was draining her dry, to see the future. And worse. I killed him. But it was too late for her. Other people, others just want to kill us because we are different. Because we are of the dark, somehow. I didn't choose who my parents were! But now, the king, the king wants us locked up? Why don't you just go ahead and kill me. I'd rather be dead than chained in some dungeon. I don't care anymore. We're not going to kill you, kid. And I'm not going to chain you up. There's something going on with the half-breeds, that's a fact. It doesn't make sense now. But we're going to find out the who and the why, and maybe we'll find something to do. For now, you come with us. [eerie music] Two more breeds, my lord. The brigands in the South are always good for a few. The orcs are late. Their tunnels in the Grimmock Mountains so far from here. Near enough, my lord. But there are elves in the way, lord. Elves. Our orcs lost warriors in a skirmish on the south banks of the Coldfell. The elven hunters are hunting greenskins throughout the forest. Our servants had to skirt south, around the lake, to shake their pursuit. [grunts] I thought our orcs were no cowards. [grunting] Irisher and his war band crossed the river earlier this day. Irisher is the bastard son of a drunken dwarf. Perhaps. But he's already hunting in the Borderlands. I have need of you there as well, this night. For your precious blood? Insolent fool! You dare speak to me directly? And in that tone. I allowed it once, creature, it will not happen again. Eyes down! [eerie music] I will drain your corpse dry for one drop of what I need. Your life means nothing to me! Nothing! You were made to serve me. Now, you will get to the Borderlands and to the hunt. You will continue to bring me half-breeds as you always have. And you'll bring them to me alive. Alive! It shall be done. A word of warning to you, Kulta Blackhand. The Rangers of the accursed king hunt the half-breeds as well. Their numbers dwindle, but they are brave men still. Brave or not, they will die by my blade. We hunt! They had better. [suspenseful music] Hey there missy, what a dreary night. What do you want? Don't be afraid, I'm just a lone hungry dwarf. I got lost in the forest. You can't stay here. My brother's just coming back, he'll be very angry, he doesn't like strangers. No, I'm not a stranger. My name is Tiberius, and I'm not lost anymore. You're not? No, I found what I'm looking for. What's that? You. [shouting] Whoa, whoa, all right, all right. There's a familiar type. Yeah, stick him. Get her? That's a big knife for a little girl, huh? Watch the knife. Come back here! She stabbed me! Run, girl! [laughing] Run! It makes it that much sweeter. Blood! She stuck you, didn't she? It's blood! Halt. Down. You see that? Orcs. Half hour old. 10, maybe 12 of them. Looks like they're headed toward Harpdale. Well, Lieutenant? Looks like we're gonna have ourselves a little get-together. Garrin and his crew will have to wait. You ever been to Harpdale before, kid? Yeah, a few times. Any breeds there? I-- Answer the damn question. You told me you can smell each other out. One. There's a farm on the edge of town. His son, but the old man doesn't know. Then that's where they're headed. Orcs can smell 'em just as well as we can. [somber music] [bird cawing] Pray tell, Brander Noke, where to? Seems you have the better of me, elf. I am Tailis, son of Nethandri. What brings the wood elves across the river? Orcs, human. You think we would lightly risk war? Peace, Celistar. It is as she says, Ranger. A band crossed the Coldfell River yesterday. There is a certain intent and purpose in them that has gained our curiosity. We're close on the trail now, as you seem to be as well. There's strange things afoot in the Borderlands, Ranger. We wish to know more, and of course, we also wish to right what is wrong by killing more orcs. As do we. We don't need your help, human. Nor we yours. Cease! Celistar. You travel with curious company, Ranger. A half-breed, do you know that? Aye. I know it. He's a good enough lad. Not all are tainted. That remains to be seen. Nevertheless, there must be a reason the orcs have come down in such force from the Grimmock Mountains, and I fear this band is not the only one. Reason or not, they can still die, and I need no reason to slay them. I seek orcs to kill, but I also seek the reason behind the reason. And I think you seek the same. Shall we go hunting, Brander Noke? [adventurous music] [suspenseful music] [speaking foreign language] What news? Orders from the northern border. You're needed at the front. Rangers? The northern border will have to wait. You're coming with us. [shouting] [dramatic music] [shouting indistinctly] [serene music] [shouts] [squelches] [orcs growling] [somber music] [grunting] [insects chirping] May you reach the heavens in peace. And what of the boy? He shall have a home with our people. Aye. His blood makes him a cousin of sorts, however distant. He's young and still he has time to choose rightly. We head out, then. Have a care, Brander Noke, for the shadows are stirring. And keep an eye on your young charge. The orcs found him of interest, did they not? Fare thee well, Rangers, fare thee well. Fare thee well. [bird cawing] [suspenseful music] You're safe now, girl. Safe? [eerie music] [Sabine screams] [bird cawing] [suspenseful music] What do you think, Sarge? 20, maybe more? Oh, they're close. The bastards ain't far. Getting into night, Sarge, and our orders were to wait here for the lieutenant. This ain't no orc raiding party, Sarge. This is an orc war band. We drop gear here. Tighten up on anything that moves. I was four when those green-skinned bastards came to our farm. Killed my ma, and my pa. Four, brothers. Now some other little boy is out there, waiting for the same destiny that faced me. A boy whose life will change forever if we don't get at it. Brothers, it's what we do, and there are plenty for each of us. I say we hit them hard. And we hit them on the run. Keep them confused. Rangers! [grunting] Let's move out. I like killing orcs. [orc roars] [suspenseful music] [grunts] There's blood on the wind here. Human, my lord. Rangers. [roars] [somber music] [gulls cawing] Your majesty. Ah, Count Thrace. I have heard of certain happenings in the Borderlands. Happenings, your majesty? Orcs. Orcs crossing the river. Who knows what still lives under the Grimmock Mountains. Perhaps now is the time to call out the heralds, rally the troops, even ride to war. I'm afraid, my lord, there's no need for all that. It's true, there are the occasional orcs this side of the river, but that's nothing out of the ordinary. The Rangers are more than up to the task. My Rangers? Perhaps. Good men, but... Still, it would be like old times. Remember those days, Thrace? Days before cares and matters of state put us in these chairs? Aye, my lord, all too well. Riding out, sword, spear, taking the field, brothers in arms. [swords clanging] [horse neighs] We were young once. Young. And brave. I have full faith in the Rangers, my lord. Hmm. Very well, Thrace. Your Rangers. [thumps] [insects chirping] [indistinct chattering] Garrin should've been here. Maybe he stopped at Blackfold. Good tavern there. You would know, right? Lieutenant, take a look here. Orcs. Northeast. Follow. That's Garrin's hand. A bit dark to be tracking orcs. What do we do? We follow, of course. [sighs] [dramatic music] [orcs growling] [shouting] [crying] [shouts] Help me, please help me, help me please. Please. [shouting] [insects chirping] This weren't no ordinary pack. No, sure weren't. It was a war band. And now we've got ourselves a lot of dead kin here. [suspenseful music] They looted the bodies. Garrin. You should've waited. [thumps] Lieutenant, ain't that yours?
