And whoever is blinded from remembrance of the Most Merciful. We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a companion. "...qala, say, raaitu, I saw, the Prophet Muhammad, tawaddhaa, perform wudu, faghasala yadaihi, and wash both hands, tsumma tamasymadha..." Zahra, wake up! Allah, have mercy. It's dawn, time for morning prayer. Oh, dear God. Usually, it's you who'd wake us up. Maybe she pulled an all-nighter memorizing Quran verses? The Most Compassionate taught the Quran, created humanity, and taught them speech. The sun and the moon travel with precision. Allah Almighty speaks the truth. Praise be to God. Well done, Tiara. Next? Who's ready? Zahra, Ummi. In the name of Allah, The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Universe. Young lady, another cellphone? This is the third one. Did you learn nothing? This is bad for your soul! What should I do with it this time? Do you know why you're wrong? Do you? Good. Allah, have mercy. Okay? Don't do it again. Zahra, you got another nightmare? I read an article on the internet. Nightmares mean you have something on your mind. When you fall asleep thinking about something, you'll end up dreaming about it. Ummi Hana. - Peace be upon you, Ummi Hana. - Peace be upon you, too. - Peace be upon you, Ummi. - Finished with your morning prayer? - Yes. - Yes, Ummi. Good, peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. Zahra. Can you see me after class? Yes, Ustaz, God willing. I mean, his wife was right there. Maybe she gave him her blessing? Enough with the jokes! Not funny at all. Sorry, we were kidding. Zahra! AL HIKMAH GIRLS' DORMITORY PATRON - DORMITORY MANAGER Yolanda. Your mother left you here with us, so you can learn to be a better person. And to gain useful knowledge for your future. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. Come in. Zahra, meet Yolanda. She's the new student who will stay and study here. Yolanda, this is Zahra. She's a senior and head of the class. Our most hardworking and responsible student. All the teachers love her. She will help you to catch up on your studies. Right, Zahra? God willing, Ustaz. Let me show you around. Peace be upon you, Ustaz. Peace be upon you, too. Look... That's Zahra with a new girl. This is the bathroom area. The dormitory is over there. Two floors. We stay on the first. That's the mosque and the classrooms. And the exit? Is the front gate the only way out? Are there more? There are, the gate next to the classrooms. Why? This area is for seniors only. No freshmen and sophomores. Two of the teachers here are Ustaz Jaelani and Ummi Yana. Yolanda, here are some readings for your studies. They are Icha dan Gendhis. Right. The lights are out after 10:00 p.m. So we can rest better. After morning prayer, we'd gather to recite Quran verses and hadiths. Let me know if you need anything. Thanks. Good God, Yolanda. Your hair looks so pretty! Don't get any ideas. You can't pull it off. Hey! - No way! - Icha. Why did you move here from Jakarta? My mom sent me. I won't be here long, anyway. Meaning? Do you have Wi-Fi here? This is no place for Wi-Fi. But we do have an internet caf√©. I often go there with Icha here. To meet with her boyfriend, Yafi. Icha! Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. - Peace be upon you, too, Ummi. Ummi. Yolanda, this is Ummi Yana, our prefect. Please. Yolanda. Welcome to our dormitory. Let me get that. Every student must keep their room and the environment clean. And also observe all the rules. Understood? Understood, Ummi. Okay then, peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. Want some help? Come on, Gendhis, hurry. Wait up. Oh no! Sorry, Yolanda, I'm so clumsy. My amulet, to keep me safe. Go on, take your showers. Gendhis, let's go. Come, Jiji, let's take a shower. The jinn that accompanies him says, "Our Lord, I did not make them transgress. Rather, they were far astray on their own." A demon walks side by side with a human. Assigned to accompany them. The Qorin jinn. Allah, have mercy. What was that? Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. What is your purpose? - Allah, have mercy. Laras? - Laras? Allah, have mercy. Allah, have mercy. - Allah, have mercy. - Pray to Allah. Did you hear him? Something strange in the way he performed the exorcism. I've never heard those verses before. Right? Different, right? Those are not verses. Sounds like local Sundanese tongue. I don't understand it, though. Did you hear it, Zahra? I wasn't paying attention. I was busy reciting the al-Kursi verse. I'd say that was fake as hell. Maybe those kids were just bored and craving for attention. Right? Yolanda. Not believing is your business. But one thing you should know, such incidents show that humans are weak creatures. We need help from Allah. That's what Kyai Mustofa always teaches us. And where is Kyai Mustofa now? He has many followers. So the villagers asked him for help with the local leaders election. Gendhis, you shouldn't gossip about the Kyai like that. But she asked, Zahra. Zahra! Allah, have mercy. Did you have a bad dream? Do you wet yourself? What are you two doing up? Did you wet your bed? I had too much water. Allah is greater. Allah is greater. Allah is greater. Allah is greater. Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah. Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah. I seek forgiveness from Allah. What's wrong with her? - Yolanda. - I seek forgiveness from Allah. There is no God but Allah, the One, having no partner with Him. GIRLS' DORMITORY Yolanda, is that your cellphone? Greetings! Peace be upon you and Allah's mercy and blessings. May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be with you too. Pass these to those behind you. Tonight we will have a Qorin test. QORIN What? Qorin? "Qorin"? "A jinn who accompanies and resembles humans." You will summon and meet your Qorin jinn. Learning high-level spiritualism is our way of shedding our worldly logics. Knowledge is about benefits. So why should we limit ourselves from obtaining such benefits? Ustaz. So what's the benefit of summoning the Qorin jinn? If you're still questioning this, it means you are not ready to study here. And you are not ready to receive knowledge from your teacher. Zahra. Please organize the session. One thing you should know, this test is mandatory. In order to graduate. SUMMONING QORIN PRACTICAL EXAM REQUIREMENTS NAIL CUTTINGS - HAIR CUTTINGS BURIAL SHROUD - A LIME - ABLUTION BATH Any questions? No, Ustaz. Take a look at her. Doesn't she look like Sri? She does. Sri has already been married off. - Married? - With whom? - Are you talking about me? - Wow, don't flatter yourself. - So why were you pointing? - Nothing, you look like Sri. Who's Sri? Stop talking nonsense. Hey, easy with the tone! Come on now. Come on. - It's not nice to gossip about people. - Yeah! Don't take it personally. Who's Sri? She was a student here. But when she became a senior, she got expelled. Why? She attacked Ujay. Attacked? Maybe she was provoked? I have no idea. But she was a loner, that girl. Wonder where she is now. And where's Icha, by the way? She was here just now. You should've kept your distance. Icha, come on! If Ummi Yana finds out, we'll get in trouble. Just a minute. Baby. How could you say that? I said I was sorry. Won't you forgive me? Icha! I have to go. Icha. Gendhis, where's Yolanda? No idea. Honey. My father sent this blessed water. He hopes this would help us to have a baby soon. Please, drink it. How are the girls? Zahra looked agitated yesterday. What's going on? Seniors. Their final exams are coming. They must have a lot on their minds. Why did you ask? Should I have a talk with them? Maybe I could help ease their burden. Leave the students to me. You just focus on staying healthy. Mia, have you seen Yolanda? - Yolanda? - Have you seen her? - No. - I haven't seen her. Let's go over there. Yolanda, what are you doing? Get her inside. Come on. Bury this right away. Zahra, what's that? Someone is coming. Zahra, come on. Why is it so hard to cut this nail? Stop collecting these! Hey! Yolanda! What are you doing? - Zahra! - Hey! What are you doing? I got no fingernails left. Don't you think something strange is going on? The possessed girls were brought inside the shack, and they were told to collect these shrouds, too. What are you talking about? But if we don't do this what happens to our final grade? She's right. You sure we'll be safe? Look! Allah, have mercy. I'm scared, Zahra. What do we do? What do we do, Zahra? Allah, have mercy. What should we do then? Oh, dear God. - What do you think? - And then what happens? What are we supposed to do? Zahra, if this puts us in danger, can't you talk with him? Zahra, please. Zahra, you're the only one he'll listen to. This is non-negotiable. We have no other choice. Fine, nothing we can do. I'm in, I guess. If the others are in... I'm in, too. All right, I'll list your names. So we can collect the shrouds before sundown. See you later, Yolanda. Why, Zahra? If we feel something is not right, why should we obey them? It's all right, if you don't want to. Zahra. I just hope you're right. That it's just a regular test. In the name of Allah, In the name of Allah, have mercy on the unseen, have mercy on the unseen, the heavens, the heavens, and the earth, and the earth, may Allah may Allah make you see. Make you see. Toss it! Let it go! Surrender yourself. Surrender your Qorin. Let go! Toss it! In the name of Allah, may Allah make you see. Toss it! Toss it! Surrender! In the name of Allah... Toss it! Surrender! In the name of Allah, may Allah make you see. Toss it! May Allah make you see. In the name of Allah... ...make you see. Toss it! Let it go! Surrender yourself. Surrender your Qorin. Yolanda. Sorry I got angry with you. Zahra. If something bad happens... we have to fight. Don't be scared. TREATISE ON JINN Honey? Honey? Hana! What are you doing out this late? You need to rest. Why are you keeping this in the drawer? None of your business. Just trust me. Honey. Honey. My father would never let anyone learn or practice the arts of jinn, if they are not ready. Your father? Enough with your father! Your father is not here! He doesn't even care about this school! Father is here, honey. This is his school. Wherever he is, he'll protect this school without having to pray to idols. Who says anything about idols? Then what's this? What's this? I never believed what Sri and the other students told me. What are you doing with them? Allah, have mercy. Who's there? Icha. My God. Allah, have mercy. You scared me, Icha. Icha, I'm going now. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Icha? Weren't you just in the bathroom? No, she's here all the time. She still got her period. Zahra? What's wrong with you? What about you, Zahra? You get sent to Ujay's room often, right? Zahra? What's wrong, Zahra? You got something to tell me? Zahra? If you have something to tell me, then tell me. No need to be scared. We'll work it out together. Okay? But how? I'll call the police. The police won't believe me. They'll say we're making this up. Fine, then we'll show the proof to Ummi Yana. We have proof. If Ummi Yana sees your phone, she'll confiscate it. This is a bigger issue than that. Let's call Kyai Mustofa. He's the only way out. Zahra. If you're still scared, I can do this alone. Yolanda. I'm coming with you. Peace be upon you. Okay. YOLANDA, NEW STUDENT, GIRLS DORMITORY - CIKAPUNDUNG, WANT TO REPORT HERESY PRACTICED BY USTAZ JAELANI Peace be upon you. Where is everyone? Not this one. Where is it? Here it is. Yolanda. Wait a minute, Ummi. I have something to show you on my phone. - No need, you know the rules. - But you have to see what Ujay did... I'm in charge of this school and dormitory. You are my responsibility. You're here to be a pious, obedient student. - But... - Not to defy me and your teacher. So I have to obey when Ujay is abusing us? You have to see the proof. The video is right here. I'm not lying. Here, Ummi. Go back to your room. Yolanda. Yolanda. Yolanda. Yolanda. Where were you? Why didn't you look out for me? I'm sorry. I saw Sri. Sri? But you all said Sri is gone. So, she came back? What's wrong with you? I want to get out of here as soon as possible. But it's not that easy. It's easy, if you're not overthinking it. And shed your model student title. What are you two talking about? Now you're keeping secrets from me? Immature. What's going on, Zahra? Yafi, I'm sorry. - Why didn't you say something sooner? - Yafi, let go. You're hurting me! Let go. What were you waiting for? Yafi, it hurts. - Yafi, let go! - Stop screaming! - Hey! - Allah, have mercy. If a girl says no, you let go. Stay out of this, mind your own business. I don't like it when someone's hurting my friend. Did you tell her? I knew it. You really can't trust a girl when she's not a virgin. - What is it about? - My God, don't say that. Hands off her. It's not allowed! Get out of here! What the hell? Baby, don't go! Yolanda! What's wrong with you? - Stay out of my business. - What are you on, Icha? How can you fall for such a douchebag? What do you know? Hey, don't be a fool for love. You'll be sorry. At least, I have someone out there who still cares about me. Unlike you! As head of the class. I can simply rely on you to organize the other. Why... would Yolanda say I'm teaching you dark arts? What I taught you is useful for you girls. You learn how to control yourself. Yes, Ustaz. Good then, you know you're wrong. But... I won't have it if any more of your friends reaches out to Kyai or Ummi Yana. I'm sure you don't want... your friends to find out... what we were doing in the shack. Sorry, I didn't see you. I said no at first. But he kept insisting. Until finally... I gave in. But I was wrong. His attention is not only to me. But to the other students, too. I thought his attention... was sincere. That's not attention, Icha. He's taking advantage of us. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I don't know. I know you have a lot on your mind. I can't possibly talk to Gendhis. It'll be too much for her. I only told Yafi. Icha, we have to be brave and fight. You must be brave, Icha. All right? We and the others have to fight. Okay? Promise me? I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. What's going on? Icha? Zahra? Hi, Gendhis. It's nothing. Where have you been? I got diarrhea. Gendhis. Are you taking diet pills again? No. I ate too much chili peppers. Serves me right. You're not a good liar, you know. Why are you two crying? Icha? Nothing. Allah, have mercy. Icha? Icha? This way, you will obey me. Oh my God, Jiji! - Oh my God! - Calm down, Gendhis. Allah, have mercy! Excuse me. Jiji! Gendhis, what happened? Gendhis, don't! I hate you, Yolanda! You did this, didn't you? Gendhis! Oh my God, it's dangerous! - Calm down! - Quiet, Zahra! She killed Jiji! I swear to God, it wasn't me. Then whose knife is this? Gendhis, listen to me! Please, believe me. Yolanda didn't do it! Zahra, whose knife is this? I don't know, but Yolanda didn't do it. Calm down, Gendhis! What's wrong with you, Zahra? Standing up for the new girl. Why don't you stand up for your friend? You're impossible! Everyone, listen to me! We shouldn't be accusing each other like this. We should be fighting... - Icha! - I'm scared! Icha, I'm scared! Stay on the ground until you've thought about what you all did. I shall not bow down to you. You are the same as me, we both come from hell. I shall not bow down to you. It was I who lifted you up from hell, so you are obliged to be my follower. It was I who lifted you up from hell, so you are obliged to be my follower. Jaelani. Icha... Gendhis. You okay? Allah, have mercy. Stop this. These poor girls. Jaelani, let them go back to their rooms. They are my followers. This is my business and no one else's. Peace be upon you. Hana! Hana! Hana! Hana! KIAI MUSTOFA The number you are calling is inactive. Please try again in few minutes. Sri... Wake up, Sri! Sri. Forgive me, Sri. Hana. Hana. Honey. Your father made me do this, Hana. Your father never considered my existence. Your father always looked down on me. He never believes me. It's impossible to make a demon bow down and follow him. There is no God but Allah. There is no God but Allah. There is no God but Allah. There is no God but Allah. There is no God but Allah... There is no God but Allah. I seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed. In the name of Allah, The Most Gracious and The Most Merciful. Allah, there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of all existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the Earth. Hana. Honey, everything will be over soon. Everybody will obey me, and will become mine. Malik! Get Kyai Mustofa's body out and bury him now! Didn't you all feel stiff this afternoon? Allah, have mercy. Thank goodness Icha has calmed down. Jiji, please forgive me. Dear Allah, please forgive me. I couldn't take care of Jiji. Gendhis. Please believe me. Yolanda didn't do it. It wasn't even one of us. Zahra, I just lost Jiji. I've never had a friend before. You all never include me in anything. I always get bullied. I'm ostracized for looking like I do. Gendhis. I may not have an idea... what you're going through right now. But I lost someone, too. I almost killed myself... when my boyfriend died. I was violated. I was strangled, I couldn't breathe. I pushed him over the edge of a cliff. I didn't do it on purpose. They called me a murderer. I wasn't strong enough... to live with the guilt. I wasn't ready to lose him. I took all the pills the doctor gave me. I overdosed. I just want to say... I'm sorry, Gendhis. I'm sorry you lost Jiji. But I swear to God I would never have hurt Jiji. But no one knows if you killed him by accident or as an excuse. - No one knows, right? - Gendhis! Gendhis. Even if I'm capable of killing, I'd rather kill myself, Gendhis. Fine, why don't you go and do it then? Oh my God! Gendhis, Yolanda, enough! Pull yourself together, Gendhis. Allah, have mercy. Icha? - Icha? - She's crazy. Icha! Icha! Stop it, Icha! Don't do it! Icha, stop it! Help me please! Help me! Allah, have mercy! Zahra! Help me! Get the rope in my bag! Zahra, hurry up! Where is it? Rope in my bag! Yolanda, where is it? In the middle one! Take her arm! Yolanda! Pull yourself together! Pull yourself together, Icha! We need to get help! Zahra! Zahra, look at me! Let's go get help! We have to find Ummi Yana. Yes, let's go! Take this. Come, Gendhis! It's okay. You guys go. - I'll stay and watch Icha. - Fine, let's go! We'll come back to you! Come on, Zahra! Be careful! Allah, have mercy. I need your pin. Have you seen Ummi Yana? Where's Ummi Yana? Those are the Qorin jinns, not our friends. Yolanda! Help! Oh, God! - Zahra! - Oh, God! Icha? Icha? Icha? Icha? Peace be upon you, dweller of hell. Allah, have mercy. TREATISE ON JINN TREATISE ON JINN SUMMONING PROCEDURES OF THE QORIN JINN I'm doing all this because I love you, Icha. Icha. Icha. Icha. Icha. Zahra! There is no God but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Wake up! It's me, Zahra. Ummi... Ummi, I've been looking for you... What is it, Zahra? I'm sorry, Ummi. This is all my fault. Zahra! This is not your fault, all right? It's my fault. Ustaz Jaelani... Ustaz Jaelani sexually assaulted me, Ummi. Not just me, many girls. Other students were assaulted, including Icha. I didn't know how to tell you. I was scared. I was scared no one would believe me. Zahra? No, please don't. No, Jiji! No, please don't. Please stop. Allah is greater. There is no God but Allah. There is no God but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. There is no God but Allah. There is no God but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. You okay? Ummi! Ummi! Icha and Yolanda are not here. I have to go find them. Yes. Be careful. - Yes, Ummi. - Be careful. No, please don't. Gendhis! Gendhis! Pull yourself together, Gendhis! Pull yourself together, Gendhis! Ummi, help me! Gendhis! No, please don't. - No, please don't. - Allah, have mercy. Gendhis? Oh my God! The needle of hell has been freed. It's me, Ummi. Gendhis is here. Yolanda, it's me. What happened? Allah, have mercy. Ummi... No one leaves the mosque area. Understood? Understood, Ummi. Zahra, let's clean up Icha's body. Poor Icha. I'm scared. Icha... Ummi... Ummi, I can't do this, I'm sorry, Ummi. Zahra, please... Zahra... Ummi... Calm yourself down. No need to be scared. I'm your teacher. Trust me. If you do this with sincerity... it's proof of your devotion to your teacher. Stay away! If you come close, I swear I'll stab you! It's no use, Zahra. Don't you want to graduate first in class? No! I just want to get out of here! Impossible, Zahra. What would people out there say? You are not pure anymore. What would your mother say? Come here, Zahra... don't be afraid. You don't have what it takes, Zahra. You will never be brave enough to fight me. If you come closer, this goes into my throat. Zahra? Zahra? I'm tainted, Yolanda. No one will ever accept me. I can't get what happened out of my mind. I'm here. We'll make everything better. Remember, you told Icha... that we can fight Ujay together. For Icha. I'm here. Ummi Yana is here. Gendhis is here. Allah is with us. Now we have to get out of here, fast! I worship this Qorin as it is greater than Allah. O Qorin, accept my devotion. There they will have fruits and whatever they desire.
