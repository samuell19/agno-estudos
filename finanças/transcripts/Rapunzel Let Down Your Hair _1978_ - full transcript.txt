WOMAN READS: Each one as queen, mother, huntress Though each remembers little of it And some remember nothing at all Resting in crazy houses From the long spin of history Drinking the grief of their sex Eating it in bitter pills Muttering in kitchens Telling their daughters The story of a sleeping princess But knowing it takes more than a man's kiss To wake one so bent on sleeping her life away. CHATTER WOMAN READS: Rapunzel. There once lived a man and a woman who had long wanted a child, and they believed that at last, their wish would come true. They lived in a house with a small window at the back, which looked out on a wonderful garden full of the finest flowers and vegetables. But it was surrounded by a high wall, and nobody dared go in for it belonged to a powerful witch who was feared throughout the land. One day, when the woman was standing at this window, she saw a bed planted with the most beautiful rapunzels. They looked so fresh and green that she was overcome with the desire to eat some. Her desire increased every day, and since she could not get any, she pined away and grew pale and miserable. "If I don't have any rapunzels," she moaned, "I shall die." The man was worried, and thought to himself, "I can't lose my wife. "I must get some rapunzels, whatever they cost." That night, at dusk, he sneaked into the garden, snatched a handful of plants and took them to his wife, who quickly made herself a salad. It was so delicious that the next day, she longed for more. So the man climbed the garden once again, and as he was climbing back, the witch suddenly jumped in front of him. Her eyes blazed with anger as she shouted, "How dare you climb into my garden "and steal my rapunzels?!" "I know I've done wrong," the man pleaded, "but pity me. "My wife wanted your rapunzels so much "that she would have died if she hadn't eaten them." "Well, if that's the truth," the witch replied, "I'll let you take all the rapunzels you want "on one condition - "you must give me your child when it's born. "It'll have a good life, "and I'll look after it like a mother." In his terror, the man agreed, and when the child was born, the witch took her away and named her Rapunzel. And Rapunzel was the most beautiful child under the sun. But when she was 12 years old, the witch locked her up in a tower in the midst of a wood. It had neither doors nor steps, but only one small window at the very, very top. That's it. There's the window, where Rapunzel can look out of. READS: When the witch wanted to get in, she stood under the window and called, "Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!" Rapunzel had long, blonde hair that shone like gold, and when she heard the witch calling, she would let it down to the ground so the old woman could climb up. A few years later, a prince was riding through the forest and he heard Rapunzel singing as he passed by the tower. The prince longed to see her, and searched for a door, but the tower hadn't got one. He couldn't forget her voice, and he came to listen to her every single day. One day, he saw the witch going into the tower. "If that's the ladder," he thought, "then I will climb it." And when it was dark, he went to the tower and he called, "Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!" And the hair fell down and he climbed up. Rapunzel was terrified, cos she'd never seen a man. But when the prince spoke gently to her about how her song had moved him, Rapunzel thought, "Well, he will love me better than the old woman." And she put her hands in his and said, "I wish I could go with you, but I can't get out. "Each time you come, bring a roll of silk, "and I will weave a ladder "so that we can escape together on your horse." They agreed that he should come to her each night, as the old woman came in the daytime. The witch knew nothing of this, until, one day, Rapunzel said to her, "Tell me, why are you so much harder to lift "than the prince who comes every night?" "Ah! Wicked child!" cried the witch. "I thought I'd hidden you from everyone, "but you have betrayed me. The witch was so angry that she snatched up a pair of scissors in her right hand, seized Rapunzel's hair in her left and - snip, snap - the beautiful hair fell to the ground. And she was so hard-hearted that she carried the girl off to the endless desert and left her to look after herself. On that same day, she returned to the tower, fastened the chopped-off hair to a window hook, and that evening, the prince came as usual and called, "Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair!" The hair fell down and he climbed up, but instead of Rapunzel, he found the witch staring at him with evil, glittering eyes. "The bird has flown," she sneered. "The cat has got it. "It will scratch out your eyes, as well. "Forget Rapunzel. You will never see her again." In his sorrow, the prince threw himself from the tower. He wasn't killed, but his eyes were pierced by thorns and he was blinded. After wandering several years, grieving over the loss of Rapunzel, he came at last to the desert where Rapunzel lived with the twins that she had borne. When Rapunzel saw him coming, she called out his name, and he knew it was her voice. And as they kissed, two of her tears touched his eyes and he could see again. And then he took her and the children to his kingdom, where they lived long and happily. Did you enjoy that story? Mm, there was one more page. One more page, and that's the last page.

Part of our history as women died with them. CHURCH BELL CHIMES The witch is a symbol of female power. In a patriarchy, she is transformed into a symbol of male psychic terror. He may think of her as young and dangerous... ...but she is usually represented as old and repulsive, her sex withered with age. These negative images can also be deeply embedded in our own unconscious... ..where they affect how we think about ourselves as women. Witches are still strongly associated with aspects of female sexuality that are usually kept silent and hidden. The womb, menstruation, childbirth. The history of the witch is ancient, dating back to the great pre-biblical fertility goddesses, whose cults were kept alive by witches in the Middle Ages. But as the Christian Church consolidated its hold on medieval Europe, the witch became known as Satan's sister. Female sexuality was called evil, and practising the old fertility-based religions was condemned as heresy. The Medieval Church also outlawed the practice of secular medicine. Witches were often the village wisewoman, skilled in herbal medicine, and the only doctors available to the peasants. They performed abortions and they were midwives who had drugs to ease labour pains in an age when church doctrine maintained that all women should suffer for Eve's original sin. The Church was on the defensive and made the witches its scapegoat. The witch-hunts were well-organised, legalistic campaigns, waged jointly by the Church and the state. As such, they constitute a victory for the ruling classes since the poor came to believe that they were the victims of witches and devils, rather than of princes and popes. It is nearly impossible to estimate the total number of victims. Figures go as high as nine million, and most of those killed were women. Any woman was suspect on grounds of her sex alone. Since she was presumed guilty from the outset, she would be tortured at length to extract a confession. We do know that, between the years 1542 and 1722, the English witch-hunts claimed 1,000 victims, 4,000 people were killed in Scotland, and that 400 people were burned as witches in a single day in Toulouse.

Well, you're a grown woman now and you can make these decisions for yourself. I expect you'll come round to telling her in your own good time. What have you been using up till now? Well, that's just it - nothing. I didn't mean to do it, but I thought if I didn't, he'd get fed up with me. Don't let yourself get pressurised into it.

I've come about my periods. I... For two weeks out of every four or five, I'm hysterical, I'm insane. I scream at the kids and fight with my husband and I... I don't know what to do any more about it. Is there nothing you can do? I keep getting cystitis, but my present doctor, he just laughs and says, "You can only get it from intercourse." You see, he knows I'm a lesbian and I think that's why he won't treat me. I'm pregnant again and I've come to you because I just can't face going back to that hospital I went to last time.

I should have known. Why the secrecy? You should have come to me. You really should have been more careful. I couldn't come to you. I didn't think you'd understand. What do you mean I wouldn't understand? Have you any idea how hard it is to bring up a child? You'll ruin your life. I have to make my own life. You can't make it for me. I want this child. And I want to live with Michael. How could you do this to me, after all I've taught you? Mother, I don't want to hurt you. I want to do something for me. Please understand. I have thought about it. It's what I want. You always said a woman should know her own mind. Yes. Yes, I suppose I have. Look, it's late and we're both tired. We'll have a talk about it again and work something out.
