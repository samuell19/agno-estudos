Show me some favouritism, there, Ray. Nice ones, now, Ray. Something a little special there, Ray. Who's shy? Who's shy? - It's me, it's me, sorry. - Every time. Who's next? Oh. Okay, let's look at this. Oh, Ray, you're off to to give me a hand of feet here. I hope no one can open. These fuckin' cards are ridiculous. Ah, sure, let's open. Can opener. Can I get a beer, Frank? In the fridge there, will you? I'll deal for you when you're gone there, eh? Yeah, give me three. - Surprise. - Okay. Don't forget me! I wish I could. I'm trying. Right. Well, what does he have? -Come on, this is mean. -Three jacks or something, okay? And give me three queens. I have a jack. Three jacks for Raymondo. One, two, three queens for you. Now, right. We waited. - Right, let's. - Ray, love, would you flush the jacks? -Where'd you get her? -We don't know, but we're trying to give her to you. -Now, are we all right? -Yeah. Um, well, I was going for something, doesn't matter what it was, that's irrelevant. And I brought in three little jackeroonies. My God, you won a hand. Looks like your luck is changing. Mm-hmm. For the worse. Dee-dum! Oh, for fuck's sake! Papla win, Papla win. Not so fast, my feathered friend. Now... Three wise men The gold, frankincense... -Ka-bloom! -No way! This is the best hand I had all night. Do you know what you are? My little bollocks. If you can't play without cheating, -you just shouldn't play. -Hold on, hold on. Who's cheating? I learnt everything I know - from the maestro. - I mean, what's the point of playing cards if you're gonna cheat? It's just stupid. We're Italian, Ray. Okay, my deal. And, Joe, it's my... Joe. Joe! -Hmm. -Come on. Quarter past seven. Let's go. I love this. What? I love being in here before youse are open. Why? I don't know. No one else can come in. It's like... It's like a little fuckin' privilege, you know? I like sneaky things. -I love anything sneaky. -Who's that? Konigsburg, one of the world's most eminent philosophers, visiting our college, where I'm gonna take him down a peg. Or two. How are you gonna do that? -With that. -See you later, Ray. See you, Joe. Do you know what? Your brother does my fuckin' head in! What? What? Quarter after nine. Oh, thanks. Great. You want a lift? Is that your best offer? Well, I've got to give a lecture. -Lecture me. -I'll tell you what. You get your coat, and I'll give you a tutorial. -In the car. -Have to be quick. -Usually is. -Just get your fuckin' coat, would you? I don't like messers because I don't like messing. And the classic... ...is the one smart fella that tries to drag the other fellas that aren't so smart down with him because he likes a mess. Well, I'll tell you now, boys, I'll make it my mission to ensure that the monkey boys don't encourage the civilised fellas up for a swing in the branches. Oh, dear God, who have we here, huh? The new boy. The late Damien Fitzgibbon. Oh, oh, oh. Stay where you are, stay there. I see they kept you the best seat in the house, right up the front next to me, huh? Stay where you are. Stay where you are. Are you a messer, boy? In my classroom, you're innocent until proven guilty, and you will be proven guilty. Sit down. I tell you, boys, when I get home, I scrub myself from top to bottom to kill the monkey germs. How are you, Mick? Hard old life, ain't it? Smoked and a large, please, Frank. No! -Frank Sinatra! -Smoked and a large? I think you're thinking about the sexy ladies, are ya? -Yeah, I must be. -Yeah, you must be. Ah, the Frank man, huh? I think you'd be avoiding me, do ya? Huh? Look at the face! Sure, I'm only messing with ya. You know Charlie, the nephew? Hello! -Charlie's doing a bit of work for me, aren't ya? -Yeah. How are you finding it? Not the worst job in the world, huh? Yeah, it's great. Listen, when are you coming down to see me, huh? Give you a man's job, huh? Proper wages. -Yeah, you know, Mr McCurdie... -Sit down, sit down, sit down. Now... How are you? I'm good, yeah. -Good. -Yeah? Because... I like having a few lads around, you know? Keeps the shit away from the bookies. Get the old van out, deliver a few briquettes, you know? Yeah. Mr McCurdie, it's my da, you know. -I mean, he needs me here, you know? -I know how you feel. I'm terribly fond of your dad, you know? But I just kept thinking about you last night. There's nothing for a fella like you staying in a town like this, you know, there really isn't. Why don't you do a bit of graft for me, eventually, I can put you into the cyber cafe in the city Centre, you know? -You should think about it. -Yeah. No, really though. I mean, really think about it. I will, yeah. Good man, good man. Listen... -...go get a drink for yourself. -No. -Go on, go on. -No. No, it's fine. Okay, okay, okay. I respect that. Right. I'll let you get off. Tell your dad we're away, will you? -Okay. Okay. -Good man. - Finish that up there, will you? - Da! -Have to earn a few bob. -Da! - Are youse away? - We're away, George. Quite a lovely young man. Sure, I'd be lost without him. I know you would. A fella like that's hard to find. I'm jealous of ya. Hmm. All right, so, when are you coming down to me? I'm sorry, I didn't get down earlier. I'm waiting on a fella for the car. Oh, yeah, no problem, no problem, but just get down, you know? Keep it steady, regular payments, that's that. -Nice to see you. Yeah. -Right, right. Bye, bye, Charlie, bye, Charlie. Bye. What? Don't be wiping your hands for that pig! What? I'm sorry that I'm late. Petrol, out of it. And right, straight to business. And, now, the... -That's good. -I told you. This meeting is to finalise the details of Konigsburg's visit. Eh, we are, of course, all very, very pleased to have managed to get him. It is an honour, so the first thing that we need is a nice delegation to come with me to the airport to meet him. So, er, volunteers? Oh, good. Six. Right, okay. Er, now, er... There's no-go, Ray, on the questions, I'm afraid. -He's not taking any questions. -What? He can't... He's not taking any questions. - That's insane. - I don't think he should have to answer any questions. He's 90 years of age, Ray. He'll be exhausted from his lectures. What, you, you don't think that would be a little bit undemocratic, Trish? You know, listening to somebody banging on for hours and hours without being allowed to question it? Not to mention, the importance of discussion to the progress of ideas... Well, now, it's not our fault, Ray. I know how much you were looking forward to this, we all were. Um... I myself would personally love to see you grill him, but... Well, it is his choice, and, so, all of this is purely, um, academic. Okay. Well, I just don't see the point in continuing the pursuit of truth and knowledge under these conditions. - Ray, come on. - How noble. Konigsburg is going down, and I'm the man that's going to do it. -Ray. -Do you realise how sad that sounds? I don't care. I don't care. What is the phrase I cannot stand? That the assassination was the match which lit a steadily increasing pile of tinder, sir. That's right, son. Now, why don't I like that phrase? Beneventi! Because it's in the book, sir. Because it's in the book, sir. Now, why don't I like the phrases in the book? Duignan. Because every eejit in the land will write them in the exam, sir. That's right, son. And half of youse will still go ahead and write it, -won't you, Logan? -Yes, sir. Yes, sir. And what have we here, sir? Oh-ho! Filthy drawings, huh? Dirty pictures. Was that your best subject at your last school? -No. -"No, sir," or, "No, Mr Fanning." No, Mr Fanny. What did you say? No, sir. You being smart at me, boy? No, sir. Stand up! Is this how you see women? Because I won't have this around me, and I certainly won't have it in one of my classes, do you hear me? Do you hear me? -Do you hear me? -Yeah! -Yes, what? -Yes, sir. Sit down, don't let me catch you with this filth again. Right. Can you give me another cause for the First World War, Rooney? Imperialism, sir. Can you not be a little bit more vague, Rooney? No? -Two snack boxes, please. -Two snack boxes. Hey, Sargent, you caught any criminals today at all? Fairly slow today, Larry. Yeah, but it wasn't so slow when you were out chasing Republicans all over the place was it? Huh? And only trying to set poor old Ireland free. You fuckin' treacherous bitch! Larry, Larry, Larry, Larry, out now. Out. Come on, come on, come on. I told you before! I told you before! There's a line. Now get out. Sleep it off. I'm very sorry about that, Sergeant. Why is everyone in this town always pissed, Frank, huh? No direction. You wouldn't think of the guards, Frank, no? I don't think I'll be brilliant at taking orders in all fairness, Sergeant, you know? Oh, we'd knock that out of ya. That's what you do here, all day. -Huh? -Take orders. What, you're, you're... You're trying to destroy my self-esteem here now, is that what you're doing now? -Well, I'm just trying to give you some. -Hmm. Have you, um... Have you been out in that new place in Lusk? No, I stay local. I was thinking about going some night. If you fancy. Some night. Yeah. What night, though? Because, um, I have to, I have to paint the bathroom ceiling. -What are, a week night? -You do me a favour, Frank? -Yeah? -Don't have a heart attack. Yup. -And forget I asked. -Yeah. Yeah. Hey, now, line up. Keep it down, Paddy! What do you think of this school? It's full of assholes. Why did you leave your last school? Being on the Mitch. And I told a teacher to fuck off. She was just out of hospital or something. And she started crying, like it was my fault. Wanker! Give it a whirl now, give it a whirl now. Jesus, Paddy. Every time. Don't tell me. -Stop. -Okay. I'm there now. A little low. What are you doing? -Do you want to see a good aim? -No! Ahh! Fuckin' hell! -Split up! -What? Split up! Whoa! The scholar! -How was it? -Bit of a doss for a change. Mmm-hmm? -You okay? -Yeah. I'm fine. Yeah, now, er... This weekend, I was thinking that maybe we could go and visit the grave, yeah, Dad? Yeah. We'll go up, Joe, yeah? Yes, whatever. Okay, er, Sunday afternoon? Sunday afternoon. You got any money on you, son? Like how much? Like say 12, 15... What's it for? Ah, it's for... It's for Simon McCurdie, isn't it? I'm only a bit fuckin' short here. Come on. You're 12 quid short there? Ah, no. I like to give him 50 at a time. -How long are you gonna be paying it off? -Three months. Three months'll see me finished. It's been fuckin' years, but. How much is it? -What? -Overall. What are we looking at? Around two grand? Two... two and a half... call it three. What's wrong with the bank? Ah, the bank! "Ah, the bank!" What? "The bank!" We want to get you down the bank get you a loan, clear this off with Simple Simon. Well, I tell you. -You're not gonna be crippled with this fuckin' shit. -Stop it! You're giving me a fuckin' headache, all right? You might as well give him the keys. He seems to own everything else in the town, you know? -What are you like? -I don't know. Fuckin' say it to him. We're out of season. It's a killer. Ask him. Give us a break, just till summer kicks in. -It's fuckin' shit now. -Yeah. -Will you say it to him? -I said yeah, I said yeah, I said yeah! Go on out of that, you bollocks. I'm coming down with you. What... Fuck! I'm going to! Get your coat. No. -Get your coat. -No. Orla! I'm not going to the pictures with you. Ah. Is he in? He's in the back. Do you want to come round? Thanks a million. Hello, Charlie. -Guys, what can I do for you? -Oh. Just to... -Oh, good man, good man. -What's here? Should be 50. Oi. Well, sure, grand, sure. I trust you. George, at this stage. Now, what are we today, darling? The 4th. Er... Um... Could you give us some idea how we stand, Simon, at the moment? I could, of course, yeah. I could. Is everything all right? Yeah, just to know where we are. Well, you're right. See, I don't... ...and you're paid me as of now, uh, in the last two years, let's see where are we. Uh, Frank, would you ever do the honours with the tea there? Thanks, Orla. And then now, what did we say? That'll be 44 payments of £50. No, 45 now. I just... That's the one you gave me now. I'm just writing that here now. Yeah, yeah. So that'll be 45, er... Oh, Jesus! Have you no... Is there no milk? Right, so that'll come to now... £1,190, uh, outstanding. -All right? -Mmm. -Okay? -Uh... I'm... If we could... If we could, uh, wait until things are back in season, you know, I mean... You know yourself, I'm I'm relying on a few of me regulars, so, you know, kinda ticking over till the summer end... You want to make a break with the payments? Yeah. George, are you stuck? Well, not stuck. A little impeded. Oh, yeah. Right. Okay, okay. Right. Now, tell us, do you, do you keep any, any any old bloody accounts down in the chipper there? -Well, basic, you know. -Yeah, yeah, I know, yeah. Well, look, I'll tell you what, let me have a look and I'll see what I can do. Maybe to speed it up, I could go in, float in a little bit of money, maybe a grand, or... Fuck it, what's outstanding here, maybe. Hmm? That could be my share. You know, we could be partners for six months or whatever and I'll take what you owe at source as partners. Partners? -In the chipper? -Well, then I'll back out, like, I'll be gone, you know? And we're even. What do you think of that? If you'd just given me that £12... ...but you couldn't do that, could you? You had to make a thing of it. Now look. I am not the clown who borrowed the money from him in the first place. Hmm? Before we go, please, please, don't forget that the world-famous eminent philosopher Professor Wolfgang Konigsburg is visiting our college for three days from Wednesday to expound his theory that language is dying. Now this is a rare opportunity for you to see an historical figure in philosophy while he's still alive, for the moment, at least. People. Next time. Look, er, Deborah, I've been thinking about this, you know, and... I can't, you know, I'm with someone. Oh? All right. And I can't hurt them. -Maybe you should've said something. -Yeah, I know, I know, but, I mean, regardless, you know, it's a professional fuckin' thing. -I could lose my job over it. -Yeah, I know, but it's like... I don't want this to become a thing where I feel like "Oh, okay," and you gave me a line and I went for it. Well, I, I don't think I did. Well, okay, I might have said some stuff, you know, but I mean, that's because I just get too too intense about this fuckin' shit. Yeah, I know, but -now you're saying it's nothing. -No, Jesus, no! I mean, what... What I just said. You know, I mean, I haven't felt like this, like, since I was a teenager. -Well, you are a teenager. -Ray, I'm 21. Right, okay, right, you're 21. -Oh, don't be so sarcastic. -I'm not being sarcastic, you know? I'm not! I'm sorry. I feel awful. So, that's it, then? I don't know! Look, do you want me to just go? Well, I mean, I know, I know you should go. Yeah, but do you want me to? Do you fancy a pint? I'm off the drink, you know. Technically. Well, maybe. Maybe just one. Fine. She was the most beautiful girl, you know? Well, Jesus, yeah. She was something in this town, something to behold. It'd break your fuckin' heart! -Youse never spoke to her? Hmm? -No! You wouldn't. It's not for us or you, it's not for you. Bollocks! You weren't even there! Jesus Christ, to look at her now, though. Big fat lump she is. I tell you, you'd nearly shit yourself now -she's that fuckin' ugly! -It'd break your heart. -Aye-aye, look who's escaped. -Oh, no, Jesus. How's it going, son? What'll you have? No, lads. I'll look after meself. -Eh, no, we'll get you... -No, I'll look after meself. A pint of cider, please, Teddy... Tim. -How are you doing? -Doing good, yeah. -Yeah? On the right track, yeah? -Oh, yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah, yeah. Look, don't fuck me up here boys, okay? -There you go, John. -Aye. Anybody, I think, can be led astray. That's what I said. He was always a good boy in here -where it counts. -Okay. I'm gonna sort of skull this, and then I need to fly into the night so... Ah, yeah. Then, enjoy that, the pint, your drink and the atmosphere, and your liberty. -And cheers. -Cheers. CHEERS. Ladies. There goes one of the biggest fuckin' head-bangers this town ever produced. Sure, all the Traynors were mental. Yo, John. Oh, Frank, man, yeah. -You all right there, eh? -Yeah. Wrecked, you know. I just got out Monday. Just all the same... I'm having a pint in every pub in town. -It's 14 pints, you know. -Jesus. Yeah, that's good going, John. Yeah, it is. It is good going. When you stop to consider that all the pubs are full of smelly old bastards. Yeah. What's up? Watch the fuckin' bike, will you, man? What the fuck's it doing here? Yeah, yeah, everyone's judge and jury. Will that do you? ...no belief in the afterlife? No, no, none whatsoever. What are your views now? Ever since that experience, I feel closer to spirits, um, and to... - To God? - To God, yes. Hiya. Hi. Stupid. All these clothes still lying here. Yeah. Now, this is very simple. On Monday afternoon, Mr Fanning was hit on the head with a stone and Mr Gibney was also injured. He was lucky, he only sprained his wrist. But Mr Fanning was unconscious for about 30 seconds... Which is very serious! Now, the way I see it is this. Some boy here knows who did it, if only the boy himself. If he does not come forward or is brought forward, I'm going to give the whole school detention every Wednesday and Thursday, starting from today. Quiet! You see, boys... This is not simply a school matter... This is a matter for the guards. This is Sgt Duggan and she is very concerned to find out who did this so as he can be brought to book for what we consider a very serious incident. What are you gonna do? Well, I'm not gonna do fuckin' detention! -The whole school is gonna be in it! -I know. I'm going on the Mitch after lunch, and you should as well. -Why? -There's no point you being in detention for something I did? I'm an expert forger. I'll give you a brilliant note. What? -You gonna rat me? -No. Well, then, you're in. Is that your boat? Yeah. It doesn't go. Hey, Mum? -She's not here. -Where's your dad? Uh, he lives in England. -Do you want some toast? -Yeah, lovely. Okay. Nobody move! Jesus! Okay. Okay, this is a robbery. This is a robbery! Get your hands on your head! This is a fuckin' robbery! Come on! Come on! Come on! Okay, get your hands on your head! Get your hands on your head! Come on. Your face on the floor, come on! Hey, you! Nobody fuckin' move! This is a fuckin' robbery! Come on, yeah! Fuck you, come on! Come on, you beat... Come on, let's go, let's go, down on the floor. Frank, you all right? Hold on! Don't come in! - What are you doing? - Yeah, uh... I'm just moving the bed around, okay. Just moving the bed around. Moving the bed? Why? Yeah, just moving the bed. Come in. -You all right? -Yeah. -You're home early, you. -No. -Who were you talking to? -No, it was the radio. What radio? So you're having a bit of a play, are you? In your room? - You know yourself... - Right. -See you later. -Okay. Thanks again, CARMEL. Are you all right? Yeah. I don't treat you very well. What are you talking about? I know I don't... You know, the way that I think about you. And... What way do you think about me? It's like... you know, when I'm in my car, you know, it's like, it's like, I'm in a machine. And it brings me from this world into a different world. And when I'm in that world... I just don't think about you. -Are you trying to confess something me, Ray? -No! No... I just, er... I just gotta stop thinking. What are you like? I don't know. Fuck off! -Don't fucking stand there. -Get back, get back. Come up here again and you're fuckin' dead! Get in the queue! Fuck you! Show's over! Get inside... Get in. Get your money, bitch! It's good once you get in. Move. -How much is it? -Six quid. -Six? -What am I after saying? Six! -Move over there! Move. -Put your coat in over there! -Can I not hang on to it now? -No! You've to put it in. It's £1! What's your name? Joe. Joe Beneventi. Someone's after taking me bag. What? Someone's after taking me bag. Did you tell the bouncer? You have to wait till the end. You wanna ask at the cloakroom, see if someone left it in. Will you ask? Well, are you coming? Come on! Move it! Don't block the door. Come on. Say, has someone handed in a small black handbag? -It's not a fuckin' handbag! -What? Move in or get out! She's lost her bag. Now, you'll get it at the end of the night. Look, I'm not get any more fuckin' bags, Tony! Right? -I'm going on me break. -I know, will you move in? -She's lost her stuff, man! -There's nothing I can do about it. She's wrecked. -And what have you had to drink, love? -Fuck off! -Right, that's it! -What? Get them out. Get your fuckin' hands off me! Get out! Get yous a fuckin' act together!

Listen, you go on. I can get her back from here. Ah, I'll hang on with you. Here, but where are you going? I gotta have a piss.

Did you know that Dad owes money to Simple Simon? What money? He owes him some money, okay? How much? How much is it? I don't know. Got to be 30 grand. -What? -At least. 30 grand, I mean, okay? You know, Dad owed him three. I'm being straight with you, Joe, okay? This is a joke. This is your money, Ray, right? I wish it was a joke, Joe, you know? -I'm after doing the getaway! -Youse both did it? No! It was fuckin' genius brains here! -Jesus Christ, I am... -I got to get out of here! -Jesus, Frank! -I'm sorry, Joe! I'm afraid no one's going anywhere at this point of time. All right? You are going to be okay. -All right? -My fuckin' head! What are we going to do? You see, at last, somebody is finally asking a sensible question! Now, I should know, I have that sort of philosophical training. What are we going to do? Everything all right? Yeah. Youse both look like you've seen a ghost. We saw a dog being knocked down. A dog? You'd think it was a child the way you're sitting there. Yeah, he's just a bit, you know... What's wrong with your leg? Oh, I was trying to help the dog, the fuckin' thing bit me, you know. Fuckin'... -Get it seen to, boy! -I will, I will, yeah, yeah. I'll go down after tea. You're an awful loolah! Hello. -Sergeant. Snack box? -No, no. Sit down. I'm not hungry. I'm just noseying around. Okay. Do you know anything about the robbery? -At the bookie's? -Mmm. Do I know what about it? Just thought you might have heard about it. Just the same as anyone. Some nutcase robbed the place. Yeah. You know this young buck, don't you? Yeah. John Traynor. You seen him since he left prison? Yeah. I had a pint with him. He's broken his parole, did you know that? No, I didn't know that. Did he say anything to you about leaving? I think that he might have said something about Chicago. -Um, yeah. -Chicago? Yeah. As I said, I don't really remember. Did he say anything about the bookie's? No. You didn't talk about it? No. I want you to have a little think about it, hmm? And give me a ring if you remember anything, will you do that? Sure, yeah. Okay. I'll leave you to your paper. Yeah, it's not mine. Somebody left it behind. Finders keepers, huh? -Raymond. -Frank! -Talk to me. -How's it going? Fuckin' nerve-wracking, man! -How's Joe? -Joe's okay. -He's good, yeah. -Yeah? Yeah, but, er... I sort of don't know what I'm doing, you know. You know? I can't... Frank? I want to get away. I mean, I got to get out of here. I mean, just a couple of days. Okay, look... I'll tell you what, we'll go away for the weekend. -Yeah. Good. -Okay. Bring Joe. -Nice hotel, pool, yeah? -Yeah, good. Okay. -Okay. And, Frank... -Yeah. -This is on you! -Of course, this is on me. Yeah. Fuckin' right, of course it is. You fuckin' moron! -Ray. -Hey, Tony. Look here, the thing is we went to meet him at the airport, he's really a nice enough fella. I said it to him about the questions... And lo and behold, he just goes, "Yeah." -After all that? -Yeah. It's not a session. Just one or two questions. I put it down that you... That you'll ask one. Oh! That's, that's, that's great! That's brilliant. This is what it's all about, you know. Yeah, fair enough. -And at 11.00 in the morning. -Yeah. Okay. -Don't drink too much. -Oh, yeah. Just get past... Thank you! How are you? That's it. Don't mind me. A little drink in moderation never hurt anyone. Why the hell do you always look at me as if I have just gingerly slipped a wasp up your crack? Because I know what you're like, maybe. And I know it's a terrible thing, you know. You've gone through your whole life, and no-one'll touch you with a ten-foot pole, but it's nobody's fault. You know, it is not the fault of mankind. It's just... Just let it go. Tell me about you and Deborah McEvor. Oh, that caught your attention. What are you playing at? You have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, really? Then, why has one of her classmates reported you? Sort it out, Ray. Don't make me tell Tony. Trish. Deborah. I am in trouble with my boss and so are you. -It is an extremely bad situation. -What? I'm in trouble? The only way that I am going to be able to keep my job is if you get booted out of college. -What? -Or, or... -We stop seeing each other. -Jesus Christ! So... What d'you want to do? Ray, I can't believe they'd boot me out. Absolutely they'd boot you out. You wouldn't, their arse! Believe what you like. You wouldn't be the first. We have to stop seeing each other. -Forthwith. As of. -Okay. Okay. Jesus Christ! Deborah, I think you're lovely. You don't have to return the compliment. Sorry. I'm just fuckin' reeling here. I'm in shock. Ah. Well... That's it. -Shit, eh? -Okay. Jesus! Ray! Can I have a hug? Ray, we can't. Can I come back to your house? I really don't think that it's a very good idea. Deborah, Deborah. Deborah. What? I'm really... I'm really, kind of interested in you keeping the boots on. Okay. What are youse doing? Just getting a suitcase. What time youse going? Ray's picking us up at lunchtime. How much are you taking? I don't know. I want to do this properly. I'm taking five grand! Thanks, George. How are youse? Aye. It's shocking... Shocking what happened. It's a dreadful fuckin' world, Frank. Put years into a community... You turn round, they fuck you in the arse. -Do you think they'll catch who did it? -Are you codding me? The guards in this town couldn't catch the clap off a ten-spot whore. The fucking killer is, I nearly had the bastard, Frank. Yeah? As close to me as you are now! Vanished into thin air. Luckiest bastard I ever saw. Bastard? Now, one, two, three, four pretty little ladies, what do we want? When I say language is dying, one of the most common criticisms is that I could not communicate such a fact if it were. Further, I do consider, when I say language is dying, I'm being partially mischievous, but it has been said before, Socrates was concerned by the Sophists' mastery of rhetoric for precisely that reason. The more communication becomes an effective tool in getting us what we want, the more selective we become with information and the less we can really know. That is all I mean. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Professor Konigsberg. Now, Professor Konigsberg has kindly agreed to take one or two questions, and I know that Dr Raymond Sullivan would like to ask the first one. Oh! Oh, my God! Thank you. Professor Regan. I, er, would like to ask Professor Konigsberg if, during his, his long and eminent career, he has, he's ever seen anything, expressed quite like that? Please? Thank you. You certainly cleared up a lot for me. Excuse me. Are there any further questions? Giuseppe! Hey, hey, hey, hey. -No... -Listen, would you buy a round and don't be messing? Hey, steady on. Steady on. You're only away for a night. I seem to be in awe Of everything you are I guess to you I look Like a fool I bled from eye to ear My conscience isn't clear I guess I've hit upon For a bait To take you round the world Yeah Ever as you... ♪ Hi. What do girls want when they're with a fella? That's a hard question, you know. That's like saying what do people want? Nobody knows. What if say, a girl was like asleep or something and you decided you were going, you know, do what you wanted while she was asleep or something? Or mad drunk or something? If she didn't know, she wouldn't want to, would she? What do you mean? You know... I think the thing about things like that is you know, just don't be a bollocks, isn't it? Sometimes, you know, you just can't fuckin' see past yourself and you go on and you be a bollocks anyway and you know that you are. And then that might get you annoyed and you just keep going... I'll tell you this much, though. I wish I had respected women more in my life. 'Cause there is nothing worth ending up on your own for, Joe... No, nothing. You're not in trouble, are you, Joe? No... No. Okay. Ta-da! I feel like celebrating! -Champagne! -Ever had champagne? -No. -I haven't either, Ray. All right. Here we go. Get that down you... Steady! -Now, good luck! Cheers! -Cheers! Isn't that the most gorgeous fuckin' taste? It's very bitter, isn't it? That's disgusting! What? You're not trying. It's champagne. I just don't like the taste of it. That's all. Now, I'm being nice here, Frank. I'm not gonna tell you how much this cost! Well, I didn't ask you to buy it, mate, you know! I'll drink it. I'm gonna drink it, Frank. I'm gonna drink it all. -Good, do. I know. -I am. -I will. -I know, good. -Yeah. Right. -All right. What are you looking at? -Nothing. -You are so! See, that is what you need. But you don't think you have a chance there now, do you? What do you think? I think she would go for you big time. Hold on. Thank you, Frank. What are you doing? What's he doing? Well... I think he's talking to the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life. Relax. -What's he doing? Fuck! -They're coming over. Gentlemen, this is Michelle. Michelle, this is Frank and this is Joe who I was telling you about. -Hi. -Hi. -Would you like to dance? -Yeah. -How did you say to her? -What? -How did you do that? Come on! -A-ha! -Trade secret. -You paid her? Give me some credit! Okay, Ray, I'm begging you, I'm begging you to tell me what you did. I told her he's got six months to live. Is she not scared it's catching what he has? No. She's not stupid, Frank. You can't catch leukaemia. Is there a problem, guard? I'm gonna ask you to come in. Is someone gonna tell me, please what this is about? I'd just like to have a word with Joe, Frank. -Okay? -Joe? What's wrong? Just want to ask him a few questions. About what? -Ask me. -It's got nothing to do with you, Frank. CARMEL, can you get everyone a cup of coffee or something? - Yeah. Sure. - Thanks. Joe. Mr Beneventi. Someone tell me what the fuck is going on! -Get out! Get out! -I'll tell you later! Selfish! Would you like to sit down? Okay... Now, the first thing I'm going to ask is if you know a girl called Tara Komisky. -No. -No? You were seen with her at Shadows Nightclub on Wednesday evening. Oh, yeah. Do you go to Shadows Nightclub? I've been there once, yeah. -Last Wednesday? -Yeah. Do you remember the girl? Yeah. I didn't know that was her second name. Okay. Now, I'm here because you've been accused of raping Tara Komisky. What? Do you understand what that means? But I didn't. Now you see, she hasn't accused you. A boy called Damien Fitzgibbon has. She was attacked in the graveyard up near the Grange. Now, she's identified Damien as her attacker, but he says it was you. But I didn't do it. You have to ask her. She remembers somebody else being there. I didn't know she was getting raped. I thought she was asleep or something. I didn't know. I just saw them for a second... Okay. So you were there? You understand we need to take a blood test from you? Is that okay? Yeah. Good man. Do you know how I know he didn't do it? Because he's like us. We're thinkers, not doers. -He's not capable of it! -Right. You're right. Now... -All done. Mmm. -Is everything cool? I think you're a bit tired now. Thanks very much. Could I have a quick word with you for a second? See you back at the house, okay? Yeah, yeah. See you later. You didn't hear anything else about what we were talking about, did ya? When we were talking about the bookie's. No. -Nothing. -Yeah? What did I just say? Don't take that tone with me. I'm just asking you. Why are you asking me? You gonna humiliate all of us today, is that it? I'm not trying to humiliate anyone, Frank. I'm just trying to find out who did it. Fine, I know. Good luck. Good luck to you! -I don't need luck. -You wanna bet? -I don't gamble. -You're right not to. The bookies have it all sewn up. Oh, Frank! -All right? -Yeah. -Ready for the lather? -Yeah. Are you all right? Yeah. Mad! Do you know your mother was partially deaf in one ear? No. When she died, they found... The doctors found a little tooth in her ear. -A tooth? -A little baby tooth. They thought, you know, your mother, must have when she was young girl, the tooth must've fell out. When she put it under her pillow, it must've gone in her ear. That's what they thought must have happened. What do you think of that? Do you have it? I think I'm after losing the fuckin' thing. For fuck's sake! Would you believe that? -Dad? -Mmm? Were you always a bit mad? A bit... Always. You'll go mad too. Sleep tight. See you soon, yeah? Yeah! All right. Come out? Yeah. Okay. Raymond... Keep your nose clean. You know me. I'll see you soon, Dad. -Look after yourself. -Yeah. Listen, I'm gonna send a few bob back, you know. Clear up this loan. I know. You look after yourself. I'll manage. Why don't you just let me do this? What are you like? I'm like meself, that's what I'm like. That's your fuckin' problem. Fuck off! Fuck off! Giuseppe! Come on, Giusep... Say goodbye mate, come on, come on! Come on. Here. Mind who you take up with. There's a bag under the press.
