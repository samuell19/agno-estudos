The bastard. He's gonna get his end away. She's fit, as well. What's that wanker got that I haven't? You mean besides his hand on her tits? D'you think he brought a condom? Probably the last thing on his mind, Rob. Best help him out then, eh? You ready? Get them! ? Oh, won't you tell me what I do with my days? ? Oh, won't you tell me what I do with my days? ? Tell me ? Oh, tell me ? Oh, tell me, oh, tell me, yeah ? Oh, won't you tell me how to sign on the line? ? Oh, won't you tell me how to sign on the line? ? Tell me ? Oh, tell me ? Oh, tell me, oh, tell me, yeah If I don't get sex, nobody gets sex. Next year, Zig, we'll be 16. Let's go somewhere decent. We can go on an 18-30 holiday. We're bound to get a shag there. 18-30 holiday? Where am I gonna get the money for an 18-30 holiday? I can't even afford a new pair of trainies. You're all self, self, self. What about what I want? - We all know what you want. - I want a drink in the club. You mean let's go and see Sophie. Sophie, the girl of my dreams. - Yeah, your wet dreams. - Oh, Rob! Hey, gorgeous. Want a wig? I'll be back in two minutes. Hear that? She called me gorgeous. She calls everyone that, even your dad. You don't think she fancies... Alright, lads? - What happened to the beach party? - It was boring. - What? - It was boring. Boring! I don't know what's wrong with you young people. We never had boring. Anyway... Hey, love! Two Cokes, love! Dad, buy us a beer. What, and have your mam like that all night? No. It's our last night. One little beer's not gonna hurt. It's not gonna hurt because it's not gonna happen. Thanks, lovely. Now do you want these Cokes or not? Yes, please, Mr Wallace. OK. Well, if you need anything, we're over there, alright? Enjoy yourselves. - Why does he do that? - Don't fucking ask me. Soph, stick something in these fucking Cokes before I kill myself. - You got any lD, lads? - What? I'll meet you round the back in five minutes, yeah? Are they alright? They're just having a Coke. - Are they coming back? - Yeah. She's gorgeous, and she's funny and... She's probably shagging a big lad with a car and a job. - Shut up. I can pass for 18. Sort of. - You can't even buy a drink at the bar. I look older than you, baldy bollocks. You two, guess what I have behind my back. Ta-dah! Oh, Sophie, you're a star. Cheers, mate. I can't believe we have to go tomorrow. I wish we had more time. Why? What d'you think you're gonna miss? You. Oh! That's so sweet. No, look, just... Not right now, yeah? Just... But, Soph, it's my last night. Maybe I could visit you at uni. You could show me the big city. Yeah, yeah. Maybe. Look, I've got to go. But I'll be finished by one if you want to meet me by my caravan. Yeah, OK, that would be great. Look, I've got to go. See you later. Fucking hell, have we got any of them condoms left or what, lad? Ta. We're Dead Cowboys. Fuck off quietly. She wants to meet you. Doesn't mean you're getting a shag. I'm telling you, it's a dead cert. We've been meeting all week. She says I'm very mature and everything. - Hmm! - I'm serious, lad. We talk about stuff, you know, like why we're here and all that. We're here because your mum and dad take us here every fucking year. Not here, you twat. Here. Rob, I never knew you were so deep. I think I fancy you now. Piss off, Ziggy. Look, lad, she thought you was a nice kid. Alright to have a chat with and that, maybe a little kiss, but that's it. Fuck off, Ziggy. You dirty twat! Fucking hell, I don't know what came over me. I do. You're a fucking lightweight. No, I was fine and then it just fucking hit us like a brick. Alright. Come on. Turn it off before your dad sees us. Get the door handle. - Don't! - Shh! I don't need to ask if you two have been drinking, do I? You're a disgrace, the pair of you. We'll talk about this tomorrow. Now, you, get to bed before your mother sees you. Right. Nice. Did you give him anything to drink? Hiya, Soph. What are you doing here? Where's Robbie? He's being sick all over the place. He's not coming. - I shouldn't have given you that vodka. - Well, he says he's sorry. This is his email in case you want to keep in touch. Oh. Thanks, Zig. So, erm, what are you gonna do now? I dunno. Just hang out here, I guess. You don't have to. I mean, be alone. Erm, I'm feeling OK. We could always... It's alright, Zig. I think you'd best go home. Listen, just tell Robbie... I don't know, just not to drink as much next time. It's bad for his aura. - See you later, Zig. - See you. How are you feeling? I feel like shite. That vodka must have been off. Vodka doesn't go off. Besides, there's nothing wrong with me. Ziggy, leave him. The best way for him to learn is to suffer. - Alright? - Yeah. She's nice, her. Yeah, she is nice. Dad, I really don't feel right. Robbie, not again. - Did you put the toilet roll in here? - No. I was dealing with other things. Quick as you can, Robert. I did say put some toilet roll in here. I knew. - I was doing something else. - Yeah, like what? - Mr Wallace, it's Robbie. - More drama. - Oh, Jesus! - Rob! Rob, look at me. Wake up. What's happened? - Rob. - Wake up! - Robbie? - Robert? Robert? Robert? Get on the phone. Get an ambulance. Quickly. Ziggy, come on. Is Rob gonna be alright? Can I go and see him? It's not serious, is it? Where are we going? For Christ's sake, Ziggy, shut up! When I know something, you'll know something. Alright? Until then, stop talking about it. Please! I'm taking you home. Sorry for shouting, Ziggy son, but you can't see him. We don't know what's wrong with him, but they're gonna do some more tests so we'll know more. Can I see him later on? They're gonna transfer him up to Liverpool. I'm sure you'll be able to see him tomorrow. Thanks for the holiday. I really appreciate it. Hey! - You're a bit late. Everything alright? - Not really. - What's the matter? - I'm starving. - Is there anything to eat? - Sure. C'mon. And yes, I missed you, too. There you go. I'm sure he'll be fine, Ziggy. So did you... did you have a good time before all that? Well? Come on, what did you do? What did you see? Like blood from a stone. Can I help you, son? Yeah. I'm looking for Robbie Wallace but I think I'm in the wrong ward. - Are you family? - No, I'm his mate. Ziggy. - What? Like in Stardust. - No. As in Marley, alright? Shame. I prefer Bowie. He's in there. Thank you. - Bastard! - You look so sweet. It's the only gowns they've got. Delete that now, you knob. And turn it off. - I'm not allowed one. Neither are you. - Alright, alright. - Why are you in the kiddies' ward? - Cos I'm not 16 yet. Probably think I'll get molested by some old paedo. - Oh, yeah. I brought you some grapes. - Why? That's what you do when people are in hospital. Durr! They're a bit messy but.... So what's wrong with you? Every time I ask, they say they don't know yet. But how do you feel? Remember when we lost to Man Utd in the semifinals? - That bad? - Maybe not that bad. But close. Shit. And I thought you were faking. I'm sure this is where my mum used to bring all my old toys and stuff. Hey, kid, that's his fucking Action Man! You're evil, you. I wonder if I'll be getting a bed bath. l bet the nurses are dead fit. Oi! Try and remember that you're in a hospital. There's little kids out here and some of them are very sick. - Sorry. - Sorry. How are you feeling? A bit tired and my head hurts a bit, but I'm OK. I'll try and sort you out a proper gown. Then we can get these curtains open, can't we? - That'd be great. Thanks, Nurse. - And you can call me Tina. Typical, eh? I get the big old dykey nurse. - Robert Wallace? - Yes. - Alright, Robbie? - Would you mind waiting outside? - Yeah. Rob, I'll be off. - You've only just got here. Yeah, I know. But I'll see you tomorrow. Alright, mate. Thanks for the grapes. Right. Let's take a look at you, shall we? - Ziggy, son. - Alright? We'd... better get in to see him. Mam! A bit of privacy too much to ask for? Any more privacy and you'll go blind. Your uniform's in there so hang them up, yeah? If you're bored while Robbie's laid up, we could do something. Yeah, thanks, Mam. I'll let you know. OK. So how do you not know what you've got yet? - I'm telling you, it's in them notes. - What is? The fucking thing. Whatever's wrong with us. They were looking at the notes. I heard 'em saying it's definitely a something. Why don't you ask your mum? All she ever says is, ''Everything will be alright. You're gonna be fine.'' So what are you worried about? If everything was alright, they'd tell us what was wrong. Right? I suppose. So what now? You're gonna steal them notes. What, me? How? They'll notice straight away. - No. I've worked it out. - Whatever it is, I'm not doing it. - You've got to. - Why? - Because, you divvy, I can't, can I? - Well, I'm still not. - Are you gonna do it, then? - Yes. Yes, and how can I help you, Ziggy? It's Robbie, he feels sick, like he's gonna throw up. Do you feel that bad? Let's have a look. Where does it hurt? Here? - No, it's lower. - Here? Lower? - Bit lower - Lower? - Lower. - There? - Lower. - There? Lower? - Oh, really! - Nurse! Hang on. Mr Philips? Mrs Wallace. - Hiya, love. - Hiya, Mum. - How are you? - Alright. - Hiya, Mam. - Hey, Ziggy. What are you doing here? Not out and about enjoying your last day of freedom? I am. I've just come to check something on the internet. OK. - Mam? - Hm-hmm? Why do you think they haven't told Robbie what's wrong with him yet? I don't know. Haven't they? Maybe they don't even know yet. But if they did, why wouldn't they tell him? You're really worried about him, aren't you? - Not really. - Well, Robbie's a young lad. Maybe they think he'll get better quicker if he doesn't know. Stop him worrying. If it was me, would you tell me? Ziggy, I don't even want to think about that, thank you very much. He's going to be fine. OK. No! Hello, kids! - Come on, what did you find out? - Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Oh. What do you mean, nothing? I kind of ballsed it up. Fucking hell, you're useless. Are you serious? Yeah. I took the wrong thing. Sorry. - Did your mum and dad say anything? - They just looked miserable. But that's how they normally look. I've been thinking about the summer. What about Faliraki? - Fali-what? - Faliraki. It's in Corfu. It's where all the lasses go. It's wall to wall fanny. - Oh. - What do you reckon? Yeah, wherever. We'll be shagging morning, noon and night. Maybe. We'll see. There you go again, pissing on me chips. What's wrong now? - Nothing. - I'll go on my own. - It's not that, lad. - What is it then? Come on, it'll be great. We'll get jobs, like. Save up enough cash to do things in a bit of style. - Get the six-pack in shape. - Shut up, will you? - What? - Can we talk about something else? Why? What's the matter? Fuck off! What's the matter, Ziggy lad? Are you crying? For fuck's sake, Rob, you're dying! It was in your notes. Cardiomyopathy. It's your heart. That's why they're not telling you, cos you're dying. - You're lying. - I'm not, I swear. - You're a fucking liar. - I wouldn't do that. - You're a liar. Get out. - Why would I lie? You're my best mate. I don't know and I don't care. Just get out. Just go. Piss off! Ziggy? Ziggy? ? Have you ever held something ? Until your hands were aching ? And then let it go and watched it fall ? And listened to it breaking? ? I have held back time and tide ? When all the world was plenty ? And now my hands are open wide ? Open wide and empty ? For every breath that leaves me now Robert? Robert? Let's just leave him for a while. Come on, Rob. Come on, Rob, your dad's here as well. Come on. Robert? Let's just leave him. Leave him for a while. He can't stay underneath there forever. '''I've seen his topsails with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back, put back, sir, into Port of Spain.''' Do you know how much trouble you're in? What you did was totally irresponsible. You broke about a hundred privacy laws, not to mention putting my arse in the fire. What was I supposed to do? I know he put you up to it. I think he had the right to know. And for what it's worth, I think you did the right thing. But you went about it the wrong way. It didn't feel like the right thing. ? Have you ever held something ? Until your hands were aching ? And then let it go and watched it fall ? And listened to it... Robert, son, there's a lady here. Vanessa. She's from the Happy Moments Trust. And she helps children, you know, like you, do things or go places. Hi, Robert, or do your friends call you Robbie, like Robbie Williams? He's very popular, isn't he? Well, Robbie, boys like you are very... ..special. And what we try to do here is try and make your wishes come true. So if there's anything you've ever wanted, anything you have ever dreamed of, then we're here to help do it. For example, if you'd like to go to Disneyland, then we can try and arrange that for you. Would you like to go to Disneyland, Robbie? Hmm? Or maybe meet a pop star or a footballer? Someone from Liverpool or Everton perhaps? They're always very accommodating. Well, the Liverpool players always seem to want to talk to me, anyway. Those are just a few suggestions. Other people have their own ideas. Maybe you could tell me what you want. Hmm? Is there anything special you'd like to do, Robbie? I want a fuck. I'm sorry, I couldn't quite catch that. I want a fuck. Robert, we can't hear you. You'll have to come from underneath the bedclothes. There is something I want! I want a fuck! - Robert! - What? I don't want to die a virgin. I just want one shag before I go. Can you sort that out? How dare you speak to this nice lady like that? You apologise right away. There's always Sir Cliff Richard. He's very popular and always ready with a cheery song. But I hate Robbie Williams and couldn't give a fuck about... You both have a lot to talk about. Why don't I leave you both to it and you can let me know when you've decided? Shut up! - Evening. - Evening. Rob, I saw your performance. It was magic. The look on my mam's face. I know. ''I want a fuck!'' So, erm... - How do you feel about, you know...? - Dying? Go on, you can say it. - I don't want to talk about it. - OK. That's fine. - I mean it, though. - Don't worry, I won't mention it again. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about sex. I don't want to die a virgin. - You can't let me die a virgin. - What are you saying, Rob? I mean, we're best mates an' all and you're dying, but... there's limits, you know. No, you knob. Like your hairy arse would be my last wish. - Well, what then? - You've got to get a girl to shag me. - What? Me? - Yeah, you. - No way! - Yes, fucking way. How else am I gonna do it? Come on, Ziggy lad. If it was you in here, I'd do it. I wouldn't let you go without having a taste. But I'm not good at that sort of thing, you know I'm not. What am I gonna say? - You'll think of something. - I won't. I'll just look like a twat. So what's new? C'mon, Ziggy lad. Please, mate, for me. What about Karen Blackwell? She sucked off Toddy on the bus that time. She's minging. She'd crush us to death. But she'd probably do it for a pie. And she's got huge titties. Next. - Debbie? - Debbie Richards? Too insane. Did you see the state of Joss's face after she bit him? - Little Debbie. - Alright? If I wanted sex with an Oompa-Loompa, I'd send you to wherever the little orange fuckers come from. Next. Here we go. Cheryl Hanwell. Now she's hot. Like I want Cheryl to know I'm a virgin. She's got a mouth like the Mersey. - He's shagging his sister. - Oh, my God! I know. Dirty bastard! Might as well write it in six-foot letters across the yard. Have you tried Catherine Holmes yet? She's gorgeous. She'll never do it. Her dad's a vicar. - You alright, Zig? - You're rubbish at this. I'll tell you who's number one on my list. Lorna Patterson. Lorna? You're joking. She's a sixth-former. She's well out of your league. You know what they say: who dares wins. - You what? Cheeky little bastard! - It's the way you're asking. How's it my fault? I'm asking as nice as I can. Well, don't fuck it up by looking all creepy. Who's left to ask? - Just Kirsty. - Great. Kirsty. Kirsty. What the fuck do you want? Can I have a word, in private, like? Ooh! Sigmund! It's dead serious. It's important. Come on then, you little pervert. What do you think I am, a fucking whore? You freak! Hit him in the nuts! Lay into him, Little Debbie! What happened to you, then? I don't want to talk about it. Solving simultaneous equations using graphs is very easy. What I want you to do first of all is draw the line of the equation. The point where the lines cross is the solution. The equations can be linear which means they'll be straight lines. We're going to have a look at the examples. Kirsty, look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean any harm. Really. Yeah, well, I don't want no one thinking I'm a slag. But I've been having a think about it, and I'll do it. If you tell anyone, I'll tear your arms off. I know, don't worry. I'm only doing it because he's dying. Poor bastard. He is dying, isn't he? - Of course. Why would I make that up? - Yeah, well, he'd better be. I'm gonna be a social worker. So this is like training. Yeah, in a way. Hold on, you never said it was on a children's ward. How can we do it in front of all them kiddies? We'll just draw the curtain around the bed. I'll stand guard. No one will see. It's always dead noisy with the kids an' all anyway. - Alright. - Don't worry. No one will know. - Give me a minute to get him ready. - OK. - Who's that? - She's with Ziggy. Oh, is she? What's up, Zig? Lad, I've done it. She's come. Kirsty. Come? What for? For a shag, you moron, what do you think? Shit! She's here now? Fuck, I haven't had a bath or anything. - Hey, Robbie. - Hiya, Kirsty. - Sorry to hear about, you know... - Yeah. I'll draw the curtains and leave you to it. - No, wait. Hold on. - Come on, Robbie lad. I'm in a hurry. I'm baby-sitting tonight. Dazza's bringing some vodka round. - You got everything? - And be quiet. - What's going on? - Nothing. Then why are you out here and that curtain's drawn? - He's doing something. - What? Having a dump. No, he's not. No! I can't do it, Ziggy, I just can't. - What happened? - I don't want to do it. I just can't. Seeing him lying in that bed with the mask an' all. He's dying. I never knew anybody that died before. - I can't do it, not when he's dying! - Alright, keep your voice down. - I've got to go. I've got baby-sitting. - Thanks, anyway. Hang on a minute. I can give him a quick wank if you want. No, you're alright. Cheers, though. What the fuck was that supposed to be? - Didn't go too well? - No! Whose fault's that? - It's not mine. - Course it was your fault. I didn't know she'd bottle it. If I'd had time to prepare myself, I'd have had a chance. She said she was free. What was I meant to do? Check your fucking diary? You'll just have to find someone else now. - There isn't anyone else. - You don't understand. I'm dying. - I know. - I'm 15, for fuck's sake. 15! I don't want to fucking die. I don't want to fucking die, Ziggy! - Alright! - I don't want to fucking die, Ziggy! - I don't want to fucking die. - Nurse! - I'm not fucking dying! - Rob! Calm down! - Ziggy, sort him out! - Calm down! - I don't want to fucking die! - Nurse! Happy birthday. Come on, birthday boy, up you get. Hmm? ? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you ? Happy birthday, dear Sigmund Happy birthday to you - Mwah! - Mam, I told you not to call me that. Come on, it's your name. I gave that to you 16 years ago now. Happy birthday, sweetheart. Here. Go on. Go on. - Wow! Who gave you that? - Nanna. She can't afford 60 quid. Ah, well, she doesn't get to see you that often. - I'll put it towards some new trainies. - Hmm. Yeah. Here, open my present. Aye! You're gonna need that soon. Sooner than you think. You're a young man now. It's a good one. - Yeah, I can see that. Thanks, Mam. - Cool. Right, well, I'll leave you to open the rest of your cards. Don't be late for school, birthday or no birthday, OK? Nothing from my dad, then? No, just what's there. Happy birthday, Sigmund. Liverpool are better than Everton. We won the European Cup five times. - We won it twice. - Twice. That's it. D'you think my dad knows it's my birthday? I don't know, Ziggy. He's not here to ask, is he? Well, if he was here, then he'd obviously know, wouldn't he? Yeah, alright. Don't be smart. I don't know why you keep harping on about him. A leopard doesn't change its spots. He didn't care about us when he walked out, even after I moved all the way down here, and he doesn't care now. Look, tell you what, we'll have a wee birthday spliff when we get home. Sorry about yesterday, mate. It was my birthday. Happy birthday. Did you have a good day? It was alright. So you can shag legally now, but you can't buy a jazz mag. Congratulations. Rob, if you want me to buy you a magazine, just say. Like I get enough privacy for a decent wank with all them kids around. No, you're alright, mate. I'll save it all up for the lucky lass. - You haven't given up then? - Fuck, no. - Fuck, no! - What? My porn! My mam's gonna find all my porn on my computer. And my DVDs. She'll kill us! Fuck, she'll think I'm a right little perv. I said you could take him out for fresh air, not a crafty fag. The way I feel, you're lucky I'm not sucking on a crack pipe. Alright, back inside. You've got to get rid of that porn. - Hello, Ziggy. - Mrs Wallace. What is it? Robbie told me to check his emails and that. But I need to use his computer to do it. You'd better come in then. Here we are on ''Women's Health''. We're talking about the menopause... Oh, that's wrong. ..very much part of the pleasure of life and some believe your spirituality... ..began to question women about what they really thought... You dirty bastard! So why is the vagina still taboo? Oh, that's not right! But that is. Many thanks for coming into the studio. Jesus! I've brought you a cup of tea. And a slice of cake. It's Battenburg. Robbie's favourite. Yeah, mine as well. I'll be off then. - Oh. See you. - Thanks for the cake. What a poxy day I've had. - Never mind that. Did you get it done? - No bother. Now look at this. ''Dogging disgrace at local beauty spot.'' Not that, you dick, the ads. ''Discreet massage in enjoyable surroundings.'' ''Liverpool's finest salon, staffed by the most beautiful girls.'' - You're not serious? - Course I am. Look where it is. Ten minutes away. We'll be back before they know we've gone. We haven't got that kind of money. How much is it? - What did you get for your birthday? - 60 notes. No. No fucking way. That's for my new trainies. These ones are shagged. - You can have mine when I'm dead. - Rob! I was only saying. Alright, I'll bring the money in. Right, are we ready? Look, somebody's bound to have seen us. Nobody knows who we are. The hospital's massive. Let's go. - But they'll miss you. - For fuck's sake, stop worrying. We'll be back before they know we've gone. Nobody will know any different. Come on, let's go then! Are they bouncers? I thought about being a bouncer once. Yeah. And a fireman and a footballer and a skateboarder. What d'you want to be now? I just want to be older. OK, this is it. This is it. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? - Taking you in, what d'you think? Bollocks. I'm not getting wheeled into there like a cripple. Get me out of this chair and I'll walk. Money. Good luck, mate. Enjoy it. Alright, love? Shit! Immigration! Get off! Get off me! Get off! Shit! - Get off me! - Calm down! I've done nothing! Where is he? His mate's just taken him for a constitutional. Why don't you nip down to the canteen, grab a coffee and wait for him? Shouldn't he have his oxygen? No, he'll be fine, so long as he doesn't exert himself. - What's happening? - The police came. - Fuck, that'll do. A trolley. - No fucking way. - Hey! - Get off me! - Where's your clothes? - I don't know. Get out of here! Put that around you. So go on, tell us what happened. Nothing. Fucking nothing. She was gorgeous, an' all. Big tits and everything. - Why didn't they come 20 minutes later? - Did you give her the money? - Yeah, when I went in. - So all my money's gone? - And my clothes and my trainers. - My fucking trainies! Fucking hell, just get us back before the dykey nurse finds out. Fuck's sake! Fucking hell, Robbie! - Fucking hell, Ziggy! - You're heavy. Fucking hell. You have to lose some weight. Lose weight? Fucking hell, I'm dying. That's the last thing I want to do. - You fatty. - You think I give a shit? Busy, was it? The canteen? - Not especially, no. - Good. Cos I'm on my break soon. I don't suppose you noticed what the specials were? - No, we didn't. - They make a great shepherd's pie. Keith Richards likes shepherd's pie. Great aficionado. Remember him from the Rolling Stones? Nurse, if you don't mind, I really need to see my son. Hello, love. How are you? Hey? So-so. Alright. You've pulled your drip out again. - I'll get off, leave you to it. - Alright, mate. - Right. I'll just get a fresh needle. - Thanks, Nurse. How are you doing? Oi! Stop right there! Where the hell have you been? - Just out for a bit of fresh air. - Out where? - Out and about. Not far. - Are you mad? Do you have any idea what could have happened? Do you know how irresponsible it is to take Robbie off the ward? Why do you think he's in here, eh? - This isn't a game. He's very sick. - I know, but it was important. lmportant enough to put his life at risk? Yeah. Well, it better had have been. Mum, it's knock and wait, not knock and walk in. Why? What could I possibly see that I haven't seen before? I thought you were getting new trainers. I am. I'm getting a last wear out of these. That's not like you. Anyway, come on. Tea, biccies and bed. Don't panic. He's only in cardiology. Can you read me a story please? My eyes hurt. What, me? What do you want me to read? Redwall. Isn't that about all the animals that can talk and fight and that? You can start now. What's the matter? Can't you read? - Is that a library book? - What does it look like? Look inside the cover. What does it say, Mam? - Where did you get this? - What does it say, Mam? I'll tell you, shall I? ''To Ziggy, Happy 10th Birthday, Lots of love, Dad.'' The same birthdate as mine. What a coincidence that is! A lad with the same name and birthday gets a present from his dad. Can't be me, can it, Mam? It can't be my dad sending me presents because he walked out on us, didn't he? Never so much as sent a card, never wanted to see us. Can't be him, can it? Alright, alright. It's from your dad, OK? Now can we talk about this at home? - No. Where does he live? - What? Where does my dad live? - I don't know. - Liar. - Sigmund, please. - Where? I don't know. New Brighton in the Wirral, I think. But I don't know, he moves around a lot. Ziggy, I can explain. This is not what it seems like. Whatever I've done, he's still the arsehole who walked out on us. Yeah, and you're still a fucking liar! Zig, where did you get to? What's up with you? I just found out my mum's been lying about my dad. They all lie, Ziggy. All of them. Turns out he lives on the Wirral. That's not so bad. You going to see him, then? Dunno. Maybe. I've been thinking about getting laid and I've thought of another plan. For fuck's sake! Can we not talk about your cock just once? I was gonna tell you my new plan. No! I'm sick of you telling us what to do. I don't have to do fuck all! I'm sick of running around trying to get you laid. - Trying and fucking it up. - Right. Whatever I do goes wrong. Why not try getting it right for a change? - I've got my own shit to worry about. - I am the one dying here. And don't we all know it? - What's that supposed to mean? - You know fine well. I thought we were mates. So did I. Don't stay on my account. Piss off. - Fuck you. - Yeah, well, fuck you too! Hello, can I help? You don't know a bloke called Geoff Cavanagh, do you? Geoff Cavanagh? It's at the bottom of this road and it's on the right-hand side. If memory serves, he lives in number 13. OK? Geoff Cavanagh? Gerry Cavanagh, that's me. I don't know any Geoff. Sorry. I've got the wrong house. Take care, now, alright? Where have you been? I've been worried sick. I stayed at my mate's. Ziggy, I'm really sorry. Mam, can we not talk about that right now? - Are you sure? We should talk. - Yeah, just not now. Guess what. I found some photographs. You and Robbie. I thought they might help. Cheer him up. I've put them on your bedside table. Hmm? Rob. Rob. Robbie! Ziggy! What the fuck? - Ssh! I've just come to say I'm sorry. - What are you on about? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna get you a shag. No, Zig, it's alright. No. You were right. You're my best mate and you're going out with a bang. No, Zig. I'm serious. I'm sick of it. Sex isn't the be-all and end-all. Yeah, well, I've got to go, so I promise you I'll sort you out. Zig, it's alright. Ziggy? Shit! Mam, can I lend some money? - Well, how much, baby? - I dunno. About 60 quid. 60 quid? Well, what for? New trainies. What happened to the money you got from your... The money you got for your birthday? You were buying new trainers with that. I bought Robbie something to cheer him up. Ah, that was nice of you. And did it? Did it what? - Cheer him up? - Oh, no. Oh, OK. Then, well, yeah. Yeah, I'll lend you the money. Cheers, Mam. Alright, love? Kids half-price on a Wednesday, love. Nice trainies. Where are you going? Come back! Come here. Are you looking for something? I'm looking for a... you know, professional. Oh, aye? Sure. Anyone in particular, like? A fit one, like, young. It's for my friend. He's in hospital. Hospital? I think I might know the girl. You got money? How much is it? Depends. Usually it's, er, between, er, 50 and 100. I've got 60. What'll that get me? 60? I tell you what. Your mate's in ozzie, sick? I'll do a deal. 60 quid. He can do whatever the fuck he likes to her. How's about that? Money. Don't I pay you afterwards? No, how do I know you will? No, I'll get her and bring her back here. I don't want her now. I need time to arrange it. Listen, little man, if I wanted to, I could take the money off you now. But I can't. I'm an honest man. I tell you what, I'll give you my number. Have you got a pen? Have you got a pen? - I have. - Sound. Right. What I'll do is I'll go and get her. You wait here. I'll bring her back, you check her out, see if we're alright. We got a deal? What's your name, kid? - Barry. - Barry, yeah? Money? You wait here. In a bit, Barry. Listen, let me just explain to you. Loser! I should charge you anyway. Listen... Shit! Jesus! Jesus, why do I always get the weirdos? Picks me up, drives round the block and then changes his mind. Fucking waste of time! - Were you looking? - Not really. - What does that mean? - I'm expecting someone. A man. Oh, yeah? Is that what you're into? No, this bloke went off to get me a girl. How long ago was that, then? About 40-odd minutes ago. Let me guess. You paid in advance, right? Your first time, I take it? He gave us his number. Yeah, well, why don't you give him a ring? I'm sure he's on his way back now. Meantime, that's my number, love. If your man doesn't come back, just ring me direct. Did you see that knobhead? Good evening. - May I come in? - Yeah, sure. We picked him up on suspicion of soliciting. Prostitution. What? The lad says it was a misunderstanding. Oh, God! We're going to believe him this time, but you need speak to him. I will, I will. On the Dock Road, the red-light district. Oh, God! Ziggy! Ziggy, let me in. Come on. Ziggy, what is wrong? Come on. Ziggy, what's happening to you? Is it drugs? Ziggy, you can talk to me. Are you gay? Ziggy! Open this bloody door! The police will be the last of your fucking worries once I get my hands on you! The development of the lsle of Wight relies on tourism. However, there are problems with this industry as the ferries can be very expensive. The main industries are tourism, healthcare and engineering, but supplying those industries can be hard. Ziggy? Zig? God, if you're there, give me a hand... for Robbie. Thanks for nothing. - Get in, son. - Hey, Mr Wallace. I'll take you to school. - Thanks for the lift an' all. - Just wait a minute. Wait a minute. - The other night... - It wasn't what it seemed... You're right, it wasn't what it seemed. You see, son, this thing with Robert... I mean, it can affect the whole of your life. You understand what I mean? It's, like, it's very stressful. And these things, well, they can come between a man and a wife in all sorts of ways. So, you look for a bit of comfort. You think it'll release the pressure. And of course, it doesn't. So, anyway... What do you say that we just forget all about it? Not for my sake. For Robbie's sake. It's OK, Mr Wallace. The less said, the better, eh? Yeah, that's the spirit, son. The less said, the better. Oh, anyway... I suppose you could be doing with a bit of pocket money, couldn't you? You lads always need something. I could use a new pair of trainies. Oh, yeah? How much are they? 40? 50? 60 quid for a good pair. There. Well, take it. Just a thank you for being there for Robert. Right, yeah. Hey, Zig, is that right what everyone's saying about Robbie? Yeah, it is. See? I told you he was a fucking virgin. What a wanker. - What? - Can I have a word? What is it this time? In private. I won't be a minute, Bethan. I can't believe you'd have the brass balls to ask me that! I know how it sounds but look at it from his point of view. No, look at it from my point of view. - I can't do it without you, Tina. - Good! Apart from the fact that he's under 16 and therefore illegal, I am a nurse. My job is to care for people, not to help them get their rocks off. I know all that, but he's dying. Exactly. And this sort of thing would push him over the edge. How long has he got anyway? Do you want him to die happy or miserable? Well, do you? Well, it's not about that. It's about ethics and morals. What? Ethics and morals? So it doesn't matter if he dies happy or not? Who gives a fuck what he thinks? Doesn't matter what he thinks. He's a 15-year-old lad. He's been nowhere, he's done nothing. What does it matter, eh? And what do his parents think? They aren't the ones who are dying, are they? It's not their choice. - No. I can't. - But, Tina... I'm gonna get very angry with you in a minute. Well, I'll just find another way, then. - How's it going, Ziggy lad? - Fine, thanks. Listen, I didn't mean all that stuff I said. No, it was my fault. I was pissed off with my mum, not you. Mates? - Best mate I ever had. - Shut up. ? What's that writing on your hand? ? A reminder that will take you away ? Back to your life ? One that I once knew ? I'd give anything to be there with you Give us a fag. ? Sitting here in your back yard ? Wasting another night ? Let me take your hand ? One last time until we get it right ? In my room I still keep pictures of you ? Standing still, shaking your hair ? I didn't give you a choice you were told ? But you're not mad, you just feel old ? Don't know why I'm here ? Pulling out paper crowns ? When I've done nothing more ? Than let the two of us down Ziggy, can I have a word? Come on, Robbie, we're going for a little ride. - Where are we going? - Somewhere more private. - Why? - You'll see. You've brought us here to die. This is where people go who are on their last legs. - No, don't be daft. - What then? I thought you'd want some privacy. - What for? - Well, I don't know. What's with all the questions? Right, I've got to get on. Alright, Rob. What's going on, Ziggy? What do you think, lad? Tonight's the night. What are you on about? What do you think, dumb-arse? - What? Who with? - You'll see. Zig? - Gotta go. - Zig? Ziggy? What's up, Rob? Are you worried? Just relax and you'll be fine. Now, make sure you use those. - What if I need more? - You should be so lucky. Right. Hi. This is Krystal. Leave me a message for a good time. Bye. - Where are you? - Right here. I didn't recognise you then. Well, I thought I'd dress the part, like. Never worn it in a real hospital. - Usually... - Yeah, yeah, come on. Have you got the money? Don't worry, you pay me after. Is this it? Why, what's wrong? I told you it was a kids' ward. It's a private room, though. OK, I just need a few minutes to get ready. There's a toilet there and his room is down the corridor to the left. And don't worry about the nurse: she's cool. - He's lucky having you as a mate. - Yeah, that's what he is. Lucky. (sighs) What are you doing here, eh? Come in. Sophie? - Hi, Robbie. - What are you doing here? - I came to see you, you idiot. - But... How did you know? Well, I emailed you. When I got no answer, I thought you'd forgotten about me. Then Ziggy sent a reply telling me... what's happening, what happened. It's great to see you, Sophie. It's great to see you too, Robbie. The thing is, I'm kind of expecting someone. - Yeah, I know. Ziggy told me. - He told you? - He didn't ask you to...? - No. No. He didn't need to. I'm sorry about messing you around. You can have the money. What for? I didn't do anything. You keep your money, love. Really? Maybe I'll get them new shoes anyway. - Dr Palmer? - Yes? Darren, erm... Er, do you fancy going for a drink? Erm, yeah, I'd love to, but I'm trying to find my glasses. - I can't drive without them. - We could always get a cab. Or you could check your shirt pocket. - Come on, you. - Where do you want to go? Well, I think there's a really nice place at the back... - Sophie? - Yeah? Will you marry me? You're not old enough and I've got to be on a train by ten. Otherwise, yeah, alright. - I don't know how to say this... - Shh. You don't have to. Come here. You don't deserve this. Thanks, Soph. See you later, Zig. - How was it? - Amazing. I don't know how to say this. I just wish I could tell you how good. Yeah, I bet it was, you dirty git. Now move up. I'm on the edge. - Ziggy? - Hmm? - You're the fucking best. - Fuck off. You are lad, I swear. The fucking best. Poof. Jesus loves his children. He keeps them safe both in life and in death. Robbie was a much-loved member of our small community. In his life, he was always there to help, with a smile on his face. He was young and he was free, taken by our Lord sooner than we all expected and sooner than we all would have wanted. In times like these, our thoughts and prayers go to his family and friends, Mr and Mrs Wallace, and of course Ziggy. Those family and friends would like to say thank you to the nurses at the hospital who cared for Robert, who gave the family hope and belief when there was very little of both. The energy of his soul always showed. He always stood out in a crowd. That energy is above us now, around us now, watching us now. That energy will never diminish. Let us pray. Let your heart not be troubled. If you believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house, there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you because I go to a place to prepare for you. And if I shall go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and I will take you to it myself, that, where I am, you also may be, and whither I go you know, and the way you know. Amen. ? Wherever you are ? You shall be my star ? Flashing near ? Or smouldering far Zig? Here. - What's that? - It's your dad's address. I was just trying to protect you. What from, Mam? ? Wherever you are ? You shall be my star ? Flashing near ? Or smouldering far ? In my mind ? I hear the sound ? Of every happy fount ? Fresh as fresh is found ? Fresh as fresh is found - Hiya. - Hiya. I'm looking for Geoff Cavanagh. Is this his house? It is but he's walking the dog at the moment on the beach. If you down the path then take a left straight down the road, you should find him. - Thank you very much. - OK. ? Or smouldering far ? Wherever you are ? You shall be my star ? Flashing near ?
