[MASTER FU] Do you believe in magic? - [MATCH CATCHING] - I am Wang Fu, the guardian of magical gems called The Miraculous. Hiding extraordinary powers over the centuries, the Miraculous have been granted to the greatest heroes, to protect the world from evil. - [INSPIRING MUSIC] - Among them, one is most feared, for it creates Akumas! - [EERIE MUSIC] - Dark butterflies capable of turning anyone with even a hint of anger into a terrifying monster! To stop this evil, two rival heroes must rise. United, these two Miraculous possess the ultimate power! One even stronger than death. But could such selfless hearts find their courage in time?

Uh, I mean, her boyfriend. - How do you know? - It's obvious. Look at the pictures. They don't look like they like each other. Not in this one. Or this one! - Or even that one! - [ALYA] Anyway, I'll ask when I see her in action again. It could be dangerous, Alya.

You came into the world. We were a family. It's all we needed. But fate... decided otherwise. [GABRIEL SOBS] I should have been the one to go. You needed your mother more than you needed me. After she was gone, I was... I was helpless. I couldn't face the sadness in your eyes, Adrien. When I heard about the Miraculous... I would have done anything to bring your mother back! To bring her back to you. I lost myself. [GABRIEL SHUDDERS] I understand now. The only power stronger than death... is love. I failed you, my son. I don't know if you'll ever forgive me.
