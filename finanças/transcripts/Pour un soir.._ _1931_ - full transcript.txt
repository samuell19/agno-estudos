For one night Someone is coming for you. -Ms. Stella, it's your turn. -Yes. -They're waiting for you. -See you later. It's her... Here she comes. Exquisite, isn't she? But... that's Stella Maris. Do you know her? I've been coming here every night for more than a week. Could you introduce me? Ladies and gentlemen, our famous performer Stella Maris will now come among you to sing you her latest creation: "For one night!" It's her famous "for one night" song. For one night... On the stage like in her life, Stella Maris lives her life. Her affairs are as short lived as a freshly cut rose. No, I can't believe you. Her love must be something big and wonderful! I know it. What you're saying can't be true. Yes, I knew a young man who believed that. I was his commanding officer, and I was in charge of the investigation following the event. Investigation? Event? What happened? He was a sailor. Maybe it's better if I tell you tonight the story of the loves of Stella Maris. So you may understand! Please do tell. Introduce me to Stella Maris! The one I talked about earlier also met her in a place like this. It was in Toulon. What I wish for, is a girl, beautiful and well dressed, while sailing, my brunette! And if sometimes I come back to France, I'll always love her, even when I'm sailing, my brunette! And I would tell her, you're my sweetheart And I would wait for her when I'm sailing, my brunette! Bravo! Bravo! Do you want to dance? No, here, dance with him! Can I, Claude? He wants luxury chicks now! I'm glad I met you here. -Do you come here often? -It's my first time. -I'm glad to be here then. -Really? Yes. You're not right in the head, buddy! -Maguz! -Yes? Come here! Maguz, I'll grant you the leave you asked for. You can leave the harbor tonight. -Happy? -Yes, Captain! Right turn. Right turn! Forward march! -Paul! -Present! -Doidec! -Present! -Maguz! -Here! -Puech! -Here! -Monfredi. -Present! -Marais! -Present! -Liqueur! -Here! You?! You really scared me! -Oh, you deserve a good... -What? A good kissing! -How are you, mom? -Fine! Can I look at you? You're so handsome, my Jean! Even more than since your last leave. -Really? -Of course. But you must be hungry! -A bit. -So hurry and sit at the table -Mom, you know I'm here for 10 days. -That's nothing! There are leeks here! -You like them? -Yes! -And dad? -He's out fishing. -Doing well? -Yes. -Fishing works well? -Yes, it's going well right now. -I'll be able to help him, he'll be glad! -He sure will! -Here, you'll tell me if it's good. -Yep. Here, a bit more. I like leek soup. What a surprise! Hello, Miss. What are you doing here? I'm on leave, I just came back from fishing. -Are you staying for a while? -Eight days left. So we'll have some time to see each other again Yes. Your city looks nice. And the surroundings look nice too. -Could you give us a look around? -A look? Well... be our guide, so we can visit your village. I would be glad to. -Are you coming Stella? -Yes, yes. Goodbye. -See you soon? -See you soon. Ms. Stella Maris Hotel Sube & Continental. Saint-Tropez -So, you're going out? -I might. Come in. Madam, there's a sailor who wants to see you. Yes, let him in. What brings you here? I'm bringing you a letter and a glove you left on the harbor. Really? I ran after you, but you were gone. How nice of you! I would like to ask you something. Can I keep the glove? -Is that your wish. -It is! Keep it. Thanks, you're nice. -So, goodbye, miss. -Are you in a hurry? I'm going to meet some colleagues. -Will I see you tomorrow? -Anytime. -See you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. What will you do with that one? It's very simple... You see my dear Monique, what you call "love", "Love" with a capital L, well, it's a trap. Indeed... a trap for naive people. There's only desire... and repletion. And that's it. You're a cynic. I'm genuine. Do as you please. Just a reminder that Jacques will arrive from Paris without a warning as he always does. Well, Jacques... Jacques! Did time pass slowly away from me? Indeed, much slower when you were away. I would like you to stay here. Forever. You're a sweet talker... I need to get going. Already? Yes, some friends are waiting for me. Stay with me a bit longer. Come on, let's be reasonable. Shall I see you soon? Yes, maybe tomorrow, if you're nice. I will wait for you. Goodbye. He danced the java really well. -Who? -The sailor. -You find him nice? -Not bad. Same old you! I'm going to bed. -See you. -Good night. See you tomorrow. Stella. That's a strange way to come! I haven't seen you in two days! Stella... my leave ends tonight. I don't want to leave without seeing you. You're insane, Jean! Kiss me. Leave me. Jean, why don't you want to go fishing with dad anymore? Instead of chasing that Parisian girl all day long! I like it that way! My poor kid... Don't you get that this slut is making fun of you? Don't you dare say that! Didn't you forget me amongst your numerous plans? Furnished rooms You're alone? -Buy me a drink? -No, I'm broke. A shandy! -Hi Jean, how you doing buddy? -Fine and you, Louis? Good, drink anything? Seems nice. -Mimi! Glass of white wine. -Coming! So, enjoyed your leave? It was a great leave! You? Me... halfway good halfway bad. -I stayed on the ship. -Did you go into town? -Yes, yesterday evening. -50 cents! Here you go. -Here. -Thanks. What's that? -A memory... -Really? Yes... Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to sing! Quiet! Come on, Zizi, you can sing us something! Sing the "java"! Songs I know a lot, I know! But today's one it's a whole different one now, It's like a young girl and her lover It'll amaze you, make you shudder It's the java, the good ole java Its rhythm will get ya It owns you, possesses you And in a minute you'll be through And I like it, it's fun and dances with us And makes us crave the chorus Dance it and don't forget it It's the java, the good ole java Sometimes fancy people come here for a bit of fun But once they're here they wanna run They see us acting, they look pitiful They think that since we're not rich we're fools Give me the other one so I can use them! Give me that! You brute! You're hurting me! You're done hurting her? Why do you care? Music! Keep playing! Go away! Fuck off! -Is he breathing? -Go away, he needs air. You, give me your handkerchief, quickly! Here is his bag. 124...706...Second warehouse. So you didn't see him again since the end of his leave? And you don't know where he is? Madam. When your father learns this... My boy... My poor boy... Heavens! Are you hungry? Why did you desert? They said you had an affair. Is it true? Jean... Jean, my big boy! Mother. -Father isn't home? -Not yet. He knows? Policemen are looking for you. Eat a bit. Mom, I need to go. -I can't stay here. -Where will you go? Jean! Honey! -Please. -What are you doing here? And you? Jean! How nice of you to come. I'll explain to you Jacques. He's for me... Come. It's true, darling, I didn't tell you. Monique had an affair with a local. Jean... are you sad? Are you crying? No. I'm not crying because of her. I'm crying for everything that's dying inside me right now. For everything I believed in. You can't understand. His corpse was never found. This tragedy shook me to my core. All this because of Stella Maris... Let's leave. timings by DACIAN translation by Gundenspand
