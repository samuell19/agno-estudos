"Certain things are too difficult to understand for adults. Only children understand them." Jean Diaz. THE PASSAGE You know that Elizabeth will leave next year? It's going to be a drama. I don't care, I'll choose another one in 2nd class. I thought you wanted to marry her? I can't, I'm too young. Age doesn't matter with marriage. Don't be silly, Dad. You could ask her grandmother for her hand. You're in love with her, right? Hey, are you in love with her? - Who? - Elizabeth. - Yeah. - Good. So you should marry her, and have children. Really? Oh no, a child can't be father of another child. Too bad! I'd love to have children! And she? Does she love you too? Yep. How do you know? We've kissed each other. - Where? - At school. No. Where did you put the kiss? In her mouth. In her mouth? That's really something! "In" or "on"? In her mouth. In her mouth? In here! Well then... Salt! You haven't put salt on! Shit! Don't say rude words, Dad! So, she loves you. Eh? She loves you like nobody else, right? Are you sure? How many guys does she kiss? That's the first thing you must ask her. She only kisses one boy, and that's me! Are you sure? Do you watch her? Yeah. Do you use a detective? Don't be stupid, Dad! How do you know then? My buddies have watched her. Oh, your buddies! You have to be careful with buddies. It's possible they don't tell you the truth. Actually, she does play with them a lot. I don't really know why. Oh no! She plays with them too!? If I were you, David, I'd keep a close eye on her. Go see her and ask her... "Who is it you love? Those others or me?" "Make up your mind now!" And she'll answer... "Oh David, don't be mad at me!" But I am mad at you! I'm fed up with seeing you play with those guys! Then she'll know that you love her. And she'll say to you... "But David... You're the one for me!" And believe me, if you take good care of her, she'll stick with you! So why did Mum leave us? Why did Mum leave? Are you finished eating, samurai? You'll be late for school. Finished? When was it built? No idea, but it's pretty old. Are there any easements on the property? No idea, but you're the estate agent! But I've never seen a place like it. You'll be blown away when you see it. It's completely isolated, but looks directly onto the beach. It could be out of a Magritte. A who? Forget it. It is a magical place. David will like it. I get wary about "magical places". Speaking of David... aren't you coming to Catherine's birthday this evening? I wasn't invited. Jean, do it for David. She's his mother. He isn't invited either. Apart from which, we're going on holidays. By the way... I think I've found a financier for your film. I wouldn't want your sponsor. A rich frozen food manufacturer. I'm not for sale, Patrick. So, where is this shack? Right over there. Seeking new partner Desired gender? Male? Female? Male. More precisely: This time, strong. Astrologer, banker, librarian, fire worker, pilot, boatman, porter, hearing aid technician, jeweler, biscuit maker, press attach?, lawyer, insurance agent, cleaner, cylinder sander... Anything new in this program? Positive. To celebrate the new program artistic professions were saved. Oh yes. A creative person. An artist. I adore the muses. I need the list... of the five most famous art personalities and their biographies. "The Weeping Death" by Jean Diaz. All information about Jean Diaz needed. Don't worry, David. Your dad will come. He's never been late before. Maybe he was held up at work. Want to wait for him inside with me? Here he comes! Have a nice holiday, David! Thanks. You too! Come on, David, hurry up! Goodness me! So this is it... No more school. I had to wait so long. I know. I had a lot of work. You'd never been late before. Yes, you're right, David. I'll make it up to you. Guess where we're going this evening. Look in the back. It's a real fishing rod! - Whose is it? - Yours. - All my own? - Yes. Now you'll feed me, OK? Can we get going? - Where to? - The seaside. Or do you want to fish in the living room? To the seaside? Yes. I bought a house right by the water. Super! Mum can't take you until mid-July. That's huge! Come on, fasten your seat belt. Screw on the steering system of Jean Diaz' car is loose. Impossible. This man isn't on the agenda. Then we'll put Jean Diaz on the agenda. Command accepted. How's your story going? What? What story? Your animated film. Today I've written a nice scene. It plays out on a beach. On a beach filled with garbage. There are tractors, trucks, and piles of shit everywhere. Piles of what? Piles of garbage, I mean. And... in this domain of sh... I mean in this domain by the sea, there are the two heroes of my story... Him and her. Two young people in love. They look happy. They don't care about the mess because they love each other. Then a bird flies by... A dove. It comes from the city and is covered in dust. The lovers embrace, and the dove that flies and flies... Look out, Dad! Come with your glasses! Don't crowd, there's enough for everybody. Cheers! Cheers everybody! - Be careful, they're crystal glasses. - Catherine, to a good year... and happy birthday. - Cheers! - Was it alright? Good enough? - Delicious. I love champagne. Temperatures between 23' and 28'... It's left over from my ex-husband. But I never turn on before dessert! Speaking of dessert: where is it? Dessert! Dessert! Dessert! - Coming! Don't get nervous. Yesterday I saw your TV commercial. It was great. Simply superb! Wait, I only said two sentences... With Asprim, no more depression! Had to say it! Don't laugh at me! Today's headline story for our viewers... This afternoon, Jean Diaz was the victim of a serious road accident. Jean! He was on vacation with his son David. David had more luck than his father, and according to the doctors, he has no internal injuries, and would not have suffered any trauma. My David! He can thank the fact that he put on the seat-belt. According to the police report Jean Diaz was not wearing his. Deeply disappointed, he had stopped writing and film-making 10 years ago. He was, as he called it, on an artistic strike. But it is known that he was working on a new project. An animated film with the title "Blood". A cry of alarm, with the main theme being violence. Dad! Catherine, wait! His wife! Let me through! No, that's not possible! Sorry! But they are my son and my husband! Back! 7th floor. - I am a friend of this lady. - We can't let everyone through! 36.5. Reduce dose. Ready to stop transfusion. Transfusion stopped. Blood pressure normal. You can fill it. PEG? He should be out of danger. Great work! And now it's my turn! Sudden drop in blood pressure. Blood pressure's dropping! Why?! Defibrillator... Ready to defibrillate? - Ready! - Make it quick. OK? Good. Blood pressure normal again. Prepare to switch off ventilator. No, wait a moment. Turn off the power! - What's happening? - Shit! - Damn, where's the emergency power? - Just a moment. - Thank God! - Heavy bleeding... - The pump is ready. [Breakdown in the emergency unit] - Breathe in! I can... [Command accepted.] OK, I'm clamping off. Checkmate! - What happened? - The unit's defective. - Blood pressure? - The patient is quite blue. We won't make it. - Cardiac arrest. - Do you feel anything? - No! - Now? No. What rotten luck! Stand up! You look exactly like the one I've created in my film. I appear to those who have imagined me. What happened to my son? Don't worry. He's not dead. Did you cause the accident? Why? To your advantage, human. To your advantage. You see, I studied you, and I know everything about you. I know your preferences, your opinions, your passions, your struggles. I liked very much the film you called "The Weeping Death". I watched it seven times. I think that it comes very close to what I experience every day. It was good that you knew I didn't choose this work. And that, if it exists, you're partly responsible. How? You humans! I don't force people to kill each other. I only measure out the number. Well, I organised the accident to your advantage... ...so as to have the opportunity to meet with you! For I can be much more useful to you than you can imagine. Be useful? But I'm dead. Death and life... look as much alike as you two! What would you think about death, if he gave you the opportunity to save your fellow man? You don't answer. You were much more loquacious defending your project. When you were planning, merely through the power of the film, to stop all violence. As you said... If I could focus in my pictures... ...if only for a moment... ...all the distress in the world... ...maybe blood would stop flowing! What have you achieved with those fine words? Have you renounced your quest? Don't you want that film to be made? Of course I do. Well. Then it must happen now! But how? Don't worry about details. Devote yourself entirely to your work. No, I won't do that. Jean Diaz doesn't make a pact with death. He only fights him. And best way is by saying no. Say no to me? You should learn that your lovely little boy is in a coma right now. David? In a coma? - But you did say that... - I only said he's not dead. And that's true. But now his life depends on the toss of a coin. Heads or tails? Life or death? It's for you to decide! Save him! I'll do anything you ask. You'll make a film for me. Yes, but you have to save my son. Well, that sounds reasonable. We'll shake on it. Severe heart rhythm disturbances. Motivity resumed! He's trying to breathe by himself. Take off the oxygen. He's succeeding... He's breathing. May this hand be the pledge of your given word! My little darling, you're alive! Happy birthday, Catherine Hi, David. You okay? I'll be with you in a minute. As soon as I take off the mask. Did you sleep well? Won't you talk to me now? Do you want something to eat? It's already past 1 o'clock. David, from now on, I insist that you answer me. Just say either yes or no! Do you want to eat something? No. Speak up, I can't hear you! No! What do you mean: no? No. So you won't eat anything? No. As you wish. The fridge is full. You know where to find it. You're not to wear that jacket. Please let me make you something. I'd really like to. Pretty please! Is this about getting revenge on me, David? Don't you think I'm punished enough as it is? Are you mad at me because Dad is gone? You know very well that I adored your father. And you know I love you, too. What happened between your father and me... ...was a stupid thing. Really, really stupid. And I know it was my fault. There are things you don't understand. You're still a bit too young. I swear, if I had my time over, I'd never leave... Because I know now that I wouldn't be able to prevent what happened. But you must understand that you are my only family now. So please, David... Give me a chance. Mum, I must tell you something. You can talk to me about anything. But promise me you won't tell anyone. I promise, darling. Dad isn't dead, Mum. He's a prisoner... ...somewhere! "Blood" or The Testament of an Old Madman. I dedicate this film to my son David and his descendants. Patrick! I'm glad that you could come so quickly... I really need to talk to you. I ordered that for you. Okay. What's happened? It's about David. He worries me. I don't know what to do about him. He says weird things... ...that give me the creeps. You said you understood his resentment! No, it's not that. Since I'm back home, I feel that's getting better. David is convinced that Jean isn't dead. But he believes he got caught and imprisoned by a beggar... ...who also cut off his hand. A beggar? Well. What's next? So... What? What am I supposed to say to him? I... I don't know. Nothing. Nothing at all? I can't leave him believing this! Why not? Jean also believed in totally absurd stories. Think for example of 'The Passage'. Didn't he tell you about 'The Passage'? No. Well, 'The Passage' was a big deal for him. Lately, it was all he ever talked about. He was convinced... ...that there's a kind of passage between... ...between life and death. Or between death and life. This beggar represents the passage. That fits. Let David believe it. Maybe he can comfort himself this way. It may relieve his pain. A loud shot was heard in the empty circus tent. But then there was silence again. It was the same silence which prevailed in the marquee, since no spectators came anymore. The old clown couldn't bear to be unemployed. Society has killed him, as he killed himself in the show, night after night. David? I really like this. Why don't you show me anything of your work? Don't you trust me? I find that most disappointing. No thanks, I never drink. Do you think I don't know what you're doing? The blood shed by the people runs from their wounds... as if from an inexhaustible source. Jean Diaz... his great idea! How can you know that? It speaks to me! Have you never wondered... what's behind these bars? Well... There are eyes. Eyes that watch you. - What sort of eyes? - Cameras. They can tell me everything! You spy on me? What do you want? I have no imagination... So I make use of yours. Because I fully intend to give life to your ideas, on Earth. - On Earth? - Yes! Scene by scene, I'll apply everything you create here. And people will repent that they didn't listen to you. They haven't understood anything! It's meant to create awareness! It's not a program of destruction! That's your interpretation. Everyone has the freedom to interpret your films for himself. My version satisfies me completely! Thanks to you, I've been freed from the drudgery that I've been stuck with for centuries. Because the one who says "No more earth!" says "No more dead people to collect." And he who says "No more dead people to collect" is saying there's no place for me, Death, to do the collecting! No! Space report 3-0-2-2-9 from Commander Thibault. Get ready to land the ship! Mum, come quickly! Mum, hurry up! Come to the door! - What is it? - He's there outside! - Who's there? - The beggar who cut off Dad's hand! Don't let him in! He came to get me! Don't open the door, I beg you! It takes you forever to open. Should I catch my death? Can I... may I come in? Yes, of course, Patrick. Sorry. It was the same shadow, Mum! It really was! David! Well, Patrick... what can we do for you? I wanted to see how you're doing. Excuse me, I'm going to dress. - Of course. David, keep Patrick company, please. - Well, how are you? - Good. What are you watching? A story about flying saucers. Do you believe in flying saucers? - Of course! Don't you? Oh well. I don't know... That looks bad! You know, you shouldn't eat that junk! Sweets are bad for your teeth. But I'm going to lose them anyway. Your first teeth? But what about afterwards? Then I can think it over. Of course. You're absolutely right. You know, your father must have had a feeling lately that.. He had asked me to give you something, should he... Well, how can I say? If he'd been obliged to go away. He told me to give it to you and nobody else. It's lucky that your mum isn't here now. She doesn't know about it. Well... all I know is... that it's a videotape. He didn't want to say more about it, and I know nothing. Here, it's yours. But don't lose it. It was very important for Jean. Do you think that Dad is in heaven now? Of course he's in heaven. Your dad was a very nice person. I don't know if that's true. He wouldn't have left me alone. But David, you're not alone. We're still here. If he's not in heaven... Where is he then, in your opinion? I don't know. But I know who he's with. I saw him at the hospital. He's with the old beggar. The beggar? Yes! And he also cut off his hand. Mum doesn't believe me. I know she doesn't believe me. No, don't say that. It's not that she doesn't believe you.... How can I explain... Do you know what your father always said? When it came to things which science and logic wouldn't accept... Those slightly delusional things like saucers and everything. He used to say... "There are things too difficult for adults to understand." "Only children understand them." And your story of the beggar may be one of those things. You can't expect your mum or me to understand something too hard for us. Tell me... What's your beggar like? He has a huge, black coat... ...which is all ripped. And a thing on his head, to keep it dry in the rain. Sort of like your coat, but you can't see his face. His hands are very weird. And a large spear with a sharp hook on the end... That's what he cut off Dad's hand with. Perfect...! He's back at work. Hello to you, David. You aren't afraid, are you David? Once I said to you: "Should I not be here anymore..." "I'm still with you anyway." "Remember?" You see, I'm here. You're not crying now, are you? A samurai never cries. We're both samurai, aren't we? Wipe your nose! Not with your sleeve, with a hanky. There you are, much better! I love you, you know! I love you like 50,000 videos, 10 million decals for your album. That's a lot, huh? It's never much when you love. I've decided to make this video for you, because I know that I will soon have to leave. I didn't want to leave anything with a lawyer. You'd have some old guy explaining things to you. I prefer to tell you directly. He'd never understand anyway. He'd just declare that I was crazy. Do you remember the script I worked on while you were in school? Everything I know about life... and everything I want to leave you, is written down there. You must read it. But knowing you, you've already visited the attic, and it's done. Now listen carefully... You've had to watch a lot about me on television. You know, people are always wise after the event. The only thing that's true in all this is... that all my life I was looking for a way to help people to live without violence and in peace. And when I say violence, I mean not only the sort we see, such as in war. I mean the little crumbs of violence that pile up every day, that we ignore. It's like when you drop a sweet-wrapper onto the street. You might think it's no big deal. But if you look at the city's garbage dump... you wonder where these mountains of garbage come from. And then you remember your sweet-wrapper, which was so very small... and you don't understand. Violence in life is like the sweet-wrapper. You only realise the importance when there are many of them. The worst thing about it is... that although everyone today knows about the garbage dump... they continue to drop their sweet-wrappers. Because they stop thinking of garbage, once it is burned. And just as quickly, they forget the images of war and torture... ...or the "news items" that they see on TV. That's why I've written down everything. So they don't forget. Where I go now, I don't think I can make a film out of it. So I'm asking you to do it, if you wish, once you're grown up. Preserve it with great care... It's the testament of an old madman. One more thing, David. Don't be mad at your Mum. She loves you. Take good care of her. I'll watch over you, from where I'm going. If you think of me as deeply as I do of you... ...then it is certain, David... ...that we'll meet again. Have no fear. Just trust me. I love you, you know. I love you. Dad... International Blood Study Centre That's how your movie ends. In a deluge of blood. That's quite an idea! What? Is he still in his production studio? Who does he think he's fooling? That wretch... ...of a human! Human... no! He's discovered the passage! It won't happen! A balloon for the kid? Would you like a balloon, pet? - Could I get 3? - Of course. 3 red ones. Why? Take different colours! No, I prefer red. Ah, he knows what he wants. Oh yes, he sure does! How much? 6 francs, beautiful! Thank you. Cheers, little man! You know, Mum, I love you very much. Oh, I also love you so much. Isolation of Catherine and David Diaz. Command accepted. Oh, a haunted house! Can we go in it? No, I'm afraid. - Please, do it for me! - All right! Thank you, you're the best mum in the world! Give me the balloons! - You alright? - Of course! You fixed properly? - Will you be scared? - No, I hope not. David! Great! - David! - Mum, that's the beggar! David! Answer me, my darling! What happened? Monsieur! Stop the ghost train immediately! Stop the machinery! You must stop it! My son was sitting right in front of me. Just before the exit in the last curve he wasn't there anymore. Help me! If you don't stop the train, he might be run over. Turn the system off! Do something! Turn off the system, otherwise David will be run over! In your place I would return. Your son is in danger, human! If you're not by my side to protect him, an accident can easily happen. Don't you touch my son! Otherwise I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Don't touch my son. If you don't want something to happen to him... ...then retrace your steps! David. David. Oh, how touching! Excuse me if I disturb your little get-together, human! But I must show you something that will certainly interest you. Come on up! Welcome! Come on in! Come over here! I'll give you the lord-and-master's tour. This is my control room... The place from which I monitor everything. I can do this, thanks to the excellent equipment. The fruits of modern science. When I first started, I had nothing but this old scythe. Today my weapon is a video information system. But I've kept the scythe, as a keepsake. These monitors receive pictures from around the world. I can also provoke conflicts anywhere, just as I please. I can intervene in major developments on your planet. And, with great accuracy, I can regulate the birth rates, and, more particularly, the death rates. No! Why no? You don't have the ability to regulate. You're only the performer. The performer?! Then who do you think decided your death? The one who also decided on my life. I alone decided on your death. Nobody told me what to do. I rigged your accident! No one else! But it wasn't my time. I'm the one who made that decision! You don't decide anything at all. Nothing that concerns me! I should be on holiday with my son. You've no right to take my life. You aren't my death! You've no power over me! Do you really believe that? Well, have a look at the power I have! Do you remember your project, that was so close to your heart? Your testament, as you called it. I have completed it for you. Watch this! David! What have you done to him? I know you. You're in Dad's animated film. Tell me where he is! Dad! David... David... David... I beg of you... not in the repository! The blood will destroy him! I'll do anything you want. I beg of you! But I don't need you anymore, human! The process for the end of the world has been set in motion. The earth destroys itself. Just like in your animated film. You've broken our pact! You've no right to touch my son. - I take back my word! - No! David... David... David! David. Watch out! No! No! You have no right! Command accepted. What are you doing now, human? I'm going to save my son. And you won't stop me! Program for the destruction of earth deleted. No! No! No! Dad, don't leave me alone. Dad, don't leave me alone. David! Order... to eliminate Jean Diaz. Impossible. Jean Diaz isn't on any list. David! David! Dad, where are you? Answer me! Restarting the process... ...for the destruction of the earth. Major impossibility... main circuits damaged. No! David! David! Dad! No! If you think of me as deeply as I do of you... ...then it is certain, David, that we meet again. Revised subtitles by FatPlank
