[Ronald Reagan] …advances in science and technology. Opportunities and jobs will multiply as we cross new thresholds of knowledge and reach deeper into the unknown. Nowhere is this more important than our next frontier, space. Tonight, I am directing NASA to develop a permanently manned space station, and to do it within a decade. [applause] [girl] Hi, Dad. Have you gotten your Christmas presents yet? [man] Yeah, thank you for the T-shirt. [girl] I think I put, like, a bell in there that was like, "Number One Dad." - Got the bell and the card too, yeah. - [girl] Yeah. [man] The T-shirt was in there too. [girl] Yeah. - [man] Love you, Charlotte. - [girl] Love you too. [applause] Mr. Secretary General, delegates to the United Nations, ladies and gentlemen, we meet again in the quest for peace. [man] President Kennedy made a speech to the United Nations in September of 1963 and made the offer to bring the Soviet Union in and to make them a part of the Apollo program. [JF Kennedy] Finally, in a field where the United States and the Soviet Union have a special capacity in the field of space, there is room for new cooperation, for further joint efforts in the regulation and exploration of space. I include among these possibilities a joint expedition to the Moon. Space offers no problems of sovereignty. Why, therefore, should man's first flight to the Moon be a matter of national competition? November of that year, he wrote a memo to NASA telling them he would like to have them come back in two weeks and tell them why the Soviet Union should not be a part of Apollo. President Kennedy was killed on the 22nd of November, and that never happened. That vision that Kennedy had of working together as partners finally materialized and is happening today. That is the space station we're flying right now. [man] There has never been any other collaborative engineering project of this scope, size or challenge, in my opinion. You are basically taking pieces of hardware that may have been built thousands of miles apart, that had never been in the same room, never touched each other. Then you have to put them together in space, in a vacuum, going at 18,000 miles an hour, and they have to work the first time they touch and not cause shocks or not leak or have any other problems that of course are disastrous in space. And they all worked. They all worked when we put them together. I flew three times in space. My third mission was as the commander of the International Space Station early in its assembly in life. I was trained for several possible spacewalks. I ended up doing one where we were attaching the cables to power up a new compartment that had come up and test out a new piece of equipment that the Russians had sent up there. It's an all-day affair to get ready for it. You have to have all the right equipment, we have to prepare the station as if we can't get back inside and have to come in a different way, and then you've got to go through all the procedures to make sure your suit is working right before you go outside. It's a whole different experience being on the outside of the station. We're here in Washington and the Washington Monument's downtown. If you could imagine someone asks you to go out the windows at the top of the monument and wash the outside. You open the window, you look out. There's nothing for 500 feet below you. So you open the hatch on the station. You look out. There's nothing except the atmosphere for 250 miles below you. You'd be very careful about making sure your tethers were always attached, because the Russian suit did not have a little rocket pack on the back to fly you back if you got loose. About an hour or so in, when I was feeling pretty comfortable, I found myself on top of the station, and so I put my feet under the hand-holds and I stood up on top of the station. Imagine standing on top of a 747 and holding on to just a little rope. That's what it was like standing up there, because you had the fuselage of the station, you had the wings of the solar arrays, and you're on top of the world, and it's all just unrolling beneath you. [applause] Throughout all history, humankind has had only one place to call home, our planet Earth. Beginning this year, 1998, men and women from 16 countries will build a foothold in the heavens, the International Space Station. With its vast expanses, scientists and engineers will actually set sail on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery and unlimited potential. [applause] [man] The space station is really like being on a ship, sailing some sea. We've drawn a lot of legacy that we all have as seafaring nations. What the space station provides is our chance to become a spacefaring civilization. My name is Bill Shepherd, and I was the commander of Expedition 1, the first crew on the space station that came aboard in November of 2001. When I was a young boy, the space program was starting and everybody wanted to be an astronaut. I didn't really have a good prospect of that until I was through college and in the navy, and a chance came up to apply for the space shuttle program, and that's how I got to NASA. When I was little, I used to cut up two-by-fours and make little boats. I'm still in the boat-building business. It's just in orbit. I don't really know why I was chosen to be the commander for the first expedition. In my time in the navy I worked with many foreign counterparts and there was a great amount of common sense and a little bit of kind of backyard diplomacy required for that. I don't know if that was why I got picked, but that helped me a great deal. There was a lot of controversy when I was named to be the leader of the first crew. I had two exceptional Russian cosmonauts as crewmates, but many of the political leadership in Russia were quite unhappy that, from their standpoint, the Americans had taken over their space program. [man in Russian] When I was really young, my dreams were more down-to-earth. However, they were always about technology. I liked machinery. Big, complicated machinery. As I headed towards my high-school graduation, I read quite a lot of quality sci-fi and thought it would be great to work in the space industry if I were lucky.

I was old enough by that moment to realize that the odds of me becoming a cosmonaut weren't that high. My name is Sergei Krikalev. I'm a cosmonaut. The first crew started to come together, and as I had experience of working on both Mir and the shuttle, I was selected for that first crew. At first, Bill Shepherd and I were the only ones there. Shortly afterwards, Yuri Gidzenko was added to our crew. So that was the crew, Bill Shepherd, Yuri Gidzenko, and myself. We trained for nearly four years for that first long-term mission. My name is Ginger Kerrick. I am currently a division chief in the Flight Integration Division at NASA Johnson Space Center. In the summer of '95, I took my application and marched it down to the astronaut selection office, turned it in. They had received over 3,000 applicants and had selected 120 to interview, and I was one of the 120. I was 26 years old, and I thought, "Oh, my gosh, my dream has come true." But when we went through interview week, they did medical tests and they found that I had kidney stones, and there was a new medical disqualification enacted that year that if your body shows the ability to form a single stone, it is a lifetime disqualification from consideration. So I was devastated, but I had started this new job where I got to teach astronauts in the Mission Operations Directorate, and I thought, well, maybe astronaut wasn't for me. Maybe there's another path that I was destined to take. Maybe I'm 26 years old, and I don't have everything figured out, so how about I be open-minded and see where this leads? Do you wanna go through these procedures or do you want a general tour? - General tour would be excellent. - Okay, let's start up here. [Ginger] I was assigned to support the first crew that was getting ready to fly on board the yet-to-be-constructed International Space Station. So I got assigned to Captain William Shepherd, Sergei Krikalev, and Yuri Gidzenko. [Ginger] Here's the person who's going to live in there. [Bill] Sergei, clean up your room. Open the door and throw everything out. [Ginger] Those guys were great. From an age perspective, Yuri was more my age, Sergei was about the age of my older brother, and Shep was 20 years older and kind of like a father figure. So managing those three personalities took a unique skill set. [Bill] This was a new vehicle. It had components from 15 different countries. The pieces were not gonna come together until they met each other in orbit. Many of the techniques and procedures we needed to operate it had not been written yet. So our training was very much "fly by the seat of your pants." [Sergei in Russian] The training was intense and unusual, even by modern standards. The level of our training was well above average, because we studied a lot of things just in case there's an emergency we cannot predict. We trained both in Houston and here in Star City. It was a very interesting and friendly experience exchange, information exchange, emotional exchange, impressions exchange, because everyone could learn something new. [Ginger] It was a wonderful experience, and if I had never watched the news, I would never have suspected that there would be any antagonism between Russia and the US, based on my experience. Both of us have been in competition since the early '60s, trying to get to space, the old space race, but now we recognize that if we're gonna go beyond low-Earth orbit, if we're gonna go to the Moon or Mars, the only way to do that is to do it together. [Bill] When we did land survival, we did it in the winter outside of Moscow, and it was very wet and cold. We were in a boilerplate capsule, as if we had just landed, we got out in our survival suits, and we had to build a little camp and then survive. It was an extremely good experience to bond the crew, and for time for us to really get to know each other and contribute to what each of us could offer as strengths and weaknesses. [Bill] We've been here for two days. Our launch is three days away, on Tuesday. Everything in the vehicle looks ready to go. Crew's well trained. We've been ready for probably a year to go fly in space. It's just kind of a quiet time, thinking about everything we have to do once we start flying, and Tuesday morning, we'll be ready. [interviewer] Beth, any thoughts? Just still, I think, hard to believe that we're actually here, and just looking forward to watching a great launch, so… [Bill] We launched on the 31st of October, 2000. We're out in Baikonur way out in the desert in Kazakhstan. We sign our names to the door of the room that we're in. I drew a little picture of Space Station. [commentator] Bill Shepherd's now joined by Johnson Space Center Director, Mr. George Abbey. This is just before the crew members were set to head over to the suit-up room this morning shortly after wake-up. [Bill] We have a little breakfast, and then we go out to the launch pad in a bus. [commentator] Bill Shepherd, the commander of Expedition 1, along with Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev, now boarding a bus. The crew members will again head over to the suit-up room. [Bill] The Russian approach to rules is often quite different than the US, and that's one of the things you get to appreciate sometimes. In the United States, we have a very regimented procedure for how you deal with friends and family right before the launch. I waved goodbye to my wife about two hours before we launched, and then we're driving away in the bus, and I saw her through the window. But then right as we're getting ready to go out to the rocket, she surprised me from behind. Whoa! This was… It was great, but it was just kind of an unexpected moment that you would not find in the US program. [commentator] Bill Shepherd, on the left… on the right of the commander. Now heading to the launch pad. [Ginger] I was in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and as soon as they shut the hatch, I started hyperventilating, because I felt like my brother and my dad, basically, were locked on a rocket, and I couldn't process that. And one of the Russian generals got me and he's moving me through the crowd, and he says… [speaks Russian] That means, "It's the mother of the crew." And he was trying to part the crowd so I could see my crew on video, and it made me feel a lot better. We became a family, and we all still stay in touch to this day, so it was a wonderful experience. - [woman] Ignition. - [man] T-minus ten seconds, nine… [Bill] The day, it was very foggy. We wouldn't have launched in the United States because you need a little bit of visibility, which we didn't have that day in Kazakhstan, but the Russians fired up and flew right through it. [commentator] Lift-off of the Soyuz rocket, beginning the first expedition to the International Space Station and setting the stage for permanent human presence in space. [Ginger] Physically, you feel the heat, you feel the vibrations, but I guess because I had such a personal connection to them, it felt… I could feel it here. It was this culmination of the actual physical event that was going on but actually the last four years of my life and the personal connection I had with these people. It was overwhelming and I don't know that I can describe what it felt like to watch that particular crew launch. [Sergei in Russian] Yes! We've arrived! We've finally arrived! [conversation in Russian] [Bill] It's uncomfortable, somewhat awkward, but the vehicle itself was very safe and we had a good ride to orbit, and my sense of surety, if you will, that we were gonna have a good mission was pretty high. [commentator] In a few seconds, we will have the docking, the first mechanical contact. [commentator 2] Six meters distance. Five. Four. [woman] Four. [commentator 2] Three meters. - Two meters. - [commentator] Two. [woman] Three. - [commentator] And… - [commentator 2] And… [commentator] Contact. We have a successful docking. - The people are applauding here. - [commentator 2] I can confirm that. So the first crew of the International Space Station have reached their home. We docked on the second of November. It took a while to equalize the pressure and then open the hatch, and then our mission started. [in Russian] The first time! The new station. The new International Space Station. [in English] Okay, it's this. [Bill] You might think the commander wanted to be the first one through the hatch, but I really didn't wanna do that for two reasons. One is Sergei and Yuri had had a lot of experience with docking and opening hatches and doing it correctly. I was the neophyte. I didn't think it was my place to get in front of them and try and do that. But the second thing was, as the commander, I wanted one of them to have the honor of being the first one in. [in Russian] Somebody has to turn on the lights. [Sergei in Russian] I remember knowing by touch where the switches were, so we switched on the lights, and it was kind of a seminal event. ♪ I wonder how a gap can feel this much ♪ ♪ How a gap can feel Like something this big ♪ ♪ How it multiplies in my veins ♪ ♪ And in my blood and home ♪ [Sergei] Well, I think looking back, we can see it was a historic moment. But back then we were completely immersed in our work. We realized that we had reached a station that was in a dormant mode and none of the systems could really support the crew's functions. Ahead of us there was rather important and rather urgent work to activate all of the station systems for it to begin to work as it should, supporting the crew's lives. [Bill] We had about an hour and a half before we were headed over Europe and we were gonna have a live press conference with the ground. And we had to find a TV cable, we had to hook it up, set the TV up, turn the lights on, make sure the sound was right. We couldn't find any of this stuff. So we're scrambling around inside the module like madmen to figure out what this stuff was and where to set it up, and we did it just in time. Just as the crackling started when the radio said we're in contact with the ground and we turned the TV on and it was done. It was frantic. The first expedition on Space Station requests permission to take the radio call sign Alpha. [man laughs] [man] Temporarily taken as Alpha. Go ahead. Have a good day. The little red light went off, we turned the camera off, and we were just sitting there saying we're done with the day. [insects buzz] [woman] I grew up in rural Iowa, in the south-western part of the state, on a farm. Closest town had 32 people when I was growing up. It's now, like, only 11 or so, so it's pretty rural. Not a lot of folks around. The cornfields, the soybean rows, the rolling hills, it's just a beautiful area to grow up. The night skies, of course, are wonderful. There's just not a lot of light pollution around. I remember as a kid looking at the stars and watching for meteorites as they would enter the atmosphere. [man] Okay, Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now. [Neil Armstrong] Okay, I just checked, getting back up to that first step, Buzz. It's not even collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up. [woman] The night of the Moon landing, July 20th, 50 years ago, which is kind of amazing to me to think of at this point, but I was nine years old, and that was past our bedtime. So it was a big deal to even just get to stay up and watch in our pajamas as they took those first steps on the Moon. [Armstrong] Okay, I'm gonna step off the LM now. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. [woman] It left an imprint in me, gave me a desire to want to be an explorer like those guys. My name is Peggy Whitson, and I'm a former astronaut. As a youngster I was pretty quiet. I didn't really tell a lot of people I wanted to become an astronaut. It wasn't until I got to college that I started sharing my goal. My parents were always extremely supportive, even though I really don't think my mother much cared for the idea of me getting into a rocket. [laughs] I applied to be an astronaut for a course of ten years before I was selected. Over those ten years they were having selections every two years and I was being rejected on a bi-yearly cycle, getting these wonderful little postcards saying I was rejected. I think just some of that farmer-stubborn, never-give-up kind of thing kept me going. Looking back on it, it doesn't seem rational or logical that I would keep pushing and keep pushing, and keep trying in spite of being rejected all the time.

The rejections will be discouraging, but in your typical style, you will just keep trying.

[reporter] Peggy Whitson, rocketing towards the International Space Station. [Peggy] "Believe it or not, you will spend more time in space than any other American astronaut, and earn the nickname Space Ninja. You will grow soybeans on orbit, while your father will grow soybeans on Earth. You will walk in space ten times. You will find that living in space can actually become a home.

You will learn that you are so much more than you are capable of and more than you might imagine or even dream. Sincerely, the older you." ♪ And I won't turn my back on this ♪ [in Russian] I'm Sergey Volkov, a Russian pilot and cosmonaut. My father, Aleksandr Volkov, also went to space, to the Mir station. I was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine, when my father was an instructor pilot. Then he was selected to join a cosmonaut group and our family moved to Star City in 1978. I was four at the time, so it feels like I've lived my whole life in Star City. Because my father was a cosmonaut, I was seeing not just the public side of the profession. I saw it from the inside, and maybe that's why I didn't dream of becoming a cosmonaut as a child. This profession seemed so heroic and so difficult to me. When I grew up, I made the conscious decision to take on the responsibility and accept the risks. It was strange because my father was the commanding officer and he learned about me joining by looking through case files of the candidates selected for the physical. So he came home one night with a question, "Have you decided to become a cosmonaut?" So we talked, and that's when my mother learned about me wanting to be a cosmonaut. Of course, it came as a surprise for them, to put it mildly. He came to all three of my take-offs. It's a complicated mix of feelings, but of positive feelings, because you train very hard, for a long time. It took me ten years. My father led me to the rocket. We walked together, he supported me, we walked from the bus across the take-off pad, and he walked with me to the lift. Then when we were lifted up inside the rocket, into our own spaceship, we were closed in. You hear the rocket come alive. Valves open, fuel moves, the liquids, you're inside, you're one with it, and when the launch actually starts, you hear the engines work down there, this calm vibration, the right kind. The second the rocket goes, that first overload, these three people, not just me, but the whole crew, are the happiest people on Earth.

I know it sounds weird, and I'm not kind of a believer in this kind of weird stuff like this, but it's true, I had this feeling that someday I would live in a really small space, and it wouldn't be particularly unpleasant being there. And once I flew into space and lived in the crew quarters on the International Space Station, it just seemed like my childhood memory. Very strange. My name's Scott Kelly. I am a former NASA astronaut. Spent a lot of time on the space station. Over 500 days. My family was me, my twin brother, Mark, my mom and dad, who were both police officers. I was a very rambunctious kid that could not pay attention in school. I know that's somewhat counter-intuitive to what people think of an astronaut. You think, "That guy's an astronaut. He must have been the smartest kid in the class, the overachiever." But that was not me. ["(Don't Fear) The Reaper" playing] I was the kid in the back of the room, always distracted, looking out the window, looking at the clock, trying to make it go faster. [school bell rings] I was a good kid, you know. But I had no motivation at all to do anything related to school. ♪ Come on, baby ♪ ♪ Don't fear the reaper ♪ ♪ Baby, take my hand ♪ Thinking back to when we were kids, I don't know how our mother didn't, like, send us away to some home. We were probably teenagers when finally she says, "Can you guys just please stop running everywhere?" And I felt, like, "It's not possible. I cannot not run everywhere," or do whatever seemed like taking unnecessary risk as a kid. I went to college because I didn't know what else to do, and that seemed like the thing to do, so I went, but really was on kind of that fast-track to being a, you know, first-year college dropout. Then one day I'm just walking across the campus, and I happen to go into the college bookstore, saw this book on the end of the aisle, had a really cool title, it had a red, white and blue cover, just made me wanna pick it up, looked exciting. I remember just lying there for a few days on my unmade, college freshman, dorm-room bed and just read the stories of the fighter pilots that later became test pilots that became the original Mercury, Gemini and Apollo astronauts. The book was The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe. It inspired me to want to do what they did. Sometimes you mention that to people and they're, like, you know, 18-year-old kid reads a book, decides he or she is gonna become a NASA astronaut. That's a giant leap. But, in retrospect, really what it was was a bunch of much, much smaller, manageable steps, just one built upon the other. Become good student, go into the military, fly fighter planes off the aircraft carrier, become a test pilot, and then maybe at least I would have a chance. I did apply. My twin brother also applied. I figured there was no way I was gonna get selected, so I loaned him my suit. Then they call me a couple of months later, tell me, "Hey, we wanna interview you as well." So I tell my brother, "Hey, Mark, NASA called me for an interview, but you understand, you know, you gotta buy me a new suit, right, 'cause just how ridiculous would that look, me showing up in the same clothes?" But he didn't. So I have the only suit that's been selected to be an astronaut twice. Okay, Scott, the weather's great, Endeavour's ready to fly after four and a half years, so good luck, Godspeed and have some fun up there. [Scott] Well, thanks, Mike.

[Scott] It looks like the space shuttle lifts off slowly. When you're inside of it, there is nothing slow about that. It's seven million pounds of thrust instantly on your back and you feel like you can feel every pound of it. [commentator] One minute, 30 seconds into the flight. Endeavour currently traveling almost 2,000 miles an hour.

[man] As a glass artist, I'm inspired by the planets. Actually, I've always been inspired by the planets. Even when I was a kid, I loved looking up at the stars. Glass is just sand. It's part of the Earth. When it's hot, glass is alive. It has an inner light. It is a weird twist of fate that I was making planets and making space-related artwork long before Cady and I met. My name is Josh Simpson. My wife, Cady Coleman, is an astronaut. [commentator] Cady Coleman, Paolo Nespoli, and Dmitri Kondratyev head toward the International Space Station. Soyuz lighting up the night sky there at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It's a good pitch program according to flight controllers. [Cady] Thrusters are stable. [commentator] The Soyuz is delivering 102 tons of thrust from its four boosters and single engine. The first stage of the Soyuz measures 68 feet in length and 24 feet in diameter. It is burning liquid fuel for the first two minutes and six seconds of the flight. [Josh] There's this burst of light and this rocket just lifts majestically up into the air. As it goes higher up into the sky, the light gets brighter, until it diminishes and just becomes this little, bright pinpoint of light. It's amazing to think that someone that you love is that pinpoint of light. [commentator] A live view inside the Soyuz. Paolo Nespoli there on the right-hand side. Dmitri Kondratyev there in the middle seat. He is the commander of the spacecraft. And on the left-hand side's Cady Coleman. [Cady] Parameters of the launch vehicle are normal. Okay, copy. Everything is normal on board. 150 seconds. I'm Cady Coleman. I'm an astronaut who lived on the space station for almost six months. My dad worked on the Sealab program, where men first lived under the sea, and I think it became normal to me that it just was part of life, that people would live in places that not many people lived. The bottom of the ocean was part of our world, we just hadn't been there yet. I loved being underwater and having it be effortless, where you could breathe and you could see, and I felt like I was in somebody else's world and I got to explore it. One of my favorite places on the space station is our cupola. It is amazing up here. Windows on all sides. When I found out that I got accepted as an astronaut, I had been dating a really nice guy who lived in Western Massachusetts that I had met by basically calling a wrong phone number. One night, the phone rang and I answered the phone, and I said, [in Russian accent] "Hello. What do you want?" And this perfectly nice woman said, "Is this Peter?" And I said, "No, this is not Peter. My name is Olga Isnitchko Eavorskayagoopdamehamatalliaihgatana." And she said, "I'm so sorry. I thought you were Peter Masters. I'm looking for his wife, Amy." And when she said that, I knew who she was looking for, because Amy had worked in my studio years before. And so I said, "Well, if you want to find Amy, you have to look in the telephone directory, but when you get Amy on the phone, you must say hello from Olga Isnitchko Eavorskayagoopdamehamatalliaihga." She was so polite, and I just kept pulling her leg. And so I made her practice this name over and over and over again, and she finally got it, and I hung up. But when she got her friend Amy on the phone, she said, "There's this really weird man at the place where you worked, you used to work." And Amy just cracked up and said, "That's Josh. He disguises his voice at night. He hates… He doesn't wanna get an answering machine." And so Cady decided to call me back. And so she called me back with a Russian accent, and she said she was from Russian KGB and there had been numerous reports of glass-breaking. And I said, "I'm not Russian. I'm Bulgarian." And she said, "We do them too, and you're history." When we met, it was obvious to me that we should be together. It took her a long time to come around to that viewpoint. When you tell people that you live in Houston and your boyfriend lives in Western Massachusetts, they look at you, like, "Well, that's gonna last." And so we invented a new word which was "sweetheart," which seemed somehow more long-term. But I was really glad that I sort of already knew the person I was gonna spend the rest of my life with. Before I applied, before, there was sort of this aspect of this job that's hard for people to get their arms around. "What does it mean? What does it mean for her? What does it mean for me? What's our life gonna be like?" It was really nice to have already met somebody that already seemed to love all those things about me. [Josh] When Cady was accepted as an astronaut, the first thing that happened was that you have to show up to work at Johnson Space Center in Houston. And so when Jamey was born, we knew that either Jamey was going to have to travel, or, because I have a glass studio here, it turned out that I became the prime parent and Cady would travel, and I've always understood that I'm gonna be the prime parent. When Cady got first assigned even to her first mission, I was pretty worried about what was gonna happen to her, whether she was gonna be safe, whether it was gonna be okay, until I was kind of an emotional wreck. But then it occurred to me that there are literally thousands of people who are concerned with her safety and well-being, and nothing that I'm doing, nothing, no amount of worry, no amount of stress on my part was gonna help one way or the other. And I also thought about the fact that Cady took this job because, well, she wanted to do that kind of exploration, she also knew full well the dangers involved. And she's completely… I don't think she wants to die, but I think she's willing to make that sacrifice if that's the way it works. And I just thought, "Well, if my sweetheart is willing to do that, then I should just let go there." It's gonna fine, or it's not gonna be fine, but nothing that I'm gonna do or say is gonna make any difference. And that works right until you get to the, "Ten, nine, eight…" And then, of course, all of that's out the window. You're completely… There's just this flow of worry and pride and frightened emotion, and then the rocket goes off and about eight minutes later, they're in space. Bye, Cady. [interviewer] Josh, Cady's ticket to ride is behind you here on the launch pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Your thoughts as you saw this whole process. Amazing for you? [Josh] Just a whole cascade of thoughts, really, that this is, for Cady, the culmination of a dream, a lifetime of preparation. This is the spot where Yuri Gagarin left from and where Sputnik left from, and where my sweetheart is going to go. It's very significant. I think she's ready, although, knowing my wife, she'll be packing right to the last instant before she goes on board. The morning that she took off, we woke up in the middle of the night, it must have been 2:00 in the morning, and we drove to the launch site. It was really cold. We were a mile away, but it was just sort of a cement platform where we viewed the launch, and it was so cold that no amount of clothing helped. The cold just cut right through you. [commentator] Here on the ground in Baikonur, a crowd of family and friends and NASA officials, as well as Roscosmos officials, are watching tonight's launch less than a mile away from the Soyuz itself. It was really challenging for Jamey at launch because I think that sudden, "I understand what Dad's been talking about all this time. That's a rocket. That's my mom. She's gone." And there was a flood of emotion for him, and, for me, I was concerned about him as much as I was concerned for Cady. And I realize that he was turning to me and was kind of hanging on to me and he was in tears. Watching it go up was profound for Jamey. I think he realized that… his mom was really gone. [man] Cady Coleman blasted out last week on board the Soyuz rocket out of Russia, leaving behind her husband and ten-year-old son for six months' time. John, I know that you've been anxious to talk to Cady up there in space, so why don't you go first? [John] Cady, to you, are you getting settled in? You got the toothbrush put away and the socks in the sock drawer? You know, I've gotten so I feel actually right at home here, I think it's just like any other place, and then sometimes there's things that remind me that we're in space. Like this. - You know, you… - Take it. It's another one of those bad-hair days for Cady up in space. [Jamey] I remember, like, saying goodbye to my mom, like, seeing her walk out of the sort of prep facility. And I was, like, "Okay, like, this is it," you know. And I hadn't started crying quite then, but then when I saw the rocket ascending into the sky, I was, like, "Wow, my mom isn't here." It really brought me to tears 'cause it was just, like, "Wow, my mom isn't on the planet anymore." My name is Koichi Wakata. I'm a JAXA astronaut. I flew in space four times. I went to the International Space Station three times. I was born and grew up in the north of Tokyo. When I was five years old, I had a strong longing for flying in space when I saw the Apollo lunar landing. At the time, there were no Japanese astronauts, so, even for a small boy, it seemed like an unreachable goal. [robot in Japanese] Hello, Mr. Wakata. [in Japanese] Pleased to meet you, first talking robot in space. [in Japanese] Pleased to meet you, first Japanese commander of the ISS. [Koichi in English] When we go to deep space, like to Mars, it takes 20 minutes for the conversation to go through the distance between the Earth and Mars, and so the real-time conversation is not going to happen. I think this kind of AI buddy may be very helpful for your psychological boost. The space station is a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit. The purpose of the space station is to serve as a laboratory, and it's an outpost to utilize the unique environment of micro-gravity, zero gravity, basically, in order to conduct a variety of experiments in science and technology that can benefit the lives of many people around the world. We have only six crew members usually. Each one of the crew members is tasked to lead a certain part of the work on board the space station. Of course, we all have to be able to function in case of an emergency. We have to have a basic understanding of the operational skills of the systems on board. A one-week, two-week flight can pass really quickly, but I noticed that after you spend more than a month, I felt sort of like a difference. It's not like a business trip anymore. It's like I'm living in a new home away from home. Change up. Here we go. Of course, I truly enjoyed my camaraderie with my crewmates. That part is great. - It looks good. Thank you. - All right, sure. But it was tough to be separated from the family for many months. How's it going? How was school? - Pretty good. - Pretty good? All right, well, I'm gonna let you go. Is that right? Okay. All right, I'll look for it. - Yeah. - Love you. Bye. [sirens wail] [horn blares] Do not be going in there, bro. Get out! The top floor's collapsed down. I saw it blow and then ran like hell. [indistinct conversations over radio] [man] Hey, Steve, how's it going? [Steve] Well, Frank, we're not having a very good day down here on Earth. [Frank] We had no live newscast or active internet. We had to rely on the ground to tell us what was going on in those early days. I called the ground, and he began to describe the aircraft crashing into the World Trade Center. Shortly before I called, the Pentagon had been hit. And then while we were talking, the plane had crashed in Pennsylvania, and he told me about that. It was clear to me we were under attack. I looked at the map of the world that we keep up on one of the laptops, and I realized that we were crossing Canada and that we would be right over New York, and I realized we were gonna be over New England in a few seconds. So I signed off, raced around, found a video camera and a window facing in the right direction, and as we crossed Maine, I could look back on New York City. And of course the whole US was clear of clouds that day, it was a gorgeous day, and I could clearly see a big column of smoke rising out of Manhattan, out over Long Island and over the Atlantic. And I zoomed in with the video camera, and as I did, this big, grey cloud enveloped southern Manhattan. It turned out later what I was seeing was the second tower collapse. I told the guys, "90 minutes from now, when we come back over the US, I want every camera we've got pointed at the ground." As we went over Maine, we could see New York City and the smoke from the fires. Our prayers and thoughts go out to all the people there and everywhere else here. I'm looking up and down the east coast to see if I can see anything else. [woman] Frank, that's an accurate assessment. [Frank] All the contrails which normally cover the country in a spider web had disappeared, because they had grounded all the airplanes. That really brought it home that this was a totally different world now. They had had to evacuate the federal facility where our mission control was and move them to an undisclosed location, which I still don't know where it was. So we were operating with Moscow primarily, and they were very supportive, sympathetic, and trying to give us as much information as they could. Whenever one of their specials would come on to talk to us about a system or an experiment or whatever, they would frequently say, "Where's Frank?", you know, "How's Frank doing?" It was very meaningful, 'cause I knew them all by name, and they would express their condolences and they were really sorry for what happened. Interesting thing is, 94 Russians also died in the World Trade Center, and we had no idea, at that time, how many from overseas were there and lost their lives. The next day, I got a call from TJ Creamer, who was my support astronaut on the ground, and he said, "Frank, I've got some bad news." And it turned out that my classmate from the Naval Academy, who was classmates with Shep and myself, was the captain of American Airlines Flight 77 that was crashed into the Pentagon. Chic was an F-4 pilot, like me, he was an aerospace engineer, we had actually played in the drum and bugle corps together for a while, so we were friends. And so he had died in that crash. I could only imagine what it was like for him. I didn't find out much until after I returned about what the particulars were of that flight, but I felt sure he had fought as much as he could. It really brought it home to me and it made it very personal at that point. I would like to send a message from the station down in memory of Chic and of all of our graduates who perished and of all the victims of this tragedy, something that has never been done before from space. So I'd like to ask all of you to rise for a moment of silence as we play something from International Space Station Alpha. [plays "Last Post" on bugle] September 12th, 2001, 1934 hours. One day after the attacks of 9/11. Well, obviously the world changed today. What I say or do is very minor compared to the significance of what happened to our country. The most overwhelming feeling, being where I am, is one of isolation. It's difficult to describe how it feels to be the only American completely off the planet at a time such as this. The feeling that I should be there with all of you, dealing with this, helping in some way, is overwhelming. It's horrible to see smoke pouring from wounds in your own country from such a fantastic vantage point. The dichotomy of being on a spacecraft dedicated to improving life on the Earth and watching life being destroyed by such willful, terrible acts is jolting to the psyche, no matter who you are. And the knowledge that everything will be different than when we launched by the time we land is a little disconcerting. I miss all of you very much. I can't be with you there in person, and we have a long way to go to complete our mission, but be certain that my heart is with you and know you are in my prayers. Humbly, Frank. [woman] I grew up in a tiny little village in the Italian Alps called Malé. Two thousand souls. Growing up, I had the fortune of having this beautiful starry sky at night, you know. It was just this very personal connection to the sky. This dream of flying to space, become an astronaut, I think it arose out of a combination of things, and it's very difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes you fancy things in this world of childhood. [children laugh] I'm Samantha Cristoforetti and I'm an astronaut with the European Space Agency. We had started out with over 8,000 applicants, and then here we were, after a year, only ten of us. Ten young Europeans from different countries. At that point, we were almost all in touch. There was going to be a press conference, and the European Space Agency was going to announce, "Here are our new astronauts." And two days before that, at nine o'clock at night, we still had not heard. I mean, my level of tension was way up there. I just felt that I couldn't take it anymore. And then all of a sudden, there was this email, and it's like, "Dear Miss Cristoforetti…" You just felt like the universe had stopped and it turned back and smiled at me at that time. The fact that you are selected as an astronaut is huge, you know. You're not any more one of the thousands, ten thousands, maybe millions of people who dream of becoming astronauts. You actually are selected to train as an astronaut. But then this new phase of your life comes when you're just waiting and hoping that this moment is going to come and is going to come soon. One of the greatest memories I have from the time leading up to my space flight is being in Baikonur. That's where we launched from. And you go to Baikonur twice. You go to Baikonur before your own launch, and you go to Baikonur six months before, when you are actually the back-up crew. So, you are, in theory, ready to fly instead of the prime crew if the prime crew has an issue. And we were down there, Terry, Anton and myself, in May 2014, as the back-up crew, and that was the most wonderful time. We are usually allowed to go out and have a jog with other people who are in quarantine with us. We kind of bend the rules because we'd just go out without any escort. And basically what I wanted to do, I had a bottle with me, and I had put in a picture of the three of us. We had signed thousands of those pictures in the days before, and so I had grabbed one with our signature, and I had added an email address that I had just done for that purpose. And I thought, "We'll just throw it in the river and then maybe some mysterious inhabitant of the steppe one day will write back to us." We are about to come back and we realize a little bit upstream there are, like, these wild horses, such a beautiful image. There were probably, maybe 20, 30 of those, and they had come, there were no people, just the wild horses, and they had come to drink at the river. And it was such a beautiful, powerful scene, you know. And for me it was just something that brought me into the emotional mood of then watching the launch in the night. [man] And lift-off. The international crew on their way to the International Space Station. Right now, looking good. First stage performance. The Soyuz delivering 930,000 pounds of thrust. That's four boosters and single core and engine. [continues indistinctly] We like to say in the space business, you don't know that you're going to space until, you know, that rocket that you're sitting on is actually taking off. [commentator] TMA-15M. Three new crew members headed to the International Space Station, Anton Shkaplerov, Samantha Cristoforetti and Terry Virts, on their way to a six-month voyage aboard the International Space Station. ["Bright Horses" playing] ♪ The bright horses have broken free From the fields ♪ [commentator] A minute, ten seconds into flight, traveling about 1,100 miles per hour. ♪ They are horses of love Their manes full of fire ♪ ♪ They are parting the cities Those bright burning horses ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ [Samantha] When you're sitting inside the Soyuz, and you're approaching Space Station, you do not really see it. What you see is like a black and white image on the camera. I mean, there's windows to the sides, but you basically will not see Space Station as you approach. And that was my case. However, when you get to around 40, 50 meters out, if you look out to the side, you will start to catch a glimpse of it. And here are like the solar panels of the ISS, of the space station, which are just gigantic, which, of course, I know in my mind how big they are, but I've never actually seen them, so, you know, this huge size. But then, on top of that, at that moment of transition, and it's just really a few seconds between daylight and night, the sun is basically lying very low on the horizon and it's just this spot of orange, and the light that comes in that moment is this very bright orange light. It's so overwhelming. I had this feeling they were, like, burning, they were like in flames. [Samantha gasps] Oh, my God. [man speaks in Russian] I'm going, "Oh, my God, oh, my God." And then of course you hear Anton, my commander, he's going like [speaks Russian] which means, "Be quiet, be quiet." Whatever I say is heard on the Earth, you know, all the control centers. It's not my proudest moment from a professional point of view. On the other hand, I'm also very happy that it happened at that moment because it made it so special, the arrival to Space Station. [man speaks in Russian] [woman speaks in Russian] [applause] [Samantha] Actually, the moment when we opened the hatch and I floated into Space Station, that was a moment of sheer happiness. You open the hatch, there's people out there waiting for you who are welcoming you into this new place and this new life, and in a way it felt like a new birth, you know, and it was incredibly, incredibly intense. It's the end of all that preparation and that initial journey, and it's the beginning of this experience that I had looked forward to for so long. If you imagine our view, from the space station, of the planet as a show that planet Earth puts on scene for us, it's mute, it has no sound. It's just an incredibly powerful visual spectacle. Just an incredibly beautiful view when it's alive because it changes all the time and there's always something new to discover. [man] Columbia-Houston, comm check. Columbia-Houston, UHF comm check.

Flight controllers are continuing to stand by to regain communications with the spacecraft. - [man 3] Flight decks. - [man] Go ahead, Max. [man 3] FYI, I've just lost four separate temperature transducers on the left side of the vehicle, the hydraulic return temperatures. We've also lost the nose-gear down talkback and the right main-gear down talkback. [man] Columbia-Houston, comm check. CC flight. CC flight. - [man 3] What did you say? - Lock the doors. [man 3] Copy. My name is Ken Bowersox. I was the commander on Expedition 6. [man on radio] Astronaut John Glenn of New Concord, Ohio. Lieutenant-Colonel, United States… [Ken] I decided I wanted to be an astronaut when I was about seven. I was in a car with my dad, and on the radio there was a story about John Glenn orbiting the Earth. And I asked my dad what that meant, and he told me, and I said, "Oh, I think that's what I wanna do when I grow up." [commentator] Our first view of Ken Bowersox outside the hatch to the Quest Airlock as the International Space Station skirts just to the east of Rio de Janeiro. ♪ Wherever you're going, I'm going ♪ ♪ I'm going your way ♪ [Ken] Every Saturday morning was clean-up time, where we'd grab towels, wipe down the handrails and vacuum. We had a Saturday morning teleconference scheduled. We went in to start the teleconference and the folks in Mission Control asked us to just stand by. It was usual that, because it was Saturday morning, the folks in Houston wanted to get that teleconference over as quickly as possible 'cause some people wanted to go home, right? So for them to ask us to wait was a little bit different. The center director of Johnson Space Center came on and told us that Columbia had been lost on entry. There was a lot of different meanings to that for us. The first was, "Well, what's happened to our friends who are on Columbia?" 'Cause we knew those folks, we worked with them in the office, would fly with them in the T-38s, sat in meetings with them, talked to them in the hallways. So the first thing was, "What's happened to them?" you know. Is there any chance that they made it through? Folks on the ground have been real good about reducing our schedule and we've had time to grieve our friends. And that was very important. When you're up here this long, you can't just bottle up your emotions and focus all the time. It's important for us to acknowledge that the people on STS-107 were our friends, that we had a connection with them, and that we feel their loss. The next impact to us was, "Well, what does that mean for us to come home?" Since the space shuttles were under review, we had to decide when it would be safe to fly one again and how to fly it safely. The decision was made for us to come home a different way, to come home in a Soyuz spacecraft. So we're packing up gear to be returned home aboard shuttles when they start flying again. We'll have some refresher training to do over the next month and a half or so. My family spent most of their time worrying about the people that were affected on the ground, the effect on the spouses for the crew of Columbia. But they also had a lot of inquiries from different people wanting to know how they felt with their husbands up in space, knowing that it was a risky business. Everybody wanted to know what we thought about the risk. Let me start by sort of comparing what a Soyuz flight is like compared to a return in a space shuttle. The space shuttle is a lot more like flying on an airliner, and the return from space is very similar to flying on an airliner, except you go from being weightless to having your perceived weight be maybe one and a half times your normal weight. And then the final approach is like a steep glide in an airliner and you touch down on a runway. It feels very much like any touchdown from an international flight. On a Soyuz, you get in, it's smaller, everything is more compact. Instead of sitting up, like you would on an airliner, you're kind of laying on your back, and it's a much quicker trip home. It's only a few hours back to Earth rather than a day and a half or two in a space shuttle. It's a little bit more like a carnival ride. [man] And Expedition 6 now officially on its way back home, with landing a little more than three hours from now. [Ken] The flight gets most interesting when you start to get down into the atmosphere. First thing you see is some glowing light coming off the side of the capsule and any other parts around it. You see a bright orange glow outside the windows. You might see little droplets running along the window that look like water but are really something melted on the spacecraft. [man] At this point, the crew should be feeling the maximum G-load on the re-entry. [man speaks in Russian] We realized that we were having an off-nominal type of entry called a ballistic descent. Once you reach the ballistic descent mode, there's not a lot for the crew to interact with on the spacecraft, and so you have some spare moments to think about what you're doing and to realize how little control you have over the situation, how you're trusting the engineers who designed and the technicians who built that spacecraft, and how everything's gotta work if you're gonna survive. I'm in the helicopter with the chief of the astronaut office, Bob Cabana, and they say, "We're in touch with the crew. We're hearing the crew." But it was a very faint call. I could tell my boss was really, really worried. He said, "Why is the signal faint? Can they hear them?" I said, "They can't hear them. They heard them on the radio and then it disappeared." Bob Cabana was like, "Oh, no, we've lost another crew." They said, "They did a ballistic entry." To mean they're 400 kilometers away, off-course, and not in the right place, not where we are. When the parachutes come out, you get rocked all around, shaken, rotated. It feels pretty violent. Again, that's where it feels most like a carnival ride. And then it gets peaceful, and you coast and coast and coast down underneath the parachutes. There's sort of a big bang as you hit the ground. It feels like a car collision. The vehicle gets drug a little bit by the parachute if you have any wind, and that jostles the crew around a bit, and then everything gets quiet. Absolutely quiet. You start to smell the smoke from the rockets. You smell the grass outside. You look out the window and you can see the brown of the dirt and the green of the grass, and you know you're back on Earth. We sat there trying to talk to people on the radio, and we weren't able to reach anybody. After being there about 30 minutes, we decided we should get out, and Nikolai reached up and opened the hatch and crawled out of the spacecraft, and I followed him after that, and Don came third. [Mike] We finally get there after six hours to the landing site. I see Ken and Nikolai and Don sitting outside of the Soyuz. There are little yellow buttercups and daisies out there, and it's just rolling plains. I think there are wild horses out there on that plain. I said, "Well, how are you feeling?" "We feel really tired, really weak." I said, "What were the G's you had during the entry?" "Eight G's!" I said, "Really?" So we kind of get them into the helicopter. And Don wants to lie down. So he's lying down on the floor. There's not much room. Ken's kind of propped up against a fuel tank in this helicopter, no straps, nothing like that. And he says, "Don't forget that." I go, "What?" He says, "That big sack." He said, "We didn't know if we were ever gonna get our stuff back. So we've got all of Don's films and camera magazines." And I picked it up and it was like 30, 40 pounds, you know, 20 kilos. I said, "How did you put this in the Soyuz?" And Ken said, "Don had it on his lap." Eight G's. Eight gravities. Multiply that times 20 kilos, that's 160 kilos on Don's chest. I said, "You've had a… How could you have put that on Don's chest?" So, anyway, poor Don was kind of looking a bit worse for wear from that journey back to Earth. [groans] I wave to the camera. [Ken] We knew it was coming, and so we were prepared for the G's. In fact, at the point where we saw it coming, we said, "Okay, guys, let's get strapped down in your seats, 'cause it's about to get fun, fast." In fact, Nikolai was great. He says, "This is gonna be fun." - He was great. - Nikolai said that? He was like a cheerleader all the way down, and we're all straining against the G. [grunts] It was… quite an experience. [laughter] It's great that we had a chance to ride in a vehicle that was on its first flight into the atmosphere. And so I feel really lucky. - [interviewer] Well, there we are. - That's two. [interviewer laughs] Annie Bowersox. Annie, it's a great day. The crew is home safe and sound. Very successful landing. How does Ken look? How excited is he to be back? He looks great. He looks exactly the same as when he left, maybe a little thinner. And when I first saw him, it was like the six months had just gone away. He's eager to see our kids when we get back to Houston and we're really excited about that. The boys are dying to see him. What do you consider to be the most important contribution, legacy, the living history, of Expedition 6? What do you think it will be most remembered for? I think their flight showed what an incredible team NASA has become with their partners. So much of this flight was not as planned, and it's just amazing and it just clicked. It's a great team. ["The Star-Spangled Banner" plays] [Barack Obama] Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars. And in two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. So, good luck, Captain. Make sure to Instagram it. We're proud of you. [Scott] I thought, you know, spending a year in space is gonna be really challenging psychologically and emotionally. Eventually, I warmed up to the idea. They had a selection process and an interview. It was interesting, the very last question was, "So, if you could get the year-long space mission or you could be the chief of the astronaut office, which would you prefer?" And I said immediately, I said, "Chief of the astronaut office." And, like, two weeks later somebody else got that job, and I got assigned to this year-long flight. From the time you leave the United States for a Russian Soyuz launch, it's this whole process of different traditions. You have to visit the Kremlin. You have to go to pay respects to the cosmonauts in the Russian and Soviet space program. You had to look at the bell and the cannon, because previous crew members have done that. And then, a couple weeks before, you fly down to Baikonur and you go through similar kind of traditions and preparations. It's a, you know, iconic place. [applause] [woman] Hey, Scott, I know you have a brother and you are twins. Is it really difficult not to see each other for one year? [Scott] No, it's not. [laughter] [woman] Thank you. [Scott] Heading to the launch pad, the van stops in the same spot that Yuri Gagarin stopped and got out and peed on the tire. So we have to get out, undo our spacesuit, pee on the tire, get back in, button your spacesuit up, and keep heading to the rocket. You always get a blessing from a Russian Orthodox priest, which is generally pretty cold water in your face. 'Cause they're not your superstitions and traditions, they seem a little bit odd, but, yeah, one of their big cultural things is if their friends are going on a trip, then they have to be there to say goodbye, even if that's at a base of a fully fueled rocket. There's like a hundred people up there and you're just trying to get through this crowd. It's like madness. Crazy. It's like a big party at the base of the rocket. There's smokers out there. I've seen them. Yeah. When you're in the Soyuz, there's some dead time where you don't have much to do. So to help you pass the time, the control center will pipe music into the capsule. So the crew picks out some songs. I had a Bruce Springsteen song and a Coldplay song. I can tell you, I didn't pick Roberta Flack, "Killing Me Softly." One of the cosmonauts did. I like the song, it's a really, really good song, but it doesn't seem quite appropriate to have it playing when you're sitting on basically a bomb of liquid oxygen and liquid kerosene that's designed to explode underneath you. ["Killing Me Softly" playing] ♪ Strumming my pain with his fingers ♪ ♪ Singing my life with his words ♪ ♪ Killing me softly with his song ♪ ♪ Killing me softly with his song ♪ ♪ Telling my whole life with his words ♪ ♪ Killing me softly ♪ ♪ With his song ♪ [Scott] One of my kids, I think it was, yeah, my youngest, when I said, "I'm going to the year-long mission," the reaction I got was, like, "That's awesome!" And when Misha called his wife and said that he was gonna go to space for a year, she started crying. [chuckles] So my family was excited. Maybe that says something about me. They were, like, excited to get rid of me for a year. "Can you go for two?" [chuckles] I previously had six months in space, and I can remember six months being a really long time to be anywhere where you can't go home, and you're floating, and, you know, there's just a level of uncomfortableness about being in space for a long time. But like most things, as you get further away from them, you remember the great things about it and you forget the hardship or the stuff that's hard. [commentator] Scott Kelly, Mikhail Kornienko, and Gennady Padalka, the all-time record holder for time in space among all of humanity, launching flawlessly and arriving just six hours later. They made their way in and were welcomed by the current Expedition 43 crew on board, Terry Virts, Samantha Cristoforetti and Anton Shkaplerov, who are already several months into their mission. But for Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko, the first steps into the space station and their home for the next 340 days. [Scott] You miss, you know, your friends, your family, people on the ground. You miss the weather. I always missed rain, the sound of it. But you miss things like that, the sun, miss going outside. See, we got some creamed spinach, asparagus and grilled chicken. It's gonna go on a tortilla. My spoon. Can't let the little droplets get too far. Surface tension is very important. If we didn't have surface tension in space, we'd be in big trouble in a lot of areas. Yeah. Oh! Oh, man. That was just made by a chef. - Yep. - And it is best before July 2016. This is probably best before July 2013. [both laugh] You could actually keep in touch pretty well. We have a phone on board. Generally, you can have a video conference on the weekends, so you get to see your family. It's pretty good capability, actually. You just can't see people in person. Hi, Dad. How are you doing? - [Scott] I'm doing good. - Yeah? - Got some visitors showing up tomorrow. - Awesome. Have you gotten your Christmas presents yet? Yeah, thank you for the T-shirt. I think I put, like, a bell in there that was like, "Number One Dad." - Got the bell and the card too, yeah. - Yeah. - And the T-shirt was in there too. - Yeah. - All right, love you, Charlotte. - Love you too. Talk to you then. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. I got Misha behind me. Waking up too. A lot of people don't realize this, but when we're sitting here, and we're looking at each other, you're looking at me, I'm looking at you, what you see is filtered by the air we're looking through. When you're in space, and the only air you're looking through is between your eye and the visor, or maybe between your eye and the window, it makes everything look just spectacularly, brilliantly colored and clear, because you're looking through nothing, there's nothing to filter your eye, whether it's looking at the Earth or looking at the space station. And when you're outside, I mean, it's just incredible. Incredible. Oh! Man, that feels good. [woman] Welcome home. Ah. [woman] Back to Earth. [ringing tone] [Nigel] You've reached the voicemail for Angela and Nigel Peake, but I'm afraid we're not here just at the moment. Please leave us a message. We'll get back to you as soon as we can. Thank you very much. [bleeps] [Tim Peake] Hello, Angela and Nigel Peake. This is just your son calling from the International Space Station. I'm sorry you're not in, but I will try and get you later.

I grew up in Westbourne, which is a small village in West Sussex. We had beautiful night skies. I would, you know, often go out at night and just look up at the stars, and really ask myself the big questions about our place in the universe and how we got here, and what created the universe, and where it's going. The ability to actually go up there and travel, to see what's out there beyond the boundaries, was definitely a dream. - [Tim] Okay, I'm coming out. - [Tim Kopra] Okay. [Reid Wiseman] Hey, Tim, it's really cool seeing that Union Jack go outside, since it's explored all over the world, now it's explored space. [Tim] It's great to be wearing it. A huge privilege. A proud moment. [man] Gentlemen, looking great. Glad to see you both out there together on the tip of the world. [Tim] We thought it very important to include our children in everything that was going on, so they felt very much a part of that process. [boy] Hello, Daddy. They were there in Kazakhstan on launch day. [reporter] Tim's wife, Rebecca, beaming with pride. Not a trace of nerves. Will you ever be able to look at the stars in the same way again? It'll give us something extra to look at, that's for sure, now that we know Daddy's up there, so, yeah, we'll have something else to look out for in the night sky, so it'll be great. [Tim] I got to see them just before getting onto the bus as well, to the launch pad. By the time you actually say goodbye to your family and go to the launch pad, there's a moment there where you realize, "Okay, this is happening now." And for me, it was a real flick of a switch in terms of mental focus. Ten, nine, eight… [Tim] You realize, "This is it for six months. Get into the right frame of mind, because what you're going to do is quite remarkable." One! Hey! Bye, Daddy! Bye! [Tim] Nothing can really prepare you for that feeling of weightlessness and how to move your body around. You feel very clumsy at first. Your arms and legs are not moving how you would expect them to, and you have to use your muscles in a different way to control yourself. This could be the worst idea I've ever had. - [laughs] - Come on. You can do better than that. Okay, so, yeah, I'll just go into a ball and start spinning, and then if you wanna just keep me going round, and… - Shall I keep you on axis too? - Yeah, yeah. On axis, that's cool. Let's go for it. That's good. That's really fast from my point of view, but it's not making me feel sick. The space station is, first and foremost, a scientific laboratory. When you change gravity, you get some quite remarkable results in many of the experiments that we're doing. If you think that all life on Earth has evolved over billions of years in a one-G environment, put them into weightlessness, we know straightaway that the human body changes remarkably just in the first five weeks in space. Our immune system changes, our cardiovascular system changes, our blood volume changes, our skin ages differently, our eyesight changes. And that just goes to show what gravity is doing here on Earth and what happens when you remove it. Okay, I'll see if I can… I'm feeling dizzy. I'll see how quickly it stops. So definitely felt dizzy initially, and now it's gone. - No. It's that quick? - Yeah. Yeah, completely normal. - Amazing. - Yeah. [man] Crazy. [Tim] I was very lucky to have the opportunity to go on a spacewalk. Myself and Tim Kopra, my NASA crewmate. We had to go and repair one of the solar panels. It was quite an important task to get the full power back up and running to the space station. [commentator] Tim Peake now being moved by Scott Kelly on the left, Sergei Volkov on the right, into the crew-lock section of Quest. [Tim] When you first go into the airlock, you're in there with so much other equipment. Everything is making an awful noise. I mean, we have a lot of metal on our spacesuits, so lots of clips, lots of karabiners, tethers which are gonna keep things attached. Everything is clunking around, making a racket. As the airlock starts to depressurize and we go to vacuum, you notice a lot of that noise starting to disappear. We still hear things because they're being transmitted through our spacesuit, but, for example, you can get two metal clips in front of your helmet and knock them together and then you won't hear anything at all. The noise that you have is just a gentle hum of a fan blowing air over the back of our heads through our helmets. Dropping out of the airlock and just seeing Earth beneath my feet for the first time was wonderful. It's a very calm environment, a very serene environment. It's not like a high-adrenaline, extreme sport. It's one that's just of awe. ♪ Hanging around On the edge of the world ♪ ♪ Finally no one around ♪ [Tim] I think spacewalking is probably the highest risk activity that we do, and it's actually physically demanding as well. It looks very graceful when you see astronauts out there, but inside the suit, we're working very, very hard with moving your fingers and your arms against the pressure of a pressurized suit. ♪ Solid ground ♪ One thing that was strange for me as a pilot is that in all my years of flying, of course, if there's an emergency, one of the first things you're thinking about is landing. Where am I gonna land? How am I going to land? In space, that's not gonna happen. You're up there for good. ♪ Solid ground ♪ [Josh] Our planet is just a little blue marble floating in the black void of space. I make little planets that perhaps remind one of how small our own Earth is in relation to the greater universe. Some kind of a star-base there. And sometimes just cities. People actually give us a hard time because he makes glass planets and I like to go look for planets. They seem to like it up here. [Jamey] Hey, Mom, I made cookies. [Josh] Jamey made cookies two nights in a row. [Cady] Oh, I miss you, sweetie-pie. I love you guys a lot. I miss you. [Jamey] Love you too. I love you. I miss you. - [Josh] All right, bye, sweetie. - [Cady] Bye. We could not call Cady, but she called us. I think she called us every single night she was in orbit except the night before she came back. It was amazing to have her call us. We'd talk for a few minutes and then we'd go back, if it was a clear night, we'd walk out onto the back porch and watch her just blaze across the sky. [Jamey] She would read me, like, bedtime stories, or I would just sort of talk to her in my room about my day, you know. It was definitely really tough to not be able to talk in the same way, and that whenever I needed something, I would call my mom and be, like, "Mom, I can't find my pants. Where are my pants?" But now that she was on the station, it was, like, "Sweetie, I don't know where your pants are, because I haven't been there for four months," you know. People ask me, you know, like, "What is it like to have your mom as an astronaut?" And I'll be, like, "Well, I mean, it's just Mom." [Cady] I look out at the stars and I see so many stars and planets and know that, you know, we have a place in the universe, and it's our job to explore that place. We need to bring up our children to recognize and celebrate the differences among us and realize that it is bringing those differences to a team that allows us to pursue and succeed in large endeavors, like having it become normal that somebody's mom lives on the space station. ["In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning" playing] ♪ In the wee small hours of the morning ♪ ♪ While the whole wide world Is fast asleep ♪ It's very interesting when you overfly places that you have a strong connection to. You are high enough that you can embrace with one look an entire country. Like Italy, you can easily see the whole of it. Everybody that I know that I love that lives in there, I can kind of see them all. We are flying around the Earth once every 90 minutes. Every orbit is like this embrace of the planet. There is no one place on the planet that feels far away. Everything feels very close, like your backyard. ♪ In the wee small hours of the morning ♪ ♪ That's the time… ♪ [Samantha] Even the strange situation of thinking that, you know, there's billions of people on the planet, and there's only six right now that are not, you know, confined to the surface, and it happens to be the six of us. I think by the end what I had was a feeling of affection for the planet as a whole. It almost makes you feel like the sentinels that are guarding the Earth, especially when you fly over it at night, right? You almost think, like, people down there, you're looking over them as they're sleeping. You get that feeling of, "Oh, gosh, you know, it's my planet, I want to protect it." ♪ In the wee small hours of the morning ♪ ♪ That's the time you miss her ♪ ♪ Most of all ♪ [Peggy] One of the best parts of being able to look at Earth from space is perspective. Because you see that planet, you see how valuable it is, how tiny-thin that atmosphere is, and that's where all of the humanity that we know about, anyway, lives on. And then you look out to the stars and you see thousands and thousands and thousands of stars, and recognize that we are just one galaxy and that there are billions of galaxies out there that have maybe even more stars than us. It makes me sure that there is other life out there. It may not look like us, or, you know, be like us in any form or fashion, but there's going to be life out there. There's just too many choices, too many chances to be had. I think what history will say about the space station is going to be that it was the first real demonstration of international cooperation. We put together pieces that had never been put together, we did it in low-Earth orbit, going 17,500 miles an hour, and that technical cooperation overcomes differences in culture, in religions or beliefs. We overcame all of that and came together to build something really special. I think one of the most memorable times on the spacewalk, I was doing a baseband signal processor change-out. I pulled the box out, and the back side of the container that housed the box was this mirror reflective substance, and I saw myself in a spacesuit with the Earth behind me. I was, like, "Hey, I'm an astronaut. The real thing!" Not bad for a girl from Iowa. I would go back to space in a heartbeat. I met my radiation limits with NASA, so I'll have to find somebody else that'll fly me. [chuckles] [Scott] Seeing the Earth from space, and seeing the planet without political borders, you get an enhanced sense that we are all in this thing that we call humanity together. You know, we're all part of the same team, Team Earth. One of the first times I looked at the Earth I was, like, kind of puzzled. I was like, "Hey, what's that thin film over the surface?" And then you quickly realize, that's our atmosphere. When you look down on the planet, our atmosphere looks like a contact lens over somebody's eyeball, like this very, very fragile thing. And then you see how certain parts of the Earth are almost always covered in pollution. Noticeable changes in the rainforest. I mean, it really makes you, you know, wanna take care of the planet. We're all not going to Mars. Mars is not the place that we go after we destroy this planet. That's not gonna work. This was built by an international partnership. Fifteen different countries, different languages, different cultures, different technical ways of doing things. This is like the hardest thing we've ever done. Maybe harder than going to the Moon. That alone proves that if we have a dream, if we have a goal, if we work together, work as a team, we can accomplish amazing things. [man speaks in Russian] [applause] [Sergei in Russian] Space exploration is important because it's a way to expand our world. The fact that we've now learned to go higher than the atmosphere is probably a step as crucial as learning to cross the sea. [man] The crew requests permission to come aboard. [man 2] Endeavour, permission granted. [Sergei in Russian] Sooner or later, we must find some settlements on the Moon, then maybe on Mars's satellites, on Mars itself, so these are the first steps to making our civilization multi-planetary. We do realize we've just started on this path and maybe walking it is slower than sci-fi writers thought 30 or 40 years ago, but we still have to take steps now to finally arrive where our destiny lies. [Bill] To us, their less tried successors, they appear magnified, pushing out into the unknown in obedience to an inward voice, to an impulse beating in the blood, to a dream of the future. They were wonderful, and it must be owned, they were ready for the wonderful. [woman] Parameters of the launch vehicle are normal. [woman 2] Okay, copy. Everything is normal on board. 150 seconds. [woman 3] Have you loud and clear. Everything is normal on board. Further inaudible. [woman 4] This is 19. Solovia. Yes, I have you loud and clear. Everything's good on our side. Congratulations.
