You Tube - Video Running Time 02:21:07 You Tube search name - Sangdil - 1952 Kamla, come here. Open your mouth. Just you wait! How many times have I told you not to talk to that bitch? She'll make you, too, worthless like herself. - Will you play with her again? - No, Ma. Trouble maker. - Have you finished? - Yes, mother. What's that? God! This girl will throw away the utensils too. Wonder what sin I'm paying for. You good-for-nothing! You dirtied the utensils again. What do you think? Clean them all again. If I see you wasting time again, I'll thrash you! I'll be rid of her only after she dies. Will you let me die in peace or not? You shut-up! This girl has become so lazy... the moment I turn my back, she starts lazing around. She has even made my Shankar like herself. You're being cruel to her for no reason. Despite being so close to death... I might not die... because I don't want to leave the innocent girl at your mercy. Talking too much will hurt you. Take your medicine and sleep. You'll have to listen to me today. She is my friend's daughter. And he'd left her in my custody, along with all his property... so that I took care of her. But along with usurping his property... you also want to kill her. How will I face my friend in the next world? I don't like speaking of death. And as if I'll take this wealth with me when I die. I'm keeping it for your son. Let's go and hear a story from the maid. - Is your ear feeling better now? - Forget that. Mom is reading the Gita for father. It's a good opportunity. Let's go! Maid! You two have come together again? If madam sees you, you won't lose anything. - This poor girl will be beaten. - She can't see us. She's reading the Gita to father. And you won't let us be beaten. Naughty! - Will you tell us a story? - Alright, sit here. Take. What story would you like to hear? - The fairy princess story. - Yes, the same. When the prince comes on horseback... Keep quiet. Let her tell the story. Alright, listen. There was a fairy queen, who had a young daughter. She was very beautiful, very sweet. Everyone loved her. She was great friends with a prince... who used to take her on his horse for long rides. When he didn't come, she would sing a song to call him. And the prince, wherever he might be, would come running. But one day, when she was sleeping in her palace... a witch came in to eat her. Away from the world, close to the clouds Let us create our own new world We will live in our own small world In which we will live with love We will make the moon our boat And bring down the stars Our world will be different from this world And our love unique Let us create our own new world Away from the world, close to the clouds Let us create our own new world With flowers in our lap We will narrate our story With the dawn will come dancing And bring along new blooms The dew will come and kiss our cheeks And the rains will pour Let us create... Away from the world, close to the clouds Let us create our own new world - Maid? - What is it? Mom has locked Kamla in the room again. She'll be afraid. Please get her out of there. She is bent on killing the poor girl. Maid, you have to go and get her out of there. Come dear, master has called you. Come close to me, dear. I had made many promises to your father. But I have been incapacitated. I wonder how I will ever face him. You aren't feeling well. Go to sleep. I want to sleep forever. But I am helpless. When you are not at peace here... how can I die in peace? Master, if you talk like that, who will she look to for support? When one has no one left, God becomes his support. Kamla, I put you in His care. Where is God's picture? Where is it? Why can't I see it? Maid, bring the picture here. Whenever I've been very upset... I have found solace at His feet. You also take solace from Him, dear. Shankar, come close to me. You are my son. You keep my word. I make you responsible for Kamla. With God as witness... promise me... you won't let your mother take Kamla's property. You witch! You've come out again! What magic spell are you casting here? Come! Leave her alone! I said leave her alone! As long as Shankar's father was alive... we somehow managed to survive. But I am alone, and a woman. And I have to take care of my son. How can I afford to feed that orphan? Don't worry, the girl will calm down in our orphanage. You won't know she even exists. - Shall I call her? - Sure. Kamla, where does man go after he dies? - To God. - God kills man. Then what does His idol do? Father used to say that keeping it close rids one of his fear. One finds solace. After father's death, I feel very scared. Then take the idol to your room. - What about you? - Just give me a flower kept at His feet. Kamla. Where were you? I've been looking for you. Look at your hair. It's disheveled. Come, I'll comb it. Go Shankar, you also go and freshen up. Greet him. I've heard you're a very naughty girl. But you'll have to straighten up from today. And be as straight a girl as this cane of mine! Come with me! - Shankar! Shankar! - Kamla! Shankar! Kamla! Don't cry, dear. What is your name, dear? Did she reveal who her relatives are? No madam, she doesn't want to go anywhere. Mention her going back, and she starts crying. I told you, she doesn't seem to belong to this world. She has come from heaven only to serve the Lord. Make her a priestess (devotee). Will you stay here with us and promise to serve the Lord? Will you lock me up here? This is God's home. No one is forced to do anything here. Will mother come here and beat me? Those who promise to serve the Lord... God Himself protects them. No one will beat you here. Kamla, before becoming a priestess... any memories you have of earthly bonds... destroy them all in this holy fire. It will destroy all your sins, and purify you. You have to surrender your clothes, your bonds, in this fire. Hail Shankar! A devotee craving the sight of You is here I light lamps before You If I gain a place at your feet, I'll find peace in life A devotee craving the sight of You is here I light lamps before you If I gain a place at your feet, I'll find peace in life You sustain the world Your lights are the moon and stars This sinner has come to Your door Please keep me at Your feet I plead with You, with my head bowed in reverence If I gain a place at Your feet, I'll find peace in life A devotee craving the sight of You is here I light lamps before You If I gain a place at Your feet, I'll find peace in life I have many flaws Help me keep my honor Help me through life Grant me this boon, oh Lord I have brought this sinful life to Your door Grant me this boon, oh Lord I plead with You, with my head bowed in reverence If I gain a place at your feet, I'll find peace in life A devotee craving the sight of You is here I light lamps before You If I gain a place at your feet, I'll find peace in life A devotee craving the sight of You is here Shankar? Who was he? - Who was he? - Kamla? Away from the world, close to the clouds Let us create our own new world Away from the world, close to the clouds Let us create our own new world - Are you very sad? - No, mother. - May I ask you something? - Yes. Even after staying in the temple for so many years... why does your mind always think of the outside world? Your feet falter many times walking the path of your duty. What is that bond you haven't been able to forget yet? Who holds the strings of your heart? Who tugs at them always? I think of no one but Shankar. I have surrendered myself at His feet. That is what I'd come to tell you. That you have become the Lord's priestess. You have no right to have anything in your heart... except the Lord's image. Stick to your oath, dear. Keep your heart pure. If it still holds any evil, any sin, any memory... throw it out of your heart. It is in your interest. Years passed. Many Springs came and went. Many storms rose, and hid in the folds of time. But he couldn't erase the memory of her from his heart. The cruelty of time had snatched the shine from his eyes. His lips smiled, but his heart would cry. Nobody was aware of the poison... that was suppressed in that handsome body. Many women came into his life. They fell for his money, and his woeful face. }And he would secretly laugh at them. He was taking revenge on the entire world. - Then what happened? - We'll know when we continue. It is always easier when no one knows. Knowing something is also a burden. Shankar, you like this flower very much, don't you? Then put it in my hair. Come on! Mohini, how will one flower help? Ask for diamonds and pearls. You can loot everything. - What have I looted from anyone? - Ask me that. Except for this one flower, you have taken everything I had. What you say is so fascinating. Your eyes are so mesmerizing. And even my estate is beautiful. It is full of silver fields and gold jungles. You always confuse me with what you say. - You are very bad. - Thank you. - What are you doing here? - When did you trap this new bird? What you're doing isn't right. - Better leave! - Yes, I'm leaving. - Meet you at the estate. - Don't go there, I'm warning you! Why not? What will you do? Kill me? What's the matter? What's the matter? I'll have to go to my estate for some days. So, why are you worried? Take me along. I'll get a chance to see your estate. - Will you come along? - We'll take along some friends, too. It'll be a nice picnic. This full moon, we will have to attend the festival in Kamalpur. What festival, mother? Every year, after harvest, the farmers there... worship the Goddess. We received an invitation this year. - When do we leave? - On the 13th day. - Hail Shankar! - Welcome. How are you? By the Lord's grace, we are fine. She is Thakur's (landlord's) Mother. Greet her, dear. Thakur's mother? Greetings, mother. It's strange! Seeing the Thakur's mother... I felt she was my old maid. She has the same face! Don't say that, dear. She is Thakur's mother. If anyone hears you, what will they say? There can be two people with similar faces. Besides, your maid's face would change over the years. God knows whether she is alive or not. What are you looking at? Those flowers are so beautiful. You are sad again. You've been reminded of some past memory. No mother. Past days and separated friends... don't return just by thinking of them. And what will I gain thinking about them? I was just admiring the lovely sights. The flower beds are so beautiful. If you permit me, may I take a stroll in the garden? Of course, child. Away from the world, close to the clouds Let us create our own new world Who are you? Have I reached heaven? No. Your horse stumbled. You wanted to pluck this flower. Where is the flower? - I wanted to pluck the flower, but fell down. - Why? Any beautiful flower I see, I pluck it. Even you are very beautiful. Why stare at me like that? Do you know me? I feel I've seen you before. Where have you seen me? You must have heard about my riches. You misunderstand me. Who are you? A priestess. If you're a priestess, go to the temple and worship God. You'll only benefit there. What can you accomplish roaming the jungle? How are you, Mohini? My eyes were craving to see you. Do you like this place? I feel like never leaving this place. Who's asking you to leave? Ask my heart. Every heart beat says you must stay here forever. You are a thorough liar! You have no place for me in your heart. If not in my heart, there's a place in this house. Thakur has come suddenly, and we have many guests. Their stay is being arranged in the rooms below. Would you mind if I gave you a room upstairs? Come. This wind, this night, this moonlight All I crave is for one look from you How can I not yearn for you? My passion for you brings joy to my heart This wind, this night, this moonlight Do you know, oh naive one... what one look from you does to me? If it's an angry look, it can make hell break loose And a loving look gives solace How can I not yearn for you? Your every word fascinates me This wind, this night, this moonlight There is none more beautiful than you There is excitement in the air All due to the magic of your eyes How can I not yearn for you? My passion for you brings joy to my heart This wind, this night, this moonlight All I crave is for one look from you She is Thakur's mother. Greet her, dear. I wanted to pluck a flower, and fell down. Even you are beautiful. - What's going on upstairs? - You? Over here? The screams are scaring me. Who's upstairs? - The spirit of a witch. - Spirit? There's a spirit here? It's in the room upstairs. It doesn't come down, don't worry. Then why has Thakur gone upstairs? Unless he goes upstairs for the witch to see him... she doesn't stop screaming and shouting. Don't go upstairs. Who's she? - She's a priestess. - What's she doing here? I wonder where these priestess's come from. Is this a home or a temple? What will you gain by breaking these lifeless statues? My life is broken. I will break everything. That won't give you peace of mind. Peace is not in my destiny. Your roaming from city to city distresses you all the more. I don't roam. I try to escape death. If I stay here, she'll suck me dry one day. Forget that. I get wounded every day. For how long will you treat the wounds? May I come in? Come. What is the matter? You hesitate to invite me in? - What's inside your room? - My ruin. There's something you're hiding... or you wouldn't stand in the doorway like that. You don't like anyone coming to your room? It's not that. But sometimes, a garden becomes so barren... it's afraid to invite Spring. Anyway, love, tell me... how did you know someone needed you badly right now? Don't speak such sweet lies. If you needed someone, you weren't helpless. Nor was my room so far away. I heard some voices and assumed you must be awake. So I came to ask why you haven't been able to sleep yet. You're asking a question whose answer I'm also looking for. I often think about it, but don't know why. And then I feel like going and lying down... in the lap of a beauty like you. Even that's not true. Or someone waits for you for hours, but you don't come. You gave me a room downstairs with all the other guests. Moreover, you hide in your room... and send the moonlight to my room to make me jealous. I can't enjoy the beautiful moonlight in the garden alone. That's what I came to tell you. You threw this scarf and called me, and here I am! - No, I didn't. - I misunderstood you? Yes, you misunderstood. I've never misunderstand women. Such meetings that happen coincidentally... are actually deliberate more than destined. Coincidentally, that day, you were standing... right where I had to pass. It's also a coincidence you're staying in my home. And it's a coincidence that you pass by me. Today, when I was having tea in the garden... it was a coincidence that your scarf fell on me. Even this is a coincidence, that you're very beautiful. - Fear God. - I don't fear anyone. I don't fear life, I don't fear death. I only fear beauty, only beauty. I'll meet you after the festival tonight. Don't forget. Who is it? Who is it? Mr. Thakur, Mr. Thakur. What happened to you? Your idol. I am very grateful to you. You saved my life today. The God who saved you is in your hands. I am nobody. Yes, He's there. He's saved me many times since childhood. Today, you saved me. Is there a connection between you and this idol? There is, but perhaps you've forgotten. - What? - That I'm a devotee of Lord Shankar. - What happened? - There was a fire. How? Someone couldn't ignite my heart, so set fire to my bed. You're always joking. Are you alright? I'm so used to burning, I never noticed the fire. This priestess arrived, or anything might have happened. But how did she become so concerned about you... that she came to your room in the middle of the night? Is she responsible for the fire? Shankar, what has happened to you? Do you have any relation with this idol. Yes I do. I think you've forgotten. - Who is it? - It's me, Thakur. What do you want? Nothing. I was strolling on the verandah when I heard you humming. I thought I'd come and ask why you haven't gone to bed yet. - Why aren't you sleeping? - How can I? The bed is burned. There's water on the floor. Then wake up the servants. Why bother them at this hour? I can't sleep anyway. - Why haven't you slept yet? - I was admiring the moonlight. It's beautiful. If you want to see the moonlight, come and see it in the garden. - Garden? - Yes. - At this hour? - Yes. The flowers look good during the day. But when you see them at night... they seems like stars floating in a milky river. When you held the idol close to your heart... for a moment I thought... What did you think? - That you're a priestess. - That I am. Your voice sounds familiar. When I hear it, I feel... like someone is calling out from my childhood. But that childhood has been left far behind. It's said that when man reaches his maturity... he begins to love new voices. He can hear the music of marriage. Then he shouldn't care for past voices. How can you talk like that? If you were left on one shore... and your companion floated away on the waves of time to the other... wouldn't you try to call him back? No, I would never be so foolish. Why do you call it foolishness? Because the sea of life and time is such... that once a man crosses it, he can never return. And if the companion across the shore... is happy with his new friends... but is made to cross the stormy waves again only for the separated mate... then the mate is being selfish. You must be very much at peace now. Who wouldn't feel peace at the Lord's feet? Aren't you at peace? No. You always keep God's image under your pillow. - Still you don't feel at peace? - That makes me even more restless. You'll get married some day. Then you'll get over this restlessness. Who told you getting married gives one peace? Then why are you getting married? Let's cut this out. Tell me, do you like my fiancé? Don't avoid my question. And don't even lie. You have my promise, tell me. - No. - Why? - She isn't a good woman. - I won't find a good woman. Why not? Aren't there good women in the world? Those that are, become priestesses like you. And no one can propose marriage to them. Forget that. Tell me, why is she not a good woman? Why do you accuse her of being no good? - Because I know. - What do you know? That she traps wealthy men and usurps their wealth. That's her business. I know all that. I can even tell you the names of men she has ruined. - And still you are... - I am marrying her. And if she wants my money in return, then I don't want my wealth at all. This wealth gave me the most painful wound in my life... and now I'm taking revenge for it. By throwing a few notes I'm buying her talent and respect. So that no one would ever respect wealth again. But you will also lose your respect in this way. So what? Even if my life is taken away from me, then how does it affect me? Only true love can give peace of mind. Without that the peace we have is nothing but illusion. Or defeat or another name for death. And I'm not going to get defeated by a woman for fake respect. I found a woman's weakness. A woman's biggest weakness is her greed for wealth. Now I'm taking revenge with the same weapon. But not all women are like that. Your mother is a woman, too. Mother! In all the books all over the world have praised mothers. But I count my mother in the same category. But your mother is so nice. She's not my mother. She's a maid. My mother passed away long ago. You spent your life within the walls of a temple. You don't know my story. An intoxicated man forgets his path. He starts walking in the subconscious state hurting himself! Because he doesn't have any other option. I don't deny my mistakes. But wouldn't you have done the same if you were in my place? May God give you everything! - Sir? - Why? I don't want to be a burden on a husband and wife. Say that you can't share the burden of my slander. If you're so stubborn... then I can also forget you. What happened, Thakur? Nothing happened to Thakur. Your Shankar is getting ruined. But what happened? - She's here? - Who? - Kamla. - Where is she? - She's in the adjoining room. - In the adjoining room? - She's Kamla? - Yes, mother, she is Kamla. But why are you sad, now that you've met her? I hoped to get her... but now even that hope is dying. But why? Doesn't she realize you're Shankar? - I think she's recognized me. - Then? But she's hiding her identity from me. She must be trying to fool you. Wait, I'll go. Don't do that! If she comes to know we've recognised her... she will leave. But why? Because she doesn't have a very good opinion about me. She feels that if I'm marrying Mohini, I've no right to love her. No one can snatch anyone's right to love. Only the price of love can be demanded. Just let me tell her once what a big price you've paid... - for her love. - Do nothing of the sort. Once she leaves, I'll never be able to see her again. Don't insist, mom. Make her stay here longer. So that before making the last move of my destiny... I'll at least see her enough. Hello, madam. What's this? The horses and guests are waiting for you to go riding... and you're not even dressed yet. I won't be able to go with you all today. Why? Do you want to go to the temple to pray? No. Someone has forcibly usurped someone's land. The one whose land has been usurped, cannot even complain. I have to go and dispense justice. You are so cruel, and people ask for justice from you. - When will you return? - Why? I won't be able to wait any longer. Only God knows who waits for whom. Oh my heart, he has left Love his memories now There is no joy in living Wait for death now Oh my heart, he has left. Love his memories now What have you got to do with happiness? You are destined for sorrow Stop expecting to be happy Accept sorrow now There is no joy in living. Wait for death now Oh my heart, he has left. Love his memories now Forget the days of joy Don't dream of love You surrendered your heart Surrender your life now There is no joy in living. Wait for death now An astrologer is here. Would you like your hand read? I don't need any astrologer. Who doesn't need an astrologer? Everyone wants to know what's in store for him. But one whose destiny has already been ruined by time... doesn't need an astrologer to tell her about her ruin. I won't mourn over the past, lady. I'll tell you what the future has in store for you. There is nothing left in my future now. All my joy was in my past, which is gone along with the past. - What is gone can return. - Can time ever come back? But friends lost can always come back. The man who left in the morning... aren't you waiting for his return? - Astrologer! - Don't lie to an ascetic. I can see the lines of your forehead and tell... that the one for whom you wait... the one for who your heart is restless, you are deceiving him. I am deceiving him? - Your knowledge says that? - Yes, you are deceiving him. Tell me. Haven't you recognised him? Look priestess, you must not lie to pious souls. I have recognised him. Then why haven't you told him who you are? He is surrounded by darkness today. And the lamp that can brighten his life... you're hiding that lamp from him. Why are you doing this? That's where you are mistaken. Just look at the facts. He's collected the stars and moon in his home. My small lamp is of no consequence there. People will laugh at me. People won't laugh at you, but at he... who collects fireflies to eliminate the darkness. Even he laughs at himself. At least you have mercy on him. Are you asking me to show mercy on him... or to beg for mercy from him? He is begging for mercy from you. You can shed tears for a stone idol. But you don't have place for an unfortunate man in your heart? Do you want the one who faltered and fell once... - to fall into an even deeper pit? - Don't say that! You become an ascetic to help the world. Can't you take care of even one soul? What can I do for him now? If I could, I wouldn't let him out of my sight for a moment. I would hide him and take him away from this poisonous atmosphere. I would save him from this brightness... which is blinding him. But time has snatched him from me. Time has brought him back to your feet, Kamla. Hide him in your heart again, Kamla. Hide him in your heart again. Astrologer, Ms. Mohini has called you. And even madam. Alright, come. I have finished with her. Priestess, if you feel I've given you correct information... give me a reward. I'm a poor priestess. I have nothing to give, but my life. I'll tell Ms. Mohini her future. - Madam... - Come, sir, sit down. You have very sharp brains. - But... - But what? But your heart is crooked. What do you mean? I'll tell you later. Right now, I see something more dangerous. You're going to suffer a big deception in soon. How? - Don't ask me that. - Why? You must not ask everything from astrologers. They'll expose you. Answer my question. What deception will I suffer? Well, if you want to hear it, then listen. You've succeeded in plundering many rich men before now. But currently, you're involved with a man... who is cheating you. You think he's rich, but he doesn't have a penny. He is neck deep in debts. He's after the wealth you've accumulated from cheating others. I'll warn you not to let yourself get involved, madam. You impudent man! Get out of here! I'm going. But at least pay me my fee. You talk nonsense and ask for fees? How am I at fault? It was written in your hand. I said, get out, or you'll be thrown out! If you throw out an ascetic, he'll curse you! Servants! Throw him out! I was so scared without you. - Really? - As if you care. Let anyone wait all day long for you, but you're too busy. What can I say? Managing an estate is hard work. What work do you have to do? I have to give and take in millions. But you only have to take, not give money to anyone. - Why not? - To whom? To those who've lent me money.. But why do you worry about all that? How can I not be worried when you are? Have you borrowed money from anyone? Yes, about half a million rupees. Don't lie to me! Those who owe half a million... don't look as carefree as you. Don't get fooled by my face. I see you and my face glows. And, truly speaking, when I have you I fear nothing. At the most, my debtors will take away my estate from me. I'll still have the wealth of your beauty. But I do regret one thing. I've squandered my wealth on others before now. But I couldn't give you anything. But then, I think, that's not necessary. You truly love me. How fortunate I am! Come out of your dream world and listen to me. Tell me. Say what you have to now. Such opportunities don't come every day. - I want to return tomorrow. - Why? My mom is alone at home. And I had a bad dream last night. - At night or during the day? - Don't joke! I'm not joking. It's not the time to joke. Two loving hearts are separating. - Why does this happen, Mohini? - What? Why does destiny separate two lovers? I'm a man. I can bear this pain. But how will you survive without me, Mohini? I'll arrange for your departure tomorrow. But on one condition. - What? - You won't shed tears for me. See! You're already crying. Stop them. Don't let them fall, or I'll feel terrible! Got time to spare? Yes, I have the time now, forever. Do you know what she was saying? I don't want to know. Don't turn away from me like that. I begin to feel lost. These lonely nights are witness... to how much this man has been looking for you, fighting against time. You'll be commiting a sin if you turn away from me. When have I ever turned against you, Shankar? Why are you making false allegations against me? How can I trust you? I fear you may consider me bad and discard me. Why? Is this what you expect of me? Not expect, I fear it. Just tell me once, and this fear will disappear. - What can I say? - Don't say, just do. - Do what? - Kiss this sinner once with your lips. So that this lifeless body comes alive again with the elixir. I'll close my eyes, Kamal. Give me whatever you want. Life, or death. My life was so barren without you... that today, despite having got you, I can't believe it. You're standing before me, but my heart doesn't believe it. It tells me, This is all an illusion, a dream. Don't believe it. This dream will deceive you again. Don't believe in it. Beware of it, Shankar! Make me believe you have actually come to me. Shower me with your tears... so that all my illusions, my fears, are washed away. You're removing me from this hell and taking me into heaven. If this isn't a dream... I'm ready to pay the price of my entire life for it. I'm ready to pay the price of my entire life for it. Thakur, you don't have the money to strike this deal. - Mother... - The soul that's renounced this world... don't take it towards ruin. We aren't going towards ruin. We want to be saved from ruin. To be saved from ruin, go to the feet of God. Don't you fear steering someone away from her path? There is fear in sin, and love isn't sin, Mother. Lost in your darkness, you've become blind, Thakur. You can't see sense. The flame of love gives sight even to the blind. I may be a sinner, but God forgives the sins of those who love truly. Come, Kamal. If I have ever wronged you in any way, please forgive me. You have never wronged me. God be with you. Love broke... all bonds Against love... the world accepted defeat My beloved took over my heart My heart bloomed... and love smiled A mischievous wind blew Every bud bloomed I was reunited with you My beloved took over my heart Everything seems different Even the earth and sky seem new We left the world... and created a new world of love for ourselves The winds came dancing... having kissed the blue skies... and erased all scars of sorrow I had no happiness My heart's bud had not bloomed Love's arrow had not pierced my heart I wasn't really living life The sound of your feet... brought along smiles... and made my life The season of Spring brought along lavish love My heart called out to you You arrived from somewhere You slowly smiled... And filled my heart with joy The winds came dancing What happened, Kamal? What happened? - Ghost. - Ghost? It came here, too? No, don't go up. You have my promise, don't go up. What mystery is this? Whose ghost is this? You don't even tell me anything. It's a very sad story. You'll get upset if you hear it. I won't be at peace if I don't hear about it. Look Kamal, we'll get married tomorrow and leave this place. I'll tell you everything then. But don't ask me anything here. Just have faith in me. Have faith in me. Tomorrow? Have all arrangements been made? Two people who love each other will get married tomorrow. No arrangements are necessary. When two hearts unite... you don't need guests, or the priest for such a marriage. Two lovers unite. May you always be happy. No dear, I am just a maid. No mother. This home was engulfed in darkness without you. Now that you're here... it seems the dark night stole the moon and brightened itself. You made Thakur wait for so long. Madam, where do I put the sweets? I'll be right back. What are you doing? Mother will come. Let her come. Why are you staring at me like that? I've been wanting to see you as a bride forever. If you only knew how much my heart has waited for this moment. Someone will see. You're not even embarrassed. All restrictions will be removed today. - And then you... - You... Don't say anything now. Just keep looking at me. I see my days, my nights, my life, in your eyes. It seems like far away in some lake... a mansion has been made by moon rays. And to reach there, the stars have lit our way. You and I walk towards it. And now, you two accept each other as husband and wife. Keep faith in each other and speak, repeating after me. First you say, Thakur... 'I accept Kamla as my wife from today.' I accept Kamla as my wife from today. Wait! This marriage cannot take place! - Get out of here! - Whenever I come, you threaten me. Why are you afraid of me? I won't eat you. - Listen carefully! - I don't have time for your nonsense. Go away, or you'll be thrown out of here! Say what you like. It's your mouth. But I won't let this marriage take place. Having one wife already, you cannot marry again. - Society has given me that right. - You sold that right. You agreed to the deal, and now you're backing out? Shame on you! You're doing an injustice to the one whose money you live on. Did you win this huge estate from gambling? Have you forgotten your promise? Don't you remember the deal you struck at all? What a shame! I've never made any deals with you. If my mother promised you anything, I'm unaware of it. Nor am I responsible for it. I have done whatever I could for your sister. And I want nothing from you in return. Take back your estate, your title. I want nothing. I'll leave here this very day. So, you don't remember the promise your mother made? You don't remember the marriage the priest performed? Perhaps you also don't remember that Sheela... whose very mention makes you go pale, is your wife. Shame on you! You are lying! He is himself mad, but makes allegations against us. He calls my sister mad. She was absolutely normal. He drove her mad. He stole her peace of mind. He did something to her. She was fine? I did something to her? All of you come with me and see for yourself... that no one can go near the one he's calling my wife. Why are you so scared? She is no ghost or witch. She's my wife, the mistress of this house. My comfort in happiness and sorrow. If you want to see the curse of life, go and see this mad woman. This gift has been given to me by you people. I've been sold. My peace and happiness have been sold. For wealth and money, I was handed over to this witch. Don't be afraid. Come and see the horrendous face of justice. See the justice of the God whose huge temples you build. And then see this woman who spews the fire of hell... with her every breath. And then see the eyes of this innocent woman... in which you'll find the solace of heaven. Everything... Kamla, open the door! Kamla, it's me, Shankar. Open the door. Sad about leaving? You've come so late. I've been waiting for you for so long. It seems like aeons have passed. Don't you want to touch someone else's husband? You must be thinking what a bad man I am. What a sinner I am. Look Kamal, abuse me if you like... but please don't remain silent like this. Say whatever you want. I want to leave. So, you want to ruin me? I want to save your honor. I cannot stay here. Who's asking you to stay here, Kamal? We'll both leave here. And never come back. No. Because I'm another woman's husband? You don't love me, Kamal? You want a husband that belongs only to you... whose everything belongs to you. You love a man's status, not him. You don't know how much I love you, Kamal. But perhaps you don't believe me anymore. You must be wondering why I didn't tell you beforehand. I didn't tell you because my sorrow hurts you, too. And I considered her my sorrow, not a relationship. There's no bond in the world which can defeat the storm of love. And when you ride this storm, why are you afraid? I found love for only a few moments, and then lost it. You are making the decision after knowing only one side of the story. Why don't you think of the one who found you after all these years? And who is not ready to lose you at any cost. You've heard only half the story, Kamal. You're not aware of all I've suffered over the years. At least hear the story of my ruin before you leave. Even that was a similar dark night... when you'd given me that idol and left. I didn't know where you were. My eyes would look out for you at the sound of every footstep. My feet never faltered in desiring you, Kamal. But I finally had to give up. I was given all the luxuries of life... but pushed towards ruin anyway. The fear of poverty made my mother sell me... and she celebrated the deal. I was watching myself being ruined. I knew my death was hidden in these silver and golden stars. And I saw this death in my wife on first sight. She was mad. Her smile was venomous... but I had taken the price of this venom. I was engulfed in scary darkness. I wanted to run away from that hell. But I felt that frightful witches were following me. They were screaming and asking me to stop. Their lips were thirsting for my blood. The fire in their breath was desperate to burn me. They were asking me to stop and listen. And then I found a new way of escape for myself. Those screams got buried in the sound of anklets. The venom of their laughter was lost in the smiles of other women. The beating of drums and other music echoed in my ears. For some time the shine of money eliminated the darkness around me. But who can find solace in the depths of humiliation? When alone, my heart always told me... I had strayed far from my goal. At such times, I would kiss the idol you had given me. I used to ask for pardon from you. What else can a man, alone and gone astray, do? And when I had lost everything... you suddenly came as a star and peeked into my ruin. That day, when I saw you hold the idol close to your heart... I recognised you immediately. - And I felt... - Enough! Stop it. Don't talk about the past now. There's no point in talking about the past, either... when the future belongs to us. I've found you now, Kamal. Your arrival makes me feel the holy Ganga has come to the sinner. I don't fear anything now. Hold my hand, and ask me to take you to a new world of our own. The river doesn't go dry when it comes to the thirsty. - Come close to me. - No! Do you want to leave me alone in that bad world... and confine yourself to stone walls? Just think how bleak my life will become without you. Don't reject the one who loves you and who you loved, Kamal. A sinner who you can reform, don't send him to the devil. He'll never be able to reform again. God will give you good sense. He only will save you. God will save me? And you? I'll pray for you. The hands that can lift in prayer... can also save a falling man. Religion doesn't permit that. Does your religion say you shouldn't help a man... fallen in muck, because you might soil your clothes? You have loved, Kamal. Like other selfish women, why are you afraid of society? Ask your heart once. Doesn't your heart say anything? I won't listen to my heart. It's crazy for you. Don't test me like that. - Let me go. - Wait Kamal! Do you still want to go, Kamal? Yes. Then go. If I want, I can compel you to stay. But then I'll only get your body, not your soul. I don't want a body without a soul. I can get many bodies. Kamal, if you don't love me, leave! Don't ever think of me. And don't forgive my sins. May God grant you peace. Don't go, Kamal, don't go. Don't go, Kamal. Where are you, oh comfort of my life? My heart calls out to you With our separation, my desires shed tears You left, having lost esteem for me Oh tormentor My heart looks out for you There are tormented desires in my eyes See this storm in my eyes Come back, this heart cries in pain Where are you? I hope you have no attachments left with the world now. No. Then this full moon, we'll have you cleansed. What are you doing? Lightning couldn't uproot it. So I'm uprooting the tree. How far will you dig? The roots are very deep. If lightning couldn't uproot it, how will you uproot it? Then what do I do? Why have the roots gone so deep? Don't be foolish. Come upstairs. Come. People think I'm mad. For God's sake, please leave. You're making me steer away from my religion. Get up, Kamla, it's four AM. Get dressed before prayers. The ritual of cleansing you will be performed today. So that your cleansing ritual is complete... burn all your worldly desires in this holy fire. Do you have an attachment with anyone in the world now? No. What about Shankar? Shankar, where are you? Who are you? I was just collecting the burned things. How did this mansion catch fire? Thakur's mad wife set it afire. Did everyone survive? - No. - Who? - The mad woman. - Did the Thakur survive? - It would be better if he hadn't. Why, what happened? Where did he go? To his old house, where he lived before. Who is it? Who are you? How did you come here? Is it night already? Day has broken only now, Shankar. But you come only at night, in my dreams. I haven't come in your dream. You want to deceive me because I've gone blind? Kamla won't come here now. I've been blinded. I have nothing left. She loves God. She loves stone idols. Why will she come to any human? But what about your love? Love? What has a woman got to do with love? You're just a dream in my imagination. That's why you come to me. You are crying? Even you are crying today? You've taken such a big price from me for this one tear of sympathy. - Such a big price! - Shankar, forgive me! Forgive me, Shankar. I'm not angry with you. You're just a dream. Even if Kamla actually came, I would forgive her. Why just forgive? I love her even today. I love her even today. Shankar, Kamla has come, and you don't even recognise her? I've been blinded, but even you have begun to dream like me? No, she's not a dream. Kamla has actually come. - She's come? - Yes. Then ask her to call out to me. - Are you really Kamla? - Yes. - Honest? - Yes Shankar, I am your Kamla. I knew you would come one day. But not your love. My love will draw you to me. Forgive me, Shankar. You took so long to come.
