Fuck me huh? No, fuck you. Come on, I'm gonna fuck you up man! Come on! Come on! Good night. - Please help me... Please... - How are you people doing out there? All right! Okay well I'm gonna do a song now for all of you cowboys and cowgirls, are you hombres and hombrettes, this here's a song about, life itself! A song about what happens when life sorta knees ya down low, you know what I mean, let me hear some hiyas out there! - Hi. - Hi! Hi sweetie. - Hey baby! Oh... - I see you're packed? - I've been packed forever, God I can't wait, I wanna go now! - I know this isn't easy, but where did you get the guts? - From you! I guess if you hadn't gone off to New York and lived to tell about it, well, I'd still be stuck here like Daddy's little girl. - I know Daddy's not making it easy. - Well few fathers ever do. It's the nature of the beast I guess. - What kinda beast is that? - Good morning, Daddy. - Good morning. - I wasn't talking about you, this has nothing to do with you. - Well if it has something to do with Tracy or with you it has something to do with me doesn't it? You know Kathie I was talking to Ms. Benson the other day about a part time job she offered you. - Dad, don't you understand? I don't want a part time anything, I've gotta go, I've gotta take a shot. - You don't gotta do anything but get dressed, that's all you gotta do, then you gotta come down and have breakfast that's all. - Dad, I can't I've got a 12-hour drive... - And you know that I never approved when your sister left home, but, it's just different Kathie, because Tracy's always been... - The wild one. - What I'm trying to say is, I was hoping-- - That I'd stay here forever and sing in the church choir right? - Well, there's nothing wrong with that, Kathie, I sing every Sunday. - Look we've been through this over and over again-- - All I'm trying to say to you Kathie, is that, if you wanna go to the city, why don't you go to Salt Lake City, I mean it's right here, it's close, you can come home, you can find work in Salt Lake City. - Dad, we're talking LA, not some foreign country. - Matter of opinion. Kathie, all I'm trying to say is, if you just wait a couple of weeks, 'cause Trace finishes work in about two weeks, and she could, she could go with ya. You haven't seen each other, really, in two years. - Kat, we'll be together! - Makes sense, I mean, she's, been out there, she knows where to go, and, what not to do, you know? - No Daddy I can't. Trace, I've always depended on you. It's just time I grew up, I'll be all right, really! Well I guess I'd better get started. - Yeah, well... I'll give you some money. - No, no I'm fine, honest. Daddy I love you. - I love you. - This ain't the way to the highway, where the hell are you going? - We've been driving nearly 200 mile now, and I figure you owe me. - What? - You've been sitting there, crossing and uncrossing them legs, I figure by now, you want it as bad as I do. - Fuck you! - You know what? I like it when you talk dirty to me, it makes me hot. - Let me go! Not as hot as you're gonna be dirtbag! - Ah, Shit! - Motherfucker! Haul ass! - What? - Look girl, I'd really like to be polite and introduce myself, but you don't really have a lot of time to think this one over. - What's going on? - Either you get this heap in gear or lard-ass over there is gonna treat us to some weird-ass kinda loving! - All right all right,. - Oh shit.

And you'll do anything and I mean anything, to get the job. All right? - Well well, what's my secondary motivation? - Fucking believe these broads? Your motivation, sweetheart, is cash, mazuma, buckos. You land the job, you get the bread. Is this concept too much for you? - Art is like life. - Yeah that's kinda poetic boss. - Yeah. - But my motivation, as a Thespian? - You're a Thespian, you guys are Thespians? That is some sick shit. - And I'm the schmuck businessman who's gonna give you this frigging job, so convince me baby, convince me. Tunz A Fun, roll the tape. - Roll sound. - Wait, rolling. - Mr. Castaglia... - Not Castaglia! Ca piletti, Ca piletti, okay! You're supposed to be acting here, okay? - Mr. Capiletti, I really want this job. - I'm sorry Mr. Kelens, I don't really think you're qualified for this job you see. - I could be very grateful Mr. Capiletti. - Hold it, hold it, hold it, all right, I don't believe this shit for a second huh? Come here, gimme that script all right? We'll do the scene without it all right? We'll do the scene without the goddamn script? - You want me to ad lib, you want me to ad lib my lines? - To hell with the goddamn script, who cares if you're frigging ad libbing? - Lunch, I think it's time for lunch. They don't wanna do the stupid scene right, huh, whatever happened to professionalism? - Okay we'll do the scene, okay? - Okay -. - Roll, tape, action. - Mr. Capiletti? You know I've always believed in good business. And, I think that if you hired me, I would be very good for your business. - Take it off. - I'm a very hard worker, and I could be very, very forever-endearingly grateful to you. I'll show you just how good. You do want good business don't you? And I'm sure that, if you did hire me, well, I would be very, very, very grateful. You do like grateful people don't you? Okay, wait, cut, is that enough? - Is that enough? That's horseshit all right, I yell cut goddammit, I'm the goddamn director, ain't I, Tunz? Ain't I the freaking goddamn director. - The last time I looked. - You stopped too soon! Don't you know the ground rules? - You gotta show skin to win. - Look sweetheart we got the best people in town. We got your best hot oil, we got foxy boxy. We do lip service, we do our own massage, and we got the greatest buns on the beach. - Hey and not to mention film classics like Dykes on Bikes, Sluts in the Slammer, Leather-Loving-Lesbos! And my personal favorite, Catholic High Shool Girls In Trouble! We got it covered! - Or uncovered. - Yeah, we're talking about heavy duty market penetration. - Penetration is my life. Hey listen with us, the two of yous could really go places. - I think the place we're really going is outta here! You coming Rhonda? - You bet. And I wanna thank you Vinny, Tunz A Fun, Mr. Tutti.

She's been gone for three days now. Kathie would call. - Dad, I didn't put her up to this, she's a big girl. She has a mind of her own. - Lemme tell you something, I'm gonna tell you something. When your mama died, and you started running around... If she does, I'm gonna lose my mind! I don't wanna lose both of you. - Dad you're not gonna lose us. I'll head for LA, I promise. I love you Dad. - Young lady this charge is serious. Now we've just watched a video tape in which you are seen to proposition Mr. Romano Capiletti. - But I told you, and I told the police, I was only acting! - Mr. Capiletti has testified that you propositioned him, there are several other witnesses, we have just seen it on video tape. - Capiletti, that's not his real name, his real name is Vinny Castaglia! - Your honor the real issue here is this, is the scene that we saw on tape an act, or was it for real? - Wait, Buck knows, he knows what we were there for, ask him! - She sure did try to come on to me the night before. And then when I took her to the school, she did the same thing to Mr. Capiletti. - Kathryn N. Collins, Rhonda Wallace, I hereby sentence you to be incarcerated in the Honeywell State Prison for Women. For a term not less than three months, nor more than two years. Court's adjourned. - Court! - This is Officer DeVever. You're under her personal supervision. I suggest you listen closely to everything she says. - You'll be housed in cellblock seven with 150 other inmates the rules are real simple, you do everything I tell you, when I tell you, and you do it right. The first you step outta line, you go in the cooler. Second time, I get real serious. - Excuse me sir. Sir? ~ Si? - There's a Mr. Lewis that lives here, and I've been calling him, my sister's staying with him. This is her, have you seen her? What's a shame? - The cops got her, lady. - The police arrested my sister, but why? - They say she was a puta. - They say my sister was a whore? - What? - Call your parents and sister. - But you said-- - And tell them you'll be out of the country on an acting job, perhaps Mexico? Yeah Mexico would be perfect, tell him you'll be back in a few months. You know with time off for good behavior, you could be outta here in, oh say, eight weeks? - Eight weeks, I can't! - You have no choice. Make the call. - But I can't lie to my dad that way. - Make the call. - Mexico, what's the matter with you Kathie, are you outta your kind? - Daddy please, you have to understand, I have to. - You don't have to do a damn thing, Kathie. - And whatever happens, I love you and Tracy. - What are you talking about, whatever happens. You're not telling me everything, there's something wrong now, come on. ' Daddy?

Couldn't you just check it out? - Dan uh, Collins? - Kathryn. - Yeah, Kathryn, day? - Day? - Yeah, when was she missing? - Last Thursday. - Thursday. - Thursday. Nothing on the computer. - You mean she was released? - No I mean she was never arrested. - Then where is she? - Ah who knows, Gladys? Doesn't take Charlie Chan to figure that one out, run this by homicides later. - Right away sir. - Okay, your sister is like thousands of other runaways, you know break away from home, and try to make it on their own. - She's not a runaway. I know my father didn't give her a blessing, but he knows where she is. - Or was. - Or should be. - So where do we look? - We don't, we wait. - What do you mean we wait. - Hey it's a big city, sweetheart. A lot of little girls get lost. - Hey look now Tracy, either your sister is gonna make it real big in Hollywood, or poverty and hunger is gonna overtake her pride and she's gonna call you. How many days have you been away from home? - Three. - She could've called you in the meantime. So what's your home number in Utah? - It's area code 307-- - Hey let me get it, let me get it. - It's area code 307. - Hey Stoner, we've got another Floater in Lake Hollywood, 16 stab wounds right up your alley sweetheart. - Up yours too. - Hello Dad, I'm fine, fine. Listen have you heard from Kat, just this morning? She called. Mexico, for how long? Two months, no Dad, I'm fine, I really am. I miss you too, I love you, bye bye. - All right then, case closed. All right? - Thanks Mr. Stoner. - Come with me young lady. - To where? - To the warden's office. Don't be afraid, all right? - Enjoy the warden, bitch! - She's fucked. - Hello beauty. - Pretty hair, whore. - Have a good time, sweetie. - Graduation day. - Come in Kathryn. - Oh no please. - Please, please? - Welcome to Honeywell Prison Camp. - Get up and get in the chair. - This is Mr. Santiago, Kathryn. He's on your parole review board. He will question you privately in our adjoining room 101. And determine whether or not you are a model prisoner. And hence due for an early release, or, you must serve the entire two year period. - Can you help me, please? I don't understand what he's saying. - I'm sure you'll have no trouble communicating Kathryn. The language of love is international. - What? - Don't be coy with me, young lady. If you'll just be kind enough to take off your uniform, we can get on with the interview. ' No! You must be out of your mind! What kind of a place is this? - This is home, this is your home. For a long, long, time my dear. - No, no please. Rhonda! Oh God, what are you doing here? - Don't fuck with Sybil, she can make your stay here a living hell. - She's right, I've been in the slammer before. And I never saw anything like this place. - This place is unreal. - No this place is real, I've seen it many times! I know every inch of this place. - You've served time here before? - No, never. Now leave me alone, I'm waiting for a commercial. - Ah, a commercial? - That's Daisy, the girls call her Crazy Daisy. - She thinks all of this is on TV. - This place is so awful, she's retreated into fantasy. - Look! That's where they shot Birdman in Alcatraz! That's where they shot Birdman in Alcatraz! - Okay Daisy, Daisy! - So what did you do to get in here, slut? Spit on the sidewalk? - I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything at all. And up in the warden's office, this man nearly raped me. - Oh, here at Honeywell, they don't just lock you up. They teach you to be sexually submissive. - Can't we complain to anyone? - To who? - Visitors? - We don't get visitors. - But they can't do that. There's laws, this is America, they can't just lock you up! - Honey you left America behind you when those doors slammed shut. - What they're trying to say is, those of us who have been locked up before, we never heard about this place. - She's right, this place is real different. - I don't get it. - Sluts never do. - All I wanna do is just stay outta trouble. - Well you shouldn't have fucking came to Honeywell then bitch! Don't you fucking touch me! Or I'm gonna pretty up your ugly little face. - Uhm I'm sorry, okay? - Yeah you are sorry, one sorry bitch. - No I didn't mean to-- - Don't you fucking touch me! - I've seen this in Chain Heat! - No, no please! - Who started it, hmm? Who? I guess some little girls are just born to be bad. Daddy's gonna take you to the quiet room. - No please God, somebody help me, no no no, no no no no! - Hello, is anybody home, hello, is anybody home? Hello, hello! - All right all right I'll be there already. Oh terrific, they finally got it right, okay now let's get in here and see what you got under those clothes. - Look, look! - Watch your step I don't want you to hurt yours... - I don't think you understand who I am. - Well, you want me to shoot you like this? - I'm not a model, I'm looking for Kat, Kathryn Collins? She's my sister. - That's right you do look like her. You got that same terrific smile. - Your building manager told me she was arrested. And then my father got a call and said she's off in Mexico on some-- - That fricking Carlos, he doesn't know a rat's ass about Hollywood, look, she got a movie, she got a gig in Mexico, and, I'm telling you, she's down there shooting a film, having the time of her life. Now let's go on in here and I'll tell you all about it. - Yeah that's wonderful but it's not like her. She would've told me. - Look she probably got too excited and just forgot to call. - It's wonderful she has a feature film and everything but she would've told me. - Look she probably just got too excited and she forgot call you all right? Now come on just sit down here, just sit down and relax. Please, we have to sit down, come. Close your eyes, close your eyes, close your eyes! There, okay now just breathe. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah how does that feel. - Feels great. - You want it harder. - Harder. - Yeah? - Hmm-mm! - You know I really should be going. - I know I know. I'm sorry I shouldn't have tried to kiss you, I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Hey tell me something, before you go, have you ever thought about being an actress? - I've done some acting in New York. - Really? - Yeah! - I could get you a part of that film that your sister's shooting in Mexico. - You could? - I could! - That would be so great. I mean the both of us working together! Do you know this is something we always dreamed out doing? How could I ever thank you? - You could give me a little kiss. - Okay -. I think that's enough. - Now come on. Where's that little smile? - I really... I think that's enough! - This will only take a minute, Dirk. This joker Buck, he said he never even heard of Kathryn Collins and I know better. - I said that's enough! - You bitch, nobody hits me, nobody fucking hits me! - No stop it! - Don't you lay a hand on her, you open the goddamn door now, open it up! - Stupid bitch, get your fucking ass up! or I'll blow your fucking head off! Fucking get the fuck away from me! or I'll kill your ass! I'll kill your fucking ass! Mr. G sent you didn't he? Kiss my ass, is that what you want? I'll kill your fucking ass! - That asshole knows where my sister is. - I'll ask him nicely. I'm gonna ask you just once. - It's Mr. G. - Where? - 7th and Broadway. - I think I have to go for a movie audition. - I like that idea a lot. - Wait, wait! Listen, let me go first, they'll believe me! As soon as I find out what's going on I'll call. - No way. - Victor's right, you don't know what you're getting yourself into! - Please I figure the agency's just one link to a chain. Chances are they'll probably put me through the same scam, she's my sister, it's the only shot I've got. - You gotta love this woman right? But if you don't call by eight o'clock. - I will pay you a visit. Let's go. - Come on doll it's time for a walk. - Where? - You have a date with an angel. - Fuck you. - No, fuck her. - Who's next? - Don't stand on ceremony my dear. Why don't you take off your things, and come and join me? - Lesbian freak! I'd rather die! ' Die? I think I can arrange that. - This way lady. - Where are they taking us? - Room 101. - What's room 101? - Just relax. EIQOY - Part of the entertainment. - Showtime ladies. - A little more soap, I know you want it pal, let's go. You look fine, honey. - So you wanna be in the movies huh babe? ' Yes. - I think we could probably help you out with that, right Erica? - Oh I think we can do that, why don't you take a look at these sides, darling? - I heard you got my sister Kat a feature film in Mexico. - Yeah that's right, and I think we could probably do for you, what we did for her. - Tracy Linn Collins, you are hereby sentenced to be incarcerated in the Honeywell Prison for Women, for a term of not less than three months or more than two years, court adjourned. - So anyway I told her, you know, that I didn't even wanna be there, that I thought that she should go by herself. - Excuse me miss. - Well exactly! That's what I was trying to tell her. - Tracy Collins? - I'll have to get back to you. How can I help you? - Tracy Collins. - Never heard of her. - You've been here all day? - No I was filling in for Vanna on Wheel of Fortune. Look gimme a break, I don't know who she is. - She was looking for her sister, Kat, who got an acting job in Mexico through your agency. - Look, I don't know what you're talking about. - Who runs this shitcan operation? - I don't know, I can't say and I don't intend to. - May I? ' Tony! - What the hell is going... And who the fuck are you? - Where's Kat and Tracy Collins? - I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - One more time sleazebag. Where are they? - Get the fuck outta here. - Inquiring minds wanna know. - Fuck you! This is for you, and this is for you! - No! - Out the door, out the door to your left, let's go, let's 9°!

Tracy what's going on? - She came to keep you company. - No, no you have to get me outta here. - It's okay, I will. - You don't understand. All that has happened in this place. Ugly ugly things! - It's okay. - Please you have to. - Oh hey it's not so bad in here is it? I'll take care of you. ' No! - Oh now, that's not a very nice way to speak to a friend. And I've always tried to be real nice to you haven't I? - YES. - Well you see then? Now you know I do. Now you just watch and you see how nice I can be. Gloria. Hey Spyder's your friend, you know that. Time to fly.

Him? He can't even control himself, goddamn animal. - Spice. Look you've been here longer than anyone, isn't there anything, anything at all that we can do to get out of here? - There's an old saying. When rape is inevitable, you ought to just lie down and enjoy it. - No I'm not lying down for anyone and neither should you! You don't have to do that! There's gotta be another way. - Well somebody better come up with a goddamn idea. - All right. Figure it out, there's gotta be a way to get a message out there. - So what's the plan? - To arrange for both of us to be taken to the warden, I'll distract her, and you make the phone call. - Distract her, how? - Good girls might get out of eventually, but bad girls get out faster. - Lesson for you, Mama. - If you would just trust me, there's absolutely no way I would let anything happen to you, just sit down right here. Yeah, you are so lovely. God you're so beautiful. - Why don't you have a drink pussycat. - I don't drink. - It would make me very happy, if you would have a drink. You do wanna make me happy? - I do wanna make you happy. - Don't turn. - Run Kat! Bitch, run Kat! - Police operator. - I need help I'm at Honeywell Prison. - Okay hold for the Desk Sergeant. - Detective Sergeant Elston. - Please help me, I'm trapped at Honeywell Prison. - Speak up lady, hey get me one of those damn donuts. Okay Stoner? - Please help me I'm trapped in Honeywell Prison. - Might that be because you're a prisoner. - Yes but I'm innocent. - I'm absolutely sure you are. Look at least give me half the damn donut. - Hello? - Huh, oh yeah, I'm here. I'm here, go ahead. - My name is Kathryn Collins and I arrived the other day from Utah, and I'm calling from the warden's office at Honeywell State Prison for Women. - In California right? California right, a Honeywell State Prison, in California? - Of course in California, look can you help me? - Of course I can help you. Miss Collins I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna fall back on all of my experience as a detective, okay? And I'm gonna conclude, that you're a basket case, one damn nut, because there's no Honeywell State Prison in California or any other damn state as best I know. - Look, there must be some mistake, please check this number 555-1313. Please help me. For God's sake don't-- - I'll do what I'll can lady. - Your wife, Elston? - Look the city is burning down and we got all of these damn idiots out there banging one another to death on the freeway, and I get this dumb lady from Utah who calls me about this-- - Uh, Utah, what's her name? - Uh name, name, I uh, I... - So, Kathryn Collins? - Bingo, so you know the broad? I mean she calls me and tells me she's in a warden's office, in some Honeywell State Prison. Now isn't that a crock of crap or what? - Yeah that falls squarely under the category, or what, now trace the number. - Yeah yeah but I gotta tap this kidney, all that coffee and all. - Hey Elston, now. - Right, I'll pee in a cup. - Get away, get away. Tracy! Tracy! Tracy! Tracy, Tracy! Tracy! - No, no, no! - Oh no, oh my God. Oh my God what have they done? No, no, no! Oh no, oh no... Gloria, no... What did they do to you? - Ssshht, welcome to the quiet room. - Oh God oh God, no no no no no no no no no! - Gentlemen, what are my bids for this beautiful young lady? ' $5,000. ' $10,000. ' $25,000. - No, no please! ' Shut up! She knows. - Well Kathryn. So you've seen through our little charade. - I don't understand. - Do the words white slave trade mean anything to you baby? - You see our international clients here, watch casting tapes and then they make out shopping lists. - We frame you out-of-town girls. Send you to a movie set prison. To break your spirit. - But best of all, is that most of the girls actually believe that they've done something disgustingly painful. - So the stupid bimbos tell their parents and their boyfriends, they're going out of the country to work on a movie. It's fucking beautiful, - No one looks for them, there is no missing person report, and if some family in the Midwest decides to check her out, where would they look, Mexico? - What about the people, the courtroom, what about all those people? - Now Kathryn that's the part you should've guessed. You see the judge, Santiago, the district attorney and me, we are all actors. - Oh God, see Crazy Daisy was right. Crazy Daisy was right... - Come on baby. - No please! - You got a new playmate, Spyderman. And you know what, we're gonna start playing with this little thing here, 5,000 volts. You're gonna shit your little pretty panty real quick. Fuck him up! Then get him the hell outta here! - Let go of me, let go of me! Let go of me! - Hold her legs down there. - I'm fine. - Get away from here! - Oh shit! - Leave here alone! Tracy get his keys, not one step! Now, give me your gun. Real slowly. Stay the fuck there! Stay there! Come on Tracy let's get outta here. - All right come on come on get up we're leaving, we're getting outta here. - I'll take them outside. - Come on, come on! - Give us the keys! - Come on! - What the fuck, what's wrong? - Holy shit we've got a breakout on four, five and six, and we got a goddamn fire. ' $0? My little angels are out of their cages? No one gets out of here alive, no one. Waste 'em. - No no no! God, no! - Ah get away from, get away, no! - Victor! - Honey, wow. - My god your arm, what happened? - Ah it's nothing. You're okay that's what matters. - I can't believe you're here. I'm glad that you cared. - Hey I care, more than you know. I thought that you might be dead. - You saved our lives. How could I ever thank you. - It was my pleasure. - No it was mine. - What about your dream? Did that die in there too? - It's not dead Victor, not ever. It's still alive and I'm gonna make it in this town, you'll see I'm gonna be a star. - Ah you're already a star, they just don't know it yet! - Take care Tracy. - But where are you going? - Gotta see a man about a war. You coming? - No. I got a tougher fight here in LA. I gotta keep her outta trouble. - Kat, where's Rhonda? - She was with us. Oh my God she's still in there! - No Kat! - Rhonda, Rhonda? Rhonda? Where are you, Rhonda? Rhonda? Rhonda? Rhonda where are you it's Kat. Oh God it's too late. - I need you to come back for me. - Kat, Kat? - No, no, no, no! - Die motherfucker!
