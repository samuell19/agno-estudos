So now we might ask, but how can we do something so that bit by bit, preserving this evolution of the average, which looks quite reasonable we move from the quantum to the classical setting? The idea is clear - we have to look at systems. What systems? Ones in which the operator would have more eigenvalues Let's erase this, so I have some room. Excuse me? No, Weyl - Weyl matrices is the second one - Well, let's have a look X squared, dp/dX squared and X dp/dX Z1 dp/dZ1 minus Z0 dp/dZ0 - Sorry, sometimes I may lose a half... - Doesn't matter Yes. For simplicity I'll look at some matrices... Sigma plus Z1 dp/dZ0 And sigma minus Z0 dp/dZ1 What have we got here? Here you are What is this? - The Ogoniok magazine - The Ogoniok magazine Close your briefcase please and we'll continue with the search - Dubosarsky, hold this please - With pleasure, Shein Go on through Sign here Come here please Shein Who are you? A guest? - Are you a guest? - I'm a film director I'm making a film about the Institute Turn around please Take off your hat please Thank you, sign here please - Thank you - You're welcome May I ask you for your pass? Take off your headgear please - Thank you - Sure May I have your arm? - Undo your coat please - Of course What have we got here? - Come through and sign here - Sign there please - Thank you - Your briefcase please - Of course - Can you undo it please? Yes Wait there Thank you Comrades, here is our Institute There are the residential blocks On the left you can see D2, Dau's apartment On the right is D1, a kind of dormitory for Institute employees and scientists Dubosarsky - I'm just looking - An artist has to see everything This is work for me Above you can see Comrade Krupitsa's office He's the Director of the Institute He's away on business right now To the left and to the right, we have laboratories Here's the small lab and the big one is over there There are other services in that building, we'll visit them as well - How many people work at the Institute? - 300 - 300 - Every day? Yes, they are the permanent staff Do they work at weekends as well? Our scientists don't have a fixed schedule They often stay late at night in the laboratories The theoretical scientists may also have discussions at any time of the day: weekends, holidays, at night or at home - In the theoretical department, maybe - They live in science Yes, of course This staircase leads to Comrade Krupitsa's office, but no one has access to it, apart from Comrade Krupitsa It's called the Road to God That's our transport service I would have called it the "Road to Evidence that there is no God" That's an interesting thought - Hello comrades - These are our guests I would like to introduce you to our paper: The Institute News This is our editor-in-chief, journalists, make-up person and a photographer This is Sidko, Head of Personnel I will briefly introduce our guests then there are a few more formalities There is one more formality to take care of, but it's very important We'll have a chance to talk more later Let's go to the office of the Deputy Director for Order and Security We need to sign a few agreements Sure One by one, who's first? Shein can go first In the meantime, shall we sit down? Of course, have a seat I would like to introduce our guests Dubosarsky, a famous Soviet artist Dubosarsky will draw a set of pictures on life in the Institute This year our Institute turns 15 years old So on Comrade Krupitsa's invitation and following an order from the Ministry of Culture, these series of drawings will be completed I, the undersigned, hereby sign that I hereby sign that I am required not to disclose - Not to disclose - What? Not to disclose I am required not to disclose Comma, top secret and classified information We try to work here professionally All the journalists are great professionals and individual people We try to write not just dry information We want it to be interesting and articulate Professional information We want it to be interesting to read for all our employees, as well as the elite scientists, including about what they're doing because it's their creative portrait we're showing through our writing We're also trying to illustrate it too, we have photojournalists here We try to make our paper look appealing, so it's pleasant to pick up and interesting to read From the first article to the last, from the front page to the back We want it be interesting to know what's happening in Moscow theatres, cinemas and art exhibitions, and what's going on in the world We also understand that the conditions are not easy after the war With Comrade Stalin's help, we raised the country from devastation Now we're heading in the right direction towards our bright socialist future All together our scientists and colleagues do a lot for this country, for its defence and agriculture too So we have a huge responsibility the press and information is always a huge responsibility, be it in word, image or film It's very important that everything is correct and precise We're trying to work in this direction We work on ourselves as well, creatively We look through the press and classics such as the works of Marxism and Leninism We study the works of comrades Stalin and Lenin This is how we work We wanted to make a few pictures and an interview We don't have enough light here, so I'll move this lamp here - Does this bother you? - No We had this guest here before, a photographer for the state press agency We spoke about how if the lighting isn't great, a shot can be used as a documentary and staged - Is this going in the next issue? - Yes That will be nice I will tell you when to be ready It would be nice to have one in the yard of the Institute Yes, we would like to do one there as well It's very beautiful there and it would be nice to make use of that Take some shots for memory - It's already night time unfortunately - Unfortunately, yes - Have you taken it yet? - Not yet, I will now We've been travelling for a long time You have to for just a moment Yes, freeze please for a moment. Look into the camera Our photographer is also a very talented man It seems your work is crossing over with our photography work - That's true - Yes We're trying to make it not only informative, but so that it captures the moment and portrays one's soul, eyes and heart We want to show the profession as well, as in a portrait photo or any other So the next generation understands everything Can you swap places? - If possible, yes - With pleasure Come in, we'll take another The road was long and wore us out a bit - Hello - Please, have a seat - What's your surname? - Dubosarsky Dubosarsky, Dubosarsky Let's find you Take the pen, please and we will write the agreement I would like to warn you right now that everything you learn here during your tour of the Institute must die here Maybe clean the nib The text is long, so write in small letters - Take this pen - It doesn't write well Don't press down too hard, it will come out neater that way Signed acknowledgement It's a bit awkward, we came to film you, but instead, you're filming us - You're our guest - So we have to look after you - Yes - Pay attention - That's great. Now, two of you - Of course Let's do one with your newspaper, I think that would be good - Like we are studying your work... - Let me check what issue is that Sit down here, Vladimir. Let me direct it a bit - Please, sit - It's me then Can you see it well? Let's turn it like this, so the name is on show. Take it Unfortunately I am long-sighted When I drove a car, it's fine but I have to wear them when I read the paper That's good "Festive gifts for soldiers at the front." Yes We can't see the paper Can't see it? Right Yes, like this. That's great - Can you see me well? - Of course Just freeze for a moment Attention Perfect - One more? - Yes, let's. Just in case We can do one for memory, without a newspaper - No, let's have the paper! - The paper is good! A backup shot Wrap it around like that The work which is to be performed I am familiar with Have you written it yet? "I am familiar with" New line: The legal responsibility for the disclosure of information consisting of government and military secrets One moment "Regarding the disclosure of information" Consisting of - Consisting of? - Governmental and military secrets Military secrets? Comma, and loss of documents Equipment Technical equipment and weaponry I have been warned Write your surname clearly Now put your surname here and your initials This is a very interesting question We filmed in the rear where life was carrying on We would go wherever the studio sent us But most of the time we were at the front line When you have a camera in your hands, you zoom in and take away anything that's irrelevant You find yourself at the heart of events - Good day - Hello - Vodolagyn - Have a seat, please Thank you We have to write an agreement now - Right - A non disclosure agreement The work of the Institute is a secret You will learn a lot of new and interesting, - including governmental secrets - Sure You should store it here, don't share it with anyone Not your impressions or opinions, not with anyone - I see - Go ahead. Do you have your own pen? Yes, they gave me a good pen Great. Let's close this ink well then Here it is: Signed acknowledgement Alright, signed agreement - I, the undersigned... - Like this? My job as a documentary filmmaker is to love the characters Understand them and open them up. I should go from them, not from myself as the artist and impose my creative view on a given situation But rather to feel the life situation as an artist and pass it to you with the same feeling and emotion, which I put into it and which I want to give to you My aim in my work with you is not to swap myself - with my desires or attempts as a director - and represent your Institute through my imagination But rather to feel your atmosphere; to notice small details such as your hands, ink or notepads; to look into the essence of what you do and capture this atmosphere So I can love it, feel it and gently communicate it That sums up my profession as a documentary filmmaker - If possible, two more photos - Of course Separately Stand there behind, that'll look good No, Dubosarsky first - We've already taken one there - Have you? That was my first one You can even stand up as a pair And I'll sit in the middle, or what? No, Dubosarsky sit down. You're the older comrade Wonderful, great composition You can ask questions in the meantime - Vodolagin - Yes? Our fates have almost intertwined I also took part in the defense of Moscow I was injured and sent to the Institute after my injury in 1942 Also, in 1930, the Party sent me to the Institute of National Economy before calling me back The Party then sent me to a legal institute, where I graduated I was also wounded and decorated, just as you So the destinies of everyone in our generation are intertwined Our generation went through it all: the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War We survived This is very well portrayed in your paper I have recognised many familiar surnames in there - Hold for second - Just a second please, look here Right here, right here Thank you very much I hope we will work together again - Thank you very much, goodbye - Thank you - Thank you - It was nice to meet you - I think we'll work together again - Thank you Goodbye, nice meeting you Comrades, hello - Hello - Hello Hello, Blinov I would like to introduce you, this is Blinov Head of the Experimental Department at the Institute This is Semenych, Head of the Quantum Theory Laboratory in the Theoretical Department Here you can see a vortex A tornado A tornado No, a tornado is found in the atmosphere This is called a vortex Is something spinning it from the bottom? Of course Through mechanical action, we get a certain movement in the water And what is it? What do you mean? What's the secret? - Why does it happen? - Yes To change the water structure so later we can study how much the water's energy capacity has changed From a theoretical point of view, the phenomenon of turbulence we observe here still doesn't have a complete theoretical model People don't really understand what is happening in particular, the macroscopic process of the water's movement causes the water to spin on all levels, right up to the molecular level and what is actually happening during this time, honestly theoretical science doesn't know There is no complete theory of turbulence So any experiment involving turbulence, we have to take seriously Shein, allow me to explain This is an ordinary photo laboratory but it has a very extraordinary part So if you just turn around and pay attention to this unusual object This is a device for taking aura photographs And how does theoretical physics react to the experiment? Theoretical physics... Let me say that Theoretical physics doesn't really understand the phenomena of life As you know, according to the second law of thermodynamics the system must descend into chaos But it would appear life is... - Ordered - Yes There's organisation and a formal contradiction Right now, people don't understand the phenomena of life If we get bonuses here, good ones After we've made the film It has to be good I wanted to ask if there were any shops around here We have a canteen What if a person needs some fancy goods or food or something? How does it happen? Is it all provided for? Yes, of course Let's say this is a neutron and a hole around it and a hole has appeared around it A Descartes vacuum is formed, you see this vessel here We have a neutron on one side and elementary volume on the other It's the same Descartes vessel only formed by quanta Now look The Descartes vessel collapses as the elementary volumes try to close this hole with their bodies Therefore all the elementary particles move towards the hole I'm sure that wherever particles decay, holes are formed But there's no decay in your experiments But there is acceleration Let me give you my opinion We've been listening to you patiently You promised us a quantitative theory - Do you have it? - I do Write out its formula, please - Look... - The formula, please Just a minute If two points emit holes, a force forms between them Wait, Newton had mass there This has nothing in common with Newton's formula Wait But the denominator has the same term. Tell me please Does your formula contradict Newton's theory? - Does it agree with it? - They are in perfect agreement Hold on Forgive me, but Newton had mass in the numerator That's a mistake Newtons? Thank you Have a rest - We'll have a think - Alright I actually have a friend Rasun Irchukovich is his name He is from Karachay-Cherkessia - And... - That's an autonomous republic, right? He has a son, a really wonderful boy A mathematician He is 7 years old and he hung a blackboard up by his bed he wakes up at night and writes something whatever formulas come into his head and then he goes back to sleep In the morning he analyses it He looks it over with his father - So at night, he has these... - We'll have to bring him here - He is still small - He needs to develop He is developing, he's working He wins all school contests We're going to see the barber shop now You wanted to know how we sort out day-to-day issues - Wonderful - Good evening It's a good number 2145 - Lucky - It is Hello, can we come in? - Where now? - To the hairdresser's - Hello - It's still open Of course, it's still open Careful - We have all the latest tools - I see from worldwide industry: we have hair dryers This here is a brand-new movable hair dryer We also have a perming device - It's been brought from abroad - Right Like a trophy I think Russian factories will soon be releasing these Our girls all have hair styles which hold on for a long time So they have more time for scientific work May I try out the male cologne? - Well, we have... - I'm joking, thank you - Thank you - Thank you very much - Good luck - We'll be happy to see you Thank you, goodbye What are we doing today? Just a bit because my hair is short anyway A bit on the sides Not too short? Not too short Here's a courgette. Careful You're sliding down Don't mess around You're still chewing your meat. I can see it Meat here, meat there Meat there too. Eat it all up Swallow it and show me your mouth Swallow it and show me your mouth I still see meat in there I have meat in my mouth too - I have - Me too Is there a spare key? They do Who has the keys? Ministry of State Security Which room does Leshan live in? Are you relatives? No, neighbours Stay here and don't move until we finish the search Ministry of State Security Get up - Leshan? - Yes You're under arrest Get dressed Put your trousers on Who else is here? - There's no one - No one? Igor, start the search - Right, witnesses? - The witnesses are here Come with us, please You'll be present during the search Hurry up and get dressed Leshan, get dressed quicker Leshan, sit down What's all this? It's for the mosquitoes, I can't sleep because of the mosquitoes - Does it help? - A little, yes Pack some underwear Very well What's that? The keys Put it on record Chuck it Reading German authors? These are not my books Whose are they? They're just kept there, I haven't even read them Stand up I don't even know German so I can't even read them Where do I sign? Leshan, come here Get ready. Gather your personal belongings And hurry up That's enough, put your coat on Here, surname and signature Take the towel. It'll come in handy Wait a moment Wait, can we seal the room? We need to seal the room - Or do the neighbours live there? - Yes - Alright - Shall I turn off the light? Yes, turn off the light We've been informed that Comrade Leshan confessed to espionage and planning acts of terrorism at the Institute From the moment when citizen Leshan appeared among us the laboratory always had questions about to his so-called scientific theories He could never explain what he was doing in the special lab entrusted to him and built with the money of workers and peasants or what he was using the Institute's equipment for and what he spent state funds on He couldn't even explain it to the Academic Council or in the numerous talks he had, not only with me but with other Institute employees as well When offered help, he reacted in an inappropriate and unfriendly way He behaved like a man of property and an individualist and proved himself not to be a comrade While we work with energy from burning carbon hydrate, it's better not to go to space It will be completely ineffective I suggest developing the human race, until the rocket flights will be more common Semenych, sounds like cosmopolitanism to me Cosmopolitanism has nothing to do with it Flying to space is still a childish fascination, which we haven't matured enough for yet Is that also measured in horsepower? What is? Everything can be measured in horsepower, if needed I'm just wondering how many little horses you'd require You'd need really large horses for rocket flight You can have tiny ones, but a lot of them I'd put it this way: who's doing it now... Ponies? - Even smaller - No, just really small ones That's not right Here's a reasonable approach: It would be reasonable to build a tower and have a magnetic lift I want to say that humankind can't live without space exploration I'm trying to explain one thought, which is very unpopular And this thought... I didn't read about tiny horses in Alexey Tolstoy but in another forgotten, unknown author There all these little horses, as many as you could wish for As the Academic Secretary of the Institute, I would like to raise a toast to the bond between Soviet scientists and Soviet artists in the wide understanding of this word I think it's very important that lately these links are getting stronger Various groups of artists often visit the Institute And I hope that Comrade Shein and Comrade Dubosarsky will reflect this great experience of cooperation in their work I hope your bond will only get stronger and deeper Also, I obviously can't say this toast without mentioning Comrade Stalin who allowed this Institute to exist, work and conduct research So, to our bond, to Comrade Stalin and to our Institute Hooray - To Stalin - To Comrade Stalin This chamber is for checking Kazimir's effect It's in working order, the installation is basically complete But the experiments are just at the start We will switch on the magnets in impulse mode The perfect mode is when the operating times of all the electromagnets - or rather, the whole system of electromagnets or the shells of electromagnets - which should work... Each shell should be synchronised So the ideal operating time of each shell equals the time it takes for the magnetic field to reach the centre of our device You know that the lack of a magnetic monopole in a field created by electric currents follows Maxwell's equations? What you're saying is a flat contradiction of these equations If you spot any contradictions feel free to tell me I don't see any I think our comrade should at least acquaint himself with modern physics I have nothing against theoretical calculations But my goal was different this time He should have shown us a formula or graph If you can't show a graph He drew a graph, but anyone could do that No, from time to time... All right, I'll say this: experimental physicists never draw graphs like that unless they're lunatics or conmen There's nothing to discuss here Nothing at all Ministry of State Security Do you have a warrant? We've got everything Who do you live with? Go back to sleep Have you got a warrant? Go back to sleep Go ahead Turn on the light What's your name? Chernobrov Stand next to the bed Chernoborov? Here's a warrant for your arrest Confiscate these Confiscate the journal Everything has to be confiscated Are those your documents? Yes Write your surname and sign Your signature Stay here We'll all be taken away, what can we do comrades? We'll all die in the end Eventually each of us will be taken What can we do now? - You see - Is that what you're waiting for? It's like the plague in the Middle Ages. So what? Everyone knew they'd die soon enough There's nothing we can do We're all waiting. It's nothing new And we're sitting here with terrified faces, as if we found out yesterday As if we live on another planet I don't know what strength of nerve you have What do you mean? I have no nerves left Can you see any nerves here? Relatively, it won't be so bad for them, I hope We are scientists And we are at one with our country And we also forge weapons. Our weapon is truth Our weapon is powerful too That's why I think that if your work doesn't lead to a scientific truth then it's a crime and it should be punished under wartime law That's why Comrade Chernobrov's incompetence is a crime We must condemn this crime We should also make a separate statement A resolution on behalf of all our scientists To state that we understand everything and we'll fight to make sure that it never happens again Why are there so many glasses? What do you get up to here, comrades? What's down there? We have guests sometimes Put everything on top of the safe please Move this telephone, we only care about the documentation Shall we go through them one-by-one? Sure Here's the documentation Today's information is different from yesterday Yesterday the graphs were blank They weren't blank, they simply weren't filled in How's a blank graph any different? Since we have two labs How come are they filled in now? Yesterday you were asked not touch anything Not to write and not to add anything - Is this yours? - Yes Blinov can tell us who was on work trips - This doesn't concern him, but you - Right Who filled it in? What for? Comrade Blinov Why aren't you relaxing at home? We've been called Go ahead then No one needs to introduce our good friend and colleague Nekrasov Our reason for gathering here is delightful I suggest that Dima continues with the toast He can explain everything but I'd like to say that I've never met a more wonderful colleague than Nekrasov I suggest you all think What do you mean, Samson? Not the meaning of life, we'll think about that later Now I suggest you think about how lucky we are in our work and personal life when our friend is also our colleague I propose a toast to the birthday boy Nekrasov - Nekrasov! - Nekrasov! I'd like to add to this toast We're all drinking and the birthday boy is cutting the chicken! We can always rely on him in the hard times, and the happy times in our lives To your health Dear comrades Dear birthday boy, Comrade Nekrasov I wrote some lines of poetry for you today I hope they are worthy of our birthday boy today Our dear Comrade Nekrasov Happy birthday to you May your multitude of talents increase with inspiration During these hard times We're following the right path Everything that's possible and impossible we will construct and invent So that our Soviet nation grows every day Our scientists will do anything and keep their loyalty to our Party Dear Comrade Nekrasov There are discoveries waiting for you Your whole path is open before you You're always welcome in our Institute Bottoms up Bottoms up - Maybe some Armenian cognac? - Champagne Or some lemonade? Let's say it took place in Korea where combat operations are going ahead When an American prisoner was captured Some of our comrades were sent to interrogate him The comrades ask him a question And they punch him in his stomach He says The comrades are not pleased and they punch him in the face They ask The crying prisoner says The really annoyed comrade says I'm asking you, scumbag, Where the hell are your tanks!? Let's drink to theoretical physics On an evening like this, I would like to to share this great happiness of being the part of this wonderful family in our Institute where it's so pleasant to live and work and to enjoy life and work To all of you, my dear friends, thank you very much Hooray! Hooray! I would like to read to you a decree of the presidium of the supreme Soviet Union about amnesty As a result of the consolidation of the Soviet social and state system, improving the welfare of the cultural level of the population growth of the responsibility of citizens their honest attitude towards the fulfilment of their public duties strengthened the legitimacy and the socialist order and a decrease in criminal rate The presidium of the supreme council of the USSR thinks that in these conditions there is no need to further imprison people who committed a crime but do not pose a great danger to the state and in their attitude to work they prove that they can go back to an honest, working life and become productive members of society Here you have to understand that for the first time in its history, the Soviet government has taken upon itself the responsibility and has released a large amount of criminals Although these people are completely different, but the Soviet government sees in them people who are able to re-educate themselves Alongside people who have actually corrected themselves, a certain number of people will be released who have been set free by mistake All of the colleagues at the Institute have at least some indirect ties to people who have been condemned, not only those who were victims of judicial errors and I would merely like to express the hope that from this moment on there will be a systematic re-examination A systematic analysis, so to say, of the legal system The main principle of our ideology is attention to the human being Not to the human being as an abstract idea but to specific people who built Communism who are geared towards Communism and useful work for the benefit of society And that The step our Party is making is risky, of course but the Party has evaluated the situation and made this decision And regardless of the risks that have been voiced, of course we need to take them into account as well, Regardless of the inevitable incidents, while having such enormous and large-scale amnesty I am very glad fundamentally that such a decision was made and it has been decided that the time has come I would like to speak not so much about vigilance, but the humanism that our Communist Party has shown and I think we need to pay attention to this and we should respond to this breakthrough I think that the Communist Party is showing an example that we should trust each other more and we should correspond This means that we should, of course be strict with the various negative things that we sometimes see But treat them with humanism as the Communist Party shows us, it is the one in command and shows us the direction to follow Semenych, is this your vest here? Yes Take off your jacket and put on your vest, it'll feel good and light And warm. What do you think? We have to take it to our room anyway Yes My vest It's hot, right Semenych? Fine Help me, please With your jacket? Give it here No, let's hang it here, you won't forget it then I will Shall we put it in our room? When do you think debauchery came to the Roman Empire? Together with Elagabalus No, when they stopped diluting wine with water They always drank wine with water - They stopped... - Barbarians They saw everyone as barbarians From at least the 6th century BC they saw any neighbours as barbarians Those who drank undiluted wine It's as if Blinov were to say to me, "You're drinking..." Or no, if I said to Blinov "Blinov, you're drinking 40 per cent alcohol and I'm drinking 12 per cent That means you're a barbarian" A complete barbarian But I'm not saying that That will allow me to sink my teeth Don't consider me a bloody tyrant It's a shame they didn't have beer They did, and plenty of it Beer has always existed The Egyptians had beer, we don't have any The Egyptians had it, but we don't In the 17th century the English drank beer, and not water Even small children Water was hardly drunk anywhere in Europe in the Middle Ages It carried the plague Cholera, not the plague The plague doesn't spread via water Choleric Dasha, don't fuss Why exactly? Have you seen any matches? You love Tchaikovsky, don't you? Of course Traditionally, the man plays When lovers are together the man should play the guitar You're right But we do it the Japanese way What do you mean? There, it's the woman who plays No, we do it the Soviet way It's always me: while being fucked, I'm also playing What? Yes Semenych The Soviet state gave you an education, a good job, a woman you love and here you are, deceiving it I'm grateful to the Soviet state for all it's given me and I've never deceived it Why are you hiding your background? I've never tried to hide my Jewish origins But it says here: "Russian" The document says "Russian" It's written in your own handwriting We won't get anywhere this way So You go on about humanism, everything's nice and quiet Turn the other cheek Right? The directive talked about it About what? About humanism. I haven't made anything up You're always banging on about your fucking humanism Nothing is good enough for you, you always want something different You want everything nicer, smoother You can't have it that way. You just can't What's going on between you and your wife? - Nothing - What do you mean, nothing? She's a student, isn't she? How is it possible that she managed to get a job at the Institute as a junior researcher, without a university degree? She's been involved in hands-on research for a long time Staff regulations state you can't do this job without higher education Could you explain what happened? There was an agreement With whom? There was an agreement Isn't the law the same for everyone? It is I think you're confused Simply confused You're a weak person by nature You need protection There's no one at the Institute who's able to protect you, except us No one cares about you You have no value as a person As a scientist yes Look at what your country gave you Did it give you the Order of the Red Banner of Labour? Yes The Order of Lenin? Yes Higher education? Yes The Stalin Prize? Shouldn't you give something back? Let's summarise You help us in our activities We in return help you We protect you become your patrons and stand by you Deal? I have never... Is it a deal or not? Yes or no? What will be... Your responsibilities? Yes When something comes to your knowledge, inform us When you learn that an enemy is plotting something, inform us We'll give you a specific task Your task will be specific We'll give you a set task for each person Apart from your academic research, you'll provide additional help - That's the idea - Secret help No one will know about it, of course Two people will know about it, us It will stay in this office It will help you in the future Who knows what turn your life might take? Yes or no? No No? Alright then Sorry Don't apologise, that's the way it is It's your choice Pavel, let's do it differently If he doesn't want to sign this, let him sign the non-disclosure agreement Non-disclosure agreement of state secrets Of course He'll sign it. Have you got the form? Here's the text Here write your full name Leave the lines where I showed you Copy it out up to here Then sign it, with your surname and date Shall I read it out for you? It's alright This conversation is a state secret, of course It must not be disclosed as well He's an intriguing man One minute he's being soft Taking things carefully The next minute he refuses "I can't, I don't want to, I won't" "My country has entrusted me with an important job It awarded me prizes Did it give me titles and medals? It did But I won't help it, I don't want to" That's his Jewish nature speaking Careful, don't ruin my pen What's this here? "USR"? It's spelt with two S's Heart problems? Why are you breathing like that? I'm a bit tired Why? Tired of watching non-stop drinking sessions at home? You don't drink yourself Why do they drink all the time? Work is tough, they have to relax And you? I relax a little too Of course You can't expect a cosmopolitan to relax a lot Put the pen down, stand up Face the wall Hands on the wall Fuck knows what he's got on him Are you going to cooperate? Answer me, you son of a bitch! Answer me No? No? No Repeat that No I'm counting to three Fucking bitch Answer me, you son of a bitch No Look at the son of a bitch. Fucking Jewish mug Shall I give him one in the liver? No, don't cry Everything alright? Don't cry Look, he is smooth Look how he's standing Nice and smooth, good boy They'll like him in the cells Are you going to cooperate? I'm asking you again No No Who was the biggest smart-arse at the table yesterday? Our little humanist What did Pavel tell you? He asked you what state security is. What did you say? "Yes, yes, yes" "Yes" You stupid cunt Fucking Yid I really want to hit, crush him against the wall That fucking directive. My hands are tied No one will know Sit down Come on, sit down Finish writing. You're fucking disgusting Semenych, that's enough. Calm down I can't fucking read your writing I can't understand a thing Don't rush Semenych, don't take it to heart Maybe I overdid it It's just stress You think I find it easy? I struggle too Dear Semenych, we aren't made for grief You'll finish this and go home Wet your whistle Grab your Dasha by the arse And you'll forget all about it. Right? Everything is good What date is it today? The fifteenth of the fourth Here you go Thank you Semenych, tell me is Dasha cheating on you? I don't know "I don't know" "Don't know" Shouldn't you know? You're a big boy and you don't know shit Off you go Go, Semenych We'll be friends Goodbye Will you manage on your own? Yes, thank you Go on Everything will be alright How are you, my dear friend? Come here We had a little talk And? I signed a non-disclosure agreement regarding military secrets Well Can I have a little drink please? Of course We're that kind of Institute Take your boots off, you'll muddy the floor You'll be calmer soon - Do you want some vodka? - Yes Watch you don't burn your jacket again Careful, there's a cigarette under you It's gone, sit down Don't lie about on the floor Have you drunk your vodka? Have some more, Semenych It's medicine You need vodka Maybe a hot shower We have problems with the hot water I could have a cold shower Shit, fucking vodka What's this? Have you spent your salary? Dima, could you see my husband for a minute? One moment Is it a coat? No idea, I haven't unwrapped it yet Feels like a coat Maybe dresses? Is it a cake? Is it your favourite cake? Where's Dima? Dasha called him in to talk with Semenych Ira, please hold these This is what I call love Something soft It's a fur coat It's not just a fur coat I want winter again I couldn't object to anything they said They mocked me, pushed me against the wall They wanted to beat me up They insulted and humiliated me I'm just warning you Letting you know Furs have no effect on me Though Olya does, of course I've got a cold attitude to furs but I understand they make people warm They're warm indeed What about their beauty? Beauty is inside and out Stand on the table It's not the fur that makes the person but the person makes the fur That's true Olya and I have known each other a long time It really suits me, right? It does The red fox Would you be excited about a new carburetor? There'd be the same reaction I think it might be useful for housework Dima You're a real prince Now kiss her too It's my second face now See what's happening? This salami... - You dropped all the salami? - I did There, eat it Thanks See, you picked it all out. Specially for me Eat it I'll just make you another one No, one's enough If you want it later, the salami will be waiting - Where will we live? - At my parents' place In Zamoskvorechye. You can commute here That's a possibility, of course Or rent a little corner from someone, I don't know You're gorgeous - Fox - What a fox Yes Beautiful What a stunning coat So nice Beautiful Let's drink to it Not right now Olya, don't be angry with me I really like the coat But I'm a bit tired now Alright? You see, it's all good You can't put roses in alcohol Why? They'll suck out the water So let them They'll wither very quickly You see You know all about that But what a fur coat You see, everything's fine There's nothing to be afraid of As Dima explained Your medicine I wouldn't call it that Go to bed, Semenych. That's enough sitting around You're right That's enough Enough is enough Right Look at all these crumbs Pig You're a pig Semenych Semenych Yes? - How are you, my dear fellow? - He's fucked up, Blinov I'm talking to Semenych - The door's shut, Blinov - They called me Dasha, I'm talking to Semenych And I object to that, Blinov. The door was closed - Dasha, Semenych is an adult - Right now he's a sick child He can speak for himself, Dasha I'm talking to Semenych, leave us alone, Dasha Semenych, please tell Blinov what you think Semenych, what happened? They called me in But Dasha, you wanted me to say what I think I want you to say what I want you to say Here and now Do you understand? I do The main thing is not to be sad Just hold on and everything will be well Thanks - Dasha - Good night, Blinov Being a bitch isn't the best human quality - Good night, Blinov - I really want you to know that Being an overbearing prick isn't the best quality either - You're half my age, so behave yourself - Goodbye, Blinov I'm so glad you paid us a visit. Good night - Being a bitch isn't the best quality - Good night - Dasha, you're a bitch - I'll bear that in mind. Goodbye Go and tell him to fuck himself I'll leave unless you do it right now You go and say, "Blinov, go fuck yourself" Go and say it to him right now. Got that? Yes Go now and say "Blinov, go fuck yourself" "Don't come in when the door's closed" Do it right now I think you're right Blinov I'm listening, Semenych Don't... Have you forgotten the words? Shall I write it down? Semenych, if you want to talk to me, you're most welcome Blinov Most welcome Don't insult my wife - Semenych - Is that clear? Make sure she behaves Blinov, she was in her own room, and you came in Don't insult my wife If I'm invited, I come Semenych, you tell me, and I'll go Is that clear? Semenych, if you want to tell me something, go on Did you tell him to go fuck himself? - In four letters? - Literally? Did you? I didn't literally say "fuck himself" So go and do it Go and tell him to fuck himself Otherwise I'll tell you to fuck yourself That's your dichotomy What did that idiot say? Fuck, excuse me Do you understand me? I told him... Do you understand me or not? Smashing his face... No, we won't smash his face in now, we'll tell him to go fuck himself That's the stage we're at. We have it all planned out I did it another way Do it the way I'm telling you Right now Why should I? Because I'm asking, can you do that for me? Can you tell him to go fuck himself? In those exact words? Yes, Semenych "Blinov, go fuck yourself, and don't ever enter a closed room again" That's what I said, Dasha No, say to him, "Blinov, go fuck yourself" "Please come and apologise to my wife, "And go fuck yourself." Can you do that? Can you or can't you? Exactly like that? Yes I wouldn't want to Then I'll get my things and leave, right now. Nothing's keeping me here I don't give a shit about this science I don't give a shit about this Experiments Department. Understand? Dasha, should I go? No, I don't mind you, don't mind you at all May I say something? Are you trying to teach a lesson to Semenych or Blinov? If you tell Blinov to go fuck himself he won't care - But for Semenych it's very hard - Semenych He needs to learn I don't give a damn about Blinov, but I have to live with this person Does it have to be done right now? Yes Yes, right now It's just hard on him right now One thing after another I think he'll cope - Of course he will - He usually manages I need to be able to rely on my husband at all times So that Blinov can't stand there and insult me like that And so my husband can protect me at all times To me, that's important Do you see my point of view? Have I answered your question? Semenych, understood? I'll go and get my things I'll resign from the Institute and go and live with my parents Unless you tell him to go fuck himself Dasha, Blinov's not there anymore So he has to find him and tell him to go fuck himself I think he'll do his best Blinov, can I speak to you for a moment? I want you to apologise to Dasha But of course, let her come here No, you must come and say you're sorry But she kicked me out of the room, right? I want you to come and say sorry to her Is she going to let me into her room or invite me, or what? I don't know I'm not going to break in You can say it loudly, Blinov, I can hear you perfectly well Dasha, I'm really sorry It's over, Blinov, I forgive you Dasha, I can't hear you very well, I'm deaf - Can I take that from you? - It's fine, Blinov Pass me your cigarette Why? So I can light up Of course, hang on a second So, Semenych? Did you tell him to go fuck himself? In those exact words? Yes. Did you? - In those exact words? - Have you done it or not? I'm asking you for the last time Wait a second I'm not waiting a second, I've already asked you twice Has he apologised to you? It was part of the contract - You want the whole thing? - The price is going up Fuck his mood. I need him to say sorry, now What happened? Blinov, I'm telling you, you need to say sorry now Come on, Blinov, say you're a prick, and wrong I'm a prick and completely wrong Be honest, were you right? Of course not Honestly? Honestly. How could I be right? He's lying. Be honest - Honestly, I was a prick - Very good, Blinov Explain what you were wrong about About everything Alright Apology accepted And your line, Semenych Blinov Go fuck yourself They've really fucked me off, you know Let's go to bed Or do you feel like talking with your colleagues? No, I don't Then let's go to bed Where is Olya? Upstairs? And Dima? Upstairs too? Just went up I don't like this, actually This situation I agree with you Dasha isn't behaving herself She's not nice to everyone here Always interrupting Always rude Yes She got what was coming to her We need to sort it out Dasha, why do you allow yourself to do these things? Dasha - I don't want to talk about it now - Why do you? Why do you talk to people the way you do? What makes you think you have the right to do it? Right now I'd like to talk to my husband, in this room Ira, I have a suggestion I've already heard your suggestion, Semenych So what do you think of it? Could Dasha answer my question? The only question I care about Why does Dasha allow herself to behave like this? I need nothing more from you After that you can discuss whatever you want That's the question I care about Would you like to talk about it now? Yes, I would And I don't want to, Ira. It's our room - Why do you talk to my husband like this? - Ira, this room is... This is a communal flat Answer my question... - No communal-living type hysteris please - Ira this is our room Can you answer my question now? Then I'll leave your room - No. No, I can't - Why? - And that's another question - Why? - Ira, that's it - Why, Dasha? No comment Right now I don't want to It's not like I'm asking you some horrible kind of question I'd like to talk to my husband in our room now And you are interrupting We hardly have any private problems here The question I'm asking you is absolutely elementary, Dasha - Yes, you're asking me - Why do you behave like this? Ira, I have a big favour to ask Let's discuss this more rationally In a more structured way... No, wait When someone is being rude to my husband who deserves better, I think He came to ask how you were. You, personally Why does Dasha interfere and start being rude? And then Blinov apologises to her. What for? That was my question Why should Blinov apologise to you? - What for? - Let's do a simple thing For your own behaviour, Dasha? Everyone has their own private space If you want to discuss it, let's go to the living room It's a better place to have this chat It's a communal flat, you're not the only one living here Let's go to the living room You're right, Olya That space really is communal Semenych, may I have a word? I'll pour you some tea Dasha, come and join us Come and join us here, it concerns you too Dasha, do you want to come out here? No, I just want a word with you Excuse me for a minute Dasha, what's going on? Please, Dasha I can't You don't have to do anything I don't want you to do it Why not? Because it was an ultimatum To drop everything now and go sort out the problem Dasha, let me tell you this I have no energy to fight now I understand But a complaint has been made Well, we'll consider We agreed that I'd go to bed and you'd sit with me I would, but certain complaints have been raised The complaints can wait I really don't want to have a fight with you now I know Me neither Let's do something to make sure we don't have a fight Agreed Have you got any ideas? I've got an idea. Let's go to bed Yes. I have no other ideas anyway - We can go somewhere. Would you like to? - No I don't want to go anywhere. Let's go to bed Let's go to bed All this is making me really sad Does saying, "it comes from the gauge theory" mean there is a point in the space where we see it as a gauge theory? A two-dimensional equivalent would be a 2.2 conformal theory. It's locally geometric It comes from the manifold. Am I right? Absolutely Semenych. That's next X used to belong to this sum M was an element of that space R was an irreducible representation That was the representation we had. That's where x sits It's a superfield theory It's a field on the variables x defined locally on sigma and on these four anticommuting variables How do you define it in these terms? The equivalent of this correspondence? Yes. What is it? You want to think up the dualisation for any integrable system? You can put it into words but there's no better description than manifold operators There's Polishchuk-Rothstein Wait, Semenych - It's an important question - Semenych knows the answer We should tell him. If he'd known he wouldn't have asked Of course I won't share the details of my PhD with you, Semenych, sorry Right, we need some plates, Olya Cheese, sausage, sausage, cheese It turned out well. It was all wrong. None of it was ever published So what if it's wrong? So nothing. I'm happy with it So what if it hasn't been published? It's good it hasn't been published What matters is, it came out fine, right? Look, tell me: do you respect yourself as a scientist? Be honest. Just say: I do I try not to think in these terms, otherwise I'd probably kill myself Why? No one reads me, Semenych No one reads, bastards People read him though Whereas I write badly and unclearly That's not quite true What, don't people read you? Semenych wanted to object about me writing well and clearly I want to say something What's the fucking difference? If they read it, it must be clear Alright then, they retell it. There are people able to retell it No, I was just lucky to find a niche, so to speak where some people are interested... Listen, come off it. You're in a leading position in that niche - Sorry? - You're in a leading position - No - Who is in the leading position then? No one. There are no leading positions here Yes there are, because there's a trademark Look, but it's always... It's Nekrasov's ABB this, Nekrasov's ABB that... It's important ABB what? I mean, certain stuff by Nekrasov and certain other stuff by Nekrasov Well, actually, you know if you look at it from a different angle you'll see that, really different groups have worked on this Yes Nekrasov was just lucky he got to put a little doodle in there somewhere In six different places at the same time It could have been called Semenych-Nekrasov - It could never have been Semenych - Why? Because Semenych has been resisting that all his life - I don't think he does anymore - What? - He doesn't anymore - It's too late now First, he still resists. Just look at him He does, yes he does No, Semenych is hopeless There's an article by Semenych, ten years ahead of the rest So what? Does anyone remember it? Little rats, Semenych Not a fucking thing. Semenych, where are you? There you are You merged into the background I just remembered how it was our cat's birthday - We gave her a mouse - Yes I brought it from the lab Yes, and... Did the cat say "meow"? It's not about the cat, but the mouse It ran away? It was washing itself Semenych still can't forgive himself Of course I can't The mouse was in a glass jar with a lid The cat was prowling around it but the little mouse was just washing itself What did you do? What did you do? I couldn't wash myself like that Yes, but what did you do? Did you give the mouse to the cat? Of course, it was the cat's birthday As for the mouse, it was... It was deathday That proves that life is stronger than death I have a theory, Semenych, that I wanted to ask you about Is there any truth in this? When everything is clear and calm, you see your direct path, and you know how it ends - We all know how it ends - Dasha, you are too smart Keep silent, please You are only nervous when you don't see your path That's what life is If your path is direct, it means death right away As you see where it ends Semenych, remind me what Bryusov called us Pan... something? What? Not Mongoloid, but Pan-? Pan-Slavism No, Pan- What else could it be? It has something to do with Pan-Turkic You mean The Scythians? That's Blok Blok, of course No, it was Bryusov You mean his epigraph? Yes It goes, "Pan-Slavism, though it sounds fierce it's pleasing to my ear" That's it So it's Pan-Slavism Pan-Slavism? Yes Then it goes "Millions are you and the hosts are we And we shall war if you want, take heed Yes we are Scythians- leafs of the Asian tree Our slanted eyes glow bright with greed" [And before everything happened I had a reaction...] You've done your job, Semenych You've put in your two pennyworth, you can go There's a good little boy You're going to bed, aren't you? Yes, why? Tell me you don't want to Tell me you want to have a fucking chat with Nekrasov Why would I say that? - So I have to guess? - Why? We're not all as perceptive as you Say "I don't want to sleep" Can you stamp your foot and say "I don't want to go to bed"? "Fuck off. I want a fucking chat with my Nekrasov" Why are you being confrontational? I'm just off to bed, calmly and quietly Though when singing I'm not a bass I don't discriminate by race The language is familiar - It's messed up - Paul Robeson sings it Do you know how much time I spent on Paul Robeson Street? How much I fucking suffered there? It's not me. It's your own... Barges go along the Mississippi The barges go all day long The cotton has taken away all our strength The cotton has taken away our peace What's wrong? Nothing Why are you standing there? I'm thinking About what? Life? Yes Have you come up with anything? No. Should I have? I just assumed that if you're thinking then you might think something up, that often happens Of course I'm just taking it all in Taking you in Me? It's those boundaries again which you love speaking about Not quite, but fine What? I know you don't like all this Or rather, I know you don't like me like this No, Semenych, I like you What can I do? I actually do want to go to bed now. Really Let's go to bed then Because... Why are you down, Semenych? - I don't want another... - What? - You're upset, aren't you? - Yes. I don't want another... Why are you upset? You don't want to argue with me? - No, I don't. What's the point? - Let's not then Alright, Semenych, let's not argue, let's go to bed - Let's not argue - Because what's the point? - We can go and talk to Nekrasov - What for? So this is how I am You may like it or you may not Maybe, it's just a professional thing you don't understand But in theoretical physics it's important to understand other worlds The more you understand them, the more you enrich yourself When a person outlines his philosophy I try to understand it The same is in science. A person demonstrates his world, and I accept it - And I grasp these axioms, and then... - Develop them? - Yes, I develop these axioms - That's why Nekrasov is an academician - And you are a fucking shit - There you go again - You don't think there's such effect? - No, I don't - Some create new worlds, some develop them - Developing other worlds When will you write about your tao theory? As soon as I get down to it Somebody else will do it. You'll explain it... I've already explained it - ...so that they can easily understand - Again in theoretical physics it's important to understand other people - Yes, Semenych, I got it - If I don't do it, it's bad So. If the system excludes love We must exclude it too I'm quite simple Nothing is simple I'm trying to find more ascetic things than what's happening behind our backs now Fedya, we love you too We love you so much It's not about love. Do you respect me? Fedya, I've always respected you Do you fucking respect me? I do, I fucking respect you, you cunt There's no respect No, there is respect, there's just no cunt I don't have the mentioned equipment installed Ministry of Internal Affairs Please Where's Nekrasov? Which is his room? He's away When is he expected back? What was the purpose of his trip? Work Is this a search or just an inspection? We're taking a look at the room He lived here And no one lives here now? Did he go far? I don't actually know He has a lot on and... I don't have permission to know where he's gone Really? Yes You don't work together? Sometimes we do Are these are just his personal things? So there are no documents here? You don't know? Bogdan, give us a hand There's no need What are you doing here? Just curious Are you mad? Get out of here Get some rest May I have a glass of water? May I have a glass of water? Here you are There aren't any other glasses - Winelass or cup? - A wineglass? How nice Thank you You're welcome Have a good night Good night, comrades Good night What happened? What's the matter? Could you leave so we could talk? I don't think that's a good idea Women always understand each other Dasha dear Which of us do you want to leave? Look at me, please Just for a second Go away, Olya Go away I want to calm you down with cold water I'll just wash you No You'll feel better Olya, I said no Don't touch me, get the fuck out of here I want to help Fuck off, you too Is that what you want? Give it here Olya, please Can't you see? Can't you see what's going on? Calm down, Dasha Don't touch me Don't touch me What are you doing? - Don't touch me - Don't go outside, please If you want, we can get dressed and go out I can't. That's it You must Dasha dear, calm down Calm down Dasha, cool down. Quiet Quiet Dasha, be quiet Easy now, Dasha Fuck What is it? What is it? It's all fine Yes, Olya, it's all just great Olya, can you leave? Could you please leave? Can you leave, Olya? What do you think you're doing? - Let go of me - What are you doing? What the fuck do you think you're doing? I can see what you're doing Please don't What? I was here with you What is it? Save me I'm here, that's what I'm trying to do Do you understand? That's what I'm trying to do I've only been trying to save you All I've been doing. Dasha Please, I'm right here I'm saving you Alright, we'll get dressed and leave at once - I'm going to dress you - I can't I'll dress you and we'll leave Take me away Take me away I am, Dasha Why won't you let go of me? I'm trying to dress you No How can I get you out? How? How can I get you out of here? Take me away - I'm trying to take you away - Don't touch me - I'm not touching you - Take me away - What do you want me to do? - I can't. Take me away from here - Take me away - That's what I'm doing - That's what I'm doing - Don't touch anything But I can't get you out of here like this. Do you understand? - No - How do you want to do it? - I can't - Dasha dear, please Don't touch me - Take me away - There, there - Let go of me - Dasha, I'm taking you away from here - Do you understand? - No. Don't touch me anymore I'm not going to touch you anymore, I'll just save you, and won't touch you anymore All I want is to achieve one thing, you see I'll save you and won't touch you if you don't want me to Do you understand? Do you? There you are There. Please count and check it Of course Count and check it, please I was watching your hands - You were? - Yes Goodbye, thank you - Will you wait? - Of course Dima Kaledin Please count it It's in 20s and 25s Do you have anything larger? - No, they're all gone - All gone? Fine Alright then Please count it carefully Don't leave until you do Here is 2000 I only have these And a few larger ones Please count it. There are 80 notes there That's all I have left
