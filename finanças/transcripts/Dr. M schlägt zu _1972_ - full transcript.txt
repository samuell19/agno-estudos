Go ahead. What are you waiting for? John, come over here. The girl from across the street is being kidnapped. John. We've got to do something. Nonsense. You read too many crime novels. This man's name is Cranko, Dr. Cranko. A criminal organisation has commissioned him to obtain secret documents kept at the McDowell Institute for Laser Technology. Said documents contain plans for the construction of a new super weapon that sends deadly laser rays to Earth via satellite and is capable of destroying vast areas of land. We got hold of a female assistant from the institute. I'm certain that she can show us the way to the documents. We just have to treat her properly, and that's going to be your task. I've brought something new along from Europe. If we inject her this hypnotic drug, she'll tell you absolutely everything she knows, you have my word for it. Very good, Hermann. They should arrive here any moment. Have another look at the controls. Right away. Now, tell me precisely what you did. You were informed about this crime three hours ago. First I went to the flat and had a look around. I was hoping to find some traces but no such luck. Are you saying you haven't even interrogated the girl who informed us about the crime yet? I decided that the investigation of the crime scene was more urgent. That girl and her statement weren't going anywhere. Besides, she's already made a statement over the telephone. I can't do much more investigating this business. Ask the girl to come to your office and interrogate her. Got it? Don't play the great detective, you're still half-baked, my boy. Back to work. Why not sack me right now if I'm not good enough? Then you can deal with this mess yourself. I'll think it over. No, I'm sorry... There he is, hold on. A call for you. It's your fiancée. You want to talk to her? Here. - No. - Fair enough. After all, I'm on duty. As you wish. None of my business. It's your fiancée, not mine. Don't talk such rubbish. Yes, who's speaking? Paganini. We spoke this morning about that dreadful abduction. I tell you sheriff, I'm all mixed up. The whole thing has upset me terribly. Well, I was wondering whether I should pay you a visit today? Don't I have to appear in court or whatever it is? When can you get here? - This afternoon. - No sooner? No, I'm frightfully sorry but I have to see my doctor first. Excuse me, my kettle is whistling. How can anyone solve a case under these circumstances? The drug's effect should show in a moment or two. She's been unconscious for two hours, Herrmann. I warn you, if you've given her too much. I assure you I didn't, doctor. She'll become conscious any moment now. Good. Then switch it on. Can you hear me? She's awake, but it'll take a moment before she's fully conscious. That bloody stuff seems to have had quite an effect. Can you hear me? Do you understand? Herrmann, if you've made a mistake... If she doesn't become conscious, it's over. Now, Doctor. You will answer my questions. The institute... There are plans... The blueprints for the new weapon. You know where they're kept, don't you? - Plans. They will be... - Yes, go on. They will be? - Moved. - When and where? Tomorrow morning at six o'clock. - From the institute? - Tomorrow morning at six. - How many guards? - Two. How is the car secured? Answer. It's useless. She won't say any more now. Everything's fine. We're nearly there. They've pumped out the gas. What weird kind of mist is that? No idea. Just a moment. It's going to take them a few hours to notice the switch. That may be. But won't the driver report the layover? He will, but not in time. And we're not easy to find here. I've never experienced anything like that. - What happened? - I'm sure I don't know. Come on, let's get going- Firstly, we'll cross the border into Mexico. Once we're there, we'll receive further instructions. I suppose they'll send somebody... to pick up the plans and pass them on to the headquarters. But... there's something which could bring us serious trouble. I hope I'm wrong, but the plans might be encrypted. In that case, we'll have to find the code first. And that could mean all of our work here has been in vain. And in two days time, this place will be crawling with CIA agents- If the plans need to be decrypted, it'd be better to cancel the whole enterprise. Are you mad? We'd pay for that with our heads. We proceed as planned. I'm sure the code will be kept somewhere at the institute. Aren't you a master of blackmail? Think of something. Start looking for a suitable victim now. I believe there's a certain scientist called Orloff... One of the leading men in the field. - It worked even better than I'd expected. - Very good. - Well, ask her in. - A marvellous girl. A stripper. I bet that body of hers will get you going. Be nice to her. You never know. - Shut up and get her in here, Melou. - Will do. I'll go. - Here we are. Come in, Madam. - Good afternoon. - It's hot in here. - Please, take a seat. What's your name? Now listen, sheriff. I've already told you all that on the phone. - I mean, it was you I spoke to, right? - Just tell me again. Actually, that's not my birth name but the surname of my husband. Or rather, the man I live with. You see, we thought: What do we need that official contract for? We can just live together anyway and perhaps be even happier that way. His surname's Paganini, although he isn't a pianist. Sorry to spoil your enthusiasm but Paganini wasn't a pianist. Well, whatever. He's fiddling about with other things though. And believe me, he's masterful at it. Just brilliant. Would you tell me your real surname? Well, believe it or not, my birth name is Herring. What can I do? I inherited it from my father, alas. Though everybody says he wasn't really my father at all. All that gossip. - So your full name is Jennifer Herring? - If you insist, yes. - Profession? - Artist. Isn't that obvious? What kind of artist? Well alright, I'm part of a cabaret and... Why don't you come and visit me sometime? What do you do there? A little of everything, really. All quite decent, of course. Stripping can be an art in its own right. And the more I show, the more earn. Sounds like you're making quite a living out of it. Yes? Quite so, sheriff. I'm glad to hear that. Which cabaret are you performing at? Well, in two days I'll be starting at a new place, a posh one, exclusively furnished, everywhere. And what's it called, this cabaret? 'The Red Garter'. Now, where were you during the night in question? Which night? When you made your observation. That night. I was at home- Were you sleeping? Sort of... I was with John and you know, when I'm with John, it's like a volcano. I had just put on a rather delicious negligee... Spare me your bedroom affairs, will you? Am I making you nervous, sheriff? Not the way you think. Now, would you please just answer my questions? But sheriff. It sounds like you're cross with me. So, you saw the kidnapper? On the street? You were in the house? And you were looking out of the window? Of course, but only after I heard screams. It was horrifying. I heard the screams and jumped out of bed to see what was going on. What I saw was inconceivable... A hideous monster. And it carried an unconscious girl in it's arms. I see. The gentlemen from the police aren't made of stone after all. What happened next? Let me see... It was very dark, I couldn't make out much, you know? - Is that all? - Well, if you ask me like that. I told John, but he misunderstood me... Well, he was quite exhausted, but I managed to rouse him one more time. Do you remember what time it was? We went to bed at ten. Then we had a longer session because John had been away and starved for two weeks. After that, it was about... fifteen... or maybe... Possibly... Considering how long he'd been away... Anyway, it was 1.24am. Good evening, sir. I'd like to hear what you've accomplished so far. Have you interrogated that girl? - So? No new leads? - Precisely. You won't despair, will you? Perhaps you're just a slow starter who will soon grab the newspaper headlines. The first case you solve could make you famous. Are you making fun of me, Mr. Crosby? - You'll solve the case. - But certainly not alone. You know we don't have a large police force here. You're wasting the chance of a lifetime. Bromer, please be reasonable. - What do you know about the case? - Just as much as you do. - A girl disappears without trace. - That's not unusual. - I gather she had some private trouble. - That's no reason to kidnap someone. There was a fight in her flat. Is that so? Women often appreciate getting kidnapped. Judging from the traces and the evidence, it must've been a superhuman creature. Well, I'm not sure if Frankenstein is around at the moment. - And the doors were locked from inside. - So were the windows. Dammit, you're not listening. Apparently, you're not taking this case seriously. But, sir, please. The only thing I can do is... question the dancer one more time. Now that's better. You'll see, she knows more than she's letting on. I'll squeeze her like a lemon. Very good, my boy. Do that. But don't be too rough. Let's clear out. We can't decrypt the blueprints without the code and we don't have time to get it now. Impossible, Leslie. We can't just leave. We need the code within two days, at all costs. Or the organisation, mercilessly, will have our heads served for supper. We'll manage, Leslie. We'll make it. There's only one small step separating us from success: One million dollars. You bloody cowards. Doctor, be reasonable, we've got no chance. Just admit it, I beg you. We kidnapped and killed a girl. In the States, they'd give us the electric chair for this. It won't be long before we have the CIA breathing down our necks. If everything had gone as planned, we would've left already, but now... I won't listen to this any longer. You want to kill us all. You've gone mad, doctor. Why should we risk our heads here? Doing other people's dirty work? Not even for two million dollars. I won't risk getting bumped off. We'll get bumped off either way. Our only chance is to get that code. Do you really believe we can quit just like that? They'd find us anywhere. Alright. How much time have we left, Doctor? Just two days. That's the most we have. If we get caught by the CIA, it's over. But they'll never get us. Now let's think this through. I see one possibility. We need to get it out of one of the scientists. Nobody gets in our way. Anyone who tries to stop us must die. You'll kill everyone, understood? But we shouldn't kill that strip dancer who testified to the sheriff. We might need her. Bring the girl here. But be a little more cautious this time, understood? We'll make her part of our plan. She has the looks to make a man talk. So, Leslie and Andros will grab the girl and you, Herrmann, will install bugs in Dr. Orloff's house. That won't be difficult. But I'd suggest you call him beforehand to check if he's home. If he is, lure him away. By the way, we don't need the sheriff's chief any more. Shouldn't we get rid of him? Alright, see to that after you've been to Orloff's. It's a kind of a shame about that man. He'd do a good deal more for money, doctor. - No, we don't need him any more. - As you wish- But he could control the sheriff for us a little longer. He knows too much about us and that's why you'll kill him. Alright, doctor. I'll arrange for him to get bitten by a rattlesnake. - Things like that can happen. - Excellent. You can trust me. As far as I know, snakes feel rather comfortable under warm bed sheets. - What's the matter with you? - I'm worried, that's all. If you keep putting your worries first, I'll have to find myself another man. Great. You can start looking right away, there are lots around here. - Your fault. Why did you fall for a policeman? - Because this policeman is a terribly nice policeman. - I'm sick of all this. - Darling, nobody can blame you. You're doing your best. Don't be angry, please. If they don't send me some people soon, I can have myself buried. But, Crosby won't do anything about it. That old oaf. But he's your superior, it's up to him to decide. - So you can stop worrying about it. - I've almost stopped now. Darling, just imagine: in three months, we'll be married. Yes. If I mess up this case, you'll have an unemployed husband. Perhaps I saved some money. I certainly hope so. Here, put this in your office. Perhaps it'll brighten your mood. See you later. - Melou, put this flower into a vase. - Are we opening a florist's now? If things keep going as they are, that wouldn't be such a bad idea. What's the matter with you anyway? Always sitting around with a sour face. You should get married sometime. I'd quite like that but I'm afraid my wife won't let me. - You're about to get hitched, right? - Probably. In three or four months. If I were you, I'd really give it a little more thought. By the way, Crosby wants to talk to you. He said that if you're not in his office within two minutes, he'll make mincemeat out of you. - What does the old fool want of me? - You'd better go in and ask him yourself. Nice. What are you doing here, Andros? Don't stare at me like that. Didn't I order you to stay in the house? You'll learn to obey me. You know what's expected of you. Go on back to the house. Now. Now. Move. If I'd gotten my hands on that girl in my heyday... She would've been due, I can tell you that. One can't even sit quietly here. There you are. Can I get you a drink? A peppermint cocktail. Why do you want that? Order a proper bottle of sparkling wine, you'll get more from it than caries. Alright, why not? By the way, I'd like to speak to Miss Jenny after the show. Now, will I get another drink or won't I, you waste of space? I don't like this. - You wanted to talk to me? - Please sit down for a moment. Well, I don't usually do that, you know? I liked your show. You know what the people want to see. - You think so? Thank you very much. - Yes. Enchanting. I always ask my husband for advice, you know? I'd like to meet him sometime. That can be arranged. But don't you want to tell me why you've come here? Yes. I'm a manager. You don't look like someone who cashes ten percent from poor artists. No, I don't believe it. I could do quite a lot for you, if you'd like me to. - For ten percent. - You think I'd waste money like that? If you let me help you, you'll earn so much that 10% will seem ridiculous. Do you want to put me under permanent contract? Of course. I'll give you a contract which guarantees you a salary of $100 per night. - Well, that would be fantastic. - You just need to sign. You'd have just lost a lot of money. Think how much such a wife costs. Jewellery, furs and all that. No, you have to send her on the streets. That's the way. You? A pimp? You wouldn't even win a flowerpot. Look. Our girl is just getting taken. Doesn't look very suspicious. Maybe she's doing it with a woman for a change. Hey. Pay attention. Come on, man, speed up. Come on. What can I do? It's an antique vehicle. What kind of answer is that? You want to be deputy without even owning a proper car? I'd like to know how you're spending the piles of money you have lying around. Did you say piles of money? I hope God's listening. I think I've had a few too many. Do we have far to go? No, we're almost there. You can sleep at my place if you want. Yes, I'll do that. Many thanks. Of course. Don't mention it. It's strange... My head is making these noises... You're a nice girl, I really like you. I like that. I'm sure it's going to be fantastic working with you. If I just imagine - 100 dollars... - Faster. Faster. - Take it easy - You don't want us to fly out of that bend, do you? This is wonderful. I'll fix it right away. I've got two tomato tins here. - Tomatoes? - No, they're filled with water. Damn. Don't worry, it'll only take a moment. Let's go for a drink. Hello? Where are you? Where have you gone? Where are you hiding? Where have you gone? Where are you? Look. Over there. The gun, Andros. Do it. Let go of me. Well, what do you think of the old swinger? She's just fabulous. I wish I knew where they were going. - Why are you wearing winter clothes? - Somehow, I'm always cold. You haven't been home much lately. Is something wrong at the institute? I shouldn't talk about it. But I'll give you a hint. One of our transport cars was attacked. And something very important was stolen. Strange. You've got such an incredible number of security staff. Yes, that may be so. But it seems as if we are dealing with professionals. But the police? Aren't they investigating? If you knew. Right now, the FBI and CIA are fighting over responsibility. Fortunately, the gangsters failed to steal the most essential item- Is it secret material? Do you think it's the work of spies? I mean, no-one else could use your work, right? No, of course not. But spies may have the necessary means. We are ready, doctor. Everything's prepared. Tonight, Orloff is going to meet a CIA man and a fellow scientist. We'll record their conversation. The girl may come in later. Possibly, we'll hear tonight where the code is kept and how to get it. Orloff won't talk about it, he's not that incautious. We'll see. Good evening, Professor Orloff. My name is Marx, CIA. Have a seat, Mr. Marx. Well now, Professor. To start with, we should try to get an overview of the whole issue. Documents were stolen. So we need to determine who might be interested in them. Well, basically, it could be any country antagonistic towards the US. Certainly, but you should've protected yourself from such eventualities. The blueprints are encrypted and they haven't got the code. So that means, without the code they can't use the blueprints? Probably not. But today, it's possible to have a computer calculate the system's options, though that's unlikely in the case of our system. What would happen if they do crack it? Would they be able to build the weapon? Naturally, yes. The blueprints match the latest stage of development. They contain all the details. If an antagonistic power managed to decrypt these plans, it would be catastrophic. So protecting the code isn't enough? Of course not, we must get the material back. They've probably already sent it out of the United States. We won't get anywhere like this, gentlemen. We need to focus on searching for possible sources of threat. Most likely a group of people who are backed by a large organisation. Let's focus on that group first because I believe they won't stop. We'll have to wait till they try and snatch the code, then we might be able to catch them. It wouldn't make sense for them not to try. You can't exercise pressure if you don't know the leverage. I'm afraid that waiting is all we can do to get the plans back. I hope you're aware of the risk we're taking? Tomorrow, I'll take the code from my safe - That's enough. - and hide it somehow. Kill Orloff and bring his niece here. Who are you? What do you want? Good evening, Orloff. We just came to bid you farewell. Uncle? Are you alright, uncle? - Why am I getting disturbed all the time? - Professor Orloff's niece. I see. Very good. You can never know. We'll keep her as security... until we've finished the mission. Give her an injection, Herrmann. Andros, take her upstairs. Didn't you hear? We're having no luck, old boy. I don't think we'll get a single fish out of this sink water. Do you, Carlos? We've seen better days, haven't we? Hey, look what we've got here, Carlos. Can you believe it? Have you ever seen something like this? You couldn't possible mistake this for a fish. It's strange... I'd really like to know what girl wore these. I wonder how you can lose something like this? And in that cold, too... Judging from their condition, I dare say these haven't been in the water for more than 3 or 4 days, Carlos. What do you make of that? Well, if I was like Sherlock Holmes I'd say that the girl either drowned or, perhaps, she was even murdered. Look at that, Carlos. Careful, don't eat it right away. You old thief. It's been so long since we had a proper supper. She's coming round. I used a smaller dose this time. What do you want? What? Something's wrong with her. You mean because she's so lucid? I gave her an additional serum that'll loosen her tongue even more. Listen carefully. Your only hope is to obey us. Doctor, be brief. It doesn't last long. Then why didn't you give her enough to last several hours? I don't understand you. - One more injection doesn't matter. - Too strong a dose could be hazardous. Well, all right, Hermann. Jenny. You'll now do everything I tell you to. Everything. Go to the Palace Hotel to meet Parkinson, and get everything about Orloff's project from him. And find out how far the CIA has progressed with their investigation. I'll be there as well to keep an eye on you. Parkinson? Yes... And to remind you... You'll pay for the slightest mistake with your life. So, your name's Paganini, is that right? Yes. You know, at first I wasn't worried because she often joins a customer after the show for a drink. But, till now, she always came home afterwards. I mean, she's not a tramp. It's all really quite decent, chief. Quiet. She didn't even call. There ought to be a way to find out where she is. Where were you at the time? Well, I was here waiting for Jenny all night. This afternoon, I drove to the club to see if she was at rehearsal. Jenny's very serious about her job, you know? She's never once been late. Never. She was supposed to be at the club at five and now it's nine. To be honest, I fear she might have been kidnapped like that other girl. Don't get dramatic. Maybe she stayed with a customer a little longer, overstrained herself, got tired and is now taking a little nap. Very funny. No, she'd never do something like that. Those swine kidnapped her, I'm absolutely sure of it. And you're sitting about doing nothing. Melou, drive to the club with Mr Paganini right away. Try and find out something about the girl. Alright. Let's go, son. They could've at least informed me that the CIA put me under personal guard. Yes, they could have. You understand that I'm not very happy to have you around all the time now. On the other hand, I'm aware that it cannot be avoided. The death of your colleague Orloff proves that the gang will stop at nothing. It was Orloff's own idea to lure them with the code, hoping they'd make a mistake. In any case, Professor Parkinson, please don't do anything without informing me first. As you wish. But I don't think they'll try me. They'll know that I'm well guarded. Don't underestimate these people. They've got methods you couldn't even dream of. I don't underestimate them. I'm well aware of the danger and I will act accordingly, trust me. I'll just go and make a call. Please don't leave the hotel. Professor Parkinson? Excuse me, do I know you? - I know you, Professor. - My pleasure. May I sit down? I suppose you approached me for a reason, didn't you? Pretend that we're talking about something banal. I don't understand. What do you want from me? I believe I know. It's the Orloff project. Yes, Professor. What's your part, what do you want? To warn you. Parkinson speaking. Please give me Washington LE 27-43, quick. This is Professor Parkinson from the McDowell Institute. Just a moment ago, a woman who's apparently a member of the gang... Get out. Yes, my dear, you spend half your life waiting. Chief, there's some old man with a strange dog. - Who are you waiting for? - The chief. - Which chief? - But aren't you the chief? I'm not the chief but the sheriff You understand? Are you investigating the case of the girl that disappeared? Yes. Why? Because I have something to report which might help. Take a seat. - Can Carlos stay here? - Of course. Could I have one? Make a record of his statement. You want me to make a record of that man's babbling? You can't be serious. You'll do as I say, understood? I won't tolerate this much longer, Melou. You're just sitting on your fat ass without doing anything. - As you wish. - Let's leave that lighter here. Your name? I want to hear your name, not the name of your dog. But that is my name. The dog's name is Carlos. It's quite simple. It's like this. His name used to be Sultan and mine, Carlos. But we thought that was too ordinary and so we swapped. And you know what's funny? Ever since we did that, he's been much more obedient. And when he's done something naughty, I threaten to call him Sultan again- You wouldn't believe how he runs when I do that. Your surname? Haven't got one. Write: "Nameless"- I don't care what you write. Your profession, Mr. Sultan? Well, night-owl. What's that supposed to mean? Rather like a night watchman. I look after a gas factory by night, and I see that everything remains tidy and nothing gets stolen, you see? - You make sure nothing gets stolen? - Judging from his looks... Now, listen, there's no need to insult me just for a few drags. If you put an open tin before me, almost forcing it onto me, you mustn't be surprised. You didn't say "just one". Alright, alright- Let's move on. Actually I don't want to work at the factory any more, you know? They pay you shit and I need my freedom. I want to see the world. Nobody's objecting to that... But tell us now what you know about the case. Alright. I read about the girl in the newspaper, not that I could afford to buy one. I took it from the rubbish. Well, it was like this. Last night. I happened to be near the old lighthouse. Would you get to the point, please? I would if you didn't interrupt me all the time- I was about to tell you. Once again - It was dark and I was dozing there a little. Suddenly, I heard an engine noise. Carlos also must've smelt something. A real beagle. I'm not a coward, take my word for it. So I went up there and saw two men taking a girl out of a car. She was unconscious and didn't make a sound. It seemed a little fishy to me. Then I remembered the day before when I caught a trout. It was delicious. How is the trout related to the case? The trout isn't. But this is. - What's that? - If you want it, I'd like a reward. What kind of reward? The rest of the cigarettes in that tin. That's not much. Alright. It's a deal. What's that? I'm no Casanova but even I can see that those are woman's knickers. Pretty, aren't they? Quite new, too. I fished them out of the river. I've no idea what to make of them. I can not believe this. I kept it specially, as evidence. I wanted to be of help to you. Stop. My lighter. - My cigarettes. - My lighter first. Alright, there you are. I wouldn't like to keep something from you. In that case, why not put the cigarettes back? That's entirely different. Do you want me to type this nonsense up or shall just I throw it away? - Type it up. - Well, whatever... We've got approximately half an hour for the operation. When the watchmen check the other side of the institute. But I'm afraid we'll have to knock off the porter. We can only hope that nobody will come into the hall at that moment. During and after the operation, there must be complete radio silence. - Is that clear? - Clear- Good. Over. Riccardo. Take care of the old fellow. Meanwhile, we'll go upstairs and prepare everything. I don't understand... The cable. How could this have happened? You were careless. You'll pay for it. Go downstairs, now. Please. Help me. I'll try. Why are we being held here? Get the police... Please... You will obey me. Take the girl downstairs. Do you hear me? Take her downstairs. You know the horrible things I can do to you. Obey, Andros. Obey. What are you waiting for? Downstairs with her. We have to kill him. - Our men won't be fast enough to... - Don't worry. With a helicopter... In any case, we should notify the local police. They're closer to it. - But the sheriff is completely helpless. - We've got no choice, what can we do? All we can do is wait. I've prepared a report for the Ministry of Defence. They'll give us hell and we can forget about promotion. We'll see. If we do catch the gang, it'll all look quite different- You're an optimist. What can go wrong? We've sent out twenty men, that ought to be enough. Hello, Richards speaking. Naturally. Of course we did. I'll come right over. - The big boss wants to see me. - Well, enjoy yourself. Keep me informed, will you? Stay where you are, Andros. Stand still. Andros. Help me... Jenny, darling. Wonderful. It's enough to make me cry. Shoot, blast you. Are you all right? Johnny, it was awful.
