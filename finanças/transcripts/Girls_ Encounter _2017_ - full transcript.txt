The probability of meeting someone with a connection to you is 1/240,000. The probability that you become friends is 1/240,000,000. And the probability you meet your best friend is 1/2,400,000,000. GIRLS' ENCOUNTER You're at a sensitive age. As you age, go through puberty, you experience many new things. One topic we avoid is any kind of mental disturbance. But this could afflict anyone. One example is an inferiority complex while growing up. It brings feelings of inferiority, as if the grass is greener elsewhere. Under such pressures, some people deliberately hurt themselves. Let me give you an example. Wrist-cutting, though I know no one here does it. This self-mutilation balances out the mental conflict. Multiple piercings can also be one mode of expression. Others adorn their bodies with tattoos. All are expressions of the desire to change. An eagerness to change oneself without really knowing how to. Those with low self esteem are prone to these practices. Right, Ms Obara, continue from there. No need to stand. We need the help of others when times become difficult. That's when we need to consult with family and friends. I think you'll be better off at a public university near home. Or any college you can attend from here. It's safer and easier to find a career path. Kaori's Mom said she'll enroll at the local public university. That's probably best for you, too, Miyuri. Here. Yes, yes. Hello? Yes, how are you? Tsumugi's Room The character for silkworm uses both "heaven" and "worm." Do you have a girlfriend? Is she older than you? Silkworms are a purely human construct. They're domesticated creatures which cannot survive without human input. Together, the characters for "domesticate” and "silkworm" mean "sericulture.” As for feeding silkworms... Which one? Answer me. What's that? These are silkworms. We talked about spinning cocoons earlier. How the cocoons become silk. Humans have adapted these creatures for our needs. Let's take a look at an actual silkworm cocoon. Put them to your ear then shake. I can hear it rattling. That's right. The actual silkworms are inside the cocoons. Are they alive? Yes, they are. We boil the cocoons to kill the worms to make the silk. We only need the cocoons, not the animal itself. It's all just useless junk. Look, her purse. Are you okay? Say something. What's this? Tsumugi? What is it? How long will you be stuck in this tiny little box? Poor thing. Let me introduce you to the big, wide world. Your little friend is gone. Gone forever. So wake up. Now she looks like a worm. Let's go. Are you okay? Hey. You can have mine. Our newest classmate is Tsumugi Tomita, from Tokyo. Let's welcome her here. I'm Tsumugi Tomita. Pleased to meet you. Right, Ms Tomita. Go take a seat. That's the right answer. Let's go to Question 4. We've got a birthday present for you. Here. Open it up. It's delicious. Let's see you eat it. You'll love it. We got it just for you, so eat it all up. Come on, open up. What the hell? Do you always run away like that? Do you really think you're worthless? You're just here, like air. Close your eyes, then wake up. Nothing ever changes. You feel nothing. Who do you live for? Why are you even alive? You can end it all, you know. In an instant. With just one cut. What? If you've something to say, then say it. If you keep silent, no one will ever understand. What is it that you want? Are you happy all shut-in like this? Like a dead person? I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I want to live. I want to live. I'll find what's good in you. Feel. Feel your ears, nose, tongue and skin. Accept it with all your senses. What you see is not everything. I've been with you for all this time. What's your type, sir? I'm not telling you. Let's go. The rain's not stopping. What? What is it? Why? Why are you trying to help me? Did you know that insects have no sensation of pain? They can't feel pain. You know why? 3, 2, 1. Time's up. Because they soon die. Pain has no function when they have such short lives. It would be pointless for them to feel pain. But listen. Ouch. Your life has real value. I've always wanted to be friends with you. But I was scared. I thought if I got close to you, you'd disappear. It's always been like that for me. Never forget that I'll always be by your side. I've always wanted to be your friend. And I've wanted to be with you, too. A long time before you even thought of it. So you really are Tsumugi? Yes, I am. I'm Tsumugi. Here. Matching phones. Because I always want to be your number one. Shall we head back to school? Where it's so claustrophobic you can't breathe. Don't worry, there's no rule about keeping you in a box. Have you decided? Give me a second. Hurry it up. 3, 2, 1. Excuse me. We'll have a pudding parfait, pizza toast and spaghetti, please. Anything else? What's this? You've never had it? It's the most delicious drink in the world. Okay, that then. And 2 cream sodas. You're hopeless. What are you doing? You shouldn't. No, not for me. This is cute. Please don't. Hey, you two! Drink? Thanks. What is this? Alcohol? Are you filming? It looks delicious. Awesome. What do you like the most? The most? I don't know. Really? What about you, Tsumugi? Cream sodas, the corner of my room and my family. What kind of person are you? Normal. Just an ordinary person. What kind of person are you, Tsumugi? What do you think? You're strong and you have a sparkle. You're free and you're noble. You're a special person. What if I said I'm the total opposite? Total opposite? I'm weak, I have all kinds of problems. I'm not at all free and I'm very dirty. No, you're definitely wrong there. Why say that? To me, it's like you're... You're almost like a god. There are no gods. What's this? Can I? What's with these photos? Is that you? Yes. Where were they taken? At Hakone, I think. On vacation? Lucky you. I bet that was fun. But look closely. Not once did you smile for the camera. You're always pulling faces. Didn't you enjoy it? No. I don't like my family very much. Why not? The only thing we share is a bloodline. Mom and Dad are always fighting. I wonder why they even got married. Having me was probably just an accident. I don't feel... don't feel my parents really need me. You asked me why I stepped in to help you. I used to be like you, so I couldn't just leave you. Do you dislike your family, too? No, they're precious to me. Were you bullied? Not at all. Then what do you mean? I feel as if I could grab it. It looks so beautiful from here. But if you do grab it, it turns out messy. Looks good? It's so big. The whole world is so much bigger. I get that. Shall we go? You always carry this travel guide with you. So let's go. But... Okinawa Travel Guide Such a beautiful ocean and clear skies. Orange colored fish. Those amazing roof ornaments. Massive whales. White beaches. Pineapples and bitter melons. It's suffocating being in such a small space. Let's run away together. It's too tiny, too restrictive. No wonder we feel suffocated. Let's escape from this prison. It's so cramped. Run away together. What is that? Okinawan pork ribs. Really? Look at this. A pig's head. They actually eat it? They're Japanese, too. But they're so different. That's right. The world is so vast. Hey. Oishi Rinzan? What's that? Nothing. But why did you hide it from me? Why? Is it something special? You read it wrong, it's called the Great Stone of Rebirth. What's the stone of rebirth? Is it a shape, like a giraffe? No, it's a massive stone. They say it's the rock of reincarnation. There's a big hole in the middle. If you pass through 3 times, you'll be reborn. On the first pass, you discard any bad past events. The 2nd pass resets everything. On the 3rd pass, you can be reborn. What do you want to be reborn as? A good, decent person. I'll buy this one. We can read it together after school. Oh, sorry. Is that you, Obara? She's changed! Obara? No way! - She's so cute. - You look different. She looks stunning. That's a much better look. - That hair suits you. - Who cut it? The hair salon? I cut it. Really? I didn't know you two were friends. Now you look totally super-cute. So pretty. Cut my hair, too. She looks great. Have this. Vegetables. We need vegetables. Thanks. Is something wrong? No, we've just never seen you so talkative. I like the new you. Me, too. That looks great. Can I have it? Thanks. Wow, that's delicious. Who made it? Say cheese. When will we go? Summer? Yes, in the summer holidays. What? We have college entrance exams. Will you go to university, Miyuri? Most of my friends will. If you want a good job, you need a university degree. Does a good job give you anything special? I suppose it does. Like what? Well, for example... You can earn a good salary. That will help to make for stability. Then I can have a good, normal life. What's a good, normal life? You know, like everyone else. Like everyone else, huh? Between a life like everyone else, or a life you choose yourself. Which would you take? How much to travel to Okinawa? Probably very expensive. Maybe about 100,000 yen? ($US890) Don't you want to go now? No, I'll go. Because... Because what? I promised you I would. Right. And it was your idea from the start. It sure was. Listen. I've got another promise for you. What? This trip, we have to keep it a secret. We can't tell anyone. No friends, teachers, or parents. Why? Because that makes it more exciting. I'm already excited now. It's our secret. We can never tell anyone else. Hey. What are you two doing here? Studying for the exam. "The room is getting dark and Gregor is a..." What does that say? Corpse. Right. I know you can read it. I'm just testing if my daughter can read it or not. Okay, okay. What is it? He's your dad? Yes, my father. How do you do? Are you two classmates? Yes, we are. Great. I was concerned about her making friends at a new school. Please take good care of her. So high schoolers today read Franz Kafka? Have you finished work for today? Yes, just now, so I'm on my way home. I see. I'll go back with Dad then. Why? What about studying? It's okay. We'll do it tomorrow. Okay, let's go. I see you still love cream soda. What's wrong with that? Let me pay. Great. Thank you very much. You don't wear make-up? No, not really. You should. Try this lipstick. Chin up. There's Tsumugi. She's always late. Look at that. So pretty. Really cute. Such beautiful, fair skin. Good looking. Good morning. Morning. Chatting up the teacher, eh? About the exams. Really? I thought he's your lover. He is cute. Do you fancy him? I don't think so. She's tough. You love him! To be honest, I think he's... Here. That suits you better. I hate exams. I'm not ready for the test! You're too lazy. You should study more. Be more like Miyuri. I don't see you studying. I'm not going to university. That's enough talk. Eat up. Let's do it. How are you doing? Me? Not so good. I need more stimulation. I'm doing good. Because you look for men on the internet. It's a forum, not a dating site. Same thing. No way. They're totally different. What about you, Miyuri? About what? You know what I mean. Yeah. Really? What's he like? He has fair skin and a straight nose. Sounds good-looking. Which actor does he resemble? Do you have a photo? Not on me. You have to show us next time. I bet he's handsome. I'd gladly swap boyfriends. I want to change my boyfriend. What all this about? Miyuri's boyfriend. Let's wrap this up. Get back to studying. Don't be shy. It's great to have someone special. When someone loves only you, life is so beautiful. I totally agree. What about you, Tsumugi? You have a boyfriend? No, I don't. Really? Seriously? I was sure you'd have one. I don't. Have you done it before? Done what? You know, sex. Yes. Of course she has. Did it hurt? Not really. I don't remember it so well. I guess not. Once you've finished, hand in your test. Don't forget to put your name. Make sure you do it properly. This process breaks down feces and urine. Put together, it's called trophic level. You got that? Yes, sir. Thank you very much. You're a good student, so I was worried about you. Cute, aren't they? Why use such tiny spaces, sir? Can't we open them up? No, don't do that. They're now spinning their cocoons. Without these dividers, the threads would get tangled. The frames are there to prevent that. If they get too close, do they get ruined? Yes, they're quite a complicated animal to keep alive. They need our help. Some people say that they're ugly. Only because they don't know them well. When you don't know something, you can say anything. But that just means they're ignorant. You love insects, don't you, sir? Another way to say I'm weird. I didn't mean that, sir. You're a good girl Obara. The only student I can talk to. Really? No, there's one more, Ms Tomita. Did you know that insects can't feel pain? They say that insects have no sense of pain. Unlike we humans, they don't have feelings of fear, or pain. I envy them. I don't see the need for negative feelings of fear. And I hate pain, too. Are you sure about that? Sir? Next class. Go back to your classroom. I'm sick of studying. I want to go away. Look, after the exam, it's summer vacation. Summer vacation? Yes, summer holidays! Let's do it! What about the entrance exam? Don't say that. Let's go away somewhere. Somewhere tropical. Like where? - Beach? - A festival? Yes! Let's do that. Will you slim down by then? I want to wear a summer kimono. Want to see something good? What's with her? Here she goes again. Look! Okinawa! Let's go to Okinawa! But first, study. Don't be so serious. Just for a couple of days. - Like a treat. - Fantastic! Okinawa is too far. Why not go to Tokyo instead? That's no big deal. Think, one is 3 hours away by train. The other is only accessible by airplane - it's no contest! Not me, I have to study. What's with you? Are you scared of Okinawa? Were you attacked by animals there? No, nothing like that. Because of your boyfriend? No, I'm going to Okinawa with my family. Okay, I guess. We can't afford it, anyway. Hakone will have to do us. I wanted to go Okinawa. A hot spring in Hakone. Future Plan & Career Path Miyuri. Tsumugi. I trusted you. We promised not to tell anyone. I thought you weren't like the others. You've got it wrong. You'll lose your value if you keep that up. I'm kidding. I'm not mad at you. Going to Okinawa together is our secret. Above all, I trust you. That's all. See you. Leaving so soon? Yes, why? We haven't walked home together recently. Sorry, I've been busy lately. Really? Sorry, see you. You're going to Okinawa with her, aren't you? I'm jealous. When did you two get so close? We used to be really close, didn't we? Remember eating fried octopus balls together? You always said they were really delicious. But your face said the exact opposite. That face you used to pull was so funny. It's so much faster on a bike. Hey. This is her, isn't it? - Get off my case. - What's she up to? So you found me. Are you shocked? Look at your face. What's going on? These? They're dolls. Dolls? Yes, dolls. I sell them here. What? What do you mean? I just told you. I turn them into dolls, then sell them. A woman's only value is her body. You know that. So I empty their bodies and then I sell them. Isn't that great? And besides, it's very profitable. These are just empty shells. They're like containers. Like fixed assets. You know what? I've never really understood personality assessments. Why did you go out with him? His looks didn't attract me, but his character did. Is that even possible? Why do we get so attached to our feelings and emotions? They only make things more complicated. The thing about humans... If you let them, they'll only get dirtier. Such dark, dirty creatures. That's why I emptied them out. To make them pure, so I can sell them. Are you scared? But you're just like them. You can change your appearance, but you can't fool them. Why didn't you come and help me back then? Back when? I waited for you. All alone, for so long. I have something important to tell you tomorrow. Shhh. You over-reacted. Sorry. Well? What is it? Okay, listen. There's something that I have to tell you. I wanted to, but I couldn't. Okinawa Travel Itinerary We promised we'd go, but that wasn't realistic enough. So it's about Okinawa? What did you think it was? Nothing. Go on, tell me. If we leave tomorrow evening... Tomorrow? What about the exam? We'll skip it. But it's only a month until summer vacation. I can't wait that long. What about the money? Where did you get so much money? Okay? So here's my plan. After school, on the 27th, we take a train to Tokyo. That'll take about 3 or 4 hours. Then we'll head to the airport. And fly to Okinawa. Seriously? Sure. Here's your ticket. Don't lose it. Remember our promise? See you later. Tsumugi's Room If the worms cut the fiber, the silk will be ruined. So we need to boil the cocoons to kill the pupas. Now put your cocoons into the boiling water. You're late again. Everyone, hold on. I'll explain it again for our latecomer. The silkworm cocoon consists of a single thread. If the worm matures inside the cocoon and breaks out, it will ruin the thread. So we need to boil them alive inside the cocoon. You got that? Okay, now put your cocoons into the boiling water. Switch off the gas. Are you okay? Stay here while we go to the sickbay. Let's go. Stay quiet and do self-study till I get back. Come on, Tomita. You should be cooling that scald. Or it'll hurt more. It'll leave a scar. Were you not well today? Is it your period? Sometimes I get the same symptoms. I get irritated and can't control myself. The silkworms are inside the cocoons. It's okay to boil them. Insects don't feel pain. Silk worms! Do you know what they grow up to be? Thread? They're great, they make silk for us. They turn into moths. We call them moths that can't fly. They have no muscles in their limbs. So they can't grip onto trees or branches. They can't even support themselves. One more thing. They don't have mouths. So they can't even eat. At most, they can only survive for 2 days. Two days. So why even bother spinning thread? Only their bodies are valuable. This is the final question for you. Will Miyuri Obara be able to answer it correctly? Why can't they fly? 3, 2, 1. Time's up. You got all the questions wrong. Even if their limbs break off, or they lose their heads... they still lead normal lives. Not even one of them... realizes they are crippled. Without sensing pain, a long life is pointless. Even if I squeeze it to death no one knows or cares. I'm fine. That's good. See you after school. Sorry I'm late. Let's hurry. It's my first time to go out with someone. Really? It's half an hour till the next train. Here it says 15 minutes. That train is going the other way. Oh, right. I hope it's wide open. And warm, too. It'll be beautiful. And the ocean will be especially beautiful. The fish, delicious. The ocean, so blue. Are you studying hard, Miyuri? Why haven't you replied to my messages? Here she is. Good work. Call the school. Your father called to tell us you were missing. We'll take you back. Let's go. Go back home. Walk properly. What's so funny? Keep walking. Ms Tomita, behave yourself. Ms Obara, continue on with the reading. "All he can think of is getting Gregor back his room as soon as possible." "If Gregor can stand up straight, he can go through the door.” "But he has no time to prepare for that."” Continue. "Almost as if he has no difficulties... his father bundles him from the room, making even more noise." "He hears his father's voice behind him. His only father..." Ms Tomita? Are you okay? Summer vacation starts tomorrow, but you must study. Be sure not to waste your time having fun. For those wanting to advance, this summer is crucial. Your profile says you're 21. Are you at university? Yes, I am. Don't I look like I am? I didn't say that. Which university? It's a public university. Are you at university, too? Yes, but I don't talk about it. It's a 3rd rate college. I've nothing to do all day. You're so pretty. You must have boyfriends. Why do you look for men on the internet? Because I'm bored. Me, too. Let's hi-five to that. So what now? Shall we get something to eat? Or go see a movie? I wonder what's playing? I'll look it up. So this is it, huh? What do you mean? Don't misunderstand. We met online. Think about it. We've never met before. No need to be so polite. Delete all contacts for Tsumugi Tomita Your grades aren't good enough. You need to study really hard for this last month. Your grades are good enough for a local public university. That's a sure pathway to a good career. That's what your mom wants, but what about you? I want to go to Tokyo. I see. Put away all pen cases and leave all pens on the desk. Do not open the exam until I say so. During the exam, all phones must be switched off. Like that. It's now 9:30. You may start. We can have crepes. I love crepes! Promise me you'll visit. For sure. We'll see you in Tokyo. How's the time? I'd better get going. Take care. Good luck. Make sure you eat well. Thanks, I will. I sure will. See you. Thank you. Take care. Congratulations. You did it. You're finally getting out of here. Is that all you have to say? She's gone. She's dead. What? All alone, in the corner of her room. She starved to death. Her father sexually abused her and she prostituted herself. She was so determined to go to Okinawa. What are your parents like? They're good people. Moeka Hoshi Serena Motola Written, Directed & Edited by Yuka Eda English Subtitles by Stuart J Walton (Sprout)
