You expect me to believe a man done this? One man? An unarmed man did all this? That's what we're told. By whom, exactly? What happened here? He was waiting for them. And he began to ask questions. How about? About you. What about me? I do not know, but they began to argue. What happened? All hell broke loose. Keep working, you. We need to get this railroad built. I know it's not much, though. That's perfect. You are perfect. And one day we will have land for our own and a house for all. I'm happy where we are, Jing. I know but. I do not need much. I just need you. I just need us. Forever. Forever. Take it up. Take it up. You pick either up or I'll shoot you dead. Take it up. Take it up. I'm sorry. You just drew on a law man. Get up boy. You've got to be out of your mind. Get away from my bars. I have not done anything wrong. Well it is a matter of perspective now, is not it? When the marshal comes back to town, he will decide what to do with you. When the marshal comes back to town, He sees that I am innocent. You are many things, but innocent is not one of them, boy. Jesus Christ, really, he smells like a fucking animal. You may want sick hose on him, Frank. Ask me where I was going. Where you heading to, Deputy? I'm glad you asked, you see I got a date with a friend, and I think our Mr. Chinese know exactly who she is, In fact, I know you know who she is.

I'm not going to lie to you, it's about your husband. I'm afraid he's in a lot of trouble. But I assure you, I am here to help you in any way I can. Where is he? There was an incident in the town. I saw it, it was not Jing wrong. Now, now, I'm not here to discuss the law or who did or did not do something. I'm just here to help you, you and your husband, to do this, fred-like. Hi Frank. Now, son, I had patience, I've been kind, but you made burnt my patience down to the fucking ground. You yellow-skinned shit, keep your hands off of ... You said he was, I must go and find my husband. I think you misunderstood my intentions. I'm sorry for the confusion. Your husband is clearly not here. I brought you here for personal reasons. Now I can help reunite you with him, and I would like to. But you will need to do one small thing for me. To get some, you have to give a little. Now you want to go and see your husband? Take my hand. Oh. This place brings back memories. See, when I was a kid, this place used to be a slaughterhouse. Still actually see blood stains on the animals. No. There will be over real soon, okay? And then you see your husband. You see him real soon, just be ... It is okay. It is okay. Shh. Shh. It is okay. Woo! Hey now. Åh of. Fuck. Åh of. Oh no no no.

I just need his name. You can kill me. What do you think I'll go do? He gave him what he wanted. What are you talking about? So you would be looking for him. Said to give this to Marshal Walker. Get some men together. And give me a tracker. What is it, Danny? Jake Sanders. He then? Jake was our tracker. Then find me another! Get! Make sure they get a fittin 'funeral. What a fucking mess. Jesus. He had not paid. Stick it on his tab, he's good for it. Go up! The gentlemen have me at a disadvantage, You seem to know who I am, I do not know who you are. Got a job for you. I'm retired. Not today you do not. So I guess I have no choice. No you do not. Vem grace '? Marshal Walker. What's the job? It is somewhat easy. You must track down a man. It's easy, huh? Why you need me? We need this done quickly. One thing I learned about trackin 'men. It is never easy and you damn sure never in a hurry. Well, there are two things. That one's a keeper. Where are my fucking britches? Crap. We will be looking Waitin. Come on, Danny. The second riders'll meet ya tomorrow. Marshal. Gallery. That should cover it. I take really good care of them. Just get them out on the street. Folks do not need to see this. He takes a wee, you hold it for him, he takes a shit, wiping up to him. But you keep him safe. Even Frank would really enjoy it, I am quite capable of taking care of myself. Which begs the question, why do not I join them? Give us a minute, Frank. Because to be your father, it's my job To protect yourself, James. Read this. Now you know why you can not go and why we need to finish this, be done with it. Let me clean up my own mess. Best you remember who made this mess in the first place. Makes me sick to think about what you've done. Do not take your eyes off me, boy. Best we get this dealt with quickly and let people forget if the Chinese and his wife. They will not ... Hello. You are my son and I love you, James, but this is the last time, the last fucking time. I made your mother a promise God rest his soul, I would keep you outta trouble. Trouble just seems to find you, right? And right now, I ask for forgiveness, and you oughta go with me. God turned his back on us long ago. You old fool. Mister, as far as the boy I've tried hard to forgive him. But it's just no good in him. It has never been. But fuck me, I made a promise to his mother on her deathbed I would make sure that no harm would come to him, even though I know it should. Forgive me for it. Forgive me for it. Whoa. You see something? And. City. You know, Senor, we're gettin 'real tired of your jokes. I buried only four of my men. We paid for results. Paid. First of all, no one spoke to me about money. Second of all, this guy killed four of your men. He did. Perhaps. But I see the badges attached to you and your friends. We are not planning to bring him in alive, tendons. Well, I'm a tracker, not a hunter. Do we have a problem, Senor? I do not. But maybe you do not put that steel back where it belongs. Now, about my fee. Eh. Senor. When we discover that the Chinese, and we do not need you anymore, We'll come back to this conversation, huh? Can not wait. And just for the record, I like women. Ya baby. And he says that fella's lucky in the short as well. Hey, she said. Hello Darling. Go up. Excuse me, gentlemen. Well, you are not angry enough to fight a bear with a hickory switch? There are four good men layin 'in pine boxes out on the street right there because of what you did. You have blood on your hands, boy. I said I'm sorry. You are sad. Sorry is not good enough. I come in here and catch you laughin 'and drinkin'. Might as well be pissin 'on their bodies. And what should I do? I'm not allowed to hunt the bastard, I'm not allowed to drink, what I may do, Father? You will go home and you'll stay there until this happens. Maybe if we're lucky, we cook it quickly you are still alive, but I promise you, I catch you in town again drinkin 'or whorin' Before you get caught, you get me to contend with. You better be ready to go all-in. You are not worth the bullet, old man. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Hyah. It is the horse he stole from us. He is walking now. Well I guess that says something about the man you are in when not? The man we hunt. And. Yes, that's what I said. And he is not a man. Horse is lame. Figure that is why he does not want to ride it in the dirt. Hyah. Hyah. That horse does not look lame. Oh, you know a lot about horses, then do ya? I know that the horse belongs to us. Well why do not you go chase it, then? You know, gringo, you become a real pain in the ass. You may want to have controlled by Dr. Wade when you get back there. Could be anything serious. There will be serious when we discover that the Chinese, right? To you. I thought that's why you have not discussed my fee yet. Not too dark. Let's make camp. Camp? We just found his groove! Hey, we're going to follow him now. Maybe you missed the part about it is dark. I can not save what I can not see. Camp. Get away. Also in '. Do I look as if we are running late. What do you expect? Chinese do all the work. I expect when I pay good money for a job it oughta be done when I need it done. Speakin 'salary. You owe me on my drawing. I got mouths to feed, too. You are lucky needs these tracks. Pleasure doing business with you. Did you hear that? Where? Spread out, spread out, dammit. Are you hungry? Well. What is your plan, son? Who said I had one? Well, you'll just keep killin men until you get what you are looking for? Mm-hmm. I hoped that I was looking for was with you. You know Walker's son, too lazy pig pen. Do you really think that he can come out here lookin 'for you? Now his father, his father's men. It's a Whole Lotta weapon to go up against a single man. Man you after it's quite the man hiding behind other men. They're not stoppin 'until you are dead. I'm already dead. What will you do with it? I have not really decided yet. But I need to resign. Do it. Send me to my family. Why not walk away from this, son. There is nothing in it. The bastard never the right place when I need it. Why do not you help me? What do you want me to do, son? Just send a message to him. I can do it. Whoa. Ho. What the hell happened here? Damn you think happened? When the marshal? Should be in his house on the hill. Shoot. You stay here. Give me the gun, Ben. You never listen to me, James? Chinese. Well he did to us like a hot knife in butter, did not he? Did you lose one? Could not find a body when the sun comes up. I Wolves were clearly '. Well you're tracker, it was wolves or not? Long after Seein what I saw, was not going to stick around to find out. How is it that you're still alive? Well, he wanted me to deliver a message. Which is? I think you're lookin 'at it. If you'd just listened to me and let me take Danny and Frank to hunt this man down We would not be having this conversation with a half-wit tracker. Well, you are certainly right about that, boy. You would not be having this conversation, because you'd be dead. Did you talk to him? Well, more accurately, he spoke to me, and he told me to stop him. Then I think that your services no longer needed. Add it away. Not. You will join us for supper. We need to talk about the details of what you saw. The more I know about this man, the better. Well, I appreciate that, sir. But you know, I've done my job. In getting the best. No. I insist. Kinda figured you would. To your health. You seem a little nervous, tracker. Well. A bit tired I guess. What can you tell us about this man? Where you want me to start? Start with something that will help us find him and kill him. Well I can tell from what I've seen, that will not be easy. But I guess you already know that. That's why I'm here. Do you think he will ever stop? When he is dead. Sit down. Sit down. We will listen to him. Will you stop, boy? Do you want to quit? Would you if they tried to rape your wife pregnant? Would you? How about they beat her to death with their bare hands, boy? Huh? How about they took away your future, you would, would you? Someone tried to rape your wife pregnant? Would ya? Excuse us. Little pussy. Go in there. I did not know! What do you mean you do not know? Difference it would make if you had known? I told you before. It's best to be ready to go all-in. You is not got the guts. There's blood on my hands, too. Forgive me. You still keep your god! You think he can save me? You are more than saving. But it is my Failin ', not his. I'm finished with you. Boy has always been concerned. Need some God in their lives. He resists. After today, and given that I do not trust you, I think it would be best you left town. Well I best get a head start on leavin 'time. I'll go with ya, so you do not change your mind. Whoa. It does not look like you brought enough men. Do not worry about it. I can get more. Shh. I got ya now China boy. Shoulda picked up the gun the day on the street. It's a shame that you did so much and accomplished so little. Come on, let's get out of here. Run run run run! Is not safe here, son. They will be back. More guns. And they will keep comin 'back. I'm counting on it. You can go. Oh, I can, I can? It seems like I've done too much of that already. And while I appreciate that I had no other place to be. I do not even know your name. My dad gave me Christopher King. But my friends call me Chris. You know that it is customary that you provide your name back. Jing Phang. Well it's a pleasure to meet ya, Jing Phang. Son of a bitch, son. Let's get you fixed up. Come on now. I think I will like this place. Your woman as beautiful as this shit hole? Let me make something clear to you boys. This is my town. As long as you're in my town, you will treat my people with respect, or you will end up in jail or Swingin 'at the end of a rope. Yes sir, Marshal sir. M gonna I regret hirin 'you? We will get the job done. Okay. You see something? Why only one? And. It is all you need if there is only one man you want to kill. Who you tryin to kill? You ask a lot of questions, do not ya? I apologize about that, son. How about you, you got family back in China? Brothers, sisters? No. Of? Little brother named Porter. Mom and Dad died young, so he is more like a son, but that the boy's special. Where is he now? In a hole, next to her mother and her father. This Colt here last bit of him I got. And I tell you something, this son of bitch woulda shot when it's supposed to, Perhaps it would be him Sittin 'on the stage with this call. The ball is meant for you, is not it? Well I tried to convince this for a while, but seems like the bullet had other plans. It does not matter, though. You can not hide it forever. It comes home when it is completed. They are all dead. He came at us like a wild bobcat. Took out three of our men. I did not sign up for this. You say you want to take down one guy. You're gettin 'paid to do a job. You do not pay us enough for this. We had an agreement. If you do not want to be a fool, Marshal, I would be to put the gun away and deal with your own problems. Well hold on, gentlemen, I will double your ticket. Boy. I'm Feelin generous, gentlemen, I'll triple it. Now you're talking my kind of language. Let's go, boys. Where you think you're goin '? James? I'll end whatyou could not stop. No you are not. You come back to town with me, and you come to the church, where you will be safe, and where you can ask forgiveness for what you have done. Forgiveness? From whom God? I shoulda stopped yourself, years ago. Take your hands off me, man. What would your mother think of what you've become? You may not talk about her. I know what you did when I was a child, I saw you beat her. You never thought I saw it, huh? Every evening after you drank her blood stained hands. Now you can talk about the man I have become. Well, the apple does not fall far from the tree, right? I used to look up to you. Damn, I had to, all my life. I wanted to be you, I wanted Take control as you do. But you found God and became shell of a man I once worshiped. You were weak. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away. Revelation 21: 4th Go be with God. You've always loved him more than me. Let's go. No one is here. Where the hell are they? Let's go, boy. That's perfect. You are perfect. Forever. Forever. Wake! Hmm. That's it, keep him awake. I want him to see everything coming. Nice of you to join us. When I say I'm sorry for what happened to your wife, know I mean it from the bottom of my heart. It's a shame to think of all the fun we could have had every night she had of been less weak. My father would have approved of this, it is a pity he is not around to see it. He would have wanted me though our little quarrels all by myself. But I want you to watch your friend die before returning to the dust. So let's get right to it. There's an old friend. I bet you miss. Always a joker. I admire it, tracker. Do it. Shoot him! Jesus Christ. You put the steel back where it belongs. Do it. Hyah. Go up! Go up. Go up! Forever.
