I'M CLOSE TO CRACKING THIS KIDNAPPING CASE. PLEASE, DO NOT PULL ME OFF NOW. I HAVE TWO MORE MONTHS BEFORE I STEP DOWN, AND I HAVE MADE MY POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS QUITE WELL KNOWN. SOMEONE WANTS TO STOP ME. THAT IS POLITICAL PARANOIA. THE SHOOTING HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU, AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY CASE. Intercom: CHIEF INSPECTOR, THE MAYOR IS ON THE LINE.

I'M TAKING YOU BACK TO YOUR APARTMENT, AND I'M INSISTING YOU STAY THERE, AND ALLOW US TO DO OUR JOB. I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR JOB.

LISTEN, I WANT TO SOLVE THIS CASE AND BE DONE WITH IT MORE THAN ANYONE, BUT THE FACT IS ALL I'VE GOT IS THIS ANDRE MARKIWICH. MARKINICH. AND NOW OSLER KNOWS HIS NAME. ERIK, YOUR FRIEND OSLER STINKS. THE BULLET REMOVED FROM MY FATHER, THE BULLET YOUR FRIEND OSLER SAYS WAS NEVER FOUND, CAME FROM THE GUN I RECOVERED. YOUR BALLISTICS GUY TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT. I DIDN'T THINK YOU KNEW. ERIK, IT ALL ADDS UP. HE TOOK YOU OFF YOUR CASE BECAUSE YOU WERE GETTING TOO CLOSE. HE SEALED THE BALLISTICS REPORT BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE ITS CONTENTS. HE MADE SURE HE GOT MARKINICH'S NAME. OH, SO YOU THINK HANS WOULD DO SOMETHING TO MARKINICH. YES. WHAT ABOUT HIM? HE'S YOUR SUSPECT. NOT ANYMORE. THE NIGHT OF THE SHOOTING, MY FATHER WAS LATE. HE INTRODUCED ME TO AN OLD FRIEND-- HANS OSLER. HE ATE BY THE WINDOW WITH ANOTHER MAN. HE WAS STILL THERE WHEN WE LEFT. WE WALKED OUT OF THE RESTAURANT... [ gunshot] I HEARD DAD GASP. I TURNED AROUND AND SAW THE MAN STOP ABOUT THERE. BUT I DID NOT SEE A GUN IN HIS HAND. MAYBE HE HAD IT HIDDEN. HE LOOKED TO HIS LEFT. THEN WHIRLED AROUND AND TOOK OFF. I TURNED BACK TO DAD, WHO WAS LYING ON THE SIDEWALK. HE'D FALLEN WITH HIS BACK TO THE DOOR, WHICH MEANS THAT THE BULLET DID NOT COME FROM HIM. IT CAME FROM... [ gunshot ] THERE. SO THE SNIPER WAS IN THE BMW. Tracy: AND THE TARGET WAS NOT ME, NEITHER MY FATHER, NOR HANS OSLER. IT WAS KONSTANTIN VARDA. VARDA? ANDRE MARKINICH? GOOD NEWS. I HAD AN INSTINCT, A FEELING YOUR KIDNAPPING CASE AND MY FATHER'S SHOOTING WERE CONNECTED. JUST SHUT THE DOOR. YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT OSLER, EXPOSE THE TRUTH. COME ON, I'VE KNOWN OSLER FOR YEARS. HE DOESN'T HAVE A SINGLE MARK AGAINST HIM. THERE'S BEEN NO REASON TO SUSPECT HIM. KONSTANTIN. KONSTANTIN VARDA, OUR CHIEF SUSPECT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE? MISS TRACY, I HEAR DOOR JUST IN TIME. I SNEAK OUT BALCONY. WAIT HERE. YOUR FRIEND FROM CALIFORNIA? COME ON, LET'S GO. Erik: THE RUSSIAN MAFIA KIDNAPPED HIS CHILD. WHY RUSSIAN? ORGANIZED CRIME IS THE NEW COMMUNISM. THE RUSSIANS ARE DEEP INTO THE REFUGEE CAMPS. BLACK MARKET, DRUGS, GUN RUNNING, EVEN NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY. AND THEY'RE VERY WELL CONNECTED. INFANTS STARTED DISAPPEARING MORE FREQUENTLY TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO. WHEN WAS YOUR DAUGHTER KIDNAPPED? - FOUR MONTHS AGO. - AND SUDDENLY HE'S SHIPPED OFF TO MUNICH-- NO POLICE EFFORT TO FIND HIS CHILD, NOTHING. WHY DID YOU COME BACK TO BERLIN? I HEAR RUMOR. MAYBE MY DAUGHTER HERE SOMEWHERE. A RUMOR? A MAN HAS MY NADIA. BRUMM. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS BEFORE? I NOT SURE I TRUST YOU. - [ Erik dialing] - NOW I DO. PETRA, GET ME A LIST OF COUPLES DENIED ADOPTION THE PAST FOUR YEARS, AND RUN A CHECK ON THE NAME OF BRUMM. OKAY. BRUMM MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU? MANFRED BRUMM DOES. HE'S GOT MORE MONEY THAN GOD, AND HE IS VERY WELL-CONNECTED. OKAY, YOU'LL STAY HERE. YOU'LL BE SAFE. TOMORROW NIGHT IS A BENEFIT DINNER AT THE LAPIDARIUM MUSEUM. MANFRED BRUMM WILL BE THERE, AND SO WILL WE. SEEMS SOMEONE FELL IN, HUH? OH. THAT'S WHY WE GIVE YOU SWIMMING LESSONS, HUH? SO, MR. BRUMM, YOUR LOVELY WIFE AND BEAUTIFUL BABY DAUGHTER ARE WELL? QUITE WELL, THANK YOU. AND YOUR FAMILY? SEEMS LIKE I'M ALWAYS HAVING TO IMPOSE NEW DISCIPLINES, BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A FAMILY AS LARGE AS MINE, I GUESS IT'S TO BE EXPECTED. OUR ENTERPRISES, PROGRESSING WELL? WE ARE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, AND GAINING EVERY DAY. AND THE MINOR INCONVENIENCE? HMM? THAT ROMANIAN. THIS PROBLEM WILL GO AWAY SOON. GOOD. MY FAMILY WILL BE GRATEFUL. CONSIDER IT DONE. AND THEY SAY THE GERMANS AND RUSSIANS COULDN'T WORK TOGETHER. HMM. [ both chuckle ] YOU MIND? NO. YOU SUITS DON'T GET DOWN HERE VERY OFTEN. HELP YOURSELF. YOU DIDN'T COME DOWN TO THE DUNGEON JUST TO, LIKE, LET OFF STEAM, DID YOU? TELL ME, THAT AMERICAN WHO WAS SHOT, DID YOU CONDUCT THOSE TESTS? NO, THAT WAS WALTER. - WALTER. - YEAH. IS HE AROUND? NO, LUCKY MAN'S LYING ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE IN MAJORCA. UH-HUH. VACATION. HOW ABOUT HIS REPORT? SEALED AND REMOVED. THERE ISN'T EVEN A LAB COPY. THAT'S NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE, IS IT? NO, IT CERTAINLY ISN'T. POOR WALTER WAS HALFWAY OUT THE DOOR, AND OSLER DEMANDED THAT HE TAKE THE CASE OVER. I MEAN, I REALIZE IT'S HIGH PRIORITY, BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN OSLER QUITE SO EAGER. I SEE. WELL, THANK YOU. A PLEASURE. NICE TO SEE YOU, ERIK. TAKE CARE. SEE YOU. BUT THERE'S A BEAR WALKING THROUGH THE WOODS. AND HE'S SO HUNGRY. HE NEEDS FOOD. HE WANTS TO EAT A LITTLE FROM YOUR HAND. "EMIL AND THE DETECTIVES." Konstantin: BUT STILL HUNGRY! YOUR FATHER WILL REMAIN ON A 24-HOUR WATCH. THANK YOU. OH, GREAT, YOU FOUND EMIL. IT'S BEEN MISSING FOR YEARS. I USED TO LOVE THIS BOOK AS A CHILD. YOUR NO FRIEND, MIKE. YOUR NOT MY FRIEND. I'LL LOOK FOR OTHER BEAR. I ASKED TANTE EDDA TO PUT VARDA UP FOR THE NIGHT. [ meows like cat ] THAT POOR MAN. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES WE'LL RECOVER HIS CHILD? HARD TO SAY. BUT STILL HUNGRY. BEAR STILL HUNGRY. Erik: "WHEN HE HEARD THE VOICE, EMIL EXCLAIMED, 'WHY, IT'S MRS. WIRTH.' SHE WAS THE WIFE OF THE BAKER, AND HE KNEW HER QUITE WELL. 'GOOD MORNING, MRS. WIRTH,' HE SAID, AND PUT HIS JUG DOWN BELOW THE WASHBASIN. 'I HEAR YOU'RE GOING TO BERLIN, YOU LUCKY BOY.' 'HE DID NOT REALLY WANT TO GO AT FIRST,' SAID HIS MOTHER, STILL RUBBING. 'BUT WHAT IS THERE FOR HIM TO DO HERE ALL THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS? BESIDES, HE'S NEVER BEEN TO BERLIN, THOUGH MY SISTER MARTA HAS--'" MY SISTER MARTA. "'HAS ASKED US OFTEN ENOUGH." WHY HAVE YOU NOT EXTERMINATED THIS VARDA YET? WHY? WE HAVE A PLAN TO GET HIM. HE'S HIDING WITH THE COP. THIS COP WHO IS PROTECTING HIM-- THE ONE WORKING WITH THE AMERICAN? YES. YOU HAVE NEW ORDERS. AFTER THE ROMANIAN, THAT COP, AND THEN THE AMERICAN WOMAN WILL BE NEXT. SHE'S A NUISANCE. GET RID OF HER. BUT HER FATHER'S CIA. WON'T THAT BLOW UP IN OUR FACES? THE AMERICAN DISAPPEARS AND THEN THE ROMANIAN, OR YOU DO. CHOOSE. [ phone ringing] HELLO? RIGHT. GOT IT. GOOD WORK, PETRA. WHEN? [ sirens blaring ] Man: LET'S BRING SOME BODY BAGS OVER HERE. [ people chattering ] [ baby crying ] [ people chattering ] Man: WANNA TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPHS OVER THERE TOO? THIS IS A JOB FOR A PRIEST, NOT THE POLICE. [ cell phone rings ] EXCUSE ME. MARTA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M FINE, PAPA. UNCLE HANS WAS HERE. UNCLE HANS? HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A MAN STAYING HERE THAT HE WANTED TO TALK TO. BUT THERE WAS NO ONE HERE BUT ME AND TANTE EDDA, RIGHT, PAPA? YES, OF COURSE. UNCLE HANS BROUGHT A LOT OF POLICEMEN WITH HIM. TANTE EDDA GOT SCARED, BUT NOT ME. I'M BRAVE. YOU'RE VERY BRAVE. UNCLE HANS LEFT A POLICEMAN HERE TO STAY WITH US. HE LET ME WEAR HIS HAT. I BET IT LOOKS TERRIFIC. LISTEN, I'VE GOT SOME MORE WORK HERE TO DO. YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB THERE. JUST MIND TANTE EDDA, OKAY? PAPA LOVES YOU. BYE. [ squeaking ] [ baby crying ] SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH. ERIK? GOOD MORNING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF SPECULATION REGARDING MY PLANS FOR THE FUTURE AFTER MY RETIREMENT FROM THE FORCE. SO TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO END THE SPECULATION. I'M VERY HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT I'LL BE SEEKING POLITICAL OFFICE. I'LL BE RUNNING FOR MAYOR OF BERLIN. I THINK THAT MY EXPERIENCE AS CHIEF OF POLICE, AND ONE OF BERLIN'S MOST EFFECTIVE... CRIME FIGHTERS HAS GIVEN ME THE CREDENTIALS TO BE A STRONG POLITICAL LEADER IN THIS CITY. ESPECIALLY IN DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TIMES LIKE THIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ reporters chattering ] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WANT ANSWERS. YOU WANT ANSWERS? HOW CAN I GIVE YOU ANSWERS WHEN I DON'T KNOW THE QUESTIONS? YOU STORM INTO MY APARTMENT WHEN I'M NOT EVEN THERE. WE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE YOU WERE HIDING THE SUSPECT. [ chuckles ] AND WHAT MADE YOU THINK THAT? WELL, YOU WERE SEEN IN THE COMPANY OF MS. GARRET. THE CONNECTION TO YOU IS QUITE LOGICAL. ERIK, HAVE A SEAT. LOOK AT YOURSELF. TELL ME SHE HASN'T HAD AN INFLUENCE ON YOU. AND WHO'S HAD AN INFLUENCE OVER YOU SO MUCH THAT YOU WOULD MISLEAD A MURDER INVESTIGATION? THAT'S PRETTY OUTRAGEOUS. THAT BALLISTICS REPORT. WHY WAS IT SEALED? WHY HASN'T ANYONE SEEN IT? WHY WAS WALTER SENT AWAY? YOU'RE SAYING... THE WITNESS MS. GARRET TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS FOUND FLOATING IN THE SPREE. HAVE YOU LOST YOUR SENSES? I WANT TO BE WRONG, BUT I KEEP COMING TO THE SAME CONCLUSION. I'M ASKING YOU: STOP THIS COVER-UP. THIS IRRATIONAL BEHAVIOR OF YOURS IS UNEXPLAINABLE. YOU LEAVE ME NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO RECOMMEND YOUR SUSPENSION. BEFORE YOU LEAVE, I MUST ASK YOU TO SURRENDER YOUR FIREARM. OH, WE'VE NOTHING MORE TO DISCUSS. YOU CAUGHT ME. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU DOING HERE? WAITING. FOR? TWO THINGS. WHAT TWO THINGS? SANCTUARY. MAYBE ABSOLUTION. SANCTUARY, YOU HAD IN THE HOSPITAL. PILLS I HAD IN THE HOSPITAL, DAUGHTER. PILLS AND AMATEUR GUARDS. HOW DID YOU GET OUT? OLD TRICKS OF THE TRADE. AFTER ALL, I'M A COMPANY MAN. YOU KNEW THAT, OR AT LEAST YOU DO NOW. YES. I'VE BEEN TOLD. YOU PUT ME IN AN EMBARRASSING POSITION, DAD. I'M SORRY. I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU. NO. YOU WERE TRYING TO KEEP ME IN THE DARK. NO, I WANTED TO PROTECT YOU. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU. I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE RIGHT, THOSE THINGS YOU SAID IN THE RESTAURANT. AND YOU KNOW I HATE IT WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU KNOW, THAT BULLET WAS KIND OF A MAGIC BULLET. IT HELPED ME SEE THINGS A LITTLE CLEARER. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT A BRUSH WITH MORTALITY THAT HELPS YOUR VISION. HAVE YOU NOTICED THINGS AROUND THE APARTMENT? SEE ALL THE PICTURES? PICTURES OF YOUR MOTHER, AND YOU AND ME. YEAH, EVEN PICTURES OF THAT GAME WE USED TO PLAY. REMEMBER? DETECTIVE THAT YOU LOVED SO MUCH. YOU ALWAYS MADE ME THE PRISONER, REMEMBER? I WAS YOUR PRISONER. I'VE BEEN YOUR PRISONER MOST OF YOUR LIFE. IT HAPPENS TO FATHERS WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECT IT, WHEN THEIR LITTLE GIRLS ARE VERY VERY YOUNG. AND SUDDENLY, ONE DAY, THEY LOOK AT 'EM IN A CERTAIN WAY, AND AT THAT MOMENT, THE FATHER REALIZES HE'S A PRISONER, AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. I'VE BEEN YOUR PRISONER EVER SINCE. THAT'S WHY I KEEP THESE PICTURES HERE. KEEPS THE MEMORIES WARM AND KEEPS ME CLOSE TO YOU. YOU COULD'VE HAD ME IN FLESH AND BLOOD. INSTEAD, YOU PUT ME IN BOARDING SCHOOLS WITH STRANGERS. YOU DIDN'T WANT ME. YOU CHOSE YOUR WORK OVER ME. NO. NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. AFTER YOUR MOTHER DIED, MY LIFE WAS A SHAMBLES. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TREAT A LITTLE GIRL I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO BE A MOTHER. GOD KNOWS, I WOULD'VE BEEN IF I COULD'VE. I'D HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH MORE OF MY FATHER. I'M SURE THAT'S RIGHT. I'M SURE. [ groans ] I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU'RE TAKING ON MY CASE. IT'S AN INTERESTING CASE, FULL OF SURPRISES. A WISE MAN ONCE TOLD ME THE APPLE NEVER FALLS FAR FROM THE TREE. IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE. MANFRED BRUMM. THIS IS A THRILL. DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER? WELL, I'M SURE YOU KNOW MY FATHER. PAUL DELLA MARCO OF DELLA MARCO CEMENT. DELLA MARCO, OF COURSE. FROM CHICAGO. I'M TRACY, AND THIS IS WOLFGANG MY BODYGUARD. NOW YOU MUST PROMISE ME A DANCE. IT WILL BE MY PLEASURE. WHO'S THAT GIRL? I DON'T KNOW. DON'T GET LOST IN THE ROLE, OKAY? TIME TO MAKE GOOD ON THAT PROMISE. EXCUSE ME. WHAT A DANCER. IT'S A GOOD THING YOUR WIFE'S HERE, OTHERWISE I'D HAVE TO MONOPOLIZE YOU. NOW WHAT WAS IT MY FATHER WAS SAYING? YOU HAVE TWO CHILDREN? I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK THAT I AM RUDE, BUT I NEVER DISCUSS MY FAMILY IN PUBLIC. OH, SURE, I UNDERSTAND. OH, NOW I REMEMBER. HE SAID YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BABY DAUGHTER. WHAT WAS HER NAME? OH, SOMEONE IS LEAVING I MUST TALK TO. PLEASE, EXCUSE ME. HI, MRS. BRUMM. YES, ONE CHILD. OH, REALLY? HOW OLD IS SHE? I'LL GET BACK TO YOU LATER. EIGHT MONTHS OLD. ONLY CHILD. PRIVATELY ADOPTED, AND HER NAME IS ANDREA. GOOD WORK, WOLFGANG. WHAT? [ dialogue inaudible ] [ dialogue inaudible ] I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS. I WOULD'VE KNOWN IF HE ASSOCIATED WITH BRUMM. MAYBE YOU WERE TOO CLOSE TO HIM TO SEE. WE HAVE TO GET INTO BRUMM'S HOUSE, SEE THAT GIRL, THEN WE'LL KNOW. [ pager beeps ] SHIT. HAND ME THE PHONE, PLEASE. [ telephone rings ] COME ON. WE'VE GOTTA GO BACK TO MY PLACE. [ tires squeal ] DON'T MOVE! Edda: ERIK! ERIK! HERE, GET HIM, DETECTIVE. [ man yells] [ gunshot] Woman: OH, MY GOD! THEY'RE SHOOTING! [ gunshot] DAMN! [ alarm blaring ] OKAY, LET'S BE COOL. DROP THE GUN. NO! NO! LET THE LADY GO. I AM DEAD. - I'LL KILL HER ANYWAY. - DROP IT. I SAID DROP THE GUN! [ gunshot] DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS CHILD? SORRY, I DON'T. I CAN'T HELP YOU. SHE'S THIS MAN'S DAUGHTER, KIDNAPPED FROM A REFUGEE CAMP HERE IN BERLIN. I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. Wife: MANFRED? MANFRED, WHAT IS IT? NADIA. NADIA. NADIA. IT'S NADIA. WHEN I FOUND OUT HOW LONG WE'D HAVE TO WAIT FOR A LEGAL ADOPTION, I BECAME IMPATIENT. OH MY GOD, MANFRED. [ baby coos ] HOW DID YOU EVER GET HANS OSLER TO DO YOUR DIRTY WORK? YOU BLACKMAILED HIM, RIGHT? WHAT WAS IT, SOMETHING FROM HIS PAST? SOMETHING SO HOT, IT COULD HAVE ENDED HIS CAREER? NO COMMENT. YOU THINK WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR TIES TO THE RUSSIAN MOB, HUH? ABOUT THE KICKBACKS, YOUR SLIMY BRIBES? THE MONEY LAUNDERING? BUT BLACKMAIL AND STOLEN BABIES, THOSE CRIMES HAVE REAL VICTIMS. WHAT DID YOU HAVE ON OSLER? TELL ME! HE FORGED PASSPORTS. SO HIS RELATIVES FROM THE EAST COULD DEFECT. THIS WAS YEARS AGO. AND HE NEVER COULD HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT US. AND THE LITTLE GIRL? MAMA. [ baby crying ] [ announcer chattering] I DON'T CARE WHAT THOMAS WOLFE SAID, I'M GOING HOME AGAIN. IT ONLY TOOK 15 YEARS, A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE, AND A DETERMINED DAUGHTER, BUT I AM GOING HOME AGAIN. OKAY. THERE THEY ARE. I'M SO GLAD YOU GUYS MADE IT. OF COURSE WE DID. MARTA INSISTED. THIS IS FOR YOU. I WRAPPED IT MYSELF. THANK YOU, MARTA. HELLO. OH, ERIK, THIS IS MY DAD, COLONEL-- FORGET THE COLONEL. CALL ME CLIFF. NICE TO MEET YOU. AND I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOUR NAME IS MARTA. MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME ALL ABOUT YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO? I'D LIKE TO TAKE YOU DOWN TO A SWEET SHOP DOWN THERE, AND GET YOU SOMETHING VERY SWEET FOR A VERY SWEET GIRL. IS THAT ALL RIGHT, DAD? SURE, GO AHEAD. GOOD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WE MAKE A GOOD TEAM, YOU AND I. COME BACK. AS WE SAY IN BERLIN, AUF WIEDERSEHEN. UNTIL NEXT TIME.
