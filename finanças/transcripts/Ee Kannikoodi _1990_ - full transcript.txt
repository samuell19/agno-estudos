Kumudam! Kumudam! Yes? I came to report something. Tell me. A woman I've known is lying dead in her house. Was she killed or did she die on her own? I don't know. It looks like a murder. Where does she live? The street is called 'Tatta Kudil'. The house is on the left side of the main road. In the middle of the compound. Hey, write an FIR. What was the dead lady's name? - Kumudam. How do you know her? - She's just a friend. What's your name? Thomas. Where do you live? - Ernakulam. Do you work here? - No, I work in Ernakulam. What do you do? - I'm a manager in a hotel. When did you come here? - This morning. Sir, this man came to report an accident. Where? - On 'Tatta Kudil' lane. Did you prepare an FIR? - We are doing it, sir. When did you go to her house? About 20 minutes ago. Okay. Don't allow anyone inside. - Yes, sir. Wait. This is the room she is in, sir. Please stand aside. Sir, do not step here. Please go that way. Move it. Bring him to the station. We'll have to investigate the surrounding area. - Yes, sir. Come with me. Thomas. - Yes. You are here right now as a prime suspect in this case. If you want to be free, speak only the truth. Do you understand? Who was this woman? She.. Was she a prostitute? Yes, I believe so. That means you have been visiting her often. I've just visited her twice, before this. How did you come to know about this woman? She visited the hotel where I worked a long time ago - What is your hotel's name? Hotel Delight. When did she visit your hotel? The third week of February. Was she staying alone in the hotel? No, she was with a businessman. Do you know his name? N.S. Swami. He's an exporter. She often visited my hotel with this man. In February, one night, there was an incident. Four friends of that businessman joined him in his room. After seeing that woman, they decided not to leave. That woman was very stubborn. She told him that she won't entertain his friends. But the businessman didn't like that. And those men were drunk, they started forcing her. I was staying on the same floor that night. - Okay. When I went to enquire, I saw these men attacking her. She was trying to run away from them. I got involved. But they were adamant and tough. When they came to know that I'm the manager, they left. I took that woman to my room. She was crying the entire night. In the morning, she left. So, that's how you know her. She was grateful to me for what I did that night. She gave me her address and invited me home. I get three holidays at the end of every month. At the end of February, I visited her home. She was very happy. She asked me to visit her often. I visited her last month, too. Did you have a physical relationship with her? No, sir. To be honest, at first I did have the desire. But after getting to knowing her I didn't feel like taking advantage of her. I trust you. You can, sir. Where did she belong? I don't know. She never told me. Didn't you ever ask her? I did, but she refused to tell me. So, what kind of conversation did you have with her? She was a well-educated woman. She liked talking about art and the world. She told me that she enjoyed my company. How many times have you visited her house? I visited her in March and then again, this morning. Did you notice anything about her behaviour or conversation which could be the reason for her death? Nothing. - Have you seen anyone visit her when you were at her home? The last time I was with her, a 30-year-old man visited her home. They talked secretly for a while. Did he see you? Yes, he was a friendly guy. He talked to me before he left. What was his name? Mani, if I am not mistaken. I guessed his profession by his behaviour. Pimp? - Yes. Do you know about this guy? Yes, sir. He's already on our list. Do you want me to bring him here? - Yes. Okay, sir. Until we find that killer you will face many inconveniences. You cannot leave as yet. You have to wait. Mani lives here, right? - Yes, sir. Which room? - Room number 16. I can call him here. No, I'll go and meet him. Ramu, take the officer to room 16. Please come. This is his room. He's not here. He must be in the shower. - Where is it? Do you want me to call him? No, you may go. Don't stick around. Are you trying to flash me? Put your clothes back on! Sir, why are you here? I can send you my dues. It's not even the 30th yet. If you wish, I can pay now. Here. How much do you have? I have around Rs. 350, sir. Keep that money back in your wallet. Sir, I can give more. - Just keep it in your wallet. Do you know Kumudam who lives in 'Tatta Kudil'? Yes, but how do you know her? Sir, she's a high-level escort. If you wish, I can arrange her.. - Did you go there yesterday? Yes, I did. Did you kill her? Why would I kill her, sir? I don't know anything. Really? Come with me! But let me get dressed first. Get dressed! What happened to Kumudam? Stop acting smart with me. Yes, I wrote this letter. 'Sultan is here'. Who is Sultan? He is a client from Kozhikode, sir. People call him Sultan. 'At 1900, Breeze 115, Bell.' What does this mean? It means, Hotel Breeze. 115 is the client's hotel room number. 1900 means, 7 p.m. The time she was supposed to reach the hotel. 'Bell' means Mani. That's me. That's my name. Your business is like a military operation. So, you used to contact her using code language. Not always. When she's not home, I drop letters like this. How long have you known her? I've known her for seven months. Where did you first meet her? I met her at Malanar Motel. How? Tell me! There was a manager named Anthony at Malanar Motel. When he opened this motel business wasn't going too well. So, he turned to the prostitution business. He hired a few prostitutes. Kumudam was one of them. That's how I got involved in this business with her. Is it Anirudh who owns Malanar motel? - Yes, sir. Did he have a relationship with Kumudam? What do you mean by relationship? Yes, I know what you are thinking. I mean a physical relationship. He's not that kind of person, sir. He's just a businessman. He doesn't smoke drink or engage with women for that manner. But he makes others do such things and runs his business, right? Does her house belong to Anirudh? No, it's on rent. I found that house for Kumudam. And when was that? Probably, around three months ago. These prostitutes were first accommodated in the motel. But the sub-inspector who worked here earlier was very strict. He used to conduct raids at our hotel. So, Mr. Anirudh asked me to find houses for these prostitutes and we shifted them out of the motel. Where did the other prostitutes go? Like I said, because of the former sub-inspector we couldn't run the business well. As a result, those women started leaving the area, except Kumudam. Because of her beauty and decency she had a steady flow of clients. How can she be decent if she was involved in this business? She was a decent lady by nature. She was probably from a good family. Do you know where she is from? No, but I did ask her about that. She did not tell me. She told me that it is none of my business. Sir, there are a few limitations between a prostitute and people like us. So, we don't get very personal with them. That is just how it is. You said you visited her often, right? Not daily, but I would go at least four days a week. You used to be her pimp, didn't you? So, tell me. Do you suspect anyone? No one that I know of. Of late, did you notice any changes or differences in her behaviour? Now that I think about it I believe something went wrong in her life. Why do you think so? Ten days ago, a man visited Malanar Motel. Who? - A businessman from Ernakulam. He used to contact Kumudam often. But I don't suspect that man. One night, I was taking Kumudam to a hotel. When we reached the hotel we met Mr. Anirudh at the counter. Hello, yes. The conference is in Ernakulam, right? Okay, I'll come to the airport. I'll come there and meet you. I'll be at the airport. Yes, sure. Sure, we can do that. All right. Just a minute. Hey, Mani! Come here. I have to talk to her. Tell her to wait near my room. - Okay, sir. Hello. Mr. Anirudh wants to talk to you. He wants you to wait outside his room. - Okay. Come in. Don't you understand? I told you to end that relationship. What's wrong? His brother called me. He wants to know where you live. Look, I don't want any trouble. Go and stay somewhere else. Or else, just go away from here. Don't try to threaten me. I don't depend on anyone to live. I didn't force him to come to me. That's his choice. I don't decline my clients. You are ruining someone's family. That's his concern, not mine. Which room? - Room number three. Who was Anirudh talking about? I have no idea, sir. This happened ten days ago, right? Yes, sir. When was the last time you saw her? The evening before she died. There was a customer at Malanar Motel. I told her about this client. So, I went to pick Kumudam up in a taxi. Hey, aren't you ready yet? I told you to be ready by 7.30 p.m. I'm not coming tonight. You may go, Mani. Why not? Are you not well? Yes, I'm not feeling well. It's okay. He's your old client. Just spend some time with him and come back soon. We can't disappoint this client. He asked me to arrange you, a week ago. I gave him my word. I cannot disappoint him. Come on, get dressed. I'll wait. No, Mani. I can't come tonight. How can you say that? My promises have value. At least meet him, please. I won't come. Don't wait here. What's wrong? Is someone here with you? I'll give you some privacy or I can come back after half an hour. No, just leave. This is not good. I'll have to find another girl now. Your other client from Kozhikode will be here tomorrow. I will call you as soon as he is here. I'm very positive that someone was with her that night. Did Kumudam allow customers into her home too? Not usually, sir. She was very firm about things like that. But I can't guarantee that, though. I saw this man at Kumudam's house once. When was that? A month ago, on the 20th or 30th, or so. Did you see anyone else? - Well.. I used to see a jeep in front of her house on weekends. If I thought she was with someone, I would not disturb them. Or I would wait till they leave. Apart from this, do you remember anything unusual or recollect meeting an unknown person? Think. Yes, sir. Two days before she died I saw a blue ambassador car leaving in a hurry. I saw someone lying in the back seat. In the front seat, there was one more man along with the driver. Can you recognise those people? I don't think so, sir. I couldn't see their faces. - Okay. Take his fingerprints and leave him. - Okay, sir. Come on. Your fingerprints are in our files. So next time, be careful. Don't get into trouble. And stop your business for a while. Okay, sir. Do some decent work, or else you'll be in trouble. Good evening, sir. - Is Mr. Anirudh here? Yes, sir. I'll call him. - Okay. Good evening, sir. Greetings, sir. If you had informed me, I would have come to the station. Can I get you anything to drink? No. I want some information. Sure, sir. You may ask me. That's my house on rent. So, you're not only running a hotel you are into human trafficking too. No, sir. This was just a mistake. Where did she belong? I don't know. But she came here from Kollam. How? You know, sir. To run my hotel, I had to get into this illegal business. My manager brought a few girls here. Kumudam was one of them. Does the manager still work here? No, he got a job in the gulf last month. He has gone there. What is his name? - Anthony. When was the first time she was here? Last October. From that day, she was in your custody, right? What do you mean? She was undertaking her businesses under your watchful eye and you were getting a commission for it, right? Sir, I'm not so cheap. Things weren't like that. Earlier, she used to stay in my hotel. Later, she shifted into that rented house. Sir, my manager used to deal with these things. I didn't have any direct contact with her. But I ignored these things to save my business. So, did you not go to her house? - No, sir. You never used to meet her either. Is that so? I used to meet her when she came to the hotel. I heard that she not only visited your hotel but other hotels too. Didn't you protest that? Not at all. I never interfered in her personal life. It's true that she lived in my hotel and moved into the rented house I gave her. Did she pay the rent herself? - Yes, sir. Was she earning well? Yes. She was a beautiful lady and was active in this profession. So, isn't it obvious, sir? So, she must have had a good bank balance too, right? I don't know about that, sir. You say your manager brought her here. Didn't he mention anything about her history? I don't think he knew much about her. We heard that she was a widow and was working in a finance company. After losing her job, due to the dissolution of the company she got into this business. That's all my manager told me about her. Do you think she had any enemies? No, sir. - Recently, you told her to leave this place, didn't you? I was.. You better be honest. You can't fool me. Which family was having trouble with this woman? How do you know? I know about it. Now, just answer my question. It was Mr. Simon, T.P. Simon. The owner of Alapit Timbers. Okay. This woman became his weakness. I hope you don't take this the wrong way. They met in my hotel. After that, he continued visiting her. Simon owns a big farmhouse. He used to spend time with her over there. But his family found out, and his wife got really angry. His wife's brother told me to warn Kumudam, or else things would get ugly. So, I told Kumudam about this and tried to warn her. But, I don't think she took it seriously. What is Simon's brother-in-law's name? Francis. Did Francis contact you after you warned Kumudam? - No. You had a connection with the woman who was murdered. Hence, you are a suspect too. Therefore, you'll have to co-operate with us. And you must visit the station whenever we need you. Sure, sir. I'll be there whenever you need me. Oh, I remember something. A few days ago, I believe it was a Thursday. S.I. Abbas called me on the phone and asked me about Kumudam's whereabouts. I don't know why. Mr. Abbas. Did you phone Malanar hotel, last Thursday and ask for Kumudam's address? No, I didn't. We didn't have information about them. Yes. I think it's someone else. Okay, sir. Is anyone there? Is anyone there? Who is it? I'm from Pakala. Are there no men in the house? Yes. My husband is sleeping. What's your husband's name? - Kuttappan. Kuttappan. Okay, go and get him. Who are you? - I'm here for an enquiry. Come here. Do you know this guy? Yes, he works in a wine shop next to the bus stand. Prince Wines, right? - Yes. Is he the same man? - Yes, sir. You'll have to come to the police station with me. I have to question you. - Who are you? I'm a poor old policeman. You can ask me your questions here. So, you are refusing to come to the station, aren't you? Sir, please. Let him go. Don't hurt him. Take him. - I'll come with you. I won't run away. Leave me. What? - Let me get dressed. - What is it, Kuttappan? Don't bother. Let's go! What's going on, Kuttappan? Don't worry. No one will touch me. Keep walking! Come on. She died between 9:00 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. There's a bruise on her forehead. It's not deep. It seems like she hit her head with great force. There was minor bleeding, not enough to cause death. There are strangulation marks on her neck. But it remains only an attempt. The main reason for her death is poisoning. It was consumed orally. She absorbed potassium cyanide in its powder form. And it was a speedy death. Strangely her forehead injury strangulation marks and consumption of poison all happened at the same time, within a span of 2 or 3 minutes. That means, there could have been more than one culprit. We can say that. What if one person tried to strangle her and the other one poisoned her? Possible. - And their motive? Sex is ruled out. There is no evidence of rape or molestation. Most importantly, these are my findings. Yes, Mr. Nainan. The poison which we found on the floor of her room is the same that the victim had consumed. As per the analysis, the poison was in that same bottle for two to three years. That means someone stored the poison in the bottle on purpose. We can assume that the injury on the victim's head was caused by the sharp wall next to the dining hall. There are some blood marks too. The victim struggled a lot near the dining area. And the alcohol? - That was whisky with a brand name. Those drinks and glasses have no sign of poison in it. The food on the table was not touched. Two glasses have been used for the drinks. One glass was left broken on the floor. And the other one was kept on the teapoy. Both these glasses had different fingerprints on them. Both did not belong to the victim. I believe it belonged to men. The same fingerprints were found on the alcohol bottles too. It's clear that the two suspects touched the bottles. Only two persons? A flower vase on the floor had the victim's fingerprints on it. Around the doorbell, there are blood marks and some fuzzy prints. This indicates there were many visitors at the victim's house. Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Ravindran, how are you planning to proceed? Let's assume that the fingerprints on the glasses and bottles belonged to the culprits. Outside the house, there are tyre marks of a jeep and a motorcycle. And we are trying to trace it. If it wasn't rape, then what could be the culprits' motive? Her ornaments were not stolen. That means it was not a case of robbery. There was an old leather box lying open in her bedroom. I'm not sure what that indicates. That box didn't look like it could protect anything expensive. In the box, I found a man's spectacle a few old diaries, notebooks and certificates. We are investigating in detail about it. The cap of the poison bottle was in that box. This case seems really complicated. Anyway, I wish you all the best. Sir, he's the one who bought alcohol bottles from Prince Wines. And he ordered food from Hotel Ansar that day. He answered a few questions. You may ask the rest. Come out. Stand here! What's your profession? - I'm jobless. He's jobless, but he likes expensive drinks and good delicacies. Rascal! Give him a tight slap! - Hey. How do you know that woman? I don't know any woman, sir. Then, who bought the drinks and food? I bought it for someone else. Oh, I see. Whom did you buy it for? Tell me! Ouch! I'll tell you, sir. - For whom did you buy it? For Mr. Simon. - How do you know him? I'm Mr. Simon's driver. She's my only daughter. So, I want this wedding to be a grand one. I hope we are not late. - Not at all. Please come. - Yes. You were supposed to reach yesterday. - Yes, sorry. We had relatives at home. - I see. Johnny? - That's right. I thought he left to America. - He'll leave day after tomorrow. That's why we couldn't come here. - I understand. Where is grandmother? Everyone's inside. Everything happened in a jiffy. Your daughter is lucky. - Hey, look who's here. We were expecting you yesterday. Sorry, Sally and Johnny had come to visit us. Where's Lissy? - She's inside. They will arrive by 11.30 a.m., right? Lissy, look who's here. Good morning, ma'am. - We are here, just like you said. You got an MBA graduate. - Get ready fast. They'll be here. Looks like there is an occasion here. Mr. Simon's daughter is getting engaged today. Where were you, Kuttappan? Simon has been looking for you from morning. What's the matter, sir? What did he do? Where is Mr. Simon? - He's inside, sir. Should we talk to him now? - Yes, I think so. What's wrong, Kuttappan? Mr. Abbas, what did he do? Why did you bring him here? You could've called me. This is Inspector Ravindran. I have not met you before. Why are you here? I want to talk to you in private. Not now. My daughter is getting engaged today. We can wait. - No, please leave. I'm not comfortable with you being here, right now. The police department doesn't work as per your convenience. Don't get smart with me. I know your superiors. Now leave. I'll meet you at the station when I'm free. We are not leaving unless you co-operate. Inspector, what do you want? What crime did the driver commit? He didn't commit the crime. - Was it me? You. - What crime? Do you want me to say that in front of all these people? I'll speak to you. Come in. It's okay, we can wait. Let's talk now. Please come. Prabhakaran Pillai. - Yes. Keep an eye on him. - Okay. Come here! What's the matter, sir? You'll be shocked. - Do you remember me? Lucas. What's going on here? Simon is accused of Kumudam's murder. What? - Yes. Oh, my God! Hey, there's a problem here. Mr. Simon is a suspect in the recent murder case. Look. Come on. The police just informed me. What's up, Lucas? - There's a problem, sir. I'll answer all your questions. But please leave now. Please do not humiliate me. Sir, they are here. Mr. Simon is coming. Why did you stop here? Please come in. We need to talk. - Come in, we'll talk. I don't think we're ready for this engagement. Sorry, but the engagement is off. Come, let's go. Keep it there. Take the car and go to the farmhouse. - Okay. I'll be there in an hour. - Okay. Close these windows. I wasn't sure if you were here. We had planned to meet tomorrow. But tomorrow, I have some very important work. Are you all right? Get ready. Let's go to the farmhouse. I'm sorry, I can't. - Are you expecting someone else? No. I am.. Then let's spend the night here. Get the glass and water. What is wrong with you today, Kumudam? I got some food. Serve it. Would you like a drink? It's fun to have a drink. I hope you don't mind, but I'm not well tonight. Can we do this tomorrow? I told you I'm busy tomorrow. You look fine. I won't stay long. Come on. Please, not tonight. I want you to leave. That's not fair. Come on. I told you, not tonight. What's wrong with you? Do you want more money? I'll pay you more. Just leave! Do you know who you are talking to? I do. And I don't care. Tomorrow, I will humiliate you in front of everyone. Are you threatening me? - Assume as you wish. Oh. You were scared that Kumudam will humiliate you. So, you and your driver came back and killed her. To make it look like a suicide you forced her to drink poison. Isn't this what happened? I won't blame you for saying that. But that's not true. Why don't you explain it to me? Maybe you didn't go back. But you could've hired someone to kill her. Inspector, I know I shouldn't have gotten into this relationship. We are humans and we make mistakes. But don't believe killing someone is a solution to any problem. But Bala, the cops couldn't find a clue about Kumudam's murder yet. It seems like Mr. Simon is going to be in trouble now. No, he'll pay the cops and get out of it. He is a millionaire. I think Simon hired someone to kill Kumudam. That's what everyone thinks. It's just his bad luck, nothing else. I also heard that Simon's family found about his affair. So, his wife's brother had hired someone to kill the woman. Are you sure that's him, Pappan? I saw his jeep in our area many times. Did you tell the cops about this? Ali, they asked me many times. But I just told them that I don't know anything. If we answer the cops, they will harass us even more. Who do you suspect, Pappan? - I suspect two young boys. Young boys? - Yes, college boys. Really? - After the murder I saw these boys near her house. You won't answer the cops, right? How do you know they are college students? I saw one of the boys at her place, many times. On two occasions, they have come to the shop taken soda and glasses and poured drinks for themselves. His name was Vishwan. He is an ex-minister's son and a student. Can you recognise the other guy who was with him? I don't think so. How long were they at the victim's house, that night? Yes, this is what confuses me. The boy I mentioned, first would spend more than two hours at her house. But that night, these boys visited her house and vanished within 10 minutes. Can you recognise their motorcycle? - Yes, sir. The number is easy to remember. 7000. Why are the cops here? What's going on? What's the matter, sir? Nothing much. Just came to meet you guys. Something is wrong. Nothing. Not seeing you upsets us. That's right. Even cops are human, right? They have a heart too. Oh, you seem to be a writer. Do you write stories or poems? Looks like you are in a good mood today. What did you call me? Don't you have any lectures to attend? I see. I'll call them. Should I inform the parents? - Not yet. Who is Vishwan? He travels on a bike. He's in the second year. His name is Vishwanath. Do you know someone who travels with him? That must be Gopakumar. He's in the same class. Call both of them. - Okay, sir. It is very unfortunate. We'll definitely help you. Thanks, sir. What's going on? Looks like they're in trouble. Police. The principal called you. - Hey, catch him! Hey, stop! Come with us! Move! - What did Vishwan do? Hey, come on. Silence, please! We can go to that room and talk. Move! - I request you all to be calm. The cops are here to investigate. Please keep silence! What's happening? Were you at Kumudam's house on Saturday night? No, we were not. But people saw you going to her house. We didn't go there, sir. Don't lie! We did go there, sir. - Be quiet, Vishwan. Quiet! - Why did you kill her? We didn't kill anyone! Stand there! Why did you kill her? We didn't kill her, sir. Then why did you go to her house? - I've been there before too. But I didn't go there, sir. - Be quiet! Be quiet! How do you know her? A friend introduced me to her. What's his name? - Ramdas. Where does he live? - At Kollam. What does he do? - He's into politics. His dad is a minister, right? Is his father also involved? Did your friend from Kollam visit her often? No. He met her once in a hotel, two months ago. She invited Ramdas to her house since they were acquaintances. Ramdas asked me to join him. That's how I know her. Did your friend not visit that woman again? No, sir. How many times have you visited her? About four or five times. - You've been there many times. She refused you, right? That's why you killed her along with your friend. I'll be in trouble if my dad finds out. - You deserve it. No, sir. Trust us. We didn't kill her. I don't believe you. - Sir, please. Why were you at her house with him on Saturday night? Gopan wanted to join me that night. He's lying, sir. - Be quiet! Continue. I knew what she was like, so, I didn't allow him to come with me. Last Saturday evening, we drank together. I asked him to join me at her place. What happened there? We were there around 8:45 p.m. It's me, Vishwan. Open the door. I don't think she's home. But the lights are switched on. Kumudam, open the door. It's Vishwan. Darn. Why isn't she opening the door? - I don't know. Let's sing her a song. Maybe then she'll answer. Okay. "How long have I waited for you" "I haven't heard any news of my beloved." "I have faith that she is not unfaithful." "The limit of.." What took you so long to open the door? Just leave! Why are you behaving like a stranger? Hey, meet my friend, Gopan. - I said, leave! Please don't disappoint us. - Leave! She will say that. But it's okay, come in. I said, leave! No, not yet. Get out! Now! That's all that happened, sir. - This is what happened at first. But after that, you got more drunk. And came back for revenge and killed her. No, sir. That's not true. - I don't believe you. Bring them to the station. - My dad will come to know, sir. Not just your dad, everyone will come to know. Come on! I don't think these students are involved in murder. Me too, sir. There are loopholes in Simon's version of the story. Since the drink that Simon brought was shared by two people then, it must be his friend or someone he hired to kill her. It is with these suspicions that I questioned Simon again. But he keeps saying that he was alone with her. Anyway, whoever was there that night, apart from Simon must be behind this murder. And you must find that man. Yes, sir. I found these papers in her bedroom. These certificates belonged to the victim. But this certificate has a different name, Susan Philip. Sir, these greetings are from 1982 by someone named Harshan. Women do change their names in this profession. I found out the address mentioned on this certificate. It's somewhere in Trivandrum. I'll visit that place tomorrow. On the way, I have to stop at Kayamkulam for an enquiry. This certificate is from St. Mary's school in Kayamkulam. This is Susan Philip's fee receipt. May I come in? - Come in. Take a seat. Who are you? - I'm Inspector Ravindran. Oh, your visit does not come as a surprise. I know you are here to investigate about that woman who was murdered. Today, after reading the newspaper I realised that I knew this woman. I was writing a letter to the inspector of the Alappuzha South Police Station. How do you know this woman, Father? Her son is studying here. How long has he been here? She admitted him here two years ago, in the year 1988. How old is her son? He's seven years old and studies in the 2nd grade. His name is Gopi. Do you know where she is from? Did she give you an address? She was from Kollam, where she was working as a receptionist. She told me that her husband died and they had no relatives to look after them. That's why she admitted her son here. Do you know her husband's name? No. Since she said he was no more, we did not ask. She didn't tell us either. Did she visit her son often? When she was in Kollam, she used to visit him once a month. When she visited, last August she said she found a job in Alappuzha. Following that, she would visit us every Saturday. Was she here last Saturday too? - Yes. That is the day she died. I know. But she was here to meet her son. Susan arrived around 11:00 a.m. and took her son out for a drive. They probably had their lunch outside. They were back by 3:30 p.m. Wow, you got so many goodies. Susan, he's a very good artist. His room is full of drawings. I want you to encourage him and make him a great artist. Definitely. We encourage talents. Gopi, go and attend the prayer. Study well, Son. Next time, I'll get your favourite comics. Go on. Susan, how's your work? I hope you are doing well, by the grace of God. Goodbye, Father. Her son is not aware that she's dead, right? Right. Because like I said, I got to know the news this morning, while reading the papers. I don't know how to break the news to her son. As a police officer, why don't you do it? I want to see him. - Come. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, Father. Please sit. Gopi, please come here. Come on. This man is here to see you. What happened, sir? - Nothing. I just came to meet you. You may go now. Don't tell him anything now, Father. Tell him before her funeral. Nobody has claimed the body yet. I'll let you know before her funeral. Father, let me know if you get any information. Especially, if anyone arrives to see Gopi. Sure. - Thank you. Is anybody home? Is somebody home? Is this Susan Philip's house? She's not here. We don't know where she is. Please leave. I'm not here for Susan. You are her father, aren't you? I need to talk to you about something important. I don't want to hear anything. She's not my daughter anymore. Who is it? Who are you? What do you want? I'm a police officer. I am here regarding an investigation from Alappuzha. Oh, my God. Even the cops are here to find her. Sir, she left our house eight years ago. We don't even know where she is. So, please don't bother us. We are not responsible for what she does. Open the door. Take a seat. Is she in jail? I'm here to give you some sad news. Your daughter, Susan, is dead. We suspect she was murdered. God punished her for abandoning us. She disappointed everyone. We are not sad that she's dead. We don't even want to see her dead body. My daughter! Where are you going so early in the morning? There is an exhibition of art at Fine Arts. Yesterday was the inauguration. It's fantastic, Dad. This is the first exhibition in our city. If you can, you must come and see it. It is probably too modern for me. I wouldn't understand. There are many famous painters in Trivandrum. I'm meeting them. There's a demonstration at 8:00 a.m by my boss from Calcutta. I don't want to miss that. Didn't your mom tell you? - No. Tell me what, Dad? We are having guests over tomorrow. You'll have to be at home. I'm sorry, Dad. Tomorrow is the last day of this camp. And I have to attend that. But who are the guests? They are coming to see you. What? Why do you decide such things without asking me? This was a sudden proposal. The boy works in a bank in Madras. He took leave from his work just to meet you. He has to leave day after tomorrow. That's why. Let's meet them some other day. I can't miss the camp. I gave them my word, dear. Why are you begging? You have spoiled her. That's why she never listen to us. Just do as we say. You're not going anywhere tomorrow. This is a good opportunity for you. I don't want to meet or get married to anyone. This is all your fault. You've never been strict with her. You give her too much freedom to go anywhere. Think about our society too. Thankamma, no one has said anything negative about her. She's educated and smart. She won't do anything that'll hurt us. She can take care of herself. I'm positive about that. Fine. Give her more freedom and let her stay unmarried. We should've asked her before inviting those people. Kids these days have opinions of their own. All right. Tell them not to come here. What else can be done? We don't have to do that. We should give Susan some time to think about it. Let's wait for her to get back. You will see. When we spoke to her about marriage her replies were similar to that of all girls her age. That's all I believed it was. But that's not how things were. I told you a million times, I don't want to get married. What do you want then? You are almost 22 years old. You are getting old. Sit down, dear. Do you love someone? Tell me. Are you happy now? I knew this would happen. Oh, God. Why are you overreacting? Are you saying she can live with whoever she wants? If the guy and his family are good then what's the problem? But we don't know anything about him. We will find out and decide. Oh, God. I don't know what will happen. Dear, tell me everything. You don't have to hide anything. Who's the boy? The both of you will not accept him. How can you say that without telling us, first? He's not a Christian. Isn't he? - He's a Hindu. - Oh, my Lord. What am I listening to? You witch! I will never allow this to happen! I'll kill you! - Hey, stop it! Sit down. This is the result of giving her too much freedom. Please calm down. Nothing has happened. I didn't expect this from you. You misused the freedom I gave you. You betrayed me today. No, I can't allow this. You are our only daughter. What happened to your modern values? You used to say man created religions and castes. You deserve this. This is all your fault. Where does he work? - He doesn't work. He's a painter. What's his qualification? - I haven't asked him that. Why do you care? Are you planning to get them married? What about his parents? He's an orphan. If you allow this, I will commit suicide. No, Annamma. I cannot allow this. Sorry, dear. I can't let you ruin your life. You must forget him. I know it's not easy. But you'll be fine. From now on, you'll stay at home. And yes, those people will be here tomorrow. If you like him, we'll finalise the alliance. Or else, we'll look for another. Tomorrow night, we'll leave to Kozhencherry. To my home. Let Susan live there for a month. But we couldn't. Because she left in the morning. She left a note. 'I'm leaving. I thought about it the entire night.' 'I had to leave, or I'd have to kill myself.' 'And I do not want to die now' 'because I'm pregnant.' 'I want to spend my life with the father of my child.' 'Please allow me to do so.' 'I know the world will blame me' 'but I'm just following my heart.' That's the last time we saw her. When she left, did she take her certificates along? Yes, she took her clothes and some important documents with her. Did she take anything expensive with her? She just had a gold chain. It was about one and a half sovereigns of gold. Is this your daughter's certificate? Isn't it? - Yes. Didn't you look for her when she left? We decided to believe she didn't exist. But we heard from people and relatives that she had registered her marriage and that she lives in Kollam with her son. Then, one day, someone told us that her husband died and that she's living with some other guy. When did you hear that news? About four years ago. - That means, in 1986. I am not so sure. - Didn't you get any other news? I did. When she got arrested in the case of prostitution. When was that? Around two years ago, I believe. From where? From a hotel in Kollam. Who told you about this? I read it in the newspaper. People started hating us after that. We lost our friends and family. Now, we are living here in shame. Everyone broke all ties with us. Out of fear of reading about her again I stopped reading the newspaper. We are very unlucky and cursed. I want to know something very important. It's been five days since her death. Her body is in the Alappuzha medical college mortuary. You can claim it and bury wherever you want. - No. No, we don't want to see her. Bury her anywhere. Think about it. Don't you want to see her for the last time? Ask your wife. I want her opinion too. Ask her. He is asking us whether we want to see her. I don't want to see her. I don't want to see her. As per law, the body will remain in the mortuary for two days. We will bury her after that. Sir. Who killed her and why? That's what we are investigating. Sir, where is Susan's dead body? Susan? Yes, it was in the papers. It's not Kumudam who died. It's Susan. I recognise the photograph. Go straight, take a right turn and ask someone there. The mortuary is over there. - Okay. We will have to bury her ourselves. When she was alive, she was in high demand. But when she died, nobody is here for her. It's tomorrow, right? - Yes. - Sir. I am here to find Susan's dead body. Where is she? Who are you talking about? The woman in this newspaper. Give me that. Where are you from? I'm from Kottarakkara. How are you related to this dead woman? She's not my relative. But she was very close to me. I heard that nobody has come to claim her body. I don't have much cash in my purse. I need your help. Where is her body? I want to see her. Just calm down. We'll take you to her. But first, answer our questions. What's your name? I'm Akkamma. How do you know her? I've been with her for many years. Were you her maid? - Yes. And when was that? During the time we were in Kollam. We have to show her the body. Gopala. Go with him. - Come. See how lucky I am. Her timing couldn't have been better. Even if you weren't here I wouldn't have sent her to the police station. That's not what I mean. Taking her to the inspector is a win for me. Is this the same woman? Nobody's going to harm you. Just tell us what you know. You said you were with this woman for four years, right? - Yes, sir. How did you meet her? I was working in a hospital in Kollam. I was the janitor there. Susan delivered her son there. She didn't have anyone to look after her. She told me that she doesn't have her family's support either. So, I decided to look after her. When she was discharged from the hospital she asked me to join her, so I went with her. Don't you have a family? My husband left to sail through the sea I have not seen him since. Was your husband a fisherman? - Yes. Was Susan's husband's name, Harshan? - Yes. Was he a painter? - Yes. Were they happy together? Even though they had financial problems they were happy together. Harshan was always busy painting. Susan supported him. Now I understand a mother's affection. I never got to experience a mother's love. She never cared for me. She abandoned me after birth. My father was probably an artist. That's how I got this talent. I used to draw on the walls of my orphanage. They punished me to end. When I was ten years old I was punished for stealing coloured chalks. They starved me for three days. Forget what has happened, Harshan. I am just glad I can give my son everything I could not get. He'll be a great artist, like his father. I'll give him everything. He'll not be deprived of anything. He doesn't like this apparently. - He must be hungry. I'll take him. Sit there. Susan, the day I met you was the most precious moment of my life. Your love made me realise that I'm not an orphan. I'm the happiest man in the world. You can't imagine. I know everything, Harshan. Nobody knows you better than me. The most precious moment of my life was when I met you. Only death can part us. You made a huge sacrifice for me. His paintings were not selling. They started to have financial problems. They lived by mortgaging things, and taking loans. His friends would help him with money. I must also mention that his friends were responsible for his death. They would drink endlessly. His friends used to bring alcohol over, all the time. There were five or six men, being loud and brash. Absolutely meaningless. That's why I say, don't be upset. An artist should never be upset. You must keep writing. No, I'm stopping. I won't write poems till the day I die. We won't let that happen. Why do you harass him? If he doesn't want to write, don't force him. Keep our food on the table. Have your dinner and go to sleep. It's 12:00 a.m. They will not leave soon. Akkamma, this pickle is great. Can I get some more? It's over. Harshan, it's very late. Don't you want to sleep? She's right. We should get going. They have to sleep. Can't we eat whatever is there? We don't have enough food. Don't be so formal with us, Harshan. We'll go out and eat. Hey, come on. Let's go. Is your wife asleep? I'll call her. Susan. Sorry for the disturbance. We're leaving. Goodnight. - Bye. Goodnight. - See you tomorrow. Let's eat? - Sure. I didn't realise the time. You must be hungry. Please take all the glasses to the kitchen. You can start eating. I want a few more drinks. You are so drunk. You started drinking in the evening. They are my friends. We were having fun. I'm not that drunk. Do you think I'm drunk? There are no tea leaves left for tea in the morning. Will black coffee do? We'll manage with that. We are out of baby food too. There's enough for one more meal. I'll buy it. If I'd known this, I would have borrowed some money from my friend. For how long do you intend to borrow money like this? How are we going to survive like this? These are the common problems in every house. We're not going to be poor forever. I abandoned my parents to be with you. I don't regret anything but we can't just wait for an opportunity. I understand what you are saying. I can't just go and ask people to buy my paintings. They should come to me. And that will happen. You will see. I've been thinking of finding a job. At least we'll be able to run this house. Susan was in search of a job for months. But she didn't find any. Their debts increased. Harshan's friends started avoiding him. They sold all their ornaments. Susan told me to leave and lead a good life somewhere else. But I couldn't leave Susan alone. I was very fond of her. What happened next? They were contemplating leaving the town. That's when they met Mr. Charlie. Is this Harshan's house? - Yes. Someone is here to see you. Hello. - Hello. I'm Charlie, the MD of Eastern Finance. Please sit. Mr. Darpan was your friend, right? Yes, he told me about you. He told me about your work. So, I came to see it. I liked it. - Thank you. Harshan, I want to talk business with you. Sit down. My company is undergoing a huge expansion. I saw the ad. Every week, we open a new branch. You haven't seen my offices yet, have you? I've styled them personally with modern and expensive decorations. I want your paintings in my office. How many paintings do you have here? Almost 20 to 22 completed paintings. I need at least 68 paintings. I'm very fast. Take your own time. But I want quality. This is Mr. Charlie. This is Susan. Charlie is the managing director of Eastern Finance. In simple words, a blade company owner. Please sit. Darpan told me that you both belong to different castes. Are you Catholic? Excuse me, can you ask my driver to get my suitcase? Along with a packet. Harshan, I adore beauty. If I want something, I'm ready to pay any amount for it. I spend a lot of money for art. I'm also investing in movies. I own a publishing company in Kottayam named Delta Publishing. Next year, I'm getting into film production in a big way. Pack the paintings that are ready. I'll send my man to pick it up tomorrow. This is just an advance. Let me know when you need more cash. - Thanks. This is a small gift from me. I will visit again. Bye. Their financial difficulties began to decrease. Do you know who Charlie is, sir? I do, he's a famous man. Oh, I just realised who he is. Do you remember how long his sentence was? Is he out of jail now? - It's not likely. He was convicted in 1988. He has to serve at least four years for his offence. He must be in the central jail. Is Mr. Charlie in jail? Why? People who ran blade companies are now in jail. Hello, 2968 here. Thiruvananthapuram, 65238. Not necessary, an ordinary would do. Yes, I'm the CI speaking. Okay. I was asking if he's still in jail. Just in case we need to see him Anirudh told me that he was working in a blade company at Kollam. So, Charlie offered Susan a job in his company, right? That was after her husband's death. When did he die? A year ago. When he started earning, he started drinking more. It wasn't just alcohol. He would consume all kinds of things that got him high. That started affecting his work. That's when they moved to another house. Mr. Charlie gave them that house. A big house. After moving in there, his old friends disappeared. But Harshan didn't quit drinking. Sometimes, he would stay away from home for two or three days. Cut the cake. I think he's here. It's Mr. Charlie. Hello, Susan. I got late due to a call from Bombay. Happy birthday to you. - Thank you, sir. Where is Harshan? This is for him. He left yesterday, sir. We don't know where he is. Have a piece. - Thank you. This is happening daily now. He must be with his friends. Don't worry, he'll be back. He has been drinking a lot lately. Even his behaviour is changing. He seems to be completely different. He fights with me for negligible issues. I've seen people who drink, but he is going overboard. I've been thinking of getting some medical help for him. I don't think it's that serious. He's an artist. I hope you don't take this the wrong way. Please don't bring any drinks here. Do not encourage him. Please help me save him. I'm sorry, I didn't know it was that serious. It's okay. I'm fine. Do you want me to join you? - Sure. Let's go now. - Come on. He's very drunk again. When did you arrive? - Just a minute ago. Dad, Mr. Charlie gave me this gift. Oh, I forgot about your birthday. Let's celebrate, Charlie. It's my son's birthday. Sorry, I got to go now. Susan, why didn't you tell me about his birthday? As if you'd remember. Darn. I completely forgot. It looks like you live for alcohol alone. Susan, to be honest I really want to stop drinking but I can't. You can quit drinking, if you really want to. I will try, Susan. I will try. Who's there? - There was a bottle here. Harshan, it's you. What bottle? A bottle of brandy. You have finished it all. No, I didn't. There was a little left. What are you doing? Where's my bottle? Oh, my God! Harshan. I'm going out. - At this hour? I want a drink. The shops must be closed. - No, I want a drink. Let me go. - Harshan, please don't go. Harshan, listen to me. - Leave me! I want a drink or I'll die. Please leave me, Susan. You don't know, I'm helpless. Please! Relax, dear. After that, it started getting worse. He started to lose his mind. Finally, Mr. Charlie took him to a doctor. But he wouldn't take his medicines. Alcohol was his medicine. Sometimes, he'd leave the house and return after many days. One day, he left the house. And this time he didn't return home even after a week. Do you have any information, my dear? Nobody knows where he went. I've asked almost everyone, but nobody saw him. Why don't you tell Mr. Charlie? He has a lot of contacts. He'll find him. He's out of town. I'm sorry, I was in Mumbai. I came to know about Harshan this morning. So, I took the next flight here. Due to the heavy rains, I got late. Is there no news from him? We've searched for him everywhere. Did you inform the police? Don't worry, he'll be back. I'll do my best to find him. I'll try to find him through all my contacts. Don't worry. Give me just 24 hours. Mr. Charlie searched for him almost everywhere. Even the police searched for him. They didn't find him. I cursed the day Susan decided to marry a man like this. We can't fight destiny. That's just her fate. After a month, somebody found a dead body on a railway track. The papers described it as an unknown person. So, Mr. Charlie went there to identify the dead body. The railway police waited for four days. I reached just in time for the cremation. Susan lived only for her son, Bobby. I somehow managed to handle her grief. If I go back, my parents won't accept me. What if they are waiting for you, dear? You don't know my mom and dad. It's Mr. Charlie. Hey, dear. I didn't forget about you. I wasn't here for a while. Please come in. - No, it's okay. You must learn to overcome your pain, Susan. It's not that easy. Sorry. I know you must be strapped for cash. Please don't hesitate to tell me if you need anything. If you don't mind you can work in my company. I'll pay you well. Thanks. I'll always be grateful to you. He not only gave her a job but also provided her with all requirements. He loved Bobby like his own son. He married Susan soon after, didn't he? I don't know about that, sir. It did look like they would get married. They were getting close. Why did you leave Susan's house? My younger sister in Kottarakkara had met with an accident. She had three little kids. I went there to look after them. Didn't you return to Kollam? I did, a year ago. I went to enquire about her. But the house was locked. They had moved out. Hello. I need to talk to the jailer. I'm Inspector Ravindran, from Alappuzha. We'll need the court's permission to question him, right? Yes, we need some information about a convict. Charlie. Blade. What? Oh, I see. For how many days? Okay. He's out on parole for 2 weeks. He was out the day she was murdered too. I see, that's why he was out. He must have run away, sir. The blue ambassador car? - Exactly. He must have gone back there. We need to proceed with the case from here. We must trace the places that he went to. Let's begin at Kollam. - I'll make the arrangements, sir. There's no doubt. He's the one who murdered her. What are they saying? Did Mr. Charlie kill Susan? Oh, Lord. My dear! My daughter. I want to see my daughter. My baby! What about this child? - Let him stay with me. That's what the police suggested. You know what to do. - Yes. They shouldn't find the blue documents, at any cost. Hide it somewhere else if you want. Sir, what about the other property? Meet Advocate Aiyyar. - Okay. Number? - 5860. Name? - Charlie Jacob. Father's name? - K.C. Jacob. House name? - Manthopil. Crime? - Cheating. Punishment? - Two and a half years. When did you get the parole? - On April 20th. This is the circle inspector from Alappuzha. He's here to question you. He has permission from the court. Go and change your clothes. I know what you plan to ask me. The fellow is tough. My alibi is perfect. From April 20th till yesterday I have all details about the places I went to and the things I did in this diary. Here, take a look. Do you write in your dairy often? Or is it only when you are out on parole? I've been writing in my diary for many years. So, if I ask you something from the past you might have to refer to your diary. Am I right? No, I have a sharp memory. - Good. So tell me, did you marry Susan after Harshan's death? No. - Does that mean you were just living together? Sir, I can explain that. Go ahead. But tell me the truth. I know what exactly to tell the police. I have nothing to hide. I'm glad. Let's hear it. To be honest, from the day I met Susan, I have wanted her. But after Harshan's death I offered her a job in my company I know. But things weren't that easy. I tried to approach her but in a polite manner. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon, sir. - Good afternoon. Which one? Fine, let them withdraw it. Look, he's a perpetual nuisance. We don't have to entertain such depositors. Good afternoon. Please come here. What is new with you? Nothing much. - Please sit. I never buy anything while going on tour. I have no one to give it to. But this time, I felt the need to purchase something. This is for you. I'll be happy if you accept it. Greetings. You didn't inform me about your arrival. It was a sudden program. The minister is in Trivandrum. He is on his way to Ernakulam. He has come here just to meet you. She is with us. There's a situation. They want one packet now. An entire packet? Only the ornaments from the K locker. They also need the legal documents of 'Kunnamkulam'. No problem. K Locker ornaments. Do you know where the documents are? - Yes. It's in the VIP locker. There are initials on the cover. CCM, be careful. - Okay. Who is she? The one you mentioned.. - No, not her. You've been busy lately. What's up? Don't you know? The elections are in January. I heard. Can I get you anything to drink? No, thanks. Convey my regards to the minister. - Sure. Wait. Meet me before you go home. - Okay. Please sit. Are you still afraid of people? Don't you think I should be? You were fearless when you were in love. That was all because of Harshan. He was my courage, trust and confidence. Today, I don't even feel I exist. But only because of my son.. Your life isn't over yet. I've always wanted to ask you this but I didn't have the guts. Haven't you ever thought about marriage? The circumstances in which I had grown up my attitude towards life, a wife and kids never got me thinking about marriage. Maybe I just wanted to earn and be successful. That's why I couldn't focus on other things. But now I feel like I have changed a lot. It's okay. I did think about getting married and having a family. But everything went wrong. My plans started to foil. I gave you the money I saved for my daughter's marriage. That was my hard work. Now, you refuse to return my money nor interest. I've been waiting for eight to nine weeks. We're not leaving without our cash. You think you could fool me with your big office and expensive car. - Please wait. Let me explain. I'm not paying you because I don't have the money. There are some new restrictions by the government. This problem will be solved in two weeks. They say they will close down all blade companies. Politicians will say anything to get votes. What do you want us to do? Please don't worry. Your money is safe with me. We will wait for another two weeks. I'll have to deal with this problem for a few more days. Yes, Charlie speaking. Oh, Mr. Vidhyadharan, I'm stuck in a big problem here. If you withdraw that much, I won't be able to survive here. Eastern Finance will be destroyed. All my employees are threatening me. What do you want me to do? Should I leave the country? You know my predicament. We talked about this last time. Okay. I'll meet you in person. At your convenience, okay? I'll have to leave for Thiruvananthapuram tonight. Are you joining me, Susan? You can take Bobby along, for a change. Which room is Mr. Vidhyadharan staying in? - 127. What about my room? - It's ready, sir. Please sign here. I am the right hand of the minister. I'll do anything for this man. Mr. Vidhyadharan, I can't argue with you. But think about my company's condition. Everyone wants to take back their shares. I will have to pay back the small shareholders and prove my company's credibility. In the process, if we withdraw huge amounts it'll be a veritable shipwreck. My company will be finished. Right now, only you can save me from this crisis. Please help me. The minister already has enough of his issues. The opposition party tried to slap allegation charges on us. But we somehow handled them and settled everything. Now, we can face them. I feel like going away from all this stress for a while. I wanted some peace and a relaxing nap. I told you to go on a vacation. We have guest houses in Ooty and Bangalore. No. The elections are coming up and I'm busy with that. We might win or lose. Although, I'm not scared of losing. Politicians never lose. Businessmen like us fail. If you move wisely, you won't lose either, Charlie. This is all the wisdom I have. - No. You have enough wisdom, more than required. You just need to understand things. Come here. Come on. The minister is leaving tonight, so if you want, you can meet him. Following that, even I'll talk to him. If you try, he can help me out. Let me see. But you also need to help me. What did he say? Everything will be fine. When are we going to the zoo? We will go, dear. Why are you drinking tonight? Just for a change. Sit down. Reception. Please tell my driver to come here. You look upset, Charlie. Yes, Susan. I'm just worried about my company. All my hard work is at stake right now. Sir. Ananda, take Bobby to the zoo and the beach. Mom, come with us. Go and have fun, Son. Charlie. - What is it, Susan? How can we live like this? Let me deal with this problem. We'll go on a trip to Nepal. I just need to solve this matter, first. Your friend will help you, won't he? He's a good friend, a well-wisher. He's the reason for my successful business. And now only he can help me out of this mess. How? My problems will be solved if you can help. What do you want me to do? I'm going out to speak to the minister. He won't allow me. I'll be gone for two hours. Those two hours are very precious. Only you can handle it. This man can save our company's future. We must be cautious about that. Susan, this will stay between the three of us. Now I get it. It's just a matter of 2 hours. I know you now. No, you don't know me yet. - I don't have to. I'm leaving. - Where to? Go away. - You have to wait for your kid. If you want him back, you'll have to obey me. Or else, you'll lose your son. Got it? I am on the brink of destruction. I'll do anything to save my business. You haven't seen the real Charlie. And your son.. I will kill him. So, just obey me. Vidhyadharan was only one of the first, right? To save your company, you asked Susan to compromise again. Like I said, I don't want to lie. You are right, I was using Susan to save my business. She was really upset with what she had done. She even told me that she will commit suicide. It's not easy to live in this world. Learn to survive. Now, get up and get dressed. We have to leave. - No! Look, I can do anything to get what I want. But nobody could save my company. After the elections, the new government had been set up. That's when things got worse. At first, I tried to manage. But later on, I was not able to pay my employees. One by one, my branches started winding up. I had to accept defeat. I had to hide somewhere. I'm in trouble. The police can arrest me at any time. Please keep this safe. What's this? Some of my property papers and secret accounts details. Nobody should know about this. Even if I go to jail, I won't be there for long. When I come back, I'll start a new business. This is the investment for that. I can trust only you right now. The police will be here too. But don't let them get it. I'm leaving. How is life? I'm just learning to live my life. See you later. So, on 28th, you reach Alappuzha and ask her for the property papers and she refuses to give it to you. Correct, but I went to meet her on the 26th. How did you know that she was in Alappuzha? My friends informed me. I came to know that she was into prostitution at Malanar Hotel in Alappuzha. But I didn't have her address. So, I had to trick the hotel manager. You made a phone call as a police inspector, right? So, you found out. You went there in a blue ambassador car, right? - Yes. You didn't expect me, right? I knew you would come. I didn't know your address. My documents and.. Don't worry, it's safe with me. I must show my gratitude where it is due. You may go now, Charlie. Where is your son? - That's none of your business. Let's go. Charlie, you lied about something. She didn't give those documents to you. On 28th, you went to her house again. I killed her and ran away with my documents. That's what you mean, right? - Yes. Anyone would have thought the same thing. But what I have stated is the truth. But you are still hiding something, Charlie. The story about you recognising a dead body as Harshan.. In reality, you killed Harshan and left him on the railway track. Then you made Susan believe that her husband is dead by telling her he died in an accident. But Harshan isn't dead, sir. What? - There's a mental asylum in Mysore. Dr. Koshi's mental clinic. Harshan is admitted there. When he lost his mental balance completely I admitted him to that hospital. It would have been useless to take him back home in that condition. Like I said, I was interested in Susan. Dr. Koshi's mental clinic? - Yes. Yes? I'm from the Kerala Police Department. Take your seat. - Thank you. How can I help you? You have a patient named Prasad. The painter? - Yes. - He's gone. When? - About a week ago. Rema, get Prasad's medical file. Why are you looking for him? His wife is dead. It's a murder. Oh, God! Do you think he did it? He can't be. He's a gentleman. Last month, on 20th, he had gone to Kollam. Then, he returned on the 1st. After two days, he left again. Then I came to know whatever cash he had in his account was taken with him. Where did he get this money from? He earned it by selling his paintings. His work was much appreciated in Mysore. Was he mentally stable when he left the institution? We wouldn't let him go otherwise. He was brought here in a terrible condition. He was admitted here in June, 1986. A man named Ramachandran brought him here. He had a French beard. He sent us money regularly for about two years. But then it stopped. His brain was affected due to the intake of alcohol and drugs. So, he needed almost three years of treatment to get better. One day, he asked me for some colours and a brush. We gave it to him. He started painting. They were fantastic. He signed them as Harshan. I believe that was his real name. I see. He must have killed her and absconded with the money in his bank. He could be anywhere. I don't think it's easy to find him now. What are you going to do? I believe he is here, in Kerala. He will definitely be here to meet his son. Yes. He's here. Just a minute. It's S.I. Abbas. Hello? When? Okay, I'll be there. I was right. Where is he, Father? - Come. For the past three days, Harshan has been coming here to meet his son, Bobby. My staff told me about it. - Okay. This morning, at around 10 a.m., he told me that he wants to adopt Bobby. I said I'm fine with it. For further formalities, I asked him to be here at noon. That's when I informed you. He came half an hour back. I asked him to prepare an application. What did he say his name was? - Prasad. Harshan. You didn't expect us here, right? You are Susan Philip's husband, Harshan, right? You are under arrest for killing your wife. Even though we just met, we know everything about you. I can also understand the reason that you killed your wife. Do not try to hide anything. Last month, on 20th you travelled from Mysore went to Kollam, right? Am I right? Yes. Susan. There is no Susan here. What a nuisance! What do you want? - A lady who lived here.. We have been living here for the past year. We don't know anything about the previous family. People are always harassing us about her. I told you we should move out of here. I don't think it'll be profitable for us. We won't get anything more than Rs. 650 for it. - Okay. Hey, take a seat. Where was the depository? - There wasn't a depository. Have you seen Mr. Charlie? Do you know the MD of the company? - Yes. You haven't heard. He's in jail. Do you know where Susan Philip is? She used to work here. She was his mistress. When Charlie was arrested, she got into prostitution. She was here, in Kollam, a year or two ago. Now, she lives in Alappuzha. A man who was here told me that. With that information, I travelled to Alappuzha. I was relieved that nobody could recognise me. I stayed in many places with different names. I tried to find her. But I couldn't. Finally, one Saturday morning.. Do you know where she lives? I don't know her address. I have heard she was living near the church junction. Where is that? It's towards the highway, one kilometre ahead. I asked around and finally, found the house. With the hope of meeting her I waited there. It was about 7 p.m. I was sure that it was Susan, so I followed her. Who is it? Please leave. I'm going out. Susan. Harshan! Is it really you? Where were you all these years? Where did you go? What happened to you? It was Charlie. He betrayed us. Really? What did he do? I went insane. I couldn't think straight. He trapped me, far away from here. He admitted me into a mental asylum in Mysore. Susan. I never thought I'd see you again. I missed you so much. Susan. I'm not your Susan anymore. I know. Don't tell me anything. I don't want to hear it. Where is our son? He's good. - Where is he? He's in a hostel. I met him today. You, please sit. I'll get you tea. Please sit. Don't sit here, Harshan. Go to that room. Go on, please. Aren't you ready yet? I told you to be ready by 7.30 p.m. I'm not coming tonight. You may go, Mani. What's wrong? Are you unwell? Yes, I am unwell. It's okay. He's your old client. Just spend some time with him and be back soon. We can't disappoint this client. He asked me to arrange you, a week ago. I gave him my word. Come on, get dressed. I'll wait. No, Mani. I can't come tonight. How can you say that? My promises have value. Just meet him and come back. I'm not coming. Please leave. What's wrong? Is someone here with you? I'll give you some privacy. I can come back after half an hour. No, just leave. This is not good. I'll have to find another girl now. Your other client from Kozhikode will be here tomorrow. Harshan, go away. Don't stay here. What are you saying? I want to be with you. Let's take our son and move somewhere else. Please, Susan. No, I can't live with you now. No, don't say that. Forgive me. Give me one more chance. I should be apologizing to you. I am the one who's ruined. I am the reason all this happened to you. - Don't say that. I don't care what happened. You are my Susan. No, I am not the same Susan anymore. She's dead. I'm Kumudam now, a prostitute. I told you I don't want to hear it. Please! You shouldn't have come here, Harshan. Leave! I can't live without you, Susan. I can't think of a life with you. I don't care about your past. Let's forget everything. Let's forget everything the past and raise our son together. I wasn't sure if I would meet you here. I told you I would meet you tomorrow. But tomorrow, I have some very important work. Are you okay? Get ready. Let's go to the farmhouse. I'm sorry, I can't. - Are you expecting someone else? No, I am.. Fine. Let's spend the night here. Get the glass and water. What happened to you today, Kumudam? Didn't you hear me? I brought food. Serve this on a plate. Would you like a drink? Sometimes, it's fun to have a drink. I hope you don't mind, but I'm not well tonight. Can we do this tomorrow? I told you I'm busy tomorrow. You look fine. I won't stay long. Come on. Please, not tonight. I want you to leave. That's not fair. Come on. I told you, not tonight. What's wrong with you? Do you want more money? I'll pay you more. Just leave! - Do you know who you are talking to? I do. And I don't care. Tomorrow, I'll humiliate you in front of everyone. Are you threatening me? - Think whatever you want. Fine. No! Harshan. - Stay away! Don't! - Let go! I will drink. I want to forget everything. I don't want these memories. Please don't, Harshan. - Who are you to stop me? You are nobody to me now. I know that now. Please. I thought I could forget everything and start all over again. I thought I'll get my old Susan back. But I'm a fool. I don't have a life now. I am the one with no life. But you have a life. You have to raise Bobby. You must live together. Our son shouldn't know that I was a prostitute. Don't drink, Harshan. For our son's sake. He's at St. Anthony school in Kayamkulam. You must go and meet him. You must live together, somewhere far away. And I.. It's me, Vishwan. Open the door. I think she's not home. But the lights are switched on. Kumudam, open the door. It's me, Vishwan. Why isn't she opening the door? Let's sing a song for her. Maybe then she'll open it. "How long have I been waiting for you?" "I haven't heard any news of my beloved" - No. "I have faith that she is not unfaithful." "Then what is the reason.." "I have faith that she is not unfaithful." "Then what is the reason.." Where were you? Go away! - Don't be like this. Don't behave like a stranger. Meet my friend, Gopan. - I said, leave! Please don't disappoint us. - Go away! Hey, let's get in. Go away! We are not leaving. Get out! I want to die. Don't do this, Harshan. Don't! Leave me! I will kill you! You must die! You must save yourself from this hell. I'll die too. Let our son grow as an orphan, like me. Open the door, Susan! Open the door, Susan! Open the door, Susan! Forgive me. Open the door! Let's go somewhere else. Forgive me, Susan. I'm not mad at you anymore. Let's go somewhere. I can't go with you, Harshan. You will have to go alone. Susan. Susan? I lost my soul a long time ago. The moment I was betrayed I have wanted to die. But I lived only for my son. But when I saw you alive.. Oh, my God! - Susan. Susan. I love you, Harshan. Please don't forget me. Susan. Don't stay here. Go away. - No, Susan. This is a prostitute's house. You shouldn't be here. Please go. - No, Susan. Take care of Bobby. Take him far from.. No. Believe it or not this is what happened. I hope this is the truth but we still need to prove it in the court. Until then, I can't release you. Come on. I want to see my son. Bring Bobby here. What happened to you, Mr. Prasad? I'm not Prasad, dear. I'm your father. Yes, your father. Mom? I want to come with you. I'll come and take you with me some other time. When? After a few days, I promise, I'll be back. 'EE KANNI KOODI'
