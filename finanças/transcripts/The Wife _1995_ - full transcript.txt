MAN (OFFSCREEN): (SINGING) Look at me, sad, pink eyes, floppy ears. Love disguise, but in my heart, I'm a lion. Rita? Wait up! I was just kidding! It was a joke! I'll sing your favorite song! I'll sing the rabbit song! (SINGING) Please let me love you! Just let me try! My heart will be happy. I'll smile when I die. [music playing] -Honey,why don't-- why don't we take a nap before dinner? [phone ringing] [phone ringing] RECORDING: The doctors are not in. Please leave a message. If you are in crisis, you could call Dr. Jacobi, who is covering for us at 555-3352. Thank you. [beep] MAN (OVER PHONE): Rita and Jack, it's Bill. Um, I, I know it's late, and it's, uh, Sunday. I just, um, yeah, maybe I will call, uh, that doctor, um, I'll call back. I didn't write his number down. I, uh-- oh, I don't know, I just-- it's the thing with breathing again. I, uh, don't know-- -You startled me. -No, I was just watching. Is there anything to drink? -I still-- I still have a DC, but there's, um, a bottle of red that you can-- -Sure. Can I do anything, or-- -No, I think everything is pretty much under control. -Music, or-- -Um-- -We don't, we don't have to. -No, something not too wild, maybe. -OK. -Have you seen the little sauce pan? -You what? -The little sauce pan. Have you seen it? -Oh, the pan. Jesus. -What did you think I said? -I, uh, don't ask. What? -I'm sorry. -What? -No, you're funny. -I, I don't think that-- -No, I mean it. It's OK. -It's-- it was really great being here alone all weekend. Did you, um, did you get antsy? -No, no, no. -Because I remember that the last bad time, you know, that, that weekend that we had, uh-- -What? -I'm just, um, tired. No, when-- when I think about how close we almost came that time, well, I just, um-- I just thank god that we took the time and got help. -Did you wear your sun block today? -Jack, it's the winter. -I don't know. The sun reflects off the snow. -No! Don't you-- you don't think-- -This is kidding. Come here. -I just want to be close to you, that's all. Don't pull away. I can feel you pulling away. -Oh, no. I saw headlights down the end of the drive. -You don't have to make something up. Saying that you don't want to be close is a way of being close. -Right. I, I saw them when I came down before. I just thought it was a car turning around, and-- -It was probably just some Sunday drivers lost. -Right. It's-- I don't like it. -What are you doing? -Don't worry, I'll take care of it. -Jack, if you're worried, just call the police. -I'm not worried. -Honey? -(ANGRILY) What? MAN (OFFSCREEN): It's clear! I mean-- -Hello? MAN (OFFSCREEN): --every relationship you've ever had. Just look at your family. WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Don't you bring up my family. I've told you, no family. You are my family now. My fucking family has nothing to do with you. MAN (OFFSCREEN): It's me, everybody! It's Cosmo! -Cosmo? -Yeah, just me. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Our Cosmo? WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Your family have some great-- COSMO (OFSCREEN): Well, we'll be on our way. WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Don't make me laugh. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Are you all right, Cosmo? COSMO (OFFSCREEN): I, I know this looks crazy. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Quit calling me crazy. COSMO (OFFSCREEN): I'm not calling you crazy. MAN (OFFSCREEN): Try that, big man. I dare ya. WOMAN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah What are you gonna do? What? COSMO (OFFSCREEN): Will you be quiet? Will you shut up? -No! No! -What's going on? -No, nothing. Nothing. I mean, we were just out shopping, and you know, I always talk about you two so much, so I wanted to show Arlie the house. Then the car stalled. -Hi. I'm wifey. JACK (OFFSCREEN): I'll check the security system. -Rita, I am so sorry. I mean, I just-- -No, no, no, no. -I hope we're not interrupting anything. -I was just a little concerned. -Concerned? Well, don't be concerned. I mean, this whole thing is just, I mean, you know, there's no significance to it. Sometimes things just happen. I mean, it's a spur of the moment thing. Arlie was driving. -Calm down. -It's OK. -Well, I know. I mean, I just-- -This is just how I pictured it. -Just, I know how you must feel. -Really? -Oh, yeah. -He talks about the two of you all the time. -Flow. Right. But I mean, but I mean, this was not my kind of flow. I mean, this flow is hardly my idea. -Hey, is this where it happened? -Yeah, this is where it happened. -Jack? -I mean, it's just how I pictured it. -Arlie? -Is this OK? -Oh, please. Please. -I love your outfit. I mean, the whole look. -Oh, right, the outfit. I-- it's required to get your license. ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): That's funny. Cosmo told me you were funny. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Hello? COSMO (OFFSCREEN): Arlie? -Oh, we're in here. This is where you do it. Jack's been telling me all about it. This is really great here. You were so right, honey. -Well, I think Jack and Rita probably want to, uh-- -Hey. Did you do everything yourself, or did you have people come in? -Well, it was mostly Jack and I. -Oh, god, this is so great here. Honey? Look at this. He looks like you, baby. Cosmo. God, he's so highstrung. I keep telling him, his head's gonna pop like a balloon one of these days. But I suppose you know that better than anyone. -Well. I guess we'll be off. -It was really nice of you to stop-- -But we just got here. -Yeah, we just got here. Oh, that's right, I live here. I knew you looked familiar. -What? What? -Jack's an incredible kidder. He's always joking. -Salsa. -What? JACK (OFFSCREEN): It's a sauce. -Well, as I was saying, we're on our way. -What's your hurry? -Could I get you something with your outfit, Arlie? -What? With my outfit? -Yes. He's joking. One of his jokes. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Honey? -Jack? -What did he mean about my outfit? -Arlie! -Could you calm down before your head pops, and you're flopping around on the floor like a fish? RITA (OFFSCREEN): This is utterly inappropriate. My uncle Sully-- -Would you stop with the head popping thing all the time? JACK (OFFSCREEN): They came over, they're gonna leave. Don't worry. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Jack. -Don't touch anything. RITA (OFFSCREEN): We're his therapists. -You mean I can't touch anything? RITA (OFFSCREEN): Tell him this is inappropriate, and that we'll offer him an hour. JACK (OFFSCREEN): What do you think of wifey? RITA (OFFSCREEN): She's not our client. JACK (OFFSCREEN): Is she anything like you thought she'd be? RITA (OFFSCREEN): Jack-- -And that dress? It's amazing. -Do it, and we could be open to malpractice. -Malpractice? Rita-- COSMO (OFFSCREEN): Oh my god, what's in here? ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): Look at all those weird CDs. -Yeah, Jack collects those. -Wow. How unusual. -Don't you think we should just go? -Oh, but that's rude. -Yeah. -They won't mind. -I mean, you wanted to meet them. Now you've met them. -It's just that this is fun. -I know, baby, buy you don't understand. I mean-- -No, please, dad. -See, you don't get it. -I'll [inaudible] for everything when we get home. Oh, hi. -Hi. -It's really great that you have so many CDs. CDs. Yeah. Right. OK, dear, let's go. -I just want to say goodbye to Rita. -Jack, I know this is completely inappropriate. I mean, I don't want you to think-- -Need any help? -Well, I wouldn't want you to feel You don't need to feel. -And you don't want me to think. What do you want me to do, Cosmo? -Wow, where'd you get it? This is really-- -Come on, Jack. I'm being serious. -Really? -In Mexico. -You've been to Mexico? -Uh-huh. -Now she's in there with Rita. -Wow, I've never been there. -Oh, well it's very nice. -Yeah, I heard that, you know? With all the, the people, and the-- -Let's talk about this. -The food, and the music. -I just find it very upsetting that when she wanted to come over here, and I don't know why. -Well, is it possible that you needed to come over here? -No, no! I-- she has been pushing me and pushing me to-- no, no! [laughter] -So you do it in here, huh? -I'm sorry? -The group. It's a sitting around on the floor kind of thing? -A sitting around on the floor kind of a thing? -Yeah, you just sit in a circle, like. -Well, no, it's a-- it's a process. It's a little bit, you know, it's difficult to describe. -Right. Right. - --has been making things very, very difficult for me at home, and Arlie is beginning to sense that. -No, no, not exactly. -I mean, I don't know if I should ever have started exploring this whole area. I mean, you know those feelings that I've been trying so hard to get to? I've gotten to them. -That's good. -Here you go. -I mean, I know they must be somewhere inside me. They always have been, I'm sure. But I mean, now they're actually starting to-- -Were you really going to have something? -What? -I could tell you didn't want me to taste the sauce. -Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry, I went to a cooking school a couple years ago, and they got us in the habit of tasting the sauce from a spoon that never goes into your mouth. -I mean, what's the worst that could happen if you let yourself feel this? --That your mouth can put that can have an effect on the sauce if you pour it from one spoon to another. It's-- -Well, Jack, I mean, there are a lot of-- -Just think of the worst thing. -Well, I don't feel comfortable talking about this. I mean, Arlie is right in the next room. -I appreciate that. It's just-- -You're so pretty. -Hang on. -Thank you. -Like a big doll. So pretty. -Honey, um, I'm gonna take Cosmo for a short walk. -Hey, can I see you in there for a minute? -Excuse us. -Sorry. -What? No, it's OK. Just go in the kitchen. Please. -Take your time. We're doing fine. -Thanks. -Arlie. -Shh. -You can't do that. -Jack, I, I thought that we agreed? -Rita, I really feel this is the breakthrough I've been looking for with Cosmo. -They're talking about you. Don't you want to hear what they really think of you? -I know what they think of me. -I don't know. Considering the context, I just don't see how that's possible. -Well-- I don't know if I really see a context, aside from us helping him. And-- -Oh, they just said-- -I don't want t know what they said. I want you to get away from there. -And what about us? I mean, we've looked forward to this day. Just, just us-- -Christ! I thought this whole thing was about openness and sharing. -See, this is exactly why I-- -It'll be OK. Just let me do this. -It's not for me to let you. I just, I really don't feel good about this. -Right. I know. I just-- it'll be OK. I just want to do that. I want to take care of them, and him, and it'll be OK. -Great! -Honey, just don't worry. Relax. -What? -Shh! -What are you doing, shushing me? You do this everywhere we go. I was putting on and really had a good time. -Yeah, where are we going? We haven't gone somewhere. We haven't been invited. -OK-- -Excuse me. -Sorry. -Um-- why don't you and I take a walk? Just the two of us, and talk a little? Thanks. Be right back. -Bye, bye! Bye, bye! [humming] [humming] -Men talk, I guess. So people say all kinds of crazy shit? -I'm sorry? -The, um, group thing. You know? -I, um, I wouldn't call it crazy, but I-- -Yeah, wow. And you two kind of, you know, set everyone straight? You know, advice wise and all that? -Well, um, advice isn't really how I'd put it. I mean, we, um, we give people a chance to feel safe with their thoughts and their feelings. To kind of help them find their way, but it really isn't advice. -And people must get involved with each other? -Involved? -Well, you know, I mean, shit must happen. I mean-- well, you're saying all this stuff, and, then I'm sure people are crying, and carrying on about all their secret thoughts. And then, you know what I mean. -Go on. -It's so cool how you say that. I can feel it. I mean, they teach you that in school, or what? -Well, I'm not sure that I-- I think what you're sensing is something that comes from experience. I mean, we, we do this all the time, so you kind of get a feel for it. It's a way of connecting, I suppose. -Yeah, yeah. Feel. Right. I know that, that connecting thing. -Really? -Yeah. I was a, I was a dancer. I understand something about connecting. -Really? A dancer? Well, I guess that's a similar sort of a thing. -Yeah. Pretty cool. -Yeah. Pretty cool. -Do you have anything to drink? -Um, a DC? -Huh? -Diet Coke? -Jack, where we going? ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): No, I meant something to drink. -Can you feel it? -Oh. Um-- -Oh, you don't have to. I mean, Cosmo's nervous, and I guess you people probably have ideas about everything, so you're probably right. -What would you like? -A beer would be great. -Let me see. Here we go. Do you want a glass? -No, no. Bottles, cans. Hey. Oh, Christ, that's better. Can I help do something or something? -No, no, I think everything's pretty much under control. -I'll set the table. -No, really, it's fine. -No, no, I'm itchy, you know? -Plates are right there. So you're, uh, a dancer? -No, I quit that. -Really? Well, um, what do you do now? -Nothing much. -Because I-- I knew that you didn't have any kids, so-- -Hey. -I'm sorry. That was really inappropriate. -Yeah, I, I know what Cosmo's told you guys. It's totally fine. I mean, you know everything. Right? -What do you mean? -I thought maybe you were going to say something-- -No. -Hair. I do hair. -Hair? -Yeah, you know, you asked what I did, and sometimes I do hair, kind of here and there. Hair? I know there's not that much to say about it. -No, I'm sorry, something just isn't happening with this sauce. -Where do you keep your napkins? -We just, um, fold up paper towels. -Oh, cool. We do that, too. Hey, what do you think of my hair? -What? Oh, it's very-- -Yeah. I don't know. It's-- when you're a professional, it's kind of hard to get perspective. You know, I mean, you must understand that stuff. -So you used to be a dancer? That's, um, that's great. You know, when I was a little girl, I, I always wanted to be a dancer. But I guess, well, all little girls wanted to be dancers. Do you do most of the cooking? Hello? Hello? -Jack, aren't we gonna talk? I'm concerned about the time. -Don't worry. Be as long as you like. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Jack! -Oh, I'm worried about Rita. -Don't worry about Rita. It's not gonna help you. Or her. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Jack! Jack! -See, i come here to, um, to be myself. To feel myself. To find my authenticity. -Do I have to hold your hand? -No. Oh, thank you. Thank you. So what's going on, Cosmo? -Well, I'm-- I'm feeling afraid. -Afraid of what? -Well, of women. Are they all crazy? -Well, that's their nature. That's what makes them so wonderful. -What do you mean? -Well, you know, women, it's what it's all about. I mean, what else is there? -Wow. That's really-- it's really-- But what about, I mean,-- -Well, men, and we've talked about men. I mean, it's our nature to want to be near that crazy thing. And to want to be with as many women as we can. -Right. Right. Jack, I feel I'm facing an opportunity, and I don't want that opportunity to be cut off. -Cut off? -Well, I mean, the way I was raised and everything, I always felt that all my-- -Your opportunities? -They were always being cut off. And I don't want that to happen this time. -Right. I've heard it's very painful to have your opportunities cut off. -Do mean that-- -It's not funny, Cosmo. It's-- I mean, it's sad to have all the opportunities in your life not come to anything, and have yet another one facing you, and not-- -Jack, i don't know what I'm going to do. -Right. See, I think you do. [chanting] [phone ringing] RITA (OFFSCREEN): Arlie? Arlie? -I'm up here! RECORDING: The doctors are not in. Please, leave a message. -It's amazing up here. RECORDING: If you are in crisis. you can call Dr. Jacobi-- -Oh. Um, you don't mind? -No, no, no. Not at all. [recording continues] -I, um, I love your outfit. -Oh, yeah, yeah, it looks good with the fuck me pumps. -The what? -Oh. Has Cosmo seen this? -I'm not sure. We usually keep to the living room. -Uh-huh. Oh. It's the men. So? You two have a nice talk? -Arlie, you've made your point. Now can we go? -Well, Rita and I had a very nice talk. All about you. -Arlie, we have to leave here now. Look, don't do this to me. I mean it. Arlie. -Christ, you're twice as wound up as when you went outside. What happened? -Look, there's certain things-- -Hey. -Hi. -So you two had dinner? -Yes. -No. -Well, technically speaking, we didn't have dinner, but we had a very late lunch. -Maybe I should interrogate the suspects separately. -Jack, we didn't come over here to bust in on your dinner. -Then why did you come over here? -Arlie! -Well, he's funny. -Christ, you go on and on about how fucking funny he is, and then he's funny, and you yell at me. -So you'll stay for dinner? -We'd love to stay. -Great, that's settled. -Can we do anything? -Um, well, sure. There's a salad here you could take care of. And, would you mind setting the table? -No. -Thanks. This is gonna be great. -Jack-- -Isn't this fun? -So, uh, are you happy now? -What's that supposed to mean? -Hey, how many of those beers have you had? -Oh, daddy doesn't like Arlie to get drunk? -Just don't start up. -Start up? What's that supposed to mean? -If you fuck this up for me-- -Hey, don't you talk to me like that. You can't talk to me like that. Is this what you learn over here? Just how to treat your wife disrespect? COSMO (OFFSCREEN): I'm going. I'll be out in the car. -Hey. -Hi. -How you doing? -I'm tired. -Yeah, yeah. -Have they, uh-- -Um-- listen, they, they invited themselves to dinner. -What? -No, I feel like they're asking for our help. -Jack-- -And Cosmo's in such a fragile state. -Jack, Jack, he's our client. That's completely unprofessional. I don't even know how you can, like, entertain the idea. -Rita, I guess I don't see things quite as black and white as you. -This is very clear. -Well, I mean, they're people. We're people. We asked him to get him something going with his life, and now that it's going, we can't just let it go. -This is gonna turn into another cosmic free for all? -Well, free for all, not exactly. I just thought this was an opportunity to help him. I thought, I mean, we can do this together. -Really? Why? ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): Put your wife in her place. Leave her, just drive off. Go ahad. -Sure. No. Right. Um, why don't you just go to sleep, and I'll sneak in in a little while? -Jack, is something wrong? -Oh, no. Things are great. COSMO (OFFSCREEN): Don't try talking like you do. ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): What are you gonna do, little king? COSMO (OFFSCREEN): You love this, don't you? Seeing me like this. You don't care about meeting Jack, Rita. You're just trying to screw this up for me. -You think you're such a little king. -I mean, what is so awful about-- -Do you ever listen to yourself talk? You're one of those people who it would help if you were videotaped, like on those shows, and then made to watch it. You're one of those people. -How's everything coming? -Great. Just about finished. -Wow. Really? -Anything else we could do? -Um, I guess you could let Rita know we're ready. I don't think she'll join us, but-- -Sure. -Thanks. -Shit. [music playing] [knocking] -Oh, hi. -Jack sent me up. We're ready to eat. -Tell him I'll be down in a minute. -Sure thing. Take your time. COSMO (OFFSCREEN): Jack? [chanting] -Jack? Jack, I, I-- -Boo. -Jack, I, I still feel uncomfortable about coming-- -Cosmo, Cosmo, Cosmo. What is it? -I'm sorry. I-- I'm sorry. Is there something else that I should do? -You know, why don't you spin the chairs around so we can eat, OK? Thanks. -She'll be right down. -Arlie? Why don't you sit right there? -Sure. -And Cosmo, take that chair. Excuse me. Thank you. So let's eat. -Well, aren't we going to wait for Rita? -Oh, I don't think she'll be down. And she wasn't feeling up to it before, so-- thanks. -Well, Arlie just said she was coming. She did make the meal. [laughter] -Oh. Rita. Well. We're gonna eat quickly, and be out of here in half an hour at the most. -I'm sorry. -Rita? -Why don't we join hands? As-- as I see into our hearts, the ocean of life. (SINGING) Shanti. Shanti. -Shanti. Peace, peace, peace. -Over the teeth and over the gums. Look out, stomach, here it comes. What was that? -Why don't you serve yourselves? -You know, Arlie made the salad. -Cosmo. -Mm. -Thank you. -What is this? -Bulgur. You didn't take any bulgur. -Well, that certainly looks great. -Cos, can I get you something else? -Why don't you just take your bulgur, darling? -Well, you know, Arlie, we ate so late that I just-- -I'm sure you know my husband won't eat anything I don't cook. Oh, yeah. See? I'm his little mommy. Right, honey? I feed my little baby? -That's a complete exaggeration. -Exaggeration? Once I got this great casserole at a swap meat, and when I served it, Cosmo tasted it and said, you didn't make this, did you? So I tried to lie for a while, and when he finally-- -Andele, andele. -Forced it out of me that it wasn't mine, he wouldn't eat it. Just refused. Said he wanted his mommy to make him dinner. You're so cute. -Oh, well, that really is great. -Thank you. -Well, it was-- -I don't know. Sometimes you have to live with someone to really get to know them. Sometimes not. -So-- -Wine, anyone? -Well, I started with a beer, but I-- -Well, I mean, aren't we going to be leaving soon? -What do you think, Arlie? -It's a school night. Why not? -All right. Why not? -Sorry. -No, it's fine. It's fine. -What are you apologizing for? -Well, we said we were going to stay for half an hour, and now we're drinking wine. -Can't we just have a good time for once? JACK (OFFSCREEN): Somebody say good time? -Oh, goodie. -Could you hold that for me? -Sure. -There you go. -Thank you. -I like this house, Mo Mo. -Mo Mo? -Oh, that's just a little jokey name. -No, it's my favorite name for Mo Mo. [music playing] -Is that too loud? -I, I really can't listen to this, hon. I'm sorry. -See, that's a little game they play, and he's asked if it's too loud, and then she says yes. -Did I miss anything? [music stops] -We were talking about Cosmo's nickname. -Oh, come on. -Nickname? -Yeah. Mo Mo. -Mo Mo. -I think we've given Cos a hard enough time for now. -Naw. Let's really give it some more. -Oh, Arlie. -Just kidding you, Mo Mo. -That's what he always says when he's being cruel. -So Arlie, do you like to cook? -Well, I didn't used to love it, but every-- -You know, Arlie's actually quite domestic. But her domestic sense is a little bit misshapen. It's sort of like a hardy fruit after a rugged winter. -What the fuck does that mean? -Just a joke. -Oh, I'm just busting a guy over here. -So, so you were out doing some shopping today? -Yeah. -I was out looking for outfits. How do you like it? -Well, it's-- -It's very cute. -Really? thank you. Yeah, Coco likes to be with me when I shop for my outfits. -Coco? I thought it was Mo Mo. -I call him that when he's a bad boy. Sometimes I sneak Coco into the dressing room with me, you know, because they-- -Bad boy, eh, Coco? I'm sorry. Go on. -Well, I caught him once, trying to peek into the next stall-- -Arlie. Aren't we gonna be leaving soon? -So you were out doing some shopping today? -Yeah. -Boy, did we see some real types today. -Really? At the mall. -Christ. Sometimes I wonder how people have the nerve to go outside. -Arlie, that's terrible. -Oh, admit it. Most people have such pathetic little lives. -Oh, I dunno. Cosmo does pretty well for himself. -No, no, no, that was mean! -It was a joke. Come on. -So, we were at the supermarket-- -Are you OK? -He's fine. -Yeah, I understand Jack's sense of humor now. It took me a little while to get used to it, but-- -Hey. I was talking here, you know? -Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry. -Thank you. So we're waiting in line, and there's this smelly, weird, bend up guy who's buying lottery tickets. Like, like he's holding up the whole line while he tries to figure out his lucky number. Like, like, people are starving, and their kids are getting nuts. And this schmendrick is asking this stacked 15-year-old girl, and you should have seen Coco staring at her tits. -Was not. -It's no big deal. You always do it. -She's completely making that up. -Bad boy, eh, Coco? -Oh, god. Everybody does it. I mean, doesn't everyone? -What number did he pick? -Excuse me? -The uh, smelly, bent up guy? -Oh, yeah. Um, I don't know. Oh, Christ, what a scene. Did you ever notice how everybody on that side of town is fat? Or limps? Or is cross eyed? -Arlie, don't be stupid. -Stupid? Talk about stupid? No. What they are thinking about, that's what's stupid. Unbelievable. -Arlie, I'm not sure if everybody's-- -Did you ever wonder what's behind those pinched up little mugs? Those swollen, about to explode faces that come sprouting out of those fat, pimply necks? Ugh. I mean, you should have seen this kid they had. This kid was so angry, he had little pointy teeth, like a vampire. He was like a channeler for their unhappiness. Yeah, a, a, a conduit for their anger. A, a, a hostile little weed choking off my air. -Must have felt sad for the child. -I wanted to slap this sad little fuck. -How lyric. -What? -How lyric. How beautiful apt your description was. -Yeah. I mean, that kid is gonna be raping you in an alley 10 years from now. You know it's true. I mean, that's where creeps like that come from. I mean, what do these people think they're doing? It just makes me nuts. And then they always want to get on to the six item or less line, when they have about 50 things? Like, like, where are they going that they're in such a rush? To go home and stuff their faces, and limp around the house? Oh, and the, the shit they eat. I mean, you can see why sleep with their kids, and shoot each other at these things they call picnics. I mean, sometimes it makes you think Hitler wasn't so misguided. -Arlie, I don't think you know what that sounds like. -Oh, come on. Most of them aren't even Americans. -She doesn't even mean this. -No. It is true, it's so true. I mean, do you ever listen to them talk? It's unbelievable. I mean, talk about aliens from outer space. Christ. -Oh, Christ, and the kids. Like, deformed little greasy clones. And they look at you like you're some kind of freak. It's amazing. Why do they have kids? -Maybe so they have more ugly people around the house. They don't feel so bad about themselves. -Exactly. You know, it makes you wonder whether they should allow some people to reproduce. Like, like, they should have some board of people to give out licenses. The whole thing is sick. This is really good. Eh, Cosmo? Oh, Christ. Ah. That's what I think. JACK (OFFSCREEN): Don't forget your opportunities, Cosmo. -I really don't think-- -Let it go, Rita. Just let it go. What are you feeling? -Thank you. -Don't mention it. -Well, you know, I, I think that deep down, that-- -That's the only way to think about anything, really. Deep down's good. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Jack. -What is it, lover? -Lover? What did you mean by that? I'm asking you what you meant by that. -Why? -Because you hurt my feelings. -Oh, I'm sorry. Go on. I'm just kidding, honey. -Well, I, um, I'd really rather not. Thank you. -Well, Rita, um, I would love to hear what you were going to say. I mean, Jack was just joking. This-- -It's her house. If she doesn't want to talk, she doesn't have to. -Well, I, I think that deep down, that the characters at the mall were an expression of the eternal conflict between the upper and the lower chakras. Now, I-- I don't presume any great wisdom, although as you do know that I follow-- -There's no conflict between chakras. -Well, sometimes-- -There's no conflict. They're all of one. There's no hierarchy. RITA (OFFSCREEN): I wasn't positing hierarchy. -Well, not overtly, Rita, but we, uh, we all know your agenda. COSMO (OFFSCREEN): Now, Jack, uh, I think that might be a little unfair. -What do you mean, unfair? -They all seem the same to me. -Wait a minute. I want to know what he's talking about. -Well, I just think that some people feel that, you know, the chakras are, uh, are not so sharply defined. -You're telling me about chakras? It's OK, Cosmo. Sorry, what were you saying? -Thank you. So, I mean, seriously, look at people. Some are more valuable than others. I mean, certainly-- -See, I think every human being is of equal value, no matter where they've come from, or how they've been brought up in their souls. -Most people don't have souls. -Well, I beg to differ. I think people can overcome their background, and their past. -Right. Rich people. -People can recover. They can heal. They can evolve past-- -Serious? Some of those people are less evolved than Chico. -Chico? -Chico is Arlie's dog. -Chico is not a dog. I've told you. -I'm not permitted to use the word dog when I'm speaking of Chico. -What is Chico, then? Sorry. -Chico is Chico. -To Chico. -Yeah. She, uh, cares more about the dog than she cares about me. -Coco hates his little brother Chico. -He is not my little brother. -Chico. That'd be a boy. -Of course. -I, uh, I see a lot of sad cases at St. Jerome's. ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): St. Jerome's? -The clinic in town? ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): That must be a scene. You know, when they turn on each other? Those kinds of people to that kind of thing every night. You see it on those TV shows. Hey, do you have anymore of this? -Yeah, there's another one in on the counter by the coffee maker. -The whole situation in the city is just infuriating. Oh, and those homeless people. Don't get me started. Talk about evolved. -I'm sorry. RITA (OFFSCREEN): No, no, no. It's fine. JACK (OFFSCREEN): No, no. Go on, Cosmo. What are you feeling? -Well, I mean, it-- -I'm gonna go take a pee. Be right back. -So, do you understand now? -I'm not the one who needs to understand, Cosmo. -Well. Now you've seen her. Was I exaggerating? See, you always thought I was exaggerating. That there was some other side to the story. Well, I guess there's only one side to this story. -No, no, no. Cos, these things are really complicated. And-- what? What? [music playing] COSMO (OFFSCREEN): Rita? She's not normal. You can't tell me she's normal. I mean, I feel I fall under the normal range. I mean, maybe toward one end or the other, but I think she's mentally ill. She's just plain sick. I mean, don't you agree with me? RITA (OFFSCREEN): Cos, it's really getting late, and I-- look, we all have to go to work tomorrow. And-- -Oh, no. She doesn't have to go to work. Because she doesn't work. So she doesn't have to go to work tomorrow. -I don't know. Maybe I can give you the name of, um-- I don't-- maybe somebody down at the clinic might-- -Clinic? She wouldn't talk to anybody. I mean, she doesn't even have friends. Do you know what that means? To not even have friends. I mean, she wouldn't talk to anybody. I mean, you've seen her. So tell me you don't see what she's like now. -Cosmo, you're giving her a lot of power. I mean, can't you just say what you're feeling? Just take a breath, and just say what you're feeling. -There's this couple who live across the courtyard from us, you know? They never turn their lights on at night. The only time you can see them is when they open the refrigerator. It's amazing. It's been fascinating. I mean, did-- -No. They're just fat. -Just take a breath and talk about your feelings. -Jack. -What are you feeling? -See, I-- I remember when I was, um, seven or eight years old. Uh, I was a very protective child. See, my mother was not the kind of-- Well, I mean, I don't even-- It's funny, I-- When you look back, I guess you think you invented all these things. Somebody probably showed me this, or I saw somebody doing it, or I don't know how it's possible that I can't even remember-- ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): Oh, christ, we get it. You're really interesting. Get to the freaking point, would you? -Yes dear. Don't you just love her? ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): They could give a shit. It's just a dinner party, man. We leave, they talk about us, dissect our lives. We get in the car and trash them. That's how it's done, right? OK, OK. Just tell the fucking story, OK? Mhmm. -All right, forget it. -No, no. Go on. -Just let it go, honey. What are you feeling? -See, uh, I-- I realized that you could take a pee outdoors, and it was like the whole world had opened up to me. I went outside every chance I got. I felt like Marco Polo or Einstein. I understood the world. ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): Wow. -It's like-- ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): How fascinating. -Look. I want to talk about how I feel. ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): Christ. -See, then, uh-- then my parents put in this, um, outdoor shower so that we could, uh, wash off the sand when we came home from the beach. And, uh, it was right outside the back door and I remember I used to go out there at night and take showers in the dark. You know, late at night in the summer in the dark, stars and everything without my clothes on. And then I would, uh, walk around in the backyard without my clothes on. I just felt like Alexander the Great or something. I-- ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): Bet you were touching yourself all over, weren't you? -Wh-- Why are you doing this? -I'm just being a good little wifey. -Well, go on. Tell everyone how you touched yourself. I mean, who did that make you feel like? Um, Bela fucking Lugosi, or some other good inventor or conqueror? -I think it's great, Cos. -Oh, me too. Really. -Well, you-- I mean, you must have had something like this happen to you. -What do you mean? -Some seminal event. Something that-- that helped form you. -Is this how you people sit around over here? Talking about seminal events? Oh man, this is really out. -Yeah, it's called, uh, sharing. Some people do it. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -You don't believe in sharing, Arlie? -Well, I, I guess it seems cool if you're trying to really say something. -Yes? -I mean, nobody really wants to ever hear anything. I mean, you come here. Who knows why people do this kind of thing? This-- this dinner party shit. But it's hardly to find anything out. -What do you mean? -Well, I mean, poor Cosmo out here. He's such a sad fuck he has to pay to have people listen to him. He has to pay to have friends like your little group. RITA (OFFSCREEN): You sound very, very angry, Arlie. -Hey, relax, doc. I'm just talking here. -Arlie, relationships are really complicated. And-- and, um, when, um-- when Jack and I feel connected-- well-- well, I mean, when we're feeling-- when we feel connected, so it helps us to-- -Yeah, right. Like you're going to help us. Is that what this is all about? -Well, we were thinking-- I was thinking that you wanted to talk things out. I think that Cos would like to-- -I think we should all become friends. -To-- -I mean, I haven't talked this over with you, Rita, but I'm sitting here and I'm thinking, we should spend the holidays together, just the four of us. You know, skip the family for once. Spend time with people we really care about. -Are we really the best you could do? That's so sad. We hardly know you and tonight we're all friends. Where did everybody go? What happened? I mean, this-- this-- This is not how they told me it would be. I mean, life is not supposed to be this way, you know? Something's gone really wrong here, and I'm not going to-- -I think I have-- -(YELLING) What? -I need to talk about how I feel. -Cosmo, wh-- why are you talking like this? -Something's happened to me. -You don't talk like this. This is not you. -I think you're right. -What does that mean? -(QUIETLY) Is he, um, saying something that you find hurtful? -What? -(LOUDER) Is he saying something that-- that's painful? -What the fuck are you talking about? -Arlie? -Well, where does she get off? I mean, she's been pushing me and pushing me, doing this thing to you. -I think she's just trying to help us. -Well, who says we need help? -I'm sorry if I intruded, I was only-- -Yeah, you did, so butt out. -I am saying I'm sorry! COSMO (OFFSCREEN): I just can't do this anymore. I just can't. -I'm sorry, what? -I just-- I-- It's too difficult. -No, no, no. Just take a breath. I just can't. I just-- -What are you two talking about? COSMO (OFFSCREEN): I honestly just-- -You little weasel. -What? -You heard me, you're a little sneak. -Oh, help me anybody. -You are such a worm. -Can we all just calm down? ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): You fucking people, setting me up. -How's that? -You pump poor old Cosmo here for his life story so he can feel superior. I mean, who knows what he hasn't told you about us. And then you sit around and play with us. I mean, I can tell you he's told you all kinds of shit about us, and I think it stinks. -See, this is exactly why I never wanted you to meet Jack and Rita. I mean, do you know that she was so upset that I had something in my life apart from her that she wanted me to get her into our group? -Oh! -Can you believe that? Can you imagine her in the group? -Hey, I didn't have any-- -It wouldn't work! You wouldn't get it. You just-- -You-- -We just don't speak the same language. I'm sorry, but we don't. That's our problem. Your life is over there, my life is over here, and we just don't. It doesn't-- it isn't happening anymore. Sometimes I wonder if it ever was. -Arlie's a dancer. Did you know that she-- she's a dancer. -Really? Wow. -Yeah. -Oh, god. -What? -I just feel-- -What are you feeling? -I feel, I feel-- -Stay with the feeling. Stay with-- -Cosmo, you're an asshole. -Oh, and she doesn't even mean that. I just, I feel guilty that I told you so much about-- -What did you tell them? -Just the high points. -What? -Oh. Nothing. I'm sorry. Go on. -Go. Just, I feel bloated. -Bloated? What do you mean? -You hardly ate anything. -You ever, you know when you're hungry, and you know the feeling of eating? When you're not hungry, you just that disgusted feeling? Why can't I do what I want? -Oh, Christ. -Sometimes I feel I can't take anymore in. It's like it's killing me in some way. There's something in me telling me just to stop! RITA (OFFSCREEN): It really has gotten late, and I think we're all tired. -No, I think Cosmo has something to tell us, don't you, Cosmo? -Oh, Arlie-- -You know, I heard what you were all saying about me when I went upstairs, Cosmo. -Arlie, I-- this, this is really hard. -Oh. Really? -I want to do what I want. Why can't I do what I want? -Oh, Christ. -What do you want, Cosmo? -I am so afraid. -Is therapy what we're doing now? -I really think that this has gone far enough. -No, I think Cosmo needs to talk about this. -I just can't do this anymore. I just can't go on. -What does he mean, he can't go on? -I mean, how do you go on? I don't know anyone does it. I mean, they're everywhere! -What do you mean? -All the girls out there on the street. I mean, you've seen them! It's insane! -What the hell do you mean, girls? -I just don't think I can go on anymore! ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): Take what? -It, it, um-- -Go to bed, honey. -No, Rita, please, don't go. Just for a minute! Please! -What? -I'm just trying to say this is too much for me. There is nothing in this for me anymore. -Well, what is this? I mean, what the fuck does this mean? -Oh, Arlie. -Do you have anything else to drink? -I think we finished our last bottle. -No, I think I could dig something up. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Jack! -Free for all, anyone? How's scotch? -Great. RITA (OFFSCREEN): Why are you doing this? -It's called living, honey. ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): So, Cosmo, everybody wants to hear what you have to say. All your friends. -I need to be my own person. I need to be-- -Let tell you about Cosmo. Do you know how I met Cosmo? -Arlie, that's not important. -Oh, I think it is. -Well, I don't think anybody wants to hear about that. -Oh. You mean you didn't tell them about this? You told tell them everything else about us, but not this? -Oh, please! -I don't know if you could tell, but I'm not like the rest of you. No, I didn't go to college. I was kind of a hippie. I mean, the, the hippie thing was dead, but I, I lived in this commune-- -This is really happening. -Kind of thing, and we got high a lot, and partied all the time, and I worked in this bar. Dancing. -Look, I want to talk about now. -Does anybody want to hear this? -I, I'd love to hear this. -Fine. I'm going to bed. Would you lock up? ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): Can I use your stereo? JACK (OFFSCREEN): Oh, sure. It's your house now. -This is not going well. -Oh, it's going where it's going. [music playing] -I worked in this bar. Cosmo would come into this place. All the time. He was this nondescript kind of guy. He hasn't changed. But he would sit and watch. See, I would dance. Oh, he was in grad school. Like I could care. I was a dancer. And Cosmo had this problem, see? Cosmo couldn't do it. I was the only one he could do it with, and now he hates me for it. Right, wormy? See? I fixed Cosmo! I fixed Cosmo! -All right, stop it! Stop it! That's enough! Look-- I need to be myself! I need to be-- -What are you saying? -It's a question of-- of independence! -Please, just say it! [music stops] -I need to be alone. I want to be alone. Without you. -We-- we were OK until you started coming over here. We were fine. You were happy. -No! I was not! I'm not! I'm not happy! -OK. Fine. You're a nobody. You know? I knew that when I met you. But as time has gone by, you've climbed up my body. You stood on my back, and you were able to see into the world of people who were somebody, and that started to make you feel like you were a regular guy. You had the right to have regular feelings. But you see? You don't. You hear me? You don't! You think you can just walk away from me, but you see you can't. You're just going to fall back down. It's not fair. I held you up all these years, and then you do this? I mean, I could have walked away anytime, and you would have fallen. And you'd still be falling. But I didn't. I wouldn't do that to you. Without me here, you're gonna keep falling. Forever. And you know it. -I'd-- ARLIE (OFFSCREEN): What? I gotta get out of here. -I hope it wasn't something I said. -God. I feel alive. -What are you doing? -Oh, I heard it's good to get a breath of fresh air after a, . Big meal. I was gonna take a-- -Why are you going out there? -What do you suggest, doctor? -It's not our problem. -It's not our problem? What do you think of that, Cosmo? It's not our problem. -I just feel very tired. -He feels very tried. -Jack, it's really getting late. -Yeah, right. Arlie? -You think I did the right thing? -I don't know. -Well, I think I did. So easy to forget. That's what counts. I've never done this before. I've never left someone. -Arlie? It's Jack! -You know, when I first started coming over here to see you and Jack, this thing started happening. I just-- I started looking at girls. And it was all the time. I mean, I look over at Arlie, and I just sink like a little boat. You know, sometimes I get up in the middle of the night, I look over at her sleeping next to me. And I just go downstairs into the living room, and I lie on the floor. Listen to music from long ago. And then I just, I just float away. To the place I should have gone. Because I never did what I wanted to do. This is my last chance. She wants to have a kid now. If that happens, I'll be lost forever. I'll be stuck forever. There will be two of them following me around the house all day long. I mean, she's great for herself. She's just not great for me. I mean, there's something in me that's been asleep for so long. I mean, sometimes I get these great feelings of expansion, and limitlessness. And then she just puts a pin in me. It's like how you feel at a party. You've had a few drinks, and you've danced for the first time in months, and some woman you've never seen before smiles at you, and you really feel yourself at that moment. You really feel yourself. And you need to use the toilet, so you get in some strange bathroom. You turn around, there's a full length mirror on the wall, you see yourself, and you say, yuck! That's me! That's not me. -You know, I was reading this book. And the book was saying that you have to follow your own heart, and you have to listen to your heart. And so I decided I would do that. And I really sat there and listened, and the crazy thing was, I didn't hear anything. And I realized, you have to be listening all the time. It's like a kid. You can't be a parent part of the time. A kid needs you all the time, or else it just shrivels up, and it's that attitude that counts. It's that feeling that your heart is where it all starts. I mean, you can't be doing all this other shit. These things for everybody else, and getting old and sick inside? And then you decide when you read a book, to then decide to listen to your heart? I mean, that's ludicrous. I mean, everybody's out there killing and robbing, and looting, and screwing around, and doing everything they want? And I have to sit here and live with my mistake? I mean, I was-- I was watching the tube the other night, just thinking, and she called out to me. And it was unbelievable what I said, before I even knew what I was saying. She called out to me and I said, what, Mom? Mom. It was so scary. It was frightening, like-- like there was something in me that I didn't even know was there that was coming out, like some futuristic science fiction thing where I'd been taken over, or something had been planted in me, and now the aliens were returning to harvest their crop. It was so creepy. I find myself looking at women. A lot. -Arlie? Where are you? -I've-- I've never talked like that in my life. Was I embarrassing you? Would-- Would you like to join me? -No, no, no, I'm fine, thank you. -I know you have to get an early start tomorrow. Maybe you'll just like to go to bed. Well, I don't know why I said that. I'm just not used to feeling this way. I-- I feel so alive, and I-- the colors are so vivid and everything. It's-- it's-- it's just amazing. Say, now, look, I know it's really late, but, um-- -What? What? -What would you think if I put on a little music? I mean, something very, very quiet. -Anything that you would like. -Well. I would like, um-- [music playing] -You know, I've never been with anyone else. I'm talking about Arlie, of course. Have you been with many men? [laughing] -I don't know what's happening to me. I-- I never talk like this, as you know. -You know what? It's, um-- it's very, very, very sweet. -Really? -What? Do women like that? You know, I, um-- I met somebody once who said to me that you can only love a certain number of people in your life. I think he said five. And after that, it doesn't mean anything anymore. And you know, I found that idea very, very scary. -Why are you-- you telling me this? -Because you mean a lot to me. I mean, you and Jack. -We're very fond of you. [clearing throat] -Well, maybe I shouldn't be talking like this. Maybe I shouldn't even be drinking like this. You know that I've been, uh, looking at women a lot. -What do you mean? -Use your imagination You know, I-- I didn't mean what I said just now about looking at women. Boy, you must really wonder. -Don't you wonder what they're doing out there? -Hm? -Arlie seems so, um, free. -Christ, are you kidding? -No. No. COSMO (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, I think, uh, now that we've broken up, Arlie will find some other guy right away. By the way, what did you think about Arlie? I mean, what did you think about what she said before she busted out of here? You know, about how I would be falling without her. RITA (OFFSCREEN): I don't know. -She's right. -See, I come here to, uh-- to be myself, to feel myself, to find my authenticity. I'm-- I'm sorry about tonight and everything. -Shit. Oh god, forget it. -Can I-- Can I kiss you? I'm not kidding. -I didn't think you were. -What are you, uh? -Sometimes when I come home, and it's late, and the sun's gone down, I stand in the dark house, looking in the window thinking, I'm in here alone in the dark, and nobody knows. Nobody knows that I'm in here. -Well, what about Jack? RITA (OFFSCREEN): Jack isn't, um-- Jack isn't who you-- uh, who you think he is. Did you-- Did you know that? -No. -Every time-- Every time that you leave, he, uh, he regales me with your idiocy. -Rita! Oh. -Get the fuck off me! Go home! Now! [music playing] -Last year, I-- I-- I got-- I got pregnant. It was great, you know? I mean, perfect how the whole thing happened. I mean, we had never really talked about it, me and Cosmo. And-- and when we did, it went great. I mean, you know, we had fun. And it happened right away. And we were even arguing about what to call-- It's funny. We used to call the baby it. Like, like what are we going to call it? We used to laugh about that. And then I lost it. And when I lost it, I lost it. Something went wrong. It-- I guess they never know what really-- I mean, they say they don't know, but I think there's all kinds of things that doctors know that they never tell you. I mean, even hip ones. Even guys like you. I mean, we never got to call it anything. A he, or a she, or anything. I suppose I should be used to it by now, but I'm not. And sometimes it just gets worse. Like-- I guess the hardest thing now is never calling the baby anything but it. The thing is, now, he won't come near me. It did something to him. He won't talk about it. I mean, almost never. And he, he gets real funny if it ever comes up. Funny thing, too, is you know, I got really nuts for a while after it happened. Like, screaming and carrying on about everything. And he never made a peep. But it made him funny in the end. I don't know what to do about him. -Yeah. -Enough about me. -Arlie, are you getting cold? -No. I'm good. I can see why Cosmo likes you so much. Hm. What the fuck are you doing? -I, I-- I thought, um-- -I can't kiss you. -But before, you-- -That, that was before I told you all the stuff. I mean, I could never kiss you after I told you all that. I mean, like that, you know? -Yeah. No, sure. Sure. -You screw around, don't you? -Well, I don't know if I'd call it-- -It's OK. I won't tell anyone. -No, it's, um, it's difficult to explain. It's complicated when you-- -Yeah. I'm sure. -Well, I like you a lot. -Yeah. It's the dancing. I'm still pretty cute, aren't I? Oh, god, I'm sorry. I'm a little wound up. I was a hippie for a while, you know? -Right. You mentioned that. -You wanna go back? -Yeah. -Do we have to? -Yeah. Come on. -Hey. Who takes all the methaqualone? -Um, how do you know? Where did you see that? -There's quaaludes hidden all over your house. -How do you know they're quaaludes, and-- -That's what guests do. They go through your bathroom. Everybody does it. -And, and you found methaqualone? -Yeah. How long's she been on that? -I, uh-- -You OK? -Yeah. -My sphere of consciousness expands. I want to be authentic. Like Trevor Howard. Wasn't he great? It's all about us. It's not ourselves. And what's out there. You know? The ultimate. -Honey? Honey? You're OK. Hey, baby. You're OK. -Oh, god. -Here you go. Here you go. -I want the world to go away. -Right. We'll make the world go away. OK. [inaudible]. -Hi. -Yeah? What is it, baby? -I'm hungry. -You want me to make you something? -I'm sorry about everything. -Shut up. Where are they? -Rita, for god's sake. I think she drank too much. -Yeah. -What, what are you-- you can do that later. -What about them? -Well, uh, we'll call them in the morning. -Well, I don't want them to think I had a bad time. Quit pulling on me! -Well, Christ, I, I'm hungry. You said you'd make me something. -Don't whine. -But you said-- -What do you want? Get in the car. Are you crazy? Where am I gonna find-- -Where are you going? -I was just gonna go downstairs to clean up a little. -Don't go. Are you gonna leave me? -No. -Why? Not? -There's nothing out there. -You don't mean that, do you? -No, I was just kidding. -Who would you-- Who would you run away with? -Rita. -Hm? -Shut up and go to sleep. -You're not gonna leave? -I promise. -Good. Will you sing to me? -Christ. -Please. The little rabbit song? -(SINGING) Look at me, sad, pink eyes, floppy ears, fluff disguise. But in my heart, I'm a lion. This will change if I keep trying. Please, let me love you. Just let me try. My life will be happy. I'll smile when I die. Please let me love you. Just let me try. My life will be happy. (WHISPERING) I'll smile when I die.
