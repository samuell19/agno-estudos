- What's up, baby boy? What's up, mama? Whoa! What are you doing? - Washing my hands. - His mama got locked up. - What? For what? - An old warrant or some bullshit. I don't know, but you need to go bail her. - Why can't she just thug it out? - Because I got work. I can't watch him. - Well, who said you have to watch him? - Well, I know you ain't gonna watch him, so... - How much is it? 400. - Ah, shit. What the fuck? How the fuck am I gonna get that? - I don't fucking know where you're gonna get $400. Ask her aunties. - Mom, her aunties don't even like me. I ain't got time for this. - You don't have time for what shit? Your baby mama? Or me? - Oh, you got a collar, huh? Yo. I have your dog. Yeah, where you live at? Like the first one or the second one? Alright. Well, I'll be by in like a couple minutes or something. Alright. Yo, you guys wanna buy a PS4? No. - Come on. Come on. Here you go. Come on. - What kind of dog is it? - I don't even know. She was just outside of my house. She's pretty cool, huh? - Mm-hmm. - You wanna buy her? - No. Come on. - Hey, you good? - Man, nah, I'm fucking confused, bro. - Fuck, bro, it's hot outside. - Hotter than Germ's math teacher. Oh, score. - Yeah. He's flexing the burrito. - It's a bologna sandwich. Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks for this couch. - I know he got some blaze. - Hey, Donny, don't look at these. - Holy cow. Holy fuck, these are pretty nice, bro. - Hey, don't fuck with that. My dad will fuck you up, man. - Alright, after I look I'll return it. - Geez! - What? - Holy shit! What is this? I knew he had something. What is this? - Let me see. Let me check it out. - Fuck you. - Yo, we can smoke that. Bro, let's smoke it then. - Fuck that. - Why? - My dad will fuck me up. - Bruh. - Shit's bunk. - Did you experience it? - Bro... It's meth. - Meth is the best. - I'm about it, walking around like that. - Like you tried it. - Like you ever tried it? - Well, I did. - Oh. My. Gosh. But I did. - Geez. - And it tastes like shit. Bro, it burns the back of your throat so much it makes you skinny. It makes you throw up all your food. You stay up for like, 14 days. Bro, one single fucking hit. - One hit, you're addicted. - Fucker. - Boy, you're like, 10. You can't have tried it back then. - Chicken wing, no way. - Let me see then. You being a bitch, bro. Just let me see. - Bro, you're gonna end up bony as fuck. Let's sell it. - Yo, who is it? - I was talking to somebody about returning a dog. - Oh, yeah. She's mine. Let me see. Come on. So, what's good? - Not much. You got a return fee? - For what? - Well, we were just thinking, since we brought it back, you could hook it up with a little something. - Can't be giving out hand-outs, bro. That's bad for business. But if you want to buy her, I could cut you in because you found her. She's expensive though. - Fuck. How much is she? - A rack. Sometimes two. Just depends. - Fuck, a rack for that? - Fuck yeah. Shit. If you breed her, the puppies go for like, a rack or two each. - Holy fuck, man. - Yo, so I'm gonna make some tea. Do you guys want any? - No, I'm good. - No, we're straight. But I just think it's fucked up that we did a good deed when we didn't have to, and we can't get no deal or nothing. We could've just ran off with it. - Could cut you a deal for 990 for your little good deed or whatever. - What the fuck? 990? Ain't that some cheap-skating ass shit? You're only taking 10 bucks off of that. You fucking serious? - I mean, you're the one fucking coming at me with a deal. I'm giving you one, bro. - First of all, we ain't come and ask for a deal. We're coming because we're bringing your dog back. And second of all, when do I need the money by? Shit. Could be tonight. Could be tomorrow. ASAP. - Hurry up, you fucking... - His donkey looks retarded. - We got some meth, bro. You want some? - Shut the fuck up. - That donkey's straight up dementia or something. Fuck. - Yo, why are you calling me out like that? - 'Cuz, bro, we got some shit and we need to get rid of it. - How much? - How much do you want? - Probably just a dub right now. - 100 bucks, bro. - 100 bucks for a fucking dub, man? What the fuck, man? That shit's outrageous, bro. - All right. 60 bucks. - 60 bucks is still too much, man. What the fuck? You think I'm a bank or something? I'll give you $20 for two dubs, man. That's a deal. - Okay wait, hold up. You got any hoots? - Shit, yeah. I got a couple. - Well, I'll tell you this. We'll take 40 and the hoots. - Shit, all I got is 20 on me right now. - Alright, bro, that'll work. Give it to him. - Shit, y'all are crazy. Alright, for sure, boys. - Pleasure doing business with you and your donkey. - Yeah, papered, but we have to pay tomorrow. - What's he getting a poodle for? - Puppy soup. - No shit? - Alright, then. Well, hit me back. - Bro, what you getting a poodle for? - Bro, because when I breed her, that's like 10 G's per litter. - Shit. How much? - She's a rack, but I got a good deal for her. - I know, but how much for the one you're getting? - I just said that. - She's a rack, but I got a good deal. Damn, a rack for a poodle? - Yeah. - I've been saying, man. Fuck, we should have just stole that thing. Shit. - Yeah. Bro, that's fucking crazy shit. - Shit, who are you gonna breed it with? - Hello? - Who's he gonna breed it with, bro? - I don't know, man, but it don't make no sense. - Yeah, if you want to split the litter, you gotta come in on half. - Who you talking to? - I'm talking to Tiberius, man. Chill out. - Man, fuck that motherfucker. - Is it one of those little poodles? - No, it's a legit poodle, bro. - Yeah, bro. Uh... If we get the brindled ones, it's 4 K a dog. - Bro, tell him I said fuck him, bro. If I see him, I'm gonna fuck him up and I'm gonna take his dog. - Bro, you need to calm down, alright? This is business. Plus, he don't have the dog. See, this is the point. I'm trying to have him buy the dog with me. - I could care a less, bro. Still, fuck him. Tell him I said that shit too. - Shit. - Hello? Who are you talking about? - Huh? No, man. We ain't fucking talking about you. - We are fucking talking about you. Man, shut up. Hey, but I'll talk to you later, alright? - Tiberius? What kind of fucking name is that anyway? Did he call Popcorn? - Shit. - Yeah, bro. But remember Popcorn is breeding with Sissy Sanchez now. - Pop this bitch... - Hey, bro. This ain't enough. - I got you. - Alright, thank you, Auntie. - I got him. - Hey, are you guys hiring? - We are not. - No? Echo! Echo! - What? - Is that my baby or did you have another one? Echo! - What do you want? - You. Where you been at? - Home. - Oh. It's like that? - What do you want? - I got you this. - I gotta go. - Why? - Because I don't want to talk to you right now. - Why? - Because I'm mad at you. - Since when? - Since you stole my fucking car and missed your son's baptism. Took that hoe on a run to Denver when I told you my car didn't have tags. - Shit. - Yep. - But like, you don't even know me anymore. I'm a changed man. I'm about to be rich as fuck with a million poodles. - I gotta go. - Ah. - Fuck. - Man, Germ, you're stinking like some fucking ass or something. - You haven't showered in four weeks. - Chee four. - If you laugh, you're in love with Lil' Marty. Alright, alright. - Nay, this guy laughed. - Starting now. - Fucker's out. - Hi. - Stealing from your own dad now, huh? Hello? - No. - Who the fuck ate my sandwich then? - I did. - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. - I need the bed tonight. - Okay. - Alright, I got wheels, rims, catalytic converters, batteries, gas. Oh, and a GPS system. - I can do $250 for everything but the gas. I don't buy gas anymore. - Fuck, would you be able to do at least $400 or $350? - No, it's the end of the month. You'll have to wait till next Thursday when the boss gets back if you want him to take another look. - To be honest, I'm just trying to buy this dog. - What's the best you can do today? - It's $250, man. - Fuck. - I'll take that rice cooker for $20, though. - $20? Alright then. But I gotta sell it with the dishwashing gloves. It's like a two-for-one deal. - Well, how about $22 for both? - Yeah. That sounds good. - Bro, you know anybody looking for any PS4's? - No, we don't buy PS4's, bro. You might have to try Prairie's Edge. - Fuck, alright. - 100 equals 10 to the second power. 10 times 10. 1,000 equals 10 to the third power. 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10 times 10, and so on through the series. Now, we can do it with another number like 2 which is pretty straightforward. Two to the first power equals itself. Two. Two to the second power equals four. Now... following that pattern, what would be the next number in this series? - Two to the fifth power? - Good. - Two to the fifth power. And the answer to that would be what? - 20? - It would be two times two times two times two times two is eight. Two times eight is 16. Two times 16 is 32. So, this is all the material that you're gonna need to know for your quiz on Thursday. Those of you that don't have your notebooks and pencils out, you probably want to get them out and get these down. Any questions on this so far? Does this make sense? Thursday's quiz is going to cover exponents. So, see you tomorrow. - This is a prepaid call from... - Carly. - an inmate at the County Correctional Facility. To decline this call, press nine now, and to accept this call... - Accept. - Thank you. Your call has been accepted. - Hello? - What are you doing? Come bail me. - What the fuck you talking about? How? I don't even have no money. - I don't know, Bill. Figure it out. It's fucking cold in here. - Well, then what the fuck did you do to get there in the first place? - For a traffic violation, Bill. I don't know. Is my son okay? - Duh, what you think? - Well, where is he? - With my mom. - You have 30 seconds left. - Well, man the fuck up and bail me right now, Bill. I'm not fucking playing. - How about you fucking call the homeboy that you've been messaging and have him come bail you? - Oh, you mean homeboy who looks after your son because you're too busy rattling off with your new family to be a fucking dad to him? You rat off all the fucking time. - You know what? Girl, I rat around because I don't even know where we stand, alright? And I ain't got time for this. - bail me out so I can take care of my own goddamn... - Hello? - Hey, man. What you selling? - What up, bro? It's a poodle with papers. - Why the fuck you buying a poodle, man? - Nah, I'm gonna breed her, but I gotta pay this girl tomorrow. - Well, how much then? - Hey, I'm gonna have to call you back. Alright? - No problem. - What's up, man? - Howdy. - You need some help? - Yeah, my front tire's blown out. - Damn. Well, you got any cash on you? I could help you like, take you to Rush or something. - I was hoping maybe you'd take me up to my house and I'll have my boys come back for the truck. - Well, where do you live? - About two miles out of Scottsbluff. - Ooh. Hmm. That's gonna have to cost you. - Yeah? How much? - Shit. Scottsbluff is pretty far. Plus, I need some gas. I'd say at least like, $80. - All right. That'll work. - Alright. Well, hop in. - Alrighty. - What's up, Dad? - What's up, little man? - Nothing. - How was school? - Good. - Tight. Tight. - Well, you wanna play some video games? - Nah, I gotta work. - Why, you still got that one job? - No, those fuckers fired me over some dumb shit. - I'm going to get a job soon. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. So I can get a phone and talk to my girl. - You ain't got no girl. You wanna hit it? I know you smoke. Alright, Snoop. Give me that back now. That's what you get. - I got a hot lunch for you. - You ate already? - Yeah, I ate. - What'd you eat? - Oh, shit. My bad. That was last night, but I'm not even hungry. - Alright. What's that? - A book to learn magic. - Show me a magic trick. - What kind of magic? - I don't know. Show me a card trick, something. - I don't like card tricks. - Why not? - 'Cause it's not real magic. - What's real magic? - Like when you can change things with your mind. - I'll show you a magic trick. I'll make this food disappear. Alright, man. I'm out. - Alright. I'll be in in a bit. - Alright. - You can just pull over here. Wait here for a second. Say, Bill. How'd you like to make another $100? - Shit, how so? - The thing is I'm supposed to have dinner with my wife and I was hoping that you'd do me a favor and head out to the truck and swap out that tire for me. - Hmm. Is it all yours? - Yep. It's all mine. - Hmm. I could do it for $200. - Okay. Here's the thing, Bill. The important thing here is that... I got a girl out in that truck. - Ooh. And I'm going to need you to give her a ride home. Could you do that for me? - Sure. Where does she stay? - I don't know. You'll have to ask her. Somewhere on the rez, I think. - Oh, shit. Shit, I mean that's like a couple hours to go pick her up and an hour back to Ridge, plus I don't even know where she'll be staying. I'm gonna need a little bit more than $200. - How much more? - $400. - $400? - And a job. - And a job? What makes you think I got a job for you? - I mean... You got two big houses, big 'ol land. You must be doing something right. - Uh-huh. I'll tell you what. I'm not gonna give you $400, but we can see about the job. What do you think? - Yeah, well, I appreciate all that, but I gotta go get my son to the dentist. I'm gonna have to pass. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up, hold up, hold up. I'll do $300... and you might be in luck with the job, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. I could do that. Throw it in the trunk. - Alrighty. - Check this out. - That's pretty cool. - I waited six fucking months for this little bastard, man. They sent it to two or three P.O. boxes before they finally got us. I spaced them out. Yeah. Alright, little man. See you later. Alright. See you, Dad. - Yeah. - Fuck! - What are you doing, bro? - Don't come barging in like that next time. - My bad. - Fuck this guy. Scared you shitless? Or shirtless? - Here you go, bro. Check it out. This here, my boy, is Epsom salt. - Ha, I ain't your fuckin' son. - You good? - Yeah. - I'm Bill. I'm taking you home. Go ahead. You can just get in. - Look at these little guys. - Fucking mutts, forget about it. - Who's looking? - Who's all looking? - Is this shit good, or what? - It's good stuff, bro. - Yeah, it's legit. - Who's your dad? Arnie Whitehorse. - Get the fuck outta here. - Whitehorse's kid out here trying to sell me his own fucking drugs. How much? - 50 bucks. - 35. - 45! - 45? This kid... - 45? Man. - Whitehorse. - Arnie Whitehorse. - Fuck. - Alright. Let's go then. - Yo, let's go around the back. That guy was fucking... - What'd you guys get? - Just wait till we get home. - What is it? - Wait till we get home. - What is this shit, bro? - What? - This shit's fake as fuck. What'd y'all give me? What is this? Fuck! - Run! - Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - What the fuck you doing here? - He's trying to beat us up! - Who? - That guy! - What'd you do? - I don't know what we did! - What the fuck did you do? - Who, this guy? That's my son. That's your fuckin... - Yeah, that's my fucking son! What's good, bitch?! - You want some? - Right here then, WWE style. Where were you? - I think I found a job. - Doing what? - Working for some white guy. I made like, 300 taking some people home. - Like a taxi? - I don't know. I guess. But I'll be doing more stuff, too. - Well, good. You could bail Carly. The kid would be happy. - He already looks happy. - That's 'cause he's sleeping. - I saw you dance before. You're a really good dancer. - Thanks. - Can I have a kiss? - Does it hurt? - I'll be gentle. - I wasn't talking about that. - Oh. What were you talking about? - Your face. - Oh, shit. My bad. - Um.. I don't want to do it here. - Okay. - Come here. - Man, you're really goofy, huh? - You still love me. Why don't you come outside? - Holy fuck. - What? - What the fuck is that? - What do you mean? What do you mean, what is it? It's a poodle. - I know it's a fucking poodle, you idiot. Where'd you even get her at? - Does it really matter? - You probably stole it. - What makes you think I stole it? Don't be thinking like that. I bought it. - The most goofiest shit I've ever heard. Only you would buy some white lady-type dog, I swear. - I'm gonna tell everybody that she's yours so I don't look like a pussy. - Fuck no, you better not tell nobody that's my dog. - Why not? - Why would you even buy it? Why the fuck would you even invest in something like this? - 'Cause, you know, it's not just mine. It's yours too. - So, what? What do you plan to do? - I don't know. What do you want to do with it? It's half yours. - I can't take care of no fucking dog, Bill. - That's alright. She's hella great, though. She could make us rich. Buy you that car. Buy you some new clothes. I'mma get us a trailer and give you more baby boys. Oh, you're a fucking rat. - And you're beautiful. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. You know... - So, what's up? - She wants you to come outside. I want you to come outside. Please? - You're fucking crazy. - You need some help? - No, I'm good. - All right. - Oh, shit. - Here, can you hold this? - For what? - Because you're gonna stay with me. - Oh, my God. - Yo, what the fuck did you do? You really think I would notice, you stupid little fuck?! Fuck you! Look at me! Look at me! Fight back! Fight back, bitch! Fight back! You're a bitch! Fight me! You're gonna get me fucking killed! Fight back. Come on, son. You putting salt in my fucking shit! You think I wouldn't notice it? Get the fuck out of my house. I don't want you here no more. - Hey, Bill! Come on up! - Here you go. Okay. So, the whole point of wine, Bill, is sipping it slowly so you can enjoy it. - Oh, shit. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - So, do you have any holiday plans this year? - Hmm. Not really. Probably just try to hang out with my kids. - I didn't know you had kids. - Mm-hmm. I got two sons. - Wow. Two sons. That's amazing. - So listen, Bill. We own Fall River Farms and there's a bunch of positions opening up at the plant and I was thinking we could get you started over there because I know you could do with more work. - So adorable. - What do you think? - Yeah, I'd appreciate that. - Thanksgiving is obviously our busiest time of year and we're providing to three new suppliers this year which is huge for us. - Huge. - Yeah. - Yeah, Bill. Bill should help with Halloween. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, because last year, we hired this Mexican company from Rapid and, well, one of the employees pooped on our lawn. - Okay, honey. It wasn't a Mexican thing. It was just a bad manners thing. - No, he was Mexican. - He just happened to be Mexican. That's not why... I mean, come on. - We can laugh about it now. Like I'm laughing, but at the time, it really wasn't that funny. - Look, someone shat on our lawn, who happened to be Mexican, okay? Anyway, I'd still love to keep you around the house doing personal stuff if you'd be open to, you know, having two jobs, but we don't need to get into all that today. - Oh, my gosh. Who's this little doggie? - Oh, that's Beast. I'm breeding her, trying to start my own business. - Beast? That's an interesting name. - Yeah. My son named her, so no rez dogs would fuck with her. I love that. You really are... You're just, you're so different. - He's smart, honey. Unlike most of the other guys around here. - Oh, who is this? - Someone that's dead to me. - Oh, sweetie. I'm so sorry. - No, it's all right. - No, no, it isn't. You poor thing. When did she pass? - Huh? - When did she die? - We just broke up. Oh! I thought she died. - All right, Bill. So what did you do? - Nothing. - Come on. You must have done something. - Nothing. - Nothing at all, huh? - See, this is my new girlfriend. We also got a kid together. - Aww. - Wow. Well, you want to hang onto that one, buy her lots of presents. Tell her she's always right. Trust me with this. Let me tell you something. If there were no women in the world, money would have no meaning. Matter of fact, Allie, why don't you take Bill up to your jewelry box and give him something you don't wear anymore so he can give it to... What's her name, Bill? - Echo. - Ethyl? - Echo. - Echo? - Echo. - These I got from Alaska. - Cool. - But you don't want these, though. - Why? - They have bad juju. Me and Tim, we almost got divorced that trip. We almost get divorced a lot, but... Um... I think Echo would like these. Dreamcatchers. - Hmm. What about those ones? - Uh... These? You picked my favorite. - You just gonna give them to me? - Yeah. I'm just gonna give them to you. - Wow. Thank you. - So, anything else? - No, I'm alright. - Okay, great. - I got you this. - Hi. - I need some place to stay. - Why? - My dad kicked me out of the house. - Okay. I got three rules if you're gonna be staying here with me. No fighting in the house. Keep it real with me, and you gotta go to school every day. Go ahead and get comfortable. Pick a shelf. This is where you're gonna be staying. Don't bring no drama into my tipi, okay? - Okay. Thanks. - Coffee time. - Thanks. - It ain't him. - Whoa. - I'm still mad at you. - I know. But you love me. Everything's gonna be different this time. - No, keep it. Keep it. You alright? - Yeah. - So how'd you get the job? Tim? - Yeah. - This is one turkey shed over here, then there's like, three or four down that way. All right, they might be a little loud, so beware. - Alright. - They're crazy, too. Rowdy. Really rowdy. Been locked up 24/7. You got asthma? - No. - This is the turkey jerky room. This is the layout. The snipping. The weighing. This is probably where you will start out. And then, we have the packaging back there. Yeah. - Hello? - This is a prepaid call from... - Carly. Pick up the phone, bitch. - Sit. Come on, girl. Sit. Beast. Please! Sit. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! - Hey, you need to come get her. She's not feeling great. - Like how? Is she okay? - Yeah, I don't fucking know. She was like this when I picked her up. You just need to get her out of here. - That's not good. Well, fuck. What am I supposed to do? - Um, it's up to her. Whatever she wants. - Hey. Hey! I think this is it. I don't speak Lakota. - Matho. - We've been looking all over for you. - What? - Bro, I'm sorry to tell you this. They found your dad in the creek. - I'm sorry. - I'm finally home. I gazed upon the Lord's sweet, smiling face... And for the first time in my life... I knew and felt His grace. - Can I have a cigarette? - Hey, I'm gonna head out. - Hey, Bill. Come here. Share this glass with me. Goddamn. What's up? - Who the fuck let you out? - Long time, no see, bitch. Where's my money at? - Shit. I don't know where that shit is. - Well, I heard you got an expensive new dog and a fancy job, so you must have some money. - Are you mad at me? - No. I don't expect much from you. - Ugh... - What you mean, "Ugh?" - Like, "Ugh, why can't you just be nice to me?" - You're fucking weird, man. What's that? - It's some wine. - Look at you trying to act all brand new and shit. - I just got some acquired taste. Oh, I gotta fucking throw up. - I ain't fucking playing with you, Bill. Man, I want my fucking money. - Bet. Oh... - Come on, Bill. Get up. - What? - Nothing. - Hurry up. I gotta go. - Who gave you all those hickeys? Huh? Fuck! Where's Beast? - I don't know. - Well, what about Carly? - I have no clue. - Oh, my God. - Fucking idiot. - Hey, did you guys see my dog? - No. - Hello? Yeah, I could do that. - Stop doing that. Could I use the bathroom? Watch the fuck out! What's up? - Hey. Hey, Matho. Matho! - Get out of there! Hustle! Boy, go on! Get out of here! - Ah. There you are! Don't run, now. Don't run. Relax, now. Relax. Relax. Relax, now. We'll go to the office, okay? Let's find out what the trouble is. Relax, now. Okay? All right, we're gonna go. - It's Carly. Leave me a message. - You want some turkey jerky? - No. - Well, we're going to have to make a short stop. - How short? - Where's Carly at? - Jail. They took her back this morning. - Well, did you see my dog? - No. - What the fuck do you want? - Motherfucker, my motherfucking dog! - I sold your little bitch ass dog. - Sold him to who? - To the only other motherfucker down here that's dumb enough to sell fucking poodles on the fucking rez. - Man, you shouldn't even be taking people's shit like that. - You know what? That's pretty fucking funny coming from your little bitch ass, Bill. You left me in jail to go buy a fucking dog, so stay in your little fucked up lane, alright? Fuck you. - Ooh. Come on. - What are you doing? You can't drive with him like this. - Why? - Because he don't have a car seat. Yeah, I don't have a car seat. - Well, then maybe you shouldn't be driving with him in the first place. - Oh, my God. Listen, I like that you care, but can you just mind your damn business for five minutes? Hey, I need you to watch Mason. - Where are you going? - I have to go find Beast real quick. - Oh, no, no no. I have to go to the volleyball game. - It'll take an hour. I'll be right back, okay? I'm sorry. - Hey, come on, now. You're such a butthead. - Has anybody got a taser? - What the fuck are you going to do with a taser if she has a gun? - Shit, bro. You ever get tased? That shit hurts worse, more than a bullet. - Hello? Hey, yo. Where's my dog at? Yo! - What? - I said, where's my dog at? - I don't fucking know, man. Why the fuck is everyone coming at me today for? - I'm just looking for my dog. I'm not trying to come at you, bro. - Look, if y'all don't know the fucking poodle business, man, there's nothing I can do for you. So, can you please get the fuck out? - Oh, all right. Chill, bro. I'm gone, alright? She had her babies? Yes! Go. Go get the boys. Goddamn. What did you even do? Help me get these in. Yeah. Look what you did. - One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine. - Shh. Be quiet. - That's $18,000. - Shh! - She's cute. - Look, it gots waves. Oh, I missed you. Where'd you go? - Hello? - Come on, come on. The Bible tells us to rejoice in hope, to be patient in tribulation. There's a lot of problems in our country and... I don't... God knows that, and so do we. If we look at creation, and we look at everything around... - What the fuck is this? - They didn't give you extra pineapple? - Fuck, I told them. - Hey, bro. My dad will go back in there if they forgot the extra pineapple and they'll just put them on for free. - Let me have some. - Alright, man. - I didn't have none. - that'll save you, it'll save me. It'll save all of us. - What's up? Well, why have you been leaving me on seen? - Is it true you got suspended for meth? - Who said that? - Thelma. - Well, nay. That's not even true. - What'd you get suspended for? - Why do you care? - My mom said I'm not allowed to hang around you anymore. - Why? - Because she don't trust you. - Well, she don't even know me. Tell her to invite me over. - I don't even want to be with you anymore. - We're not even together. I only snagged you that one time. - Save it, because you're disgusting. I ain't trying to be with someone who can't even get through high school. - Well, fuck you, bitch. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. - Why are you home from school? - I think I'm sick. I don't feel good. - Hmm. What kind of sick are you? - My stomach kind of hurts, and I have a sore throat. - What are my rules? - Don't lie. - Speak up. - Don't lie, don't fight, and go to school. - They called my house phone. - I'll work for you for free. - Excuse me? - If you let me stay, I'll work for you for free. - Okay, listen. You got in trouble, and you told me you're staying with me, and now you got the whole school paying attention to me. You can't work for me at all. - But they didn't find anything. I hid it. That was the Buddy Red Bow track there. I hope you guys enjoyed that. - Get out. - You're listening to KILI radio... - Can I eat first? Fuck. - Yo, I have to get some gas. - Fuck. - Bro, what's wrong with you? You mad at me? - No, you're too fucking stupid to get mad at. What do you mean by that? - You're fucking boring. You think you're interesting, and you're not. Nobody gives a fuck about your baby mamas or your fucking stupid stolen dog. - Hey, man. Don't call her stupid. She's not stupid. You're stupid. - Alright. Well, text Tim. Tell him I'm gonna be late. - What do you mean, text Tim? Why don't you just text Tim if y'all are so close? - I never said we was close. - Alright, then. So what is it that y'all be doing? What does he do? Does he pay you or something? What's the deal? - That's not your business. We just fucking kick it. - You just kick it? Okay. You know that he has a lot of girlfriends, right? - So? That's not my place. - Ah, fuck. - What's wrong? - She's about to trip. - What? - Just stay in the car. - I swear you're not playing with a full deck. - Ah, I'm kilt now. - Fuck. - Fuck. I don't like that kinda energy, bro. - You're so fucking stupid. - What? - What the fuck? - Don't trip. - What do you mean, don't trip? - Let's go. I'll explain. - Explain what? - Beast got stolen. - What? - Come on, Beast got stolen. - Who's in your car, Bill? - It's a girl from work. I have to give her a ride home - What do you mean a ride home? - It's my job. - What kind of job requires you have to give bitches rides? Why you pushing me like that? - Come here. - Move! I gotta fucking go! - I need you to calm the fuck down. - Wow. Look at your fucking neck! - Man, you're fucking tripping. - Why the fuck you got hickeys on your neck? - What? - What? - What? - Let's fucking go! - You're fucking gross! - Oh, my God. - Are you taking me, or what? - Let me take you home. - What, with your other fucking bitch? - Gross. I just met him a couple hours ago, but okay. - Shut up! - Get the fuck away from me. - Get in the car then. - Fuck you! - Don't tell me what the fuck to do. - Go! - You fucking go! - Go! Damn, you're in the car. - This sacrifice, this ancient spell... I hope the land receives it well. And so beneath the moons descent, I hope my loved one might rise again. - Wake up, wake up, wake up. What happened right here? You got bit? - I did. - Matho! - Yo, bro, I could ask my grandma if you could spend the night. - I asked my mom, but she wasn't into it. - Bro, I'm good. I'll probably just stay here for a bit. - But, bro, it's boarded up. - Well, I can maybe go get some stuff, and go decorate it or something. - But where are you gonna get furniture and all that stuff? - Maybe I'll just go on the swap. I only need some blankets and a TV. - I could call my auntie and see if she has an old TV she don't want no more. - Bro, if you want to make it look nice, you could get some plants, too. - Yeah, and maybe just like a couch to sit on. - Yeah, maybe from the dollar store or somewhere. - You could also just steal it. - It's broken. - It is. I gotta get that fixed. I shocked you? My bad. Oh, motherfucker. Damn. Hey. - Echo! - You locking me out now? - What do you want, Bill? - Beast had her puppies. - Wow. - Yo, could I talk to you for a second? - About what? - I was just driving that girl home, and I don't even know her name and I just wanted to tell you that I'm getting promoted at work too so I'll have more money to help you. - Anything else? - What are you doing tonight? - Why? - Because I want to know. - So I could watch Mason? - No. - I have a fucking kid, Bill. What else would I be doing? - Well, let me watch him. Yeah, let me watch him. It's Halloween. Go out and have some fun. - Don't you have work? - No. - Okay. That would help. Thanks. - Yeah, you're welcome. You boys okay? Okay, I'll be back to check on you guys every 10 minutes, alright? - Yeah. - I'll just be right over there. Okay? - Yeah. - Watch out for your brother and those puppies. And you got Beast to protect you, alright? All right, I love you. - Love you. - Hi. - Hi. - You guys look great. Spooky. - Thank you. You too. - I'm Allison. Bill, you know me. - Nice to meet you. - Alright, yep. - So, you could help these guys out. They're catering. - Um... I got somebody coming tonight that I think wants to buy one of your pups. - Man, no shit. For real? - Yeah, man. - Alright then. - We have faders, we have all these Halloween decorations... - Let's go. - Bro, let's go. - What the fuck you looking at, man? - Hey Bill, could you take that for me? - Man, you gotta have a mixer. A chaser. - It's kinda gross. Oh, damn. - There's leftover back there. - Sell this or drink it? - Just drink it. - Are we gonna sell this or drink it? - Drink it. - Give me that. - Scared me. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Just looking for some bottles for upstairs. - Oh, okay. Well, don't let me interrupt you. You know, I know about his little girlfriends. It's okay. It's not like... It's not like a thing. We don't need to talk about it or anything. - Okay. - But, like, it's easier for him now. Because he has you, who lives at the rez and... Before, he was just finding these girls on Facebook and... - I don't... I don't know nothing about that. - Oh. Well, I do. I read his messages. You know, and like... I really don't get it. I don't get it. Personally, I don't really see the appeal, if you know what I mean. I don't know if he's got, like, an Indian fetish or they're the only ones that he can con into having sex with him. - Like I said, I don't know anything about that. - But like, technically... Technically, you're like sex trafficking. And you could go to jail for that. And you know, like, you know that you're not... You're not any different from them. - I think I better get back to work. - Let's go. Nobody saw. - What are we doing? - My Auntie's not coming back tonight. - Where is she? - They're all gone for the weekend. - How do you know she's not coming back? - Come on. Get in there. - Okay. - What are we gonna get? - Look for the blue bag. She keeps all her guns and meth in there. - Wait, what are we getting? - Shh, shut the fuck up. Just find the blue bag. Let's get the fuck out of here. - Here. Yes, yes, yes. - Hustle. - This one. - Yeah! Let's go. - Alright, here you go. Screwdriver in the ignition. - Put it in the ignition. Try turning it into the... There you go. Ooh! Holy fuck. Fucking fruit. - I know. - Weirdo. - Fruits these days. - Swing it! Disgusting. - When you gonna pass it? - Little Worm... Pass it. - Pass it back. - Little Worm. - Bro, pass the blue bag to the back. Where are we going? - Bro, let's go to Denver and sell all of this. - Where is Denver? - Holy shit! ♪ I used to have demons ♪ In my room at night ♪ Desire, despair ♪ Desire ♪ So many monsters ♪ Oh, but now ♪ I don't find myself bouncing around ♪ ♪ Whistling my conscience to make me cry ♪ ♪ No more I love you's ♪ - Come on. Talk back there or something, bro. It's pretty quiet. - I'm trying to roll. - I already know. - Let me try some. - You want some? Alright. I ain't giving you that much. - Fuck. - Oh, bro. I got something to my arm. - Bro, where the fuck are you going? - My fucking head... - What's wrong with him? - Bro, we gotta go. - Man, you're fucking scaring me. Bro, I mean it, bro. We gotta go. - Then fucking leave! - Let's go. We gotta go. Bro, we ain't taking responsibility for that. Let's go. - Someone grab that blue bag. - Oh. Thanks, Bill. This one's for me, and this one's for you guys. Drive safe, alright? - What about that guy? - What guy? - That guy that you said would buy that dog? - Oh. Well, I know Luis here doesn't... He doesn't want a dog, because he's allergic to dogs. Isn't that right? Yeah. Hot Dog, you want a dog? - What kind of dog is it? - It's a poodle. - Absolutely not. Uh... Cynthia, devil woman, you want a poodle? - No. - No? - Omar, do you want a poodle? - No, man. I already got a dog. - All right. Well... I guess nobody wants a poodle, Bill. - Mm-hmm. - Where did that kid get a poodle? - Oh, shit. - Yo, what the fuck, bro? - What are you guys doing? What are you doing out of the car, son? - I needed to go to the bathroom. - Poor guy. Are you all right? Shit, I'm sorry. Where's my dog? Did you see where she went? - I can't see shit. - Are you okay? Aw, don't cry. Hold on. Hang on. Hang on. - What's going on, bud? Quit crying. - Aw, little guy. - Where the fuck is she? - Fuck, man. It's cold as fuck. - Can you guys see her? - No, bro. Where the fuck's she at, man? - Beast! - Beast! Beast! Beast! - What was that? Holy shit. Holy shit. - Bro, bro, bro, bro, bro! - Holy fuck, man. - Oh, my God. - Bill! What the fuck happened? - Yo, he shot my homie's dog. Man, that's some fucking bullshit. - Okay, you need to calm down right fucking now or I'll call the police. - You killed my homie's dog over a fucking turkey! - Why are you in my face? - Why the fuck are you in my fucking face?! Don't you put your hands on me. - Whoa. - Go home, Bill. - I don't think I could take care of these... - Shay. - And maybe you should keep them. And I'm really sorry. Well, I guess I'll see you around. - What are you doing? Are you okay? You got a name? Are you hungry? What do you want, pancakes? A sandwich? - I want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. - Alright. Well, go sit down. I'll make it for you. Do you like coffee? Well, you will whenever you grow up. - Who's calling, please? - What's up? - What's up? - Sit down. - I was wondering if you could pay out my wages for me. - Uh-huh. Okay. Um... Your dog killed one of the turkeys, contaminated my personal pen and you punched my cousin in the face. - Yeah, but I worked them two weeks and I didn't get paid for it, so I'm just asking for what you owe. - Okay. You get me 45 turkeys, and then we can talk about your pay. How's that? - She didn't even do shit to 45 turkeys. She killed one, but it was on accident, and where the fuck am I gonna get 45 turkeys from? - I don't know. You could always try getting a job. Or you could steal them. Or you could do a fucking rain dance. - You fucking killed my dog. I worked them days, I chopped your wood, I cleaned your fucking closet, I took them bitches everywhere for you. - Alright, are you done? - I don't fucking know. Are you gonna pay me? - I'm not gonna pay you because you fucked up. So I think that you should probably go now. And we'll leave it at that. - Over here. - Hey. - Ooh, yeah. - Let's go! Hurry up! - Oh, my God!
