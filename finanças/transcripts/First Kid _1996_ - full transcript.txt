NOW, YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER WOULD HAVE. SOONER OR LATER THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN. TRUST ME, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LATER. I'M HERE. I CARE. YEAH, SO? IT'S YOUR JOB. YOU DON'T EVEN LIKE IT. "I JUST GOTTA KEEP HIM OUT OF TROUBLE TILL I GET BUMPED TO EAGLE." DID--DID I GET THAT RIGHT? I SHOULD'VE NEVER SAID THAT. I WAS ANGRY WITH YOU. YOU MAKE ME LOOK STUPID AT MY JOB. YOU THROW A SNAKE ON ME, YOU SNEAK OUT THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAID IT. I'M SORRY. COME ON, LUKE, YOU GOT A PRETTY GOOD LIFE HERE. YOU'RE THE FIRST KID. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO RUN AWAY? I CAN'T GO OUT. I--I NEVER SEE MY PARENTS. I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS. I'VE NEVER KISSED A GIRL. THAT WOULD DO IT. I UNDERSTAND. THAT WOULD MAKE ME RUN AWAY MYSELF. I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO LIVE LIKE THIS WHEN YOU WERE A KID. YOU WERE LUCKY. OH, I SEE. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS SOME PROBLEMS IN LIFE. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MYSELF.
