What are you doing? I almost hit you. [sighs] That was luck. I could've killed you, standing out in the middle of the road like that. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I'm sorry I scared you. - I know you. You're from Prairie, ain't you? - I'm Robby. - Robby. I'm Rose. - Hi, Rose. - Hi. Listen, your folks know you're way out here by yourself? - Downed some beers, too, Rose. Gonna catch it when I get home. I could sneak in, maybe. - Yeah, if you can get there. - That's right too, Rose, get there. [Paco squawks] - [sighs] Come on. Get in. Get in. Ah. This here's Paco. We can chuck him in the back. - I can hold him. - Well, watch your fingers, though. He's real rowdy. Nobody likes him much but me. - Why do you? - Well, we had a gas leak one time. You know gas is supposed to kill a bird. Well, Paco made it through. Kind of warmed me up to him. He's a survivor. - Well, that's good, too. Hello, Paco, nice bird, pretty bird. [Rose laughs] Ow. Hey! - I told ya. - He bites. [Rose laughs] [upbeat bluegrass music] - [Rose] So how do you come to be way out here all by yourself? - Oh, um, my friends, they made me get out of the car. - And left you, why? - I don't know, Rose. A joke? - Ain't funny to do you like that. That's just plain mean. - Aw, no, they don't mean it. My friends good guys, everything. - I'd say you're too good for them. - Thanks, Rose. You are too. - [chuckles] Hey, you hungry? [upbeat country music] I'm working in Prairie. I'm taking care of old Miss Thomson. You know her? But I was up to Wichita today to see my daddy. I took Paco along for company. I don't know a soul in Prairie. - [Robby] You know me, Rose. - That's right. - We could be friends. I could visit you, but I wouldn't want to bother you. - I'd like that, Robby. Pretty easy to get along with, seems to me. - That's right, too, Rose. I'm easy.

Always worked for me! [Robby laughing] - Scott, Robby, come on in and wash those hands, boys. - Okay, Ma! - Okay, Grandma. - Did you think about what I was saying the other night? - Yeah, I thought about it. - Dad, you guys are getting older. - Who is? - I know, but we ought to be thinking about some kind of future for him. If we could get him on Social Security, it'd-- - We'll do like we always done. We'll keep it in the family. You let the government mix in, the next thing-- - You think I'd ever let that happen? - They'll put him in an institution. - Are you gonna give me some of your piece? - I wanted that piece! - Robby! Robby, would you say the grace tonight? - We thank thee, Lord, for all this good food and all thy blessings, and for Rose, amen. - Who's Rose? - What's this now? - She's my friend. She's nice. - Well, where you know her from? - Gave me a ride. - Robby, you ought to know when you've been took advantage of by freeloaders so many times. - No, Dad, she's nice! She works for Miss Thomson! Bought me a chili burger and fries, everything. She's nice. - Do you know who he's talking about? - I'll look into it. - [Robby] Miss Thomson, she looks pretty sick, Rose. - Yeah, it's sad, all right. - [Host] At 49-- - She likes to have her TV on, but Lord knows if she gets it, poor old soul. See, I'm supposed to get my keep here, room and board and 50 bucks a week, but old Miss Thomson's daughter's so tight, she squeaks. She keeps track of what I eat, so I bought this stuff on my own. I keep it hid because if she sees I actually bought something, she thinks she's overpaying me. Let's go. This is my friend Robby. He come to spend my day off with me. Bye, now. - Don't be late, please. - I like to come here to think. So how come is it I see you just kind of wandering around? Don't you have a job or nothing? - Oh, I mow lawns. Rake leaves sometimes. - That'd be all right. - I work in a restaurant. - Hey, it's okay. You just take your time. I ain't going nowhere. - Worked in a restaurant. - Well, see? That's good. - With my brother Kenny. He looks out for me. He's in the Highway Patrol. - Won't they let you work in that restaurant alone? - I don't like it, Rose, cleaning up garbage and everything. - Mm, I can't say as I blame you. - And when I was cleaning, people, some people, they talked to me like-- - Like what? - Oh, hey, you! Dummy, retard! - [scoffs] Jerks. - Yeah, and I'm not retarded! A little slow, a few problems, no big deal! - Sure. Hey, can you read? - Oh, I sure can, Rose. I can write, too. - Great! - Yeah. - Here, try this. [sentimental acoustic guitar music] Right there. - "Co-co-a." - Cocoa. - Cocoa powder, milk solids. - [chuckles] Well, you can read the want ads, then. Okay, now I always read the entire want ads 'cause, well, you never know what you might find. Plus, it's kind of fun thinking about other jobs, especially when yours stinks. Like here, you go ahead. Now, look under Y for yard work, okay? - Oh, here he is, Jim. - Mom! - Good, Robby, we wanna-- - Dad, you know what? I'm in love! - Holy Joe, Robby, don't. You're letting her manipulate you. - No, Dad, no, she helps me. - Now, Robby, listen. Your brother looked into this, huh? Now, this woman is a loose woman. - No! - Oh, she's a mess. She's a drinker. - No, Dad, no! - She's had two husbands walk out on her. Now, what does that tell ya? And that ain't the worst. - She has a bird, Paco, sits close to me, pretty, smells nice, talks nice, everything. - Now, look, Robby, listen. Now, we've talked about this kind of thing before. Do you remember how bad you felt that time the boys took you to Wichita? - Oh, Dad, don't! Those were whores! - [Jim] Now, boy, now wait a minute. - Rose is not a whore! - Listen, Robby! - [Emma] Robby! - [Jim] Robby, Robby. - She's not, not, Dad! She's not a whore! - Just let me talk to ya. - Well, she is not. - Robby, just calm down. Let me-- - Let me. Let me just talk to him, Jim. - All right. - Robby, now listen. There are girlfriends, and then there are women who will take advantage. - No, she-- - No one's saying that you can't have a girlfriend. That was all fine when that girlfriend that you had from the school came down-- - Oh, Ma, she was-- - Hell, she wasn't much. - That's right, too, Dad, wasn't much. - Now, look, I know you think you're just like everybody else, in most ways you are, but there are some ways you ain't the same. - Jim. - Now, you just do as I say! You stay away from her. - But... [crickets chirping] [dog barking] - [gasps] Robby! [chuckles] What are you doin'? - I wanna come in. - Shh, well, you can't. I'm in bed! - I'm coming in! - [Rose] Sh! - I'm coming in. - At least you're loaded. - Here I come. - You can't come in here! - Yes, I am. - Hey, you aren't coming in here like, quit it! [Robby groans] You ain't coming in! - I am. - [Rose] You're gonna get me fired. - I'm coming in to-- - Shh, shh, shh. - I'm coming in to see ya. - Do you know what? Let me pour this out. - No, I'm sorry, Rose! - Shh, please, shh! - No, Rose! - Stuff just makes it easier for people to think you ain't playing with a full deck! - I know! - 'Cause you ain't when you're all juiced up! - I know, Rose, but I wanted that! - Shh! - I wanted that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're sweet, Rose. - You're sweet, too, but I don't need no more drunks in my life. Now, you just get on home and sleep it off. - They say no, no. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. You're my friend. That's all. - That's right. - That's all. - That's right. Good night. [sentimental country music] - Good night, Rose. [pins crashing] [people whooping] [pins crashing] [Rose squeals] - Wow! - You dirty dog, you've been holding out on me! - I sure did, Rose. I did. - Okay. You gotta give me some pointers, then, okay? - All right, okay. - Okay. - All right. You gotta bring the ball way far back, okay? - Okay, now you gonna watch me? - Yeah, I am. - Okay, ready? Go! [pins crashing] - All right, Robby. - [Robby] All right! - [Jim] Robby, you get on out to the front, son. - No, Dad, I stay with Rose! - No, not no more you ain't. - Dad, I don't wanna-- - Excuse me. - Don't you worry, lady! We know all about your kind! - Mom, Dad, I don't want to go, Dad. No, Dad, I stay with Rose. I don't wanna go home, Ma! - Listen. I don't know who you think you're talking to, but you don't know nothing about me! - I know the welfare took your kids away. Ain't nobody more low down than that. I don't know what your game is, if you're after him for money or sex or what! - You're out of your mind! - But you can run your tail on down the road. There ain't nothing for you here! [engine roars] - You got no right to go judging me. - We take care of our family! - If you hurt him, I'll... - You are gonna stay away from that slut! - She's not a slut!

Okay, what happened to your face? - Oh, I'm all right. I hitchhiked, Rose. I knew you'd be here. - Oh, gosh, you don't even have a coat on and it's freezing. Here, get in the car. Come on. I've got a blanket up here somewhere. Here, put this around you. Oh, Robby, your hands are freezing. [Robby coughs] So what happened? - Oh, my dad, he bam across the face. Yeah. - I should get some water and clean this-- - No, no, Rose, stay here. I feel better this way, like this. - Okay. You're awful sweet, Robby. I'm sorry I got you into so much trouble. - No. - What he said about my kids, well, [sighs] someday I'll tell you. - You don't have to, Rose. - But you gotta believe that I never had no sexual designs on you. Listen, after the hell I went through in my marriages, I ain't even thought about sex in a hundred years. - Oh, I love you, Rose. You're all mine. [sentimental acoustic guitar music] - Robby, we shouldn't be doing this. - But I'm so happy, Rose. I've waited and waited, and now I'm happy. Aren't you happy? - Yes, I am. - Rose. I want to take your clothes off. - Me too. - Mine, too? I'm so hyped up, hands are shaking. - Here. [sentimental country music] [gravel crunching] [engine rumbling] [door knocking] - Rose Parks, you here? - Who wants me? I'm busy. - [Ken] Ken Smith, Highway Patrol, I'd like a word with you. - Ken, you Robby's brother? Sure, hold on. I'll be with you in just two shakes, darling. - Good morning. - [Rose] Morning. - I understand you've been keeping Robby out all hours of the night, doing who knows what. Robby's not capable of making decisions like this for himself. - Hell he ain't. - That's exactly the attitude that we're not putting up with. My family had good control of Robby until you started mixing in. - Yeah, sure, he had a great life, getting drunk, getting kicked around. - Okay, maybe you'll understand this. Keep away from him. I'm a law officer. - Yeah, I can see you are. - And I'll see you in jail before I let you or anybody else exploit my brother.

For you, it's free. - I guess if we got any chance at all. - Well, I think so, yeah. - Well, we're on. - All right? - Right. - We're on! [Charlie chuckles] [people socializing] Hi, guys! - [Jim] Hey, buddy. [Robby laughing] - Oh, you've been all right. - Oh! - Hi, Ken. - Hi, son. How are you doing? - Say hi to Rose? - Rose, Rose, hold on. Hold on. - I can't testify. I can't. - Oh, Rose, for God's sake. - No. They'll work on me and turn everything I say around. I know how they are. Robby, I'm sorry. I just can't do it. [sobs] - Rose, Rose, now look at me. Look at me. You're the only one who can prove to the judge that Robby would be better off living with you. - But I can't do it. - Well, if we're all here, let's get started. The state calls Mr. Kenneth Smith. - Robby and I were always together. Besides being brothers, we were friends. Used to help me with my paper route, played sports with me and my friends. And when I started dating, he couldn't understand why he couldn't come along, too. I spent time with him, found him jobs. I just always looked out for him. Seemed natural. - That's right, too, Kenny, natural. - According to the tests, he has an IQ of 58, which is mild retardation. Apart from the alcohol, which he no longer drinks, his chief problem has been that his family has kept him from any ongoing treatment or training. His relationship with Rose Parks, in my opinion, is a healthy influence. - Rose Parks has a history of alcohol abuse, multiple marriages, and parental negligence to the point where the state of Kansas took away her children. She is not an appropriate role model. - You don't know what it's like 'til you raise a boy like that. Sometimes I come down hard on Robby 'cause I was worried for him. You've got to watch out all the time so no harm will come to him. - Now, Robby, do you understand what we're working on today? - Sure, Judge, uh-huh. - See, we are trying to find the best person to help you when you need a little help with your life. - Right, good. - Now, your brother Ken would like to be that person. - All right. - But Dr. Roche thinks that you've had some problems with your family, and that maybe it would be better if this lady, Rose Parks, helped you. - Okay, real good. - Your attorney is suggesting that if it isn't Rose Parks, then an independent person who does this work professionally would be the best choice. - Fine. - I'd like to know what you think, Robby. - Well, to me, I think, to me, if it's just... Well, sure, that's fine with me, sure. - Mm-hm, how do you and Ken get along? - Oh, we get along good, sure. - And Rose Parks, how is it living with her? - Oh, good, fine. She's my best friend. - And Mr. Hobart here, what do you think of him? - Oh, Jake? Oh, he's my buddy. - And Dr. Roche and Mr. Parks? - Oh, great guys. I like you, too, Judge. - Thank you, Robby. I like you, too. Well, clearly, everybody in this courtroom cares about Robby and what happens to him. In keeping him at home, his parents felt that they were doing what was best for Robby. They cared for him, they loved him, and he loved them back. - Oh, you bet. - But every child decides at some point that he wants to live his own life. And Robbie deserves the chance to reach his full potential, so I'm appointing Ken Smith Robby's guardian and conservator. Now, Robby can stay with Rose Parks for now, but within 60 days, I want Ken to place Robby in a residential center, where he can live full-time and get the training that he needs. [dramatic country music] Agreed, Ken? - I know it's not what we wanted, but it's what we got. I found a good place for him that will train him, get him a job. - No way. - And he can come home on weekends. - No way. We as a family don't fight that judge on this, I don't know who I am. I don't know what my time on Earth was for. - We'd be giving up on him, saying we don't love him. - Nobody's saying that. - Well, that's what it feels like! - There's no point in fighting this if we can't win. [sentimental country music] - [Rose] Why'd you take off like that? - [Robby] Well, I couldn't sleep. - [Rose] Oh, me neither. - [Robby] My dad always said, no institution. Never, never, die first. - At least they'll let me visit ya. I'm sure they will. We've still got two more weeks. We could aways run away again. - You're my home, Rose. ♪ Home, home on the range ♪ Where the deer and the antelope ♪ Play ♪ Where seldom is heard ♪ A discouraging word ♪ And the skies are not cloudy ♪ All day [sentimental country music] [people socializing] - [Rose] Robby, you don't have to buy me nothing. - But I want to, Rose. Something to keep, so you'll see it and remember me. - [Rose] [chuckles] Robby. - No, I do! - How about remembrance rings? Got some beauties here on special. You wear one. She wears one. - Oh, just like we're married. - Same idea, only better. - [Rose] What are you doing? - Now, we have our rings on. Rose Parks, I love you. - And I love you. - Let's get married. - Oh, honey, wouldn't that be wonderful? - I love you. Do you love me? Let's get married. - Oh, don't you know I want to? What do you think those people at that residential center would say if you was married. - Rose Parks, I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you, love you, love you, love you-- - All right, all right. [laughs] We do have a right to a little piece of our happiness, don't we? - We gonna get married. - Yes, we are. I do love you. [both smooching] [horn honks] [Rose giggles] - Well, if this is a democracy and anybody can vote, I vote against it. I mean, I got some mental problems like Robby. And I used to drink a lot, like Robby, too. And I think Rose should marry me. [all laughing] - Well, it does bring up a point. - What? You mean like why I want to marry somebody with problems? Well... Robby is the first lover who has always been good to me, and because he loves me. And because it's just his way with people. He's good and gentle, and... He's on my side, forever. And because I just love him, that's all. - Aw, bless your heart, honey. - You all know I had a lot of different jobs. One of them is I'm a minister. [all laughing] No, serious, I got a license and everything! [sentimental country music] Do you, Rose, take this man, Robert, to be your wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poor, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish till death do you part? - I do. - [Scott] And do you, Robert, take this woman-- - I do. I promise my wife, Rose Smith, to love her, like her, take care of her, everything, richer, poorer, sickness, health, always, never no one else. Me and Rose, forever and ever. Amen. - That says it all. You man and wife! [audience applauding] - I love you, oh. - That's all I had was Nina's birthday party paper. - I helped choose it! - [Rose] I don't get it. It's an empty room. - [Nina] That's your new place! - We all chipped in together, Dr. Roche and all of us and your family and everybody. - Yeah, yeah, we got enough for the deposit and the first month's rent. Well, there ain't anything in it but a mattress so far. - What else do you need the first year? [all laughing] - Charlie, you are terrible! [door bangs] - [Rose] Woop! [yelps] [both laughing] - You're all mine. - That's right, too. [both laughing] [both smooching] [phone ringing] - I'll get it. [family socializing] Hello? - Who is it? - It's the residential center. What do you mean, you can't take him now? He's what? - Ken? - The hell he is! - What, what? - What, what? - She's gone and made him marry her. She's not gonna get away with this. - Oh, honey, I'm sorry this has to be today, but they called me back about that check-out job, and I sure could use the money. - Well, I could work there, too, Rose. - Yeah, sure. If they hire me, later on we'll ask them about a job for you, okay? - Okay. - Oh, and when I get back, we'll call your folks and let 'em know we're married. - Yeah, let them know we're married. Kenny'll change when he knows we're married, Rose. - Yeah, well, I guess it don't hurt to hope, huh? Mm. I'll be back as fast as I can. - Okay. Bye, honey. - Bye, wish me luck! - Bye, good luck! [siren wailing] Kenny, well... Kenny, that's Rose's. Kenny, why are you taking my stuff? - You're gonna come visit for a while. - But Kenny, I can't visit you. We just got married. Kenny? Kenny, let's wait. Rose will be here soon. Let's talk. - I'm your guardian, Robby, not Rose Parks! - Rose Smith, Kenny! She's my wife, Kenny! Well, Kenny, I... [dramatic country music] Rose! - Wait! - Rose! Kenny, please, don't! - Let me explain! - [Robby] No, Kenny, please, wait a minute! [engine roars] [all shouting] - Robby, Robby! You bastard! Who the hell do you think you are? You're not gonna get away with this! [sobs] You can't do this! [sobs] - Are you gonna sleep in my top bunk again tonight, uncle Robby? - I don't know. I guess. - Why, Robby, why? - And I don't wanna hear any more about it. You give me one solid real reason why she would marry him. - Kenny, could I talk to Jake? - The residential center won't take him now because he's, quote, married, and you knew that and so did she. But it doesn't matter anyway anymore because I have the authority to direct every aspect of his life, including his legal representation, and you're fired. If you try to contact him, I'm gonna have you charged with illegal soliciting. So back off, fella. You back off. [phone clatters] - Kenny, did you fire Jake? I wanted to talk to him. I wanted to ask him to say hi to Rose. Kenny? Kenny. Kenny, why did you have to fire Jake? - Come on, Robby. You and I got a little bit to deal with-- - But I wanted to talk to him, Kenny. - Can I have a word with you? - A word? I kind of got a lot to deal with right now, sweetheart. - Kenny? - Well, I wonder why. - Why did you, I wanted-- - Robby, listen to me. I want you to write a letter to that judge. - But Kenny-- - Okay? Now, come on. Sit down right here. You got got a pen and paper. - [Robby] I wanna see Rose, Kenny? - This has gotta get done, Robby. This is important. - [Robby] Well, what do I say? - [Ken] Say you want to live with me. - But I want to live with Rose! - Now, come on. I'll dictate and you write, okay, Robby? - Kenny, I wanna live with Rose. - That's an impossibility. - But I want Rose! - Don't get nervous. - I love her! - [Ken] How 'bout a beer? - Rose and Dr. Roche said beer-- - I've been drinking with you half my life. You never had a problem. - I need Rose. - Start writing, "Dear Judge." - I need Rose! - You need Rose like you need a hole in the head. You've got the wrong idea about her. She's not waiting around for you. - No! - Now, write. "I do not want Mr. Hobart to help me anymore." - Kenny, she's my wife! - [Ken] "I do not want." - She has her ring on, Kenny. - Oh, the hell, she does. She doesn't give two hoots about you. - Oh, Kenny, no. - She's laughing at all of us behind our backs. - No, Kenny, she's not. Rose is not laughing. - Robby, I heard she left town. Now, you gotta forget her. She's gone, Robby. She's gone. [dramatic country music] Now, come on, Robby. Let's do the letter. - Kenny, I-- - "I am very happy "living here." - Kenny, I-- - "I am very happy "living--" - No, no, it's lies! It's lies! It's lies! - Robby! - It's lies! It's lies! - Robby, Robby! - Rose is my wife! - Hang on! - She loves me! - Robby! [both shouting] - Don't talk about her! - Okay! - Don't talk about her! - Okay! - Don't talk about her! - Okay! [Robby weeping] Easy, buddy. Easy, okay? Just calm down, please. Just take it easy. Come on back in. [Robby yelps] [Robby sobbing] - Okay, okay, Robby. Robby, you win. Let's go back in and watch some football or something. - Don't talk about her. Ever. Ever. - Fine, fine. [gravel crunching] - Well, you know I like Robby. I can see he's good for you. But if this fight goes on long, it could turn Robby's own family against him. And then what happens if you lose? He'd have nobody. - I know. It scares me. - Well, I've got another question for you. What happens if you win? You'd have to take care of Robby all alone, your whole life. - [sighs] If I give up on him, I'm going back on everything I promised him when we got married. And I promised myself, too, that this time, I wouldn't give up. This time, I would fight. - I know how you feel. But I'll tell you straight. I think it'd be better for both you and Robby if you just let his family have him. They love him, don't they? [sentimental country music] [truck honks] [phone beeping] [phone ringing] - Hello? - [Operator] I have a collect call for Mrs. Rose Smith from Mr. Robby Smith. Will you accept the charges? - [Robby] Hi, Rose, it's me! It's me! - Oh, yes, yes, Robby? Robby, where are you? - I sneaked out to call you. I wrote you two letters. Did you get them, Rose? - Oh, yes, honey. I read 'em about 50 times already. - I love you, Mrs. Smith. I keep telling Kenny, too, but he says a lot. I told him, stop. - Honey, where are you? Are you locked up in that home? - No, no, don't worry, Rose, Kenny's house. But, oh, I miss you. You are so beautiful, Rose Smith. I want my life with you. - Oh, sweetheart, they ain't never gonna let you go free 'til I just go away. - Don't! Don't say go away. Don't say that. - I don't want to, ever. Maybe they'll just forget all this institution stuff and let you go back home if I just get away. - We have a home! Is our apartment still there? - [sniffs] Sure is. - [Robby] Is Paco there? - Yeah, he's looking over here. He knows it's you. [sentimental country music] - I have my ring on. Do you have your ring on? - Yeah, I surely do. - I'm your husband. Are you my wife? For me and only me? - I'll always be your wife, for you and only you. And if anybody ever tries to tell you different, you'd never believe them Siberian sons of biscuit-eaters, okay? - Rose Smith, Mrs. Rose Smith... I love you. I lie down with you. I put my arms around you. You put your arms around me. Are you holding me? - Yes, Robby, I'm holding you. - Don't let go. - Never. [lively carnival music] - Hi there. - Hi. [children laughing] [people socializing] [people clapping] [lively bluegrass music] - Now, isn't this fun? Look this way, Robby. Smile. [camera clicks] Robby, why can't you look over here? - So many people, Mom. Maybe Rose is-- - She ain't gonna show up here, son. - I miss her, Dad. - Robby. - I love her, Mom. I need her. I need to be with her. - I know, Robby, but you gotta get over it. - [Robby] Well, I-- - [Ken] Robby. - Ken, I need to talk to you. - Hey, Judge. - Hello, folks. - Morning, Judge. - Robby, how are ya? - Fine. - Listen, I got a call from Jake Hobart last night, who said that Robby never showed up to that appointment. - Judge, I can't make him go if he don't wanna go. - Don't give me that. Ken, your attorney has two court orders that I signed that Robby is to meet with Hobart. - I fired Hobart. - Well, you can't. - I'm Robby's legal guardian. - Yeah, you are because I say you are, but I can take that back. Now, your brother has a right to an attorney who represents him and not you. You can't get rid of Hobart unless you can prove he's either crooked or incompetent. Now, can you prove that? - If I had the time. - No, you can't. He's just a burr up your butt. Well, that ain't nothing compared to what I'm gonna be if you don't get your brother over to his attorney's office first thing Monday morning. You got that? [lively carnival music] [people socializing] [phone ringing] - Robby, just wait here while I check things out, okay? [typewriter clacking] - Jake. - Hobart, you've got no right having that woman here. This meeting's off. - Now, I've got a court order that tells me different. - Yeah? - Now, where's Robby? - [Reporter] Robby? Are you Robby? - Uh-huh. - Hi, Robby, how are ya? Is Jake here yet? - I-- - Come on, let's go inside. - My brother Kenny said-- - Yeah, that's fine. Don't worry about it. - I'm supposed to sit here. - [Jake] It's got nothing to do with conditions. - [Ken] Let's call the judge right now and ask him, huh? - Just hold it. Hold it. Excuse me, are you from The Eagle? - Yeah, can we start interviews now? - Great, yeah. - Yeah. - [Jake] Hi, Robby, how are ya? - [Reporter] Do you want to do 'em in the office or not? - [Jake] Yeah, that'd be fine. - Are you Rose? - You're really sick, pal. - Yes, I am. - [Ken] What the hell do think you're doing? - Robby? - Rose! - Robby? - [Robby] Oh, Rosy, Rosy, Rosy, Rosy, Rosy! [sobs] Oh, Rosy. - Maybe we should just hold off. - My Rosy, baby. Oh, my brother hit me so much. Oh, Rosy. I miss my girl. I miss my girl. - I'll be back in one hour. - Kenny, I am not going with you. I stay with Rose. - Robby, the judge is not gonna let you-- - Not him, not you! Me and Rose, married! Married forever, forever! That's it, final! ♪ Without your sweet love ♪ What would life be ♪ So never leave me lonely ♪ Tell me you love me only ♪ And that you'll always - Oh, the judge was livid when he saw the papers. Trying the case in the media, shabby efforts, all that stuff, but by God, it worked. We've got a hearing six weeks from now. - Oh, I guess that'll be our big chance. - [Robby] Yeah. - But you know, everything hinges on whether or not the judge accepts the marriage. And he is going to need something from us as well. [siren wailing] - He keeps on thinking Ken's gonna come back and grab him. - Well, the judge, of course, you two aren't gonna like this, but, well, it might save you. - Spit it out, Jake. - The judge wants Robby to be tested and evaluated thoroughly before the hearing. - What kind of tests? - [Robby] What kind of tests? - Intelligence tests, psychological tests. They'll be watching how he relates to other people. He'll try him out on different jobs. The social workers and psychiatrists who test you, they will be determining whether you can, you really could live independently, whether you really understand what marriage is and whether you can commit to it. - Well, I sure can, Jake. I do. Where are these tests? - Well, the center's right here. It's in Wichita, and they could take you now, I mean, today. But the problem is the testing process occurs over 30 days, and they insist that you live at the institute where-- - Oh, institution, no way. - No, we just got back together, Jake. - No, not one day, no way, Jake. - Robby, please. - Rose, I... I won't go in. - Okay, okay. [Robby moaning] - I don't wanna go. - Hey, Robby, look. - Please, I don't wanna go. - Look, they can't make you go inside. - I don't wanna go in. - If you don't wanna go-- - No, no die first. - It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. - Rose, you help me. Rose, I don't wanna do this. - They've got a court order. They can force him. You've gotta help me here. - Look, I'm not gonna coerce him. He's terrified. How should he trust them to let him out of here? - His future's in the judge's hands. He's gonna try and show his best side. - Why don't you let me handle this? [Robby whimpering] Robby, my name is Eddy. - [yelps] I don't wanna go. I don't, no, no. - Why don't you come with me? - No, no. - No, he doesn't wanna go. - Ma'am, it's gonna be all right. - I don't wanna go. - No. - Come on, Robby. - No, no. - Okay, fellas? [Robby moaning] - Robby, it's okay. Hey, he doesn't wanna go! [Robby shouting] [all shouting] Hey, he doesn't wanna go! [car slams] Robby, Robby! [dramatic country music] [buzzer buzzes] - My daughter's coming to take me home today. She's coming at 12 o'clock, so I have to be ready. She's coming at one o'clock. Can I have my coat? [man grunting] - Dirty, smelly, disgusting, swallowing swine, bitch. - [Nurse] Now, what are you doing in the hospital? [patients babbling] - Here's your medication, Robby. - Robby, talk to me a little. - Rose. - It'll calm you down. - Rose. - Tell me about her. - Come on. Drink up. - I can't help you if you won't communicate with me. - Robby, I'm Karen, attorney. The judges appointed me as your new guardian. - I want Rose. - [Karen] They had to put you in a locked ward, Robby, you were in such bad shape. But if you can use this time to rest and calm yourself, prepare yourself for the evaluation, they'll let you off this ward in no time. - No, I need Rose. - Listen, the judge got Ken to resign as your guardian. That's a big step. - I want Rose, please. - She's not allowed to visit. We're afraid you'll get all upset again. You just forget about her for a while, and concentrate on getting well. [patients babbling] - I can't let you in, sorry, not unless your name is on the list. - Well, how in the hell do I get on that list? [people socializing] Excuse me, Judge. I'm Rose Parks, Rose Smith, Robby Smith's wife. - All right, all right, now, look. I've gotta be back in court here pretty quick, but, well, walk along. Talk to me. - He's in a real bad way, judge. - Yeah, I know. I know. I feel, you know, I'm very concerned, believe me. This whole family conflict has been hell on him. - He'd get better right away if you'd just let him out of there and let me take care of him. - Why didn't you come to the hearing? - Judges and courts, they just been a lot of heartache to me. - Yeah, do you see your children? - They live pretty far away, but we talk. - Ah, good, that's good. - Judge, I know Robby can pass any test you got. But right now, he is so shook up 'cause we've been forced to part again. And if he thinks I'm gone for good, he ain't never gonna get better. - You really think you're that important to him? - I know I am, just like he is to me. Maybe you ain't married, but-- - No, no, I am. I am. - If your wife were locked up-- - Right, uh, right. - But if you'd just let me see him, even once, he'd know I'm here waiting for him, and he'd get better. He'd pass that test. That's what it's gonna take. - Congratulations, but you can't take that bird in there. - You wanna call the judge? [buzzer buzzes] [Paco squawks] [people socializing] [Paco squawking] - I thought you were never coming. - Oh, sweetheart, I've been trying. I've been trying. - [Robby] Take me home. - I can't, not yet. - I'll die here. - No, no, you won't. - I say, "Rose," and they say, "Forget her." - Then listen, honey. Just don't mention my name, okay? Do whatever they say, just so they'll let you out of here. - They'll never let me out. - Yes, they will. The judge says so, but you've gotta do it. - Do what, Rose? - Get strong again. Listen, you gotta look at it like, like being a patient is your job now. They're the bosses. Them doctors and nurses, if they say, "Jump," you say, "How high?" Because if you fight 'em, honey, they ain't never gonna let us be free. - You'll come every day? - I can't. The judge just gave me this one time. But hey, look. Who's here? - Hi, Paco. [Paco squawks] - [chuckles] And he's gonna stay with you. The judge says Paco stays 'til you're off this ward. - That's right, too. - And I'll call you every day. Oh, and look. I brung you your calendar, so you can mark off the days 'til you come home. [sentimental country music] - Home. - But you gotta take hold, honey. Will you do that? Come on. They say, "Jump," you say? - How high, boss? - And you mark the days. - 'Til I come home. - Oh. [buzzer buzzes] - Nurse Menta. [buzzer buzzes] Good luck, Robby. Mr. Gordon? - Hey, Robby, it's good to see you again. I'm Eddy. I'm part of the team that's gonna be helping you through this process. - The tests? - Well, don't think of 'em as tests. [chuckles] We're just trying to see what kind of help you need to live your life. - I need Rose to help me. - Well, you'll be able to see her when this is over. Just be yourself. It'll be no big deal. - I see you took special classes at the high school. Did you graduate from high school, Robby? - I can't remember if I graduated. - What were your favorite subjects? - Oh, talk to people, kids and girls. - And what have you been doing since high school, Robby, hm? Well, have you worked or? - Got married. Mrs. Rose Smith, my wife. - What does that mean, Robby, hm, being married? - Married? - Yeah, what's special or different about being married? - Well, Rose, me and Rose, we have a bird, Paco, apartment, cook, eat, clean up, sleep, watch TV. I bring her a pop. She brings me a pop. Like her, love her, everything. - And do you have intercourse? Do you know what sexual intercourse is, Robby? - I sure don't, no. - Well, do you and your wife have sex? Do you make love? - Both, all the time. - Good. [chuckles] Now, I'm gonna give you a few short tests-- - I really miss Rose. - To evaluate your math and memory skills. - I think about her all the time, holding, everything. - Did you hear me, Robby? A few short tests. - I don't do so good on tests. I need Rose. [people socializing] - Everybody, this is Robby. - [Group] Hi, Robby. - He's gonna be working with us for a while. - Come on over here, Robby. - Hey, Connie. We'll just move you over here for a second. Okay, now the first job you're gonna learn is the job that Adam does. - It's easy, see? [hole-punch clanks] - Okay, now, these are sheet protectors for notebooks. Just punch the holes along one side, and then later, we'll put 'em in the notebooks. Think you wanna try that? - You can do it. [dramatic country music] Just try it once. It's fun. - I could be your coach, Robby. I like coaching. - Ah, I'm not doing it! I'm not retarded! I'm not retarded! I'm not retarded! [upbeat country music] Yeah, they took us out skating. - [Rose] Well, that's good, honey. Are you getting along with everyone? - I'm not like those kids. - Robby, you gotta do it. - Well, I can't do it, Rose. They said I'm not helping, but I can't. I'm sorry. - Honey, I ain't blaming you, but if this don't work out, they ain't never gonna let us be who we are together. What'll we do? - I don't know, Rose. - I guess all we can do is get in the car and go. - [Robby] You mean run away again? Okay. - Where are ya? - The big ice rink by the highway. - Well, I'll just throw some stuff in the car and meet you outside at six, okay? Look for me in the parking lot. - I gotta go. - Hey, what's up, Robby? - Oh, nothing much. Nice place. - Eh? So how about trying on a pair of skates? - Oh, I-- - You might like it once you get the hang of it. - I walk, watch, everything. - Suit yourself. [Paco squawks] [mellow country music] [people socializing] [engine rumbling] - Robby, where are you? Shoot, shoot, shoot. - [Eddy] Hey, Connie, can you skate like that? - Yes. - Huh? Let's see it. Come on. There you go. [laughs] Take care of her, Adam. [Paco squawks] Good, there you go. - Hey, Eddy. Hey, you should go over there and watch her skate. She's really good. - Yeah, she's great, isn't she? - Yeah. - I gotta hang out here. Adam and Connie sometimes have problems, you know? - Oh, I'll hang out here. Yeah, no problem. - Okay, it's a deal. Thanks, Robby. - Okay, Eddy. - [Eddy] Hey, guys. [kids socializing] - [Boy Wearing Cap] Whoa, whoa, check this out. Look. - What is it? - [Boy Wearing Cap] I can't believe it. - [Boy in White Sweatshirt] Oh, man, that's too gross. Don't. - They're like pets, huh? Look. [laughs] Look at that. Here, kitty, kitty. [boys giggling and meowing] [boys laughing] - Hey, you know. - Come on. What a bunch of retards. [laughs] [dramatic country music] Whoa! [boys laughing] - What is this? Oh, big daddy, big daddy, protecting the innocent. Whoa, big daddy's a geek, too. [boys laughing] [inspirational country music] What idiots, yeah, bunch of losers. So long, losers. [laughs] [mellow country music] - Robby. That was the toughest test, and you did great. - Rose... Maybe I could stay, try to pass the tests. - Good, that would be great 'cause I'm so tired of running. - Me too, Rose. So, if I try, [sentimental country music] will you wait for me? - Don't you never let anybody tell you different. - No, I just-- - It's okay. What's Dad gonna do if the judge rules against us? Dad? I'll ride along with you and Mom if you like. - [Jim] Do what you want. - Well, I've gone over this evaluation many times. Now, Robby, it seems like you got off on the wrong foot and stayed there for quite awhile. - I sure did, Judge, but after that, I worked hard. - Well, that's what they say here, too. Overall, this is a very good evaluation. - That's right, too. - But the group home might still be the best place for Robby. It's neutral ground where his wife and his family can visit him without having to deal with each other. Because for Robby to make progress, he has to live in peace. So I want to know right now if you folks are gonna accept this marriage and this woman. 'Cause if you're gonna keep fighting it, it's gonna tear this boy apart, and I won't be a part of that. What'll it be? [dramatic country music] - You must have done all right by him if he passed them tests. So, I guess I can let it go if you can. - Then I'm gonna rule that Robby and Rose are legally married and can live together. Good luck, folks. - Robby, it's all over now, huh, buddy? - You gave us a bad time. - Only 'cause I loved you. - Yeah? Okay. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. See ya. - Can you come to lunch sometime? I mean both of you. - Sure. - Let's go home, Rose Smith. [sentimental country music] [contemplative country music]
