Come on, let's go. Come on! -Let me go! -Calm down! ON THE RUN A FILM BY VIRGINIE GOURMEL -OK boys? -Yeah. Let her go, she'll be calm. MP3 player. And these lovely stones? Souvenirs? Sorry, gorgeous, you can't keep them. You will get them when you come out. I also need your cellphone. -Why? -It is the rule here. No cellphones. How will I call without a cellphone? When you want to call, you ask me, and I give you a phone. Fuck, it is worse than jail here! You don't know about jail. So keep it down, OK? -Where is your cellphone? -In my pocket. Can I have it? It is an iPhone XS. Give it back! It cost 400 euros. Here is your room, princess. This is Carole. You will share this room with her and Nabila. You will see, they are very nice. Carole? Say hello to your new roommate? We will let you settle down. You have closet number 2. We come and get you for dinner. Don't eat the whole packet at once. We should tell her grandma to stop sending her junk. -Are you the new girl? -Yeah. -What is your name? -Kathy. -Like Kathy Perry? -Yeah. I am Nabila. -Do you snore? -Sorry? Hear that, fatso? Apparently, new girl is a rich kid. Do you snore? Listen, I warn you. If you snore, I kick you out of my room. -Can I sit here? -Yeah. They are bad girls. Don't hang out with them. They are crazy. Do you see the redhead? She drinks her own piss. Stay away when she has a fit. Sorry. For you, wooden cutlery. Dessert! I am not taking that. I am not crazy. I don't decide if you take them, the doctor does. If you are not happy, speak to him. I said I am not taking them. Stop being difficult. Either you take your meds nicely, or we will have to force you. I won't take that shit, I said! Stop it! You are angry at being locked up, but the judge decided to protect you and others. Plus, it is temporary. Once your situation has improved, your life will go back to normal. A foster family? Is that normal? I know your family situation is not easy, but we are here to help, Kathy. OK? But you need to make an effort. You need to take your meds, or you will never get cured. The meds are just there to help you calm down. If you don't take them, the psychiatrist will force you. Then he will up the dose. You risk being out of it most of the time. I would like to make a deal. You calm down... and I ask the psychiatrist to lower your daily dose. However, I need to be able to trust you. Kathy. Can I trust you? I am in a meeting now. Let me see. Tuesday is not possible. However, Wednesday...? Yeah, Wednesday, 4:00 p.m. OK. Bye. Come on, Kathy! That is enough. Take off the towel. What is going on now? -I don't wanna swim. -Swimming is not an option. You have to go in. It will be good for you. You feel really tense. Let go! I don't wanna swim. -Your friends are in the water. -They are not even my friends! Come on, Kathy. Are you deaf or what? I don't wanna swim! Enough of the new girl being a pain in the ass. Come on! Kathy! Kathy! Quick! Do something! OK, OK... OK, it is fine. Yeah, sure. Stop messing around. It is urgent. It is chaos in here. Yes, hello, Director. It is Marjorie. I am calling because I had some trouble with the new girl at the pool. Fuck. Come on, fatso, move. What are you doing? Hurry up! Come on, hurry up! -We are gonna be in trouble! -Fuck it. Come on! Too bad for you. I am off. What are you doing? Can you start a car? It's the red and the blue. -Can you drive? -Get out. I helped you, and now you wanna get rid of me? I am gonna see my dad. I don't give a fuck. I am staying. Come on, drive. -Where are you going? -To Disneyland! -Hop in! -No, she is not coming! Fucking drive! Drive or I tell Marjo you stole her bag and you are in a blue 306. Look at what Nabila stole. Yummy. Here. You don't know what's good. Could you not have checked the gas level before we left? -Give me the 50 euros. -It is not your cash. -It is not yours either. -It is, I stole it. Where will we go with no gas? I give you the 50 euros, but let's not go see your padre straight away. Let's go shopping first. I haven't been to Zara and HandM for so long. If we stop off now, they will find us. I don't care. I just wanna go shopping. It is obvious you don't have your license. These ones? Those ones? Are you coming? Did you forget we just stole a car? I pay with card. -Hey, cutie, what is your name? -Kevin. If I had had the time, I would have slept with you. I bet you have a big one. Come on, let's eat! Give me the smarties. It feels so good... to eat real food. Where does your padre live? What? Where is that? In Luxembourg. You see? I told you she was a rich kid. Why do you wanna see him? You are being mysterious. You scared I find out your secrets? Why did you get locked up? You don't look like a junkie or a schizo. Do you not like your body? Are you anorexic? Are you depressed? Do your parents not love you? Were you not planned? Or did your uncle play with your--? Shut the fuck up! You can't control your emotions. You should up your dose, honey. Shut up. I am cold. Can't you put the heating on? Take this, it will calm you down. Don't stretch it out, OK? It is Ralph Lauren. Those meds get you so high. I am wasted. We are here. We are here! Holy fuck. What is this shit parking lot? You go. I wait here. No, you are not going with my 50 bucks' worth of gas. We are staying with you. Right, fatso? Plus, I have never been to Luxembourg. -Have you been? -Yeah, it is so-so. Then, we will go to the sea. I know many clubs there, the Cherry Moon... I am not going to the sea. You are such a party-pooper! I see why your mom got you locked up, you are such a pain! Let's go shopping. Hey, look! How long has it been since I went to a shopping mall? A year maybe? I really wanna buy perfume. Look at how ugly that is! Look at the dress. -Who would wear that? -Not me. And they sell different models. Alright. So pretty with all the colors. Do you want an ice-cream? So, vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. Actually... No, not vanilla. Cookies. Can I have four, Nab? Well, yeah. So, two scoops of cookies. Please, could I have Nutella instead of chocolate and raspberry instead of coffee? Could I also have chocolate and crème fraîche in a chocolate cone? Stop, everyone is looking. -Enough. Let's go back to the car. -Yeah, alright. She just needs to refresh. Are you feeling better? -Daddy panda! -Lush! I should never have let you come with me. Relax, rich kid. Stop stressing out. Stores won't report a teddy bear made in China. They report bigger thefts, or you get caught. What do you know? Are you a cop? No. I am the queen of thieves! I have been stealing stuff since I could walk. Fuck, actually, my padre, the first time he picked me up from the cops, I was five. Respect. He still beat me up, asshole, but I carried on. No one catches me. The voices tell me if it is risky. Does your padre live far? I still don't get why you wanna see him. He has to get me out of hospital. Why? Did your mom send you to the madhouse? -I am not crazy. -You are not crazy? Fatso, hear that? Apparently, rich kid is not crazy. Of course, you are crazy! You are our sister. You are crazy, for sure, but I am not. You are crazy, loser! If your madre got you locked up and the fucking judge accepted it, you are as loopy as the rest. Your daddy won't save you from the madhouse. -This is not Frozen! -Shut the fuck up! You will pay! Let her go! Fuck, my head... Wait... I am bleeding! I am bleeding! Stop screaming. You are fine. I can't believe it! -Are you OK, ladies? -Yeah, sir. -What happened? -I don't know. The car stalled while we were driving. The engine must have broken down. It is my mom's car. It is old. Come. Don't stay there. I am taking you to the hospital. Come. Don't you want me to drop you off at the hospital? No, thank you. My dad is a doctor. He will look after my friend. Plus, it is not serious. A Band-Aid and it is sorted. The eyebrow arch always bleeds a lot, but it is not serious. And your friend, with the bandage, she doesn't look very well. She got a stomach bug at the pool. That is why she is pale. How old are you? You are a bit young to drive. I am 17. I have had a provisional license for 10 months. You can't drop us off here. We are ten minutes away. Hey, missy! Your car can't stay there. Don't you want me to call a mechanic? No, thanks, it will be fine. We will get it later. Carole! Hey, fatso! Are you deaf or what? Come out. Carole. I peed. -Oh my God. -Are you serious? She didn't pee on the seat? -Come on. -But I peed! Come, it is fine. Wait a minute! Unbelievable! Oh, shit! Ladies! Ladies! Did you see the man's face? "What? She didn't pee on the seat?" "She did, sucker! Ha! "She fucked up your car!" I love you, fatso. You are the best fatso in the world. Hey, Kathy! Do you know where you are going? To my dad's. My feet hurt. I wanna go home. I want my bedroom. Fuck, it is a homeless camp! Come on, girls, let's go! -Good evening. -Hi. We are lost. How do we get out of here? It depends on where you are going. -To Luxembourg. -By foot? Yeah. Or by hitchhiking if we can find a road. You cross the forest until Gouvy. There is the main road, but it is a three-hour walk. Three hours? We are not walking for another three hours! I have had enough. I am tired. It smells of weed. Are you smoking joints? Do you want some? It is good. How about I get some weed in exchange for some pills. I have at least 50. No, Nab. Stop, Nab. No. Let me sit there. Shall we make up? Friends now? Don't ignore me. Friends. What is Carole doing with that guy? I was the matchmaker. Fatso is still a virgin, so she can't wait. So, I set it all up. I am not a good friend. I am the best. Give me the joint. Is it true about the voices you heard? Do you still hear them? Only when I am starving, or I don't have my pills. -What do they tell you? -Do you really wanna know? He has soft hands. And he kisses like a god. He said he would teach me how to play the hang. Don't get carried away. He is just a good fuck. It is not like you slept with Drake. I would like to stay here. That is not possible. If I behave for a few months, maybe they will let me leave, and I will come back and live here with Paulo. Are you not going back to your parents'? Rather die than go back. At my grandma's at a push... but to theirs, never. PSYCHIATRIST DUPERELLE Why are you crying? He didn't even say goodbye. Fuck, girl, wake up! He doesn't care about you! He just fucked you! All guys are like that. So, stop acting like Cinderella. Fuck, they stole all my pills! I told you not to hang out with those douchebags! There were 200 bucks' worth. I am so fucking sad. NO ACCESS PRIVATE PROPERTY I have had enough. The water is so cold! Why don't you get in? I have no swimming costume! Who cares? You can swim naked in here. There is no one. -It is cold! -It is good. It hardens the nipples. Don't drown, OK? Don't do your pool trick again! I am not doing mouth-to-mouth. You don't mind being naked like that? Not at all. Having the wind in my pussy feels good. At home, I could never go around naked. Even in the shower, you had to wear panties. Worse than jail. My brothers were a pain in the ass. How many brothers do you have? Six. Well, five, now. One died. -Rich kid, how many siblings? -I don't have any. Shall we? Let's go. Still a long way to go. Can you take us to Luxembourg? Come on, girls! -Can we put the radio on? -Yeah. -Put on the radio, please? -What? Yeah. Can you slow down? I am feeling sick. What got over him? Luxembourg was on the left! Calm down! This is not Formula 1! A drugstore! Stop! Can you not stop normally? Loser. Open! Fuck. Open or I break everything! It is useless. There is no one. I can't believe it. Fuck. -What am I gonna do? -Stop, Nab. It is useless. It is closed. Don't you see I am being torn inside? I am in pain. I can't cope. If I don't take anything, I am gonna die. What am I gonna do? We will find you something. The emergency drugstore. OK? Come on, come. You had better find me a drugstore. Thanks, man. Hey! Where is my drugstore? -You smoked. It is fine, right? -No, it is not fine! That joint lasted two minutes. Hell, I need my pills! Calm down. My dad will give you something. You and your fucking dad! I want a drugstore, not your fucking dad! Do you get it? He is a doctor. He will give you a tranquilizer. He is just a bastard who abandoned you, who you haven't seen for years. You are not even on the family photo, loser! -Give it back! -You want it, eh? Give it! Have your photos. You don't have a dad, it is just lies. Stop taking us for fools. Don't you think we realized you are suicidal? You are asking us for help, right? So that daddy takes you in with his fucking rich family? So he saves you from your evil mom, right? My mom is dead, bitch! -Why did you do that? -Shut the fuck up. Antoine, open. It is me, Kathy. Kathy? Kathy, are you there? Hey, fatso! Did you break the window? Look for something to make a bandage. Anything. Some fabric, curtain... Whatever you want. Fuck, Kathy, what did you do? You are just hurting yourself by doing that. People don't care. Even your dad doesn't care. Anyway, he won't even know. Come on, come here. Cry if you need to. It feels good, sometimes. My mom used to tell me that. She cried so much in her shitty life... I am sorry about your mom. I didn't know. Do you forgive me? It will be fine. Don't worry. What are you doing? Hide. He gets here in two minutes. Kathy, come back! Stop! Kathy! Ask for something to eat! Good evening. I am looking for Antoine Duperelle. Where does he live? He is an old friend of my mom's. She is in intensive care. She is very sick. She has cancer. I thought he should know. Poor sweetie. I am sorry. Antoine lives three km away, in Waregem. It is a big villa. Number 2, I think. -You know where it is? -Did they move long ago? Four or five months ago, I think. They are expecting a baby, so, they need a bigger house. Shall I drive you there? No, thanks. I am in a car with my mom's friend. -Goodbye! -Goodbye. Go and see him. Ask for my pills. And food! What, rich kid? He is the only one who can get you out of the madhouse? What is the matter? Go and see him. What are you doing? Good evening. -What do you want? -I wanna see my dad. My dad, Antoine, is he here? -Who do you want? -Is Antoine Duperelle here? Is it a joke? No, thanks. Fucking crazy woman! -Where is Antoine? -He went out. Lie down or I will stab you! You say you are Antoine's daughter, but it is not possible. Lie down, you whore! Tie her up, quick! Let me go! What am I looking for? I won't be able to hold it! She is shouting! Hurry up! -Her baby! -Doesn't matter, hurry up! Mom? Fuck, there is a kid! Stop moving or I will stab your kid, OK? -Where is my mom? -She had to leave. Your dad asked me to babysit you. -Who are you? -I am Kathy. You are Noah, right? Where is my mom? She had stomach pains, so she went to hospital. But it is nothing serious. They went to do some tests. We will call her in the car. Now, you need to go back to your room, OK? Go and get dressed. We will go and see them in hospital later. Carole, go with him to get some clothes. And toiletries. -Why me? -Do as I say! What are you doing? Kidnapping? You are a wildcard. We need to find bags for food and clothes. Like a travel bag. -What do we do with her? -Leave her. The fat girl is mean and scary. Stay with me, then. Nabila, Carole, hurry up! Get in the car. I want my teddy. Fat girl took it. I will get it. Get in the car. Nabila, Carole, what are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? We need to go. You going to Cinderella's ball? Stop calling me "fatso". Where is the car? Noah will freak out -if he sees you like that. -I am not getting changed. Had enough of orders. Carole, this is not a game! I am staying like this or I am not coming. Calm down, Cinderella. Rich kid is right. If you come out like that, we will get caught. You look like a whore. Too much make-up? Hold this. Let me fix it. You put too much blush. Get in with me. Oh, sweets. You look after kids really well, Nab. Here. -What did you give him? -Valium. Just 10 mg. My madre always gave it to me to calm down. Sleep well, Noah, my little brother Sleep well, you will get food Sleep well on my big boobs Relax. I had four little brothers. I know about kids. -Come on, sleep now. -I think he is hungry. Stop, he is not hungry. Give him his teddy. I can't believe it. Did you steal his teddy? Shame! Are you crazy, fatso? Stop calling me "fatso"! I never had a teddy. And I lost the panda. That one stank. -Where are we going? -You will see. You know what you are doing? You have no plans. It sucks. I know where we can go. Fuck, Carole! Is it still far? He is a pain in the ass. I don't know, I can't find it. I haven't been for years. I found it. Actually, your family is fucking gypsies. Shit, no more duvet! Just blankets. And they are scratchy. -Do they have electricity? -Don't turn on anything. Or we will get caught. I am gonna hide the car, OK? If Noah wakes up, no more meds! Tell him I am coming back. She is starting to get on my nerves, always bossing us around! Fuck. Hello? Did you kidnap Noah? Is he OK? Hello? Please, don't hurt him. He is just a kid. He is only five. And me? Don't you think you hurt me? You abandoned me! Now, you will pay for it, asshole! If you promise not to shout, I remove that from your mouth. Nod if you are OK. My hands hurt, I need to pee. I warn you. If you try to run away, you will be in trouble. You won't see your parents again. -Are you done? -I can't do it. Are you kidding me? Stop, you are hurting me. I want my mom and dad. Yeah, me too. Stop it or you will wake up the others. I want my mom and dad. I want my mom and dad. I want my mom and dad. I want my mom and dad. I want my mom and dad. I am exhausted. And if you whine, I won't sleep. Come with me. But promise not to cry. -What will you do to me? -Nothing, sleep. How do you know me? How do you know my name? I know your parents. Now, shut up. I am cold. Now, shut up. Hey, girl! What do you want for breakfast? Valium dessert or Xanax coffee? Your brother fucking stinks of piss! Wash him! And change his boxers. Are we not calling your padre for the ransom? How much would he pay out? Do you have his number? Find it! Your padre is a real doctor! We get a million for sure. No more batteries. Fuck it. If his dad doesn't wanna pay, we can send him one of the kid's fingers. I saw that in movies. It works. After, the parents have to. So, they pay. Wait. You are gonna cut off his finger? With what? With a knife. You are mad. No one touches that kid. Stop scaring her, looking like a gypsy. We are kidding. I thought about the ransom. We should not overdo it. If we ask for too much, it will never work. Even with a kid's finger. How about 300,000? Two hundred and fifty, rather. Wait. So, that is 80,000 each. That is fucking sweet! Eighty bucks to go to Spain. -Could I come with you? -Of course! We will live like queens! We will be like hot babes. We will take pills, clothes... It is gonna be sick. Hey! What does padre mean? It means "dad". So, you are my sister? Are you my sister or not? Your half-sister. So, why have I never seen you? Where do you live? Your dad didn't want me. So why are you mean? Because... Put on those pants and hurry up. -What is your mom called? -None of your business. What is she called? Mireille. But she is dead. She is dead? Go over there. Don't move. If you move or talk, I will tie you back up. You are a crap sister! And you are mean! You deserve your mom to be dead. I will tell dad not to invite you. Shut the fuck up. Why are those guys here? Our guests. They have weed. I called your padre about the ransom. He is OK about the 250,000 bucks. What? Two hundred and fifty thousand euros! When did you call him? With what cellphone? Quiet. I stole Cedric's cellphone. We will exchange tomorrow. Come on, we are off. What was the fat girl doing? -Was she sexing? -Yes. -Does it hurt? -No. So, why was she crying? She was moaning, not crying. -What does it mean? -You are too little to get it. Come on. Hush, be quiet. -Does your mom smoke? -No. It looks like it. Where are we going? My feet hurt. I am hungry and I am sick of walking. Climb on my back. Climb on my back. -You are not gonna drop me? -You are my brother, right? Where are we going? Are we lost? Can I smoke? Please. It is unhealthy. So, why do you smoke? -Because I am stressed. -I am stressed too. It is not nice. I told you it was not nice. Come on, let's go. I don't wanna stay here. Me too. -Climb on my back? -Yeah. Why are you doing that? So they don't find us. Why don't you want them to find us? Stop asking questions! Why are you angry at Dad? Because he is an asshole. He abandoned me. You know you have a good life. A nice house, nice vacations, nice toys. Me, nothing. Apart from a crazy mom high on meds. Is it not sad that your mom is dead? I am so fucking hungry! Fuck, me too. Can I say "fuck"? What would you like to eat right now? Roast chicken with fries and apple sauce. It is my favorite dish. Me too. With crispy skin. Police! Don't move! Show me your hands! Show me your hands! -Where is the kid? -Turn around. Show me your hands! Don't move. -Turn around. -Let me go. Give me your hands! Turn around. Give me your hands. Don't move. Get up! Let me go! Let me go! Where is the kid? -Where is the kid? -Don't touch me! Come here! Let me go! Let me go, asshole! You are hurting me! Get in there! Where is your friend? Kathy, I found some blueberries, there are lots! Why are you laughing? Your blueberries will taste like feet. My feet don't stink. Anyway, if we make a tart, it won't stink of feet. You won't do shit, she is under-age. She will go to a youth detention center. However, you go directly to jail. With your criminal record, the judge will get you. We can send you to jail tonight. No need to go before the judge. Don't say anything. He is bluffing. Or shall we tell your family? Shall we call your dad? Maybe he can make you talk? They say he is very strict. Don't start acting out! She is having a fit. Give me something! We need to put that in her mouth! Carole, it will be fine. Quick, call an ambulance! We need an ambulance! It is a code 2! A kid having a fit. Come. We are hoodlums. I know the guy who has this car. Come, he will help us. Where are your friends? We had a fight. Plus, they were mean and ugly. They only thought about sexing. "Sexing," cool! -Are you not hot like that? -No. -Do you want an ice-cream? -I do. Chocolate. We look like a real family. Dad, mom, and baby. I am not a baby! How come you don't have a wife and kid? I am not quite normal, you know? So, girls don't like it. I am not normal either. Yes, but you are beautiful. I am ugly. Do you have a cellphone? I will be back. Hello? Kathy, is it you? How do you know my name? Did you tell the cops? Yes, but you left me no choice. If you wanna see Noah alive, you need to fix what you did. Get me out of hospital! OK, Kathy. OK. You need to come back with Noah. Can you do that? Is this a trap? I go to yours so the cops catch me? You think I am dumb? No, I just want us to talk. I can help you. I promise I won't call the police. I don't need them now. I know who you are. I don't trust you. You betrayed me. You abandoned us, Mom and I. Why did you not acknowledge me? -Why did you leave? -Please, Kathy, calm down. I don't want to talk about it on the phone. It is too complicated. Come here... Fuck you, asshole! Kathy. I knew your mom well. I treated her for years. What the fuck are you saying? Come here, and I will explain. But you are my fucking dad. Yes or no? Answer! Are you my dad, yes or no? Answer. Are you my dad? Kathy, you need to sleep. Go back to bed. -Let go. -No, Kathy, calm down. Let go! -Calm down! -Let go! Why are you not my dad? I treated your mom over ten years ago. She was in hospital after an overdose. I continued seeing her in consultations. Sometimes you came with her. You must have been about two. I don't know what she told you, Kathy, but I... I am not your dad. I am sorry. Kathy. I will call the director of your institution. OK? I know you are angry. This anger is aimed at me, but you mustn't do anything stupid. Look at me, Kathy. OK? Here. Sleeping pills. They will help you calm down and sleep. If you don't sleep, with all the blood you lost, you risk fainting again. Here. Come on. Great. I will put you back to bed. Come. Tomorrow we will go to hospital. Kathy? Where are you going? Are you not staying here with us? Why? I made a mistake. I am not your sister. I know you are my sister. Stop lying. I am not lying. We can be brother and sister from another mother. -I love you, my sister. -Me too, Noah. Gift for you. I found it in the forest. Come. I will give you things to eat in the forest. There are chocolate desserts, cheese, apple juice... Some... ON THE RUN TO SEBASTIEN K., FOR ETERNITY Subtitling: Hiventy
