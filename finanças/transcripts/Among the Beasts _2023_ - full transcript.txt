[barking] What has water but no fish, forests but no trees, and deserts but no sand? [phone ringing] [hums] Help me out. [Kayla] No, it's a riddle. Come on, you're not gonna help me out? Wait, so you're gonna leave me hanging? -I don't know. -[Kayla] It's a map. -That's what I said. -No, you didn't. -[Paul] I said map. -Mm-hmm. [Paul] I whispered it, you didn't hear? -No. -I said, "map." -[Kayla] No, you didn't. -I did. -[Kayla] No, you didn't. -I did. [Kayla] Mm-mm. [Paul] Let's make up something. - ♪ I was at the vet... ♪ -[Kayla chuckles] ♪ ...with my pet, George ♪ I mean I-- you're the singer, I never said I was a singer, you said you were a singer, so-- -[man] Hey, Kayla. -[Kayla] Hi. [Vet 1] I'll take him now, okay? Don't worry, he'll be right back, okay? [dogs barking] You worried about George? Yeah, but I think he'll be all right. [Paul] Yeah, I think he will too. But if he's not, we can't just say yes, we have to talk to your mother first and see how much it's gonna cost. Screw the cost. -Don't say "screw." -Screw, screw, screw. Hey. George is very lucky to have you watching his six. We'll figure it out. -Mama is still not quite-- -She's trying. [Kayla] Just wish she'd try a little bit harder. Give her some time, she'll get there. -[Vet 2] Hey, Kayla. -[Kayla] Hi. [Vet 2] Wanna come back and see Georgie? Yeah. [Vet 2] All right, it is the first one on the right. [barking] [Kayla] Hi, Georgie. How are you? Good. [Vet 2] Hang on there, George, hang on there, sweetie. Oh, hi. I don't think we've met. -[Paul] Hey. -This is LT. He's my dad's commanding officer. -[Paul] Paul. -[vet2 ] Hi, nice to meet you. George doesn't have an infection and that's what we were most worried about. But we did find out -that he has asthma. -[Kayla] Wow. There's medication to treat him, okay? But you're going to have to give it to him every day, probably for a couple of years, okay? That's fine. It's fine. [Vet 2] Okay. We've got George's six, right LT? No matter what. [man] Made of glass I'm 'bout to shatter it. -Come on. Let's rock. -[man 2] Do your thing, man. [man] Ooh, you look like a straight chicken right here, boy. [man 2] Give him everything you got, Stevey. [man] Imma cook you tonight. What're you gonna do, dawg? [man 3] Full tilt boogie, baby, let's go. [grunting] -[man 2] God damn! -[grunts] -[Mac] Very nice. -[man 2] That's it, Stevey! [Mac] Back okay? -Yeah. -[Mac] Good. [man 2] That's what I'm talking about motherfucker. How was that? It was good, you're making good decisions, you're thinking fast. -Any more? -Him and him. -[Mac] Step right up, fellas. -[Steve] Same time. [opponent] Try this shit with me, Stevey. [man 3] Look how serious he looks. [opponent] Come on, man, let's go. Come on, motherfucker. Let's go. [grunting] [man 4] Hey, hey! -[Mac] Nice! -[grunting] Watch your back! [opponent grunts] Hit me in the fucking throat. -[Mac] Nice! -[Paul] All right. Enough. Everyone walk away and take a fucking chill pill. [opponent] This is supposed to be training, fucker. [Steve] Talk about a fucking party pooper. Nice floor work, but he's playing too rough. [opponent] Throat's fucking throbbing. What do you want? It's tough enough finding somewhere that will let you spar. Three on one and somebody wearing handcuffs. But he gets a reputation as a crazy fuck. This could be crazy or fucked. Teddy will make us all find another gym. Get him to pull it back. He's got one place where he can let it hang out, come on. Somebody saying something? -Yeah, me. -You want to say it to me? [opponent] Oh! [Steve] A little too rough for you? Pull it back. [Mac] Stevie. You trying to hurt one of these guys? -Is that what you want? -[Mac] Okay, okay. He copies you. Say, "okay" Stevie. -Okay, Stevie. -Okay. Let's hit the shower. [Steve] Yes, sir, Dr. Freud. Hitting the shower. [laughing] I'm Dr. Freud now. You should be a tag team, get you in here. I'm sure I can find an opponent who'd love to kick your ass. -Yeah, I'm good. -[cell phone buzzes and dings] [Mac] Are you? It's been so long since you fought, I can't remember if you are anymore. Let's get some sushi. What is it? [Terry] I need you to clear that area in front of the elevator. We're talking to the detective, we're gonna get it all sorted, okay? And we're gonna find her, okay? I know it's a lot, but it's gonna-- Hi. Family friend, Paul. Hi, I'm Alex. I'm Kayla's therapist. Her mom's in with the detective right now. -Thank you for being here. -[Alex] No, of course. Um, you know what, I actually have to get somebody to cover my afternoon, um, trauma group so-- Well, hey, you know what? -I got this. We're good here. -Got this, have you? [Alex] No, no, I-- I need to be here. -I need to be here. -No, we're good here. I need you to move away from those elevators, we gotta keep that space clear. [Alex] Okay, just give us, uh, one second. Could you give us a minute please? Um, are you okay? Are you sure? -Yeah. -Thank you. -Tell me what happened. -The fuck do you care? Put that shit aside for now. You can go back to hating me as soon as she's home safe and sound, but for now, we're on the same side. Yeah? We got woken up by the cops this morning saying they found her bag on the sidewalk outside some bar. Anything taken? Mm-mm. Shit, that's bad, isn't it? Not necessarily. Look at it this way, if her stuff was missing, we wouldn't even know anything had happened to her yet. There'd be more time. The cops would be behind them. -[Bella] "Them?" -[Paul] I just meant-- Oh, my God. You think it was a them? No. [Bella] So then what are you saying? No. I'm sorry, but no. You don't get to do that right now. You're stronger than your mother. I love Lucy like a sister, but stable is not a word I'd use to describe her. So, you got to be tough. Who was Kayla with last night? A few friends, but she walked home by herself. [Lucy] LT! [crying] They took her, LT, they took her. [Chris] It's day one. We don't know anything yet, all right? [Lucy] We know they've taken my baby. Okay, uh, now look, I read your initial statement to the officer and you said Kayla was with friends-- I don't fucking know who she was with. You don't know who your daughter was with last night? Was she-- was she at someone's house? Was she in the street? Was she at a bar? My 12-year-old sister was not at a bar. -We found a backpack in front-- -I know what you're doing. I'm trying to help-- I'm trying to find your daughter. You're saying I'm a shit mother. No, I'm not-- I'm not-- I'm not saying that. Can we get another detective over here, please? Please lower your voice, this isn't McDonald's, you don't just order any cop you want, okay? [Bella] Obviously we got McAsshole. [Lucy] Okay, enough. Enough. -[Alex] Hold on for one second. Everything all right over there, Chris? Terry, Terry-- Just give us a second. Look, you gotta clear those people out of the hall. We know about your elevator, Terry. [Terry] Clear out, use the office. We got it, we got it. Okay. Just a second, um, Detective, thank you for everything -that you're doing. -[Chris] Of course. Ma'am, is there any chance that your daughter might just be still out partying? I'll say it again. She's 12. I-- I understand that, I can't assume anything. We assume you're being a dickhead. -Please watch your mouth. -All right, um-- -Fuck off. -Come on, now. All right, look, I'm trying to help... -I-- I-- yes. And we-- -...okay? And I'll-- I'll reach out as soon as we know anything. -[Alex] Yes. -[Chris] Okay? -Thank you so much. -Okay. [Alex] Thank you, we really appreciate your help. [elevator dings] It's okay. It's all right. -[Bella sobs] -They're gonna help. -I'm sorry. All right. -[Bella sobs] -Hey, let me, please -[Alex] All right. We're going to figure it out, though. -[Lucy sobs] -Okay? They're on it. We get... [traffic din] Say it. -He should be here, not you. -[Paul] I know. You know, there's a part of me that will always blame you for what happened to him. There's a part of me that will always agree with you. But I've seen you with Kayla... and I know this isn't you just keeping some promise you made. I know she's precious to you like how she was to him. You were precious to him as well. Just bring my little sister home, LT. -[Paul scoffs] -Please. Bella, what the fuck are you talking about? Look, I read the stats. It'll just go on a pile. The cops barely find people in cases like this, so they hardly try. Look, I'll do everything you ask, okay? I promise. I'll be the tough one and I'll swallow it all down and I'll keep everyone in decent shape. -But you find her. -Bella, this is a mess. -What can I-- -[Bella] Right there! That look in your eyes. Use that. Look, there was only four of us. We lost a quarter of our family that day. We can't lose another. We can't be down to half. You promised him. You gave him your word you would look over her. And you have. You take her to soccer practice and you bring her home every time. I'm just asking you to do what you always do. Bring her home. Okay? [suspenseful music playing] [contemplative guitar riff playing] [bar din] [indistinct chatter] [electronic music playing through speakers] What can I get you, man? -Soda. -All right. -What kind you want? -Surprise me. -Your place? -[bartender] Yeah. -For better or for worse. -Hm. [bar din] Did you know a girl was taken from out front of here -last night? -[bartender] No, no, no. -[Paul] Yeah, she was. -No. Cops found some purse outside there this morning. I don't want you in here asking about some missing girl, man. Is she your daughter? My friend's daughter. [man speaking Spanish] [man speaking Spanish] Uh... [speaking Spanish] -Claro, claro. -[bartender] Yeah. -Anyways-- -Amigo. [man] Hey, papi, let me-- let me walk you to the door real quick, make sure you don't slip on your motherfucking shoelaces on the way out. Did you notice this girl last night? No. Could you look at the picture, please? What picture? This one. [sucking his teeth] Think it's time for you to go, brother. Excuse me. I need to talk to you for a second. I want to ask you if you've seen this girl. [customer] Dude, I'm just trying to chill here. She was taken from out front of here last night. I'm going to pass this phone around. I want everybody to take a look. Please, take a look. -[customer 2] Okay. -[customer 3] Give it here, man. It's not that kind of party, baby. Now you done fucked up. You're making a mistake here. You, all by yourself. -[speaking Spanish] -[grunting] [customer 2] Jesus Christ! -[man 2] Hey! -[customer 4] Oh, my God. -[screaming] -[grunting] -[man groaning] -[bottles clattering] -[customer] God damn. -[man 2 groans] [customer 2] Are you fucking kidding me? [man 2 groans] Look at the photo. [bartender] Please, man. Please. [groaning] [customer 2] Jesus Christ. [man coughs and groans] -[man] Oh, fuck. -[Paul] [indistinct] [bartender] Please. [man groans] [man 2 groans] [customer 5] I've never seen her, bro. [customer 6] Fuck. [customer 7] Oh, fuck. [customer 8] Oh, my God, did you see that? I know. good God, that was insane. [overlapping chatter] [woman] You know, because I used to be fun and the life of the party, everyone liked me the way I was. So, apparently I did some bad things -when I was drinking too much. -[Alex] Right. But, I really don't understand how to be any different. [Alex] So, you feel like without the alcohol, you are not the same person? And that person, you were validated for? [woman] Yeah, yeah. I was funny, it was fun, and really, if it hadn't been for those little incidents, um, I think I would be fine and great. And I don't think I really needed to quit drinking, but, to be honest, I think I drink sometimes to make other people interesting. [Alex] Interesting. Okay, there's a lot that we need to, um, unwrap here, but we need to end our session now. But we will continue with that next time. I hope I will see each and every one of you at the Be Positive barbecue this weekend. Um, and until then, I hope you have a great week. -Okay? Bye, you guys. -[woman 2] Bye, Dr. Alex. Thank you, Graham. [indistinct chatter] [sirens wailing in the distance] -[Paul] Excuse me. -[Alex] Mm-hmm? Hi, um, my name is Paul and-- [Alex] Oh, Paul. Right, right, right. How's Lucy? She's, um, not doing so hot. Yeah. Uh, can I ask you some questions? Of course, yes. Um... I was just wondering if there was anything you can tell me about your time with Kayla. Um, anything she may have said-- You know, I wish there was, Paul, I really do. I mean, Kayla was a happy kid. I mean, you know that. She used to spend sessions trying to make me laugh, -you know, making up those, um-- -Her riddles. Riddles. Yes, the riddles. You know, I-- I... I don't think she ran away, if that's what you're asking. No, I don't either. I-- I meant more um... were there any friends, older maybe, that she talked about, people she might have just met who-- You know, Kayla's sessions were court-ordered, right? Because of all the stuff with her mom. So, if anything like that happened, I was mandated to let CPS know immediately. -Oh, yeah, no, I'm not saying-- -No, no, I-- I know. I'm just-- listen, I will answer your questions for as long as you want. I just wish that there was something more helpful that I could offer you. Do you mind if I play therapist for a second and ask you how you're doing? I'm good. You know... Kayla told me a lot... about you, she talked about you a lot. But, what she didn't tell me... was how bad of a liar you are. Wish I had been there when she needed me. No, no, no, no. Paul, don't do that. We always want to find something to blame in moments like this. Even if it's ourselves, but you can't do that. It's not helpful. Hm. -[car horn honking] -[traffic din] -[suspenseful music playing] -[traffic din] [contemplative guitar melody playing] [razor blade knocking against the table] [snorts and exhales] [sighs] [children chattering in the distance] [laughs] Shit, motherfuck-- Hey! [laughs] Hey! Yeah, yeah, yeah. [snorts, exhales, and sniffs] [sighs] Fuck you, Eddie, what would you be saying, man? You see me like this, right? [sobs] I'm all right. I'm good, bro. Don't you worry about me, all right? I'm okay. [panting] Fucking buck up. [sniffling] This shit right. [laughs] [banging] -[Steve] Upstairs. -[footsteps approaching] Yeah, up here. [Mac] Let's get him in the bathroom. -[Steve] We gotta move. -[Mac] Come on, man. Come on, up you go. [grunting] Easy. I got him. Put him down here. LT. What'd you take, man? -[Paul grunts] -Hm? What did you take? What did you take, asshole? [Steve] Wake up, man. Answer him. Hey, he's gonna keep on doing that 'til you answer, man. Yeah, I got pulled off a date for this shit. Slap you for fun, now. I know, Stevey. [Mac] Shit. [Steve] Here you go. Into the tub. -[Paul groans] -[Mac] Xanax and Valium. [Steve] That shit's coming up, right? LT, I'm gonna stick my fingers down your throat. If you bite me, I will break your fucking nose. -[Paul indiscernibly groaning] -All right? -[Paul indiscernibly groaning] -Stop fucking moving. [Paul gagging] [Paul vomits] [Mac] Where the fuck are we, Paul? -[Paul coughing and panting] -[Steve] There's more. One more time, man. One more time. [Paul panting] [Mac] The fuck, man? Paul, this shit's gotta stop. -Nobody asked you to come over. -You fucking called me. -I called you? -[laughs] Yeah. -[Paul] Why would I do that? -Fuck if I know. You know, usually, if you're really gonna do it, you don't call. I was probably calling to say goodbye. Next time, don't. -[Steve] Dude-- -Fuck you. I failed him, Mac. I swore I'd look after his daughter, and I... We owed him. What happened to Bobby was our fault, our responsibility, we--- [Paul choking] [Mac] I don't ever want to hear those words come out of your mouth again. You got it? I love my brother and I love you. But I won't let you hurt us, just to unburden your own conscience. [Steve] Come on, man. Come on, man. -Seriously! -[Paul wheezing and coughing] [Paul grunting] Where the fuck are we, Paul? Airbnb. [laughs] Pretty nice spot. Go out in style? Eh, something like that. Jesus Christ. Stevie, go call a cleaning company and find somebody, maybe Dean, to fix the front door. [Steve] Copy. -Steve? -[Steve] Yes, sir? [Paul] You said you was on a date. I did. Going well? [laughing] -[laughing] -Fuck you both! [Mac] Oh, God. How did you find me, Mac? -[Mac] Don't worry about it. -Mac. Jordy. [Paul] Shit. Put a track and trace on your phone after you called me. What'd he tell his boss? He said he was following up a lead on a case. He lied. This shit's got to hit the road, brother. You got to be done with it and then be done with it. I got to get home. It's my weekend with the kids. Stevey will stick around. Get this shit straight. Don't try to kill yourself again today. I already looked for her. [sighs] Didn't even go looking for her. You kept her dog. She loved that fucking dog and you kept it safe. That's something. That's bottom of the fucking barrel. Maybe that's all you got left to give, man. [water running] [Tiny indistinct] While the fire fight is going on... the VC button planted an anti-tank mine. -So, he got blown up. -Instead of you. -Instead of me. -Yeah. So, now what happens is, I get out of my track and show up and I go running up to him and the poor guy was-- he was covered... he didn't wear his-- the flack jacket, so he was covered from the waist up with burning oil. The only part of him that wasn't burnt was his actual hair because he had, you know, the-- one of the-- -the track helmets on. -Right. Everything else was burnt. So... when I ran up to him, he started to fall. Natural first reaction, try to catch him. Yeah. Uh... -All right. -You're all right. Yeah, I just have a little problem with this. And, uh, his skin came off on my hands. -You know what I mean? -Yeah. And my nickname in the service, for whatever reason, was Tiny. And the last words I got out of him was, you know, "Tiny don't let me die." We got him on the medevac. He lasted about a month and then the heart gave out. [continuing indistinctly] -[indistinct] -[man] Hey, Tiny. Where's LT? [Tiny] He's in the bathroom, making himself look pretty. [man] LT! I wanna buy you a drink [Tiny] It was because-- because it was-- [men laughing] It was probably the first war ever that they didn't do anything strategically. Where they took a-- they took a place, whatever, because they wanted numbers, they wanted body counts and so forth. So, we took this thing three times to give it back each time Washington wanted you on the hill, then they wanted you off the hill. -[man laughs] -[Tiny] Well-- but, I mean-- Yeah, but you know what? It was the first war that I know of that was actually, instead of being run by the Pentagon, it was run by Congress. And that was just plain asinine. No, because you got all politicians there, you know, making decisions. -[indistinct chatter] -[Tiny] And they're not the-- [man] Brendan! [indistinct chatter] Brendan, you alcoholic! He's actually not kidding. [overlapping chatter] [Tiny] You want to mumble that again? [all laughing] [man 2] He never shuts up. [man 3] What the fuck? A human IED. [all laughing] -[Mac] Hey, welcome home. -Oh, I'm fine. [laughter] [man 3] Hey, shut up-- [man 4] Who told you guys to talk? I said be quiet-- [overlapping chatter] -[man 3] Tiny! -[Tiny] Never saw it coming. [Jordy] You don't look good. What do you mean I don't look good? You don't look good. You look like you're bad saying you're good. -That doesn't even make sense. -[Jordy] It does make sense. Jordy-- You're saying the word good, but your eyes don't read good, your eyes read bad. You know, when you're coming back and you're getting all this stuff. Because I had one time, you know, uh, division at the time, just mechanized infantry division. And we were attached to the... Screaming Eagles, the 101st. [quiet music playing] [tense music playing] [Lola] Hey, Paul. Do I know you? I come in peace. Come in peace, standing exactly where you are. Tell your friend behind me my knife will be buried in your heart before he's ever raised that gun. [dog barking in distance] Let's get to who you are real quick, yeah? I am someone whose 12 year old cousin was abducted from the Bronx three days ago. -[door latches] -[drawer rattles] Pick it up on your way out. How do we know that you don't have a gun in here? I do have a gun in here. -[gun rattles] -[drawer creaks] Sorry about your cousin. -Sophia. -[Paul] Sophia. But I don't know how I can help. [AJ] We know you were looking for a kid awhile back. Just tell us everything that happened with your friend's daughter. [Lola] And we thought you might sympathize with my situation, given your loss. -Who am I talking to here? -[AJ] Nigga, can you count? -Both of us is here. -Talk to me. -Guess I know now, huh? -What're you smirking for? [Lola] Hey. Tell this nigga if he goes for the backup piece on his ankle, he'll die right where he stands. -[Lola] AJ. -[AJ] Huh? Chill out. -I'm cool. -No, you're not. You should rest. -[Lola speaking Spanish] -[Paul speaking Spanish] AJ. Go sit in the corner and think about what you've done. Put down the gun and get in the conversation, Paul. Because worse than AJ pulling out the wrong weapon would be certain people finding out that you pulled a weapon, any fucking weapon, on Juan Gomez's daughter. Who's Juan Gomez? You're daddy's little girl? I don't think you want to be talking to me like that. He's locked up right? Daddy? -[dogs barking in distance] -[Paul scoffs] [Lola] Can you tell me what happened to your friend's daughter, please? [Paul] I didn't find her. That's what happened. I have a witness... who thinks that he might have seen the van that Sophia was kidnapped in. He even got part of a license plate. An A and a Y. Kid drew it for us. We don't want to go to the police for obvious reasons. So, I thought that you might have some contacts who could help us under the radar. Kind of contacts who could get an ex-soldier out of lockup the day that he punches a cop on a street full of people. -Should I be flattered? -[Lola] No charges. -You used my phone call. -You punched a police officer. -Time to go. -I'll pay you. Ten grand? Time to go. Big Juan, it's Juan Gomez. [Paul] Who the fuck's Juan Gomez? Who the fuck's Juan Gomez? Juan Gomez, he's got a giant piece of the drugs coming in and out of Queens. My colleagues have been investigating this piece of shit for years. He's doing ten years upstate as of a few months ago. His daughter runs the operation while he's gone. So we're getting in bed with Mexican drug dealers now, are we? Good stuff. Good decision making. What? What that? What is it? What? Do you remember that time Bobby laughed so hard that he shat himself in that fucking bunker? [laughs] And we had to stay there, we couldn't-- -there was nowhere to go. -[both laughing] -Fucking stew eating idiot. -[Paul] Oh, my God. So, what did you say to the Mexican chick? [Paul] I said no. No, no, you're not-- Jordy, come on. You-- you know everyone, man. And your office alone-- just get one of your colleagues to give us a list of registered sex offenders in the area and I can--- You can go door to door and beat up everybody in Queens until what? You happen upon the asshole who has her? You're making this about Kayla. What do you want me to do, Jordy? -Go be with Bella and Lucy. -[Paul] Why? Let the Mexicans do their thing -while we do ours. -Which is what? [Jordy] Which is to look after Bobby's family, like he would have done for any of us. This is not gonna bring Kayla back. I hate to be the one to say it. -That girl's dead. -[Paul] We owe Bobby better. -Go the fuck home. -It was our idea. -You mean it was my idea. -I made the call. You act like you're the only one who loved him. Like you're the only one who hurts. Like, you're the only one who misses him. Well, it's bullshit. We were all there, man. All of us. We all hurt, and we all see his face in the dark when we're alone. You don't own that. I made the call, Jordy. Yeah. You made the call. [quiet music playing over speakers] [clock ticking] [calling tone beeping] [calling tone beeping] [Jordy indistinct over phone] the fuck you want? Yeah, yeah, shut the fuck up. You don't sleep anyway. Listen, I need you to get one of your colleagues to look into something for me. [Jordy indistinct] [suspenseful music] And Hernandez is coming tomorrow. -Mm-hmm. Wired. Yeah. -[Lola] Wired. [man] AJ! [AJ] Please tell me I can throw him out. [Lola] No. Send him over. And AJ. Be polite. Show him the side of you that I know. [electronic music playing] Not this guy. -That's how I look? -Yeah. It's not cute. [electronic music playing] Swipe right. [traffic din] Is that the van? Maybe. Who gave this to you? If I told you that, he'd stop doing favors for me. -I mean, this has got to be it. -Might be. -[Lola] Do you know where it is? -Parked in the street in Queens. -Where? -[Paul] Three things. First, you don't make a move without me. -As in not one. -Wait. Sorry, you're giving me conditions? Do you have any idea what I could do to you? No, what could you do? I hire and fire tough guys like you everyday. Oh, I'm not a tough guy. Second, I'm in charge. We do it all as a team, but if a call is needed, I make it, -you comply. -The fuck? Someone has to be in charge and it sure as shit ain't gonna be you. [Lola] Why the fuck would I let you-- Do you know where the van is parked? Okay. You're the man. -What's third? -Third, no cops. Fuckin' duh. [train rumbling] [tense music playing] We could be waiting days for this guy to even show up. Or girl. Sure, I'll play. We could be waiting days for this girl that we're going to fuck up to show. [Paul chuckles] How many guys does your father have looking for Sophia? Um. He doesn't know you and AJ are looking for her, does he? What are you talking about? [Paul] He didn't want to bring attention to the business, did he? That gonna be a problem, Lieutenant? I prefer playing off the radar. Okay, good. [suspenseful music playing] Hey, look. -[Paul] Wait, wait, wait-- -Yeah, whatever you say, boss. We don't even know if that's the guy. ♪ [intense music playing] [phone ringing] -[phone ringing] -Fuck. You want to chat while I'm chasing? That's exactly what I want to do. Keep telling me where you are. He's running like a fucking bat out of hell. -Don't shoot him. -I don't have a gun. Why the hell are you chasing him then? He's-- he's going into the dry cleaner. No, don't go in after him. [Lola] He's gonna try to go out the back. -[Diego speaking Spanish] -[Lola] Who the fuck are you? -[Diego grunts] -[tense music playing] -[Lola grunts] No! -[Diego speaking Spanish] Oh, okay, okay. [Diego speaking Spanish] I-- I'm in the dry cleaner's. I'm in the dry cleaner's.
