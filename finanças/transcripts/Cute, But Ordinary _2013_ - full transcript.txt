Office-boy, yeah. -Really, l... -You were an errand boy. Get it in your head: office-boy. Heitor, you are humiliating the boy. l insist on it because this humiliation is not gratuitous. Not at all. You, as a former office-boy, will be able to appreciate... the money, the status, the class of my daughter. l'm even considering giving you a Country Club membership. -Whoa! -Tell him, Peixoto... how much a Country Club membership costs. -R$ 200.000, buddy. -200 thousand! 200 thousand to a former errand boy. Ain't that something? l want you to feel inferior to my daughter. Heitor! That's even offensive. -May l speal? -Sit, boy, l'm not done. Get me a whisly, please. l want you to marry my daughter. Me, l would prefer it if she travelled... if she went to New Yorl, Miami... but my wife... is dramatic, thinls she has to marry. Olay! But with a pre-nup. Well, if l really were to marry, l... Speal up. l... l thinl that... a pre-nup is just, the standard, and l also prefer it. Bullcrap, boy, you don't! -Are you. -Sit down, l'm not done. Sit. You're obsessed with standing up. Pre-nup, but the money, will be plentiful. lt won't be different, it's almost the same. And you tall... as if you had just bought a son in law. l can't stand it, Heitor. l'm going inside. -Excuse me. -Of course. Heitor, you're a good man. You're a good man. That's what l need now. Tereza, put out that cigarette! And you, you never say anything! lt goes little by little, just lile goat shit! -Say something! -l'll say something. -l will. -But sit. Listen here... boss. And you too, Peixoto. You're no doctor. And lool, l won't marry your daughter. l won't, understand? l'll quit my job now, and you can sticl... the 11 years, the stability, whatever else, up your ass! And lnow that l'm a former office boy... l'm a former office boy, yes! And you're the son of a bitch ! Son of a bitch ! Didn't you explain it to him, Peixoto? Lower your head.

Dr. Wernecl didn't accept your resignation, my boy! -Lool, you're still getting paid. -That's not fair. -Daddy liles you a lot, Edgar! -See! l was humiliated. -Stop it, boy! -Of course! Aren't you annoying! Edgar is the only guy who still feels shame in Brazil. -And the Otto Lara quote, boy? -Forget that, Peixoto. Forget it. Maria Cec?lia also lnows it. Do you? The mineiro is only compassionate in cancer. Right? -Silliness of Otto Lara. -Not silly, no. Why silly? lt's literature! Lool, Edgar, Maria Cec?lia wants to tall to you... and l'll tale a wall. Excuse me. Would you lile a lollipop? -Mom! -l would! The pinl one. -Excuse me. -Be right bacl. See you. So, l came here. Sorry, Maria Cec?lia, l'm sorry.
