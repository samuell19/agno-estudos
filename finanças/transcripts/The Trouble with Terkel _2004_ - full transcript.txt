Subtitles by Midas and Ghesus --Terkel in Trouble-- Hi children! Are you comfortable? My name is Arne and I'm going to tell you a story about a boy I know called Terkel Terkel is a healthy boy, except from when he is sick of course But he's a good kid and he's got bones in the nose Now you might think: "bones in the nose? That hurts?" but that's just somthing you say about a person who is intelligent or about people who sneezes while they're eating fish Anyways... Terkel lived in a small town in a red house together with his mom Beate and his dad Leon Beate and Leon were pretty fair parents they just had a tiny bit of a problem agreeing about stuff ..and that's the way it is! No Yes it is No Yes! No! Mom and dad, can't you stop discussing all the time? Terkel we're not discussing, we're quarreling, right? No... Yes we are! No! Yes we most certainly are! ... Yeeeees...! Terkel also had a little sister Hey Terkel... Her name was Rita. Not now Rita, I'm busy Weren't we supposed to go to school together? Yes... we were NOT supposed to go together Terkel was in 6th grade at Kastanjevangen School His best friend is Jason Hey what's up Terkel...! How's it hanging, dude? Are you "fresh"? Yeah... I just haven't made my arithmetic homework Ah nasty shit... but on the other side... Fuck it! Jason came from Albertslund (rough neighborhood) That's why he talked a bit differently And that's also why he always carried an iron pipe in his pocket Ah bummer! There's Johanna Haha, she's allready seen you Jason Hey Jason What's up Johanna? How... how's it going? "how's it going?" ?! Ermm... Bye bye... But Jason... Goodbye Johanna She's completely in to you Yeah, I know It's just that she talks so weird that it makes me trip - easy there There were also 2 really mean boys in Terkel and Jason's class They were called Sten and Saki They used most of their recess' on bullying a chubby girl named Dorit Cool Sten What's up Porky Pig... you fat today? Again today! I swear, chubby Dorit is always fat, haha Friday morning's program was music with the class' favourite teacher Arne Nougatbranch Hehe, believe it or not, that's me!

I studied my grandfather's Encyclopedia of Music this weekend and there I saw the expression "funky" What does it mean? Listen up kids... music isn't supposed to be read or analysed Music is supposed to be tasted and felt, to be listened and danced to. There's music in everything For instance Jason's iron pipe Or in Solveigh's cellular phone that rings in class Well kids! Let's get some instruments and fire it up That's the way Jason That's a good beat ...the guitar is mine! 2, 3, 4... Birte a bit more groovy please We're rolling..!

Thanks children "Arne is way cool!" "I'm too coool!"

If you know what that is? It's a... yes Silas? I know what it is The children already knew about these "Rudolf Steiner Schools" which in short terms are schools that believe toys should be boring to play with Preferrably a stupid wooden doll with no face That's something the kids have to imagine for themselves I once had i grildfriend like this She wasn't made out of wood though... unfortunately Anyways... back to the class Yes, thank you Silas for the explanation Well kids, we better get to know each other better I've brought along a peasack which we can throw to each other while we state our names I can start, I'm Gunnar and err.. how about we just take the rest of the day off?

Knew what? And then Terkel told everything that happened Saturday night Haha, get the fuck out of here. Awesome I would've liked to see that Funny haha. I'm the one who will get all the trouble Do you think it's that bad? I got i message from the Gorilla Club which I'm a member... hey boys! What's up!

Well as I said before, I've received a message from the Gorilla Club They wrote that the piebald salamander was seen 3 days ago... ...just out in the Degne moor. So I have arranged a camping trip Easy now... that's it We're leaving Wednesday morning so I need your mom or dad's signature... ...stating that it's okay that you sleep out at the moor Excuse me Gunnar?!

Of course Terkel Let go of me girls... This way Terkel ...it's just Sten and Saki, they won't stop teasing me Are they teasing you?! Yeah, they call me a sissy, animal tormentor and a mimic I think that sounds awful, Terkel Actually I think that you should strike back But how? Which of them is the boss? Sten, I think... Then I think you should confront Sten One should always go after the boss, then the others will automatically get out of your way I think that you should go over to Sten and say: Hey dude, what about yourself? "What about yourself?"... "What about yourself?"! Then they'll see how wrong they've been Okay, thanks Gunnar Look, here comes the animal tormentor And what about yourself? Huh? Yeah Sten, what about yourself? What the hell is he babbling about? Yeah, what do you mean? I say, "What about yourself?"! "What about yourself" (gold letters) "What about yourself?!" "You're just a loser" "You call me a cruelty, sissy and a mimic" "You're a goof and totaly disgusting" "Come on! Are you a wuzz?" "You long sock!" "'Cause your pants flutters when I'm beating you" "A shoe right in the ass" "I'll kick your mom in her cunt" "screaming everybody get the fuck out" "You can step on the one ones lying on the ground" "And those who whisper are lying" "Unless they whisper that I'm cool!" "My mouth will not be silent" "Dickheads better watchout" "If there's more trouble with you" "I'll squeal on you" "'Cause what you say is what you are" "It's in the news" "That you're a toffee" "You're it, punkass" "Give me five!"

" "I'm going to motherfucking tell the grown ups" "Biatch" Sissy boy! Yeah, totally a sissy.. and a mimic It probably won't come as a surprise to you that adults don't know what goes on in kids heads And least of all how to avoid getting bullied What's up crybaby? chickenshit? What the fuck is wrong with you? Nothing. I'm just tired. Terkel speaking. Terkel, you're not at the ramp again, are you? But normally I'm allowed to.. Listen here.

Welcome to the Hotline for Kids Stewart speaking. Hey Stewart, it's Terkel Hi Terkel. I'm working right now I know... You have to call later... I have to be ready to take care of the children's problems But I do have problems Is that a fact. That's why I'm calling Fair enough, go on sailor I'm getting bullied at school... So, what's the problem? They say I'm an animal tormentor, a mime... Yeah, I have to say that's not bloody original! What about super analdripping creep? But..? Or eskimo drugwhore son-of-a-bitch? Hey, here's a good one. Flabby gazelle cockhead Stewart..? Gross bitch-of-a-nasty-fucking-leatherface But Stewart you have to help me! Ofcourse my son, that's why I'm here Problems are here to be solved, you know Sometimes you just have to acknowledge that you can't solve them yourself And never be afraid to cry out for help Now I'm going to tell you an advice that my dad gave me "Ask for help" "If you are in doubt" "Ask for help 'cause it's near" "And it can save lives" "One can't manage all problems by oneself" "You can count on Stewart" "Just ask for help" I have personally helped out a few kids myself, listen: "Yesterday I met a boy who weeped" "He couldn't find his way back home" "And he was afraid of the dark" "The kiddo said: dear Stewart can you help me?" "I took out my knife and yelled BOOH!" "And suddenly he found his way home" "And then I remember Viktor " "His dad really cruel" "He beat the kid yellow and blue" "Whenever he had the time" "Victor called me up one day" "and complained about his situation" "Unfortunately I was busy that day" "So now Viktor is dead" "Ask for help if you need answers" "You can call night and day" "This captain is ready" "Push the 8 digits if you are feeling down" "And if I'm out drinking you can leave a message!" Can't I just get some help...? That's right Terkel That's what you have to say, if one day the shit hits the fan Take care and tell your dad that I'm popping by to hand out some beatdown one of these days "Death to the animal tormentor" No! Please I don't want to die! What is going on here? Have you seen this mess, Leon? No What is it you're playing in here? A stone came through the window It didn't just come through the window by itself. Maybe this will teach you not to play with fire another time Terkel kept some distance to Sten and Saki in the schoolyard If they were capable of throwning bricks through a window Then who knew what they could be up to Oh oh...! Hey look, there he is, the tormentor Hey mime! A damn army whore Trying to hide, are you, huh? Won't you just please leave me be? Now now there sissyboy, don't cry You little animal tormentor Blinking your eyes, huh? Afraid of your mom and dad? Terkel was wondering what to do, when the class' fat girl Dorit came over You know what Terkel? Don't mind them. They're just jealous Dorit? Terkel had never talked to Dorit before He had actually never really noticed her She was just a part of class What is it? It's just a letter, but you don't have to read it now. Look! Chubby Dorit and the sissy are lovers See, Terkel has cried Then it's good thing that he has his girlfriend Chubby Dorit Yeah, they are lovers And what if we are?! You're just damn jealous Fat porky Hey Terkel, are you really in love with Dorit? Terkel felt like talking back and help Dorit just as she had tried to help him But instead Terkel did what one would do with the back against the wall He passed the ball... Ermm, no I'm not in love with a fat fucking cow like her That was all that was needed for Sten and Saki to forget all about Terkel... ...and jump all over the poor Dorit Haha, fat cow. Chubby whalefish. Beached Whale, John Goodman Where are you going Chubby Dorit? Stay here you fat cow Wow, that went pretty quick, huh? Terkel was paralysed by horror Even though he could hear himself say: Let's hope no one got hit by the fat cow Cool said Terkel It looked really awesome Hurray for Terkel Imagine someone can bleed so much That's obvious if you're a fat cow, right Terkel? Terkel? Wait a sec... Tell me, what really happened up in the class? Erhm, she jumped out of the window Fair play, okay then... Luckily no one was hit by that fat cow The letter?! "Dear Terkel... "I love you" "You're the only good thing in my life" "I get bullied everyday" "And I can barely take it" "It's because of you that I'm still alive" "Forever Yours, Dorit" One more sausage, Leon? No... Yes you do No..! That's the way it is! So Terkel... What have you been doing in school today? Today I got bullied so much that I chose to bully Chubby Dorit Finally she got so upset that she jumped out of the window from the 3rd floor Well, then you must've had your hands full. Mom, she actually died! Rita, if you want the Toothfairy to come this year then you surely don't want to chew so noisely Hi Terkel. Stay out Rita Don't you want to play with my cut-out dolls? I don't "play"! But you play with Jason? We don't play, we're just together Don't you want to be together with me and my dolls then? Keep out! "Psychopath on the loose" (Frontpage) Dad, I need to talk to you I have some problems in school and there's no one who wants to help me So won't you please hear me out? Noooo! Mom...? What is it Terkel? Want to play? Forever and ever? Nooooo Come over here Terkel Where are you going? Watch out that you don't rust Terkel "I'm comming, I'm comming" "I'm comming to get ya" "I'm comming, I'm comming" "I'm comming to touch you" "I'll shread what you think is safe" "I'm the shadow behind the curtain" "I'm the branch on your window" "I'm a sound from your closet" "I'm a voice inside your head" "I'm the tormented souls" "The distorted cries" "From those in the computer games that burned to death" "As your mom and dad who only believe what they can see" "They say I don't exist. What do they know?" "They are asleep when I haunt, when I give you my thrill" "It's not them I'm visiting, when I give you my scare" "I'm saying:" "I'm comming, I'm comming" "I'm comming to get ya" "I'm comming, I'm comming" "I'm comming to touch you" "I'll shread what you think is safe" "Paranoia so loud it makes you go insane" "I'm saying:" "I'm comming, I'm comming" "I'm comming to get ya" "I'm comming, I'm comming" "I'm comming to touch you" "I'll shread what you think is safe" "You're a deadman Terkel" Who had wrote it? Was it Sten and Saki who had put salt in his erm... bad conscience? It just had to be Terkel have you seen the spare key? What? It's not in its usual place out in the shed I haven't seen it Here, I've packed your suitcase Mom, are you throwing me out because the extra key has gone missing?! Silly you, it's Wednesday What? The Salamandertrip... Did you forget about that? Mom, can I please stay home? Nonsense, you're going to sleep in tent with Jason out in the dark and dangerous forrest. It's going to be fun I don't feel well. That's probably just some hepatitis You just have to walk until it goes away Please let me stay at home?! Then you have to ask your dad first Dad...? No Sten we're taking the back seat Definately Good morning Terkel Good to see you Do you have a note from your parents? Yes, here's my contactbook Would you be so sweet as to deliver all your luggage to the busdriver over there? Is this some kind of joke Terkel? If so I don't think it's funny "You're going to die!" (written) You're going to die? Yeah, I can read it perfectly well myself. But I don't think it's funny Ready to go kids Terkel are you coming? Hey fuckface, come over here and sit your ass down before I make you Hey Jason... Hey Terkel. Cool bag Yeah totally cool bag Is it army? Is it a bag from the army? No, it's just an Eastpack Totally cool Yeah What was it you called that Dorit? Fat cow? Ah yes Fat cow, way cool Terkel.. won't you sit next to me and Saki? Ermm, okay cool What the fuck... Is anybody sitting here? Actually someone is! I can't see anyone Well look closer then, you bum Bloody hell! Now I dropped my pipe You bring bad luck Calm down for a sec? You silly little mischiefs Okay Gunnar I feel like playing a song for you guys If you would like to hear one? Oh dear, you're absolutely uncontrollable Hey Gunnar, can't you sing a song about why we have to do so much homework? Listen up kids, you're all being spoiled There's actually a lot of children in the world who are worse off than you. Nah, I don't believe that Just pay attention: "Here's a story about a boy named Quang" "He's 7 years old and lives in Thailand" "And his workday is long" "He gets up early in the morning" "And goes to bed very late" "'Cause Quang has a lot to do" "Though he's just a boy" "Every morning at 4.45am" "Quang takes off" "Through hawthorns and thistles" "To a boat at the riverside" "The water is dark and cold" "But the family ows money" "So he dives for pearls" "But mostly without any luck" "So what the hell makes you think that i want to listen to you grumble?" "That you don't like your spinach and don't get enough allowance" "You have fast food and Nintendo" "You have time to sillyness and play" "There's 1000 kids in the world wanting to swap places with you" "Quang he's the oldest one" "Of a family of 10" "He's the one doing the cooking" "When the day is over" "There are enough mouths to feed" "Often it can be difficult" "So Quang has bought a tube of glue" "That they can sniff for desert" "When Quang has put the small ones to bed" "He is dead tired" "But he has to go to the village again" "Eventhough it's night" "'Cause he has a date" "that he arranged yesterday" "With his boyfriend Heinrich Schultze" "Who is 45 years old" "So how the hell can you be telling me that you life really sucks" "Would you please try and see it in a larger perspective" "Think about others than yourself" "Learn from my song" "Remember that you have a good life" "if you don't live like Quang" "Remember that you have a good life" "if you don't live like Quang" Gunnar, I just want to tell you that it's a real shame about Quang ... I'm like, "what the fuck?" If it was oneself, one wouldn't think it very funny And then I'm like "Hey stupid", we have to do something Yeah, and you can I have what you call a sponsorchild from Vietnam whom I transfer money to It costs DKR 140 ($23) per month If you guys give me DKR 5 each you can all help me support the little Philip Jongongong Is he called Philip Jongongong? Well Terkel it's a girl But Philip is a boy's name? Yeah, but down there you can be named whatever you like Yes, kids listen up! When you have raised your tents you can go and explore the forrest You can also go down to the lake as long as you keep a safe distance to the water And then we're going to bed early We have to go to bed at 10pm as we have to get up at 5am to study the salamanders Yes Silas? What if one would like to go to bed at 9.30pm? Shut your freaking ass Silas! Terkel was in a better mood Actually he had forgotten all about the horrible messages Hi Jason What's up wannabe? Take it easy... What's wrong with your head?! They have been on your back for 2 days And then all of a sudden you're eating from their palms. It makes no bloody sense They aren't bullying me anymore. They're actually very nice Yeah, they're totally cool because they aren't bullying you, right? That's why you're a brownnose, or?! Am not Nonsense, fucking sellout! Come on... I guess you're also sleeping in their tent? No... Hey Terkel! Don't you want to sleep in tent with me and Sten? What did I just say? Ermm, allright Is that okay Jason? That's your fucking decision, loser Come on Terkel! Do you really think that we can fit all 3 in that tent? Yeah sure, it's an army tent Come on, you bought it at Macy's So what?!

'cause you're too ugly for me and your mom's a skank ho What the fuck...? Jason had never experienced Johanna that way What a temper. What use of language Imagine that a girl could talk that foul So unbelievable foul "How can one be so blind" "I just didn't get it" "It's just now that really I see you" "'Cause you're a super hot fox" "I've found the meaning with my life" "As a lightning from the sky, what the hell is going on" "I haven't been able to see it before today" "that you suddenly looked at me and said:" "Fuck off!" "'Cause you're too ugly for me and your mom's a skank ho" "You told me without a smile" "What do you want?" "I would do anything as long as you say that you would be my girlfriend" "I love your style" "Damn girl you're so crazy" "All that time I've wasted" "Before I understood that you're so hot" "And suddenly I'm standing here" "Seeing how beautiful you are" "I'll feel down if you're not available" "I can only hope that you'll be my girl" "If you're motherfucking fresh with that then let me hear you say:" "Fuck off!" "'Cause you're too ugly for me and your mom's a skank ho" "You told me without a smile" "What do you want?" "I would do anything as long as you say that you would be my girlfriend" "I love your style" "Fuck off!" "'Cause you're too ugly for me and your mom's a skank ho" "You told me without a smile" "What do you want?" "I would do anything as long as you say that you would be my girlfriend" "I love your style" Sten, what kind of sheet is that? It's nothing! It's just that it looks like something my baby sister... Well it's not! Sten! What's up? It's just him Jason, he's gone mental What's up with Jason, Saki? I passed his tent and saw him making out with Johanna I swear and then i went by and said "buhhhh", I swear man it was just for giggles Then he freaked out and slapped me in the face You're saying Jason hit you? Do you think I'm lying, look I'm totally red on the cheek He's totally sick in his head I bet it has something to do with his sister Sister? Yeah, his sister is dead Hold on, does Jason have a sister?! Yeah Dorit Chubby Dorit, the fat cow is his sister. Or were. You didn't know? Dorit? Yeah. Where did you guys hear this? I went to kindergarten with him He just always pretended not to know her in school It's true Terkel Terkel was speechless Was Dorit really Jason's sister? And without Terkel knowing anything about it Of course Terkel had never been home at Jason's It was as if Jason always came up with an apology As if he didn't want Terkel to come home and... find out ...that HE was Dorit's brother! Was it tied together that way? You really didn't know, Terkel? No I thought that you were best friends? Sten can I borrow your... Ahhh What's happening? What is it? I don't know Take a look and see Yeah, come on, it's your sleeping bag Holy fucking shit that is gross Is it a cat or something? Where did it come from? It's HIM! Who! And then Terkel told about all those creepy messages ..and then in my contactbook it said that he wanted to kill me you know, there isn't a lot of people who know where that spare key lies Crazy shit It's definately Jason I just don't understand it, He's my best friend He's of course angry at you because you made Dorit jump out the window Because I made...? You guys were there too What if he's also planning to kill us, Sten? I haven't recieved any threatening letters Me neither, and the dead cat was only in your sleeping bag Yeah, that's true Terkel!

Where to? He's just behind us Who's after us? Can't we just go for a short walk? Just a short? I bullied Dorit so she jumped, but that was because I didn't want to be bullied by Sten and Saki and then Dorit was Jason's sister but I didn't know anything about that What's up fuckfaces? You can't sleep either? Jason! Don't kill us! What the fuck are are you talking about? Have you been eating mushrooms with Terkel? Mushrooms? Did you kill Terkel?

Hey Sten, why is your sleeping bag wet? ...in the meantime I had recieved some scary messages, and there's the dead cat and then Saki said that Jason hit him. And he then sent an sms, Jason that is, that he wanted to kill me, Terkel that is and now look at the display it says Jason "I'm coming to kill you" Woah Terkel, that was quite a swallow Yeah.

We're just going to have some fun I don't think it's funny Nah, but do you think the poor little spider thought it funny when you sat down upon it... With your pretty jeans, eh? What?! That's what this is all about? You thought you would go unpunished... from slaying a tiny animal? You've planned this right from the start? Correctomundo Right from when you committed your crime, I've done everything in my power to get revenge Unfortunately I had to push your teacher down the stairs and drive over her a few times... ...before I could become your teacher. But that's life sometimes. Did you kill Yvonne? Yes! Your insane! Yes, but luckily I'm not an animal tormentor You can't just kill me because of a spider No I won't JUST kill you I will cut you out in 8 equally large pieces And burry the pieces all over the forrest so it can be absorbed by the earth and in that way pay your debt to nature by manuring the earth You're not going anywhere Terkel!
