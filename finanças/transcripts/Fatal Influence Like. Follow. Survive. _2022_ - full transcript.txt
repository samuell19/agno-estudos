Durga temple, home of an ancient sect of warrior monks, militant renegades, who claim to have defended society throughout history from the malevolence evil presence, born of fire and hatred, known as the Gin. The Durga's eccentric leader, the grand Zel, dispatches platoons of his zealous followers around the world. Their mission, to extinguish the Gin's power of possession and to finally locate the reincarnated soul of their fierce goddess, the eternal Ecajetty. Zel tirelessly searches the astral realm for a sign that he himself must enter the battle. Look. Dinner's almost ready. Okay, mom. Oh, can Gina stay over? Sure, but make sure you call her mom. Okay Mom. My mom's working till midnight anyway. Yo, did you hear about those kids in San Diego who found a body in the trunk of an abandoned car? They were using this new Epifanati app. Oh, really? This isn't real. I don't believe you, you're a liar. I'm not a liar. I already downloaded it anyway. Wanna do it? Not really. Well, we're doing it. Okay, to start it says you just have to pick your distance. But what? How far? You decide. It says 1,000 meters or 5,000 meters. How far is that? I don't know, it's like European. Okay, fine 1,000. 1,000, now it says to close your eyes and think of an objective. What? Like imagine what you wanna experience, okay? Death. - Gina, are you crazy? What, are you scared? Gina, change your objection right now. Too late, see it's already searching for a location. Hey, you should go live right now. No. Come on, do it. Okay, fine, okay. Hey, all my cool cats and kittens. I'm here with my girl, Gina. And we're about to try this new epif... Epifanati. Epifanati app, and Gina picked death as a fricking objective, and now, we have to walk around and focus on death, great. Yo, it says that the location's already here. It's in your backyard. This has been such a great adventure. You've taken me to my backyard that we're already in. I mean, look, the flowers back there are definitely dead. - Stacey? This bush is definitely dead and this ball is definitely dead. Gina? Gina, this isn't funny. Gina? Gina, you're scaring me! Sweetie? Despite a shaky business future here in the US, apps like TikTok and Triller have gained a strong foothold in the entertainment industry. The new app on the block, Claktion, claims to set itself apart from its competitors, offering tools for aspiring filmmakers and storytellers. Ahead of the app's official release, Claktion hosted what it called a content creator's camp, slated to be a week long event led by popular influencer and local celebrity, Chaz Bruce, whose dance videos and comedic creations dubbed #brucegang have garnered millions of fans. A small group of willing creators were selected to come to our city and learn the finer points of making and distributing digital content, all in hopes of gaining followers and fame. Is this all the content created by the campers? Yeah, so much death. Damn. Hopefully Zel can put this right. Praise Ecajutty. What's going on creators? Look, my name is Chaz Bruce. I'm really excited to be one of the first brand ambassadors for the Claktion app. What's up, what's up, Claktion people? Me and Dash just got up here checking out the campsite where we gonna have the campers at. Aye, aye. Aye, aye, aye. - These are protective masks we gonna be wearing, I got on my protective mask. As you can see Dash don't got on his. Yo, I dunno if I'm gonna be able to do all of this mask thing, man, every day, 24 hours. It's about protection, you know what I mean? In the sun, breathe, run, sing, dance with a mask on, I dunno if I'm gonna do that. He don't like protection. That's how he got all them kids now, you know what I'm saying? Baby, I was sitting here thinking about when I used to be a substitute teacher. So, after I take a tennis, I get up goes on over to the DVD player. Put it in, come back, sit down and woo, woo, woo, woo. I sit on something hard and the kids just howl, I mean, they screaming with laughter. I get up and I look at what I sat down on and it's a giant penis, giant penis. Giant penis made outta tape with the testicles and everything. Granny loves you. Granny Love. Hey, Granny loves, love you, Granny. Are you ready for camp? Are you really ready? - I'm ready for camp. Yes, I am. You already know content is key, okay? I got you, I got you. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Granny didn't know what to expect when she got here, but this is something brand new. Yeah, that's why they say youth is wasted on the young. Let the journey begin, but protection first, mm. You know my brand. I need to do a clear reading, right? Boop, the fool. Why did your parents choose that name is what I wanna know. - I dunno, because I'm special. Yeah. All right, let's get it clacking. Wait, bye- Girl, can you believe I am here? Okay, let's see what's in here. Get out of town, girl, Claktion. Okay, I'm gonna take this off. Hello, my name is Nadia. I should be chosen for this camp because I can teach. Wow, just to love yourself, to love your body and to embrace the power of the erotic, the sacred feminine. How to get any girl's attention at a party, quick glance, smile. Look at a friend, take a drink, look away and bring him back. I like your content a lot. Thank you. I think I've watched just about every video. I only seen like one, but that one that I seen was a good one, it was a good one. I can't believe it. I can't believe I'm here. Oh, it's so beautiful. I like to consider myself an intellectual triple threat because I'm blonde and Polish. Oh my God, are you like obsessed with me or something? Thank you. Welcome to the Clack it camp. Let's get it, let's get it clacking. It is getting clacking. Can you hit it one more time? Whoa, whoa! I got a cute little new backpack mini, no. That, oh that's so hard. There was a big spider. Next! Oh. - Oh. - Malik, what's... - Oh. Oh, wait, there's supposed to be an interpreter for you. We dunno. There we go. - Yes. Thank you. What's going on? This is not the interpreter I asked for. - Oh. - I don't know- The one we had, he not here. He'll be here later, though. Okay, so this is... She's like a stand in, this is kind of like a substitute, but you'd be good, right? One time. - One time. Uh! Hey, yeah! Hey guys, I'm Irene Rushing. Welcome to my page, Lickety Split Make-Up. This is my first video, which is basically me playing a song and finishing my makeup by the time it's over. But so, I'm gonna start with one of my favorite songs by Kelly Clarks on, "Behind Your Hazel Eyes". Almost, Irene, almost. Yes, I'm so excited! I got you, boo. - Ooh. - I got you. - Oh, I'm so happy. - How many you want? How many follows you want? I want like 20K. Say less. We gonna do that in- Hey, hey, can somebody bring her 20K? We gotta hit a dance. Throw it, throw it up. Gotta do- Here we go. Hey, whoa! - Every whoa was no. - Yeah. - Every whoa. - Absolutely. It was like whoa. One time, so I'm really afraid of needles. So, I decided one time to give blood. Oh, what a glorious day. It's such a nice day, but I know I'm gonna get so hot. I woke up to seven nurses, like Grey's Anatomy shot. I'm gonna do my best to stay safe. And I'm gonna keep my eyes open 'cause honey, one of these critters jump up outta here, they gonna see Granny run all around this place. So, what I used to get from social media experts is like, pick your niche and go with that. I got started getting a lot of requests from different schools and principals asking me to come to their school. Could you come to my school, could you come to my classroom and it's very inspiring. It's a different kind of thing when you can teach outside in the world. What's up? Welcome! Welcome! Oh, y'all gotta come on now. Y'all gotta- Come on now, y'all here for... Y'all almost don't want no followers. First day, right, we're gonna be dealing with the persona. Persona. Thank you. What's your personality like? What do you do? What do you like? 'Cause your followers wanna see who you are, you know what I mean? - Right, like I just said. Day two. Filming and editing tech- - Right. - Right. I am distracted, ladies and gentlemen, distracted. I am horrible, but for everyone who is out there, you're welcome, you're welcome. Day three, right so- Day three, marketing and publicity. So, this is where a lot of people miss. What other type of copy that you're putting out that's directing to whatever kind of business and is it making sense, right? Do you wanna be like me or not? That's what I'm talking... That's what I'm- All right. The grand finale, listen, we don't got you guys here for nothing. - Right. - After all of that content creation, right, we're gonna turn up. We have special guests. - Woo! - DJ Salad. Eat it fresh. We are out of time. Diddy's gonna bring some of his friends. You lie. Get out. The best content creation. Are we going to the hotel first and like change before we start the day? - Yeah. - Oh, no, we start right away. We have started. Okay, so now that we got everything out of the way, we know how the weekend's gonna go. Let's head down to the field and we're gonna get started with the- Claktion Olympics. Right this way. Claktion Olympics. Oh, you got a problem, man? Actually, yeah. How y'all gonna arrest me for helping run an adult summer camp? They all signed waivers. They knew what they was getting into. Rob, if you want us to help you, you're gonna need to cooperate. Can we get you anything? Smoke? You know this doesn't really look good on you, praying on all these people like that. Praying, I know y'all not talking about what we charging for the camp. Man, these people will pay anything for some new followers, for a little bit of clout, for a taste of fame. Shit, we ain't doing nothing illegal. Oh, you think we give a flying fuck about legalities? Rob, we're not cops. Oh, you're not. How about you take off these cuffs then and let me the fuck outta here? Nah, you're not going anywhere until you tell us who is behind this camp. No one knows you're here. So, we're gonna need you to answer our questions, understood? Now, who put this loathsome camp together? Who put it together? - Chaz. It was Chaz. Shit, if that's all y'all wanted to know, that's all you had to say. You expect us to believe that #brucegangchaz is the one that put this camp together, got the specific individuals together to unleash the prophecy of the doom scroll? The prophecy of what? We know it's not Chaz. Did someone reach out to you from Epifanati? From the stupid app? Yeah, Epifanati is a shadow corporation bent on promoting societal decay through the use of social media communities. So, what that gotta do with me? Well, Rob, by encouraging them all to come here and dehumanize each other by creating this loathsome content, you sealed their fate. That's what it has to do with you. So, I get all of this just for helping people make some stupid videos, having a field day, making up stupid dances and shit? Come on, man. Yes, let's go. Let's go, come on! Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait. I cannot not believe we lose, ugh! Granny was our good luck charm. Oh, well we have Granny. It's not fair! We have Granny. That was great. - Go, go go! - Go, go, go! Turn around there, go, go, go, go, yeah! To the right first. Right then left. So, it's gonna like right, left. Then we go- - Hey, can you get a little bit away. Your instruction and my instruction, same time. Well, can all just follow me since I'm the lead, so. Yes, you're the lead, but I'm the better dancer. I really didn't expect for you guys to have as much fun as you had. Someone who touched my heart, man throughout the Olympics and someone that I felt like I really connected with. I connected with y'all, but there was someone who stand out and come together we're gonna be best friends. So, that's what- See, right there. Yes, Alia. Woo! Yeah, right there. I can't let that bitch keep on winning. What did she do to win? What did she do to win? Like what were we doing? I mean, I want everyone to win. I really do. Yeah. But you know? Now, it's time to kick it in the rear gear. For the rest of the day right here at camp, we're gonna now start using the Epifanati app. Through years of intense archeological research and one serendipitous moment. We are now finally able to present to you, Epifanati. I wanna open up this app and I'm gonna focus on my objective, right? Get out. That's what you gotta do. You gotta make sure you have an objective in mind, focus on that, and then, the app is gonna give me a location. Rob, make sure you... I need you down there. I need you to get everything. Got you. Okay, this is where it's gonna get real nice, okay? Woo hoo! Nah, I need y'all to be with me, right? I need you to get your focus right because after I do it, you're gonna do the same. I'm gonna put in the distance, 50 meters. 50 meters. Focus on my objective. My objective is happiness. That's something that I always push out. I'm always happy. I'm always singing. I'm always dancing. - Okay. Happiness is everything, that's what I'm trying to kick around it all. - All right then. There we go. The journey has started. Now, I wonder how long 50 meters is. What are you saying? The journey has begun. I hope it ain't no long way 'cause like Granny, ain't fixing it be walking no home. Make sure you capture all of that. They need to speak in English. I don't know what no 50 meters is. I have no idea what's going on, but I'm super excited about this. I heard that it's a scary app. Like, I don't know, this is all about intentions and stuff. So, I don't know, but that's Granny right there. Hey, Granny. How many is 50 meters, how long is that? I dunno about y'all, but I'm starting feel good already. I'm starting to feel happy. I see some shade. Yes, sure. It's hot as hell. - I dunno if I feel it. I do. Oh, you do? No, I feel hot. It is. It's hot, but it ain't hot as hell, baby. - It's the sun. It's definitely so hot out. It's not hot as hell. - Okay. - It's beautiful. Okay, geez, very- - The sun is just- - What a beautiful sun too. It gives this light. - Hey. - Hey, what's up? Say hey, everyone. Mm-hmm. Do you do this or this? - I rotate. - What? I go back and forth. No, no, get out. You guys see what I'm talking about? Yo! If you focus on the wall. No way. I didn't even notice. What? This is. This look exactly like the shell I found in my happiest moments was when I was in Hawaii. Oh my God. And I had to stick with me too when I walked. And it just makes sense. This is the type of stuff I'm telling you about, man. Exactly what I'm talking about. When you focus on happiness, you focus on your objective, the app will make sure somehow that it connects with you. And this can happen for you too, right? Whatever your objective is, you stay focused on it. And then, the app will make it happen for you. This is like, this is perfect. I hope you guys are as excited as I am. - Yeah! - Woo! Yeah. Wow! Do it again. Oh my goodness, that was hot. - Do it again! - Woo! Now, it's your turn. Now it's your turn, focus on your objective. Woo! Woo hoo! Okay, it's your turn and what we're gonna do is we're gonna leave it to fate. You guys are gonna come and grab the straw. The person with the longest straw will go first. Start thinking about your objective right now. Come on, brother. Don't be afraid, don't be scared, don't be scared. Don't go rest now. It's pretty short. It looks short. Mine is kinda- All right, hold them up, hold them up. Nadia, looks like you're the- You're gonna go, what do you say? - I need you to focus. - Nadia, seriously, girl I'm not happy about this. I wanted to go first. The first thing you gonna have to do is set your distance. How far do you wanna go? 3,000. - 3,000. - What do you wanna do? 3,000. - 3,000. - What is that, like seven miles? It's like 70. Gives me more time to think. Focus on your objective, and then, when you're ready, I want you to make that announcement to the group. I want to covert everyone and all people to worship the sun as their god. That like that, okay. Okay, girl, whatever you want, honey. I'm good, I'm game. I want to convert everyone and all people to worship the sun as their god. The sun, the sun, the sun, the sun. Are we going? Yes, yes. - Oh dear, here we go. - Okay, I'm here. Let's go, let's see that. Here for a good time. - Did you say how many meters? I mean, the sun. You know this shit getting real, right? I see it. Mm, that Epifinati shit is not a joke, man. Word. Don't you walk in front of me, walk in front of him. Looks like they got a situation. They got a situation. But look, keep everything. Record, this is when we wanna record everything. You understand? Don't stop. Don't stop recording. All right, got you. Do not stop recording. I mean, I am not sure about the whole sun god thing, but I'm intrigued of what she'll find, you know what I'm saying? I mean, I do kind of like, I don't wanna say study, but I read. I read up on the Egyptian gods and stuff, so I think, it's pretty interesting, right? Truthfully, I've got my own set of spiritual beliefs and this isn't very interesting to me. Like this following the sun, I don't find that to be very interesting. So, she wants to convert everybody. She's using very like polarizing language in this way. I don't wanna be converted. I mean, I'm good. Here we go with the sun lady. Well, I guess, she got a point. I don't wanna be converted. I mean, I'm good. Here we go. Ugh. Uh, oh. Shit, oh my God. Good evening, Mr. Toshman. You almost cracked your head when you passed out last night, but no worries. We patched you up and cleaned you up. You all right? - Ugh! Mm. What the fuck happened to my head? Mm, where's the show's family? Where's the boy that his mom gave him to the hospital? They wasn't even supposed to be there. I don't even know how they got there. They didn't make it into the camp. So, you're saying they just magically appeared when one of your other influencers left? I mean, I don't know. I really don't know how they got into the park. Like Rob had a very strict selection process. Whoa, Rob, I thought the camp was Chaz's idea. No, Rob called me and I brought Chaz in. Listen, Chaz has millions of followers and I knew if we had him there, then more people would come, especially Grandma Love, she loves him. So, we put together the camp because they told Rob if we did more, and did a good job, that we could do more. And it's more money like who doesn't want to make- Who is they? Claktion, or the bigger company. Ugh, like Epifanati. So, you all work for Epifanati? Yeah, I wrote the jingle for them. I actually stole it from, but I mean, that's not why y'all are here- People are dead. The family? The boy died? All of them. What? Well, most of them. We did get Granny help in time, but some of them are still missing. The Egyptian woman, you liked her, huh? Well, she liked you. She trusted you, they all did. What? I didn't kill nobody. I can't believe this is really happening. I can feel it. I can feel the energy and it's getting stronger. I broke a nail. In fact, I didn't even break a nail, but the woods took my nail. Well, this is another adventure for Granny. Oh Lord. I definitely should have peed before we went out on this. That's crazy, that's something that I would fall in without even seeing it, oh yeah. She's on it. She is on to journey. Did you just see that? See what? The dog that just ran passed. The dog? Yeah, a dog. A doll, no dog. Where? Just a reflection of them shiny hands. Hey man, I ain't playing with nobody dog. I aint seen no dog. This is strange. This is meant to be. This is all part of the plan. My gym's closed, so I have not done this much exercise in a long time. What is that? What is that? What is this? We found something, we found something! It's an onk. An onk, the key of life, the key of life, right? Yeah. - Yes, let's go. - Wait, who did this? You know I'm Egyptian and you're putting all of this. No, no, no, no, understand. - Who did this? - You found that because your energy brought you to this place. This is not something planted, like this is yours. That is for you. Guys, the god is speaking to us. - What does it say? - We're on the right path, it's the key to life. Yes, we are. Here, get a close up. I'm so excited. Oh my God, you guys are coming, right? What do we think? I'm not so sure. I'm not so sure, girls. But I'm along for the ride because where the am I gonna go? I'm happy for her 'cause we've got some information that- - 3,000. - A clue that we're getting closer. I think, this is real good. I'm like, man, inspired now that she found something. This is nice. Doesn't the art inspire you guys? Yeah, it does, and it has so much cultural relevance here. Wow. It looks like really nice. Oh, yeah. We found something. We found something. We found something. It's a nubis. I don't understand. It's kinda cute. Somebody lost their little dog. Yeah. What does she say? A nubis is associated with death. Oh, death? I dunno. Oh, wow. That's what she said. Death comes like dawn. And you wake up laughing at what you thought was your grief. How the do you die, and then wake up laughing? That's what the I'm trying to figure out. Guys, I'm leaving. You need to come with me. We've gotta get out quick. What? We've gotta get out quick. Guys, guys? Well, I'm gonna go. - No. - I'm gonna just make sure she's okay. One of the members just ran off. She found an onk, a DJ onk or something. And then, she found a little taco bell dog, a little chihuahua and she got scared. Talking about somethings was about to happen with death and laughing in your dreams. I don't know, man, but these members is acting real weird. I'm chilling. I'm down. - We out here. - It's all good. We all good. - Listen guys- - Right? This is what this is all about. They always try to send the light skinned people to do the bullshit. - This is a part of the whole thing. You can't be afraid, okay? Are y'all with me? I'm with you. We shall continue, yes? Yes, sir. I don't know what happened to Nadia. I'm getting concerned now because this is just too much, and we out here in these woods and everything, and she done disappear. I'm worried about her. Obviously, I'm doing great, unphased by everything. I think, it's really bizarre and I think, everyone besides Granny and I should be a little bit more concerned about it. I just don't know where she went. Suddenly, just like me and Granny are really alarmed. I genuinely don't know what's happening and it just sucks. And I feel like the guys, the other guys don't care. It's just like, why don't you care about where our camper, Nadia went? - Yo, yo. - Hey! What up, dog? - Pose. - This is crazy, right? Pose, strike a pose. Uh-huh, can we have a silent moment here 'cause the thirst is real. Black Lives Matter. You can see that all this graffiti here is graffiti covering graffiti that used to be behind. You can see the paints got covered over. You can't see what the other artist did, they covered it up, man, how respectful. Oh my God, you guys, oh my God, it's Nadia's phone. The witch. I have to go to the bathroom, are you okay alone? I'm looking at the art. I'm fine by myself. Okay, great. Okay, I'll be back soon. Okay. She just disappeared into thin air and I just don't understand how in the world she could have just disappeared just, and just vanished. She can't just be gone. It makes no sense. Like it makes no sense. She's just not here. And I'm getting honestly, a really weird feeling about it too. And it's just day one, so I have to get a grip because there's five more days, so. Even disappear, I'm worried about her. Obviously, I'm doing great. I'm chased by everything. No, Nadia's already gone. Can you back up a little more? Got it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, can you bring that one up? Did you just see that? See what? The dog. This place is a dream only a sleeper considers it real. But it was your thought, it was your grief. We've gotta get out quick. How the do you die, then wake up laughing? I'm trying to figure out. - What's that behind there? - Guys, I'm leaving. Death comes like dawn. You can't be afraid. Open this goddam door for me. Hey, hey. Hey, come on. Open the door, you dip-shits. Uh, what's with the suits, huh? Well, although, it's an honor to once again be in your presence, I'm afraid your travels have been for not. We had everything here well- Now, listen, listen, listen. When you speak, you're only repeating what you think you already know, but if you are silent, you just might learn something new, okay? Good, now, Granny Love the Ecajutty is safe. No, now she is safe. I have sent our goddess to begin training with her sisters. This place is not safe. Look gentlemen, you must understand that we, the Durga, must combine the power of thunder with the strength of diamond to defeat our foe, the Gin. You must remain vigilant, you dip-shits. These damn spirits who serve your god can take any form, travel swiftly on the wind, and possess the minds of the innocent and ignorant in order to command them to do acts of unspeakable evil. Yes, usually their actions are relegated to juvenile pranks, but it appears this son of a has developed a taste for murder and suicide. Oh, God. It appears that one who's been touched by this evil is in our midst. He must be confronted. With all due respect, Zel, the little one, Toshman, we believe him to be pure of heart and worthy of our mercy. He is to join our ranks. I have summoned the bull to administer his cleansing. But it appears the real problem, Which both of you have lost sight of, oh God, is him. Surprised? Pathetic. Wait, wait, you guys, wait. You guys, that's the Schultz family. Hey, what's up? We're the Schultz, I'm Mike. I'm Christina. And I'm Tyler. I prank my parents all the time. And it sucks sorta. It sucks a lot. Most of the time it sucks. Most of the time, yeah. - For us. - I mean, we make money off of it, so. And we don't have to give him an allowance. I give you an allowance. Yeah, it's great. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, aren't you guys the Schultz family? - Yeah. - Yeah. I'm like a huge, big... Tyler, right? - Yeah. Oh, my gosh, I'm Irene Rushing, I'm very new, but I'm a huge fan. - Yeah. - And your dad's hilarious. - Love your videos. - Oh my God. Oh, my God and hi. Hey. - Oh, yeah, this is- - I can't believe. - Hey. - What's your name? My name is Tyler Schultz, and I'm a prankster and a gamer on the side. I made a Grinder account for my dad. He's not gay. The people on the app, they keep calling him. He's a bear. I popped open the caps of all of his beers and I poured them out into the sink and replaced it with non-alcoholic beer and put 'em back in the same spot. So, he's gonna have no idea. I sold my dad's car on eBay. I want them to be stressed out. Okay, Tyler, all right. How you doing- - Hi, I'm his mom. - I'm Christine. - That's good, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, Granny. Nice to meet you all. I don't know them. I don't know them. I don't know them. Okay, you fanned out. - I love Tyler Schultz. I will be the first to say it and not the last. That boy is hilarious. Excuse me, what about me? Thank you. Sis. Yo, yo, what's up, Schultz family? Yo, the prankster. Yo, you guys are sick. Oh yeah, RIP COVID. COVID, uh. Hey man, got some great news, man. If you can handle it, we just had a spot open up in the camp. For real? Yo, it just opened up, man. Only thing, it's 500 bucks a person and the spot is yours. Okay, listen, if we do this, it's no new drone. Yeah, you can't have both, hun. I need a new drone. Your choice right now, camp, or drone. You wanna be flying a drone, or flying with the stars, man? Make up your mind, kid. - This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, kid.

We gonna come with you guys. - Okay. - Oh. Hi, oh, yay! - Thanks. - Hey. Do you know what's going on? I don't know them. All right, oh guys, look that was a little bit. A little bit scary, but do not be discouraged, ladies and gentlemen. We left, Nadia left. She experienced something, which honestly I hope all you guys have that same kind of experience. And I just hope that you react a little bit different. Do not be scared. This is why you're here, right? - Right. - Yeah. We're here to get into... And when one door closes, another one opens. We have another family joining us right now. - Woo! - Make a noise for the new family. Yeah. And I'm really excited about... I'm excited for you guys. I am really excited To see who's next. Who's next? Who ready to go? Granny ready to go. - Uh! - Granny. All right, all right. I don't talk about that, I know.

Right now, it's all set, but before we move, I need you to focus on your objective. I need you to really think, right? Really put some focus on it and when you're ready, I want you to announce it to the group. When you're ready, though. My objective is knowledge. I wanna be able to influence this younger generation and let 'em know about my- Ooh, oh wow. Right on- We talking about old school. Amen to that, amen to that. Let that map lead you to your destination you going. Okay. Let's go, I'm excited. Here we go. Let's follow her. Right here. What the... How can I gain some knowledge right here in the middle of all of this trash and stuff. Let me look at this. Now, when I came here, I thought it was gonna be some kinda special monument, or something that I can be proud of. - Granny's losing it. - And I just see a whole bunch of junk and garbage. Just the stress- This is getting intense right now. I don't even... See in my generation- It's getting so intense. We have respect for something like this. This is some of our ancestors brought us here and this is the legacy. I got you. We need it cleaned up. Oh, I can't get it either. I can't even look at this. How can you clean spray paint with Windex? - Sorry. - Sorry. No, you're good. - Thank you for opening it. - Of course. Love their scraping here. Oh, that's great. That's what I'm talking about right there. Thanks, Malik. Well, I was so proud of you guys. You did such a great job and- I'm watching them touch. Uh, oh. Oh, it is a joyous occasion, my friend. - Joyous. - Joyous. You know, it's not very often that we are blessed with such great, great fortune. Yes. Look man, look, look, look, if y'all gonna kill me. - No, no. - Just go ahead and kill me, man. No, no, no, no, no, no, kill you, no! No, no, far from it. Here, where is... Oh yes, now here. Just taste- - No. - No, no, no, no. Yeah, you just taste a little of that. So, oh gosh, I think you're gonna like this very much. There you go. Ooh, swallow, swallow, swallow, swallow, swallow. Oh, it is with great humility and honor- - Humility. - Honor! - All right, that's enough. Cut the shit, all right? Be here, all right? Yes, it is with great humility and honor, we begin the sacred cleansing, commencing with the ancient ceremonial joining of your spirit with those of all the warrior monks, who have come before you. Mm? Oh, I don't want my spirit joining with y'all. I don't know, don't wanna join 'em. Yeah, listen to me, it's not up to you. I mean, you think anybody chooses this life? Ah, God bless us. You know, nature is often credited as our true mother, but we believe an ancient goddess has given us life, huh? A beautiful fertile, ferocious wrathful force. She is called the Ecajutty. - Praise the Ecajutty. - Praise the Ecajutty, yes, praise the Ecajutty. And we, the Durga, are sworn to protect her. Throughout time, she is reincarnated when her careless children fall from her eye forgetting all that she's taught them. But miraculously, she's come again. We have identified her spirit in one of your video makers. She is called Deborah. You're talking about Granny? Granny, yes. Yes. Granny? Yes, Granny. Holy fuck! Yes, holy fuck indeed, yes. Oh, guess what? The bull is here. Oh, did I miss the hat part? Yeah, well we can do it again if you'd like. Is this him? Yes. He's so little. Oh, we never question the mother, mm-hmm, no, no, no. I will leave you to it, all right? Let's go, just go. - Hey, where... Where y'all going? Who you supposed to be? I am the bull, this is your cleansing. Oh, okay. At some point you may feel like you're gonna die, but no one ever does. Come on tubby, let's step it up. Did she just call her husband tubby? Tubby. - Thanks so much- - She got him with the fat jokes. I think, I sense the classic family argument. Yo, when I walk, it's lifting stuff. I'm doing a lot of work just by walking. Just gimme a little bit of a break. Can we have that? Well, maybe if you walked a little more, it wouldn't be so difficult. This is great content, go, keep recording this. - How difficult it is to- Girl, I'm gonna- It's been a while since the last one of these, this is exciting. - I can't imagine it's anything- - Can I hang out with these trees. I think, I'm not even here. Now you're sorry, 1,500 bucks and now you're sorry. Why in public do you always need to do this? Are we ever anywhere else? Our whole life is public now. When he looks at me, all I see is that venom in your face, it's disgusting. Do not start with that again. Uh, the drama. Stop it. What are you gonna do? What does it matter If you're always protecting him? How's he gonna grow up? - I'm gonna just... I'm gonna take... See, they need Granny in their life. Granny, you okay? - Oh. - Oh my God. You all right? - Yeah. - You okay? - I'm okay, I'm... - You good? - Are you all right? - You good? Yeah, I'm okay. - No, no, no- - What happened? No, I just need to the whole team. No, I think, you need- - Are you sure? - Let's go to the hospital. Yeah, her phone just caught on fire. It fully explode... Oh. - You look like you might be burned. I just need to go to the hospital. Hey, bud. Hey. Can we talk a little bit. I just want to go back to the hotel. Can we just go back to the hotel? You know, I think you're right, Wai. I think I'm done. It's time, I'm done- Stop, stop, stop. Stop. Stop it, stop it, stop it. That's creepy. - You literally don't know- Thank you so much. Okay, we should do what we came here to do. - Oh, who paid a lot of money, Alia? Okay, so what? I think paid a lot of money. What is that supposed to me, are you coming for- Cancel her, unsubscribe her 'cause she doesn't care, bye. Go to the hotel. - Bye. This is not a dating app. Chaz, listen, Greg- Stop, stop, stop. Stop, that's not Chaz, stop. Shut up. Chaz, listen- Oh my God. I'm gonna time, we gonna take a break too, man. Stop, that's not Chaz. - Chaz! Chaz! - Stop.

Okay, bye. Oh, you did such a great job- Yeah, I could see it, yeah. Thank you, guys. Oh, yeah, she's not a good fit. White interpreters, you know? She seems like she was very sticky. What are they saying? I don't know sign language. It's cool looking, though. Yeah, look, it looks pretty cool. Man, you right, that guy doesn't look anything like Chaz. All right, so everyone listen to me, I won. And we're gonna stay out. We're gonna do our final Epifanati's for everyone. Chaz left and I really don't think we need him. I kind of got the vibe down, right? I got this. - I'm next to go, but- - It literally makes no sense. I got something setup- Alia, I'm done, let's just do- Download the app. I am ready. I'm ready to go. That's all I'm gonna say. I am ready to go. So, I'm going next. Here's my phone. I am setting out the distance. Let's do 100, 100 meters. And my intention. My intention is I want to understand deeper into the occult. Shall we focus on that? How about that? Freaky things is happening anyway. Let's go for it. Like, is everyone crazy? This is like literally so scary. I guess, I just have to lean into it. Who's scared? Are you scared at home? - Meditate on what your objective is. I hope you're in a safe spot. All right, let's see what I find. I feel a little like bad vibe. No, the magician and string. Okay, this is freaking me out. The fool. They are clearly messing with me.

Yes, whereas, the Catholics wait for possession before removing a spirit from the unwilling host. Yes, we are protected. We have the tools to drive the evil Gin away before it takes hold.

No. No, you son of a bitch. No. Bring him back, bring him back! But it was here in these secluded woods where those dreams met a terrifying conclusion. After just one day at the camp, authorities say counselors and campers met a gruesome end. Nine people are dead with one in critical condition and two others still missing. Those bodies discovered here and reported to police by the man at the center of this story, Chaz Bruce, who authorities say was the only to escape without a scratch. Being hailed as a hero by some, police say he is being considered a person of interest in this case, but is yet to officially be named a suspect. Meantime, Claktion is moving forward with its release, while its sponsor app, Epifanati, has ceased all operations. With no suspects in custody and no concrete evidence discovered just yet in this case, authorities say they'll be combing through the videos posted online, or broadcast live during that camp in hopes of finding any clues as to who may be responsible for this heinous crime. I'm Jeffrey Stone reporting, that's the latest. Back to you. Show me the power of thunder. Hey. - Feel, feel the power. - Hey! Hey. Feel the thunder. Yes, let it out. Feel it rising in your body. Yes. Hey! Where you at, you light skinned mother fucker?
