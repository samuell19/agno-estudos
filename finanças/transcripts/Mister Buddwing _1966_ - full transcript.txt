Eh, what is this? Is that you, Sam? "Sam?" Oh, Sam... And why do you only call me when you're drunk? I-I'm not drunk, I'm lost. What the hell do you mean you're lost? Where are you? Uh, The Plaza hotel. So how are you lost if you're at The Plaza? W-w-where are you, Gloria? I'm in bed asleep. I'm trying to sleep. Oh, Sam, you drive me nuts!

You're not gonna walk in here and find me in bed if that's what you're thinkin'. - Please? - Well... I-I'll be right over. G-Gloria! Gloria? What now? I forgot the address. Boy, you are drunk, aren't you? I-I'm not drunk. It's just... It's 352, West 89th Street. You forgot the address. Boy, that takes the cake. I-I'll be there in a few minutes. Sam? Don't fall under no lousy subway trains, huh? Sam. Sam? Sam what? Budd... Sam Budd. Wing? Sam Buddwing. I've got a name. "GV?" Who is it? - It's me. Ahem. - Who? Sam. Alright, alright. Miss Osburn? Yeah. I'm Sam. Not any Sam I know. You don't recognize me? I never saw you before in my life. N-no, w-wait, wait, wait. I've, I've got your phone number, see? Oh, come on now, mister, let's cut the stuff. You met my husband in some lousy bar last night. He gave you my number and says, "Call her, she puts up." - I-is Sam your husband? - Some husband. We separated. He tell you that? Well, no, I don't remember meeting him. Were you out drinking last night? I-I don't know where I was last night. I woke up in Central Park. As God as my witness, that's all I know. Well, um... Well, I said I'd give you some coffee, huh? Uh, sit down. It's, it's already on. Be ready in a minute. Alright... who are ya? I don't know. Why'd you say you were Sam? You said I was Sam. - Who gave you my number? - I don't know. But it's right there on the paper, ain't it? It seems to be. Seems hell, it is! Where you from? I don't know. - Well, how old are you? - I don't know! You married? I'm not sure. You're not sure of nothin', are you? Tsk. Yeah, I think the coffee's ready. How do you take your coffee? I missed it. How do you take this? Hey... Hey, baby, what's the matter? Hey, come on now. Wha-what's the matter? Oh, come on now, baby, don't do this. Please, oh, no, this ain't right. Hey, come on now, baby. - I don't know how I take it. - Huh? My coffee. I don't know how I take it. Oh, you poor baby. Don't know how he takes his coffee. Y-y-yeah. Oh, you dumb, lost puppy. Y-y-yeah. You poor baby. Oh, rest, baby, rest. Oh, what are we gonna do about you? You don't know me? No, honey, I'm sorry. Can't you remember nothing? I feel as if there's some kind of tug-of-war in my mind. Trying to remember and then... - And afraid that if I do... - Yeah? - I better go. - Where? Why, I'm not sure... But don't you want your coffee? Oh, thank you, Gloria, thank you very much. You're a, you're a nice person. - Yeah. - I have to go. U-uh, wait! Have you got any money? - Sure. - Oh, sure. Wait! You don't leave, you hear? Wait. Here, here take this. - Oh, I, I-I couldn't. - Oh, take it, take it. Why, Gloria? Well, you're lost, ain't you? So go find yourself. Grace. Grace! Grace, wait! Grace. Taxi? Taxi! Taxi! Follow that green cab up ahead, please. - Hurry. - What are you? You're the FBI. Don't lose it, huh? I get a ticket, you wanna pay the fine? Y-yeah, okay. I'll pay the fine. Yeah, you're all gonna pay the fine until it comes time to pay the fine then nobody wants to pay the fine. Please, it's very important. Where's that broad going anyway? What broad? The one in the cab up ahead. Oh, watch it, he's turning. I see. I see, already. You know, I had a blonde broad here the other day. Gets in the cab stoned drunk two in the afternoon, wants me to take her to Oyster Bay. I say, "Where in Oyster Bay, lady?" She says, "On the water." I say, "Where on water, lady?" She says, "You want me to take your number?" Right away, they want to take your number. Well, she don't take my number. Instead she sits back and relaxes all over the place. You know, what I mean? She relaxes. With her dress right up to there. Singing very dirty songs. I swear, I almost crashed the cab four times. Well, the pay off is, only $28 ride. She gives me a quarter tip. And says, "Mister you never had a ride like that in your life." She starts marching up the front walk. Just before she goes in the door, she turns... ...and she gives me a bump and a grind. Like she was in the Barley House in Union City. Was it worth it? I ask you. Boy, what a business! Vaulner. Edward Vaulner. You're expecting somebody? O-oh, n-no. No. Then I presume you won't mind if I join you? Oh, please. Not at all. You eat a hearty breakfast. Well, I'm hungry. Listen, don't be defensive. You like to eat, so eat. How did he get out? - What? - That nut. Oh, it says he stole a grey suit from the director's office and just left. Umm, he got lonesome. There are more of his kind outside than in. That's a lot of citrus. You're expecting maybe scurvy? No, I'm just hungry. So, eat. Who's telling you not to eat? Oh, watch it. You almost caught me in the eye. The grapefruit, it's squirting all over the table. - Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. - Who's complaining? You wanna squirt a little grapefruit in my eye? Go ahead. My name is Swartz, what's yours? I don't... - Sam Buddwing. - Pleased to know you. You would eat here all the time? No, this is the first. You should come more often. I eat here all the time. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. That's because the food is so wonderful. It's also because I happen to own the place. - That grapefruit good? - Oh, very. Wait till you taste the Danish. It's as good as... You ever been to Miami Beach? Oh, I forget. How could you forget a place like Miami Beach? I just don't remember. Are you Jewish? If you're a Jewish, you've been there. Oh, I don't know. Then what are you? An Arab? What did you say your name was? Sam Buddwing. All the Sams I know, they're Jewish. What about Sam Adams? He probably changed his name. So did I. What was it before? - I don't remember. - Why? - Are you ashamed? - Well, no, it's just that-- A nice Jewish boy like you... Aren't you gonna drink your milk? Well, sure, I...just wanna have my coffee first. So, have it. How could you drink it black, like that? Well, I'm... I don't know. You don't know? How is it possible not to-- Stop digging at me, I don't know, I don't know. I wish I did, I want to but I don't know! Listen, what's the matter with you? Nothing, just, I can't remember anything, that's all. Why don't you go see a doctor? Um... maybe I will. Maybe, schmaybe, you shouldn't put off ailments no matter how small. My brother Davey had, uh, an ingrown toenail. Didn't see a doctor. Murder, believe me. See a doctor. - Hey. - It's on me. - I can pay. - Yeah. Don't I see you can pay? Do you look like a bum? The only thing wrong is you can't remember anything. That's all. Well, thank you, Mr. Schwartz. You're welcome, Mr... ...what did you changed your name to? Buddwing. Where did you find a cockamamie name like that? On a beer truck. Sam... ...don't be ashamed you're Jewish. Some of the finest Christians, believe me... ...they're Jews. Grace! Grace... slow down, will you? - I'm not Grace. - Sure you are. Would you like me to call a cop? Well, no. Why do we need a cop for? You don't need one but I think I do. Didn't you hear me calling you up on Western Avenue? You followed me from there? Well, now, that's impressive. I yelled. I guess you didn't hear me. Oh, what'd you yell? No, don't tell me... - Grace? - But, that's your name. My name is Janet. Goodbye. Listen, you better not get funny. This is a public park, you know. You get funny in a public park and oh, boy... Why should I get funny? I couldn't guess. Maybe you're some kind of degenerate or something? You know I'm not. From Kookesville? - What's my name? - Grace. Janet. You're 19. How old are you? Twenty five. Twenty five? And how many? Who's Grace? I'm not sure. What do you want? Talk to you, Grace. I'm studying. Oh, that can wait. That's what you think? - Hey? - "Greek Mythology"? You don't mind, do you? I'm really trying to study. Sure, go ahead. I can't study if you keep talking to me. Well, who's talking? - Here, I'll help you. - How? I'll ask the questions, you give the answers. - What's the Pleiades? - The Seven Sisters. And what are their name? Alcyone, Merope, Maia, Electra... And Dopey, and Grumpy... And Sneezy, and Sleepy. Stop that. Okay, now, may I study? - I have a better idea. - What? Let's go for a walk. And what happens when I flunk mythology? I don't know, what? I'll hate you forever, that's what. Well, I wouldn't want that to happen. Okay, as long as you understand. When were you born? January 10th. Capricorn, that explains it I guess. Explains what? Umm... never mind. - What's your favorite month? - March. Nobody's favorite month is March. Mine is, what's yours? October. It makes me sad because everything dies in October. Well, then why is it your favorite month? I'm a very sad person. I cry an awful lot, do you? Oh, no, I... I don't think so. I cry all the time. All the time. I see a bird, I cry. I pick up a salt shaker, I cry. My Uncle Dan calls me Grace The Weeper. Now, we just have to make you laugh. - Impossible. - Why? I have no sense of humor. Are you gonna fall in love with me or something? - Well, I-- - You mustn't, I haven't time. Haven't time? I have to finish college then go for my Masters. So, you see, falling in love will just mess things up. Well, wait until you're asked. - You're in college, aren't you? - Yeah, music. That's lovely. Do you play an instrument? - I compose. - That's lovely. Uh, look, Grace. Just because a guy asked you to take a walk it doesn't mean that he wants to marry you. I know. Would you like to take me out or something? - Yes. - When? Saturday night. I live up in Mount Kisco. I'll come up there. We just met, you know. We're practically strangers. - Then it's settled. - I guess it is. - Grace, you know what? - What? No, don't say it. Why not? I'm not ready for those words. I'm too young and stupid. I don't know much about living. I don't know who I am yet. Well, why don't you look it up under Saturn and the tenth house of Venus. Sure, make fun. You're you, I'm me. That's all we need to know. It sound so brave when you say it. But what does it mean? It means that I love you. Why? Why do you love me? I mean, why me? Oh, please, why me? - I love you. - Yes, but how much? I love you more than anything in the world. Well, that could mean anything. It means I love you. Oh, God, how I love you! I love you, too. Why is he growling at me? He's not growling, he's talking. What's he saying? I bet I know. Who is this joker? And why is he messing around with our darling Grace? - Okay, why? - Why not? - She's just a kid. - She's 19. That's just a kid. - How old are you? - Twenty-five. What'd you do for a living? Well, I'm studying to be a composer. Composer. In your mouth, it sounds criminal. Impractical. Have you got private means? I've got $65 in the bank a beat-up jalopy and I'm going to college on a GI Bill. Now, what's with the 3rd degree? Look, buddy, my niece hasn't got any parents, just me. So, if you don't mind, I'll take an interest. - Okay? - Okay. Now, I'll tell you something, buddy. I'm going to marry your niece. How about that? - What? - Yeah. Why don't you talk that over with your dog? Don't leave holes. - Where the hair was? - Where the ears were. Rich man... poor man... ...beggar man... Oh, lovely, what is it? It's the slow movement from my jazz octet. It gives me goosebumps. Oh, God, I love music. Writing and listening. It's better than we are, you know what I mean? I just... love it. As much as you do me? It's the same thing. Eek, it's going down my front. Oh, it itches. You want some help there? I can manage, thank you. My regular barber doesn't have that problem. I should hope not. I didn't know you had a cowlick. I am all kinds of things you don't know about. Yeah, well, I learn. When? Don't rush me. Why not? I'll give in. It's going to rain! Never. Never. Wow! Where did that come from? You got smart with Jupiter Pluvius. Who? And you, a student of mythology. Yike, I'm soaked to the skin. What is it? Bach, "St. John Passion." Come on. I feel like... I feel like praying. Alright. Pray. I don't know how. Me, neither. I wouldn't even know which God to pray to. Pray to all of them. Jehovah, Zeus... Aphrodite, Apollo... - What about Buddha? - Alright. Him, too. Dear Gods... ...of all times and places. Give us happiness... ...growing on trees in a garden. Let my wife's mouth always taste of clover... ...and her eyes keep keep bright with loving. Let us roam the earth, like Vikings. 'France, England, Spain.' La Costa Brava. Greece. Dardanelles. Oh, yes. And Italy. Everywhere we wanna go. And it won't matter where... ...because we'll be so damned happy. So in love. So all you Gods nod your big, white shaggy heads and shower us with blessings. All you Gods. All you Gods. All you Gods. All you Gods! I am Vaulner. I'm the maniac, Edward Vaulner. What seems to be the trouble, mister? What... Nothing. No trouble at all. Well, it looks to me like you're yellin' all over the place. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was being loud. Yeah, well, there's such a thing as disturbing the peace you know. Well, I'm sorry. What are you doin' here in the first place uh, watchin' the college girls? N-n-no, I wanted to sit in the sun. I didn't realize there was a law against it. There ain't. How 'bout, uh, showin' me some identification, mister? I says, let me see your identification. He wasn't doing anything, officer. - Nobody asked you. - Oh, I... I'm simply offering my observation-- Well, nobody asked you for your observation. He's right, officer. I can verify his testimony. Now this ain't a trial. Mind your own business. I thought this was a free country. Now, who asked you? What are you gonna do next, stop us from sitting in the park? Well, what other country you here from, huh? Now, why don't you all go home and mind your own business, huh? Why don't you go play in traffic, officer? - Very funny. - 'Oh, what's the matter?' Is graft a little slow today, huh? Come and arrest my mother, officer. She's a pusher. - Yeah. - Alright, alright. Alright, break it up, now. Go on home, all of you. They're talkin' law to us again Alright, come on, now. Break it up. Talkin' law to us again Talkin' law Law Talkin' law to us again They wanna put us down again put us down They wanna bog us down again They hope to take away our right which is rightly ours They hope to take away our right Now, look, mister, I don't know what you want but I'm stretched pretty thin, and I swear if you don't stop following me, I'm going to hurt you. I don't wanna hurt you, mister, believe me, I don't, but... - Unless you stop bothering me. - I'm not bothering you. Mister, I'm very tired and upset. - Yes, yes, of course. - I-I don't know who I am. I know who you are. Edward Vaulner. - How do you know that? - I know everything. Who are you? God. Well, I don't believe in God. Well, then, who do you think you're talking to? An old nut who followed me from Washington Square. Oh, that's merely a symptom of your condition. It is a well-known fact that crazy people think everyone else is crazy. - But do you think I'm crazy? - Of course. Then you must be crazy. God cannot be crazy. Now what do you want? You must have faith. - In what? - Me. You? You're crazier than I am. There. You do know, don't you? You know you're Edward Vaulner. 'A paranoid schizophrenic.' You belong in the state hospital where you stole that suit. 'If you are caught, you must go back.' - I don't wanna go back. - Then listen and obey. God needs a disciple. He needs you. To preach the Gospel? Run errands and clean house. To earn money. So that God shall be undisturbed in his meditations. That's kinda petty, isn't it? God is petty. To those who are nobody He gives nothing. No, I won't do it. - Listen to God. Listen-- - No, you listen. I'm somebody, do you understand? I don't know who, but I'm somebody. I'm me! And all I need is for someone else to see it. From now on, when you look at me you see me, or you see no one. Don't give orders to the Almighty. Get away from me, get away from me, or I'll hurt you. You try it, you try it and I'll yell that you are Edward Vaulner. And they will come with a straitjacket and put you away. Get away, get away! Help! Help! Escaped maniac! Help! Help! It's Edward Vaulner! This is the maniac! The escaped maniac! Police! Police, help! It's Vaulner. Help! Please. Please help! Help! Police! Police, help! It's Vaulner! Hurry up! Help! Help! Jeanie. Mommy, that man was crying. What will it be? Uh, could I have a glass of water, please? Got trouble? Uh, my head hurts, and all of a sudden I'm seeing double. Bet I can guess what it is. - You can? - Migraine. - Migraine? - Yeah. My old lady gets it all the time. It's, uh... How do you pronounce it? Psycho... Psycha... - Psychosomatic. - Yeah. Like you're trying to put something out of your head and it keeps hammering to get in. Yeah, but what causes it? Oh, in the case of my old lady, me. Alright, already. Sensitivity. I read that like a cornball amateur. "You shouldn't talk like that, mother. "After all, he's not only my lover he's my friend." That was the worst reading I ever did in my whole life. Do you know that my concentration was nowhere? Sweetie, your concentration was groovy and your sensitivity, well, it just flips me out. Oh, you're putting me on, my whole instrument was blocked. - 'Sweetie, you were wailing.' - Grace? - Grace. - 'You know, you're a doll.' Hey, do forgive, I must run. - Okay? Ciao, baby. - Ciao. Hello, Grace. Hello, Seymour. - Is that my name? - Well, it is, if mine's Grace. Hit the road, you spook. Get lost. Pound yourself some pavement. How'd you like it? I beg your pardon? My performance. Well, actually, I was cheating a little. I did play it in "Bachelor Party." - Are you an actress? - What else? Oh, don't tell me you really thought you knew me. - I do. - Prove it. Y-you've got a beauty spot behind your left shoulder. I've got one, but it's somewhere else, and if you think I'm gonna show you where, you're outta your skull. You gave me this ring. Well, I wouldn't give a man a ring with a cracked stone. It wasn't cracked when you gave it to me. I broke it. Say, you really do think you know me. Yes. I thought I was hip, and here I am falling for the oldest line in the world. "Haven't we met before?" It's not a line. I'm Grace? Well, how'd you like to buy your old friend Grace a cup of coffee, hmm? Like, nothin'. Ah, maybe you're lucky. Lucky? So you don't know who you are? Make a choice. Be whoever you wanna be. That's what actors do. I mean, that's why they're actors. They don't know who they are so they go batting around waiting for some writer to write them a personality. We are all impersonating an identity. I've read that somewhere. - So you do remember things? - Bits and pieces. They keep coming back but they don't add up. Label. Those fancy threads you're wearing. Stores keep records of their customers. All you gotta do is look at the label. Yeah. - Zero. - Yeah. Well, we'll go at it scientifically. Like, first, we'll figure out your profession. - How? - Just answer the questions. What's a tort? A civil wrong under the law. What's the maximum penalty for burglary? I've no idea. Well, a lawyer, you're not. What's scopolamine? Some kind of drug. Dr. Kildare, you're not either. Well, who wrote "Gone with the Wind?" Margaret Mitchell. What are galleys? Well, I think kind of like-- Oh, forget it. When a market is bearish, what does it mean? Weak. What's it called when it's strong? Bullish. Now, we're getting warm. What's the current code on AT&T? I have no idea. Well, rich man, poor man beggar man. What's an A&R man? Ooh, that sounds familiar. I think it's, um... I don't remember. That's my trouble. Oh, this is ridiculous. Well, let's see if any of these ring a bell, alright? Uh... white planes? Brownsville? Chappaqua? Mount Kisco? Mount Kisco. Yeah? I can't remember. Old daddy Freud would say you don't wanna remember. Why? You think this is fun being nobody from nowhere. I wanna remember, it's just that every time I feel like I'm getting close... - Yeah? - There's something waiting. Something... I better tell you, it's possible I'm insane. Are you? I don't know. Yeah. Well, I would, I'd like to help you but... Well, you're an attractive guy and I don't wanna get involved. I mean, well, well, you've got your trouble and, like, that's my trouble. - Getting involved. - Sure. - Nobody wants to get involved. - Wait a minute. I'm not some damn stray dog you'd give a pat on the head and send on his way. - You need a shave. - What? One thing I can't stand is a guy who needs a shave. Where you going? Well, find a barber, I guess. - You got any loot? - A little. Well, save it. I know a place where it's all for free. Come on. - You! - Yeah. - Come and get it. - Crazy. - Look what I found. - Oh, yeah. Harry's. I think. Well, a man is handsome. The girl ain't ugly. You'll keep. - Who is Harry? - Was. - The guy outside the theatre. - Tony? Oh, no. He don't swing like that. Oh, Lord, I am so tired of those AC-DC types. Hey, uh, you normal? I don't remember. Well, before we find out for sure I think you oughta know my name is Fiddle Corwin. Nobody's named Fiddle. Of course not. I made it up 'cause it's easy to remember. That's important for an actress. You're normal. - You promised me something. - Did I? - Food. - Uh, first, you mean. I slept last night in the hollow log With the bedbugs all around me But I thought of sleepin' on a feather's bed... Oh, man. That guy doesn't conduct with a baton. He must use a baseball bat. He's a good conductor. For street cars maybe. Well, look who's criticizing. You know how that phrase should go? See, none of that phony rubato. That's the way it was written. Do that again. Go ahead. Rich man, poor man, beggar man, pianist, huh? Not exactly. Lovely. What is it? I think... slow movement for my jazz octet. Gives me goosebumps. God, I love music. Writing, listening... Listen, I-I had a talk with Loomis. That's nice. Who's Loomis? Verve Records, as you very well now. I forgot. Well, brace yourself. He offered me a job. - You've got a job. - I've got a profession. Ha, ha. Why the, "Ha, ha?" You know what I've got to look forward to when I'm a big, successful composer? Maybe six performances a year by chamber orchestras or ballet commission if I'm lucky. A lot of arranging for other composers just to stay alive and funny, the end. I hate the taste of whisky. Grace, pay attention. We're not starving. No, not quiet. Not as long as you keep working. Madam Proofreader with a college diploma. Alright. What did the great man say? Well, he's nuts about the arrangement I did on "Love and Follow." Oh, goody. Love is a lure that one must follow... Now, cut it out. What's wrong with using a talent if you've got it? Exactly. He says the record will sell a million and furthermore, I've picked the singers and he's nuts about that, too. Sounds like he's generally nuts. Well, he says if I come to work for Verve within three years, maybe five I can be the A&R man. What's an A&R man? In the record business, he's God, that's who. Artist and Repertoire. He picks the stuff they're going to record who's going to record it and he makes a fortune. I didn't know you wanted a fortune. You got anything against money? I'd like some. I guess I'd like a lot. Well, then... Depends on what it costs. Okay, so I wouldn't be writing music. Who in this world gets what he wants anyway? Some people do. Well, some people have got the money to do it with. Grace, we have been married four years. We are no further now then the day we met. I don't want this to turn into... I don't know, schlubs. I don't want us to be like all the schlubs in the world walking around stoop shouldered and afraid. The men with mortgages around their necks and the women with their fat bellies full of kids. I don't want you going to a stupid job each day and hating it and hating me. - I don't. - But you will. You're arguing with yourself, aren't you? Because you're not convinced. Alright, convince me. I don't know. I just don't know. I-I bought you something. Where? From GV? Shouldn't it say, "From GV with love?" The love is understood. - Grace... - Would you close the window? There's a draft in here. Draft? It's 97 deg... Thank you. You got a handkerchief? - Honey-- - I'm going to do the laundry. At this hour? Nobody else would be using the machine. You're not angry? You know how much I love you? Well, then what? Are you worried about me? Of course, I'm worried about you, you foolish jerk. I am you. I spend the whole day figuring out what to say to you. What to wear to please you, how to make you laugh what to feed you, don't you know that? I didn't. You come home hollering about schlubs and making a fortune and... Oh, to hell with it. Grace. Did you mean what you said? About what? Female schlubs with their bellies full of kids? Well, I, I sure wouldn't want a baby now. That's too bad. Why? Because I'm pregnant. Oh, really? That's impossible. Well, it happened. Could we sue Margaret Sanger? Don't be funny. I forgot. I have no sense of humor. Oh, dear. It couldn't have happened. Alright, maybe I wanted it to. - Maybe? - Alright, I did. Grace, are you out of your... Why? I don't know. I thought a baby would... Well, something is happening between us. A-all that's happening to us is creeping poverty. And if you think a baby is any kinda cure for that... How much money have we got? Forty-eight dollars. Alright, I can borrow some. Well, we don't need it right away. We have about seven months and ten days. I can borrow some for an abortion. No. Why not? Because I want it. Well, that's settled. I have got to take that job! Not on my account. Grace, we can't have it both ways. I want it both ways. Fine. What do we do with the kid? Throw it out into the street? I got news for you, it's a lousy world outside. There are tigers and there are sheep out there and the tigers eat the sheep. Oh, great! It's a lousy world, so don't fight it, join it. Grow fangs and eat people and sell out everything that's good about yourself. Everything that's, that's decent... Oh, I know exactly what I mean. - You're talking crazy! - No. You are! - I'm absolutely logical. - Oh, shut up! I'm absolutely logical and you know it. Oh, boy. There goes Grace The Weeper. Shut up. Shut up. Grace? Grace! Grace! You damned fool! He smiled at me. That means something. - He smiled at me. - What are you raving about? Oh, you said the world was lousy but he smiled at me. He smiled at you because you're naked under that coat! Is that why? You weren't really going to do it? I don't know. I don't know what... Oh, God! I am so mixed up. Oh, listen, Grace, we're going to make it turn out our way. The way we want it, do you hear me? We're young and tough, why should we be crying on a bridge? What do we do? They made the rules, didn't they? Alright, we'll learn the rules. We'll play it their way. Listen to me, this is me standing here. 'I'm gonna get what I want, and you can't stop me.' - We'll be tigers. - Now you're talking. We'll be tigers and we'll drink blood. They can't stop us, Grace. - They can't stop us! - Please! We'll learn, Grace. We'll beat the bastards, I swear! I am not Grace! I almost know her name. It's on the tip of my tongue. This crazy alarm goes off in my mind like-like a warning. Of what? I can see it, there's a room... ...a door... Something awful right behind the door. There's nothing behind that door. Don't open it! What are you doing? S-someplace I've got to be. - Where? - It's important. There's somebody waiting. Who? I don't know. Well, will you come back? I-I don't know, maybe. Come back! Someplace I've got to be. - What place? - Buddwing... Where did you find a cockamamie name like that? I'm the maniac. Let me see your identification. Beggar man. - I'm lost. - So go find yourself. - Where in Oyster Bay? - 'Bronxville.' It's possible I'm insane. You do know, don't you? - Steady, Ray. - Collision course. - Give us happiness. - Everything dies. Give us happiness. Help! Escaped maniac. - Chappaqua? - Keeps hammering to get in. - Mount Kisco. - Something awful. You don't wanna remember. God, I love music. Lovely, what is it? - A composer. - A composer! Tell me your name! You dumb, lost puppy. Hello? Uh, hello, Gloria. Who is this? I-i-it's me again. Uh, who the hell is me again? I-I was there this morning. Oh, what do you want? Another handout? Well, n-no. It's just that I'm afraid. I-I don't know anybody and I thought-- My husband is here. Hey, you. You wanna be a trophy? You. I'm talking to you. - What did you say? - I'm on a scavenger hunt. I'm supposed to bring back a tall man in a grey suit. What do you say? - Bring him back where? - Oyster Bay. That's an out of town fare, lady. Well, you tend to your driving. I'm just advising you, it's an out a town fare. Do you want me to take your number? Right away, they wanna take your number. Is this a gag? Does it look like a gag? Come on, if I have to drag a man back to that party he might as well be good looking. That's very flattering, but-- What have you got in the bag, your lunch? Whiskey. Good. I picked a winner. I'm sorry but I'm-I'm on my way somewhere-- - I'll help you get there. - By way of Oyster Bay? - Come on, lady, where to? - Oh, hold your water. I gotta look at this list. What the hell did I do with it? Yes. Blind as a bat without my glasses. Can you read it? Don't mind the odd page. It's there by osmosis. You really were supposed to find a man in a grey suit. Sure. What do you think this was? A pick up? Give me a cigarette. I'm sorry. I don't-I don't smoke. Hey, gimme a cigarette. I'm a cab driver, lady, not a butler. What his number? I can't read it from here. 706143. My name is Fredrick Calabrese. Does that answer your questions? I don't wanna ride with you. Here. Pay him. - Me? - Two and a quarter. Pay him, pay him, but if you tip him a penny, I'll brain you. Better watch yourself, mister, that's a real fly babe. Hey, you did tip him. Well, you were pretty rough. He should've tipped me. He never had a ride like that in his life. He, he, he. Hey, what kind of booze you got there? - Scotch. - Oh, lovely, open it. We'll have a drink. I told you I'm suppose to be someplace else. Oh, the beast emerges. Good, I love bestial men. Come on, give me the bottle. Oh, come on, come on. - Hey, you better go easy. - Oh, why? I go hard or easy, anyway I want to. Cheers. Ick! I hate the taste of whisky. Well, what are the other things on that list? Not the man in the grey suit. I've got him. Well, the first thing is a, a $100,000 in cash. Oh, easy. Uh, I guess they mean play money. No, I guess they mean real money. What's next? A black Cadillac sedan. Easy. We'll call Gary Cadillac and charge it to my husband. What's next? We still haven't got the $100,000. Oh, stick with me, honey. Everything's easy. Uh, your name in the newspaper? Easy. The Penny Arcade on Broadway. What else? Three good men and true to testify to your character. Three men to testify to my character? We better make it yours. Oh, forget it. I'm not going with you. Oh, now, why not? Look what that list offers. Fame, fortune, adventure, romance? Hm-mm. Where's the adventure and romance? Me. You're not on the list. I'm better than on that list. I'm here. Feel that? It's me. Got any more problems? Yes. I don't know who I am. Oh, it's identity you want, huh? Well, identity's a $100,000, a black Cadillac a beautiful blonde in your arm, your name in the papers and three lackeys to tell you how great you are. There, it's right on your list. Your list. Mine, yours, same difference. Atta baby. Well, let's go get that stuff, hmm? Excuse me? Take us to the Penny Arcade on Broadway. Thank you. - Ever been there? - I don't think so. - Ever been to Grant's Tomb? - Nope. A born New Yorker. Ever been to the Queensboro Bridge? Bridges. I don't like bridges. I almost jumped off one once. - Why? - Oh, feeling blue. - Why? - Why? Why? Why? I was a kid. Centuries ago. I'm interested. Well, I was a little bit pregnant and it wasn't, uh, how should we say convenient to have the kid. So instead of jumping off the bridge, I got rid off it. Went to a butcher with dirty hands and that took care of the next generation. Are you married? Yes. What's her name? Grace. Pretty name. Hey, I'm getting sober. Where is the bottle? I like you better sober. Nobody cares whether you like me or not. - Give me the bottle. - No. Oh, my. A difficult man. When were you born? January 10th. Capricorn. It figures. Not that I believe in that stuff anymore. What do you believe in? Nothing. Not the stars, not God, love or marriage. Nothing but the loop we're gonna win tonight with this Cadillac wrapped around us. - Wait right here. - There's no parking sign. Good, it'll make a nice decoration for the party. - Rip it off. - Me? Sure. Live a little. Hey, my friend wants his name in a headline. Write it down. No more than 25 letters. - Pages count in letters. - How long will it take? Half an hour. You can wait or come back, either way. You think we could make a 100 grand in half an hour? Only way you could do that is I was to run it off on this press. - No, we need real money. - That's a lot of loot, lady. Not if you're lucky. You lucky? This stud in the grey suit's my lucky charm. - You want a newspaper or not? - We want it. Now, what shall we say? "A couple caught robbing a bank?" That was more than 25 letters. Why don't we just say I've been a success or something? Yeah, just say he made it. So and so makes it. - Say what's your name? - I haven't got one. Well, every man's got a name. I'm not every man. How do you know? There! How's that? I'm not every man. I'm me. Well, who are you? Nobody. Hey, that's more to the point. Poetic, but untrue. We are going to make it. We'll be back in half an hour. What kind of a headline is that? What are you, a printer or an editor? Come on, let's make a hundred grand. "Nobody makes it." Hey. You serious about that loot? Why? You know a bank some place? Banks are for puttin' in, lady. - Yeah, what's for taking out? - Crap games. Life's the biggest crap game going. Me, I don't dig symbolism but if you're looking for a real crap game with real money... I've got 36 cents. It'll never get you into this game. Will a 100? You figure to parley one bill into a 100 grand? Will there be that much money in the game? It's there if you can take it home. Fine. What's your cut? Win a hundred and ten, I take home ten. You really do think we're gonna make it. I think you're gonna bust that game wide open. How come? Man, when you're born black you never know the smell of luck till it comes sailin' down Broadway sweet and cool in your nose. When you two walked in I got such a whiff, it nearly knocked me down. I'd like my share. You're on. Where is this game? Up in Harlem. You ain't a segregationist or anything? Yeah, I sure am. I wanna segregate all that money from its rightful owner. - Well, let's get to it. - My name is Hank. I know you husband's name, 'cause you wrote it out. But I don't think we've had the pleasure. Just call me Grace. A 100 grand a 100 grand A hundred lousy lovely grand How do you know we'll make it? Because we needed to win. What do we get when we win? The right to keep playing, that's all. The right to collect $200 every time we pass go until we're bankrupt. You can't be bankrupt if you win. You think not? Then what? Then, out. We pack up our pretties and trade 'em for the Queensboro Bridge. Hello, Grace. Welcome home. Where have you been? Ooh, up, down, around. I had to leave the party alone. I looked for you and you were gone. Oh, lovely, let's make a song of it. I looked for you and you were gone I looked for you... Cut it out! Would've sold a million copies. Alright, who was it this time? I didn't quite catch his name but if you'd like a description... Don't touch me! That'll make me the only man around who doesn't. Oh, right. There's a name for woman like you. Say it and while you're on the subject think of one for yourself. Such as? Well, sir, when it comes to a quick roll in the bushes I am not the only half of this-- Take your hands off me. Let go... Oh, God. God, look. Is that us? When did we start to look like that? I think a long time back. Why? What did it? Was it the job I took? The baby I killed? Oh, look at them! Mr. and Mrs. Cinderella, the American dream. - Oh, Grace. - We're dead. It's my fault. Not yours. Nobody's. That's the awful thing. It just happens. Do you remember how we first met? Washington Square. That day at the beach... I gave you a haircut. And that night we were married... ...we prayed. Was that us? We're still young. We could go back. - Oh, we can't go back. - We could try. Well, million years ago, we're dinosaurs, we're extinct. Don't say that, Grace. We've worked too hard. Won too much. We've got everything. And somewhere down the years we've lost the only thing that mattered. Alright, we'll have it back. I swear to you. You're still talking. Why are you still talking? You're damn silly fool. We're dead. We're dead. We're dead. We're dead. - Here we are, folks. - Good! Let's live. Let's go. Roll 'em. Eight. Eight is the point. - Let's go - Eight right back. No, six. Come on, we're hot to trot. Seven. - Shoot at 50. - Here it comes. Go steady here.

Three hundred, she's right. Come on, baby, come on. - Twenty dollars. - Four hundred repay. - Let it ride. - Four hundred. Come on. Come on, you buggers now you pass. Hut, hut! Eleven! Let it ride. So far so good. Where's the heavy stuff? For very big bread. A pusher. Works a lot of high schools in the Bronx. And that one, seen him roll quarter of a million. - He's loaded, too. - Present. Twelve hundred. She's wrong. - I'll take it. - Fifty. - Five! - Five! Fever me, babies. A little fever for momma now, huh? Seven. Oh, well. - Your dice, lady. - Okay, fat man, here you go.

Six and a one. - He's doin' it, Grace. - 'Easy, gimme the loot.' Four to one, he don't seven again. What are you betting, blondie? I bet the 4800. You don't leave no room for error, baby. - We can't lose. - Oh, do tell. - A 100 says he passes. - Fate is coming. - I'll take three. - Cover me? - Make it hot. - Eighteen. - Roll 'em, roll 'em, will ya? - Yeah. - Give me a seven, dice. - Seven, seven, seven. Seven! Seven! Seven! Nine! We've got a hot shooter in the game... Oh, shoot them babies while they're hot, come on. What do you want me to bet now? - All of it. - Hold it. - Put part on 11. - Why? - I've got a feeling. - Okay? Okay with me. Seven to one hundred, he's right. You're faded for five. I'll take twenty-one. Twenty-five hundreds, he elevens. I'll give you a fifteen to one on that. The right odds are seventeen to one. Oh, boy, we got an accountant in the house. Well... You know eleven's a one shot bet, don't you, lady? She knows it. Come on, these dice are coolin' off. - Your cover, lady. - Talk to 'em, talk to 'em. Gimme now eleven, dice. Gotta keep winnin' to stay in the game. - One bill says he does. - Fifteen to one. You heard the man, 17. Okay, one bill, 17. Can I roll these damn things now? Give the man his eleven. I want an eleven. Eleven. Eleven. Eleven. Eleven. Eleven. Eleven. Eleven. Eleven. Yeah! - You made it. - How much have we got? Just a minute. Oh, baby, I got me enough money to choke a horse. Buddy, you sure been living right Don't let them babies cool, honey. - 'Roll 'em. Roll 'em.' - How much? How much? - Fifty seven thousand. - Bet it all on the next roll. Hey, go slow, man. If we lose that, we're out of the game. Yeah, if we win it, we're out of the game, too. - Go. - Come on, big rollers. I'm offering 57000, we'll fade it. Come in here with one bill and you're bustin' up the joint. That's gambling, baby. - Now, you fading or not? - I'd take ten of it. - Ten for me. - Thirty seven open. In or out? First, I'd like to have a look at them dice. What is this? A TV show? I don't know what kind of a show it is. I only know you've got 42 grand off me on that last roll. Now, maybe that doesn't give me the right to examine those dice where you come from, but on my block, it buys a look. - Show him the dice. - Alright. Just don't cool them off. Just wants to make sure they aren't too hot. What do you think? I think 57,000 calls for a new pair of dice. It's the shooter's option to change dice. Not if they're crooked. Those dice were in the game when we got here. If they're crooked, they're crooked for you, too. I know guys to the bottom of the river. Oh, you and your guy to the bottom of the river. - Give him the dice. - Come on, give him the dice. Yeah, they're straight, let him shoot. There's your three good man and true. - In or out? - Roll 'em. Gonna cover me a thousand. - Come on, baby. - Let it ride. Come on, dice. - The point is ten. - Easy, everything's easy. - Two to one, no ten. - I'll take that. - Five on any craps. - Eight to one, I'll take 50. - Eight to one, or hot. - How much? - One bill. - One bill, your cover. Come on, baby, we want a ten. Roll 'em. Roll 'em. - You alright, man? - Sure, he's alright. Roll 'em, baby. Give it to 'em. Go, man, make them babies behave. Come on, ten! - Eleven. - Wait a minute. Can I talk to those dice? - Sure, talk to him. - Hold it. Are you rolling or is he? Oh, he is. Well, then leave the dice alone. I just wanna talk to them. Let her talk to 'em. How do we know she won't pull a switch? Where would she hide another pair of dice? Oh, you tell him. - Talk to 'em, honey. - Come on, ten. That's all we need. Just one more ten. - Come on, ten. - Come on, give me the dice. Come on, make my ten and go. - Here, I talked to 'em. - Okay. - Now, make it. - The hard way, honey. Two sweet fives. Come on, roll 'em, roll 'em. Alright, ten, baby, ten. Give me a ten, give me a ten! Now! Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me. You did it! Baby, what's the matter? Not Monument, Mount Kisco. This telephone number. It's the hospital in Mt. Kisco. - Hey, baby, where you going? - Home. Oh, you can't go home. Don't you know that, baby? You can't go home! Dan? I-is she alive? Barely. Will she live? Who knows? Dan, look at me. You're disgusting. Who called the hospital? Are you kidding? I don't remember. You did. Then what? What are you, playing some kind of crummy game? Tell me. You disappeared. When they got to the house, it was open. Nobody there but Grace, lying in her own... Where the hell have you been? Where the hell have I been? You mean, who have I been? Dan, I want to see her. No. You can't stop me. I will. I will. - And if it's necessary-- - Dan, Dan. I'm begging you. She's not conscious. Any way. I'll go see. Oh, dear God. Let her live. Let her live. Just for a moment. Thanks, Dan. Grace? Oh, Grace.
