[Applause] [Music] [Music] this evening from Hamburg in Franconia the noted surgeon Rudolph Swartz has completed all laboratory tests with his anti lymphocytic serum the serum is to prevent organ rejection after transplant operations professor Schwartz declares he's ready to use the serum on the first transplant case brought to him Berlin [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the bomb lucky no one was with him he's got a chance give me him at this stretcher will ya now be careful how you moving easy easy now let's get em to dr. Schwartz quickly right all right pick it up [Music] evening inspector what is it woman found murdered what have you brought in an accident case the patient's ready dr. Schwartz they're eight o'clock tomorrow right professor Carl I'll be all right don't worry I don't need anything I must just wait I saw professor Schwartz on my way in you know he has a new serum he's developed and if he could use it on you everything would be all right you'd hear that Oh Carl that would be wonderful and everything will be all right but what about your work doesn't the editor need you down at the paper no problem we never finish I'm now chief reporter crime newsdesk hello how are you feeling quite well professor very well I don't feel ill not sick at all why that's first-rate well I've got some news for you we found a donor but that's a when when can you do it no we have to my assistants are here to prepare you in no time at all you'll be able to say you've never been sick it's wonderful yes it is I wanted to tell you the donor was just killed in a car accident the wife has given me permission to take the heart all the preoperative tests are nearly finished I see my sister is in your hands professor the best my poor hands can do a lot but they can't perform miracles are you telling me there's a chance she might not survive the operation chances for your sister to live without the transplant are very few I don't doubt but what she'll be quite able to survive the surgery but that's not the problem the problem comes after you mean probable rejection of the heart yes we have to operate on two people genetically different it's not the same as with members of the same family but perhaps we might avoid this danger we do have a chance with this new serum you've recently discovered yes my discovery has proven we can modify the morphological picture and avoid rejection I've had excellent results on animals in all my laboratory experiments and now I will be able to prove it for the first time on a human beings should your sister just sign this authorization I need your permission professor you have your authorization you're performing a duty to mankind here it is the Schwartz serum is the only bottle of anti lymphocytic serum existing in the whole world [Music] [Music] maybe a little too late for the liver and I've got to try [Music] I increase the concentration in the DPS [Music] now the government [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] apart from Fritz no one has access to this room but myself the serum was stolen year's work of a lifetime gone and my sisters did we did all we could with the usual treatment and without the operation she would have died I know that but I can't help thinking the serum could have kept the heart from being rejected at least if we'd had it might have slowed down the process professor Schwartz I've got to find out who stole it if that's what you want I can authorize you to go about it any way you feel you have my permission to question anybody in the hospital is that Alright yes professor and I'll find who did it you can be sure good luck do you want something sir I'm working on the Swart serum case the night it was stolen who was on duty I don't know where can I find out in the personnel office thank you laughter who's in charge of records on the school I don't know why don't you ask a nurse in there I'm sorry it's not visiting hours I want some information doctor Schwartz has authorized me to make an inquiry i'm fritz his special nurse yes yes I know I would like to ask about something that involves the professor the serum by me oh yes poor professor Schwarz his whole life has been the serum now it's been stolen we informed the police about it yesterday well is there anything you can tell me in what way can I help you alright then Fritz could you tell me who could be wanting to steal a serum that's only for making transplants nobody ought have been it had never yet been tested on human beings I already told the police that there was one thing peculiar I thought oh there was this smell an odor a smell I didn't tell this to the police but maybe it could be useful yet on the other hand it could be nothing let me be the judge of that I'm trying to help a professor and find out who stole it for the future of transplant operations what was the peculiar smell aldehyde a formic acid HCHO HCHO formalin yes formalin what's peculiar about the smell of formaldehyde normally nothing but I smelled it around the professor's refrigerator and there's no reason for the odour of formaldehyde to be in there I'm sure of that so formaldehyde is a substance used to preserve specimens and dead bodies it's a smell that you always find around anatomy laboratories and morgues - what do you mean I don't mean anything except there is no reason for that odor to be in professor Schwartz's private study it's just not usual I see Thank You fritz here's my card you can reach me through the office at any time if you think of something else Thanks [Music] oh good evening sir what can I give you and goods to me Oh some liver I'll get it for you [Applause] [Music] Oh what-what are you doing do you get your hands off of me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and what's Whitney have you read what's written here mm-hmm it's all perfectly correct I think so my name is inspector honored Schneider notice picked up all know Snyder my name is written with an A nothing oh and hey do you understand yeah what did you type this report idiots me that was a rhetorical question a rhetorical question never requires an answer yeah don't you even know that here take this and proofread it hmm I got an even temper and even when things go wrong like this Strauss I keep calm and now for you Jim anything new in a married women here's the coroner's report on just give me the essence of the thing the juice you know well the first had been strangled the weapon is steel wire the body had been opened with a Lancet and the liver taken out Phil use The Lancet The Killers not a doctor his cuts are like an amateurs what about The Lancet normal answer chief we are trying to find the manufacturers well trying to find them quick will you yes sir got to quiet my nerves I've got the light for you chief it smells smoky not in this office no one you're here not until we've solved these murders orders orders what I want to know who the manufacturer was of that Lancet and who it was sold to - I want the Hemet illogical examination the blood spots under Lancet and the blood spots on the ground so we can find out if they came from one in the same person for I mean three I want to get more information on that shopping bag found in the vicinity of the woman cut out by that Lancet for a complete life story of the victims and five I want to know what was said in interrogation by the first woman to discover the cut up corpse and no one's told me dammit think about houses [Applause] continual lowering of blood glucose level is well below 35 minutes after successes but no change instead of Emily's check on right Ghana transplant perfect integration of Kraft sexual persons increased left collared incident rejection rejection if you don't behave I should destroy you the same as I have made you you've got to stop killing I'm the one that'll get you the organs you need what do you know about such things you must obey me mosaic I need you not perfect you I've stolen dr. Schwartz's serum for you and if it works you'll need no more transplants so be patient you hear today the 30th of March observed the almost total absorption of the transplanted liver interrupt the flow of the portal and the inferior cava venous pressure in the portal will shortly go over 60 millimeters h2o drainage functioning well hydrocortisone in glucose infusion adequate to knead electrocardiogram valid encephalo gram waves present I begin the transplant anastomosis of suprahepatic veins to cover sutured with a traumatic head the territory dissection of scrotum money I begin the testicle transplant ligaments your child and now I should perform an action will be a milestone in medical history the first experiment with Professor Rudolph Schwartz's and her lymphocytic serum for the Prevention of transplant rejects in human being [Music] [Music] good evening I'd like to talk to dr. Frankenstein my uncle's not in now if you'd like to leave a message I'll see that he gets it I'm sorry to disturb you miss but I'm a reporter my name is Karl sure if you'll tell me when I find him

mm-hmm thank you hey by the way have you seen my boyfriend here he's been roaming around with another chick [Laughter] Hey music I knew where I find you when I saw you taking my money I knew what a woman you must stop this getting a tip not over this Shanaya yeah what the two sets of fingerprints on one hand it's impossible oh man chief we got the lineup going on but that blonde hooker still can't identify that man she was running away from and just to make things better that was a distinguished gentleman who was also looking for this brute that night inspector what a load of crap Pato you're right it's exactly that you want to hear what fingerprints just said about the lancet that was used for that first murder the fingerprints you found on that pretty Lancet correspond exactly to the fingerprints that were found in the horse bag chief well that's a step forward we're getting there no it's a step backward but the fingerprints on that bloody Lancet have two kinds torn the very same hand but our chief no the murder of the shopping bag woman was executed with a Lancet that had two sets of fingerprints on it I mean the fingerprints of two different people belonging to one in the same hand one prostitute refuses to go with an ugly bastard who goes off with another and then in this girl's room the identical finger prints turn up once more and now we hear that there was a distinguished gentleman out there looking for that same ugly son of a [ __ ] to confuse things spend for the ulcer come on I see that the murder of this prostitute is getting a big play in the papers I only wish a reporter could be more useful the police are still in complete darkness people are asking what's happening a wild killer a maniac perhaps at this very moment telegram for you Thanks sit down now now listen to me carefully there are many scattered pieces concerning this puzzle and if we're going to try to understand it this mosaic we've got to put them together piece by piece huh now listen to me a a special anti lymphocytic serum has been stolen I feel sure it all begins from here be formaldehyde is smelled where the serum was stolen see a woman is strangled with steel thread D a surgeon's knife a Lancet is used by someone who is not a surgeon Eve fingerprints a and B on The Lancet two completely different sets of fingerprints two murderers one of them inserts The Lancet one of them cuts that's not probable F a [ __ ] raped and strangled in her house G here we also find fingerprints a and B [Music] there's a reporter out here to see his name is Shirin send them away quick maybe you should see him he says it's important I don't want to see in the reporters send them away you better not try to avoid me inspector I think I can help you with all those crimes oh you can can you and what way first I want to talk about that serum I think the murders are connected to the theft evening stress hi how's the boss talking over new ideas as someone you mean the bus has some ideas no new ones lately but if he doesn't get this solved nobody's gonna smoke we just go on with a lineup turn I guess so I better get back check come in this is Chows my top man now why don't you ask him the question that you just put to me I want to know if you smell formaldehyde in the prostitutes bedroom well now that I come to think of it I do remember smelling formaldehyde well I recognized the smell right away I may be wrong but this might be the most important clue I'm glad you came sure it's good for my complexion is [Music] oh hello there is your uncle it's not but I'm expecting him soon would you like to come Zack wait Thanks [Music] what you ever seek there anything I can do to help it's necessary I talked to your uncle to tell you the truth he's not actually my uncle you seen he's my guardian and he brought me up back team brought me into this world it's been like a father since my parents died you must be very kind might I give you any information you need no I'm afraid not I'm at the technical information I'm studying medicine they should have to know I'm not an MD yet but I'm preparing all my finals that's beautiful ending its transplants I'm interested in are you doing an article on them I want to find out why some organs are rejected after a transplant if you're riding on dr. Barnard my uncle is lots of books in this library on the subject you can use them if you wish it's strange I should think work of an anatomist they have nothing to do with transplant it's not so strange my uncle otto was once a surgeon but there was an accident you see forgive me miss what accident Sonia is what everyone else calls me alright Sonia so tell me what accident Oh politician's wife he was operating on who died that ruined his career now he's pathological anatomist at the hospital works only on cadavers with no risk yet he's so changed he's not the way was tell me about transplants doctor they're nothing they began with dr. Barnett's work but today the commonplace throughout the world the most important facet of this operation is the the danger of the possible rejection which could be solved by the new serum but why talk of sad things like that medicines full of cheerful subjects it's not just organ transplanting and just to give you an example I'm studying to be a pediatrician you are oh yes I like children very much and do you like reporters nosy I'm not too nosy I will drink to that to the Future children of the world Thanks it's nothing the police have discovered that Lancer that the murderer used um you know that woman we read about in the papers yes they've also discovered it was sold to this hospital and they want to know to whom it was assigned do you know do you I've personally checked the inventory have you told the police about it no I wanted to tell you first I've many of them maybe someone stole one dr. Frankenstein the question is to find out who stole it it may very well be the same one who stole my serum [Music] [Applause] [Music] it came from here what's behind this bookcase I have a private lab a private lab I want to see it do something to stop your bee [Music] [Music] today I perform the iya transplants donor professor Rudolph Schwartz slight disparity in size between the donated organs and the recipients orbital cavities [Music] come in excuse me dr. Frankenstein but he want have you seen professor Schwartz but look here because he said he was coming to speak to you about something maybe he changed his mind excuse me if I disturbed you you didn't [Music] a few days we'll take the bandages off do you hear me there's a little job to do me and for you fritz that male nurse in surgery has become a bit suspicious when I tell you to go over to the ward and get him you hear me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Trishna male nurse is not a pack of cigarettes he's bound to be in there somewhere right so find him Angeles has happened inspector I know it's you always in the spot it's that nurse of quartz who disappeared you mean frits yeah no I spoke to him once he was the one who gave me the clue on the formaldehyde how did he disappear a big ugly brute dragged him away according to a patient a patient and he wasn't dreaming we found a piece of gauze that had been soaked with ether it's clear that he was knocked out with it then dragged away and what's more professor Schwartz hasn't come back Janet I wanted to talk to him come with me inspector where to over to the house of dr. Frankenstein the hospital pathologist I'll explain it to you later okay lead the way [Music] good evening miss hello Sonia forgive the late hour is your uncle in I gotta speak to merchant Lee I'm captain Schneider police investigator he's not here would you like to wait inside yes if you don't mind not at all the blood transfusions going perfectly it will be continued under a complete substitution of the blood the crisis is past oh I'm glad there's some gentleman here to see you good evening what can I do for you gentlemen I'm sure ahead a police investigation and this is a reporter it's a strange thing you know Schwartz his male nurse don't you well he's disappeared and professor Schwartz hasn't shown up either they disappeared been so busy working I didn't hear about it yeah tell me dr. Frankenstein do you recall the last time you saw either one of them I've seen neither one nor the other I've been working late in my office even tonight don't forget me why don't you go sit down I'll fix a drink for you we have to be on our way thank you very much miss don't worry good night good night miss good night he said he'd been working late in his office every single night afraid that's not true I was over there tonight hmm what for I was making an unofficial investigation what were you looking for I am I was simply following up an idea of mine but you didn't find anything no nothing and it wasn't in the anatomy stiff room either I looked will you please tell me what you're driving at I don't know I'm not sure yet I'll call you later the transplants negative reactions even the other fingers came from incredible I think he uses his knowledge of medicine to create a monster incredible he's made a man from other people you must a baby mosaic I need you I'll protect you I've stolen dr. Schwartz's serum for you and if it works you'll need no more transplants you're the proof you wanted thank you now sit down there oh no no more horror stories for me we love Schwartz famous surgeon is missing as a strawberry birthmark on his chest the strawberry birthmark on his chest on his chest his chest get me inspector Schneider inspector it's me Karl I've got some new information I practically have a complete confession on my desk here it's almost unbelievable I tell you yes yes I'll be over at once [Music] absence map the one around Swartz's refrigerator [Music] [Music] chief there must be a secret door here [Music] yeah search every nook and cranny [Music] no no no no going there [Music] [Music] get your hands off on the endless mosaic you've now attacked me and I should have to destroy you [Music] [Music] [Music] ha [Applause] I won't even have to kill you your brain is already disintegrating [Music] music what are you doing no stop stop music listen you need me I've made you you here I made you you can't kill me [Music] Sonya chief you better look in there we're too late the finger transplants had had no negative reactions even though the fingers came from two entirely different subjects so that's the reason why the murderer had two sets of fingerprints organs we have still other tapes we don't have to listen to them now what's important is capturing that monster or maybe a man because he's not a monster he's a poor human creature who's made up of pieces through a technique we'll never be able to discover the real monsters that dr. Frankenstein oh sorry but from what we've gathered from the tapes we have the answer there are 36 to 48 hours before the monster as you call him will die of rejection of the brain we'd better swear out a warrant for his arrest whose arrest how can any one swear out and the rest weren't against someone who doesn't even have a name all we can do is to keep every man on his toes until the bloody creature dies and 48 hours without a smoke and he'll go on killing whenever he feels he's cornered like a trapped animal the poor thing can't help killing and nobody will know where he might attack them it shows us how science can be fully irresponsible the worst monster in history I hope we meet [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now ladies and gentlemen we continue our program with that Great Western it Tucson slam starring Wild Bill Brown [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Titus speaking you hear me Strauss this is Strasse here boss we're patrolling the edges of sectors 6 7 & 8 like you said nothing news cooking alright tonight are going headquarters receiving you come in chief anything new desk chief the strippers been found murdered over at the Winter Garden okay I'll go right over [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] try to hear that's cheap get moving will that grace track murder I want the latest on the idents of those fingerprints right chief Strauss go to sector 6 Sonia it's Carl have you read the papers I'm concerned you shouldn't be alone no I'm rather busy I can't get away now take a taxi and meet me here yes of course we'll eat out bye Tommy bye the hunt for the monster is still going on the murderer of the exotic dancer of the vagabond found in the car dumped and the murder that we have learned that just happened in the toilet at today's international Grand Prix are the work of the same monster police request all citizens to be very careful and to report anything suspicious and now what do we do now just have to wait nothing else to do I'm in constant touch with Schneider he says just wait and be patient oh god I wish all this who were over [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] headquarters come in chief have you got any new leads on the nightclub investigation nothing chief the men are there what do they do now stay there the chief says no one's going home so pleasant dreams [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a couple of been attacked by a monster upon wooden Senate Hamlet's and go over to park woods teeth and our old going [Music] hey Willie we've got a song these woods inch-by-inch he can't have gotten very far yes sir and that's good get moving what do you know here comes Hemingway Carl hey Carl there's no reason for you to be here we'll take care of things hey sprout Carl there's not much to worry about you know monsters time is getting short yes you're right the 48 hours for the brain reject are almost up so why are you going I'm going back to the house son is waiting for me I don't want her to have to worry rector [Applause] Sonia Carl well thank God how about a drink for the both of us all right [Music] [Music] - Schneider Johnson car number seven call me auntie him come in I'm going over to felt a fixed rasa number nine a suspicious-looking character was seen there what's his description it was reported that he wore a big hat and a long coat I don't know but it could be our man they're nine why that's the house of coucher get over there on the double I'll meet you there till twelve and four to get their cars there as fast as they can I'll inform headquarters [Music] night out of headquarters get all the men over to fellow things truss and block old traffic there get a move on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Carla thank God the people across the street colors we got here as quick as he good it's all over inspector you'll make a great top car I've got the life for you chief [Music]
