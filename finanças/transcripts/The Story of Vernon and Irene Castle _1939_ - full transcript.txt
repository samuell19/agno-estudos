You'll never have a next week's salary, you already spent it last week. Mr. Fields, if my next week's salary can make a beautiful lady happy this week... my duty to spend it, thanks. - Here son, keep the change. - Oh, thanks. Say Vernon, if those flowers are for Miss Ford, you're aiming too high. - I'm having supper with her after the show. - But you haven't got the right ammunition. - The what? - Spondoodles, mazuma. Something that you second comics never have. Oh, but someday I'll be the first comic, after you of course. - Oh, thanks. - I'm sure you wrong about Miss Ford. A lot of fellas have been wrong about Miss Ford, and you're next. Look out, she trifles with men's hearts.

Miss Ford. - You're on next Mr. Castle. - All right John. - Will you wear this tonight? - Tonight? - Yes, remember our supper date. - Oh, of course, I remember. But Vernon my head is simply splitting and I should be in bed this minute. - You will forgive me darling. - How about tomorrow? Tomorrow? Sunday?

She was in a school production when she was 10, you remember Hubert? Eh? Oh yes. - Well, here's our dog. - Our dog? I asked all around the neighborhood and nobody... claims him so Sailor said she wants to keep him. - Well, he's very sweet. - Here boy, here boy. - What train you figure on making? - The 5:30. I figure the 4:30. Oh, look... How nice, Irene is going to do a rendition for you. - For me? - Yes. She's never had an opportunity to do it for a professional audience before. I think I'll go out and work in the garden a bit. Hubert, you stay right here. - I think my clothes must be dry by now. - You sit here sir.

You were terrible. Oh, so Miss Irene Foote, actress of New Rochelle thinks I'm terrible. Oh, thanks very much for taking the trouble to come back and tell me so. You could be a perfectly wonderful dancer if you wanted to. Instead you waste your talent letting people set fire to you. Takes talent to make people laugh and I like being set fire to. - Well, I won't have you doing it. - Oh, you won't. Say, what makes you so excited about me? You have something no comedian will ever have and you're wasting it. What other reason could there be? Oh, I don't know, girls... especially young girls sometimes gets crushes on actors. Oh? - Oh, I didn't... - You called me a ham. Well, you're a ham with mustard. Oh, I know what it means. And if you think I had personal interest in coming back here, you're very much mistaken. Wait a minute, please. Don't think I'll annoy you with my intentions Mr. Castle. Just go on, be funny with soap on your face and get to be a first comedian. I thought you could be a first dancer, a very beautiful first dancer. Because you are a beautiful dancer but you're so... smug and conceited that you can't see any further than your funny nose. There. You expecting someone Sailor? Can't a person sit in their own front yard on a Sunday without expecting somebody. I knew he's a fly by night.

Oh, he's just fine, thank you. I thought he might being sick, that's why I came out. - No, he's just fine. - That's good. See, I thought he might be sick and just thought I'd... Come out. My, what a beautiful automobile. - Is it yours? - Just a little runabout. - There's nothing like a good spin. - Makes you dizzy. No, it doesn't Walter. Just I'm not one way or another about it. - Well, I guess I'd better be running along. - Bye. Well, I'm glad the dog is all right. Go on, go on. Go on. Go on. Oh dear... Here Zowie, here Zowie. Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh Zowie, you bad little dog. Sailor, you get down out of that contraption, it ain't safe. Smile... off.

We get two bows we'll be doing very well. If we can keep on like that it won't be long before we can ask Mr. Fields for a trial. Cuba pressed by Spain appeals to Uncle Sam for aid. Niagara Falls. That's quite a place for... I mean, that's quite a place for people to go. - Oh, you mean on honeymoons? - Yeah. Devil's Island, that's interesting too. - Irene. - Yes? Irene, we only known each other about three months. Irene, Irene, have you seen my copy of Vogue? Oh, here it is Mother. - Anything yet? - Not yet. Well, I don't want to interrupt anything. And you were saying that we've known each other for nearly three months. Yes, you see my one aim in life is always been to keep from getting involved. Vernon don't get involved, I've always said. - I mean I used to say. - Well, what do you say now? Well... you know, I think when people dance well together it's because they're... they're sympathetic to each other. In fact, that's part of what I was getting at. Dancing brings people closer together. I don't mean only closer together... Oh, good evening darling. - Good evening Vernon. - Good evening sir. - Hello, Dad. - Anything happened while I was out? - Everybody finished with the paper? - Oh, I'll get it for you Dad.

No, no sweetheart, that's no way to talk, I don't feel so rosy myself. Maybe we're not quite ready yet. - Maybe we should rehearse some more. - And come back next week, eh? - Yes, that's it. - Come on Walter. What are you doing, running away?

Well, all right, let's look at it. - Thanks. - Charlie, put on the front border. You sit here. I hope I don't disappoint you. Come on, you know, chin up, chest out and best foot forward. All right Walter. Very nice. No? Why not? Well now, who's going to pay money to see a man dance with his wife? Look, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give Mrs. Castle a line in the show... and as for you Vernon, next season I'll hand you a whole new scene. - Well Mr. Fields that will be... - Mr. Fields, what kind of a scene? Well, I'll tell you. The idea is that I'm a bricklayer. - Oh, and I'm your helper. - Yes. - You come on with a hat full of bricks. - And you trip me up. No, I shove you right in the cement. - And I'm covered with it. - You clumsy geek, pick up those bricks. Oh, I see. See, he is the one Papa, the droll one. Oh, so droll in the barbershop. Right back into the cement. What's the matter? - I'm sorry sir, I can't do it. - What? Why not? We're going to dance together. - Say, whose idea is this? - Ours. Oh? Well, you know Vernon, as a comedian you're valuable to me. But as a dancer, even two dancers, you wouldn't bring in two nickels. We're sorry Mr. Fields, but we think you're wrong. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're wrong. Now, don't take it too badly Mrs. Castle. We all make mistakes, see you later Vernon. Greenhorn. Do you think it's true, what he said? We can try some other managers. We want to dance and we're going to. I wish I knew where. Monsieur Castle. - Monsieur Castle. - Yes. - I'm Mr. Aubel and this is Emile, my son. - Oh, how do you do? My father and I, we have purchased from Mr. Fields the French rights to The Hen Pecks. And we reproduce the play in the Paris next spring. And we want you for our show. You want... Oh, Vernon darling. A honeymoon in Paris and we get paid for it. - You come? - Sure, we'll come. Oh Walter, I don't know about you. Walter goes with us if it takes our last cent. Sure, you think I'll let you two go alone? Gee, whiz. - Wait a minute, there's the theater. - The theater is back there. Turn around, tell him to turn around. Back there. No, no. Have him wait Walter. - No Vernon, that's too expensive. - Whatever, our salary starts any minute. Hello Mr. Aubel. - How do you do? - Bon jour. Here we are. I believe you telephoned our secretary. - Oui, oui, I am very sorry but it is so. - What? But you told him we were late. - Emile? - No, no. We are late. Nous, not vous. - The play is late. - Au revoir, we see you in six weeks. Vernon, what we going to do in the meantime? We haven't any money. Wait a minute. - Monsieur... - No, no, let me. I'm used to this, it's very simple. Mr. Aubel, could we trouble you for the usual advance on our salary? Au revoir. You don't understand. I mean we're a little short of cash. Mr. Aubel... Please. For you madam, Emile. You will please sign, a formality. Wait a minute, this is for eight days' salary instead of seven. - Interest, you know? - Like a bank. - Oh, yes. - Is this customary? - I guess so. - Our country seems so strange to you. You must not bother about business. You are young and it is Paris, it is spring. Papa. Au revoir madame. Zowie, bad dog, we're so sorry. - I wait. - From now on, we walk. Pay him Walter. And take Zowie back to that fancy hotel and pack. We're going to look for a flat. Bye. What? To you. Au revoir.

For eight weeks have not paid. - Where is my money? - Quiet, if you please. Quiet, quiet, quiet. Must we be subjected to all this brawling? Oh, pardon madame, let me explain. But those young people, I am hoarse from screaming for my rent. You will have to scream for his rent, too, if you don't mind your manners. I've brought him a client who can't stand noise. Maggie. Quiet. Such a quaint place, isn't it? Veritable bit of Bohemia. Really Maggie, these obscure geniuses of yours. - I don't know if they're worth it or not. - I'm sure this one is. Of course you're sure, you get 10 percent of what I pay him. My nerves are on edge. - Can't you work faster? - Faster? Faster... - Maggie, I can't stand it. - Please Lady Bolton, please, please. You take your time. Oh, look. Madam, the pose. Do you expect me to pose when we all may be killed at any instant? I don't care if he is a genius. Either this bedlam ceases or I leave. Stop it. Stop it up there. All right. We heard you. - Well, at least we can eat. - I'm going to move out of this place. - Eat what? - Oh, what have we here? Would you carve? - I'm not hungry. - Oh Vernon. Why don't we get a call from the Aubels? Why don't they start? - Maybe we're not in the show. - You know we are. Oh Vernon, you're the optimist, you're the one that always sees the bright side. Bright side? Look. Darling, that's all that's left. Walter. Quiet, quiet. Look, they've started rehearsals for the show today. - Started rehearsals? - That's what it says. - Repetition commences. - Why didn't Mr. Aubel let us know? What's difference it makes? The show starts our salary starts, come on. Let's get over to theater. Hey Walter, where are my dancing shoes? - In the trunk. - Oh, no, they're on your feet. - Oh, come on, let's go. - Oh wait a minute. I can't go until I press my suit. You and Walter go, I'll meet you there. All right, hurry. Hello, Mr. Aubel. Ah, Monsieur Castle. Why didn't you tell us rehearsals started? Did you think we didn't need any? - But you knew what you have to do. - Come. There she is. - Oh, but you hired us to dance. - Dance? No, no, no, we have the dance. - Oh, you will be a knockout Mr. Castle. - All Paris will laugh. You are a very funny man. ♪ The whole French nation you will hear them saying... ♪ ♪ A real sensation and the people will stay till the break of the day. ♪ ♪ While we are dancing... ♪ Well? - What happened? - False alarm. Hello Zowie. I got myself all pressed up. You look nice too, don't she Vernon? Yeah. What happened? Well... Here's a present for you. Oh, my little Dutch cap. - We didn't have money to buy this. - We haven't now. Darling, they didn't hire us to dance. They just want me for the barbershop scene I did with Fields. I won't do it Irene, I told them I wouldn't. Then they brought up the money we owe them. Vernon, they let you dance alone, because if they would... Do you think I'd want to dance without you? I should've let you keep on doing what you were doing. All my fault. No, it isn't. Look darling, we're all right now. After all, you have got a job. May not be the job we wanted but still it's a job. Maybe later on we get a chance... sometime. Maybe sometime. Hey. Dance with me. All the people downstairs... Look, we can do it quietly, like this... Just as if we're walking on air. Funny and we're down to earth for the first time. - What do you suppose they're doing? - And you call me nervous. I'm not nervous, I'm simply curious. That's nice. Take a good look Walter, this is our farewell appearance. Get me a chair. I said get me a chair. What do you call that? That what you were doing. Oh. Well, I, I don't know, I guess you might call it the Castle Walk. - Castle Walk? - Castle, that's our name. I'm Vernon Castle and this is my wife. My name is Walter. I'm Maggie Sutton. Oh. Maggie Sutton, of course. How would you like to try out for a dancing job? - What? - Where? - At the Cafe de Paris. - Cafe de Paris? Irene. - You know the manager? - My dear, the manager knows me. - Darling, we got a job. - Ah, just a tryout. All I could guarantee would be your dinner. Well, maybe you could arrange that for tonight, the dinner, I mean. And we could dance tomorrow night. Well, I think it might be arranged that way. - Dinner at the Cafe de Paris. - Dinner anyplace. Dinner. - Do this person dance too? - No, but I eat. Walter is our sort of manager. He was your manager. You mean you're an agent. I'm an entrepreneuse, but I still expect my 10 percent. That's some old crank downstairs, don't pay no attention. I beg your pardon? - Everyone is staring at you. - Oh dear, I hope not. Because you look so beautiful, just like a bride. I should in my wedding dress, my Dutch cap. I hope it brings us luck. I am honored by your presence Your Highness. My dear Louis should thank Miss Sutton, she is my guide to Paris. And none better Your Highness. - They look very respectable for dancers. - Dancers? Who dances? You must come back tomorrow night, Louis has a treat for you, two Americans. But tomorrow I'm leaving for St. Petersburg. - Why do they not dance tonight? - Well, I doubt if they're prepared. How does one prepare for a dance? One simply dances. Have them dance. I think it's going to be quite amusing, American dancers? - A little more caviar, please. - Foie gras too. And plenty of the truffles. Such a rush all day, I didn't even have time for tea. I lunched at the club, food is very dull there. - Can you dance now? - Now, tonight? I have a Grand Duke over there, if he likes you, you're made. - But the orchestra? - We haven't rehearsed with them. Oh, they can play anything you want. - But our dinner. - No, no, no, dance first. But if he doesn't like us, do we still get dinner? If you feel like it. Well Vernon, we've nothing to lose. Tell them to play Too Much Mustard. - Oh Vernon, I've forgotten everything. - No, come on, dance with me. I raised them. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. And Mrs. Castle will dance again in one half-hour. You know, it's funny I'm not a bit hungry now. - Neither am I. - You can't waste it. Oh, magnifique. From now on you dance here every night, I pay you. A tip from the Grand Duke. A tip? But, but we can't possibly accept it, we're very grateful but... No, this is no time to be proud. We need it. Irene, look what they're doing.

Oh, of course I know you're tired. So I've arranged for you have a week's rest before you start up. What's this? We going out on the platform, she needs air. Another mouth to feed, that makes seven. Where and when did you buy that? In Baltimore. Here's the bill, hello Maggie. Maggie? Very touching. We'll be in New York in an hour, it'll help a great deal if you sign this now. Maggie, we want to buy a house in the country. - All right, buy it. - Yes, but we want to live in it. All right, live in it. She don't want air, she wants water, come on Mag. Now listen you two, you better make hay while the sun shines. Maggie, we're in love. We've made enough money. Now we want to live like simple married people. In a house with our clothing closets instead of in trunks. We're not going to sign any contracts. We've got it all planned, first of all we'll visit England. And Vernon is going to show me where he was born and where he went to school and... Well, everything he knew before he met me. I didn't know anything before I met you.

Well, if I were your age and had your opportunities... Don't try to talk us out of it, we're firm. - Don't interrupt me, as I was about to say. - It won't make a difference. I was about to say I'd want to do exactly what you're going to do. Where are we? Extra, extra. Here boy, boy... Germany declares war, England mobilizes. Thousands volunteer for British army. Oh, I guess it won't amount to anything, says here that Europe can't afford a war. It would probably be over in a week. - Will you be spending the night here? - I should say not. I find the country quiet very disturbing. How would you like to be back in Paris? I see by the papers they bombed it again. Here comes Sailor. - Hello Maggie. - Hello there. - Walter, you told Vernon who was here yet? - No, but I will. How are you Maggie, old girl. Well Irene, you ready come back to the outside world? As far as we're concerned there's nothing going on the outside world. There's a war going on. - Don't talk that way in front of Vernon. - Then it's on his mind? No, not at all. Women are pathetic when they try to fight something bigger than they are. I'm not trying to fight anything, Vernon is my life. I'm his life, isn't that enough? One girl against an army? Isn't quite enough Irene. Come on, let's find Vernon. - Vernon, Maggie is here. - Oh, hello Maggie. - Vernon? - What's the matter? Oh, Vernon. Oh, the uniform, it is for the British benefit Sunday night. They've asked me to dance, I told you about it. - Well, if this is your idea of a joke. - No. Oh, I'm sorry darling. I haven't enlisted, some crazy fellow in the Publicity department sent this down. I'm, I'm not going to wear it, just tried it on. - So you went and done it, eh? - No Walter. You told me if you ever enlisted, I could join up too. Oh, it isn't real Walter. It's just a uniform for benefit, it doesn't mean a thing, he's not even going to wear it. Of course not. Come on Walter, we'll send this back and I'll dig out something else to wear. Looks like a regular soldier, don't he?

Fine bunch of men. Ladies and gentlemen... We want to thank all of the performers who have so willingly given their services to... - Where's the recruiting officer? - We have a man here who wants to join up. He's over there talking with Mr. Castle. To thank this splendid representative body of Canadian men. - Frank, have you seen Mr. Castle? - He just went downstairs. Oh? Vernon. Darling, I've enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps. I had to Irene. Maybe if America were in the war you'd understand how I feel, why I have to go. I know. It won't last long. They say one more push and it'll all be over. That's not so bad, is it? And I'll come back, and we'll settle down. And have the house again and everything. Just as we were. Yes darling. They may kick me out sooner than that. I'd probably make a very bad soldier. You'll make a very good soldier. - Hey, you look your aileron sir. - Yeah, I know. - Fly till you could get back. - I had to get back. I had to get back, my furlough starts this afternoon. - Well, I'll say you earned it. - Telegram, Lieutenant Castle. - Sailor is in Paris. - What? Walter, we'll be seeing her tonight, you realize that? We'll be seeing her, come on. - Castle. - Yes sir? - You better see these plate holders. - What's the matter with them? - Busted the whole lot of them. - I'm afraid so. That bullet had your name on it, it's a lucky thing this case was in the way. - Well, we can get them tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - But I start my leave this afternoon sir. - I'm afraid it'll have to be postponed. GHQ wants this sector covered. - Can I go up right now? - Without a convoy? Yes sir, I can use Morgan's plane. - Well, go ahead, good luck. - Thanks. - Hey Flight, stand by that plane. - Yes sir. - Why won't you get going? - Where? Paris, tell Irene I'll meet her at Louis' at 8 o'clock. - Contact. - Contact. Tell her to save the first dance for me. Well, don't just sit there, talk. - There ain't much news where I come from. - Then make some up. Well, we lost a couple of planes this morning but... they lost more. Guess that ain't very interesting. Irene, did you tell Walter about your offer to go to California to make moving pictures? No, that so? - Maggie, why doesn't he come? - Now, now, he's all right. Back home, I used to think, Oh, if I could only be over there with him. And now I'm here and... he's not. Ladies and gentlemen... a few years ago, I introduced for the first time someone who is now most famous. She has come back to dance for us again tonight, Mrs. Vernon Castle. Ladies and gentlemen, I... I... Oh Vernon. A quarter to 5. It's almost daylight. Oh Vernon, how long do you think it'll go on? I don't know, nobody seems to know. Is it terribly dangerous in those planes? I mean, worse than in the trenches? Darling, we said we wouldn't talk about it tonight. I know, but it's almost morning, and you'll be going back and... I won't see you for a long time. I shouldn't worry, it's foolish. I'm not the only soldier's wife, I know that. You will be careful, won't you? I'll be careful. And what's more, I think I'm going to be lucky. - Lucky? - Yes. They say there's one bullet with your name on it. If it misses you, you come out all right. Well, I think my bullet missed me yesterday. - Darling. - And from now on, I'm going to be all right. - It's a good idea to hang on to. - I'll hang on to it. You think of everything, don't you? You thought of coming here instead of the Ritz or... some place that might not feel quite like home. What's that? Oh, Vernon, maybe the war is over. - What's happened? Qu'est-Ce Que c'est? - N'est-Ce pas monsieur? The Americans have come into the war. - America. - Hooray. - Darling, you know what that means. - Yeah, the war is practically over. Yeah. - Is out there. - This for the picture now, camara, action. We're ready Mrs. Castle. All right Mrs. Castle, all right Mr. D'Arcy. Now, let's make this bigger than the war. Ready, camera, action. That's it Mrs. Castle, closer. Mrs. Castle, closer... - Bigger eyes Mrs. Castle. - Irene, telephone. Can't you see we're shooting? Irene, Vernon is on the telephone, he's in Canada. Oh Vernon. Oh excuse me. Cut. Cut. Cut. - Hello? Hello. - Darling, I just landed in Canada. Yeah, but I'm being transferred next week to Fort Worth, Texas. Fort Worth, Texas? Well, that's practically here. I know. I'm to be a flying instructor for the American Army. Hello, Sailor, how are you? - Tell her who it is. - That was Walter. - Can you meet me there next weekend? - Next weekend? Oh, I can't wait. - Me too. - Yes darling. Now, I want a room where we can have dinner and absolute privacy, understand? You just leave it to me captain. This ain't so much. - Nice set up, eh? Cozy? - Yes, this will do. I know the ladies, they like things nice. - Say, who do you think is going to be? - Walter. - My friend here is a bit strait-laced. - Sure, I know the type, reformer. Well, he's in the army now, eh captain? Can you close off that garden? Oh, you'll be as snug as a bug in a rug up here captain. I want reserve the garden too. But that's for special out-door occasions, our orchestra plays there. - I want the orchestra. - Oh, atmosphere, eh? No, music, you dumb. Walter, try to be a little more sophisticated, like the gentleman here. Oh, here he is, in here. Captain, you are to report back to the field immediately. Not me, I've got weekend leave. I'm sorry captain, I know you just got here but a brigadier gen.. blew in for inspection. They want all pilots in the air this afternoon. Thank you lieutenant. Well, it looks as if I have to leave it all to you. Don't worry I know what you want. A hot bird, a cold bottle and a warm shoulder, eh captain? Look, here's the list of the music I want the orchestra to play. You take care of it and explain to the lady I may be a little late. - Sure will, what name will she give? - It's his wife. - Your wife? - Yes, do you mind? No, I don't mind, but I don't understand it. All right Castle. Only one more hour. Hey, young fellow, sit in the back. But the officer just told me that student pilots... - I know, I like to ride in front. - Yes sir. Why won't Captain Castle ever ride in the back seat? Nobody can make him ride in back... since that crash in Canada when the boy in front got killed. Gas on, switch off. - Contact. - Contact. Here we are. Nice, eh? Best suite in the house. You're right across the hall Miss Sutton. Did Captain Castle say how long he'd be at the field? No ma'am, but he arranged for dinner at 7:30 in the private dining room. - Sounds almost wicked. - We cater only to a family trade ma'am. - I beg your pardon. - No, my card. If we can ever be of any service to you, call on me. - A wife-beater if ever I saw one. - Maggie, won't you have dinner with us? - We'd love to have you. - Liar, you'd better get dressed. Here comes Castle's squadron now. Colonel, look out there. Don't let that fool take off, flag him down. Walter. Oh, it's wonderful to see you. - Hello Sailor. - Where's Vernon? Oh, so that's it. Vernon? We wait months to see each other, now you play games. Vernon. Where is he? What's happened? Sailor, Vernon's... He's hurt. Well, where is he? I've got to... No. He had his choice of hitting another plane or crashing his own. The student with him wasn't hurt much but Vernon was in the front seat. He was a hero Sailor. Oh Vernon. They'll remember what he did this afternoon, they'll remember a lot of things he did. The way he laughed and the way he danced. The way he made other people want to dance. - Walter, he was just beginning to live. - He'll go on living, for you and me. Maybe even for a lot of people that never knew him. There's got to be something in him in every boy and girl that get up and dance together. They were singing that the day I met him out in the water with Zowie. I guess I'd better get down and tell them to stop. No, he wanted them tonight. That was the train, the first time he kissed me. Don't Sailor. Don't you want to go your room now? Go tell Maggie.
