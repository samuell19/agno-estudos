[line ringing] Roy, hi, it's Jodi Shaw. You said to call you. Uh-huh. Oh, sure! I could head over to you right now, if that works. Great. Yeah, I found her. Mm-hmm. Jodi Shaw. The one you're looking for. Hi, I'm Jodi Shaw, here to see Roy. Hi, Jodi. Let me get him for you. - [beep] - Roy, Jodi's here. Wow, Roy, that space is incredible. And I can really do anything I want? Look, I don't like to micromanage. I hired you because you can do the job. Besides, uh, I looked at your website, and it speaks for itself. And look, I know this is a bigger project than what you're used to, but... It's strange. I've been looking to hire an assistant. This could be the right time to do it. So what do you think about it? Hmm... I think I'll take it. Thank you, Roy, for this opportunity. Of course. And you can show your appreciation by making my restaurant the place to be. Well, I can definitely do that. Okay. Don't move. W-What do you... What do you want? Let's start with your wallet, and we'll move on from there. Okay, okay, okay. [woman screams] Help! Screw this. - Oh, my God. Are you okay? - [coughs] Yeah, I think so. Um, I don't know. My... My heart feels like it's gonna burst out of my chest. Okay, here, just look at me, look at me. - Just focus, okay? - [coughs] Take some deep breaths. Nice and slow. In and out. - [exhales] - That's it. Slow 'em down. There you go. I took a photo, but I don't think you can make out who he is. Do you wanna call the cops? I-I didn't get a good look either. I don't think... He didn't take anything. The important thing is that nothing bad happened. Thanks to you. Anyway, literally, you saved my life. I don't even know your name. [chuckles] It's Wendy. Thanks, Wendy. I'm Jodi. Pleased to meet you, Jodi. You're pleased? Well, I guess I'll let you get going. I'm sure you're very busy. Take care of yourself, Jodi. Wait. I can't let you just walk away without doing something for you. Can I at least give you a reward? No, no, I wouldn't take that. Well, at least let me get you a cup of coffee sometime. You don't have to do that, Jodi. Please. On the "very least I can do for you" scale, it's a solid ten. I wanna get to know the girl who saved me. Sure, why not? Great. Take my number. - Okay. - So it's Jodi Shaw... ERIC: Jo, you've had one hell of a day. First, a big job offer, then some creep almost mugs you? Yeah. I can still feel the knife against my neck. I swear, for a minute, I really thought that was it. I wish I was there to help you, baby. Thank God that girl Wendy was. I'm gonna take her for coffee tomorrow, say thank you. Can we talk about something else? No problem. So what's with the picnic anyway? It's not our typical lunch. I need a special occasion to have a special meal with my girl? I brought us a bottle of champagne. Wait. Oh, my God. Wait, what is it? Oh, my God. Jodi Shaw, I love you. Do you love me? I do. That leads me to my next question... Yes, I'll marry you! [laughter] I love it. Thank you. Wow. Today really is one for the books, huh? Yeah. Wait, so does this mean, um... we can finally move in together? You know how my parents feel about that living-in-sin thing. I don't wanna upset 'em now. Hey, we will be married soon enough, and all this isn't gonna matter anymore. How soon? Soon. You know, sometimes I think that you just wanna hold on to a teeny little bit of your bachelorhood. Maybe just a sliver. But I'm all yours. Well, we're all smiles today. Glad to see it. Anything new going on? I made contact with her. You did? I did. Well, that's great, Wendy! That's one of the things we've been working towards. Now, um, I hope you're managing your expectations. This isn't a typical situation. Don't worry, Dr. Farber. It couldn't have gone any better. In fact, I'm feeling so good these days, I don't think I need to see you anymore. But I am so grateful for all your help. Wendy, you can't just stop your therapy on a whim. Now, sometimes we think we're all better when it couldn't be further from the truth. And sometimes we are. But thanks again, Dr. Farber. I mean it. I couldn't have done it without you. I may check in on you later. No way! All of this happened in a single day? Yeah. Um, a job offer quickly followed by a near stabbing, soon to be finished off with an engagement. Okay, and just who is this girl who saved you in a parking lot? Her name is Wendy Richards. I'm gonna take her for coffee tomorrow to thank her properly. Hey, it's all just so nuts. I can't believe you're getting married. I'm happy for you. So you guys didn't set a date yet? We're gonna play it by ear. Hmm. You mean he bought the ring to buy some time. Hey, I thought you liked Eric. I do. It's just, you are aware that you're leaving me out here all alone, right? Monica... What do you want me to say? My partner in crime is going legit. I'm gonna be that sad, friendless girl sitting by herself at the end of the bar. Come on, you have other friends. And we do other things besides go to bars. Yeah. Folded arms, really? I don't know. I'm being awful, aren't I? I am happy for you, I swear. Of course, this means we're gonna have to carve out some Jodi-Monica time while we still can. What? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just a little anxious about this job I took on. It's just a restaurant. Find some classy tables, splash some paint on the walls. You know, a few bar stools. I don't see the big deal. It's more complicated than that. Jodi, you're awesome at what you do. You're gonna destroy it. Yeah, that's kinda what I'm worried about. ERIC: Anyone home! Hey, what are you doing here? I had a meeting close by, so I thought I'd surprise my fiancée with little floral affection. - How very Bachelor of you. - I thought so. You're so sweet. So how's it going? Um, it's not, really. I'm trying to find anything that inspires me, and so far nothing. Do you think I'm in over my head? Maybe you're just a little hungry. Mm, yeah. Actually, I haven't eaten today. You want something? I could eat a little. Okay, well played. It's gonna have to be quick, though. I'm meeting Wendy for coffee in an hour. The good Samaritan. I almost forgot. Mm-hmm. [phone buzzing] Hey, I gotta take this. It's a work call. [whispering] I told you not to call me. I was gonna call you. She's in the other room right now. Yeah, yeah, we're still on for tonight. I miss you too, baby. Mmm. Thanks again for the coffee, Jodi. This place is great. Oh, please. I still have no idea how I'm gonna thank you enough for yesterday. It's cool. It was just one of those right-place, right-time things. Hey, isn't there some old proverb about saving someone's life? Yeah, there sure is. It says that if you save someone's life, you become responsible for it, like you have an obligation to look after that person forever. I love those old sayings. So, uh, are you from around here? No, I'm from Oregon, but I just got an apartment here a few weeks ago. My mom died recently. Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. Thanks. She was battling cancer for a long time. I took care of her while I was getting my bachelor's degree, but when she passed, I just had to get out of there. New location, new perspective. [phone chimes] Is everything all right? Oh, yeah, everything's fine. Was that your fiancé? No, no, that was the new client, actually. How did you know I had a fiancé? It's written all over your finger. Oh! Sorry. It's, uh, it's still very new. So, new client. What do you do? I have a small interior design business. Oh, that's so funny. My mother worked in interior design before she got sick. So what kind of projects do you work on? Mostly smaller spaces. I just got my first restaurant, though. Congratulations. That sounds like a lot of fun. Mm-hmm, it is. It's definitely a lot. So how about you? Well, I just moved here, so I'm still looking for a job, but I need to start looking harder. The next few months are gonna get pretty tight. My last real job was assisting my mom with interior design. Oh, yeah? Did you like it? It was a lot of administrative work, but yeah, I really did. Now I know how I'm gonna return the favor. Come work for me. What are you talking about? This restaurant is the biggest client I've ever had. I was looking to hire an assistant. You have experience, so... But you don't even know me. Uh, Wendy, you saved my life. What else do I need to know? I'll need a reference, of course, but if you're interested, it's all yours. I'll take it. Thank you! I can't wait to get started! Me too! Cheers. [gasps] Don't sneak up on me like that. That's what you hired me for, right? [laughs] So how was I? Scary enough for you? First, take off the hood and the sunglasses. We need to be careful. And, yes, it worked. That's right, like a damn charm, it did. That girl was shaking like a leaf, even though she was in no real danger, except maybe from you. There's an extra thousand in there. Oh, yeah? What for? Because there's one more thing I'm gonna have you do for me. Yeah? What's that? [phone ringing] Dr. Farber, why are you calling me? Didn't I tell you I would? And didn't I tell you I'm all better now? Yes, you're feeling better, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you are. Well, I just had coffee with her, and it was wonderful. I get it that you're finally getting some closure here, and I'm very happy for you, but we still have some work to do, even if it's just over the phone. [phone chimes] I care about you, Wendy. Look, you're a very nice woman, Dr. Farber, but like I keep telling you, I'm cured. ERIC: Looks like she got her groove back. Starting to. Really is a ton of work, though. Didn't you say you're gonna hire an assistant or something? I just did, actually. I hired Wendy. - What? Are you serious? - Yeah, of course I am. Why not? You were just sitting down for coffee with her yesterday. What's her name again? Wendy Richards. And you just offered her a job like that. Did you think about having her in your house every single day? I know, I hear you. She's basically a stranger. Jo, she's not basically a stranger. She is a stranger. Relax. I was just about to check on her reference. And if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. Look, I offered her the job, okay? It wasn't like she asked me for it. No good deed goes unpunished. Did you even check if she could do the job? Yeah, I'm pretty sure she can. Either way, I'm willing to roll the dice. Don't worry, baby. I have a good feeling about her. If you say so. Dinner's in the kitchen. [line ringing] Hi, my name is Jodi. I was given this number to check on a reference for someone I'm looking to employ. Uh-huh. Yes, her name is Wendy Richards. She worked at your interior design company. I believe her mother did too. Is there anything that you can tell me about her? Yeah, she was an excellent employee. Honestly, one of the best I ever had. That young woman could spot a problem from a mile away. Really sorry to see her go. Well, thank you. That is exactly what I wanted to hear. Okay, thanks. Yeah, bye. Take care. JODI: Well, this is it. Wow. I love your office, Jodi. I totally get why you do what you do. So this is the young lady who saved my girl. Uh-huh, this is her. I'm Eric. Wendy. Nice to meet you, Eric. My pleasure. All right, I gotta head back to the office before this whole town's legal system falls to pieces. - Okay, well, call me later. - Okay. - He's, uh, quite a charmer. - He sure is. And he doesn't mind having somebody new in his home? Oh, no, Eric doesn't live here. Oh. I just assumed he did. Well, I'd be into living together before we get married, but he wants to wait until we make the whole thing official. So you're never afraid, living here alone? Not really. It's a good neighborhood. And he really is here a lot of the time, as you can tell from all his random crap that he leaves lying around, and all his legal stuff, and his freaking golf clubs. So much clutter. What's that? Oh, nothing. So, um, shall we get started? Yeah. Hey, you do know we're gonna nail this project up and down, right? You sound extremely confident when you say that. And you should be too. Come on, say it with me. We're gonna nail this project up and down! Damn right, we are. - Come on. - Great. Let me show you where I'm starting with today. - [knocking] - MONICA: Hello. Jodi, are you here? WENDY: You know what might be a good idea? What if we went out and found a local artist or two - and displayed their work. - Who is that? JODI: That would show pride in our town, develop a real sense of community in the place. WENDY: And you can't buy that kind of thing can you? - JODI: That's an awesome idea. - Hi. Hey, Monica! I didn't hear you come in. And who's this? I'm Wendy. Oh, you're the lifesaver. Thanks for helping out my best friend. She's also my new assistant on the restaurant project. Really? Um, well, congratulations. So maybe she can hold down the fort while we go grab a quick lunch? She's welcome to join, of course. What do you think? That does sound like fun, but we're kind of on a roll here. Might be hard to get the energy back up after a big meal. Yeah, you know, she's right. I'm sorry, Monica. Another time okay? Um, yeah, that's fine. I guess I'll get out of your way then. I'll walk you out. It was great meeting you, Monica. Same. Isn't it a little fast to hire somebody you just met? Maybe, but, you know, she needed a job, and if it wasn't for her, I might not be here now at all. All right, fair enough. Well, we simply have to celebrate you not getting stabbed by a crazy mugger. Happy hour, Thursday? I really should be buckling down. But I guess a little night out won't hurt. Just a drink or two. It'll be a riot, I promise. - Call you in the morning? - Sure. - Do you think? - Yeah. - Okay. - [phone ringing] One sec. Eric, hey, what's up? Just finished a few briefs. About to grab a late lunch. Anyway, I wanted to check in, see how it's going with Supergirl. Oh, really? Super, actually. She's been a great help so far. Great. Glad to hear. Anyway, I'll let you two go back to work. All right. Thank you, baby. Have a good lunch. I will. I love you. I love you too. But I don't understand what you're saying. We had a deal. Yes! Oh, well, no, but that's not fair! Oh, right, like I can just afford to take you to court. That's all you have to say about it? You know what? Thanks for nothing. Wendy? I'm sorry. That was a personal call. It won't happen again. Hey, if I can take personal calls, so can you. Everything okay? Yeah. [clears throat] It's all good. That didn't sound any good, much less all good. What's going on? You know how some days life just decides to throw a brand-new lesson your way? Well, today I learned to never do a handshake deal on an apartment. Ouch. - [sighs] - Ohh... I'm sorry. It's fine, it's fine. I'll figure something out. Like what? When I think of it, you will be the very first to know. I guess a motel in the short term. A motel? I'll be all right. Okay, we can do better than that. I have a guest bedroom. Why don't you just stay here until you find a new place? I-I couldn't. You could, actually. Do it for me, all right? I cannot risk losing any great ideas because my assistant is too busy stressing out about where she's gonna sleep. Thank you, Jodi. First the job and now this? Oh, God. Look, I know I keep saying it, but it really is the least I can do. Okay, what about your stuff? Couch, bed? The apartment came furnished. I'm traveling light these days. They do want me out by Friday, though. Screw 'em. Go get your stuff and bring it back here now. Jodi, you're the best! [bell rings] Hey, Wendy, were you able to get quotes for the floor tiling? I sure did. I sent you an email on it about a half-hour ago. Thank you, Wendy. I mean it. I cannot believe how much you managed to get done on the first day. We make a pretty good team, huh? You want a glass of wine to celebrate? Oh, I'm good. Alcohol makes me tired the next day. It can have that effect. [phone chimes] So thanks again for letting me stay here for a while. I know Eric doesn't live here yet, but are you sure he's gonna be cool with it? Oh, my God, he's gonna be fine. ERIC: Jodi! Where are you? Oh, hey, babe! Were in here! [softly] Ah, she's still here. How's it going, ladies? Hey, baby, we were just talking about you. You two finishing up some work? No, no, we finished up. Oh. What are you still doing here? Well, Jodi said that I... Wendy's gonna crash here for a little while. Say what? Just until she finds a new place. Well, what happened to your apartment? My landlord kicked me out. [scoffs] Just like that. Yep, just like that. The jerk pulled the rug right up from underneath my feet. Well, you do know you have rights as a tenant. Yeah, I know, but I didn't officially sign a lease or anything. You didn't sign a lease. Why? Well, I was going to, but it was kind of a subletting thing. It's a little hard to explain. You have squatters' rights... Baby, we talk in the kitchen real fast, hmm? Be right back. - I know what you're gonna say. - And I'm alone here? You didn't even know this girl a few days ago. Now she went from your office assistant to living in your house with you? You mean a few days ago when she stopped me from possibly getting stabbed to death, and today I'm simply trying to pay it back? I'm not downplaying what she did for you, but you don't think it's a little strange she's entrenched in your life like this now? Look, I overheard her on the phone losing her apartment, so I offered her the guest bedroom. Again, she hasn't asked me for a single thing since we met. Her bags are now in your guest room. What do you want me to do? You want me to ask her to leave? It's not like something like she's in your way. It's not like you live here. How did this become about us? Well, it's true, isn't it? - Hey, um, I should go. - Wendy... Let me just grab my things, and I'll get out of your hair. Nice. Wendy! Wendy! Wendy. Wendy, stop. It's all right, Jodi. The last thing I want to do is be the cause of any trouble between you guys. The cause of my trouble? Are you serious? I need you. Hey, thanks for saving me there with Eric. Do you think he's gonna flip out over this? Don't worry about him, okay? He's just being protective. But this is my house, my company, and I make the rules here, so... you'll stay? Of course I will. Okay, great. [chuckles] [laughs] I can't believe I actually did it. I never imagined I'd actually be here... with her in her house. Look at me now. Come in. Hey, how's it going in here? Is the room okay? It's perfect, Jodi. Thank you. Is Eric still around? No, no, he just left. And don't worry. We're all on the same page here for the most part. Well, we're certainly getting there. Well, bedtime for me. I'm exhausted. Oh, right. I almost forgot to tell you. Um, I got an email from Roy, the restaurant client. He wants to meet us both in his office this week. Sounds good, Boss. Okay. Well, if you don't need anything else, I'm gonna say good night. I have everything I need. Okay. Finally. Tsk, tsk, tsk, Jodi. There's nothing healthy to eat in here. I have to do some shopping for you. JODI: And the next one. Nice. Very nice. Any notes? Uh, you know, I'm not crazy about the blinds for the main room. I'll keep looking. This is really good work, Jodi. I'm impressed. Well, thank God. I, uh... I've been a little worried you might be disappointed. Well, I wasn't worried. Can you believe with all of her skills, she has the nerve to doubt herself? I mean, this woman can do anything. Couldn't agree with you more. Okay, you two are gonna make me blush. I will say, though, that Wendy has been incredibly helpful so far. Here is some work from a couple of local artists that should turn a few heads in our little eatery. All Wendy's idea. Oh, wow. These are great. We really make a great team, huh? Well, based on how you two met, I'm gonna have to agree with you there as well. No doubt we'll still be telling you we're just a couple old ladies in the nursing home. So, Wendy, um, what are your plans beyond this project? Um, I'm not really sure. I'd love to continue working in interior design with Jodi, but I probably need a college degree to be taken seriously. Oh, wait, I thought you told me you had a bachelor's degree. Yes, I did say that, and I do, but I just mean one that's more closely connected to this type of work. Ah, yeah, makes sense. Mm-hmm. Uh, so is there anything else? Uh, no, I think we're good. So, uh... any plans for dinner tonight? Spending time with your man, I assume. Actually, I'm having drinks with my best friend Monica. Nice, nice. Well, I hope you have a great time, and I'll be in touch soon. Great. - Thank you, Roy. - Of course. Thank you, Roy. [phone ringing] Dr. Farber, I'm starting to feel like you're stalking me. That's hardly the case. Did you get my text about calling me? Yes, I got it, but I don't think you're getting it. Reconnecting with my past is the most important thing I have ever done. But if you're not mentally prepared for it, you could undo a lot of what we've been working on. Look, I appreciate your concern, but I'm actually very busy right now. Can I just give you a call back when things settle down a bit? Please do that. And before you go, I'm curious. What did the woman say when you told her everything? - Well... - Wendy... you did tell her everything, right? Look, Doctor, I gotta go. Next time. Everything okay? Why does everyone keep asking me that? I'm perfect. Glad to hear it. Just wanna let you know I'm gonna go get ready. - For what? - Drinks with Monica. I really need to get a move on. I'll see you inside. Yep. Jodi, the party has arrived. Are you here? Oh! You scared me. Sorry. I forgot the party was coming Yeah, that's me. Hey, Jodi are you almost ready? We're meeting Kate. JODI: Be right there! So, uh, aren't you two done working for the day? Yeah, we finished up a while ago. Then what are you still doing here? Just watching some TV. I might stream a movie later. I haven't decided yet. Why would you do that here? Don't you have a home? Oh, Jodi didn't tell you? This is my home now. Ready. This one's raring to go. What time will you be back? Uh, not too late. Okay, because we really have a lot of work to do tomorrow. Okay. We're gonna miss happy hour. Let's go. - She's living with you now? - I will tell you at the bar. ♪♪ [casual] So Monica told me about that girl who saved you from some stabby-looking dude. That is so crazy. It was pretty crazy. I'm not gonna lie. Did your life like flash before your eyes or anything? No, I don't think so. You know, it all happened so fast. Hey, how about another round? Well, for me, I have a 7 a.m. spin class. - Oh, bummer. - We'll do it again soon. Get home safe. Well, looks like it's just us. And I'm having a blast, Mon, but I think I'm done too. Oh, come on. Before you know it, you'll be watching Housewives repeats, sitting next to Eric, wishing you were here laughing with me. Please. Eric hates those Housewives shows. And maybe by then, a housewife I shall be. Well, then cheers to that. But it's time to call a car service. Okay, okay, I'll do it. Okay. Siri, call me a car service. SIRI: Okay. You're a car service. [laughing] Oh, come on! I'm the one that's gotta get up and go out of town tomorrow to see my folks. What's the matter, you gotta get home to Wendy? JODI: Are you jealous? MONICA: I am not. It's just the whole situation is weird. She's working for me. Why is that weird? And lives with you and checks out when you'll be coming home like some annoying little sister. JODI: You're making too much of this. And you don't know anything about her. I checked with her last boss, okay? He gave me his full stamp of approval. I appreciate your concern, but after what she did... I get it, I get it. She was there when you needed help. If I was there, not only would I have saved you from the dude, but I'd have beat him with my left shoe. Hmm. I believe you. Come on, let's go. All right. Fine. One more drink. Half a glass. That is it. - A nightcap, if you will. - Oh, I will... go to the bathroom, then I will meet you in the living room. Hurry back, 'cause I'm gonna pick out your best cabernet. Jesus! You scared me. What are you doing? It's time for you to leave. We're having a nightcap. Have one at your own house. It's late. But the car already left. Well, then call another one. What are you doing? Get your hands off me. Don't you ever try to do this to Jodi again. Do you understand me? Do what? Help her fail. I won't let you. Come on! What are you doing? Get your hands off of me! Stop! [door closes] - Hey, Wendy! - Hi. Where's Monica? She went home. She said something about wanting to call it an early night. It's late. [laughs] Come on. That doesn't sound like Monica at all. Full disclosure, she took off after I explained how much work we have to knock out tomorrow. I may have been a little insistent. - Wendy... - I'm sorry, Jodi. It's just I really want this project to go well for you. I know you do. You know, it's probably for the best. Eric just texted me. He's coming over in an hour. I shall say good night. [phone chimes] [door closes] Good morning. You showed up pretty late last night. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You see my phone? Mm-mm, sorry. There it is. So Jodi's still sleeping? She is. A little too much wine. Maybe a little too much me. Sounds like a bad combination for a productive morning. You got that right. So what do you have planned for today? Lock myself in my office until my inbox is empty. Well, I gotta get going. Take care of my girl, will you? That's exactly what I plan to do. - Good morning, sunshine. - Morning. I poured you some fresh coffee, if you'd like. Yes, need is more like it. I'm telling you, I don't bounce back from these midweek late nights the way I used to. Well, why don't you take the morning to rest, and we'll get into the restaurant stuff later. Guess I could do with a little catch-up time around the house. What are you gonna do? Oh, hit a few stores. I'd like to check out those mirrors we talked about. I think that you're right. They'll really make the entrance feel a lot bigger. Well, sounds like a plan. You're the best. Is Eric still here? He just left. He said something about an important meeting he had to get to. I should get going too, I suppose. Thanks for taking care of me, Wendy. It's what we do for each other. [weights clanking] Boo! You got me. Mm-hmm, I sure did. Come on, Laura. I need to get a quick workout in before I head back to the office. I can give you another workout. ERIC: Thanks for stopping by. It was fun. Whatever. You'll be calling me. [weights clanking] Boo. Laura, I just... Wendy? I'm confused, Eric. Didn't you say you had to clear out your inbox? What are you doing in my house? Not cheating on my fiancée, that's for sure. And you? Oh, my... I'm just getting a workout between my meetings. [chuckles] Yeah. I heard you sweating it out with your little girlfriend up there. You need to mind your own business. - I'm serious. - No. You're not serious, Eric. That's the problem. You know that look you shot me when we first met? That flirty little smirk? I bet you give that to every halfway decent girl that you meet, like it's instinct. You're no good for her life. She needs to know that. And who the hell do you think you are? You have known Jodi for a week. You don't know anything. [laughs] Well, I know this. Jodi's madly in love with me. And when I finally tell her that you've been hitting on me since the day we met, you're gonna be a distant memory in both of our lives. Your bond is nothing. Wendy, you are nothing. The truth is... I can do whatever I want with Jodi, and there's nothing that you can do about it. [thud] [Eric groans] Hey, you were gone awhile. Was I? Yeah, um, I guess. So I take it you're feeling better? [chuckles] I am. Thanks. Are you okay? You look a little pale. Yeah, I'm fine. Actually, I'm better than fine. I'm great. Did you get everything done you wanted to? Mm-hmm. [doorbell rings] - Who's that? - I have no idea. Hi. Can I help you? I'm looking for Jodi Shaw. That's me. I'm Detective Jessica Kessler. What's happened? Uh, ma'am, would it be okay if I stepped inside, talk to you for a few minutes? - Um, yeah, sure, come in. - Thank you. Do you know an Eric Thompson? He's my fiancé. Is he okay? No, ma'am, he's not. Um, there was an accident earlier today. What happened? Someone struck him in the head while he was working out at his home. What? Are you serious? Afraid I am. He's in a coma. So he's still alive? I mean, is he gonna be okay? That's all I know right now. Um... Uh... I... I don't understand. Who would've done this to him? Yeah, that's a good question. Please, Detective, just tell me. Well, we do have a person of interest. Who? A young woman named Laura Banks. We checked his phone, and that's how I got to you. But there was also a very recent text exchange about a rendezvous at his place. What are you saying? Eric was screwing around on me? According to her, yes, they were. She swears she left him alive in his home after they were... done. I'm really very sorry. So I take it you didn't know the other woman. Anyway, I wanted to come by and let you know what happened myself. I've gotta get going, but, um... if there are any other questions, give me a call. Thank you. Thank you, Detective. I'll take care of her now. Of course. Come here. [Jodi sobs] Come here, come here, come here. It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. It's gonna be okay. I just called the hospital. And what did they say? How long will Eric be in the coma? Nurse said with his kind of head injury, it's hard to predict. I feel so bad for you, Jodi. I don't even know how I'm supposed to feel right now. I mean, of course I want him to be okay, but even if he is, I never want to see him again. What am I supposed to do with that? Have you ever done a bad thing for a good reason? What do you mean? I mean, perhaps that's what happened here. I'm not following you. Maybe Eric knew in his heart that he was incapable of giving you what you needed, what you deserved, and so he cheats, knowing full well that you're not a fool, knowing that in time, you're more than likely gonna catch him. Sometimes doing the wrong thing is actually the right thing to do. What? Why are you looking at me like that? You're just a really good person, Wendy. - I am? - Mm-hmm. I know we haven't known each other that long, but... you've been a really good friend to me. I'd usually be leaning on Monica right about now, but she's out of town for a couple of days. I'm here for you... for anything that you need. I know. - [phone rings] - Oh. Hey, sorry. I've been waiting for this vendor to call. - Take it, take it. - Thanks. I need to get myself together anyway. Roy called. He wants to meet at his office later. Mm-hmm. - Derek? - How's it going, sugar? - Why are you calling me? - We need to talk. There's nothing to talk about. What we did, it's over now. Yeah, yeah, it is, but you know, I've been thinking about all those fancy Hollywood actors and what they've earned for doing what I did, you know, pretending and making it look real? Just tell me what you want. Two words: additional compensation. I'm gonna need another three grand, or whatever you got going on there with that pretty lady gets scorched to the Earth with one anonymous little phone call. Well, doesn't seem like I have much of a choice then, does it? Ah, hell! We all have choices. I'm making one right now. What's yours gonna be, hmm? You win. Let's get together, and we can work it out. Thought you'd see it my way. When? What are you doing later? Meeting up with you, I guess. Same place? You got it. ROY: Jeez, Jodi. Listen, what happened with Eric, it's a tragedy any way you look at it. Yeah, well, since it happened while he was cheating on me, the only way I look at it is over. I feel so bad for you. Wendy said the same thing. She's been so great about everything. So she's working out? You don't like her? No. I mean, she seems perfectly nice. It's just... Just say it. Well, I was there when you caught her in that lie about getting a college degree someday. Really? You're worried about that? How many people lie on their résumé a little to get a job? Yeah, I guess you're right. Hey, so here's a crazy idea, and feel free to say no if it's too much, but... how do you feel about having dinner with me Friday night? You mean like as a work thing? [laughs] No, no. Like a... Like an adult thing. And we can talk about work as much as you want. Clearly, this has been a rough week. Just let me buy you a meal. Um... Sure, why not? It's just dinner. Okay. So, um, I'll call you to make a plan, and for now just go home and take care of yourself, okay? Yeah, sounds good. Thanks, Roy. Of course. Dave. Hey, it's Roy. How are you doing? Yeah, great. Listen, I have a question. Do you still have your toes dipped in that private investigator thing? Good. No, no, I'm gonna need a favor. - [phone ringing] - Where the hell is this girl? [ringing continues] Where are you? I've been waiting here 20 minutes. WENDY: Relax. I'm just about there. I got what you're asking for. Good. And hey, I hope there's no hard feelings. I mean, this is just business, nothing personal. Nah, you were right. You definitely deserved more than what you got. Where are you? I still don't see you. Hello? Hello? Remember before when you said we all have a choice? You chose wrong! [stab] Jodi? Jodi, are you here? Don't you ever leave? - Don't you ever knock first? - Just got back into town. I heard about what happened to Eric. Yeah. What happened to her cheating fiancé was terrible. Where is Jodi? Oh, you just missed her. She left for dinner with a client. Fine. Well, she can meet up with me after, then. Hmm. Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea. You don't? And why not? Because your life is... messy. [scoffs] You know, I'm starting to get real sick of you. Same. And like I told you before, Jodi has no use for your kind of help anymore. She has me now. And who are you, Wendy? We really don't know, do we? I know it's hard for you to wrap your head around this, but she doesn't need you anymore. Oh, and she needs you? You're just a kid. Do you really think you're gonna keep me from my best friend? - How many times must I... - Just listen to me, Wendy! At some point soon, Jodi's gonna make a choice, so give up on this big sister-little sister vibe you're trying to build with her because she will choose me, I promise you that. Right now she's just paying you back for saving her or whatever. But when she's finished with that, you'll head back to whatever hole you crawled out of, and the rest of us will get back to our regular lives, messy as they might be. I'll let her know you stopped by. Don't bother. I'll just text her. Yeah, you do that. I'm sure she'll get right back to you. [door slams] I'm really glad you came out with me tonight. I know how tough this week has been. Jodi. - Yeah. Hi. - Hi. Sorry. Everything okay over there? Was this too soon? No, no, no. No, I'm fine, I think. I need a friend right now, so thank you for taking me out. Yeah. Anytime. Oh, I almost forgot. Wendy was gonna text me about a quote for a ceiling fan. Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. As your employer, I salute your after-work hours dedication to the job, but as the guy paying for this meal... - What's wrong? - I can't believe it. I've left my phone at home. [phone chimes] I know. I'm worried about her too, Kate. I just sent her a text to see if she wants to come over. - [phone chimes] - Hold on. Maybe that's her. Great. She's on her way. Talk to you later. Okay, bye. [chimes] [scoffs] You sure will. So while we're on the subject of Wendy, um... a friend of mine does some private investigation, and I asked him to dig into her a little. Really? Why? I'm just looking out for you... and for my business, as you brought her on board. Look, the only thing I know is that she may or may not be lying about her education, And? And my friend couldn't find anything bad about her. I'm not surprised. Or anything good. He couldn't find anything. She has no online profiles, no pictures, no social media accounts, nothing. Are you seriously telling me that you don't find this a little bit strange? Actually, I find it refreshing, someone her age who isn't obsessed with taking endless selfies or posting pictures of last night's dinner. Yeah, because she's obsessed with you. What are you talking about? I saw the way she looks at you. And that equals obsession. I should introduce you to my friend Monica. You and her can sit around and talk about what a lying, lowdown manipulator Wendy Richards is. [phone chimes] I know you see Wendy as your hero. Well, the truth is, you don't know anything about her. I appreciate your concern, Roy, I do, but I've spent enough time around Wendy now to know that she's a total sweetheart. Don't worry. If you say so. Jodi, are you here? I thought I heard you come in. [thud] [phone ringing] Hey, Kate. What's up? First thing, I'm so sorry about the whole situation with Eric. Thanks. What's the second thing? Have you heard from Monica? We were supposed to get together today, and I can't find her. No. I have no idea where she is. Oh. I thought maybe you would. Why would I? Because I was on the phone with her when you two were texting about you going to her place last night. That wasn't me. I didn't even know she was back in town yet. I left my phone at home. Um, look just let me know when you hear from her, okay? I will. Hey, Jodi? Hey, what's up? I was just gonna make myself some lunch. Do you want anything? No, I'm good, thank you. Are you okay? You look a little... off. No, no, I'm... I'm just trying to figure something out. Well, good luck. I'm sure that you will. So you got my email, right? You know what you're doing? Yep, got it. Sorry. I know I've kind of overloaded you with tasks today, but if we don't knock these out, we're gonna fall behind schedule. Anything I can do to help you, Jodi. That's why I'm here. Call me with any problems. Now why would I have any problems? That's... That's me. Wait, so Wendy went to Camp Beaverbrook? Oh, my God, we've met before. - [door opens] - [click] Hello? Elana. I remember you. Let's see if you can explain this. Hi, is Elana Connelly there? She's not. Yeah, could I get her number please? Sure. My name is Jodi Shaw. I used to work with her at Camp Beaverbrook, and I would love to catch up. Uh-huh. [whinnies] Very, very good. Wow. Beautiful horse. [phone ringing] Hello. - Hi, is this Elana? - Yes, it is. Hi, Elana. Uh, this is Jodi Shaw. You probably don't remember me, but I used to work for you about 15 years ago at Camp Beaverbrook. One of my lifeguards, right? Yeah, so you do remember me. Well, to be honest with you... Please don't be insulted... Um, I probably wouldn't have. So many great people have come and gone through the years in this place. But... Oh, sorry, but there was another Beaverbrook alumni who called me just a couple of weeks ago, asking for your name. Let me guess. Wendy Richards? Well, you've got the first name right, but her last name isn't Richards. It's, uh, Edelman. I went back through my records to verify that. Can I ask what else your records say about her? Well, I took some pretty good notes. I always do when there's a camper-related incident. It seems that Wendy was a very shy girl who panicked in the deep end of the pool and almost drowned. Fortunately, the lifeguard on duty did her job and saved her life, and that would have been you. So when she called me for your name so she could thank you, I gave it to her. I don't understand why she would give you a different last name though. I should've asked before I gave her yours. You don't remember her? No, I... God, I don't remember saving Wendy at all. I must have pulled ten kids out of that pool every summer. Like you said, that was the job. According to my notes, her mom pulled her from camp the next day and that was it. Well, not exactly. Oh, she found you, huh? Yeah, but she didn't tell me that we knew each other. She actually introduced herself to me by saving my life. What? So I gave her a job to say thank you and a room in my house to live. Now I don't know what to think. Oh, Jodi, I am so very sorry. I don't know what to say. Oh, you couldn't have known. Well, are you going to the police? With what? I mean... I don't have any proof that she's done anything other than give me a different last name. You know, I'm gonna have to go now, Elana. Thank you so much. You've reached the office of... Damn it. Voicemail. Okay, that's not too far away. I don't understand. No. No, this doesn't make any sense. How does she not know? How does she not know? How does she not know? How does she not know?! It's because she doesn't care. Jodi, we need to talk. [knocking] Oh, hello. Can I help you? I hope so. Are you Dr. Farber? I am. I wanted to talk to you about someone I know, someone I think is a patient of yours. I'm sorry. I'm not permitted to speak about my patients. I've driven a really long way to talk to you face-to-face. And I can see you're really serious, but again, there's nothing I could do. Well, can I just ask you one question? Is Wendy Edelman dangerous? Like I said, I've got some questions. Well, have a seat. Thank you. How do you know Wendy was my patient? I saw that you texted her this week, and I found your contact info on her laptop. Oh. So you're her, the young woman who saved her life. She didn't know your name. It's Jodi Shaw. How did Wendy approach you? By saving me from a mugger. An act I rewarded with friendship, job, a place to live. And since then, my fiancé is in a coma, and my best friend is MIA. Oh, my goodness. That's why I really needed to talk to you. Please, Dr. Farber, anything that you can tell me about her. I can say this. You've never really left Wendy's thoughts since that day. Those things happen in public pools and beaches all the time. But it's the last act of kindness she ever had. Her folks died in a car accident after that summer, and she went to live with her grandma. Poor thing, she spent all her time in a cold house with a cold woman who didn't want her and made sure she knew it. I had no idea. She felt worthless. She never made any friends. Wound up in a deep depression. Came to me a year ago when her grandma died. We talked about a lot of things, but it always came back to that beautiful girl who found her worth rescuing. I don't understand. Why wouldn't she come and see me before now? She thought you would reject her the moment you saw her again, like everyone else in her life. Now, we worked on it. I helped her build her confidence. I knew she had thoughts about finding you and reuniting with her childhood hero, but I didn't know she was gonna go out and do it. And now with this mugger thing... Wendy has a savior complex, and I just missed it completely. What's that? Someone who has a need to save other people. Hers is exclusive with you, so you... you... Could feel the exact same bond for her as she feels for you. God, to think that she's been clinging on to this memory all these years of me making her feel safe and secure. Back to my original question. Dr. Farber, is she dangerous? Wendy has issues, but no, I never saw anything that would make me think that. Me either. So did she set up the mugging? No. No, I don't... I don't think so. I'm sure Eric's injury was his own fault, and my friend will turn up soon. So what are you gonna do now? I'll talk to her, tell her what I know, try and get her the help that she needs. That's very kind of you, but be careful. She's a damaged girl. [phone ringing] Hey, Jodi. Wendy, hi, how are you? Oh, I'm all right. I'm kind of having a strange day, but I'm getting a handle on it now. Yeah, same here. I'm just about to head home. Will you be there? Of course. Is anything wrong? No, no, I just wanna have a talk. Good. Me too. I'll be there soon. Take your time, Jodi. Don't speed. That's how accidents happen. [line ringing] Hi, this is Jodi Shaw. Do you remember me? - [doorbell rings] - [door opens] WENDY: Roy, what are you doing here? Just wanted to have a little chat. Oh, well, Jodi's not here right now, so... That's okay. I actually came by to talk to you. Oh, okay. I'm actually in the mood for a talk. What is it that you wanted to chat about? Just have a few questions. About the project? About your past. And what is it that you know about it? Not a thing. Not even after some looking into. So I just don't think this is a healthy situation. You mean for the restaurant? I mean around Jodi. [phone chimes] Damn it. Got a problem with one of my east coast restaurants. We're gonna have to pick this up another time. [door opens, closes] [sighs] [panting] Oh, you're gonna remember me this time, Jodi. I promise you will. [door closes] Oh, hey, Wendy. I thought I heard you pulling up. Come on, let's have that talk. Um, before we get started, I... I just want to tell you that I know. That you know what? About how you and I have met before. I found the photograph on your laptop, of the two of us together at Camp Beaverbrook all those years ago. You got me. Honestly, I'm relieved. It's been really hard not telling you from the start. Thank you for being honest with me. You wanna talk, let's talk. But yell for help, and I'll end the conversation fast. My God. Wendy, what did you do? Oh, Jodi, I've been doing exactly what we talked about since we connected. After saving you, it became my responsibility to make your life as perfect as I could. I had no idea just how... cluttered your life would actually be. What are you saying? Don't you get it, Jodi? I did all of this for you, to repay you for what you did for me that day. When my witch of a grandmother finally croaked, I just didn't need a fresh start. I needed a whole new... life, and I wanted my very first actual friend... to be you. So yes, Jodi, I did set up that mugging so you'd feel exactly how I felt this whole time. But none of that matters now. There's only one way for this to end, and neither of us are being saved tonight. Wait, Wendy, I... Listen to me. I spoke with Dr. Farber. She told me about how you grew up... unloved, uncared for. No one could blame you for holding on to that summer. If that was the last time you experienced... kindness, felt safe... then I'm so, so sorry, Wendy. Please know I really do care about you. I don't know what you think could possibly happen here after everything we've been through together. This is the only way that it ends. - Drop the knife! - Wait! - I said drop it! - She needs help. - Yeah, no kidding. Move aside! - Wait! Wendy, I... Please, I saved you once. Let me save you again. Just... put the knife down. DETECTIVE KESSLER: Put it down. JODI: Drop it. [knife clatters] - Don't move. - It's all gonna be okay now. Put your hands behind your back. [handcuffs click] I guess I owe you one again, huh? DETECTIVE KESSLER: Let's go. Gotta say... job well done, Jodi. Appreciate it. And I agree. Well, now that this project is finally over, I guess we can start working on a new one. Sounds good. Not to ruin the mood, but have you heard anything about Wendy? Yeah, I spoke to Dr. Farber last week. She said that she's finally getting the help she needs from the doctors at the institution. I just thank God you called that detective and had her drop by just in case. Thank you. For what? Where do I begin? If it wasn't for you, the first real warning I had about Wendy, who knows? I may not have even looked into her in the first place. Yeah, I guess that's right. In a way, you kinda saved my life. How am I gonna repay you? Uh, why don't we just leave it at "thanks." That's a good idea. [laughs] Well, good morning. And how are we feeling today? I feel better. I'm just a little... out of it. Yeah, that's the drugs we're giving you. Don't worry, Wendy. We'll find the right combination of medication and therapy to get you straight again. Thank you, Dr. Thomas, for everything that you've done for me. - You're welcome. - I mean it. You saved my life. I'm just doing my job. I know. I'm just telling you how much it means to me. Okay, then. [door closes] [deep breath] I owe you one.
