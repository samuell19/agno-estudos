Hi, I'm Chika. My life is perfect. My parents love me very much and my sister is always so caring. They are always there for me. When I was sad after my beloved pet bunny died, they were there for me. When I was sick, they took care of me. I also have a boyfriend. He is my first love, in time when I have just started my teenage life. Mom, did you see my bag? It's on the chair. Are you leaving? Yes. I'm sorry I can't go with you to the airport. Are you going on a date? Yes, we've been planning it. We'll celebrate our second month together. You're going to Surabaya to take care of work, right? Yes. Look at how your boyfriend is more important than your parents. Of course not. You both are the most important to me. That's Dennis. I've got to go. -I promise I'll be back before 10:00 p.m. -Chika. Yes, Mom? Come here. Be nice to your sister. You have to listen to Karin. -Okay. -Chika? -Yes? -Come here. You have to learn how to be independent. Okay? Remember that. Why are you both all smiley today? I don't know why we can't stop smiling. Just take care of yourself. Bye, Dad. Looking good. Bye, Karin! Are you ready? I didn't know you like banana split. Today is special. Whatever you like, I also like it. What is it? Nothing. Is that Windy? What's with that face? No, it's nothing. Let me give you a spoonful. It was all warm and happy. But it didn't last long. Karin, I'm home. Can you call Mom and Dad and tell them that I'm home? I don't want them to worry. Karin? The Citra Air flight from Jakarta to Surabaya went down minutes before it landed. There is no sign of survivors. The cause of the crash remains unclear. -This is the third major accident… -No. -in the last two months. -Impossible! They should have landed. -They must be alive. -Chika. Call Mom and Dad! Call them! Mom, Dad, don't leave me. Please don't leave me. Mom, Dad… Karin. -They should be there. -I can't call them. Chika? Chika? Chika, I have to fly to Surabaya to retrieve the bodies. I can't believe this is happening to me. I lost my parents too soon in a very cruel way. Living without your parents is something that nobody can imagine happening to them, including me. -Hey, babe. -Hi. Thanks for waiting for me to finish our practice. You said you wanted to talk? I know you just lost your parents. But if I can't be honest with you now, I'm scared that you might find out from someone else and that it would hurt you even more. What are you talking about? I don't think this is working out. Let's break up. I don't know what my future will look like. I don't know how to be normal like other teenagers who are full of happiness, smiles, and ambitions. Mrs. Lina is picking up this dress tonight at 7:00 p.m. My sister is so busy with work. Becoming a famous fashion designer and owning a boutique has been her dream ever since she was little. She has now succeeded and is doing well. I'm happy for her. -I need to talk to you. -Just a minute. Let me text Mrs. Lina back. -She's coming over to pick up a dress. -Karin, I want to talk. Okay, go for it. Can we talk later? I'll see you at home. Please handle those carefully. It's just that she's so busy that she rarely spends time with me. It's so messy. What if someone comes into the boutique? All I want in life is to get my life back. I want my parents back. I want a family who is there for me. I want a boyfriend who will always love and support me whenever I need it. And one more thing. I want to write comics. It's been my dream ever since my parents bought me a comic book when I was little. In that comic book, it says that it's a challenge to get something we really want in life. But the opportunity is always in front of us. We just need to move forward, stay focused, and not dwell on the past. But how do I achieve all that? 1 YEAR LATER -You're selling the house? -Yes. But we spent our whole lives there. It's the house that Mom built for us. It holds a lot of memories. Chika, honey, I know it has a lot of memories. But you need to consider our lives now. The people who I work with, my boutique, and everything else is just so far from where we live now, don't you think? And if you think about it, you will only be sad if we stay at our house because you'll keep thinking about Mom and Dad. It's fine if you only remember the happy things. But every time you remember them, you always end up crying. Would you want to be sad all your life? I've already met the prospective buyers. They made a great offer. We're moving! -Where? -To Amazon. We're going to live with snakes and monitor lizards. To the house that I've been browsing, of course. Just trust me. The house is great. You'll love it. You have your own room. And what about school? We can just put your school in a lunch box, and bring it wherever we go. Karin. Gosh, stop sulking, will you? You've always complained that your school sucks. You don't like your teachers, you don't like your friends. Now, you have a new house and a new school. Isn't that cool? You'll have a new room and new friends. Who knows? I might get a new boyfriend. All right? Cool? Okay. We're here. Hey, wait up. Stop sulking, okay? You'll love the new house. Everything is new. Now, before you sulk more, go inside and pack your stuff. When you're done with that, before you sulk again, go pack my stuff. Smile for me, please. COMIC REJECTION NOTICE Hello? Chika! My designs are gone! They're all gone! Which designs? The costume designs for my friend, Yoza's film that I told you about. They're gone! I've turned my office upside down, and I still can't find them. All the designs are in that pink folder, and it is not here, Chika. There's a huge pink folder in my room. What? I took it from your room last night. I borrowed it because the designs are amazing. I used it as a reference for my comics. Chika! I am losing my mind! Come over here right now and bring the pink folder with you. Yoza is on his way here, Chika. He's taking those designs and has to go to the studio. If he doesn't have those designs, my collaboration with him will be cancelled! Do you understand? Now, go! I'm doomed. Taxi! Taxi! To Kemang, please. What's wrong? -Who are you? -Who are you? I'm a passenger. I was a passenger first. I was already in this taxi. I'm on my way to the airport. I'm already late, so get out. Wait, sir, I need to go to my sister's boutique in Kemang. This is an emergency. You can drop me off at Kemang, then take him to the airport. I will miss my flight if I don't go there now! Sir, I have a flight to New York this afternoon. Just leave this girl. Now get out! Sir, please take me to Kemang first. What the hell? Airport! -Kemang! -Airport! Stop! Both of you, get out! Settle this outside, then get in the car! Out! Sorry, but will you please let me have the taxi? It's so hard finding one here. Look, there are no taxis around. My sister's future is on the line. Well, my future is on the line as well. But my sister is going to be mad at me. Who cares? I don't even know you. Move! -Sir, to Kemang. I'll double the payment. -Hey, wait! Please drive. I think I ran over something. No! You ran over his foot! Back up! What? All right! Keep going! Wait, slow down! Sir! You've hit him! What? I hit him? Wake up! How did this happen? Sir, I think we have to take him to the hospital. Sir, stop! Chika. Sorry. -Where am I? -The hospital. You passed out right in front of my car. I took you here. How do you feel? I feel a little dizzy. The doctor will be here shortly. Is this yours? What's wrong? Well, there was a guy there who got hit by a taxi. He's all right. One of his shoulders was wounded because it got hit. Is it bad? Yes, but the doctor said he'll be fine in two weeks. The bruise on his leg will get better by then. This is his bag and his Handycam. Can you give it to him? Yoza told me to go once you're awake. Yoza? Yes. That's the name of the guy who got hit. I actually know him. He said he wanted to talk to you. Yoza, as in the guy who makes films? Yes. He was on his way to New York. What's wrong? Nothing. Is this yours? It fell. Yes, this is mine. Thanks… Danar. Right. Thank you, Danar. You're welcome. Hello? Chika, where are you? It's been two hours. Are you on a flight from Hong Kong? I'm still on my way. There's a traffic jam. I think there's an accident. An accident? Are you all right? I just called to let you know that it looks like Yoza is not coming to my boutique. He's not here yet. I called him, but he's not picking up. Really? Maybe… Maybe he had to take care of something? Probably. He's usually on time. If he isn't here, that means something happened. I'll just reschedule. Chika, you should just go home. I have to work late tonight. Ayunda Putri ordered a dress for her birthday party. -You mean the actress, Ayunda Putri? -Yes. Take care, all right? I'll be home by tomorrow. Okay? Take care at home too. Bye. Hey, are you all right? Cut the small talk. I'm in pieces because of you. I missed my flight to New York because of you. My Handycam is broken because of you. I put it in your bag so it won't get even more broken. It's already ruined. What difference does it make? Don't you know that this is very valuable to me? It fell because you pushed me. -I'm sorry. -That's enough. I don't mind the injuries I have because of you. This Handycam is the problem. I paid ten million rupiah for this camera. You should pay me back. I don't have that kind of money. Who cares? Pay me back! But how? Tell you what. Why don't we settle this later, okay? No way! I can't pay you back now. I don't have money. Look, I only have 50,000 rupiah. I used up all the money I had for your medication. -Please understand. -All right. Give me your name, address, and phone number. Here. Your name is Chika? -Yes. -Remember. You need to settle this. I'll give you a week to pay me back. I'll visit you next week. My uncle is a lawyer. My aunt is a policewoman. Don't you dare run away from this. Next week is way too soon. I can pay you back next year. -Next year? -Next month. -Too long! -Three weeks. -Next week. -Two more weeks. I'll pay you back in two more weeks. But you have to keep this a secret. No one can know about this, especially my sister. You can't let her know about what happened today. By the way, these are my sister's designs. I know you need this, so just take them. Your sister? Yes, Karin Aditya. She's my sister. The sketches for the costumes in your film are in that folder. I've got to go. Taxi! Wait. What's wrong? Let me stay a night at your place. -What? -A sleepover. -Sleepover? -Yes, a sleepover. My house is locked, and no one is home. Aren't you going to New York? I missed my flight, didn't I? Do you think that didn't cost me money? Do I need to ask you to pay me back for that too? -Let me stay for one night. -No! -Just one night! -No! Your sister said it's okay. If you're not okay with it, fine. But your sister will be really mad at you though. Because of you, I'm injured, my gadget is broken, and I missed my flight. Now, you won't let me stay for a night. I called your sister to get her permission. Do I need to call her again? All right, let's go. This is your house? Yes. Karin is working late. I know. She's always busy. If you're hungry, the kitchen is right there. If you need to go to the bathroom, it's over there. -I'm going to my room. -Okay. What are you doing? What are you looking at? Who says I'm looking? Do you sleep holding your boyfriend's picture? This is not my boyfriend. Who is it then? Your parents? How spoiled. This was their last picture taken before they died. Did you just wake up? About my friend, Yoza. He didn't come because he was in an accident. An accident? He told you everything? Yes, he even missed his flight to New York. But it wasn't that bad. He can still walk. Are you mad at me? Because of me, Yoza… Because of you? He got hit by a bajaj. Were you riding that motorcycle? What? A bajaj? Wasn't he hit by a taxi? What taxi? He said it's a bajaj. He just came to my boutique and left. He's right in front of me now. How did he meet you? Nonsense. He stopped by my boutique and left about five minutes ago. He said he's going to drive by our house to get my designs, so please hand them over to him. Chik, why do you sound so confused? Can you describe what Yoza looks like? He's tall, he has dark skin, curly hair, and he's around 30 years old. Why? What's his full name? Yoza Darmawan. What's wrong, Chik? Wake up. Hey, wake up. Hey. Is this how you treat your sister's friend? -Who are you? -I'm your sister's friend! -Liar! Who are you? -I'm Yoza! Liar! You're not Yoza Darmawan! I'm Yoza Prayuda. I'm your sister's friend! Stop lying! What friend? You lied to me. Stay where you are. I'm calling the police! 2 WEEKS LATER Excuse me. Can I help you? Do you happen to know if the people living here are home? I've been pressing the bell, but no one's answering. Chika and her sister moved out. They just left. What's wrong with you? Nothing, I'm just happy we're moving. I don't have to pay him back. I'm free. NO ENTRY What is that? Why does it say no entrance? I don't know. It's probably haunted. Nonsense. Who knows? A lot of places are haunted. There are a lot of ghosts, you know. Look who's beside you. Please, Chika, I'm beside you. No ghost looks pretty like this. Chika, this is our new home. -All right. -Isn't it nice? -Isn't it? -It's amazing. Let's grab our stuff. -Isn't it amazing? -It is. Let's go. We still have a lot of things in the car. -Hurry up. -Where do I put this? What's inside? I don't know, it's sealed. These are your comic books. Put it in your room. Your room is that way, out there. -Over there, okay? -Okay. Hurry. Do you like your room? I really love it. I thought it would be empty and messy. Did you do all of this? Of course. Cool, right? But you have to clean your room. I don't even know if I stacked those books correctly. You have to make your bed and fix your wardrobe too. Clean it regularly. I put our old photos with Mom and Dad on the shelves. Thank you, Karin. As long as you're happy. We still have a bunch of stuff in the car. Let's quickly put them away. Can we do it later? I'm tired. Don't take too long. Our neighbor living across the street invited us over for dinner. I already met her, and she wants us to come over. When we're done, go get ready so we can head over there, okay? But I'll be too tired by then. Am I supposed to cancel then? This is a new house. We don't know anybody in this neighborhood. What if something happens when I leave you alone at home? Who are you going to ask for help? Plus, she is a doctor. It's important that we get to know her so that when either of us is sick and we don't have the money, we can ask her for prescriptions, right? It's important to know someone since we're new here. What if I leave you alone in your room and something comes to haunt you? Some sort of white entity like the one over there! All right, we're having dinner with our neighbor. Hey, Karin. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Is this your sister, Chika? -Yes, I am. -Come in. I'm so happy you moved in across the street. I don't like having that house empty. Now I have you lovely ladies as my neighbors. You should come here more often. All right, Chika? -Okay. -It's quiet here. I don't have a daughter. That's why I'm the most beautiful and talkative in this house. Let's have a seat. By the way, where do you go to school? At Permata Bangsa High School. You go to the same school as my son. Sweetie! You guys go to the same school. That's not bad. You can get a ride to school. Fix your clothes. You're meeting a guy. You have to look presentable. This is my son. Come here, sweetie. Sweetie, these are our new neighbors. Come here. Let's meet our new neighbors. Come over here. This is Karin. -Yoza. -Karin. -Karin is also with her little sister. -Oh, really? -Yes. -Hello. -This is Karin's sister. -Hi. I'm Yoza. Let's eat! The food is ready. Let's go to the dining room. Is your husband joining us? He's taking a shower. He came home a bit late, but he'll join us later. Let's just eat. Come on. I cooked everything. Hey, if you need anything at school, don't be shy to ask me. If you want to ask about any lessons, just ask me. Right. Thanks. Wait, I feel like I know your voice. Have we met before? No, this is our first meeting. Really? You sound familiar. By the way, I didn't catch your name. -I'm… -Sorry, Yoza. But what happened to your eyes? Somebody sprayed mosquito repellent. Mosquito repellent? Yes. His eyes turned red. He couldn't see for two weeks because his eyes were swollen. Thank god it wasn't permanent. Gosh, how did that happen? I don't know. I was just walking when suddenly, somebody came up and sprayed me. Must be a lunatic. You should call the police. Before you do, if I ever meet that person, I'll spray pesticide on that person's eyes so he'd go blind. That's right. You should just use this fork and stab both eyes. I know! My husband even has a gun prepared. If we meet him, he's dead meat. Mom, I think we can remove the bandage today. You're right, Za, it's time. Let's go to the living room and remove it. Okay, Za, take it easy. Excuse me, I think I have to go. Why are you leaving so soon? You should get to know each other. Stay for a while. Let's take a seat in the living room. Slowly, Za. -I'll do it for you. -Okay, Mom. -Hold it. -Okay. Once we remove it, you should open your eyes slowly, okay? Okay. I have to go home. Stay for a while. We just ate. My tummy aches. Can you hold it in? I want to see what happens. This is interesting. They're removing the bandage. It's cool. Can you stay for a while, please? I want to see my new neighbors. Za, now open your eyes slowly. Okay, Mom. What do you see? Can you see Chika, our new neighbor? Za? I'm sorry, I have to go. I'm not feeling well. Excuse me. Yoza, don't forget your shades! Hey! You moved out of your house and ran away from your responsibilities. Don't you remember you still owe me ten million rupiah? And look at my eyes! I went blind for two weeks! They had to give me a bell just so I could call for my mom. Well, I came over to let you know I moved in. So if you need to look for me, you don't need to go to the old house. Then how did you know I live here? I never told you my address. Well… Well, I just found out that you live here. I mean… I mean, it's a coincidence that we're neighbors. -So… -So what? Stop lying. You got caught red-handed. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Whose car is that? My dad's. Run! -It's our car! -Our car? This is your fault. How is this my fault? This is all you! You even moved houses. Lucky me you moved right across the street. I didn't move because I wanted to run away. If I knew you lived across the street, I wouldn't have moved here. Enough with your excuses. I don't care. -Follow me. -Don't touch me! Should I tell them what you did? My dad is super strict. Are you scared? You're lame! Chicken! Your name even sounds lame. Chika Chicken! -Shut up. -Follow me. -Where are we going? -Your house. Don't you have a computer? I do, but I haven't set it up. We just moved. Set it up right now, we're making an agreement. Sign here. Letter of agreement? It's a good offer. Pay me back ten million rupiah for that broken Handycam within six months. If you agree, I will forever keep the secret about who destroyed my dad's car. But if you disagree, I'll tell them what you did. Don't forget. You shouldn't tell anyone that I was on my way to New York. Why? I was going to meet my brother's friends to make a film, but my dad hates me making films. Why? Because he wants me to become a doctor just like them. Stop asking questions. This isn't fair. You're just guilty! This is so tacky. If you want an agreement, you need a lawyer. I told you, my uncle is a lawyer, and my aunt is a policewoman. We even have a judge as our neighbor. Do I need to call them here? Fine, where's the pen? Why are you standing so close to me? I'm just making sure you're signing it. You don't have to stand this close. You might fall in love with me. Listen. Even if the world ends, I won't fall in love with you. I can't even stay in the same room as you. Add it to the agreement. If I ever fall in love with you, I will remove my clothes, and I'll jump into the nearest river with only my underwear. Like this. One for me, and one for you. Okay? Ayunda Putri? She's visiting you? Relax. Does she go to our school? What's she doing there? Do you know her? Of course, I know her. She's my girlfriend. -Hi, Nda. -Hi. I thought you had a shoot? Yes, I just finished. We shot the last scene. Really? Why didn't you call? I just wanted to know if you're still coming to my birthday party. Of course, I am. What's wrong? I need to tell you something, but I don't know how. You know that I hate small talk and I always get to the point. What is it? I'm breaking up with you. I can't really explain why. I'm sorry. Ayunda? I came to give you this. It's an invitation to my birthday party. You should come. I love you, Dan. This is the Prayudas. We're not at home. Please leave a message after the beep. Hello, Yoza? It's Chika. I'm sorry I saw you getting dumped by Ayunda. I just felt bad I was there. Anyway, you're a boy. Don't cry. Bye. -Hello? -Don't bother cheering me up. Just figure out a way to pay me back. This is so annoying. All he thinks about is his Handycam. Does he think I can't pay him back? Chika? Chika, can you go to Ayunda's party on my behalf? Whose party? Ayunda Putri. She invited me to her birthday party. I have a lot to do, so I won't be able to make it. It's this Saturday at 7:00 p.m. Karin, I don't even know Ayunda. Just say that you're my sister. She won't kick you out. She'll understand. But I can't. I'm working on my comic. I need to focus. You only have to be there for a while. Just show up, say congratulations, and then you can leave, okay? I feel bad that I can't come since she invited me. But I really can't. She's my number one customer, so please just show up. Okay? That's on Saturday at 7:00 p.m. It's you again. What are you doing here? I'm here on behalf of my sister. Yoza. Are you sure you're okay? After what happened between you and Ayunda, I thought you weren't ready to see her again. Whatever. Thanks. Ayunda. -What are you doing? -Just for a second. What the hell? Ayunda, happy birthday. -Thanks. -I'm Chika, Karin Aditya's little sister. Karin can't make it tonight. That's why I'm here. She said she's sorry she couldn't make it. That's all right. -Here you go. -Thank you. Hey, babe. Nda, happy birthday. Thanks. What is wrong with you? -What the heck? -Are you hungry? All right, let's go get a bite. What was that for? Oh, I know. You're not here because you wanted to come. You're here because you knew I was coming, and now you're using me to make Ayunda jealous. You're so lame! Why did you have to pick me? Why didn't you use another girl? Thanks. Can I get a chocolate milkshake instead? Danar? Chika? Why are you here? Are you Ayunda's friend? Yes, she's my classmate. That means we go to the same school? -I just moved. -Really? Thanks. -Let's talk over there. -Okay. Once again, thanks for helping me. You're welcome. Right, I saw this one sketch that you had. Those are just scribbles. I have more of my drawings. I love writing comic books. I tried sending them to publishers, but I keep getting rejected. But your style is unique. My style is influenced by Italian comics. I think Italian artists, writers, and painters are my inspiration. If you want, I can give you a hand. My sister runs this publishing company. If they like your work, they can publish it. I have friends who sent me their work not too long ago. -Are you serious? -Yes. Danar, hi. Can I talk to you? Just a moment. Where are they going? How would I know? I think I'll just cut to the chase. You might need time to think about this. But if you already have an answer, please just tell me. You know how I feel about you. -Yoza? -So… I was wondering… I'm flattered that you like me, Ayunda, and I'm forever grateful for that. But I'm sorry. I can't reciprocate your feelings. Let's just be friends, okay? I don't want to disturb them. We're not disturbing. We're just eavesdropping. Ayunda? Yes, it's fine. I'm fine. Can you be quiet? Yoza? What are you doing? Dating Chika. Let's go, Chik. Chik. Hey, Chik. Chika Chicken! What is the matter with you? Why did you kiss me? Why did you have to kiss these virgin lips? Why did you do that in front of Danar and Ayunda? Why did you embarrass me? Why do you always piss me off? Why do you always do whatever you want? I can never understand you. Never! -Can you calm down? -How can I calm down? Do you not realize what you have done? If you want to make Ayunda jealous, don't cross the line! Stop talking about Ayunda! We're done! Speak for yourself. What were you doing with Danar? What's wrong? Are you jealous? Jealous? What the heck? What's wrong with you? You don't need to pretend to throw up. Then what? Do you want me to be jealous? Did that hurt? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Let me look at it. Forget it. Let's just go home. The longer I'm with you, the madder I get. What's wrong? We're out of gas. What? You need to push the car. What? Push harder! I'm a girl! You should be the one pushing! If I push, then who's going to drive? Me. Can you even drive? Do you have a license? Do you really want the police to arrest you? Be careful, I don't want any scratches. This is my mother's car. What now? My heel broke! Who told you to wear high heels? Just push! We're almost at the gas station. Otherwise, I'll run over your foot. We're here. Get out. Wake up! Chik, wake up. We're home. Wake up! Stop sleeping. We're already here. Can you be a little gentle? It hurts! You even hit me with your clutch earlier. Now get out! -What now? -Fix my shoe! Hey! Honey. Are they dating? It looks like they're fighting. I don't know. But I'll be happy if they're dating. I like Chika. You should invite Chika and Karin for dinner again. Really? Yes, okay? Don't forget. Yoza. Come in, sweetie. SCHOOL'S ANNIVERSARY BALL Yes, that's Yoza's new girl. -She doesn't suit him. -I know, right? Can you believe Yoza dumped Ayunda for her? I'm sure she's going to the ball with Yoza. Look at this. How did she make Yoza fall for her? Yoza even kissed her in public. Look. Did she use black magic? RELATIONSHIP DESTROYER -Come here. -What? Where did you get this? From the kids who started talking about me once they saw me. Do you know what this means? My life is ruined! I'm not only the hot topic of the school but also the whole country! I don't want people to think we're dating and that I'm the reason you and Ayunda broke up. I don't want to be a victim! Just relax. The photo came out nicely. I should have kissed you a lot deeper. It would have looked better. How dare you say that? Are you crazy? Chik, gossip like this fades away fast. When I was dating Ayunda, people talked about me all the time. -I'm used to it. -But I'm not used to it. I just don't want people to think we're dating. I don't want to! What's wrong, Za? Nothing. The news about you and Chika is the work of jobless reporters. I'll clear it out. I promise. Can you also tell them that there's nothing between me and Chika? Are you sure there's nothing? Yes, there's nothing. If there's nothing between you, then why did you just kiss her? I saw you. You're lucky I'm not a teacher. We're at school, Yoza. Danar. Chika, what are you doing here? I'm going to the bathroom. MEN Wrong bathroom. The ladies' room is over there. By the way, here's the comic book that I mentioned. Here. -I'll pass it on to my sister. -Thanks. I'm counting on you. I've got to go. -Chik! -Yes? Is it true that you're dating Yoza? Oh, that. Not at all. I even slapped him in the face. He kissed me without permission. Then would you go out with me tomorrow? What about Ayunda? Ayunda understands that she can't make me like her back. All right. Where are we going? Za? Yes, Dad? Dinner's ready. Okay. What is it? Nothing. I'm just happy we're here. Do you often go on dates here? This is my first time. -Really? -Yes. First times are usually hard to forget. This is delicious. Thanks for ordering this. I don't know what's good here. Do you like it? I love it. It tastes like… Like chicken, but different. Maybe it's the spice. That's not chicken. It's a mix of squid and shrimp. What's wrong? Nothing, it's good. What is it, Chik? Nothing. I need to go to the bathroom. Please, not now! Chika. Are you okay? Oh, this. I'm sorry, Danar. I don't feel well. I think I caught the flu. Karin told me to come home immediately. All right, let's leave right now. Okay. I'm sorry, Danar. We're here, Chik. Let me get the door for you. Thank you, Danar. You're welcome. -Chika. -Yes? What if… What if we go to the school anniversary ball together? Do you want to go with me? Sure. Can you close your eyes? Please? -What is it? -Nothing. Your… Your… Your lips. What happened? I'm allergic to the cold. The night is so cold. You should go. What about you? It's okay, I'll be fine. It's going to go away soon. -But… -I promise, I'm fine. -All right, see you at school. -Okay. My keys. Chika. What are you doing here? I lost my keys. You lost your keys? Karin is working late. I can't go inside. Why are you so clumsy? Where did you go with Danar? How did you know I was with Danar? Of course, I know. Why are you looking down? Danar ordered seafood for me. I'm a little allergic to seafood. So… You look horrible! Your lips are swollen, and you say you're a little allergic? Why did you continue to eat when you know you're allergic? -Come with me. -No! Do you plan to stay here until your sister comes home? It's raining, and it's windy. You'll get sick. Let's go. No. Come on, you have two doctors as your neighbors. Don't scratch it, Chika. It's already looking better. Drink this. I called Karin. I said that you should just sleep here tonight. Thank you. I'm sorry for being a bother. You should stay at home tomorrow. I'll write you a doctor's note. You should get some sleep. Get some rest. Mrs. Prayuda. Can you leave the door open? I'm scared. How is Chika? She's okay. Honey. I found a ticket to New York in Yoza's room the other day. He said he wanted to continue Rifki's work. You should consider it. I still can't let Rifki go. He didn't want to be a doctor. He kept making films. He studied film in New York. And then he left us for good. I know, but Yoza will never know why you keep saying you don't like him studying film if you don't explain everything to him. Don't spoil him. Honey. NEW YORK IS RIFKI PRAYUDA'S FAVORITE PLACE RIFKI PRAYUDA, UNDYING PASSION AND CREATIVITY FILMING ACCIDENT IN NEW YORK: RIFKI PRAYUDA DIES ON SET Duckface, sleepyhead. Hey! You pretend you were asleep, and now, you're going through people's stuff. I got curious. Curious, my ass. Your lips look like botched plastic surgery! You look like Donald Duck! Stop snooping. Just go to bed, or your lips won't get better. Yoza. Here. What is this? My savings and some money I made selling my phone and iPod. It's just half of it. I'll pay the rest slowly, okay? Chik. You didn't have to. What do you mean? No, I'll feel bad if you don't take it. But if you have to use your savings and sell your stuff, I will feel bad. I have to take responsibility. Even without that agreement, I would still pay you back. I'll find a job so I can pay for the rest. I know how important that Handycam is to you. If your brother, Rifki, can't fulfill his dream, I'm sure you can. Everyone has an opportunity. Chika, you're awake. Let me check your face. You're fine now, but you still need to take your pills. By the way, you should stay here until Karin gets home. She dropped by early in the morning, but you were still asleep. She said she'll try her best to come home early. Okay, Mrs. Prayuda. Thank you. What is this? Yoza asked me to give this to you before he left for school. I don't know what's inside. You should open it. Hi, Chika Chicken. I fixed your heel. We're going out tonight. I want to show you something. Get well soon. It sucks when you're sick. Mrs. Prayuda? You're so ugly. Mom? You're already home? Is Chika still here? Yes, I think she's upstairs. Chik? Chik, what the hell? What if my parents come in? What are you doing in my room? Nobody is allowed here. You should have stayed in your room. If you keep walking around like this, you won't be able to come with me tonight. I never said I'm coming! Do you think I want to spend time with a liar? Look. What's your excuse now? Did you see what's inside? I don't have the time to check, and I don't care. It's probably just trash. Hey, don't say that. You haven't even seen it. Why would I watch something made by a liar? How could you lie to me? You said that your Handycam is broken and asked me to pay you back. Look. This is as good as new. What do you want from me? Can't you answer me? You're so mean. Every day, I keep thinking of ways to pay you back. I sold my stuff, I used up all my savings, and you… I didn't mean to. Then what? If you want my money, you should have just said so. You didn't have to make an agreement and lie to me. I don't want anybody's money. Then what? If you want to tell your parents that I broke their car's window, then I'm fine. I don't care. They already know that you're leaving for New York. Did you tell my parents? Chika! Chika. What's wrong? Danar dropped by and he told me to give this to you. He was in a hurry, so he couldn't give it to you in person. YOUR COMIC WAS REJECTED. I'M SO SORRY, I TRIED MY BEST. Chik? Why are you crying? Hey. LETTER OF AGREEMENT Chika. Chika. Hey. Yoza asked me to give this to you. Chika. Yoza must have had his own reasons for everything that he did. Chika, you should get dressed. We're invited to have dinner at Yoza's. His parents invited us over. Tell them I'm sick. If I tell them that, they would be worried. Come on, it will only be for a while. Come on. They love you very much. They would be disappointed if you didn't come. Why are you crying, Chika? I can't see them. I lied about Mr. Prayuda's car. I'm embarrassed for disappointing them when they have been nothing but good to me. I've always wanted to have parents like them, but I've only disappointed them. Don't be sad. All right, we'll stay home. There, there. What do you want for dinner? We can watch a movie if you want to. Hi, Chika. Danar? You said you would go with me to the ball. It's in an hour. Aren't you going to get ready? Right. Gosh, I forgot it's tonight. Let me go and get ready. Come in. Should we invite Yoza to come with us? What? No. Hold the door! I just finished cooking with Mrs. Prayuda. Look what I've got. Hi, Danar! It's chaos at Yoza's. Somebody's going to New York. New York? Yes, Yoza is busy packing. They said he's spending a month there. Do you want some? Here. It's delicious. Are you not going to see Yoza? You haven't seen him for ages. I think he's leaving tonight. It's delicious. When was the last time you talked to him? You might regret it. No, I won't see him. -Chika. -Hi. -How are you? -Hello? -I'll see you around. -Okay. -Later. -Hello? -Chika. -Yes? I have to take this. -Chika, hi. -Hi. Are you here with Danar? I know that he has feelings for you. He doesn't. It's okay. Did you eat already? Should we go together? I'll catch up with you. -Okay, see you there. -Okay. -By the way, Chika? -Yes? Lately, I've noticed that you've been looking a little sad. Cheer up, okay? Thanks, Nda. -Chika. -Yes? That was my sister. She said your comic is getting published! -But that time… -There was an error. The comic that got rejected was my friend's, not yours. She made a mistake and returned the wrong script. I'm so sorry. Are you happy? Of course, I am! I'm so happy that I'm speechless. Thank you so much, Danar! You're welcome. Are you really happy? Yes, I am. Even though Yoza isn't here? I know that you've been thinking about him, Chik. -No, I haven't. -Stop denying it. You should go to him. Chika. Don't ignore him for too long. You'll just hurt yourself in the process. For me, getting to know you, having dinner with you, and coming here with you is good enough. I can't keep you here when your mind is somewhere else. Why are you so nice, Dan? -But you… -Enough about me. I can still have fun here. Now you should go. Yoza is waiting. Thank you, Danar. Chika. Yes? Good luck. Taxi! Sir, please hurry. In! Gosh. Mrs. Prayuda, is Yoza home? Has he left? Can I see him? He's in his room. Yoza? Yoza. CHIKA: A THOUSAND FLOWERS Her name is Chika. I met her in a taxi. She's funny, cute, and beautiful. But she's also annoying. She destroyed my Handycam. Chika is my new neighbor. It's tough facing her. If I'm nice, she'll get cocky. If I'm mad, she'll be even madder. But she can be silly too. We always fight every day. When she sulks, her lips curl up like a duck. But if I'm not fighting with her, or annoying her, or not hearing her voice, I feel empty. I'm scared I can't listen to her voice again, I'm scared that I can't see her again, and I'm scared she'll hate me. I've been recording her secretly and have been making this film about her. I replaced my Handycam because I still had the warranty and used it to film her. I didn't mention it because I thought if we resolved the problem, I wouldn't be able to get close to her like this. I always call her Chika Chicken. I don't call her that to mock her. It's because I think she's like a little chick, cute and loveable. She always makes me smile. For me, she's a thousand flowers. For all the bad things that I've done to make her mad, I can only say sorry. I can only say… that I love her. Chik. Why are you in my room again? Stop snooping around, will you? You even played this film. Do I have to get permission when the film is about me? You didn't need to watch it. You said it's trash. It's not trash at all. Then? You never appreciate what I make. Just go. Yoza? Stop being mean to me. I want you to be nice. Don't leave for New York now. We need to talk about a lot of things. You can't leave for New York and stay for a month there. Who's going to New York? Karin said someone's leaving. She also said you were packing. Of course, I was packing. My dad is leaving for New York. I have to help him pack. He has work to do. So it's your dad who's leaving? I just dropped him off at the airport. If it was me, I would already be flying by now. Where are you going? I'm not done yet. You're always so selfish. Yoza! Za, where are you going? NO ENTRY Yoza? Can we go back? I'm scared. Karin said this place is haunted. NO ENTRY Yoza, where are you? What if this place is really haunted? Yoza? This place is called the garden of a thousand flowers. It's been here since I was little. In Japanese, Chika means a thousand flowers. They put up the no entry sign because children used to come here and ruin the flowers. Come here. Are you happy I took you here? I am. Really? Yes. But… But what? Why didn't you take me here sooner? Why didn't you tell me that you love me? -Well, I… -Yes? About that… When did I say I love you? You said so in your film. But… But what? I mean… I… It's okay if you can't answer. Even if the world ends, I'd never know about your feelings for me if I didn't watch your film. So? So what? What about your feelings for me? Chik. Chika? What was that for? A sign that I love you. -Love? -Yes. -Don't be nervous. -I'm not nervous. -All right, don't be awkward then. -I'm not! Okay, you're not awkward. But you're shy. Don't be. Look at you getting red. I look fine. Stop teasing me! Don't laugh. Stop laughing or I'll tickle you. Stop! For some people, it's possible to achieve what you want in life. But for others, it's a hard task. I'm lucky that I'm able to make my dreams come true. First, my comic book got published, and that opened up doors for me. 2 YEARS LATER That was the beginning of my future. I still have a long way to go. I'm very happy with your recent projects. I think you are ready for the final test this semester. I'm sure you will all become successful writers. Keep up the good work until the end of the year. -What is this, Chika? -It's mine. It was published in Jakarta two years ago. Meet me tomorrow. I'll introduce you to my friend who owns this huge publishing company. I think he'd be interested in your work. Oh, that's fantastic. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow then. I see you have talent, and I can see you becoming a great comic book author. Thank you. All right, everyone. Tomorrow, we're having a special guest, Bruno Foletti. I encourage you to come and not skip class. When color grading, you should try pulling from the middle. -Hello? -Chika, where are you? My class just finished. I'll be there at your fashion show. Gosh, I'm so nervous! It's my first show. Come with me after the show. I want to go get Indonesian food. And let's talk! We haven't talked in a while. Okay? Bye! After graduating high school, I got a scholarship from an art school in Italy. Karin landed a great job here with the local fashion designers, so she started her career here. That's how Karin and I ended up in Italy together. We're staying in Venice. I'm happy that Karin's career is taking off. I'm even happier because even though she's busier than usual, she always makes time for me. We're inseparable. After all, we're family. Speaking of family, I used to say I wanted to have parents again. The type who would love me and care for me. I have them now. Even though they live in Jakarta, I still feel they're close to me. -Chika, did you eat? -I did, Mrs. Prayuda. Tell Karin I wish her good luck for today. Good luck to you too. You should take care. Okay, you should take care in Jakarta as well. Mr. and Mrs. Prayuda forgave me for what I did to their car. Ever since, they've filled in for mom and dad. They call me every day by phone or video call. And one other thing. About the true love that I've always dreamed of, well, he is… -Is Yoza there? -He's out. Too bad. I wanted to talk to him. You talk to him every day. You still miss him? It's been weeks since our last call. Every time I call or text him, he's always busy. I think our last call was last month. He said he was busy with something. -Yeah, he's busy with a lot of things. -Like what? First of all, he's going to New York to study film. He's studying there? But before that, he has plans to meet his beloved girlfriend. Mr. Prayuda, I have an incoming call. -Hello? -Chika! Chika, I forgot something. Please drop by at Paulo's. I had breakfast there and left my designs. You left your folder again? Yes, and if I don't have it now, I'm dead. -Please go there now. Now! Okay? -Okay! Mr. Prayuda, I have to go. Karin left her designs. I'll call you tomorrow! Bye! Hello, gorgeous. Paulo. Karin had breakfast here and left her folder. I'm here to pick it up. Someone took it already. Someone took it? Who? He said Karin told him to take it, so he's off to San Marco now. All right, thank you. You're welcome. Bye. -Bye! -Bye! Sir… Gosh, why isn't my call getting through? My true love is here. Now he's here whenever I need him. Now, he calls me a thousand flowers, and not Chika Chicken. I really got my life back. I'm very lucky. I am forever grateful for this. Venice. It's such a muse. I've learned so many things I didn't know before. I've seen things I've never seen before and felt things I've never felt before. And believe it or not, Yoza fell in love with Venice, just like I did. He even knows more about Venice. He knows the history, the culture, and this one thing that he says is a legend. I think he's bluffing though. This bridge right in front of us is the Bridge of Sighs. They say if you kiss under it, your love will be eternal. Like the comic that I told you about, it's hard to achieve something that we want in life. The truth is the opportunity is right in front of us. We just have to move forward, stay focused, and not dwell on the past. It was true. I moved forward and stayed focused. And now I'm no longer dwelling in the past. Oh, I forgot something. Even though our letter of agreement was terminated, the additional agreement was still valid. It's about what Yoza has to do if he falls in love with me. And now Yoza asked me to watch him. Come up. Yoza, what's wrong? I lost my underwear! What? Where did you lose it? I don't know! Help me! What's that? That one over there! Hey, wait! That's mine! Wait! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Gosh, you must be cold.
