Good morning, Division of Children and Family Services, can I help you? Hey. This is it, right? I think this is it. You're meeting him where? Kinsey's, where we had our third date. I got food poisoning there, barfed for days. Oh, thank you for sharing. He's gonna ask you. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. He's gonna ask me. He's gonna ask. You been with him for how long? Two years. But he's never mentioned it. Of course he's mentioned it, we have plans. He's gonna establish himself, then I'm gonna go back to art school. We're gonna get a loft with his-and-her studio spaces. But nobody said marriage. Okay, back off, broken dreams. It's true. He might be asking me to move in. Say no. Say no. Isn't that progress? It's the death knell. Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? He's already getting the milk, Kim. But he's not living with the cow. Ugh, I hate that saying. I know, honey, but it's kind of a law of the universe. You can't move in because if you move in with him, then he'll never ask you to marry him. And seven years will go by... Seven years. Silent tears at anniversary dinners, and then one day, out of the blue, he'll meet a Pilates instructor who makes him feel alive again. Let's just see how it goes. What did he say again? He wants to talk about something special. He's gonna ask you. Hi. Hi. Wow. Wow, look at you. Yup, Veuve Clicquot on ice, and whether you remember or not, this is... Our table, of course I remember. Yes. You're not supposed to remember that stuff. Well, you always said I'm not a normal man. I meant that in a good way. Yeah. Okay, you know what? I know I should probably wait until after we're done with the meal, but I'm not a normal man, so here goes. Okay, wait, let me take a sip. Okay, do I look all right? You're beautiful. Okay, I'm ready. I got it. I got the grant. What grant? The frog grant. Rae, I got the government grant to travel the world taking pictures of frogs. Frogs of the world. Oh. Aren't you excited for me? You know I've been working at this my whole life. To take pictures of frogs. Frogs of the whole world. And how long will that take? I... I... I don't know, a year? You don't seem happy. It's just... I thought it was something else. What? Wait, what did you think? Well, I didn't think frogs. - I don't care. - You care. I don't. I have a great life, I love my job. You get a new job? Just because it stresses me out doesn't mean I don't love it. You wanna go to school. I think I wanted to be an artist because Adam was one. You majored in art. And social work. As a fallback position. You are in the fallback position. I really love my job, okay? I have great friends. You met new friends? I know people from yoga. Oh. Angry vegetarians. I have my family. They drive you crazy. Is this you being supportive? No. I just can't listen to you say and you don't care if you get married. It's not true. Nobody means that. Except for men, they mean it. But women, we never do. I'm just saying, I don't need a man to make me complete. Listen, you're only saying that because you read somewhere that if you give up, you'll meet a man, but that is not true. The way you meet a man is you don't stop trying. Get back out there. Why would I take advice from you? Why wouldn't you? Your boyfriend's married. Don't make this about me. Point is, nobody has a marriage that I'm envious of so I don't think it matters. Oh. It matters. Ask Vera Wang. Ask gay people. It matters. Well, then, maybe I'm just not the marrying kind. You want the fairy tale. I don't. Yes, you do. You want Richard Gere climbing up the fire escape. I'd have to be a hooker for that. You want the 1930s. You want some guy who comes in wearing a tuxedo to waltz you around the room. Is that what happened in the '30s? If you wait for the fairy tale, nothing happens 'cause it's not real. Then what's real? What's real is... You know what? You make a list of everything you want and then you start shopping for it. You create an emotional budget and you compromise where you have to, but you don't go to the checkout until you have at least 80 % of everything on that list. I don't even grocery shop like that. You're still hung up on Adam. I'm not hung up on him. It's not easy to move on from someone who is handsome and had a great body, had an exciting career. Honey, he chose frogs over you. I broke up with him. Because he chose frogs over you. Stop saying that. I'm fixing you up. No. I know a guy. No, you don't. I don't wanna talk about it, Candace, I mean it. We're two college-educated women up to our necks in real-life scenarios. We help indigent children. We know the welfare system. I've read Freakonomics and Malcolm Gladwell. I read Camus in the original French. Really? A few chapters. I understand civil rights and fiber optics and the stimulus package. We're not gonna talk about this. Okay. Okay? Okay. He did have kind of a perfect body, though. What? Okay, I hate to be a stuck record on this, but we do not expense meals around here, people. I don't care if you're working late. This is a government institution. We subsidize people in need, not people with cravings for Subway. Why do you look at me when you say that? I'm not, Kim. Why do you take everything personally? I don't know. Maybe because I'm so sensitive. Moving on. Rae. Yes? I see you have a busy day. Imogene Hicks needs another placement. No, I found a good home for her. The Cranes want her out. Picking fights with the other kids. Hardaways said they'd take her, only till Monday. If you can't find a spot, I'm gonna kick it to detention where she belongs. I'll handle it. You know my policy, Do not waste time on the hopeless cases. Immy is not hopeless. One more chance. I'll take care of it. Okay, that's it. Hey, don't forget to sign up for the softball potluck. We still need desserts. Ladies. Mmm. You should definitely go for that. He's barely out of college. Plus, he wears the hat. He's part of that whole hat-rock movement. What? I'm not saying marry him. The whole younger guy thing, they're just looking for Mommy. No, they're bored with girls their age. They adore strong women. They're like gum on your shoe, you can't lose them. Nice image. Okay, why don't you just go ahead and get the two dozen cats now? Goodbye. And join a book club. They were crazy and they had it in for me. All the families have it in for you. Yeah, but this woman had OCD. You know what it's like cleaning the bathroom for someone with OCD? It's not a chore, it's a career. I'm on your side, and I'm telling you, if you can't make it work, my boss is gonna send you to court and they're gonna send you to detention. Do you want that? No. Then make it work with the next family, okay? You probably come from some perfect croquet-playing family. Actually, I was adopted. You were in the system? For eight months. I don't remember anything because my strange but wonderful family came and got me, and I'm grateful. Mmm-hmm. Why can't I come stay with you? We've been through this. I'm your social worker, not your parent. I'm not licensed to take care of you. Why would they have to know? I slot right in. You don't have a life. Who told you that? You did. Well, I'm gonna get one. Old maid. Get in the car, delinquent. Well, that is just the silliest thing I ever heard. I know it sounds crazy, but when everybody's thinking crazy, you have to too. But to sign him up for nursery school before he even has a name... He has a name, Mother. Llewellyn Rufus Rumson has a name. You're not kidding with that. Well, we haven't entirely decided yet. Yes, we have. Okay. It's a girl's name. How many times do I have to tell you? It's Welsh. It's a man name in Wales. We're in America, and it's a fat girl's name. Not open for discussion. Our son is named. Swan, do something. I'm doing something. I'm checking my stock. I mean about your daughter, what she's about to name our grandson. Trudy, don't give your baby a name that's gonna upset your mother. Oh, ha, ha, Daddy, you're funny. Ha, ha. Well, feel free to chime in here, sport. I'd rather not. Well, whose side are you on? Didn't know there were sides. You haven't been paying attention. Okay, why is this happening? What? The empty plate. What is that? Is Elijah coming? I had to balance the table. Didn't consider it'd make me miss Adam? We miss him. We thought you were gonna marry him. I thought so too. You couldn't wait. No, it's not like war, I couldn't wait. Besides, he wasn't ready. How do you know? I gleaned it when he said, "I'm not ready to get married." Okay, that's enough. Rae Ann, don't let them bully you around. You've got smarts and determination, true grit. Not every woman can say that. You have substance, and that sets you apart. A real man notices that. That's just between you and me, okay? Thank you, Daddy. Everybody can hear you, Daddy. What? Like it's some big surprise that Rae is your favorite. I'm Mommy's favorite, it's fine. There's traffic. I better get going. You can't go, we're all gonna go to church tomorrow and Reverend Maynard's been asking about you all the time. Sounds great, but I can't. All right. Okay, fine, I'll go. Perfect. Genesis 2, verse 24: "Therefore, a man shall leave his father and mother "and be joined to his wife and they shall be one flesh." In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul reminds us that it is better to marry than to burn with passion. You knew what the sermon was gonna be about. Oh, yes, that's right. The Reverend Maynard sends me his sermons every Saturday so he can get my input. That wasn't a coincidence. Maybe you're hearing this all around because it is on your mind. Maybe it's because no one can talk about anything else. Why can't anything else impress you? I graduated summa cum laude from Emory, I've won awards for my work, I'm saving lives. And that's more than a party, a cake and a dress. Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry, Reverend. It's so good to see you. Heavens, I don't believe I've seen you since the christening. Yours. I moved closer to the city. I'm a social worker. I'm saving lives. Ooh. That's wonderful. Can we talk for a moment? Reverend, if this is about my soul... No, no, it's nothing like that. No, I saw you sitting in the congregation and it got me thinking about my nephew. He lives in the city, but a hopeless bachelor. Family's trying to marry him off. Give him a call. You're fixing me up? He makes good money. He's an interior designer. Oh, well... He's not gay. I asked him. Well, I'm sure he wouldn't lie to his preacher uncle. I have gaydar. Give him a call. I do not want the fairy tale. What? I do not want the fairy tale. What? Everyone does it, there's no shame in it. Don't judge me. Let's see. Bob. Sensitive and caring. Having children is the most important thing in the world to him. He's looking for a baby mama. Next. Patrick, entrepreneur, loves travel, looking for someone open-minded, spontaneous, with European sensibilities. What? He wants to have a threesome. It doesn't mean that I do. Okay, this one's headline is "Use the Force, Luke." We do not date grown men who still talk about Star Wars. If anyone's listening or even cares, I don't want the yard-sale scenario, I want the fairy tale. * Somewhere seems so nice and new Thank you. * Someday dreams they can come true * I'll fly away to someday soon * Mmm, mmm, mmm I think that you should call him up. I should call the pastor's gay nephew? He might not be gay. Go on a date, for God's sake. It's not gonna kill you. Have sex. You know once you start having sex, other men, they can tell. They start coming around. They're like wolves. Wolves mate for life. Well, then, like dingoes. I don't know, but it is scientifically proven. You should have your own show on the National Geographic channel. Well, it's nature, you know? It's DNA. You've just gotta stop being so romantic about it. Adam? Hey. How long have you been back? Not long. Uh, you remember Candace. Of course, hi. Hey. So, uh, you're shopping. I couldn't get you to go with a gun to your head. There you are. Stop to look at one pair of heels and you disappear. Yeah, I ran into some friends. Lyric, this is Rae, Candace. Hi, it's nice to meet you. Hi. How are things on the pole? What? Frogs. Um, how are things with the frogs? What frogs? Were there ever any frogs? I can explain. Okay, we gotta go. Rae, she's my niece! Oh, you're not crying, are you? Over the frog-wrangler? Honey, he's so not worth it. I get it now, the dream has died. Men are dingoes. I get it. Oh, I didn't mean for you to totally get it. I mean, maybe she is his niece. There could be some explanation. I mean, maybe there was a frog famine. I could hear him out, I owe him that. Oh, come on. I'm gonna call him. I don't care what you think. Hi, this is Rae. Hi, Rae, this is Luke Maynard. Who? Luke Maynard. My uncle gave you... Er, me your phone number. Oh, God. Yeah, I know. I figured, hey, it's gotta be better At least he got a look at you. He said you were hot, by the way. Reverend Maynard said I was hot? Actually, I'm sure he said "pretty." You know, Luke, as much fun as this dating ritual is, I'm gonna have to call you back. Sure, yeah, you're busy, I see. Uh, is there a good time for me to call back? Never. Never would be a good time. Hello? I should just get the cats. Hi, Luke, this is Rae Carter from the other night. Um... Sorry I was so rude, it was a really bad time. Anyway, I was thinking about what you were saying and I agree. We might as well meet, what the hell? Um, how about Rush at 5:00? Um, you don't have to call me back. We could just meet there. I'm gonna be there anyway so we could just meet there. Uh... So if you show up, then that'll be great, and if you don't, that's also great, and it's all good. Okay, bye. Wow, smooth. Mind your own business. Your bathrooms are really skanky, by the way. The tampon machine is broken, so I loaded up. Technically, that's government fraud. What, I'm a ward of the state. Any luck finding me a happy family? Working on it. How are the Hardaways? They treat Spam like a food group. Be nice to them. If they turn on you, you're going to detention. I know how to handle myself. Is that why you got kicked out of gym today? I refused to weigh in. It's nobody's business. You told the PE teacher she was a cow, and that she should get on the scales herself. I'm socially maladjusted. Could you not express every thought? Learn how to finesse. Finesse? I don't think you can help me with finesse. Okay, I will talk to the principal and get them to drop the suspension because if I told my boss about this incident he'd kick you over to court. Hmm, covering for me. Isn't that fraud? Just say thank you. Rae, pick up line five. Rae Carter. Mrs. Lang, yes, thank you for getting back to me. No, she is a sweet girl, a great kid. She'll fit right in. Tomorrow after 5:00. Yes, we will be there. Thank you. You're in. Thank you. Lovely. Aw. Cute. Another martini? Uh, no, I'll just finish this one, thanks. Will there be another party joining you? Don't know. I don't have a crystal ball just a phone that hasn't rung yet. Okay, easy, princess. Sorry, I guess I'm a little tense. I'll get you another drink. Hi. Are you Rae? I am. I'm Luke Maynard. Nice place. Yes, I love the aesthetic, the whole gestalt, the general vibe. I know that one. Yeah. You look familiar. It sounds like a line, but you do. Maybe your uncle. I feel like I've met you before. Sorry, am I talking really fast? I had a martini on an empty stomach. That sounds like a good idea to me. So did you hit traffic? No. Ooh. They've got seviche, are you hungry? No. So you didn't hit traffic? Mmm-mmm. It's just that you're really late. Uh-oh. Please don't suspend me. I'll have to go to summer school. If I had insulted a complete stranger on the telephone, I might float him a few extra minutes. You're right. I think I apologized. You did, on voicemail. Doesn't that count? No, not really. No one uses voicemail anymore. The phone is for letting you know who called, but for invitations, schedule changes, emergencies, texting is the way to go. Apologies, that's definitely an in-person kind of thing. Well, that, or e-mail, but thanks, I accept. I take it back. No take-backs. If I could address these rules of technological etiquette which sprung up suddenly, without a vote, is it possible that the people who invented this are actually not good at traditional social interaction? They found a way to avoid confrontation by imposing these restrictions on those who are adept at connection and they bully us with these rules so they can hide their inadequacies while making us feel culturally irrelevant? No? Am I talking fast? Yes. I know you, Luke. "Use the Force, Luke." Oh, my gosh. That's you. My friend did that. She created my profile. Never used it. I never used it, either. Okay. Well, you... are beautiful. What? What? My uncle, he said that you were beautiful and you are. Thank you. You're welcome. That sounds like a line. Doesn't mean it is. You feel comfortable saying that to any woman? Well, not to ugly women. Wow. This is a mistake and I apologize, but I have to go. What did I do? Nothing. I'm just exhausted by the whole dance, so I should just sit this one out. Could I just ask you a question? What is wrong with men? Oh, boy. Hey, Jimmy? Wait, you know him? I designed this place. I'm a regular here. Do you want me to answer that? You designed this? Okay, first off, we are told to stop crying by the age of, like, three. Then every time an adult male leaves the house, he says, "You're in charge." But deep down inside you know you can't be in charge because you can't even make a sandwich. Then you start to notice girls who aren't your mom. You want them to like you, but they don't go for the normal social cues, such as being tackled to the ground or being called a nickname like Craphead. You decide to give her a gift, but she laughs at the rock you brought her even though it's the coolest rock and it has all kinds of glittery stuff Anyway, let's assume that you work your way through that minefield and you get a woman to notice you. Then your guy friends start calling you names. So you spend your life trying to satisfy these two groups of people and then you grow up, throw work into that mix and you're pulled in three different directions, and you're just too tired to know what a woman wants from you, particularly if you've only spoken to her for five minutes. But we know we would die in a ditch without women, so we keep trying. Thanks, Jimmy. Ah, yes. That was amazing. Mmm. Really. How long did it take to memorize that? Three days, tops. Well, you've given me a lot to think about, so I'm gonna go. I had a nice time. Thank you. Goodbye. Wait, you're leaving? But we're just getting started. That went well. Really? I'm gonna marry that girl. Yeah. Oh, was he cute? Yes, he was cute, but you're not listening, Mother. He was aggressive. He lectured me a little. He might be a jerk. Do you want me to date a jerk? We do know his family. God, son of a... What's he doing in there? Woodworking. It's his latest hobby. Men have to have hobbies, otherwise they have affairs, which I suppose is a kind of a hobby. Men need to have a life outside you to prove they don't need you. It's in the Bible. But he might hurt himself. Well, that's his business. Can't you tell him to stop? My darling dear, you cannot tell men what to do. You can tell them what to do. No, you can't. If they do it, then they lose respect for themselves and you lose respect for them too, without even realizing. You can tell men what you need, and about half the time, they can do that. Good average. Then what's the point of marriage? It's a kind of business proposition. Ugh, I hate that. Why? It works out very well. They do the hardware stuff, we make things smell good. I'm not buying this. My darling, you are making it much too complicated. You're asking too much of men. They're not us. They're not intuitive, they can't multitask, they're color-blind. They seem broken, but they're not, they're simple. And they have things to teach us. Like what? That you don't have to have an emotional response to everything. You use tears like a weapon. Yes, but I know I'm doing that. Your father taught me that. And he taught me that things mostly work out. He taught me patience, and not to go near sharp objects and how to pack a trunk, lots of things. But mostly, he taught me that he is not a woman and that I wouldn't want him to be. I'll play that part. But you don't want to hear this, because you want the fairy tale, which is why you'll be an old maid. Bev, can you bring me a beer? Coming, Swan. Nobody says "old maid" anymore. Hello? - Hi, it's me. "Me" who? Me, Luke. Oh, I see, you didn't put me in your phone. Wow. You're calling me? You shouldn't answer numbers you don't recognize, that's one case where voicemail would be okay, because now I know you didn't like me enough to put my number in your phone, and that makes me feel weird and kind of excited. Do you wanna go out this weekend? I didn't think our date went that well. It didn't, but I like you. You got moxie. I've got moxie? Come to my house, I wanna cook. Why, because I've got moxie? Is this a '50s movie? Should I put on a skirt, let you chase me around? Sounds great. Saturday night, 8:00. I'll text you the address. Moxie. Hi, it's Rae. - Hi, come on in. It's me again. Hey, sorry. Wait. Don't touch it. Oh. Now. Hi. Hi. I'm glad we worked that out. Me too. You look great, come on in. Thanks. You're welcome. Wow. I'm glad you changed your mind, especially about the skirt. It's a pencil dress. This is amazing. Architecture's limiting. Gotta get a note from the governor to change anything, but I tried to put my own spin on it. You're good. You like the aesthetic, the whole gestalt, the general... What was the other one? Um, general vibe. Ah. I was a little drunk. But I do like your work, it's... You know, it's great. Uh... The textures, the palette, the use of space. Doesn't sound like you're making that up. Yeah, I studied art in school, and social work. Ooh. Who won? Uh, social work, for now. Oh. This is for you. Thank you, nice choice. Shall we? Sure. So how did you get started in design? I don't know, Legos, forts, tree houses. I just always loved designing stuff. Why, how'd you get started in social work? Actually, I was adopted from the system when I was eight months old. I always wondered what would've happened if they hadn't come. Well, I'm glad they did. And that they go to my uncle's church. Me too. All right. Let's get the big stuff out of the way. What happened in your last relationship? He left me for frogs. That old chestnut? You? I wouldn't take it to the next level. And why was that? I don't know, she wasn't the one. Mmm. How did you know? Come on, you just know. So you believe in all that stuff? Absolutely I do. You don't? I think it's a mystery. Mystery's good. Are you hungry? Mmm. Yes. Good. I'd hoped to time things out better, but the paella is already done. Ooh. I don't think I've met a man who can make paella. Or a woman, for that matter. Oh, it smells amazing. Oh, excuse me. Don't worry about it, this only took six hours. Hi, this is Rae Carter. Yes, I can vouch for her. She's my responsibility. Please, just... Just wait till I get there. I'm on my way. I'm sorry, I have to run. What? This girl I'm in charge of ran away. She's in police custody. I gotta go. Now? They're gonna put her in detention. Let me drive. It's fine. You're upset, shouldn't be driving. Let me take you, please. Thanks. I'm so sorry about this. It's okay. You've got five minutes. So is that your date? Immy, what were you thinking? There was a kid in that house. I knew him from another foster home. He tried to make a move on me before, he tried it again. I hit him with something. It was, like, a soccer trophy, I think. Look, I didn't mean to hurt him. I was just trying to make a point and I knew no one would listen, so I ran. You can get me out, right? I don't think so. Come on, Rae, vouch for me. I will, but you're in the system now. This is bigger than the both of us. Detention. Most likely until you age out. He's cute, go for it. Immy... Marriage material. Looks like he has good sperm. You could have lots of babies. I can't think about that now. Why not? I think about it all the time. Meeting some cute, nerdy guy, having kids, buying a house in the suburbs with a fireplace and matching La-Z-Boys. What, a girl can't dream? You believe in all that? Yeah. Why, just because I've seen a bunch of people get it wrong? That's just how you learn to get it right. I'm sorry. For what? Well, just... Tough night. Yeah, well... Thank you for dinner and for bringing me here. I'm sorry about the paella. Maybe you can make it again for me sometime or I could try to make it for you. Or I could try to resolve the national debt, which is about as likely as me pulling off paella. You don't have to do that, you know. Do what? Pretend. You can talk to me. I don't know you. Well, I'm here. What else are you gonna do, talk to your dog? He never interrupts. Well, I won't interrupt. You see the kids who are never gonna make it. You almost know it the moment you look at them, bitter, immature, self-destructive. You harden yourself to those cases. But then you see the ones who have a chance. That girl still has dreams. Somehow, she thinks she's gonna have some kind of a traditional life. She's gonna make up for all the things she didn't get. I've seen the way the system works, the odds are against her. I can't tell her that, but at the same time, I can't not tell her, you know? Would you consider marrying me? Drop dead. Wait a second, what happened? I'm confused, what did I do? I just opened up to you and you used that opportunity to make fun of me. I'm being serious. Oh, you wanna marry me after knowing me 45 minutes and only half of those are pleasant? My fault, which I'll own, but seriously. It happens. Not to me. Wait, Rae, well, maybe your story's changing. All right, if you won't marry me, will you at least finish our date? Please? Okay. Well, uh... Warmed-up shellfish sound good to you? Not really. Yeah, yeah, me neither. Ooh. How about some wine? Sure. Great. Here you go. Thanks. I have an idea. Don't move. Huh? That's nice. Good, I'm glad you like it. Come on down here. * Well, people ask me Let me take that. Don't move. I'll be right back. * And how this came We're gonna dance. * 'Cause I'm the envy with luck so hard * You better believe * Yeah * They like to call me Uh-oh. * For better or worse baby, here I stand * And I wouldn't change a thing * For an unlikely king * I must have made all the right mistakes * Yeah * And I'm livin' the dream Hold that thought and that position. Don't move. It'll be like freeze-tag. You're it. Seriously, don't move. * In life are free Hey. Ah. Hey, what... You wanna grab a drink? Uh, what are you doing here? What happened to Majorca? Malaysia, and that was yesterday. Tonight I went from my plane to a charity event and when I got to the hotel, they lost my reservation. Ah. The reservation you never made. You know I hate hotels. Yeah, listen, I got a, uh... Some... What? Ah. Hey, easy. Sorry. Harry, this is Rae. Rae, this is my oldest friend in the world and college roommate, Harry. I should just go. Hi. Hi. No, stay. Have a drink. You guys chat, I'll make up the guest room. You sure? Yeah, absolutely. So college. Yup. Which one? Yale, Princeton... Brown. Brown, that's the one. I transferred a lot. How about that drink? Oh, right, I'll get you a glass. Oh! You all right? Fine. Am I interrupting? Oh. I fell. I caught her. He caught me. Huh. Likely story. Please do not take liberties with the future Mrs. Maynard, Harry. Is that what we're celebrating? No. Well, not yet, I just asked her. In a police station. I haven't answered. Of course, because he asked you in a police station. Didn't I teach you any manners? You came to my house on my first date looking for a place to stay. No, you didn't teach me. Your first date? The other one didn't count, did it? The one where I walked out on you? Probably not. Hmm. This sounds like a stable relationship. Can I be the best man so I can console her when this doesn't work? No. Hmm. Maybe this needs to breathe or just go away. The guy recommended it. How about a martini? You're dressed for it. No, thanks. I'm tired anyway. I spent too much time in the opium den last night. He's joking. I'm joking. I spent the right amount of time there. Still joking. Good night, you guys. I'll, uh, see you at the wedding? Good night. - Night. He's great. I don't get to see him much, but when I do, it's like we're back in college. I know, I'm sorry, he can be a little bombastic. You just gotta get to know him. He insulted my wine. That's true. You know what? He will not be the best man. You don't really think we're getting married. That proposal wasn't real, right? Of course it wasn't real, that would be crazy. Mmm. When can I see you again? When do you wanna see me again? Tomorrow. I'll check my schedule. Tomorrow's good. And every day after that. Miss Hicks has had difficulty adjusting to the foster care system since entering it at the age of 12. Though she's run away several times, she's never been in serious trouble. She has no police record and she maintains a B average in school. We can't keep burning through foster families, Miss Twain. I've given her a number of chances. Is her social worker here? Yes, Your Honor. Have you had a chance to talk with Miss Hicks? I have and I'm fully convinced that Imogene now understands the gravity of her actions. She's willing to be placed anywhere and desires to graduate from her current high school. She's in her last year, and it seems outrageous... Extreme. I'm not sure it's a good idea to disrupt her life when she's so close to aging out of the system. You've worked with her? I have, Your Honor. And you're still vouching for her? I believe in her, Your Honor. She's high-spirited, it's true, and impatient, but that's because she's exceptionally intelligent. She's not a classic case. She's the only child of a single mother who died when she was 11. Before that, she was a good student with drive and ambition. I believe that's all still in there. Given the right environment, she could thrive. Question is, where is that right environment? I need a few days on this. I'm ordering Imogene back to detention and you'll be notified of the next court date. Come with me, please. Does he have any money? Mother, money is not the issue. It's an issue. It's just as easy to love a rich man as a poor man. Don't tell me you left some poor guy in the dust to marry Dad. As a matter of fact... Don't answer that. He was a writer. A poet, no less. I knew that was a disaster waiting to happen so as fond as I was of him, I said yes instead to the somewhat less handsome law student and we've been very reasonably happy. And the other guy ended up being destitute? Oh, no, he had a company that went public. Now he could buy and sell your father. Is there a moral to this story? Yes, and I'm pretty sure that it's that I don't regret marrying your father. That's not the same thing as having the man of your dreams. I never have any men in my dreams. I had houses and furniture and china and shoes in my dreams. And children. So wait, Daddy's just a space-filler? No, he's a facilitator. I couldn't have had all that without him. Let's just pretend for a minute that it's you. Mother, it is me. All right. What is it you have in your dreams? A man who is honest and kind and sexy and exciting and secure and rational and consistent and who will love me like crazy until the day he dies. I'm not finished. I want the kind of relationship where we make each other better so that at the end of a lifetime, we can look back and pass that on to our children, who will have learned lessons about love and friendship and companionship from two people who are willing to take the leap and trust that true love is real. And not just real, but the most powerful thing in the world. How long have you been like this? All my life. I wish I'd known. Maybe we could've done something about it. Well, it's too late now, and I'm not willing to settle for less. And you think Reverend Maynard's nephew is the man to give you this? I think, but how can I know for sure? If I were gonna gamble on one thing, I'd go with the trust rather than all that other stuff. Do you trust this young man? Of course. As much as you can trust someone after two dates. I have a date that I have to get ready for. I've driven all the way here to see you. No, you drove here for a shopping fix. And to see you. I can't sit home all the time worrying about you. Sometimes I have to come here and do it face-to-face. Thank you, Mother. Hi. Hey. Sorry I'm late. No worries. Am I late? Um, no, I'm early. Oh. Wow, this is nice. Isn't it? Did you design it? Yes, I did. Are you gonna keep showing me your greatest hits? Yes, I'm wooing you. Do you... Do you feel wooed? Yes, I feel very wooed. Thank you. How are things with your roommate? Uh, okay. I haven't seen much of him. He was on business all day. What's he do? I don't know, he buys and sells stuff. What kind of stuff? Buildings, countries. He's very rich. He was born that way. I'll remember that. Uh-oh. Is this our first pothole? You hate my best friend? No. I don't know your best friend. He doesn't seem like you at all. How's that? Well, you seem responsible and grounded, and he's the other thing. Well, he's a player. At least he can admit it. It's not like you have to date the guy. No, I already dated him. I mean, a guy like him. Okay, more than one guy like him. I'm over it. Good. Because that guy, the free spirit, he always says that he has to live his life his way and someone's usually getting hurt. Someone's picking up the emotional tab or giving him a place to stay. We're supposed to admire his adventurous nature. But that guy's gonna end up alone and then where's his adventure, you know? Yeah, okay. Well, I'm glad that you're over it. Sorry. It's okay. That last relationship's a little fresh, huh? No. Maybe. I don't know. You know, the point is I finally realized that I want a guy like you and I don't want you to be a guy like that. Well, I'm not. I just know a guy like that. Okay? Okay. Okay. Now, will you marry me? No. I mean, not yet. Someone's gotta put the brakes on it, because we don't know each other. We have to be sensible. You're right, you know? I totally agree. As a matter of fact, I'm over it. I think we should just be friends. Hey. Oh. Hey. Sorry. I locked myself out. I know, I'm an idiot. Oh, the future Mrs. Maynard is looking lovely tonight. Thank you, and Rae is fine. Who's Rae? I'm Rae, it's my name. Oh, right. I'm still Harry. Yes, you are. You're not gonna lose these, are you? Nope, I'm gonna go home, eat pizza, watch the History Channel. Really? Really. Really? I have a quiet side. Really? You guys just go ahead and enjoy your dinner. Okay. I'll see you later. Do you wanna join us for dinner? Mmm. I don't wanna impose. No, it's fine. I should probably get to know Luke's best friend. Oh, well, in that case, I accept. I really appreciate this. I looked through my phone book. There's not a single woman in Georgia that's speaking to me. There is one in South Carolina. I don't remember what she looks like, so don't wanna risk it, right? He's kidding. I'm absolutely kidding. What? Oh, you're not busy? I can take a break. Okay, come check this out. This is Max's wife's blog. Who's Max? My boyfriend. There was a rule about not using his name. That was when I was protecting him. But now, I don't care. Look at this. "Leslie is showing off her new diamond ring." You checked out her blog? Under a false identity. You're cyber-stalking her. You are missing the point. He bought her a ring one day after he told me that I was the wind beneath his wings. He said that? Yeah. You gotta check out my profile. Are you really calling yourself "Party in a Box?" Yeah, it's better than "Party with a Box." Whoa, whoa, go back. What? That's Luke. That's your Luke? Yeah. He's cute. Yeah. I guess you have to let the contract run out or something. I'm still on it for another month. Right. You're not active. Right. I'm sure he isn't either. I don't wanna know. You do. It will set your mind at ease. I don't computer-stalk people, okay? Back off. Back off. Fine. That could mean anything. Right, but what? I have no idea. Great. I wasn't sure. What's he doing here? I said I have no idea. No, I mean, he's actually here. Don't make a scene in front of the children. Hi. Hi. I thought we were meeting at the restaurant. I'm sorry. I gotta go out of town. Oh, when? Right now. I gotta go to Austin. I'm really sorry. I'm designing a bar there. It's kind of an '80s thing. Colored glass, flecked wallpaper, tufted banquettes. I may come back with a mullet, and a fanny pack, if you're lucky. Hi. Hi. Um, how long will you be gone? Couple of days. College buddy of mine bought a bar and he asked me to jump in, so... How many college buddies do you have? A few. Wait a second, do you think I'm making this up? Why would I do that? You wouldn't. I'm sorry. I... I just thought this was gonna be the magic date. Uh-huh. The what? You know. I don't know. Tell me. Magic date? You know, the magic date. No... Oh, the sex date. Your... Sorry. We prefer "magic." Okay, well, the sex date is coming and I promise it is going to defy the laws of gravity and create time warps. That's pretty big talk. You're the one who said "magic." I miss you already. I will call you from New York. Um, Austin. Oh, right, Austin. Usually it's New York. Bye. Bye. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Aw... Okay, you are gonna love this. I could not live without mine. You can go straight to the snuggly. And from that to the backpack. That takes you to preschool without actually holding the baby? I'm just saying, does anyone hold babies anymore? Is that out? This punch has alcohol, doesn't it? Yes, that's enough for you. It must really be hard for you. What must be? Well, I mean, you're single, and... You're single. Mmm-hmm. Actually, I'm not single. Oh, that's right, she met a guy. So it could be her next year, opening baby slings. Wow. So is this love? It's still very early. We've had two dates. We're taking it slow. Although he did ask me to marry him already. Oh. Are you serious? What'd you say? I didn't know what to say, but it was pretty romantic. Really? What? It's a little crazy. I know it sounds crazy. But it wasn't like that. It's like one of those stories you hear about the guy who sees the girl and he decides he's gonna marry her and then he does. Those aren't stories, they're movies. Yeah. You hear about real people doing that. Don't you and Jeff have that? No. No. Jeff's not a romantic guy, he's a boring guy. I had to give him an ultimatum. Yeah, me too. - Exactly. Why would you marry a boring guy? I love him. Boring men are reliable. Romantic men cheat. That's not true. It's true. Romantic men are in love with falling in love. After that, they start looking around. I don't know, is it that black and white? What if I want both? You can't have both. I think Luke is both. Wait until you meet him before you decide he's a jerk. Sure. When can I meet him? When he's back from his business trip. What, the man can't travel for work? Two dates, a proposal and a sudden business trip? I think I've seen this story on Dateline. Yeah, I would totally have him background-checked. Yeah. Doesn't sound like the ideal start to a relationship. Or casually pass by his apartment and see if it's really empty. Yes. I'm not gonna stalk him. Sweetie, better safe than sorry. Remember Adam? No, I've totally forgotten Adam. He left her for frogs. It wasn't that simple. All I'm saying is that perhaps your judgment in men is worth questioning. Well, I wanna thank you all for helping me celebrate my happiness. You're welcome. I'm gonna need a little coffee to come down from the high. Excuse me. Okay, next. Oh, thank you, who's it... Kelsey. Oh. Jeff, I didn't know you were here. Trying to stay out of the way. So you're washing dishes. Yup. You don't mind that? Helping my pregnant wife with the domestic chores? No, I don't mind that. So, what are you, like, the greatest guy in the world? I do my best. Oh! Oh. Hey, if I just slipped out, could that be our little secret? We never had this conversation. Oh, thanks. Hello. Hi. You lose something? No. Yes. An earring, I thought maybe. You want me to help you look for it? No, no, it wasn't expensive. Anything else I could help you with? Uh, no, I was just passing by. Oh, uh, is Luke home, by chance? Nope, out of town on business. He didn't tell you? He did. I just thought maybe he came back early. I guess not. Anyway, it's nice to see you again. You wanna go see some art? What? Art. There's a painting I'm thinking of buying and Luke said you're an artist. He did? Mmm-hmm. What do you say? You give me some art advice, I answer all your questions about Luke? Sure. I can't believe you just bought that painting. You said I should. I said I liked it. I had no idea how much it cost. We shouldn't be talking about me. I should be giving you the dirt on Luke, as promised. Okay Uh, what was he like in school? Well, kind of how he is now, a visionary. Smart, focused, set goals, went after them, made it look easy, but funny, you know, not uptight. And loyal. Always covered for me when I'd go off the rails, which was quite a bit. What do you see in Luke? A guy who knows what he wants and who he is. That means a lot. Not some guy who's just gonna take off at the drop of a hat. I didn't mean you. Well, it sounds a lot like me. It's just that my ex-boyfriend left me to travel the world. He didn't take you with him? I wanted to stay here. I wanted to build a life. I just feel like the world-traveler guy is just ultimately running from something. Oh, not you. You know what? You're right. I am running from something. What? Ordinary life, marriage, kids, mortgages, pretty much everything you value. I guess we're just polar opposites. But that's good because all the polar opposites are disappearing. Oh, no, no, no, wait. That's polar ice caps and bears. Polar opposites are just fine. - What do you do? - What do I do? Let's see, I play tennis, I ride horses, I race cars, I jump out of planes, travel to exotic ports of call. I mean, for a living. Do you have an actual job? I do. I'm rich. That's a job? It's harder than it sounds. Oh, excuse me. Speaking of work. Hi, this is Rae Carter. Right now? Well, I thought the decision wasn't until next week. It'll take me 30 minutes to get there. Tell Judge Barbour I'm on my way. Um, I'm so sorry, but I have to be in court. I thought you were an artist. I'm a social worker. I have a teenager that has a hearing right now. Huh. I'll give you a ride. I'll jump in a cab. Come on. * Come on * Come on * Come on * Can you see the light? * Can you see the light? * Come on * Come on * You know it feels right * The door is open Are you gonna take the ride? * We're playin' it all wrong that's why I'm sayin' it, come on * Get in, come on Thank you for showing up, Miss Carter. Sorry I'm late. I had this scheduled for next week. I reached my decision earlier. That's my prerogative. Of course. I've had an opportunity to review Immy's transcript. This is a girl who's had far more than her share of chances, but your commitment to this girl means something to me. I think we both realize that sometimes all a person needs to succeed is one champion in her corner. You could be that person for her. Yes, Your Honor. Therefore, I am remanding her to your custody for a period of three months, at which time we will review her status. You mean as in living with me? That's exactly what I mean. But it's against protocol. I'm not licensed. It's a bad idea. I don't have bad ideas, Miss Carter. As for the other issues, I'll take care of it. I know some people in the court system. Your Honor... It's this or detention till her 18th. Yes, Your Honor. Yes, you accept Miss Hicks as your ward? Yes. Fantastic. I love it when it all works out. Thank you. Okay, here we are. Okay. Oh, you know what? Don't touch. Okay, so this is the kitchen, obviously, and this is the living room. It's also your room, but only at night. That's the couch, you sleep there. That's Mike, he sleeps with you. No sweat. I realize you're totally freaked out by this, but don't worry. I'm gonna be the best roommate. I'm not freaked. There's no blood in your face. I tell people how to take care of kids. I have no idea how to do it myself. Nothing to it. Eat, sleep, school, that's my gig. So who was the guy with you in court? He's a friend of a guy that I'm dating. Your boyfriend? I can't call him that, we haven't... Done it? We're not gonna have this kind of a relationship. Too Gilmore Girls? A little. Hey, what's this stuff? Uh, that's off-limits. Do you draw or something? I used to. It's just a hobby. Look, I'm gonna convince the judge to give you another placement. Why? Look, the important thing was to get you out of detention. This isn't the environment for you. I'm single, I work all the time. If I were your social worker, I'd take you away from me. Okay, here's your bedding. But I think... Like any other kid, you deserve parents, not some job-obsessed single woman who talks to her dog. But I think that... No more "buts." End of discussion. See, that sounded very parental. I gotta change for work. Don't take drugs, break anything, befriend human traffickers. You're a natural at this. Thanks, Mom. Don't. See, that's only gonna make me wanna do it more. So has he called? - No. Has he texted? No. E-mailed? He doesn't have to check in with me. It's weird, you know? The guy wants to marry you, but he can't call when he's on a trip? That's what people do on trips, they get busy. That's one thing they do on business trips. Hey. - Just trying to help. She does not need help from you. I can see that. Okay, she does kind of have a point. Thank you. It's just... It's the early days, Rae. This is when he's supposed to be perfect. He is. I'm not gonna start looking for trouble. That's the thing about trouble. You don't have to look, it shows up. I'm sorry, are you in this? He's obviously cheating. Why else would he not call? Technically, he can't be cheating, because we're not in a relationship. What does that mean? They haven't had sex. Shh! Why not? It's personal. Why not? Ignoring you. Going for jewelry before sex, that's what I do. Does that work? Depends. If you count that little plastic sword they put in a martini, it works like a charm. I am so sorry I started this. Why don't you just call him? Yeah, that would be great. You could tell him all about your biological clock. I don't wanna talk about it anymore. I'm at work. I wanna work. Fine. Rae Carter. Luke. Hi. I'm sorry I haven't called. I left my phone on the plane and all my numbers are gone. And I just realized I don't even know anyone who knows you. Are you still speaking to me? Yes. Oh, good, okay. Somebody found my phone so I should have it tonight. I won't have to bother you at work. You're not. Really? Okay, well, listen, I gotta hop, but I will call you later, okay? Okay, I love you. No! I didn't. You did. Tell me I mumbled. You didn't. Maybe he hung up. - Did he say anything? No. I'm sure he hung up first. Maybe forever. Oh. Hey, I'm home, look busy. Okay, so I was thinking since tonight is our first dinner together... Oh, hi, hi. Hi. Hi. You two have met? Well, he came by to surprise you. I didn't wanna ruin the surprise. Surprise. Wow. I am surprised. Those are for you. I had to guess. If you hate them, I'll take them back. They're beautiful. Well, you're beautiful. Oh, look at that, I suddenly have something to do in your room. Hmm. Hmm. Excuse me. Mmm. Right. Come here, please. I'll take this. Come sit down. Hi. Hi. My meeting was canceled. I was calling from the airport. I wanted to surprise you. Immy... Oh. I can explain. Before you left, I didn't have a foster kid and now I do... You're right. All this caring about the welfare of children, it's really gotta stop. She's amazing, by the way. There is no way that you're really this great. Yeah, there's no way that I'm not. Why are you unwilling to believe this is happening? I have these voices in my head, and I have a history so it's... Not with me, you don't. With me, you have a future. I'm gonna go so that you can spend some time with your kid. She... Goodbye. Bye. Oh. I love you too. Don't ask. * Walked along I walked along * I sang your song And I tried to read * Why didn't he spend the night? Teenagers don't really ask questions to their mothers like that and even if I were your mother, I wouldn't answer. Most mothers aren't tomcatting around town. I'm not. That's not even a current term. I'm entering a mature and productive relationship, which I... How did you pull me into this? I'm evil. Back to your love life. What we need today is for you to go back to school and not cause problems. We're gonna go to the principal's... Kiss his ass until it shines. Exactly. I can do that, but I'm worried about you. There's nothing to be worried about. Everything's fine. I'm very happy. Spill it. There's nothing to spill. You're glowing. I am not. You are so a lava lamp right now. I am not a lava lamp. He said something to me last night that made me feel really good. What'd he say? End of discussion. You're the magnet and he's the steel? No one says that. It's an '80s song. They said stuff like that in the '80s. We're not in the '80s anymore. Just tell me what he said. He loves you. He loves you. That's what he said. Actually, he said, "I love you too." Oh. What? That means you said "I love you" first. It doesn't matter. He said, "I love you too." I can't believe you. I'm out of practice, okay? You really dodged a bullet there. Where are we? Thought you'd never ask. Come on. I can't believe you said "I love you" first. Thank you. So couple of things you need to know. I called ahead to order the wine. Thank you. What is it? No idea. I asked which would get you drunk the fastest. Classy. Secondly, I don't have a middle name. My parents named me after an apostle. Apostles don't have middle names. They did consider giving me a chapter and verse number. Anything else? Yes. I don't own power tools. Okay. Still with me? I think so. Good. These are the things you need to know if you and I are going to, you know, move forward, as in the magic date. Okay. I know what you mean. Okay, then why do you look troubled? I was just thinking maybe there are reasons to wait. Like what? Maybe there are things we don't know about each other yet. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Maybe there are other things that we aren't adequately equipped to discuss yet. Why are you speaking like the queen? It's just for me, after the magic date, that's kind of it. Uh-huh. Like, we die? What is it, some praying mantis ritual? No, it's that we're monogamous. Right. Are you ready for that? Are you ready for that? Hey, listen, if you wanna wait, it's okay, honestly. I'm fine with it. You just have to let me know so I can call the Ritz and cancel the suite. You booked a suite? You said you were expecting magic. Magic requires a suite. I wasn't expecting anything. I just wanna be sure. You weren't expecting anything, and yet you wanna be sure. You know what I mean. It's a commitment and commitments are scary. Yes. I don't like to be scared. No one likes to be scared, yet everyone likes to be scared. That's why horror movies do so well. Exactly. But everybody likes to be fake scared, nobody likes to be real scared. Okay, well, there won't be any knives or people in masks, so this is the good kind of scary, okay? But if you wanna wait, hey, it's fine with me, honestly. I can wait for you to be the right kind of scared. Okay. Okay. * All I wanna do is hold you tight * And laugh until I start to cry * Strange but I like it Champagne? Mmm. Later. * There's something about The way you make me feel Did you see the flowers? Beautiful. How about the fire? Cozy. Yeah, I asked for that. Mmm-hmm. Actually, I made it, with some twigs and a magnifying glass. You make me laugh. Wait, I gotta ask. Where you been? Waiting for you. * And laugh until I start to cry * There's something about you * What? Hey, I didn't wanna wake you. Well, now that you did, we're gonna have to think of something to do. No, I have to go home. Why? Tonight is going so well. It's going amazing, but I have to go. Why? Immy. Oh, yes, our teenager. She's not yours, she's mine. She's ours now. You're still stuck on this idea of forever. What's wrong? Nothing. No, no, no. Come on, we're not gonna do that. Sit, tell me. Spill it. What? I saw your status, you're still active. You talk about marrying me, but still looking. I can explain, okay? But I don't think I should have to. I haven't done anything to make you doubt me. This is just classic self-sabotage stuff here. This always happens. It always happens? What, to all the women that you propose to? Would I have done any of this if I wasn't serious? I don't know. That wasn't the question. I have to go. Hey, Rae. Rae. Hey. Really? Okay, let's talk about what happened. What? The crying till 3:00 a.m. If we're gonna live together, we need to have a policy of communication. No, we don't. Did you and Luke break up? No. But I take it the magic date wasn't so magic. Is this how you are in your foster homes? I'm starting to understand your dilemma. Hmm. Is this how you are in relationships? I'm definitely starting to understand yours. Oh, God. Hello, Mother. What? Right now? Yeah, is everything okay? Yeah, no, I'm on my way. Okay, we'll have to table this fascinating discussion. My sister is in labor. Cool, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna be an aunt, you're gonna be a cousin. Let's go. Dr. Joel to Maternity. Dr. Joel Can you hear me now? You're here. She's here. Hey. How's she doing? Well, she's in labor. She won't let us come in. She's asking just for you. Jeff is in there. We can't reach... He won't answer his phone, he's not at the club. It's a total mystery. Call him again. Uh, this is Immy. Oh, this is your daughter? Daughter? You're practically grown up. I'm sad for all the years we've missed. Oh, don't worry, we'll catch up. Go talk to Papa. This is insane, she's by herself? Don't look at me. She barred us from the room. She told me I was too tearful. Tearful? It's all right, go on. Where? You'll hear her. I hate you. No, don't touch me. Just give us a few minutes, okay? Hi. Hi. Make them leave me alone. They keep telling me to breathe. I don't wanna. Sweetie, breathing would be better than not breathing right now, okay? It's like someone's killing me from the inside. The books don't tell you about this. It's gonna be okay. How do you know? Where's Jeff? They're looking for him. How can he turn his phone off? Probably in a bad reception area. They're gonna find... I have to tell you. I have given you some really bad advice. Don't get married, don't have a baby. There aren't enough cute baby clothes in the world to make this worth it. You're gonna feel differently once Llewellyn is here. Who's she? Your son? Oh, right, right. Rae, I'm really scared. It's gonna be fine. You're gonna have a baby. Okay? Oh, God! Oh, my God, baby, I am so sorry. I was on the ninth hole, no reception. I'm teaching this lady. She keeps taking mulligans. Do not use golf terms, I'm in pain here. Right, right. I know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Um... Oh, God. I love you. Yeah. Okay. Mmm-hmm. - Okay. All right. I can take it from here. Okay. I'm gonna be outside if you need me, okay, honey? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, you with me? I'm fine. Look at me. How's your breathing? Rae? Still no baby, Jeff's in there. All right. How is she? Oop. How is she? She's fine, but she's miserable. Having a baby hurts. Don't have sex. Gotcha. Now what? We wait. Hi. Oh. What are you doing here? Immy called me. How... From your phone. Why... It was the right thing to do. You okay? Uh, yeah, I guess. You don't need to explain. I wanted to know if you were still active. See? I didn't trust you, you didn't trust me. It's kind of a "Gift of the Magi." Gift of the Magi is nothing like that. Right. More the Spy Vs. Spy kind of thing. It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. You don't know me enough to know I don't run around asking women I just met to marry me, but I don't, okay? What I feel is very real. I believe you. Take a deep breath and start over. Okay. Okay? Here goes. Swan, wake up, look what's about to happen. No, Mother, that is not about to happen. Do we know this young man? I believe this is Reverend Maynard's nephew. It is, it's Luke. Hi, how are you? Go ahead and say what you were gonna say. Mother. Rae, will you go on a first date with me? Yes. And then, will you marry me? It's a girl! What? What? It's a girl? - It's a girl. A girl? - The ultrasound was wrong and Llewellyn Rufus Rumson is a girl. Well, that's not gonna work at all. It's kind of a girl's name. We'll change the spelling. Is Trudy okay? She's fine, everybody's fine. Y'all come on. It's a baby girl. Hey, Rae? Dr. Cody to the pharmacy. Dr. Cody to the pharmacy. Psst. Hey, you coming? What happened? You missed the whole thing? What whole thing? Immy. Luke. Shh. She's absolutely beautiful. Llewellyn Rumson looks just like her mother. I can't name her Llewellyn, Daddy, that's a fat girl's name. Well, I just can't keep up. Meet Carter Rae Rumson. You wanna hold your namesake? Yes, please. - Yes. Here you go. Oh, she's so small. Oh, I know. She's so tiny. Who are y'all? Oh... Uh... That's Luke and that's Immy. Long story. They're engaged. She hasn't answered yet. So answer. Mother. I can wait. Really, it's... We can wait. Yeah. So tiny. Cute. Yeah. Isn't she the prettiest baby ever? She totally is. Hey, we should make sundaes. That's actually a great idea. I have them sometimes. Who could that be? Uh, human traffickers? Oh, God. It's really human traffickers? Hi. I really need to talk to you. Can I come in? Fine. Adam, this is Immy, Immy, this is Adam. I really love it here. Maybe I'll just go to your room. So, what's new? Oh, not much. I became an aunt, I have a daughter and I might be engaged. Something to drink? You're engaged? How long? Officially, almost an hour. How can you just show up like this? You blocked my e-mail an de-friended me on Facebook. And why? You don't wanna hear from me. I was trying to get over you. You got engaged, I guess it worked. I might be engaged. How does that work? I haven't answered. He's letting you test-drive the ring? Look, it's... It all happened very fast. Today, in fact, the ring part. How long have you known this guy? A few weeks. I was with you for two years and it didn't make a difference. The length of a courtship doesn't determine the success of a relationship. Sometimes you just know. Except that you don't just know. I almost know... Wait, how do you have me defending myself? You left me for frogs and strippers. What? You expect me to believe that woman is your niece and not some stripper? She is my niece. She's also a stripper. My brother's been trying to get her out of that so I let her intern with me. You don't have a niece. I'd remember. Bob's kid? They lived in Minnesota. I had her pictures on my fridge. Patty with the braces and the glasses? Now it's Lyric with the fake boobs and the hair extensions. Still, okay, you came home from wherever without telling me. I was depressed. There was some kind of migratory issue and frogs were disappearing. There really was a frog famine. I couldn't deliver what I promised, so I lost the grant. After that, I didn't know what to do. I wasn't ready to face you until I could figure out a few things. And now you have? Not everything. But a lot of things. One big thing. Don't marry him. Marry me. Okay, under Luke we have handsome, reliable, good job, knows what he wants. On the negative side, he might be crazy. And he could have a secret life. Why crazy? He asked you to marry him on the first date. That could be decisive. Or bipolar. Under Adam we have sexy, artistic, spontaneous. He could be lying about the niece, and he left you for frogs. The first dude. Hasn't done anything wrong. He didn't lie. He didn't tell the truth. I'm definitely using that one. Can I address the elephant in the room here and, no, that's not me. Luke might be the rebound guy. The rebound guy always brings the original guy back into the picture. That is actually true. Isn't the rebound guy sometimes the right guy? Depends on the movie. This isn't a movie, this is a fairy tale. Sometimes there's a third guy in the scenario, you have meaningless sex with just to clear your head. Nice try. Come on, put me on the board. Okay, this is nuts. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know if you're making charts, you're not ready to get married, so I'm gonna give the ring back and tell Luke what's going on. I'm not putting that on the board. Oh! Uh... Hi. Hi. I thought you might need this. Why? Why not? You're a great guy. Was that ever in question? Come in. Okay. I need to talk to you about something. Okay. Oh. What smells like heaven? Cassoulet. I believe you remember my former best friend, Harry. Hello, the future Mrs. Maynard. - Hi. So former? Did you guys have a falling out? Yes. He thinks I'm marrying out of my league. Obviously. And he won't be my best man. I'm trying to talk him into it. I can't commit to something like that. You know how I am. - With women. You can commit to me. I'm your best friend. Former. I saved his life once. Dared me to lie down drunk in the middle of the road. I was nearly run over by a cop. He shouted at the last minute. I bailed you out of jail. I'll name my first child after you. First you know about. Exactly. You finish this off? Mmm-hmm. I'll run out and get some. I'll come with you. No, stay. Have your drink. I'll be back in a few minutes. You're having second thoughts. What? I see it in your face. No, you can't. And your body language. You've downed half your drink, you're not wearing your ring. There was a ring? Yes, but... And it's in your pocket. Purse. You were gonna ask for time to think. You can't possibly know all that. How can you know all that? I've been dumped. Oh, so you've been engaged? No, no, just dumped. I know all the signs and I heard you say the terrible sentence. What terrible sentence? "There's something we need to talk about." He didn't hear it because he's in love and he's in denial, but I heard it. I haven't decided yet. I need some time, that's all. What is it? Old boyfriend or new boyfriend? Old. You see, we have this internal alarm that goes off when you've moved on, then we swoop in and try to get you back. It's not fair. If you don't close the deal, you don't get the girl, and that's the way it is. So I'm right to tell him everything, right? I mean, the whole story, not just needing more time, then. I don't know. How serious are you about the other guy? I have no idea. I mean, I was madly in love with him once. Then I met Luke and now I'm madly in love with him. What worries me is the use of the word "madly." The whole idea is crazy, you know that, to say you're only gonna love one person for life. I mean, who could really make that promise? The question isn't who you should or shouldn't marry. The question is whether you should. Well, you've answered that question for yourself. So far. And you're happy? Back to your problem. So, what's this other guy proposing? Marriage. And what's he done to deserve that? Nothing yet. You want my advice? I guess. Don't tell Luke. You mean lie to him. No, I mean don't tell him. Not yet. Give it a little bit of time and wear the ring. You're what they call the marrying kind. I believe the technical word is "a keeper." Don't sell yourself short. You know, I'm beginning to see what Luke sees in you. Thanks. So this is just between us, right? Absolutely. Thanks. You better not have your hands on the future Mrs. Maynard. You almost caught us. I like this one. What one? - The old one. Good afternoon, Division of Children and Family Services. I'll take Luke. - Stop voting. I'm not voting. I'm saying, I'll take Luke. Whichever one you don't want. Luke and I are engaged, Adam hasn't shown me he's different. He's there with a flower. I'd say that's different. Stop stalling. Go see what he wants. Go. Hi. Hi. This is for you. So is this. Uh, why don't we go somewhere more private. Yeah. Right in there. Oh, that's just DCF business. So this is a surprise. The good kind, I hope. I can't kiss you. I'm almost engaged. There's a lot of wiggle room in there. No, there's not. There is no wiggling. Just open this. Oh. Adam. You made these for me, remember? You're gonna need a portfolio if you're gonna make it as an artist, right? I don't know what to say. Maybe you're having feelings that can't be expressed with words. This is the nicest thing you've ever done for me, by a lot. But I'm serious about Luke. We'll see about that. Well, we have officially christened the apartment. Well, one room. It's a start. So how'd you get rid of Harry? I told him to leave so we could have sex. Just like college. Except in college I was leaving. That's reassuring. Do you have an answer? No rush. I was just wondering, maybe we should talk about things. What things? Us. We have our whole lives to do that. Maybe just the top three things. We should know those, just in case it comes up at parties. Okay, scoot over. Shoot. Okay. Let's start with religion. Do you have one? Raised submarine Protestant, meaning we came up at holidays and when my uncle, Reverend Maynard, came to town. So do you believe in anything? I believe in something bigger than all this. If you wanna get dressed up once a week and visit it, that's fine, except during football season. Next. Kids. Do you want them? You mean besides Immy? Immy's not our kid. I'm talking about babies. Oh, babies are good. They're cute, babies do tricks. Yes. I vote yes on babies. You know I'd still have a career? Yes. Are you gonna agree to everything? Yes. Next. Extended family, do you have any? I do, Rae, I wasn't hatched. I have a mother, a father, a brother and a sister-in-law, all living relatively happily and sane in New York. Well, my family's insane but I love them so you'd have to love them too. They seem super nice. They are. Listen. It's not that I don't care about these things, because I do. But we're marrying each other, right? Not our histories and our resumes. Breaking things down into parts takes all the romance out of it. I'm betting on you, okay? On us. I'm not saying it's gonna be perfect. What I'm saying is that you are the person I wanna figure it all out with. You make a good case. Hmm. Let's get it done. Even if I say yes, it's still gonna take time to pull together a wedding. Yeah? How about a month? As in 30 days? Yeah. How are we gonna do that? Not having a full-metal wedding. Ask anyone. They'll tell you it becomes about everyone other than the two people actually getting married. Yeah, my sister's wedding, no one was speaking, but it was very pretty. Yeah, I just want to get on with the rest of our lives. Can we at least have a half-metal wedding? Is that your official yes? No, that is my official I'm still thinking about it. Is there anything I can do to help you decide? You can give it your best shot. Hmm. Hi. Hey. Wanna have lunch? I'm having lunch. Can I meet you after work? I don't think so. I'm gonna text you an address. I want you to meet me there after work. It's not gonna take long, I promise. I don't wanna play games, Adam. Neither do I, Rae. Just give me a chance to prove it. I'll think about it. Not a word. Judge Barbour wants to see you in her office. Why? I don't have any pending cases. Do I look like your assistant? Judge Barbour? Knock. Go away, I'm eating. You asked to see me. Well, I didn't mean right away. Don't you eat lunch? Don't answer that, I don't care. Sit down. Hear you're getting married. Is that court business? Of course not. It's gossip and I want in on it. It's possible. Hear there's another guy complicating the situation. My ex-boyfriend. Well, I guess you know what you're doing. I know it sounds crazy. A few months ago I thought I was gonna be single for life. I met my husband on a Club Med cruise. We got married on the ship. Twenty-four years and two kids later, still together. Wow. So you believe in happily ever after. I said, "together." So listen, about your other situation, the one with Imogene Hicks. Yes. I've been thinking about what you said, and you're right. She should be in a more suitable home. Oh, I don't think those were my words. Well, whatever you said. I know this couple, the Graftons. They adopted two kids in my courtroom, both grown and off to college. They're looking for a teenager to ease the transition. They don't mind feisty. Their two kids were holy terrors, but they handled it. What do you say? I guess I'd have to meet them. I'll set it up with your office. Okay. That's all. Go eat something, you're too skinny. Judge Barbour, this isn't because of my love life, is it? What would that have to do with it? It might look a little crazy. Whole idea of marriage is a little crazy. There's no way to guard against it. I thought you'd be happy about this, the placement. Oh, I am. Thanks. * How far do you think this thing can go? * You're not the sanest guy I know * Hi. What's going on? Come in. It's very exciting. Some of the frog photos got the attention of an ad agency, who put me on contract for print work. Great advance and more where that came from. I'm also gonna have a home studio where I can do head shots, family portraits, all kinds of things. I figured, my space will be here and your studio would be here. Just like we talked about. Yeah, except now it's for real. I can't take those. Come on, just hold on to them, okay? While you're thinking about it. Come on, let's go eat. Okay. * Your place or mine? You look beautiful. Okay, you need to dial it back. I need to ease into this. I ordered champagne. That's not easing in. So you like that ring, huh? Yes. Do you like that one better? Oh, Adam. It belonged to my grandmother. Adam, you had me all the time. You could have proposed. I wasn't ready. Now it's too late. No, it's almost too late. I've moved on. Because you thought you'd lost me. I did lose you, and that doesn't make him the rebound guy. You're the one who just said it. Luke has never let me down. In all the weeks you've known him? Rae, we had a real relationship. Real relationships are tested. They go through ups and downs. We've weathered those. I haven't weathered anything. You broke my heart. I got over it and found someone else. Then what are you doing here? I love you. I'm ready for this. Say yes. Oh, my God. What? Nothing. "Oh, my God. Nothing"? What is it? I have to go. Rae, we haven't finished talking yet. Rae. I need an answer. It's not what you think. They were holding hands, practically making out. I'm sure it wasn't him. Mother, I know what I saw. I'm sure there's an explanation. Yes, he's cheating on her. That's the explanation. Shh. Lower your voice. Your father's lurking. Well, he should know too. Trudy should know. That's not a good idea. We should let her be married to a cheater? Listen, sweetheart, if what's going on is going on, and I'm not saying that it is, there's a good chance she knows. Wives usually know. Like there's some sort of understanding? Don't ask, don't tell, like they have in the military. Do you hear yourself, Mother? That is such an outdated idea. Nobody does that anymore. Now they go on TV and talk about it. I can't believe you're not upset. I can't believe you don't want me to tell Trudy. What is going on here? Did somebody die? Garden club tomorrow, and I will not go down to Eileen Wilson for a third time. I have a lot on my mind. So a flower-arranging competition is more important than a daughter's marriage? Maybe you're focusing on this because you are marrying someone that you don't really know. Almost marrying, and this isn't about me, this is about Trudy. Fine, tell her, but she'll blame you. Why? You are the messenger, and she will not thank you, she will not believe you because she needs to find out for herself. Just like Luke has to find it out for himself. About what? Adam. There's nothing going on between me and Adam, except... What? He wants to marry me. What did you say? Didn't have time to say anything, I saw Jeff. Then what are you going to say? I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say no. When? I don't know. It might be a good idea to figure out your own life before you go messing around in others'. Judge Barbour has spoken very highly of you. I wonder if she's given you any idea of Immy's history. Yeah, well, she told us that Immy had a history of running away and a bit of trouble in school. Apparently, Immy speaks her mind. We like that. We believe in giving children a lot of room to express themselves. Well, you might need to add on a wing. Believe me, we're up for the challenge. Immy's not gonna wanna be adopted. She's too old for that. Oh, so are we. Look, we're not trying to change her whole life. We just wanna give her the best shot at it. Well... I can't seem to find anything wrong with you. Are you trying? Frankly, yes. Immy means a great deal to me. Look, if she's not happy, she can leave. She won't have to run away. She can just tell us. And, of course, you can visit anytime. Okay. I'll call and make the arrangements. So you're getting married? Oh, uh, yes. Maybe. Excuse me. Hi. I need to see you right away. I'm busy. Okay, whenever. It's about Luke Maynard. Okay. If you could just fill out these forms. Excuse me. What is it? I'm having a meeting Sorry to interrupt you with information I ran a background check. Somebody had to. What am I looking at? Luke in the Austin paper in front of his restaurant with the business partner. That's his college buddy Ronnie? Yeah, Veronica. He didn't just design it, he co-owns it with her, Veronica. That doesn't mean anything. Okay. The article goes on to say how excited the city is to have him as a resident once the restaurant is officially launched. That could mean anything. Sure. Yeah, I mean, that could mean that he has a secret life with his business partner, Veronica. Or he's planning to move you to another city without telling you. What it can't mean is anything good. You own a restaurant in Austin with a beautiful business partner named Veronica. Uh, hi. I've known Ronnie since college. Where's this coming from? Candace did a background check. You know what? Never mind. You weren't even gonna tell me. I did. I'm sorry, you did a background check? Not that you were planning to move us. I'm not planning on moving us unless you want to. I can commute. What if I don't want a commuter? What if I didn't want a daughter? I thought you loved Immy. I do. That's not what I meant. The point is, Rae, you didn't know that when you took her on. You're changing the subject. This is the subject. There are things we don't know. Not secrets, it's life. I gotta take this. Have a seat, breathe. Really? What if I don't wanna sit and breathe? Breathe. Hello. Hi. Yeah... Oh. Hi. I keep forgetting that you live here. I don't live here. In fact, I'm leaving soon. What was the yelling? I found out he owns a restaurant with his partner. Ooh, that must be devastating. Have you told him about Adam? You told me not to tell him. No, I told you to wait. You're changing the subject. You can't be mad at him for having a secret when you have a secret. I wanted to tell him. Okay, so tell him now. I can't tell him, because I'm too upset. And you're still thinking about the other guy. I'm just trying to make the right choice. Love's a gamble. How would you know? Think I've never been in love? I have no idea. In fact, I'm in love right now. Really? With whom? My best friend's fiancee. Please don't say that. Believe me, I've tried not to. Try not to say it, try not to think it, and I've tried not to feel it. It doesn't work. And you wanna know what's really awkward? I have to be the best man. I mean, the guy did save my life once. All right, I'll call you later. All right, bye. Okay, so that was Veronica. She says hello and she's looking forward to meeting you. I'm gonna leave you guys alone so you can talk. No, no, we... I already explained it, didn't I? Maybe Rae has something. No, I don't have anything. I think you have something. No, I don't. Okay, my mistake. What was that all about? Hey. I've gotta go. I have a daughter that I need to take care of. Rae, hey. Rae, I didn't mean it like... Rae. Hey. Look what I have. Oh, favorite meal, bad news. Of course not. Actually, if anything, I've got great news. I found a foster family for you, the Graftons. They've raised two foster kids, and they appreciate feistiness. Uh, what are you talking about? I told you from the beginning, Immy, I can't be your parent. I'm a social worker, I'm completely unqualified. We have a good time and I haven't done anything. I barely get in trouble anymore. This isn't about you being a bad kid. I've always felt you were a great kid, okay? This is about you having a real family and a real opportunity. They can give you that. You can give me that. No, I can't. My life is chaotic. But, no, you're getting married soon. It's gonna calm down. I can help out around the house, I can babysit when you have kids. I can walk the dog. I can do stuff. Immy... You are missing the point. This isn't about me and Luke, this is about you, your life out in the world, where you can make a real contribution. That's what I want for you and it's what you deserve. Luke doesn't want a ready-made family? That is not it at all. He thinks you're great. This is just what's best for you. I'm trained to know stuff like that. So when do I leave? They wanna pick you up tomorrow from DCF. You get to skip school. I can visit you any time. Can I go to my couch? I'm not that hungry anymore. And you get your own room, not just some couch. * Sometimes * Love will send you round * Hi. Hey. Good morning. Breakfast? Yeah. What are you doing? I was worried. We had our first premarital dispute. We didn't dispute. Okay, I can't really talk, we have to go. She's dumping me on another family. I found a placement for you. What do you mean? Take a picture. Not because of us. - No. That thing that I said? What thing did you say? This is about what's best for Immy. What did he say? He didn't say anything. Immy should be with us. Are you a social worker? Trained to make decisions? Because I am. Rae. Immy. Please go to the car. Hmm. I'm sorry, this isn't easy and you're not helping. I'm going with you. That's not necessary. And yet I'm going. What was the thing? Hi. Immy, meet the Graftons. Here I am, the grand prize. I'm Stella and this is Robert. Hey. Hey. So let's get this party started. I'm sorry, do you mind? I feel like I already know you already. Boy, are you in for a surprise. Why don't we give you two a minute. Thanks. Thanks. So I guess this is it. You're gonna do great. I'm gonna see you all the time, whenever you want. Backpack. Thanks. Don't let her get any worse. I'll do my best. Hi. What are you doing here? I live here now. Oh. Why's that? You know why. Because my husband's a cheating pig. Did I know that? You saw him and you didn't tell me. Really? Don't lie. How could you not tell me? Mom said I shouldn't. It's not what I said. It is. It doesn't matter. You should have told me anyway. How did you find out? He saw you there. He knew you'd tell me. You're a loyal sister. I didn't know what I was seeing. What if it was a friend? Oh, don't make excuses. You protected him. You chose him over me. Or maybe you're just preoccupied with your own crazy love life. I didn't wanna hurt you. I didn't wanna be wrong. Mother, tell her. Swan, would you please stop it with that noise? I told you not to marry him. I told you to marry a dull man, like me. I thought he was dull. Darling, he's a golf pro. Golf is dull. - To you. He's out there correcting ladies' swings all day. Bound to happen. Nobody tells me anything. People get past these things. Marriage is work. You have to be willing to do it. Rae, I hope you're listening to this. It's not too late for you. It's funny you should mention that, because I've made my decision. About what? Who I'm gonna marry. Is he dull? No. Here we go again. You can't do that. Mommy, tell her. She can't. She can't get married when I'm getting divorced. You are not getting divorced. She's not getting married either. But I am getting married. You are so insensitive. Not gonna cancel my life because you're unhappy. You can. No, I can't. Yes, you can! No, I can't! Girls, girls, please, you're both pretty. Rae is postponing her wedding until this is resolved. What? Darling, this is a family crisis. But this is my wedding. I've been waiting my whole life. Then you can wait a little bit longer. Okay. Why don't we talk about this later when everyone's just a little less upset. Oh! Oh! I will never be less upset! Shh, shh, shh. Hey, I really need to see you. I'm gonna be home in an hour. Can you meet me there? Thanks. Hi. That was a little more than an hour. There was traffic. Um, I thought you'd wait outside. I still have the key. Figured we were gonna be celebrating. I wanted to get started early. So where's the kid? She left. She got a placement. Where's the guy? He's not here. I wanted to talk to you alone. You didn't call me to celebrate. Not unless you wanna celebrate my engagement to Luke. Not really. I'm gonna say yes to him. What put it over the top? No grand gesture, nothing romantic. He was just there for me in a moment that I needed him and I just knew. Well, he's a really lucky guy. Thanks. If you change your mind, you know where to find me. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. I thought you might be missing Immy. Didn't realize you were entertaining. I wasn't. I was saying goodbye to him. Him? Who is he? He's my ex-boyfriend. Oh, I see, the player. He showed up a couple of days ago. Really? What did he want? To marry me. Oh, I see. So that's what all the thinking was about. Whether you were gonna marry him or me. No, it was just you. He showed up, I got confused. I made a chart. Whoa. Go back. You made a chart? Yes, pros and cons, but I realized it was crazy. I went to tell you, Harry talked me out of it. Oh, Harry's in on this, that's great. He guessed. He told me to give it a few days. He knows what he's talking about. He knows you. I don't know. I panicked. I can't believe you had me defending myself about online dating and my business partner and Harry, he's a player so I have to be a player, when the entire time you're seeing your ex-boyfriend. It wasn't the entire time, just a couple of times. Here I am feeling guilty about everything and you've been seeing your ex. Guilty about what? What? Guilty about what? Nothing. I... Oh, God. I was gonna tell you about Veronica. Are you having an affair? No. I was, before I met you. It was never very serious. I was... That's why I went to Austin, to end it. Did you? Yes. Did you sleep with her? Not since I met you. Did you sleep with him? Not since he left me for frogs. Oh! Oh, God. But you let him propose? He did that on his own, and, yes, I gave him up for you. I gave up a perfectly good, sincere guy for you. Well, I gave up a perfectly meaningless long-term affair for you. I didn't ask you to do that. This whole thing was your plan. We didn't discuss my plan. What are your plans? No idea. Okay, well, do you want art, do you want family, do you want a romance or adventure or reality or the fairy tale, or maybe a little of everything? Know what? Maybe the reason no one can make your dreams come true is because you have no idea what they are. That's a terrible thing to say. I'm sorry. And the worst thing is, it might be true. Well, what do we do now? I guess I go and figure out what my dreams are. * I'm lovesick sick of love * My heart's just about had enough * I'm tired of games And all that stuff Hey, it's Candace. Pick up the phone. Rae, I heard what happened. I am really worried. You've never missed three days of work. I'm still selling H1N1, even though Jack remembers you got the shot. Hi, it's Mom. Sweetheart, we're very worried about you. Candace said you broke up with Luke. Please call us. Hey, it's your sister. Okay, look, I was a little upset and maybe I went overboard, but you should have told me about my cheating bastard of a husband. We're trying to work things out, by the way, so call me back. Hey, it's Adam. Just calling to say goodbye again and thanks for almost giving me a chance. Hope you and your rebound guy... I mean "fiance," are very happy together. Rae, it's Luke. This is officially my last voicemail. You know where to find me. * Some folks put the bottle down * Ooh * The day they wake up On the ground * Well, I never drank much * But I know how it feels to drown So much for the fairy tale. * I'm lovesick sick of love * My heart's just about had enough Don't say a word. * Can't find no one * Love * Love * Love * Sick * I'm sick and tired of playing games with love * Love * Sick * I can't find no one I can fall in love with * Love * Sick What are you doing? Avoiding your feelings by escaping into your work? You got it. What are you doing? Leaving. What do you mean? Where are you going? Not sure, but I always land somewhere. Now would be a really good time for you to permanently move in. I could go for some nights involving shots of tequila and strippers. Uh, you never had those nights. You used to watch me have those. Oh, yeah. You won't do that. You are gonna get the future Mrs. Maynard. No, I am not. She will not even return my calls. The women of The View were right, okay? I'm not going to force my vision on her. I'm not going to take advantage of her... Luke, listen to me. A man needs to sweep a woman off her feet. I tried, Harry. It didn't work. I'm sticking with The View. All right, well, I'm definitely leaving at the right time. Seriously, you're not gonna give this another shot? She knows where to find me. Go away. I went to a better place, I've gone to the light. I knew you didn't go into the light. Oh! Oh, you look like hell. Dead people look better than you. Hi. Where should I put this? Shh. Don't make me answer that. Oh, that's cute, nice. Oh, that's really nice, that's sweet. At least I'm drawing again. Are you really not gonna give Luke another chance? I don't know. He didn't tell you about his friend with benefits. You didn't tell him about your ex. You know, those two lies are so white that they're not even lies. Omissions, they cancel each other out. Okay, fine. It's not him, it's me. No idea what I want. Honey, do you love him? Yes. That doesn't mean I have to get married. I mean, what if being alone isn't the end of the world? Okay, we're gonna finish this when you're feeling a little more rational. Get some sleep. Eat something. * You're nobody's shadow Nobody's fool * Nobody's fool * You write your own story Make your own rule * Make your own rule Your next sentence could be your last. That goes double for you. Surveys have found that meaningless sex can help in a crisis. Jack, I'm being sexually harassed. Wow, you're like a totally different person. She always had bitch potential. Keep it up. You never hear about government employees going berserk in the workplace. It is really nice to have you back. Rae, can I see you in my office, please? Whatever you need to say, you can say it right here. Are you firing me? Of course not. I'd never find anyone with your qualifications who'd work for this salary. I think you should take time off. I took some time off. Some more. You threatened your fellow workers. That was a joke. I'm obligated to suspend you. If I didn't and something happened, I'd be in big trouble. Besides, you look like crap. Can't say that. Two weeks, with pay. You're serious? Very. Fine. Oh, was that for me? No, it's for Immy, I'm gonna see her later. Oh, no, you're not. What are you talking about? You're forbidden to see anyone related to this office, especially and including Immy. Leave her alone, she's fine. She'll think I've forgotten about her. I'll get it to her. In the meantime, I'm serious. Don't communicate with anyone here. We'll see you in two weeks. What am I supposed to do now? What do people do when their whole lives get obliterated? I don't know, take a trip? Have an adventure. You could go to France or Russia or Thailand. Better yet. Go to the airport and just pick a country. Sounds terrifying. I'm gonna do it. She's gonna cook somebody's rabbit. Okay, Candace, I'm doing it. I am disappearing on an adventure. I changed my number and everything, but I will text it just in case there is an emergency. But, Candace, I am talking death or really good gossip. Otherwise, please, don't find me. Okay, bye. Two weeks. It'll fly by. Eddie will take care of you. You like him. He gives you bacon. Look, I need this, and you're a dog. End of discussion. PLAYING) * I can if I think I can Turn my doubts into sand * I can if I think I can * I can if I think I can Where are you going? To the airport. Where are you going? To the airport. I came to say goodbye. Okay, goodbye. Let me give you a ride. I don't know. Hmm? Never take a taxi when you could take a limo. That's a lot of car for one person. That's true. Where you headed? I don't know. I'm just gonna pick a place. I'm trying to have an adventure. Mmm. What about you? London. I've got business there. Then I'm dropping in on the castle in France. Whose castle? Mine. Well, my family's. Your family has a castle in France? Mmm-hmm. Loire Valley. Wow. Come with me. What? No. Why not? Because the last time I saw you you said you were in love with me. You're Luke's friend. I can't do that. First of all, unless I got the story wrong, you and Luke have broken up. But... Secondly, it doesn't have to be romantic. It's just a guy giving a girl a ride on his plane. You have a plane? Mmm. You said you wanted adventure. I do adventure very well. Come on. Never mind. * I can be whatever I'm gonna be * Yes, I'm following my heart * I can if I think I can Turn my doubts into sand * I can if I think I can * I can if I think I can Turn my doubts into... * She's got a specific set of rules for him. - Like a handbook? - What are the rules? Well, like he cannot go out on a date. Can't go to dinner. Be in a relationship. - Can't be in relationships. He can't kiss her. Now, how do you know what he's doing? Like Pretty Woman. So smart. Oh! What did you do? How did you get in? Don't worry about it. Okay. Nice place. Thank you. She disappeared. Your fault. Who disappeared? What? Rae. She was supposed to see me, but she ended up sending me a present by way of her boss, so I called DCF. Two weeks off. She changed her cell phone. What the hell did you do? Whoa! Too fast. I didn't do anything. We broke up. Why? Grown-up stuff. Did you cheat? No. Nobody cheated. I was getting some healing done before you arrived. I don't think it's every man's fantasy. Some men may fantasize about it. Some men don't want to do that. Uh-oh. Put some real clothes on. We have work. What? We have to go to her place. No. She could be lying in her own blood. She could be lying in bath salts hoping that people leave her alone. Luke, you only saw her strong side. I had to listen to her cry every time you guys had an argument. She cried? Dude, like Chad Lowe at the Oscars. I'll go change. Why get married? I don't understand marriage. Thank you. I can't believe I'm really on a private plane. This plane is ours and no one is gonna get on it? I hope not. And that flight attendant is all ours? We can move about whenever we want and I can use my very own bathroom? Exactly. Try some caviar. Uh... Are those fish eggs? Yes. I have this thing about eating things before they're born. Do you eat chicken eggs? That's only after they don't look like eggs anymore. Try it. It's delicious. Mmm. Oh, it really is. Who knew? The Russians and rich people. Oh. What are you doing? Breaking in. Give me your card. You had a key. No. Any major card will do. I'm not gonna let you use my card. I'll give it right back to you. That's not the point. I don't have any credit cards, being a ward of the state. This isn't right. You're the worst detective. I'll take the rap if we get caught. I can't let you. Luke, you know what? There's not gonna be any rap. Do you want your woman back or not? Oh, look at that. Thank you. Are you kidding me with that? Oh, my God, that totally worked. I've only seen that happen in movies. Ha! Take that. She needs better locks. Tell her that when we find her, she'll swoon. Ugh! Oh, jeez! Oh, nice one. I'm okay. Whoa. Hey. She did these? She is good, and demented. Okay, don't get distracted. We're looking for clues. What? Oh, wait, what are you doing now? Hacking into her computer. You have an impressive array of criminal skills. I'm good with technology. And I'm in. How did you know her password? I've seen her type it in like a thousand times. What? She's, like, never even tried to hide it. The last thing she Googled was a bunch of destinations. African safari. Yeah, I don't see that happening. Prague, Aruba, London. Oh, my God, I just had a terrible thought. Hmm. Share. Harry, London. Gonna need a verb. He left. That's where he was going. You think that she went with him? I don't know. I was calling, he didn't pick up. I know this guy. He would do something like this. Huh. Some best friend you got there. Give me your credit card, we're booking some tickets. No. No, we are not gonna chase her. Uh, are you nuts? We broke into her house, we broke into her computer. We're in this. I wanted to make sure she was safe. If she's chosen another guy over me, then I have to accept that. What are you, Sting? Grow a pair. Plus if I see Harry, I might kill him with my bare hands. That's better. Credit card, please. No. I'll handle this. Does not fill me with confidence. I will find her. First, I'm gonna take you home. This is my home. If I let anything happen to you, Rae's gonna kill me with her bare hands. Let's go. Okay. Just promise you'll go get her. I promise. Okay. Bachelor Number 2 is here. What should I tell him? Oh, I got this. Hi. Are you looking for Rae? Yeah. She changed her cell-phone number. What's going on? Is she still engaged? I have no idea. She disappeared on an adventure. You have her new number? I'm sworn to secrecy. Look, if she's broken up with the guy, I want a second chance. What if you're standing in the way of true love? It wouldn't be the first time. I can't betray my best friend like that. Okay, okay, what if I took my eye off of my cell phone for a minute and you were to get into my contacts? Would that really be my fault? You think about that while I get this. DCF, Candace's desk. Mmm-hmm. I'm covering her cases for a little while. No, she's fine, she just went on vacation. How can I help? Mmm-hmm. Rae? Hmm? Rae? Wake up, wake up, wake up. Oh. It seemed like minutes ago I was being offered another drink. Welcome to London. London? It's a miracle. I'm gonna deal with Customs, okay? Okay, great. Hello? Hey, Rae? It's Adam. Hey, Adam. Adam? How'd you get my number? It's a long story. Where are you? In a private plane. It took, like, no hours to get here, ate fish eggs. Where are you? How did you get my number? Thank you. Never mind. Just wanted to make sure you were okay. I'm fine. I'm in London, having an adventure. Where are you staying? At the Townshend Hotel, but don't tell anyone. It's part of the adventure. Don't worry, I won't. Thanks. Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye. What do you say we get this adventure started? It was nice of them to keep the bar open for us. Well, they kind of have to. I own it. Oh, right. You look beautiful. Thank you. Wow, everyone here is fancier than I am. Ah, it's London. People like to dress up. Well, I don't have anything formal. Really? Why not? Well, I don't do anything formal. I work for the government. You seriously looked in the mirror and said, "I'm gonna dedicate my life to saving people"? No. Maybe. I wanted to be an artist, but it scared me. It seemed selfish. So I thought, "What's the opposite of being selfish? Helping people. "Maybe if I have a job helping people, "I can justify being an artist on the side." You dropped that dream? Well, Luke says no one can give me my dreams because I don't know what they are. That's harsh. I think it's true. Well, I wanna help you fix that. What did you love about him? Do we have to talk about this? I'm curious. The way he smiled. The way he'd listen with his eyes. He had this confident way of sitting. He made me laugh. He never let me get away with anything. But it never made me feel foolish. It made me feel like he could expect the best of me and I could expect the best of him, and we... Why are you making me talk about this? I'm not. Anyway, all that's over. How am I doing? I'm not very good at this fancy dancing. I have this rule about dancing. Less thinking, more feeling. I didn't know that rule. Well, now you do. So a whole bunch of people just live like this all the time? We do our best. And you don't feel guilty? No. What? It's just the divide is so enormous. I see people every day who have nothing. I see people who have everything and some are still unhappy. That's not the point. What's the point? The point is if nobody ever lived the dream, well, then what would people dream about? Do you think you could stop saving the world and get used to living a life like this? Maybe. Are you having any fun? A lot, actually. Know what I'd like to do right now? I have an idea. See your sketches. What? Your art. I'd like to see it, if you don't mind. Um, sure. It's in my room, but that's really what we're doing. Let's go. These are exceptional. You're amazing. Thanks. You could really do something with this. Maybe I will. Maybe it's time to go beyond maybe. I think I'm doing that right now. Get some sleep. Big day tomorrow. He really did just wanna see my sketches. Harry? Wow. Now, that's what I call a dress. I can't have this. Of course you can. I can't let you buy me a dress. You'd let me buy you a European adventure? That's different. Not sure how, but give me a minute. Every woman needs a dress like this. Back in my real life I'll have nowhere to wear it. Dress for the life you want, not the life you had. We're just getting started. * Every princess has a castle * Some kind of honor to defend * I would rather fight my battles Yeah * Than hide behind a thousand men * I've been hanging my hair outside of this tower * Waiting for a savior * When all along I had the power to save myself * And I can tell It's gonna be a better day * I think I'm gonna be okay * I got a little air to breathe * It's all right with me * Oh, go ahead, bring on the rain * It's gonna be a better day * I think I'm gonna be okay * I got a little air to breathe * It's gonna be a better day * Ross, how have you been? Harry, as I live and breathe. What brings you across the pond? I try to drop by now and then. I'm glad you could join us. I'd like you to meet Rae Carter. Delighted. Harry's told me about you. Oh, and he's told me, well, absolutely nothing about you. Ross and I went to university. Oh, which one? Oxford. Oh, yeah, well, I've heard of it. May as well get down to business. Did you bring the sketches? Ross owns a publishing company. They look for talented illustrators. Which I hear you are. I work for the government. Good, then you'll be cheap. Welcome aboard. Hello. Hello, welcome aboard. You really think you can do this without me? Are you kidding? Did you run away? Passport. I told her it was the only thing I wanted for birthday and Christmas. This child needs to be escorted off the plane. Dude, okay? I told you, it's legit. How stupid do you think I am? That depends. Are we using a sliding scale, point system, ratios? Anyone can forge papers. That's actually not true. But these are for reals. You can call the Graftons. I will, right now. Oh, fine. I'm not taking a minor out of the country. I'm back in the cheap seats. See you. Don't go anywhere. Come here. Immy, Immy. Hi, Mrs. Grafton? Yeah, this is Luke Maynard. How are you? Yes, I did just see her. Yes, she's onboard. Yeah, well, I don't know if I'd go so far as to say we made plans together, but, yeah. Yeah, no, I'm aware she's had a hard life. Yeah, this is... It's making her very happy, you're right. Yeah, she does. She loves us both very much. I'm excited. It's gonna be great. Okay, well, we'll call you from London. All right, great, bye-bye. Welcome aboard Flight 419 nonstop service to London. Please take your seats and enjoy your flight. It's true. I can't believe you did that. You deserve to be working as an artist. But in London? Everything happens online. You can live wherever you want. I highly suggest London, or wherever I happen to be. Rae? Adam? And who's this? Uh, Adam. The ex-boyfriend. Who's this? Harry Townshend. Pleasure. We need to talk. What are you doing here? We really need to talk. It's okay. You know where I am. Yes. I was wrong to let you go. When you told me you were gonna marry Luke, I should have tried to stop you. Because I'm the right guy for you. We both know that. I don't know that, that's the problem. You knew it once. If I proposed the night of the frogs, you'd have said yes and we'd be celebrating. But that's not what happened. I wasn't ready then. I'm ready now. But now I'm not. Ready to marry Luke. Obviously not. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. Look, Adam, give me a break. I went from "couldn't get arrested" to having three guys trying to give me the fairy tale. That guy's in the running? Nobody's in the running. I'm trying to take a step away from it right now. I'm trying to have an adventure. You, of all people, should understand that. I'm done with adventures. I want something real. I want something tangible. Are you sure? Absolutely. Because here's what I think. You were really disappointed with what happened with the frogs. You felt like you failed. Then you came back to me for a safe place to fall. I was always Plan B. But that's not good enough for me and it shouldn't be good enough for you. Don't give up what you love most. Don't give up on your adventure. And you wonder why everybody wants you. Now go find some frogs. Thank you. Oh. Oh. Hey, this is England. We gotta be civilized. Do I look like I care? We're on a tight clock. I got it. Hi, excuse us. Hi. We're looking for a guest, Rae Carter. It could be Townshend. It couldn't. You were dragging your feet. They could have children. Mr. Townshend and his guest checked out this morning. Did they say where they were going? They did not, and even if they had, I wouldn't be authorized to tell you. Well, you know what, this is a US dollar, so just start talking. She's joking. But it is kind of an emergency. She was kidnapped. She's diabetic. She could slip into a coma at any moment. Stop helping. Take this show somewhere else. We are rather busy here. I hope you don't mind blood on your hands. Thank you. She could be dead. You've been helpful. Have not. What is wrong with you? You heard "You catch more flies with honey"? Great, if we needed flies. What's next? I don't know, sightseeing. What? Never find them. This is a big country. No, it's not. Well, it's attached to a big continent. He's got a plane. They could be anywhere. He could have told somebody where he was going. Stop talking, let me think. Always nice to try something new. What if we, uh... Hey. * It's gonna take a little time * While you're waiting like a factory line * I'll ride across the park Backseat on the 79 * Wasted days You've come to pass * So go I know you would not stay * It wasn't true But anyway * Pollination yellow cab Wow. Well, I guess if you've seen one family castle, you've seen them all. Actually, that's very true. * You walk up the stairs * See the French kids by the door * Up one more flight * See the Buddha on the second floor Wow. * Coronation rickshaw grab Oh, Charlemagne. Come here, boy. Go on, sit. Sit, sit. Who takes care of Charlemagne? The caretaker. He lives out back. He won't bother us. Good boy. Okay, is this a trap? Are you a human trafficker? Tomorrow I'm gonna sell you to a gunrunner named Olaf. But we still have tonight. You can at least show me to my room, so I can change for the occasion. Right this way. Come on. Hey, Nicolette. It's Luke Maynard. Remember, we went out a few times, and then you fell for my best friend, Harry? Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Hey, you picked the wrong guy. No, I'm just wondering if you're still in touch with him. I see. If he does happen to call you out of the blue, for no reason, would you ask him to let me know where he is? Okay. Thanks so much. Bye-bye. I'm open to your ideas. Interpol? Alicia, hi. Hi, this is Luke Maynard, Harry's friend. We met in Atlanta a few months ago when you two were... Oh, I see. I see. It ended that badly, did it? Okay, well, so does that mean that you're not in touch with him? Because I... I agree, yeah. I agree, I'd like him to meet a similar fate. All right. Thanks so much, bye. This guy burns through people. Why are you friends? He never stole my fiancee before. Where does he live? He'd take her to his home. He doesn't live anywhere. Travels. Yacht? I don't know where he parks it. Does he have any family? They're all over the place. I spent Christmas with him once at their family castle. There's a castle in this? Yes, in France. You had this information the entire time? I forgot. Let's hit the castle. How far is France? Far enough. All right, how did I fail? What do you mean? I played all my cards, you're thinking about Luke. How do you know that? I read women. I'm thinking about him a bit. More than a little bit. Is that why you haven't made a move? I can't make a move on my best friend's girl. I'm his ex. Technically, that is off-limits too. Let me get this straight. If I'm off-limits, why bring me here? You were holding out for the fairy tale. I wanted you to get over it. You can't lose a guy like Luke over a fantasy. So you brought me here to teach me a lesson? Sort of. Okay, wait a minute. You should have told me that. Yeah, but it wouldn't have worked. So you were never in love with me? Oh, I was, but... I still am. I fall in love all the time. Falling in love is not my problem. Staying in love, that's my problem. What if I had fallen for the fairy tale? Well, it's funny you should ask, because for the past few days, for the first time ever, I could see taking someone on the journey with me. As a mistress? No, as the other thing. I'm not an expert, but I suspect if you can't say it, then you're probably not ready to do it. Marry me. Excuse me? Marry me. You brought me over here to teach me a lesson and now you wanna marry me? Yeah. That's crazy. Crazier than wanting to be with one guy, then reconsidering another guy, then jetting off with a third? It's all crazy, Rae. Trying to make sense of it, that's where we fail. Love is a gamble. Bet on someone or get out of the race. I don't want to get out of the race, just the living room. You know what? I do want out of the race. It's Luke. I love him. I've always loved him. I doubted myself, I thought it was too good, but it wasn't too good to be true, it was just true. I understand. I had it, you know? I had the fairy tale and I didn't even realize it. A guy who knew what he wanted, who showed up for me, who wanted me for who I was. He didn't need me to be an artist or have expensive taste or these fancy dresses or big plans, he wanted me. And I didn't know what that meant. I blew it. He let you blow it. I would have come after you. I made that impossible. Nothing's impossible, Rae. I'm going to my room. Which way is my room? That way and up. * When I hear the right words at the wrong time * When I read the poem but it don't rhyme * When I get the answer that I don't like * I let it go * By * Drinkin' in while I hold my breath * I begin to forget * I won't wake up this way ever again * Good morning, Charlemagne. What's for breakfast? Or lunch? Come on, let's go. Okay. I go to town, you guard the girl? Harry, Harry... Where are you going? Harry? Harry. Harry! Up here! Where are you going? Don't leave me here. Harry! Harry. You gotta be kidding. Okay, so, what's with the no roads and the no signs and the no GPS signal and everything's in French? It's France. We're in the middle of nowhere. The car breaks down? Cannibalism. Don't eat me. Pinkie promise? Concentrate on the map. I think we gotta turn. You think anyone of my generation can read a map? Well, could you give it a shot, please? Okay. God. So, what's the plan when we get there? It's very elaborate. I made diagrams and... You're winging it. No idea what's gonna happen. But I know what my objective is and how to articulate my position. You're clueless. I hope it works out. We've come a long way for you to "hope it works out." Hey, know what? I was supposed to be alone on this trip. You can thank me later. We should role-play. I'll be Rae, you be Luke. I don't wanna be Luke. Hilarious. I don't wanna role-play. If we ever find her, I'll know what to say. Okay, now what? Uh... Which way? I don't know, dingus. Let me see the map. All right. It's in French. Oh, my God, I'm hallucinating. Luke, Immy! Whoa, cozy. There's no one here since, like, the Renaissance. Sure this the right place? All castles look the same. Yeah, no, I'm sure this is it. Maybe they went to get groceries. I'm not looking forward to that drive. Come on. Luke, Immy! Look, it's her. Rae? Help me, I'm locked in. Oh, my God. Why? I'll explain later, just get me out. Right, sorry, okay. We gotta figure out a way to get in. Grab, like, a rock or a log, or, you know, that. Mmm-hmm. Is this breaking and entering? Why are you asking me? You're the hardened criminal. Duh. You mean "doy"? Yeah, I mean "doy." Wow. Whoa. I can see how you can forget this. - Help! You hear that? Let's go. Oh, God. The dog, I forgot about the dog. Great Danes are stupid. What do you wanna do, throw some SAT questions at him? Get something, will you? Hey, buddy, hi. What's your name? Charlemagne. Is that your name? What am I to do with this, Braveheart? I don't know. Immy, come on. What's the matter with you? It's shiny and could distract him. Oh, hey, you remember me. Oh, that's touching. Hey, buddy. Hi. How you doing? - Help! Rae? Oh, right, okay. See you, buddy. Stay back, okay? Stay there. Please stay. Help, up here! Where are you? Rae? Immy, I'm up here. Help! I gotta get to the gym. I'm not gonna make it. Yes, you can. Save yourself. Come on, you can do it. Rae? The stairs. Rae! I'm in here. Rae? Rae? Are you... Are you in there? I broke the key in the lock. I can't get out. What did he do? Nothing. I'll explain it all. Just get me out. Okay, let me think. You gonna spend time on this? Take it off its hinges. It's in every action movie. Okay, Bruce Willis. Give me a tool. Not even gonna make a tool joke. Rae? Oh. Oh! Hi. Hey. You came for me. Rae, I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. I should've told you. I should've told you. I never should've let you go. I shouldn't have run away with your best friend. That's true. Nothing happened. He was just trying to teach me a lesson. What lesson? That I already had what I wanted. Harry tried to teach you that lesson? He also wanted to marry me, but that doesn't matter. Did he say that? Just in passing. Okay. How does that not matter? I got something. What is it with the ax? Only thing I could find. In the whole castle? Are we not in a hurry? Give it to me. Hey, Rae? Stand back, I'm gonna take the door down. Hinges. Yeah, smarter. * Look at the mountain Look at the river * Look at the city Look at it glitter * 'Cause every second counts in love * It's time for a shake up * And quit with the make-up * Just watch me take up with you * Give me the ax. There we go. Yeah, I got it. One, two... One, two, three. I got it. Oh, I got it! I got it. Hurry. Nice. God. You know, I have an extra key to that. Uh-huh. Knew it. Hey, hey, easy, killer. Whoa. Give it to me. * I'll try and deliver I'll learn to forgive her * I'm gonna take it * So just watch me make it with you Aw. You gotta love the happy ending. * Here I go * Here I go * Here I go * Here I go * Here I go * Here I go * Yeah Harry. Okay, let's go. You and me, right now, pal. Come on. Whoa, are we choosing our weapons? You kidnapped my girlfriend. No, I didn't. I helped her come to her senses. You violated the guy code. No. I asked you if you were going after her. You said no, remember? Still, the girl is off-limits for at least a year, okay? Or until the guy starts dating someone else. Even then, you have to ask permission. It is Article 1 in the breakup rulebook. I haven't consulted the handbook in a very long time. You didn't go after her, therefore you didn't deserve her. What are you talking about? I came after her. Now. Which is why I'm surrendering. You... You... Oh. Mmm-hmm. Why are we friends again? I make your life more interesting. That's not it. Yes. I'm not hugging you. You kidding? I don't want a hug. Come on, I'm not interested... Whoa, whoa. Please, please, it's my fault, it's my fault. No, we're having a friendly chat. And now you're here and Luke's here. I'm going. Tell your story walking, pal. Hi. Hi. I believe this belongs to you. Rae, would you... Yes. He forgot the knee. Eh. You can't have everything. Smart girl. * Oh, her eyes, her eyes * Her hair, her hair * Falls perfectly without her trying * She's so beautiful * And I tell her every day * When I see your face * There's not a thing that I would change * 'Cause you're amazing * Just the way you are It's beautiful, isn't it? I helped plan this. Rae designed the dresses. She's an artist. She's gonna do that on the side while saving lives. But you guys know all this. I keep forgetting, who is this person? Oh, Swan. I'm their daughter. They're officially adopting me. Can you believe our daughter's going to college? I know. It seems like we just got married five minutes ago. * If perfect is what You're searching for * Then just stay the same * So don't even bother asking * If you look okay * You know I'll say * When I see your face * There's not a thing that I would change * 'Cause you're amazing * Just the way you are * And when you smile * The whole world stops And stares for awhile * 'Cause, girl, you're amazing * Just the way you are
