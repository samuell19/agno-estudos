(cheerful nostalgic music) (horse hooves trotting) (wagon wheel rattling) (cheerful nostalgic music) (flames crackling) (hammering) (sizzling) (hammering) (horse whinnies) - Morning. - Morning. Eh, I heard you folks are leaving Springfield. - You'll have what I owe you before then. - Oh I wasn't asking that. Where for? - Territory of Maine. - That's all wilderness out there, isn't it? - We'll be the very first out there. - They've offered claims of land. I had my brother buy us one. This'll do. - You won't be afraid out there all on your own? - Nothing to be scared of, right pa? - We want you to have it. - It's one of Will's finest pieces. - Well, we can't carry it all the way to Maine. - What do they say the Indians out there? - Don't frighten her, Abe. - There's been no trouble since the French war, nearly six years of peace. Will's brother says it's Heaven. - Well I'm not sure I'd take to his idea of Heaven. - Ethan's a good man. - Come along, Katie. Let's go find a place to put this chest. - So you've made your plans? - Will and Matt will go ahead to the claim and build the cabin and wait for us there. Ethan will come and take Sarah and James and me to our new home. - So you'll be traveling all that time with Ethan, weeks? - That doesn't matter anymore. - [Boy] Robinson Caruso made out fine in the wilderness, didn't he, pa? Of course he did have to fight the savages. - Now keep your mind out of that book and stick with what's real. Tell me what an Ash Tree's for. - Ash, that's good wood for tool handles, pa. - And Walnut? - Fine furniture, like when you made that table for the Duncan's. - Good. Now, find us a good sturdy Oak for the Henderson's table and chairs. - Pa, how long until we have some neighbors out there? - Now mind how you walk with that ax! - Yes sir. I'm just wondering, about a year you think? - Just stick with the work that's in front of you, Matthew. You're supposed to be finding us that Oak Tree. - I'm leaning on it, pa. - Well leaning on it won't bring it down now, will it? Find your balance. Take the first stroke. (thumps) (grunts) (thumps) - Pa. (birds chirping) - It's all right, Matthew, it's Tadonka, your Uncle Ethan's friend. (birds chirping) (whistles) - Uncle Ethan! (laughing) - (shrieking) Oh, Ethan! Oh, what are you doing here? - Sarah. - Meet James. (cooing) - Oh, he is beautiful. - What brings you here now? - News, good news. - Tell me. - No, I'll wait for Will and I'll say it once. - Are you marrying then? - No. I had my chance at that once and lost it. Come. I traded for some fine cloth for you, Anne. - Oh, thank you. (laughing) - And this is for Sarah. - Oh. (birds chirping) - Is that Matthew? (growling) (laughing) (grunts) This is for you. - Thank you. - Ethan. (sighs) You're months early. - He has news. - Yes, grand news. First some cool water for this throat. (sloshing) - Where you off to, Ethan? - That's the news, Will. I've been hired on for an expedition into the Ohio wilderness, making maps. - When? - I'm on my way now. Year's work. What a journey, new land, new tribes. - Now. - I won't be able to bring your family to you in June. - You change this now. You gave us your word. You break this oath, and you break me. Have you thought of that? You break us all. - You'll have your land. - How? All of our money's in it. If we don't make the claim in the spring, we lose everything. - You'll claim it as you said, you and Matt, you'll build your cabin. - And who will bring Ann and the little ones to us? - [Ethan] You will. You'll fetch em yourself. - And leave the claim unattended. It'll be taken. You know that. - Then you'll find another way. You have a grown son now. - [Will] Matthew? - He's just a boy, Ethan. - No ma, not anymore. - You see, he's got some of his uncle in him. (slaps) (gasps) (baby crying) I won't fight you, Will. (sighs) You talk to him. - Talk to him yourself. You think you have my blessing? - Ma, I could stay on that claim. I could stay alone while pa comes back to fetch you all to Maine. - All alone for six or seven weeks? - Well it's like what I read, like the Robinson Caruso. I could stay alone, do for myself. I know a lot about that. - You don't know how precious you are to me. You don't know that. - (sighs) I'm sorry, Will. If you lose the claim, I'll pay you back when I return. (sighing) (thumps) Be going. - Will. - Keep your hair on. - Do my best. (birds chirping) - You'll make a hole in the ceiling with your eyes. - It all feels like a bad trick. I'm made to be the fool again. - No. - Every turn I've taken to try to improve, make a step. We came here for better and found worse. Put all of our savings into that sawmill only to watch them burn to ashes. Annie, I don't want to be left with ashes again. - The boy is too young, Will. - Oh, I was eight years old and already hard at work. You see this? This curve of wood, 30 years of learning and doing in this curve of wood. You do good work, the work does for you and for your family. That's all I know and I still believe it. Come with me one more time. The settlement will grow around us and we'll have need for all the chairs and tables I have left in these hands. (gentle orchestral music) - You're not asking, will I go with you. I always go with you. You're asking will I put the boy in danger. - It isn't danger. It's loneliness and hard work, yes, but for only six or seven weeks. - He's a town boy as you've said so many times, he's softer than you. - You've done that to him. You've kept him too close to the breast. It's time now, time you let loose of him. (gentle orchestral music) (rooster crowing) - Here, I know you like my sweet preserves. - And this is from me. - I don't need a doll. - It's to remember me by. (sneezes) - Hide it deep, cover it. - I wish I could go. I can swing a hammer. I can hit a nail better than you. - That's true enough. - And I'm not scared of the savages either, pa. - I didn't say I was scared. I'm not. - There's no harm in caution, none. Here, in my own lace so you'll think of your mother. - Be a good boy now, James. - Here, take his cap so you'll forget no one. (birds chirping) - Hurry now, the boat sails Friday for the Maine coast and not again for a fortnight. (baby crying) Come on now, come on. (gentle orchestral music) (hooves clomping) (cheerful orchestral music) (lively chatter) (cheerful orchestral music) (hooves clomping) (cheerful orchestral music) (hooves clomping) (cheerful orchestral music) (thumping) Afternoon. - Afternoon. - Name's Hallowell. Our claim is three days northwest of here. - I heard there's a settler moving out here. Must be 20 more coming next spring. - How far are you building this road? - From the river trail to Pinewell Creek. - Build it wide, I'll be back late summer with wife, children and all our goods. Will this trail take a wagon? - Two wagons wide by the time we're done with it. Who'll be keeping your claim? - Oh it'll be kept, don't you worry. (gentle orchestral music) - Pa! Come see! (cheerful orchestral music) Hiya, hiya, giddee up, giddee up, step up, step up. (horse whinnies) Come on now, hiya, hiya. Hiya, step up. Come on now, hiya, hiya. (horse whinnies) Ha now, ha now, ha ha. Whoa. (swishing) (slow quiet orchestral music) Nevermind, they're curious I suppose. They'll keep their distance, you keep yours. - What if I meet one? - Well people in Buck's Town said not to trust them. They're remembering the wars, I guess. (swishing) (gentle orchestral music) - (sighs) It's really fine, pa. - She'll stand. Come, I want to leave you with plenty of dressed game before I go. - Afraid I can't shoot my own? - I know you can. - [Matthew] I can hit anything with this rifle. - [Will] I'm leaving it with you. - You're leaving the Jaeger? - It's yours until I come back. Hold it so that nothing can take it away and when you're not holding it, keep it where you can reach it and quick. It will keep you safe and it will feed you. Now, take it. (hooves clomping) (crows cawing) One day you'll look down there and see us coming. Coming to our home. - I'll be waiting, crops'll be tall and the cellar built, promise. - Give me your hand. My father's and mine and now yours. (crying) (melancholy orchestral music) (horse whinnies) Wind that watch everyday. - I will. - And make sure that rifle is cleaned and greased. - [Matthew] I will. - Keep the birds off the corn. - Yes sir, I will. - [Will] I'll be back in six weeks for the harvest. - I'll be waiting, pa! (inspirational orchestral music) Pa! (wind blowing) (crows cawing) (gentle orchestral music) (crickets chirping) I'm cast upon a horrible desolate island, void of all hope of recovery, but I am alive and not drowned as all my ship's company was. I am divided from mankind, solitaire, one banished from human society. I'm without any defense or means to resist any violence of man or beast. (wolf howling) (cocks gun) (suspenseful orchestral music) (cheerful orchestral music) (fires gun) (cheerful orchestral music) I'm doing nearly as well as Robinson Caruso. I even keep time like he did, a notch for every day and a stick for every week. (crackling flames) - Come out of the house! Hello son. I'm Ben Loomis and you are standing on my land. You're standing on my land, boy. - It's my family's claim. We bought it. - No one ever paid me for it. (crackling flames) (laughs) I'm just funnin' with you, boy. Where's your pa? - He's hunting, he'll be back. - Hunts late, huh? - Sometimes. - You got a ma? - She's coming in from Springfield, be here soon. - Oh so you got a ma. - Yes, sir. - Good, good, good, good. Yeah, I understand that they'll be coming in by the wagon load. There'll be houses, smoke and fences and cows all through here. You got supper cooking. - Yes, sir, I do. (crackling flames) If you're stopping, I guess I could spare you some. - Well, I might be persuaded to pause for a while in my doings. (grunts) (taps) You got any tobacco? - No sir. - Shame. What is that, rabbit? My, my, my, that's a Jaeger, ain't it? That's a Jaeger. I haven't seen one of those since the war. Gee look at-- - My pa don't want people touching it, if you don't mind. - Oh no, I don't mind, I don't mind. I don't blame him either. (thumps) Indians come calling yet? - No. - The Nobscot's around here, you know. Stubborn son's of Caine. And all the Abenaki's, they won't budge. - They're friendly though. - Friendly? (laughing) I don't think so. This ground here is soaked with blood, boy. We won that land from them fair and square! And they still won't budge! Where'd you say your pa was? - He'll be here. - [Sarah] (laughing) I'm gonna get you. - Sarah, shh. Sarah, play quietly, I just got James to sleep. - Here's your Bible. I thought not to send along with him. - No, he has only the gospel according to Robinson Caruso. (laughing) (sighs) (thumps) - Katie? Honey? Honey? - Sarah, fetch some water. - No, no, I'll take her home. She's warm. She's so warm. Oh. (owls hooting) (fire crackling) - So you say that battle you fought was near here? - Battle? Oh, the big Indian war. Yeah, it was 10 Indians for every one of us, but we stood fast. I stood up on a rock with arrows wooshing by me like birds, oh! I led the attack. (screams) Killed every one of em, Battle of Longhouses. No more rabbit. (door closes) (fire crackling) (owl hooting) - It's all gone. (knocking) - Too dark for me to go back to my camp now. Maybe I'll nestle in here for a while if you don't mind. (owl hooting) (door closes) (fire crackling) (crickets chirping) Your pa sure builds a nice tight cabin. I'll give him that. Even though he does leave his boy all alone. - I'm not alone, he'll be here. - And he's gonna find me asleep. Yeah, I sure hope he don't shoot me with that fine rifle. (laughing) (wolves howling) (fire crackling) - Goodnight. (crickets chirping) (suspenseful orchestral music) (birds chirping) No. (clanks) No! Ben Loomis, you bring it back! (dramatic orchestral music) Loomis! (dramatic orchestral music) Bring it back, Loomis! (grunts) (splashes) (crows cawing) (splashing) (melancholy orchestral music) (crickets chirping) (gentle orchestral music) (horse whinnies) (dog barking) (gentle orchestral music) - Annie? Sarah? (gentle orchestral music) (horse whinnies) Sarah? - [Sarah] Daddy! - Oh thank god. (baby crying) (sighs) They told me a little girl was sick. They said she was dying. - Not yours, Will, it's mine. (baby whining) - They talked about the fever on the road. - Well if it is the fever, they'll be closing the town. (water dripping) (crickets chirping) - Josie, Josie! - Oh no. No. (crying) Oh god, no. No! No, (sobbing) god, no! (baby crying) (sobbing) No, no, not my baby, no! Oh god, no. (sobbing) (crying) - Are you really here? I prayed you'd come in time. We have to go to him, will, before they close us in. - I'll get the wagon. We'll leave tomorrow for him. - Yes. Tell me, is he well? - He's fine, Annie. And the cabin is strong and the land is good. It's good. - Who brought me here? - [Man] Saknis. - No. Gotta get that rifle back. My ankle. I drowned I thought. Who pulled me out? Saknis. - Saknis, I don't know what that means. - Means, my name. - You speak English? I've seen you. You were watching my father and me. - Father go far? - He'll be back. (slurps) Did you see the man that stole my rifle? - Loomis. - Yes. It's all right, I'm okay now. I thank you for all your trouble. You can go. Those are my things! Please don't touch them. That's my Robinson Caruso. Please put that back! - I put book where it was on wall. - Yes. - And I put you where you were in creek? - Ow. All right, you can take it. (grunts) (crackling fire) (thumps) (speaking Native American tongue) (pouring rain) (thunder cracking) (baby crying) - They closed us in! - We'll get out, Abe. I'll take the coast road. - Don't let them see you. Fever's got them scared. - We'll make it. There's a ship out of Boston in a week. That's our ship. - Go on now. You take your family out of this dying place, Annie. You get to that boy. - Hiya. (rattling wagon wheels) (pouring rain) (thunder cracking) Come along now, we can't miss this ship. There won't be another til the spring. - [Sarah] Yes, sir. (baby crying) (birds chirping) (groans) - Annie? - I'm fine, Will. - Now remember, when we get to the harbor, they'll be no talk of Springfield. They will have heard about the fever. We'll say we're Boston people. - Yes. (baby crying) (gentle orchestral music) (clomping hooves) (baby crying) (gentle orchestral music) (clatters) (thumps) - Stand. (speaking Native American tongue) (hammering) (thumps) - Thank you. Do you know where my shoes are? (thumps) They're ruined. Thank you. - Your book could not help me. I cannot read the signs. You tell me. - I was born in 1632 in the city of York. - City, big village. Show sign. - City. - Years before, I made trade with missionary men. I teach em Penobscot, they teach me white man tongue, but not the paper. Was a bad trade. Sit. (thumps) - Well why, why do you care about reading? - You fight me with this. Take. (tears) I fight you with this, who will win? - I will. - No. It is not the knives or the guns that kill Penobscot, who drive us from our lands, it's the paper, the treaty paper that says you can take Penobscot land, not share it, take. - My father bought this land. - From other white men who took it! It is where we live and hunt and fish forever. Now we make new trade. You teach white man signs. - Me, I'm no teacher. - You will teach the paper so my people will not be fooled again. That is the trade. I gave you life, you teach. - I'll try. I'll do my best until my family comes back. - No, not teach me. - Teach who? (walking footsteps) (thumps) (splashes) - My grandson, Attean. (speaking Native American tongue) - How can I teach him if he doesn't even speak English? - I speak. White man's words taste like poison. - You see? He speaks. (speaking Native American tongue) - Start with this word, city. It starts with a c. Can you say that? C? See words are made up of these little bits called letters. - How long? Before I read, how many days? - Days, it'll take months and months to learn. (hooves clomping) - [Will] Morning. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Morning. (baby crying) - On our way to Boston. My wife's taken ill. - Bring her down. - It's the fever, mister. (baby crying) I'm afraid the little boy has it also. (baby crying) - Come on. (baby crying) (crackling flames) (crickets chirping) - My James. - He's doing well, Annie. He sweated out the fever. He's not even warm. - I'm glad you're awake, mama. - Don't be scared, honey. - Here Sarah. Lay him down gently. - Will, listen, please, I'm going to ask you to do something. - Shh, rest now. - Listen to me. You have to do this, Will. You have to go to him. You have to leave us now. - Annie. - The fever will take me or it won't. Your staying won't make the difference. You're his only chance, Will. If you don't go to the ship, he'll die. He'll die of the cold, he'll die of the loneliness. You have to go, please. Give me this, please, go. Go! - All right, all right. All right. - You go. - I'll go, I'll go. (flames crackling) (somber orchestral music) - Only two more weeks. I can sure do two more weeks. Though I'm eating up all the flour. With the rifle gone, I haven't tasted game for too long. I don't know, pa, I've got to stop talking to myself and finish this root cellar. - You teach, he stay. - Thank you. Did you shoot it? There's no hole in this rabbit from a musket ball or an arrow. - White men waste gun powder on rabbits. - Well how then? - First you teach. (speaking Native American tongue) - We'll start right here. I had no weapon. See this? Say it. - I had. - Now read it. - I had. (clatters) (rooster crowing) (chickens clucking) - Good morning. - Feeling better? (thumps) - Have I lost a day? - Anne. You shouldn't be up. - Have I lost a day? - Three days. - Oh lord. Then the ship sails tomorrow? We'll go now. Sarah! - [Will] Anne. - [Anne] I'll get the baby. - I couldn't leave. With you so ill, it wasn't possible. - I would have gone. (gentle orchestral music) (hooves clomping) (gentle orchestral music) - Yah yah yah, yah yah. (bell rings) The Hallowell family, bound for Buck's Town. - We're about to set sail, you're the last. It was on the Gabriel some months back when you shipped out with us with you son. You walked here from Springfield as I recall. - No, no we're a Boston family. - You know there's a fever in Springfield. You know what the law says. - We've not come from Springfield. (baby crying) - Is the boy ill? - No, the boy's been through it. He's weak is all, feel him. - I can see the rash. - Please, he's through with it. We must board this ship. Our son is waiting for us. - I can't do it. It's not allowed. It's the law. (bell rings) (baby crying) - Are any of you traveling on this ship? Are you? Sir, are you traveling on this ship? - Uh yeah. - They won't allow us on board, will you go in our place? - Go where? - Our son is three days out of Buck's Town. Will you go to him, save him before the winter comes? - Please. - Bring him back to the settlement? - There's nothing three days out of Buck's Town. - There's a cabin and a road now. I can tell you how to go. It's three days out and three days back. If you go, you can have our claim of land. I'll sign. - I'm sorry, I (sighs) I'm not a frontiersman, mister. That's hard country. Come on, girls. - But you'll have the land and save a life. - Sorry, mister. - Will you go? - [Man] No, not I. - Anyone? He's but 13 years old and the winter's coming. - [Man] I'm not going there, sorry. (bell rings) - [Man] No. (gulls squawking) - We'll go over land then. - To Maine, how long? - (sighs) Five weeks, maybe more. - [Matthew] I don't see anything. - You don't see anything? All of creation is here, look close, like you're reading words. (crows cawing) Catch small animals and hold it. - I didn't know you could make a trap like this. - Not trap, animal snare. White man make trap with iron and teeth, hunt even little animal with gun, like fools. - I'm not a fool. Why should I teach you at all if you hate me so much? - Then do not teach me. Keep your words and your paper. - You think he can say about this. You cannot say because you know nothing. You know nothing about keeping your people alive, your clan, your tribe. And you, you say we should not hate you. Look at your hands, look at their color. Those are the hands that killed his mother, my daughter. He saw this, he heard the screams. You know nothing about hate, sit down. You also. Closer. Now begin. - Weapon, today we're learning this word, here. Weapon. (crackling fire) (gulls squawking) - How's the boy? - He's not come back to health. He's too young, too weak and so far from home. - Sarah. Let me take him a while. - No, no, I've been through the fever and you haven't. When Katie died, I felt the life go out of her. She was heavier when it left her. How can that be? (somber orchestral music) (baby whining) Keep the life in him, Will. Keep it there. (thumps) (dog barking) (crackling fire) - Dog is good for nothing. We find no meal because he makes noise. - You're supposed to be at my cabin, right? (whines) I bet you tell your grandfather I'm teaching you when you're sitting out here. - Leave dog alone. (speaking Native American tongue) (whining) - Why do you bring him along if you don't like him? Can I go with you? Can I see it, your village? - No. - You've been to my home. I won't tell your grandfather about missing the lessons. - No white people can come to my village. - I won't do any harm. - White people say this. White people lie. - I don't lie. - You say your family comes. - They will! - Your father says he comes back. - I have his word on it. - Summer is over, your father lies. (thumps) (rustling) (grunting) (clanks) (grunting) - Ah, Loomis. His trap. (clanks) I'll take it to my village. He is our enemy. - He's my enemy too. - He is white, you are white, you stay away. (clanking) (dog barking) (shouting) (speaking Native American tongue) (gentle Native American music) (melancholy orchestral music) (birds chirping) - Bless him, lord. He hasn't had a chance to do wrong or do anyone harm. He comes to you clear. - Bless you, little James. Say goodbye, Sarah. Say it, speak to him. Speak to him. (crying) - Leave her. - No. She hasn't spoken all day and she hasn't wept. She keeps it inside as her parents do. You wait. You wait until I'm finished. I'm not finished. I said nothing for too long. - Say it then. - I left my family all behind to come with you to Springfield and try again and I said nothing. I put all of me into it and watched the fire take it all away and I said nothing because I saw it breaking you. I saw you chasing the luck that always got away and it made you hard, Will Hallowell and dark and I said nothing, but now my children are dying. (crying) My little boy is in the ground and one alone in the wild and dying too because I said nothing! I should have screamed what was in my heart. No. When Ethan couldn't guide us, no! When you said Matt could stay alone, no! Now I'm saying it too late. (crying) And I would give my life to change it. Leave me. Leave me with him. (sobbing) - Sarah. (somber orchestral music) (sobbing) (crackling flames) - What are you doing? - Thanking the spirit of the fish for feeding us. - Is that tobacco? Why do you do that? - Shh. - What? ♪ The month of May, the month of May ♪ ♪ And the rose buds were swelling ♪ ♪ Sweet William on his deathbed ♪ - Loomis. ♪ Of Barbara Allen ♪ - There's my rifle. I'm going to get it back. - He will kill you. - Then help me. He's your enemy too. If you go over there and make a sound, he'll look for you and I'll run and grab the rifle. - I sang quietly to myself-- - You run too loud. You make noise over there. - [Loomis] In my diary-- - It's my rifle, my pa put it in my care. Wait! - I saw an insect. I wondered how many insects are in the forest. (rustles) (birds squawking) I heard a twig-- (rustles) (squirrel chattering) (twig cracks) - No! (fires gun) (grunts) (dramatic orchestral music) (grunting) (cracks) (grunts) Come on. (labored breathing) (dramatic orchestral music) (clanks) (screams) (thumps) (screaming) - No! - Help me, boy! Come here. Come here, I was coming after you to, I stepped in one of my own. (crying) - You stole my rifle. - I don't want to die here! - You killed women and children in my village. - Yes, I did a lot of bad things, but I swear I won't do nothing bad no more. If you won't help me, then go get me a rock, a big one, and finish me! Finish me off, I can't take it no more. - If I get you out, you'll never come back? - No, never. - Not to this whole territory? - No, I'll clear out. Clear out, I swear. - [Attean] No, do not let him free! - Oh, thank you, thank you. Oh, thank you. Stand me, stand me up. - You are white, white as he is and a fool! - You go on one side and you put your weight on this side and I'll put my weight on that side. (grunting) (clanks) (labored breathing) - You made an oath. - I know I did. I know I did, son. (gasping) And I will keep it. I will keep it. (labored breathing) (gentle Native American music) (quiet talking) (speaking Native American tongue) - You let our enemy go. - I have his oath. He won't ever be back here again and I give you his trap. (clatters) (speaking Native American tongue) (clatters) - It's not for you to let him go. (speaking Native American tongue) - Leave us. (speaking Native American tongue) - You will stay with us. You will see a boy become a man. You'll stand beside Attean. He spoke for you. (quiet talking) (bird squawking) (quiet Native American music) (crackling fire) (mumbling) - They don't like me too much. - Their village was attacked, Loomis and the other white men. - Battle of the Long Houses, he told me. - Battle, there were four warriors here, many women, children, 20 white men came. They killed my mother. I still see it. (somber Native American music) (speaking Native American tongue) (gentle Native American music) (cheering) - I better go. - Will you find your way? - You taught me, didn't you? (gentle Native American music) (clomping hooves) (rattling wheels) - [Anne] Will? - [Will] The road is not finished. - [Anne] Will. - There's no way for a wagon through here. (birds squawking) We're six days out of Buck's Town. - I won't go back. - I'll take you and Sarah back there. I'll head out on my own. - I won't take one backwards step, Will and cost Matt even one more day. He's pulling us there, he's praying us there. Can't you hear him? - We'll have to leave almost everything. - Then we will. (melancholy orchestral music) (clanks) (birds chirping) - No, keep bent, this part. - Elbow. - Keep elbow bent. (whooshes) (thumps) Good, good. - I worked two days, but you write words I never see before. What is this long word? - Sound it out. (sighs) - Pen, oh, Penobscot. - Now read the list of words as I point to them. - The Penobscot will never sell away their land again. The valley of our hunting will soon be our home and the Penobscot will make our village there forever. (rattles) (speaking Native American tongue) (melancholy orchestral music) - Come on now. (melancholy orchestral music) (clatters) (door opens) - Matu, (door closes) To walk on top of snow. - Thank you. - Learn, deep snow stay long time. - I will. - Learn now, you have far to go. - What do you mean? - You have done well, Matu, but even if you win against the winter and live, it would be a life alone. That is no life. - I won't be alone. - No, you will come with us when we leave. Be with us. - Thank you, Attean, but my family is coming. - No one will come now. - I gave my word. My pa gave his. I can't leave. When are you going? - Soon. First I will go out and have my vision. - Will you come to say goodbye? - I will come. (door closes) (scraping) (wind blowing) - She's bad lame. (wind blowing) You two walk on ahead. - Pa. - She's only going to get worse and when the night comes and the wolves come, she won't even be able to run. - No! - That's the way it is here, Sarah. It's kinder to make it quick for her. (crying) (wind blowing) (fires gun) - [Sarah] No. (speaking Native American tongue) (bird squawking) (whooshes) (speaking Native American tongue) - Matu. - You look, well you're a brave now. - Yes. - Warrior, I guess, can hunt with the men. - My grandfather will speak to you. - We have spoken, the whole village, we would have you with us. You have fought our enemy. You have given us the power of the white man's sign and you have a strong heart that would fight the winter alone, like Attean, you have become a brave. The snow will free you from your promise. Do not stay here alone. - I don't know. - We leave now. - [Saknis] The white man has come so we will leave these lands forever. - I promised. I said I'd be here. I still believe they're coming. (sighing) (speaking Native American tongue) (sighing) - I'm sorry. Attean! Attean. It's so hard to see you go. - Come, Matu. We will find good hunting lands, make good village, live there well. - What if they do come and I'm not here? - You are my brother. (dog whining) (speaking Native American tongue) - I-- (whining) I leave this dog with you. He is no good for hunting. You take him. (birds squawking) - For you. My brother. (speaking Native American tongue) (melancholy Native American music) (dog barking) (whining) (thumps) (clatters) (clatters) (flames crackling) (clatters) (crying) You said seven weeks, pa, seven! What happened? I think every night about it. Did the ship go down? Are you dead? (crying) Nobody would ever tell me. Nobody would ever come, ever! Why won't you come? Please. I prayed for it and still you don't come. Maybe I'm crazy to keep on waiting. (crying) Am I? Should I go? Tell me. Should I go? (sobbing) (melancholy orchestral music) (gentle Native American music) (scratching) (fire crackling) (rattling) First time I let it stop. (thumps) (wind blowing) (crow cawing) - It's no good. It's no good. I've led us wrong. - Then we go back, back to the river? - Yes, but not now. We'll stay here tonight. It'll cost us a day. (exhaling) Cost us more than that. How far back does your sorrow go when you look at me? - What are you saying? - You had a choice, 15 years ago. You thought you chose the safe brother, but look, look at us now. - I chose the steady man, the man who would live by his word. - But you wanted him, you loved him, didn't you? - Here and now you're asking me this? - Here and now. - With our son, alone in a wild place, starving or sick or dying? - Yes, by god, here and now! And if Matt has come to harm, then I'll take the blame and you can have my life for it. I'll end it myself-- - No you won't. You'll carry on for Sarah and for me. (crow cawing) That's why I chose you. I wish you could've turned your back on me a month ago and gone to our son, but you couldn't. It's who you are. It's who I wanted. No other, ever. (crow cawing) (flames crackling) Will. - Sarah, you know what Matt's doing right now? He's looking up at this very same sky. - And he's thinking about his sister. (distant yelling) - Listen. Listen. I swear I heard a voice. - (laughing quietly) Maybe you're hearing Matt's voice as I do. - [Man] Hello the camp! - Will. - [Will] Hello. - [Man] Greetings. - [Will] Welcome. - We thought we was dreaming. (laughing) A settler's camp this far into the wild. And the prettiest girl child I've seen in five seasons. Oh, hello darling. - What brings you to these savage parts? - We're heading for our claim. - Your claim? So they're selling claims in purgatory now? (laughing) - Do you know this country? - I know it won't take to a plow. I know there's not a living soul to give you comfort for miles around. - But do you know the creek? Will. - Pinewell Creek. - We crossed it four days from here and we won't be going back, not into the teeth of winter, no sir. - Maybe one of you would guide us. We have almost nothing left, but we would give you whatever we can. (laughing) - I might be interested. - I'll see what I can find. - Are you crazy? Winter'll catch you out there for certain. - Look at their clothes, dirty from travel, with mud and they're poor. I'm betting they have a bag of coins, some silver. - What are you planning, murder? - No, no need of that, winter'll kill em soon enough. Why should I let them be buried with their valuables? (cocks gun) Oh so that's your gold? - It's lead. Leave us alone, leave our camp. (murmuring comments) - [Man] Eh, let's be gone from here. - Do you want me to help you or not? - Yes. - [Will] Anne. - Because I'm game for it. - Fool's gold, fool's folly. Come along, we're moving out. - I know that strip of land where the claims are. I'm just hoping that our luck holds out against the weather. - We're thankful, we're so thankful. (chuckling) (chipping) (gentle Native American music) (clatters) (gentle Native American music) - Thanking you, the spirit of this pheasant for feeding me, for feeding us. (whining) (wind gusting) (dramatic orchestral music) (tapping) - [Will] Not easy to start a fire with this wet wood. - [Loomis] I'll get some pitch pipe. - Hurry please, she's freezing. (dramatic orchestral music) (tapping) (grunting) (clattering) - Maybe he's left us. I don't know why he came at all, we have nothing to pay him. - There's a few coins sewn into my dress. - Not enough for risking your life. He's in as much danger as we are. - Then we'll give him everything we own, everything in the cabin too. - Nothing of value there, only the Jaeger rifle. - What's this about a Jaeger rifle? (wind gusting) - I left it with our son at the claim. - Please, our son Matt is only 13. He's been there all alone, months. (wind gusting) (clicking) (flames roar) (crackle) - [Loomis] Fine weapons, those Jaegers. - If you get us to that claim, you can have it. - No. (crackling flames) (gentle orchestral music) (gusting wind) (crackling fire) (clanks) (gusting wind) - I guess that's the end of it then. I guess you're never coming. (door closes) (dramatic orchestral music) (dog barking) What's the matter with you? (dog barking) No, I can't take you hunting, you'll scare the game. (whining) (barking) No wait, you come back here! (door closes) (labored breathing) Myigan! Myigan! (barking) - [Anne] (labored breathing) Will, I can't carry her anymore. - [Will] We have to stop and build a fire. - [Loomis] No, it's too cold, keep moving, keep moving. - Listen. (dog barking) - What honey? - Hear it? (dog barking) - Will, look. - [Will] What? - [Anne] See on the hill. - I'll be damned. (serene orchestral music) - [Sarah] Matthew? - [Anne] Matt! (inspirational orchestral music) - [Sarah] Matt! - Matt! Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh! (crying) Oh. - [Will] Oh thank god. Thank god. - Where's James? - We'll tell all. Is the fire going? Let's get Sarah to it and our guide. - Loomis! - You know him? He saved us, he brought us here. - Come on, the cabin's warm. (laughing) There's a little pheasant left and some broth and cornmeal cakes. - [Will] I've dreamed this moment, Matt, dreamed it 100 times. - Will. Matt? He's gone, Matt, your brother's gone. - It was the fever delayed us and it took our James. - (sighs) Oh Matt, you've done so well here, better than I ever dared dream. - [Will] I can't tell you how proud I am. - I had help, pa. - [Will] Who, Loomis? - The Indians, Saknis, Attean. - Well I'd like to thank them. - They're gone, as gone as James is, but they taught me. - Well maybe when we have time and we've settled in, you can start to teach me. (laughing) (crying) (inspirational orchestral music) (cheerful orchestral music)
