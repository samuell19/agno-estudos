(Birds whistling) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) Happy Show day! i'm gonna get you. (Music) Can I help you? Yeah, sure. Can you fill this? (Music) (Music) Thank you. Whew! Ah, yi, yi. Oh my God. (Laughs) What happened? I think the waffle iron just broke. What happened? The waffle iron. Oh my God. Ok. So, it's still cooking. So, we're OK. Alright. It's still cooking. Theodore is getting into it. What did you do? I don't know. This is supposed to be part of the movie where it's like we're really cool gays dads and we make waffles. Listen, we are cool gay dads. Should we turn it off now? (Laughs) That would be a good idea. Did you spray any non-stick stuff? No, i'm nervous. I can't think about this. Alright. We're not going to use any of this for the show. (Laughs). I think my brain is on the show. This is still a waffle. That's what the cooking spray is for. I know. I don't know what he did here. Wow. Child Protection Services will come after us when they see (Laughs) this. Hey, look, look. I was able to save it. That's brilliant. How did you do that? Alright. Go, go sit there please. You have other skills. Awww. Mmm. I'll make you some apple juice. They taste really good. Thank you. Are you dressed? Do you want me to put this in the car? Oh, sure. (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) Are you excited? Yay. I know I'm excited. I just have to pee really, really bad. I know. Me too. Should I try some makeup or should I go au natural? Air brush only? No, no. I want everything done. I want, I want a peel. I want lip. I got you. I want you to take care of this Janet Reno waddle. (Laughs) This is how Asian people deteriorate. You are all pretty and everything and then right before 50. There is some kind of elastic band in back of your head that just breaks. And everything starts to fall. Sure (Laughs). It's true. (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) Should we have, should we bond a little? Hi, where are you going? And off he goes again. He's like Ms. Pacman right now eating the entire crab service table. Yeah. I'm sure he's like I just don't want him to puke on stage. That would be so embarrassing. He's not going to puke on stage. Alright. The human reveal. I'll see you on stage. Look great. Alright. I love you daddy. Bye. Thanks baby. Alright time for you to leave. Really loud. That's good. Ok Zion, we're going to play out here during the show. (Music) You go this way right? No, no, no. This way? I'm never going to get back. Whoooo! Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, America's Asian sweetheart Alec Mapa! (applause) (applause) Hello, Los Angeles! I made it! Welcome to the show! Ohhh. We are filming live tonight in California, the golden state of marriage equality! (Applause) Whooo! I have no doubt in my mind that gay marriage will be the law of the land. oooh! And you know what that means, generations from now, they'll be gay grandpas sitting around the Thanksgiving Day table telling their grandkids "you know, what. I met your grandfather ungrinded (Laughs) He was 30 feet away and he was so handsome and so charming and then he fucked me in the bathroom of the Renberg Theatre at the Alec Mapa show." (applause) (applause) Grandpa that's revolting. Don't tell us that story ever again! (Laughs) Thank you so much for supporting live theatre. (applause) owww! I I love, I love, love, live theatre or as the Filipinos call it live the atre. Um, I fell in love with live theatre while watching television. The year 1977. The place San Francisco. I was watching the Tony Awards with my parents. Because watching the Tony Awards with your parents means never having to say you gay. (Laughter) Now the big show that year was Annie, right? But this is back in the jurassic era, right? There's no internet. There's no shit about musical theatre, right? I don't know who Andrea McArdle is. I don't know who Dorothy Loudon is but all of that changes, right? When the full original cast of Annie comes on and proceeds to do a medley of three musical numbers from the show including Tomorrow, You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile and Easy Street. (Laughs). So Andrea McArdle comes out on stage, all you know, chipmonk cheek with her 70's red feathered bob and she starts to sing Tomorrow and I'm frozen in front of the television, right? Like I'm encased in a block of ice. (Laughter). And then the orphans come out and sing You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile and I can't move. I'm like must stay strong and then Dorothy Loudon (Laughter) the original Ms. Hannigan comes out and sings Easy Street. Jesus take the wheel. Now if you've never seen this performance before do yourself a favor. When you get home watch it on YouTube. She pretty much sings, dances and acts as if her very life depended on it. It was like right before she went on stage there was somebody standing next to her with a gun saying "Look Loudon. This is your very last chance. You go on that stage, bring the house down and nail this number. Cause if you don't when you come back here, I'm going to shoot you in the fucking head. " (Laughter) So Dorothy Loudon goes out on stage. Sings Easy Street. Brings the house down and moments later, she wins a Tony Award and I have a complete nervous breakdown. (Laughter) I start shaking and crying. Shaking and crying like I'm Kate Winslet and I've just been fished out of the icy waters of Nova Scotia and my parents were like " What the fuck is your problem? Why are you crying? Who's the crazy old white lady? Do we know her?" (Laughter) Is she a teacher from school? (Laughter) And looking back, I knew why I was having an emotional reaction. I had just witnessed a resurrection. Even back then I knew that Dorothy Loudon was somebody who had faced oblivion. I knew she was someone who had stared death in the face and thought my career is over. It's too late. I'm too old. There isn't enough magic in the world to sustain my dreams. I don't have a single chance left. No chance left but this one. (Laughter) (applause) And that's why I love live theatre. Because there's always that possibility of redemption right? That you're going to see some performer give a performance like they don't have a single chance left. No chance left - But this one, right? Tonight's not going to be one of those performances...just to (Laughter) Lower your expectations right now. (Laughter). Now I've been too busy folding laundry. I have no act. I called the show Babby Daddy because I'm Fucking Exhausted was too much of a buzz kill. (Laughter) So, I'm a new father. My husband and I adopted a kid. (applause) Listen, thank you. (applause) (Laughs). I'm not gonna sugar coat it for you. Ok? ah, ah, ah. Having children is not for everyone. Alright? It's really easy to ooey gooey and romantic about the idea of children especially when they're not yours, right? And that's where people get into trouble. Right? Do you know what being a parent does to you? It turns you into that tree in that children's book. (Laughter). Do you know which book I'm talking about? Shout it out! The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein. Everybody has a real boner for that book but it's a real fucked up story when you think about it. (Laughter) (applause) Once upon a time there was this tree and a little boy and they love, love, love each other very much and every day they would play together in the woods and he would carve his initials into her trunk and climb her and eat her fruit. Yeah, it's a real fucked up story. (Laughter). And one day the little boy runs up to the tree and says, "I need a place to live and things to sell." So what does he do? He chops off all her branches, takes all her fruit and leaves. Comes back years later and goes "I want to see the world." So, what does he do? He chops down her trunk, runs away and leaves. So now she's nothing but a stump. Right? Right? The little boy comes back years later only he's not a little boy anymore. No. He's a tired broken down old man. (Laughter). And what does he say? Does he say sorry for the vandalism? (Laughter). (Laughter). Does he say thank you? No. What does he do? (Audience: He sits on her). He sits on her! (Laughter). Being a parent is like living through that book every single day. (Laughter - applause). (applause). Children take and take and take and exhaust deplete you of every single resource and just when you have nothing left to give, they fucking sit on you! (Laughter). (Laughter) I'm so lucky. This is terrific. I feel as it we've established a connection of some time. I feel connected to each and every one of you. I really do. Hey! Just for fun. Let's each and every one of us share our most painful childhood memory. (Laughter). No? Ok. Let's talk about my sex life. (Whew!) Alright my husband have been together for 12 years. Right? But we're at the point in our relationship where we have to switch things up in order to keep things interesting and lately that's meant a whole lot of blow jobs in cars. (Laughter). Alright, let me explain. My husband was raised Church of Christ, very fundamentalist Christian. So he gets off on any kind of scenario where he can caught and feel ashamed. (Laughter). I was raised Catholic. I don't really need any help in the shame department. I'm ashamed when I get up in the morning. (Laughter). I'm ashamed right now. I'm ashamed to be telling this story but I'm going to anyway. So, it's date night, we're out driving around Silver Lake and all of sudden my husband goes, "Let's fuck in the car." And I'm like, "I don't want to fuck in the car." Getting fucked is complicated enough, ok? When you add a steering column and cup holder to it, it's like trying to eat a baguette on a tilt-a-whirl, ok? There's too much going on! But marriage is about compromise, right? So I was like, "Ok, I'll blow you." So, I'm not a prude. I'm not afraid of getting caught as long as I don't fat. (Laughter). Right? Like, if you told me that TMZ had a picture of me blowing somebody in a car, my first question would be is do I look fat? Because, you know, the camera already adds 10 pounds, this doesn't help. So, I'm blowing my husband in the parking lot of a Bank of America in Silver Lake but I'm really paranoid, so I'm looking around, right? So, I'm like oo oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo. I look like a barn owl choking on a titmouse, right? oo, oo, oo. All of sudden the phone starts ringing, right? And he's like, "Don't answer, I'm really close!" And I'm like, "I have to. It's the babysitter." So, I'm like, "hello?" "Yeah, no. Zion is not allowed to have cake and ice cream right before bed. He's said that? Put him on the phone. Zion it's daddy. You are not allowed to have cake and ice cream right before bed. We discussed this. You got to bed right now. You're gonna be in big, big trouble. Do you understand me?" "No, I don't want to talk to the dog. I love you too. Good night." (applause) Let's just say you won't be seeing that on an episode of Modern Family any time soon. (Laughter). (Laughter) My husband and I always wanted children. Always. But it was something we thought we would get around to eventually. Right? Like going to Tabet. (Laughter). Or Machu Picchu. Or Colonial Williamsburg, you know. (Laughter). Eventually. And then I turned 43 and a bell went off. Bing! I had a complete classic mid life crisis. I stopped eating, hired a trainer and I lost 30 lbs. Oh, don't applaud. It was horrible. I was like a couple of pounds above organ failure. (Laughter). I looked fabulous. Every morning it was struggle to lift my head up off the pillow. But I looked 10 years younger and that's all that mattered. And then I had to go night clubbing every single night with boys in their 20's cause I couldn't afford a sports car. (Laughter) And here's the thing about gay boys in their 20's. God love them. They're cute, adorable and fun. But most of them are really, really dumb. (Laughter) Like they're even dumber than I was. I had a gay boy in his 20's in my audience say, "Who's Betty Davis?" (Laughter). And I was like you know what? Google it. Press a button. Make a fucking effort. I'm not here to put you through gay school. Right? Alright, here's the thing. I love my friends in their 20's and I'm not here to put anybody down. So in order to bridge the gap between our two generations, I'd like to do my impression of Betty Davis singing a Miley Cyrus song as karaoke. (Applause) Ready? Hit it! (Music) (Music) (Music) * Hopped off the plane at LAX * with a dream and my cardigan * Welcome to the land of fame excess, am I going to fit in?* (Audience clapping) * Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time * * Looked to my left and I see the Hollywood sign * * This is all so crazy, Everybody seems * * so famous. My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' * * kind of home sick, too much pressure and I'm nervous * * That's when the taxi man turned on the radio * * And a Jay-Z song was on, And a Jay-Z song was on* * And the Jay-Z song was on, and the Jay-Z song * * was on (Applause) (Applause) Should I continue? Alright. * They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away * * Nodding my head, like yeah * Moving my hips life yeah * I got my hands up, they're playing my song, I know I'm going * * to be ok. Yes * There's a party in the USA. (Applause). * Yes *There's a party in the USA (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Laughs). So, I partied really hard with boys half my age for a year and my husband was like "What's wrong with you? Do you want to leave me?" And I was like, "I don't want to leave anybody. I'm just scared. I'm in the middle." "I'm too young to be old. I'm too old to be young and I just thought if I hung out with a bunch of young pretty boys who were young and fuckable, that would make me feel young and fuckable too. And my husband said, "I still think you're fuckable. I'll fuck you." (Applause). "Get in the car." (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) So we did it! We adopted a 5 year old African American boy from Compton. (Yayyy! Applause) (Laughs). His name is Zion. I'm Asian, my husband's white. Our son is black. We look like the last two minutes from It's A Small World. (Laughter) And people are always asking, "Where's he from?" Is he from Botswana? (Laughter). Is he from Rwanda? Is he from Malawi? And I'm like, "No". He's from Compton." As a celebrity I feel it's my duty to inform people that you don't have to go all the way to Africa to adopt a black child. (Applause) (Applause) You can get one right here in the United States. So, one time Zion had a melt down at a Barnes & Noble bookstore, right? And I was surrounded by people who did not have children and they all gave me that stink eye, you know, like "Will you please keep your adopted African American child quiet?" You know. And I was so angry, I stared them all back and I went, "He's from Haiti." (Laughter) (Applause). Shame on all of you. (Applause) Now, to be honest, I had no business taking a 5 year old I just adopted to the Barnes & Noble. But the Patti Lupone memoir had just come out. (Laughter) It was an emergency. (Laughter) The first month was hell. He would have one huge melt down after an another. And by melt down I mean he would fall to the ground kicking and screaming at the top of his lungs, right? And it was always in a public place. So my husband and I had to physically restrain him and carry him back to the car. So we basically looked like two gays guys who were kidnapping Arnold (Laughter) on a very episode of Different Strokes. (Applause). And I was like thank God we drive a Volvo station wagon. Cause if we drove a white van, we'd be in jail. Now, looking back maybe we shouldn't have been driving him all over town the first month he came to live with us. But the way I looked at it, he'd been in one shitty foster home after another since he was 3. Right? So it was time for him to see the world. So I took him to the planetarium, The Museum of Natural History, Bloomingdales, you know. Places a kid should know about. And the melt downs were understandable, right? One minute he was living in the hood. The next minute he was living with us. So, it was like, who are you? Where am I? What's gazpacho? (Laughter) Now I have a high tolerance for crazy. Ok? But that melt down in the book store was the last straw. (Laughter). Driving him home that night I was screaming at him in the rear view mirror. I was like, "You know what?" "Babies kick and scream because they can't talk. You can talk. If you're angry or sad, you can tell me. If you're frustrated or frightened, you can tell me. But kicking and screaming while daddy is trying to buy a book by Patti Lupone is completely unacceptable." (Laughter) And he was like, "Ok", and the melt down stopped. And then he started pre-school and the melt downs started again. Whenever I dropped him off he'd say, "You're not coming back." Because that had been his experience, you know. People would just drop him off and never come back again. So I was like, "What are you talking about? I love you. I'm crazy about you. I will always come back." "You know what, when school lets out, I'm going to be standing right here. I won't even move. I will always come back." I said that every single day. So by the end of the school year he was like, "I know! You're coming back!" (Laughter). The other thing he used to say when he first came to live with us is "Where am I gonna go next?" And I was like "Where do you want to go next?" And he goes, "with you guys." And I'm like, "Well you're not going anywhere. You live here. You're home now. You live here." "Now eat your quinoa." (Laughter). So my husband wanted a 5 year old and this how is he sold me on it. This was his pitch. He comes to live with us. He walks. He talks. He goes to school. No diapers. How hard could it be? Hahaha! (Laughter) My husband and I are a couple of dummies. Ok? Cause what we feel to realize is that shitting their pants is what 5 year old boys do best. (Laughter). It is their area of expertise. It's their speciality de la maison. Which is French for "Hey, I just shit my pants!" (Laughter). Five year old boys notoriously ignore the impulse to go potty until it's too late. I was always like, "Baby this isn't like Christmas shopping or doing your taxes. You can't wait until the last minute. You have to go when you feel like going. " Now we adopted our son out of foster care and apparently in all of his placements nobody had ever taught him how to pee in the potty, wipe his booty, flush the toilet or wash his hands. I had to teach him those things by saying it over and over and over again. I was like a statulogical parent. Pee in the potty, wipe your booty, flush the toilet, wash your hands. Errrr! The very first time I changed my son's underwear it looked like a crime scene. (Laughter). All that was missing was that police tape and that Law and Order segue music, you know, Dong! Dong! (Laughter). He would pee like he was putting out a forest fire. Right? Just a slow and steady stream right at the base. The base meaning the wall, the magazines. The really expensive bubble bath that gay men have right before they have children. Right? We used to have a really nice bathroom, right? It was a gay guys bathroom. It was like a spa at the Four Seasons. Now it's like a port-a-potty at Mardi Gras. (Laughter). Not flushing the toilet was the absolute worst. Every morning walking into that bathroom was like taking a rorschach test. It was like Oh, that one looks like a snake. Oh, well that one looks like a snake buying a bottle of wine at Trader Joes. (Laughter). Oh, that one looks like a snake eating another snake. Flush the fucking toilet! (Laughter) And he was the worst liar. He came back to the dinner table one time and I was like, "Did you flush the potty?" He said, "Yes." I said, "Can I check?" He said, "Don't." (Laughter). Alright he's the thing. Zion eats really healthy food because when he came to live with us out of foster care, his health was garbage. Right? He had this cough that we thought was a cold or allergies. He turns out he had viral pneumonia. So we put him on all this organic food. Really expensive. But he rallied. My husband's parents are small town folk. They're not really into health food and we were spending Thanksgiving with them and right before Thanksgiving my husband and I got into this huge fight because he was like, "Mmmmm I just don't want them to give him too many treats." "Mmmmm." And I was like, "You know what? I don't want to be that gay, hippy, crunchy couple that ruins every single holiday with all of their food restrictions." Do you know who I'm talking about? Oh, we only feed our kid vegan treats made out of spelt and hemp milk, ohhhh. I don't want to be that couple. It's Thanksgiving. Let him have whatever he wants. So we show up at Thanksgiving. My son starts eating like he's going to the electric chair, right? (Laughter). He eats an entire gingerbread house, a pumpkin pie, a gallon of ambrosia, a green bean casserole, an entire non-vegan ham, right? And after dinner he goes to the fireplace with grandma and grandpa to make s'mores, cause I think he still had room in his esophagus. (Laughter). And that's when he turns to my husband, he goes, "Papa, I don't feel so good. I'm gonna be sick." So my husband scoops him up. They run to the bathroom. They don't make it. My son barfs all over the kitchen floor. ewwwahhhhh. So like, I got this. I'm in the zone. Go take care of this. So I'm on all fours cleaning up the mess in Dior. (Laughter). And I can see my husband in the open door way of the bathroom and my son is barfing into the toilet. Ewwaaahh. Ewwwahhh. And just when it couldn't get any worse, he starts having explosive diarrhea at the same time. Ewwaahhh. Double dragon! Ewaaah! I'd heard of the phenomenon but I'd never actually seen it in person. Ewwaahh! And I look at my husband and he's covered in barf and shit and he's looking at me with just murder in his eyes. Like. (Laughter) And I was like, "Aren't you glad we didn't adopt a baby?" Ahhhh! (Applause) Oh my God. That was three years ago. My son is perfectly fine now. And after 3 years of living with two gay guys, he sounds like he's been living with two gay guys. (Laughter). We were flying back from New York recently and he had the flight attendant for a Pellegrino (Laughter) with lime. (Laughter). He was on a play date at a friend's house and the mom said, "Baby do you want something to eat?" He said, "Yes." She said, "What would you like?" He said, "I would like an assortment of breads with balsamic vinegar and olive oil please." (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) This is the absolute worst. So, we're at the supermarket and he's running up and down the aisle misbehaving and I hate kids who misbehave in the supermarket, right? There's nothing worse. So he's like bumping into people and knocking shit over and I grab him and I said "Listen to me!" "This is not a playground. This is Whole Foods." (Laughter). You nearly knocked down that tower of Kombucha. (Laughter). "Settle down. Be considerate. You are not the only person here." And do you know what he said to me? "And the Oscar goes to...." (Laughter) (Applause) Waaaaaaaaa! (Applause) I didn't know whether to slap him or hug him. I was so proud and so angry at the same time! (Laughter) (Laughter) I've become Faye Dunaway in Mommy Dearest. I am! I'm shouting all the time, which, I mean, it was like shouting at me. He was like, I was on the phone with my agent, one of the few times my agent actually called me. And I, he was like, "Daddy!" My son's the only person in Los Angeles who can call me daddy without giggling. (Laughter). "Daddy!" "I'm on the phone. I will be right with you as soon as I hang up." "But Daddy!" "I am on the phone." And then he shouts at me, "Stop talking you great big fat woman!" (Laughter) (Laughter) "Did you just call me fat?" (Laughter) "Go to your rooooommm!!" (Applause) "Why can't you give me the respect that I'm entitled to!" (Applause) He's done everything but say, because I am not one of your fans. But he's going to. I'm waiting for it. I've re-read Mommy Dearest recently, with completely different eyes. (Laughter) Christina Crawford is an ungrateful, disloyal, spoiled little twat. Just 50 pages in that book devoted to how pissed off she was because she had to write thank you notes. What's wrong with writing thank you notes? My son writes a thank you note for every single gift he receives. Not an email or an e-greeting but an actual thank you note on a thank you note card. Why? Because it's the right thing to do. (Applause). Knock down that bitch of an e-greeting and put a thank you note where a thank you note ought to be. (Laughter) My parenting style at any one given moment can be described by four characters from the amercian musical comedy Fraulein Maria, Auntie Mame, Miss Hannigan or Mamma Rose. When I get up in the morning I'm totally Fraulein Maria, right? I'm peppy. I'm optimistic. I wanna make play clothes out of the curtains. I want to have sex with Christopher Plummer. But by 10:00 a.m., after he's been up since 6:00 a.m., and he's poured maple syrup on the dog and we're out of coffee, I turn into Miss Hannigan and sometimes you get Miss Hannigan all day long. Look, I love Julie Andrews but she set the bar too fucking high. Nobody can be Fraulein Maria 24/7. Ok? Have you ever seen pictures of the real Maria Von Trapp. She didn't look like Julie Andrews. She was a battle axe. She didn't even have a neck. She looked like Brian a neck. She looked like Brian Dennehy in The Bull and you know she beat those kids. How else are you gonna make them sing? I bet she was more Joe Jackson than Julie Andrews. Right? (Laughter). I bet she sounded just like Lawrence Fishburn in What's Love Got to Do With It. You trying to help Ike. (Laughter). You trying to help Fraulein Maria. Now, when we entertain at the house, I'm totally anti Mame, right? Because all of our friends are circus people, right? It's all burlesque performers and drag queens and (Laughs) it's circus people. My son's favorite babysitter, Shangela, from Ru-Paul's Drag Race. (Laughter). Now at baseball games I'm totally Mama Rose, right? I'm like, I wanna know why that no talent klutz gets to play first base every single game while my son who has more talent than all of you put together is playing shortstop. (Laughter). Ok, here's the thing, I don't give a shit about baseball, ok? But my son really wanted to play and I didn't want him to miss out just cause I'm a big sissy. So I took him to try outs. Oh, I'm learning so much. There not auditions there try outs. (Laughter). There not costumes there. (Uniforms) And it's not rehearsal, it's (Practice). Whatever. (Laughter). So we show up for try outs and all the kids are in full baseball drag already, right? They've got the cleats, they've got the helmet, they got a mitt (Laughter) and my son's like in a Hello Kitty tank top shirt, shorts and flip flops, right? (Laughter). And all of the kids are playing catch with their dad like they've been doing this since their kid could walk, right? And I'm like, "I don't know how to do this. I'm not a lesbian, right?" So, (Laughs), the coach comes up to me. He goes "Does he have a glove?" And I'm like, "What length? What are you talking about?" (Laughter) So, my son sees a friend of his from school playing with his dad and they wave them over and he starts playing catch with them. Right? So, already I'm on this huge gay shame spiral, right? Like bad gay dad, bad gay dad. I haven't been doing any of these things with him and now because of me my son's going to totally fuck up with audition and not get a call back, right? (Laughter) (Laughter). So this is what they had to do for the try out. They had to catch the ball. Throw it to first base and hit the ball off the T. Right? And by the way most of the dads at the try outs are total douche bags. Right? Like they're yelling at their kids, "Concentrate. Eyes front. What are you doing?" Now I could understand if this were a ballet class. (Laughter). (Laughter) It's baseball. So, it's my son's turn to try out and by this time everybody knows that he's with me, right? So, they're not expecting much. So I pull him aside and say, "Listen to me. I don't care if you hit the ball. I don't care if you throw the ball. I don't care if you can catch the ball. All that matters to Papa and Daddy is that you're a good sport and you have fun. We will love you no matter what. Now go." So what does he do? He catches the grounder immediately. He throws the ball so far past first base that it hits the back fence and he hits the ball so far to the outfield that nobody can catch it. (Whooo!) (Applause) And all the other dads are looking at me like "what the fuck, what, what?" and I'm like, "I don't know. " (Laughter) But inside I was like (Laughter) (Applause) (Laughter) We wanted to adopt out of foster care. I found out about the foster care adoption system after working on a Rosie O'Donnell cruise. Cause that's how they get ya. (Laughter) Ok? All my friends before going on that R Family cruise were like "ooo girl, don't go on that cruise." "You go on that cruise with the lesbians and their kids they're going to brainwash you girl. You're going to come back with a baby." And I'm like, "what? Are they going to give them out at the gift shop?" (Laughter). It's so stupid. But that's exactly what happened. My husband and I got off that ship and we could not stop thinking about having a baby. We attended every single foster adopt seminar on that ship. We attended hair care for your African American child. (Laughter) That was the day when all the lesbians on the ship had cornrows. (Laughter) It looked like Stevie Wonder had fucked Melissa Etheridge. You know, like, (Laughter) We attended how to adopt through the foster care system. Now here's some interesting statistics. At any one given time there are 500,000 kids in the foster care system. 100,000 of those kids are not going to be reunited with their parents so those kids are up for adoption. The most desirable placement is a caucasian baby girl. Now look, I have nothing against little white girls. (Laughter). I've been one my whole life. (Laughter). (Applause). (Laughter). But if my husband and I are going to start a family, there can only be one lady of the house and you're looking at her. (Laughter). There's only one lady that comes out of Alec Mapa house and that's Alec Mapa and that's me, baby, remember! (Laughter). (Applause) Nobody wants a boy. Nobody wants them over the age of 3 and if they're African American, yikes. A caucasian baby girl is 7 times more likely to be adopted than an African American boy over the age of 3. When my husband and I heard that we were like, "Oh my God. Our son is black. (Laughs) Not our son should be black. Or our son is going to be black but our son is black. He's already out there. He exists. We knew it in our bones and we knew that if we didn't do everything in our power to go out, find him and start our lives together it would be the biggest regret of our lives. Lesbian the brainwash. We met immediately to the Southern California Foster Family Adoption Agency. SCFFAA. To become a foster adopt parent in California, you have to pass a 6 week parenting course. Your home has to pass a safety inspection . You have to be certified in CPR and first aid and you have to pass a background check with the FBI. If your a teenaged girl in California and you want a baby, all you need is sperm. And not only can you have a baby, you can get your own reality show. (Laughter). If you're a couple of gay guys, they go through drawers. They want tax forms for the past 5 years. The FBI background check, that's what freaked me out the most. Right? Cause they fingerprint you like 5 different times and they cross reference, cross cross reference that info with their data base and that's where they could really dig up the dirt on you, right? I was up all night thinking "Was I arrested?" (Laughter) "Was I in jail?" I knew I deserved to be at one point. We showed up for classes. Half the class was gay and lesbian. Right? All the gay guys took up the entire front row. Notebooks open. Pencils at the ready. They were like Hermione Grangera at the Hogwarts, rights? It's like "I know the answer Professor Dumbledore!" When God in liviosa, When God in liviosa. All the lesbians sat in the back row. They were like the bad asses of the class, right? Cause a lot of them had their own biological children and they were there to find out how to adopt siblings for their kids. So they were like, "parenting class. I don't need to listen to this shit. I've got a vagina." And all the gay guys were like, "Um girls, if you didn't want to learn about magic, maybe you shouldn't have enrolled in Hogwarts." (Laughter). So we had a whole class on the safety inspection and we were told that if we were bringing a baby home, there couldn't be any fountains on the property. And all the gay guys were like "oooh!" (Laughter) ooooo. So we passed the course. We were certified to become foster adopt parents. And 9 months after we started the whole process, our social worker told us about a little boy named Zion. He is 4 1/2 years old and he'd been in foster care since he was 3 because of neglect. Nnnn...neglect. See neglect is one of the worst of the things you subject a child to because they can become catatonic. You know it's like if you cry and cry and nobody comes to take care of you, you just stop crying. And sometimes if they're moved from place to place and they suffer one loss after another, you can lose the ability to attach. It's like you can adopt them, but they can't adopt you. It's like, why should I get close to you, you're just going to break up with me anyway. Right? So we were like "neglect. Uh...I don't know. " And our social worker's like "No, no, no, no, no. This child is different. He is affectionate and creative and as far as expressing himself, he has no problem whatsoever." (Laughter). We always know when he's in the office. He has a very distinctive voice and it carries." So, we're like, "When can we see a picture?" and the social worker was like, "When you stop asking questions." So we stopped asking questions and she showed us a picture and we were like, "Ah! That's our baby. That's our kid. When can we meet him?" And she said "this week"? And I like, "Oh my God, it's Thanksgiving. Ok, we have to go home. We have to get him a bed and we have to tell your parents that we're taking their black grandson home for Thanksgiving." (Laughter). We got a call the very next day from the social worker telling us that we were out of the picture. Another family member had come forward and said they would be Zion's legal guardian. Now this is somebody who had never expressed any interest before and had a signficant criminal record but it's what the court ordered so we had absolutely no say. We were crushed. Right? So, Christmas and Thanksgiving sucked because we felt we had missed out on somebody really special. We don't know how but we just felt in our bones that we missed out on somebody amazing. So much that when we were offered another case in January we told our social worker "You know what? We don't want to go further with that case because we don't feel in our bones what we felt about Zion." And the social worker said, "You know what? Let me find out what Zion's situation is and I'll call you back in 10 minutes." She called us back in 10 minutes and said, "The placement with Zion's relative has been a complete disaster. You have to pick him up tonight at 6." So we were like, "Oh my God! Did we really mean all those things that we said? Ohhhhh." (Laughter). So we white knuckled it all the way down to the offices in Long Beach like "aaahhhhh!" And we showed up at the offices where Child Protection Service is and Zion was already waiting for us in the waiting room. This tiny little boy and he was sitting between two garbage bags. One had all of his clothes and one had all of his toys. And he was just sitting in the middle of them like he was just another bag of stuff that somebody had forgotten and didn't want. And I thought, "This isn't fair." Right, like no kid should ever be made to feel this way. And this wasn't a 5 year old, this was a baby right? Cause when you're 5 years old you still need your mommy. Right? You still need your daddy or mommies or two gay guys with a really cute house, right? (Laughter). so I was like, "Hi. I'm Alec. This is Jamie." And he said, "Do you want to play Don't Break the Ice?" (Laughter) Do you remember Don't Break the Ice that game where you tapped on the little plastic ice cubes and sent the ice skating polar bear plunging to his death, right? (Laughter) Well, that's what we did. We broke the ice by playing Don't Break the Ice. And every time that polar bear plunged to its death, my husband and I felt exactly the same way like, "Oh, my God! This is really happening and they're really going to give us this kid!" And after about an hour of playing Don't Break the Ice, I said, "Are you hungry?" And he said, "Yes." I said, "Well, let's go." So we all piled into the car and I asked him, "What do you want to eat?" And he said, "Chuckee Cheese." (Laughter). (Laughter) And in that moment I became a parent. (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) We are not spending our first night together as a family at Chuckee Cheese. So we brought him home, 9 months later we legally adopted him and became Zion Joseph Abare Mapa. (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) Now that was three years ago. My husband makes documentaries and I'm in vaudeville. So we've taken Zion with us everywhere. He's gone to London, Paris, Barcelona, Ixtapa, San Diego, (Laughter) and everybody always says, "He's so lucky." And I know they mean well but I always feel like it's kind of insulting to him, because the truth is we're lucky. There's nothing I could give my son or any place I could take him that could compare to all the things he's that he's given me. Right? Being a parent requires so much patience, compassion and understanding and I don't possess any of those qualities. (Laughter). So being a parent is literally my last chance to become a good person. Right? I don't have a single chance left. No chance left but this one! (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) So, a couple of years ago we got to go on another R Family Vacation and, uh, instead of a cruise they rented out an entire club med right? So it was a great opportunity for my husband and I to reconnect with the other gay and lesbian parents and say thank you. You did this to us. (Laughter) So Club Med's great cause the kids have camp all day long, so all the parents would just hang out by the pool and get completely wasted, right. Just think Bloody Marys all day and then we'd pick up our kids like, ahhhhhh. (Laughter) So my husband and I are having dinner with this family from New Jersey in the dining room and you know how a dining room is. It's noisy, noisy, noisy and all of a sudden there's that window of silence. Well my son uses that window of silence to yell at me from across the dinner table, "Are you drunk?" (Laughter) (Laughter) And I was like "you know what? It's not nice to yell at Daddy at the dinner table like that. I'm very drunk." (Laughter). Still not nice. So he goes, "Can I go look at the desserts?" and I'm like, "Sure." You know by this point during the week, he has like 500 lesbian moms at this point. All eyes are on him. I'm like, "Go ahead. But be back here in 15 minutes." So he goes to the dessert table. Fifteen minutes past by. Twenty minutes passed by. Twenty- Five minutes pass by. So I'm like, "Oh, great." So I go look for him at the dessert buffet and he's not there. And I'm looking around the dining room. I can't find find him anywhere. And there's too many black kids at this resort. Right? (Laughter). All week long I've been yelling at the wrong kid like, "Get down from there. This - oh, sorry." "No running. As you were, sorry." (Laughter) And then I remember he was going to look at the desserts and then I remembered Thanksgiving. And I was like, "Oh my God." So I'm running to the bathroom because I'm pretty sure he's in there double dragoning even as we speak, right? So I swing open the bathroom door and my son is standing there washing his hands. (Ohhhh). And I could hear a toilet has just flushed. (Laughter). And I'm like, "Did you wipe your booty?" He said "Yes. Daddy, guess what?" I'm like, "What?" "I love you." See that's how they get you. (Laughter) (Laughter) Children drive you absolutely crazy one minute and the next minute they do something or say something so magical that you want to give them everything. In that moment I was like "You know what, baby. You can poo or pee wherever you want. You can poo in my hand. You can poo on my head. (Laughter). You can poo in my mouth." The three of us were walking home that night from the dining room and we were looking up at the sky and my son says, "Pappa, Daddy, look. It's the big dipper." And I was like, "Really? Where?" And he goes, "Right there. You could see the handle. And the ladle andi if you draw a straight line from that star to that star you can find Polaris. It's the North Star. It never moves so you can never get lost. " I was like, "Where'd you learn that?" And he said, "The planetarium. Duh." (Laughter) (Laughter) And I was like, "You know what? Your father and I are glad that you're a genius, but we could do without the tone." (Laughter) And then he said, "Where am I going to go next?" And I was like, "Well, where do you want to go next?" He said, "With you guys." I'm like, "Well the answer to that is easy. We're going home." Now, right about now is when I'd be telling my son a bedtime story so I'm going to do the same for you. Ok? On the day we adopted our son, we took a whole bunch of pictures of the court room and we later found out that that was totally illegal. (Laughter). (Laughter). So not only did we take a whole bunch of pictures but we hired a professional editor to make a slide show. Do you want to see it? (Applause) There's your bedtime story. (Music) Once upon a time there is a little boy named Zion and papa named Jamie and a daddy named Alec. And they wanted more than anything to become a family. And their wish came true. Goodnight.
