Do you, Alice, take Joseph... to be your husband in sickness and in health... until distance do you part? I do. And do you, Joseph, take Alice to be your wife... in sickness and in health until distance do you part? I do. I now pronounce you... man and wife. Joseph! Joseph! Joseph! The Lord has decided that he needed to test us. - Mr. Paul? - The deed has been done. It wasn't a rabbit. You arrogance blinded you, Joseph. We'll note it for Sunday. Now grab one end. He said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of the Lord, your God, and do that which is right in His eyes... ...give ears to His commands and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you that I put on the Egyptians... ...for I am the Lord, your healer." Mr. Paul. Mr. Paul! Mr. Paul! I caught a rat! Don't even think about helping him up. He did this on his own. He can get up on his own. Y'all heard him. Get back to work! Back to work. Back to work, boy. Hold still. Ruthie? You can't be sneaking over here and playing like this. As the oldest woman in this bunch, I think I can do just about anything I want to do. And right now, I want to see my son. Best not to hear those stories tonight, Alice. Her reading's the only thing we got. We can't keep doing this. We thank keep letting Mr. Paul do what he wants. It's a choice we don't have to make. If any one of us start acting up, you know what would happen? We'd all die. There's 12 of us. There's one of him. Three if you count Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Aaron. Not all of us had the teaching from Mr. Paul you had. How? The men that hunt runaways work at night. We've all heard the stories. I ain't never heard of them hunting in the day. It won't work, Alice. She ain't wrong for thinking about it. None of us are. There's got to be something else. A bunch of white men out there waiting... to kill us, keep us, or sell us. I need to speak to my wife. Alone. - Joseph, this place... - Paul knows. About us. About everything. No, my brothers and sisters! This was no messenger from God. This was a warning from the devil himself. Even in our gracious state of Georgia... on God-given land, the devil has ways of sending an emissary. He said, "You must continue to be fruitful. Not only for yourselves, but for your domestic livestock, for they, too, must be bathed in the bounty of birth. Or I will... take it all away." I need to have a word with you. How long has it been since we lost your beloved? Long time ago. I've always tried my best to take care of you. Haven't I? You want to be inside. Is that it? No, sir. A home life. This is what you're longing for, isn't it? When your wife passed... I should've married you off. Could have had sons working by your side. Mr. Paul, I... Our neighbor, Brother Levi, has offered one of his domestics to be your bride. I'm happy, Mr. Paul. I-I work hard. I-I don't need... The message was clear. You need to be fruitful. Along with the other domestics. This... This is a big thing Brother Levi is doing for us. He hasn't been as blessed with his domestics. We've agreed that the first child will rightfully go to him. You'll leave this week to... ...to procreate. And then, when the pregnancy is confirmed, you can return. This is so much bigger than... than us. Daniel's coming home tomorrow. And Rachel. She's been gone a long time now. Your mind's not what it used to be, Mother. It's Sunday. I said it's Sunday. I know. You go on ahead of me. What about Mrs. Bennett? Ruth can put her to bed. Nobody said you could sit there. You think you look like this? I just looked at the picture. I didn't... You don't read good enough to understand... the meaning, Alice. I-I only taught you so you could read to me as a domestic. Understand? Understand? Yes. Good. Sit. On the bed. Have you ever thought about running away? Pondering is only gonna make you feel worse. Have you ever thought about it? We don't... We don't talk about that. I didn't ask if we talked about it. I asked you if you thought about it. Used to. But I just chose not to see things out of my control. That kind of thinking will get you killed. You ever hear stories about anyone making it out? Your granddaddy... ...once said he... he saw a man. One of us. As if... As if he just fell from the sky. Could start a fire with his hands. Mm-hmm. He's still out there. My daddy... buried him over in that... in that corral. Strangest-looking man he'd ever seen. - Did you see him? - Oh, no, I wasn't... I wasn't trying to. What are you doing? What are you doing, son? What are you... We can fix those. You like your schoolin'? Well, I'll bet you have a lot of friends. Not really. Well, you know what that means. You're a smarter person. They don't understand you. A man is rich not by what he owns, but by what he can do without. Mrs. Bennett awake? Mm-hmm. She's in the sitting room. Well, get her. Her grandson's home. Hi, Mr. Daniel. Hi. You hungry? Make something for me and my boy. Can't you see? Mrs. Bennett. Mrs... I was a dancer, you know. In Chicago. Mrs. Bennett... what's out there? The whole world. Don't you see it? I found this. What is it? Something from somewhere. Someone from someplace. Who? Someone like us. There's more than we know... more than we can see. We have to go. - I don't know. - We'll go. If we make it out, we come back for everyone and burn this place to the ground. Aaron's got a gun. You let me worry about that. What if... What if there's nothing out there? I'll take my chances. Will you? Yes. Wait for my signal. "There's a strange land yonder, a land of witchcraft and beautiful things, a land of brave people." - I got this, Daddy. - Hmm? "What is the good of..." "What is the good of talking? It grows dark. Those who live to see will see. 'You need not fear me, Macumazahn, ' he said, interpreting my look." Mr. Aaron! "I dig no holes for you to fall in, I make no plots." You're crazy! - What you want, boy? - I caught a rabbit. Oh. Well... show me. "I-If we..." "If ever we are..." Get inside. Keep reading. No! Go! Go! Go! Run! Go! Run! Go! Don't stop! Don't stop! Go! Go! Go! Run! Run! Go! Run! Go! Mr. Paul! I got him, Mr. Paul! Mr. Paul! Mr. Paul, I got him! I got him! I got him! Mr. Paul. Mr. Paul! I got him! I got him! I got him! I think he's gone. All I ever tried to do... was protect you. Now, you go look. You go look... and you see what betrayal looks like. You go look! What do you say I have Moses make you some new toys? I want to go home. Alice, I want you to sit with us. Sit! Looks good. Don't you think, Daniel? Mm. Alice is a good cook. Be a shame to lose her. Stop! Shut your mouth! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Help me! Use the scold's bridle. No! No! No! No! No! No! You stop! Stop! What did I do to deserve this?! What did I do?! I really liked you, Alice. I really liked you! No! I want to move past this, Alice. The greatest gift God gave to man was forgiveness. Aah! Miss? Miss? Miss, can you hear me? Miss? Miss, you got... Miss... Be cool, man! Miss?! Miss? Miss... Don't give him no peace sign If you don't mean it from your heart - United we can get over - United we can get over - But yet were still apart - But yet were still apart 'Cause each man demands respect and to get an equal share And until you're givin' him that There'll be no peace Brother's gonna work it out Brother's gonna work it out Brother's gonna work it out Brother's gonna work it out Oh, we must all join hands We can march across this land in peace... Be cool! Be cool. Listen. Be cool. Be cool. Ma'am... Be cool. Be cool. Hey. Hey, relax. Do you remember? You fainted. I couldn't leave you out there. How did you get free? When reality's all gone?

We were told that only white people were beautiful, only straight hair, light eyes, light skin. Their own appearance is beautiful. They're proud of it. And white people are aware of it, too, because white people now want natural wigs. They want wigs like this. Dig it? Isn't it beautiful? - Yes. - All right. They say Superwoman. I think they get me confused with... They think I've been in "Cleopatra Jones" and some of these super woman films... That's Pam Grier. She the baddest chick around. I'm always getting beaten up. It's a young woman who's able to get out of a situation on her own, use her instincts. She has to survive. Now back to "Sanford and Son." Are they small people? They're not inside. Yes?

Wrong number. "Slave. Person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them. Suggested, slavery, civil rights." "Emancipation Proclamation. The Emancipation Proclamation was a presidential proclamation and executive order issued by the United States President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863. It changed the federal legal status of more than three million enslaved Blacks in the designated areas of the South from slave... to free." This is American justice. This is American democracy. And those of you who are familiar with it know that in America, democracy is hypocrisy. Now, if I'm wrong, put me in jail. If democracy means justice, why don't we have justice? If democracy means equality, why don't we have equality? And we're gonna say it after this, and after I'm locked up and after everybody's locked up, that you can jail a revolutionary, but you can't jail a revolution. ...are administrating this movement now to eradicate those oppressive... We will not stop until we have won. No, no, I will never that progress is being made. If you stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, there's no progress. If you pull it all the way out, that's not progress. The progress is healing the wound that the blow made. And they haven't even begun to pull the knife out, much less try and heal the wound. They won't even admit the knife is there. Free... Free. I'm free. I'm free. Civil rights. Emancipation Proclamation. Slavery. I'm free. I've been free. Ooh. Hello. Is this Rachel? Yes.

Can you believe that? We gave him that one shot. Damn immigrants. Man, I'll tell you. What you... What you want me to tell him? Get rid of him. And his wife, too. - What did she do? - Oh, come on, man. You know she had to know. I don't think neither one of them would have anything to do with that. Oh, come on. That's how they do. "That's how they do"? Alice. You didn't have to make me nothing. I wanted to. It's good. Listen. We got to figure out what you have to do. Maybe some woman's home or some place they can help you get your memory back. I haven't lost my memory. - You may think... - I haven't lost my memory. I know exactly who I am and where I came from. These books told me. Who are you then? I'm me. I know, Alice. I know you Alice. But who are you? My whole life's been a lie, Frank. Not just part. Not the kind of lies people tell themselves to get by. The whole thing. So, who are you? I was a slave, Frank. Do you... Do you know what you're saying? Do you? I know exactly what I'm saying. No, do you? Do you really know what you're saying right now? Listen. Alice, I need you to tell me who you really are - or whoever it is... - I just told you who I was. Alice... You need to get somebody that can help you. Why can't you help me? Because I'm nobody. I'm meeting somebody tomorrow. Somebody... I knew. That's... That's good. That's... That's great. You... You want me to take you? I'd like that. Through the mirror of my mind Time after time I see reflections of you and me Reflections of The love you took from me Oh, I'm all alone now No love to shield me Trapped in a world that's A distorted reality Through the mirror of my mind Through these tears that I'm crying Reflects a hurt I can't control 'Cause although you're gone I keep holding on To the happy times Ooh, when you were mine As I peer through the window Of lost time Looking over my yesterdays And all the love I gave all in vain All the love All the love that I've wasted All the tears All the tears that I've tasted All in vain Through the hollow of my tears I see a dream that's lost From the hurt That you have caused Everywhere I turn Seems like everything I see Reflects the love that used to be In you I put All my faith and trust Right before my eyes It's Rolling Stone. How do I look? Like you. Just a handful of promises Are all that's left of loving you All the love All the love that I've wasted All the tears All the tears that I've tasted All in vain You gonna be okay going to see your friend? She was never my friend. She ain't your friend? That's right. How does that work? Just does. You need me to come with you? No. Sit anywhere you want. Just you? I'm waiting on somebody. Coffee? I-I'm looking for someone, a woman. There's a lot of women here. A Negro woman. - Take it easy. - Take care. Alice. You look so different. You don't. Self-seating. Sweetie, turn that down. He's obsessed with that thing. I hid it in his suitcase when he went to see Paul. Any coffee? I'm shocked he didn't find it. I heard it. I'm hungry, Alice. I'm not here to serve you. Why don't you go check out that machine while mommy talks, okay? Alice... I'm not afraid of you anymore. You should never have been afraid. We always wanted to provide a safe place for our domestics. Yes. That includes discipline. But every home needs structure. Life before people got confused about their place, and it was a lot less hard... I was never confused. I was lied to. You blame me? I always thought of you as family. Stop with the lies, Rachel. My family died so yours could leave. I am not the devil, Alice. No, the devil got to you long before you left. - I am learning every... - Enough. Why'd you ask me here if I can't talk? Because this whole thing, me sitting across from you, this ain't about you. This is about me seeing you for exactly what you are. Outside of that backwards world I was born into to believe - you were actually somebody. - Alice... I thought if I could see you out in the open, It might stop me from thinking about hunting down and doing something to make sure you never forget my name. - Watch it, Alice. - But Daniel needs at least one parent. Alice! I'm not scared. And that should scare you... - Alice! - Shut the hell up! It's my turn now. You left us there to die. You watched us get tormented. And you thought I wanted to meet up with you just to hear you talk. I don't give a damn about your life. Freedom... is something you will never understand in a million years. I am freedom. Daniel! Daniel! - Alice. - Frank? Daniel, come. Come. - Y'all need to leave. - Alice, wait. Wait, Alice. Hey, hey, hey. You got a bill. - What about Alice? - Get in the car right now! Rachel! Don't... You let them get away! Go to hell! Alice... I have to go back. Nah, you can't go back. What you talking about? You know what will happen to you? Everybody that's ever cared about me is still there. I got to get them out. I'm'a need some more books. What would you do? Kill all of them? Well, why not? Nothing else seems to do any good. You know who they are. Everybody knows who they are. And the law is in for a piece of the action. So, you want to play with knives? You want to spit on me and make me crawl, white motherfucker? Well, you picked the wrong player. It seems like I'm in a dream. And I'm still in this dream, and it wouldn't take much for me to kill you now. Shit. Look. I ain't gonna shoot you. I'm gonna piss on your grave tomorrow. What'd you think? She wasn't real. Was she? What she believed in, what she stood for was. Right on. You said you was going back. I am. What's going on, Alice? I'm going back. Tomorrow. You can't go back by yourself. - The police ain't gonna help... - Police? Them folk that's supposed to help people. Well, they help some people sometimes. You can't help me? You still do what your brother tells you. So you no different than me. But you used to stand for something... the marches, the sit-ins. I saw them in your memory box. Frank. What happened to you? What happened... was I spent a decade of my life trying to help the cause. and make a change for the people. That's what happened to me. You know what changed. My mother died, and I got older, and the leaders got killed, and everybody just stopped trying. That's what happened. But you can make a change. You can make a change now. Something that's bigger than yourself. Like Coffy. Oh, Alice. Oh, no. Just... A Black man trying to do something for hisself. Where is that gonna happen in America? That's a death certificate. You understand me? I'm asking myself to get killed doing that. That's what that is. Where is that gonna happen? You tell me that. But you can do something. You ain't got no birth certificate or no Social Security, no I.D. You... You can do what you want. I didn't expect you to say yes, but just so you know, doing the right thing is never wrong. I'm wrong because I can't help you. No. You're wrong... 'cause you don't believe. Not any more. What's your plan? We might need these. You came out right about here. That's the service road right there. You want to take the road? For what we want to do, we better. Yeah, then everybody can see the truth. What's public transit? It's a bus, Alice. It pick people up and take them where they need to go. - You sure you want to do this? - I'm sure. Well, tomorrow night, if you change your mind at any time, they don't make you weaker. We can figure out how to get everybody out. Like what? Well, everything don't work out as planned. I used to dream of breaking my mom out of that hospital. Why didn't you? I didn't believe I could. Frank. I'm not backing out. Hello. Alice. Frank. Frank. I can't do it. I can't. I just... I can't do it. And, Alice, I don't think you should do it either. I really don't... Alice? You all right? Nodding's not an answer, Frank. You okay? Frank? Nodding is an answer, Danny. Be cool. Nah. You be cool. I've been cool for a long time. What's this? What this is, is I'm telling you to get out my face. I'm my own man. I think for myself. And you know what a motherfucking nod is. Hi. Hello. Get in. It's better than the bus. 10-8, there's a wildfire on the I-55 highway. Copy that. What's your 20? A service road right off the Hitchcocks exit, 34A. Fire truck en route. Thought I knew better. I'm proud of you. Your mama... would be proud of you. Hurry your asses up! Hurry your asses up! All right! Gather up! Get everyone behind the house! Alice? Who'd you think it was gonna be? You ain't gonna win this fight. Get your ass back. You're not gonna leave here again. At least not in one piece. Get inside. Sit. On the bed. What do you want, Alice? I want... everyone to see the truth. Well, all they're gonna see is fire, and thanks to you, they're gonna work through the night, putting it out. No. No, they're not. My family's done working for you. It's over. Everything you hid from us, all the lies you told to make yourself feel important... it's all coming down right before your eyes. Some things... you can't hide forever. I'm smarter than you. I'm better than you. And I know that scares you. How does it feel? I gave you all a meaningful life! Meaningful. This tradition was born long before you. Alice, you j... You don't make sense. I never told anyone that they had to stay. I just never told them that they could go. What are you gonna do? Hmm? You gonna kill me? I'm gonna make sure your last few breaths feel like hell. Well, Hell, Alice... - Is where you're going! - ...is where you're going!
