Like just looking around really flashes. Like this asphalt. Used to play baseball all summer on the asphalt. You gradually get some hot hops off asphalt and let me tell you, it burns. And trying to play football on the lawn with the sprinklers is a trip. Yeah...I don't know. See them bikes? I had a bike when I was a kid, man. It was a composite of about twenty other guys' bikes. There were five of us running around all day ripping them off. We used to strip them down in this gully, man. We had an assembly down there for the whole neighborhood. They got a police-station built on top of that gully now. On third street. Brand new. Sure is ugly. Kids. What do you tell kids, man? Didn't tell me nothing when I was that age. Fuck. Pretty weird shit. Pretty weird. - You got it then for free? - 'Yeah, but shit it..' (Billy) 'Don't do you any good. It's just..' - For looks. - 'Yeah.' - Looks. - 'True.' That's all I wanted. For its looks. - 'What about you?' - Hmm? (female#1) 'How come you're here?' My mom wouldn't let me have it. (female #1) 'Why not?' She said I couldn't afford it. I traded my motorcycle. I had it for one day and had to take it back. So why don't you get one now? I plan to, one day. I don't know what.. Couldn't get a hit. And if I did, then when I, I did the tie and started to hit it the vein would sink right from out of the needle and I'd miss. Uh-huh.

[car honking] Sure spend a lot of time sitting slack-jawed and stoop-shouldered in parks, man. Noddin' sometimes. Lot of people think dope fiends have got horns on their heads and snaggle teeth, running around raping young broads. That ain't the way it is. I'm just an everyday dope fiend. Registered, card-carrying, first-class. Like where I live, man, dope is nothin'. Just an everyday common thing. Shootin' dope is weird. You know like it ain't nothin'. And after you get off in it, man, it's just, you know rips your brain off and sits down on the bottom of your stomach and that's you. Dope, man, all the time, every day, all day. Hunting for bread. That's what it is. Goin' to supermarkets and throwin' fits while your partner's running out the back with the stash. I don't know, man. And baseball was a big stick of mine. I really dug it. I played a lot of ball for.. All three years in high-school I played on city champ.. Two years on city championship teams and three years on Southern League championship teams. I made honorable mention and All-City. Had some good years, man. I had a lot of fun. Had scouts lookin' at me, but I was usin' dope. Light-weight but I was still usin' then. Coach kept wondering when I was gonna get serious. Like what my bag was, he didn't know. The whole team was loaded. We were city champs. It was like all our school ever produces was baseball players and dope fiends. Like when I went to Salt Lake the three years I stayed back, I played professional softball for General Electric. We were state championship teams, two year. And Rocky Mountain region champions, one year. Went to one world tournament. If you really think somethin's happening you oughta try playin' baseball when you're loaded on stuff. It's a heavy trip. Didn't fuck with my batting too much but I sure was slow behind the plate. I used to catch.. I was wonderin' who was catching who. The ball or me? I don't know, I like baseball, fishing and shooting dope. I think I'd put broads in there too. They' re heavy. But they're losers. I paid my dues alright. I went through two wives. And I lost about four cars to the state. For transporting. And like I said I blew about eight, nine years of my life. Like I keep thinking back.. '...I'm glad it's over.' 'I'm glad I'm still alive.' 'I went through all them cycles. You know, the Rat Packer era.' 'Low riding them down the Boulevard.' I got scar tissue on my chest from riding so low. Tattoos all over it. Burned out veins. Sloop-shouldered. And I still can't stand or sit straight. (male #5) 'Good morning.' - You the guy here? - 'Can I help you?' Yeah, I, I want a tape. - You know, the best. - The best kind? - Yeah. - Okay. I don't know about the cassette. What else you got? Oh, I have Craig. - Alright. - That's the best system. What about Sony? I heard about the Sony. That's, uh, Japs really got it together. Well, it's not bad but, uh, we don't have it. - You like Norelco, huh? - Norelco's the best. It's Swedish, isn't it? Or something like that? No, it's German. German, huh? I don't know. Let me show you one of the tape decks. I'll show you. Can you.. Can you, can you order a Sony? - No, it takes too long. - Uh-huh. Well. Let me show you the, the set here. We'll have somebody take it in. How come you don't handle 'em anyway? They should be on stock, shouldn't they? 'It's had a lot of problems with it.' 'Let me show you this one.' 'Set it underneath the dash there.' It looks like a radio. 'We've had too much problems with the, uh, say the Sony.' - Yeah? - 'Put it right in there.' 'You know you also should have the radio removed' 'and, is there a radio in there?' - Yeah. - 'Right in between the seats.' 'Right in between the seats.' - 'What do you think of that?' - Sure looks little. 'Well, that's the whole solid state. Compact.' - Sure that's the best? - 'That's the best.' - 'Can we put it in for you?' - That's what I'm here for. - 'Okay.' - 'Don't you got a bigger one?' Why do you want a bigger one? There's no room. Or put it where people can see it? 'You wanna show it?' - Yeah. - 'How about over there?' Yeah, so that somebody can tell I got it. You know. 'Wanna trust me? I'll do you a real nice job.' Okay. That's my...job to make sure that you-- Yeah, yeah, sure. You go ahead. You like it right there? Well.. I don't care. Yeah, that's good. What do you think? I'm, I'm partial to Craig really. - Craig? Think that's better? - Yeah. I had one, it got ripped off. So I didn't buy any more. How'd you like it? Good sounds came out of it. Had some speakers in the doors and the back. Yeah, before you get started, is the Craig as good as-- Craig's just as good. Sure. Uh, what's the difference in price? - About ten dollars. - Which one's more? - This one is ten dollars more. - Okay, put it in. [engine revving] [instrumental music] (male on radio) '...on the Big K' 'remember tonight and all this weekend on..' [engine revving] I guess what we're here about what I'm here about.. ...is mainly talking about a young boy's cock in America. I've got one. And it's not particularly unusual. And I do certain things with it. And other people do certain things with it. And sometimes we do it in the road. And sometimes we do it in your son's bedroom. And sometimes we do it in your daughter's bedroom. And you probably wouldn't like it at all. But I do. It's not all of what I'm about. And that doesn't matter because that's none of your business. And I mean everything I say. Or something not unlike it. 'It's no way for a kid to come in out of the country.' 'You know if the country were really a good place to be.' 'But the system sucks, all of it, man.' 'Yeah, from the President right on down.' 'They got little keys in the back.' 'And you wind them up, and they walk and they talk.' 'That's just.. the country's twisted, man.' And unless, unless something happens unless we tear it all down and start all over again from the beginning... it's not gonna work. It's gonna burn out. We're gonna go right into the ocean. And that's gonna be the end of it. And that's too bad. Because we had a good chance. If we got a chance now,we gotta do it again and not blow it. Next time we go to the shop I'm gonna pay it for you. - 'Good. I'll give you a call.' - Send me the bill. You ever down at the Whiskey some evening? - 'I..' - C'mon down. (male #6) 'I would love to come down but the music' 'the noise, the kids--' We've got a private room just for people like you. [indistinct chatter] Family's alright, right? - 'Great.' - 'Great.' But I need to get to Minnesota. 'I took all that Minnesota money and loved it.' - You made a bundle? - Right. Save yourself money. - 'We can't raise their price.' - 'So what else is new?' - 'Where did it come from?' - 'Marseilles.' - 'Marseilles? Like last time.' - 'Right.' 'I even cut it five or six times.' (male #6) 'Rocco?' It looks pure, it's white. Same thing as before. Same thing. 'Well, Mario...I love doin' business with you.' Hey, you're a great guy yourself. (male #6) 'Rocco.' 'They always have to look at it, right?' Looks good. (male #7) 'It's a 140,000, Robert.' (male #6) 'Mario, say hello to the wife. Listen, Monday.' - '11 o' clock.' - '11 o' clock, fine.' - 'Good idea.' - 'Alright, fine.' Fine, same place. (male #6) 'I'll give you a call.' Right. Say hello to Kansas City. - 'Say hello to the wife.' - I'll do that. (male #6) 'Rocco, get rid of that shit. Will you take it in?' [engine revving] - 'So much better than you--' - 'Listen to the bitch.' I can get doped so quickly, I certainly don't need you. Then do it. Fine. I even paid for what you're eating right now. Look, you'd be so helpless without me, man. - Will I really? - Yes, you really would. Oh man. I know you're saying it. The way you're fuckin' saying it just really makes me feel like getting myself together. You wouldn't know how to get yourself toget.. How exactly do you want me to react? You know, I hope that by showing you what an asshole you are maybe you'll get up and prove me wrong. Why not try doing something besides what you're doing now? - Like what? - Get a job. Get yourself together. Stand on your own feet-- Don't you want me in here every time you OD? That would be a good start, shit. You got something else to rank me about. I wasn't making tacos, huh? Shit. You don't know how it is to make anything. You can't even make me. You can't even fuck me. - Oh, fuck you. - You're totally incapable. At least I keep you loaded. All we can do is hold hands. Totally incapable of anything else. Chicken, TV, crossword puzzles and shitty hotels. Our life. I couldn't even have a fucking kid if I want one. - How does that make you feel? - Is that what you want? A kid? You're totally incapable of giving me one. You really think so? Do I have one? You burn so strung out it'd probably die anyway. If you didn't drop it the next time you passed out in the bathroom. Oh, fuck. 'You can't even fix yourself.' There's one way to learn, isn't there? It feels great. It really feels great to hear you say that. Just really makes me feel like jumping up right off my ass. There's one reason why we're together. There's one reason why we're together. 'What is that? What is that?' - Dope. - 'You really think so?' 'Listen, I'm really sorry to get on your case but..' '...there's nobody else to blame but you.' I'm sorry you get on my case too. Listen, just forget it, alright? Just, you know. Let's just go to sleep and.. ...what usually happens will happen again. I'm really sorry. I really love you, man. It's okay, baby. I really don't need the dope. You know, I really love you, that's really enough but.. ...I guess our love will just have to be enough. Uh, it's the first time I ever OD'd. I just OD'd. Well, I'm being a pig. It isn't that I, I, you know, got fooled or I came across a better quantity or it was stronger. It's just that I was getting off every hour, hour and a half I was so loaded I forgot that I had gotten off. And I got off about three or four times. Right in a row. I didn't know I'd gotten off each time before and ended up ODing for the first time. And it scared me 'cause, for two reasons. Scared me because I'd have to kick it. And I've never kicked a habit like that. And.. And I was scared what'll happen when the connection left. When I lost, what would I do then if I was on the street. It's just the whole thing was a bummer. Plus the way I started to act, I never.. ..I've never been so cold blooded on the street. Even when things were really bad and I was having a hard time making money, it got so, uh.. ...I just didn't think about anything. I swear.. Uh.. The $100 bags, if I was selling it to people who deal and if somebody bought a $100 bag what they'd do is probably take half of it and cut it twice. And they'd make about four times their money back. They'd make about $400. I was, I was selling enough dope that I was shooting between 9 to 12 quarter Ts of it before it was cut. And when I added it all up after I got busted in jail and I was curious to know what I'd been shooting it's about 400 to 450, around there I was shooting it. I could've made, if I'd cut it, sold it instead of shooting it not including what the other people were shooting I don't know what that was. Oh. Oh, when I, no, when, when I realized.. 'Two people I was living with had similar habits' 'and they were fixing my cop.' I'd get two fix in, and I'd leave nothing but a cot.. And they would fix and get loaded and nod out next to me. That scared me 'cause I realized how much I was doing. It was almost like I wasn't human. I should've been dead doing that much. It was weird. (man on radio) 'It's 9:05 on Saturday morning, darlin'' 'and our Solid Gold Weekend is movin' right on.' * The willow weeps and having wept can weep no more * * But still it cries for me It cries in sympathy * * It knows that you are gone * * Don't leave me baby * * There was a time when you were mine * * And not so long ago I used to say * * You'd never go away * * You'd never leave me lonely * * Don't leave me baby * * Think about the happy times the groovy times * * Don't tell me they are gone I just can't carry on * * I know that you're not here * * You're not near anymore * * Whoa whoa * * Don't leave me baby Things are gonna work out fine * * Don't leave me baby think I'm going out of my mind * * Don't leave me baby * * Don't leave me behind * * Babe babe babe baby yeah * * Babe babe babe baby yeah * * Babe babe babe baby yeah * * Babe babe babe baby yeah * * The willow weeps and having wept can weep no more * * But still it cries for me * * It cries in sympathy * * It knows that you are gone ** I was born and raised in this city right here, man. This is my town, my home. Yeah. Like no matter where I go I always end up comin' back here. This is where I was born, man. This is where I always end up. I'm a dope fiend. I get it. It ain't no big thing to me. Like where I live, everybody is. Like, you see, like, you know what, like, just, just just sit here cold, man, and try and run it down. It's just too heavy, it's too much. Like I get to thinking about it I don't know where to start my feelings. Like every fuckin' wall I look at, man every fuckin' piece of sidewalk, man it springs back too fuckin' much, man. Like I'm goin' back to when I was 8-9, 7-6 years old. I can start then, man. Keep on going, man. Like every place represents something. Can you just make a right here? When you drive around here and check out these houses look at these people, you don't know what you're lookin' at. Like, you don't know what's happenin' around here. Like, you know, like all these houses along in here you know what, like I have shot dope with so many of these men 'and laid up on so many of these lawns' 'and talked shit to so many of these people.' And ran all over this. I know that sidewalk, man. Every fuckin' ditch. 'You name it, man. Right in here, this is me, man.' 'My blood runs up and down these fuckin' streets.' 'Like, lot of these people, man. Like, they're underpaid, man.' 'They ain't got nothin', but three squares a day' and a, and a fucking old, old wooden pad, man. And they're pissed off at life. They just grow up pissed off at life. The cemetery over there on the left? That's where we used to ditch all the heat, man. 'Anytime, everything happened there all we had to do was run' 'jump that hedge, get off there. They couldn't come get us.' 'They were scared or didn't know where they were going.' 'All the Barrymores are buried in there, man.' 'Lot of famous people, man. It's a big place.' Right here, man where this bus is turning around in front of us street cars used to come down the middle of this street. I bounced off the side of one of them street car 'that turned in front of me on a motorcycle.' Jumped a curve, ran into three old ladies waiting for a bus. I ended up in a yard full of headstones, man. Fucked up, man. Didn't know what was happening. Got up and picked up my cycle and started cryin', man. (male #1) 'This is your favorite chicken though?' (male #2) 'Yes.' 'She, uh, she grew up with us, you know.' 'She was a little chicken, the only small one we had.' 'She was out by the chicken coop. I went..' I noticed one day she was missing and so I went back in the house and I told them we got a chicken missing. Susan and Carol, they got upset about it. And we looked for her, we couldn't find her. I...I had two drinks of hot chocolate and, uh, I had to go to the head. And I went out to the old outhouse, the shit hid there. It's one of these three-seat things, you know? And I heard the noise down there, flappin' or somethin'. Couldn't figure out what the heck down down in the hole. The chicken was down in the shitter? Yeah, so I went on to the house and I told dad. I says, "Henny Penny's down there." And I was really upset about it. My favorite chicken. And he says, "We'll get her out. Get some rope and you can go down there and get her" - I wouldn't really want to. - 'You go down there?' I can go down there and get her. So he takes this rope and puts it about here on me and says, "Hold on. I'll lower you down." So I get down in the hole like this. It was a...you know the type of rope you have for clotheslines? - Oh, yeah, real thin shit. - Yeah. And I was down gettin' ready to go in. He's, you know, standing here like this. And I was kinda holdin' on the edge balancing myself. And I was about halfway down this hole and this rope 'cause he got it off the clothesline, it snapped. And I go holding on the side like this but I just kept on sliding down, like "blatt." Right into that shit. Up to here? Well, somewhere around here. I was about 10 feet down looking up there, you know, ugh. Help, you know? And dad says, "We haven't got any more rope I gotta go downtown and get some more. - What? - Downtown and get more rope. And I gotta stay down that hole with that smell all that time. That chicken.. - You were stuck in that shit? - So was the chicken, yeah. And his wings are all messed up, it's gettin' all over my face. And so I'm stayin' down there and people lookin' down there. "What you doin'?" You know? "Have fun," "goodbye cruel world" and all this stuff. Uh-huh. "Don't make any waves," there's that one, too. Yeah. - So he got back anyway? - He got back and hauled me up. And I stunk. I had the chicken. I had the chicken in my arms. I gave him the chicken, you know? I gave him the chicken, he put it down. I came out and I says, "I ain't keepin' these clothes." Hell. I-I just took 'em off right out in the yard and we threw it in the incinerator. We had this old barrel we burned stuff in. Oh, my God. [car engine cranks] Want me to turn it off? C'mon, man, you're a crazy motherfucker. - Cool it, man. - Oh, man. C'mon. - I'll do it again. - Nice fuckin' outfit, man. - Just a minute. - Hey, what happened, man? - Spike went down the drain. - Oh, fuck, man. - No, wait a minute, man. - What do you mean? - 'It went down the drain.' - 'I'll take care of it.' (male #1) 'Wait a minute, man. Just wait a minute.' Dumb motherfucker, you're fucking with my high now. You're too fuckin' much. Wait a minute. I'll go get something. - Just hang tight, man. - Get something for what? 'Hey, wait a minute!' (male #1) 'I got your points man, I got you some 25 fivers' 'disposable DDs.

Just fucked up. But I need you, baby. 'Really need you.' I'd be just fuckin' nowhere, man, without you. I'd be nowhere. I'm sorry, man. I just wanna taper off. Well, what do you wanna do? - 'Whack it, man.' - 'Okay.' 'Okay, it's enough.' Alright, man. 'The point's clogged.' 'We got those twenty sixes. Want to do what we talked about? I'm gonna go get this ready. - Hey, I'm first. - You think you're going first? 'I'm all ready.' Why do I always have to go through this? 'It's my turn.' You got off first last time.

I just walked outta that bar. How do you know what I want? I don't know. Wanna go home and make some coffee? Yeah, sure. - A weird night. - Yeah. It's-- - Cold. - Yeah, it's cold too. I come here sometimes.. ...with freaks, people gassing everybody else. It's the same kind of insanity, I guess. (male #1) 'Oh, can you dig it, man, like. like you know' 'like, a good LA dope fiend spends half of his adult life' 'in that place waitin', man.' 'They got, marks laws, they got paraphernalia laws' 'they got possession laws, they got sales laws' 'they got laws on top of laws in-laws and a bottle of law.' 'Like I spent eight months up there at once, man.' 'Five of the eight were as a mattress runner.' 'I was runnin' outfits all over that jail' makin' me half a grand a day, and $25 a day for hustlin' the outfits from the different tanks on the different floors but I could go on any floor and do anything. Like, you can't imagine what it's like. It's famous man, in the '50s it was integrated I mean, segregated. They had the hypes broke up in their in their own tank. They had the money and action in the whole fuckin' jail. Did everything we wanted. We had so much money that we're bailin' each other out so we could go score. Like the guys would come in with $500 marks bail, man. We'd bail him out, give him $500 then go get a piece and come back. Get him in the court line and get him runnin' all over. It's just a big trip. I've had my ass whipped in there so much you wouldn't believe it. On that elevator, between the ninth and tenth floor They'd stop, four of 'em, punch around in a circle. A heavy trip, man. Lot of people don't know that goes on. When they hear it, they don't wanna believe it. It's the truth. It happens every day, all day. I'll bet you now somebody's gettin' his ass whipped and ain't gonna snivel about it, man. You know, first of all because the cops don't like it and the guys don't like it. You just gotta hold it. Every time I go there, I still duck my head involuntarily. It's just like a reflex, you know. Like, even like, I'm sitting here right now 'thinking about it, I think, if they knew I was here now' 'they would be down here kickin' the fuck out of me.' 'That would be alright, man. You know.' ''Cause I could fight back now, up there you can't fight back.' 'You just put your head in some grate, man.' 'Can you imagine livin' in a toilet bowl for eight months?' 'You cook in a toilet bowl, wash in it, you shave in it.' 'You do everything including shit in that toilet bowl' 'and it's the cleanest part of the cell, man.' 'I can still remember sittin' on that top bunk and facin' life' for a sail, man, feeling like diving off in that toilet bowl the first couple of days. I'd be sitting there thinking about it "just take a nose dive down the shitter, end up in Long Beach." That's a saying up there, "send it to Long Beach" 'cause all the pipes lead to Long Beach, man. It's a heavy trip. It's good to be here talkin' about it not up there lookin' at it. There's guys up there now hanging on them bars staring, wondering what the hell I'm doing, man. You know. [whistling] Yeah, fuck it. (male #1) 'Clean this.' This thing really scoots, don't it? I'd like to be right up here some time. Just like this, kinda.. Waa! [chuckling] 'You don't dig it, huh?' Uh, I'm not really into it, I guess. 'Huh.' 'Fuck.' I don't know how you can't be into that, you know. Don't you like second gear, you know gettin' that feet, pushed back the seat, all that? Doesn't do nothin' for you at all? I'd get it off. That's far out. Sure looks bitchin', don't it? I could paint it. Kinda like it the way it is though. Sure gets looked at a lot. Damn, yeah, I'd just drive down, you know put my fuckin' arm out there. What the fuck do you do anyway? Uh...I don't know, just trip I guess. Just hitchhikin' all the time, is that the scene? 'It's time to walk.' 'Yeah.' Do you get into that? 'No, I don't get into that.' No. It's not my style. 'What do you think about mags?' I never thought much about them. - 'You're kidding.' - No, I'm not. 'I could sure handle a beer, man.' Yeah, that is the best part of Texas I think, man. It's the beer. I had nothin' but bad times there, really. Really shitty, actually. How come? Oh, I don't know, it was just.. Everything was just kinda weird. Had a, had a really, uh...kind of a.. That's about the only thing I remember. Was this, uh, gangbangs ...trip we had. You know, it was a, it's a whole bunch of guys and, uh...and this chick in a car.. ...and we just, uh, everybody would just go in, you know and, uh, I went in. And, it, uh, it didn't happen, you know I just didn't wanna make it. I couldn't get it together or something. I don't know. I stayed in 10 minutes longer than anybody else. And, uh, came out, you know, I...had my hair all fucked up buttoning my pants and shit.. ...and then she came out...cryin.' Most of the people I know in Texas are assholes. (male on radio) '...Arnie Ginsberg on a Solid Gold Sunday' 'with the Monotones and the "Book Of Love."' * I wonder wonder who oo-uu who * * Who wrote the book of love * * Tell me tell me tell me * * Oh who wrote the book of love * * I've got to know the answer was it someone from above * * I wonder wonder who be-do-do who * * Who wrote the book of love * * I love you darlin' * * Baby you know I do * * But I've got to see this book of love * * Find out why it's true * * I wonder wonder who be-do-do who * * Who wrote the book of love ** 'Oh, I don't know what you mean.' 'I don't know what you mean, it's not true.' - I like you this way.. - 'What way?' - The way we are right now. - Really? Strung out? Yeah. - That's a burnout line. - It's mysteriously romantic. Hm. No one else is like us, no one. No one we know is like us. That's good enough. Oh, no. I don't know. I guess you're right. It's nice to think about it though. Really is. That's good enough for me.. ...in any case. You know, I remember, when I first started high school and I was taking dope 'always so paranoid I was gonna get busted' that I changed schools about eight times I went to about eight different high schools. I remember around about the fourth high school only time I had ever OD'd, yeah, well, shit. Other than the times you've OD'd with me did you ever OD, I mean, really bad? 'I OD'd once, I was at a friend of mine's house.' And, uh, I had taken some two ml's then I shot some stuff, and then I went out, oh God I turned blue, then I turned yellow. 'I turned every color you can imagine. Blue, white, gray..' - Like me, when I go out? - 'Right, right.' 'But there I was, gettin' slapped' 'walked around and pushed for about six hours' 'and there was this chick there who had given me the shot' 'who fixed it up for me, I didn't know how big it was.' What did she look like? This fat ugly pig from New York. - Why were you with her? - I wasn't. She was staying in the house. When I woke up in the morning, she was givin' me a hand. - I couldn't even feel it. - Did you like it? - I couldn't even feel it. - You had to feel it. I could only see it, I couldn't feel it. [chuckling] I woke up and I saw it, you know.. I don't wanna hear things like that. I never did anything like that. 'You mean nobody ever did anything like that to you?' No. 'Oh...I'm not so sure about that.' - Don't you believe me? - 'Mm-hmm.' No really. You know that. 'If you say so.' (Beverly) 'You never gave me head when I OD'd.' 'All you did was have all the neighbors stand around.' We could've got righteously caught behind that. Behind what? They knew I wasn't an epileptic even though you told them I was. Yeah. I didn't think they were really gonna believe that. Many of them were laughing. "Help me put her in my bathtub, she'll come out of it." - She's just having seizures. - She's just having seizures. (Beverly) 'If we had enough, if we had ten pounds' 'we could live for ever and we'd never have to go out and cop.' (male #1) 'We could sleep forever.' No, with five, ten pounds, I wouldn't wanna do very much. 'No matter how much dope we have, it's not the answer.' 'Even though we've never had anything like that' no matter how much we have-- 'Because you've never had that much we can't figure 'that's not the answer 'cause we don't know. Right?' No matter how much we have it just gets fuckeder and fuckeder. More fucked. Excuse me. - 'Fuckeder and fuckeder.' - 'It's more fucked each time.' (Beverly) 'I see you're getting more intelligent also.' 'I'll stop saying fuckeder.' - 'More fucked.' - 'Start saying more fucked up.' (Beverly) 'More fucked up, yeah, you know.' Yeah, I know. (Beverly) 'You need a shave.' 'Ooh.' 'Shave tonight.' (male #9) 'On your hamburger, you like what?' (female #2) 'Chili and onions, cut the mustard.' (male #9) 'Okay.' Do you want anything to drink? Yeah, Coke. We'll have a Coke too. - 'How about a Fanta' - Okay. Okay with that? (male #10) 'Next, next. Somebody, anybody.' Thank you. I don't like onions. - I love them onions. - Want some of them? Yeah, here. I get a lotta onions. - What're you doin'? - Giving you my onions. I don't like 'em. I know, I got enough onions. (male #11) 'They'll be in a green Volkswagen.' 'If they see you coming..' - 'You know the license plate?' - 'No.' (male #12) 'But it's green and they're around the Whiskey a lot.' - 'Are they armed?' - 'No.' - 'Okay, good.' - 'Thanks a lot.' (female #3) 'Morning, when I got up, it took me an hour' 'to an hour and a half to fix, be covered with blood' 'sometimes I get so pissed off, I just squirt my hit' 'out all over the walls.' 'People I was stayin' with would be sitting there' freaking and bitchin'. They were volunteering to fix my blood and everything else. It was groovy. The dope was good. [laughing] But it really isn't groovy. And my connection turned out to be a turning in all the people he dealt to. Used to front us a lot of dope. What a trip and then he'd set 'em up I found out. The most I ever saw was about an ounce, one ounce. Um.. The most I ever made was when I was selling $100 bags. You really make a lot if you sell small quantities too on the street. It's risky and I don't wanna do it. I'm not so scared of the police as I am scared of the junkies. You know, I gotta make sure I know who I am selling to. Is he a snitch or not? Because that's when it gets really treacherous. You should know who you are selling it too. Then.. 'Where were you, where were you living when you were doing?' In Berkley, in an apartment. Sometimes, uh, sometimes, whenever I've dealt in the street I stayed in hotel rooms. Changed hotel room every day. Changed hotels, rotate between three hotels changed rooms every day. You know, get all my different names and stuff don't tell anybody where you live. Never tell anybody where you live. I liked it, you know what I really missed when when I am not using, when I'm in jail? Is hustling, trying to get the money it's funny but when you're on the street and you're hustling it's like it's a drag because you're sick and you're working for the money and it's a drag and you always bitch about it. But like, when I'm straight and I don't have to hustle I'm so bored. There's a real thrill about like getting that bread like when you trick somebody. You know, it's a real trip. Like when I used to cash checks. I'd walk into that store, man, and I'd just talk to them like they were crazy like I actually had the money. And I talk to him about the most ridiculous thing. I couldn't believe and then I get something it's really just a neat feeling. I don't know, I can't explain it. It's kinda really horrible. Kind of vicious or something. [waves roaring] LA was up there.. Right here in Hollywood. and, uh, up in, uh, Portland. A friend of mine had little we rushed to the hospital and he had rat poison. Rat poison? Rat poison, people get tripped out they wind up doing stupid stuff. Yeah, man, lotta bad smack comin' outta Portland. That's right. Really got to be dumb. Very dumb to take anything. Well, I don't know about that. Well, right now I-I've got this kick about being kind of natural with my own body. I don't. I-I'd only smoke a J. It ain't gonna hurt me but, I, I don't want really.. - Yeah, but.. - ...do anything that.. - ...you could buy uppers-- - ...kills his soul you know. Those uppers will fuck you up too. Yeah ,that's what I was on. They really mess you up. I had to take.. To get up in the morning my joint. I had to get three to get moving. 'Just don't give it to him..' [indistinct chatter] What is it? Turn. 'Turn is good.' 'A good count?' Good count, you dig it. 'Police, uh..' If it ain't good, you ain't gonna roll. .. right now like, they are trying to I don't know if they passed it or they are trying to pass a No Narc Law where they just come right in. They just come right in, you know. - There's another thing. - That's invasion of privacy. 'There's another thing they're into is' 'is preventative detention. You ever heard of that?' 'That's, that's when they, they arrest you for something.' And then they don't let you out because they think that you might create, you know might commit a crime or something like that so.. Yeah, right, so they keep you in, can you believe that? Just on their say so. They say, you know, like whenever they make up their mind that you might do something, you know. Man, that's completely against everything that the country is supposed to stand for. 'Right.' A white beard and a silver Mercedes Yeah, silver. Monday morning at 11' O clock. He's an older guy with a white beard. I can dig it. - That's cool. - Okay, man. See you. Later. It was a funny thing he asked me to come back and see him I went back to see him a couple nights ago. And I looked at him. And he looked at me. And, you know, he asked me to come back to see him. So I did. But I realized that I was violating about the only rule that I've got to preserve myself in that kind of a situation. And the rule is.. ...don't try to build any kind of relationship on a lie or a fiction. Because it's not gonna work. And you can get screwed. And somebody's gonna get hurt. I don't care so much if.. ...I do. But I don't like to fuck up other people's heads. Not anymore. So I reverse the jacket and you know somebody different is gonna pick me up this time. 'Cause it's, you know, a little bit different this time. The street is twentieth century. And we are put on the wrong end of the demand. The numbers that.. ...I'm only a freak by the standards I reject. I don't feel any more separate from my family than I ever did. I feel close to them. I extended myself a little bit further I guess. But.. ...you're no different than.. ..my brother or...maybe my father.. ...or you or anybody else.

[engine roaring] [instrumental music] (Tim) 'Those are some pretty groovy pads here.' 'You know these people are makin' it, man.' 'They have a whole different approach' 'to things over here man, they are all makin' it.' 'Whole different approach, eh?' You know, they don't have 'the same standards, man. They're makin' it. Yeah, this takes a little more time. [grunting] [tires screeching] Move in your car, motherfucker. Up. [engine roaring] [tires screeching] Hold it right there, asshole! [woman screaming] Turn around! Hurt my girl and I'll break your arm. Turn around! 'Let her go, shit.' Hold still. You fuckin' asshole, leave me alone! Let her go. Bob, there's two balloons over there, grab them. - Can you hold him? - I got him. Don't move. Put her in the car. Yeah, there's two balloons up there. There's some balloons lyin' right over here.
