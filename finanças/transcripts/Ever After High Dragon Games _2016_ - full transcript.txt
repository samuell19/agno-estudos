Brooke page: The Evil Queen had taken over the school and given it one wicked makeover. (Magic whooshes) ♪♪♪ Female narrator: And the darkest chapter in Apple White's story was being written. A cursed apple from the Evil Queen had poisoned her into forever after sleep. Brooke page: And Daring Charming had just jumped out of the booking glass! Daring Charming: Now please, please - I understand it's been quite some time since you've seen this face and you must be going through withdrawal but take caution! Too much handsome at once can be a shock to the system. Sips not gulps, people. Hunter huntsman: Hey guys! (Laughing, cheering) - Yeah! We made it! - Woo-hoo! - Hunter! How did you-- - It was Jillian's beanstalk. - A few of us were able to sneak away from the school while Faybelle was out with the dragons. (Laughing, cheering) - Wow, daring let you borrow his mirror? That's a first. - This is no ordinary mirror - the booking glass. We can use it to send my mother back to the mirror realm. How did we make this thing work before? - I don't know. It just started talking and then Daring popped out. - Helloooo. Mirror lady? Start doing mirror stuff!! (Taps, fizzles) Mirrie: Passcode incorrect. - We don't have a passcode! Raven, can't you do something? - Yeah. Unlock it with magic. - In history of evil spells, Baba Yaga said the booking glass is shielded by dark fairy magic. I-I can't crack it. - We have to send that Evil Queen back to where she belongs for poisoning Apple. - Wait. Apple's been poisoned? - It's true. Forever after sleep. - This is it, Charming. You have to wake your sleeping damsel with a kiss - and it's happily ever after from here on out! Ohhhh! This is all happening so fast! How do I look? How's my hair? - Come on, drama prince - let's go save Apple. (Wings flutter) - I did it! I found Raven and her friends in the enchanted forest! I poisoned Apple White! I am on a wicked role! I am... being completely ignored! Ahem! - Faybelle. Which of these nail polish colors gives off more of a "be scared of me because I'm your evil ruler" vibe? - Did you hear what I said? I took care of everything. How about a little evil credit over here? - Need I remind you who wears the crown in this wicked takeover? None of this would be happening without my brilliant planning. Those idealistic damsels are still out there and this isn't over yet. But I've come too far not to see my ultimate plan to completion. Are you sure about this color? - You look spelltacular. (Horse whinnies, hopeful gasps) (Birds chirps) (All cheer, clap) Daring charming: Apple White, you are my damsel. And I am your Prince Charming. And now I will fulfill our destinies - and we shall live happily ever... (Kiss) after. Hm. Heh. Happily ever after. Ever after. Heh. (Kiss) - Daring? Is something wrong? - I'm-I'm not the prince of destiny. I'm not her prince charming. Cedar wood: What does this mean? - It means Apple's forever sleep - really is for ever after. We're here today to honor and spellebrate Apple White. She was a royal. She was my roommate. And she was my friend. She was kind - she was loving - and she deserved her happily ever after. I wish I was as powerful as my mother - that I had the kind of magic that could take me back to when all of this started. If I could go back, I'd tell Apple that she has a choice. We all do. We all have the power to choose our stories. And if your choice is to follow your pre-determined destiny - you have to trust that it will happen in its own time. And you don't have to make a deal with evil. Make a deal with evil... I-I have to go. (Shocked gasps, murmuring) - Where are you going? - To make sure the rest of my friends don't end up like Apple. - You're going to see your mother, aren't you? Raven, you can't! - It's the only way. I know what i'm doing. Here. You're going to need this. The booking glass? But-but we don't know how to-- Trust me. Somebody is about to have a change of heart. (Dragon roars) - (Gasp) What are you up to, Raven Queen? (Dragon squawks) - Hello, Raven. - We, need to talk. Evil Queen: Attention subjects! Your attention please! Justine Dancer: (Gasp) The Evil queen is on my mirrorphone. Farrah Goodfairy: Mine too! Evil Queen: Just thought you'd be hexcited to know that I am leaving Ever After high, and this kingdom, forever after. (Shocked gasps) Yes... that's right, your curs-ed little lives have all been spared Because, well let's just say mother's day came early this year. My daughter, Raven Queen, has agreed to join me. To become evil and take over other lands with me. (Confused murmuring) Raven joined the Evil Queen?! Raven is going to be evil?! Evil Queen: Let's see here... What land shall we take over first? We could take another crack at wonderland. Or we could conquer and rule over gingerbread land. Or-or hear me out now - the land of the giants! - Those all sound great, mom. I'll go anywhere you want. As long as it's not here. - Ah! I'm too excited to pick. My wicked little blackbird has flown home. Mother-daughter evil selfie! (Camera clicks) Faybelle: Oh my fairy godmother! I've spent all this time fluttering around, doing your evil bidding without so much as a... "hey, thanks Faybelle. Hex of a job." And now little miss... (mocking) "I'm gonna choose my own destiny" comes waltzing in and you actually believe she's going to be evil?! - Will you excuse us for a moment? That is my daughter you're talking about. (Muffled arguing) - Whatever after. I'm telling you, she is up to something. You don't honestly think she's evil now. - She's going to be just like me because I gave her no choice! All of my plotting and planning has finally gotten me what I want! Don't you understand? I won! - All of this was about Raven? But what about me? Evil Queen: What about you? Now where were we? Ooh... what about the Sea Kingdom? We could rule over the mer-folk? Ooh! We could get paddle boats! (Wings flutter) (Low hum of chatter) (Beep, plays a slow tune) - Oh yes. That's what feelings sound like. Hey what the hex? (record scratches) Can't you see I'm trying to wallow? - All this pouting - and not a good look on you. It's time to turn the page, brother. - Oh. That's easy for you to say. Don't you understand? I just lost my destiny. I'm not Apple's prince charming! - And I'm not a damsel in distress! Some of us aren't going to follow our original destinies. - Raven did. Nobody ever thought she would but look what happened. - Raven did what she had to save her friends. She had a choice to make. And so do you. - I was so sure I was Apple's prince charming. - (Sighs) If my kiss can't wake her then I don't what can. Briar: (Gasp) Apple, wake up! (Big inhale) (Gasp) (Panicked breaths) - Darling? What are you-- Breathe Apple, breathe! (Concerned gasps) (Realizing gasp) (Exhales big breath, magic whooshes) (Big breath, coughing) All: Apple's back! Darling did it! Apple is awake! What happened? Did-did Daring wake me up? - (Giggles) Wait. Where's Raven? - Uh... Apple White: Un-hex-ceptable! The Evil Queen cannot be allowed to win like this. We have to do something. - I'm sorry, Apple, but I think we're too late. - You don't understand. This is all my fault. I set the Evil Queen free. I thought keeping her secret was going to be good for Ever After high. Good for all of us. But look at all the trouble it lead to. And Raven joining sides with her mother? That's not the happily ever after she wanted. Please. Help me fight back, help me save Raven. We have dragons! We have the booking glass. We just need the passcode. - We've tried, Apple. But it's not like we can guess the combination. Daring just got lucky when he got captured. - Lucky? I wouldn't put it that way. Faybelle: I would! (Dragon squawks) (Dragon roar, landing thud) (Gasps) - Let me guess. Don't know how to unlock the booking glass? One, two, three, four... that booking glass is locked no more! (Magic whooshes) What should I capture? Hmm. How about a sandwich. (Magic whooshes) - I don't understand. Why are you switching sides? Faybelle: This dark fairy is just out for revenge. I worked my wings off for that ungrateful queen. Let's see how well her wicked plans go without Faybelle in her corner. - What are you waiting for, people? - Dragon up! - (Cheering) (Dragon roar) (Giggling) Darling Charming: "Somebody is going to have a change of heart." That's what Raven told me before she left. - What does that mean? Briar Beauty: It means that she knew Faybelle was going to get angry at the evil queen and switch sides. Ashlynn Ella: This was part of her plan all along. She's playing her mother. - And she knows that we're coming with the booking glass. Evil Queen: And we'll need some dragon tears, a little dark fairy dust... My dark robe oh and my other dark robe. Almost finished packing! Why do you keep doing that? - Doing what? - Staring ominously in to the distance. What are you looking for? - Nothing. I'm just really hexcited. About being evil and conquering the world and stuff. - Prove it. (Magic whooshes) (Gasps) Evil Queen: You're on the path to become evil now, dear. Toss Snow White and those teachers into that void. - Hmm. - Raven, please help ussss. (Magic whooshes) (Magic blasts) - (Chuckles) Nice try, birdy, but I am much more powerful than you! (Magic blasts) Ugh! (Gasps, Nevermore whimpers) (Evil Queen Cackles) I know you're just doing all this to save your little friends out there. (Nevermore roars) (Magic whoosh) (Chains clink, whimpers) Raven: Nevermore! - You may not be evil now, Raven Queen, mark my words - you will learn! (Dragon squawks, Raven gasps) (Dragon roar) Raven Queen: Apple. Apple's awake! - Yes. And it seems somebody showed her how to use the booking glass. You! You were behind this! You played on Faybelle's jealousies and tricked her into joining your friends. You manipulative little chip off the old glass slipper. It takes a truly wicked mind to concoct a scheme like that. Oh you have so potential! It's too bad I have to go destroy your friends now. Spell you later. (Dragon roar) ♪♪♪ (Dragons squawk) (Low growl) - All right, everyone, listen up. Apple has to get as close to the Evil Queen as she can let's cover her back and make sure she gets there.

Starting with you! Capture Apple! (Magic blast) Somebody's been practicing! - Agh! - Well, isn't this a fun little reunion. - It's over, mom. We're taking back the school. - You might want to think about what you're doing, Apple. You're throwing away your destiny. - Don't listen to her, Apple. Without me - you'll never get your happily ever after. Raven has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't intend to follow in my footsteps. Face it. You don't have a choice. - Yes, I do. We all have a choice. And I'll find my happily ever after some other way - without you. Capture Evil Queen! (Magic blast) Evil Queen: Noo! I'm - not - going - back! (Chuckles) I told you! I'm - more - powerful than you! - Apple! - She's weakening the booking glass! (Magic hums) (Blast) Evil Queen: Nooooo! - Agh! - Whooaa! - Whhoooooaaa! - Ahhhhhh! - Whoa!

Raven queen: Mom. Evil queen: So... what's new? - How are you holding up in there? - Oh it's not so bad, I suppose. Somebody left a sandwich in here. I'm... Royally proud of you, Raven. - Seriously? After all that? - You demonstrated that your powers are even stronger than before. And to orchestrate such a crafty scheme to take down the evil queen? The Evil Queen.
