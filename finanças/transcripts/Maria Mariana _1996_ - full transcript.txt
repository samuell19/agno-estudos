- Hi, Ana. - Hi, Zam. Where did you come from? I was at home. We're planning a trip to the city. - Anything special going on? - We're just going to hang out. You in? Sure. Let me go home and change. Okay. Wait at the usual place. Let's go! Mariana! Ana! Mariana! Wait! Ana, where are you rushing off to? Are you going to hang out with those bikers? You're so nosy. Such a busybody. Mind your own business. What is going to become of you? When will you learn? It's my life! Mariana! - Maria. - Mother. I cooked your favorite dish today. Fish cooked with hot peppers in coconut gravy. I'm sure you'll love it. Thank you, Mother. Why did you go to all the trouble to cook for me? I told you, Mother, if you want to cook, just cook on the weekends. Then I can help you. It's okay, Maria. Concentrate on your studies, that's important. Besides, you have extra classes on Saturday and Sunday. Thank you, Mother. Let's eat with your sister. The food is getting cold. There's no need, Mother. I'm full. Just go ahead and eat with Maria. I'm going out. Where are you going? The usual place. I'm meeting friends. I'm going to the city. You're always going out. You're hardly home. You should be studying. Why don't you try and be more like Maria? Mariana! Wait! Wait! Honey. You're home late today. I had a lot to do at the office. Besides, my assistant is on leave. Maria. Father. When did you get home? I just got back. Earlier today I met Corporal Yahya. He sends his regards. - Corporal Yahya? - Yes. He was your marching teacher when you were in the Police Cadets in the fifth form. Remember? Yes, peace be upon him. Maria, although you're no longer active with the school's Police Cadets, I hope you'll continue to do something good. And at the same time, take care of your sister, Mariana. Help her with her studies. Yes, Father. RESTRICTED AREA Mariana? - Mariana! - She's not in her room, honey. She's been out since this afternoon. Mariana said she was going to the city. I forbade her, but she just ignored me. Is she still causing problems? Hey! Step on it! Such a slowpoke. I'm already late! Relax. Don't worry. Stop panicking. Easy for you to say. It's already 11 p.m. You promised we'd go home early. Okay! You're like an old woman. Come on! - Bye. - Okay. Bye! Bye! - Okay, Ana. Bye. - Okay. Do you know what time it is? Sit down. I want to talk to you. Everything I do is wrong. I know! You and Mother must have spun a tale for Father. That's not true. Father himself caught you coming home late yesterday. Don't blame us. Enough! Yes, I'm the bad one. You're good, religious. Yes, the apple of Mother's eye. Mariana. What are you saying? Mother loves us both equally. You're the one being ridiculous. You shouldn't make accusations. This is not an accusation. Father loves you more too. Even though you're his stepdaughter. It's because you're good at winning his heart. You pretend to be good. Then you stab me in the back. Don't just make accusations, Mariana. You shouldn't do that. Mariana. Although we have the same mother but different fathers, don't let that drive a wedge between us. Fine, but I don't like it when you're a nosy parker. Let's just mind our own business. Okay? Ana! As an elder sister, I've a right to know what's going on. I don't think so. What's the matter with you? I don't like to be controlled. Understand! So this is what you've been up to? - I'm going to report you to the teacher. - Stop acting like you're so great! I don't care! - Hey! - What are you doing? - That hurts! - Stop struggling. Stop trying to be a teacher's pet. - What are you doing? - I can do whatever I want! - That hurts! Stop. - Serves you right. - That hurts! - Enough! What's going on here? Mariana! Why did you beat her? You're always causing problems in school. I'm sorry I had to call you, Mr. Zakaria. As the principal here, I've received numerous complaints from the discipline teacher regarding Mariana. I understand. Thanks for calling me this time. I regret what happened. Apart from the complaints I received, I also found out, Mr. Zakaria, that your daughter is friends with rowdy boys after school hours. It has to be stopped before things become more serious. I hope you understand what I mean, Mr. Zakaria. I understand, sir. Thank you for telling me. Children these days are not like kids during our time, Mr. Zakaria. They are exposed to all kinds of things. As parents, we need to keep an eye on them so they are not influenced by these unhealthy activities. Yes! It's my fault. However, Father, you shouldn't just blame me. Does anyone care how I feel? About my well-being and problems? What's wrong? Tell me. We've always cared about you. Tell me. Talk to us. Mariana, you don't seem to have problems. Same as your sister, Maria. If Maria can discipline herself and succeed in her studies, why can't you? You should follow Maria's example. I know, all this time you have been doing as you please and acting without thinking. Ana, soon you'll be sitting your exams. Focus on your studies. You should follow your sister's example. It's always Maria! I'm sick of it. You're always treating her better than you treat me. Wouldn't it be better if I hadn't been born? Ana! Honey, you should rest. You're not well. Don't worry. I'll take care of our daughter's problem. If I failed to raise her properly, I don't think you'll be able to do it, Zainab. What's worrying me now is, if it's fated that I'm no longer around, how are you going to control Mariana? You shouldn't think so far ahead. God willing, she'll change. Why are you in my room? What do you want? Ana, I want to talk to you. What else is there to talk about? My ears are about to fall off. Every day is a torture. I'll go crazy like this. Why are you like this? Our father has heart disease. If you love Father, you should listen to him. Stop it! There's just the two of us, Ana. If one hurts, the other feels it too. Enough! I don't want to hear it! Ana! Get out! SIX YEARS LATER What do you think, Susan? I hope the information we received is correct. - Are you sure it's tonight? - Yes. They should be coming through here any time now. Get ready. Yes, sir. - Maria, move out now. - Yes, sir. Maria, don't get too close. Over. Yes, sir. Hello. What? Damn it, we're being followed. Quick! Stop! Maria, hurry up! Stop! Maria, you go over there. Quick! Run! That was great, Ana! Your voice is great. Who? Me? What's the matter with you? Mariana, could you sing one more song? Please. Please. I don't earn a living singing. It's just for fun. Ana, I want to take you home tonight. So, stop giving me excuses, okay? I have my own bike. Why are you being such a pain? I know my way home. Next time, leave your bike. Just come with me. Isn't that easier? Excuse me? I don't like getting rides from people. That was fine when we were in school. You lost your chance! Go home and take a flower bath! Ouch, that hurt. It really hurts. Just go home yourself. I noticed that you seem tired. Heavy workload? It's the usual, Mother. Jobs like mine are unstable unless you work in an office like Mariana. Why did you chose a career like that? Aren't there jobs that are more suited to your qualifications? Mother, I told you before, I'm interested in challenging jobs. Besides, I have my Police Cadet experience from when I was in school. If your father was still alive, he would have been proud of your achievements. I'm just worried about one thing. Your sister, Mariana. Isn't she working, Mother? It's 9 a.m. and she's still asleep. Mariana! Mariana! Mariana! Mariana, open the door! Mariana! Mariana! What's with all the noise so early in the morning? I want to sleep. Aren't you going to work? It's already 9 a.m. - What? 9 a.m.? - Yes. Why didn't you wake me up earlier? Mother, you're hopeless. What's the matter with you? As a public relations officer, where is your sense of responsibility? Since you started working six months ago, your attendance record has been bad. You're always late, always on sick leave, and all kinds of rubbish. Mariana! Do you want to work or fool around? I'm sorry, Mr. Ali. I didn't do it on purpose, I just... Just what? You obviously place more importance on your social life. You spend every night at clubs. Only going home at dawn. Do you think I don't know? Mr. Ali, that is my personal life. Mr. Ali, you've no right to know. I do not want to know. However, this involves your work. If you can't accept being reprimanded, set up your own company, be your own boss. Right? Mr. Ali, do not look down on me. I'm not looking down on you. People like you need to be reminded, understand? Perhaps your parents spoiled you. That is why you're like this. I'm quitting as of today. Very well. The two criminals shot yesterday were part of a triad. They were recently involved in several robberies and murders. Looks like they were distributing counterfeit money, sir. RM 500,000 was found in their car. Too bad. If only we had caught them alive, we would have been able to track down the rest. We need to continue with the surveillance and gather info on them. I'll use whatever means I can to track them, sir. Even though I know this is a dangerous job. Maria, Susan. The bosses want us to destroy this group for good. Our losses were big. All because of your stupidity. I told you so many times, we must be careful. I did my job as ordered. I don't understand how they knew about our plans. That's not an excuse, Robert. We've lost two important people. What about our new job? What should we do? Everything has been arranged. Just wait for my orders. Remember, Robert. You're my brother, but do not repeat this mistake again. Including this one, you've changed jobs six times. You need to stop all this. You'll be on the losing side in the end. Stop worrying, Mother. I'm not a child anymore. Mariana. I just don't want you to waste your youth. If you don't prepare now, you'll be left behind. I know how to arrange my life, Mother. Maria and I are not the same. Let us get on with things in our own way. Mariana, Maria is your sister. At the very least, you should follow her example, her achievements. Enough, Mother. From when Father was alive till now, you've always praised Maria. What? Am I that terrible? - Sergeant, watch my back. - Yes. Come on. You failed. They should have been arrested. - Why? - We apologize, sir. We did our best, but luck wasn't on our side, sir. That's not an excuse. You knew that man is important in his group. If he had been arrested, it would have helped our investigation. Now what are we going do? We had to consider the safety of the civilians, sir. Use your head. In the force, particularly in a special unit like ours, everyone has to be efficient and quick on their feet. You were assigned to this unit based on your deftness. You need to prove it. Ready. Stop! Pull over! Stop! Pull over! Push your bikes to the station. Move it! Come on! What is going to become of you all? Hello. Is this Miss Maria? Yes, speaking. So sorry to bother you in the middle of the night like this. Who is this? I'm Sergeant Ismail, 116510, from Bandar Street Traffic Police. Your sister, Mariana binti Zakaria, is here at the station. The station? Why? She was arrested for illegal racing, miss. Very well. I'm on my way now. Thank you. Why are you doing all this? What are you trying to prove? Don't you have anything better to do? Don't you care about your life? You're not a kid anymore. You should know the consequences. What am I going to do now? A police inspector's sister is involved in illegal racing. You've always caused trouble, even when Father was alive. What is going to happen to you? Mariana, wait! Mariana! You're willing to do anything as long as you can do as you please. Just as long as you get what you want. What did you get? Remember, we're no longer in school. Time flies. If you don't start planning now, you're going to be left behind. Enough! It's not up to you to decide my future. Get off your high horse! Do you think you're really successful now? Ana, there's just the two of us. I don't want you to be a failure in life. I haven't failed yet. Since way back, I've never liked my life being decided by you or Mother. If you and Mother are disappointed in me... Hi, Ray! Hi! - Hello, everyone! - New bike? No, it's a friend's. My bike was impounded by the police. Why did you race? That's just looking for trouble. Mariana's bike was impounded as well. Yes, poor thing. Come on, I didn't ask her to come. She was eager to join us. It's okay though. You two are together, right? Hey! What are you talking about? There's nothing between us. We're just friends. Even though you're friends, aren't you attracted to her? She's not bad looking. Great body too. Don't tell me you're not tempted. Ray, you haven't even had a taste? You might regret it. If you're scared, let me have a go. You're such an embarrassment. You've known her for so long and yet nothing happened? Really, Ray, you're such an embarrassment. What kind of a man are you? Don't think so much about that sister of yours. It might affect your performance. Besides, your mother is there. My mother has been so depressed since our father passed away. She sacrificed so much to educate the two of us. I need to shoulder the family responsibilities if possible. What about your personal life? Doesn't that get affected? There's no special someone? I don't have time to think about all that. Especially now. As long as our case isn't solved, I won't get a good night's sleep. You should know what Mr. Anuar is like. Maria, don't tell me you took it to heart when he told you off. Ray, where are you taking me? Just come along. You're such a pain. Okay, we've arrived at this empty warehouse. Ray, what's going on? Why did you bring me here? Actually, I've a surprise for you. A surprise? It's a secret. What are you really up to? Stop it, Ray. I'll scream. You want to scream? Go ahead and scream, Mariana. There's no one here. There's only you and me. Ray, don't you dare touch me. I've been waiting forever for a moment like this, Mariana. To be alone with you. All this time, everyone has dared me to do it. They said I wouldn't be able to get you. To me, however, you're just a lamb. Easy to approach but not to win over. Takes food from the hand, and once caught, you run away. Enough! Don't try anything I don't like if you want to remain friends. Stop pretending to be so innocent. Do you think I don't know your history? You're not pure, right? You almost became a slut. Ray, you animal. You're taking advantage of our friendship. Ray! Ray, don't! Let me go! Let me go! Where are you going to run to? Let me go! Let me go! I'm Jeffry. Mariana. Whether you realize it or not, I've been watching and following you. I know. Why are you doing that? I like you. You like me? I'm not as pretty as other girls. Maybe you have the same intentions as Ray. You're both men, right? Each man has a different point of view. The same goes for me. You're special in your own way. You're different from the others. But... - But what? - Nothing. Go on. I'm all ears, even though it may be something I don't want to hear. Your attitude and your ways. Your life has no direction. You're too wild. You can't just make accusations like that. What I do is just to blow off steam. I also de-stress by riding bikes. Sometimes I go to clubs, but there have to be limits. You think that women should just give in? Become stupid? Just stay home? Remember. You're a woman, don't go overboard. We're from the East, Mariana. We practice moderation... in what we do. Your attitude and your ways. Your life has no direction. You're too wild. We're from the East, Mariana. We practice moderation in what we do. Ana, there's a job vacancy at my friend's office. If you're interested, I can help you. What job is it? Production assistant manager for an advertising company. Sure, but is there a chance I'll get it? God willing. Call Mr. Jusoh. This is his card. Thank you, Maria. Maria. I know. This is about your bike, right? Maria, please help me get my bike back. Talk to Inspector Abu at the station. Solve your own problems. I don't want my position to be used for personal reasons. Understand? Use this money to pay for the compound. You can spend the rest, okay? I'm going, Mother. Ana, I'm going to work. Ana. Don't create problems like before, okay? Don't tarnish your sister's good name. You know, Jef. Yesterday I solved two things. One, I found a new job. Two, I got back my beloved motorcycle. If you want to know, both were done with my big sister's help. You've an older sister? Yes. Her name is Maria. We've different fathers but share the same mother. She works as a police inspector at the crime branch. Wow! I never thought you'd be the younger sister of a police inspector. Why? Does that make you uncomfortable to be friends with me, because I'm the little sister of a police inspector? Not because it's uncomfortable. I'm just afraid I'll end up in jail. You're being ridiculous. What have you been wishing for? Everyone needs happiness in this life. The same goes for me, Jef. If possible, I want to forget everything in the past. You know, Jef. I've always dreamed one day, Prince Charming will come and save me from the jaws of a crocodile or a dragon. Afterwards, he will fall in love with me. And then? Then, we'll have a grand wedding and live happy ever after. What do you think? Isn't my dream wonderful? Not bad. I'll give you a B plus. What do you think? Just a B plus? I thought I'd get an A. You're making it hard for me to tell my story. Ana. Where are you going so early in the morning? I'm going to work, Mother. Going to work? Mother, today is Friday. Yes but how are you going to ride your bike dressed like this? I'll get a cab. Okay, Mother. I'm going to work. Still up, Maria? I'll go to bed in a while, Mother. I want to finish this book. I've a promotion interview next month. Really? I pray that you'll succeed. Maria. - Yes, Mother? - Did you notice something? I noticed changes in your sister, Mariana. I know, Mother. That is what I've been hoping for. From the time you were at school until now when you've become adults, I've noticed that you are both different. You know that, right? Your late father fell sick, and it was all because of Mariana's behavior. Let's put the past behind us, Mother. We can't look back. Where's Mariana? She's in her room. Is that you, Mother? Come in. Ana. Maria. Who are you writing to? Who are you writing a letter to? To a friend. I'm sure it's for a guy. Do you mind if I take a look? - I don't think so, Maria. - Let me take a look. It's embarrassing. Let me see. Jeffry? Who is he? Your boyfriend? No. He's just a friend. - Just a friend? - Yes. I don't believe it. Don't try and hide it from me. You do know what my job is, Ana? Sooner or later, I'll find out. You better tell me the truth. Okay. His full name is Jeffry bin Osman. He works as an officer in a private company. And? His family is rich. He lives in Bukit Damansara. And? His hobby is the same as mine. Riding motorcycles. And? You're such a pain, Maria. You're interrogating me like I'm guilty. Just because you're the police. I'm just curious. I'm not angry. Come on, have an open mind. Okay. To satisfy you, why don't I introduce you to Jeffry? What do you think? Jef, why don't talk with Maria? I want to buy something from the shopping center. Maria, I'm going, okay? Don't take too long, Ana. I can't stay long either. Okay. I've heard a lot about you from Mariana, Miss Maria. You don't have to be formal with me. Jeffry, I would like to thank you for succeeding in changing my sister. She has changed a lot. My mother and I are so happy. I'm proud that I'm able to meet you, Maria. I never thought that Mariana had such a beautiful sister and so courteous. I think those compliments are too much. It's a fact, Maria. Credit where credit is due. Jeffry, I want to ask you something. I hope to get an honest answer from you. Sure. Okay. I'll be there in an hour. Yes. I'm sorry, Jeffry. Please excuse me. It's important. We'll meet again, okay? Freeze! Police! What? Robert was arrested? When? Where? Robert has been arrested by the police. He never follows my orders. How are we going to proceed? The printing block is with him. I know. We'll amend our plans in the next 24 hours. Tony, I'm worried if... I want to know who the mastermind behind your gang's activities is. Talk! I don't know! It's better if you cooperate, Robert. You don't have a choice. There's no use shielding your friends. They must think that you've betrayed them. If you get out, you're going to be killed. Such a waste. I'm just the errand boy. Nothing more than that. Impossible! We know you're someone important in your gang. Hey! Cat got your tongue? You're still being loyal to your boss? Talk! How many times must I tell you? I don't know! I don't know! I'm really impressed with you, Jeffry. You managed to tame such a wild bird. What do you mean? Mariana. Who are you to her? - Lover? Wife? - That's not the question. Stay away from Mariana. She's not the one for you. What if I told you that she's mine? You don't have rights over her. You still don't know Mariana, Jeffry. She's slept with many men. Including me. Don't try to slander her. You were trying to rape her that night. Wow! It's obvious that you love her. I'm not forcing you to believe me. I'm just surprised. A man as good looking as you, and you're willing to settle for leftovers. If you want the truth, why don't you ask Mariana yourself? Yes, it's true. I'm no longer pure, Jef. But it was against my will. The incident happened five years ago. It was after I finished my studies. I was too young to know men at the time. I was fooled by promises made by a man I thought was a faithful lover. It turns out he was just fooling around with me. Where is that man now? He should be held responsible. He's no longer in this world. What do you mean? He died in a road accident. Maybe that was God's punishment for what he did to me. Since that terrible incident, I no longer trust men. That is, until you appeared in my life. Why didn't you tell me from the start? I didn't mean to hide it from you. However, the situation didn't allow me to tell you. I realized that it would come up in the end. I'm sorry, Jef. It's not your fault, Mariana. I sympathize about what happened to you. It happens a lot to youngsters these days. Maybe the situation is what made you like this. Except... I know. I'm not good enough for a place in your heart. You're a good man, Jef. A man like you should meet a girl who is pure. Not like me, who is hampered by sins from the past. Everyone has their own dark history. Don't regret it, Mariana. The main thing is for you to stand up and build a new life from the ruined one. Looks like Robert is still refusing to talk. He's a tough one. Yes, but there must be a way to get him to talk, Susan. How long can he hold out? Yes. Who is this? I was wondering who it was. What's up? You want to see me? Yes. Where? Very well. Okay. Bye. Who was that? Your boyfriend? Jeffry. Mariana's boyfriend. What does he want? I don't know. He says it's important. What is it, I wonder? He's never called me. Please forgive me for troubling you, Maria. I want to thank you for agreeing to see me. Actually... Cat got your tongue? Tell me. What is it that's so important? I wanted to talk about Mariana. I knew it. What is it? Are you having problems with her? Jeffry. You're a man. If it's a small matter, you don't have to tell me about it. You need to be patient with Mariana's attitude. She's rather wild. I appreciate your success in changing her. However, don't expect the changes to be so drastic. I understand that, Maria, but... Jeffry, you may not know this, but Mother and I failed to change Mariana's ways and attitude. Your presence in her life has indirectly brought us closer as a family. I'm surprised to see as handsome a man as you willing to settle for someone else's leftovers. Someone else's leftovers... Jeffry, your presence in her life has indirectly brought us closer as a family. What are you doing, Maria? I'm just getting some fresh air. Maria. I want to ask your opinion. What about? What do you think about Jeffry? Ana. Every woman dreams of a good looking, tall, and good man. And, if possible, a well-to-do man. Jeffry falls into that category. I don't know. Men are hard to predict. Actually, I can't say more than that. It's still early... Are the two of you serious? What if we are serious? What do you think? What's most important is honesty. Ana, do you really trust him? I don't know, Maria. Since Jeffry came into my life, I don't know, all of a sudden I have these feelings. Feelings that I've never had before. Jeffry's presence brings such happiness. Maria, Jeffry told me that his family is coming over to inquire. Inquire? His family knows about the two of you? They know, Maria. In that case, I'll inform Mother. I'm sure Mother will be thrilled to learn this news. Ana, I hope you'll face the future with confidence. Yes. I'm representing the gentleman's family. We're here today to inquire on the flower that is prospering in your home, Mrs. Zainab. Looks like our boy really has his eyes set on the flower in this home. As the representative for the girl's family, we do not mind if that is what the gentleman's family wants. In fact, we're delighted. As the Malay saying goes, we would be so honored and proud. However, there are two flowers in this house. Which one has the lad chosen? In that case, we'll be direct. There's no need to beat around the bush. What's the phrase in English? Very well. Mrs. Zainab, the lad has chosen your daughter whose name is Maria. - Maria? - Yes, Maria. Your eldest girl, Mrs. Zainab. There must be some mistake. No, this is Jeffry's choice. How can this be? As far as I know, Jeffry's choice is Mariana. Why is Jeffry doing this? Maria? I'm in the dark as well. Calm down. Actually, Jeffry changed his mind at the last minute. As a mother, I have to go along with what my son wants. Mother. What is going on, Mother? Mariana! You've destroyed the relationship between my sister and I. You've broken Mariana's heart. Now you want me to be her replacement? What is going on, Jef? Do you think this is all a joke? I never meant it that way, Maria. Everything that happened, I never planned it. Please believe me. You broke her heart, Jef. My opinion towards you was wrong. Please don't misunderstand. Let me be frank. All this time, I tried to love Mariana. I just couldn't. You couldn't? All this time, you took my sister everywhere. You lifted her spirits, gave her hope. Now you're denying it. I'm not denying it. However this is a matter of the heart and feelings. I can't lie to myself, Maria. Since the first time I met you, I was attracted to you. Day after day, the feelings continued to grow. I called you to tell you the truth, but I couldn't tell you. I realize this decision is crazy. It is crazy, Jef. You've destroyed her trust completely. Let me explain it to Mariana. Don't add insult to injury. I would never take my sister's happiness away from her. Now, I want you to find her. Don't even dream I'll accept your proposal. Mariana. Why are you here so early? Rozi, can I come in? Come in. What's wrong? You look troubled. Rozi, do you mind if I stay here? Mother, don't worry. I'll find Mariana and bring her home. I'm worried she'll go back to her old ways. I'm afraid she'll be even worse, Maria. What's going to happen? Please don't think the worst, Mother. God willing, I'll try to solve her problem. Trust me, Mother. I don't agree with what you're doing. Don't go back to your old ways. Who are you to stop me? You're just a man with no principles. Please don't do this, Mariana. I don't like it. Mariana, wait! I don't want you to go back to your old ways. Don't torture yourself. Why? I'm not your wife or lover. - Why do you care? - Mariana, you've changed. Who has changed? Me or you? Tell me! You treated me like a toy. You pretended to be kind. Honest, sincere. It was a lie! All this time, I thought you were such an honest man. The truth is, you were quietly carrying on with my own sister. That's not true, Mariana. Don't make baseless accusations. I know I'm not as pretty as Maria, Jef. I'm lacking in everything. That is why I'm always left behind. Mariana. I'm the one in the wrong. Maria has nothing to do with it. Don't try and defend her, Jef. She has always been snatching my happiness from me. Fine, I'll give in. If that is what she wants. It's better if you just kill me. Only then will you be satisfied! I told you, I don't know anything! - Sergeant! - Yes, ma'am. Take him to the lockup. What do we do now, Maria? I won't be satisfied as long as he remains stubborn. We can get a court order to extend his remand period. We can't leave Robert in the lockup any longer. It's dangerous. I'm worried... he might cave in. If that happens, our entire organization will be destroyed. That true, Tony. He knows all the gang's secrets. We must do something. How did you know I was here? That's not important, Ana. What's important is that you must come home. No. I'm never going back again. Let me lead my own life. Don't be like this, Ana. Mother misses you and is waiting for you. Why is she waiting for me? You're there, right? You're Mother's favorite, right? You were our late father's favorite. That is why you've always had whatever you wanted. Please don't get it wrong, Ana. I love you. Love? An older sister who stole her own sister's lover? Ana! Go! Get out of here! I hate you! You're no longer my sister. Leave! Leave! - Shut up! - Let me go! Good evening, Miss Maria. Perhaps you don't know who I am, Miss Maria. That is not important. It's enough that I know you, Miss Maria. Who are you? What do you want? Patience, Miss Maria. Listen to this voice carefully. Maria. Maria. Help me, Maria. I'm sure you know that voice, right, Miss Maria? Listen, Miss Maria. If you want your sister to be safe, it's easy. There are only two conditions you need to follow. Conditions? What do you mean? First condition, release Robert. Second, drop the charges against him. Easy, right? Don't you dare try to threaten me. I don't have the authority to do all that. That is your problem. I'm giving you 48 hours starting now. If my requests are not met, or if you try anything dumb, you'll see your sister as a dead body. Think about it. For the next instructions, wait for my call at noon tomorrow. At your house. Talk! You better come clean with me before I lose my patience. You're not going to talk? Who is your leader? Hey! I want an answer now. Talk! Who is your leader? Talk! - Talk! - Maria! You can do whatever you want. Don't expect to get any information from me. I'd rather die! Don't tempt me. Hey! Listen. I'm not scared of your threats! I won't stop until I get what I want. Now, you better start talking. Talk! - Stop being stubborn. Talk! - Maria! Talk! Maria! Are you having problems? Don't worry, Mother. I promise, I'll save Mariana today. In any way I possibly can. After that, we'll have dinner together. We'll celebrate your birthday. Okay, Mother? Mother. Could you please cook our favorite dish? Please, Mother? I want all of us to have dinner together with Mariana. Maria. Good. Right on time, Miss Maria. I'm sure you have been waiting for my call, right? Just as promised. What about my conditions? Do you agree? I agree. Listen carefully. Tonight at midnight, you'll bring Robert in a car driven by yourself. Head towards Ledang Road. I'll call your cell phone. But remember... Don't try anything. Our people are constantly watching you. See you later. Inspector Maria only has 12 hours left. Move her sister to the other location, and be careful. Are you sure they'll comply with our demands? Of course. We have very valuable bait. Hey! What are you going to do to me? Listen! Your fate will be decided by your sister. If she's stubborn, you're going to get it. Hello. Good, Miss Maria. You followed orders. How is Robert? I want to talk to him now. Just a minute. It's just the two of us in the car. Very well. Yes. Just drive. I'll show you the place. You're really daring for being willing to come here. It's obvious, you really love your sister, right? I'm just complying with the deal. Now, I want you to release my sister. Where is she? Not so fast. I want you to release Robert first. No! This exchange is between my sister and Robert. Weren't those your conditions? Get down! Go downstairs, hurry up. - Quick. - Let me go! - Hurry up. - Let me go. - Let me go! - Go downstairs! Maria! Let me go! Don't believe them, Maria! They're lying! Quiet! Ana! Release Robert! I'll only release Robert if Mariana is here with me. Do you think you're smart? You're in my territory. You're surrounded. You're really dumb. So willing to come here. Look behind you. Maria! Shut up! Maria! Drop your gun. Release Robert. Kill her! Maria! Go upstairs, move it! - Maria! - Hurry up! Mariana! Let me go! Maria, be careful! Move it! - Let me go! - Robert, let's split up. Hurry up. Let me go! - Let me go! - Move it. Go! Hurry up! Let me go. Hurry up! Move it! Let's split up. - Cover me. - Okay. Maria! - Hurry up! - Maria! Quiet! Hurry up! Don't come any closer! Let me go! Quiet! Or I'll shoot you. Let her go. Don't come any closer! Let her go! Maria! Stop or I'll kill her. You're going to die. Maria! Maria! Maria! Maria. Maria! Call an ambulance! Maria. Ana. Tell Mother that I'm sorry... I couldn't make it to dinner with everyone tonight. Maria! Send birthday wishes to Mother. Maria. Ana. Please believe me. No sister would want to see her own sister's ruin. Believe me, I'm not that cruel. My only regret is... why didn't love last between us? I did everything I could, Mariana, but we kept drifting apart. Drifting further apart. I don't understand why. Maybe it's my fault. Please forgive me, Mariana. No, Maria. It's my fault. It's my fault, Maria. Maria... Subtitle translation by: Kanita Bahadun
