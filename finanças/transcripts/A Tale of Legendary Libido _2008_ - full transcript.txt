Get her something to drink. Byun? Hey! Help! Please, help! Anyone there? Help! Thanks. When will an old flower bloom? You're strong but weak down there. It looks fine outside but inside is a lonely soul nice. - Do you drink? - Not anymore. Alcohol's good for an impotent. It's too bad. An impotent? What're you talking about? Your brother has a birthmark by his belly button? And you have one on your thigh? It's the dried squid. Triviality was root of the problem. I can tell. Do you know why the totem pole is missing a nose? You saved my life. I should repay you. Listen carefully. Go to the village shrine. Face the totem pole. 2 steps back, 2 to the left 2 steps forward, and 2 to the right. You'll be where you started. Dig the ground and you'll find a bottle. Drink the potion inside. Then you'll bloom like no other. It'll fix your impotency. After you wake up no intercourse is allowed for 15 days. It should be exactly 15 days from the moment you wake up. If you're to have intercourse you'll lose everything. I can be a real man? You got it! But remember one thing. Drink only one sip. One sip? Don't go overboard. Your fortune can turn into the village's misery. Don't drink more than a sip. Don't get greedy. If you do, the village will suffer a great deal. Understood? Understood? He's gone. Hey! Hey! Did you get the whole thing? I have a bad feeling about this. This is not good. Not good at all... Stop there, you bastard! You've been hiding here to evade the draft? Stop it. I know this guy. You know him? Byun, where have you been? I thought you left the village. What do you mean? Don't you know war has broken out? Every man has been drafted. So has your brother. He finished his duty last year. He went to war on behalf of you. He asked the army to be drafted instead. Because they take one man from each household. Go on. You're lucky to have him for your brother. Wait up! What a brother you have! Here. Would you like some...? An old flower will bloom. You will be in full bloom. It'll fix your impotency. What's this smell? A fire? It's a wildfire! I gotta pee. I want to pee You're byun, aren't you? I'm not byun. He put out the fire? I can't believe it. He's impotent, right? Are you sure? It can't be him. Yeah, I heard his thing was 3 inches long. But you haven't seen it. I heard it was 5. 5 inches? It's only half the size of this. He couldn't have put out the fire with it. There goes the madam. Hey there! What is it now? Come here. You saw it, didn't you? Is it 4 or 5 inches? Byun's thing? Yes didn't you say it was 57? Yes, it's 5. That's only the head. No way! Why's he doing that at night? Just wait. He'll shower afterwards. - They're on the ground. - What? Both of his feet! Feet... How's that possible? If it's not his feet, then... Two. I need drinks!

Taste good if you share - hold him up! - Easy! Stay still! I'm too lonely I can't live without men he's still living in the past? It shouldn't be wasted. Life of a widow only wounds from cilice no feast for us, poor widows why doesn't let the snake out of his pants? Hungry for it, longing for it so lonely without men I can't live alone I can't live without men knock it off. How can you girls sing? I don't get it. Why'd he turn us down? It must be lack of confidence. Sit up! Why'd you bring a baby? It's distracting. We were seducing him in the broad daylight. We need to get him in the mood. An erotic mood! See? Erotic but not gaudy. I'll pave the way for you all tonight. You ladies owe me a favor. You broke into my place? Wasting my candles... I got rare wine. I want you to taste it. Why'd you stop coming to my bar? Low on dough? I quit drinking life is no fun without liquor for a real man. I know you like to drink. Got a girl? That's right. Drink up. It'll make you stronger. What? Playing dumb with me? I've seen it. Seen what? - The field is so hot but... - But what? There's no man to cool it down. You know what? Can you water it for me? Let me tell you. You can't handle me. You know how to bluff, huh? I've ridden more men than the hair on your head. You don't get it. If I'm a hawk, you're a meager sparrow don't worry about me. I can go on for days. What are you doing? I'm sure you know. - Move. - Where are you going? Come on, move! I must be nuts. My ass... Mom, what does this mean? Why aren't you in bed? Study tomorrow. Go to bed now, okay? - What the... - Don't you ever sleep? What's up with them? Stop pushing! What's going on? What the... You weren't bluffing after all that's right. Are you sick? Your nose is bleeding! God, this is embarrassing. I'll need a good 10 days to recover... 10 days? It was that good? Wasn't it because you hadn't had any for a while? You're so negative. What happened was... Where am I? Listen, byun. I'm happy now. Three times are enough. Or was it more? Don't give me that look! Byun... enough is enough hey! Please spare me. I've had enough for tonight. Wait... listen! Fine, let's get it over with. Come. I thought it was over but he kept on going. He was breaking me into pieces. God, my back... Go on, go line up. My nose won't stop bleeding. No cutting in! What a rude line up, girls! What's this! What are you doing?! Oh god, help! The rumor was wrong. What? It's only half of the truth. What is it this time? What's wrong with you? What the hell did you see? - A body, the wildfire... - What? A waterfall - a waterfall? This big! That big? Pants, weapon... I saw this body, and there was a fire. I saw a blazing fire from inside the carriage. I was so scared. And this waterfall... It was huge! That huge! That's how it happened what? It's really this long? Yes. I must summon him right away! Byun, give me a rice cake. I'm not selling any today. You know what I mean. I'm your big fan now. Sorry? It's the biggest penis I've ever seen. Consider your tab paid. Look, byun. I love you. Pardon? I said I love you. That's not love! Then what is? Can you teach me? Byun, where are you going? - See you tonight! - Come, byun! What do we do now without him? I'm the minister of foreign affairs. Westerners in the country are giving us a headache. I have a big plan. We're going to have a bout of the century. If you win, I'll send your brother home so do your best. Korean representative, step forward! Western representative, step forward! The challenge is how many weights you can hold. Please remove your underwear! Begin! One! Two! Three! Total amount, 3! Please remove your underwear! Begin! One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight! Nine... ten! Eleven! Play the music! Don't worry. You'll hear from him soon We're too late. Mom! The mountains are rugged the forest is chaotic mountains are everywhere the wind blowing so hard... Where's byun? He's back, right? What's wrong? Someone died, or what? Yes, someone did die. Kang-mok is dead. Are you serious? They couldn't find his body. How tragic! That's why he locked himself in. God! Let's get out of here. We're making things worse. Anyway... why is it so dry these days? She's got resentment. Fever comes from it. She doesn't need socks in the winter she needs water to cool her body down. She likes bathing in the pond. But she can't do that anymore because of drought her fever gets worse at night. So she sleepwalks around to find water at night. She will end up either killing herself... Or die from fever. Or dance around like a lunatic... And finally die from fever. It's really bad. Is there a cure? No. There's one but it doesn't require money it takes a body. One with strong Yang. A body? The art of medicine is the way of humanity it's not easy for me to say, but you must sleep with her to cure her. I'm just saying it as a doctor. What? I can't force you to have sex with her, get it? But you must sleep with her to cure her if not, she won't be around much longer. It's okay. It's okay. It's possible to use medicine but it may take 10, 20 years. Bodily sickness should treated with another body. Your brother's dead, right? Husband, have some. You're really my husband now. Looks good. It looks better on you. Yeah? Ok, let's wrap it up. The leaves are withered because of drought can't even wash because there is no water. How's byun doing? He's like a dead man without his brother worried about him? Or too horny? I'm not inconsiderate. Don't you feel sorry for him? No way. He's having fun with his sister-in-law that's enough. Honestly, I miss him terribly. If I hadn't slept with him it wouldn't be this bad. Are you pregnant? You're in big trouble! What the... No, I am not! What's that? Good heavens! What's wrong? Not satisfied? Let's do it again then. Don't overdo it for your sake. What are you talking about? I can do it all night. Come here. I missed you so much in the battlefield! Honey How odd! If the drought continues the village will be destroyed. Grudge of a spinster has caused the drought. It's an ominous sound of a female. The sound of loneliness... What should we do? Is that from lady bear? Yin wants Yang. We must send her a man full of Yang. You mean a man and a bear... That bear is god of this village. It's a holy sacrifice to god! But that's unthinkable in confucianism. Nonsense! You want the village dry up to destruction? But who's gonna volunteer? Fornicate with a bear? There's a way. Do you remember that wooden nose's drink? It's not here, sir. I found it! But it's open. Let me see. Give it here. How could it be? Who dared to drink Yang? You've been at it since the day before. Who is it? Who'd you fool around with? While we were gone byun was the only man here. She wouldn't have cheated on you if you had satisfied her in bed! - Am I right? - Of course. No, it's not what you think. It's a nightmare! I told him to drink one sip. A disaster has befallen on this village! Take byun in! He caused this drought! He drank Yang! We'll offer him to bear! Byun! You're in trouble! Come here. Darling! What's worse is that your brother... Byun! Byun! Your brother's back! Byun! Byun byun Byun, I'm back. Where did he go? I got a dried squid for him. Byun! Byun? It's good news. What is? She's pregnant. She has a bun in the oven. Our baby in my belly... It's also bad news. Drought will cause fever and kill her. If it doesn't rain soon... Fever will kill her and the baby. It will get them both. Hey, where are you going? Running away? I can't believe they're sacrificing you. Leave the village before they offer you to a bear. Run now! What are you doing? Run! It's byun! Get him! I had no one else to turn to. Water... Not even a single drop of water to drink mom... mom... I'm not your mom. What a life, poor thing... Get something to drink. We don't have any to spare for this lunatic. Don't be ridiculous! Shame on you! All you care about is sex. Do you know what loneliness is? Too much loneliness makes a person crazy get something for her! Coming! Aren't you glad I'm back in one piece? Sure, we are. We're so glad. - What's wrong with her? - That's... Where did byun go when his wife is so sick? Darling, how was the wedding? What! Her and byun? You mean, they didn't get married yet? Before I got drafted I told her to marry him. I called him my husband but he didn't believe me. He's your husband and he didn't believe you? Then byun and darling are a couple? You have to have a ceremony to make it official. But I have a baby. Really? Where is he anyway? Don't let anybody go past that line. Especially promiscuous women! He's not fighting it. I didn't tell him about the bear. It's over byun is surely dead chief! Byun byun get ready to leave the village. Think of darling and the baby. You have to take care of them now. Darling, she is... Is she crazy? What are you doing? Get her out of here! Shame on you! Stop it! A person is dying. What's up with the line? Man, woman... what's the use? I have a baby. Poor thing... What are you doing? Don't give up now! We can't go down like this! Let's pray to god once for all. Is she going nuts? Playing with hat drum? Is that all you got? If you're gonna do it, do it right! She's at it again. Gods of heaven and earth Please, hear our song Grant my husband a sweet dream tonight Gods of heaven and earth please, hear our song bless this dry land with rain and dew Grant my husband a sweet dream tonight Gods of heaven and earth please, hear our song bless this dry land with rain and dew Grant my husband a sweet dream tonight People saved themselves. My husband is alive. He's alive. He's alive Where did they all go? Geumdong! - Eundong! - Ginam! Youngjin! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! What girl wouldn't know about byun? I hear his thing is so thick. As thick as a man's body! - It's quite embarrassing, but... - What is it? I heard he had sex with a bear!
