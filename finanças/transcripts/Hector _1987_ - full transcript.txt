-Get back. Get back. -I was first. -Get back. -I was first. Donhet push. Get back. Matheussen will leave first. No, wait till I give the signal. -Ghijsels, seven seconds after him. -Seven? Seven, yes. Come on, get back. Get off the road. -Have you still got some dextrose? -Yes, Dad. -Keep warm! -Yeah. -You know what to do, pace yourself. -Yeah, Dad. Ride at your own speed. You're ready for them. -You're the best. -I know, I know. -Think of the prize. -I'm thinking of nothing else. -And don't let them rattle you. -Calm down. Matheussen, we're in the middle of the race. Want me to disqualify him? Keep it up! Come on. Move. Move. Pay attention. The race will be restarted in fifteen seconds. -Who won before? -Swa. -And who won today? -Swa. Guido, give all these people a drink on me. -Dad. -Yes? -Cheers. -Cheers. There, a cold ice cream for a hot girl. -What's that? -My stockings. -Your stockings? -I took them off. They made me itch. Give here. FINISH A. MATHEUSSEN BAKER AND CONFECTIONER Look, your husband. The palm? Swa won. -Well, Ghijsels, congratulations. -Achiel. On that son of yours. -What about you? -Seventeenth. -Seventeenth? How did that happen? -I was in front until the roundabout. Yeah, excuses, excuses. It's always something. -You should train harder. -You should eat more dextrose. -Your film plans have come to nothing? -No. I phoned a producer. I don't stand a chance. -Were the others better? -I was too beautiful for the role. -Not possible. -No. I don't know. They're going to write to me. Fantastic. -Grégoire. -Ella. I can feel a pair of baker 's eyes on the back of my neck. I've got something for that. Fantastic day. Lost the race, buggered up the van. Go to the garage tomorrow and ask whether they'll lend you a car. If only you'd forget about the cycling. I suppose I have to take up acting, like you. With that idiot Ghijsels. At least it's culture. The only thing that is in this godforsaken hole. -He's too lazy to train. -Too lazy? Jos is too lazy? He works himself to death in the bakery. Isnhet the lad allowed to have any sleep? He can sleep when he retires. -I had to work and train. -And you never won. -Exactly. -Take someone on to help you. Wouldnhet be a bad thing for your health, either. And what am I supposed to pay him with? Danish pastries? I've told you a hundred times, Hector wouldnhet cost you a thing. -Who? -Hector, my great-nephew. That abortion gone wrong? No way. -He'd love to come. -I'm sure he would. We'll invite him for a holiday and let him work all day. Jos can train, you've got some help and I've got time for rehearsals. And when we don't need him anymore, we can throw him out. No, no way. Not that nutcase! -Want to know how the fairy tale ends? -Yes, yes. You have to pay first. -Pay first. -Come on! And so... The monk came closer and closer and closer and closer and closer... -Is this the only car you could get? -I know, I know. And closer and closer and closer and closer... Hector! What a pigsty in here! Come on. Name: hector. Weight: 4 kg. Length: 37 cm. Brought in as an orphan on 7th June 1952 for a smallpox inoculation. And his mother never came to pick him up again. You are the first one from the family to contact us, you know. We're so ashamed that it has taken so long, but we are now able to take good care of him. Aren het we, schatje? Definitely. We appreciate it very much that he can come to you for a holiday. But I'm not sure it's a good idea to remove him from familiar surroundings after all this time. He's been here a long time, you see. Come in. There he is, our Hector. I've got a surprise for you. -This lady is your aunt. Aunt... -Ella. -Exactly. -Hello. Hello, Hector. Aren het you a big boy! And that gentleman there is your uncle. Uncle... meneer Matheus. -Matheussen. -Sen. Achiel. -Hello, meneer Matheus. -Sen. My smallpox has cleared up really well. You can go and spend a short holiday with them. -Why? -Donhet ask so many questions. Come on, Hector. After you, Sister. He's not a nutcase, is he? There's nothing wrong with Hector. But don't forget, he's lived with children for 35 years. No, no. In one area he is a bit behind. He has never had... -Hasnhet he ever... himself? -No. And you've never... He's very dear to us, our Hector. He does all the odd jobs round here. Now we'll have to do them ourselves. -Shouldnhet we help him with his luggage? -No. He arrived with nothing and is leaving with even less. Donhet cry. I'm only going on holiday. I want my glasses back. You lost them fair and square. I don't want... -And I want my train. -And my lamp. Look at that, glasses. Now they all want something. Nice hearse. Turbo charged? Donhet know, Sister. It's not mine. Come on. Hector. Sir... is it much further? Spread it out well and don't use too much. There. Did you see that? When you've finished, wash out the pots and fetch three bags of flour. Open two tins of pineapple, weigh out the sugar and put it in the machine. Put the yeast ready, empty the dough machine, put some water on the stove and melt the chocolate. And don't let it burn. Let off the steam, whip the cream, put the butter in the fridge, take the loaves out of the oven, scrub the floors and whisk a couple of eggs for the butter cream. If you need any work done, you can always ask me to do that, too, Uncle. Here we go. -Is that him? -That's him. Dad, now I've finally got time to train, it's pouring with rain. -I should have some rollers, Dad. -Rollers? -So that I can train indoors. -Anything else? Hé. How about getting on with your work? -What a horrible row! -Leave him alone. We need to be a bit careful with him. He's not as stupid as he uiterlijk. -He says he wants to go back. -Oh? A little orphaned fish. Wow! That stamp's come a long way. From the United States. -Let me see. -From America from Hollywood. And? -Nothing for me? -Not as far as I know, schatje. Aunt, there was a letter from the United Sta... MATHEUSSEN AND SON Christ! Well? -That's 24 banana tarts. -Wait, wait. -What's your club called? -Ikebana. Bravely Onward. So that's 24 banana tarts, 50 plum tarts... No. No. -What? -The other way round. -What do you mean? -People prefer bananas to plums. Achiel. Smart car. Good acceleration, I imagine. And the corpse in it, did you get that free with the car? Intelligent-looking face. A relation of yours? -Of Ella's. Ghijsels. Of Ella's. -You'd never guess. Then we'll do it like this. 600 petits fours and 1,000 truffles. -Hé. -2,000 truffels. -Canhet the lad have a drink? -And some turnovers. -Apple turnovers. -Yes, yummy. No, make it waffles. Here he is, folks. -What'll you have, lad? -Chocolate milk. Guido, chocolate milk for the lad. -What's your name? -My name 's Hector. -And yours? -Grégoire. There you go. Chocolate milk for Hector. And what do you do? -I'm Jos's replacement. -A new face at Matheussen's? Yes, Ghijsels, your Swa will have to watch out. Have you taken a good look at him? Looks like he's made from concrete. -He'll rip the pack to shreds. -That's the end of Swa. And I see he's already wearing his cyclist's cap. -Aunt Ella gave it to me. -Aunt Ella? -How is your Aunt Ella? -Fine. She stayed home, all by herself. -I think I'm going to buy a tart. -Banana, Grégoire. -People prefer that to plum. -Why? I prefer plum. Give me a beer, Guido. Here you are. Give me a gin chaser, too. All apricot. More chocolate milk. -Hector, can you drive? -No. Right. Take these. Yes, oh yes. My lukewarm loins have never been so tenderly touched as by your velvet... fingers. -It's only us. -Hello. Uncle Achiel let me drive. Great set of wheels, that racing hearse, GT sports model. -And where's Uncle Achiel? -Uncle Achiel is here. Aunt Ella. The noble countess. Get lost, you drunk. Come here, my schatje. You stink of drink. Bloody hell. It's always the same. No, Achiel, there are customers in the shop. No, Achiel, I'm too tired. No, Achiel, because I'm the countess. But when you rehearse with Ghijsels, -it's yes, no doubt. -Stop it, Achiel. -Yes, Grégoire. Here, Grégoire. -Stop it, Achiel! -Have you gone completely nuts? -You Dutch tart! He's got enough money to go to the café. But not to buy gear for me. Yeah, Swa Ghijsels, Swa Ghijsels. Swa Ghijsels wins because he's got the best roller system in the world. Anyway, what's the point of that nutcase working here for free? -I don't mind. I'm here on holiday. -Mate, you just don't get it. -Coffee, Aunt Ella? -Yes, please. -Oh... -It doesnhet matter. Here, share mine. Oh, my script. -Have you been acting long, Aunt? -Yes, in an amateur dramatics society. I'm going to be in The Cuckolded Count by William Van Crombrugge. Oh, him. I'd much rather be in films. Hollywood, Rome, Paris. Dakar. Liège-Bastenaken-Liège. A while ago I auditioned for a real film. I may get an important role. Then no one can stop me. Not even your Uncle Achiel. Jos. Jos! -What's that? -How do I know? -What's that? -Well, a supersonic roller system for Jos. So he can train indoors when it's raining outside. Look, it's very simple. After building in the catalytic converter and the probe, I fitted the multifunctional adjustment of the hydropneumatic rear axle load with an overdrive. Which is why the speed of rotation of the Delco and the camshaft improves the main brake cylinder by 28%. I had to adjust the brake exciter to the revolutions sensors that, via the front wheel hubs and the electric control unit, stabilise the electromagnetic valves. With this handle you can cut off the electrical current to the fan. Understand? Good. The crushable zones ensure that the fully-automatic transmission of the Danish pastries to the level control, thanks to the ABS, set the fan and the egg whisk in motion. The isometric contraction of the molecules in the egg white seizes up because the pressure in the whipped cream boiler is too high. It explodes. But, as a result, Jos's four-headed thighbone muscle and his pendulous orbicular muscle will be at an angle, and that is good for preventing the weakening of his long-toe tensor. -I repeat... -Enough. I said it, didnHet i? -Wait, it might work. -Of course it will. Hector, dough. Hector, dough. Hector. No, Grégoire, no. Isabelle. With the emphasis on le. Laughing scornfully and screaming. At her door was a strange creature. Le. -Le. -Let's get on, Ghijsels. -Isabelle. -Yes, Grégoire. -Isabelle. -Renaldo. For goodness' sake, Grégoire! Donhet hold your arm in front of your face. The audience canhet see you. No problem. -Isabelle. -Renaldo. My beloved, I could wait no longer. Oh, my bold captain. How reckless of you. Flee now. For if the count finds you here, he will surely impale you on his mighty sword. Oh Isabelle, my beloved, for just one hour by your side I am ready -to receive his short steel. -Sharp, Ghijsels, sharp. Sharp? Sharp. To receive his sharp steel. Oh my bold captain, your words make my head spin. Oh my beloved, lay yourself down. Lay yourself down here so that the aching of my heart can quench itself with your ripe fruits. Grégoire. The passion of love should come from your heart, not from your... Right, carry on. Where were we? His passion of love wasnhet allowed to come from his bum. Correct, yes. Right, come on. Come on. Yes, OK. OK. Oh my beloved, lay yourself down here so that the aching of my heart can quench itself on your ripe fruits. -I've got some lines to say. -Say them. Embrace me, my fearless love, and extinguish with all your weapons the hot hunger that torments me. Stop, stop. What's all that? More suppleness. More spontaneity. But controlled. Or I will scrap that kissing. The git. The bastard. He didnhet like the love scene, either. "More spontaneity, more suppleness," he says. Weakling. Weakling. Have you taken a good look at me? Donhet take any notice. He's got first-night nerves, that's all. It's like that every year. Ella. How about if just the two of us rehearsed, at our leisure, in some small hotel somewhere, then maybe the spontaneity and suppleness will come naturally, eh? Aunt Ella. Yes? -Are you there? -Yes. You're a fantastic actress, but that Ghijsels... Wow, what an amateur. The director says so... too. Did he have to come, too? He gets on Achiel's nerves at home. And he's already got heart problems. Aunt Ella, that fruit, where is it? -Fruit? -Yes, your ripe fruit. Oh, that ripe fruit. That's... That's... It means certain parts of the body. Do you understand what I mean? -No. -These here. -And he's allowed to touch them? -Oh, it's just acting. -Then I want to act, too. -You should've been in bed ages ago. I can sleep when I retire. Aunt, if you take your clothes off and he comes to have a look, is that acting, too? -Get out. -Grégoire. I said, get out. Who does he think I am? Come on, Hector. But Ella, it's raining. -He was a bit cross with you. -You shouldnhet say stupid things. He likes the stage as much as me. He's the only one who supports me. That smart alec. He gets under his own feet on stage. For just one hour by your side I'll jump up and down and cry. Isabelle. Renaldo. Isabelle, my beloved, lay yourself down here. Here? Oh bold captain, your words make my head spin. Fear not. With arms of steel I will carry you through these squelchy marshes. Calamity, thrice calamity. How long? How long... How long? How long must my soul be subjected to this evil torment? Hark, do I hear the voice of my beloved? I am shrouded in wisps of mist. -I see you not. Where are you? -Here, Isabelle. Here, by the babbling brook. See here my dagger, how it shines in the moonlight. Hurry to me, oh brave warrior. I am so very scared. You are but a stone's throw from me. Just as a stag longs for water to drink, does my heart long for you, oh Isabelle. Save me from this peril, for distress has impaired my vision. Reach out your hand and grasp mine. Our embrace will last for ever. Lay me down, gentle knight. The pebbles of this river bed shall be our cushions. Where's rest of the butter? Incline your ear in that direction. Do you not hear the beautiful song of the jenny wren? In the fridge. As it flies through the reeds. A thousand times more than my ears do my lips long for satisfaction. -Hector. -Silence! Yes, only silence can, like a balm, soothe our aching hearts. Enjoy to the full this hour. Forget the painful parting. Forty apple turnovers, 75 apricot tarts and leave my wife alone. -Hector? -And get on with it. But... But Uncle Achiel, how could you be so stupid? You should've turned this handle to off. I had arranged it so that the fan could be worked by muscle power or the mains. But not both at the same time. Has something been worrying you lately? Or are you stressed? Employ someone to help you in the bakery. None of us are getting any younger. I'll prescribe you some pills. And, Achiel, drink less and rest more. -And who'll deliver my orders? -Hector will do that. Yes, yes, you can count on me, Uncle Achiel. Does that little bike cost 55,000 francs? -How much money have you got on you? -About 4,000 francs. -Plus our orders. -What do you mean? -Lads, is something broken? -No, but we've come for a bike bell. -Does it have to be a particular make? -A good one, to use outdoors. Here. This is the one we sell the most of. -It's 93 francs, all-in. -There's 100. Keep the change. Look, you can have this apricot tart. Otherwise we'll have to throw them away. -You don't need to do that. -We do, because Uncle Achiel is ill. And he's not allowed to drink for a fortnight. And he drinks 24 shorts a day. And 24 times 40 francs is 906. For 14 days. That's 13,475. And when he's better, he'll keel over after 4 shorts. So we'll save on another 20 shorts. At 40 francs each. That's 875. Add on his antibiotics. Plus the 13,408. That's a total of 27,511. Plus the 5 percent from the bank you come to 38,000. And what does that bike cost? 55,000? We've got some money left. Here, take that with you, too. A saddle. Happy now? Yes, but canhet we buy some racing handlebars? Meneer, could we swap that saddle and that bell for those handlebars? They must cost about the same. -These here? -Yes. Yes, then you'll have to pay an extra 750 francs. -Thousand. Keep the rest. -Here you are. It's like Christmas. You can have these. -Take that, then. And that. -We canhet take that. -Here. Have these. -And these. -Now what? -I canhet get it into twelfth gear. Have a look in your book. It's all in Japanese. Amazing. And all with the tarts for the Ikebanas. That's the last time we ever come here. A pig. And I can do this, too. -A baby. -You should be on the stage. Yes. They should've let you out of that loony bin earlier. But I'm not a loony. Just a bit of an orphan. Orphan? -Why did you stay there, then? -No one came to get me out. Come on! That means that if I put you in that drinking trough and no one comes to take you out, you'll still be in it in thirty years' time? Tell me. Were there women in that orphanage? -Yes, but only children and nuns. -Good-looking? Not as good-looking as your mother. Ella? But Ella isnhet my mother. My mother has been dead for years. Dad remarried. -Who? -Ella, of course. Idiot. A new bike. A hole in the ceiling. And I've lost two sizeable customers. -He wasnhet going to cost anything! -He's only trying to help. No, no, no, that's it. I'm taking him back tomorrow. Achiel. You just need to be a bit patient with Hector. Maybe... you're right. Will it be alright like that, sir? Good news about the film. Madam. Thank you. Goodbye. And then there was coffee. What do you think, schatje? What do you think of this, schatje? What does this mean? Why did that have to be hidden? Because I don't want you flashing your bare arse at some camera. Luister to me, Achiel Matheussen. Being in films is more than just taking your knickers off. If you stop all that cycling nonsense, I'll stop acting. -You're at 42. -OK at 42. -At 43. -OK at 43. -At 45. -You're at 45 km/hr. -We're at 80. -OK at 80. -At 82. -OK at 82. -At 83. -OK at 83. -At 85. -OK at 85. -At 90. -OK at 90. -Congratulations, Ella. -Thank you. That's great. He's coming to the first night. Maybe I'll get an important role. Vittorio Tagliatelli. -An important man. -Stuck on the botTom of the ladder. -Idiot. -It's true. With plum jam. Come on, it's the fourth rehearsal and I haven't -set foot on the st... -Stage. -Th... th... th... -Thanks, Hector. -What was it like in the rain? -Oh, that was fun. We even rehearsed. Together, along the side of the road. He's got a fantastic memory. If he weren het my nephew, who knows. Right. Caught in the act. You despicable traitor. -Take that. Take that and that. -Stop, stop, stop. Stop. Grégoire, what does it say here? What does it say here, in fact? The captain falls to the ground, groaning, and dies. And you slide onto the floor like some blushing virgin. -Let's start again. From the beginning. -No, no, no. On for thirty seconds and then off again. That is the final stra... Find yourself another count. Take that and that and that, you despicable traitor. Are you happy here? Me, too. Aunt Ella. Aunt Ella. For you. COMMENTARY TEAM IT'LL BE OK GHIJSELS INSURANCE -Front wheel. -Yes. -Rear wheel. -Yes. Saddle. Left and right pedal. Chain. -Bell. -Yes. No. Valve, front and back. Handlebars. Number on back. No, no, no. He hasnhet got his number on. He hasnhet got his number on. -Come on, you. Out of the way. -I'm being sent away. Me, the trainer. -You know what to do. Pace yourself. -Yes. -Ride at your own speed. -Yes. You're ready for them. Testing. May I have your attention, ladies and gentlemen, sports fans. The tenth Tour de Zwalmzeel will start in exactly one minute. We're going win to today. Eighty-one young heroes are to be flung into the fray. -They will ride 35 circuits. -Out of the way. We're starting. -Good luck. -Pay attention. -Get ready. -Get ready. Swa. -Get ready. -Get ready. Wait. Go. FINISH Guido, Jos is going to win today. I'll eat my hat if he doesn't. Or buy a barrel of beer for the entire café. A barrel beer for the entire café. -Who won before? -Swa. -And who'll win today? -Swa. Guido, give these people a drink on me. Now. Oh dear, ladies and gentlemen, sports fans, it had to happen. There's been a spill in the cat's head bend. The traditional spill of the Tour de Zwalmzeel. One rider is lying injured on the ground, ladies and gentlemen. We don't yet know who it is yet. The others are carrying on. Vervoort's forehead is bleeding. It is number 43, ladies and gentlemen, number 43. Vandenbrande. Wilfried Vandenbrande is left lying injured in the road. Idiots. ONLY 14 LAPS TO GO Hector, I canhet get it into sixteenth. I knew that would happen. Once again the riders appear at the merciless roundabout. More than a thousand enthusiastic supports are jostling each other to catch a glimpse of them. The brass band is playing merrily away while the riders urge their sweating bodies on over the cobblestones. It's a battle of the giants, ladies and gentlemen. A fight to the death. And ladies and gentlemen, sports' fans, we hear that in this last circuit. One rider has escaped from the pack. He's said to have a 23 second lead over the pack. Hé, ladies and gentlemen, but this is fantastic. Sports fans, it's Jos Matheussen. What strength that lad has got in his legs. But Swa Ghijsels is trying to catch him up. Is this a return match? Jos Matheussen has got into difficulty. How many setbacks does this young sportsman have to suffer? Will his lead be big enough? Anything could happen. There he is, ladies and gentlemen, Jos Matheussen. Still in the lead. His lead is now only six seconds. -Only 200 metres to go. -Hector. -Peddle backwards, Jos. -I've tried that. -Out of the way, damn it. -Peddle backwards, Jos. Oh dear, that had to happen. Another spill among those in the lead. -You're not taking him with you. Come on. -No, it's over. -After everything he's done for you. -Screwed up everything, yeah. You wanted to send him back when we didnhet need him anymore. Donhet be so hypocritical. You wanted to take advantage of the nutcase. I didnhet know that Achiel was interested in acting. He's checking up on me. There he is. Vittorio Tagliatelli. What a man! Excuse me. Are you mevrouw Ella's husband? What did he say? No, no, we are Mrs. Ella's parents. -There. -Oh, right. Look, the count sent his cat. -What do you mean? -He's not coming. The bastard. Are you sure it's his cat? Hearts are trumps. The Founded in 1837 speaking. Hector? No way, Mrs. Matheussen. He's staying here. Yes, you can. Hector, telephone. Donhet want a telephone. Your Aunt Ella is phoning from the theatre. It's urgent. I don't want to speak to her. As you wish. I understand. Thank you, Sister. Maybe your aunt is on fire and you have to pour water over her. Maybe she's been bitten by a black dog and is calling for help. Maybe she wants to make love to you. My mummy said the nuns make love to the pope. -You haven het got a mummy. -Have so. If you're the mummy of an orphan, you're dead, aren het you? Come on, we're digressing. -Maybe she loves you. -Yes, Hector. Donhet care. Canhet get out of here anyway. -We'll help you, Hector. -Come on. I can hear thunder. Come on, put your trousers on. Luister. As the count isnhet here, he canhet enter the stage. So... -Ghijsels. -Yes. -You carry on kissing her. -OK. -Until the curtain falls. -OK. -Understand? -What a ridiculous end! -Got a better idea? -I think it's fine. Let's do it. -Here, Hector. -What a great jumper! It seems to be only half-finished. Here, Hector. There's new electricity in it. I can see lightning. -Hello? -The beaujolais nouveau has arrived. Come in. -Isabelle. -Renaldo. Oh Isabelle, I could wait no longer. Oh bold captain, how reckless you are. Flee now. For if the count finds you here he will surely impale you on his mighty sword. Oh my beloved. For just one hour by your side I am ready to receive his sharp steel. Oh my bold captain, Your words make my head spin. Oh my beloved, lay yourself down here, so that the aching of my heart can quench itself with your ripe fruits. Embrace me, my fearless love, And extinguish with all your weapons the hot hunger that torments me. Caught in the act. Retreat or I shall pierce you with my sword. But what are you doing here, sir, in this place? But I live here, you stupid sausage. The soil beneath your feet belongs to me. But that was not... That was not agreed. Unsheathe the dagger by your side so that my honour shall be avenged with buckets of blood. Fight then, my foolhardy suitors. To the winner shall belong my veil. But Ella... Isabelle, what must I do? Your liver I shall hang from the chandelier, your innards too. Leave, you, for your senses aren het five no longer. But Ella... Isabelle. -Here. Stab him, oh brave knight. -Knight? Do not think I take fright. Is something broken? I could have... -Here. -Hear the ringing. Where are you? You bag of bones. Take that. Right in your ball bearings. No Sister, I'm busy. As tempestuously as the foaming waves, do you overwhelm me, my wild lover. Here, my veil. -A new suit? -No, it belonged to Uncle Achiel. Jos, you're an orphan now, too. You are. Maybe you can go and live with the nuns instead of me. When we come back from Hollywood, you wonhet be on your own anymore. Hector. I think there's been a misunderstanding. Are we staying in America? No, they're only expecting me. -Take care of yourself. -You, too. Good luck. I may not be gone long. That's what my mother said, 35 years ago. -Jos would really like you to... -I know, but I'm going back. Here you are. Thanks for the great holiday, Aunt Ella.
