[ instrumental Christmas music ] ♪♪ [ instrumental Christmas music ] ♪♪ [ phone ringing ] Hey daddy. Mary. How s the book tour? I have news. I m coming home. What? Really? Now? I thought you had another two weeks. Well, I m gonna bring the book tour home and Laurie Lawrence. She s coming to the house on Christmas Eve. She s going to do a retrospective on me the release of my new book. How are the projected sales? Ok. I guess. I m not expecting it to be a best seller. And why not? Have you read it? Um, no. I um... I uh... I uh, I haven't had the-the time. Um... I sent you a copy. It s a busy time of year for me. I got the annual Christmas car sale... Yeah, ok. By the way... Sadie has not been coming to her figure skating practice. [ phone vibrates ] Oh, dad, hold on. Rob is calling. I m going to conference him in. Hey Rob, you re on with James and me. Mary, I m on vacation so this will be quick. I had sales do some consumer research and the general consensus is your book would sell a whole lot better if you were in a relationship. What? They'd rather take marriage advice from someone who s married rather than... single. It would look really great if you could have a man on your arm or the Laurie Lawrence show. How about Jess Hardy? He s rich, has that private jet you like. He s a self-centered, hypocritical jerk! I sort of agree with you. Jess won t work. Well, I have a friend, runs this dating service. We could buy someone. Rob, no. Brilliant idea, Rob. Hey, sorry, I gotta split. Mary, get someone on your side for the Laurie Lawrence interview or you might be looking at a dismal book launch. Ciao. I know. I ll ask Tom. He s your ex-husband. We re in a custody battle that s still not finished. How would that look? Exactly. If I were to work on my divorce... If your mother were alive to hear this... She s turning in her grave. It s all show, dad. Once Laurie Lawrence leaves town we ll revert to the status quo. He ll play along. No he won t, he s-he s dating that fireman. Woman. Jenny. Oh. You're forgetting he has two weaknesses. Sadie and Christmas. Horrible plan. This book was a bad idea from the start. I gotta go. Perfect. [ TV commercial ] Hello there. It's Honest Jay, and it's my favourite time of year. The Christmas season. For the month of December, if you buy a car from Honest Jay and it snows on Christmas Day, I will give you that car for free. Yesiree, you heard me. My deals are solid gold. Just ask. Just ask my best customer, two-time gold medalist Mary Hamilton. The only dealer you can trust, or his name wouldn t be [ simultaneous ] Honest Jay. Honest Jay. [ sirens ] [ emergency radio ] What ve we got, chief? Abandoned house fire, kids playing inside. It doesn t sound like they all got out. You ready, Parker? [ sobbing ] Oh my god. Oh. Oh my god.

Anyone here? Fire department! Is there anybody here? I ll check downstairs. I ll check the bedrooms! Be careful! Fire department! Anybody here? Fire department! Hey, are you ok?

[ SCREAMING ] Parker!!!!!!! Parker, are you ok?! I m stuck! Save the kid! Parker! Go! Save yourself! Get out of here, now! I ll come back for you! Jenny, where s Parker? Where s Parker? You re alright. You re gonna be ok. Where is Parker?! That s him! Is he ok? Oh, sweetie, are you alright? Are you ok? Taylor, what s going on? Stay back, Tom. Jenny! Tom, let her do her job! Jenny! What re you doing? Jenny! It s not safe! Jenny! Tom, it s not safe! Jenny, what re you doing?! Jenny! I m out! Move it, Parker! The place is gonna crash! Jenny! Stay back! [ explosion ] [ cries out ] I owe you one. We cut it fine that time. What re you doing here? We were on our way home from the hockey game. Are you ok? Yeah. Jenny! Hi! What are you doing? Doctor said if I keep it loose my knee will heal faster. You're lucky it didn't break. You should be at home, resting. Uh, no thank you. I need the money. Besides, it s Christmas, you know. Well, just don t hold me up. Yeah, yeah. You re buying breakfast. Oh, yeah. James Hamilton. Hey, move that truck! Move that truck. I m in a fire zone, Mr. Hamilton. In front of my dealership. I m on town council and I ve spoken to the mayor about this. This is not the fire department's assigned parking. Well, actually it s a fire zone so it kinda is. Very smart. You know there s only two more days until Christmas and I m expecting a huge influx of people. One of these Christmases it s actually gonna snow. I haven t lost that bet in 30 years. I ll take a chance. Daddy! Mary. Hey. Ah, great. How was your flight? Splendid. It s good to have you home. Let s go eat. Yeah. It s good to be home. You know? You look great. What do you feel like? Uh, I feel like waffles. We re getting food. Waffles? Food. You gotta watch your cholesterol. There s Jenny! Get me something healthy. Hey! Hi Jenny. Hey, how are you? Perfect. I have gifts for the toy drive. No way, that s awesome. So many. Thank you. You re welcome. Hey, how did your hockey game go? We won! Of course you did! Just a second. That s great. I m sorry I couldn t be there. It s ok, you were too busy saving people. Hey. Hello my little angel! Mom! Hi! Mary. Mary? What... just one... How are you? Good. I had so much fun with dad. We started a new collection for the toy drive and my hockey team is in the semi-final! You missed figure skating practice. The competition is in two weeks. But that s when the hockey semi-finals are. Some things are more important than others. [ speaker ] Honest Jay, please come to the office. Sadie, honey, hockey is for boys. Us girls, we figure skate. But there s two other girls on my team. It s a co-ed team, Mary. You know how important figure skating is to my father. Don t force your desires on her. Dad didn t pick hockey. I did. Brainwashed. Hey, he s a great father. Uh, Jenny, don't you have a fire to put out or something? You should have seen the one last night. You went to a fire? A big one. We were driving by, it was- And Jenny saved a little boy. Did she? Yeah. And then we went for ice cream after. Oh, hey. So you two are dating? College friends is what dad says. College? Oh, I see. We met before college in the Olympics. Hey, look. I m not looking to complicate things. Yeah, you ve opened a freight train of complication. Tom, I need to talk to you. Privately. Uh... I need Sadie back. But you said I can have her this year. And now I m taking her back. It s officially my year. Don't... Look. I need your help. There's a lot of people coming into town to celebrate the release of my book and promote sales. I need you to play along. We re repairing things. Things? What-what things? Our marriage. What?! Play along or I petition the judge for full custody and Sadie ends up at St. Agnes Girl s School in London. Would you like that? That would never happen. Oh, really? Well, maybe I'll just keep her until after the new year. You wouldn t dare. Hmm. Look, I have these gifts for her and they re very special, ok? She needs them Christmas morning. It s important. Well then have a lovely Christmas morning. Alone, or with what's her name. Jenny. You know that. Whatever. Mary, you need to go. Neighbour called, says there s a strange van parked in our driveway. It s the film crew setting up to film the teaser. Teaser? What, today? Yeah, it s to promote the Christmas Eve special. What s wrong with parking on the street? Sadie, come on. Let s go. But I thought I was staying with dad. Well, plans change, sweetheart. Just- Mommy needs your help. Go with your mom, ok, kiddo? I ll call you later. Bye Jenny. Bye sweetie. See you soon. Bye dad. See ya, sweetheart. Love you. I love you, too. Hey. Chop chop, let s go. I always win. Bye dad. Bye Jenny. See you. I ll talk to you later. And you married her? It wasn't always... no, you know what? It was actually always just like that. We all make mistakes and I chose not to keep living in mine, so... Walk me to the shop? Ok. I was really looking forward to watching Sadie open her gifts with us. So Mary s keeping her? Maybe. Tom... Do you remember the night we first met? Uh, yeah. Last year s toy drive. You were the most beautiful woman in the firehouse. I was the only woman in the firehouse. That s true. What was that line you used on me? Oh. "I checked it twice, you're on my naughty list." Pretty smooth. I don t know about that. Yeah, you took pity on me. You were the most tightly-wound man I had ever met. Hey, I had just given up my career and moved here to be close to Sadie. Exactly. Tom, you would do anything for your daughter. Don t let some has-been ice skater push you around. One of the reasons I fell for you is that you never give up. Oh, really? Mmmhmm. And the other reasons are? [ phone rings ] My mother. Your mother? Yeah, they wanted to come out but I m working Christmas Day and I thought we were spending Christmas Eve with Sadie. Look, just because I don t have Sadie doesn't mean our plans should change. Ok. Ok. Hey. Hmm? What did you get your parents for Christmas? Oh, a gift card. Jenny. What? Oh, that is such a Christmas cop-out. How? Text her right now and ask her what she wants. No way. She can buy what she wants with the gift card. Nope. I will... That s my phone. What are-woah, come on. Dun dun dun. Boom. There. I can t believe you just did that. Well, believe it. [ message alert ] Oh? Ah, you see? What does she want? I thought you d never ask. We would really like a copy of Mary... What? Mary Hamilton s book signed to me and your father, please. Perfect. Sorry. [ radio ] Engine 7, there s a 10-35 at Olive and Pierce. I better go. Jenny! Sorry. We just got a call from a retirement home. I heard. Hey, Parker. Yeah. Hey, Tom. Uh, yeah, I should- I m gonna go. Bye. Ok. [ exhales ] I m gonna ask you a few questions so just act like we're doing the interview scheduled for the upcoming live show. Uh... Just answer the questions honestly. Yeah, ok. Not again. Hi, Jenny. Hi, Mr. Richards. He does this every Thanksgiving, Christmas, all the holidays. I think he gets lonely. Well, since we re here, should we check your blood pressure? Ok. Ok. Thank you. [ n TV ] I'm Laurie Lawrence. Please join me tomorrow night on my Christmas Eve special. I have the 2002 Olympic American hero, Mary Hamilton. Mary Hamilton-Norris. Right. You ever wonder why Mary kept Tom s last name? Ok. Ok. Know your place, rookie. [ on TV ] So, many of us are wondering, why did you write a book on marriage, considering you are divorced? What makes you the expert? I d like to hear this. I m just gonna check your heartbeat. You know, when one reaches for Olympic gold it starts as a dream. Then you wake up at 3am every single day and you practice for five hours. You take a lunch break and practice for another five hours. Working on your axel and your lutz, and when you fall you get right up and you try again and again until it s perfect. Mary, that sounds like a lot of work for a young child. Yes, it was. Uh, but that s what it takes. So you applied your time on the ice to marriage? When I realized what I went through training for the Olympics could also be applied to a relationship, the lightbulb went off. I know the mistakes that were made, d how Tom and I can change for love. Tom? I didn t give Tom enough time to mature sufficiently as both a husband and a father for our daughter. True love prevails. True love? Jenny... I love Tom, and deep in my heart I know that he still loves me. Jenny! Tom and I are working on things using the techniques that I laid out in my book to help solve our past differences. America s sweethearts. Back together again. Yes, we are, aren t we? Jenny! I m so sorry. You know what? I m gonna step out for some fresh air. Yeah. Hey. [ phone rings ] Hi mom. Yes, I got your text. I ve been busy. Sorry I didn t reply. Look, I will work on getting you the book but no promises, alright? Because she s the ex-wife of my boyfriend. Yeah, that s weird. There s a fire. Mom, I gotta go. Come on! I told you not to plug into the Christmas lights. It s too much power. You call yourselves professional. I m calling dad. [ sirens ] [ sirens ] I m gonna go get ready for the Christmas special. Good luck. Uh... Woah, woah, woah. No, no! Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! You re-you ll ruin it! Stop! Stop! No, no, no! Stop! You re gonna ruin it! No! Sorry? What re you doing? What re you doing? What are you doing? Wait 'til I talk to Chief Taylor. Heads are gonna roll! Woah, so cool! Let s pack it up. Hey, Jenny. Hey. What s that? Oh, that is the pressure gauge. The Duke? What s that? That is the name of our truck. Couldn t you name the fire truck maybe a girl s name? Like Missy or Charlotte or... Or Sadie? Yeah. Judge Willis. Hi, how are you? Good. Wanna cool off? What s up? They act like I don t know. Always having secret meetings. Why couldn't they just figure it out already? Well, sometimes adults have different views. They need somebody to mediate. Like be the boss? Mmm. Like a judge. Sadie! Are you ok? It was so cool, daddy. I wish you were here to see it. Oh. [ chuckles ] James has got to be mad. Do you want to come watch mom talk on TV? Yeah, Tom. Why don't you go join in with Mary? Uh, Sadie- I know, give you a minute. More secret meetings. Hey. Jenny, what is going on with you? Oh, come on, Tom. Surely you saw the interview. Ok, I don t have a TV and she would be the last thing I'd watch if I did. Ok. Well let me fill you in. Her Christmas wish is for you two to rekindle your true love. Jenny. Look, if pretending there s stuff going on helps her sell a few books and gives Sadie a nicer Christmas, who cares? I care. Come on. Haven t you noticed? Mary wears two faces. Hi, Tom. Hi, Mary. Excuse me. Eggnog with bourbon. Your favourite. Do you want a glass? I heard you were making things up on national TV. Come home where you belong. I have a home. I belong there. Thank you. So sad. Bad dad. No presents from you for Sadie under the tree this year. By the way, you re too old for chutes and ladders. No, don t! She s a national hero. Come on. What now? Don t ever bring this thing in here again. It s banned. You gotta be kidding me. Tom. What? Can you take Sadie for a couple hours? Yeah, sure. Hey, did you know about this? My jersey! I ve been looking everywhere for that! Thanks. Dad, I m hungry. Can we eat? Sure, sweetie. How about Joe s? And can Jenny come, too? Um... Please? Sure, why not? Yes! Joe s? Yeah. I ll just tell Parker. Ok. Come on, kiddo. You ok? Yeah. Someone you know? No. We re done here. Ok. I ll be on the radio. Ok. No, I know. I know. But... she's threatening to keep her. You ve got a stringer. Cut it. Cut it! Cut it! We re in a restaurant. Ok, you know what? I ll talk to you later. Ok. Who was that? Um... a friend. Daddy, can I please go play in the jungle balls? Please? Sure. Why not? She knows. What? That that was your lawyer. You think? Yeah, she s a kid, not deaf. Look, Mary filed for full custody. She won t get it. You re very sure about things. Look, a family is whatever you make it. As long as there s love there s no reason for the judge to take her from you. You are an amazing father, Tom. Thank you. Of course. I mean it. You re right. The spaghetti is amazing. Jenny! Come in! I don t know, honey. Come on, you re a firefighter! You have to save me! I m drowning! I m drowning! I think you have to save her. Alrighty then. I m coming! Sorry. Sorry. Here I come! Wooo! [ screaming and giggling ] [ laughing ] Daddy, come in! Yeah, come on, daddy! Ok. Aaaaaargh! [ giggling ] [ laughing ] Last chance, Tom. Yeah. Are you really gonna do this? You know, if you play along, then no. I need you on the Laurie Lawrence show tomorrow, holding my hand with a smile, acting like we re in love. That... that would hurt others who might... I don t really care who it hurts. It s what I need. And when Laurie leaves town I ll agree to the custody agreement. Shared custody? Yes, Tom. Everything that you want. Laurie s crew is gonna cover my book signing, then the yearly family photo with Santa, and after that the interview with Laurie Lawrence at the house. You will be at all three. I ll think about it. Yeah. Think real hard. So? I um... well... [ radio ] Engine 7 you have a 10-35 at Maple Ridge. I gotta go. Yeah. I ll see you tonight at the toy drive dinner? Of course. Ok. [ radio ] Jenny, truck's ready to roll. See you tonight. Yeah. [ Christmas music plays ] ♪♪ That was probably the best meal I've ever had. Thank you. I am stuffed. I couldn t have another bite. [ laughs ] Ok, ok. Oh, thank you. Ok, what is the best Christmas gift you ve ever gotten? Ah. Go. Jenny. Easy. When I was five I got the biggest box under the tree. I was so excited. So I open this box and inside it was another box. [ laughs ] And another box. And another box, and another box, until finally I get to this box about this big and there is a fire chief s helmet. It had a flashing red light, a siren... drove my mother nuts. I- I know this toy. Late 70 s, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It sold out in five days. It s a huge collector s item now, actually. And that was your best Christmas gift? Oh yeah, I wore that thing out. I was so upset when it broke. Tom, your turn. I got Sadie a brand new pair of skates signed by Henrik Lundqvist. Woah. Number one goalie for the New York Rangers? Oh. Yeah, she s gonna freak when she sees them. Wait, it was supposed to be your best gift. Well, this will be my best gift. For Sadie. remember my uh... last Christmas with my dad. I woke up before everyone else and I knew better than to open any of those presents. So, while I waited, I ate every single candy cane off the Christmas tree. [ laughs ] Parker! [ laughing ] Wow, I got so sick I threw up all over the presents. Eww! Oh, Parker. So my father walked in and I thought for sure I was gonna get a good licking. But he just cleaned me up and he just laughed. [ laughs ] Two weeks later he left and I never saw him again. Until today. In the car? The silver truck. Yeah. Parker? You should talk to him. No. No, sir. I waited at that front door for weeks expecting him to come back. He never did. I never want that again. So if he feels bad about that then good. He should. [ someone clinking a glass ] Hello everyone. As the head of town council I d like to thank everyone for coming out tonight and helping those less fortunate. And we d like to recognize this year s top donor. And the winner is... Our hometown hero Mary Hamilton! [ cheering ] What? [ applause ] He cheated. You gave way more presents than her. It s ok. It s ok. Thanks. Thank you. So much. Tom. How s the toy store? Well, actually- Sell something real and you might make a living. Toys are for kids. Like Sadie, for instance. Alright, you know what? This hockey stuff needs to stop. You know what, James? Forgive her. If she enjoys both hockey and figure skating. I mean, look at who her parents are. Don t you go wasting your money on hockey gear. It will not be allowed in my home. I bought her a new set of custom skates. Even took a mould of her feet while she slept. You did what? Dad, Sadie wants a tablet. Yeah, and you wanted a Polly Dolly instead of skates but I know better. I was heartbroken when I got those skates instead of a Polly Dolly. Those skates took you to Nationals and then Worlds. Sometimes kids don t know what s good for them. And Sadie- Sadie has a pretty good idea of what s good for her, ok? And I think she can choose for herself. It s getting late. It's time to call it an evening. Yeah. Come on, honey. Do you really think Mary has a chance in the world of taking Sadie from you? I wouldn t put it past her. There s a lot of factors at work. And where do I factor in? College friend. Honestly, I d just prefer to keep you out of it. I want to hear you say it. Say what? That we re more than just a Friday night movie. Or a lunch at the bistro. Or... or a convenient hand to hold. I want you to say we re- Mary, she s made things really complicated for us. And I worry about Sadie. Look. What we have is very special to me, ok? I just don t want Mary to ruin it. Well, I m telling you, going along with her lies will. Ok. You know what? You re right. Tomorrow I will set Mary straight, I promise. If you don t, I don t know how seriously I can take us. I uh... I mean, yes. Of course. Ok? Ok. [ radio ] It s Christmas Eve and it looks like yet another year without snow. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you. Great. Thank you. Merry Christmas! [ whistling ] Ok. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. [ sing-songy phone ringing ] Merry Christmas. r. Norris? It s Judge Willis. Oh. Hello, Judge. Is everything alright? Is there something I can help you with? Sorry, I um... uh... You re a firefighter. Yes, ma am. Retired captain at the Fourth Street station in Phoenix. You re Parker s dad. He doesn t want me around. I should go. It s not too late. I believed that last year, when I first reached out to Parker. But now I m not so sure. He told me a bit about you two. How you left him when he was five. His mother and I split. I was devastated. Angry. I walked out and didn t ever want to look back. I got remarried and my new wife made sure I cut all ties with my ex. I moved to Phoenix. Days became months, months became years. And 20 years later here I stand, realizing I made the biggest mistake of my life not fighting to see my son. I just called him, but he threatened a restraining order if I didn t leave him alone. I wrote this. It explains everything. I mailed it to him five or six times but he sent it back every time, unopened. I thought perhaps if I gave it to him in person, maybe then he ll read it. Why don t you give me that? Where are you staying? Windsor Hotel. Wait. I m Jason. You never told me your name. I m Jenny. Merry Christmas, Jenny. Merry Christmas. [ fire bell ringing ] Never a dull moment. Oh yeah. [ sing-songy phone ringing ] Hi, Mary. Good morning, Tom. What are you doing? Just some last minute sales. I still own a toy shop, you know. Tom, not acceptable. I promise things are not gonna go your way if you don t play along. Well then we both lose, don t we? If I don t show, I lose, you lose. Tom. This is important. You need to show up for the family photo. Can t we just be adults about this? It s just pictures. Think of your daughter. Look, I don t know about this scheme, ok? Do this for me and all your grief will just disappear. Ok. Fine. Thank you, Tom. Oh, and don t forget about the book signing and also the, uh, book interview. I-I ll see you later, ok? Bye. Wait, what? [ upbeat Christmas music ] ♪♪ [ upbeat Christmas music ] ♪♪ I can t believe this! What s the problem? Look! Oh! Come on, I have the solution. Oh... [ whimpering ] Hang on, I m coming. Why? Why today, the day of all days! Ow. Get this piece of meat off of me! Ugh. You remember Nationals? Yeah, dad. All around gold medal? Yeah, dad. I ll never forget. You made me miss mom s Thanksgiving dinner with her family so that we could rehearse the routine. And your mother understood. Uh, yeah. Keep telling yourself that. Get... I'm a vegan! This piece of meat saved our butt, and will do it again if you let it. Uh, no. Dad, I m not a kid anymore, dad. Oy. Oh, hey. Did you get the list of gifts that I gave for Sadie? I got the list, yes. Ok, did you get any of the items on the list? No, Mary, I did not. I refuse to get her a tablet. She needs to focus on her skating, not video games. Dad, I want to make her happy. Happy? Kids don t know what they need and you shouldn t be placating her. It s bad enough Tom does. Oh, Tom. He s gonna be here. And why is that? Well, because we re fixing things. Splendid. And it s just to drive up my book sales. Something about me being single and my book is about being married. I- I don t get it. [ phone ringing ] Ah, Rob. Hey, I m in Thailand. What happened in Barbados? Oh, raining. Hey, this call s ten dollars a minute but I had to tell you we had a huge pre-sale on your book come in yesterday. Really? What does that mean? That means you are just a few thousand books away from being a New York Times bestseller! What? Really? This is so amazing! Wow. I thought I'd get it on the list must be short. I got a call to make. Such a party pooper. Mary, do you have a man for the show tonight? ah, yeah. Tom will be here. Good. Get him on your arm and you will be the next New York Times bestseller! [ gasps ] Catch ya later! Good luck! Rob? Rob! Ugh. Ok. Morning. Wow, mom. That- No, not one more word or you re gonna be on Santa s naughty list. Go get dressed. [ sing-songy phone ringing ] Oh jeez. Hello? Hey, where are you? We re gonna be late. Yeah, you know what Mary? I thought about it. If you wanna go to war, I m ready. I don t have to play along. I will drop my presents off and spend next Christmas with Sadie as per our agreement. I won t take your gifts. Mary, there s one that she really needs next week. I ll make sure she doesn t see them until next year. That's... you're being unreasonable! That s how I play, so you better be here in an hour or there s nothing for Sadie. Ok, fine. For Sadie s sake. But no book signing. I will be at the photo and the interview. That s it. You better be there, or else. [ sobbing ] There you go. It s been an hour and only two people. I m calling Rob. You should be visualizing your skating routine, not playing games. Ok. Done. It s a three minute routine. I already know it. There s knowing it and then there s living it. Dad, enough! Alright, I am here. Let s do this. Dad! Do you guys need to be filming all the time? Hey, kiddo! Aw, so glad to see you re here for me. Oh, uh.. uh, ok. Now, let s go do our family photos. Yay, we re going to see Santa! Mmmhmm. Dad, do you think Santa will get me the hockey skates that I wanted? Sadie, you re the proud daughter of an Olympic gold medalist figure skater. Hockey only earned your country a silver. Who wants to be second best? You know what, sweetie? Ask for what you want, I m sure Santa will listen, ok? Oh, over here. We have reservations for a photo. Mary Hamilton-Norris. Well, Merry Christmas. Just give me ten minutes. I m on a break. I have reservations already paid for. I m on a tight schedule. Look, lady, you ll have to wait. The photographer and I are union. A union Santa? Are you-are you kidding me? Ok, wait, we have a camera phone, we could use that. Come on everybody. No, no, no. That is not permitted, subsection two. I can t believe this. Santa will be back in a few minutes. Ok. Hey, can you pull over? I need to get something. Last minute gift? Yeah, for my mother. [ Mary ]: Come on, Santa. how me the Christmas spirit. I m on a timeline here. Are you really buying one of her books? It s not for me, it s for my parents. Yeah, you speak to Downer Santa. Maybe he ll listen to you. And now you re stealing? No. Nice try, Santa. Come on, Santa. I need to capture this festive moment. Here. Sign it. Wait, what? My parents know my handwriting. Just write "to Tess and Kyle". Come on, Santa. Ok. We need a picture. Did you hear that? Let s go, Santa. Sit on your throne. Wait, is that...? Yeah, come on, come on! Um... Let s go, Santa.

Even our town s firefighters read my book. Hey. I thought you weren t gonna play her games anymore. Look, she won t give Sadie my presents until after the new year. It s funny how you believe everything that Mary says. Jenny. Mary. Yes, honey? We re done. Done? It s over. Through. Never gonna happen, ok? I m calling my lawyer, I m fighting back, I m fighting for full custody. The war s on, Mary. No more games. Is that what you want? All your gifts gone to waste? You won t do that. Try me. Hey! What about me? You re a kid. These are adult issues. Stay out of them. Sadie... Look. I hope you realize the mistake you're making before Sadie does. My gifts will be under that tree tomorrow morning no matter what. No, they won t, Tom. Stay out of my house. Ok, you want to play? Let s play. Bring it. I am sorry you had to see that. It s like I m invisible. I can hear them, you know. I know. Hey. Thank you. Sadie, I am so sorry. There will never be another year like this. Yeah, ok. Hey, Sadie, let s go. I ll call you later, ok kiddo? See you guys. Bye, dad. Bye, Jenny. Bye, sweetie. She is going to be so heartbroken tomorrow morning. No skates under the tree. Santa always finds a way. I have a plan.

Parker, you need to give him a chance. Send it back. He regrets what he s done. You know what? I don't care! He was a firefighter, Parker. Just like you. One day you re going to want to know the truth. Maybe that truth will heal all the pain that s inside of you. Why not make that day today? "Dear son, "I wish I could take back the years I lost with you, "but I can t. "It s one of my greatest regrets "and I hope you will forgive me. I have always loved you and there s not a moment "that I don t think about you. "The birthdays I missed, your graduation, your marriage. "I can never change that, Parker. "But I can change what happens tomorrow. "I need-no, I want to be a better dad. "The dad you deserve. "I love you, Parker. "Your dad." [ sobbing ] Dad... dad... [ clinking glass ] Everyone. Everyone. I have amazing news. I just heard from my daughter s publisher that her book has made it onto the New York Times bestseller list! [ applause ] Who did you talk to? Rob s assistant. You re a success. Hardly anyone showed up for my book signing. And you choked Santa. You were lucky Jenny was there. Yeah, lucky me. Now, back to the New York Times bestseller. A toast to my Mary. I know you can do anything. You are still my little winner. Ok. [ out of breath ] Ok. Here we go. Oh, oh, oh. Careful. Focus. Aaaah, oh, oh. Whew, that is a long ways down. Here we go. Ok. To think, Santa does this every Christmas. Well, the things I do for you, Sadie. [ grunting ] Ahhh!!! Ohhh!!! Ok. Ok. I am... stuck. I believe that s Tom s car. Awesome! Is daddy coming over for Christmas? I think your daddy might be lost. Dad! Slow down! Faster, grandpa! Do it again! Ride s over. Tom Norris? Huh? You better not be in here or I m calling the police. You ll be spending Christmas Eve in the slammer. I told you he wasn t here. [ sing-songy phone ring ] Ugh. No. [ sing-songy phone ring ] [ phone vibrating ] Hey, Tom, we re just pulling into the station. It took a little longer than I expected so I m gonna be late tonight. Jenny! Jenny! Oh, frankincense. Shh! He s here. Sadie, you go upstairs and check. I m gonna go outside. Ok, grandpa. [ struggling grunts ] [ phone ringing ] Yeah? Mary, I just got a call from the "Times" and they re pulling you off the list. What? Why? Your father bought all the books. What?! James bought all the books from the first printing. It must have cost him a fortune. Oh, wait just a second. I can t believe him! Why would he do that? I m gonna put a hold on the order and the Times has given me until Monday to sort this thing out before they break the news. Gotta go. The news crew is here. Laurie, her plane flight was delayed due to bad weather. They wanna light the fireplace. What? I told them the flue was broken so they opted for the Christmas tree. Fine. Oh, thank you. So... can we expect Tom soon? Tom is delayed. Well, we re just gonna have to start without him. Dad, why don t you come and sit here? Yes, please. Um, just finals and then we re ready to go. Thanks. Welcome to the Laurie Lawrence show. Today I have a very special guest. Mary Hamilton-Norris here with her family to read to us The Night Before Christmas. Perfect. Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house..." Sadie. Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. [ dirt crumbling ] Sounds like the mice didn t get the message. [ laughs ] Uh, keep going, Sadie. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care... [ on TV ] In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. Thank you. Uh oh. [ phone vibrating ] Ok. Carry on, Sadie. The children were nestled all snug in their beds... Mom? "While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads." "And mama in her kerchief and [ Tom joins in ] "I in my cap had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap..." "When out on the lawn, came such a clatter..." I rose from the bed to see what was the matter. [ on TV ] Who s up there? Let s just go to commercial. [ phone vibrating ] Oh no. [ voice mail ] You got me. Leave a message. Hi, Tom. It s Jenny. I m here. Where are you? I will give you that car for free. Yesiree, you heard me. Great. My deals are solid gold. Hello, Tom. Ho, ho, ho, James. It s Tom. He s in my fireplace. Daddy! Stand back! He s busy. It s messy. We just need to re-schedule this interview. I will have my office contact you. Uh, Laurie. Hey. What s going on? We-we should continue. No, Mary. With your ex-husband in the chimney? We can intro Tom coming from the chimney for the special- Mary. Can I give you a piece of advice? I ve interviewed a lot of celebrities. The ones that seem to be doing the very best in their lives were those who were independent. They stopped chasing something bigger and they were happy with who they were. You can t please everyone. Maybe it s just time that you try to just be yourself. You can do this. I know you can. Merry Christmas. May I join you? Hey. Of course. I want to thank you. I need to apologize. Parker can be quite hard-headed sometimes- I m meeting him here in five minutes. He wants to talk. Really? Probably gonna give me a restraining order but at least I'll get to see him. I hope things work out for you two. Thank you. Can I grab a beer? Daddy? Hey, sweetheart. What re you doing up in the chimney? I can t really say. Just don t look up here, ok? The falling dust is really bad. He needs help. I ll help him. No, grandpa! Just a few whacks and he ll be loose. Come on. Open up. This is stuck. I m calling 911. [ clanging sounds ] Hello, my name is Sadie and I need Jenny Jenkins to come to my house. [ Operator ]: Ok, what seems to be the problem? My daddy is stuck in the chimney. Stuck in the chimney? Mmmhmm. Let s get him out of there. Thank you. Mmmhmm. Relationships are tricky. Hey, Jenny. Hey, Parker. [ phone ringing ] Dad. [ phone ringing ] I got this. You stay with your dad. You sure you don t have to go? No, I m uh, I m off the clock. Can I get that beer, please? Thank you. Look, I talked to mom. Just tell me one thing. Why didn t you call? Or come visit? I waited every day so I could hear your voice or see your face again. I was afraid of what you might say. Does that really matter? Of course I was mad! Of course I wanted to hate you. But I can t. I loved you, dad. I missed you, and all I wanted was to be a part of your life. I wanted to hear your voice, even for one brief moment. I m sorry. Parker, I am so sorry. [ sobbing ] Um... mom told me about the entire thing I m so sorry I didn t- Parker, that s long done. We don t need to rehash all that. I saw a photo of your family on the internet. They look great. You re a grandpa. Grandpa. I like that. I like that a lot, man. It s good to see you. I missed you, dad. Open up! [ banging ] Oh, man. [ struggling ] Whew! Tom? Jenny! What are you doing? Oh, thank god you re here. We had a date. Yeah, I m running just a little late. Holiday traffic and all, you know. Ho, ho, ho. [ laughs ] Not funny. What was wrong with the door? It was locked. Hey, look. I m doing this for Sadie. No. No, you re not. You re doing this for you, and what you re doing I can no longer be a part of. I know, I m stupid. Look, can we just get me out of here and then talk about this? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Here. Stretch a little further? Come on. Unstuck... [ grumbling ] Stretch. Almost. Come on. Just a bit further. You can do it. I know I can do it. We got this. You re right we got this. Come on. Come on. Tom. [ grunting ] No, don t pull me in! [ crying out ] Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! [ gasping ] Daddy! Jenny! Yes! I knew she d save you. Hi. Jenny, do you wanna stay for the first Christmas present? We always open one before bed. Sadie, honey, can I talk to your dad for a moment? More secret meetings. Hey. I am so sorry about all this. Tom. Jenny... You ruined everything. Hey. Tom. I need to break up with you. All this? It s way more than I can handle. No, Jenny, please. I- No, the games, Tom. You re still playing them. I can no longer be a part of it. It is over, ok? You got that right. Jenny... Jenny. [ sighs ] Christmas Eve. What is this? Put. That. Down. I will not allow my granddaughter to play boy sports when she has the natural ability to be something great. She will not play hockey anymore! You are unbelievable. She is your granddaughter! Yeah, who will follow in her superstar mother s footsteps but without the mistakes. Like marrying you. Look at you. You were never in Mary s league. Sadie deserves so much better. Oh, really? Oh, really? Can any of us live up to James Hamilton s out-of-reach standards? Stop! You re always fighting and having secret meetings! I can hear you! I wish I could just be like Jenny and break-up with all of you. Sadie! Sadie. Tom, you caused this. Get back down here! James! Stop! What did you say? You re done controlling me. You took Christmas away from me too many times when I was a young kid and you re not gonna do this anymore. If my daughter wants a tablet or to play hockey, she can. You re not turning her into me. A- a champion? Do you even remember my eighth grade Christmas? You made me practice at 7am and work all day. I didn t even get to open my Christmas gifts until the next week. All that pounding in my head of winning and look at me now. I m still living in your house. I m practically broke and the book that I wrote, you cheated the sales. And my daughter, she hates me. I m a bitter woman, and Sadie is not gonna turn into that. You made me proud. I m a trophy on your mantle. A gold medal in a box. You should have given me a Polly Dolly instead of those skates. You re done controlling me. I m moving out tomorrow. I m going to start my life over. I- I didn t know you felt that way. And those books, they re for my customers. You made it worse. The New York Times knows that it was you and now they think that I m a cheat. You re a winner, Mary. I want you to always have the best. And I want you to be a grandfather and a father who is supportive of us. Not someone who s controlling us or the situation. Mom understood. She was happy no matter the... the medal or the trophy that I won. She was happy just to hold me. I miss her. I'm... so sorry, Mary. Please... forgive me. [ sobbing ] I love you. I love you, too. I m really sorry about all this, sweetheart. It s ok. Now that the chimney s fixed Santa will have no problems getting down. [ chuckles ] That s right. Here. Thank you. They re really amazing, dad. I love you, honey. I have something for you and Jenny. You do? What? Why is grandpa all alone? [ laughs ] Thank you, sweetie. I love you, sweetheart. I m gonna go downstairs and check on things, ok? I need to say sorry to mom. I didn t mean what I said. Ok. Come on. Mom, I m sorry. Oh, it s ok baby. Come here. Where did you find this? It wasn t easy. You really love Jenny, don t you? Well, love is a two-way street and I think we just hit a dead end. Oh, come off it. It s because of you. Me? You never stood up to me, Tom. Even when we were married I pushed you around and you let me. This time... this time, you pushed back. And you got stuck in my father s chimney doing it. That firefighter, she s lucky to have you. You dropped something. So if you love her, then go get her. One more thing. What s that? Sadie s rightfully yours tonight. And tomorrow morning. But... why do we have to spend it apart? Why can t we all spend it together? We re all one family, aren t we? She s right. We are still a family, and I realize now that I made a lot of mistakes in my life and maybe I pushed a little too hard. Maybe? Ok, ok. So, I pushed too hard and I forgot about the details. I forgot about what Christmas really meant. Your mother s favourite time of year. And now there s more than a few nights where I wish I had just one more moment just to... hold her hand. And, looking back, I wish I would have ended practice earlier so that we could have spent more time with the one who supported us the most. Your mother. And I am so sorry, Mary. Sadie. And, well, Tom. Mom was really great, wasn t she? Yes, she was. And I think this Christmas we are going to spend it as a family. And I think that includes Tom and Jenny. Yeah. Hey. So I had this big plan to give Jenny a very special Christmas gift that she would never forget, but, well, getting stuck in the chimney kinda ruined it. I need help. And I need to make a few calls, but I d like for my whole family to be a part of this. Can you all help me? Yeah, sure. I ll support you. Ok, we re in. And I promise I ll stay out of the way. Yeah, let s do it! Ok. Let s go. [ sobbing ] [ sobbing ] [ sobbing ] Jenny? Jenny! Jenny! Jenny? Jenny! Jenny! Jenny, come on out, now. Everyone s here for you. Come on! We know you re up there, come on! Jenny! Jenny, come on out! Jenny! Jenny! My boy was pulled to safety by a guardian angel. Had it not been for a young woman who was willing to risk her life for him, he may not be here right now. You are my hero, Jenny Jenkins. I wanna be just like you, Jenny. A real American hero. I love you, Jenny. You saved my house from catching fire. And you pulled my ex-son-in-law from my chimney. [ crowd laughs ] You re a hero, young lady. There s no doubt about it. If anyone knows what it means to be a hero, it s you. And that s exactly what I wrote to your mother. I m sure she ll understand that it s a book about your life she should read. Not mine. You are the reason I have my father back. And tomorrow morning I get to meet my grandson for the first time. I will follow you anywhere, firefighter Jenkins. Jenny. Not long ago, I met the most amazing woman. She s tough, strong, and has a huge heart. She is willing to sacrifice her life for anyone, no matter who they are or where they come from. Jenny, every single day you inspire me to be a better person and you never ask for a single moment of gratitude from anyone. So now we are all here to give you the best Christmas gift I could think of. Jenny, I love you. You are my hero. What did you say? I love her! [ Sadie ]: Me too! [ crowd laughs ] What did you say? I love you. Tom... Woah. Oh... I promise to hold and cherish you. I want to grow old with you, and never let go of your hand. Please, Jenny. Will you forever be my wife? Yes! Yes. [ laughing ] She said yes! [ cheering and applause ] [ crowd cheering ] It s perfect! It is. It is perfect. [ applause ] Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! It s impossible! So I m guessing the car I bought yesterday is free! [ cheering ] You know what? You re right. Merry Christmas. And a very Merry Christmas to every one of you. I love you. I love you, too.
