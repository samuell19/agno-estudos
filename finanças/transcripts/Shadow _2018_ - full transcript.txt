May I speak with you, sire same same commander... Him again what now? He visited jing city yesterday what? He went to jing for what? To give Yang a birthday greeting he went yesterday and you only tell me now? Pe My most trusted minister this is how you serve me? Has he returned? Not yet go, wait for him the minute he returns bring him to me right away yes, sire commander's residence What does it say? This reading is about masculine power no place for women here qian, the male, origin of all things shall rule the world this reading is "qian" this is heaven's will brother there's been talk of this in the palace the reading's also a positive sign when will the battle begin? Summer, or Autumn? The reading says... Our time will come in seven days seven days? After seven days of rain we'll win when the waters rise the commander enters! Our brave lone hero returns! Sister reporting I've heard you went to celebrate Yang's birthday I'm sure you gave a lovely speech I went to jing to claim one thing the city yan kingdom has occupied for 20 years is he willing to return it? So you declared war? Yang and I have agreed in a few days, under the city pass to duel one-on-one and see who wins our two nations are allies a duel between our chief commanders means war don't you understand this? He agreed to it alright then tell me are you sure you can beat him? Yes or no? What are your odds? 3 out of 10 at best absurd were it not for our peace treaty pei would have been lost long ago great work you've ruined everything jing city still belongs to pei it's under yan kingdom's occupation every righteous man of pei longs to win it back no ruler can oppose his people's will if jing isn't reclaimed pei will perish under your reign commander how dare you say that? I'd rather never take jing back than destroy the alliance on your behalf I've told them otherwise and would you also be king on my behalf? What's done is done and my punishment? Alright let's not argue father died too early my sister and I had only each other it was thanks to you, commander that I finally gained the throne let's drop the subject sire is right let's just enjoy this rare gathering I've long heard that you and your wife play the most exquisite duets I've always wanted to hear you will you play for me? = Our kingdom is in distress I'm... not in the mood commander don't disappoint the king yes, please we'll all enjoy your music come bring the zithers Come come. Come please What? I, your king can't get you to play for me? Commander Es se - = - I am guilty you haven't started yet what could you be guilty of? I will not distract my husband with beautiful sights and sounds I've sworn to heaven that until the day jing's reclaimed I'll not play a note of music otherwise otherwise what? I'll cut off my finger to prove my resolve An impressive vow to heaven but I am the heaven of pei I've asked you to play will you not obey me? Fine then don't play today take them away come they will play then I won't listen Commander madam is ready for you Madam's vow is mine as well I'll cut my hair to beg heaven's forgiveness commander, don't commander, don't don't do this Alright, don't play then no need to make a scene we'll take our leave Sire, why did you insist that commander play? I was just trying to deflate his arrogance I'll have to clean up his mess there's only one option left Yang's son, ping has not yet married, right? Sire means to say... Marry off my wild sister shouldn't we ask if she's willing? I'm her elder brother no need to ask you must make Yang understand: Commander doesn't represent me we don't intend to take back jing much less start a war my proposal will show my sincerity all right I'll choose a good day to go make the proposal you may leave yes, sire To play as one two hearts must beat as one as is the case with you and madam I haven't even dared to practice I deserve to die had you been exposed you would indeed deserve to die we'd both deserve to die you must master the zither and suffer this cut commander please proceed These herbs are harsh in an hour the wound will rot and look just like mine Whatever you're holding in... Let it out, you'll feel better let it out! When I was 8 I strayed from my mother and drifted, lost, through jing city I passed out from hunger your uncle happened to pass by I'll never forget that bowl of rice... I've been here over 20 years... Your days here have indeed been hard I owe you both my deepest gratitude uncle was a cruel man every time you tried to escape he beat you so hard you passed out this place is your prison, your cage press on it for me And after he died I put you through such brutal training you must hate me for it how could I hate you? I'd be willing to die in pieces to repay your gracious kindness it's Yang who should die in pieces if you kill him I'll let you go home My husband uncle was so right to choose you besides looking just like me you're incredibly quick-witted since making your debut a year ago you've been so good you've fooled them all sometimes I even wonder if my wife can still tell us apart? I've found your mother my mother she's still alive? She's still right there in jing wandering homeless in the streets I've bought your old house had everything set up she's settled in there now how did you find her? Does she know I'm still alive? So you have a huge stake in this battle after jing's taken you two can reunite Your zither needs tuning Yours is in the major key the strings need tightening Thank you You can go You've got just four hours to put this ointment on the wound you can't be a moment late Your husband is the most noble, most strategic, most admired man in pei and 1? But I'm nothing but a servant nothing more than his shadow you're not a shadow you are you who am I then? You were born in jing you yearn to go home maybe your mother is waiting at the Lane's end watching every passerby waiting for your return Many years ago my mother went blind she couldn't even see me if she were waiting there she could only listen, straining to hear the sound of my steps no earlier, no later you've suddenly found her, just in time to ensure I'll obediently fight this battle for you you've kept me caged in secret do you great, noble people know what scares me most? Darkness no one else no light no sound only me in total darkness I'd touch everywhere touch everything rub every tiny crack in the wall to keep from going mad to prove to myself I was still alive And so you always sleep on the floor with the lamp lit all night It's time for you to go to court the great hall of pei Who wishes to speak? I, sire proceed I've disobeyed your commands went to jing and declared war damaged the alliance please, sire, punish me and the punishment? Beheading brother you can't behead him our kingdom's great hero our great general you can't be beheaded how could we do without you? My dear lu what do you think? He declared war on his own put pei at great risk a grave error indeed cee === all right brother I hereby revoke commander's powers confiscate his sword and seals henceforth he is a commoner == == Do it I have no other choice you see this "ode to peace"? I wrote it and hung it here as a reminder to us all the alliance is our lifeblood anyone who violates it, lord or subject, will pay the price we will always keep the peace never speak of a war you can't win from this day on, anyone who speaks of this again will be instantly beheaded thank you for sparing my life I'm leaving wait brother what more do you want? Nothing I'm just holding court The commander has fought countless battles and suffered many wounds but the one that concerns me most is the wound from Yang's saber a wound few could recover from indeed, yes it still hasn't healed I've found a rare ointment that can heal your wound after you leave today, who knows when we'll meet again? I want to see you've used this so I'll know you'll be alright why trouble yourself with this? I'll go back and have my wife... As I said I want to apply it myself Commander's wound is pei's as well should any of you prove as loyal I would serve you the same way Commander this wound looks fresh you're trying to trick me I beg sire's punishment my old wound has healed this cut was self-inflicted my loss to Yang is my greatest shame this cut is a reminder that as long as Yang lives, my wound will never heal until we reclaim jing how can we speak of peace? How dare you brazenly resist my orders? I'm a commoner how I'll have my duel with Yang why should that concern you? At court today the king suddenly challenged him he handled it well despite the scare quite impressive he's good but no one could tell that wound is new the king was testing him My "ode to peace" is quite well-written why did you demote commander? So tell me why'd he have to go cut himself? Why bother? To remember the shame of defeat it was an honorable act he's not like you you wouldn't dare retake jing all you do is compromise you've become a pitiful joke I do this all for pei you think I don't know you? You do things only for your throne fine, for my throne... Which has never been safe for a day Legend says Yang's great saber was forged by a master blacksmith on a night of a full moon it's destined to take hundreds of lives as offerings to the saber god it weighs 40 kilos glows in the night glints cold in the day and kills in three rounds Round one you're not focused your mind is elsewhere Round two my dear husband you need to stop again I fear your strength won't hold why worry? It's either you or me come on Round three that was exactly the blow I took from Yang that day though I used only half its force, you're already done for my dear husband I'll help you up Your mind's elsewhere a distracted mind means shaky breathing shaky breathing means no firm steps how will you survive without firm steps? Have you forgotten who you are? Tell me who are you? What? You named me after jing city so I'd never forget our great cause I only need you because I'm dying focus on your task forget everything else Strokes with rhythm words that dance my unique style how exquisite wonderful superb calligraphy truly great Sister look at the "pei" I wrote what do you think? Lu is here leave Humbly reporting how was your trip to jing? The yangs have been told of your marriage proposal they are quite pleased good good brother who's getting married? Without even telling me? What do you think I am? A single marriage to make peace between two nations you're the Princess you should understand this I won't do it go yourself continue however to thank them for protecting the city, the king of yan has offered his daughter to Yang's son, ping they can't refuse so... what do we do? Well, ping has an idea which is...? Sire, may I brief you privately? What are you afraid of? Speak it's... Everyone here has risked his life for me in front of these men there can be no secrets ping proposes to take Princess as a concubine, thus fulfilling everyone's wishes Well that's... Also a way... Ping has offered his personal dagger as an engagement gift provided sire does not object, the marriage is confirmed kill those damn yangs give me 30,000 soldiers I'll bathe jing in blood seize jing city hack the yangs to pieces win jing back don't you dare have you forgotten my order? Those who talk of taking jing shall be beheaded this is spineless humiliating our kingdom will perish under your reign tian, how dare you defy the king drag him out strip him of his rank guards I'l do it How dare he be so insolent does he still see you as his king? Clownish king sire, tian's words amount to rebellion Don't trouble yourself, sire you... Sia sia Step aside Princess step aside I'll accept the gift tell him I agree Jing practice grounds You forced me back two steps good tactic, son we yangs are known for force, speed and death in three rounds but responding nimbly to a master fighter's moves is the true essence of our technique have you ever fought a true master? No, not yet When the pei commander visited what was your impression? Just as I'd envisioned him distinguished and strong that crippling blow I'd given him... I was shocked to see he's recovered completely, good as new, poised and gracious as ever he'd come just to see you, father he wouldn't dare give offense ping you've proposed to take the Princess as your concubine isn't that "giving offense"? I want them to give up trying to use a marriage to win jing city back but I've just been told they've accepted your engagement gift don't you think that's odd? So what? Their king dismissed their commander wounded tian forfeited two great generals they must all be demoralized and anyway if there's any sign of trouble there our spy will tell us right away, so there's no need to worry you're right father now that the city's stable his majesty has again asked us to redeploy troops... The situation's quite tense there let's do this keep 800 soldiers here and send the remaining 30,000 to support his majesty will we have enough left here? We have strong natural barriers... And in any case I and my saber are unbeatable 800 will suffice let me try I've often watched you I think I understand it pei umbrellas are soft and flexible they work best in the rain they are water weapons water is yin Yang's moves are hard and fierce like fire fire is Yang yin counters Yang water puts out fire and so wield it with feminine moves what do you think? Feminine moves? I designed this taichi diagram why haven't I thought of this? Watch us from the side madam come Madam practice with jing teach him quickly What are you waiting for? If we don't find a way to beat Yang we'll have wasted all our efforts This will be another Yang-style saber round hug tight together if our minds can meld as one you'll grasp the technique quickly madam pardon me This is it this is it this is it This is it get up though Yang's attacks are fierce he loses stamina fast = == tee es if you apply madam's technique you can kill him = = = creams sees ee ae - aa There's someone you must go see you can leave now en === Your hearts and minds were truly at one just now we were merely copying your moves... Why speak of hearts and minds? Can he win? Your technique can give jing confidence he has to believe he can win in order to last three rounds and after three rounds? I'll just need an hour That lingering, echoing melody felt trapped, with no way out that must be how you're feeling, sir you know what lies beyond the forest? 100 convicts in hiding they live for fighting and killing yet look strangely gentle I've promised to let them go free if they reclaim jing I brought them there to train, yet couldn't find a winning technique but now we have a way learn it, train them become their leader yes, sir take this flute when you play it they'll know you've been sent by me and they'll obey you I'll do as you say, commander commander wants to see you Commander I'm neither man nor ghost not the commander you've known you will always be my commander In the mang river battle you killed a dozen men to save my life suffered over twenty wounds lay in a coma for three days my little cut is nothing come When I was eight on the first day of spring father was assassinated it happened in court in front of all the ministers the killer cut his head off with an ax uncle worried I'd meet the same fate he searched everywhere at last, in jing city he found a boy my age who looked just like me he brought him here for secret training, hoping to shield me from palace intrigue to protect me that boy's become the "shadow" my wound worsened last year my health failed I suddenly aged no one is to know this... So you started using the shadow but madam, does she... Madam knows she pities him she's urged me to let him go home I called you here today so she can show you how to defeat Yang I see... That day the king inspected his wound... Did he already suspect he's a "shadow"? What do you think? Commander why stay locked in this narrow cell trying to read the king's mind? Why not replace him and become our king? There's not a general or soldier who'd hesitate to support you what impudence! Sorry the king serves his purpose Are very good you've always been good To win jing back I'll need three people one is the shadow one the king and the third is you from this tiny cell I'll launch my scheme and watch you each play your part, reclaiming our land on my behalf won't it be thrilling? And then? I will be king you'll be commander Sorry You're more like the commander than he is for a moment there I didn't know how to react I've been your commander I'll still be your commander that's all there is Yang's saber technique is hard and strong wield your umbrellas with feminine moves borrow the slickness of the rain using yin to counter Yang is our only way to win nonstop clouds and rain we'll win when the waters rise it's rained for four days if it rains for three more the river water will rise and submerge jing's storm drain commander rightly chose this moment for the duel whatever happens, win or lose the moment has arrived false, true true, false just like in a game of chess but who, after all are the pawns? So turning me into a concubine was also a move in your game? Just an improvised ploy, a decoy move and the real move, then? Tell me then, what is real? To tomorrow to a swift victory You left home so young do you know your way back? I think so you'll be able to find it? They say a pup taken at birth can find its birthplace by tracing the scent I've been yearning to return I know I can find it actually I also long to go home But isn't pei your home? Home has many meanings Isis ee to a swift victory I know I can't win tomorrow Actually you've had many chances to refuse you could have run away why didn't you? You've always seemed so obedient so willing to do this because of you when I was young I was being forced but since I've grown older and come to know you I've only had one thing in mind I would do anything for you In tomorrow's fight I'll be just a decoy no one cares whether a decoy lives or dies I care Tonight is the last you'll spend here Madam thank you Reporting to general Yang the pei commander has arrived alone says he's come as agreed Jing city pass Father how'd the ship slip through so easily? Some sort of cheap trick Our foolish king has dismissed me I've no power no soldiers honor our gentlemen's agreement duel with this commoner to see who prevails father something seems odd that's a taichi diagram on the deck it could be a trap it's just hocus pocus I'm curious to see what game he's playing I know you've agreed to do this but you should still be cautious how about bringing a few soldiers? We two have a gentlemen's agreement he's come alone if I bring soldiers won't I look like a fool? My saber father please be careful guard the pass protect the banner yes, sir I'll guard it with my life watch how I teach him a lesson Princess? Princess This is a pei umbrella made specially for this duel I humbly request the general's teaching and guidance Round one I can see you've taken great pains to prepare I couldn't dare do otherwise Round two Each man's crossbow has only 12 arrows so move right through, don't bog down Young general there are enemies in the city Remove crossbows open umbrellas Sie aera senn see == Block Ping Round three well done never in our family's history has anyone against the Yang saber not bad I'll save face for you let's call it a draw and stop here Let's go again we agreed to duel to determine a winner if we keep going now it will be for life or death come Jing city is taken Why doesn't a girl like you stay home where you belong? Did you come looking to die? You've insulted me insulted you? I don't even know you said you'd make me your concubine that was you? Sen I'm here to give this back to you what? Dear wife using the shadow was I right, or wrong? Some things don't have a right or wrong what's done is done Dear husband here, now let's play our music together Jing is taken Jing is taken ping Mother Commander promised to let me go commander promised to let me go I've been ordered not to look at your face on whose order?

Treated you as my closest confidant? My deep gratitude for sire's trust what trust? Have a special use your secret reports to Yang made our victory possible how much gold did he pay you?

It's because I'm truly happy when he conveyed my marriage offer Yang paid him a bribe, and he came back proposing my sister be made a concubine I don't care whose idea it was I had to take back that pound of flesh Now that you're back my mind is at ease see = are a true talent our kingdom can't do without you Alike very much alike don't you agree?
