Could I stop you? - Yeah. (lively music) - Did you come to bless my decaying apartment? - I could if you'd like. - Well, you can start with the television set. I haven't been able to get Oprah for about a week now. - Should I just cut straight to the chase? - Hm, what could I have done wrong now? - Your mom is concerned about your new job, dancing. - I'm proud of my body, Father. Let me show you something. (phone rings) I posed for an artist. The paint's not even dry yet. (dog barking) Do you like it? - There's a big difference between posing nude for an artist, and stripping in a nightclub. - You're right, the nightclub pays a lot better. - Paula, strip joints are designed to degrade women. - Men don't come to see me. They come to see a fantasy. - Now that's bullshit. - I wasn't meant to be a nun. - Neither are most nuns. - Whatever. I don't think our bodies are unclean. I don't think sex is a sin. It's a lot more rewarding than being in love. My mother was in love. Let some guy screw her, and nine months later, out I popped. Her love was long gone. - Is that what your mother told you? - Wasn't that the deal? It must've come up in confession, or maybe I was the result of a second immaculate conception? - Because Paula, if that's the case, then I think there's something I should tell you. - No, don't. Because I don't like being lectured to by my mother who thinks of me as penance, and I don't have to listen to a man who's hardly a man at all! (dog barking) (Paula sighs) (baby crying) I'm sorry, Father. I know that you're just trying to help, but I'm gonna be fine, really. - Goodnight, Paula. Just think about what I said. - I will. Goodnight, Father. (door creaks) (sirens wailing) (suspenseful music) - You shouldn't leave your windows open. (Paula sighs) - Rob, you scared me. - You seem to forget whose girl you are. - Relax, the guy's a priest. He's a friend of my mom's who came over and- (Rob grunts) (Paula shrieks) (engine rumbling) - That's all right, Paula. You see? It doesn't much matter anymore. — You're crazy!

(police radio crackling) - [Cop] Any idea who Rob might be? - [Tyrone] No, I'm sorry I don't. - [Cop] Tell me, Father. Why did you come over here this evening? - [Tyrone] I sometimes call on parishioners. - [Cop] Was Paula Brown having some religious problems? - [Tyrone] Her mother was concerned about her job. - At the Black Cat in Hollywood, yeah. My partner caught her act. So let me get this straight, the mother wanted you to talk to her daughter? - Paula, and her mother, communicated across a wide gap. I tried to bridge that. (somber music) - I may as well tell you now, Father. You're the only person anyone saw enter or leave the building around the time of the murder. - What exactly are you trying to insinuate? - That you're a suspect, and you should know that collar won't excuse you from this investigation. If you think of anything else. - I'll call.

I don't accept that. God's most precious gift to us is free will. Someone chose evil when they took the life of Paula Brown. So don't blame God for this disaster. Blame our relentless attraction to evil. And as for God, we commend our sister Paula to him, and ask that he bring her to the joys of heaven. And we pray to the Lord that he may help us in our sorrow, amen. (organ music) - [Priest] The chosen must expect temptations of Satan almost beyond endurance. - Lately, Father O'Shea, I've been wondering what it actually means to be chosen. I don't feel like a priest. I feel like something from another time, like a magician for superstitious people. - An awful lot of people need your magic. Daniel, you could go far in the archdiocese. The cardinal has his eye on you, and you're a bloody poster boy for the church. The runaway street tough who becomes a priest. You come to St. Joseph, a badly run parish, and you turn everything around. - I'm gonna find out who killer her, Father, and when I do- - Yes, just what'll you do? - That I don't know. (somber music) - Were you close to Paula? - Yeah. Childhood friend. I just can't understand it. Can you? - No, I can't understand it at all. Kinda makes you wonder if there's a God. - Yeah, exactly. - My name's Rob. - Alicia, hi. - Are you alone? - I guess you can't turn a street tough into a priest after all. - I'm losing all patience with you, Father Tyrone. I wanna tell you something. The cancer is spreading. I don't have long. All I care about is the church, and the quality of its priests. I can't afford to lose a priest like you, Daniel. Find the murderer if you must. Then, find a way to forgive him. (motorcycle rumbling) (traffic whooshing) (motorcycle putting) - Thanks. You know, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but I had a really good time tonight. I had to get away from all that gloom. - I think Paula would've preferred it that way. - Yeah. Rob? You never told me how you knew Paula. - I painted her once. I didn't know her for very long. - I see. - Goodnight, Alicia. I'll see you again? - Yeah.

Bless me, Father. - Forget it. Did Paula ever mention a guy named Rob? - Yeah, she did. The cops asked me that too. It's Robert, actually, her beau. I never met the guy. He's kinda mysterious, I guess. Why am I telling you this? You're a suspect. - Nicole, I am not a murderer. - So I'm supposed to believe you're innocent just because you wear your collar backwards? - That's up to you. But I need to know what you know about this guy, Robert. - I think she said he came from the Midwest, but that he lived in Bakersfield before he moved down here. - Bakersfield? - Yeah, he's an artist. Very sensitive, you know. - Did she mention his last name? - Sorry. You think he did it, don't you? - I sure would like to talk to him. - [Server] You're up in two, girl. - [Nicole] Hey, now you gotta do something for me. - [Daniel] What? - Watch my act.

You put my brother in the hospital. - Damn it, Elizabeth! My daughter was killed. I was right there, and she died thinking that her father had abandoned her. - No. You never had a daughter. You were a priest, who forgot his vows for one night. I raised her. - You know that I did everything for her that I could. - Well, it wasn't enough. - Okay, okay, it was not enough. And maybe that's why I feel responsible. I wanted to be a father. Why didn't you marry me? - I was afraid. - Of what? - [Elizabeth] Of you.

(Amanda gagging) - I guess we should hang it up, then. (horror music) (motorcycle rumbling) - [Alicia] Wow, these are great. - You think I have half a chance? - God, yes. So real. - Thanks. I seem to see reality pretty clearly. - Do you sell them? - Unfortunately, I might have to. I'd hate to break up the series, though. - Series, what's it called? - I don't know. Maybe I'll call it "Women: You Can't Live with Them." Just kidding. - Would you ever consider painting me? - That wouldn't be such a good idea. I can only paint the dark side of people, and you don't seem to have one. - You make me sound so boring. Wait a minute, you painted Paula. - Yeah. I must've seen something in her. The tragedy she was headed for. - Yeah. Well, think about it. I bet you don't get such offers every day. - No. Not every day. - [Cop] Well, I'm here to talk to you about your visit with the stripper. (Daniel panting) - Her name is Nicole Taylor. - She mentioned you two had a talk. Anything you care to share? - [Daniel] You know as much as I do, Lieutenant. - Actually, I know a little bit more. I got the lab report back on the murder weapon. - Any prints? - Yes, yours. - I'm not a killer, Lieutenant. - Maybe not, but you have gotten into your share of trouble. Two counts of assault on your record, Father. Some drug use. Shocked even me when I read the report. - I was a restless young man once. Don't tell me I'm your only suspect, Lieutenant. - Somebody broke into the apartment of the deceased last night. Any idea who might've done that? - Sorry, I can't help you there. (door creaks) - Pistol packing priest? - The fastest gun in the pulpit. - Let me ask you, Father. Why are you interested in police work? I thought saving souls was your priority. - I'm personally involved in this, Lieutenant. - [Rob] It's summer, it's your off season. What do you expect to lose? - Look, Rob, your new approach is very interesting, but you know what? I'm not crazy about it. You see, that's the problem. - That's because you don't like women. - I don't like the way you depict them. Your work makes the viewer feel, for the lack of a better word, uneasy. - That's the point. You see, I've managed to capture a little passion and pain here, or can't you fucking get it? - Well, I'm afraid passion and pain doesn't mesh well with the walls of corporate executive offices. - Listen, you little, look. Just take a chance on a couple of canvases, okay? - Sorry, Rob. Can't do it. Go back to painting cityscapes. The naked body is out of vogue. (gentle orchestral music) (paint can clatters) (easel clatters) (motorcycle rumbling) (horn honks) - Hey, sweetie. When you gonna ask me back to finish the painting? - I finished it without you. Where the hell have you been? - Relax, I just posed for you. You got 30? You know, if you would just relax you would be a much nicer person. (static crackling) Why don't you get yourself comfortable? - I am comfortable. (static crackling) - [Televangelist] Usurpers of God. In every way, and every place.

I got other customers waiting. - [Televangelist] For the glory of the Father, and strive for the glory of Jesus, hold nothing for those. Thank you. (Daniel grunting) (bag squeaking) (phone dialing) (phone rings) - Yeah, listing in Bakersfield. - Wow, you certainly picked the most desolate spot in the city. I guess I'll have to trust you to act like a gentleman. What is it? - It's you. There are moments when the light hits your face, you're so striking. - Rob, I like you. A lot. But the way I was raised, I'm supposed to be waiting until I get married. This is gonna sound a little old fashioned, but I like the idea. Does that sound stupid? - Not at all. (ominous music) (rooster crows) - I'm sorry you had to drag yourself all the way down here, Father. You must be very busy, what with all the sin in the world. But, I don't know where my son lives. - I'm interested in anything that you can tell me about your son, Mrs. Sorrel. - My son. Well, he's no saint. I can tell ya that. - When did you last see him? - Couple weeks ago, he dropped by. He was undergoing one of his crises. My son is very good at going through crises. He was gonna be a priest once. I should've had him do that, because then he would've had his fill of crises. - I suppose he would have. - Other people's crises. Of course, he doesn't wanna talk to the likes of me. He's an artist, you see. Which means, he paints dirty pictures. Now, you understand, Father, I ordinarily do not let this kind of material into my home. - I understand. When was this done? - Well, not too long ago I'm sorry to tell ya. - Do you know where I would find the model? - You'd have to look in the county morgue. It was in the morning papers. - [Daniel] Excuse me? - She was murdered last night. The police figured a stranger must have picked her up on Highway 99. There it is. Amanda Peterson. Amanda. She always was getting into trouble. In fact, it's just like her to go out and get herself strangled. She's sure got sad eyes, don't you think, Father? - Can I borrow this painting? - It's all I have of Rob's, filthy though it is. - [Daniel] It's very important. - Okay, take it. So, why are you asking me all these questions about Rob? - Mrs. Sorrel, your son may be in some trouble. I won't know until I find him. - Well, I'm not surprised to hear that. - You wouldn't happen to have a photograph of him, would you? - All I have is old ones. - That's fine. ♪ His craft and power are great ♪ - I never should've let him out of this house. But, you gotta let a boy go out in the world. Make his mark, don't you think? - YES. I suppose that's true. (nail gun thudding) (bell ringing) (steam hissing) (door rattles) - I decided I want to pose for you, and I won't take no for an answer. - I told you that's not such a good idea. - Well, maybe you need a change in subject. (fan whirring) (door rattles) (eerie synth music) (woman singing in foreign language) (men shouting) - Hey, sailor. Love that uniform. - Have you ever seen this guy? - Is he the one? - I don't know, I think so. - HEY- Save us some, padre. (people laughing) - Meet me in back. (rock music) - [Alicia] You know, you should do a painting entitled "Scene from a Loft." - I Paint people. I capture their souls with color. That's what the series is all about. - What color is my soul? (fan whirring) - Blue. - Blue? - I think. Best guess I can make without cutting you open to find out. - How do you want me to pose? - [Rob] Sit in the chair. - I don't have to be naked? - I'm not going to paint you like I painted the others. This is simply a gift, for your mom and dad. - How's this? - That's not what I want. Turn into the light. There. (women chattering) - Ladies? Please, excuse me? - Hey, girls, check this out. Any of you seen this guy? - [Woman] No. - No. - Doesn't look familiar. - I know that bastard. He wanted me to pose nude for him once. A real religious psycho. No offense, Father. - None taken. When was this? - About a year ago. He lived down on the Boulevard, up above a porn bookstore. Think it was called Little Shop of Whores. - Did he ever complete the painting? - I never let him start. He was on some kind of really weird trip. You know, in this business, you get a real quick sense about guys like that. - Relax. - God, let me see it. - No. - Mm, touchy. When do I get to see it? - When it's finished. (somber music) Tomorrow, same time? - Yeah. But I'm gonna start charging you. - [Daniel] Appreciate your help. - No problem. You're determined to get this guy, aren't you? - YES. - I know his kind. He's obsessed by the naked female body. - Most men are. - Yeah, but his is a kind of hatred, you know? And everybody knows what a slut deserves, right? - Maybe you should find another line of work. - What, move in with you? - I don't think the church is quite ready for that. (Nicole laughs) - This is the place. (funk music) - Little divine intervention. Yeah? - Yep. - I'm looking for a lost soul, son. You seen this man? - Why do you do this? Customers no like priest in here. - You tell me about Rob Sorrel, and I'm outta here. - I know nothing, please leave. - Are you sure? You don't have any religious periodicals, guns and ammo? - Father, Father, Father. He lived in the lofts upstairs. Deadbeat, no pay rent, gone for weeks. - Did he leave a forwarding address? - Nothing, he no leave last month's rent. Instead, he give me that. - How much you want for it? - How much are you paying? ' $30. - Rent he owe is 300. - 50, no more. - If you leave now, huh? - I leave now.

(brushes clatter) - This has never happened to me before. - I guess I'm a difficult subject, aren't I? I have an idea. - What? - All your other paintings of women have been nudes. - Those paintings are about corruption. - Is the human body corrupt? - The jury's still out on that. - Then let me pose nude for you, Rob. I'll show you you can even paint purity. - No, Alicia. Don't disappoint me. - Just relax, Rob, okay?

Now, he's just another insane artist. - Well, do you have any idea where he might be living? - No, not anymore. You might start looking downtown in the artist district, hm?

Well like I said, she was not a parishioner. But Father Tyrone's behavior was always somewhat unorthodox. And as it now would appear, he's also overly susceptible to temptations of the flesh.

Do the initials DT mean anything to you? - Father Daniel- - Tyrone, yeah. I think we've had enough of this Holy Ghost bullshit. - Bless me Father, for I have sinned. It's been a month since my last confession. - May the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit be in your mind that you may rightly confess your sins. - But first, I need you to do something for me, Father. - What's that? - I need my paintings back, and I need you to leave me the hell alone! - You came here to confess? - Oh yes, I've killed women, Father. It's terrible. But then, something happens. I begin to create beautiful images. Isn't it strange how beauty can come from wickedness? - It won't work. - For these sins and all the sins of my past life, I ask absolution. - I already know what you did. You can't use confession to make me silent. - I came to you to tell my sins to God alone! - You came to me to silence the only witness against you, you murdering little bastard! (haunting choral music) (doors creak) - [Cop] Father Tyrone. - Jefferson. The man that just came out this way is your killer. - What man? - The man that just came out this way. - I didn't see no one leave. Listen, Father, we're gonna need you to clear up a few things. - Goddamn it, Lieutenant! Sorrel was just here. - Father, this isn't easy for me, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to come in for questioning. (police radio crackles) - Clearly, I left them at Paula's. The killer found them, and planted them at the murder scene. - Father, you're the only priest I know with a rap sheet. We hauled in a gang member the other day who said you pulled a gun on him. And to top it off, we find some stolen evidence along with nude paintings of three victims in your bedroom. Now you tell me, what the, what am I supposed to believe? - We've been through this, it's circumstantial. - [Jefferson] Maybe, but there's more. You were in Bakersfield recently. - Well, if that's a crime then I'm guilty. - No, but murder is. The woman you visited is dead. - What? - It happened the day you were there, same MO. Coincidence? - Oh god, who are they? - They're the girls in your paintings, Father. All three killed the same way, strangled with picture hanging wire. The same way Paula Brown was murdered. - Rob Sorrel is an artist. He would have had that kind of wire. - Yeah, well, we've done a background check on this Sorrel. He's been dead for six months. - What? - Suicide. They found his body in the LA river. Where are the wires that's usually attached to the back of those paintings, Father? - The paintings weren't hanging. - No, but you might be. - [Rainy] You know, I didn't know that Sorrel was found dead. - He wasn't. I was just bullshitting. He's been missing for six months. The record suggests suicide. You see, he has a history with several failed attempts. - Now wait a minute, didn't Tyrone say that the mother saw him recently? - Yeah, but the neighbor said the mother was nuts. She imagined her son was with her whenever she went to church. - [Alicia] When I was a little girl, and I went to confession, I'd make everything up. I'd have felt so guilty for not committing any sins, or at least none that I can remember. - There. That's enough for tonight. You're close to being finished. - Well, I can't wait to see it. I know I'm gonna love it. - If you look at it now, you'll be disappointed. Trust me. Ah, that's not such a good idea, either. - Maybe you're right. - I am. - [Alicia] What's wrong, Rob? - What happened to your vow, Alicia? (eerie music) - All this time, I've been waiting for something special and sacred. I don't feel I have to wait any longer. - Well, at least you're honest. Do me a favor? Lock the door. - We're in the middle of nowhere, Rob. - Just, lock the door. (haunting choral music) (Alicia panting) (wings flapping) - [Nicole] You know Father, if they really thought you were guilty, you'd be in jail. - Somehow, that is not a comforting thought. Just, a bit lost. - Yeah, I know you're a priest and all, but are you attracted to me? - More than someone in my position should be. - But not like you were attracted to Paula, right? I mean, you were her lover, weren't you? - Oh no. Come here. Nicole? Paula was my daughter. - What? - The single greatest regret of my life is that she never knew how much I loved her. - You know, they're gonna keep watching us, and following us. - [Alicia] Where are you going? - Wait for me here. I have to go visit a friend. - [Alicia] I wanna go with you. - Just stay here. (door rattles) (fan whirring) (classical music) (people chattering) Long time, Clyde. - Oh, excuse me. Ah, Mr. Sorrel. I don't remember inviting you here. - Easy oversight. By the way, my series is nearly finished. I want you to reconsider. - You must be here because of the priest. - What? - YES. Apparently, Rob, he is your biggest and best fan. Or, you've stopped going to mass. - What priest, Father Tyrone? What did you tell him? (People gasping) - I never lie, Rob. Especially not to a priest. I told him that your paintings were self-indulgent, overrated crap. (people laughing) (Rob chuckles) (Rob yells) (table clatters) (people gasping) - That's okay. - The guy who painted this? He can't even fuck. (People gasping) (glass tinkles) - [Woman] Stay back! - [Man] Let's get out of here. - Should I call the police? - No don't, we don't need the publicity. The little prick. Performance artists. (people laughing) - [Man] Oh that was (laughs). - Guess what, Alicia? (Rob laughs) (ominous music) (Alicia shudders) I guess I was wrong about the color of your soul. The good news is, you'll fit in nicely with the series. I'll be back at seven o'clock. - What? - I have things to take care of. Don't go anywhere. - Rob. - This is important to me. (door rattles) We have to purify ourselves. (door rattles) (ominous music) (somber music) (motorcycle rumbling) - I wanna see both your daughter and Jose, same time Thursday, okay? - Well, I don't know if they will come. - Francine, put the fear of God in them, they'll come. (door creaks) (suspenseful music) - Father Tyrone? Dan? Are you ever home? (ominous music) (Nicole gagging) (glass tinkles) (wings flapping) (somber music) - Father Tyrone. (Monsignor gasps) Mother of God. (phone dialing) There's been a murder. - Bless me Father, for I have sinned. It's been six months since my last confession. Father, I'm only 18 and I did a very stupid thing. I'm not married, but I slept with a man. - The world is full of temptations. - Father, I know. But it was my fault. He's very intense, an artist. He paints me. I don't know. For a while, he made me feel important. Now he makes me feel so dirty. This scares me, Father. - Rob Sorrel? - [Alicia] Yes. Father, how do you know? - God knows many things. Where does he live? - What does that matter, Father? - In God's name, child! Where does he live? - 613 Sixth Street. It's five blocks from here. - You are in danger, stay here. - [Alicia] But Father! - You're absolved. Say 10 hail Marys, and for God's sake, stay here! (ominous music) - What are you doing here? - Rob, you scared me. - Why are you here? - You were right about feeling better after confession. I had to. - Let's go. (door creaks) - Oh, oh. Oh. God. (somber music) - That's him, that's the man! - Hold it right there. (intense music) (engine rumbling) (tires squeal) Stop! (tires squeal) (siren wailing) (police radio crackling) (tires squealing) (tires squealing) (suspenseful music) - What are you doing? Stop it! (sirens wailing) (police radio crackling) (intense music) (tires squealing) (eerie music) (fluid splashing) Rob, please. Don't do this. - Alicia, I do love you. I'll always love you. Everyone waits for the church to save them. Where's the precious church now? (Alicia gasps) - Right here. Rob? You failed to obtain absolution from the almighty and merciful God on your last visit to the confessional. (sirens wailing) - I don't want your worthless absolution! - The chosen must expect temptation almost beyond endurance. - I was never chosen. (tires squeal) - Rob, God chose you. ' No! (gun fires) (Alicia yelps) (both grunting) (gun clatters) (flames roaring) - Run! (both grunting) (cans clattering) - I'm going straight to hell, Father, and I'd hate to make the trip alone. (nail gun whirring) (nail gun thudding) (suspenseful music) (flames roaring) (both groaning) (nail gun thudding) (both groaning) (nail gun thuds) No! (dramatic music) (both grunting) (both panting) - You wanna die! (flames roaring) - Bless me Father, for I have sinned. (flames crackling) (eerie music) - I absolve you in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (flames crackling) (haunting choral music) (sirens wailing) (police radio crackling) (explosions booming) (flames crackling) (somber music) (haunting choral music)
