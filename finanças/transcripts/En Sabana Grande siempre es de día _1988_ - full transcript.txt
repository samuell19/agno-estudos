Someday... ...Your dad. Do You know how things worked with me? I did not know my dad either. And I was thinking about him for a long time. A long, long time! Do you see those photos there?

You know... he drinks too much. Don't you know that he drinks because his bones hurt? didn't you know that he had an accident? No way, he drinks because he is enraged. I was told that every night he grabs a motorbike and i know which one and he rides it right along the cliff. Do you want to see the motorcycle? Fuck the bones! He is enraged because... He could not ride in the championship. What accident?. That was after someone tempered with the breaks in the bike and he plunged over the cliff. That's why he drinks. That's why he does not like to go out with people. Look, he is there, tell him that I was me who threw the rocks, go and tell him that. Dude, let's finish washing the donkeys. Take it, so you can hang it up in your room. It's beautiful. Does your mom know that you're here? No, but it doesn't matter. I do not run away from school anymore...

Wait for the call. OK, what else left to do? You can come in now. With oil or with alcohol? However you decide, especially on the back. What are you doing here? I want to talk to you. About what? We broke up long time ago. About Victor. You have nothing to do with Victor. I found him...actually he found me. He does not need you at all. Because I raised him alone, with a lot of effort. Did he find you? Well, now he's going to know exactly who you are. All the nasty things you did to us. Because you did not want him to be born. Because of your stuff and your damn bike thata was always priority. He did not know anything. But now he is going to know. He does not know that I am his father. I wasn't sure of it myself. Okay, I admit that I was selfish, that I was rough. That I was not involved. But the years gone by and changed us. I've become attached to him... I wnat to hear him, to see him... Besides, if he looked for me, it was because he needed me. Back off or I'll kill you. Ok? BACK OFF! Elizabeth. My son is mine and no one else's, FUCK! I have a surprise for you. What is it? Well, guess... Ok let me guess. They gave you the job of a flight attendant. No. So, someone is going to buy you a car. No. - Ah, I know now, i know. - What? - You got a millionaire who wants to marry you. - Nooooo. What is it, honey? Well, aren't you going to guess? No. - No? - I give up, I give up. OK, tell me then. You know what? you and me...we are going to have a baby. Right now? Well, not now, in eight months. Well, The championship is in eight months. Well and... No way... Did not you tell that you were taking the pills? Well, yes but i forgot. Ahhh! you forgot. Do you know what I think? That you did it on purpose. Get on. I told you to get on the bike! Stop! STOP! What do you want?, Do you want me to abort? QUICO! What's wrong? are you OK? Listen to me, honey. Once the championship is over, we can have a baby, OK? What is going on? Leave me alone, OK? You got what you wanted. Me too. Elizabeth, come here. So you are not going to talk to me? You're not going to talk to me huh!? Are you insane? Is your mom pretty? Yes, but she has a really bitchy temperament. If she falls in love with Quico, surely you will not go to boarding school. Do you think they could fall in love? Of course I do, dude. Quico is a good guy. And he has a motorcycle. And all the women in this world loves motorcycles. Do you think my mom is a whore? I do not know dude, but that place where your mom works... Doesn't look good. Do whores falls in love? Sometimes. I've seen some next to a jukebox crying hard. Are there jukeboxes where your mom works? There he comes. He doesn't look like one in love. Did you meet her? Quico, did you meet her? she is pretty, isn't she? Yes. Has she seen your bike? Why your clothes are always in a mess? Did she give you the massage? No. Your mom is a great woman, OK? And she loves you. She is waiting for you. Have you two become friends? It is not so simple. She didn't see your bike, right? Look... That's for you. For me? Yes, for a memory. Do you know what, boy? I love you. I love so much, so bloody much! Because you are smart. And a little bit crazy too. No man, you're crazier than me. Do you know, Victor? You deserve to grow up healthy, with no problems. Did she blame you for my coming to the park so often? No. I'm who does not want to. It's me who doesn't want you to come to the park anymore. Not even once a week? Not even once a month? Damn it! Go home! What's the story? Did he say "yes"? Well, this is a tough situation. You know that getting a place in a boarding school is not so easy. Well, do you really see it that hard? Well, I think that if you had gone in person you would have got the place. Well, why do not you come with me then? Run Victor, run! What's going on? Why hurry? Look look, and you'll see. What's up? what's up!? About Quico and your mom. What's wrong with Quico? Well, Quico is broke. Broke? You are so educated. Quico has no money to satisfy your mom. Look at her. Now the girl finishes her make up, looking in the mirror. While waiting for the guy. Hears the horn and approaches the car. The guy asks: which hotel are we going to, honey? And the girl answeres: I will guide you. She hopps in, the guy grabs her arse and she gets tickles. What a car! What's wrong? Are you crying? Because of your mom? Your mom loves you. You have toys, food, house, fine clothes. Come, I'll take you home. No no, I don't want to go home. Where are you going to stay? on the street? Yes, on the street. You do not know how dangerous streets are, boy. I want to go with you. Where? to the park? No, to your house. Which house? the Country Club or Lagunitas's one? Come. This is my home. This is where you are going to sleep. Don't be afraid. If someone comes here and mess with us, I'll stab him. I'll show you how to use this. First you need some agility. Be alert. You deceive him. What's wrong? I have a headache. You are nervous. You'll see how I'm going to cure you. - Take it. - No, I've never smoked. Take it. No. And this is glue? Have you ever smelt glue? Do you have a child aspirin? No boy, I'm going to cure you quicker. Move over there. Inhale. What is it? Inhale and shut up. One of my cousins... Swallowed it, then he lit a cigarette and burned his guts inside. What's going on? It is a ghost. Run Victor, they are thefts . Look at them Perro Covero... They are fresh meat, Get them, dude. GET THEM! Run Victor! take the other ladder. Elizabeth. Dude, she gave you a nusty look. No problem, It doesn't matter. I think, he passed away. Don't say that Cara e' brocha. Well...I saw him falling down, you didn't. Even the thugs freaked out. Do not be a fool, boy. I saw him all broken. Look Cara e' brocha. Do you know what? That boy will survive. Did you hear me? He will survive! He is going to make it. How is he? Leave us alone, OK? Once and for all. What is it? I'm leaving, boy. Are you leaving Caracas? Yes. To Margarita? I'm sick of this park, I'm sick of that Turk, I'm fed up with Caracas. No boy, I'm moving to Margarita. Besides... I have never been more than three months at one given place. What about Victor? He is better, isn't he? It is in stable condition. Are you leaving him now? I do not like to be on the way of anybody's child. Besides, he has his mom, right? What about your family? No father or mother? And papers? What papers? Well, ID, birth certificate, all that. It doesn't matter, I already know where I was born and on what day. And if they ask you for them? I got my ways. Do you want to come with me? Yes. Really? Really? Sure man, no problem if with you. Well, let's do this right now. let's do it. Look what I stole for you. Now you have a really big scar. Now we won't be able to call you "four stitches" anymore. I remember nothing. You passed out. Did I? I thought I was going to die. No. I knew you were not going to die. Quico says that when you want something badly you do not die until you get it. And he knows it? Yeah, sure. Do you think he still loves me? Who? Quico? He gave you his blood, he gave a liter of it. Why doesn’t he come to see me then? Look dude, your mom does not like you to be with us. Aha, you think you're so smart, right? Leave him alone, he is my best friend. And your best friend does not know how to read the door signs ah? Look honey, it's the best for you... I don't want people to visit you so you can recover, OK? Come with me, let's go. Do not worry dude, I'm tired of being kicked around everywhere. Bye bye. Bye. You look just fine... You look as if nothing happened. Do you know what we do when this will be over? We are going to the beach. To the beach? To the beach, honey. To get rest, to take up the sun... - Far away from here, just the two of us. - I don't want to go to the beach. Why don't you want toa go to the beach? Look, the doctor recommended it. And those flowers? They were given to me. By whom? My a friend. Your friend from the park? Yes. Did he come here and talked with you? Of course. You do not like my friends, do you? NO! Honey... I want only the best for you. Do you think I can like that kind of people around you? Do you know them? Do you know if they have diseases? If they are in drugs? Do you know all this? Look mom, they do not have diseases nor they're on drugs. How would you know? - Because I know them. - Really? Quico gave blood for me. - Blood? - Yes.... For me. Over a liter of it. Well... When you recover, we will talk about it. But one never knows... I know! What do you know? I know everything. What do you know about them? I know everything and all about you as well. About me? What do you know about me? You do not go to a college. Hey, how can you say that I'm not going to college? Yes, you do not go to the college and you hang out with men. Who said you that? Nobody, I've seen it myself. Honey... How can you tell me such things? You are the most important thing to me. You are the one I love the most in the world. I love them too. I am already 10 y.o. and learnt that everything I've heard from you are lies. And because of you, I do not even know my dad. Get off boy, get off. Stay way, far away. What are you going to do? I'm going to throw this pice of shit away, dude. Throw it? You're insane. That worth a lot of money. The most important thing is what we have inside. Let's go. Excuse me Sir.. Does a man by the name Quico works here? used to work... Used to work? Yes, he used to work. Well, legally he still works here but... Do you think it's fair that someone should quit all this without... Suddenly?. Look, those riders are... Crazy people, they are jumping and jumping everywhere. Where did he go? Do you know? I don't know! he's just left. He thinks that life is about motocross tracks. Sir, can you tell me where I can find him? Are you going after that crazy man, girl? - Well, sir... - Look, just a moment, look. He left to Margarita half an hour ago, if you get a taxi now... And go to the airport - You pull him by the ear like this and bring him back to me. - Are you sure? - Sure, lady. Well, thank you very much. At your service. Taxi! Hurry up. OK, let's go. Any lagage?
