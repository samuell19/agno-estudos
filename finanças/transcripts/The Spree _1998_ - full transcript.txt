Nice place. -[man] Filipino, right? -Actually, half Filipino half Samoan, [man] Mmm-hmm. You know, I've had dates with over 50 nationalities. [woman] The UN needs more like you. [man] Equal opportunity fucking. That'll be my platform. [woman] Oh! Oh, hold on, hon. Your friend there needs a raincoat. Okay, I'll be back in a minute. [man humming] [man urinating and humming] -[sighs] -[water flushes] [man humming] [man] Hey, I'm gonna take a quick shower. You wanna join me? [woman] No, thanks. I don't like to get wet. [man humming] [telephone ringing] Oh, fuck. Hello. Hello? Nice. [security alarm beeping] [man] Who's there? Call 911. What, are you crazy? Me call the cops? [alarm continues beeping] [dog barking in distance] [man] All right, you son of a bitch! Come and get it. [alarm continues beeping] [officer] Xenia Kelly? [horn blaring] [indistinct announcement] Brought him in an hour ago. He was asking for you before he went under. Where'd you find him? In an alley. Drunk. Pretty nearly asphyxiated on his vomit. I'm very sorry. The nurse was asking if you'd be, you know, making the arrangements with the hospital. Me? [chuckles softly] Arrangements? You know what, you just say three Hail Marys and then pull the plug. [Xenia] You're wasting a good candle. -[door closes] -He is your father. Piece of shit. You're more like him than you know. Thanks. That's really what I needed to hear, mommy. Look, I... I can't stay. I just... This is crazy. I just came here to give you this. -It's too much. -Just take it. I got a new job. -It's a big landscape consultation. -No. No. No, no, no, no. [Xenia] What are you doing? Mommy, what are you doing? I am going to the hospital. He falls out of the sky after 20 years and you want to go see him? I should be there. Come with me. There's not enough money in the world. I'm sorry. Where you going? Out. To a bar. To have a drink. What dear old dad would do, isn't it? [upbeat music playing] ♪ Only one man, baby -Hey, white boy. -Hey. Come on. Hey, Mamma Mia. What's up? I just quit smoking. Oh, I'm proud of you, Xenia. My father turned up. He left when I was five. Then one day I'm eight, he shows up, takes me to the zoo. And all day, all day, I'm working up the courage, you know, to ask him if he's gonna come visit me again. You know what he says to me? He says, "Don't expect me to be some kind of Disneyland dad." That's cold. Oh, shit. I need to dance. Come dance with me. In my dreams I'd dance with you, Xenia, here, I'm the bartender. [men chattering] ♪ Attraction [laughter] ♪ Oh, I just wanna be mean to you Give me the night ♪ ♪ To show you sweet love Give me the night ♪ ♪ Make love to... -I don't like to dance alone. -Huh. I don't like to dance at all. Well, you can never trust a man who doesn't like to dance. Nobody said you were supposed to trust me. ♪ Oh, girl ♪ Take me ♪ Mmm, Give me the night [chatter] ♪ Give me, give me, give me ♪ Give me the night ♪ Give me the night ♪ To show you sweet love ♪ Give me the night ♪ Let me love you up All through the night ♪ [crowd cheering and clapping] -[woman] All right! -[man whooping] See you around. [Latin American music playing] Hey, I don't know what happened to my wallet. Uh, I can leave my watch while I go get some money. What do I need with a goddamn watch? Well, what do you want me to do? Wash the dishes? Please put it on my tab, it's okay. I can take care of this myself. [bartender] You can't take care of it yourself. So say thank you to the lady. If you want, you can leave me your watch. Thanks, I appreciate it. I got to say I've been having a bad night. Would you like another drink? [chattering] Maybe some other time. [car starting] [Xenia] Hey! Cowboy! Your bad night just got better. Well, how about that. [car engine stops] So where'd you find it? I didn't find it. There's a couple of wise guys in there, if you know what to look for. -Oh. yeah? -Mmm-hmm. What I owe you for those drinks? You're insulting me. I'm Xenia Kelly. Garden consultant. I do a quarterly, Pacific Native Garden. I'm sure you've seen it. Uh... -Pacific Native Garden? -Mmm-hmm. Very nice. [laughs] Oh, wait, no, no. no, no, no. Now, this is where you're supposed to tell me something about yourself. Bram Hatcher. I'm a rancher. Horses? Snakes. Snakes? Yeah. I, uh, breed and sell them to pet shops mostly. I got a couple of acres up at Fraser Cove. Well, I should've guessed you'd be into something weird. [chuckles softly] I always liked reptiles. So you like snakes better than people? On a bad day. You know... You never did tell me why it was such a bad night. [chuckles softly] It's not anymore. [car starting] [Ray] Yeah, I'll come see you next Sunday, I promise you. [dogs barking] Okay, I gotta go. Yeah, I gotta go. mom. Okay? I gotta go. Yeah, I'll call you later. Bye. -[knocking at door] -[dogs barking] Come on. Come on, Come on, come on, come on. Inside. Jesus Christ, get the dogs fixed. [man] Great. Now you want me to emasculate my dogs? Go and get them laid. They're too excitable. [sighs] Right. They're guard dogs. Will you ever consider an alarm system? Like the kind you so confidently disarm? Listen, my dogs are not just ordinary dogs, you know. They're Egyptian Pharaoh Hounds. Otherwise known as the Ibicenco. They have been pure-bred since 3000 BC. Ray, those dogs aren't even the same breed. Yeah, well, Molly. Molly is a bit of a stray, but, you know, she has the heart of an Ibicenco. [laughs] Man, you're so full of shit. Five for the pearls. Five? Do you know what those go for at Bulgari's? They're rare. Makes them hard to move. Check out the diamonds. Derco. Shame to break up the settings. Some of these are scratched. Fuck you, Ray. Probably when you took them out. Look, I know how to handle stones. If they're scratched, then that's the way I got them. [smacks lips] Seven. -Twelve. -Eight. Don't treat me like a junkie, Ray. Eight five. And that is the best I can do. That is more than 20%. [chuckles softly] 20%. Twenty-percent. That's the story of my life. And what do I got to do to get a 100? [chuckles softly] You know, you should... You should get out of this crap. You know, you should go back to lumberjack state or wherever it was, and just read books about kings. "True hope is swift, and flies as swallow's wings..." I don't remember. [chuckles] "Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures..." "...Kings." Right. See what I mean? That just comes out of you. It's incredible, you could do so much better. So could you, Xi. [birds chirping] [door creaking] [crow cawing] [Xenia] Hello, snake rancher. I'm looking for a Suriname Red Tail Boa. Very exotic. Hard to find. Yeah, well, I hear they run like crazy from people. Well, some breeds handle Homo Sapiens better than others. How did you find me? I asked around the snake grapevine. There's not that many of you. Well, I'm not going to ask how you got in. Front door. Ooh. -Left it open, huh? -Hm. Ha! How silly of me. So, do you do this often? What? Just walk into men's houses. No, I just wanted to see a snake ranch. [glasses clink] [Xenia] They look happy. Yeah. You, uh, give them food, shelter, warmth... Maybe even some love? [laughs] Snakes don't need a lot. Too bad you can't say the same thing about people. [Bram] This is a Burmese python. [chuckles nervously] [chuckles softly] You didn't strike me as a squeamish type. No? How do I strike you? Barbed wire with perfume. Sometimes I'm scared shitless. Well, fear's just nature's way of making you smart. Come on, buddy. So why did you come? I just wanted to know the truth I guess. And? I haven't decided. Ah, so it doesn't matter what I say. Well, it never matters what people say. It's what they do. So... If I wanted you to leave... [ice tray cracking] ...how do I get you out? You could call the police. [Bram laughs] Or you could just tell me that you want me to leave and I'll leave. [glasses clinking] I didn't say that... I want you to leave. You didn't say anything. [Bram] Do I have to say? Tell me that you don't want me. I didn't say. I didn't want you here. [Xenia] Tell me that you don't want me. [Bram] I didn't say I didn't want you. [Xenia] Tell me that... Tell me... [breathing heavily] [gasps] [suspenseful music playing] [clicks] [dramatic music playing] [metal clinks] So these rated for half-inch steel cable? Oh, you bet. It's got a ten-year guarantee. You're looking at the best. [cell phone ringing] Hello. [Bram on phone] What do you wear? Nothing. When can I see you? When do you want to see me? Now. -Uh... -[honking] Running some errands? Can you hang on a second? And where are you? Oh, I'm out about. I miss you bad. How bad? Real bad. I lie down, I smell you on the pillow. Then change the sheets. I feel your hands on me when I wake up at night. Take a shower. Oh, I need to wash off. Look, I'm busy tonight. Do you think you can defer some gratification? Oh, well, no, no, I'm bad at that. Tomorrow. How about a picnic? Sounds perfect. I'll make it worth your wait. [instrumental music playing] [Xenia] First the Indians, then the settlers. and then the rich people. [Bram] That's the deal. People hang on to things until somebody rips them off. I thought this was supposed to be a picnic. It is. A very special little picnic. [security alarm beeping] [keypad beeping] What is it, Xenia? This is Cassie Michael's house. -She asked me to cat sit. -Oh. Like to meet Cassie sometime. Well, she's in Portland for a few days. She just called me and asked me to feed the cat and water the plants. It's Mayan Snake God, Chac. It's worth fifty thou, give or take. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. -[cat meowing] -Hello, you. You hungry? Hm? You hungry? So this was a good idea, huh? So how did you meet Cassie? We're getting our legs waxed. [chuckles] They're pouring this hot gunk all over us, you know, and Cassie turns to me and she says, "Maybe you can save my evening primrose." Well, then the wax starts to harden and she wants to hold my hand because she's scared. I don't know, there's something, something about pain, you know, even... stupid girly pain like that. Anyway, afterwards she had me do her entire garden. She has the most beautiful evening primrose. Did you know that evening primrose only blooms at night? Nothing but the best for girl Cassie, huh? [Xenia] Hm. [glasses clink] Hey, Colin. Hey, Brammy. Hey, buddy, wait up. Hey, check this out. Last night, some guy steals a pink Merc. -Now, who the fuck would steal a pink car, huh? -[laughs] Oh, man, drugs, cops. We all getting done. Yeah, it's the lead, man. in the air. Things were a whole lot simpler ten years ago. Ah, you're missing the uniform. I don't miss the uniform. But I liked it when we were partners, you know? [Bram] Yeah, me too. [chatter] [telephone ringing] [dramatic music playing] [indistinct announcement] [chatter] [honking] -[Colin] Hey, Bram. -Colin. Mind if, uh, I look around? Might be related to something I've been working on. Sure. We got a guy and a gal gardening across the street saw them. Walks in, polish off a $300 bottle of champagne and the caviar. Lifts some priceless pre-Colombian gizmo and three hundred fifty grand worth of stones. -Jesus Christ. -Can you believe it? The woman kept her jewelry in the fucking deep freeze. Read an article somewhere that said it would survive a fire. -Forcible injury? -Uh-uh. Maid was fired last week. Took off to Guadalajara. The perp had a key, alarm goes. knew the occupants were out of town. Help yourself. [officers chattering] [camera shutter clicking] -[officer] Yeah, I guess it's temporary. -[camera shutter clicking] [officer chattering] [Colin] Bram, what the fuck? What the fuck are you doing, man? I never had $300 champagne. Man, I got enough problems without you mixing your prints in. I'd have you arrested. Yeah, you know, I've been doing dumb shit like that all day. You know, it's the lead, right? Okay, I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Look, I'll get out of your hair. It's not my guy's style anyway, right? Forget about it. [sighs] [siren wailing in distance] [man] You don't worry. I'll go check. Good evening. [instrumental music playing] [siren blaring] You gonna bust me, Bram, you better wait till you can find more in my car than a spare tire and a bottle of Obsession. Get your dirty cop hands off of me! You have a very interesting investigative style, don't you? Ever occur to you that I didn't want to make this arrest? Yeah, right. You just happened to meet a woman in a bar, and what a coincidence, she's a crook and you're a cop, and you just happen to have a fucking book on her? I mean, come on. Opposites attract, but that strikes me as a slight compatibility problem. Xenia, I was at that bar because your car was spotted near a robbery a couple of months ago, okay? I was backgrounding you, all right? How the hell did I know you were gonna come in? When you did, well... I was attracted to you, all right? Hey. Hey! I tried to bail. You hunted me up, remember? -After that... -Yeah, and after that, you developed a little conflict of interest. Is that fair? Yeah, well, you could safely say I forfeited my case. Yeah. And what does that mean? It means you just committed grand larceny and I don't give a damn. I don't want us to end. And what makes you think this isn't already over? Look, I'm still a cop, okay? All I ask is that you don't rub my face in it. When we're together, if we're together, that... Just leave out the part about how we earn our daily bread. So I just keep my mouth shut and go on being acrobatic in bed, and I don't have to worry? That's not what I said! Look, you know, I am not exactly what you would call an upstanding citizen. All right? I routinely break six out of the ten commandments, -but I've got... -You told me you were a garden consultant! That's all I want to know! Here's your goddamn file. I never turned it in. Nobody downtown knows you exist. You play kinda fast and loose, don't you? Ever since I met you, yeah. Then I guess I haven't been very good for you, then, have I? Maybe been too good. Hey, the world's full of rules. In the end, you got to answer to yourself. [breathing heavily] What if they found out? I'll be suspended, probably fired. [both breathing heavily] [chattering] Here you go. Lettuce and something. [sighs] How come every day these things look worse? I don't know, man, because they are. That Verdugo job. Anything come in? Yeah. They find your prints all over the goddamn place. Besides me. Well, a lovely couple had loved practice along with their champagne. [laughs] Made themselves right at home. Yeah, sounds like fun. Oh, yeah. You're telling me. Anything else? What do you mean "anything else"? Yeah. A whole group of extraterrestrials came in this morning and confessed. "Anything else." That the hell are you talking about? What do you care? Yeah, yeah. Hey! My new tie. [Xenia breathing heavily] [exhales loudly] Mm. What is the matter with you? I think I am bored with the country life. You can't... You can't spend a whole day potting, watering damn plants. Yeah, well... [grunts] [straining] Read a book or something. I don't like sitting around. I want to... I want to move. I want to go somewhere. I mean, dance. I mean, you didn't have a radio in there. Do you have a radio? No, I don't think so. -So you want to dance? -Yeah, I wanna dance. Huh? Well, come here. -How about this? -[Xenia laughs] What the hell is that? Oh, some kind of strange two-step. -Do you mind? -No, I mean like... You know, escape velocity? -You ever heard of that? -No. It's the speed that, um, that a rocket needs to get beyond gravity. Well, I want to go that fast sometimes. Oh, is that why you steal? So you could go fast? Escape? -No, I steal because I'm good at it. -Well... I mean, why are you a cop? Good question. Well, I thought it was because you liked being a good guy. Well, every cop likes being in a good guy. You know... Good and bad, they're just concepts of the system that fell apart a long time ago. [Bram] I'll tell you a story. A couple years ago, I'm up for a promotion. And I catch this guy with a hot stereo. Now he's living in this... crap hole of a van with the wife, couple kids. The guy, he's so scared he can't even talk. But the wife, she is begging me to let him go. So I tell them... [straining] just keep the damn stereo and get out of town. The next day, he is busted for crack. -Mm. [laughs] -And he's wailing for me. Mr. Mercy. Next thing I know, I'm on probation in this asshole I trained is my boss. Mm. And look at you now. And now you're having an illicit love affair with a crook. Now you're spending all your time slinking around in secret. All right, all right. I know you're restless. Are you hungry? Yes. [Xenia] I was 17 and his name was Constantine Alexakos. But everybody called him "Connie". And he did, he did a lot of second-story work. And I used to always ask him if I could go with him, and he would always, always tell me no. Until finally, one day I got to him. I'll not tell you how I got to him. -All right. -I really got to him. And after that first house, I thought... this is it. But his specialty was safes. One day we were doing this big old Schneider. You know, which... The tumbler's the size of a dinner plate, and this piece of C-4 went off in his hand. I mean, I'm standing there and I'm watching him, and it's like... Boom! And all this blood is spurting and his index finger is just gone. -And then, we spent... -[both laugh] We spent the next five minutes looking for it. -[laughs] -Not to save it. You know, but because it had his print on it. -[Bram chuckles] -I... I don't do safes anymore. My favorite public servant! My favorite public ass. Ricky Madden. Xenia Kelly. -You're not really going out with this guy... -Yes, I am. Now, Madden, be civil, just shut up and get out of here. What do you do, Mr. Madden? Well, he's a lawyer. -A criminal... lawyer. -[both laughing] Well, you know, you don't look like a lawyer. Well, thank you. I don't really think of myself as one. Now, isn't that right, Mr. Hatcher? See, um, along the way, some of his beach body has got caught up in the dope he is. Now, you're the one that keeps him riding the waves, aren't you? You know, Xenia, it's tough being a cop. You watch people break the law and get away with it. Watch him get rich... Get your goddamn hands off her. ...bust your ass and come up empty. -But then... -I said, get your hands off. Detective Hatcher'd like to think of himself as arctic white. But could it be, he's a couple of notches down on the grays... -[man 1] Hey, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. -[man 2] What's going on? [both grunting] [gun cocks] [Ricky] Be careful, Brammy boy. Be very, very careful. All right, folks, I hate to break this up, but who'll be taking care of this check? I think this one's on you, Mr. Madden. [Ricky chuckles softly] [thunder rumbling] [Bram] Come back. I can't sleep without you anymore. I wake up. [Xenia] I gotta go. Is this a job? We don't discuss business, remember? You want to come with me, don't you? Hm? What, are you bored up there? All right, hot stuff. Teach me. I work alone. Well... -You said that I'd be good. -Yeah, I said you would be good at it. I didn't say that I wanted a partner. [Bram] Why? [Xenia] Well, because sooner or later, they let you down. I don't want to be your partner. I wanna be your student. You had Connie. Let me have you. So you wanna learn how to be a thief? Hm? You wanna learn how the... case prospects and... the security systems, tell real from fakes? Risk getting shot? -[breathing heavily] -Hm? You wanna do that again? [Bram moans] What if we get caught? [straining] You willing to do time? -Huh? -[grunts softly] Are you willing, in your heart of hearts, to cross over? Huh? [instrumental music playing] [ominous music playing] [bottle rattling] [objects clattering] [car approaching] Let's go. [indistinct murmurs] [grunts] [gun cocking] [gun cocking] Don't move, asshole, or I'll fucking kill you! Drop it, now! On your knees. I said, on your knees, Get down on the fucking floor! You alone? Who else is here? Answer me, damn it! Talk to me, motherfucker! Or you're dead. You want to fuck with me, asshole? I'll blow your fucking head off! [gunshot] Hey. If you're out there, we need an ambulance on Elmont. [police 1] Two peeps. Through the back door! [police 2] All right, I got it, I got it! [police 1] Through here, up here! [both grunting] [sirens approaching] [Xenia] Oh, God. He'll be okay. You got him in the shoulder. Your partner? Your fucking partner? He used to be before I made detective. Shit, I never shot a man. Jesus God, a fucking cop. But nobody knew you were there. He didn't fucking see ya. He saw me. He's got brown eyes, right? Well, his brown eyes looked into mine and he saw me. Listen to me. There's no way he could ID you. The sun was blasting in behind you. You saw him, he didn't see you. We're gonna lay low on ride this thing out. Bram, there are gonna be cops crawling all over the fucking place. You know, they all get a fucking heart attack when somebody shoots a cop, like cops matter more than anybody else. -We do. -Oh, "we". That's a hot one. Look, I'll monitor the police bands. I'll see how bad things really are. As soon as word's had a chance to get out, I'll look in on Colin at the hospital. I'm coming too. Are you out of your fucking mind? Look, I shot a man. The least I can do is have the balls to go see him. Xenia, you do something crazy like that, you're gonna fuck us up. Now, just relax, have a few beers, take a warm bath. Oh, you think a fucking bubble bath is gonna fix this? Just sit tight, all right? [ship horn blaring] [groaning] I tell you, buddy. it was worth to get shot at. That night, nurse babe catheterized me. I get a hard on just thinking about her putting on them rubber gloves. [Colin laughs] -[Bram clears throat] -Huh? -And this is... -Xenia. -And you're Colin. -I am. I'm sorry we have to meet under these circumstances. Don't. I'll be happy to meet you under any circumstances. You know, I had a feeling there was something he wasn't telling me. Work with a guy for ten years, you know when he's holding out on you. I brought you some medicine. Hey-hey! Where'd you find this girl? She found me. I was minding my own goddamn business. So did they catch who did it? Well, we, uh, we know we're looking for a lady. Really? -Yeah. -What kind of lady? I don't know. I didn't get a good look at her, But she was young, and a fox, almost as pretty as you. Oh, maybe I should rob some houses. I could use the money. [Colin laughs] It was weird, you know, this guy was, It's like, he knew what I was gonna do before I did. When you ever heard of a guy look away when you're pointing a gun at him, huh? Must not have been his first bust, huh? Yeah. [groans softly] You better call Florence Nightingale, I need some more drugs. [indistinct chatter over PA] What the fuck is the matter with you? Fuck! It was a test that he flunked, okay? How do you know that? I don't know that. I think that, all right? It doesn't matter. Are you fucking suicidal? I mean, I'm doing everything I can to keep our asses out of the slammer, and you go making a cameo appearance before the only goddamn witness. You just can't stay away from fucking flame, can you? Come on. I thought you were some kind of tough bitch, huh. What's that, some kind of compliment? Look, it is just his shoulder. It is not gonna fuck up his life. And who're you to say what's gonna fuck up somebody's life? Look, just go home, dammit. Huh? You nervous or something? Lay low, all right? [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello. [Bram] What are you wearing? Nothing. I miss you. What are you doing? I'm getting the tools out of the house. I rented a storage locker. Don't think it hurts to be too careful [man knocking at door] Hello! C-Can I call you back? -Hello? -[door opens and closes] [Colin] Hi. Hi. It was unlocked. -It was? -Yeah. You should be more careful. Oh, my God. What are you doing out of bed? I just got a couple extra holes in me, that's all. I thought I'd stop by and, uh, thank you for the flowers You're welcome. -I just need these for driving. -Oh. Well, this is nice. Thank you. Yeah. Bram tells me you're in the flower business. -Uh, well, garden consulting. -Uh-huh. Did you catch that, lady thief? No, not yet, but we will. Listen, Xenia, there's something I got to ask you. The day I got shot, according to the police report, there's a car like yours spotted near the scene. Really? Where? Body Bay Road, around 4 o'clock Thursday afternoon. Hmm. Well, I go up there sometimes, but not last Thursday. Oh, oh. We didn't have any license plates. Just, uh, you know, one of them dealer things you get when they're new, you know Listen, Xenia, You were once convicted of passing bad checks, weren't you? I was eighteen. I got a suspended sentence. You make a lot of money telling people what to plan. Are you serious? Hey, look, because you've got a record, I gotta ask, right? Right, you're serious. aren't you? You're serious. I was young, and I made a mistake. And as you can see, I got myself straightened out. Okay? Okay. Might I have have a look around? Yes, I... Yes, I do. I do mind. Well, uh, here's my number. In case anything comes up you want to tell me. -All right. -All right? -How dare you! -What? You know what! Hey! Bram! A car like hers was spotted near the scene, and she has a criminal record. You know that? Of course I know that. What are you, fucking sixteen or something? Hey, what the hell's the matter with you, man? It's routine, Bram. You know that. You'd have done the same thing yourself. Let me tell you something as a friend. Before stepping out, I checked for quicksand, mister. Colin, I love this girl. You say a fucking word against her without having something solid, you do anything that hurts her, So help me God, man... So help me God. He died this morning Mummy, why are you doing this? -Mummy, what are you doing? -I belong here. He left you. He left us. He was a very proud man. He didn't want us to know how bad off he was. He always sent us money when he could. [scoffs] I was a good wife. Mummy... You're not still married to him. I told everybody we were divorced. It was easier. It was easier on you. [groans softly] Xenia, he's still your father And you better learn to love him the best way that you can. [sobbing] [inhales] [car approaching] Hi. What's wrong? Nothing. My father died I'm sorry It's gonna be a funeral? No, thank God. I spent the day talking my mother out of it. Instead, she'll get a little urn of his ashes to obsess over for the rest of her life Bram, I thought you said you were gonna get rid of this. I told you to dump the fucking gun. I am going to. -You're getting sloppy. -Xenia. Colin is looking for his shooter. I know him. He is not going to let up. I'm going to help him find her. As soon as I can, I'm gonna slip the gun into the evidence lockup hanging on some cute little gang girl corpse. Colin gets his lady, case closed. Gonna stick a shooting I did on some dead person? -Gets calling off our backs. -No. This is not a good time to discuss this. You're still thinking like a cop. You think you can do whatever the fuck you want. "Some dumb shit crackhead. What the fuck does she matter." -Is that how you think -You know why you don't like it? Because it's not down to the letter, exactly what you've been doing for your ten glorious years of crime? "It's not the book," according to convict. That's right. I had a way of doing things, and it worked Xenia. Come on, hey, hey. We're fucking up. We're starting to fuck up. No, we're not. We're getting out, we're gonna go someplace else to start over. We don't have enough. It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. I don't want to live like my mother, and I don't want to die like my father [Bram] We need somebody filthy rich. It's got to be new money. [Xenia] Yeah, somebody who hasn't learned how to take care of it yet. Yeah, like, uh, dealer, bag man or something. What about, uh, Nah. Come on, who? Nah, forget it. No, come on. We have to think of every possibility. Just think about maybe Ricky Madden. That obnoxious guy at the restaurant? Yeah. He scrubs money, right? He's perfect. Forget it. We tried to get a bug into his house a couple of years ago, it's like Fort Knox Except... I think maybe he moved. Come on, he's such an ass. I'd love to hit him just on general principle. Come on, Xenia. He's got a new place. It'll be tougher than his old one. Unless he's still getting moved in [Bram] So what's the entry point? Skylight? [Xenia] It's probably late. But maybe the system's not all hooked up yet. Yeah, because maybe there's nothing in there to steal yet. Yeah, but suppose there is, you don't put up an electric wire unless you got something to protect. [Bram] Slow down a little bit, will you? This place is built with drug money. That just means that Madden can't report the theft. It also means that man's friends are serious people. The cops get you, you do time. Madden's friends get you, you're dead. I got you. I could live without whatever's in there. I can't. I want it as bad as I want you. [Bram] We're gonna need information. All right, my gut tells me it's a Sapphire security system. The usual lace job plus passive infrared. If that's up and running, we're fucked. I can do it. Oh, come on. You can't go near one of those things. I said I can do it. Yeah, well, all right, let's say you can. He keeps his money in a wall safe. Guy said it's one of those big custom Moslers, that moves the money every day or two. On the other hand, his pattern's consistent. Makes his calls from a pay phone. Goes to that restaurant every afternoon about 4:00. Drinks, has dinner and stays until about 9:00. -Ready? -Go. [Xenia] One, two, three. [alarm beeping] [beeping continues] [beeping stops] [alarm beeping] [grunts] [sizzling] No keys. That would have been too easy. who Don't worry, it won't explode... yet. -Ready? -Mmm-hmm. [drilling] [drilling noise continues] [lock disengages] [drilling noise stops] Xenia, you have done this before, right? Yeah, with Connie. Like Connie was there while you did it. Like Connie was there when I was watching him. Jesus Christ. Bram, you're disturbing my concentration [ticking] -Get going. -You're gonna be okay? Yeah. You meet pretty women in the most unexpected places. You'll forgive me. I've forgotten your name. Xenia. Last time we met, Xenia, you were with a guy. Bram Hatcher, officer of the law. I'm glad this time you're by yourself. Don't disappoint me and tell me he's here too. I work alone. This isn't a social call. If you get that gun out of my face, then maybe we could chat. I feel naked without it. Of course, it's not a bad thing with a girl that looks like you. -I'm not armed. -That is stupid. I call you a woman in jeopardy. Is that a prelude to a rape that I can't report? No. That'd ruin my story. That I killed an intruder in self defense [gunshot] [screams] [hyperventilating] This is one time you can thank me for bringing a gun. [bell ringing] [alarm ringing] That's it, come on, let's go. [tires squealing] -Oh, my God. -Xenia? -Bram, I think I'm gonna be sick. -Xenia! -Xenia! -Oh, God! He's dead, he's dead. I got to go back to the station. tie up loose ends, huh? No, I can't be alone. Please, I don't wanna be alone. Please, please. I need to feel you next to me, please. Fuck me. -Yeah? -Yeah. [Xenia] I shouldn't have dragged you into this. You were a cop, you know. You were, you were a good cop, and I just, I made you dirty. Hey. We're in this together. All the way. Let's go home, get your passport, leave you at the airport at dawn. We'll take the first flight out of the country. -God. -Xenia... I'm sorry. -Hey. -I love you. -Hey. -I love you. [footsteps approaching] [Colin] Hello, Xenia. You know, some of this is very interesting. Harvesting purple prairie cornflower seeds with dust buster. You come by for some gardening tips? You know, Xenia, I have a special interest in this case. Not only because I got shot, because I keep hoping I'm gonna find out that Bram's only involved in this from the waist down. Oh, by the way, your place is whistle clean. Found nothing. Well, almost nothing. Complete specs for Sapphire security alarms systems. What's this, a little late night reading before bedtime? It this illegal to own a technical manual? Hmm? You know, this would even qualify as circumstantial. And while we're at it, you haven't shown me your search warrant. I don't have one. File a complaint. You know where I found that? In your closet. In a jacket. A man's jacket. Bram's jacket. Well, then why don't you go to his house then and sit in the dark? Well, maybe I should. Trouble is, I hate those goddamn snakes. Be seeing you soon, Xenia. [knocking at door] Yeah! [dog barking] What's going on? What's going on? Things are getting hot. So many tools and stuff. Just get rid of them, all right? There's more in my storage locker. Here's the key. Just get rid of that, too. Okay? Just keep... Whatever, whatever sell it for, just, just keep it. You okay? Gonna get you a drink. Ray, where'd you get this? What? The pre-Columbian, the snake. Where did you get it? That's Chac. That's a Mayan snake god. God damn it, Ray, Where did you get it? -Client. -Who? Hey, I don't ask you any question. Which client? Was it Bram Hatcher? Like you, Xe, I owe all my clients discretion. Cut the shit, Ray. You goddamn know Bram, don't you? How do you know Bram? Ray, I said how do you know Bram! Come on, cut that shit out! Tell me the truth now. Yeah, I know him, all right? He's a cop. He busted me once. Said I could continue in this business if I paid him off. Pay him off how? -Cash. -What else? Was it information? Huh? You're a snitch, aren't you. You're a fucking snitch. Sometimes. Look here, I wasn't snitching on you, Xe. A guy comes to me with a big job he's not talking about. Asked me who's the best I knew at B&E. Someone to do a third floor break in. Top of the line alarm system. -Sapphire. -Sapphire? Yeah. He said that? He said Sapphire specifically? Asked me if I knew anybody who did safes. I told him you did. I wasn't sure if you still did. What else? Something to do in and unoccupied building. He said that was very important. When was this? It was way before Christmas. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to go to jail. I wouldn't make it in there, Xe. You look like an all round win-win-win situation. [phone ringing] Ray. Look, Ray, I'm not here. I'm not here. And we never talked. -Okay? -Okay. [phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] [phone beeps on] Hello? [glass shattering] [thumping] [dog barking] Oh, God. Ray. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Xe. Xe... Hang on, Ray. The hospital's close. I'm fucked, Xe. Come on, Ray, come on. Get up. Come on. Come on, Ray. The hospital's close. Come on, Ray. Shit! Come on, Ray! The worst that can befall thee... Fuck you. -Measur'd right. -Get up! Get up. Finish it. -Finish it. -Fuck you, Ray. Get up! Get up! [sobbing] Is a sound slumber and a long good night. Please, get up, Ray. Please. Please! Please, Ray. Please. Please. [sobbing] Please, Ray. [door opens] [keys jingling] Xenia? I'm here You okay? Huh? We go a change of plan. Where's the money? -I hid it. -You hid it? I got, I got nervous. I didn't want it around. I put it in a sewer pipe. It's under the Tannhauser bridge. I got some bad news. There's a fence, you know him. Ray Costello. He got, uh, picked up tonight. He's downtown now, copping a plea. Spilling his guts about you and your career. So we've gotta get you out here of. This place is gonna be swarming with cops and about five minutes. Don't worry. I've worked this out. Just listen to this. Listen, all right? -Okay. -They know that I'm here. I asked to make the collar myself. Like, uh, like I'm gonna bust you. Right? Now, this is the way we're going to do it. You're gonna, you're gonna to shoot me here in the thigh. Don't worry. It'll go through clean. It'll heal up quick. It'll take away any suspicions that I let you go. I'll scream, "Freeze, police!" all that shit real loud so the neighbors can hear, then fire a couple of shots in the air. But you just keep on going. You follow? Xenia. We got no choice. Things got fucked, they got fucked, but we're gonna make it. Okay? We'll just get you out of town, I'll lay low a couple of months, we'll figure it out. Don't cry, don't cry. You got to do this. Don't worry about hurting me. I'll be okay, all right? God damn it, Xenia! Listen to me, you've got to do this. [groaning] Freeze! Police! [grunting] Drop the gun. Drop the damn gun! Go! [gasping] Bye, Mummy. Shit. [dialing] [cell phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] Yeah? Is it Colin? Just listen to me, all right? There's a fence. His name is Ray Costello. Ray Costello. He was murdered tonight. And I know this is hard for you to believe, but Bram killed him. Okay? You've got to help me. Please help me. Well, Xenia. How nice of you to call. Why? You were always telling me to break the rules. What made you think I wouldn't break yours? I'll explain it better when I see you. You won't find me. I'm a cop, remember? I could put out warrants in all 50 states if I have to. Real pretty photos. Whatever it takes, I'll find you. I'll talk. I'll go down, but I'll talk. And tell them what? We dated a couple of times I dropped you, that's it. The rest you made up. I caught you planting evidence. It's old stuff, but it works. I'll make sure of that. And now, there's... There's nobody left to back up your story. Nobody. [car door opening] I don't think that's biodegradable. What's in the bag, Xenia? Money. Why? You gonna frame me? Call the cops, come back, get it later when I'm in jail? I think maybe... you better go get it Open it. Just money? Money, that's all you wanted? All I wanted? You know, my whole goddamn life changed when you came into the picture. I mean, I was even trying to improvise so this whole thing could work out for us. I told you I didn't need that goddamn money. All I needed was you. But you? You wanted the money as much as me. You know? We could've been partners. Madden didn't have to die. We could have done 10 Madden jobs without anyone getting hurt. Well, partners. Fuck you, how you said that. Xe, Madden knew too much about me. I was his partner, his silent partner. So much for partners. I mean, you were better off before I came into the picture, right? You know... The only thing that I didn't count on was falling in love with you. Love? Love? Is that what you call this? The toughest part of all. So this is how it ends? You just gonna shoot fish in a bucket? I wish we both could've been. I do love you. Well, you can't kill memories. And I'll never forget you, Bram. Never. [grunting] I can wait for you forever. [ticking] [bell ringing] I'll get you everything you need. Food. Shelter. Warmth. Maybe even a little love. Hmm? [car starting]
