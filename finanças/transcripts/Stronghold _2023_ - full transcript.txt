The markers are here to keep us safe. Don't ever cross them. You don't want to see what's on the other side of the markers. Nothing but pain, fear, and destruction. You will not take my girl from me. We'll have full bellies tonight. Good job, Sunshine. You have to always be alert, Sol. - I was. - You didn't hear me coming. That's how you can die, Sol. You have to be alert. You have to know your surroundings. You said that we were safe here. From the sick people, yes. But not from the bears. The bears don't carry spears. They don't carry spears... but they run faster than you. - I wish that we saw a bear. - Why? Because if we caught one, then we could eat for months. That's if it didn't kill us first. I bet... we will have enough food for the winter. I better eat all the fruit while I still can. Mm. That's the one thing I miss from before. Being able to stock fruit and vegetables and meat in a fridge was the life. Tell me about before. I bet if we made jams or preserves from the fruit, we could keep it. You've never had jam before, have you? I'll pick up some containers the next time I make a day trip. Tell me about before. It was... loud and busy. And the air was heavy, thick, and dirty. And there was a lot of people and not enough food. Actually, it was enough people... just not enough willing to feed the hungry. And, uh, people, they... they became slaves to objects. They-- they valued it more than-- than human life, more than family. And, um... people were just consumed with the objects... and the gadgets and the gizmos. They were the worst. I never told you about the gadgets. Well, they were these tiny devices meant to make life easier. But it was just an illusion. Life only got harder. People became slaves to these objects. What about the gizmos? You're so silly , sunshine. It means the same as a gadget. Two words that mean the same thing? Mm-hmm. Yeah. There were so many devices. Just so many names. Did you have one? Yeah, everyone did. Man, child... woman. Children, too? No matter how many parenting experts told them, "Do not give these to children..." "Wait until they're two years old," they would say. These kids, they had them. The babies, before they were out of diapers. Why did everyone want these devices? They were meant to keep people connected. You could find someone anywhere, anytime. That's wonderful. No. People rarely answered their devices. They were just too consumed with things that were meaningless. And no one had any privacy. All of your information was out there... for anyone to find. So, no one ever had to be alone? No. Just the opposite, sunshine. The only thing that people were connected to... was their own loneliness. Let's eat. Mm. Which book do you want to read tonight? I'm not in the mood for Dracula or Frankenstein. I know. Tell me about Papa. He was handsome, and he had your eyes. And he had a smile that could melt anyone's heart. That's how he got me. That's the smile. And... he took care of us for as long as he could. Tell me a story about him. Once, um, there was a squirrel right there on the side of the house. Easy pickings? No, no, no. This was before. Um, we didn't eat squirrels. We-- we got food from grocery stores. There were these big grocery stores with everything that you could imagine. And squirrels, they were just these fuzzy little creatures that people found adorable. So, when your papa saw one with a broken leg... he just had to nurse it back to health and release it into the wild. Oh, no, Sol. It's not like that. Things were different. We have to hunt now. Where was I? You were just a baby. -A baby. -Mm-hmm. What's that like? Oh, loud and noisy, and fussy and messy and... wonderful. I want a baby. You know that you need a man to do that. We are the only two people out left, I mean, there's-- there's no one else out there, Sol. Good night, Sol. I love you. Good night. Hmm. Morning. What are you doing up there? Had a dream last night. About? You were kissing Papa. You weren't you. Who was I? Someone else. And there was a butterfly. Dreams don't always make sense. About last night... I don't wanna give you false hope, Sol. We may be the only two people left who aren't sick. I know. I just liked it better when there was a chance. You eat breakfast? I'm going to town soon. Get some supplies. You'll be all right by yourself? I always am. Let me help you. You were gone too long. Did you see anyone? It's getting hotter out there. Take me with you next time. No, um, you're not ready. Well, I'll have to go sometime. Not now, we'll just wait 'til you get older. I'm old enough. The things out there, once you've seen them, they change you. You-- you'll never be the same. You seem fine. That's because I had to learn to live with a lot. Had to bury the people that meant the most to me. Your uncles, your father. You may not remember this, but your papa... he suffered a lot. When all this happened... order was the first thing to go. There was no police, no military. There was just chaos and people, they were killing themselves just for simple items. No police? Mm-mm. Why, what happened? Well, when there was no order, the respect for the uniform was the first to go. And people were getting infected. Police had to protect themselves. There's no honor in the badge when the virus is the enemy. What are the signs of the infected? Well, there's fever and chills and your skin turns gray. And then you start coughing, you know, sometimes you cough up blood. Then you become comatose. -Coma-- -Comatose. It's like when you go to sleep, but you don't wake up. I thought you only sleep and not wake up when you're dead. Well, the virus, it changes you during the comatose stage. And when you do wake up... your skin is really gray and there's red around your eyes, and your whole body has sores. And the worst part is... You're not yourself anymore. Mm. There's no light behind the eyes. Only violence. It's a nightmare out there. And I just want to protect you and keep you safe just a little longer. I just want you to be happy. I thought you could retire your old doll. That doll was yours when you were little. I'm never getting rid of it. But I love this doggie. Thank you. Were the real ones this soft and little? Yeah, some of them. They looked just like the wolves we see up in the mountains. I figured you would like that. This looks almost brand new. Where did you find it? I had to go a little further. But this one house had all these goods. Mm. How did they ever make it smell like that? Well, they used to have, like, these big factories and big machines, assembly lines, and a chemistry lab. Like in Hard Times? Speaking of Hard Times... Ooh. Where'd you find this? Don't touch this, sunshine. Guns can be dangerous. Um, I got it in case an animal comes too close. Or if the infected show up here? Yeah, well, we would hear them. - The bells? - Yeah, the bells. They keep us safe. I-- I'll teach you how to use this one day and I have the feeling you'll be a natural. In the meantime, don't touch it. Could only get so many bullets and... we only have to fire this if it's absolutely necessary. - Okay. - Okay. Here. I want to see you in that. I wanna save it for a special occasion. Okay. I know you wouldn't be on the property lines. Where did you find that? In your room. Why would you hide this thing? Who was that? What was he doing here? I mean, he didn't look sick and you said that-- Sol, we have talked about this so many times. You said that there were no police. Sol. What did you do with the body? I-- I buried him. Way out into the woods, far away from us. You touched the body? You know you could get sick, Sol! How many times have I told you, don't go past the property line! What was he doing here? I don't know. He was sick, he-- he attacked me. He didn't look sick. They don't always look sick. Except for the bullet hole. That's how this disease works. They look normal, until they lunge at you and they try to kill you. He didn't look sick. They don't always look sick. What did you do, Sol? Nena, I found a man in the woods. A survivor. -What? -Yeah. Stay back. -Sol, stay back. -No. It could be dangerous. Let me show you where he is. Sol, stay back. Keep your distance! I don't need you to come with me. Come on. It's okay. -Is he alive? -Stay back, Sol. Can you fix him? Is he infected? He doesn't look infected. I don't know. I wished for him. Don't let him die. He needs water. I told you, do not touch him. -You could get sick. -What about you? I had it, I lived, I'm immune. You never told me you were infected. Sol, I am trying to help this man. - He needs water. - I know he needs water. Stay back, Sol. If we both help, this will go faster. How is he? He's knocked out cold. I gave him some herbs. I'm doing the best that I can. What's this? Same thing that I gave him. It'll help you with the infection. But I'm not sick. That's how the disease works. But you touched the sheriff... so it's better to be safe. But you said that the disease was certain death, Nena. You had it before. If I told you to eat those berries in the woods... that it might make you die or just very sick... would you risk it? That you might die, but it's not certain? This disease took your father and it tried to take me. Why would you risk it? Sometimes I used to wish for death... to be reunited. -But now-- -But now? I have hope. Hope? That there might be others like him. Go to bed. "He couldn't tell where he was... or when he was. As he looked out into the darkness..." Oh. Nena? Nena? What happened? You were sick. We both were. We're better now. Drink. What's your name? Marcus. -And you? -Sol. I found you in the woods. Who's the mean lady? That's my Nena. She helped you. Is she your mother? What are you two doing out here anyway? Surviving. I guess that's what I'm doing, too. Are there others like you? Other survivors? Yeah. There's others like me, you can say that. That's wonderful. Where did you come from, Marcus? Can you take us there? I-- I don't even know where there is. Do you have children? I've never even seen a child since I-- Whoa, slow down, Sol. Slow down. No, I don't have any children. And my sister, Bri, is the only person I have. You're the first person that I've talked to in years, besides Nena and Papa, but he died when I was little. He was infected. But before the virus-- I thought I told you to stay away from him. I-- it's okay, Nena. He's not sick and I'm not sick. Everyone's okay. Marcus, this is my Nena. Thank you very much for everything you and your daughter did to help me. We're happy to help. Now that you're all better, I can help you find your way back. Yes, of course. I'll be leaving first thing in the morning. No, you-- he can't go. -He just got here. -Sol, we have work to do. Someone has to clean and smoke all this meat before it goes bad. He can't leave yet! He just got here, he can tell us about the world. I already know all that. Well, I don't. Sol, there's nothing out there for you. And you don't even know anything about this man. Because you won't let me. I tried to ask questions. He's not sick. Sol, I know his type. He's no good. He's gonna bring us more trouble if he stays here. -What does that even mean? -There's people after him. What people? Everyone is infected or dead, right? Sol-- Tell me the truth. There are people out there, and you've seen them. Admit it. There are some people. I haven't seen many, but there's some. It always scares me. Scare you? How? You know the sheriff? Marcus brought him here. -What? -Yeah. How? The sheriff came before. He followed him into the woods. And now there could be others. We've been exposed. And there's gonna be some people coming after them. I don't even know if we are safe here anymore and I think we have to leave. Okay. I'm ready to leave when you are, Nena. But you're not ready for what's out there. They hunt people. They hurt women. And they steal and infect you just for a sport. But you're a woman. They've never hurt you. My sweet and naive Sol. That's because I had to learn to protect myself... after being hurt so many times. And I have protected you from all of that. And I have kept you safe. And I am not going to let that no good Marcus take that from me. Was the sheriff sick or not? He surprised me, sunshine. He caught me off guard, and I just-- I had to act fast and I regret it. I have never killed anyone before. And I'm not proud of it. But I did it to protect you. I would do anything for you, Sol. I would die for you. And that is what a mother does for her child. She protects them no matter what. Okay. -Okay, Nena. -Okay. When do you want to leave? Where are we gonna go next? I-- I don't know, um... Let's just get the meat ready for dinner in the smoker. And then you and me are gonna get rid of Marcus. And then we're gonna come up with a plan to leave this place for good. Yeah. I'm, um-- I'm gonna go get the maps. And I'mma see where we could go. Jesus, Sol. You can't sneak up on people like that. Especially when they're naked. What is this place? Who is this? I need to get dressed. Can you please turn around, Sol? Your Nena was right. You really are young for your age. When did you talk to Nena? Last night. She told me all about you. She said that you were dangerous. Is that right? Yeah, she's right. But don't worry. I won't be around you and your Nena much longer. And I'm not gonna hurt you. Either of you. I'm not afraid of you. Who is this? Sol... no good will come from this. I found a body. A sheriff in the woods. Sheriff? What do you mean a sheriff? -How long ago? -Yesterday. That's not good. That's not good at all. Did you bring him here? Sol... Yes, but not on purpose. He must have been after me. -I don't know. -It's okay. It's safe here. Nena killed him. She what? Why would she kill him? I need to get out of here. No, no, no, no. Why did you do that, Sol? I've never kissed anyone before. Sol, you shouldn't have done that. You're just a child. Uh, I have a first aid kit. -I don't need your help. -You do. Here, careful. I'll be right back. What's going on? Marcus hurt himself on one of my traps. He's not going anywhere for a while. Nobody's going anywhere. Don't get too attached. Just like that squirrel your papa nursed back to health, Marcus will have to go back where he came from. I'm all he has now, Nena. He needs me. Why did you do this to me, Sol? You fell. It's okay, I'm gonna help you now. I'm gonna bandage you up. -Does that feel good? -That's enough, Sol. - What's wrong? - I just need to get some rest. Okay. Marcus? Hello, Sol. What are you doing here? My leg is killing me. Do you have any more of those pills your Nena gave you? I don't know where she keeps them. Nena uses this for pain. Last time I had one of Nena's concoctions, I was sick like a dog. Do dogs get sick a lot? It's just whiskey. See? Are you even old enough to drink? Nena was always giving me whiskey, if I couldn't fall asleep or if I was sick. Mm. Not bad. Who was the girl in your photo? That's my sister, Bri. You're so lucky. Why? I always wanted a sister or a brother or... anybody, really. You have Nena. It's not the same. What's it like? Having a sister? Well, she made me who I am today. I didn't know what love was... before she came around. I mean, don't get me wrong, she could be very annoying sometimes. But there's nothing I wouldn't do for her. Nothing. It's much simpler here. I understand why your Nena loves this place. I don't want to talk about Nena. Can I see that photo? I can't wait to meet her. I don't know when I'm ever gonna see her again. Does she have the virus? No, Sol. I want you to take me with you when you go. I can't. Why not? Have you ever heard the saying, "Ignorance is bliss?" You can't put the genie back into the bottle, Sol. Once it's out, it's out. I want out. I can't sit here and make the same mistake twice. Sol. There is no virus. There never was. Your Nena, she's been lying to you this whole time. What? I'm sorry. What do you mean there's no virus? Sunshine. What's the noise out there? Uh... I'm just going to check on my traps. I'll be back later. Sol? Sol? She's gonna catch you, Sol. She's going hunting. We have time. Nena always kept this locked. She's hiding something. What? Do you-- do you know what this means? She's been out to the world. These are receipts and-- and bank statements and this is-- this is a grant deed applied to this house. She owns this house. I need to talk to Nena. "Missing: Sol Moreno." Always be aware. Remember when I taught you to hunt? First time you struck an animal, you started crying. I didn't want to embarrass you, so I didn't ask you. Why were you crying? They were... tears of joy. I felt like I could do anything that day. I felt like I could survive on my own. You can do anything. Just not now. And one day you'll be able to survive, but right now, you need me. You know, we owe it to your papa to stay together. You and me. To be good to each other. We owe him that much to honor his memory. I'll have this ready by dinner. Yeah. I'll see you soon. What did she say? She didn't say anything. I need real answers. There's something you need to know. Now, Sol, this is a very old flier. There's no way of knowing if your mother is still there. Why didn't you tell me the truth from the beginning? Why did you stab me in my leg? 'Cause I didn't want you to leave. Look... I didn't know what was going on. I thought it was best to assess the situation first and talk second. And then Nena and I spoke. And there were threats. But you deserve to know the truth. I'm gonna try this number. - Hello? - Hello. I'm looking for Sabrina Moreno. Is this the correct number? Yes, this is she. Who is this? My name is Marcus, and... I think I found your daughter, Sol. She's here with me. - Is she there? - Who is this? This is... Sol. I... I think you might be my-- my mother? Sol? Sol, Sol! Is this really you? Yeah, it's-- it's me, Sol. How do I know? How do I know it's really you? I can take a photo. Is this a cell phone? Yes. Okay, hold on. Sol, look over here. Smile. Yeah. Oh, it's been so long! And... She's a woman now. Oh, my God. She's a woman now, but I think it's really you. Sol-- Sol, do you remember me? I, um... I think I remember butterflies. I got-- I got matching butterfly shirts for your third birthday. I used to trace the shape. You traced the butterfly shape, yes. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Young man, please, please, can you please just bring Sol back here for me, please? Or I can-- I can go, I can go pick her up right now. Where are you? Where are you? Like, how do I do this? How do I get you both? Or I can call-- I call 911 right now. No, no, that's not necessary. - We'll-- we'll find you. - Okay. Please, please tell me where are you. We're somewhere in the Black Hills Forest. You're close. Text me all your information. I'm texting you right now... Thank you again. Thank you again, young man. Yes, thank you. What's your last name? Just Marcus, Miss Moreno. I'll see you soon, Mother. I'll see you soon, my baby, I see you soon, okay? Can-- can we stay on the phone? No, I'm sorry. My battery is low. I have to hang up now. Okay, okay, okay, Marcus, I have your number. Call me back right after you charge that phone, okay? -Please. -Sounds good. Uh, see you soon. Your Nena, or whoever she is, didn't take you very far. Your mother was right. This whole time you were really close. 71 miles to be exact. That's not very far. We-- we can go-- we can go in a car. Nena always said that cars kept people apart and polluted the planet. Yeah, well, she's not wrong. But she forgot to mention that they can be very convenient when we need to go somewhere fast. How can we get there? Let's just go the same way that you came back. Sol... Marcus, how did you get here? I drove... in a car. But it wasn't my car. It was borrowed. It doesn't matter, the-- the sheriff's department probably has it now. I had to ditch it a while back. The sheriff is dead. No, Sol. That's just one of them. There's a whole department looking for me. Okay, well, how can we get there? I-- Maybe they can help us. No, Sol. If they find me, I'm toast. I've done some things. The world is a complicated place. Not like here. Look. I wanna help you, I do. I wanna take you back to the world and to your mother, but... I don't want to go back. I can't go back. Then tell me how to get there. I can go by myself. You've never been anywhere on your own. You don't know anything about the world out there. It doesn't mean that I can't do it. No, it's not safe for you. You shouldn't go. I can't stay here. I'll do it with or without your help. No. No. I can't let you go alone. I'll take you. Oh, uh, sorry, uh-- Wow, that's a great color on you. Okay. Let's go. Uh, yeah. Let's go. Uh, wait, Sol, uh... I need to show you this. You need to memorize this address in case we get separated. 1706 Clark Lane. Okay. Do I need to remember those numbers, too? No, only if you want to write a letter. You will not take my girl from me. Sol, it's okay. He's going away, and you and I, we're gonna go back to our old lives. No. No, I'm not going back to our old lives. Sol, you can't listen to him. He's a liar. He's a bad person. - He's a fake and-- - You're a liar. You're not my mother. You killed the sheriff. Who else have you killed? Who the hell was Papa? Sol, don't let him come between us. It's me and you. It's me and you against all of them, me and you against all the sick people out there. I never had a say in any of this and I don't want to do it anymore. No! Let go of me! Ah! Sol! Stop! Careful, Sol, it's-- it's loaded. Sol, what are you doing? Who are you? You owe me that. I was your neighbor. I used to babysit you sometimes. Everybody's not dead... but they might as well be by the time we had left civilization. They were all zombies to their technology, their violence, their drugs. Their prejudice. Why me? Because I wanted to give you a better life. Your father was never home... and I watched you and your mother, and she was always glued to her phone or her TV or her tablet or some other gadget. Her Alexas, her smart watch... but never you. She-- she-- she didn't pay you any attention, Sol. More lies. No, no. You-- you were just a possession for them. They didn't see how special you were... how you deserved attention. It was always money or things or events, but never you. Sol, she didn't love you. Sol, I saved you, gave you a better life. I saved you to save us. It still... doesn't make sense. Why? Because she died. Who? My baby girl! She died in the crib. And I-- I just-- I couldn't-- I couldn't get out of bed for months. I tried everything. Therapy, medicine... and nothing-- nothing made me feel whole again, Sol. And I watched that baby. I watched that baby like a hawk since she shot out of me. I never left her aside for one waking moment! Not to use the bathroom, not to eat. And then one day she's just-- she just stopped breathing. And so... I-- I watched and I waited... and told him... that I had a surprise. And you, you were waiting here in the cabin... and I told him, I said, "We can have a-- a fresh start, we could be a family again." But he didn't see what I saw in you. And he looked at me like I was a monster. And I told him we were far away, but he just couldn't accept it. Did you kill him for not seeing how special I am? No. Mm-mm. He did that himself. He hung himself right there in that tree. I didn't know, Sol. I didn't know he was in so much pain. I mean, how can you know when you're in so much pain yourself? And then that's when I knew... I had to go back. I had to make sure that I had medicine and a first aid kit... because I couldn't let anything happen to you. What I don't understand is how you went so long without being caught. If you were their neighbor and you disappeared at the same time they did... how did they not catch you? You had to have been the prime suspect. Cops don't really look that hard... for missing Brown girls. It's the first thing you and I agree on. I'm sorry. You're not ready to go out there. Once you leave this place and you see that real world... you will never be the same. Don't listen to her, Sol, she's trying to manipulate you. You need me, Sol. You need me. You are not ready, Sol, you need me. This was only real because I believed. I know the truth now. I can't keep living a lie. Sol! No, Sol, Sol! Sol! Sol. Sol. Please, please, Sol. Please. Please don't do this. Don't leave. Sol, please... I won't let you take her back to that filthy world! I'm not about to hit a woman, that's not who I am. Good. Enough! Stop, stop it! Get off of him! Are you okay? That's it! That's it! I've had enough of you. Get out of my face while you still can! - No! - Sol, move! Sol! Marcus? Sol. I'm sorry, my baby. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let him hurt you. I'm gonna get you help. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna get you help. Marcus, Marcus, she needs help. Marcus. Stay with me. I love you. Stay with me. I love you. Okay. Ah, God, Sol. Sol, I need your help. Come on. What did you do? No! No! No! God, Sol. Sol, I need your help. Come on. You killed her. Why did you kill her? I didn't want to kill her, it was self-defense, okay? - Self-defense? - Ow, God! What is it with you women and the violence, huh? What are you doing? Did you come here to rob us? No. No, I grabbed that because I knew you would need that -out there in the real world. -How can I believe you? I'm not Nena. I wouldn't lie to you. You were gonna come into our house... -No. No, no-- -...and leave me here. You were going to leave me here. - No. - How can I believe you? No, I wouldn't do that to you, Sol. This is what got you here, isn't it? You took things that weren't yours and the sheriff came after you. It's not that simple! I had to do those things. Why? Because I killed a man! I killed a man because he hurt my sister. My only sister. So, I killed him because he hurt her. Okay? You don't know what she meant to me. So, I had to leave, and if they find me, they're gonna put me in jail. And I don't deserve to go to jail. Maybe you should get caught. You killed Nena. And she killed the sheriff. Can you take me to my mother's house? Yes. I'll take you as far as I can, but you have to give the flier to a sheriff and they'll take you the rest of the way. Let's get you cleaned up. I know how to sew. Oh, slow. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Um... You need to sterilize that with alcohol or something. I've done this a million times with Nena. Hold still. We gotta go. I have to bury her. Sol, this woman kidnapped you. She's my Nena. I'm only alive because of her. I gotta go now. Sol, please. Sol, we gotta go. No! I won't live by someone else's rules anymore. This is my time. We go when I say we go. I need to get to a hospital. Please, hurry up. Goodbye, Nena. What is it? We don't need these anymore. What do you think she'll be like? My mother? I don't know. She'll probably look like you. I hope she's like the woman in my dreams, full of music. Are you okay? Do we need to rest? No, I'll be fine. I just need some water. We should keep going. I wonder if I'll have my own room. Do you think I'll meet people my age? Sure, of course you will. What do people my age even do? Well, people your age don't live with their parents anymore, that's for sure. They don't? Why not? I don't know, Sol. They just live on their own or at school. Many places. School. I always wanted to go to school. Give me a second. Give me a second. -You okay? -No. Okay, okay, okay. Are you all right? Marcus, wake up. Marcus, I need you. Sol... find her. I need you, Marcus. You can survive on your own. She's probably out there waiting for you. Keep going. What about you? I just-- I just need to rest, Bri. Bri? I was just trying to protect you, Bri. I hope you know that. I can't leave you. Yes, you can. Go. You have to keep going. Go. Go. Find-- Go now. Are you okay? Did your car break down somewhere? Where are you going? Is this you? Were you locked in a basement somewhere for years? Can you talk? I-- I was lost. Do you need me to drop you off somewhere? Can you take me to my mother's house? How about I take you into town? You must be hungry. I am. Get in. Safety first. What's your name? Sol. Oh, it's okay, it's okay, yes. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
