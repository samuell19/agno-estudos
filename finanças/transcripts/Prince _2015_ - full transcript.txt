Awesome, man. - You're a bitch. - No, you're a bitch. - You're a bitch. - No, you are. Say it: I'm a bitch. - You are a bitch. - 'I'm a bitch.' - You're a bitch. - No, I'm a bitch. - You're a bitch. Nobody fucks with my little brother. - Boys. - Yo, Ronnie. Having fun blowing stuff up, little bro? I just got even with Mark for you. - He's not right in the head. - I don't care. Have you seen that Diablo? - Which year? - No idea. Of course not. Don't fuck with me. Fucking junkie. Pancake. Dog's face. Son of a whore. Half-blood. Goddamn it. I want one of those, man. Our time will come. What a ride. It's Kalpa's Lamborghini. No way. I know him from school, he was a loser. A nerd. He couldn't do anything. He has Gucci, Valentino's, Rolex's. Zanotti's, Balenciaga's. Guns, jewelry, the hottest women... - Louis Vuitton. - Fendi. - Prada. - Dolce & Gabbana. Canada Goose. Armani. Marc Jacobs. Prada. Breitling. Karl Lagerfeld. Everything. The whole shebang. Ronnie said people should stay away from him. It's dirty business. - Every businessman is dirty. - Not me. - You're no businessman. - If I would be. What if, what if. - You're right, guys. I'm no businessman. - That's okay, Achraf, me neither. Hi, mom. Hi. You have to promise me something. What? Don't become like mom. Only if you promise me something as well. What? Don't become like your dad. What do you mean? Of course not. I promise. I promise. - Can I ask you one more thing? - What? - Laura, right? - Yeah. - Do you think she would like me? - Are you in love? Maybe. She's with Vince. She thinks you're a bum. What do you mean, bum? Wait and see. A few small changes. - Relaxed. - You're crazy. Check out these guns. Look at me. Who's the bum now? The muscles from Brussels. How's your mom? She's fine. - And your sister? - She's fine too. - How are you? - I'm fine too. Whistler. Thanks. Do you have something for me? There you go. I hope it will rain soon. I'm sweating like a pig, man. Smell. Smells fine, man. I need new shoes, man. I look like a bum. Sweetie, are you coming? I'll be right down. Hi, little brother. Do you know where Kalpa lives? I know. Ronnie always hangs with him, right? They're in business together. Stay away, he'll destroy you. I'll tell you a story about a guy from my hood. - Kalpa completely ruined him, man. - How? His name was Rudy. He was on the rise. Long golden hair in a ponytail, and deep blue eyes. Bling in his ears and a Roley on his wrist. A machine, mean. Kalpa gave him jobs, but they were crappy jobs. Yo, Kalpa. Let's hang out. You and me. - Do you know why? - Why? Because Kalpa was only interested in his mother. Kalpa fucked his mother while Rudy did these shit jobs. Bullshit. He lay awake at night while his mother was with Kalpa, moaning loudly. Your girl. There she goes. Go to her, quick. He doesn't stand a chance. - How's it going? - Fine. - You're looking good. - Thanks. Can I take you to the city centre once, when you have time? - Ayoub is your name, right? - That's right. - What? Not okay? - Forget it. - Fawaka. - So? - We have a date next week. - Sure. I'm taking it slow, matter of time. You know. Foreplay. What do you know about foreplay? You've never kissed a girl. - Sure I did. - Who? - A girl from way back. - How? Just like this. You're crazy, bro. I'll show you. You grab her by the hips and slowly make your way to her mouth. You start using your tongue. You grab her ass, you whisper in her ear. She starts giggling. Get it? You lick her neck and keep using your tongue. Do you get it? Nice and slowly with your tongue. - What are you doing? - That how it's done. Come here, Oussi. I'll show you. You hold your girl like this and start dancing. You close your eyes. You sway to the left and the right, back and forth. Why were you talking to my girl? Why do you hang with such a loser? - His dad is a real junkie. - Shut up, man. - Come here. - He won't hurt you. Come here. I won't hurt you. Filthy dogs. A bunch of losers. I'm so fed up, man. Let's see. Hansie_53. 'The spiritual person is essentially looking' 'for the true identity.' He needs to ask himself where he comes from and where he's going. And this one? It's no use. Ayoub, I'm giving up. 'Well-groomed, funny, spontaneous.' 'Widower, loves cooking and music.' So do you, right? 'Is looking for a well-groomed, sweet younger lady...' She is standing right beside me. - You're the man of the house. - And the strongest. You can feel my guns if you want. It's okay. Body builder. You can only trust your own body in this world. Everything else is bullshit. You have to make sure you're ballin'. That you're confident. That you control the way you move. I use this for boys. But when I see a lady, I give her something like this. - You are a real pervert. - I'm just chivalrous. You don't even know what chivalrous means. Look at these. Come and get me baby. I'm ready for you. Demi. Sometimes you're lucky, sometimes you're not. Demi. Dinner's ready. Demi, are you coming home? I'll be right there. What are you doing with them? - I asked you a question. - Relax. It's none of your business. Are you dating Ronnie? - Ronnie? - Are you with him? - Don't fucking smile like that. - Relax. I'm not doing anything. - Don't you remember our promise? - I'm not doing anything wrong. Stupid junkie. Mom? Demi's hanging out with the wrong guys. I saw her. You just mind your own business. Demi's is old enough. Leave her alone. - I won't leave her alone. - Yes, you will. No, I won't. - She's not old enough at all. - And that's up to you to decide? I don't want my sister to become a slut. You're a prick, just like your dad. - Shut the fuck up. - I'm sorry. Really. - Don't talk like that about my dad. - I shouldn't have, sorry. No wonder you don't have a boyfriend. What's the matter with my dad anyway? Your father is just a... He's just a little bird. Guys, I need to tell you something. I think Ronnie is seeing my sister. No way. What do you mean? How can you be so sure? I just am. He's my brother. I would know. - Relax. She's only your half sister. - Exactly. Doesn't matter, I grew up with her. I love her. I will kill anyone who touches her. Your sister's hot though. I hope the thunderstorm comes. - Hi, dad. - Hi. How's mom? She's fine. - And how's Demi? - She's fine too. How are you? Fine. I think Demi's seeing Ronnie from the hood. - Do you still have that card? - Yeah. Whistler. Do you want it? - Can I? - Of course. Dad, I'm in love. Can you help me? Dad, can you help me? - Stay, wait a minute. - Let me go. - Do you have something for me? - Dad, behave. Come here. Don't let anyone mess with you, son. Ayoub. Kalpa? Have an energy drink. Come and see me soon. It's been too long. Thanks. It's nice and sweet. Ayoub? Youpie? Hi, honey. Hi, sweetheart. How are you? - Franky is in your room. - Franky? I've been saved. If my dad hadn't been there for me... I wouldn't have been able to sit next to you. Youpie. We should go. I was waiting for you, man. We need to talk about something. I have a job for us. Nice one. Give me that bag, I'll take it to Ronnie. - Fifty? - More is coming, really. Franky? Where have you been? It's so early. I had to take care of something with Franky. Right. What? What is it? Mom, you know I wish you all the happiness... ...in the world. Do you have something for me? Only two euros. Give them to me. It's no use with your brother. - What do you mean? - Fifty euro is nothing. You can fuck a whore for fifty euro. You should be grateful. Come here. What are you doing with these rats? I don't trust you. You smell, clown. You fucking Moroccan. Here, 200 euro. You can stop hassling me. Kalpa? Ayoub? Good to see you. Here, have an energy drink. Tastes good, huh? Come in. Come. Do you like those? Put them on. Come through. One moment. Hush, hush. I have a job for you. - You have Zanotti's? - Yeah. Super cool. I know. So you have new shoes? Where do you get those? -Zanotti's are so hot. - He's ballin'. Which dick did you have to suck for those? I don't have time for child's play. Don't act like you're a gangster or something. Hi. Hi. Shall I fix you lasagne someday? Lasagne? Yeah, I'll throw it up like this. - You have to put it in the oven. - Then I'll throw it in the oven. You don't know what you're missing. Kalpa? Kalpa. - Hey, lovebirds. - What's up? Hey, Youpie. - How dare you? - What do you mean? Do you think I don't know? - With my friends. - Your friends? - Do you think I didn't see you? - Stop it, Ayoub. They think you're pathetic. - No way. - It's true. - No way. - And do you know what else? - Shut your fucking mouth. - Stop it. Stupid son of a junkie. Have you gone mad? Are you okay? What's he doing? Ayoub? Take it easy, man. Where's that little junk? We'll get him. Get a grip, man. You're no broad, are you? Franky says your sister gives good head. Nobody touches my brother. Nobody touches my sister. Don't. Idiot. Come on. - Leave him. - Reign your girl in. Get your hands off me. - Get him up. - Ayoub. Ayoub. Nobody touches my little bro. Nobody. Daddy. - Daddy. - Ayoub? What are you doing here? You look just like me. I can't go on, son. Really, I can't. Kalpa. Prince. You drive. Take a right. Easy, easy. Ayoub? Honey, where are you? Darling, listen. Something terrible has happened. Your father died. Daddy is dead. Ayoub? Do you hear me? Are you happy? Ayoub? What did you say? Are you happy? You? No. Drive. Who hurt you? Who hurt you? Who hurt you? Who hurt you? Who hurt you? Who hurt you? Who hurt you? Ronnie. Ronnie, that son of a bitch. I knew it, that dirty fuck. His little brother was my best friend, Franky. His brother is an asshole. Ronnie is an asshole. We're going to destroy him. We'll get him. Who hurt you? - Who hurt you? - Ronnie. Ronnie. That son of a bitch. Ronnie. Take it easy. Lick the street. And say meow. All of you. Bitch. I'm Kalpa bitch. Here. Shoot him. Kill him. It's easy. Like this. Bang, bang. Shoot him. Like this. Poof. Bang. Bang, bang. Ayoub. Come on now. Get out of here. Go away. Get up. Get on your feet. Get up. Get out of here, fuck off. Hurry up. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I want to welcome you all, family and friends, to this ceremony... in remembrance of the deceased, Mo Bouslimane. His son Ayoub wants to say a few words. Daddy... Daddy. I just want to... - We love you. - Yes, we love you. It's a shame we didn't get to spend more time together. I'll miss you. Are you okay? Yes. I know how it feels. My father was also a little bird. - Is the cake good? - Pretty good, man. I'm sorry. I'm really in love with Demi. I get it. Thanks for being here. Of course, come here. My condolences, madam. - Do you want some cake? - Yes, thank you. - I missed you, man. - Same here. - Good morning. - There you are. Take it easy, man. Now it's our turn, mom. Oh, this is Peter. Hi, hello. - Nice to meet you. - Ayoub. I should've warned you, sorry. - See you later on the square? - Yes. I have something to take care of. Well, he was in a hurry. Hi. Hi. Close your eyes for a second. For my princess. Do you want to go steady with me? Yes. - Can I ask you something else? - Yes. - Do you want to kiss me? - Yes. What was that? Come with me. I want you to meet my new girlfriend. - That's so cute. - Very sweet. - Oussi. - Hey, lovebirds. Oussi, you're crazy. Oussi is crazy. Guys, did you hear that? Boom.
