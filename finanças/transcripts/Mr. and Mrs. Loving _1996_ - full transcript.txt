You sure you gotta do this? Yeah. [tires screeching] [engine revving] [engine revving] [tires screeching] [women screaming] Stop it, stop it! [all shouting] Stop it! Richard, stop, goddamn it! Get in the house! Get in the house! Make you feel like a man, boy, huh? This a Blue neighborhood, boy! Yeah, go on in the house. [glass shatters] Jesus. Richard! Why did you do that for?! Richard, damn it, get out here! What did you do that for? Are you crazy? You must be going crazy, 'cause that man, he ain't done nothin' to you. Those are my friends, the only friends I got in this whole ugly rotten, rotten city. And you can't-- you ain't allowed to cause them no harm. They are my friends. Your friends, why do you think those people come over here in the first place? 'Cause they got nothing better to do, that's why. They love to come over here, sit on their fat asses, and listen to the country girl from the boonies tell all our goddamn family secrets. That ain't true. Blue, what the hell's he think he is, in some goddamn Sidney Poitier movie? But he's got you going, doesn't he? He can touch you and do-- He don't touch me! No, he's a goddamn pimp, for Christ's sake. Ain't you learn nothin' here? You! You ain't learned nothin'. Who reads the papers in this house? Who watches Cronkite in this house? Not you. You tell me what you know about our civil-rights struggle, which is what Blue walk on each and every day of his life. And because he's colored Negro and he dress fine, you wanna go and you wanna call him a pimp. Well, that is just too damn ignorant, Richard. Meanwhile, what do you do with your life? You leave me here to set here all alone. You don't care about me. You don't think about me! All you care about is your little silly goddamn racecar. I sold the goddamn car, okay? I sold the car 'cause I'm a man. And I take care of my family. And I work at that job every day for three years where every single day they call me "boy." And I watch you take that paycheck, go out and buy crap put on your face, so I'm ashamed to be seen in public with you. That ain't it. That ain't the truth. I'm gonna tell you exactly why you don't wanna be seen in public with me. It's because you ashamed to be seen with a black woman. Richard, don't you walk out on me! Richard! I'm pregnant. How long this check keep us? I don't know. Give you time to find another job? I don't know. What difference does it make? Were you gonna leave me? No. I don't wanna leave you, Bean. I wanna leave here. Where you wanna go? Home. They put us in jail if they catch us. Yeah, I know. What they do to Sidney? I don't know. You have to leave all your civil-rights stuff and your friends.

I think it's the only place in this whole damn world don't matter what color we are. Now, tell me I'm wrong. Tell me you don't see people staring at us that way. Colored, white, don't matter. All the same. Your friends, when they first seen me-- exact same way. And it ain't true, Bean. I ain't ashamed of you. Nope. I just-- I just can't bring myself to go out there anymore with you, have people looking at us that way. And you do know that look. You know that look, Bean.

[Sidney whimpering] Shh, shh. [knock on door] Mr. Loving? Richard Loving? My name is Bernie Cohen. I gave my card to your neighbor. You weren't here before, so, uh... Is this a convenient time? See, the thing is that I'm so busy these days, I can only come by after work. See? I'd ask you to my office, but it's in Virginia, you know, so. Is your wife here? She's the one who actually sent the letter. What letter? Letter, the one, uh, Bobby Kennedy. Bean! Bernie: So, um, you sent the letter, right, to Bobby Kennedy, and his office, they go through all his mail and they-- well, they read yours and they forwarded it onto the ACLU office in New York because there isn't one here, though there will be, you know. But anyway, I guess you could call me a stringer for the ACLU. Um, I have my own practice. You looking for a divorce? I'm kidding. [chuckles] Kidding. Uh, but anyway, I do as much pro bono work as I can for them. I believe in them, and I'd like to work full-time for them, but I just got married. And I bought a house, and the mortgage is killing me. So, so, so, so. So! I told them, "Sure." I just, you know, come by and meet you two, get the story, and see if there's anything, any legal basis that I can help you with, okay? You from the police? Uh, the ACLU, the American Civil Liberties Union. I'm sorry, I thought-- well, the letter, your letter, Mrs. Loving, was so eloquent that I-- I thought you were familiar with the legal... you know, the legal stuff. But you know what, that's not important. I'm a lawyer. I'm here to help you. The end. "Dear Mr. Kennedy, yesterday I seen Dr. King speak. I'm sure you seen it, too, and recall him talking about his dream that in our country, white folks and black folks should have the right to join their hands together. I'm a Negro woman, and my husband Richard is a white man. They arrested us because it is against the law in Virginia for us to marry. The judge made us leave the state, and now we live here in Washington, and we don't like it. I don't think it's anybody else's business who I marry as long as it don't hurt anybody. And we never hurt anybody in all our lives. Can you please help us? Sincerely yours, Mildred Loving." Did you both compose this? Uh, no, no, she-- Well... you certainly... This definitely got everybody's attention. But for me to help you, I have to hear the whole story. So just begin at the beginning, and I'm just gonna sit right here and I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just gonna listen. Okay? Well, I-- Go ahead. I known Richard all my life. And, uh, we started seeing each other and a while after, I-- She didn't know it was against the law, see, so I brought her here to get married. Because I knew we couldn't do it back home. And on our wedding night, that very same night, they come right in our bedroom. Now, we was naked. They came right in and took us to jail and left us there. They let Richard out the next morning. Wouldn't talk to me, wouldn't even look at me. You know, I asked them as they letting us out, and they just walk on by, slam the door, left me in another week. Now, it wasn't my fault, see? I told them to let her out. She didn't even know why she was in there. They didn't tell me. They didn't tell me nothin' till the trial. Didn't let me take no shower. Didn't give me no clean dress. It wasn't no real trial anyway. The old judge they had, he slept through most of it. He had his mind made up anyway. He gave some speech about God or something. What'd he say? He said, "God made the races separate on purpose," or some kind of bull, see? And then he sentenced us to one year-- One to three. That's right, in prison. And then he said he'd suspend it if we left the state. For 25 years. Twenty-five years in this place! Now, think about it. Think about that! I'd like to see that judge spend 25 days right here. And then, so, we, we... We came here. And, uh... That's it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um, thank you. That was, uh, very clear and... clear! That was-- that was... very clear. I'd like to... to think about it and, um, then, um, I'll get back to you. Okay? Uh, thank you. Okay, okay, okay, all right. This is what it is. I'm, uh, I'm like 95% sure about this, but what we have here is a Supreme Court case. [exhales] TheSupreme Court, you know, the one down the road? I don't mean the State Supreme Court, I mean-- we do have to go to the State first. You can't go to the Supreme Court without first going to the State. But that's, that's nothing. That's a formality. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm 28 and I have a Supreme Court case. You know, you talk about building a practice. But, um, anyway... let me just tell you, what they did to you... they can't do. Yeah, but they, uh-- No, I, I, I don't care if there's some law in some state which says they can. According to the Constitution of the United States of America, they can't do it. Believe me, it's a law from like-- it's one of the last chains from the slave days. It won't stand the test. It's gonna go down, you know, like a bomb. Boom! Okay. What we have to do is we have to go back to the same court. We have to start all over again. And we're gonna lose all over again. But that is exactly what we want because-- and this is the beauty of it-- because this is a civil-rights case. So the Supreme Court, the feds here, they have to hear it. They can't pass on it. It will go to them. Your case is gonna go to the Supreme Court. And it'll be overturned. All these racist laws will be wiped off the books. But does that mean that we-- Oh, yes, yes, I'm sorry. You know what, I, I-- Please, um, understand, I'm 28, you know, and this is the biggest thing that can happen to a lawyer. I said that already, didn't I? Whoo, I'm sorry. It means that your sentence is gone. It's over. And there's no ridiculous medieval banishment, no prison, no nothing. You go back home together. Free at last. Believe me. Thank you. Thank you. It's my pleasure. It's my honor. All right, well, that's all. That's all I can think of for right now. So, um, it's-- oh, great. I'm late again as usual. Um, thank you. It's-- it's been, uh... How long you think it'll take? Oh, uh, well, with a case like this, uh, you'd have to file for each one. You have to wait for a court date, and there's the research and the papers. Um... [exhales] You want the truth? Mm-hmm. A long time. How long? Years. And you have to be model citizens the whole time. You have to obey the laws. And you have to stay here. But, but... if you can do that... I will win this case for you. I will. It's a promise. Look, here's my card. It's got my number on there to office and home. All right? Call me. Will you call me? Okay. Listen... trust me. Okay. [panting] What, Bean? Oh, God, Richard, he said the Supreme Court. Yeah, he said a lot of things fast. Well, doesn't that mean-- I mean, if he's right and if he's good. Yeah, if he can stand it up here. Yeah, then we could go back home... together with our babies. And they couldn't do a thing about it, could they? I don't know. But I'd love to see it. I'd love to see that skinny old son-of-a-bitch judge just stand there and watch us walk down the street, just like that. Just like we own it. And him not allowed to open his mean, old wrinkled mouth. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'd love to see that, boy. I could die after I seen that. Hmm. Call him. Bean, it's 2:00 in the morning. Please? ♪♪ That's what I'll do.

Oh, yeah, sure we do, uh, Mr. Cohen. It's just, uh... well... I don't think we could stand being there. Okay. Richard: Mr. Cohen? Thank you. All right. [chorus humming] That these are the most odious laws to come before this court. They are not concerned with racial integrity or with racial supremacy. They rob the Negro race of its dignity. And only a decision which will reach the full body of these laws of the state of Virginia will change that. If the framers had intended to exclude anti-miscegenation statutes, it would have taken but a single phrase in the 14th Amendment to do so. But there is none. The language meant to include equal protection for Negroes. And with that equal protection comes the right to marry as any other human being has the right to marry. And that is the right of Richard and Mildred Loving. To wake up in the morning, to go to sleep at night knowing... that the sheriff will not be knocking on their door... or shining a light in their faces in the privacy of their bedroom. No matter how we attempt to emphasize the enormity of the injustices under this Virginia statute, no one can articulate it better than Richard Loving when he said to me, "Mr. Cohen, tell the court I love my wife and that it is just unfair. And I can't live with her... back home... in Virginia." I thank the Court.
