THE STORY OF TRIUMPHANT LOVE BASED ON THE SHORT STORY BY I make progress, you know. My teacher praises me. Maybe soon your portrait will be hung in some famous galery. It's Mucjusz. That's impossible. It cannot be Mucjusz. It must be some traveller. He comes back from a trip. And even if? I love you. Mr. Mucjusz. Fabiusz! My God, so many years... Five or six... You are mature now. - You seem to be grown up. - You went away all of a sudden. - We didn't know where to search for you. - Did you search for me, Fabiusz? Nothing tasted so good without you, nothing gave me joy. I owe to you everything I can do. - After my wedding... - After your and Waleria's wedding. After our wedding... - Are you happy? - Yes, I'm very happy. - If you came to... - Don't be childish, Fabiusz. She chose you, you were richer, she loved you. I have gone away and forgot, I have seen women of all races, I had the ones I wanted to. The most beautiful ones. Well... You bring me to life again. Waleria. It's Mucjusz! We'll give him the garden pavilion to make him feel comfortable. Maybe Mucjusz rented a room in the inn, maybe he was just passing through... Maybe... Ask him. You have changed so much... And me? I don't remember. I couldn't live for your money anymore, my friend, so I had to carry on trade. An Arabian sheikh offered me for this necklace his three fattest women. You gave us presents like you would like to buy us over. Maybe I wanted us to meet like equal people. Tell us. You must have seen extraordinary things. I have been to so distant countries that even their names seem to be unreal. I have seen the distant Persia, the happy Arabia, Egypt. I reached the mysterious China. I have seen the Ganges and the Lasse, mountains with everlasting snow. I was tortured in wet Malayan jungles while searching for traces of ancient temples. I brought him from there. He is mute and faithful. He saved my life. He swore that he would abandon me only after my death. This is Shirian wine. Extremely rare and aromatic. Its one drop is worth in the East as much as a drop of the most exquisite perfume. Drink it slowly. To my return. Let's rejoice over these few moments we spend together, friends. Maybe... You would like to stay with us? After all we are... Friends? What is he playing? It's a song about love. Far away, people believe that by listening to it, those who love can do unusual things. My servant will accompany you to your pavilion. You told me to come here. You have loved me through all these years. You couldn't forget. What is this? Leprosy. You live your last days... That's why you came here... Will you go away? Tomorrow. The day after tomorrow... In two days time... Were you walking? Did you come out? What a terrible dream I had, Fabiusz. Mucjusz! Don't take her away from me! She's my wife. I know I hurt you then, but without her... Without her... Mucjusz! Maybe you will tell me now, what a terrible dream you had last night. Mucjusz. - Mucjusz, wake up! - I'm going away. Let me say goodbye to her. Come in! Dear sir, Mr. Mucjusz is not well and wishes to move to the town. - How do you know? - Malaysian man told me so, sir. Malaysian man? But he is mute! He is a very strange boy, sir. - And the doctor? - Malaysian man forbade, sir. Son... It was my wish. You see... The irony is... that you killed someone who was already dead. Tell her... Mucjusz... I had to do this. I didn't want to, I couldn't... I didn't want you to take her away from me. As I took her away from you then. Those who love... can do unusual things. You coward... Coward... You coward!
