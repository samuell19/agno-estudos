Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Help! SEPTEMBER 2014 ALONE Am I a good person? Am I worth the effort you make for me. During that time, I thought about the times I didn't say sorry to the people I love. Why? If you have to say sorry so often, perhaps you're in the wrong. No? Hello. Are we still together? It's hot. We didn't bring water. Why am I here? So you can look at me? Memories? I had a complicated relationship with a seagull when I was here. I had a complicated relationship with everything, the seagulls, the tide, the litter. There are things I've never told anybody. See that rock? That's where I spent most of my time, going crazy with thirst. -I just wanted... -Don't tell me about your pain. OK, let's change the subject. Who was the guy? -A friend. -A special friend. I told you about him many times before. He's a sailor. He went to sea after the party. And? And he's gay. Why did you bring me here? I don't know yet. I'm getting old, man. This is all over for me. What is? This. Enjoy it while you can, kid. It's versatile, good for everything. I'm leaving. I've met someone. Dude! He's finally out of the closet. And... what's the lucky guy's name? She's Canadian. There aren't any waves in Canada. I think you need to get out more. Her name's Denise. You're serious? You were a free spirit. What happened? Age... Delayed maturity. Who knows. Someone has to look after me when I'm too senile to do it myself. Come on, she's good looking, right? Incredibly. Our grandpa Nelo is settling down. I can't believe it. Good for you! Cheers! -Cheers! -To you! Hey, mate. Aren't you happy for me? Of course. You know I'm going to miss you. You're very quiet. Is it because of Nelo? Your soul mate is leaving you. Yaiza. What? -It doesn't matter. -Tell me. Ona. That's a name that sinks ships and creates tsunamis. Forget about her. Me, however... Yaiza. That's the name of someone who just wants sex, and to make you laugh. You're not a weirdo, you just suffer because you can't have freedom and love. That's impossible. I chose freedom, it suits me for now. I just hope my tits aren't too saggy if I ever change my mind. Freedom or love, you know that. -You can't have it all. -But, I want it all. Hey, Pedro! How's it going? Yeah! Are we still together? -Ona, aren't you happy to see me? -You're drunk. Calm down, OK? Who are you? -Calm down. -Don't say that. Shut your mouth! I just want to talk. Let me go! You're a cute couple. Are you inviting me to the wedding? You humiliated me in front of everyone. You messed it up, Álvaro. Big time. Amazing Álvaro or idiot Álvaro, I never know which you'll be. What? Nothing. It's been good, no? It's nice to know there's someone more stupid than me. Take care with that girl, you're hurting her. Don't lecture me, Nelo. My father doesn't even lecture me. Chill out, man. You're on one of the most beautiful islands on earth. What's your problem with me? Is it because of Denise? Because I've got a new girl and you've not... Álvaro and his dramatic silences. You could use your drunkenness as an excuse to speak honestly. Fine. We made plans. We made plans, right? Yeah? We were going to surf half the world. And ride women around the other half. -That's it. -You can't have been serious? I love her, man. I can't control it, I feel like a fifteen year old. There's something else. I'm going to be a dad. Fuck me. A mini Nelo with a Quebecois accent. With a beard, a surf board... Can you imagine? This is goodbye then? Well... There are planes. Come and stay in Canada. We'll take you in as our shy and silent pet. After all, Fuerteventura isn't going anywhere. That's true. It's true. Surf half the world... It's one of those dreams that are never fulfilled. Where are you going? Indonesia, return flights. A house in Lambok, eight weeks. Sometimes plans come together. Shit, man. -Come here. -Don't touch me. Come here. I've let you down. Forgive me. You've not let me down. It's much worse. You've fallen in love. -Your breath smells terrible. -Yours too. What should I do with you now? With me, nothing. Enjoy an eight-week honeymoon with your girl. No, Álvaro, no. I don't want them. It was your plan. It's just money. See you at low tide. Beautiful. You have three messages. Álvaro, what's up? It's Saul. Sorry it's early, but I've got some good news. The bosses have agreed to look at your apartment plans. They think it's fantastic. So, it's not a yes, but... it's a yes. Call me and we'll discuss it. Or we can have dinner when you're back in Madrid? You're paying! How did you feel this morning, buddy? Listen, let's catch some waves before I leave. So, call me when you can. When you're ready, you know. Hey, little brother. How's life? It's Saturday, so I guess you're hiding from tourists in one of those secret places only you know about. If today is Saturday, yesterday was... Friday, fifth of September 2014. Shit! Don't worry. I'll turn 34 another time so you can celebrate with me. I spoke to mum, she misses you. We know you're trying to find yourself and all that... But, you could call sometimes, right? Dad's got worse, weaker. He's struggling with the heat. Pain, bad moods, you know how it is. Well... that's everything. I know you hate being lectured. I love you, kid. I miss you. The tide's coming in. If you die... they eat your eyes first. And that's not all. You don't even need to be dead. If they think you're defenseless, they attack. Those bastards attack. Get out of here! There's nothing to see here! That wasn't difficult. I'm thirsty. You're looking at me. No! Can I carry on? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. I don't like blood. Nor your stories about seagulls eating eyes. I just want you to be honest for once. -I'm explaining what happened. -I already know. Why am I here? I want to know why you brought me here. Two years ago, you made me dinner in the dunes. You said we'd see a special star or something. The new moon. That was it. Those things you say just to lead me astray. I was exhausted. I had a meeting first thing the next day. I couldn't keep my eyes open. But I still did it. I took you across the island. You didn't see me, but I spent half the journey with my head on the window, snoring. I heard you. When you said we had to cross the bloody sand dune desert... I almost killed you. You tricked me! Sorry. My plan was perfect. A candlelit dinner behind the last dune. A candlelit dinner behind the last dune, under a new moon. While we were eating, when I looked at the flame, I imagined you planning it all. Travelling so far just to light it. If you'd asked me to jump off a cliff with you that night, I'd have done it. I'm not in love anymore. It took me a long time to stop loving you. I think I've done it. Freedom or love, you know that. You can't have it all. THE POWER OF THE PRESENT Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help! And the stomach pain? Muscle spasms. I was bleeding internally. The broken bones of my pelvis dug into me with every movement. My body was telling me to stop moving, if I didn't want to fuck it up. And then? The spasms kept coming back. I was getting tired. Those screams would put fear into you. The tide's coming in. You should hurry. Listen, dying takes time. I made some progress. I went into spasm. I went under. I was screaming, swallowing water... Then I'd briefly reach the surface again. It went on, over, and over, and over again... Until I decided to give up. I said goodbye to everyone. To you, as well. I said sorry. Sorry for what? For everything. That's not enough. You were about to die, be more specific. Everything is everything. I know what this is about. You want me to say what you're incapable of saying. That's why I'm here. Sorry for what? For generally being a dick? For cheating? You didn't think to mention you weren't in love with me. Small insignificant detail. For wasting two years of my life. You're forgiven. And yet... If I asked you, you'd come back to me. But, you won't do that. I don't know what happened down there. I felt sad. I was scared... of being alone. I'm scared of being alone. I always have been. I'm not what you're looking for. We both need to start from zero, away from this cove. You've got so many things to say to so many people. That's why you have to live. Start from scratch. Remember that when you see me. Get me out of your head. You shouldn't get up! It'll hurt. Watch out for the seagulls. Ona! Ona! Ona! 24 HOURS AFTER THE ACCIDENT Help me! Help me! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Beautiful. Oh God, God, God! Hey! Hey! I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. Son of a bitch! Come here! Come back if you dare! Eat your bloody fish, or whatever the hell you eat! I'm still alive! I'm alive. -Mum, dad! - Hello, love. I've had an accident. I need help. -Listen... -I fell off a cliff and... My hip's broken, I can't walk. Of course, you want lots of things, but if we carry on like this... Will you listen to me for a moment? Mum, will you listen to me for once? When... When you come back to Madrid, call us before you arrive, we've got a surprise for you... I love you. I love you, dad. I don't think I've ever told you. This years have passed by, and we've never said it. Hey, sis! Have you seen that I'm talking to mum and dad like you wanted? You got your way. If I stay here, I'll die. I'm hallucinating. Because I'm dying of thirst. I've tried drinking my own urine, but... it was full of blood. Come on! Come on! Come on! What are you waiting for? Come on! You don't want to die. You don't want to die. You don't want to die. Dude! I've been missing you. How was your day? I've been here, sunbathing. I see that you've brought backup. What a son of a bitch. Get out of here! There's nothing to see here! Help! It's not easy to accept that you'll die... completely alone. I was so scared of dying like that, with all that guilt inside me. I didn't want to be someone's toxic memory. You told me you'd fallen in love, that you're going to be a dad. Instead of being happy for you, I was jealous. I was jealous of a girl... I've never met. Who, I'm sure, is lovely. And of a baby that hasn't even been born. And, if it is anything like you, it'll be amazing. A mini Nelo, with a beard and a surf board. I can't live like that. A selfish, arrogant idiot. I haven't hugged my father for years. I love him. I love him so much. But, because of arrogance, the years pass by... and I don't do it, even though I want to. I've never been in love. You know what I'm like, Nelo. I like Ona because she's perfect. It should be forbidden to not love someone like that. If she can't do it, no one can. I think that's why... she came to save me. Not from that cove, but from myself. I have to let her go. Even though it hurts. I get it now, Nelo. I've learnt I can be alone... and survive. Yes. AFTER 48 HOURS MISSING, HE WAS RESCUED TWO KILOMETRES OUT AT SEA ALONE Say something to your future self. I'm alive.
