Originally shot on 8mm and transferred to 16mm. This subtitle simulation mastered from a VHS copy Summer, 1977 Filmed by Ogawa Production This is a documentary film about raising silkworms. Will you tell me the old tale? The tale about the silkworm, I mean. Old tale of the silkworm Once upon a time there was a great feudal lord. He had a beautiful daughter. The daughter liked riding horses very much. Every day she went out riding. She particularly enjoyed ranging far on horseback. One day the river was swollen. Her parents told the daughter not to go out. But she insisted on doing so. She disobeyed her parents and went out on her horse. At first she enjoyed the ride. But on the way home it poured rain. The roads were flooded. The poor lass did not know what to do. Night was fast approaching. The rain fell relentlessly. She decided to head for home anyway. While she was walking home alongside her horse, the flood waters began to rise, higher and higher. The water rose higher than her horse. Neither she nor the horse arrived home that day. The lord was wracked with anxiety. He set out to find her in the terrible storm. He made his way along the river. But he found no trace of his daughter nor her mount. Finally he came across a mulberry tree on the riverbank with a worm sitting on a leaf. The worm was enormous. He had never seen a worm such as this. He thought to himself... This worm must be the incarnation of my daughter. The worm didn't try to flee, but stayed put on the leaf. The lord took the leaf with the worm on it. He looked very carefully at the worm And found a pair of horse-shoe shaped marks. He believed that both his daughter and the horse had died at this spot. And that the horse had tried to protect her. Thereafter, the lord carefully raised the worm. The worm grew into a cocoon. It became a moth which we call "Shiro" or "White." The White later gave birth to many larvae. Believing they were incarnations of his daughter, the lord carefully nurtured them. Magino Story Sericulture Raising silkworms This is a "nail" that we pluck the mulberry leaves with. We pluck soft leaves for the autumnal larvae and late autumnal larvae. We feed them this for one week after birth. We pluck the soft leaves with this nail. How to Pluck Young Leaves First we place the nail on the leafstalk like this. Then pull it. The reason why we pluck like this is because it would damage the stalk if we just pulled the leaf. That would remove the bark or skin from the stalk. It is important to pluck carefully using the nail. Tomorrow the larvae will be deliverd here. We are collecting mulberry leaves for them now. This is Sato Kimura. She's going to teach us about larvae. Thank you for joining us. Pleased to be here. Tomorrow we will welcome the newly born larvae. We call these young larvae "Chisan." The leaves we pluck will feed the Chisan. These leaves we call "rat-ridders." These rat-ridding leaves go to feed larvae that are raised from mid-July to the end of August. We call these larvae, "early autumnal larvae." We feed rat-ridders to early autumnal larvae. We also feed them another variety called "Ichinose." Today we'll talk about "rat-ridders." Which leaves should we pluck from this branch for the larvae we are expecting? These bright, shiny leaves which we pluck one by one. "Bright shining leaves" They're found here, at the tips of the plants. See how the top leaves are all closed, not open. Underneath them we can find the first open leaves. Look closely here... This leaf has just about grown into the regular mulberry leaf shape. We call it the "most shining leaf." See the light green leaves around the top of the branch. Reflecting the sunlight, they appear the most shiny. Perhaps that's why they were given this name. It also serves as a marker to distinguish other leaves which we'll show later. This leaf, we call the "beckoning" or "drawing leaf." For larvae which have just hatched in a box, we use these leaves to draw them from the box. From there into a basket in which we raise them. Hence it's the "beckoning" or "drawing leaf." Four or five leaves below the most shining leaf, excepting this one, we count one, two, three, four and five. These fourth and fifth leaves are fed to one larva, three days after it has hatched. Why so careful when choosing leaves? Is it because of nutrients in the leaves? Yes, it is. This leaf is the softest, and contains appropriate nutrients for the young larvae. We must choose soft leaves because the young larvae cannot bite into hard leaves. They must have soft ones. The top leaves are soft, but they do not contain enough nutrients for the young silkworms. Those four or five leaves contain digestive nutrients for the young silkworms. That is why we choose the 4th and 5th leaves, under the most shining leaf, for three day old worms. I notice you arrange the leaves in your hand. What's the secret of that? Well, the secret is... In order not to damage the leaves they must be handled carefully. Otherwise they get bruised and wrinkled. So it's also difficult to cut them if they're not in order. The leaves would be wrinkled at feeding time. That's why they're laid carefully in order. This is how to store mulberry leaves to be fed to 1st or 2nd molt silkworms. You can see by looking at this... After the leaves are plucked they're piled in order. We lay leafstalk upon leafstalk and tip on tip. This is how we arrange them. We must feed them fresh leaves. It is quite difficult to keep them fresh. We must not feed wet leaves to 1st, 2nd or 3rd molts. An important point for up to the 3rd molt is to feed them fresh leaves but not wet leaves. They're laid on a damp, wrung out cloth. We also cover the leaves with a similar wet cloth. We must remember that the leaves are also alive. They breathe while emitting moisture. The cloth under the leaf absorbs the moisture. It also provides moisture which stops them drying out. Mrs. Sato Kimura, our teacher of sericulture It was just after W.W.II, in 1946, when she was married to Mr. Kimura, scion of a well-known family in this area near Magino village. Wedding photo, 1946 At that time his parents were engaged in sericulture. Sato was merely helping with the work. Her job was to pluck mulberry leaves for the larvae. As they became older, Sato took over the task. In those days... It was far different, as sericulture was an important source of income. To succeed to that role meant asusming responsibility as the sole income provider. So it was a noteworthy event for Sato. She tells us how she began her job. The day you took over, a fire broke out in the village. Could you describe that day? Well, I was sitting eating breakfast. Many visitors came to give greetings and also to show their sympathy. In those days, in cases of fire in the village, such visits were not only to the unforturates who'd experienced the fire. But also to all the others in the same village. So they extended their sympathies to everyone? It's all written here in this letter. Visitors came to my house to pay their respects. And express sympathy for the fire? So your family would have been busy receiving visitors after the June 1, 1966 fire. Traditionally they must also pluck tea leaves. June marks the middle of vernal sericulture. Yes, the worms had just finished their 3rd molting. These days it's called the 4th molting. It was the busiest season for mulberry harvesting. Yes. I was ever so busy. Father-in-law had to pluck tea leaves, and deal with the visitors at the same time. He said, "You look after the silkworms." I didn't know much about the details then. I asked him what leaves I should pluck. "Any which look suitable." He said. Sato took over responsibility for sericulture. July 19, 1977 first (one) molt silkworm We're going to give the "drawing leaf." These larvae have just hatched. There are 20 thousand in all. Wow! So many! We find larvae even on the lid. Hereabouts, we use "moyokeru" to mean "hatched." The silkworm is only a few millimeters long. We cut leaves into one centimeter squares so the larvae can easily eat and also climb the leaves. Being fed with "drawing leaves" Larvae stick firmly to the bottom of the box. They'll soon start to climb up onto the leaves. Larvae are far too small to pick up in the hand. And too delicate to be manhandled. We transfer them by letting them climb the leaves. Why do you use chopsticks? The leaves are so small that they're easily damaged. We use sterilized chopsticks to handle the leaves. Silkworms move from the box to the mulberry leaves. An hour passed since we first gave them "drawing leaf." Can we see the larvae now? See all the silkworms on the "drawing leaves." They're on both sides of the leaves. There are a very few left in the box. We now begin what we call "sweeping." Note the worms on the leaves. To sweep, we use chopsticks and a feather broom. These are the feather broom and the chopsticks. If you wouldn't mind showing us how. I sweep the remnants onto the heaped leaves. This task is called "sweeping." May I discard this? Try not to sweep egg shells onto the heap. We spread the heap into a 30 cm square. You make a 30 cm square of silkworms and leaves. You spread them very evenly, don't you? That's right. As flat as possible. - A very thin layer. - Thin and flat. This allows them to easily climb onto the leaves. That's right. I've heard that "sweeping" is quite difficult. I guess it depends on the person, but how long does it take to become a good "sweeper"? It's very similar to learning how to cook rice. Although three years may not really be enough, it's just about right. So you learn how to do it naturally? That's right. After "sweeping" the leaves are "fed." As Sato advised, this basket contains 120 grams of leaf. It is 20% heavier than usual. This is how she feeds the larvae at this stage. We are now feeding them 120g of leaf for the first time. It is difficult to feed each worm equal amounts. Mainly because the silkworms are so tiny. So we must cut the leaves into pieces. Then the silkworms can easily climb up and eat leaves from any direction. That's how I cut the leaf for them. So these worms, only a few millimeters long, can eat either the ends or the tips of the leaves. Besides, it's easy for me to sprinkle leaf over the larvae. Sato shows how to sprinkle leaf. Do you have any secrets for sprinkling leaf? Well, actually I do it in my own way, so... Take leaves like this. First, sprinkle over the area with the most silkworms. Don't grab too many or you'll damage the leaf. I was taught to grab gently. You feed enough so you can't see the head of the larvae. Each and every silkworm must be fed uniformly. Be careful not to leave some under-fed. Especially when they are small. You must also be careful when they get bigger. For one molt silkworms, newspaper sashes are prepared. This is newspaper I dampened this morning. Is it wet enough? Yes, it's just right. Please show us how. There are not many leaves, so we surround them with wet paper to give moisture. We use wet newspaper like this so that they won't dry out. This is just for one night? Yes, just like this. Covered with wax paper Is this how? No air comes through. Since no air can enter or leave, moisture and temperature are evenly maintained. The silkworms inside have fresh mulberry leaves. Shall I take this back to the shelf? This task should be done after the silkworms arrive. At 6 pm we do what we call "spreading." In just one day they've grown much bigger. We next "spread" their habitat. Many of them are emerging. It's almost completely black. Yes, and they've grown so much, too. "Spreading" the area where the silkworms are raised. Now we need to spread the area where we raise them. By how much do you spread it? About 10 cm. That's 10 cm in all directions. We must get rid of the moisture at the bottom. Put chopsticks down in there. They reach to the bottom, then we pull out, or spread, from the center. At the same time it introduces fresh air. That avoids too much moisture concentrating. Stuffy and stale air is bad for 1st and 2nd molt worms. Fresh leaves emit too much moisture, don't they? That's right. Is this enough? Looks good. Just about right, I think. Later we feed them more. That's the first day's work. So many of them all over the leaves! Those on the leaves have eaten sufficiently. Silkworms hibernate four times and cast off four times. In each incarnation they get bigger. It's the third day of the first molting. Now it's time for their first sleep. They will sleep from now. We are now spreading an area for the sleeping larva. This is the last job for first molt silkworm. This larva is now sleeping. When most of the larvae strike a pose like this, we re-spread the area set aside for them. Sato advises drying the area while they sleep. While doing this, I concentrate only on the drying. I see. While they are sleeping, They're not covered with wax paper. That's right. Dryness encourages the larvae to cast off. Some people cover them even while they're sleeping. My mother taught me just to dry, not cover. So far I've managed to obey her strictures. By the time the leaf is completely dry, the larva will wake. With wet leaf they don't wake up. The sericulture experts advise us to put on a heater and open the windows while they're sleeping. We need to put this back on a higher shelf. The most difficult work continues for one week after the initial "sweeping." Only some people in the village do "sweeping." Why do you still "sweep?" I'm not satisfied if I don't do it myself. I don't want to leave it to others to do the job. Many farmers let the textile companies care for them during this troublesome stage. I like watching them grow under my care and feeding. It's like a hobby. I enjoy watching them every day. I don want anyone else looking after them. So they're quite dear to you? I love just watching them. 2nd molt silkworm After the first cast-off... They've now cast-off their shells. They look all wrinkled. See that head movement? They want mulberry leaf. They're searching for mulberry leaf. 99% of them are now awake. The next step is called "gathering." What's the purpose of this? If we feed them mulberry just as it is, we'd need much more leaf to sprinkle it evenly. Plus the leaf is also likely to dry up more easily. So we need to gather them at the center. So, if they're spread widely, like this, we'd need more mulberry leaf to feed them evenly? And it would dry out much quicker. Many sericulturists don't do this particular sequence. But Sato never fails to do it. Using a mesh for 2nd molt and older worms. This woven mesh is used in many and various ways. When the larvae awake from their sleep, or when we must clean the area around them. We put them on here and carry them around. When feeding 1st molt larva, we sprinkle the leaf. This time we place the leaves one by one. Are there any points to remember when doing this? We should not pile the leaf too thickly, so the larvae can climb easily. You need to place each leaf separately. The surface should be even. Points to remember Why do you place leaves back side down? Because the front is slippery for the larvae. The larvae are so tiny. It's hard for them to climb. This side, as you can see, is rather coarse. Tiny larvae climb it more easily than a smooth surface. That is why we always place them back side down. And it seems there are more nutrients on this side. After giving new mulberry leaf Look at these larvae. They have climbed onto the new leaf. All the larvae are already on new leaves, so we can easily discard the old leaves. After you make sure that the larvae are on new leaves, you lift this basket, and move the basket with larvae on it to a new location. All larvae have moved onto the leaves given yesterday. The 2nd day of the 2nd molting sequence. What is "okidaki"? All 2nd molt larvae are awake and on the leaves. These are old leaves on which the larvae slept. There are very few still left here. Today we transfer the basket to a new location. The job of transferring larvae from the old to a new basket is called "okidaki." Larvae are all transferred to a new basket. No more left here. She discards the excrement and the old leaves. This must be done every day from two molts onwards. Feeding new leaf We give them more leaf than before. How much is suitable? I overlap one leaf over half of another leaf. We are now giving new leaves to the larvae. Overlapping half of a leaf with another leaf. Tonight we're piling one leaf over another. According to the rate of growth she feeds leaf twice or three times a day. Put yourself in place of the larva. My attitude here is to imagine if I were a larva what sort of attention would I want? You imagine yourself as if you were a larva? When stuffy, give fresh air... Always keep the temperature at a moderate level. This is how my mother-in-law taught me to do it. The larvae moving around eating are not ready to sleep. Look at this. These still larvae have already gone to sleep. As soon as they start sleeping, they're transferred to a new basket. The transferred larvae get comfortable. After they eat their fill of leaves they just want to sleep comfortably. We call this condition, "daku." We are preparing to let them sleep in comfort. Selecting sleeping larvae I have to pick up larvae from these old leaves. If we look carefully... there you go. There are various types, and some are quite hasty. Some are not. It depends on the year they're born. We often see these hasty larvae. Larvae from last year The autumnal larvae last year were very restless. They struggled when I fed them. They loved eating so much. Watching them was fun. It really made me laugh. Larvae are like man. Some are restless, some aren't. I found a slow larva like me and it made me laugh. What do you think of these? They're relatively calm. Very quiet, are they? Every year larvae are different. I sometimes find larvae making a fuss. It is interesting. Once every three years I find the larvae very restless. Third molt larva How to pluck leaf for 3rd molt larva How do I pluck for 3rd molt? Remember? These three leaves are for 1st molt. And 7 down from the shiny leaves were for 2nd molt. So above here is... for 1st molt. Above this leaf are for 2nd molt. We didn't pick these hard leaves. For 3rd molt we only select leaves from above... this dark green stalk here. I believe these are the best ones now. Leaves off this dark green stalk are suitable for 3rd molt larvae. Plucking leaves without using the "nail" If I do it like this, the bark will come off. So pull it to the side. That's right. Why do you pluck upwards? If I started from the top, it would be natural. I'd pull the leaf downwards. But it's not a "pull," it's more of a "pluck" from the side. We pluck gradually, from soft down to harder leaves. They'll eat soft to harder leaves on the stalk. Third molt larvae eat this entire basket of leaves. It's quite warm. The leaves are warm. Avoiding too much moisture You stand the leaves like this. Like a field. The leaf won't warm up if I stand it like this. Better than this... The leaf should be standing. To make room for air circulation. This plastic sheet should be...? Yes, it should be turned inside out each time. By doing this, it dries out the moisture on this side. Disinfect larvae after hibernation. This prevents screlosis, doesn't it? This disinfectant is for aspergillus and sclerosis. Sclerosis once killed all the larvae in the village. This drug dries out the baskets. Right. It contains lime to dry out the baskets. You tie it as high up as possible. It's easier to sprinkle it when you tie higher. Any order in sprinkling? From edge to center, like drawing a spiral. When it looks like frost, that's plenty. From edge to center, like drawing a spiral. After that, they're looking for leaf to eat. Every one of them is moving its head. They're all quite hungry now. They've grown bigger and become 3rd molt now. The next basket should be bigger. Must we split them into equal halves? Yes, about half in each. You transfer half of them to another basket? And the other half to another basket? Six baskets are split into 12 baskets in all. It's easier if I put my thumbs under here. Did you learn this from your mother? She said I must do exactly what she told me. She admonished me never to forget. So she really wanted you to work hard? She said I should never run from trouble. And I should follow the process just as she taught me. That looks good. Put those larvae back. Bring those at the edges to the center. Otherwise they'll get less leaf to eat. There are many at the edge. If I leave them as is, I'm bound to forget. Sometimes I come across larvae with no leaf. So I'm always careful about it. They grow so fast that food intake is very important. That looks good now. You often talk about their eyes. What do you mean by that? By now I am quite used to dealing with larvae. After looking at larvae all day, I gradually came to distinguish... the eye which tells whether it is hungry or not. You can actually tell the difference? At first they all look the same, but after a while you can tell what the larva wants. What about at first? Could you tell then? I didn't have a clue! Not even an inkling. After feeding I knew they were hungry. They struggle towards the smell of mulberry leaf They're busily moving about. They're really quite hungry. They can't wait. Like kids waiting for sweets. That's so true. Look at this one! It's climbing for food! They let you know if they want food or space by releasing thread. And by climbing up it. They're starting to make holes. They're sticking their heads out through the holes. It's like eating out a window frame. I can hear them crunching away. They all have good appetites. The hole looks just like a window. Each one makes one. They eat so quickly. They were hungry. Appetite's a good sign. Aren't they lovely? When she opened the door of the main room, the larvae knew she'd come and instantly became silent. She was very close to them. They must have been very hungry at the time. Suddenly they were happy and started their dance. Young Sato and silk Silk has been a big part of my life. But we could never afford to buy anything made of silk. So I made clothes from my cocoons. Like my mother did for me. She'd spin her cocoons, dye and then weave them. She sewed trousers, underwear even a formal cloth. I still have a wrapping cloth from 30 years ago. It's your treasure. She also made my school uniform from her silk. These are all pure silk. Every one of them. Everyone envied me. They were so lustrous. The sound of silk rustling as I walked was wonderful. My clothes shone, but I didn't. Plucking mulberry for 4th molt larva Thank you for joining us today. Today they will wake and become 4th molt larva. In this area, 4th molt are actually called "3rd molt." Because they've slept and woken three times. Sato's husband, Shuichi Kimura For 4th molt larva any leaf is okay, even those in the shade. All the larvae have by now grown well. So we must give them enough leaves to eat. Never run out. No time for careful plucking now. I notice that these leaves here have been plucked all the way from here to here. They're for 1st molt larva. For 2nd and 3rd molt, we plucked this way. Sato explained all that earlier. Today, leaves from brown stalks are to be plucked. Yes, you can pluck up to around here. - They ate a lot. - Indeed. Looks like they've licked down to the leafstalks. Are they satisfied? I'd say so... During 4th molt, only plucking and feeding are done. Look. See their heads sticking up. So, they're asleep now. The mouths all swollen. We say when the mouth is swollen, soon they'll sleep. They look fresh with their heads up. All those little round heads bobbing up. Yes. Like flowers. They're lovely. Best time of all. They're just like flowers. So cute. It makes me feel good. I'll show my husband. Like little Tokyo Towers I'm happy to see them all sleeping. It means they're all growing up nice and healthy. So pretty because they're all the same size. In this humid weather both silkworms and man are working hard to make cocoons. 5th molt larva We need more baskets than before. It was only two weeks ago that they first arrived. 20,000 larvae in one basket. Now, all the shelves are full. If I count from the bottom of row one, there are, 7, 8, 9... altogether 11 baskets. One basket became 44 baskets in two rows. When shelves become full, we take them to a different nursery. Feeding becomes much easier, too. Raising larvae outside Around here? Start from the opposite side. Too many over this side. Add some here to make it even. They're still light, so they can take the shock. From the other side, right? Keep the density constant. This silkworm nursery is called "Yoshijima style." This is used to raise mature larvae. Its width is about 150 cm. Its length is 5.5 meters. Each one holds 10,000 silkworms. We have 20,000, so we built two. Feeding From today we start including twigs. We also feed narrow soft stalks to the larvae here, because they're sufficiently grown by now. As you can see here, so far we've fed them individually plucked leaves. Now they'll eat twigs, too. Feed them from here... and from here. Pile them alternately. I see. Like this? Yes, alternately. Alternating tips and butt ends in a crosshatch. So all the larvae get an equal amount of leaf. Plucking twig for 5th molt is mainly a man's job. Are mulberry trees easily damaged? In old times, when we had little fertilizer, they broke very easily. So fertilizer is essential. I notice you're cutting them quickly, now. Always removing any unnecessary twigs. Is that those thin, weak ones? That's the ones. Do you now add more to each bundle? Yes. That's right. We need all of them except those three in the middle. Pre-feeding work We are now raising the larvae outside. Feeding them branches as is, like this... creates a lot of spaces between for the larvae. That allows them to climb onto the next leaf to eat. Sometimes they're piled up over the top. In that case some larvae fall out of the trays. In order to avoid that, we shorten the branches. I hold it upside down, and cut around here. These short bits are easier for the larvae to eat, Then into equal piles. This means that each larva can get an equal amount of leaf. This bit is not needed. It has no leaves left. It's not needed so we just discard them. These short bits are needed. We pile them on the larvae. 5th molt larva (the biggest eaters) Five days after the larvae become 5th molt, they eat the equivalent of their cocoon weight. So, in order to get 400 kg of cocoons, we must feed them 400 kg, three times a day. That helps them to make good cocoons. So, for four days we must feed them 400 kg of leaf. After 8 days of 5th molt, we decrease it to one meal. Then the larvae get ready to start their cocoons. The amount of leaf that a larva eats at one time, is equal to the weight of its cocoon. The biggest eaters Can you pull that to the center, please? That looks good to me. It's 3 pm. The sunlight is at its strongest now. The temperature must be 33°C or 34°C. In the shade of this nursery, it is less than 31°C. The best temperature range is 20°C to 26°C. Up to 26°C the larva will eat a lot. At higher temperatures larvae do not eat much. How to improve eating volume. The leaves actually bring down the temperature. To make it cooler here, we feed them four times. Usually they're fed three times, but we've added one feed. At 10 or 3 o'clock like teatime. That makes a total of four feeds in all. You can do it at 10 am, like morning tea, but feeding at 3 pm, the hottest part of the day, is best. Larvae eat more in cooler conditions. This one extra feeding is to adjust the temperature. The amount of leaf a larva eats at this time, affects the size of the cocoon. So we must let them eat a lot. In this humid weather, the larvae lose appetite. The point is to get them to eat as much as possible. Yes, it's very important. During this 5th molt, it's most important. We usually give leaf three times a day. But at this stage we feed them four times daily. This is about right. Look at that! They're so quick! They're making holes and peeping out of them. They're climbing the leaves as they continue eating. This is when the larvae eat the most. Look at them eating! After each meal they get noticeably bigger. I hope they'll make big cocoons. Such a funny face. Apparently it's not really a face. It's markings to protect them against enemies. It is a half past six and 24°C. We've finished feeding them. It's time to close down. - Close all sides? - Yes, please. Yes, all around. Take out the center pole. They continue eating. Good work. Look at those leaves! We've just brought a load. Look at this! It looks as if we're running a mulberry farm. They weigh about 150 kg. There are a dozen bundles. They eat all of this in one day. It's surprising to see just how quickly they eat. Look a the leaves in the basket. This is the amount of leaf they were fed at first. Quite a difference. It's just 300 grams. If you compare this 300g with this 150kg, you easily note their progress. Larvae grow in proportion to the amount they eat. Compared with tiny larvae that looked like hairs, They've grown 7,000 to 10,000 times that size. After eating a little more, they'll be ready to cocoon. The 22nd day They appear ready to make cocoons. - How about this one? - It's ready. It looks a bit red. That means it's ready to start on its cocoon. This one almost... this one needs more time. This one is one stage behind. Just comparing, I can easily see if they're ready. So those which are smaller and looking up are looking for a place to make their cocoon? That's right. It's a game of "ready or not!" Larvae which are ready, cut down on leaf intake. We must transfer them to the cubicle immediately. So we need to distinguish if they're ready or not. Characteristics of larvae which are ready Those which are ready to start the cocoon process are a little bit shorter than the others, like this. They swing their heads very gently. And the color? They become translucent, like candy. This one still has mulberry leaf in its body. This one has already digested and its body is filled with silk. This one looks translucent, and moves its head around very gently. Do they feel different? The immature one is hard. The mature one is soft. It's softer because its body is full of silk. We are picking out larvae which are ready to transfer to the cubicles. What should I remember when picking them up? You have to take care not to damage their feet. You mean I shouldn't pull so hard? Is this the right way to pick them up? The mature ones are very fat and round. So you don't need to be too careful. Will you show me how to pick them up? First of all, pick larvae from the top. Then pick ones lower down, under the leaves. Pick from the top down... That's how. Hold them vertically, so you don't damage them. How do you do that? Then you hold them like this... lengthways. Pick up by the head and pull to the end? Doesn't have to be the head. Just hold them like this. Lengthways, like a rope. Twenty faces all in a row. They're all posing for the camera. All struggling to become stars. Especially this one. He's very eager. Look at them. So full of life. This one is handsome. They all are. This one's weak. He needs nurturing. Good day. Where are you off to? Just taking a walk. You mentioned you can discern their health. Can you explain what you look for? When I'm checking to see whether or not the larvae are ready yet, I also take a quick look at where the worm excretes. Here? The excrement looks green through the skin. If it's green, the larva is in good condition. It will produce a cocoon. Grab one of these. Coming through. When ready to cocoon, they're transferred to racks The next day... We brought them in here yesterday. It was like pouring them in. But none remain on the bottom. Does that mean they've all climbed up into the racks? Instinct makes them seek a suitable place to gestate. Looking for a place to make the actual cocoon? Each cell becomes a home for one silkworm. Shall we hang them? What's this black stuff? That's their excrement. They do as they climb up the rack? No. Before they start on the cocoon, they must expel unneeded things within the body. So they only keep what is needed to produce the silk? Otherwise they would soil the cocoon. Once the larva has thoroughly cleansed itself, it starts work on the cocoon. Revolving racks This top part becomes heavy, so... it naturally revolves on its own weight. As the larvae climb, the weight at the top increases, which sets the revolving cycle in motion. Larvae will always climb to a higher position. So this rack uses that instinct to our advantage. An offering to the Goddess of Mercy? What is this chant? It's a chant in praise of the Goddess of Mercy. We gather once a year to pray for a bountiful harvest. You have time now because the larvae don't need feeding. Yes, it's our free time now. We pray for a good harvest and good health for next year. I see. Thank you. For one week the larvae continue making the cocoon. Bon Festival of ancestral worship, August 15 Shuici Kimura Hajime Kimura Has this area always been called Magino? No, it used to be divided into Shimo (Lower) Magino, and Kami (Upper) Magino. Now this area is a cleared, and productive plain. But it used to be all overgrown and forested. So what is now known as Azuma village, used to be part of a much larger Magino? That's right. People were livng here 4000 years ago. Jomon earthenware from that period was dug up in the school grounds. Our primary school teacher used to let us go and search for stone arrowheads in and around the farms in the village. Stone arrows? Just the arrowheads. You could sell them to collectors. Also fragments of tiles and other earthenware, too. We'd find them all the time when I was a kid. So people have lived here all that time, have they? In those days they were hunters and gatherers. Then there's a gap where we don't know if they stayed on. So no one's sure if it's been continuously inhabited? We do know that in the (1193-1330) Kamakura era they erected memorial stones to the ancestors... Or else in memorial to the various clans and families. You can find many such stones in this area. Down at Hara, in an area close to the temple there. And also in and around Dankyo. There's a stone guardian with six gods. There used to be two of them in Magino Village. This one is not damaged. It's still there. The other one was so badly worn that it was removed. About 600 years ago? Yes, 600 years is about right. They prove the area was inhabited in those days. And people have lived here ever since. I heard you also have a very old document. Kimura Family Record This is the oldest surviving record of the family. One is 300 years old and the other is 250. 300 years ago... My family is one of the oldest in the district. We can trace our line back through various cadet branches of the main family. So you mean...? They'd break off from the main family. We're now the 5th cadet branch of that line. All 5 lines share our great great great grandparents. Hajime Shuichi's firstborn son This is the oldest surviving record of our family. It gives place names which are still in use. For example, Yashikina, Ura, Nakamichi. I can't read this part. But here Joden (Upper field) and Chuden (Middle field). These refer to the quality of the land. This part here is a bit too difficult to decipher. The final part gives the total sum of the fields. Altogether we held some 2.92 ha. of prime land. My father found this in an old storage warehouse. According to this, our ancestor was a samurai warrior. 300 years ago, all was stable under the Tokugawa shoguns. This area was under Lord Matsudaira's control. It goes on to list who came before and who ruled then. The name Yohei was handed down the generations. After Buei died, the Kimura family hid in Magino. Presumably others lived here then. Before those events it gets very difficult to track. The root family was originally called Yohei, then? That's for sure. They were reputed to be good folk. If someone was in trouble, Yohei of Magino hid him. That reputation has stuck through the years. That's very pretty. Patterns for dying cloth. They're rarely seen nowadays. Pre-war and just after, my family were dyers. Everyone knows Yohei of Magino as the dyers. The successors to your family are still called Yohei? And everyone knows you as dyers of fabric? Can you remember your father as a dyer? I don't remember when my father quit the dyeing. These patterns were handed down through generations? Yes, that's right. Patterns are the only things left from those days. I guess most was lost when we rebuilt the warehouse. No more jars or vats used in the dyeing process? These are all that's left. The 29th day Checking cocoons Very good. You did well. Really? Thank you. Very good for a beginner. I'm pleased you think so. We're ready to remove the cocoons now. Is there anything to consider before we begin? First thing you have to do after taking the racks down... is to remove the distressed cocoons. You mean the dead pupae? Yes, they discolor the others. You mean ones like this? Yes. This one also is dead. And this one, here. This one doesn't look it, but I think it's dead. The larva died just after it started the cocoon. The black thing inside is the dead larva. The weak ones die soon after they begin cocooning. This is how we remove distressed cocoons. This thread that the larvae throw before they begin to cocoon is particularly soft. They use it to stabilize themselves, like scaffolding. They look as neat as castle walls. They're really quite good. Removing cocoons They feel very good in the hand. Very soft and warm. Back in the old days, silk was literally worth its weight in gold. Weight for weight it was equivalent to gold. Production was limited which also pushed up the value. It was very precious, it was a treasure. Especially the heavily brocaded items. Silk has a natural beauty. It's mentioned in all the famous old songs. That's right. When I went away to a hot spring resort, I saw one of those gimcrack souvenir cocoons. It was cut in a zigzag away from the center. Inside it had pieces of yellow and red cloth. Two cocoons in one set. They sell well. But there's a shortage of cocoons in the industry. How wasteful to use good cocoons for a trinket. I wanted to shout out how wasteful it was. Really, it was too much. Don't waste cocoons on trinkets! The 30th day (August 18, 1977) I recalled a lullaby sung to me when I was a child. I sing it for my granddaughter when I baby-sit. I don't sing very well. Don't cry, little baby shed no more tears Where has Hama's mother gone? She went to the river to wash the clothes. But the waters ran fierce and fast Mother, taken by the water, where is she now? She sits on a lotus leaf in heaven Once again It's very simple, but I love that song. I sing it to her before she goes to bed. Today we are at Satoko's ancestral home. It's in the mountains about 4km from Magino. We have Satoko's mother and Satoko, who is carrying her granddaughter, Eri, on her back. So Eri is Satoko's mother's great granddaughter. Satoko is my teacher of sericulture. Satoko's mother originally taught Satoko. Therefore, I'm her "grand-student", as it were. Thank you for joining us. You're very welcome. We have an old saying... Three daughters and you'll have no ashes in the hearth. In order to remove the thread from the cocoons, we used to boil them in water and ashes. Then we'd spin and weave silk by ourselves. I did that, too. I boiled up water and ashes in a kettle. I'd skim the ash which would soften the silk. So three daughters would use up a lot of ash. Hence the old saying about daughters and ashes. Three girls would easily use up a full hearth of ashes. Is Satoko your first daughter? She's my second. You have four daughters in all? Four daughters and one son. The youngest one is your son? All up, I had five. One boy and four giris. I actually have four daughters, not three. The old folk always used the adage about the ashes. But I'm very happy that I had four daughters. Both larva and child, oh, how will you grow? Fattened on mulberry sweet from the field below If you find in me favor, please heed my plea build us a mansion so fine in place of this ruin The End People who joined this project Fuchiko Shitsuyama Natsue Kimura Mine Kimura Riwo Suzuki Mulberry farmers we're indebted to Yuzuo Kimura Nobuo Yamada People who gave tools Yuzuo Kimura Kimura Kuroda Nobuo Yamada People who worked hard for this film Shuichi and Sato (Satoko) Kimura We thank you most sincerely.
