All right. Let's go black in the house. 30 seconds to show time, 30 seconds until show. So we're walking out and we're going to just talk, like, hey, everyone! Yay! Now, to begin the show-- If I wave, they're going to be like, ah! I'm nervous. Guys, let's go. Show time. There's no rulebook about taking YouTubers and putting them on the road. I didn't realize I could go on tour. This way? I make videos on the internet, so, I mean, coming on tour is like above and beyond. Hey, can we slow down? There's never been a YouTube group like us that's done this, so it's scary. 02L! 02L! 02L! - Ricky, get up! - Hi. Good morning. It was actually unlocked, so you didn't even have to knock. Our address is a little bit leaked, so people do come, and like leave presents, and stuff. Sometimes, they'll come and bring cookies. Yeah. We've gotten pizzas ordered to our door, from them ordering it. Sometimes, we keep the pizzas because they're good. I drove up one time and this girl and her mom were waiting in their car in our driveway. She gave me cookies. Oh, thanks. How did you know where I lived? What's up, guys? It's 02L! They're not musicians. They vlog, each and every week, on a lot of pop culture and lifestyle content. Each guy takes of day of the week and they build programming around themes. Hey, what's up, 02L? It's Connor. And this week, on 02L, we were a little confused on what we should do, so we decided fan week! School week! Gaming week! Pop culture week! Each of the six guys takes a day to create a video around that theme. It's a group. It's very simple. We all, individually, made our own videos for like a year or two, separately. We were all across the country. And we met through YouTube and became friends. And then we met up in person, after being friends for like over a year. And then we were like, hey, let's join forces. So we did. I want to try and film videos because they need to film at least six before we go on tour, so I can have them up and ready before-- because I know we're not going to have Wi-Fi everywhere we go and I know we're not going to have space to film everywhere we go, so I want to get them done. And I know Ricky does, too. Hey, guys! What's up? It's Ricky and Kian. Tada! I'm eating pizza. And I am so sorry this is up late. I upload on Sundays, my main channel. And then on 02L, there's a channel we share together, I upload on Tuesday. So today's Tuesday. And then I just upload it and I add annotations on the video. I try to upload like around noon because that's the best time in relation to the whole world, like the UK is still awake-- it's like 6:00 o'clock there, I think-- then people here are getting out of school soon. So it's a good time. So it's like, literally, an ongoing job. It's kind of like a TV show. Like if the video is up late, the video won't do as well as usual. So-- so I try to stick to a strict schedule, but it's still awesome. No one can like tell me what to do. Because of my YouTube, you get-- you get direct feedback. You know, you get comments, you get tweets, and stuff. I usually just read like the top 10 and then I'll check the next day or something. That's good. You learn from it, depending upon what the comment is about. Like, I mean, if it's someone just saying you're ugly, you just like laugh and roll your eyes because it's just them being dumb. But if it's someone being like, I don't like this video because of this reason, then I actually kind of take it like as good-- you know, constructive criticism. And maybe I'll try and work on that for next time. Hey, what's up, O2L? It's Connor. And oh my god, you will not guess what I just did. Two years ago, I would never have guessed that we would just upload a video and then be seen by hundreds of thousands of people. Hey, guys. We're going to react to 1 million subscribers. Hey, guys, it's 02L. And we are reacting to 1 million. It's weird, especially because it's people all across the world that I've never met and they've found me on just the internet. It seems like a weird concept, to me, that you can be so interactive with all these people you've never met and they do feel such a personal connection to you. Come on. I feel like to be as real person on YouTube, I need to let them know in on my life as much as I can. Obviously, there's going to be some stuff I need to keep private, but the more I put out into the world and the more feedback I get, is the more of a connection I feel with them. We all had our own problems in life before we were really big on YouTube. And like we all kind of leaned to YouTube to make us happy and make us forget about those problems. We were able to express ourselves-- Without feeling judged. It was just like talking to a therapist. I would-- instead of talking to a person, I would talk to a camera. Yeah. And here we are. There's a kid advertising on my channel. Get off here. Another kid advertising. Where are my shoes? And not the ones you threw in the pool? Uh-- we have our second tour rehearsal today, so we're like getting prepared. I think it will all come together. Ricky's almost ready. Are you guys ready? He's always the last one. Hey, I heard that! Kian hogged the shower. It's not my fault. He's always the one who's late. He's the grumpiest. Hold on, if we-- were going to be late because Ricky has to Instagram. They're asking for my video. He's grumpy. I'm not grumpy. - He's always grump. - You're the one who's grump. I'm not always grumpy. Ricky, I'm smiling. You're grumpy. I'm fine. No. Oh, man, rehearsal's going to be great. This is called, "Ordinary." I released it two weeks ago. It's my first, original single. I'll play it for you. Oh my god. I've only done two covers. And they both did really well, so I was like, hey, I'm going to make an original. I just need to work on my dances. Too much? Are we walking? You guys looked so amazing. That was horrible. I don't give a what? It's obvious! Seriously, the more you do like you're actually doing it on stage, the better it's going to be on stage. You don't want to look like amateurs. Um-- I think that we all had to scratch our heads, initially, because we were sort of unsure. So we watched videos and sort of found the moments that were the most popular, but I think, at the end of the day, they're entertainers, so we thought of something that felt like a variety show. They're doing live challenges, they're dancing, they're singing, they're talking to the audience, they-- they're bringing fans on stage. - Wait. So we dancing then-- Dancing, dress up, and then-- And then for the finale, are we still doing-- we're doing our song? You tell me. I think we'll do the song. For now, it needs fireworks. I'm telling you. And then we come out with banana suits. That would be so fun. Let's go banana! Actually, that's a really good idea. - Yeah! - Yes. Can-- can it be rippable off? That's when the balloons or whatever-- Then we should have run in with a gorilla suit and tackle us all, bring us off stage. Bye, guys! We should have a guy in a gorilla suit. That'd be cool. - Perfect. - Ready? Let's go! Hi, everyone. Wait! Hold up! Are we missing someone? Trevor! Where's Trevor? Trevor! - Ricky, I told you to get him. - No, no. I told you to get Trevor. - I told Ricky to wake him up. - I told you. - I never listen. - I told Kian to get him. - Sam, can you get Trevor? - Yes. I think he's on the tour bus or something. Ah, he's asleep still. - I bet he's not-- is he asleep? - Wait. Do you know what you're doing? No, we have no idea, guys. We have no idea. - Trevor, block your eyes. - I know. That's what I've been doing. I thought you guys were talking-- Guys, just talk Let's just do it all again. All right? I think, the first few shows, my dance might be a little off, but, I think, as we go, obviously, I'll get better with it. I'm only a nervous about like my song because this will be my third time singing live. I've just-- I've always wanted to try it, so my music manager, Gene, you got me in contact with Nicholas Cooper. He taught Beyonce, Katy Perry, and JLo. Those are the only ones I know about. Uh, uh. Listen. OK. Now I really want you to try to connect with the breath. Take the breadth first. Take a breath in through your nose. So it's not like a-- It's just a more-- - Yeah. Try it. - OK. Place the water in your mouth. Don't swallow. Make the water tight. Make the water really tight in your mouth. You're making it tight? Liar. You're not making it tight. What do you mean by tight? Exactly. So we'll do this one. Let's do the ne-nah-na-nu-nu, just to warm it up. Two, three, and go-- Ne-nah-na-no-nu! Keep doing it. And-- - Ne-nah-na-nu-nu! - Uh, uh. Don't over try. Don't over sing. - OK. - Just talk to me. Say, ne-nah-na-nu-nu. Ne-nah-na-nu-nu. Ne-nah-na-nu-nu Ne-nah-na-nu-nu. All the personality-- ne-nah-na-nu-nu. Ne-nah-na-nu-nu. What's the name of the song you wanted to work on today? "Ordinary." Two, three, and go. Chilling on the West Side, playing my song, got the Kia Soul with my cheap shades on. Going to run-- Going to run right through. I have to commend Ricky, you know, for coming in because he came in with-- under the premise of wanting to take his artistry to the next level. He came in saying, look, I have a cool following, but I know that where I am, isn't where I should be. And it's clearly not where I want to go. Please, pick up your mail out front because you have too much. He didn't take for granted that, man, people know me. Could you hold this door real quick, someone? Thank you so much. I appreciate it. You're welcome. All right. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. - You good? - Yeah. Thank you. - All right. Well, I guess I got a lot. I think. My PO box is on my videos, and my Twitter, and stuff. And um-- my viewers just send in like cool drawings, they send in letters, candy, like little present. And then what I do is I make a video where I open up a lot of the stuff and like just react to it on camera. It's pretty simple, but they like it. It's fun. Woo! OK. Wow! We got some glow sticks, which I will, actually, will definitely use. This one looks fun. Actually, I'm going to open this one. It's from Summer. She lives in Texas. Girl, I will be coming to your state in like four days. Let's hang out. She sent me some tennis balls, which I play tennis, so you must know me really well. I got a-- what is this? Yes! I got a ferry outfit! You know what? This will actually help me out in future videos, when I play other characters, like a princess. Make more noise. Is that good? - Yeah. - Or should it be-- No, it looks good. A little darker. Go that way. Get out. What's up, guys? It's Kian. And today, I'm joined with Ricky frickin' Dillon and Jc-- Swiffer to the rescue! Swiffer to the rescue. Oh my god! Was that pee? Yeah. No, it's not. - Hey. OK. So yeah. I'm with Ricky. We are playing a little game called, Most Likely To. And the game-- and how the game works is there's a bunch of questions. And it says, most likely to clean up dog poop with a Swiffer broom. But the game is only between me and Ricky, as you can tell by our signs. Who's more likely to cry in public? Me. How me? Well, I've never done it before. How am I-- no. I feel like you would cry more in public. Open bus tours. Where's Trevor's Moran's house? - Stop. Of course, I want to make music in Hollywood and stuff, but living here-- I-- I'm fine where I live right now. I don't want my whole life to flip upside down. So that means you'll never move out? Maybe. I have you forever? Yup. That's really cool. - You like that? - That's awesome. Did you write that yourself? - Yes. That's awesome. Congratulations, man. The music sounds really good. I can't believe you've only been doing this how now? About a year. That's crazy. The whole recording thing. Wow. Have you feel like you've grown a lot in that year, from the first time you ever stepped in the studio? I have! I hope there's more space to improve. Yeah. I think there definitely is. Where are you-- where were you recording most of this stuff, right now? - Um-- - In his bedroom. - It's really good. Thank you. There's no denying the talent there. And I've always kind of been the voice for discovering new music and showcasing them with my-- with my new music show on-- on KIIS. And, you know, I was one of the first people that Scooter called when he found Bieber, but he didn't have any original music, he wasn't writing things like that. Like that took him a while. Like you're ahead of where he was. Oh, gosh. Which is kind of crazy and scary. Like I don't want tell you, like you know? But-- but you want to get things out there, so people can see, and witness that growth, and be a part of that. Question-- what do you think would be the first single? Oh. Whoa! This is looking good. You know that you've got a voice, in a good way. I like that. I used to sound like a Kid's Bob artist, so at least it's not-- You're basically doing all of 02L's song because you're like-- you hit the high notes and shit. And it's, basically, all the parts. - Do a mic check. - I want to sing. Yeah, but you can't hit the high notes. Do they have the entire-- We're going to have an hour and 15 minutes? Yeah. Do they have the entire dance? I mean, do you have more to teach them? Oh! I want you to hear the drop. The drop is cool in this song. When did you hear it? - He sent it to me. - I sent to him. We're music buds. Why did you do that? Because he always sends me previews of his songs. All right, guys. Stand up on the stage, please. I don't give a what? So are you listening? Really? Check yourself, before you wreck yourself because you guys are fucking slobs. - OK. So the opening-- You're rocking with the whole damn-- Can you show me where you're standing? From the top. - OK. When the beat drops. Everybody, go bananas! One, two-- Doo, doo, doo, doo-- Five, six, seven, eight. And one-- - Oh, shit. Three, four. Together, five, six-- Kick that toddler, kick that baby! Uh, uh, uh! Huh, huh! Bu, bu, bu, bu! Rob, you did a great job. Thank you, Rob! Um-- my expectations we're here. Thanks for having lots of for us! Yeah. I set the bar really low, so that I'm constantly impressed and surprised. No, I think you did an amazing job. And I think the girls-- I was telling, Andrew, I think some girls in the audience are probably going to go through puberty watching this. Oh my god. Meredith! Let's get a tour chant. Here we go! 02L! - Wait, wait, wait. - Tour. Tour! Tour! Tour! Tour! Tour! Tour! Tour! Three years ago, I was at a mall and two girls came up to me. That's like the first time someone's ever asked me for a picture. And I was like, why do you want picture? They were like, oh, yeah, we like really love your videos. I'm like, oh. Oh, OK. Then I'll keep making them. Looking back, it was really, really quick. All of this happened in a couple of years. We just made videos and then, all of a sudden, bam! It's here. - It's so insane. It from like hundreds, to a couple hundred, to a thousand, to a couple thousand. Hopefully, it just keeps growing. Thank you. I appreciate it. Fans are really excited to see us. It's becoming more of a thing. And I mean, I suppose with 2.5 million subscribed to my channel, I suppose it's going to happen, but it's still a little bit of a shock. Basically, how you really-- you do it is like you look up a flight from where they're leaving from, and then you just-- process of elimination. - Yeah. And then if they Tweet that they're on the plane, then we, obviously, know that they're on it, they're coming. Who Tweeted the photo? I think it was Sam or Trevor. One of them posted like the airplane wing and then yeah. So-- Oh, there's Connor. It's Connor. - Wait! Connor! Oh my-- What am I going to say? Well, we were driving to the venue and we saw the tour bus. And we decided we'd follow the tour bus. And that ended up happening. We got here at like 9:00-ish. And we've just been waiting 'cause we just like-- even for them to come by and wave at us or smile at us would, pretty much, make somebody's entire life. Can I get a photo with you? Hi! Um-- I was like, mom, OK, I'm leaving. We'll be sitting out there for, probably, 12 hours. She's like, why? They're not a band, they're just guys. It's muggy, though, you're right. She calls them my fictitious world because I don't actually know them. But it's something you can't explain-- the relationship. Thanks, Ricky. You're welcome. You don't know them, but you feel like you do. You feel like you're friends with them. Good! Trevor, tighter in. There you go. Don't fidget! I messed up. You guys are fooling around too much. That's what they want to see. So you have to understand that you guys have plenty of time to fool around. When it's time to do the choreography, you need to do it. - Cool. Now let's talk about the things that we have to decide for the improv. Can we talk about that? No. So we're not scrambling backstage. Can we flop around? All of us come out. That way, they can be, ah! They get their screaming-- they get their screams out. They can still get their initial screaming out of like seeing us for the first time. We calm them down. Then we can to stand up and they can actually hear us. I'm a booking agent. The company represents artists like Macklemore, and The Black Keys, and Paramore, Guns N' Roses, Nickelback, et cetera. And what we did is we took an approach similar to booking rock bands for these artists. And it works in a live setting. Everybody wants to see-- Celebrities. They're celebrities in YouTube land, but, nonetheless, they're still celebrities. The VIP meet and greet sold out in 20 minutes because they want to meet them. I love you! Will give you me a kiss on the cheek? Yes. For you, I will. Will you take a selfie? - Yeah. - Picture? Yeah. How many friends do you have here? - Two. - 02L! 02L! 02L! Seeing their faces other than a computer screen is what I came here for. And to see people that made me happy again. I'm going to shake. I want to cry. They're my life. Oh my god! Oh my god! This is it, ladies and gentlemen. The boys of 02L! So many phones were thrown onstage. - Why do they do that? - I know! During my song, they threw two to me. I was like, I'm trying to sing, please, don't! I dodged-- I dodged one. I would never throw my phone. That's crazy. And that girl-- she threw her shoe. I took one girl's phone and I put it on the speaker. And it was like the perfect view. And I think she-- she got a video of the whole dance. And then at the end-- at the end, I gave it back to her. Oh, there's some candy out there, if you guys want it. Thank you, Blake. Yeah, guess. First show. Success. Hella fun. Yay! We made it, guys! When things settle down, can I go outside and meet fans? Uh-- for a limited amount of time because I don't want you to get caught in that flood. Ricky! We have never had this before. We didn't know who they were and then we sold out the same day it went on sale. They're really big. I mean, I understand where they're coming from. I was their age once. They were lining up at 6:00 o'clock this morning, waiting for them. - Connor! Connor! Connor! Wait! Ricky! Ricky! - We love you! - Ricky! How many did you meet? Did you meet with a bunch? I met like all down this line, a little bit of that one, and went all the other line, and then it just got too crazy. That's why I went inside. It's hot out there. Florida's hot. - Yeah. Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam! Sam, you're the only one that didn't go out yet. No! No! No, that's mean. It's your turn. Ricky just did. I'm not in the mood to get trampled or them get trampled. Sam! Sam! Oh my god! They come up to you, and they hug you, and they like say they love you, and stuff like that. But you have no idea who they are, but they know you so well because vlogging is such like a personal thing. It's a really weird, new thing that we're experiencing. I don't think anyone gets it yet or will get for a while. 02L has remarkable momentum right now. The secret sauce for 02L is really simple-- they engage well. That's what they do, right? TV stars-- you have to act good. Like radio stars-- you have to sound good. Like this generation-- you have to engage well. It's kind of chilly. Should we get food to go? - And then a medium-- - Hello? Sorry. It's my mom. She says, hi. I'm looking-- I'm looking forward to meeting you. Did you hear that? Yeah. It was awesome. It was so much fun. You-- since you're my family, you can get in, for free, backstage and meet me. I sent a bunch of Snapchats to people being like, hey, ready for a room tour? Just-- just um-- call me when you get there. I'll come get you. It's just like my face in the dark. I don't know. What state are we in? - I don't know. We've been driving too long. - OK. I probably will. I don't know the times anymore. Love you, too. Bye. People were asking like, oh, do we have any big influences that are in college? I hated college. I actually love your story of like trying to intern. So, literally, my plan was to use that as an excuse to come here. And then, hopefully, I'd get big enough to stay in and work. It's very tactical. Well do. - Do you miss-- - No. Do you want to go back home? Or you love LA? I love LA. I was very lonely and sad, in Alabama, to be honest. Oh. My videos-- when I first started making them, I was in high school. At the beginning, you know, I had no viewers. It wasn't like respected. People were confused at what I was doing and they didn't really get it. So I was made fun of a lot. Like people played my videos at school, and like made fun of me, and stuff. It was really bad. I'm in an elevator, singing a song. Song, song, song. - Can I-- can I go now? Yeah. I'm not going to like try to sugarcoat it. It was really bad. I was upset for like a month. I was made fun of in the halls, in class, at lunch, on Facebook. OK. We have a problem, Mag. They can't see our legs! He made a music video to "Move Along" by All American Rejects. And he was so proud of it. So he came to school and he was like, watch this video that I made, like to everyone that would listen. And it got around the school to the point where teachers were playing it on the big projectors in class, like when they weren't doing anything. So everyone in the school saw it. And it was awful. He didn't even want to get out of his car in the morning. And he said that he wanted to quit, at one point. He has such a big personality to be living in Alabama. And he's meant to be out in California. And he knew that from the start. And videos were his way to be that big personality that he couldn't be at school. He stuck with it. I'm so proud of him. Hey, I have a question. One of my guests wants to know if they can have a picture with y'all? Oh, yeah. Totally. She's a really big fan. Oh! What's up? I'm the mother. Aw! Hi, mom. Did you get it? - Yes. Cool. Nice to meet you. Thank you so much. You're welcome. I like your shirt. You made her day. Thank you very much. Nice to meet you. There should be something right over here. - He'll find us. - Yeah. There he goes. OK. Who's Capulet's niece? - Juliet. - OK. What about-- - Is it? - OK. Is it Juliet? No. It's um-- Look. Ro-- the flob. Rosaline. Mm hm. I think it's going to be D. OK. This is crazy. I never thought we would be here. I woke up and I didn't know what day it was. I didn't even know what city I'm in. So it's like-- I think it's almost 2:00 o'clock, but I just woke up. We're getting ready. Trevor is here, in the room, away from all the other kids, because Trevor is doing finals. Trevor's 15. A couple of the boys are 21. The others are 18. So he's the youngest. And I'm not just going to let him go on the road by himself. I know he'd probably be OK for a couple of days and I've done that before, but for a month, a long tour, I want to be there. He will get off track. He'll eat candy for breakfast and he won't sleep. And then they'll get sick, and then he won't sound good on stage, and that's the most important thing-- that he wants to sound good-- really good-- onstage for everybody. And so I'm just here to make sure that all his hard work-- that he keeps a line, does good. - All right. Well, while I'm taking my exams, there's probably plenty of things the boys are doing. They're probably-- Thank you. Ricky! Oh my god! Oh my god! I'm shaking! I'll get all of you to work! You're so cute and tall! Oh my god! - Wait! She's taking a picture! Hi. Hey, girls, can we step back just a little bit? Like right here. Let's start a line right here because it's starting to turn into like a-- a jungle in here. Oh, wait! Can I write my Twitter on your arm, by any chance? Do you have your Sharpie? Yup. Can I put my Twitter name on you? Yeah. Can you follow me on Twitter? - What's your Twitter? - CashMoneyDown. Oh, that's hard. - Can you follow us on Tweeter? - Yeah. Am I signing these as well? - Yes. Yes. They wrote all over my tattoo. Twitters, Twitter, and another Twitter. I'll probably follow this one, I can see this one. I can't see these. That looks like gibberish. And then I can read this one. I don't really care if I get followed from someone big. It's cool, but I don't really care, so I don't know how they feel. It's like amazing like to get followed because like they see your tweets on their timeline. It's like getting their autograph, but electronically. So they all try to get it. I have like tried to spam them to get me-- to get them to follow me. Like here's one of them. I reached up to the number 347 to see if they could just like notice me. That's it. This is a book of full page letters from people on Twitter-- like just on, and on, and on. How does that make you feel? It's crazy because like you see how much time they put into this. They put each paper in a little plastic thing to keep it all nice and neat. - Wow. Yeah. It's crazy. Hi, Sam. Oh, hi. Can I get you to sign this really fast? Yeah. Let's get back over here. Thank you so much! You're welcome! Good luck. - Thank you. Nice to meet you! - You, too. I've got to go. We have to do sound check. - See you at the show! - Bye, guys! I love you! FAN We love you! We love you! Hello. I don't even get it. I mean, to this day, my friends even tell me, what does he do? I have no-- he does YouTube. That's all I know. I have no clue. The way I look at it is I just want him to be happy. If he's happy, I'm happy, you know? And that's all I care about right now. 02L! Don't push! Don't throw your phones on stage, all right? Just have fun and be safe, OK? Hold up, hold up, hold up! We're missing somebody. Who are we missing? - I told you to get him. - OK. I texted Ricky. - I told you to get Trevor. Uh-- I told Kian. No! I think he's here. Go get him. Trevor! Trevor! Trevor! Trevor! Trevor! We need to figure out why Trevor is late. What-- Jc, what's one reason why Trevor's late? He was walking down the stairs, he slips on a banana, he breaks his leg. And that's it. - Kian? Kian, what's the other reason. So something happened to Kian today. We were driving to the venue and a watermelon fell on his head. And he can't talk English. He speaks this really weird language. But I can translate for him. Kian, tell them how your day's been. Who cares if they sit on stage, on a stool, and eat yogurt? It's clearly entertaining their fans. You know, the people who that might be naysayers, like of this sort of format, I would say, just look at the numbers. We sold the whole thing out before we even announced a single guest artist. Adults don't necessarily understand it, but did adults understand MTV, back in the '80s? I mean, this is the cultural movement right now. I'll get him. Sam, did you find him? OK. Honestly, those boys can just stand up on stage, and do nothing, and they'd be fine. They can't even do half of the stuff because the girls are screaming and screaming. And they won't even stop to listen to the boys. Let me get a selfie. We came to see them be them. Nope. That's what we want them to do. Just hang out, like normal people. You guys are incredible! Talk to us, you know, just like everyone else. One, two, three! Wait, wait. 02L! 02L! - Have you got those two? - Yeah. I got these. You got those? All right. - Bye, bye! - Wait. Where are you going? I want you to go back in the bus. 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! Keep moving! Keep moving! Do not stop here! Get off the street! You are still standing on pavement! You are still on pavement! Tre, Tre, Tre! I got stuff for you. I'm leaving. Can I have a kiss? - You're leaving? - I am. - Wait. Are you coming-- - I'm going. I'll see you in Houston. I'm going to spend the night with Kenny and I'll ride in with Chris and Meredith. Trevor! Trevor! Trevor! Trevor! OK. So you're not going to leave this bus then, right? No. Do you promise me you're going to get to, you know, sleep early and not stay up all night? Yeah. Go! Go! Go! What are you doing? Off the stage! Now that I have your attention, please, back up! Yes. Please, like four feet! Like four-- you know, just like human. Go back, please. Over here. Over here. Yeah. That's you-- you guys. Right here. I'm looking right at you. Eye contact. Back up. The cop was just like-- I heard-- I heard cops. Oh, this venue is pissed at us. OK. How many people do we have? The rule of thumb is like you guys are going to go out, and like let's talk to security guards, and make sure you're safe, and your fans. It's not about you, It's about them because people get hurt out there, right? They're not staffed enough. They don't have enough police officers. And people get injured. It's not about limiting your time your friends, it's about keeping your fans safe. Yeah. Guys, the police want us out. We got to go, wheels up. They're not going to follow us for more than five minutes. We had people follow us for 40 minutes last time. Do you hear that? That sounds like screaming fans. That's scary. Is there people following us? I don't know. It's freaking me out. That is screaming fans! - That was the worst! OK. That one was the worst. Oh my god! - Oh, no! - Yikes! It's probably one of the best experiences, like being on a tour bus with your best friends and pretty much brothers-- like family members you know. I think it's a good thing that we were on this bus for so long and not flying. It's definitely bringing us closer together. Oh, Birmingham? It would be cool to go back to where I grew up and like perform. My parents will be there. OK. A video. Are you guys better than Atlanta? - Yes! - Yes! Of course, we are! Oh my god! Yes! OK. On the count of three, say, no, Birmingham is better than Atlanta! - All right. - OK. - OK. - One, two-- - No! Birmingham is better than Atlanta! - Look, you guys are on a video. - I want to see! Is that going to be on YouTube? Can I record this? Can I record this? Is it on your channel? Oh my gosh! Yeah. Ready? Go. - I want one! - Thank you. You're welcome. Ready? - Yeah. There we go. Thank you! Spread it! Post it! Share it! Nice meeting you guys. Oh, I like your shirt, too. Bye, Kian! That was the greatest thing ever. That was fun. Now have you been told to lay low? Yes. After the show is a big no, no. This is when I want to film because there's not too many people, but after the show, it's going to be like 1,500. It's kind of like everyone moves in a line like perfectly and slowly, usually. But lately, it's been like everyone's trying to get to the front, everyone's trying to meet you, everyone is trying to tell, everyone is trying to-- it's like static. Fans find you. Fans find you everywhere. Fans find you at venues. And as you can see, probably, behind me, fans even find you when you're not at venues, right? So it's about moving the guys around fans. Look at them! They're so silly! All right. Get Ricky with me in it. Got it. We'll go to the left here. Richard? Is he hiding from us? No, he's on stage? Isn't he on stage? Oh, oh, oh. So we can go out here? Yeah. I - Hi! - Hey! There he is. - I was doing sound check. - I know. I like your shirt. This is-- this is really incredible. Oh, thanks. So amazing. Are you going to sing for sound check? Yeah. Is that what you do? I'm just rehearsing. Chilling on the West Side, playing my song, drive the Kia Soul with my cheap shades on. Going run right through the night! I don't give a what! I don't give a what! Come on! Shelby! Shelby! You want me to dance with you? - I like your shirt a lot. - Sam! Come dance with me! Rick Dillon! Come on, Sam! Broken hearts, and Styrofoam, and empty double cups-- I guess I'm ordinary because I don't give a what! Woo! - Your biggest fans! - That was good. It was all right, but-- One thing that I'm so proud of him for is that, you know, his good Christian values-- when you watch his videos and you listen to him talk, it's acceptable. Well, I think I've ranted enough in this video, but I want to end it with a more positive note and a good moral statement. He was a good kid. Ricky was always very kind and thoughtful. Where did you make that outfit? Do you like it? I like baking. Can I have? He didn't worry about trying to be popular or trying to be cool. Hello? Yes, you're on the broadcast. He was just creative. Hm. Did you see that Pokemon battle? Even when he was little, he was carrying that big, old camcorder and filming people. And he's always wanted to do it. He's putting shows on and always entertaining. Hi, Ricky! Sometimes, those are the ones that are picked on-- the ones that are more free spirits, and kinder, that are trying to be the tough, macho guy, or the great athlete. The wonderful thing is-- those kind of people, usually, when they are picked on, once you get into college and move on, that's when society realizes that those are, really, the good people that have so much to offer. Can I get a picture with you? Oh, sure! You'll be my first! - OK. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey, Oscar. Yeah? Do you do this all the time? This is my first one. - How do you like it? - Insane. 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! I don't like sitting at the end anymore. Fuck this. I want to be where Ricky is. Ricky's getting all of them, man. You're welcome. FAN Don't be nervous! Oh, this is cool! Thanks so much! FAN Can I get a photo? - Yeah. Don't cry! You do not want to cry in your photo! That will be really bad! My hand was shaking! And I don't want it to shake! She watches him every single. And it's just like they're actually real people. And it's not OK! They make us so happy. They've like gone through a lot. And like it's just amazing how like-- They make us like look at the positive stuff in life. It's just amazing. I can't look at them in the eye. I don't believe it. Like I don't believe this is true. Like I feel like it's a dream and I'm just going to like wake up in an hour. I feel like they're my family. It's like we've been with them for so long that it's-- We'll be waiting for the names of their kids. Yes. I can't, I can't, I can't. I can't do it. No, you're fine. Do you want me to take it? - Yeah. - Thank you so much. - Hi! Hi. Nice to meet you. Do you want me to take it? My hair is messed up a little. OK. Nice to meet you. I hope you have fun. Hello. Oh my god. Hi. Nice to meet you. I feel like I'm going to faint right now. Don't. Do you want some water? Do you want water? This was my old water. I just got Kain's old water! Oh my god! His old water! No! I'm going to drink his saliva! They're real. I don't know what to say. Like I can't believe they're actual people. I hugged-- - I touched their faces! I can't-- I want to do it again. Wait, are people going to see us talking about this? Yes? Usually, you'll have a line for like half an hour, but we've been having lines of multiple people selling for like an hour to an hour and a half. So like we're doing three times as much as you would on a normal tour. People will buy all the shirts. I mean, it's almost rare that people buy just one. We started out with like about 10 designs and now we're just down to one design. It's what you want to do for your daughters. Yes. I drove three hours for this. I drove 5 and 1/2 hours and flew my daughter's best friend in, so they could come up here and meet 02L because that's what she wanted for her birthday. And I love my daughter. She's obsessed. It reminds me of like how my mother was over the Beatles-- like screaming, and shouting, and I'm going to faint. I would compare their reaction to the same as when I saw Van Halen-- the screaming, and just all excited, and you can't talk, and your-- you have tears in your eyes. Like New Kids on the Block. It's that big. They know, every time, they put a post, a Tweet. They're following them, like we used to follow them, but we didn't have the internet to do it. No. We were Leonard Skinner. Aerosmith. We've had a Rolling Stones concert. Yeah. Yeah. But we didn't go crazy like this. You know, these kids-- I mean, they cry and everything. We didn't cry over Mick. No, no. This is not a new formula. Backstreet Boys-- cute guys. N'Sync-- cute guys. The Beatles-- cute guys. Right? While the sort of format and the exploit is not traditional to an older generation, to the current generation, it is the status quo. It's cool. I love it. It's weird because like I don't think-- besides Shelby, I haven't seen like any of this kind of stuff before, so it's pretty cool. 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L, 02L. I guess I have to learn the chants, so I can be out there, yelling at Ricky. All right. Give me a hug, guys. This is my last until New York. You guys have been so awesome. Congrats on selling out an amazing ass tour. Thank you guys so much! Hey! Here it is. Chilling on the West Side, playing my song, drive my Kia Soul with my cheap shades on! Going to run right through the night! Jump off the gate, fall to the ground. It don't matter, still hitting this town! Oh, it never felt so right! So now we're running around the boulevard! I couldn't know, I couldn't ask for me! So sick and tired of staying up to see the break of dawn. Everybody's taking shots until they're passed out on the lawn! Broken hearts and styrofoam-- And empty double cups. I guess I'm ordinary because I don't give a what! I don't give a what! So sick and tired of staying up to see the break of dawn! Everybody's taking shots until they're passed out on the lawn. Broken hearts and Styrofoam and empty double cups. I guess I'm ordinary because I don't give a what! Thank you guys so much! I love you guys so much! Give it up for Ricky Dillon! - So much fun! - Hi. Did you like it? It's so great watching them sing and they know the words. I know. It's weird. - And they just-- - How'd I do? We had a really good time out there. Thank you. Thank you. Is mom outside? She's sitting up-- way up there. She's stuck in the middle of our-- Hi. Show them your room. OK. Well, above my bed, you can see an 02L poster that we got 100 days before the June 3rd tour, which is tomorrow. This is the Pikachu that Ricky gave-- well, actually, I gave Ricky. So I have the exact same one. And you can see it in some of his videos. And I get really excited whenever that happens. And um-- this is a "Local Wolves" magazine that I got with Jc on the cover. Last June, Jc did a meet up in Atlanta, at Piedmont Park. And so we waited in line with all these girls. And I kept asking all the girls in line, like, what is it about 02L? What-- what is so special about them? And every girl I asked said, they're so inspirational. And her dad and I looked at each other and we were like, we don't get it. What? What is the deal? So like that next week, I stayed up until like 3:00 o'clock in the morning watching videos and I got it. I think they're inspirational to girls because most teen boys don't know how to talk to girls. And when you watch one of the boys' videos, it's like they're speaking directly to you. And it makes the girls feel important, it makes them feel loved. Like you could be having a really bad day, and you could click on one of their videos, and like you'd be smiling again. No matter how you were feeling, they would always make you feel good about yourself. A girl was bullying my daughter and she watched-- I think it was Jc's video about bullying. And it's OK, that you'll get through it, that, you know, those people are who they are for reasons, and it made her feel better. They once had an entire week dedicated to that. And like they said-- they were telling their stories of how like they got bullied. And they said, well, I never gave up, so why would you want to give up? Just be you and it's OK. Ricky got bullied in high school, I got bullied in high school. I think all of us could relate that way. And I think that helped him out a lot-- that whole thing, that whole week. I started to feel real insecure about myself-- what I wore, how I look. It all of a sudden mattered to me. It all took a toll on me. And even I started questioning myself. I was lost. We continue to make these videos because we get messages like that every day like, you know, your video helped me out through this time. Or I watched this video and that day, I was like so depressed and then it just made me feel just a little bit better. And you know, like that little bit better is sometimes like all it needs to keep going. I just want to say thank you for everything you've done for me because I really wouldn't be standing here today, if it wasn't for you. Oh, thank you so much. We've all gone through the same stuff-- like going through depression stuff when I was younger and also like having problems with my parents. Hey, guys! What's up? It's Sam and you are watching Our Second Life. This week is going to be a little different. It's an anti-bullying week. I pretty much told them like how I dealt with it, and like what the best way is, and like what you shouldn't do because some things I did wasn't the best. We're going to help each other out, you know? Thank you! No problem. We're all trying to just make it better. It's scary to most people because that's like a lot of pressure. Like I watch you, I go to you when I'm depressed, I go to you when I'm feeling this way. It might be scary to some people, but, for me, I feel like-- I'm happy. I'm happy that they come to me. Is it something you can relate to? For bullying, yeah. All right. So for this next part, we have six fans from the audience already picked out. When I tell you guys to come on, you guys are going to come on the stage. Yes. - OK. They're going to come out, get their box of props, and dress their 02L boy. Whoever can make the prettiest girl wins! Bring out the contestants! Are you guys ready? I think he's ready. OK. So we're going to put 60 seconds on the clock. Make some noise, Houston! Show them some love! Who's ready to impress 02L! Signature time. Real big. Here we go. This is for our Second Life. That blue car behind me-- they have followed us now for, approximately, 20 miles. They have been cutting us off, coming in between us, just wanting to see a glimpse of the boys. Some will ride all the way across. Is this a common thing? Yes. I've been with rock bands, country bands, one or two boy bands-- Backstreet Boys, one time. This has been the worst one, here. I've never seen this many teenage girls in my life. It's intense. And I'm watching them because, I mean, they're right behind me. And we've got four or five behind us right now. I almost pushed in my bumper. That little, blue car-- that's the main one. That's the one that's been running all the red lights. You know these last security at these venues-- what's sort of the word that they're saying to you guys after these shows? The biggest word they're saying is crazy. They've never seen anything this bad ever. He's like not on my computer screen. Thank you. Can you make a video saying, hi, Tiana? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yes. - Maybe. I think it's six hours until the next stop and we probably would have gone. I bought a ticket, but the hotel room-- Why is that so hard to believe? We met them. We speeded! We chased-- we went faster than I would like to admit on camera. I'm pretty sure we broke every law possible while traveling here, but it happened. So-- To meet 02L. To meet all the guys. It was totally worth it. They were like such down to earth guys. They stopped. It's like 8:00 o'clock at night right now, and we're at a gas station, and they all are tired, and they still stopped to take pictures. That was great. - Yeah. They're amazing. Why? Because they're like normal guys, filming videos in their room, being stupid, and it's great. They're so relatable. We don't anything else. We just want to talk to them. Yesterday, me, Kian, and Sam got tattoos. What? Let's see them. Oh, this is going to be on the tour doc. We all got the same. We got bro tattoos actually. We were thinking we were going to get a tour bus to resemble the tour, but I don't want to get a tour bus on me. That's fucking lame. So he had like a smiley face written on him with Sharpie. And then he was like, why don't we just get this? We went in and this guy was like-- Huge guy with like tattoos. And we were like, hey, can we get a smiley face? It was so embarrassing. Sam got tally marks. It's six for 02L. And I got it right on my veins because they're blood brothers to me. I was going to get the tour bus. Come outside! Come outside! Come outside! Come outside! Come outside! Come outside! Oh, god! I'm next. Nice to meet you. - How are you? - I'm good. How are you? - I'm good. I saw your-- I saw your 02L video. It's nice. - Oh, thank you. Have fun tonight, OK? That was cool. Did you see that? All right. Thank you so much. Hi, how are you? Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god! Jc kissed me on the cheek! I'm not kidding! What's up, guys? It's Kian. And today, I'm joined with Ricky fricking Dillon and Jc the-- Swiffer to the rescue! Swiffer to the rescue! Oh my-- It's up. I'm going to text Ricky. I didn't think it would be up that quick. It's a funny video. I like it. What do you like about it? I don't know. I try to make videos that like-- where people can get to know me better and connect better, so it feels like it's more of a relationship, not just a YouTube video. Oh my gosh. I cannot describe how happy I am. Thank you. That makes me happy. Thanks for coming. We've been waiting for this for so long. It was great meeting you. You, too. One more hug. It was nice meeting you. Thanks for coming. So your friends in the VIP. Because I have three VIP tickets, but you guys are all friends, right? I know. I tried getting it. And as soon as I bought it, like it went-- - It was sold out. - It was sold out. I was like, what? - Are you going to stay here? - Yeah. Stay on this side of the building. - Yes. - OK. - I can probably get five. - OK. - I can just get two more. - OK. - Thank you. - You're the sweetest. He is so sweet! He is so nice! Thank you! Most famous people, they're like, oh, no, the fans are going to get too crazy, but they-- he came out-- - They try. And talked to every single one of us, took a picture with everybody who wanted one. And it was-- it shows that he actually cares. They act like real people. They don't-- they're not like some stars who are all prissy, you know? And they talk about their background, and how they started, and everything. And they try to include us in like mostly every aspect of their lives, so that we feel like we're like with them. And you really realize how they're just like us. They are so relatable. They're really relatable. So relatable. I can like relate to them. They just like talk about pop culture and like relatable things. You're just like them. Normal people. Relatable. There's a lot of reasons why being a teenager sucks. And me and Ricky are here to name a couple for you guys. Number one-- acne. I hate acne. And I'm sure one question every girl gets at one point or another in their life is, how do you know a guy likes me? If you're a freshmen, and you're going into high school, and your first day is coming up-- well, today is your lucky day because I'm here to help you. They know that we go through issues and struggles. They know that we have insecurities and stuff. So they-- they can relate to us more. Which is cool. I like that. I feel good that I can like be on a personal level with them. Me and the guys don't really put off a persona that we're any like bigger than anybody else. We like to like tell people that we're all equal and that, you know, we're just normal kids, just making videos. - I'm not famous. - You're not? This doesn't mean anything. So a couple days ago, I was going through the comments on one of my videos and I came across a question, which asked, Kian, how can I deal with a breakup? It's not a one way show. They're constantly sharing their life. So the fans that come in to see them, they feel connected to them on a level that's more than just a fan admiring a star. They spend that time watching my videos, they spend that time going to that show. I want to spend a little time connecting with them, even deeper than I already do. You're not on my computer screen! Nope. You're so down to earth! Hey, guys! What's up? - It's Kian. - It's Sam. It is Trevor Moran and uh-- you would laugh, if you saw what was behind him. They speak in their contemporaries voice. Would you want to watch a TV show or would you like to turn on YouTube and watch someone that looks like you, sounds like you, and is talking about the things that are relevant to you? It's awesome. - Hi! - Hi! Oh, sorry! I'm so nervous. Oh, don't worry about it. What? No! Is it really? Hold up! Hold up! Don't mess with me. "Echo," right? It's up! It's up! Hi! I brought you a letter, right there. You did? Can I have a selfie? Yes. Thank you. And say hi to Carly. Hi, Carly. I love you. I'm freaking out! My song's out! Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. How are you? And I'm in the middle-- hi. Michael! And I'm in the middle of a meet and great. And I can't do anything about it! Hi! - Hi! Enjoy. Thank you so much. I really like your necklace, by the way. Oh my god! They're so perfect! You and I, we were onto something. Now I'm left with nothing at all! And I want to hear your echo, got to be the name you call! Every time I do it like that, turns out you'll crawl right back! I love it, so what are we going to do? Your mind is running on. Oh! I love it, so what are we going to do? Your mind is running on! You and I, we were onto something, now I'm left with nothing at all! And I want to hear your echo, got to be the name you call! Whoa! Want to hear your echo! Whoa! Whoa! Want to hear echo! I love it, so what are we going to do? Your mind is running on! Whoa! Whoa! Want to hear your echo! Whoa! Whoa! Want to hear your echo! Thank you! You guys are the best! Ready? Come on! Wait. Are you going to sleep on the bus tonight? Yeah. I don't want to have to go bed in the middle of the day. I love you guys. It's like it's so easy to meet them here. Keep the windows up! Do not roll the windows down! Let them through! Let them through! We can't stay. Don't invite no friends. We'll be back, all right? I promise, OK. I don't know. Can I stay now? Like, who's telling me no? - You want to stay? - Yeah. I want to. OK. OK. You guys-- Just stay calm, OK? - Stay calm. - Hi. Hey, thank you so much. You're welcome. Can you take a picture. Guys, so security will kick us out, if we're too loud. You just have to be relaxed. - Wait. Can I have another hug? - Yeah. - You mean the world to me. - You mean the world to me. Thank you. - I love you. Have a good night! We're understaffed. Like we have four people to take care of everything. Yeah. If I wait like an hour and it gives us like 30-- If you wait like an hour or so, then come on back down, and like-- It's just like I go to things that have like 20,000 people and it's not a big deal. So I don't-- We don't have security people. When you see like Rihanna, or like Black Eyed Peas, or something doing it, they have six guys undercover there that are bad asses. It's me, it's Lauren, and it's Nick, who's in merch, you know? Yeah. So like my number one goal is to keep you and make sure those girls are safe. And I know you want to meet your fans and I understand that. And I want you to be able to meet your fans. I'm going. I'll wait. I mean, we just got to be smart. We got to be smart about it. - OK. Guys, I need you back on the other side! Right now! I still can't believe we're on tour, in a way. It's pretty crazy. This the life I want forever. This is fun. I didn't think I was going be all of this glamorous, and chatting, and laughing, and fast Wi-Fi, and-- just happiness. Hi, everybody! It's Trevor Moran. We're at Virginia Beach and it's summer week on 02L. It is. So let's do a day in the life of-- Minus the fast Wi-Fi. Who is this? - Sam. Sam? Hi, Sammy. When this is over, I hope that they can all remain friends forever, that they can look back at this-- this tour-- and just think of all the happy things they've been through together and all the fun times of them just being silly. The memories that they make on the bus-- it's priceless. These boys are so lucky to have each other. They're good kids, so that's why they are where they are. Broken hearts and Styrofoam and empty double cups! I guess I'm-- Right now, we're putting these young legends on the wall of fame next to Ludacris. You know, we got Drop Electric, we got Marvin Gay. I heard y'all sold out in like six minutes, so congratulations. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Who loves 02L? Make some noise! Sorry. Your body goes in this banana now. Oh, wait. Uh, oh. Hold on. I don't think these guys are finished. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got one final surprise for you! Bye, guys! I love you guys so much! I love you! I heard one-- nope! Just stand right there for a minute! Hold up! Hold up! Go back! Go back! Let's go back. One day, it's got to end, right? 02L or a tour? 02L. What happens with you guys? I'm going to cry when 02L ends. Oh, goodbye week. We're still going to be brothers, we're still going to be making videos. Nothing is going to happen. It's just that channel, where we all are on it, it's just going to fade away. What do you think about 02L ending? It'll be sad, just because of the fans. Like they depend on the videos every day and stuff. What? Say something about 02L ending. I don't want it to end. - Are we at that big ass one? - Damn. That's where we're performing? Damn! This is my biggest crowd ever! We got this. I literally feel the panic already. Maybe only 1,000 people show up. I'm getting anxiety. It's epic. I saw him! I'm going to die! Kian! I love you! Can you take a video saying I love Gina? - Gina? - Yes! Please, take my phone. I love you, Gina! Oh my god! Say I love you, Alex! I love you, Alex. I love you guys! I love you! I love you! Oh my god! Kian, you have my Sharpie! Are you guys changing before the red carpet? No. I'm wearing this. - I'm wearing this. - I'm wearing-- Today's really a gathering of YouTube superstars. This is the Instagram room! Look! I don't know how to call this. I've been calling it Digicella. It's been about having an experience for 02L here today, just because of the inundation of fans, which is what they live for. They like doing that sort of thing. Oh my god! I'm going to cry! Ricky, I love you! Ricky! But this is the biggest stage they've played. The scale is significant. Give it up for 02L! What's up, New York City? Hi, everybody! Ricky's going to be out later. Trevor's going to be out later. And around 8:00, we'll all be back! For now, bye, bye! Thank you! Thank you! I love you guys! How are you doing? You're all so amazing. Thank you. Are you guys having fun? All right. This is my first single that I've ever wrote. If you know the words, sing along. This is called, "Ordinary." Chilling on the West Side, playing my song, drive my Kia Soul with my cheap shades on. Going to run right through the night! How's your day going? Good. I'm getting used to it. That's awesome. Tonight we're running around the boulevard! Sales are through the roof. I saw the numbers. And it's incredible. I wrote a whole article on it since then-- the movement and stuff. So it's been-- it's been great. - Yeah. I'm sick and tired of staying up to see the break of dawn. They're taking over the world. I told you guys I was onto something big. And this is just going to be start. We're going to look back and this is going to be small for him pretty soon. Because I don't give a what! Thank you guys so much! All the crowd were fucking sitting there and cheering you on! They fucking loved it! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! - Can I give you a hug? - Yeah. Thank you so much. 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! Please, welcome, for their final performance here, in New York City-- I'm so fucking nervous. It's the same show on a bigger stage! This is who teenagers care about more than any mainstream artist. These are the rock stars of today. There's never been a YouTube group like us that's done this, so it's pretty cool. We love you, New York! It's a rush. I wish that, every night, like I would just be this person. Without them, none of this would ever happen. I love you guys so much. We owe it all to them. I hope go up and forget about us. I'm hoping that they stay together. I love these boys. I would do anything for these boys. Trevor loves these boys. I'm hoping that it will last. 02L, I think we'll be friends for the longest time possible. This is our career. I don't want it ever to stop. I think, if you take somebody's bad day and turn it around, just because you sat there and shared your daily fun with them, that's a well spent life. 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L! 02L!
