Help! Help! Somebody! That scared the living crap out of me. Meryl Streep that girl was not. Who's Meryl Streep? Oh, Zoe, she's like Katie Holmes to our parents, okay? So, what's next, ladies? I have to go home. No. Yeah, make that a block from home. I can't have another close encounter with my parents. They think I'm home in bed. Were you kids in bed at a reasonable hour? I stayed up till 10:00. After 9:00, Rhett was fast asleep. Who's driving these monsters? I will. Nicki's selling coffee at school and I promised I'd help her. Hmm. I know, it sucks. Do not say "sucks." Say "disappoints" or "bites." I don't need a lunch. I can walk across the street with Tash. And have pizza three days in a row? I think not. That's really good. The proportions are perfect, but are you drawing what you're really seeing? The simplest thing is the hardest. To see what's really right in front of you. Hey, so what mad fun is on for tonight? Oh, I am so grounded. I got busted by my 'rents sneaking back inside last night. Damn, girl, how'd you manage that? My dad set the motion detector. It seems like our parents are getting paranoid about us in their old age. Mine still trust me. It's beautiful. Well, it hasn't been a bad couple of decades, considering. For me? Better than the first two without you. To 20 years of you and me. And to our children, safe at home. Cool, you lost them! Totally macho Mustang boys, too boot. Boo-yah! We struck a blow for sisterhood. That's the only "blow" you know, sister. Diss. So what's the rave scene this weekend? Full Moon Underground. I've been hearing San Bernardino. Probably Saturday. I'm gonna tell my mom I'm staying over at your house, okay, Tash? I cannot believe you can still work that old scam. What can I say? My 'rents are just adorably clueless. So, I'll bring the glowsticks if somebody else buys the gas. Oh, that's such a good idea. Nice try, beams. Rest up, it's gonna be one hell of a weekend. Bye, Tasha. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Hasta. All right. Hasta. Now they call the cops on me. Hello? Hello? I'm sorry I'm late. Ruby Baker? Yeah, I'm Ruby. And, you know, whatever they said, I'm not missing. I just went out. Your parents were in a car accident. Are they okay? Ruby, why don't you have a seat, hon? Are they okay? My partner's gonna help you to have a seat. Ruby. I can sit down myself! I understand. I said, are they okay? Relax. I need you to relax. Why won't you answer me? We're here to help you. You're gonna be okay. Relax. Ruby? Ruby! Ruby! She will be okay. Get her pulse. Can you hear me, Ruby? They are as asleep. In the morning they are like grass which groweth up. In the morning, it flourisheth and groweth up. In the evening, it is cut down and withereth. For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled. Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. For all our days are passed away in thy wrath. We spend our years as a tale that is told, so teach us to number our days. So that we may apply our hearts into wisdom. I think Rhett Baker wants to come up and say something. Rhett? I just… I… I just wanna say… I… I just… It's okay. I didn't work with Dave and Grace or see them every day, but I knew them both for ten years, and I'm sure if they could hear all this… Well, Grace would do her dismissive little giggle. You know the one. And Dave would mutter an expletive deleted. They would just hate to be remembered as anything but ordinary. Which is exactly what they were. Anything but ordinary. But they will live on through their children and in all our hearts. Ruby? Do you remember me? I'm your Uncle Jack, your mom's brother. I'll go wait by the car, okay? Look, I just want you to know if there's anything that you need, anything I can do… I don't mean in the next few weeks or months, I mean anytime. How come I haven't seen you in, like, I don't know, ten years? Have you even met my brother Rhett? Of course I have. I haven't seen either of you in years, but, first of all, I live pretty far away, in Chicago. Then how are you gonna help us? I don't know. There's the phone, there's e-mail. You and my mom never did write each other though. That's true. You know, Ruby, as siblings get older, sometimes they go their separate ways. I know you and Rhett are close now. No, we're not. Discounting DNA, we have nothing in common. I used to feel that way about your mom. It's not true. I used to think that when things slowed down, I'd take a month off and come out here, and get to know you and your brother and Grace again. It's nice to see you again. I'm sorry things didn't work out. I'll call you later, okay? Okay. Ruby? Hi. I'm Alvin Begleiter. Hi. I'm so sorry. I'm your… Was your parents' estate lawyer. I helped them plan their wills, what it is that they wanted to do with their money and… Well, actually the most important issue right now, is who's going to be taking care of you. You and Rhett. I'm assuming that you know the Glasses, correct? They were my next-door neighbors. I've known them my whole life. That's good, because I know that your parents chose them after a great deal of consideration. You know, there's something else. Your parents were extremely thrifty, and with your mom's share of the inheritance, your dad's life insurance, there's more than enough for you and Rhett for the rest of your lives. Well, then, obviously you don't know Rhett. That's good. I like that. I'm gonna give you one of my cards. I don't expect any trouble. But if you have any concerns, any problems, I'm an estate lawyer, but I'm also what they call a trust lawyer. And I wanna be someone you can trust. You call me, okay? Okay. Mr. Glass. Ruby. Thank you. My mom and dad would have really loved that speech. They would have loved it. Come here. That's good. We're gonna get through this. We're gonna get through it together, okay? Oh, Ruby. You're in good hands. Hey! You guys ready for Malibu? It'll be a big change, we won't lie. But it's not the worst place either. Cool! Is this your car? You in there already? My company's, on loan for today. Sweet. This place is huge. Hey, Rubes, check out this view. Yeah, it's pretty amazing. Cool! A meteorite. It's art. It's art, Rhett. Terry, give them the grand tour. Stall them while I order some dinner. Let's get the lay of the land. So, master suite. Home gym. Home theater. Sweet. It's like you never have to leave home. Oh, if only. This is Vicki. She comes in most days. Hello. This is your room. It's just temporary quarters, of course. Well, you unpack, get settled, and I'll meet you in the kitchen. We're sharing a room? If you even glance at me when I'm changing for bed, you are so busted. Okay, we have a little calamari, we have a little risotto with portabella mushrooms. Mmm! And a little green salad with some Swiss chard. Do you have any Garfield? What is that? It's crap in a can. If it's crap, how come you eat it? Come on, kids. Try the calamari. Isn't that squid? Honey, tonight… I'll call Domino's. Thank you. Can't you just turn and face the wall? Who are you, the Blair Witch? No, I'm worse. Can you just face the goddamn wall? Turn that stupid thing off. Honey, there's public school, and then there's public school. Trust me, there won't be any Bloods or Crips. I'm not scared of getting gunned down. Ruby, you're a great kid. You're gonna have… It's not about being great or not great. It's about being… New? Middle-of-the-year new. Look, there's a little saying that we teach to the patients in the pain ward. This too shall pass. This too shall pass. This too shall pass. Hi. Why don't you just take a seat in the back? We have a new addition. Would you introduce yourself, Miss Baker? You just did. Hi. I'm Ruby Baker. I used to go to Shady Lane. That's in the Valley. That's not my choice, it was just an accident of birth. So how come you moved here now? That's another accident. Let's all make Ruby feel welcome. Thanks for the lift, Vicki. Sweet! I can't believe it. I can't believe it! Neither can I. Like one of those isn't noisy and obnoxious enough. No, Rubes, because you can't play Pokemon Snap on Playstation. But you can play Ape Escape, but you can't on N-64. Mom and Dad would totally just freak out. Don't talk about Mom and Dad. I haven't even seen, like, one girl with blue-black hair. And all the guys spend all day surfing and swimming, that whole bizarre physical culture of sun-worshipping. Well, that sounds fairly hot. So, anyway, I was crazy checking my pager all day, 'cause I figured you'd call, and you didn't. I was just dying to call you at lunch but the cell phones are banned at the school. And, like, the kids just don't care. You know, they just can't see that they've lost their civil liberties. Probably 'cause they have so much sunstroke, they're, like, permanently wasted. Ruby? I got us an assortment of different things this time. Some cold pastas, some salads. Ruby, I really think that you would be well served by a better attitude. It's… It's okay. I don't mind take-out. I know that you guys are busy. It's not like it's from Wendy's or anything. I'm speaking about your attitude toward your new school. My attitude? I overheard your conversation. You were listening in on my call? No, I was trying to get a line out, but that's beside the point. The point is, you need those kids to like you. Otherwise you're just going to isolate yourself, sabotage yourself. You're going to have a miserable time. Okay, I get it. I learned something. Ruby? Ruby. Wake up. I'm awake. Wake up. Mommy? Mommy? My God, you scared the crap out of me. Well, I heard noises. I thought it was a burglar or a coyote. I'm not used to having kids in the house. Come here. Thank you. You gotta be freezing. So no more 3:00 a.m. swims, okay? With all the glass, you can hear everything. I gotta start setting the alarm at night. Are you coming? Though drunk-driving among California teens has been steadily decreasing, we can still do better. As these images starkly attest, alcohol remains the number one drug problem among young people today. This year, more than 20% of teenage drivers… So, how was your first day of driver's ed? Fine, I guess. They still show those gruesome movies? Honey, those were the dark ages. I'm sure they have more enlightened ways of teaching kids today, don't they? May I be excused? Stupid kid-proof piece of crap. Ruby? Was it awful? I mean, the driving class? I can just imagine. No, it's… I have my period. Oh. Well, come with me. Thank you. Four out of five doctors recommend. This cramp, too, shall pass. I'll turn it off just as soon as I get to a safe point. It's cool. I don't care. It's kind of relaxing. Erin! Get out of there! What were you doing in the bathroom? Tell me the truth! What are you implying with that question? You tell me. No, I'm not going to answer you. Good night. What the hell were you doing? Getting ready for bed. I'm tired. Watch your language. There's kids in the house. Don't play games with me, Erin. Don't play games with me. You know exactly what I'm talking about. I'm too tired to even guess what you're picking at. I am sick of your accusations. Tired? Is that what you call it now? How many times have I asked… I've done everything you've asked me to do. So help me… Ruby? Hi, I'm Hannah. Hi. Hi. So, there's this rumor you were on academic probation at your old school. Cut to the chase, huh? I was, and then I had sex with the dean of students, and he took it off my record. Oh, not really. I was supposed to be at my friend Tasha's house one Saturday night doing an essay on the Yalta conference, and went to this rave instead. Come Sunday, I was totally fried and downloaded this thing off the Net. Tuesday, I was busted. Hannah! Hey! I gotta go. Bye. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, Ruby. There's a premiere in Westwood, and my company's driving a bunch of people. I gotta stop by and make sure everything's running smooth. You wanna come? Well, I have homework tonight. Probably three more hours. Pretty heavy, so… That's perfect. So, are we going to catch the tail end of the movie or go straight to the party? Actually, the hell with Westwood. If my drivers can't handle a lousy premiere… Evening, sir. Mud pie for the lady, Ketel One, rocks, for me. Great. Thank you. That party'd be a mob scene. What I really want to do is talk to you. - Here you are. - Thank you. I remember when you guys moved down the block, what, 11 years ago? It was funny. I noticed the furniture as they brought it in. Erin noticed there was a little girl. But you were upset. I guess about moving cross-country. You wouldn't say a word. Just hugged this plastic doll against your little chest. Malibu Barbie, I think it was. Prophetic, huh? I think you mean "pathetic." No, no, no. I guess you moved on years ago. From what? From hugging plastic dolls. I should hope so. Last night, when you two were fighting, it had nothing to do with us, right? No, no, no, no, no. Married people sometimes like to push each other's buttons just because they can. It's another form of intimacy. A lower form, but nothing serious. There's one thing I haven't told you about Erin. It can be lonely living with her. But that's my cross to bear. Not yours. I think it's past my bedtime, Terry. Of course it is. Let's get you to bed. Terry. You're not wearing your shoulder belt. Hey. Try not to make too much noise. I'm sure Rhett and Erin are asleep. Okay? Hamlet senses something's wrong right under his nose, that he alone can set right. I want two pages next Friday on what he means, and whether he succeeds. Mr. Begleiter, before my parents… Um… Did they ever talk to you about finding different guardians for Rhett and me? Different from the Glasses? Mmm-mmm. Well, I think that they wanted to. They talked about that with you? No. But my parents weren't nearly as friendly with them after they moved. Well, Ruby, the Glasses aren't your parents. They're never gonna be your parents. But if Erin or Terry has done anything… We sleep in one room, Rhett and me. Well, that's not ideal. And then, the other night, we were alone in Terry's car, and he… What? What'd he do? He just put my seat belt on. But the way he leaned across me, it wasn't… It just… And I felt… I know it sounds stupid. But… And then I walked in and Erin was shooting up. I saw her holding a needle. Anyway, she looked really baked. Ruby. Ruby, try and understand this. The accident, in effect, orphaned you and your brother. So, if this doesn't work out with the Glasses, you have no place to go. You're gonna become wards of the state. And I'm not trying to scare you. I'm just telling you the facts of life. I drove halfway here from Malibu with the housekeeper, and then I hitchhiked the rest of the way, and I was really scared. But I kept telling myself, once I made it, you'd help me and Rhett. When we met, you said you were somebody I could trust. Okay. All right. I believe you, and I know who to get in touch with. It's not gonna be easy. I can't promise you any results. But I can promise you that I will look into this. You have my word on that. Thank you. When we spoke after the funeral… Mmm-hmm? Uh… You had said that… We had more than enough. Mmm-hmm. How much would that be, exactly? Well, that's really a question for the trust officer over at the LA Federal Bank. But between us? Four million dollars. So you can see, you're financially very secure. Yeah. Now why don't you run on home and do me one more favor? No hitchhiking. This is out, okay? Yes, sir. Yeah, Alvin Begleiter calling. I just had a real disturbing visit from Ruby Baker. Rhett, why don't you leave that now? Go and do some homework. I have a bunch of homework to do, too. Stay a minute, would you? What you walked in on last night isn't what you think. Erin suffers from diabetes. I've kept that private. It's not something I want to worry you or Rhett about. The disease is under control. So what you saw last night was Erin giving herself her nightly insulin injection. It must've been a shock to walk in on. One more thing. Terry tells me that… You got a little skittish with him last night. That makes us feel sad. We want you to trust us, Ruby. We need your trust. I know I overreacted. I'm sorry. There are still some things that I need to get used to around here. We all do. We're all under stress. I'm gonna go begin my Hamlet paper. Well, hey, if you need any help, let me know. That'd be great. That's fine, and now you're gonna put the car in park… And step out. Mmm-hmm. And Ruby, you're going to get behind the wheel next. You can apply a little more gas, Ruby. I'm sorry, I'm a real bad driver. There aren't any bad drivers, just inexperienced ones. Now take a breath, Ruby. Let's start driving back again. No, Mr. Robinson, I'm sorry, he's not in right now, but I'll have him call you back as soon as he can. Hi. Uh… I'm Ruby Baker. I'm, uh, Terry's… I know who you are, Ruby. Okay, cool. Uh… I stopped by to catch a ride home from Terry when he's ready. He's having a powwow with some people right now, but if you want to wait, there's a really nice lounge behind me. Okay, thank you. Glass Transit. How may I help you? Any available service technician, please come to the office. May I have the phone number please? Okay, is he arriving at 8:00 p.m… So, what's going on, Terry? Oh, the usual. But not to worry, fellas. It's nothing that can't be handled. Mr. Glass, we had a payment plan. The dates arrive, the money doesn't. About that payment plan, in the cold light of day, I would have to call it unrealistic. You proposed that plan. Yeah, I know. I know. It's not dishonesty. You gotta give me that. What is it, Terry, if not dishonesty? Naive optimism. But then again, I'm an optimist by nature. That's how I succeed in business, by betting on myself. I'll be right with you. Where is the money we loaned you, Mr. Glass? You're not listening. The money will be… Don't say "will be," always say "is," as in "the money is…" Yeah. Can I help you? Whose car is this? Hell if I know. Just showed up one day. One day when? Uh, I don't know, a few months ago. We used to have a car kind of like this. You know, you really shouldn't be back here. Ruby! Ruby! What happened before was nothing. It was just a business glitch. Hope you didn't get freaked. People get very weird about money. I didn't mean to, uh, just show up like that. You know, I waited for Vicki, and she never came. Yeah, we had to let Vicki go. Erin was coming for you, but she got held up at the hospital. Wait, back up. You had to let Vicki go? Yeah, we had to. She drove you somewhere without anyone's permission. Just to Santa Monica, to the promenade, to hang out with some kids. Mmm-hmm. How did you know that she drove me? How did we know? It's our job to know. Did you have a hard day at work, Erin? Oh, it was fine, Ruby, thank you. Hamlet. Don't you hate how he can't make up his mind? Mmm-hmm. To be, not be, not, not be, be, be, not. My father drove a Saab. Terry! Thank you. You know, finishing my paper. Ah, that would be wrong. Ruby? Yeah? Would you mind coming with me? Sure. Ruby Baker? I'm Nancy Ryan. I'm an inspector with the Department of Social Services. Your estate lawyer let us know that you may have some problems with your guardians. Is that right? Ruby, please relax and be open with me. Everything said here stays private, okay? So, you're 16, and your brother is 11. And you're currently sharing a bedroom. Yeah, for now. And, you saw Erin Glass injecting herself? They said she has diabetes. Diabetes? Okay, I'm gonna double-check that. You're writing down everything I say, so that now it's gonna be in writing twice. My word's still not gonna count for shit next to Terry Glass and Dr. Glass, right? Which is why, when we're done, I'm gonna phone the Glasses and ask them to meet me at their home so that I can verify everything with my own eyes. Okay? But… Then how am I gonna live with them if they know that I told on 'em? Do you want to live with them? Sometimes things are fine. Last night, Terry helped me with something, but maybe that was just to keep me happy, keep my mouth shut. I know this is scary for you, but you don't have to worry. In a situation like this, we tell the guardians that we're performing a routine site inspection. If it's still in progress when you get home, you just act like we've never met or spoken. You have no idea why I'm there. Okay? Ms. Ryan, this is my husband, Terry Glass. Hello. Hello. Is this really necessary in the middle of a business day? I mean, 15 minutes notice? We're gonna get this done as quickly as possible, Mr. Glass. Feels like an intrusion. Let's get it over with. May I… TERRY: Of course. It looks like only one child sleeps in here. Yes, Rhett. Rhett, yes. And the girl, Ruby, she has her own room? Of course. She's 16. Nice accommodations. I think the kids are home. Would you like to meet them? Yes, I would. Just to say hi. Oh, but first, Dr. Glass, may I look upstairs? I know this is awkward, but it's also important. It's a matter of child safety, just ensuring there's nothing dangerous in easy reach of an 11-year-old. "Humulin L and U." Diabetes. I'm type one, insulin dependent. And we have it totally under control. It would appear that you do. There's the two best kids in the world. Hi. You must be Rhett. I'm Nancy Ryan. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So, Rhett, how do you spend your evenings? Well, when I finish my homework, I read. And you must be Ruby. You have a very nice room. Sorry for the inconvenience. You've made a wonderful home for these children. Thank you, Dr. Glass. Thank you. Oh. We'll see you out. You read? You lie. Guess who I learned from? Good-bye now. Why don't we order some dinner, hon? So, how do you like your new room? It couldn't have come at a better time. Come on, Mr. Begleiter. Hello? So sorry to disturb you at your home at this late hour. But I found myself wide awake and wondering, "Where's the money?" Well, you might as well know. Six months ago, I took on a partner, a silent partner. And, it just recently came to my attention that the little son of a bitch was skimming cash. You lost me. What does this all have to do with our little loan? I'm waiting, Mr. Glass. Mr. Glass, you still there? Yeah. He was charging a whole host of personal expenses to the company. Guess what, Terry. Whenever I want to hear a heartbreaking human interest story, I can watch the local news. Meanwhile, your next payment is due tomorrow, close of business. Do you fully understand me, Mr. Glass? Mr. Glass? Yeah, I'm here. And I'm seeking full restitution from my silent partner. Plus, I found a whole new source of equity. My big, new personal piggy bank. So you can expect another 30 grand from me right off the bat. That barely covers the interest. You need to start paying off the principal, my friend. Of course, but the point is that I need some more time. Not a lot more time. A week at the most. A week at the most? We'll give you two days, as a favor, because we like you, and because we'd hate for you to come home tomorrow night and find your beautiful house burned down with your wife inside. Yeah? "I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul," "freeze thy young blood," "make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres" "and each particular hair to stand on end." "If thou didst ever thy dear father love," "revenge his foul and most unnatural murder." "Murder most foul…" "But this most foul, strange, and unnatural." Begleiter, Tepper and Brice. Hello, this is Ruby Baker for Mr. Begleiter, please. One moment, please. Hello, Ruby. Did you get my e-mail? No, 'cause Terry trashed my AOL account. Or maybe the bill just didn't get paid in the confusion of your move. Whatever. Did you find out about the BMW? Right, the BMW. Yeah, it was registered to a business, G.T.I. Glass Transit, Incorporated. Terry's company. So now don't you get it? Ruby, please come with me. I think I have to call you back later. Bye-bye. This is Miss Bassett, our vice principal. Ruby, the paper that you turned in to Mr. Kim, that was your work, nobody helped you? No. Not even Harold Bloom? The phrase "Hamlet's dance of contraries" didn't sound like one of my students. I found it and other sentences and phrases in Mr. Bloom's recent book, Shakespeare: The Invention Of The Human. We were told there's already one case of plagiarism on your school record. Do you understand why we have to take decisive action in a situation like this? You were told? By who? That is hardly the issue here, young lady. This sort of cheating has to have real consequences. We've already spoken to your guardians. Of course you have. And frankly, we're not sure whether you can continue at this school. Well? Why don't you ask Terry? Or maybe it's time you started taking some personal responsibility, Ruby. Yeah, maybe it's time. Hi, you've reached Jack Avery. I'm out of the country, but I'll be checking my machine occasionally, so leave a message. Come on, Rhett. Wake up. Oh… Shh, don't make a sound, okay? I'm gonna get you dressed. We're gonna go. Where? With who? Away with me. Hey, quit it. You're looking. Right, like there's something to see. It's raining. I was sleeping. I don't wanna go. Yes, you do, it's gonna be really fun. They're giving away free Dragon Ball Z tapes at Blockbuster and we can get in line real early and avoid the rush. Really? Whoa! Close the door. What if they find out? I'll take the blame, okay? Just get in the car. You don't know what you're doing, huh? You wanna slow down a little? One thing I learned from Terry, buckle up. Whoa! Rubes, Terry's gonna kill you! Maybe so. Turn that off. Turn that shit off! Look out! You almost creamed that guy. That's right. Now turn it off! I wanna go back. We're not going back. What do you mean, "We're not going back"? That's what I said, genius. Figure it out. We have to go back! You tricked me into this, and now I'm gonna get in trouble. No, they tricked you, the Glasses. What do you mean? Did not. They were sleeping. What I mean is they were gonna send me away to the middle of goddamn nowhere, so I couldn't be any more trouble, and you'd just stay home with Terry and Erin. I like Terry. I like Erin. No, you like all the shiny shit that they blinded you with, so you couldn't see what was right under your nose. They made you lie to that social worker. She could've helped us. I didn't know that she was a social worker, okay? All I knew was… That you didn't want to be separated from your beloved Nintendo. They bought you off. Where are you taking us? I don't know yet. The point was just to get away. Crap. Just don't say anything stupid. The highway is closed from here to Sunset. There's a mud slide. You're gonna have to use Malibu Canyon or… Can I see your driver's license, Miss? My driver's license? And your registration, too, please. It's over there in all of my stuff. I think I saw it over here. I'm gonna have to ask you to pull onto the shoulder and step out of the car, please. Officer! These are my kids. Terry Glass, Glass Transit. The limos we loaned you for last year's parade? Oh, yeah! How are you? Rhett, you poor baby, come with me. It's okay. We have a little behavioral problem back at the old homestead. She's going through a really hard time right now, sweetheart. God only knows what's going on in her mind. Well, you know, teenage girl stuff. Gotcha. Good luck. Move over, hon. You can turn around right here. Thanks. Don't you have anything to say to me? You killed my parents. That's not just insane, it's hurtful. You were obviously threatened by your business associates. I saw it. Like Erin said to me the other day, "We need your trust, Ruby." You need my trust, for sure. Four million dollars' worth. I got a thriving business. My wife is a successful doctor. I got a big, new… New personal piggy bank! That's just words out of context. Just words. What about your BMW my dad was driving that night? And what about it? For your parents' anniversary, I lent them a beamer so Dave wouldn't have to drive Grace around in that dinky old Saab, which I hammered out and repainted. No good deed goes unpunished, huh? Because in your trashy teenage mind, you twisted that into… What do you think? I what? Cut the steering linkage? Stripped the brakes? Yeah. It's understandable. It's basic psychology, you know? 'Cause you don't wanna blame your dad for what happened. The fact that he had too much booze in him that night. Then you'd have to ask yourself why your mom and dad were hitting the bottle so hard. Whose bad behavior had driven them to drink? Get this straight, Ruby. You and Rhett are mine. Now I suggest you forget your lurid, adolescent female fantasies and start… Help! Help! Let go, you bastard! Better calm down, little girl. Help! Ow! What's happening out there? Your sister is having a tantrum, honey. Come on. Come back to bed. No! Let me go! Get off! Let go! Now listen hard, Ruby. Anything happens to you, we got Rhett for seven more years and all we need is one surviving child. Erin! Erin, stop him, please! Please! Erin! Erin, please come help me. Please! He's not gonna hurt you, I promise. Please! Shh. No! Erin, please, no! Erin, no! No! Thank you for being such a good listener. You'll feel better now, Ruby. Rest, relax. Now where to, ladies? I vote the mall. Hey, wait, timeout. Has anyone heard from Ruby? Me? Not for a month. Same. Won't even answer my e-mails. What up with Little Miss Malibu? Too busy bodysurfing for her old gal pals? Well, then, we are too busy for her. Hello? Where is the rest of our money, Mr. Glass? You're just not gonna believe this. The bank mailed me a check, but with the wrong zip code. Some incompetent jerk at the bank inverted the last two digits. So basically I will need another… Next in line. We gotta expand the house. A wing for the kids. Sir. Our little boy is getting bigger and bigger every day. Of course, the girl's a teen. I don't know if you've got any kids of your own… Anyway, construction costs in Malibu are off the charts, and I'm estimating a quarter million, minimum. Well, we'll need to see blueprints, Mr. Glass. There's an approval process. Well, you can't get blueprints without an architect, and my architect is looking for cash down payment. He's in demand. I believe we advanced you $30,000 for that purpose just last month. But that was for a room, Ted. Before I realized I needed a wing. And isn't it a general principle of a guardianship to keep the children comfortable? Here's the trust document. It authorizes me to use trust money to enlarge the house. And isn't it also a general principle that the guardians aren't supposed to suffer economically in the fulfillment of their obligations? Mr. Glass… I'm paying two tuitions at the Westcott School. I'm employing a full-time nanny. These kids are seeing top therapists to help them deal with a tragedy. I'm planning family trips to broaden their horizons, and it's like a root canal every time I need reimbursement. Where did you get that? I thought you faxed it to us last week. Which is why I'm surprised to hear you say you have both children enrolled at Westcott. Did I say Westcott? We changed our minds about Westcott. It's too glitzy. Listen, we gotta do what's best for the children. Isn't that the truth? Thank you for waiting, Doctor. I can take your order now. Yes, I need five dozen 10 cc syringes fentanyl, and I need two dozen 20 cc syringes Demerol. We sent up 60 of fentanyl on Monday, Doctor. Yes, but as I noted in the chart, I had to double the PC infusion rate of Demerol in six patients. Dr. Glass? Deidre, I'll be right with you. I'm on the phone with the pharmacy. Dr. Wise wants to see you in his office. The medical director. Wake up, Ruby. Sleeping beauty. All you do is sleep. It scares me. So you're losing your medical license. That's wonderful. I have a sickness. Yeah. It's called self-pity. Complicated by being born without a freaking backbone. So I'm weak, am I? Maybe I am. But at least I'm not hopelessly greedy and reckless, borrowing a million dollars from some loan sharks and Tarzana and… Which I would've paid off by now! We had a good thing going until you stuck your hand in the cookie jar. A good thing? You son of a bitch! I was a doctor. Yeah, but you turned yourself into a junkie. Not until you did what you did. Where were you when I did it? Right. I saw an opportunity, Erin. I saw an opportunity, and I grabbed it because I had what you didn't. I had the nerve, the will. Since nobody was giving me a second chance, I just took it. I'm not doing this anymore. Listen, it's already done. What this is about is containing the damage, you understand? Good. You know we're gonna have to get rid of the girl. Speaking of which, we're dry, aren't we? We've got nothing to take care of Ruby with, so I guess I have to go out and get something. And if I can't find drugs in LA… Hi. Wave at the camera, Ruby. Wave at the camera. They can't catch me. Come in the water, Erin! Wait for me! I'm coming, too! Okay. Spin me, Erin! Faster! Whoo! Rhett. Rhett, move away. Erin! It took some doing, but finally I found some pharmaceutical morphine. Erin? God, not now. Erin. Erin! 1875 Montego Canyon. Well, I thought you'd want to know. Ruby? Honey? Terry needs to sit down and talk to you kids. Shh. You kids are a handful, you know that? Where's your sister, eh? Where's your damn sister? Let go off of me! This is where I should've put you from day one. Ah. What's happening? He just pulled out the Jag. He just walked back in the house. Okay, just keep working. He's sleeping. He fell asleep. There's gonna be a change of plans, okay? Why would he do that? He's bombed! He's finished off a bottle of vodka. Look, it's right there on the floor. I think I see what's really right in front of me. Begleiter, what's going on? Mr. Glass, you ought to have your wife take a look at that. She's not at home. You know, I called your office and they said that you'd be at home. I kept calling here and nobody answered, so here I am. The bank has blocked your guardianship account, pending an investigation. The trust officer, he believes there's malfeasance. The sons of bitches. Mr. Glass, I went out on a hell of a limb for you. I warned you about the girl's claims, about her e-mails, about her accusations because I trusted you and the Bakers trusted you. But if you've been lying, then the courts are going to step in, and if these children are taken from you, they have no place to go. He thought he was helping us. Mr. Glass, where are the children? At their music lessons. Their piano lessons. You just watch. Next, I'll have to buy them a Steinway, and the chintzy bastards at the bank will say, "Can't they learn to play the kazoo?" No. That's my Testarossa. No, that's our Testarossa. You see, until we get our money back, it's our Testarossa, Terry. So you planned to skip town this morning? Leave us in a lurch, buddy boy? That's nuts. Where'd you get an idea like that? Well, your wife was kind enough to call us this morning, give us a little heads-up. My wife? Uh-huh. So before you leave town, how about repaying the entire loan in one lump cash sum? That son of a bitch doesn't have our money. What's going on, Terry? Ask him. Your silent partner? Bastard robbed me blind. Oh, my God. I'm leaving. No, no, no, no, no. You're not going anywhere. Really? Yeah, I think we're entitled to an explanation. From me? Mmm-hmm. I have absolutely nothing to do with this. Nobody listens anymore. You happy, Terry? Feel good about that? Damn it, Terry, you're a troublemaker. I guess that took care of the problem. No, no, no, come on. We're gonna discuss this in the car. Come on. There's nothing to discuss. Terry, just walk like a man out to the Jag, all right? That was the whole problem, you've dealt with it. The rest is pure profit. Just not the Jag, okay? The Volvo. Wait here for one minute, okay? Nice little drive in our car. No, not in there! No, not in there! No! Not in there! I don't even have the keys to the damn car. Don't sweat it, Terry, we've got all the keys to all the cars. Take the Volvo, not the Jag, huh? Let's go! Hey, let's go! Okay! You win, you win, you win! You win? It's over, okay? But just please take the Volvo. Okay? You're making this difficult, Terry. Whatever. Take the Volvo. Brand loyalty. I like that, Ter. Oh, that little bitch. You know, you're some kind of joker. We're gonna take the Jaguar. No! Hey, you haven't been to our Tarzana office, have you, Mr. Glass? We even got a handball court and a sauna. And way in the back we have this, uh, special room. Totally soundproof. What the… What the fuck! What'd you do to this car? What'd you do to this car? Hi. You guys need some help? Yes. Got everything under control? Yeah, we got it covered, thanks. Terry. You two kids stay in the car. 5-L-1-10, I have a possible TC over the side. Southbound, Malibu Canyon. - I'll be out to investigate. - Copy that. 5-L-1-10, I have a rollover TC with one fatality. I'm gonna need two backup units. 10-4. Ruby! It's okay. Ruby, go! Drive! Where's the stupid key? It's okay. Quick, get us outta here! Let's go! Come on, find them! Ruby! Need your help. He's getting closer, Ruby! I got 'em! He's getting closer! Drive, drive, drive! Why are you stopping? Get us outta here! It's okay, honey! Buckle up! What are you doing? Buckle up! It's all forgiven. Ruby, what are you doing? You two okay? Go back and wait by my car. Things will get easier from here on. They already have. Let's go home.
