[♪♪♪] AIRPORT P.A.: American Airlines welcomes you to Los Angeles International Airport. Ground transportation can be found at the lower level. There you go, sir. Next. Claim check, please. Get this morbid piece of junk out of here. You hear me, Wiley? I've got as much right to be here as both you guys. Anyway, I'm picking up a customer today. Sure you are, Wiley. Claim check, please. Hi. Uh, yes, ma'am. We seem to have a little problem here because I've lost my claim checks. I need to see two claim checks, honey. I understand. Man, you buzz off, or you're gonna be riding in the back of this thing. Sure. That's funny. All right, what's happening here? This guy's got no license. He's always pulling this bullshit, man. Yeah! Talk to me, kid. I'm picking up a customer today. Yeah? From which flight? Well, it's a tragedy, sir. It'd probably break your heart, but... Mm-hm. Do you know Freddy Krueger? Yeah. Much worse than him. I'm telling you, this is a scam. Okay, where's the body? And I'm looking for a cab. There he is right there! What are you trying to pull now, Wiley? Will you get this guy out of here, man? We got a job to do. Can you help me find a cab? Your limo's here, sir. - My limo's here? - Your limo's here. My limo's here. Where are you going? How's the fever? What fever? Hey, look, if you get a little queasy, just let me know, all right. That's no limo. Hey, wait a minute, pal. Wait a minute. I'm not so sure I want to go where you're going. Sure you do. You're in L.A. Now. Hit it, kid. Hey, I owe you one. So did my uncle send you? Uncle? Sorry, I'm strictly free-lance, but I'll take you wherever you want to go. By way of Acapulco, right? So you're an athlete, huh? Yeah. I play basketball in Milwaukee. For the Bucks? Yeah, for the Bucks. Good. What is this dead movie star business? It's pretty catchy, right? See, everybody sells maps to movie stars' homes. Too much competition. Had to come up with a little gimmick, you know? Wiley Hunter's Gravesites of the Rich and Famous. Press that button. [GHOULISH SHRIEKING] Adds a little pizazz, huh? Yeah. [GHOULISH SHRIEKING CONTINUES] Your basic mix of rockers, punks, actors... members of major satanic cults. It's home. You're funny, man. Yes, who is it? Uh, it's Monroe. Drive on in, please. Think this place has a gift shop? Oh, definitely. Wow. Is this your uncle's house? I don't know. I've never been here before. Not too shabby. Not too shabby. You must be Monroe. Yes. How are you? Hola! Hola, guapa! Look, don't worry about this guy. - He's crazy. - I won't. Well, it doesn't look like you're gonna have too much trouble coming up with 50 bucks, are you? 50 bucks? - 20. - 30. Yeah, 20. Okay, 20 bucks. 20. Thank you. Thank you. Sure. I'll be seeing you. Not if I see you first, pal. Hey, if you make it to the beach, I'll be in Hermosa. Third in the strand. Hey! What? Thanks, man. Thank you. [GHOULISH SHRIEKING] Hi. Yes, I know, it's a real palace. You'll get used to it. Yeah. Your uncle said that you should make yourself comfortable. The driver will pick you up for the office at 8:00 a.m. Don't be late. All right! Whoo! Excuse me. I'm here to see my uncle, Max Clark. I'll get his assistant, Marie. Have a seat. Thank you. Monroe? Yes. Come with me. Okay. He's right in there. Thank you. [LAUGHING] Huh? Huh? Ah, you're right on time. Sit down, son. Thank you, sir. So how the hell are you? I'm good. I'm good. Obviously not as good as you, though. Well, not many people are. And it's Uncle Max to you, all right? How's my brother? Everybody's great. Family's good, everybody's fine? Yeah, everybody's good. You know, I was you once, young, ambitious... needed a mentor. Modeled my whole career after a man named Darrow. - Clarence? - Who? Clarence. No, Eddie. Divorce lawyer from Pasadena. Here's those files you asked for. Thank you, sweetie. Hello? [LAUGHS] So when do we get into court? Whoa! Whoa! Wait, wait. Slow down. Slow down. Let me tell you a little bit about the business you're getting yourself into first, all right? Real estate law, Monroe, despite what you may think, is not all glamour and perks, okay? I mean, you know, even if... even if you make it to the top of your profession, you're not going to be on the 6:00 news, but... on the other hand, you may end up owning the station. Huh? Here. See these? Hmm? Deadbeats. Hmm? Liars. Scum. Criminals? Tenants. Each one of those files represents a tenant who's either refused to pay or is unable to pay our clients the money owed. In either case, your job-- hello, Monroe-- is to serve these deadbeats with a notice to pay or quit. Well, that doesn't sound too tough. Well, it's not too tough, unless you're the poor sap who can't come up with the rent. [LAUGHS] Anyway, you're not in this for a popularity contest. You're in this business to make money, not friends, right? Absolutely, sir. I'm gonna throw in a company car, all right? Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Happy hunting, kid, all right?. Okay, sir. Good to see-- Oh, Monroe... be back at 6:00.

I went to this guy, and I said, "Look, help me out here," and all of a sudden this guy punches me in the stomach, and I got four guys jumping on me, kicking the hell out of me-- Kicking the shit out me. Next thing I know, I'm being dragged-- To the beach. To the beach. Because that would explain the sand on... the files. Yeah, I'm sorry about-- Sorry about that. So that's... that's your story? That's what you're going to stick with? Yes, sir. This is real good, Monroe. Not just the ability to lie, the ability to tell such an outrageously stupid story in the face of unassailable facts. You're going to make a great attorney. Listen, Uncle Max, I swear to God, I was working my ass off. I was trying so hard to do the right thing, but I got a little bit lost, and I asked this kid that was selling these maps for some help-- Hold it! Let me tell you... the next thing you knew. The next thing you knew, you're on a plane headed back to Milwaukee, working at some Jack In The Box trying to make your tuition. Look, son, You may be able to bullshit your parents, but I'm running a company here, not some Goddamn summer camp! Do you understand me? Yes, sir. [CHUCKLES] Sit down. Yes, sir. Oh, you're a good one, kid. You're a dandy. Why don't we just... start all over again, okay? This guy Barnes, huh? He's been giving us the slip for quite a while now. You just, uh... you take care of that one case, and we'll pretend that this whole ugly... affair never happened, okay? Okay. I'll take care of it first thing Monday morning, sir. Hold it. Not Monday. Now. Zachary Barnes? You're trying to evict Zack Barnes? Why didn't you say something to me? Why, you know this guy? Well, I don't know him, but he practically invented beach volleyball. He is the original king of the beach. If this guy's the king of the beach, why isn't he paying his rent? Huh? Well, I don't know. Is he over the hill? He's not over the hill. I mean, he practically beat half the guys on the tour. He was Rollo's first partner, taught Rollo everything he knows, then pulls a no-show at the classic a couple years ago. He dropped out completely. Rollo hates him for it, but if you really want to find this guy, stick with me. I know where he hangs out. ["ROAM" BY THE B-52s PLAYS] What do you think? I don't know.

Is Rollo around? Yeah. He's off getting a drink. Why don't you sit down. He'll be back soon. Okay. What I want-- Have you seen Zack Barnes? Oh, man. You're a funny guy, you know that? Listen, pal, you've repeatedly ignored requests from my firm to either vacate the premises or pay past rent due. Okay. You know what this is? What? It's a pay-or-quit notice. That means my client wants his money. Not only does he want his money, but he wants your ass out of there. The bottom line is you're an undesirable tenant. You're not much fun either. Hey, we got a problem here? Yeah, we got a problem, this guy doesn't pay his rent. You want money from me, take a number, stand in line. Zack, let me guess, car being repo'd? Rollo. Gambling debts? You're being evicted again. You know what? Rollo here. On me. Have a drink. Really, seriously, okay? Oh, eviction? Great. You know what I've always wondered, though?

We don't need this. - Relax. - You okay? Yeah. I'm okay. Get him out of here. Nothing damaged? Nothing important. Get my car. Bring it around. Good boy. Good boy. Let's go. You heard what she said. Go get the car. This isn't over, Zack! Get him out of here! Come on, man. Go get the car. All right, get him out of here. Kate... All right, everybody relax! What, is Rollo your new boy now? Huh? You disappoint me. Well, now you know how it feels. Are you all right? Hi. Yeah. I was, uh... I was just trying to get your attention. Well, it worked. Good. Well, what about that, uh, that drink at 2:00? All right. Okay. I'll see you then. It was a nice punch. Good night, Sam. See you tomorrow. [♪♪♪] Goodnight, Sam. See you tomorrow. Goodnight.

Well, I'm from Milwaukee. We don't have the ocean there, but we've got college. I've got a year to go till law school. Oh, no. What? Sleaze and stuff. Come on, I'm out here working for my uncle who's a lawyer. Oh, so you figured you'd come down to the beach and score with a cocktail waitress, huh? Exactly. I figured, you know, while I'm out there, I'll go down to the beach, I'll get lucky... All right. It's just that most of the guys down here are either burnouts, or... rich boys slumming. Oh, yeah? Rich boys slumming. Yeah. That's pretty gross. Yeah. So what do you do for fun? At 2:30 in the morning? Yeah. Well, generally after work, I tear off all my clothes... put on one of these and go for a swim. In the ocean? Yeah. Scuba diving in the middle of the night in the ocean? Yeah. You scared? Yeah. Yeah, that scares me. I don't do that. So I got an idea. Why don't you come with me to my friend's house? He's got a great pool. A friend of yours? Yeah. [CLEARS THROAT] Come on, trust me. Can I?

What are you doing, man? These guys are indoor players. What are you doing? You can't play a power game. What are we doing? Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Wiley, what's going on? It's just time out. This is our coach, okay? Is that all right? Good. Now, listen, listen. Wait. Come here. I'm not done. So you don't want to hit through the block, right? You can't hit through the block. You use the block. Aim for the elbows. Aim for the elbows, all right? Try that. Try that. We've got to play the smart game. - Who does this guy think he is? - Our coach. Thank you. Hit through the elbows, okay? Come on. Here we go, partner. Ricci Luyties and Steve Timmons continue to serve. Yours, yours, yours. Okay. It's on the net. Angle! Angle! Angle! Spike off the block of Ricci Luyties by Monroe Clark. Not bad. See, now, that's the idea. Now let's see if you can serve something besides legal papers, huh? All right, on the serve, all right, get the toss high and hit through the ball, don't hit at it, all right? Got it? Gotcha. All right. One more time. One more time. Here we go. Block! Get back. Go. Dude, dude, put it away! [CROWD CHEERING] Hit by Monroe Clark at the net and it went downtown, but it had some juice on it, It beat the defense of Timmons and Luyties. Point, Monroe Clark and Wiley Hunter. Come on, boys, get it together over there. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Timmons point in front of Wiley Hunter. Side out Timmons and Luyties. I got it. Get on that. Get on it. Get on it! Get back. Mine, mine, mine. And Timmons closes the book on Hunter and Clark. Timmons and Luyties advance into the next round. I thought we played pretty good. So when do we start? Hey, coach. Start what? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. Come here. You guys want to compete with the big boys, you need a coach. I don't get it. Well, your strategy's nonexistent, but at least your teamwork sucks. Oh, thanks a lot. It's true. So what do you think? I think there's a string attached. What's in it for you? For me? Yeah, what's in it for you? Well... for you to evict me, you need to file something with the judge, right? It's called a summons of complaint. Right. Well, you probably have a bunch of files around your office, and... What, you want me to lose the files? You just misplace it a little bit. Just until my investments pan out, you know? I can't promise you anything. All right, I'll see you tomorrow morning. I've got to work tomorrow morning. I start at 9:00. Who said anything about 9:00? Lay it down. Okay, Zack. Nice guy. Right here. Your umbrella. Thank you. Hey, hey, what are you doing? I'm getting the ball. Not yet. Down to the pier and back. Twice. Twice. Shut up. What are you doing? Down to the pier. All right, move it! This isn't a high school P.E. class. I've got 64 dead movie stars relying on me for survival, you know. Get a line! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? Monroe, why don't you listen? Why don't you listen? He can't call line while I'm in the air. Your partner says line, but you hit angle. Why? Well, I'm in the air and he's calling line-- Guess what? This is a two-man sport. Let me introduce you to your partner. Wiley, Monroe. - Hi, Monroe. - Great. Now, we've got two people on the court. Can we play with both of you, please? Hey, Zack! Call me a paramedic, will you? Once more around. Keep going. You're doing fine. And I'll set it. Get up! Get up! Oh, yeah! Such an incredible set! You're amazing. Okay, amazing grace, here we go. Ready? Yeah. There we go. All right, all right. Come on. Wiley, give me a set. Yeah, let the pro do it. Just watch, all right. Zack Barnes! - Oh! - Oh! Unbelievable! You've just got to bend your knees when you set. Come on, come on. Just pay attention. Bend your knees, Monroe. I am. I am. Relax your hands. You're too stiff. Hey, what are you doing? What's it look like we're doing, Rollo? You're not coaching these guys, are you? Yep. For what? The classic. - The classic? - The classic. Are you nuts? All right, let's try something else. Let's do a hitting drill. Wiley, you set, and Monroe, hit. Hey, these guys aren't gonna make it to the second round. You wouldn't care to make a little wager on that? What? A little bet. What do you think? Hey, unlike you, I like to work for my money. Hell, I'm not even sure we're not ready for you and Cross right now. Barnes, why don't you get real? Come on, come on, just a little bet. 4:00, Sunday, Manhattan Beach. What do you think? You got to be kidding. Look at these guys. Come on. Go, go, go, go! Come on, just a little bet. You've got a game. You've got a game. Great. See you later, boys. Great, great. Not if we see you first. Right, Wiley. Did you just do what I think you just did? We needed some incentive. I don't think that's the incentive we need, though. Not for you, for me. I need all the incentive I can get. Hey, how you doing, kid? Hey, Uncle Max. Listen, as long as I got you here, you remember that Barnes case? You know, that deadbeat living on the beach? Yeah. Well, a buddy and I are kind of in on this one together. You know, condos. The bum's sitting on a gold mine. Anyway, we lost the paperwork somehow. but I had Marie refile it for us, so I guess I'm gonna be able to see my nephew shine in court after all, huh? Well, that's great. Hey, remind me to talk to you about moving up to foreclosures, will you? You're looking good. [LAUGHS] Surprised? You're right so far. For you. Hey, I had to go through a lot of flea markets to find this-- Kate. Katie, I don't want to fight anymore, okay? I don't, either. Can I come in? I'm on my way out to coach a game. Let me buy you a quick drink. Please? Hey, guys, where's your coach? He'll be here. He's probably just doing something. You know. Don't hold your breath. You ready, partner? Yeah, I'm ready. Oh, remember? We got this at that garage sale. You said it was the world's ugliest lamp. I don't know, I think this one's uglier. It's really a lamp, huh? Mm-hm. I don't know. I think maybe the one in the bedroom's uglier. Is this going to be a night game or what? What's the deal, guys, you can't play without a coach? Give me a break. Let's do it. What about Zack? Screw him. Okay. Screw him. ["BUSHFIRE" BY THE B-52s PLAYS] ♪ On the horizon ♪ ♪ The landscape's burning red ♪ It's my fault. ♪ Smoke in your eyes ♪ ♪ Smoke in your eyes ♪ Go! Go! Nice try, Wiley!

Where were you? Uh... Kate, this is Monroe Clark. Monroe, this is Kate. Hello, Kate. Hi. Bye. You leaving? Yeah. I'll call you. All right. All right. Excuse me. Yeah. Sorry to break this up. I take it you lost. Yeah, we lost. You were supposed to be there. We needed a coach. Yeah, well, I didn't make it, all right? No, it's not all right. Wiley got hurt. What do you mean, Wiley got hurt? Oh, what, now you care? No, what happened? I'll tell you what happened. We didn't have enough money in our little deal, did we, Coach? Oh, that's great, man. The guy who goes around evicting people because they can't afford to pay their rent. And money's not important to you? First of all, that's my job. Therefore it's fine? Second of all, you're going to find out how important money is tomorrow in court! Court? What do you mean, court? Why don't you read your mail once in a while? If I were you, I'd buy a new suit. You all set with all this? Everything all right? Yeah. It's gonna be a slam dunk, Richard. Guaranteed, we'll have that lot cleared by Labor Day. All right? [BOTH LAUGHING] How many strokes you going to give me this afternoon? None, as usual. All rise. Court is now in session. The Honorable Judge McKibben presiding. You may be seated. Your testimony, then, is that this pay-or-quit notice was properly served. Yes, Your Honor, the second time. The second time? Yes, sir, the first attempt was unsuccessful. The defendant was not cooperative? Well, yes and no. Well, which is it? Well, sir, the first time I tried to notify him, he, uh, inhibited the delivery of process. How? By manipulating me into a confrontation with a bookie. A what? Your Honor, excuse me. My neph--uh, assistant Mr. Clark here, is new to these proceedings. If it please the court-- Yeah, it pleases the court just fine. Look, we have a full calendar this afternoon. I don't see any reason why Mr. Barnes' failure to pay his rent should take up any more of the court's time. Mr. Barnes, please rise. Mr. Barnes... is there anything you'd like to say in your own behalf? Um... No, Your Honor, the way I see it, money talks. That's it? Well, with all due respect, Your Honor, uh, it seems to me the issue here's money, not what I'm gonna say. Very well. Gentlemen, it is the decision of this court-- Uh, Your Honor, I have further pertinent evidence. Well, good for you, son. Sit down. Except that I was just about to rule in favor of the plaintiff. That means you guys. Yes, sir. I understand that. However, there are several elements that should be cleared up. Elements that are germane to the case. What is he doing? I have no idea. According to Sections 1161 through 1179 inclusive of the Civil Code, in a month-to-month rental, notice of increase cannot be less than 30 days. Yeah, I'm very well versed on the Civil Code, young man. Mr. Sidney, was sufficient notice given for the rent increase or not? It most certainly was, Your Honor. I beg to differ, sir. You see, defendant Barnes was given notice on February 1st of this year that on March 1st, his rent would be increased. That's 28 days, two days shy of the legal 30 required. Your Honor, this is a technicality, Your Honor-- As a consequence, the increase is not only invalid, but implies that the plaintiff's eviction attempts, according to section 1942.4 of the Civil Code, were retaliatory. I call the court's attention to the inflammatory language used in the notices sent to Mr. Barnes. Well, if the plaintiff wishes to refute... I want that over-age beach bum out of there. It's my property. I can do what I damn well please. I mean, within the law, Your Honor. Well, as I was about to say, the court rules in favor of... the defendant. [POUNDS GAVEL] Next case. I paid 250 an hour for this? Clark, you're fired. What the hell are you smiling at? Richard, just relax, will you? I can handle this whole thing, all right? Oh yeah? See if you can handle malpractice. Richard, will you just listen? Who do you think you are, huh? Wait till your father hears about this, huh? That Mercedes better be back in my office by noon, or you consider it a stolen car, and I want you out of my house by tonight. Look, kid... let me tell you something. I think you should forget about going to law school. You're not cut out for what I do. You're right, sir. I'd rather be a lawyer. Bailiff, call the next case. Next case, Finesman vs. Davis. So you gonna dribble that thing or spike it? Going home, huh? Well... Um, I didn't get to say thank you, and, uh... I didn't do it for you. No. I know that. You did it for yourself because it was the right thing, but that doesn't mean I can't say thank you, does it? Is that your dinner? Yeah. You want some? Maybe you don't know everything after all. Let's get you some decent food, huh? Come on. Soccer is not my sport, so I try basketball, right? Okay, here I am standing in this long line of guys who are... trying to do lay-ups. So I go running down four times trying to do a lay-up. I don't hit one of them so they cut me from the freshman team. That's the end of basketball. So what's left? Volleyball. So-- What's this shit, man? Oh, it's a recipe I got from an Indian chieftain in Hawaii about 10 years ago. He claimed it warded off evil spirits. Whoo! You got some tobasco in there, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Listen, uh... you were, uh... you were good... up there in court. I was impressed. Thanks. So, uh... you're going back to Milwaukee, huh? Well, I'm not exactly busting with options, am I? Too bad about the Classic, though. You were getting good. Well, pretty good, anyway. My partner's got a broken arm. So you need another partner. Yeah, where am I gonna get a new partner? You? Yeah. Why not? Eat up. What's wrong? Don't you like it? Seriously. You can crash here. You don't even have to pay rent. You don't pay rent. Details, all right? You want to do this or not, huh? Hmm? Listen, I just want you to be my partner. I don't want you to pick out silver patterns. Look, if you stick around here long enough, you get to know me, you're gonna realize I do a lot of shitty stuff, all right? So... what do you think? Okay. Okay. Okay. Tell you what... I'll even do the cooking. Oh, man, where's the airport? I got a plane to catch. I'm out of here, pal. [BOTH LAUGHING] The Duke, the Bogies, the Gables. All the kings are in here, and, uh, hey, look, the bigger stars seem to be buried towards the back of the cemetery, so I'd walk towards the back of the cemetery. Yeah, right back there. Uh-huh. And have a good time. Enjoy yourselves. Watch your hat. Okay. Nice hat. How's business? It's dead. That's pretty funny. No, I'm serious, man. A business like this kind of runs on a rhythm, you know? Oh, look, I found something for you. I got this-- this article on an actor. He tried to commit suicide He set himself on fire and jumped off the Hollywood sign. Is that what you came down here for? No. No. I came down here to apologize... for what happened. It's cool. Good. So, listen, I'm gonna play in the Classic with Zack. Well, good luck. You'll probably do pretty well. Well, listen, I'm telling you this because I'd like you to be around, you know? Yeah, well, I got some things happening, you know? Okay. I'll see you later, huh? All right. Hey, man. What? Grab that sign, will you? I invented you, man. I mean, you guys were nothing before me. I can't just let an investment go down the drain. You know, there's, like, media, TV. Okay, men. I'm your worst nightmare. Keep it up. We only got four weeks till this Classic, and you're not looking very classic. Very funny. Very funny, Monroe. 22. What? Yell out half of 22. Come on, give me the ball. Yell out half of 22? Whatever I yell, yell half of it. Ready? - For what? - Yell it. 14! - Seven! - That's it. What's it? It's just a little trick. It's a little trick to make you get connected to me and get your mind off the damn ball. Come on, pay attention. Here we go. Try it again. Listen. 10! 5! That's the idea. That's starting to work. It's about-- - Yelling numbers! No, it's just about teamwork, man. That's what you got to learn. That's the point. If one of us screws up, so does the other. All right. Here we go. - 24! - 12! That's it. - 42! - 21! That's it! 332! What are you talking about? I failed arithmetic. It worked, man. Hey, stranger. Hi! What have you been doing? Nothing. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Actually, I've never been better. I heard what you did for Zack. That took guts. Well, let's hope my folks see it that way. I guess the Mercedes is history. Yeah, the Mercedes is history. So's my job and my home. That fabulous pool. My life is basically history. Oh, no car, no job, no place to live? That's pretty pathetic. Well, actually, it sounds like my kind of guy. Really? That's your kind of guy? So should I kiss you on the lips? Do you mind? No, I don't. So how's Wiley? Wiley's good. I--I broke his other arm. [SAM LAUGHS] Set me! Oh! Oh... Serve the girl. Serve the girl. I got it. Game! Incredible. Oh, I'm going to stay here and die. Do you want something to drink? I'd rather have some CPR. Oh, I bet. How about some water? I'll take whatever I can get. Whatever happened to that basketball/volleyball stud? That guy's on vacation. Is he thirsty? It's possible. You were pretty good out there today. Oh, thank you.

Spalding tattoo. You guys are gonna wish you never came out here. You okay? Yeah, what are you talking about? Billy Cross back to serve. [♪♪♪] Let's go, partner. Here, cover the line. Cover the line here. Goddamn it! Oops. We could have a mismatch on our hands. Cross and Vincent, three, Barnes and Clark, zip. You okay? Yep. 3-0 here on the feature court. Billy Cross toes the line one more time. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Here we go, I got his line. Coming back here. Set me. Straight up. Hit that! Barnes can't pick it up. Gotcha! The serve is staying with Cross and Vincent. Focus! Come on! Let's go, partner. Serve 'em. You. I'm there. Go, go, go, go! It's out! Oh, come on! Looked good to me. Just inches out of bounds. Cross and Vincent take a commanding 5-0 lead. Time out! Time out called by Monroe Clark. Look at Zack. He's dying out there. What's the matter? This is a joke. No, he's just tired, man. That's bullshit. So Rollo Vincent and Billy Cross looking very good here-- Doing all right? Yep. Barnes and Clark, they are having their problems. They are arguing with each other. There is no communication, and they may be feeling the pressure of the defending world champions. Go, go! Billy! Billy! Another point for Vincent and Cross. Come on, guys! Come on! Dive, dive! [WHISTLE BLOWS] Yes! Come on, Z. Zack Barnes can only come up with sand. Vincent and Cross still hold the serve. 10, 22, 42, 50. You remember that bullshit, coach? Give me half. Zack, go. Get on that! Go, go! Oh, man. The fall-away shot for Zack Barnes just doesn't go. Vincent and Cross are starting to celebrate, folks. Ow! God... Billy, he's cramping. I knew he couldn't last. Okay, Z, walk it off, baby! Work it out! There is no doubt about it. Zack seems to be moving a step slower out there. After three matches, Father time could be catching up with him. Zack, I hope you bet on me this time. I don't bet on apes, Rollo. I bet on horses. We're back to action here in the championship. Rollo serving. Okay, partner, concentrate. Are you with me? Would you get off my back? That's you! Oh! Come on! I hope you're getting a lot of money, old man, because you're blowing it. Listen, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. My legs may be shot, and I may be a little bit tired, but I'm here to win, do you understand me? I'm here to win! Then show me. The defending champion, Rollo Vincent, back to serve. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Set it! Nobody! Nobody! Yes! Yes! Beautiful! All right, here we go! Get it? Welcome to the match. This way! Get back! Get back! Yes, you got it! What is this crap? Damn it! You can't do this to me. Forget it, he's just-- What do you think you're doing, Zack? He's just trying to get you upset. Let's go. It looks like it's working. Point number one up on the board. I got it. Stay back. Nobody! Zack Barnes buries one into the sand! Another point for Barnes and Clark! It looks like the spark is lit. That's it. Aah! Set me straight up there. You're on that. Go! [WHISTLE BLOWS] Touch! Off his fingertips. No touch, ref. No touch. There's no touch. It was off his hand! Back away. [WHISTLE BLOWS] It came off his fingertips! I don't believe this. Forget it. Let's go. He didn't even see it. I know. Forget it. Let's play. Stay in it. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Block that, come on. Here you go. Here we go. Straight up there. Get up! What is that? Didn't you see that? I saw it. I saw it. I saw it, all right? You're not gonna call that? I didn't see anything. He was holding me! Calm down. Calm down. Just let me take the next serve, all right? Let me take the next serve. It's all right. Forget it. Forget it! All right, Rollo! Rollo Vincent back to serve. Hit it back there. Go, go, go! A beautiful driving spike by Monroe Clark. Where did he learn that move in Milwaukee? Side out, Barnes and Clark. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Come on. Here we go. Watch him. Watch him, Billy. Go, go! All right, Z! All right, we're on a roll, now! Let's go, Milwaukee! Yes! Yeah! [BLOWS WHISTLE] Now, block it. Get it! Yes! Great! Yes! Yes! All right! We got a chance here. Now, come on. Stay in it. Ball. Let's go. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Oh! What an incredible rally, ladies and gentlemen! We are all tied-- 13-13. We are two points away from the championship. Zack Barnes going back to serve. Got any more tricks, old man? Just get up at the net. Let's do it. Two more! Your ball! Your ball! Your ball! Yeah! Yes. You called the ball! Damn it! All right! Here we go! Okay, old man. One more. Whatever it is, it better be quick. I can't move. Just one more day at the beach, Zack. Let's see it, baby. Right now. For me. It is now championship point for Barnes and Clark. Zack Barnes to serve. [WHISTLE BLOWS] Okay, 20. 10! Setting up, come on. Cut now! Cut now! Let's go. Get that! Get that! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! Let's go. Come on. Now, get it. Go, go, go! Hit this! Let's go, come on! Go! Look out! Look out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! $50,000 richer! An incredible feat! An unseeded team knocks out the top-seeded team of the Classic! Welcome back, Zack, and welcome to the up-and-coming youngster, Monroe Clark. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
