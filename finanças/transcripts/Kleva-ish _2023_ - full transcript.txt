Welcome back to your favourite station, Y. Today on the show, we're talking about urban legends. The notorious characters who are infamous legends in the neighbourhood. Tebza from Mamelodi, what's your story? Have you guys heard of Maleather? That man is a problem. I'm telling you. Maleather? Hush, listen up and let me tell you! I heard that Maleather escaped prison, using fish oil. No one saw him and the cops don't even know how he escaped. I heard he robbed three gas stations in one night... without any backup. If he was a rat, not even poison would kill him! Maleather! Thulani? Are you talking about Dube's son or that drunkard? Nope, I don't know him. Wow, T-Man. You're the main man! Listen up, everyone. No one can deny this man is a legend. Wow, bro. There's no way. Wow, bro. Come on, man. Where did you learn to spin the car like that? Burning the tyre like that? Guys! Mabopane! Community! Listen up, everyone. Mabopane belongs to us! Pule, this car's performance is not bad. 500 meters in an eastern direction, right? Time, 180 seconds. The velocity is 2.77 meters, my boy. This is not bad my man, this is not bad at all. T-Man, Velo what? Velo when? No, maths is going to make you go mad my friend! Maths will drive you insane. Remember what happened to Thiza? Forget about addicts. Let's burn some more rubber. - Yho, T-man - I need to go, man. - One more spin, T-Man. - No, I need to go now. One more, dude. Let's go now. Right, I forgot about your appointment. What time is it again? Three o'clock? Wow, T-Man. Wow, my friend. Let's go, T-man. Voila! What did you pack for lunch? Hey, family. Family. I'm ready. Wow. Yes, yes, that's my boy! Wow. You look good, dangerous and on point! And I'm going to support you by cooking delicious food. I'm going to make sure that when our Makoti arrives... she knows the Gumbi's are a great family. But she hasn't said yes yet. No, she'll definitely say yes. What do you mean? Oh my goodness. No way, man. What's up with you? Looking like a prophet? No way. That shirt makes you look like a staunch Jehova's witness. - You're just jealous... - No, actually... you're dressed like a forex scammer. You look like you're going to gamble with the old ladies. She's just jealous. She's just jealous. Don't listen to Buhle. Share the joke. What's so funny? Ignore him, Papa. All you need to know is that today is the day... Thulani asks Ipeleng to be his date to the Engineering Faculty Awards. He even has a promise ring. A ring? Let me see it. Ta da! A promise ring? I don't get it. I just see an “I owe you.” You see when we were growing up... a man would show his true intentions by buying a woman a five-step ring. That's when everyone would see that he means business. Urgh, dad, you're starting again. You're so old-school, dad. We're the new generation, the 2000s. Do you get me? And as the new generation, we don't want to pick up our dates with a taxi. So, may I please use your Mellow Yellow car to fetch my date? Can you see what I'm hanging around my neck? Why do I hang the keys around my neck? So, they can be close to your heart! Exactly. You're going to have to rely on the charm I gave you by your DNA. Charm? Don't forget, there are two guys coming today for their driving lessons. Yes, I've made plans for those people. - Then I'm going to see my girlfriend. - You go, boy! Mr Promise Ring, I'll see you later. Dude... are you seriously walking around carrying that thing? Yes, in broad daylight! Bruh, you are so brave. I would never! Even if it was Zodwa Wabantu who I was checking out, as she's checking me out... I would never buy a teddy bear for her, never! Yuck man. Isn't she like 50? And she is still going strong! Plus, she loves young boys like me! No way. I see you've got some goodies, so what's your plan? I want to surprise Ipeleng at her residence. By “surprise” you mean you're going to show up there unannounced? Yes. Then you're going to ask her to the Virgin Olympics awards? Yes. I was there last year. And? That place had so much sexual frustration. That's not true. A salt brand should have sponsored it. No. T-man, are you sure about this? I know Ipeleng and what she likes. She's my girl. She loves toys and chocolates. - Yeah? - You understand? She loves Rhythm City and ciders. All I'm hearing is, “Red flags, red flags, red flags.” Unlock the door! Don't annoy me. What kind of driving was that? Lady, are you deliberately trying to kill someone? Just say you can't teach people how to drive. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? You almost killed that old lady. Don't tell me about that old woman. She was in the middle of the road. The poor granny was on the pavement trying to sell fat cakes! If you could actually teach people how to drive, I wouldn't have failed! I want a refund! Excuse me. Lolo, what's going on here? Why is your shirt so wet? I'm quitting! I'm not going to risk my life with roughnecks like this girl! Listen here. If you're on a suicide mission, leave me out of it. How dare you call me a roughneck? I said I want my money back. You want your money back? I quit. Speak to Thulani. He's the owner's son. - Speak to who? - I quit! You quit? I actually want to speak to your boss. I'm not going to speak to boys who play with dolls like fools. Do you hear me? I'm leaving now, but I'll be back. You better have my money then or else you'll regret it. Don't bore me. - No, man. - Idiots, who play with dolls. Wow. This girl is a roughneck. Wow. So, you're just going to let her call you a fool? - I would never - It's her opinion, hold this. I'm just thinking about Ipeleng. - You're so in love, bro. - Just take the keys and do what I asked you earlier. - Don't worry about business. - Don't forget the most important... Leave the business stuff to me. You're the charmer boy. Do your thing. Go sweep her off her feet. Let's go, my man. Cool, let me go. Look, I'll bring the final touches. Okay. Go do your thing. Hey, did you see that man? You were... It's Bra Stupa. So, did you get your license? No, Bra Stupa. You know how it goes. I didn't get it. So, what are you doing in my car with no license? Huh? Tazz... how many times must I tell you, I don't want people driving my cars without a license? Bra Stupa, you know how stubborn she is. This thing is simple. If someone doesn't have a license, they can't drive. - That means no tournament. - No way. End of story. Get out of my car. Out! No, Bra Stupa. Why are you being so serious? Bra Stupa, why are you being like this? The truth is Tazz didn't do anything wrong. You know the tournament is around the corner... and I really needed to practice, why are you being like this? Didi... you know I like you. You're a great driver. - Yes. - Rules are rules. If you don't get a license, you can kiss the tournament goodbye. Bra Stupa, you can't be serious. Bra Stupa, please wait a minute. Bra Stupa. Bra Stupa, the truth is that I really need this gig. - You really need it? - Yes. If you really need it then make sure you get your license. Otherwise, do you see them? There are many drivers dying to replace you! - Bra Stupa, I beg you. - It's all up to you. Guys, I'm not lying. No way, man. You mean to tell me that Thulani is dating a hot girl? Yes, Thulani. I know that man wears glasses but he's got a hot girl. No way, man. In Thulani's dreams maybe! You guys don't believe me? You know what? Let's actually bet. Once! Let's go. Here's R50. Winner takes all? Winner takes all! Speaking of Pretoria and its urban legends... the TUT Annual Fresher's ball is happening soon. And word on the street is that it will be legendary. All roads lead to Mabopane. And trust me when I say this, you don't want to miss it. Shh... Thulani? Everybody! Everyone, can I have your attention? What are you doing, Thulani? Ipeleng Gertrude Selepe. - Please get up. - Wow. Look. With this ring... And then? Old man? What... What's going on? Sir, what are you doing with my girl? Oh, is this your girl? Uhm. Please, can you give me five minutes? Five? It better be five minutes. I have a lot of other first years who are dying to see me. No way, man! Listen... Ipeleng, who... What's going on? I've been trying to find the right time to tell you this... I don't think things are going to work between us. What are you saying to me? Look, Thulani. I love you, right? - You're so sweet. - Yes. What's the problem? I'm young. I need danger. I need some excitement in my life. You just don't have that. Is this the danger you want, that old man? No way. That's somebody's father. - Please. - I'm sorry. - Look... - I'm sorry. Look, give me a chance. I can change. You can't change. - I can change. - It's just who you are. You lock your doors when you drive around Ga-Rankuwa! But I only lock the doors because I was mugged three times and you were there. You're my witness. I'm begging you. I'm sorry, Thulani it's over. I'm also going to mature. You'll be fine, okay? Come on, when are you coming to twerk for me? I'm coming. - No, no, no. - I have to go. No, baby. At least take these things. I don't want them. Just go home! Just go home! Please. I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Take this. No, go home. No. Go home. Please. - Please take this. - Go home, Thulani. Please take this. Go home. Please take it. Please take it. First years don't normally twerk like you. - Bro - Come on, man. I need to go soon. He's on his way. There's the taxi. I'm sure it's the last one. Look. It's T-Man, I told you. T-Man! Come on, my friend. This guy didn't believe me. I told you, man. Dude, bring the future Mrs Gumbi. Bring her in. Let's go. You're laughing? She's here. Bring her in. Hey, bruh... The taxi is leaving. Where is Mrs Gumbi? Hey, bruh. - Get out of my way. - Bruh! - What did we say to you? Pay up now bro! - Wait a minute. - What happened, man? - Pay me so I can pay Majikijela his cash. Just wait, man. Come on, dude. - What about my money? - Just go! - Just go! - Sure. What's going on? - Do you think... - Shush. Do you think she's a slay queen? I don't know. We'll see. We'll see. - Surprise! - Surprise! Thulani, my child, what happened? What? I've been trying to speak to him. He's been locked in his room all week. Try and speak to him, please. Let me try and see. T-Man. I don't want to speak to you. Come on, man. It's been a week now. - Open up. - Please leave, man. Please go away, my guy. Look, I've got rainbow popcorn and flavoured ice blocks. They are even melting. Open the door, my man. You know it's been your favourite since Grade 1. Open the door. - Buhle - What? Thulani, please give your friend a chance. Is he opening? T-Man? Yeah, he's opening up. Should I try and speak to him? No, let me speak to him alone. Okay. What's up now? What happened my man? I'm a laughing stock, not only on campus... but also in the neighbourhood. - Like, everyone. - No, man. My boy, are you still hurting from that day? I have a plan. I've got two balaclavas. We can get two Cricket bats from your bathroom... and go give that guy the beating of a lifetime. Break his kneecaps. So you want us to both get beaten up? What do you mean, the both of us? Stop being a coward, man. That's exactly why she left me. She says I'm not dangerous enough for her. What do girls actually want? Who knows, man? I mean, I can take risks. You know that? You know I can be dangerous too. Let me not lie to you, my friend. You know what? You're in touch with your feelings. You're a common sense kind of guy. Do you understand? You sometimes need to reveal your wild side. Do you know what it's like? Look at this movie, for example. - Abafana Ababi? - Abafana Ababi. The guys are bad boys. If you were like one of these guys... I'm telling you, Ipeleng would have never left you. I'm telling you the truth. Anyway, since you're not eating the rainbow popcorn, let's go check on Hazel. Let's go, man. And stop crying. It's such a girly thing to do. Bruh. These things happen, my friend. I don't want to lie to you. Yes, I'll be okay, man. Check that out. Mandy Molema. Wow. T-Man... I'd punch my grandmother for a chance with that girl, Mandy. That's the boyfriend. Mandy, what the hell is wrong with you? What don't you understand? - You think you can dump me just like that? - I already did. I was doing you a favour. A favour? Actually, leave! It's gettting heated. Yho! He just got dumped! Wow. It's already trending. Boy, news travels fast. Here it is, look. I told you, it's trending news. He just got dumped. They broke up. Check out the hashtag, #MandyandDrewzaHappilyNeverAfter. - I told you - Shame man, I feel for him. - I told you. - It's so sad. I've been there, man. All he needs is Aspirin and water. It will help him. I know he has a headache right now. It helped me, I know. Really. Pule, I know that look. Come on, T-Man. - Tell me, what is it? - T-man. Boy, if you get a girl like Mandy, Ipeleng will come running back. She'll come asking for your love back in a flash. But I know Mandy, she likes... She likes thugs... she likes problematic guys. I'm not like that. Forget that, boy. That's where I come in. Do you understand? I'm going to teach you how to be stylish. Just look at me, boy. I'm the main man. I am the best dressed in the neighbourhood. Everyone knows I'm the man. My tongue is smooth. I'm going to teach you one or two things so that you become the main man. Ask anyone, around Mabopane. Everyone knows I'm the main man. Okay then, main man. Teach me your ways. So lesson number one my boy, right? - Yes? - Never give girls teddy bears. No. That's just cheesy. What, is it too soon? - No. - And then number two? Oh, lesson number two, my boy. Look at yourself first. Now, look at me. You are too clean, bro. You're too clean, man. You look like you're going to church. You even smell like strawberries. That's for women. That natural smell inspires you to be a gangster. If you want to be street smart, you need to bath less. Don't bath for two days. Don't bath, bro. What is it? We have Covid, my sister. We have Covid. - Come on, open the door. - No. Look, get some tattoos. Do you understand? You can also get a gold tooth. Make an impression like me. Then you walk like this. Hello. And then? I wish I could help you. And you answering your phone too quickly, is not on. No, no, no, no, it's not on. It makes you look desperate. You need to watch your phone ring and not pick it up. Do you understand? Don't worry. Here, we take safety very seriously. No, thank you very much. Great. I'm telling you. It works. - No. - Dude. This guy doesn't trust me. This guy doesn't trust me. A gangster lets their phone ring. Look. - Pule, 32 missed calls, boy? - What's my name? Here's your first student. Hello. No, no, no, not her. Take your stuff. What's wrong? I've changed. You will never change. No way. - No, Pule. - I'm the main man. Look, 29 of these are from me. They're old missed calls, Pule. - Actually... - Pule, you're such a liar. - Why are you being forward? - Pule, you're a liar. So, why are you being forward? Don't take him too seriously. That guy is on drugs. Bro, I'm not lying to you. Women like men who can dance, boy. Look at the likes of Dr Malinga and “Matenase Wa Di Yobisi.” - That guy did a silly dance, but women like him. - No, Pule. The likes of Chris Brown. Maybe we can start there. Women don't like men with knock knees like me. That's not a lie, bro. You could start by doing the Macarena dance. I know you. If you think you're funny, you're not. But, did you see... There she is. No, boy, leave her. Don't humiliate yourself again. You see? You see? Gosh. No, bro, look. Forget about it. Listen, boy. Let's go to lesson number four. - No. - Lesson number four works. No, no, no, no, no, no. Your lessons are not working. Huh? What do you mean, dude? Yeah. - Yeah. - No. - T-man. - No. - T-man, you're not ready. - I'm fine. - T-man. - Stand there and watch. Hell... Mandy. Can I talk to you for a minute? Who are you again? We are in the same Communication class. Oh, okay. And? Can I please... Do you mind being my date for the Engineering Faculty Awards? Really? Look, you're even shaking. So you're asking me... - Yes. - If I want to date you? To go to the awards... - Look, Mandy... - Look. Look at me. Do you see me? Yes. - Yes, I see you. - Now, look at yourself. Do you think someone like me... would date a two ply toilet paper like you? No. No, my boy. Oh my goodness, no. People will embarrass you. - Anyway, friend, bye. - T-man. Thank you. Don't worry, boy. She was just playing. Cool. She's just joking. T-man. T-man. Look. - Wow. - #2Ply. - #2Ply. - Two ply. #2Ply. Wow. I don't see anything funny there. Come on. You're also a 2ply. Come on, dude. Ipeleng and Mandy are right. I can't be a loser my whole life. Yesterday, I was on my way back from Block U... some boys robbed me and even took my shoes. T-man, what were you doing in Block U? Why would you go to Block U alone? I needed someone to teach me stuff. Someone who's feared by everyone. Someone dangerous. No, man, no. Hey, shove off. Where do you think you're going? The top dog is here. Gintsa, you swine. Sister. - Sister? Dimakatso wait... - Huh? You get here and bully other kids, right? You and your friends need to stand in a queue. - Where do you think this is? - What's the commotion? I'll slap you, okay? - Let's go see what's happening. - I'll slap you, okay? Don't annoy me. I wonder what's going on. I'll slap you, boy. Shut up! Bab'Gumbi, how are you? I've been meaning to come talk to you, Bab'Gumbi. No, I'm sorry. We can't help you. I'm serious, Bab'Gumbi. I'm begging you. I can't afford to take a risk with you. Your driving is so bad, baby girl. I'm in trouble as it is because of you. I'm sorry. I can't help you. Fine. Alright. Bye. What are you looking at? I'm not done with you. Get out of my way. Dude, what did I do wrong? No way. Yes. T-man. Thulani! Thulani! Hey. My sister! My sister! Shove off, don't touch me. What do you want? My sister. I can help you get your license. - You? - Yeah. Oh my goodness. How? I'm the best instructor here. Anyone and I mean anyone knows I can help them get their license. Dude, what do you want? Money? No, I just want to be like you. Boy, what's going on here? Actually, do you know her? - To be like me? - Yeah. How? You want to be a girl? No, I want to be... Dude, I don't know you, okay? Yes, I want to be street-smart. You're stuttering. Speak up, what is it? - I want to be street-smart. - Am I funny to you? No. - Am I a joke? - No. - Do you want to mock me? - No. And then? Nothing. I'm serious. I'm serious. This move reminds me of when she broke my friend's jaw. This girl is dangerous. No way. I have three weeks to pass that thing, understood? - Three weeks? - Yes. I can get you ready in two weeks. - Two weeks? - Two weeks. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. I'll get you everything you need. What do you think? Deal? Shove off. What deal? Handshakes are expensive. - You can't just shake my hand, okay? - Yes. My goodness. I feel sorry for him, okay? This one needs a real man, not some loser. She needs someone with a backbone. Listen, if I get there and fail, I'm going to kill you. - Yes. - I'll iron your face, okay? Yes. I'll burn the clutch plate. Not just the clutch plate, you included. Yes. Wake up early tomorrow morning because we're meeting here, understood? Okay. That's more like it. You're my boy. What's your name again? - Thulani. - It doesn't matter. We're in the streets. - Wake up early, okay? - Yes. T-man, Thulani. - Oh my word. - Thulani. T-man, are you okay? - I'm fine. - Oh my goodness. I saw her manhandling and slapping you. What's going on, dude? - No, no, no. - Okay, fine. I tried getting a few guys together so we can save you but they're scared of her. Tell them to leave it. I'm very fine. I found someone who can teach me to be street-smart. What? Let's go. - Let's get her, dude. - No, I'm fine. The first lesson, boy. When people see you in the streets, you need to look provocative, right? Get a Mohawk like Lionel Messi and Neymar. What's wrong with you? Thank you. Boy, tell me. Who are the members of TKZee? - Huh? - The members of TKZee. No, he has the right of way. What kind of driving is this? Did you bring that spray? I got it. Do you understand? Hold on to them. That's the style. I want people to lose it when they see you. You must look like a rooster. Your hair must be like this. Do you understand? Now, face forward. No, no, no, no. No way. - What is it? - No way. Let's see what we have here. Wow. If you don't follow these rules and instructions, you won't get your license. Come on, K53? You're giving me a K53? Do you know how many rules this book has? You want me to follow all of them? This? No way. Scotch? Another thing. - What? - You can't drive in flip-flops. No way, these are so fresh. This is to let some fresh air in. So people know I mean businesses when I drive. Scotch is making a comeback. Tell her, Pule. Pule? - Step on the brakes. - Hold on, man. - Step on the clutch and brakes. - Relax. Please, brake. I'm begging you. - Do you drink alcohol? - I don't drink. What do you mean? Take this, you do from today on. Let me open it for you. - I don't drink Chibuku. - You'll get used to it, boy. Drink up. - This man owes me money, hey? - Which one. This one. Mr Tladi! No. Relax, man. - You can't park here. - Shove off! He owes me. Mr Tladi. You see? Mr Tladi! What is it? Don't bore me. Hey! Spitters are quitters. Swallow, man. Swallow. Mr Tladi, I'm coming. Damn it! I know where you live. - No. - Let me do this. No. No, please. Impressive. What is a “Chipi?” “Chipi” is a beautiful girl who will never lose her beauty. All the guys want her. She's very beautiful. I want you to pull the handbrake, okay? Don't let it roll. Lower the handbrake. Nice. - Superstar. - Just like that. Superstar. What is “Lenyora?” “Lenyora” is a street-smart guy who everyone fears. - Yeah. - Someone like me. - You've been listening, my boy. - Yes. - You're good to go. - You know this. Hey. What's going on? We're worried about you, Thulani. What have I done now? - You've changed dude. - Yes. No. I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, Thulani. Listen to the way you speak these days. I mean, yesterday you called Mam'Sizakele “Sweetie.” She's a sweetie though. You see? You keep calling dad “Ta Ike.” Come on. That's not even my name. Sorry, dad. I think your behaviour was caused by your heartbreak. - Yes. - Yes. So, we think the best solution is for you to get into a new relationship. A brand new relationship permit? But with somebody on your level. Not the likes of, you know? - Yeah. - You trust me, right? - Yes, I trust you. - Yeah. Mam'Siza has something nice for you. Cover your eyes. I have a surprise for you. I have something nice for you. Wow. Alright. And, Ta-da. This is Precious. Precious this is our son, Thulani. You can call me Preshy. No way, Preshy. Papa, this is a nightmare. No, papa. She only looks good at night. No, no, no, no. This is a nightmare. - No way. - Thulani. Geez. That's it. - Bra Stupa? - Huh? What's going on here? I think I might have found your replacement. What do you mean? We already spoke. You said I had time. Do you have a license? Bra Stupa, I'm working on it. I'm learning how to drive. No way. I can't compromise my team by waiting for you. - Yes, but I'm still busy, Bra Stupa. - No. - Bra Stu... - That's what I call driving. - You see now? - Thank you, my brother. Thank you. Skhokho! Well, I smell good. Check. - Check. - That's my boy. - Yeah. - Hey? - You know me. - Is this really you? - You know me. - Is this Thulz? - Yes? - That's my main man. Look, they say life is texture. You're beating us all. Hey? - You know this. - What's happening, boy? - Nothing much, you? - I want to ask you something. - Go ahead. - What's happening with you? What's happening? Yes, I mean, you're the full package. Everything is perfect. Why do you want to be a roughneck? - When you're like me, right? - Yes? You need to try something different. Don't stick to one thing. Life is short. So, you have to try. Be a hustler. You must think I was born yesterday. - What do you mean? - Men change for two reasons. First, it's money, and you don't look like you need it. The second is a woman. So tell me, what's her name? Let's buy. - Let's go buy. - Sure. - You're just... - How are you? - How are you? - I'm fine. What's up? Ipeleng, you know? Ipeleng? Come on, dude. You're speaking to Dimakatso. Did you forget my name? I mean the girl's name. It's Ipeleng. Oh. What, is she your girlfriend or something? Are you dating? We dated for six years. - Imagine her dumping me. - Six years? She said I wasn't dangerous or tough. Wow. So, I figured that the only way I can get her back is by being tough... because I wanted us to live happily ever after. Like my parents, they were very young when they met. They grew up together, dated and finally got married. But you were also practically married. Sorry, my boy. Otherwise, what's your story? - My story? - Yes. What do you mean? Your story. Tell me your story. - The story of my life? - Yes. Gosh. What do you want to know? What should I say? Tell me everything. Okay. My dad was never around, you know? He abandoned us. My mother died when I was young. She left me with my siblings. I... I was raised by my grandmother. All I really want is to take care of my family. Wow, hey. - You made me feel so stupid. - Why? You're doing all these selfless things for your family. You're doing them for... I'm doing this for a girl. Come on, dude. You seem like a nerdy guy. What do you mean? You're not a thug. We live by a code in these streets. What do you know about the code? You know I can spin cars too, right? What do you spin? The periodic table? - I spin cars. - MC squared. Come on, dude. Real thugs have beautiful women, not the likes of Ipeleng. They want girls with names like “Dorah, Morongwa and Matlakala.” Do you understand? The Paulinas and Rosinas of this world. Come on, dude. You must be joking. You haven't seen nothing. - But tell me here. - Yes, what's up? So, what are you going to do after getting your license? Wow. Wow, dude. You see, after I get my license... there's a competition called Spina-la Gusheshe. That trophy will be staring me in the eye. But I can't enter it without a license. That's where you come in. I need you to help me. Does it have a big cash prize? Of course, it's big prize money. What do you mean? But, never mind the money, dude. If I can just get a license. Do you understand what that means? It means I can get a job, boy. Just an odd job. Next thing you know, I'm picking people up from the airport. Next thing you call to ask where I am. I say I'm on my way. I start the car and... Do you understand me, though? Come on, dude. - Is it fine here? - Drive further. - Go forward. - No it's fine here. Naledi and Nakedi. - Here you go. - Thank you so much. - Are you fine? - We're so grateful. You did very well. - Did you stay well? - Yes, we did, my child. No problem. Why are you just standing there? Come in. Let's sit down. Let me help you, my children. Give those here. - Wow. - Your fingers must also... - Wow. - What's up, Pule? - Is this Thulani? - The one and only. In the flesh. Yes. Yes. Keep it there. I think we need to give him a new name. I think Pule has a great point. To your right. Right. Right. Perfect. What kind of name? - “Ghabhadiya.” - Hell no. - “Ghamsta.” - No way. No? One more time. Yes. Yes. Okay, how about... Spit it out. Yes. Maleather! Maleather? No. Yes. Maleather already exists. He's out there somewhere and his name is well-known. So, you can't just come and use his name. I've never seen Maleather with my own eyes. People just claim there's Maleather, but nobody has seen him. I think that name could work. You're right. Dims, come on. Don't tell me you believe those stories. You want to tell me that one man can pull off all those stunts by himself? It's impossible. Yes. Yes. Impressive. You nailed it. I won't even lie, shame. Did you see how I... Yeah. Two more lessons then you'll be ready to test. Sure. But I'm impressed. Let's go. Don't touch me. What's wrong with you? Do you think you will pass? Me? I'm going to pass. What do you think will stop me? What do you think? You still have a long way to go. What else is there to learn? I haven't taught you how to take care of a girl. A girl deserves French kisses from a true Casanova. Give her dimples on her cheeks, you know? - Take her to nice places, you know? - Yes. - Do you know what “Leroma” is? - No. - What about “Lamza?” - Yes. Okay. Let me show you then. Yes, we're done. You clearly don't need any more lessons there. The only thing missing now is... a nice car for her to ride in. Do you understand? A car to charm her nicely. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. Don't smile too hard, boy. Let's see what you've learned today. What's a “Lamza” my boy? It's a deep kiss. And what's “Leroma” my boy? It's a deep kiss. And how do you treat a woman, my boy? - You hold her by the ears, like this. - You get it. Wow. Wow. Boy, you look different. I know. It's the game, dad. Can't you tell? But your game is making you skinny, man. You don't eat well anymore, you know, Thulani? You don't understand the memo. - Oh? - This is the look I'm going for, you know? Chiselled and tall, Ma. - Okay. - Actually, before I go. Please borrow me Mellow Yellow. There's a braai today. You see this key, right? - Yeah. - I'll lend this to a mature man. Someone whom I know my Mellow Yellow will be in safe hands with. I don't care, dad. Drip is forever. Wow. - Hey, T-man. - Sure, boy. So, did you organise what we spoke about? Gosh. My dad said no. Come on, How, dude? Dude, we said you needed to make a grand entrance, right? I'll make a grand entrance. How? Don't tell me about those driving school cars. We can't take that to a party. I'm going to make a grand entrance. I'll do it with Mellow Yellow, you'll see. Mellow Yellow? You just said your dad said no. - Bro, my dad doesn't have to know. - Huh? Are you saying that? Am I hearing you right? Wow, T-man, you've changed. That's my boy. That's my boy. Mission accomplished. - Mission accomplished. - The door. Boy, from now on call me Roughneck Thulani. - The general himself - General, boy. Look, let's put on Y-FM and set the mood. - Put Y-FM on while I start the car, boy. - Let's go. 99.2. - Wow, General. - Himself. - You see now? - Sure, boy. This is what we call “The Moment of Truth.” - Boy. - Do you understand? You've made your grand entrance. I want to show you what I'm made of. I'm going to use this moment. - It's about to go down. - That's my boy. Let me show you. - Let's show these people. - Let me show you, boy. Show them, boy. - You know me, boy. - We've arrived. - We are here. - You know me, boy. You know, boy. Check this out. Check this out. - Boy. - Yeah. Boy, look at all the girls. Look at all the girls. Burn those tyres. Let's go, my boy. Wow, my boy! Ladies, come here. We just want the ladies, my boy. - Maleather. - Sweetie, look. Maleather! Come and take pictures with me. Hey. Why didn't you tell me you were Maleather? You know I don't like attention. I don't like the paparazzi. Oh my goodness. Look. I'm so sorry for the way I treated you the other day. I understand why you didn't say anything. I get it. I get it. Do you know what I'm saying? I'm so sorry. I'm so... Oh. That's a deep kiss. Guys, I told you. Here's the man of the moment. This is him, Maleather! Maleather, Maleather, Maleather. Maleather, Maleather, Maleather. Maleather, Maleather, Maleather. Maleather, Maleather, Maleather. - Gents. - Hello. Sure, gents. You see, Maleather? They say he walked out of the mall pushing a trolley full of cash. One man. He did it without backup. At all? That's why I said he's the best. I heard he is now in hiding, in Mamelodi. I'm sure he's chopping that money wherever he is. He's spending the money. It must be party after party with beautiful girls. It's going down. He's a top dog, that one. That's Maleather for you. Maleather, Maleather, Maleather. Maleather, Maleather, Maleather. Maleather, Maleather, Maleather. Do you see that this little boy is messing up my name out here? Makhubela? Please find me that boy. So he doesn't do it again. If he does it again, he's an enemy. - Yes? - Yes. - It's good, right? - Yes. - Right? - Very. Thulani, I've been looking for you. He's not Thulani, no. Baby, please tell him you're Maleather. - Right? - Yeah. So, please respect my man and yourself. Bye, Fi. You're not doing this for me. You're doing it for you. You know what? No, I'm tall. Geez. - Wow. - And then? What is it, boy? - Don't you know where to look? - Sorry. - I'll slap you. - Sorry. Do you hear me? Come! Yes, take this one. Take this one. Keep it up! Let's go, team. Let's go, let's go. Let's get them. Vuma! Shove off. Get out of here. Damn it. Baby, who is it? It's no one, baby. Don't worry. - Just hold me by the ears. - I should hold you by the ears? - Like this? - Come here, baby. My boy, wake up! Hey, you. - Wake up. - Come on. - Get out of the car. - Come on. Look. - Is this what I think it is. - Look. Look, my boy. Look at this. You passed! You passed! What's gotten into you, Gumbi? You're dodging classes. You come home drunk. Next thing you steal my car. What? Dad, why would I steal your precious car? You said I'm not man enough to drive it. So I'll show you that I'm a real man. - Come on, man. - Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? - I knew you could do it. - I left my phone in the car. Let me... One time? The person you are trying to reach is not available... I mean, wow. Huh? Yes. No, man. Maybe he's held up somewhere, you know? Maybe he's busy. You know he would be here otherwise. Pule, I'm not a child. Don't treat me like a fool. Only on Y. It's going down tonight at the biggest party of the season. The TUT Fresher's Ball in Mabopane. Brace yourself for a night of surprises where boys will definitely become men. Thulani, can I please talk to you. Aus'Pinky, if you want to talk to my man, You can do it in front of me. Pink leather? Anyway. Thulani, please, five minutes? But you heard her. Sorry. Thulani. You know your desperation is pathetic. Now please, can you let us pass? You hold on, little girl. He was my man first. - Really? - Yes. He is my man now. So, please step aside. I'll get him back. Gents. And now? Who are you here for? Don't touch me, you're making me dirty. What's going on? Let me go. Guys, I'm here with Maleather. Guys. Thulani! T-man. Dude, talk to these guys. They won't let me in. T-man! - You see? - Let him in. Look at what you're touching. Come on. Baby, what is he doing here? - He's here. - Why? Here he comes. He's here. My brother. Sure. Why did it seem like you were ignoring me? - But dude, why did you... - You can't sit with us, hey? - He's late with his three-quarter pants. - You see? No, this place is for VIPs. Only the two of us can sit in here. So, I don't know. Go sit in a corner somewhere. - Bro? - Baby, look at me. I want something to drink. - To drink? - Yes. - Something like what? - Let's have some shots. - Shots? - Shots. Shots on my man. Yeah. This is the one, right? Naledi and Nakedi. Come check my look. Wait, were you planning to go to the ball dressed like that? Yeah, what's wrong? Why are you acting like it's a big deal? But it is because you have to look the part. Yeah, but you know I don't have clothes. Why are you doing this? What is it? - Have a seat. - Okay. Yeah. Let's get started. - Sure, bro. - Hello. We good? Yeah, we're good. Why? Look, Maleather. I just don't like the way you treat me when you're with Mandy. Relax. What are you on about? Dude, that's not a big deal. Huh? - It's fine. - Come on. Just have fun. When last did you talk to Dimakatso? I don't know anything about her. I don't know. Why? Did you hear that she got her license? Well, that's her problem. It's none of my business. Good for her. She likes you. I was talking to her. I can tell she likes you. - She likes you. - Dude, look. You see the way I am now? This person I've become... as Thulani or Maleather, I would never date that girl. That girl is a roughneck. She's crazy. Do you want her to lose it on me? She's not my type. Is this really you “Dimakatso Wa Di Miracles?” - Oh my goodness. - Sure. Wow. You look so hot. - Shove off! - Dimakatso. Dimakatso, come on. Dimakatso, everything I said there... Listen. What about them? - Did you think I didn't hear you? - That's not what I meant. Everything you said about me? Listen here, Thulani. Final lesson, never test a roughneck, okay? We'll destroy you, my boy. Lastly, I may be a roughneck, but at least I know myself. I'm happy with what I see in the mirror. What about you? You're empty, Thulani. Do you hear me? Shove off! Shove off. Don't call me. - But... - Don't! Dima! - Dee. - Baby, baby. Leatheray. Baby, give me some attention. So, the photographer is here. - Baby, look. - Yeah. - He's here. - Yeah? You know we're the “IT” couple, so we have to take pictures. I also got us backstage access tickets to mingle with the artists. I mean, what's my name? - Mandy Mandz. - Look. - I heard you mention backstage access. - Gosh! I only have two tickets! Gosh, I'm sorry, but I'm sure you're used to it. - Anyway, Leatheray. - Yes? Baby, let's go. Yes, my love. What did you want to tell me? Maleather, my boss. The main man is here. The man in charge of the streets. Maleather? Are you good, my man? Ntuthwane, I hate that it's come to this. It's really bad. What do you want me to do for you, boss? Talk to me. Makhabela, let's go. Let's go. Yes! Mr Untouchable. The street government. The crazy gusheshe spinner. The man who commits crimes that bring helicopters out. - Maleather. - Yes! Hello, beloved. Greet him back. What's wrong with you. Excuse me, I'm not occasional when it comes to things like bright, dim, and having fun. But I felt really forced today. I can see most of you are still scared and surprised. But don't be scared. We know everything has a place and time. Today is your chance to get to know me better. There's a flea here. The flea is useless. This flea goes everywhere telling people... that he's Maleather. Who is it? I want that flea to come out right now and face me head-on. You heard what he said, right? I said the flea needs to come out now! Makhabela, get him. Where's that bastard? Hey, shove off! Why are you so quiet? - Why are you swearing at me? - I'm sorry. Take your clothes off. - No. - Shove off! - It's not me. - Take these shoes off. No, no, no, no. - Shove off! - I'm going to hurt you. I'm sorry, gents. Oh my goodness. Mama! You're making noise. Leave him to me. Sorry. Are you the dog who has the audacity to go around telling people you're Maleather? - It wasn't me. - I'm going to teach you a lesson today. If you never drank sour milk, I'm going to teach you. Take this. Yes, you bastard! Hey, you bastard. Take this off. I'm sorry, gents. Oh my goodness. - Sorry. - You're even wearing chains. Listen, my name is Elias Masotla. I'm a R200 Kota with all fillings. The atchaar has been replaced with yoghurt. I'm a die-hard. I'm the wrong one to mess with. Take his pants, Makhabela. - Take them. - Strip! - Don't annoy us. - Sorry. Take off your pants, damn it! Let this be a lesson to all of you. There can't be two bulls in one kraal. One must die. Shove off! We scored big time. Nice jewellery. I'm a master at this. Bro? Stand up, dude. Let's go home. Close your eyes! I'm sorry, the number you are trying to reach is not available... try your call again later. Sure, Dima. Look, I just told Thulani to go home now. The real Maleather was here. He beat him up. The guy also broke Mellow Yellow. Yes, I wanted to tell you I couldn't take him home because... the guy has changed. He doesn't even acknowledge me so there's nothing I can do about that. Yeah. But call me when you get this message. Bye. Thulani, what you did was nonsense. Irresponsible. You need to go open a case against this Maleather person. No, Papa. Papa, I am scared of him. He is dangerous. You put yourself in this mess... because you weren't the person you were supposed to be. Now you are going to need to choose to either be a principled person... or one who would let that criminal run amok and terrorise everyone. All because you're too afraid. Okay, Papa. I think Thulani heard you. Eish, Thulani. Papa, look. Pule. Go away. Come on, Pule. Please open. I want to talk to you. Come on, bro. Look, I know I don't deserve your forgiveness... but I want you to understand me, so let me apologise for how I treated you. Sorry, you were the only friend who was by my side even after I was humiliated. Plus, I brought your favourites. Pule. I've got your favourite snack. Huh? Look. I'm sorry, my friend. I said I was sorry. Huh? What do you want me to say? I should have let Maleather beat you some more. What? Even now, I could have been there. I would have been more humiliated if you had not helped me. You're lucky I felt like Superman that day. Maleather is so scary. Tell me about it. Now the police want me to go open a case. Imagine. And why don't you do it? I'm scared. Besides, I am glad to be “2ply Thulani” again. That's the only person I want to be. - 2Ply? - Yes. You treated me like trash. I heard that you and Ipeleng are now an item again. Thulz, you have a visitor. Yeah, she came to my house... An ear? And apologized and well... So, that's where we left off. Ipeleng came to you to apologise? Yes. I'm sure you were over the moon. I will just go with the flow and see how it goes. You? I know, eish and also this police thing... is also stressing me. I know I should go to the police station but I am scared to go there alone. Not a chance. Wow, hey? Look. Look, T-man, I can go with you if you want. Take off your glasses. - Maleather almost took your eye out. - Look at him, Sergeant. - He has big ears? - Yes. This is you. It is good as new, my friend. I told you it was clean. True. - It's as good as new. - You're right. How is it going here, guys? The engine is still intact and the booster still works. All is well. It's really good. Papa, I want to apologise again. Papa, I was wrong for everything I did. My son, let me tell you something. Yes Papa. It's fine. As long as you're back to your senses, I'm good. The only thing is, next time do me a favour by not losing yourself trying to impress girls. Never again, Papa. I promise. You're not the only one who makes mistakes. You see, when I was trying to get your mother, I was just like you. I tried impressing her with Mellow Yellow and other material things. But you know what? She didn't buy it. She made me wait like a traffic light. Do you know when she agreed to date me? When she realised I was being myself and not trying to be someone else. So, I want to give you a piece of advice. Always choose those that like you for who you are and not for what you have. - Do you understand? - Yes. We all make mistakes. That's life. You will be fine, okay? - Thank you. - Thank you, son. You guys will finish off. I'll see you later, okay? - Thank you, sir. - Sure. Wow. - Dude. - Sure? I couldn't help but listen in on your dad guiding you. Do you know what I love about your dad? He loves you. You can say that again. Tell me, bro. When last did you talk to... When last did you talk to Dimakatso? I am still blocked. Look, bro. Just be patient, okay? - Yes. - Be patient. You know, to tell you the truth... I thought you and Dimakatso would've made a great couple. You'll be the talk of town. But I see that you guys are not finding each other. And also, look over there. Your sister and your girlfriend get along very well. You are also crazy about her. She drives you crazy and she's the woman of your dreams. I am happy when you are happy. You know that, right? So, if Ipeleng makes you happy then I'm happy. It's fine. Yeah. Let's just finish off here. Yeah. Are we going? Let's go, I also want to buy ice. It's too hot. Let's go. There's this fool who's beginning to become a nuisance. As of today, I only have one mission. To find this imposter and teach them a lesson they will never forget. - Pick up for Ipeleng? - Yes, Ipeleng. Seatbelt. - Ready? - Ready! Cool. Yes, friend. Thulani is a loser, but he's a loser with a plan. With his brains he will probably be the next Elon Musk. I need to stay close by his side. Of course I'm still seeing Mzwandile. I will just make sure Thulani never finds out. Yeah. Thank you. One last thing. Can you wait until the awards are over? Why don't you request another ride? I will pay extra. Okay. Thank you. Cheers. Women. Thulzinator. My man. You are looking lovely today. I can even smell your Colombia. What do they call this suit? Just relax, Thulani. I've got your back. We're friends after all. Thulani, let me tell you something. I know that you thought I didn't know... that I know that you opened a case against me. No, no, it wasn't me. - You are a snitch. - I call this my happy place. You do not realise that a lot of sorrow can happen in such a place. There's only one thing that is stopping me from ending you here and now. It's this case you've opened against me. What did you accuse me of? According to you, I am a rabble-rouser in the community. No. I vandalise and commit public indecency. I am going to show you what public indecency is. Do you understand? I am going to teach you... What's going on? - Who do you think you are? - Shove off, I am not talking to you. Would you please shut up? Yes. Who do you think you are? Who are you? He's my friend. He's your friend? Thulani has a girlfriend. Tell me, your girlfriend is here to rescue you? Yes, and then? You are pushing me. Maybe you think you are scaring me with your township attitude. Listen here my love, you are nothing. Listen, the way I see it... real men live by a code. If you want to end this, you and I will have to see who's boss. What? Keep quiet as well. Let's meet at 10 pm. No more talking. At the stadium, let's spin for it. There have been many others before who have sung a similar song. They sang it better than you. - Okay? - Do you see the danger? Many others thought they could take me on and later regretted it. But because it is your wish, let me quickly help you. And show you how I got the name, Maleather. See you then, Dimakatso of miracles. Thulani. Yes? It's good to see you, my friend. Okay. - We will get you, Thulani. - Shut up. Shove off! Until we meet again, Dimakatso. We will teach you a lesson. Let's go, red velvet. Get in the car. We'll see you soon. - Shove off. - Who is this animal? - Relax. - Your mother! Don't tell me to relax. - Dima, can I please talk to you. - Please don't touch me. What must happen now is to show Maleather who you are. - Stop making noise. - No, that's not going to happen. Thulani, you are going to go to the police. They will deal with this issue, not this violence. And you... I thought you were a well-mannered driver. You like undermining people. What does a “well-mannered” driver look like? No. Baby, let's go and leave her here. You know what? I am not leaving. - What? - Yes. I am not going anywhere. - Must I tell him or are you going to? - Tell him what? - Should I tell him? - What? Must I tell him that you are a gold digger? You were telling your friend over the phone that Thulani is a fool. Don't listen to her, baby. - She is lying. - He is your retirement plan. Is this true? It's not true, baby. I like joking around. You don't play like that. Your jokes are not funny. I believed that you were the only one who could make me happy. I now realise that you're evil. Thulani, please think clearly about what you are saying. You are evil. She was busy talking about Elon Musk and Bill Gates. - You are her retirement plan. - Baby, I was joking. - She doesn't want to work. - She is a liar Girls like her are a disappointment to our mothers. Ipeleng, it's over. Yes. It's over between me and you. It's over? That's what I am saying. - You are leaving me, for this thing. - It's over. Yes. Okay, it's fine. But remember this. I was dating you as a favour. Did you hear that? I told you so. But... You are still a fool. Both of you. You can go. I don't have time for games, to tell you the truth. She's bringing me back to me. You must come to your senses, so that we can deal with Maleather. People are now disrespecting me because of you. Shove off! Congratulations, by the way. I smell fear. Please note the rules. Whoever touches the drum, loses. Do you understand? It sounds sexy when you say it. Let's see it on the field. You must go back to school. We'll be back. Let me put this on you. This is my fight. Trust me. Allow me to do this. - I hear you, but... - Please trust me. Do you trust me. Yes. Fuck, Fuck, Fuck. Your father's car is the one. Fuck. This boy is full of nonsense. Let me teach him a lesson. Hey you, fool. Hey, you bastard. Who do you think you are, you dog? Get down. Lay down! Get down. They're arresting him. They got him. They got him. This is awesome. I would like to apologise again for not being there and you've always been there for me. Please forgive me. You know that you've hurt me, right? Yes and it was never my intention to hurt you. I have now realized that I would really love for you… to be part of my future. Future? What are you talking about? Would you please be my girlfriend? What are you saying? I would love for you to be my girlfriend. Wow. Huh? I am not sure. Okay, but please close your eyes. Close my eyes? Just close your eyes. Trust me. Trust me. No one is going to mug me, right? No. Okay. So, what do you think? Alright, then. Fine, I will be your girlfriend. - Are you sure? - Yes. Thank you. So, what are you going to do? I was thinking... we could... Huh? Here? Let me show you. - Hello, ladies. - Slender. Thulani, 2Ply? Of course, I know him. Thulani helped the government to stop loadshedding in our township. I am telling you. I heard… Dimakatso spun circles around Lewis Hamilton. Whistles all around, it was lit. Don't mess around. It's a Teddy bear, my favourite. I'm seeing some sweets over there. Thulz. I'll find you there. Papa. You know that you've made me proud. You're becoming a young, fine man. Thank you, Pa. Honestly. Does that mean I can finally drive the Mellow Yellow? The way I trust you now, proudly so. - Wow. - This is your time, my boy. It's about time, my boy. Thank you. I never thought I will have such a hot girlfriend like you. I am surprised myself. A girl who can spin cars, “Miss everything.” I'm also surprised. I never thought a nerd like you can spin better than gangsters. Look at what that nerd can do now. But you are still a nerd. Wow. - It is nice to be a nerd. - I will teach you things. Let's go. Yeah. Come and open the door for me. You see? I am still teaching you something new. Yes. Don't be such a nerd. Wow, girl. Kiss me again.
