[footsteps echoing] [door buzzing] Warden. Warden. Bernadine. Everything is set. Good. Deputy Morgan will notify you when it's time. Okay. [whispering] [speaking Spanish] Mrs. Jimenez? Have you heard anything? Did they stop it? No. No. [crying] Okay. Come here, come here. Sit, sit. Look. Nothing will happen until we get clearance, okay? We haven't gotten clearance. We'll let you know. We'll let you know when it's time. [Mrs. Jimenez speaking Spanish] - [man] When do we want it? - [crowd] Here and now. - What do we want? - Respect for life. - When do we want it? - Here and now. - What do we want? - Respect for life! - When do we want it? - Here and now. - What do we want? - Respect for life! - When do we want it? - Here and now. - What do we want? - Respect for life! - When do we want it? - Here and now. [chanting continues, faint] [clock ticking] [knocking on door] Bernadine? We heard back from the director's office. Thank you, Deputy. [sighing] [ticking] [breathing shakily] Down. Down. [machine beeping] [steady beeping] [door closes] [beeping faster] [beeping slower] I can try his foot. [man sobbing] [speaking Spanish] [groaning] [beeping faster] We can try his femoral vein. Get going. Do it. I'm here, Victor. [speaking Spanish] Blessed is thy fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of my death. [speaking Spanish] [screaming] [crying] Mr. Jimenez, can I get you anything? Do you have a final statement? [sobbing] [beeping slower] Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation. [speaking Spanish] [beeping slower] [slow beeping] [clock ticking] [gagging] [rapid beeping] [sobbing] Do something. - What is happening? - [gasping] - [medic] I... - Did you put enough in him? His heart was just slowing down. I don't know why it didn't stop. He should be unconscious. [Victor gasping] [medic] His vein's infiltrated. Find another vein. - Do you have more drugs? - [medic] Uh, I don't know. Get the director on the phone. - [gasping] - [machine beeping] [machine flatlining] [medic] Warden, he's dead. Are you sure? [medic] Yes. Do you wanna get the doctor in here to confirm? Warden? Yes. Get the doctor. We call his death, 10:47 p.m. [buzzer sounds] Well, we got a couple more requests from two reporters. They're local. They just wanna come in and maybe talk with you for a few minutes. But I know you're busy. Maybe they can talk to you or somebody else... Monica is in charge of all media requests. I know, but she's been telling people no because that's what you've been telling her to say. Sonia, I do not want any media in this prison. Okay. Well, that lawyer from Legal Action Now wants to bring one or two people in to visit Woods. They think he might get his appeal decision today. Are they representing him now? [Sonia] I don't think so. I guess they just wanna see him. They faxed their paperwork in last night. Then they need to make sure they're on his visitation list. - Make sure nobody comes in with him. - Mm-hmm. They're always trying to bring people in to visit the inmates. Okay. [man] Anything else, Sonia? [Sonia] No. You know, Woods' mom's funeral is today. I know. Block out a full hour for the executive staff meet today. We'll be done by 2:00. Okay. [beeping] Mr. Hugger. Mr. Martinez. - [man] Good morning. - Yeah, good. [gate clicking] [handcuffs clicking] Woods, you're up. [handcuffs clicking] Open 32. [woman on radio] Copy that. [buzzer sounds] [man] Woods, you can't put all these up. [buzzer sounds] Mr. Johnson. - Mr. Brooks. - [Brooks] Warden. Mr. Woods. If you want to phone someone after your mother's funeral, I will allow that. You're set. - [buzzer sounds] - [gate clicks] [man groaning] Oh, jeez. Oh. I'm sorry. [Bernadine] Okay. [sighs] Move your foot. [man on TV] ...seem dark even when the sun is shining. When you're in bed, the pitch black of your room can offer more comfort than a loved one's embrace. When you feel that your soul is tired even in the happiest of moments. If you've struggled with depression before, if you tried other medications... [man] Bernadine. Is it too loud? No. You have to go to work in four hours. So do you. I know. I'm fine. Well, I wanna share a bed with my wife. Now, Bernadine, how long is this gonna be going on? [Bernadine] I don't know. Go to bed. Go on. Please? Go. [buzzer sounds] [ball thuds] [birds chirping] [men chattering] [man] Man, I don't know who's worse about those damn birds, him or Woods. They're both strange fuckers. Do you think they're gonna go through with it this time? We'll know any day now. I hear the attorney general might recommend an investigation into what happened with Jimenez. Is that true? If there is a review, I will make sure that it happens internally. Well, we handled everything by the book. You know that, right? Nobody was gonna find a working vein. Jimenez didn't drink any water that day. Why didn't he? I'm reviewing protocol with the director next week. I'll give you any updates. It's a group of lawyers. How much trouble could they possibly cause? They just wanna talk to the guy. Hey, they're not on his visitation list, and they're not a part of his legal team. If they wanna talk to him, they can write him a letter, call him on the phone. Those are the rules. He's not gonna do that. You know that. He's numb, he's... he's cut people out, people have cut him out now. [sighing] Now his mom is dead. I just want him to know that there are people out there that support him. He didn't get his appeal, did he? It's just a conversation. Marty, no, I can't. You know, for the past seven years, you've blocked every single attempt I've made to try to get him to be treated like a human being. You're gonna kill him. Isn't that enough? I have treated him like a human being every step of the way. It's not my job to bypass the rules to accommodate your special request. Special request. How is it a special request? Open the gates, please. I'd like to leave now. - That's a special request? - I have to maintain order and safety in this prison. I got over a thousand bodies that I have to ensure are safe and accounted for. It's hard enough without you complicating things. What you have to do is protect yourself now that this place is under fire since you botched the last execution. - Get out of my office. - Put up the barricades, keep the outside world out so you can kill him as under the radar as possible. - Get out. - And remove any dignity the man has left to boot. - Go. - Yeah, I'm going, but I'm not going far. Just so you know, I am going to fight for him right up until the very moment you stick that needle in his arm. Just so you know. [door slams] [sighing] [door opens] Anthony. [Anthony] It's good to see you, man. Now, you promised me you was gonna eat some potatoes. You look a lot skinnier than the last time I saw you. Yeah? Potatoes, huh? Uh, I tried. I forgot. I'm a little busy. [chuckling] How are you holding up? Uh, you know, it is what it is. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey, man, I wanted to apologize for not coming to see you last week. - It was just, my mama had passed and... - I get it. You know what, I just... I didn't wanna see anybody that day. I get it. I understand. Yeah, but you drove all that way, you know. No worries. All right. So what's going on, Marty? Tell me. You got some news? Uh-huh. You're gonna be my last client, Anthony. I'm retiring. What... What happened? What happened? I don't know. I've been doing this for 30 years, that's what happened. For five years you've been telling me they'd have to carry you out before you leave Legal Action Now. Yeah, lawyer humor. Look, I know you got to do what you got to do, Marty, but you're the first lawyer I've ever had that's made me feel like I actually got a shot at this. I think it's time the kids took over. Uh, I had a baby lawyer today teach me how to do a press conference on Snapchat. It's time to see what they can do. I don't believe you. [country music playing] [pool balls clacking] You have some catching up to do. - [chuckles] - All right. - Hey. - Hey. What you got there? Ah, libations. - And how are you? - Oh, I'm great. I mean, now that I'm here. You know, Director said Mrs. Jimenez wants to handle all the arrangements for burial. Mm-hmm. - [waitress] Here you go. - Thanks. She... Thank you. She doesn't want the state doing jack shit. And I can understand that. But I am pretty sure she has no money. - Bernadine. - What? [sighing] We're not at the prison anymore. We're here. [sighing] You're right, we're here. Yeah. So, how's your... how's your children? - [chuckles] - How many kids do you have? [chuckles] My God. You suck at conversation. Officer. Officer. - Hey, hey. - Thomas. - Give me those keys. - No. - No, hey. - You dropped my purse. You made me drop it. No keys for you. Bernadine. - No. - No way, no way. Thomas, I'm fine. [chuckles] I'm the warden and I'm fine. Come here. You're not driving. - No. - Yes. - You give me those keys. - Don't do that to me. Don't do that to me, because I'm fine. You give me those keys or I'm gonna start dancing. Oh, hell. [laughing] Get in there. I am the warden. Yeah, you are. I do a damn good job. I do a goddamn good job. Yeah, you do. That's all I'm saying. All right, come on. I'll take you home. And Jonathan can drop you back here for your car in the morning, okay? [car signal ticking] [man on TV] By late Monday, the blaze threatened more than 108 structures. Bradley Ross, a heavy fire equipment operator, was seriously injured battling the fire when the bulldozer he was operating rolled over. Ross was rushed to Highland General and is expected to make a fast recovery. We now go over to Pam Dawson in our newsroom with a special update. Pam? [Pam] The final appeal for the man convicted of killing Officer Robert Collins 15 years ago was denied this evening. Anthony Woods has been on death row for the shooting of Officer Collins and will now await a death warrant from the state. Mr. Woods' legal team is expected to fight for a reprieve to prevent his forthcoming execution. Ultimately, the governor has the power to grant Mr. Woods clemency, even moments before his execution. [gasping] - Hey. - [panting] Hey, baby, what's wrong? Come on, talk to me, huh? What's wrong? Tell me. Huh? I'm okay. I'm okay. You sure? Yeah. I can't sleep. Mm-hmm. I can't go to sleep. You all right? Yeah. All right. Yeah. I'll do it again. You sure? Yeah. [Bernadine] You're under no obligation... No, it's fine. I'll do it. We're getting a different medical person though, right? Yes. And the director will be there this time. Okay. Deputy Morgan will also be there to, um, support and assist when necessary. Thomas, we're gonna need another volunteer for a rehearsal. Bring some officers around this afternoon to speak with me. I'll do it. - Thank you. - No, I mean, I'll do it. The guys can practice strapping me in. That's not your job. It won't be a problem. They just strap me up and take me down, right? Okay. I'll put you down. [Bernadine] Four hours from the execution, all communication with outside parties will cease. That includes Mr. Lumetta, friends, family members, but you can be with the chaplain the entire day, all the way through the procedure. You will have to take your clothes off, wear the shirt, the pants, the shoes issued to you. When it's time for the procedure, you will be walked to the chamber where five officers will restrain you to the gurney. A medical professional will prepare you for your injection. Officer will insert the midazolam. That will render you unconscious. The second drug is pancuronium bromide, which causes paralyzation. The last drug is potassium chloride, which will cease heart function. At that point, medical personnel will confirm the execution complete. Now, if you wanna talk to Mr. Lumetta about this, later you can, but do you have any questions? Do you have any family that would like to claim your body? If there are no family members that wish to claim your body, your remains will be laid to rest in a plot here on our property owned by the state. Mr. Woods, you have the option of selecting your witnesses. It's good to have one or two people who you know by your side. Maybe your lawyers. [inhales] [exhales] No? Okay. Okay. [buzzer sounds] [people chanting, faint] [sobbing quietly] [grunting] [grunting] [officer] Woods, you all right there? [groaning] - [man] Hey, what's going on? - [officer] Need backup. [woman on radio] Coming your way now. - [grunting] - [door buzzing] [man] Man, watch out. They coming. The guard's coming. [officer] Open, 32. [man over radio] Roger. [grunting] Calm down. - [prisoner] Leave my boy alone! He ain't done nothin'! - [officer] Hey, hey. Get off me! Let me die! Let go! Let me die! Calm down! Get control of yourself! [officer] We have a medical signal three. We need backup. No more appeals! Fuck it. I did it. Kill me! Kill me! I said what I done! I said what I done! Let me go! [machine beeping] [man singing: pop] Officers. [clears throat] Dan. Hi there. Get my guys there, I'll take a Johnny Black. And Marty. Thanks for telling me. How's he doing? He's gonna be okay. You'll be able to see him in a few days. Okay. I won't be around much longer. I'm done after Anthony. What are you gonna do? Shit, I don't know. Teach. That's what you want? The thought makes me wanna throw up. But I know I don't want this. I don't wanna see another client try to bust his head open, commit suicide... before you guys get to him. You know what side I'm on. Think about this. When I win, my client gets to not die. How do you keep doing it? I do my job. You wanna believe there's good guys and bad guys, and I'm one of the bad guys. But I give these men respect, Marty. All the way through. I give them real-world training for whenever some of them might get out. You can't save the world. Yeah. That's the problem. [sighs] Thanks for the drink. You have a good night, Warden. Night. [Jonathan] Good evening, baby. [scoffs] [Bernadine] Good evening. I know you said you didn't want anything this year, but... Oh. Oh. Happy anniversary. - [laughing] - Jonathan. Yeah. It is beautiful. I know. I wanna get back to where we were, Bernadine. And I know we can. Hmm? Hmm. Oh. And you're gonna like this. [light funk music] Give me that. ♪ Hey there, sexy mama ♪ ♪ Baby, what's your name? ♪ Oh, Bernadine. ♪ Hey there, sexy mama ♪ Ohh. - I love you, baby. - I love you too. I love you too. Oh, you feel so good. Yeah, I want you. I want you so bad. - Baby. - Yeah. ♪ You look so fine... ♪ Damn. Mmm. ♪ Girl, I love your ways... ♪ I want this to be my last year. Your last year for what? It's not that far off from when we talked about retiring. [scoffing] What? Wait, babe. The... Is that what this is all about? That... This is my anniversary. Oh, God. I can't believe you. Baby, I think stepping away from our jobs would be good for us, be good for you. You know what? You do what you need to do. And mine is not a job. It's a profession. And me, it will be good for me too. Yeah, it's all about you. [music stops] I don't know if this is gonna make things better, but I'm trying. I'm the one who gave things up in this marriage. What did you give up? What did you give up? I'm just reminding you that I sacrificed... because I love you. And I respect your profession. And I want this to work. But I don't see how it's gonna work... living with an empty shell of a wife. I need a pulse, Bernadine. I need to know that you're still here, that I'm still here. Okay. [door opens] [door slams] [Marty] Anthony has always maintained culpability in the crime of robbery, which he did commit that night, for which he has more than paid, serving almost 15 years on death row. Yet... Yet he maintains, and we maintain, that he was not involved in the shooting. Surveillance footage of the convenience store that night shows two masked men. - [people shouting] - The shooter was left-handed and considerably shorter than Anthony Woods, who is right-handed. And new ballistic technology proves that the type of gun used in the shooting of Officer Collins that night was owned by James Taylor. This was also confirmed by several people who knew James from his neighborhood. Four of the five eyewitnesses have recanted their statements. Most of the jurors from the original trial have stated that they cannot say with 100% certainty that Anthony Wood was the shooter. All this... and James Taylor. [distant shouting] [woman] Abolish the death penalty! [Bernadine] The last meal is your choice. Anything. Anything you want, just about. Like seafood, halal. Vegan. A lot of guys want steak and lobster. But it's your... it's your choice. You get to choose. Mr. Woods. You do something for yourself. You need to eat something. Let me know. Hang on, Mr. Woods. [Jonathan] "I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe. Nor am I one of your Hollywood movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids. And I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me, they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination. Indeed, everything and anything, except me." [bell ringing] [all chattering] Hey. Aren't you supposed to be at work? I left early. I wanted to catch you. [sighs] Bernadine, I can't. Okay. Where have you been staying? A motel nearby. Which one? I need to pack up and head out of here. - Are you coming home? - I don't know, Bernadine. I miss you. I, uh... I gotta go. ♪ On a road by the river ♪ ♪ Take the slow train Above the sea ♪ ♪ Won't you ride along ♪ ♪ And I'll be waiting ♪ ♪ You can come Back home to me ♪ ♪ Come on and find me ♪ ♪ Find me ♪ ♪ Baby, please find me ♪ ♪ Find me ♪ ♪ On this slow train tonight ♪ ♪ Oh, find me ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ Baby, find me ♪ [keys rattling] It's always this easy? You can resist a little if you want to. Treat him like you would. [grunting] There usually isn't any resistance. After you restrain him, I want you all to wait in the room with the major, just in case we need you back out here. You got that, Major? Logan? - Logan? - [knocking on window] Logan? Logan. [sighing] I'm sorry. I, um... [sighing] I couldn't stop seeing him. You can't be on the team. I'll find your replacement this week. I'm sorry, Bernadine. This process... Our department's top priority. The procedure... The procedure is safe to... Warden. Sorry to interrupt. Our mail clerk brought me something this afternoon. Sonia, there's plenty of people you can talk to about the mail besides me. I know. But this should be you. They've never been here before. Warden, he shouldn't have to die alone. [Jonathan] Bernie. [shouting, panting] Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. It's me, baby girl. Oh, God, you scared me. I know, I know. Shh. [groans] All right. [panting] What are you doing here? This is our home. This is our home. Oh. Hmm. [crowd] No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace. No justice, no peace. I am Anthony Woods! We are Anthony Woods! I am Anthony Woods! I am Anthony Woods! I am Anthony Woods! We are Anthony Woods! We are Anthony Woods! You really could've e-mailed me these papers. Oh, we know. But we thought maybe it'd make a difference if we asked you in person. Oh, we know that there's a limit, we do. But we really wanted to bring in another witness on Robert's side. It's his son, our grandson. We already have ten people attending the execution. Mrs. Williams, he's his son. And we just want him to have some closure. I understand that. I'm sorry. But is there anybody from his side coming? I mean, most people like him don't usually have much family sticking around. Can't we take one of their places? It's not done like that, Mrs. Collins. We understand. Mrs. Williams, I'm sure you've made exceptions before. [Bernadine] No, I haven't. Or you just won't. Sandra. He wants to go. There's nothing you can do? No, ma'am. [sighs] Thank you for your time. [Bernadine] Certainly. Are you permitting them to make that noise out there? [Bernadine] It's outside my jurisdiction. It's not state property. Are they gonna be there the day it happens? I'm sure they will be. [Mr. Collins] She can't control who shows up outside. Come on, honey. I know it's your job... not to get personally involved, but can you imagine... how difficult this is for a mother? Hmm? Do you have children, Mrs. Williams? Sandy, let's go. [scoffs] Can... Can you understand what all this kind of thing does to a family? Thank you. You're welcome, Mr. Collins. I feel good about the team. And you made the right call, removing Logan from this duty. You know, that warden's position opened up. You'd make a good warden. You think so? I can handle it. Been seeing you do it for years. Of course, there's no death row in that prison. I'm gonna go for it. You should. Really. Good luck. Thanks. We haven't been to the bar in a while. I've been having dinner with Jonathan. That's good. I'm really glad you two are having dinner together again. [buzzer sounds] Warden, I'm seeing a lot of you lately. Thank you. Pretty soon, your wife will be seeing a lot more of you. Oh, retirement will be good for both of us. It's always during these times that I see you around here. It's my 12th. Hey, have you been able to talk with Woods? He's not really one you talk to. I'm just trying to let him go at his own pace. Well, keep trying, if you can. It just... He has shut down completely. Warden, you know a lot of these guys that come in here aren't very religious. These services are really the only time they can scream and holler and get all that stuff out. Even if it's through a gospel song. Sometimes when I try to talk to Woods, he just screams and hollers like the rest of them. If it were up to me, I'd stay. I've always felt drawn to this kind of work. But my wife started seeing things in me those nights I'd come home. I think Victor Jimenez was the last straw. I can't sleep. You are gonna enjoy retirement. I think so. Warden, um, I'll try to talk to him again. Thanks, David. So, how was it with Philip and Danisha? [Jonathan laughing] Well, my students are great. I'm gonna miss them. I talked to Chris today at the firm. And, uh... we're in a good place financially for this to happen. On my end. You do what you need to do when you're ready. Why are you so sure now is the time? Because I felt like I was shrinking. I've been giving more to my students than to myself, than to us. And I'm sorry. Bernadine, I see you at night... and I don't think you wanna live in fragments anymore either. I think you wanna be whole. Even if it's not with me, I think you wanna be whole. I want... I want us... to be whole again. When did you find out? About a week ago. - She's coming today, yeah? - Yep. She... She wouldn't have sent the photo, she... she wouldn't be coming to see me if she didn't want us to be a family. This is... This is a good sign. I feel it. I really do. Mm-hmm. This is a good sign. Say it. Why'd she wait until now to talk to you? Why is she just seeing you now? After all the things that you've been going through, Anthony, you don't need any more disappointments. Any more? Then you don't think they'll give me clemency? Well, that's what we're fighting for. You don't think that'll happen? I don't know what'll happen. I'm just saying that we should keep our expectations realistic for everything. This is why you're retiring. You're giving up. I am not giving up. I am not giving up. But I've been around a long time. And... I just don't think one can find hope in other people's decisions. You've given me hope. Marty, you... - [officer] Let's go. - I got... I got a family now. I got a... Look. I got a family, and that gives me hope. Let's go. Hey, I can't do this on my own anymore. I... I can't. I... I can't do this on my own. - [man] What do we want? - [crowd] Respect for life. - When do we want it? - Here and now. - What do we want? - Respect for life. - When do want it? - Here and now. - What do we want? - Respect for life. - When do we want it? - Here and now. - What do we want? - Respect for life. - When do we want it? - Here and now. - I am... - Anthony Woods. - We are... - Anthony Woods. - I am... - Anthony Woods. - We are... - Anthony Woods. - I am... - Anthony Woods. - We are... - Anthony Woods. - I am... - Anthony Woods. - We are... - Anthony Woods. - I am... - Anthony Woods. - We are... - Anthony Woods. - I am... - Anthony Woods. - We are... - Anthony Woods. - I am... - Anthony Woods. - We are... - Anthony Woods. - I am... - Anthony Woods. - We are... - Anthony Woods. - I am... - Anthony Woods. - We are... - Anthony Woods. [door opens] [buzzer sounds] [door closes] Tony. [laughs] [sighs] You... You look, uh... You look the same. What made you agree to see me? Because you're the most important person in the world to me. I shouldn't have waited so long to tell you. And I shouldn't have told you the way that I did. But, Tony, that day that you were arrested, I really... Just... Just don't. We don't need to talk about that stuff. Tony, that day that, uh, you were arrested... Stop. You're not listening to me. You're trying to explain yourself to me, but I... I know. I know. I... I know you feel sorry. I know you feel guilty. You fucked up. I just... I just... I don't wanna hear any of that right now. Talking about the past isn't gonna help save my life, E. You're here now. I'm here now with you. And I still love you. And I forgive you. It's taken so long, but I can't live with this... this... I can't hate anymore. Not with what they're about to do to me. I need to see him. I need to see him. Okay? I... I just need to see him. We can just... We can, um... Wow. We could be together, you know? Just be like... like... I can have a family again, you know? Tony, that night that they arrested you, I was pregnant and I had to make a decision. Did you not hear everything I just said, Evette? You were about to be convicted of a murder - and I was barely out of high school. - I told you I don't... There was someone else that wanted to marry me. I was scared, okay? I don't need to hear this shit no more. I know you're sorry. I'm not sorry. I wrote those letters to explain why I left and why I wasn't at your trial and why I couldn't tell you about the pregnancy, but I am not sorry for any of it. I'm not sorry for choosing the better option. And I'm not sorry for choosing to leave you when you needed me the most so that I could build a life for myself. And I'm not sorry for choosing the well-being of my son... our son... over you... over us. Because I would make those choices again if I had to. I wanted you to know the truth about Michael before the... before the execution. I love you. And there is no reason for you to still believe that, but I... I know you do. You, Anthony Woods, are loved. People are fighting for you. People are doing what I couldn't do, and I own that. I ran. And... I have chosen a life of barely existing. And I love my son. And I'm happy that he has a home... and a good education and more opportunities than you and... you and I have ever had. But when I die, I will only be a memory to a handful of people. But when you die... your name will live on for lifetimes. I'm sorry. Tony, I'm sorry. [crying] You can see your son, okay? Babe. [crying] [officer] Come on, Woods. [sighing] [sniffles] [buzzer sounds] [door opens] [door closes] I'm here with Anthony's defense attorney, Marty Lumetta, who says it's not over yet and that his team has already asked for a reprieve from the governor's office, whose decision could override that of the parole board. Mr. Lumetta, thank you for joining us today. - I know how extremely busy you are. - Sure. These next 24 hours are crucial for you, your team, and of course, Anthony. Can you explain to us what happens next? You say it's not over. Oh, well, no. It's not over. We've asked for a reprieve from the governor's office considering what happened. What happened during the state's last execution, we're hoping that would certainly be reason enough to hold off any further actions regarding Anthony until we get more answers about what happened last time. [news anchor] And how is he doing? Well, his spirits are up. We're heartened by all the public support. Um, Anthony is actually quite moved by it all. I... I definitely see in him more hope these last few days. - Thank you, Mr. Lumetta. - My pleasure. [woman] The controversy surrounding this... Do you think he did it? ...has reignited debates about the death penalty and whether or not it is an effective form of punishment within our criminal justice system. I wasn't sure you really wanted to hear my opinion. I don't know if he killed the guy or not, but... it's hard watching what's about to happen to that guy. Woods has a son. His name is Michael. Michael doesn't know Woods is his dad. Woods just found out Michael was his. She's supposed to bring Michael... over to meet Woods for the first time tomorrow. His lawyers keep filing these appeals, and they all get denied. I ask him where he wants to be buried, what he wants for his bullshit last meal. And he's still gonna die, just no matter what I do or don't do. He's... He's dead. Just dead. They're all dead. All of them, all of them. Twelve. I'm sorry. Why are you apologizing? I'm... sorry. I'm trying to be supportive. I'm trying to understand you. I just don't... I can't be touched right now. Jonathan. You can't understand. That's the problem. I don't know how to fix it. Because you can't know what it's like to look... at these people every day, to talk to them every day. Look in their faces, look in their families' faces. You can't know that because you don't do what I do, what I have to do. I just need you to know that. That's it. Just... I just need you to know that... I am alone... and nobody can fix it. Bernadine. [sniffling] [man on TV] Find your new home rental. Did you know you can hire a real estate agent... Yes. All the equipment has been checked and cleared. Right. Okay. When will I get my paperwork? Okay. Yes. All right, thank you, sir. Thank you. Right. Goodbye. [crowd chanting in distance] [ticking] [clearing throat] [line ringing] [voice mail beeping] Evette, this is Bernadine Williams. Um... give me a call. Thank you. [Bernadine] They should be here soon. I'll give you 45 minutes. Okay? Thank you. [clearing throat] [tapping foot] Water? Thank you. [Bernadine] You're welcome. [footsteps] [cell phone ringing] [Bernadine] Yes? I'll call him back as soon as I get to my office. Hey. Has Evette Wilkinson showed up yet? Are you sure? Okay. Mr. Woods. [Bernadine] I'm sorry. [ticking] [exhales] [clears throat] [exhales] [beeping on line] Um... Bernadine Williams here. Um... we need you to call over here. I need you to call, Evette. Okay. Just call. [sighs] There's still time, Anthony. Clemency has hap... has happened right up until the last minutes, the last seconds. We have our assistant glued to the phone, standing by. As soon the governor calls, we're gonna jump into action. You know what? You know, all the people want... no matter who they are, no matter where they've been, no matter what they've done, all we want is to be seen and to be heard. That's it. That's what this whole fucked up thing on this earth is all about, to be seen and to be heard. And for the last few weeks, Anthony, people have seen you, people are listening to you. I know it's hard for you to believe, I know that. But you do not have to be alone. It is not over. [knocking on door] [exhales] It's not over. [officer] Chaplain. I'm gonna be right here, Anthony. I ain't going anywhere. I ain't going anywhere. Okay? I will be right here. [Bernadine] Scarlett? Ma'am. Mrs. Collins? Miss Williams, are you expecting any delays? Someone from the governor's office could call up to the last second to call it off. But... you think that's gonna happen this time? No, I don't... I don't think so. But, you know, you never know. [crying] Oh, good Lord. Thank you. Um, I'll let you know when it's time. May I share something with you? "For I am certain that neither death nor life, neither angels nor heavenly powers, neither present nor future, neither the world above nor below, in fact, nothing at all in all creation, is able to separate us from the love of God." Anthony. That love of God is seen everywhere around you. The lawyers who've been fighting for you. The people who've been shouting your name every single day right outside this prison. They're gonna keep on loving you, no matter how this ends. [crying] [screaming] [knock on door] Warden? We heard back from the governor's office. [chains rattling] [door buzzes] [door opens] [machine beeping] [steady beeping] [panting] [Bernadine clears throat] [breathing heavily] [Anthony groaning] [Bernadine] Would you like to make a final statement? First, I'd like to address the Collins family. I just wanna let you all know that, despite this situation, I know that you all are still convinced that I killed your father, your son, your brother, but I didn't shoot your family member. I'm so sorry for your loss. I really am, sincerely. To all the people that supported me, I'm truly grateful. Even when your support and your love wasn't clear to me, I... I still felt it, and no one can take that away from me. And to my family... I love you, Ma. I'll see you soon. And to all the people that are about to take my life, may God have mercy on your soul. [exhales] [beeping continues] [machine humming] [beeping slows] [beeping fades] [machine flatlining] [woman] Warden? Warden? Time of death, 11:23 p.m. [machine flatlining] Warden. Bernadine. Go ahead and record the time of death as 11:23 p.m. [beeping stops] [knocking on door] [Thomas] Disconnect the room. Take his body to the exam room. Are you here, Bernadine? Are you here?
