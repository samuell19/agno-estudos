So what are your plans for the summer? I'm going to Hawaii with my boyfriend. That's nice. My old grandma... She ruined everything. Now my whole savings are gone. Alisha, I heard your dad is all over TV because he finally rescued those Mexican girls from the mafia. So, now summer in Tijuana? You must be excited, right? Yeah, um... I don't know. I've... I've always kept my distance from him. He keeps coming. I would kill for a guy like that to be my father. - He's a hero. - That's true. and he's super smoky. I even have my own plans of going with her to Tijuana. So, tell us, A. Why are you really going with your father? You tell me! I'm going with you. So, you both are traveling together? Agent Mark Patson. Yes, the name seems to be familiar to most of us. He's the same Agent Patson who eliminated the deadly Gorilla gang and lost his wife in the crossfire with one of the last surviving gang members. It took his team some time to track down the Mexican mafia who trafficked these girls across the border-- Well, there he is! Hey, hey, no! Don't you even start. Don't do it. - Hi Agent Mark. Congrats. - Hey, Sofia. Nice to see you. Hey, Chris. How you doing? You have saved us from a crisis, Mark. The nation is proud. The shot that you took for such a long distance and without any light proved your perfect skills. I'm proud to work under you, Agent Mark. Well, don't be too proud of me. Be proud of Tijuana police. They took the shot. This is much interesting to see than the Gorilla gang takedown in San Diego. Good memory for that. Thanks, Sofia. You're too kind. Okay, look. I appreciate it, but just get back to what you all were doing, okay? - Sir? - Mm? Can I have a quiet word, please? Sure. Tijuana police. Bravo! Hey, Ivan. Thanks for the support, okay? And then again, honestly, I just wanna say I appreciate the support over the years. I mean that. So, what can I do for you, Mark? What is this? Is this is a joke? Come on, Mark. Why now? Look, I would suggest that this is not the right time for early retirement. With all due respect sir, I think I've made my decision. Look, I've been planning this since Catherine passed away, John. Since Alisha walked out of my life. Kind of why I took this particular job. And I understand, okay? I do. I'll tell you what; why don't you take the night and think about it? Okay? You know what? I realized something when we reunited that family with those little girls. And, uh, I realized I'm a horrible father. I realized I've never been there for Alisha. I mean, she blames me for Catherine's death, John. So, you see, I've got this little... This little window of opportunity to do something right. Before her hatred washes me completely from her heart. And I'm not gonna let that happen. I'm not. Hm... So, what are your plans for summer now? Thank you, sir. Hey. Okay, who are you and what are you doing here? What are you doing-- What are you doing here, buddy? Put your hands on your head. Put your hands on your head! God, Mark! It's the plumber I brought to fix the drain, remember? Oh, Jesus, Miriam. I'm sorry. Okay, I don't care. Wait a minute. Tell him I wanna see his passport. Your ID! It's all okay. He's all good, Mark. Trust me. You know me, hon. I'm sorry, okay? - I'm sorry. I forgot. - That's okay. Pardon, senor. No problem. - He speaks perfect English. - It's okay. Is it me or did he sound like he was from Malibu? What can I get you? Do you want a coffee? You're adorable. Hi. You haven't changed that much at all. I didn't expect to see you here. I was planning to catch a cab. Well, I'm here. And of course I'm gonna be here, Alisha. You're still my daughter after all, right? Let's be very clear on this. I buried all of the memories I have with you the day that I lost my mom. I'm just here for my summer vacation. So let's just stay out of each other's way and you can carry on with your life. And you let me do my own thing. You're sure you're not coming? It's gonna be so much fun! Please, please, please! I'm good. I'm gonna stay here. Okay, study for me. I'll take a shot for you. Take four shots. Everybody take shots. Okay, let's go. Bye! - Come on, girls! - Bye! Have a great night! Bye. You too! Be safe. And sober! Love you! Sober. Do you feel like stopping for some food? No. Well, there's no food at the house. I'll tell you what. I'm gonna stop and get us a little something, okay? - Hey, man! - Hey! - That's for me, right? - Yeah. Oh, you guys are fast! Okay, that's great. Okay. Do me a favor. Just give me a... one latte to go and no sugar. Okay, boss? - Yeah. - Okay. - Hey! - Hey! What are you doing? This is my friend, Viola! Oh, geez! I'm sorry, Alisha! I... I'm sorry, I... It's okay. No need to apologize. I'm fine. I appreciate your kindness. Hey, so I'll see you after my trip? It was really nice meeting you, agent Mark. I appreciate you. And good luck with Stephen. - Bye! - See you. So, who's Stephen? Don't worry about it. I worry about everything. You know that, right? Is that what I know? Come on in. Okay, come on in. Come on. This is it. Built it about five or six years ago with a real good friend of mine. Every stone, the wood. As I said, there's a story for everything in this place. I won't bore you for now. Plumbing, we got a little problem, but you've got hot water, so that's a good thing, eh? Your room is up top there on the left. Uh, this is it. What can I say? Make yourself at home. - Great. - Okay? Let me help you up with the bag. I got it. No worries here. Okay. Right up to the left. That's you. Right. Okay, anything you need just let me know. God damnit. Give me the mayonnaise, man. No. - Dad. - Mm-hmm? You know that you're the talk of the town, right? Like, all my school is talking about the Gorilla gang takedown... Alisha. Time for school. And you do know that this is putting our family at risk? We're not safe because of you. And you being in your limelight. Like, do you think about our family at all when you're out there saving whoever you're saving? That's enough, Alisha! - Of course I do. - Do you think about us? Okay, Alisha, that's enough. You're gonna be late. Alisha. Come on, just give me a second. It's not that simple. See you sweetie. I love you, dear. I don't know but... I... She's right. At the end of the day, she's right. - No, no, no, no. - No, she's right. Oh, man. You guys are my family. Maybe she'll see that one day, but that's it. You guys are everything to me. I know. Why don't we go to the bank? Sure, okay. - Okay? - You got it. Five minutes? Okay, let's go. - To the bank. - Maybe stop for something to eat on the way back? Get some food? Something? - Okay. - Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna go quickly to the bank. - Gonna get us some money, baby? - Yeah. - Yeah? A lot of money? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - I'll be back. I'll be here. Hey, Miriam! Come on in! Hey, Mark! Brought you and Alisha some food tonight. Ah, thank you. How kind of you. Save me some cooking time 'cause you know how bad I am at cooking. - No! - Thanks, sweetheart. - Yeah. - I'll tell you what. Do you have a minute? She's in her room. Think maybe it's a good time we introduce you to her. - What do you think? - I'd love to meet her. - I'd love that too. Come on. - All right. Yup? Hey. So, uh... Hey, look. Sorry to disturb you. I just wanted to introduce you to an old friend of mine, okay? One of my dearest friends. Her name is Miriam. She lives next door. She's the one who's been watching over me and the house for years. I just wanted you to say hello. Hey. I think we had a deal that we weren't going to bother each other. So, please, enjoy the day with your friend. All right. Hey, Mark. You know, I left the hot plate on, hon. Just go and check on that. Let her rest. - All right? - Okay. It's a pleasure to meet you, hon. Nice to meet you. Off of me! Hi! Hi, sir! So, I... Somebody stole my wallet, basically. And I need to get home. But I don't have any money to give you now. Okay, I'll give you the money when I get home. It's not that far. We can just go there and I'll... I'll give you... I have... Hey, so... I need a ride home. Someone just stole my cell phone and my wallet and my money. But I can give you my money when I get home. - Sure. - Okay, uh... No, we're good. No, you can go. You can go! I'll get the next one. Sure, we're good. No, we're good. I'll drive you. Just get in. No. - All right. - Hey, hey! - Alisha? - Damn it. Shh! I'm your neighbor. Brought you and your dad food the other night. What's the matter, baby? Oh! I'm sorry about yesterday. I know I was rude before. Don't worry about it. Tell me what you were doing out there. Someone pickpocketed my wallet and I had my cell phone in it. I tried to call my dad, but he keeps changing his number. And then no taxi was gonna give me a ride home without money, and... Then you showed up. I'm glad that I did. Let's tell your father... No! Can we just stop and keep this between us? I don't wanna involve him. At least let me help find-- Just have your dad find your cell phone and your wallet, okay? That's all. That's all we're gonna tell him. Okay. Hey, Mark! Yes, I'm out with Alisha, baby. We went shopping. Oh, yes, yes. While we were shopping she misplaced her cell phone and wallet. Can you find it, please? Perfect. We'll be home soon. See? It's okay. Alisha, baby, it looks great. I hope you like it. I know we will. I know your dad will too. Thank you for today. No. I'm just glad I was there for you, baby. Hey, guys. - So... - That was quick. Hey, what can I say? I know a few people. Some guy called Stephen has been ringing for you, over and over. Maybe you should call him back and tell him you're okay. Maybe I should do that, definitely. Thanks. Miriam, who's this Stephen guy? I was gonna ask you the same thing. But I was gonna ask you the same thing. Mark, you... Cheers, love. Thanks for dinner. Who made this? - Your baby. - She made it? She did. I cannot wait to see you, babe. See you soon. See you soon. What if I say I have a boyfriend? But... You don't, so... It's just us. Us? Seems like you've already made my decision for me. Of course! I'm confident. So...? What are your plans for this summer? I am making my bucket list as we speak. I hope that you're adding me to that list. Maybe. We just have to plan it. Now, let's say grace really quick. I've got to watch my favorite program, okay? Please. Dear Lord in Heaven, bless this food we're about to receive. Bless everybody in this house, Please, bless some will forgive others for all their craziness. Amen. Amen. Your baby made this. You made this? I made it, yeah. - You can cook? - I can. You're not an eater, but you can cook. How does that work, Miriam? I mean, usually people that like to cook like to eat. I don't know. Let's see what you got, kid. Had to learn a thing or two on my own. I'm sure you did. - Hi. - Hi, babe. I couldn't stop thinking about you since last time we talk. Yeah. It's been a long 30 minutes. Well, for you it's been 30 minutes, for me it feels like a year. Time freezes. Oh, only when I'm talking with you. So, I was thinking... What would you like to do when we see each other? Ah, Stephen. Let me call you back in a second. Dad. I'm okay. It's not the first time. Okay. That's enough, Dad. Okay. You were right. It's all my fault. It's all my fault that... Agent... Good old Patson... I can't even find this... shooter who killed my wife. I am a complete failure. I'm sorry. I really, really... I'm sorry. You're gonna go to sleep now. Good morning, Miriam. Oh, look who's up. Yeah. Hey, I appreciate this, thanks. Oh, it's not me. Alisha did that and she took care of you last night. Yeah. And where is she? Oh, she just went for a run, honey. She'll be back soon. Miriam, didn't I tell you not to leave her alone? That's the one thing I asked you, not to leave her alone. Mark, you didn't think I was gonna go running with her, did you? Come on. Oh, there she is. Come say hello-- what...? What? Baby girl, what happened? Come over here. Oh, my God. What happened? Mark, Mark. Get me the first aid kit. - Jesus! - Mark, please. It's alright. No, it's not. Hold it like this, baby. - Okay. - Thank you. Give me a look at this. I wanna know what happened. Tell me-- I wanna know what happened! Tell me what happened right now. Please, tell us what happened. I don't know. I was... Running and... There was this guy who tried to hit me, so... Do you remember anything about the man? The vehicle, any numbers, any body features of the driver? Come on, Mark. She's not gonna remember any of that. A-L-A-15-0-1-A. It was a man with a black hood. And a jacket. Mid-forties. Right-handed. Never got that shit from my dad's DNA. Hey, Victor. It's Mark. Do me a favor. Run a number on a plate for me. ALA-15-0-1-A. Yeah, you got it. So, office came back with word that the fake plate your daughter talked about actually belongs to a rookie who does low-end drug peddling. He reported it missing last week. But it turns out he's the one that stole and put the fake plate on it. On top of that, the night before there's a robbery. Same place, same location, same vehicle. Just merely a coincidence. I mean, we are on it, but... I don't think it has anything to do with your family. Let's hope so. Yeah. We're on it, though, so if you need anything, just let me know. Thanks for coming out, Victor. - It's a pleasure. - Okay. - See you. - All right. Who's that? That's Victor. He works with your father. I believe it's about the license plate number you gave him. You guys ready to do some shooting? Your dad also mentioned possibly going to the shooting range. Won't that be fun? Maybe we can hit the beach after. Super cool. Let's go kill us something, babe. Let me ask you a question. What do they call you? - Uh, Big Mike. - Big Mike. Okay, Big Mike, here's the deal. If that sink isn't fixed by the time we're back, I'm taking you to jail. You're getting there. You're getting there, Miriam. Let's see what you've got. I want you to listen to something, okay? The only person in this life that you think you can trust other than yourself is me. Because I'm your father, and I would never do anything to hurt you, you understand? Damn it, Mark! There's your fucking DNA again. What? - Dad? - Jesus Christ! - Brace yourselves! - Dad! God! Shit! Yeah. She'll be fine. - Really? - Yes. Hey. How's she doing? We'll see. I hope she's okay. Look, uh... They found a bunch of needles in the wheel. Tore it apart. It's all we got. - Thanks, Victor. - Yeah. This ain't no coincidence. You're right. Hope she gets better soon. She'll be okay. - Good. All right. - I'll see you. - Okay. - Thanks, man. Sir. Sir! This area is restricted. I'm sorry, you cannot enter. Man, we don't need to do this. Just come with me. I miss... My mom. I haven't been in a hospital since... I'll tell you a little story about when I was in the hospital. When I met your mother. You might like it. It's about meeting your mom. Back in '91. I was special forces during the Gulf War, and... I got shot. So they take me to this medical clinic. It's a military hospital. And it was in tangent with this cancer treatment facility, right? They're tending to my wound. I look up, and there she is. Tall. Bald. Proud and... Beautiful. She was telling the clerk how she didn't have any money to make her payments for the next three or four treatments. And how she wouldn't be alive if she didn't get the treatments. I had a little money back then so I, uh, I took care of the payments. She got her treatments. Little did I know that... at that time, who knew that that woman, that big, bald, beautiful woman would end up becoming my whole life. Can I ask you something? Sure. Who's that person in the photo, with the distorted face. You know. The one you keep with the newspaper cuttings of mom's death. I'm gonna check you out and get you home. Alisha, baby. It's my family. I miss them a lot. You must be. Yeah, but that's when Mark came and... And then he brought you. Now the void is gone. I feel like I have a family again. Oh, it's okay, baby. But why are you dressed like this? My friend Viola wants me to hang out with her but I don't think... Yeah, you're right. Your father will not let you go. Yeah, so if you could... Only if you promise to take me to church tomorrow. Done. Fine, I'll cover for you. Oh, these kids. Should have been there by now. Yeah, I know but... What does it matter? They're in the club already. Like they're three guys. My friends have been waiting for me. I should be there. Yeah, I don't care about your friends. What, should I care about your friend then? Yeah. It's the first time you meet her. She's my best friend. I really hope it's worth it. - Yeah. - I really do. Yeah, here she comes. - Hey, baby! How are you? - Hey guys. Meet the boy of my life, Raul. Raul, meet Alisha. She's my best friend, okay? We've gotta go. We've gotta go. Here we are. This is the place. You brought me to see naked ladies? Like, with your girlfriend? It wasn't my first place. Why would you do that? Have you been to places like this? No. This place's so good. It's the best place on the block. Well, it's uh... Let's have fun. Yeah, absolutely. Let's get some shots. Shots? Can you freshen up this hookah for me? Yeah, definitely. Do you have a cigarette? Yo! That's my boy. - Hey, Joseph! - Hey! Give me two seconds. Yeah. Hey, do you have a cigarette? So how are you feeling about this place? What? You know I don't like him for you, right? He says he's changed. Yeah. He says, but apparently he hasn't. He loves me. I can handle him. I can handle him, I swear. It's okay, I'm okay. We are here to party. Get in the mood. Make some space. Make some space. Make some space. There! Okay, here I got Joseph. - Panchito, and Benja. - Hi, nice to meet you. Let's get some shots going. Ah, well, well. Let's get this party going. No way, guys. I don't do drugs. What do you mean you don't do drugs? It's okay, it's fine. You're here with me. Let's do this. We're here together, nothing is going to happen. Don't worry, don't worry. Trust me. You're here with me. Okay? Let's do this, eh? That's some good stuff boys! Come on, come on. Try, try. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Hey! Get some more shots? Come on! Babe, come on, let's get some more shots. Hey. Where were you? - I was-- - I was in the bathroom. - Where is Viola? - Ah, don't worry about it. - Come on. Give me a kiss. - Stop. I said stop. What the fuck? Oh, my God! Who the fuck are you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's okay. Let's go. - It's okay -VIOLA: I'm sorry. Hey... I'm sorry. What would've happened if your dad wouldn't have gotten there on time? I'm so sorry. It's okay. Okay, the car is here. I have to go. Are you gonna see me tomorrow? Are we gonna see each other? Yes, we're gonna see each other tomorrow. Every day. Every day, yes. Okay, thank you so much for being there. I love you. Okay? I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Thanks. I'm so sorry. It was not her fault. It was all mine. It's okay. Don't worry about it. I did a lot worse when I was your age. Okay? Just don't it again. Okay? You're a good kid. And I like you being her best friend. You're good for each other. You get that, right? - Yes. - Okay. Now, if there's anything you need, you let me know. All right? And I'm never drinking again. Me too. Okay. Look after her. See you. Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Where are you guys going? Miriam, do you have a minute, please? I wanna talk to you guys about something. Yes, of course, Mark. But now I need to speak to God. Talk to God, okay. Can he wait five minutes, maybe? - What do you think? - Oh, honey, you know me. I don't let God wait. Take me to church, Alisha. Yeah. After, you know... I lost my family, and your dad... He came in for me. Became my family. Took care of everything. Who was that? Oh, her son had a terrible accident. She couldn't pay for it. Your father, he took care of everything. And now her son is going to the nationals. Isn't that great? I think we should head home. Ah, okay. First, let me stop at the office. You have an office? Of course I have an office. Let's go. This is Alisha. Alisha, this is Juana. She takes care of the place. Okay, okay. I'll take care of that. I'll have to take a phone call, hon. You just go ahead and look around. Juana will take care of you, okay? So how did you become involved in this place? This organization? It was handed down to my husband. And... My husband put his blood, sweat, and tears into this place. But after his passing, it all went down. Your father came in, financed us... He's the most noble man that I know. That's why, Alisha baby, you know deep down in your heart he's not to blame for any of this. Well, well, well. Look who has an appetite. I'm going to the store. You need anything? No, I don't think so. Okay. Enjoy your sandwich. Expecting something? No. It's got your name on it. See you. Expecting something? No. It's got your name on it. Hey. My keys... Where are my keys? Did I leave my keys somewhere? No, you took your keys with you. - Are you sure? - I saw you do it. I got the keys, right? Yeah, I got the keys. Okay. - How you doing, Mark? - Hey, John. Hey, Victor. Thanks for coming, guys. I want you guys to check this out. What's this? Look, I don't see anything unusual. Same thing as last time. Right, look. Okay, I get that. You remember the guy that ran Alisha off the road in his car, right? Okay, apparently this guy was wearing a black hoodie. Look, so what? We already investigated this. It's a false alarm. Keep watching, John. Okay, I made a slight edit on the tape. You see that? This guy has been circling our house, John. At least seven to ten times. There's no reports of him stopping nearby. This is not a coincidence. This guy is circling our house. - You do understand? - Yeah. Yeah, we get it. We get it. You know what? You may be onto something. We're gonna look into it. All right? - I appreciate that. -Don't worry. We got this. Okay. You got it, John. Thanks for coming again. - Victor, thank you. - Okay. Hi. Hi, babe. How you doing? Guess where I'm at. You're not close, are you? Well, I'll be outside your door in five minutes. No, Stephen. I have to tell my dad something. Come on, I'll be there in five minutes. Don't worry. No, I have to tell... Oh, God. - Dad? - Hey, what's up? Well, Viola was-- Hold that thought, just one second. What's up? - Viola... - Hold on! Yeah, what is it? Mark, you won't believe this. Check this out. Jesus Christ We actually expected a drug peddler to show up. But seeing the guest we have... The hotel has been seized and he's under our radar. Do you want us to move in? No. You wait for me. I'll be right there. Dad, well, I was gonna tell you that... I'm gonna be right back, okay? I'll be right back. Stay safe! - Hey, Mark. How's it going? - Hey, guys. What have we got? So, the word is, he's up on the sixth floor. Room 623. We've got him under surveillance. Doesn't know we're coming. - We good? - We're good. We'll take the left stairs. You guys take the right. We'll surveil the place. Let's make it happen, let's go. Let's go! Come here! Come here! Hey! Hey! What the fuck? What? What is this? Who are you? If you don't tell me what's going on, I'm gonna put a bullet in your head right now. Come on, it's closed. Open it. You open it. I waited like seven years. You're gonna make me wait more? This door doesn't open. - Ah, really? - You have to go to this one. Okay. I'm going. Pick up, pick up, pick up. I hate this show. I love you 'cause you're sexy. But I hate this show. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Come on, baby, pick up. Come on! Pick up! Oh, you caca. Oh, my effing phone. It's fucking dead. I'd better go check on the family. This walk is too far. Just gonna have to move in with them. Miriam! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! He's behind you, Miriam! Miriam, oh, Miriam! Oh, my God... - Dad! - Baby? Baby? Are you with me? What's he doing? What's he doing? Can you see him? Daddy... He's just... He just... He just killed Miriam. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid, you'll be fine. Okay? What's he doing right now? Oh, my God! He killed Stephen too! He just killed him right in front of me! Oh, no. It's not gonna hold, baby. He's coming in no matter what. He's coming in. Make your way up to my bedroom, okay? Barricade the door. Get some chairs. Whatever you got. Whatever is in there. Just wait for me, baby. I won't be long. Just remember something. Kill or be killed. You're fucked! Shit! Come here... I'm gonna choke you out dead! But not yet, you little cunt! - Hey, hey. - Listen to me How you killed my family. Listen to me, if you hurt my daughter... You know what? I enjoyed killing your wife. If you hurt my daughter, I am gonna blow up-- Fuck yourself. You fucking hurt my daughter-- Hey. Listen up. Listen. Listen... I'm gonna fucking end you. Fucking listen to me! I am gonna end you! Boy, shut the fuck up. I am gonna fucking destroy you. Now listen to me kill your little bitch fucking girl! Do not-- I'm okay John. What about Alisha? Is she gonna be all right? She's gonna be fine. She's a tough girl. Yeah. Well, she is your kid. Look, it's gonna take a ton of paperwork - to get this mess cleaned up. - Yeah. So, um... in the meantime... Go enjoy your summer. Remember, if you need anything just let me know, all right? Good to see you as always. So, this whole time you had a plan. What do you mean "had a plan"? The training? The martial art? Setting everything up? You know, to be honest, I would've started training you no matter what. But yeah. There was a plan. Hey, love. Damn it, Mark. If you don't stop drinking this shit it's gonna kill you. Yeah. You're right. You know, after all these years, Miriam, chasing this guy, and I make no progress. I mean zero, nothing. I just... Mark. Think about this. You've gotta put the bait out there. Okay? Once he takes the bait, that's when you fucking pounce, you get to kill him. And you protect family. That's what it's all about. - Thanks Miriam. -Yeah. It wasn't all me. You see, Miriam had a lot to do with it as well. But I've gotta tell you something else. What I started, you finished pretty well. I'm not sure what that was. You were doing some snake and crane. What was that? Huh? It's good to have you back. I missed you, Dad. I missed you too.
