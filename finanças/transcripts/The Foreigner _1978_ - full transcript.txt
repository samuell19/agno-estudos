(deep breathing) (engine hums) (dark electronic music) (engine hums) (horn honks) - Want a taxi? (engine hums) Where you going? - To Manhattan, please. - [Driver] Manhattan? - Yes. - [Driver] You in a hurry? - Yes. - [Driver] Nice night. You just fly in? - Yes. - Airport's pretty quiet this time of night. What address are you going to? - Just drive. (moody guitar music) - Hello? - [Driver] Boss, it's me, I picked him up. - Yeah? Okay, where'd you bring him? - [Driver] He got off at Broadway and Halston. I followed him up to Chelsea, he's there now. - Okay, good. Now, Dave, not a word about this foreigner, all right? I'm gonna call a meeting, and that'll be that, all right? - Yeah, sure, Boss, I got it. - Okay. Well, you did good work, thanks a lot. And I'll see you later, all right? - [Dave] So long. - Bye bye. (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) - Hello. - [Foreigner] How did everything go at the airport? - [Man] Well, everything went like it was supposed to. - [Foreigner] And at the hotel? - [Man] No problems, everything's okay. - [Foreigner] So how are things over there? - [Man] The same, but worse, I mean, things are pretty bad. I'm sure glad I'm out. - [Foreigner] Yeah, I can imagine. - [Man] And you? - [Foreigner] Well, things are not so easy here. I have to be very careful. - [Man] Do you think you can still help me? - [Foreigner] Well, I tell you, for the moment it's practically impossible. Police and the underground are constantly harassing us. I'm not in such a hot position, either. But I'll give you the name of a friend who might help you. But be careful. - [Man] Okay. Thanks. - [Foreigner] Is your name still Menace? - [Menace] Yes. - [Foreigner] Okay, good luck and sorry. - [Menace] Okay, I guess I better go, I'll see you. (speaking foreign language) (moody guitar music) - Obstruction and violence. (upbeat punk music) These are The Damned, the song is Fan Club. Mark Fee edits the punk newspaper Sniffin' Glue, but he says even he worries about the violence. - These kids, they can't listen to the music while they're doing that, you know? It's ridiculous. I mean, I used to do it, you know? But not violently like them. We used to friends and that, even when watching the Sex Pistols, but now, I'm scared to go in there. Must be something wrong. (upbeat punk music) - [Reporter] It is a rare punk performance that doesn't wind up with someone hurt or something destroyed, usually for no discernible reason. At this performance by The Damned, fans were having such a good time bashing into each other that they ripped out the ceiling and the electrical wiring. It was the totally mindless action of which punk rockers seem inordinately proud. They can't do anything else, they can destroy. They count it an accomplishment. - It's real, it's part of their everyday experience of fighting with police on the streets, of being thrown out of cafes or clubs because of the way they look. Or their parents being out of work and inflicting violence in a pub on a Saturday night for just the fact that they might be a little drunk. - [Reporter] What seems to worry the British is not that punk rock fans have rejected the older generation's values but that they have rejected all values. They are anti-everything. They will tell you at the drop of a safety pin that they have no future, that society offers them nothing. (horn honks) (distant siren wails) (exotic electronic music) (heels clack) - How's business, Harlow? - Great, just great. I had to turn down three cases this month. You look like you're doing all right. Halston, isn't it? - No, Malcolm McLaren from Sachs. - Who's he? Is this on the up and up? Who are you chumping these days? - Look here, Harlow, you and I have known each other for a long time, and in all the time I've known you you haven't made enough money to buy these shoes. Besides, I got a job for you. - I told you, I'm very busy this month. - Five grand plus expenses busy enough for you? - Well. I guess the Wackens case could wait. Okay, who do I have to kill? - No one. Friend of mine just wants this certain party followed, tailed. You find out where he goes, what he does, who he talks to, and make sure he doesn't leave town. - That sounds pretty easy for five grand, what's the catch? - No catch, it's real simple. That's why we wanted you, sweetheart. - With all your success, I see you haven't lost your charm. - And you haven't lost your sense of humor. Here's 2,500 in advance. You get the rest when we get the info. - Just one thing, Doll. What does this party look like? Where can I find him? I don't wanna know why you want him. Just need something work on. Just the facts. - Here's his mug. He's staying over at the Chelsea Hotel. Call me in two days with your first report. (heels clack) - Some outfit, honey. - [Doll] Thanks. - Just goes to show you can't buy class. - Up yours, Harlow. (Harlow laughs) (dark electronic music) - So anyhow, fellows, uh... I wanna follow this character. In other words, I want one of the Bag be behind him all the time. And, uh, Robin, Robin, show what you've been doing. Can you hold it up? - I'm gonna kill him! - Yes, yes, yes. See, Robin's got the right idea. This foreigner is for the birds. We're going to snip, snip that one, we're going to snip his head off. - All right, snip his head off. - Right, Robin knows nothing. - [Boss] Okay, well, you're dirtying up my apartment. I don't appreciate that, but, uh... (drumming) (murmuring) - You know Harlow? - Yeah. - She's a private dick. - She is? - [Bag] Yeah, she's got her name in the Yellow Pages under private investigator. Why don't we hire her? Why don't we hire her to follow, what's his face? - I thought I already did. - You did? - Yeah. - Good thinking, Boss! Hey. (woman squeals) (drumming) Kramer? I don't care. (thuds) (drumming) (drill buzzes) Oh, thanks for plugging it in. - [Bag] Hey, what does it do? - Well, yeah, so? - [Bag] Do it! - [Bag] Whatever you want, baby (drill buzzes) - She doesn't even need a drill, do ya? Oh, but you do. (drill buzzes) - [Boss] She got the idea I'm all over her. She lay on her belly, her ass forming a gorgeous mound. Oh, my eyes, her thick, dancer thigh put me in very vulnerable and between them the cunt hair peeking out. I put her ass up to her shoulders. - [Bag] Are you talking about the foreigner? - [Boss] Yeah. Yeah, okay. I pull them up to my shoulders and then I leaned forward and exposed the pink slit of her pussy and watch it more fully. I knelt between her legs and pried the cheeks apart, her clenched asshole warned me that... - [Dave] I picked him up, he's not female. - [Boss] Shut up, let me finish, okay. (woman squeals) The tension in the body almost made me... - [Bag] What's going on? (murmuring) - Okay, the tension in her body. Oh, great. Well, she had to be with me though. Those aren't my coffee stains. - But they are. - Well, coffee stains or not, the poor girl had to recuperate and you know, those days were with me. - That's not even coffee, that's... - It's coffee stains. - It's not. - Sure it is. - Yes, it is. - It's coffee stains. - It's not coffee. - It was coffee, ask Kit. (murmuring) - What's that? - It's skin. - No, but we, just get it, blah blah blah. Just to unite because you know, everybody... (moans) (machine whines abrasively) (explosive bangs) (hushed chatter) - Are you Christoff? (man speaks foreign language) Are you Christoff? - Nah. - Ben told me that you could find me a place to stay. - No. (speaks foreign language) (woman speaks foreign language) - Brooklyn? Look I'm sorry I don't understand what you're talking about. (woman speaks foreign language) Do you have a place that I can stay at? (woman speaks foreign language) You don't speak English? (man speaks foreign language) (chatter in foreign language) You don't know how to speak English? (woman speaks foreign language) (chatter in foreign language) (trash can lid thuds) (murmuring) (toy buzzes) (muffled pop music) Are you Ronnie? - [Ronnie] Who are you? - I'm a friend of Klaus who said you might be able to help me. - Help you? (laughs) What do you think I am, Salvation Army? - No, are you a friend of Klaus? - Yeah. Okay. So? - Can't you do anything for me? - Things are not like they used to be. What do you think I would be doing in a joint like this, huh? - You mean there's something more to you? - Sure. What's your name? - Menace. - I like it. - Did you, uh... Did you try to see R? - No, I thought I would try to do without him. - (chuckles) That's what I thought, too. But, um... Didn't work. Hm? - So there's nothing you can do? - No. No. No. I can help you but, listen. - Okay. - No. - Okay, I'll see you later, bye. - [Ronnie] Well, take care, huh? Watch your ass! Good luck! (laughs) (screaming) - [Menace] Are you Shareen? - I don't know. - I'm sorry, I don't understand. - He's not here. - Are you Shareen? (man mumbles) Are you Shareen? - How come you know my name? - I find you name from the file. - What kind of file? I don't give a shit about... - The file. - Look, I'm not involved with this anymore. Are you in LA? - No. - What do you want? - I need a place and I need connections. - I'm telling you, I'm not involved with this anymore. I can't help you. - Look, I'm broke and I need connections. - So is everybody. You're on your own. Get it? - Yeah, I get it. - Listen. Listen. Have you seen R? - No. - Go and see R, that's all I'm telling you. That's all you're getting. - Okay, thanks. (chatter in foreign language) My friends told me to come and see you. They tell me to contact you, they said you could help me. They're all on the watch. - [R] How could I help you? - They told me you could help me. - [R] I don't understand that at all. You mean, I'm supposed to be getting new people coming through here without some notice and some advance notice? - What am I supposed to do? - [R] What are you supposed to do? Where are you found, man? (laughs) I don't know where you're coming from. - What do you mean where I'm from? They sent me over here to contact you 'cause you're supposed to help me. - They sent you to me? - Right. - I don't get anybody with less than six months notice. Don't you realize that? I'm not fucking Grand Central Station. - [Menace] So what the fuck am I supposed to do? - What are you supposed to do? (speaking foreign language) I don't know what you're supposed to do, do what you like. You're on your own. (moody electronic music) (acoustic guitar music) - [Menace] When we dream that we dream, we're beginning to wake up. Bourgeois civilization and all its amenities are a great joke. The dead no not discriminate. A coward cannot be free, a coward cannot lose. A coward cannot win, a coward cannot be. Each man carries... The remain of his birth, slime and eggshell with him to the end. That's how I'm enhanced. Why does this always happen to me? Everywhere I go, someone dies. Every time I find someone, every time I think I've found someone, they die. Why? I don't deserve this. Why did I ever even wind up here? I'm useless to a society of useless. I feel out of place. I walk the streets alone with nobody to talk to. I'm only driven by this eternal defeat. I have nothing to look ahead and nothing to regret. I only have the present. I meet people in the streets. I meet their shadows in the dark, but I can still hear their voices when I sleep. I had nothing before I got here and now I have delusions. I seem to be surrounded by events to which I'm only a spectator. If I die, I (chuckles), I'd like to be buried in a dark cemetery. With the saying, "Here's sleeps a dog "who thought he could make it as a human." Today I walked in front of the light. I didn't even make a shadow. I ate a hot dog and almost died. Crossing the street, a man stuck his hand into my pants, and a drunk was dodging cars until he got hit. A man was lying on his back at the corner of Broadway and 34th Street. He laid there for at least 10 hours. He's probably still there. I walk the streets alone, strangers talk to me. I answer them the best I can and never see them again. I don't eat much, but I walk for miles, trying to find an answer. I'm only responsible for myself. The world seems to be completely oblivious to me. I'm not only very conscious of my oddness, but I'm also conscious of the oddness of this world. I don't believe in too much. I'm so wrapped up into myself that I hardly listen to anything. I scheme over all of the sensation and feelings I have, except the one of being lonely, in which I seem to be taking pleasure. I don't love a single soul in town. The only faces I see are the one of the hotel clerk, and the people in the streets who turn their heads when I pass by and laugh. Nobody really wants to know who I am. I feel like ripping every town I go to, but I'm tired. So I just move. Everybody's just a zombie. Everybody wants to know where I come from, but nobody really wants to know who I am. People say they want to help me. So they give me the names of other people that are helpless themselves. Nobody wants a dirty dog down his basement. I always stay on the outside of town. (water splashes) - [Man] Hi, pal. What's the matter? - What's the matter with what? - [Man] What's the matter with you? - Nothing's the matter with me. - [Man] What're you doing here? (groans) (Menace chuckles) - Don't worry about it! You guys are nuts. - No, hey look. - What? - Sorry. Hey, come here, come here! We're gonna throw you overboard. (moody electronic music) - [Woman] Hot November, isn't it? - What? - I said, it's a hot November, isn't it? - Yes. - That's due to the inversion of the temperature, you know. - The what? - Temperature inversion. Haven't you been watching the clouds? - No. - Well, particles have been falling from the ionosphere all week. - So? - So what's your name? - Max. - Max what? - Max. - Max? How do you do? My name is Leslie Webber. - Hi. - So what do you say we go for a drink? - No, I have things I have to think over, I can't. - Well, you can think and drink at the same time! No. - Yes, you can! - Okay, let's go for a drink. - [Leslie] So, where are you from? - [Max] I'm just passing through. - [Leslie] You're a tourist? - [Max] Yeah, that's right, I'm a traveler. - [Leslie] Oh, I like travelers. So, uh, why this city? - [Max] I had some people to see. - [Leslie] Some friends? - No. - No? Family? - No. - No? Who? - [Max] Never mind. - [Leslie] Oh, how long you been here now? - [Max] A while. - [Leslie] Gonna stay a while? - [Max] I don't know. - [Leslie] Got any money? - [Max] Not much. - [Leslie] Oh. You can hang out here for a while, if you want. (lock clicks) - [Max] Okay. (door slams) (door slams) (footsteps clack) - White socks! I never like anything white. - Why? - [Leslie] I hate it, it disgusts me! - [Max] I hope you don't mind me? - No, you're alright. - You're filthy. I like that. - [Max] Do you want me to take a bath? - No, I told you, I like filth! Hope it rains today. I can't stand it when this city gets all filthy and slimy. Why don't you go take a bath? - Just a minute ago you said you like dirt. - So that was a minute ago. - Look, I'm not gonna play your little games, no, I'm not. - [Leslie] So what're you gonna do? Sit on your ass all day in my house? Because it's my house! - [Max] I'm gonna stay here as long as I want. - Oh, I see you're showing some character now. I like that. Move! (dark electronic music) (door thuds) (key rattles) (dark electronic music) (footsteps clack) (dark electronic music) (footsteps clack) So what the fuck you been doing all day? Sitting on your neat little ass. - Look, I wouldn't mind if you didn't throw the fucking food around. I'd like to have a bite. I haven't had anything to eat in two days. - So? - So I can't get out, there are some dudes watching me all the time. - You're not doing anything about it. You're just sitting here, doing nothing. Read something! - Look. I don't understand, I can't read. (magazine clacks) - So, listen to the radio. - I don't like the radio, it's dumb. - So, watch TV. - I'd like to remind you that you don't have a TV here. - I'm supposed to go out and get you a TV now? - I don't like TV. - I've had just about enough of your "I don't like this, "I don't like that," I'm not an institution. Either you like what I say, or you get the fuck out and shut up! - [Max] I wouldn't mind to get the fuck out. I'd like to go for a walk. - [Leslie] You wanna go for a walk, huh? In New York City, alone? I thought you said some people were following you? - You know, I'm really getting sick of you. I would like to get a fucking key. (Leslie chuckles) - [Leslie] So take it. Take it!
