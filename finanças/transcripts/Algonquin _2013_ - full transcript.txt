The first one to return my private journal gets to go home now. The others will remain here. Mr. Sherman, thank you for coming to your senses. - I don't get it. - Get what? How your tongue on a lady's breast is like 'a dewy caravan travelling down the Silk Road?' I didn't write that, okay? I like how you rhymed 'stadium' with 'labium.' Detention's over, get out. Hey... I'm expecting... Is there a bus coming from Montreal? The 4:30? Okay. Thank you. - Can't a man slake his thirst? - I can't. I'm driving okay. Oh my God, you're mad. - Yeah. - Don't be mad. I waited for you for over an hour at the bus station. I'm sorry. Just sit back and enjoy yourself. Your dad's here now. Oh this is really kind of lame, isn't it? I'll get a fresh one. Ashley! At our beck and call. Ashley, my unmarried son here needs a drink. - Another pitcher, gentlemen? - No, we're fine. You sure? I guess not today. Sorry. Hey, before you go... I've got something for you. I want you to accept this little gift from me to you. - Hey, that's you! - Is it? Of course. Haven't changed a bit, have I? Would you like me to sign it? I'd be happy to. It's Ashley with an "e.y?" That's it! I should put down your phone number. Don't you want to make a right here? Four years away, and you still think you know your way around better than me. I know the quickest way to your mother's house. Well were not going there. We're going to my place first, getting you settled in, and then we're heading over. Nonsense! We'll go there first. How's she doing anyway? She looking pretty good? Still got it I bet. Yeah. She's good. Right. Jake, I told you not to bring home strays. Oh my God. These are for you. - You shouldn't have. - They're fresh picked too. How you doing anyway? - You look good. - Thank you. Oh Junior, could you go and grab my bag from the car? Get that other little one too. - So what's happening? - Nothing. You going to invite me in? There's no smoking inside. I'm not in yet, am I? Wow. You still do have it, don't you? - Stop. - Look how good you look. Okay, that's enough. He's right there. - You okay? - Yeah. Psst! The last thing I spent a lot of time on, I never really got it together. - Did you publish? - No. I never got to that point. Got an advance out of them. Should have got more. - Are you happy? - I'm happy right now. You're teaching now? He's been teaching for three years! Are you serious? How do you even do it? He loves it. He's a whiz with those kids. I hate it. Well, you're making a real difference with those guys. Yeah, right. Is that true? You making a big difference? Immeasurable. Well, I think it's time now that I reveal to you the true reason for my little home-coming this time. You need money. Not so fast, you... But yeah. Jake, my boy, I really need your help. The cabin! Look... Look at the physique on that guy! I really had it going on then. Well, so? What do you think? You've got a lot of nerve, dredging up all this stuff. What are you talking about? Those are some good times right there. What do you mean nerve? They weren't all great times. All right, Jake, I've been very lucky. I've been fortunate enough to go all around the world. And I've done it through my writing. Of course, you know that better than anybody. But I've never had a chance to write about what I really want to write about. Which is this place. Our place. And now it appears that... I'm going to get my chance, 'cause I got a book contract. - You do? - I do. - Really. - Yeah. - What, so you're back? - Never left. Believe it. And I want you part of it, Jake. I want you, I need you to come with me. I really believe that with you as my co-pilot there isn't anything we can't accomplish. You and me together. Dad, I just not the adventurous type, okay? I get it! This kid of yours, he's pretty clever. Not too slow on the up-take. Okay. I was going to give in later, but... Co-author. You get co-credit. Dad, it's not even about that, it's just... When do you expect to do this? I have to do it right now! I just told you. - Well then, no, absolutely not. - Why not? - I can't. - Can't! - I have a full class schedule. - Just phone in sick. Take your little sabbatical or something. Tell them your father died. That'll work. It doesn't really matter. What matters is that we get a chance - you and I- to write this book. Dad. I can't. What am I going to do with this this molly-coddled kid? - He's just being responsible. - What? Responsible. Like a normal person. He's got his ambition drained out of him. - No he's doesn't. - Okay, okay, okay. I've got a couple sick days coming to me. I'll just... I can take two days. I'll help you get set up, and then I'm out of there. Okay? All right? Mom, what do you think? I think we should have never left the park. You have no rhythm. No, let me start again. Okay, starting... now! Oh, we just spilled. - Jesus. - You are so drunk. Could've hurt. At least I would have landed on you. Listen, there is something I really gotta tell you. Shhh! Shut up! Just let me tell you... - Mornin'. - Morning, son. Is Mom awake? Let's give Lady Chatterley her space this morning, okay? What did you do? Just leave it alone, okay? We've got a lot to do today. There you are. Look at this. - Poprocks? - They're good. What are you, twelve? They're good. Leave me alone. You baffle me. Baffle you? Why are you such a smart ass? Is that how I raised you? Yeah right, you raised me. Okay, your mother had a firm hand in there as well. I don't want you coming here and messing with her, alright? Come here messing with her? What are you talking about? Just go get the crackers. We need them cheap and salted. - No. - What? Get them yourself for Christsake. Get them myself? Wow. So is this the hill you want to die on? Is it? Get the crackers junior. Thank you. My God. What's this? Rice Krispie squares? What are you, twelve? Hey Mom, it's me. Can I come in? - Is he with you? - No. - Yeah. - Then forget it. Just tell her we need the garage open. Can you just please open the garage door for us? No. For you. For you! For me. Please? Mom? Mercy. Oh yeah! Aw, just look at her. She's a glory. This is the belle of the ball. You know what? There is no other vehicle I would trust this mission with. Okay? Let's get her out of here. Yeah. - Would you not? - I haven't said anything. You don't have to. This vehicle, she's got something no other vehicle has. - Know what that is? - What? It's a little thing called soul. Yeah, how about an engine? It's in surprisingly great shape. Huh? Yeah. Thank you. That one's for you. Moment of truth. Fire her up there, son. - What? - Just... Hold on. Let's just pause for a second. Everything's perfect right now. I want to enjoy it. No. Gas. Okay we got it this time. Don't leave me hanging! Okay. Never had a doubt. Hey, that's not going to help! - Let's see. - Jesus. See? Go make your good-byes. I'll wait right here. Pick it up. Snappy. - What's this? - Banana loaf. - Don't give him any. - I won't. Look mom, if you want me to stay, say the word. No no you go. It's screwed up, but it's important. - Yeah. - C'mere. Be safe. Both of you. Yeah we will. I'll give you a call when we get there. Bye Mom. - Oh my God. - What? It's here. Oh my god. Isn't it great? - Can you here that sound? - What? You know what that's the sound of? That is the sound of beginnings. We're slowly finding our way in. All the ideas right now are so random and disconnected. But we're going to bring order to this chaos. - How are we going to do that? - We're going to go to work. This is the start of your apprenticeship. You realize that, don't you? Is that what you did for your last book? I'll tell ya, each book's different. Each one teaches you something different about yourself. What did you learn on the last one? I learned that I gotta negotiate a better advance. Those bastards totally ripped me off. The publisher buried it. There was some rumour going around that I was sleeping with his wife. He is a total prick. Even she said so. I told you that Warren Beatty wanted to option it right? I didn't? Yeah, he was all over it. He said he thought the work was genius. That I was a genius. Warren Beatty doesn't throw that word around lightly. He knows what he's talking about. The whole thing was all lined up... - Could you check the oil? - That's what I'm doing. You know how to check the oil? With a dip-stick? Hey! Como estas? Yeah... So what's our approach going to be on the book? Whoa. Keep your voice down. You don't know who's listening. I'm serious. Do you even know how many of my ideas have been stolen? I guess not... It's true. You got to be careful. You don't know what we're sitting on here, obviously. This isn't going to be some run-of-the-mill expose. Some wankerish thought-piece. We're writing the biography of this place. This place. That's our main character. We've got to bring that to life. And, if we accomplish that, it will be powerful. It will be elemental. It will be... undeniable. Listening pretty good, aren't you? That's nice. Why don't you just drink your Mountain Dew and just mind your own God damn business. C'mon. Let's go. What are you reading anyway? Tom Sawyer? Dad! Come on! I'm sorry. - Want a hand? - No, I'm good. - Here. - Thanks. Wow, there she is. You remember this place? I do. This is amazing. - Is it condemned? - What's it say? Notice of Dereliction. Agh! Geordie Oliver. He's an idiot. He hasn't got the stones to deal with me. - God, you scared me. - I just tripped. This place is a ruin. "Where there is ruin, there is hope for a treasure." That's Rumi. Actually, it's kind of cluttered. Smell that? What's that smell? I think some animal made themselves at home in here. I want you to go check that bedroom, okay? Shh. Go check it. Fear teaches you who you are. Terror is a self-awareness opportunity. Go find yourself. Go on, I'm right behind you. - Ah! - Jesus. It's okay, I thought I heard something. - Don't do that. - Careful. - Ah! God damn it! - What was it? Something scuttled under the corner there. - Go check it out. - God. - Oh, yeah. - It scared the crap out of me. I would have been more surprised if there was nothing here. Know what I mean? Okay no problem. Won't come back now. We'll plug that tomorrow. Give me a hand and we'll get some shut eye. - I'm sleeping on the couch. - Really? Alright, good enough. Beunas Noches a mi Hijo. Shouldn't you take it easy? I feel great. I feel like I'm twenty years old! Here, take over, would you? Just got a little dizzy there. - You alright? - A hundred percent. You sure your hands aren't too soft? Girls don't like men with soft hands, mama's boys. Rough hands. That's your secret, huh? You're a little bit too single to be taking shots at me, aren't you junior? Are ya? Give me the axe. I can't stand this anymore. Back off. - Give me the axe. - I got it! You have absolutely no clue about my life. What? Not about anything that actually matters anyway. Where's this coming from? That's what happens when you walk out on your fucking family. You don't have to be so dramatic. I came home plenty of times. Didn't I? - Yeah. - So? Your little visits were really cherished memories. You know, when you grow up and become an adult, things tend to get a little more complicated. It's not always kid's stuff. Get me? Actually it's appallingly simple. You care about yourself. That's the only person you've actually ever cared about. Sound about right? You don't leave an axe like that. Come back here. Why do you have to ruin everything? Sorry. "Tonight I'm yours. Xox Rita" Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Wake up! Come on, wake up! Dad... I'd... I'd just like to say a few words. As I'm sure you all know, my father loved Thoreau. He'd quote Walden, saying "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, and to front the essential facts of life." But to tell you the truth, the essential facts of my father's life remain a mystery to me. Sometimes I think he wasn't never really meant for me at all. He was meant for his readers. But it was my mother... who had a very special bond with him, one that was unique and without peer. She gave him a family life. A home. She alone was his confidante and companion. And that can never be taken away from her. He'll be missed. Thank you for coming. Yes, thank you. Hi. I'm fine. Thank you. - You okay? - Yeah. You're doing great. Excuse me. I... I knew your father. I am very sorry for your loss. - Thank you... - Carmen. Jake. Excuse me. I'm sorry. This has been very hard on her. I understand. I saw you with your son? Yes. He's... It's okay. Can I ask how you know my father? Sure, but you have many people to speak with today. Thanks. Jake. Bill Lish. - I was your father's editor. - Yes, of course. - Condolences. - Thank you Mr. Lish. He spoke of you often... - Back for more? - Yeah. Can't believe you kept all his stuff all these years. It was our stuff. You know I never really could figure out your relationship with him. Well, it wasn't yours to figure out. Where was that? That was on our canoe trip. - Our last trip together. - Right. The last one. Look at you! Oh my gosh, you were so cute. Oh wow. What's wrong? You see that? It's upside down. Yeah I see it. So? Ever since that trip, everything has gone down hill for our family. Don't be silly. We were fine. Mom, we were far from being fine, okay. I'm going to go back there and I'm going to finish that book. It's what Leif would have wanted. Dad! Hey is anyone there? Hey kid! Hey! Jake. Hi. Hi. There was no one home so we just... - It's... - Carmen. Carmen. Yeah. Of course. Iggy. Say hi. I think it's time you two met. I'm Jake. Pero qué maneras son es as? Sorry. No it's okay, really. I hope I didn't scare you back there. You caught me off guard. Iggy. Jake is speaking to you. Now what do you have to say to your brother? What happened to your forehead? Ow! You like it? Yeah, it's really terrific. It's the least we could do. We've intruded. No. I just wasn't expecting anyone. I understand. We had no idea anyone would be here. It was early on in the project when it happened, so... The project. What project? Well, the book. On Algonquin. We were writing it together. Hm, he didn't mention it. Really? That's... I'm sorry, I don't understand. It was a really big deal to him. He didn't talk about that stuff. That 'stuff' was his life. Not to us it wasn't. I'm sorry. I've offended. No, it's okay. It's just that's not who he was with us. He was a normal guy. A funny guy. I'm sorry. I find it hard to believe we're talking about the same person. La cena aun no termina. Quiero mirar las estrallas. Portate bien. So... You were with my father for... For ten years. So tell me about the book. It was his grandfather's, my great-grandfather's cabin. One of the last ones actually. I'm amazed you were able to find it. He left us a map when he left us the property. He what? Wait... Dad? Dad? That son-of-a-bitch. This cabin has been in our family for generations! - I understand, we... - No no no. Jake, I don't know what to say. Let's just not say anything for now, okay? Okay. Iggy? Iggy? Iggy! Just wait here, I'll check the boats. Iggy! The boats are still here. He's couldn't have gone far. It's okay, I'm sure he's fine... No it's not okay. It's my son, it's not okay. Iggy! I'll get some flashlights. Just don't go far. Iggy! Iggy! Iggy! Iggy, come on buddy! Talk to us! Iggy! Iggy! Iggy! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! - You're hurt? - I fell. It wasn't him. He's finally asleep. What's this? Just packing up. Why? This whole thing isn't working for me. Leif tried to pull this with me once. Didn't work out so well for him. Yeah, well I'm not my father. And things have changed. You want me to sign over the deed. Is that going to fix things for you? I envy you, it must be nice to be such a victim. Hold on - you come here and think you know me? Jake, I just want you to like me. To like my boy. So this is hard for me to say but you're messing things up. Aw, come on, I don't need this. You think I'm not hurting? You think my boy is not torn up? He lost his father. Just like you. You could be something for him. I'm not sure he wants that. I think you're wrong. Hey. I remember that. How's your wrist doing? Hey, you want to know how I got this scar? Okay. I'll tell you. It was our father who did it to me. He beat you? No. God no. Oh. He threw a horse-shoe at my forehead. Really? Yeah. It was an accident. We were on a canoe trip together. Our last together actually. I was about your age. Just a father and son in his canoe... For three days and three nights. Yeah. Actually. Anyway. We set out before dawn. It had rained the night before. I remember because our boots got soaked even before we left... But the boy and his father set out, paddling against strong winds, feeding their bellies with the fish they caught along the way. Each night they played competitive games of horseshoe. On their last night a horseshoe was tossed and struck the father in the head. Though he bled, he was declared the victor of the games. Lucky him. He told you that? Yeah, every night before I went to sleep. Well, he lied. He hit me. Son-of-a-bitch. I can't believe he'd say that. What do you think? Good story. Yeah. Good story. This is not the most comfortable place to sleep. I'm a ruin. But where there is ruin there is... hope for treasure. I'm going to find that horseshoe. It'll be great for the book. You know what, you want to try one? No, it's fine. C'mon, it'll make a man out of you. There you go. Get another piece and try again. Okay... Here, this one's good. - You guys are working hard. - Hey. - Yep. Thanks. - Thank you. For what? He seems to have really taken to you. - You think so? - Definitely. Yeah, well, give him some time; he'll change his mind. I'm going for a walk. You mind keeping an eye on him a little longer? - Of course. - Okay. Okay, so you go from Grand Lake to St. Andrews Lake. There are two portages. Not long. But the second one's tricky. Once you get to the campsite, it's pretty but exposed to the wind. So be sure to bring a tarp. - You're bluffing, right? - Maybe. So let me get this straight. You can actually lead me to the horseshoe? You actually had me going there for a second. You're good. I'll teach you poker sometime. - Suit yourself. - I will. Come on. What would you rather be? Would you rather be a frog or a snake? Snake. They're slimier. Snakes are slimier? No frogs are slimier. No snakes are. And they don't have any legs. - You prefer to have no legs? - Yeah. It would be cool to just, like... Slither around? Alright you do one. Would you rather be a house or would you rather be... No never mind. Would you rather be a coyote or a werewolf? Hmmm. Werewolf. - I would be a coyote. - Why would you be a coyote? They just look cooler than werewolves. - Really? - Yeah. Here this one's for you. Thanks. Careful. It's hot. Last one. Then it's bed. It's good? Give me a kiss. What? Too old to give your mother a kiss? - He'll come around eventually. - I know. You doing okay? - You? - I dunno. I almost too numb to feel, you know. Yeah. You want some more? Sure. What's this? Oh, it's just... What happened? Come, I'll fix you up inside. Alright. - Oh God. - Courage, now. Thank you. It's, um... It's good that you're here. Well I do it for Iggy. I have to be strong for him. Hold still. I really appreciate it. It's going to be useful on my trip tomorrow. Yeah, Iggy mentioned that trip. Yeah. I'm... I'm going off into the middle of nowhere to try to find this thing that's been out there for a long time. This thing? What's this thing? It's a... It's a horseshoe. - Uh, like... - Yep. It's nailed to a tree somewhere. I have no idea where it is. - You don't know where it is? - No. It's crazy. It's crazy, I know. But I'm going to find it. I'm going to find it. No, c'mon, it's beautiful. Yeah? Yes, I hope you find it. Maybe you need a kiss for good luck. Okay. How's your hand? This... This is... I know. It's crazy. Uh... Uh-uh. No. Can you hear me? You're not coming, Iggy. Okay, this is not going to work. Okay, I promise we can do this another time. Just not on this trip, okay? I'm coming with you. No you're not. This is not up to you. Besides, your mother would never approve. She said I can. I highly doubt that. Mom, can I? See? Okay, come on. Let's go. Unbelievable. Wave goodbye to your mother. All right, steady now. You're setting the pace. There you go. You sleep well? - Why? - No reason. Just... Big day is all. Yeah. I slept okay. Good. That's good. Dad? Iggy! Come on, man! Alright, put your stuff in the back. So, we just came from here. And I'm pretty sure that's about five and a half hours to get from here to this point, straight paddling. What do you think? The way dad told it, "It was six to the stones and sticks." - But I'm not sure myself. - That's alright. I'm sure that between you and this map, we'll be fine. Let's take this down to the water. Iggy look, I think I see an eagle. Where? Right up on the second pine from the shore. That really tall one. - You see it? - I see the tree. - Oh yeah, I see him! - Is it an eagle? I think so. Yeah, it's an eagle. Oh there he goes. You think that was Dad? Maybe. What do you think? I don't know. Do you believe in that stuff? - Like... - Like when people die. Do they come back as something else? Uh, reincarnation. Reincarnation. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. I think he's here... but I don't think that was him. He's not an eagle. What do you think he is? I don't know. Something not an eagle. Well we should keep our eyes out for him. Okay. Um... Jake? Yeah? Hi. How you doing? Are you aware of the fire ban currently in effect? Uh... Sorry. No, I wasn't... Don't say sorry to me. Say sorry to the park. To these trees. We'll just put it out right away. You'll have no problems from us. I'm afraid it's too late for that. Going to need your last name. Come on, is this really necessary? Name. It's Jake... Roulette. Roulette? Where you boys coming from? Just about 8 miles down the lake. You can't be serious. 500 dollars? You pitched your tent outside the designated area. There's a designated area? A safe and orderly residence - permanent or otherwise - is a sign of respect for your environment. Would you agree, sir? Ok, sure... I'm sorry, am I missing something here? I took the opportunity to inspect your watercraft. You have no bail bucket. - A bail bucket? - It's regulation, son. - We'll just get a bucket. - Again, too late for that. I'm afraid I'm going to have to seize your canoe. You must be joking. Water safety is not a joking matter. Buddy, I'm not laughing. But this whole thing is... Good. You 'ought now to gather your belongin's. Can you believe that? What a tool. What's a matter mister? Engine won't start? Well, that smells interesting. What's in it? - Ketchup packs. - I see. So, since you're enjoying the hospitality, you think maybe you could let that ticket slide? I'm afraid I can't do that. Regulations are regulations. - So what about this fire? - What fire? So, your last name's Roulette? Well let me tell you something, Roulette, I think your cabin's a disgrace. It's a hazard and a blight on the entire park. Yeah. I think I got your little note about that. Well, if it was up to me, it'd be torn down. Well it's been in the family a long time. Your old man should take care of his stuff. It's getting late. So it is. We'll try this again tomorrow. 'Night, boys. Good night. 'Night. You believe that guy? I want to poke him with a stick. Hello? Woohoo! Made it! Wait... Damn it. This isn't good. What is it? I left my notebook back there. It has all my notes in it. It has the map. Shit. Well is that going to help us find dad? Why the hell would I want to see him? Hey, what are you doing? Give me that. I think this trip is over pal. No! Iggy, with no map, and the situation being what it is, maybe it's smarter we go back, cut our losses. I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Get back. Get back. It's your notebook. You're sure you saw it? It's your notebook. I swear. Okay, Iggy, I'm going to loop around, go to the boat, get the notebook, and come right back. You need to promise me that you will stay right here. If you hear or see anything, blow this whistle okay? Okay. I'll be right back. I promise. Well it's about time you phoned your mother... Hello? Who is this? It's you, isn't it? Yes. It's Carmen. So are you enjoying our cabin? Can I speak with Jake? He's on a canoe trip. With my son. Is he? Since I found out, I've told you off a thousand times. Now I'm not sure what to say. Rita, I'm sorry. Believe me. There were others. But you're different. And that's what hurts. I loved him. Me too. Except when I was hating him. Are you alright? Yeah. Iggy! Iggy! Iggy! Shit. Iggy! Iggy! Jake! Iggy! Iggy! Hey! Hey! - Whoa! Whoa! - Not another step. This has gone way over the line. You're the one whose gone over the line. - Keep your hands up. - Okay, just take it easy. Put that thing down. The minute I take it easy, this park is put in jeopardy by people like you. You have flaunted park bi-laws and unlawfully fled an officer of the park. That makes you boys fugitives. Look, I want to lower the temperature here for a second. I'm going to calmly put down my hands, okay? Slowly. Good. Now we can talk. So talk. I would like it very much if my brother could just come here now, is that okay? No! Okay. Geordie... Sir. Let me appeal to you man to man, okay? Here's the situation. I think you know my father. Yeah I do. Okay, well my father - our father - he recently died, see. And my brother and I are on this trip to, well, to honour him. Okay? Okay. So I'm appealing to your humanity, to our mutual love of this place, and the honour of my father to please just... please let us go. Nope. Hey Geordie, just think about the cabin for a second. That awful, disgusting sight. The busted soffits. The broken shingles. The ripped screen door. I'll fix it all. Each and every one. And the fire pit. I'll move it so that it complies with regulation. And I will replace the down-spout. Go on... I will buy a rain barrel. And in the spring I'll plant saplings to off-set our footprint. Be sure to plant those saplings two feet apart at least. Of course. You have my word. Okay. You two can get out of here. But I'm watching you. Thank you. So you going to do any of that stuff? Or face the ranger's wrath? Oh, hey, I've got something for you. My Pop-Rocks! Anything to keep you from talking. Mmmm. I love these things. I know. What? I just... I remember this, that's all. - For real? - I do. Cool. How's it feel? You like your fish? Not bad. Tastes like chicken. No it doesn't. - Can I ask you something? - Go ahead. When did you become a writer like dad? Oh, I'm not a writer. You're not? No, the only thing I've written were lesson plans. And, well, the occasional bad poem. - Oh. - Yeah. I mean I always wanted to be a writer but I just never did. Why not? I guess... I guess I thought I could never measure up to the old man. Too much competition. You wanted to compete with him? He's your dad. Yeah, well, things change when you get older. See, I don't get it. For me, he was just always there. Up when I'd wake up. Making breakfast. Walking me to school. Kicking the ball with me. Reading to me. Everything. Wow. That's... That's hard for me to imagine actually. When he left, I thought he didn't want to be with me anymore. Yeah. - Hey, you want some more? - Yeah, thanks. Look at that. Do you remember this? I've dreamt about it. I don't care about the cabin. I feel lucky just to be here. You can use it anytime you want. Look, Iggy, I'm not bagging on you. Honest. Iggy! Iggy, wait... It's just that you're a kid, and I don't expect you to fully understand this, but... This place is my childhood. I'm mean it's just a bunch of bed-time stories to you. - There's a difference. - He's my father too! Iggy, come on... I'm not saying he wasn't. Yeah well, have your stupid cabin back. Maybe that's all you care about. Iggy... Iggy... I'm sorry. Really. Yeah well, you're forgiven. Do something for me? Anything. Just be my brother. Okay. - And another thing? - What? Don't kiss my mom. I don't like it. I won't... Anymore, okay? I promise. Iggy look. Can you believe it? We found it. Iggy, look. Iggy... I hate it! It's not fair! I hate that thing! Calm down! Why do you hate it? Because it's not him, okay? It's not him. Listen to me. Fucking listen to me okay 'cause this is important. - He's gone. - He's not. He's gone and he's not coming back... - He is... - And it sucks. No. He is not coming back. But that is not going to define you. Do you understand me? This is not going to ruin your life. You cannot do what I did. You can't shut down. Stop caring. I'm not him, but I'm not going to let that happen. Do you hear me? I won't let it. A little to the left. Whoa. Perfect. Alright, smile. I'm not a smiler. Let's get out of here. - Race you to the canoe? - I'm not a runner. Hey! No fair! Woohoo! We made it! Iggy! I missed you! I hope he didn't cause you too much trouble. - No, I didn't. - How did it go? It was great. Iggy will tell you all about it. You two must be hungry. Wow, it sure is clean. I took regular breaks from worrying by scrubbing everything. Well, the solitary thing isn't for everybody. No, not for me, anyway. Is it good? Did you miss me? Hey pal, what's going on? Mom says that we're leaving tomorrow. Well, your mother knows what's best for you. So don't give her any grief, okay? - You hear? - I hear. Good. Sorry we didn't get to talk. No, no, it's okay. Really, don't worry about it. We'll see you again? Of course. - So, we're okay? - Yeah. Take care. Will I see you next summer? Sooner. Okay. - Hi! You scared me. - You miss me? Sorry. Oh my goodness, yes. You're home. Yay. I'm so glad. How was it? It was great. Yeah, I'll tell you all about it. Well, look at you. Your father's son. - I don't know about that. - You want me to read it? Oh, god, it's hash right now. It always is. It was no different with your father. Don't believe the myth. - Really? - Yes. But you could get a hold of your father's editor. Tell him where you're at with it. - I think I might, actually. - Good. So, tell me about your trip. There's not a whole lot to tell. Wow! Yeah, we found it. - That's amazing. - I know, isn't it? How's the boy doing? I think he's going to be okay. Good. I'm going to make up your bed. Hey mom? - How do you do it? - Do what? Just keep it together all the time? It's just what we do. Jake, it's Bill Lish returning. Thanks for your call. I must say it came as some surprise. Your father and I worked together closely for many years. But he never mentioned this project to me. I hate to leave this on a recorded message, Jake, but I owe it to you to be frank: there is no current book contract between us and your father. I am sorry. I wish you well with the project. Goodbye.
