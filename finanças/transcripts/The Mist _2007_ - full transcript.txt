That's what we get for not fixing that roof when we should've, but with funds being cut every year You'd think educating children would be more of a priority in this country, but you’d be wrong Government's got better things to spend our money on, like corporate handouts and building bombs Daddy, is there a fire?

Let me look at you Hmm? Wanna lie down? Yeah There you go Soon as it blows away, we can walk out of here safe andfree, but we have to be smart about it First thing we need to do is keep our wits about us and find out what’s happened Well, how we gonna do that, my man? We've got no phone signal, got no radio I'm sure they're working on those problems as we speak It stands to reason that restoring communications would be their top priority Jeez! Oh, shit. Ow! Shit! God damn it! Ow! Ow! Bitch! It's obvious that we’re... we're in some kind of natural disaster here Ain't nothin' obvious about this sombitch from where I sit There ain't nothin' natural about it either That's right It's Judgment Day, and it's come round at last There is nothing more obvious or natural than that Ohh, fuck, now You've done that to yourself, by a life of sin and dissolution Hey, whoa! David! Hey, you guys hear that? The generator? We're just gonna check it out No, no, I turned the generator off It... it was backing up - N-nobody else heard that sound? - What sound? I don't know, like a weird noise, back there in the dark Like something was, like, pressing against the door Did you hear it before the lights went out, or after? No, only after After, but, look, I heard it, okay? - Nobody's calling you a liar - That's what it sounds like No, no, no, no Now, don't be that away, Mr Drayton on You had a scare, no doubt What say we all go check it out?

Those of you who want to discuss this thing rationally to find a means of rescue are welcome to join me Those who want to stack dog food, knock yourselves out We got those windows taped up as best we could It should help Yeah, think so? Duct tape and dog food bags That bad? It's not good There's none so blind as those who will not see Open your eyes Let the scales fall away This has all been written Revelations, chapter 15: "And the temple was filled with smoke "from the glory of God "and from his power, "and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed" Well, what are you saying? What are you proposing? That we all prepare to meet our Maker Oh, prepare to meet shit! Lady, your tongue must be hung in the middle so that it can waggle at both ends The end time has come, not in flames, but in mist Come here! Easy! Back off! How about if your ass prepares to meet my size-10 work boot How about that? Hey, there's no call for that Myron, please, calm your friend down I'm trying to save your soul, you stupid man - Doubters will doubt till the end - It's okay No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry A monstrosity did pull that poor boy away Things in the mist... do you doubt?

Then go out Go out and say, "How do you do" Shut up, lady For God's sakes Look, you’ll have to stop now You're scaring the children They should be scared Oh, yes, they should Their beautiful, pure little minds have been corrupted with lies Lies All this talk of a modern God, or no God There is one God The God of the Israelites And he is a stern and vengeful God, and we have been mocking him far too long, and now he demands retribution in blood It is time to declare yourselves Take sides... the saved and the damned Read the Good Book It calls for expiation - Blood! - What? Blood Little Normie was first, and now God calls the rest of us The bill is due It must be paid As Abraham prepared to sacrifice his only son to prove his love for God, so... Enough - Ohh - Another down payment A few more pennies in the jar Now, that's nice, see I can't smack her, but it's okay for you I- I'm sorry every body, but this lady's perspective is a little too Old Testament for my taste They'll come for you Maybe tonight, when darkness comes They'll come tonight, and they'll take someone else See if they don't And when they do, you will cry to God, and you will beg Mother Carmody to show you the way That's fine But until then, if you don't shut up, I'll wrap this tape around your mouth You just try it, Ollie Weeks And you, bitch you hit me again if you dare You'll be on your knees to me before this is through Those of you who aren't local should know that Mrs Carmody is known in town for being unstable No shit What was your first clue?

Here? No Please This... this isn't Los Angeles I've got a shotgun in my truck I could try for it if you want Oh, God, I don't think that'd be a good idea, Mr Cornell Hold on This gun, um my husband's idea He's away on business a lot It's not even loaded Ain't much use unloaded, ma'am Um You know how to use that?

What, and let you keep on talking? No, I've been in far too many courtrooms to fall for that You've already psyched out half a dozen of my people already Your people? What kind of talk is that? They're people, that's all Now... now listen, every one We are experiencing some kind of disaster I don't know whether it's manmade or natural, but I do know that it's definitely not supernatural or biblical, and, no offense, Mrs Carmody, but the only way we're gonna help ourselves is to seek rescue We're going out - Brent, look - I'm not discussing this any further I know I just want to ask a favor Tie this around your waist What for? It'll let us know you got at least 300 feet I'll do it Are you throwing in with them? Me?

It's Joe We don't get him on some serious antibiotics, he's gonna die of infection Plus he needs painkillers in the worst way All... all... all we got here is liquor and aspirin You... you thinkin' about goin' to that pharmacy next door? Irene Reppler say they've got Silvadene... you know, the stuff they use in burn wards She knows where they keep it Slow down You can't actually be thinkin' of doin' this I'm also thinkin' beyond that We have to get out of here I mean permanently. Why? We got plenty to eat! What happens when one of those things decides to break through this window? I'm talkin' one of the big ones, like the one that killed Norm Yeah, and that flaming torch idea didn’t work so well, did it? We almost burned the goddamn store down It's Hattie Here? All right, gently, now Gently One two three I don't know how long she was there like that, lying there next to us I thought she was sleeping I got my 4-wheel drive It's out there Y- you’re talking about leaving? Well, we should hit the pharmacy first We gotta bring back supplies for the injured I mean, if we don't, Joe Eagleton's gonna die, and we can't let that happen But after that look, my Land Cruiser can hold eight people I say we drive south as far as the fuel takes us and try to get clear of this mist That's it? That's the plan? - That's what I got - No, you can't mean it Not after what happened to Norton and his group No, no, no Amanda, think. Norton got over 200 feet from this store That's how much rope play ed out I'm parked half that distance from here But who knows how far this mist has spread? It could be the entire eastern seaboard Yeah, it could be the whole world, for all we know Wouldn't make us any less dead, now, would it? We have one gun - How many rounds? We got ten left Ten rounds Jesus Okay, so ten Want another reason to get the hell out of here? I'll give you the best one Her Mrs Carmody She's our very own Jim Jones I'd like to leave before people start drinking the Kool-Aid He's right Flakier people get, the better she's gonna look No, I don't buy that It's obvious she's nuts Look, a few people maybe, but... No, I count four She's preachin' to 'em right now By noon, she'll have four more By tomorrow night, when those things come back, she'll have a congregation, and then we can start worryin' about who she's gonna sacrifice to make it all better Hmm? You, Amanda? My little boy? He's right You don't have much faith in humanity, do you? None whatsoever I can't accept that People are basically good, decent My God, David, we're a civilized society Sure, as long as the machines are workin' And you can dial 9-1-1, but you take those things away, you throw people in the dark, you scare the shit out of them, no more rules, You’ll see how primitive they get You scare people badly enough, you can get 'em to do anything They'll turn to whoever promises a solution, or whatever. Ollie, please, back me up here I wish I could As a species, we're fundamentally insane Put more than two of us in a room, we pick sides and start dreaming up reasons to kill one another Why do you think we invented politics and religion? Oh, Jesus, that's just wrong Look, nobody has to decide anything now, okay? First things first... the pharmacy That'll be our test run Okay? It's all right, Big Bill I'm gonna bring you back some comic books I don’t want them I want you to stay here I won't be gone long Just... just next door Hey, you’ll be safe Daddy... Daddy, there are things out there Things... Yeah There's a lot less of 'em in the daytime They'll wait They'll wait in the mist where you can't see 'em, and then when you go and can't get back in they'll come and eat you up! - Shh - Daddy, don't go! I'll be back Big Bill I promise I'll be back, and then I'm gonna take you home All right? Together, we're going home If something happens, anything at all, you cut and run You get your ass back in here, for your boy's sake If something happens to me, I want you to take care of Billy best as you can, and long as you can Land Cruiser's yours now You... you get him out of here You just keep drivin' Where do you think you’re going, Mr David Drayton on?

Lady, this what you call '"well enough"? You wanna stop us? You better explain to Bobby here why we're not bringin' painkillers and medicine back for his brother I'm goin', even if I have to go alone You'll die out there, young man You'll walk out that door and be torn to shreds, and then your hell-bound pride will have them come get the rest of us Yes, they'll come back for all of us, just like this good lady said Do you want that to happen, people?
