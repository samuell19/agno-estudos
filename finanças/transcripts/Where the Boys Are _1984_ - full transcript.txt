(dramatic music) (bell tolling) (uptempo harmonizing music) (moaning) (breathing heavily) - Oh, that was so good. Almost five years, just keeps getting better, you know, Carole? Carole? - I think we need separate vacations. - What? You've been talking to those girlfriends of yours, haven't you? - No. I've got a mind of my own. - Well, what about the ski trip? I mean, we've been planning it all semester. - I know, but I really think that separate vacations would strengthen our relationship. - And just where we you planning on spending this separate vacation of yours? - Fort Lauderdale. - Fort Lauderdale? (uptempo tech music) - [Sandra] Hot rollers, roomie dear, were not made for re-heating pizza. - You didn't like that, huh? - [Sandra] I knew I shoulda started packing last week. - Sandra, we're going to Fort Lauderdale for 10 days. All you need is a bikini and a diaphragm. - I'm not going to Fort Lauderdale. I am going to Bermuda. Fort Lauderdale is a zoo. It's full of millions of guys who are just looking for animal sex and debauchery. - Exactly, that's why we're going. - Oh, grow up. - You grow up. Sandra, the four of us could have a great time down there. Besides, your cousin Camden will be there. You know what it would mean to Jennie to meet him. - Camden? He's got the personality of a cement block. - Who cares as long as it makes Jennie happy. - Okay, I will drive down there with you and I will spend the weekend with you, but that is all. Then I am going to Bermuda. And just to show you how nice I am, you can use my car. - Thanks. - Which is probably the only reason why you want me to go in the first place. (classical music) - Hey, how'd it go? - [Carole] I told him and he handled it very well. - How well? - He wanted to kill me. - It's pretty well considering. - So, it's Fort Lauderdale, here we come. - I don't think I can go. - What? And what about you? - [Carole] Oh, I'm okay, I'm going. - Jennie, thinking has nothing to do with it. We're talking 10 days in Sodom and Gomorrah. How can you back out now? - Because I have a term paper due in two weeks and I haven't even started yet. I'm not like you, Laurie. You don't crack a book and you make straight A's. - Listen, darlin'. If I can go spend three days in Fort Lauderdale, which is out of my element, so can you. Besides, how are you gonna go meet my famous cousin, Camden Roxbury, though he be a weenie among men. - Prick. - Weenie. - It's all the same. - I don't get it. What's this got to do with Camden? - He is going to be in Fort Lauderdale. He is doing a benefit concert that my Aunt Barbara is sponsoring. So, as long as he's gonna be there, why don't you come meet him? - Oh, I wanna go so bad, I just have so much work to do. - [Laurie] Bring your books and you'll study. - When you're not lusting after Camden. - [Laurie] You can do both. - You're right, I can do both. - So? - We're outta here.

It's my sixth year in a row down here. - [Laurie] Really? - Yeah, and the reason I come to Lauderdale every spring is to make my fortune so I can continue being a part-time student. - When did you drop out of school? - Oh, about two years ago.

Listen, dollface, if you need anything, extra soap, more towels, a nude hot oil massage, feel free to call me. - [Carole] Gimme that key, creep. - [Sandra] No boutique.

He's probably drinking it as we speak. - There's no hot water. In fact, there's no water at all. - [Carole] That bug was bigger than my foot. - Operator I would like a number in Fort Lauderdale, the Roxbury residence. - [Carole] This has gotta go. - [Sandra] Just a minute, operator. - Perfect. What have you got in there? - One bottle of 151 proof rum, birth control pills, some Midol, my father's American Express card, king size bottle of Alka-Seltzer, too. One sexy black teddy.

My son needs me. - Darling, he hasn't needed you since he was six years old when he won the International Chopin Competition. - At Juilliard. - [Maggie] Besides, he's wealthier, smarter and far more pretentious than we are. - [Barbara] No one's more pretentious than we are. - [Maggie] Wanna bet? - Barbara Roxbury please. When? Oh, can you tell her her niece Sandra called? Sandra and I'm staying at the Lauderdale Beach Hotel. Si. Ooh, what's that? - My buddy, Dave. He was a gift and he'll be our bodyguard. - Laurie, it is way too crowded in here. He's gonna have to sleep in the tub. - Come on, Dave, time for bath. - [Jennie] Laurie, you're weird. - She's on vacation scrubbing other people's toilets and I'm weird? Let's get naked, Dave. (chuckling) (harpsichord music) - [Man] Hello, Mrs. Roxbury. - Hi, thanks. Oh God, we've missed him. I knew it. He's gonna be furious. Camden! Camden, darling, it's Mother! - And Maggie. - I know, I know. Are you sure there's no press? - Didn't I promise you? Sometimes I think you don't trust me. - Mother, you're a picture postcard. And Maggie, you are simply younger than springtime. - Oh, this boy's truly divine! Oh come on, Camden. Give your old mom a big smack on the chops! (smooching) (chuckling) - Camden, you look a little tired. How old is this French actress that you've been dating? The one we read about in People? The one you didn't mention to me? - Mother, that's my affair. - Don't you think you'd be more comfortable with people your own age? - Mother, let's set things straight. I'm here to do the concert for you and Maggie, as I promised, but by weekend I'll be going back to San Tropez for a little peace and quiet and a very long rest. - Oh, but darling.

I'm talking Conan the Barbarian. (giggling) I'm gonna wrap myself around him for one night of unbelievable raw, primal sex. - She's great when she holds back like this. - [Mr. Bullhorn] Attention!

I guess you'd know all about sunburns and things, being from Fort Lauderdale and all. - I'm dark complected. I don't burn. - Well, darlin', you just be extra careful, okay? - Uh huh. - He's cute. - And he's real sexy. - Police officers are not sexy. They're civil servants and you don't date them. You date bankers and lawyers-- - Lawyers. - [Sandra] And doctors-- - Doctors. - There she goes again. - Well, if I intend to leave here looking like Diana Ross, I'd better start catching some serious rays. (uptempo rock music) Oh my God, it's Conan. - Oh Jennie, be careful, be careful.

Come on in. - Well, thanks. Hey guys, come on in. - [Sandra] What are you doing? - [Jennie] What, are you kidding me? - I want to introduce you to my four fabulous musicians. That's Tony on the bass and camera. That's Jude and Ray on the guitars. And that's Jeff on the drums. (chattering) - This is Laurie, Sandra... - Carole. - [Scott] Carole. - Thank you. - And Jennie. - [Tony] Ray, we're losing light here. - I'm gonna call the front desk. - What are you doing? - I'm shooting a documentary. - On what? Half nude college girls? Get outta here. - He thinks he's Fellini. Anyway, you're all invited tonight to City Limits where we will be appearing live. - [Jennie] Okay, look, bye. - 9:30. (chattering) - Bye. (phone ringing) - [Scott] Now, don't forget, 9:30. - [Tony] Bye. (phone ringing) - [Jennie] Laurie, would you come back here? - [Laurie] No. - [Sandra] Hello Aunt Barbara. - [Jennie] I don't believe... - Sandra, what a surprise. I thought you'd be in Bermuda. So, where are you staying? Lauderdale Beach Hotel on the strip. How divine. With whom? Oh, your three roommates. Well, yes he is here, the little genius. I know he'd love to meet them. Where? The City Limits. How vivid. No, no, it's perfect, what time, 9:30? Great, right, bye. - Bye bye. Done. We are meeting my Aunt Barbara and my cousin Camden tonight at that club where Scott's playin'. - I don't believe it. (giggling) What's he really like? - Let me put it to you this way. To Camden Roxbury, a one night stand is an evening with the Boston Pops. (laughing) (knocking) - I got it. - [Carole] Careful, might be that creep from downstairs. - [Scott] Hi. - [Jennie] Hi. - I almost forgot, for you. - Oh, thank you. You really shouldn't have. I mean, this must have been expensive. - Some things are more important than money. - Thanks. It's Beethoven. - How nice. - [Jennie] From the Fort Lauderdale Public Library. Oh, gimme a break. (laughing) - Hey look. Come on, Toby, have a heart. - My heart's in the cash register right over there. - Well just put Scott Nash and the Ramblers to work and you'll have cash in the register over there. Come on, just let us perform tonight and you'll see that Nash means cash. Toby look, how do you expect me to go out there and tell the guys that you can't use 'em? I thought we had a deal. - Sorry my man. I don't need you. I got a band. - I'll tell you what, we'll work cheap. In fact, we'll work free. - What I need is busboys, dependable, responsible busboys. - Busboys? We're musicians. - [Gary] Chip, we've been driving up and down this strip for six hours. - [Chip] And we'll keep driving for six more hours until we find her. - It's a hundred degrees down here. I think we brought the wrong clothes. - Well, we're not here for sunning. We're here for spying. - How do you expect to find her? There's over two million college kids roaming around. - She's down here, I'll find her.

Come on, Maggie, Camden. Darling. - [Sandra] Barbara, over here. (chattering) Nice to see you. This is my friend Carole and Laurie and Jennie. My Aunt Barbara and Maggie. Come on, sit down. Hi Camden. - Very nice to see you in your real eminence, Sandra. - This place wasn't exactly my idea, cousin. We just came to see a friend of Jennie's perform. - Hi ladies. May I take your order? - Scott, I thought you guys were playing here tonight. - So did I, but I think we're gonna play in a couple nights. You know, I'm really glad you could make it. And to show you my appreciation, the first round of drinks is on me. So what'll it be? - I think we'd like to start with a magnum of Dom Perignon, be just fine. - How 'bout a round of beers? - Is he a friend of yours? - Well, not exactly. He's just a guy we picked up hitchhiking. He's someone we just met. - Waiter, I think we'll just have the champagne and you can put it on my Mastercard. - Yes, sir. (uptempo rock music) - This job is worse than the job I had in a pet cemetery in Cleveland. - Do me a favor, okay? - Oh sure, anything for a pal who got me into this in the first place. - Just take this order over to that table. - [Tony] What's the matter? Tray too heavy for ya? - No, I just may drop it on his head. - Hey guys. For someone with a personality of a cement block, I think Camden's kinda cute. - I think you better get your eyes examined for glasses when we get back to school. - Getting back to your (mumbling) interpretation of my third piano concerto. - No, your second. Your third was much more moderish in mood. - I actually think she understands his music. God knows I don't, but I love it. - You know, Jennie, I'd very much like to continue our conversation but this atmosphere is certainly not the most conducive. I'd like to see you again. Would you like to be my guest at the concert Saturday night? - I'd love to. - Very good, I'll take care of everything. Mother, Maggie, our 15 minutes are up. Time to say au revoir. - [Laurie] Oh, Camden we didn't even dance yet. - [Barbara] Bye, you sweet thing. - [Laurie] Oh, don't go. - [Maggie] Bye darlins. - [All] Bye.

Because he has perfect manners and a boat? (clapping) (uptempo music) (steamboat whistle blowing) - You guys, I think we just lost first prize. (catcalling) - [Jennie] There they are. - [Sandra] Jenny! - [Laurie] Hey! - [Jennie] Are you alright? (mumbling) - Listen, we got good news and bad news. The good news is that Carole and Jeff won second place in this Hot Bod contest, $150. - The bad news is, we only have enough money to get one of you out. - What? - What are we gonna do? - We'll flip a coin. Somebody call it. - Heads. - Tails. - Oh! - [Man] Open four. - We'll be back, okay? - [Sandra] Okay. - [Jennie] Don't worry. - [Laurie] Should we call her Aunt Martha? - [Jennie] Are you crazy? - Looks like your friends left you kinda high and dry. - What friends? I don't have any friends. This is it. Alone, behind bars. How did I fall so low so fast? - I think you've done enough time, lady. Open four. How 'bout a cup of coffee? - Yeah okay, I'd like that. (clanging) You're Officer Brasso, right? - [Ernie] You can call me Ernie. - [Sandra] Oh, thanks. Listen, could I call my friends? - [Ernie] That's a good idea. Coffee may turn into dinner.

Is this a little too trashy? - [Carole] On you, never. - I still can't get over him saying we have an appointment tomorrow night. I love it. It's not a date, it's an appointment. I've got a scheduled rendezvous with Conan. - God, Laurie, can't you think of anything else? - Hey, where have you been? - Oh, I've been to the moon, Jupiter, Camelot even Shangri la. - God, I shoulda stayed in jail. - Ladies, I'm in love. - Are you kidding? What about Bermuda? - Oh, screw Bermuda. I'm not gonna leave this paradise. - [Laurie] God, jail changed her. - For the better. - Well, tell us all about it. Who is he? - I don't know. Maybe he'll be the great love of my life, like Chip is to Carole. - Chip is no longer the great love of my life. We're estranged. - What can I say? He's strong, attentive, committed. - What else? - Dedicated, thoughtful. - Who you datin' ? Clark Kent? (giggling) - There's just one little problem but it's nothing. I think we can overcome it. - He's gay. - No, married. - Same thing. - Oh no! - Yeah, I know. I never thought of myself as the kind that goes around wrecking homes, but I guess you gotta start somewhere, right? (mumbling) Actually, they're separated. - That's what they all say. Has he got any kids? - Yeah, a boy. Imagine me with a son? - Sandra, just go for it. - Laurie, this isn't just a fling. I'm a little scared. What if he just wants to go to bed with me? What if he's just trying to use me? - Just use him back, it's very simple. - No, what if I get-- - Oh, would you stop with the what-ifs? You're obviously crazy about this guy. Now, you should just go be with him and have a good time. You never know until you try. - [Sandra] Oh yeah, yeah. I guess. Maybe I will. - You know what I'd kill for right now? - What? - Pizza. (laughing) (thudding) Room service'll get that. Nurse, she's out of her room again. (laughing) - I'm starting to fantasize about Ernie already. - Uh oh. - I hope he's the one that's gonna make me oh! - Make you what? - Cough it up. - Come! (shrieking) (laughing) - Now what a minute, wait a minute. You gonna tell me nothing happened with you and Peter or Brad behind ivy walls? - Nope, not once. I've only had six experiences and that counts as two times where I just kinda shook. (laughing) While everyone else was playing doctor, I was trying to figure out how to marry one. - [Laurie] I think it's time for a little education. - [Jennie] What are you gonna do? - Put on something romantic. - [Carole] What are you doing? - [Jennie] You don't like this? (laughing) - [Laurie] Music! Dave, are you done with your bath? - Nurse, she's out of her room. - [Laurie] Here he comes, squeaky clean. - [Sandra] Is this romantic enough? Okay. - You've already begun to fantasize, so fantasize this as Ernie. (laughing) - Ernie is not inflatable. - He better be, else I'd break the date with him. (laughing) - You're both feeling those strong animal impulses, so you start out with a simple kiss. - What? - Oh, Laurie. - He doesn't have herpes, just kiss him okay? Relax. Nothing'll ever happen if you're tense, okay? - Okay. - [Laurie] Okay. Now, kiss him. - [Carole] Oh God. - Not like he's your grandfather. Just kiss him. - [Jennie] Where's my camera? (laughing) - [Laurie] Come on. - [Jennie] Okay, now give me a great shot. - Go for it girl. (moaning) Feel anything yet? - Not a thing. - Maybe you should dig your nails into his back. - Only if you really feel it because you can't fake it. - Fake it? The woman is screwing a hefty bag (mumbling). (laughing) Oh my God! - Well, start again. - Okay. - With foreplay, alright? - Oh, you gotta be kidding. - Body kissing. - [Carole] Body kissing? - Now, start on the mouth, okay? - [Carole] Just pretend he's Richard Gere. (laughing) - Here we go. - Okay, good, now linger there a minute and then slowly move to the cheek. And it tastes like a combination of suntan oil-- - And rubber. (laughing) - Now, you slowly move off the cheek, across his chin and your mouth slides down his neck. Tastes like apricot brandy. - I'm suffocating. - Okay, you can hardly stand it now. As your tongue comes down his neck, to his heaving chest... (laughing) you place your lips on either one of his nipples, okay? - Nipples? Oh gross, Laurie, come on. (laughing) - Now, you kiss it, and then, feeling very reckless, you gently, gently, but firmly bite it. (popping) (shrieking) (hissing) - She killed him. (somber music) - [Laurie] Goodnight, sweet prince. (waves lapping) - [Sandra] Laurie, I'm truly, truly sorry. - [Laurie] It's okay, hon, as long as you climax with Ernie. Dave would have wanted it that way. (giggling) (uptempo pop music) (engine rumbling) (light classical music) - [Maggie] Oh, I see the Cabots are here. Charlie had time for these little wing-dings. - Oh, he'll do anything I ask ever since I found out about the affair with the Jeep driver. - Ooh, I bet you didn't waste a second in letting him know. - You know how I hate keeping secrets. - [Maggie] Isn't that Carola Minola? - [Barbara] It certainly is. - [Maggie] I thought she was dead. - That never stopped her from coming to one of my parties before. - And on the patio, Mother in 1983 built the cascades over the pool. Oh, here she is right now. Hello. (chattering) - Thought you got lost, hi. - Hi, girls. - Aunt Barbara, I would like you to meet my escort, police officer Ernest Grasso. - Where did you two meet? - In jail. - Why don't you say hello to Christina Lawson, our favorite debutante. (chattering) - Carole, where is that adorable Laurie? - She couldn't make it. - Yeah, she had a previous appointment. (soft pop music) (doorbell ringing) - [Conan] You're late. - [Laurie] Just five minutes. - [Conan] Time is money. - Right. Satin sheets, nice. - [Conan] They'd look nicer with you in 'em. - That could be arranged. You don't waste any time, do you? - I told you, time is money. - That's the second time you've said that. What's that all about? - I'm a businessman, lady. You wanna play, you gotta pay. - You expect me to pay you? What are you, on drugs or something? You son of a bitch. Pay for it my ass. Okay, get undressed. - What? - You heard me. If I'm buying a piece of meat, I sure as hell intend to see what's under the wrapper. Come on, come on, time is money remember? That too. Yeah. So, where's the rest of it? I'll see you in small claims court. - You must have had a wonderful childhood growing up here. - I wouldn't know. I was on tour when my childhood was supposed to happen. - [Barbara] Oh, they look so happy together. God, I hope she's from a good family. - Why? You weren't.

Mother has really done it this time. The only thing that can save us is some nice champagne. - Oh, sounds great. So, how's the new piece coming along? - I haven't really figured out what to call it yet. Could be one of my most important works. Except for one phrase. If I could find that, then all the rest would fall into place. I suppose that's the story of my life. Finding that right note. Perfect phrase, exact sound. You know how frustrating that can be.

You interrupted my flow. - The only thing that would interrupt your flow is if someone shoved a fist in your mouth. - Scott. - I haven't got time to exchange snide remarks. I'm an artist. I've got to be alone. - Apologize to Jennie. - Apologize for what? - It's okay. - For acting like an asshole. - I don't think I've treated your or Jennie any differently than I've treated anyone else. - Oh, so you treat everyone badly. - Please get out of here. - Hey, why don't you and I just go outside and settle this? - There's no room outside. - Would you two please stop it?

I wanna talk to you. - I don't feel like talking right now. - Why are you mad at me? I was just defending you back there. - I don't need you to defend me. - Jennie, I don't get it. I mean, you're a very special girl, you really are. But it makes me goddamn mad that Camden Roxbury could just dismiss you like you were the hired help. - I don't really think he meant it that way. - Camden Roxbury is an arrogant fool. He doesn't give a damn about anything but his work. - Well, maybe he has a right to feel like that. - Would you stop defending him? - You're just jealous. - Yeah, you're right, I am. I wish you felt that way about me, because I really care about you, Jennie. I care about you so much. (horn honking) - I have to go. - No, for once can't we just finish something? - Finish what? (horn honking) I can't. - [Scott] Jennie. Jennie, no. - First my party's ruined, then my house is destroyed, now someone's stolen my car. - I've always said Barbara, you throw one hell of a party. (uptempo party music) (engine rumbling) - Oh, I should have never come down here. I should have gone to Vermont instead of acting like a silly adolescent. - Sounds like true love to me. My second husband was exactly the same way. - Really? What'd you do? - Divorced him. - Great, that's just what I need to hear. - Listen, lamb. You come with me to the concert tonight. I'm sure your girlfriend will be there. You'll work the whole thing out. - I hope so. Listen, Maggie, about last night. Everything's sorta vague, you know? - Listen, don't worry. When you remember, and you will, it'll be dynamite. (speaking foreign language) - That's the brightest moon I've ever seen. - That's not the moon, that's the sun. Have you ever had a hangover this bad before? - No. - You know what I gotta do today? I gotta finish my suite. - Our suite. - It's my suite. Your note. You ever try to do anything difficult? You know, like sit down and really work on your music? - Sure. It's about getting that one lucky break. - The only breaks you get are the ones that you make happen. You want success but you don't do anything about it. I know you got talent. So do I. The only thing that makes us different is desire. Until you learn that, you'll just be another ripple in the pond. (speaking foreign language) - It goes over here in front of the sofa. (speaking foreign language) - Must have been some party, huh? - Yes, I'm surprised you weren't there. - I was. Carola Minola, remember? (laughing) (soft pop music) - Hello. - Hello. - These are for you. - Thank you, they're beautiful. - Let me put 'em in water for you. (chuckling) Jennie. I want to apologize for my behavior last night. - Oh, let's talk about something else, alright? I'd really like to forget last night. - So would I. If I could only remember what happened. Jennie, I'd still like you to be my guest at the concert tonight. - Okay, I'd like that. - Good. If you'll excuse me, I've got to add the finishing touches to my suite. Or die. Whichever comes first. Ciao. - Hi. - Morning Camden. - That's questionable. - What's he doing here? - He came to apologize and he even brought me flowers. - Flowers? I think that's romantic. - Romantic? Since when have you been into romantic? I thought it was strictly Conan. - Oh yeah, whatever happened to your appointment? How'd it go? - It went. But, Conan turned out to be just another jerk in a leopard bikini. - Something's gotta hold him together. - Wasn't much to hold. - Hi y'all. Hey, give me a minute to change so I can join ya on the beach. I just can't wait to share my joy. - [Jennie] I think I'm gonna be sick. (chattering) - Okay, so after the fourth time, I just had to say, "Enough." - I'm gonna kill her. - [Jennie] When are you gonna see him again? - Tonight, I asked him to the concert. He said he'd call me later. - What about Scott? - Oh, Scott's, he's just a guy. - Just a guy? Jennie, I saw him kiss you last night. That's not just a guy. - Yeah, well, I don't know. I'm so confused. On one hand, there's Scott and on the other hand there's Camden. - I should have these problems. (chuckling) - Jennie, it's me, Carole. Remember me, your friend, your pal? You know you can talk to yourself 'til you're blue in the face, but actions speak louder than words. That's really a boring phrase. - You're right. - Jennie, I was thinking maybe you could take Scott and leave Camden for me. - Are you serious? - You like my cousin Camden? - Well, sorta. - Laurie! Now, I can understand Jennie being attracted to him 'cause he's her idol and all, but you! I don't know, I just never thought of him as your type. - One never knows the chemistry between a male and a female, does one? - [Jennie] Whoa, I think she means business. - Hey, listen, I'm gonna go back to the room 'cause I'm expecting that call. - Good, see ya later. - [Sandra] Leave my towel, okay? - Alright. So, wanna take a dip? - Yeah. (mellow music) - Are you sure you're gonna be alright? (melancholy music) I feel bad leaving her here. - You can stop talking behind my back. - [Carole] We weren't. Let's go. - [Jennie] We'll save ya a seat. Come and meet us. (applauding) - Oh thank you, thank you. Isn't this a lovely night? In case any of you didn't know, I'm Barbara Roxbury. - [Woman] Hi Barb. - Oh, thank you. Well, welcome welcome one and all to this year's concert for the United Charities of South Florida. We are very lucky to have with us our own native son, and incidentally, my own son. (applauding) Without further ado, performing his world famous Quantum Sonata, Camden Roxbury. (applauding) (dramatic piano music) - Oh God. Make it ring, and I'll never eat another Godiva chocolate as long as I live. (dramatic piano music) - [Ernie] What are you doing here? - [Sandra] What do you mean what am I doing here? You were supposed to pick me up. - [Ernie] Yeah, but come here, you shouldn't come over here. - Well, I'm not used to getting stood up. - I didn't stand you up. - We had a date. I waited for you, you didn't show up, now what would you call it? - Sandy, I explained my whole situation when you and I just got started. - You're back with your wife, aren't you? - No. Yes. Not really. Look, she lost her job and on my salary, I can't afford to pay two rents honey, so I let her move back in. It's just for a while. - I see. - No, I don't know if you do see. I'm talking about I'm in bad financial shape. I'm confused. I don't know if I'm coming or going, all I know is I'm crazy about you and there's nothing I can do about it. Do you understand me? All I'm asking you, honey, is just give me a little time. Please, a little time, that's all. - I don't think you're ready to let go, are you? - What? - I don't think you're ready to let go and I can't afford to hang around and wait for you not to be confused anymore. I mean, that just might not happen, so, I think I need to be the one who lets go. Bye, Ernie. (dramatic piano music) (applauding) (cheering) - Thank you. Thank you.
