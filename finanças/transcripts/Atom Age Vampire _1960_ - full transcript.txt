Pierre! It's over. Pierre, please! Pierre! Go put some clothes on! I won't be a minute... Try to get it through your head, Jeanette. I only came in to tell you goodbye. Goodbye? Pierre! It's all over. You had your choice... Either me or this so-called profession you're working at... You're still working, so that means I'm through! Oh, please don't treat me like this, you know your ship is about to sail! It's better for us... it's easier if I go away. Easier to what? To suffer more than we have already? You know we belong with each other, Pierre! Please Jeanette, let's end this now! No! Listen to me! I know you don't like my job, but I have to make a living! I told you I've had enough. Don't act this way! I'm ready to marry you, even now. But as for giving you my heart? No! It's your fault then...yours! I am young, Pierre, and I love you. But I'm not the kind of wife who would torture you for two months just for two days of happiness! And yet you did... and you are not even my wife. I did it, but only because I hoped you would understand! Let's start over again! I can't, Jeanette. I can't. This is my life. Then... thanks for the cigarettes. They were very costly. There has never been anyone else but you. Aren't you forgetting something, Jeanette? I'd like it back. This? Didn't you say you would always protect me? Let me keep it. I need this to protect me now! Pierre! We can't let it end like this! We're both crazy about each other, aren't we? Goodbye Jeanette...! I'll take you to the port... No... Pierre! Get moving, there are a lot of people out there, do another number! I won't do another number, I'm fed up with this job! A car...off the road...! It's burning...! Hurry! Try to get her out! Hurry, bring water! Miss Moreneau? You haven't eaten anything today... I thought you might like a nice cup of tea. It's been almost three months, hasn't it? Yes, more or less... and in a few more days now... I could read the truth in the eyes of Professor Morette... There isn't a bit of hope for me... I'm mutilated...disfigured... ...forever...! You might as well be prepared for the worst but it won't make any difference to someone who really loves you! I don't want to be pitied by anyone! Especially by him...oh, leave me alone...! At least drink a cup of tea... Leave me alone! Professor, we have a problem, should I give her an injection? Miss Moreneau must find the strength within herself to face this. I do not want to deceive you... I don't want to be deceived! Certainly your life will change... you will need to find another job... but this does not... Do you think that's why I despair? When can I leave the hospital? But there is no rush... I want to leave! But we have not changed your bandages... I'm tired...I want to sleep... Miss... I would say the same thing even if you were my own daughter... Your life is not over. And what would your daughter answer...? She has no family here, not even friends close enough to worry about her... the newspapers made that clear. Go to her. Does anybody know you at that clinic? No one! And no one must know that Jeanette Moreneau is coming here. No one will know. I have complete faith in you, as always... and I know that I shall succeed! You're going to need me... I'll be here, Albert! No! You musn't give up all hope yet! Who are you? Don't ask me questions, there isn't time. I'm an assistant to a great scientist who has come to hear of your case and who wants to know more about you. He wants to give you treatment! What's the use of treatment? What's the use? You have to believe me... We have discovered a new therapy together, and it's miraculous! I guarantee it! Hello Lerois! Hi! Don't tell me you're here because you want to interview me? You don't think so? Ok, then, I won't tell you that! Did you read about that girl? Who do you mean? Aw, come on...! What about this for a big headline? "Jeanette Moreneau, happy and beautiful as ever!" Think about the publicity for your clinic! Sure, but that's a headline you'll never print! Why not? Doctor, it's time for your rounds... At your service! So long Lerois, see you around! Goodbye! Eh..goodbye, sister...! I have three children, 'brother'... and a boyfriend who is a boxer! Did you get it right? Did you remember everything? Now secrecy is necessary... ...and I mean absolutely! Not a word to a soul! This is the only hope you have, keep that in mind... always! You will drop out of sight for a short time, three or four weeks at the very most... and when you reappear, everything will be as it was before... as if you'd awakened from a horrible dream. Don't you don't believe me? Well, then, do just as you wish! I have never been to see you. But we'll be expecting you... ...now don't disappoint me! I'm not being immodest when I speak of a whole new era in the field of biology and therapy. The destructive and degenerative effect of atomic explosions has driven scientists more than ever before into research involving processes of regeneration. Rebuilding abnormal or totally destroyed cells, it is completely successful in correcting abnormal cell growth... as well as in restoring cells which have been destroyed. Just as good often grows out of evil, Derma 28 has grown out of Derma 25, the serum which provoked and accelerated abnormal development of cells. When I finally succeeded in stabilizing it's effects I produced the counter vaccine, which for years had been the major goal of the most important scientific research. Repeated experiments using Derma 28 on specimens deformed by injections of Derma 25 prove it's miraculous efficiency without a doubt! A single injection of Derma 28... Monique, what are you doing? Don't you realize...? Why, you must be completely insane! Yes, it's the Derma 25 serum that we've been injecting in so many of those poor little animals... ...transforming them into monsters! You're aware of it's effects! Look at that! Come on... You'll have to be exposed to treatment at once in the radiation chamber! No! Give me an injection of Derma 28... But you know that it's never been tried on human beings...I wouldn't have the courage! That's just why I did it, to push you to have the courage! No! Let's wait for the girl, Jeanette Moreneau! No! I want to share this honor with you! I've never been as near to you before as I am at this moment... and you will always remember it... We don't need you! Sacha, don't be troubled about me. When its over you can bring me some roses! Leave us now. Quickly, every second we have is precious! Every drop of Derma 28 represents months of work and anxiety... And when the day comes when we can prepare it as rapidly as Derma 25... Give me your arm! Yes! There is no doubt... There is not the slightest doubt any longer! Do you see? It removes every trace of degenerative cell structure! This is the day that comes but once in a lifetime! That is OUR lifetime... ...That's right. I shall always remember everything you've done for me! Thank you! Tell me that in some other way...tell it to "Monique"... not "your assistant"! We'll celebrate this evening! No, lets both stay home together with our records! One moment... Why'd you look at me that way? For a moment there, you seemed to be performing some sacred ritual...! Yes...it WAS a ritual! Come! Permission to go ashore, Commander? You look pretty happy! Is everything all right? Of course, otherwise I would not have asked. Thank you! You're going to see her...? Then you've decided...? Yes, I've decided... I still want to marry Jeanette! She's quite certain that I'm in the wrong, eh? Who's to say who is right or wrong in these things? I have not seen the shore in what seems like forever... Well, for that matter, neither have I... but in 3 months I've had time to reflect. I love her. She hasn't even written you... She is too proud! - And you? We are alike...! I wish you well then, you and I take our commitments seriously! Thank you! Is this Professor Levin's? So you've come to us? I'm happy to see you! And your luggage? - In the checkroom at the station, as you instructed. Where's the ticket? - Here it is... Are you sure no one knows you've come here? Positive.. - Go and pick up her luggage! Let's go into the study... Professor Levin will join us in a moment. But...this isn't like a clinic! - No, it's not a clinic. It's the place where Doctor Levin studies and does his work...with me to help him! Show me your face! Show me your face, I said! - Noo... There's no doubt of it! Yes... She's disfigured forever! As if by a cancer that's beyond control! ...like leprocy! There's no one who can help me now... No one! Let me go away...please! I give you my word that I will restore your face...restore all your beauty! You're worse than all the others because you want to deceive me! Don't talk like that! - Now pull yourself together... We have succeeded in discovering a great secret, the secret of spontaneous reproduction of living cells It's the secret of life itself! - The secret of life...and also of death! Just now I deliberately spoke of cancer... of cells which proliferate unexpectedly, at the expense of the organism, until they have destroyed it. Well, with this remarkable discovery, we have succeeded in creating spontaneous reproduction of cells... we can rebuild cells which have been destroyed...we have tamed the monster which once devoured us and made it serve our own ends! You must see now? It's a miracle! And you will be the first person in the world to benefit from it! I shall perform this miracle! I've never believed in miracles... I've even forgotten how to pray! Oh, please, let me go now, rather than go on like this... No... You prefer to kill yourself? If you've given up all hope, why didn't you do it before this? You're condemned for the rest of your life! And you know it! She knows it, they all told her that! All right...let me kill myself... Right now. If you really are so desperate, take your own life if you want to! Yes...I'll give this back to you... but only on that day when you look me in the face and tell me I failed you! Do you understand, Jeanette? But until that day comes... Will you try? No, no, I beg of you... She's fainted. I've had a room prepared... Oh, Albert! And now we must take her upstairs... She's a beautiful human specimen... Beautiful? Didn't you hear about it? No, I didn't hear anything about the accident, I was at sea! We had just sailed, but... You mean today she had all of her belongings collected from the Hotel Tour and had them delivered here, at the clinic? It's all beyond me... She told me she was going back to that apartment hotel where she lived... The same Hotel Tour... Jeanette must still be in town! Or it might mean she has gone away... There can only be one explanation... As a nurse, I'll have to betray a secret... Jeanette Moreneau didn't want to see you again as she is. Nobody in the world can restore her beauty. and you know it.... - To me, she's just as beautiful as before Jeanette is wrong... but she's only doing it because she wants the best for you. Sacha! Sacha! You didn't turn on the generator! Drunken scoundrel! See you later, Andre! Goodbye, Mr. Demaun. Would you like another? One moment... Arlette, where are you going? Just wait! It certainly seems unlikely that a person could disappear in one hour without a trace! Give me another drink. Make it two, even though it won't help. 2 more glasses of gin! Jeanette's pride is to blame for this... When I went to the clinic she would not let me see her. I couldn't even see her? And when she sent for her stuff... Arlette! Get back to your table! Now I will apply the Derma locally... Sponge... Forceps... Derma... Nothing...no effect! What now? Inject the Derma! Nothing... still nothing! The nightclub is closed for the evening Goodnight Arlette! - Goodnight! Pierre! Still here? I'll take you home... Is it late? Yes...far...too late... Will you come with us to my car? There's not a single drop left! 5 injections and no effect! And I am NOT wrong... it worked on you! It worked on me because you applied it immediately after the cells were destroyed! Repeat applications will be necessary! Perhaps you're right... but it takes months to prepare new... We must find someone else in order to create more Derma 28! And should we also tell her what we tried on her? We should kill her! But think of it...if more Derma 28 will work differently... Do not forget, it is derived from Derma 25! I can not think of her as a... As a monster, right? You worry too much about her. Albert! Look! Jeanette... You shouldn't have been pessimistic, I never had a moment's doubt! Bring me something to drink please... Albert? - If you don't mind! Here. Let's drink a toast to our victory! First take her upstairs. Albert! Look Albert! And the state of shock is completely over! There can't be any more doubt of it, we've won! Doesn't it please you? Yes... but right at the moment, all I'm able to feel is sheer exhaustion! It's as if I were afraid... Of what? - Will there be after effects now? Will the regeneration of cells continue as it should? I'm sure it will... Have I slept too long? You? - Yes, Jeanette, it's Professor Levin... The man who has... give me your hand! I owe you more than my life itself! Jeanette! Get back in bed now, you have suffered great physical shock with all this. You've recovered, yes... but we must wait a bit... We must be certain what the results are! Absolutely sure! Don't doubt it, Jeanette. The miracle has happened to you! And you will remain with us until we can be sure and proclaim it to the entire world! Another one? - Another one... Don't you feel happy? Don't you want to laugh and sing for joy? And Monique? I wonder why she hasn't returned? I suppose she has an experiment she's working on. Anyway, isn't it better like this? We're seldom without Monique... No...all of it! What do you want here? Do you remember how you embraced me when you first saw that you were cured? What was then gratitude has already become love! You shouldn't believe that, if I loved you I'd surely tell you... I'll tell YOU! You love me! You weren't able to see clearly inside your heart, and you're still too upset by everything that has happened, but you love me, you must know you love me! I have snatched you away from desperation and from death! It is I who restored your beauty! It is I who needs you! I'll never be able to live without you! Albert... - No, Jeanette. You are nothing if not mine! You belong to me! Wait a moment... I've almost forgotten... Excuse me a moment! Albert! Tell me what it is? - Nothing! Nothing at all... something rather urgent which I've forgotten to tell Monique. Monique! Monique! Monique! Oh... I don't know what's wrong! It's as if my face were on fire... - Sit down here a moment. You'll be all right! Monique, I don't understand... Albert... What's wrong with me? - I'm here, Jeanette! Just relax, you're very tired. Now she will sleep soundly for several hours. Time is pressing, move her to the labratory at once! It must be a success... it must be, understand? Don't count any longer on me! - Monique! She means more to you now than just an experiment! - Monique! I can not do it without you! Then I'll make a condition... ...you know what it is... Yes, never see her again, I give you my word, believe me! Sacha, help us carry her to the labratory. I've prepared everything, but what's to be done? Bah! If there were only a single drop of it still left! But there isn't any! - I refuse to give up now! We'll try radiation! Have you gone mad? - Yes, yes I know it's madness...but I'm willing to take any risk for her! You know very well it's useless, her scar tissue is forming again. The radioactive treatment is effective only against Derma 25! Jeanette... She mustn't suffer like this...! But there's always surgery... an insertion! You're out of your mind! - Yes, that's it, it's the only possible solution! I'll transplant the glands which produce Derma 28 directly from another human being... from another woman, a young one! - Albert, you must be insane! You've gone mad over her! - I gave you my solemn word... Now I know that I can't trust you, how will you accomplish it? By murdering the first woman that passes, and if the after effects aren't any different you'll kill another woman, and another! But I refuse to be your accomplice! Monique! - And if they ask for the truth, I'll tell, I'll tell, do you hear? Monique, come back here! Monique! Monique! Listen to me, Monique! - Stop it, we've already said enough to each other! She's lying down there - alone! - It's not possible to save her...what can we do? But I'm still here, and so are you! - What more do you want of me? Sacrifice myself for her? - You're impossible! Yes, it's true...! I'm infatuated with her, but it will pass... Pass away... it's not love really, it's a sentimental complex, it's only a compulsion I want to dominate the girl, to possess her creatively! You will have to help me in this also, help me overcome this infatuation! Struggle along with me as you always have done before! Can't you manage to convince yourself she won't remain like this...like this! She has nothing to do with the two of us. I promise we will send her far away... far away! I will forget her...we will start all over again and be successful... please try to be the same intelligent woman you've always been! You know I would kill a thousand times before I would admit defeat! Please be reasonable.... You know that we are bound together forever. Forever and ever... Police Commissioner Bousciard. - You're Professor Levin, aren't you? Have we met before? - No, but your name is so well known from your photographs and your t.v. interviews. Permette Dovrei, medical pathologist. Marion, my assistant. - I'm sorry we had to disturb you this way. You did telephone us, didn't you? - I'm all alone here at the moment. Shall we go inside? - Good! - Chief, I'm out of cigarettes, do you mind if I... Yes! Can't you go half an hour without smoking? What is it, Sacha? Why did you come in without knocking on my door? Did Professor Levin send you? Oh.. I have a splitting headache! Oh yes... the champagne...! Where is Monique? What do you mean, Sacha? What's happened to Monique? No... no, it's not true! I don't believe it, its not possible! Monique! Monique! Paralysis of the heart, its quite obvious. And she showed no symptoms? No warning beforehand? Oh yes... I've kept her under special care for almost 2 years. I'll make out the certificate at once! Without an autopsy? - An autopsy? I've already confirmed the diagnosis given by Doctor Levin... and out of consideration... - No no, if its usual practice... Inspector, if the decision lies within my jurisdiction, I say no autopsy! Oh no... if one isn't necessary... - Absolutely not! Excuse me. I'm going down to my office. I don't get it! Levin could be her lover! - So what? He is an expert. Doctor, I'm going to have a look in the studio. - Okay, Inspector! He's an expert at picking assistants, at any rate... She was from Sherbourne... Monique Riviere. You'll find her identification and papers in her room. She suffered from dizzy spells, and palpatations. I should show you something... Ah, here it is... This is her most recent electrocardiogram, I kept it where she wouldn't find it. Better show this thing to our pathologist, to me its Chinese! You know, Professor, I'd say I know you intimately. Oh, does that amaze you? Well, it doesn't take a long white beard to be a scientist, even a famous one! But I know your articles, I've read your interviews, and I saw you on t.v. when you returned from Japan. Oh, by the way, these strange looking bottles, are they from... Yes, Hiroshima. The result of deformative fusion of bottles, glasses, and ceramics near each other. The people of Hiroshima sell them as souvenirs. Well, anyway, its a rather shocking sight. And did you remain a long time there? Sit down, please! For 8 months... at the Japanese Institute for Radiological Research. Oh? How interesting! - Please. Ah... no thank you, I gave up smoking. Then you've had a close look at those poor creatures? Certainly... and from then on, I've devoted my life to such research. What research, exactly? Are you aquainted with the field of genetic mutations? Yes, vaguely speaking... Frogs, that after the atomic explosion, produced frogs with 2 heads? Exactly! Suppose that mutations could be made permanent or not, as we please? Imagine if this were so, what extraordinary developments it could lead to? What you mean is... exploit the horror by extracting its advantages? The bad which justifies the good, is that it? More or less, I suppose. During your television interview, you showed some interesting photos. Oh, yes - they're in this album. May I? - Please do! Poor, wretched people... And the psychological consequences in these victims? That's a most intelligent question! Well, the relationship between body and soul has not yet been established. A problem we can let go by, I think. Or am I wrong? Well then, doctor? I've made out the certificate... paralysis of the heart. "Gorilla Escapes From The Zoo" What's that? She's dead! Aaahhh!!! Stop, stop! Let's go to the police...! Ah! Today I'm glad to be alive! Thank you for making me so happy! I didn't want you to get the impression that you're a prisoner there on my account, through necessity of keeping everything a secret! What are you looking at? - The water... The water? - Yes, I'm sorry... isn't there any music? Jeanette... you're so distant. Oh, Albert, please don't make me explain! All right, no explanations. Radio: No one could know the escape from the zoo would lead to tragedy. Radio: But who would have thought a wild beast with such ferocious instincts would kill the poor girl with such savage fury? I wanted to hear some music! Albert... What is it? - I just suddenly noticed that my face is burning like the other night! The night Monique... - Don't get excited, we're going back home. I wonder what it is? - Put them on now... your glasses! Jeanette is upstairs in her room, she won't wake up for several hours. But I want you to watch outside her door, and don't move from there until you see me. Put this stuff somewhere else! I must save her at any cost... I'd give my life to save her! There's always one way... insertion! Transplant the gland from another woman, a young one! Monique: What would you have me do? Sacrifice myself for her? - Yes... another one like Monique! - And if the after effects are the same? - Another, and another... until I've saved her once and for all! But I don't have the courage... I don't want to kill again... Inspector: I've heard about you... your articles, your interviews on television... Yes, I know, I know! Radio: But who if not a wild beast with the most ferocious insticts could have killed the poor girl with such savage fury...? - yes, Derma 25, exactly, Derma 25! It can create a monster... - A monster who doesn't fear killing. Who doesn't suffer if it kills. Young lady... Eh? Hey, it's late... Come here, I'll give you anything you ask! All right...you really gave me a turn... What are we playing, hide and seek? Aaahhh! Jeanette... You see? Are you convinced now? - Oh, but... - Stay calm... And without this obsession for your looking glass! I know you're thinking of yesterday! I'm still upset myself... you're afraid the cure will not be permanent! But you're mistaken! Now it's only a question of cell growth, I've already solved this problem. We must allow the cells we've regenerated to achieve lasting stability, nourish them artificially for a time. And especially with a transplant... - Transplant? Yes, it must be done, and it must be done more than once. Why are you staring at me? I told you I'm tired and upset! I spent the whole night working in the labratory so you could wake up as you are! How many more times will you have to treat me? - A few, very few. No one hopes so more than I do. You can never understand what it has cost me to make you well again, and yet all I'd have to do is tell you, to make you realize how deeply I love you... Jeanette! No! Leave me alone, Albert, please go! I'm going to get dressed now... we can see each other later on in the garden. Very well then. Hello? Yes, Lieutenant Mornet has already departed for Cape Town. I need to get a letter to him, it is urgent, is there any way to get it to him? Ah... certainly, it can be delivered by air at the stopover on his return journey. Don't mention it! Excuse me Sacha! Albert is out of cigarettes, and he knows I don't smoke, can you go out and buy them? Ah.. and please, can you send this for me? The rest is for you, keep the change. Don't forget to send it? Thank you! Pierre, my love, nothing has changed between us, at least not for me, and now I need you. Pierre, I'm afraid! Thank you Sacha, you did well. Yes, I know I can always count on you. As for this letter... no, I'll tell him, but keep her in your sight. And when I'm not here, turn off the phone as I have taught you. And.. this evening I have work to do here, I do not want to be disturbed. until I call for you... Do you understand? Go! Good evening Mirella. - Good evening Paulette. What's up tonight? - I'm going to smoke a cigarette and then I'm going home! - We're going to make another round and then we're going home too. Ahhhh......... Mirella? Mirella? Where did she go? Bah...there is no one there... What are you doing here? What are we supposed to do? - Go home, aren't you afraid of the gorilla? The gorilla? - It's better than gorilla men! We should get a medal for hunting a big gorilla! - What happened to it? Where did it go? - This meeting's private. - Tell her to leave! Hello Lerois! Hello again! - Good morning, what can I do for you? Ah... I bring greetings for the Chief from my uncle, the General! He is.. he is... do you know him? No. ah.. well, that's ok! I wanted to tell you that my friends and I were all in front of the Bistro last night. You must find her! - But what do you want me to do? You don't need an encyclopedia to identify a gorilla... - Please search again... Sir, we have a lady here who says she saw the gorilla! What gorilla? Seddok! Please be seated. - Thank you! Lerois? - I'm not moving! So you encountered the gorilla? - No.. not the gorilla... Seddok! ah... - A monstrous creature! Both man and beast at the same time.. eyes of an animal, claws like a vulture! I always knew I would meet him... Ah.. you knew? - Yes, since I was a little girl! It appeared in a dream, at the bottom of a dark room... Ah.. and it told you its first name was Seddok? Ah.. you joke, but if you ever found yourself face-to-face... Luckily for me, it did not see me, I was paralyzed with horror! I looked up at its claws above me.. - And where did you come from tonight? Ma'am, this speech is very interesting, it's wasted on just us alone, you know? Ma'am? - My assistant will take you to some nice friends of mine. And they will take down your statement word-for-word, okay? But you must listen to me! - No, no, ma'am, I can't see you right now. Our friends have nothing else to do. - And they will take your picture! Really? - Certainly, certainly.. good day... - Good day... but I don't have a trace of makeup on! And what need of it do you have? Well, you didn't go to hear her tale? - I don't go hunting for news of fairy tales! And not without a hunting license! - Of course.. but she gave me an idea! The idea's free, But you need to disappear! Thank you, goodbye! ...when suddenly, at the corner of Ruber Rue... I see then, Seddok is the personification of repressed sexual tension? A psychoanalyst for the lady! - I prefer Fernandel! Don't listen to these stories! - Just don't talk to me any more if you don't believe me! Uh-oh, you've offended her, I'm going back to the newspaper! - Who's paying? But where will you hide this crafty gorilla? Not gorillas, I just told you that... - It's their loss! Lady, remember me? Five minutes ago, in the office of the Inspector? Ah yes! - Thank goodness... It's nice to be noticed by a lady like you... So tell me, eh? I believe you! Seddok killed her! Seddok? It's not a gorilla, but a monster! Who would believe this! - These days we will believe anything, huh? We'll go to the moon next! But it is certain, however, that gorillas are a bit too bloody for this... and gorillas do not repeat the same type of crime! So you think there is a Seddok? - Have you ever heard of sexual predators? This report for the chief just came in on the teletype from central. What is it, a lost dog? But... - Another victim! - Another... She was found earlier in the harbor area. The same injuries, the same m.o.... Seddok! - Shut up! Gorilla or man, the killer is free and it is here in the city! "Killed By Gorilla" "Escaped from the Zoo" Right, there you go, Lanchette! You are all so greedy! Radio: We repeat, in the last hour there was a statement from the local police. The gorilla that escaped from the zoo is no longer a threat! The animal was tracked down and killed by one of the numerous patrols... - See? A gorilla... nothing but a gorilla! They do not want to believe, do not want to believe me! But Seddok is out there! And I'm not a dreamer or a compulsive liar like the newspapers say! Now who could that be, Josette? Hello? Who? No, no sir, the papers have treated me very poorly. Oh, I should think so! Really? His paper is ready to make a formal apology on behalf of all the press? What they are reporting is absurd, ridiculous! An evil genius gorilla...! Now? Really... no, no, I have no comment. But... I was going to bed! Here at the corner bar... Oh, well... give me 5 minutes to get ready! Oh my... the 5 minutes of a lady, of course! Goodbye! No! Help! Good evening! - Doctor. Strangled first, then the usual wound. Wide-eyed... Seddock! I can't find peace, it was my article that killed her! There's plenty of blame to go around. But did you really say so much? - There were stories in other papers too... If I had not written that she lived alone, and where... No... it's because of the monster she called... Seddok! We should call it something else. - No, Seddok! But no! - I know it sounds absurd, but either it exists, or something similar does! It is indeed as if she had been killed by a ghost! Another ghost that... this is bestial sadism! Claws that sink, rummage, excise... The same characteristics that we... - Thank you, that's enough, doctor! What characteristics? - I'll talk to you later. See you soon! Come, Valeme! - Goodbye! I feel... - I am a very busy man. - I'm sorry to say... - No... Come on, hurry, get the bar set up! Arlette! Why must you always be late, eh? I'm all ready to go! - Well, look who's here! Pierre! - Ah! Arlette... - It's been ages! How are you? Don't tell me you've been pining for me? Well, I have, if you want to know! - Hi Ivonne! Am I wrong or are you getting fatter? - It's becoming, isn't it? Hey, Pierre is back! - Lieutenant! Good evening! I'll get you a carton of cigarettes if you play me something, but only for me, you hear! - Hey, lets get with it, boys, we have a paying customer! Sit down! Sometimes it hurts, doesn't it? It doesn't matter... in fact, bravo! You have done very well Eh? Eh? Ah, yes, yes, I know... I know it was Monique who taught you. Radio: In local news, Seddok, the murdering monster, is the day's hottest story! Paul Lerois, the brilliant journalist... - Sacha! Jeanette has not come down yet? You can pick that up later! Go get her! Radio: ...although a pathological liar, she herself was the monster's third victim. The question remains as to why Seddok killed her? The answer is not known at this time, but with the elimination of the only witness, she was perhaps the only person in the world who came face-to-face with the murderer and knew...is it man or monster? She's not there? You've looked everywhere? Jeanette! Sacha...help me! Jeanette! The Garonne... Pierre Mornet's ship... and it docked just today...! Where is the key to the front gate? Idiot! Hurry...come with me! Hey lady, you'll catch cold... come aboard! No thanks... I'd rather wait down here Pierre! I can't believe it... Jeanette! Jeanette... You've recovered... Why didn't they tell me at the clinic when I looked for you? They told me you would always be disfigured! Didn't ever want to see me! It was the truth, Pierre! The truth, I swear! Didn't you know I looked everywhere for you? Jeanette, where have you been? You can tell me. What happened to you? Didn't you receive my letter? - What letter? Oh Pierre, take me away, I'm so frightened! - Of what? Tell me...ahhh! There's a man in the water there! - I heard a splash! - There he is! Lieutenant! Lieutenant Mornet! And you're positive that she's the same person? There's no doubt about it! And this one showing the scars was given to me at the clinic! Yes, yes, the photographs are of the same girl, I agree. But I was referring to the person you met tonight on the waterfront... you don't think that... - Oh, no commissioner! It was her, right in front of me! But in the dark... with the fog and all... - But I know her, I couldn't possibly be mistaken! There's no Jeanette Moreneau listed with the Bureau of Missing Persons. But she's not a missing person...! She's here! I've seen her! She has no relatives in town... Even if she'd been kidnapped... Listen, you know I want to believe you... I remember the auto accident from which Jeanette Moreneau barely escaped with her life... but this story of a recovery is impossible! Yet, she's cured! Perfectly normal! It's her same face! But who would be likely to hide such a miracle as that? Whoever it was who tried to kill me! - For what reason? An hour ago, in Rue Dormeille, police sergeant Vandelle recovered a stolen automobile. This is the license number. You want to rejuvinate me? How long has it been since I've bothered about stolen cars? The same automobile, a short time before, at about the same time the assault occured was stopped for speeding just past the waterfront by patrolman Cholenne. Inside, as well as the driver, there was an unconscious woman and a doctor taking her to the hospital. - You see? - Did you check the hospital? I've already called, there's no record of her. - Maybe he took her to a private clinic? The name of the doctor? Well, sir, Cholenne didn't bother to ask him that, under the circumstances. It could have been a doctor who commandeered the first automobile he found! Or a clever criminal... who would say anything to avoid identifying himself! ...or the woman - Jeanette! Perhaps... There happens to be a real doctor who might give us some information about this miraculous recovery. Will you let me come with you? - Yes, but on one condition... ... no, I'll tell you in the car! Ah! Good evening Professor Levin, please excuse us if we're... Oh... this is police sergeant Durant... Marette, I think you already know! Excuse the interruption if we're disturbing you at this hour, but passing in front of your villa I thought, why don't I leave it up to you, Professor Levin, to clarify a scientific problem we have... You were so extremely kind to me when we met each other that time before in those unfortunate circumstances. - oh, yes... ...my poor assistant had passed away, Monique Riviere. You may go, Sacha. Sacha... he's a strange one! He's my factotum, cares for the garden more than anything. A mute, a soul of fidelity, an expert with flowers ...the classic one to suspect in a mystery story ...if there were anything to suspect, Durant! Can I offer you a drink Inspector? - Yes, yes! Let's be comfortable! We must try to make it easy for Professor Levin to forget that we're policemen! Did you notice these bottles? He got them as a souvenir of Hiroshima... - Interesting, aren't they, Durant? You don't have to blow smoke under my nose! - Excuse me! Here you are... - Thank you! If you please! Now, then, inspector? - Ah...I'll make it brief... Look here, Professor, have you been following an Eclair Soir, all that tommyrot about Seddok, the monster? - Not closely... Tommyrot is the right word for it, cheap sensational journalism! Chief? - All right, go out and smoke! If you don't mind, that is! - But I... I still don't comprehend The time before I asked you a question which you were kind enough to say was intelligent about the psychological reaction of the victims of an atomic explosion... Well, then... perhaps my own supposition will be an absurd one... but think of the ships that arrive here from Japan? And this, ah, Seddok... is it possible that he's one of those? I see... you've been impressed by the recurring factor in these cases of the wound from the throat to the sternum the obsession of a vindictive minded man who has been poisoned or disfigured forever by atomic radiation... one might even say, a vampire of the atom age who wants to recover! Exactly! What do you say? - The hypothesis is melodramatic...but not to be excluded. You said the hypothesis is melodramatic, but the fact that you don't exclude it altogether puts me, how shall I say, more at peace with my own conscience. We mustn't let our feet get too far off the ground! - Chief... the photograph? Ah, right... excuse me, I had another purpose in coming here to see you... Look here, examine these two photos. Do you believe a woman reduced to this state might recover altogether? What I mean is... without any scar... without a trace... I should say not! This state of disfiguration is permanent! Nevertheless, Professor... - Let me do the talking, Durant! Nevertheless, there is someone who swears he's seen this woman, the way she was! That's impossible! - And if there did exist a cure, a practice we never heard of? Any man who discovered it would be a celebrity, and I assure you I'd be the first to envy him. I imagine so! - All right then... This other photo, which was given to me as proof of her actual recovery must have been taken at some time prior to her accident. Pity...the signature was not dated... Ah, right, it wasn't, and besides, even if it had been, it could easily have been faked. Professor, I'm ready to swear that these... - Durant! We've been disturbing you long enough, we're most grateful, Professor. I'll accompany you. - Thank you! Marette? We're leaving... Durant! Professor... you must feel rather lonely here! Such a big house... don't you have a new assistant? Do you think its so simple to find one? And moreover, I'm enjoying a period of repose right now. I merely study for relaxation. You know, Professor, what I envy you is your gardner, Sacha! - Really? A bit difficult to believe that. It's just that I'm a flower gardener on my days off. - Imagine, inspector, he even works at night! Maybe he's expecting a frost... - I know what you mean... You've been dying to have a look inside that greenhouse, but I don't think at this hour... No, no, indeed... Sacha would be delighted to have you look in. I'll wait for you in the car. - What for? Why don't you come too, Durant? This way! This is Sacha's kingdom, they're his plants, they're his roses... Sacha, you're honored... these gentlemen have come to admire your beautiful greenhouse! It's really beautiful, too! - Well, you ought to know... Flowers, nothing else is of any interest. And Sacha's always busy with them. He doesn't even have time to read mystery stories. - Yes, and no wonder... Well, good night, Professor, and excuse us again! - Sacha, accompany the gentlemen to the gate. Durant, aren't you coming? Good night, Professor! - Good night! Jeanette... What is the purpose of this autopsy? - Now Doctor... I've already arranged for the body to be exhumed, and I must ask that you proceed without any further arguements! - Very well sir. Good morning! - Good morning! Garage? I want my car at the door in 10 minutes. - Good morning, Doctor! You want a cigarette, Chief? Listen, Marette, I've just had an idea... I want you to keep that villa of Professor Levin's under observation - Do you think that... - Yes! Well? - Hi Chief! - You want a good lesson, eh? Please bring me some coffee! Commander? I came to say goodbye. You're resigning? Pierre, why not let the police handle this matter... I can't risk it. - Maybe you're right. Have you notified the company? - No, I wanted to talk with you first. - Thank you. I don't think you'll easily be replaced. If I ever took another command, or a promotion, I was hoping you'd take this ship! - Thank you! If only I could. - We could always divide the mothballs, you never know! Commander, the coffee! You take it, it's the last time I'll get to offer. Sacha, Sacha! Sacha, Sacha! Jeanette! What are shouting for? What's wrong with you? No, let go of me! I want to get out of here! I'm afraid! Of me? Of the man whom you owe everything to and who loves you? You're not telling the truth! You want to go back to Pierre! But I'm going to save you now in spite of yourself! Yes, I want to go to Pierre! I don't care if I'm scarred for life, because I know now that he will love me anyway! - You think so? Why, your scars are already returning! Embryonic still, and all but invisible... but if this action is not arrested almost immediately you will turn into just what you were before... Yes! It will get worse! It will devour you bit by bit! It will transform you into an animal, like a monster, in the very eyes of your Pierre! I don't want to stay here anymore! I don't want to! Listen... I give you my word of honor, it will only take a few days... perhaps only one day for the last application. And then you'll be cured forever, free to go where you please with whom you please! If you're ungrateful enough to leave me for a man who's done nothing for you, you deserve nothing else. But until you're cured, don't try any more to run away. Don't try to see anyone... will you promise this? Look here. I'll even give this back to you... you have no more reason to kill yourself. What is it? Who? The police... the Inspector? Pierre! There's someone here? - It is... Pierre...! Sacha! Let her go. Yes, go to him, let him see you. Leave here with him now! Remember? I made you a promise and I will keep it. It's your decision... But first, help me to succeed. "Albert" is not speaking to you now, but rather "Professor Levin". I must succeed... this is all I ask for. Is the Brigadier still here? I'm sorry to bother you... Isn't disturbing me your job? I'm not with the police. - Ah, no? Then why were you pretending earlier to be a cop? Because the Commissioner... - It was my fault. I was so anxious that they allowed me to accompany them. But we came here so late at night we had no time to explain everything. - Please. Everything? That you are personally interested in the case of that girl... What's her name... ah, yes, Jeanette Moreneau. You were very convincing as a cop. Well, you guessed it right, Professor. And it is true... the photo signed by Jeanette was taken prior to the accident. But I... I saw her...! Her, Jeanette! Yesterday, right in front of me! As beautiful as before, at the port where my ship docks! As certainly as I am speaking to you! And if I wasn't attacked... - You were attacked? Yes, from behind! Something happened to Jeanette, and I was going to find out what it was. You love her... it is obvious. But perhaps you were just emotionally lost after the separation. What do you know about it? - Don't forget, I am also a psychiatrist. She lives deep in your heart, and in your obssession to find her, you are able to see her in every woman you meet. And perhaps yesterday at the dock you saw Jeanette where she sometimes waited for you after a trip. - No, it was no hallucination! And then, why would I be attacked? Perhaps it was a robbery. Yes, it wouldn't be the first time at that port... - See? And perhaps it was foggy... Maybe you were a bit drunk... No, I've seen her...! I've seen her! What can I do to help you? Help me to convince the police that this miraculous cure is possible. Then they will continue searching instead of treating her like a ghost! I've already excluded that possibility. Then I should give up all hope? If I were in your place... I would give up. No! I love Jeanette too much., And I would not care if she was ugly or deformed, if I could just find her again! And what if she is a changed woman? Yes, a woman that is no longer yours... and who does not love you anymore... - I refuse to believe that! I can see that there is nothing more I can do for you. I'm sorry. Thank you, Professor. - No, no need to thank me, it's nothing... Sacha! Accompany the gentleman. - Goodbye Professor. Goodbye. You don't have to tell me your real name. I don't believe we will meet again. You heard his voice, you had only to open the door, and you did not! I did not because... - You did not! I know I could rely on you, and in an hour, I have to leave. I have to do again what no man has ever done for his wife. Tomorrow you will have no scars... Oh, if only I could tell you the truth! What truth? Wait... I'll be back in a couple hours. Follow him! Very good...in his automobile? Have you arranged for reinforcements? Take all precautions... exactly where is he at the moment? Let's take a seat! Is this seat occupied? No, please! Have any cigarettes? - No, not even one. - Well, I'm going to go buy some. I'll need them if we have to watch the whole movie! - Get some for me Gitane. - And thanks! No distractions! I'll get cigarettes and come right back. Be careful. - Yes, yes, its okay. Can you see all right? - Watch yourself now, buster.. keep your hands to yourself, eh? May I have a light please? Thank you! Ahhhh! Help, help! Help! Murderer! Call the police! Yes? Another woman...? In the waterfront neighborhood again? Well, is the woman dead? That's a blessing... Yes? Yes, naturally, and alarms throughout the zone, and declare an emergency! Seddok! - ...Seddok... Or someone impersonating him... But it seems like my suspicion is wrong in this case. Professor Levin has an alibi... and an airtight alibi! Alibi? ...Marette, let's go! And don't waste any time! Where? Commander Delage at the pier? - Come, I told you! I'll call in 15 minutes! - Right! Professor Levin? He sat through the whole film, and then he went out. Gerarde's tailing him. We were waiting here for further instructions. - I told you, Chief! Were you both inside the whole time? - Well, we both took turns. - He didn't move once? Not once! Let's go in! - Lerois! - Ah, what are YOU up to? I've got to come clean with you Chief. If you won't let me chase Seddok, then I'll chase you. As you can see, it's your own fault! Well, from now on, you mind your own business, get me? - That's your orders, Chief! Where was he sitting? - He never moved once! - Where was he sitting, I asked? Right here, Inspector, in this row here. This one, he was sitting in this seat. - And you never let him out of your sight, eh? Well, uh, I slipped outside for a few minutes to buy some cigarettes... But I never let him out of sight! And who was there sitting next to you? If what I think is true, you'll be back on a beat in uniform! That reminds me, what was he wearing? Yes.. what did he have on? He was wearing a camel hair coat, Inspector! Yeah, that's like opening the phonebook to the name "Smith"! He sat here, you say? - Right here! Where were you two sitting? - We were back there. Yes, that's right! Inspector, headquarters told me I would probably find you here! The autopsy I did on Monique Riviere... it's incredible, I'll never forgive myself. You mean... like the others? And this stuff... what do you think it is? It's blood, there's no doubt about that! I don't know if it's human or... - And what else did you think it might be? Have it examined right away. The rest of you, come with me! I don't want to lose her, but I no longer have the courage to kill, not even to save her life! I don't have the strength left... I'm not the same thing, I'm not what I was before. I'm not the same! I have to tell her, it's finished, I've failed! But I don't want to lose her. Jeanette? Please forgive me. It's too late now to make any difference. And there's nothing more I can do to help you, no hope of your recovery! You will remain as you... no... it's impossible! The treatments have taken effect at last! We are saved, do you hear me? Saved! Come, get up now Jeanette, we must leave! - I don't believe you! But you're completely cured, and it's forever! It was I who did it... just when I began to think... Come on, get dressed, don't lose any more time, we must get away from here as soon as possible! Get away? - Yes, at once! - No! - Have you lost your mind? The police suspect me! - The police were here? Don't ask me to explain it to you! Hurry! - I'll hurry, but I'm not going to leave with you! - Jeanette! You made me a promise, and this is my decision! - You... Jeanette, I want what is mine! I've even killed for you! I... I beg you... I've unleashed a horrible force within me that I can no longer control... you alone can help me stop it! Tell me that you will never abandon me now! Noo...! Let me in... you begin to understand now... Tell me you belong to me, that you will run away with me, it's my only hope of salvation! Then you will see again the man who you came to for help, and who loved you so much! No, it's horrible! - Jeanette? Let go of me! Pull the trigger, and murder the man who condemned himself for you! Have that much courage at least, because in a moment or two you will go mad! Mad with horror you don't know! That's right, don't look at me, it's better that you don't. But believe me when I say you can still save me if you will say to me.. - No, I can't stand it! No... No? So you say no? Well then get dressed! I'll give you one minute and no more! You're coming with me, whether you want to or not! I don't know what will become of us, it doesn't matter anymore, but you will never see your Pierre again! You're mine... mine! I'd kill you first! Now get dressed! Albert... have you no pity? Pity? That's what I ask of YOU...I! Noo! Help! Help! - Jeanette! Help! - Jeanette! Jeanette... Jeanette I'll kill you! - No, let me go, help! Let me go! - No one will ever have you! Come away with me, come with me... - No... no! No! Jeanette, Jeanette! - Help! Help Pierre! - Jeanette! Pierre! - Jeanette! Pierre, Pierre! No... no! Pierre... Pierre.... Pierre! Pierre... Pierre! Pierre! No! Sacha... Sacha! Help me Sacha... I am your master! Your master! I am Levin, Sacha! Jeanette! Jeanette... we must hide her as we did before! Sacha! Inspector, watch out! Levin! Look there! Fire a volley through the windowpane! Come out, Levin! Come out with your hands up! Pierre! -Jeanette! Stay back! Yes... I must kill you... Yes... I must kill you too, Jeanette... Jeanette... Jeanette... - Oh, Pierre, Pierre! Take that man out of here! Well, come on...give me a light! The End FanSubs by HellRazor
