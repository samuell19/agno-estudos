My name is Lucia Dos Santos. When I was ten years old an extraordinary event changed my life forever. I was touched by the supernatural and blessed with a secret. A secret I have kept without reservation My superiors have now asked me to write it all down, the memories stored in my heart. It was 1917 The innocence of the world was fading. Kings had been shot, and brothers fought against brothers. It was also a time of revolution. In Russia the Bolsheviks were preparing to seize power. They had declared the Church an enemy of the people and their words spread like poison in the hearts of men. In Portugal the monarchy had been overthrown and replaced with a Republican government, intent on the elimination of all religion within two generations. May God forgive you, Arturo dos Santos. But in Fatima, it seemed - for us, we were lucky our lives went on almost as normal. My father owned a large plot of land, the Cova de lria As my brothers and sisters before me, I came to an age when it became my duty to look after our sheep. All the village children worked as I did often grazing their flocks together. They always asked me to come and join them But I preferred my own company. Although two of the children usually made a point of coming to find me my young cousins - Jacinta and Francisco. Lucia! Jacinta wanted to be my little helper and always insisted her devoted brother.. Come with her to join me in the fields. They were inseparable. Well, as long as you know we won't be playing games all day. Francisco was a gentle boy. He always did as his little sister asked, never protesting or becoming impatient with her. He was a quiet and sensitive soul very like his father thoughtful and compassionate. And not at all like our little Jacinta who had to be the centre of attention, and if she didn't get what she wanted, she would sulk until we gave in. Are you going to sit there all day? Probably... But the one thing that could always distract her and lighten her mood - she loved to dance and Francisco loved to play for her. This is how life was for us... until the 13th of May. At first we thought a storm was coming. It was as though the whole world was holding it's breath Then we saw her. A lady more brilliant than the sun. She spoke... do not be afraid, I am from heaven, I could feel her love wash over me, like a wave She asked us if we would be willing to suffer for God For our suffering would save so many sinners When we said yes... the light of heaven pierced my heart and filled my soul. We agreed between us that we shouldn't speak of this to anyone. But Jacinta was so overcome - her enthusiasm was too much. Stop Jacinta! We mustn't tell anyone! She just had to talk about the lady of light. What lady? Not just any lady... Our Lady, ...and she appeared right in front of them! A sign from heaven! I didn't say it was Our Lady... Lucia, what is this all about? Lucia... Lucia... It's true momma. We saw her come down from heaven and she was so beautiful momma. It's blasphemy! That's what it is! I don't know how you could make up such lies! If Francisco and Jacinta say they saw something at the Cova then I believe them. You can believe what you like, ...but I tell you these lies will bring the wrath of God down upon our heads. I don't know what you are playing at my girl but you will stop this nonsense right now, before it gets out of hand. Do you hear me? But it's true... Do you hear mel? But it's true momma! Stop lying... Stop lying... Stop it! Stop it Lucia! But momma, it's true momma... Maria... Maria... Am I the only one with any sense here? Come on children. As if I don't have enough to worry about without my youngest making up such things. Maybe she did see a beautiful lady floating in the sky? This is all your fault! I told you about filling their heads with silly fairy stories! Father Ferreira will know what to do! I'll shall take her to him, first thing. You say the woman spoke with you? Yes Padre What did she say? She told us not to be afraid Did she say anything else? From the start I was inspired by the Lady to answer so that I neither lied, nor revealed the things she wanted us to keep secret. I told them she said we should pray the rosary every day, and that she had asked us to return at the same hour on the 13th day of every month for six months, and she would perform a miracle so that all could see. I don't know why she is making up such wicked lies Padre... She has always been such a good child. I'm not making it up Padre, I'm not. Padre, surely you do not believe that the virgin Mary appeared to these children? I believe this child saw something, and that it was indeed of supernatural origin but... I do not believe it to be a revelation from heaven It is usual in such cases for Our Lord to tell the souls to whom he makes such communication to give their confessor, or parish priest an account of what has happened but... this child, on the contrary, She keeps as much as she can to herself. Father Ferreira's final wordsfilled me with terrible doubts. She's always been such a good child... I'm not making it up... I believe she saw something. I do not believe it was a revelation from heaven... It's the devil! The grace of god is my strength... The grace of god is my strength... Every night my dreams were plagued by those doubts and fears. And my days were filled with torment If it's not the little saint herself If it's not the little saint herself Witch more like... So many saints and angels in the house... it's a wonder the children can get in... ...and in the weeks that followed, the world that I had known, slowly turned against me... Don't you see her Lucia, a lady floating above your house? Don't you see her Lucia? What makes you so special Lucia Dos Santos? She gets it from her mother... They used to burn people like you at the stake. What makes you so special Lucia dos Santos... These lies will bring the wrath of God down upon our heads... They used to burn people like you at the stake.., Witch...witch...witch I said I would never go back there, however much my cousins pleaded with me. I made up my mind, I would not see her anymore... ...but, on the day that she said she would return, l felt myself drawn back to the Cova, like a moth to a flame. She was so beautiful, so good. I had to return, I had to see her face again, and feel the love in her smile. And where are you going? It's the thirteenth You really believe those children? What if it's true Lilly? I'll be home for supper. You'll be the only one there! You silly old fool...! Lucia, you came Look look... I cant see anything Ssshhh Listen... lasked her what it was that she wanted of me, she said for me to pray the Rosary for peace, and then she told me that l must learn to read and write, for I would make her message known to the world. From that day on more and more people came to the Cova - some looking for cures, others to ask us questions, all of them with faith re-kindled in their hearts. And with this renewed faith came a courage that had not surfaced before. They built a shrine at the Cova, a beacon of hope to be seen by all. The fires of superstition can do terrible damage if they are not contained. I fully understand the seriousness of the situation, I assure you of that. Of course. We have great faith in you Arturo. How dare you come into this house smelling of drink! I've had one drink. Don't lie to me! Alright, I had a few drinks... I've been talking business. Business? What kind of business? With Sancho Guoterez. We can do without help from the likes of him. I went to the cova today, everything has either been trampled on by the crowds or been eaten by their animals. Sancho said he could help us. Help himself more like, we can manage without his kind of help. Is this the house of Lucia Dos Santos? Will you people give us no rest? When will it be enough? When you have taken every item of her clothing? Every lock of her hair? Please, please, why won't you help us? I can't take much more of this... Why is she doing this to us? I just don't understand why she is doing this to us. Take her to see the priest again? I'll take the broom handle to her, that's what I'll do! I'll beat these wicked lies out of her once and for all... So help me God I will! Please, please, open the door. Why won't you open the door? I wanted to tell my mother that it wasn't true - to ease her fears, but from the cradle she had taught us that above all, we must always tell the truth. And I remembered how the Lady had told me that she would be my comfort and my strength. The day my sister left... I held on to those words. Even as I felt my heart breaking. Mama's found work for me as a servant for a rich family, She said we need the money. We don't have enough to eat. Hurry up else you'll be late. From now on, if you want something to eat you have to eat what grows at the Cova I offered my suffering to God and thought of all the souls that I was saving. Well, I think it is a pity for them. Maria Santos? She likes to give herself airs. Now she's a laughing stock - serves her right. And have you seen the state of their land? Ruined! So many feet trampling... crops all gone you know. And what did you see? Nothing! It was difficult... so many people - but I heard. A tiny voice, like... music. Maybe next time. If there is a next time. They say the Government will send men to block the roads - soldiers - with guns, maybe cannons. Cannons! Huh! They sayall sorts, doesn't mean it's true. Maria from the mill says her aunt could barely hobble there with the pain in her bad leg - but she skipped all the way home. That was the wine! Shhh - you can't say that! No - it's true. She had a bad sore, now it's completely dry. I've told everybody, my sister-in-law's told her cousins. Next time There will be so many people they won't dare stop us. If those little children aren't afraid to go - then neither should we! The apparition of the 13th July was different. The Lady appeared just as she had before. But this time there was a sadness about her, and when she opened her hands It was not heaven's warmth that embraced us, but the fires of hell. Then, she showed us a city half in ruins and said, that unless people turn to God, he will punish the world with a second world war within the next generation. To prevent this she would come back to ask for the Pope to consecrate Russia to her Immaculate Heart. If then we still did not act on her requests, Godless men will spread their communism throughout the world, causing war...famine.. ...and persecutions of the Church. The good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have much to suffer. Above us, we saw an angel... shouting... Penance - Penance - Penance He pointed the sword towards the earth as if to set the world on fire. But the flames were stopped by the splendour that Our Lady radiated towards him She said,in the end her Immaculate Heart will triumph and a period of peace will be granted to the world. That's my daughter! We are going home. What did she say? What's happened? These crowds... they're dangerous, a powder-keg. Afew rabble-rousers, a voluble cleric and we could have a riot on our hands. That would not look well for me in Lisbon... Do we understand each other? Certainly. The children - they need to answer some questions - in the public interest. For the records Which must be thorough We have worked too long for the priests to undermine us with more fairy-tales... But no violence! I want no martyrs here! The things we had seen had changed us. Francisco became even more withdrawn from the world. And even Jacinta preferred solitude to the continual questions we had now come to endure. So we spent our days up in the hills, hiding from the world. So we spent our days up in the hills, hiding from the world. But... we could not hide forever. On the morning of the next apparition, the Administrator, Senhor de Oliveira Santos came looking for us. He said he wanted to take us to see Father Ferreira, who had questions for us all. This won't take long... And when we're done, I'll take you to the Cova myself. That way you'll avoid all the crowds on the road hmm? Besides, I'd like to see one of these monthly miracles with my own eyes... And maybe I will believe too... Just like Thomas, hmmm? He did not take us to Father Ferreira. He took us back with him to the Government Headquarters in Ourem. Come with me. Come on. You three have caused quite a stir. It must be exciting... to have your names in the newspapers? Ummmh? You don't look excited, you look frightened. Well you should be... thousands of people are probably standing in a field right now, waiting for some kind of miracle to happen. How do you thinkthey will feel when nothing happens? Please Senor, you must let us go, you must. We promised her. Ah yes, the lady that floats in the sky hummm? Is it true this lady confided a secret to you? Yes Senor Well, What was it? I can't tell you Senor, we promised not to tell anyone. Do you thinkthis is some sort of game? Withholding important information from the government, is an offense punishable by death! I'll ask the Lady Senor, and if she gives permission, I will tell you. Permission? Maybe if I tell you how you will die, it will loosen your tongues. There is a couldron out back" filled with boiling oil... You will be lowered in to the cauldron, slowly, an inch at a time... the flesh will be boiled off your bones. I will tell you what I am going to do, I am going to give you a little time... to think over the seriousness of your situation. Make yourselves at home. Are you the ones who everyone has been talking about? The children of Fatima... They are supposed to hear messages from heaven They put you in the one place in the whole of Portugal where no one can hear your prayers! Where are the children? They've lied to us! Oh Jacinta, Didn't the lady say that we would have to suffer much? Think of all the souls we will save. Don't cry, don't be afraid. Do any of you ladies know how to dance? I will always picture Jacinta as she was on that day, afraid, with tear-stained cheeks, and dancing. It wasn't supposed to end this way It doesn't matter, there is no where else I'd rather be. Well well well... You, you will stop that now, or there will be trouble. And you - Shouldn't you be praying? There are some say that our Lady came down to the Holm oak in the form of a small blue cloud, and finding we were not there - rose again to heaven. Look Lucia, look at the lamps of the angels shining brightly in the sky. Are they really the lamps of the angels? Of course... And the moon - That is the lamp of Our Lady It's so beautiful... He has gone too far. God hear me! Do something now. What chance have we against rifles and guns? hmmm? Go home. We can take them.We are many. We are strong... Go back to your homes all of you! Down with the administrator! Down with the administrator! Down with the administrator! Down with the administrator! Why don't you just tell them this secret? Then they'll let you go home. I would rather die! Is it something good, or something bad, this secret? Good for some and... bad for others You three, come with me. Come on. Well? What is it to be? I have tried to save you, but as you won't co-operate, there is nothing else I can do. Guard! Is the oil good and hot? Boiling. Take the little one and throw her in. What kind of boy are you? Hmmm? To allow your own sister to go to such a death. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you... Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb... Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. She's fried. I'm not afraid to die! I'm not afraid! I'm not afraid! It will be you next Lucia. Unless you tell me the secret... or admit it was all lies... hmmm? I would rather die! Very well! You shall! I no longer felt any fear for myself - only joy that I would soon be going to Heaven. You're free to go. We were free - free to return home. ...but there was no welcome for me there. In October, the rains came. My mother said that it was heaven's way of putting an end to childish nonsense, but to me, it was the tears of the Angel s weeping for all those who would never believe. And I prayed, that the miracle that the Lady promised us, would be big enough for the whole world to see. Who's with Santos? Can't you guess? Oh... A Reporter? So... What do you really think? Is it make-believe? Or... divine inspiration? Ithinkit is God's will. God's will? Not just children's imaginings, then? No Senor,they do not imagine. No? My Lucia does not lie - her cousins do not lie. You must understand - I have to question these things. You and every other outsider who comes here thinking they know best. My crops are ruined. The Cova is ruined. Every day more and more people swarm on to my land like locusts. My family is suffering... You resent this 'favouritism' of God's? It is pointless to resent what is out of our hands. I've seen them.The Little Seers... Really? In jail.They came and prayed with us. The government doesn't want us poor people knowing about the greatness of Our Lady. We've heard they're going to throw bombs into the crowd this time! Who says? Lots of people. But you're still going? Oh Senor-there is going to happen a miracle. Who wouldn't risk his life for a miracle? You seem very sure... Senor... I have talked to the children, the little Seers. I believe them. They... converted you? They opened my eyes. And I thought it was sheep-pens you went in for opening! I don't mind you asking questions, 'specially while you're buying wine, but not everyone here is simply a gullible peasant. You don't share his optimism? I believe what I can see with my eyes and touch with my hands. So... You're not going to the Cova? Of course I am! We all are! They say 100,000 may come. Would you want your grandchildren to ask about a miracle in your village, and you have to tell them 'I wasn't there'? And if there is no miracle? Maria... Could it be that this is all God's will, in punishment for my sins? If this is all God's work... Then praise be to God. I have been told more than once today, what will happen if nothing happens tomorrow. I do not think they will harm the children. How do you know what they are capable of? Look, why don't you stay here tomorrow... I will go with the children. This is not about you proving what a big hero you are Ti Marto. No... It's about proving what kind of father I am. I'm going with you. Could it be that this is all God's will, in punishment for my sins? It's about proving what kind of father I am. Lucia, Come, it is time to get you ready... Come If you must go, then I will go and die with you. Ave Maria, Mai de Deus, rogai por nos pecadores... We will each be judged by our actions, this day. You should not have let the children go. Lambs amongst wolves. What if she doesn't come today? What if she won't come anymore? She promised. Show us the sign, show us the sign. We have been cheated. We have all allowed ourselves to be deceived! You have made fools of us! The parents are to blame. Making the rain stop, that would be a good sign! The little fools - they're laughing at you. Saints! Is that what you think they are? Whoever wants to go... can go... but I'm not. Our Lady told us to come, she will be here soon! It's stopped raining. What do you want from me? Of all the things said to us that day, what impressed me most deeply was her tender sorrow. She said that we must turn to God, for he is already so much offended. She spoke so gently, but with so much pain. I wanted to spread her words throughout the whole world. Show us a sign! Will she take us to see heaven? I want so much to see heaven. She told me that she would take Francisco and Jacinta to heaven very soon, - but I would have to stay. Am I to stay here alone? She told me not to be afraid, for she would be with me always. We have been cheated, we have been cheated! Holy Queen of the Rosary, you promised a miracle, will you show them a sign so that people will believe? It's a miracle! I can see! I can see! God! forgive us! My God! How great is your power! They say 70,000 people saw the sun dance that day - and my whole world changed forever, always there were people, always questions. Everybody wanted to meet the Little Seers - to pray with them - to ask them for Our Lady's help. We became curiosities. It was not long before heaven kept its promise to my cousins. After the war, the influenza came. I do not remember how many weeks Francisco suffered, but he never complained, not once. He took his flight to heaven on the fourth of April in 1919 Jacinta joined him a year later. Don't cry Papa, I'm going to heaven. Her final sacrifice to Our Lady, was to die alone, in a hospital, in Lisbon. On the 20th February. Lucia... Lucia... I'm coming Mama I am told that there is a language in which the word Fatima means peace. It is my hope that Fatima will remain always, a light in the dark, a light that will lead us to peace.
