Come here. Come here, boo, don't play cute. Come on. Come here. I want to show you something. Come here. Come here. Come here. Now you're looking handsome. What are you looking at? Lacey, Willy, I told you not to spy on us! No! Leave me alone! Let me go! Mama! What are you doing here? I told you to go, now get. Go on. I'm sorry we have to go through this one again, babe. Take it off. I don't like it anymore. Come on. Stop it, I don't like it anymore. Take it off. Oh, God! Willy! Willy! May the Holy Spirit guide our youth in all their endeavors throughout this year. Let us pray to the Lord. Let the Lord deliver us from evil and grant us peace in our days. Let us pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. I can't escape it. That night. It still haunts me and there must be a reason. I'm afraid something's going to happen. I know it is hard for you. All we can do is pray. Because you said the Lord is my refuge, no calamity will befall you. Lacey. Could you get that last load out of the washer? I already did, Aunt Helen. Oh, you're such an angel. Mom, can we go down to the river now? No, dear. Not today. Tomorrow, we'll go fishing. These things are almost dry. Might as well get going with the ironing. Why don't you leave it? I'll get to it after dinner. But I want to go fishing now. Well, I've got to go get dinner. Otherwise Kevin's gonna have nothing in his stomach tonight. Hey. Father Riley. Hello, Ernest. Good to see you again. Good to see you. Finally got some nice weather, huh? Came just in time. So how's the family? Fine. Lacey picked herself a good man in Jake. And Willy. Good, steady lad. Hey, Willy! Come say hello to Father Riley! Of course, it would help if the boy could talk. Hello, Willy. You look in great shape. You seem to have a real love for this land. Once you're done in the barn, Willy, why don't you give the man a hand loading the silo. Well, see you, Willy. You know, I could do with a nice, cold drink. Oh, Father, I wish we'd known you were coming. Jake's gonna be so sorry to have missed you. Yeah, I suppose I should have called first, but when I saw you in church Sunday I realized I hadn't stopped by for a chat in a long time. Father Riley, good to see you again. Helen, hello! Say, Father, why don't you stay for dinner? Well, I really shouldn't, I've got... Oh, please do. We're having roast chicken. And acorn squash and beans. And some of your favorite wine to go with it. Honey, I'm glad you're home! Hi, honey. I decided to leave a little earlier today. Great. Things calm down at the office? Are you kidding? That place will never change. Kevin, dinner's ready! Bless us, O Lord, in these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ our Lord, amen. Amen. I don't like this soup. Don't you want to grow up to be big and strong like your daddy? How about some crackers? Oh, sorry. I knew I'd forgotten something. Aunt Helen, you stay right there. I'll go get them. Oh, Jake, you picked up the mail. So Jake, how's everything down at the station? Oh, things are really hopping. So we got this 911 number now. Of course, the state police don't have it. So we're getting about, oh, 80% of their calls. Not too serious. "Dear Lacey and Willy. A long time has passed. More than 20 years since I last saw you. I'm getting older and the doctor said I might not live very long. As your mother, I feel I have the right to see you at least one more time. I now live in Monroe, Georgia, and if you could just come see me..." Willy, what's the matter, dear? Willy? Don't worry. She's not our mother anymore. We have our own lives now. And we can't feel guilty for what happened 20 years ago. Jake, will you take care of the carving? Oh, sure, Helen. Hey, Kevin, you think we could both handle that? You betcha. That's great wine, Ernest. Willy, why don't you take the drumstick? It's nice and crispy. Let's hope this chicken tastes as good as it smells. You talk about a day. You know Old Clem down at Hojo's? Well, there we were again. Seems a couple of tourists came in and Old Clem was really acting up. So over to the office we went. Mmmm, it's really delicious. My compliments to the chef, Helen. Thank you, Father. The language. You wouldn't believe the language. Incredible wine. Pretty good, eh? Is there more? Yeah, there's more in the pantry. Honey, you don't mind, do you? Oh, sure. Lacey, what is it? Oh, nothing. I don't wanna go to bed! Yes, you do. No use fighting. It's bedtime. Phew, what dirty feet you have. You want a story tonight? Uh-huh, the pig story. You want the pig story? Okay. First we have to brush your teeth. And maybe wash your feet. Maureen never wrote us at all. I haven't the slightest idea what she's been doing all these years. Well, just remember, Helen. Things have a way of turning out for the best. Goodnight now. Call me if you need me. "As your mother, I feel I have the right to see you at least one more time." "One more time." "One more time." First, we squeeze the toothpaste. Now the brush goes to the little mouth. Open wide. Open up. Okay, now spit. Jake, you scared me. I just came up to say goodnight to Kevin. Hey, Kevin, how about a piggyback ride? Come on, hop on. Do a little horsey ride. Ride down the stairs. Lacey! It's Jake, honey. It's all right. There, there. It's all right. Jake. I'm scared, Jake. Lacey, there's nothing to be frightened about. I can't get away from it. It keeps haunting me. I don't want to remember. And I'm not gonna see my mother. Jake, please. Help me. Okay, Lacey. Let's get rid of these ghosts once and for all. But how? I think you should see your mother. And I think we should stop by the old house where you grew up as a child. I can't, Jake. I won't go there again! Ever! Lacey, if we just stop by and see who's living there now. No, Jake, I can't! I can't! Lacey! You're not gonna run away from your mother any longer. Or that house. There haven't been any problems that we haven't been able to solve so far, right? Just relax and let Lacey tell it her way. Go on, Lacey. I was about three years old and we were living in Virginia. Not far from here. Just across the Potomac. My father had already left. So it was just you and your brother Willy and your mother? Yes. Where was your father? I don't know. He left my mother before I was born. Did she go out with other men? Lacey, come on, honey. You've got to tell the doctor. And your brother lives with you? Yes. Doctor, I think you should know that her brother does not talk. He hasn't since that night 20 years ago. You're always talking about "that night." Do you want to tell me more about it, Lacey? Lacey. You are to tell me all about that night when you were three years old. Lacey. I'm listening. Willy and I. We were on the porch. Mommy told us to play outside. I'm cold. Someone's screaming. What's going on? Is that man hurting mommy? What man is there? What is he doing? I don't like that man. He scares me. He ties up Willy at night. Hits him. Mommy yells at me and I go to bed. You go to sleep right away? I'm in the kitchen now. There's a big knife. I take the knife and cut the ropes. He takes the knife. I follow him down the hall. Go into mommy's room. And then? I'll be back! I'm gonna get you! Slowly regain your normal consciousness. It's all right, it's all right. Jake, I'd like to ask you not to discuss Lacey's condition with the rest of the family. Tell me, doctor. Why was she talking like that? We will have to find out. Where is the mother now? Well, they haven't seen each other since that night. But yesterday, we got this letter from her. And I think this is what brought back all these memories. Hmm. They lived just across the river in Virginia. Is the house still there? I don't know, I guess so. Why? I want you to go back with her and take a look at it. You've got to convince her. She has to see the house and remember it the way it is now. Not the way it was 20 years ago. Listen, dear. Mommy and Daddy have to go away for a little while. But we'll be back after lunch. Then we'll go fishing, all right? Lacey, honey. You all set? Well, I was thinking... I promised to take Kevin fishing today. Maybe... Kevin, we'll be back in a few hours. Come on, Lacey, let's go. Bye, Aunt Helen. See ya later, Aunt Helen. You two planning on getting back for dinner? Yeah, we'll be back in a few hours. Bye. Come on, honey. Cheer up. Hello-o! Lacey? Anyone there? Oh. I thought no one was here. Hi, Willy. It's Katy. Lacey promised me some fresh eggs and she told me to come by and get them. Where is everybody? I'm sorry, Willy. As long as I know you, I can't keep in mind you don't talk. Well, hello there. Ooh, you're such a pretty boy. Finished? No? What's the matter, Willy? Something bothering you? You know, Willy, now that we're alone... I'll tell you a secret. Would you like me to tell you a secret? Willy. I'm talking to you. Whenever you're in church, I watch you. I look at you. But you don't look back. Willy, are you afraid of me? You know it doesn't matter to me that you don't talk. I think it's cute. Willy, you're so different from all the other boys. Come on, Willy. You know you can trust me. Willy. I just want to be close to you. Don't touch me! You're cra zy! Willy, what's going on here? Why are you painting the mirrors? I wonder who lives here. Hi. Were you sent by the real estate agent? Well, uh, yes. Mind if we come in? Well, this is the living room. My parents said if you like the furniture, you know, you can buy it. Fireplace works. And, oh, there's my sister Jane. Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm Jake. This is my wife, Lacey. Hi. It's a pretty nice house you live in here. Are your parents at work? Nah. They're gone for the weekend. So it's just you and Jane, right? Nah. There's my little brother, Timmy. Make yourselves at home. Take a look around. Thank you. Great. Come on, Lacey. Let's poke around a little. The sink is different. And I don't remember the shower. Or the bathtub. Boogeyman! Timmy! Are you up to your old number again? It still seems to work. Timmy, get out of here. Timmy really likes this place a lot. So do I, as a matter of fact. Pst! But my father's job's moving us out West. Hey, gorgeous! Pst! So you live on a farm across the river? What kind of farm? Well, there's various horses. Cattle. Lacey! Are you crazy or something? I saw him, Jake! He's here! Lacey! What is she talking about? I know I saw him. Are you all right? Well, I'm awfully sorry about this. My wife isn't feeling too well. Have you got a paper bag or something? I'll pick this up. What are you doing, Jake? I'm picking up the pieces of the mirror. Yeah, you better take that out of here. It's bad luck. Shut up, Timmy. Here you go. Thanks. I'll pay for this, of course. You think $50 will cover it? Oh, forget it. That thing was here when we moved in. What are you doing, Jake? Taking this damn thing back to the farm. I don't understand what you're up to! I know you think I'm crazy, but I saw what I saw! Jake, why don't you just throw this stuff away? Because I'm not willing to tolerate this any longer. All of this is nothing more than a bunch of fantasies going on only in your head. Jake, would you mind telling us what this is all about? Wouldn't it be simpler just to get another mirror? Well, aren't you going to answer? I'll have no more of this craziness. Now, Willy, you get out to the barn, get some turpentine, and clean up every last one of those mirrors. And the next time I see that mirror, it had better be on the trash heap. Now, look, Lacey. What do you see? Nothing, right? Nothing but ordinary reflections. Answer me. Yes. Nothing. Nothing but ordinary reflections. You know, I remember that grandma said when you break a mirror, you free everything that it's seen. At least we had some action around here for a change. She seemed pretty normal at first. Just as long as they don't move into the house. I wonder what's wrong with her. Timmy, where are my barber scissors? I don't know. Where did you leave them? Well, you better not have used them. Can't you even answer the phone? I'm not expecting any calls. There you are. I know you're there, Timmy. But you're not gonna scare me. You're just wasting your time. Why don't you just stay there? I'll be back in a few hours. Or maybe I'll stay with Jeff. He's so handsome. Boogeyman! But after Jake put all the pieces of the mirror back together, you saw only natural reflections. Right? Yes. Well, Lacey, this is how I see it. You gave Willy the knife with which he killed your mother's lover. Now, you gave this knife to him to cut him free. Not for him to kill. That was his decision. And you have to realize that it is guilt that tears you up now. You feel so guilty that you take on the character of this "boogeyman" by speaking in his voice. But believe me, you didn't kill him and you didn't make your brother Kill him. And it's not your fault if your brother does not speak. That's his own reaction to what happened that night. And even your brother himself can't be condemned. And by destroying the mirror, you've exorcized the ghost once and for all. Willy? Oh, there you are. Willy, once you're done in the barn, why not make Uncle Ernest happy and get the rest of the mirrors cleaned? How'd that happen? Where did it come from? I've gotta pull myself together. Take care, Willy. And from now on, no more giving in to these fantasies. Promise me? I promise. You know, Lacey, each time I wake up from a dream, I first believe it was real. Just like you. But you've got to make yourself realize that what you've had is nothing more than a waking dream. Jake, you think I'm crazy, don't you? No, I don't think you're crazy at all. I just wish... Why don't you and Kevin go on down to the lake. Hey, Kevin. Guess what this is for. I don't know. Go get your hat and jacket. We're going fishing! I wouldn't worry about those mirrors. Ernest and Helen don't understand. Come on, Kevin, let's go! See you later, Willy. Willy, don't touch that. See? Now you cut yourself. What kind of fish are here, mom? Well, I know there's some white birch here. How big are they? Like a shark? Well, maybe not that big. But you'll find out when you catch one. Hey! Hey, Jenny, you brought him, you take care of him. Yeah. This is for you! Why don't you just throw that thing back in the water? Well, here's looking at you, sweetheart. Well, Jenny, there are several things that I've been meaning to discuss with you. Would you mind stepping into my office? Let's see what's in the drawing room. This place is a mess. Isn't it? Well... Just close your eyes. Don't you think the hot dogs are about done yet, dear? Yeah. Why don't you get the buns out of the basket. And while you're at it, get me another cold one. All right. Mommy, why don't I catch a fish? You gotta be patient. Just keep your eye on the line. And if you feel something, hold on tight. Come on, Andy, let's get out of here. This place is giving me the creeps. Oh, come on. It was just some stupid board. Hey, you know, my parents are at the club today. Yeah? And we could go over to my house and listen to some music. Why don't we do that? Come on, let's go. Okay. Hey, what's all the sudden rush? Take it easy! Well, I'm ready to leave. Come on, Caroline, let's go. Aw, come on, can't you leave us alone? Ahh! No! You fool! Why would you do that? Sorry! I didn't mean for you to roll in the water! I'll get you a towel. Here, why don't you take the box back to the car. I'm freezing! What's taking him so long? Looks like he's just sitting there waiting. Waiting for what? Andy? Mommy! Mommy! I caught a fish! I caught a fish! Come on, Peter, let's go. Oh, God, look at those two. Mm-hmm, we're gonna be here all night, you know. I've never seen a kiss this long. Let's go. Yeah, well, what about Jenny and Andy? Oh, what about them? They've got their own car. Bye guys! See ya, freak! Jake, would you mind setting the table for me? Sure, no problem. We're having stew tonight. Plates are on the counter. Got apple pie, too. Would you like to have some cheese with it? Yeah, sounds terrific, Helen. Jake, I hate to bring this up again, but you know, the least you can do is pick up the broken pieces. I mean, Kevin plays around here in his bare feet. I mean, he can get badly cut. Mom, I want to share the fish with daddy. Okay, but first, you go rinse it off! My God. Lacey, who did this? Jake, I don't know. The mirror. Lacey, you were right. I should have taken you more serious. From the beginning. He's here, Jake. I know he's here. Who? When I broke the mirror, I released him. And now he's gonna get us. This is impossible. Lacey, he's dead! Your brother killed him 20 years ago! This is unbelievable. Father Riley? This is Ernest Edwards. Sorry to bother you, but we need your help. Oh, God, please. Please, help me. Get him away from me. Is this my penance for that night? Then please, God. Give us the strength to survive. Don't you think you might have just cut yourself? No, doctor. There's a force in that mirror. And it created terror. And Lacey outside... Her shirt was ripped to shreds. And you know what, doctor? She believes it's him. Him? Who? The ghost of her mother's lover. Here's a similar incident. The New York Times report, December 8, 1975... Well, doctor, I think I should get back to the house. I think we'd better close up the barn. Well, Jake can tell you best, Father. We'll be right back. It all started the other night. Helen, before we go back. Yes? I just want to tell you. I don't understand what this is all about. It came from the house where Lacey... and Willy grew up as Kids. Father Riley, can I ask you a straight question? Do you yourself believe in evil? I mean, as a tangible force? And when you picked up the piece, it burned? Yeah. I mean, it had its own power. My God. Willy, stay here with Lacey and Kevin. Come on, Father, let's go. Father, you're bleeding. Yeah, hello. Sheriff Johnson, please. Lacey, what are you doing? I'm fixing supper, dear. Lacey, Ernest and Helen are dead! Oh, that makes dinner for four. Father Riley, you're staying, aren't you? Would you be a doll and fix me a drink? Lacey? Get away! Get away! Get away! Get away! Get away! Lacey! The well! Kevin! Kevin! You didn't kill Ernest and Helen. It was him. You've got to stop suffering, Lacey. I'll never forgive myself. Wait for me! Kevin, honey! Come on! Let's go home! We've got to go back to the farm. There's a lot to do before the movers come. Right, Kevin? Are we gonna take a long ride? Mm-hmm. Mommy and daddy, and you and Willy, will be on the road for three days. Yay! Come on, Kevin. Let's go. One more day and we'll be away from it all. One more day doesn't seem so long after 20 years.
