- Yeah, I'm almost getting to the rental car now. I know. I didn't want to have this meeting, not on Christmas Eve. I mean, I didn't want to have the meeting at all, but I didn't have any choices. No one else could make this meeting. Yeah, I, I know. I know. Yes. I will be home for Christmas service. I promise. Okay, all right, I, I love you too. Okay, bye. - Paul, where you at? Call me. Hey, when you get here, come to the back door. I'll have the back door open for ya. - Learn how to drive, man. Come on. Come on. - Paul, are you outside? - Hey, Morgan, no. I'm caught up in some pretty bad traffic right now. I'm going to try to find a way around this somehow. I should be there in probably, I don't know, a few minutes. - Okay, Paul, I'm waiting for ya. I'll see ya when you get here. - All right, thanks, Morgan. - Okay. - Come on out. A little bit of help. Come on! What are you doing, man? Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey, would you move your cart? Look, pal, I got a job, man. I got places to go. I got to get going. Could you just move your cart? Move your junk outta here. What are you doing? Man, come on! What are you doing, man, can you just move? I'm in a hurry. All right, I've got a job I've gotta go to. I need you to move your cart of junk, man. - Maybe if you get up a little earlier, you wouldn't be in such a hurry. - Unbelievable, man. Look, maybe if you, you had a job. No, no, no, if you had, maybe if you took a shower, got an interview, then got a job, right, then maybe you might have a job to go to too. But I do, and if I don't get you to move outta here, I'm not going to have a job to go to. I am not going to have a job to go to. - This is all I have. - Look, let me, let me help you move your cart. - No, don't worry about it, I'll get it. I'll get it, I'll get it. - Thank you. - Hey, about time. - I know, I was, anyway, I'm here now. So you wanna show me those changes? - Well, I wanted you to meet me here in person so I can let you know. The budget's being cut on his project. And well, I'm going to ask you to cut your rate. - What? Morgan, I've been on this project since the very beginning. So you brought me here and there aren't any, any changes? - Listen, I know exactly what you're thinking. You're still going to be the lead on this project, but we just can't afford to pay you the regular rate. I'll tell ya what, I'll make it up to you on the next project. I promise. - Show me the changes. - There's a lot of changes. Come on, I'll show ya. Yeah, it's me. How ya doing? Yeah, I got him to come in Christmas Eve. No problem, he agreed to everything. Yeah, good. Yeah, I talked to him. He'll agree to anything. Yeah. Yeah, really good, yeah. This building needs so much work, we're gonna make a ton of money on this. Yeah, Paul's gonna help us, you bet. I got him. Yeah, we're gonna make a lot of money on this deal. Yeah. Yeah, it'll all work. It'll all work. Yeah, it sounds great. He didn't even have any question. Yeah, he agreed to everything. Okay, merry Christmas to you too. Bye. - Thank you. You, too. - Hello, this is Paul. - Hello? This is Marie with Western Airlines. Is this Mr. Hanson speaking? - Yes, it is. How can I help you? - Hello, sir. Unfortunately, the airline has had to cancel flight 632, your scheduled flight, due to unforeseen circumstances. The airline would like to offer you a complimentary stay at an area hotel for the inconvenience. - Yeah, is there, is there another flight maybe you can put me on? Can you put me on a different airline? It's Christmas Eve and I'm trying to get home for my family. - I am sorry, sir. However, due to the Christmas holiday, there are currently no more available flights at this time. The next scheduled flight is tomorrow morning at 6:00 a.m. We do apologize for the inconvenience. - I just, I can't, I can't believe this. Is there, is there any other alternative? Anything else that can be done? - No, sir. I'm so sorry. There really isn't. - This is unbelievable. Yeah, it's just. Yeah, it's Christmas Eve. I'm trying to get home to see my family. - I understand. If you would like to wait here at the airport, we can put you on standby in the event a seat opens up. It is possible that someone cancels, however, there is no guarantee. - Yeah. Okay, I understand. - One more thing, sir. The airline has sent you a text message concerning the free hotel stay. In it, you will find all the needed information in order for you to take advantage of the free stay if you choose to do so. - Yeah. Okay. - Once again, on behalf of the airlines, we do apologize. Merry Christmas, sir. - Yeah, you too. All right, thank you. - Hey! - Hey, it's me. I just got some bad news. Looks like my flight's been canceled. - No! Paul, we have the Christmas Extravaganza tonight. What are you gonna do? - I know. They've offered me a room. - Okay. - I'm not gonna take it. I called the rental car company and they're gonna let me drop the car off in Albuquerque so I can be home. I think I can make it. - The kids are gonna be so disappointed if you miss their part in the Christmas play. - I know. It's getting, it's gonna get dark here pretty soon. So, I'm just going to stop and get some gas and get fueled up and I'll get some coffee. I should be able to make it there on time. - Okay. Be safe driving. Okay, love you. - Love you, too. - Lord, get him home safe. - Dad's not going to be home for Christmas, Mom? - No, he might be a little late, but he'll be here. - I can't believe this. God, why are you always against me? Can't You see to it just once? Just once. To be on my side. Morgan wants me to do this job for half my pay. My flight. My family's waiting on me. I'm hours away from home on Christmas Eve. My family's expecting me home. I just don't get it. Can You just for once be on my side? Hey, excuse me. Hey. Do you have any creamer? - It's time to clean up your mess and get ready. We need you to go get dressed because we have a Christmas Extravaganza tonight, okay? - Okay. - I guess we're all out. - You're all out of cream? Do you have milk or something? - No, we don't have any milk. I'm sorry. - Yeah, thanks, I guess. - Sorry. - Agh! - Are these topiaries? - They are. - They were donated by the- - Hey, do you have any coffee that's not two days old? I mean, first there's no creamer, now the coffee tastes like it's two days old. - I will make a fresh pot. - Thank you, appreciate that. - That coffee will be ready in just one minute, sir. So anyway, these topiaries, they were donated by the ladies from the church. - Okay. - They made them, and aren't they beautiful? - Yes, they are. - I love what they did. They're ooh. - They're four-leaf clovers. - No, I think it's beautiful. Not gourmet. It's not gourmet coffee, but it's the best I can do here, so it's fresh. - I don't think it's gonna matter. - Hopefully it'll help. Next year the ladies were talking about making wreaths instead of the topiaries. I like wreaths. I think they're fancy. I mean, they look like Christmas, but these topiaries are just. - Yes, they are. - I mean, they're unique. So, but yeah, this was one of the test wreaths that Gloria made for us. She wanted us to see, you know. - Is it real? - I don't think it's real. I don't know, maybe, it's hard to tell with pine needles. Yeah, it doesn't really smell like a wreath, so. - Right. - But they're still pretty. I mean, they look just like Christmas. - They're festive. - I love it. They're so fancy and glittery. - Yeah, real fancy and glittery. - Well, like to stay here and talk to you the rest of the night, but I can't, but there's somebody else in bigger hurry than me, so I enjoyed it. You have yourself a very merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you too. - And a New Year's Eve to you. Thank you. - Yeah, ho, ho, ho. - You're next. - Excuse me for just a minute, please. - Are you serious? - I'll be right back. So sad, on Christmas Eve. - I'd rather die than beg for money or help somebody who is. - Just a coffee? - Yeah, just a coffee. - Here's your change. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah. Great. That's just what I need, a storm. - I'm gonna get the best Christmas present this year. - No, I am. - No, I am. - I'm getting the best Christmas present this year. - No, I am! - I am! - I'm getting a bike. - I'm getting a motorcycle. - Aren't you too young for a motorcycle? - C'mon, boys, I wanna read something to you. Are you guys excited about Christmas and presents? - Yeah! - Okay, well, I'm going to read something to you guys in the Bible and it's the Christmas story, okay? - Okay. - All right, so in Luke 1:26 says, "In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee, to a Virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David. Gabriel appeared to her and said, 'Greetings favored woman. The Lord is with you.' Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean. 'Don't be afraid, Mary,' the angel told her, 'For you have been found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus. He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David and he will reign over Israel forever. His kingdom will never end.'" - You ever had my best interest in mind? You ever just been on my side, just once? Why are You always against me? You just wanna see things go my way? - I always have your best interest in mind. I'm always on your side, son. Who is it that would be with you like I am? I just want you to listen to Me. You were never meant to do it on your own. To make it your way in this world, I am your provider. Of course, you do work. But what you work at daily should be what I'm leading you to do, and not your career path. - How could you allow Morgan to cheat me out of money like this? I have to take care of my family. I have to pay my bills. Got the kids' school tuition. The mortgage I'm never gonna pay off at this point. I'm doing everything right! Doing everything right! And this is how you repay me. - I never told you to work for Morgan. As a matter of fact, that company, they're just using you. Does that seem like somewhere where I'd want you to work at? But you don't listen to Me when I'm trying to lead you. Like today, when that homeless man stopped you in your tracks. Now, there's someone who really didn't listen to Me. - Christmas Eve, it's one of the loneliest nights for a lot of people around the world. You know that woman that you passed on your way into the store? Her and her kids are very much in that category this year. Your problems bother you, but her problems have put her in a really bad place this Christmas Eve - Jesus, please help him to get home safe. Help Paul drive safely to get here in time. I don't know why I'm so nervous tonight. Just... - Hey. - Hey, how are you? - Everything okay? - Oh, it's going good. I think the cat may have eaten some of the icicles. - Say what? - Icicles, you know the stringy things that you put on the tree? They're tin foily - Okay, is she okay? - I think she'll be all right. The next trip to the kitty litter might be kind of interesting. - Okay, so is that why you called? - Oh, no. I was just praying for you to have a safe trip home and it came to my heart that I really appreciate you driving home to be with us tonight. I know you could've stayed the night, and so it just means a lot to me. - I'm just glad that it's a late night service. Hopefully I can make it on time. - Okay. Drive safe. I love you. - I love you, too. I'll call you in a couple of hours. Bye. Agh! Agh! When are you going to be on my side? Now a train. Just can't catch a break, no matter what I do. Try to do all the right things, try to make everybody happy, try to do all the right things, go to the meetings when no one else wants to and this is what I get. Are you listening? Are you out there? Obviously you put a train in my way. You must want to say something to me, some reason you don't want me to get home for Christmas, be with my wife and kids. Trying to celebrate the birth of Jesus. Think You'd want that. - This is all about the birth of Jesus. This is exciting part. After seeing Him, the shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child. All who heard the shepherd's story were astonished, but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often. The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen. This was just as the angel had told them. Eight days later, when the baby was circumcised, He was named, - Jesus. - Jesus, the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived. So see, this was the real reason for Christmas. Jesus was born a baby so that we could have a relationship with God. - She really does appreciate you. And your kids, oh, they can't wait to see you. You're the hero in a lot of ways, you know. I really appreciate people who work hard keeping their families strong. Of course there's no strength like Mine when it comes to keeping relationships together. And that's what this is all about, you know? Life. I've put it altogether so that you could have relationships with each other. By doing this, you learn what relationships are, and then I'm able to introduce Myself to you. You, meaning everyone, of course. Sometimes when you're going through hard times, and sometimes not, it just depends on when the time is right. For as many people that say they want to have relationship with Me, I sure do get a lot of rejection though. I'm the most rejected person on earth. But I'm also the most famous person. There's no one like Me in the earth. So having a relationship with Me can be pretty complicated. At least that's how some people see it. It's pretty simple, actually. But being invisible makes it pretty hard for some people to believe. I did that on purpose. People have to take me at My word to get to know Me. But for those who don't want to hear Me speak to their hearts, I wrote a book. It's a best seller. Actually, it's the most popular book of all time. That's the truth. Get it? And for those who won't get to read it, I went a step further and I wrote a version on everyone's heart. How's that for technology, Silicon Valley? Hey, before we get too much further, I want you to do something for Me. I want you to go back to that gas station. Trust me. It'll be good. - I don't wanna go back. Now I'm really gonna be late. Excuse me. Is it okay if I sit here with you for a moment? - Sure. - Who is it, Mama? - I don't know, sweetheart. - Earlier I saw you out here and I feel really bad for your situation and I, I didn't say anything, I just walked on by. Is there anything I can do for you or your children? - I don't have any money. I have my car. I had just enough money to get here. It's Christmas Eve. I just want something for my children. - I don't have much. I'm here on a business trip, so I don't have a lot of cash on me, but what I have is yours. What I do have, you can take it. I don't know where this came from. This had to have come from the Lord. - Look, Mom, this man's loaded. - I don't, I don't know what to say, this. Just take it. - I don't know what to say. - You should thank the Lord. This is definitely, this isn't from me. Thank the Lord 'cause this, I don't have this kind of money. - Thank You, Lord. - Thank You, Lord. - Thank You, Lord. Thank You. Thank you. - I'm sure you have to get going. I've got to get on the road too. Have a very Merry Christmas and God bless you. Here, here take the money in here, I just don't want people seeing you with all this money around, okay? - Where we going, Mommy? - Christmas shopping. We're going Christmas shopping. Christmas shopping, we're going Christmas shopping! You can get whatever you want. Thank You, Lord, thank You. Thank You, Lord. - God bless you, have a Merry Christmas. - Thank you, thank you. Thank You, Lord. - We're about to close, it's Christmas Eve. More coffee? - No. No, I was in here earlier and I was just really caught up in my own problems and I was a little rude. Okay, I was rude. And I'm really sorry about that. - Wow, thanks. Thanks for that. - I'm supposed to tell you that your situation, it's gonna be okay. Medicine is not an answer all by itself. It's not the only answer. It's okay that you're taking medicine. It's not the answer all alone, but it's okay that you're taking it. I'm just supposed to tell you that it's gonna be okay. I just needed to let you know that. - Thank you for that. I've been praying about it. I gave God until, I gave God until today and then I was gonna take my. Anyway, thank you and I believe you. - It's gonna be okay. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. - Wow. Thank You, God. - Sure could use a ride. - Hey, man, it's you from the alley. - Can I get a ride? - Yeah, come on in, should be unlocked. This has been a weird day. Man, it's been an unusual day and I, I'm sorry about earlier. - Mm-hmm. - So where can I take you? - Take me, take me to the church. - Okay. What, where, where was the church at? Can you give me a little more direction? - Just keep going straight down here. There'll be a four-way stop. And then we'll take a left once we get there. - Okay. - That's the way I remember getting there. - They have, they've got people there that can feed you and take care of you. - Most of the time they do. But there's sometimes people aren't there and the lights are off. It seems like no one's around, but there's been times where I knocked on their door and the pastor opened the door for me and he had a meal, he had a hot meal for me. And that's why you sometimes can't just think that they're not there because you don't think they're there, you have to knock sometimes and doors will open. Right here, right here, right here. Get in the left-hand lane right here. Right here. - Okay, right here go left. - Yeah, we're gonna take this left right here. - Right here go left. - Right here, go left. Well, you know, sometimes you have to look at it different ways. It could be tough to manage a household, to manage family, but you have to look at it in a way where you, thank God, you got that to manage. You can have my situation and I don't even know where my shopping cart is or all my stuff, but it's out there somewhere and I gotta trust God that it'll be there when I get back. But to have your problems. - No, I know it. It feels, I mean I feel just terrible even saying it, but there've been times I've just said, you know, what have these homeless people got, like, you know, they don't have any- - You mean like me? - Like you. - Like me. - Like you. You know, I think, you know, maybe they have it easier than I do because you don't have anything to worry about. - Regardless of our financial situations or living arrangements, we all have the same problem and we all have the same needs. And without God, we can't do anything. - But how, how can you keep going, day after day when you just don't have answers and you, you go, "God, why have You left me here on the streets?" Do you feel like He's forsaken you? - I wouldn't say that. Just because I don't have the things that everybody else has or I don't have a home or, you know, I don't have a big flat screen TV in my house, I eat, I breathe, and I know every day God's watching me. He's watching out for me, you know, and regardless of what anybody says about me, how I smell and how I act, I just know that He's there to protect me. Watch out right here, get in the right-hand lane. You gotta come over a little bit. - I'm looking for traffic first, you're good. - All right, we're getting real close to the church up here. We're getting close to it. Up here you're gonna take a right. - Okay. - Just watch out for it here on the side. Just go ahead and pull up. Just pull up over here and we should be good. Somebody should be in there. - Let me help you get up on here. - Thank you. - They feed you from time to time. - Every once in a while when they got something hot or something they don't want. - Well, let's see if there's somebody here to help you. - I hope so, it's been a while. - I'm not so sure someone's here. - Hey, hello. How may I help you? - Merry Christmas, Pastor. - Merry Christmas to you, sir. - I'm from out of town. This gentlemen needs help, but I gotta get back on the road. Would you be able to help him? - Oh yes we can. We're glad to help him. This is a time that we help people. Sure we can, yes, sir. What's your name, sir? - My friends call me John. - John, that's a good name. Come on in the house, John. - Thank you for all you did for me as well. - Mister, you too. - Nice to meet you, Merry Christmas to you, and be safe on the road. God bless you as you travel. - Thank you. - Come on in, John. - Okay, so now I've done what You've wanted me to do, but now I can't keep the promise to my wife, or to my kids. I don't understand. So You want me to keep Your word, but I can't keep my word to my wife and my kids. Doesn't make any sense to me. Hello? - Hello? Can I speak to Mr. Hansen? - You are. - Hello, sir. This is Marie again with Western Airlines. I have some good news. We have a flight for you. - Excuse me? - The airline has opened up a few new flights due to this being the peak holiday travel season. - Yeah, go ahead. - One of which is a direct flight to your original destination. - Oh, that's great, fantastic news. - However, in order to get you a seat, you will need to be at the airport in 20 minutes. - You gotta be kidding? 20 minutes? - Yes, sir, 20 minutes. - Okay, I'm on my way, thanks. - Please go to terminal three, gate five. Your flight number is 821. Be sure to show your ticket from the canceled flight to the attendant. - Thank you, ma'am. - Merry Christmas, sir. - Merry Christmas to you, too. Thank you, Jesus. Yeah, going home. - Boys, it's time to get ready. Boys! Hey guys, look what I found. So I found some more decorations. So how about while we wait for your dad to get here, we put a few more on the tree, okay? - Uh-huh. - Okay. There you go. Okay, find a good spot. Look for any empty place. - Yeah, I think some in the back. - You're such good helpers. You want this one? Be very careful with this one. Yeah, you can do it. Why don't you put it right here? It's almost time for the Christmas Extravaganza. You guys excited? - Yeah! - Yeah.
