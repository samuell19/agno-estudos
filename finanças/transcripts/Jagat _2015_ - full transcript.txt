NORTHERN MALAYSIA A FEW MONTHS EARLIER Appoy! Keep this card somewhere safe. - Hot water is ready for you. - Okay. - We're almost out of sugar. - Okay. Hey, get over here. - How many times have I told you? - Dad! - Why won't you listen to me? - Dad! - You never learn, do you? - Dad! - Will you do it again? - No, Dad. Sit. Why did you get an F? The teacher told us to write an essay entitled, "I am a Pen." So, I wrote about a pen that can fly. A flying pen? The pen flies in my story. You idiot! The teacher wanted us to use our imagination. Write an essay worthy of an A. - Do it now. - But the essay has already been graded. There's no point in rewriting it now. You dare talk back? You'll do as I say! Go! Look at that hair. It's like a bird's nest that was messed up by monkeys! Every object has a pattern. Those curtains over there have patterns on them. Even the saris and sarongs that your mothers wear have patterns on them. You're going to dip vegetables in paint and create art with patterns. That looks really good. Please make me one. I saw something on TV yesterday. In Japan, they rear a special breed of cattle in a place called Kobe. They have it drink beer for breakfast. Even if it walks just a short distance, they give it a leg massage to make sure the meat stays tender. What a life, right? But you're okay with being slaughtered after that? Hell yes! You drink beer first thing in the morning and get massages on-demand. What more could you ask for? Pay the bill and let's get going. Hey, the money is on the table. Greetings, dude. Suguna, who are you coming as? How about you, Murali? Kumar? And you, Shankar? He thinks out of the box. Michael Jackson is a fine idea, but how will you do the costume? Hey! Hey! Hey! You're calling me like that? Like that? - I have a name! - Calm down. - I'm sorry. - Relax. We're all friends here, aren't we? Appoy, fetch me the matches from that drawer. Uncle, is this you? Yes. Is this Dad? Yes. That was when your dad acted in a play at the estate. Dad was actually smiling. Uncle, why do you live in this place? Look at that, Appoy. The sea. There's a hill behind us. Properties with such views can cost millions. While we can get it for free from nature, many of us choose to live in debt instead. All could you ever want is around you, Appoy. All you need to do is keep your eyes open. I'm Da Gou. Your friend was really pissed off today, right? Let's drink! Drink up! Look at my watch. Can you guess how much it costs? I don't know, 1,000 ringgit? How about you? I'm sure it costs 3,000 ringgit. 3,000 ringgit? It only cost me 50 ringgit. Just because I own a fancy car... Even if I wear a fake, everyone thinks it's authentic. You two ride bikes. Even if you wore authentic watches, no one would believe that they are. That's just the way of the world, my friend. Okay? You want people to respect you, but respect is earned, not given. You didn't sleep last night, did you? I had a headache. - Mangai! - Yes? Sir, didn't you like my painting? I liked it a lot. Then why did you give me a C, sir? The objective was to make patterns with the vegetables. But aren't these patterns? - What did you hear? - A clink. I told you to paint the spoon and the glass. But you've painted the sound instead. You're a good artist, but... You'll get what I mean someday. You just want a good grade, don't you? The Primary School Achievement Test is next year. There will be no more art classes. You won't have time for them either. Sir, I got less pay. That can't be right. Count it properly. I've already counted it, boss. It's still short. But you took an advance this month. No, I didn't. Look here. It says, "Maniam." That means you've taken an advance. But I certainly did not. All right. Bring your account card tomorrow. We'll sort this out. 128 RESTAURANT Sir, is that your car out there? Why? You haven't paid for it in 34 months. We're here to repossess your car. We're just trying to make a living. Appoy, remember the account card I gave you the other day? Go get it. Why are you still here? - Go get my account card. - Account card? - The account card! - It's upstairs! Have you found it yet? Choose between the two. What's up with this guy? He's bold enough to openly put a gun on the car and walk away. I think we should forget about it and leave. Dorai! What the hell is taking you so long? What's all this? You're going to grow up and monkey around, too? - Are you? - No, Dad! Please don't, Dad! Dad! Please don't, Dad! Dad! Please don't, Dad! What the hell was that? Have you gone mad? You're reckless, aren't you? Open it up. - My name is Gila. - Dorai. You're amazing. - Takkali. - Dorai. - Takkali. - I'm Potato. Just kidding. Please drink. You've introduced yourselves, right? Come. Let's drink. Cheers! Da Gou, you and I have a problem. You've sent these punks to repossess my car instead of dealing with me directly. You've humiliated me. Now, I have a bone to pick with this Indian. Get over here if you've got a problem with me. We'll settle this. One-on-one. Come on! I don't believe in gang fights. We'll settle this like gentlemen. If you win, you tell your guys to beat the shit out of me. If I win, you get the fuck out of here! Come on, dickhead! 7 times 6 is 42. 8 times 6 is 48. 9 times 6 is 54. 10 times 6 is 60. -11 times 6 is 66. - Fine, sit down. Shankar. Recite the 9th multiplication table. 1 times 9 is 9. 2 times 9 is 18. 3 times 9 is... Haven't you memorized it yet? I remembered it until yesterday, sir. But I seem to have forgotten it today. The multiplication table will help you greatly, not only in exams, but also in life. Then what do we have calculators for, sir? - What did you say? - Nothing. Calculators? You want to use a calculator instead of your brain. You will memorize the tables on your knees. Go! Maniam, wait. I made a mistake the other day. Here's the rest of your salary. - Please don't be mad. - Okay. - Thank you. - Okay. Thank you. So, he's given you your remaining salary, Maniam? It's my hard-earned money. Where else would it go? Aren't we going out to celebrate? Aren't you drinking, Maniam? I stopped drinking years ago. When we lived in the rubber estates, all we got was a movie once a month and a stage play once a year. If we danced to the tune of their whips, we wouldn't go hungry. In the towns these days, beer has replaced toddy. That means we're still slaves, but to a different master. What's this, Maniam? You're preaching while sober. Our parents braved the jungles and formed this country. Now, all that's left of them are their graves. They sold the estates, and left us high and dry. We'll need money if we want to break this cycle of slavery. But we don't have money. So, the only way forward is through education. My brothers never understood it. If my son won't understand it either... Come on. Let's drink. What's that? Where have you been? Get on the bike! You're loitering, aren't you? You're loitering when you should be studying. Mr. Ratnam has passed away. His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. - What's up, guys? - What is it, Ennaman? Mr. Ratnam passed away. His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. Go straight home. Tell your mother I'll be late. Mr. Ratnam passed away. His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. The Primary School Achievement Test is only four months away. But, even now, some of you still haven't memorized the 12th multiplication table. Stand up! Recite the 12th multiplication table. 1 times 12 is 12. 2 times 12 is 24. 3 times 12 is 36. 4 times 12 is 48. 5 times 12 is 60. 6 times 12 is 72. 8 times 12 is 84. 9 times 12 is 108. 10 times 12 is 120. 11 times 12 is 132. 12 times 12 is 144. Half for Mom, half for Dad. Stand up! Share what you've written with the rest of the class. Read it out loud. "Little egg. I am the big egg. Half for Mom, half for Dad. 6 times 6 is... Here comes the teddy bear." Keep this up, and you'll get a zero on your tests. Uncle, why do we have to go to school? Can't we learn things from TV? Why do we have to do things we don't like? If you don't like it, don't do it. Even memorizing the multiplication tables? Don't do it, then. If I don't memorize them in two weeks, Dad will be called to the school. Here. That's a magic mirror. It gauges if a person is intelligent or dumb. Memorize the tables while looking into this mirror. You will become intelligent when you can no longer see your mouth moving in this mirror. 1 times 12 is 12. 2 times 12 is 24. 3 times 12 is 36. 4 times 12 is 48. 5 times 12 is... Hey. Do you always wear a leather jacket? Come rain or shine? I've always wanted to ask you this, man. Did you shave your head to be stylish? Or did you shave your head because you're balding? For style, right? Hey, show some respect when you speak to him. He's insane. - Insane? - Yes. What has he done that was so insane? We were driving around with our friends one night. There was a police checkpoint up ahead. This guy doesn't have a driver's license, and he hasn't paid the road tax. Well? What happened? As the police were ready to issue us a summons, he grabbed the summons booklet, jumped across a drain, and ran off. Wow, you're spectacular! Let's drink to you, for making it across that drain. Come on. If Bala wasn't around back then, I would be long dead. I would've been cut by a machete. He's just like you. He's a man of action. He doesn't waste time by thinking. Am I right? Act first. Think later. Enough of that, Da Gou. That was a lifetime ago. Let's eat! Aren't you going to ask them to join us? That's all right. They're having a good time drinking. Let's eat. A drink? Do you think it's wrong? I joined the triad on a whim. But now, I play the game in earnest. All know the way, but few actually walk it. Do you think you're such a badass because you want to join our gang? Prove it. I dare you to throw the beer in his face. - You dare throw it in my face? - I dare you! - You dare throw it in my face? - Throw it in his face! - You dare throw it in my face? - Throw it in his face if you dare! - You dare throw it in my face? - Fucking do it already! Have all of you memorized the multiplication tables? Shankar. Let's hear it. What? You don't know it by heart yet? 1 times 12 is 12. 2 times 12 is 24. 3 times 12 is 36. 4 times 12 is 48. 5 times 12 is 60. 6 times 12 is 72. 7 times 12 is 84. 8 times 12 is 96. 9 times 12 is 108. 10 times 12 is 120. 11 times 12 is 132. 12 times 12 is 144. Sir, may I ask you a question? Sir, what is 17 times 8? It's 112. What is 19 times 12? It's 228. Don't you know the multiplication tables? Knowing the multiplication tables up to 12 is enough. We have calculators for anything past it. Isn't that what I said the other day, sir? I am your teacher. You have to listen to me. Then how come you get to beat us when we get it wrong? Mother, Father, Teacher? - God! - God! Mother, Father, Teacher? - God! - God! Mother, Father, Teacher? - God! - God! NA TUK KONG ALTAR Ennaman! Mr. Ramu has passed away. His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. The village head asked me to inform you. Make sure you're there. Sir, Mr. Ramu has passed away. His funeral is at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. All right. Rocho, this is my big brother. Fine. Why don't you go there? So, it's like that? Dorai. I love you, Dorai. All right. Now go over there. Go now. They call me Vadi. I know exactly who you are, Vadivelan. Dorai. Hey, call him Mexico. Mexico. - Dorai. - Rocho, sit down. So, I hear you're a hunter too. Or so my boys tell me. How can a small fry like you ever hope to play in the big leagues? Don't you get it? Drugs. Drugs are the future. I'm not in the business of selling drugs. I'm in the business of turning people into pieces. That's nice. Don't ever come here again, Vadivelan. Sir, how are you? Yes, just the same. Alive and kicking. It was said they buried him alive. This was Appoy's doing. He gave Appoy some homework. Isn't it common to beat a child who hasn't done his homework? Would you announce a man's death for that? He's just a young boy anyway. Please don't punish him too harshly. I don't know what Appoy has against me. He said that I told him to announce Mr. Ramu's death. I'm not too bothered by this mess. But Mr. Ramu is quite distraught. We may be in the 21st century, but aren't teachers supposed to be respected like gods? Appoy! Appoy! Appoy! - Kumar, we don't have school next week. - How come? Prayers for Mr. Ramu! Here's to Mr. Ramu's death! But I don't smoke. Appoy! I just held the cigarette, Dad. I didn't smoke it. I didn't do it, Dad. I held it, but I didn't smoke it. I really didn't. I didn't, Dad. I held it, but I didn't smoke it. Show some pity. If anyone dares to untie him... Eat up. Your dad once accused me of skipping school. So, he tied me to a tree. There was an ant hill nearby. He got a part of it and threw it at me. I was bitten all over. You know how your dad is like, don't you? But I didn't do anything wrong, Uncle. Hey, fatty. Looks like someone got a proper beating yesterday. Are you staring at me? Hey, are you staring at me? Hey, I'm talking to you. Don't you dare ignore me. Leave my head alone! Hey! Be careful. Otherwise, no one will help you. Why don't you hit him now? Go ahead. What's going on? Settling a dispute between these kids. These kids had an argument, so I came here to settle it. What's up, Appoy? You know who he is, don't you? He's Mexico's nephew. Get lost. Let's go, Panther. - Hey. - Go. Two orders of iced chocolate malt. Check out the informant over there. Tell that Bangladeshi in the green T-shirt to come here. If he refuses, tell him I'll come to him. You, Bangla! Get over here. What is it? Not you. I was talking to the guy in green. What is it, little brother? "Little brother"? Am I your brother? Get over here. Why? What is this about? If he doesn't come with me, Chicago will come here instead. Come here. Where were you running off to? - Are you Shah Rukh Khan? - No. - Salman Khan? - No. My name is Mirzan. - What did you say? - Mirzan. Brazen, isn't he? Speak only when I ask you to. Don't speak out of turn. Are there plenty of girls in this town? Answer me. - What's going on here? - Just a bit of fun. - What are you doing here? - Ask Chicago. Appoy is awesome, Mexico. You should have seen how he intimidated this Bangla guy. The guy was scared stiff. How many times do I have to repeat myself? Quit horsing around. Do you know what this Bangla guy has been doing? He's been wooing our local girls. Hey, get lost! Go home. So you're a big man now? - What happened, dear? - Ask him! - You're a big man now? - What? Appoy! How dare you raise your hand against your dad? Don't you ever do that again. Go to your room! Mexico shouldn't have chastised us in front of those runts. He treats Rocho better than us. That slap wasn't meant for me. It was meant for you. Are you here to stir shit up between me and Mexico? Don't pull your tricks on me, you dog! I'll break your face! Get lost! Do you know why they say, "Cheers"? The eyes see it. The hand feels it. The nose smells it. The tongue tastes it. But pity the ears because they're left out. And so they say... Drink up. I'm reminded of my dad every time I look at you. He was pretty much like you, a loyal thug. All that will last for as long as you're young. They say education is the key. But the educated answer to those in power. There is no room for intelligence in this world. Only power. Now, if you were in power, the educated would answer to you. She's an unblemished rose. Handle her with care. Sir, it's done. Want to try it, sir? Mom? Mom? Mom? Boss, heroin is in high demand. Boss, we're low on stock. What do we do? Grind this up and mix it in. I've heard the news, Mexico. You started out as a thug, and now you've moved to drugs. Drugs? Me? You know I despise those things, sir. Don't bother denying it. Just make sure you don't get caught. Come in, Appoy. - I'll come back another day. - Appoy! Come. Sit here. Once upon a time, you had an uncle. He was very fit. Then, he got hooked on this drug and eventually became your late uncle. You must never forget that. You must never ever touch this stuff. Each man leads his life according to his own sense of justice. But above all that, there is a higher truth. In the presence of that higher truth, when we stand before it, we are all... hollow. In its presence, when we stand before that higher truth, we are all hollow. Maniam! Maniam! Your brother, Bala, was found dead. Vadivelan! You've done it this time. - Talk to me! - You're dead meat! You have to deal with me first. I'm the one you're looking for. You're dead now. No. You're dead. This was all Chicago's doing. Mexico knew nothing about it. Thank you. If that guy dies, Mexico may be imprisoned. But don't worry. If Mexico is imprisoned, I'll give you 1,000 ringgit every month. There's no need for that. Thanks anyway, sir. He's one of my boys, after all. I have to look out for him. He's my brother. Yes? All right. It's a good thing that guy didn't die. PENGKALAN HULU MAGISTRATES COURT - Appoy's uncle is a pussy! - How come? He cried like a baby at the police station. That's exactly how he cried. - My uncle didn't cry. - Yes, he did. He's a pussy! Close your eyes, Dorai. Leave your troubles in the past. Eat well, Dorai. Eat. - Mom, is Uncle back home? - He's in the room. Have you eaten, Appoy? I've made up my mind, Da Gou. Shall we execute Chicago? I want to quit the gang. I still want out. Look at these brothers of yours. Who will look after your brothers if you quit? Regardless of who wants to leave, the rules still apply. We have mixed our blood. So that blood has to be returned. Do you understand? Gila, you're always with him, aren't you? Hit him. Stop, boy. I said stop, didn't I? Why are you squaring your shoulders? Don't do that. Don't square your shoulders, boy. Rocho! That's enough!
