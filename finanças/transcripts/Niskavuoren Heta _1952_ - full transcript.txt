My dear friends... Marriage was ordained by God in the beginning... ...when He created an and woman... ...united them and blessed them. The apostle Paul teaches that the man is head of the woman... but the man must also love his wife... ...and respect her. Equally, must the woman love and respect her husband for woman is created for man... ...not man for woman Thus man and woman should love each other... ...and so shall their marriage be happy and blessed.... ...as we ask God's grace and blessing for this couple. Amen In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... ...and in the presence of this congregation... ...I ask you, Akusti Harjula... ...will you take Heta Niskavuoren... ...to be your lawful wife... ...and love her in weal and woe? Yes. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... ...and in the presence of this congregation... ...I ask you, Heta Niskavuoren ...will you take Akusti Harjula... ...to be your lawful husband... ...to love and respect him in weal and woe? Yes. Thus, as a servant of Christ... ...I pronounce you man and wife... ...in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... Amen Drink some cold water and you'll feel better. I don't need anything. Give me...! Goodness me! Maybe you should lie down for a bit. Or should I get the mistress, or Akusti? No! I don't want anyone. I don't need anything. Why did she rush off like that? Felt sick. I guessed as much. Was such a big wedding necessary? There are as many people here as at MY wedding. Well no, Kustaava's wedding was probably more beautiful. And Matti had a big farm... ...but poor Heta ends up with this. In her day, Heta had a suitor for every finger. Where did Heta get to? The dancing will be starting soon and Akusti is all worked up. What on earth are you doing here? I'm sorry. - So, where's Heta? - In the bedroom. Don't go in. She's not feeling well. "With flowers and veil." People probably guess it anyway. You can't do anything about Heta. I can't bear this sort of thing... Juhani bought them Muumaki yesterday. 400 acres... and did Heta even thank him? You know Heta... She seems to have cleared out this place. The linen sheets and the towels that grandma promised. Come on... even if she IS feeling poorly... Well now, Heta, how are you feeling? Why are you looking at me like that? I feel fine. It was just getting so hot. Don't get snappy with US. Everyone knows what's wrong with you... probably. Gustava! It's hardly very hard to guess Do you think I would have married a farmhand otherwise? Akusti! What are you talking about? I dare say Akusti is aware. Of course I know. Why else would Heta Niskavuori accept a farm-boy like me. But since you have accepted me... ...I'm going to look after you well. As well as a farm-boy can manage. After all, I'm the one who did well. So well, that you let me stand beside you. And don't forget it. No need to roll your eyes to heaven, on account of me. I think I can take care of myself. What are you doing here, Akusti? You should be in the ballroom. What would a farmhand do there, among the gentry? But you have your bride there. Heta may be something else, but she's still a Niskavuori. - I need to talk to you. - You've had your say. Heta, I can't help it, that I began to like Esther. I'm not interested in your infatuations. Mr Lammentausta. Akusti is a decent fellow, it's a pity to deceive him. What are you raving about? You obviously don't know me. No, I don't. Wouldn't it be best if you went back to your Esther? Can't we talk like sensible people? I'm carrying a farm-hand's child. Good Lord! So Heta's picking up stuff from here! Akusti had an empty chest, and worn-out boots, when he left us. But now he's a home-owner. People have talked about that chest. Heta claims that Akusti's inheritance is in it. There were just farm-hand things in it. He made the chest while he was here. Things are looking good. I'll never forget how good you and your husband have been to me. You can call us Lovisa and Juhani, now that you're part of the family. Even though I don't have a red cent in my pocket. Makes me not much of a man. Anything I have is from your generosity. Heta's legacy is everything. We've had the same fate. We both ended up serving the Niskavuori family. But one manages to muddle through, somehow. Then there's so much to do... ...like you have there at Muumaki. You see... I'd always wanted my own plot of land... though it needed to be more than a fistful of soil. I want to improve Muumaki so that Heta has no regrets. Like we try to improve ourselves... God help us. And lead us not into temptation. Is Muumaki a big house? Well it's over 400 acres... ...but I don't know about the buildings. Have you ever been there, Heta? No. Akusti didn't want to, until the rooms were in order. His mother is tidying up there. I know old Mari. Mari is the only thing that Akusti had, to put in the house. Akusti has savings in the bank. And he has rich relatives in Langelmaki Really? I never knew that! Heta means, as the saying goes, that they have ten horses, and use the eleventh to put the bread in the oven. A new barn needs to be built. But the main building is in good condition. The main building is only a crofter's cottage...- But I have two strong hands and a good wife... ...so we should manage. The buildings are a bit dilapidated at Muumaki. Well, you can't compare with Niskavuori... but they'll do for us. Life's supposed to get better, if you work hard. Come and dance! Let me put the pot down first! Give him time! And Niskavuori needn't be ashamed. Esther and Lammentausta make a lovely couple. That looks like a wedding for summer. He gets himself a rich wife with Esther Harness the horses, we're leaving right away. Where is Akusti? You're supposed to be leaving in the morning. The dancing's not half over! Well go and dance! Where is Akusti? In the staff room, last I saw. What are you doing here? It's not your place any longer. - We're leaving now. - Where are we going to? Where to? To Muum?ki, and right away. Well if that's the case, I guess we're going. Put the chest on our chaise, and you Mikko... ...keep your eye on the chest until we come. It has all our silver and Akusti's money in it. Some wedding guests were supposed to go with you... ...if you hadn't left so suddenly. Nobody need come, and no one is invited to Muum?ki... ...before the house is in order, as you well know. You'll be welcome any time, once the roof is fixed. All the best, Heta... ...and good luck with your new home. So the last daughter of this generation leaves Niskavuori. Thank you for everything, Sir. You don't need to "sir" Juhani any longer. You're now your own master. Is that so?! Old habits die hard. Goodbye, Lovisa. Goodbye. You can be happy now that you've finally got rid of me. Though I guess you filled Mum's place. Thank you. Goodbye, Ma'am. Goodbye, Reverend. May God bless you. I wish you a humble and grateful heart. Well, if everyone humbled themselves, God wouldn't need to do it. What do you mean by that?! You have always shown conceit before the Lord. I shall pray to God to give you a humble heart. Pray if you like. Praying for my heart may help, but it won't make me humble. No, wait! I nearly forgot the candlesticks. Grandma promised me them. But Juhani said they should stay in the house. I'm not leaving what's mine... anywhere. You could have got them later. What's yours is yours... but what's mine is mine. And what's mine, is also yours. There grew up... in her father's house... a girl so gentle and fair. Just like a rose... in the shadow's care... on the lovely meadow green Just like a rose in the shadow's care on the lovely meadow green Is this Muumaki? No, it's Taavetti's place. It's still a fair way to Muumaki. Is this Muumaki? That? That's Tiirman's. We've nearly reached Muumaki. There it is now... Muumaki. But look at the land, Heta... the fields and the trees. Goodness, Granny! Granny! They're coming now, and all the stuff's outside. Good gracious, are they here already? Akusti said they wouldn't be here till tomorrow. Everything is higgledy-piggledy and I can't do anything. I can manage. Hello. So this is it. A one-bedroom cottage. Not much room for joy here... ...but nor for sorrow either. We'll be able to manage here. Welcome to the young couple and good luck to you. Thank you, Roope. You must know Roope, Heta. He's Gammy's dad. This is Gammy. She's been here to help. Now, my girl, put the coffee on. Yes, Granny. Granny? Does she mean you, Mari? My mother is now a "granny" as she's the master's mother. You can thank my young wife for that. Of course I thank her. And you must thank Heta for your luck. Is this the bedroom? Yes. I wallpapered it myself. Bring Akusti's chest in here. What for? It can't fit in here. Just bring it in! Could Gammy stay here to help out... ...for when I'm too tired to do anything? I don't need any help. So "no" then. Well I'll go do the milking. Well, Gammy might as well come home. You needn't be so nasty to my mother. Sure, she's a bit slow... but in Gammy you could have a good maid. I can't afford maids. A new building comes first. Won't you be overexerting yourself? I'll look after you for as long and as best I can. So you should. Janne and Mikko are on the road. They're going back to Niskavuori. Let them go. This is Muumaki... ...and we'll build a new house by the lake. What's that house on the other side of the lake? That's Huovila. That's where Esther lives. Nobody from there or from Niskavuori... ...is invited here before the new house is ready. The dogs will be set on anyone who dares come here. Granny, granny! Mr Harjula, Mr Harjula! What are you doing milking, when you're so poorly. So long as Heta doesn't take it amiss. I'm not much good for anything now. I didn't realise you were in such poor health. Wouldn't it be best if I did the milking? Just the milking. Gammy is such a good girl. Let her stay here as help. So long as Heta doesn't take it amiss. I'm not good for anything, till the grave. We'd better get started, with a child on the way... though he'll be a farmhand's son. The farmhand you seduced. Seduced the seducer. You've had fun with your farmhand. Hands off! Now we'll be in our own bed. How come you're here so early, Ma'am? What's so early? You can't find time for the fields, if you're in bed all day. The new house will only happen with work. What's the matter with the house you have? I'm sure it's good enough for Mr Harjula. But not for a daughter of Niskavuori. What are you staring at? Can't we even afford a good hoe handle? Heta seems to be starting on everything here. She hardly takes a moment's rest. Akusti even less. Yes, he also fishes at day's end, to sell in the Tampere market. They're probably saving some money. We'll see how long the master can last. This roof needs new shingles. If this hovel falls apart, what then? It'll be fixed, and it'll be a good job. Our new house doesn't seem to be getting any closer. We'll still build a new house, if we find the time. I'll go and clean the barn. Get Gammy to go with you. No time for lazing around, here. Why so quiet now, Gammy? I was just looking at your face, Master. And the lines that only get deeper. What are you talking about? When you toil day and night... The mistress only talks about her own money. Well, she's right. I know how it must feel... ...for a daughter of the gentry to be toiling in a hovel in Muumaki. But everyone needs to toil in this world. We are born to toil, but the mam'selle from Niskavuori... ...was born to sit and crochet in the salon. Then she finished up with someone like me. I'm Gammy for I was born gammy. People have to learn to adjust to their circumstances. Look out! A rock! Poor Gammy! Look what's happened to you now! It wasn't bad... for someone like me. How can you say that? There are lot's of ways of being crippled. Some have a crippled foot, some a crippled soul. You're always so nice to me. What'll you do now? I guess I'll have to look after you. I'm very lucky. We have to get off home. - Yes, we do. - Heta will be expecting us. What are you doing mending the master's clothes, Gammy? There's plenty of work to be done. I didn't think the master had time to mend them himself, Ma'am... ...when he's all day in the field, and at night on the lake. You're always running after the master and attending to him. I'm the one you should be attending to. Since you're always in the field... No one is checking the nets, and he is in Tampere. You can go to the lake by yourself. This is where I thought it should be. It has to be imposing. It will be, so long as we have the time. And it's fun playing on the slope, for the kids... ...and there'll soon be more of them on the way. - The things you say! - I mean it! - Isn't Daddy home yet? - No, you go to bed. Why are the children awake so late? They get so excitable, expecting gifts from Tampere. Is that what you expect, too? What took you so long? I had so many things to do. Gammy feared you'd run into robbers. Gammy get's frightened by a daddy-long-legs. Also, Santeri Lammentausta is here till the rain stops. He won't be invited in. No one's invited until the new house is ready. We can't just leave someone out in the rain. I'll go and call him in. He can wait in the stable, but not in here. Gammy, fix something hot for us to eat. Yes, Master. Did daddy get me a pocket knife? Daddy's not here. Just go back to bed. Good... evening. Good evening. Come on, off you go. I want to wait for Daddy. Is that him? Yes, my son. Now get out! Just let me look at the boy. You heard him say "Daddy". I think you're drunk. Akusti invited me. I'm not drunk, though I've every excuse to be. Did you come to gawk at the Muumaki hovel? I just wanted a peep at the boy. Do you have no heart? I had a heart, but it froze up in your hands. It's OK now... the sauna's warm enough... but we need the new house. Listen, Heta, things are a bit crazy for me at the moment. Meaning what? Have you lost the money? Well not lost, but I've used it. Used? How? Without talking with me?! I thought that if we used that money to build a house or barn... ...there it would be, one, not more... so the money must multiply. What sort of insane talk is this? You see, Tuomas Huovila has tried to sell us his woodland... ...a good 500 acres... ...and since I had the money in the bank, I bought it. So all the money went on that crappy woodland? Next, I'll build the barn... ...and when the trees grow, we'll have the house. So until then... I'm stuck in the Muumaki hovel!? A bit more water on the stones. And in the morning... ...we'll go and talk to the bank people. You see, the money has to multiply. And so we decided to accept Akusti... ...as of today, as a member of the bank's board... ...as an appreciation of the exemplary thrift... ...and economy, that he has displayed. So, welcome Akusti Harjula! Than you! How can such a simple man become a bank director? The people from Niskavuori are coming! - Good morning. - Good morning, Heta. Welcome to Muumaki, Lovisa. What an imposing house! Just like in Niskavuori! It took its time to be finished... but now it's bigger that Niskavuori. That's why it's so imposing. Good morning, Jaakko. - Welcome, Juhani. - Thanks. Come, Jaakko, I'll show you the stable and barn. The barn's not very big. Just enough for 50 cows. This is our Alina. Hello. Where are Kerttu and Akusti? Akusti is getting dressed. I'll go see. Hey, Akusti, come on, the visitors are here. You call your father by his Christian name? Everyone calls him Akusti. Have you already finished school? What do a farmhand's children need school for? Don't start treating him as a farmhand, in front of visitors. If a man's born a farmhand, he's always a farmhand. No one else thinks that way. He was made chairman of the Agricultural Society branch ...and a director of the savings bank. Do you understand why an ordinary farmhand advances? Because he's an honest, reliable fellow. No. It's because he married a Niskavuori. He's Heta Niskavuori's husband. That's how everyone refers to him. How can you denigrate him like that? I don't denigrate him in front of others. Just relatives. That Akusti of yours has put up some fine buildings. That chest of his must have been a goldmine. Yes... Nobody here remembers the effort that I have put in. For nearly 20 years, I started in the barn every morning at 4.30. But I've finished with that. From now on, others can look after me. Well, here's Kerttu... Such a big girl already. Hello! She's rather pale... just like grandma. - Hello. - Let your uncle give you a hug. I have to go and peel potatoes. They're waiting for me in the kitchen. Kerttu is a bit shy. She's scared of Mum and so on, but not scared of Akusti. Go and find Akusti for us. Otherwise go and tell Gammy to look for him. She wouldn't have time, when she's baking. Lovisa, come and have a look at our new kitchen. Gladly. Hello, Gammy Hello, Mrs Niskavuori. Do you know where the master might be? How would I know that. I thought you would know, Ma'am. - I'm just beating the cream. - Go on beating then. Alina, go and look for Akusti. He could be hiding anywhere. If Gammy didn't look after Dad, he'd be dead and buried. Just do it! Akusti! Hey... Akusti! Goodness, so nice! The verandah window even has coloured glass... ...just like at Niskavuori. It's still a small farm compared to Niskavuori. Not at all... The barn is much finer at Muumaki. That damned Akusti has built the perfect barn. He got first prize for his ox, too! For his bull, my dear... his bull! Bull or ox... they're all the same! Here's Santeri Lammentausta coming as well. What? Who? Listen, Akusti has bought half of Huovila... and Tuomas should be willing to sell the other half. What are you telling me? Hasn't Akusti discussed it with you? Hello, "Mrs Muumaki". Congratulations on the new house! Thanks. Is your wife not with you? Yes, where's Esther? She wasn't feeling well. This must be Jaakko? How does Mr Lammentausta know our Jaakko? We're fellow-parishioners, after all! Good to see you, Mr Lammentausta! Lammentausta has some fine trotters. I see! So you've an eye for horses, Jaakko? I sure do! Jaakko, go and fetch your father! Where is he? Exactly! Where is the master of the house? That's right! Where's Akusti? We're admiring his house, and he's nowhere to be seen. Hasn't had an accident, has he? No. I know what Akusti's like. He could be off somewhere admiring the birds... That master of the house. Where have you been, you runaway?! Let go of me! Heta will just get angry. Where have you been... ...that you've got yourself so dirty? Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but I had to fix the septic tank. Heta forced the covers off because it was leaking ...which affected it so badly... ...that the drains weren't draining and it was getting horrible. What you night call a nasty job. You probably understand that if you're up to your armpits in mud... Go and change your clothes! My apologies for the host, everyone. There's nothing wrong with the host. Don't catch cold, Akusti. Go and get changed. Here we were guessing you were again in the process of buying woodlands. You guessed right. I bought Valkoja's outer woodland this morning. Good heavens! You never said a word about it! Good riddance! He's a real man's man, that Akusti! Is that what you call a host who forgets his guests? Dear lady... I just wanted to tell your husband... ...that he has been elected as churchwarden. Akusti? How could Akusti be a churchwarden?! He wouldn't know how to behave like a churchwarden. What do you mean by that? Akusti is a fine upstanding man! Absolutely! Hey Heta, where is my shirt? Jaakko! What is it? The boys from Kukonoja are trying to reach Tampere tonight. You can travel with them. The White army is on its way there. But Dad doesn't want me to go. Are you going to obey him? The owners' sons from all the farms are going. But if the Reds catches us, they'll kill us. You have guns, of course. You'll go in secret tonight. What if I never come back? Don't talk like that. It's not easy for me to send you away. You're my only son, Jaakko. But if we don't fight them, they'll take house and land from us. But I still need to discuss it with Dad. Be quiet! There's someone in the hall. If you want cakes baked, you're going to have to give me butter... ...from the hidden butter cask. I can't dig it out from under the pantry floor. So you know everything, do you? Who told you that the butter is there? I just knew, I guess. Come and help me, Jaakko. There's enough butter on the top shelf of the pantry. Well, if that's the case... Have you noticed how Gammy acts like she's mistress... ...since Roope became an officer with the Reds? And she'll probably never forget it. Gammy hasn't done anything bad. So long as word doesn't get around the parish that we eat cake here... when others have nothing. If they were to seize anything here... ...so Mum would be screaming at both Akusti AND the Reds. That's no way for a child to talk about her mother. Goodness, Gammy... you're more of a mother to us. Quiet, you silly girl... you mustn't talk like that. Surely you understand that you have to go? What are mother and son doing there with the light dimmed? Everyone sits with the lights dimmed these days. Even with carbide in the storeroom? What's funny about that? Mari Santala was saying... ...that Lehtimaki's son has been shot. Awful. But seeing as they tried to slip through the front line, fully armed... You always defend them! I wouldn't say I was defending. I just try to see the situation from both points of view. If Akusti doesn't take sides... I don't either. If your mother means something to you, don't take it too seriously. You just have to say "yes" and agree. But do what has to be done and consider things first yourself. What good does thinking about it do? Well. I seem to have guessed right, Well, it's not hard to guess what to do, with Mum. That such a calamity should befall our country! Mum wants me to head north. I guessed that. I guess I'll have go... along with the other guys. To shoot your own people. Perhaps you should shoot Jussi Valimaki...- ...or Aarne Maaoja. Or they me! Dad... Why can't everyone just live in peace with each other? It's nice hearing you call me "Dad" for once. Good morning. - How's it going? - Well... Hasn't Mrs Harrila come? No. Though I don't know if they have a horse left. Oh, the times we live in! Say no more... come on in. They called... ...saying that they'd confiscated a bag from our mill stack. I'll be right there. I'll just visit the staff. So they're beginning to interfere with Akusti's property too. That's rather amusing. Come in, Sanni. So they're taking from you, too. That's rather strange. Who knows that they won't take the whole herd, as in Harjula? Yes... They say you should take the best cows... ...to a meadow barn, like they did in Vanaja. It's strange that there's no cellar where they could be hidden. Don't you have anything to do? Go and see if Manta Harjula has arrived. Hello, Alina. Where did you pop up from Mr Lammertausta? - Dad's already left. - Is your mum in? Yes, I'll fetch her. Mum... come out... What is it? Someone to see you. Go and see if the coffee's ready. What do YOU want here? Akusti isn't home. I came to see you. I heard you were thinking of sending Jaakko up north. What about it? Rather than sending him... I have no children. Since Esther died, I've been alone. What's it to do with me, that you have no children? Why do you interfere in my family's affairs? Heta, be reasonable! I spoke to Jaakko. Neither he himself nor Akusti wants for him to go. The farmhand backs the farmhands. Boys from other properties have gone. Why don't you pick them? I like Jaakko. Life is taking so many strange turns. Esther was a mistake. A mistake, eh?! Leave now, before I throw you out! May you someday become human, with a heart! It won't be on account of Santeri Lammentausta. Goodbye! They've come for our cattle! They're in the barn already! Where's Akusti? And Gammy? Get out of our barn, you bandits! Get out of here! You'd do well to keep your mouth shut, Ma'am. This farm can afford to give, like all the others. You're all bandits! Shush, Mummy! Give me that cow! Leave it, Roope! We can't mess with this dame. I said no one dared to come here... ...when the mistress is such a dragon. Get out of here, you bandits! If you don't calm down, they'll take you as well! We wouldn't take her. A harridan like her would scare the devil himself. - Are you still grinning... you gang of murderers!? We'll talk to Akusti first, and then take the cows. That thing's impossible to talk with. - Get out of here! - Mummy, be careful! Good God, Heta, how dare you talk to them like that? Where are you running to? What's that in your hand? The key to Akusti's chest. The smith repaired it. Give it to me! Akusti said I should give it to Gammy. What has Gammy got to do with it? She knows where to store it. Akusti said I had to give it to her. So... to Gammy! What do YOU have to do with the key to Akusti's chest? Nothing. I'm putting it in the master's room. No servants have ever handled the keys before. Daddy said to give it to Gammy. You be on your way! Now we'll see if I'm mistress here. Do I have anything to say about how the farm is run? You decide on everything, Ma'am. Yes... I say what goes, and what doesn't go. The insurrection days are over. What do you mean, Ma'am? There'll be no cause for anyone to get cocky, like Roote with his Reds. What's that there? It'll be a wool sweater for the master. Same as Jaakko's. I take care of my family myself. I'm only knitting it because Jaakko asked me. If you've nothing else to do, it's best you leave the farm! As you wish, Ma'am. You've been cosying up to Akusti for far too long now. There's no choice but that you go. Well, what are you crying about, my girl? Because Mummy's getting rid of Gammy. And I don't want her to go. Don't cry anymore. How is Mummy acting now? I don't want her to go. Gammy has been my only real mummy. How can you say that? Mummy will always be Mummy. You're thinking of getting rid of Gammy? Yes. What has she done to you? You know very well... ...that the children scarcely acknowledge me... ...when Gammy fusses over them the whole time. Is that Gammy's fault? It's alright, is it, that children shun their mother for a base maid? Gammy! Where is Gammy? What do you want with her? Well... It's just something between her and me. 30 hectares, he promised. Of that, 8 hectares are arable land. He promised me 35 hectares and Viljanen... ...though it's poorer soil. How does he do the when the rent tribunal... ...only promised us 20? And he's giving us good timberland. Who ever understood Akusti's reasoning? Do you hear what the other farmers say... ...with you dividing your property in this way? First they say that Akusti is crazy... and then they think I'll be richer like this... so they approve. Well, since the rent tribunal hasn't separated them yet... ...I thought I'd take the law into my own hands. Who's wise to you?! Hello, chaps. Come on in. I guess you know roughly what this is about. Roughly. But Akusti, it's amazing that you bought the Huovila manor... ...and became landed gentry. Can we still just call you Akusti? Of course you can! I'm still only a crofter's son. So I felt I should give you a bit more land... ...if you'll still do the old day's work for another year. But according to the law now, we needn't do any "day's-work". But it's been done for the lord of the manor for centuries... So surely you can do it for me for a year, then be independent. Is that quite clear? Yeah. Guess so. Quite clear. Here I have your agreements. Jokinen's first. Should I read it out to you? You needn't read it. I'm sure it's as Akusti said. I'm sure they are. Sign here. But tell me... How did you become so rich? You haven't sold your soul to the Devil, have you? Well, he never seems satisfied with the souls he has. The Devil can choose or reject. And then, Nieminen. And here, we still have to have your wife sign them. - Is she home? - Oh, yes. But I think it best if I get that signature myself. Well, if that's the case... Shall we wait? Yes... I think that'd be best. Though you never can tell, with Heta. Not on your life! Is this the way you throw your children's inheritance away? Since we're now owners of an estate... ...so maybe you could behave like former ladies of the manor... who had crofters doing "day's-work". You'd well remember the way Mrs Huovila... ...received the crofters at the door. Just forget it! You're just throwing away land to the crofters for free. Well, I'm not doing it for free. No one in the parish does "day's-work" anymore. Imagine the lady of Huovila manor standing at the servants entrance... ...to receive the crofters' gifts. Who'd have believed it, when I took you to our hovel? And haven't I looked after you? You still can. But a lady of the manor doesn't concern herself... ...with questions about crofters. There's some truth in that... But you're throwing our land away! It seems it was too early to celebrate. We have far more farmland and woodland than Niskavuori. Just think about Lovisa's envy! How true is that! So, shall we be moving to Huovila then? That's another matter... but just sign these agreements. They'll all have to bring 50 litres of lingonberries. And bream for salting. Certainly! Here are your signatures. Good heavens! What devilry did you employ, to get them? Maybe I should change my opinion of that daughter of Niskavuori. You needn't to that! You should really take it easy for a bit, Akusti... ...now that you've got Huovila too, to look after. I was thinking of giving it to my son. What does Heta say about that? What do you think? You're a smart man! I already said, you should get a rest... ...now you've got everything you've wanted... ...including the star prize of the Huovila estate. - No what comes next? - Yes, what next? There are two stars that I still haven't reached... Two stars that I longed for, but who didn't care for me. Simply looked at me, coldly and clearly... ...like the stars in the sky. And then more sugar. Cubes or loaf? Yes, loaf. Have you heard that Akusti has bought another property? Haantausta... a good piece of land. Good heavens! There's Akusti coming now. Why is he walking, when he has a new horse? He loaned 10,000 marks to the Workers Union. But they took almost all the livestock from Muumaki. Soon, half the parish will be in debt to Akusti... But they say Heta knows nothing about it. Was there anything in Akusti's chest? Yes, silver and the like. Are you in a hurry, Sir? I'd like to talk to you. No, I'm in no rush. Just going to see Salminen. What is it about? Well, we agreed I should pay this week... for the first installment... but... But you can't? That's right. There have been unexpected expenses. Come tomorrow and we'll discuss it. We'll work something out. That's the border over there. So those fields belong to you, Salminen. So all the best now, to the new owner! I never would have believed that I'd one day have my own land. All thanks to you, Akusti. Don't mention it! And here's our Marjatta, who'll be a maid for Heta. Say hello to Muumaki's master. Hello, and welcome. You must need help, with Gammy no longer with you. No, we don't have Gammy any more. Welcome to Muumaki. Goodbye for now. Wait... I can give you a lift. No thanks, I'd rather walk. I haven't been feeling too well, and the fresh air does me good. Old age coming on... Goodbye for now. Hey, Master! Daddy! Come and help! Daddy, come here! Akusti, Akusti, what's the matter?! Run for help... He has to get to the doctor. Come quickly! Your dad's collapsed. He has to be taken to the doctor. He's gradually recovering. The doctor is on his way. He's out of danger. - What's your name? - Marjatta. - Marjatta? - Yes, Salminen the crofter's daughter Though now we have our own farm. Strange we haven't met before. I've seen you around, but you didn't take any notice of me. Really? I didn't look at you? But now I know you I'm coming as a maid to help your mother. - You're coming? When? - Tomorrow. - Have you been to our place before? - No. Come and see our new foal! How are you feeling, Daddy? I'm alright. Daddy, you're not young any more. You should be resting more... ...when you've struggled all your life, and looked after Heta. Yes, life's had its ups and downs. Now it's coming to an end. Don't talk about it ending! There are so many things I'll never forgive Mummy for. One has to forgive one's mother. I'll never forgive her for driving Gammy out. Gammy... Kerttu... Go and ask Gammy to come here. Take something to eat with you.... ...but hurry up. Are you sick, Gammy? Kerttu! Not... too bad. That foot of mine... ...has just got so bad... ...that i can't always walk. Akusti has sent you some food. And I haven't even eaten my last meal yet. Daddy's rather sick. Sick? Is it serious? He wanted you to come. But I guess you can't, when your foot's so bad. I could try... ...if he's so sick. But it's such a long way. Don't be silly. I'll do it if I have to. Pass me those clothes. Are you awake? I'll read you something. Minister Niskavuori has been on an inspection tour. Fancy Kaarle becoming a minister! Lovisa will be boasting. A man was murdered in ldensalmi. Hit on the head with an axe. Asleep already? You certainly seem poorly. Heta... Would you get me some water? Alina... Get your dad some water... he's thirsty. I haven't nursed you before, and I'm not starting now. You're the one who should be attending me, Heta Niskavuori! Are you going crazy? Maybe I've come to my senses! Some water, Heta!! Go away, Alina! Water, Heta!! There you are. You're going potty. Calm down, now, daddy dear... Visitors are coming, and you need to look spry. Alina... Don't tell anyone that your father went nuts before the end. Honoured Mr Muumaki... a leading man of the shire... chairman of the cooperative fund... and Agricultural Association chairman and... and... What about church warden? And the Livestock Breeding Society... Chairman of the Health Board... Heavens, if I forgot half...! Well then... On account of all your community services...- the government has granted you the title of Shire Commissioner. And allow us now, brother Akusti Akusti - to heartily congratulate you. Thank you, good friends. How did you pull that off?! Well, were there no better contenders in the parish? Well, it happened, didn't it. Though it wasn't my doing. Congratulations, Commissioner's wife. Well, I guess... Thank you all. Come and have coffee. Doesn't the Commissioner get congratulations from his wife? I really don't know how far Akusti has climbed. Oh well... Good luck to you, then. What would I have been without Heta? Just an ordinary farmhand. The main thing is... ...for a man to have soil on his hands... ...and water under his boat. Good, that sums you up. Come on now, and have coffee. Thank you very much. Shire Commissioner...! Hope to see you well again, soon. You'll soon be back on your feet. I'll come back this evening and give you a needle. Thanks, Doctor. It's going to be necessary. Now you just rest for a bit. Tell me, Doctor... Is Akusti's condition serious? Yes, very serious. The Commissioner's life is in higher hands. Gammy...! How I've always liked you! More than anyone else... ...even though Heta produced the children. As now we follow you on your final journey... so we know... ...that going in you... ...is not only Shire Commissioner Muumaki. We shall miss that Finn of few words... ...a gifted and decent man. With you, there departs a noble man, who was always ready... ...to help, even during Finland's darkest years... ...all who needed help. Likeable, cheerful, friendly, you were the same to the very end. Your road through life was hard. Many goals were yet unfulfilled. Your place will be a hard one to fill. There are many things that remain unsaid... But... ...rest in peace... Akusti. Well this certainly looks like the hiding place of the master. The papers are at the bottom. Scissors... nails... screws...- metal fittings... And something wrapped in paper... "For Kerttu" A nice gold broach. Thank you. That would be Mari's broach. Strange that Akusti didn't give it to me. Here's some paperwork. So what's this, then? Looks like I.O.U.s A lot of them. Here's to the deceased Roope Mattila 2,000 marks. To Timo Alitalo, 3,000 marks Matti Lehtinen, 2,000 marks Add them up! His wife and children's money has been thrown around the parish! But every penny will be got back! Well maybe it will all be repaid. How much, Lammentausta? I make it almost 400,000 marks in I.O.U.s What are they? Read them out! Give me them. Well, here's Jooseppi Varala... 5,000 marks to buy a plot of land. - Keep reading! - Yes, yes! Selma Alipelto, 3,000 marks Unbelievable! That complainer! Akseli Kukoinen, student. 5,000 marks for studies. He's a qualified engineer now. Then we have the dean's son. Study loan 6,000 marks. Go on! Workers Union, 10,000 mark Yes... for their building... Unbelievable! Alright. We'll go through them a bit later. Savings bankbook. One million two hundred thousand. And these are Kansallis-Osake-Pankkis shares. At least a half million. What's this, then? It's in Akusti's handwriting. My last will. Give it here. It belongs to me. Shouldn't the Shire Constable open it and read it? Let's see now... My last will is... ...that from my cash, be paid to our faithful maid... ...Hilja Elsa Maanoja, also known as Gammy... ...two hundred thousand marks... ...as recompense for all the years, almost without pay... ...she served at Muumaki. In addition I decree that Jaakko receives the Huovila estate. Yours faithfully Akusti Muumaki That's Akusti. Straight to the point. Such a lot of money to Maanoja Roope's daughter! Never! This is Dad's last will and testament! - The money will be paid. - Yes! It will be paid, yes. This envelope is addressed to Jaakko. Maybe Jaakko would like to open it himself? No Sir, I'd rather it was opened by you, like all the others. Alright, then, let's see what it contains. There is a big I.O.U. in the name of Santeri Lammentausta. Hell...! It's 300,000 marks! So that's where it is! We were guarantors for Paavo Vakkila, when he went bankrupt. Akusti also paid my share, as I was short of money at the time. I'll pay it back now. Unbelievable! You'll be bankrupt first Santeri Lammentausta! Mother! This debt is not false! Why not? Shut up, boy! Akusti told me everything, on his death bed. You know very well why not. And I know that too. So you know. What do you know?! This... that Akusti was an honest and noble man. I'm sure Mr Lammentausta will sort this out. It needs no further investigation. No, and nothing else, either. We'll negotiate with those involved to pay what they can. Don't grieve, Heta, I'm paying my debt. I'll grieve if I want to. It's my own private grief. Akusti is no more. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
