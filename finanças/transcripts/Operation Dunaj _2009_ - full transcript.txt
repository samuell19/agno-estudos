OPERATION DANUBE Dear Yanek, I write to you, as a young armored soldier to an older peer and an armored soldier, and to a hero. Let me introduce myself. My name's Yanek. Yan Yamrozy, but they call me Yasio. I haven't been here long, but I've learned a lot. As my uncle, sergeant Edvard Kotvich says, "the best thing in the world is to be a Polish soldier." War is long gone now. It's hard to become a hero. Polish soldier is always watchful, day and night is on the guard of peace and socialism... It's me!

We have People's country! And it's, damn it, calling you to an oath! We were supposed to... invite the families... Army is your family! Didn't you hear? Army will dress you, feed you... and army will bury you. Soldiers! As you are standing here, in the dark... standing... think soldiers, what's the most important to you? - I'm asking you? - Sleep! Mother, is the most important! And father. At least some of them. But there is... something... something greater... something than mother of your mother's mother and mother... of your father... Grandmother! Holy Mother. Who said that?! You moron! People's Republic is the most important! And it may ask of you anything you want! I see you! Fuck... Did you hear that? That noise? My heart got broken. You swine! Chesio! Chesio! Are you okay? What's the problem? You're the problem, Chesia. - I saw you. - Don't be silly. It wasn't me. - Do you have orders? - What?

Comrades soldiers! The hour of trial has come! Vicious Teutonic hordes reach out their claws for brotherly Czechoslovakia! Gangs of saboteurs lurk to stab Czechoslovakian back with a rusty bayonet! What can poor Czechoslovakian people say? They whine from pain and cry for help! Thank you! Quiet please! I'd like to say few words Listen Gustav! Give it a rest. Let others say something. I don't forbid them to talk. We have freedom of speech. We have freedom of speech. We have freedom. We have a free life. But what kind of life it is? Life is only a short moment. What is brotherly Czechoslovakia to us? It's like a mother. It's like a sister! Who has many brothers. May the loved sister do anything she wants? No. Comrades soldiers! We can't let others fuck Czechoslovakia! Comrades soldiers! To tanks! And to Hradec Kralove! Go! Do it! - Edek, Edek, it's me! - Chesio, what's happened? Nothing. We have an order. You take the Ladybird. Are you serious? She is a scrap. That's why you take her. An experienced veteran. - Form a crew. - But Chesio... It's political decision of the highest command! She is well earned machine in the war, in Czechoslovakia, and it supposed to go at front of the rearguard! Where? Of what? At the front of the fucking back! Cheslav! - 1! - 2! - 3! - 4. Eagles... Romek, what's with you? Did you report? You were supposed to go to commissary. I want to join the tank crew. I am the driver. Do you want it? Have it then. See corporal, this is my crew. But we're going to win this war. Damn it. And do you know why? Because I'm in charge of this tank. Damn it! They're leaving already! This piece of scrap doesn't work. Don't be a smart ass! Just fucking go! And you, eagles... Damn it... Look at you! Damn it! They'll know who to send the glasses to... - Is everything okay, sergeant? - Yes. Why shouldn't be? Go then! Why don't you go, when you're supposed to?! Fuck! Just go, or we'll never going to make it! Kick an old cow in the butt! Maybe I can try? Look at this, we have an engineer. Kvasny! Let the plebe go. Florian, did you pack the food? Of course, sergeant. I raked up all the cans. Oh shoot! Young one has a lucky hand! Crew on board! And this short moment we can spend in the company of this golden drink. Thanks the providence for comrade Kulka. I'm sorry, but... No, I'm sorry. Mr. Kulka, our stationmaster, starting today, will be spending more time with us, with you, Ms Capkova, because in one hour, Mr. Kulka is retiring. - In one hour! - In one hour! But starting today, we're going to be very sad, because our dear Mr. Kulka will be gone. And there will be no one who with eyes closed can count all the coaches from Cierna near Cop. Let long live our stationmaster! And cheers to Andrea! This is Ladybird, Marushia over... Marushia do you copy? Over... - Student! Did you get through? - Only static! - Static noise! - Damn it! Try to get through! And you, Romek, step on it! "Step on it"?! Where? The map is old! Look at the road signs! And to the border! What the heck is that? Some delegation? They're saying goodbye. As if we were going to a funeral. Our funeral... Dear Yanek, as we speak we're crossing the border. Now I know how scared you could have been. Maybe you weren't scared at all. I just don't know. It's like a friendly visit. For freedom... our and yours! Czechoslovakia, brother. Here... even when you piss doesn't go sideways that much. You'll like it here. You'll see. We'll help them, so the Nazi don't henpeck them again. You're joking, right? "Hande hoch!" So how's going, cowards? Thanks student. You know for what. - Aren't you scared? - For you - "corporal". I don't recall being in the same fraternity. Fuck! Who left this stinky liverwurst here?! Couldn't you eat it all?! Now I'm all greasy, morons! So we are in Czech ass. Move it over the chimney! And lift it up! Is it okay? Wait. Hold it. It will go smoothly. - What?! - I have it! This is radio Liverpool! Czech big beat program. Pavel Suhy here, yes! How was it? Shitty. What?! Shitty! How is that? It should go from the recorder to transmitter, to antenna, and to all your backwoods, but it goes, somewhere to hell. let's wait for Petra and my sister they'll bring the amplifier. Okay. - I hear someone singing! - Where?! Downstairs, in the pub. If I were the driver, I'd seriously go nuts. How are Czechs coping without the road signs? You Yanek, were going to Berlin on hunch as well... I'm going left!... we haven't tried left, yet! On August 10, 1968, at 11 pm Soviet Red Army, Polish People's Republic Army, East German People's Republic Army, Hungarian People's Republic Army, Bulgarian People's Republic Army, entered the territory of Czechoslovakian People's Republic. - Is it okay? - Yes. - Move it! - Okay! - Just one more. - No! This one leave it. It is good to know, which way to Vienna. Who would go to Vienna through here? - Are you crazy? - What are you doing? I'd go to Vienna this way. What are you saying? Why to Vienna? I've told you "why" already. Haven't I? I'd like to live as they do. It's so exciting. Isn't it exciting enough for you here? Damn it! Let's move it! They are coming! Thank you child. Thank you my sweetheart. Look at this little dove. Let you long live little dove. This is a work of art. You gave me a really nice gift. The dove of peace. What breed is that? Polish lynx. If it's Polish than it has nothing to do with peace. They have an eagle, man. They'd gladly tore us apart with their clutches. Poles like to fight. They're hotheaded nation. Not all of them are bad. Only the bold one that always shouts. - Gomulka. - Yes. He's acting weird. Flinches as attacked by fleas. Don't think ruling is easy. If Pole came here, I'd chase him away he would run for his life. What if Russians came? I'd chase them away too. They'd run for their lives. Comrade Dubcek keeps an eye on history. And someone has given him a black eye. You should go. Fast train from Ryhnov is here soon. Okay, but I'll be back. Smokes, please. To smoke. Cigarettes, please. - Boring, eh? - It's not Prague... Gentlemen! Play something merry! Just wait. Honza made a bet. He wants to drink a whole trumpet of beer. In the army, I've drunk 3 liters out of half liter bottles... I can't watch that. Mr. Kulka, please. Don't leave us yet I have to. He has to. Andrea. Please give me your shoe. Yizi, what are you doing? You're waking up an animal in me, madam. Well, have it then. Red. I'll drink 10 shoes. Is it alright? Bastards! Corporal, have you seen the train? What train? Where? Easy, uncle. We're going down the road. Dawn is breaking. Another boring day. We have this everyday. What is this! Tractor. No, that's not a tractor. Romek! Watch out! Sweet Mary and Jesus! War! - Something got screwed up. - Can't see shit. All dusty here. If you hadn't shout so loud I'd have stopped. Okay. One of you goes out, to see what's going on. - Student... the Czechs lover. - Me?! Don't play stupid. It's an order. Douche bags! Get out! Good morning. I mean... good afternoon. Get out! Hello?! Is any... one there? Oskarek! Are you all right? Who's going to clean this up? We've made total mess. We cultivate our national tradition. Jesus! Maybe we can push her out? 4 of us? I know why you've got kicked out of university, for stupidity, not politics! Just try, student. 30 tons plus some cans. Hands up! Everybody out! - Translate! - "Ruky do hory!" "Tavarishchi!" - "Niestrielat!" - "Bitte," means "zahaditie," comrades Czechoslovakians. We are Polish. Poland. We bring you peace! Czech society... asked us for help... We like to help. When someone ask us... for help... no matter what... we just come. Honor of Polish soldier is and it has... and we... and it has... and we... it... him and we... it... are going to help. Heroic leg of Polish soldier put the flag in the heart of Nazi hyrda... hyrta for a reason. We don't play softly. This is what allies are for, to have your back. To have your back! Why don't you translate?! Do they understand? You've backed them into a corner. You're getting really unpopular with me. I told them everything, but they still stand like circus bears. - Maybe the gun. - What gun? Can't you take a joke? How do you say, "I like them"? - "Laska." - "Laska?" Kind of stupid. You... and us... together. "Mir..." "Mir." Peace. So hands down. What's with her? Damn it! She wants to piss me off? Let's open a luncheon meat. Mutual meal brings closer. This is Marushia, this is Marushia... Over! Lieutenant Yakubchak reports - back from reconnaissance. - I think our tank... - Quiet! This is Marushia! Over! See corporal, we need to shut the hole. Major is on the air! - Have you been drinking? - Just a beer. See how Czechs welcomed me. I give them bread. They give me a fucking brick! A hollow brick. No, sir, excuse my butting in, this is cored brick. It's not cored, moron. Checker brick, it is. Perforated. I just said that it's a hollow brick, poorly made and soft, Czech shit. Germans make good bricks. Solid bricks. No way you can shatter it. If someone hit you with an air brick from Kielce - you'd be dead meat! - Any of you speak Czech? They're gibbering something... about Polish tanks. There are so many fucking Czechs here, Czesia! I report... that they're talking about Ladybird, because she is lost in action, madam. - What is this! - Perhaps cans? You'll eat all the shoe polish yourself! It was dark. Anyway, it was corporal Kvasny packing. Maybe you ate it on the way! He was devouring all the fucking time. Liverwurst. Sergeant even found the casing! Boys! Boys! What example are we setting? Let's take it easy. You take it easy. - Edek, tell them to get fuck out. - Watch your language, moron. Russian comrades used to say, "the show is off..." "someone stole the fucking accordion". If we need you, we'll call you. "Idi...idu." Go now. Cernik, Dubcek, Svoboda, this is our rebirth! I was just saying, "svoboda," You're free to go! "Svoboda!" Free! Let's not loose the temper. Take it easy. Peace is the most important. You had your laugh. Now give me the key. As People's Army officer... Fuck!... and your husband... I refuse! I can't let you go alone. We're on enemy's territory. I won't take you with me. You're like Jonah. Czech loser throws a core and gives you a black eye. You've offended me, Chesia. As a commander, you cannot leave your post. I'm responsible for everybody. - And I'm going to get him! - Who? - This tank. You're scared to be degraded for losing the tank. - Yes, that's some tank. - Or, maybe, you miss your lover? - You can tell me! - Chesio, don't give me this bullshit. You know... I'll look for them, and... you can be in charge. You're the only one I can trust, honey. You've missed. Keys are under the cast. Only I can reach them. What? Get off! How about treating us with something? - Yeah right, they rush to it. - What? "My home is your home." - With a tank? - We can pay. Pole has a honor. Isn't going to beg. - I don't have money. - I have 1 zloty 20 groshy. Surely we're going to have a feast! Unless we going to trade. Sell them Palace of Culture, they'll set it in Hradcany. Shut up, student! Did you have the time to pack something? You prepare cutlets for the towels. Exchange. Let's swap cutlets for towels. We give you this and you give us grub. Yummy, yummy, swapping? See them, penny-pinchers! Thanks. - Bon appetite! - Thank you. - If you don't want, no big one. - This is how you live by the wits. That's one is hard mother fucker. Let's not be too sophisticated. Is this your hospitality? That's how you treat your guests?! Cutlets made out of towels?!! Sergeant, easy! This is provocation! I thought this is Polish delicacy. This means that the enemy from counter got even here. We came here risking life. Easy! Uncle. We'll make them to like us. You'll see. Yeah, right. We should organize something to eat. To eat, what?! We need to fix the tank! You don't have the tools. Right. We can do nothing with what we have. Gentlemen! Okay! I have a proposition! Let's drink a beer here, then leave this scrap get on the bus and tell them that someone stole the tank. Really, who? Czechs... Czech guerrilla. I mean counterrevolution. Attention! I have a plan, "rebiata." Dear Yanek, I'm with guys in Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakians welcomed us. Can't say a bad word. It's like in Poland, but still different. Peaceful, but still something maybe happening. because people are gathering... Hey Miss! What's up! What's happening? Closed. The door. Czech open the door! Open the door. Let's talk okay? What's happening? - What's written here? - They have rats. Closed. Open the door! We just want something to eat. I will give you... a razor blade. Maybe he can't grow a beard. Okay, without crowns, we won't get anything. White cross... in the open... Damn it! This is fucking waste of time! It's really fucking waste of time We have to burn down this fucking tank! That's just what we need! For others to come next! I'm barely controlling the situation! - Are you really controlling it? - Of course. They'll leave. They'll go! Why would they stay here? Nothing to look for here! Crap! That's what they would look for! I'm so busy with my job, otherwise I'd take a hammer... Uncle, you have no job. There are no horses in town. - Let's take them hostage. - Who? What can we do with them? You, sit down! Calm down. Right now we're the hostages. And no place to have a beer! This is a scandal! If your husband is a foreigner, baby is healthier - That's how you fight? - To fight? With whom? With invaders! You silly girl! We need help. There aren't enough of us! Right, dear? Helenka is ready to fuck a Pole. Bear a liberator... right? Come on. We fight like a married couple. The only thing in common. Unless you count in the lack of love. Listen, this is pointless. I thought you like pointless chat. Thanks to your party, comrades. You're so smart like Voice of America. Where did you... I mean "sir," learn Czech so well? Come on. Don't call me "sir." Call me Florian. Yasio. I've lived in Cieszyn for a year. I used to visit one girl. Seamstress. Luisa Koshtalova. You can say, I know them "inside out." - You murderer! - Thief. Who's next?! - We're hungry! - Take your hands off! Will you slit his neck next?! Fucking shit! He'll shoot! Let it go! He is shooting here! This is my duck! Our! We don't want you here. Get out! But our tank is broken. Our tank has broken... wheels! We want to go, but we can't. - Can you help us? - This is our duck. If I say left, go left! Fuck! Not somewhere else! - Left means left! - Shut up and hold the map! Left hand, the watch! Right hand, the ring! Wedding ring! Wife, marriage, faithfulness! Hold the map, moron! Map, shmap! - What have you done, you idiot?! - We don't need the fucking map! Where should we search? Here or there? Sergeant, we're back. Yeah. I really missed you. - We've captured the ducky. - Yeah! That's not all. We've reached the compromise. What compromise? Well... Agreement, deal, treaty, pact... I know, stupid, what it means. What kind? With whom? Ordinary. Czechs will fix the tank. We're gone. Nobody knows anything. Sounds good, right? Uncle, they're good people. Just talk to them. They will help us. What is this!? "Polaci probudte se." It means "wake up." It's paint. Wait a minute. Attention! Do you want to give away Ladybird to civilians? To foreigners? Your own mother would you sell to pimps! Just for your information... we are at war! You'll fix the Ladybird! Good people are dead already. You trust no one. Do you get it? - No one. - Including you? Cow! And you're a pig! Czech beast. Take her away or I'll punch her! What's with you, Chesio? Have you lost your mind completely? See, the way she stare? Nice eyes, eh? Like a kid... looking for a mother and something warm... I used to look at you... Do you still like me? Yes. I'm helping you to look for the tank - and your lover. - Czesio. And as soon as you find each other, I'll kill you! Yanek, I think it is going to be okay. Nice weather. The best for soaking the feet in pond. Local dog is fawning to us. They even lent us the duck. So I'm not concerned at all. Krechik! Let it go! This is yuck! Don't touch! Everything is fucked up, since they got here. I've told you, we have to blow it up. Let me go! You want me to become a hero, and save it, right? Is that what you're thinking about, dear? No, I want you to decide. Either you're a coward, or you're with me, and we fight together but here not in Prague. In Prague it used to be different. So, are we fighting? - What about, the radio? - We're going to fight with the radio, capeesh? I have an amplifier. Seriously? - Did you bring it here?! - Yes. Give it then! - What do you mean, "give it?" - Just give it. So? Are you with me or not? Honey. Why aren't you at work today, Helenka? Store is closed. Everything is sold. I thought I'd come and help. Stir then. Why aren't you stirring? Stir. When we were still traveling, everything seemed so simple. And now, after the accident, there is a big mess, no food, nobody knows who is a friend and who is the enemy and what should we do. Queen! I won! Who won? I didn't win? I won. And, you sir, are killing the duck. I won't kill it. You were cheating. I didn't. Don't play if you can't loose. I play because I win. I've lost, so you've cheated. Get the duck! I won't even kill the fish for Easter feast. Sir, you just a real pacifist. Watch what you're saying. You've cheated, didn't you? - Gentlemen! - What's happening? Come here! Please. Damn it. Problems again. So... Come on, people. Move your asses, or I'll eat it myself. Here you go. Bon appetite! Yasio, come to eat! Freeze! - What? Excuse me? - I'm in charge here, and I say, freeze. I have to think. No way now you're going to starve us! Clap us in irons as well. What a yummy, dumplings, with gravy. They're not the dumplings they're "knedliki." What's the difference? As long as they're superb. What do you mean there's no difference? Dumplings are made of flour, "Knedliki" of potato or bun. "Brambor" or "housk" knedliki. They wouldn't hold without the flour. Shut your holes! Hungry, are you? - Have you repaired the tank? - I was working on it. Show me your hands! Dirty. Wash them. Wash them I say! Do you want to eat? Okay. And you? Sit down. - God, this is poetry. - What if they want to poison us? Why would they do that? I don't know, damn it. We are at war. - It looks too good. - Who would like to poison us? What do you mean "who?" Them Czechs. Damn it. We came to fix it! They came to fix the tank! I see!... Just in case give them the burst of fire. But I only have a knife, the one for cans. If they're to repair, they should eat first. Welcome. Please... sit down... at the table. Please, sit down. Delicious "knedliki." - Made of potatoes. - They're not potato ones. They're made of bun. Thanks. Let's go for a walk. For a walk. For walk... Okay, just a moment... I only... Life is beautiful, Yasio. - Especially in Czechoslovakia. - Why "especially" in Czechoslovakia? Because they have "knedliki," soft as girl's fingers. Here, they don't keep the bedpan full of shit, just in case your neighbor walks by. It is different than in Poland. We have this and that. We have our honor. But in Poland, even scratching your ass is a matter of honor. Honor is not bad. Honor is honor. Maybe. Hold it. Jesus! Helenka! Where are you?!... Helenka! - Damn it, hold it properly! - Don't patronize me! I'm sorry! After yesterday, I'm exhausted... Put some led inside, after few kilometers they'll be stuck. Sir, are you insane? You know what could happen to us later? Mr. Kapsa, you don't appreciate the importance of patriotic risk. Look at Poles, last war they fought with swords against tanks. What are you trying to say, Mr. Hazuka? What are you trying to prove? It is obvious. We need to stay calm and calculate. If you want to go crazy, like folks during WW II, don't be surprised country is left at ruin. Damn it, shut up. Let it go and hold this! He is pissing me off! - You've got so scared... - Shit! Bugger!... Here. You're here in the sun... You don't have the slightest idea how it was in the woods. How we suffered for Poland, how scared we were... - Uncle, why are we here? - Don't you know it? I remembered what they said. I want to know if you thought about it. If I wanted to be smart, I'd play football not joined the army. Why do we need to protect them? Nothing bad is happening here. No Germans, or saboteurs... Yasio, you're so emotional. You sit at backwoods, you've seen nothing, and you think that you know it all. Do you know where the counter is hiding? - In the woods! - And... so? Maybe we could send some patrol? Don't move your ass if everything goes well. Do we need more trouble? Chop the wood! Hot. I want to see your horse. Show it to me. Don't be shy. If you are sweat, let's go swimming. I came to help... absolutely... I came... to help. I wanted to... help. History shows that wherever Poles go they make a mess... I mean... trouble. It's hard to say, why. You can care less because you're different. You have an inner light. An inside glow. As Bretislav Dudek, genius, barely known Czech poet, wrote: "In the wind, depriving dry branches of recollection of careless days, only one flame is burning, pure, hot, last..." It's nice to see you, boy. You need to peel the potatoes. And we, Lindunka, are going to prepare the rabbit. Helenka! Where are my things? Where is my uniform? I'm doing laundry. Eh, you...! Leave it! - Did you turn on the radio? - Radio, yes. I fixed it. Did you fix it? - Almost. - What is your name? Name... your name? Yasio. I mean Yan. Sounds good. Cheers then... To mom. - What about you? - Petra. Hurrah?! Will it work? These are different radios than in Prague. So the amplifier I brought is totally useless?! How we supposed to peddle this manifest? - What manifest? - Where do you get those ideas? I am an intellectual man and not some musketeer. I won't get killed for your beautiful eyes... - Intellectual, right? - Yes. Well, then think! This is so sad. It is pity that... that someone like you, has to get so dirty, Come on... It's just a rabbit. I mean in general... I mean sta... - To stain? - Yes, "to stain." You are made... for something better. - She can't speak. - Excuse me? She can't hear and speak. Since her birth. Sweet Jesus and Mary!!! Michal! Can you hear it? Andrea is shouting. Who was the last to see Mr. Kulka? I'm stewing rabbit in cream like every Wednesday. But this dove... Look under the tank. What's happening? Helenka! Look under the tank! Maybe he is still alive? Come! Can you see anything? I can't, it's dark! We have to lift it up! Come! All at one side! Yirka, look under the tank! 1, 2, 3, and now! I'm here! Help! We're coming! Damn it, they're always stuck! Yirka supposed to fix it! Now the man is going to die! - With the battering- arm! - What? Watch out there, inside! Out of the way! Help! - But there is a man, careful! - Move back! Fuck!... I would let him go at Russians with this ax. Wait, careful... I'll take him from underneath... and I'll grab him here... But where are we carrying him?... Will you just stand there or will you help us?... Instead of the rabbit. Maybe we should cover his face? Come on, Gustav! Czech! We were just... talking. He is breathing. Maybe that's the last breath? Sir? He had this already, didn't he? We should lift his feet, or lay him on the side? Damn it! Will you do something already?! He is alive! Hurray!!! I just got up so you don't have doubts, that I am dying... Now and here. In town where I got rejected, Among people, who forgot me - How could we?... - Such a disappointment. And now, at the end of my service... so felicitous. Farewell hearts made of stone. Leave my sister you pig!... Sister? Brother-in-law you need to calm down! - I told you we're going to get lost! - Yes you did. The whole life you only talk. Even then, in Kozieglovy... Do you remember? When they ordered us to guard the palace... Of course, I remember. It was cold, wasn't it? We had to burn the furniture. You were some piece of ass a game to anything. But you, Chesio, were not. You were constantly talking about partisan and bullshit, instead of showing some action. My man. Oh, man, all these years, crazy things... Garrisons in Peoples Republic, wandering, always together. Wherever you go, I follow. Chesio and Chesia. I couldn't go without you. Hey, Chesio, are you crying? - Why? Don't cry! - Fuck! My leg is on fire! Under our tree. Why aren't they fixing it? We'll be here till New Year's! - Be quiet, please. - Why should I be quiet?! Fetch me a beer. Wait, maybe he wants to say something? It's cold in here... and sad... you could play some music... Petra? What are you doing? Leave it! You'll get a shock! Leave me. Let it go. You'll see... Now we won't be able to connect. And we'll stay here... forever! Then go back to Poland on foot... Move it! Wait! Let me go, you idiot! Keep you mouth shut. Or I'll slit your throat! For 40 years I had my own chair here, table with my name on it... and on my table... You've killed it! Bird murderers! - What birds? - Columba domestica. You've run over his dove. It was a gift. Columba... what? He said that we run over his dove. - Idiom of some kind, I guess. - Idiom? Dove? Where? But... damn... - Ask what breed it was. - Excuse me! - What breed it was? - Polish lynx. Damn it. I used to have Polish lynxes, 4 pairs. Our sergeant... - used to hid... - Breed. I mean, had...bred. I didn't hide this dove. For 20 years I've had my own. - Petra, give me this screwdriver. - I don't collaborate with aggressor. You're calling me aggressor? I came here to protect you from Germans. You are an idiot. Mr. Kulka has been breeding doves since his childhood. He crossed whole country after those birds... During the war he used to be only a guard. Not just a guard. He was the most handsome... Then the new government came. The first one had a respect for him, but the next one which came in 1948... 48, 48... that's different, I don't want to say, why... But Mr. Kulka stayed calm and kept his position, because peace is the most important for him. But then Mr. Capek came. - My Vashek. - Vaclav for you. Exactly. And now starts the story with the balloon. - Now the story about the balloon. - Balloon? Ask about the doves? Sergeant wants to know if you have more doves. So, he can murder them, isn't it? Difficult grammar. Tell him that I'll send him a pair of lynxes by mail as reimbursement. Sergeant proposes to send you - a pair of doves. As a gift. - And you want to send us doves? It's not enough for you to bring this dove of peace Don't provoke... Don't be aggressive. The dove of peace! Stay calm, boys. Peace. Let's drink. - What do they want? - He is wondering, if it was a good idea to come. He says that we could say, "No." Soldier listens to orders. If Czechs weren't messing around, we would be home playing cards. Sergeant is sorry. He is angry at the command... for misleading us. - Misleading?! - Yes... Mistake?... Well. He says that it's better to have a drink than to fight. We have a rabbit here. Comrades, ladies and gentlemen, it is done beautifully... Do you understand this? Now they'll drink and eat together. Makes me sick! I surely hate them! Do you want to leave? If you go, I'll tell them that you wanted to sell radio. What? ...that you wanted to sell me this radio! - Would you lie? - Yes. But if we left together, they would think... you know... that you and me... Do you understand? - Now! - Not yet! Now! What did you think? You see. You've finished first... and I was still. How was it? It was good, Romush! Superb. You see. Romush? Romush!!! What the heck is this?! Did you skin a penguin? I washed my uniform. It stunk too much. It's drying now. You've washed it!? See the skunk! He sold his uniform and plays stupid. Are you out of your mind? - Corporal! - Calm down. I gave it to him. It used to be my husband's. It looks good on him. Romush, sit down. Edek, please eat. Eat! Yes, Vaclav used to play a big master. He used to go to Church like this and shopping, as well. He'd gladly dressed everyone in tuxedos. He said that clothes make the man. He sawed some for me. But where could I wear it? No place to wear it. Mr. Capek, liked the new government even less than Mr. Kulka. I don't know how he survived so long, right?... I know, but I won't tell. Maybe I know it too. I tried your "knedliki." They were friends with Mr. Kulka, but... May I say this? There was a woman between them. Let's leave this... They wanted to leave, but how? All borders were closed. You couldn't travel. Everywhere secret police. Only sky was free of borders. So, they've decided to run... into the sky. Into the sky? Into the sky. But where? To Vienna. What, to Vienna? You wanted to go to Vienna. Have you been there before? I'd really wanted to go there. I'd wanted to see the Eiffel Tower too. You aren't so smart, right? But, you're okay. I mean... you have a good heart. Like my dad, Vaclav. Mr. Capek made this big tent, excellent work. Instead of the basket they used old barrel. I made the lifting eyes for the ropes. I remember. There wasn't enough material, so he asked Vlhkova from culture center, to give him old banners from party parades there were no blue ones, only red and white. He made a beautiful balloon in Old Czech national colors. Interesting. Her husband... made a balloon in Czech national colors. - I mean balloon... like the flag. - Was the balloon in the air? It was flying! He made it to Vienna! To Vienna, I see. I saw balloon like that, in my... Where? Edzio, do you live near Vienna? - I know what I saw. - Perhaps you were drunk. What's the difference? If I saw it, or not. There are many balloons like that. It couldn't have been Vaclav's balloon. Vienna isn't in Poland, right? Maybe, I was daydreaming. Look at me! Look at me and listen. I wanted to steal the amplifier for the radio. Do you know why? To tell everyone that you're here! We don't want you here! Go to hell! Tell them this! Go on, tell them! Why not? I feel... I feel ashamed that we're here. Don't shoot the shit, corporal Yakubchak. that headquarters are worrying! I'm telling you, everything is fine here! There are no problems! I am a step away from localizing Ladybird. But you should report what's new not me! Are you fucking crazy? Or drunk? Over. I report to be sober as a judge. Everything is fine here. In reference to stolen tank, I received an operational back up from our Russian comrades What do you mean Russian comrades? Dickhead! Over! I didn't report anything they know everything! Everything, They are real psycho... psychic... They're magicians! Easy! Yurek. Forget about it. Fuck it Now you are the commander. No... What do you mean by "no?" My dear comrades... - Shall we drink to victory!? - To victory. Death to counterrevolution! Death to all. Over! Chesio! Chesio, is it you?! Are you okay, Chesio?! 23 years after war and still in target. 6 times - bull's eye! Are you wondering if I counted correctly? Mr. Capek really built this balloon. Beautiful. But the day they were supposed to fly local party informers and secret police nosed out the whole deal and were trying to stop them So Mr. Kulka risked his own neck, and Mr. Capek could flee away. There's no need to dwell on it. Well, anyway... continue, I'll go to the toilet. - Careful. Don't get locked in! - Don't lock the door, Michal. Okay, since he is gone, I'll tell you the real version of this story Mr. Kulka spent the previous evening tasting the apple cider at the butchers, Mr. Blaha. Next morning when Mr. Capek was waiting for him, he was sitting at the top of the bell- tower, in his stationmaster red cap trying to remember where he's left his pants was it at Mrs. Blahova, butcher's wife, or at Mr. Jiraska's wife, local confectioner? One way or the other Capek flew away to freedom, and Mr. Kulka was sneaking back home, wearing only his jacket... Maybe even without a jacket. Do you understand? Well... frankly speaking... Mr. Kulka was one of a kind himself. Oskarek. Maybe it wasn't like that at all. Everyone is guilty of something. What? Mention something about the tank. But no rush. Gentlemen, what's with the tank? What's with the tank? Well tank... is there. I see that. But will it work? I don't understand? Will it drive? Will it work again? Well, either will, or won't. Life is full of mysteries... Jesus Christ, what's happening?!! Lidunka! Just look at that! Tomcat chatted up a pussy. - Some epidemic? - She... I mean Petra. I invited her to show her the tank. Within the framework of establishing the relationships between us and community. I showed her how it works. Can you tell me what have you been doing with this soldier? Nothing. Hey, chap, what are those cables doing here? What's this? Fucking shit! You've fucked up our tank! What's more, together with this Czech slut You shithead! Leave him! Fuck! What are you staring at?! Defend your commander! None of you will move the ass? Because you don't care! about the honor... and Poland. You're same as Czechs, if they give you beer and food you don't care if they shit on your plate, you'll keep devouring! Do you think that Pole would house a German have a beer, and meat if he destroyed his house with a tank?! - Jesus Christ, give it back... - I didn't take it! What do you want?! Have your radio! This is Beetle, this is Beetle. I've located Polish tank taken hostage. We're going to recapture it. Over. What did he say? Florian, tell the commander that Russians located you. They're coming. They're coming to recapture us. So, I guess you're going to flee? Damn it! - Where are the tools? - Here! Comrades soldiers... on behalf of our community, we prepared a gift for you. Dry provisions. So, they've prepared the chow for the road. Let long live Polish-Czech friendship! Likewise. - Edek, do you have my address? - Yes. Farewell then. Go now! In 5 minutes there is a train to Rychnov I'll accompany you. Best of all no one got hurt, and I've met Petra. Maybe we'll meet one day. Romek, wait! Russians! They're beating ours! I mean Czechs! I mean our Czechs! - Let's go! - What? No, just put in reverse! Yasio, don't talk shit! Romek! It's an order! Florian, help! Florian, load it up! Yasio, do you know what you're doing? - Have you heard the order?! - Load it up! Let them long live! Let's go for a beer! To victory! Only one bullet... only one... I was supposed to die... Wait Yizi... We're going home. Let me help. You've helped enough. You think it's our fault, isn't it? You go and they'll crucify us. They don't want us here, do they? Let's go then! Sit down, Romek! We can't revive Lidunka. And now what?... Stay. - Helenka, don't start. - Just wait. She is right! You'll get rid of the uniforms, hide the tank in woods, and we'll hide you. - We'll fight together. - And they'll do us all. I'm not staying here! I'll go with you! I agree with Helenka. We can't leave you here. And we can't stay. - We all have to go! - But where? To Vienna. To Vienna. To Vienna. Who is going to Vienna? Uncle, if you want you can go with us. You'll be free. Would you take me with you? Yasio... Yes...? Take care of her... She is fragile like... a porcelain doll... You have to... - love her... you know. - I know. Petra is... Who is Petra? I'm talking about Ladybird... Damn it. Yes, sir! Uncle. Poles are playing war and we must clean after them. Where will I get so many bricks? I'll sit on the phone all day, if they switch phones. at the switchboard. Maybe switchboard doesn't exist anymore? - What do you mean? - Just like that... Here used to be an Inn. Kaboom! Inn is gone. Maybe they did the same in Prague. And the "switchboard" is gone. Jesus Christ... so "switchboard" ...is gone... So?... - We should say goodbye? - Say goodbye? Why? You're not going to Vienna, are you, sir? What would I do there? Vienna is a big city. It needs strong people. I'm not a Hercules. You are for me. Can I call you by your first name? Andrea. Oskar. - We need to say goodbye to them... - Come on. Will they be okay in a big city? Helenka, there is no more room. Darling, just push and stop talking. I won't go naked to Vienna. Come on... I'll find dad and you'll join us there... Find dad, but I'm from here, you know... Yasio is a good man, stick with him. Okay? I love you mom... At least our doggy is staying. I love you. If something happens to her... I will... Will you give me a lift to the station? But stationmaster is not here, he really wanted to go. They used to go to Vienna often, but not anymore. Don't wait up for him. Here! - I'll get them! - Slow down! Damn it! Slower my ass! Faster! - What can I get you? - Have you seen the tank? - What? - Tank! Tank, here?! No. There are strange things driving here, but no tanks... I'd have a beer. I have money. No, no! Leave it. I will add to your bill. - Get on the bike. Let's go! - Where do you want to go? Somewhere... Follow them! Moron! Somewhere doesn't exist. To drive, you need to know where and why. And you got a mixed up of important with shitty. I'll tell you what's important. Either you're somewhere, or with me? And I'm here and... drinking beer. - Right? - That's right. You know what? You're complete loser! Chesia! Faster, faster... There you go. What's that? This is for Russians... Yes, sir! It's from partisan times. Good. Jesus Christ! That's him. Edek. It's my dove. Polish lynx. Dear Yanek, I won't write to you anymore, we're starting a new life with our friends, we managed to complete one thing, which you could only dream about, we've chased away Russians. Now, I'm in charge of Ladybird, and we're going to end this war. - Is it important? - No! So it flies! Mom used to say, that third kiss makes a charm, I don't know if it's true. I don't know what awaits us in Vienna. Maybe this scrap won't even make it. Dad probably thought the same getting into the balloon. But you don't know unless you try.
