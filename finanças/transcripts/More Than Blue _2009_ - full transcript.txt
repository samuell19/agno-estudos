I need it for the drama next week so tell him it's great! Like Seung-chul ever listens to me. Then make him. He's gotta do this song. But the lyrics are weak, man. What the suits say goes. That's show biz. Whatever, man! - Hold up! - What is it? You like this song? Of course! Why? Singing about a girl to come back to me at my age? My heart this and tears that... Isn't it childish? No! It's perfect! Don't you think? It's great. Make your fans really feel the song, man! But I don't feel anything! You can do it, man. Feel me? - It's great! - No. It's not working for me. Seung-chul! Come on! Get him! Seung-chul! Yes, director. I see. KWON Sang-woo KWON Sang-woo Next Tuesday? The song's a killer. LEE Bo-young LEE Bo-young Nothing but the best from LEE Seung-chul. Nothing but the best from LEE Seung-chul. Of course. LEE Beom-soo LEE Beom-soo No problems whatsoever. Yes, sir. Take care. JUNG Ae-yeon, LEE Han-wui Yes, sir. Take care. JUNG Ae-yeon, LEE Han-wui See? He's asking for the song. Do it for me? Executive Producer KIM Gwang-soo See? He's asking for the song. Do it for me? You always do this to me. Please? So get me a good song and I'll sing it! Damn! Producer HONG Jung-pyo So get me a good song and I'll sing it! Damn! Producer HONG Jung-pyo So get me a good song and I'll sing it! Damn! What about 'Hee-ya'? 'Hee-ya, please look at me.' Give me a break. That was a hit only cuz you sang it. Wanna hear this song I got? What is it? It's off a flopped album. Forget it, kid! Let's hear it. Really? Turn it on. To give you everything and all my love... Who wrote this? The lyrics are great. Really? Then let's ask them to write our lyrics. Who wrote this? Not sure. I got this off someone. Who? Min-chul. He used to work for KIM Gap-sik. Gap-sik? I know him well. Hey, didn't he leave the biz? Who does your friend work for now? He left the biz, too. What does he do? He runs a cafe in Chung-pyung. Wanna go over, Seung-chul? - Know where it is? - Yes. Lead the way. Director WON Got the album? Ah, here. What's the title? It's the second track. Second track? 'No one else like Thee' by Cream? What's her real name? I think it was EUN Won. Yeah, that' s it. Got her number? She's gone. Gone? To where? Right after KANG Chul-kyu left... KANG knows her well? Of course. He was totally in love with her. Do you have KANG's number? - He died. - He's dead? When? About a month after he married off EUN Won. Mr. KANG! What was the name of his show? 'Ugly Ducklings in Love'. Yeah, that's it! He married off the woman he loved? - What does that mean? - Well... Tell us what happened. It's a long story. Hi, Chul-kyu! KANG said he saw stars when he first met Cream. Why you little punk! Like he'd been slapped on the back of his head. He said it was love at first sight. Without even talking to her. I asked, 'Shouldn't you at least say a few words, first? ' Then he said... If you need words, then how can mutes love? How did you know my name? Isn't it a waste living in this big place alone? Want me to live with you? Think of a name for me, and I'll make one for you. We can't change our names. Why not? Her name is Cream and my name is K. She was cold like ice cream, - but also sweet like ice cream. - The curtains won't do. We're changing everything. And she was soft like ice cream. And I'm not A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K... But just K. We had a lot in common. We were the same age. We both liked noodles. We loved listening to music on rainy days. We loved coffee. We hated school. She liked me. And I liked her. And we were both orphans. Prison and love... Once you're stuck, you can't get out. I fell in love with Cream. Even the very air she breathed. Romeo must've been so worried... Ioving Juliet, but afraid he might lose her. Why did he drink the poison? Perhaps he knew. To love someone - is to give her everything. - I'll visit often. I received so much from her like the catcher who gets the ball. Love was like dry ice. Sometimes cold, sometimes hot. Wait! Cream was so loveable. But I couldn't tell her that I loved her. Cuz I had cancer cells in me ready to strike at any time. More than Blue Thank you, Mr. KIM. It's the least I can do. Writers need to eat well to do all that thinking. Have some soup with the Kimbap and chew carefully. Is this your new singer? Greet them, girl. They're the best writers in SBC. Hello, I'm Cat Girl. I promise to sing my heart out. Damn right you should. Great outfit. It's a new concept. She's a cat. It's Cat Girl. This gal's got brains. She's a student at Seoul University. Really? It's Seoul University of Arts. Who's side are you on? You could get in trouble for lying about schools these days. If you're so holy, go be a cop instead. Sorry. Mr. Kang! How are you? Here's Seung-chul's new album. It's deep. - It's a sure hit. - I'm sure it's great. - Say hi. - Hello. Call me K. Let's go for drinks some time. - Sounds great. - Bye. Seoul Univ. of Arts. Same difference. That's right. Did you eat, sir? Mr. Kang! - How've you been? - I waited so long for you. She's Cats. Damn, I keep forgetting. It's Cat Girl, sir. Go on and introduce yourself, girl. I'm Cat Girl. I promise to sing my heart out. Thank you. Of course you should. Let's go some place quiet to talk, Mr. Kang. See you folks later. - Come on, what are pals for. - I can't. It's just a show of my appreciation. The album's finished? I put together all the best songwriters around. You know me, I get what I want. How is she? Oh, her? Not bad. But she has trouble getting along with the others. Still she's got talent. Be nice. Of course. Anything for you. - But do this for me. - I can't. It's not much. Please, take it! I can't sleep at the thought of you. My dear love. That part you just sang. Try not to scream it this time. You'll scare 'em off. How, sir? How would you feel if someone screamed they loved you? You know, softly and tenderly? You're good at that. What? Not that. Stop making me do it. - That's not what I meant! - Roll it! What's she so good at? Drop it will ya, man? Come on. Just between us? She's my future. That's all I can tell ya, man. Did you fix the second verse? What? The climax on the second verse. 'AIways like yesterday'? It's a little corny, isn't it? 'A world without love? ' How's that? Like that's not corny? It's just a suggestion. Let's not get too excited here. You two write it, then. I'm out. What? So feisty. Do you have to become a singer? What? Got enough medication left? My damn connection to your family. First your father, now you. There are too many illnesses that can't be cured. What's wrong? What is it? Don't cry. Stop crying. The bastards told me to rewrite it. 'lf I could live again'. How's that for the title? 'lf I could live again? ' If you could, what would you like to be reborn as? Besides a person? Anything. Well... If I could live again... A ring? Wait. Start over. If I could be born again... A ring. A pair of glasses. A bed. A diary. Born again as things like that? What fun is that? You can buy me. It'll always be fun at your side. So sensible. Did you eat? Of course, I did. Well, I didn't. Then let's eat. Is there anything you want to tell me? Like what? A deep, dark secret? Think of it as a confession at a Catholic church. I'll be the priest and listen. A deep, dark secret? Say anything. I'm ready to listen. I like you. I want to ask you something. Do you have a wish? A wish? If you could have anything in the world? First, hold up your spoon. Then? Eat all your food. Then? Meet a great guy and get married. Can't I marry you? I'm not a great guy. It wasn't my choice, but heaven's will, to fall in love with you. I was born to love you. Heaven sent me to love you. ID: Little Mermaid. Now, for the requested song. Your second toe is longer than the first one like mine. That means your mom will outlive you. Who says that? I think I read it somewhere. It's a lie. Why? Cuz my Mom and Dad died on the same day. If you... If you die before me, I'll kill you! Here's another requested song. Are you finished? Excuse me? The coffee. Then can I have the cup? Which side did you drink from? Pardon? This isn't kissing, is it? - Hey. - Yeah? - You know the guest doctor? - Yeah? What kind of doctor is he? Huh? We need to fill a cavity. Amalgam is stronger than resin. We kiss on the first day. You see inside me, on the second day. What should we do on the third day? What? We'll decide when the time comes. I'm in love! A guest on another show. He's a dentist. Pass me the toothbrush? You're listening to 'Happy Hour'. - As you're out driving... - Did you eat? Oh, hi. - Got a show to record, today? - No. The guest doctor on your show... Who? You mean CHA Joo-hwan? How is he? He's a great guy. Why? Just wondering. His family's rich, he's nice, and he makes a ton of money. And he's a famous dentist. You look a little sad today. Good job, bro. It was fun. - Great show. - Cut it short. Hey, nice seeing you. Let's go out for drinks. Not if it's just a few drinks. - How much then? - All night? All night! Alright! What's his social security number? - 730313105... - 730313... Sure you can get his medical records? Insurance companies get everything. But why do you want to check out a guy? I'll tell you later. Bingo! He's got life and medical insurance. No record of family illness or any operations. He has an impeccable health record. You sure? Insurance companies know how to make money, man. KANG! If he has a hospital record, we'll see it. KANG! Thanks. I owe you one. Got a minute Mr. KIM? For you, any time! It's a gift. Ah, thank you. Just a thank you? First my lips, then my insides... Now, you're in my head. Buy me a drink? A drink? I don't get it. Who would've thought I'd use my former dark roots to help you? No need to worry. Now about Cats. Man, I gotta change that name! It's Cat Girl, sir. I know! It's up here but I can't say it right! Call me whatever you want, hon. Who cares if it's a cat or a dog? That's my pretty. My sweet Cats. We're changing the name. - Ah, sir? - I said, I know! Not that. The phone. Sorry, Producer KANG! I checked and... You kids scram for a sec. I gotta take this call. Go! CHA Joo-hwan's family's loaded! He even has a hot fianc?. He's got it made. Fianc?? Is something up? Oh, you dropped your candy. Let's put it in your pocket. Have you ever been in love? Like a rock thrown into the river. Give me the ring. Excuse me? Your ring. Like this. Someone to pull you out. Like this. I'm engaged. It doesn't matter. Let's keep drinking. It's so cold. Did you drink? What do you like so much about him? I feel like I'm being sterilized. Sterilized? Sterilized. Perfect. - Let's eat. - Sorry, I gotta run. - You're not eating? - I can't. What about all this food? You eat it all. I'll see you later. ABCDEFGHIJK... Hello? Is this EUN Won's number? Yes, it is. May I speak to her, please? She's not here. My name's CHA Joo-hwan. We were supposed to meet today but something came up at the clinic. Is there any way I can reach her? Where were you going to meet? So cold. Hey. He can't come. Who? Him. The doc. Where are you going? I gotta go. Sit down. The curry here is great. You know I don't eat curry. Then what do you want? What else is there? What do you want to eat? Kimbap. So boring. Just eat curry. You're buying. Come on Producer KANG. Spill it. Did he rip you off or something? Then, why didn't you say so! My boys can get the money back before lunch in no time. It's not that. Then what is it? Why would someone like you want the dirt on some guy's fianc? even? Are you interested in his fianc?? Just find out, please. Fine, then. Anyway, Cats' album's startin' to get noticed, now. Let's cook up something with your show and sell 'em like hot pancakes! I'm sure it'll do well. Of course. Hey, Min-chul! Did you like the house? Mother said she liked it. It's not bad. I heard you stopped holding exhibitions. I'm tired of putting on shows. And there's nothing to take pictures of. I'm sorry I'm not more fun to be around. Don't worry. I like to have fun by myself. That's sad. - Let's have fun together from now on. - Sure. Can I get an ashtray here? I'm sorry. There's no smoking here. The world's such a bore. Get her an ashtray to put that out, please. Yes, sir. Interesting. Keep smoking. Should've known. She's really somethin' all right. She's got men coming out of her ears. I told 'em to take some good pics. It won't be long. How did you pose for your album cover? I posed like I practiced with my boss last night. Exactly how? - Here? - Pardon? Men are all the same. Okay, then. First, I open my eyes like a cat. Like this. - Ah, Cat Girl? - Then... I hold my hands up and open my mouth like this. Look at her. She's a natural born star! You can just tell us. But my boss said a star - has to speak with the body. - See that? Girls like her adjust so quickly. That foxy babe. Who wouldn't love her? - Ah, sir? - KANG! - What's wrong? - KANG! Where is he? - Hey! - I'm dead beat. What's wrong with you! What's with you! Don't start. Why does he keep fainting like this? It's hereditary, but it could also be not enough calcium in his diet. We've been eating the same food in the same house for years! Why are you the only one who keeps fainting! You eat way more than I do. You're only eating anchovies from now on, got that! You! Yes? What did he just say? To break off your engagement... - Stop! Please! - Who are you! What the hell are you trying to pull! You don't wanna mess with me! Get the hell out of my sight! I said, get lost. Why are you doing this? Huh? You're a successful radio show producer. Trailing a woman and getting slapped like that. Aren't you embarrassed? I don't have time to be embarrassed. What are you talking about? One mountain after another. But no time to go. Ow, my head. Does it hurt? I'm hurt, too. What's with me today? It's cuz we're sad. Then cry instead of making jokes. I don't want to cry. Don't wanna make someone cry even more. I'm dying. Just like my dad. Chul-kyu! Mom left me a year after Dad died. It probably wasn't cuz she resented me. She was sick of everything cuz of Dad. I understand. I was sick of everything, too. But when she left me all alone... I was so Ionely. People... should never be alone. I'm sorry. I want you to leave your fianc?. The girl that I love is in love with him. - Medical records- The girl that I love is in love with him. I beg you. Under one condition. But... But? No, please! Tell me. I want to take your pictures. Your medical records said you don't have much time left. Now, that's an interesting model. I think it'll be fun. I don't think it'll be fun. Then the deal's off. Drink up, first! Give me a drink, too! - Hi! Hi! - Hi! You're late! Hello. I spoke to you on the phone. Oh, hi. I'm KANG Chul-kyu. CHA Joo-hwan. - Thanks again for that day. - Anytime. You know him? The sterilizer? - Did you eat? - No, I'll eat now. Why are you so late? - Still recording a show. - What? You said you're done. Not yet. I gotta go back. - Here. - Thank you. The song's great. 'lf I can live again'? Of course, I wrote it. Sorry, I gotta run. - Come on. - Don't go. I'll see you later. Bye. - See you next time, then. - Sure. Be careful in the snow! Why are you back so early? Aren't you supposed to be recording a show? Change of plans. Me, too. Drink this. Didn't you eat? I did, but I'm still starving. Why are you eating noodles instead of rice? Just wanted something simple. It's good, huh? If you could stop time, what would you do first? If everyone else is frozen and only you can move? If time stopped, you wouldn't die. Don't you want to live? Not talking to me? Too sorry to die and leave the girl you love alone. Okay, I can understand that much. But still... How can you marry her off to someone else? Isn't that going overboard? You're not dead, yet. - How can you watch that? - Ah, Jenna? Let's just stick to ourjobs. What's love? Like brushing your teeth. Brushing your teeth? But you do that alone. Do you brush to show someone? Why didn't you come yesterday? Pardon? I said, did you wait for me? Well, just wondering why you didn't come. You fell in love with me, didn't you? What? Love makes you wonder and wait for that person. It's not that. If a patient doesn't come, I wait. Do you wonder about every patient? Well... You're blushing. It's love all right. Hey, KANG Chul-kyu! Yes, boss. How much did you get from KIM Gap-sik? Should've been more discreet! Cat Girl's on your show 10 times a week! Think people will stay still? Someone wrote in to audit your show! What's got into you all of a sudden? You of all people! When are you going to break it off? In a rush? You saw my medical records. I want to keep playing. But I guess you don't have that luxury. Under one condition. Now, what. I'll tell you after I break it off. A promise is a promise. Since when was it no smoking in here. No idea. Our parents will be shocked. I should be really angry at a time like this, right? Yell at you or something? Funny, somehow I feel a little grateful. I'm going out for a smoke. So uncomfortable. My engagement's off. I don't have parents. I was studying late at high school in my senior year. My homeroom teacher came in and stared right at me. Like someone who came to take me on death row. Like in the movies, you know? Anyway, he told me to go to the hospital right away. When I asked why... if he said my parents and sister died in a car accident... then I wouldn't have gone and seen them like that. I see... K's been with me ever since. K? You saw him, Producer KANG Chul-kyu? His name sounds too corny so I just call him K. At home, he's my Mom At work, he's my Dad. When I'm sad, he's my brother. Sometimes he's like a lover. Though he always chickens out. Can I kiss you? You wanna kiss me? Stupid. Let me see. Oh, no. That's right, I'm stupid! Open the door. Are you okay? Don't look! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I was born to love you. Heaven sent me to love you. Cat Girl's 'lf I could live again' requested by ID: Little Mermaid. - You wrote this song, Cream? - Yes. Let's hear, 'lf I could live again'. (Did you eat?) (I'm almost done!) Yes, boss. Come to my office, now. Okay. Producer KANG! KANG! I heard everything. I'm going to speak with the boss, right now! How can he fire a genius like you! I'm not getting fired. Same difference. - You can't go like this! - I'm taking a break. Really? That's not what I heard. I'm going to the States to study for a while. Really? Guess there's no use going to the boss. Thank you for everything, Mr. KIM. - Anytime. - You too, Min-chul. Give him the demo tape, Min-chul. Producer CHOI! Hold on! Wait! Min-chul... It's a ballad. Write up a good song. What's marriage? Marriage? Marriage. - Marriage... - Wait! A toothbrush holder. What? There's only one holder, but many toothbrushes. What's that got to do with marriage? Being together as one like toothbrushes in a holder. Then I must be married, already. Stupid! You can't be married without a wedding. Really? I gotta pee. No one else but Thee. 'Thee' is a lucky person. Wanna hear it? EUN Won and I living together probably got to you. But there's nothing to worry about. I'm okay with that. I'm thankful for everything you did for her. Let's get together often. Go on trips together and stuff. Sounds good. She says she wants to pick out her wedding dress with you. Gotta love her wild ideas. Why me? I want what she wants. Please do it for her. And I hope it's the last thing you ever do for her. Sure. Please take good care of her. Of course. She's my woman, now. Let's drink. What do you think? Very pretty. It's time for the groom-to-be to try on his suit. I'm not the groom. Try it on. Come up here. Come here. Can you take a picture of us? On three. One, two, three! Wait out there. I'll try on something else. Why are all the clocks stopped? No reason. Can I turn one on? Why? No reason. No reason? Sure. Jenna? I have a big favor to ask. What is it? I need to send flowers on her anniversary for a few years. She'll get suspicious, if I lose touch altogether. I had one more condition. Remember? What is it? Please die at my side. You booked the tickets? I'm running low on battery. Hey. What are you making? My phone battery ran out. I'll charge it and call you back later. Bye. Hi. Why'd you leave me there like that? It's for you. Who do you think you are! What's with you? Who says you can touch my phone! The hell you... Who says you can do whatever you want with me! Can I help you? Is K home? K? Someone's here. She's pretty. I can see why you love her. You think she's happy? What are you saying? She didn't seem happy. Can you send this for the next 3 years? It's pretty. Maybe too pretty. It looks fake. Like your love. Then what's real? Real? If you're hungry, you eat. If you're hurting, you cry. If you're having fun, you laugh. Not hold it in like you. You really wanna die like this? No! I don't want to die like this. I want to live a happy life. I want to be the one marrying EUN Won... ...instead of him, tomorrow. But... That's just a dream. A sad dream. I'm done with dreaming. Sleep tight and sweet dreams. Did you eat? - Cream Thanks. I'm not talking to you. I'm sorry. For what? For everything. I'm sorry, too. For what? For everything. I love you... I like you. Me, too. That's some story. KANG... amazing guy. I had no idea. Is there anyway to reach them? What about the dentist? Wonder what happened to her. Let's record it. Really? I'll call right now. No, the other song. Oh, that song. I gotta go, I'm late. Get up and eat. I made breakfast. What's this? Ah, Vitamin ABC. It helps me get smarter. Where'd you get these pills? They're my friends' pills. Since when did your friend start taking this? Why? The pain must've been severe to take these pills. What? They're painkillers for patients with cancer or leukemia. Terminal patients. Have you heard of the hospice ward? It's where dying patients stay... with consent from their families. Mom! Watch the house while we're out. See you later, sis! No! When I found out what Vitamin ABC really was... When I finally realized what they were... When my whole world turned pitch dark before me... What's wrong? I died before K. I met K a year after my whole family passed away. Though almost 3 hours passed... he stood there frozen like stone. Crying and looking in the direction his mother went. This will be enough to support you till you're an adult, Chul-kyu. He looked sadder and more hurt than me. He needed a hug more than me. Is there anything you want to tell me? Like what? A deep, dark secret? Say anything. I'm ready to listen. I like you. Stupid idiot. Do you have a wish? What's with you? Just curious all of a sudden. If you could do anything you want in the world. K is dying. Meet a great guy and get married. Can't I marry you? I'm not a great guy. Then who is? Someone who is healthy and nice. Who knows how to take care of his family. I already met a great guy. But K told me to meet someone else. He said that was his wish. KANG Chul-kyu When I heard K fainted... I rushed over, afraid I'll go crazy. But I... ... couldn't even go crazy. No, doc. But she should know. What are you going to do? I don't know. It feels like a needle stuck in my throat. Right here. It gets stuck right here. I can't say it. She'll live on. Think of yourself. She's different. She needs someone beside her. - Hello. - There goes Mr. Perfect. Glowing from head to toe! I picked a man. Which side did you drink from? Pardon? I'm engaged. Stupid. You think I care whether you're engaged or not? Just play along and meet me. For K. Am I a bitch? I don't have time to worry about that! The man I love is dying! If I could be born again... A ring? A pair of glasses? A bed? A diary? Born again as things like that? What fun is that? You can buy me. It'll always be fun at your side. What's wrong? Are you okay? Let me see your hand. Where are you going? I made a deal with myself. If he turns around, I'd tell him everything. If he turns around, I'd hug him and stop everything. But K didn't look back. And there was nothing I could do. Why are you eating noodles instead of rice? Just wanted something simple. - It's good, huh? - Yeah. As I sat eating the noodles with him... I'd think, 'Don't die you bastard' and drank some water instead. 'Tell me. Let me hold you! I'll die with you! ' 'I'll follow you and pay you back for everything you did for me! ' Instead, I just drank the water. And finished the noodles. There's only one holder, but many toothbrushes. What's that got to do with marriage? Being together as one like toothbrushes in a holder. Then I must be married, already. Stupid! You can't be married without a wedding. Really? Can we get married, soon? Wait out there. I'll try on something else. The hell you... Who says you can do whatever you want with me! I'm sorry. I want to tell him I love him. I want to open my mouth and say I love him. But I knew tears will fall before I could say it. So I kept silent, again. When are you going to talk to me? Didn't you hear me screaming at you all this time? What? Stupid. I didn't hear anything. Then how can mutes love? I love you. Me, too. We became a real couple. Cuz we made it down the aisle. Heaven's Gate Resting Place Wait! You never learn! How can you write with a brain like that? This isn't kissing, is it? Can you take a picture of us? On three. One, two, three! I was born to love you. Heaven send me to love you. - EUN Won - I'm making noodles. Want some? No, I gotta work. You sure? Yes, I'm working! - Then I'm just making one! - Okay. Don't come beggin'later. - Hey! - What? No eggs! Give me that. Wonder who invented noodles. You said you didn't want any. Changed my mind. Is there any rice? Hold on. There's some in the fridge. Chul-kyu... I'm coming to you. Don't worry. I trust you. You were always my compass. Remember when I said I can see you even when you're not with me? Go wherever you want. I'll find you, soon. Don't get mad when you see me. Don't ask me why I followed you or get angry at me. After everything to come to you, if you get mad I'll cry. When we meet again on the other side, let's not cry again. Wait for me. I'll be right there.
