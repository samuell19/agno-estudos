PAULO BRANCO and JERZY SKOLIMOWSKI present a JERZY SKOLIMOWSKI film FOUR NIGHTS WITH ANNA What did you do at the river? Okrasa! You saw a dead cow floating by and heard a siren? Want your sleeping pill? Well, maybe yes... Leon, will you wind it up? Okrasa! Will you remember anything? You still got that hand? And the ring? There was a ring. No, there wasn't. The wife says there was. There wasn't. How can you bear this smell? Report immediately to chief. I hired you knowing about your imprisonment. I trusted you, believed in you... Don't you appreciate it? That man lost his hand. Think what it means to him to lose his wedding ring too. So, will you... return it? I didn't... steal it. Grandma! Snow! Grandma! I want to... report... that a woman... was raped... In the old kolkhoz. In the barn... My name? Okrasa! Good morning, your savings card, please? I was thinking about white wine. Manager, report to desk 2. You have the same brand in red? The white goes to your head faster. There it goes. Two bottles of red and two white ones, please. And cigarettes. Menthols. Two packs. Just like you wanted, grandma, I'm seeing a woman. I'm listening. So then I... Yes? Then I came closer. I'm listening... I mean, closer. And? Yes? And then I... saw... her red toenails. Yes? And then... Yes? Then I heard a siren. Then... I heard... a siren. Cigarette? Fine. So you're standing there and hearing a siren. Yes? What siren? An... ordinary one. You're saying, Okrasa, a dead cow was floating in the river, and then there was a siren. That's all? There was a siren! Calm down and try to remember. So? Calm down. Pick it up. Pick it up! Calm down. We'll start again. Sit down, Mr Okrasa. Not there, closer. Cigarette? Sign here, please. But what? Your quitting and severance pay. Nobody told you? We're closing the crematory. Next month. It wasn't my idea, Mr Okrasa. We can't afford it any longer. Our budget was cut. I didn't steal. I know that. A patient found that ring. He left it at home. I wanted to apologize but you know with all the work... You've been a good employee. And for the first time, I can really pay you. Take it, before I change my mind. Remember your signature. Thank you. That's all. These are real diamonds. I can find something cheaper... Happy birthday to you... You do not wish to defend yourself? Are you admitting your guilt? The Court finds the defendant guilty based on circumstantial evidence. The victim testified that she had not seen her aggressor's face and refused to testify for the Court in this case of rape. As a result, the confrontation with the defendant was unnecessary. The Court took under consideration the extenuating circumstances presented by the Defense, namely that the accused was an illegitimate child raised by an ailing grandmother. However, the evidence and lack of repentance... Oh God... No, thanks, I can't dance anymore... Good health, happiness, and success in your personal life. Darling... Thank you. Sleep Tochka, sleep... Don't forget that. And hurry up. It's already 9 o'clock. Leon, ducky, you're the cleaning lady tonight? Clean gets me excited, look. Got a hard-on already. Go ahead. Leon will understand. He's a rough rider himself. Tochka, you were supposed to take care of me... We'll get him tonight anyway. Stretcher, Quick, Coming, The IV! Where's the damn IV? Careful! You may sit down. Case number 6K9B/04/07. The Court resumes its hearing. The Court has examined all evidence presented by the parties. Does the Defense wish to make any additional statements? No, your honor. Prosecutor? We rest. Has the defendant decided to testify? Yes. The decision? Yes. The defendant will testify? Yes. The defendant testified that on several occasions he broke into the room of Anna P., in the nurse's lodgings adjacent to the hospital. Is this correct? Yes. You also testified that you spent four nights in the victim's room while she was asleep in her bed. Is this correct? Yes. Did you at any point, with any part of your body, engage in sexual activity with the victim? No. Did you, during any of these visits, steal any objects belonging to the victim? No. You testified that you removed a cuckoo clock from the victim's room. Do you confirm your testimony? Yes. Fine. Why did you remove the clock from the victim's room? To fix it. You confirm that in 2003, you were convicted and served a prison term for the rape of Anna P., the victim in the case currently under deliberation? Yes. You have consistently denied, here, and in previous proceedings, any involvement whatsoever in the rape of the victim. Do you uphold your testimony? Do I? In 2003, did you assault and rape Anna P? No. Then what was the reason for your breaking into the victim's room? Why did you break in four times into her room? Love. Louder, please. Love. "Romeo among us." "A citizen of our town, duped by overwhelming romantic feelings..." Hey, dude, did you really paint her toenails? What a freak! Take it. I don't need it. I will not come any more. I know it wasn't you who... But I will not come.
