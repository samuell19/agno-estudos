"Jesse James - Jesse James Tho' he was just a mean one. To me he was a friend ..." I don't know where he is! I don't know ... Ma! ... Ma! I don't know where he is! I don't know! Ma ... Shhh … Jesse, it's all right, honey. It's all right. You been dreamin' again, Jesse. When are you going to stop dreamin' that same dream, Jess? He beat me. He cut me to ribbons trying to make me tell where Frank was hiding with Quantrill. There was a war, then. A lot of people got hurt who shouldn’t have. He made it hard to forget. That Yankee soldier did! But you can't go on hating one dead man the rest of your life. I swore I'd kill him the same way he tried to kill me! I swore when they buried him he wouldn't have enough flesh on his dirty, stinking body to hold his bones together. And I kept my word. You kept your word and you've kept running and hiding ever since! You think I like living this way? And knowing that every day my chances for staying alive keep getting smaller and smaller. Jess, darling, don't talk anymore about it. I didn’t mean what I said before about running and hiding. I'm sorry. It's all right, honey. You only spoke the truth. What eats a man most is when he's gotta hide his own name from his own son! When he's too ashamed to let him know the truth! Jess, darling. Jess! He worships you! He'll grow up loving you, just like he does now. And someday, when he's old enough to know and understand, we'll tell him. When he's old enough to know and understand, that's when he'll begin to hate me! The light! Who is it? There's two of 'em. I can't see their faces. It's the place. They're coming to the door. If there's any shooting, take little Jess out the back way to the horses. You know where to go. I'll meet you there, somehow. Be careful, Jess. Jesse … Jesse! Jesse, are you there? Can you hear me? You got a wrong address, Mister. The name’s Tom Howard like it says on the mailbox. - Now move! - Jesse, it's me, Bob Ford. I don't know any Bob Ford. Now I said move! But I know it's you, Jesse. You and Zee and little Jess. You've got to believe it's me! I've been ridin' a long way to find you. - Who's with ya? - Friend of mine, Sam Wells. I wouldn't lie to you, Jesse. I wouldn't be crazy! You carrying a gun? Yeah, I got a gun, Jesse. The one you gave me, remember? I don't remember anything. Now listen to me, I'm gonna open this door and when I do throw that gun in on the floor where I can see it. Then when I tell ya, come in with your hands stretched out in front of you. And if you're lyin' I'll kill ya. Both of you! All right, come in like I said. That’s far enough. Now turn around. - Bob, it's been a long time. - A long time, Jesse. It's all right, Zee. It's Bob Ford. You hear me, honey? I said it's Bob Ford. Yes Jess, I hear you. Will you make us some coffee to bring in, honey? - This is Sam Wells. - Glad knowing you. Looks like this kind of turned out to be a good luck piece you gave me. You took a lot of convincing. For a couple of minutes, I was worried, maybe you turned unfriendly. Man like me has got to be choosy who his friends are. Especially in the middle of the night. I get kinda nervous when I hear someone call me by my real name. I think maybe Sam and me could help put a stop to that. Interested? Good old Home Sweet Home. Jesse James ... family man. Who'd ever have believed it. Relax, Sam. You say you came a long ways? Colorado. Place called Creede, up in the Sam Juan district, along the Rio Grande. I hear that's pretty hot mining country. Hottest mining pay dirt in the whole United States. I always wondered why you headed after that railroad job at Blue Cut. That's the time Frank and I almost got it. They had Pinkerton men and posses riding our tails all through Missouri. How did you know where to find me? My brother Charlie ran into Cole Younger. He said you were living here in St. Jo., using the name Tom Howard. You said it was important, how important? Maybe, eh, three hundred thousand dollars important? All in gold? Hello, Zee. This is Sam Wells ... my wife. Pleased knowing you, Missus. Around St. Jo it's Howard. Even among old friends, gives us a more comfortable feeling. Yes … sure, uh, glad knowing ya, ma'am. - Thanks. - Go to bed, honey. You must be tired. Try and get some sleep. Goodnight. Goodnight. Three hundred thousand dollars. That's a lot of gold. There's lots of gold where that comes from. Sam knows. This is a chance to play the prettiest serenade that was ever heard in the West, Jesse. The Big Bob Mine. Richest diggings around. They store the gold. Once a month Wells Fargo picks up the shipment and hauls it to the mint at Denver. There's never less than two - three hundred thousand dollars. Sometimes, even more. Walking into a bank, or fixing a train is one thing but they must have an army guarding this 24 hours a day! Sam has it all figured. We get to the shipment before Wells Fargo. I know how to drop it right in our laps! He used to be the foreman at the Big Bob. I was there when old Pete White hit silver. A flash lode, got worked out fast. Pete went busted. Tried to sell his claim. Everybody called it Pete White's elephant. Everybody but Big Bob Williams. He had a hunch about there being gold. He bought Pete's claim for a couple of hundred dollars, then struck a vein that spread out over half the other side of the mountain. Williams put me back on working for him. And now? I've been away on a vacation a little bit, Colorado State Penitentiary. I got some gold dust in my eyes and I couldn't see too well what I was doing. They trip you for high-grading? You didn't get saddle-sore all the way from Colorado just because you're charitable ... just because you want to make a present of some of that gold. No. I've got a place in Creede, Jesse. Dance Hall, drinks dice, it's good business They come down from the hills heavy with yellow. A lot of that yellow rubs off on me. But one day there's not going to be any more dirt. The town will dry up and die like others have died. Well I'm not dying with it, I'm getting mine now. Sam too, there'll be no more penny ante high grading ore. You didn't answer my question. Why pick me? Because you can get the best men for the job. The ones who'll stay with it, take chances. Who won't slobber all over themselves or spit up their guts if anything goes wrong. Who'll keep their mouths shut in case we don't all break away clean! That kind of men will ride with you, Jesse, and nobody else. And you know where to find them. Twenty-five percent, just for your cut. One quarter of the take. That's enough for you, your wife and kid to stay lost anyplace you want. Mexico, South America … anyplace. I don't know. How much longer do you think you'll last here? They've got these decorating every state east of Colorado, Jesse. Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa. Ten Thousand Dollars is a lot of blood money, Jesse. There are lots of greedy people. Ten thousand's enough to buy one of them, who'll turn you in or put a bullet in your back, without even blinking. Just as sure as you're standing there, Jesse, someday someone will. - How many men do you need? - Three, not counting us. A teamster, a gunslinger and somebody to handle dynamite. Then what? Suppose we keep some secrets from each other, shall we? I never did like secrets. We do. Like where the gold is stored and how to get to it. You bring us the men, then we'll tell you all our secrets. Colorado's a long way to go just on promises. A man likes to know what he's getting into. What his chances are for coming out alive. You speaking for yourself or Tom Howard? You shouldn't talk like that, Bob. Maybe next time my guns might not be on the wall! I know. Why'd you think I said it? I'll let you know in the morning. You can pull up a couple of chairs and spend the night here. The fire will keep you warm. There's some room in the barn for your horses. Better get them in out of the rain. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Well? What do you think? - He'll come along. You can bet on it. It's just as good as gold. Come on, let's get those horses in. I know what they said, Jess. I had to listen. I would've told you. Bob Ford is no good! Send them away, Jess. Send them away now! What if a man knows it's all wrong, but wants to live like a human being? Tell them to go away, please tell them! What if I do tell them, Zee? If I don't go, what then? What more have we got to show? One less killing they'll want you for, one less robbery. Don't you see, Jess? If you don't stir up anything new, maybe they'll forget it. Stop looking for you. Leave you alone. Sure. Sure, they'll leave me alone, when I'm good and dead! That will probably be the day I go to bed without a gun under my head for a pillow. Then maybe I can sleep and stop dreaming dreams. Thank you. - Don't go, Jess. Don't! - It will be all right, honey. I've never asked you not to before but I'm begging you, Jess. Don't ask me, Zee. Don't make me say no to you. I have to go. I can't turn my back on this chance for our freedom. Come back to me alive. That's all I ask. I'll come back ... alive. After that, no more worries. No more going away. Every day, I'll pray for that. - Jess ... - Yes? I ... Oh, dear, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to burst in here like that but I saw two strange men coming out of the barn with horses so I come right over, wondering if there was anything wrong, or anything. Takin' another of your travelin' trips, Mr. Howard? - Yes, Mrs. Lovett. - Gone long. As long as it takes me to get back, Mrs. Lovett. Now don't you worry about a thing. She and the boy have their needs, I don't live that far. One good holler and I'll be right here. - You just remember that, honey. - I'll remember. Thanks for your kindness, Mrs. Lovett. You ready, Tom? Thanks, Ma'am, for your hospitality. Bye, I’ll be seeing you again sometime, Mrs. ... Howard. - Meet you in Creede. - Good luck. Let's get going. The key. You had no cause to shoot him! You see him, a rotten hunchback, full of poison bad luck. Come on, before I feel sorry I found you. Well don't talk that way, Jesse. I didn't mean no real harm. Cards, Mr. Hobbs? Mind this, my love. Now if that doesn't change my luck, I suppose I'll have to give up my evil, sinful ways and go back to the good, clean living. Liquor and women! A terrible sin, how they sicken a man's faith. And now … cards, Mr. Hobbs? Give me time, Sonny. Give me time. I'll just tag along with these. Well ... seems like you've got your faith back in a hurry, Mr. Hobbs. I'll take a swallow to that. Put your trust in Elias Hobbs, my fair ones. I win this hand, we toss a hairy-do the likes of which this slop bucket town has never seen. I’ll … eh … take two. Take away, Sonny. Take away. I'll just set this in here on account of maybe it won't get too lonesome. It should be worth about a thousand. You lose me. That's a real charitable bet, Mr. Hobbs. You know, I'd be most ungrateful not to call it. But so, what you've got left there shouldn't die of loneliness. I'll sweeten things another thousand. I'd rather die lonely than broke. You're not losing your faith again so soon, Mr. Hobbs? Now, you're putting the wicked seeds of doubt in my mind Sonny. As for me, I'd rather die dead broke than live a lonely man. Let's see what I've got to beat. Just two little pair ... of deuces. No sense of even showin' mine. Well … another stake, another day. Too bad. Like you say, another stake, another day. You ... uh ... wouldn't deny a thirsty man his last drink, would you? You low-down, cheatin' ... Both your hands on the table, Mr. Hobbs! You're shufflin' the deck, Sonny. See if he's carrying anything more on him. Dingus! 'For there will be no future to the evil man the lamp of the wicked shall be put out' So be it! An old saying of the ancient, wise men. May your filthy soul rest in peace. You took a lot of finding, Elias. We better get out of here before the whole place falls in on us! I'm glad to see you, boy. I told you my luck would change, sweetheart. That's for cheatin' honest, God-fearin' men! Wait … I don't like it. It's too quiet and Pat not being in the house. Only that Jay came flyin' through the window. A bad sign, a bird in the house. Means somebody's dead. Enough of your witchcraft talk, Brother Arch. Only gives the Devil bad ideas! Stand where you are, Mister. You too. Nobody's smokin' me off this land. Now turn around and get out of here. Just a minute, we're not tryin' to ... You're wastin' a lifetime, Mister. I'm looking for Pat Jorette. You came late. He's dead. How did it happen? You're lookin' right at it. I cut him down and buried him this morning. - You must be Johnny! - Yeah. I'm an old friend of your father's. I don't care who you are. I'm sayin' it for the last time. Now get out of here! Now, cool down, Sonny. Pat Jorette was no stranger to us. We all done a' lot of ridin' together. You've got to believe me, Johnny. Sure, same as they believed him when they put a rope around his neck. Company, Dingus. Johnny, those men riding up, are they ... I know who you are now. When my father used to talk about you, he always called you 'Dingus'. They ain't nobody gonna call anybody nothin' if we just figure on standin' here makin' conversation. They said they'd be back. Let 'em. All right, Jorrette, your time's up! Come on out peaceable and there'll be no trouble. That goes for whoever's in there with you. Now, that's what I call bein' real neighborly! Get back for some more men! You two keep Harvey covered! Must be going for help. He that helpeth shall stumble. 'And he that is helped shall fall!' Oh, I missed him! The wormy fat-bellied pig! Easy. Easy, easy girl. Easy. Jesse! She can get us out of here! What do you mean? I'll hitch her to the wagon and ride us out. She's fast and strong, she'll get us out. Brother Arch, here, can shoot as good from the hack of a wagon as anyplace. Let's go! Get back, boy. Come on! I'll open the doors and we'll come out shooting! Ready? Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! The horses get watered and settled? Yeah, Johnny took care of'em. He's sittin' out his watch. What about the boy, Dingus? You figurin' on takin' him with us? I hadn't thought. We still need someone to drive wagon. I was thinkin' about Clell Miller. Clell? Forget thinkin' about him. He went and got himself married. Woke up one Sunday morning found out he was hitched to a regular Church-goin', psalm-singing choir thrust. Got so reformed, she talked him into singin' in the tenor section. - What about Johnny Reno? - What about Johnny Jorrette? The way we come riding out of that barn for a minute I could'a swore it was his father Pat handlin' them reins. Ahh, the kid's still clean, Elias. Why dirty him up? A lot of things can happen. He's sittin' up there feelin' lost … scared … lonely! You ask me, Elias, sometimes it's a lost, scared and lonely world we're all tryin' to live in. Yeah, I guess sometimes it is. It ain't how they bring you in or carry you out that matters. It's what you do while you're here they remember you by. Like how they'll remember the kid, if we let him go back, Dingus. You're a cross, Elias, between a fox and an old goat. What do you see out there, Johnny? Yesterday or tomorrow? I still see them whipping that horse out from under my father. Letting him hang there ... to his own rope, his own rafter. Waiting to make sure his face turned black, then sayin' to me, 'go dig a grave and throw him in it!' That's what I see, that's what I hear, Until I pay 'em all back the same way. I know. Why'd they try to run you out? They tried to make him out a horse-thief. What chance did I have? Pat was a lot of things, Johnny, but not that. Next to livin' for you, why I think he loved horses most. Well, he found this bay, must've stumbled thru the fence during the night. I was laying there in the field, a broken leg and Pa tried to find out the owner, but he couldn't. He didn't have the heart to shoot him. So he got him back to the barn, and went to work settin' on his leg. And he cried real tears for the pain that bay felt. But he saved the leg. Then they came and swore Pa stole the horse! The same bay they put him on and whipped, when they rode him off the saddle! It all happened the day you showed. Well, we're pushing over the mountains for Colorado in the morning. Thanks, I've got unfinished business back the other way. You never finish that business, Johnny. You start to fight one and end up fighting them all. You never win. Well who's supposed to win? The liars? The cheaters? Pat's dead, Johnny, you can't help him anymore. What do you prove getting yourself killed? I don't think Pat would have liked it that way. I'm still short a man for this little hurrah. Are ya? Well, not anymore, you’re not! My poor innards are so shriveled and dried, my soul is about turned to dust. I trust the good Brother Robert has got all the proper remedies to soothe a man's aching needs? Sober and out of trouble this time, Elias, remember! 'He could be hateful, he could be serene. He could be tall or small, or fat or lean. If he will love me when I am mean. That's the man for me. He can be young, I don't care if he's old. He can be warm, I don't care if he's cold. Don't mind if he's a little bit bold. That's the man for me. He'll find me ready, lovable and steady. If he can make my dreams come true. I've been in love before brother, I know the score. And only one kind will do. He may be good or then he may be bad. He might make me happy, maybe make me sad. But if he'll make me love him like mad. That's the man for me'. (Applause) - Nice song. - Thanks. You cry your heart out like that for all men? Not all men. Excuse me, Miss, you know if Bob Ford's around? He might be. Tell him he's got visitors. Tom Howard and three friends. Tom Howard, and three friends. I'll tell him. All right, now, fellas just as soon as that bevy of gorgeous girls change their costumes, they're coming back and do another number for you. But in the meantime I've got a few gadgets here that I wanna show ya. And now, fellas, I'm gonna tell ya what I'm gonna do for you. I'm not only gonna give ya, for five dollars, this miner's panning pan, but I'm gonna give you absolutely free of charge. Now you think, my friends, we’re crazy when they call me crazy, I'll show ya that I'm teched in the head. I'm gonna give you as well as that miner's panning pan, I'm gonna give you that little divining rod. Now you know what this is for. I'll explain it. Gimme some o' that prairie poison you're hidin' back there, friend. Hold that over the ground. And that little divining rod will detect the slightest little trace of gold. - Ah! - A man in California, not long ago, made exactly a million dollars when he discovered ... Go ahead, take it, boys. Can't hurt you any more than gettin' cozy ideas about that girl. Her kind has got more dynamite capped inside her, than a stick of giant Dan sizzlin' up a fast fuse. You stick to handling the dynamite and I'll try to keep the horses gentled. Just handing out a little welfarin' advice, that's all. Dingus? Elias, you know I've never had a drink in my life. Welcome to Creede. How was the trip. We're here, Arch Clements, Johnny Jorrette, Elias Hobbs. Good brother Robert. - And your friend, Mr. Ford? - The name's Kate. A very personal friend, Jorrette. I'll try to remember that. Oh,speaking of friends, how's Sam? I'm kinda anxious to see him again, pick up where we left off. Sam's fine. He's been keeping everything nice and warm until you got here. Let's go back in my office and talk. If you don’t mind let's talk out here. More sociable out here in the open. You don't have anything to worry about here. I just like to make sure. Move around the tables, and keep the sucker boys happy. Helps dry their losing tears. Why not? It's all part of making a living. Nice meeting you all. That's no way to say goodbye. When I wanna meet someone for the second time, I let 'em know. Music! Music! Go ahead! Now take it easy, there. And now you're going to see the gorgeous girls performing the latest dance, crazy from Gay Paree, France. I said once, I wanted no trouble. Now keep peace, both of you! Or get out now! Sorry. I didn't mean no real harm, Jesse. Your saying that's getting to be a bad habit with you, Arch. Now get rid of it! You'll have to excuse him, Miss. He's not very bright sometimes. I know the type. There's two things a man's got an everlasting greed on for one's a woman, the other's gold! Bad as a dog tryin' to catch his own tail. Come on, Johnny brother Arch, swallow down your bitterness. We can't all start hatin' one another too soon. Some boys you've got. My boys are all right. They know their job! That Jorrette kid looks wet behind the ears. You know I can smell a trigger-happy gunslinger. He gets queer ideas, but he's the best there is. I can handle him. Now let's get back to Sam. He's shacked out in the hills, up at the mine. That way nobody sees him, nobody wonders what he's doing back here. We head out that way at sunup tomorrow. But you and your boys must be tired. Be my guest. There are rooms upstairs, anything you want, the place is yours. Well now, that's real generous. Missouri's a long way from Colorado. I just don't like to think of you getting homesick. We're partners now, one big happy family. Boys, everything's on the house. Enjoy yourselves. You are a good man, Brother Robert. He that gives to the poor, shall not lack for himself. Exactly my sentiments, rooms are upstairs. Be ready at sunup tomorrow morning. Dingus, you get a feelin' Brother Robert is dreamin' up fancy ideas of his own? Why? What do you mean? I dunno, all these free drinks an' them lovely dancin' ladies, like a fatted calf before the kill. My nose smells somethin' burning. Same smell I had the day we rode into Northfield and got all chopped up. Ford wants a piece of that gold the same as we do. He's not going to do anything to hurt his chances. Not his, maybe ... And nothing and no one is going to hurt ours! I've got my whole life riding on this one. I know, Dingus, I know. You got my life, too, going on it. Thanks, Elias. You're a good friend. I think I'll try and get some sleep. Go ahead, Dingus, don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right. Johnny, take care of the horses. Keep away from that girl! Keep close by to him. Keep an eye open. See no one goes near his room or her! An' that goes for you, too, if you don't want to get your pants full of buckshot. Might be worth it! Glad to see you again. I brought you the men you asked for. Your gunslinger, driver and powder man. Arch Clements, Johnny Jorette, Elias Hobbs. - Everything set? - I'm ready. Well, let's not waste time. It was right in this room old Pete White blew his brains out when they told him Bib Bob hit gold on the other side of the mountain. We said you bring the men, we keep no secrets. A man dies like that leaves a curse behind him. I can see the signs all around. What signs? Signs ... Shut your devil's mouth, Brother Arch, and swallow all your mother o' witch talk! 'There shall no curse torment the righteous, no fear the unafraid'. You started saying there'd be no secrets. Here's the entrance to the old mine, about four hundred yards from here at the foot of the rocks. Pete's lode was a deep one, ran way down into the mountain. Then we struck a fault, about here. There's river runs underground and feeds into the Rio Grande. We tried blasting around it. The whole section collapsed, the river broke through. Nobody got out. I was working an upper level. We shored up the section, blocked it off, then started working off here. We might as well have been digging for worms in that rock. That vein hit dirt and stayed there. Pete couldn't lick it. That's when Williams bought in. He closed up this end of the mine, opened a new entrance on the opposite side of the mountain. Here. That's when Big Bob's gold hunch paid off. They forgot one little thing, Pete's old tunnel! It runs right below! We blast through that fault, we'll be sitting there, lookin' up at 300,000 dollars worth of yellow! You sure? Like I was born and raised in that tunnel, that's how sure. May be tricky but it can work. How tricky? You brought a good powder man, nothing to worry about. There ain't nothing that Big Dan can't handle if you treat him gentle enough. All right, we get the gold, then what? I'll be here the day before with a team and wagon. The stuff will be too heavy to hand carry on our horses. That'll be your job, Jorette, drivin' those horses. We use an old stagecoach trail, runs between Del Norte and Silverton. I'll ride point. Your gunslinger covers us. Jesse, you and him will ride both sides of the wagon. Sam will ride in the wagon with the gold to make sure it stays lashed down There's an old way station about half-way. We stop there and split up the gold. After that, every man is on his own! I never tell my men what to do. If they like the setup they go, if they don't they forget about it. It's up to them. Just be there with the team and wagon. In that case, Mr. Ford, you better get up to riding point in a hurry. I get real jumpy over anybody ridin' behind me. Thanks, I'll remember. Well, Jesse, I guess your boys have given their answer. Yeah, I guess they have. That's settled. Let's open up that tunnel. There's part of the mountain washed down and sealed up the entrance. What about the sound of the explosion? It won't carry over the mountain. Big Dan, looks like you an' me have gotta go to work. Get clear, I'm lighting the string! Let it blow! Quite a noise, eh, Dingus? Reminds me of the time we were ridin' with old Charley Quantrill. the day we blew that bridge under them blue bellies chasin' us out of Centralis. Arms and legs flyin' all over the place. What a day! Yeah! What a day! Ha-ha-ha. Quiet and peaceful like. Dry as a bone. No air comin' in here. I've seen caves at home in Kentucky like this. They make for nice tombs. Here's the spot we hit the fault. We blast through it, dig our way right under the gold cave. How long? Oh, if we don't run into any trouble, about three days. Well, I'll be headin' back to town. You better pick a salty, long harness team for this ride. Don't lose any sleep, Jorrette over my pickin' horses. I'm the one that's gonna do the driving, Mr. Ford, remember? We'll see you back here in a couple of days, Bob. We'll handle it in here, Arch, you watch the scenery outside. We'll be needin' every man in the tunnel, Jesse. I feel more comfortable with Arch outside. - Good luck. - Be seein' ya. Good Brother Robert, I can still hear the echo of my great grandfather's voice when I was a child giving me this advice for when I was to grow up, 'Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake.' That's how he put it. You, uh, don't suppose you could return with those priceless words of wisdom in a bottle, do you, heh? Good Brother Roberts? Well, that's what I thought. Oh, well ... We'll need all the equipment from the shack. I'll get it. Gold within our reach, and yet what comfort is it to a parched and thirsty spirit. Dingus! Dingus! Cave-in! Dingus! Cave-in! Dingus! Here, Dingus! Here! Elias! Dingus! - Ah. - There. - All right. - Ah. There, that did it. Oh! For a couple of minutes there I thought I was gonna be missing at my own wake. That would have been a terrible disappointment. - Are you sure you're all right? - Ahh … Sure. Let's go. Wait out here! I didn't expect to be meetin' you so soon again for the second time. Funny place to bring a woman. Especially you! Things must be uh, kinda slow back in Creede. What happened? Did you lose your voice? You rotten, low-down, wormy piece of muck! You need a good teachin'! Aaaaah! Aaaah! What'd you bring her for? Take her to the cabin! If she's not all right, I'll kill you. What happened? She slipped near the edge and fell. I tried to get to her, lost my balance and we both went over. You sure that's the way it happened, Arch? Sure I'm sure, Jesse. Hello … Johnny. Well now, that's real touching. Forget It! It's not the kid's fault, nor hers. But she stays here, alone. Find yourselves a place to sleep outside. We've got a big day tomorrow. Sure you didn't lie to me, Arch? It's just like I said, Jesse. I slipped and fell, it was an accident. I guess it was a mistake, my comin' here. But then, what's one more mistake in a lifetime. I never was one to do things the easy way. It isn't my nature. Well, here's luck to both of us! - And thanks. - Thanks for what? For keeping our friend Mr. Ford from climbing all over Johnny. He's a nice kid. I hope he stays that way. You sure you're all right? I said I was all right! I ought to know. Yeah, I guess you ought to. Jorette ... get these horses rubbed down and fed. Why these don't look like no 'salty' horses to me. - They'll tire fast. - They're the best I could get! Shut up, all of you! Everyone's getting too jumpy around here. We've got too much riding to do tomorrow to start cutting each other's throats now. I want to check the tunnel, just to be sure. I'll go with you, Sam. Now let's keep it peaceful. How is she, Jesse? She thinks you're a nice kid. She wants you to keep your nose clean. Don't let it go to your head. Forget it! Forget her. She's not for you. - She tell you that, too? - Take my word for it, Johnny. What do you think? Ain't no sense worryin' ahead of time, Dingus. Anything goin' to happen, it won't be 'til after everyone gets to see the color of that gold. If Brother Robert's been buildin' a fire under us, it won't start burnin' our bottoms 'til then. And … uh, Sam? Ah, poor Sam, he's been tastin' this stuff for breakfast, lunch and supper. Things had better work out, I can't stand another day of drinkin' water! I never figured the girl, Bob. I don't like it. Suppose you let her be on my conscience. I've got my reasons. How about you, you all set? We're right under it. Brother Elias figures there'll be no trouble. Good. Well? It's all arranged. They'll be here. They'll take care of the gunslinger first, while we're still inside the tunnel. The minute everyone's in the open, they get it. They'll never even know what hit 'em. You sure you can trust them? Sam, if the law wanted you for murder, and I showed you a way to get the law to forget about you, you'd be safe and sure as money in a bank, wouldn't you? - Yeah ... - That's right, Sam. I traded Jesse in. He's worth a big fat pardon to each one of those boys outside. Besides, they get to split the ten thousand reward. Yeah ... I remember you told him ten thousand was a lot of blood money. That it would buy somebody someday. You've got a good memory, Sam. That's not all, I figured you'd get Jesse, you'd try to get me, too. That was stupid of you, Sam. I yelled, but he couldn't get out from under it in time. Maybe you didn't yell loud enough. - How're you comin', Elias? - Patience, Dingus, patience. This reminds me of the time we were fixin' to blow the tracks under the Little Rock Express. You and your brother Frank hurried me so to get it done by eight. We caught the morning train, but got nothin' but a few passenger pickin's. What we was really after was the eight o'clock evenin' train that was haulin' seventy five thousand. There, that does it, give me them sticks. Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah! Guns. An unhappy man, Brother Arch. Nothin' but evil in him. Probably the kindest thing he ever done in his whole life. Comin' in here to tell us. Somebody must've found out somehow and followed me. Maybe Sam made a deal. - Too bad nobody can ask him. - Shut up, you. Cut it, Johnny, cut it. She's right. You probably framed this whole thing. - Hold on, Brother Roberts. - Go ahead, Jesse, ask him. You do your asking some other time. If the boys outside are after the gold they get us first. If they're not they get us anyway. Either way, we're buzzard bait. We'll shoot our way out. You won't live to pull the trigger. If I know the set-up, they're sitting out there, waiting to blow our heads off the minute we show. Maybe not, Dingus. Maybe we get our chance to blow our way out of here first. That is, if Brother Sam had a good memory. Accordin' to this, uh, map here, we're pretty close to that upper level. If he could get out of the mine that way, so can we. What about the gold? We'll find a way out first, then we'll worry about the gold. You mean you're going to walk away from a fortune? What good is it to a dead man! Ha-ha-ha. Only brother Arch. He's got a whole mountain of gold for a coffin. Ha-ha-ha. Too bad he won't never know how lucky he is. Come on, Elias, find the place and get us out of here. Yeah, sure hope Brother Sam had a good memory. Right up there ahead. Uh-uh, Dingus. I'm the only one to handle this serenade. You all right? Funny how you sometimes meet the nice ones at the wrong time. She's burnin’ … hold on. - Elias! - The river! Come on. Look out! Whoa. Well ... in another hour you'll be Tom Howard back in Saint Jo again. You know, we could'a got that gold, and still made it out of there somehow. What difference does it make now, anyway? Someday one of us will pick up a paper and read how somebody put a bullet in the back of one of our heads. It’s got to happen that way, I suppose You better get hold of yourself, Jesse. You're just asking for it. Where you heading? My brother Charlie's place, I guess. It’s the only place I've got left to go now. They'll be huntin' me just the same as you. Well ... So long, Bob. Give my regards to Zee! Be seein' you sometimes, Jesse. "'Twas a dirty little coward That shot Mr. Howard, and laid poor Jesse James in his grave But in a barroom someone spotted Bob Ford and there he got it. The way poor Jesse James went to his grave."
