[Dog barks] Whoa. [In Greek] [In Greek] [Sings in Greek] [Birds chirp] [Donkey brays] [Birds sing] [Bell tolls] [Rooster crows] [Donkey brays] [In Greek] [In Greek] [Soula responds in Greek] [Sighs] [In Greek] [In English] End of an era. No more feta cheese in your shop. [In English] I believe in progress. You believe in preservation. Jumbos! With the new airport, I can make a lot of money. Then, maybe this place will look as nice to me as it does to you. I hope you make a lot of money. [Woman speaking] [In Greek] [Crying] [In Greek] Yanni. [Penelope speaking] [Sighs] [In English] A monument. [Birds sing] [Rooster crows] [Katherine in Greek] [Donkey brays] [In English] What's wrong, mama? [In English] Money. It's always money. Your book! Oh, it's beautiful! I don't care if it's been in your museum for 100 years. That little torso can't be 5th-century. Look at his pectorals. Pectorals like that are a typically 4th-century development. Is the car here? If you think my article is scathing, come along to one of my lectures. Goodbye, Edward. Myles has got flu. Roberton's got flu. Even spender's caved in. Which makes you, Mr. Lamb, the lucky winner of the office raffle. Rhodes! The colossus of rhodes? One of the wonders of the world? Well, that's where you're going. A lovely little village called lindos. Charter flight, confirmed reservation at hotel Poseidon, Mr. and Mrs. Lamb. Is that clear? Yes, sir, very good, sir. What am I going to do, sir? Do as you're told. We may have a little item we want to export to Turkey, lamb. Till then, just lie in the sun and wait for instructions. Okay? Yes, sir. By the way, it says in your file that you know something about guns. Is that correct? You do know which end the bullet comes out of? Oh, yes. Yes, sir. Oh, what should I tell my wife, sir? Come on, lamb! Tell her it's a 2nd honeymoon! Ah! Watch it! [Sighs heavily] Don't know what the score is? England never plays so well away. Makes no difference when the whole of england's on holiday. No wonder the economy's a mess. Aren't you on holiday, then? Enjoy it, mate. It only comes once a year. Mr. Lamb, I am very sorry. No rooms. No rooms? What do you mean, no rooms? We've got a bloody booking, haven't we? Booking, yes, rooms, no. [Benny] Here we are. All right? Hello, Mick. There you are, all right? Benny, pleased to meet you. Benny, all right. Anybody want any suntan oil rubbing in, eh? [Donkey brays] I wish you still sold feta cheese. And olive oil. Thank you. If your mother signs these, I can raise the price. Ban the bomb! Ban the bomb! Ban the bomb! Hold on. Chloe! Sharpie! Chloe, I can't pick them up, help me! Hey, June, check this out! A single-breasted bikini! Beauty! This is a mistake. That's great, yanni. I'll buy that! Is it half price? We'll take 6. 6 singles! With studs. We want studs! Studs? Green, blue... Of course, along the edge. Yeah! [Toilet flushes] Aristotle: Good. Katherine: No! No! No! No! Aristotle! 15 years, you've been trying to fix this and it wouldn't drown a flea! Niagara! Niagara Falls! Whoosh! Whoosh! Mummy, I've got a surprise for you. What? What is it? Come and look. Oh, sharpie. Yes. How wonderful to see you. Oh! Oh, wonderful to see you. Sharpie? Hmm? Oh, Chloe. What a paradise! [Sighs] I think I could sit here forever. I think mummy's upset about something. Really? Yes, she's always fussing around the house. She worries about money and stuff. She cries at sunset. Cries at sunset? Do you know that I still don't know what school I'm going to go to next year? I wish I knew what was going to happen. Oh, my dear, thinking about the future is a modern vice. Opisthiawas a much healthier attitude. What's opisthia? Well, imagine that life's a road, or rather, suppose it's a river and we're all rowing along in our little boats with our backs to where we're going. Then, what we're looking at, what's stretching in front of US, is the past, isn't it? The future's always behind US. That's what opisthiais about. So you mean, like standing backwards on an escalator. [Laughs] Yes. How's your father doing? He's fine. Are they on speaking terms at the moment? Of course not. They're still quarrelling about art. This time, it's about a statue he's making for yanni. I think you should marry mummy. You're the only man she doesn't quarrel with. Chloe, can you go and get the coffee, please? Sharp: Oh, there you are. Mummy, you're always interrupting. Sharp: Thank you. You look stunning. Oh. [Sighs] Do you remember the pot? Hmm. You gave it to me years ago. It's rather charming, isn't it? I'd forgotten. Sharpie, I know that one is not supposed to sell presents, but would you mind very much if I did? Of course not, it's yours. But I don't think you'll get very much for it. Well... There's a New York dealer who thinks it might be worth quite a lot. I doubt that. I'm broke, sharpie. I think I'm going to have to sell the house. Sell the house? That serious? Yup. And I can't bear to tell Chloe. It's our last summer here. Katherine, what's happened? Oh, you know, too many debts. My train de vie, I suppose. And my book isn't selling. The light of Greece? Mm-hmm. But it's a big success. It's in every bookshop! Exactly. No one's buying it. I can't believe you told me this is a 2nd honeymoon and we haven't even got a place to stay! Ow! I said it's not my fault, Carol. It's only till tomorrow. We'll find a room tomorrow! Yes, but what about tonight? It's a funny kind of holiday to win. More like a booby prize. All right, that's it! Ow! 5 hours searching for a bloody room, and all you do is lie here moaning about your foot. I've had it! That hurt! Girl: Hey, let's check out the rocks. Yeah. We can live with the goats. Leave her alone, that must be painful. What are you looking at? Ow! Oh, Rick, I'm sorry. It's just that... I don't know, I feel ever so funny. I'm starving. I want some taramasalata. Come on. Hurry up, will you? Ooh. Don't put your weight on it. How else can I walk with no weight on my heel? Sharp: If we get married, you could have half my house in London. You wouldn't need a flat. Plus, there's my pension when I croak. And my art collection. [Sighs] If only life was so simple. Oh, look at the light. Rick: Excuse me, i-I'm so sorry to bother you. I wondered if you knew somewhere where we could stay? See, we can't find a room, and the thing is, my wife's a cripple. Have you tried the Neptune? Everywhere is full up. We can't even hire a sleeping bag. Well, um, you know, if you hurry, you might get the last bus back to rhodes. Oh, no, Rick, not the bus! My poor girl, what happened? Oh, sea urchins. The best cure for that, my dear, is ammonia. Urine's quite effective. Someone mentioned something about yanni renting rooms. Oh, Penelope wouldn't go for that. Oh, w-who's yanni? Lord Byron. [Bell chimes] Come on. Come on, darling. We'll get a room. All right? We'd better stick with them. Sharpie, the time is right and the light is perfect. I'd like to get that shot on the hill. Okay, see you later. Okay, anybody want to come along? You come with me. It's easier this way. Take that, Carol. Where are you going? I'll go with her. She might... Rick! I'll see you down there, all right? Where's your luggage? She took the other way, with your mate. I meant, your bags. Oh, them. They're at, uh, they're at the Poseidon. Which hotel are you in, then? Well, I have a house. Oh, nice! What, a big house? [Goat bleats] Come on. Who's, um, who's the old guy with the Panama, then? He's an art historian. Oh, I thought he was inland revenue. Inland what? Uh, civil servant, you know, like me. Are you a tax collector? Ah, well, I'm an actor, really. I mean, you know, at heart, I'm an actor. [Seagulls squawk] This is one of my favorite views. Rick: Oh, yes, nice, nice. [Donkey brays] Yeah, well, it's, uh, certainly what I'd call a view. To the unknown tourist. Uh, my name is Rick lamb. Girl: Beauty, Jenny. I'll take those green shoes when I've had him. Rick! Where have you been? Sorry, we got a bit involved with the view. Mr. Sharp's gone on ahead. Oh, thank you. Penelope! [In Greek] [In Greek] [Katherine in Greek] [In English] Purple dawn. [In Greek] [In English] She wants to know if you're noisy. [Laughs] Well, normale. [In English] Right, how many...What do you want, rent...Drachmas for room? [In Greek] [Carol, in English] What did she say, Rick? Well, it's all Greek to me. Oh, look at these creases! You got to press this, Carol. Carol: Oh, here, give it to me, darling. Carol! You don't need this jacket, Rick. We're on holiday! Bloody fig leaf! Come and get it. [Laughs] Oh, no, Rick, don't tickle! You know it makes me go funny. [Carol laughs] Rick, I want it to be so romantic. Our first night in Greece. Dining in a taverna. [Goat bleats] Oh, hello, um, are you yanni? I'm yanni. I've, um, come about the rent. Your mother, she won't take any rent. My mother, s-she will never understand. Ouch. Have you hurt your foot? Yes. I can help. I love foreigners, you see. What a delicate foot. Oh, thank you. You know, I went to London once. I think English women are the most beautiful of all. That's much better, thank you. My mother... My mother can't understand that I'm a man of pride. I'm proud to live on this island, where the famous colossus of rhodes used to stand. No tourists, no work. Where would Greece be without foreigners? Still buried underground! Ouch! I'm sorry! Oh, careful! Look out there. I'm building a monument to friendship with my money. You mean, a statue? By a real living artist! Donated by me, a patron of the arts. A patron of the arts? Thank you. It's funny about our names, isn't it? What is funny? Well, my name, it's... It's Carol lamb. You are--you are Caroline lamb? Yes. But lady Caroline lamb was lord Byron's greatest love. The love of his life. Yes. No. No. I cannot-- I cannot take rent from Caroline lamb. [Sighs] [Man, in Greek] Girl: [In English] Let's get a beer and find him. Girl #2: There's got to be other talent in the square. [In Greek] [In Greek] [In English] Sharpie, what would be the best present I could possibly give you? Get your niagara plumbing to work. That would be nice. No, that's asking for the impossible. I mean, really. What would you most like to have in the whole world? Oh, you mean, really? Not love, then, or peace for mankind? Uh, no, I mean, what money can buy. Oh, come on, there must be something. Anything at all. Well, I saw a nice little sketch the other day of king's college, Cambridge. You deserve it, you've got it. It's by constable. It costs about 20,000 pounds. Come with me. Katherine: I've had a letter from the dealer, konstantinis. "A client of mine is ready to pay $300,000 for it." I can't believe it. [Exhales] "There are, of course, a few problems, "but I understand sharpie's now staying with you. "All the better. I'm flying to rhodes on June the 17th to meet Roy's yacht, "so we can all have a jolly get-together "and sort things out. Yours, Mike." You have saved my life! My house, your summer home. Everything! Don't get carried away yet, Katherine. It's your name they're buying. Provenance is everything! I need a straight scotch. Me, too. Me, too. [Flies buzz] The only word I know is taramasalata. Yanni's got a more sort of sensitive face, I think. He's a nice boy, but he's weak. His father was a hero. My husband fought all invaders. Turkish. Germans. So, you do speak English. Kill English, too. [Sings] Hi. Man: Hi. Have you got it? Yeah, right color. Ready? Ready. [Laughs] The vampire strikes back. Not again. You've messed it all up. Mmm. I always liked your mother's lipstick. It's probably the only taste we share in common. It's not true, dad. She doesn't really hate your work. Well, let's say she has a very funny way of expressing her admiration. What have you said about the book? Your mother can't take criticism. I wouldn't dare. This whole monument's going to be done in marble, even the ash. How big is that cigarette going to be? Twice your height. A bit more. Foreigners aren't all bad. Animals, animals. They don't even cover themselves up. Like goats, naked. I happen to think it's very generous of yanni to honor the foreigners who love this country. Shows a lot of imagination. "Imagination." [Snickers] A monument to the unknown tourist. The monument is for a tourist? Oh, yes, I think so. Yes, you know, like the unknown soldier. [Inhales sharply] [Door slams] Chloe: Smoking is a disgusting habit, papa. Oh, I've got you a scarf here. Thanks, papa. Ban the bomb! Ban the bomb. Oh, don't forget mummy's ashtray. Thanks. Bye. Zorba! I've got zorba the Greek for the unveiling! [Hums] Anthony Quinn, Patrick! I've got Anthony Quinn! I've got him! I've got him! I've got him! He's coming tomorrow! He's coming to cut the ribbon! Zorba, lord Byron... Yanni. Beautiful Caroline lamb. [In Greek] [In Greek] [Sighs] [In English] Yanni, that's one hell of a mother. Oh. Hello.hello. Going to see the plumber? Yeah. He's sick. Having a nervous breakdown, I think. So will I, if his taps keep on leaking. So, uh, how's the esteemed art historian? Oh, he's very well. Still living in the past, is he? Patrick, we can't all keep up with the times like you. How's your monument? Which one? The unknown smoker? Mmm. Rather healthy. I've been to Texas. The Dallas arts center wants a 20-foot ashtray in green marble. We're arguing about the flame, though. I want an eternal flame. I was more interested in the unknown tourist and I don't mean the one you were fucking in the thistles the other day. Ha! Ah, Kat-- y-you saw it! You saw them. Ha! I mean, it was really, it was terrifying. I mean, you'll--you'll never believe it, Katherine. It was really-- it was frightening. I was gang-raped by a bunch of Amazons. There were 6! 6? Patrick, I wasn't asking about your private life. If you can call it that. I was referring to the concrete erection you plan to unveil on Sunday in front of the whole world. Every artist is an exhibitionist, Katherine, but only photographers are voyeurs. How long would it take a boat like this to get to Turkey? You like to go to Turkey? Yeah, maybe. Yeah, later. How long you go here, Greece, to Turkey? 3 and a half hours, sir. 3 and a half hours, eh? Turkey is not so good. Lord Byron swam to Turkey! [Giggles] Sharp: We could be marooned here rather a long time, couldn't we? Yes, sharpie, one day I'll meet someone who can fix an engine. And the plumbing. Imagine being chained to a rock with an eagle pecking out your stomach. Oh, yes, poor old prometheus. Well, what's so terrible about stealing fire? Sharp: Oh, it's rather like stealing the secrets of the atom bomb. You can't have gods without secrets, can you? A boat! Help! Help! Over here! What an effort nature makes to keep her little secrets. Mmm. I like taramasalata. You eat enough of it! Look, mummy, it's them! Hey! [Boat horn sounds] Katherine: Look, sharpie! It's konstantinis. My dealer from new York! He's arrived! God! Not now! Katherina! Katherine: You old fox! You look gorgeous! And Sophie! Chloe. Chloe. Oh, this is lovely. This is Carol lamb, Rick lamb. Hi, pleased to meet you. Where do we go? This way. This way. Down here, this way. About my vase-- excuse me. Yes? Where is our Mr. Sharp? Oh, uh, you'll see him later. Fine. Come, have a drink. [Opera music plays] [All shout and laugh] [Group shouts and laughs] Du vol-au-vent? Bloody layabouts, they make you sick, don't they? Jammy bastards! Great boat, eh? If principles don't get into the way, we'll have no problem, uh, smuggling it out. Ah, gracia. Rick: Carol. They're trying to smuggle something out of the country, and I think it's drugs. [Speaks Greek] So, what's the bottom line? Mr. Basil sharp! [Whistles] Well, basil, you've always had an eye for the real thing. Then why are you paying such a ridiculous price for it? What do you mean? I mean, $300,000 is an odd price for the real thing. Why not $500,000? [Laughs] He's not called sharp for nothing. Yes, of course, it's worth a great deal more. A lot more on fifth Avenue. But we're not on fifth Avenue, basil. You don't realize the beaches and the payoffs and the commissions on the way back to New York. Oh, yes. Mmm. It's illegal to take this vase out of Greece. It's a part of their national heritage. I could get put in jail for this. I suppose you could. And that's where you come in, basil. [Sniffs] I want you to say it's a fake. Of course, it may never happen. But I have to, uh, cover myself and you're my insurance. Sharpie, what he means is, I know it's an enormous favor to ask, but, could you tell a lie? Konstantinis: What's the lie, katherina? It is a lie. Shh, shh, shh. Basil's word is gospel. If he says it's a fake, it's a fake! And that's the beauty of it. I told you he was a crook. Come on, basil. This is business. Does katherina get her $300,000 or not? Well, I'd do a lot of things for Katherine. Of course it's a fake! Anyone can see it's a fake. Would you sign a letter to that effect? Yes, I'll sign it. If you'll pay an extra 20,000 to Katherine. What? Pounds. [Laughs] Po-- you can't be serious! Pity. [Katherine whispers] Sharpie, no, what are you doing? No. [Clears throat] [Snaps fingers] It's a deal. Oh! Eureka! Let's celebrate. Carol: $300,000, Rick. That's how much she's getting for an old Greek pot! All paid into a Panamanian bank account. That's where they keep it these days, in Panama. Rick:Panama. And it's tax-free. All she's got to do is smuggle it out of the country. I'd love to see it, Rick. Why don't you ask her? She likes you. Rick: Oh, come on, then. Carol: She does. [Donkey brays] She's quite beautiful. I like her lips. I like the way she moves her lips. Yeah, we've all got lips, Rick. Well, she's got style, hasn't she? Oh! Oh, style, is it? Hey, Benny! Hi, I'll see you at the bouzouki! All right. Yee-hah! Come on, move. ♪ Get them doggies moving ♪ ...and he's comin' around becher's brook! Come on... [Benny screams] Carol: "The mountains look on marathon "marathon looks on the sea "and musing there an hour alone "I dreamed that Greece might still be free" Byron died for this country, you know. Byron was a fart, wasn't he? You don't know what it means to be romantic, Rick. You'd never jump off a cliff for me. Look. I've had a butchers at that book that yanni gave you. I know a thing or 2 about your poet hero. [Female tourists chatter] Guide: Come down here and we'll look at these magnificent columns which is part of the ancient temple. If you keep coming down, you'll see the tomb of theophilus. Lord Byron was a drug addict, sex maniac. He had it off with anything with a pulse. Rick! Turkish tarts, kid sisters, little Greek boys, even goats! I don't believe that. No, don't believe me! Don't believe your own husband! Only lord yanni now. Look, look, it's a great honor to be asked to recite at the ceremony. Even Anthony Quinn's going to be there. Yeah, you're right, Carol. I'm worthless. I've got no red streak in my hair. I have no pot in Panama! I'm just a boring old pooh, Mr. Lamb! Farewell! Forever! [Screams] Help! Rick: I've got a hard-on. I want to see it. What? I want to see that vase, Rick! [Sighs heavily] [Greek music plays] [Sings in Greek] [Speaks Greek] Lovely party, Katherine. Thanks, barnaby. Good! Chloe, darling, thank you very, very much. Did you find Patrick? Yes, he wants you to ask him. Anyway, he's having his own celebration tomorrow. Oh, well, pashas must have jewels. Perfect. Give me those. Hello, Katherine! Hello, Rick. You look wonderful. I didn't realize it was going to be quite so special. I should've changed. Carol's over there. Ooh! [Laughs] [Hiccups] I had too much taramasalata. [Laughs] Wh-what would you like to call it? The unknown tourist. Chloe: Too lucky! 6 and 4. Basil! Hello, dear boy. Suits you, the little red streak. There was a call for you, basil. From London. Very important. Um, Mr. Thompson. He's coming tomorrow morning at 8:00. So... The "black spot" has arrived. Like in treasure island? Sorry, Chloe. I hope you can come tomorrow. It's the unveiling of my monument. I'll do my best. [Loud chattering] Katherina! Have a dionysus' delight, Mr. C. Thanks. That basil sharp is a sentimental old fool. He's insane! How can the British museum give the Elgin marbles back to the Greeks? It's like giving-- giving Arizona back to the apaches! [Laughs] I'm sorry. I hardly touched it. Katherine: That's my niagara. Porca miseria! [Penelope, in Greek] [Breathing heavily] [In English] Rick. I've found it! What? I've found the pot, Rick. Just wait, Carol, will you? I've found Katherine's pot! Lovely. It's dripping on me. [Flushes] [Music plays] Stay there, Rick. It's very easy to have style if you've got things like this. Rick: Don't, Carol! $300,000, Rick! Carol! [Gasps] Christ, you're out of your fucking mind! Jesus, you are out of your mind! Guest: Is basil in here? Um, uh, uh, I think--i think he's in the kitchen. Fuss over nothing. What are you trying to do to me? I cannot live with this tension. For Christ's sake, watch what you're doing. You are so bloody nosy. There's no need to panic! Bloody hell-- [gasps] [Carol gasps] Oh, my god! Rick: Oh! Oh! [Thumps] Carol! Carol: I feel funny. Carol, you stupid bitch! Sharpie? Sharpie! I am in such a silly mood tonight. I'm so relieved, I love everybody. Have a drink. Thanks. Mmm! Look at the moon. Look at the moon, sharpie. Look at the moon. I could get up to some real mischief tonight! Now, Katherine, listen. Come on down! Come on down! Oh, Katherine... Let me go, Rick. Oh! Oh! Konstantinis: What is it? Does she need a drink? Yes, she's all right. She's had quite enough to drink, thank you. Katherine: Does she need a doctor? No, I think she's all right. Caroline, my little lamb! Push off, will ya? She's my little lamb! What have you done to her? I haven't done anything, just leave her alone. Rick, I'm going to throw up! Hey, put her down, mate. Have a drink. Sorry I can't give you a hand, mate. I've had an argument with a donkey. Katherine: Ah, Penelope, you've come! [In Greek] [In English] Oh, thank you. Come in. Yanni is dancing. [In English] Dancing! I love my son, but, he--he breaks my heart like this. He's not unlike his father. His father gave his life for this country, his blood for this earth! [Huffs] Penelope, his father... Died drunk, falling off a cliff, dancing. He was a great dancer. Glue. Rick: What? You can stick anything together these days. Shut up, Carol. What are we going to do? I don't know. If I can get those pieces out, we can make them think it was stolen. Rick. Yup. Rick. What? Turkey. Hey? They'll never find US there. Oh, shut up, Carol. I've got to get rid of the evidence. Oh, Christ! I hope it's not too bloody late. [Door opens] I don't know what you see in her lips. I've got lips. [Shuffling] [Snores] [Door opens] Shit! Rick. You didn't tell me. Uhh... You didn't tell me what you'd done! No. You mended the niagara! Ahh--oh. I love you! You're a real man. Mmm. Katherine, there's, uh... Oh. There's--there's something I have to tell you. Let's go to the beach. Let's go to the beach. [Snores] [Snores] [Snores] Let's get out of here! Ah-- come. Come. Yes. [Rick laughs] Katherine: That way! Go that way! [Laughs] Rick: Katherine! Whoo! Whoo! I've got to tell you something. I don't want to know anything. Don't be so serious! I wanna be silly! A fling with a zing! [Laughs] [Music plays] [Musician sings in Greek] Oopah! Oopah! Both: Oopee! [Laughs] [In Greek] [Sings in Greek] [Music plays in background] [Rick laughs] Katherine: [In English] It's wonderful! It's great! Oh! Whoo! Whoo! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Oh, Patrick! Rick. Ah! Oh! Oh, I can't believe this! Oh, Katherine! Oh, Patrick, I love you! It's Rick. I love you, too. Oh, Patrick. It's Rick. Rick? Yes. I'm cold. I'm cold. I'm a bit drunk. Where are my clothes? I'm freezing! [Shivers] Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'll warm you up. I've never felt like this before! Rick, I'm terribly sorry. Don't be sorry. This is the most... It's the most fantastic night of my life. You're the most wonderful woman I've ever met! No, I'm not. Oh, yes, you are, you're... Oh, you're the woman of a lifetime. No. I have to go. What? I have to go. B-But... I have to go. I do. I'm terribly-- I'm very sorry. I do. Oh! I have to go.Wait! Shit. Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Rick! Rick! [Cat meows] Where are you? Patrick. Patrick. Patrick. [Moans] Patrick, I do need to speak to you. I want to know something. Do you love me? Love you? What time is it? It's--it's late. Do you love me, or don't you? Katherine, what is this? Oh. I'm sorry. Do you love me now? [Sighs] Yes, Katherine, I love you. Patrick, this is important. Do you really love me? [Sighs] Yes, I love you. Love me? What else? What does that mean? Excuse me. Sorry. Love, it's, um, it's something to do with the heart, isn't it? What are you going to do about it? Do? What do you want me to do? Have our 3rd affair? Get married again? All right. Okay, then. Now, for Christ's sake, let me get some sleep. Good night. Katherine: Night. [Locks door] Katherine: Patrick, your tap, it's dripping. Sharp: "Far and few, "far and few "are the lands where the jumblies live "their heads are green "and their hands are blue "and they went to sea in a sieve" yanni! What'll they do with the 10th man, yanni? Dear yanni. Kind yanni. No, no, Rick lamb. I love you, yanni. No. You're so... Sweet. Thank you. One of these days, someone's going to mistake me for me. Come on, get up, that's right. Sharp: They'll send me to the land of the chankly bore. Dear yanni. Rick: I'm not yanni. To the land of the chankly bore! Come on. Come on. I'm sorry, you know, about our quarrel. Katherine, don't start again. But we've got to have it out. And I do like your work. I like it, in a gallery. Putting up the unknown tourist in the main square of lindos is a joke. What's wrong with a joke? It's not funny. It's too true. It's ironic, Katherine. It's the way things are. It's cynical. Who's that girl, by the way? June. June who? Oh, I don't know. You see? People are all the same to you, aren't they? You're too lazy to really care about anyone. And why did it have to be me who has to come up here and make up with you? You said you never wanted to talk to me again in your life. Those were your words. But you know I don't mean it. You're too lazy to do anything about it. You said you hated the unknown tourist. Well, I hate it here in the square. It's yanni's commercial wheeze. All right, Katherine, if you want to have it out... What about your book, the light of Greece? What about it? There's not one single photograph of modern Greece in it, not one. It's as if beauty died somewhere out there, in the distant past. You're as out of date as your dear friend basil sharp. Keep basil out of it. Out of it? You can say that again. He's missed the last 2,000 years. Is there anything else, Patrick? You sure you want to hear this? Yes, I do. The light, Katherine. Where is the light of Greece? I mean, this is the light of Kodak! If you can't see the light, Patrick, you must be blind and you certainly don't understand me. [Shatters] Patrick: And if my work is so offensive to you, you certainly don't understand me! By the way, if you need one, I know a great plumber who really know how to use a screwdriver. [Door slams] [Sings in Greek] [In Greek] [Sighs] Carol: [In English] Yanni, nobody but yanni. Who cares if Anthony Quinn doesn't come? This is what matters! [Laughs] Caroline. [Laughs] It's your day tomorrow! Yanni: Caroline. Listen. "The mountains looked on Panama "and Panama looked on the sea..." No, "marathon looked on the sea" yanni, I've done something dreadful! Shh. [Sobs] Shh. Shh. Caroline, [groans] Look at me. I love you. [Gasps] [In Greek] [In English] Sharpie? Ooh. Hey. Come on, baby. Come on. Come on, baby. Come on. Out we go, come on. Move. Come on. Come on, baby. Ooh. What a night, sharpie. [Moans] You sleep it off. I didn't mean what I said. You know I like your book. [Rooster crows] [Goat bleats] [Goat bleats] [Donkey brays] Sharp: How about you? Did you have a silly time? Oh, yes, wonderfully silly. With Patrick. Oh. I'm glad. You seemed so happy last night, I hadn't the heart to tell you, but some rather terrible things happened. I'm afraid there was a breakage. I found it like this. It can't be true! Well, not quite true. You see, it's a fake. A fake? My vase is a fake? Exactly what I told konstantinis it was. I wasn't lying. Very beautiful, of course, and quite old. Early 19th-century copy. It's worth sticking together, I think. Oh, my pot. What happened? I mean, who broke it, sharpie? I don't know. I found it on the floor. Katherine: But I... I locked it in the cupboard, I think. Didn't I? There's something else I have to tell you. It's about me. I'm the real fake in this story. They haven't named me yet, but they will. Today or tomorrow. They'll call me a traitor. Some of the things they've accused me of are true. I did pass secrets to the Russians during the war. [Gasps] [Whispers] Are you a spy? It's a shock for you, I know. You see, when I was very young, the communists seemed... Well, they were the only people ready to organize against fascism. Are you-- are you the 10th man? [Rooster crows] The 15th, I believe. Oh, Katherine. Try to understand. Your generation has been taught to think that we were bound to oppose the Nazis. But you can't possibly imagine the apathy that there was in england before the war. Oh, yes, I think I can. In the Nazis, I saw hell on earth. It made me blind about the communists. Then, when the war ended, with the atom bomb, that was another kind of hell. Anyway, the past has caught up with me. And I'm ready to pay for it. [Donkey brays] Sharpie, you can't go to jail! In a way, it'll be a relief. I can't bear it! [Sobs] I did tell you it was a copy, by the way, when I gave it to you. Though you probably forgot. The one thing in my life that I've never consciously lied about was a work of art. Though I suppose I might have done it for you. But that's because I love you. [Sniffs] One can do almost anything for love. [Vomits] Well, well, what do you know? James "sharpie" bond. And I thought he was out of date. Carol? Carol! Where's my gun? It's not a gun, Rick. It's a pot. Look, my gun is gone! Where's my fucking gun? It's not a gun, Rick. It's a pot. Where's my gun? What's that? Oh, look, my jacket's not even pressed! I could lose my bloody license for this! What license? To kill! Rick? [Donkey brays] Attendez. Hello, basil. [Sneezes] Hello, Thompson. Damned air conditioning on these planes. Summer colds are the worst, aren't they? I've been expecting this for years. Jail might even give me a chance to finish my book. A few friends will visit me, the ones that matter. I don't think you quite understand, basil. Nobody wants to put you in jail. The fact is, basil, nobody... Oh, bless you. ...wants a public enquiry at all. We want you--want you-- want you to escape! Escape. Escape? You are at the Istanbul Hilton for one night. Then on Bulgarian airways to Sofia. Bulgarian airways? We booked you in at the vishota. It's supposed to be comfortable. I expect the other side will pick you up from there. But... But I don't want to live in Moscow. Nobody does. But somebody's got to. Ah, I'm David Locke. Basil basilovich next, I suppose. Better for everybody. Ah, here's your tour guide. Mr. Lamb. Are you all right, lamb? This is your passenger, David Locke. He'll see you off, help with the bags. I think that's everything. Have a pleasant trip. Right. Tell me, Mr. Lamb, did you know who I was, the day you picked US up on the beach? No, sir. Katherine will be as surprised as I am. Look, I'm sorry. Well, no, I'm not going to apologize! You're a traitor! You betrayed your country! Now they're letting you go scot-free. You should be hanged! When will you be coming to collect the bags? She know who you are, does she? Are you going to tell her what a liar you are? Oh! Or am I going to sweep the dirty facts under the carpet, like you? Oh, don't worry. I'll cover for you. She's got enough problems. I would have thought I had a right to know I was married to a spy! I'm not a spy. I'm an agent. They only sent me because everybody else in the department had flu. Nail Polish. What's the difference, you both have to lie, don't you? He's a traitor, Carol. Yes, but he's covering up for US, isn't he? Despise me. [Sighs] Katherine's going to despise me. Oh, shut up, Rick. You're spoiling everything. How am I supposed to remember my lines? Oh, my god, I can't find the nail Polish! [Hums battle march] [Sings in Greek] [In Greek] [Marching band plays] [Sings in Greek] [In English] I left some letters in my room, in the drawer. One of them is for yanni. I was very fond of him, you know. Oh, sharpie... 5 minutes, all right? Yes, sir. [In Greek] [Crowd cheers] [Drum roll] Man: It's Benny! [Crowd gasps] [Crowd cheers] Benny: Bloody hell! Get away, go on! I'm going, I'm going! "The isles of Greece--" man: Give her a chance! "The isles of Greece..." [In Greek] [In English] "And musing there "an hour alone "I dreamed that Greece "might still be free" [gun fires] [Crowd screams] [Penelope, in Greek] [Woman screams] [Gun fires] [Woman, in Greek] [In Greek] [In Greek] [Band plays] [In Greek] Yanni: [In English] Hold on. [In Greek] [Gun fires] [In Greek] [Woman screams] [Yanni, in Greek] Carol: Yanni! Yanni! [In Greek] [In English] I'll give you statues! I'll build the biggest statue in the world. I'll rebuild the colossus of rhodes. Sharp: I've got another vase for you in London. A genuine one. But my word may not count as it did. I think the boat's ready now, sir. Ah. I didn't know it was going to be him. Nobody's accusing you of anything. But, I... Well, I suppose I mustn't miss the boat. And you mustn't miss the unknown tourist. We'll send you lots of things! Food parcels, Christmas pudding. It's the boat at the end. [Dog barks] Ban the bomb. Ban the bomb. Take this. I want you to have it. Katherine. Chloe: My jeans, sharpie! They're worth a fortune! They don't have them in Russia. Oh, Chloe, really! I don't need jeans. Jeans! Catch! Take them off! But I'm on duty! You owe me a damn sight more than a pair of jeans! Now, give them to me! Come on! [Dog barks] Unh! Thank you. Goodbye! Bye, sharpie. [Boat motor sounds] I'll write to you forever! Chloe: Bye! Goodbye! Opisthia! Sharpie! Opisthia,sharpie! Opisthia! I can't hear you. Opisthia. Your future's behind you. Did sharpie tell you that? Yep. [Goat bleats] Katherine: "Dearest sharpie... "You'll never guess who ended up buying your genuine pot. "Konstantinis! "Thanks to your help, I still have my house. "But my view from the terrace "is horribly empty without you. "If you think the statues in Moscow "are too heroic for your taste, "I wonder what you would have thought "of Patrick's monument in Dallas. "He was wonderfully brave, though. "He used the unveiling to stub out his last cigarette. "Meanwhile, here in lindos, "yanni seems determined to outdo everyone, "to set his stamp on the world. "He's begun work on what he says will be "the biggest statue in Greece. "The new colossus of rhodes. "So far, Penelope seems to be taking it in her stride. "But one never knows with her." [In Greek] [Laughs] [Laughs hysterically]
