ALMOST Organic vegetable delivery! What about organ donation? Oh yes, I've always believed in that. Don't know if they'll find much to use. I don't believe in God. And you? Me either. Any preferences for clothing? A particular garment? Will you take care of me? I hope to be retired. Any personal items you wish to keep with you? A wedding ring? I'll be gone, right? Hello, everyone. - They're waiting for you downstairs. - I know. The ashes are fine, but look. The problem is usually here, on the left. You didn't check the sides. There you go! The ashtray can't open with this inside. That's what happened. This one's huge. Your tie. Oh, yeah. I made this for you. That's sweet, thanks. I prepared the obituaries. Did you see them? There's a mistake. There are two for Mr. Giraud. It's not a mistake. His two wives don't get along, so his latest wife wrote one with her son. Fine. Thanks. Roger, come with me. - Hello, Nicole. - We're in a bind. Yes? There are two home pick-ups and a funeral, and Joachim is all alone. And? We just had another call for a pick-up. There's no family and the home helper has to leave at five. Text me the address and I'll meet you there. I remember the day we took this picture. Naturally, you can change your mind. Madeleine Lascaux 6 Cerisiers Street That's exactly him. With his smile. Excuse me. I'll take this one. Do you believe in God, Mr. Caretti? Yes, I do. We had a son. His name was Jean. He was born early on in our marriage. Meningitis. There was nothing to do. My husband wanted nothing to do with God after that. My faith is what helped me. My husband kept these in his night table for almost forty years. Could you put them in his hands? That's where they belong. Careful with the tomatoes. Not too tough? No, it's great exercise. And I meet tons of people. If I could run away to a desert island, I'd leave at once. Why do you want to go rot on a desert island? You're not happy? Want to go for a drink one of these days? Tell Mrs. Castella there's no lettuce. Okay, sure. Thanks. Shit. Are you alright? Sorry. I'm sorry. It was my fault. Are you okay? Will you be alright? Here. Did you hit your head? No, I'm fine. Gosh. Oh no, look here. You're cut. You're bleeding. You see? Should I call an ambulance? Do you think there are any foxes here? Foxes? I don't know. Hang on, don't move. Don't move, stay there. You understand me? Yes. There's been an accident on Route des Martines. - Don't worry, everything's fine. - Thanks. Everything's okay? - Yes, thank you. And you? - Just fine. We'll take him for an X-ray. - What's this about a fox? - I didn't understand myself. You're afraid of foxes? They don't attack, you know. No, I'm afraid of echinococcosis. I heard about it on the radio. It's a disease you get from fox feces. - I see. - You can get liver cancer. Don't worry, you're in no danger. Please sign, here. Can you... help me? Of course. It's "I" for Igor. Perfect. Now for your X-ray, Igor. Caroline will take you. Okay. You'll wait for him here? You're scared of a dog? I'm coming. I just ran a cripple off the road. You want a photo too? I've never heard of it. - Mr. Caretti, how are you? - Great. - He's your brother. - No. I see. I made two stitches, he's fine. The probability of a fox doing its duty right where he fell is almost zero. But it's not impossible. Listen, it's even more probable for a meteorite to fall on our heads here and now. We won't waste your time. I gave him a sedative. You'll be fine. More fear than pain! Fear is a sad passion. The worst slavery of all. You know him? Not really, he's just a hospital acquaintance. I don't want to be nosy, but what do you do for a living? When I tell people, it usually casts a chill. I don't have to say a thing to cast a chill. You're a mortician? That's not just any old job! It's fascinating. Think you can get home alone? Do you see dead people every day? 800 to 900 a year. That's huge! Can I invite you for a drink for the hassle? Sorry, I have to go. A dead person? Yes. - Thank you. - It was the least I could do. Sorry, I think I forgot my book. I never thought I'd meet an undertaker while I was still alive. Thanks. He hasn't stopped barking since she died. I fed him, I talked to him... Animals can smell death. I called her daughter. She's her only family. Her son died in a car accident. She wanted her son's ashes with her. She's gone! You hear me? Gone. Come on. I prepared her clothes. She wanted to wear this top. - May I go? - Will her daughter will come? I don't know, she lives in Marseille. They'd fallen out. Here's her number. - My kids are waiting at school. - You can go. Thanks. "If in all that you wish to do, you begin by asking yourself: 'Am I certain that I would wish to do this an infinite number of times?' This should be for you the most solid center of gravity. My doctrine says, the task is to live your life in such a way that you must wish to live it again, for you will anyway! If striving gives you the highest feeling, then strive!

This is Judith Lascaux's voicemail, please leave me a message. You're still here? Joachim said you had an accident? That's right. An accident. With a handicapped person. That must be frightening. - One time... - Any news from the Lascaux girl? Yes. We transport the body to Sète tomorrow. She doesn't know if she wants to keep the dog. She'll call me back. Thank you. You can go now, it's late. Good night, Nicole. I wish you'd stop those vegetable deliveries. It worries me. All day long on that tricycle! It's dangerous. I met a really nice guy yesterday. He's an undertaker. A great guy. You know the young woman who comes here twice a week? She's interested in lots of things. Like you. You two should meet. Mom! Stop trying to marry off your handicapped kid. You have lots of charm, angel. Oh yeah? With my looks? Besides, as soon as I open my mouth, it's all over. I'm sure you could make a girl happy. When the time comes, will you be there to help me put a condom on? All day long, I try to be a little freer. Independent. Everyone wants to pigeonhole me, and you expect me to live up to your fantasies. Leave me alone. Let me be. I'm serious. Think of yourself. I have a delivery to make. - You won't stay for lunch? - I have to go. I have work. - You'll come for dinner tonight? - Yeah. I'll prepare your laundry. Thanks, Mom. - I'll let you take the photo? - Sure. - Is he done? - Just a few touch-ups to the face. Don't forget the pacemaker, it's a cremation. But for Mr. Chassart, we still don't know if it's a cremation or burial. Mr. Caretti? - The Chassarts haven't decided? - They're not talking. They better make up their minds. We can't cut him in two. - Someone's here to see you. - No one can help them? He insists on seeing you. It's the handicapped man you ran over. Hello. Hi, I was in the neighborhood. It's organic. It's for me? Thanks, that's very nice. How are you? Very well. I'm sorry, but I have a meeting. Working here must be crazy. Really puts things into perspective. Is this one expensive? 900 without the extras. What are the extras? The handles. Brass, copper, even gold. Gold handles? Isn't that throwing money out the window? To each his own. How do you keep from becoming hardened? Do you need a coffin? No, not right now. Are these the cheap ones? No, they're sustainable wood and even more expensive. They're organic too. I'll leave you now. I'm sorry, I have work. Thanks. Thanks. We have the repatriation from Naples. Philippe? No, not me. What's the problem? It's the fourth this month. For one. It's school holidays. I've got the kids and Naples is far. Serge? I have the Lascaux repatriation. That's for me. You can't. - It's impossible. - No. You think I can't drive a hearse? Of course you can, but you have a busy schedule. Graveyards are full of indispensable people. You'll get by fine without me. Here. Have a good day. Even if we can lighten the load of avoidable sorrows, at some point we all experience non-reciprocal love, perhaps disease, and old age and death. Tragedy is always there. Tragedy is there, and so are we. Between the two, everything remains to be built. Your suit. Thank you. - The papers are ready? - They're in the glove compartment. - The flowers? - They'll be waiting for you. The weather's good, I checked. - Mr. Caretti... - Yes? - You sure you're okay? - Just fine. Oh, shit. I don't believe it. What are you doing here? Excuse me, I'm sorry. Do you realize you're in a hearse? I was doing a metaphysical experiment. It might seem silly, but Plato says that philosophizing means to practice dying. Where are we? Practice dying? We're 100 miles from Lausanne! You drive too fast. Yeah, right. What do I do now, turn back? It's simple. You take care of your dead person and I'll take care of myself. Yeah, right. I leave you out here in nowhere? Don't worry, everything's cool. I won't bother you anymore. Are you going to Lausanne? Thanks. Anyone going to Lausanne? Are you going to Lausanne? Excuse me. Are you going to Lausanne? I'm going to Montpellier. You can take a train to Lausanne. - You can take a train alone? - Sure, I can. I know how to buy a ticket. Careful, hot plate. Thank you. Do you have a straw and a soupspoon? A straw and...? A spoon. A big one, please. Big spoon. I ordered a hamburger patty. Isn't it the same? Would you mind cutting the meat for me? Excuse me. Like this? Yes. Are you mad at me? No, not at all. Here's the straw. And a big spoon. Thank you. Anything else for him? No idea. Everything's perfect. Super. Thanks. Okay. We'll get going in 10 minutes. Okay. Excuse me, would you mind putting the cup... On the table? Sure. - Sorry. - Don't be. - He's sure taking long. - Yes, it's a bit long. It's just an expresso, but a long one. I'll take a second one. Careful! Let me help you. I need to get to Montpellier. I don't have all day. Can't you see it's complicated? Chill. When it's complicated, you sit at a table and get waited on. Are you stupid or what? - I'm stupid? - Yes. I'm the stupid one? What's going on? You can't say anything anymore. Fucking dictatorship! What an idiot. You okay? What happened? I just wanted to buy you a cup of coffee. Thanks. The Stoics say we should imagine the worst possible every day. This was the worst. Thank you. What's he doing? The bastard! Stupid bitch! Asshole! Shit. Fucking hell. And it's freezing cold. I'll cut that creep down to size. "Shit driver, dangerous and rude." Send. Zero out of 5! With that... he's screwed. Sorry about your boyfriend. - Who? - I'm sorry. He's not my boyfriend! I shared a ride. I'd rather hear that. My name's Cathy. Are you going to Montpellier by chance? Yes, but I'm not authorized to take passengers. Yes, you are. With you, it's different. Don't worry, it sounds complicated. I'll find a way. It's a mess, but no problem. Who said that? I love it! "It's a mess, but no problem." No one said it, just me. - Sorry. - No problem. Come on, let's go. Nietzsche says that the best way to begin each day is to think upon awakening who we could give pleasure to that day. Beautiful. - You think so? - I agree 100 percent. Cathy! - What are you doing? - Come with us! - No... - Thank you! Holy cow, I was really up shit creek. Ah, I see. Now I understand. - You work at a funeral home? - Not me, him. Hang on, there's someone in... Yes. - A family member? - No. Oh wow, this is really kind of weird. Ready to go? This is weird. I tried to warn you. Who is it? - A dead person. - I could've guessed that. What happened? Heart attack. It's crazy. You wake up one morning with lots of projects and bam! You end up in there. Bad day. Who's in the urn? The woman's son. They died at the same time? No. He died long ago. My question is, how do you become an undertaker? That's a good question. It's a calling? You know many kids who dream of being undertakers? How can you experience joy when you're scared to death of kicking the bucket? It doesn't bother you? With my job, you're quickly vaccinated. You never think about it? No. I don't see the point. It'll happen when it happens. When you're dead, you're dead. You don't realize it. That's pure Epicurus! If I am, then death is not. And if Death is, then I am not. There you go. That's the question, should you prepare yourself, or to the contrary, not give a shit? Montaigne said that he wanted death to find him carefree, planting his cabbages, happy in his garden. It's fabulous. Did you eat a book for breakfast? More like a whole library. Shit, there are no trains before 8:30 tomorrow morning. I'll manage. The exercise here is: "It's beyond my control, so trust and let go." Well, well. If you say so. - Have you known each other for long? - Not at all. I met him yesterday. I was making a delivery. A delivery? I deliver organic vegetables. We're both delivery men of sorts. - Here's perfect. - Here? Okay. Fantastic. Thanks, guys. It was cool. I'll see you tonight? Yeah, great. I'll send you the address. Bye! Would you mind if I slept in the same hotel as you? I'd like that. Hello, sir. Welcome. You should have a reservation for Mr. Caretti. Yes, that's correct. Here. - And another room for the gentleman. - Of course. Do you have rooms with two beds? Why, what for? It's easier. No, two rooms. Two rooms. Or else maybe, two rooms next to each other. I have a room that has a communicating door with yours. That's perfect. - Here you go. - Thanks. Great. There's the elevator. Second floor to the left. Excuse me. Do you have a minute? Can you come here? Thank you. What's that? No idea. A drop. A drop of what? I don't know. Did you use the toilet? No. - You didn't flush the toilet? - No, that's the point. Okay. Look, you see? It splashed. - It's water. - But I didn't flush. Maybe it was the cleaning lady. Something's there. What exactly are you worried about? Diseases. You spew grand theories about life, Nietzsche and the Stoics, and you're afraid of an imaginary fox or a possible drop of pee. Yes. You can have a fantastic toolbox in the basement and be a lousy handyman. Like I said, they're formulas. Yes, but these "formulas" as you call them saved my life. Without Spinoza, Plato, Nietzsche and the others, I'd be dead. But you're right, the challenge is to put it into practice, and I have my work cut out for me. It's Cathy! "We're at The Hideout, Marché du Lez." You coming? No, I want to get to bed early. The Greeks call this "Caerus." The opportune moment. Before it's too early, after too late. My Caerus will have to wait. You sure? Yes. Go on, have a nice evening. Thanks. It's Igor. Igor! I don't believe it, you came! How are you? - And you? - Great, at last. Come here. Hey, girls. I'll introduce you. Bérengère, the future bride. With her diadem. - Caro. - Good evening. Patricia. And Natasha. This is Igor. Without him, I wouldn't be here. Thank you, Igor. The future groom, where's he hiding? - I locked him in. - Tied to the radiator. I'll free him tomorrow. It's the whole idea of a bachelorette party. We have fun one last time. Before the end... Before she starts her new life. The good times are over. You don't have to answer if I'm being nosy, but what happened... Did you have an accident? Oh, that. I did too many somersaults when I was in my mother's belly, and my umbilical cord played a nasty trick on me. And this is the result. I think you seem... normal. It doesn't show. Almost. - We met a babe. - A true sweetheart. Here, Igor. You never lose track! Judith, I know how hard this must be... It's not possible now? No, I understand. That's kind of late. But, okay. See you later. A heap of flesh. Nails. Hair follicles. Guts. Organs and entrails. Genitals. Sorry. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Good night. Come on! Igor! Come here! Thanks, Lucas! I hope you like marshmallows! Come on, your turn. Do you like marshmallows and sugar? Yes! Come on! You have to eat it all! In the mouth! It tickles! Go, Igor! I see you're having fun. The undertaker is here! You're in top form. I'm in total non-control of the situation. It shows. Woman Woman I dedicate these words to you! Only to you! They will tell you how, from nothing You made a man of me... Hello, Mom. I'm out and about. Out and about! With who? My undertaker friend. I told you about him. I promise, I'll be home tomorrow. Don't worry yourself sick. Chill, Mom. Ciao. That's weird, you touch corpses? Of course, but that's not the hardest part. - It isn't? - No. I couldn't. At my dad's funeral, my mom kept saying "kiss him." There was no way. - It's better to touch the living. - Damn right. Are you married? Nope, separated and divorced. The usual. - Do you have kids? - No. - Here you go. - Thanks! Here. Cheers! Sorry, I've had too much to drink. I'd like to make a toast to Bérengère. Of course! And to my first trip in a hearse. First but not last! It was a warm-up lap. I'm in no hurry. Take your time. It's funny, the Greeks say you ought to behave in life like at a banquet. Enjoy the food and savor the conversations. And when the meal is over, you get up, thank your hosts, and leave. I think it's beautiful. After the meal, you can have some coffee. With chocolate and brandy! And a Baby Cool. Yeah, a Baby Cool! I'd even take the cold leftovers. - I loved philosophy. - Not me. Yeah, me either. I couldn't wait to study it as a senior. What does Mr. Undertaker think? - I think I'm going to leave. - No way! I apologize, but you can carry on. I'll run to the men's room. If you want, I can take you home. Did we say something wrong? What if we allowed ourselves another warm-up lap? To seriously bury her old life! Great idea. Have you lost your minds? There's someone in there. Show some respect, shit. I don't believe it. What? No one died. Calm down! - He's totally nuts. - Igor! It's okay. I'm sorry, you alright? I'm sorry. Okay everyone, we're turning in. Bye, Igor. He's gone. It's the first time anyone's slugged me. It's a first for me too. I was about to split. There's two of you? No. I don't know where I put my key. Did you look for it? I'm sorry, I don't have it. Did you check your pockets? There's nothing. What about your bag? Sorry, no. Okay. I'll be right back. Sorry. No problem. It's funny, Boethius says we're like drunkards looking for our home. We have a vague idea where it is, we totter, we stumble, we fall, and we keep moving forward. Do you do this often? When people are willing. What are you looking at? I'm cutting you up into pieces. Clinically. Flesh, hair, and bones. Sweet. It's a Stoic remedy called a "merism." It's supposed to keep passion at bay. Does it work? No. Here you go. Thanks. Goodbye, ma'am. Need anything else? No, I'll manage. Okay then, good night. You don't look anything like the photo. Is it a problem? No. Ready? Let's go. Excuse me. Do you have some toothpaste? Don't move. Thanks. - Here. - Great, thanks. Can you open it for me? That's great, thanks. Good night. Thank you. Your brother? No. We just met. He was on his tricycle and I ran him over. And now he's here. He's surprising, to say the least. This isn't going to work. You don't like me? I drank too much and it's awkward. Okay. He seems to like you a lot. Sorry. Don't be, it happens. No regrets? I'll go say goodbye to him. You okay? Fine, thank you. What are you doing? I was meditating. Sorry. Can I do it with you? It might help me. I can never fall asleep. It's not a sleeping pill. Tell me what to do. That's the whole point, you do nothing. You go down deep inside. If thoughts arise... you let them pass. As if they were clouds. You grasp onto nothing. It's not easy. What are you thinking? I'm thinking that my body is hideous. You're right, don't grasp onto thoughts like that. What are you thinking? I think I'm going to shut the door. If you're okay with it. Tell me that my body is revolting. No. Your body isn't revolting. You don't have to. I know I don't. What's stopping me from leaving? I'll dirty you. I'm scared. This isn't your first time? A little. A little? Have you ever made love? Just little times. Okay. We'll try to make this a big time. Close your eyes. Keep your hand on me. My name is Elsa. Like Aragon. Yes. Are you happy? I don't ask myself the question. But if you did? I'm not unhappy. Thank you. I didn't do much. I never would've thought that this body could give joy. It's as if the struggle was gone. At the Institute, they wore gloves to take care of us. Zero affection. Not an ounce, nothing. They called it "therapeutic distance." Seventeen years. When I was born, my father ran off. My mother had to take charge. Every Sunday, she left me there methodically. And she recovered me on Friday. The bitch. What did you do? Jerked off and took a shower. If you saw a guy like me dead. Like this. Would you notice that something was not right? No, I don't think so. I'd think: "What a nice corpse!" Have you always done this job? I took over from my father when I turned 30. But ever since I was a kid, I was "the undertaker's son." I attracted curious kids. They'd ask tons of questions. Some were afraid and avoided me. But there were advantages. I could captivate an audience with stories about hanged men and missing limbs. As a teenager, I'd even take girlfriends into the cold rooms to show them bodies and impress them. It didn't always work. Has it become banal? It's become my life. Sometimes, when I see you in action, I think you're a true Stoic. Everything rolls like water off a duck's back. Nothing bothers you. You're a duck. This duck is getting sleepy. Let's get some sleep. Can I stay here? Yes, sure. - Good night. - You too. My duckie. This is for Joachim... Could you get that? Hello. I came to get my son Igor. - Igor? - Yes, he's with Mr. Louis. One moment, please. Nicole. Do we know an Igor? Hello, ma'am. There's no Igor here. He's with Mr. Louis. There must be a mistake, Mr. Caretti is traveling. He was with him last night. His tricycle is here. I can't get a hold of my son, he's not answering. There must be a misunderstanding. Let me see what I can do. Hello, Nicole. I'm with Mrs. Paratte, Igor's mother. Do you know where he is by chance? He's with me. I see. She's worried sick. Where are they? Montpellier. Montpellier? In France? Tell her that I'm taking him to the station. He's going back to Lausanne. She wants to talk to him. She can't, he's taking a shower. Very well. I have to get going. There you are. - Everything okay? - Yes. Did you sleep well? Yes. - Did you enjoy breakfast? - Yeah, it was great. Great. We should get going or you'll miss your train. Take it easy. Worst case, I'll take the next one. In the Zen tradition, there's a super simple exercise. Each time you go through a door, you let yourself die. You leave the past and regrets behind, and open yourself up to life! There you go. Come on, hurry up. "Cédric Lascaux. 1969... to 1986." He was super young. Seventeen years old. Are they flashing us? A hearse? That would surprise me. - What's this about? - Hello. You think you can run red lights? - No. - You didn't see it? Your papers, please. Excuse me. Thank you. I'm sorry, I really didn't see it. Like always. I need the death certificate and customs papers. Sure. Death certificate... And the sealing certificate. Hang on. We're in a hurry, can we... Mommy is in the box. We need to go to the ceremony. Those things... They're going to ring the bells. Mommy died. She's in the box. Yes, it's his mother. We need to go. It's his mother, so he's kind of... Nice Louis. - We need to go. - Nice Louis. Okay, you can go. But no speeding, okay? We need to get going. - Goodbye, see you. - Bye. I'd like to continue the road trip with you. And Cédric and Madeleine. It's funny, I get the impression you know them. We're connected. Did you know them? Maybe I'll tell you another time. Before, I only had paper friends. Nietzsche, Spinoza and Descartes. With you it's different. You're a friend in flesh and blood. Thank you. Sorry to insist, but I'd really like to come with you. I think you should go home. Your mother's worried. My mother can go to hell. She's been breaking my balls for 37 years. Did she worry when she put me in the Institute? The bitch? Aren't the four of us happy? All contentment of mortals is mortal! Montaigne! The greatest traveler is not the one who has made 10 trips around the world, but he who did it once around himself. Gandhi. From the menu of my favorite Indian restaurant. Roger! Hi, Roger! Want a ride? There's room in the back. Where are you on your happiness scale? If you turn the music up: "9.5." - And you? - Okay, I'm with you. You're not answering? No, it's just work. Nothing important. I'm sure everything's fine. Love! Love! Love is a gypsy child It has never, never known the law If you don't love me, I love you If I love you, be on your guard! Be on your guard! Looks like he fell too. What's the problem? Something wrong? If there is, tell us. Doesn't matter. Have a nice day. Diogenes said that to be free of what others think, you should drag a herring behind you. - A herring? - Everywhere you go. The advantage for me is that the herring is built-in. Moreover, I don't give a damn what others think! Louis. Please excuse him. Go on, be free. Louis! I don't give a damn what others think! Please step back so he can park. - Hello. - Did you have a good trip? Fine, thank you. - This will be quick. - Really? No one wishes to speak at the ceremony. Hello, Judith. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to call, but I couldn't. She wouldn't want you here. For Cédric, even less. It was important for me to be with them. It's not hard enough for me? They said you didn't want to speak. No. Not even one last goodbye? Why? We didn't speak when she was alive. Sometimes we regret it. You destroy a family and dare preach? Why don't you speak? For family and friends who couldn't see her, there's... There's a photo, if you want to see it. That's my shirt. Did you put it on her? She's the one who asked to wear it. It was for her birthday. I gave it to her. Thank you. We will sit in silence for several moments. - I'd like to say a few words. - Of course. Hello, I... I wish to say... I was fortunate to have known Madeleine long ago. I had a great deal of admiration for her. She was brilliant, brave... and generous. When I met Judith, Madeleine opened her arms and took me into her family. She listened to me, encouraged me, gave me advice. I was very fond of her. And I know she did for me. Then, Cédric died. Cédric had just turned seventeen. He was a happy child. His life was just starting. That day, he wanted to borrow my car. Just a quick ride. I didn't stop him. I couldn't say no. So... today I've learned that locking yourself inside an armor stops you from living. You just pretend to live. Madeleine, Cédric, and Judith... I ask for your forgiveness. Thank you. The ceremony is almost over. We will sit in silence several moments more. Excuse me. - May I? - Of course, go ahead. I'm sorry, I'm not a family member, but I would like to say a few words. Because when I look at Madeleine's coffin, I see two dates. and 2020. And in the middle, there's a hyphen. That fragile, little hyphen is a life. In the end, it's like we're all on a train together. Sometimes, we'd love to be the driver so we could stop in the stations where there's joy. And speed through the bundles of suffering. And so, maybe we could take the journey without moaning because the dining car is closed or because the ticket inspector is grumpy. We don't know where we're going. We know nothing about the destination, but we're onboard. Today, I would like to thank Madeleine and Cédric, because they made me - I know it sounds stupid - they made me more alive. Thank you, Louis. I'm sorry. Forgive me. How are you? - Your pants are open. - Shit! - I went into the house... - I understand. There you go. All taken care of. Well, well. Look who's here. You'll be thrilled. You just had to come, huh? Why are you here? She was worried. She's been worried for 37 years. Nicole was the one who was worried, so she invited me along. You just can't stop doing overtime. No, that's not it. When I called Judith about the dog, she told me everything. So yes, I was worried about you. It's true. I'm a big boy. Sort of. May I? It's better like that. Let's have a drink. Hey, pal. Enjoying yourself? You came for the buffet? Yeah, I guess so. - Are you family? - No. What's your name? Fred. - Everything okay? - Yes. Is he your brother? No. He's my friend. He has his work cut out. Maybe we should get going? What? Nothing. Subtitles: Julie Meyer
