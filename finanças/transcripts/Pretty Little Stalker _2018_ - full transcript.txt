"Purge an important connection from your past. Not everything, but just one thing. See that there's no importance to it. It's just a thing. Burn the connection and proclaim your decision. Whether it's quitting a job, grieving for a loved one, or announcing your divorce, you can do this." Burn the connection. Karen! What's all this? We need to talk. Oh, Jesus. What'd I forget to clean now? I want a divorce. I've been doing a lot of reading, and there's just so much that I want to do. And I have this whole journey ahead of me, and I can't stay here. I can't, I just can't. Aaron. Aaron, put down the gun. You've been reading, huh? Please. I buy you this mansion, I give you everything you want, and it's still not enough! It's not about the money. Shut up! Please, please, don't do this. You did this to yourself. No! "The ability to let go of hate, of judgment, of the need to control other people's hate, other people's judgment. Only then are we free to attain our happiness." These words and lessons got me through some of the hardest times in my life and to the happiest. Thanks to my loving husband and of course my son who is not here today. This too could be your family. Thank you. You did amazing, honey. - You think so? - Absolutely, right? - Kelsey? - We just hit 10,000 in sales. Yeah, you hear that? Hey, how about dinner at Le Moo. We can invite Mark, Bridget. - We'll make it a celebration. - I would love that, thank you. - Now what? - Okay, I'm going to get started. - Yeah. - Okay. Hi. - I'm a writer too. - Oh great, what do you write about? A daily blog called Maggie's Opinion, Take It or Leave It. I'm Maggie, of course, and I'm doing a profile on you. Oh, thank you, I'm flattered. Well, I tell it like it is and I have a very loyal and substantial following. Well, that's very important. What my readers want to know is what are you going to write about next? Well, I really want to dig into a parenting book. I feel like the world is evolving so much faster than parenting literature is, so... Who can I make this out to? Do we really need a parenting book from someone on their second marriage? Yeah, okay. Interview's over. We need to move the line along. It's a legitimate question. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Dodging the question speaks volumes. Gives me even more to write about. - Leave now! - No, it's okay. Thank you. I'm not dodging anything. I'm a modern woman dealing with modern problems and modern men. I even kept my last name, but I know what I want as a wife and as a mother and I act on it. Now, I'm not going to lie, it hasn't been easy, but the sooner you stand up and make a change, the better parent you become. Hear, hear. I'll send you a link. Keep the book. Hi. Well, that was fun, wasn't it? You look stunning. - Who me? - Yeah, you. - Thank you. - I was afraid it'd be the wrong size. No, it fits perfect. - I think it'd look better off. - Are you trying to seduce me? Yeah, maybe. You know, we haven't had time to get reacquainted since I got back from Africa. I would really like it if you spent more time at home. Hmm, kind of hard to write for World Travel Monthly if I'm hanging out here all the time. I know. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. You know whoever came up with that pearl of wisdom really needs to get out of the advice business. Ah well, you're the expert. Thank you. Honey, I hate to burst your bubble, but we're going to be late to dinner. We need to get a move on. Okay, you want me to get Mark? No, I will. Ah, no. I gotcha. - My turn. - Okay. I love your new house. Ah, it's all right. Oh, just all right? New house, new pool, new room. - New dad. - Oh, Harry's nice. And bossy. ¶ Bore me to sleep Although you're amazing ¶ - No, you cheated. - Yes. You didn't let me reset. How are you going to make it up to me? Umm, how about like this? ¶ It's good to be happy ¶ ¶ That's the way it feels When I'm bored ¶ Am I interrupting? - No, not at all. - No, no. Are you ready to leave for dinner? - Okay. - Okay, let's go. ¶ I don't think I can Do this for long ¶ It's okay. Mark. What's up? I got a little surprise for you. US Open tickets? It's an early birthday present. These are, these are like, incredible seats. You and me, buddy. - Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. Okay, let's go. You know, I think it was a really good turnout in the end. I, yeah, I think it was, right? Yep, except for that one woman. - Oh. - Yeah, you should have seen her. Your mother stood up to this awful woman, we'll leave it at that, and completely held her own. Wow. Hey, I was defending my family. Well, I look up to you. That's amazing. You don't have to suck up. I'm not. Look, she's brave, strong, always growing. Your mom's the coolest. Thank you, Bridget. So have you decided on a college yet? I mean, I know it's a bit early, but you know, any career choices? I'm just trying to survive. No, I understand, you're just figuring things out. - Yeah. - Hey, are you guys coming to my tennis match? - Right, when is that again? - It's on Friday. Oh, it's on Friday. Uh, what is it? It's my final book signing. Oh, but I told you a month ago. No, it's fine. It's my bad, I'll be there. - I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Honey, are you sure? Yeah, you're playing West High, right? - Yeah. - Up against the same guy? - Mmhm. - Oh, you're going to crush him. Yeah, I am. - Lorna, you sure? - Hmm? Yeah, I'll just get Kelsey to cancel it. - Excuse, use the restroom. - Okay. I'm sorry, can I just um-- Oh, oh, yeah, no, here let me, let me get that for you. Here. Thanks. You okay? Yeah, just family stuff. Are they out there? - Yeah, I'm sorry. - Aw. You know a wise man once said, "The best way to resolve any problem in the human world is for all sides to sit down and talk." Dalai Lama. Yeah, you're a smart cookie. You're so beautiful. Thanks. You look familiar, I, I don't know. Listen, everything's going to be okay. Yeah, I think I got all my crying out. - Thank you. - Yeah, no, crying is good. It's good. Oh. - See you around. - Yeah, okay. Okay. Where's my phone? Harry, wake up, wake up. - What, what, what? - Wake up. There's someone outside. - Wake up. There's something out there. - Really? Just wait here, okay? Stupid cat. What the hell? Mom? What's going on? Something is in the backyard. Harry has gone to check it out. Just stay here and be quiet. Harry? Harry! Harry, Harry? Mark, call for help! Harry? Hey, Harry, wake up. Wake up. Harry, wake up, honey. - Hey. - Hey, you okay? Yeah, yeah. I mean other than a headache and a hospital bill. Don't worry about that. I'm just glad you're safe. - Yeah, I feel pretty lucky. - Yeah. You hear anything from the police? Nothing. - Weird. - Mm. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? What? It's 4th of July. If you think anyone's touching my barbecue grill, you're crazy. You need to rest. - You going to be there? - Of course. Then I'll be just fine. Okay. Ah, I love you. ¶ Dreams, they don't Change a thing ¶ ¶ You're still like a bird With a broken wing... ¶ No, you're right. I've seen cars do like 50 along here. - Oh absolutely, and they're always on their cell phones. - Yeah, someone's kid's going to get hurt. You know, if the city is not going to add a stop sign, I'm just going to have to do it myself. How are you going to do that, Pierce? Well, Gary suggested I run for City Council and I'm warming up to the idea. Wait, seriously? Mmhm, the city's a mess. Ooh, I have a slogan for you. Time to get fierce, vote for Pierce. - Wow. - Maybe not. Well, you got my vote. But, swiss or cheddar? ¶ Something's wrong But in the dream... ¶ So what's the score now? Ten to eight, I'm winning. Oh my God, who cares? - I do. - I do. Whatever, I want to swim. Where are you going, we have a game to finish. Give it a rest, Zara. ¶ Now almost every night You come visit me ¶ Go on, go get changed. Ah, actually I might, I don't know, sit this one out. - What? - I dunno, I'm just not really feeling it. Aw, come on. Maybe I'll just dip my feet in or something. I just want you to have fun. I am have having fun, trust me. ¶ Tell her I'm okay, Tell her that I miss... ¶ Hey, Mark. ¶ Tell your little sister Don't cry ¶ Thanks, honey. ¶ It's the day of Our last night ¶ You're a little trash Santa. Thanks. ¶ In the dream it seems okay ¶ ¶ She only calls when She's feeling down ¶ ¶ Trying to find her way out ¶ ¶ It only hurts when I'm not around ¶ ¶ I'm looking for my way out ¶ ¶ She said I'm afraid... ¶ Are you okay? - Yeah, thank you. - No problem. I must have just um, hit a pothole or something back there. - I'm Mark. - Mallory. Nice to meet you, Mallory. Uh, are you new around here? Yeah, my family and I just moved in down the street. Cool, cool. Uh, I don't know what your non-crashing plans were, but we're having a barbecue out back if you want to join. Really? Yeah, I'd love to. Well, great, right this way. ¶ Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh... ¶ How long does it take to throw out the trash? Infinity, apparently. Who is that? I actually know that girl. Really? Such a beautiful day for a party. Hi. - Oh, hi. - I'm Lorna, Mark's mom. - Hi. - Hi. - You guys know each other? - Oh, yeah. Your mom found me crying in the bathroom at Le Moo and was just so sweet. - I've been looking for you. - You have? Yeah, I found this. It must have gotten mixed-up in the bathroom. My cellphone, I've been looking everywhere for this. Thank you. What was your name? Oh, Mallory. Mallory Ford. Mallory, it's nice to re-meet you. Your house is lovely, I'm jealous. - Can I ask you kind of a weird question? - Sure. Are you the Lorna Sisco, the self-help writer? - I am. - "Strive hard for the next level and it is within this regained self-awareness that we will find empathy." I'm a fan. What, you're such a sweetheart, thank you. And how do you know Mark? Uh, we met outside. I was riding my bike and I accidentally fell and Mark was kind enough to help me out and invite me to the party, so. Oh well, welcome. Enjoy yourself. Our home is your home. I'm glad I was able to get your phone back to you. See you guys in a bit. Thank you. I'm Mallory. I'm Mark's girlfriend. Hi. ¶ Her little world flashed ¶ And then I must have hit a pot hole or something and I just toppled over on my bike and Mark swooped in. It was all very gallant of him. Like something you'd see out of a John Wayne movie. How do you know who John Wayne is? YouTube, you can find anything on there. How do you know what YouTube is? What, how do you not? She seems nice. Yeah, she's cool. - I think you should apologize to Bridget. - What? I just think she feels left out. - Just do the right thing, honey. - Whatever, okay. - Thank you. - I said okay. Okay. ¶ I rise up a minute Then I fall down again ¶ ¶ Wake up in the morning To stimulate my brain ¶ ¶ The sun is shining bright ¶ ¶ I'm sure it's going to rain ¶ - Hey. - What? Ah, don't do that. I know you're upset. Yeah, I have every right to be. Why'd you even invite her? I don't know. It felt like the right thing to do. Well, you're completely ignoring me. You're right. It was completely wrong of me. True. I didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry. Can you forgive me? I guess I can this time. Come on. ¶ Always looking back And always letting go ¶ ¶ Me, I'm just a man ¶ My home. ¶ Dreams are real Dreams are owned ¶ ¶ Dreams are fear ¶ ¶ Get in it, now we're Positively dope ¶ ¶ But we still have far to go ¶ ¶ Remember when we were Lost and lost and broke ¶ What the hell? What are you doing? You almost hit Bridget! Okay, turn this car off now, young lady. Now! What are you doing? Stop that car. Get out of the car or I'm going to call the police. What the hell do you think you're-- What the hell are you doing? Oh, hi. Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry. Here. - What's going on? - Mallory cut her finger. It's okay, it's just a nick. I've survived worse. Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize anyone was home. - Oh yeah, we were just hanging out making a snack. - Oh, okay. Mallory, I've been meaning to ask you. Are you enrolling at Mark's school this fall? Um, no, I'm starting Community College. Still finishing up the transfer paperwork, so. She's really smart. - I don't think it'll be a problem. - Oh, nice. Yeah, it's funny I've barely unpacked, but I already feel like this more of my home. - Most accidents happen at home. - Yes, they do. Well, I'll let you guys get back to it. I'm sorry. Ah. Not yet. Okay. Geez, so impatient. So how's work? Uh, looks like they'll be assigning me - to tour India next month. - Again? I know, I told them I'd rather cover some place new, but apparently it's a popular destination. Well, why don't they just rerun the article you did last time? They won't do it. They want me to find a fresh new angle. You don't seem happy about it. Well, you know what it's like. I mean, if you're not inspired, it's no fun. Hmm. You could always resign. And do what? You know you'll find something here that inspires you to write about. It would mean we could spend more time together. Oh, you know, I like to stay busy. Well, more than you like to be happy? Ah, your self-help mind tricks won't work on me. You are such a nerd. Well, just think about it. Okay. You know, it's eleven o'clock, she's still here. Well, new friends aren't a bad thing. You've seen the way she looks at him? I've seen the way he looks at her. - You don't like her? - I didn't say that. You are such a bad liar. I don't know her. Well, we can try, can't we? You're right. Maybe I should invite her over for dinner tomorrow. There's no way you've seen all the episodes of Cheers. - Mmhm. - Yeah, don't most kids your age watch Pokémon or something? We didn't have cable growing up. So whatever the local channels were rerunning, that's what I'd watch. Usually something my mom chose. - Who's it from? - Oh, it's um, it's just Gene asking if I want to play tennis tomorrow. I'll talk to him later. - What about you, Mark? - About what? What's your favorite sitcom? Oh, I don't watch TV anymore. I think what he'd rather do is just surf the net all day. Um, not really, Harry. Or maybe he's just a bookworm like his mom. Oh. Is it true you can't swim? - I read it in a blog. - It is. Yeah, I saw Jaws as a kid and it just made me say no to the whole concept. That's why you don't swim? - Mmhm. - It's her only flaw. I'm curious about something. Can I ask you a question? - You can ask, it's okay. - Why did you read my book? I just, I don't have a lot of teenage readers. Um yeah, I've just... always felt more mature than other people my age and with that comes more mature problems. Self-doubt has no age limit. Did you see your mom read it? I don't know my mother. Oh, I thought you said that you were-- Stop interrogating her, Harry. It's okay. I don't really know either of my parents. They abandoned me when I was young. No, I'm sorry, that's awful. Yeah, that's horrible. Well, it's life. Your books helped me more than you'll ever know. I know I might come across as standoffish, but I'm very grateful. No, you're not standoffish. You're a strong, independent woman. You must have done something right for Mark to like you. Honestly, this bro saved my life. I feel like family. Well, you're always welcome here. Anyway, um, I hear Mark has a match coming up. Yeah, we're playing East Valley. He said you might not be able to make it. Oh no, I did have a book signing, but I canceled it. I just think it's so important for parents to spend a lot of time with their kids, teach them things. - Don't you think, Lorna? - Of course. Otherwise you end up with a kid who grows up and doesn't know how to swim. These mashed potatoes are so good. You want more? You have to stop lying to me about text messages and break up with your little girlfriend. Self-doubt has no age limit. Oh, I've got the greatest title for this chapter. "Self-doubt Doesn't Have An Age Limit." Lorna? - Hey. - Hey. Are you coming to bed? Yes, when I get to a breaking point. - You know it's after 4:00, right? - What? No, I had no idea. I'm just writing up a storm here. That's great, but you need some sleep. - I know, okay. Wait, just wait. - Just save it. - Did you save it? - Yeah, mmhm, okay. All right, come on. All right. Oh, this is nice. Oh. I love you. Oh, I love you. Thank you. What did I do to deserve this? Hey, what's wrong? They found Pierce. He was hit by a car. Is he okay? No? He's dead. Oh, this is horrible. - How is Gary? - He's awful. I'm going to go see him today and help him set everything up. I'm so sorry, I don't even know what to say. Come here. I just feel so vulnerable. Nothing's going to happen to you. Not on my watch. I love you. I love you too. Shoot, I've got to take Mark to tennis practice. Mallory already picked him up this morning. She was really putting the moves on Mark last night. I saw them kissing. She was very handsy. What? Am I being a prude? No, I just think maybe you're underestimating Mark. No, he's a good guy. He'll make the right decision. You raised him right. I did, didn't I? Yes, you did. - Hi, Bridget, nice to see you. - Is Mark home? Yeah, he's in his room. You want to come up? - If that's okay. - Yeah, come in. Mark, Bridget's here to see you. Tell her I'm busy. Well, you might want to tell her yourself because she's standing right here. - Hey. - Look, if you're busy or something I can come back another time or-- No, no, come in. Well? Doesn't look promising. Mark's fallen for Mallory. Hook, line and sinker. Ah, Mallory's a distraction. Won't last. Mark has history with Bridget. He'll come to his senses. Or not. Hey, Mark, Mark. Hey, Mark. Hey! - Mom. - Quit ignoring me. I'm not ignoring you, I was in the middle of the game. I don't care, why did Bridget just run out crying? We broke up. - You mean you dumped her? - Yeah, so? Well, it just feels like you're changing things very quickly at the moment. "The clearest action one can take is that which leaves no doubt." It's from your book. I know my own writing. Since when have you been reading my books? Mallory quotes you all the time. Clearly out of context. So, is she wrong? Are you wrong? - No. - Then what? Then, you're not allowed to talk to me this way. No more video games for a week. - What? - I love you, but actions have consequences. If you've read my book you would actually know that. - Hey, what's up? - What the hell, man, you broke up with Bridget? News travels fast. Because of the hot chick from the party? Her name is Mallory. And yeah, I like her a lot. No way, that's wild. Hey, I'm sorry, I got to go. Wait, what? Mark, hello? What are you doing here? I heard you broke up with Bridget. Yeah, how'd you hear about that? You listened and chose me. I promised you more if you broke up with her. Mark. What the hell? - Hey. - Hey, what are you doing? Nothing. Don't lie. I saw you two out there. I want to take Mallory to the US Open. Uh, but I thought we were going to go together. I thought it would be fun. The tickets are my birthday gift, right? They are, yeah. Good. I'm taking Mallory. Okay. Thanks. David! - What is it? - Something is outside the window. What are you talking about? I swear, something was like hovering out there. It was making like a humming sound. A drone? Maybe. Yeah. Honey, it's probably some kids playing peeping Tom. We should give them an eyeful. Yeah. Let's go to bed. This is my house. This will always... ...be my house. Monique. Monique? Monique? No! This is amazing. - You wrote all of this in one week? - Every word. I mean the stuff about self-doubt having no age limit, it's brilliant. It's the perfect way to expand our fan base to younger readers. We are going to make so much money. Well, you know that's not why I do this. No, I know. Which is why you need me. Just tell me one thing. When can you have it done? Soon. I feel good, I really, really do. - Fantastic. - Yeah. I'll start lining up publishers. - Thank you, Kelsey. - Hmmm. I couldn't have done this without you. I know. Now go finish your masterpiece. Okay. Hey, you've reached Harry. Leave a message after the tone. Hi, honey, I was just calling to let you know that my meeting went very well and that I love you very much, and I know that things have been hard with Pierce, but I think you and I should go on a vacation. Anyway, I'll see you soon. Okay, bye. - Woo. - Yeah! Woo, go Mark! No, it was scary. Whoever tore up that book was following me like a stalker. Maybe it was that awful woman from the book signing? Well, listen. If anything weird happens again we'll call the police, all right? Look, I'm not going to let anything happen to you. Thank you. - I love you. - I love you. Right now, let's try to have some fun. Watch Mark play, oh and by the way, he's extremely touched - that you canceled your book signing for this. - I hope so. I also hope he'll grow up and take you to the US Open like he promised. Don't say a word about that. Well, I'm smarter than I look, okay? I won't say anything. And besides isn't he in that rebellious stage where no matter what advice we give him, he's going to do the complete opposite anyway? Am I right? Pretty much. - So how did you and Mark meet? - Um, I don't know. Probably elementary school playground. - So you two have never like, dated? - Me and Mark? - You're joking, right? - She even rejected my irresistible charms. I just don't like to make assumptions. You are more my type. Just saying. Match point, Sisco. Woo hoo, yeah! Let's go, Mark! Woo, good job, baby. Good match. Mark, well done. Congratulations. - Good work. - Bro, another year of that and you're going pro. Yeah, they never even stood a chance. Hold this. Hey, hey, where are you going? - Home. - Why? Because I don't fit in. Mark, those are your friends. They don't even like me. - I don't belong here. - What? Are you blind? They want you to be with Bridget. They do not. Yes, they do. Do you not believe me? I'm sorry, I just... What do you want me to do? Be a man, choose. How about you? I don't know, if my mom saw us out here drinking, she'd probably kill me. I don't think she'd kill you. Me, probably. Hello? What are you doing? Just playing by the rules of the game. What game? Tit for tat. For every swig I take, you have to take an article of clothing off. And for every swig you take, I'll do the same. So like strip poker except with alcohol instead of cards? Bingo. Take off those pants. - Shoes first. - No, shoes don't count. Neither do socks. Mallory, it's not a strip tease. Come on, your turn. Mark, such a bad boy. Look what you're making me do. I didn't force you to do anything. Well, maybe you should. Come on, my turn. All right, off with your pants. Shoes first. No, no, shoes don't count. Neither do socks. Come on. Uh, excuse me. What's going on out here? Hi, Mrs. S. Okay, that'll be enough of that, young lady. Mark, you should know better. Okay, I think we call this a night. Besides, you've got tennis practice tomorrow. He quit. Is that true? Yeah, so what? What about the scholarship that you've been working toward? There's more to life than just tennis. I have other things I want to do with my time. Like illegally drinking and dumping Bridget? Is this what you really want or is this someone else? Mallory makes me a better person. Well, I like the person you were before she came along. Aren't you one who's always advocating for people to try new things? Experiences? I also warn people about dominating one sided relationships. You do not have to change yourself for anyone. That's not what this is. He's finally free. I think you of all people should understand that. Don't you dare quote my book again. Mom! Go wait in the car. No, you're staying here. He's not a dog. Go. What do you think you're doing? I'm making sure you know exactly how dangerous your books are. Excuse me? I mean who the hell are you to just tell people to stay away from other people? Sometimes relationships come to an end. Yeah, I read chapter eight. You are a dangerous, hypocritical, narcissist, who has no respect for a stable and secure family. I mean, what are you going to do when Harry wants something younger and tighter? I don't know who you think you are, but you are not welcome in my house again. It's getting late anyway. You should really think about swim lessons. Honey, you okay? I just caught Mallory drinking alcohol in the backyard with Mark. - They're teenagers. - No, she is a terrible influence on him. She has completely brainwashed him. You should have heard the awful things - she was just saying to me. - Honey, calm down. No, I think she just tried to push me in the pool. - Really? - You weren't there, I don't want Mallory in this house ever again. - Okay. - I'm serious. I need you to trust me. Honey, I trust you, okay? Hey. Hey. It's going to be okay. What's wrong, baby? You should be nicer to my mom. My priority is you. I want you to be free. I mean, she's my mom. Not my warden. I just don't feel safe around her, okay? She doesn't know how controlling she is. It's no wonder that your dad left her. If things get any worse you can't be afraid to trust your gut. Even if it means moving out. Well, that seems extreme. Just be careful. Hey. Hey. Listen, I wanted to apologize. Apologize? For what? The way I acted earlier. I still look at you like a little boy, but you're almost 18 and I need to adjust to that. You're free to do what you want. Thank you. But... within limits. What you're not free to do is to drink alcohol. - Understood. - Or to go out past midnight without telling me as long as you live in this house. I was only 15 minutes late-- And I'm grounding you for a week. Mom, what? My birthday party is next Saturday. Well, you're going to have to postpone it. I can't control what you do outside of this house, but Mallory is not welcome here again. She has to come to my party. Over my dead body. No wonder Dad left you. He left us. Dammit. Hey, honey. Everything all right? I messed up. Mark hates me. I feel so lost. I can't even take my own advice. Well, you only did what you thought was right. I just don't even know anymore. Well, then maybe you should listen to your own advice. What would Lorna Sisco, the great self-help guru, do in a situation like this? I would compromise with conviction. - It's his birthday. - Yeah. I mean we're still going to throw him a party and invite his friends. - Even Mallory? - No! Understood, I was just checking. Good. Something's really wrong with that girl. She's bad news. Well, sometimes boys need bad news. If he was your son, you wouldn't say that. I'm going to pretend that you didn't just say that. You did not, seriously? Yeah, it's true. You're crazy. Hey, honey. It's funny seeing you here. Yeah, it must be funny with all that laughing. Oh, Harry was just telling me this hilarious story about how he'd get drunk when he was my age. So sweet. How did this little date happen? Well, I was getting a scone after work as usual and apparently we ran into each other. Things just happen. Nice balloons. It's Mark's 18th birthday? Are you having a party? - Um, when are you coming home? - Now. Bye. Thanks for the story, Harry. Mark, where do you think you're going? Lorna, hi. We're just stepping out. Get back here, please. Tell her. Tell me what? I'm moving out. Excuse me? Don't worry, he's in good hands. You're 17. Not anymore. Don't choose someone you barely know over family. Don't you get it? He's not choosing me, he's choosing himself. Don't try to stop me, Mom. Where would you even go? I don't know, Dad's? Mark, what about your party? I'm sorry, Mom. You will lose everything. Honey, you okay? Yeah, I just had a nightmare. All right, well, just remember you got a meeting tomorrow. You should get some sleep. Yeah. No, don't tell me. Yeah, you were right. He said I can't stay here. Told me to go back to see my mom. See, this is why you can't trust anyone but yourself. I guess not. What do you want to do? I don't know. Maybe he's right. Maybe I should go back to my mom's. No way, are you kidding me? We're going to my house. Are you sure? Yeah. Don't be a wuss. Let's go. Is this your place? Yep, home, sweet home. Come on, let's go inside. Mallory, where'd you go? I'm upstairs. Come see my parent's room. Mallory, are you in here? She should be here any minute. Oh. I'm so sorry. Where have you been? I said I'm sorry. You look awful. It's a long story. You brought the new pages, right? - Of course. - Okay. Sorry for the delay. Everyone this is Lorna Sisco. - Lorna this is... - Everyone. It's very nice to meet you all. Diana was just saying you're the new voice for today's woman. Oh, thank you. It's very nice to hear that. I definitely have a lot of things I want to show you guys, so um... yeah. I don't have it. What? It's not here. Do you have a backup? At home. So, we've run into some technical issues. Looks like we may just have to reschedule. Oh, what a waste of time. In all my years, I've never seen someone who doesn't use the cloud to backup all their work. - Kelsey, I am so sorry-- - Stop. Go home. Call me when you're not such a mess. Okay, this, this can't happen again. I understand. Hey. Whatever's going on, it's going to be okay. As long as it's not another murder suicide like a year ago. No, no, no, no, it's just family problems. Talk about ironic. Sorry. Still, I'm here for you. Okay, thank you. Why is this happening? Mallory. Hello? Justin, it's me. Yeah, what do you want? I just wanted to make sure that Mark got there safe. - Mark's not here. - What? I told him to go back to you. Justin, he is your son. Don't call again. Don't-- wait-- Justin! Dammit! You. You crazy little bitch. Where is my son? I have no idea what you're talking about. Quite a temper for someone who preaches restraint. Oh, you have no idea. Where is my son? If you want to see your son, it's going to be under my terms. You are overbearing. Imagine how tragic it would be if you happened to trigger an untimely suicide attempt in such a young, vulnerable boy. What? I'm trying to protect your son. I don't want him to end up like Pierce. Why are you here? Okay. Look, but don't touch. What are those? We filed these restraining orders this morning. This is one is signed by Mark and this one is signed by me, Mallory Ford Conway. Ford is your middle name? Mark is done with you. If you come looking for us, the cops will be right on your tail. Which probably wouldn't be so great for your book sales. - You are a crazy bitch. - Yeah, I heard it the first time. You know, for a writer, you should really use a thesaurus. Goodbye, Lorna and best of luck with your family or what's left of them. - What was your name? - Oh, Mallory. Mallory Ford. Mallory Ford Conway. Conway. Why does that name ring a bell? What do you think you're doing? I'm making sure you know exactly how dangerous your books are. I don't really know either of my parents. They abandoned me when I was young. No. No, no, no. Aaron, I've been doing a lot of reading. I want a divorce. Aaron, put down the gun. Oh, you've been reading, huh? I buy you this mansion, and I give you everything you want. And it's still not enough! - It's not about the money. - Shut up! Please, please, please, don't do this. - You did this to yourself. - No! Mom, Mom! Mom! Dad, someone answer! Mom, Mom, Mom! "Announcing Your Divorce." Dammit. Hey, you've reached Harry. Leave a message after the tone. Harry, I know where Mark is and I think he's in danger. Call me. Hey, baby. Good to see that the sedative is wearing off. Where are we? Um, I told you, we're in my parent's bedroom. Oh no, that's right, concussion. Short term memory loss, blah, blah, blah. Mallory, put the gun down. Oh, it's okay, baby. I'm not going to kill you. Not yet anyway. You're such a little softie. You know, it's too bad you never had a father figure growing up. Teach you how to be a real man. We could have even been friends. That's unlikely though. So gangly. Oh my God. Mallory, put down the gun. I was wondering when you were going to show up. Weren't we? Mom! - She moved, so... - Why are you doing this? Why don't you ask your mother? Mom, how did you find us? What is going on? It's okay, it's okay. - Tell him. - Mallory, sweetheart, listen to me. I can help you, okay? You are talented and you are beautiful and smart, and you deserve an amazing life. Cut the crap. Okay, okay, okay, honey. Look at me, honey, look at me, okay? Remember the couple last year that died? Where the husband killed the wife and then he killed himself? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay. That was Mallory's parents. What? Tell him why. Because she wanted to leave him. Your mommy's book made my mommy want to leave my daddy and me, all because of something she read in a book. No. None of us would be here if it wasn't for you. Honey, you can't be mad at her for wanting to have a better life. She was leaving me too. Okay, I know. But she needed help and she was unhappy. - Unhappy? - Okay. She's dead now. I know, honey, I know, and I am so, so sorry. It is completely tragic. Mallory, I am so sorry. - I am sorry. - You're sorry? Your book sales aren't sorry. I mean, there's no such thing as bad press, is there? That never ever crossed my mind. I see you and I know what you went through. - You have no idea what I've been through. - Okay. That's why I needed to make you suffer. So you could understand exactly the pain that I go through every day. Your life is over. No! Mallory, no! You will lose everything! - Are you okay? - Mom. Fine, are you okay? - I'm fine, are you okay? - Just fine, yes, just fine. Wait, hold on, hold on. Oh, how long were you in this place? Are you all right? - I'm fine. - Okay. Okay, just wait. Wait, stop. Oh, wait honey, are you okay? - I think so. - Are you okay? You guys all right? - Dad. - You okay? It's okay. It's all right. Honey, are you okay? Hey, the police believe that the couple's been dead for a while and Mallory had been planning this for weeks. Yeah, well, we're lucky to be alive. You should have seen Mom. She was like a super hero. Yeah, she is, every day. Oh, and you, you called me Dad. Shut up. I'm just saying, right? Yeah, yeah, whatever. - I heard it too. - She heard it. Whatever. Honey, they're here. This is amazing. - Thank you. - We should celebrate. How about dinner at Le Moo? No! Any restaurant but that one. We can think of something fun to do. Yeah, maybe I could invite Bridget. Oh, how are you two? I'm working on it. - I'm proud of you. - 'Atta boy. Well, I got homework to do, so. Hey, it's going to be okay. - Promise? - I promise. She's going to be away for a very, very long time. - Come on. - Okay. ¶ We'll light it up like There's no tomorrow ¶ ¶ Hands up if you Want to be free ¶ ¶ We'll live it up like There's no tomorrow ¶ ¶ Whoa oh oh oh ¶ ¶ You say it's education ¶ ¶ It's too much regulation ¶ ¶ Let's go rave and Come follow me ¶ ¶ It's time to taste Some ecstasy ¶ ¶ We'll light it up like There's no tomorrow ¶ ¶ Hands up if you Want to be free ¶ ¶ We'll live it up like There's no tomorrow ¶ ¶ Whoa oh oh oh ¶ ¶ Na na na na na Na na na na na ¶ ¶ Na na na na na na Na na na na na ¶ ¶ Na na na na na Na na na na na ¶ ¶ Na na na na na na Na na na na na ¶
