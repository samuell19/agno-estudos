Dad, let's just drive home. Stop whining. It won't take long. What are we going to do in this place? Visiting anybody. Who? Someone who was once very dear to me. Don't be so secretive about it. I really won't let it go any further. If you want to know the name, you also need to know the story. Is that what you want? -Yes. It's a long story. -Daddy...! A very long story even. -Man! All right, then. It all happened when I was a little older than you are now. I lived here in the village with your grandparents. It was almost summer vacation and my friends and I wanted to carry out a plan... that we had been working on for weeks. The wind direction! Think of the wind direction! It blows up to 3 knots north-northwest! You aim too far to the left! Don't you have to go more to the right... -Stevie! Why don't we break down the door? You dumbass! We can't do that, it's destruction of property! Maybe we shouldn't go in at all, no one has ever done that before! Precisely. Yeaaah! Yeaaah! Yeaaah! Okay, I calculated everything. You weigh 42 kilograms, so we need to generate a power of 34 Kilowatts. This corresponds to a speed of 31.2 kilometers per hour. Did you guys make it? -That's a piece of cake! Okay, on three! -Okay. One... two... three! Class man, really Nobel Prize-worthy! Runs like the best, but uses material that falls apart! Wax your bike, man! -Even worse! That's why you have to ask for an entrance fee! And now get out of here. This is our area. This area belongs to no one! The villa has been here for 100 years, before your expensive houses ruined the area. So it belongs to the old village. It belongs to the one who is here first. IF anyone enters, then certainly not spastic newcomers. Nor should stinking villagers. -What did you say? You heard me. Oh, no... You take that back. Or else? -Or you'll get it in your jaw. Okay, I'll take it back. I don't hit girls. Who's stronger, you or me? You can kiss my ass! Who is stronger? You. And, you still don't hit girls, sissy! That's settled. Let's go! Stupid newcomer! -Nicely done. Did you hear him squeal? Everything okay Jan? See you tomorrow! Ciao! -Let's throw a stink bomb in the store! -Hi Grandma. Ciao! -Ciao! Ciao. -Ciao. Ciao. Here, you'll need it. Careful. Hello, darling. -Hi. Hello Jan. -Hey. What happened to you? He hit the fist. Had a fight? Congratulations, then you've finally done something meaningful. Encourage him a little, yes? -Ah, well. I'd rather see him fight, like a real boy... than him drawing those silly things. Was the other one much older? A boy from the ninth. Ha... finally you become a real man! We can eat. Did you call the Mullers? Yeah, it's no problem for them. What is not? -That they move in here sooner. -What do you mean? The company your father works for wants him to come sooner. We will be moving in two weeks. -In two weeks? It's also better for you. In DÃ¼sseldorf the school starts earlier and you will be there from the beginning. We were going to stay here for summer break! Those few weeks don't matter anyway. -They do. I had nice plans with Stevie and Bassie! Enjoy your meal. Two weeks from now? Man, that really sucks. Hey Jan, I heard you got beaten up by a girl! Get out of here, you little shit! What is it? Is anyone dead? Jan will move in two weeks. -That really sucks. Hurry up! Reserve our seats! Hey, intruders! Come. Do you guys want one? -No, I have one. Thanks. Keep walking! Soon those villagers will come. And my mother is waiting for dinner. -You just ate something. And you owe me 70 cents. -You'll get it. Man, you never carry money! For real! Jan, we've already tried everything, we can't get in! Before I leave... we are getting in here. Hey, you're crazy! They are charging us! Okay... Oh, man! Do you have to shoot right now? Help us out! Okay. On three, okay? One... Two... three. In the 60's, two boys were driven out of here. Yes, and in the attic must be the corpse of the tramp. Be careful now! Did the tramp live here? No, I don't think vagrants play with dinkytoys. Oh! Look how old this is! Look over there! Oh, that's cool! That's a falcon. Come on, we have to hang the sheet. What have you got there? Hey, open it! -No When those hooligans come... First we need to find a safe place. Come. The little rats are busy. Okay! What kind of map is that? I don't know, but at least this is East Germany. I don't think so, I just realized it is Bulgarian. Stop your babbling! In any case, it is secret. But what does it mean, professor? If only we could decipher ONE word. Make sure you're ready, I want to take the bookcase apart. I can do that myself! With your two left hands? Come on, hurry up. What are you doing here? Hello... is Peter home? Wait a minute! What do you want from Peter? -I came across his name somewhere. Where? The falcon drawing in the Kattler-villa. Children have no business there. Are you from around here? I come from the new neighborhood. -Then you can't know. They were Peter and the two Tanner brothers. They knew each other since kindergarten and were inseparable. And was the falcon their gang sign? If you had lived here longer, you would certainly have heard about them. And what did they do? Same thing you and your friends do: playing tricks. Remove the maypole from under the nose of the fire department. Three eleven year old boys! And during the vacation after the 4th grade they built a dam in Heroldsbach... which clogged the entire sewer system. The next day the old village was flooded knee-high. With poop? And how old is Peter now? In July he would have turned 23. Feel free to look around. It happened in the summer, after the Tanners had moved. Now 10 years ago. Afterwards I hardly recognized Peter anymore. He became very quiet, and would spend the whole day alone in his room. So that's why I was very happy when one day he... went out for a walk with his backpack. Had he made new friends? When he didn't come home in the evening, I called all the children he knew. But no one knew where he was. They searched all the forests in the area, and even dredged the rivers. I also wanted to call the Tanner's boys, if they knew anything. But in the meantime their father had taken a job abroad and they were untraceable. That was in the summer of 1971. Ever since, I don't know what happened to my son. Out there, a lot can happen to a child. Hopefully you will remember that well. Hey, what are you doing here? Go away or you'll get another beating! I go where I want. Respect, after that huge embarrassment at the villa, you have a big mouth here. Have you been there? -And what's it to you? Nothing, really. -Hey, what about the villa? Hey wuss, I'm talking to you! "The old village is a pigsty." This means war. Well, we're not getting anywhere with this. I'm fairly certain that that means 'The White Falcons'. It consists of the same number of letters. But, it's a pretty weird name for a gang, isn't it? Not so close to the screen, Bastian! I trust you not to overexert Sebastian. All right Mrs. Stork, I was a heroin addict myself for years. Sebastian has diabetes. One can die from that. You're such an asshole! Crybaby. They must have had some kind of system. Again, an E is a W, an R is an E. An O is an I. Silly me! Really, because you're not acting normal. -What's the matter? Okay, pay attention. An E and the letter next to it is a W. An R and the letter next to it is an E. An O and the letter next to it is an I. Go on. WITT... EV... ALK... AND... You're a genius, Bassie! And now the words at the caves. Okay. Jort. Oohrz. Frt, dvjszu. Frt, eroddrm, gsolrm. Come! But Stevie's parents only have to call my mother... or Jan's from Stevie or my mother from Jan... -Bassie! Bassie! Stevie's parents are away for the weekend. Nothing's going to happen, okay? Okay, we're here... and have to go down there to Scherenburg. Hm. That's 17 kilometers. Shouldn't we take the bus instead? -Hey, we're not wimps. I've read that the castle has been in ruins for 700 years, what's exciting about that? They must have drawn that map out of boredom. I don't believe that. They weren't a stupid gang of kids or whatever. No, I also believe there is a knight's treasure. Or something from the war. A pistol or a hand grenade. A hand grenade, that's cool! A hand grenade? Oh, man! Listen, if we find anything, we'll be heroes. Heroes? Thanks to a children's treasure, which children have buried? Man! What are they doing? -We have to call off the robbery. How's that? -They left with sleeping bags and everything. They're going to Scherenburg or something. -We're going to ruin that. Go get the others! -Okay. What's up with Peter anyway? Why? It's just... You went to see his mother, didn't you? You haven't told us anything yet about what she said. Nothing really. Only that he lives somewhere else. Hopefully he hasn't picked up the treasure yet. I don't think so. Have you looked at the map? -We need to head for Muggendorf. But the bridge is far away. -We'll get there before them. But, where are Carsten and Martin? They are eating an ice cream with Simone and Tatjana. Those two with makeup? What do they want with those twats? Well, kissing and all that. -Bleh! Then let them stay at home. We'll go through the fields, that's shorter. Here we can buy food. Leave that, leave that, leave that! -Good morning. Morning. -Good day! Oh. I have 1.10. -Wait... I have 1.51. Five cents, Bassie? Sure spent all your money on drugs again, huh? 2.56 for two days. How much is it? Now... open those backpacks. Why? -I want to take a look inside. We are not stealing! -First see, then believe. Because we are children? With an adult you wouldn't dare. Open up! Let's take a look. And now you. -You have no right to do that. Of course I have. -Just let him look in your backpack. But we do want an apology for this. What do we have here? What do we have here then? So, you're staying here. -Move! Stop! -Come! -Stay here, you! Run! -Stop! Stay here! -Stop! Stop! Freeze, you bastards! Quick, get out of here! Are you out of your mind? -But I have to eat something, don't I? Class, now we don't have anything to eat at all! Super plan! Why don't you ever carry money with you? Your mom's choking on the dough. I don't get my own money. Don't you get pocket money from your mom? That's really ridiculous. It's not! I would buy things that are not good for me. My mother knows what's good for me. You can decide that yourself, can't you? Other children are also sick, they are not so pampered by their mother. Because your father doesn't care about you, you can' talk about my mother like that. Ho, ho, cowboys! Guns away, yeah? This guy's gonna get us. Come! We can't go any further. -Oh no, and why not? Because he still has my backpack. What is the problem? My sleeping bag is big enough, you can fit in it. My address is in the backpack. I'll go back and apologize. Maybe he'll leave it at that. You may go ahead. Wait. We don't do that. Either the three of us go, or we don't go. Yes, but we will be in a lot of trouble at home if we continue now. So what? That's what we're getting. Come! Keep running! Now! Oh, no. -How long will it take? Bass, just a moment. You have to hold the worm above it, then the fish come up. -Okay. Soon the fish will bite my hand and I might get sick. Oh, no, man. -Quiet, there's one by my foot. Wait until I say NOW, wait a little while longer... wait a little longer and... Now! Ah! My hand! Ouch! -Sorry, Steve. My hand! Ouch! Does it really hurt? Yeah, what were you thinking? I've seen on TV how they caught fish with electricity. I just switch off the relay and 220 volts goes directly to the fence. And under negligent heat loss, and a proportional tolerance of about 10 percent... we shoot those fish 194.4 volts through their gills. Oh, shit! Sebastian, sometimes you really scare the hell out of me. Oh, nonsense. Everything is calculated. Aaah! Bassie! Bassie! Oh no! Man, that was cold. -What a dummy! Oh, look at that. I don't think they're going to walk that far, just in front of the castle. They are planning something else. -Yes, but what? We'll find out later. Come on. Oh shit, there are those villagers! Come on! Run! Move! How did they get here? I don't know! The boat! Hurry! Get out! Hurry up now! Come, we have to swim! A little further on is the bridge. But then we'll never find them again! Wait, Marie. -What's the matter? You can't just undress in front of us, right? What now? Why not? Because you're a girl. Boy, there's nothing to see, is there? Last year we went swimming in the lake as well. What's the matter? The others are meeting with twats... and you're being hysterical. All right, then we'll go to that damn bridge. Shit! Thank you. -Wo-hooo. Everything all right, Bassie? I guess that power surge wasn't so good for me. We'll just go through the woods, then we can rest, okay? Jan! Bassie! Come up quickly! Military area. Whoever goes in here gets shot. Come on guys, let's quit. We'll go around it. It can't be that big. "It can't be that big. We'll go around it.'" Man, this isn't fun anymore! Stop whimpering, Stevie! Oh no. Don't go up again! No, hey. -Come on, guys. Until the next turn. 'Until the next turn'. We've been looking for the next corner for two hours! Well, that's enough. So, do you want to give up? Jan, I really need to eat something. Yeah. And there will be a good movie on TV. Listen. If we go back now, we won't be able to leave home this long any time soon. Then we'll go back another time. I can't, Stevie. Then I'm not here anymore. What an exaggeration. Man, shut up! Jan, you can't go on by yourself, can you? Jan! Stevie, Bassie! Come quick! I found some wild apples. They are not quite ripe. But if we bake them, they might be good to eat. Clever that you only collected green wood! Those villagers can easily see us. That's only with wet wood from the ground. If you break the branches of the tree, it doesn't smoke. Old trappers trick. We really can't find them anymore. We can forget about it! Maybe you shouldn't have chosen a girl as leader after all. Old trappers trick, right? It's linked to your matches! Okay... Weapons. Okay, you guys go around. Hey, Marie. We think you are a good leader. 'Make sure that you kiss with as little spit as possible.' What are you saying? -It says so here. With photo. Ugh, that's really disgusting! -Uh! Haha. -Man, that's for puking. Sebastian my friend... I see more and more dark sides of you. Don't cry, I didn't mean it. You're crying too, right? Tear gas! Attack! Aaa... Come, we've got one. Can you give me something to eat? Something to eat? You can get hits. You will tell right now what you are doing here! Okay, punch. Aa! Next time he hits even harder. So? Go to the moon, scumbags. Aaa! Wait! We're looking for a treasure. A treasure? What treasure? From the white falcons. The white falcons, that's what my cousin told me about. They once dumped a wagonload of manure in front of the school. And they flooded the village, eight people drowned. No, nine! -The boy disappeared. What's he mean? -You never heard of the boy... who disappeared 10 years ago? The son of the black woman? -That was their leader. What?! Did you also know about Peter's disappearance? That has nothing to do with the treasure. Where's that map?! Are you deaf? Where's that map?! Huh... Quick, untie him! He's just pretending. -He's not! He must lie in a warm place, lift him up! This is a hypo, Stevie. We have to give him his shot. Like his mother showed us, come! Where's his bag? Did you take his bag?! No, I swear to God. He didn't have a bag. There's nothing here either! -Oh no. Remember what his mother said? If he doesn't get a shot within two hours, he might not wake up! Where could he have lost it? -He still had it in the store. And after that? The fish pond! You stay with him, Stevie. -I'm coming with you. -Okay. -Hurry up, The pond should be straight through here. Huh! On the board was 'life-threatening danger'. -Otherwise we'll never be back in time. Yeah, but... Uh! Ah... Could it be slower?! Who saves Bassie when we fly in the air?! You're such a pussy! It was here, wasn't it? -Yeah Over there! Okay. We have one hour and 20 minutes left. -Come on! We're just gonna make it. -At your snail's pace we were... -Stop! What's that under your foot? -Act normal! It is a hand grenade. -What? -No! You broke the safety pin. If you release the clamp, it will explode within 2 seconds. Stop it, that thing really doesn't work anymore! You don't know that. You just go to Bassie. I can manage here. I won't leave you alone. Can't you kick it away? -What? You can't pick it up, but you can easily kick it 10 meters away. Then we have to run. -I can't kick a soccer ball a meter. Don't talk. -It's real. My father played Eredivisie. He calls me totally blind. -Then he's an asshole! Please. My legs are starting to sleep. Do it now, Jan! Just a little while longer and I'll explode. Now! Uh! So that was a dud. There you are! Finally. You have to insert the needle all the way into his thigh. What are those yokels doing here? Junkie, you just got the best shot of your life. Haha. Thanks. Thank you for not leaving me alone earlier. That's okay. By the way, I think you're really good at drawing. I saw some of your drawings at school, on the wall. You will become a painter some day, or something. Ah well no! -I think so. Marie! Are you coming now? No, hey! Wake up! Stevie, Bassie! -It's the weekend. The treasure map is gone! -What?! Look what I've got here. -Did you steal the map? Out from under his nose! -Whoo, that's mean. Why? He was all right, wasn't he? Do you want those three little pests to get the treasure? They're not that bad at all. Why are you suddenly like this? Are you in love with Jan? Listen, do you want a few slaps? Come, let's go. It's really gone. What bastards. Why did you lie to us about Peter? I'm sorry. His disappearance has something to do with the treasure. -How so? I found this here. Peter's mother told me... that his friends had also moved at the time. And that he was the only one left. I think he wanted to pick up the treasure... because he felt lonely. So we're alike. I'm leaving too. -Bullshit! Are you Peter? We'll stay together. Maybe we should go back, Stevie. -What?! Bassie almost died yesterday. I'm also afraid there's something terrible in the cave. I want us to continue. Giving up now is childish. Could they be here already? Come! Is there really nothing on there? "The entrance is ten steps north of the old tree." Well, there are no old trees here. -There must be an old tree. But we searched everything. -Stop whining, we'll keep looking. We also have to look for tree stumps. They forgot that the map is very old. Maybe the tree has been cut down in the last ten years. Come, let's split up. -Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... Aaa! Shit! 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Shit. Huh! Stop, it's our treasure! I don't see a sign with: 'Private property of the spastic newcomers'! Very funny! Taking that map was very mean. We had a brief truce, afterwards everything returned to normal. Give it here. -Grab it! Uh! Uh! Ah! Ah... Whoo! Ah! Everything okay? -Of course. Look over there! Is that the treasure cave? Undiscovered caves are dangerous. We're not going in there. Well, I am! Marie, come back. Don't be stubborn! We should at least warn the others. Marie! Hey hey! Ah! Huh! Are we going any further? For my part, yes. -Well, I am anyway. And? M-mm. Me neither. Look over there! Sucks. It has collapsed in the last ten years. -Then push it. Whoo, he found the cave. Come! Wait wait wait wait. Let's not all go in there. If we wait any longer, they'll find the cave too. Come with me. Are we going back? Jan! Jan, are you there somewhere? Stevie? -Jan! Huh! Stevie, I don't trust it. How so? Move! Huh! Harder! Aaaa! Stevie, Bassie! Where are you guys? Uh... We're here. What happened? That's crazy. They were here, right? No, it's been closed for a long time. Come, we have to keep looking. Okay, on three: one, two, three! Okay, again. One, two, three! Damn thing, move it! Now move! You'll never get that thing from its place. Wait a second. I have read that many caves have two exits. We can't get rid of that damn thing either. Come, all at once. Air comes from down there, there must be an exit. Careful, Marie! -Yeah, watch out. Come have a look. This must have been a secret hideout. When enemies came, the castle people could hide here. That must have been the crest of the knights. There's something else there: 'Discovered in 1969'. 'Peter Laux.' 'Christoph Tanner.' 'Michael Tanner.' So that's how they got their name. -But where is the treasure now? The cave is the treasure, Stevie. How can a cave be a treasure? This is where the White Falcons were founded. Surely there must be an exit here somewhere? Whaa! -What is it? That's Peter, right? He's dead. He's really dead. He came here because he missed his friends so much. And then he died. All alone. I'm so sick that I'm moving! Jan. I've said it before, everything stays the way it is. Nothing stays as it is. Jan, my flashlight is getting weaker. -Shall we look for the exit? The air comes from underneath. That was at least ten meters. -Holy shit! You can't see what's down there at all. We can't get out of here. We have to jump. -What?! Jan, that's ten meters! I know. That's where the air comes from, maybe the water is the exit. But maybe it's just a small pond! Or big pointed rocks! Yes, let's wait for help to arrive. We are 15 meters underground, they will never find us! I don't jump ten meters if I don't know what to expect, I don't even jump five meters! What do we do then? Wait here until the batteries are dead? Peter also waited and he was alone in the dark. But Peter wasn't a coward, was he? And he didn't jump either. Maybe he didn't want to go back home. But I want to go back. I'll jump first. Then we know what's down there. On three, okay? -Okay. Okay. One. Two. Three! Everything okay? -I think so. Where's Bassie? Bassie! Bassie! Bassie! Shall we jump again? Come, underneath I see light. -Come on! Hey, Jan. I don't know anyone as brave as you. Where the hell are you guys? Man, if we don't find them soon, we're gonna have to get an adult. Let go of her! Let go of her right now! -We're not holding her, stupid monkey! What the hell are you doing? Why are you so wet? -We fell into the treasure cave. The treasure cave? Where? There's nothing, just some old dirty stuff. Nothing else. They can have them. -Didn't I say that straight away? That map is fake. And that's why they get a beating now! -Not today. Come, let's go. Don't think we're friends now! Next week there will be blood flowing! Yeah, yeah. Should we call the newspaper and say we found the missing boy? No, let it be, Stevie. -Why not? Didn't we want to be heroes? And now we are. Come. Oh guys, we're gonna get our asses kicked! -So what? The guy was so stupid, he probably didn't find the address. You know, adults are stupid by nature. So, my dear Kokoschinski! Where have you been? Dad, don't panic on the Titanic. There is no panic, but you will panic! You will be in a panic the whole vacation, mister! Bassie, I thought you were at Stevie's house! And then a man calls that you are in the wilderness and have stolen! Your good friends must have coaxed you. I wanted to call the police! My God, what is that? If that's going to inflame! We have to go to the hospital! -Mommy! That's not gonna kill me! Say, sportsman, your parents are waiting for you too. Go home! What are you doing here again? Oh God! Jan, finally! I've been so worried. You guys did make a mess, huh? Hello. I'm listening. Well! Why am I so worked up? What kind of heroic deed did the three of you do? We left yesterday morning, walked for miles through the wilderness. I committed theft and entered a restricted military area. And we were trapped in a cave. And this here, that wasn't a boy. That was a girl. I know I'm not what you want me to be. But there's nothing I can do about that. So now you can punish me. Three months no TV and no pocket money is quite reasonable, isn't it? And what's more, you're now helping me take apart all the furniture in the house. Where was I again? Oh, yeah, right: we'll get a box, okay? And we'll drill air holes in it. And then we ship ourselves to America. I have calculated everything. If we save our pocket money every month and put aside 2.32 euros... then together we will have the shipping costs next summer. Quite a good plan, isn't it? -Super plan, Stevie. I have to go now. Good luck, Jan. Yes, exactly. And behave yourself, yeah? I will. Hello sissy. -Hey, tough peasant girl. I wanted to make sure we were really rid of you. So, will you come back for the holidays? I don't know yet. Why is that? -Oh, just. Well. If so, you can give it back to me. When I went back a year later to visit Stevie and Bassie, Marie didn't live there anymore. Her parents had sold the farm and moved to the city. I never saw Marie again. But I still often think about her and everything that happened that summer. I wish I could have met Peter once. I had a lot to tell him. But above all that you don't have to be afraid of the future. There you go. What's that over there? That. That wasn't here the other day. Marie didn't forget the White Falcons either. Let's get going. Your mother's waiting. -Okay. Mrs. Bumblebee. Baron Bumblebee Hat! Not here! We're in a graveyard, yeah? Exactly, Daddy. Behave yourself! Subtitles by DS
