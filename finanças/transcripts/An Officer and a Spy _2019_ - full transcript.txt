Soldiers! Present arms! Commence! "In the name of the French people, the first War Council of the military government of Paris on December 22, 1894 found Dreyfus Alfred, Captain of the 14th Artillery Regiment, staff trainee, guilty of high treason. It therefore condemns him to be deported to a fortified place, and to military degradation." Alfred Dreyfus, you are no longer worthy to bear arms. In the name of the French people, we degrade you. Soldiers! They degrade an innocent man! They dishonour an innocent man! Long live France! - Long live the army! - To death! - To death! - Traitor! - To death! - Death to the Jew! You're a traitor! Picquart, how does he look? Like a Jewish tailor, crying over the gold he lost. Kill the traitor! To death! - Coward! - To death! Damn you! - To death! - Damn you, traitor! - To death! - Traitor! I am innocent! The Romans threw the Christians to the lions, we the Jews. We progress. What was the mood at the end of the ceremony? As if a healthy body had been purged of a plague and life would resume its course. Too bad, the Minister of War cannot assist in these events. - Am I being sued? - No, Minister. It doesn't matter. You did well. We were impressed with your conduct. Right, Boisdeffre? Indeed. Colonel Sandherr witnessed the ceremony? - He was there, General. - His tremors? He could control them. His condition won't improve. You will replace him. With all due respect, I don't have experience in the secret service. You'll have to acquire it. The punishment given to Dreyfus will show the world how we treat traitors. I want to send him to a place where he has no one to talk to. - The penal colony of Cayenne? - No, better yet. A deserted rock where he'll be alone, Devil's Island. Are they still talking about that damn Jew? Picquart. You knew him, didn't you? - Sorry, who? - Dreyfus. He was my student at the War College. - They treat him like that because he's Jewish? - Yes. I am a lawyer. A Catholic officer would have had a fair trial. Do you agree, Picquart? He was denied due process on matters of national security that could not be disclosed, but the evidence against him was not lacking. I forgot! With Philippe I discovered an alsacian restaurant in Rue Marbeuf. - Wonderful. - Great restaurant. I'll prove it. - Major! - Captain. Major, did I do something to offend you? No. You're the only professor who gave me a bad grade. Perhaps I don't value your skills as much as you do. Not because I'm Jewish? I'm careful that sentiment doesn't affect my judgment. If you have to be careful, it's a plausible hypothesis. If you're asking me if I appreciate Jews, my answer is no. If you're implying that I have a discriminating attitude I assure you I don't. Never. It was a beautiful day. Are you tired? A little, but I had a great time. - Georges, I'll help you. - Come on, darling. He's going to Brussels on Wednesday. - Can you come? - Yes. Do you ever feel guilty? - He's not my husband. - You know what I mean. Why guilty? You were with me before he showed up. I don't understand why you married him. He asked me. You don't. You think he knows about us? No. - Why? - If he knew, he'd kill me. - Are you sure he's in Brussels? - That's what he said. - Who is it? - Telegram. - Major Picquart? - Yes. Thank you. - It's from General Gonse. - Who is he? He's the head of the Secret Service. - He wants to see me in the morning. - Darling! Are you in trouble? I prayed that this day would never come. Colonel Sandherr can no longer head the Statistics section. I'm sorry to hear that. From now on, you will take his place. You will be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. That makes you the youngest Colonel in the army. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Keep me in the loop. Understand, young man? I hate surprises. Major Henry will show you the offices. Did he expect to get this assignment? My God, no! Too crude. His wife's father is a landlord, I think. - You're not married? - No, General. - Is there a reason? - No. Is there anything that could expose you to blackmail? No. I have to ask, you understand. Major Henry, come in. - General. - Colonel Picquart will head the Statistics section. - Welcome him. - Certainly, General. Colonel. Here we go. - I thought it was uninhabited. - Nobody's bothering us here. I don't doubt it. Bachir! Good morning, Major. Colonel Picquart takes command of the section. Bachir knows every secret here. - Is that so? - Yes. What's all this racket? You can hear it from the street. Stop it! Police officers, informants. They're useful. Colonel Sandherr made them stay here to check them out. - What's that smell? - Tell me about it, the sewers. The whole neighborhood stinks. Meet Captains Junck and Valdant. - What are they doing? - Checking the correspondence. Valdant uses the dry method, Junck uses steam. - Are these private letters? - Not anymore. At ease, Captain. You remember Captain Lauth of the Dreyfus affair. Colonel Picquart is the new chief. What are you doing? I'll tell you later. You may also remember Gribelin, the archivist. Colonel Picquart replaces Sandherr. You have a lot of files. All right, carry on. Here's the telephone and here's my office. No secretaries, the Colonel didn't trust them. This was his office. - So now it's mine. - We'll have to get used to it. Here are your keys. Entrance, office, drawer, safe. Thank you. What was Lauth working on? Recomposing the correspondence of the German military attaché. - Colonel Schwartzkoppen. - Private letters? Yes. - Does the Minister know about this? - Certainly. We follow his stories with pleasure. He's been having an affair for years. - Is that so strange? - Yes, it is. He's mad at the Italian military attaché, Major Panizzardi. Good gracious! How do we get his letters? Come on, I'm the section chief. The cleaning lady at the German Embassy, Marie Bastian. Every week she delivers us the contents of the garbage can. They are important documents, not just affected notes. Remember this? - Dreyfus' note. - It was in six pieces. Lauth glued them together and removed the tear marks. So you can't tell where it came from. Without this, we wouldn't have caught him. Good job. We framed it for Sandherr when they demoted the traitor. Good. Thank you, Major. - I think we'll get along just fine. - Thank you, Colonel. I hope so. "I send you some interesting information. A note on the hydraulic brake of the 120 and its functioning. A note on the cover troops. One on the changes to artillery units. The Artillery Field Manual, Firing. March 1894." May I? We recovered this one week ago at the German Embassy. - Where are the documents mentioned? - Probably in Berlin. Who's the spy? What does the note say? He's an artillery officer. He served in all four departments of the Joint Chiefs. The only ones to have done this are your students at the War College. - I'm surprised there's a traitor. - One of them is. We'd like a sample of each officer's handwriting - who carried out this rotation. - Certainly. The gunners who served in the four departments. Souriau. Gaston. Corbin. Dreyfus. Etienne. Dreyfus... - The Jew? - He's the only Jew among them. Could it be him? It may very well be him. Better show it to Du Paty. Major Du Paty? Is he in charge of this? Yes, Major Du Paty is a passionate investigator. Picquart, get Dreyfus in here. Henry, hide behind the map. I'll pretend I hurt my finger. I'll ask him to write a letter that I will dictate to him. Cochefert, you and your colleague be seated. Take the chair. You'll be sitting here to make the arrest. Gribelin, take notes. So... When he confesses... I'll propose to him to accept the only honourable solution. - He's at the entrance. - Picquart, go. Get in position. Good luck gentlemen. - Good morning, Major. - Captain. Forgive my attire. I'm called to a meeting of the Joint Chiefs. - "In bourgeois clothes." - Exactly. What a relief! - I thought it was a joke. - It's not a joke. I'll come with you. - Don't bother. - I insist. It's very quiet, isn't it? Good. Now I have to say goodbye. Goodbye, Major. Enter. - Mrs. Sandherr? - Yes. I am Colonel Picquart, your husband's successor. You have his job. What do you want? - Leave us alone. - Who is it? - Picquart. - I summoned him. Send him in. - Good morning, Colonel. - Come closer, Picquart. I have a few things that will come in handy. In the desk, down there. There's something you must have. Down there. The bag, open it. Secret funds, 48,000 francs. It's yours now. In the middle drawer of the desk is a folder. You see it? Yes, it's here. - Who are they? - People suspected of treason. People to arrest in case of war. - All of them? - Yes, 2,500 names. Gribelin has the master list. A hundred thousand foreigners to arrest. - Good gracious! - That's not all, there are no Jews. My wife says it's shameful to retire. But I'm happy to be forgotten. When I see so many foreigners around me I notice the degeneration of the our moral and artistic values. Then I realize I cannot recognize France. - I will try to protect the country. - Go ahead, for what's left of it! Colonel. Good day, Bachir. - Good day, Colonel. - Sorry to disturb you. Major Henry! A word, if you please. Colonel. You're early. - Some changes will have to be made. - Changes? I don't want these shady types in here. We'll replace the passes. - And Bachir is exasperating. - You're getting rid of Bachir? He'll get another assignment. Meantime, let's get a doorbell. - Very well, Colonel. - What's in the bag? Marie Bastian's lastest delivery. - From when? - Last night. She leaves it at a church near my house. - You take it home? - It's just my wife and me. That's not why. Documents like that need to be brought here right away. I'll keep them in the safe. I'll decide which leads to follow and to whom to entrust the task. Sandherr was happy with my work. Sandherr is consumed by syphilis. He is paralysed and brain damaged. That'll be all. Very well, Colonel. One last thing. I will pick up the next delivery myself. - Well? - It's a telegram. "I look forward to a more detailed explanation than the one you gave me the other day on the outstanding issue. Please give it to me in writing to see if I can continue my..." - My...? - "my relationship. My relationship with the house of R." He didn't send it. There's the address on the back. "Mr. Major Esterhazy. Rue de la Bienfaisance. Walsin Esterhazy, 74th Infantry Regiment stationed in Rouen." Rouen. "The house of R." Is there another traitor? I want a list of more trustworthy inspectors, someone discreet. - I'll ask Major Henry. - No. It'll stay between us. For now we won't tell anyone about this. - Colonel Picquart? - Yes. - Jean Alfred Desvernine of security. - Perfect. I have an assignment for you, a delicate matter. There's a name inside. I want to know everything about him. How he lives, who he hangs out with. Particularly if he has relations with the German Embassy. It's a delicate matter. Don't come to the ministry. - How long will you need? - Give me a week. - "Apollo." Is that Greek? - No, it's a Roman copy. - The original is lost. - You mean it's a fake. No, it's a copy. It's different. - I'd rather have told you myself. - It doesn't matter. I asked Lauth not to tell anyone. - Maybe nobody believes me. - Who says otherwise? - Can I give you some advice? - Certainly. Newcomers think that the first suspect they meet is a great spy. Esterhazy is stuck in Rouen, he doesn't have access to confidential material. He's small fry. Judging from this, Schwartzkoppen also doesn't consider it. Keep an eye on him, but don't waste too much time on it. Thanks for the advice. There he is. - I'm assuming it's not the wife. - No. Marguerite Pays, prostitute, 26 years old. - She's known as Four Finger Margaret. - You're joking. No. He settled her in an apartment in Montmartre. I thought he was stationed in Rouen. - He never goes there. - Never? A curious detail. He always enrolled in artillery classes. But he's not in the artillery. We'd better get going. What's the next move? Opposite the German Embassy is a building. There's an empty apartment for rent. The Germans use the ground floor as a canteen for officers. We should get some material over there. It'll be risky and expensive. - Isn't it enough to follow Esterhazy? - You've seen him, he's cunning. He'd know right away. - Rent the apartment. - Yes. - Good day. - Colonel. Schwartzkoppen is with Panizzardi, the Italian military attaché. You come at just the right time. Here's Schwartzkoppen. Here is Panizzardi Alessandro. He's a handsome young man. The Ambassador, Count Munster... and diplomats and officers that we haven't identified yet. - Isn't Esterhazy there? - No. Colonel, they're leaving. My God! They're in love. Gentlemen, what you are about to see is secret. Our cannons were firing two rounds per minute. Today I present to you Cannon 75. It has a hydropneumatic brake that absorbs the energy of the shot. This avoids recalculating the aim after the hit. - So the firing rate has increased tenfold. - Gunners, to your stations! For a 12-shot. Load up. - Loader ready. - Shooter ready. Fire! If the Germans come back we will give them a warm welcome. To the 75! Colonel Picquart? - Yes. - Colonel Foucault. I'm the military attaché in Berlin. Do you have a moment? Yes. - It will play a decisive role in battle. - I'm sure. You know about the infiltrator in the German secret service? - Cuers? - Cuers. He says the Germans have a spy in our army. - Did he mention a name? - He doesn't know. He's 50 years old and commands a battalion. For two years he's been passing second-rate information especially about artillery. I wanted to fill you in. Thanks, I'll take care of it. A toast is in order. - Cheers! - Here's to us. Well? What's so urgent? - Interesting. - It's interesting what he's holding. - A cane? - No, this. - How long between the two pictures? - Twelve minutes. - He takes no precautions. - He doesn't care. My goodness, what they get up to nowadays! - What does General Gonse say? - I haven't told him yet. - Why? - I wanted to restrict it to a limited circle of people. - I would like to inform the minister. - Why? War Secretary Billot asked to warn him about things - that might create political problems. - All right, you can talk to him about it. But be discreet. I don't want another Dreyfus scandal. Esterhazy... Esterhazy... That name sounds familiar. Have you met him? Evokes memories in my old head. Minister. Consult the registers about... What's the name? Marie Charles Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy, 74th Infantry. - How will you proceed? - It's not easy. Except for the pictures, we have an unsent telegram and unusable chatter of an agent in Berlin. So... You need to find the evidence. - Shall we open an inquiry? - Sure. Boisdeffre doesn't want more Dreyfus scandals. The scandal is not to punish him. Minister, Esterhazy has written twice this summer. Well, look at that! "I request a transfer from Rouen to the General Staff of Paris." - The impudence! - He wants to discover secrets - and make a lot of money. Can I have them? - Yes. Thank you. Name and occupation. Alphonse Bertillon, head of the Judicial Identity Service. You are a handwriting expert. You compared the note addressed to the foreign embassy - with the defendant's handwriting. - Yes. You have no doubt that they are written by the same person. I have no doubt. There are similarities, but also many differences. The O's, the double S's. - You say so yourself. - Yes, but they're deliberate. It's a self-forgery operation. The note was written on extremely thin paper. Like this one. You don't write letters on paper like this. It allows... I'm sorry, may I? Allows to have perfect transparency. So to use a model under which I could copy it. There is one word in particular. That's the word "interest." I've reproduced it with a five millimetre grid and a 12.5 millimeter template. Notice the overlapping edges. It's an overlapping of letters by 1.25 millimeter. Here we see an even more detailed enlargement of the word. What do we notice? Every time you see a discrepancy. The difference is 1.25 millimeters. It's impossible for a hand which performs natural handwriting to reproduce an identical track. It's a case of one in a million. So I say that Dreyfus forged the handwriting in case it would be discovered... You're saying I am guilty because the handwriting is mine. Yes. But I'm equally guilty if the handwriting isn't mine. Yes. Major, what will you tell the minister? The chances of conviction are not more than 50%. Why? What motive could he have? It can't be money. His personal resources are 20 times a captain's pay. You haven't found a motive. You should see the evidence we have against that Jew. In a letter, an officer calls him "that scumbag D." - "Scoundrel D." Then use it. - Betray our secret source? - They are closed hearings. - Dreyfus and his lawyer are here. What if I describe the contents of our files in court? You've already given your statement. - If you spoke to the President of the Court? - With all due respect, I'm here to observe, not to intervene. Then I'll take care of it. The Court has been informed that your deposition was incomplete. I didn't want to reveal any secret information. - Now you can reveal it. - If the court insists, I will. In March, a highly respected person... An extremely estimable person informed us of a traitor who was transmitting secrets to a foreign power. In June, he reiterated the report in a more precise fashion. Carry on, Major. The traitor he named is that man. Stay calm. - Do you swear this is true? - I swear. The statement has no value without the witness. Can you state the name? - Impossible. - Secrets are well guarded here. An officer has secrets that not even his kepi knows. Major Henry concluded the deposition thus. Was it decisive? - It certainly was spectacular. - But not decisive. He was speaking from hearsay. The Statistics section has a file containing evidence against Dreyfus. According to them, the judges should see it. I agree. Of course Dreyfus and his lawyer can't see it. - It will be reserved for judges. - That's a breach of procedure. Theoretically, yes, but it's vital that the judges see it. In the name of truth and justice. You understand, Major Picquart? Mr. Minister. Colonel. "In the name of the French people, The first War Council of the military government of Paris has issued the following judgment. Today, December 22, 1894, the first War Council of Paris, having heard the indictments and conclusions of the government commissioner, declares the defendant Dreyfus Alfred, Captain of the 14th Artillery Regiment, intern at the Joint Chiefs, guilty as charged. In 1894 he passed on to agents of a foreign power classified or confidential documents regarding national defense. He also exchanged information with this power to provide such power with the means to perform hostile acts." I thought you'd forgotten about me. - Because you forgot me. - Absolutely not. Philippe won't be back tonight. - Remember? - Of course, my dear. I've been thinking about it for weeks. - I'll make you dinner. - You're kind. "What a horrible nightmare I've been living for almost two years, my dear Lucie. The guards are forbidden to speak to me. The days go by without me talking to anyone. The isolation is such that it feels like I am buried alive. If it were just for me, I would have already slipped into the grave. But it's not just about my life, but my honor, the honor of us all, of our children's lives. Lately they've been grilling me every night. I don't know why. It's not a precautionary measure. It's a form of hatred. It's a kind of torture." Georges! Sorry, I couldn't sleep. - How long have you been there? - Quite a while. Are those letters? Love letters? It doesn't matter. I can't hope for fidelity. It's nothing, I assure you. - Is it just work? - Yes, it's just work. Hurry up. Fifteen, Eight. Sir. - Colonel Picquart. - Bertillon. I replaced Sandherr at the Statistics section. I know. What can I do for you? I have these papers. I'd like to know what you think. - I never give an immediate opinion. - Maybe in this case you will. Yes, it looks the same. Yes. Of course! It's the same, yes. Well? Are they the same? The handwriting is identical to the note of Dreyfus. Would you be willing to state that in writing? Of course, if you wish. What if I told you that this wasn't written by Dreyfus? I'd say that the Jews have taught someone to write with the handwriting of Dreyfus. I want to see the Dreyfus file. - Major Henry has it. - He is on leave. Indeed. Then give it to me. Won't you wait for the major to return? Why are you questioning my orders? Find the file. - Is that all? - Yes. The War Council hasn't touched it since. "My dear friend... I enclose twelve guiding plans for Nice that that scumbag D gave to me for you. He said he'll do his best to please you. Alexandrine? Don't fuck too much." I'd like to talk to you. - Is it urgent? - If it's not too much trouble. Leave us. - Thank you for your time. - Always a pleasure, Picquart. But I'm busy with the preparations for the Tsar's visit. What's so urgent? The case I told you about days ago. Major Esterhazy. Esterhazy? Can I make some room? - Sure. - Thank you. You know these already. Goodness gracious! What is all this? We have a serious problem, General. The sooner we solve it, the better. Esterhazy wrote to get a transfer. I got them from the minister. I noticed the resemblance of the handwriting with the document which has proven Dreyfus guilty. I showed them to Bertillon, the graphologist. - Remember? - Yes. It confirms that the handwriting is identical. I've reviewed the secret file of the evidence provided to the judges who presided over the court-martial. No, wait. - The secret file still exists? - Yes, here it is. I was surprised by the fragility of this evidence. Only one letter alludes to Dreyfus and it also has the initial "D." All this should have been destroyed. Mercier had told Sandherr to get rid of it after the trial. He didn't. But perhaps the main problem is not the existence of the file. What are you saying? It's the note, the handwriting. Dreyfus is innocent. Go to General Gonse. He's the head of the secret service. You should have turned to him from the start. Indeed, General. But in the interest of the army we must act now. I know what the army's interest is. Inform General Gonse. He's in his country house on leave. General. Captain! I thought I made myself clear. I don't want another Dreyfus affair. This is not another Dreyfus affair, it's the same one. Picquart! - Welcome to the countryside. - General. What brings you here? Come on. Shall we go? So we haven't arrested the real culprit. I'm afraid not. The note could only have been written by an artillery officer who knows the four departments. It can't be Esterhazy. It's Dreyfus. That was our mistake from the start. If you look closely, you'll find they were just notes. One about the cannon, one about the troops and one about Madagascar. They weren't official documents. No, thank you. It was a bunch of gossip by a man thirsty for money. It's not Dreyfus, it's Esterhazy. I can make a suggestion, dear Picquart? Please do. Forget the note. - I beg your pardon? - Investigate Esterhazy, if you will. - But leave out the note. - It's the evidence against Esterhazy. A war council has decided who wrote it. The case is closed. And if we found out that Esterhazy is the traitor? We won't find out. The case is closed for the reason I just mentioned. We want it closed. But the Dreyfus family doesn't accept it. One leak and they'll accuse the army of having concealed the truth. What do you propose? - Put Dreyfus on trial again. - Another trial? - Are you crazy? - Is that inconceivable? Of course. Everyone would wonder why such a mistake has been made! They'll get at the secret file. It's unthinkable. Why? It would embarrass us! I don't understand you. We know your opinion about the chosen race. What do you care if a Jew is being held on an island? He's innocent. How sentimental you are! Lambs, newborn kittens and Dreyfus. They're all innocent. You talk as if I feel affection for him, but it's not like that. I'd rather he was guilty, but the traitor is Esterhazy. Maybe it's Esterhazy or maybe not. If you don't say anything, no one will ever know. That's an abominable suggestion. Should I take this secret to the grave? Of course! That is the essence of our profession. I have nothing more to add on the matter. Don't bring up Dreyfus. That's an order. Enter. - Colonel, I'm leaving. - Good night. - I will lock the doors. - Leave the keys, I'll do it. - Se volete, posso restare. - Non c'è bisogno. Lasciate le chiavi. "The request... I got myself a cartridge for the Lebel rifle. Dubois. My dear sodomite, I saw Mr. Dubois this morning. We need to meet today." Find anything interesting? - Who's Dubois? - Jacques Dubois. He works in a printing house at the service of the War Ministry. So Schwartzkoppen's note that you said makes allusion to Dreyfus "I enclose twelve guiding plans for Nice that that scumbag D gave to me for you." is actually hinting at Dubois? - Maybe. - What do you mean "maybe"? Who could provide better plans for Nice? Dreyfus? Or Dubois who knows the German and Italian military personnel? And this? It's your handwriting. Here you declare to the judges that a Spanish military attaché told you that there was a traitor in the Joint Chiefs. That's right. "The Germans have an officer informing them. Find him, Henry. If I knew the name, I would tell you." Come on! How can that come from the mouth of a Spanish marquis? I paraphrased. So if I asked the Marquis if he said those things, - would he confirm it? - No, he'd lie like everybody else. Stop it, this file is fake. Have you told General Gonse about this? - I told him Dreyfus is innocent. - What did he say? - He said to let it go. - Then let it go. They're the bosses. We execute orders or we're nothing. I don't know if Dreyfus is innocent and I don't give a damn. If you order me to kill, I will. If you then tell me it was the wrong person, it will grieve me. But it's not my fault, it's the army. Maybe it's your army, but it's not mine. Good night, Major. Good night. Colonel. - That's a great idea. - I'll do what I can. - Don't compromise the source. - They won't know anything. You took your time! - Did we have an appointment? - No, we didn't. - I stopped by. - You've never done this before. I should have done it more often. It's a small, very quiet section. - Where's the Dreyfus file? - In the safe. Be nice, give it to me. Thank you. From now on if you don't have any objections, I'll take care of it. - May I know why? - No. - Is it all there? - Of course it is. - Do you have copies? - No. Good. Major Henry will deliver Mrs. Bastian's material to me. You can change the procedure, not the facts. It is normal that it is delivered to the head of the secret service. - Goodbye. - General. You look lovely. Where is Philippe? A crisis at the ministry. He'll be here for the second part. What happened to you? We haven't seen you in a long time. The Colonel doesn't see any of us anymore. - He attends other spheres. - No. No champagne? Then it's serious. - What's the matter, Georges? - Your husband's here. Forgive me for being late, but it was a state business. Picquart, I'm glad to see you. I don't suppose you have read the paper. Look, the copy of the Dreyfus note. We can finally see him. Damned reporters! - Is it important? - Yes, it is. A few heads will roll for sure. "The evidence. The copy of the ntoe written by Dreyfus." Colonel, you command a ship that travels everywhere. You're right, it's an outrageous violation of state secrets. This doesn't stop here. We have an anonymous letter. It warns us that Esterhazy will be reported to the Chamber of Deputies as Dreyfus' accomplice. What do you think? I'm dismayed, but... Someone's trying to sabotage my investigation. - Picquart! - Control yourselves. This is an intolerable accusation! Are you obsessed with the idea to replace Dreyfus with Esterhazy? Nothing will stop you. I should arrest you for gross negligence! This is a bad situation, Picquart. You disappoint me. I haven't told anyone about the investigation and I'm not obsessed. I have a lead on Esterhazy. What would you do if you had proof that Dreyfus was a spy? If it was assured, I'd accept it. But there is no such proof. We intercepted a recent letter of Major Panizzardi to Colonel Schwartzkoppen. Here's the passage we're interested in. "I read that a congressman is going to officially question Dreyfus. If in Rome they should ask me for explanations, I'll say that I never had any relationship with that Jew, of course. If they ask you, you'll say the same. No one can ever know what happened to him. So... what do you say? - Can I see? - No. When did it arrive? Major Henry received it two weeks ago. I expect you don't doubt Major Henry's integrity. If you are certain that the document is authentic, I won't do it. - You admit Dreyfus is guilty? - If the document is genuine, yes. Given your state of service we won't take any disciplinary action against you. However, we demand that you entrust us with the documents of your investigation into Esterhazy. You will leave Paris and begin a tour of inspection of the safety measures in the Eastern garrisons. - You're removing me forever? - No, you'll only be gone a few days. Mister? Who are you looking for? - Lawyer Leblois. - I've seen you before. You are Colonel Picquart. Excuse me. - Georges! - Good day, Martha. Come on in. Don't you eat in the army? In Africa the worst thing is the food. I've missed the French cuisine. It was delicious. Thank you. - You want to stay here? - If I can. Just for one night. You don't have the apartment anymore? - I don't want to go there. - Why not? - I'm afraid it's being watched. - By who? You see those two? They're plainclothes cops. How do you know that? They worked for me. The generals understood that I wouldn't keep quiet. So they sent me on an inspection at the Somme, then Nice. Later in Marseille, Algiers and Tunisia. I didn't even have time to stop at my house. - I ended up in an African regiment. - You could have told us. They intercept my correspondence and I'm being followed. Last week they wanted to send me to Tripoli. A suicide mission. My God! So I realized I had to come back to Paris at any cost. - Can you prove any of this? - Of course. You have to make it public. It's hard for me, you know. Since I was 18, the army is my life. - I'd like to avoid a scandal. - But it's already a scandal. - One question! - Do you think Dreyfus is innocent? Major Esterhazy says that you work for the Jews. I am General de Pellieux, I command the Seine department. I've been tasked to investigate the evidence you have collected regarding Major Esterhazy. - Do you understand? - Yes, General. - Do you recognize this? - Yes. It's the telegram written to Esterhazy that Schwartzkoppen never sent. Who gave it to Captain Lauth to put it back together? I did. There's no evidence it came from the embassy. - You may have added it to the papers. - Yes, but I didn't. Did you know it was forged? They canceled the address and added Esterhazy's name. That happened after I left. - You faked it. - Why would I do that? You work for a Jewish union that wants Dreyfus released. You manufactured the evidence to blame Esterhazy. No need. The note is proof of his guilt. Yes, the note! I'm glad you mention it. - Did you send a copy to "Le Matin"? - No. - Did you give information to the press? - No. Did you speak to Leblois about the Esterhazy investigation? - Yes, but I can explain. - You don't have to. Disclosing confidential information is a crime. Leblois told a member of the Senate who reported to the government. - I don't know how it got to the press. - You have no idea! How much information did you reveal to Mrs. Monnier? Mrs. Monnier? The wife of Philippe Monnier of Foreign Affairs. - It's not about her. - That is not for you to judge. Do you recognize these? They are personal letters stolen from my house! - It proves the connection with the lady. - You searched my apartment! Esterhazy saw some documents of your investigation into him. Kept in the house. He got them from a woman wearing a veil. - We think it's Mrs. Monnier. - Was she wearing a veil? - This is no laughing matter. - It's a low-level melodrama. - Can we talk about essential facts? - Don't be impertinent. Esterhazy's handwriting is identical to that on the note. We are investigating you! The Dreyfus file contained false evidence. It's not relevant. - Am I under arrest? - Not yet. Forgive me, but your investigation is a farce and I don't want any part of it. Have a seat. We're not done. Colonel. Colonel! Thank you. Here, drink this. They told Philippe. I knew he'd react violently if he had known. After that general... - Pellieux? - Yes, him. When they were done questioning me, they drove me back in a carriage. Philippe was waiting for me. He sent the girls to his sister. He said I'm not worthy to be a mother. He won't let me see them after the divorce. Can he really do that? No, certainly not. You need a lawyer. We'll ask Leblois. Then you'll leave Paris for a while. - Why? - To avoid the press. Do you have somewhere to go? I can go to my sister in Toulon. Good. You? I'll be all right. - We're here. - Yes, thank you. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Good to see you. - Our guest, Mr. Charpentier. - Pleased to meet you. - He's the biggest publisher in Paris. - You flatter me. - Thank you for this meeting. - It's an honor. Let's go. Gentlemen, this is Colonel Picquart. Colonel. - Meet Senator Arthur Ranc. - Pleased to meet you. - Joseph Reinach. - Pleased to meet you. Member of the Chamber of Deputies. They coordinate the political campaign. Georges Clémenceau, columnist for "L'Aurore". Colonel. Mathieu Dreyfus. For three years he's been fighting to get justice for his brother. My family and I are enormously grateful to you. You don't have to thank me, I just listened to my conscience. Finally, I have the honor to present to you Emile Zola. I'm a great admirer of yours, Colonel. And I of your works. The Joint Chiefs have put themselves in the position of protecting the culprit Marie Charles Ferdinand Esterhazy, to keep Dreyfus in prison. That's why I was the brains of a conspiracy against Esterhazy. - Therefore I must be punished. - What will happen to you? I'll be arrested, Mr. Clémenceau. Arrested and probably kicked out of the army. The army is so narrow-minded! It's the only way to keep Dreyfus on the island. It's staggering! - There's shame in being French. - How can we help you? This story has to be told, people have to understand. As an officer on duty I cannot say anything about it. You can't. But I can. Maybe I'll end up on Devil's Island. - Dreyfus will be glad to have company. - How can you joke? I can't stand the idea of you alone in a cell. It doesn't matter. It's a fortress, not a prison. I'll dedicate myself to reading. I'm sorry I got you involved. I got myself into this. Colonel Picquart. I have a warrant for your arrest of the Minister of War. Can I have your weapon? Buy "L'Aurore"! Emile Zola's letter! Dreyfus defended by Zola! Emile Zola's letter to the president! Buy "L'Aurore"! Boy! Boy, come here. Can we stop? What does it say? "We witness this infamous spectacle. It proclaims the innocence of individuals burdened by debt and crime and it is damaging an incorruptible man. When a society goes this far, it decomposes. You don't publish such things! I accuse Lieutenant Colonel Du Paty de Clam of having been the architect of this miscarriage of justice." "I accuse General Mercier that he was complicit of one of the worst iniquities of the century." "I accuse General Billot of having had evidence of Dreyfus' innocence and covering it up. He is guilty of crimes against humanity and justice for political purposes and to save the compromised General Staff." "I accuse General de Pellieux and Major Ravary of having conducted an investigation dominated by monstrous bias. In the report of the latter we find a monument of naive audacity." "I accuse the expert calligraphers of having made fraudulent reports unless they were affected by visual and judgemental illness." "I accuse generals Boisdeffre and Gonse of the same crime. One through clerical fanaticism, the other through pride, making the Ministry of War an holy and untouchable ark." "I accuse the first War Council of convicting an accused on the basis of a secret document." "I accuse the second War Council of having covered up the crime of knowingly acquitting a delinquent." "In making these accusations I knowingly expose myself to articles 30 and 31 of the Press Law which punish crimes of defamation and I do this of my own free will." - Traitor! - To death! Traitor! - Traitor! - Death to Emile Zola! - To death! - You must die! - My dear Georges. - Louis! - Are you alright? - Yes. - Good. - Give it to me. Good heavens! - What a lovely place! - Isn't it? - Have a seat. - Thank you. Zola has been reported. - By the army? - No, the government. - When will he be judged? - Soon, in two weeks. Two weeks. Zola and Clémenceau would like you as a witness. - Yes, of course. - Good. They have the most aggressive lawyer in Paris, Fernand Labori. Labori. - Do you know him? - No. - They call him "The Viking", right? - No. You bastard! - Picquart, you bastard! - Traitor! Bastard! Swear to speak without hate or fear and tell the whole truth? I swear. - Your name? - Marie Georges Picquart. Place of residence? Fortress of Mont-Valérien, prison wing. Attorney Labori. Can you tell the Court who knows about the Esterhazy affair? In the spring of 1896 I found fragments of a telegram. From the military attaché of a country foreign to Major Esterhazy. It revealed that Esterhazy he was feeding him information. Consequently I had Esterhazy monitored. Four months later he wrote about an assignment at the Joint Chiefs. Twice! The handwriting matched the note known as "bordereau", attributed to Major Dreyfus. This was confirmed by the first expert appointed by the government. Did you inform your superiors of this news? - Of course. - What did they say? They said to keep the two cases separate. Major Lauth, can you come closer? You have stated that you believe that Colonel Picquart added the telegram to secret documents not yet examined. - That's what I believe. - Colonel Picquart. That doesn't make it true. Colonel Henry, come forward please. Thank you, Major Lauth. You have said that you saw Colonel Picquart showing the file to lawyer Leblois. Yes. He was in his office. He showed him the document in which he calls Dreyfus "that scumbag D." - You're wrong. I didn't show it to anyone. - I saw it. - That's all I can say. - May I ask a question? - How far did you get in? - My head was in the door opening. - How could you tell it was him? - I got a good look. The handwriting is not clear from up close, let alone from a distance. I know that document better than anyone and I saw it. You need a full airing? So be it! I'll tell it like it was. - Colonel Picquart is lying! - Mr. President! You heard Colonel Henry calling me a liar and Major Lauth insinuating that I fabricated the telegram. Do you know why? All the makers of the Dreyfus case... - Colonel! - Henry, Gribelin, Lauth, by order of General Gonse covering up Colonel Sandherr's mistakes, a sick man. - Sit down! - Do you know what my crime is? Thinking that honor doesn't defend itself with blind obedience. Enough! Maybe I'll get kicked out of the army that I love and gave 25 years to. Well, so be it. I still believe it was my duty to seek truth and justice. The army should be served in this way. - Enough! - Honestly. - Bravo! - You will pay for this insult. Silence! General Pellieux, come to the stand. - We're listening. - Nothing has been said about the Dreyfus affair. It's res judicata which is judged, but seeing how it was... As Colonel Henry says, "You need a full airing? So be it." In November 1896, the Ministry of War received proof of Dreyfus' guilt. I've seen it. It's a letter from one foreign military attaché to another. This what it says. "Questions arise about the Dreyfus affair. Never admit to the relationship we had with that Jew." - I ask to speak. - Pardon me! I am speaking. - I demand that the document be produced. - Attorney Labori! General Gonse, come closer please. The army fears nothing. But documents of that nature remain confidential. Summon General Boisdeffre. - He'll confirm. - Then summon him. - Bravo! - Long live the Republic! Long live the army! Long live the Republic! - Long live the general! - Bravo! Long live France! Long live the Republic! Bravo! Silence. Silence! We're listening. I heard about General Pellieux's statement. I confirm all items. It's precise, it reflects the truth. That's all I have to say. But, gentlemen... Allow me to add something. You are the jury. You are the nation. If the nation no longer has confidence in the leaders of its army to have responsibility for the national defence then leave this task to others. - Bravo! - It's a coup d'etat. Will they resign if they don't get the verdict they demand? - You don't have the floor. Thank you, General. - I have some questions for him. You don't have the floor. Colonel Picquart wants to say something. Colonel, come closer please. If Generals Pellieux and Boisdeffre had not revealed its existence I wouldn't have mentioned it. I am bound by the oath of secrecy. The letter they're talking about, this irrefutable evidence, is fake. - Cowardly liar! - Clown! - That's a lie! - Silence! Silence! The question is this. Did Emile Zola publish lies designed to compromise the honour and reputation of the army? Members of the jury, what is your verdict? On my honor and conscience the verdict of the jury is... Yes, the defendant is guilty. Bravo! By virtue of this, the Court condemns you to one year imprisonment - and a fine of 3,000 francs. - Yes! Bravo. - Long live France. - Bravo! - Long live France! - That's right! - That's right! Gentlemen, if one of you is injured, the duel will be interrupted. After inspection of the wound, if the wounded man wants, the duel will resume. En garde! Go! Mr. referee, this is ridiculous! Stop! Doctor! Examine the wound. It's nothing, he just missed you. - That man is crazy. - No, he's desperate. I'm fine! It's nothing! I'm ready. En garde! Go! Stop! No! I can go on. Give me a minute! Examination. - Who are you? - Labori. So, how is life at Santé? Mont-Valérien was better. I have a present for you. "Today Colonel Henry admitted to be the author of the letter of October 1896 in which Dreyfus was named. The Minister of War has ordered Henry's arrest. He's in Mont-Valérien now." - Why did he confess? - He had no choice. His letter was poorly made. He glued pieces together that didn't match. Poor fool! They'll have to redo the trial and repatriate Dreyfus. I'll call Henry to the stand. We'll bring down the government. Look, it's Picquart! - Colonel! - One question! - Gentlemen, one moment. - Quiet! I'm satisfied. After a year in prison the government has dropped the charges against me. It also decided to review Captain Dreyfus' conviction. - I demand that Esterhazy be arrested. - Esterhazy has challenged you to a duel. What will you do? He's a criminal, justice will take care of him. There he is. I'll kill you, you filthy coward! - I will have satisfaction! - Look for her among your whores. Coward! Traitor! Dirty Jew! - Name. - Alfred Dreyfus. Speak up. Alfred Dreyfus. - Age? - Thirty-nine. - Place of birth? - Mulhouse. - Rank? - Captain, diplomat at the Joint Chiefs. You are accused of high treason. - How do you plead? - I am... I'm... I'm innocent. Once again, on the honor of my name and my children. Colonel, I swear. I am innocent. About face! Present arms! General Mercier has the floor. I ordered the delivery of a file of evidence to the judges. There was a secret document and it should have stayed that way. Let me add something. I am an honest son of an honest man. If I had doubts, I would admit it. I would tell Captain Dreyfus that I made a mistake. Then tell him! But it's not like that. Since 1894 nothing has made my conviction waver. It has been strengthened by the painful efforts to prove his innocence. Not to mention the millions spent on him by the Jewish people. Mr. President, may I question the witness? Given the time, we'll continue listening to the testimony tomorrow. - But why? - The hearing is adjourned. You may go, General. Georges! - Are you ready? - Yes, I'm coming! Picquart! Gast! Good day, Labori. - Are you ready for battle? - Ready as I'll ever be. We're gonna blow up General Mercier with the arsenal you provided. My God! - Hurry! Help! - Stay with him! - He's been shot! - Help me! Help! Stop him! Murderer! Stop him! "In the name of the French people, today, September 9, 1899, the War Coucil of the 10th Legion of the Army Corps... declares the defendant Dreyfus Alfred, Captain of the 14th Artillery Regiment, by five votes to two, guilty of high treason." Long live France! Boo! "With the same majority and given the extenuating circumstances the Court therefore commutes the sentence to ten years in prison." Extenuating circumstances! Watch over my wife. Of course. Sorry to keep you waiting. Mathieu Dreyfus arrived as I was leaving the house. What did he want? They offered his brother a pardon. - He wanted my advice. - Wonderful! - What did you tell him? - He doesn't have to accept. - But then he'll be free. - Free, but technically guilty. - He hasn't seen his children in 5 years! - He has to hang in there. We will win. It'll be quicker if he stays in jail. - Waiter! A cognac. - Right away. Now that your divorce is official, - maybe we could get married. - We could. Do you think we should? - Do you want me to ask for your hand? - Not particularly. Why? Darling, it doesn't make much sense if you ask me that way. Don't you think? Forgive me. Will you marry me? No. Seriously? You refuse? You're not the marrying kind. And deep down, neither am I. Let's continue as before. Mr. Minister, Major Dreyfus is here. Let him in. General. Major. Please. Have a seat. - Have you been here before? - No, Minister. All right, then. - What did you want to discuss? - My rank. My promotion to major does not take into account the years of imprisonment. Your eight years outside the army are considered like you've been through them on duty. It's unfair. I consider it a prejudice. I see. What should I do about it? Promote me to my due rank. - Which is? - Lieutenant Colonel. - That requires a special law. - It should be done, it would be right. - That's not possible. - Why not? The law wouldn't pass. The political climate has changed. It is already difficult to work with those who were our enemies. - Why reopen the matter? - Because it's the right thing. I'm sorry, that's not possible. - If that's all... - Yes, that's all. I'm sorry that we couldn't talk in private these last few years. No, indeed. Not since the morning of my arrest. Yes. I apologize for the role that I had in this sad charade. You recovered very well. It's good to have done all this and finally be elected to government. And yet it's strange to say, but... - I wouldn't be here without you. - No, General. You're here because you did your duty. The two men never met again.
