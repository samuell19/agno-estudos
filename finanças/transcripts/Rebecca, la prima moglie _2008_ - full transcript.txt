Come on, Doc, this way. ﻿-Thank you. ﻿They're waiting for you. ﻿They're waiting for you. ﻿Doctor, finally. ﻿The pupil looks normal. The pulse is, too. ﻿How long has she been unconscious? ﻿-I don't know, she was unconcious when I arrived. ﻿We'll take her to the hospital straight away. ﻿-No. ﻿I want to wait for Maxim. I'm fine now ﻿You were unconcious for so long, ﻿we need to do an examination. ﻿I just fell down the stairs. That's all. ﻿If the doctor says you need to be examined ... ﻿-It's fine. ﻿As you wish, Mrs de Winter. But if you get dizzy, ﻿come to the hospital. ﻿-Ok, thank you. ﻿Thank you, Doctor, thank you. ﻿Tell me the truth. Are you pregnant? ﻿-I don't think so. ﻿Then why did you fall down the stairs? ﻿I slipped. ﻿-Andrew, what happened? ﻿-Glad you are here, sir. ﻿What happened? ﻿-I fell down the stairs. It's not that bad. ﻿Are you okay? ﻿-Yes I am, Maxim. ﻿-Are you sure? ﻿Yes. I'm fine now. ﻿-Let's go, we did everything we could. ﻿But go see the doctor again. You ﻿were unconscious for a long time. ﻿And where were you. Max? We could not find you. ﻿Thank you goodbye ﻿ ﻿Thank you, goodbye. ﻿-Goodbye. ﻿I was in London to meet Louis ﻿Redford, an old friend from school. ﻿I was in London to meet Louis ﻿Redford, an old friend from school. ﻿He has a publishing house. I asked ﻿if they would print your stories. ﻿Did you go to London for me? ﻿-I've been meaning to for a while. ﻿Are not you interested in what I told you? ﻿Of course. ﻿-He needs the stories in two weeks. ﻿If he likes it then this is it. ﻿I was anxious all day. ﻿I thought you went to London to get away from me. ﻿We need to trust each other. ﻿And always be honest. ﻿I brought you today's menu ... Ma'am ... ﻿Mrs de Winter's notebooks? ﻿-It's me... ﻿I'm Mrs de Winter. ﻿Today we will not eat meat. Change the menu. ﻿We will have fish with potatoes on the side. ﻿On Thursdays we usually make roast beef. ﻿-We will have that on Saturday. ﻿And tell the chefs I like my meat rare. ﻿Not well done. ﻿As you wish, Ma'am. De Winter My name is De Winter ﻿You haven't called me by my full name once since my arrival. ﻿It's time for you to start doing so. ﻿Prove that you are loyal, and I ﻿will try to forget everything that has happened. ﻿For Manderley. ﻿And for the sake of my husband.. ﻿Have I ever asked you for a big favor since we met? ﻿No. ﻿Can we host a ball? One of those fun costume balls ﻿that are hosted every year in Manderley. ﻿A ball? ﻿-You said ﻿that people in the county don't have anything ﻿to talk about but Manderley and its people. ﻿Let's give them something to talk about. ﻿Give them the kind of entertainment they want. ﻿And I will meet all the important people of the county at once. ﻿Is that really so important to you? ﻿Yes, Maxim. ﻿Very well. ﻿It'll be so much fun! ﻿Thank you. ﻿Welcome, ma'am. ﻿-Thank you, Robert. ﻿Good afternoon. ﻿-There you are. I was wondering when you would come. ﻿I was at the copy shop to print invitations for the ball. ﻿Honestly, tell me, we should celebrate your publication, right? ﻿Maxim told you! ﻿The title of the book will be La Principessa delle peonie. ﻿-Of course I told her, cara. ﻿I am very proud of you. Beatrice. ﻿-Hello Max. ﻿Let's look at them to make sure they're okay. ﻿Mr and Mrs de Winter invite you to a costume ball at Manderley. ﻿Perfect. ﻿-Yes, now you just have to print envelopes, ﻿stick on stamps, send them out, order wine and drinks, ﻿instruct the chefs, hire the musicians ﻿and make room in the salon for those who would like to dance. ﻿Have you already thought about ﻿what kind of costume you will wear? ﻿The only privilege I have as host is to not have to dress up. ﻿Have you thought about your costume? ﻿-It's a secret. I want to surprise you. ﻿Andrew, can I get a cup of tea? ﻿Excuse me... Mrs de Winter. ﻿Every evening I check the paper trash cans ﻿to make sure that we do not throw ﻿anything importan away on accident. ﻿Maybe you will still need these sketches? ﻿Thank you. Mrs Danvers. You can throw them away. ﻿I was sketching ideas for my costume. ﻿If you're looking for ideas, ﻿maybe one of the pictures in the gallery will inspire you. ﻿They show the de Winter's ancestors. ﻿You may find something nice. ﻿These are all men. I need a costume. ﻿Did you not notice the picture near the last window? ﻿Alright. ﻿-Let's go. ﻿Here she is. See? ﻿That's Carolina de Winter. ﻿Mr de Winter has always admired this picture. ﻿Thank you for your suggestion, Mrs Danvers. ﻿I'd like to keep it a secret. ﻿-Do not worry, Mrs de Winter. ﻿No one will know. ﻿The skirt needs to be big. ﻿And up here I would like flowers. In bright blue. ﻿Trust me, Mrs de Winter. You will look charming. ﻿The sketch is very precise. Keep it. ﻿If I were you I would look at her finished costumes. They are so beautiful ﻿And you wouldn't have to thank Mrs Danvers. ﻿I'm glad that Mrs Danvers has stopped fighting with me. ﻿Without her, I wouldn't have been ﻿able to organize such a huge party. We had to order 2000 roses. ﻿-She just did her job. ﻿But she helped me with choosing my costume. ﻿The idea to dress as Carolina de Winter is great. ﻿Alice, that's a secret. ﻿Do not even tell Robert. ﻿Don't worry, ma'am, not a word. ﻿I will take it. ﻿-But it is heavy. ﻿The mistress does not want anyone to see her costume. ﻿Did you peek? ﻿-I just want to help. ﻿-No, thank you. ﻿Welcome. ﻿-Count. Countess. ﻿Marquess. ﻿-The turban looks good on you. ﻿Not funny. The turban is too tight, and the shoes too wide. ﻿What costume has your wife chosen? ﻿-I have no idea. ﻿She insisted it would be a surprise. ﻿Are we going to have a drink? ﻿Mr de Winter will be swept off his feet. ﻿You look beautiful. ﻿'m alright, you can go celebrate. ﻿Are you sure? ﻿-Yes, but I can't take the corset off myself, I will need you later. ﻿Whoever it is, don't come in. ﻿-I'm sorry, ma'am. ﻿Mr de Winter is asking for you. The guests are in the salon. ﻿Tell him I'm coming right away. ﻿-All right, ma'am. ﻿Help me with the hat. ﻿-of course. ﻿Great fun. As always. ﻿-Good evening, Colonel Julyan. ﻿Madam. we can't wait to see your wife's costume. ﻿-I'm as curious as everyone. ﻿She will be here soon. I wish you a pleasant evening. ﻿-Thank you. ﻿Good evening, Mr de Winter. ﻿-Rebecca. ﻿What is it? ﻿What is it? ﻿Tell me what I did! ﻿Dear child, what a terrible coincidence. ﻿But how could you know? ﻿What? ﻿-Your costume. ﻿It's the same Rebecca wore to the last ball. ﻿Impossible. ﻿You copied the image of Carolina de Winter. ﻿Just like her. ﻿-I should have known. ﻿Where is Maxim? ﻿-I don't know. ﻿I took care of the guests. Someone from the family had to. ﻿I have to explain. ﻿-You should wait until tomorrow. ﻿When you have both calmed down. ﻿If you want my advice, ask Max to go on a trip. ﻿To get away from the gossip. ﻿Get some rest. ﻿Have you seen my husband? ﻿-He was in the library just now. ﻿Do you need me anymore? ﻿-No, thank you Robert, you can go. Good night. ﻿Maxim, I know you're inside. ﻿Please let me in. ﻿Maxim? ﻿I need to talk to you, explain everything. ﻿Please open the door. ﻿Maxim? ﻿I saw you in your dress. You don't live up to her. ﻿You're not Rebecca. You're not like her. ﻿Rebecca's dead. ﻿She's dead! Dead ﻿Not to him. Not to Max de Winter. ﻿He always thinks of her. Her and no one else. ﻿Why don't you leave? ﻿It would be easy. ﻿Just lean over a little further. ﻿And everything will be over. ﻿There will be no sadness, no fear. ﻿No pain. ﻿Death will embrace you. ﻿What happened? ﻿What happened? ﻿-Call whoever you can. Don't waste time. ﻿What happened? ﻿-A ship is on the rocks. They fired signals. ﻿The sea is rough, the fog is thick. ﻿-We need hot food. ﻿Tell the staff that I'm coming. ﻿Is there news? ﻿I know nothing as of now. Everyone's still down at the bay. ﻿-And my husband? ﻿Yes, I think he's there, too. When ﻿needed, Mr de Winter is the first to help. ﻿The anchor of the ship.got caught on something. ﻿They sent the diver down to free it. ﻿And eventually the found Morning breeze. ﻿Take this down to the bay. And take blankets from the corridor. ﻿Morning breeze?! Are you sure? ﻿Morning breeze is the name of Rebecca's yacht, isn't it? ﻿That’s right, ma'am. ﻿I'm going down to the bay. ﻿-Allow me, ma'am, ﻿but Mr de Winter is there. ﻿And I think right now you should stay here. ﻿Have you seen Mr de Winter? ﻿-No, ma'am. ﻿-Thank you. ﻿Go back! ﻿-Here! ﻿Two over there! ﻿-Slowly! ﻿Let's go! ﻿-The water is flooding the boat. ﻿Robert! Robert! ﻿Excuse me, excuse me. ﻿Have you seen Max? ﻿-He left before they pulled out the yacht. ﻿It's Rebecca, isn't it? ﻿-It is. ﻿You go back, Robert. I'll look for him. ﻿Mrs Rebecca returned with her yacht. ﻿Now everyone will know the truth. ﻿And he just sits in the cottage. ﻿I was wondering when you'd come. ﻿Whatever happens, I love you. ﻿I never meant to hurt or embarrass you. ﻿About the costume.. ﻿-To hell with the bloody costume! ﻿Do you really love me that much? ﻿You can't imagine how much.. ﻿This place is cursed. And this damn bay is cursed! ﻿Excuse me, Mr de Winter. ﻿In Morning breeze they found a body... ﻿What does that mean? ﻿What body? ﻿Maxim? ﻿What body? ﻿I came as soon as I heard. We managed to lift the body. ﻿Do they know who it is? ﻿It's been in the sea for more than a year. ﻿Judging by the clothes, it is the body of your wife. ﻿Pardon me, your first wife. ﻿I'm afraid you need to come to the ﻿morgue with me to identify her. ﻿Give me five minutes and I Will. ﻿Alright. I'll wait outside. ﻿Maxim, Ι'll go with you. ﻿No need. I'd rather go alone. ﻿But you are not alone. ﻿I've arranged for everything to go as quickly as possible. ﻿Be brave. ﻿Lift. ﻿Nothing. It's just bones. ﻿How... ﻿This was on the fingers. We cleaned it. ﻿It's your name. ﻿And the date of your wedding. ﻿This is undoubtedly Rebecca's body. ﻿Which means the body they found a year ago. ﻿which you identified, she was not your wife. ﻿Apparently so. ﻿Lord, let your daughter Rebecca rest in peace. ﻿Merciful Father, you gave us life and love ... ﻿Why is Danvers not here? ﻿When they found the body, she was in terrible shock. ﻿She chose the flowers for the funeral ﻿and then locked herself in her room. ﻿How strange to bury the first wife in the company of another? ﻿Obnoxious type of guy, that Favell. ﻿How do you know him? ﻿He was at Manderley. ﻿The day you were in London. ﻿Why did not you tell me? ﻿I didn't want to upset you. ﻿It's all over now. ﻿Excuse me, Max. ﻿Finding the yacht requires us to open the investigation again. ﻿It's just a bunch of formalities ﻿which, unfortunately, are inevitable. ﻿I should have known. ﻿How come we didn't get the newspapers today? ﻿They didn't deliver it. ﻿You arranged it, didn't you? ﻿They don't write about anything ﻿but the investigation. ﻿It drives me crazy. ﻿Maxim ... ﻿I know you're hurt now, but.. ﻿-No, you don't understand. ﻿Nobody knows what finding her body means. ﻿Nobody. ﻿Mr de Winter, two months after the death of your wife ﻿you identified a body which was not hers. ﻿How could you have been so wrong? ﻿-It was in the sea for a long time. ﻿But the first body had nothing in common with your wife. ﻿I was upset, your honour. ﻿You didn't even notice that she wasn't wearing a wedding ring? ﻿Sometimes it's difficult to keep a clear head. ﻿You bought Morning breeze? ﻿Mrs de Winter personally commissioned this yacht. ﻿She wanted a little boat which she could manage herself. ﻿What do you think is the cause of the shipwreck? ﻿According to the weather report ﻿the sea was completely calm that night. ﻿The boat was easy to navigate. ﻿Maybe it was deliberately flooded. ﻿See these holes? ﻿Nobody can tell us they are caused by rocks. ﻿Maybe someone who was on the ﻿yacht broke the boards with an ax. ﻿Can you think of a reason why your ﻿wife would have taken her life? ﻿What was your relationship like? ﻿Everyone knows that our marriage was perfect. ﻿The entire county talks about you. ﻿I knew you'd return eventually. ﻿And never leave again. ﻿Colonel. ﻿-Hello. Max. ﻿The judge came, too. ﻿-Good afternoon. ﻿Good afternoon. ﻿-Come on, gentlemen. ﻿Where do we start? ﻿The judge wants to search the deceased's belongings. ﻿Maybe we will find something that ﻿suggests a motive for her suicide. ﻿Sorry, but we will have to turn everything upside down. ﻿I apologize in advance. ﻿Understood. ﻿It's best to stay out of the way. ﻿Andrew, I'm going to the property office. ﻿Tell Madam that I will not be back for lunch. ﻿-Yes, sir. ﻿-Gentlemen. ﻿This way. please. ﻿Good afternoon. ﻿-Good afternoon. ﻿-I will lead the way. gentleman. ﻿How are you doing, Mrs. Danvers? ﻿This way. ﻿This hasn't changed since the last time. No, I take care of it ﻿Personally. ﻿I started working for Rebecca when she was only 13 years old. I took care of her all her life ﻿If you knew her so well, ﻿do you think she had any reason to commit suicide? ﻿She was scared of aging. ﻿But she was so young. And beautiful. ﻿Everyone was enchanted by her charm ﻿Now that we're here, let's take a look. ﻿They looked at the rooms upstairs, now they are in the library. ﻿This is the only room they haven't been in yet. ﻿Excuse me, but we have to take a look at this room. ﻿There is nothing left of Rebecca in here. ﻿Because you burned all the notebooks of Mrs de Winter. ﻿I wanted to keep these memories. ﻿But I wasn't allowed. ﻿What a useless and embarassing investigation. If we don't find anything we will close the case ﻿Mr de Winter will not be back for lunch. ﻿Do you want me to serve it in the dining room ﻿or bring it here? ﻿I will eat later. ﻿That's not all, Mrs Danvers. ﻿I don't want to burden my husband with more concerns right now ﻿but as soon as they close the ﻿investigation, you will leave Manderley. ﻿Mr de Winter will not agree with that. ﻿Mr de Winter has entrusted me with managing the house. ﻿So this is my decision. ﻿I'm so glad you're here. ﻿-I wouldn't miss it, dear Danny. ﻿We know how much we loved Rebecca. ﻿Silence. Here comes the judge. ﻿After hearing the testimony of the witnesses ﻿and investigating the wreck of Morning Breeze, ﻿we conclude that Rebecca de Winter died at sea ﻿under undeclared circumstances. ﻿The investigation is closed due to a lack of evidence. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Two hours to sign a few documents. I'm tired. ﻿I'll tell your sister that the investigation is closed. ﻿And I'll tell the call center to connect all ﻿phone calls to the property management. ﻿Whether it's curious journalists or friends. ﻿We need peace. ﻿Peace? ﻿What peace? ﻿Good afternoon, Mr de Winter. ﻿Excuse me, Jack Favell is waiting for you in the library. ﻿Favell is here? ﻿Yes, Max. ﻿We need to talk. ﻿About what? ﻿-Rebecca's death. ﻿I was her first cousin. ﻿You know I loved her. ﻿Let me. Let me go. ﻿We always had good drinks at Manderley. ﻿-Say what you have to say, then go. ﻿That's not how de Winter treats guests. ﻿Not your style, Max. ﻿And I came to help you. ﻿This morning I was at the conclusion of the investigation. ﻿-And? ﻿The judge says they have no evidence. ﻿Accident or suicide? Who knows? ﻿Poor people working in the dark. ﻿But if someone did have new evidence. ﻿they would open the investigation again ﻿and the truth would finally come out. ﻿Is that what you think? ﻿I would say that I was convinced by one piece of evidence. ﻿I have a note in which Rebecca calls me to the cottage. ﻿The night she died. ﻿Are you saying you were at the bay? ﻿No. ﻿Unfortunately, I only got the note the next morning. ﻿But if I gave it to the judge, ﻿they would certainly open the investigation again. ﻿I have reason to think Rebecca invited me ﻿to tell me she was pregnant. ﻿With my child. ﻿You will object that I have no evidence. ﻿But the fact is that this note answers one key question. ﻿Simple but very important. ﻿Why would Rebecca go sailing if she was waiting for me? ﻿And if she was going to commit suicide, ﻿why would she arrange a meeting at the cottage? ﻿-What do you want, Favell? ﻿Nature is beautiful here, isn't it? ﻿I wonder how much a small estate would cost ﻿where a man could live comfortably. ﻿As a gentleman. ﻿As of now, I sell luxury cars. ﻿I get it. You want to blackmail me with that note. ﻿Blackmail? ﻿I would call it a business agreement. ﻿Out. ﻿If you don't call me within a week, ﻿I will give the note to Colonel Julyan. ﻿And then we'll have fun. ﻿Mr de Winter is having dinner in his room. Is it ready? ﻿The Master isn't coming down for dinner? That's a first. ﻿It wasn't even that bad after the accident. ﻿But since they found the yacht, he has been sleeping alone. ﻿No gossip in the house in which I am the majordome! ﻿Maxim? ﻿Maxim! ﻿You can't do this to me. ﻿I don't ask you to love me how I love you. ﻿I just want you to take care of me. ﻿Maxim, open, please. ﻿Amore. Amore. ﻿Together we will survive this. We can't be together. ﻿Why do you say that? We will always be together. ﻿It would be best ﻿for you to leave Manderley. ﻿I don't want to replace her. ﻿It’s true, I was hoping for that. But I realized that I can't. ﻿But I love you and I want to be yours. ﻿-I want you to leave. ﻿That's crazy! You'd rather die with Rebecca than live with me. ﻿Never say that name again! ﻿Never. ﻿As you wish. ﻿Louis Redford, publisher. ﻿La Principessa delle peonie. ﻿Yes, Andrew. ﻿Mr de Winter asked me to give this to you. ﻿Tell Mr de Winter that I don't need his money. ﻿I will leave with what I came. ﻿I'm sorry, but you're so young ... ﻿-Don't worry. ﻿Thank you, Andrew, I'll manage. ﻿My publisher writes that a lot of ﻿copies have already been ordered. ﻿A de Winter has never... ﻿I was never Mr de Winter's wife. ﻿Only a companion. ﻿Lord Manderley is a widower. Inconsolable. ﻿Tell Alice to pick up my things from the desk. ﻿To put them in the bag and take it to the car. ﻿I'm waiting downstairs. ﻿I'm chocking here. ﻿Give it to me, ma'am. ﻿-Thank you. ﻿Jasper! Hello! Now... ﻿Goodbye. ﻿-I did as you ordered. I got everything from the desk. ﻿Andrew sends you a jar of blackberry jam. ﻿Give it to me. ﻿-Thank you. ﻿Tell me how you and Robert are doing. ﻿Here you are. ﻿Read this to your brothers. ﻿-Thank you, Mrs de Winter. ﻿It's beautiful. ﻿These are my stories. ﻿But this is not a fairytale castle. ﻿I already have nightmares. ﻿I asked Andrew to keep you employed. ﻿You can take my clothes from the closet. ﻿-Thank you. ﻿Write to my publisher's address. It’s on the last page of the book. ﻿Thank you, Alice. ﻿Here you go, ma'am. ﻿Let me take this. ﻿-No, thank you. I'd rather carry it myself. ﻿As you wish. Well...have a safe trip. ﻿-Thank you, Robert. ﻿Good morning. ﻿When is the first train to London leaving? ﻿In 25 minutes. ﻿-One ticket, please. ﻿Which class? ﻿Second. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Good morning, one ticket to London. ﻿Which class? ﻿-Second. ﻿Who knows if it was an accident or suicide? ﻿Why would he kill her when he loved her so much? ﻿-Maybe you're right. ﻿But I find the sinking of the ship very strange. ﻿And to kill such an elegant and fine lady?! Whatever for? ﻿Train to London arrives on the first platform. ﻿Repeat. Train to London arrives on the first platform. ﻿I'll get you coffee right away. ﻿Has she left? ﻿Just now. ﻿It's better that way. ﻿She looked broken. ﻿Just like you. ﻿Excuse me for speaking freely. ﻿but I've known you your whole life and ... ﻿-It's for her own good. ﻿I think you made a terrible mistake and ... ﻿Pour me a cup of coffee, Andrew. ﻿Who knew you'd come back here?! ﻿Where else would I find such a good pansion, Madam? ﻿With such a lovely owner. ﻿-You got lucky. ﻿Room 44 is free. ﻿Yes, I got very lucky. ﻿Come in. ﻿I brought you some clean towels. ﻿-Thank you. ﻿How marvelous! Is this yours? ﻿It isn't. It was in the drawer of a desk I used for a while. ﻿I don't know what it is. ﻿-R is the initial of some name? Rosalinde, for example? ﻿Or Roxana? ﻿Rebecca. ﻿-A nice name. ﻿Do you know the last name? ﻿-No. ﻿It must have been a lady of high society. ﻿At a ball one day, at a beauty clinic the next. ﻿Doctor Phillips. ﻿Gynecologist. ﻿Excuse me. Where's Dr. Phillips' office? ﻿-The house over there. ﻿Thank you. ﻿I'm glad you called me. ﻿Gentlemen always reach an agreement. ﻿Here's my suggestion. ﻿I'm not willing to pay your silence. ﻿Report me. Do what you want. ﻿But never come back here. ﻿You don’t think I have the courage to ruin the name de Winter? ﻿That I made everything up? ﻿We'll see. ﻿See, Rebecca? ﻿He decided to kill himself. ﻿It's the only way he can be with you. ﻿You can not forget me. You can not forget your wife Rebecca. ﻿Rebecca, Rebecca. ﻿Maxim, what are you doing? Stop! ﻿-Let me go! ﻿What do you want to do? Stop! ﻿-Let me go! ﻿You stupid little fool, you can't stop him. ﻿He wants to be with Rebecca. ﻿Please! No! ﻿God, please, no. ﻿Standing near me could kill you. ﻿Before you do something crazy, you need to know something. ﻿Nothing can change my mind. I'm a killer. ﻿I have to pay! ﻿-A killer? ﻿Rebecca did not drown. ﻿She didn’t commit suicide either. ﻿I killed her. ﻿Why did you kill her when you loved her so much? ﻿Loved her?! Loved?! ﻿I hated her! With all my heart. ﻿You didn't love her? -No. ﻿-You didn't? -No! ﻿You have to tell me everything. Everything. ﻿One night I came down here to find her in the cottage. ﻿It's where she usually met with Jack Favell. ﻿One of her many lovers. ﻿I wanted to tell her that I was tired of her cheating on me. ﻿But she told me she had a surprise for me. ﻿My dear Max. soon your beloved Manderley will have an heir ﻿to play hide and seek in his chambers. ﻿I'm pregnant with Jack Favell's child. He doesn't know yet. ﻿I told you first. He will be a de Winter. ﻿You can't do this to me. ﻿I won't allow it. ﻿-How? ﻿You forget that everyone thinks we're the perfect couple. ﻿Lacking only the joy of a child. ﻿If you don't want an heir, you will have to kill me. ﻿Let's see if you have the courage to do ﻿I just want you to leave Manderley. That's all. ﻿That would be too easy, dear Max. ﻿Wouldn't that make me the maid who didn't do her job well? ﻿You can't do that. You will keep me safe ﻿and everything that comes with me. ﻿-Enough! ﻿It's terrible. I can't stand you anymore. ﻿You will have to. Just like you have so far. ﻿Because I'm stronger than you. Lord Manderley. ﻿If you were a real man, not a fool that will screw up, ﻿to save the name de Winter, ﻿you would kill me. ﻿Right here, right now. ﻿Now. ﻿I checked her pulse and realized she was dead. ﻿I cleaned the blood off the floor. ﻿and got rid of her body. ﻿It was already late at night. There was nobody there. I think. ﻿I decided to take her to Morning ﻿breeze. It was anchored in the bay. ﻿While I was steering the boat. I ﻿remembered the horrible years with her. ﻿Our honeymoon in Monte Carlo, ﻿on the cliffs where you saw me for the first time, ﻿I discovered she had deceived me. ﻿And while she was saying that, she laughed and laughed. ﻿That's when I started to hate her. ﻿But I did not immediately see how perverted she was. ﻿Cruel. ﻿I decided to sink the yacht. ﻿While Morning breeze sank, I returned to the boat. ﻿Ever since, everyone in Manderley ﻿seems to be a witness accusing me. ﻿Who could see through me? ﻿Favell, her lover? ﻿Or Mrs Danvers who adored her? ﻿How many times did I want to fire her! ﻿But I was afraid she would get suspicious. ﻿And I thought you trusted her. ﻿I only trusted you. ﻿But I knew that I don't deserve you. ﻿-No... ﻿I kept telling myself: ﻿She doesn't know, but she married a murderer. ﻿It's not that simple. ﻿-But it is! ﻿Soon he'll expose me. ﻿Favell has a note from Rebecca that ﻿will open the investigation again. ﻿He tried to blackmail me. But he wouldn't succeed. ﻿Because I will kill myself. ﻿-No, you won't. ﻿Maxim, listen to me. ﻿Rebecca wanted you to kill her. ﻿Your wife thought that she was pregnant, but she had cancer. ﻿There was still a little life left in her. ﻿So she decided to die at your hands. ﻿She provoked you until you pulled the trigger ﻿so that you would go down with her. ﻿Who told you this? ﻿-Rebecca's planner. ﻿On her last day she had a meeting with a doctor. ﻿A gynecologist from London. ﻿Dr. Phillips. ﻿I visited him in hopes of finding... anything. ﻿Cancer. Final stage. ﻿She knew she was dying. ﻿That was her last trick. ﻿If Colonel Julyan decides to open the investigation again. ﻿Dr. Phillips is ready to testify that Rebecca was deathly ill ﻿and that she wanted to die. When she left his office, she told him ﻿that she wouldn't let the cancer kill her. ﻿Two months of life? No, Doctor, much less than that. ﻿That's what she said. ﻿Do you understand? ﻿It's all over. ﻿Maxim ... ﻿Rebecca, you're the only mistress of Manderley. ﻿The castle can't be left to a man who has forgotten you ﻿and the one who dared to take your place. ﻿Everything has to end .. ﻿With you. ﻿Let's go home. ﻿Oh my God. ﻿Manderley’s in flames! ﻿Beware of the fire! Let's go faster! ﻿Beware! ﻿Who is missing? Is everyone here? ﻿Only Mrs Danvers is missing. ﻿-Where is she? ﻿Andrew! ﻿-Sir! ﻿Are you all safe? ﻿I personally ensured everyone made it out. ﻿I told the firefighters and all tenants to help us. ﻿Jasper! Jasper! ﻿There he is. Robert. ﻿-Madam. ﻿Thank you. Robert. ﻿Only Mrs Danvers is missing. She ﻿was last seen in the west wing. ﻿What happened? ﻿-I don't know, sir. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿You took Manderley.
