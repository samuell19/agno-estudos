Daddy!' Oh, god. Oh, baby. Mary! Mary! Stay there! Don't move! Diana, don't talk to me like that, okay? But I'm the only one who says no. - It's not fair! - Okay, Diana, we're going to a museum. My little girl. Easy, champ. Daddy! * Mary! Di? Di? Diana! I giggles 1 come on, you know better than that. Well, that's the problem. You can't completely know someone. I didn't mean to scare you. Yes, you did. Not that bad anyway. The dream, I take it? The dream. I'm worried about you. Join the club. Maybe it's time to see somebody. Somebody will preach what everybody preaches. Somebody will help you to believe the truth, di. It wasn't your fault. I'll think about it, okay? Psych 101... Play along to shut him up. I'm not playing along. But if you join me in there, I will. Late night last night? Hey, no, Katie! No, I need that. Come on, it's not funny. Katie, come on. Catch me. Hey, quit it, okay? I'm center stage in... Shit... 10 minutes. A t.A. Should be better prepared. At.A. Doesn't give Greg t & a all night... When she should be studying. Ha. - Are you psychic? - Your best friend... same thing. Yeah, well, I'm the one giving the lecture, not you. So is Greg weirded out 'cause he's in your class? It's not a big deal. Not a big deal? Di, you have your choice of grad schools next year. I guess so. You and Greg talked about next year yet? Have you and Billy? We don't need to. Billy does whatever I tell him to do. Hey, bimbos. - Where the hell were you last night? - Research, baby. It was just research. Translation: Getting wasted. Hey, that hurts. Actually, I pulled an all-nighter interviewing young horny chicks. - Ah, now that I believe. - Do you have a death wish? Purely academic. For my new psych paper. - On foot fetishes? - No, new subject! Ready? "Sex in public places: Ls it hotter?" - What do you think? No, you don't. - I think I want a new boyfriend. You know, you should be careful. Hey! Speak of the devil. We were just talking about you. Only good things, I hope. Greg was just telling us how hard you'd been working on the project. You know, Diana, you should be careful. Boys who don't get the attention they need tend to look elsewhere for it. Oh, I'm not too worried. When you're this good, they never wander. But through his experience of the trojan war, achilles became a wise man, for he learned human suffering and the larger scope of the heart. Your interpretation, Diana. Uh, yes, I was... Just getting to that, professor. My point is, achilles was a tragic figure for he gained a deeper understanding of the world through calamity. We all face our own personal trials in life, and I think it's important to appreciate that often through pain comes catharsis, and, in turn, spiritual growth. Thank you. Tomorrow, I want papers from all of you on the pride of agamemnon and the role it played in extending the trojan war. - You were great. - Are you lying? Diana. I'll see you in the museum. Uh, 5330. Just blow him off. It's my job. I don't ask you to blow off things you love. The only thing I love is you. Oh, nice try. Look, I'll be done by 8:00. Same line, different day. The museum is setting up a new exhibit from Iran, and barash has weaseled the first look. He's letting me help for the first time. I can't pass this up. I'm losing out to a geek boy professor. Relax, brown eyes. You're in the lead. 8:00 by the latest. I promise. Professor? Hm. Hm. What? Shit. Hello? Who's there? Hello? Fear is a common indication of guilt, you know? What are you guilty of, Diana? Only a breakthrough. Hey, that was addressed to me. I know, but you weren't here and... Look at the box. It's just a shell. The real prize was inside. Wow! That's magnificent. What is it? Well, we'll find out soon enough. What about the inscriptions? Translation papers are in the desk. Well, i... I speak fluent arabic. Really? Benefits of the classical education. So, simple casing. What do you see? Aramaic inscription. Okay, look again, but this time, scrunch up your eyes. Fascinating. The eye of god. I pressed it, and open sesame. Well, I mean I'm sure you would've figured that out in seconds. No, no. Don't... don't minimize your accomplishments, Diana. You, you're my best student, and-and this, this is... This is a remarkable discovery. Thank you. Well, you know what? I think... I think this is a case for celebration. Have you had dinner? Actually, no, but... - Excellent! I'll pop open a vintage chardonnay and we can decipher these inscriptions. And maybe you can tell me a little about yourself. Beyond academia, of course, like... We spend so much time together, and the truth is, I hardly know you, Diana. - I'm sorry, professor, i... - Oh, no. I have plans. I'm really sorry. Oh, I see. Um, you know, if I could change them, i... In any case, I don't think my boyfriend would understand. I don't appreciate your insinuation, Diana. Oh, no, I didn't mean it like... I mean, um... Good night, professor. Ah! - Oh, Jesus. - Not even close. Where is the one who woke me? ' 'Hmm? Fear, my good man, is an instinct. Trust yours. I am real. Not a figment of your guilty conscience. Where's my waker? If you are real, I... I can't answer that. A learned man. One who knows of me. I am honored. I can help you. I don't need help. Come now, professor, you reek of loneliness from your every pore. End your misery forever. Any woman, true perfect love for all eternity. Surely a man of your erudition can properly couch such a wish. Then you leave me no alternative. Please, professor. L... if we... don't! It's all right, sweetheart. It's all right. Please, don't! I... i... No! No! No, it wasn't like that. Will anyone believe you? Refuse me again, and the world will know, my good professor. Thus, your world will end. Where is my waker? I... I don't... I don't... I don't know exactly. I swear to you. - As you wish. - Please! Just... just give me a chance. Wish, please. And if I do? Then your indiscretions shall remain our secret. I wish... For the most Beau... No. I wish for the two women whom I find to be the most beautiful in the world to be in love with me and to be right here at this very moment. Done! Oh! Ah, true love. So, talk to me. - About what? - You and Greg. Is everything all right? We're fine. You still haven't told him those three magic words, have you? - Katie. - Repeat after me. L... Love... You. You're gonna lose him, girlfriend. Keep that wall up, and he's eventually gonna walk. - You haven't yet. - Yeah, well, that's because I'm a woman, I can see through walls. Men lack X-ray vision. Yeah. - That they do. - Speaking of the weaker sex. - Hi. - Hey. Come here, baby. Sorry. All right, let's go see the movie. What's wrong? Hey, are you okay? Um, barash, i... I just saw him. You just saw barash? You need a doctor, di. No, just-just give me a second, okay? - I gotta go. - What are you talking about? Go where? I forgot something back at the lab. - I'll come with you. - No! Just... I'll find you later. Okay? What the hell am I doing wrong? - Just give her some space. She'll come around. Hmm. Ahh. Ooh. Thank you, professor. Return to sender. Ah, "the lliad." Hmm? I knew the author. Hah. Professor? Mr. kid! Katie! Come out, come out, wherever you are. Where, oh, where could she be? Ah, I like this game. Here, Katie, Katie, Katie, Katie. My sneaky little wench. Boo! Sucker! Whatever. I knew you were there. Yeah, fight. Go change your boxers. - Wait! Where-where you going? - Back to the labyrinth. My ass is grass if she finds out I snatched it. - But you looked horny. You're so romantic. Wait! You like that, huh? Hey, you, uh... You feeling bold? Always. All right, trust me. - Hold on! - No, it's gotta be now! Asap. - Why? - 'Cause the coast is clear. Huh? Huh? You know what I'm talking about? Come here. Ladies, first. Mmm. Oh. Go to the left. - So beautiful. - Oh, yeah? Are you high? Somebody's gonna come in. "Sex in a public place: Ls it hotter?" - Mm. - First-person experiment. - My naughty little scientist. - Oh, behave. ♪ I wake up brand-new faces ♪ ♪ Not many words were said ♪ ♪ No words seemed wasted ♪ ♪ We sang instead ♪ ♪ What if they met back in the day ♪ ♪ When all that was said was naive to say ♪ ♪ What if they had called it a day ♪ R flyin' r ♪ drinkin' coffee ♪ ♪ The cup that changes ♪ ♪ All that was said ♪ ♪ The smile on your face ♪ ♪ The smile that changes ♪ ♪ Flyin' drinkin' ♪ Go away.

Yadda, yadda, yadda. "On the sixth day, "the box was discovered in a secret chamber, "concealed and protected on all sides. The box appears to be persian in origin and dates back to the 12th century." - I'll come back later. - No, no, wait. The inscription on the box warns that it holds the secret stone of fire. Uh-huh. And that legend dictates that an ancient race of demons, the djinn, are trapped inside the stone. Don't you get it? It's the heart of the myth. It's like an evil Aladdin's lamp or pandora's box. You know? I found the stone, Greg. I opened the box, I touched it with my own hands. You're actually buying that? Do you love me? - Actually, that's what I came to ask you. - Just answer my question. You know I do. Then you trust me? Absolutely. My, uh, episode in the common room, I saw something. I know it sounds nuts, but I saw barash clear as day in his office being murdered. Please, he had... he had the stone. I... I went back to his office, and it was a complete mess. He was gone, so was the stone. His tutorial was open with a fresh drop of blood right next to my name. Di, that could mean anything. And now he's not answering his phone, he's not answering his cell. His car's still in the parking lot. Nobody can find him. - Okay, calm down. - For Christ's sake! Any idiot can see that something's wrong. I'm sorry. I just... I really need you to hear me right now. I do hear you, di. But I need you to hear me too. You didn't answer my question. I understand that because of your past you may have fears of intimacy. Can we please talk about this later? What I don't understand is your refusal to get help. I never will, di. Jesus! Professor, what are you doing here? I didn't mean to startle you, Ms. kauflan. You're looking a little more presentable than usual. Big date tonight? - Indeed. - Who's the lucky girl? I mean, woman. I need to see a transcript of Diana Collins, please. My dear professor, you of all people know these files are confidential. Of course. However, miss Collins has made representations about her grade point average to the university in order to secure a research position, and I need to confirm the veracity of her application. Can't release a file without a student's official consent. I understand. Unfortunately, we need to confirm the position tonight. And we're unable to locate miss Collins. So, if you could make an exception this one time, we'd be very grateful. Your gratitude is the last thing I need right now, professor. Well, what is it exactly that you do need? What would you wish for above all else? You're gonna make all my dreams come true? Is that it? Just one wish at a time. Okay, fine. You want a wish? I wish this whole mountain of files would go up in flames, so I could get the hell out of here. I wish you hadn't said that. Are you with me, child? All I wanted was a simple file. Hey, Charlie, you wanna go down to campus security and grab that report? Yeah. All right. Hey. What are you doing? Hey, come back here! Good morning, ladies, gentlemen. Diana Collins? You should know, professor. She's always late. All right, then, let's get started. "The pride of agamemnon and its role in extending the trojan war." Ah, yes, trojan war... One of my favorites. But the question is flawed. The extension of the trojan war had less to do with agamemnon as with... the djinn. We haven't covered the djinn myth yet. That's next semester. Really? Well, how do you hope to understand the trojan war without studying the djinn myth? The greeks may have worshiped them as Zeus, bacchus, hera, Aphrodite, but they were djinn all the same. Take, uh, Helen of Troy, for example. History has judged her to be a tramp... Who left her respectable husband for a young lover. But if you'd met Paris, you would know that this could not possibly be true. Paris was a rather pathetic specimen whose tastes ran to goats and boys, rather than other men's wives. Or students. You wish to talk in my class? Stand up. Do you wish to talk in my class? No. As I was saying, a rather pathetic specimen. Sit down. The truth about Helen, a rather sweet, if plain, girl, was that she merely asked the djinn to make everybody fall in love with her. Simple wish, but very unspecific. The result was a 10-year war and the total destruction of the trojan civilization. Now, where is Diana? "And when god breathed fire into the universe, "and the light gave birth to angels, and the earth gave birth to man, "and the fire gave birth to the djinn, "creatures condemned to dwell in the void between the worlds. "One who wakes the djinn shall be given three wishes. Upon the granting of the third, "the unholy legions of the djinn shall be freed upon the earth. Fear one thing... Fear the djinn." If you see Diana, could you tell her I'm looking for her. Sure thing. What's up? Don't look up. Just turn left and meet me around the corner. Okay. - You're okay. - Ohhh. What's barash doing up there? I don't know. But he's sure got a hard-on to talk to you. Wait... he knows my name? Yeah. No shit, Sherlock. Well, what the hell's going on? - We gotta get outta here. Please! - Would you just calm down! No! Talk to us now. Look, some things are impossible to believe, and yet the curse of tutankhamen's tomb, for example, or the reality of Dracula and vlad the impaler... Please! You guys have to trust me on... Barash isn't barash. He's... Being possessed by some kind of a demon called a djinn. - Not this again. - Goddamn, di, this is the best one yet. This isn't one of our fucking games, Billy. Barash and Ms. kauflan are dead. Who is Ms. kauflan? She was killed in the fire last night. - At the admin building? - Yes! The djinn burned her to death. - You mean professor barash. - This isn't a joke, Katie. Yeah, Kat. I mean, you k now, our exams are gonna be murder now. Barash is dead. I saw him killed last night. The djinn has taken over his body. Well, give it up, Collins, all right? I suddenly need a pint. I think you should have one too. - Let's go. - You know what? I tried. Wait! Just wait there! Please help me. For Christ sakes, Jansen. I mean, come on, buddy, she's yanking your chain, and you're sucking it up like a hoover deluxe. - What's wrong with you? - She's been on this kick since last night. - It isn't... - A new joke. If we could just get her to health services, somebody could check her out. Please! Fine. What? Oh, man, I do not believe this. Believe it. You coming? Let me put it this way, all right: I don't fall for strippers or hookers or lame-ass jokes. So, no. Bye. - Thanks. - You're welcome. No, I tell you, I can explain... I don't wanna hear another word, okay? You're either with me or not. And if you're not, get lost and stop slowing me down. Hey, what now? If the djinn grants three of my wishes, he has the power to open the gates of hell. - That's bad, right? - Don't patronize me, Katie. I don't have time. Okay, look. Barash was talking about the djinn in class today. - He was? - Yeah. What does that mean? - It means I'm telling the truth. - Okay, fine. Let's say that you are. There must be something we can do... get a priest or something? Doesn't work that way, at least not in anything I've read. That's why we're here. Well, looks like I'm finally gonna hit the books. Folks, sign in here, please. Sign in here, please. Excuse me. Excuse me, if you're not part of the dorm, you have to sign in! Hello! Hello! How you doing? You're tight with the faculty, right? Some of them. What's this I hear about a Ms. kauflan being burned? It's true. Deep-fried and extra crispy. They're trying to keep it quiet. Oh, professor. - Hi. - Diana Collins. Sure. Would you like me to ring up to her room? No, thanks, I'll just get a room number. Actually, she just went over to zeta lambda. Really? Yeah. Her and Elinor Smith, they're working on an assignment together. Pizza! Pizza my place! Uh, Diana and Elinor? I don't think so. No, believe it. Heading over to the party, so if you, uh, see Katie... - Yeah, I'll tell her. - Thank you. ♪ I was born in a shoebox ♪ ♪ Livin' in a shoe by the time I was five ♪ ♪ I was moved outside to the backyard right beside... ♪ ♪ Junkyard in between a bank and a courthouse ♪ ♪ Guarded by a mean old dog who would run down the alley way ♪ ♪ Chasing us back to the oak tree up in the backyard over by the house ♪ ♪ Keep a climbin' in the shoebox where I was born ♪ Just a minute. ♪ I was 15 going on 25 ♪ Sure, come in. ♪ In the back seat of a trans am with the tape deck busted ♪ ♪ Dag gone radio playing everything but the hit songs ♪ ♪ In the summertime on a Saturday we'll take the highway down to the lake ♪ ♪ Throw a spring made of color and a bucket of ice ♪ ♪ In the sunshine sippin' on the moonshine sure beats sleepin' in the shoebox ♪ Where's Diana?

There's some seriously twisted shit in here. And the persian stuff is even sicker. We have to try and help di. I know all this stuff has something to do with barash. Look, all we can do is stick by her until she... Hey, um, I gotta double-check something back in my room. Let's book. He's probably nursing his inner child in some bar. Hi! Hey, 9w5- okay, fine. Yeah, she's really hot. - Is she back? - Room 432. That way. Hey, let me... Shit. Hello, professor. What are you doing up here? Social call. Anyone I know? Intimately. Look, professor, whether you're aware of it or not, di's dealing with some pretty heavy issues right now. I know she doesn't need you adding to them. What I know, young man, would make you insane. I trust my girlfriend, professor. Do you, indeed? Implicitly. I see. Well, certainly, I want what's best for Diana too, and if you wish it, I will leave you in peace. I thank you. Tell her: Three wishes. Otherwise the souls closest to her will perish... Horribly. Run and tell, little boy. You okay? Diana was right about barash. What the hell are you talking about? Diana was right. I saw it. Saw what? Barash is not barash. All that crazy shit that Diana was talking about is true. What? He's after Diana. - Where the hell is Billy? - I don't know! When you find him, bail. We gotta get off the campus. - Hi. - Sorry. Diana, that's my line. He's gonna kill us. Not a chance. I know someone who can help. Father Norton! - Can we... - Father Norton's a little tied up. Diana, why do I get the feeling you're avoiding me? A church... so predictable. Common human frailty thinking that god cares. He doesn't. You're on your own. That's the downside to free will. What do you want from me? I want to Grant you every wish, fulfill your every desire. - Oh, like you did the professor? - You're a very brave girl. Do you think Greg will be so strong? He has nothing to do with this. Well, he doesn't have to. Not if you make your wishes. You can't kill us if we don't make a wish. Where'd you get that, from one of your textbooks? Let's go. Oh, Ann! Sorry, Diana. You got bumped. I'm the professor's t.A. Now. No, Ann, listen to me. - Too late for that. Ann's already made her wish. Professor. She wants to lose a little weight. Make your wish. No. Your decision. - What's happening? - Just a little liposuction. Anorexia's such a debilitating disease, don't you think? And now, her stomach. You've always thought of that as your problem area, haven't you? Only you can help her, Diana. Make it stop! God, make it stop! [Gagging 1 are you gonna fail your friend like you failed your parents? Failed them with your selfishness? With your childish whining and your cowardice as they burned alive? No. Only you can ease her pain, Diana. Only you can save her. - Make your wish! - Okay! Just stop her pain, please. I wish it. - You lying piece of shit! - You said... Hey! I stopped the pain. You have to be more specific. Now make your second wish. Never! - Ah! - How many friends do you have, Diana? Make a wish! - Don't trust him. - Silence! Make the wish while you still have time! I wish to invoke the spirit of the angel Michael to help me stop you. Clever girl. Greg. Greg. Who freed you from the pit, demon? The same girl who wished you here. - Greg? - Michael. Your misguided heroics have condemned you all. Leave here. Just like the old days, Michael. The angels running before the djinn like sheep. - We won the war. - You won the battle. The war goes on. In here. Get back! Professor, where are you going? - Wanna come to the party? - Oh, professor. - Oh, come on. - I'll catch up with you guys. Now what are you looking for? Will you please turn around? What do you want? I have a thing for older men. I'm older than you can ever imagine. Oh, come on, professor. That's exactly what makes you so attractive. I'm sick of all these brain-dead, post-pubescent horn dogs. They're so easy to toy with. But you, you strike me as a man who could break a girl's heart. Do you wish me to break your heart, younglady? Oh, yes, please. As you wish. No! Elinor's dead. The djinn will use your friends against you. Is Greg dead? I sense him... Somewhere. Can we bring him back? Only if we defeat the djinn. And we might have in the church, had your man kept his head. What Greg did, he did because... Can he hear me? I don't know. Greg? Oh, god, you're bleeding. It'll pass. Where are you going? To get some water to clean you up. Can I have my hand back? Thank you. You guys seen Katie York? You guys seen Katie York? Has anybody seen Katie York? Lift your arm. Enough! This isn't your body. It's his, and mine. So don't forget that. You summoned the demon, woman. These wounds should be the least of your concerns. When I touched the stone, I didn't know that... That much is clear, woman. Would you stop with this "woman" thing? You have released a demon and started a war that could burn down the gates of heaven. I didn't wish for you to come down here and give me a lecture. I wished for you to come down here and help me kill the djinn. I can't. What? Only the waker may kill the djinn. Perfect. Is Katie in there? Katie? Come on. Open up. Katie? Diana? Hello? Guys? - We must run. - That's it? That's your plan? No weapon from this world can kill the djinn. That's not from this world. The sword of justice will be yours when you are ready. - He's in my head again. - Fight it! You can shut him out. I can't! Say hello to Billy, Diana. No! Well, well, well. What are you doing here? Where's Diana? That's funny. I was about to ask you the same thing. You know who I am? Yeah, you're some lame-ass professor who's got a thing for his students. Oh, shit. I can spare your life. What, if I sell you my soul? Where is she? Screw you! Shall we try again? - Let me pass. I have to help Billy. - That's what he wants. - But Billy... - Is already dead. I can't hear you. What is your wish? Blow me. Granted. God! Help me! Do you like your wish, Billy? Did you get what you wanted? All right, you win. Stop the pain, please! Ask Diana. She's the only one who can help you. - Ask her. Go on. - Make it stop! I can't. Fascinating. Katie, isn't it? No! You leave me no choice, Diana. Make your third wish. You touch her and I'll rip your fucking heart out! - I don't have a heart. - I swear to god, whatever it takes. Save us both a lot of trouble and make your wish. Never. Katie, where are you? You're stronger than I give you credit for. Strong but powerless. - We have to leave them. - I'm not leaving without Katie. - The djinn will use her to get to you. - I don't care. Come on, Katie. Pick up! She's gonna die unless we do something. If the djinn grants your third wish, the earth will become a living hell. Sacrifices must be made. It is the only way. Give me the sword. - You're not ready. - Says who? Would you give your life to save the world? That was foolish. When you can hold the sword, you will be ready. Until then, we must evade him. Katie doesn't have until then. Either you let me pass, or you and I fight as well. As you wish. Please don't say that word. You in there, di? Uh, no! No! Pick up! Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women... Oh, no. No! No! Get out. Get out. Katie? You can come out. I'm not gonna hurt you. [ Door opens I. - Hello? - Di, it's me. - Katie, where are you? - Oh god! Science building, third floor. I don't know what room exactly. I saw Billy. Okay, we're coming right now. Just stay put. We'll find you. No, I'm totally exposed. He's gonna find me. We'll be there in two minutes. I wish there was somewhere to hide. Your wish is my command. Katie? Katie? No! No! No! - No! - Nobody will find you in there, my dear. No! God, no! Katie? Katie? Katie, where are... [ Gasps 1 oh, my god! Katie? Where's your angel now, Diana? Hmm? This is your fault. What did you do to her? Nothing she didn't wish for. You can make it stop, Diana. You can make her whole again. - I'm sorry, Katie. - [ Gagging 1 make the wish, Diana! Spare your friend! No! Katie? Katie. - Come on. - I'm not leaving without Katie! It's too late. - Save yourself. - I'm not leaving without you. I have the sword. You have nothing. Go. I'll join you. You have my word. Time to die. Shit! Come here. Strap yourself in. Greg? Michael. Michael, get out of the car. Come on. We gotta get out of the car. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. You okay? - Leave me. - No. Come on. Oh, my god. Mm. Mmm. You gonna condemn him like all the others? No. Make your wish. Make your wish! If the waker dies before the third wish, the djinn's defeated. Don't. No! No! It's over. You've lost. No. No! No! Diana. Only why- thank you. Greg? He'! - I love you.
