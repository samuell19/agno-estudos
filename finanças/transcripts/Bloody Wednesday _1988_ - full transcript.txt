(synth music) - [Man] The evening news on television keeps reminding us we live in a violent world. After sundown most of us try to keep off the streets and stay out of public parks. We feel safe in our homes behind locked doors. The last place we would feel threatened is our neighborhood coffee shop. The film you are about to see depicts what happened in one of these coffee shops. (dramatic synth music) (drill whirring) - [Jake] Mr. Grady, how you doin'? - Hi, Jake. My car's ready, I assume. - Should be. Your mechanic is Harry. You'll find him in the back. - Okay, thanks Jake. You Harry? - [Man] No, he's over there. (tools clanking) (men talking indistinctly) (briefcase thudding) - My car. My car! Jake! Where's the motor? Jake, there's no motor in this car! My car! (fist pounding) - [Jake] For god's sake, Harry. You knew Mr. Grady was gonna be here at four o'clock! What's the matter with you? - I can't. - [Jake] You can't what? - I can't put it together. - Well, why not? - I forgot. - You've taken apart and put together a hundred cars like this. Now how could you forget? - Nothin' fits. Nothin' fits. - [Mr. Grady] I'm gonna sue you, Jake. - Look, Mr. Grady, what if I loan you another car? - [Mr. Grady] No, no way. You'll hear from my attorney. - Mr. Grady, you can have your pick. - [Mr. Grady] No. - Nothing fits. - Ben? Jake. Come get your brother. Somethin's wrong. Real wrong. Yeah. Right now! (phone slamming) - All right, Harry, out with it. You been drinkin'? Smokin' somethin'? Takin' pills? - Nothing like that. I just can't make things fit anymore. - What the hell you mean they don't fit? All them parts are made to fit. Anything comes apart fits together again. - You don't understand, Ben. You just don't understand. - Make me understand. Go ahead. Make me understand. - It's me. I don't fit. If I don't fit, how can I make anything else fit? - Get him out of here! He's fired! - Don't hate me, Ben. Let's go home. (soft dramatic synth music) Sunday's Mother's Day. Let's go to the cemetery and put some flowers on her grave. - I'd like that. - Yeah. Oh, I forgot. I promised Annie I'd take her and her mother to Disneyland on Sunday. Look, we'll do it some other time. I gotta run, Harry. Got an appointment.

No, wait. What? No! No! (congregation murmuring) - [Pastor] Play again. - Can you give me any reason, Mrs. Curtis, why your husband would appear totally naked in church? - He's not my husband. We're divorced. I have no idea why Harry would do anything so crazy. Is he crazy, Doctor? - We don't use that term in the medical profession. - Sounds crazy to me. - You don't seem to care much about his welfare. - He can drop dead for all I care. - Was he cruel to you? Did he beat you? - None of that. Harry is a loser. I gave him the best six years of my life. Like I said, he's a born loser. I don't want anything to do with him. - We can't just turn him loose in the streets. He should have a place to go and someone to be with for awhile. - Well, don't look at me. - You can go now, Mrs. Curtis. - He isn't dangerous, is he? - That'll be all, Mrs. Curtis. (soft synth music) - You're in the psychiatric ward of the county hospital. You are locked up and you cannot leave until you're certified of being capable of taking care of yourself. After my initial examination, I filed a report. I said you were dangerous, a walking time bomb. - I don't feel dangerous. - You don't feel anything. That's sick. - Maybe you're the one that's sick. Been hangin' around with too many loonies. - You refuse to communicate. You behave as though you're all alone in this world. - You got it all wrong, Doc. I don't follow little girls into the park. I'm not about to mug some old lady. The only thing I use a knife for is to cut bread. I don't hate anyone. - If you were 80, Harry, I could buy that, but you're 30. You're strong, full of energy. Try plugging up a spout of a tea kettle under a big flame. It blows up. - If it gets too hot, get out of the kitchen. - The whole world's one big kitchen. There's nowhere to hide. - So where do I run? - You don't. You adapt. It's the only way to survive. Adapt. - I'll get a job. Eat three meals a day, get plenty of exercise and take my vitamin C. - Don't smart-ass me. - Well then stop buggin' me! My brother Ben will have vouched for me. He's an accountant. He's a big deal CPA. - I've spoken to your brother. He's left the decision to me. - So test me. Besides, I thought I passed all your tests. - [Doctor] You did. - So why am I still here? - I have a gut feeling you're not ready. - Maybe it's something you ate. I'm sayin' all the wrong things. (Harry sighing) - Unfortunately, Harry, we're overcrowded in this facility, and I have no legal right to detain you any further. I'm going to do this against my better judgment. I'm going to release you on probation, but you'll have to report to me twice a week for the next three months. - Thanks, Doc. (dramatic synth music) - [Ben] Hotel's been closed for a few years. I keep the books for the owner, so you can stay here as long as you want. (horns honking) Well, Harry. How do you feel, Harry? - [Harry] I'm all right. - Harry, I put a bell on the telephone on the desk in the lobby. Now, there's a furnished suite. It's up on the top floor. I put a telephone in that suite, also, so call me if you need me, huh? Look, this is the front door key. Keep the doors locked. I gotta get back to my office. Harry, I'll stop by your apartment. I'll pick up your things and bring 'em over later tonight. Come on, I'll show you where the kitchen is. (creepy synth music) Now remember, like I said, keep all the doors locked. I stocked the kitchen with plenty of food. I was here this morning. I don't remember putting up any coffee. - [Harry] Coffee? Well, I could use a cup of coffee. - Hey, how come you went to that church naked? - Um, I heard the church bells. They woke me up, and it was Sunday morning, so I figured I might as well go to church. - Yeah, but why didn't you wear any clothes? - I thought I was dressed. I mean, it's never happened to me before. It could happen to anybody, Ben. - Could only happen to you. I have to get back to my office. (elevator bell chiming) (suspenseful synth music) (baby crying) (suspenseful synth music) - No more! You're gonna die! You're all gonna die! No more! No more. (furniture thudding) (men growling) (dramatic synth music) - No, this is not a prank call. I'm serious. (Ben speaking indistinctly) I'll meet you by the front door. Get here as quick as you can. (dramatic synth music) - [Thug] Look it here. The hell you doing here? - Hey, sleaze bag. - Hey, fag. Faggot. (sirens wailing) (can clanking) - [Thug] Come on. Go! (sirens wailing) (dramatic synth music) - [Dispatcher] 21, 21. - Tough! (man grunting) Big man with a gun, right? - Inside. - Right? - You did the smart thing calling the police and not trying to apprehend them yourself. You're a good citizen, Mr. Curtis. - You're a dead man. (man screaming indistinctly) (police chatter) (door slamming) (knuckles rapping) - [Woman] Please open the door, please! Please open, open the door, please! Open the door, please! He's after me! Please open the door! Please! - [Harry] Who are you? - [Woman] Please, he's after me! Please open the door, please! Please! Please! Hurry! - [Harry] No, not till you tell me who you are. - [Woman] Please! Ah, he's coming! He's coming! Please! Please, he's coming! Please! Please! Please! Please! (locks rattling) (dramatic synth music) (footsteps clomping) (door slamming) (locks clicking) (light clicking) (water running) (suspenseful synth music) (water running) (suspenseful synth music) (faucet handle squeaking) (water dripping) (fists pounding) (dramatic synth music) - What the hell is this? What are you doing with that wrench? (wrench clattering) - I heard some strange noises outside. There was somebody pounding on my door. - You been drinkin', Harry? - No, I don't drink. - The hotel's empty. Nobody was pounding on your door. (wind howling) - Maybe I dreamt it. - You scared the hell out of me. (wind howling) Look, you've got a free place to flop. Just play it cool. Let's not blow it. - Okay. I'll be real quiet. - Good. I'll call you in a day or two, huh? (wind howling) (door closing) (child-like piano music) - I missed you, Teddy. You'll be all right here. - [Teddy] I don't like this place. - It'll have to do for awhile. - [Teddy] How long, Harry? - Till I can find a job. - [Teddy] You can't hold a job. You're always gettin' fired. - Don't worry. Things will work out fine this time. You'll see. (child-like piano music) (wind howling) (creepy synth music) (Harry groaning) (wind howling) (creepy synth music) (Harry groaning) (snake hissing) (Harry groaning) (snake hissing) (creepy synth music) (wind howling) (snake hissing) (creepy synth music) (wind howling) (snake hissing) - No! No! (snake hissing) (creepy synth music) (Harry groaning) (snake hissing) (Harry groaning) (creepy synth music) - Uh! Oh! No! (snake hissing) (creepy synth music) (Harry whimpering) (Harry grunting) (snake hissing) (dramatic synth music) (Harry grunting) (phone buzzing) (creepy synth music) - [Woman] Hello? This is room 1327. Could you please send up a pot of coffee? - Pot of coffee? - [Woman] Right away, please. (phone buzzing) (soft synth music) (bell ringing) (suspenseful synth music) (bell ringing) (soft dramatic music) - 1327 ordered a pot of coffee. - You're new here, aren't you? - How long have you been working here? - I started here the first night this hotel opened over 40 years ago. Been here all my life. Only job I ever had. - One job your whole life? - Lucky, I guess. - What about 1327? She ordered coffee. - We don't rent that room anymore. Years ago someone rented 1327 and jumped out the window. Three months later there was a repeat. Since then, 1327 has been locked up. There's no one there. (keys jangling) (creepy synth music) (knuckles rapping) (keys jangling) (bright blues music) - [Harry] What are you doing here? - I'm a guest. Who are you? - Security. - Doors are made to knock on. Now what is it? - How did you get in? The hotel's closed. - I registered at the desk. What's wrong with you? (phone ringing) That must be my husband. Hello? - [Man] Mrs. Wilson? - Yes. - [Man] There was an accident. - [Mrs. Wilson] Yes? - [Man] All four were killed, including your husband and your daughter. - My daughter? (suspenseful synth music) - No. No, no. No! (woman screaming) (dramatic synth music) (water splashing) (dramatic synth music) She jumped. - That was 28 years ago. - But the robe. I tried to stop her, but she jumped. - 28 years ago. - Harry, what the hell are you talkin' about? There's nobody in that hotel but you. Bellboy? What bellboy? Listen, there ain't no bellboy and nobody's ordering room service. The hotel's empty, I tell ya. You hear me? Empty. Just pull yourself together. Stop talkin' like a nut. Well, where are ya? In bed? Get out of bed and take a hot bath. No, no, I can't come over today. I just got too many appointments. Look, get out of bed, take a hot bath and get some rest. (imitating plane rumbling and gunfire) (objects rustling and thudding) (dramatic synth music) - [Thug] We're gonna get you, mister! (dramatic synth music) (men screaming) Gonna get you! (door thudding) Come on! (dramatic synth music) - [Harry] Oh! Oh! Oh! Help! Help! Help. (Harry grunting) (door thudding) (dramatic music) - [Thug] Where is he? (sirens wailing) - The pigs! (sirens wailing) (Harry grunting) - He'll be all right. I'll take care of him. Thanks for your help. - You'll have to come down to the station to sign the report. - I'll get down there as soon as I can. Could you leave us alone? Thanks again for your help. What were you doing on that ledge? - I wasn't trying to jump. - You were naked, the same way you went to church that day. Damn it, can't you keep your clothes on? - I told you. I was in the bathtub when it happened. - I don't want to hear what happened. I want you to keep your clothes on and I want you to stay inside the hotel. Geez, why does all this have to happen to me? Well. What the hell? (soft synth music) - How did you get here? - Over the wall. - [Doctor] I want you to leave. - Don't be afraid. I'm not gonna hurt you. - If you don't leave, I'm calling the police. - Go ahead. - [Doctor] What is it you want? - You invited me. - I did no such thing. - So I invited myself. Stop looking at me like I'm an animal. - All right, you wanna talk? Talk. - I didn't come here to talk. (soft synth music) I'm in one cold ass suite. I haven't played in years. - Go ahead. (cup clinking) (bright piano music) - Harry. Harry. Harry. (bright piano music) - Thought you liked it. - [Doctor] Liked what, Harry? - Last Thursday. - [Doctor] What about last Thursday? - You don't remember? - [Doctor] I don't know what you're talking about. - I came to your house. - You must've dreamt it. - I didn't dream it. Why are you denying it? - You actually believe you came to my house? And you believe you spent the night with me? Harry, listen to me carefully. You never came to my house. We never spent the night together. It never was. I wouldn't lie to you. The worst thing I could do is make you believe something didn't happen if it did. Please believe me. You nod, but you still don't believe me. (plane rumbling) (Harry imitating plane rumbling and gunfire) (guns firing on television) (phone buzzing) - FBI. FBI, may we come in? Got a report that someone from the top floor has been aiming a rifle at a passing plane. - The hotel's closed. I'm the only one here. - Well, where do you stay? - Upstairs. - Do you own a rifle? - No. - Can we see your room? (dramatic synth music) (light clicking) (soft synth music) Did you aim this broomstick at the plane? - There's no law against playing with a broomstick, but it's a bad idea. - I wouldn't do it again if I were you. - Should we write him up? - I think it would look silly on a report. Let's just drop it. - [FBI Man] Goodnight. (suspenseful synth music) (thugs rustling) - [Harry] Shit. - [Thug] Cut him off! Grab him! (dramatic synth music) Go! (dramatic synth music) (gate rattling) (Harry panting) (dramatic synth music) (Harry grunting) (Harry panting) Check the door on the right. (dramatic synth music) Come on. Let's check in here. (Harry grunting) (dramatic synth music) Go that way. (steam hissing) (dramatic synth music) - Ah! (door thudding) (dramatic synth music) - [Harry] No! (door thudding) (chair clattering) (Harry panting) (dramatic synth music) (Harry choking) - This ain't nothin'! (Harry grunting) (thug grunting) Ow! (dramatic synth music) (chain rattling) (shoulder thudding) (door thudding) - No place to run now, is there? What do you think, a teddy bear's gonna help ya, huh? What? We got ya now. (pipe thudding) (creepy synth music) - Hello, boys. You're going to die. Now that we're all here, you're all going to die. We've heard the evidence, Your Honor. All that's left is to pronounce judgment. - You never got a chance! - Silence! (thug whimpering) (gun clicking) (suspenseful music) (gun cylinder spinning) (man panic breathing) (suspenseful music) - Your verdict, Your Honor? - [Teddy] Guilty! (thug whimpering) (gun clicking) - Lucky. (gun cylinder spinning) (thug spitting) (gun cylinder spinning) - [Harry] Your verdict, Your Honor? - [Teddy] Guilty! - Guilty? - I didn't hear-- - [Harry] Guilty? - I didn't hear nothin'! (gun clicking) (dramatic synth music) - Lucky again. (gun cylinder spinning) What's your verdict, Your Honor? - [Teddy] Not guilty! - Not guilty? Are you sure, Teddy? - [Teddy] Not guilty. (dramatic synth music) (gun firing) (drywall crumbling) - Boy, are you lucky. (upbeat pop music) - I tell ya, the guy's nuts. He played Russian roulette on us. - You had no right to be there. - The guy's a weirdo. It ain't safe to walk the streets with this guy loose. He gave us a bad time. - The faggot! He ruined my best pair of jeans. - Yeah, well you still stink. Go take a shower. - We'll get him. - He's a dead man. (doorbell ringing) - [Doctor] Who is it? - [Harry] It's me. Harry. - [Doctor] Come in. - I gotta know something right off. Is this for real? - This is for real, Harry. - You're not gonna throw me out? - No, I'm not going to throw you out. - And I'm not disturbing you? - No, I couldn't sleep. Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Can I get you something to drink? - Uh, no thanks. - Don't you find it's a little odd for you to come here at this hour? - No, I don't pay any attention to time. Mind if I just sort of stay here until morning? - No, you can sleep on the couch. I'll get you a pillow and blanket. (Harry sighing) (soft piano music) Harry? - [Harry] I should be going. - [Doctor] Harry. Your bedding is on the couch. - Why bother? - I wanna be friends. Look, I forgot to have dinner tonight. How about you? (soft piano music) - Hell, I can always eat. What have you got in the fridge? - [Doctor] Let's see what we have in here. Cheese, milk. - Tell you what, I'll put the coffee on. - You know something, Harry? - [Harry] Hmm? - I've never been to a dance. - Well, you know, my wife and I used to be pretty fair dancers. Tell you what. I'll take you dancing. - You see? There's hope for both of us. (cup shattering) That's for good luck, Harry. Here's one for me. (cup shattering) - You are one hell of a sweet, Doc. - [Jake] Hey, Harry. How you been? - Jake, I need my job back. - I don't know. You know, I almost got canned? You cost us our best account. We lost a whole fleet of trucks 'cause of you. - Hell, Jake, you know I'm the best mechanic in this garage. - Well, you were. - I gotta go back to work. Jake, I'm beggin' ya. - Look, I don't own this joint. I'm only the manager. How am I gonna explain it to the boss? - Don't tell him until I make good. - [Jake] Uh, no. I just can't take that chance. - Jake. Jake, take me back, or something bad is gonna happen. - Now what are you gonna do? Burn this joint down? - I might. Give me a break. - I hate to see a man beg. Look, it's pretty slow in the repair department, but, um, well, you used to be pretty good in the paint shop. - I'll do anything you say. I swear I will. - Hey, Fred! Set Harry up in the paint shop! - [Fred] Okay, Jake. - Thanks, Jake. - Hey, Fred. Is Harry finished with that blue paint job? - Sure did, Jake. Should be finished by now. (doors rumbling) (dramatic synth music) - What? Red, white and blue? Holy Moses, you... What is this? - She's a beauty, huh, Jake? Well, Fred told me to paint it straight blue, but I figured, hell, every car is blue, green or black. But this, this is really somethin'. - Fred! George! Why did I do it? I should've known better! When are you gonna learn, Jake? When are you gonna learn? You. Get! Throw him out. Throw him on the street! Get him out of here! (dramatic synth music) (fist pounding) (bell ringing) - [Sidney] You wanted something, Mr. Curtis? - [Harry] I'm desperate, Sidney. - What seems to be the problem? - I've met a girl, and for the first time in my life, I've got a chance. But I have to show her that I can make good. - I presume you're speaking of money, Mr. Curtis. - That's it, Sidney. I need a big chunk of dough. - I don't have any. - I know that, but you've been around a long time. You must've had lots of opportunities. Just give me a tip and I'll take care of the rest. - I have seen opportunities to get rich quick, but they're always dangerous. - I'm willing to stake my life. - You recall my telling you about the two suicides from room 1327? - I saw the lady jump. - The other was a man, a jewelry salesman from New York. His name was Walter Burns. He came once a year carrying a suitcase full of uncut diamonds. He always rented the same suite, 1327. He stayed for a week and sold from the room. Never left the hotel. His last trip here I met him in the lobby. I was the only one permitted to carry his suitcase. That very night, he jumped to his death. The full suitcase of uncut diamonds has never been found. - Maybe someone stole it. - No. I carried it to his room, laid it on his bed. He tipped me, I left, and he bolted the door from the inside. He had no visitors that evening. - How can you be sure? - He always hired the house detective, Lou Kramer, to come sit in the corridor all night next to his door. Lou said that Mr. Burns was in his room alone till he jumped. - Then the diamonds are still in the hotel! - They most certainly are. - Well, how come you never found them? - Well, I've looked. But everybody's searched, but no one ever found where Mr. Burns hid them. - What good is that gonna do me? - You ask if I knew an opportunity to get rich quick. - We could look for them together. I'll split it with you, Sidney. - I've lost my taste for money, Mr. Curtis, but I'll give you a lead. - Anything, please. I need something. - Mr. Burns still walks around this hotel. - You said he committed suicide. - Oh, for a few of us, we can still make contact, and you're one of the few, Harry. Why don't you find Mr. Burns, talk to him? He's kept this secret these many years. Maybe he'll confide in you. - Well, how can I find this Mr. Burns? I've never seen him around here. - I'd go to his room. 1327. - I've had some bad experiences in 1327. - You said you were desperate. I warn you, it's a risky business. (soft synth music) (door closing) (water dripping) - What can I do for ya, Harry? - [Harry] Sidney the bellboy told me I could find you here. - Yes. - [Harry] It's about your suitcase. - Sidney told you about my suitcase? - He said that they hadn't found it. - You're welcome to search for it, Harry. - What chance have I got if nobody else found it? I need you to tell me where it is. - Why should I do that, Harry? Why? We're strangers. - Mr. Burns, I'm in a bad way. I'm so bad off I have to turn to strangers. Beginning to feel like you felt the night that you jumped. - I didn't jump! I was pushed. The house detective, Lou Kramer, he sneak into my room in the middle of the night and pushed me out the window! But I fooled him. Yes, I fooled him. He never found the suitcase. (suspenseful music) - What could I do? Where do I find this Kramer? - Have you noticed strange footsteps in the corridor? Coffee pots still brewing in the kitchen? Lights left on. Cigar butts still smoking. That's Kramer. Every night he stands out in the street and watches your room till the lights go out, and then, then he sneaks into my room and searches for my suitcase. You want that suitcase, Harry? Kill him. (dramatic piano music) (door closing) (wind howling) (hammer tapping) (door creaking) - Who are you? - Security. What are you doing here? - I'm lookin' for a lost article. - The suitcase? - Maybe. - You never give up, do you? - I know it's still here somewhere. - That suitcase belongs to Walter Burns. - He's dead. It belongs to anyone who finds it. - He promised it to me. - Dead men's promises are no good. - You remember how he died? - I remember. - You should. You murdered him. - Where'd you hear that? - Isn't it true? - Hey, mister, that was so long ago, that's ancient history. - You didn't answer my question. - He jumped! You can read it in the police report! - You filed that police report. - [Lou] Just what the hell do you want? - The suitcase was never found. It belongs to me. - [Lou] Hey, if you're lookin' for a split, forget it. It's all mine! (blinds rattling) What'd you do that for? (suspenseful music) - I'm gonna murder you. - You're crazy, man. - Move. There's a pool 13 stories down. If you're lucky, you'll just break your neck. - Hey, you can keep the suitcase. The diamonds are all yours. Just let me get the hell outta here! I promise! I'll never come back! I give you my word of honor! Lou Kramer's word of honor! (gun firing) (water splashing) (soft dramatic music) - A bargain's a bargain. It's all yours. (door closing) (snakes hissing) (dramatic music) - Oh, god! God, no. (traffic humming) (pipe thudding) - Let's you and me take a walk. You know somethin' bad is gonna happen. You just don't know when. So sweat a little, just like you made us sweat at the hotel. I could've wasted you right in the street, but I didn't 'cause it's more fun bringin' ya here. (pool balls clattering) What were you lookin' at in the window? Machine gun? Like to have it, wouldn't you? (pool ball clattering) Well, how you holdin'? Show me your green. (ring clattering) That wouldn't even buy the bullets. - It's all I got. - What are you gonna do with a machine gun? - [Harry] I don't know. - Now this is the best persuader in the world. Forget it. Guns are no good. You get caught with a gun, you wind up in the slammer for a long stretch. Even knives are bad. Even knives are bad. But with this baby right here, the pigs pick you up, you throw it in the gutter. DA's got no case. You were unarmed. System complains you mugged him. You claim he's a fag and he tried to proposition you. You had to rough him up a little. Judge sends you walkin' with a warnin'. Forget guns. They're no good. You still want that gun in the window? I'm gonna get it for ya. You know why? Guess. You can't figure it out, so I'll spell it. There's a lot of fat citizens in this town who think they've got it made with their gold chains and their Mercedes and their credit cards. I hate the bastards and the crumbs they throw ya. 3.35 an hour, minimum wage? Shit man, I eat steak every night. Costs me 15 bucks. My body needs the protein. I'd starve to death at 3.35 an hour. So get a job, get an education, learn a skill so they can pay you four bucks an hour. I mugged a man the other day for $1500. Took me two minutes. That's earnin' power. And this is the best persuader in the world. You point a gun and some of 'em don't believe it's loaded. Use a knife, they wanna fight. But one smash in the mouth with this and they got a 4000 buck dentist bill. Are you readin' me, man? I'm tryin' to educate you. What the hell are you gonna do with a machine gun? - Use it. (sinister music) (soft dramatic music) (Harry grunting) - Past noon and you're still in bed? Still the same Harry. - [Harry] What are you doin' here? - I'm your wife. The divorce isn't final for six months. - [Harry] How'd you get into the hotel? - Your brother Ben called. He gave me a key. He asked me to look after you. - [Harry] Yeah, well you walked out on me. I can take care of myself. - You never could take care of yourself. - I sure can't take care of you. - You have free rent here. My lease is up. I'll stay here till we find another place. - Don't open that! (snakes hissing) - [Elaine] Why not? - Don't! (dramatic synth music) - I decided we'll make a fresh start, Harry. - [Harry] What, go back with you? - [Elaine] You want to go back to that nuthouse? - [Harry] They can't take me back. - Oh, no? You're out on probation in your brother's custody. Ben transferred that custody to me. - Ben wouldn't do that. - He did. Do you want to see the papers? If you want to stay out, you better behave yourself. - [Harry] Rather be back in there for the rest of my life than go back with you. - You once said you loved me, that you couldn't live without me. What's changed you, Harry? Who is she? Who is she? Who is she? - Just someone I met. - You mean someone you picked up. - She wasn't a pick up. - No? Were you properly introduced? - [Harry] You make everything sound so dirty. - Have you slept with her? - [Harry] I've never even kissed her. - True love. Are you in love with her? - [Harry] What if I am? - Forget it. You're never going to see her again. - [Harry] You can't stop me. - I can stop her. She's supposed to be your doctor. I can sue her for seducing my husband. - You are a bitch. - If I am, you made me one. - [Harry] Can't you see we're no good for each other? - You're no bundle of joy, but we did have some good times. - If we did, I don't remember. - [Elaine] You want to be with this hustler? - Why are you doing this to me? - Did it ever occur to you that maybe I had some feelings left? I loved you once. I married you. (Harry sighing) Doesn't that mean anything to you, Harry? - A lot's happened since you left. I'm not the same person I used to be. - You look the same to me. - Well, believe me, I'm not. (zipper unzipping) (bright blues music) - [Elaine] It's this hustler. She's poisoned your mind against me. - [Harry] I've hardly even discussed you with her. (bright blues music) - You want to see her again? You're finished with her. You hear me? Shh. You hear me? Finished. (bright blues music) You're never going to see her again. (bright blues music) When's the last time you were with a woman? (bright blues music) I'm going to take a bath. Why don't you shave? Look, you're young, you're healthy. You're a skilled mechanic. Skilled mechanic's earn a living. We'll get a new apartment and a new car, and live like real people. If you want to stay out of the nuthouse, you'll work hard and prove to me you're still a solid citizen. Why don't you shave? I don't want to feel your beard in bed. Look, I got this doctor's private phone number. You're going to call her in my presence and tell her to get lost. Tell her if she tries to see you or even call you again, I'll ruin her. Are you listening to me, Harry? Harry, will you undo my strap? Harry? (dramatic synth music) Harry! (Harry grunting) - Die. Die! Die! Die! (both screaming) - [Elaine] Harry! - Die! (dramatic synth music) (Harry screaming) Die! Die! (water sloshing) (Harry panting) (dramatic synth music) (water dripping) (elevator doors rattling) It's been a terrible day, Teddy. - [Teddy] Maybe tomorrow will be better. - Tomorrow? Only rich people have tomorrows. - [Teddy] Doesn't anybody care what happens to us? - I doubt if anyone knows we're alive. All I know is that we have to stay here. (knuckles rapping) - Harry? It's Ben. Open up. Who's here? - I'm alone. - I heard you talkin' to somebody. - Nobody's here. - I heard another voice answering you. What's that doing here? - It's Teddy. Teddy's been with me a long time, Ben. Don't you remember? - You were talking to him, weren't you? - Yeah. - I suppose he talks back to you. - Sometimes. - You know teddy bears can't talk. - I know. - So how can you carry on a conversation with him? How long you been doing this? - Since I was a kid. - That's why you kept him. - Teddy and I have been through a lot, Ben. You know, he's more of a friend to me than you are. - [Ben] That's gratitude. That's the thanks I get for taking care of you? - Sorry to be such a bother, Ben. - I got bad news, Harry. They sold the hotel. A wrecking crew's coming to tear it down. You'll have to move. - Move? Where am I gonna move? - [Ben] You'll have to find another place. - Where? - I don't know! Harry, you gotta shape up. I don't know how much longer I can help you. Look, I'm a mess. I played the market and I guessed wrong. I'm broke. If Ann finds out, she's gonna throw me out. - I'm sorry for your troubles, Ben. - Yeah. Sometimes I wonder whether it's worth it. You struggle and sweat to pile up a few bucks for your old age and you end up busted. Feel a 100 years old. Oh, it's not you. The whole system's falling apart. You know, I keep the books for 50 small corporations. They're all in hot water. Even the banks are in a mess. If they outed them right now, most of 'em would close up. - I can go to Canada, Ben. - [Ben] Canada? Takes 10 years for a foreigner to get a work permit in Canada. - Well, how about Africa or Australia? - You're not right here. You never have been. You can't go. Look, if you were older, I'd get you in a home, but right now you don't qualify. - There's gotta be someplace for me. - We should've had this talk years ago. I keep sweeping it under the rug. - Well, I could wash dishes. - They don't need dishwashers anymore. Fast food places use paper plates and throw 'em away. - I could fry hamburgers. - They only hire high school kids. - I'm not proud, Ben. If I have to, I'll beg. - You need a license to beg. You gotta be a cripple to get a license. - Ben. Make me a cripple. - That's crazy talk. - You said I wasn't right. - Well, I didn't mean that way. Did Elaine come by? (soft dramatic music) - No. - I called her. Told her about my predicament. She wants to come back to ya. - You shouldn't have done that! - I had to! Who else you got? - Don't go in there! - [Ben] I gotta take a leak. - Don't! (dramatic music) - Elaine wants you back. I guess she found out that life's not so rosy for a divorcee. Look, I know you don't want her back, but she might be good for ya right now. Be nice to her and you'll get along. You know, you don't have to love her to be nice to her. (toilet flushing) Heh, I haven't loved my wife for years and I'd be lost without her. You got no choice, Harry. You just hang in there, kid. I'm still your big brother. Don't forget that, Harry. (door opening) (door closing) (soft synth music) - No! (dramatic synth music) First of all, I used to have holes in my socks all the time, so I'd always get blisters. I could, I could never walk right. (doorbell ringing) I thought when I grew up, that that would all go away, it would change. (doorbell ringing) - Come in, Harry. I was worried you weren't coming this evening. - The hotel's being torn down. I have to get out tomorrow. - Does your brother know? - He's the one that told me. He's in big trouble himself. It's good to see you, Doc. - Come on, Harry. Sit down. (suspenseful music) - Do you hear it? - [Doctor] Hear what, Harry? - There's always a drum beating out there. Sometimes louder, sometimes softer. But it's always, always beating. - [Doctor] Since when have you heard this drum, Harry? - I don't remember when it started. You don't hear it, do you, Doc? (suspenseful music) It's going away. - [Doctor] Where will you live, Harry? - I'll stay at the airport. They won't bother you there for a couple of days. - I've been reviewing your tapes. I understand. I want to help you, but you have to show me how. You won't let me inside you. - If you could see inside my head, you'd run. - [Doctor] If you sign yourself into the hospital, I can see you ever day. - No, no, no, no! They'll never let me out! - [Doctor] Where are you going, Harry? - I got things to pack up at the hotel. I got-- - Please, stay awhile. - No. I've overstayed my welcome. (off-key piano music) (Harry banging on piano keys) I can't play. Never could. (footsteps receding) (door slamming) (phone ringing) - Chief of staff. - I've just seen Harry Curtis. He needs to be readmitted. - I'm afraid that's impossible, Doctor. - I tell you we must act immediately. - Why can't you continue treating him as an outpatient? - He's at the breaking point. - He has no police record of violence. The only thing he was admitted here for was indecent exposure. Really that's not an indication of violent tendencies. - Something must be done now. - The Supreme Court of this state has ruled that no one can commit anyone without their consent unless they are apprehended in a commission of a felony. Isn't there some way you can get him to sign himself in? - He won't do that. - You have no authority to judge anyone, Doctor. This hospital could be sued for false arrest. - Then you'll do nothing? - My hands are tied. (dramatic synth music) (bell ringing) - What? (bell ringing) Somebody help me. (bell ringing) Somebody help me. Help me! Help! Help! Help! Help me! (bell ringing) Help me! Help me! (bell ringing) (Harry sobbing) (soft synth music) (dramatic synth music) (gun thudding) - Use it. (dramatic synth music) (wind howling) (upbeat synth music) - Harry? (elevator bell chiming) (suspenseful synth music) (knuckles rapping) Harry? Harry? (suspenseful synth music) (engine rumbling) (phone ringing) - [Sergeant] Western Division, Sergeant Gregory. - [Doctor] I need to speak to someone in charge here. - Western Division, Sergeant Gregory. - [Doctor] I wanna report a dangerous man. Who's in charge? - I am. Here, fill out this form, and make sure you sign at the bottom. - I don't want to file a complaint. This man needs help. - I can't help ya, lady, until you fill out this paper. - This man is dangerous. I know, I'm a doctor. - Lady, if he's beating up on ya, come down here and file a complaint. No, I can't send anyone. The cars are all out on duty. Oh, lady, we don't look for lost dogs. - He-- - Try the Humane Society. - He has a roo-- - No, I don't have the number. - He has a room full of guns. - Maybe he's got permits. - He's armed and he's walking the streets. - He's beating up on ya? How could you be talkin' on the telephone? - You have to act now or something terrible is going to happen. - I can't process this complaint until you fill out this paper. - Western Division, Sergeant Gregory. Who broke your windows? You don't know? Anyone outside? How long? How do I know? The cars are all out on duty. (suspenseful synth music) (door closing) - Harry? Harry? Harry? (wind howling) (bell ringing) Harry, where are ya? (suspenseful synth music) (dramatic synth music) (hands smacking) (suspenseful synth music) (people laughing) (suspenseful music) (people laughing loudly) (gun cocking) (suspenseful music) (people laughing loudly) (crowd cheering) (dramatic synth music rising) (crowd talking indistinctly) (gun cocking) (waitress screaming) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (waiter screaming) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (woman screaming) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (man screaming) (electricity sparking) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (electricity sparking) (women screaming) (gun firing) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (woman screaming) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (woman screaming) (man screaming) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (man screaming) (gun clicking) (men and women screaming) (gun firing) (chef screaming) (electricity sparking) (men and women screaming) (gun firing) (electricity sparking) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (men and women screaming) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (woman screaming) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (woman screaming) (man screaming) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (men and women wailing) (gun firing) (men and women wailing) (gun firing) (men and women wailing) (heartbeat pounding) (woman sobbing) (suspenseful music) (men and women whimpering) (heartbeat pounding) (glass clattering) (heartbeat pounding) (glass crunching) (gun firing) (rain pattering) (heartbeat slowing) (heartbeat continues slowing) (heartbeat stops) (rain pattering) (dramatic synth music)
