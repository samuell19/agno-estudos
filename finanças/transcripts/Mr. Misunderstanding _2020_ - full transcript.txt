But you donâ€™t talk about this with her now Find out her taste, the characters she likes and change yourself Mmâ€¦ Donâ€™t see common things through magnifying glass because it will kill your rational thinking and lead to break up But Anu, when I ask her about her friends she tells boys names Come on!

Nothing But there are some issues Doctor, donâ€™t scare me please How long have you had back pain? Itâ€™s been there for a very long time, it comes and goes. Just recently Iâ€™m experiencing constant pain whenever I turn on the sides it hurts me a lot and I canâ€™t stand it. I seeâ€¦ Could it be a tear on the ligament or spinal card injury Doctor? Look, Iâ€™m the Doctor here Iâ€™m sorry, Doctor Are you close friends? Yes Doctorâ€¦ Itâ€™s look like your spinal cord is slightly injured Ohâ€¦ If untreated, it can become very serious Are you married? No, Doctor Have you had sex with any one? Few times, doctor Did you really finish it? No, Doctor.He is very weak in this matter Iâ€™m sorry. Girls over there told this to me last night So I'm right. Anup, you are losing your power as for as intercourse is concerned Doctor! Relax... Be cool! We can set it right Donâ€™t worry about the fees, Doctor. Iâ€™m ready to spend any amount, but he must be all right Itâ€™s okayâ€¦ but it will take some time How many days? Between six months to two years Donâ€™t worry Anup. Everything's gonna be all right Doctor, what about my sex life? Definitely it will be good Donâ€™t worry, we will clear it Nowadays better treatment and medicines are available You â€¦ you are right Doctor! Idiot! Iâ€™m sorry You've been saying sorry from the moment you came in Look here Ram! Iâ€™m in pain but donâ€™t talk like a fool You come back next month end Sure, Doctor Okay, Doctor What's this white thread? You wore on the day of our marriage as well This is a sacred thread Why are you wearing it today? Because, today is the day to replace this with a new one Nice! But you didn't wear the old one I think you threw it away it after the marriage Yes I don't really like these formalities Oh! So, today all the Indians are wearing this sacred thread? No This is not for all Indians. Then? Only for us. Us? Sorry, I can't understand Only we Brahmins, wear this one. In our country, Brahmins wear the sacred thread all the time But over here, I donâ€™t like wearing it all the time How many people in India wear this? I think about 3% of the total population Why are you wearing this? We Brahmins, are superior in community Community? Caste. There are so many castes in India We are a forward and superior cast. That's why we wear it. Oh! I see my Brahmin So, it is a Post? Absolutely. Then others? They are not superiors How are you better than others? Did your Brahmin caste invent the Electric Bulb? No Did your community people invent the Aeroplane? No Did your people invent computers? No Motor Car? Bicycle? No, nothing. Then how are you being superior? We are the representatives of God. Are you a sales rep of the Gods? Who gave you this post? What post? You told me that Brahmin post! Is it a President post? No. It's more than a President's post. Who had given this post to you? We are supreme by birth. How come one becomes superior by birth than others? Is that the other people are non superior? Yes. Who told? Our holy books. Which book is that? MANU DHARMA ! So your holy book says 3% are superior and 97% are non superior? What a shit holy book is that? You are crossing the limits! Is it your religion has certain limits to talk about that? Yes. There is a limit for everything Oh. I see Why are you getting so emotional for this? I just want to know! Look, Rosy! I never take these things really seriously It's just an annual formality, that's it I wear this for three days and then I throw it away! I don't mind you wearing it or throwing it away Then, what is your problem? I didn't like the reason you said What can I do about me being born in a superior family? Again, you are talking rubbish. What? How can some one get superior by birth? It may happen by good conduct but it's also wrong! Current society and economy may stop some one who is having good conduct to get superior You are speaking so smart! Why? Didn't you expect? Don't you remember the first time we met? Of course. In the library. I read a lot about Indian culture Is that how you know about these things? No. It's not from there. Then? Just leave me I was curious. Oh... Okay I'll get the dinner ready That's good After all, you are my wife. Yeah, true. What Ram? Are you not in a good mood? Nothing It seems something big has happened Mm.. mm.. I'm going, you stay here for sometime I'll also come Have your tea and come Rosy! I'm going One day I asked you for some tea,now everyday you are coming out with something I know that you are a foodie Mm... You also know that? Why is your friend leaving in such a hurry? He lost his mood Oh! Anup, get up! I say, get up! Okay Rosy! What happened? Leave me, Rosy! Please. Are you not wearing a belt? Yes. I wear a belt. I'm not asking about this Then? I'm asking about the white belt The holy thread? Ram is wearing it Oh.. That belt? Sorry, I'm not a Brahmin So, in your country.. you are a non superior Are you from the 97% of people in India? Yes So, you are from the normal people Yeah. I like people who are normal I don't like abnormal Abnormal is some psycho level Mm,now I understand what happened last night F**k what happened! It turns out to be my husband is a superior, Abnormal! Don't talk like this Ram is a nice guy but sometimes he doesn't know how to speak He spoke very well last night These are all small things Rosy.For this you shouldn't say he is abnormal, this or that! No, no It is'nt for that It is for the reason I didn't like Alright! Forget everything and be happy Mm.. I also heard you are not only a foodie but a good cook You know that too! Can you help me today? Why? Will your friend not wait until you meet him? I really don't know where he went Then, youâ€™ll help me Okay Tell me what to cook? Any Indian dish you like Have you got all the spices? Of course Yeah There's not a single day that Ram has been in this house and I've enjoyed like this He is always like this from childhood The girl who marries you will be really lucky I'm thinking of living together without marriage I could've lived like that as well Looking at you, it would be good if we live together But I'm your friend's wife Sorry It's just a thought I like you too... But, because of that No No No problem I'll go Okay Rosy, I'll leave Thank you for being here today Take care You too Take care of your friend So, she embraced you Just within a short time after I left Why are you asking the same question again and again? I'm sorry She only checked whether I wore the holy thread She could've asked. Why did she touch you? Hey! She is perfectly normal Then, am I abnormal? She is a good woman, believe me She is a good woman because she embraced you Hey! You are intoxicated Are you not having a kick? You are a useless fellow! Neither you will have a kick nor you are fit for a f**k Don't talk about my inability! Then what? Are you a good friend? What happened? Let me have the kick Then only I can talk to you man to man Good Now you tell me whether Rosy is a good girl Hey Ram! Don't doubt your wife again and again If you want me to do anything else, I have to rape Rosy Even if she volunteers, you can't do anything, ha! You talking of raping her? Do it ! Can I take him to mental hospital? What do you think? I'm a mental case? How do you know what I think? So you thought I'm a mental Yes,come in! Hi! Thank you How is it that you're coming in the moment when Ram is going out? It's like that only Oh! Rosy! I want to bring this drama to an end What drama? Ram's drama! Okay.. bring it to an end You mean? Tell me! Rosy, do you know why I'm making frequent visits to your house? Tell me! Because Ram himself asked me to come here regularly I knew it! He is suspicious about you I knew that as well He wanted me to move more closer to you Yes, I know He wanted to know whether you are an adulteress. If not, he wanted me to make you one I know What? You know everything? Yes I know everything How did you know? Ram has told me too What did he say? That you are not a good man Then? He asked me to move close to you whenever you come Then? He said, however Anup tries he'll never do anything big You move him with closely and tell me all about him Scoundrel! I didn't understand when you started moving closely with me You didn't understand what? I thought you are a womaniser like Ram said, but I realised that you are just an arrow from Ram's bow How did you know about me? All your movements and actions were genuine But you never had the motive to have me Only then I knew, that you are a good man, that day when I hugged you I also saw him taking the coat and going out I knew you are acting as he said I never expected this What? That he would have spoken ill about me I don't understand why he is playing with the two of us I'm sorry You didn't do anything wrong He thinks I'm a womaniser. He also knew- well, you have lot of boy friends So what? I'm the only friend who visits him regularly He wants either me or you to do something wrong That's why he has spoken with us separately Oh! I see But let's not come to an end You know why? Why? Because I reported to Ram that you are a good girl. But till date you haven't told him that I'm a bad man. Yes. So I haven't told him that you are trying on me Absolutely correct Because of it, he suspects that you are getting weaker That's why he is sending me again and again Oh! It is better that if you tell him that I'm a scoundrel and a bad man Then he will believe But you are not bad Even then you didn't make any attempts to have me You are so brilliant! I like people who are normal Ram told me that you are impotent But you are a f**king stallion! He totally misunderstood me To misunderstand is in his genes Sometime back we went to a prostitute house Oh! Thats where he made the mistake When I was in the prostitute house My friend's shop was hit by a riot so I moved out of the place without doing anything But Ram thought I'm incapable Poor Ram misbehaved and teased me that I'm impotent I see Alright, you know what you should do? Tell Ram that I'm really bad and I tried to rape you Only then we can continue our affair without any problem I'll think about it Don't think, tell him that I'm bad Yes Bye Bye Yes Anu! Hey Ram! Like you said I tried to have a rough shot ride over Rosy Tell me what happened? She slapped and kicked me Good! I can't come to your house anymore Don't worry, I'll talk to her and set it right At last, you made her slap and boot me out! Sorry, but thanks anyway Bye Hi darling! Ram! No more friendship with Anup! Finish it! What are you talking? He behaved like a ruffian and a loafer I told you he is a bad man, just leave it Don't worry I'll call you back Bye! Hi Rosy! Anu darling! I told my husband exactly like you said, that you're a very bad man Thank you darling, we will meet afterwards But I have a doubt... But I have a doubt... You also started doubting? You also started doubting? No, it's not a doubt like Ram's It's different What? You look like a strong bull, but Ram thinks you're impotent It's like that! Your friend has already paid for your F**k This is for you Tips? Yes But, just come out and tell him that I'm impotent I can't understand Just tell him that I can't do sex properly.Okay? Why? Because this is my drama Mm. Okay. Please take it,Doctor I won't go against my profession Keep this 400 pounds,Doctor And now, tell me what I should say? Please say that I'm impotent, can not have sex and give a bad report on my sexual health Why? Please do me a favour I'll bring my friend, just tell him that I'm not good for sex I'm asking- Why? Because it is my drama Okay, bring him I love you darling! Let me speak! Your love, it was gone the moment you suspected that another man might have loved me You are a cunning fox! He is a genuine person Did he molest me? No. He was too noble a person for that! Now, Iâ€™m in love with him I feel sorry I wonâ€™t return his love He is better than you in all manner It's perfect. I'm sorry, I can't live and play two roles Neither can I ride two horses It's okay I'll call you on Monday Hope it's okay. Subtitled by Uma Kanagaraj Aura Subtitles & Content Creators
