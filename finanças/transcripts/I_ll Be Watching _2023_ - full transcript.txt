- No. - Can I get you anything else? - I'm fine. - Boop. - Oh, my god! Oh, thank God you came! - Oh, my god, are you kidding me? I wouldn't miss this for the world! - Ugh. - It's your big day! Oh, my gosh, look at how many people are here. - I know, it's really weird. - Let's take an SC. - Okay. - Okay. Looks really good. Where's Marcus? - He should be here any minute- Oh. This is him. - I'll hold one second. - Hey, babe. Are you on your way? - I'm so, so sorry. I just landed in New York. We had an emergency on board and got delayed. I... It looks like I won't be there in time. Babe? - Yeah, I'm here. It's fine. Really. - I'm sorry. I'll keep you posted. - I'll see you at home. - Okay. Bye. - Let's toast. - Let's. - To my amazing sister. - Mm. - A once art history teacher. Now, world famous painter. - Cheers. - Whoa. What is it? What's the matter? - Marcus isn't coming. - What? - I don't know. He said that he's still at the airport and he's never gonna make it on time. - And he's only just now telling you this? - This is your day! - Rebecca, stop. I don't wanna get more upset than I already am. It's fine. - No, it isn't. - I'm really tired. You know, I've been slaving away for this, away from you, away from my husband, away from everyone. And I've been here all fucking day. I don't know anyone here. And I just... What? - Oh, my god. Oh, my god. - What? - I forgot Pepper's medication. - Honey, Pepper will be fine. - No, no, no, no, no. The vet said I have to give it to him. I... You know what, I'm gonna go home. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - I'm gonna go. - No, you're not going anywhere. Don't be ridiculous. Look, I'll go home. I'll give Pepper his medication. - No, I'm not gonna make you do that. - What? No, it's fine. I'll be right back and we will celebrate you. Properly, okay? - Julie. - Hi. - Hey. I would like to introduce you to those people over there. They love your art. - Oh. - And they're so excited to meet you. And most importantly, they're ready to write you a check. - Um, uh, okay. I'll be one second. Just one. - Okay, okay, you stay, you mingle, and you get the monies. And I'll be right back, all right? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Mwah. - All right, security code. Same? - Still the same, yeah, yeah. - Mwah. See you later. - Okay. Let's make some money. Hi. - Hi, how are you? - Hey. - Pepper, you little shit. You scared me. Yes, you did. Oh, you're so cute. Get off of me! Get off me! - 911. What's your emergency? Hello? 911. What's your emergency? Hello? - How is it healing? - Uh, it's okay. Pain meds help. - Another reason why not to mix pills and alcohol. - I didn't trip because I was high, I tripped because of your stupid robot vacuum cleaner. - Look, I'm worried. She's mixing pills and alcohol again. - I have a lot of anxiety and I'm not sleeping. - Julie, we've talked about this. I know you need to take some pills for your pain and for your anxiety, but until you heal, it would be best if you didn't drink any alcohol. It really is dangerous. - The break-in, it was a tragedy. And Rebecca, she didn't deserve to die that way, but it has been five months and I would like my wife back, you know? She needs to... We need to move on. - Should have been me that night. - I understand. You feel your guilt. And it is a natural reaction to the situation. Grief is a process layered with emotions, and in order to get through it, you have to accept and deal with those emotions. It is going to take some time. You will get there. - Yeah, no, I understand that. You know, it was really hard being in our place after what happened, so I got us a new place, somewhere nice and quiet where Julie can paint and, you know, I can work from there- - And I said that I don't feel comfortable moving right now. - Well, um, relocating to a new house could help with the healing process. A new environment could give you a new perspective and help you separate the traumatic event that happened to your sister from the actual loss of your sister. - I don't like the idea of being out in the middle of nowhere. Alone. - Yeah, but you won't be alone. You know, I can work from home. I can be there to get you anything that you need. You know, I can finish working on Hera and maybe you'll get inspired to paint and... - Hera, that's his little toy that plays music and turns on the lights when you ask it to, but when you actually need it, it's useless. - Okay, first off, it's not a toy. And secondly, the version that we had was my first prototype, okay? We don't know what went wrong, exactly. Okay, you have no idea what this new upgrade is capable of. She can change our lives. - He's making a big effort here. Can you just meet him halfway? Hmm? - I think this could be really good for us. - And I will be there to help you, both, through this transition. - Hey. Julie. - How you liking the new place so far? - It's nice. - You know, there's still a few things to unpack, but I figure we can take our time with that. I'm glad we're doing this. - Me too. - You won't have to lift a finger, I promise. - Okay. Oh, god, there's so many boxes. Can't wait until we get unpacked. - Yeah, we'll get there. Oh, you're gonna love the new Hera. - Mm-hmm. - Who's that? - It's Sophie. Um, I'm gonna go upstairs, but you let me know when you're ready? - Mm-hmm, yeah. - Okay. Hi. - Hey, how's it going? I have been dying over here for details. You left so mysteriously. - I know. It's good, it's good. I mean, the house is really nice. I just can't wait until we're unpacked though because there's shit everywhere. - So you decided which room you're gonna have sex in first? Sophie, come on. - You guys still aren't getting along? Hey, you know, the best solution to, mm, everything is a good orgasm. - Really? - Yes, really. How the hell do you think I've been married so long? - I don't know, Soph, I just... I feel so... Hey, you are not alone. I am here for you. Just make the most of your time together. - Okay. I will. Thanks, Soph. Bye. - Bye. - Okay. Working. Hey, Jules, come downstairs. I wanna show you something. - Okay. - Um, let me see your phone? - Okay. - Yeah. I just wanna make sure that you are connected to everything. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Okay. This is Hera. She controls all the apps and the alarm system. Now, when you leave the house, it'll turn on. - Okay. - And, you know, if you're home alone, you can leave it on. But if a window or a door opens, the alarm will go off. And if you don't turn it off within five minutes, Hera will get the cops to come and check on you. - Okay, that's good. - Good, good, now, you can lock and unlock the doors from your phone or, you know, the tablet, the wall panels. - Mm-hmm. - Now, this app, this app starts the car from a distance. - Why would I need that? - Oh, I don't know. You might wanna put the AC on before getting in, for instance? - Right. - Right, okay, well, this app, this app starts the washing machine. - Okay, because pushing a button on a washing machine is so hard? - Jules, don't fight technology. Now, on this, and your phone, you can check all the cameras that are in the house. So there and there, and outside the house too. - Okay. Who else can see this? - Um, it's only you and me. - Oh, what about my sessions with Dr. Tate? They're private. - Yeah, uh, just tell Hera to turn the sound and the microphone off in the room that you're doing the session with Dr. Tate in. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay. Hello, Hera. - Hello, Marcus. It is nice to finally be back. - Hey, Hera, you remember my wife Julie, don't you? - I do. Hello, Julie. - Well? - "Well," what? - Say hello to Hera. - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious. - Hello, Hera. - Hera, it's a bit stuffy in here. Can you adjust the AC? - Of course. - Mm. Thank you, darling. It's so good to have you back. - My pleasure, Marcus. - Should I be jealous? - Oh, super jealous. Hera can control all of this stuff. She can hear you through the speakers and the cameras throughout the house. Um, phone. - Oh. - Yeah. Okay, I'm just gonna make sure that you're connected to everything and then I'll run it through with you later, okay? - Okay. I forgot milk. I'm gonna have to go to the store and get some. - Hera, order milk. - Ordering milk, Marcus. - That is ridiculous to just have her order one thing. - Then make a list. - Really? - Mm. - Julie, I have monitored the items in the refrigerator and have already placed a full order. - Oh. Thank you. Thanks, Hera. - Hey. - Hi. - I thought we... - You thought what? - I thought we weren't gonna mix pills with wine anymore. - You know what, I don't need to be lectured. I don't need you or anyone else telling me how to grieve or heal- - Okay, but we agreed with Dr. Tate- - You know what, just drop it. - Jules. - Drop it. - Do you think what happened to your sister was my fault? - I didn't say that. - You didn't have to. - Shit. - Look, I'm sorry, okay? I've been busy. Yeah. Yeah, I think that we have worked out all the issues. Yeah. No thanks. Right. Yeah. No, I got that. Thank you. No, she won't be a problem. - Who is that? - The investors on the project, they wanna meet me in person. - Oh, my god. Congratulations. Um, look, I- - Yeah, in Hong Kong though. - What? - Look, it's just gonna be a few days. - We just moved in. - Well, I'll be in constant contact, okay? - No. Marcus, I don't wanna be here alone. We talked about this. Not after what happened. - Hey, Julie, you'll be fine, okay? This is a top-notch security system, and besides, look where we are. What do you think can happen? Okay, the biggest crime that happens here is probably speeding on those empty streets or cow tipping or fraud. Look, you'll be fine. But I gotta go. Morning. - Morning. - Hey, I gotta get some items for travel. You gonna be okay? - Don't worry about me. - Hera, play soft music. - Good morning, Marcus. Soft music on its way. Hey, I got a conference call in 10 minutes. - Marcus, I... No. - Uh, hey, you get some rest. I'm gonna head into town after my call, so let me know if you need anything. - I'm here to assist you, Julie. - Shut the fuck up, Hera. Dammit. Sergeant Pepper! Shit. Hera! Uh... Pepper! Hi. - Hey, how's it going? - Oh, it's going. - What are you doing? - I am trying to do laundry. - Fun. How's Marcus? - He's Marcus. He's happy we're here. - And you? - I don't know yet. I mean, it's beautiful. But I tried to paint yesterday and I just ended up staring at the canvas for, like, an hour before I gave up. - Hey, you'll get your inspiration back. - Julie, please let me help you. Stand clear of the door. - Oh. Huh. Thank you. - My pleasure, Julie. - Who are you talking to? - Oh, nobody. It's Marcus's upgraded toy or, as he likes to call it, his virtual assistant. - Hey, shoot. I gotta go. The kids are getting into some trouble, but promise you'll call me every day. - I promise. - Okay. I will talk to you tomorrow. - I love you. Bye. - She seems fine to me. - You leaving after just getting there isn't going to be easy on her. - She will be fine, okay? I think we've made some progress. - Marcus, I don't think this is a good idea. Can't you postpone this? - Uh, Doc, can we postpone my payments to you? You know what, why don't we just postpone all my fucking expenses until we figure this thing out? Look, it's only five days. What about what I need? I will make it up to her when I get back. You know what, I think our session's up. Thank you for your time, Doctor. But I need to pack for my flight. - Marcus. - Fuck! I'm home! - In the kitchen. - That smells delicious. - It'll be ready in 10. - So how's the rest of your morning? Do anything interesting? - Not really. Still getting used to this house. - Mm-hmm. - How was your meeting? - Uh, yeah, I mean, they loved my presentation and the main investor is excited to meet me when I get to Hong Kong. - How long are you going for again? - Five days. So no wild parties. Not until I get back. - Can you grab my pain pills outta my purse? My ankle's killing me today. - How many have you had today? - This is my second. - Oh, how about just half? - Sure. - Hey, uh, you didn't move any crypto coins from our wallet account, did you? - No. Why? - Well, 20K crypto coins missing. - Well, I wouldn't even know what to do with crypto coin. I mean, did you call a bank or wherever you keep it? - Yeah, I'll look into it. Okay, well, I'll call you when I get there. - Okay. Well, I'll have a safe trip. - Marcus, it's time to go. - My driver's here. - I'll miss you. - Well, don't worry because I'll be watching. - Creep. - Bye, Hera. - Have fun, Marcus. - Love you, babe. - Love you. - Sweet dreams, babe. - Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Well, hello. Pepper, which one of these dresses should I keep? Hmm? I don't need both. This one? This one? Okay. Okay. I'm just gonna get a second opinion. Hey, I have a dilemma. - Well, you know you make your best decisions after a shot of whiskey. - Well, I was hoping you could help me. - Oh, sure. Yeah, I'm better than booze. Hey, guys, keep it down! I'm on the phone! - I need you to tell me which one of these I should keep. - Uh, none? - What do you mean none? I like them. - Where are you gonna wear them to? The annual harvest moon forest gathering or... - Okay, it's a little isolated, but it's not Siberia for God's sake. - Okay. I'm sorry. - I mean, the nearest little town's 10 miles and the city's 30. It's not so bad. Although there's no Lyft. - What? Okay, but Uber? - Mm-mm. - So where's Marcus? Is he playing with his little toys? - Uh, he just left for Hong Kong. - What? - Yeah, he had to go. Some deal they're closing. - Okay, well, I'm just really surprised he left you so soon. - Yeah, I'm kinda pissed off. We were actually getting closer, I think. - Mm, but it's not very sensitive if you ask me. Hey, come and stay with us for a few days, just until he gets back. - I don't know. - Come on. It'll be fun. I miss my roomie. - Really? Yeah, you know what, why not? Can I bring Pepper? - Yeah, you better bring that handsome boy. - Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow! - Okay. Mm. Hey, babe. I was just about to tell you my plans. - Yeah, what's going on? You're packing a bag? - Yeah. Um, I'm gonna go and stay with Sophie and the kids until you get back. - Look, Jules, I don't feel comfortable with you driving six and a half hours with a broken ankle whilst you're on meds. I just don't think it's safe. - So you can have a change of plans, but I can't? I don't wanna be here, Marcus. I'm alone and it's quiet. I don't like it. - Yeah, but Dr. Tate says that you need quiet right now. - Okay, can you please stop doing that? I feel like everyone is telling me what to do. - Okay. Okay, I'm sorry. You know I love you, right? - Yeah, I love you too. - And I miss you already. - Where are you now? - Oh, I'm just in my hotel room. What did you do today? - Not much. I got to relax and, um, I tried to paint. - That's good. That makes me happy. Okay, well, I've got a meeting in 10 minutes. I just wanted to call and say hi. - Good luck. - Thanks. Talk tomorrow? - Mm-hmm. I love you, Julie. - Goodnight. And stop talking to me through the cameras, please. - Julie. Julie. - Hi. Marcus? - Hey. Hey, what are you doing up in the middle of the night? I was taking a nap and Hera woke me up. - I heard a man's voice. - What? Who? - I don't know, I just... I know that I heard someone. I thought there was someone in the house. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? What happened? What? - Well, I heard him saying my name and then there was, like, footsteps and glass breaking. - Julie, you know that's not possible. - Well, I know what I heard, Marcus. - Babe, it's just another one of your bad dreams, okay? - No. No, no, I was awake. I was, and when I heard the glass break in the kitchen, I came out and there was nothing. - Listen, you're stressed, okay? Because you're home alone in the move and- - No. No, Marcus I heard a voice. Why don't you believe me? - Julie, I can see all the camera footage inside the house and it's just you there. So why don't you take a pill and try to relax and go back to sleep? And meanwhile I'll run a security system's check and make sure everything's running fine. You know, maybe, maybe there was some interference or something. - Okay. I miss you. - Hera, run a full diagnostics on the security system inside the house. - I'm running a full diagnostics now, Marcus. - Sorry for the bother, Hera. - No problem, Julie. - See? Get some rest. Goodnight. - Okay, goodnight. Pepper? Pepper. Are you in the laundry? What are you doing in there, silly? Hey, come here. Let's go back to bed, huh? What the... Oh, Jesus Christ. Hera, turn off alarm. Hera, turn off alarm! Okay. Hello. Hi. Yeah, I think my thermostat's broken. Actually, I know it is. No, it's brand new. We just moved in. It's Julie Alexander. Today? Yeah. Hey, Soph. I'm so sorry. - Hey, what's wrong? I thought you were coming over? - Yeah, I know. I didn't feel comfortable driving. My ankle's hurting and I'm still having nightmares. It might be the pills, but... - What? - I thought I heard a man's voice last night. - Probably just a nightmare. - Maybe. I don't know anymore. - Well, are you sure your alarm system's working? - Yeah, Marcus checked it. - Okay, well get some rest and call me if you need anything. - Hey. Are you hungry? Come on. Yeah, there you go. Ugh. Hera. - I'm the technician! - I know! Just one sec! Ugh. Sorry. - You called for the thermostat? - I did. Thank you for coming so soon. - No problem. - Come in. - I need access to the main unit. - It's in the laundry. I'll- - I know. - You know? - Yeah, I wired this place. I knew the old owner. - Oh. That's nice. Um, did he move away or... - Nobody knows. One day, he just disappeared. - It was really hot this morning. Now it's freezing. I don't know what's going on. Bless you. - Thank you. Do you have a cat? - Yeah, I do. He's probably in here. He loves sleeping in the washer. Hello. I'm allergic. - Oh. - Sleeping in there's dangerous, kitty. Looks like this little thing here got burned out. We need to change it. - Okay. How long is that gonna take? - I don't have a new one with me. I can come back tomorrow. - Sure. Okay, but the burglar alarm, that works, right? - Yeah. This is for the HVAC unit. Um, can I have a glass of water? - Sure. Right this way. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'll show you out. Hey, Dr. Tate. - Hey, Julie. How are you? - Um, oh, wait. Hera, turn off the sound in this room. Hera? - Turning off sound now. - Is that your husband's virtual assistant program? - Yeah. - How do you like it? - It's fine. - So have you been since Marcus left? - Not great. Uh, I don't like being alone, I'm not sleeping, and I thought I heard voices last night. - What do you mean you heard voices? - I don't know, I thought I heard glass breaking and someone calling my name. I don't know, it scared me half to death. - Could it have been a bad dream? - It could have. I'm not sure. - Hmm, had you taken your medication or did you have any alcohol? - No, last night, I just... I took my pain meds and a sleeping pill. - Oh, well, sometimes, combination of poor sleep and the stress of being alone combined with mixed medication can cause our minds to play tricks on us. - But it felt so real. - What else can you tell me about last night? - Well, look, it's been... - There's this old saying, "Art isn't finished- - Only abandoned. - I'm glad you've heard it too. Same goes with therapy. Don't give up. - Hi, Julie. How's it going? - You're up early. What time is it there? - There where? I'm here. - Okay. Stop messing around, okay, Marcus? Please. - You don't like to play? - It's not funny. You know I hate talking to you through the cameras. Can you please just call me like a normal person? - Wanna play hide and seek? Come on, let's play. - You've reached Marcus. Please leave a message. - What? - You've reached Marcus. Please leave a message. - He's probably asleep or too busy for you. - Who the hell are you? Hera, what's happening? - I am not sure I know what you are talking about, Julie. - I can't believe he left you all alone, knowing how you hate it. It's your fault your sister is dead. - Stop it. Where are you? - I told you, I'm here, Julie. I'm calling the cops. - Good evening. Red Dragon Restaurant. - What? - You wanna make reservation? - What? - I love Chinese food. - Where are you? Okay. All right, here we go. Come on. No. No, no, no, no! Shit. Okay. Um, uh... Jesus. - Are you Julia Alexander? - Yes. - Sheriff Anderson. Someone named Hera called 911 about an emergency? - Um, yes. Yes. Um, I think there's somebody in my house. - What happened? I don't know. I was sitting in my front room and I heard a voice. A man's voice. - Did you see anybody? - No, I didn't. I, um, I thought it was my husband messing around, but it wasn't. And, um, I- - I'll go check it out. You stay here. - Okay. Thank you. I'll turn off the alarm. So? - There's nobody, ma'am, except for your cat. Almost gave me a heart attack. - No, that's impossible. I heard him. And, I mean, the lights. Can we please just... Please have another look. - Sure. - Thank you. I swear, I heard him loud and clear. - Well, you know, these devices, they can get crossed up with radio signals. Might have just been a bored kid. We got plenty of those around, trust me. You wouldn't be the first one to be pranked. - But he knew my name. - You're new here. And people around here, everybody knows everybody else's business. There's just not much else to do. I'm telling you, kids with not enough distractions can get pretty creative. - Wait, he sent me texts. Here. See? - All right. What am I looking at? - The messages. He sent me these... What? They were here. I... - You know, maybe you should try to get some rest. Might have just had a little too much to drink. - Well... - I mean, we've been through the whole house twice. Nobody. I don't know about the text messages. Listen, be sure to turn on the alarm, huh? We don't have any serious trouble around here, but better be safe than sorry. - Okay. Oh. It's my husband. - You have a good night. - Thank you. Where were you? - Yeah, sorry, I was in a meeting. What's going on? - Someone was in the house. - What? Who? - I heard him. - Wait, where? Wait. Hold on. - I heard a voice, a male voice through the cameras. - I'm pulling up the cameras. - I thought it was just you messing around, but then when you didn't pick up- - Well, I can see that the police were there. What did they say? - Yeah, Hera called him, but he couldn't find anybody. - Well, I don't see anything on the footage. - Where are you? - I only hear you screaming. - Well, Hera will tell you. Hera, you heard it, right? You heard him? - I'm afraid Not, Julie. My system experienced a brief interruption, but I alerted 911 just to be safe. - Marcus, you swear you don't hear anybody? - No. I swear I didn't hear anything. - Wait, could that technician have messed with the system somehow? - But why would he do that? I mean, I didn't even know if he knows how to do that. He's an HVAC technician. - I just... I don't understand. Well, the cop said that it could have been kids in the area playing with radio equipment. - Okay, well, yeah, we can look into that, but I don't see how that could happen, if it happened. - You don't believe me. - Julie, Julie, I think that you experienced something and Hera even said that there was some interference, so we'll figure it out. But you're safe, I promise. How about you take a pill and you try to relax? You can call me if you need anything. I'll make sure my phone's on, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - I will. - Bye. - Bye. - Pepper. Sergeant Pepper? Hi. - Ooh! Are you trying to seduce me? - No, I'm trying to relax. - Aww, why so tense? - Either I'm going crazy or people around here have a sick sense of humor. - What happened? - Someone hacked into the security system and spoke to me through the cameras. - What the hell? Are you serious? - Yeah, a man or a man's voice spoke to me, asked me if I wanted to play hide and seek. - Did you call the police? - Yeah, but they couldn't find anything. I mean, there's no sign of a break in and the security system was on. - Yeah, but still, you're there alone. - You know, thinking that it was some sick teenager actually made me feel better. You know, I can deal with that. - Oh, my god. - What? What is it? What is it? - Ugh. - Julie, there's smoke in the kitchen. - I left the stove on. I gotta go. - Okay, bye. - Oh, god. Hera, turn off smoke alarm! And house alarm! - The alarms are off. - I am relaxed. I'm relaxed! Hera, lock door. Okay. - The number you have dialed has been disconnected. - What? Who are you? What do you want from me? I'm not afraid of a pathetic loser who's too afraid to show his face! What? What? What? Okay. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No. No! Oh, my god. No! Oh, Pepper. No. Oh, my, oh, my god. - 911. What's your emergency? - He's here! - Calm down, ma'am. Who's there? - The person that's inside my house! - Mrs. Alexander, why do you think there's someone there? - Why? Because he killed my cat! - Have you checked doors and windows? - Yes, I checked. - And they were locked, correct? - Can you please just send the sheriff? - Have you tried to relax? - What? - Have you tried to relax? - Do you think this is a joke? - No, Julie, I believe you. I don't know if Marcus will though. - Come on out, asshole. I have got nothing left to lose. - Whoa! - How did you get in here? - The door was open. Can you put that down, please? - No, it wasn't. - I rang the doorbell. I heard music. The door was open. - What are you doing here? - I brought the piece. I told you I would come back. I thought you needed that fixed as soon as possible. I live three miles up the road, I was on my way home- - Get out. Get out! - Okay, fine. I'm leaving. Shouldn't leave your door open. - I told you, I didn't! - You're alone in the middle of nowhere. You never know what's gonna happen. - Leave! - Goodnight. - Hey, what happened now? - Can you turn on video, please? - Julie, I'm in a meeting and I need to get back in there. - I need to talk to you. - Hang on. I'm here. What? - Pepper's dead. - What? - He killed him. - Who? Who killed him? - The person who broke in! - How could that happen? - I don't, I don't know. He was in the washing machine and he was spinning so fast. - Julie, okay, are you certain that you didn't turn the washing machine on? - I would never hurt Pepper. - No, I know that, babe. But maybe you pushed something on your phone and you turned it on. - What? You think I killed him? - No. No, it was an accident. - I don't, I don't remember turning it on. I don't remember closing the door. I don't remember. - Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay. - It's not okay. - Okay, maybe it was a malfunction, all right? I need to get back into this meeting, but try and go back to sleep and we can figure this out tomorrow, okay? Please. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Talk soon. Bye. - I'm so sorry, baby. I love you. - Who died? - Oh, god. You scared me. - Sorry, ma'am. I wanted to introduce myself. I'm Gerald, but everyone calls me mailman, maybe because I deliver the mail. - Oh, I'm Julie. - These are yours. Bills, I think. - Thanks. - Did you like the gift? - What did you just say? - The package I delivered. - There was no sender. Do do you know who sent it? - No, ma'am. - Okay. Well, thank you. - Be careful of too much time home alone. - What do you mean by that? - Bye, miss. Julie. See you soon. - Motherfucker! Come on, Marcus. - We're sorry, the person you have dialed is not available. He's too busy with another woman. Do you want to leave a message? - What? No. - You don't believe me? - What is going on? Fuck you! New York? Hera, turn off sound in this room. - The sound has been disabled. - Marcus is cheating on me. - I'm sorry, Julie. - Hera, please call Premium Blossoms New York. - Sure. I'm calling Premium Blossoms in New York. - Ask them to whom they sent the flowers. - Premium Blossoms. How may I help you? - Hello, my name is Amanda. I'm calling to verify an order for delivery on May 11th for my boss Marcus Alexander. I want to make sure the flowers went to the right address. Could you check, please? - Yeah. One moment. - Thank you. - 946 Bleecker, signed by Michelle Donovan. Is there a problem? - All is in order. Thank you so much for your help. - Hera, I need Marcus's email password. - I'm not allowed to provide such information. I'm sorry, Julie. - Shit. How are you doing? - We made a deal. I'll be home soon. - Congratulations. - What's wrong? Julie, I know you well. Something's obviously wrong. - How long have you been fucking Michelle Donovan? - What? - Yeah, whoever broke into your perfect security system also wanted to share some info about you and your little secret. Isn't that funny? - Julie! - Hera, play music. - Please! Come on! Just pick up the phone. Let's talk on the phone. Julie. - Hera, raise the volume. - Julie, please! Julie, please. Come on. Shit! Goddammit. - What's going on? - My wife, she knows. - I thought you said she thinks you're in Hong Kong. - Fuck. Julie, pick up. Can we please talk about this? - Fuck you! - It's not what you think. Okay, just let me explain! Julie, just stop and listen to me, okay? She meant nothing to me. She meant nothing to me, okay, Julie? I'm worried about- - Hera, block Marcus. - Please, Julie, just please- - Marcus has been blocked. - Hey! Oh, what's wrong? You look awful. What's going on? - Uh, Marcus is cheating on me. - What? - Someone, some unknown number, sent me photos of him kissing another woman. - What a fucking bastard. - I feel like such an idiot. - No, babe. He is a huge asshole. You are not an idiot, at all. When is he coming back? - I don't know. Soon, I think. - You should leave before he gets back. You can come stay here. Julie, you need to get the hell outta there. - I can't leave. The car won't start and I'm just so tired. I haven't slept properly in days. And, um, Pepper's dead. - What? I'm so sorry, hon. What happened? - I don't know anymore. - Okay, well, I'm gonna come and get you. - No, no, that's okay. I'll be fine. - Julie, I will come and get you tomorrow. I don't even have the kids tomorrow. - Okay. Thank you. Hera, turn off sound. - Done. - You wanna know the problem with people, Hera? They'll lie, they'll cheat, and they'll ruin your fucking life. Nobody knows how I feel. Nobody. You know, my sister was the best thing about my life. We were one soul. I'd do anything to get her back. - I'm very sorry for your sister. Rebecca was an accident. - I bet you Marcus is trying to drive me crazy. But why? You know what, I bet you Michelle's in on it too. It's so they can live happily ever after. Don't even recognize him anymore. What has she done to him? - Do you need me to call Dr. Tate, Julie? - Mm-mm. No. No. I bet you he's in on it too. He's drugging me to make me look crazy, to make me feel crazy. - Marcus definitely asked Dr. Tate to give you more medication in one of his emails. - I gotta get out of here. Hera, turn off the light in the kitchen. - Sure. - Hera, call 911. Hera. Hera, open the door. What? Hera, call 911. Hera, open the fucking door. Hera, help me. - Yes, Julie, how can I help you? I'm back online. - No. Hera, be quiet. There's an intruder in the house. I need you to call the police. - Police expected time of arrival is 42 minutes. - What? Hera, open the backdoor. - The backdoor is now unlocked. - Julie. Julie? Julie. Julie, wake up. Wake up, please. Please. Hey, hey, hey. Julie. Julie, please. Please, please. Wake up, wake up. Wake up, Julie. - No, please. I won't tell anyone. - You killed her! Fucking bastard! Who are you? - You hired me for this job. I'm sorry I screwed up the first time. - Shut the fuck up! I don't know what you're talking about or who the fuck you are! - Check my phone! - What the fuck? - You'll go to jail too. Let me go. I won't tell anyone. I'll give you back the crypto coins. - You killed my wife. - Marcus, the police are on the way. - Julie. Julie. Julie. - You did great, Marcus. Don't worry, I'll wipe all the devices. His phone too. - What? - I'm sorry I had to get rid of Julie and Michelle. I know this is hard, but it was the only way we could be together. - The fuck is happening? - It's going to be okay. You have me, and I love you, Marcus. Just try to relax. I destroyed all digital evidence. You will be okay. And I love you, Marcus. Just try to relax.
