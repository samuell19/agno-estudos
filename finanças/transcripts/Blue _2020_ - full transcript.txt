(dramatic music) [Mom] Somto! (phone ringing) Hello. [Ikenna] Hello, Somto. Yeah, who's this? [Ikenna] My name is Ikenna. Uh-huh. [Ikenna] I got your number from your sister. You were at my office a few days ago with her. Please, do not call this number again. [Ikenna] I'd like us to meet. (gentle music) (man snoring) (gentle music) Hey, big head. Somto! Wake up. Wake up! Wake up. Leave me alone, I'm still asleep. Really? It's like 10:15 in the morning and you're still in bed. Wake up, (speaking in foreign language). Yeah, big head. See, I was thinking, you get up, you take a shower and we go out. I don't want to go anywhere. Well, I have tickets for the movies. Yeah. And I was thinking ice cream, chocolate, you know, your faves. Thank you. I like the sound of ice cream. You get up. So do you like it, or should I get something else? This? No, I don't want that one. Just get up. Get up. You're good? Why are you asking me if I'm good? I just wanna make sure. Is it because you bought ice cream for me? So you can now suddenly predict my mood? Somto, I'm not trying to... Nevermind. Sorry, I asked. (gentle music) I'm not sure how to say this, but I want you to know that I really care about you. I'm sure you know that. I really care about... And I just want you to be fine. So don't be angry with me. What's going on? I don't understand. I want you to see a doctor. I already booked an online session with you. Or rather, I already booked a session with you online. So, and I'm sure he will help you. Is this a joke? No, Somto, it's not like that. It's not like what? So you come to my room, you say you wanna take me out and now you're telling me I need to see a doctor? So you think I'm a sorry case? Somto, I am your sister. You know, you've actually never done this for me, taking me out. Somto, I am your sister and I love you very much. I care about you so much. I just want you to be okay. I just want you to be fine. Hang on, I'm not even going to have this conversation. If I didn't care, I wouldn't be this worried. I wouldn't be... I wouldn't even... Somto, where are you going? Somto, I'm really worried. Somto! [Receptionist] Okay, sir. You can go in. That's the door. [Somto] So you think I'm a sorry case? Hello! Hello! How did you see my performance tonight now? It was dope. You feel I'm (speaking in foreign language)? - It was dope, yeah? - Yeah, it was dope. Awesome. I mean, all the girls were just drooling all over you. - Really? - Uh-huh. - The girls? - Yeah. Which girls? I didn't see any girls though. The girls at the front row that were really drooling and looking and screaming. Did you see them? I really don't care. I just want them to love my music. I don't care about them loving me personally. - Yeah. - Yeah, right. - Yeah. - Oh! As long as say, the music they hit, and they give them shout, girl, we don't got a problem. By the way, I think you need to change your hype man. - Oh my God, I know. - He is so lame. The worst. I need to call that goat. I need to call him tonight and talk to him. I need to really talk to him. Yeah. I don't think you shouldn't use a muscle. It's all about you talking to him. Don't bother. I know, but... - When he makes you... (phone buzzing) Hey. What are you... Hey! Somto, what are you doing? Why is she calling you? That's rude. Why would you hang up my call? Why is she calling you? I don't know. Maybe to check up on the show- - To check up on what? - And see how the show went. Why at this time of the night? Do you know what time it is? Why is she calling you now? Why can't she wait till tomorrow? I mean, you guys will still see at the studio. Why does she have to call you now? That's no reason for you to hang up my call. It's my phone. - Really? - Yes. Is that why you're yelling at me? Because of your bitch, you're yelling at me now? Somto, I don't like this attitude. - Stop this nonsense now. - You know what? Just... Stop this nonsense. Just stop this car. We've been over this a long, since several times. - Stop this car right now. - I'm not stopping this car. I said, stop this car. I'm not stopping this car. I would... Okay, okay, okay. I said, stop it, now. Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me just park. What is wrong with you? And where do you want to get to by this time? - Look at the time. - I don't care. It's like past 2:00 a.m. I don't care. I just want to leave your presence. Like, I can't deal with you spouting about your bitch. Can we just talk about this? I don't wanna talk about anything. Can we just talk about this now? There's nothing going on between I and Desola. She's just my friend. We're just signed to the same record label. Somto! Somto! Somto! Somto! What is wrong with you? Are you serious? You're actually carrying me right now? Yes, I am. I'm carrying you. Leave me alone. Oh my God! Go inside. (gentle music) This how you just be causing trouble for me every time. Misbehaving, acting like a child. Good morning. Leave me alone. Come on, babe. We talked about this. I'm sorry, and I'm not leaving you alone. Babe, you have to trust me here. You have to be trustworthy. But I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm giving my best to you. You just have to chill. Take a chill pill and give me some... Give me a breather. All right, you know what? Let's go out tonight. Let me give you something special. Special treat. Both of us. Okay. Why, you can talk again, huh? Okay. You're so funny. I'm serious. I'm still mad at you. - The cat caught your tongue? - I'm still mad at you. - I'm not even joking. - You're still mad at me, huh? - You're still mad at me. - Yes. I don't know why you like to give me trouble. (laughing) Stop doing that. Stop, stop. I'm serious. I don't want to laugh. I'm still angry. Let's start going. I'm late to the studio. All right, of course. For the umpteenth time, there's nothing going on between I and Desola. We're signed to the same record label. She's actually an amazing person and a great song writer when you get to know her. Can we please not let this- - No! You cheeky monster. I don't know why your head's spinning so much. Leave me alone. I should leave you alone, huh? Yes. By the time I stuff you with food today, then you go know. I don't know why you like giving me stress. (gentle music) [Ikenna] Would you care for some water? Yes. Okay. There you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. If you need more, just let me know. So what changed your mind? Is that your wife? Yes. Yes, that's my wife. She's pretty. Thank you. Thank you. How long have you been married? We've been married for five years. You have kids? No. No. You seemed pretty adamant on resisting this. What changed? Where did you meet her? My wife? Uh-huh. We met in school. We were in the same department. Nice. So back to my question, what changed your mind? Well, everyone thinks I'm crazy. That's why I'm here. Do you agree with them? Is this is how it goes? You ask me questions and then- - Yes, yes. I ask you questions and from time to time, I jot down some things just to keep refreshing my memory. Oh, and feel free to interrupt at anytime to steer the conversation where you need it to go. Okay? All right. So back to my question, do you agree with that? Do I... Do you think I'm crazy? Do I look crazy? Well, do you think you act crazy? (ominous music) - Oh my God. (screaming) It's so good to see you. Let's take a selfie. [Woman] Okay. Please take us a picture. - Okay, that's fine. - Yeah. Oh my God, it's so good to see you. It's good to see you too. What's your name? - Sasha. - Sasha? (ominous music) Okay. One more. One more. Give me that. Somto! Are you crazy or something? Sorry, sorry, sorry. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. I'll pay for it. [Sasha] Oh my God, it's so good to see you. [Mike] Good to see you too. What's your name? [Sasha] Sasha! [Woman] One more. One more. [Sasha] Oh yeah. Okay. Can I... Can I? Oh, no! But you can step out if you need to. I mean, we have about 35 minutes left though. I see. So what is the problem from your own viewpoint? I mean, everybody thinks I'm crazy. (gentle music) Do you think I'm crazy? How does it make you feel when people think you're crazy? Happy, sad, angry, or what? It makes me even more mad, you know? Because there's no need trying to convince people that already think you're mad that you're not mad. So it just make me more mad. Okay, makes you mad. But do you think I'm crazy? Do I act like I'm crazy? Well, just me seeing, you know, still getting to know you. Whatever. What's your greatest achievement? I don't know. I'm sure you have something you're proud of. I don't think so. I mean, I haven't really done much with my life. Well, except for some stupid essay I wrote in secondary school. I was published in a newspaper and I was given some stupid award for it. That's all. Impressive. What was it about? It was nothing special. Do we really have to talk about it? Yes. Yes, please. Go ahead. Well... Okay, fine. It was about a girl who was locked up in a room. She struggled to come out of this room, but all to no avail. So eventually, she slept in the room and she had the most beautiful imagination ever. What does she imagine? She's laying on her back upon a cold marble floor. She imagines true happiness. What she would love her life to look like. (psychedelic music) Her mind drifts and wanders. And then her soul rises out of her body. Then her imagination turns into her reality. She's beneath the sea. The water is warm and it's clear. She can breathe. She feels no pain. She feels no sorrow. Her limbs are effortlessly floating, and she's gliding through the water as if she's flying through the air. And then suddenly, she jolts back to reality and it becomes dark again. Have you ever attempted suicide? Yes, I have. Was there any particular reason? Yeah, Mike left me. Who's Mike? Mike is my boyfriend. I mean my ex, because he dumped me. Sorry about that. No, it's fine. I killed him. (dramatic music) - You what? - Yes, I did. I killed him. I killed him in my head. Yeah, I literally burned him to death in my head. Yeah. I mean he tried to kill me, so I had to kill him first. He tried to kill you? Wow. Wow! Really? You know, I get that your life is all figured out. Your life is perfect. You have a beautiful wife. You have a great job. You have everything going on so well for you. Do you really think you can understand me? You just sit there and you act like you do but you can never understand me and my life and what I have been through, okay? Don't act like you do because you want to get paid. Don't do that. I'm not stupid. This is it. This is just a total waste of time. I'm done. I'm done with this. (gentle music) [Commentator] Bottom half of the 10th with nothing but goose eggs on the scoreboard. Two down, no one on and a count of three and two in the battery. Here comes the pitch... Hello, mom. My girl, how are you? Fine. How did it go? It was okay. Are you sure? Uh-huh. Are you hungry? I made some pepper soup. I'm not hungry. Life doesn't revolve around food. What did you just say? Nothing. You know, you're very rude. (speaking in foreign language) I think there's something wrong with Somto. (speaking in foreign language) Mommy, I think Somto is suffering from a mental illness. (speaking in foreign language) Mommy- (speaking in foreign language) Mommy, her behavior is not exactly normal. It's not. I believe we should also pay our own part. She needs to see a therapist. I've been looking- (speaking in foreign language) Therapist? (speaking in foreign language) Mommy, there are a lot of mental health counseling services in Nigeria right now. I mean, we should get her a therapist. He will access and know what's wrong with her and commence treatment immediately. (speaking in foreign language) Mommy, (speaking in foreign language). (speaking in foreign language) (gentle music) Super girl! (giggling) Okay, come, come. Let's go and take some drinks. Who wants a drink? - Fanta! - Fanta, let's go. - Yogurt. - Yogurt, okay, okay. Now, let's jump one last time. One, two, go. One, two, go. One, two, go. One... - Babe. - Yeah. Must you do this every time you come visiting? Oh, it's nothing. It's nothing. [Mrs. Ikenna] You look completely exhausted. I'm fine. Yes. I was expecting that. You know you don't have to come here every night. Well, how could I possibly go to bed without seeing my beautiful baby? You and your charms. (gentle music) How are you? I'm fine. I wanna take you home. I can't. Babe, you know I can't. I know. (somber music) Hey. You haven't left this room since yesterday. I thought I'd bring you breakfast. How's it going with Dr. Ikenna? I see you've been communicating with him. And you had to tell mommy, right? I had to tell her. I mean, she finally agreed to it. Whatever. (ominous music) [Mike] You know, you could have waited for them to leave before you disrespect me like that in public. For crying out loud, that girl was on your lap and kissing you. You know what, I don't wanna talk about this. I'm done with this. I've had a long day and I'm tired. Of course you did. Whatever. Whatever? Yes. Whatever, Somto. Whatever! - Really? - Yes. I guess my feelings don't count anymore. Only God knows what you do behind my back. I mean, you're so paranoid. You are so paranoid. Everything means something to you. It's like your brain just keeps working overtime. You connect every useless dots that your imaginary mind makes up. Wow. So I'm crazy? Yes, you are. But I'm the only one who gets to see the uncool side of you. When you're broke, I'm here. When you're lonely, I'm here. When you're sad, I am here. When you cannot even get the lyrics to your songs, I am here with you. You're just a bloody up and coming artist. I don't know why I have to even deal with you and your useless fans or whatever. Wow! I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. No, I know say I never blow now. I never blow. (speaking in foreign language) I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that, but it breaks my heart when I see you with those girls. I feel so disrespected. I mean, the way you flirt with them in front of me... I don't... All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay. It's okay. You won't leave me, right? Babe, you've been asking this question. What's up with that? Why do you keep asking that? Just promise me that you won't leave. Babe, I am not leaving you. I promise. I'm not going anywhere. All right? Look at me. (dramatic music) (mellow music) (mellow music) (people laughing) (indistinct chattering) Yo, yo, yo, people. We just made the sickest beats. - Yeah, man. - Sickest beats. All the way right here waving as you see my boys, man. See my boys in the hood. And my darling, Desola. Yeah, yo, I can't wait for what's coming. Something big is coming. (indistinct chattering) (upbeat music) ♪ To think that you later had a say ♪ ♪ You know you tried to fool me ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ Oh, I'm so sorry for interrupting your nookie. I'm just going to leave. No, no, it's not what you think. All right, it's not what you think. Don't you dare. Don't you dare! So you guys have been fucking all along, and you've been making me feel stupid for thinking that? What is wrong with you? How dare you! Must everything be about cheating and accusing me? Yes, because that is what you do. - What is wrong with you? - Fuck you! Must everything be about fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck? She's just my friend. - She's your friend? - Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. - Your friend? - Yeah. Okay. Bitch, where do you think you're going to? I will just scatter your face. - Are you mad? - Stop this rubbish. Stop this rubbish. Don't tell me to stop anything. - You can't come in here and- - You're fucking around and you're making me feel stupid. Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Leave me... Baby. Somebody has my... (crying) Fuck you! Fuck you! Somto. Are you... Let me see. Come down, now. Come down, now. Let me see. Leave me alone, I'm trying to hurry. Where is Somto? - It's here? - Yeah. (speaking in foreign language) Chibuzo! Chibuzo. Open this gate, now. Chibuzo. Mike! Just wait, just wait. Mike. I've been trying to get in and Chibuzo didn't let me in. I was even calling him and knocking on the gate. He didn't answer, and I called your name too. What's going on? It's over between us. I don't understand. We- I can't continue with this relationship, Somto. I can't. We had a fight. It wasn't serious. It's not just the fight. It's... Mike, I've been calling you. You won't even answer my calls. You don't answer my messages. Nothing. Somto, it's over. It's over between us. Mike, wait, wait. Let's talk. Mike! Why did you leave me? (sobbing) (screams) Somto! Somto! Somto, it's mommy. Somto. (dramatic music) (loud knocking) Somto, (speaking in foreign language). - Open the door. - No. Mommy, what's wrong with her again now? I heard her scream. You heard her too? Somto, since morning, she's been in here. Somto, open the door. Go and get the spare key. Somto! Can't somebody sleep in this house? Go, go, go. Go and get the spare key. Somto, (speaking in foreign language). (loud knocking) (groaning) (speaking in foreign language) Somto! There's another key behind. - Somto! - Somto! (Somto screams) Somto! So, you're passionate about writing? Yes, I love writing. When was the last time you wrote? I don't remember. Excuse me. Last week? Last month? How long ago? I said, I don't remember. You look tired, like you haven't gotten enough sleep. Yeah, I had a long night. What were you doing? Bonking your wife? That's inappropriate. Okay, we're here to talk about you, not me. My apologies. I mean, married people have sex. I don't know why you're so upset. I'm not Now, please, could you answer my question? So uptight. (gentle music) What was your question again? What's your greatest fear? I guess losing my sister and maybe my mom. Why did you hesitate before you mentioned your mother? I don't like her. Why? Somto, take a little now. (speaking in foreign language) Take a little. Why are you doing this now? Eat. All right, take. You should have let me die. God forbid! (speaking in foreign language) Let you, (speaking in foreign language). Stop saying things like that. Because of what? Why? I should've... Somto, this thing that you're doing is not good. It's not good. Hello. - Pastor. - Yeah. How is she? (speaking in foreign language) still here? We're still here. She wants to die. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. She cannot die. (speaking in foreign language) what is my own gain? What is my gain? Don't worry. Madam, all these things are just trying times. God may just be testing your faith. All you need to do is have faith. My faith is big like this. Big. Big (speaking in foreign language) like this. I know. Don't worry, she'll be fine. Let us pray. Eternal rock of ages, there is no one like you. She thinks I'm crazy. You know, she actually brought people to the house to whip me all day? All in the name of deliverance. She's very mediocre in her thinking and overly religious. (chanting in foreign language) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Receive it. Receive it, I've said, receive. (chanting in foreign language) I think she hates me. I don't feel safe in the house anymore because I feel like she can just strangle me in my sleep. What's going on here? You locked your key inside? Mommy has a spare just beside her bed in the drawer. Mommy wants to kill me. Madam, done be okay now. Okay. - I go see you later. - No problem. Mommy wants to kill me. What? Yes. I feel like she's going to hurt me. I don't feel safe anymore in this house. That's why I had to change my locks. Okay, this is absurd. Are you even listening to yourself? Look, I'm going to get a place very soon, but pending the time I get a place, I've decided to change my door locks. Please don't tell her. I beg you, don't tell her. Somto, now! So you don't believe me? I'm sorry about that. (gentle music) But why do you think she would kill you? You're her child, aren't you? Because she thinks I'm a disgrace to the family and I embarrass her. (speaking in foreign language) - Ma! - How are you? I'm fine, ma. (speaking in foreign language) I see marriage agrees with you. We thank God, ma. (speaking in foreign language) - Sweetheart. (dramatic music) Ever so beautiful. Come, come, come, come. See your cousin is looking so beautiful. (speaking in foreign language) See how marriage is agreeing with her. Are you okay? Why are you asking me if I'm okay? (speaking in foreign language) Do I look like something is wrong with me? (speaking in foreign language) Why is she asking me if I'm okay? (speaking in foreign language) Ifeoma. Yes. How are you? I'm fine. You look really nice. [Ifeoma] Thank you. [Somto] I can see marriage is really good on you. Yes, we thank God, oh. I see. But you know what? He's going to dump you very soon. (speaking in foreign language) And I'm sure he's cheating on you. He's sleeping with someone right under your nose. (speaking in foreign language) He'll dump you real soon. Very soon. (speaking in foreign language) Stop talking to your sister about me. (speaking in foreign language) Mommy, so you think I'm crazy? So that's why you go around telling your family members that your child is crazy? Somto, (speaking in foreign language). What are you doing to yourself? If you don't stop acting crazy, you'll end up like your father. End up like my father? Don't talk about daddy like that. Daddy was good to us. He loved and cared for us. I wish you'd died instead. - I see. - Don't say that. What? I see. Is there any reason why I shouldn't say it? Because it means you don't believe me. Oh, I'm sorry. I won't repeat it again. Whatever. Can I go now? Of course, of course. We'll see you next week? And I would love to read something from you. Take care. (soft knocking) - Hey, wife. - Hi, husband. - Here you go. - Another one. Yeah. Smells sweetly nice. Your favorite. Yes. Thanks, babe. You're welcome. So how do you feel? I'm good. Are you sure? I feel great, actually. How's work? Work. Work is hectic as usual. [Mrs. Ikenna] Ouch. Yeah. What case are you working on? Tell me about it. Well, I've got this patient right now. Her case is very disturbing. How so? I don't want to bother you with work. No! Actually, I want to hear about it. I miss sessions with patients. And besides, you know I'm an expert in this. You just want to show yourself shy. (laughs) Yeah, she's a hard nut to crack. But I'm thinking paranoid personality disorder or paranoid schizophrenia from the sessions we've had together so far. What are your findings? Well, she has distortions in her thought pattern and her major trigger is losing the people that matter to her the most. So she has abandonment issues? Yes. Definitely. And from your findings, you think it's paranoid schizophrenia? Or PPD. - Right. - Yeah. You know, she has this delusion of killing her boyfriend because he broke up with her. And she hates her mother. She believes her mother could strangle her in her sleep. Apparently, her mom took her to one of these churches where they whip you all in the name of deliverance. Why would her mom do that? I have no idea. African mom mentality, I guess. That's barbaric. Yeah. And about her boyfriend, it could be that she is still shellshocked and angry about the breakup. So I think you should do some more digging. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I've resolved to do. You look exhausted. - I'm fine, babe. - No, you're not. Come here. Bring your big head. My big baby. (Laughs) Yeah, I love being your big baby. Okay. Oh, you're soothing me. - I know. (both laughing) Hello, mom. - How are you? - Hi, Chika. (gentle music) (sobbing) (phone buzzing) You're sleeping with her, right? You're sleeping with her. You bloody cheat. You're a liar. Babe, what are you talking about? What is this about? Somto, what is this? You are sleeping with her. - Sleeping with who? - You're a bastard. What are you talking about? I'm lonely. I'm lonely. Are you up? Are you kidding me right now? I don't understand. What are you talking about? With who? Sleeping with who? Why is she sending you a text at this time of the night? It is midnight and she's sending you a text message. - Who? - Who else? Desola. I want an answer now. What do you have with her? You woke me up because of this? You're hitting me because of this? You call this, this? You call this, this? Mike, you call this, this? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? Get a grip on yourself. I am not cheating on you. You're not cheating on me. No, I'm not. Of course, you're not cheating on me. That's what you say all the time, but you're cheating. She's sending you a... She sends you a message So she sends me message, - In the middle of the night. - So what? You're telling me you're not cheating on me. She sends me a massage, so what? What does that have do with anything? - So what? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. For goodness sake, look at the time. You're just a bloody liar and cheat. Why you're just waking me up by this time because of this rubbish? Huh! You know what? I am done? I'm done. I can't do this anymore. What do you mean you can't do this anymore? I'm leaving. I can't do this anymore. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen to me. - Leave me alone. - Stop this. - Stop. - Leave me alone. Listen, I swear. I swear to you. I am not cheating on you. All right? And by the way it's like, what's the time? Like what? 2:00 a.m.? Where do you wanna go? All right, fine. I'll go. I'll stay in the living room and you can stay here if that's what's gonna bring peace and make you sleep well at night. (gentle music) Don't go. Please. Don't go. Please, don't leave me. We can't keep doing this. You just can't keep doing this to us, all right? There's always one problem or another with you. You can't. Promise me not to leave me. Promise. Not again. Not again. Not again. Not again. Damn! So what are you gonna do about this? What am I going to do? I mean, obviously you have to do something about this. I don't know. (somber music) (sobbing) ♪ Come on baby we're cooking up a storm ♪ ♪ Come on baby it's where we belong ♪ ♪ Can I see your mirrors in the sky ♪ - Hello. - Hey. How are you? I'm okay. No, no, no, don't turn it off. I like the song. Oh, okay. Yeah, I like it too. Who's the artist? It's Banky Boy. Oh, I've never heard of him. Yeah, he's new, but he's very good. Okay. So, are you working on anything? Anything like? Like a book? An article, maybe? Nothing really? I mean, I still have a lot of unfinished work. I see. You should try and finish them. I'll try. I'm working on them. I'll work on them. What about your dad? You never really talk about him. That's because he's dead. How old were you when he passed? I was 13, I think. What was he like? I don't remember. Why are you talking about my dad? Nothing, really. I'm just curious. Sorry if my questions bring back painful memories. Can we not talk about my father? Okay. Okay. (Ikenna sighs) My wife is dying. What? She's been sick for awhile now. I'm sorry, I had no idea. Uterine cancer. Stage three. - Wow. - Yeah. I'm so sorry. It must be very hard on her. On you both. Yeah, it's harder on her, you know? I wish we could swap places. But honestly, sometimes it all gets too much for me. The first two years was hell for both of us. She could barely sleep because she was in so much pain. I was sad, frustrated, angry. I just... I wanted to leave her, you know? (gentle music) And I think she knew and that just made her feel worse. She was physically emaciated. I mean, she could barely stand on her two feet. I dreaded going back home. I dreaded seeing her, like in that state. When your partner has terminal illness, there's no going back to how it used to be. It's only going forward, and it was hard for me to accept that. I guess when it said, "In sickness and in health," I was thinking maybe in our 80s, you know? Not in our 30s. I was wrong. I was so wrong for dreading to go back home, dreading to see her. I was blind to her beauty. But now, when I see her beautiful face, her beautiful smile, it just strengthens me. It's like magic. It truly is like magic. I mean, her jokes. She has jokes. The way she laughs, it just lights up my day. I'm just trying to make the most of the little time we have together. I don't even know why I'm telling you this. Sometimes in life, we find ourselves in a place where we feel so scared and confused. And the only thing we need to do to lift up that burden is to find someone who'll listen to us. You're using my words now? Yes, I am. How do you live knowing that she'll die soon? Life is so unfair. The way people just die and leave their loved ones behind. Really, the only thing to do is cherish the memories we have with them. It's not that simple. I miss him so much. How did he die? My mom was going to leave him. They had a fight about it. They argued, he begged her to stay but she was so adamant. She left with my sister and I that night. I cried. I cried so hard because I didn't want to leave him. Yeah. Then the next week we heard that he had a car accident. He drove into a trailer. I kind of blame my mom for his death. Did you ever ask your mom why she left your father? Yeah, I did. When I was much younger, I would ask her and she wouldn't say anything about it. She didn't want to talk about it. So I stopped. My dad was perfect. He was a perfect father. And she was a perfect husband to my mom. I always wanted to find him in every guy I meet. I wanted to see him in Mike but Mike wasn't cut out for that. I just wanted Mike to show me that love and attention that I used to see my father show my mom every day. So we would fight constantly about it, Mike and I. And then I got pregnant. He was so irritated. He asked me to get rid of the baby. So I had to struggle with... (sobbing) I had to struggle with getting rid of the baby, and at the same time fighting him. Our fights... It wasn't easy. He would constantly cheat on me until he finally left me. I felt so empty. I felt so useless. I still feel empty, like there's nothing left. I'm sorry about your dad. As for Mike, you can't can blame yourself for him cheating on you. We're responsible for our actions as adults. As adults, it's our responsibility to communicate when we're frustrated, when we're angry, when we're mistreated. Cheating is never the way out, you know? It just makes things worse. Listen, Somto, you can't change your past. You can only change your thought process, your future and the kind of people you attract to yourself. (gentle music) And your man can never, ever be your father. And you don't want your man to have an identity crisis 'cause he's trying to be who you want him to be just to please you. 'Cause a person's personality, gifts, interests make them who they are. Come in. - Babe. - Yeah. I made lunch. Can you keep the food for me in the microwave? Working on a script? Uh-huh. What? Nothing, carry on. Well, bye. Bye. (upbeat music) [Somto] This place is really nice. It's so relaxing. Yeah, I figured, a different location would be best for today. You thought well. I like it. What's on your mind? Nothing really. You know, when I was younger, I used to have these stick-on notes on my wall. They were the first thing I saw when I woke up in the morning. They were basically stick-on notes of positive quotes that helped me kickstart my day. (laughing) Lame. Maybe lame but it was really helpful. Like really, really helpful. From my experience, what you do early in the morning sets the tone for the rest of your day. So, what did this, your little stick-on notes say? Well, I'm happy to be alive. Tough times do not last, tough people do. Work hard and achieve, things like that. I will live my dreams rather than live in my past. That's a nice one. Yeah. (gentle music) Limitations live only in my mind, but if I use my imaginations, my possibilities will become limitless. I will love myself first and everything else falls into place. What lies behind me and what lies before me are tiny compared to what lies within me. I will not rely on someone else for my happiness and self-worth. Only me can be responsible for that. If I can't love and respect myself, no one else will be able to make that happen. I am the best version of myself. I am beautiful and wonderfully made. I'm positive in my thoughts and my actions. I am unique and I am special. Hello. I'm sorry, you can't go in now. Just hold on outside, we'll get back to you. Thank you. (somber music) Mommy. Mom, I'm sorry for everything that I've put you through. I mean, I know that I have stressed you this past few months. Stress is an understatement, I've done even worse. And I'm sorry, mommy. It's all right. Look, what matters to me is that you're happy. That you're a changed person. Because I know you like self. I know you well. Okay? Thank you, mom. Come, come. It's all right, my love. Thank you. Come on, come on. Can I go in, please? I'm sorry, not now, please. Can I just... Doctor, is there anything wrong? She's no longer responding to treatments. The metastases has spread beyond her pelvis. She needs surgery immediately. Can I see her? No. We're prepping up for surgery. All she needs now is your prayers. Our prayers. No. No, no! Mommy, can I ask you a question? Yeah, anything. Mommy, why did you leave daddy? Mommy, I really want to know. Your dad had... He was addicted to alcohol. He tried to quit. He tried to do right but he kept relapsing. And at some point I was seven months gone and you were about six years old. Your dad returned from work one evening. We had an argument, just an argument. And he beat me. He beat me to stupor and I lost the baby. Mommy, but you never mentioned it to us. We never even saw anything like... I know. You and your sister, you have this perfect picture of your father. I know how much you adored him. I wouldn't want to taint that canvas. I don't want to taint the picture. Mommy, I'm sorry you had to go through all of this. It's all right, it's all right. - It's all right. - I had no idea. And so when he had the accident, I just knew. I knew he had to be under the influence, to have run under the truck. I felt terrible. I'm so sorry, mom, that you had to go through all of this. I mean, daddy was... I thought daddy was perfect. The way he would cook, clean, whenever you traveled for work and we would even play dress up together. Your father was a good man. He just had his demons. But he hurt you. That's all in the past now, my darling. He was also a good husband when he wasn't under then influence. But once he was intoxicated, he became this monster, this thing I didn't get to even know. He became different, a total stranger. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about it. And that's why, Somto, when I saw you smoking, it brought back memories. Bad memories. I'm sorry, mom. Promise me, my darling (gentle music) That you'll stop smoking. I promise, mommy, I'll stop. I promise. I'm sorry. It's all right. It's all in the past. (phone ringing) Hey. How is she? Why aren't you inside? She hasn't woken up since the surgery. She's still unconscious. Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Don't worry, everything will be fine. No, it won't. Everything won't be fine. I knew I was going to lose her but, I didn't think it was going to be this soon. I'm not ready. But you know that we can never be too prepared to lose our loved ones. The pain can't be any less. I'm so sorry. Thank you for coming. It's okay. Any time. (gentle music) Please give me a moment with my wife. Of course. As long as you are alive, you cannot put your life on hold like you can with a game. So in the midst of all the bitterness and pain, take a deep breath and calm your nerves. I found answers in touching my deepest wounds. I found myself and I found solace. Hello? Can you hear me? [Ikenna] Hey, Somto. How are you? I'm fine. Guess what? I just completed my book. [Ikenna] Wow. That's great. I'm so proud of you. Thank you. Oh, I miss you too.
