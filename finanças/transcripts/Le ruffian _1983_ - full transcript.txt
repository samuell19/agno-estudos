Hey! Hi, Kenny. How are you? They're for you. They're going to the mine. -Do you have my eau de Cologne? -I couldn't find the big one. I got two small ones. Thanks. Bye, Kenny. No, sir. Donahue! Howard! Lacourt! Dalbert! Aldo Sévenac! Aldo! A perfect housewife! Hey! Send up another compressor! Aldo Sévenac. A vein of our own would be better. You're right, grandpa. But I've searched everywhere. I wouldn't be here if I'd found one. You are all bastards. The more good intentions you have, the more women have to watch out. Don't try the old line about a truck stuck at the border. I've heard it already. Here, sir. -Hello. -Hello, sir. I'll be right back. -And voilà! -No hands! -It can't be true. -It is. I must be dreaming. And this time, where are you coming from? Rather far away. Are you going to drink that? Here, beautiful. Pay yourself. So, this time, it's for real? And… How? I'll tell you later. When the Baroness hears this! By the way… -how is she? -She's sleeping. -At this hour? -She doesn't want to close. We work day and night, taking turns. She's sleeping… -alone? -Yes. I mean, usually. -I'll go upstairs and see her. -No, listen. It would be better if I prepare the ground. Why? Has she become emotional? Not really, but… But? I'll go. Don't worry. -I'm going. -I'll buy something in the meantime. -Don't worry, I'm going. -Sure. I'm going. Our life is a bouquet of violets that will never wither away. Not bad. Or else… that'll wither away if we don't believe in it. That's better. The keys are on the door. Baroness, this bouquet-- So? Still good at entertaining the ladies? Aldo? Did you sleep well? I made quite a breakfast for you. Here. Madame's coffee is served! Have you ever seen me drink coffee? No. But you could have changed your habits. Not for coffee. Well. I wanted to ask you… Did I leave some clothes here? Because I'd like to… In the attic. The attic. That's nice of you. Still. You could have written from time to time. To give some news. Don't you think? You can't write letters while making a fortune. And of course, you chose fortune. What's this? Another story. -Should I pretend to believe it? -You don't have to. -But still, it's gold. -I can see that. Do you have a lot of these? I'll tell you later. Fuck! Shit! Fucking hand brake! Hey loser, you've lost again? Hi, Aldo. Hi, Éléonore. It's funny. Lately, I've had the feeling you would come back. My goodness, what a reunion! Hold each other tight or you'll lose each other! I'll run over the first one to let go! I'll leave you two alone. I'll fix that shitty hand brake. Next time, I'll show you. No luck last time too. A dog crossed the track. You know, I admire you, Éléonore. -Nothing ever surprises you. -And you, Aldo. Are you still selling illusions? And this? Is it an illusion? Do you have lots of those? -I'll tell you later. -I get it, you only have one. Hey. See this? I have five like this waiting for me, full of nuggets. -Where at? -Down a waterfall. A waterfall! And of course, thousands of miles from here. Yes. In the Rockies. Aldo. Excuse me for one hour, I have a car to fix. I had your mail forwarded. Did you get it? So… Is she still living in London? I think so. Éléonore! Listen, this time, everything is true, I swear. And with the money we could go to Houston. And this thing… we could get rid of it! What? -Aldo! -What? Not again. He knows he'll never walk again. He accepted his situation, let him live with it. Let us live with it. By giving him this moped, you gave him back the taste for speed. While he still should be riding that thing. It's better than quitting, no? He'll break his nose against a mirage. OK, bring three glasses. I'll tell you everything. What were you talking about? Aldo. Even a lousy racer doesn't want to be taken for a fool. He'll walk, he'll never walk. A little miracle? Should I play the flute to go along with your sweet talk? Aldo. Why do you give a fuck if I walk or not? What's with you? What do you want? You want to go to heaven? You'll go to hell like everyone else. Leave us the fuck alone, or I'll burn the house down and you with it! I'll blow everything up! No. I wouldn't burn my old sidecar. The glasses! I'm no hero! Anyone can become one on any given day! John, you know quite a lot of people at the port. Yeah, why? -You can help us. -What do you mean? I need equipment. Equipment? What equipment? Well… I really have to explain it to you. Come. Get off. -It can't be. What are you talking about? -Yes. I started a list for the larger equipment. Let me show you. Have a look. Can you find all that for me? What? Do you realize what you're asking me? -Trucks… -Not "trucks", one truck! How much will it cost? Just for the guarantees… When we return, we'll give them double, even triple what they ask. But they care about when we leave. OK, I get it. I have an idea. -Maybe the Baroness? -No! No, John. Not the Baroness. Don't do that. Give me your word. It's easy. Find the equipment and you're a partner. We'll make you rich! -And I'll become a hero at the same time. -More than that. You'll become like Christ. Because you'll see my friend walk. That feels so good! Did you see that? What's the matter? -What's with you now? -Nothing! -Who'll get the chair now? -You, my friend. Yeah, you! Hey! -I'm glad to see you! -How are you? Good. -Hey, look who's there! -I'll be back. -Are you staying a few more days? -Yes. Next Sunday, Éléonore and I will celebrate our fifth anniversary. Will you come? Yes, of course! Give me your helmet. OK. I'll get a seat before you start. GRAND PRIX OF THE PROVINCES A track is a beautiful thing. I've wanted to tell something for a long time. Can I? I'm very glad it was your wheel that touched mine. That way, I don't hold a grudge against anyone. It helped me a lot. Hey! You can take it out. -Shall I bring the Dodge in? -Yes, if you don't mind. When these floats are pushed by 250 hp, it's going to be nice! 250 horsepower, what are you saying? -It's no big deal. -No big deal… -You want more every day. -We'll make you rich, I told you. Come on! Come on! Drop it here. Gérard, you see? -She'll have almost no draught this way. -Yes, especially on the grass. So you've said to yourselves, "The Baroness, that nice dumbbell, -will just take out her checkbook." -Stop it, Baroness. I'm a dead man. Or almost. I swore, do you understand? He made me swear on my honor I wouldn't ask you. Your honor? After ten years, Baroness, I thought you'd respect me more. John! Come back here. Your day isn't starting well. You know what will happen if I get angry? Imbecile! His friend's wife is charming. And so sweet! Come with us, Éléonore. We'll show you something. I'm happy for Gérard. I really am. You're really athletic. Thank you. Much less than I was. -I was a physical education teacher. -You can still stand. We deserve our gold. Come on, Aldo! Come on! He didn't age much. Neither did you. I think we're doing fine. Come on! Hang on! Six to one! -Yeah, I won some races. -How fast did you go? Rather fast. Don't touch that, sweetie. What's that heavy stuff? Yeah, that machine weighs a lot. See that thing up there? It's here to keep the balance when it's on two wheels. Do you want us to push you? Yes! Happy anniversary Happy anniversary! Happy anniversary Happy anniversary! Now, the special one, the one for the Grand Prix. The last one we have. Give it to me. Watch out, step back. Ready? Any news from John about the hoist and the truck? No, but I trust him. We shouldn't wait too long, though. We have time. Where the crates are, they are safer than in a bank. Trust me. I wanted to ask you. The Indians… What about them? What could have become of them? Do you know? No. Everybody goes their own way. They are interested, but they want to think about it. Let them think about it. You're staying for dinner, Aldo? I can't. I'm going to dinner with the Baroness. -What time is it? -Almost 5:00 p.m. Well, kids. -I'll see you tomorrow. -Right. Come and sit. Soon, we'll be in the Rockies. Not bad for the honeymoon we never had. Don't get carried away by his dreams. He always gets over it. Even if his story is only a dream, it's too beautiful not to go with him. Do we need gold crates? -Of course not. -So? Come on, let's go! Something wrong? Nothing. I think you look great. Thanks to the candles? And shadows? Time goes by, Aldo. Not for you. Is that a declaration? Why not? When you come back from your trip? No. Anyway, the next trip will be short. Wait. Are we speaking about the same thing? Because with you… Yes. Frankly, Aldo… A treasure under a waterfall? Really! -You don't believe it. -No. You don't? Well, you'll see. Do you know where I'll take you after? To an island in the sun. Don't you want to go to an island in the sun? -Everyone does. -So what? I'll take you to a wonderful place, where I have wonderful friends. Ruffians, probably. You know, Baroness, We have a whole life to have fun. And all death to rest. -Thank you, good night. -Good night. -These crabs weren't bad. -No. -Do you want to walk a little? -Yes. Can you see at night with your blue eyes? My eyes are black, bastard! That's how I landed in Canada. As a clandestine. -How old were you? -16. A tough journey. In the captain's cabin? Bastard! Have you seen a guy running? Medium-sized, 25 years old. -What has he done? -We don't know, he ran off. -We haven't seen anyone. -Thanks. As long as one still has his legs to run… I brought someone who wants to buy a car. I don't want to distract you from your hard work. What are you doing? Rehearsing a play? You're right, we're working too hard. How about a small intermission? It's chilly at first, then it's alright. -Coffee? -Oh yes, thanks! The picnic was a good idea. Usually on Sundays, it's shopping. One doesn't want to get old, the other wants to stay young, we're not broke! There are some men you just can't do without. She's crazy! Never tell them such a thing! Too late! Are you really a Baroness? I was a singer. A baron used to send me truckloads of roses. -Jealous people nicknamed me the Baroness. -Why did you stop? After a while, roses give you a headache! And all that packing and unpacking. I wanted to settle. Unfortunately for me, the thirsty ones like me. Baroness, where did they go? Over there, on the right. -That's smart. -You didn't tie it well, my friend. You find that funny? How do I come back, now? Don't disturb the fish. Go to the other side, if you want. You speak of them as if they were one person. -Did you meet them together? -Yes. Together. Great catch! I was on holiday in France, in the fall. I was visiting the Eiffel Tower with a group. At first, people in my group screamed. But I was captivated. Listen to me, young man. Come on, don't do it. Come back to the stairs, come on! I don't want to live anymore! I've been lied to too much! Look at these people. How nice they are. All liars! Come back. Let's have a drink. Come on. It's forbidden to jump off the Eiffel Tower. I don't care! I wanted to run, to pull him back. I think I loved him from that moment. So long, you bastards! I think they wet their pants! I had two weeks of holidays left. At first, I didn't understand their life. Having fun while they worked. Or working while having fun. So? Is it OK? Can you look at the back? So? I bet 50 more! Come on, Aldo! I couldn't look at my plane ticket anymore. Hey you, my money! -What money? You've lost! -Lost? Don't touch me! Stop it! Stop it, already! Aldo! Aldo! Éléonore! Good Lord! Departure for Montreal and Chicago, flight Air France 031, immediate boarding, gate 45. I tried to leave them like in an American comedy. Let's get married. Where? In the plane? I'll come and get you. I'll win a few races and I'll come. He always believed he would win. Later, he would look like his friend Aldo. Aldo, who believed life was still before him. See you soon. I'll wait for you. -One day, they came back. -How convenient for them. No! Don't believe that. They didn't come for comfort nor pity. Gérard didn't even want to see me. It was Aldo who brought him back. It was one night, I remember. We hardly spoke. Excuse me. -You're not sleeping? -No. Not with that expedition to organize. Look. You see here? That's the mine he was working at. And there, is Wapta Falls. -The current took the crates away. -No. I spoke with guys who know rapids. It's a backflow phenomenon. -They stay right under the falls. -If you say so. How much does that joke cost? About $50,000. Mostly because of the guarantees. Do you still have a minute for me? Put this on an account. If you tell that bastard about it, we'll no longer be friends. Gérard! We've got the truck and trailer! The pontoon. Fasten your seat belt. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Aldo. It's better that way. Here it is! Where are you going? "And from the top of their white caravel, they watch rise from the horizon new bright stars." I hope you don't plan to travel unnoticed. See, Baroness? Better than a tent. No snakes. And rheumatism. Did you see that? It's a real fairy tale, isn't it, John? So, you're finally joining them? Yes, luckily. You've thought it through? You're not coming? No, I hate camping and mosquitoes love my skin. -You want anything to drink? Coffee? -No. Aldo! Hey, once we're on the river, how long till we reach the waterfall? Not more than a day and a half, if all goes well. It can take eight days. I'm in no hurry. We're gonna fill up here. It's the last station. Aldo. It's over. Look, it's over. Gérard, give me the keys, please. -Go get some beer, I'll fill up the tank. -OK. I thought you'd get angry. -Do you have beer? -Certainly. -Give me three packs for thirsty men. -Right away. What did those two do to you? They disturbed our sleep last night. And for my friend, sleep is sacred. What's this machine? -Is it for the lake? -No! We're going to Wapta Falls. -You're going to set up a dam. -No! -We're conducting a search. -A search? What kind? The kind that isn't your business. Give me a beer, Jacko. John! -Put your life vest on. -Me? -Why? Is it dangerous? -Do it! Yeah! We'll berth after the turn. John, watch the front. Gérard, come here. Here, take this. Éléonore, you'll throw me the rope when I tell you. -Here. Is that better? -Yeah. Careful on the right! Careful in front! More, Gérard! Throw it. Stop the engine, Gérard. I've moored the hoist cable. Let it go until I say stop. Give me my gloves. Éléonore, the rope. -John, give it to me. -Yes. You, go up there and lift. Give me some slack, Gérard. -Watch out your fingers! -Yeah! Go on, stretch it. Good. -Aldo! -What? -Do you think we can touch the bottom? -You? No. Éléonore, wait. Let it go, Gérard. Go on. Keep going, Gérard. Easy! Keep going. Go on! Let it go! Give me some slack, Gérard! Let it go. John, don't stay there, I can't see a thing! Keep going, Gérard! There! That's it, you can start to… Start to slow down. Good. That's good. Ready? There! Let's go. -Can I let go? -Yeah. Holy cow! Gérard, can you hear me? I'm in position. Listen to me. Aim to the right of the dead tree. To the right of the dead tree, got it. -Gérard. -Yes! Give me the hook. Give. Yeah. Remember when we screwed around on the Eiffel Tower? Go ahead, pull. Aldo! Thank you. Are you OK? Good morning. Good morning. Can I help you? Some friends told me about a nice waterfall in the area. Wapta Falls. You sound like you come from far away. Pretty far, yes. Just like those who were here. They were going to Wapta Falls. They're waiting for me and my Zodiac. -Do you have a boat? -No. You'll need a boat for sure. So… can I take you? -Here! -Slowly, don't drop it! The crate is full of water. You'll see. -Look at that! -Give me the pliers. Here. Aldo, we have the first one. We're just trying to open it. That's it! That's it! Shit. Let me see. I didn't believe it. -Aldo! -Baroness, if you could see this! Aldo! Hey. Besides the trip, there's also gold! -I've got it. -Pull slowly. -Come on! -What? -There's a third one. -Let it down. There. That's it. He says he can't find more but he keeps looking. Tell him to come back, it's too risky. Here's the third one. Watch your feet. Hello, my friends! Hey, shorty. Do you remember me? You know him? -No, I mean… -Harting! Nelson Harting. Baroness! -What do you want? -Weren't you expecting him? Not really. In this region, it's best to carry a gun. However… I come as a friend. A friend who's very interested in your search. Especially when you talked about the falls when you bought your beer. I'm talking, while your friend below is running out of oxygen. Let's pull him out, then. First, I'd like these three crates to be loaded onto my zodiac. They're too heavy. They can't lift them. The two ladies look to be in good shape. They'll help you. You too. I don't obey anyone. No! Should your friend go for a bath? Leave him alone. Hey, champion! What are you doing? Is it coming or not? John! What will you say when this is over? That Aldo ran out of air? That we had no luck? Come on! John! On a given day, anyone can become a hero. If I wanted to… Harting! It'll be a crime of fear. He'll empty the whole magazine! Baroness! I'm a hero! I'm a hero! I'm a hero! I'm a hero! I'm a hero! I'm a hero! It seems I don't have the upper hand. However, I've always been a good sport. Harting is a good sport. Not this way. This way. There's no trail this way. It will take me at least two days to get out. Good, we won't have to worry. Or you can go for a swim. John. Explain it to me. What happened with that guy? We met at the motel. And? We talked. About what? He asked me where we were going. And you told him what we were doing. Is that it? We must celebrate such stupidity! Aldo, give it to me! The price of gold has gone up. $22,000 per kilo. -Always in on the best deals, Baroness. -Yes! Let's do it. Aldo? Get up, you bastard! Even when I'm dead, you won't believe me.
