- What? - We've a big problem, Ace. - Why? - Don't tell me, you haven't noticed. - Of course, not. Why? - What do you think? I'm with you, Tiago. Day and night. - Why else would I pay you? - To cover your ass. - One more mistake and you're out! - OK. - Quick. All right. Be cool. - What's the problem anyway? - Get your ass here. - OK. - Do you have a problem? - What are you, a psychologist? What are you still doing here? Waiting for a coffee? Go to work! PIMP Meekly, Macau. I said, lie down, Macau. All right. And what? You'll pay me to find you a girl. Here. It's yours problem, not worth the money Good, I've got him. To give you back what? Half of the money? Half of the girl?! Madhouse! I knew that thinking thing. Everybody wants to bully me today. - Hey, Ace! - Fuck off. Ines! Nazmi! Are you waiting for the bus? You have arthritis? Shit. - Looking for the car keys? - Everything is fine. Only I pay bonuses here! And if you don't calm down in three minutes, we will meet privately! Distance, okay? Come in, feel yourself at home. Ace, Rodrigue. Rodrigue, Ace. It seems like he was looking for trouble. The wine is wonderful. - Do you know how mature is that wine, Ace? - I am better in girls, Tiago. We know each other for 20 years, Ace... So, is this wine. Wine needs time and good grapes to mature. The problem with grapes is that one rotten cluster is enough... to ruin the whole crop. Our problem... is called... rat. And I think I found one. What would you say? I swear, Ace... It's not me. What rat would say he's the rat? Let me go or I'll work your face to a pulp! Problem, Ace is that sometimes there are two rotten clusters. Frank thinks you're second. Right? And you believe that filthy whore? I don't trust anyone if I doubt it. Doubt makes me crazy. Doesn't allow me to sleep. I get nervous, pessimistic. I don't see anything. And you can make me especially nervous, Ace. I have to get back my sleep soon. I don't want to dump it on you. Clear? Absolutely. Don't worry. Now get out. Well, you in the fucking car, huh? What is happening now? Damn, he's got a problem! He left through back door. Fast! Shit! Let's go. Body is so burned, like charcoal. - Are you sure it's him? - Yes, our microphone was on him. Give me the purse! Give me the purse, I said! Why you don't give me the purse, huh? The purse! The purse, immediately! Give it to me! I said, give it to me! Bastard! You killed my boy! Asshole! Look! You killed him! Kill him! Drop the gun! Turn around! Face the wall! Gun went off by itself. It wasn't me. Why did you argue with that guy? Was it about your business in Marseille? Marseille? I've been bank clerk in Paris, for 12 years. Foreign Service, Bureau 114! Listen Ace... a bank employee? But of course! I practice ice skating, he's my coach. - Stop making fool of us! - I'm not. I have a clean criminal record... no points deducted from my driving licence and I don't know who is Ace. I'm Gilbert Chapelle. Look... And now I want to go home, I'm tired. - I can come back tomorrow... - Sit your ass down! - It's not me. - So, who's this? Again, it's not you? Looks like me. I recognize myself, but it's not me. He recognizes himself, but it's not him. Until now I wasn't sure, but now... He's fucking around with us! Let's start again. Name, surname? Gilbert Chapelle, born October 2nd, 1969, in Porte de la Chapelle. - Forget it, he's not Ace. - Then who is he? Gilbert Chapel, abandoned on the day of birth... Region 18, Porte de la Chapelle. - Yes, it's me. October 2, 1969 - the same birth date. - Paris, district 18. - The same place. The same moron. - What I was talking about all morning, eh...? - Did you know that you have a twin brother? - Excuse us for the error. - Twin brother? How come? I have a twin brother? We'll send you over to the Brigade Criminelle in Paris. Good luck with the process. With a good lawyer you'll get at least 20 years. - 20 years? - 20 years... Come on... have a nice day! Can't be... This is a nightmare! - Wait, there may be a solution. - What? - It will not happen. - What? - But... - Wait... If you tell me, I'll understand. Tell me. If in our report... we decide to write that everything was just a silly mistake... and death was accidental... you'll get out after three years. - Yes, even conditionally. - In return you will take the place of your brother. - My brother, well. His boss prepares a deal with one Colombian. We need to know the date, time and place. Your brother played us until now but then he took sabbatical leave. So you replace him until we have the info, and voila. It's not so complicated. I don't know... it doesn't sound complicated, but... I didn't understand everything. My brother... What does he do for living? - Who is this? - Your new best friend. - Can I have your glasses? - Yes. Good day. I'll wait in the car. A pimp never says good day. This hit is called "whore slap". Good swipe with open palm. What's my name? No idea, they told me nothing. This is a slap with other side of hand, the "pimp stallion". - What's my name? - I don't know... Bouba? - I don't know, they didn't tell me! - Repetition is the mother of knowledge. Wait, wait! Stop, I'll do whatever you want! All right. Listen to rule number one. To be respected, pimp always first uses aggression. Now I know you will not forget my name. Slim le saurien. What's my name? Slim! Slim! Slim! Well done, my friend. These two will now leave you. Try to escape, I'll beat you, understood? Here is the info about your whores, your habits, the places you hanging, your boss. - Learn it by heart. We start tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Wait, are you crazy? - And now we go to studio for engraving. - What? And, no... I will not do it! Respect Babtou. She is blind, so she puts her talent in her fingers. Do not move and everything will be fine. - Repeat the lesson! - If the girls steal, it's ok, they under my controll... If they have fun... I secure... Relax... it's ready. It hurts, it hurts a lot. Be careful, it hurts. You tickle me. What is she... Another important rule: pimp never scream like a girl. With the fists! Number one: Tiago Mendes, my boss. Boss of the Calao. My target. With the knee. Take a look. Number two: Luna, one of the dancers, my darling. - Photo. - Sorry. Once again, carefully... Your hands! Knees upwards! Faster! So... with the shoulders. Chest forward. Are you Slim le saurien? You don't know anything! Number 9: Franky, right hand of Mendes. Killer. You started to learn. I hit, did I? Come here! What is my name? Ace! What is my name? Ace! Take that... What is this shit? Cool, isn't it? This is one of my henchmen, Mario. - Marco! Marco, fuck! - Yesterday I knew it! This will screw up everything! Review! Tomorrow we'll come again. Wait! You haven't seen everything. Wait! I destroy with my eyes. I'm the boss! Playboy of the neighborhood! I do what I want. What? Do you have a problem? Okay, you? Not bad, but there is still work to be done. Two days left! How so? It is perfect. Come on, say it! Say that I'm the best. - Shit, tell him! - You are the best! - Who? - Ace! You're the best, Ace! Let us go, damn! Ace, we said it! I am great! I spit on you! - You're calm, we can pick you up. - Do you feel better? Wait. Here... we're missing something. - This. - Well, yes. - What? - Something. What is missing? That's better. Go. Ace! That nose of yours ... What have they done, bastards? - It's cool to see you, Ace. - No! - What's wrong? - Nothing. - If you want... - Stop! Quiet. - The same you! Well I know! - You know me? Mario... Marco! I don't want you to know me! Did you hear? I don't want to! Never! Clear? And you? It's you! For sure! One more word and I'll kill you! You know what? Get in the car and go! Disappear! Go away! - What an idiot... - I've heard you! I don't know if you heared me well, Marco? Get lost! See how he disapeared. Now you have to do without a car. It made no sense. Oh, yes, it would be good if you showed up again in the neighborhood. Since your disappearance, Franky follow us closely. This jerk took your place at Mendes. - I saw it. - Damn Franky... Picture number 9. That's a tough guy! By the way... This is yours. Oh, yeah, can I? Velvet, OK? Hey, what are you doing here? Calm down, calm down, woof! Shit. Ace, ace, ace... - Have you been beaten? What happened? - Marco came by in Calao yesterday. He told us to come here. Are you okay? - Well... - What is it? What happened? It was my stupid puppy. When he saw me at the door and was so glad... He did all this? He started peeing everywhere and I had to throw him out. You look terrible... We thought something happened to you. We were worried sick. All right. Keep it up. You like them and I like that. Would you like some, girls? Great furniture, huh? And again, work OK? Quite good. This too. I bought it because... it fits. - Okay. Understood. Is that what you want? No need for the games. Here is turnover. The whole week is on the table. This is one week? We did not know what happened. We were not in the mood. - You were not in the mood? - We will think about work. We are now yours. - You want some massage, Ace? - With pleasure. Wait, I'd rather... I need to breathe... What is this mess? Ace? - Thiago wants to see you. This is urgent. - Who? Wait... Tiago? It's you. I don't want to see you! - OK, I'm not here. - I'm not here. Understood? Okay, let's go. Ace. You going to see Tiago. - Shit... shirt. - And comb your hair. MARSEILLE IS MINE - I was worried about you. - No need, Tiago. I'm indestructible. Hey... Franky! You must have had fun with the cops, huh? Not much, but I gave them resistance. - I gave them hell. - Very well, Ace. Because I am doing it all wrong. My sleep getting worse. And I think that Franky was right about you. I also Tiago. And I think just like you. You're great, Ace. You're great... in annoying me! - What was with the cops? - Nothing. They questioned me for murder. - Do not worry. - What murder? Body found in the sea with a bullet in the head. He drowned. They wanted to know who shot him after he drowned. - Rodrigue? - If Rodrigue I have nothing... to do with him, Tiago, I swear. What are you talking about? Rodrigue was killed before your eyes! Tiago, I didn't say anything! Neither your name nor the name of Franky. Cops don't know anything. - I told you from the beginning, he is their rat. - I'm not! I'm not a rat. But... I know who is. - Really? - He worked with Rodrigue. Once I saw him, I told myself... "He's got a real rat's head". - I must tell Tiago. - Do I know him? What's his name? I don't know, but I'll recognize him without a problem. I'm listening... He is not very big... between 20 and 50 years old... Maybe 30, but he's very simple. Enough nonsense, Ace. I want you to find him. Franky will gladly go with you. If you're bluffing, Franky who is good at magic will make you disappear. Give me a week and... Three days. Otherwise Franky will enchant you. - But... - Two days sounds better. - Now get out and get my envelope from the Jap. - The Jap? - Well done! Hats off to your work! - Calm down... I had to play my brother to deal with criminals, Japanese and eventually they'll kill me! Calm down... There is only one way to restore Mendes confidence - do whatever he says. - We'll find someone to kill. - You are crazy! You've already killed one in the underground parking so you can do it again! This is to much. Find someone else to replace my brother. Maybe mother have had triplets and left a third one at the Porte de Montreull! Your office is down the street. Go there or you'll rot in jail for 20 years! Leave me alone. I'll be fine. Wait, Ace. - But... - What I just said? All right. You stay here. - OK, come with me. - Are you sure? Yes... come in. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Table for three? Counting properly. But we are not here to eat, but to pick up the envelope. Envelope? I do not understand. Rectangular piece of paper with a stamp that says - for Mendes. Go look for it quickly. Translates "envelope" to Japanese. I have a good feeling. What are you looking for? Money? There is no money. This is a restaurant. - You eat, or else... get out! - Hey, calm down! Tell your wife to calm down. I'm geting toughest job. I leave you to finish it... Get out! - Sami? Marco? What are you doing? - Classic methods. - Pay or receive a bullet. - As usual. Wait a minute. And how they will give us the envelope, if they are dead? - Correct. - And what I say to Tiago? That corpses are looking for envelope in the restaurant? Honestly, you will not explain it to him. What's wrong? Usually you initiator. - Qu pasa? - Qu pasa? It's that... - Go... show them. - Thank you but I'll stand up. I want a different approach. Go to work! Great, we've got the envelope. Goodbye. Excuse me! Wait! Tell Mr. Mendez I was sorry for the delay. - I promise, I will not be repeated. - Where did that suddenly come from? - Do not touch me restaurant, please. - Get out. Well done. Two of you and confused the place. - What kind of men are you? - I tried to say, but you stopped me. You shut up? Don't say anything! Do not complain... afterwards. Hello? Yes. Who? Mom? - Hello, Ace! - Hello. Beretta 92. Brand new. Your cousins experienced great difficulty to find it. How often have I dreamed of the moment... Nonsense. If you dreamed of this gun, I had to think of where I live. A serial number erased with the acid. You can easily use on the rats. I have so much to say... Don't start again. We already agreed on the price. - What is this stupid smile? - Please? You're trying to cheat me know? No, no. Except... Recently, I keep thinking about he other one. What other one? My twin, who you left in Paris. Ah, yes... I told you. There is nothing to add to it. We were together for a very short time. I want to know why you left me and not him? Other way around... Why dumped him and not me? Why? Why am I here... and he is not? Because you're the best, Ace. The best? Why? Simple. I did not know that I would have twins. And when I gave birth, I realized... I would have thirteen kids standing at the counter. Thirteen, you hear me? Thirteen! But never! Never! Vade retro! - And just like that? - I've been in shit up to my neck. I was unlucky my whole life. So to determine which one to leave... I dropped among you my last bill. Unprecedented! Two seconds, Ace... the time you needed to catch it. I still remember the wide, big eyes of the other, sort of... just like yours now. And you never try to... to find him, or... I don't know. Why? If something grows only in his corner... to advance at work. From small one it was obvious that it would end badly. As a lawyer or a cop. Yes, cop! Or banker. How funny you're sometimes! It would be a miracle - a banker in the family! Oh, you're stupid! Ace? Ace? What's wrong? You've been here two days, it is disturbing. You can't understand, Luna. I fell into a big hole. Listen, Ace, we all have these days. But I've never seen you like that. Me neither, Luna. And I haven't seen that, either. But this is some old wound... very old. I can't explain it. - Is it better now? - Yes. Don't take this the wrong way, but... I think you have to visit jail more frequently. It's true that since you left jail... something in you has changed. - Are you sure? I don't know. You're somehow delicate and fragile... - But it's much better. - Yes. It happens. It's just the prison. Yes. I don't know myself... what is going on. - I'll get ready for Calao. - Yes, do it. - And who is this guy? - From our department. We've chosen the good one, to avoid any complications. And the fat one. Impossible to miss. Just pop three bullets into his bulletproof vest, and voila. Why not with the blanks? Franky will be with you at that time. Just shoot and that's it. We'll take no chances. And we cover you, don't worry. Honestly, you're very dumb to think of fake murder. Our man. We'll wait in an hour in the restaurant. Now call Franky and tell him that you found a rat. Well, where he is? Only one is fat. Don't bother me with your questions. Let's go. No, Franky, you stay. I'll go. That seems quite nice restaurant. - Where's your man? - Right there. This fatso? How's going... Wilfried? - Don't you recognize me? - No. Ace. With the "A". Ace! Now you recognized me? Shit, it's unbelievable. He confused the fat man. You don't know me? A few years ago I met a type like you. Simple, silent, without a story. And I met him at a restaurant, where nothing ever happens. Family atmosphere, not too expensive, just like this. Expensive or not, who cares. Now let's finish with this nonsense and go. And he had the daily special, just like you... Spider Crab, Chablis... And was in such a hurry to swallow... suddenly... Choked, collapsed and then... He began to roar without reason. What are you doing? Reading Michelin Guide? Do it! - I'm just a little... - Do it fast! - Do you know why he started crying? - Not really. He doesn't know. - You don't know? - No. - How come you don't know? - Huh? He doesn't know. - Ace... put him down, or I'll do it. - Okay. What? I have no gun. And how will you shoot him without a gun? What are you talking about? I don't know you. Don't start to kick the table, or I get that crab and... Shit! See? You see now what you did?! Today you die! Oh, today you will lose your head! - Ace, you're just a loser. - Loser, me? I'm a looser? Give me this! All out! I am a loser? Get up! Wipe this sauce from your mouth! Now you will die like a man. Watch me. Watch here! You'll die like a man. Come on! You'll die like a man! - Like a man. - Finish that garbage. I'll deal with this scum. What was this? This is the rat. He wanted to play us. Fortunately, I was alert. - I just saved our lives. - And who's this?! Distraction! See my hand? You start shit again I will come back... and I'll kill you! Ace, buddy! Where is he anyway? Lost or something? Dude, picture number 6. What's up, buddy? Where have you been, buddy? - What's wrong? - Relax. Shut up, I said! Shut up! My babies. Prepare them for fight. Every day, six hours locked in the car. In full sun. Motivate them. Shut up, I said! I see, how they obey you. What do you think? They are gladiators! I don't give them one gram of meat for a month, otherwise they become fat. Ace, are you my friend or not? I need a favor. Put some money on me with the bookmaker and you will get your share. - You are my friend. - Yes... your and your dogs. - Until next time. - Hey! If you need anything, call. - All right. Bye. - Bye. Shut the fuck up! I'll kill you! I'm the boss! Who's the Daddy? I'm the Daddy! What lies behind this dinner, Ace? Nothing Luna, nothing. I... I have nothing to hide. I thought we need a little rest. TTD, little candlelight. What? - TTD. - TTD? Tip Top Dinner. Do you remember when was our last TTD? - A few weeks ago? - Yeah, right. - Months? - Years ago, Ace. - Really. - Seven years, exactly. Just what I said, we work and work... And see.. The time goes by. Would you like some champagne? Waiter? A bottle of champagne. The most expensive and most chilled, please. - Isn't that Chapelle? - With the girl? If you are patient, I promise, you'll rediscover old Ace. I swear on my head. Promise of Ace. - Chapelle? - Yes. - Gilbert Chapelle? - I don't know you. Chapelle, how are you? What a incredible meeting! Hello. I'm Olivier Vergnaut, colleague of Chapelle. In fact, his boss... Chappelle went on the sick leave, but doesn't look sick. - I don't know you. Do you know him, Luna? - No. - Get lost. - Even the others have recognized you. Come here. We are at the seminar here in Marseille. Hello, Chapelle... Miss. Relax Chappelle. He is not that pedant from the bank. Would you introduce us to your lady. Did you happen not to have any girlfriends of the lady? - Do you often bother the strangers? - What's wrong? Trying to impress your lady? I'll tell you who I am, I am idiot! There's nobody here, you know. Clear? Now get out. And you, assholes, you know my name? My name is Ace! Clear? Now get out. I'm crazy. Come on, seminar. Photocopiers! You know, Luna? The world is full of people... who know each other but do not exist. Where's my champagne? I don't understand you. Why not the Arsenal? Arsenal is the club for you. Read the contract. What's bothering you? They speak English and drive on the left. Complicated. These people can't play football. You'll go for one year and will come back a star. You'll see, it will all be worthy if you go to Arsenal. Here, Tiago. - Excuse me! - Sylvain. - Ace. I am your true fan! I've watched all your games. You are... Ace left us alone, please. Listen to me. If you send Sylvain to Arsenal, they will put him on the bench. Here at Olympic, he is a star. Why to waste a time. He's right. I will not leave Olympic Marseille. This is my club, my city, my region. And I understand that field, the ball, and the ball understands me. I don't want to argue with you nor with your ball. I give you a week to think about it. You both... you and your ball. Agreed? Thank you, Sylvain. Until later. And congratulations for the match on Saturday. - What are you doing? - He is a miracle! I need a miracle with someone like him. I invested a lot in this transfer. If it fails, I will lose a fortune! Do anything, Ace. He must sign the contract! What happens with Colombians? When I need you to know, you would know. Get lost. Sorry. Sorry. Awesome! - Franky wants to see you. - Book him an appointment. Franky? Appointment? Really. He waits for you in the parking lot. He expects you alone. All right. Marco, you and I are one. Come on. Franky is not an idiot. He can count to three. If we're with you, he will immediately smell danger. Yes, that's true. Then I go alone. Your friend Pippo found me today. He wanted to show me something. Any idea what it is? Pippo? I got a vague idea who that is... I'm very nervous, Ace. He wanted to sell me pictures. Only he aske to much. Way, to much. I've already said. Pippo... is simple Pippo. He always exaggerates. And how much would you pay for this? What are you doing with two cops from the drug squad? What is this nonsense? Why Pippo didn't tell me? Let me just catch him and he will hear from me! I will give you that pleasure, Ace. Only I'm not sure he can hear us. Asked for to much. Get in. Thiago will like the photos. You're right, Ace. Together we are one. - What did you do? - We have seen that he threatened you and... Reflex. Fucking reflex! I don't want you to say anything! Another problem! What we say to Tiago if he ever realizes that Franky is dead? Hold on, Franky. Hold on... He is already quite dead. Do not stand there, call an ambulance, police, somebody! Cops? Are you crazy, Ace! Tiago will be angry if there is a corpse. But if there's not one... Exactly. What, what, what? Have you any idea, how to make him disappear? If you need anything, my dogs and me are ready. The gladiators! Come on. Wait. That thing. Come on. Good idea. Pitbulls are worse than piranhas. Makes you wonder. What do you want? I don't understand shit. They slept for days. I haven't given them anything to eat. If it can comfort you, pitbulls are better off than you. They were eaten while still asleep. Don't worry to much. Shit, motherfucker... you're lucky one. You're the only one who bet Doggy Bag will lose all the fights. - Ace! - What's up, Tiago? How far are you with Wiltord? Will he sign? - Don't worry, everything is going according to plan. - I hope. Have you seen Franky? Nobody has seen him. Franky? No. I swear to Sammy and Marco, haven't seen him. Every time I call him I get his voice mail. You must be persistent. He's like death. I mean, he likes to pray. I'll call him. All line up. I don't understand, Tiago. I know nothing. Franky would never give his phone to anyone. All sing! I am just five minutes late. Colombian's cargo arrived last night. And where is your info? We are tired of fixing your fuck-ups? More useless then his brother! We want to know when, how and where Mendes will meet with Colombians? - I know nothing about them! - What is your plan? I'll tell you what's my plan! Every night I wake up having nightmares. Then I remember that I'm the boss of the prostitutes. I've never done those things! And then they come into my room and begin dum-bum-bang! Every five minutes! I'm not here, I'm not there. It's madness! I'm going crazy! Brace yourself. You have to finish the mission. Or your life will never be long enough to finish the sentence! My life will not last till the verdict. Just kill me. My balls look like a tea bags! So, we agreed? This time no mistakes. Whatever you think, goes first through me. We will not force him. Slowly. We hit at the right place. Sylvain! How are you? I can't live without you! - Tiago isn't here? - No, but I'm here. The whole place is reserved for us. Cool, isn't it? If Thiago wants me to go to Arsenal, I stand by my decision. Relax, we're not on the field, don't play defense. - Now to start the game. - I decided not to sign for Arsenal. Let's relax and meanwhile... these two will help you to see what's missing in the contract. Don't push me, I will not go to Arsenal. Did you read the contract? - Anything to drink? - No, thanks. Sami, would you give him the contract to read? - Just a little bit. - No, no. Come on, just a little drink. Shit! Bastards! You broke my knee! Season is fucked! Call the ambulance! Fast! As requested, Ace. Hitting the right spot. It hurts! My knee! Here is the contract. And an autograph for my cousin, please. - It hurts! It hurts! - His name is Kevin. - What is it, Ace? He will sign. - It hurts! Help, fast! And why should he sign? - To go to Arsenal. - Yes. - All right. And what would he do at Arsenal? - Will play football. - So... And how to play football? - My knee! I'm feeling bad! With the ball. And? - And, and, and what? - And? - With feet, shit! - Well, yes! Idiot! - Is there been a light burning? - It wasn't me! It wasn't me... And what about Arsenal? He will play with his hands? - Call the ambulance! - Come on, Sylvain! I can hear you! We have our problems. What I will tell Tiago now? No need to tell him. If we say we couldn't find him... - It hurts, it hurts... - Shut up! - Pitbull! - No, we'll hide him. - Well, with pitbulls... - You, out of here! Get the fuck out of here! You, help me. Sylvain, we will try to fix your leg. Ok? - No! No! - Yes, yes, carefully. One... - No! No! - Two, three! Here! Like new! Are you Ok? You need to deliver, Ace, otherwise I'll bury you alive under this pitch. Relax, Tiago. I've arranged everything. Shit, watch out for the holes! This is the best stadium in the world! Complaine again and I'll break and the other knee. Keep smiling, they're watching us. Here they are. Hallo. Have you thought over our proposal? Ready to renegotiate the insurance policy? Yes, we were discussing the problem with injuries. Of course. But look at him anyway. See how fast he is moving. Isn't he in great shape? Make him an ambassador of your Insurance Group and you win thousands of new customers. Plus the impact on the shares... I calculated that every time he scores it adds at least 3 % value. This year Sylvain... scored 32 goals durin the season. Here are some numbers for the year. It's not just a nice of profits, is exponential growth! Excuse me, what does he do? I don't see him practicing. If you want to see him training, you have to be here at 6 a.m. - Were you awake at 6 a.m.? - No, not today... Then what are we talking about? I'll explain what is going on. Tomorrow Sylvain plays his last match for Olympique. And he came to feel the grass. Yes, gentlemen, this is the power of great champions. And you know? You don't deserve him. Let's go, Mr. Mendez... - Wait... - Excuse us. Let's go. What are you doing, Ace? They wanted to sign. Listen... If the rise in earnings is satisfactory we could discuss the contract again. What do you think? It depends. For a broken leg... how high would you go in terms of compensation? Good work, Ace. You have your ticket to deal with Condor. The Condor? The Colombian? Does it sound like he's Russian? We'll meet tomorrow in the Calao to talk about business. Well guys, take him back! Hey, Marco. Bring the car to car-wash. Well, he's out. - Shit, he looks sour. - This morning he was paranoid as hell. You should've seen what he did with one of his chick. - Wait. - What? - Is it from you? - What? - Walk again. - Is it you or not? - Let me go! Okay, calm down. - See, that's you. - Shit, he wears a microphone! I'm exposed! Come get me, quick! Later, I... Shit. Come on! Everybody fall asleep? Sophie! Natalie! Champagne! Circle of Ace! Where are you all? I can't hear you! Get out! Get out, bitch! - Come get me out, dammit! - If we move in, there will be slaughter! What's he doing with his microphone? Get me the fuck out of here! - Are you all right, Ace? - Shut up! Shit, I lost him. It wasn't very nice. What are you doing? Go look in his jacket he threw in the audience! I'm sure you had a microphone. Yes and two cops in their car outside the Calao. "Damn, I'm surrounded, they are going to kill me." You're talking nonsense, Thiago! - Shit! - What about this? What is this blood? This one? The girl did it. A real tigress. Didn't crossed your mind that Franky could be a rat? - Nothing in his jacket. - Of course not! You knocked on the wrong door. I'm completely clean. I have a business and girls to take care of. I need money. Now give me the room to work with Condor or if you don't need me... give me a break. Let's have a drink. The deal is for 50 million. Tomorrow afternoon at the Hotel Castille. 10 million in cash, and the remaining 40 million transferred via the Internet... to the account of Condor given to Tiago. - And drugs? - In a numbered container... stored somewhere on the docks. Once the 40 million is paid, Tiago gets the number of the container. We will contact you one hour before the attack. What are you talking about? What attack? I will not attack! No, no, no... I prefer 20 years in jail then to be dead! - Give me your shirt. - No, I have finished the job. Enough! I'm sick! - Drive, he agreed. - I will not attack! Assholes! Hijo de puta! You can slap me all you want, Mom, but he lied. You gave the Beretta to the other one. And the person who got the slap in the face, is me, real Ace. Cousins, come over here. On the count of three... grab the note. Get ready. One... two... three! Honestly, Mom. You could at least test me with genuine banknotes. No respect! Stupid me! I should drown him the moment he was born. Cops somehow figured out to put the twin brother into play? A plan that I had prepared for months. I fake my death... to take the money from the deal between the Colombian and Tiago. Nobody could accuse me! Neither the cops, nor Tiago, nobody! How many zeros are in this deal? 500,000... not much. But if you help me... 40 % is yours. - No. 50-50. - Okay. If you trick me, I'll pop you. You know me, Mom. Exactly... Fine. It was Condor. Arrives in an hour. Ace, go to Carlos. Once Condor gives me number of the container, you come down with money. Not a minute sooner. Clear? Yes. You stay here. Go and check the parking lot. Carlos, I'll send you Ace. It's Ace. - Already here? - Yes, Ace is already here. - Hey, you got something over there... - Where? There! I am going towards the room. It's Ace. - Now we can talk. - What about delivery? Don't panic, I took care of everything. I crawl back into my old skin. Strange. Exactly how I imagined you. Really? - Were you thinking about me? - Yes, every day. Every morning I would wake up thinking how to find you. Then I wondered. Why Mom split me with my brother? Every birthday I cried like a child. I thought about all the missed moments: First whore, first fart... first robbery. Shit, I'll never forgive her. Everything will be fine, Ace. I'm happy to have you. Now we are together. - Tell me, why were you gone? - Me? Why? To rest. With those two maniac cops... and paranoid Mendes... I couldn't breathe. And I fake my death. I took the car, drove to the morgue, got the corpse. Set everything on fire. And that's it. - Tell me. You slept with my whores? - Me? Are you crazy? - I would never have done it to my brother! - Because I would. - You would? - You fucked them? - No! No! No... not at all. Ok, let's go. Damn bag! Ace, what did you do with Carlos? Brother, it will take time to explain, but... you'll do that once he wakes up. - What? - I'll be brief. This one for taking Ace's spot! This one for banging my whores! And this one for my pleasure. Mendes will finish you. And he thinks that you, are me, but I am already dead. That means you will die twice. Which is rare, brother! Come on, brother. Glad we've met. It's me. Carlos has noticed agents on the second floor. Get them immediately out or we screwed. Teams 5 and 6, leave the second floor. Repeat: disapear! Shit. - Yes? - You ready? Not. - Give me Carlos. - Carlos went to pee. - What's wrong? Problems? - No, everything is fine. Yes, the money is here. - Oh, shit? - What's happening? Nothing. Just looking at all that money makes me dizzy. Thiago, better come here. - Ace, what are you doing here? - Shouldn't you be upstairs? And stop thinking? I leave the bag in the car and go back to Carlos. - No sense of orientation, huh? - The car is outside. - Come, I will show you. - I'd rather be alone. Year after year your brains keep shrinking. I'm not taking it anymore. - I must end it. - Son of a bitch! The bitch is going to make third eye with the bullet and that will be ugly... And you don't move, bastard! Drop the bag! - Mom, I'm your son! - Exactly. I know what you are. Open the bag. - Can I? - Please. Job for 500000 euros... Bastard. I knew you would cheat me. Would you kill those two idiots so we can have calmly talk, like a family? I have the gun, I'm making decisions. And if you even move a little, I'll shoot. For the first and last time, Ace. Where is the money? Even if I tell you, you will not believe me. No. Carlos, kill him. We caught Ace. He wanted to get away with the money. The one who holds Ace is Carlos and he's before my eyes. Ok. Bring him up before Condor arrives. It's a little complicated. Better get down. Let him breathe. Apparently he is right now in the underground parking. Ace? What are you doing over there? This is my twin brother. Bank's employee rat hired by the cops to take you and the Condor. - He is the one who plays with the cops! - Right? Then why money is with you? And the micro-piercing through the nipple? For once I'm telling you the truth! He is lying! Ace is me, fuck! Strip. Remove the shirt. Yes. Do it! Angel, help him! You twin bastards! VADE RETRO SATANA! (Go back, Satan) Bastard escaped! He overtook us all. "He". But who? MIAMI TWO WEEKS LATER Shit. We have codes of Mendes accounts broken. - We can transfer 40 million. - To which accounts? - He will decide. - I've opened four accounts: Luxembourg, Malta, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands. Beautiful bastard you are. Almost like me. You have cheated them all: the cops, Mendes, everyone! You know what he said when I suggested to split money with everybody? Yes, we know. "50 million for two is better!" So, I said it. But when you offered to take a bullet in your hand, then I took you really seriously. - You're tough but still stupid. - That's why we're brothers? You know, we can try again the old game. Forget it, you have no chance. Look what I've got. Whoever picks it up, takes the other half. Come on, brother, you will be humiliated. Well, as you wish. Can you count to three, Luna? Get ready. And one... two... three! COURTASY OF YAFI JAGIELLONIA BKS PANY!
