"December 24, 2006. Italy" You have to give me two million today because you stole from me. If you do not bring it today, it will be your son's best last Christmas ever. You got me? Hey listen up! I don't care what faith you are. We have Mercury, and until I get back my money to buy my missiles, you'll have to wait your turn. You hear me? Do you know what's the most important thing in life? It's dignity. And that phone represents my dignity. It was given to me by this, this... guy here. I don't even like him that much. He says if my dignity was jeopardized, that would be my guardian angel. Don't worry, we're here to save you! Don't come any closer, otherwise I'll cut him up! Behind you. I'm not falling for that. You take me for a fool? Merry Christmas. Thank you! "Chinatown, Italy" Papa! Papa, why aren't you wearing your uniform? Papa! Tonight is Christmas Eve. Here's to you all. - Cheers. - Merry Christmas! (Klingon) Father, how do you know so many great warriors? Hey kid, what are you babbling about? He's dressed like an alien, naturally it's an alien language! (Klingon) Never mind them. (Klingon) Eat up. You know Klingon, too? We're from the same planet. How else would I know it? These four are amazing. That one is Steelskin. I know. He of the impenetrable skin. - This one... - He who cuts to the core, Sureblade. And me? Megafoot, who doesn't always use her feet. Correct? Now, this one's the most impressive, Lin Zaifeng, the head of the four bounty hunters. Sis, what's a bounty hunter? It means they're here to catch papa. Your papa's the best hacker there is. I think if he didn't want to be caught, no one could do it. With just a line to the internet, he once took the profits of many evil men and transferred them to third-world charities. So to a lot of people, your papa is a great hero. I'll protect my papa! I don't want a papa who's a hero! I just want a papa who will always be with us! Papa has always wanted to be like Santa, sharing all good things with everybody. But I neglected my own two children. Now I know that in this world, outside of dignity, there are other things even more important. Papa promises you he'll be an even better papa, an even better Santa. I have a Christmas present for you. - Central Investigation Agency (CIA) US Headquarters - What? So this thing is a prison- that he designed for himself! I've never heard of such a thing. Thanks for the coffee. I know that MI-6 and the Russians are just dying to have him over for a visit. Whoah, whoah, hang on. At least tell me what the hell it's all about. He calls it- "The Hand of God". "CIA Prison 6" And so it was that Mercury spent the next dozen years in a prison he designed, putting everything into creating the torch of peace he'd dreamed of- the "Hand of God". "201 8, Rome, Italy" "CIA HQ Italy" What the hell is this? Sir, our system's been hacked! Hurry up! People, let's go! The firewall! The third firewall has been breached! Stage five firewall down! Notify the assault team! We're down to the last firewall! How much time do we have? At most, thirty minutes. We have to pull the program off the system! Sir, we need to extract the files immediately! Get the ambassador! Go, go, go! Up here. Just this way. Dammit! Sir, look at the card. "Lin Zaifeng" As of right now, I'm bringing the entire agency up to alert level one! Yes, sir! Sir, we've just received a message from the home office. The suspect started up the Hand of God ten minutes ago. Cash accounts, Italian mafia. Have there been any demands? No, sir. And no terrorist group has claimed responsibility. We just know that the one that was stolen is currently active. Can we get a fix on its location? The program can automatically hide itself. Our systems shows over 7000 locations worldwide, with 200 of those locations creating dynamic IP addresses by the minute. It's impossible to track. "1 00 million US dollars is transfering" Have you found Lin Zaifeng, yet? "Shanghai, China, 1 8 Hours later" Mr Lawson, welcome. I'm Emily. Right this way. Ms Wang, this is Peter Lawson. Greetings, Ms Wang. I've been looking forward to meeting you. Enough with the courtesies. I'll cut to it. Can you guess why we're here to see you? When the CIA comes, it's for something that can't see the light of day. For the CIA, it's not can or can't, it's whether or not we want it to. The number one international security specialist, Lin Zaifeng. We believe you're the only one in the world who can find him. "Chaoying, the woman of my dreams! I miss you very much! Lin Zaifeng" "Miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you, miss you. Lin Zaifeng" "Chaoying, you're the love of my life! I miss you so much. Lin Zaifeng" Must you be so sappy? I want to see you. See you at the usual place. "Italy" "Milan" We've already set up the trap. Everything is under control. I don't care how you do it, just get him back here. Yes, sir. Search: Peter Lawson. Welcome. This way, please. We've already set aside your old table. The salt on the table is actually an hallucinogen. The pepper mill has a button on top that can fire electrodes. The glass in your hand... Don't take me for a recruit, okay? The bottom of the glass is a mini stun gun. The guy who just walked past is also one of yours. He even has a gun under a pants leg. Of course, I've also brought in my own people. If I could spot all of this, how could Zaifeng not see them? What's with all the noise? Are you receiving me? We read you. Lin Zaifeng may have arrived. While there's still time, let's set some facial cues. Facial cues? If you notice Lin Zaifeng in your line of sight, face 45 degrees north-west and give a sexy smile. Couldn't you smile a bit sexier? No way, you call that sexy? Can't you add just a little more sexy to it? Hey, give'em a squeeze. Alright, forget it. Now, if you need backup, face 63.5 degrees north-east and casually hike up your dress. Higher... Good job! Should you feel your life is in danger, face forward and show that you're really angry. Even angrier. Can't you give just a little more feeling? How's this for "feeling"? Three seconds slower than I predicted. My, you've slipped! Isn't that thanks to you? Where the hell have you been the last three years? I'm guessing your gun's not loaded. So just one round. Now you're out. Why are you looking for me? I'm not. "Mafia HQ, Italy" Listen, you dared touch my money! Then it's the mafia that won't be letting you off! You thought an assassin from ancient Rome could handle me? I thought I'd gone back in time. You've done such horrible things, you should feel honored that I took your dirty money. I swear that if you're in Italy, I'll make sure you feel the mafia's might! It's simple. If you can work with me, a hundred million US dollars gets returned to you. "CIA HQ Italy" Mr Lin, welcome. Sorry, but your assignment's already complete. What happens now is between Mr Lin and the CIA. You can go. We'll soon have the money wired to your account. You're always so impulsive. Just wait here for me. You are an old friend of ours, Mr Lin. You remember when you captured and brought back Mercury twelve years ago? More accurately, he brought himself in. I heard you were by his side when he died. So you must know the contributions he made to the CIA. Contributions? I'm not so sure he would agree with that choice of word. With the help of the CIA, Mercury accomplished his dream back when he was in Lab Six. He created a global surveillance program that can track down terrorist hiding spots, international money transactions, any type of undercover operations, really. Creating the Hand of God was Mercury's biggest regret because you turned it into a weapon. So, there's nothing more to discuss. Mr Lin, this is not just about you. The United States have seven major secret service departments worldwide. Each of them owns a set of the Hand of God system, and they're all interconnected, of course. Apparently three days ago, one set was stolen from our secret service centre inside the Italian Consulate. The person who stole the Hand of God is a women called Sophie. She used to be a CIA agent in charge of terrorist money flow. I have no idea how she managed to infiltrate our department for two years using a fake ID. Of course, we tried using the Hand of God to find her and found nothing. All we found was a clean pair of glasses and no fingerprints. There's something else. So tell me, why do you think the only other thing that Sophie left behind is a business card with your name on it? You should just go ask her yourself. Of course. That depends on whether or not you are gonna help us find her, doesn't it? Sorry, I'm not interested. I'm sorry, too. Because if you don't help us find her, I'm afraid I can't let you leave. You think you can stop me? Hey! Mr Lin! This is something that will affect the whole world! I hope you can reconsider. There are so many wonderful talents out there. I'm not the only one who can help you find the Hand of God. Go get one of them. Have you considered that in this world, there might be experts other than Lin Zaifeng who can help you find what you're after? Let her in. Experts? I mean me. Why didn't you take this case? Well why did you take it? Quite simply to prove that I'm better than you. Did you consider why they would hand it to you? You wouldn't think the CIA believes my taking it on means you're obligated to help me, do you? You're arrogant. Isn't it possible? So that's it, it finally comes out, right? You've always looked down on me and think I'm a joke, right? Why would I see it like that? Then how do you see it? Like this- They just want to give me the chance to learn alongside the world's greatest security professional. That's more like it. From now on, call me "Boss". Boss? Good boy. This will make it so Lin Zaifeng has no choice but to accept the job. You have even have that lip gloss, "Ecstasy, No. 1 "? The best from the KGB, with the latest nanotech. Colorless, odorless. With just a light kiss, you can track a target up to 24 hours. It's not that I'm using this to kiss you. This is what a highly professional agent does. It's for the job. Yeesh, that's from the 90s. Long out of date. Here, try mine. The latest invention, "Passion, No. 4" A liquid, super-nanotech tracker. Put on your own tongue, it 3D prints onto the target's tongue. Effective for 36 hours. It's that good? It's amazing. Is it done printing? Actually, not quite. The longer the print, the better the result. Alright. Better add to it. Otherwise, the effort might be wasted. It's for you. Hey. How should I address you? Sophie? Notify your boss and have him trace that call! Somebody finds out where that call is coming from, now! Liar. Why are you looking for me? Because you're the head of the four bounty hunters and the one who handed my father to the CIA. Father? Her father? This deal won't work without you. Nicely done, but you can't be as hard to catch as your father. Right now, everyone is after the Hand of God. You've evaded the CIA, but you might not escape others. Considering the danger I'm in, I'll let everyone else share it with me. Within 72 hours, if my demands aren't met, I'll upload the Hand of God's source code. And then everyone can use it however they like. Unless... Unless what? I want a person named Rocky released from CIA's Prison Six. Find out who Rocky is! Yes, sir! I may not know who this Rocky is, but I think someone will tell me soon, right? Since you have the Hand of God, the CIA will accept your terms soon. When Rocky is handed over, you have to come in person. 72 hours. I'll help you keep count. - "72 Hours. The countdown begins" - Much appreciated. He hacked into our top secret Area 51 files one year ago. We managed to track him down and have him arrested. He has been held in Prison Six ever since. Prison Six... In 1 0 hours, the CIA will have him brought to a safe house in Rome. And they suspect Rocky is Sophie's younger brother. Bingo! Did you guess it? Sophie's dragging you into this to avenge her father's capture. Now let's see if she's brave enough to come get him. Let's lend her a hand. Do you have the safe house coordinates? Sure. Search coordinates. "Military Airfield, Italy" "Mafia HQ, Italy" Yes. Check your bank account. A hundred million US dollars. Let's see the true power of the Italian mafia. CIA Safe House What's this? Isn't this the kind you like? I don't eat chocolate. Come on in. That's Rocky. We know that Sophie's not dead. We suspect you participated in faking her death. Would you agree with that? Where might your sister be hiding? Tell us. Now. (Klingon) *&#$^%$ Allow me. Hey, Rocky. May I have a seat? Find out what language that was. Say, that rubber ball is limited edition, from Portugal. I happen to have a collectible one from Spain. You can have it. Tell me where your sister is. (Klingon) *&#$^%$ (Klingon) You've grown. (Klingon) So. It's you again. (Klingon) I'm here to help you. What language are they using? Klingon. (Korean) Drinking skim milk isn't any healthier. And that's why I only drink black coffee. I don't really care, because that's your problem. Cool. But your sister is in trouble. Me? I don't care what she's up to. Don't even want to know. Really? In here, it's plenty comfy. I wouldn't even want out. Thank you. Good morning, madam. How may I help you? I'd like those white chocolates up there. One moment. Stealing those alien files got you 507 years in jail. 507 years. The Monkey King will be free by then. You plan to spend your life inside? You want to play the Pilgrim Monk? I can't sing "Only You". I just want her to come out for a little journey west. A "Journey West"? You're saying my sister is Pigsy? Pigsy's taken. You really don't want out? I want to see my girlfriend. I'll set it up. Oh my god! Get going. They're waiting. Do it! Ah, it's bullet-proof. No need to worry. What're you standing there for? Get out! What about you? Just go! Don't move! You owe me one life. Now you have it back. You owe me another one. Let's go! Well? Go help! When did you cuff me? Just now. Move! Move! Bye-bye. You're letting me go? They're after you, not me. Hey! What's up? Now that's just devious. Let's do it. You guys can't get me. I said you couldn't get me. Alien! I've lost three hours trusting a loser like you. You complain about losing three hours. You know how many men I lost? I'll give you one more chance, but any mistake will have a price to pay. Tell me where they went. Tell me where they went! "Chinatown, Italy" What place is this? It's my safe house. See if we were followed. Clothes are in that room. Go take your pick. So. Been a while since you've been back. How's it feel? This Christmas tree... Sureblade. Megafoot? Megafoot doesn't always use her feet. Hold strong! Steelskin? It's been so long. It seems you're taller than me! Your punches are far too weak! Remember back then, when your father sat here? He was so full of spirit! No. He sat here. Dad was ever the Robin Hood, with countless enemies. Just because he believed the world could be better. My sister chose vengeance against those who mistreated him. While I, I chose my father's dream of protecting world peace. I truly hope that one day she will have more faith in him. Tell me where she is and I'll be able to stop her madness. (Klingon) ^$@%$#%& Such gibberish. What are you saying? Wow, what a temper. Are you the one from three years ago Zaifeng always talked about? The unrivaled beauty with so much talent. He really thinks I'm so beautiful? It is you! The one who bet her heart. The one who lost, through and through- Wang Chaoying! Shut up! Back at you! I want to order! What'll it be? Chitterlings in green peppers. Wood-ear salad. Shrimp dumplings. Sweet-cakes with cream. Hey, she having issues? No, just beautiful regrets. "201 5, 3 years, 45 days earlier" I hear your telepathy is like a supernatural power. Isn't that a bit much? I'd like a rack of lamb, with roast vegetables. He'll have the rib-eye, medium rare. For an appetizer, jumbo shrimp salad, with extra rocket. After the meal, give him a glass of coke, with only 3 cubes. And also a mint chocolate chip ice cream. Well done. Sadly, you missed one thing. Anyone who knows my eating habits could put together my order. It happens that today I thought of something I'd never ordered before. Tequila Sunrise. Some say this cocktail is like a Mexican sunrise, scorching hot. When you entered, the look you had when you saw me, I knew you'd want to order it. You deserve your reputation. The head of the four bounty hunters didn't just ask me here today just to help order a meal. You even knew my drink. How could you not know why invited you here? It's okay, it's okay. I invited you because a fugitive from last year's subway bombing in Spain also happened to be here. Since we both see ourselves as the best in the protection business, let's have a little contest. I love contests. A contest of the world's most important thing, one's own heart. The rules? We date for a month. Safeguard your own heart- And you're the best there is. Don't regret it. If stealing men's hearts was a sin, I'd already have offices in Hell. Then it's settled. "3 years, 29 days earlier" When stealing someone's heart, relying on appearances isn't enough. You must have a strategy. So during a first encounter, you must add a few touches. Then add a few small motions so that he suddenly has a sense of déjà vu, as if in the past, he'd been cared for by someone close. When it all goes naturally and smoothly, it's just a matter of course. Such a series of combined stimuli creates in the other a kind of illusion- "Love at first sight". "3 years, 22 days earlier" Synchronizing of frequencies, matching your rhythm to his as much as possible, including breath, stride, speech, body rhythm, and so on, often facilitated their developing feelings. Stealing his heart wasn't hard at all. What happened next? Even after that? The day the contest was over... "3 years, 1 5 days earlier" From this moment, you are the only one in this world who can find me. Whenever you miss me... I don't need that. Your heart is firmly within my grasp. You're not going anywhere. Only when Zaifeng turned and left that night, did Wang Chaoying realize she'd completely lost. And now that her heart had been stolen, she'd lost her telepathic ability. Who said you could sit here? Wow, fried chitterlings. The peppers are fine, but the rest is too fatty. And who knows if they were even cleaned properly? Here, let me help you with it. Why did you tell them everything about us? Six more beers! And Sichuan chicken! Be sure it's tingly-hot! All because of you, I've lost my sense of telepathy. But I can still faintly sense that Rocky is holding a very big secret. You'd best be careful. Got it, Boss! Hello? There's a woman called Sophie looking for Wang Chaoying. Tell Lin Zaifeng there are only 45 hours left and I have yet to see Rocky. Your brother's a real pain. Hurry over and get him. And do be quick about it. You tell Lin Zaifeng- when he took away my father, it destroyed our family. Inside Prison Six, my father tasted pain and betrayal. Not only do I want to destroy this world, I'll also take away the person most important to him, so that he will feel even greater pain and despair. Your heard it. I just don't get it. How could she use the Hand of God to destroy the world? Could Rocky still be keeping some secret from me? That doesn't matter. What matters most is that Sophie is threatening to take the most important person to you. Look, barring my personal connection, I ask you- Who is most important to you? I think this Sophie's just trying to scare us. So, the person whose life is on the line- Is it me? Something's up! Get Rocky out of here and Chinatown will be safe. Yeah. Give us Rocky! Or we tear this place apart! You have ten seconds. Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Come with me! Don't let him get away! In the cars! After them! Hurry up! Move! Move! It's bullet-proof! Time to look up my girlfriend. You're playing games at a time like this?! I like her and she likes me. Hear that? He likes a sea lion and just says it! That's real love! Not like some people! They're totally crazy for someone, but won't dare say it! Hold on to me! Sir, it's a dormant military sat, aiming an unidentified weapon towards Italy! All set. I told you something's up with this kid. Wait here a minute, it's too sunny out there. One second. You! What the hell did you do in Prison Six, man? You should be asking what I did before I was taken in. So getting in was your plan. If the Hand of God has a Left, then it has a Right. The Left instantly gets a record of anyone's location and activity. No one can hide from it. The Right can backdoor into any of the world's military weapons systems. With both hands connected, nuclear warheads, H-bombs, tactical sats- they're all like drinks in a fridge, grab one whenever you want. So the Right Hand of God is your masterwork? That's a secret only my sister knows. I don't get why you'd write such terrifying software. Aren't you a pacifist? Peace is my intention. Your father created the Hand of God for peace! And now? It's a mess! Man should not be playing God. That's why I hid from my sister. She stole the Left Hand because she wants to take away my Right Hand. You've already evaded her for three years. Do you think that in that time she's changed her hatred for the world? Let me ask you- If my dad was still here, what would he do? You find him. And you bring him in. "Train Station, Milan" What are we doing here? Now that Right Hand has been exposed, we'll have to get ready. Stay and keep an eye out. You still keep all this old stuff? Memories are priceless. Put this on. It doesn't run. That's right. It's a constant reminder that a watch... is just its disguise. You'll find out its real function once you use it. Hey. Are you serious? Give... Oh, it's a picture of us. Like you said, outdated storage. "Nine Lives Bubble Gum" Ready the car. Take him. Hey! I can't get you the Hand of God without him. He's something we want even more. That means our arrangement ends here. (Klingon) #^&$^%& (Klingon) #@&$#@ You want some? It's almost time. Please open the door. He's coming. That gum's good stuff, no? Pretty good. (Klingon) After the bridge, (Klingon) the gum. Don't sell it short. If you find yourself in over your head, it could well save your hide. Damn it! "24 Hours, 20 Minutes Remain" Why are we back here? Precisely because they wouldn't expect it. That makes it safe. Zaifeng hasn't made fried rice in a long time. Each time he does it, it's time for action. He's even adding scallions. This time, it's going to be a big deal. Didn't think you knew how to make fried rice. And I didn't think you'd get into the game. Once your father passed away, I thought my time as a bounty hunter was over. Why is that? Because handing him to the CIA was my biggest regret. Do you want to know where I last saw your father? Ponte Sant'Angelo is a pilgrimage destination. On the right is Saint Peter. The book in his left hand represents the Last Judgment. Across from him with the sword is Saint Paul. He represents expelling the wicked. This is the last place I saw your father. I felt I should bring you here to see it. Once I wrote the century's most perfect hacking program. I'd thought it was a divine tribute. I didn't expect it to help the Devil. The CIA used the Hand of God to track numerous global terrorists, hunting them down in horrifying strikes. Even as they had their greatest intelligence victories in history, they also killed tens of thousands of innocent people. This is all wrong! The Hand of God was not made for killing! Did you hear that? No, no! You're the murderers. Your father refused to cooperate with the CIA. He snuck out of Prison Six, thinking it meant he couldn't be used by them. But the CIA wouldn't let him go. Before they caught back up with him, he came to me and played a little game. Have you ever lost a challenge? No. Then let's have another go. Come on! You scared? What's the challenge? Who can hold their breath the longest. The loser has to give up the most important thing in his life. Sure. But what are you giving up? But before there was an outcome to the wager, your father- already said goodbye in the most painful possible way. And I could only accept a total loss. This is what your father left me, but to this day, I still don't know what it's for. Only my sister would know this key's secret. Him giving it to you means he wants you to find her. Starting from when she took the Hand of God, there were coordinates for each time she made a move. And those follow a specific pattern. She wants to tell me where she is. I can find her. However, the place where she's hiding, unless you're specially equipped, is impossible to enter. EMP ? Yes, an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). We'll ask the CIA for one. Why would they trust you? By exchanging the most important person there is to me. Say no more! I know everything. Let me go! Ever since you gave me half your liver, I became the most important person in your life. Let me go, I beg you! - Let me go! - Move aside! Are livers more important than kidneys? You gave me a kidney! I'm the most important one! Who are you kidding? - Outta the way! - Now you? When it comes down to it, I should be the one going. Last year, I had a uterine problem. What? You even had a hand in that? I just referred her to a doctor. I don't care how many organs he has in you. His heart is in my hands. I am, without a doubt, the most important one to you. Lin Zaifeng! There are not much time left in Sophie's countdown. Do you still want that Hand of God? What do you have up your sleeve now? There's something I want to borrow from the CIA. Once the time is up, I'll give you the Left Hand of God, and also the Right. Intriguing. But- Why should I trust you? Because on collateral, I'm giving you the most important person there is to me. This is our latest model. It can take out all enemy electronics. I hope you make it back alive. So, where is she? I'm handing over the most important person of my life. Look after her. The longer the print, the better the result. Black and White Mantis, you're up. If the three of us don't make it back, Bai Ying Tang is in your hands. Remember- Three joss sticks, morning and night. Also, everyday, one drop of water. Take care. "9 Hours, 28 Minutes Remain" You evil bitch! Let me down! Below is a pool of concentrated waste. Fall in and there'll be nothing left but bones. Mark my words, Zaifeng will come to save me! Apart from deadly nuclear waste, each square meter of this place is rapidly IR-scanned. The floors are set with pressure plates. Laser-guided metal slugs will shred intruders in an instant. To him, all of those are just toys. You're dead meat. What are you looking at? That's not mine. Then whose is it? All units be prepared. The target has found the tracker. We're about 20 kilometers from the target now, sir. Why would Lin Zaifeng, for no reason at all, hand you to the CIA? Because you're like those bubbles down there? Waste material? Or you're his walking tracking device, intentionally letting me capture you, so that he could find this place? In his heart, I am simply the most important person there is to him. Second to none. That so? Then I'll give him a taste of what it's like to lose that most important person. Even Black and White Mantis are here? You want Black or White? In this business, there's no difference between black and white. Well said! Go after your sister! Sis, leave with me. And why should I? It's even better they're here, to bear witness as eight billion people worldwide play Missile Command online. Wouldn't that be fun? Give me the Right Hand of God. Come on, let's help out! Look out! Sis! Stop it! Zaifeng! A watch is just its disguise. You'll find out its real function once you use it. He ruined father, yet you still try to save him? It's not just him I want to save. It's you, too. Save me? My little brother sure is something. Give me the Right Hand of God! Have you forgotten how the world treated him and us? How cruelly? Give me the Right Hand of God! Sis, that's all in the past! Remember when we were kids, the last Christmas we spent together? I just remember that was the last time we had Christmas with our dad! I cannot give you the Hand. Destroying the world wasn't what dad wanted! You are my dearest sister. You're not my enemy. And I am not your enemy. If I choose death, would you change? (Klingon) I love you, sis. It's all your fault! Aren't you the most important one to him? I want you grieving the rest of your life! "I lost". How could I lose? Sir, all units in position! Move in. Yes, sir! Go, go, go! Go, go! Ms Wang, you've helped the world. Starting now, you're certainly the world's top security professional! "Warning". Get out of here! It's gonna blow! Ms Wang, hurry! It's about to explode! Run! Hurry! Go, go, go! Get out of here! "Shanghai" I don't have anything to do with the CIA anymore. Why are you still looking for me? Me? Since when do I have the time to look for you? Don't believe me? I don't quite believe it myself. The CIA already fired me. Now I'm here, selling pizza. I don't get what you're saying. Thank you. My pleasure. Are you here undercover? Don't try to play me. You see who that is? Your boss? He preps the dough here. Ms Wang, we didn't play you. You played us. Men's greed has no limitation. Lin Zaifeng has figured this part of us out well. There simply was no Right Hand of God. Hmm? It was through you that Lin Zaifeng made us believe that there was an upgraded, more powerful version of the Hand of God. But what we received was a virus that Mercury had previously written himself. When that Hand of God terminals were linked together, that false upgrade formatted everything, making it impossible for us to restart the program. What the hell is this?! Cheers! I truly want to thank each of you for helping my father realize his dream of ending the Hand of God! Thank you all! Bottoms up! And that's how he pulled one over on us. It was the worst setback the CIA had had in decades. What's about Lin? We searched every pool. Found nothing. There wasn't even nuclear waste. It was just a vat of paint. After we dried it, we discovered a trap door. Sir, we found a secret door. They must have escaped through that. As a hacker from the new generation, doing something for the legendary Mercury was a true honor. We should thank Zaifeng. He got us all together to screw with the CIA. What a great time. But it was you two young hackers playing as them. That's what made it convincing. "3 Years, 1 1 and a half months earlier" Long time no see. Nine months, twenty-three days isn't that long. Some days take forever. Well, boss? What are the orders this time? Memorize it. "Klingon Dictionary". And wipe your background completely clean. Naturally, a hacker's basic skill. Hey! Prison Six houses a Soviet satellite expert. You have to befriend him. Why? Because he can access a dormant satellite-based electron cannon. You must find a way to get it. To hook the CIA, it can't all be fake props. So that's how you got your Sea Lion "girlfriend". But I had it worse. You spent nine months in Prison Six. I was stuck in Rome, making coffee for two years! - "3 Years, 1 1 months earlier" - What? I have to pretend to be Mercury's daughter? And a mole in the CIA? Staying in that boring place for two years? You have to steal the Hand of God from them. That's the only way this plan can work. That's too easy. I can't do it. Fine, I'll go find the mafia to play with. Every great cast needs strong supporting players. The Mystic Duo- Asia's finest magic troupe. - "1 Year earlier" - You really want the Mystic Duo in your play? Doing it for free isn't a problem. That's on us for owing you one. But do you want us to fight for real or for show? And with us four bounty hunters, how could the CIA not be taken in? But we should really thank Mercury. However good a performance, we still needed the script. Without the virus he'd written, there wouldn't have been a show. "3 Years earlier" This is the virus your father designed to destroy the Hand of God. You are the person my dad trusted most in this world. We leave it all up to you. You are Mercury's children. I hope one day- You will find your father's Promised Land. Thank you. What about Wang Chaoying? Why didn't you ever tell her the truth? That's the way it had to be. It's this plan that forced me to leave her three years ago. By dragging her in this time, there were two things I had to give back to her. Two things? What two? Her glory. Without me, she became the best in the world. What else? Also- Her heart. It was probably Zaifeng's plan to have you find this restaurant. To you, coming here maybe some kind of apology. To us- It was pouring salt on a wound. "Train Station, Milan" Finally here. Hey! I knew you faked your death. Of course I faked it. Otherwise, who would be left to beat? So you admit defeat, right? To answer you, the first time I saw you, I already knew I was thoroughly beaten. What's this for? Time for another application. Hey! Hey, take it easy! Hey! "Directed by Jingle MA"
