I see Mrs. Cole lost her diamonds again. Oh, she'll never miss them. They were insured for $200,000. If she never gets it, she won't have to worry. She's got plenty of money. The coppers say they'll have those guys in 48 hours. Yeah, that's what the coppers say. They was insured for $200,000, who's going to pay that? I don't care, I don't have to pay it. Maybe the insurance company will find the diamonds. It's a cinch the coppers won't find them. That's the third time she's been robbed. Where does she keep that stuff, in a goldfish bowl? I don't know where she keeps it, but the crooks don't have any trouble finding it. Oh, it looks like an inside job. Yeah. There's something shady about those jobs, the diamonds always come back. Yeah, but the crooks are never caught. Well, then somebody must be in with the thieves. Maybe it's the insurance company. The insurance company pays a guy to get them back. Who's the guy? Why don't they arrest him? What do you think about it? I never concern myself with anything that doesn't concern me. That's the guy who always gets the diamonds back. This one calls for $120,000 and this policy for $80,000. $200,000 in all, huh? Yes. Yes, exactly. But of course I'm not as much interested in the insurance as I am in the return of my property. No, no, of course not. Sentiment is more important than money, isn't it? That is, to you. Yes, of course. Very well, Mrs. Cole. I'm quite sure all your gems will be returned. Oh, yes! And so am I. All my friends have told me how wonderful you are, that you just never fail. Never? Well, almost never. Oh, you haven't met Fifi, have you? Isn't she sweet? Fifi dear, this is Mr. Morey. He's going to get us our diamonds back. Thank him, thank him. Say goodbye to the nice man. Eeney, meeney, miney, moe. I'll take this one. Oh. So you're the guy who ran his thumb down my back. Yours truly, Benjamin Battle. Hahsit, babe? Hahsit, yourself. I knew it was you. I know the feel of your fingerprints. Ouch! Never say fingerprints when I'm around. It gives me a sickly feeling. Yeah? I'd have a nasty answer for that if I wasn't working here. What can I do for you? Oh, give me a manicure, but don't rush it. I like you to hold my hands. Too bad I can't work with my gloves on. Well, well, Benny, what's the matter? No see you for long time. Well, they had me downtown for two weeks on a bum rap. Poor kid. They blame you for everything, don't they? You said it, beautiful. The way these coppers treat me, you'd think I was a thief. Yeah. Policemen get some funny ideas sometimes. Don't they, though? And me as honest as the day is long. Yeah, but how about the nights? The nights, too. I'm the soul of honor. Sure you don't mean the heel? Who make all this trouble for you, Benny? They're always on my tail. Every time I turn around I see another bull. Well, if it isn't Daniel Barr, the handsome dick. Getting yourself dolled up? Yeah. There's nothing like spending a half hour in a barbershop, it makes a new man out of you. When did you get out of the can? Thanks to the habeas corpus. Yeah, and that shyster lawyer of yours. I wouldn't talk like that. You might get pinched for slander. Yeah. And don't carry any matches, they're liable to charge you with arson. Hey, Chalkie, get me a pineapple soda. Get a big lump of whipped cream on it and a nice red cherry. Hahsit, babe? How do you like that chair? I like it, especially when I'm tired. Well, there's one upstate looks just like it. You wouldn't care for that one, would you? No, thanks. I'm not that tired. Turn to the right, weasel, turn to the right. Well, I'll see you again. Here you are, honey, $1.90 and don't shortchange me. Okay. Barbershop. Yes, ma'am. Yes, we do. The manicures are all busy now, but I'll send one up in a few minutes. Yes, ma'am. Well, sweetie, next to your mother, who do you love? My sister. I thought you were gonna say me. Yeah, I was, but I changed my mind. Stop kidding, will you? There's something about me you don't like. Now what is it? I couldn't give you a decent answer. I'm a woman of very few words. I can't understand it. Why is it that you and me can't get together? Perhaps it's a strange feeling we have for each other that keeps us apart. Oh, Eve, when you're finished, go to Room 408. Okay. Well, I hear you like that. Mmm-hmm. Hey, this doll don't talk, does it? None of them do. They're all broken. Say mama. There you are. Who do you love best, your mama or your papa? I love my mama and my papa. Hey, smart kid, that. I couldn't trap her. Why don't you buy one? Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, when I have some children of my own, I'll buy a doll. Buying a drink. Can you stand one? I'll say. My throat feels like a total stranger's. Okay, honey. Give me a pineapple soda with a cherry on top. Give me a cherry Coke and put the cherry on the bottom. How'd you like that for a crack? Well, I'm not supposed to be funny, I'm a cop. Hey, did Battle say anything about me after I left? No. If he had, I'd have slapped his face. I hate that guy, and he's been trying to date me up for two years. I've been trying to date him up for life, but crooked politicians won't let me. Well, skip Battle. How about you and me tonight? Oh, yeah. Look, honey, I'm getting around to that. I know I'm supposed to take you to a picture tonight, but it's off. What? The picture? See, some Texas guy got taken for 30 grand, so Daniel Barr and his bloodhounds was elected to make the pinch. Oh, well, just another disappointment. The world's full of them. Full of what? Disappointments. What did you think I meant? Bloodhounds? I don't know, honey. I've got so much on my mind. I gotta go over to Hoboken to see a Jersey cop. Couple of other things I gotta do. Well, so long, toots. Don't take any brass knuckles. If I do, I'll use them on you. Hello, Jack. How's the big columnist? Fine. How's the little chump? What do you mean, chump? Chump for putting your money into that machine. Don't you know they're all phonies? What's phony about them? Look at those prizes. If you're lucky, you can win one of them. Yes, you can win one of them, if you're lucky. But how are you gonna get lucky when they're all fixed? Look at that hole marked 10,000. Not a chance in the world of getting a ball in there. There isn't? Then what am I playing it for? That's what I'd like to know. Why does anyone play them? There are a million of those gags in the United States, averaging $5 apiece. That's $5 million a day, and that ain't hay. Now, how about you giving me some news? How about the news you just gave me? Why don't you give that to the public? People pay five millions a day to play marbles. Children play it for nothing. All marble machines are fixed. Save your nickels and give your money to the Red Cross instead of the double cross. How's that? You know, you ought to be working for me. What do you mean, working for you? I can't be everyplace at one time. I've got several people on my payroll. Any time you want to quit that barbershop, let me know. You're smart. You've got a nimble brain. Thanks for the mistake. You've got a great nose for news. All right, whenever I get ready to stick my nose in other people's business, I'll let you know. Gee, I've got to give a dame in 408 a manicure. Dear little thing, now you have a nice new ribbon on. Don't you let that ribbon get dirty. Oh, you look so pretty, you look perfectly lovely. Oh, Mr. Barr, I'm so glad to see you. Have you got the jewels? Well, not yet, Mrs. Cole. You see, they were only stolen yesterday. Oh, yes, and when do you think you will get them, tomorrow? Well, I can't make any promises, but rest assured we're doing our best. Oh, now, that's awfully nice. Oh, Mr. Barr, have you met my dog? Fifi, this is Mr. Barr. Mr. Barr is a detective. Isn't she sweet? Oh, Mr. Barr, won't you sit down? Yes, of course you will, I know you will. Yes, thanks. Would you? Yes, please do come over here. And I know you'll have some tea, won't you? Won't you? Yes, of course, you will. I know you will. Yes, well, Mrs. Cole, the reason I came up to see you is this. We want you to keep this robbery confidential. I know it was in all the papers and all that, but from now on, keep the facts to yourself. The facts, oh, yes, of course. I wouldn't tell anyone. Good. You know, I don't know what I'd do without her. Well, yes, of course you want some tea, don't you? Oh, the darling little thing, she was so... Oh, Mr. Barr. I'm terribly sorry... Oh, really, you know accidents will happen, won't they? Oh, don't give it a thought, Mrs. Cole. Hilda, come get Mr. Barr's coat and dry it. Yes, now, please, you must take it off... ...because that's going to stain. Oh, Fifi, did you see what I did? I spilled tea all over Mr. Barr's coat. Fifi is a Pekingese. Yes. Well, Mrs. Cole, don't forget what I told you. Keep the facts of this thing to yourself, won't you? Oh, yes, I promise you I won't tell anyone. No one. But of course I've only told it to one person, only Richard Morey, the private detective. I get it. Oh, somebody knocked. Don't you love to hear somebody knock? It's always so intriguing, you never know who it is. It always makes you wonder. Do you wonder? Oh, it's the manicurist. Well, I'll be with you in just one minute. Oh, Greta, Greta. Come and take Fifi out for her walk. Give her a nice long walk, right around Central Park. Oh, let me see now, the manicurist. Oh, no, no. No, I can't have you now. I'm much, much too busy. Suppose you come back at 5:00. Well, you might make it 6:00. Oh, or 7:00. Oh, never mind, you don't need to come at all. Oh, dear me. Now, Mr. Barr, what were we talking about? Oh, what was that noise? What was that awful noise? Oh, yeah, yeah. The noise. What was that noise, anyway? I don't know, I'm sure. Oh, well, perhaps it was the door. Of course it was the door, but who banged it? Now, I don't know. Maybe it was the dog. Yeah, whose dog was that, anyway? Well, that's my dog, but she never bangs doors. Oh, she might have done, dogs are funny that way. I had a dog that banged doors. My dog never bangs doors. I'd never permit my dog to bang doors. Well, maybe it was the maid, Mrs. Cole. It wasn't the maid, my maid never bangs doors. It must have been the manicurist. That's exactly who it was, the manicurist. She's got a dog. Wait, I'll see her about it. Give me that coat. What's the matter, honey? Why the high blood pressure? You can't even trust them with a rubber doll. You're a little vague, dearie. What do you mean? I mean there's no such thing as love. What made you think of that? I go upstairs to manicure a dame in 408 and who do I find as big as life? I give up. Who do you find? Daniel Barr, that flat-footed lubber-headed cop. Calling on the lady in 408? And after I've worshiped the ground he's walked on for five years. And those feet cover plenty of ground. All men are mice. All men are mice. Eve. Eve, one of your customers. Say, are you still going with that plumber in Poughkeepsie? Oh, no. I'm going with a basketball player from Dartmouth. Oh, going in for muscle. I'm ready. Hello, honey. Oh, I suppose you're sore at me. Oh, no, I'm so happy I could scream. Oh, now, honey, the whole thing was a misunderstanding. I didn't misunderstand anything, it's all clear to me. What, you mean that party on the fourth floor? No, I mean a party on any floor. Do you expect me to believe you or what I see with my own eyes? Wait a minute, honey, you got it wrong. It was all in the line of duty. Since when does a cop go to 5:00 tea? Is that in the line of duty? No, it's just a line you're handing me. Who was that red-headed dame? Is that the man from Texas? No, no, no. She lost her jewels. She lost her jewels. She lost her jewels. Is that why the maid took the dog for a walk? Eve, Eve. I'm fired and you want me to leave right away. All right, this is Wednesday. Only three days' pay. Goodbye and good luck. Hey, what was... Main floor. Going up. Aspirin. Yeah, I'm expecting a headache. In fact, I've got one. What's the trouble? I'm one of the army of unemployed. You quit your job? Well, you can call it that, but I was fired. They have nice perfumes here. Yeah, if you can afford them. How much are these? Give me four of them. No, they're all for you. Oh, but you could. No, but you must and you will. How about some candy, too, huh? Here you are. Do you like sweets? One more for you. Please. I'll have to get a truck to carry all these things home. No, you won't. My car is right here at the door. Charge it, will you? An apartment, French maid, your own car and chauffeur. Doesn't it sound good? Too good to be true. It could be true. And all I have to do is manicure your nails? Here's my house. But, Eve, haven't you forgotten something? Yeah, my key, but I'll slip through the transom. But what about the candy and perfume? Oh, give the candy to your chauffeur and use the perfume yourself. Beautiful, isn't it? Yes, about 36 karats. You know her? No. But I will. Say, I cut your friend Battle out today. Cost me $12,000. Don't know if he's worth it. No, he's all right, we can use him. Mmm-hmm. Cortig, if you bought a gift for a girl and she refused to accept it, what would you do? I'd give it to my wife. I haven't a wife. Thank you. Who is it? I'll give you three guesses. I only need one. Take a walk, flatfoot. Honey, don't be stubborn. You got me all wrong. I haven't got you at all. You're back in circulation. Oh, what's the use of being like that? Why don't you listen to reason? I am not in a listening mood. My ears are tired. Well, you're not too tired to hear the truth, are you? The truth's not in you, copper. You'd lie about the weather. I never lie to you. I'm nuts about you, honest I am. You're the only girl in the world for me. I'm so crazy about you I can't see straight. You can't do anything straight. You're crooked all over. Oh, have a heart, will you, honey? The whole thing's just a mistake. Yeah, I know it is, and you made it. Go on back to the dame in 408. That ain't a dame, honest it ain't. What is it, a female impersonator? No. The woman is Mrs. Cole. She lost her jewels, so the Inspector sent me up to talk it over. And what happened? Nothing. We talked it over, and while we were talking it over, she asked me to have a cup of tea. And what did you say? I said ''yes,'' so I had a cup of tea. Strong or weak? Weak. No, I think it was strong. Lemon or cream? Cream, strong cream. Strong cream? I mean weak lemon. Oh, I don't know what I mean. Anyway, here's what happened. We had some tea, she lost her jewels and all we did was talk it over. Now can I come in? No. Go on back and talk it over. Hello, Dan, what are you doing here? Oh, nothing. Just calling on a friend of mine. Say, you look like you're upset. What happened? Oh, nothing. Just looking for a friend, but I guess he moved. Well, say, I still live here. How about you and me, huh? What do you mean? Well, let's go up to my place and have a little talk. Oh, I don't know. I ain't much on conversation. I don't know how to talk. What's the difference? Say, I'll do all the talking. And then again, maybe we won't talk at all. Maybe we'll just sit and look at each other like we used to do. You know... Look at each other? Why, that ain't much fun. Oh, say, you're not like you used to be. Come on, be yourself. Hey, I remember when you used to look at me and like it. Yeah, but that was long ago. Well, what of it? Let's renew acquaintance. Say, remember how I used to sit on your lap and run my hand through your hair? Oh, come on. Don't make yourself so hard to get. Come on, Dan, give me a little kiss, will you? Well... Cute little trick you just pulled. Yeah. You know, when I was a kid I did a ventriloquist act. Which part did you play, the dummy? Oh, you sure can be nasty when you try. Yeah. You can be nasty without trying. Oh, come on, cut it out, let's be friends. I don't want to be friends, I want to be enemies. You'd better come out from under there. You're going to smother yourself to death. I hope I do. I'm tired of living, anyway. Oh, don't be silly. Life is sweet. This is a beautiful world. It would be, except for certain people. Yeah, who are the certain people? Oh, what's the use of getting yourself all steamed up about nothing? You know I don't care about anyone else but you. I'm not so sure about that. Oh, come on, talk sense. Look, why don't you marry me and settle down, huh? We can have a nice little place on Long Island. You know, with a farm. Yeah, we can have some pigs and cows and ducks and chickens. Cows and chickens. And chickens. You said that. Well, look. Wouldn't you like to get up early in the morning and feed the chickens? No. Now go on home. I want to get some sleep. Well, you got plenty of time to sleep tomorrow. You got no job to go to. Oh, no? No, it's gonna be a long time before you get another one, too. Well, you can't get rolled off for trying. Wait a minute, will you, honey? Oh, I wish you were a man. Same to you. Give me Beekman 3-0-0-0-5. That's a newspaper. Clever detective. Hello, Jack Sully speaking. Hello, Jack, this is Eve Fallon. You said I had a nose for news. I know I did. What about it? I'm ready to start sniffing. How about that job you promised me? How about the barbershop? You gonna quit? I quit already. I got tired of meeting cops and crooks. They get in your hair. Okay. Be at my office at 10:00 tomorrow morning. You're on the payroll now. Thanks, Jack, I'll see you at 10:00. Well, Mr. Daniel Barr, I go to work for Mr. Jack Sully of the Daily Bulletin tomorrow morning, and I expect to be editor in no time at all. If you happen to be around my way, come up and see me sometime. Oh, hello, Jack. What are you doing here? Just waiting for a friend. Did you get rid of that big bozo? No. No. He's still out there. Want me to throw him out? Why bother? Why bother? Come on, give me a little kiss. Oh, you have beautiful hair. I love to run my hand through it. Come on, give me another little kiss. How are you, boys? Oh, say, I'll tell you why I asked you down here. I don't know who's got that stuff, but you do. I know who's got the stuff, but I don't know what they've got. Well, here's the list. When you pay those gentlemen, you'll know exactly what to expect in return. Cigarette? Yeah, but suppose they won't take what you offer them? They'll take it. If they do business with a fence, it'll take them a month to get paid. I pay off at once, strictly cash. I'm always glad to contribute to charity. Thanks. How do you do, Mrs. Cole? Really? Do you know you forgot to return my cigarette case? Did I? Well, I'm terribly sorry. Oh, here it is. You know, I'm always taking things that don't belong to me. Oh, Mr. Morey, and you a detective. Fifi, Fifi, you remember Mr. Morey. How is Fifi, Mrs. Cole? Well, I think she's quite all right, but her eyesight's failing. Poor little Fifi. Won't she look horrible in glasses? That's probably why she didn't recognize me this morning. Maybe so. Well, this looks like the place. Yeah. There they are, there. Well, have you got those stones with you? You don't think I'm gonna carry that much stuff around with me, do you? Well, I don't know. Anyhow, let's get down to business. What do you want for them? Seventy grand. What are you trying to do, scare those pigeons here? I was told to give you 40. They were insured for 200. What happens to the other 160? Well, now you're asking questions. Yeah, and we'd like to get some answers. Hahsit, babe? Our price is 40, and that's what you're gonna get. We'll get what we want and not a penny less. Hey, what are you trying to do, pick an argument? No, are you? Then here it is. Why isn't something done about the baby killers in the park? How long do we have to wait before they're apprehended? What's the matter with the cops? What's the matter with the Chief? What's the matter with the Mayor? Why don't they clean up the city? What we want is action! Protect our women and children! Take every known gunman and throw him into jail and keep him there, that's where they belong! That's great. That's the kind of stuff we want in the paper. How long you been here? A couple of days? You should have been here years ago. You know how to write. What's your salary? Mr. Sully pays me 30 bucks a week. Thirty bucks? Make it $35. $40. No, you better make it $50. Hello, what do you want? You know what I want, honey. I want you. Oh, quit kidding, will you? Forget I'm a cop for a little while. Treat me like a human being. I'll treat you like a human being. But don't let it go to your head. Hey, if anything goes to my head, it won't be that. Listen. What are you gonna do, tell me about those cows and pigs and chickens again? Oh, not now. Look, I got an assignment today that will make me the biggest cop in New York. What for, taking that dog for a walk? Listen, I got a big job on my hands. Yeah, well, what is it? I'm all ears. Well, you know those guys that killed the baby in the park? No, do you? The Inspector picked me to catch them. And Sherlock Barr is gonna catch them. You can say it twice. I got a witness already. I'm holding her downtown. And another thing. I found a list of the missing jewels right near where the baby was killed. That means that both jobs were done by the same mob, don't it? Gee, that's great. What's the matter, got a date for tea? Handsome Dan Barr gets his biggest assignment. The capture of the baby-killers. Inspector Keilly picked the right man. Barr already has one witness to the shooting. Hey. What's the rush? Where are you going? You'll find this evening's column on the record. I'll be back later with bigger and better news. Ain't a woman got no rights? Here they are holding me as a material witness and I don't know nothing about nothing. I don't know what you know, but whatever you know, you ought to tell it to the cops. Oh, the cops. I hate every one of them. Oh, one of them is all right. Gee, he was handsome. His name is Dan. Yeah? What did he have to say? Oh, strictly business. He asked me what happened, and I says nothing. I was walking along in the park when a fresh guy says, ''Hahsit, babe?'' What'd the fresh guy say? Nothing. He just says, ''Hahsit, babe?'' ''Hahsit, babe''? He was one of them oily guys, but I didn't say nothing to him. I just smiled and walked away. And then, all of a sudden, the baby was shot. But I didn't see it. Honest, I didn't. Hahsit, babe? Yeah, say, listen, why don't they let me out of here? I'm a citizen. Can't you do nothing for me? Listen, honey, I'll get you out of here, but you gotta make me a promise. Yeah, sure. I'll do anything. Just get me out of here. All right. Listen to this. If anybody asks you any questions, don't answer them. Say nothing. Nothing at all? Gee, that's kind of hard. Nothing at all. Not even, ''Hahsit, babe?'' If I showed you a picture of that guy that flirted with you, would you know him? Oh, sure, I'd know that pan anywhere. That's all I want to know. You got the wrong idea, Cortig. I told you a million times to always take the easy way out. Well, I always try to. When a guy puts you on a spot where you gotta push him, what are you gonna do? Do what I told you to do, talk him out of it. Yeah, that's all right for you, but me, I got a temper. When a mug gets me sore, I gotta blast. Sure, you gotta blast and I have to square the beef. Every time you bump somebody off, it costs me a lot of money. Do me a favor, will you, Russ, and stop killing people. Oh, quit worrying about it, will you? Nobody saw me do it. There wasn't anybody around, not even a blind man. Whoa, wait a minute. Get a load of this. ''Crime marches on. A baby in Central Park was killed by two unknown assailants.'' Assailants. ''And the killers have not yet been taken into custody.'' Custody. Gee, that's a funny word, ain't it? ''The killers have not yet been taken into...'' Custody. ''But are under surveillance.'' Yeah, that's what it is. And here's the rest of it. ''There was only one eyewitness,'' ''and the name is withheld.'' What kind of a name is that? ''Whose name is withheld'' ''and she is being held in-communi-cado.'' Incommunicado. I don't care how you pronounce it, but they got a dame who saw us do it. And that's all because you've got a temper, Mr. Cortig. Well, now what are we going to do with the girl? Oh, don't worry about the girl. Look, as soon as they spring her, we'll scare her out of town and if she won't scare, we'll dust her off. Yeah, hey that's it, we'll massacre her. Massacre. Oh, you and your phony English. Sixty cents. Keep the change. Say, ain't you the gal that got your name in the paper? Yeah, sure. How did you know? Did somebody point me out? Yeah, everybody knows it's you. You're getting famous. Quit it, you're ribbing me. No, he ain't. First thing you know, you'll be signing your autograph. Just like a movie star. Oh, get those cigarettes out of that gray coat, will you, toots? Yeah, sure. Hey, what're you trying to do, scare somebody to death? If a certain lady don't keep her mouth shut, we might have to kill her to death. Well, if you're hinting at me and what I said to the cops, well, you got me all wrong. I never told them nothing. Don't forget it, honey, the coppers never know nothing unless somebody tells them something. But I never told them a thing, honest I didn't. Take a tip from me, sister, and keep your mouth shut, or somebody's liable to find your hat floating down the river. You know what I mean? Hello, Betty. Hello. Hello, Grace. Hiya, Myrtle. Remember me? Well, if it isn't the big newspaperwoman. What are you doing here? A murderer always returns to the scene of his crime. I'm going to get a haircut. Say, listen. Are you still stuck on that big, handsome cop? With all my heart. And he's going to be in here in a few minutes. See you later. How long you gonna be, Joe? I want a haircut. Five minutes. Booth one. I always cut mine. Oh, cut yourself a piece of throat. Hahsit, babe? Well, look who's here. Once a slave, now a customer. Don't you look swell. Nothing swell. I got the whole outfit in the basement. $14 for the coat and dress and $3.75 for the hat. $17.75! Hello, Myrtle. Eve around? Yeah. You'll find her in a booth. Hey, you got me in a fine spot. ''Handsome Dan Barr will capture the baby killers in 24 hours.'' Well, it's just what you're going to do. How do I know, honey? Yeah, since when are you a cop? I'm not, but I've got a hunch. Oh, hunches don't mean nothing. You gotta be sure. All right. How's this? I had a talk with that waitress yesterday and showed her Benny's picture. And she absolutely put the finger on him. How's that for a hunch? Hunch? It'll make me a captain. Yeah, and me an Elk. Benny Battle, huh? Yeah, you'll find him in the first chair eating a pineapple soda with a cherry on top. Hello, Dan. Nice day, ain't it? Yeah, and you better take a good look at it. You ain't going to see it much. What do you mean? We want you downtown to answer a few questions. Get Mr. Battle's hat and coat, Eddie. What, again? Never mind that stuff, Joe. He don't need to smell so nice where he's going. Gee, can't a guy even get his hair combed? No. The Captain don't care how you look. This is a fine country, this is. They never let you alone. No. They're always picking on you. Hahsit, babe? Come on. There's no jail strong enough to hold that guy. You said it, he'll get out. How? That ain't it, they fix the jury. The politicians. What have the politicians got to do with it? They're in with the racket. Sure. They'll have him out in 48 hours. You mean that he'll be free? Yeah! The home of the brave and the land of the free. Is that the man you saw? No, I never seen him before. Do you know him? Go on. How about this guy? No. I never seen him before. Better take a good look at him. Well, I am. I don't know him. Are you sure? Go on, take another good look at him. I am looking at him. I never seen him before in my life. What are you lying for? You know you did. I'm not! I'm not! I've never seen this guy before in my life. Honest, I didn't. All right. Go on. Somebody got to this dame. He didn't show me the right guy. She's lying. She won't put the finger on him. Why not? How about those pictures I showed you yesterday? You picked one out, didn't you, and said it was the guy who flirted with you in the park. Well, I know I did, but I made a mistake. What makes you think you're mistaken? You were sure enough yesterday. I know I was, but I guess I was wrong. You're lying, Bessie. You know you are. No, I'm not. I'm not lying. Why should I lie? I ain't got nothing to lie about. I didn't do nothing. Oh, don't cry, honey. Nothing's gonna happen to you. Run along home. Now what happens? Oh, somebody threw a scare into that dame. Now I'm on the spot again. What's the next step? That guy'll be out of here in less than no time and we'll be back where we started. Keep your hands off me or somebody'll get a bust in the nose around here. What's the matter? Can't a guy even talk to his own lawyer? No. Hey, what are you going to do, throw him in there? You can't do that! Say, where do you get that stuff? That man's got constitutional rights. He is innocent and you've got no right to lock him up. I'll see somebody about this. All right, see me. I'm the guy that brought him here. Yeah, you. You brought him here. Why don't you get the right man before you lock him up? You can't throw people in jail for no reason at all. Oh, shut up. You're lucky you're not in there yourself, I'd like to get something on you. You can't talk to me like that. I'm a lawyer! That's what you think. Now get out of here! I'll get even with you for this. I'll have you transferred to Brooklyn. I'll go to the Chief. I'll go to the Mayor. I'll go to the Governor! Oh, go to... Get out of here. There you are. How would you like to go to Brooklyn every day to see your boyfriend? That's the wrong end of the bridge. Yeah. We'll be up against it if we can't get that dame to talk. How about Battle? Isn't there any chance of breaking him down? No, he's just as scared as she is. He's afraid of what those crooks might do to him. How much longer can you hold him? A few hours. He'll get that shyster lawyer of his down here with a writ and be on the street again. That's fine. That means that every baby in New York will have to take his sunshine indoors. Yeah. But what can I do about it, honey? I'm only a cop. You and I know that Benny drove that car. We know that he knows who killed the kid. But what good is it gonna do us? Sometime between now and midnight he'll be on the street. I can put him in, but I can't keep him in. Want a drink, honey? I've got an idea. I think I can make him talk. Say, if you can wring a confession out of that guy, you're a miracle man. A what? That's better. Hello? Yes. Yeah, this is Kelton. Hello, boss. Here's a scoop. Benny Battle just confessed and named the actual baby killer. You better headline it. No. Nobody knows anything about it but me. Attagirl, Eve. You're the best reporter in town. There you are. What did I tell you? Habeas corpus. You'd better let Battle out of here. Congratulations, Dan. If that don't get your promotion, kid, nothing will. What do you mean? ''Benny Battle names baby killers.'' Say, what did you do, print this yourself? Not me. I'm still a cop. Newspapers do funny things. It's all Greek to me. Where am I going now? They told me to turn you loose. Makes no difference to me whether you're in or out, but I'd rather see you in. Now, you don't mean that. You know you don't. You got such a kind face. Yes, you got a kind face, too. It's the kind I don't like. Okay. I hope you'll never have to see it again. So do I. But something tells me I will. Give me my stuff. There you are. Sign there. How do you like our hotel? Fine joint this is, crummy, filthy dump like this. Fine way to treat a human being, too. Why, I wouldn't let a dog sleep in a place like this. He's liable to catch pneumonia. You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Hotel. But you'll never see me here again. No, sir, never again. Oh, now, that don't look like a good picture of Benny, does it? Well, a little bit, it does. I guess it's an old picture. Yeah, when did you have that picture made, Benny? A little publicity for you. Well, I don't want no publicity. And you guys know that I didn't do any squealing. Oh, what are you worrying about? People don't believe all they read in the newspapers. Well, they might. What kind of a paper is this, anyway? English. But where did they get this story about making me a stool pigeon? Well, you know how newspapers are. They say anything. Freedom of the press. Yeah. Freedom. Too much freedom. Yeah, just like you. Oh, yeah? Well, here goes for a little freedom. Wait a minute. That's mine. Well, well. What's the matter, Benny? Afraid to go out? No. I ain't afraid. Well, what's keeping you? Don't let them, Dan. They're trying to knock me off! What are you talking about? Oh, yeah? Who? But somebody's trying to kill me. I want protection. That's what the cops are for, ain't they? Lock me up, please. Put me where I'll be safe. Oh, you don't want me to lock you up here. You're liable to get pneumonia. I don't care what I get. It's better than being knocked off. Put me where I'll be safe. You got to lock me up. You'd better get out. This place ain't fit for a dog! I don't care nothing about that. I want to be safe. All right, who pegged the shots at you, do you know? No. No, I don't know. But I don't wanna get killed. All right, I'll tell you what I'll do. You squeal, and I'll let you stay. If you don't, I'll kick you out in the street. Squeal? But I've never squealed in my life! All right, Tom. Throw him out. No, no. I want to go in here. Don't throw me out there. I want to go in here. No, no, I won't squeal! Don't throw me out. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I'll tell! I'll squeal! I'll squeal! I said that I'll squeal! All right, come on in. He asked me to go for a ride, and I drove the car. I didn't know where we was going. And then when we got there, at the park, Cortig went in and met a couple of guys. What was he going to meet them for? Well, I don't know. I don't know. All right, Lee. Throw him out. They were talking about the diamonds that were stolen, and then I heard a couple of shots and Cortig come running out and away we went. Yeah, and away you go. Lock him up. Come on. Oh, hello, Eve. Hello, Dan. I just saw them dragging Benny down the hall. Where are they taking him? And is he glad. Some of his playmates took a few shots at him, so now he doesn't care much for the great outdoors. Who did the shooting? I don't know, but whoever it was did us a good turn. That is the best break I've had all year. Did he name the killers? Only one. Russ Cortig. I'm going out to get him now. And when I nail him, you'll be the first one to hear the news. I want you to get a scoop for that beloved newspaper. Thanks. I'll ask for a raise. That is, if I'm not fired. Oh, they won't fire you, honey. They might, I get my news too fast. That's too deep for me. It was too deep for them. You see, I reported my news before it happened. Wait a minute. You mean that headline about ''Benny Battle names baby killers''? Say, you know I thought there was something funny about that because he didn't confess until after his mob tried to bump him off. That wasn't his mob. Want to buy a gun? Wait, that's mine. That's right. Thanks for letting me use it. Honey, you should have been a detective. Won't Charlie Chan be mad when he hears about me? Yeah. Dan, that Mrs. Cole is on the wire again. It's the fifth time she's called today. Why, the dame's crazy about you. No, no, strictly business. Yeah? What kind of business? There you are. Now you see how it is, honey? The dame won't let me alone. Yeah, you mean you won't let her alone. Oh, listen. You got it all wrong. I don't care anything about her. No, I suppose it's her dog you're stuck on. Oh, forget it, will you? Forget about her and forget about the dog. Well, maybe it's the maid. Why don't you go and have a cup of tea and take off your coat and make yourself at home? All right, now, look. Look, I don't care anything about her. I don't care anything about the maid, and I don't care anything about the dog. Yeah? Well, I don't care anything about you. Geraniums can be transplanted by the cutting. The geranium is a hardy flower and will withstand the severest of weather, except extreme frost. They grow either in the shade or in the sun. There is a variety of colors amongst geraniums, but the red and white predominate. Now, my dear botanists, this is Oliver Tidmarsh, and I'll be back tomorrow afternoon and tell you about the rarest of all flowers, the beautiful orchid. And now we bring you the latest news topics. Hello, hello, hello! How do you do, everybody? Here are the latest news flashes. Heavy rains have impeded the Italian army and they've made little progress into the interior of Ethiopia. Flash! Benny Battle, a well-known police character, has confessed and he has named the killer of the baby in Central Park. The police promise to make an arrest within 24 hours. Cortig not there anymore? Thank you. - Changed his address? - Thank you. You don't know where he moved to? Thank you. Cortig checked out last night? Thank you. Afraid I can't give you any information. All right. Thanks, boys. I'll get it myself. Who's there? Where you going? I'm gonna get out of town. This place is getting too hot for me. What's the matter, are you crazy? You know I always put the fix in. Yeah, I got a hunch you ain't gonna put the fix on this. Benny turned rat. He told the coppers everything. What if he did? That's nothing to worry about. All we need is an alibi. Alibi. Sure. Yeah. That's all we need, it's an alibi. Let's see, what'll it be? Who's there? It's the law, open up. All right, just a minute. I'll open it. Come on, let's break it in. Come on. So this is where you live. What's the matter? You been looking for me? Yeah, in every hotel in town. What are you doing? Throwing a party? All by myself. I like to be alone. Alone, eh? Well, maybe it's a good idea. The less people know about you, the less they can say. Do you mind if I look around? No, go ahead, help yourself. Well, well, what's this? The bathroom? I never take a room without a bath. I know one room you'll have without a bath. Without flowers, too. Nice view you got here, Central Park. Yeah, I can see them skating in the winter. You won't be here this winter. Nice trees. Just beginning to leave. So are you, come on. Hey, what are you trying to do? Kill them lilies? There'll be plenty left for your funeral. Come on. All right, Dan, there's what I found on the glass. Now all you've got to do is to find the guy that belongs to that. Yeah, that's all. Here, check this. I'll be back for it later. Hiya, Captain. Captain? Thanks for the promotion. Grab yourself a chair, honey. Oh, I'm too excited to sit down. Yeah? What are you excited about? About Cortig's trial. In a few hours he'll be on his way to Sing Sing. Oh, I can see the headlines now. ''Russ Cortig convicted of baby killing.'' ''Detective Daniel Barr promoted to Captain.'' So you don't mind if I call you Captain now, do you? What do you say, Captain? Say, why don't you answer me? You've got about as much enthusiasm as a jellyfish. Don't you want to be a captain? Sure I do, but I'm not thinking about that now. What are you thinking about? I'm not a mind reader. Well, look. Here's the fingerprint we found on that drinking glass. Whose is it? Well, it belongs to a guy with a scar on his thumb. Well, who is he? Well, how're you gonna find out? I don't know, but when I do, I think I've got the man I want. What makes you think so? Hunches are no good. You got to be sure. On May 12th, at 2:00 in the afternoon, a little child was killed by an assassin. The man accused of that crime is sitting right there. On May the 12th, I saw Russ Cortig in Philadelphia at 2:00 in the afternoon. Gentlemen, it is quite evident that the alibi has been manufactured. I object, Your Honor. It is for the jury to decide whether this witness is telling the truth or not. Proceed. I intend to prove that the prisoner was not in Philadelphia on the day of the shooting. I was with Russ Cortig in Central Park the day he killed the baby. Did you see him fire the shot? Well, it was this way... Answer yes or no! Your Honor, I object. Objection overruled. Did you see Russ Cortig fire the shot? Answer yes or no. No. Gentlemen of the jury, I ask you not to be misled by the cheap dramatics of an ambitious prosecutor. The chief witness against the defendant is a convict with a record extending over a period of 10 years. It is evident that this witness has been coached by the police. Therefore, I beg of you, gentlemen, to find the prisoner not guilty. Gentlemen of the jury, you see before you a monster who has committed the unspeakable crime, a wanton killer who has robbed a mother of her dearest possession, her baby. Gentlemen of the jury, it is your sacred duty to put this man where he belongs, in the electric chair. He has killed an innocent child and I demand the extreme penalty, death. Gentlemen of the jury, you will consider carefully the evidence that has been submitted in this case. If you are firmly convinced that this man is guilty, find him so. On the other hand, if there is the slightest doubt in your minds as to the prisoner's guilt, you must give him the benefit of that doubt and find him not guilty. We, the jury, find the defendant not guilty. Not guilty? Well, what do you think of that? I never knew a courtroom could be so elevating. You certainly meet some charming people. So truthful, so honorable. It's an insult to every man, woman and child in the city. There you are, Detective Sergeant Barr. How do you feel now? How do you think that poor woman feels? I know it, honey. But I can't help it. I did the best I could. When you were in the witness chair, why didn't you stand up and scream? That's what I'd have done. All you can do is answer questions. The kind of questions they ask, they get just the kind of answers they want. Yeah, but what can I do about it? You think I was personally responsible. I can't run the courtroom, honey. It's none of my business. Why didn't you tell them how long you've known Cortig, how rotten he is? If you can't send a man away for murder, what does he have to do? I don't know, but I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna quit. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm sick of the whole rotten business. Russ, that's the first time I've heard you laugh in months. Keep laughing, it's good for you. You're not looking very well. Why don't you take a run down to the seashore and give yourself a rest? Yeah, thanks for the tip. I think I will. Oh, and you remember when that guy... When he asked Benny... Now, don't you worry about that, old man, we know he's one of the men who robbed the bank and we'll send him up the river for a long stretch. Now this is one case he'll never beat. Yeah, goodbye. You know, I've got a clerk out there who announces my visitors. I couldn't wait that long. I was afraid I might forget what I want to say. Well, say it and get it off your chest. I want to get this off my chest first. What's my resignation. Don't you like the way we run this department? No, I got nothing against the department. This city's got the finest police force in the world. But what good is it if they can't enforce the law? What law? The more serious the crime, the easier it is to beat. They never put anyone in jail around this town except beggars and peddlers. When a criminal with a record as long as your arm kills an innocent baby, what happens? Nothing. Young man, you're right. Nobody knows it better than I, but I'm just as helpless as you are. Well, your stomach's stronger than mine. When they turned Cortig out of that courtroom today, it made me sick all over. Just like it did every mother and father in New York. I know just how you feel about it. When I was your age, I thought every criminal was in prison, but it didn't take me long to find out that being a cop meant nothing more than having a job. Yeah, and that's all it is, a job. Well, it's a job I don't want. They paid me to protect life and property, but they wouldn't let me earn my salary. Now I'm going out to work for nothing. What are you going to do? Yeah, you see, when I was an officer of the law, I couldn't lay my hands on him. Now I'm a private citizen, I can kick him all over New York. You can't expect me to print this. Cortig was acquitted and that ends it. What if he was acquitted? That doesn't make him innocent. He's innocent so far as the court is concerned. That washes it up. All right. It washes me up, too. If I can't print the truth, I don't want to print anything. The truth? My dear girl, we print what we think is the truth. If it isn't, well, we can't help it. You're just like everybody else in this town. They don't care whether a man is innocent or guilty. Nobody cares about anything or anybody. My dear Miss Fallon, I'm an editor, not a reformer. I've got a job, and what's more, I'm gonna keep it. All right, you keep your job and keep mine, too. Now, wait. Wait! You wait, you look like a waiter, anyway. Come in, come in, come in. Come in, come in, come in, come in. Oh, hello, come in. What're you talking about? I am in. Don't stand there looking at me. Come on, help me pack. Where are you going? I haven't made up my mind. Where? I just told you I don't know where I'm going. Well, when do you leave? Well, why can't you take me along? That's what I'm asking you. Say, who's going, you or me? I don't know. I'm not going, you are. What time does your train leave? How do I know I'm going by train? I might be going by boat. What kind of a boat? Come on, help me with this. I can't open it. What's the matter with it? Is it stuck? Wait a minute, I'll do it. Go on, move over. Why don't you help me with this thing? Can't you see that I can't get it open? You take that side and I'll take this. Well, there's nothing in it. I know. What did you have me open it for? Oh, that's the worst of having a woman help you pack. It's a man's job. Besides, you shouldn't have come over here until I got back, anyway. Got back from where? You haven't told me where you're going yet. How can I tell you where I'm going when I don't know where? Well, wherever you're going, here's a sock you left and it's got a hole in it. All right, stay here and darn it. Hey, Dan, you forgot your hat. Dan you forgot something. Yeah, yeah. My hat. Oh, I know. Come on, honey... Now will you marry me? Okay. While I'm away, I'll buy you that little farm I was telling you about. You know, with the pigs and cows and chickens and ducks. No boarders? How about the dame in 408? Take care of yourself, honey. That's a pretty tough guy you're going after. So am I. See you soon. Danny, telephone! Hello. Is Danny Barr there? Who is this? This is Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Chesley Cole. Well, this is Mrs. Barr. Mrs. Chiseler Barr. Hey, Dan! Mrs. Cole wants you to come over and have some tea. I don't want any tea. Yeah, well, I don't want any farm! I wonder if there was any scandal connected with this. What do you think? Was he asked to resign? He's a hardheaded guy. I'll bet he quit because Cortig wasn't convicted. You can't blame him. There's one guy that's on the level. He was a chump to quit. He ought to know by now you can't get a conviction in this town. Here's a card Dan sent from Trenton. This one's from Philadelphia. And here's one from Atlantic City. Where does he go from there? Hope he doesn't run out of railroad fare. Gee, I miss him. I feel as if everything had gone out of my life. I hope he's lonesome. How can you be lonesome in Atlantic City? Honey, when you're in love, you can be lonesome anywhere. This is the biggest city in the world, and I'm lonesome. Mmm-hmm. Well, don't worry about him. He's having a lot of fun. I bet he's swimming all the time. I don't believe it. I bet he's thinking of me. Well, can't he be swimming and thinking of you at the same time? Yes, but I bet he's lonesome. 50,000 dames in bathing suits and you think he's lonesome. Honey, you're still a peasant. Eve, one of your customers. I'll catch it. All right. Bye-bye. Why, Miss Fallon. How is the big newspaperwoman? That's out. I'm back where I started. Why so glum? Oh, everything's gone haywire. Want your nails short? Well, not too short. I see where Dan has resigned from the force. Yes, he did. Oh, about that Cortig case. Wasn't that the most terrible thing? Everyone knows he's guilty and off he goes, Scot-free. Is that why Dan resigned? Sure. He was all burned up because he couldn't get a conviction, but wait till he gets his hands on Cortig. What's he going to do, make it a personal issue? Yeah, he thinks he can do better without his badge. It's man-to-man now. He'll make him talk. Let me have that phone, will you? Will you excuse me? I have a call to make. Hello, get me Locust 3-6-7-2. Yes, that's Philadelphia. No, thank you, I'll hold the wire. So Dan's going to take it into his own hands, eh? That's very interesting, very interesting. I wonder if he'll ever catch up with Cortig. Leave it to Dan. Hello, who do you want? Hello, is that Mr. Patterson? Yeah, this is Patterson. What's new? Mr. Patterson, this is Mr. Morey speaking. Yes. I'm quite interested in that... In that piece of Chippendale. And that Gainsborough painting, too. That is, if the price is right. Stop stalling. You know the price. No. I tell you what you'd better do. You come over and see me right away. Oh, yes, I'm interested. No, I suggest you take a plane. Yeah. It's faster that way. Yeah, okay. All right. What were you saying? Oh, nothing. I was just saying how mad Dan was at Cortig. He thinks they should've given him the chair. Really? He doesn't deserve a chair. They ought to fry him standing up. What are we gonna do, fly over? Yeah, you ain't afraid, are you? I ain't stuck on them airplanes. They're too dangerous. Go on. They're safe as they can be. They'd be a lot safer if you could keep one foot on the ground. There's nothing to worry about. They give you a parachute. Yeah, but suppose it don't open? It's gotta open, it's guaranteed. That ain't gonna make it open. I might have to jump 10,000 feet, and if the parachute don't work, what good's the guarantee? What good is it? If the parachute don't work, they gotta give you a second parachute. You get it? Yeah, I get it. I get everything but the second parachute. What you been doing? Working on Mr. Morey? Say, he's fascinating, ain't he? Mmm-hmm. Kind of mysterious, don't you think? And handsome, too. Handsome, yeah. You know, he's the kind of a guy that you can't figure out. He's... He's different. Of course, he's not my type. I like a fellow like you've got. Gee, you're lucky to have a fellow like Dan. A scar on his thumb. Wait here. I want you to see this. Notice the touch in that one, and the coloring. It's by Rubens. Rubens? Say, is that the same guy that's got the restaurant on Broadway? No, no relation. Now the one next to it is a Velázquez. Superb, isn't it? I'm getting sick of this. Yeah. The whole of this is superb, but what are we here for? You know, there's nothing like strolling around an art museum when you're talking business. Now, this one over here is a Rembrandt. It's what they call a portrait. Rembrandt was famous for his portraits. You say Cortig offered you 40 for those diamonds? That's right, and we want 70. Say, that dame's got beautiful eyes. Uh-huh. That's what made Rembrandt famous. Cortig was to have made $30,000 on that deal, but if he were eliminated, you fellows would get the entire 70. That guy Rembrandt, he's dead, ain't he? Oh, yes. He's been dead for years. I said, if Cortig were eliminated, you fellows would get the entire 70. Consider Cortig eliminated. Hello, Mr. Martin. Why, Miss Fallon, what are you doing here? I'm looking for Dan. Have you seen him? Not since he quit the force, the big simp. If he quit the force, he had a good reason, and he's not a big simp. Oh, isn't he? You just hate him, don't you? Now, you needn't tell me. Actions speak louder than words. Don't worry, he'll turn up and you'll be the first one to know it. I might be the last one to care. Oh, isn't that awful? I'll bet you never want to see him again. I don't. I just want to know that he's safe. Safe? That guy could fight his way out of a den of lions. Of course, he might have a little trouble with a wildcat. Now don't go away mad. I won't, if you'll do me a favor. Why, of course I will. What is it? There's a fingerprint on this. Will you photograph it for me? Sure I will. And I'll tell Dan you never want to see him again. You better not. What are the rates here? Why, it all depends on who you are and what you got. Here, hold this a second, will you, till I get my keys out? You know, I like keys. They get you in and out of places. Make yourselves at home. Well, how do you like the joint? Not bad, eh? You know, I just came back from Atlantic City. Played some swell golf down there, broke a 98. Thanks. You boys will pardon me while I put these flowers in water, won't you? You know, flowers are funny that way. You got to put them in water, or else. Wait till you get a load of this fruit. Hey, you like them? American Beauties. They look like roses. Well, they are. Lots of different kinds of roses. These are American Beauties. Twenty bucks a dozen. They're my favorites. I guess that's because they're so expensive. There's nothing like getting what you want, no matter how much it costs. Yeah, ain't it the truth? Well, I guess these babies go in Papa's bedroom. Hey, do you mind if I turn on the radio? No, no. Go ahead. Take a drink while you're at it. Come on in here while I get a vase. Now, these daisies is nice, too, but they ain't got no smell to them, you know? Oh, but I like roses. I like them because they're red. Red's my favorite color, you know. Guess that's why I like rubies. Rubies is red, too, you know. Yeah, I know. Speaking of rubies and things, how about talking business? Yeah, sure, sure. That's what we come up here for. Well, here's the idea. You offered us 40 grand for that ice, and we want 70. That's right. The less we get for our share, the more you get for yours. Oh, no, that ain't right. Yes, it is. If we take 40, you'll get the other 30. What makes you think that? The big shot tipped it off to me. If he didn't have to give you that big slice, we could get the whole pot. Yeah. You don't want it all, do you? No, but we could get it all if you weren't in the deal. Yeah, but I am in the deal, ain't I? But you're making it kind of difficult. No, I don't think so. See, I believe a guy is entitled to everything he can get, sure. But I believe everybody's entitled to something. Yeah, as long as you're getting more than everybody else. No, no. You got me all wrong. My motto is ''live and let live.'' Take these with you, Cortig. Daisies never tell. Wait. What's that? It isn't a window cleaner. Come on in out of there. Come on! Get them up and get in here. What were you doing out there? I'm an aviator, I just fell out of my airplane. Don't get smart. All right, I'll tell you the truth. I'm Daniel Barr, I'm a cop. A cop, eh? I'll tell your mother you died with her name on your lips. Thanks. By the way, where's Cortig? He's resting in the bathroom. Have you got a partner or do you work alone? Alone. I stand on my own feet. Sit down before you get tired. Cover him. If he moves, use your own judgment. Thank you. Hello. This is Mr. Patterson. Just called you up to tell you we eliminated Cortig and we're coming over to eliminate you. What are you talking about? You're not dealing with the insurance companies now. You're doing business with me. What's the idea of having a copper planted in the room? I don't get it. Somebody's made an error. Yeah. That's what it is, an error. You can chalk it up to Dan Barr. He came over here to knock us off, but we convinced him he was wrong. Is Dan Barr there with you? Is he where, with who? I'll say he's here. He don't care nothing about leaving, neither. Put him on. I think I can take care of everything. Here. Hello, Dan. Dan, where are you? Hold the wire, I'll put him on. Somebody wants to talk to you. If he gives that dame any information, bump him off. Dan, where are you? Are you hurt? No, I'm all right, honey. I had a little trouble, but I'm all right. That's enough. Put that guy on. Me? Hello, Mr. Patterson. Mr. Patterson, you seem to think I put you on the spot, but you're mistaken. Now, if you'll do exactly as I tell you to do, everything will end advantageously. Never mind the big words, what do you want me to do? Come to the Cosmopolitan Barber Shop at once. I'll have my representative meet you there. She's a pretty blonde, a manicurist. Say, what is all this? Just hand her the package and she'll give you the money. What are you talking about? What's that? No, no. Don't do that. Don't hurt him. What? No. Everything will come out all right if you... But you've got to promise not to hurt him. What did he say? What are they doing to him? All right. Tell that blonde I'll be wearing a red carnation. I'm leaving now. I'm going over to a barbershop to get that sugar. Well, Mr. Detective, do you think you'll be here when I get back? I hope not. Don't worry. He'll be here. You'd better make up your mind. After all, you don't want anything to happen to Dan. What do I have to do? When you see a man with a red carnation in his coat, just give him the money, but make sure he gives you the little package first. What do I do then? Then bring the little package up here to me. If everything goes all right, I'll give you a nice little wedding present. You are going to marry Dan, aren't you? Yeah, I think so. You're sure he's all right, that nothing's gonna happen to him? I'm positive, you just do as I tell you and leave the rest to me. There you are now. Well, what do you say, aren't you going to do it? All right, give me the money. Now you're showing some sense. It's as easy as A, B, C. When you see that man with a red carnation in his coat, just say, ''Good evening, Mr. Patterson.'' That's all there is to it. Hello. Police headquarters? This is Richard Morey speaking. Uh-huh. The private detective. Let me speak to Chief Keilly. Oh, is it? Hello, Chief. Look, I got some information for you. Oh, don't thank me. I get mine from the insurance company. But I'm always glad to help you fellows out. Listen, if you'll go right over to the Cosmopolitan Barber Shop, you'll find the man you're looking for. He's wearing a red carnation, but don't make your pinch until you see him hand a package to a blonde manicurist. That's it. She's an accomplice, and you can get them both at the same time. What's that? I'll be there. I know your eyes are bad, and I'll be there to point him out. You're a smarter cop than I thought you was. All you gotta do is sit still and nothing will happen to you. Yeah. You don't have to be smart when know your life is at stake. You've got a gun, I haven't. That settles it. Yeah, I guess you're right. I've got a gun and you ain't, so I'm sitting in the driver's seat. Yeah. Get me a doctor. Hear anything from Dan? Yeah. I mean, no. Yeah, you mean no? I don't know what you mean. What's the matter with you, are you nervous? Say, is there a guy around here with a flower in his coat? Several. What's your favorite flower? Right now, red carnations. Here comes a red carnation. Is that your man? Yeah, I think so. Thanks. That's a pretty carnation you have. I always wear a red carnation when I expect to meet a blonde. Would you like to smell it? Sit down at my table and I'll tell you. My left hand itches. What's that a sign of? It's a sign you're going to get some money. I was expecting some, but I don't know whether I'll get it or not. I'm quite sure you will. You act like you're nervous. I got a headache. Why don't you take something for it? What would you suggest, Mr. Patterson? Try these pills. What's the idea? Yeah. I'm in the jewelry business, too. How do you like my bracelets? Say, is this a joke? You'd better get them off awful fast or you're gonna get yourself into trouble. I'm going to get myself in trouble? What do you think you're in? Hello, Chief. I hope you don't mind my butting into your business. I should say not. You did a fine job. Not bad for a private citizen. Private nothing. I didn't accept your resignation. You're still a cop. Say... You didn't make this pinch, she did. Well, she made the pinch, but I got the evidence. Here. Say, where'd you get those? Honey, you'd be surprised what you can do in the dark. Better take these two guys out of here before they pick somebody's pocket. Oh, you think you're clever. You got nothing on me. Oh, we haven't, eh? A man with a scar on his thumb should never have his nails manicured. Well, this belongs to you, doesn't it? Yeah, but you can keep it. I won't need it anymore. What do you mean, honey? You're gonna quit? Sure, why not? I'm going to marry the best cop on the force. Oh, no, you're not. I am. Here. Oh, wait a minute, all the people. Oh, what do you care? You're quitting anyhow.
