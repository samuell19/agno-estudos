People are gonna be staring at me when we go to Australia. - What for? - I'm gonna be a life saver.

(Marie cries) Let go, Paul, please, lovey, did you get the baby food all right? - Yeah, I got it-- - Oh, Marie, please be quiet, lovey, where is your bottle? Come on, then, it's, hey, oh, Mick, don't give him that, he don't want to eat a bloody onion, does he? Use your head, Marie, please stop crying. Oh, Reg, look, I can't cope, honest. If Mum don't get better soon, these two will have to go to foster. - No, definitely not. - Oh, yeah, it's all right for you, isn't it? You don't have to cope with them all day, honest to god, they're driving me around the bloody bend. - Now, look, Syl, you know what I told Mum, we're sticking together, all of us.

Sylvia's out there with them. - Better keep out of the way, they're after the babies. - Don't mind the babies, what about us two? - [Eugene] Reg, Sylvia's in trouble. - Now, you two, get out, go on. Come on, all right. - [Sylvia] Now, I know you've got a point, we need-- - [Reg] What's the trouble, Syl? - [Sylvia] Oh, it's the welfare, poking their noses in again, Reg. - Look, look, the point is that we're doing fine, Sylvia's doing the cooking, us older ones are doing the shopping and the cleaning. - And what about school? - Billy goes, he got a star, didn't you, Bill? - Yeah. - [Freddie] Yeah, he did. - And the rest of us, they can go tomorrow, you've got my word on that, my mum's counting on me. (car horn honks) - All right. (car horn honks) (kids shriek) - Oh, dammit, get off there, go on, get out of the bloody car, you lot, get off of that car, now, get out! - [Sylvia] Mick, get out of that car, come on, get inside the house! (Reg whistles) - That's Mum's whistle, that, come on! Now, come on, get in here. - Oh, and have a chat with your Mrs, what's her name? - Mrs. Booths? - That's right, yes, she's got some common sense, and you'd better put her on standby. - [Sylvia] Reg, get the pram, and get the kids together. - [Reg] Where are we going? - [Sylvia] To see Mum. - [John] Here she comes, Reg. - [Reg] John, you and Terry go on top, and Freddy, you go downstairs with Sylvia, okay?

(Snowey whines) - Get on! - [Sylvia] (mumbles), okay? - All right, go on, Syl. (overlapping chatter) - [Driver] Come on, then, hurry up. - Oh, I'm sorry about that, mate, I've left it there, all right? - [David] Where should I sit, Reg? - In here, go on. - Where's your fares? - Uh, my, my brother's got the money upstairs, all right? (overlapping chatter) - Oi, what the (mumbles) is, back it up, will you? (overlapping chatter) - [Reg] You're not eating Mum's present, are you? - [Brian] There's still a bit left. - Fares, look, your fares? - [Reg] No, my wife's paid downstairs. - Come on, off, the lot of you, off. - [Reg] I just told you, my wife's paid. - Come on, off! - [Reg] She gave you some money, I'm not getting off, she paid! (overlapping chatter) Brian, when we get up, it's off the left, all right? (overlapping chatter) - [Mick] All right, don't get your knickers in a twist. - Listen, try and get them organized, I'll go see where Mum is. - Yeah, all right, then, I'll try to get them cleaned up. Come on, David, come here, let's clean up your face, here. (overlapping chatter) And you, come here, you don't want to see Mum, looking like that, do you? What you been eating, Brian, what have you been eating before you come out? - Chocolate. - Yeah, it looks like chocolate, and now, it's all up your nose, here. Go stand over there, go and get the little ones over there, will you? (overlapping chatter) - Syl. (slow music) (train rumbles) - Is there anything else you want, love? - No, we're fine, thanks. - All right, I'll be over the road, if you want me. - Come on, listen, you know what I reckon, I reckon that when someone dies, they go where they were happy, only you can't see 'em, and Mum was happy here, wasn't she? Well, it stands to reason-- - They buried Ma, Reg, we were there. - [Reg] Mum wouldn't stop there, she wouldn't stand for that. - Reg, I'm awful cold. - [Reg] Hop in together, I'll go for supplies for you in the morning. - You all right, love? - Yeah, we've got to get ourselves organized, so we'll get Eugene to help me with the little 'uns, and Mick can do the beds, and I'll get Terry to do the shopping. - I'm freezing cold. - I'm awful hungry, Mick. - Never mind, we'll have something tomorrow. - Next month, I'll be 18 years, dammit, they won't be able to lay a finger on us then. If they did, we could have 'em in court, Mum told me. Got to get a job, though, I thought of a bus driver, but then they go to the same places all the time, it's boring, now, cars, cars, that's more in my line, tires, and all that, now, what about them things? If we had gone to Australia, I was gonna be a mechanic, I'd had a job lined up ready and waiting. I think it would be better if I get a job like my dad, get myself a lorry, getting scrap metal. You take, for instance, that school up on the hill, there's miles of copper piping and lead piping just waiting. It's quiet, isn't it? - [Sylvia] Yeah. (Snowey barks) (door knocks) - [Reg] Terry, you and Roy, do that carpet, will you? There's some more upstairs, you can do them after you finish that, okay? Eugene, you go and help Sylvia with the kids, okay? You and Mick can go do some shopping later on, all right? - All right, come on, then. - Stop playing, I want a report when I get back, all right? (Snowey barks) - He forgot about our school, didn't he? (David shrieks) - Hello. - Who are you? - [Rose] You can call me Auntie Rose. - We don't have no Auntie Rose. - You do now, lovey. (Snowey barks) - School, you lot. - Told you. - And you, and you, and you, go on. - [Billy] Don't push me. - Get a move on. Go on, you'll be late. (overlapping chatter) Now, where do we start? (wind chimes rattle) - What are you doing? - He talked, Sylvia, Mum, Mum! He talked, Mum! (rhythmic drumming) (upbeat music) (David cries out) (upbeat music) He's only gonna get dirty again. - [Rose] Well, then, we'll have to wash him all over, won't we? - [Reg] It happened sudden, Reena, I still can't believe she's gone. - I'm so sorry, Reg, she was a good person, she was. - I'm glad you've come back, Reena, I missed you. - I had enough of that lazy sod, he's worthless. - You know, now that I've taken charge, my brothers look up to me like I was their dad. Well, see, we can't mess about, we gotta, you know, really get things organized. - Well, like what? - Well, Australia, we could find out about Australia again, couldn't we? - [Reena] Again? - Yeah, I've read all about old Australia, you know. - [Reena] Yeah, I know you have. - [Reg] I had a job planned there, I was gonna be a life saver. I'm telling you, if we went there, that could be fantastic, the kids would love it, on the beach, and-- - [Reena] It's an awful long way away, isn't it, Reg? - [Reg] Yeah, but they'd love that, all the fresh air, it'd be fantastic. - [Reena] Yeah, it'd be summat, wouldn't it? - [Reg] They'd enjoy themselves. (dishes rattle) - [Rose] All right, now, pass it round. - [Sylvia] Go on, pass 'em up. - I'm bloody boiling! - [David] You moved all the beds. - [John] Did she? (overlapping chatter) - Sit down and eat your food! - I ain't got no food. - Terry, sit down. - I ain't Terry! - Sit down anyway, and pass those plates. (children laughs) Get up, get up, and sit properly, I'll teach you manners, now you'll wait for your food til after, come on. (Freddy blows raspberry) (overlapping chatter) Now, get them sorted out, come on, come on. - Told you there wasn't enough room. - Right, now the rest of you, behave. - Brian, pass the plates up, that's it, down the end, that's it, and that one. - Come on, get a move on. - [Paul] Ain't one of them plates mine? (overlapping chatter) - Here you are, hurry up. - [Sylvia] Pass 'em up. - [John] And when am I gonna get mine? - [Sylvia] Here, pass 'em up. (overlapping chatter) - [Paul] Are we eating, or not? - [Sylvia] Hurry up. - [Eugene] Blimey, I've seen that plate before. - [Sylvia] That's it, up the end, get ahold of them, pass 'em up, love. - [Rose] That's right, pass them up. (overlapping chatter) - [Sylvia] Here you are, David, pass 'em along. - [Mick] No, you're going round the wrong way. - [Rose] Here, what's going on? - [Sylvia] Well, you said pass 'em round. - Use your knife and fork. - We always use a spoon! - Not at my table, you don't. - It ain't your table. - Do what I say. - Nobody asked you to tell us. - Now, listen to me, my boy, you are going to use a knife and fork, put that spoon down-- - [Roy] Leave him alone, you old bag. - What did you call me? - [Roy] An old bag! - Yeah! - Don't speak to me like that, come on, Michael, you're going to go up until you learn some manners, get up there, go on. - You wait! - Now, I'm going to teach you manners if it's the last thing I do, you're behaving like a lot of wild animals. - [Billy] Animals, don't call us animals, you foul bitch, I don't have to (mumbles), this is our house! (door knocks) - [Roy] Thank god you're here. - What's a matter? - This old, bloody lady in here, telling us what to do. - [Reg] Don't panic, where's this lady? - In the kitchen. (overlapping chatter) She won't let you in. (door knocks) - [Reg] Let me in! - No, you stay outside! - What'd you say, "Stay out," let me in, it's my bloody house, isn't it? - [Rose] Stay out! - Oh, it's not him, it's my brother Reg. - I don't care whether it's your brother Reg or not. - 'Course it is, what are you talking about? (overlapping chatter) - Hold it, hold it! - [Rose] Them to eat properly. - Who is she? - She's moved all the beds around, and moved into Ma's room. - What'd you do that for? (overlapping chatter) - She has, Reg. (overlapping chatter) - I don't like you, see, see these? (overlapping chatter) - Get out of my way, get right out of my way! (overlapping chatter) Get out of my way, get right out of my way! Get away from me, get away! (overlapping chatter) - [Mick] Get, you old bag! (overlapping chatter) - [John] Get out, you old cow! - [Reg] Come on, I'm gonna have the bleeding council on me now! (car door slams) Bleeding hell. - Shh, what are they saying, I can't hear. - Keep him quiet, what's Reg doing? - [Sanders] You know that, it's sorted, your uncle has. (background noise drowns out speaker) - Sylvia's got to go and live with Uncle Harry in Priston. They must have paid her off, Sylvia don't want to go. - What about us, then? - I don't know, I'm trying to listen. David, be quiet! Not on the floor! - What else can we do, Reg? It's a difficult problem, and don't think I haven't thought about it, I've made dozens of phone calls, I, well, try and understand, we don't want to do this, it's just that we have no choice, it's in your own interests. - Look, okay, I understand if the babies went to foster til they can walk, maybe that's a good idea, but you can't take Sylvia. - It's all right, Reg, I'll bloody run away. - Look, my Uncle Harry hates fellows, he's only taking Sylvia 'cause she ain't a boy, if she goes, who's gonna do the cooking? - [Sanders] You'll all be moved to a home. - You'll be together. - Well, if we're gonna be together, why can't we be here, this is a home, isn't it? I promised my mum, look, send another one of them welfare women, if you want, talk to them-- - Do you know what she called us? - Reg, that's just not possible, I'm afraid. - Why not? - Now, this house is condemned, it's all part of a new development round here, you've seen it, you know that. - Look, this is our house, you can't touch it, none of us will let you. - Look, surely there's got to be some other way. - Sorry, Reg, anyway, you'll only be there til your birthday. - Oh, thanks a million, what about the rest of us? (overlapping chatter) (Alan crying drowns out speaker) - [Miss Field] You're really good going in the car, what's wrong? Come on, (mumbles), look out the windows, don't you want to look out the windows, yes, you do. - [Billy] We got everything? (Snowey barks) (overlapping chatter) - If you get inside, I'll be there in a minute. - [Roy] Come on, Snowey. - Oh, listen, can you get my bag? I've left it over there, the blue one. (Snowey barks) (window knocks) - Goodbye, Sylvia. - [Sylvia] Goodbye, love, go on, off you go. Yeah, that's it, thank you, go on, off you go, there's a good boy. - [Sanders] All right, Sylvia? - Yeah, I'm all right. (Alan wails) Oh, shut up crying, will you, please. - [Eugene] Brian, don't forget your Yogi Bear. - Time to go sit there, like good little lads, all right? Now, you stay there, don't move, right? - [David] Right! (overlapping chatter) - [Terry] Quick, will you help me with this, will you? - [Reg] Listen, this won't be for long. I want you to keep them handy, we're gonna need them soon. - Don't worry, I will. - Good. - Hey, Reg. - What? - Do us a favor and make, go and get David, will you? - Okay. - Here, come on, go on. (John mumbles) - [Reg] David, come on. (car engine revs) (construction rumbles) (overlapping chatter) - [Father Morris] Now, let's try and get settled in, shall we? Sister Dolores, have you the list, that's good. - [Sister Dolores] Sister Irene, which boys do you have? - [Father Morris] Dolores and I, with the help of the older ones, will get everything organized. (overlapping chatter) - Oh, look, oh, come on off there, will you? - [Father Morris] Come on, now, come on, you older ones, help the sisters out. - [Sister Dolores] One, two, three, are you Eugene? - Get stuffed. - Oh, I never. - Listen, thank you. (David wails) - [Sister Dolores] I want Brian, Mick, John-- - [Father Morris] Now, let's try to get settled in quite reasonably. (overlapping chatter) - Look, please, come on, look, come down. - [Brian] Leave him alone! (overlapping chatter) - What's your name, tell me. Would you like to have supper, or would you like to have a bath first? Well, I think a bath for you, come on. (overlapping chatter) Now, you little ones, can you get your clothes off? (overlapping chatter) Now, Paul, do you want a hand, little one? Now, oh, now, please don't do that, now, stop it, come on. (overlapping chatter) Now, stop it, you, get your clothes off. Come on, you can be helpful, you can be, I will leave you in charge. (background noise drowns out speaker) Get yourself washed and showered, and I'll be back in a few minutes, okay? (overlapping chatter) - Where are you going? - Go on, you get undressed. (upbeat choral music) Oh, boys, boys, now, stop it! (background noise drowns out speaker) (upbeat choral music) Stop it, ouch! (background noise drowns out speaker) Out, out, get out! All right, boys, I've got some new friends for you, come on, then, straight into bed. Come on, there's your bed, there, what's your name, David, is it? - Right! - Good, well, you pop into bed now, and you, we'll have you over there. - I don't want to be over there, I want to be with him. - [Nun] You can't sleep with him, you've got a bed of your own, hurry up, get into it. - What if he cries in the night? - Oh, he'll be all right, you pop into bed, then, now, quick, come on, and you, what's your name? You go into bed there, you go into bed over there. - Leave off. - Hurry up, now, and you, over there, straight into bed, go on, you, get into this bed, come on, now, it's bedtime, right, now, the rest of you, into bed, look lively. You can have a good look around in the morning. What's your name, Michael, John? Into bed, come on, then, come along, you, in there, and the rest of you, to bed, come along, now. Good, that's everyone, Matthew, out for the nightlight, now, good. - [David] I don't like it in here. - Right, now, we've got Terry, Terry, you're in bed one over there. (overlapping chatter) - No, I cannot, I cannot control these boys, you try it. (overlapping chatter) - Terry! - Look, there's 12 beds, you give me a good reason why not. - Look, if you can keep them all quiet, just for a moment-- - You try and keep 'em bloody quiet, 'cause I can't, I can't bloody control them. (overlapping chatter) I'm not asking for much, am I? - Look at the trouble we're having with them now. - They won't make, they won't make as much noise as these. Listen, I promised my mother we was gonna stay together, you're not listening, are you? (overlapping chatter) - Have this bed. (overlapping chatter) - You're not bloody listening! (overlapping chatter) (Snowey barks) - What's this dog doing up here? - He's all right, he's mine! - Father Morris telling you to leave that dog in the yard? - I don't care. - Now, come on. (overlapping chatter) - He nicked my bed! (overlapping chatter) - [Roy] Take your bleeding hands off of me! I don't understand-- - Now, come on, let go, you cannot have a dog on your bed! - [Roy] Why not? (upbeat music) - What is going on here, what is all this noise? - We've got a dog on the bed, Father, look. (overlapping chatter) I've never seen such behavior. - [Roy] You'd better bring him back, or you'll be sorry! (overlapping chatter) - Now, you boys, take your beds over there, now, settle down. We'll deal with it, Sister, thank you. Come along, into your beds. Now you, into bed. Now, let's settle down, shall we? (child blows raspberry) - Look at me, the dog's messed all over. - It's going to be all right, they're left alone, now, they'll settle down. - All right. - Reg! Reg! - [Reg] Yeah? - I want to get Snowey. - What about the others? - We'll get the lot. (upbeat music) - [Reg] All right, fellows, you're moving out. Come on. Now, come on, don't push. - All right, I'm going, all right! (upbeat music) - [Nun] Father Morris! (upbeat music) - [Reg] Lock the windows!

(door knocks) - [Terry] You ain't getting in here, mate, no chance! (overlapping chatter) - What are you gonna do, Father? - Don't worry, sooner or later, they'll want to use the bathroom. - I wouldn't rely on that. (drill whines) - Well, I'm as disappointed as you are, but I cannot help the entire family. I feel I may have a chance with the young ones, provided the older ones are taken away.

(wind chime clinks) - Do you fancy me, then? Well? - Of course I do, otherwise you wouldn't be here, would you? - But did they know where St. George's had sent the older boys on holiday? - No, we deliberately didn't mention it, they were settling down quite well, and we didn't want a relapse. - Well, we've got one now. - Reg, can we have a word with you in a minute? - [Reg] Yeah, what do you want? - We've got to go back tomorrow. - [Reg] I know. - Well, if she stays, they don't know about her, and you've got two. - [Reg] What do you think, Reena? - Don't mind kids, do I? - There you are, then. - Yeah, that'll get them at the welfare, fix ourselves up perfectly, they won't be able to do nothing about it, I'll go tell them in the morning, in the office, they've got to have an office, haven't they? I'll tell them straight out, then they'll have to fix the house up proper. - Reena, David sicked himself something terrible. (door knocks) - One of us isn't feeling too well, have you got something for a sore throat, or something to gargle with? - And it's one of the little ones, isn't it? You've got them there. - Yes, it's David, how'd you know? Did the welfare chap tell you? - [Mrs. Gibbs] They're looking everywhere, come in. - You didn't say nothing, did you? - Of course, not, but what's the matter about David, what's the matter with him? - What, I done told you, it's his sore throat. He's being looked after okay, I've got my girlfriend, Reena, over there, she's very good with kids, she's got, she's got a couple of her own. We'll probably get married, that'll do it. - You? - [Reg] Yeah, and then we'll be able to stay with the younger ones. - Why didn't you talk to him first? - Well, I'll make a deal, but he's got to let us stay together. - Do you know where he is? - No, I don't. - All right, give David that, one cup, and make sure you phone him. - Would you like a drink of water? He's ever so hot. - Look, I'll try and get home as soon as possible, but I've got to see Reg. (horn honks) (car engines rev) (tires squeal) (crowd cheers) - Like it? - What are you trying to do, bribe me? I want to know about Reena. - These things take time, Reg, we'll have to make sure she's suitable first. - But it's me who's got to live with her, not you. - She has two of her own, then? - Yeah. - 14 again. - I told you, she likes kids, oh, look at that. (tires squeal) - Reg, we've been forced to report your brothers as missing, the older ones were due back this morning. Now, whoever's harboring them is breaking the law, they'll be picked up. - That's no law, there's no law that can break up a family, that's murder, that is. - Nobody wants to break you up, but my job is to find someone who is willing and able to take responsibility for the lot of you, and no one can. - I can, me and Reena, together. - Look. All right, Reg, the older ones I can do nothing about, but you know, at this moment, the youngsters would be better off at Father Morris'. Now, if you'll help me get them back, I promise to do a check on your girl, then we'll see if we can find some way to get you all together, is that fair? - Have a sandwich. - But you promised! - Look, it's only for a few days, Mick, Reena's gonna go, as well, they're gonna see her. Once they've seen her, I promise I'll come and fetch you, I made a deal with him. - But why can't we stay with you? - Look, David's sick, John, he's gonna need you, isn't he? Now, look, don't tell anyone that you've been here, that's very important, you understand? Okay, come on. (overlapping chatter) - Bye bye. (construction rumbles) (overlapping chatter) - [Driver] All right, right, kids. Good lads, come on, in here. - No, of course not, in they came, bold as brass, not half an hour ago. - Yes, I'm sure. - [Frank] Come on, up you go, lads, eh, there's a good lad. Right, sorry, love. (overlapping chatter) - [Miss Field] Great, are they all in? - Yep. - [Miss Field] Oh, good, okay, (mumbles). - Thank god for that. - Well, we found some of them, anyway, that's good. - Where's Snowey? - Don't know. - Oh, no! - Roy, no, don't be stupid, Roy!

(upbeat music) (Snowey barks) (upbeat music) (Snowey barks) - [Billy] I'm starving. - We'll get some food in the morning. - They got Roy. - [Reg] How? - A fellow saw it, got Snowey first, then Roy. - Are you sure? - [Freddy] Of course I'm sure, they're after us all, (mumbles), he said to tell the police if they saw us. - [Terry] What are we gonna do, Reg? - See if the welfare are having any luck. - That girl of yours has a husband. - Yes, she hasn't seen him for years, he (mumbles) before her first baby was born. - Well, it puts us in a bit of a spot, why on earth didn't you tell me? - What's the point, she's gonna divorce him, she told me, she's gonna find him, and divorce him. - And in the meantime? - We'll just live together, with my brothers, as though we were married, and they was our kids. Well, you didn't expect me to marry that bloody woman you sent round, did you? - I'll have a (mumbles), will you? - You'd better have a look at that first, boy. - [Freddy] Jesus. - [Clerk] Hello, then, how are you, you all right? - Not too bad, gov, hello, son. Here, come on, come on, now, look. - We'll be over right away, Reg! Reg! They've got another one, now, if you've got any sense, you'll get the rest of them to come in. Let's see which one it is. - [Freddy] Just leave me alone, will you? - [Sanders] Yeah, that's him. - [Reg] What'd you bleeding get caught for, eh? - [Freddy] I've run out of money. - All right, where are the others? - As if I'd tell you. - I think you'd better. - I think I won't. - You really think he's gonna tell you, eh? He's not gonna tell you. - [Man] You people aren't helping these kids at all! - Why don't you people stop bloody persecuting those kids, and find them a bleeding home! - Don't you think we're trying? Will you take them in, or you? I'm trying to keep them together, I can have 11 of them round to your house in half an hour, 11 kids, any offers, what about you? And you're doing all talking, anyone here? No? Right. (overlapping chatter) (dog barks) - Why the hell did he go out? - Well, it's freezing. They've got him for certain. - We're all gonna freeze in here, aren't we? - We burnt it all. We can't find nothing. - Sooner or later, they're gonna follow us and find you, you know. - I know what you're thinking, but I'm not going back, ever, I don't care if I'm on the run for the rest of my bloody life. See you. (traffic roars) (overlapping chatter) Ivila! Ivila! - Yeah, Terry, what you want?

Today, a spokesman for Child Welfare said that his failure to return is hindering plans for the settlement of the entire family, and urged newspapers not to encourage their reporters to conceal his whereabouts when they have had personal interviews with him. - Look, you're gonna just have to talk to him, Reg. - Terry's right, I promise you, Reena, they've gotta do something, people don't like it. - No, I've told you, I'm not prepared to make a statement at the moment, thank you. There's another one of them, I just don't understand people, do you know my wife has three threatening telephone calls yesterday, I tell you, I'm up to here with it. - Well, we could tell them the whole story, our side of things, too. - Well, you know we can't do that, it's already become a national issue. - Oh, come on, then. - No. - Look, we'll pay you. - All right, then, five quids for talking, 10 pence for a picture, all right?

And now, this is Tom Marshall, returning you to news at 10. - I want Reg. You've seen the photographs, and you know it's a marvelous place for them to be, so you've got to get Terry back, it's a decision for all you older children to make, including Terry. - But he won't bloody listen to me. - But they need a proper home, Reg. - They don't want no farm, they want us. - [Sanders] Look, it's not a question of what they want, I've found a place for them, and we've all got to come to a decision, and for this, I need Terry. - No. - Look, Terry, it's two years for you, think how long it's gonna be for David and the others. Now, why don't you just do as I say, and give yourself up, the trouble is, you just, you just don't listen to me, do you? - You're with them, you're on their side now. - Terry, I'm not on their side, I'm just trying to help you, I'm trying to help the family, I don't know what is best. Now, will, will you just do me a favor? You've got to think of the little 'uns, that'll give us a chance to be together later on, they wouldn't be away for long, well? Now, look, now, me and my brothers have had a talk, you can take the little 'uns to the farm for a tryout, but then, we've all got to decide together, you understand? - [Sanders] Yes, okay, Reg. ♪ Dinah, Dinah, show us your leg ♪ ♪ Show us your leg, show us your leg ♪ ♪ Dinah, Dinah, show us your leg ♪ ♪ A yard above your knee ♪ Rich girls uses brassiere ♪ Poor girl uses string (group laughs) - Bet you (mumbles) they'll want to come back with us. - [Billy] Yeah. - I bet they're right up to there with it by now. - Oi, I haven't seen a bloody human being for miles. - Yeah, trees, grass, and more bloody trees.
