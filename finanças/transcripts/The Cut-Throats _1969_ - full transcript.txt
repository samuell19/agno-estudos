What are you doin', Jimmy Johnson? I'm ropin' me a steer to take home. This ain't home. It's Germany. There's a war on. Five marks. Yeah, but they promised we'd be home by Christmas. There's supposed to be six. Private Johnson was killed yesterday, sir. A German sniper got him. God damn it! I need six men, not five. - All our gear in there? - Everything you ordered, sir. Fall in! Fall in! Detail. Ten-hut! Which one are you, soldier? Sergeant Joseph Tackney, sir. Was Private Johnson a friend of yours? Yes, sir, he was. Men die every day, Sergeant. Sound off, soldier. Corporal Frederick Rapois, sir. - You. - Private Hal Parker, sir. - You. - Private John Lyon, sir. - You. - Private Edward Fuller, sir. - My name is Captain Franklin B. - Kohler III. I'm the one responsible for this whole detail. I saw the need for it, I pushed it, and I got it. And I got you. Out of 137 possibilities, I picked you men. Now you've all had your special training. Now you're going to find out what it's all about. It is the considered opinion of the joint chiefs of staff that this war will be over in two months. We have the God-given opportunity to change that to two weeks, maybe less. Just what is it we're supposed to do, Captain? You don't speak while you're standing at attention, Tackney. Now 10 kilometers from here there's a golf course in a country club surrounded by German guards. Inside there's a room used by the commanding generals of the local German army to plan their last glorious battles. There are file cabinets and charts in that room containing the detailed plans of those battles. This shows the guard stations, doors, windows, and hallways. We're going in there tonight. We're going to find those papers and charts and get them back to Allied headquarters. We're going to move fast and we're going to move light. No prisoners. Every German son-of-a-bitch soldier is to be killed. Take it down! Welcome, American. Hey, the girls made dinner for us. Well come on, take a look. All right. Let's go see. What'd she say, Captain? She says when the war is over, there'll be no enemies. And she's asking us to be friends now and enjoy a little entertainment. That's what I like. Yeah, baby, take it off. All right. That's it, take it off. Ah, don't be so chicken-shit about it. Go on, Lyons. - Go with her. - Go on with her. Go on, you'll enjoy it. That's it. Now we'll see what happens. Show her the trick you can do with five quarters. Oh, you know, I knew a guy who could do it with seven quarters. Hey Lyons! Show her where the horse bit ya. Hey, where'd he bite? Where do you think it bit him? Probably bit off two or three of those quarters. I don't know, he's been walkin' around on one leg for about a month. Come on, Lyons, smile. For Christ sake's, will ya give her a little smile? Hey, make a face, make a face. Hey, smile, baby. Oh, go on with her, Lyons. She likes the way you smile. Yeah, you got no guts, Lyons. - Go with her, will ya please? - Oh, Lyons. - Make a sad clown smile. - That's it. Go on with her. She ain't gonna bite ya. Atta boy, Lyons. - What's your name? - Tisha. Ooh, the guys back home would never believe this. Mmm, oh, you smell good. I'm just a little shy. No, Irish-Italiano. All right, all right, I'm German. Yeah, I'm German, I told you. I'm German. You are in my dreams. Yeah, you, are in my dreams. And I think of, you always. You're a very pretty girl. Don't you talk like that. means doing it, you know that? I said hush your mouth. Hush! God damn it! I said shut up! Shut up, damn it! Are you gonna shut up? You mad. Kill, kill, you happy. I kill because it's orders. It's orders, do you understand? Orders! Orders. Your order. Get outta here! I am German! Heil Hitler! Hey, Rapois, why don't you go find Little Bo Peep? I want this one. She hit you over the head with a bottle. She apologized for that. But she's my girl. Don't worry about it. She's nice and tall. Jewels. Now I'm taking more than medals home from this war. I know you know where those jewels are 'cause I got it straight from the mouth of a dying German general, one of your partners. Now you just nod your head yes. Jewels, yes? Jewels. That's a good baby. There. - Is that you, Rapois? - Yeah, boy, isn't this great? Get off of me. All right. Dang it! There must be a million dollars here. Partner, who is he? Heil Hitler. General, the war is over. Wine. All right, let's move out. God damn it, Tackney! We can't stop for Rapois. That sucker's goin' to the house. If we go this way, we could catch 'em. Why are you so sure he's gonna stop? For the papers! Thought you said the important papers were in his briefcase? Are you questioning my orders? Let's move out. Come on, move out. Back to German headquarters. Move it, Tackney, go on! Tisha. Tisha! No! Don't shoot her! Where's he going? Ah, he's chasing after his girlfriend. Shoot him. I said shoot him, Private, kill him! Go! We're the only ones left out here, sir. Inside must be Hildie and General Heit. Yeah. General Heit! I'm the only one left. Share with me, and all three of us can make it. General Heit. General Heit, we can be partners. General Heit, we can be partners. We can make a deal, General Heit. I'm the only one left. General Heit, we can be partners. Captain Kohler! Captain Kohler! I accept your offer, Captain Kohler. I accept your offer, Captain Kohler. This no good, Captain. I'll kill you first chance I get. Naturally. We should settle this like gentlemen. Sure. Very attractive weapon, Captain, but not very accurate. Very good, General. Listen and listen fast, Sergeant. There are jewels in that ambulance, enough to, enough to let us live easy the rest of our lives. That's what it's all about, Sergeant. I knew it from the beginning. Now, you help me, you help me, Sergeant, and I'll share it with you. What's the matter with you? I said I'll share it with you. Don't you understand? I'm offering you half a million dollars. You, you God damn son of a bitch! You stupid loser! You... What do we do now? We'll give this back to the government, you go to work in some damn whore house, I get a medal and go home. No, sir. That ain't how it's gonna be. I'm a German officer. You're taking me to a hospital for a blood transfusion. Blood transfusion, say it. I don't know what you said, but it just might get us through. Yeah. Sure you can drive this thing? Oh yeah. Let's go spend that money.
