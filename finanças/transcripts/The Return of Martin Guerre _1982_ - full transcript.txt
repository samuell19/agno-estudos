THE RETURN OF MARTIN GUERRE On this St Michael's Sunday in the church of Artigat, we receive Bertrande de Rols, daughter of the late Laurent de Rols and of Raimonde, his wife. And we receive Martin Guerre, son of Mathurin Guerre and of Brigitte, his wife. I, Martin, give my body to thee, Bertrande. I accept it and give my body to thee, Martin. I accept it. I unite you in the bonds of holy matrimony. You will not regret having followed this story for it is neither a tale of adventure nor an imaginary fable. It is a true story. It began one August Sunday, in 1542, in the village of Artigat, county of Foix, in the reign of Francis I. Bertrande, at her parents' decision, brings a dowry of 30 acres of wheat and 40 of millet, at the place called Pomarede. Also one pair of oxen and the Roussas woods, inherited from her father Laurent, deceased. Three red dresses, a bed and two feather pillows, one linen-chest with lock and key. That's all. Catherine. Something to drink. If you still agree, sign here. You'll have to blow hard, my boy! It's a good match, well arranged. May the Lord bless this bed with health... and keep the Demon from this house. Kiss her, Father. Martin, tender buds need to be sprinkled at night. You two, kiss your brother. Make us some pretty grandchildren! The rest, you can do without me. Whenever you want, come eat and dance. Make room! Carry on, sir. That's her. That is Bertrande de Rols. You say at first your husband couldn't consummate your marriage. Why not? Because of the spell that had been cast on him. So your mother wanted the marriage dissolved? Yes... but I didn't. I was married... I felt bound to him. People knew? Of course. We had no children. They made fun of him? Yes... the whole village. Tell me what happened that Candlemas Day. A serenade for Bertrande and her husband! If you're tired of sleeping at night change husbands! Change husbands if you want to have children! Don't be afraid. I am Jean de Coras, of the Toulouse Parliament. I am now in charge of this matter. You must tell me everything. Even if the priest said not to. It's caused by evil thoughts. They put a spell on you. I'll take it away. Blessed Flesh, I unknot you. Blessed Flesh, I unbind you. Blessed Flesh, I make you grow again. Accursed Demon, leave this servant of the Lord! Merciful God, shed Thy Grace on Martin whose flesh is suffering. Merciful God, shed Thy Grace on Martin whose flesh is suffering. Merciful God, shed Thy Grace on Bertrande whose flesh is suffering. And do your best to help things along. And that worked? That very day, yes. We had a son. His name is Sanxi. So all was well. For me, yes, but Martin... Martin kept to himself. He didn't even look at our son. He didn't like farming. He and his father argued. You want us to die of thirst? Where were you? You can't do anything right! I was with some soldiers, at the stream. Two sacks of grain are gone. You seen them? You stole them. You loaded the grain. You stole them! You stole them! Our family doesn't steal! I'll make you hate the taste of bread! I didn't take them! While I'm alive, I'm the master here! Look, Martin, aren't they pretty? Wear them Sunday. You cut them too big. You wasted your time. You always scold me. It's not my fault. Be nice sometimes. I'm sorry. That was the night he left. Why steal the grain? Did he know he was leaving? And needed money? Maybe. I don't know. He didn't talk much to me. What did you think? That he'd be back soon. Everyone thought so. That his father had scared him. He waited for Martin every day for months. Finally he died... killed by sorrow. Martin's mother died a year later. Your mother got married again? Yes. To Pierre Guerre, my husband's uncle. To keep the farms together? No doubt. Our lands are now held in common. The wolves are out tonight. Make sure the animals are locked up. Yes, mother. I do it every night. You little rat! Filthy rat! Did Martin stay away long? Eight winters, or nine. You never heard from him? No... Nothing. But I'm sure you had no lack of admirers. No, but I kept my virtue. Speak up, we can't hear you. I kept my virtue. Ask anyone. I remained chaste. You never forgot Martin? I prayed to St Catherine to send him back. So many seasons passed... Then she heard me. Hello, there. Who are you? Do you have some water for a thirsty man? Who are you? Don't you recognize me? Look closely. - Do I know you? - I think you do. Aren't you Mathurin Guerre's son? - Is it you, Martin? - You bet it is! You're back! And you're Jacques, Etienne's son. No, Jacques is my brother. Right... You're "Smallpox André". Remember the bear hunt, when Nicolas "castrated" me? Made me miserable, didn't you? Martin Guerre is back! You're bigger, Martin. War does that. Martin Guerre is back! - What are you saying? - You've seen him? Yes! He's down the road. Guillemette, your brother! - Are you sure? - I saw him! The son of Mathurin? Bertrande, your husband's back! Come, it's your husband. You still here? Hello, Barthélemy. Where've you been, Martin? We thought you were dead! Hello, Jeanne, sister. Martin! At last! You've changed! Where's your husband? Are you Guillemette? You were so small when I left! Come kiss your brother! Sanxi? You're so big. Don't be afraid. Come nearer. I'm your father. Hello, uncle. You were gone a long time. That's true. Forgive me for what I did. Your father and mother are dead. I heard, and I prayed for them. I also heard you married Raimonde... my wife's mother. It's good news. My daughter has suffered. Have you changed for the better? You're here... It's all true! Is it really you? Is it you, Catherine? You haven't changed. I wondered if you'd ever come back. And here you are, safe and sound. - Where's Bertrande? - At the wash-house. She's waiting for you. To the wash-house! It's me. It's me. Martin. Hello, Martin. My God, my wife is beautiful. It is a gift of God that you have returned. He was in the Army in Picardy. Don't you recognize me? Who are you? It's me. Nicolas. It's confusing, seeing you all. Here's cloth from Flanders. The nicest for Bertrande, with lace. Catherine, take the last one. You've learned to read? And to write, too. To write? What did you do all this time? I fought in the war. I even went to Spain. Then I wanted to see you. All of you. What's Spain like? It's dry. And Paris? Did you see Paris? It's big. There are people everywhere. I even got lost there. There are thieves at night. You're so strong now, Martin! This calls for a celebration! When you left here, Martin... you didn't have a beard yet. And you didn't drink as much! Now I drink like a monk! After war... Peace! To you, my wife. A little rough, but not bad. Just enough to kill the worms! I'll prepare your bed. It's good to be on your own land. What are you looking for? The candles. In there. You moved them? No, they've always been there. Then I forgot. She cried a lot because of you. Remember, Bertrande? Go get my white breeches, the one lined with silk, from the linen-chest. If they're still there. I'll go. You've found your smile. "The bird's back in the nest. Tonight they will not rest." They're still here. Waiting for you, like me. I'll wear them tomorrow. How often I've wanted you... I'm here only because of you. So everyone recognized him? Yes, everyone. His sisters... His uncle... Catherine, the servant? His friends... The whole village. You, too? Me, too. Without hesitation? Then what? He took up his work, his place at home. We had two children. The first died. The second is alive, a girl. 18 months old. And everything went well? Very well. Better than before? Yes. And he worked hard. Our harvests have never been better. And between you two? It's been good. When did the doubts first begin? One day some vagabonds slept in the barn. YOu! A game for 15 points? I don't gamble. Then buy a saint's image or a holy relic? Go to the devil, we have a priest! I'm going back. I'll play- Dominique, play with me. No, I think not. Like Martin. Come on, Father. Only 15 points. Who is he? It's Martin. Martin Guerra, who went away and came back. Like the prodigal son. He's not Martin Guerre. I knew Martin Guerre. At the battle of Saint-Quentin. In fact, he lost a leg there. Of course, it's Martin. I ought to know, I'm the one who married him. But it's not. He's... What's his name again? I knew him on the Army, too. It's Martin! We're even related. I tell you he's not Martin. He's Pansette! That's it. Pansefie. He's from the village of Tihl. I knew him in Picardie, too. What's he doing here? I saw two of those people in Arras. From a land called Brazil. Their bodies were all painted. They had feathers on their heads. It's true, Sanxi. Feathers are for them what silk is to us. They were in chains, and made to dance. In their own country, they go naked. Even the women? Sounds like a nice country. Then you should go there. They eat their prisoners' hearts. Are they human? Do they have a soul? The monks say they do. In some tribes, they share their land and their women. In others, the women go to war and make all the decisions. The day women rule here, it'll be the end of the world. Tomorrow we'll have a north wind. No! Let's go home, I'm afraid. Why? See! A circle of smoke. Spirits will be out. We mustn't look at them. Pansette! What are you doing? Leaving us already? Trying to find your way? When are you going? Did you come to the wrong village? It's you! Doesn't surprise me, idiot! He's strong! Not like Martin. Right, Bertrande? Pansette, you look true but you play false. Beware! Where was this soldier from? A garrison in Picardy. Don't believe tales told by strangers. And by drunks. Or by rogues. He's right. "Lies come easy from afar." We know Martin well. If anyone knows Martin... it's us. We must do our accounts one day. How much my land earned in my absence. What do you mean? You worked my land and I'm grateful, but it made a profit. Now I need the money. I figure it's about 6000 livres. You dare ask me for an accounting? I, who raised your son while you roamed the world? I, who protected your wife? I, who welcomed you back and forgave you? It was your duty! I went to war, I have a right to it! You have no right. You left! Yes, I have! I have the law on my side. I'll seek justice, if I must. You'll be condemned. You threaten your uncle? I need that money. I'll sell Gold Cross Field and buy Pujol's. To plant barley. You want to sell your father's field? It's too steep for planting. You're starting to squander our property! But I expected it. I'm not surprised. I warn you... Martin or not Martin... you won't get away with it! What did you say? Repeat that! What did you say? Let go of me! But when he came back, you recognized him, too. The whole village did. You all welcomed him. Look at Bertrande. She's not complaining. She's never looked better. When he came back, he'd been gone a long time. What if we were all mistaken? He's changed a lot, hasn't he? Reading and writing lead to all kinds of mischief. You're right to stand up to him. You be careful, too. After me, it'll be your turn. He'll wipe your ass. And take your shirt! He'll pluck you clean and go away again. Leaving you your eyes to cry with. Then you'll see what kind of man he is! The work isn't finished! I'm ashamed of you, uncle. My father wants you. I'm coming. What do you want? I've thought it over. You're right. I have the money. I owe it to you and I'll give it to you. I don't want any trouble. Know where your father hid money? No, he never told me. In the hay-loft above the stable. I'll wait for you there at cook's crow. I'll give you your due. But let's keep it to ourselves. Their heads are empty so they tell tales. They're all jealous. Seeing us happy makes them piss vinegar. All they talk about is us. Calm down, my uncle has understood. He'll shut them up. Give me your hand. Let me guide you. Is that her name? Yes, that's my name. It's in the grain chest. You wanted it, right? You wanted what we owe you? You're going to get it! Your money's worth... in hard cash! You won't ask for it again! At your service, Pansette! Hit hard, he has a tough hide! You were ready to die for him? Yes, to protect him. Explain something to me. You defended your husband, risking your own life. But when his uncle attacked him legally, you didn't say anything. You should've protested, talked to the judge, told everyone: "I know he's my husband." But you said nothing. Why? Did you have doubts, too? How could you, of all people, have had doubts? At one moment, I was troubled. I wavered. I thought... Speak up. I thought: "Maybe he's fooling me, too." Charming me, as he did others. Then my daughter is a bastard. And I'm living in sin and will go to Hell. Yes... I had doubts. And still have? No, not any more. Then he is your husband? Yes or no? I say yes. And what does he say? The same thing, obviously. He says they're man and wife. It got so confusing, I took it to the Parliament. Go join your family. You are Martin Guerre? Yes, lam. You're quite sure? I don't know of any other. Walk on. You're going TO Pay- You're an impostor! You tricked us! The law will punish you, you cheater! You tricked us to steal our property! Silence! The family apart... Over here. Now listen to me, all of you. Those who honestly think... this man is not Martin Guerre, to my left. Shame on you, Nicolas! Those who honestly think... he truly is Martin Guerre, to my right. And you? I am their priest. But surely you have an opinion. The others have no opinion? In settlement of this dispute, I, Jean de Cores, Councillor of the Toulouse Parliament, declare that there is no reason to believe this man is not Martin Guerre. The charge is dismissed for lack of proof. This man shall be released. Pierre Guerre is condemned to pay 500 livres to the king and to his nephew for calumny. Free him. You are a knave! God knows it and will punish you! You hold water in one hand, fire in the other. That was an excellent judgment. What happened to my brother? You should be in bed. On your feet. This time we've got you. Get dressed. - What? - Get dressed. - You're under arrest. - I was released yesterday! Things changed during the night. Look. This time, your wife signed, too. - My wife? - Here. Get dressed! You're going to Toulouse. When did she sign? Last night, before going to bed. Is it true? They made you sign? Hurry UP! This time, you're done for. The accusation is the same, but it will be more difficult to answer. - Your wife signed. - It's a forgery! If so, why did she let them arrest you? Her uncle and cousins scare her. They might cut her throat. They've threatened her? Often . Especially lately. She now says you betrayed her. That you're not her husband. That's serious. I know her. They forced her to sign. Assure her safety, and ask me what you want. You'll see I'm Martin Guerre. We've heard many witnesses, and we shall hear more. Shall a councillor defend you? I don't need help to prove who I am. Who married you? Father Dominique Caylar. He's still there. He doesn't like me because I swear a lot. We married on St Michael's day, 18 years ago. Who was the notary? Jehan Pegala, from Le Fossat. He was late, my father was upset. Bertrande's dowry was the Roussas woods, her lands at Pomarede, two oxen, a bed with feather pillows, and three dresses. And sacks of grain. Have you forgotten? No. No sack of grain. Since returning, you've been a loving husband. That wasn't so before. Had I known my wife better, I wouldn't have left. And she's changed. So have I. You're not stupid. You know you risk death? It's all Pierre Guerre's doing! I was his nephew until I wanted my money. Everyone knew me: my sisters, my wife's mother... Even my wife. Others also say you're not Martin. My uncle's rich! They're afraid of him. He acts out of self-interest. He'd rob me of my name and my property. It's outrageous! Follow me. You are Jean the Spaniard and Valentin Rougier? You asked to see this man. Do you know him? Yes... It's him. Who is he? What's his name? It's Arnaud. It's Arnaud. They call him Pansette. Where is he from? Our village. - He's from Tihl. - You're sure? He left a long time ago, but that's him. - Not Martin Guerre, from Artigat? - No. Arnaud, from Tihl. Called Pansette! Look at them. Look at them! They're sent by my uncle! Bought and paid for! Look at them. Shame written on their faces! They're from Tihl, that's been verified. So what? My uncle has influence. Why would I pretend? To have a house and a wife. But it's my house, and my wife! I'm wronged, and I'm accused! Never was a husband so maligned! But I'll appeal... To the Parliament, here. I want my uncle to be punished! So it'll all be clear! I want them all here. First Pierre, guilty of bearing false witness. Also my sisters and cousins. And my wife who was forced to sign, and all the villagers! All those who've known me since I was born! Artigat has been my parish for 23 years! I knew Martin Guerre well, I married him. When he left, he was thinner, darker and a bit stooped. He had a cleft chin and slightly drooping lips. And a hairy mole on his neck... Show us. Here, on his neck. There's no trace of it. And a scar above his right eyebrow. Also not there. No, sir. That's wrong. I knew Martin when he was little, too. I diapered him, and saw him naked more often than you! He had no hairy mole. He had a scar on his forehead... and still has. It was closer to his eyebrow. It was here. I ought to know. He fell in the barn, I picked him up. Also... Open your mouth. He broke two teeth. There they are, in the back. And a pushed-in thumbnail. So you maintain that he is Martin Guerre? I'm sure, sir. As sure as night follows day. May I speak? Speak. I've seen death. I heard the rear of cannons and the screams of the wounded. You wish me ill, uncle, but I've lived through worse. But must that be a man's fate for wanting to live a little before returning to his family, to work the land God gave us? Don't let him talk any more! He's clever with words. We know who he is now. All he wanted was my nephew's property. I don't want to take it, I'm defending it! He's not my nephew. Ask the cobbler, he'll prove it. Cobbler, step forward. Is it sure they'll let me go? If I say what I have to say, canlleave? I guarantee you'll return to your village. Before he left, Martin Guerre had a very large foot. His size was 12 points. After he came back... his size was only 9 points. You're quite sure? Yes. In my trade, I've seen feet grow bigger, but I've never known feet to shrink. You're getting old! Your sight's going... You forget things. I see better than you, you old mule! You see where your interest lies! Jacmette, your fingers remember. Tell them who I am. Tell the truth. You're Martin Guerre. Bertrande, my wife, you know me better than anyone. Swear I'm not your husband and I will yield. Swear it on the Holy Gospel. You won't swear it? Therefore I am your husband? You are my husband. Step forward, Bertrande. And this cross? I didn't draw it. Then why didn't you protest? They threatened me. Who? To throw me out. She's lying! - That cross is her mark! - It's the truth! They'll do anything! They tried to kill me! It's her mark. I saw her sign it. I didn't sign! I would have signed my name. How? You can't write. I'd like a quill and some paper. Pierre, how long are we staying here? I don't know... As long as it takes. Who pays for it? I'll pay You- Enough to live on. That's the law. Who is Bertrande de Rois? Why do you want her? She is to be housed separately. You see me, Blessed Virgin Mary. You see the distress and sorrow I'm in. I'm begging you, help me- Protect me. Didn't Pierre offer money to Dominge at your inn? Accused, sit down and stay seated! Continue. Continue. Didn't he? Money to pay for killing me! Call Dominge Pailhas. Is he here? Come forward. Don't be afraid. Tell the truth. Did Pierre offer you money? Be honest. Yes or no? Yes, he offered me money. I said I wouldn't kill a relative, even for money. I'm sort of related to Martin. It's true, that's what he said. Thank you. Go back to your seat. Jeanne, come here. Speak up now. Didn't uncle urge my wife to accuse me? It's true. Didn't he threaten to throw her out? Yes, it's true. Didn't he raise his hand to her? It's a lie! Silence! Let me talk to her husband. - Augustin, come here. - The accused will remain seated! Augustin, come here! You lived under our roof. After the soldier had been there, you said: be careful. My uncle was sending people after me to beat me up. Remember? To teach me a lesson. You must remember! We'd beaten the Vals team 4-2, a Sunday in August! I remember. It's true. So, uncle, you thought I'd never find out? He's the impostor, the criminal! He should be sitting here. If Arnaud of Tihl was a sinner... who profaned God... What do I care? I'm not Arnaud of Tihl! I'm not that man! I'm not that man. The man's memory is prodigious... and he's very clever. What if he were a demon? It has happened before. Demons like to enter human beings and poison their minds. What do you think? Lies have a thousand faces... even the Demon's. Truth has only one. And justice exists... to discover the truth. He knew everything. Better than anyone in the village. When he came back... he knew my sons' names! He'd look at me... I couldn't move. I felt that I was... on fire! I'm sure he uses magic. Even here, with all of us! Since the world began, Satan has had a store of magic. How can he know so much? And have all the answers? He is the Devil's emissary. Perhaps he is a devil himself. I'm not a devil! Silence! Sit down! If a devil is in you, speak. Tell us his name. A devil? Then I'd be with my wife! I wouldn't have been arrested! I wouldn't be here! He answered well. There is no proof of any magic. What should we do? AW Suggestions? The most humane solution... Presume innocence if guilt is not proven. But first... I'd like another chance to question Martin Guerre's wife. The Court turns to you. Now... and for the last time... lask you... if that man is your husband. Yes, I'm sure. How can you be absolutely certain? Speak. We are here to learn all. On his return, he knew all about me. Did he know intimate details, only a husband could know? What? What details? He knew when I wanted him... and the words to say... before... during... and after. The Court... will now retire to deliberate. I think that does it. This peasant seems to have won his case. He's Martin Guerre. It would be inhuman not to free him. We'll clear his name. Could anyone else have defended him better? In the name of the King and of his justice... this Parliament... Mr. President! ...hereby declares that the accused is indeed... is indeed Martin... One moment, gentlemen. A new witness insists on being heard. Have him come forward. You claim to be Martin Guerre? Yes, that's my name. Silence! Stay where you are! Where were you? In Picardy. The Army. I lost my leg at Saint-Quentin. Back in Artigat, I heard what was happening. Here I am. Do you know that man? We soldiered together. Do you know his name? He's Arnaud of Tihl... Pansette. Don't listen! Look at them... Having lost, they try a last ruse! A beggar, hired by my uncle! Do you know that woman? Bertrande, my wife. It's one last low trick! Accused, stay in your seat! You wrong me and you insult me? Wrong you? I've never laid eyes on you! Why don't you arrest him? He's a hired liar! Silence, both of you. Pierre Guerre, step forward. You and your wife. Do you know this man? Yes... Yes, I recognize him. Martin, my nephew. Let me embrace you, Martin. At last you're back. You're quite sure? He's my brother's son. And you? He's my son-in-law, returned to us by God. Arrest him! Stay seated! Proof he was paid! He arrives now... just in time, like a miracle! It's God's doing. The hand of God, manifesting itself! It's divine justice. God has sent him to prevent injustice! To your seats! Return to your seats! Don't forsake me! It's a plot against me. In my own family! You sir, above all. Please listen to me once more or else I'm lost. I'm Martin Guerre, from Artigat. He's a paid liar. He was taught what to say, but I will confound him. Let me put him to the test! Do it. You claim to be me. Tell me... On my wedding night who gave us the nuptial bowl? She did. Catherine. She tucked us in. I was bewitched. How many masses were said for me? It's so long ago and I'm tired. Answer! - Six... - He's wrong! He doesn't know! Not six... four! Answer, you know. Tell the truth before God. I said four masses, it's true. You should have been better informed. Where was the spell broken? At the priest's. Was it hot or cold? Cold... I was naked. That's true! I was naked. We warmed up quickly! Who bought the sacks of grain I stole? Smallpox André. You learned that lesson well... Another thing... When I went away, what did I leave in the linen-chest upstairs? What did I leave? I left it! What was it? White breeches! Sewn by Bertrande. And you didn't know. - I told you about them! - I told you! Don't twist it around! Arrest him! I've proven I'm Martin Guerre! One moment. You say you told him? And he's trying to use it! But before you said... you didn't know him. Accused, sit down. The sisters, come here. Which one is your brother? Make up your minds. This is my brother. It's Martin Guerre. No, you're making a mistake! And you, Guillemette? What do you say? I can't remember. I was too little. Maybe it's him. He's my father! You treated me like a brother... I am your brother! Silence! I order you to be quiet! Catherine Boére, come here. What do you say? Me? Yes, you. What do you say? Of no importance... I'm not family. Catherine... Tell them. Forgive me, Martin. Don't cry... Women cry easily. You should have known your own husband. Our house is dishonored. It's all your fault. You're to blame, Martin. You betrayed my friendship. You deserve no pity. What harm in caring for a woman her husband deserted? We await your confession... Arnaud of Tihl. It's true. We soldiered together. He talked about his wife... his son, his house... One day on the road, two men took me for him They called me Martin. It gave me an idea. I thought... Why not take his place? So I learned all I could. Martin said he wasn't coming back. I went to Artigat, I was taken for him. I almost told them: "I fooled you! Martin's up north!" I almost said it. Then I saw you. I took you in my arms. Next day, it was too late. After that, I learned whatever I didn't know from my uncle, sisters, wife. And I remembered it. There's no magic in it. I swear it. You don't deserve her. I know her better than you do. I ask you all to forgive me. You. Them. And you... who were my wife. Your men can stay in the barn. Pierre Guerre, you brought discord to this village. Now keep the peace. Leave us, please. I'm thirsty. You have dared much and feared God very little. We hesitated before declaring you innocent. It was unwise to take that stranger into your bed. Women are often the victims of men's wickedness. That's why we acquitted you. And legitimated... your daughter's birth. We hope that now... you will be a good wife. But tell me, between us... so I'll understand... Before Arnaud appeared, you needed a man? And this one pleased you? Did he satisfy your need? You loved each other? You knew from the start? You can tell me. It will go no farther. Arnaud and I... were good together. Martin had neglected me. Arnaud respected me... like a true husband. I trusted him completely. We thought of asking to be judged. We could have won. If Martin hadn't turned up, we'd be man and wife. No one could've denied it. At the last minute... Why did you change? Why choose Martin? In Arnaud's eyes... I saw it was hopeless. I saw what he wanted. He wanted me to live... for me and my children. So I did it. God forgive me, I defiled marriage. The King, the law, all those I offended... forgive me. Stand up, Arnaud. Guards! Open the door. God forgive me, I defiled marriage. The King, the law... all those I offended, forgive me. Commend your soul to God. The story of the false Martin Guerre ended that morning. The Councillor, Jean of Coras, impressed by this daring imposture, made a record of it. 12 years later... came the St Bartholomew Massacre. For his Protestant beliefs, Jean de Coras was hanged before the Toulouse Parliament with a hundred of his friends. But we live only by the spirit. All else dies.
