(Music) The golden cream cake in this year's painting competition goes to: Alexander Kapsner. Ladies and gentlemen. The giant cream cake, I present to my dearest friend, Lotte! - Yes! Yes! Lotte! Knockout. Alexander. Hugo. I know what's going to happen. - Get ahold of yourself together, Heini. Yes! Yes! Yes! - Lotte. Oh hell! I won't jump down! The Mole should jump down himself. I'm finished with your invention! - Heini! Are you crazy? Come back at once! You yellow bastard! - Yes, of course. Because I'm stupid. Does it say "fool" there in capital letters? - If he says something like that again, I'll find another brother. - And now? I'll jump. You said, that nothing can happen. - No! "Warning Mortal Danger" We don't need this anymore, right? I wouldn't dare! If the rope is too long, then the skin of your kneecaps will come out by the shoulders. Are you ready? - I'm ready. Good. Then let's go. It's for science. It's for the future. Good. This is not the first company that I have handled, Mr. ... -Ametsbichler. (Gruber) The furnaces are cold, and the rooms are empty. -Alexander! I knew this was a problem. - That is the reality. It is clear to me. -Alexander? Is it working? Yes. People want to work. Reinhold. Don't fall asleep. Come here. What do we do now? -Pull him up again. (Taschner) For my sake, can 2 or 3 of you people lend a bit of a hand. Yes. There are 800. Well. Is anyone there? -Get out! Why disappear? Look, you'll be caught. This is burglary. Get out! (Mole) Into my lab! (Music) Keep going. Quickly! Come on! Let's go! Kids! - The Ametsbichler. Keep out of the upper floors. Or I'll rip your heads off. You have no business up there, understand? - They say that Ametsbichler ate his wife in the pangs of hunger. Psst! What's in there? - Drawings for tomorrow's presentation. If I win today's painting competition, I'll buy myself five cream cakes. If I win, I'll share with you. - I will too if I win. You win? -Drawing was never your forte, right? Mole will probably win anyway. -Who knows. Let's get out. Hey. While the competition is yet to be decided, hands off Lotte! As a matter of honor! Agreed? -Agreed. Let's see. You'll see, Paul. Soon enough. (Music) (Door opens) Psst! My son is sleeping. Stay quiet. You must heal me. - Yes, exactly! (Klari laughs) Mom, I peed in my pants. -Alexander! Dad? Dad? Dad? You're back. - Hey, hey, hey. Ugh, go away. -Stop that! Dad? - Get away. But Dad. This is a bit too much for me. Perhaps another time. Goodbye! - Dad? Stay there. Otherwise I'll be alone. - That's exactly what he wants. He knows you're not his father. - You have to stop your wishful thinking. What if your father were standing there? - Who knows if he'll return. One should never give up hope. Eventually they'll find him somewhere. Maybe he lost his memory. Perhaps he is arrested, and now they've freed him. You've already said that yourself! - Stop it! Alexander, tell me honestly ... Is this your father? - Yes. And what is this? - A tattoo. He doesn't have any tattoos. You like the chinese faces too? Why? - Because they're grisly. As if they were torn by a nail. -What? Yes, they grimace as if they bit into a lemon. Or as if it tickles. - Stop it! Just look at your Chinese. - Please stop now. Come on. - Now stop it. "FOOL" Hey, there you are at last. - Come on. And Heini? He's still sleeping. How much do you have? -40 Pfennig. That's not enough! Maybe he'd give it to us for that. A heartfelt greeting to the madam. - Thanks a lot. Goodbye. Come on, now hurry. (Pastry chef coughs) Do you want it now or not? - Yes. But I don't have enough money. I have 40 Pfennig in my pocket and it costs 55. Could we negotiate? No. You can't. - It didn't work! Come on, try it again. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - What is it? - Mister pastry chef. I had another proposition. I'll get pocket money next month. So I thought, if you'll loan me 15 pfennig, I could buy a cream cake. Next time I'll bring along 20 pfennig. On my honor. -If I now begin to lend my clients money, I may as well close the shop. Now go. I have to work. Do you know what? I'll stop shopping here. - You do that. I won't buy anything next time. If you treat your customers like that, I will never buy anything again. You fool. - That's enough, little snotface. I'll get you yet. That will be something! (Mole) A cream cake, or what? (Confectionery) You can have finger noodles! (Heini) Waiter? Waiter? Is someone there? I'm in a hurry. I'm late. Ah, finally. Good God. I don't have enough money. I only get 40 pfennig in pocket money. This costs 55. Can we negotiate? - Yes, certainly one can negotiate. And how one can negotiate. Go away. (School bell) You set the alarm clock forward. That's why I'm almost late. Cleaned up! Why do you all look so stupid? I won't let myself get pissed off. Or does it say "fool" in capital letters? - Yes! Look at yourself some time. Shit. There's payback, you pig. (All) Good morning, Mr. Schloder. Be seated! Heini? - I have no idea who you meant. I meant my brother. - So, so. Forward. Now, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice". Bastard! - And it would really be nice, if you would wash at least once a week. Please. The sorcerer, my old master left me here alone today! Now his spirits, for a change, my own wishes shall obey! - Come in! (All) Good morning, Mr. Director. - Good morning, everyone. Quietly be seated. - He's surely from the fifth class. Yes, right! - This is Reinhold Gruber. Starting today until further notice he'll be in your class. He's the son of Gruber, the bankruptcy administrator for the steel mill. I hope your group will be friendly toward him like last year with Lotte, okay? So, children, goodbye. (All) Goodbye, Mr. Director. - Sit. He's so old. - Quiet please! We don't want to create a bad first impression, right? Please sit in the back row and pay attention, okay? Heini. Please! Go, I say, go on your way, do not tarry, water carry, let it flow abundantly, and prepare a bath for me! - Really nice. Well, now I'll show what one can make with toothpaste, shoe-fat, coquina and butter. Now pay attention. I see nothing. - I see nothing either because you're always blocking my view. Your father is Glaser, right? Don't keep us in suspense. Where's the trick? The color mother of pearl. That's kids' stuff. (Mrs. Heintze) Good morning. Good morning, Mrs. Heintze. - Be seated! You know, next week is the deadline for the painting contest. I hope that's motivation enough to put aside your amusements ... and devote yourself to your task. (Music) Nice, Mole. (Unintelligible voices) Nobody is waiting for me as usual. B-Karli. It's not that I have something against you, but you're on our class's side. "We Are All People" That's really nice. - Belongs to my father. Does that help you in school? - I borrowed it. My father is away on a job. May I have a short look? Yes, but be careful. Look out! Can you lend it to me now? - No, if my father notices that it's gone, he'll kill me. - Please. Just for one day. You'll get it back tomorrow. I promise. - Hey, B! Your hand is on our side! Get out! - I'll bring it back tomorrow. Tell me, can't you read? A and B. And you live over there. Otherwise, you'll get it. - You asshole! What do I know? (Music) No ice balls. - No prisoners. No prisoners! No one shall be dug in. - Noone can be dug in. Not in an honorable fight. - Not in an honorable fight. Do you now need the support of capitalists or something? One can't pick with whom he fights. Long live the B! (All) Long live the B! Long live the A! (All) Long live the A! Three ... two ... one, go! Come on now, old broom, get dressed, these old rags will do just fine! You're a slave in any case, and today you will be mine! May you have two legs, and a head on top, take the bucket, quick hurry, do not stop! Go, I say, Go on your way, do not tarry, water carry, let it flow abundantly, and prepare a bath for me. You're not supposed to rub that on girls. - Then I'll get you! Admit that you're the losers, then he'll be free again. - Cheating! Get away from there. Come here. Stop it! Prisoners don't count! Excuse me. I didn't know that. Sorry. Your new member is excluded. Good, Reinhold. Really very, very good! (School bell) That was brutal. - Hubert? Do you know where B-Karli is? What do you want from him? - I must ... He already went home. He had stomach ache. And three points above a one grade. I got a two. Tonight is a movie at Vogel's. Hugo and Heini are leaving us free. Are you coming? Of course I'm coming. What is showing? - "Die Menschenfabrik des Dr. Knopf". Oh, by the way, I'm glad that you didn't dare jump yesterday. I dared myself. - That's different. I'll dare you. That'll get you back. (Knocking) Hello, Alexander. - Gruber? What are you doing? Yes, you disappeared so quickly today. Aha! We're drawing? -What do you want? I thought to myself, maybe you can help me in math. As compensation. I helped you against the B. Whoever is helped will return the help. I'll get it from you tomorrow near school. - Explain how you don't need me. It would be good if by tomorrow my homework were in here. Alright. - I thank you. (Parrot screeches) What is that? It looks so wild. Where did you get that? From my father. -What does he do? He's a ship's cook. But we've not heard from him for a long time. Most recently he was on the "Admiral Windson". - They were on David Street, right? Yes! And they were heading to China. But there they were capsized and since then he has been marooned. - I'd like that to be the case for me too. What? - That my father would be marooned. They really say marooned? I don't know. - "Marooned"! Yes. That he would be marooned. Because of him, we move every few months. I would wish for myself that is how he'd be. - Well, yes. You're also still a boy. Goodbye. (Music) How did it get in there? Paul, that's the Mole's new invention. The color mother of pearl. Look. (Parrot screeches) You have to wait a bit. Even he won't get any, right? The color mother of pearl. Oh God! Shit. (Knocking) Alexander? Are you there? Give me my book back. I need it! My father might soon come home. Alexander, I hear you. Now open up, you bastard! Alexander, please! My father expressly forbid me to touch the books without permission. You dirty pig! (Music) (Shouts) Damn. Greetings, Mr. Vogel. - Greetings. It has already started. - Hello, Hugo. I am Heini. Door closed! Pst. Greetings to you! -Where were you so long? It was stolen from us in class. - The lovelost drawing book. Who knows if they're telling the truth. - Shut your mouth. Heinrich! Heinrich? It seems to me, Heinrich, you are more interested in every monster, than me and our love! - Elizabeth! Never! Swear to me that you really think that. - I swear! And I wish to be examined by a lie detector. A lie detector. That's it! - I love you, Elizabeth. I love you. (Music) I love you, Lotte. I really love you. But I can't love you. - But why not? Because you're a thief. A common thief. A thief? A thief! Goodbye, Alexander. Well then. See you tomorrow! - Don't let him bite you! Good night. (Heihei) Let's go, Lotte. Come on! (Heihei) Hey, Mole. You've just got to find a lie detector. That's not enough! -What? How would you know? Not 4,50 marks for the book. But Mrs. Kerkenreuth. 4,50 marks, that must be enough. I absolutely need the book. - Yes, that might be true. But that's not enough money for the book. You must understand that. This is special. How much does the book cost then? - It depends on when you come by. Sometimes it costs a bit more or a bit less. That's what's special about the book. Undisputed is the rule among men on earth ... Undisputed ... is ... the rule ... Mr. Direktor, had a stuck car. I helped push. Ah, yes. Of course that's excusable. Then you certainly have my thanks too. Did you help to push me as well? May I the join the Direktor in the car tomorrow? Eh? Yes! Have you seen Alexander? - Yes, back there. But that was long ago. Thank you. Where's my book? If my father finds out that I lost it, he'll kill me. B-Karli ... - For the last time, where's the book? What sort of book, B? - Don't kid around. You know which book I'm talking about. - I've seen no book. You're lying, you dirty pig! - Don't be disrespectful! The B's have a bit too much imagination. Otherwise I'll go to Ramsauer! -If you're going to Ramsauer, you're not going anywhere. Got it? - You assholes. Ah! You could say thank you. - Thank you. What happened with my math notebook? There. Now we're even. Yes. Now we're even. By the way. About the Admiral Windson, you must be mistaken. It only sailed to the west, never to China. There. Look. And also: "Sank 10 years ago." "No survivors." It simply can't be the case that you got your parrot 5 years ago. You've been deliberately misled. (Music) (Gumberger) The largest and smallest choose. Gruber begins. No, Knockout. I like Alexander. Knockout. - Mayer. Mole. Heihei. Hugo. Beni. Mährt. Heini. Posposchill. Ferdinand. (Whistle) Pull. Yes. Cleaned up! (Parrot screeches) Greet your Dad warmly. - Greetings. Greetings. What's wrong? - Nothing. Where's Paul? Alexander, what's going on? Alexander, please answer me please when I ask you something. He flew out the window. You left it open. I shut it. I didn't leave it open. What's going on, Alexander? Alexander, you're lying. - I'm lying? Maybe you're lying that Paul is from Dad. I know that Dad was not in China, and also not on the "Windson". It sank 10 years ago. You simply lied. -Alexander. Leave me alone! -Alexander! I lie. I would lie. Do you know who lies? You lie! If you hadn't lied, then all of this wouldn't have happened. Then Paul would still be there. You're to blame! I'm telling my mom! Paul? Paul? Paul? Paul? Look. A feather. - It's from Paul. We may well need it. -Why? You'll see soon. Lie down here. Good. There your feet go, and I need you barefoot and take off your coat and your pullover. What? - For the science and the future. Man, Mole! Nobody learns. And certainly not Alexander. And especially not Alexander. So, are you ready? Then let's go. Already, right? So. It can't simply be gone. -What is it with you? The paint is gone. Hey, Alexander. Do you have the paint after cleaning up last time? Mole, truthfully, I have ... not seen your paint for a long time. -Where have I put it? Who has drawing class after us? - The B's in the fourth hour. The B? Sure, B as in blockhead. The Mole has forgotten that. The B pocketed it. Yes, I wouldn't wonder. Every B steals. B are cheaters. - Hey, you know what? Before Heintze comes, I would first find out, who from the B is sitting in the Mole's seat. Hey, B? Hey, B? Excuse me for disturbing you. But I've found a ten in the hall and now wanted to ask: Which of you sits in the 3rd row in the 2nd seat? - That's my seat. You know that I sit there. -Aha! Merci! What about my ten? Now I know who it is! Mole. It's B-Karli's. He sat in your spot. It's all the same to me. - Knockout, stop! That does not mean he has the paint. - How so? Perhaps B-Karli pocketed it by mistake. - Aha. Like my drawing book. - They will get away with even more. What do you have against the B? - It's clear that you like them, Lotte. They've still done nothing to you. Not yet. But Mausi for example ... Exactly. It's not just always about you. - I'm also quite sure that a B took my pencil. - One can't let that go anymore. (Boy) Everything has to be locked up. - Perhaps it was taken by an A. It's not true that it's one of the A's. - Exactly. Does one of you have the mother of pearl paint? No! - Then where is B-Karli! Stop it! Why don't we just ask B-Karli? - Good idea. We'll do that. We'll do it tomorrow. Before 1st hour. -If he has it, God have mercy on him! (Music) Woe is me! Both pieces come to life anew, now, to do my bidding I have servants two! Help me, o great powers! Please, I'm begging you! And they're running! Wet and wetter get the stairs, the rooms, the hall! What a deluge! What a flood! Lord and master, hear my call! And they're running! Wet and wetter get the stairs, the rooms, the hall! Lord and Master, hear my call. Ah, here comes the master! I have need of Thee! for the spirits that I called Now have abandoned me! Now have abandoned me! Now have abandoned me! Very true. Very true. Excuse me. I didn't want to wake you. What's that to become when it is finished? - Nothing. Alexander, about your father... - No. Alexander. Please! Alexander, listen to me. Alexander! Alexander. Your dad is alive. And I have lied. You're right. He was never on the "Admiral Windson". Your dad was ... your dad was ... your dad was a real asshole. and he never wanted to know about you and about me, in three attempts to reach him. And where is he now? - I don't know. I wouldn't like him either, right? I don't know. Please, I'm sorry. that I told you so much ... I'd rather have told you. Maybe it's better to lie a little bit, right? (Gruber) Mayer? Mayer? Do you want to earn 50 pfennig? Honestly. You do the following. This page now belongs to B-Karli. (School bell) Let's go. Come on! (Posposchill) There he is at last. Sit yourself down. I'll watch in case Haselböck comes. Heihei and Lotte said you wanted to talk to me. What's up? B-Karli. Please tell us where you sit in drawing class. We already know that. - The third row, second seat. So, Mole, that's your place. - You're after us in the art room. Did you see a small flask with paint in it last Tuesday? And took it? By mistake perhaps? - Admit that you stole it. And don't lie. - Knockout. Stop! No, I didn't find your paint. - With that you've settled the matter. Sure. Settled. Don't be angry with me. Any B is lying when he opens his mouth. One moment Pospo. It isn't so simple now. One should investigate the matter thoroughly, so that no suspicion of B remains. We'd eventually reach the truth. That's why I now suggest that we search his school bag. Search my school bag for all I care. You'll find nothing. So, that's all. - And this? What is this? (Boy) Look! - He painted in mother of pearl. You liar. - I don't have the paint. Someone planted me with the paper. - He caught you red-handed. He is not only a thief, but also a liar. Like all B's. Low-down B. Long live the honest A. (All) Long live the honest A. We meet today with Alexander. -What? That's impossible. It will go well. I'm sure of it. Alexander! Alexander, now stop and wait! What's really wrong with you? With me? I would rather ask what's wrong with you? What do you mean by that? - Do you keep secrets from me? No, Alexander. Aha. Alexander? Thank you for coming. The reason we're here is this: You know what B-Karli has done. And you know every other B would do the same without hesitation. We must protect ourselves. What are the B's? - The Bs are Bs. No. What are they in reality? Mayer? Thieves, liars and criminals. - Exactly. Thieves, liars and criminals. But now there is more. Alexander and I have found out, that there's someone among the A's who is worse than any B. What? In the A's? - Yes, sure! Hugo. No, Lotte. - The Mole. What? The Mole? - The Mole is the friend of the enemy. And that's why he's our ... Mayer? - Enemy! Like his friends. What unites our struggle is that the friend of our enemy is an enemy. How do you now mean? - How do I mean? The friend of our enemy is an enemy. Do you understand? Yes, now I understand it. - Good. And anyone who aligns himself with them is forsaken. Bravo. - Where are you going? I won't be a part of this. -Aha. You'll be sorry. Why will he be sorry? - Because it's an advantage to be part of a community. Today we are a community. Today we are a gang. - Yes! The oath that unites our struggle, the friend of our enemy is an enemy. The oath that unites our struggle, the friend of our enemy is an enemy. Rules are needed in every gang. Alexander, please read to us. The enemy of our enemy is a friend, that is what unites our struggle. The enemy of our enemy is a friend, that is what unites our struggle. Please. Rule No. 1: From now on, we'll follow strict rules. Yes. The oath that unites our struggle... We need uniform dress. - The enemy of our friend is a friend, that is what unites our struggle (Alexander) Everyone will wear a brown cloth. There will be guards. There is no more passing through for B's. They'll go around the outside in the future. (Gruber) Yes, Mausi, keep going! - Rule No. 4: In strong demand are perseverance and discipline. Rule No. 5: Traitors will be found and mercilessly punished. (All) The friend of an enemy is an enemy. (Alexander) I'm in charge. When I raise up my hand, everyone say "EL", and when I lower it, then we'll say "DSA". Rule No. 6: Our secret greeting, which is: "Long live the proud A", or abbreviated: "ELDSA". EL-DSA, EL-DSA, EL-DSA... EL-DSA, EL-DSA, EL-DSA. - Now you're going to get a beating! Shoe polish won't hurt anyone. Tomorrow there will still a beating. EL-DSA, EL-DSA, EL-DSA... Just as I had envisioned. Now we just need a fund. What? A fund? -But I have no money at all. Everyone contributes only as much as he can. - And then? We need to repair the damage that the B's have caused. For example, you'll get your pencil back. - But I'll also get my drawing book. Yes, Mausi. In the 2nd settlement. -Who will manage the fund? Someone who is trusted by everyone. - Well, generally I trust in noone. You trust me, right? - Yes, whatever. I trust you. Then I would be happy to take it. Very good. I also think Alexander is the best man for it. Alexander, you collect the money. - Also, I had another question: Why are the B's actually worse than us? Well, once again, honestly. They are only by chance B's and we, by chance, A's. Heini. There are no coincidences. It's simple, this is the way it is. And one need not explain truths. Do you understand? - I get it now. Thank you. - Don't ask such stupid questions. Come on. An endurance run. (Hugo) Alexander. Alexander! They've formed a club. Today, they want to capture the 4th window. Heini has opened his big mouth. I told the others. By the way: Everyone wears a brown scarf. Damn. Hey, people, listen up. The Lie-o-graph is ready. - Finally. Today, at 3, there's a presentation in the lab. There we'll find out what's wrong. What's wrong? - I fell off the bike. In winter? Today during break, there's a battle. Yes, against the B's. And they formed a club. "ELDSA". - ELDSA? Hey, Pospo. -What? Go away. I said you should leave. I'm done anyway. Yes. And I believe, hold on tight: Alexander is also with them. Clearly that can't be true. Alexander? Alexander? Was Hugo already there? - Yes, he was also already there. Damn. Please don't turn me in to Gruber. If you could have kept your mouth shut ... So, consider this 20-man crew, which we are calculating for, sunk our ship at sea. Now we have water rations for 15 days. (Boy) Share it around. And a 20-man crew. So now the following shall happen: On the third day there will be fog. There will be a sailor swimming in the sea. - May I also sponsor Gruber? Are you joking me? - I hoped you liked joking with me. But apparently you're being serious. - Now we have 30 men on board. Yes, I'm serious. What's wrong with it? -Alexander, what's wrong with you? Gruber is a complete liar. - How long will the drinking water last? How can it be calculated? - And you? I only say: "Take off the pullover". For science and the future. - Are you spying on me or something? Mole? Which computating method do we use? Huh? Direct rule of three. - Direct rule of three, Mr. Haselböck. Direct rule of three. That is the method ... - Thank you. But they'll lose the battle anyway. Mr. Haselböck? - What's the matter now? I have cystitis. May I leave? - Yes. How much water will we still have on board after two days travel, huh? (Singing) All seekers of this world ... unite yourselves in the kingdom of heaven ... (Knocking) Come in, if it's not the Direktor. - Excuse me, Mr. Gumberger. The class speaker assembly is not around 12, but rather now. We are missing only Hubert. Are you coming? - The class speaker assembly? All the others are already waiting for you. - Well, go on. Are you bringing the right tone with you? - Yes, Mr. Gumberger. I will. And ... There is an attack, get it? - No. The ELDSAs want a battle, get it? No. - I know what we can do, so that they beat themselves, okay? - No, I don't understand. "Entrance for students strictly forbidden" Wimmer! -What? We could use a "screen". -How so? (Music) Get into position. - Gruber, when will it begin? Hey, Gruber. They all belong with us. No, they don't belong. ELDSAs! Attack!. Yes! Is that all? - It's over. Long live the B! - Long live the B! Long live the truth. Stop! Reorganize battle positions! We're fighting ourselves. (All) Good morning, Mrs. Heintze. Reinhold. We'll be going to the Director. Into the classroom! I didn't see through the smokescreen. - I didn't see who you were. You're laughing, but soon you'll cease. ELDSAs! We have a leak. -How so? Has someone pissed in his pants? Who was it? Hugo beat me for so long, until I gave up. - That's a betrayal. But I didn't want to. Really. - You will suffer for that. But he paid the most money into the fund. People, it's not about money. It's about respect. and if one shows no respect, we'll make him to give it to us. And so today we'll impart to Hugo a lesson that will absolve him. Today at 3 is the Mole meeting. We're meeting at half 3 at the steel mill. For what unites our struggle: - A friend of our enemy is an enemy. Dismissed. - Thanks, Gruber. Is there something else? I've now collected from everyone. Do you have to pay too? Obviously. What do you mean? That would be even better. Thank you. - The thanks goes to you. Let's have that. What are you doing? - That's for secret ELDSA purposes. For what sort of secret purpose? -If I were to tell you now, would it still be secret? No. Hey! - I, as treasurer, control the money. What are you doing with the money? - And I know who has the book. And the paint. Don't forget that! Mrs. Kerkenreuth. I've now collected more money. Is it enough? - Yes. That's enough. But now I've just sold it. Things go awry. - What? I need that for sure. -Oh, you meant it seriously? I'll take it like this and eat it immediately. -If you say so. Here you are sir. Thank you. See you again. - See you again. ELDSA! ELDSA! - Where are you heading? I must take this home quickly. - It will soon be the ELDSA meeting. Exactly! A lesson for Hugo. This goes first. I'll be right back. Hey! But you live over there. Where is he going? (Heihei) Stop! Wait. - Hurry. We're late. I still have to tie my shoes. (B-Karli's mother) He's sorry. (B-Karli's father) Stay right there. (B-Karli) No! (Father) I have told him so often. If he can't remember, then he can remember it this way. Let's go! (B-Karli screams) (Mother) He can do nothing about it! (Father) Then who can do something about it? Perhaps I? Hopefully, you'll remember it. (Mother) Alexander took the book away. He shouldn't have taken it with him. (Music) (Music) (Music) And they're running! Wet and wetter get the stairs, the rooms, the hall! What a deluge! What a flood! Lord and master, hear my call! Here my call! Ah, here comes the master! I have need of Thee! for the spirits that I called Now have abandoned me! Now have abandoned me! Stand right there! My dear friends. With this machine, it is possible to shine light into the darkness of lies. It will expose every liar, when he tries to lie. This machine will expose him. My dear friends, the ... Man, there you are at last. - Yes, something interfered. A sausage sandwich? - No! Hugo! Ah, Heini. Man, Hugo. From now on it is futile to lie. I've invented an apparatus that will expose every liar. The Lie-o-graph! Madness. Every scientific theory is proven only if it withstands practical testing. A volunteer is needed for the couch. I could do that. - No, Heihei. You get on the bike. Freely. I start pedaling. - You, Mole. I'll sit on it. You are much too heavy for the couch. It would be destroyed. Hugo, you are the one I'd prefer. Hugo! - Don't fall asleep, Hugo! Yes, it's for science and the future. - And I must do it again. Tell me, does it say "fool" in capital letters? Wait a minute. Now I will reveal Hugo, I mean, Heini's statements. This is Heini. We'll tie him up. - Where did you leave Hugo? I don't know. - Where is Hugo? Now! I'll get him! That'll get you back! Traitor! So, Hugo. You again have the chance to redeem your betrayal. You merely need to sign the statement and you'll go free. So? Are you going to sign now? Mausi, fetch the schnapps. (Posposchill) Shut up! So, Hugo. Now you see a real lie detector. (Posposchill) Shut up! (Heini laughs) Heini, where's Hugo? - I don't know. He's lying! You merely need to sign. - I'll sign nothing at all! Here goes! Here goes! I would rather die, than belong to you! No. He's lying again! - Give up. We'll soon find out. Tell the truth! - I can say nothing. The oath that unites our struggle, the friend of our enemy is an enemy. The friend of our enemy is an enemy, that is what unites our struggle. They are in the 5th Hall. -We must go to the 5th Hall. As I've already said: You merely need to sign. I'll sign absolutely nothing. So, Mole. Hopefully you've constructed this well. (Music) Hugo! Hugo! Hugo! (Alexander) Yes! - Traitor. Yes! Yes! Pig! -We'll pick you up from down there! I'm falling. Leave him alone. Leave that. Stop! Quickly! They're coming! Stop! Stop now! This makes no sense! Don't be stupid. Stop. This makes no sense! Hey, what's going on? You have no business here. Got it? ELDSAs, retreat! - Are you crazy? Tell me, what are you doing? - Go! Miserable snot-faced brat! Make sure you keep going. And don't get caught in here anymore, Otherwise, you can count up your bones. You're all completely mad. What cleverness won't you come up with? You! What have they done to you? You! What have they done to you? Do you realize what can happen? You can die. You have nerves of steel. (Heini laughs) You, this is no joke. You've broken in. Is that clear? I need only call the police, and they'll arrest you. And then lock you up. So? What do we do? Huh? Should I call? Or will you tell me your name? You, I'm talking to you! I'll call now. Are you listening? (Parrot screeches) Paul? Paul? Paul? Paul, how did you get here? Paul! He belongs to me. -Aha. And where is it that you live? Now give up. You can't make a phone call. The cable ends there. (Knocking) Good God. - Greetings, Mom. Paul flew to Ametsbichler. He has a tattoo. Merely coincidence, right? -What? I don't understand at all. What happened? - Nothing really happened. Alexander! Mom, that's a long story. - I must go. I only wanted to see that he made it home. - Yes. Thanks a lot. Yes. See you again. See you again. (Singing) All seekers of this world unite in a heavenly sound. And the human sorrow and joy join in the hymn. Sun, moon and all the stars watch over mountains and lakes. Delicate seed wants to blossom. Pure heart, you shall never perish. The oath of friends shall never waver. The strength of the group flutters in your heart. Heavenly bliss in God's hand shall blossom on this earth! My honorable ladies and gentlemen, worthy faculty, dear, esteemed colleague Mrs. Heintze, dear students. It behooves me now, as every year, to do the honorable task in proclaiming the name of the winner of our painting competition. Please. - Thank you. Soon we will all know in whose young artist's hands I have the honor ... - Go on. ... to award the prize. - Now there's still time to stop. The golden brush for the best work in this year's painting competition ... in the theme "The profession of my father" goes to: Alexander Kapsner. For his painting "My father, the sailor." Yuck! That can't be. Congratulations. Do you want to say a few words? Thank you for the prize. But I cannot accept the prize. I copied my painting from B Karli's book, which I stole. And I have stolen Mole's mother of pearl paint. It was in the knapsack. And so all this shit got started. Gruber blackmailed me. But I blame myself, because I never dared to admit it. And everyone sitting out there who thinks that the A is better than the B, the price is tremendous. It isn't true. B-Karli, I'm very sorry! I hope all of us can continue to be friends. Everyone! Indeed, Alexander! Respect! I simply wanted to win the prize because... Because I like you so much, Lotte. I never dared to say so. Yes. That was certainly a revelation in two ways. This is brave, I have to say. But as you have now so carefully worded, you haven't earned the prize at all. Yes, that's true. But each of us knows who ought to really win the prize. With his most beautiful invention: the mother of pearl paint. Isn't that right, Mrs. Heintze? Yes. - Mr. Director? Yes. There, Mole. The golden paintbrush is for you. Yes, well, with that done I have no more things to set straight. But I rejoice all the more. Think no more about the golden paintbrush or the first place, but rather about what Alexander just did. With that I cannot accept the prize. -Why too can't you? Because I didn't entirely invent the mother of pearl paint. but rather got it as a gift from Mrs. Kerkenreuth. - This is something special. Yes, but for me this is really too much. Here we have nothing but swindlers. The prize won't be awarded this time. Who do you think you are? This is a disgrace for the whole school. What shall we come to if we should suddenly only speak the truth? Naturally I was referring to the lies! (Heini laughs) (Music) (Choir singing) What appeared to me in dreams, will not come in the flesh. Pearl white clouds float luminously above. Flying in silence along their paths, taking with them all the misery of this earth. All misery. Flying in silence along their paths, taking with them all the misery of this earth. All misery.
