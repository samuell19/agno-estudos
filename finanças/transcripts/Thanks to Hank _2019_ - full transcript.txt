People need to know the story. They need to know that you can't, you just can't hate all the time you can. Because of Hank, I don't hate those people. If it hadn't been for the way Hank trained me and let me in on things, I probably would hate their guts. I'd probably be in jail by now. Today I see the respect that gay people are getting, transgender specifically, and I just can't believe what we went through to get here. I just can't. And that's why, honestly, I miss Hank every day. It was hard. If you looked sickly, and you looked wobbly or gay, I don't know. I have to say gay and poor and Black, I have to say that, because it wasn't just gay. If you were white and gay and you were in the Castro or something, it wasn't as bad for you, but if you were poor, it was really kind of rough. It just hit everything. It just ravaged everything: community, family, friends, people, economy, just everything. It just wreaked havoc. And it was kind of mind boggling. And when I look back, I understand how in all of that, but at the time, in the moment, it was like a slow-motion earthquake. It was like this sort of slow kind of rolling rumble that you didn't know how big it was gonna be until you turn around and realize, holy shit, we are surrounded by people that are dying of AIDS, that are at the end of their rope, that have been pushed out and dropped out of every other place, and now they're here, and this is the last stop. You're at the Ambassador? This is it, man. We gotta make this work because if this doesn't work, there's nowhere for you. Here's a guy who was willing to take that on. I mean, again, I know I'm kind of beside myself because I... How do you decide to do that? What kind of person decides that that's what they're gonna do? A guy like Hank, that's who. - The answer is in us. - We're ready to go forward. We just need to look around. The call will come out in the future, and when it does, if one of us stands up and says, "I need help," let's look around, and let's go to that person's help. And if we do that, we'll pass the test. If this were a man or the woman holding hands, it would be considered perfectly natural, even if it were two women. But these are men, and for men in this society, to hold hands in public is at least shameful and more often offensive. But men who want to hold hands in public or in private are emerging from the shadows. They are homosexuals, men who relate sexually to other men, and they with women who relate sexually to other women, lesbians, have begun a battle for their civil, legal, and personal rights. Homosexuals who acknowledge their homosexuality and pattern their lives accordingly are known as gay, and the gay liberation movement is challenging a society that abhors homosexuality. This is a very electric time. The women's movement was starting, civil rights movement and the anti-war movement. A lot of shit was hitting the fan. They gay movement was beginning, and there were bars and things, and it was all very exciting, but there was always some missing pieces. For instance, the bars, and this always pissed Hank off, the bars, even though they were gay owned, discriminated heavily. So they had these ridiculous ID requirements. I mean, they're so absurd. One was no hats. That was supposed to keep out Black people. Speaking of San Francisco and how gay it is and how together those children have it, I couldn't even go to the white gay clubs unless I went in with Sylvester. With three pieces of ID. And I was cute then, baby. And fine and could dance and crazy. Was all that. To this day, I don't go to the Castro for nothing. You know, those whores can stay up there and do whatever they do, honey. I'll take care of down here. There's some good people everywhere. I am not trying to put everybody in one big thing, one big, deep thing, and I am not trying to be racist, but I am definitely on guard till the day I die. So it started with a flyer on a telephone pole. Are you tired of being discriminated? Do you wanna see more this in the gay bars? So I went to the meeting, and Hank was in that room. Kinda hard to miss. I looked at him, he was very handsome. And then when it was his turn to speak, I thought, "My God, he's such a flaming queen. He looked so butch, and yet-" He was one of the movers and the shakers in B.A.G.L., Bay Area Gay Liberation. B.A.G.L. was a little more inclusive because it had more people of color. Black gay liberation group came out of it. GALA, Latino gay came out of B.A.G.L. Gay American Indians came out of B.A.G.L. And the gay Asian group also came out on B.A.G.L. My first impression of Hank was he was very intense, very focused, very smart, and very generous and warm. He engaged people, directly made eye contact, and he amused them. And some people thought, "Holy shit, this guy's bat shit," to their loss, but you couldn't help but see how sincere he was. Yes, he was scattered, but that's what he preferred. He liked that. He liked to multitask, and he liked to be right there. He didn't like to be removed. At the same time, he was a very modest person, very modest person. And I can't say that for a lot of people, particularly myself. He was totally down with gay liberation and a little bit turned off to what was even then a gay establishment. People were a little nervous about confrontation, and that was the other ability that Hank had. He encouraged that he was inspired by that, and he knew if you were too nice about things, they weren't gonna happen. The apartment in an of itself was a train wreck. It was very small, first of all, and it had a bathroom. I don't wanna talk about the bathroom. I will not talk about the bathroom. No bed, some kind of thing on the floor. Not even a futon. Cockroaches, I can't. You know, one crawled in his ear once. And I said, "So how are you doing?" Said, "I had to go to the ER." "What?" "Well, yeah, a cockroach caught in my." A lot of people refer to Hank as Saint Hank, and of course he hated stuff like that, but there was a wonderful group of gay men who dressed up as nuns and do great charity work, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, and they had a ceremony where they declared Hank a saint. In the name of the goddess who knows and sees all, I hearby direct the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence to call the spirits from the four cardinal directions to center us and to create a sacred space. Walk in the spirits of light and love. Bless this group and the community we serve. May the spirits guide us and remind us of those that have paved the way before us. The gay drive for acceptance has produced no single issue as volatile and emotion taxed as that of how homosexuality should be dealt with in public schools. He was particularly committed to gay teachers. And on the left at that time, people were saying, "Yeah, that's good," but they didn't prioritize it. Hank and I, we were gonna do this thing, was gonna call it the Gay Teachers Coalition. So he and I and Ron Lanza, who had just recently quit his job around a gay issue, we couldn't even find a place that would give us a room, and, finally, a more lefty liberal kind of Quaker place gave us a room to meet. We went to the Board of Education. We wanted to get employment protection for gay teachers, and we were rebuffed by the school board. They voted seven to zero against us, and so we organized. And we were real upset, and so we went out to the community, the gay community, and we tried to approach the different leaders to try to fight back and get them to reverse themselves. And we approached the traditional leaders at that time in San Francisco gay community and asked them for support, to be speakers at our rally and stuff, and none of them would do it. We were told that it's a good struggle, but it's the wrong fight and the wrong time. And Harvey, without hesitation, he said, sure, he would come. That created like a whole new group of leaders in the city because the old leaders didn't lead, and then we had a new batch of us that could be called leaders because we were doing stuff. Tom came out, I think, two days after they voted seven to zero against giving gay teachers employment protection to basically slap them back in the face, and said, "Okay, here I am, I'm a gay teacher." 95% of the teachers have always been real supportive of me, and I feel real respected for my skills and my professionalism. And as far as the children go, they've always been great. "Are you a sissy? You're wearing an earring." And I said, "Well, I'm your friend and I'm your teacher, and that's the most important. And as far as the word sissy goes, it's like the word people use like when they use bad words about Black people or Spanish people. It's used to keep people apart, and it used to make people feel bad." And it's always been my experience that a direct answer like that to a direct question more than satisfies the child. - We held a press conference. - There were five of us. And we said, "Here we are. Look at us, we're teachers." We knew that the young people, the kids, supported us, and we knew that the parents respected us as good teachers, and we knew that our peers, the other teachers, knew we were doing good. So we really were confident that if the spotlight was to be shined on us, that we would pass with flying colors. We also knew we were playing with a taboo thing of children, gays, you know, role models, all of that stuff. I snuck into the teachers' room, made a bunch of flyers, smudged, with misspellings, nice for the teachers. And he was already pretty much in the letter scene, and I was marginal, whatever. So he said, "Let's go out tonight and give out the flyers." And I said, "Well, great." And he said, "You're not gonna wear that, are you?" So I said, "No, all right, all right." I found something that looked a little leathery. I mean, please. In comes Hank, me, you know, throwing up his big hands, "Come to this thing and come to this," you know, walking around the. Totally not self-conscious. I was a nervous wreck and Hank was totally in heaven. He just, he was, "Look what we're doing. Look what we're doing," you know? He always had that kind of enthusiasm. - What is your name? - Ron Lanza. Why are you here tonight? To protest the board's position. Position of? - Their anti-gay position. - That's why I'm here. Will the secretary call the roll? The favor saying aye. - Pat Bilson? - Aye. - Patrick Husby. - Aye. - Patrick Harra. - Aye. - Peter. - Aye. - Martina. - Aye. - Pat Green. - Aye. And then I, aye. We didn't expect it. I mean, we expected some changes. We didn't expect it to happen so smoothly. It's B.A.G.L.'s real first victory, and it really shows the need for an organization of militant gay activists to organize. It was so easy. It was, it was very easy. What was fun we got employment protection in San Francisco that year. We got employment protection, the elementary schools, before they did in the colleges. And we also got employment protection in the schools before the police department said it was okay for gay people to be in the police force. And we used that as leverage. We said, "Well, look, if we can work with the young people and the kids, then we should be able to work with adults." That's kind of funny. We had a real sense of historical energy, the whole group of us. We knew that what we were doing would be a first, and we had so many firsts. We had a series of firsts. When the unions would do solidarity stuff with us, that was the first, that was history. When the school board gave us our victory, that was history. When Harvey was first elected, that was history. Was taking a lot of gay liberation mentality and like putting it out there. Can we be our own advocates? Do we have to have other people represent us? Can we represent ourselves? Just a real sense of gay people standing up, fighting back, not always winning, but just to stand up and resist felt real good, being, I think you call it, what would you, what would be the word? Pushy, that's it, pushy. Very push. And we also got off on insulting people that insulted us back, to be pushy back, you know? Everybody was always pushing us down, and all of a sudden we were pushing back, and it felt good to push back. Even when we didn't win, it felt good because we held it. We kept our dignity by asserting ourself. I think that's half the battle. The battle over homosexual rights in Dade County, Florida, the battle pitting singer Anita Bryant against gay rights activists, comes to a vote there Tuesday. The issue is whether or not to repeal a four month-old ordinance which prohibits job and housing discrimination against homosexuals. Anita Bryant was once known as an orange juice sales woman, not anymore. With a religious fervor that has made her America's most controversial woman overnight, she has been selling her Save Our Children group. Her group is crusading to repeal a new Dade County law which protects homosexuals in jobs and housing. Save Our Children collected 62.000 petition signatures, forcing the ordinance to be put before the public for a vote. The homosexuals or gays immediately began their counter attack. A do or die campaign went into high gear. I went to Miami to study the campaign because it was based on teachers. I felt like because if it was successful, it would be a domino kind of thing, and it would go, you know, would come in other places, and we wanted to kind of like see the ammunition that the anti-gay people would use against us, Anita Bryant and those people. So I went there and we collected the literature and we talked to people. I also wanna study the kind of campaign that we ran so that if it was to come here, we'd get some ideas on what to do. They would have straight people speak for gay people in Miami. I felt like it would have been important for Miami to put a call for gay people to go there so that the people that are gonna vote on our rights could have met some gay people and actually had a personal interaction. There was a decisive end to Dade County's homosexual controversy 200.000 Miamians told of their elected officials they wanted no part of a law which protects homosexuals in jobs and housing. Gays vowing not to give up staged nighttime demonstrations in New York's Greenwich Village and the streets of San Francisco. 5.000 homosexual and supporters of gay rights walked through the streets of downtown San Francisco last night, protesting the victory of Anita Bryant's anti-gay crusade. San Francisco is widely viewed as the gay capital of America. They have an annual gay tricycle race and a gay softball league and a city law that prohibits discrimination in public employment because of sexual orientation. And while the vote yesterday was in Dade County, the Florida anti-gay forces made it clear that San Francisco was at issue as well as Miami. They had a vote up in Eugene, and I went there to study also to see what would happen. And in Eugene, we went door to door. Very courageous for these people to do this stuff, you know, to go to our door, especially in those days. And we knocked on people's doors and we told them, "Hello, I'm so-and-so, and I'm a homosexual." And I don't think that people were ready to have a live homosexual at their front door. We knew it would be coming because they're opportunists. It was a good vehicle for them to make political capital out of. So we were ready. I mean, we had our core group. We decided we wanted the people, we wanted to involve and do a grassroots campaign where we involve as many people as we could from our community. We wanted people to be sitting out there at tables and do door-to-door stuff, and that's what happened. We went out and became our own advocates. Hank Wilson's spirit definitely infused that part of the campaign that I was involved in. You know, he was always there. He always had his clipboard. He had his things. He helped people get through that, 'cause there was a lot of doubt. We won no matter what the vote was because you had millions of people that got an exposure to gay people, lesbians and gay men, that they had never had before. I mean, if we had not had Anita Bryant or Briggs, millions of people would not have seen hundreds of us and our marches. So it was a real opportunity. It was real... Put the issue out there in a way that had never been put out before. We've been talking about gay teacher's lifestyle, curriculum, the gay matrimony lately, but the big issue in the gay community is as simple as law and order. Gay people are simply afraid to walk the streets at night. Beatings are an everyday occurrence here in the Castro neighborhood. It's one of them that hassled me before walking home and said, "Queer, faggot. We're gonna beat the shit out of you," something to that effect. "We're gonna kill you." I started running as fast as I could. Got up... The middle of the street, they knocked me down and started beating me with their hands and their feet, their elbows. I had gotten jumped and beaten up, and I couldn't even make it home. Was able to call Hank, and he came and, he came and picked me up and he took me to the hospital because I was going like, "Well this arm is..." And this arm wasn't moving. I mean, even now with all the surgeries, this is high as it goes. But I try to just act like, "Hey, hey, I can make it. There's nothing really wrong with me." But he took me to the hospital, and he stayed with me throughout my surgery. We were a nonviolent street patrol. We gave out the famous ACME Thunderer Whistle, and the idea is if someone is under attack, if you are under attack, you blow a whistle, and everyone who can hear you blows whistles and also calls for help. The whistles alone can scare off an assailant or even a group of assailants, and the idea was to take control of our own safety. The gay bashers were coming right into the Castro neighborhood at the time. They would sometimes shout anti-gay epithets as they went by, and then they would go to the periphery of the neighborhood and wait to find someone that they could gang up on and beat up. So we set up two people at a time standing on corners connected to the others by walkie talkies. Hank continued that until Community United Against Violence was founded. He was one of the founders of that too. "The Examiner" set up an interview with some members of the Butterfly Brigade. Hank at one point said, "What's it gonna take to make people realize that this is a problem? Is it gonna take a riot? We're ready for a riot." "The Examiners" labeled us a vigilante group and said we should be dismanded immediately. And then they refused to print a rebuttal that we wrote. All these folders are filled with information and abstracts and letters and materials that Hank compiled, working just on the issue of gay youth suicide. Hank was one of if not the first person in the country to really focus attention on this issue. He had been meeting with people all around the country, he had been participating in workshops, and he had been compiling data and statistics on youth suicide. Hank was masterful at getting information and using that information to the best advantage. And specifically he believed that there was an increase in gay youth suicide as a direct result of the work of Anita Bryant in 1977. He would get all of this data from people, and he would immediately be able to zero in on what was the most important aspect of it. And you see the youth suicide numbers go up in 1977 and go down in 1978, and of course that's when Anita Bryant was conducting her crusade. Good afternoon, Ambassador. The hotel is, I think it's a total sanctuary for the area that we're living. I'm really thankful to have found it. I'm Joel Roberts. I grew up on a farm in Western New York. I don't know how it was for the closet gay kid at that time, but I know those who came out paid a price. Usually it meant you no longer had any family, so in a way, the street was the only place to go. Middle-class gays were in the closet. They weren't gonna help us. We were really on our own. I remember being on Market Street in the Tenderloin. I still think he was about 13, a young boy crying and bleeding. And I rushed over to him and he said his ribs were broken. And I said, "Maybe we better get the police," and he said the police did this to him, and he said they regularly did it to him. It came a lot from a queer activist sensibility that he had. He knew that young people were being kicked out of their homes and they needed a place to be. That also applied to the people who were being kicked out of drug treatment programs because they used. It also applied to people who were being released from prison. It also applied to people who were being discharged from hospital and had nowhere to go. It applied to people who were transgender, who were being kicked out. It applied to people who were just poor. They had nowhere to go, and Hank wanted them to have a place to go, and so he created a place for them to go. It was Hank's vision of what could be, of what was possible. What if we say that everyone has a right to have a place to live. No matter what their problems are, no matter how difficult it might be, let's try. Let's give people a chance. He said, "Well, Jerry, why don't you come and live here?" And so he let me coast for two months, and it was just really wonderful. He just was so kind and sweet, and he liked my sense of humor. I still am in that same room, and I always thank him for that in my prayers, in my heart. I'm glad to be inside. A lot of the residents who lived there were transgender people who were outcast from somewhere, that were looking for a place to live to have peace and to have community. So here's a building with 150 rooms. That's like a neighborhood. The manager before me was Donna Lisa Stewart. It was a dump. Hank did as much as he could. He buys sell out furniture and stuff like that, and he made sure there was a bed and a dresser or something in the rooms. We had a lot of drug addicts, a lot of drug abuse. Hank did not hold those things against people. He wasn't that kind of person. Now if he found out you were dealing drugs out of the hotel, you had hell to pay with Hank. You didn't wanna backstab Hank Wilson because he just didn't have time for it. He didn't have time for the pettiness. The desk clerks at night would charge $5 if the hookers would bring a trick in. I guess you could say we were an active whorehouse for a while. It was quite active. We had death threats, all kinds of threats in there. That's the main reason I didn't wear much makeup behind the desk and everything. People come in, "Faggot." A couple of times, I'd jump over that desk and beat the hell out of somebody. I wasn't about to back down in that place. Believe me, I was not gonna back down. Neither would Hank. You don't have to get physical with people, just outsmart 'em. That was Hank. Now I watched him do that a couple of times. Freaked me out. I'd rather punch 'em out. Hank had a way of handling people like nobody I ever saw. I mean, one guy was standing in there with a knife one time, I had already called the police, and Hank actually talked to him, walked him out the door, you know? And the police came and got him and took him away, but to me, you know, to me, I don't think Hank was afraid of him to tell you the truth. I really don't think. I think he was just protecting the other people in the lobby. You had people who were outraged last night, and they were outraged at the verdict. They were outraged at being kicked out by their families, having to migrate to San Francisco. They're outraged at violence, our own people being beaten up. Young people in the high schools being traumatized. I think that Harvey himself would put it in the total perspective, the violence against gay people. Harvey's death was nothing new. We've had violence against us for hundreds of years. It hasn't even been reported in the media. It continues to this day. I think more people will think about, why have gay people migrated to San Francisco? It was the first news report. That first day, I went to the medical library. I was trying to think what was it the gay guys were doing that maybe differentiated us from straight guys. I had the experience of going through the first epidemiologic reports at UCSF. I called the researchers at San Francisco General, and I wanted to know, what did they find out about us? They were having large numbers of gay guys who were telling about their sex lives, their drug lives, and we were trying to get clues. And so I called up and I found out that they had not processed the questionnaires yet because the grant, the government funding hadn't come through. They were waiting for the money. And I went out to the, I met the researcher, went out to his office, and I saw a pile of questionnaires, it was about a foot and a half high, sitting on his desk. And I said, "Well, what did you learn?" and he told me, "We haven't started yet." And I'm thinking like, "Yeah, well we've started falling like..." You know, we're falling apart. Some people have already died, other friends are getting sick, and we need clues. So I talk to the researcher Dr. Moss, Andrew Moss, into letting us go through the questionnaires and do data processing. So within two weeks we rounded up dozens of data processors from the gay community, and at night we put all the answers into the computer. And now I'd like to introduce you to Hank Wilson, co-founder of the Butterfly Brigade, community found community activist Hank Wilson. Today our community is facing a crisis of AIDS, and we say there's a conspiracy of silence. How many of us as gay men have had sex with men that have had AIDS? How many of us are lovers of men that have AIDS? How many of us have played sexually with men that have had AIDS? And how many of us have ever been asked by any government officials to be involved in research projects, to come forward and give information? That's important. We need to ask ourselves, what might we do today that would help us get through this crisis? 10 years from now, we don't wanna look back and say, "Gee, in 1983, we had some hopes. We thought the government was going to do some things for us." We don't wanna look back 10 years from now and remember our friends and our lovers, our roommates that might not be here. On the night of the White riot, we came here because Dan White got American justice. And when the first window was broken, I said, "Thank you." And that was for the time I was called a sissy. And when the second window was broken, I said, "Thank you." And that was the time when I was chosen last at PE. And when the first police car was burned, I said we could declare victory and leave. Nine cop cars later in flames, and we knew that the world, the world would watch, and young people all over the world, on the front pages of newspapers and on television they saw something: gay people. Lesbians came out angry. Today faced with AIDS, we're coming out loving. We're coming out supportive. We're coming out nurturing. We're coming out grieving. AIDS is causing homophobia to surface. It's not new, it's been there all the time, but it's an opportunity for those people who are homophobic to vent, and I'm ready for them because we can handle it. We can handle it. We did it during the Briggs campaign. We'll do it again. The answer is in us. We're ready to go forward. We just need to look around. The call will come out in the future, and when it does, if one of us stands up and says, "I need help," let's look around and let's go to that person's help, and if we do that, we'll pass the test. Power's working, there's hot water, and we're here. Once a teacher, Hank Wilson is the manager of the hotel, has been here since 1978 and is affectionately known as Mr. Ambassador Hotel. We made a conscious decision to work with people with AIDS early on, and that was especially important because other agencies wouldn't work with people that had substance abuse and alcohol problems. We had people here who were very sick, who were bed bound, who needed attendants, and we couldn't get support for them. At the same time, I had friends in other parts of the city that were just as sick and the same, basically in the same condition, that we're getting visiting nurses and accessing services in a different kind of way. That was often referred to as the quote, unquote, San Francisco model of HIV and AIDS care, which was developing and becoming pretty well known and supported, of course, and copied in other places, which was great for those people, but that model wasn't working for the population of people that we were dealing with at the Ambassador. It wasn't right, and it needed to change. And Hank was adamant about that. He refused to back down. He did not take no for an answer. And so we had to use a lot of different strategies and tactics. I've lost a lot of friends and family because of the fact that I have AIDS. So they have the people to replace that. I know that people really care and love you. Means a lot. They've disowned me. Your mom and dad disowned you? Yeah, even my best friends, they can't handle that I have AIDS, so they leave me alone. I'm sorry. Tell 'em to go to hell. Hell. Go to hell! This was the only hotel that would allow people that were known to be HIV positive to live. It was actually kind of like a mad house. There was usually one or two speed dealers on each floor, and, I mean, if everybody thinks they're dying, they said, "Well, let's damn the torpedoes and full speed ahead." And he tried to keep ahead of that mentality by showing kindness and forgiving people. He would try to calm it down, and he would be very, he'd wait until everybody had their say, and then he'd give, not the ruling, but he was pretty much fair to everybody, and he wouldn't punish anyone, he just, you know, he was just really, really kind. We lost so many people. It's absolutely impossible to remember. I remember their faces very well, their names not that well. There was absolutely no cure, nothing they could do for it. God, they would just disintegrate in front of you. In other words, that you'd have this healthy young man come in. One of the doctors that Hank knew would send them in and we'd give them a room, and within six months they were down to skeletons and dead. I can remember this, God, I can remember one. Hank checked a guy in from the hospital, and he left me a note to check on the guy, and I was busy and everything like that. And when I finally got the note, I went up to check on the guy and the guy had died. Hank checked him in, and the guy had died of AIDS the same day he checked into the hotel. I always felt a little guilty about that because I didn't get the note in time. I know there's nothing I could have done, but maybe I could have been there and held his hand or something because, believe me, Hank and I held a lot of hands. The worst day that Hank and I ever experienced in the Ambassador was the day that we'd lost five people to AIDS in one day. That day, it hit both Hank and I. We both cried. It was unbelievable. Reverend Glenda Hope who was our shoulder to cry on there when somebody passed away, she would do the eulogies, and Reverend Penny was her assistant. The street scene outside was pretty chaotic and pretty heartbreaking often, but walking into the Ambassador didn't change that. It was just like a continuation of the street. I can remember times when I conducted memorial services in that lobby, and Hank would somehow manage to get people quiet and respectful, and we would have a service that might go on for 15 minutes. And he would keep the right kind of order there, and then it would go back to being chaos, boom, like that. Folks who lived in the building really didn't have anybody in their life to remember them after they died, and so that was something that we felt was really important. No one should, no one should be, no one should die and not be remembered. Sometimes we had multiple memorial services in a short time, sometimes in one day. I was coming down and hearing about memorial services for so and so. Like you see, I just seen him the day before in the elevator, and then the next day he's gone. My brother just works two blocks away, and he's helped two of his friends that passed away. They died of AIDS, and he's telling me he doesn't wanna have nothing to do with my death because he can't handle it no more. Called in ambulance, and sometimes it take three and four hours for an ambulance to come because the ambulance drivers were afraid of it. The stigma that went with AIDS is so hard to explain to people that didn't live in the '80s, that didn't really see the deaths, the young people dying. People actually afraid to touch each other, which I thought was such a shame because some of them loved each other so much. One would get it, and the other one would have to take care of him until he died. And we went through so much of that. It was just unbelievable. The cruelty of people, the police included, was totally wrong 'cause people didn't deserve that. That's the way people treated them, like they deserve to die. And we dealt with that all the time, and it's something I just... I'm gonna have to stop. That it's. I can't go no more. If you met someone else who was gay and comfortable, that was rare, so we were all looking for that extended family. They found this place on Page Street. So we started to meet there, have different meetings. They had a dance, had poetry readings. That gave birth to that idea of the Valencia Rose. The Valencia Rose, I really loved that place. It was a real chance for marginalized entertainers. I played at the Valencia Rose a lot back in those days. There was a bunch of us. Whoopi started out there before she got her one-woman show in New York. Hank said, "What are you gonna do?" I said, "I don't know, maybe I'll do something like comedy. I mean, you always tell me I'm funny." "Yeah, well, fine. Do it." "Okay. When?" "How about this Saturday?" And if you were out and gay in those days in the comedy clubs, it was pretty terrible. You could make fag jokes if you were straight, but if you were a fag, you couldn't, and people threw things at you. It was amazing. Most lesbians at that time we're really centered and eating tofu, and their protest was an acoustic guitar, Holly Near, Meg Christian, Cris Williamson. You know, like that. And I was like, "Fuck you, fuck this, fuck this shit!" My ragefulness was so accepted by the community because everybody was dying, and people were getting incredibly upset. I mean, there was a lot of rage. What was going on in San Francisco, there was so much homophobia still, in San Francisco in the 1980s, yes, everywhere, and we were there talking about it. Now only just talking about it, people were flocking. It almost became a community center. I think Ron liked that and Hank liked that. And so the damn thing grew, and I think a lot of people were inspired by it. And some people came and they were shocked by it. They didn't like it 'cause they were not as out, it made them uncomfortable, and they go, "You're telling our secret." I mean, we heard everything. It was the best. Alec used to come every Monday to gay open mic comedy and sit with a group of high school kids because it was, the Valencia Rose was a cafe, not a bar, so young people could come, which was also a really important thing, right? 'Cause gay youth had nowhere to be. I've never ever seen artistic, political, queer community come together in the way that it did at the Valencia Rose. Never seen it since. They were truly one of the first places to open the door to people with AIDS. They were always there. It was always fundraisers. It was always something. People acted erratically and lost all compassion when it came to AIDS. It really needed to be talked about. We fucked our own community in the beginning. It took a few leaders to step up front. Hank stepped right up. The city wouldn't deal with us. They said, "We don't have any money. All of our money is being spent in the Castro. We don't have any money for the Tenderloin." We had to get some money and have a needs assessment done and all this to try to pressure the city. We actually ended up, and Hank was a part of this, having to do a sit in, and calling the press to see this, in the office of the director, the director of the Department of Public Health, in order to get something going in the Tenderloin. And ultimately we did. Meanwhile, Hank said, "Y'all are moving too slow for me." There's something has to be done right now. The next thing I knew, Hank himself was up on the roof of Burroughs welcome, the place headquarters because now all of a sudden we did have one drug that people with AIDS could have, but it was so expensive. And there he was on the evening news, protesting the cost of this drug, which, of course, our people could not possibly afford being arrested, so we pulled together, get another meeting, and the Tenderloin AIDS Network said we better speed this up because Hank is just kicking our butt here. I said, "Aren't you worried what's gonna happen?" He goes, "No, I think I'll be fine." And then he told me he got one of the very first symptoms, was something, it was horrible, called, I mean, the name alone, hairy leukoplakia. I probably mispronounced it. And I said, "Well, where is it?" "It's on my tongue." "Well, can I see it?" "No, Dr. Owen does that." "My God. Are you gonna die?" Kim Cosaro who was running a gay newspaper at the time, "Bay Times," called me up crying because we really felt it was a death sentence. That was it. And that had happened fast. And it did. People went blind. You saw them on Thursday. They went blind on Saturday. And they were dead, you know? It was bad. But again, you would not... Hank would refuse to be defeated by that. In fact, it got him even more charged up. I started worrying about him, and with Hank Wilson, you don't worry about him. But anyways, so I'd mentioned, "Don't you think you oughta take a rest? Don't you, you know, you know?" And whatever he'd have in his hand, "Shut up." You know, stuff like that. He didn't tell people when he was in pain. He never complained. You didn't know because he was, this is just the way he carried himself. And Hank would listen to Dr. A and listen to Dr. B, and then spend six hours in the medical library studying for himself. He had the same doctor that I had, and they fought. He would go in and tell the doctor, "I'm not doing that. By the way, have you seen this treatment, you know, you have to burn yourself?" I said, "Well, no wonder the doctor's pissed at you, Hank. For God's sake, you're talking voodoo." But see, everyone was so desperate. He went into the hospital, and everybody thought, "He's not coming out." We all were like preparing for the worst then. Dammit if he didn't spring right back. TARC was place that tested people to see if they were HIV positive, you know, not in the so-called gay community. It was more in the community of the Tenderloin, are like what would be like the poor section of town. I had started volunteering, or maybe interning, at TARC, the Tenderloin AIDS Resource Center, and Hank ran the community center, Hank ran the drop-in. And so I met Hank because Hank was the one to open the doors in the morning, and then Hank was like the pin ball in the pinball machine, bouncing around and meeting everyone's needs. I sort of learned how to do that job and how to not run away crying every day by watching Hank and letting him sort of guide me and teach me. 300 people on average a day came in and out of that drop-in center. It was so busy all the time. I was so new to the work, had no idea what I was doing, and I just tried to watch Hank and do as Hank did. And when I tried to do that, I saw that it was really basic. It's about just doing the job that needs to be done in front of you, treating everyone with an equal level of dignity, and not getting your ego wrapped up in the work. He would knock heads with upper management but there was also nothing they could do because like, what are you gonna do, fire Hank? Like, you can't fire Hank. Like the entire drop-in center would have erupt in protest. And who would run it? No one would be able to run it. The executive director of the organization would kind of come into staff meetings and say, "We're gonna stop doing this and that," and, "We need more structure," or, "We're cutting these services. We're not gonna do this anymore." And so, yes, Hank would turn to me and just say, "We're not changing anything that we've been doing. We're doing what we're doing." I was wandering down Golden Gate Avenue, and I saw Tenderloin AIDS Resource Center. And I said, "Hey, this looks like a really cool spot, and I was wondering if you guys are looking for any staff at the moment." And this is just classic Hank. He decides to interview me on the spot, takes me upstairs, we sit down at a table. I can tell he's enjoying my answers. He's very excited because he, Hank, as everybody who knows him, knows he just wears it on his face. There's no secrets around that. So I go back in and I get the interview, and they offered me the position. Didn't quite pay enough for me to moved to San Francisco, the economy, the rents, et cetera, so I was like, "That's a little low." So then I get the email from Tom saying, "Hank wants you take his job, and he's gonna take the lower paying job." And I'm like, I said this before, I really know Hank, but I'm like, I can tell he's like, and I'm like, "No, no way." I was like, "I love that guy." I did not want to take his job. And I ended up being the supervisor. He would do things like take people to the hospital even though that was not supposed to happen. You find out later that there was a car and Hank was driving it and a person was taken to the hospital 'cause they were really sick and they weren't going there. And there was no bus tokens. There was no cab fare. There was just Hank's ambulance taking people there. So those things like that, that happened with amount of regularity that our supervisor may not always appreciate. You know, you've got this admiration for his compassion, but you're also seeing, like, "You're working with interns. Just to let you know, part of your job is modeling. And you know, we do want to show people that there are boundaries, and that boundaries have an actual meaning, and there's purpose behind having boundaries." I don't think he ever thought in terms of boundaries. This was a concept that didn't exist for him. Truly, there are people who kind of flaunt the boundaries and they have a tone of identity as flaunter. I don't think that was it either. I think that Hank responded to need and responded to the moment and he responded to the person. That's right. Everybody at TARC thought Hank was a saint because he was so giving. I mean, I seen times where he would come up out of his pocket and just give people cash to do what things that they needed. That was probably rule number one, was not to give the clients money, but he did it, he did it anyway. And I think he might've even gave some shelter to some folks too. I hear he had people sleeping in his car at Berry Street. I understand. Can you speak to that? Um. Hank called me up one day and asked me how I was, and I was all tied up in knots about something that was so trivial that I can't even remember what it was right now, but it was vexing me at the time. And so I vented for a while, and after I had carried on a sufficient amount, I finally said, "So Hank, how are you?" And I'll never forget, Hank said, "I'm fine, I'm fine. I mean, I have lung cancer, but I spent the last two days in the medical library reading up on it, and the interesting thing is that people with lung cancer don't think they have any rights because they're all smokers, so this'll be fun." And this was Hank's way. He always found the fun in whatever it was he was doing, even the fun in a lung cancer diagnosis. It was also his way that the first thing to do was to educate yourself. So he got a lung cancer diagnosis. He went straight to the medical library and spent two days reading. In very much the same way, that's when he read the first "New York Times" article about six gay men dying of an unusual disease. He went and spent the next few days in the medical library. It's unusual for someone to have lung cancer who's never smoked. People in Hank situation who had going right down to death's door with AIDS before the effective drugs came out got cancers in higher proportions than the rest of the general population, so hence lung cancer was part of all that. So lung cancer is not generally considered an AIDS complication, but in Hank's case, I think we can say that at the end of the day, Hank did die from AIDS. Hank said he wanted to go to home and die in his own bed. He did not want to die in the hospital. We said, "Okay, well, that means we have to buy you a bed. You don't have a bed." And honest to God, Hank said, "Well, okay, but don't spend a lot of money." So we bought him a bed, and he went home to die in his own bed. And he got signed up for home hospice care and the care was terrible. And his nurse, his visiting nurse, would not approach his bed. She would stand on the far side of the room. It was clear that this nurse was not comfortable giving care to somebody who had AIDS, which was crazy because this was late in the day in the AIDS epidemic. It was really quite shocking. And so he ended up back in the hospital and did not want to resume the home hospice care. So we tried to get him a bed in a hospice facility and that bed never opened up. He died in the hospital waiting for a hospice bed that never came. Here was a man who had provided hospice care to hundreds of people, hundreds of people who couldn't pay for it, and yet he died in a hospital that he didn't want to be in, waiting for a hospice bed that never became available. It's not surprising that Hank's last days weren't quite what they should have been. Many of his friends didn't know how close to death he was. He spent a lot of hours alone in the hospital. I know I'm not the only person who feels like there was a thank you that I wanted to say to Hank before he died, that never really got said, and that's why we're making this movie. I don't think Hank would want to be called a saint. If you call somebody a saint, then you're kind of saying, "Well, this person is different, and the rest of us couldn't possibly do what he did." The kind of thing. Couldn't be that compassionate. Couldn't be that forgiving. I don't think Hank would ever want that. I think Saint Hank was a saint, but I understand what Glenda's saying, but he was the kind of saint that in that invited you in rather than setting himself apart. And he wasn't a saint because he tried to be a saint, that's the thing. There was no identity around that. It was the immediacy of the moment and his ability to impact that man, and then he invited other people into that, can you see this too? And that to me was so extraordinary that I would call him extraordinary enough that saint is as good a term as anything for him. From the north, I call to the spirit of the Earth, protector of the land and all who inhabit it. Bring us and watch over those who do not have roofs over their heads. Guide us all to safe havens. Remind us of the basic dignity of all human beings, no matter their circumstances. In the name of the spirit of the Earth, we, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, declare Hank Wilson the patron saint of housing justice. The patron saint of queer underdogs. Patron saint of plague survivors. Patron saint of of compassionate action. Thanks to Hank. Thanks to Hank. Thanks to Hank. Thanks to Hank. Thanks to Hank. Thanks to Hank. Dear Hank, the running joke is that you wouldn't want this movie to be made about you, just like you wouldn't want us to call you a hero or a saint but it has such a nice ring to it, Saint Hank. And for those of us who watched and worked alongside of you, it rings true. And we need to remember people like you, Hank. We have to talk about you. There are so many stories of greed and selfishness and of our communities being done wrong too. There are so many people who work for the spotlight, and so few who worked like you. You only worked out of love. That was the source of your labor and your service and your joy. I remember when I first learned you were a legend. I read about you in a book and told you about it the next day. You chuckled and waved it away and kept on sweeping the floor. Thank you, Hank. Love, Stephanie. Dear, dear Hank, you didn't know that I would still be in the same building that you led me in when I had no money to pay. I was a mess and that I probably definitely had a substance abuse problem that I was hiding on the down low. And you still gave me jobs and worked with me and would always introduce me to everyone that you were talking to that was in the room. You always made sure I was known to everyone. I just thank you for giving me a chance to try to remember to do that myself. Hank, I would like to thank you for the tireless work that you've done for the community. I'd like to thank you for your friendship. I'd like to thank you for your kindness. And I miss you.
