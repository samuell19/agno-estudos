[RANK GONG] They've been part of my life, the ships... ...and the river and the tides. As long as I can remember. It's what you might call inevitable, I suppose... ...because I was born and brought up in this part of Liverpool. Right on the waterfront. Almost among the docks. [TRAIN AND SHOUTING CHILDREN] Some people would call it a slum. Only I didn't think of it that way... ...when I was a little girl, in the year 1919. [KITCHEN NOISES] It's just on the boil. How is she? Is there anything else I can do? You're a good girl and your mother is going to be alright. [DOOR SHUTTING] It's unnatural to hate your own father, but I just couldn't help it. I shall never forget the last time I saw him. He came along to my school. Hello, Dad. Yer took your time about it little Nora, didn't ya? You're off to sea again? Now, look here - listen careful, Nora. I want you to give a message to yer ma. Tell her I've signed on a ship, only I... I'm sailing right away. We gotta catch the tide, see? - Aren't you going home first? - There's no time for that. - When will you be back? - It's a long trip. But tell yer ma, if she doesn't hear from me for a few months... Have you made out your allotment money for ma? 'Ere, you keep your place. A kid like you talking about allotment money. We've got to have something to live on while you're away. Have you arranged for Ma to get her money? Tell yer ma I'll send her a postcard and give her all the details. [SHIP'S HORN] Can't waste any more time now. And, uh, give my love to yer ma and to little Connie. - You're not coming back! - Ah, go on with yer! Peter McCabe's not the sort to be shipwrecked or washed overboard. [SINGING] My old man's a fireman... - Suppose you forget to write? - So long, Laura. You'll be a fine wench, when you grows up. [SINGING] He wears gawd blimey trousers and... You're not coming back! [STILL SINGING] He wears no blasted collar... Where's Ma to go to? Where will she get the money? Where will she get the money?! He didn't send a postcard, he didn't even send a sixpenny postal order. And I wondered if he knew when he went away... ...Ma was going to have a baby. [CRYING BABY] You've got a baby brother now. What about Ma? Oh, she's fine. She wanted a boy. Can I see her? Not yet - she's going to sleep. Here, when did you eat last? Connie and me had some bread and marge this morning... ...but... ...we're alright. Both of us. [KITCHEN NOISES] We're not hungry. You both go right away and get yourselves something to eat. Something hot, nourishing. Understand what I mean? And I'll see about you two girls... ...from tomorrow you'll be looked after. You're not going to take us away from Ma? Oh, no, she's a good mother, but she needs help just now. I help all I can, before I go to school in the mornings and when I get back. I'll look after the baby so Ma can go to work. She won't be able to do that for a bit. Now, away with you. If Ma lost her job, I don't know what'd happen to us. [CRYING BABY AND SHOUTING CHILDREN] - Has the baby come yet? - It's a boy. Connie! Connie! We've got a baby brother, and we're going to eat. Oooooo! That better, Ma? What are we going to call him? Peter, I suppose, same as his father. Oh, no, Ma, no! I won't let you! I know how you feel about him, love, but... after all, he is your father. And he always wanted a son. Any other name you like? Please, Ma, please! All right love, we'll think of something else. I know. We'll call him "George Alexander". That's a funny sort of name. I saw him once on the stage... ...The Royal Court, it was. Sir George Alexander. He was a wonderful actor. And such a handsome man. Handsome man! Handsome man! Be quite, Connie, and get down. You know Ma isn't well yet. It was the first time your father ever took me to the theatre. He'd rather have gone to a music hall. But he let me have my way. He wasn't sure I was going to marry him then. I wasn't sure myself. 'Ello there, George Alexander. When you grow up, you've got to be good to your ma. She must be proud of you... ...to make up for what Father did to her. It was a proud day for Mother and me, twelve years later, when that letter arrived. [FOOTSTEPS] Nora, come quick! Look what's come! It's got a coat of arms on it. We haven't been doing anything wrong, have we? How on earth did it get like that? Well, I wasn't to know the postman was coming, was I? It isn't as if we get many letters. There was I scrubbing the floor... ...and it came straight through the letterbox, into the bucket. Eee, I wonder what it could be? You don't think the rent's gone up, do yer? If it had the collector would tell you himself. Why not open it? I'm scared to. I've never seen one like this. It says here: "Corporation of Liverpool". "Pleased to inform you that your son, George Alexander McCabe"... ..."has been awarded a scholarship"... ..."tenable from September next"... - ..."at the..." - Eee, let me see! There's no doubt about it - this is a step up in the world for the McCabes. Eeee! Fancy our George Alexander wearing a college cap! I wonder how much they cost? It says here... ..."full maintenance grant in cases of proved necessity". Well that's us, isn't it? It would happen on a Saturday afternoon, when he's out playing football. Eee, we must give him a treat for his tea. Something tasty. I tell you what... George Alexander, what have they done to yer? Here, sit down. Who did it? A chap I know. He said, "there's some who have fathers alive"... ..."and some who have fathers what's dead"... ..."but some don't have any fathers at all." When a chap says things like that, you've got to go for 'em. I knocked one of his teeth loose. That's right George Alexander, you stick up for yourself. If anyone hits you, you hit back. What are you saying, Nora? Another beating like that and the boy'll be dead. Not him. Not our George Alexander. - Does it hurt love? - A bit. Look what's come. - Nora? - Yes, love? Why does he stay away so long? I know other chaps whose dads go to sea... ...but they always come back some time or other. But only real sailors like your father go on long voyages. San Francisco... to Shanghai and back. And then on to South America. Oh, it takes years and years. Now you read this. We'll celebrate this in style. I've got a quid saved up, and we'll blow it all tonight. Now, Ma - none of that. We'll go to the Empire, all of us. It'll be the best evening we've had for years. [SINGING] "Has anybody here seen Kelly? K.E.L.L.Y..." "Anybody here seen Kelly? Find him if you can." "He's as bad as old Antonio He's left me on my ownio." "Anybody here seen Kelly? Kelly from the Isle of Man." Come on, boys, all together, now! [AUDIENCE JOINS IN] [NORA LAUGHS] [EVERYONE SINGING - REPEATED CHORUS] [APPLAUSE, CHEERING] I do declare, George Alexander, nobody'd ever think you'd won the scholarship. - Say you're sorry to the gentleman - Oh, that's alright. But say it, George Alexander. I'm sorry. I'm thirsty as well. [CROWD NOISES] Now, what can I get for you? - We'll wait our turn, thanks. - You'll have to wait a long time. Oh, come on. I'm not just being fresh. I'm serious. Honest, I am. - Serious about what? - About getting you a drink. Somehow I don't think you'll be able to get one for yourself. Now, what's it to be? Double scotch for the young man? Large whiskey and soda please. Hey, that's enough of that. Don't you dare offer him whisky. No luck, me lad. It's lemonade for you. We'll all have lemonade. - That'll be... - I know. Four and one - five. Miss! [MUSIC, PEOPLE LAUGHING AND TALKING] Here you are, Ma. Shameless little... - Shameless little what, Ma? - Never you mind. [PEOPLE TALKING] - Connie. - Oh, really, Ma. As if I was a child! It's just what you are. Well, I never! And you telling me about making eyes at those boys. Well, fancy our Nora! Well, whoever he is, I'm sure he's very nice... ...or she wouldn't be speaking to him. Well, why shouldn't I enjoy myself too? Talking to one gentleman, like Nora there, is one thing... ...but making eyes at a whole pack of silly, empty headed young louts... ...is quite different. You know that feeling when something starts to happen... ...and you feel sure that you know what you're going to do next... ...even what you're going to say next? You mean, it all happened before? Oh, I don't know about that. But it's as if you know your destiny. And you're glad. Yes, I have felt that sometimes. Not often. Well, it's never happened to me before. It is now. It was a real bit of luck for me, coming here tonight. [BELL RINGING] Oh, there's the bell. I must go. - Oh, but there's plenty of time. - Oh no, there isn't. - Goodbye, Mr Satterthwaite. - I wish you'd call me "Ben". Alright. Goodbye, Ben. Well, when am I going to see you again? Don't suppose ever. Oh, but please - I'll wait for you. I'll see you after the show? But, please, I shan't have a chance of seeing you again... ...for three whole weeks. My ship sails tomorrow. - What's the matter? - So you're on a ship? Yes, a fine ship too. I'm the fourth engineer. Just come back from my first long trip. - Here today, gone tomorrow. - What do you mean? It's only that I have no use for sailors. I suppose some other sea-going chap let you down? You didn't get married to him, did you? Or engaged? You got it all back to front, mister. Well, I'm different. I'm not like this other chap, whoever he is... [MUSIC] He was different. And every time his ship docked... ...the minute he was off duty, he'd rush to see me. Well, I never! Ben Satterthwaite! - Well, you really come and go, don't you? - Just docked. I didn't expect you 'til next week. That's what you said in your letter. The minute the gang plank was fixed... ...I pushed everyone aside, including the captain... ...and came straight along here. To see me? Oh, no, just to see that the old Mersey was... ...still flowing in and out. Oh, well, I suppose I should be flattered... - ...the fourth engineer dashing ashore... - Third engineer, now. I've been promoted. [MUSIC] High tide. Low tide. And then high tide again. - Nothing can stop it. - Just as well. Otherwise there wouldn't be any docks, any ships, any Liverpool. And you and me. Every ship's got to catch the tide, you know? That's what my father said. What he meant was, he was going away and never coming back. You seem to take it out on me because of what your father did. It isn't fair, you know? I know, Ben. I know. Sometimes a thought comes to my mind and... ...and I just can't help it. Ma, can I finish the jelly? Yes, love, 'course you can. Anyway, you won't be getting married for a bit yet. It's not as if I was going to lose Nora right away. Well, um... ...as a matter of fact... ...I want us to get married the minute I come back from my next trip. I don't hold with long engagements. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] He didn't know. None of us knew then... ...that the slump was setting in. And now, the docks are at a standstill. Ships are idle. Thousands are out of work. My Ben's amongst them. It's been going on like this for two years. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hello, love. [BELL] I only saw one ship coming in this morning. Well, there were eight. Tried them all. Nothing doing. Just think... ...two whole years, a ship's engineer without a ship. [SHIP'S HORN] It's not going to last forever. There's a timber boat coming in tomorrow. As old as the ark. Diverted from Glasgow, so there's a chance others may not have heard about her. "Benediction", that's her name. "Benediction". Ben... Benediction. Ah, but don't you see? That's an omen. A good omen. Maybe we'll get married soon. Nora? There's something I've got to say. You remember when we first got engaged? Do you realise how long ago it was? Of course I do. All that time I've been out of a job. It's a rotten bad bargain for you. - Who says so? - I'm using up your life. Holding you, but can't marry you. If you feel... if you want... Ben Satterthwaite, what are you getting at? What I'm trying to say is this... Well, I don't and I won't, so there! I love you, and whatever happens I'm going to stick to you. [SINGING] Eee, that Mrs Gibson. She's at it again. Oh, well, she's only trying to liven the place up. It needs it. If her husband had any idea the way she carries on when he's at sea. Has Ben got a ship yet? - No. - Hey, don't worry - he will. And then you'll get married. And off he'll go, like the rest of 'em. Away for months on end. You won't like it, you know? You'll be lonesome. What do you mean, Mrs Duncan? Mind you, I was just the same meself before I got married. Always thinking how nice it'd be... ...to have someone to cuddle up against. Don't know that I've learnt better since. I must fly now. Goodnight, Mrs Duncan. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [SINGING] - Evening, Mrs Simon. - Disgusting - that's what it is. Boozing. - And always with some man or other. - Noise. - We'll have to complain to landlord. - No, no - I don't want to see t'landlord. [DOOR OPENING AND SHUTTING] What's up? You gone off your rocker, Ma? There's a gentleman coming to see Connie. At least, he's going to take her out tonight. It's that Mr Bruno we've heard so much about. Oh, him. Where is Connie, anyway? Getting herself ready. So we've all got to turn the place upside down... ...just because Mr Morris Bruno is honouring us with his company. - You don't behave like this when Ben comes. - Don't be so daft. Ben's different. He certainly is. I mean, he's more like one of the family. It'll be the first time Mr Bruno's been inside the place. We must make a good impression. Eee, do you know, Nora... ...he even sent a telegram to say what time he was coming. It's up there on the mantlepiece. My heart nearly stopped beating when I opened the door... ...and saw telegraph boy staring at me. I knew it was too early for the Irish sweep. I thought somebody must be dead. - I wondered if... - If it might be Father. Isn't it about time you gave up hope of ever hearing from him again? Eee, I've never dusted that mirror. I'll do it. Right love, well, I'll go and tidy up a bit. You know... ...I think Mr Bruno's serious about Connie. Otherwise he wouldn't call on her at her home and send a telegram. He's the sort who makes use of mirrors. You make me sick, Nora. Jealous, that's what you are! Just because my boyfriends are smart and make money. - Not like... - Oh, give over. Tell you what, Nora, you've got no taste. Got no savvy, either. What do you want to hitch yourself up to a ship's engineer for? - With all this unemployment, too. - You leave my Ben alone! Oh, I wouldn't have him if he was offered me on a plate. Stop it, you two. [KNOCKING AT THE DOOR] [FOOTSTEPS] - Hello. - Oh, none of that now! - Oh, give over! - What's biting you, eh? Remember we're in my home now, Morris Bruno. This is my mother. Delighted, I'm sure. How do. That's my other daughter, Nora. Oh, hello. We've already met. Oh, that's the old man, isn't it? Yes, that's my husband. Perhaps Mr Bruno would like a cup of tea? No, thanks. - It's just ready. - All the more for you, then. Connie told me about him. Very sad for you, but... ...after all, a hero's death. A captain must go down with his ship. That's the tradition of the sea, as they say. Time we got a move on, isn't it? That's right, you'd better be powdering your nose, sweetheart. I won't be a sec. [SINGING] Nice bit of cloth, isn't it? Smart cut, too. You might almost say I designed the suit myself. Oh, you've got to dress well in business, you know. What business are you in, Mr Bruno? Marine insurance, that's my line. Oh, fancy. - Nora's young man, he's a ship's engineer. - Oh. Oh, I uh, I don't have anything to do with that side of it. Freight, that's what I deal in. Got a nice little agency. Seems to me the only people who get on these days are loud-mouthed swankpots. Are you trying to pass any nasty insinuations, Nora McCabe? 'Course she isn't, Connie. What an idea! Nora never meant anything at all. You see, Ben's one of the unemployed... ...and all this time Nora and Ben have been waiting... ...to get married. Well it gets on the nerves, you know? "Other people's troubles are no concern of Morris Bruno." That's my motto. Here, I've got something for you. Present for a good little girl. Couple of tickets for the Empire, tomorrow night. Best seats in the house, these are. - Oh, I thought you and me was going? - I changed me mind. I'll take you for a real drive instead, eh? Take your fiance - give him a treat. - No, thank you. - Nora. - It's very kind of Mr Bruno. - I don't want them. Take 'em or leave 'em, it's all the same to me. Right, Connie? Then it's time we stepped on the gas. So long, folks. [DOOR OPENING AND SHUTTING] And that is good shuttance to bad rubbish. Well, since he's not staying to tea, we'll take the best cloth off. Our George Alexander's very late tonight. [CHILDREN SHOUTING] Hey, clear off! Come on, get out of it! Come on, push off! Eee, what a wreck. What's it supposed to be? Bet it don't go! An old boneshaker. [WOLF WHISTLE] Making a mess of my car! Go on, clear off. Clear off yerself. You call that a car? [NOISE OF CAR DRIVING AWAY] [WOLF-WHISTLING, SHOUTING] - Hello, Ma. - Whatever's kept you so late? Oh, nothing. Well, hurry up and get your supper. I've got some swotting to do, this evening. It's Latin first period tomorrow. And if I don't know these irregular verbs... ...I shall be kept in. And I shan't be able to play for second team. And, so I suppose they'd lose the match? Women make me wild! [BIG BAND MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] Calm down, calm down. Don't come that on me. I know you're no iceberg. I'm not your property, either. I bring you out and I give you a good time... ...and what do I get in return? The pleasure of my company. And that's more than you deserve. [BAND MUSIC CONTINUES] [SEAGULLS CRY] [ALARM BELL RINGING] Oh, for the love of Mike - shut that blasted window! [WINDOW SHUTTING] Come on, up with you. You'll be getting the sack if you're late again at the shop. Oh, shut up. Get out of it. You're bone lazy - that what's you are. Who said I wasn't? Well, I'm not half so lazy as I'm going to be when I'm married. I shall lie in bed every morning. The ladies' maid to bring me a cup of tea. And breakfast in bed. No scrubbing floors and looking after dirty kids for me. Not when I marry Morris. Well, why not? He's not the marrying sort. You're not in love with him. Depends what you mean by being in love. You'd know - if it ever happened to you. Well I hope it never does if it means hitching myself up... ...to an out-of-work sailor. Oh, shut up. I'm sick of your beastly remarks. Oh, well. You'll always be poor, Nora. And as for him not being the marrying sort - you just leave that to me. I know how to handle him. Ooh, cold as ice! When you've got money you can afford thick carpets on the floor. Soft and warm. You know, the kind your feet sink into. Like they have in big hotels. I wouldn't know. I don't go to big hotels. No, of course you don't. You don't get asked out, do you? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SHIPS HORN] Hey, mister! - What do you want? - A job! - Nothing doing. - Any sort of a job! [SHIP'S HORN] Hey, you! The Captain wants to see you. Hey, McCabe. Look slippy about it. [FOOTSTEPS] - Peter McCabe? - Yes, sir. The Second Engineer is pressing the case, so I had to bring it up to you. Cappadocio. Skiros. Well, that must have been when Ned Rimmell was the master. Alice Hayes. Balkans. Been on the China run, too. Bangalore. Maid of Orleans. The man's got a good, long record. A few drunks. Well, hang it all, Chief... ...if the poor devils don't have a booze now and again they'd never stick the life. I think we ought to give him another chance. Put him back on firing the boilers for a bit. He won't like it, but it'll sweat some of the rebelly Irish out of him. - What do you say? - It's an idea, sir. I hate to part with a man when he's getting a bit... ...too old to find another ship easily. Come in, McCabe. [SHIP'S HORN] There you are, McCabe. There's your pay for the trip. Sign your name. Now listen to me, McCabe - we sail again tonight. That's okay by me, sir. But, er, I'd like to go ashore though. But I'll be back on board in good time - fit and sober. Come back and listen to me. I've had some bad reports about you, McCabe. You're insubordinate. You make trouble with the other men. You're a thoroughgoing "sea lawyer", that's what you are. I knows my job. I'll give you one more chance. Only one - understand? 'Ere, what are you getting at? When we sail tonight, you're no longer a greaser. You work in the stoke hold. It'll teach you a lesson. You behave sensibly this trip, I'll consider it again. Back to the furnaces, me? With my record! - I'll see... - Steady. There are plenty of younger men. Younger men? I've shot 'em. 'Ere, sign me book an' I'll get off your blasted hook as fast as ever I can. Trimming furnaces! Not that I've got nothing against you, Chief - or you, sir. I know you've only said what you're duty-bound to say. But I know who's got this in for me... ...yeah, 'an he'd better watch out for himself. [MUTTERING AND DOOR SLAMMING] [SOUND OF TRAINS] My own special little pet. Finished. Worn out. Only fit for the scrap heap. [HE SPITS] [CAR AND CROWD NOISES] - We'll have supper in Chester. - Oh! So we're going over the water? I'll take you the best place I know. [MUSIC] I'm not asking you in. You don't mind? - No. - It's only that I'm tired. You don't have to explain anything. [FOOTSTEPS] [MUSIC] Ma? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Nora. Why, I'd hardly have known yer. You go away an' leave a bit of a girl... ...an' yer come back and find a grown woman, eh? What's the matter? - Have you forgotten yer dad? - No. I haven't forgotten. If you're looking for yer ma, she's not here. I found the door open, so I just walked in. How is the old girl? - She's alright. - And er, and little Connie? You both working? Yes. Well, that's fine, isn't it? Why did you have to come back, after all this time? Well, you don't think I'd desert my wife and children, do yer? Of course not. You just forgot to write and send us your address. You just forgot to send any money to Ma. You just forgot, for fourteen years. Honest, I never thought it was as long as that. I know I've done you wrong, but I never meant to. Do you know, time and time again I... ...I saved up a bit of money to send to your ma but... ...oooh, I've had cruel bad luck, I have. I've been robbed, too. They put me in prison once. In Chile, that was. No fault of mine, either. I suppose you think it's been easy for Ma? Bringing up your kids on memories and promises. You're 'ard, Nora - that's what you are. Hard. But I didn't come home here to make a row. All I'm trying to tell you is... ...that I... I was born under a wandering star. I can't seem to settle nowhere. But now that you and little Connie are grown up... ...and earning your own living. Well, maybe you won't be needing me quite so much. But that's alright, don't worry. This is just a little, friendly visit. Well aren't yer going to give me a cup of tea? There's no place like home! I'm glad you kept this old armchair. Uh, this is the one my Aunt Kate gave your ma an' me when we was married. She was a funny old hag, she was. Do you know, I don't think she ever liked me much. I can't think why. Well, I never. 'Ere, you've collected quite a lot of new furniture. Well, I never did. My old razor case. And me razor in it, too. And not a speck of rust on it, either. Your old mum. Sentimental old girl, your ma is. Fancy her a-keeping this for me all them years. When do you expect her home? Not before you've gone, I hope. You won't get round her this time. I still remember the way you used to come home drunk and make Ma cry. 'Ere - you shut your trap! You may think yer grown up... ...but I'm still your dad and I'll have you treat me respectful. Too much lip, altogether. That was a terrible thing to say to yer own father. What?! I haven't had a drink all day. 'Ere, smell my breath. A reformed character. Ah, c'mon. Why not let bygones be bygones and let's enjoy ourselves while we can? I tell you what. I'm feeling a bit tired, so... ...I'll pop in there an' have a lie down on your mum's bed, an'... ...when the old girl comes home... ...then we'll all pop down to the pub and have one before we turns in. Heh, heh! You don't think you're going to sleep in there! 'Ere! What's that got to do with you? Well, you won't! She's forgotten you! You're nothing to her now! You're not even to touch her! You beastly swine! Call your father a swine, would yer? [CRYING] That's gratitude for the good home I've given yer. Swine, am I?! I'd rather die than stay in this cold-hearted hole! Swine, am I? If there's any justice, my curse'll blast the light out of your eyes. [CRYING AND SLAMMING OF DOOR] Oh, it isn't right - is it now? For a lady to be drinking - all on her lonesome? That's soon put right. [MUSIC] I see yer got, er, two glasses there. I must have known you were coming. [STOPS GRAMOPHONE] Them's the first kind words I've had said to me today. [DRINKS BEING POURED] Your very good health, ma'am. And to you, sailor. Oh, that's a lovely drop of scotch. - "A Broken Doll". - Would you like me to play it for you? Many's the time I've heard Karen Smain take the roof off with that one at the Empire. [SINGING] "You called me 'baby doll' a year ago." "You told me I was very nice to know." "I soon learnt what love meant, I thought"... Well thanks, Mrs Duncan! - It was nice of you to ask me in. - You're welcome. I do enjoy a cup of tea. I daresay Nora will be home by now. [SONG HEARD FAINTLY] [SINGING] "...'Cos when you go away" "You'll be sorry some day..." "You left behind a broken doll." [LAUGHTER AND SINGING] [SINGING] ..."after all. 'Cos when she's gone away"... ..."you'll be sorry some day." "You left behind a broken heart." [LAUGHTER] You know my dear, you've got a remarkably fine voice. Have I, love? Have I? To turn your own father out. Nora, how could you? It's no use, Ma. I can't pretend. As soon as I saw him standing there, I... All the same, blood's thicker than water. Look, Ma. You've got to be firm about this. As like as not he's in the pub by now. But he might land back here any minute. And if you're soft with him, if you let him get round you. Well, I'm scared for you. He never really had a chance, poor Peter. Taken away from school, and sent to sea... ...before he was George Alexander's age. But you wouldn't understand about that. Now, don't you go changing your mind again. Come on, Ma. But where'll we go? We'll find somewhere. Oh, I wish Ben wasn't down at the docks. Looks as if we'll have to use these tickets, after all. First house. We'll be in time if we get a move on. It's a blessing George Alexander's out at that school debate tonight. We'll collect him on the way back. [OPENING AND SHUTTING DOOR] You know, I knew you was a good sort the second I set eyes on yer. Yer did? Oh! And handsome, too. You know, you don't often see a figure like that these days. Skin and bone, most of 'em. Like hairpins. Oh, well, here's to my figure, then. This drop of whisky's doing me a power of good. You know, if I'd had just a couple of minutes... ...with that stuck-up stink of a second engineer... ...I'd have made a proper mess of him. He had it in for me from the start. Chucks me on the shore... ...just when every man in the dockyards is looking for a ship. Mind you, I'm just as good a man as ever I was. You don't see muscles like that every day of the week. 'Ere, you feel them biceps. [GIGGLING] Don't you giggle, woman. Them muscles means hard work. I bet you're a terrible man when your temper's up. But never with a lady, I've never raised me hand to a woman in me life. Not that I haven't had provocation, mind you. Now take my daughter, Nora. Oh, never mind. You know your onions, don't you? I bet you don't get kisses like that... ...from a pen-pushing landlubber. - Fond of me, sailor? - 'Course I'm fond of yer. I tell you what the trouble is with Nora. She's a bit above herself. Never gave me a chance to make friends, she didn't. I'm a rough diamond, but... ...I've got a soft heart underneath. Do you know I was almost in tears when you started to sing that song. Were you, love? Were you? It might all have been different if the old girl had been at home. Or Connie, instead of Nora. Connie was just a nipper when I went away. But I could see then that she took after her dad. We'd get along together fine. Well, what about your son? You haven't said anything about him yet. Don't you try to be funny or I'll fetch you a fourpenny one! I've got no son. Hoo! I must be off my head then. Why, all day long I see him running up and down the stairs out there. Only this afternoon he was going off to play in a football match, he was. 'Ere, what are you getting at? My name's Peter McCabe 'an... ...that's my wife and daughters what live upstairs. I know nothing about no boy. 'Ere. How old would he be..? Fourteen, or thereabouts. What's his name? George Alexander. By the livin' hokey, it's true, then! George Alexander. I remember she always said that if she had a boy... ...she'd call him after that actor chap. I've got a son. It's funny that Nora didn't tell you herself, isn't it? I've got a son. Maybe she had a reason! What reason? Well... you know how long you've been away. I only gave you the boy's age approximate. Maybe he isn't fourteen? 'Ere! I'll have you know my wife's a respectable woman. I wouldn't have her mentioned, not in the same breath as you! Bilker! Dirty, rotten bilker! [FOOTSTEPS AND DOOR SLAMMING] [BANGING ON THE DOOR] Let me in! Let me in, will yer? I... I only want to see my boy. I don't mean no harm to no one. If you're there, son, let me in. It's only yer dad, home from sea. Only yer old dad. [BANGING ON THE DOOR] Let me in! [PIANO PLAYING AND CROWD NOISES] A double whisky, quick. Haven't you had enough, mate? Enough? I don't know the meaning of the word. Come on! Get a move on, will yer? I'm not asking for credit. There you are. Help yerself. This is to drink the health of my son. Hmm. You'd be wiser to go home, cool off and see your wife. 'E's got no wife! [PIANO STOPS PLAYING] I've seen his papers. He makes no family allotment out of his pay. What do you say to that, my own special little pet, eh? Hey! It's his son's birthday. He must have a missus somewhere? Sure he has. One in every port. What'll yer have? 'Ere, 'ere! Come outside. You think I'd fight a worn-out old runabout like you? Boozed up to the eyes into the bargain? I'm gonna give you a bashin'. You're not simply drunk - you're paralytic! The ship's well rid of you! [CROWD NOISES] [MORE CROWD NOISES AND SHIP'S HORN] [SOUND OF RUNNING] [LAUGHTER] You've asked for it. Now you're gonna get it! [SOUND OF FIGHTING] [LAUGHTER] [SOUND OF PUNCHES] [CAR HORN] [BUS BELL] Pretty wasn't it, that ballet dancing? Mind you, I've seen better. That foreign dancer. What's her name, er, Pavlova - doing the swan dance. You know, the one where the swan dies. And she flutters her arms. And falls down all in a heap. And the music gets quieter and quieter. And then her 'ead falls. And you know she's dead. Fairly used to make me cry, that did. I saw it at the old Empire, with your father. 'E didn't care for it, I remember. 'Eee! My goodness - I've just remembered! Connie! She doesn't even know he's back. She's too full of that greasy Morris Bruno to bother about anything else. Sometimes, Nora, I don't understand you. After all, it was Morris gave us the tickets. Ought to be ashamed of yourself. I didn't want to take them. Nothing would have made me, but for... [DANCE MUSIC] Champagne! I am having some new experiences tonight, aren't I? That's right, sweetheart - you are. Now, drink it up. What's the hurry, anyway? That's the only way to get the taste of it. I was... keeping it as a special surprise. We're going to look in on some friends of mine. They've got a nice, little house. They know we're coming, I suppose? As a matter of fact, they may be away. They gave me the key. Told me to use the place as if it was my own. I'll, um... I'll mix you a special kind of cocktail. Perhaps not. It, um, might be too strong for you. Oh? I can drink any cocktail that ever was made. "Try anything once." - That's my motto. - Are you sure you're not scared? Scared? I can keep you in your place, Morris Bruno! Well, perhaps you won't always want to? [PIANO PLAYING] Night, Joe. Night. And it's going to get worse, I tell you. Ah, what are you grousing about? You're cushy with your back stuck up against yon boiler thing. That patent tea urn cost a lot of money, I tell yer. Aye, but you've got a job. Oh, aye! I'm making me fortune, I am. Dishin' out tea 'ere at a penny a cup. Can't even sell a rock cake these days. Well, what can you expect with two million unemployed? Well, there's one more from this afternoon. I signed on at the Exchange today. Is that what put that smile on your face? And what's more, I'd do it again. What's life without freedom? Anything's better than serving under the worst slave-driving... ...bucko of a shipmaster that ever sailed the seven seas. You wouldn't mean Hargest, would yer? Old platter-faced Hargest? You know him? Know him! He had me out once with the holy-stone... ...in the middle of a bay, in a gale that would blow the teeth out of your head! - Hargest, I've heard of him. - Aye, he's a blackguard. I cannae blame ye for getting out of his clutches. 'Ere, come on, I've drawn me back pay - I'll stand you. - Tea and a slab of scoff, twice. - Right. - What about you, chum? - Er, no, thanks. Oh, I might have noticed you was wearing a posh hat. What might you be? Ship's officer? - Used to be. - Well I used to be a deckhand, see! - And now we're both on shore... - What ship are you talking about? - Why? - I want that job. Don't talk wet, mister! You heard me say it was a deckhand's job. Och, if you sign on with Hargest he'll flay the skin off your back. I'll take anything he can hand out. Come on. Where is she? Where's she docked? - I've got to get work, I tell yer! - She's not docked anywhere, mister. She sailed this morning, for China. [LAUGHTER] [ENGINE NOISES, AMBULANCE BELL] - Accident? - No, murder! You're a bit late. They've just taken the corpse away. Look, you can see the blood on the road. Had his throat cut, poor devil. With a razor. Ship's engineer, he were. Ship's engineer? How'd you know? We had some of the officers here from the ship, identifying the corpse. That ship over there, it were. Oh, thanks! Thanks very much! Funny sort of chap. Doesn't seem to be interested in murder. I saw McCabe with my own eyes, going off in a black maria. He had handcuffs on him, too. Chief Engineer anywhere about? Or was he the one who, er... - No, that was the Second. - Well, it's the Chief I want to see. - Down there. - Right, thanks. - Want me? - I'm looking for a ship. You need an engineer. Your Second is... Alright, you don't need to tell me - I know. - Horrible business. - Yeah. Were you there? No, I saw the ambulance driving away, that's all. You're pretty smart on the job. The chap hasn't been dead more than fifteen minutes. Well there it is - you need an engineer, and I'm on the spot. Can't be done. I know nothing about you. And I haven't got time to find out. Ship's due to sail at midnight. We don't, we may miss the tide. Then the police may delay us with all sorts of inquiries. Look. Here are my papers. If I'm a dud, you can put me ashore at the next port of call. - But I'm not a dud. - I don't believe you are. Can you give me half an hour to collect my kit? You're mighty keen, aren't you? Keen... you don't know how keen I am. Nora, what can this be? - It's from Ben. - 'Eee. It gave me quite a turn. Oh! Ben's got a ship! He's just signed on. Third Engineer. He'll be sailing tonight. He'll be gone by now. And I wasn't there to say goodbye to him. Does he say how long he'll be away? No, but he says he'll write as soon as he can. That's the best bit of news we've had for I don't know how long. Ben'll have money now and you'll be able to get married soon. Goodnight, Ma. Goodnight Nora. Goodnight, love. Nora, see to the fire for me. I'm going to make some cocoa. I feel quite chilly, all of a sudden. It just shows you never know when your luck's going to turn. [MUSIC] Ben... Benediction. It was a good omen. [SOFT MUSIC] Go on - pour it out. I'm taking only one, remember. I daresay one will be enough. Oh, that's nothing. Not a bad cocktail at all. Happy days! [SOFT SINGING] "When evening lights were low, when stars began to glow." "I'd go around to see my lovin' baby." "He was my only thing. He was my life, my dream." Here, that's enough of that! [SINGING CONTINUES] "...But he broke my heart..." What's the matter? N... n... nothing. Nothing's the matter. Everything's fine. Oh, it's so close in here. Oh. Why don't you go upstairs and lie down a bit, eh? Till you feel better. Alright. You stay here. [SINGING CONTINUES] You thought you'd been having me on, smart boy. But I knew what you were up to. I knew all the time. [SINGING] "Hear my heart a callin'. While my tears are fallin'." "Won't you listen to my plea?" "There's no if, no maybe." "I'm your one and only baby. Come..." [CONNIE - UPSTAIRS] Switch it on again. But not so loud. [SOFT SONG REPLAYS] [MUSIC] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Is that you, Connie? Does Mrs Peter McCabe live here? I'm sorry to disturb you, miss - at this time of night. Come in. What is it, Nora? What does he want? Are you Mrs Peter McCabe, ma'am? Yes. Was your husband employed on a ship called... The Benediction? I've no idea what he was on. - What did you say? What name? - Benediction, miss. I'm, er, afraid I shall have to ask you a few questions, madam. Your husband has been arrested. On a charge of murder. [SOUND OF COAL BEING SHOVELLED] I never did speak ill of the dead... ...but that engineer... ...I hated his guts. The same as everyone else did on this old hooker. Aye, maybe we ought to send a vote of thanks to old McCabe? [LAUGHTER] Hey, what's the matter with him? Looks as though he's going to heave his stomach up any minute now. Hey, mister - what's up? What's biting yer? You get on with your work. There's no harm is there? Talkin' about an old pal who's down on his luck? He might have been a shipmate of yours, once! Never set eyes on him. - Well, how're you getting on? - Alright. Isn't it time we got more speed on? We must be out at sea by now. Nah, we're heading the other way. What do you mean? Up the river - towards Manchester. Change of plan. [NOISE OF SHOVELLING COAL] [PUB PIANO MUSIC] Waterfront murder! Waterfront murder! And what's the good of hiding from plain facts? A drunken murderer. Well, that's all he is. A nice man to have for a father. You think I don't know what all the girls at the store will be saying about me? [KNOCKING ON THE DOOR] I'll be lucky if I don't get the sack. Mrs McCabe? Good morning. The Sunday Messenger will pay fifty pounds for an article. Er... We'll write it for you. Fifty quid just for talking to a man for half an hour? Go on, Ma - you take it. But Ma, you'll never get another chance like this. All you got to do, Mrs McCabe, is just sign that form and leave the rest to us. No, thank you. Will you please go and leave my mother alone? Go, I tell you! Please go. All right, all right. There's no need to get upset. In case you change your mind, Mrs McCabe... ...that address will always find me. Thank you, good luck. See you later, Ma. [PIANO MUSIC] There y'are, what did I tell yer? Lets the whole neighbourhood down. Poor Mrs McCabe. It's terrible hard on her. Nora's the one who'll feel it most. After all, who'd want to marry the daughter of a murderer? Always had a feeling something like this was going to happen. Well, all I say is... ...if they've got fifty quid to chuck away we're as much entitled to it as anyone. After all, all kinds of people write about themselves in the papers. Countesses and them baronets. And no one thinks any the worse of them for it. And it won't hurt him. And he certainly owes us a bit. The number of times I've thought of throwing that 'orrible razor away. - Or selling it for a few shillings. - Bye, Ma. I've got a date with Morris tonight so I shan't be home till late. Only I didn't like to part with everything of his. And he'd taken all the rest with him when he'd cleared out. Even his dirty shirts. Bye, Ma. [SOUND OF TRAINS AND CARS] Yes? It's about my husband. I want to see him, please. Been taken up has he? What name? - McCabe. Peter McCabe. - Oh! I've brought my marriage lines, to show who I am. And my son's birth certificate. You won't need those, ma'am. Well, you will let me see him? It's out of our hands. The magistrate put him on remand first thing this morning. - What does that mean? - He's at Walton Jail now. Already? He won't come up for trial till the next assizes - plenty of time, yet. No, there isn't. I must see him. I've got to see him. I can't help you about that, ma'am. You've to go to Walton Jail and apply there. - But they will let me see him? - Yes. When? The sooner you get your application in, ma'am, the sooner you're likely to. Thank you [CAR AND CROWD NOISES] - Nora! - Ben! But I thought you were at sea. Miles away. You haven't lost your job, have you? Not on your life. Ship was diverted upriver to Manchester. We'll be there three days. The minute I was off duty I caught the first train. And there's so much I've got to tell yer. [CAR HORN] Keeping me waiting all this time! You're lucky I've turned up at all. I hope you're not getting any wrong ideas about me! Oh, of course not. But I've been reading the papers. "Captain McCabe" seems to have made a dramatic reappearance all of a sudden. Where are we going? Maybe we'll just drive round for a bit. OK. Petrol's cheap enough, I suppose. I've got a certain position to keep up, you know? It might do me a lot of harm if I was seen about with you. Perhaps you'd like me to wear a thick veil? Ah, that's the girl - always a snappy comeback. I tell you what... ...there's one place we can always go to. Where we went last night? You think you can do just what you like with me?! Now, have I ever done anything you didn't want me to? All I'm saying is... ...till it blows over, we've got to be very discreet. Very discreet. All right, Morris Bruno. Drive on. I knew you'd come round. The whole way up the river the crew talked about your father. And all I did was to keep my mouth shut. I wanted to tell every man-jack of them... ...that I was going to marry his daughter and I was proud of it. But the words simply wouldn't come. I just couldn't help it. My job was not yet secure. And... I was afraid. It was cowardly, that's what it was, but... ...if I'd lost this job, I'd lost my chance of marrying you. Yes. I see your point. Would be very convenient for you to change your name... ...just now. Well, that's not quite what I mean. Oh, it isn't? You haven't, by any chance, been seeing yourself as "Mrs Morris Bruno"? Well, why not? After all, every girl wants to get married - sooner or later. Don't come that stuff on me. You're not a homegirl! I wasn't born yesterday, you know? I never so much as dropped a hint about marrying you. Now, did I? Come on - have another drink. What do you take me for? Never mind. One thing you can be sure of... ...the girl I marry's got to be nice... - Like you?! That's the way to talk - now you are grown up! - Come on, the fun's only just started. - Leave me alone! Take your rotten hands off me! [SLAP] Get out of here! Get out, I tell yer! And you can go back to your slummy home on yer own two feet. I hated it not being with you when you needed me most. I want us to get married - right away. I'll get a Special Licence. We've waited so long, and this is our chance, now that I'm working. Oh, darling, with all this hanging over us - how can I? We must. We simply must. If you want to know, I'm... I'm scared. Suppose something else crops up to put it off again? And from now on I shall be away on long voyages. I shan't be able to be with you when things get even tougher. It's knowing I've got you, Ben. But that's not enough! As soon as you're my wife... ...everyone will know that I'm sticking by you. For better or for worse. Visitors for McCabe. [SOUND OF KEYS IN LOCK] This is where those awaiting trial are detained. You'll find your husband quite comfortable. He'll be wearing his ordinary clothes, too. That's something. This way. There you are, madam. They'll give you a knock when your time's up. You wait 'ere, George Alexander. I'll call you in a bit. - He's very quiet. - They most are, afterwards. It's a funny thing. I've had all sorts in my care. Frauds, thieves and poisoners. It's never the ones that get copped for murder with violence that cause trouble. Not by a long way. They lose their heads - that's what it is. And ever afterwards they get brooding over it. Over and over again. Makes you feel sorry for them. I, uh... I suppose he'll get the rope? Perhaps, perhaps not. Strictly speaking, according to the law... ...there's no argument to say... ...that he was mad drunk and didn't know what he was doing. I expect he'll be a lifer. This seems an awful cold sort of place, Peter. Here. You'd better sit down. Have you got some good, warm underwear? 'Course I have. I could do your washing for you? Ah, they're cracked about washing, 'ere. They took away one lot and brought me another before they was even dirty. I'm not doing any work 'ere. What do I want with clean clothes every week? Ah, but they won't see that. I'll bring you some pies next time I come. You used to love my pies. The best I ever tasted. [SOBS AND CRIES] Eh, eh, now. Steady, old girl. It's this waiting and waiting and nothing to do that I can't stand. It's putting me off my sleep. Imagine! Me not being able to sleep! Suffering from nerves like a... like a white-faced clerk. Peter, how could you? How could you do a thing like that? I don't know. I don't properly remember what happened. I saw him lying there and... ...I knew he'd said something that'd made me wild. But I... I didn't mean... Ah, what's the use? I've done it, that's what they say, and... and now I've got to pay for it. But you know the... there's just one thing I'd like to find out. Somebody said... but I expect they were having me on... What did they say? It was... somethin' about... about you an me havin'... ...havin' another child. - A boy. - So we have. We have? Born after you went away. Then why didn't you tell me? I didn't know where to write to. You can't blame me for that? - But before I went away? - I didn't know then. I wasn't sure. He's a clever boy. He won a scholarship. - No! - He did. If... If I could just see him once? I'd be satisfied. You can, if you like? I brought him along with me. He's in the corridor now. Come on in, George Alexander. Hello... Dad. It seems funny us... not knowing each other and... ...yet bein'... father and son. But that's my fault. I've nothing... to be proud of, but... ...cor, I... I'm proud of you. Peter McCabe, with a boy going to college. Here. Sit down, son. Come on, sit down. I got all night and day to rest there. Show your father your college cap, George Alexander. Put it on. Cor. That's smart, that is. And a gold badge, too. 'Ere. There's a motto 'ere. What does it say? "Experientia docet". French, eh? I expect you know what it means? It's Latin. It means "experience teaches". Does it, now? "Experience teaches". Well, that's true enough. Look 'ere, lad. Would you do me a little favour? Would you talk a bit of Latin to me? Oh, I know I'm ignorant and, I shan't understand a word, but... ...I can say to myself... I've seen my son, and I've heard him talk in Latin. And then... somehow... I shouldn't feel such a no-good, after all. Would... would you do that for me? You can't talk Latin much. It's not like French. I could recite some poetry, if you like? - Latin poetry? - Yes. Now look here... you put on your cap and... ...and stand over there. So as me an' your mother can see yer. [RECITES IN LATIN] I think the man wants us to go. Go first, love. Will yer shake hands with me, son? It was nice of yer to come an' see me 'ere Oh! Ere, you 'ave that. That used to belong to my Dad. And when you grow up... ...you can keep your baccy in it. Thanks, Dad. - In the meantime, what do you collect? - Foreign stamps. He's got all sorts, Peter. You wouldn't believe. He can keep his swaps in it. And now you'd better be going, son. And try and forget that you... ...you ever had an old man. God bless yer. I'll come in a minute. Peter? Nora got married yesterday. Good luck to 'er. [SHIP'S HORN] - It's got to be a quick goodbye. - I know. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [SHIP'S HORN AND SEAGULLS] [END THEME]
