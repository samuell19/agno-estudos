MAL: Auradon. (SIGHS) It's beautiful, isn't it? I'm Mal, daughter of Maleficent. And this is my home. It wasn't always. I was born on the Isle of the Lost, where all of the villains had been banished, locked away for good. That is until Prince Ben decided that their children should have a chance. And so, four villain kids, the V.K.'s, came to Auradon, including me. Long story short, Ben is the king now, I'm his girlfriend, and we are about to head back to the Isle to pick what will hopefully be a long line of new V.K.'s who get to come to Auradon and find their happily ever afters, too. FEMALE VOICE: Hey, check it out! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh, look at this. - It's V.K. day. - What?

(CHEERING) I can't believe this day has finally arrived. (CHEERING) I honestly wish we could take you all with us and some day, very soon, maybe we can. Yeah, we're gonna be back here so many times. You're going to be so sick of us. - So sick of us. - (ALL LAUGHING) Can I get a drum roll, please?

Come on, Squeaky. (CHEERING) And no way, we're splitting up the twins, so get over here, Squirmy, come on. (CHEERING) - FEMALE VOICE: Congratulations! - Bring it in, buddy! And last, but certainly not least, we all picked this girl because we all agreed that she could use a little bit of Fairy Godmother's goodness class. Give it on up for Dr. Facilier's daughter, - Celia. - I'm back. (CHEERING) We'll be back for you guys, next week, okay? And so, pack your stuff, your own stuff. - Where are we going? - We're going to... ALL: Auradon! (MAL SCREAMS, LAUGHS) Not a tentacle in sight. I think if Uma was up to something, we'd know by now. No, Ben, I know how villains think. And I don't trust Uma, as far as I can throw her. She's gonna wait until our defenses are down and then, that's when she's gonna strike. I really wish I had time to go do the dragon flyover because I can go so much higher. Well, you can't be everywhere at once. Besides, I've got your back. Now, come on, everyone's waiting for us. Wait. But you're getting more guards? I'm getting more guards, now breathe. (BOTH EXHALE) - Now, come on. - MAL: Okay. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - No, no, I'm doing this. - And you know what that means. FEMALE VOICE: Hey, girl. - (ALL CHEERING) - (GASPS) Here they come. (BAND PLAYING) MAL: Hey, how are you? - Stay. - Stay here? FAIRY GODMOTHER: Yes. Bippity-boppity, one, two, one, two. Can everybody hear me? Yes. FAIRY GODMOTHER: Ben. Thank you, Fairy Godmother. What's up, Auradon? (ALL CHEERING) Thank you. Thank you so much for coming out to welcome our new arrivals. - They'll be here soon. - Not like we had a choice. It worked out pretty well for the first four. Yeah, especially for you. Really funny. Mal, this is the exact spot we first met not so long ago. I feel like I've known you my whole life. But did I mention, I'm in love with you? ALL: Aw. (SONG BEGINS) I met this girl That rocked my world Like it's never been rocked And now I'm living just For her and I won't ever stop I never thought that It could happen to a guy like me But now look At what you've done You got me down on my knee (SONG ENDS) Mal, it's you and me. It's you and me forever. (GASPS) Will you marry me? Will you be my Queen? - (GASPS) - No! - Yes. - Yes, yeah! (ALL CHEERING) Oh, my... - I am so sorry. - It's okay. I'm so sorry. Yeah! Makes our movie nights seem a little tame. I love y... Movies. Me too. Yeah. A lifetime of plans, gone. Our family status, gone. Audrey, you were supposed to be his Queen, and you let him slip through your fingers. Your mother could hold onto a prince in her sleep. Don't you think I feel bad enough already, Grammy? FEMALE VOICE: Ben and Mal are the best. I'm so excited for Mal to be our Queen. You'd really rather have a V.K. on the throne than me? What is wrong with you, people? What is wrong with everybody? I'm engaged, man. - What, did you know? - Everything. You are going to rock that crown. Okay. So I've only done about 1,000 sketches of your wedding dress, and Belle's already planned an engagement party next week. Well, it's a really good thing I said yes. - Hugs. Hi. - Hugs. Hi. - I finally get a daughter. - BEAST: Congrats, Son. - BEN: Thanks, Dad. - I love you, Belle. - Aw, I love you. - FAIRY GODMOTHER: Oh, sweetie. I'm so happy for you both. Thank you so much, Fairy Godmother. - I think she liked it. - Bippity-boppity, you betcha. - All bow to Her Royal Majesty. - Oh, yes, her Royal Purple-ness. Silence, you annoying peasants. - As you wish, my liege. - Your Crankiness. - (MAL GRUNTS) - Congratulations. - (MAL GASPS) - You won him fair and square. Oh, wait, no, you didn't. You spelled Ben to destroy all of Auradon. Touching story for the grandkids. Okay. Let's do this. Speaking of kids, we have some kids waiting on us. So... if you'll excuse me. (ALL CHEERING) Congratulations, m'lady Mal. - MAL: Thank you. - MALE VOICE: Your Majesty. (ALL CHEERING) FEMALE VOICE: I have so much to show you. - All right, boys. - Let's hit the road. You're gonna see him soon, okay? Come on. - Do you have everything? - Yes, I have everything. - Are you sure? - I'm sure, Granny. - Oh, really? - (GASPS) My glue gun. I don't know what you're going to do without me. I'll miss you. Go on, go on. Goodbye, Granny. MAL: Here, let me help get this off of you. - Oh. - Okay. Let's go and do this. (CHUCKLES) (ALL CHEERING) So, as soon as we get to Auradon, you have to try ice cream. - And go swimming? - I can take you - to the Enchanted Lake. - (SQUEALS) I can't believe I get to live with you in your very own castle. It's just a little starter castle. Great grip. You play sports? Here. Go on. Trust me on this. I know. Dig in, dig in. You're going to be a wise and brave King. - He already is. - See? The cards never lie. The only reason they should be opening that barrier is for putting Uma back in, not letting more villains out. (ALL CHEERING) (ALL SCREAMING) (HADES GRUNTS) It's Hades. Stop the car. He's trying to escape. I am a god. I don't belong here. (HADES LAUGHING) (SCREECHES) Do not panic, okay? Nobody needs... - It's Ben. - ...to panic There's your precious Queen. She can't even protect us. Okay. We're panicking. Bippity-boppity run. (ALL SCREAMING) Come on, Mal, blast him. (ROARS) (MAL SCREECHING) EVIE: Are you okay? (MAL GROWLS) - Are you okay? - No. He was draining all of my magic with the ember, and I felt all of my powers slipping away. You're safe. He's back where he belongs. Yeah, for now. - We should go. - Okay. (SOBS) GRAMMY: A lifetime of plans, gone. Your mother could hold onto a prince in her sleep. (SOBS) I'm so tired of pretending. Where's my happy ending? (SONG BEGINS) I followed all the rules I drew inside the lines I never asked for anything That wasn't mine I waited patiently for my time But when it finally came He called her name And now I feel This overwhelming pain I mean, it's in my veins I mean, it's in my brain My thoughts are running In a circle like a toy train I'm kind of like a perfect picture With a broken frame I know exactly who to blame I never thought Of myself as mean I always thought That I'd be the Queen And there's no in between Because if I can't have that Then I would be the leader Of the dark and the bad Now there's a devil On my shoulder Where the angels used to be And he's calling me the Queen Being nice was my past time But I've been hurt For the last time And I won't ever let Another person Take advantage of me The anger bums my skin Third degree Now my blood's boiling hotter Than a fiery sea There's nobody Getting close to me They're gonna bow To the Evil Queen Your nightmare is my dream Just wait until they fall To my wicked schemes I never thought of myself As mean I always thought That I'd be the Queen And that's no in between Because if I can't have that Then I would be the leader Of the dark and the bad Now there's a devil On my shoulder Where the angels used to be And he's calling me The Queen of Mean - Calling me, calling me - The Queen of Mean Calling me, calling me - Calling me, calling me - The Queen of Mean FEMALE VOICE: Audrey! Something's pulling me It's so magnetic My body is moving Unsure where I'm headed All of my senses Have left me defenseless This darkness around me Is promising vengeance The price that I'm willing To pay is expensive There's nothing to lose When you're lonely and friendless So my only interest Is showing this princess That I am the Queen And my reign will be endless I want what I deserve I wanna rule the world Sit back and watch them learn It's finally my turn If they want a villain For a Queen I'm gonna be one that They've never seen I'll show them what it means Now that I am that I will be the ruler Of the dark and the bad Because the devil's On my shoulder Where the angels used to be And he's calling me The Queen of Mean Calling me, calling me - Calling me, calling me - The Queen of Mean Calling me, calling me I want what I deserve (SONG ENDS) BEAST: I think we all know why we're here. The people are in a panic about Hades. He almost got out. Who knows what he would've done if he had escaped? We can't risk having another villain on the loose. I really feel like this is my fault. I'm supposed to protect Auradon. You did, you do protect Auradon. Every time we open the barrier, we're exposed to danger. Maleficent, Uma, Hades. (CELLPHONE RINGING) Maleficent's scepter and the queen's crown - have been stolen. - (FAIRY GODMOTHER GASPS) - Uma? - We don't know that, Dad. When the people hear this, they will never wanna leave their houses. What do we tell them? Mal? What do we do? How do we keep evil out of Auradon? I think that there's only... one way to guarantee their safety. And I think that there... can't be anymore going in and out. I think that we have to close the barrier... forever. - No. - Son. - No. - Ben. - BEN: No, no, no, no. - MAL: Ben. Hey. I do not want to take away your dream. Because it was so beautiful. And it is why I fell in love with you. But as King, and as Queen... what's our duty? To protect Auradon. But do you know what would this mean? All those kids? - Are you prepared for that? - I know what it means... and no, I'm not prepared for it. I just think that we have no other choice. Son? Mal's right. I just don't think that we would forgive ourselves if something terrible happened. EVIE: Who else knows about the crown and the scepter? No one. (CHUCKLES) I mean, think about it, people are scared enough as it is. We have to employ these entirely new security measures. Will this delay our bringing over more V.K.'s? We're talking about closing the barrier for good. But you said no. I mean, the four of us are living the dream here, and we finally get to share that. I mean, what could be more important than that? Yeah. I know. I mean, maybe security or maybe peace of mind - for everyone in Auradon. - Is that what they're thinking? And were they seriously thinking that no one will ever go in or out of the Isle ever again? What, we never get to go back and see our parents? And what about these kids? We promised them that they could go back and visit whenever they wanted. Yeah, I know. M., I am so glad that you are going to be Queen. You will be a part of these conversations, you will stand up for the V.K.s. Thank you for telling me. You're gonna be a great Queen. - Morning. Got the beach towels. - Sorry. Morning. - These. - Hey. I really think she's gonna like the cake, you guys. - Oh, yeah? - CARLOS: Oh, no. Okay. Who got into Jane's cake? Delicious. I especially love the lack of dirt. And the lack of flies. - Want some? - Thank you. (BOTH SIGH) I was hoping you were home. (CHUCKLES) Is this a joke? What are you doing with the crown and the scepter? Well, I wanted them, so I took them. And you, of all people should understand that, Mal. Wait, Audrey, stop! Don't use that. I thought you liked spells. - Okay, Audrey, you're better... - Quiet! - It's not a toy. It's dangerous. - I want to be dangerous. My life was perfect until you stole it. And then Auradon turned its back on me. Well, it's time for a little payback. Audrey, wait! (LAUGHS) You think Ben will love you now, you old hag? You'll pay the price of what you did and so will all of Auradon. So long, suckers! Whoa! You might wanna think of a spell for that. There's no spell that can reverse the curse of the scepter. - Well, that's a shame. - MAL: Forget about me. Audrey's out for revenge. And all of Auradon is in danger. What should we do? The only thing more powerful than the scepter... - is Hades' ember. - JAY: Oh! Like he's just gonna hand it over, give them back - to the Isle. - And no one knows - where his lair is. - CELIA: I do. I'm his errand rat. I've got the key at my dad's. You are coming. But I just got here. DIZZY: Mal? (SCREAMS) Dizzy, stay here to take care of the twins. We'll be right back and everything will be just fine. Go inside. Guys, go get your stuff. DIZZY: Come on, boys, let's go. How bad is it? You age beautifully. Now, let's just get you into something fabulous. - Okay. - EVIE: Come on. Okay. - Oh, yeah, there we go. - Okay. Almost there. Noble steed, proud and fair, you shall take us anywhere. Carlos, you're gonna miss Jane's birthday. CHAD: (LAUGHS) Oh. Looks like Carlos forgot about your birthday, huh? Well, maybe not, maybe he just took the wrong trail or something. Or you know what? They probably don't celebrate birthdays on the Isle, maybe it's like a cultural thing. Oh, yeah. Or maybe he just forgot. You never know. (CHUCKLES) Hey, Chad, look! There's people taking selfies. Selfies! Guys, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait for me! Wait for me! FEMALE VOICE: Why is she here? Did anybody save me any guacamole? No? It's like someone forgot to invite me. Well, don't be expecting Mal, she's... not feeling herself. Does that make you sad? Does it just ruin everything? Mindless little drones. How could you forget what she did to us? How could you forget that I was supposed to be your Queen? Time out, okay, okay. Time out. First off, great new look. I absolutely love feathers. But, hey, before you do whatever you're gonna do, I was wondering if maybe you wanted a... loyal boyfriend by your side? Partner in crime? Sidekick? Or maybe just a lackey to do your bidding, um, change tires. Or smoothie runs? - Please? - You can be useful. - Yeah? - Fine. Stand behind me. CHAD: Okay. Auradon likes to forget so much. They'll love this. (SONG BEGINS) Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to Jane Happy birthday To you (SONG ENDS) The Enchanted Lake. Audrey. Sweet dreams. (GASPS) (AUDREY LAUGHING) (CELLPHONE RINGING) Hey, Jane. I'm on my way to the party. - My meetings ran long. - No, no. Stay where you are, Ben. Audrey's got the scepter and everyone's asleep. I'm gonna call Mom and tell her to get her wand. Is Mal with you? Jane? Jane? (THUNDER RUMBLING) (TIRES SCREECH) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Hey. I'm me again. Duh. Evil magic doesn't work here. Kind of the point. - Welcome back. - MAL: Thank you. (LAUGHS) (STOMPING) - DR. FACILIER: Hey. - Daddy. DR. FACILIER: Here she is. (LAUGHS) Come on. And.. And... Ho! Hey, yeah. Come here little rascal. Ah! So, what kind of hustle you got going on with them - shiny people? - No hustle. I got friends on the other side. Ah! I hear you. I hear you. We're on a mission. I'm kind of a major player so that's why I can't stay long. You make sure you get your cut. MALE VOICE: Alerts of the sleeping spell keep coming in as it spreads throughout Auradon. Uh. guys. Come look at this. MALE VOICE: There are rumors that Sleeping Beauty's daughter, Audrey, is behind the spell. We're trying to discover who is responsible for these vicious lies, and which villain has perpetrated this evil. We have an update. It's what? It's moving this way? It is moving this way. - Wow! Rookie mistake? - Long time nay see. - Get off my bike, Hook. - Catch me if you can, Jay. - Over the roofs. - Cut them off. - Yup. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, not you. They got this. You and me gotta go find the ember. Good timing. It's right about his nap time. (HOOK LAUGHING) Hey. How big is that dog? You'll see. Okay, stay quiet. It echoes, like, crazy in here. (DOG BARKING, GROWLING) Come on. Come, come. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (DOGS BARKING) (HADES SNORING) (DOGS BARKING) What are you doing here? I noticed you were low on canned corn. (GASPS) Hi, Dad. Quite a show you put on the other day. Right back at you. Hmm. I was just coming to see you. Really? Wonder why. Is it because I'm gonna be Queen? Ah! (LAUGHS) Now, Mal, don't be bitter. You abandoned me when I was a baby. No. No, I left your mother. She's not the easiest person to get along with. - You think? - Huh. You see? We have something in common already. - We both hate your mother. - No. I don't hate my mother. She may be an evil lunatic, but at least she stuck around. Oh! Boo-hoo. Wake up and smell the stink. You think you've had it rough? I used to be a god! I had an entire world which bore my name. And now I have nothing! And you have no idea what that feels like. Really? Because for 16 years, I had nothing. And now, I have a whole world. But unless I get that ember, it's game over. Hold, please. (SONG BEGINS) Listen little girl You're talking to a god And I don't wanna hear The drama - Kindness ain't my brand - Oh, I guess that's why you ran Try being married to your mama - You stink at being a dad - Poor, Mali, are you sad? Not as sad as you Without your powers I didn't come to fight For once do something right I steal souls Were you expecting flowers? I only need you 'Cause I came here - for something - I've given you everything - By giving you nothing - By giving me nothing - I did what I had to do - Ooh No, you only did What's best for you Well you can learn A thing or two When push comes to shove You do What you've gotta do, yeah You were never there I guess you don't have a phone You never called to say "I miss you" Are you kidding? Is this a joke? You need to let it go - You're stronger with those daddy issues - Oh, thank you Show me some respect It ain't easy to neglect My attention Would've made you softer Should I be proud? Don't turn this thing around I guess you are Your father's daughter Don't think I need you I just came here for something I've given you everything - By giving you nothing - By giving me nothing - And I did what I had to do - Ooh I made it on my own No thanks to you Well you could learn A thing or two When push comes to shove You do what you gotta do How about I go with you And we'll spend some time? How about you stay here 'Cause you're out of your mind Let's make new memories You can show me the town No you can keep Your memories now - Get over it - I am over it BOTH: I'm over you being over it Let's dance BOTH: I did What I had to do No you only did What's best for you Well you can learn A thing or two When push comes to shove You do When push comes to shove You do When push comes to shove You do What you gotta do Yeah Please... (SONG ENDS) Do you wanna make up for being a lousy dad? - Give me the ember. - The ember only works for me. No. It'll work for me. We're blood. (CHUCKLES) You're only half Hades. The ember won't do everything for you that it does for me. I'll take my chances. If it gets wet, it's game over. (CHUCKLES) That's my girl. I guess that's the reason why he's always asking about you. Evie is the only one who knows that he's my dad. And as far as I'm concerned, he doesn't even exist. No. No, I want the Auradon guard handing out gas masks. Well, not everyone's asleep. Find out if anyone has seen Audrey. And find out if she has a list of demands. - Just one. - (GASPS) I demand my life back. I have a proposition. I'll wake everybody up right now... under one... itty-bitty condition, Benny-boo. Make me your Queen, and we'll rule side by side. Did someone put a spell on you? - Just tell me who and... - You'll what? Marry them? (LAUGHS) Most people get dumped because they aren't good enough. I wasn't bad enough. How do you like me now, Benny-boo? (LAUGHS) I like the old Audrey better. She wouldn't wanna hurt Auradon. Just give me the scepter, and I'll forgive you. You'll forgive me? I don't think so. Sleeping is too good for you. Sleeping is too good for Auradon. (AUDREY LAUGHING) All right. Get in, get out. - Jay, you're good? - Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Whoa. You got a little Hades thing going. - Wow. - That thing packs a punch, huh? (ALL GASP) - We made it, bro. - We made it. Hey, guys. We're just coming for a wee visit. MAL: Come on. Hey. Hey. (GASPS) - (SIGHS) - No! (UMA CACKLES) Drop something? It can't get wet. Give it back before it goes out. - Uma? - Uma? That's my name. No! UMA: Hi, boys. (LAUGHS) Welcome back. Uma, you swam off and forgot all about us. Yeah. Planning her revenge, no doubt. It's not all about you, Mal. I was looking for a hole in the barrier to let everybody out. And you know what I found, boys? It's way better out there than we thought. There's this thing that looks like a furry rock called a coconut. And fish so big you could dance on their backs. And they've been keeping it all for themselves. Whatever. Uma, I need that to break a spell. Cast by Audrey, Sleeping Beauty's daughter. Mm. So the good guy is the bad guy? Well, I might not give it back. Let's see what happens. Uma, it's not the time for games! People's lives are in danger! Guarantee me that every single villain kid who wants to, - can get off the isle. - I can't do that. Can't do that? - Well, how about now? - Deal. Deal. - (GASPS) - Uma! - (GASPS) - (UMA LAUGHS) Her word is good. I'll still keep this, for the time being. Because if you think I trust you to save the world on your own, think again. - This is a job for pirates. - Yeah. We can always go back to hating each other when this is over. Fine. - Where are our bikes? - Oh, yeah. We crashed them. (IMITATES ENGINE, WHISTLES) (IMITATES CRASH) - (LAUGHS) - Here's a thought. We could try to be friends. Put our history behind us and celebrate our differences. Yeah? Who wants gum? - Let's go. - No? Ah... No. I'm in charge. Let's go. (ALL SNORING) MAL: They're asleep. Everyone. I can't get Ben. - Or Dizzy or Doug. - Or Jane. The signal's out. Is that Auradon Prep? Yeah. When everybody wakes up, you're going to love it. Geez. - Everything is so... - Freaky. ...green. You have leaves on your trees. And what are those colored things on the bushes? - Uh... Flowers? - Flowers are pretty. Cantaloupe! Mm! Mm! We don't have fresh fruit on the Isle, remember? - Thank you. - They're grapes. Grapes? I love grapes. I believe I deserve some compensation for my muscles, my wile, and my role in this endeavor. You do. Me not squashing you like a bug. Think I'm scared of you, Jay? BOTH: Guys. - DUDE: Mm! - Dude. Delicious. (BURPS) - Dude, really? - What? It wasn't me, I swear. Okay. It was me. Hey, do you know what happened here? Yup. Audrey showed up. She put everybody to sleep. - And then she turned some of them to... - Guys. Hannah turned to stone. All right. Everybody stay on their toes. Look, since we're here, let's check the school. No. Audrey went straight for the crown, so, I think it's safe to assume that she's gonna go for Ben and his castle next. - That's where we'll go. - Says who? - Says me. - UMA: Says you. And that's supposed to mean something to me? Guys. To the castle. - How did Mal break my spell? - I don't know. - And what is Uma doing here? - Hey, no, no, no, no, no. AUDREY: Come clean, Chad. - Where did they go? - I don't know. I don't know, okay? I can go check for you. - How about that? - Stay! (CHAD WHIMPERS) It's about to get a little ugly. (LAUGHS) MAL: Ben! - DUDE: (LAUGHS) This way. - (MAL SIGHS) - Ben could be asleep anywhere. - Or turned to stone. Okay. Ben! I got a scent. Very pungent cologne. Easy to track. Follow me, people. - That's great, Dude. - FYI, I give great cuddles, too. Really? I never had a pet growing up. Well, except for the elk head in Dad's man cave - but that wasn't... - Hold up. What's this? Uh... Any chance this was already there? (SIGHS) And follow me. MAL: Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Stay here, okay? (HOOK WHISTLES) I can feel you looking. Good. So you can track, cuddle, and talk. Hey, do you think his puppies would be able to talk, too? All right, man. He's taken. You want a dog, adopt a rescue. (LAUGHING) Talking puppies. That's crazy. - Come here. - DUDE: He seems nice. (SIGHS) I bet you lost some sleep thinking about me on the loose? No. Dragons don't really lose sleep. I wonder what fried octopus tastes like. Okay. Why do we not do this? We're celebrating our differences. (LAUGHS) I believe we're being challenged. Let's split up and look for Audrey. That makes absolutely no sense. Unless you give me my ember, she's going to spell you. Girls! We have a situation here. AUDREY: Do you like a prince, Mal? How about a knight in shining armor? Or knights? (LAUGHS) (SONG BEGINS) Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back We can counter their attack Hit them till the armor cracks This could get a little sticky How to win this battle Could be tricky But I know the best way Fall back let me lead You hold the line and we'll Bring them to their knees Swords in the air If you're with me - Yeah - They got us outnumbered one-to-fifty The victory is ours Because I've got a strategy You take the left and the rest Of you can follow me - This is my crew - Look this is my squad - This is my turf - Oh, my gosh Look guys we got bigger fish To fry Put your differences aside 'Cause now we're on the same side Till the night falls Everyone We'll stay together Till the battle is done Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back We can counter their attack Hit them till the armor cracks Until the night falls We're aligned It doesn't mean That we're on the same side Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back Hit them hard And hit them fast They're too heavy to react The situation is getting Kind of heavy Hold your weapons tight Keep them steady 'Cause if we stick together We can make it out alive I will cause a distraction You attack them from the side All my soldiers stand at the ready We can cut them up Like confetti We'll hit them from the front You counter from behind Don't forget the fate Of Auradon's on the line This is all-out war They got us outnumbered The way the swords clash Is the sound of the thunder And we are not going under We will never run for cover We battle for the victory And ride for each other Until the night falls Everyone We'll stay together Till the battle is done Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back We can counter their attack Hit them till the armor cracks Until the night falls We're aligned It doesn't mean That we're on the same side Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back Watch your back Hit them hard And hit them fast They're too heavy to react Suit of armor strong and true, make this metal bust a move. No! (CHEERS) Until the night falls You can trust I'm gonna help you Win this battle because I got your back Got your back Got your back Got your back All for one and that's a fact Knights fall pitch black (SONG ENDS) No! ALL: Yeah! - JAY: Come on. - Yeah! We did that. That's what I'm talk... - (JAY GRUNTS) - Hey, good job. - No. - CARLOS: We're... (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Guys, come on. This was so great. We were a team. We worked together. Come on. Come on. Mm-mm. (EVIE SIGHS) You know what we should try? An icebreaker. You say something you really like about the other person, okay? I'll start. Harry. Great accent. - Now, you go. - Is she always this perky? Oh, it wasn't really your turn, but thank you. - Okay. Evie, come here. - Yeah. - I love you. - I love you. I love this energy, but we are very short on time. Audrey clearly knows that we're here and we need to get out of here, - ASAP. - All right, where does this cheerleader bunk down? Even if she's not there, we might find some sort of clue. Actually, she's still in the dorms. You're right. Because of summer school. (LAUGHS) What? Summer school? Summer school! No wonder she wants revenge. Okay. I need you guys to go find Ben. We will meet back at Evie's in two hours, okay? Sounds like we're going with my plan. I'm just saying. It was kind of the obvious plan. - Uma said it first. - Right. So my plan. - Right? - Whatever. She's nowhere on campus. Found her diary. And dang, did you ruin Audrey's life. Okay. So did you find anything in there that we don't already know or... She hangs out at Fairy Cottage. You know, where Flora, Fauna and Merryweather hid her mom from your mom. Yes. The irony is not lost on me. How could anyone with this bed ever be unhappy? Okay. How do I look? Okay. The bling stays here. - But she's bad. - And we're not. Ben! Ben! Dude. Come on. Nothing? These things just grow everywhere. Hey, we should play that icebreaker. Um, Jay, I like the way that you can bounce around and jump off things. These are free, right? JAY: Yeah. Um... (CHUCKLES) I like how you get a kick out of a berry bush. I guess you've probably seen everything by now, huh? Furry rocks. Giant fish. You're probably used to grabbing lunch off of a bush. No. I mean, no, not really. I mainly just use the vending machines at practice. You know, tourney, kind of eats up most of my time. So... (LAUGHS) Tourney, that's a wee boy's game. Hey, you know what would be fun? To go rafting on a jungle river. - Find a lost civilization. - Oh, or maybe a penguin. Oh, well, you'd find those more in like icebergs, but I'd love to see one of those. You guys are killing me. Hmm. - P.S., your mutt went that way. - DUDE: Carlos! - Dude, what do you see? - DUDE: This way! I really hope they found Ben. - (SIGHS) - Nice digs. I got a really good deal. (GROANING) CELIA: It's okay. Shh! It's okay. Don't worry, Dizzy. We can fix this. And once we do, they're gonna let all the kids come from the Isle. So, happy dreams. (DOUG SNORING) - UMA: Uh, who's the dude? - Doug. Doug. Wake up. - Wake up. - He's spelled. Is she not a fast learner? She's emotionally involved, okay? Well, in that case, she should be able to wake him up. True love's kiss. Works every time. Well, we haven't used the "L" word yet. Can we be alone? (SONG BEGINS) Don't freak out it's okay 'Cause true love can save the day And I think we feel the same But I don't know When we met it was sweet He was oh so into me Seems like things are meant To be but I don't know Does he love me? Or does he love me not? Do I love him? And is it strong enough? - One kiss - One kiss It all comes down to this One kiss One kiss One kiss, one kiss This moment could be it And I wanna know so here I go Keep it cool keep it calm Think he's loved me all along But maybe I got it wrong So I don't know He's so good got my back But maybe I'm just too bad Could we be a perfect match? No I don't know Does he love me? Or does he love me not? Do I love him? And is it strong enough? - One kiss - One kiss It all comes down to this One kiss, one kiss - One kiss - One kiss This moment could be it And I wanna know so here I go Yeah here I go I feel my heartbeat beating Saying it's gonna work But if I'm dream, dream Dreaming this is gonna hurt Either I will or I won't What if I do and you don't? Is he my Romeo? Oh, there's only one, one way To really know Hey Hey Hey One kiss, one kiss It all comes down to this One kiss, one kiss One kiss, one kiss This moment could be it I, I, I wanna know So here I go (YAWNS) - Here I go - (YAWNS) Here I go Here I go (SONG ENDS) (SNORES) (LAUGHS) Ben! Boy, something stinks. And it wasn't me this time. (GROWLS) - (GROWLS) - (SCREAMS) Gil. - CARLOS: Gil. - JAY: Watch out! (GROWLS) You need some serious nose adjustments. I'm not so sure. (GROWLS) Ben? Did Audrey do that? Huh! I thought I recognized those pants. Oh, he's got a boo-boo. That's why he's so cranky. You know, my dad said that his dad did not handle pain well at all. (GROWLS) You're good with animals. Do something. But... Okay. All right. - (GROWLS) - Hey, Ben. It's me, Carlos, all right? - (GROWLS) - Ben! Ben! It's Carlos, all right? You know me. You helped me once. Remember, with Dude? Right? Let me help you. Come on. Let me see your hand. All right. Attaboy. Beast... King... So... Whatever. Oh, yeah. That's a big one. Uh... I'm gonna count, all right? One... - Two. - Two... - (GRUNTS) - (ROARS) - There it is. You did it. - (GROWLS) (GROWLS) Hey. - Oh, my gosh, I was so worried. - You didn't show up. - I didn't forget your party. - I got scared she got you too. BOTH: I'm so glad you're all right. All right. - You good? - Yeah. Take a seat right there, okay? There you go. (JAY AND BEN LAUGH) - Oh, that was funky. - It was. There's... - Huh? Oh, wow. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You need another blast. Please... - Please stop. - Huh. It's Enchanted Lake water. I guess it can only do so much. Well, well, well. Harry Hook. And you, my little duckling are... ravishing. Okay. Ravishing and taken... just in case anyone was confused. Hold on. Who's side are they on? They escaped and joined us. And Mal has the ember, which is our only hope to stop Audrey. Details to follow. Hades' ember? Has Mal gone back to the Isle? I said details to follow. We're meeting up - with Mal, Evie and Uma. Let's go. - Uma? - Details to follow. - All right. Hey, Jay... (CLEARS THROAT) ...yeah, thanks for saving me, gorgeous face. That was a really good idea, to check Audrey's room. Now, we know that we're on the right track. Is there an insult in there that I missed? Just... I wanted to thank you. No! You think you're on the right track? We're not going anywhere! Let's mess them up a little. I say we go back to my place and maybe binge-watch some TV? Huh? Or maybe order some stuff online? Yeah? Yeah. What about pizza, huh? Yeah, you don't like pizza. Salad? Sa...! (SCREAMS) No, no, no, no, no, Audrey. Audrey. - (SCREAMING) Audrey! - (LAUGHS) (BANGING ON DOOR) - CHAD: Audrey! - (BANGING CONTINUES) UMA: I don't know whose birthday it is, - but I want this cake. - (MAL CHUCKLES) So, I maybe kind of missed the boat a little bit on calling you Shrimpy and not letting you join the gang. Yeah. We really could've torn up the Isle together. Oh! - MAL: Celia! - We're trapped! Are you guys okay? What's going on? You've caused my friends pain and fear. We've had enough, now disappear! You guys, I'm sorry. My spells aren't working. Audrey's magic is getting stronger. BOTH: You've caused our friends pain and fear we've had enough, now disappear. No! You did it! Together! This is what I've been talking about. - I guess my shell likes you. - (LAUGHS) Why don't you hold on to that? (LAUGHS) Hey, it's your bae. (GASPS) MAL: Ben! (LAUGHS) - BEN: Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm so much - better right now. Are you okay? - Yeah. MALE VOICE: Are you okay? I always knew you'd be part of the solution. - What is this? - Oh, yeah. - I could get used to this. - You like it? I love this. - What about those? - BEN: Oh. - No. - I like them. Okay, so, we all think that Audrey could be at Fairy Cottage. We have no idea where it is. - Did she ever take you there? - Every Fairy Godmother's Day. Where is Fairy Godmother when you need her? I wish I knew. Hey, this might be a bad time. But... Happy birthday. I made it with my 3D printer. That's our names put together. - JANE: No. I get it, yeah. - Yeah, because, you know, we're together. You and me were like a couple. Right. 'Cause Jane and Carlos make Jarlos. Yes. Yeah. I could've gone with Cane, um, but I went with Jarlos. Unless you prefer Cane. - Oh, no. No, I love it. - You prefer Cane? Yes, you do. It's fine. You know what? I can remake it. It's cool. - It's fine. - No, Carlos. It's perfect. Doug! Go with Jane. We need to find Fairy Godmother. - They might need some muscle. - Hey. Well, I'll go. Yeah, actually, I would feel better. Yeah, actually, I'd feel better, too. Same. Actually, I would, too. All right, man. Let's do it. - Let's go, Jane. - Okay. - Be careful, okay? - JANE: I will. CARLOS: Come on, Dude. She's not upstairs. (BANGING ON DOOR) Chad? I want my mommy. No. BEN: It's okay. What happened, buddy? Hmm. Ben. Ben! (GASPS) Your face. She's gone? Huh? The door is open. I'm free. Freedom! Oh! Freedom! JANE: Oh, my gosh. Hi, Mom. Um, I don't know if you can hear me. But it's been a really crazy day. On the plus side, it's been the longest birthday I've ever had. On the minus side, everybody's under an evil spell. But on the plus side, Carlos remembered my birthday. See? We're going to figure out how to undo this. We'll find a way to make this right, Mom. UMA: Ooh. All right. Let's get this Audrey chick taken care of already. - (MAL LAUGHS) - What do you say, girls? Time to wrap things up? BEN: You know, someday, you're gonna have to tell me how you guys all got teamed up. Actually, Mal promised to let all the kids off the Isle - once this is over. - Mal? I have to tell you guys something. Um... (SIGHS) I lied to you. The kids won't be coming off the Isle. - What do you mean? - The program is shut down. And the barrier... will be closed for good. - (HOOK GRUNTS) - For Auradon's safety. Hold up. So we're saving your precious people and your behinds for a lie. I knew it was a mistake to trust you. You're always out for yourself. And you, King Benny... you're probably just gonna throw us all back inside. You know what? I actually thought you were brave. You're nothing but a chicken. Too scared to tell me I was never gonna see - my dad again. - Celia. Celia. Celia, no! - EVIE: Celia! - No! No. Regain your might and ignite! No... Regain your might and ignite! Bummer. Let's go find Gil and leave them all to rot. No. Uh... Uma! Evie... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I just... I thought that... I was afraid to tell you. I thought I was gonna lose my best friend. But I had to do something. I had to protect Auradon. Closing the barrier was your idea? I did it for us. I did it for our life that we have here now. For our life? What about the kids that we left behind on that island? The kids that we promised? We were their only hope. I thought you were gonna stand up for the V.K.'s. But instead, you lied to them. And you lied to Jay. And you lied to Carlos. And you lied to me. We're your family. Evie. Evie, come on. I had no choice! No. (SONG BEGINS) Here you are alone And you deserve it Your friends have turned To stone and that's on you You had a cause to serve But did you serve it? Did you see yourself in a way That wasn't true? Why tell all those lies? You feel unworthy Like there isn't solid ground For you to stand But a sacrifice is not A firm foundation You cannot build a castle On a mountain made of sand This is not your father's Fairy tale And no it's not Your mother's fault you fail So when your story comes To light Make sure the story That they write Goes once upon a time She fought the dragon Once upon a time That beast was me Once upon a misspent youth She faced herself She spoke the truth That's how I see My once upon a time This time MAL: Uma! Uma, stop! Please, stop! I need your help. We have a chance if we do this together. Your friends kick you to the curb? Good. Ben saw something in you. And today, Uma, I saw it, too. You care. Uma, you care about everybody. And Auradon is worth saving. Help us, please. You talk pretty, but... she's already made up her mind. UMA: You brought this on yourself, Mal. You figure out how to fix it. Let's go. Life is not a storybook But life unfolds in chapters Turn the page And start to make amends There's no pre-written Guarantee Of happily ever after Step into your greatness Before your story ends So when your story ends They'll say Once upon a time A girl flew higher Once upon a time She made things right Once upon a tie that binds She changed her heart To change their minds That's got to be My once upon a time This once upon a time Will finally see My once upon a time This time (SONG ENDS) CELIA: Help me, Mal! AUDREY: Yeah, save your little friend, Mal! (GROWLS) (AUDREY LAUGHS) CELIA: Help me, Mal! - (AUDREY LAUGHS) - (GROWLS) Careful not to fry your little V.K. buddy. BOTH: Whoa! She doesn't stand a chance without the ember. Help me, Mal! - (AUDREY GRUNTS) - (ROARS) Come on. (LAUGHS) Hold still, you little brat! (MAL SCREECHES) We're stronger together. We're stronger together! I'm right here, Mal! Regain your might and ignite. I'm right here, girl. I'm right here. Regain your might and ignite! (GROWLS) Yes! - You want a piece of this, huh? - No, no! (LAUGHS) Go, Mal! - Go, Mal! - You got this! You got this, girl! - Yeah! Come on! - Yes! (LAUGHS) Mal! Celia. It's okay. I've got you. Audrey? Oh, no. HADES: You're only half Hades. The ember won't do everything for you that it does for me. (ALL YAWNING) BOTH: I'm hungry. Same. Oh! - Mom. Mom! - Bibbidi-bobbidi, what happened? The spell has been broken. It's okay. (BEN COUGHS) Come on. Let's go. - EVIE: You good? - CARLOS: Yeah. She's slipping away. There's only one person in the world who might be able to do something about this, and that's Hades. Hades? He wouldn't do it. I wouldn't risk it. Actually, he might do it for me. He's my father. Okay. Well, I'll have to send guards to get him. Maybe I can hitch a ride. The Isle is my home. Someone needs to be there to protect it. Well, then, you will need your first mate. The Isle will be in very good hands. Can I go, too? I wish I could be in both places. I really think that Evie was right. And... I do think that we could've been friends. And I'm really sorry that I lied to all of you guys. You deserved so much better than that. You were just trying to do the right thing. Yeah. I get it. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Thank you for coming. Didn't have much choice. Can you wake her? Since when do heroes care about villains? - She's... - One of your own. (CHUCKLES) Right. When you guys try to destroy the world... it's an error in judgment. But when it's one of us... lock them up and throw away the key. Right, Beast? Yeah. I'm gonna need to use my hands. (SIGHS) Haven't lost my touch. (BOTH GROWL) Dad! (ALL GASP) (GASPS) Audrey. You're okay. Tell me it was all a bad dream. I wish I could. But, it's over now. (SCOFFS) I'm sorry. I wanted to hurt you both. I wanted to hurt all of you. I have owed you an apology for... a very long time now. And so have I. And perhaps, I have owed you one, too. Oh, yeah. (SCOFFS) Dad! I'm gonna have to miss you all over again. Thanks for a glimpse of the sun. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) FEMALE VOICE: Look at you! That color! There they are. (ALL CHEERING) Hi. Lady Mal and I wanna thank you for celebrating our engagement with us today. I couldn't be prouder or happier to call you my Queen. So... raise your glasses. To our future Queen of Auradon. - To our Queen of Auradon! - To our Queen of Auradon! - Speech, Your Special-ness. - Speech, Your Fancy One. (CROWD LAUGHS) I can't. (CROWD GASPS) - I can't be Queen of Auradon. - Mal. I can't turn my back on the Isle. We made a decision... to close the barrier forever. And it was my idea. But it's wrong. I've learned... that you can't live in fear... because it doesn't actually protect you from anything. (CHUCKLES) You never know where the bad is gonna come from. And you never know where the heroes are gonna come from either. Without Uma and her pirates, Auradon would be gone. And without Hades... my father... (CROWD GASPS) ...Audrey would be gone. We are all capable of good and bad, no matter which side of the barrier we come from. And that's why I can't be Queen of just Auradon. I have to be Queen of the Isle, too. And it's time that we take the barrier down forever. - We can't do that. - It's up to us, Dad. I choose to be a King who moves forward. It's time for forgiveness. It's time for new beginnings. - The barrier will come down! - Yes! (CHEERS) Bring it down, Mal. (ALL CHEERING) To make the world a better place... ALL: We have to do it face to face. (ALL CHEERING) FEMALE VOICE: Look! My plan. Yes!

What do you say you and me go exploring? I'll do a gap year. - Jungles or icebergs? - Both? Yeah. Chest bump! (GRUNTS) Hey. Get it, girl You know what? - Mal came through. - She always does. - So, she's definitely taken. - Definitely. So is Evie. What's my name? Uma. No. Oh! - Hi. - Hi. Whoa! Am I invited to the wedding? Hi, Dad. (MAL LAUGHS) I'm sure you two will be very happy together.

Yeah. (SIGHS) Do you think that they miss us? Yeah. Of course. 'Cause we're rotten... ALL: To the core. Hey, last one over the bridge... ALL: Is a rotten apple! (SONG BEGINS) It don't matter What you look like It don't matter What you wear - Hey! - How many rings You got on your finger We don't care! - No we don't care - You gotta dig a little deeper For you it's gonna be tough You gotta dig a little deeper You ain't dug near far enough Dig down deep inside yourself Find out What you need Blue skies And sunshine guaranteed Ooh whoa (SONG ENDS)
