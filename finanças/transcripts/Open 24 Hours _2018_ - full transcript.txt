No. You own your own car? Uh, not yet. But my friend can drive me here, and I can get the bus. Okay. Well, what we're looking for is someone to work the night shift. From ten to six in the morning. Just to let you know, we don't get a lot of business during the night. You will get some hunters and farmers rolling in around four or five. These hours work for you? Yeah, I can work whenever you want. I wish you had a little more experience. I'm a really fast learner. And a hard worker. So, you were convicted of a felony. Yeah. Did you go to prison? For a little while. For what? I set my boyfriend on fire. Did he deserve it? Yeah. When did you get out? Two weeks ago. My parole officer told me about this place. So you have a parole officer? Tom Doogan. He's the one told me about this job. I know Tom. I... I really need this job. Well, I had an interview this morning. And to be honest, I didn't like him too much. He reminded me of my daughter's husband, and he's an asshole. I go a lot on my gut feelings. You promise you won't give me any shit? Yeah, I promise. All right. You got the job. Thank you. I've just been, I've looking for a job since I got out. So, this is really great. You won't regret it. Can you start tonight? Yeah, absolutely. Do you have a number I can reach you at? No, I don't have a cell phone right now. Home phone? Get here around 9:30. Bobby will give you the walk-through and show you how to run the register. Okay. It's good meeting you, Mary. And good luck. Thanks. Tell Tom he owes me a six pack. So? I got it. Oh my God, Mary! Congratulations. It doesn't pay very very will. And I'll have to work the graveyard shift. But, I'll take what I can get, right? Absolutely. You need a job. It's a great first step. So, when do you start? Tonight. Wow, that was fast. Yeah. I'm going to take you to lunch today to celebrate. What are your plans? Uh, I need to meet my parole officer at 11. Let's meet at Canton Square at like, 12:30? Okay. I think this is the start of a new life. 12:30. I'll see you then. Stop! Oh my God.

Is it 11 o'clock already? Yeah. Who's in the bathroom? Nobody. Who were you talking to? I wasn't taking to anybody. I tried calling you. What's wrong with your phone? It's not plugged in. Why? Because I don't want a phone. Plug your phone in. This isn't a request. If I can't get hold of you things are going to get very difficult. Listen, I know all about you and your boyfriend. I'm sure you're going to carrying that around with you your whole life. But you have a chance now to do something with yourself. So don't fuck it up. I'm not crazy, you know. The file says paranoid and delusional, who suffers from hallucinations. You know, I didn't do anything. Then why are you here? You need to save the denial speeches for someone who cares. I got a job. Good for you. Where? Deer Gas Market. I see. You took my advice. Ed says you owe him a six pack. Yeah, I owe that old bastard more than a six pack. When do you start? Tonight. Well that's good. Thanks. I'll check in with you tonight. Just to fill you in on a little secret. There were a lot of people didn't want you released. They think you're still highly unstable. A lot of families and officials want you to fail. They'd like nothing better than for you to do something stupid. So they can use it against you, lock you up and throw away the key. Just like your boyfriend. And guess who's their only source of information? - You. - That's right. So walk the line, report back to me everyday, and I'll make sure you stay out of jail. Is that understood? I thought you didn't care. I don't. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. What were you looking at? Oh, nothing. I just thought I saw someone. Who? Nobody. Are you ready? Yeah. You want to go to Harmond's or the Mayflower? Mayflower is fine. ♪ Make up my mind ♪ So come on, tell me more about this job. What do you want to know? What did the owner say? He wished I had more experience. It's a gas station. It's not like it's rocket surgery. Yeah but, I've never worked in a gas station before. Well, my cousin does. And he's a fucking idiot. So you'll be just fine. I can't eat, I'm so nervous. What the Hell are you nervous about? I don't know. Well, if you're not going to eat it, can I have it? Sure. Remember outside when you asked what I was looking at? Yeah. Someone was staring at me. Who? He looked like James. James is in jail. Yeah, I know. And, even if by some miracle he got out, I doubt he could even walk. You burnt the guy to a crisp. Hey, are you sure you're okay? Uh, yeah. Are you taking your medicine? Yeah. Yeah... but? I'm still having those episodes every now and again. Jesus. Don't tell your parole officer or your doctor any of this. I won't. They'll throw your ass away for life. Do you think I'm going to be alright? Listen, you've been through a lot of shit. I can't even imagine what it was like. But you can't keep living in the past. You did your time. And what's done is done. You have to move on. Yeah. You're right. Everything's gonna be great. Come on. Let's get out of here. Hello? I'm glad you plugged your phone in. I told you I would.

Yeah, I know the song. Well... James would call me every time it rained and play that song over the phone. That's how I knew he was going to kill someone. God, that's so fucked up. Is that why you don't want a phone? One of the many reasons. You know, you're the only one who has stuck by me. I never would have been able to do any of this without you. So, thank you. You don't have to thank me. We've been friends since we were five. You're like family to me. I'll never turn my back on you. I know what everyone says about me. Yeah, well you know what I say to them? What? Go fuck yourself. Are you sure you want to work here? I don't really have a choice. This place is in the middle of nowhere. I don't like you being out here all by yourself. I'll be fine. What are you doing? I'm coming in. I need to see what this shithole looks like on the inside. Hi. Can I help you? I'm Mary. I'm supposed to start work tonight. Oh, right. Hi, I'm Bobby. - Hi. - Hi. And this is Deb. Oh, hi. Do you sell beer? Oh yeah. It's right in the back. So, Ed says this is your first time working in a gas station? Yeah. Okay. Well, it's pretty easy. So, you don't have to worry about a thing. Do you want to see what's going on back here. Yeah. So this is the cash register. And this is the scanner. You just scan the item. Press this button and this button. And when people pay for gas they have to come inside because the pumps are old and they're not automated. I'll take a pack of Spirits. Okay. Just make sure that you card because I got in trouble once for selling to a 12-year-old. You sold cigarettes to 12-year-old? She had boobs. So, it was confusing. Uh... Yeah, so you want to ring her up? Uh... uh sure. All right. And, is that debit or credit? Uh, is that debit or credit? - Debit. - Okay. That will be $9.75, please. See? Easy as that. Good job! - Thanks. - All right. Okay, so I'll get you a set of keys and I'll show you around the rest of the store. - Okay. - All right. He's kind of cute. For a guy that works at a gas station. So, are you going to stay here all night? No, I'm leaving. I just wanted to make sure everything was all right. Everything's fine. I'll call and check up on you later. Okay. And don't get too drunk. You have to pick me up at six. When have I ever gotten too drunk? Ok. Fuck! We only have five channels. That's fine. I'm not going to be watching that much television. You say that now, but by three a.m., you're going to be begging for some crappy TV show to watch. Trust me. Okay. Here are the keys to this store. This round one opens the front door, okay? So if you leave the market, you're going to have to use this to lock the door behind you. This thin one opens the back door and the bathroom door, and Ed likes to keep that door locked at all times. Okay? And what's that one for? What do you think it's for? Outdoor bathroom? You are a fast learner. Alright, I think that's pretty good. Uh, I think you're ready for your first night. Uh, it should be a slow one. Monday's are always slow. Mmmm. Just call me if you have any problems. Okay? Ed wants me to check in on you later on tonight, to see if everything's okay. Okay. Got anymore questions before I go? Uh... has this place ever been robbed? Uh, well... I mean... only by me. Now, you can eat and drink anything you want. Just keep your hands off, these babies are mine, and I have seniority. I'm okay, thanks. Ed never notices. Leave it in the dumpster out back. Uh, and if you smoke, do it outside. Okay. Well, I guess that's it. I'll see you later, Mary. See ya. I hate the rain. Ew, gross. The brain is ready. The patient is ready. Good. Ugh. Hello? Deer Gas Market, this is Mary. How late are you open until? We're open 24 hours. Thank you. Deer Gas Market, this is Mary. How late are you open until? Didn't you just call? Deer Gas Market, this is Mary. How late are you open until? You already... Do you like watching people die? Hey, this is Debbie. Thanks for Calling. Hey Deb, it's me calling. Could you call me at the number I left? I really need to talk to you. Get a grip. Shit. Hey. Hi. Is Ed here? No, he's not in until morning. Uh-huh. Uh, fill her up, diesel. Um... Is that pump number two? Yes ma'am. Okay. It's not a good night to be outside. I'll tell you that for free. I haven't seen you around here before. Oh, it's my first night. How do you like it? Yeah. It's good. So what are you? You a student or something? No. Well, it's about time they got someone pretty working here. So, why does a beautiful young woman like yourself work in a dump like this? 'Cause I needed a job. You should get a boyfriend to take care of you. I don't have a boyfriend. Oh. Now how come you haven't got a boyfriend? Because I tried to kill him. That'll be $159.75, please. Hot damn. I think I'm in love. Is that debit, or credit? Credit. If you ever get tired of not having a man around, you know, I'm always open 24 hours. Thanks, but I'm not going to be dating anyone for a while. Ah. What a waste of machinery. Oh, shit. Hey, hey, you forgot your credit card! - Oh! - Oh, my God. Oh, shit. What the Hell are you doing? I was screaming your name. I thought you'd hear me. I didn't. What are you doing out here? Someone forgot their credit card. God damn. Oh my God. Your lip is bleeding. Well, yeah, no shit. You punched me in the face. Sorry. Come on, let's go inside. Shit. That is some right hook you got there. I'm sorry. I thought it was somebody else. I'd hate to be that somebody else. Yeah. You would. Oh, I'm sorry. It's fine. It's fine. Sorry. So, what are you doing here? Ed said that he wanted me to come check up on you. How's everything going? Well, I've had one customer. You know him? Big, tall, bald-headed guy, drives a truck? That's him. Yeah. He left that here on purpose. Why would he do that? Well, because he fucked the last girl that worked here, until Ed walked in on them. Ugh. How could anyone sleep with that guy? He paid her. That's disgusting. He used to fuck her right there. Oh! So how is everything going? I'm fine. Ed told me you were in prison? Right. So that's why he wanted you to check up on me. Make sure I'm not stealing anything? No, he just want to make sure everything is okay. So? Looks pretty good from where I'm standing. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Why did you set your boyfriend on fire? I guess word gets out pretty fast. Do you really want to know? Do you want to talk about it? Not really. Yeah, okay. My boyfriend was, um... James Lincoln Fields. The Rain Ripper? Yeah. He killed like 30 women. 35. So I guess that makes you The Watcher. Yep. That's what the press called me. You watched all those girls get killed? Not all of them. How'd that make you feel? Like I wanted to die. I still want to die every day. You don't have to talk about this. No, it's fine. How did you find out? You know, that he was... Killing people? Can I get a sip of that? Thanks. I came home from work one night and... the house smelled really bad. I thought it was an animal or a backed up sewer pipe. So, I want down into the basement. And... it was completely flooded. The smell was... too much to take. So, I was about to go upstairs to get James. Then I saw. The body parts. That's when I knew. He'd been burying bodies underneath our house. And I turned around to get James. And he was waiting for me. That's how you knew it was him? I always thought there was something going on, but... like, I guess I didn't want to believe it. Gosh. What did you do? Nothing. I just let it all happen. Why didn't you run? Why didn't you go to the cops? He said he was going to kill me and my whole family. I'm not making excuses or myself, but... I was young and scared, and... I didn't know what else to do. He made me watch after that. What made you stop? Her name was Christine Rogers. She was so young. After that I didn't want to live anymore. So... while he was sleeping... I set the house on fire. With you inside? He's still alive, right? And why the rain? So their souls could be cleansed. I got really sick. I couldn't tell what was real, what was not. I was seeing the victims everywhere. How are you doing now? Good days and bad. But I'm getting better. That's good to hear. Could you, uh... Could you not tell anyone? I won't tell anyone. I think people are going to find out though. Yeah, I know. Look, I gotta go. - Okay. - You going to be okay? Yeah. Got any questions for me before I go? Does anyone actually eat those? Oh, these little things? Let's see here. Mmmm. Oh, ewwww. You don't know what you're missing. Oh, God. That's so gross. Thanks for the pig's tongue, Mary. I'll tell Ed you're doing just fine. Thanks. See you later, Mary. See you. Do you have a bathroom? Yeah, it's just outside. There you go. ♪ I'll take you ♪ ♪ Yes, I know you want it too ♪ ♪ I'll take you ♪ Shit. Fuck! Do you have ID? Sure do. Thanks, Tom. Not a problem. That will be $11 please. There you go. Thanks. There you go. Excuse me. Deer Gas Market, this is Mary. ♪ Raindrops ♪ Are you okay, Lady? Just to let you know your bathroom is totally flooded. Let's go. Shit. Fuck. Great. Help me! Why won't you help me? You're not real, you're not real. You're not real, you're not real, you're not real. You're not real. What are you doing here? I was driving by and I thought I'd see how you're doing? It's kind of late for you to be out, isn't it? I don't sleep much. Don't the phones work here? You know you really don't have to keep checking up on me. I'm not checking up on you. Ed called me and asked me some questions about you. Great. Did you tell him everything? You know what? Why don't you just send me back? Is that what you want? For your information, I told him that you were a good person caught up in a bad situation. And now trying to put your live back into order. Thanks. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm going to use the bathroom, where is it? The one outside's out of order. You'll have to use the one in the back. The thin key will let you in. Thanks. Can I help y...? Hello, Mary. You're not real, you're not real, you're not real. I'm real. I heard they let you out, so I thought I'd come see how you're doing. You still don't think I'm real, do you? Mmm. You still seeing things you don't want to believe? Well, you're just like me, Mary. You liked watching them die. I'm not like you. You're worse. You could have stopped me. But you didn't. You let people die. Innocent people die. I was sick. Still believing in your lies? Still. This is not happening. You will watch people die tonight. And I'll bet you 10 to one that you will like it. And then I'll watch you die. And there is nothing you can do about it. You know, my parole officer is in the back. You don't think I know that? Well, I'm going to tell him. Mmm. What if I'm not real? They'll put you away forever, Mary. I know you're not real. And I'm going to prove it to you. I'd like some gas, please. Sure. Can I have $10 on pump number three? Okay. It's really coming down out there. Yeah. And $10 is your change. Thank you. How late are you open until? Why do you keep calling me? What do you mean? You called me. Earlier. I know it was you. I'm sorry, do I know you? You know who I am. What the fuck do you want? I think you are mistaking me for someone else, dear. Don't you lie to me. I am on to you. - I am fucking on to you, lady. - Hey! What's going on? This woman has been calling me all night. I don't know what she is talking about. She's one of them. One of who, Mary? Okay, someone has been calling me and making threats. You think that lady was her? I don't know. Well, why didn't you tell me this? Because I'm paranoid and delusional. Remember? Well, you should have told me this. Look, you need to tell me everything and be honest with me. That's the only way this is going to work. You understand? Okay. It's late. Have a nice night. Thanks. Debbie? You've reached Tom Doogan. Leave your name and number. Tom, I need you to call me. I think something's happening. Please call me. 9-1-1. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Nothing's happening. Hello? This is Sam from emergency services. We received a call from this number? Sorry, I thought I hung up before I connected. Do you have an emergency? No, I didn't mean to call. Sorry. If you'd like to make a call... Fuck. You're not real, you're not real. Mary. Oh my God. Help me. Help me, please. Hey, settle down. We need to call the police. He's trying to kill me. Everything is going to be all right. You don't understand. Oh fuck. The phone's still dead. Do you remember her? She was 18 years old. She was a freshman in college. She was gonna be a doctor. But you and that monster, you took all of that away from her. I didn't. You watched him kill my daughter! When I heard they let you out, I just had to come and do something about it. No! No! Are you okay? Yeah. Is she dead? Yeah. I tried to call you but the phones are down. I know. She said that I killed her daughter. Her name is Carol Rogers. Her daughter was Christine. No. Is anyone ever going to forgive me? No. Fuck. What's wrong? We have to get hold of the police. Why did you come back? I have something to tell you. What? Come on we have to go. No, tell me what it is. There was an accident at the prison. What kind of accident? A major storm shut the power down. Some prisoners escaped. James was one of those prisoners. He's real. They didn't want me to tell you because they didn't think he would come after you. He was here. What? No. Don't. Please. I told you I was real. I'm sorry for hitting you. You okay? I've been watching you. I really thought that woman was going to kill you. Then Tom did me a favor. He killed her so I didn't have to. And now we're together again. Just like old times. What are you going to do? You know what I'm going to do. No, please don't. Debbie. You don't have to do this. Yes I do. I trusted you. And this is how you repay me. I'm not afraid of you anymore. You should be. No. Watch me, Mary. No. Watch! Watch me, Mary. No, no, no. Please, please don't. Please, please.

Debbie. Phew. You like to watch, don't you? Say it. No. You disappoint me, Mary. You like watching people burn, don't you? Fuck you. Soon we'll be together again. I will never be with you. Help me! Help me! Ed keeps a gun in his locker. What? In his locker, 37. It's right there. - Go get it. - Ok. Go get it before he comes back. The one with the lock. Do you have a key? No. Fuck. Mary, Mary, there's a pipe right there. There's a pipe right there. Hello? Shit. Hey, darling! You here? I forgot my credit card. Hey. See that little lever, on the top? That opens the rifle.

Just keep that rifle trained on the door. As soon as he walks in, pull the trigger. I won't die here. I won't fucking die here. I'm supposed to pick you up at six. Keep it covered. Keep it covered. As soon as he walks in, blow him away. Shit. Get ready. Come on, you fucker. - I shot him. - Come on. Oh, no. It's not him. I shot someone. It's not your fault. You didn't know. I did, I pulled the trigger. Give me the gun. And the shells. Come on. It's my fucking fault. If he walks through that door, I'll blow his fucking head off. No, no we can't stay here. We'll die. Come on. Stay close to me. How many rounds you got? Two. Okay. Okay. The Police are here. Yeah. Okay, let's go. Come on. Oh fuck. This is Officer Collins. I'm out on Old Cold Bank Road, Deer Gas Market, responding to a 9-1-1 call. Hopping out to have a look. Oh, please! Get on the ground! He's gonna kill me! - No, on the ground. - Please. Calm down. Is anybody else in there? Yes, he's coming. We need to leave now. Stand up. Slowly. Tell me what's going on. He's in the store. Who's in the store? James Lincoln Fields. He's coming after me. Get in the car. Get in the car. This is officer Collins... No, no! Hello? Hello? Hey! Stop, stop, stop! Hey, stop! Please, stop! Mary! Fuck. Stay with me. I'm not leaving here without you, Mary.
