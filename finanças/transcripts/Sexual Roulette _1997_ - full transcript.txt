This is the chance of a lifetime. - OK, so say we wanna get into this? Midnight's, the deadline, five grand minimum. - Gee, honey, you got five grand laying around somewhere I don't know about? - Well, there is money my parents sent us. We were saving on down payment for a house. - What? - Excuse us a second Chick. Jed, let's do this. - Are you crazy? - Just place the bet. We'll tell Chick we have the money in the bank. Even if we don't, the race is fixed. It's a sure thing. No one will ever have to know we never had the money in the first place. - It is kind of a good idea. OK, but now what if it doesn't work? What if the horse loses? - It'll work, I can feel it. Come on Jed, let's do this. - OK, let's go for it. You wanna do it. - Yeah. - Come on. OK, Chick, put us down for five- - $30,000. - You guys don't have that kind of money. - Yeah, yeah, we do. Yeah, we do. We just didn't want to, you know, use the money for the house. But if it's a sure thing, like you say, we will never have to touch it, right? - Nothing's ever a hundred percent. This is as close as you get though. (Jed imitates swooshing) - Let's go for it.

A sure thing, god I can't believe it. Look, you're in big trouble. You just better get all the bets. You got that? - I'm really sorry, Jed. - Yeah, well that doesn't do me much good now, does it Chick? I can't believe I'll let you talk me into this. You know, the minute that he suggested this, I said no, because I know Chick. I know that Chick is full of shit. And then you had to go and stick your nose into it and say it was OK to do. - It's not my fault, Jed. - It was a fluke, Jed, we all went down on this. - Look, I've got to be the biggest freaking idiot that ever walked on the god damned Earth. I should have known that my old buddy here, Chickster here, was involved, and I was going to get screwed somehow. And I did. - Now that you had your little tantrum, I hope you feel better, but I still need the money. - Of course, of course. You need the money, yeah. Yeah. - I assume you don't have it on you right now, so I'll give you to tomorrow morning to get it to me, OK? - That's fine, Chick. - So how about you meet me at the bar in the casino tomorrow at noon? - No problem. - I'm sorry. - Jed, I have an idea. - Honey, if I were you, just get as far away from me as possible, OK? Just run. Because he's gonna have men come and do things to me. I don't know. - I'm not you, Jed. I love you, no matter what happens. I think it's time we had some good luck. You're gonna have to trust me though. - Come on, come on. - Look, you said you had a plan, what is it? - Come on, come on, Jed. - What are we gonna do here? - I'd like to have this change into chips. - Where'd you get that? - It's our rent money. Relax, I brought it just in case I'm emergency. - How would you like that? - Honey, don't you think we've pressed our luck enough for one day? - Jed, just let me do this. I know we're gonna win, I can feel it. In $50 pieces. - Thank you. OK, we're gonna put all of this on red and we're gonna win. Then we're gonna double down and we're gonna keep winning. And then we're gonna go home and forget all about this terrible night. - [Croupier] Everybody please, place your bets. - Everything on red? - No, no, just do half. - [Croupier] All bets are final. - To black, black. Can I, can I still change the black? - Quickly? - I, I just feel Black. I feel Black. - Come on, come on, come on, come on. - Black, Black. Black, Black. - Come on Black. - Black, Black. (ball rattling) Ah shit! - [Croupier] Red 16. Red 16. - OK, OK, forget it. Gimme the rest of the chips, we have to win this one. Black. - Black, Black, Black, Black.

(pensive music) - [Clerk] Sir, this is not a pawn shop. - Yeah, I know, I know. Look, we got ourselves into a little bit of a bind.

Clearly bought in better times. - That was my grandmother's. - [Clerk] How much do you want for both. - I don't know, make an offer. - I'll give you $3750. - Three- - I know they're probably worth more than twice that. Tell you what, I'll just hold them for 48 hours. If your luck changes, come back and I'll let you buy them back for the same price. - OK? - Thank you very much. - Take some advice though. Use the money. Pay off whatever it is you have to pay off. Don't press your luck, this is Vegas. (ball rattling) - [Croupier] Red. 34. - Yes, yes! (Sally screaming) - [Croupier] And we have a winner!

I feel like playing a little blackjack tonight. - I can take you to your table. - Great. Oh, wait, that couple. I recognize them. What do you know about them? - [Roberto] They're causing quite a stir. - Really? How are they doing. - So far, they're winning. (sultry jazzy music) (gasping) Perhaps I'll play some roulette instead. (ball rattling) - [Croupier] All bets are final. Here we go. Red 17. - Yes. - Yeah. - Oh my God. - [Croupier] Congratulations. - $15,000. - That would've seemed like a lot of money 24 hours ago. - We've got 15,000 here, honey. - Yeah. - Good evening, Ms. Landis. How are you tonight? - Just fine. Jed, what is your favorite number? - My favorite number is lucky number 13. - OK, $10,000 on 13. - Oh, 34 Red. Sorry, Ms. Landis. - Oh, well I'd pay a lot more for a man like you. - I'm sorry, what was that? - Nothing. You two look like you've had a hard day. - We have. - Allow me to do you a favor. I have a few suites that are kept available for myself and my guests and I'd like to give you one for the night. - I don't know. Would you like to? - We still need $15,000 more, but I am kind of tired and I'd like a hot shower. Something along those lines. - OK, great, we'd like to. - Great, I am delighted. It's on the top floor. Have a nice night. (jazzy electronic music) (Sally moaning) (Sally panting) (Sally moaning) - Oh yeah. - What time is it? - Hmm? - What time is it? - I don't know. Oh, Jesus, one o'clock in the afternoon. - We were supposed to meet Chick at 12. - I know, I know. Let me call him, I just wanna make sure it doesn't worry. Hey Chick, hi, it's Jed here. Sorry, we missed you at 12 o'clock. We'll have the money for you by this evening, OK? I'm sorry about this, but I'll call you room back and let you know where to meet us, OK? Thanks. Bye. - What did he say, did he freak out? - No, he wasn't there. Left the message on his hotel voicemail. - So what do we do? - Get dressed. Go down to the casino and win 15,000 more dollars. (upbeat rock music) - Here we go. - Roll it! - Yes. - Snake eyes. That's it, buddy. - Where do we start? - [Croupier] Congratulations, place your bets. - OK, what we're gonna do this time, we're gonna be small portions and we're gonna bet smart. Hopefully we'll get on a roll pretty early and get the hell outta here. - Let's go. - OK, let's go, roll the dice. - Come on now. (dice rattling) (patrons cheering) - Yes, Ms. Landis? - That couple from last night, they're back on the floor. - [Roberto] I already noticed that. I'm on top of it. - Here we go, big eight! - You're kidding me, right? - No, I just had this little problem that I was gonna tell you about. - You're $30,000 short. - This guy and, and his wife, they took off on me. - Wait a minute. Is this the couple that was at the sports book at the casino? - It's them. (ominous music) - This is not good Chick. 'Cause I don't know where they are. They could be anywhere. However, I know where you are. (Chick yelling) Tell me where they are. - You're gonna break my arm. - That's the whole idea, talk to me. - I don't know. They were supposed to meet me at the casino by the bar. - First, you turned me on to that stupid horse race. And then you take a $30,000 bet and it walks. I gotta tell you something, Chick. I am really unhappy with you right now so you better think where they might be. - Stan, I swear to God, I don't know where they are. - I don't got no reason to keep you around anymore. - [Chick] Stan. I thought they were OK. - You thought wrong? Put him out of my misery. (punch pounding) (Chick groaning) (punch pounding) (Chick groaning) (slap popping) (Chick groaning) - Stan, don't do this. Please. - Shut up. - He's bad luck. I don't want to see or hear from that fuck ever again. Do it. (gun ratcheting) Do it. - Please don't. (gunfire booming) - Sherry, I was just taking care of business. So what can I do for you? - Well, actually, Stan, that's what I came to talk to you about, business. You miss me. - Sure. - Good. (pensive music) (jazzy electronic music) (pensive music) - [Croupier] Black 15, Black 15, sorry, folks. (pensive music) - We're broke. That's it. - I can't believe we lost it that quickly. - Well, we did. We got about about a hundred bucks left. That'll be about enough to get us back to Los Angeles. - We can't go home, Chick will kill us. - I don't know what else to do. - We can go to Florida. - No way, you can just forget about that. - I'll call my parents, they can wire us plane tickets. We can stay there until we get back on our feet. - Yeah, yeah, I, I can just see the look on your father's face when he comes to pick us up at the airport. That's self righteous prick. - Don't talk about him like that. What else are we gonna do? Can't go home. We certainly can't go to your parents. - I'll tell you what, I'll go back to Los Angeles and get killed before I take a god damn dime from your parents. Let alone live with them in Florida. - Well, what then? - I don't know, Sally. But yelling in my face is not gonna help. - I'm just trying to figure out our options. - Look, why don't you just leave me alone for a little while, OK, I gotta think. - Gladly, in fact, I'll leave you alone for a long while. How's that? - That's great. - Hello. - Hi, what you live here? - Practically? You don't look so great, is everything OK? - My wife and I just lost all of our money. We came in here, we thought we could win back enough money to pay back the money we lost at the horse races. - That's a bad idea, the odds are against you. - Yeah, but where else can you win $30,000 in two days? - I can think of a few ways. $30,000 isn't that much money. - Maybe not for you. - I can think of a way that you can get that kind of money very quickly. - Really, how? - Spend the rest of the night with me. In my suite? (Jed chuckling) - Yeah. That's a joke, right? - No joke. - No, I really couldn't. Nah. - Well. - Well just, just outta curiosity. Well how much are we talking about? - $40,000, payable at sunrise? - Well you know, you know I'm married. - I don't wanna know. Do we have a deal? - Are you serious? - Totally. You turn me on. - Well, I've never cheated on my wife before. - Well, if what you say is true and you're really need the money, well you're probably doing it for your wife in a way. Plus no one says she has to find out about it. Right? - She's staying right here in the hotel. You know that? - Well, I saw you two were in a fight. Why don't you just tell her that you spent the night out wandering around thinking. - $40,000. - $40,000, uh-huh. - OK. It's a deal. - I'm delighted. Come with me. (pensive music) Sorry I took so long. - It's OK. Why, why are you so dressed up? - Well, I'm paying for it, so I thank you to indulge me. - OK? - Is everything all right? - [Jed] Fine. - Take a look at this. - It's an incredible view. - Yes, it is. I thought it would be nice if we just relax, talk, get to know each other. Hope you're thirsty. - Yeah, you know, as a matter of fact, I'm very thirsty. - So, aren't you gonna tell me how nice I look? Hmm? - [Jed] You look very nice. - Thank you. (glasses clanging) - Can I ask you a question? - [Sherry] Of course. - [Jed] Why me? - That's a very good question. I don't know. Why are you with your wife? I mean, why are any two people together? All I know is that when I saw you, I found you completely irresistible. - That's very interesting, very interesting. - Are you hungry, can I ring for some food? - No, I'm sorry. Under the given circumstances. I don't think I could enjoy a meal right now. - Why, you're not comfortable? - No, I'm, I'm not comfortable. - Well, that's what the champagne is for. It's to get you loose so we can get to know each other, hmm? - Cheers. Tell you what. You invited to me up here to fuck you, right? Well, this bar looks very sturdy. Why don't you just climb up here and let's fuck, get it over with. What do he say? - I didn't say "fuck me." I said spend the night with me. And since I am paying, I will decide what happens when it happens, and how. Now, sit down. Figuring how desperate you seemed earlier. I really think that you could use another drink. Hmm? - Cheers. - Cheers. How about another bottle then? - Good idea. - You're, you're a damn beautiful woman. And I'll tell you what, if I wasn't a happily married man, I'd probably be enjoying myself right now. - Well, if you weren't married, then we wouldn't be doing it. That's the whole point. - What is? - Turning you on when you don't wanna be turned on? That's what every woman wants, to be irresistible. You mentioned the sturdiness of this. Well, I assure you it's a multi-purpose piece of furniture. (Sherry gasping) Touch me. - [Jed] I got it. - Undo my dress. - There you go. Oh boy. (door banging) - [Stan] Sherry, it's me. (door banging) Sherry, open up the door. Sherry, I'm gonna smash down this door, now open it up. - Come with me. - [Stan] Sherry, I know you're in there. Open up the door, now. (door banging) - Shh. - Who hell is that. - [Stan] Who's in there with you? - Stan? - Who the hell is Stan? - He's the guy that you owe $30,000 to. - What the hell is he doing here? What's he doing here? - I don't, I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna talk about it. Jed, make love to me. - But. - Just, just, make love to me, OK?

I guess. - I can't believe it, Just like that. - Yeah. It's pretty amazing, huh? So what I think we should do, let's get are stuff all packed up. Get ready to get the hell outta here and just forget that this damn thing ever happened, OK? - Fine. Let's go right now. - Oh, we have to wait cuz he's supposed to call. He's, he's gonna tell me like if it's OK to go back to LA, if it's safe. (phone ringing) - I bet that's him. Hello? - Hello Jed. It's me, Sherry. There's been a development, we need to talk. - I'm here with Sally. Is there some kind of problem? - I think it would be better if we talk down here alone. - Why? - I'm right near the front desk. I'll tell you when you get here. (Jed sighing) - What, what is it? - I dunno, there's a problem, Chick said, I got a call, I got a call from an outside phone. OK, what's going. - I need to talk to you. - Look, my wife is upstairs. You're scared to hell outta me, now what's going on? - I was upstairs making some phone calls and I spoke to Stan. Evidently, he's on some sort of rampage about the $30,000. You still owe him? - I told you I was gonna pay the guy. - You don't understand it, do you? Stan is crazy. He doesn't like to be walked on. - Whoa, what's that got to do with a thing? Like I told you I was gonna pay the guy today. I didn't walk on him. - I know, I know. - I told him that you were here, here and you're going back to LA shortly but he said it doesn't matter. It's too late. - Too late. - And Chicks been hurt. - How bad? - I don't know. And there's another thing. He said that because you've been late and you put him through so much trouble that you now owe him $50,000. - Jesus Christ. How can he do that, wow can he do that? A bet is a bet. I mean, you can't just go change it a bet like that. Christ sakes, I'm only two days late. How can he do that? - I think there's a way that we can work this out. - [Jed] How? - I can just give you the $10,000 in addition to the $40,000 that I already owe you. - You, you would do that for me. - Of course. If you'd spend the night with me again, I'd give you the money. - No, it's impossible. Sally's upstairs, she's alone, she's scared. I can't leave her alone again. - I think I've been pretty fair already. So what's it gonna be? It's just a night. - Ah, OK, look, gimme a couple hours. I gotta work out something with Sally. - See you in my room. - I'll call you, I'll call you. Fuck. (jazzy rock music) - What happened? - Well, let's go sit down. Chick said I have to go meet his boss. Remember that guy at the horse race, the big guy, Stan? - The real big scary guy. - Yeah, that's the guy. And Chick said he'll probably put me on some kind of a payment plan, but I have to meet the guy in person and I'm supposed to meet him in about 20 minutes. - What? Where are you going? - I don't know, Chick wouldn't say. - Jed, I don't want you to do this, it's dangerous. - Honey, what choice do we have? Look, I'll call you, let you know what's happening. OK, I'll, I'll be back, I don't know, late tonight, early tomorrow morning. - No! - Look, I'm just gonna go talk to this guy, Stan, and reason with the guy. Chick said everything's gonna be OK. - Oh, I can't believe it. And you believe Chick? - Yeah. - Well, I can't take it. I'm leaving. You can do whatever you want. - Sally, Sally, would you just stick with me a little while longer, honey. OK, look, I swear to God after tonight, everything is gonna be OK. - Jed, I'm just really scared that something's gonna happen to you. - I know, everything's gonna be OK though. I'll be fine, Honey, I love you. - Jed. - Look, I gotta go. I'm really sorry about this. - [Sally] OK? - [Jed] I love you. (pensive music) - Things are gonna be a bit different tonight, Jed. I've got some excitement planned for us. Would you get this? - What? - You want me to tell you now or do you want it to be a surprise? - I'd like you to tell me now. - Well, you're a very handsome man. So we're gonna go downstairs and you're gonna seduce a young lady of my choosing and then you're gonna bring her up here and make love to her while I watch. How does that sound? - It sounds like I'm not gonna do it. - [Sherry] What? - What? What if Sally sees me? And besides our agreement was that I would spend the night with you, not somebody else. - I'll be there, Jed. And our agreement doesn't prohibit the company of others. He wants you to invite your wife. She's really very hot. I know I'd like it. - You can forget about it. - I'm ready, let's go. - Stop pretending you don't like it. (sultry electronic music) Wait, her. - Her? - Yeah, her. (slot machine chiming) - OK, so, so what do you wanna do? You gonna walk up to her and say , "Hi, why don't you come upstairs for a threesome?" That's not gonna work, Sherry. - Don't underestimate yourself, she's hot. Just do it. I'll be right over there, if she agrees to it I'll meet you up in my room. OK? Just pretend I'm not there. (sultry pensive music) (slot machine chiming) (date chuckling) - There I was sitting on the other side of the casino and I saw you sitting there and I thought, "What the hell?" You know you are a very beautiful room. - Thanks. Wow, this is a really nice room. - Should I give you the tour? - Sure. - OK. We got the lovely spacious living room. The baby grand piano, do you play? - No I don't. - The bar and the great panoramic view of Las Vegas. - Do you mind if I sit down here? - I don't own the seat. - Of course you don't. Seven and Seven please. - [Bartender] Coming up. - The only reason I ask is I don't wanna sit here If it's gonna bother you. - It doesn't bother me. - What happened, did you lose your shirt? - No, my husband. - Excuse me. - Nothing. - Can I buy you a drink? - [Date] This is really nice. - [Jed] I've got a great view over there of the city. - [Date] Oh, this is a beautiful view. - Yeah, it is. It's, there's the, The Strip over there. Oh, we got the bed over here too if you would like to bounce around a little bit. - Maybe later.

Are you married? - Yeah, but I wish I wasn't. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. We can talk about something else. So what do you do? - I'm one in a million outta work actresses in Los Angeles. - Yeah. I think it's gonna happen for you sooner or later. You strike me as a winner. - Thanks. I guess it doesn't mean much since you've only known me for half an hour, but thanks. - No, it means a lot. I know people, that's my job. - What did you say you do again? - I'm a filmmaker. Not your kind of films though. I'm a documentary filmmaker. - So you shoot elephants in the wild, stuff like that? - No, no, no, I only shoot people. They're what interests me. I study interesting people. And that's why I came up and talked to you. I've just about had it. I won me $300 tonight. So I'm want to go back up to my suite. If you'd like to join me for a nightcap you're more than welcome. - I don't think so. - OK, here's my card. It has my number on it. Give me a call sometime.

Do you two know each other? - Yes, she was paid to be here, much like you were. I must admit it was amazing. - [Laura] I'll see you Sherry. Anytime you need me, I'm available. And it was nice meeting you. - Yeah. Why'd you do that? Did you think I'd be able to pick up a woman on my own? - I just wanted insurance that my fantasy would be fulfilled. Jed, I have some things that I have to tell you. - What. - I lied to you about Stan. (pensive music) - About what? - He never said you owed him many more money. I made that up. - Why? - When I want something, I make it happen. Like with you. I wanted you, so I made it happen. I wanted you for another night and then I made it happen. And Chick is dead. - Chick is dead? - He didn't pay your debt on time. - You're, you're telling me that you created this whole thing for your own amusement? - Yeah. Wasn't it fun? You know, the thing is, I want you again. Huh? - Get off me. - Jed. - Get off me. And I want my money, I want it now. - It's in the drawer. But you know what, Jed? You can't resist me, you want me? I just want you inside of me, come on. - I want my money and I want it now. - You can have your money, it's right here. - Get it for me! Get it. You can have it anytime you want. (Sherry giggling) Be rough with me, Jed, be rough. - You'd like that? - Yes, I do. - You like that? - You can have it. You can have your money, yes, you can have it. - You want it? - Oh god, just do it rough. - You want it? (Sherry exclaiming) - I do. - Yeah? - You know what? (Sherry gasping) Let me tell you something. This is all for my entertainment because I don't like to be bored, Jed. - Shut your mouth. Shut up. (jazzy electronic music) (Sally chuckling) - Why you being so nice? - Oh, I guess I'm just a nice guy. (Sally giggling) - Really, I have no ulterior motives. Otherwise, I would've made a pass at you by now. - That's not what I meant. I can tell you're a perfect gentleman. - So tell me about this husband. He seems like a real mystery man. - Lately, he is. We got ourselves into a bit of trouble recently. - What kind of trouble? - I don't wanna talk about it. You know, sitting here talking with you, John, I'm beginning to remember what it's like to just relax and have a pleasant conversation with someone.

You're supposed to be out. - So Sally, it's not what it looks like. I can explain. Hi, Sally, wait! Sally, wait! Sally! (Sherry laughing) Wait up. (Sherry laughing) Sally wait. - No, get away from me. - Sally, would you wait? - No! - Goddammit, wait! - Let go of me! - You're gonna wake everybody up. - I don't care, you have picked, Jed. Let's go of me! - Let explain what's going on. - What possible explanation could you have for that? (Sherry chuckling) - I saw an opportunity and I took it to get us out this god damn mess. OK? Now what the hell are you doing in here anyway? - I got a note telling me to come. - Oh, that's, god damn bitch. - It's not what this is about, Jed. What scares me is it if I hadn't found out, you never would've told me. You had no intention of ever telling me. I can forgive you for cheating on me, Jed, but I can't forgive you for lying to me. I can't trust you, so what- - Sally, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sally. OK, like I'm sorry. - I'm going back to LA. - No, where are you gonna go? Where you gonna go? - Go back to Florida. Don't, Sally! - Get away from me! - Sally! Ah, Sally! (pensive music) (Jed grunting) Oh man. - Were you able to patch things up? - What do you think? - I just wanted to see how far I could take it. How about now? Would you consider getting in bed and making mad, passionate love? - Right now I wouldn't even spit in your face. - Well, I guess I've taken it to the outer limits. You did more for money than I thought you would. You know, I suppose when you have a lot of money, well you just forget how desperate those without can be. - Yeah, well, what I did I did for my life. That guy Stan might have killed my wife and I. - That's true, he very well might have. That's only why you agreed in the beginning. I know men and I know that when you were with me, you enjoyed it. I'd even bet that you were turned on by the fact that you were being paid for it. - Yeah, maybe I was. But still, you didn't have to be so cruel to my wife, Sally. - Look at it this way. That's $20,000 more than you thought you'd have. I could even take it one step further. Maybe I'll just call Stan and he'll squelch the whole bet. That'll be $50,000 all to yourself. - No, forget about that, OK. I'll tell you what, I don't need any more favors from you. I'll just take my $50,000 and I'll pay off my bet and then I'm gonna go back and buy back something that I had to sell. OK? I'll tell you what, gimme my money and I'm outta here. - Good luck. (doorbell buzzing) - Sally, what's wrong? - I need a ride back to LA. Do you think you can gimme one? - Of course. Why don't you come in to get a few hours sleep First. I am very attracted to you, but. Whoa, careful, careful. I don't wanna do this if it's gonna be something you end up regretting. - John, I won't regret it. (reels booming) (slot machines chiming) (jazzy electronic music) (Sally sighing) - [Sally] Yeah. (Sally moaning and panting) (pensive music) - Hey, I know it's been more than two days, but do you still have the rings I left here? - Yes I do. - Oh, great. I'd like to buy 'em back. - However, I did have an offer on those rings. It's gonna cost you $10,000 to get them back. - How much? - 10,000. - 10,000 dol... - Take it or leave it. - What? Bastard. - Sally. Sally. Sally, you here? Sally. Sally. Where the... Shit. Sally! Wait! Where the hell you going? - I told you where I was going, Jed. Leave me alone. - Who the hell's this guy. - It's John, my ride. - Look, you're going back to Los Angeles, Sally, I'll give you a ride, OK? - I don't want you to gimme a ride, Jed, I want you to leave me alone. Sounds like you found your calling in life. - Oh, don't be like that. - Jed, I loved you so much. I would've have done anything for you. But that's it, it's over. I don't want you in my life anymore. - I got the rings back, look. - I don't want it. Stop it, Jed. - Sally, I said I was sorry, OK? - Sorry doesn't cut it. John, let's go. - Excuse me. Hey, I think the lady's made her feelings clear, don't you? - No. - Yeah, I think she has. - [Jed] I don't think so. - Hey. - Whoa, hey, hey. Take it easy, man. I got your fuckin' money, all right. Here, here. Don't touch me, here's your 10,000 here. Here, $30,000 , we're square. - Thanks. But you don't owe it to me, you owe it to her. - To Sherry? - [Sherry] Jed, you don't look so good. - Yeah, well my wife just left me. Thank you. - Well, maybe it's for the best. - What's this guy talking about? - What, I didn't hear what he said. - He says I don't owe him the money, I owe the money to you. - Oh that, that was just one little thing that I neglected to tell you in my revelation to you last night. Stan works for me. I'm the one taking the bets. Stan's just a collector. - And what about the other night in your room when he was pounding on the goddamn door? - I guess I'm a fairly decent actress. (both laughing) It's all a game. High stakes bluff, I guess you got bluffed. - So you're telling me this whole thing was a a setup. You, you made this whole thing up. - Yes, it was, all constructed from my amusement. Life is boring, Jed. And I just hate to be bored. - Excuse me, but I'll meet you back at the office. - [Sherry] So would you like to have dinner with me tonight? - Yeah, sure, why not? - You mean to tell me that you'd spend the night with me for free? - Yeah, well, I don't have anything else to lose? - You know what, I'm really not interested anymore. I thought it was fun when you weren't interested in me. But now that you are, you seem so desperate. - You know you are such a bitch. - You see that couple on the roulette wheel? - Yeah. - They've been losing an awful lot of money. - Yeah, so what? - He is really quite attractive. I wonder how bad it's gonna get for them. Hmm, they lost again. Too bad. (pensive music) - Hey Mister, you got a buck? - How about a hundred? - A hundred, you must be a millionaire. - No, just a writer. Got a great idea for a screenplay. - All right, thanks a lot, man. - No problemo. - Excuse me. - Sure, here, I'll get that for you, Elvis. - Thank you, thank you very much. - My pleasure. (jazzy electronic music) Yeah! (pensive music) (sultry electronic music) (pensive music) (jazzy electronic music)
