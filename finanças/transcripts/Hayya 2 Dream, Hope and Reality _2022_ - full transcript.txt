Where is she now? She's gone. Why? Since she's gone... ...I don't have a best friend anymore. And there's no one... ...I take to the strawberry garden with me. Don't be sad, Embit. You have me now. Later, I will take you to... ...here. The Mosque? Al-Aqsa Mosque, Embit. I really want to go there. Al-Aqsa Mosque... ...is one of the beautiful Mosques, Embit. On Isra' and Mi'raj back then... ...Prophet Muhammad... ...before he was brought by Angel Gabriel to Heaven... ...it started from Al-Aqsa Mosque, Embit. Ride a buraq... ...from Masjid al-Haram... ...as fast as lightning. Yeah, I've heard from Ustadz. I want go to Al-Aqsa Mosque too. Right, Embit. My mom said... ...that one day... ...I will meet mommy and daddy... ...in Al-Aqsa Mosque. Hayya. Me and Hanna had one more friend. His name is Leon. Leon is Hanna's favorite doll. Then where's Leon? Hanna once told me... ...if she's gone... ...she wanted me to take care of Leon. But... So, you took Leon? No, aunty. Don't lie. I have heard that. No, I don't know. Embit. Hanna... ...stop playing with Embit from now on. He takes people's things without permission, it's not good. Okay? Honey. Now I know who took her doll. That's Embit. I was thinking... ...that you're the one who burned it. Or maybe... ...he took it from the garbage can. The place where you burned Hanna's things. Honey, let's not have this conversation again. Hanna already has a new toy. It can't be like that, honey. Favorite items can't be replaced. But, honestly... I don't like if Hanna still playing with Embit. I'm worried if she's become bad... ...just like Embit. Honey, please don't talk about that, it's not good. Hanna enjoyed playing with her new toys. She was also not looking for Leon. Dear ladies... Treasures... ...families... ...and our beloved people... ...are not ours. Everything belongs to Allah... ...and back to Allah Lafz al-Jalalah. Then... ...what is our attitude as the faithful... ...if one time Allah takes... ...what we loved? We have to be... ...sincere. Sincere to all the will... ...and destiny of Allah Lafz al-Jalalah. Allah Lafz al-Jalalah said... ...in surah al Baqarah verse 155. I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the accursed. "We will certainly... ...test you... ...with a touch of fear... ...and famine... ...and loss of property... ...life... ...and crops." "But give good news... ...to those who patiently endure." What is the fruit of patience? The fruit of patience is... ...heaven. Heaven. That's why all of us... ...should improve our good deeds... ...our prayers... ...and if God wills, we'll be resurrected... ...gathered... ...in Ard al-Mahshaar (Land of Gathering)... ...as lucky person, if God wills. Amen. Excuse me, Ustadzah Dewi. Where is the location of Ard al-Mahshaar? Because... ...my husband is Minangnese. I swear. There's no place with the name "Ard al-Mahshaar." That's interesting question. So there's interpretation... ...about where's Ard al-Mahshaar. One said, it's on... ...other side of the earth. One said, it's in other world. Ustadzah... ...is it other world such on TV? No, no... It's a place... ...that we've never known before. I got it. There are also said... ...that Ard al-Mahshaar... ...located in Palestine. A place where all people... ...will resurrected... ...gathered on the judgment day. This is reinforced by hadith... ...that one time... ...a women come to the Prophet Muhammad... ...and asked the Prophet. Prophet, give us a statement... ...what is Baitul-Muqaddas. Then the Prophet Muhammad answered... ...that Baitul-Muqaddas is a place... ...where all of us the human... ...will be resurrected... ...and gathered. Ustadzah, is it Baitul-Muqaddas... ...located in Al-Aqsa Mosque? Yes, that's right. Ma'am, don't stop learning... ...and don't forget to invite all your sisters. Yes. - Thank you, Ustadzah. I will go first. - Right. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Ustadzah Dewi. Yes, Mrs. Astri. Honestly, I really am... I don't know about Ard al-Mahshaar. I just know Padang City. Padang Sidempuam... ...and Padang restaurant. Because I've only recently relearned the religion, Ustadzah. Ma'am, you still learn about religion is really great. - The important thing is consistent. - Yes. Because with knowledge, if God wills... ...we can survived in this world and the afterlife. Amen. - You should come here often. - Amen. At least three times per day... ...so I will get smarter. Ma'am, just like drinking pills, three times a day. The important thing is, the intention. If you want learn about religion to get pleasure of Allah... ...just do it slowly. Amen. Ma'am, I will go first. I have to go to obstetrician. - My husband had waited there. - Right... ...four. Very productive. You tease me. - I go first, ma'am. Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you, too. Ustadzah... She's good in preaching... ...also very productive. Ms. Lia. Ms. Lia. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. Ms. Lia, I'm so glad to see... ...your happy face now. Your face is so glowing... ...similar to the filters on your phone. You're too much. Ms. Lia. Is true what Ustadzah said. We have to let go... ...the death of our family... ...especially our own children. What do you mean? You were great. Even though Hanna had been dead a few weeks ago... ...but you're so tough. If it happen to me, I can't take it... ...I will be sad and cry a river... ...and won't go out. But you're so tough. - That's great. - Who died? Hanna. Ma'am, don't talk carelessly. Hanna's still alive... ...you could ask your kid. What does it mean? And I want to tell you... ...tell your kid... ...to not tag Hanna along... ...to engage in dirty play. I need to pick Hanna up. Excuse me, peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, too. What does it mean? I'm confused. Did I say something wrong? Or did she eat something wrong? Hanna, please eat it. This is your favorite fish dish. Also this mixed vegetable that you liked. Eat. Hanna. Eat this. Eat this! Hanna! Is up to you if you won't eat! Hanna. Hanna. Don't be angry with Hanna. Poor her. I feel upset with her. I already cooked her favorite food... ...but she doesn't want to eat. Be patient, honey. You must be patient. I'm confused about her. Why has she changed a lot? Not the same Hanna, who I know. Everytime I talk to her... ...she never answered. She went all silent. That's making me confused. I don't know what I should do. I think it's all because she played with Embit... ...Mrs. Astri's kid. But, do you love Hanna? Hanna. I'm so sorry. I'm angry with you, not because I don't love you... ...but I just don't want you to feel ill. I'm so sorry. If I take you on vacation... ...do you still angry? Where are we going, Dad? What if we go to the mountain? No, we go to the beach... ...that's Hanna's favorite place. We go there quite frequently... ...let's go to the mountain instead. No. Let's just go to the beach. Would you like to go to the beach? And I'm so sorry. Do you forgive me? Now we put water in the bottle. Okay. Put in here. Oh no, it destroyed. Again, try again. Then, we do this... We make a hole for the water. Do it. And put it this side. Can you do it? Oh, no... Hanna! Daddy. Let's play again. Dad, come here. - What are you making? - I made a mountain. I will make a flower. Hanna, wait for me. I'll splash down on you. I'll splash down on you. Oh no, Leon. You promised... ...to give your time for us. But why are you still thinking about your job? You're selfish! Hanna? Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! Honey, what's wrong? Why are you pale? I guess it's because you haven't had breakfast. Let's eat. Let's eat. Okay. Come. Yummy? Eat with rice. Let's eat slowly. Hanna! Hanna! Hanna! I seek forgiveness in God, Hanna? Hanna! - Baby? - Hanna! Honey, what happen with Hanna? Hanna... Wake up, Hanna. Hanna? Hanna... Why is it going to be this way? Don't worry, honey. Hanna is a strong girl... ...and she's going to heal. How? Any progress for her? She's still unconscious. Ma'am and sir, please wait outside... ...we'll do the treatment. Let's go, honey. This rash... ...and blisters on her face and body... ...are due to allergic. No way. She never had allergic... ...and lobster is her favorite food. Sorry ma'am. That's impossible if someone has no previous allergic... ...with what her eat. And then out of nowhere... ...got this severe allergic. And... I have checked all Hanna's lab result. And... ...it's shown clinically... ...that's true... ...she has an allergy to seafood. And there are more dangerous things. She is shortness of breath because her allergic... ...it's getting worse... ...because we found... ...foreign object in Hanna's lungs. Foreign object? What does that mean, Doc? Please take a look. We found a lot of iron... ...and aluminium flakes in her lungs. How can there be that kind of flakes... ...in my daughter's lungs? Only both of you can answer it. During this time... ...what she did? Hanna never did something wrong. Even if she's just playing around... ...she's just at home, in garden... ...never goes anywhere. And it's impossible there is that kind of flakes in her lungs. Honey... Here's the thing... This case... ...usually found in children... ...whose living in conflict or war area. Such as Palestine for example. They could have been inhaled... ...as a result of bombs or grenades of war. And... There's no other plan... ...we should do the surgery for her. Hello? Rahmad? You bastard! You've been hiding Hayya from me. Rahmad, what happen to you? Istighfar, Mat. Hold your anger. This is hospital! If something happens to Hayya... ...I'm gonna kill you. Be patient, honey. Doc, how about Hayya's condition? Who are you? I am her parent. How about Hanna, Doc? The surgery is done... ...but Hanna is short of blood. Her condition still critical. Take my blood. Her blood type is AB negative. It's impossible... ...our blood type is O. Not, ma'am. Her blood type... - ...is AB negative. - No way. She's not Hanna, but Hayya. We need help. We need help... She needed to find a blood donor who matched her blood type. And we also ask other hospitals for help. - Doctor. - Lia. Please, I beg you... - ...please save my child. - Lia... She's not Hanna, she's not our child. - Doctor... - Hanna was... Lia, Hanna was dead. She was gone, honey. She was gone. Hanna... Yes. Hanna was... Henna was dead? Honey... Honey... Lia... Hanna... Hanna was dead? Yes. No... Lia. No. Lia... Lia. Lia. Lia! Lia! Hanna. Oh my goodness, I am late. Lia. - Lia. - Why you don't wake me up, honey? We don't need it again. We don't need again, Lia. What do you mean? What if Hanna is late? Lia... Hanna. - Where is she? Hanna! - Lia... - Hanna? Ouch! - Lia. She must be at Embit's house. Lia. Lia, where do you go? Lia. Lia. - Lia, what are you doing? - Hanna! Hanna. - Hanna. - Lia! Hanna. - Hanna. - Lia, enough! Coming! Hanna. - I seek forgiveness in God. - Where's Hanna? - What's going on? Hey... - Hanna! - Hanna! - Why you barged in my house, Ms. Lia? - Hanna! - Lia. - Hanna. - Lia. - Hanna! - What happen? - Enough Lia, enough... - Where's Hanna? - Hanna was dead. - No! She isn't dead yet. Because of you... ...my child being cheeky! - Where's Hanna? - Lia! - Let my son go. - Stop it. The doll, where is Hanna's doll? Stop it, Lia, I said stop! Hanna was dead. Hanna was gone. No! She's not dead. Enough. I said, enough! The child that you think as Hanna is not our child. I'm sick of lying to you. I am tired. I always follow your wishes. Not only were you sad over Hanna's death, but so did I. I beg to you... ...you have to let it be, honey. You have to let it go, honey. No... No... Laugh if you want to. Laugh as much as you like it. It's okay if it makes you satisfied. Laugh! Lia, please... Enough. Enough, Lia. Lia. Enough. Lia, enough. Lia! Oh, Allah, why? Oh, Allah, why was she taken from me? Ustadzah, why Allah takes my child? Miss. This is a trial from Allah... ...it's sign from Allah that Allah really loves you. And you must remember that Allah never gives a trial to someone... ...beyond the capacity of Allah's believer. You can definitely get through it. But why should I, God... ...why should I? I never do something bad. Miss, I seek forgiveness in God. Istighfar. You have to take a look. Allah sent you good people around you. They're good people. It's not only you who feel lost... ...but also your husband. Look at your husband, he is strong... ...and still accompany you, right? And if God wills, Allah will give you a better replacement. If God wills. Oh, Allah... I seek forgiveness in God. Forgive me, honey. Forgive me. Forgive me. Daddy. Hayya. Come here my daughter. Mother. Daddy. Mommy. Hadijah. Hayya... It's not time for us to gather yet. Stay there... ...take care of our homeland. Give happiness... ...and give peace... ...to those around you. We'll meet again... ...if God wills. Goodbye. Mommy... Daddy... Mommy... Hayya. Hayya. We will certainly test you with a touch of fear and famine and loss of property, life, and crops. Give good news to those who patiently endure who, when faced with a disaster... ...say, "Surely to Allah we belong and to Allah we will all return." Al-Baqarah verse 155-156
