"I love him...i want him so much..." "yet tonight everything will be over..." "From today on she'll be all mine..." "It's a pity this is the last time we're together." "We'll be living better in Europe..." "The last time...the last time" - I'm happy...really happy. - I feel happy too. - You know you have the most beautiful eyes i've seen? - And you're the most beautiful girl. What do you think, should we take a ride to the city? - I just wish to see it one more time before we left. - Your idea is excellent. - Ready? - Yes, we can go. - Did you take everything? - Yes. - Let's go. - Look at it, you like it? - Yes! It's all ours, my gift to you. - Did they leave the place? - Yes just now. They headed this way. - Fine, you go this way, me from the other side. - OK Let me go, help!! Help! Let me go, where are you taking me! You bums! Let me go, help! I told you to let me go! Where are you taking me! Help!! Police... Attention, a kidnapping of a young woman was alleged at the end of highway 28, verify and report! I tried to get their license number but didn't make it... I had dropped my glasses and didn't have the time to wear them. I got up, went to a phone booth and called you. Are you sure you got her real name? I have her passport and our tickets with me. We were about to leave for Italy this morning. I'm afraid you'll have to travel by yourself. If your friend dared approaching airport security...she would fall right into our hands. - Excuse me? - I think I was pretty clear. Are you telling me that...she's wanted? Yes, and it won't be easy for her to get away this time. But what for? She's been wanted for some time regarding Snowden's murder. You must have heard of him. Major businessman, economist, and a political player. Yes I think I read something in the papers. I'm sure that you two met long after the crime. That's right...i met her on the street...she didn't have a place to stay. And so you gave her a place. You should know that I haven't regretted it at all. - Not even now? - I don't believe any of this.. I'm sure there's been a mistake. She couldn't have done something like that. Marie Snowden, the victim's wife, may be able to change your mind. If you give her a call she'll be glad to meet with you. That's exactly how the story goes... I hope you understand. I hope you forgive me...you had to remember all this because of me. What can be done? Everything is over anyway... now you're the one who's in a rough spot. - Would you like me to help in any way? - No...thank you. - This way. - Thank you. My husband...let me introduce you to him. Come. - Hi dear. - Hi. - How was work? - Excellent. This is my husband Dario, here's mister Crispini. - Happy to meet you. - Are you in a hurry? - I have a plane to catch. - I thought you would postpone your trip. Sadly there's nothing I can do. This is all a Police matter now. Have a nice trip then, good bye. - Good bye. ...i repeat: Mister Mario Crispini should please contact Information Office. Hi, i'm Mario Crispini. - Your passport please. - Yes. There's this letter for you. - From who is it? - I don't know sir, I just got here. - Ok, thank you. - You're welcome. Mario...what you're about to hear was meant only for you. Don't wait for me...i won't be able to come with you. When you'll be in Italy, and hear all that I have to say... then you'll understand why things turned out this way. Yes? Yes..fine, i'm coming right now. - I'll be at the airport. - Yes sir. She must have left the tape before any of this happened... maybe the day you bought the tickets. - The important thing is what she mentions. - Did you listen to it? That's why I called you. I suppose you'll be taking the next flight. That depends on your decision, after you hear what she had to say. Mario, i've told you lots of lies about me. But now's the time for you to know the truth. I'll tell you my story from the beginning. I came here from Greece to study. My relatives sent me to a couple they knew...the Snowdens. He greeted me himself at the airport, so as to drive me to their home. After checking out, I saw Snowden waiting for me by himself. It all looked normal to me...i could never imagine how important that meeting was for me. The look on his face when he saw me was really strange. As if...as if he was trying to confess about something. And his hands...they were constantly trying to reach mine, during the whole trip from the airport to their house. I think you're pretty familiar with the Snowden case. But you don't know about the part she played in this affair. She didn't hesitate becoming the husband's lover right on her first day of her arrival. In the car he would ask me all sorts of questions about my family and Greece. Though he refrained from asking any personal questions. He informed me that his wife couldn't be there because she was taking music classes, with an excellent teacher. I have an idea. Why don't we play something else. - My husband, be quick! - Put on your clothes. Here we are... Come in... Let me introduce you to my wife...here's Alice. - Really happy to meet you. - Me too, how are you. - I'm fine. - And here's a very good friend of ours, Dario. - An excellent musician. - Happy to meet you. - Hello dear...how's everything. - Fine. Here Alice, let me show you to your room, come with me. - I hope you will like the room, it has a view to a marvelous lake. - Of course I will like it. - This way. - Thank you. From the first moment I knew Dario disliked me, I couldn't understand why. Snowden on the contrary kept close to me at all times and he was trying to keep me happy with everything. There was only me for him...everyone else was just secondary in his every day life. I admit that this situation was really strange. I was never before in a similar position. He would accompany me in long walks and look really happy. - I have an idea, should we go for a walk? - Fantastic. - It's a very beautiful lake. - I knew you'd like it. - Hi Captain! - Good morning Sir. - Come in. - Thanks. - Take us to the other side. - Yes sir. - Are you happy? - Yes, very. - Good morning madam - Good morning, would you please help with this? Now it will be harder to get rid of him, don't you think? The girl is complicating the situation. On the contrary, it's better now. What do you mean, Dario? Now that he's in love, he'll inevitably make a mistake. Apart from his phone, i'll be bugging his bedroom as well. Then i'll try and get the girl on our side. I don't think I understand. Look...it's not easy. But her presence here will definitely be helpful to us. You keep promising that we'll be over soon with this but you never do anything. It is your turn now...you'll make the first step and i'll follow. - I'm worried... - Why? - Your wife... - What did she do to you? - I don't think she likes me at all. - And why would that worry you so much. - I don't feel comfortable at all. - Even when you're with me? Not at all...when i'm with you everything is great. Let's go inside. One night that Snowden was busy in town, I discovered something that I was suspecting from the beginning. Dario was his wife's lover. The next day he was there to drive me from the university. I had decided to tell him everything I saw the previous night. But I changed my mind the last moment. I didn't know if I should tell him or keep it a secret. I was sure of one thing...he definitely knew everything. - Look, it's your wife's friend! - And why do you care. Don't you see...he's taking pictures. Just act like he's not here. - What's that? - It's the film I took from his motorcycle. So that you wouldn't worry a bit. What if he discovers it? - Don't worry about this at all, it's not easy for him. - I hope so. One day when I returned home I found Dario bugging Snowden's bedroom with a tape recorder. I don't understand why they do it...why do they wiretap your room. - It's really simple, they need evidence against me. - But why? I don't know, they're trying to find a way to get rid of me. Shouldn't you take some precautions. Of course...and I shall do it right away. I couldn't see everything.. I'm sure I will find something myself. If you excuse me... Dario, i'll be expecting you tomorrow in my office, I want to talk to you. Don't you want to talk to me right now? No...i'd rather talk to you tomorrow. So...i'm listening. I have to announce to you that my wife decided to quit her music classes, so you won't have to visit her anymore. She wanted me to tell you about her decision. So I hope you forgive me.. I tried to change her mind, but I didn't manage it. May I ask what was the reason. Sadly I don't know, but it's easy to understand that she's a woman with lots of mood swings. It's not the end of the world anyway. I wouldn't say that either. Yes, you're right. I now understand that...you've also grown tired of us. I would prefer if no more comments would be made on this. Excellent, Dario. I also apply your tactic in such occasions. I must congratulate you, for showing that you're a civilized man. Your civilized manners will oblige you to behave in the most dignified way, and you won't be in our way with any phone calls or letters, otherwise you'll have to deal with me. I believe that you're overblowing things. Now listen... I think I was pretty clear to you. I don't think there's any point to be clarified. Everything will depend on your behaviour, I hope this is the last time we see each other. That stands for me and for my wife as well. So you think that all these words will force me to go against what I stand for? I'm glad I was that clear. So get out of sight. And leave my wife alone or else you'll be in trouble. - I swear I had no idea about his decision. - I know...i believe you. He'd never ask for a divorce...a scandal could destroy his career. And if he had all the proof, and his witness, he could send me to jail. What are we gonna do, my love? Let him enjoy his little girlfriend for the time being, and we'll soon find a way to straighten things out. - Even if we'll have to risk everything. - I'll be by your side. Yes...i'd like to speak with the Police. Police? There's been a crime by the end of regional Highway, number 43. Yes...exactly. I see you're having fun. Terrified, I started wondering all over, trying to hide in a world that was strange and unknown to me. I chose to run and hide away, thinking that otherwise i'd have the same fate as Snowden. It never crossed my mind that they would accuse me of murder to the Police. I will see you later. I have to verify the new clues...i'll be waiting for you at my office. Miss Snowden, I absolutely need your help with this. As you understand, your testimony will be of decisive value to us. And now miss Snowden... I'd like you to describe all the facts in great detail. I don't have any clue about all this. I'm not sure about anything. The only thing I know for sure is that I was hosting a monster in our house. Are you sure she was the one that shot him? Yes...absolutely sure. - Please be sitted. - Thank you. - Did you find her? - Not yet. But we did find the murder weapon in the house's garden. My people also discovered this tape recorder while searching the house. So Alice wasn't lying after all. Right...this discovery verifies her version. It turns out that your friend had confessed the whole truth. So what are you going to do. If the murder weapon that was found in the garden, turns out not to belong to Snowden, but instead belongs to her current husband, something which miss Snowden insists on denying, obviously trying to protect her new husband, then the whole case will take a new turn. Of course all this will be clear in a while, when we'll have the results from the forensics department. So if it's proven that the girl is telling the truth, then i'll do everything to help her. Let's listen to the rest, maybe she's giving some clues about her moves. I kept hiding...i didn't know what to do. I was just hoping the Police would discover the truth and I would be over with this ordeal. Meanwhile I was careful not to become noticed...i would hide anywhere. So one day I got into another nasty adventure. - What happened? - Stay down. I told you to leave me alone, where are you taking me! - Stop it. - Why? Beat it. Now you're mine, so cut it, no reason to be afraid. Why being so selfish? What's the matter now, do you have any objections? So you're smarter than us? That's what I think. I could say I was a bit lucky. Steve took me away from them and got me to his house. Why didn't you tell me this from the beginning? Tell you what? That you're the one who offed this pig, ain't that right. No, it's not true! Let me explain to you... - Yes? - Listen... Didn't you get tired after all these hours, loverboy? - Don't forget that we have business too. - OK, don't you worry. We'll meet tomorrow at 2 o'clock precisely, in our usual place. 2 o'clock sharp. - Right. Police...tomorrow there's gonna be a robbery at the 'Cavalier' company, at 2 o'clock. Yes, Terry? Can you write down the number you were asking me before? Hey miss...if you're a good girl you won't get hurt. Put the money in the bag...come on, fast! Freeze, Police! Police! Stay still and surrender, no funny games! Drop your gun! Hello. Some cops got your buddy Steve...but don't you worry, you're with me from now on, right baby? - He'll give you the money first. - And if he doesn't? - You'll bring it back and i'll be dealing with him. - And how will I recognize him. He'll be carrying a guitar. Jimmy sent me. I know. - OK then? - He said to give me the money. - Later...i'll send them to him. - I'm sorry... It can't be done. So you won't give it to me? Sorry I can't. So you don't trust me. Please stop it. Stop it? I don't know anything about your business. You know what's inside there? No, why should i. - Are you playing dumb? - Well what is it. Morphine. If I could disappear for some time...i would give it to you, - and I would vanish. - So you want to get away but you're afraid of this thug. - No one can help me get away. - Come with me. - Where to? - Trust me. What if he finds us? There's no way he can find us. Out of the question. - So are you coming with me. - Where to? We'll ride my motorcycle and go stay at my farm. It's some 500 km from here and it's a really great place. I also have lots of horses there you know... It's really lovely...you'll like it. It won't take us long to get there...everything is different there. There's so much calm and serenity... anything you'd wish for will be within your reach. Each moment you'll be able to enjoy the blue sky, the sunset, the trees... the nature. Everything is so fantastic there... I really like you, you know that? Me too. - What are you doing there! - Please let me go!! So Mario, that day you saved me from death, and gave me back my will to live. You made me able to love again... I'm never going to forget you. Although I can imagine what followed... I have to ask you to go over the facts again. She didn't hesitate coming to my house. It was only natural since she didn't have where to stay. She was desperate. She begged me not to tell anybody about her. Especially the Police. - Why did you do it? - Can I have a cigarette? I asked you something...won't you answer me? It's better if I left, don't you think? I believe you're not thinking straight... it would be better if you open your heart to me. You shouldn't leave... I feel responsible for you. You'll feel much better if you rest a while. It's just a matter of time. Are you a doctor? I'm finishing my practice in Psychiatry in a few months. It will help you. Thank you. I'm disappointed...i don't have one friend. Nobody. I don't have a job, and nobody will help me. You don't have a family? I lost my father long time ago. My mother... once she lost everything at the casino... she killed herself. And I was left all alone. I can feel you. I'm very familiar with loneliness. You live alone? I came here from Italy...my parents live there. Don't you miss them? Yes, a lot... I'll go live with them once I finish here. I envy you. That's how we started, officer. I didn't know much about her life. We met and we fell in love, I never had any idea about her actual life. She had a strong desire to change her looks. I didn't find it strange...i considered it something normal. But now I understand there were deeper reasons for that change. - Dario, I saw Alice. - And what did you talk about? I think this is pretty serious, and please understand there's no place for your jokes. We must do something. If she's alive, she'll be a constant danger to us. I never hesitated to do anything for you. I killed your husband...and I would do it again. We got what we wanted. I wonder how is it possible not to see the danger, Dario. Won't you ever calm down? - Yes? - Listen, Miss Snowden... I have an exclusive information. That might interest you. It depends on the information. You'll be the judge of that. I have some exclusive leads you know, regarding the young lady that murdered your husband. What would you say about a meeting, since you're in the position to give me details. The days would pass full of enthusiasm and love. My feelings for her were getting stronger, and I did everything to make her want to live again. Her future next to me looked carefree and happy. Why did you do that, tell me! Because he's going to help me, while you refuse. What did you promise to pay in return? I'll give him whatever he asks, even my own body. - Alice! Where are you! - What happened? - I did it! I finished! - Mario! - My love... - I wish you the best... I'm so happy...i'll see my home again. What's the matter? I won't be leaving you here. - Won't you come with me? - Yes, if you want it. I wanted her to come with me, and I would give her all the happiness she had missed in her life. That's what I believed, and that's what I wanted. Everything turned out differently... everything went dark again, as it was. Two thugs took her away from me. I'm feeling lost since that moment. That is all. You know it. What sort of comedy is this, what do you want? Sit down, I will explain to you. - I assume it will interest you. - I want to talk to my lawyer. And tell him what, that you killed Snowden with this piece? You don't know what you're saying, good bye! You can't leave. - Bring the lady in. - Yes sir. Now calm down and sit. Did she spill her guts to you? But maybe she should tell you what kind of trick she played against Alice. - Shut your mouth please, I assure you I didn't say anything. - I know you too well, you can't fool me. - The lady here was really interested in planning Alice's kidnapping. - Stop it Dario! - Shut it! - Don't get excited please, we know exactly what happened. Your wife didn't tell us anything, Alice did. Everything is recorded on those tapes....take him in! You, bring the gentleman in. Now speak, what did you do with the girl. Hi there, beautiful. Not feeling good? Where were you planning to go? You liked the guitarist better? What did he promise you, love? You have to understand that it's not easy to get away from me. Pay attention. I'm going for a walk cause I have a headache. When I return... we'll have a talk, the two of us. Keep an eye on her. Quick, you guys, on your right!
