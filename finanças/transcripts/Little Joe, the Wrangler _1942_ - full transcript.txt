[orchestra playing] [orchestra playing] [orchestra playing] [gunfire continues] I tell you, gentlemen, unless something is done to stop the ore robberies in this vicinity, my company cannot go on operating the smelter. But if the smelter, closes down, Mr. Chapin, us miners'll all go broke. -I realize that, Dawson... -[miners clamoring] but facts are facts. The smelter cannot operate without ore. Well, if Sheriff Brewster would attend to his job, we wouldn't be in this fix. Why don't he bring in some of the bandits that's holding up the pack trains and killing the miners? -[miners clamoring] -Now, just a minute. Just a minute! Well, now, you're doing a lot of talking, Travis, for a man that hasn't lost anything. After all, the outlaws haven't bothered you or your mine. That's because I got plenty of men to protect my pack trains. Some of the smaller mine owners aren't so well off. That's right, Sheriff. It's come to the point to where we can't get guards to work for us. [miners clamoring] I know that! I know what you men are up against as well as you do. I've been Sheriff of this county for five years, and I've never failed yet to keep law and order. And I won't fail now. You've been saying that for the last two months. I'm in favor of forcing Sheriff Brewster to resign and putting another man in the office... -[miner] So am I! -a man that'll do something besides make a lot of promises. [miners clamoring] Gents! Gents! Please, just a minute! Just a minute! We didn't call this meeting to put a new Sheriff into office. I, for one, have complete confidence in Bob. Yes, but you're not in the mining business, Corey. Maybe not, but if it wasn't for my bank, a lot of you miners would have been out of business a long time ago. I stand to lose as much as anyone else if the smelter closes down. I agree with Mr. Corey. The Sheriff is doing the best he can, and I'm positive if we leave him alone, he'll round up the outlaw gang that's been causing us so much trouble. Every businessman in Lamplight's got money invested in mines around here, and if the Monarch Smelter closes down, that means the county'll go bankrupt. If Sheriff Brewster can't get some action in the new few days, I think he ought to resign. [miners clamoring] Don't worry, Bob. We're for you. Thanks, Chapin.

[laughs] What are you-- Let me out of here! Murder! Help! H-Help! Whoa! Help! Get me out of here! [laughing] Help! Help! Get me out of here! Somebody, help me! Help! [laughs] [groans] No. That was... [laughs] H-How am I gonna get up from here? Toss me that rope up, and I'll give you a hand. Ah, sure. I see. Here you go! Here we go. Hang on. Tried to murder me, huh? Well, I ain't gonna turn my claim over to you, no matter what you do. Ah, keep your shirt on. I don't want your claim. [laughs] Well, what do you-- What do you know about that? That-- That you didn't come here to grab this mining property. That's right. A-And you don't want to kill me? Well, if I had, I wouldn't have saved your life by shooting that rope in two. Huh. I'm sorry, mister, but I thought you was one of them outlaws that have been shooting down prospectors around here. [laughs] Thanks for the compliment. Well, you can't always tell from the label what's on the inside of the can. Now, you take me, for instance. Maybe you wouldn't think it, but I'm a great inventor. Yeah. That's quite some contraption you've got rigged up there. You like it, huh? Well, you ought to see the others. And that ain't all. Say, I used to be the best top hand in the whole durn county. Little Joe the Wrangler's what I was known as. Eh, as a matter of fact, I still am, ridin', and ropin', and brandin' for the Brewster outfit. Man, I was there. Let me tell you something. Up at dawn and in my saddle afore the bunk spring started squeaking. [laughs] When did you turn miner? I'll be goldarned if I know. [chuckles] What are you up to? I'm pullin' up stakes right here and now. I'm sick and tired of being a square peg out of water, or is it a fish in a round hole? [laughs] Besides, why should I go on working this claim when nobody thinks it's worth murdering me for? [chuckles] Well, I guess I'll be moseying along. I got to be in Lamplight before dark. Say, if you ever stop off at the Lazy B spread, look me up. I'm going back and help Bob Brewster wrangle the law. -Yeah? -He's the Sheriff of this county. Right now, he's in a pretty tough spot with all that gold stealing going on. Yeah, I've heard about that. Say, with me on the job, he's a cinch to catch the bandits that's raising a ruckus around these parts. I used to be the Marshal of Deadwood. I cleaned that place up in no time. [braying] [laughs] Eh, I don't doubt it. Well, see you later. So long. So long. You hadn't ought to done that, Mildred. He was believin' me. Sounded good, bein' a Marshal. I never could learn to do that. Doggone it. [orchestra playing] What is this, Travis, a stickup? Call it what you like, Hammond. We want the gold ore you're carrying. Come on. Get down. Hyah! Hup! Hyah! [gunshot] [orchestra playing] [gunshot] [gunfire] [metal clanks] Put 'em up, mister. Get his gun, Larkin. Webb Hammond, shot right through the heart. You ought to know. You killed him. I reckon the townspeople will figure different. Uh-huh. Just as I thought. Four shots fired. Right recent, too. Quite a little frame-up you've figured out, isn't it? Capturing a murderer isn't called a frame-up in these parts, mister. Tie him on his horse, and you and the boys start back to town with him. -I'll bring the wagon. -Come on.

Not so good, sis. The miners had a meeting. I was told if I didn't get some action, there'd be a new Sheriff in my place. Ah. Well, don't let it bother you. You're doing the best you can. I know if they just leave you alone, you'd find out who's behind all these robberies. Well, thanks, Mary. I'm glad somebody believes in me. [laughs] [spurs jingling] [hooves clopping] -Well, howdy, Janet. -Hello, Bob. Say, is this a social visit, or have you sided in with the miners and want me to resign? [laughs] I heard about that meeting, but I don't think it amounts to much. You still have an awful lot of friends in this town. Bob, I'm worried about Granddad. I expected him back from his claim early this morning, and he hasn't shown up yet. Well, he might have stopped in town. There's nothing to be upset about, Janet. But he sent word for me to stay home, he'd struck it rich, and he was bringing back some new high-grade ore with him. Oh. Well, if it'll make you feel any better, Janet, I'll ride in to Lamplight and look around for him. Oh, I'd appreciate that an awful lot, Bob. I always worry about Granddad when he travels about alone. Well, if he's not in town, I'll send one of the deputies out to hunt for him. Thanks. [overlapping chatter] Whoa. -[men clamoring] -What do you got there, Charlie? Oh, I got one of them guys that's been robbin'. -He's tied up. -[chatter continues] Come on, killer. What do you got here, Charlie? This is one of them hombres been stealin' ore. We saw him shoot Webb Hammond in the back. -[overlapping chatter] -Hold on! -Let's get a rope! -Now wait a minute! Here comes the Sheriff. He'll handle it. [crowd clamoring] -Aw, get a rope! -What's going on here? Break it up! Break it up! Clear out! This hombre killed Webb Hammond. Come here. I'll show you. He tried to steal the ore out of Hammond's wagon. You better come with me, stranger. -[Larkin] He's not going-- -Break it up! Break it up! -[crowd muttering] -All of you! I'll take care of this. You know we got to have law and order in this town. This is a frame-up, Sheriff. I didn't kill Hammond. Yeah, Sheriff. You got the wrong man. He ain't no killer. He saved my life this morning. We'll talk about that later. Right now, I think he'd be safer locked up in the jail. You bring the horses, Little Joe. [man] Let's hang him up. I didn't kill Hammond, Sheriff. Travis and his men did it. That's for a jury to decide. We haven't gotten too much evidence against that stranger. He's apt to be troublesome if he's turned loose. Take the horses around back, Joe. Oh. Get me the coroner, Mike. Didn't take much to get that mob started. Let's go to work. -[men clamoring] -Hold up. Let's take the law in our own hands, gents. [clamoring] Did he give Hammond a chance? No. He shot him down in cold blood. Now, you hotheaded galoots, I never saw the stranger before in my life, but every man's got a right to a fair trial. Go on, boys! Let's break down this tin-can jail! [all yelling] [mob muttering] That mob's sure on a r-rampage, comin' down that street like they mean business. -Sheriff, where's the killer? -Hand him over. Get out of the way, Sheriff. The law'll take good care of the prisoner. Now get out of here, all of you! Get out! Let's rush him. [all yelling] Grab that hitching post. Break the door down. They're getting a battering ram. -Lift high! -[clamoring] Heave! I should have stuck to mining. Why don't you let him out, Sheriff? He ain't guilty. I got to do something. And heave-ho! I don't believe we stand a chance of holding that mob off. Say, if you give me your word not to escape, I'll send you out to my ranch with Little Joe 'til this blows over. Sure, I'll give you my word. [all yelling] Let me have a gun, and I'll help you stand off that mob. Be no more killing, if I can help it. Joe, I'm making you my special deputy. You can depend on me, Sheriff. You take care of this hombre 'til you hear from me. [all yelling] Out the back. Uh-oh. Psst. Psst, psst! Come here, boys. Why don't you come on through the window? You can sneak up on him from behind and surprise him. [laughs] Ah! Let that be a lesson for you. Hey, let me out of here! [Charlie] Hey, Joe! Let us in! Hey, come back here! Hey, Travis, get us loose! The Sheriff let him go! -Sheriff let him go? -What'd he do that for? Where is he? Try and find out. That's what we're here for. Now wait a minute! Just a minute! Wait! All of youse, wait! Taking the law into your own hands is only going to make matters worse. As Sheriff of this county, I'll handle the law my own way. I know where the prisoner went to, and when this town quiets down enough so that'll be safe to bring him back here, I'll have him in that cell again. Now get out of here, all of you! Get out! You better be telling the truth, Brewster, because if you aren't, we're putting a new Sheriff in office that'll run things the way we want 'em. [mob muttering] We've got to get rid of that stranger while he's still under suspicion Then we'll be free to operate until we make our final cleanup and get out. Two-to-one, Brewster sent him out to the ranch. That's right. The Sheriff did say he knew where he was. Why don't you boys take a little ride and see? [grunts] [yelps] [all laughing] Eh, boy, look here. [laughs] I fooled you, didn't I? [laughs] What happened, Joe? You all right? Sure, I'm all right. See that? That's one of my new inventions, Little Joe's cowhide cactus protector. [all laughing] [Little Joe] Go ahead and laugh. Kinda clever, huh? It certainly is, Joe. But what are you doing here? I thought you were mining. Well, I was up until this morning. Say, Miss Mary, I'd like to have my old job back again, that is, after I get through being a special deputy. [laughs] You, a deputy? Well, yeah. Bob just made me one. Oh, hello, Miss Janet. How are you, Joe? Doing fine. Uh, say, uh, this is, uh... Neal Wallace. Can you imagine me forgetting? That spill must have made me loco. Mr. Wallace, that's Miss Mary Brewster, the Sheriff's sister and the real boss of the ranch. How do you do? And this is Miss Janet Hammond. -I'm glad to know you. -How do you do? Hammond? Yes, it was her grandfather. What about my grandfather? Something's wrong. I know it. He was taking a load of ore in to town, and-- and a gang of outlaws attacked him. Then, he's dead? Oh, where's Bob? Why didn't he come in with you? Oh, he'll be along, soon as he breaks up that mob. What mob? Some of the folks in town got the idea here that Neal was to blame for Mr. Hammond's murder, so he-- Bob arrested him. Well, then, why isn't he in jail? 'Cause he ain't guilty. He's a real gent. Bob didn't dare keep him in the town, on account of the lynching mob, so he deputized me to guard him. Certainly made a hit with them, didn't I? Aw, shucks, I wouldn't worry none. It'll come out all right. Yes, sir, that thing should work. Hey, what sort of contraption is that, anyway? That's what I call my Little Joe safety shield. I'm getting sick and tired of being tossed off of my horse every time he stops, so I just figured up a little invention here to hold me on. It looks kind of complicated. Oh, it ain't, though. Yeah, I just-- I just put it there on my saddle horn, tie her on real tight, you see, and when I'm just about ready to stop and I'm getting going good, you see-- -Ohh! -[laughing] Well, that's what-- That's it. That's what it's supposed to do, you see, supposed to hold me on. It'll do 'er, too. Say, you just stay around a little close here, where I can keep an eye on you, and I'll show you how it works on a horse. I hope it works better than the last one. That-- Aw, lookie here. Come on. Come on. Come on. [hooves clopping] Say, Bob, I was just about to show him how my safety shield works. Wanna see it? Some other time. Come over to the porch. I wanna talk to you. I suppose Little Joe told you what happened in town, Janet. Yes. This man, is he really responsible-- No one is guilty until proven so. I didn't get a chance to question you in town. Suppose you do a little talking now? To begin with, I'm Neal Wallace, Vice-President of the Monarch Smelting Company, from the main office in Denver. You mean you're connected with Lloyd Chapin's plant? [Neal] He works for us. For the past few months, the smelter's been showing a loss. The company naturally wonders why. The miners have lost plenty, too. Every time they take a shipment of ore to the smelter, it's stolen. I didn't know about that until this morning. Well, go on. What else have you got to say? That's about all, expect I came to Lamplight on a matter of routine business, to check over the books of the smelter and try to find the answer to the decrease in profits. I'm sure that Lloyd Chapin is above suspicion. He personally has advanced money to many of the small miners, and everyone in town thinks highly of him. Well, the company thinks highly of him, too, or they wouldn't put him in charge of the Lamplight plant. If you're Neal Wallace, suppose you prove it. Certainly. My papers of identification are in my saddlebags. I'll do the looking. Well, there are no papers in here. Somebody must have stole them. Say, where'd you get this gold ore? Gold ore? Did you ever see it before, Janet? Yes. This gold came from my grandfather's claim. Why, I'd recognize this quartz formation anywhere. I never saw it before. Whoever stole my papers must have planted it there. Do you expect us to believe that? Why, you're nothing but a thief and a murderer. [hooves clopping] They look like Travis' men. Looks like they're gonna be trouble. You girls better get in the house. You give me a gun, I'll help you out. Well, I'm not gonna fall for that. I promised to take you back to town to stand trial. Gonna keep my word. Now get moving. [orchestra playing] [Bob] That's far enough, men. Get their guns, Joe. What's the big idea? We're after that killer. You're not after anybody, Larkin. That's my job. Well, you sure got a lot to learn, Sheriff. When the miners hear what happened today, they're gonna be plenty sore. I'm not asking you hombres how to run my office. Now turn around, and get going, and don't let me catch you outside of town within the next 24 hours. You take care of things around here, Joe. I'm goin' after that fella. [orchestra playing] Well, I reckon you've got me this time. Maybe. Maybe not. You're gonna listen to me from now on. All right. Go ahead and talk. But get this straight. You're gonna stand trial, no matter what you say, if you don't use that gun on me. I'm perfectly willing to stand trial. If necessary, I can get the President of the Monarch Smelters out here to identify me. But, right now, I'm worried about what's liable to happen until I do. I've got to get to the bottom of this situation in a hurry. All I want of you is a parole for a few days. Oh, is that all? Well, now, wouldn't I be smart, after all that's happened? Why, the people of Lamplight'd run me out of town on a rail. I suppose, if I were in your place, I'd feel the same way. Tell me, what does Ben Travis do for a living? He works a gold mine a few miles out. What about the other three men? They work for him. Does he take all his ore to the smelter? Well, I suppose so. Most of the miners around here do, but what's that got to do with me? You'll find out. As soon as I can convince you, we'll work together. Sorry. Not a chance. Suppose this'll help. Well, th-that stops me, Neal. I guess you are paroled. Thanks, Bob. I don't mind telling you I'm riding to Oreville. I wanna send a telegram. That's exactly what I want you to do. And send it to Wiley Comstock. He's President of the Monarch Smelting Company. How 'bout coming along with me? No, but I would like you to do me a favor. Tell Joe to meet me outside of town near the smelter. I can use him. [orchestra playing] -Oh, good afternoon. -How do you do? -Is Mr. Chapin in? -I believe so. Tell him Mr. Wallace is here to see him. Oh, yes, Mr. Wallace. Go right in. Thank you. Mr. Chapin? That's right. I'm Neal Wallace, Vice-President of the Monarch Smelting Company, from Denver. Well, this is a surprise. We've been writing to each other for a long time. I'm certainly glad to meet you. -Sit down. -Thank you. What brings you out here? To be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Chapin, your reports for the past few months have been showing nothing but losses. I was sent here to find out why. Well, as Vice-President of Monarch, there's no reason why you shouldn't learn all the facts. I rather imagine you have some sort of identification with you, Mr. Wallace. Oh, not that I doubt you, but we've been having a lot of trouble in this district. I naturally want to use every precaution to safeguard the interests of my company. I don't blame you, but unfortunately, my papers of identification were stolen. You'll just have to take my word for it that I'm Wallace until I can communicate with Mr. Comstock, the President of the company. Well, that's bad. Unless you can show me proper credentials, I'm afraid there's nothing much I can do to help you with your investigation. Why don't you wire Mr. Comstock? He'll verify my statements and give you a complete description of me. A very good suggestion. The nearest telegraph office is in Oreville, 20 miles from here over the Sawtooth Trail. Meet me there around noon. We'll send the wire and wait in town for a reply. Good. Thanks for the cooperation. I'll see you in Oreville. Send Travis to my office, Helen. Well, here's another 100 ounces I held out of last week's ore run. Good. I'll put it in the old boiler room with the rest of the stuff. That makes close on to 5,500 ounces we got stashed away. These identification papers mean just what they say, Travis. The man we framed is Neal Wallace, Vice-President of the Monarch Company. Hmm. Pretty smart of me, huh, havin' the boys swipe the papers out of the saddlebags and substituting the ore? That's playing both ends against the middle. The folks of Lamplight are really gunning for him. Yes? Well, he's just been here. What? Why didn't you let me know? Me and the boys would have taken care of him in no time. No, I've got a better way of handling him. He's out here to investigate me, and I can't let that happen. He's on his way now to Oreville by way of the Sawtooth Trail to wire Comstock. I savvy. I'll get the boys and take a little ride. After today, I don't think we'll be bothered with Mr. Neal Wallace. [orchestra playing] [Little Joe] Hey. Yeah, I been worried about you. Yeah? What about? Well, that outfit that framed you, I just saw 'em ride up to the smelter. -Well, I didn't see 'em. -Well, no wonder you didn't. They went in the back way. Well, if they were going to the smelter on mining business, I don't see why they didn't use the front door. That's why I was worried about you. Them birds is up to no good. I have a pretty good idea you're right, Joe. I'm taking the Sawtooth Trail to Oreville. The Sawtooth Trail? Yeah. What's the matter with it? Well, everything, uh, and then some. In the first place, it ain't been used in ten years, and, in the second place, it's ten miles further than the road. Well, I'm still taking that trail, and I have a hunch I'm going to run in to a little ambush. An ambush? Well, uh, say, are you sure you're feeling well? I never felt better. And I think I'm gonna have some fun, too. Well, how do you like that? Being waylaid by a bunch of cutthroats ain't exactly my idea of having a little fun. Heh. I'm sure glad I ain't in on it. You are, right in the middle of it. I-I am? While I ride the trail, you're gonna keep your eyes open from the ridge above. And, if you see anybody stop me, I want you to unlimber that rifle of yours and start scattering a little lead. That'll give me a chance to make a break. Well, sure wished I'd have invented a b-bulletproof vest. What's the matter? Are you scared? Afraid? Sh-Shucks, no. I ain't afraid of man nor b-beast. All right, then. And remember to keep your eyes open, and don't let me out of your sight. I will. [orchestra playing] [Little Joe] Hyup! [coughs] [Neal] What a nice, friendly country. Everywhere I go, I run into you birds. None of your lip. Who told you I was headed this way? Never mind. We're taking you back. You're wanted for murder. I guess that just about fixes them up. I told you I wouldn't let you down. [orchestra playing] Hey, I reckon that's what you call teamwork, eh, Neal? All right. You get up there on your horse. Get up there, you big tub. [keys jangling] You can't do this to me. I wanna see my lawyer. I'll get you a picture of him. [laughing] There's no longer any question about it, Neal. You were right to figure that Chapin was mixed up with the Travis game. He's the only one that knew you were goin' to Oreville by way of the Sawtooth Trail. Not only that, he suggested I use that trail. I'm positive that he and the Travis gang have been robbing the smelter. Now my next job is to prove it. Tell me, did-- did you send that wire? Yes, I did. Comstock's answer ought to be along any minute. It can't come in any-- too soon for me. ♪ As I was walking One morning for pleasure ♪ ♪ I spied a cowpuncher A-ridin' along ♪ ♪ His hat was thrown back And his spurs were a-jinglin' ♪ ♪ As he approached He was singing this song ♪ [all] ♪ Whoopie-tai-ai-oh ♪ ♪ Get along, little dogies ♪ ♪ It's your misfortune And none of my own ♪ ♪ Whoopie-tai-ai-oh ♪ ♪ Get along, little dogies ♪ ♪ You know that Wyoming Will be your new home ♪ ♪ Now it's Early in spring ♪ That we round up The dogies ♪ ♪ At markin' And brandin' We never fail ♪ ♪ We round up The horses ♪ ♪ Load up The chuckwagon ♪ ♪ And then Throw the dogies Out onto the trail ♪ ♪ Whoopie-tai-ai-oh ♪ ♪ Get along, little dogies ♪ ♪ It's your misfortune And none of my own ♪ ♪ Whoopie-tai-ai-oh ♪ ♪ Get along, little dogies ♪ ♪ You know that Wyoming ♪ ♪ Will be your new home ♪ [hooves clopping] Howdy, Miss Mary. Is your brother around? Why, no. He's in town, Clem. Well, I got an important message for him. Seems to me like he ought to get this one real quick. Hmm. What does it say, Clem? How should I know? I haven't read it. You sure you haven't read it, Clem? The envelope isn't sealed. Sweat, that's what unsealed it. Do it every time. What's an important man like him doing in these parts? What do you mean? What important man? Vice-President, of course. Vice-president of what, the United States? Heck, no. He ain't that important. This here fella is the Vice-President of the Monarch Smelter. -Monarch Smelters? -Neal Wallace? [Clem] That's him. Uh, do you folks know him? The description fits Neal perfectly. Oh, any time you got something, you want it kept real confidential, just tell it to me. I'm reliable, I am. Oh, he's reliable, all right. Say, Janet, Bob's gotta get this telegram right away. Well, let me take it to him. All right. I'll change my clothes and meet you at the office. You go ahead. [orchestra playing] I ain't talkin', and you can't make me. You work for Ben Travis, don't you? Oh, that ain't no secret. Why did he try to dry-gulch me? All right, I'll tell you. Chapin sent you to kill me so I couldn't identify myself. Eh, try and prove it. Maybe we will. You're too smart for your own good. What about Hammond's murder? -Huh? -You shot him, didn't you? I, uh-- No, no, no! I-I didn't do it! He done it! I know different. I ain't guilty. I didn't do nothin'. Rope dancing isn't very pleasant, Charlie. It's kinda tough on the neck. [breathing heavily] I'm wise to you. You can't trick me into squealing. Chapin would-- I thought you said you work for Ben Travis. What about Chapin? Come on. You should have been a lawyer, Neal. I am. [humming loudly] [trills] Whoo! Whoo! I got it all figured out! [titters] I'm a bird! I'm a bird! -[laughing] -Today, during that fight, I figured just what make birds fly. I'll be flying off of one of these buildings pretty soon. You watch. It'll work. Well, Joe, if it doesn't work, I'll promise you the finest funeral that Lamplight can afford. -Thanks, Bob. -[laughing] Funeral? Well, look, if you bury me, take me out someplace, and dig a hole, but don't tell my wife where it is, because I want to live in peace when I'm dead. -[sighs] -[laughing] Say, did that court order come yet? Yeah, the judge made it out this morning. Good. We'll pay Chapin a little visit. -Come on. -Fine. Hey, Joe. Keep an eye on him. Don't let him clip your wings. [laughing] Say, Charles, now, no monkey business. You heard what he said, keep an eye on you, and that's what I'm gonna do. The only difference between me and you, outside of you being in there and me out here is... the great separator. Now, Charles... [chuckles] Joe! Where's Bob? Oh. Uh, who, Bob? Oh, uh, him and Neal rode out to smelter just a little while ago. That's why I'm keeping an eye on the prisoner. -Thanks. -You're welcome. You sure bungled the whole deal, Larkin. Why didn't you and Norton go back and keep Charlie from being caught? Yeah. If he talks out of turn, it'll be too bad for us. The ambush was your idea, Chapin. It ain't our fault if it backfired! [wagon jangling] Forget it! You called me out for not getting him before. I can drop 'em both! We're not killing officers of the law. Now, all of you, get out of here. Go on. I'll stall 'em. Well, what happened? I waited in Oreville for you, and you never showed up. You never even started, but your gang did. I don't think I understand you. You sent them to ambush me. Why, you're crazy. Only one person knew I was taking that Sawtooth Trail, and that was you. Why, I've been with the Monarch Company for many years. My record is unquestioned. You mean it was. When I get through, your record book will have a lot of black pages in it. I've tried to cooperate with you and give you the benefit of every doubt, pending word from President Comstock, but this is too much! I'm amazed at you, Sheriff! This killer, this imposter should be in jail. I demand he be rearrested at once. Well, I'm sorry I can't accommodate you, Chapin. Oh, uh, we have a court order to look over your books. I hope you don't mind. Why should I mind? Go right ahead. [orchestra playing] I don't seem to find anything that's wrong. Of course not. Everything's in order. -[knock on door] -Come in. Pardon, Mr. Chapin, but there's a lady to see you. She says it's very urgent. All right, Helen. I'll be right out. Keep on making yourselves at home. If you can't find what you're looking for, why, let me know. When I come back, I'll be glad to turn the office upside down for you. Good afternoon, Miss Hammond. What can I do for you? I have a very important telegram for the Sheriff, and I was told I'd find him here. Well, he's busy in the other room with some miners, but if it's very important... Well, it's from the President of Monarch Smelters. Oh. Well, one moment, please. I'll tell him you're here. -Janet Hammond's outside. -What's she doing here? She brought a telegram for the Sheriff from Comstock. He must have wired the main office about Wallace. I'll send her in. You take care of her. All right. Go right in, Miss Hammond. Thanks very much. Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Take it easy, Miss. You better sit down. Be comfortable. Helen, you can take the afternoon off. You've been working pretty hard lately. Thank you, Mr. Chapin. Don't you think this little comedy has gone far enough? This is an outrage, an officer of the law aiding and abetting a murderer. The law says a man is innocent until proven guilty. Now, that goes as much for you as it does for Wallace here. I'll vouch for his appearance whenever he's wanted. What's the meaning of this, Mr. Chapin? -You can't hold me here. -Shut up. Lock her in the other room. Get in there! -Did you read the wire? -Yeah. Duplicate identification papers are on the way. When they arrive, we're through. Load the gold. We'll make a getaway while we still have time. Hey, Sheriff, how come this man's running around with you armed? He's accused of a killing. Maybe so, Corey, but I have reason to believe that he was framed and that he's really Neal Wallace, Vice-President of Monarch Smelters. Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? I didn't have time. I was only two jumps ahead of a lynching mob, and I've got to thank you for those two jumps, too. Well, every man's entitled to a fair break. If Wallace didn't kill Hammond, who do you think did? Well, I'm not saying yet. We'll close in on the real murderers, though, as soon as I get a telegram I'm expecting. Oh, that is good news. If we can help, just let us know. May be calling on you, Corey. Hey, fellas! Up here! [laughs] What are you up to? I'm gonna make a fl-flying mount. [laughing] Well, here I go! Ready or not... -[laughing] -Aah! [grumbles] Doggone! Ain't that a dirty trick? I'd have made it if he hadn't moved. [hooves clopping] Well, I'll bet you were glad to get that telegram, Neal. What telegram? What are you talking about, Mary? Why, didn't Janet find you? I haven't seen her. But she rode in town almost an hour ago with a wire from Comstock. Oh, she was here, all right, and I sent her out to the smelter after you two. But she didn't say nothing about no telegram. So that was who Chapin's lady visitor was. Mary, go find Corey and the boys. Tell 'em to meet us at the smelter. There's gonna be trouble. Hey! Wait for me! Get out of the way, Mary! I'm coming! Ohh! Oh, here I am, mixed up in-- I never had any trouble getting on a horse, just always falling off. Yah! On, MacTaggert! Look at this! Hurry up, Norton. You haven't got much time. [orchestra playing] [hooves clopping] The Sheriff must have found out about his sister. We can hold 'em off 'til the boys get a good start and then duck out the back way. [gunfire] [gunfire] It won't be very easy to blast 'em out of there. I'm going around behind the smelter. You keep firing from here to hold their attention. Right. Cover the back, Larkin. Send a couple of boys to take care of Brewster. Right. [gunfire] Hey, you fellas take over while we finish loading. [gunfire] [gunfire continues] [gunfire] All right, come on out of there. [gunfire continues outside] [orchestra playing] [muttering] Ohh! [sputters] [blowing] You boys, beat it. Let me out of here! Let me out of here! [pounding] Somebody, let me out! Are you all right, Janet? Yes. Don't worry about me. Get after Travis and Chapin. You better go that way. [gunshot] [gunfire] Get up! [gunshot] [gunfire] Don't be a-scared of that hombre. He ain't so tough. [orchestra playing] Whoo! Whoo! [cackles] Well, my boy, we got you! Ha ha! [Little Joe] Get in there, you great, big buffalo! Go on in there, doggone you! -[laughing] -Don't you talk back to me. I'll kick your eyeteeth out so you can't see.
