People say that life is full of surprises. Sometimes we're at the top, sometimes at the bottom. But not for me. Every day is the same for me. Without any surprises. We'll start from here. When I lost everything that I loved. Cancer took everything I had. My wife, Tami. And our money. Hey, don't throw that away! So, you still want to tailor clothes? The sewing machine's gone. I'll probably look for tailor shops. Maybe there's a vacancy. Well, I'll be going now. I'll pray that you'll get a job soon. Thank you, Ma'am. Dad. Will Mom be confused because we moved houses? Your mom is smart. She'll know where you are. Tampan, Tami, and Topan. This tailor shop used to be our dreams before everything disappeared. A suit isn't just clothing. A suit is an heirloom holding the glorious history of its owner. The right choice of fabric, accurate cuts, neat sewing, would be meaningless without love and pride from the tailor. A suit doesn't just reflect the owner's characteristics. But it's deeper than that. Who was the maker? Mr. Tomo. Hey, Topan. I'm busy. No one's interested yet. Maybe it wants to go home. Son. Topan. You have skills. The skills for tailoring. It's a waste if you don't use it. I'll definitely tailor clothes, sir. - Excuse me. Bintang is being naughty. - Yeah. - Oh, my. - Come in and look around. All right. This isn't ours anymore. Come on, I feel bad for Mr. Tomo. Wait a second. Wait a second! Bye, Mr. Tomo! I only made one promise to Tami. Even if everything disappears, Bintang's future won't ever disappear. Where will we sleep tonight, Dad? Wait here for a bit, okay? Don't go anywhere. - Where are you going? - Hold on. VACANCIES - Could I borrow a pen, sir? - Sure. Here. Thank you, sir. Hey. Who is this? Whose kid is this? Where are his parents? I'm Topan's son. I don't know who your parents are. Bintang! I told you not to go anywhere! - Is this your kid? - Sorry, miss. Yes, he's my kid. - Bintang. - Topan? - How do you know my name? - Your kid told me. - Are you going to leave your kid here? - No. Don't use "thank you." We use money. - There's... - Excuse me! - Topan? - Hey! Sorry I'm late, Topan. - It's okay! - I'm busy! - It's fine! - Where's Bintang? He's over there. - Say hello. - You're so big now. Say hello! - How old are you now? - Six. Six years old? Prita. This is my cousin. He's good-looking, right? My family's good-looking. It's just me that's... You get angry easily. You never change. - Come to my place. Bintang, come on. - Come on. - How are you? - I'm well. Miss, the fish! Hey! Don't! Don't pick them up like that! Darman. Are you crazy? It's a small house! We even bump into people in this alley. They just need a place to stay for a bit. Are Topan and Bintang just going to sleep here? How about their meals? - I'll take care of it. - You? - Yeah. - As if. Look at my hands. I'm always holding a kid. - You wanted them. - Says who? I'm getting a headache taking care of four kids who act just like you. All right. It'll be fine. Kids, let's go play outside. Go on, play. Go, play outside. You and Bintang can sleep in the front. Or Bintang can sleep with my kids? - That could work. What? - Anywhere is fine. It's comfortable here. Just sleep in the front room. The bedrooms are already full. It's cooler in here. It's fine. We'll be fine here. Hey, is the food ready? I don't know if there's enough rice. Just buy rice at the store. More debt? We haven't paid off the last debt. It's okay. I'll pay it off. You don't need to talk about it now. It's fine. - Hold him. - Come here. Why do you keep crying? Sorry, Topan. I don't want to be rude with guests. And you're his cousin. But you can see how the house is. All Darman does is talk. I'm the one who knows... - Here. - What is this, Topan? To help you out. It's not much. - You don't have to! - It's fine. Thank you for understanding. Just let it be, Darman. He knows what needs to be done. Oh, my. Honey, let's go inside. Invite him in. I'll make coffee. Relax. She became friendly. Women are like that. We're like ATM machines to them! Are there no vacancies for you, Topan? All tailors know how hard it is. - What? - There are no vacancies yet. We were asked to wait. I don't know until when. It's understandable. I'm not the only one who's unemployed. A lot of competition. So, what is your plan? Could I join you for a bit? What? Be a scalper? Yeah. - Dad. - Yes? What's a scalper, Dad? A scalper is... An adventurer! That's amazing, Dad! Mosquito! Did you get it? - I'll tickle you! - Dad! Have mercy! When the teacher is explaining, don't daydream. Okay? Pay attention. Don't talk too much with Farell. Miss Nita will scold you again. Okay, Mr. Amazing Scalper! Not so loud. A scalper is a secret adventurer. Okay, Mr. Amazing Scalper. Come on, Bintang! Come on, Bintang! - Mr. Topan. - Miss Nita. Sorry in advance. I need to give this to you. It's from the principal. It's the third reminder. Help me out, miss. I'm still trying to get the money to pay for Bintang's tuition fees. I understand, sir. I'm also trying to help. But it's best that you look for another school. A lot of cheaper schools. There are even free ones. But Bintang's mom really wants him in here. - But your wife... - It's a promise, miss. Sorry. I'll be going. - Right. - Thank you. Come on. Let's go. Topan. Thank God, we got a lot. These are tickets for this hour. Let's eat quickly. - Right now! - Thank you, ma'am. Come on. These are for this hour. Be calm. Don't scare them away while selling. BEWARE OF TICKET SCALPERS Ma'am, please tell Yati I'm going out. - I'm leaving the store to her. - Yes. TAN MALAKA 09 MORNING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - There you go. - Thank you. - Topan. - It's hard, isn't it? What's hard about it? It's easy if you're used to it. This is for you. It's a lot. We are cousins. It's okay. - For Bintang. - Thank you, Darman. I need to pick up Bintang right now. - Right now? - Yes. - He'll be mad if I'm late. - Okay. - I'm going. - Right! Where is he? What's that, Dad? Look left and right. Is it safe? It's for me! Okay. Awesome! Let's go. Dad. Miss Nita scolded me. Why? What did you do? Hey, what did she say to you? No. I just farted in class. Miss Nita said that was rude. That is rude! Batman is flying! Right. Thank you, sir! Ticket, sir? "Sir." I'll slap you. It's "Miss." From Surabaya to Solo. It's cheap. - It's only an extra 20,000. - How about 10,000? Well? This is pretty good! We still have some left. Take it all. - Okay? - Did I sell all this? You're already good at it. Just do what you did. You should relax. Here, cover it with this. PLATFORM 1 Hey! Hold it! Hey, hold it! - Hey! - Oh, no. Hey! Hey! Use that. So they won't recognize you. I thought you got caught! Thankfully you weren't. - I almost was, Darman. - You were? If you're thinking about the money, we could figure it out. We'll just try. Hey, Bintang! Why aren't you playing? Be quiet! I'll smack you if you don't! - Odi, be quiet! - Hey! I'll smack you! Why would you smack our child? Your kid's being a wimp. Crying just because he got hit? Boys usually fight. Your injuries aren't that bad. My dad didn't even care when I was bleeding. - He's your kid! - Here. Look what happened to him! Did you hit Odi? Hey. Is it true that you hit Odi? Why did you hit people? Don't fight with people! - Topan. - You want to be a hotshot? - Gangster? Don't cry! - Topan. - Calm down. - Your fault! Cut it out, Topan. Apologize. Hurry up and apologize. Come here. - Odi, I'm sorry. - Yeah. Done. Go back and play. You already apologized and made up. Must be so easy. Just apologize, and it's fixed. I hate this when people stay at our house. So complicated! Inside, Odi. You're the one who's complicated! - Look what you did. - Why? - This is normal! - You're causing trouble. - Why me? - You're also in the wrong. I just got home, Atun, and you're scolding me like this. It's okay, Odi. You have to be strong. When you grow up, you'll see that the world is much crueler! Bintang! Bintang! Bintang! Mr. Tomo. Bintang. Let's go home. Come on. Let's go home! Dad. I... Forgive me, Dad. Why rent a room? That's a waste of money. Just stay at my place. - I already paid for it. - You did? - I already paid for it. - Oh, no. It's better this way. It's closer to the school. - Atun likes to go overboard. - Atun? It's not Atun's fault. It's time for me to find my own place. She went overboard. - Sometimes she's... - Good evening. I have an offer for you. Quick ways to get rich. Come invest with us. I got this yesterday. - I don't need it. - Just take it and contact me. - Okay. - Thank you. How many rupiah is $20 million? I don't know. It's hard to get 20 million. - Much less dollars. - I'm keeping this. Who knows? I might get lucky. - Ma'am. - Yes, miss? One coffee. Send it to my place. - Okay. - Excuse me, miss. I want to return this hat. Thank you. Just hold onto it. It's not mine. It was left behind. Hey, Prita. You're so angry, Prita. That's why you should get married. It's great, you know? You devil. Feisty. Hey. What's with you? Why are you smiling? No. She's a nice person. She is? She gave me this hat. Topan. Don't. The guys trying to court her end up frustrated. One even died. He jumped from a train. Seriously. If you want to find a good mother for Bintang, don't choose her. I get it, Topan. You've been by yourself for a long time. Mr. Topan. I need to talk to you. Just the two of us. Wait here. - Just for a little bit. - Okay. Bintang, starting from tomorrow, your school will be on a break. - A school break, Dad? - Yes. Okay? Accompany me. To be a scalper? I'm going to be a scalper! It's a secret. - Send my regards to Atun. - I will. Tell her I said thank you. Say goodbye to Darman. - Be good, okay? Don't cause trouble. - Yes. - Okay, Darman. - Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. No need to say thanks! We're cousins! You're always saying thanks! Tonight, we'll have a picnic here. Like we did before, Dad? - When we went to Puncak with Mom? - Yeah. We'll sleep in the carriage like we did before. Do you remember? Try this one, Dad. Here. Now it's time for Batman to fly. One, two, three! - You good? - Yeah. I want to see Mom. Bintang. You're the one who told me that Mom is smart. She knows wherever we are. All right. Let's close our eyes now. We'll think about Mom together. Okay? - Okay. - Close your eyes. Mom... Bintang, wake up! Come here. Careful! I'm going to jump. - And then you jump, okay? - Okay! Come on, jump! Jump! Come on! Come on! Jump! Platform 1, attention. The train is arriving from the south. The train is arriving on Platform 1. BEWARE OF TICKET SCALPERS What is it, Dad? It's nothing. It's fine. Now we have to take a bath! - Brush our teeth! - Let's go! A secret adventure! - We have to take a bath! - Be clean! My heart is happy anywhere What's this? Look! A toothbrush came out! This is even worse. Toothpaste came out! Bintang. Wait here for a bit, okay? Don't go anywhere. Keep studying even on a break. Where's your pencil? Take it out. - It's not here, Dad. - It's there. You put it there yourself. - I didn't. - Work on this one, okay? Here. While I'm gone, work on numbers one through five. Okay? Did you hear me? - Did you? - I did. Don't go past this yellow line. Trains. The boundaries are from this bench to that bench. You can't go past the line. Okay? Topan. How much did you get? 752,000. You got around 700,000? That's great. Miss. Will you watch my stuff? I need to go to the toilet. Don't take too long. The train is coming soon. Okay, Miss. Thank you! Here, there are two more. Sell them. - Where are you going? - I'm going to get coffee. - I'll be back. - Semarang. Topan. This is for you. - Thanks. - Right. - I'll be back. - Okay, Darman. Yeah. Semarang to Solo. To Semarang, ma'am? Business and economy tickets. Tickets. - Business and economy. - Mister. Two tickets to Semarang? - What class, ma'am? - Business. - How many tickets? - Two. Each costs 200,000. You want them? - Isn't that too expensive? - That's how it is. I'm not making any profit. Well? Hey, that's mine! Hey! Give it back, that's mine! Sorry, ma'am. You need to give me 50,000 more. Then let me add this. - What? - Sir! Sir! Give it back! That's mine! Hey! Give it back! Sir! My son is there, sir! Don't do this! I need to go there! - Don't! - Keep still. My son is waiting for me there! It's mine! Stop. Where's your son? - That bench over there. - Where? Help me, ma'am. You need to look, ma'am! Hey, keep walking! - Give it back! - No! Bintang! Bintang! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Sir, please help me. My son is alone at the station. Help me, sir. My son is alone at the station! He's a child! Uncle Darman! Uncle Darman! Uncle Darman... How long will you be here? What is that? Why do you keep holding onto it? Even to the point that you were almost hit by a train. It's a plank sign. It's my dad's. My mom wrote it. Your dad is a tailor? Yes, he was when my mom was still alive. But now he's a secret adventurer. What's a secret adventurer? A scalper. Do you know what that is? Scalpers are secret adventurers. Come with me. I'm waiting for Dad. Your dad won't come home tonight. Come on. He'll have trouble finding me. Your dad is smart. He'll know where to find you. So? You want to wait? Well... I'm going home. For your information, no one is brave enough to wait alone here. It's scary. Wait! Just put your stuff there. Are you tired? Just sit down. Hey. Do you remember the fish that you saved? I named it Bintang. What's your name? Prita. So, the small one is Bintang. The big one... is Topan. The white one is Prita. Prita. Thank you. Bintang! Bintang! Where's Bintang? You're so rude! It's not your house. I'm sorry, miss. But is my son here? He's not here. He's taking a bath. Hey! You're terrible. Do you know why I'm looking after kids here? Because I love kids? No! They're not even mine. So troublesome. But I know it's dangerous to leave a kid at the station! Kids were being murdered, kidnapped, mutilated... Miss! Listen to me, miss! I never intended to leave him! I was caught yesterday! Can you ever get caught? You're terrible. You lied to your kid. You let him think his dad is amazing. - But you're just a fraud. - Dad! Hey. Are you all right? Where were you last night? I was working. On an adventure again? Yes. Are you sure? - I'm fine. - Here's your stuff. Get the rest. Come on, put it on. Did you use the towel? Why is your hair still so wet? Even your ears are still so wet. Ears need to be dry and clean. So, you can hear when someone's talking. You're still so wet. See? You're still so wet! Come on. Wait! Here, take it. No. Bintang would be sad. Just let him live with Topan and Prita in the aquarium. Okay, up to you. I want to take care of Prita's fishes! We'll get bigger fishes. Better ones. Where are we going now, Dad? A place with many tall buildings! Be careful! Hey! Hey. Play over there. Not here. Okay? Hey! I already told you. Why won't you listen? You'll get hit by something. You'll get hit by a rock. Hurry. - Go over there. - Man. Don't be harsh. This is my son! He shouldn't be playing here. He might get hit! - Rocks may fall on his head. - Relax, he's just a kid. - What's going on here? - His kid is playing here, sir. Hey, Topan. Whether it be your kid, my kid or even the president's kid, kids aren't allowed to be here! It's the rules! What kind of parent are you? Get him out of here. Yes, sir. Come on. Listen to me. Don't go there anymore. This is your headquarters. Here. These are your boundaries. You can't go past them. Okay? Don't follow anyone. You follow people around, that's all you do. What if you get hit by something? TOTAL DEBT Bintang. Do you want to look at the stars? I do. It'll be fun. Let's go. Where are the stars, Dad? There aren't any. You're right. There aren't any. It's empty. The sky is empty. No stars. That's why me and your mom insisted on naming you "Bintang." Why, Dad? Because of this. Look. Even if the sky is empty with no stars, me and your mom have one star at home. Right here. Me and your mom's star. A star that's naughty, noisy, and won't listen to his dad. Right? Look, Dad! So cool! Are those also stars? Those are the stars of Jakartans! But me and your mom have an even better star! Right here, me and your mom's star! Look! - Did you lock it? - I did. - Here. - Thanks. Yeah. Prita? Bintang. What are you doing here? Wanted to see the fish. Who are you with? Only kids whose parents left them here are allowed to look at the fish. For how long? What do you mean? How long will you leave him here? It's 20,000 for three hours. 30,000 for six hours. I'm not leaving him here. - Then, what? - He just wants to look at the fish. Yeah. Only kids who are dropped off here are allowed. Okay. Thanks. Never mind. Bintang, let's go. Thank you. Bintang! - I'm going to work. - Okay. Hey. You used to be a scalper. What are you now? - None of your business. - I need to know. If he suddenly needs to stay over because his dad got arrested, - what should I do? - Won't happen. Please take good care of my kid. 30,000 is a lot of money. - Excuse me. - Hey. - What now? - Your number. Kids are given numbers? Like the lottery. Here! You don't go to school? Dad says it's holidays. Topan! Tama! Bintang, get over there! Come on, Bintang! Bintang. You're back already? - Come on, Prita. - You still need to pay me 5,000 more. What? You said six hours was 30,000. But it's 15 minutes past. It's counted as seven hours. This is extortion. It's not. It's the rules. Bintang. Come on. - I'll see you tomorrow, Prita. - Yeah. Hey. Who said you're coming here tomorrow? Where will you leave him tomorrow? Just leave him here. - Come on. - Hey, wait. You can sew, right? Why? What do you need sewn? Your mouth. Here. This is someone I know. His name's Mr. Kris. Just meet him. Tell him that you know me. I was starting to wonder. Soft hands like that won't last as a coolie. How long will you lie that it's a school break? Bintang. Let's go. - Thank you, miss. - It's not for you. It's for your son. Topan. Yes, sir. How is it, Mr. Kris? You can work now. Okay? Yes! This is Mr. Supri. He's the one in charge of the production here. Yes, sir. - I'm Topan. - Right. Oh, one more thing. Mr. Supri, is that room still empty? It is, sir. Then let Topan take that room. You'll be there. Okay? Thank you so much, sir. - Thank you so much. - Yes. - Welcome. - Thank you so much, sir. Go ahead. Mr. Topan? Yes, sir? When can we start? As soon as possible. I could start tomorrow. - Tomorrow, then? - Yes. Which shift do you want? Morning? Noon? Or night? Can I take two shifts, sir? Are you strong enough? I believe that I am. What are you to Miss Prita? What do you mean? Okay, Topan. This is your first task. One suit. The measurements are written here. Be careful with measuring and cutting. Don't get anything wrong. Don't make it ugly, rough, and below standards. Bintang. Hide. - Topan. I'm going home. - Yes, sir. Hi. - It's so neat. - Oh, my. - Help teach the others, okay? - Okay. Good evening, Prita. Bintang, you surprised me. Why are you here so late? Are you busy tonight, Prita? I'm going to take a break. What is it? Have you had dinner tonight? What if I haven't? Are you asking me out? With who? With me and my dad. Just a moment. Hey. Just wait here. Dad! Sir. The bill, please. The total is exactly 150,000. Hey, no need to. Don't show off. You haven't even got paid. Still, I should be paying. When you get paid, we can take turns paying. - Thank you. - Thanks. Is Mr. Kris your friend or relative? He's my husband. You're married? Why? No. It's nothing. I'm not wife material? No. You definitely are. Idiot. He believed me! Topan. Sir. Could I borrow a pen? A pen. SHOULDERS: 42 SHOULDERS: 42 - ARMS: 59 BACK: 32 - WAIST: 70 BUST: 34 BUST: 31 BUST: 34 Actually, I wanted to say thank you for introducing me to Mr. Kris. No need to thank me. Just work hard. Don't embarrass me in front of Mr. Kris. You asked me who Mr. Kris is. Mr. Kris is a relative of my mom. We're both newcomers. But he's successful and I'm not. He also helped me open up the store. I wouldn't have been able to open it myself. A store that big. You don't say. Where are your parents? My mom passed away. My dad... left us a long time ago. I don't know where he went. He makes no sense. Two years after my dad left us my mom passed away. She was really hurt by him. No wonder. You were furious when I left Bintang at the station. Of course. Bintang. Thanks for inviting me to dinner. You're welcome. Thank you, Prita. Wait! Oh, my gosh. Are you happy that you came with us, Prita? Are you happy that you came with us, Miss Prita? Well... I guess so. I mean, are you happy or not? Oh, my gosh. I'm happy! It's a success! Topan, how do you sew the canvas so well? Mine is so bad. You did it correctly. Compare it to mine. This is my sewing. Yours aren't close enough, sir. It could be easy or difficult to sew. But canvassed is one of the things that determines the quality of a suit. Topan. Let me see the pants. You go get... interfacing, croton, and viselin fabric. In J Block. Just say "Supri. Silver thread." Here are the notes. Should I get the canvas too? - The canvas. - No need. Just use viselin. Double it. Okay? - I'll go now. - All right. - Tidy it up. - Yes, sir. Mr. Supri. Here it is. The cufner is in storage. Here is the viselin. And this is the croton. Okay. Sorry, sir. You sure we don't need more canvas? The stock in the storage ran out. I'm sure. What's the problem? It's nothing. But for the inner layer, what shall we use? We'll use the viselin. We double it. Oh, my. If we use viselin, the quality will differ, Mr. Supri. Oh, well. It's the same, right? It's only for the inner layer too. No one knows the difference. We can't see it. But when we wear it... It'll feel different. You're paid for that. Sew it right. Don't make it different. Work on it. Happy birthday, Bintang. My son is already grown. Let's blow out the candle together. One, two, three! May God always look after you. I love you so much, Bintang. I love you too, Dad. Now I have something for you. Hold onto this, okay? We'll eat it together. Okay. This is for you, Bintang. Wrong one. Not this one. That's for Prita, isn't it? You're loud. Here. I can go to school again! I can go to school again! Our latest suits were rejected by the importers. Oh, my gosh. Check it. Oh, my gosh. Oh, no. I don't know, sir. Maybe someone purposely sabotaged our work. You should be monitoring that! I did, sir! But for the last purchase of fabrics, I didn't retrieve it. Who was it? Topan? Mr. Supri! What are you doing here so early? You don't need to come to work anymore. Mr. Manager isn't satisfied with the results of your sewing. It's bad! It's rough! It's below standard! That's impossible, sir. - Are you serious? - I am! And this is your pay. So, pack up your things for the next tailor to come in. Okay? He quit this morning, sir. - Give me another chance. - When I asked him, he said that he got a job offer somewhere else. Outside the city. In Surabaya, he said. I forgot. Where was it? That jerk. We were duped. Isn't it nice, Dad? Supri, take care of this right now. - Do it! - Yes, sir! Oh, my gosh. - Come on, Dad! - Be patient, son. I don't want to! - I want to go to school! - Yes, Bintang. Be patient. - Miss Prita! - Hey! Bintang! I want to see the fish! Bintang! You jerk. I helped you, and you're not thankful. - Let me explain. - You jerk! Let me explain, Prita! You misunderstand! You embarrassed me, you know? Don't come here anymore. I don't care if you want to be a scalper or a robber. You have to pay for Kris' losses. No matter what. Leave. Bintang. I want to be with Prita. Didn't you hear? Let's go. I don't want to! Bintang! Dad! Wait, Dad! Why do you carry that around? Just throw it away! Throw it away! What are you doing? Throw it away. Give it to me. Let go! Don't touch it again. Walk quickly. Come on. Why are you not listening? Why would you take it again? Let go! You want to take it again? Let's go. Hurry up. FOR CONTRACT CALL 085290921 Dad. Where are we going? I love you, Dad. Mom said that I have to be proud of you. Don't give up, Dad. You have to keep going. Forgive me. Atun. Is Darman at home? He's not here. He's working. - Is he doing scalper work? - No. He quit. He said he's tired of it. He's doing a shooting near the station. "Shooting"? Okay, Asuf, don't... - Darman! - Topan! Hey! How did you know I was here? Atun told me. - Hey! - You're shooting a movie? Topan. My name's not Darman here. It's Rendi. - Rendi the fighter. - Yeah. Everyone knows me by Rendi. - You're an actor now? - No. I'm a stuntman, Topan. What's that? A stuntman is... I do the dangerous scenes. - You're amazing. - Not really. - Let's go. - Right. Just stay here. I'll be back. - Stay with my friend. - Yeah. - Be careful. - Yeah. Let's get ready. Is everyone ready? Camera, roll... - How was it, sir? - A mess. The fire wasn't real enough. It's no good. What's wrong with you? We'll do it again. - My leg. - Twisted? I think so. Don't touch it. It hurts. Atun will be mad. I promised to buy her martabak, Topan. Rendi. How are you? Can't you do it? Really... I really can't. I want to finish it tonight. Sorry. I need to find your replacement. Sir. I'll do it. - Are you a stuntman too? - He's my cousin. - Yes, sir. - Your cousin? - Yes. - Okay, we got a new stuntman. Everyone get ready. Topan, it's dangerous. Don't do it. It should be fine. You're crazy. Don't do it. Topan. Okay. Are you okay? I want him to keep this stuntman. - Let him be in the scenes. - Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Topan, look what you've done. Wait. Take it later. Uncle Topan bought it. Say thank you first. Thank you, Uncle Topan. - Just eat it. - Thank you, Topan. Does it feel nice, Dad? It's the nicest in all of Indonesia. What's Prita doing right now? Why are you thinking about Miss Prita? As if she's thinking about us. I miss her fish. I'll buy you better and bigger ones. What? What's this? Money for your trouble. It's not much compared to your loss. You think that I asked to meet you to collect this money? I feel bad, Mr. Kris. I was the one who asked Topan to work here, after all. Prita. I actually wanted to thank you. Yeah. The one who messed up was my production manager. It was Supri, not Topan. What do you mean? Well... Supri was involved in corruption. But I fired him. Topan was the scapegoat. Supri was jealous of him. They said this suit's too big. It can't be used. - Can't we do something? - What can we do? No one can sew here. Sorry, sir. If I may know, how oversized is it? It's quite a bit. Two fingers wide. My cousin is good at it. If it's just sewing, it's easy for him. - Okay. - Do you have thread? - What do you need, Topan? - What else? I need five minutes, sir. Did you know that during the time Topan worked for me here, our suits were praised by the Hong Kong importers? When I asked the other employees, they told me that it was actually Topan who taught them how to make a good suit. So, I asked to meet you here because I want Topan to come back and work for me again. Topan. - You got something good. - What is it? Fabric for a suit. The artist whose suit you fixed... He wants you to make one. Here's the fabric. How do I do that? I don't even have a sewing machine. Get your sewing machine back. - Return it. - What? Why should I? I need to pay for Bintang's tuition. Exactly. You'll get quite a lot for Bintang's school needs. Come on. He's a dumb artist. He gave you the fabric. You just have to sew it. You're good at this. - Where are we going, Dad? - Somewhere. You'll see. Are we getting the sewing machine? - Mr. Tomo! - Tomo! That's enough. Wow. Bintang and Topan. What brings you here so late? We're here to take the sewing machine, sir. Yes, Mr. Tomo. We're going to take back the sewing machine. Oh, no. Someone just took it this evening. Yeah. I tried to hold onto it. But that person insisted. I had no choice but to let go of it. Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Bintang. I was too late. I couldn't get your mom's sewing machine back Forgive me. It's fine. We'll buy a new one, Dad. But it's different from your mom's. What matters is that you can sew again! It'll be awesome! Like this. I'm going. I need an adventure. I'm so proud to have a son like you. So proud. Whatever happens, you are the best child in the world. The best child in the world. Wait. - What is it, Topan? - Hold up. Topan. What are you doing? Why would you take that thing? Throw it away! Make a new one! That one's bad. It's not about the sign. But its history. I have to cherish it. - Bintang taught me that. - "History." You call that history? The National Monument is! Lubang Buaya is! Munir! Munir is history! But you call that history. You're so weird. Topan. Are you going to jump from there? It's not that high. I'm sorry I disappointed you. Bintang misses you. Darman's house. Topan. Relax. Shake your head. Look at me. - Relaxed yet? - No. Do it again. - Hey. - Yes, sir? - Go on standby. - Okay. - I'll get him ready. - I'll wait. Okay. We'll be there soon. - Darman. - What? - Promise me. - Oh, my gosh. If anything happens to me, you have to take care of Bintang. What are you saying? It's safe! - I saw it. - He has to become great. - Oh, my gosh. - Don't let him be like me. Why are you so serious? Don't think like that. Bintang is proud of you! Here. Put this on. Promise me, Darman. I promise, Topan. Are you relaxed now? Here. People say that life is full of surprises. Sometimes we're at the top. Sometimes we're at the bottom. But not for me. Every day is the same for me. Without any surprises. Help him! Topan. Are you okay? Topan? Wake up, Topan. - Help! - Help! Get over here! Topan. - You're amazing in that scene. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. After this, I want to make a film in South Africa. Come with me, okay? - Go with him! - Let him come. - It's good pay. - It's not that. - This isn't my specialty. - I want you. Okay? Think about it. Hey. You're coming, right? I can't. Let Rendi go. - Yes, I'll come. I want to. - What do you mean? I can't go to Africa. I have a kid. - It's far. - I'm not talking about Africa. I meant the suit. - You said you were working on it. - Right. It's done. Here, the fabric... - Honey. - Hello! Daddy's home! Say hi to Dad. Daddy's home. - Why is he crying? - I don't know. He's been like this. Where's Bintang? Right, Topan. Your friend came here and she brought Bintang with her. Her name is Miss Prita. Topan. I came to pick up Bintang. Yeah. This is for my debt to Mr. Kris. It's not all of it yet. - I'll pay it off as soon as I can. - You don't need to. No. This is my responsibility. No. You don't need to. I want to apologize. I shouldn't have gotten angry at you like that. I should have asked you first. I'm sorry, Topan. I should be the one apologizing. I've troubled you even though you've helped me a lot. That. Why did you hang up the sign? I bet Bintang did it. He's... I told him. But he can't let go of it. It wasn't him. I hung it up. What? What do you mean? - Dad! Look! - Yeah. I don't know how to thank you. You made Bintang's dreams come true something I could never do for him. You've brought back a missing part of my life. Thank you. Thank you for everything. Thank you. Yes. Dad, start sewing again! What are you doing? Do it like this. - Hey. - Don't show off. You paid for the sewing machine, now you want to pay for meals. Don't be arrogant. - So, there you are. I found you. - Mr. Kris. Mr. Kris, I apologize for that incident. It's fine. Relax. I didn't come here for that. - Wait here for a bit. - Okay. Hey. Why is Mr. Kris here? - Is this the guy? - Right. Here he is. Yes. I'm Abu Rizal. And who is this? - Bintang. - I'm Prita, sir. So, listen. The manager told me a lot about you. - Yeah. - You're an expert at making suits. I'm a beginner, sir. To be frank, I'm interested. We could work together. This is my card. "Silver Row"? You own Silver Row? Sir! Nice to meet you! Right. So, we could work together? Work together on what? Making your dreams come true. - Yes! Thank you! - Yes. - I pray for your success. - Thank you, sir. Where are we sleeping tonight, Dad? Starting from tonight you can sleep anywhere you want. - Really, Dad? - Really! And starting tomorrow little Batman is going back to school! Yeah! Batman is flying! Is this new, Topan? You need to sign, but I don't get it. - New contract? - Yes. It says "dollars"! 20,000 dollars! - How much is that in rupiah? - 200 million! What? Oh, my gosh! And that's life. It's not about being at the top or at the bottom. But it's how we go through it. With faith and love.
