You always just know how to make me laugh. [ Beeps ] [ Woman #3 ] You're so thoughtful, Dray. I mean, Buster never asks me how my day was, or how I feel, or-- [ Beeps ] [ Woman #4 ] Ooh, why do I love you? Mmm, Dray. Where should I begin? [ Doorbell Rings ] I'll be right there! [ Rewinding ] [ Chuckles ] Lisa. Hey. Come here. Mwah. Good morning. Ooh, Dray, this is nasty. Hey. How's my baby doing? I'm fine. [ Chuckles ] Mmm. Mmm. All right. Slow down, cowboy.

Not this morning. Don't put that dirty sock on me. [ Chuckles ] Mandingo. Fearless warrior. There's no task too great for him. Mm-hmm. Yes. No task? Well, good. Then take your Mandingo butt out of here... so I can clean, okay? Now, that's your task. Mandingo. Okay. All right. All right. Whoo! Bingo. [ Chuckles ] Oh, Dray-Dray. Yeah. You've got seven messages on your machine, baby. Yeah? So? So, how come you haven't checked them yet? Because it's probably messages from my crew. You know, Spootie and Kilo been bugging me all day... about goin' to my mom's barbecue. Okay. Well, they ain't about nothin', so I'm sure you won't mind if I check them, right? Real quick-- Do I ever come over to your place though-- Do-- Do I? Do I come over your place and go through your stuff, knock your Mary Kay all over, what? No, Dray, because you know I have nothing to hide. Don't go there. We are talking about your machine. [ Sighs ] Okay. I'll play it for you. I'll play it for you, okay? I will play it for you. Okay, wait. What? You don't have to play it, okay? You sure? 'Cause, baby, listen. No. I will play this thing for you. I will play the remix. No, Dray, we're gonna leave it there. Because you know what? I trust you. I'll play this for you. You don't have to play it, Dray, okay? I'm sorry. Tsk. Come here. [ Sighs ] I love you. I love you more. [ Both Chuckling ] I'm going downstairs right now. Okay. Get the mail, and I'll be right back. Okay. You do that. You go downstairs. Okay? All right. You go downstairs. [ Elevator Bell Dings ] Hey, Tony! I still see you're readin' that Fish & Rod, huh? No, this is just a front. I'm "fronting," as you people say. Here. Take a look at that. Ooh. Damn! Boy, oh, boy. Look at that. See, most guys don't have that much hair on their heads. Damn! Boy, she must trim that with a weed whacker. And look. See? You can see her whole, um-- um-- uh-- Don't-- Oh, don't tell me. Don't tell me. Uh, vagina. Yes. Damn, it's been a long time. I've got to know. And all I've got to do is push that button. I'm pushing that button. Hi, Dray, it's Mama. How are you and sweet little Lisa doin'? Oh, my God! His mother! Give your mama a call,okay? [ Beeps ] Dray, this is Grandmama. [ Gasps ] His grandmother! Oh, no! Anybody but his grandmother! [ Beeps ] [ Man ] Yo, Dray. This is Spootie. - You ever thought about-- - Spootie, Booty-- whatever your name is. Hey, wait a second. What, are you out of your mind? You know she's probably up there in your room, searching through your dresser, lookin' through your clothes. Well, at least she's listening to the answering machine. See, even themost trustworthy girl... will check that answering machine. So just change the tape. - Ahhh! - Ahhh. Yeah. Meanwhile, I like that one you came back with last night. [ Chuckles ] Who, Sherri? Oh, boy, I'd like to start sloppin' and boppin'... on that great big juicy ass. Just diggin' my fingernails into it. Just squeezing the life out of it. Just-- I don't know how you find them. Oh, man. Whew. [ Sighs ] Do I smell breakfast? You sure do. Come on down here and sit and eat. Oh, boy. All nice and hot. My favorite-- pancakes and eggs. Mmm! Oh, come on, Dray. What did I tell you? Sit down here and eat before it gets cold, okay? [ Exhales ] [ Phone Ringing ] I'll get it. [ Ringing Continues ] All right. I trust you. [ Rings ] Hello? [ Woman ] Hi, baby. Just can't stop thinking about you. Mmm. Did you get my message? Sure I did. You were really wonderful. You know I'm ready for some more. When can I see you? Sooner than you think. I love you. [ Exhales ] I love you too, baby. Who was on the phone? Oh, Sherri, this big-booty girl I was bonin' last night. - Doo, doo, doo, doo. - Yeah, Dray. You play too much. [ Doorbell Rings ] Hi, Lisa. Hi, Jenny. - What's up, Jenny? - Hey, Dray! Oh, Lisa! You made pancakes, girl? Mm-hmm. D, Mommy said she need her big black pot for the barbecue today. You need to learn how to return things. Girl, I don't know why you're sweatin' over that stove over D. [ Laughs ] He ain't nothin' but a roach-ass ghetto pimp. - Where the pancakes at? - The butter is over there. - They're in the oven, girl. - Thank you, Lisa. Okay. Come and give me a kiss before I have to go to work. [ Chuckles ] Oh, yeah. You wanna put that over there for me? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Come here, come here, come here. What time are you gettin' off? Ooh, we have inventory tonight, so probably about 11:00. Oh! I know. Tell Mandingo I'll see him later, okay? Tell him yourself. No, Dray. Talk to him. Just talk to him. No! He's gonna page you later. He'll have to page me. Bye. Oh. Homegirl can cook, but she's stupid as hell for cookin' for you. Why are you always up in my business, just tryin' to mess up my program? Mwah. Ugh! Program? You ain't got no program. D, you a pimp. Girl, you don't even know what a pimp is. A pimp is someone who solicits clients for prostitutes... for the interest of money. Yo, I'm just checkin' to get my groove on. Nigga, you ain't all that. You're not! [ Doorbell Rings ] Oh. That's my friend Katrina. I told Tony to let her up. [ Doorbell Rings ] I told you, don't be bringin' none of your "I wish I got a better weave" girlfriends here. I hope this one is at least housebroken. Ooh! Well, hello there. Hi. You must be Dray. Yes. Uh-uh-uh-uh! Ignore him. Come on in, girl. Weave. Damn! [ Chuckles ] So, you have a really nice place. It's just some cheap shit. Katrina, can I interest you in a beverage of your choice? Excuse me. Why are you talkin' proper all of a sudden like some English teacher? She don't want nothin' you got to offer her. I'm fine, thank you. So, Dray, I've heard a lot about you too. Really? - Yeah. I told her everything about you. - What? How you're a pimp and a player... and you got all these hos chasing your ass. Don't listen to my sister. It's all lies. [ Mock Laugh ] Come on, Katrina. Get out of here. Sister's girlfriends are a player's dream. First of all, they know everything about you already, and they wanna know firsthand if it's all true. Ah! Is it true? Is what true? Well, Jenny says you're a pimp. Yup! Pimpin' and whorin' like there's no tomorrow. [ Sighs ] No. I'm just a man that lives in the moment. Moment to moment. I trust my instincts. [ Phone Rings ] - Yeah. - Yeah. Spoolie and Kilo are here. Spootie! I said Spoolie. Uh, no, no-- [ Whispers ] He's charming. Don't talk to him. Girl, he will eat your-- I'll be right there. No, he won't. [ Grunts ] By the way, Katrina, a friend of mine is having this real nice pool party. Mmm? Maxwell. Oh, Maxwell of Malibu? Tsk. She too busy. I was talking to Katrina. Jenny has the address. She's too busy. Oh, well, we do have a lot of work to do. Thanks anyway. Yeah. Do think about it. [ Kisses ] Oh! Thanks. [ Mouthing Words ] [ Whispers ] Gots to go! She got hella ass, kid! Look at that. Mmm! What's a hella ass? [ Chuckles ] Lot of ass. Lot of booty. Lot of booty. Oh, I see. No. No, Dray! Boop, boop. [ Falsetto ] * Your girl wants to give me some ass * No, she don't! She don't. See, a woman like Katrina will read, write... and erase your ass. No. Your girl is sweatin' me, okay? She's sweatin' you 'cause you need some A.C. up in this motherfucker. [ Dray ] Yo, why all my women gotta be stupid? See, a guy like you can't handle a real woman like me and Katrina. You see, we too smart for all that player shit. Oh, like you was too smart for Michael Jones, who dropped you like a bad habit. Why you have to throw him up in my face like that? Girl, I always throw his name up in your face. Who was the one-- "Stay away from him"? Me! You didn't listen to me, did you? Don't you know that me and Mike is, like-- We live by the same laws. Players. See, we don't take no prisoners. And you ain't no exception. Now you're just a statistic. Oh! So now I'm a statistic? Yeah. And I'm gonna have a ball... makin' your girl Katrina a statistic too. I told you she don't want your ass! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Didn't we already go through this? Listen. Aren't you supposed to get Mommy's pot? If that's really why you came, you can leave. And also, I don't need no statistics all up in my business. Oh, it's on now. Dray, I'm your sister! I remember when you was sucking your thumb, pissin' in a pot! That's why the pot over here now! Ahhh! Jenny, we have a guest. It was a pleasure meeting you. [ Chuckles ] Likewise. [ Dray ] Don't forget about that party. Oh. So now you can't hear nothin' I'm sayin', huh? Well, remember this, Brother. Payback is a bitch. Jenny, enjoy your day. It was a pleasure. [ Sighs ] [ Angry Grunt ] [ Door Closes ] He is such a ho! I can't stand his ass! Do you know what he had the nerve enough to call me? That's what I'm talkin' about. Let's get to work. Now, this, my brother-- this is an onion booty. Oh, I get it! 'Cause booty is an ass, and onion makes you cry. Yeah! So it's onion booty. It makes a grown man cry. Yeah. Yeah! [ Mock Crying ] What, he's crying 'cause he saw an ass? - Nah. He crying 'cause he a virgin. - Oh. [ Laughs ] Yeah, very funny, Thicky Ricardo. Hey, that's enough. Little short-ass fire hydrant, man. Hey, hey. That's it. Why are you here so early anyway? Man, you know how them buses be runnin' slow on holidays. We had to get an early start. And I ain't tryin' to miss your mama cooking, man. Not today anyway. I woke up with it on my mind. Does he ever miss it? Anyway-- Hey, Tony, what can we get for you, man? Oh, let's see. What do they have there? [ Inhales Through Teeth, Exhales Loudly ] Got some candy yams, potato salad. Some chicken. I can't wait! Mmm! Hmm. Could you rub him a little more... 'cause I'm starting to get excited by it. What? This guy's a freak! I'm out of here. We gotta get out of here. Come on, man. No! Come back! Come back. The hell with these women! Bring that fat, bald guy back here! I want to caress his sweaty, black, bald head! Yo, man, Tony turned on that bullshit, man, for real! Man. Whoa! Forget it. Baby! Yes! Come on to papa! Mmm! Dray, Dray! I haven't heard from you in months. Smell the sweat. I bet you could use a good workout. And you know I love pumpin' that iron with you. Did I introduce you to my friend Kilo? - Oh, hey. What's up, sexy? - Your weight. [ Laughing ] I love a woman that can make me laugh! [ Mouths Words ] Yeah! Mmm. Yo, kid. I think I could hit that. [ Laughing ] Believe me, you don't wanna go there. Yo, man. Who that? Man, that's Barbara. She lives upstairs on the top floor. Aerobics instructor. Sexy and limber. Very limber. Yo, kid. I'm-a go upstairs and see how limber that bitch really is. You understand me? Nah, nah, nah. Hold on. Hold on. Cardinal rule number one: - Never, ever mess with a girl in your building. - [ Air Hissing ] You'll live to regret it. Trust me. I know. [ Together ] But we don't live here! Come on, man. You know? I'll fuck anybody in these apartments. Shit. Now I'm gonna have to jack his shit up. Fine. Look, you want to put his ass in check? Jenny, you know I got your back. But let's not get sidetracked. Let's work on our presentation first. Then we'll work on your brother. Cool ? [ Man: R & B ] * You give me honesty * And that's hard to find Call David real quick, man. Let's see what's up with this brother. [ Rings ] [ Knocking ] Damn. Ow, man. Damn! Damn! [ Pounding On Door ] Ah, the phone. Ah, the phone! The phone. [ Woman ] David, if you don't open up this door, I'll kick this shit in! [ Muttering ] Think I won't? [ Ringing Continues ] Stop it! Hey! Stop making all that noise out there, Nadine. You're about to disturb my neighbors now. We can't talk right now, a'ight? I don't care about your neighbors! Okay, open up the door! David! David?

Okay, we gonna go upstairs? Right up there. Can we do it with the hat? I'll bring the hat. All right. Good. [ Mumbling ] David, I know you ain't got no hussy up in there! - You just an ignorant ass. I swear to God, you ignorant. - What did you just say? I know you didn't call me ignorant. I know-- [ Phone Ringing Continues ] Boy, you better open-- [ Panting ] Now, girl, didn't I tell you never to come over here unless you call first? Well, obviously you're not answering your phone today, are you? And why do you got the chain on the door like you don't even know me? Huh? Nadine, this is not a good time for us to talk. Oh, no, we gonna talk. We gonna talk today. I need to-- Let me-- Come on, baby. Come on! Get your-- Ah! - [ Whimpering ] - [ Shouting ] Aw, now, look what you done did to my door! I can tell something's been going on in here. I can smell it. Oh, who's she? Oh, who's she? [ Muttering ] I'm his woman. Who are you, tramp? [ Phone Ringing ] Tramp? David! Hey, let me answer this phone. Don't even think... about picking up that phone. Something's wrong. What's the matter, man? David's answering machine ain't even picking up. Mmm. [ Gasps ] Oh, shit.

Don't do me like this, baby. [ Nadine Shouting ] Yeah, yeah. I know. Hey! Well, then go on then! What? Don't tell me-- You ain't nothing but a squirrel. Fuck you! It's my world. You trying to get a nut. Hey, it's drama. You know, women love that shit. Goddamn! - What the hell? Whoo! - Yo, kid! What the fuck happened in here? Oh, that ho got out of line, so I had to, you know, kick her ass out, let her know who's running things up in here. Running things, huh? From the look of it, look like she ran her foot in your little whipped cream ass. [ Laughing ] Look, Spootie, man, just chill, man. Come on. Give him a break. No, man. I'm sayin', look how he's dressed. He's butt-naked in some cowboy boots. See, now, what Nadine need is a real cowboy behind her, hittin' that ass. Hah!

See, what you need to be doin' is talkin' about this. What is this? Oh, no. Oh, here. That was Nadine accidentally walkin' in-- She just happened to-- Just messin' around-- Put her foot in your ass. Okay. Hey, brah, brah. Nigga, please. You crazy? I admit, she tried to slap me, but I grabbed her hand like you told me. I said, "Hey, you ain't slapping me no more. It's the last time you slappin' up in here. A'ight? Your ass is dismissed. I will deal with your ass when I'm ready to deal with your ignorant ass." That's enough, man. Come on. We had enough. All right? Why can't you just keep it real with us? We're your boys! Family! You know what I'm sayin'? Come on, man. Why can't you tell us what really happened, man? "I was over here tryin' to get some ass. She came in. She started buggin', and she slapped me. I love her, man." [ Kilo Cackling ] You know, you sound just like that fool kid. [ Laughing ] Yee-hah! I'm sorry, man. I'm serious. I'm sorry. My bad. Man, my bad, D. I'm serious. Come on. Get up, man. Get up, man. Come on! Man, get up! [ Whimpers ] Shake it, cowboy. [ Kilo Laughing ] It don't-- It don't fit. Man! You know what your first mistake was, man? Why did you even bring her here? [ Kilo, Spootie Laughing ] Huh? Come on. What's up with that? Your second mistake-- Why did you let Nadine in? Look at the door! Does the door look like I let Nadine in? - [ Kilo Giggling ] - Look like she knocked that bitch off the hinge. Yes! Yo, you know what, man? Look. We all need some air. Come on. Let's get out of here! Come on, y'all. That's what I'm talkin' about. So what's his type? All of his women are different-- like night and day. You see, if I could just find pictures of him with them, then I could send them to all of them. They could see what type of a ho he really is. That's what I'll do. Hey, we can also project them on the overhead during our presentation. Ooh, good idea. Uh-huh. How many women do you think he has? Not women! Chicken heads! Hood rats! Hos! Come on, Jenny. Not all men are dogs and niggas. And we're not all bitches and hos. [ Sighs ] You know, Katrina. Katrina, I don't know. I don't know what type of men you've been around, but, you see, my brother is a dog. All of his friends are dogs, and Michael Jones is the dog of all dogs! Oh. So that's what this is all about. Look. I'm just pissed off right now, okay? I'm tired of brothers dropping sisters like a bad habit. And then to make it even worse, they told me how much of a cold freak he was in bed. Like with the ice and handcuffs and hot lotion... and nipple-pinchers and feathers... and fried zucchini and baby diapers! [ Shuddering ] Like I wanna know all of that! I do. Katrina, please don't become a statistic. Oh! No, no. [ Laughing ] No, not in this lifetime. I just want to know more about him for our case study research. Man, but I was raised by nothin' but women, and I still can't figure them out! [ Laughing ] Hell! That's 'cause you ain't tried, D. Like my sister, right? For example, she thinks she's so slick. You know the real reason she came by my place today? 'Cause her and her girlfriend are using me as a case study for her anthropology class. Like right now, they're still at my place. Right now, all up in my business. I'm gonna check his drawers. Girl, he don't wear drawers. He nasty like that. Katrina. Katrina. [ Moaning ] Katrina. Katrina. Katrina! You ain't hear me calling you, girl? Uh-- You're supposed to help me look for the pictures! Thanks to Jenny, Katrina's a done dish. The booty is just marinatin' for me! [ Laughing ] She done told her everything about me already, you know? Right now she just thinking she wanna find out for herself. So you think you're all that. Okay. Check this out. [ Beeping ] They ain't gonna be home. [ Phone Ringing ] Jenny, I know you're not gonna answer his phone, are you? The hell I ain't. Watch this, girl. [ Beeps ] Stop, baby, stop. Hello. Ah. What you doin' answering my phone? Huh? Huh? Look at you! You ain't got nothin' to say, right? Caught red-handed, mouth wide open. I knocked over the phone by accident! Tsk. Look, don't start lyin' 'cause you got caught doing dirt. I ain't even tryin' to hear that. But, uh, how's that research on me goin'? How'd you know we was doin' research on-- I know you, Jenny. But most of all, I know women. [ Chuckling ] Yeah. Well, don't flatter yourself that much, Mr. Man, 'cause you're a beast about to get busted. Look, how many times I gotta tell you, players never get busted? I am so sick of brothers thinking that they are players. Oh, like Michael Jones? [ Both Laughing ] You got me on speakerphone... so your loud, dysfunctional, stupid-ass friends can hear me? Who the hell do you think you are? [ Clattering ] [ Beeping ] [ Rings ] Hello! Hello, Jenny? I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Oh, yeah, you sorry, all right. You sorry motherfucker! Damn. Now he's all sorry. Shit. He done stepped on my last nerve. That's it. Calling here with that bullshit. Putting me on display in front of his old, stupid-ass friends. I got a display for his ass. We're going to Maxwell's party. Yeah. So all his girls can meet in the flesh. At the party. Uh-huh. Oh, shit! Create a hostile environment-- [ Together ] And a player will repent and reform! [ Laughs ] Oh, yeah, baby. So come on. Help me find that phone book. Okay. 'Cause it's high time that Robin meets Sherri, Sherri meets C.C.... and C.C. meet that trifling ass Ashenkashay. [ Loud Burp ] [ Kilo ] What was that? [ Spootie ] That's your stomach. I need y'all to chill for a minute, right? I'll be right back. Hold up, man. Hold up. Hold up. I thought we was going with you. What's up? Spootie, this is not that type of party, man. Besides, won't take me too long 'cause she's married. Married? [ Sighs ] Wait a minute. Hold on, man. Don't knock it till you try it, D. A married woman is a player's dream. They can't demand a lot of your time. Very understanding. Flexible. Most importantly, appreciative. Who does he think he is, Dray Don Juan? That's the shit I'm talkin' about right there. Hi, sweetheart. See? That's why I ain't never gon' get fuckin' married. Married? Man, you lucky if you get laid. [ Mocking Kilo's Laugh ] What do we have here? I made us some tea. Mmm. Oh, goodness. [ Sighs ] What's wrong, sweetheart? I can't take him anymore. Buster? [ Exhales ] No. Leave that alone. You know what you need? A massage. Come here. Turn around. Ah. [ Spootie, Kilo, David Chattering ] [ Dray ] Let me take care of you. Mmm. Mmm. Oh! Oh. You're so tense. Oh, hell. He cares more about those damn plants than he does me. With all these plants in here, he still can't recognize a beautiful flower when he sees one. What a fool. [ Laughs ] You're so adorable. * [ Car Stereo: Rap ] * Quick to get hot if I catch you on the wrong block * [ Chattering ] This is where they go to the bridge. Go to bridge, go to bridge! * [ Continues ] Cut your fucking music down in front of my house, man. Hey! My lovely wife's trying to get some rest. People live on this block, you beige motherfucker. Fuck you, motherfucker. Fuck yourself, man. Hate you young son bitches. You don't do shit. You don't vote. Fuckin' rabbits. All you do is eat, shit and fuck. That's all right. Your mama's a man. I'll bust your motherfucking-- Give me that bag. [ All Shouting ] Hate you motherfuckers. Hate them son bitches. [ Grunts ] [ Whispers ] Buster. Buster? Honey! Why are you here? What you think I'm doing here? I live here. I know you live here, but you're home early. Look here. Look here, baby. There's a bunch of smokes outside... playin' their damn music so loud, they're gonna bring our property value down. Oh, they're just kids. What you dressed like this for? What you wearin' that for? I was gonna take a nap. And you're just in time. Mmm. Yeah, I know that's right. [ Chuckling ] You know, it stinks in here. [ Gasps ] What's that smell? What smell? That smell like "boodussy"-- booty, dick and pussy. I'm telling you, it's all up in here. You're so funny. Funny nothing. It stink in here. No, it doesn't.

[ Dray ] Oh, like you was too smart for Michael Jones, who dropped you like a bad habit. Me and Mike is like-- We live by the same laws. Players. See, we don't take no prisoners, and you ain't no exception. You just a statistic. [ Jenny ] It's called negative reinforcement. Yes, given a hostile environment, a player will repent and reform, and that is the hypothesis of our report. I think black... will be more appropriate... for the burial of a player. [ Dray ] Yo, D! Let's roll, man! Come on! * [ R & B ] [ D.J. ] Hey, what's up, y'all? This is Jesse Collins. We wanna give a phat shout-out to my man Maxwell... puttin' down a phat-ass party tonight.

I-- I don't know what I was thinking about. It was a stupid thing to do. Yeah, you got that right. N-- Nadine, I thought I wanted to be something that I'm not... and something I realize I never want to be. Nadine, I want us... to have what my parents have-- that forever shit, just me and you. Oh-- [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] But you're still sick. Have you ever thought about... me boning you... [ Gasps ] in your ass, in the rain? [ Chuckles ] You don't like the rain, huh? [ Moaning, Exclaiming ] Yeah! Yeah, it's my birthday! Yeah! [ Grunting ] [ Chuckling ] [ Gasps ] Hey! There's my girls right here. [ Laughs ] Whoo. I must admit, that was a pretty interesting experiment. Right? But you know what? Your premise was wrong. Let me ask you girls a question. If giraffes once had short necks like horses, why do they have long necks now? Because thousands of years ago... giraffes grew long necks in order to reach the foliage in the higher trees. Right. Foliage being their only food source, they adap-- adapted to their environment. Exactly. Certain animals reform. Others adapt. Like, if you put a player in a hostile environment... like this was, he won't reform. He'll rise to the occasion and prove his game, thus adapt. It's called survival of the fittest. Good night. * [ Continues ] You gonna be okay? You know what? [ Sighs ] It never was about my brother. [ Sighs ] Hi. I been watching you all evening. How 'bout I buy you a cup of coffee? [ Sighs ] I'll take that as a yes. Yeah. [ Woman ] * It's a man's * World * A bucket of ice. * [ Continues ] Now, some of you may be wonderin', what's up with the ice?

It's awful. I can't keep my eyes open. But luckily the hooker I'm gonna get tomorrow makes it all worth it. [ Chuckles ] I hear that. I'll see you later. Women love being served. [ Doorbell Rings ] * Man made the electric light * * [ Continues ] Katrina? I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. I'm gonna go get changed and I gotta go see my man. Thank you. Good night. Bye. See ya. * [ Continues ] Here are... the numbers of your ladies. [ Chuckles ] It won't happen again. Aw, it's no big deal. Forget about it. I'm sorry. Am I-- Are you expecting company? Yeah. Lisa should be here at 11:00. * Man makes 'em happy * 'Cause man makes them toys * Oh, well, um, guess I'd better get out of here before she comes... and thinks something's going on between us.
