[Crickets chirruping] [Female dispatcher chattering on radio] [Grunting] What's cookin'? It's all quiet here. How about you? Nothin'. It's almost midnight, let's close up shop. Unit 4-k-2. Request cancellation of code 9, seascape and kenmore. No sign of the prowler. (Female dispatcher) Control 1 to 4-k-2. Stand by. 4-k-2, watch commander advises continuing code 9 until 1:00 A.M. [Sighing] 4-k-2, k.L.B. 8-0-6. Even the psycho killer isn't psycho enough to come out on a night like this. What does that make US? I don't know. But it's your turn now, Charlie boy. Oh, thank you very much. [Dispatcher chattering] [Footsteps pattering] [Dog whimpering] [Door opening] [Door closing] [Footsteps pattering] (Valens) All right, hold it right there. I'm a police officer. Hold it! Hold it! [Gun firing] (Valens) Hold it. (Valens) Now, hold it! Now put the bag down. [Gun firing] Hey, Tom. What happened? He pulled a gun. I had to blow him over. We're police officers. Somebody turn on the pool lights. You, send for an ambulance. (Valens) They never look like they're supposed to. Bet he never knew what hit him. Hey, where's his gun? Oh, hell, it's probably in the pool. Take a look in his bag. I just hope you got him before he carved up another girl. Hey, Tom. Tom, look at this. (Valens) Dr. James b. Ruston. 166 Crescent road, bel air, California. That's our psycho killer? [Phone ringing] Valens, get in here. [People chattering] You look like something the cat dragged in. You ought to see the other guy. I have, in living black and white. What went wrong, Tom? You read my d.B. Report. Twice. But damn it, there has to be more to it than that. There isn't. I gave it to you exactly as it happened. He, uh, pulled a gun. (Klodin) What gun? What do you mean, "what gun?" Are you sure you saw one? What's goin' on, Roy? How long have you been back on active duty? 7, 8 months, you know that. And the wound still giving you trouble? Yes, captain, the wound gives me trouble. Tonight's scene was almost a repeat of that liquor store heist a year ago. Wasn't it? What? Except then you had a punk kid trapped in an alley. A punk so scared he opened fire while you were still trying to talk him out of his gun. Well, that's ancient history. Is it? Or is the memory gonna spook you every time you see some suspect reach for his wallet? All right, Roy, just what in the hell is goin' on around here? [Phone ringing] [Siren wailing] Klodin. Yeah. Yeah. Are you positive? Ok. Right. In the morning. That was musso. They can't find ruston's gun. That is just impossible. I'm going to go down there and help him find-- no. As of tonight, you're relieved of all further field duty. I'm what? You'll work a desk job until the inquest is over. How come? Let's just call it doctor's orders. Look, Roy, I saw the gun. I saw the gun in the man's hand. Now how can they miss anything that big? No talking till the inquest. And then be prepared for rough sledding. This one's gonna get bloody. Why should it? Because Dr. James b. Ruston, so far he checks out like Mr. Clean and Santa claus rolled into one. Money, society, the whole bit. And if you're still thinking of him as our psycho killer, he had an airtight alibi for every one of those other killings. You read me? Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone, this is Jerry Dunphy, with headlines of the hour. Los Angeles. 3 days after the death of Dr. James b. Ruston, the question of "why? Why did it happen?" Is still being asked by irate citizens across the city as authorities continue to piece together the facts behind this tragic episode. [Crowd chanting] Valens, no. Valens, no. Police brutality must go. When I was young, a policeman was always a friend, someone to be trusted. But now it's different. Police are different. And how do I explain sergeant valens to my children? How do I say to them, "trust him, "let him help you across the street even though his hands are bloody"? It's a protest, baby. To sing out that the sadists and finks are tryin' to take over here, man. About valens, me and my people say, "throw the bum out." I'm just here to see if the same punishment they would have used on me if I had killed an innocent man will be applied to this valens case, or will he get the usual coat of whitewash? The people speak. Meanwhile, funeral services for Dr. Ruston will be held Friday at the first community church, Beverly Hills. A native californian, Dr. Ruston led an active life as a sportsman when he wasn't busy with his patients or relaxing with his wife and son. Here we see him receiving an award from the Mexican-American foundation for his work among the villages of lower California. Concerned by conditions he'd encountered there, on a hunting trip several years ago Dr. Ruston, who piloted his own plane appointed himself chief physician for the area and made frequent trips to the village of San rosario, where he could always count on receptions like this. Finally, Dr. Ruston's widow, as she arrived home yesterday from Hawaii where she was vacationing when news of her husband's untimely death reached her. As for sergeant valens, the 10-year veteran is playing it tight giving out only his name, rank, and serial number and hoping the explosion he's set off will burn itself out after today's coroner's inquest. Yes, sir. This is the gun that sergeant valens always carries. I, uh, recognize the hand grips. When you reached him, sergeant, was his gun still in his hand? Yes, sir. Can you remember the first words he said to you? Uh, something like, uh, "he tried to pull a gun I had to blow him up." [People muttering] (Jerez) What about this 2nd gun? Was it in evidence? No, sir. It was not. Did you search for it? Well, not right away. Since the gun wasn't on the ground, I naturally assumed that the gun had fallen in the pool with the suspect. That seemed like the natural place for it. And then, of course, we were kept busy trying to identify the suspect, and, keep the people away. Uh, well, how soon afterward did you actually begin to hunt for the suspect gun? About, uh, 3 or 4 minutes after the ambulance arrived. And then, Tom, that's sergeant valens, had to take his report into headquarters and I was assigned to collect the physical evidence. And? There was no gun. I take it you made a thorough search? Oh, yes, sir. Some officers and I went over the whole area with a fine-tooth comb. Including the swimming pool? I beg your pardon? Including the swimming pool? Oh, yes, sir. I had the, uh, the manager drain the pool, and the gun was not there. All right, I have no further questions, thank you. Mr. Sanderman, does the district attorney's office have any questions? Thank you, Mr. Jerez. Yes. Uh, actually, I'm a little concerned about, uh, whether anyone could possibly have removed the, uh, alleged gun from the premises without the police knowing about it? Oh, well, that's hardly likely, sir. You see, the area was posted and only official personnel were allowed on the scene. I see. Therefore, since you were unable to find Dr. Ruston's gun, isn't it logical to conclude that no such gun ever existed? Well, I will say this, sir. I've known sergeant valens since he first joined the force, and if he says the suspect was armed, I'd be inclined to agree with him. [People muttering] And over the years, he's proven that he's no trigger-happy cop who pushes the panic button when the pressure is on. I can say this because I've seen him under fire, taking all kinds of hell. And personally, I don't know of any officer in my command I'd sooner trust my life to than Tom valens. Captain, I'm sure we all agree that sergeant valens' prior record is above reproach. Maybe you can tell US why he failed to fire a customary warning shot when he tried to stop Dr. Ruston. You know we don't fire a warning shot. Yes, I know. Tell them. Our officers are instructed never to shoot unless it's absolutely unavoidable. This is to prevent hitting some innocent bystander. Thank you, captain. Now, Mr. Sanderman? Captain, in view of what you were just saying, isn't it absolutely essential for every police officer to be, among other things, a man of excellent judgment? (Klodin) Of course. Did sergeant valens exercise excellent or, even good judgment in this particular instance, do you think? He had no alternative. Remember, he was staked out in search of a killer, a psychopath who has already butchered 3 victims in Los Angeles this month. It's created an atmosphere of fear-- now just a minute. Are you suggesting that mass hysteria can justify the taking of a human life? No. Because if you are, I'm afraid that you are-- [people muttering] No, damn it. I'm not. [Gavel pounding] Sergeant valens acted on the facts as he saw them at the moment. I can't blame him for that. Much as I might wish that things had turned out differently. [People muttering] (Jerez) Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god? Of course. An oath is very sacred to me. Will you sit down, please? Thank you. Now then, will you tell US your name and where you live? Alice willows. No, please, into the microphone, miss willows, and speak to them. Alice willows, seascape apartments. Thank you. Now, miss willows, first of all I want to say how much we appreciate your coming here today. You were Dr. Ruston's patient, miss willows. He was a wonderful doctor. The only one who ever cared the least bit what became of me. I don't know what I'll do now that he's gone. Well, now, last Thursday night, Dr. Ruston visited you at your apartment. Isn't that right? He came ev-- he came every Thursday. He treated me for my diabetes. It was his regular visit. Yes. Now, according to the investigating officer, Dr. Ruston came to your apartment about 11:00 and he left shortly after midnight. And was that customary? Yes. Yes. Then if-- he knew I'd be awake. It's part of my condition. Some nights I don't sleep at all. And then in the daytime, there's all that racket. People splashing in the pool and shouting at the top of their lungs. I've complained to Mr. Garvin, but he wouldn't listen either. I think it's terrible. Yes, I'm sure it is, miss willows. Uh, getting back to last Thursday night. Did you notice anything different, I mean something, unusual about Dr. Ruston? No. He was the same as usual. Oh. He did complain about the fog. Said he hoped it would lift before he had to leave. But it didn't. So, he got up and patted my face then went out the door looking for Caesar. Who is Caesar, miss willows? My dog. He's been with me for years. A longhaired terrier. You don't see many of them anymore. They've gone out of fashion. But I'd rather have Caesar than 10 French poodles with fancy pedigrees. Miss willows, may I ask you, uh-- Dr. Ruston felt the same way. Always brought him something soft to eat or a toy. I don't know how I'll ever make Caesar understand what's happened-- you say Dr. Ruston went outside to look for Caesar. Now you're sure of that? Oh, yes, and when I heard all that shouting, I thought he'd found him. Then that terrible shooting. So loud. I just knew something awful had happened. I started to shake. Why, even when Caesar scratched at the door, I couldn't let him in for the longest time. Caesar was trembling, too. He went right to his basket and wouldn't come out until daybreak. Poor Dr. Ruston. Do you think I've done him some good? [People muttering] *[music playing] [People chattering] Where the hell did you go? I've been lookin' all over for you. Now that you've found me, hurrah. Don't make me the heavy. I did the best I could. Hey, you're a good man, ed. No matter what anyone says. Another one, mister? Why not? Yeah, I'll have the same. Say, joanie called me this morning. Joanie who? Did you know she's working at a photography studio these days? She said ever since this thing broke, she's been calling you every night, but, uh, you won't pick up the phone. I repeat, joanie who? Oh, come on, Tom, she's still your wife. For 10 more days, then the final decree comes in. It's all over but the alimony. Well, she wanted to tell you the same thing we've been trying to push through that thick skull of yours. Tell them you thought you saw the gun. No. Tom, for god's sake, this case has kicked up emotions people didn't even know they had. Goody, goody, a cop goofed. Big daddy is human just like the rest of US. So let's get out the tar and feathers and the line forms on the right. Oh, come on, Tom. Look, just give them what they wanna hear. So you made a mistake. You're sorry, you thought you saw the gun. I didn't make a mistake. Now, damn it, ed, I saw the gun. I saw the gun. Here you go, gents. Drink hearty. [Coughing] What is that? Buttermilk. [Coughing] For those who think clean. Hey, it'll improve your eyesight. Now, sergeant valens, uh, in view of the testimony presented here today, I want to know if you care to amend your statement regarding the death of Dr. Ruston. No, sir. I reported the truth as it happened. Well, that's all right, but I'm sure you're aware of certain discrepancies between, your version of the truth, and the truth as other people have reported it. Yes, sir. However, I would like to say this: No matter how much testimony is given to the contrary, whether it concerns Dr. Ruston's motives for being at seascape or whatever, it doesn't alter the fact that he did run from me in a suspicious manner and when cornered, he pulled a gun. That's the truth, the truth as I know it. (Jerez) Well, what about this gun, can you describe it to US? My impression was of a 38 caliber pistol, 3 or 4 inch barrel. I only saw it for a second. You're quite sure it was a gun? It couldn't have been some other object maybe a fountain pen or-- no, it... No, it was a pistol. Mr. Sanderman. Sergeant, you say when you first observed the suspect, he was behaving in a suspicious manner. Could you, uh, elaborate? It was the way he stood, the way he moved. (Sanderman) Uh, anything else? When you've been a police officer for as long as I have, you, uh, you begin to know instinctively when a man has something going on. But he was doing nothing of an overt criminal nature at the time? No. Yet you say a few moments later you, uh, shot at this man in order to save your own life? That--that is correct? I shot in self-defense. I don't believe that I consciously, that-- that my intent was to kill. I, uh, take it then that in your own mind, you're completely satisfied, uh, with your actions? I don't think anyone is completely satisfied about killing a man. Other than that, my answer would have to be yes. Sergeant, I understand, uh, about a year ago, you suffered a bad stomach wound in somewhat similar circumstances. Could this possibly have been on your mind last Thursday night? It's not something you forget. No, I guess not. Uh, after that incident, you were quoted as saying that you would never again let a man pull a gun on you. Do you recall that statement? Well, I... I may have said it. But if I did, it was a stupid remark. Sergeant, uh, since returning to duty, have you participated in many cases where the suspect was armed and resisting arrest? No, sir. Last Thursday night was the first time. Sergeant, one final point. Uh, the gun you saw, was it in Dr. Ruston's hand or only in your mind? The gun was in Dr. Ruston's hand. (Reporter #1) I need a statement. Excuse me, pardon me. Come on, Mr. Sanderman, what do you think the verdict will be? No comment. Oh, give US a break. Are you gonna go after valens, too? Look, if the coroner's jury brings in a verdict of criminal negligence you can be assured my office will prosecute. (Reporter #2) What will you ask for, though? Let's wait and see. Yeah, but have you enough of a case to make the charges stick? Well, frankly, gentlemen, at first I didn't think so. Not until I listened to the one witness who seems determined to Bury sergeant valens alive. Who's that? [People chattering] Mr. Valens, I've noticed you're not represented by counsel. Any particular reason for that? I haven't had time to hire an attorney, your honor. In that case, I'm prepared to Grant you a 24-hour continuance so that you may obtain counsel, if you so desire. No continuance is necessary, your honor. Let the record show that the defendant chooses to stand in propria persona. I'd like to advise you of your rights, and the rights of the court in this matter. You're being arraigned here on a charge of manslaughter. Now you've heard the complaint against you and you have the right to plead either guilty or not guilty to the charge. You may also, if you wish, request the court for time in which to answer the complaint. Depending upon your decision, the court will then rule as it deems proper. Is that clear? Yes, sir. Very well, Mr. Valens. How do you respond? Not guilty. Then the court orders you to return in 10 court days for the preliminary hearing on the charge. Your honor, uh, my office requests appropriate bail be set to guarantee the defendant's appearance. (Jerez) Mr. Sanderman, do you have reason to believe that the defendant does not intend to abide by the jurisdiction of this court? I'm merely trying to protect the public interest, your honor. Very commendable. However, failing evidence of such intent, and in view of Mr. Valens' position as a police officer, I see no reason for not releasing him on his own recognizance pending his preliminary hearing. Thank you, your honor. (Jerez) Can we continue with the arraignment calendar, please? Sanderman. Can I talk to you for a minute? What's there to say, sergeant? You're in one corner, I'm in the other. Good luck and come out swinging. Hasn't anyone told you we're on the same side? Believe it or not, some of my best friends are police officers. Why, I'd even let one of them marry my daughter. That's no answer. Why are you pushing me? Because you're a special breed. The first time I saw your kind of cop, I was a kid back in Chicago. I watched one of you smash in the skull of a dumb hunky. He'd wandered into the wrong section of town and he couldn't understand 5 words of English. He just happened to be my father. And, that's why, whenever the chance comes to cut one of you bastards down to size, it just warms the cockles of my heart. I get the message. Also, get yourself a good lawyer. You looked dumb up there today, valens. Dumb like a hunky. And everybody knows what happens to them. 4, please. Indeed, yes. I'd be most interested in taking your case, sergeant. I have followed it very closely. Good. Then we can get started. However, I'm not sure that you will want to hire me after you hear what I've got to say. I'm listening. As your attorney, I'm afraid I'd feel obliged to plead you guilty. In exchange for clemency. In other words, try for a deal with sanderman. But, Mr. Ames, I'm not guilty. Doesn't that mean anything? Damn little, my friend. But that's why I want to hire you. With you on my side, I can fight this and win. I swear to you, I'm right. You're in the right only if a jury says you're in the right. Use your head. Let me try for a deal. You'll get no worse than probation out of it. Afterwards, you can pick up the threads-- Mr. Ames, I'm a police officer. That's what I am. That's what I do best. If I plead guilty, I'm through. And-- and what'd be left wouldn't be worth stooping down for. I was a Navy career officer. Came the war, I found out a man can begin over when he has to. Face it, sergeant. Your career as a cop ended when you pulled that trigger. No, sir. Whether they convict you now or not, the verdict's in. In the public's eye, you will always be a cop who shot an innocent man. There's only one thing to do. Then you will plead guilty? No. I have to prove that Dr. James b. Ruston is not the innocent man that everyone thinks he is. Thank you for your time, sir. (Knowland) Well, it was a perfect burial. But then what can you expect from a town where nobody ever made a mistake until sergeant Tom valens came along. Forget the 12.5% increase in Los Angeles burglaries, forget our 40% increase in murders. Or the ever-growing number of teenage drug addicts crowding our jails. Never mind all that. We perfect ones must concentrate on lynching valens, the villain, for his insidious transgression. Or isn't it about time that we stopped acting like a mob of vigilantes and admitted maybe the rest of US aren't quite as perfect as we pretend? Let's even admit, and I want to suggest this before he achieves sainthood, that perhaps even Dr. James ruston made his share of errors, too. Of course, when a doctor makes a mistake, the worst he can expect is a civil suit for malpractice. The community doesn't throw rocks or banish him to Siberia. No, we realize that accidents will happen. Doctors are only human. Well, aren't cops human, too? And isn't it high time we told valens and every other police officer patrolling this city "it's ok, buddy. Nobody expects you to win them all." This is Perry knowland saying thank you and goodnight. (Director) Ok, that's a wrap. Ok. Watch those tight close-ups, will you? Uh, Mr. Knowland. Yeah. Mr. Knowland, I'd like to talk to you. Valens. Well now, let's play detective. Correct me if I'm wrong. You've been watching my show all week and you came hotfooting it down here to lick my hand, right? I would like to say thank you. Yeah, I bet you would. Hold that, will you? Listen, sarge, I think maybe you and I better understand each other very clearly right now. All that garbage I been spewin' about you all week, I don't believe a word of it. See you around. Well, then why did you say it? Well, now, it's easy to see you're not a very avid fan of mine, sarge. Because if you were you'd know my gimmick is playing the devil's advocate of television land. I'm the stone in the public shoe, the boil on the community backside. People tune me in for the pleasure of cursing me out. Whatever they're for, I'm against, and vice versa. And for that little distinction, I'm paid $300,000 a year. Next question? Pardon my stupidity. Well, now, hold on there, partner. Just a minute. If you, by any chance came here to dish the dirt on dear departed doc ruston, you, uh, couldn't have come to a better source. You see, we were members of the same golf club. Poor son of a gun never could break 85. He married into an old-line family of carmichaels. Down there, sweetheart. But I guess he and Doris didn't hit it off too well. Mostly, he went his way, she went hers, you know. Did they have any children? Oh, yeah. One boy, Philip. Dreadful little snot, spoiled rotten by his mother ignored continually by his father. In there. A typical happy family. Did Dr. Ruston play around? I, uh, I don't know. I never heard any rumors about that. But that could mean he was adept at covering up his tracks, right? Or, maybe he really was a Saint to abstain from all earthly pleasure in his devotion to helping the poor of Baja. That would really throw you, wouldn't it, sarge? Do me a favor, Mr. Knowland? At your service, chief. Be against me. I'd feel cleaner. [Scoffs] [Laughs] [Birds chirping] Lose something, pal? Just my sanity, pal. Yes? What is it? My name is valens. I'd like to ask you a few questions. Oh. If it's about a vacancy, you'll have to see Mr. Garvin. It's about Dr. Ruston. Oh. (Willows) Please sit down, young man. Oh, no, no, not there, please. That's Dr. Ruston's chair. I always save it for him. We'll have a cup of tea together. Orange Jasmine. It's my favorite. Did you know him? Not exactly. [Dog growling] Caesar, mind your manners. This gentleman didn't come here to steal your toys. I don't think he likes me. We've met before. Oh. He's very old, and he hasn't got many teeth. That's why he growls at everybody. Thank you. I'm sure he's still a good companion. Oh. Yes. Since they took Dr. Ruston away, he's the only one I have to talk to anymore. Dear Dr. Ruston. Yes, wasn't he just the darlingest man? Always trying to make life easier. He even helped me find this apartment. Well, it's very nice. You're very lucky to have had a doctor willing to call on you at all hours. Oh, did Caesar find his Dolly? That's a good boy. Dr. Ruston gave it to him. I think that's why he loves it so. Miss willows, did you ever sign a paper making Dr. Ruston your beneficiary? Of course not. Did you lend him money? Oh. That's a terrible thing to say. How do you account for the special treatment he showed you? He liked me. He did. He liked me. And anyway, my father put all my money in trust. The bank looks after everything. More orange Jasmine, young man? Don't be shy. Help yourself. No, thanks. Oh. Caesar and I enjoyed your company. Thank you. Next time we'll have pink gardenia. It's my favorite. [People chattering] [Birds chirping] [Speaking in French] [Clearing throat] Just think, I flunked high school French 3 years running. Hey, if you're makin ' a survey, my favorite book's little women. You're valens, the cop they busted. I saw your picture in the paper. What are you doin' out here? I'm trying to get my job back. Yeah? Cody. Walt Cody. Come on in, rest your weary gumshoes. Always glad to talk to a fellow outcast. I don't want to interrupt the French lesson. [Chuckling] Yvonne? She's a tinker toy. You wind her up, she doesn't bother calling again for days. Come on in. In here, Sherlock. [Door closes] Pure vitamin d. It does wonders for a man. Would you believe I'm 74 years old? Sunshine's free. What, and have all the goodies around here thinkin' I'm a spoiled, lazy bum? You mean you're not. [Laughing] The deductive mind at work, huh? You see a virile young stud loafin' around his pad in the middle of the day and right away you think, "aha, little lord moneybags, with a bankbook where his backbone ought to be," right? Yeah, something like that. Well, I'm sorry, valens, but I'm just another workin' stiff. I fly those great metal birds you city folks call airplanes. [Grunting] You're a pilot. Well, only to beautiful women, small boys, and my mother. To trans-coastal airways, I'm a copilot. Which in my little caste system world means a hell of a difference. But that's my problem. I'd rather hear about yours. Take your time, I don't have a plane out till 4:00. Just walking around trying to pick up the pieces. Yeah, well, I wish I could help you, but the sorry fact is I wasn't even here the night it happened. The airport got fogged in, and they diverted US to Burbank and bussed US home. By the time I got here, the bang-bang was all over. That's the story of my life. I'm never where the action is. [Panting] Well, thanks anyway. Hey, what's your rush? A friend of mine flew in some high-test scotch yesterday. No, thanks. Nowadays my drink's buttermilk. Buttermilk? Have you seen a doctor? Oh, I'm sorry that's a bad joke. You remember Dr. Ruston around here much? Not here or anywhere else. Have you talked to the rest of the neighbors? All except an s. Sherman. He seems to be out of town for a while. You know anything about him? [Chuckling] Well, enough to know that her ain't a him. "S" stands for shari. She's a photographer's model. And, daddy, she makes the rest of the goodies around here look like basket cases. She live alone? Well, that's a matter of opinion. Mine is that she's got something frantic going with somebody, judging from the sound effects that filter through in the wee small hours. A boyfriend. Must be. Otherwise, why would she make herself off-limits to her friendly neighborhood neighbor? Maybe she doesn't like the athletic type. [Laughing] Hey, make that your first question when you get her under the lights, will you? And tell her I'm not bulgy, just flexible. [Doorbell ringing] Oh, must be another tinker toy. Hi. No, he does the winding. Hi. [Exclaiming] (Joanie) How does that look, frank? That's fine. Let's have a little more neckline. (Henderson) Now that's better. That's beautiful. Ok, honey. Here we go. What in the hell do you think you are doing? I'm just trying to make them more attractive, that's all. May I inform you, Mr. Henderson, that well-dressed ladies do not wear clothes? Well-dressed ladies allow the clothes to wear them. Would you mind getting away from my camera, please? Would you mind getting out of my life, please? I'm just photographing what people like. [Exclaiming] Mrs. Valens, would you mind taking care of something else and leave my mannequins alone? Yes. Would you mind not stepping on the drapes? [Phone ringing] I'll get off the damn drapes. Let's go with the session, we're wasting too much time. Let's go. (Woman) Joanie, telephone. Hello. Joanie, this is Tom. I'm sorry to bother you, but I need a favor. I'm sorry, sir, but if you check again I think you'll find you've dialed the wrong number. Please, joanie. [Sighing] Yes, go on. Your voice is beginning to ring a bell. I have to locate a model by the name of shari sherman. She lives at the seascape apartments in brentwood. Her mail indicates she hasn't been home since the night ruston died. I want you to check her out for me, the agency she worked for, photographers she might have worked for, anybody who might know where she is now. Yes, sir, yes. I understand. I'll get the brochure off to you as soon as possible. Very good, sir. Thank you for thinking of US. I never stopped. (Designer) All right, Susan, the look of disdain. Good girl. Take, sweetheart, come on, sweetheart. You're not giving me anything. You're so stiff. I can understand this. You're nervous, I understand. It's not your fault. Now look, this leg's extended in this fashion, the arm here rests very peacefully with this hand... What's so funny? I'm sorry, you--you just looked so... So what? You are both disappointed because we're not showing bosoms today. I have a suggestion for both of you. Take the day off. And take this square box that you call a camera, go to a farm, and photograph cows. I suppose you would prefer bulls. [Women laughing] Captain. Can I drop you somewhere? Oh, Tom. Thanks, I'm on my way to Felipe for a fast sandwich. I got to be back in a few minutes, special show-up. Sure, hop in. What are you doing downtown? Drivin' around. Happened to be in the neighborhood. Come on. Hungry? Famished. Uh, bad mood? Lousy mood. I guess it'd be foolish for me to tell you what I found out from hal Brody, the insurance investigator handling ruston's claim. It certainly would. Well, he came up with a very interesting bit of information. It seems ruston was a gambler. You know, cards, horse races, crap tables, you name it. He was in debt up to his teeth. He even borrowed on his life insurance. Then about 2 years ago, he paid off all his debts. He'd been livin' pretty good ever since. Turn left at the next traffic light. Want to see a picture of a pretty girl? Name's shari sherman. Lives at the seascape apartments. I think she's ruston's mistress. You gotta be kidding. No. Thanks to joanie, I spent an hour with the photographer that uses her the most. He told me she's been livin' with a married man secretly for almost 2 years now. Yeah, so? So that's what bothered me. Dr. Ruston's night calls on miss willows, it didn't make sense. It makes a hell of a lot more sense when you know that shari sherman lives in the next apartment. Go on. Yeah. The photographer also told me that shari has an ex-husband, the jealous type, the type that won't let her go. That brings US to last Thursday night. The night of the stakeout. What about it? I think the ex-husband found out about the affair. He threatened to blow the lid off the whole thing. So when ruston came by for his usual Thursday night visit, shari gave him the bad news. "Be careful, my husband's on a rampage." He gets out of there in a hurry, and spends some extra time with miss willows looking out the window at the fog. But really looking for Herman, the homicidal husband. Exactly. He finally decides the coast is clear, he sneaks out the building, and is hurrying towards his car, when suddenly a man jumps out of the bushes, yells at him to stop. He panics and... It all fits, Roy. Yeah. But that still leaves the missing gun. Well, if I can get into shari's apartment maybe I can find something that ties shari with ruston. That'll explain what happened to the gun. But how can you get into shari's apartment without a search warrant? Oh, you rat. You low, conniving rat-fink rat. Seems you people like to bother US. I haven't finished my supper yet. Hey, what's miss sherman done, anyway? Just routine. Let's go. I think we got a dead one. Smells like it's been here awhile. (Klodin) Tom. [Water running] All I can give is a curbstone diagnosis, but I expect the post will bear me out. Death was caused by surgical abortion. It was a clumsy job, resulting in massive hemorrhaging. Could it have been self-inflicted? Here. Thanks. Impossible. This was a d and c, performed, much as I hate to admit it, by a trained doctor. But if a doctor did the job, wouldn't he have seen something was wrong and been able to save her? Sure. If he had stayed around to keep an eye on the situation. My guess is that when she slipped into shock, there was no one there to treat her. Can you tell how long she'd been dead? Maybe more than a week, maybe less. You can pick any number you like. All right, I pick Thursday, a week ago. Why not? Why not? Roy, I make it this way. Ruston was shari's lover. She got pregnant, he talked her into an abortion, he performed it. He came back last Thursday night to check on her and found her dead. Now can't you just see him in miss willows' apartment listening to her talk, all the while trying to figure out a way to save his own skin. (Klodin) Tom, we haven't turned up one fact connecting ruston with the girl. He's scared. He's guilty and he's scared. He's so scared, all he can think of is to run. So he runs. He runs into me, a cop. I hate sounding like a broken record, but what about the gun? Now, first things first. If I can prove that ruston's guilty of criminal abortion, I got me a whole new ball game. Tom, look, go slow, this is all theory. There's no proof, and the minute... Hey, it's valens. Who let them in? Get them outta here. (Reporter #1) Are you the one who found her? No comment. (Reporter #2) Were you her secret lover? No comment. Did her husband know about you? (Klodin) What kind of a question is that? Come on, give US a statement. He's not gonna answer that question. Did she pull a gun on you, too? No, she didn't. Then who did? Nobody pulled... (Reporter) You afraid to make a statement? I'm not afraid to make a statement. (Klodin) No, Tom. Don't. They want a statement. I'll give them a statement. I've called this conference today to answer certain allegations in connection with the death of miss shari sherman. Sergeant Tom valens is asking that his suspension from the Los Angeles police department be lifted immediately in the light of new evidence he feels links miss sherman with the late Dr. James b. Ruston. The implication being that the doctor was her lover and that he performed an illegal operation on the young woman which resulted in her tragic demise. Gentlemen, I hold a statement signed an hour ago, by a Mr. Arthur elmore of this city. Mr. Elmore is a married man but he's had the courage to come forward voluntarily to admit that he, and he alone, was miss sherman's secret paramour and the man responsible for her operation. He also gave US the name and address of the unlicensed quack who performed this dreadful butchery and we are now holding both these men in our custody. Thank you, gentlemen. That's all I wanted to say. What will now happen to valens? It's one thing to shoot down an innocent man, but to deliberately smear his memory with lies and false accusations is beyond contempt. I personally assure you that sergeant valens' suspension will stand. And his trial in the death of Dr. Ruston will proceed as scheduled. (Klodin) Damn it, I don't care why you did it. You did it. I tried to warn you, but no, you had to go shooting your mouth off. (Valens) I made a mistake. I'm sorry. I... You're sorry. Big deal. Because of you, I've been on the carpet all morning trying to explain why we were at the sherman apartment in the first place. After this, I'll be lucky if I keep my division. Roy-- no. I've had it. I'm through. Go do your whining someplace else. Me, I'm sorry I ever laid eyes on you. [Door opening] Hello. It's freezing in here. I'll light a fire. [Gas hissing] [Gas igniting] [Keys dropping] Well, i--i don't have anything in the house to offer you. Unless you drink buttermilk. How are you, Tom? I haven't forgotten our divorce is final in 3 days. It's 3 days, 14 hours, and 7 minutes. So? So, I'm being good to the last drop. I'm much warmer now. Is this your idea of some kind of loyalty? Oh, I'm not that noble. I never was. I just had to see you again, Tom. Look, the job's gone. The war belongs to somebody else, and maybe there's a chance for US again. Tom, you never really needed me before, but now I think you do. Joanie. [Sighing] Am I making a complete fool of myself? No, I... Is there somebody else? There's never been anyone else. Don't just stand there. Need me. [Joanie panting] God. It's good to be home. Let's go away in a few days. Just the 2 of US. But first we must find you the best lawyer in town, and make everyone see how deeply you regret this whole thing ever happened. The things people... People are saying about me, do you believe them? Those awful stories in the papers? Of course not. How could I? I mean, do you think I did wrong? I don't know. I don't care. Look, just tell them you're sorry. Anybody can make a mistake. I didn't make a mistake. Joanie. Hmm? Honey, I'd like to stay in your arms forever, but I can't. I didn't make a mistake. Tom? Do you know what it took for me to come here tonight? I think so. Well, then, please, meet me halfway. (Valens) You don't mean halfway, joanie, you mean your way. Nothing's changed, has it? No, unfortunately nothing's changed. You fool. You stupid fool. [Door closing] [Door closing] [Metal clinking] Oh, hi. The inventory's on the desk. You can take it with you or sit down and check it off right now. You must be Mr. Johnson. My. You sound so much older on the phone. Well, everybody says that, miss thayer? Right. That's a good beginning, one registered nurse. Oh. Terribly sorry, sir, but I am not part of the furnishings. Thought you were a fixture around here. No. I'm too young to be a fixture. Besides, these days, 3 years on the job doesn't even qualify me as a junior fixture. So I guess Monday I'll have to start looking for another job. Ugh. Well, I wouldn't think you'd have too much trouble finding a job. No. But you know a job like this comes along once in a lifetime. And I guess I'm spoiled. Dr. Ruston, uh, nice guy to work for, huh? Oh, was he? Gee, the hours were terrific. And the work was a snap, and... Well, since that first year when things were a little tight, he practically tripled my salary. Hmm. Must have had a very rich clientele. Oh, no. [Phone ringing] Excuse me. (Thayer) Hello, Dr. Ruston's office. Yes. Yes, sir, all right, i-- I'll be expecting you. Why, that was Mr. Johnson. He said he won't be coming in today after all. And what did you say your name was? I didn't. But it's valens. Tom valens. Oh, no. You're not the man who murdered him. Miss-- stay away from me. Miss thayer, nobody was murdered. How can you come in here like this to his office, smiling and joking? What kind of a human being are you? A desperate human being. I need some answers. Yeah, well, just get out of here. All I want-- go on, get out. Miss thayer-- look, if you don't get out of here in 5 seconds I'm going to scream. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. [Screaming] [Door opening] [Door closing] [Groaning] (Man) Come on, rusty, he's had it. Let's split. Oh, my god. What happened? Can you walk? Lean on me. Come on, sit down right here. Give me your jacket. I better call a doctor. No doctor. But you might be badly hurt. A doctor would have to call the police. Don't you want whoever did this to you punished? You know a kid named rusty? That's Philip's nickname. Dr. Ruston's son. No doctor. No police. What difference does that make? By the time the papers got through with it, i--I'd be accused of beating up Dr. Ruston's son and the 3 boy scouts who came to his rescue. Now, you just patch me up as best you can. I got an appointment. You can't be serious. You can barely walk. I'll walk or crawl, I've got to get out of here. I got 3 days left. You find something and clean me up and send me on my way. Now, go on. Go on. You scare me, you know? Before, I thought I had you all figured out. Guilty as sin. And now? You're so damn sincere, I can't stand it. And you smell good. You don't. Answer a question for me? Sure. How does a doctor who 3 years ago couldn't make ends meet, and with the same small list of patients, is able to die a wealthy man? No big mystery. Dr. Ruston played the stock market a lot. Somebody gave him a tip on some Canadian stock that came in. He told me about it when he raised my salary. Also, I've-- I've seen the dividend checks that came in for him once a month from his broker, Calvin York. I thought dividend checks only came in once or twice a year. Well, not these. They were as regular as tick-tock. And never for less than 2,000 or 3,000 dollars. See how simple? Here, this should fit. Let me take you to a doctor, please. No. Well, then at least let me drive you home. [Grunting] You just get me to my car, I can lick the world. Sure. But not until tomorrow. The world is not going to run away, Mr. Valens. [Birds chirping] [Children chattering] You still with US, Mr. Valens? Yeah. [Sighing] How long did Dr. Ruston stay on his trips to Baja? He'd go down every other Wednesday and come back the next day. Every other Thursday. What are you implying now? When I stopped him on Thursday he was scared. He had something on his conscience. Stop that, do you hear me? Why did he run from me? Dr. Ruston was an exceptional man. He never took one peso out of Baja. And the people worshipped him. Because they knew that the first and third Wednesday of every month, no matter what their miseries, they could count on seeing their Dr. Bueno. [Car horn honking] Wrong again. So wrong, I almost want to cry for you. Thanks. [Telephones ringing] [Typewriters clacking] Mr. Brody, Mr. York will see you now. Mr. Hal Brody, insurance investigator. It's a pleasure, Mr. York. My, my, did you have a fall? Well, it's really not that bad. Oh, well, please make yourself comfortable. Thank you. Now then, what can Irma and I do for you? Irma? There she is. Our instantaneous relay market analyzer. Irma for short. You see, even wall street has joined the jet set. Let a stock drop half a decimal and our clients know about it before it hits the ground. Well, how can I help you? I'm here about Dr. James b. Ruston. Oh, yes. I understand your firm handled all his stock investments. Yes. And my company is investigating his insurance claims, so naturally we're interested in his financial status. Yes, I imagine it would be. We would like a breakdown of all his dealings over the last, uh, couple of years. Hmm. His holdings, his bank deposits, his, uh, his investments, the money he got back, even his tax returns. Well, that's quite a tall order. Now, suppose I'm not prepared to honor it? Well, Mr. York, I don't want to get tough. Could turn into a very nasty court case. [Chuckling] [Clears throat] Louise, uh, call hal Brody's office like the sweet, sexy thing you are and, uh, ask him if our Yale alumni dinner is this week or next. I can't remember which. Boola boola, sergeant. I recognized you as soon as you came in. Why did you let me keep on talking? Well, I'm satisfied now. Now please don't bother to come back. Maybe I'd like to buy some stocks. You can do for me what you did for Dr. Ruston. Rags to riches in 2 short years. You're shooting in the dark, sergeant. Don't you ever learn? I guess not. (Operator) Ready with your call to Las Vegas, Mr. York. Well, well, prince valens returns. Hey, man, what clunked you? [Chuckling] Fraternity initiation. How are you? I'm still tinkerin'. What brings you back to dead man's gulch? Miss willows. Ah, well, let's save you footsteps. Sunbonnet sue and I had a lover's quarrel, and she's run home to mother. Uh-huh. No, no, kidding. I saw her leave early this morning. Well, if you feel like waitin' around, you can, uh, j-join me poolside. It's my first day out since the sun lamp broke. Between flights or did they fire you? Oh, they wouldn't dare. I'm the only one who knows how to wind up the big rubber band. Matter of fact, trans-coastal's given me a few days off for good behavior. I haven't cracked up a ship all month. Miss willows. Oh! I'm sorry. I've been to the cemetery. I visit him every day. How nice of you. Can we talk? (Willows) They were so rude this morning. I found one of his favorite toys in the closet. And of course I wanted it buried with him, along with the rest. But they said it was too late. Did you ever hear of anything so heartless and inhuman? Who are we talking about? Why, Caesar, of course. He died Saturday. Quite peacefully, poor darling. And after I bought him a lovely plot in the eternal rest pet cemetery, a guaranteed rustproof casket, they wouldn't even let him sleep happy. Do you think he'll miss it? I put in all the rest. No, I'm sure it'll be all right. He died of a broken heart. The vet said it was old age. But he didn't watch Caesar pining away after what that bad man did to Dr. Ruston. Speaking of Dr. Ruston-- I like to think they're together in eternity now. It can happen, you know. Uh, miss willows, you said Dr. Ruston visited you every Thursday night. Could you have been wrong? Could it have been every other Thursday night? Oh, no. Dr. Ruston enjoyed coming every Thursday. When was the last time he visited you? I just told you, last Thursday. We had tea together. Dr. Ruston was buried last Thursday. He's been dead a week. Dear, oh, dear. Where does time go? [Screaming] [Giggling] (Cody) I think we lost. How's that for a chapeau? Oh, here's the man. [Panting] A couple of days ago you said you wanted to help me. Did you mean it? Uh, probably not. I'm fickle. But tell me more. I think there's a connection between miss willows and ruston's trips to Baja. She doesn't know the answer, so I'll have to go down there. I'd like to leave tomorrow, Wednesday. That was his regular visiting day. Well, have a swinging trip. Don't land on a cactus. I can rent a plane, I can't fly it. That's why I need you to fly me down there. Well, in the immortal words of Nathan hale, what's in it for me? [People chattering] I can't pay you much. Well, baby, you're a ring-a-ding salesman. Ah, I'll think it over. I only have 2 days. I'm thinkin'. [Women giggling] (Cody) Hey, valens. I'll get US a bird. Shoot, I figure with your luck, you're bound to start world war III as soon as we land. And I'd never forgive myself, if I wasn't there to watch. [Cody laughing] I've an appointment to see Mrs. Ruston. My name is Tom valens. Right this way, please. [People chattering] [Birds chirping] Come wind, come rain, the fuzz never rests. I didn't come here for a rematch. Gonna tell my mom on me, valens? Sorry, but miss thayer beat you to it. Get lost. I want to see her. She's still in mourning. (Doris) Rusty, let Mr. Valens in. [Door closing] Mr. Valens. (Doris) Care for a drink? No, thanks. I'd like to talk to you alone. Run along, dear. I'm not gonna leave you alone with him. I'll be perfectly safe, so will Mr. Valens. [Swooshing] Sweet Philip. He's taken his father's death so hard. I can't imagine why, they scarcely knew each other. Come closer, Mr. Valens. I'm not wearing my contact lenses today. Sit here. [Sighing] Oh, do you hurt? Just when I breathe. I apologize for what happened. Philip thought he was avenging the family name. Of course, you have been giving it a rather sticky time lately. My husband keeping a mistress. [Laughing] Even if he'd had the desire, I promise you he never had the ability. Mrs. Ruston. [Exclaiming] Oh, dear. I'm not your picture of a bereaved widow, am I? Y-You would have preferred someone draped in black and weeping softly to organ music. Mmm. Frankly, I've got nothing to cry about. Strange, my admitting that to you, the man who killed him. Jim was a blob, a jellyfish. Oh, aren't I terrible? But am I any worse than you, ogling his widow? You see, Mr. Valens, you're no more noble than I am. We're 2 of a kind. I came here to talk about your husband. Oh, yes, yes, yes, down to business. How much will it cost me to forget about Philip's little escapade? You think I'm here to blackmail you? Name your price, Mr. Valens. Or do I have to lead you by the hand like every other man I've ever known? It may come as a hell of a surprise to you, Mrs. Ruston, but I can't be bought. And I didn't come here to ask your forgiveness. Now I want the answer to one lousy question, that's all. Go on. 2 years ago, your husband was broke. Now you're mourning him in money and martinis. Where'd he get it? At least my olive's black. [Laughing] So is my future. Now where did he get the money? Mmm. You're talking to the wrong person. Jim and I had an unspoken agreement. I never asked him how he made his money, he never asked me how I spent it. The stock market? Had a little a.T. And t. That was what his father left him. Does the name Calvin York mean anything to you? Sounds familiar. Hmm, let me see. Yes, I think I remember seeing that name on one of the funeral wreaths. Does that help you at all? Not much. They're going to send you to prison, aren't they? Well, they're going to try, but I'll be around for awhile. Good, I'm glad. Who knows, maybe we can arrange another little visit. After Philip goes to Yale. We're 2 of a kind, Mr. Valens, remember. 2 losers. And according to an old Chinese proverb, when you rub 2 losers together, sometimes you get surprises. Sometimes even fire. I'm a sore loser, Mrs. Ruston. A sore loser. [Laughing] I hope you don't think I was serious. I was only having a little fun. Yeah, sure. [Door opening] [Laughing] Looking for somebody? Uh... Dr. Ruston's nurse, uh. She said she'd be here till 5:00. Sorry, I just came on duty. You're a patient? Oh, no, I just got to do her a favor and pick up a bundle of clothes for some friends of hers. Yeah, well, uh, if she comes back again, tell her to call me. My name is valens. [Gas hissing] [Telephone ringing] Hello. It's baron Von Cody. Just wanted to tell you I commandeered the original 1918 spad that rickenbacker used. It's a single-seater, so you may have to ride the wing. I'll wear my long underwear. Hey, it's a good idea. I'll see you at the Santa Monica airport at 8:00 in the morning, ok? Ok. Walt, thanks. Just spell my name right on the insurance policy, will you? I'll see you at 8:00. [Crowd yelling on t.V.] [Crowd cheering] [Crickets chirruping] [Glass falling] [Gas hissing] [Telephone ringing] [Coughing] [Telephone continues ringing] [Coughing] [Coughing] [Coughing] [Hissing] [Hissing stops] Hello, ed. Hold it. [Coughing] Are you kidding? What's the gun for? Don't take another step. That's an order. What are you talkin' about? Face the wall. What do you mean, "face the wall"? I said, face the wall. What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you? All right, you can turn around. [Sighing] All right. What--what's it all about? You're under arrest, Tom. For what? The big one, murder. The murder of Liz thayer. Oh, no. Oh, no. How? When? The custodian found her in ruston's office. The place had been torn apart. Her body was stuffed in a closet. She'd been choked, and badly beaten. She was last seen in the office at 4:30. You were seen leaving that office around 5:00. I went there, the door was locked, I couldn't get in. The custodian said he saw you with your hand on the knob like you just closed the door. Tom, we found your fingerprints all over the treatment room. You said that ruston's office was torn apart. I was being polite. It looked like a tornado hit it. All the drawers were dumped on the floor, furniture smashed. Even the Mexican knick-knacks hanging on the wall were smashed. Like some maniac was trying to break everything he could lay his hands on. Somebody's looking for something and they can't find it. Who is? I don't know. Somebody. Somebody. Somebody's involved in this besides ruston. Sure. You are. The boys downtown figure you've been pushing that ruston gun story for so long, you flipped. The gun. And you tore that place apart yourself. The gun must be the answer to everything. What are you talkin' about? Give me a few more hours, ed, just a few more hours. Oh, swell. Come on, let's go downtown. No, you book me now, I'm finished. Pretend you didn't see me. Just give me a few more hours. Tom, are you crazy? There's an a.P.B. Out on you. You couldn't drive your car more than one block before they'd pick you up. Now, come on, let's go. Come on. Now, listen, now, wait a minute. No, no, see here! Don't make it worse than it is already. I can't help it. Now, you turn around. Just turn around. Boy, you really have flipped, haven't you? Turn around. Come on, put your hands behind your back. [Handcuffs clicking] Over there. Just a few more hours, ed. Go to hell. [Ringing] Yep? (Valens) Walt, this is Tom valens. Did I wake you? No, but our date's for 8:00. If you're thinkin' of flying to Baja tonight, get yourself another boy. The Baja trip is off. What I been looking for is right here. It's been here all the time. Well, that's great. Need any help finding it? I thought you'd never ask. Buddy, bring your muscles, we're gonna open a grave. [Car horn honking] [Police dispatcher chattering over radio] Oh, a police car yet. Next thing you're gonna tell me it's hot. No, it belongs to a friend of mine. [Crickets chirruping] [Owl hooting] [Fluttering] (Valens) Here it is. Are you sure you want to go through with this? Here, hold this. I'll dig first. Thanks. I prefer a running start in case anything goes, "boo!" [Panting] Hey, valens? Huh? As one body snatcher to another, what made you decide to go this route instead of by way of Baja? Dr. Ruston's money. I couldn't figure out how he got it. The more I thought about it, the more I was sure it had something to do with his behavior the night I stopped him. I didn't make the connection until tonight when I found out his office had been torn apart. Hey, I think I hit something. [Panting] [Grunting] You got it? Yeah. Boy, grave robbing. If it wasn't for the high pay and the beautiful surroundings, I'd have to consider givin' it up. Got it. [Exclaiming] What do we do with him now? Nothing. Nothin'? Valens, if you're looking to cop an insanity plea, you just qualified. Now there's what I'm lookin' for. What, a kid's toy gun? That's the same mistake Caesar made when he found it in the bushes. It had ruston's scent on it. And ruston was his pal, ruston brought him toys. So he took it home. This is the gun I've been looking for since the night I shot him. What, that piece of junk got ruston killed? Yeah, junk, Walt. Pure, unadulterated heroin. [Exclaiming] You cut it half a dozen times, it should be worth 50,000, 60,000 dollars. Ruston was runnin' a dope ring. Yeah, but not all by himself. He was contacted by Calvin York when he fell behind on his gambling debts. They knew about his mercy flights to Baja. So he became the messenger boy. Let's put it back. 50,000 bucks a trip. Not bad for a house call. [Grunting] Well, it worked because of-- because of his unique position. He'd made so many trips to Baja, I don't think the customs people even bothered to stop him anymore. See, he'd pick up the heroin in Baja on Wednesday. There you go. And deliver it to his local contact at seascape on Thursday. Oh, come on, valens. If you're trying to tell me that little old miss willows is pushing heroin... She was the cover. Ruston put her at seascape so he'd have a reason for going there. When he finished visiting with her, he was free to reach his contact man. Well, if the contact lives at seascape like you say how come ruston had the narcotics on him when he got killed? The contact man wasn't home that night. So ruston left with the heroin still in his pocket? When I stopped him, his one thought was to get rid of the evidence. If he hadn't panicked, he'd gotten an apology. Instead, he got a bullet. Well, man, you did it. Following the gun really wraps up the case for you, huh? [Cody shoveling] There's still the contact man, Walt. Yeah. That's gonna be tough. Maybe he does live at seascape, but so do a 100 other people. The guy I want wasn't home that night. His plane was delayed because of fog. What, me? Oh, you got to be kidding. Who'd make a better delivery boy, Walt? An unmarried, unattached pilot making regular visits to every major city on the pacific coast? Aw, come on, dad, enough's enough already. Yeah, enough's enough, Walt. You tried to kill me. You killed the nurse, enough is enough. I just want the satisfaction of taking you in. You're not bringin' anybody anywhere. From where I stand, old buddy, you're up the creek. In case you're thinkin' of gettin' away, somebody ought to tell you that's no paddle in your hand, it's just an old toy gun. It's a real gun, Walt. Oh? Then be my guest. Take the first shot. It's a real gun, Walt. Yeah, that's what I thought. Now, will the real Tom valens please drop dead? [Gun fires] [Screaming] This is unit 4-k-2. Request an ambulance and assistance. (Female dispatcher on radio) 4-k-2, 4-k-2, what is your location? Eternal rest pet cemetery, 120th and gardena. 4-k-2, Roger. All units in the vicinity, officer needs help. Eternal rest pet cemetery, 120th and gardena. Officer needs help. Officer needs help. All units in the vicinity, officer needs help. Eternal rest pet cemetery, 120th and gardena.
