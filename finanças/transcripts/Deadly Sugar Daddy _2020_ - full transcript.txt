My story begins when my best friend and I moved from arizona to los angeles. Going to la, you've gotta have big dreams. And we did.. Big dreams and no money. I can't believe you found this place. Right? If you stalk the internet long enough, you can find golds. Now I just need to figure out how I'll cover my half of the rent. You will. Look. That job you thought was perfect obviously wasn't 'cause they went belly up. Your actual perfect job is right around the corner here in la, not at home. I know. But if I stayed home I could live with my mom for free. And there's zack.. You're not having second thoughts, are you? No. I just miss him. No, I needed this. I needed a clean break. So you're ready to start using the swipetodate app? Not happening. That's weird. Then why do you already have a profile then? Are you kidding me? With that picture? 'that's the photo you chose? The sunset picture?' hey, I took that picture and it's perfect. 'thank you very much.' look, what I found in the closet at home. Z bear. Zack won this for me on our first date. And, yes, I left it at home on purpose. We wanted different things, mom. Okay, let's eat. It's on me. Take your free meals where you can get 'em, gals. 'oh, you don't have to ask me twice.' I second that. Thank you for everything. Ooh. They have lobster. On a teacher's salary, they have wings. You know it was a loud voice. - Hi, excuse me. - Oh, hi, yes. 'we'll have the side of the good artichokes before the meal.' 'um, and I think I'll have the skewers.' - making a connection, jolene? - Oh, please. Really, mom, him? - Oh, you think I'm too old? - Never. But him? I wanna meet. Refill time. 'since I am leaving tomorrow' I wanna talk about what you're gonna do. You're a writer, honey. It doesn't matter what your day job is. Make cappuccinos, serve waffles, drive an uber. Just get a pay-the-rent job so you can write, like your father. He wrote books. I want to blog. Then when you get settled in here find the biggest blog site in la and make them hire you. Nobody even knows I exist. You know your father wrote two amazing books that no one cared about until his third one became a success. So what, I should just write a blog for me? Who would read that? I would. And all my girls at power yoga. Getting a personal blog seen by a really big site is hard. - 'I know it, but... ' - 'oh.' 'here come lindsey looking triumphant.' he said I was smashing which is british for hot. Oh, and that uber-handsome man that was scoping you out said dinner was on him. So, I guess I will get the lobster. Okay, mom. You've still got it. - Hmm. - Yes, she does. - 'hey. Okay, every other day.' - 'bye.' if your father were here, he'd be so proud of you. He loved you in his own way, honey. I know. Remember, opportunity dances with those who already have their boogie shoes on. Okay. Go dance, girl. I believe in you. - I love you, mom. - I love you, too. - Bye, jolene. - Bye. Be good. Or don't. Come on, boogie shoes, let's cha-cha on out of here. "traffic school teacher wanted, bachelor's degree accepted." okay. How about a writing job? Oh, "technical writer for medical devices." "swerve blog, la's leading blog site. "life revealed by award-winning writers from around the world. Truth so raw." okay. Turns out, truth so raw is not so easy to put into words especially when you feel like you haven't experienced enough life to write about it. I mean, whoever heard of bloggers burn out before even posting their first blog. Hours spent trying to write something to make swerve hire me. And all I could come up with was... Truth so benial. But I still sent in a sample because I didn't move to the city of dreams not to follow my own. - Don't do that! Oh! - Sorry. You look spent. 'I've applied to jobs I hate' and sent a subpar sample to the perfect one. How was your day? Well, I was all ready to wow everyone in my psych class day one, but turns out there's a lot of ridiculously smart people out there. It's just first day jitters. Wow them tomorrow. Yeah. - Lindz, wait, let me.. - Trust. This app has a five star rating. So... Just pick one. - Baby steps. - Unh.. - Mm... Ting. - Mmh. - Oh! - Good choice. Oh. Look someday when you're a famous psychologist you can eat all the lobster you want. Hmm. Well, he's relentless. Pull off the band-aid. Tell him you're dating other people. 'you realize this is not how break-ups work, right?' - I just missed you. - Look, zack, I miss you too. - 'but... ' - then why did you have to go? We've been through this. You have your father's business in phoenix. And I... And you're an amazing writer you can be amazing from anywhere. - Are you still there? - Yeah. I just, I need time to figure things out. I love you. We could be figuring this out together. Zack, um, I need to do this for myself, okay? I just wanna see you. Maybe I can come out there? Look, I-I've to go, alright? Bye. Thank you. I take it zack isn't handling the breakup well? Nope. He'll get over it. It's what you want, isn't it? I mean, I still love him but he wants to play it safe and if I'm gonna be a writer I need to expose myself to new things. Well, good thing you're gonna expose yourself to tim29 tomorrow. That is not what I meant. And don't you mean jaret22? Yeah. Names, numbers, whatever. Just get out there. New project. I have to analyze myself. Hopefully I'm not crazy. Brr. How was your day? Well, payment is due on my student loan and I don't have the money. You need a sugar daddy. I updated your profile pic on swipetodate. A hundred and sixty nine hits. I need hits from jobs. And? I got one. From hot valley traffic school. And I applied as a joke. Ooh, I have good news. Jaret22 can't wait to meet you. Okay, promise me, I go on this one date and you will leave me alone and delete the profile. I promise. Have you heard anything from swerve? Crickets. Man, if I were my dad, I would March into that office hand them my samples and demand a meeting. - Why can't you? - Absolutely not. I can't just barge into swerve. You absolutely can. Now, can you change into something slightly more presentable? Jaret22 awaits. You can borrow my new dress just don't look better than me in it. Hi, um, reservation under jaret garrison. Oh, mister garrison has not arrived yet. 'he's not gonna notice you unless you're waving' a ben franklin. Hey, she'll have a red wood, with an orange. How did you know that? I was at pour co the other night when you were there. I never forget a pretty face, or a drink. So you were the one crushing on my mother? Thanks for the drinks and dinner. Pleasure. Oh, I'm bridget. Bridget caprice. Anthony glonz. If I got my phd, I could be a professor like my mom, but.. ...Eight more years of school? I'd be in debt for the rest of my life. - Everyone's late in hollywood. - I guess if you say so. Bridget? I'm jaret garrison. No, you're three hours late. Sorry. Shoot day ran long. And about dinner, I grabbed a bite from catering. Drinks? Sure. Let me guess, moved here to become an actress saw I was a producer, figured maybe I'd hire you? Seriously? I'm a writer, actually. And the only thing I'd figure is that you would show up on time. Oh? Who do you write for? - Well, I-I'm between jobs... - No matter, you are gorgeous. You're unbelievable. Let's start over. You seem great. - I just don't do this often. - Yeah. Me either. Never, in fact, and you have just confirmed why. Why don't we have this conversation somewhere little quieter? How about my place? Come on. Are you kidding me? How about you try treating women with respect? My apologies for mankind. Make it up to you with a ride home? Yeah, sure, thank you. Promise me you're not some psycho-guy. If I was, I wouldn't admit it. I probably wouldn't either. - So where is home? - North hollywood. By pour co. Oh, best lobster I've ever had. I've only had the wings. You deserve the lobster. - This is you? - This is me. If that job at swerve doesn't work out, let me know. I'm in the market for a new executive assistant. It's easy, it pays well, and.. ...It will give you plenty of time to write. Thank you. I really appreciate it. Good. So, you're too good for everybody? Help! You're gonna regret blowing me off. - Argh! Get away! - 'wait.' - 'what are you doing?' - 'get in the car!' - Creepy enough for you? - Yeah. Sure. My best boogie shoes, what do you think? Ow! Swerve won't know what hit 'em. Listen.. - About the other night... - Don't bring it up! I still feel so horrible. I took down the profile and I reported him. Glad you had a knight in shining armor though. Two, in fact. Yeah, it was the strangest rescue ever. I'm just grateful they were there. Now you? - Go knock 'em dead. - Thanks. Hi, I'm bridget caprice, here for ms. Klein. - There's no appointment. - Ms. Klein will know me. I've emailed her. - Hmm. Yeah. - A bunch of times. I talk to my cat all the time doesn't mean he's gonna answer me back. Will you call her, please? I came here all the way from arizona. - Yeah, I have a bridget.. - Caprice. Caprice here to see kathy. Uh-huh. Okay. Up the stairs, third door to your right. You are lucky that I'm a sucker for well-researched flattery and tenacity. So, you did it. You got in. Now, why hire you? I read your english thesis, yes, all of it. Odd choice of a writing sample, but... It was good. - Thank you. - I'm not finished. - It wasn't you. - Excuse me? Our bloggers write about their lives and experiences like your father did. Lawrence caprice, right? I read his book in grad school. He exposed life in words so raw they bled off the page. He was a brilliant writer. But I'm trying to step out of his shadow. And it's hard. It's really hard. As kids all you wanna do is make your parents proud but what happens when your parents aren't around anymore? - What then? - That! - What? - See that, that was personal. You need to start a blog, write only things like that from the heart. People need to identify with you. Get traction in the blogosphere, then come back. Your father's success and tragic end gives your tale a strong start. Now continue to tell your story. Step out of the shadows, bridget. (jolene on phod on yourself, honey.' 'it's just one interview.' but it was the interview, mom. I'm telling you, I'm meant to work there. So, do what she said, write a blog. About what? A 22-year-old in los angeles who broke up with her perfect boyfriend and can't find a job? Well, I'd probably spice it up a little, but.. Yeah. You have lots to say. Just speak your truth. Thanks, mom. You're just starting, there are lucky breaks all around you. I love you. I'll talk to you soon. 'we were like, what is that?' and then I started, like, motioning. Like what it was on simon's pant.. It's amazing. "glonz corporation. Anthony j. Glonz, ceo." - what does he even do? - I don't know. But he can afford a really nice business card. I think you should just do it. You can always quit. Right? There are lucky breaks all around me. That's a jolene gem if I ever heard one. - I'm gonna texting him. - Good. - I did it. - Mh. I mean, what's the worst that can happen? I hang around a bunch of rich people until I figure out what I wanna blog about. - Sounds pretty good to me. - Right? - cheers. Ting - cheers. "9:00 a.M., my office, bring a double shot soy latte with sugar-free sweetener." face with tears of joy emoji. He uses ironic emoji's, can't be that bad. We'll just forgive his high maintenance coffee order. - 9:00 a.M., sharp. - That's what you said. In the ordinary business of life punctuality is... Absolutely necessary. Bertrand russell. So, um, what is the job? I mean, when do I start whatever the job is? It's mind numbing, really. Most of it takes place outside the office so I need someone young and energetic able to keep up with a busy and sometimes late schedule. And I'd like you to start immediately. Full disclosure, I know nothing about accounting. Also, numbers make me cranky. But words, I can do any and all things with. Only dates. You'll be my walking calendar. As you are with numbers, so am I with schedules. What exactly do you do, mr. Glonz? I perform valuations to quantify the potential for synergies in emerging markets. I help company x buy company y whether company y feels like selling or not. - Like a hostile takeover? - Not all takeovers are hostile. - Sounds lucrative. - Pay is $10,000 a month. - Yours? - Yours. You okay? You need some water? That's just, that's-that's, that's a lot more than I, uh.. It's worth it to me. The profit I stand to gain from streamlining my business and my social engagements far exceeds any perceived loss to you. I, uh, I can't believe that I'm saying this but can I try it out for a week or two? See how it goes and then decide? Of course. Reception has my schedule, and your first week's check. Sound good? I know krav maga so you'd better stay away! 'and I'm about to start screaming loud!' - Krav maga? Really? - Shut up. I don't know, it was the first thing that popped into my head. Could it be that guy from date night gone wrong? Maybe. I couldn't really see much. Okay, one, please wake me up the next time you're getting attacked. And two, that could make for a good blog on swerve. Check it out. - How's your blog coming? - It isn't. But how can I take time away from my job when the money is ridiculous? Hmm, yes, thank you for feeding miss poor grad student a lobster. Hey, anytime you want. I cannot even begin to grasp this pay grade. Don't knock it. You're adulting. I know I am. But this seems too good to be true. I mean, the job's almost too easy. I'm just a walking schedule keeper. - Boring. - Right? He even said most of the work takes place outside the office but I haven't left it yet, except for coffee orders. Hm. Hey, do you want to go to venice beach with me later? - Check out the boardwalk? - I can't. Someone has to pay for your lobster fund. Touche. Bye. I don't care how you do it, I expect results. 'what's on my schedule for tonight?' a dinner with a mr. Clemens at the cellar. Good choice. Do you wanna join me? Conversation with clemens is usually lacking. It'd be nice to have some real company. - Seriously? - Yes, seriously. - Sure. - Good. Oh, and, uh, tonight's a very important dinner meeting so get yourself a new dress. Nothing less than two thousand. Maybe some fancy work clothes. Do you need to sit down? No. I'm, I'm good. Lindz. I have something better than venice. Meet me at rodeo drive. We're going shopping. Just to be clear, when you die, I get that dress, right? He's early. Uh, hey, I.. You.. Wow. You look amazing. - I mean, yeah... - 'is that zack?' - have you been stalking her? - What? No. No. No. I.. Well, what are you doing here? You weren't returning my phone calls, so I got a little worried and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. - I'm-I'm fine. - Yeah, I, uh, I see that. - Why are you here? - Uh.. - I was in the neighborhood? - You're in arizona. You could have called. I tried, but.. Why are you dressed like that? I have a business dinner. - With who? - Anthony glonz. Zack, this is my boss. Mr. Anthony glonz. Mr. Glonz, this is my ex-boyfriend. Bridge, I really just wanted to talk to you. Okay, look, is it possible to have this discussion after dinner? Yes. I am so sorry. - You need to leave. - Bridget, just for a minute. Okay, how about I escort the gentlemen out while you... - Please. - Zack! - It's time to go. - Hey, I'll walk myself out. I'll meet you in a half. Shut, shut up. You come near bridget again, I'll kill you. Oh, don't. You will lose. Everything is compromise. Life is a compromise, relationships are a compromise. 'how so?' compromise is essential to all human relationships. Imagine if everyone went around demanding and giving ultimatums. - Nothing would get done. - I suppose. Think about it. Is there any relationship in your life that give and take wasn't involved? But what about staying true to yourself? Even to do that, you still have to allow room for adjustment. That is, if you want anything from other people. It just seems counter-intuitive to integrity. Mr. Glonz, compliments of the house. Thank you, remy. Dinner was excellent. - Drink? - Please. - Oh. - Ms. Caprice? No, thank you. May we live longer than our scotch. Here's to that. I can't let this moment go to waste. Come on, get closer. Portrait of an excellent evening, indeed. - Mr. Glonz, may I have a word? - Of course. Excuse us for just a moment. - What exactly am I doing here? - I don't understand. Well, I thought I was coming here as your guest but this guy's been pawing at me all night and you seem just fine with it. You have to be aware of the implications... Bridget, this is how the social side of this business works. Businessmen tend to let their guard down around women. Especially beautiful ones. So, you're saying I'm a set piece? Exactly. Seriously? You're admitting that? Yes. I'd never lie to you. This town is all the show. And the going exchange rate for making me look good and making my clients feel good is ten grand a month. It's worth it, don't you think? Exactly how "good" am I supposed to make these clients feel, mr. Glonz? There's no need to compromise your integrity. It's a magic show. Smoke and mirrors. 'you decide where your line is' I will respect that boundary and I'll make sure my associates do the same. 'it's your choice.' but I need you all in. This is just a job, bridget. Managed properly, you can earn a great living have time to write, control your own destiny. If it's not for you, I understand. But I need to know now. It's up to you. Oh, my god! This job, this game.. This is my blog. My last assistant was an actress. Took her months to find her way. You outdid her in one evening. - Impressive. - Thank you. Can I ask you what my.. ...Official job description is? Executive assistant. And unofficially? I'm not sure I follow. Are you a sugar daddy? That's, uh.. That's not at all what this is. Isn't it though? A sugar daddy keeps his "baby" comfortable and well looked after in exchange for certain services and unspoken agreements. So, am I a sugar baby? You are an executive assistant. Whatever definition you want to assign to that is yours alone. The only service I expect of you is to do your job. Do you have a problem with that? Just getting clarifying, and you clarified. Goodnight, ms. Caprice. Goodnight, mr. Glonz. Zack? If that's you, this is getting crazy. You need to stop this right now! - Hey. - Get inside! Lock the door! Lock the door! Lock the door! 'what? Come on. What's happening?' there's a man outside and-and... - Is it zack? - No, it's not zack. - What do we do? - I don't know. - Should we call the police? - I don't know. He was just like waiting for me to get home. Whoever it was, it looks like he's gone now. Are you okay? This night has been insane. - 'I'm sorry.' - 'you know what.' I'm gonna go funnel it all into my blog and let you read about it tomorrow. - Okay? - Are you sure you're okay? Yes, thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight. The definition of compromise is to settle a dispute by mutual concessions. In this sleek and secretive world I now find myself no man is satisfied by compromise. They want to win. And I'm their reward. Or rather, I pretend to be. Ms. Caprice, you know how much mr. Clemens likes to dance? Because that's the game my sugar daddy wants me to play. Well, then, I believe it's time to dance. I will learn to be his sugar baby and, sweet readers, I'm going to take you on this ride with me no matter where it leads. Compromise can also mean to weaken by accepting standards that are lower then desirable. But here's what I'm learning.. May you live as long as you want and never want as long as you live. 'cheers.' as long as you know what you want. Play it by your own rules. And don't mind a little risk. 'moments remembered.' then, sweet readers. You run the table. The game is yours. Another business dinner.. I thought I would learn something.. One thing I can say is that I'm acquiring quite.. I had to push my boundaries of what's comfortable tonight.. I keep thinking how far will go? Tonight's game was on a whole new playing field. And for the first time, I feel like I'm losing it. - You must be mr. Corkrin. - In the flesh. I'm bridget. - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. The problem with making your own rules is that not everyone is willing to play along. - Is mr. Glonz running late? - Oh, he didn't tell you? It's just you and me tonight. - Red or white? - Oh, no. I'm fine. I don't drink much, but I can suggest something? That would be excellent. Thank you. And after a while, compromise means being compromised. Becoming dangerously vulnerable. Exposing yourself to lure them in. I'm in a dance, sweet readers. And the music's getting faster. And I'm no longer certain who's leading and who's following. Shall we end with a lovely dessert? No, I'm fine. Thank you. But it has been a lovely night. Pleasure meeting you. Now, we've had a nice night. Good conversation. Good wine and food. I assumed we'd continue the evening back at my hotel. It has been a lovely evening. So let's not belittle each other by assuming anything. Assumptions can be dangerous, mr. Corkrin. I will not compromise on that. I will never cross that line. I had to get out of there. I was in danger. I was.. 'bridget!' zack? What? Did you follow me? You won't take my calls, or answer my texts. - I have to talk to you. - Did you drive here? - Yeah, my car's.. - Le-le-let's go. Let's go. I felt out of control. I needed to feel something familiar. Something safe. So, are you going to tell me who that guy was? Bridge.. A client. - Are you an escort? - What? No! Zack, you have got to stop this. This is getting into restraining order territory... Your boss is a felon. - What? - He's got a rap sheet, bridget. Embezzlement, offshore trading, trade commission stuff. What are you doing? Zack, I am trying to build a life for myself out here. Just because you are not getting what you want you want to try and blow that up for me? I'm trying to protect you. This guy, glonz, is shady. He threatened to kill me if I didn't stay away from you. I saw him, he was a gentleman. He carries a gun.. You're blowing this way out of proportion, zack. 'he was trying to protect me' and you and I are broken up. Maybe you should stay away. Just.. Just-just check him out, okay? And tell me I'm wrong. Whatever happens with us.. 'I love you, bridget.' I just want you safe. After tonight, that's all I wanted to feel safe. But this wasn't helping. Goodbye, zack. Mom? Honey. Where have you been? I'm sorry. This job has become more demanding than I thought. 'everything okay?' I'm just tired. Can I call you tomorrow and we can talk then? Sure, that's fine. Listen, I have a long weekend, I'll fly out. Great. Yeah, that-that's great. We'll have a lot to talk about. 'I'll look forward to it.' "night, sweetie.' for now, sweet readers, I don't have any answers. Let's just call this the end of a very long night. I know t whoa! Hm-hmm. Absolutely, man. I agree. We are in sugar daddy heaven. Be nice. You can't say that. 'ladies..' mr. Glonz, you remember my best friend. It's good to see you again, lindsey. You both look remarkable. When is the swimming portion of the evening? That pool looks amazing. I don't think there will be a swimming portion to this party, lindz. Well, the deputy mayor, chief of police and district attorney 'may like it.' there will be no swimming. 'lindsey, you're gonna get me fired.' I'm just warming up the crowd. Showing them how the other half lives. By the way, deputy mayor, district attorney 'chief of police?' 'that's a pretty pedigreed bunch for a criminal.' zack is delusional. I told you, the only thing I could find on glonz were a bunch of business filings. Unless it's a giant conspiracy. Okay, grad school is making you theorize too much. Give that big, beautiful brain of yours a rest for one night. Hey. Thanks for this. You can always be my plus one. And I can't believe this is your life now. Yeah. I still feel like I'm playing a dress up though. You do it well. 'and someone agrees with me.' bridget, he's gorgeous. Are we not talking about that? It is just business. I'm not sure he thinks so. Whatever the case, it's great writing material. - Let's snoop a little here. - What? I bet that's the master bedroom. 'dad.' 'lawrence caprice.' I thought of him when I met you because of the last name. 'do you know his work?' he's my father. 'you must be proud.' I can't say I'm surprised. You have a similar genius in you. Oh? And what is my genius? You don't know? Every situation you encounter, you find a a rhythm a nuance. A way in, and not only do you adapt but you flourish. It's like watching music be composed. You are brimming with untapped potential, bridget. That's why I chose you. Your beauty paired with the same wit and intelligence that shone through your father's prose it's... It's a heady combination. Thank you, mr. Glonz. Anthony. Anthony. Lindsey. She can't be left alone. So.. Can't she? I should probably go check on her. Lindz.. Could I get your help with something? - Yeah. Sure. Excuse me. - I'll be here. You realize he was about to invite me to brazil, right? Why did you leave me alone in there? Because you were having a moment. And somehow, you totally don't see that he's into you. Yeah, well, it got really awkward in there. Why? Because you're developing feelings for him? It's okay, bridge. I don't judge. I mean, come on, he's rich, powerful charming, happens to be very handsome. - Done? - Done. - No, thank you. - Good. Lindsey.. Yeah? 'what? What's wrong?' nothing. I.. 'I just thought I saw..' hey, could I borrow you a minute? There are some people I want you to meet. - Sure. Lindsey.. - Will be fine. I have deals pending with half the people here so I expect your undivided attention. Okay? I need you here with me, alright? Before friends, family and ex-boyfriends. Is that going to be a problem? No. Not at all. I, I understand. Good. Let's mingle, shall we? Mom! Wait. Where are your bags? I got a hotel by the airport. Dropped 'em already. - We could have picked you up. - I'm fine. I just wanted to freshen up a little. So, I can't wait to hear of what's been going on. Well, there have been a few developments. - Developments? - Mm-hmm. - What do you think? - We remodeled. 'this is nice.' so, you know the office job I got? It's become a bit more complicated. This super rich guy hired her as an executive assistant and it's bridget's job to make him look good 'in front of clients.' thanks. I was about to tell her my way. Your way would've taken forever, and I'm starving. So, how much is he paying you? $10,000 a month. $10,000? Mom! Bridget, what've you got yourself into? It's purely business. What kind of "business" exactly? I needed the money. And what exactly are you doing for ten thousand a month? Nothing that I would be ashamed of, mom. - What about your writing? - You should read her new.. - I am writing. - Writing what? A blog about a girl who works for a really rich guy 'who overpays her to entertain his business associates.' mom.. I'm going to take a car back. Mom, don't leave. Please. Dinner is on me. I'll pay my share. Mom! - Why are you doing this? - Ask yourself that. My blog is blowing up. Is it worth selling your soul for? I'm not selling my soul. I am actually in control. You're being used, bridge. It's dangerous. And if your father were alive... Just because you lived in dad's shadow doesn't mean that I have to. I'm tired from the early flight. I'm gonna get some rest at the hotel. Mom, mom, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that. - I have to get this. - Of course, you do. Mom.. Hello? No, it-it-it ended early. Of course. I will meet you there. - You came? Hm-hm. - 'you asked me to.' 'bridget, you look stunning.' I believe you've met my good friend, jim gallagher. District attorney. - Nice to see you again. - The pleasure is all mine. I'm glad we have some one on one time. Anthony speaks so highly of you. 'I know you've had a tough day' so don't think of this as a business meeting just a friendly drink. Will you excuse me for a moment? Please, bridget. I really need this deal. Lindsey? 'lindsey, help!' lindsey! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Okay, we'll be in touch. Here's my card. Call me if you need anything. We'll have patrol cars cruising the block but if you don't feel safe maybe you should stay somewhere else tonight. 'especially with that broken lock on the front door. Thank you, detective. Lindz, where could we possibly go tonight? I don't know. - 'oh, my god.' - zack. Are you kidding me? 'I've been trying to get a hold you. I'm..' 'I'm goin' home. I just came to say goodbye.' when I saw the cops out front I got a little worried. You okay? I'm okay. But someone broke in. While I was sleeping and attacked. Someone attacked you? 'come here. Come here.' who could be calling you right now? Your mom? No, she's probably still mad at me. - Hello? - 'bridget.' mr. Glonz. 'I just got a call from the chief of police' 'said there was an intruder at your home?' uh, yeah. 'but why would he call you?' you met him at the party, and he knows you work for me. He saw your name on the report and he let me know. Listen, I'm sending a car for you and lindsey. I want you two to come stay at my house tonight. 'or for as long as you need.' I have ample space. Oh, no, it's okay. We don't have to stay there, we can.. 'please, ms. Caprice. Don't be prideful.' I can protect you both and I would feel much better knowing you're safe. You guys can stay at my hotel with me. You, both of you, or I can stay here. 'bridget?' bridget.. He's your boss, not your dad. We'll be ready in 15 minutes. 'thank you, mr. Glonz.' I'm gonna go pack a bag. His last assistant, michaela newings she was found drowned a month ago. Did you know that? I mean, there is a ton of stuff on this guy. 'you just have to know where to look.' wait! Go back. That's him. Lindsey, come here! See? He's a criminal and it's not just white collar stuff. He's got assault charges. He's violent. No. Lindsey, this the guy that's been stalking me. Whoa, he's intense looking. 'is that your boss' friend or employee?' doe he have a.. Is there a name? No. And it doesn't matter. Everything about your boss is wrong. - Just let me take care you. - Stop. Zack. If that guy is really working for mr. Glonz then he's obviously security. No, this guy is a psychopath. 'and he's using you.' what do even know about him? I know that he can help keep lindsey and I safe tonight. Find something interesting? Blank expense reports. For? The dinners, the ubers, the clothing. Don't worry about those. I have accountants for that. I can imagine you have lots of people on your payroll. Yes. Thanks again for letting lindsey and I crash with you last night. Like I said, as long as you need. I think we're good. The police are gonna keep an eye on our place probably thanks to you. And lindsey said she can't focus on studying in paradise. So.. Can I ask you something? Of course, anything. Why were you taking pictures? It's just for my blog thing that I do. It's really no big deal. Hm. And what's this blog thing about? You, me, life. This job. The deals I do are private. Of course, and I-I never reveal anyone's identity. I have a very strict non-disclosure agreement with my clients. I never shoot places or faces, just objects. Give me your phone. I-it's just a personal blog. It's really just my story. My life is not some petty addition to your story. This is how you repay my faith in you? - Betrayal? - No. No, mr. Glonz. Um, anthony, no. I.. What? What? You wouldn't betray me? 'cause you did. You have. Who knows what you've already ruined. Beauty is dangerous. But beauty that doesn't know control that doesn't know its power is a liability that I cannot afford in my world. How can I make up for this? I-I-I can.. I'll erase the blog. Erase the photos, destroy the phone. What? I need to know that you are in absolute and complete control of your actions. But it.. I have personal, irreplaceable photos. Do you want to keep this job? I'm sorry. I never should have done a blog. I mean, I should have asked you. I never meant to upset you. 'this job is everything to me.' I really appreciate everything you've done for me, anthony. I did not meant to disappoint you. They're gone. The photos are gone. And I'll, I'll take down the blog. Absolute and complete control. I was going to give you this anyway. But now, I guess, it's more of a, a apology instead. It's too generous. You were due for an upgrade. Look, I'm sorry if I seem severe, it's just the clients I work with are very important people who expect complete privacy. If that were to be compromised, it would ruin me. And you. Of course. I didn't mean to scare you. Let me make it up to you. Why don't you join me for dinner tonight? Who are we meeting? You. 'I'm about to call a ride.' 'you want me to take anything home for you?' I'm good. 'you've reached zack, you know what to do.' hey, it's me. Look, I am sorry for kicking you out last night. I was just freaked out, you know. - But I'm good now... - Hi, zack. Lindsey says hi and lindsey says bye. Listen, if you found out anything else about the guy in the photo, let me know. 'okay, bye. And thank you.' boyfriend's gonna be a problem. 'I'm on it, boss.' hot date with your sugar daddy and his friends? Not really. You're having dinner just with anthony? How'd you know? That looks like a just anthony kinda dress. 'okay, yeah, but it's not a date.' it's just.. 'lindz, I like what I do.' and I'm really good at it. Making men feel good about themselves making them feel comfortable. Them trusting me. And anthony trusts me. Okay, what? Just, I've been thinking about about what zack said and he's a good guy, bridge. It's not like him to make stuff up. Stop worrying about me. I know what I'm doing. I promise I'm fine. Just be careful, okay? Okay. You can tell me all the juicy details later. I'll wait up. You.. You're coming back home tonight, aren't you? Maybe. Okay. Yeah, I-I'll meet you there, jolene. No, nothing about this situation is good. Yeah, no, I'm gonna, I'm gonna calling her right now. Okay. 'hi, this is bridget caprice, on my new phone' 'that I can't really work. Do your best. Thanks.' bridge, it's me. Look, the guy in the photo is listed as damon radovich but I can't find anything on him so I'm pretty sure it's a fake name. I also got more info on, uh, michaela newings glonz' old assistant, the one who drowned. This is getting really out of hand so I'm gonna head over to your place right now, but.. I, I'll just wait for you outside. Okay. Bye. So then he hefts me up out of the snow and skies down a double black diamond with me on his back. Lucky to have such great father. Occasionally great.. ...Always distant. He was severely injured when I was 12 and withdrew even more. And then he passed when I was 16. It was tough. What about your mom? Hmm. She saved me. She says I saved her, but I don't know. She's always been my rock. She's a beautiful lady. 'what's on your mind, ms. Caprice?' that night at the bar.. ...Did you buy us dinner because you liked my mom? No. It was you. It's always been you, bridget. More wine? Uh, no. Actually, I've probably had enough. Can I go check out your pool? My home is your home. Tempted to go all in? I am. My life is usually rather dull but you are.. I like you, ms. Caprice. More than I should. What am I doing? Anthony? 'I like what I do, lindz.' this is the best part. 'making men feel good.' - 'what is this?' - isn't it obvious? 'I'm really good at it.' I like what I do, lindz. 'making men feel good, about trusting me.' and I'm really good at it. - Anthony, what is this? - Security. It'd be a shame if this got into the wrong hands, wouldn't it? If this scandal were to ruin your name and career before words could take flight. But most importantly, what would mommy say? Zack said he would meet me here. - I'm sure he's on his way. - Two hours ago, lindsey. Something's wrong. Mother's intuition, I can feel it. What do you want to do? Do you know where this man lives? Anthony? Yeah. I was just there. Let's go get my daughter. It is an impressive editing job, if I say so myself. - It might even go viral. - Why would you do this? You know there are pictures that go with it as well. Of course, those serve a dual purpose. They tend to come in handy if a client balks on a deal. After all, no one wants their wife to see 'em with their mistress. But I never.. - You know I never... - Smoke and mirrors. It doesn't matter what is, it only matters what people think. 'you've reached zack, you know what to do.' 'zack, seriously, where are you?' I've tried zack ten times, nothing. Bridget isn't answering either. And the police, they won't help? No. They say, "just because she isn't answering doesn't make it a crime." - how much further? - 16 minutes. Step on it, girl. '...What I do, lindz, making men..' you have so much potential, bridget. Even more than michaela. Michaela, your last assistant? What happened to her? Her father was a world renowned economist. Girls with daddy issues are so much easier to mold. So uniquely intoxicating. I couldn't do it without you girls. But what happened to her, anthony? She was clever. So clever. But she couldn't abide by the rules. She also tried to leave. I had to let her go. You killed michaela? 'you're focusing on the negative, bridget.' it's-it's very unlike you. I understand that you're overwhelmed but we have a very long and exciting future ahead of us. What was it that you said in your blog? "having a sugar daddy gives me unrivaled opportunities." anthony, please, this is crazy. Is it? That first night I saw you at the restaurant I knew you were special. But then when I found out your last name was caprice? You were a daddy's girl. That was fate. And they way you handled yourself in business was remarkable. You were born for this. Do you know how most people define "sugar daddy," bridget? An old guy who blackmails young women? A older man who lavishes gifts on to a young woman in exchange for her company or sexual favors. But I never, never crossed the line, bridget. And I never will. Together, you and I are unstoppable. Titans will fall, businesses will fold. And I will grant you everything your heart desires as long as you remain my luckiest of my charms. I want no part of this. Of you. So, please, let me go. Oh, you are in way too deep for that. Hey. No one walks out on me. People know I'm here. They'll find you, and you'll go to jail. People? Who? Like my good friend the chief of police? Or maybe jim, my golf partner the district attorney, you remember him? No. No people are coming for you. There will be no cavalry to the rescue. I was hoping we could avoid this. Bring him out. I won't say anything about this, you know that, to anyone. Your friends and family know too much, 'cause of your damn blog. I'll tell them I got fired. No one will ever bother you. They're loose ends. Loose ends have to be managed. But I have arranged an incentive package, as it were.. - Oh, my god, zack! What did... - Hey, hey. Don't. Leave her alone! I swear, I'll kill you! Quiet down, zacky boy, let the grownups talk. You will agree to my terms, and help me run my empire. And until my faith in you is restored zack here will be held elsewhere. - You can't do this! - I can. Never underestimate a powerful man. - I want a raise. - Bridget, no... Shut up, zack, I'm trying to keep you alive. And secure a salary, commensurate with my skills. A raise? Considering the circumstances I think I'm being more than generous. Don't let a few pennies distract you from getting what you want. And what do I want, ms. Caprice? Absolute and complete control. - Stay here and call the police. - But I want to help. My mom and lindsey... Will remain alive as long as you comply. But just know, if you betray my faith I will send that video to your mother and she will die thinking her daughter is a whore. Keeping him alive is part of the deal, too. - Bridget, run. - 'zack!' there's nowhere to go, bridget. Call the police, lindsey. - '9-1-1.' - hello. 'I need to report a gunshot.' you can kid yourself that I am the bad guy 'but you felt that power, you spent my money' you seized that control and you loved it! 'I'm the one that taught that to you!' 'you should be thanking me!' - 'bridget!' - mom! Shh! Do you want her to die, bridget? Hi, mom, you look well. She's had a tough day, why don't you go hug your mother? - 'mom!' - shut up. Oh, my god. Mom, mom. Damon, is that you? 'oh, my god. Bridge, you okay?' lindsey. Oh, god. Mom, are you okay? Mom, wake up. Please, wake up, mp, mom. 'wake up. Mom, wake up. Are you okay?' please, wake up. Come on. Hurry, lindz. - Oh. Come on. - Hurry, lindz. - I'm losing my grip. - No, don't. - Hang on. - Just hold on. This is the end, bridget. Mom. Get a move on. - Hi. - Hey. Are you okay? Well, I really wanted to say something cool and heroic but damn this hurts. That's perfectly heroic. - Worth it. - Bye. So, when faced with stalking, kidnapping and certain death I felt like it was time for a career change. Also, compromise for the wrong reasons makes for a lonely soul. These days, I'm enjoying a simpler life. Broke, happy and safe. - There you are. - Thank you. - I love you. - I love you more. I'm living with the love of my life and thanks to you, sweet readers my blog went viral. And the job of my dreams is officially within my grasp. A sugar baby no more, simply... Bridget. And so, I introduce to you ...The bridget blog of the extraordinarily ordinary.. ...With some salacious fiction thrown in for spice. Welcome, readers.. ...Let's go.
