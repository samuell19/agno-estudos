Okay. Okay, oh. Office experience, which is great. Okay. So Emily, I do see that you have something on your permanent record. Is that right? Yeah. Yes, it is. Oh. We haven't run a background check. We don't usually do that. Could you fill us in on the details? Sure. I have DUI, like, a misdemeanor DUI. What happened exactly? I drove some friends home from a concert and I ran a red light. Everybody was fine, but- And you were intoxicated? I was less intoxicated than my friends, but yeah, that's what happened, so. Okay. So this is your official background check, which I have read and according to the state, you were convicted of aggravated assault in 2016. Is that correct? So, you do have all my information? Yeah, yeah. I'm afraid we do. Okay. Okay. Why would you- Well, if you want us to be generous with you, then you need to be generous with us and be honest. Okay? Okay. This is a very important job. You'd be handling private medical files. Right. Right. You're right. I'm sorry. Yeah. Let's start over, okay? Okay. Can you tell us what happened with the assault? No. No? No. Why would you trick somebody like that? Oh! I did not trick you. Yeah, you did. What I did is very common. That's a very common technique. Oh, is that right? So, you do that all the time? If people chose to be honest, then I wouldn't have to do that all the time. Well, you know what? Fuck this. I don't even want to work here. Emily, I'm sorry you're upset but- No, you're not. Calm down, please. I am calm. And you asked me why I want this job because I got $70,000 of student debt. There's your fucking answer right there. Yeah. You need to leave. Yeah, actually.

'Cause I know that we're hiring a graphic designer and we're always hiring assistants. Yeah, but I thought you didn't feel super comfortable doing that. No, I know.

Boretto. Benetto. This kid is really cool though. He acting like he don't give a shit. Man, he over here just. Who here has been a dummy shopper before? Raise your hands but only if you've done it. You did? Where? In L.A.? Nah, Milwaukee. Oh, Milwaukee. What'd you buy, snow shoes? Nah, like an iPad Mini. Two iPad Minis. Good. So for everybody else, listen up. In the next hour, you will make 200 cash, but you will have to do something illegal. You won't be in danger. You won't endanger another person, but you will be breaking the law. So if you're not cool with that, I get it, and you can go with any time. Can I keep going? - Yeah, that's what we want. - Uh huh. Good. Grab a card, please. In a few minutes you will go into a store and buy some merchandise. Any of these flat screens is okay. Just buy one and wheel it outside. We pick up the merchandise and we pay you. And that's it for today. These are stolen, right? The information on them is stolen. Yes. What? Nah, man. Fuck that. I can't fuck with y'all. Okay. Look, if you're not cool with this, great. Take off and don't bother calling the police. We haven't done anything illegal yet. They won't even show up. Okay? I'm cool with it. Wait, hold on. What's the problem? No, it's just, how do we know the cards work? You don't. That's the hard part, you have to trust me. What if they ask for a driver's license? Mm. Is that you? Let's make some fucking money. Yo! Are you gonna pay for that? I'm sorry? I said, are you gonna pay for that? I forgot. Sorry, man. Tomorrow you have the option to do another job. It's a little bit more complicated. We'll text you at 1:00 PM, okay? What do I have to do? Kill someone. Just kidding. We'll tell you tomorrow. All right. Wait. Don't you want to know how much you get paid for it? How much? 2,000. $2,000? We'll text you, yes? One o'clock. Sure. Right there. That's good. I got it. You text that number? Yeah? Yeah. For real? Hey, did you do another job for them, like, the next day? Nah, but I was curious though. I was definitely curious. Shit's broken or something. What's up? Want me to get it? Nah, I'm good. - You sure? - I'm good. God, damn it! I got you. - I'm not trying to get fired. - Not on my. Shh, chill. Are we supposed to eat this? Hey, what's going on? Hey. Oh, are you at work? Yeah, it's fine. Did you talk to your boss? Oh, I'll call you back. Sorry. No, no, it's good. It's cool. Okay. Well, so we just hired some people, apparently. My boss is being super weird right now and like- Did you really talk to her? What? Yeah. You think I'm lying? No. Oh, fuck. It's an hour away. So, I got to go now. What are you talking about? Wells Fargo is a half order, you don't need me. Nah, you can't ditch out in the middle of lunch. I'll throw you my delivery fee. Okay? That's 30 bucks right there. What? Am I driving your car? I'll take you back to the kitchen, you grab your car. Whoa! These are black cards. They don't have limit, no limit. And these, take these, okay? Just listen to me and you'll be fine. Do what I tell you to do. Go to the Southeast corner of the Plaza. You'll see a white door, they'll buzz you in. If you don't know Southeast, use your phone. It's just you. Okay? Okay. With a purchase of this size, the bank will call the vendor, but that takes eight minutes. So once they run your card, you have eight minutes to leave. Eight minutes or they know it's fake. How do I know this is going to be safe? If you don't want to do it, don't do it. Okay? It's up to you. - Hey. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. Come inside. Please, come in. Okay, so you want to test drive it, huh? No, actually my boyfriend drove it yesterday, so I'm just here- Here to pick it up. Oh okay. Sit down. So, you don't want to see the car, huh? No. I don't need to. He, like I said, he drove it yesterday, so. It's a little unusual for someone to buy a car without seeing it. Mm. Okay. Let's do it. How do you want to pay for it? Do you have a cashier's check? Yes. I've got. Okay. And- And the rests of the card. Okay. Let me see your driver's license. Sure. Jennifer, huh? Jen. Okay. Just a moment. Takes a few seconds.

I am. How much is it? It's a little down payment. You make that much selling TVs? Sometimes TVs, sometimes other things as you know. How much can one person make if they did what you do? What I do? No, I was just wondering. I mean, I already did it twice. You could show me how to do it. Why? What's in it for me? I don't know, how about a free car? Here. Keep it. Now you have my number. Adios. Hey, I'm sorry about yesterday. All right? Did it go okay? Marco wants to talk to you. Hey. Yo, what happened yesterday? It was an emergency, okay? I'm really sorry. Why didn't you call?

No, you can't take me off the calendar with no warning, Marco. I'm sorry, are you an employer? No, you're an independent contractor. So quit talking like you got rights and go back to work. Oh my God, dude. We have rights. Just because we're not employees- Look, this isn't a union in house. Call your shop steward then. All right? You got a union shop steward, call them, if not go back to work. So I can give you numbers, but I can't make cards for you. I do not have the time. But it's easy. Watch. Here's the numbers. Here's the cards. Okay. Now, you scan the magnet. Now you try. Fucker. When you did it, it looked so easy. Okay, wait, wait. Look, look. Pull it hard like this. We sell to a couple of vendors. They keep us on payroll like salary, but you can sell online, Craigslist, whatever. Yeah, that's a bad idea, right? I mean, none of this is safe technically, but if you listen to exactly what they say, you'll be fine. Don't mess with ATMs. Okay? Don't meet customers at your home. And the most important thing, don't go to the same store more than once in a week. You'll be dealing with lots of cash. What do you use for protection? Pepper spray. No good. I got something for you. Whoa, what do you mean? What is that? This. If you make less than $5,000, keep it, you're done. Okay. And what if I make more? If you make more? Yeah.

So anyone can go in and make changes but realistically nobody does that. So I'm kind of in charge of keeping everything on point for about 50 employees, right? I think it's 55 now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Including assistance and everything like that. So basically it's going to be these six columns that you want to make sure that everything is correct. This last column is going to be the most important. And by Friday, everything needs to be pretty much set. So you're going to need- Now, you're gonna kill the interview. E-mail all the bosses, CC every Assistant, all that good stuff. Thank you so much, Sarah. Yeah, of course you. I'm gonna miss you. Oh, I know, I'm gonna miss you guys too. Hey, you want to get lunch?

Let's drive. Hey, you're bleeding. Here. There's some tissue in here. Drive the car. All right, fine. I'm fucking done. I'm done with Khalil. So, quit. Five months, five months! He hasn't paid me a thing. He's not paying you? And now Rahad calls and tells me he needs the down payment for the apartment. He needs it now, that there's a cash offer from a Chinese company. I tell Khalil, you know what he say? You know what he say? He says you work with Emily now. Why you come to me? So, look. Listen, tomorrow, first thing, I'm hitting the storage units then the office. I'm going to clean up all the cash that's there, then the bank account. We have a business account. I'm going to empty it as much as I can. Jesus. Are you in? Am I in? We're working together. Yeah, but that's like a whole other thing. Okay? I don't know if I could, I don't even know what you're talking about. Even if I do this alone, he's going to blame you. How much do you want? Oh my God. So you're just going to rob him? Yes. You take a cut. All your debts paid. You can travel. Get to a new place, whatever. But listen, if you're going to do this, you have to be in for real. For real. No. Stay here. No, I gotta go to an interview. Hi. Ah, there she is. Hey, it's so great to meet you. - Hi. - Thanks for coming in. Good to meet you too. Thanks for having me. Ooh, I like your accent. You're clearly not from the west coast. No, I am from New Jersey. Where? Bayonne Hoboken. Oh, nice. Yeah. Where'd you go to school? HBS. Junior Senior, Ninth and Clinton. Oh yeah. I know Junior Senior. So you're familiar with the company. I don't have to go through the whole sales pitch. So you left college before you finished? Yes. Why? I got a felony conviction. So why didn't you go to school afterwards or a community college? I wanted to, but you know, I had legal fees, and student loans, and living expenses. I had to take care of my grandmother, so I had to work. Okay. All right. So what we're looking for here is a design intern. Does that sound appealing to you? Definitely. Yeah. Good. Yeah. Sorry. Is that a, you say intern, is it a job or an internship? Well, all my assistants are interns. So is it, sorry. Is that a paid position? Not at first. The way it works is the first five or six months, you get to know the business and if you do a great job, then I'd love to discuss it with you. Right. Sorry. I'm just trying to wrap my head around that. So what are the hours? Regular hours. You do realize this is a very competitive position? Yeah, sure. I understand that. What I don't understand is how you feel so comfortable asking someone to work without pay. You know, when I was your age, they told me all I could be was a secretary. Okay. But secretaries get paid. That's not the point. Well, when you were my age, do you have $60,000 of debt? How about this? When I was your age, I was the only woman in a room full of men. But you had a job. Okay. You know- You were getting paid. Am I wrong? I don't have the time for this. Clearly you're a bit spoiled. Spoiled. Let me be frank with you. You don't belong here because you think everyone is out to get you. None of us are out to get you, especially me. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - I'm trying to help you. This was a fantastic, Liz.
