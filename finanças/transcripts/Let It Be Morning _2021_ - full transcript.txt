Hey. Come, follow me. Sami! How's it going, champ? -Hi, Abed. How are things in Jerusalem? Thank God, fine. Are you guys coming back? Where to? -Here. God willing, soon... Want to see the taxi? What taxi? I bought a taxi. Not just any taxi, something special I'm starting a transportation service. It's parked outside, come and see it. Now? I'll check it out later. -Okay. Congratulations, Sami! -Thank you. Abed bought a taxi, he thinks it'll help him get Naima back. Did you talk to your father about our house? No, not yet. But you already decided, no? Yes, I did. I'll talk to him. Come sit down, son. Amin just got a very good job at Teva. He's in charge of the entire northern region. Works directly under the CEO, Eli Meir. Eli Meir, nice. -Yes. They pay him 7,000 shekels a month. Net. You think that's a good salary for that kind of a job? That's just the basic salary. He also gets health insurance, directors insurance... Of course, same as Sami, health insurance, directors insurance... End-of-year bonus, phone. -Phone, car... Car. Gas? No. Hey, babe, how are you? No, I'm inside. Don't worry, everyone's outside. How's it going? I'm fine, yes. Yeah, it's nice, actually. You know how it is with us Arabs, a wedding lasts two weeks. Yes. Listen, I... I really miss you. I swear. Yes. I should be done here in about an hour, tops. Want me to come by? Then wait for me. Bye. How's it going? It's going good, thank God. Want to come down? Or can I get you something to eat? No, thanks. We're fine, thank you. Is this going to be your house? Yes. It's going to be a very nice house. Really. Ladies and gentleman, let's take a group picture with the bride and groom while a thousand white doves fly into the sky like the colors of the rainbow. We'd like to wish them well and congratulate them. Come out already. LET IT BE MORNING Finally... Did we have to stay until the end? What could I do, Mira, it was my brother's wedding. They drove me crazy. "How is Jerusalem?" "Are you making good money?" "Do you have directors insurance?" Unbelievable. Same story, every time. Mom... What's a "daffawi"? Where did you hear that? That's what Grandma called the man who's building our house. They're Palestinians, just like us. But it's a bad word, don't say it again. How's it going? -Hi. Listen, man, the road is closed right now. What do you mean, it's closed? There's an operation going on, there's no way through. So if you could please turn around. We live in Jerusalem. I understand, but right now there's no way through. Excuse me, bro, we have IDs and everything. Everything's okay. Fucking hell. -What's going on? I have a presentation tomorrow. What am I supposed to do now? Damn, this is all I need. I'll get fired for this. Everyone says it was the nicest wedding this village has ever seen, they especially loved the fish. Abu Subhi. Hold on a second, sweetie. What are you doing here? Nothing, just having a drink. I'll go upstairs in a minute. Is everything all right? There's a roadblock at the entrance to the village. Sami and Mira are back, they say there's a roadblock. Let's go. Listen, you guys go up and shower, I'll take care of Adam. Aziz, we're okay, go upstairs to your wife. No, no, it's not a problem. Go up and shower, get organized, and I'll watch him. Is everything all right? There's a roadblock, so I thought I'd help them till they get organized. Sure... Give me Adam, you go upstairs and shower. I'll make some tea. They opened the back road. Bye. You want a request form? Where am I gonna get one now? Will you pay me back? Who do you think you are? You think we're not citizens? Submit a request... What request are you talking about, sir? Show me your warrant. Who do you think you are talking to me that way? Calm down, Khamed. I don't want to calm down, Dad. It's our livelihood. "Get your hand off me"? No, I don't want to. No request, no passage. Just open the road already. Let us through. You want us to go home? What's your problem? You have no right to do this. -You have a nice day too, sir. Hey, commander! Eli Meir, you know him? He's the CEO of Teva in the northern region! He's also a colonel in the reserve command! You know what he'll do to you if he finds out that you won't let me through? He'll fuck your mother! Stop it, Amin. -Fuck him! Supply lines are backed up because of this asshole. Call headquarters, tell them that Amin el-Mahadi who works with Eli Meir is stuck at a roadblock. Call them! Why are you kneeling before this asshole? Let's break through! They won't touch you, you're citizens! Who the hell do they think they are? Stop it, Amin. -He can go to hell! Who does he think he is? Rise, Moon, up in the sky and lighten up Earth! We weren't born to be inferior, we were born to be free Come on! I went to the village council, there was a heated discussion. But I'm taking a moderate approach. In regards to what? The daffawis, what to do with them. I don't understand, who said it's because of them? We know, Mira. Do me a favor, you don't live here. By the way, Sami, I should've taken care of this long ago. Thank you, my beloved wife. Bless your hands. -My pleasure. Ever seen anyone as beautiful as your sister? Thank you. Sami, my son, go with Abu Ali, get some cement and sand. It's 10 pm, Dad, everything's closed. You're right. He fell asleep, finally. So? I'll talk to someone at work to get us out of here. How? What does it matter? I'll talk to them, and that's it. Just try not to fight with everyone. I'll talk to Zvika. He knows people, and he needs me. Zvika... Give me a break, Sami. Why do you say that? I don't know. I don't like him, I think he's a hypocrite and that he doesn't really care about you. You know what, Mira? Everyone in this village thinks I made it in life. You're the only one who's always so critical. Does your father know you smoke? The only thing he cares about is our house. Do you want to fuck? What? What else is there to do here? In your room, with the posters. It turns me on. You're kidding, right? Maybe. Excuse me. Excuse me. May I approach? May I? Do you know when this is going to end? I have no idea. Is it really all because of the illegal workers from the West Bank? It could be anything. Honestly, they just put me here. What are you reading? That's a good book. I wrote a paper on it when I studied at Hadasim in Jerusalem. At Hadasim? My brother went to Hadasim, Ofer Alter. Ofer Alter... Ofer Alter is your brother?! -Yes. Really? -Yes. He was a grade above me. No shit? -Yeah. Wow... So you must be Elad? Yes. Weren't you a champ in something? Chess... -That's right, chess! I remember how he used to always brag about his little brother. Say, do you have cellphone reception here? There is... beyond the screening. Any way I could make a quick call? I... I have to leave a message for my office in Jerusalem, I work at Alcom and there's no signal in the village. I don't know, bro... -I won't run away, my family's here. I didn't think you'd run away. Hold on, I'll check. Shit. If my commander would have seen that... Happens... -Yeah. Listen, I... I'll be here tomorrow night from 2AM - 6AM. Can you come back then? It's too crowded right now. I hope I can let you leave and make the call. Tomorrow night? -Yes. Thanks, Elad. Have a nice day. -Bye. Aziz. What are you doing? There's no signal. I don't know, nothing. I'm bored. You know... Let's begin. Where's Adam? Playing outside. He's not hungry. Nizar, go get him. Really, he's not hungry. I don't want him to miss this. It's important we stay united. Adam, come eat! I don't want to! Aren't you sitting in Sami's father's chair? Mira, I didn't know we had reserved seats. Leave it, Nabil. Don't answer her. It's because he blinks, right? -Huh? You disrespect him because he blinks. What are you talking about? All right. The council decided to turn in the daffawis. We're preparing a space in the school... So now you're Gamal Abdel Nasser? Exactly. He's working with the village council If you don't like it, go back to Jerusalem! Stop it. That's enough. No one is turning anyone in. If anyone tries, I will kill them. They are our brothers. A Palestinian with Israeli ID or without, what difference does it make? If this happened when I was young, we would've marched through the gate. They'd kill 2 or 3 of us, but we'd eventually open it. But today, there are no real men left in the village. They're all cowards. The women go running on the new promenade while the men cook in the kitchen. The lights went out, Zahara. Zahara! -One second, I'm coming. They turned off the electricity in the village. I'm coming. Open up! Open up! Dad, Mom, open up! I'm coming! -Open up! Don't worry, my son. Just a minute, Adam. Open up! The doors are locked! Mom, open up! Mom! Where's the spare key? -You had it. Wait, my son, don't be afraid. -Open up! You had it yesterday. -Adam, be patient. I didn't have it. -Open up, I'm stuck out here! If you don't mind, Abu Sami. What, Abu Ali? He's coming to open it for you. Can I help you? Mom! Don't be afraid, sweetie. Don't worry, we're right here. There we go. Mom, I got stuck outside. Don't be afraid, everything's okay. Come. God bless you. -Thank you. Come, Abu Ali. God bless you. So you're building, huh? Yes, building. What happened? Where are you going? I need some fresh air. I'm coming with. -No, you stay here. So you won't be alone. Aziz, go to your wife. -No, let me come with you. If I go up to her now, I might wake her and then she might want something... Do me a favor, let me go with you. Do you think Nabil's plan will work? Will they really turn in the daffawis? I don't know, Aziz, anything could happen in this village. I actually kind of like the lockdown. This lockdown can last forever for all I care. I mean it, Sami, I'm not like you. When it's over, I won't go back to my apartment in Jerusalem. I go back to customer service at Cellcom. It's a nightmare. All day long, "Hello, how can I help you?" "Glad I could help you, sir." You have your whole life ahead of you, Aziz, you just got married. Yes, they say this is the honeymoon stage. How about you? You got a mistress in Jerusalem? Are you nuts? What kind of a question is that? I don't know, I saw you texting the whole wedding... No, I was talking to my office. You wanna wake him up? No. Let's go, you said there's no screening up there. And if he wakes up and sees us? Cut the nonsense. Suck on this, bitch. Aziz, what are you doing? Put it back. Stop it, Aziz, put it back. Fuck. I'm his brother, I work at Cellcom in customer service. Can he come too? I just want to check my messages. Make it quick. Hi, this is Lina, leave a message after the beep. My wife, my love, I know you won't able to hear this and you're asleep now anyway, but I want you to know that I love you very, very, very much. Zvika? Hi, sorry for calling so late. It's Sami. Sami, Sami. I work for you. I manage the code development. I work with Yishai. Did you talk to them? They fired me. What? I don't come in for two days and they fire me. Wow. What's up, guys? The night is short. They had to bring in someone else to do the presentation. Come on! What's going on? Are we done yet? Can we leave? And what if we don't? -What? What if we don't? What if we just run? Sami. What would you do, shoot us? Huh? Here. Shoot me. Here. Shoot. Bro, I was trying to help you. No one here is your "bro." You're the worst of them. Good night. Sami. It was nice to see you like that, my big brother. Do you think pigeons really mate for life? I look at them every day. I don't see any order. It's just one big mess. Fly. Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Why aren't they flying? -Stop it, Mira. What's wrong with you? Do I disgust you? Tell me the truth. No. What kind of a question is that? I see how you look at me and I think I disgust you. Come on Mira, what's this about? Then why you have stopped touching me? Mira. You're over it? Mira, you see the situation we're in. The situation... It's not the situation, Sami. It started a long time ago. I see you, I see how you look at me. Son, go check if there are any canned goods in the other store. No potatoes? -We're all out. We're out of everything. Take what you can find. There are battery-operated Christmas lights, if you're interested. Why do I need battery-operated Christmas lights? I don't know, people buy them. Dad, I found some canned goods in the other store, but this man grabbed them from me. Excuse me. Stay here, Adam. My son says... Excuse me! Get out of my way, you dog. You're a thief, you know that? Khamed, come help your father. What's the problem? He called me a thief. No... I didn't mean it. He accidentally took from my son... Dad, does it hurt where he hit you? No, son. It was just a little punch. Why didn't you hit him back? No, sweetie. We don't hit back. Only stupid people fight. Get in the car! Get in! Get in and be quiet. Let's go. Get in. What are they doing to them? Come, Adam. Let's go this way. Give me your ID. Get in. Take them. -Let's go. Sami, get in, I'll take you! What do you want to listen to? Anything. I've got it all. Choose whatever you like. What does the boy like? I have classical music too. Mozart, Bach... She always pretends she doesn't hear me, but I know she's home. We're in trouble. What's your deal? You making noise again? No, Ashraf... It's not that loud. How are you, Sami? Riding around like a big shot? You know everything's closed. God willing, they'll open the road tomorrow and we'll figure it out. I gave you money. Either you pay me back or you give me the taxi. Don't worry, Ashraf, I'll work it out... I'll ask my family if they can help. Luckily you have a distinguished guest with you. I'll let you go. Don't keep me waiting. See you, Sami. Sami, you think this lockdown is really because of the daffawis? I have no idea. I heard from people who know that America is going to attack Iran, so Israel is locking down its Arab citizens, like a fifth column. Soon atom bombs will start flying. What can we do? Nothing but wait. If this doesn't end, I'll die. You know what? We could march to the gate together, 2 or 3 of us could get killed, but they'd open. But in this village we can't get two people together for backgammon. There's nothing we can do but wait. It's always good to see you, Sami. We missed you. Excuse me. They've started rounding up... your people... Us people? That's not what I meant. Never mind, come inside, we'll tell them you ran away. Why? They may want to turn you in to the Israelis. So? Abu Ali, seriously, you need to gather your things and come inside. I saw them rounding people up. Or you could run away, but we're wasting time. What's your job in Israel? Computers, right? Do you work on C++? Java? I took a night class in our village, but my dad drove me crazy. He always laughed at me, said nothing would come of it. And he was right. You think I care if it's your prison or theirs? Hand me the trowel, son. Let them come, they're welcome. When are you moving in here? You see? Everyone has their own prison. Tell your father he's wasting his money. Wash this, son. I don't want to go for a walk. You'd rather take an exam? Your class is taking an exam right now while you're having fun. And no one can even punish you for it. I don't want to! Look how beautiful it is here. Look. No. Want to fly the kite? Let's fly the kite. Adam, Dad doesn't even know how to fly a kite. I don't know how to fly a kite? I'm telling you he doesn't know. I don't know how to fly a kite? What do I get if I can fly it? I get to spank your butt? Come on. Watch. No, stay over there. We know there is man, there are monkeys, dogs, and amoeba. And we know they each evolved from one another. But just because the bible says that God created the trees first, and then the insects, and then finally, man, we don't doubt that order. But we could say something else. I think that God created man first, and the monkey evolved from man, and then finally, the amoeba, the strongest, smallest, and happiest creature in the world. This is undoubtedly preferable, in the current constellation, we must accept an expansive perception of the situation, that real-political perspective dictates we take a levelheaded action. Isn't it preferable that you shut up already? God, what did I do wrong to have my daughter marry such an idiot? Come eat. The fridge is out. We have to finish the food before it spoils. Is everything okay with Mira? She spends a lot of time in the room. We're not in a good place. I hope this whole situation will be over soon. It's not that. I'm seeing another woman and she can feel it. A woman from where? Where I used to work. A Jew? -Yes. Time passes by, and Mira likes to stay home. So I'd go out with everyone, and then it happened. How was it? -With who? The mistress? Amazing. Why didn't you leave? Or would you rather live like me and your father? Living without love? Come here. No one comes near here! We're rounding them up, for everyone's sake. For no one's sake. Shut up! Come on! -Calm down, sir. Get outta here! -Put the stick down, let's talk... There's nothing to talk about with these thugs! Abu Sami. Thank you, Abu Sami. If you could pay us now, we'll be on our way. Thank you. God bless you. Sami. Good morning. -What, Abed? Meet my friends. Ibrahim and Yusef, my friends from the gym. Nice to meet you, guys. -Hi. I told them about your plan and they're in. God willing. You know, marching to the gate. It wasn't a plan, it was a metaphor. Metaphor, shmetaphor! You said we can't get two people together for backgammon. Here, I brought you two people. God willing. Sorry, guys, I misled you. There is no protest. Abed, you got me wrong. Die. Die. Die. Lina? Is everything okay? We're out of disinfectant. What is "multi-purpose" supposed to mean? What is "multi-purpose" anyway? I miss my parents' home. My mother had disinfectant for each and every thing. Disinfectant for the floor. Disinfectant for the tables. Disinfectant for the laundry. For the windows. For the mirrors. For the sink. She even had disinfectant for the body. Lina, the lockdown will soon be over and everything will be okay. It'll never be over. We'll never free ourselves from the filth. And from the eternal stench. There's no water. Damn it! We're dying here! We're dying here! We're dying here! Die already! Put your hands in mine until we vanish Put your hands in mine until we vanish And we shall flee to a faraway land And we shall flee to a faraway land And we will live without shame Without masters to serve Far away from the army, before the carriages come Far away from the army, before the carriages come... Look. Soda. Water would've been enough, but he's pampering us with soda. Sami, look what the council gave to its employees. Do you know that you blink? No... I have dry eyes. No, you blink. That's why you only see a small part of reality. Abed! Come on, let's do something. I'm coming. Any other martyrs coming or am I the only one? Look, if everyone asks that, the march will never happen. Exactly, you ass! It'll never happen, because not everyone is stupid like you. Get out of here before I bust your head open! Well, this won't be easy, but we can't give up hope. Abed! What does he want now? Ashraf, I'm working on it. We're working on something big, the roads will open tomorrow and I'll be able to drive the taxi. Yeah, I heard you're working on something big... Do you have a permit for this big thing you're working on? Why do we need a permit? Listen to him. -I'm listening. You need a permit for everything around here. Do me a favor, talk some sense into him and forget this nonsense. Otherwise I'll have to knock some sense into him myself. Come, Sami. Join us for coffee. No need to bear a grudge. He doesn't even want the village to be opened. Now that he took charge. We're lucky he respects you, otherwise we'd be goners. When we were kids, I used to help him with his homework. Seriously, you think he respects you because of that? He doesn't respect anyone like he respects you. We didn't really do homework, we watched porn movies. Then we'd hide behind the curtain, he'd pull down his pants and I'd play with his dick. Are you serious? You jerk, I thought you were serious. Where did that come from? Peace be upon you. -Upon you be peace. Where can I take you? Doesn't matter where, I just need to get out. Do me a favor, pass him the money. With the Udeh family and the Matar family, we're close to 100. If Taufik can convince his family, we'll be more. It's not everyone, but it's fine. Great. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Sami. How about we have a drink together? I have a bottle of wine, from my wedding. We'll sit and talk, not about protests or politics. It's nice to just talk. I wonder if she'll come tomorrow. You know... I slapped her once. I made a mistake. But I'm not a violent person. We were young, we got married... I was the jealous type, I went nuts. But it only happened one time. Enough, Abed, forget about her. Is she seeing someone else? That's not the issue here. You have to move on. I heard there's a new iPhone app where you press a button and a girl comes to you, shaking her ass. You're a good man, Sami. Even though you disappeared and stopped calling to catch up. People always said that you're arrogant and selfish. I always told them: No, Sami is a good person. I'm not a good person, Abed. I lie all the time. I can't stand my family. I cheat on my wife. And when you would call, I wouldn't pick up. Because I was ashamed of you. I'm not a good person. Regards from Ashraf! No! Why?! Now. Flap your wings like this and fly. Dad. We're teaching the pigeons to fly. Do you want to or should I? No, you. -Ready? One, two... It's flying! No, you're supposed to fly! Not fall! Oh no, Mom, the cat! -Shit! Adam, stop it, calm down. Let go of me! -That's enough. Let go of me! -That's enough. Calm down. -Let go of me! Let go of me! Fuck you! You pig. Poor Abed. Did you talk to him? -No. Mira, there's something I need to tell you. What? That you're having an affair? With someone from work? In Jerusalem? And that's why you always come home so late? And that's why you're always busy texting? Keren, right? I'm no fool, Sami. I see you. Why didn't you say anything? I was afraid... to lose our perfect home. Just like you. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry for what you did. Be sorry for what you didn't do. Next week I want us to go pick out tiles for your house. We've wasted too much time. Lockdown or not, I don't give a rat's ass. I want to build you a palace. I can't stand that my children are far from me. I want my grandson to play here and call me Grandpa. And in the evening, I want to sit down and talk with my son. And we'll go to IKEA. And I want you to consult me before you buy a car. And at night, we'll sit here under the tree and talk. You understand? Just like we're doing now. I understand, Dad. How is work? Work is good. They promoted me to manage the development department. The first Arab in management. And Mira? Mira becomes more beautiful day by day. Dad, did you know that Mira is a gracious woman? God bless you, son. Collaborators with the occupation are a disgrace! Collaborators with the occupation are a disgrace! Let's all yell, clear and loud, where is all the angry crowd? Let's all yell, clear and loud, where is all the angry crowd? Collaborators with the occupation are a disgrace! Collaborators with the occupation are a disgrace! There's the Matar family. Let's all yell, clear and loud, where is all the angry crowd? How do I look? You think she'll come too? Of course she'll come. And you look great, don't worry. How many people came? Almost fifty. Not enough to start a war, right? But not too shabby. The Udeh family is coming too. We've had enough of you! Friends, in the name of the council, please go home. This is an illegal protest. Look at that dog. Get outta here! -What's illegal here? Suddenly you care about what's legal and illegal? Who do you think you are? Friends, for your own safety, please go home and let the council continue negotiations regarding the daffawis. Let me remind you, we are Israeli Arabs. There are no negotiations. Liars! You love this situation! No one leave! No one leave! My homeland, my homeland, my homeland, you have my love and my heart My homeland, my homeland, my homeland, you have my love and my heart... So, Abed? You're a man now, huh? You're a man? Where's Naima? Why isn't she here? All these guys took her for a spin. Even Amjad was with her yesterday. You have my love... Amjad! How was last night? -Sweet. Did you hear that? Everyone knows about her. She even made him a bead necklace. Sweet. Go on, go home, boy. Go home! Go! Naima. Naima! I brought you our picture. I'm leaving it for you over here, on the wall. Anyway, I forgive you for everything you've done and haven't done. And I also came to tell you that I love you very much. And that you can forgive me too. You can forgive me too, it'll make you feel better. It'll make you feel better, if you forgive me. You'll feel better if you forgive me. Aziz. Aziz. Get up. Go to your wife. I can't. I need to keep an eye on the grenade. What grenade? The grenade. There are lots of weapons in the village. I spoke to some friends I told them I want to blow up the soldiers. Why? That's nonsense. I felt good holding the rifle. And anyway, if I go to her now, what will I do? What is there to do? Maybe she won't like it. Come with me. What about the grenade? -Bring it. Are you kidding? He'll kill us. You motherfuckers! I'm gonna kill you! I'm no man if I don't fuck your sisters! Fuck you, motherfuckers! Didn't I tell you it feels fucking amazing? I'm going up to her. Go to her. I want you to have sex with me. God have mercy on his soul. God have mercy on you, Abed. May he rest in peace. May he rest in peace.
