(MultiCom Jingle) - (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) (artillery whistles through the air) (explosion) (intense orchestral music) (explosions) - Come on you, guys, on your feet! Get the lead out, move forward! Get up, get up, come on, you sniveling babies! (artillery whistle) (explosion) (dire orchestral music) - Taylor? Corporal Taylor, get up, come on, come on, come on, get up! Get up, hey Hobie. Come on, come on, come on, you gotta get up. Heelum, come on Heelum, you gotta get up. Get up, you guys can't leave me alone! (screams) (quirky orchestral music) - [Soldier] (questions in a foreign language) - Fire. - Fire. (artillery whistle) (explosions) - Baker's out there, I'm going after him. - Riley! (explosions) - Medic! - That's Baker, Baker, it's Baker! - Here, here, he wanted Taylor. - Medic? Where's Taylor and the others? (choked breathing) Rogers! Take some men and get that observation post. It's 500 feet up, the ravine, the top, enclosed. The only thing between us, and that observe is this open gorge, here. The sooner we get that artillery off our back, the better chance we have of getting that ammo dump. - No chance for an airstrike? - No, no they can't pinpoint it. That's rough. - Huh? - That boy, Baker. - Yeah. - It's 0500, knock out that OP and hurry back. - Seven men. Milo, I want Martin and Donatelli. - Will do. (explosions in the distance) - Martin, Donatelli, Parker, Burroughs, Ackerman, Stanley, McCcord on the double! - All right, you heard him, let's move it! (explosion) - All right Charlie, we're all set. - [Charlie] You men, over here. We've got us a little kraut OP to knock out. You saw what happened to Baker. Taylor's men didn't make it, but we're going to. We've got to. That artillery has got us zeroed in. Now here's how it goes. We're here, we go over the top, down into this gorge, and we'll regroup there. Move low and spread out, and stay off the skyline. All right, no talking from now on and heads up. Let's shed these packs and get ready. - Let's get this stinkin' outfit to that ammo dump. (patriotic orchestral music) (explosions) - Give 'em hell, Milo, let's go, move it! (explosions) (intense orchestral music) Okay, go! Come on kid, come on, move it! (patriotic orchestral music) (explosions) Come on, let's move, on the double! Come on move! (explosions) Let's go! (patriotic orchestral music) (explosions) (forboding music) (stealthy music) - What's up? - Taylor bought it. - Where? - He tried a frontal assault. - It's too open for that. - We'll have to flank 'em. Milo, take the right, Donatelli, you're with him. - Right. - Parker, in the thrill spots, you keep 'em busy. - Will do. - Burroughs and Stanley, you come with me. Parker, drop back for rear guard. (somber and stealthy music) (forboding music) - [Soldier] (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) (stealthy music) (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) (explosion) - Atta boy, Riley! Let's get out of here! - They got it! - Way to go! (forboding music) - Way to go, Milo! (intense orchestral music) - You all right, Riley? - Yeah. - How about my boy Riley, huh? (cheering) - Hey, hey, here comes Parker. - There's a German patrol coming up the draw. There's about 20 of 'em. They didn't spot me, but they heard that bunker go up. - How far are they? - Oh, 450, 500 yards. - There's a small canyon behind that bunker. We'll wait there, circle, and go back to the lines the long way. Let's go! (patriotic orchestral music) (imposing orchestral music) (patriotic orchestral music) (gunshot) (imposing orchestral music) Martin, Parker, watch the hilltop there. Patrol might try to storm us. McCord, take a look over that way. Milo, Donatelli, try scouting that way, that canyon should be over there somewhere. (imposing orchestral music) (speaks in foreign language) (imposing orchestral music) Ackerman, McCord, take the point. (drum march music) (explosions) - Mines! Turn around. Slowly. Step by step. There. Now, we're only about 20 yards into this thing. We're going back the way we came in. Keep away from Ackerman and McCord, that's suicide. Sling your weapons and secure those hats. All right. Now do as I do. Dig slowly. Keep the blade flat. Martin, Donatelli, take your bayonets, and move to Rogers' position, slow and careful. Parker, Burroughs, follow me. (birds caw in the distance) Okay you guys, I think we're clear now. Parker move ahead of Milo. Okay Parker, you're clear, step up and come on in. Milo, you're clear, come on, come on in. Burroughs, where's Pat? - I found one. I found one. - Keep your head Burroughs, you'll make it. Now, back away. Steady kid, steady, okay, easy Pat. Now move to your left, slowly. - I can't, I can't. - It's okay Pat, it's okay. - It's okay. - You're okay, it's all right. - It's okay kid, take it easy, come on. - You're all right. - My god, will you look at this? (orchestral sting) (intense music) (patriotic orchestral music) (speaks in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) (jet engines far above) - They're ours! We got luck here to get em! (strafing gunfire) (explosions) (gunfire) (explosions) Parker! Come on, move! Come on! He's dead, Parker, we've gotta get out of here. Burroughs is dead, do you hear me? Dead! - Pat? - Now let's go! (sad and eerie orchestral music) - Move on, I'll follow. Okay, Milo? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Come on, come on, follow me. (speaks in a foreign language) - Hold up. - Donatelli, Parker, take a look! - Right. (birds chirping) - J.D. - Okay, okay. - Larry, up the tree, lookout! - Hey, here come them dames. (crying) - Donatelli, ask 'em to come here. - Right. - Let's find out where we are. - Teresa. (speaks in a foreign language) - Uh, the lieutenant. (speaks in a foreign language. - Speak any english? Ask her if she knows where we are. (speaks in a foreign language) - No. - Why were they prisoners? (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) - They were caught stealing food. - Did they do it? (speaks in a foreign language) - Yeah. (speaks in a foreign language) - Tell her it's all we've got. (speaks in a foreign language) - Thank you. - So you do speak English. - So? He speaks Italiano. - What's your name? - Teresa Ledavicio. - [Rogers] And the other one? - My sister Maria. - [Rogers] What are you doing here? - Looking for food. - Ask Maria to come here. - She doesn't speak English. - She'll be safer here- (yells in a foreign language) - Go ahead, Joe. (speaks in a foreign language) - Where's your husband? Maria, we're not going to hurt you. I've got to ask you a few questions. Come over here and sit a spell, we need your help. That's it. (gun cocks) (speaks in a foreign language) - Do you have any family? - No. - What about the old couple? Weren't they your folks? - Our parents were killed by the Germans. My son died from the pox. - Martin, take the lookout. - Right. - I thought those poor people back there were your folks for sure. - How about it? - It's clear so far. - The underground does their sabotage. The Germans took five people from each town. And when the underground refused to surrender the men who did it, they shot all of the hostages. My husband was killed at Sicily by the Americans. - Your parents weren't in the underground? - No. - Hey Roy, all clear! - Milo, you got a smoke on you? Them damn Germans took every last smoke I had. - J.D. - Well now, how come they missed this? - Thank you. Milo? - [Rogers] I think we better keep moving, let's go. - Lieutenant? There are some partisan fighters up in the mountains. - Where? - I don't know exactly. We were on our way to a doctor Romano's place when we were caught. He's with the underground and well, he helps people to join them. Whole families have been living up there. Well, I thought we'd be safer. Maybe they could lead us back to the line. - Yeah, well, at least we'd have a chance. Where is this doctors place? - No, no the Germans find us with you, they'll kill us. - Now wait a minute, that ain't very friendly. - Parker- - You Italians are supposed to be on our side now, you know. - Parker- - Well, why do you let her carry on like this? - Shut up, Parker, she's right! - She ain't right! - Take the lookout! - Charlie, can you give us directions? If you give us a head start, it'll be safer for you to travel at night anyway. - [Parker] Would you do that much? - We could use those directions. (speaks in a foreign language) - All right, all right, there is a creek there that runs up a (speaks in a foreign language) - Parallel. - Si, si, si, parallel to the main road, about a kilometer from us. - Well this is a creek bed. - No, no, no, no, no, there is a path that crosses the creek bed and there is a well on the path. - [Rogers] J.D., come on down. - Make up your mind. - We'll follow the creek bed in that direction. Stay close together. Make it low and quiet. Thank you, thank you Teresa, be careful. (maudlin music) - You! That ain't very friendly. Leaving us here alone. (speaks in a foreign language) (forbidding military style music) - Whoa! (far off engines) Big road, listen. - Something's coming. - Yeah. - Over there. (mysterious orchestral music) Milo, take a look. - Stay down. (imposing music) - German patrol coming up the road, follow me and move fast. (threatening orchestral music) (soldier whistles) All clear, let's go. (stealthy orchestral music) - Hey your sis, is she sick or what? - [Rogers] When did you eat last? - Two, three days, I don't know. Signore Milo's chocolate. - [Parker] These gal's ain't had nothing to eat in three days. (shushes) - What's that hum? - What are you talking about? - Shh, quiet! (humming in the distance) - We'll find out. - Hold on! These gals gotta have some food. - Well, Charlie, we ain't got any! - Time to take us with 'em, we'll be down there. - Right. - Milo, stop at the bargain on the way back! (mechanical humming) (stealthy music) - Sure hope they bring back some food. - Yeah, but I got a feeling Riley's gonna bring back a tank instead. - That's Milo, always the cop or the cowboy. He was always a cop and I was always a robber. Did you ever play that when you were a kid? - What? (gunshot noise) (laughs) - He was always a cowboy and I was always the Indian. Every time I got killed I'd get up and say "Hey, it's my turn now, Milo." (laughs) - I'll bet you a coke he brings back a couple of tanks. - You make that a roast beef dinner and you're on. (tension filled orchestral music) - [Soldier] (speaks in a foreign language) - It's hard to believe. What is this place, anyway? Some kind of factory or something? What are they making? - I don't know. - Well, we found our mystery noise. - Joe? I don't think they're making anything in this place. - What do you mean? - Storing. - You mean- - I mean there's nothing but krauts they're shoving down that hole. Some fuses, pro jobs, grenades, powder. - Riley, you and me found us our own special ammo dump. - Underneath... Its all underground. An elevator. Yeah. Joe, I think this is the dump our company was supposed to find. - Let's blow her. - What? - I said let's blow her. - Oh, Donatelli, you amaze me. You mean you and I- How? - Well, we go up there, see, and we ask one of them yo-yos for a grenade. He obliges and boom. - And what about food? You think we'd find any? - Don't worry about the food. Them guys gotta eat, don't they? Now do we or don't we? - We blow her. - You call it. - Sun's going down. We'll wait till dark. Still looks good we'll go in fast and light. - Okay. (humming stops) (crickets chirping) (soldiers speak in a foreign language) (stick scrapes against dirt) - What's that? (stick scrapes against dirt) (soldiers confer in a foreign language) (violent orchestral music) (engine hums loudly) - Easy, easy. Spread this around. Watch it. (engine hums loudly) - Look for the chow. - Right. Okay, got it. - Get the hell out of here. (massive explosion) Let's go! (explosions) - Hey, will you look at that! - Oh it's sure blown to pieces! (explosions) - Milo! Milo, what's going on back there? - What was it Milo? What was that? - Ammo dump. Joe and I blew it. - What do you mean, ammo dump? - He's got the chow. - Look, I think we better move out of here, because that blast is gonna bring out the fuehrer himself. - Milo- - Believe me Charlie, that ammo dump's all underground. It's gonna take 'em a while to figure out how it blew. The odds are in our favor. - They'll think it was an accident in there that caused it. - You know that sounds good, I bet that was the dump our outfit was supposed to knock off. - Hope you're right, Milo. (eerie orchestral music) (rooster crows) (gentle orchestral music) - Come on you sleeping beauties, the war is on. - Hey Roy, J.D. Milo, Milo the cow's eating all the- Donatelli, little sister. - Buongiorno. - Tell that Iowa farmer you're resting on to get up. - Iowa? I do not understand. - That's where we're from, Iowa. Farm state of the USA. Milo, Milo- - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (laughs) - [Donatelli] Riley boy, you sure were sleeping. What was your dream? - I don't know. - Listen now, all of you, I got news. We found the path. - What? - We're on it. - Then where's the well? - Must be here somewhere. I'm not sure which side of this creek it's on. We'll split up and have a look. Donatelli you stay here. Milo, you and J.D. check that side. Martin, come with me. - Right. (stealthy music) Anything? (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) - Hey, Pagliacci, why you laughing? (speaks in a foreign language) - You find it? - Mm-mm. (somber music) (laughs) - We found it, J.D.! (gunshots) Come on, let's move! (speaks in a foreign language) (imposing orchestral music) - Where's Joe? - There was two shots. (gunshots) (sad orchestral music) - Charlie and I were kids, we used to play a game. I'd shoot him and he'd die so good. And then he'd... This time he didn't get up. - Our father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses- - Joe, say it, you're it. - Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. - [Romano] (speaks in a foreign language) - No! Drop the rifle! - J.D. (speaks in a foreign language) - Throw it away Riley. (speaks in a foreign language) What's he saying now? - Stand up. - Doctor Romano, signor Gardino, a man from our town, he told us you could get us to the mountains, to the partizione. - Gardino's dead. - (Teresa) But we- - Who are they? - American soldiers, they were captured. - What's the problem? - Look, we can show you our dog tags- - J.D.! Let Teresa handle it. - You! Your mother's name? (speaks in a foreign language) - Leccione, Antonia Leccione. (speaks in a foreign language) - We were captured together by some German soldiers. These men escaped the same time we did. (speaks in a foreign language) - What were you doing behind enemy lines? - We weren't, we were on patrol to knock out an observation post. I mean, that's when we were cut off behind the lines. - There is only three of you. - The rest were killed. - [Romano] How did you escape? - There was an air raid exactly where we were. - You will come to my house. Hot pasta, a little soap and water, we'll grill you a goat. (laughs) - Here, try this one for size. - Well, thanks doc. - Hey doc, doc, this Giorgio can get us back to our lines? - Well, he did it before, but you may be better off just staying with him until your army pushes through. (domestic Italian music) (door opens) - Hey Joe. Okay, we're ready Joe. (sad music) How about it, Joe? - I'll give it a try. - J.D., take two of these. - I'll take one. - You take him with you to the wagon. Teresa, Maria, come on. Now, Joe and I are gonna hold back and back you up if you need it. - Doc'll take us through the kraut checkpoint with a wagon. Then we head north for Giorgio and the partisans. (rifle cocking) Come on, let's go. - [Soldier] Halt, achtung! (speaks in a foreign language) - All right you gals, run, run and don't stop! (women screaming) (explosion) (gunshots) - I'm going! - [Joe] Right! (gunshot) - Cover me, Joe! (intense orchestral music) (gunshots) - Where's Parker, Romano? - They're dead! - Morto. - Morto, morto. - The wagon, Teresa, the wagon. - Over there in the barn. - Now just keep a firm but relaxed hold on them. Don't hurry, just a nice walk. And don't get excited at the checkpoint. Anything goes wrong, Joe and I'll take care of it. Now good luck. Hey Joe, come on. - Right. - Okay, Teresa, let's get going. - Teresa (commands the horses in a foreign language) (spooky music) (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) - Milo! - Come on, you big kraut! - [Teresa] Milo! (intense orchestral music) (speaks in a foreign language) (gunshot) - It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. You sure it's safe to go on foot? - Can't keep going with the wagon, it's too slow. - But doc said to go north, just past the checkpoint. Which was is north? - That way, this Giorgio's up in the mountain. That's all we know. - The wagon's covered. - That'll hold 'em up for a while. (speaks in a foreign language) - Let's go. (adventurous music) (yelling in a foreign language) (Italian style orchestral music) (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) - No, no I can't. (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) Come on, we gotta keep moving. Come on, come on. (speaks in a foreign language) - We follow him. (tense orchestral music) (speaks in a foreign language) - Where's the other soldier? - He was killed. - We will talk later, you will rest in the cave. (speaks in a foreign language) (ominous orchestral music) (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) (forboding music) - How did you escape the Germans? (laughs) - Which ones? Hey, you've got quite a place here, Giorgio. - We get along. Right now I'm more interested in the Germans. - What do you mean? - I mean I'm curious as to how and where you escaped the Germans. - If you've got a couple of days, I'll tell you how we escaped the Germans. Every hour on the hour. - You led the Germans to the mouth of this cave. - What do you mean? - Perhaps you don't hear so good. A scout has just informed me a whole company of Germans is heading towards this canyon right now. - There was no other way. - No other way? - No. (speaks in a foreign language) - She's telling you that we just- - She's telling me how stupid you are! - Who the hell do you think you are? Have you got one idea what we been through in the last three days? Now I just lost six men, and you've got the guts to stand there and say that we're stupid! - Yes, even you, that makes you stupid! For six men and three days you will destroy what the German army could not in three years! - You're not fighting this war alone, paisano! We came 7,000 miles here to fight this war! - 7,000 miles is where you left your families! Our families are right here! And they came up this mountain the same way you did. Many people have died defending this cave. Now you are here, and the Germans are right behind you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah we're here, and we got women with us! So don't you stand there and tell us that we brought judgment day with us! - What else did you bring, eh? It's a good thing for you that the Germans are coming. - We'll talk about that later. - We'll see. - Judgment day, yeah? - Si. (speaks in a foreign language) - Giovanni, signor Giovanni, my number one man. He don't talk much. - I guess he never learned how. (speaks in a foreign language) - You will go now, prepare yourselves to fight. Help with your fellows, I must help mine. (speaks in a foreign language) (speaks in a foreign language) (imposing orchestral music) (speaks in a foreign language) - Why not here with us? - Too close to the cave. - Right. - Can you use a 30 caliber machine gun? - Yeah, yeah. - Good. You'll be with Giovanni. - Sidearm. - Eh? - For the women. (speaks in a foreign language) - Okay? In both hands. It's point and squeeze. (speaks in a foreign language) (tension filled orchestral music) (rifle cocks) (speaks in a foreign language) (gunshots) (yells in a foreign language) (gunfire) (intense orchestral music) (gunfire) (machine gunfire) (explosions) (intense orchestral music) (explosion) (speaks in a foreign language) (gunfire) (explosion) (gunshot) - Maria! (explosion) (machine gunfire) (yells in a foreign language) (yells in a foreign language) (gunfire recedes) - It's his arm. (speaks in a foreign language) - Where are the krauts? - They pulled back, hang on. (yells in a foreign language) - They're retreating, Riley, they're retreating. - I'll bet our boys are getting close. We gotta tag in, our thin skin are crumbling. Americani, moving in fast. - That looks done. Can you make it all right Riley? - Teresa and Maria. - I'll go find out. (speaks in a foreign language) - No, no. (crying) - Maria. Maria. (speaks in a foreign language) - Teresa? Teresa. (sad Italian music) - Judgment day, huh? - [Priest] Si. (patriotic orchestral music) (funereal music) (patriotic orchestral music) (MultiCom Jingle)
