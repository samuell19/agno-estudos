--== McEphie ==-- When we started living together, something changed. I discovered things about him that I didn't know before. He's extremely OC. Whereas she tends to procrastinate. There were unsaid expectations, things that he should be doing but doesn't. She sleep talks. But now he's used to it. -I'm used to it. -Before, he'd answer me when I did it. It's different when somebody depends on you. It's hard to go back to your old shape. She's like a python when she undresses. What I thought was a pillowcase turned out to be her panties. When we were still dating, we'd talk for hours on the phone. Now we don't do that. "Okay," that's all he says now. She only remembers me when there's a problem. Back then, his patience was unlimited. But when he turned 60, he became short-tempered. He changed. We're already retired. It's just us now, so we get on each other's nerves. When she's in a bad mood, I expect her to have the same scowl she has now. It makes my blood pressure rise. He's more hard-headed now. But also more loved by you now. That's my girl. You're still so beautiful. I hope Kyle and I also make it to 55 years. You might not even make it to your flight. Hurry! Start packing already. All right, I'm on it. She hasn't even started. Look at her. Happy anniversary, Grandma! I'm sorry, Grandma. A lot of mouths to feed. She can't be absent. You can't be absent for your flight! Where is Kyle? It's late! -He's never late, Mom. -He isn't. He has three minutes. Aren't you meeting at six? Cristy, you're just like this one. -Hey! -There he is. Hello! Hi! That boy is such an angel! Only at the beginning. Look at Grandpa and Grandma. You're still so sweet. -Of course! -Of course! Take care! We love you, Tin! Seems like our grandchild is ready to get married. Perhaps a double wedding with you? No! They haven't even been together a year. It's not about the length of the relationship but the strength of the bond. Exactly. Look at you two. Yes, exactly. -Okay, Mom. -All right. Paeng will pick you up tomorrow. Hold it! Dad! Dad, your meds. You thought you could get away with it? Okay, bye! -Good morning! -Later, okay? Please finish sewing Mr. Esguerra's orders soon. All right, ma'am. I will. When was the last time you talked to your husband? What is there to talk about? -A lot! -What? You haven't talked in a year. I'm not doing the talking first. It should be him. Pride. It's hopeless. You're better off separating. Just when Tin is coming home. She still doesn't know? -Not so fast. -What? -It has not been approved yet. -But it will be, sir. You're leaving us! We will lose the best boss in the world. And we will be having a hard time with Jethro Maniego. -Why did he get the promotion? -Oh my God. Nobody will be ordering him around anymore. Instead, he'll be giving the orders. But, sir, you'll miss the traffic here. Traffic might be bad there too. What about Filipino food? I can cook that. What about your wife, won't you miss her? You can't take her with you! Things have been problematic since the accident. Too bad. Just get a new wife there! Yeah, your current one is a snob. She didn't let you join us when-- -Hey! Not that! -Which wife again? Have you paid the electricity bill? I'll do it tomorrow before we go to the airport. We're leaving early. We'll make it. I'll set an alarm. The plane won't wait for us. You're not yet ready? Your daughter's ETA is 11:15. The airport's so close. It's only 15 minutes away. We still have to pay the bills before we go. Relax. We'll make it. That's what you always say, but then… I mess up? I didn't say anything. You might not have said it, but that's what your nagging implies. Well, if I don't remind you, you won't do it. I am doing it! You're just too advanced. And you're always delayed. Rick, are you trying to annoy me? Look, I'm taking pictures for potential buyers. This is me thinking in advance. Well… I hope that whatever money you make won't be wasted on another motorbike. I hope it goes towards things that we actually need. What if I need a new motorbike? When have motorbikes ever been a necessity? Maybe for an accident, yes. What? Are you giving me another lecture? -What? -The way you lecture me. You'd think I was one of your students. You're at home now. You're not the principal, and you're not my boss! No, I'm not. I'm your wife, so you should listen to me. -You should understand me! -Right! I'm your husband. Do you understand me? Do you listen to me? Yes! I listen to you! Even when you're not talking, I listen to you! And I try to understand even your silence. Why? When did you last talk to me? I mean, really talked to me. When? Let's end this. See? You still won't talk to me. Let's end this. I'm so tired of it all. We're better off on our own. What? We're separating? Their flight's delayed. Tin said we should go ahead. I'm okay if you're separated… from… my flight. I just have a request. Can we just wait… until after Mom and Dad's vow renewal? Can't we just pretend? For the sake of my family and… for the sake of Tin. When we get back, I'll give you what you want. We'll go our separate ways. There were so many times when we were about to separate. It felt like taking care of an eldest child. Immature! He was very immature. I was just naughty and mischievous. I told him, "I'm going to return you to your mom." You always say, "We can do it together!" But when the problem arises, financially or emotionally, you're not ready. It's tiring. You work endlessly, but there's no money. Your wedding ring is at the pawnshop. He went to Japan before. Our kids were still young. We lost all communication. There was nothing. No contact. …and all-around nanny to the kids. I saw the other woman riding with him on the motorbike, hands around his waist. I immediately grabbed her, and she fell off. And he was still trying to deny it all. My love for him turned into anger. I didn't want to get back together with him. No way. Why are you cheering? We live here. You missed Ormoc so much that it's left you speechless. Not talking. Are we? Not at all. It's just that it's so lovely now. It's surprising. A lot has improved since the last time we were here. Our mayor's really good at his job. Consider this. After typhoons Yolanda and Urduja, and even last year's earthquake, Ormoc continues to rise up. No matter how broken things are, they can always be fixed and made whole again. Not really. What? Not really… People here don't easily give up, right? They're fighters. Because here, they're all one family. -Right! -Just like our family! -Right! -We leave no one behind. You know my mother. Hold a sec. Big sis! Maybe they're resting. No, sis. -Maybe they're cuddling. -Stop it. Do you want to see them cuddling? Like when you were made? Yuck! You're disgusting! -I knew it. -Dad! You put this here, didn't you? Did you find me out? You didn't, did you? I didn't have a clue. And you! What if we had rebooked our flights to join you? Oh, you… Good afternoon, ma'am. He's tall. Taller than you. You're very welcome, dear. You let our daughter put you up to this? Mom, this was all Kyle's idea. This was your idea? Well, I just thought it was so cool… Because if you hadn't met on that day… No engagement. No wedding! No anniversary! Smooth. The kid is smooth. Come on. -Mom, Dad. Come on. -Yes? Where? How your love story began. My goodness, Tin. You know that already. I'm the only one who knows it. Not them. Come on. -Dad, you start. -We still don't know yet! Here's what happened. Okay, so… So, the shoe store closed. When we got outside, it started to rain. So we were stuck outside the store. And that's it, that's our story. That's it. That's all. It was pouring rain! Right, Tin? So, you said… "That's my shoe." "It's mine." "There are others there." "Fine. Look for something else, then." "But what if I want that one?" So, who won? Who else? -It was probably Cristy. -Dad! Of course, Dad's a gentleman. She got it from this one. You'll never win over this one. And then? -And then that's it. -Then… Then, the end. It was pouring rain! So, it was pouring. We waited until the rain stopped. But then her stomach started grumbling. -I was hungry. -Right. So, I said, "Want some?" I offered her this. So they shared. Dad gave Mom one piece. And Dad ate the other one. And then the rain stopped just in time. They had to go their separate ways. So, Dad asked, "Can I get your number?" And what did Mom say? I gave it to him. I wrote it down. Yeah, that's right! What did Mom write down, Dad? There was no number! That's what I wanted! Maybe she didn't have a phone. And now, Mom, after 25 years, what are your three words for Dad? Me? -Dad! -They're still young! -Not my baby, Dad! -Yeah! Sorry, Grandpa. Why not Mom and Dad, Grandpa? Come on! That's allowed. Yay! -A kiss. -What, Dad? That's how you kiss each other? Me? I'm 55 years married. And this is how I kiss. -Dad! -Hey! I love you to hurry and bring that there. -Well, you know what I mean. -I know. That's why I laughed. Cito! Leave it alone! It's heavy! This is so light. Let me carry it. So was the flower pot, and yet it gave you an attack. -That's enough! -Dad! -Let us take care of it. Rick. -Dad. -Let me. I got this, Dad. -It's okay, Dad. Let me take care of this. Dad, come on, don't get upset. -What happened here? -Give us a hand. Give me that. You're all games. I'm gonna chop your phone! Oh, the videos there are boring. Not all. So you can get one million views on your next video project. What video project? Why, Tin, you make videos for your label now? What are they, fashion shoots? I don't work there anymore, Mom. She didn't want to tell you yet because she's still on probation. She wanted to tell you once it was a done deal. It's at Buzzcut. -The Buzz! -With Boy Abunda! What is Buzzcut, Tin? It's just… Do you know how to do that, Tin? Tin, we're just so proud of you… I didn't even know you could produce videos. -Show us your work! -Yes, Grandpa. Put us in the video. We'd like that. -Don't let your guard down… -I'm excited about that. Now, I'll shut up. -Dad, here. -What's that? -Come on. -What are you doing to me? All these meds are going to cook my liver. -Dad, here's your new pill too. -I don't want to take them. I don't. You're a goner, Dad. Now there's three of them guarding you. Drink it now, Cito. You can do that. Go. Your rooms are ready! Your bed is in good condition. Ready for exercise. Are beds used for exercising? Why? Is your bed in Manila only for sleeping? -Ouch! -Your filthy mind! It'd be a shame to waste the bed Grandpa made for you. It's sturdy and-- Uncle Paeng! Stop it. I don't want to imagine it. -Stop talking! -What-- Exercise is important! Without exercise, you wouldn't be here. Not you, nor Potpot. This one was difficult. It gave me the cramps. Go over there. It's normal! We need exercise. Right, Rick? You're like this because you have no one to exercise with. Nobody is exercising! Nobody! Go to sleep. Get in. -Good night. -Go over here. -You, over there. -Dad, good night. -Okay? All right. -Good night, Tin. Where are you going? I just want to say good night. Okay, say, "Good night." Mom. Why? What's wrong? -There. -Good night. You exercise by yourself over there. -Ouch! -Stop it already. Good night, Tin. You guys exercise On that bed On the bed I'll sleep there. You might hit my knee. That healed a year ago. That's still your excuse? Let's just sleep. Why are you still up? I couldn't sleep. I also have three words. -No! -So, no! What? What do you want then? You don't want to? Then what? -Fire! -What's happening? Alongside Grandpa and Grandma's renewal of vows. Wait. Why so sudden? Why not? You don't want to? Tin, hold on. Because… Besides, Kyle and I are both here, and everything's ready for Grandma and Grandpa's vow renewal. With just a few adjustments, Kyle and I could have our wedding too. Dad. Tin. Actually, Cristy. Work and marriage are two entirely different things. And besides, they're of age. Did we stop you? No. Mom, if Grandpa and Grandma… then surely Kyle and I can too. Then why don't we just go all out? Let's celebrate your anniversary too! You can also renew your vows! Mom, hold your horses. Dad, there's a lot going on with your vow renewal already. Let's not add to it. There! Wonderful! So we can better guide them as they, too, marry. Our family is a true example of good marriages because no one has ever gotten separated. And that is my greatest treasure! That's why Grandma deserves the Outstanding Wife of Ormoc Award. Why don't we just tell them the truth? You're okay with disappointing them? It's better than renewing our vows only to separate after. Tin? Yes, Tin? Why are you still up? What is it? Could I sleep here tonight? I missed you two. We missed you too. That's why… Just the three of us. Before our family gets bigger. Look at our baby. Our baby wants to be babied before she starts having her own babies. …that forever is possible. -I'll bring the lemonade. -Let me! You're a guest. It's cool, bro! Potpot, lend him a hand. -Good morning. -Please let me. What was that, Mom? Is Dad sick again? Probably from too much exercise last night. No exercise happened. I thought I heard cows groaning in your room. Will you quit it! I made him rest. You're really disgusting. He just got too worked up over your arrival yesterday. He's not allowed to come down now. Grandma, that's one more thing Grandpa will complain about. He can complain all he wants, but if it's bad for him, he's not getting his way. Because a wife is not just the light of the home. We are also the cement that strengthens the marriage and unifies the family. Okay. Don't startle me like that. You're all grown up. My God, Tin! Good morning, Uncle Paeng. How about you? No more bridal lifts? No more "I love yous"? Too heavy now? I'll do it later. Looking at you, it's like I'm time-traveling. I see the past that can't wait to exercise, the present, that hardly gets any exercise, and the future that does nothing but exercise. No more magic? No more, Dad? Somebody interrupted us last night. Right? Guilty! That was me. Tonight, Mom's all yours. You promise? -That's a promise! -No more excuses. We're too old for that. We're not! I'll show you tonight. They're exercising tonight! -Auntie, let me get that. I'll help you. -I'm okay, dear. Dad, the magic's still there, right? Of course! What do you think? Why would you think that? Hey, baby. Come here. Tin. Rick, come on, you don't have to do this. Mom! You're such a killjoy. Enjoy it! You see, Tin, come on! We have so much to do. We still have to see the mayor and buy fabric, right? For your wedding dress. Just a quick bath, love. Hurry! Dad, come here. Your acting a while ago was really good. You almost had me fooled. I'm confused. You're the one who wanted a separation, just in case you forgot. I'll ask Rick. -Ouch! -Paeng. You heard nothing. And you won't say a thing. Let's not upset everyone else. We all came here for a happy occasion. I don't want to ruin that. You understand, don't you? Is it really over, Cristy? You agreed? You? It's what he wants. But is it what you want? -Oh! You're not yet ready? -Mom. We don't want to keep the mayor waiting. Where's Rick? I thought he was here. So did she. Go on and get dressed. -Your daughter had an idea, Cristy. -What is it? Actually, it's a good idea. So, what is it, Tin? But, Tin, everything's set already. We're just squeezing it in with the vow renewal. I know. You see? No. I don't want to delay the wedding. And besides, Mom, it would be too hot in an enclosed venue. Same at the beach. With our size, we'd look like whales at a beach wedding. Mom, don't worry, size won't be a problem. All you need is a tulle cape. I might look like a church statue. Well, you're a godsend. I almost believed it. I mean, your mom truly is heaven-sent. Who's getting married? -Afternoon, sir. -Pregnant? No! Not at all. Why the rush? Can you support each other and your future family? So, we can. You're settling in America? Anyway, do you plan on having children immediately? Eventually, sir. Oh my. Looks like you still have a lot to talk about. Mayor, when you were about to get married, you probably hadn't discussed everything yet either, right? Spot on. You're right. Love, what if we get silk organza instead? -That's it. -I thought you liked tulle. Do you want your bride to look like she's wearing curtains? Tin, you know, Kyle has a point. He does. -Where's the bridal dresses fabric area? -Over there. I'd still marry you. I don't want to look ugly in my wedding videos and pictures. Cristy, how about yours? What fabric was your wedding gown made of? Oh. Just blended silk. We just added some lace to match the climate. Too bad she tripped down the aisle. Yeah. It could work. -Okay! Good! -There! Go ahead, so we can have it cut. Hurry. Come on. Wait, this is also pretty! Maybe boho? Because it's windy. Isn't that more fitting? My God! Tin, it's a miracle that you decided so quickly that you would marry Kyle. -Go ahead. -Either will do, Mom. -Kyle. -Hi, Grandma. Kyle, let her be. -You know her. Let it pass. -All right. Come here, and let's sit there. Your dad has run off again. I just fell asleep, and now he's gone! Where is he now? -I have no idea. -Oh, Mom. Dad is missing. -There he is. -I'll do that. It's heavy. -Cito! You are so hard-headed! -Just go play. Let me. You're not supposed to be doing any lifting! -You shouldn't be carrying heavy things. -He can do it. RACHEL I FOUND AN APARTMENT So he and Rachel are getting a place together. At least you get to keep the house. Cristy! So they won't notice. Why are you crying? It hurts. I was shocked to find out… he's building a new life without me. I don't know what to do. Cristy. Didn't Grandma say that the woman is the cement that holds the family together? Now, it's up to you to break or to rebuild your family. Go be the cement! -Where's Dad? -Oh, Tin. Okay. Tin! What is it, my dear? You're looking for your father. When you and your dad say that… Because you keep saying, "It's okay." And then one day, I suddenly find out it's not okay. I know that I offended you. You see, Mom, if I need you, I will tell you. Oh, and you don't like that? At least you won't miss your mom when you get married. The problem is there might come a time when you don't know the difference. Mom-Kyle? Kyle-Mom? Dad! But you know what? Even though your mom is annoying sometimes, she has a point. What's even more annoying? She always has a point! But sometimes she overdoes it. You know what I do when she gets too much? I go away for a while, cool down. That's what I did. You were it before. You were my "break." But you went to New York, so… I found a new "wife." My motorcycle! Maybe just like your mom, Kyle is right too. If not, then don't marry him. Give him back to his parents. Dad, you're not helping. Come on. Be serious. Just like your mom. I could have returned her. Mom's so lucky to have you. At least the break never leads to a breakup. I already talked to Tin. She's okay now. She only listens to you. Maybe… I'm not the best person to talk to. I talk a lot, and I don't listen. Of course. You just beat me to it. I missed you. Me too. I hate it when we fight. Me too. Your medicine. That can wait. Your medicine first. Let's sleep. -Where are you? -Further back! -Where? -Rick! Here, Rick! Hey! Why are you back there? This is so far! I'm just being cautious. My warden might catch me and put me under house arrest. You know she's just looking out for you. That's why your 50th anniversary was canceled because of your heart attack. Now it's your 55th. Grandpa just had bad luck then. He was just gonna carry the pot. It was so tiny! You are one hell of an actor. I know that. You didn't have to strangle me. That's why, Dad, you should always be careful. I am careful. But, Rick, that's where we're all going anyway. Dad, don't talk like that. You're in charge of continuing this tradition. As I recall, when Tinay and I got married, my parents gave us a bed. When you and Cristy got married, I gave you a bed too. Same thing. And now, this is for my grandchild. But for my great-grandchild, you'll be the one to carry on the tradition. And the one for his great, great-grandchild, the one after that, and so on. Cristy? Onions not doing the trick anymore? Is that why you had to resort to smoke? I'm okay now. You seem very busy. It's like you're gearing up for battle. Cristy, what are you doing? I'm being the cement. What's for breakfast, Grandma? Your mom is preparing breakfast. Look, they've made up. If only others could do the same. Braised fish for Rick. Braised beef for Tin and Kyle. And also for Mom. -Good morning! -Cito, where have you been? Why do you look tired? Nowhere, I just exercised. This is bad for you. Potpot! -Tasteless. -It's as plain as plain rice. How much sugar for Rick? For Rick, just one sugar. -Just one. -No milk. And for Tin, it should be sweet. With milk. Come, let's eat. That's right. -I'm not participating. -Hey. You don't need to do that. I can handle this. Sit over there. Wait! Let me fix this first. Okay. -There. -Okay. -No, it's fine! -No. Just a bit. Hold on. There. Wait. -This happens only once. -Okay. -Okay. -Okay. There! You know, you should join them. -Go. -Right. Dad, you and Mom's turn. Okay. You should hug too! -Go, kiss! -Kiss on her cheeks! Okay! We all pretend in this world You smile even if it's not true Ouch! Oh, how it hurts There. Adjust it. Here. Wait a second. Let's try a different angle. -Is this still right? -Maybe hold me like this? That's it. -You ready? -Yup. -Sure? Okay. -Yes. Good. -Beautiful! -Okay. -Go, Tin. -Okay. All right. Ready. Maybe you should dress like that sometimes. Maybe that Rachel always dresses that way. I came prepared. Rick, you want some coconuts? Maybe you're thirsty? -Come here. -Why? Won't you be cold dressed like that? Cover up. We have enough coconuts. It's right here. -Cito, take your medicine. -Next! -Rick, your turn. -Come here. You're gonna measure that first? Have you forgotten its length? Mom's making a move! Aunt Cristy! Aunt Peachy is here. Hey, Tin! Aunt Peachy. Hello! When will it be Nicole's turn? She's single. She's too busy. I rarely get a call. Sounds like someone I know. When she returns to New York, she'll be too busy to call me too. Tin, do you still get to talk to Nicole? Not anymore, Mom. Can I sleep here? Tin might drop by unexpectedly. Because you know sudden movements are bad for my knee. That Paeng… He's like a jukebox. You're already doing it. Paeng! Will you stop it? Go to sleep. Forever exists. I did my best. I hope you get the message. They're here! -They're coming. -What's all this? -Oh, really. -Oh my God. What? -What is this all about? -You know what? I made this bed. For you two. So they can have their own bed. Grandpa, I can't believe how quickly you guys made this. -Yeah. -And how did you get away from… How else? He had accomplices! It's for Tin and Kyle anyway. We were just looking out for you. You might have another heart attack. My heart is strong. As strong as this bed. -You want to test it? -Let's go! It might collapse. That bed can carry all of us. This might land us in the hospital. You keep on moo-nitoring me. Are you a cow? -Come on, Grandma. -Oh, all right. But wait, Grandpa, there's six of us. Can it hold us? This bed can hold six, even eight of us. The bond between a husband and his wife is as strong as this bed. -Do you remember our story? -Yes. We started… Sit down, sweetheart. Right? -It used to be just us two. -Just us. And then our family started growing and growing and continued to grow until now. Grandpa! You're forgetful. You left us out. Where did these two come from? -All right. Come on. Join in. -Let's go! There. -Quickly! -Paeng, don't squeeze me in. Wait. Who's taking the picture? Where's the camera? -Yeah. -You're right. I'll do it. I'll make the sacrifice. -Okay. -All right. Son, take our picture. -What a jokester. -Come on. You're a mean father. I knew it! My God, Cito! You keep saying it's as strong as your heart. Now look what's happened. Did anyone get hurt? We're okay, Mom. All it needs is a little reinforcement. -Just-- -Never mind! Don't bother. Next time it's not just the bed that will break but also your heart. This bed might end up as your coffin. Oh, where are you going? To Boy's place. -Mom, aren't you going after him? -No need. He just needs some air. He'll be back soon. The women are taking so long. Your parents might end up waiting. All that's left is you. The project will start early. All right. I'll get back to you, okay? I'll check my schedule first. Okay. They're coming now. Her being spontaneous… …because it's so sudden. So what if it's sudden? Isn't that more exciting? -And action-packed. -Action-packed? Perhaps you-- -Hi, how are you? -Hello. Hello, sir. We know where Tin gets it! We're so alike, aren't we? Well, I also had to cancel a gig. Tanya, that was supposed to revive my career, but I'm here for my son. I said before that I'm going to take care of the expenses? We'll both take care of it. I can handle it. Actually, Tin, Kyle told me you recently changed jobs. So… money might be a bit tight? The way she talks, you'd think my wife is poor. Thankfully. There's just so much we have to do for the wedding. I don't know yet. Promise, I'll do all of it later. I'll do it later, Kyle. You think I can't do it. There are different flavors. Like chocolate, purple yam. So these are per flavor. Mom, let's try the cakes. Here, Auntie. Sorry, here you go. Just the office. Hi, Auntie. Good evening. See? Looks like the divorce came before the wedding. There's caramel, mango. Do you think we could add another layer? Your parents and grandparents already have cakes. It would be a waste for so few guests. Maybe one layer could just be fake. Tin, don't change the design anymore. It's fine as it is. Oh, it's Nicole on FaceTime. Hi, Nicole. Your godmother is here. -Hi, Aunt Cristy! -Hi, Nicole. How are you? Tin! Tin, it's Nicole. -Hold on. Tin is here. -Mom, I need to pee. Come on already. Come on. Tin's here. Wait a bit. I gotta go. I said it'll have to wait until after the wedding. But they're in a hurry, so a video call will do. What about Kyle? Or will you do a long-distance marriage first? You're changing jobs again, Tin? Excuse me, please. It doesn't look like they're gonna keep me. None of my videos have reached a million views yet. But you took it against me! You'll leave me in New York? I'll look for a job there again. It'll be okay even if my work visa expires since we'll already be married. I asked Nakshi for help, but she said-- That's the truth. That night, when you thanked me… I don't even know how I would've survived New York if I hadn't met you. If you hadn't loved me. If I hadn't been with you. I'm uncertain about a lot of things, but with you, I am certain. Your daughter's back. What? What? -Tin. -Dad. Tin, what happened? Tin! Mom, if you're just gonna scold me-- Tin, no. I'm not gonna scold you. What happened? Because whenever I asked you how you were at work, you would tell me you were doing great. Why are you changing jobs again? That's why I don't understand. Why did you suddenly change jobs? Even so! You know, if you keep switching jobs… I just didn't tell him because… Because… Why, Tin? You're so alike! You are exactly like him. It's so hard to tell you the truth. But you don't necessarily have to tell your mother everything. Even Dad, he's your husband, but he doesn't tell you everything. I get why it's difficult for Dad to tell you the truth. Cristina, that's enough. Dad, it's true, right? Oftentimes, you don't speak up. You don't say what you really feel. What you really think. Because Mom takes it differently. Knowing she doesn't back down from an argument, to keep yourselves from fighting, you just accept things as they are. Right, Dad? Tell her! You've turned my own daughter against me? -Mom, he didn't do anything! -I don't! I've had it with that damn phone! Rick, we've waited so long for this chance to go to Australia. You're not just talking ill of me to our child but also to your woman! Dad? Rachel is a headhunter. She's the one who found me a good job in Australia. What job? You have a job here! Why are you really going to Australia? I'm gonna work. Maybe that's why you wanted to get separated. I bet you've been wanting to leave me for ages! -Right? -I have no plans of leaving you. I didn't take the job in Australia because I was hoping we could still get back together. You're separated? -Since when? -Tin. So, all this time you've been pretending? -Mom. -We didn't want to hurt you. Then I find out that this whole time, you've both been lying too! So that nobody would say you made a mistake. That you messed up. I didn't realize that no matter how much love I've shown you, no matter how much I've served you, the only things you notice are my shortcomings. -My faults. -You're also like that, Mom. You only notice our mistakes and shortcomings. We might say things we'll regret. Exactly, Dad. We might regret it if we're not honest now. It's so hard being your child. It's so hard being your husband. It's difficult to love you. It's difficult to make you happy. I witnessed it. I know what Dad went through. Because every time I'd complain to him about how much you criticized, he'd still defend you. He'd tell me, "Let her. That's just how your mom expresses her disappointment." So much. That's why I prefer living in America. So that if I mess up or make a mistake, at least you can't reprimand me. You won't see my failures. If you only knew, Mom. I'm so afraid of failing. Because if I do, you'll love me less, the same way you did with Dad after his business went bankrupt. Rick? Is that what you think? No, it's not like that, Rick. Maybe you didn't love me less. But you lost your trust and respect for me. When the business went bankrupt, and I lost my job, didn't we agree? That I'd stay home and you'd work. Because you were the lucky one. You even had two jobs. We had loans to pay off. And we didn't want to send Tin to a public school. I thought that was okay with you. It was okay. I'm grateful, actually. Because you shouldered my responsibilities. I also did everything to ease your burden and resentment towards me. That's why I told myself… I'd be the one to cook. I'd do the laundry. I'd take care of Tin. And I wouldn't complain. I'd take all your anger because I was the one at fault. But even after I found a job and we lived more comfortably, you'd still find ways to bring up my mistakes. You'd always remind me of my failures. You'd rub in the fact that it was you who saved our family. So, now, that job in Australia and my motorcycle, I need those. So that I don't lose my trust in and respect for myself. All I saw was mine. My displeasure that we ended up in that situation. When I spoke to you, you'd only give short replies. You were mad like I was at fault for the loss of your business. Because you weren't like that with others. Especially with Tin. I'm so jealous because you two seem to have your own world. Because I felt that I should've been the one doing the things you did for Tin. I was sad and angry because I'd teach hundreds of kids every day, but I couldn't even teach my own child. Because when I got home, I'd be exhausted. I'd be dead tired. That's why I pushed you to find a job. Because I wanted to be a mother again to our child. …you had your own life already. You no longer needed a mother. And that hurt me so much. I thought we were a family. You're the only family. And me? But I understand. With the way I am, I guess… it is difficult to be my daughter, and it is difficult to be my husband. But I hope you also understand that… it's not easy being your mother, Tin. It's not easy being your wife, either. But if… what you need to be happy… is to be away from me, even if it hurts, and even if it's difficult… -Pot, who's that? -Yes? My father. He's going to look for Grandpa. -Why? -He didn't come home last night. Mom, what happened? Did Dad text you? Let him be. If he doesn't want to come home, then fine. I'm sick of always worrying about him when he doesn't even seem to care how I feel. He's on his own now. I'm done. So, what's going to happen, Grandma? You and Grandpa are separating too? If that's what he wants. Paeng, where's Cito? Dad… Mom is only concerned about you because she cares about you. Dad, that's 55 years. You've been through so much, and you're just gonna throw it away? You're just gonna leave? Who said I wasn't coming back? If I wanted to leave your mom, I would've done it a long time ago. She's always been like that. Then why'd you leave? Cristy, I'm only human. I have my limits. But what I always remember are our happy memories together. I don't go back to the sad memories, those bad things that happened. If I leave your mom, can I be sure… that my life will be better? That's possible. But would I be happy? But… when I'm with my family, I feel really happy! Especially when I'm with you, your mom, and Tin. I wouldn't trade you all for anything in the world. "You all." I'm part of "you all" too. Grandma, please eat first, even just a little. Your grandpa loves that. Where is that old man? Something might've happened to him. He hasn't taken his medicine yet. Grandma. I know that I'm not easy to be with. But I love your grandpa. Everything is going to be fine, Grandma. For sure. You're just like your mom. …when your grandfather and I fought. And I'd believe her. Maybe that's how it is once you're a parent. Even if you sometimes want to kill each other, you don't for the sake of your child. For your child, you'll stay together. For your child, you'll keep trying. For your child, you'll keep trying to fix it. If it weren't for your mom, we wouldn't have made it to 55 years. That's why I'm grateful for Cristy, and now you, for being here. I don't think I can ever do what Mom does, Grandma. Like today. I almost want to believe you when you say your grandpa and I can still fix things. It will be fixed. The children play a big part. I don't want to break their hearts. But I also couldn't handle seeing the whole family broken. I couldn't bear to see our children… Maybe that's why it's important to me that my family is complete. If you're only staying for the children, it won't be enough. Marriage is… You can't just love someone only at their best. You should also love them despite their worst qualities. His mistakes are mine too. If he's weak, I am weak too. Because we are one. You make up for the shortcomings of each other. She prepared breakfast. To make up for what I did, Mom. You supported me despite my constant mistakes. I wanted so bad to prove that I could make it without your help, that I failed to recognize your struggles with Dad. Had I not left for New York… To help you with your problems. Our problems are not yours to solve. And I now understand why you had to hide it from me. If it's too difficult and too painful to stay together, I will understand your decision. You're leaving? I hurt you. I know it's hard to believe me right now, but I'll still say it. …our paths will cross again. I'm just taking them to the airport. So, am I forgiven? We're still together? This is still sturdy. In ten years, it will be just as strong. Maybe even in 50 or 60 years. It can make it. If you still want. Want some? I'm sorry… that I stopped saying I love you. That I failed to make you feel my love. So beautiful. And I'll make sure to buy even the most expensive medicine just so we can live until we're 100 years old. Long live the newlyweds… Again! Hey! That's it? This is how you kiss! Come here. …that had to reach one million views. And that's none other than my family. When I meet God, I'll thank Him for giving me a partner in life. Once you've promised "I do," you can't take it back with an "I don't." What are your three words to forever? -The truth? -Yes. -For real? -Yes, the truth. -My three words? -You go first? Stay with me. Wow! -Aren't you gonna ask me? -I already know. I'm your karma. Wow, that's good. -Hold on tight. -We got this. My turn. -Got your paycheck? -Just withdrew it. We are forever. -I'm just here. -There is forever. Gary, Cecilia, and the kids. Him and us. Great. We're done.
