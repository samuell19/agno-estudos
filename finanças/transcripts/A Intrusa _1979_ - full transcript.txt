I like to see the prairie At the break of day Hearing the cries of the country In the song of the chaj? Uruguaiana (Brazil), Argentina border, Anxious to see the horizon I never looked for shelter Longing made me restless And the sheltering pampas And by counting things pampean I should warn everyone Good things, bad things Can now pass by Good things, bad things Can now pass by When I arrive at a dance Nilsen, look at these beautiful mares! - Saddle them! Godmother, the Nilsens have come! You can line up. May I... What luck, Dona Efigenia? Empty chairs. I don't like it! At Efigenia's house the clients' rights must be respected. Give the men their places. They're not ours, Dona Efigenia. We've just arrived. Just a moment! The only thing free here is good morning! Dona Efigenia, The hero is begging for affection too... Rooster. It's nothing, old friend. The time has come, old pal! The time has come! There is not a man who has been my partner, as you have... I'm very sorry, my friend. Thank you, Daniel Iberra. A man of courage neither goes on foot nor into a church. Pick an animal of your choice, Cristian. It's your right. Very well. Thank you... He chose well. Our boss said that for everything, the chestnut is best. The chestnut is yours. How much do I owe you? It's not for sale. The chestnut is yours. It's a gift. If it's not for sale, it remains yours. But I accept it on loan. Just until tomorrow. I seem to hear our father: Woman, gun and saddle horse, are not to be lent. And I'm hearing mine: See you later, friends.. And your pay? Don't you want it? I haven't finished the job. Have a good time. Just a moment... Are you taking the chestnut? - Buying it. Do you accept a man's word? Always. Benito! Knucklebones! The chestnut against your brother's horse... Done! Tails! Tails! Heads! Lost! Our ranch against the two horses. And don't mention it again. The pride of the Nilsen is worth more than a bet. The horses are yours. Tails! Heads! Congratulations. But I make a point of paying the job. And I make a point of completing my work. I'll stay until the branding is over. Then, brother, you leave alone. Watch the house. I'll return tomorrow or the day after. Eduardo. My brother. Juliana. THE INTRUDER Adaptation of the story "The Intruder" by Jorge Luis Borges. Juliana! Make some coffee. I think the business with the hides is going to come off. Then we can think of those fields that you like. I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan! Very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. 2 Kings, 1:26 Going far? That way you'll never get there. I bought these cattle very cheap, very cheap. Look who's arrived... Hi. Hi. A rum! And you, not drinking? No thanks. - Two rums. I'm not drinking. But I am. Nilsen, will that cock be as sly as the black one? It weighs 200 grams more. Why? Pay attention! There'll be a fight between Don Iberra's ill-bred cock and the cock Tajo Feo of Eduardo Nilsen. Hello, Nilsen! How are you? Your cock is asking for water, Eduardo! Cut it out, Benito. He's a Nilsen. Make an enemy of one, and you have two. How much did I bet? - Fifty. I'll pay a hundred! I already paid the bet. I paid double. - What? For the poor... Take it! Put that shit in the pot! Why did Cain kill Abel? Cristian, my brother. Would the lady accept a mat?? No thanks. I would rather have a glass of water. Juliana, there are visitors! Bring a glass of water. Juliana. Make some strong coffee! You can go! Are you coming? - Going. I'm going to a party at the Antunez house. A great party! Juliana stays. If you want you can have her. I'll be back tomorrow, early. Bye. Thank you. You can leave. Leave it, I'll do it. The mat? is still hot. How's things? Yesterday Don Tobias took more leather. Wear them. Well, now we'll sell everything. There's no time to lose. - Sell what? That's new! I didn't know... - You didn't know what? That the Nilsen are now in the business of raising horses. Raising no! To trade... It's dangerous. - Why? - They might find out! - Are they marked? - No! - Well then? What's happening, brother? Speak up... Would you prefer to listen? The woman is only for bed. But it seems that we like... Are you going to Uruguaiana? - It's on my way. Efigenia brought a fine looking girl from Banda Oriental. A beauty. Do you know her? I'm going to meet her. Leave it. You don't need to. Your girl is a beauty. Was she a virgin? I'll answer you back at the ruins, if you're a man. I'm going alone. Wait here. Keep out! Your life answers for his! Maybe you thought you'd find someone to have fun with. I hope I didn't disappoint you. It's nothing, Don Cristian. A flesh wound. But the boy lost a lot of blood. And Dona Efigenia insisted we bring him in the cart. I am Juan de los P?jaros, her servant. It is an honour for me. The fame of your name travels all down the border. People talk. My real name is Juan Cardoso. They say I like to prick the eyes of birds. Just inventions of the people. But I got the nickname. Come down. Come and have a mat? with us. Are you all right, brother? A little shaken. Also, Don Cristian, what a fight The boy didn't want to dodge the issue! He wanted to see death, face to face! Is there anyone home? Come in! Take a seat. How is your brother? - Fine, fine... almost well... Still in bed? - He's recovering. And your brother, how is he? I was sorry when I heard. He didn't lose his hand, did he? He lost his life. How? Gangrene. I understand. I'll be right back. - Good. It's Juan Iberra. - What's happened? It'll happen. - And Daniel? - Died. The one who goes is me. You're hurt, thank God. And you have one more death than your older brother. They are witnesses. I brought them to tell my people if I couldn't do it. What is it? - It's nothing. The blood is his. Now we're even, again. Are you tired, brother? No. Do you want to talk? I was expecting that. Collect all your clothes. All. Wrap everything up. It fell from the sky, once. I was in the field and I found it. Good! Glad to see you well, boy. Thanks, friend. Don Cristian... that business we're talking about? Wait, Don Juan, we will. With your permission... Of course. Dona Efigenia, we're selling the girl. Are you sick of her? - How much will you give us? How much do you want? - Five hundred. Are you crazy? Women like that I have for free... Four hundred. Three hundred. Done! Congratulations. - Why? He's free, brother. Man thing. A man who thinks for five minutes of a woman... he's not a man, he's a fag! Juan Iberra died That is common currency Dying is a habit That people possess Tomorrow the bullet will come And with the bullet oblivion Said the wise Merlin To die is to be born And yet it hurts Say goodbye to life That thing so mundane So sweet and so well known That thing so mundane So sweet and so well known Juan Iberra died That is common currency Dying is a habit That people possess I watch my hands in the morning I look at their veins With amazement I watch them As if they were strangers How much in your way These eyes will have seen Who knows what they will see After Christ judges me Who knows what they will see After Christ judges me Juan Iberra died That is common currency Dying is a habit That people possess Dying is a habit That people possess A drink for everyone! Long live those who remain alive! What's its price? - 150 a head... Damn it, man. I find your horses a little expensive. Expensive? If they were "ours" they'd cost twice as much! I like that! The steak is waiting. Come on? If it wants to be eaten, I want to eat. Come on. I've an appointment at the store. I'll give it a miss. - But... It's truco. I promised to play. I'm leaving, Don Juan. You can count on me another time. Tomorrow or the day after, at the latest, I'll be home. Simply inventions of the people! Simply inventions! Cristian. Cristian. I thought you were coming back from some dance. I spoke with Manuel Pardo about the leather business. Tomorrow I'm playing truco again at Quemada's store. Tomorrow? And Don Pires's rodeo? There'll be a lot of money. You go. I promised a truco rematch. Where are you going? - To run the mares in Colonel Saraiva's field. Well, good luck. - Thank you. Quiet. If we continue like this, we'll wear out the horses. It's better we have her where we can get at her. Come here. - Leave me. Well, Dona Efigenia... We have resolved... We'll take the girl with us. What? Paying, of course. She's a good earner. - It's none of our business. But now she's had a lot more practice. What's it to us? Tell me how much. Three hundred? Five hundred. You took your time, eh? - Time is for him who waits. We cheated. Give him dinner, woman! There are people who are hungry! Put more wood on the stove. It's not fit for a dog out! And go to your room. Don't bother us any more! South wind. I'm going for a ride. Take it away. I don't want any more. Leave it. I'll warm it up. And Cristian? He left? Was he there? Is there anyone there? Sorry if I've arrived without notice. I'm from Plano Alto. My name is Silverio Borja. I'm going to visit my godfather, Juan de los P?jaros. Can you give me lodgings for tonight? This is no place for a hill bastard! I didn't mean to offend. I just asked for lodgings. Go back to the mountains. Damn it man, he's crazy! That one? - A bum. He wanted to stay. You did good. This is our world. Thirty. What's up? Don't move. When I shout, jump. Now! What's up? Don Cristian. Good morning, girl. Hi. I come to invite you, Don Cristian. El Firmino wants to challenge you with his bay. Tell El Firmino another time. Excuse me, brother. Tell El Firmino that I accept the challenge! Who loses the race, loses the horse. Go make the mat?. I like it, Don Eduardo! The race will be only for us. My boss Colonel Bento said, whoever wins, will roast a calf. With a wine that comes from Argentina. Contraband always tastes sweeter. Bye! Something happen? Thank you. Come on. The black mare is younger. That's why she ran better. Nothing of the sort. The one from Corrientes is better. The first law of our house is to respect visitors. Take a horse of mine, Don Cristian. No, thank you, Colonel Bento. Thanks friend. Your horse ran very well, but my black was I think a present. He ran nicely. - Thank you. I'm ready for another, Nilsen. Whenever you want. It seems like rain. Tomorrow I'll see Juan and buy his bay mare. I told you your horse had no chance with Firmino's. Didn't I tell you? And the correntino, in the races, is a favourite. That's my bad luck. And the horse was mine. Mine! If I win or lose, it's mine. The problem is mine! The horse is yours, but the name Nilsen is mine too! So I dishonor my name? - Ours. Then we'll see whose it is! Prepare the food and stay in your room. Tomorrow, at sunrise... I'll go on your chestnut for Juan de los P?jaros's. OK... Don Juan's bay is a good horse. Morning, Cristian. How are you? Don Juan gave me a price. Good. We have to leave some hides at Manuel Pardo's house. I loaded the cart. We have to leave now, it's a long way. Is Pardo's ranch no longer to the south? To work, brother. After, the vultures will help us. I killed her today. Let her stay here with her clothes. That way she can't hurt anyone else. Now they were linked by yet another bond: The woman grievously sacrificed and the obligation to forget her. Jorge Luis Borges Subtitles: corvusalbus
