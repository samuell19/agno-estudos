Your Glasgow. Or to Valparaiso. Or Vancouver. Hmm. No. To Mestre. Addio! FAINT CHATTER "What is it that men have and women don't "and which is hard and long?" Everybody thought they knew the answer. But nobody said a word. It begins... ..in a bus... ..coming down from the mountains. "On your left, the city of Verona," said the bus driver over the loudspeaker system. "Verona was conquered by the Ostrogoths, "later by the Barbarians, later by the Austrians. "In the 14th century, the city was the setting "of the world-famous love story between Romeo and Juliet." "What is it that men have and women don't "which is hard and long?" "Tell us," said one of the boys in the bus. Military service. LAUGHTER The flatness of the countryside that the bus was crossing was unfamiliar to the men and women in it, and so it was difficult for them to judge distances. The coach was travelling fast, they'd come a very long way, but it seemed to them that the plain went on and on forever and ever. Looked out of the window. "Look, look! Look at that corn. "Look at their corn down here. "They're at least two months ahead of us." At last, at last... ..the coach crossed the causeway to the Queen of Cities. - Venezia! - Shh! Mia bella, bella Venezia. I didn't know you could drive to Venice. You could take your bike. Give you a ride whenever you want! Bet it's not 20,000 miles. They all got out of the bus and walked over the paving stones to the quayside and waited for the vaporetto. ENGINE THRUMS BELLS TINKLE On the boat the men stood very upright, almost as if on parade. If you left the village and you came to a city, you stood up straight. DISTANT CHATTER This was because the men were reminded of the first time they left their village, as conscripts in the army. Happiest times of my life, by far. Who wants to deal? The women lounged on the deck seats. And the younger ones pulled up their skirts to bare their legs to the sun. And the crowded vaporetto swayed first to one side, then to the other... ..like a woman pedalling very slowly on a bicycle. ENGINE THRUMS TINKLING "How would you like a white suit? "Would you like a white suit like the ship's captain? "Look, look at those insects!" WHINNYING "Where?" "There." "Ha, she's been drinking! "He must change his white suit every day. "He must change his white suit every day," I tell you. "Look, look along the waterline." "God, yes, thousands of them." "Hm. "They must come for the sun, they must do." "They're crabs!" "You don't know what to look at, you." "I tell you, they're crabs." "The whole place looks like a flood." "Anyway, you couldn't make cheese here." They got off the vaporetto at the Piazza San Marco and they walked into the huge square. Full of people, café tables, pigeons flying everywhere, dazzling sunlight. And they made their way, because the bus driver had told them to, to the campanile. The bus driver had said, "From the top of there, "if you climb up there, you can see the world." So they climbed up. The balcony was caged with wire. BOAT HOOTER BLARES After the campanile, the men were thirsty... ..and insisted on having a drink in one of the cafés... ..one of the cafés on the piazza, which Napoleon called "the largest ballroom in Europe". BELL RINGS "It costs more to piss here "than to drink a whole case at home!" said one of them. BOAT HOOTER BLARES Just beside the café, on a wall, our man, your man, noticed a poster announcing a festival and a dance organised by L'Unità, the Communist newspaper. "Why not?" he said to himself. His name is Bruno. Do you want to know what he looked like? He's wearing tartan shirt and a rather smart tweed jacket. He has dark eyes, with a touch of orange. - WOMAN: Look at his boots. - MAN: Real peasant, eh? - WOMAN: I like his beard. - MAN: Just like your hair. WOMAN: No. I like contrasts. I like the contrasts. He's better-looking than you. MAN SNORTS Look at him! He's a joke. His companions dragged him on into the Doge's Palace and they cross the Bridge of Sighs, where the condemned men went to the dungeons. And on the way back, in the Doge's courtyard, they stopped and looked up at the statue of Eve. "Hm-hm," one of the women said to him. "It's a wife like that you need. "It's a wife like that you need, Bruno." And then the men climbed up onto the terrace of the cathedral to look at the golden horses which were being repaired. Around these horses, people were circling all the time. And sometimes, for luck, somebody would touch with their hands one of the hooves of the horses. BELL CHIMES "Strange things happen down here," said Bruno to himself. HORSE WHINNIES And he remembered his father's mare that he, as a boy, used to feed in the stable. HORSE WHINNIES BELL CHIMES The festival he'd read about was to be held on the island of Giudecca. And from beside the horses, he looked across at the lagoon, and he could see the coloured flags decorating the buildings on the island. FAINT CHATTER And he thought he heard... MUSICAL NOTE ..he thought he even heard a strain of dance music coming across the water. BELL CHIMES The old saxophone player, who had been the artificial inseminator back home in the village, nudged Bruno and said, "I bet you noticed the stallions' balls!" Hey! Hey, hey, what kind of story is this? Oh, shut up! What's wrong with a horse's balls? If horses didn't have balls, there wouldn't be horses! MAN: I used to work horses when I was young. My father loved horses. I knew a headmaster once who stood on a horse for 40 years. He did! To cry the Langholm Fair. MAN: Stood on a horse for 40 years?! Come off it! WOMAN: Well, if she says so, it's true. And now they go down in the piazza. "Let's take photos." Click, click, click. "I'm going to take a photo of you, Bruno." Bruno posed. I've had it enlarged. Here it is. You can see Bruno standing in the foreground. But if you look very carefully down here... ..there is a woman... ..far away. Her name is Marietta. And she is the woman Bruno is going to meet. Hey! FLURRY OF WINGS SHUTTER CLICKS BRASS MUSIC "I'm off to the island now," said Bruno. "If you're not at the bus station "by two tomorrow morning, we'll know they've drowned you." "Hm! He's more adventurous than the rest of you men," said one of the ladies. As Bruno approached the vaporetto station, he heard a kind of music he'd never heard before. Bagpipe music. Hamish, he heard bagpipes. LOW-PITCHED NOTES Hamish! HE GROANS HE SIGHS HE HUMS TUNE LOW-PITCHED NOTES ROUSING FINALE LOW-PITCHED NOTES Bruno found an empty seat towards the stern and sat there. ENGINE THRUMS "You're not from here." These words were addressed to him by a young woman with magenta lipstick and white sandals. BOAT HOOTER BLARES "How's that?" he said. "You look too quiet." "You know what I have in this box?" She shook her head. She wore a red coat and her black hair was drawn back in a chignon. "A trombone." "It's not true!" she cried. "Then, play it. Please, play something." "Not here on the boat," he said. "Are you going to the festival on the island?" "Look, look," she said, "if you brought it with you, "you must have meant to play it." "We came from the mountains. "I didn't want to leave it in the bus. "I thought it better to bring it with me." Around her neck was a white necklace. Pearls. Pearls. I once met a guy who had his pockets full of pearls. He handed them out in handfuls. Perfect. Round. Milky. All licked looking. And you know what he said they were? A new kind of industrial ball bearing. Japanese invention. "Never wear out," he said. "They outlive steel and diamonds." "You could make them from North Sea oil." That's what he said. ENGINE THRUMS "You?" he asked. "You live down here?" "In Mestre, across the bay, "over there where the oil tanks are. "And you," she said, turning towards him, "I'd say you work on a farm." "How do you know?" NARRATOR SNIFFS "I can smell the cows." If she'd been a man, he would have hit her. "What do you think I smell of?" she asked. "Scent." "Correct. I work in a chemist's shop." "One look at your hands," he said, "told me you didn't work with them." BURST OF MUSIC "Do you know what my father calls that," she asked? "No." "Infantile proletarianism." He said nothing. "Perhaps," he thought, "it was a Venetian expression." And now the vaporetto was approaching the island, and he could see hanging from the first-storey windows of the houses on the far side of the piazza banderoles with slogans printed on them.

BRASS MUSIC ..he held his instrument case with the trombone inside it tightly under his arm. "The festival," he said to himself, "yes, it was organised by the Communist Party." But this didn't mean there were no thieves there, and he could spot some of them already. He was thirsty, so he drank at a fountain. She noticed the way he drank - with large gulps. BELL JANGLES "Do you like dancing?" she asked. "Can't dance carrying this." "Give it to me." And she disappeared with his instrument case into one of the nearby buildings. FAINT MUSIC He sat on a bench, looking across towards the Doge's Palace and he watched a gold-painted statue of a woman being unloaded from a barge. EXAGGERATED KISSES EXAGGERATED KISSES Venice! The goddess of love. Black, blonde and platinum. ♪ Platinum is the colour ♪ of my true love's hair. ♪ WOMAN: Oh, for God's sake. HE LAUGHS When she came back, empty-handed, he said to her, "And if it's stolen, my trombone?" "Comrade," she replied, "this is a workers' festival, "and workers don't steal from one another." BRASS MUSIC "Peasants do," he said. "What's your name?" she asked. "Bruno. And yours?" "Marietta." And now they walked along the quayside amongst all the people preparing for the festa, trying out the music or setting up loudspeakers. He had never seen people like this before. Yes, when there was a cattle market, everybody went to the cafés. When there was a dance in the village, everyone put on newly-ironed shirts. But this was different. There was no...work here. No work had to be done. Marietta suggested that they have a drink. He bought her white wine. CHATTER AND MUSIC She told him there was to be a two-man gondola race. Then the dancing would start. And over the loudspeaker music was already playing. BAND MUSIC: ♪ Alla riscossa Bandiera rossa! ♪ They looked around.

"What's it like on your mountain?" she asked. "There are rhodos and wild goats on my mountain." "Rhodos?" "Little bushes of flowers." "Pink?" "Blood red." "How do they vote in your village?" "DC." "And you?" "Hm. I vote for anyone "who promises to raise the price of milk." "That isn't good for the workers," she said. "Milk is all we have to sell." "You came here alone?" she asked him. "With the whole band." "A band of friends?" "No. The brass band of the village." And Bruno and Marietta went on dancing. "Let's sit," Marietta proposed. And she guided him to a table beneath a gigantic portrait on the other side of the piazza. The portrait was drawn on a huge white sheet hung from the top windows of the house, and the face painted on it was so large that even the flanks of the nose looked as if they'd been drawn with a six-inch house painter's brush. BRASS MUSIC Both of them glanced up at the portrait above them. Then she touched the hand of the trombone player from the village. "Do you live alone?" she asked. "Yes." TROMBONE MUSIC "I've lived alone for eight years, a fifth of my life. "Mother died. "Yes, she died in the month of September, eight years ago, "almost to the day." Marietta liked the way he hesitated before speaking. It was very deliberate, as if each time he answered one of her questions, he came to the door of a house, opened it to a visitor and then spoke. He poured out more wine for her. And for a while, both of them were silent, watching the card players. Every time you play a hand it's a new beginning. "How many mirrors do you have at home?" she asked, and she asked this as if it were a fortune-teller's riddle, and he...he paused to count. "One over the sink. "One over the drinking trough outside." And she laughed... ..and arranged the wrapped-up collar of his shirt. He glanced up at the huge white portrait above them. COW MOOS "That's Karl Marx, isn't it?" "Marx was a great prophet," she said. HENS CLUCK "What do you... What do you see in the future?" "The rich getting richer." "I mean, your future." "Mine? Ha! Everything depends on my health. "You don't look sick to me."

"I live alone." "You know, I think I could find you work here in Mestre," she said. And as she was saying this, he was looking at her small feet thinking, "Everything that happens between a man and a woman "is a question of how much you give up of one thing "to have another. "An exchange." BELL TINKLES "You... You," she said, "you are bound to be influenced "by the property of relations of which you are a part." And her voice, when she pronounced these strange words, was tender... ..as if she were explaining something intimate. "The kulaks," she said, "sided with the bourgeoisie, "and the little peasants with the petty bourgeoisie. "And that's why you're wrong "to think only about the price of milk." "She comes," he told himself, "from this place of water and islands, "where there is no earth at all." "And," she went on, "the fact is, "peasants will disappear. The future lies elsewhere." SHEEP BLEAT "I'd like to have children," he surprised himself by saying. "Then you have to find a wife." "You'd find a wife if you moved here," she said. "Ah. I'd cut off my right hand rather than work in a factory." "Workers have fixed hours and paid holidays," she said. "I have nobody on my back when I work. I can choose." "Are you sure you can choose?" she asked.

The lights were on. The long tables on which the people had eaten were cleared away. The first couples began to dance. And in the trees, loudspeakers were perched like owls. JAUNTY MUSIC "Do they caress well?" he asked. "Who?" "The weasels over there." "Perhaps. What a man does to a woman. "Let's dance," she said. The owl was hooting a tango. "Who's milking the cows tonight?" she whispered, as they danced. MUSIC CONTINUES "And who am I dancing with?" he said. "Marietta is dancing with Bruno. "Bruno is dancing with Marietta... "..who lives in Mestre," she said. MUSIC CONTINUES He pulled her arm up and, looking along their two arms, as if taking aim with a gun, he advanced, turned and, as the tempo increased, advanced and turned ever more quickly. People began to watch them. They were dancing then. His shirt and his heavy clothes made it clear he was from the country, but dancing, they made a couple.

Some of the bystanders who were watching Marietta and Bruno began to clap in time with the music. It was like watching a duel. A duel between the paving stones and their four feet. It went on and on and on. "How long could they keep it up like that?" the watchers asked themselves. And they went on longer than anyone expected. And at last, when they did stop, he took a red handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped the sweat off his forehead. Some youngsters called out for tutti-frutti. "Ha, the young," said Marietta, a little wistfully, as if she were no longer young. TING! MUSIC RESUMES Now they left the piazza and walked down a narrow street where there were old men sitting on wicker chairs and grandmothers playing with balloons to amuse their grandchildren. It was already night. And at the end of the street, lit up with electric lights, was suspended another gigantic portrait, a great domed head... ..like a great beehive of thought. He looked up at it. "That's Gramsci," she said. And he put his arm around her shoulders so that she could lean her head against his damp flannel shirt. Pushing her head a little against his shoulder, she said, "Antonio Gramsci." "Hm?" "He taught us all." "You wouldn't mistake him for a horse dealer," came the reply from Bruno. Once there were two woodcutters walking to work together. It was early morning. And on the path through the forest they spotted some lion shit. "What shall we do?" "Carry on and cut our wood," says the other. At nightfall, the first one says, "I'm not going back through the forest. "I'm going to take the path over the mountain." "Shorter through the forest," says the second one. So, they went their different ways. When the woodcutter who took the forest path came to where they'd seen the shit, the lion was sitting there waiting for him. "Peace be with you, Uncle Lion," he says. "What are you doing here?" "I'm sick," says the lion. "And I need a man's brain to cure me. "God in his wisdom has sent you to me so I can eat your brain." "Listen, Uncle Lion," says the woodcutter. "What I'm going to tell you is the truth. "I have no brain. "I'm brainless. "If I'd had the least bit of brain, "I wouldn't have taken the path through the forest. "The one with the brain..." WOMAN: Mm! "..took the mountain path." MAN CHUCKLES: That's good! "May God grant you happiness," says the lion. And he set out for the path that led over the mountain. Antonio Gramsci! Antonio Gramsci. Un grande pensatore! ROARING ROARING They took a narrow backstreet that led to a cobbled quayside overlooking the lagoon towards the lido. In places, the grass had grown there over the cobbles. TINKLING Then they separated. He went to the edge of the quay and stared across the black water. And she... She'd taken off her sandals and was carrying them, and she wandered over to an abandoned boat. And she sat down on the platform by the stern, near the wooden oarlock. CREAKING The sun and water had stripped all the paint off the boat. It was now wood grey. Old. It must once have belonged to a wine merchant because there were several demijohns on their sides in the prow. He came over towards her. "Do you think they're empty?" she asked him. Instead of answering, he jumped into the boat, which rocked violently. "Sit down," for God's sake, "sit down!" she shouted, and she was crouching in the bottom of the boat. And its sides were smacking the water and splashing the air. CHIMING And Bruno picked up one of the empty demijohns and held it up against the sky with one hand, as if ringing the neck of a goose. "Empty!" he boomed. "Sit!" she shrieked. "Sit!" CHIMING And this is how they found themselves, lying on the rush mat in the bottom of the boat. After a while, the smacking of the water ceased, and a quiet lapping took its place. Yet the calm did not last long. Soon the boat was again lurching from side to side with water dripping from its gunwales, and its staves thumping the lagoon. CHIMING "If we capsize, can you swim?" she whispered. "No." "Yes, Bruno. Yes." "Yes." CHIMING CONTINUES TINKLING Afterwards, they lay on their backs, panting. "Look at the stars. Look at the stars there. "Do they make you feel small?" she said. SLOW GUITAR MUSIC MUSIC STOPS And she went on... .."They look down at us, the stars, and sometimes, Bruno, "sometimes I think everything, everything except killing, "everything takes so long, because they are so far away." SLOW MUSIC RESTARTS MUSIC STOPS Her teeth bit his ear... ..one of his arms, leaning over the side of the boat, and his hand was trailing in the water. MUSIC RESTARTS MUSIC STOPS The world changes so slowly. His hand, wet from the water, grasped her breast. "One day, there'll be no more classes. "I believe that, don't you?" SINGLE NOTE PLAYS Sometimes what words mean doesn't count for much. These were all pet names. SINGLE NOTE PLAYS "There's always been good and bad," Marietta. "We're making progress. Don't you believe that?" she said. "Hmm. Hmm. "All... All our ancestors asked the same thing. "They all asked the same thing, Marietta.

MUSIC STOPS Much later, they crossed the narrow island to the pierhead where the last vaporetto would stop. The music was all over, the bandstands empty. Only a few drunks, immobile as statues, remained in the piazza. ENGINE THRUMS Marietta went to fetch his instrument case and Bruno gazed across the lagoon. He could see the bell tower they had climbed that morning. The guide had said it had toppled over at the beginning of the century. "Hm-hm. No roots," he thought. He even remembered the date the guide had mentioned. 14th July, 1902. That was the year of his father's birth. To the right, there were still lights on in the Doge's Palace, and according to the guide that morning, the palace had been destroyed or partly destroyed by fire seven times. "There had never been peace in that building," he thought. "Too much power, and no roots. "One day it would be robbed and pillaged. "And after that, it would be used as a henhouse." ENGINE RUMBLES Marietta came back and handed him his instrument case. "Play for me. "Play me something. Now you must," said Marietta. Bruno put the instrument case down on the quayside and out of his pocket he took a small mouth organ and, turning towards the Doge's Palace, began to play. SLOW TROMBONE MUSIC As he played, he heard the music speaking and he asked himself whether Marietta heard the same thing. MUSIC CONTINUES MUSIC STOPS VOICEOVER: Before it is light... She was watching his back, relaxed and downcast, like the back of a man peeing, except that his hands were up to his mouth. And the music went on speaking. VOICEOVER: Before it is light... When you've dressed and gone into the stable... With her finger, she was touching the nape of his neck. VOICEOVER: When you've dressed and gone into the stable and the animals are lying there. She was pressing her hands between his shoulder blades and she could feel his lungs and the music in the roof of his mouth. VOICEOVER: And the animals are lying there on beech leaves, and your tiredness like a child you have dragged from its sleep. Her hand felt under the belt of his trousers. VOICEOVER: A child you have dragged from its sleep, and through the window you see the span of the stars. Suddenly, Marietta noticed that one of his bootlaces was undone. And she knelt to tie it for him. VOICEOVER: The span of the stars into whose well we're thrown at birth like salt into water. His lace tied, she stood up. VOICEOVER: Like salt into water. SLOW GUITAR AND TROMBONE MUSIC As he played... MUSIC STOPS ..neither of them heard the vaporetto approaching the pierhead. "Come to Mestre," she whispered. "Come to Mestre. I'll find you work." SOLO TROMBONE PLAYS MUSIC STOPS ENGINE RUMBLES On the last vaporetto going from Giudecca to the Piazza Roma there were only two other passengers. But Bruno did not sit down. He stood very upright... ..as if he was on parade. ENGINE RUMBLING FADES AWAY The bus back to the village left at 3am. Most of the band wanted to sleep. Some husbands leaned their heads on their wives' shoulders. In other cases, the wife leaned her head against her man. One by one, the lights were switched off as the bus took the road away from the Queen of Cities towards Verona. Sitting beside Bruno, the young drummer tried one final joke. The last light was switched out. "Do you know what hell is?" "No. No. "Do you?" "Hell is where bottles have two holes... "..and women have none." HIGH-PITCHED WHINE WHINE FADES AWAY Caro mio, addio.
