Would you like some ice? Hi Tony. - You are early. - Yes. Go away. - You, wait for us in the car. - Alright. When will you kiss me, baby? Maybe now. Where are you going? - I am taking the ice back to the fridge. - Let it melt. Okay. If you move, say goodbye to your balls, baby. - Call the team. Money is right. Is the stuff okay? I think so. Very well. Let's go now, come on. Police! Raise your hands! Don't even think about it. Hello? Lisa? Is the team on its way? Make a move and I'll blow your brains out! Cover me! Lisa, where the hell are you? Kill him, shit! Mancini ran away in the bathroom. Go get him. I'll take care of the other. Come out, you piece of shit! Christ! Shit! - Did you catch him? - No, he killed himself. - What? - He shot himself in the head. Let's go check. - So? - What's the matter? - He fooled you. - It's not possible! He faked a suicide. Motherfucker! How many times do I have to tell you? You must check that they are dead. We let Mancini run away. Who's going to tell the boss, now? What an idiot I was! We'll catch him, don't worry! Yes, we saw him yesterday. Yesterday afternoon. In Marseille. - Yesterday afternoon at 5pm... What the hell are you saying? Come in! Here are the photos of Manicini. Two years. Two fucking year that we have been chasing after those bastards and you screwed it all! What do you want more? I brought you heroine, the Chinese smuggler and even the money! I don't give a fuck about the drugs, you idiot! And I don't give a fuck about that Chinese either. He won't talk. I want their bosses! And I want that my best agents would act like real cops and not fucking kamikaze! We were about the call when the situation got worse. What should we have done? Let them go? Do you think I enjoyed being touched every night for two months by a bunch of drunkards? Enough with the bullshit you two! Do you have an idea of how much this mission cost to the Dept.? How will we recover the costs? Selling drugs? You are paid to follow instructions and the orders were to call us, never to take action! Where are you going? Do you always have to pee afterwards? Yes, but I didn't do it yesterday! The boss asked me if we were seeing each other. When, today? No, some days ago. I forgot to tell you. He was so furious today. You shouldn't have slammed the door at him like that. Sometimes I just can't stand him. Imagine if we finds out we do 'overtime'! He would have one of us moved somewhere else. I wouldn't want to lose you as a colleague. Only as a colleague? You are a good cop. But today I made a big mess. We could have got killed. It's already in the past. Don't think about it anymore. Do you have to light it up? Shall I go smoke outside? Do it for me. You are such a pain, you know? - Thanks. Hello? Hi. Yes. No, I haven't forgotten. Tomorrow morning at 9 at the judge's office. What? Are you kidding? What about me? Listen... Alright. Let's talk about it tomorrow in person, okay? Fuck... What's the matter? My ex-wife. This flat is hers, did I tell you? And now she wants it back. Where will you go? She told me she'll sort me out. She's a real estate agent. She's such a bitch sometimes. Why did she leave you? Because I wanted a dog. Because you wanted a dog? Yes. Do you know what a dog is? Quit the wining. I sold the villa and now I need the flat. - Have I ever left you on the streets? - No, but I have been moving houses for two years . I feel like a nomad. You should thank me. You never had to pay a cent for rent. Plus you wouldn't afford houses like those anyway. Right, keep making fun of me! Nevermind! - What should we tell the judge? - Confirm that we haven't changed mind. My lawyer told me the divorce will be effective in two months, thank god. Lawyers, vampires, bloodsuckers... Tell me about it. It would be nice to get rid of them. Mine charges me even when he calls me. Tony... How is he? We extracted the bullet right next to the heart. Let's hope he'll be strong to get out of coma. Let's hope. It was my fault. You didn't shoot. If they hadn't fooled me we would have caught Mancini, and Tony would be fine. It happened. And it was his fault as much as yours. And mine as well. I should have expected revenge. Very well. He made it. Now it's only matter of time. - Thank god... - I'll be back later. Be careful, she's very dangerous. - I'll kill you all! - I'll kill you all, all! It's the girl shouting? No, she is special. Never trust what she says. - Head Nurse from Director. - Head Nurse from Director. Are you new? I have never seen you before. Don't be afraid. What's your name? Marco. Marco... Ah, Marco... That's my son's name. I brought you lunch. Don't go away. Would you do me a favour? I need a piece of paper. Look on the nurse's table. Come on! Good! You were a bad boy, bad boy, bad boy! I had to punish you! Here we are. Another day in that hospital and I'd go crazy! Listen... ...I need time to think. I didn't even go to her funeral. Elvi was still my wife. I am sorry... I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Tony... - Are you sure you don't want talk about it? - I'd rather not. I just want to help. You can. Just leave me alone. As you wish. Bye It's me, Tony. Don't be alarmed. Are you crazy? I could have killed you. How do you feel? I have a man outside the door in the event Mancini wanted a second chance. I should have done it before. You did indeed damage him and his Organisation. Thanks. When I left the Crime Dept., I asked you to come with me. You know... ...I think you are an excellent cop. I would still be in the streets if it weren't for you. You taught me everything I know. Look, for the slamming of the door... No worries. Call me tomorrow. Let me know how# you feel. I will. Take care. Thanks. - Hello? - Hi. Hi. - How are you? - Lisa, I am fine! Wait, someone is ringing the doorbell. Fuck! - What's up? - I burnt the eggs. - Good for you... Let me go open. I'll call you later. - Tony, be careful. - Yes, don't worry. Who is it? - Photo Lab. Hello, have you delivered some photos to Elvi Giordani? - Giordani? Yes sir. - How come? - Madame left a film to develop but her agency is closed so we delivered it to her house as tomorrow we close for holidays. She must have forgotten about it. - Hello? - No, she didn't forget it. - Thanks. - Goodbye. I made some slides so we can see the details better. Are the photos of that man who got killed yesterday ready? - On the table. - Very well. Thanks. Stop! This one. Can you zoom in? Already did, for what I could. I think you are right. That's not a reflection of a mirror or if it is, it must be very small. If you look closely you see a shadow. I think those are glasses. There must have been somebody behind the window. Hey you, go there. Come on, hurry up! Be careful not to touch possible fingerprints! Be alert guys! The body is in a mummifying state, with the head in the oven. Possible cause of death: gas poisoning. Death, judging from the state of the clothes... ...can date 4 or 5 years ago. It looks like a male individual around 30 years of age. Are you done? Can we work now? - It's all yours. - Good. Guy, focus on finding fingerprints, and you try to take some decent photos. - Tony! - Hi! - My colleague, Lisa. - How are you? - Hello Lisa. George is an old friend, and also the best ripper and anatomophatologist of the Country. - Of the world, brother! - Of course of the world. Hurry up here. I'll search the basement, you come with me. What the hell are you doing here? Are you in the Special Force? Personal reasons... Maybe my wife's murderer has something to do with this house. Elvi? - Elvi is dead? - Yes. - When did it happen? - About a month ago. Oh, my god... - I am sorry. - Thanks. Probable suicide, male, 30 years old. I'll be more precise after the autopsy. I'll call you, Alright? - You're a real friend. - See you. Tony, what the hell are you doing here? It's not your case. I don't want you around. Go back to your heroine and your Special Force. And now go away! You are the biggest asshole in the world, Al Murphy! Fuck you! Let's go! The id says his name was Marco. The only letters of the surname are B, E, A. - Right. The man who was here is the reason why Elvi was killed. Tony, you are talking nonsense! Mancini is the responsible for the murder of your ex-wife you know it, you snatched his heroine! Mancini's case and Elvi's murder are two different things. Elvi only took some photos of this house but the killer didn't know that and thought she saw him. However she didn't see anything! She just found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time. And now I have to find out who was in this house that day. Car accident on highway 20 intersection highway 31, go there immediately. - I repeat, Car accident on highway 20 intersection highway 31, go there immediately. Here are all the photos I was able to find. Maybe there are more in the archive. - Tony, can you come to my office? I think you should do it easily. - I need a bigger copy of this one. - Yes, yes. - Will you do it? - Yes I'll take them all with me. Alright then... Come in. Have a seat. I don't know why I smoke this stuff. It's terrible. Al Murphy from the Homicides called me. He's pissed at you. What the hell were you doing in that house? I want to find out who killed Elvi. Mancini did. You are not in their team anymore, let them work. What you found in that house was pure coincidence. There are too many coincidences. Professional killers don't make mistakes. The guy was 5 Mt from me, he couldn't have missed me even if he wanted to. Instead he shot at Elvi first. I was not his target. Tony, you are tired. Deal with Mancini or take a vacation. Did you see those photos taken by Elvi? Yes! But I couldn't tell if someone was hiding, and even if it were true don't forget about that gorilla with sunglasses at the Chinese restaurant. I read your report. I'll catch Mancini but not because of Elvi. Yes, thanks. I'll bring you that report as soon as it is ready - Thanks. - News on Mancini? - Nothing new. - I am going to eat. Do you need anything? - Cigarettes. - Stupid request. - I have something for you. It's the address of the lawyer who's dealing with the abandoned house. I still have friends in the old team. Remember, I didn't give you anything. Thanks. - Here's latest info on the Far East. - Finally, very good. I am sorry do you know at what floor is the Lawyer Jarno? - No, no. Of course, get the lift to the 4th floor. - Thanks. - You are welcome. - Who is it? Police, I need to speak with the lawyer. Good morning - Have you got an appointment? - No I haven't but it's important. Wait here, please. It's a very sad story. Yes, I have been managing that property only for a year, so... ...I can't help you. I have already told your colleague of the Homicides. Who would have thought... a suicide... Whom does the house belong to? To a millionaire, Mrs Beaumont. She's from a noble French family. That house is only a small portion of her assets. How do you spell it? B, EAU, MO, NT. I'd like to meet her. Not easy. She is in a hospital. Is there any relative that I can contact? - No, she is alone. - She had a son, but he disappeared many year ago. - I think even before she got in the hospital. Which hospital is it? Please, give the agents the information he needs. Thanks for your help. The doctor is crazier than his crazy patients He analyses, he spies... He'd anything to get into our minds. Sooner or later he'll do something crazy. Today is April 17! It's not a normal day I'll ask the chef to serve... ...some red caviar, sent to us by Prince Ivan. My husband loves caviar. Very bourgeois. It's injection time. What should I do? Tie you up? I can ask for help. I am not afraid of you. Put your arm outside the window Why don't you do that? It could be an interesting experience. Hurry up! Come on sweetie, try! Are you afraid? I won't hurt you. You'll pay for this.. Rest assure... Poor fool! How come all this interest in the Countess? Is it about some crime? I am here for this reason. I need to speak with her. 'To speak at her' is more accurate. She is asocial Well, she is asocial don't be surprised if she won't answer your questions. I'll make sure she will. Can I get in her cell? Absolutely no! Even if she looks harmless and behaves normally... ...the Countess is very dangerous. She killed her husband and cut him into pieces. Remember not to get close to her no matter what. You must stay in the middle of the room, away from the glass. Don't give anything to her. Don't accept anything from her. Be careful you can hurt yourself. If you don't mind, I would like to be alone. Good morning. I'd like to ask you some questions Countess. I spoke to your lawyer and administrator of your assets, and she told where to find you. I won't disturb you long, I promise. It's about your son. What did he do this time? Marco gave me so many sorrows and troubles he stole my youth, you know? And beauty. It's his fault I am here. Stress, worries... He was always a difficult boy, but I loved him. When he was a child, he did cruel games, tormenting my dogs, we had many my husband loved them I lived for them. If there was a crazy person in the family, that was my husband. Unfortunately I have to give a bad news. Marco... ...killed himself. I have to tell the doctor. There was a tragedy in your life recently Isn't it? I can read it in your eyes. We have something in common, us two. I bought a lovely tea set! Very rare! The Queen of England wanted it, too! It's time for her medicine. Here's my number. Call me if she says or does something that may interest me. I spoke to Homicides it looks like Marco liked to play Frankenstein. Do you remember the Full Moon Killer? I dealt with that case too, for a while. He killed several women before disappearing and they were all red-headed. He stabbed the victims and cut their head off. Homicides thinks Marco is Full Moon Killer? It looks like it. Maybe he killed himself out of regret for what he had done. Murders stopped and in that period, his mother was taken to the hospital. This means that now they can close the case. They already did. But there's something you must know something that doesn't fit what we have said. They have found a gun in that house and ballistic exam say... What? ...it is the same guy that killed Elvi. And so we go back to Mancini. Heroine that you have seized is rather strange it contains chemical products. Go back on the case. To lose that big deal... ...must have been rough for them. Instinct tells me that Mancini is still around If you catch him, we'll catch all his Organisation. Yes, sure Boss! Sure! Yes, yes... I am trying to find out where they are hiding it! Give me more time. It's not easy! - It's your problem. Kill that cop that caught you. Hello! Hello? Go fuck.... .David! Hi Tony. David? It's a friend. I see you haven't lost time - He's taking me to a party. - Sure. I understand. - Is this a work meeting? - Actually, no. I have come to apologize. I have been an ass. I am sorry. Get in. Hello. Hi David. No problem. I'll see you there. Bye. Do you want a ride? That'll be nice. I'll never find a taxi now, and I am already late. What do you need it for? Mancini has already got you, I could be the next a cop must always go back home alive, you taught me that. Fair enough. Boss thinks Mancini is still in the city. I don't want to talk about our work, not tonight. As you wish. I'll be your driver and I'll take you to your friend David. Ladies and gentlemen, Romano Mussolini! Thank you. Thank you very much. The bass, Aldo Vigorito. Bravo! Did you hear what happened last night at the opera? The audience started to boo at the end of the first act. - Really? I have never seen such a thing! - My mother is crazy. - Really? She's totally insane! She should have been an actress she loves drama...great in the role of the victim! When I was a child she wanted me to be an actress. I am not kidding. She took me to every audition, and I ended up hating the stage. I would have killed her, but at that time I didn't have a gun. Is this the reason why you have become a cop? You'll never know why. Poor David, he must be wondering what happened to you. Right, poor David. Very good, that's the way to go, Lisa. Such a classic! I'll be back. Thanks. I would have never told him if I hadn't had to! - Did you tell him? - I did indeed! I would have done the same. Please. - It looks wonderful. - Thanks sir. - Is everything Ok? - Yes, thanks. Let's go! What are you waiting for! Get in the car! - Are you okay? - Yes, I am fine. - I like this better than the lobsters. - Poor lobsters. What a cruel end! Better them then us! I agree. How is it possible that they found in that house the same gun that killed Elvi.. Who killed her was in that house, saw her and didn't want her to find the heads. Marco Beaumont was not the Full Moon Killer I am not following you. Nevermind. With tomatoes and beer you look like a set table! Let me do it. Lisa, I want you to understand me. When Elvi was killed I felt it was my fault. We knew each other for so long, it was like ...losing a part of me. My youth, my past. We took different paths in life, we changed a lot we fought like dogs and cats yet, ...we still cared for each other. And when you took me back home from the hospital... ...I couldn't help but... I understand. Lisa, weren't you going out tonight? Tony, this is Judy, my flatmate. Hi. Hi. Please don't answer the phone. What if it's an emergency? Then do as you wish. Treacherous... ...when you are with your wife, you only give her your body Yet to reach your orgasms... ...you come to me! For the greatest pleasure, only I can untie you from the chains of ancient shame you can never live without me. You can't wait! You are already aroused. Let me see. Hello? Yes, put him on the phone. Hey, George. No problem, I was awake. What's up? Okay. I'll be there right away. I've examined that mummified body but please, don't say a word, until I report back to Homicides. I promise. Come on, tell me. It's a woman. It's not Marco Beaumont. I'd have found out earlier if I didn't have to work on all these other heads. Marco should still be alive. I only know that this body isn't his. Now Homicides must reopen the investigation on the Full Moon Killer. I need a name and face to that body. Give me a couple of years and maybe I'll find out something, okay? Can you not rebuild the face with that new technique you told me about. You are asking me to do a miracle. You can do it. You are a genius... Come on, you can do it! You are a son of a bitch. Is that a yes or a no? Yes. Yes, I'll be there. Oh my god! They cut off her head. It's that Motherfucker again. He's back to kill again. Come on, hurry up. Clean up this mess. - A moment please. - It's all yours , doctor. Move the body over there. I'd like to speak to the director. Good morning. What? I'm coming! A moment. I'm coming! Good morning. - Where's Tony? - He went out. - Who are you? - A friend, I need to see him. Did I wake you up? Do you want to leave a message, madame? I don't know when he'll be back. No, don't worry about me. I can wait for him. Alright. - I am making some coffee, would you like a cup? - Thank you. It happened around midnight. Yesterday was Saturday. We are under-staff during the weekend. How can she do it? I don't know. Nobody has a clue. I'll keep you company. If you wish. I had a bad dream last night. - I'll try to find Tony. - You are very kind, but I am not in a hurry. I am thinking about finding a job, to keep me busy. I'll be the first woman in my family to work. What a great concept! Madame, you haven't told me your name. No, I want a tea! Only savages drink coffee. It's better if I find Tony. Where were you last night? I...I... I had an argument with my wife. So I went for a walk. Walking helps me calm down. Then I came here. Can't you call him via radio? Yes, I'll wait on the line. I'll be there in a second, madame. Try again. Call me in case you have news. You have my home number... I wrote it on... You must find her. She is extremely dangerous. Maybe the Countess went to my home. You know what. Nevermind. - Hello? - Are you okay? Tony, finally, I looked for you everywhere. Where are you? I am at the criminal hospital. Beaumont's mother has run away she took my phone number. There's an old lady here, red hair. - It's her! She has killed a nurse, be careful. - Okay. Hello? - Yes. - INPS. - What? - The stuff is at INPS. You are two assholes. I must tell you everything! What the hell is INPS? Come on, move your ass and find out! Let's go. No, you stay here. It's a miracle I am still alive, But I don't understand why she left me the photos of that beheaded woman... If we find her we'll understand. Let's hope so. She is the only person that can help us, where can she be hiding? Look, she killed a woman last night she can keep killing. I just received a box, there was this inside it. - You have a beautiful head, beautiful hair the next one is you, whore! - We'll have fun together, before I add you to my collection of heads. - I was missing a lawyer, you know, somebody with the head on her shoulder so to speak! - I'll come get you now, tomorrow or maybe next week, who knows. Can we have the tape? Thanks. If somebody rings the bell, make sure you know who it is before opening it. I will. Please, do not speak to anyone about this tape. Alright. - ...somebody with the head on her shoulder...so to speak! - I'll come get you now tomorrow, maybe next week. The voice could be anybody's it's impossible to identify. - I know. That's why I have many doubts. The Countess killed all those women in a temporary insanity When she found out that her husband understood she was crazy, she killed him as well. and now she's back in business. At least, this is what Homicides thinks. This is how those morons think to close the case? It's not a solid story. Why did the Countess come to look for me when she escaped? What did she want me to understand with the photos of the dead prostitute? Marco Beaumont must still be alive since the body found in that house was a woman. Who killed Elvi then? I have a gift for you. I have to put it somewhere cold. Hey you, show me the badge. Tomorrow morning, it's better you send someone at Jarno's home before she gets killed too. - I'll take care of it right away. - Hello? - I know I woke you up, but Boss wants you to go to Mrs Jarno's house tomorrow early in the morning - She needs protection. Alright. The safe is here, at ground floor. - Is the money and the stuff in there? - Yes, if they didn't move them yesterday. - Pray God they are there. The stuff must be in the safe. Come on, open it up. I am dead tired. I must sleep a little. Hey, where's the guard? I don't know, he must have gone to the toilet. Let's go. Go check.. How many are they? How many do you want? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! You are crazy, Mancini, did you really think you'd get away with this? Calm down guys! See, I am unarmed! You got me! I'll be better here, with you. Without money or drugs. I am a dead man out there. If I speak, you'll protect me as a witness, right? You'll give me a house, some funds and a new name. Done deal! Now we are friends! Okay? Friends? - Which floor? - Fifth. Come on, madame. - Who are you? - I am agent Bonetti, of Special Force Dept.. I am here to protect you. - Have you got an ID? - Of course. Here it is. Madame? Madame? I was sleeping. Have a seat I'll get dressed and be there in a second. Take your time. - What did you discover? - I made it! I made it! The head has now a face! - I did it for you, you owe me a bottle! - Come on let me see. I was right: she was poisoned. Death dates back 4 years ago. Countess was already in the hospital by then. Maybe this woman has killed her son. I think she wasn't one of the maniac's victims. The corpse has no sign of violence. The other heads all looked the same. This one instead... ...is different, she wasn't beheaded. Here it is. A nice job, uh? Call me genius. If this head belongs to the body found in the house so who is the person pretending to be Paola Jarno? Yes, Marco Beaumont had plastic surgery! Paola Jarno is Marco Beaumont, what a fool! Oh my god, Lisa! Would you like a cup of tea? No, actually, I'd like a coffee. I am sorry I hate coffee. Tea is good, then. I can boil the water for the tea. I looked around, it's only the two of us, so you can relax. You are a red-haired bitch, just like my mother. Police! - Lisa! - Tony! Tony hurry, I am here! I let you out of that hospital but you ran away... now I'll punish you! Mum... Why did you do this to me? Stop, Marco! Don't do it! Give me the gun! Marco, come on. Come on, be a good boy! Lower the gun! Come on! You're a good boy. Lower the gun. Very good, lower it down. Nothing will happen. I promise you. Come on, lower it down. Very good. Now throw it on the floor. Good. Drop the gun. Are you okay? I'll call the ambulance. Everything is over. I'll call the Homicides. Tony! - Tony... - I know. Check they are really dead. Don't worry. Everything is fine. - Come on! - Come on, mate! Come on, catch it! Go get it! No, be nice! Hey, what do you want to do with that dog? - Where do you want to take him? - Let's adopt him. He's coming home with us! I don't think so! You must choose: me or the dog. - Attention, all units, the beheaded body of a woman has been found in a public park there was an old woman with red hair she is thought to be a patient who escaped from a criminal hospital, a very dangerous subject. - Attention, all units, begin the search.
