What are you doing? I'm capturing the moment. Do you always have to film everything? Stop! Go on, go on. You say you love the 4th. Yeah, and sparklers and fireworks. Yeah, and picnics. - Heck yeah. - Okay, yeah, what else? Oh, kids. - Nevermind. - Oh, sorry. No. What are you doing? What are you doing? David? What are you doing? Grace, I want to ask you a question. Yeah? Would you please give me your ring finger so I may propose to you? Jesus! Put on the full armor of God so you can take a stand against the devil's schemes. He's the only one who can help you. Okay, okay. Hello? Hey? I was really nervous to show up. - It's fine, my fault - I hope - I don't have a phone. - it's okay. Of course. You're my little sister. - I didn't have time to tidy up. - Oh, my God. I thought you'd redesign the whole place. Cat, this is amazing. I can't believe this whole house is yours. Well you weren't old enough to get it, so. No, it's good, I'm glad you did. Is that our Magicland? I dug it out of storage before Abby was born. I missed you. I'm really sorry I wasn't there for you when you needed me. And here you are when I need you. I'm the big sister. It's my job to protect. Take a look around. I'm in the downstairs bedroom. You're in Mom and Dad's old room. I never go in there. Yeah, okay. Um, I need to sort out an idea for my thesis for next semester. Do you have WiFi? No central heat either. Oh, yeah. Go on, take a look around. I have to get some more wood chopped. Do you need some help? You bring an ax? Will you help me carry the firewood in? You wouldn't move. You couldn't have gotten out of the way for two seconds. Instead you just... I thought I'd rather stand my ground. And how did that work out? It's hard to remember. Yeah, concussions tend to have that effect. How many days are you staying? You sick of me already? No, I just, I don't drink much anymore. Well, drink up. It's a special occasion. Your little sister's in town. I'm sorry your engagement is off. Yeah, well, I'm not. What can I say? They were horny and I was passed out. It's kinda my fault if you think about it. Grace. And on my birthday, too. Yeah, well, they're both lying assholes. They will be perfect for each other. - Grace. - What? It's okay to be hurt. You don't have to hide it. You loved them and they betrayed you. My own husband did the same thing. After court, I, I begged him to bring Abby up here so I could say goodbye. I'm sorry. I pretended to hate him 'cause I didn't wanna be hurt. Letting myself feel sad is the only way I could heal. I'm sad I can't always hear the floorboards crying. They're loud sometimes and sleeping makes my stomach hurt. What? What? It's time for bed. I sleep when the sun goes down. I like to keep a consistent pattern. Please do the same. Okay, ma'am. The dishes can wait. Good night. David. Do you love me? Yeah. Will you always love me? No. I like the Rainbow Crunch. Where are you going? It's your turn. I don't want to play hide and seek. I want to play Magicland. If you don't play your turn, Penny's gonna play for you. Abby? - What are you doing? - Jesus. Why are you spying on me? - I wasn't spying. - What are you doing? I was cold, I was just coming to get another blanket. I will get you a blanket! Cat, you're freaking me out. Are you okay? I'm fine. Get some sleep. Good night! Night, Cat. Okay, um, it's December 18th. I guess I don't really know how to start. This is stupid. I'm Grace Elizabeth Crawford. It's December 18th and I'm on winter break. I don't really know why I'm recording this. Dammit, I'm completely not sure about the ethics of this either. My sister, my sister... She moved here six years ago, our family's old cabin in the middle of nowhere. She moved here six years ago shortly after divorcing her husband. I haven't spoken to her much since her move here. No phone. I wrote her letters, she rarely writes back. Since arriving, I've noticed her displaying several symptoms of someone... She has been... My sister. Good morning. Coffee? Sure. You sleep okay? Sure. The blanket helped, thank you. It's really cold in that room. I don't go in that room. Everything okay? Yeah, my stomach's not feeling great. - I have some antacids. - Oh, no, I'm fine, really. One or two? Okay. You wanna talk about last night? What's to talk about? You were talking like a child. I was tidying up. You were talking to Abby. But Abby isn't there Catherine. Cat, talk to me. You think I don't know that? You think I don't know that my daughter isn't here? You think I need you to drive all the way up here to tell me that? You have no idea what it's like having your daughter just taken from you! Cat, oh, Cat, come here, come here. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Shh, it's okay. Do you remember holding me like this? At night? I was six. When Mom died. And I didn't understand why she would do that. And Dad didn't take it well. He'd spend all his time at the cabin and leave us home alone. He just didn't know how to deal with all my questions. You remember what scared me? Nothing. Yeah, nothing. The thought of nothing. Not existing. I was okay when I thought of death as heaven or hell, but nothing? Nothing scared me. Mom not existing at all. I couldn't sleep. I'd lay awake and cry while you held me like this. Do you remember what you did to fix me? Yeah. Yeah. You made me play with a Spirit Board. You made me believe in spirits. You showed me that nothing doesn't exist. You showed me how to talk to Mom again. I pushed the planchette. I know. You did what I needed at the time. I'm here for you. You can talk to me. What's wrong? It's right there. The electricity is listening right behind her. You can see it. I have to feed the chickens. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no. Abby? Abby you weren't in Mommy's pills, were you? Abby, you know we can't play in Mommy's room. Abby, Mommy will be very upset if you play in here. Abby? Abby? Abby? It's December 19th now. Oh, okay, so, um... Okay, she is talking like a child now. Penny. My mother was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when she was pregnant with me. I never knew the mother that my sister knew or the woman my father did. I was too young. She, like many victims, took her own life. Mommy? I blamed myself. I triggered it. Come on, Grace. Detach and analyze. Today, today I found prescription antipsychotic medication in my sister's, my, my big sister's... I'm scared. Grace? Just a second. Grace? Yeah? Are you feeling better? I'm still a bit nauseated. - I - brought some soup. Oh, my god. - Is that our... - Yeah, I, I kept it, I thought I'd try being the big sister again. Are their any spirits present who wish to communicate with us? What is your name spirit? - Who's Penny? - Stop moving it. Ask it something else. Spirit, is my sister having a boy or a girl? Why would you say that? To protect you. It started happening to me after I gave birth to Abby. Paranoia. Grace, I started hearing things. Voices. Telling me that Jerry would hurt our baby. I started seeing things. You know that's why Mom killed herself. - Catherine... - Dad said she started to see a man in the house at night. The shadow. What are you talking about? She wouldn't take her medication. It's hereditary, Grace. - I know that. - I didn't wanna tell you what had happened or what could happen. I'm not hearing things. Or seeing things. Grace, I've been suffering from mild schizophrenia since Abby was born. I started hearing things and Jerry and I fought. He thought I was dangerous, but I would never hurt Abby. Are you on medication? Yes. It keeps me normal for the most part. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping. I get sick, my focus is off, but patterns help. The cabin helps. Being alone helps. Being alone is where the walls don't scream for a vacation. Grace, please just let me be alone up here. Just keep it our little secret. Who's Penny? Penny, I don't really wanna talk about it. It's embarrassing. Does Penny talk to you? Do you see her? Penny is how I talk to Abby. I'm coping, I know, I read it. But when I'm Penny, I can see Abby. So is Penny real? Do you hear her? No, Grace, I'm just a mother coping with having her daughter taken from her. Okay, after the divorce, I didn't know what to do. So I came here, I thought I could just get away from the noise. Sustain myself, prove to Jerry that I'm better. I begged him. I begged him to bring Abby up here. I just wanted to see my daughter one last time. Did he come? No. What happened? I don't know. He's gone. I just started telling you this because I , I don't want it to happen to you. Okay. Cat. I love you. I love you too. You stupid bitch. I don't want you. Should I have the baby? Will I regret it? Is it a boy or a girl? David? - Oh. - Morgan? Grace. I'm, I'm. You're better off alone. You sleep okay? I slept better. You almost done? I was gonna make us some breakfast. It's 4 p.m. What? You slept the day away, sis. I gotta finish up with this wood, get some to the house, to the shed. Feed the chickens. - I can cook some dinner. - No, no, I made some steak and kidney pies. They're in the fridge. Can you just get those in the oven? Uh, yeah, okay. Will you take a pile of wood back to the house for me? Yeah, of course. Hello? Come on, Grace. Dear heavenly father, thank you for this bounty you have blessed us with. Please let this food nourish us and keep us strong. Thank you Lord for this time with my sister. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. Last night I had nightmares. You slept a long time. Do you see things often? Are the voices always there? What are you talking about? The voices. Seeing things. Seeing Abby. How long where you two engaged? A few months. David proposed on the 4th of July. So he wouldn't forget the date. Did it start with the dreams? The paranoia? Have you talked with Morgan since you walked in on them fucking? She was one of your best friends, right? What? What, are they engaged now? Did you keep the ring? I don't know, why are you asking me this? I don't wanna talk about it. Exactly. How's the pie? I'm sorry. It's really good, actually. I get half a cow from a farm a mile up the road. Milk, eggs, phone. It's a good walk. It lasts me through the winter. You were right. I'm pregnant. I didn't get peas the last time I was town. The Brits typically eat it with peas. I heard things. And the dreams. My sister is suffering from mild schizophrenia. She calls it mild. She's in and out. But overall, she seems to be fine up here. For how long, I don't know whether the disease gets worse or she has long-term side effects from the drugs. I don't know. She doesn't want me to share any of this with the outside world. She thinks being alone is the best solution. I don't know how long a solution it will be, though. Will I see my sister again after this trip? I think it must have been easier when people believed it was demonic possession. Spiritual. It was easier when I did. With that there's hope or blame. The boogeyman did it. Call it a disease and there is no boogeyman. No one to blame except your parents and the fear that you'll end up just like them. I know she's gone. At least the sister I knew. Or maybe it is a demon. I don't know. Okay, I'm documenting this. Last night I took a pregnancy test, it was positive. I know it sounds crazy, but I asked the board a few questions. I pushed the thing myself, and I answered them myself. I asked it if I was having a boy or a girl. It didn't answer, I put it back in the wardrobe. I did not do this. Huh-huh, I got you Captain Rogers! Okay, I got you! I got you! It's your turn. Abby, let's go to your room to play. Mommy is upset. Catherine. It's time for bed. It's time for bed! Hey, not all at once! Who is girl? Uh, uh, uh, uh, not all at once. I know that. You know I know that. Shh. Will she get better? Please make her better. I wanna be better. Hello. Oh, I, I, I, I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong! It's okay. I met you. Put on the full armor of God, so you can take your standing. It doesn't help when it's inside you. Coming for you. She wants me to hurt you. Who? I'll show you. Can you hear them yet? You're better off alone. How'd you sleep? I slept better. Sorry to interrupt last night. It gets worse at night. I really wish you'd leave me alone at night. It's embarrassing. I'm sorry. I noticed you cleaned everything. Busy morning. It's 4 p.m. You slept the day away, sis. Again? Lousy company I've been. I gotta finish chopping this wood. Get some up to the house, to the shed. Feed the chickens. Um, I got some steak casserole in the fridge if you wanna get that cooking. Sure. Hey, did you pick up the Spirit Board? If I did, it'd be in the bookshelf. Yeah, I looked. It's not there. It'll turn up. Can you take a pile of wood back to the house? Yeah, of course. Hello? Stop, stop it. Dear Lord, thank you for this time with my sister. In Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. I couldn't find the Spirit Board. It'll turn up. Do you believe in, um, spirits? Not since we were kids. I asked the board some questions about my baby. It doesn't work with just one person. I asked it if I was having a boy or a girl. And when I went back, G-I-R-L was circled in Crayon on the board. I was gonna show you last night, when you bumped into me, I dropped the board. Well demons aren't real and I don't have Crayons. It isn't funny. I know what I saw. I recorded it. What? I recorded it on my camera, here I'll show you. What do you mean you recorded it? - Just hold on. - What do you mean you recorded it? - I said, hold on. - What were you recording? - Nothing. - Nothing? Are you recording me? How's your thesis coming? I asked you how your thesis was coming? And were you recording me? - No. - Were you using me as a lab rat? Did Jerry send you here? What did you do? I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to. You, you were acting really strange and I didn't know what was going on until you told me. I'll delete it, I'll delete it, here, here. It was, it was, it was, it was in here. I, I put it in here, I put it in here. Like, this is where I put the board too. It was, it was in here! I put it in here! You have to believe me, I am not delusional! The closet, in the hallway. Maybe, maybe you put it in there when you were cleaning up. Yeah, I heard something in the hallway closet. It was locked. Something in the closet did it. In it, something's in it! Can we check it? Please. Cat? Please. There's a reason Dad always kept it locked. So did I. You can look for your game if you like. No, I'm fine. I'm fine. You're not allowed in there. Come on, don't you wanna meet her? She wants to say hello. Don't you wanna meet your daughter? Don't you want to meet me before you kill me? Don't you wanna meet your daughter? Don't you wanna meet me? You're better off alone. Hello. Hello. (wood cracking How'd you sleep? Good. I think I'm getting a little cabin fever. Squeeze. I was close. Here. Feel my hand. Squeeze. - Got it? - Mm-hmm. Try again. Squeeze. How do you shoot things when they're moving? Deer are typically bigger than cans of beans. Come on, I gotta finish up the wood. Get some in the house, to the shed. Feed the chickens. Now, there's some liver steaks in the fridge if you wanna get those cooking. Sure. Do you want me to put the gun away? The key's over the door. What are you doing? They're burnt. Please let this food nourish us and keep us strong. Thank you Lord for not letting my sister burn the house down. In Jesus' name we pray. - Amen. - Amen. This is so weird. Why? I just can't believe you found this after all these years. I feel like a kid again. In a good way. Old things are good. I'm hearing things, Cat. The house creaks, Grace. And I probably moved your game. Sometimes I lose things. I don't remember moving them, but they turn up. Do you think I would be a good mother? You are going to be a good mother. No, I mean, could I raise a child? What are you saying to me? I've just been thinking. If I'm hearing things, what happened to Mom. If it happens to me too. Maybe I shouldn't have the baby. I still feel her sometimes. She writes me letters. I can't always get them out, though, so she just, she just reads them aloud sometimes. But the atoms are always there, the genomes, really. You can't give her away. Catherine. I am a good mother. Why would you say that? What is wrong with you? You think I'm a bad mother? You think I can't raise my own daughter? I am a good mother. I know. I know, I know you are. You're fine. You're not hearing things. She's your sister. She needs you. Can Penny come out and play? Mommy isn't feeling well. Hello. You're fine. You're fine. Little girl? Abby? I hear you. You're fine, Grace. You're fine. Push. You're better off alone. Mommy's not feeling well. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. What are you doing? I didn't sleep well. I chopped the wood. - I was gonna feed the... - I'll feed the chickens. I want you to leave. What? I want you to leave now. Please, Cat. Just relax, just calm down. You're making it worse. I need you to leave, get out. - I can't. - Just get out, get out, get out! Cat, help me, please. - Stop trying to trick me. - I'm not. Stop. Stop! - Stop! - I'm not, Catherine. He won't leave me alone. Stop trying to trick me. Did he send you here? No. Did Jerry, no I need you, you can't be here, you can't be here! Catherine, it's happening to me. No, no, you're fine. - I'm not fine. - Yes, you are. I'm hearing things all through the night. It's the house! It's not the house! Stop telling me it's the fucking house! I can see her. She's in my dreams. But when I wake up, she's still there. She's in my room. I followed her last night down the hall and into the office. She disappeared. Who? A little girl. My daughter. I can see her. As clear as I'm seeing you. I drowned her last night. You helped me. You helped me. You, you, - you, you helped me. - No, no. - You did it, you killed her! - No. No! What you're going through, that's how it started with me. Quetiapine will help you with the hallucinations. With what you're hearing. This will help with the anxiety and paranoia, and this will settle your stomach. I'm scared, Catherine. When you get home, get started on these. And see a doctor. I don't want this. When they come for you, it's best to hide the headaches. And when you have your baby, they'll take it from you. What do I do? You're making it worse, Grace. Get some rest tonight. Tomorrow, I need you to leave. Please forgive me. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. - And... - What are you doing? And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive those who trespass against us. Why are you praying? You're not real. I'm real, Penny's not real. Am I your mommy? Mommy's not feeling well. You wanna play? Okay. Good, I'll hide first. But be quiet, Mom doesn't want you to see me. Okay. Count to 20, no peeking. One. Two. Three. It's not real. None of it's real. Mommy isn't feeling well, Abby. Hello? Hello? Little girl? Keep it down! I fell. Mommy isn't feeling well. I'm sorry, Mommy. You made Mommy really mad. You cheated, lights have to be off to play. You found me. Your turn. Can we rest for minute before we play again? You're kidding, you've been resting forever. You like to play, huh? Yeah. Is hide and seek your favorite game? Mm, yeah. Who plays with you? Um, Mom, Penny. Penny, mostly. What's your name? Abby. Is Catherine your mom? Yeah. Why are you crying? Abby, I'm your aunt. I'm your Aunt Grace. It means, I'm your mommy's sister. We were little girls together. Did you play hide and seek? Yeah. Really, because your kind of bad at it. Well I found you, didn't I? Yeah. Does anyone else find you? No, but I can only play inside. This is boring, can we play hide and seek some more? I don't know if you're a good enough hider to play with me. I am. Do you wanna hide from Mom? I'm not allowed to go outside. That's what's gonna make this the best hiding spot ever. Come on. Abby? Abby, the best hiding spot is across the bridge. I promise. Mommy says the bridge isn't safe. I am right here with you. I'll protect you, okay? It's gonna be the best hiding spot in the whole world. Will you try for me? Okay, come on. Abby! It's okay, we're almost there. - No! - No, come on, it's okay. No, it's okay. Abby, you get back here right now! Catherine, what are you doing? What are you doing, Cat, Cat? Please, listen to me. It's me. Let her go. Mommy! Come here. - Help! - David! - Mommy! - David! - Jerry! - David! Jerry! Jerry! - David! - Grace. Get away from her, Jerry! David, help us, please! Go, go! - Jerry! - No, Cat. - It's okay, sweetie. - No, you're not taking here from me. No. No. You get in that house right now! I said, go! - Catherine, no. - You are not taking her from me! Abby, you come here right now! Abby, you open this door this instant! You are in big trouble! - Mommy, stop! - Mommy said not to leave the house. Mommy said outside was dangerous. You're working with your father again, aren't you? He's back again, isn't he? Isn't he? Grace is a very bad woman, Abby. Come back to Mommy. Abby, Abby, you get out here this instant! No, no. Mommy, please. You are not taking her from me, Jerry. You're a liar coming for her destiny. Split between us, don't let her. Mommy, stop. You're scaring me. Mommy would never hurt you, Abby. I would never let them hurt you, baby. I just wanted to keep you safe from that mean woman. I'm sorry, Mommy. It's just I really wanted to play with Aunt Grace. Why did you play with her? You know I'm always here to play. I know, Penny, it's just that Mommy wasn't feeling well, and I wanted someone to play with so I gave her clues but she couldn't find me. What clues? Honey, did you take the Spirit Board? Yeah. Did you circle G-I-R-L? No, Mommy, Penny did. Remember? Uh. I took her camera. Where is it, honey? She made a video saying that you're crazy so I took it from her. You stay here. Why? I have to give Aunt Grace her camera back, okay? Let me out! Cat! Let me out! I'm afraid my sister could be dangerous to herself. She catches herself from time to time when her sentences aren't making any sense. She's jumbled. When she does this, she's usually able to catch herself. It's as if she doesn't know what she's said, but from my expression, she knows she isn't making any sense. Cat, let me out! I went into psych because of the loss of my mother. Which eventually led to the failing health of my father. It effected him the worst. He'd spend every moment he could away at the family cabin, leaving me with Catherine. Sometimes at home, sometimes at the cabin. But he was always absent. She inherited me, the cabin, Mom. She inherited Mom. Cat, let me out of here! But I was young, I wanted to further understand it. I just never thought I would understand it on this level. I never thought that I would be watching the decay of my sister's mind. I never thought I would be questioning my own sanity. I know she is or is going crazy. I just hope I'm not joining her. Everything is going to be okay. Cat, you don't have to do this. Please, you don't know what you're doing. Aunt Grace? Yes? Why did Mom hit you? Your Mom is very sick, Abby. She needs our help. You aren't trying to hurt her, are you? Mommy says other people on the outside wanna hurt us. No, no, sweetheart. I love your mom very much. Can you help her? Can you, can you get that key? Good job. Give it to me, yeah, it's okay. Good job, okay. Just give me the key, okay, thank you. Okay, come on! Wait right here. Okay, which way is the farm? Okay, come on. Abby? - Stop! - Come on, Abby. Abby! - Mom, help! - Shh. Abby! Listen, I am trying to help you, okay? You just don't realize it right now. Please, you're mommy needs you to be strong, okay? Okay, come on. - It's okay. - Abby! Abby! Mommy, help! You're not taking my daughter. You're not well, Catherine. Now come on, Abby. Come on, honey, come to mommy. Don't go. Look, Abby. Abby, stop playing with that terrible woman - and come to mommy! - Why, so you can shoot me? I'd never hurt you, Abby. So you can keep her locked away until you completely lose your mind and start seeing her as someone other than your own daughter? No, I would always know her. Give her a chance, Cat. Protect her. Catherine. She needs to get out of this house. She needs to play with other kids. Give her a chance at a normal life. Like you gave me. What if she gets sick, Cat? Like Mom. Like you. The chickens in the shed. What's in the shed, Catherine? Chickens are in the shed. You're not well, Cat. It's just silly chickens. Where's Jerry? - I don't know. - Where is Abby's father? He was watching me! He came here to let you say goodbye. He did exactly what you wanted. Where is Jerry? - I don't know. - Where is he? He's a bad man who tried to take our Abby. Abby's been in the shed. You killed Jerry. I am a good mother. There are no chickens in the shed. You. Just Abby's father. You are not taking her from me!
