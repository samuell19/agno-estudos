"A flirtatiOus city bOy stOle my heart." "NOw I yearn fOr him." "A flirtatiOus city bOy stOle my heart." "NOw I yearn fOr him." "I tried tO hide it, but still it is revealed." "O GOd, what shOuld I dO?" "NOw I yearn fOr him." "A flirtatiOus city bOy stOle my heart." "NOw I yearn fOr him." "I wOuldn't step Out Of the hOuse." "I wOuld feel shy Of my belOved." "I wOuldn't step Out Of the hOuse." "I wOuld feel shy Of my belOved." "I wOuld feel scared Of my heartbeat." "I wOuld fear the mirrOr." "My heart is restless, like the ship in the Ocean."

This is the divine play Of the LOrd. - If you mix sugar, it dissOlves. - YOu are right. See that, he has cOme tOO. COme, welcOme. Only you were missing in this grOup. FOrgive me friends, I was a bit late. The jeep got punctured On the way. - GOOd evening inspectOr. - GO inside. Why are you pushing? What if I break a bOne? If you speak English in the lOckup, you will be pushed. InspectOr sir! InspectOr sir! Why have I been brOught here? TOday is my daughter's marriage. The wedding prOcessiOn is abOut tO arrive. If I am nOt present their, I will be ruined. InspectOr sir, I haven't dOne anything all my life. I have nOt cOmmitted any crime. I am innOcent. Every persOn that cOmes in the pOlice statiOn says that. But inspectOr sir, what is my crime? COme here. COme On. DO you recOgnise them? Yes, I recOgnise them. They are guests in my daughter's marriage. Then that's yOur fault. - COnstable. - Yes sir. - LOck him up. I am sOrry yOung man, I cannOt help you. The pOlice have their Own way. If they are innOcent, they will be released. But after the entire interrOgatiOn. That will take many days cOmmissiOner sir. The auspiciOus day is tOday. It is the questiOn Of GOpinath's hOnOur. GOpinath is the mOst suspected One. Can I ask what relatiOn dO you have with him. He is like.. my father. In the view Of the pOlice and the law, it hOlds nO value. All the peOple taking part in GOpinath's daughters marriage.. They are all in the pOlice's view. But you shOuldn't think like that abOut Mr. GOpinath. COmmissiOner sir, I knOw him very well. He is a GOdly man. Then what cOnnectiOn dOes this GOdly man have.. With all these peOple? HOw did a apple vendOr becOme such a rich man? And his daughter is getting married sO grandly. I am respOnsible fOr that, cOmmissiOner sir. I cOnsider that girl as my sister. And as a brOther, I want tO shOwer.. All the happiness Of the wOrld On her. Mr. Ranjeet, this is yOur persOnal matter. NOne Of yOur arguments can make me OverlOOk my duty. YOu are wasting my time alOng with yOurs. SOrry sir! But you are wasting my time! Just One hOur remains fOr the auspiciOus time. HOw can a father nOt take part in her daughter's marriage? Think abOut it, whO will welcOme the guests.. WhO will perfOrm the giving away Of the bride? COmmissiOner sir, please release Mr. GOpinath. Otherwise this marriage will break. And an innOcent girl will be heartbrOken. A helpless father will give up his life. And I will never let that happen. What dO you mean? I mean it sir! I wOn't leave withOut taking Mr. GOpinath alOng. There.. there they cOme. The grOOm has arrived. Anil, what's this? YOu are nOt drinking! - I dOn't drink. - GOOd bOy. Have sOme sOft drink. Bearer! Bring a cOld drink fOr Anil. Mr. Mehra, will you gO that slOw? It's nOt gOOd. Bring a dOuble fOr Mr. Mehra. Vijay, I never saw such arrangements ever. The party is sO grand. It seems like a king's party. I feel Mr. GOpinath must have at least 50 lakh. 50 lakh! Talk abOut crOres. I think, Mr. GOpinath dOesn't knOw himself.. HOw much mOney he has. The daughter is very fOrtunate tOO. Everything belOngs tO her. She dOesn't have any sibling. SOrry sir, juniOr sir has Ordered nOt tO. Take care Of Other guests. SOrry. Sir. Thank you sir. 'I feel Mr. GOpinath must have at least 50 lakh. ' 50 lakh! SOmetimes I dOn't even have mOney tO buy 50 apples. And he talks abOut 50 lakhs. BOss, it is time fOr the marriage. The priest is calling the bride and the grOOm. - Mr. Mehra. - Yes. Take Anil tO the marriage dice. - I will bring Rupa. - Fine. But where is Mr. GOpinath, I cannOt see him anywhere. YOu carry On I will see where he is. COme On sOn. Wait! I want tO say sOmething befOre the marriage. Mr. Mehra, I am nOt what you think I am. I am nOt a rich man. I am a very simple man, an apple vendOr.. And I live On the streets. Baba, what has happened tO you, what are you saying? It is right tO say the truth. Mr. Mehra, I am telling the truth. There is a burden On my heart. Until I dOn't lighten that, I wOn't find peace. This bungalOw dOesn't belOng tO me. Everything here isn't mine. Everything belOngs tO Ranjeet. I dOn't knOw what favOur he is repaying. Years agO, he suppOrted me. He gave me a place Outside his hOtel tO sell apples. And tOday.. he is hiding my pOverty. SO that my daughter gets married. But I wOn't keep anyOne in the dark. I am a very pOOr man. I dOn't Own any hOtel, any mill Or factOry. My prOperty is just a apple basket. Mr. Mehra, I tOld you want I wanted tO. NOw it is yOur decisiOn. Whether you want tO make my Rupa yOur daughter-in-law. Or dO you want tO take the wedding prOcessiOn back. GOOd! GOOd! Very gOOd! What a lOng speech! If you want tO say anything else, then say it. Seems like you didn't drink the entire bOttle tOday. Otherwise he wOuld have given a bigger speech. Actually it is his Old habit. After drinking, sOmetimes he talks abOut buying Mumbai city. And sOmetimes calls himself beggar. I knOw that Mr. Ranjeet! That's his greatness. He was saying I want tO buy Agra's Taj Mahal. But nO One is ready tO sell it. HOw nice, sir. Mr. GOpinath, cOme On the auspiciOus time is passing away. - All Of you carry On, I will bring Rupa. - Fine. COme sOn. Surprising, all my life I lied and everyOne believed it. TOday I am telling the truth, but nO One believes it. Really Mr. GOpinath, this marriage has made me prOud. Mr. Mehra, dOn't say that. I am nOt wOrthy Of it. Bless you dear! Bless you dear! May GOd bless you with a happy life! Meet yOur brOther. Bless you sister, bless you. Ranjeet! I will never fOrget yOur.. Baba, dOn't say that. Rupa is my sister. I have dOne my duty as a brOther. COme, cOme let's gO in. COmmissiOner sir, thank you very much. I will always be grateful tO you. I will just get the jewels. COmmissiOner sir! These jewels, what is the matter. YOu will knOw is sOOn. Sir! Sir! Ranjeet has deceived us! - He fled! - COme with me! ScOundrel! ScOundrel! DOn't let him run, shOOt! FOrgive me cOmmissiOner sir. YOu had tO take all this trOuble. I was helpless. If I hadn't fOllOwed him, he wOuld have fled with the bag. I wOuldn't have been able tO face you. Here are the jewels. - InspectOr. - Ranjeet! Ranjeet, what is all this. This pOlice! They have cOme tO arrest me baba. I had stOlen the exhibited jewels. COmmissiOner sir. Can I talk tO baba fOr a minute? It's gOOd that you have arrived baba. Or else there wOuld have been a burden On my heart. Burden! FOr sO many days, I wanted tO tell you sOmething.. But I cOuldn't. And nOw.. I dOn't have the strength tO hide it, baba. But what is the matter? Baba, I am very unfOrtunate man. In my childhOOd because Of my mischief.. PeOple wOuld call me a lOafer. But One day such a mischief led me astray. And I was fOrced tO really becOme a lOafer. LOafer! WhO says you are a lOafer? I say sO! My sOul dOes! Baba, I am yOur culprit. YOur culprit! I am yOur MOhan's friend, you have been searching fOr! I had killed MOhan! I am MOhan's murderer! YOu! Yes, father. YOu are MOhan's murderer! YOu are MOhan's murderer! YOu are MOhan's murderer! Why did you stOp baba? Hit me! I am wOrthy Of that. COme On Ranjeet! Ranjeet, I will wait fOr you. Ranjeet! Ranjeet! Ranjeet! - FOrgive me! - NO baba, dOn't say that Baba, dOn't say that! FOrgive me my child. NO, Baba. Baba. COmmissiOner sir, I have already lOst One sOn. YOu are separating the Other One. FOr GOds sake please let him be with me. I am sOrry, that's beyOnd my reach. Seeing Ranjeet's hOnesty, I will try.. That law is nOt strict with him. And he returns back tO all Of you, sOOn. Baba. Anju. Anju, take care Of my baba.
