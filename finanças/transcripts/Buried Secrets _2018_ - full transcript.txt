Can I come to meet your dad, too? - Okay. - Sweet. - Morning, Luke. - [Luke] Hi, Mr. Caldwell. [David] How are you? [Luke] I'm good, good. Um, my mom and dad were wondering if you guys would like to come over for supper sometime this week. Oh, well, that's very nice of them. Uh, they just felt really bad that they weren't at the funeral. [sighs] Okay, we're going. [David] Have a good day, you two. - Bye, guys. - Bye. [Sophie sniffles] Are you okay?

[line disconnects] [dramatic music] [doorbell rings] Uh, can I help you? Are... [sighs] Are you David Caldwell? [David] Oh, did, uh... Did you call my office earlier today? Uh, yeah. [sighs] Uh, I'm so, I'm sorry, do I know you? I'm Jordyn. Uh, uh... Jordyn Robinson. Oh, my God. Uh, just come in. Please, come in. [Jordyn] I hope I'm not disturbing you. No, you're not. Please, come in. Gosh, I can't believe this. Uh... God, you really do look like her. I, uh, I mean, not exactly, but the more I look at you... Yeah. You should have seen us when we were little. People used to think we were twins. Uh, s-sorry, can I, uh, can I get you a drink? - No, no. I'm okay. - Well, please, have a seat. Okay. [David grunts] Um... I'm sorry, uh, forgive me for asking, but how did you even hear about the car accident? I mean, unless there's something I don't know. You guys hadn't spoken in, what, 20 years? I, uh, um... - Do you know Aunt Phyllis? - I, uh, um... Uh, maybe. Quirky, with thick glasses. - Little m... Yeah. - Yeah. I'm not sure if she'd agree with you on that description, but, yes, that's Aunt Phyllis. Yeah. She's one of the only family members that I stayed in touch with. I see. I am so sorry about everything, David. And listen, I, I know what you must think of me and what you must have heard... No. No, no, no. Jordyn, listen, no. Uh, look... I loved your sister more than anything in the world. Uh, and I would do anything for her or the kids, but look, I know, she can be... she could be tough sometimes. A lot of the time. You know, as far as I'm concerned, the past is past. Just... Life's too short... as we know. Well, listen, I should probably get going. I shouldn't even have intruded on you like this. - Because... - Come on. No, you're family. I'm sorry. I didn't even, I didn't even ask. - Where are you staying? - Oh, just... You know, out by the airport. Fast and easy. - Well, we have a spare room. - No. - It's... - No. Uh, plus, all my stuff's back at the hotel, so... But if you don't mind, I would like to come back tomorrow morning and meet the kids? Well, I think they'd like that. - I'd like that. - Great. - A new start. - Yeah. Well... Family... You never know how much you're gonna miss it till it's gone. [dramatic music] Who is she? Uh, well, kids, this is, uh, uh... Uh, I'm your Aunt Jordyn. Your mom's sister. - Whoa! - Yeah. Well, thanks for coming. I'm sure mom would be touched. - Sophie... - No, no, no. It's okay. I'm sorry. Um... You know, I don't blame you. I haven't seen your mom in over 20 years. I've never met your brother and I've never met you. I deserve it. Well, uh, Jordyn, this is Sophie and this is Noah. So how old are you guys? I'm 16. Tsk. And she's 18. Hm. A young lady. Dad, what the hell is she doing here? - I should go. - Hey, no, no. You stay. Sophie. Now, you listen, young lady. I don't care what's happened, that doesn't give you the right to treat someone like that. Hey. - I'm so... - No, no, no, it's, it's okay. Go to her. - [door slams] - She needs you. [knocking on door] [sighs] Go away. [David] Soph, let me come in, please. I said, go away. Hey. Soph... What? We just buried mom a few weeks ago and that bitch shows up? Look... There's a lot between your mom and her sister that you don't know, okay? [sobbing] I just miss her so much. I know, honey. I know. I miss her, too. [mellow music] You know, David, I really appreciate the offer. I'm just, I'm not sure how comfortable I am with it. You know, you, you haven't even really had time to properly grieve yet. Look, maybe this is selfish, but... having you re reminds me of her. It's like having a piece of her still with me. It's not selfish, it's sweet. Besides, it's not permanent. Just until you get settled and find a place of your own. You said you're between jobs. Your lease is up. I mean, there couldn't be a better time for a change. And there is no statute of limitations on starting over. True. [instrumental music] - Hi. - Oh. I thought you'd never come back. [chuckles] Well, I'm here. Okay? [Sophie chuckles] Hi, Sophie. I didn't know you had company. Hi. I'm Jordyn. Sophie's aunt. My mom's sister. I'm Luke. Sophie's Luke. Come on, let's go. Whatever. You kids let me know if you need anything. [upbeat music on headphones] [car honks] You're Sophie's aunt. Why don't you call me Jordyn, Luke? Uh, okay. Hop in. I'll give you a ride. No, I actually have my own car.

No. But you're gonna break up with her. Why? Oh, you don't have to worry your pretty little head about that. I have my reasons. And that's all you need to know. Well, you can't make me do that. That's not really your choice anymore now. - Is it? - And what if I don't? Well, then I'm gonna tell Sophie that you begged me for a ride, gave me directions out here and then forced yourself on me. [scoffs] Yeah, she'll never believe that. Yes, she will, Luke. We both know that. But more importantly, so will her dad, your parents, your football coach and all the colleges you are applying to.

Uh, marketing and PR companies, mostly. Well, that's what I did before for non-profits and foundations. The companies have to be large enough to understand the value of SEO. - Tsk. SEO. - Search Engine Optimization. Right. [chuckles] Right. Uh, well, I-I can talk to Sharon in HR, see if she has any leads for ya. Yeah, thank you. That'll be great. I mean, just, if it's no trouble. - No. No, no. Happy to do it. - Okay. Okay. But how can you just leave and come here? Don't you have a job or anything? - Sophie... - No, no, no, it's, it's okay. I know this probably seems a little impulsive to you guys, but it's actually been a long time coming. - Yeah, but why here? - Don't worry. I'm not gonna be staying much longer in your guestroom. I might stay in the area, though. Who knows? - [car honking] - Oh, I gotta go. He can't come to the door like a gentleman? Dad, it isn't like the 1950s something. - Yeah. - Love you. Love you. Hey, Jordyn, come. - Hey. - [sighs] Am I supposed to send thank-you notes to everyone who came to the funeral? - Is that... Yeah. - Yeah. That's why they write their names and addresses in that book. Right. But I mean, if you're feeling overwhelmed, I'm, I'm sure people would understand. Yeah. It's ironic, isn't it? You know, Judy was the one who handled all those family stuff. I can actually feel her getting embarrassed for me. [sighs] - [David] Sophie. - Leave me alone. [David] Oh, what now? [sighs] Honey? [Jordyn] Oh, wait. David. David, David. It, it has to be the boyfriend. Talking to a dad in this situation is not the best idea. Trust me on this, okay? Judy would agree. Thank you. All right, just let know if you need... I promise. [dramatic music] - [knocking on door] - [sniffles] Go ay, dad. [Jordyn] It's not dad, Sophie. [scoffs] Then really go away! [scoffs] What are you, totally deaf or just stupid? Mm. Neither, I hope. I just wanna talk. Yeah, why the hell would I wanna talk to you? Well, because you can't talk to your dad about this stuff. [chuckles] And you can't talk to your friends because, well, we both know what you really think of them... and because... your mom's not here. [sniffles] Boys suck. Oh, do you wanna know the truth? Until they hit about 40, it doesn't get any better. You know, that jerk, he didn't even say why. He just said it wasn't working anymore. It was serious? I don't know. We're in high school. How serious could it be? But for senior year, he wasn't bad to have around. Dry your eyes. Come on. Come with me. [mellow music] Okay, ignore the mess, but, you know, with a little luck, hopefully, I won't be here much longer. Hey, at least my dad can't make you clean your room. [Jordyn] Yeah. Yes. Here it is. Your mom and I. Halloween, 1998. We both went as rock stars. You probably don't even know who that is. Yeah, I do, that's the star of the celeb rehab show, right? Yeah. Wow. She looks a lot like me. Yeah, minus the hair accessory, you two could twins. Yeah. You mom was so beautiful. All my boyfriends were jealous. This doesn't look like you, though. Yeah, I didn't really hit my stride until college. Be thankful you took after your mom. All right, let's go back downstairs. [dramatic music] [sighs] Sophie, you ordered the pizza, right? - Where is it? - [scoffs] Dad! The guy said, like, half an hour. - Eh. - Come on, David. relax. Just enjoy this time, you know, all of us together. [David] I am. I am. I just... I would enjoy it more with a slice of pepperoni. - You know... - I love family dinners. Always reminds me of when Judy and I were kids. Best time of my life. I miss it. Anyways, you said you had good news and I wanna hear it, so... Well, remember when I said I would mention you to HR? I spoke to Sharon and she says that they are thinking about expanding their team. So I told them that you had a specialty in SEO. - Yes. - I get that right? Good. And she says if you give her a call tomorrow, she'd love to meet with you. I don't know what to say. Well, don't say anything. Just blow her away. - Thank you. - [doorbell rings]. Ah! Finally. Well, I love your experience, Miss... Oh, uh, please, Jordyn, if you're comfortable. I love you experience, Jordyn, and I have to say, as I'm sure David did as well, this is a fortuitous time for you to come in. We have done a complete review of company policies and one of our recommendations was a marked increase in SEO. Well, I know I am biased, but I think it's the right decision. You know, it is the most effective way for companies like yours to increase their visibility. That said, I'll be blunt with you. We allow our current employees first interview. Not only do they understand how the company works, but we believe loyalty is a two-way street. [chuckles] I understand. Good. - Well, thank you for coming in. - All right. - Thank you. - No problem. [Sharon] We'll be in touch. [Jordyn] Okay. [indistinct chatter] - [knocking on door] - Hey. [chuckles] Hey, I didn't realize you were home. - Come in. - Okay. What are you doing? [sighs] Well, I kinda got tired of living like a hobo, so I planned on getting my own place. But until then, I thought I would unpack a little bit. - I would love some help. Yeah. - Okay. You have a lot of cool stuff. [chuckles] Yeah, well, when you get to be my age and you have lived as many places as I have, you tend to collect a lot of junk. [chuckles] - I don't think it's junk. - Well, then it's yours. - Really? - Yeah. You wear it better than I ever did, anyways. Hey, can I ask you a question? Sure. What happened with you and my mom? Why'd you guys stop talking? Well, what did your mom tell you? Well, she didn't really talk about it. She just said you guys had a falling out. And I never really met you, so I never really asked. We stopped talking because I was an idiot. Well, lots of people are idiots and that doesn't mean you have to stop talking to them. God, you remind me so much of her. Okay. Don't change the subject. [sighs] Okay. Okay. You know our parents died when we were little, right? Yeah, well, your mom, she was a little bit older than me, but she was a lot more mature. And we both got some life insurance money. And let's just say that I was really foolish and stupid. And your mom... she didn't like some of the decisions I was making and she wasn't shy about telling me, and I certainly didn't want to hear it. But by the time I realized she was right, she was married, starting a family with you guys. But why? After so long? Because, Sophie, sometimes in life it is easier to forget and move on than it is to make amends. And it wasn't until I heard the news that I realized how wrong I was... and how much I missed being a part of a family. So... were you ever close? - Hm? - Like, to getting married? - Were you ever close yourself? - [laughing] Oh, I mean, yeah, there were, there were a couple of guys. - Oh, yeah, I bet. - [laughs] I think I was just having too much fun. [laughing] Yeah, well... [gasps] Oh, my God, David. - [Jordyn] You scared me. - I'm sorry. - Uh, it's okay. - Uh, Soph. You mind if I talk to Jordyn alone for a minute? Yeah, sure. What is it? What's wrong? Phil Carson got the job. Wait. My job? Yeah, the one you applied for. Yeah. Well, who is he? He's just this guy in our IT department. Uh, you know, he's been there for years. I think Sharon told you that we're required to give our own employees first shot at a new position before we go to outside candidates. Sharon. She didn't even call me. Yeah, she was going to. Don't blame her. I, I told her not to. I thought it might be easier coming from me. Thanks. Yeah, David, you know, I... I think I wanna be alone for a bit. - If that's okay. - Yeah. Of course. Wait, David. Who did you say got the job? - [Jordyn] Phil Carlton? - Carson. - Carson. - [David] He's a nice guy. Not that that makes you feel any better. No. No, it doesn't. But, uh, it's good to know that the job went to someone who deserves it. Sorry. [dramatic music] [door shuts] [grunting] [screams] [laptop keys clacking] [dramatic music] [dramatic music] - Oh! - Are you kidding me? Uh... - Oh! - Oh. Oh. - I am so sorry. - Are you okay? - [chuckles] I am so sorry. - Oh. I was looking at a text message and I didn't... Whoa, t-take it easy. I mean, there's, uh... There's no use crying over spilled milk. I mean... You're funny. Okay, well, let's get you restocked, at least. You know, I may be clumsy, but I am not heartless. I am going to replace everything that I broke in these bags. No-no, there's no need to do that, girl. This-this was just an accident, right? - Accidents happen all the ti... - No, no, please. Please. Please. Let me. - Yeah. Yeah, o-okay. - Huh. [Jordyn] Wow! That is really interesting. [Phil] Right? Phil, uh, I just wanna let you know that I've never done this before. Oh, oh, well, we don't have to stay here if you don't want. - We can go get a coffee or a... - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. I want to stay. I really do. It's just, I... I don't want you to think that I'm one of those girls who, you know, goes home with guys she just met. - I would never think that. - Good. Yeah, 'cause it was just, you know, after what happened and then I saw that you were buying ingredients to make homemade guacamole. - [chuckles] - Which is crazy, right? I mean, like, who actually makes their own guac? - Yeah, and has their own recipe. - Right, right? That's how I knew you were okay. See, I don't, I don't know any mass murderers who make organic guacamole. [chuckling] Speaking of, we should go check out the guac shop. Um... So, Phil, what is it that you do? I see you have some amazing artwork. Must be something creative, I bet? Well, hardly, I just buy those paintings as I like collecting them, and, uh... And to be honest, I think they are gonna be valuable one day. - Oh. - But actually... I work at this, uh, really large real-estate brokerage firm. Really? How interesting. I mean, it's a job, I guess. I did just get a promotion, though, so that's a good thing. Well, we need to celebrate your promotion. - Do you have any wine? - Yeah. Yeah, I should. You know, I'm not a big drinker myself, but I always get a few bottles around Christmas time as gifts and... Oh, yeah, there it is. Will that do? Oh. That will do the trick. Mm, why don't you go pour us a couple of glasses? Good idea. [ominous music] [Jordyn] You know, they say, a person who drinks one to two glasses of wine a day lives on average five years longer than someone who doesn't. [chuckles] Really? [groans] [groans] Yup. But you don't need to worry about that. [dramatic music] [car alarm beeps] Do you wanna tell me what happened? Phil Carson is dead. Murdered. The guy that got the job that I wanted? What happened? Cops think it was a robbery gone bad. Did it happen at the office? No. No, it, uh... He never even came to work. Um, Sharon and HR knows who hadn't come in. She called him, he wasn't answering. That's not like him. So she called the police. They did a wellness check. And they found him on the floor, dead. Do they have any leads? Oh, my God. This is awful. I mean, I guess, uh, the cops think it was s-somebody he knew because there was no signs of forced entry and... I guess there was some valuable art that was missing. So, apparently, they knew exactly what to take. And how are you doing? I mean, I don't know. Well, it's... I've just got back to some sort of semblance of normalcy and then this? It's like... You know... I mean, I didn't, I didn't know the guy well. It's not like we were exactly friends, but... his death... - Oh, his death... - Shh. - Shh. - [sighs] I'm sorry. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. - No. - No, Jordyn, I can't do this. - Yes, you can. - N-no. Please. Look. Look, you're smart and beautiful and, God, you remind me of her. I have wanted this since the moment I saw you. I know you want it, too. I c-can't, I can't do this to her. She would understand. Let yourself feel human again. [door shuts] [Jordyn moans] Well, there's no way to say this other than... it's an incredibly irregular situation. And as tragic as it is, we need the position filled. And I'm happy to say that you're the most qualified candidate. Oh. Well, I will not disappoint you, Ms. Cooper. You can just call me Sharon. We're not that formal around here. And considering who recommended you, I have no doubt that you will be a valuable asset. Let me show you around. [laughing] - This is delicious. - He's right, David. It's amazing, but this was unnecessary. [David] Well, I think it's about time this family have something to celebrate, don't you? Yeah. So now that you've found a job, you want me to help you find a new place to stay? Oh, that's so sweet, and sounds like a lot of fun, but, um, your dad and I were talking and I think I might stay here a little bit longer, if that's okay with everyone. Yeah, Jordyn and I were just thinking, with her starting a new job, there's no reason for her to move. Besides, she's been such a huge help. So you've already decided this. Well, it's okay with you, right, Soph? Don't call me that. - What? - "Soph." Only my dad calls me that. And my mother. [David] Uh, look, why don't we, um, just enjoy our cake for now and we'll discuss it later? I don't know what there's left to discuss, dad. [David] Hey, kiddo, you wanna tell me what that was all about down there? What the hell are you doing? - Excuse me? - You heard me. Yeah, I heard you, but I don't appreciate the way you're talking to me right now. Now, look, I've let a lot of things slide over the past few weeks in light of everything, but you will stop acting like this. If there is something bothering you, talk to me. But you won't continue this behavior. Okay. You wanna know what's bothering me? Of course, I do. The fact that you found a replacement for our mother. Sophie, and that's ridiculous, and you know it. Yeah? Is it? First, you were just reconnecting with her because it was what mom would've wanted and then it was just helping her find a job and now she's staying here for God knows how long? She is not a member of this family, dad. Sophie, you are not the only one who is hurting here, okay? I know. I know that you and Noah lost your mother. And I know how terrible that is. I lost my wife. I lost my best friend and my partner. And no matter how much you kids hurt, that is something you can never understand. [scoffs] Oh, my God. You're sleeping with her. Aren't you? I... Look, I don't have to listen to this. I understand what you're going through, Sophie, but you will respect me. And you will respect your aunt. Do you understand? You didn't answer my question. - Hey. - Hey. - What are you doing for dinner? - Uh, well... Oh, it's late. Uh, I gotta text the kids. Uh, I could pick up pizza. How's that sound? David, you don't have to include me in everything that you guys do. This is gonna take adjusting for everyone. It's just pizza. Okay. I'm in. - Good. - Okay. [dramatic music] [cell phone beeps] [intense music] [door creaks] [music continues] [sighs] - [door creaks] - [gasps] [dramatic music] [door shuts] [gasps] Can I help you with something? Uh, I... [clears throat] I thought you were getting pizza with my dad. - He texted me. - He is. But I had some work that I needed to finish from home, so I told him I would meet him here. Um, I was just, um... I was, um... I have a date. Okay. And, and the necklace you gave me, the one that I liked so much, um, I was just seeing if you had anything else like it. I shouldn't have. I'm, I'm sorry, I... No problem. Yeah. A lot of kids dig through their mom's stuff, right? Here you go. This one. It'll be perfect for you. Hm. [crickets chirping] [dramatic music] [footsteps approaching] Mm. Oh. [chuckles] Tonight? - I want to. - But what? Look, it's just... With everything going on, I just can't. I, I'm not saying that we made a mistake, I'm just, I'm just saying e-everything's moving a little quickly. I thought you liked quickly. [David panting] [Luke] Sophie? Sophie! Sophie. Sophie. I don't know why you didn't tell me this earlier. 'Cause you wouldn't have believed me. - I might have. - But nobody else would've. Who was gonna believe me over some middle-aged woman? Still, you should've told me. I know, I know. But I was scared. She told me that she was gonna tell you that I forced myself on to her. And she swore she was gonna make you believe it. She was convincing. [scoffs] Yeah, I'm sure. - Are you mad at me? - Yes, I'm mad at you. I felt really bad about it. I still feel really bad about it. - [sighs] - Plus, I miss you. Then help me. Okay. Whatever it takes. Okay. Morning, dad. Uh, coffee ready? - Freshly brewed. - Cool. [David sighs] So what are you up to this weekend, sweetheart? No, I just got a lot of homework. Then I'm gonna hang around here and get some rest. - [footsteps approaching] - That sounds like a good idea. Hey, you two. Morning, Jordyn. - [David] What, are you leaving? - Yeah. Busy day. But I was thinking I could grab lunch for everybody. I'll be back around noon. I think that sounds nice. Just give her time. Okay. [dramatic music] [car engine starts] [line ringing] She's leaving. [music continues] [music continues] - [cell phone rings] - [gasps] Hey. Where are you? She pulled in to this apartment complex at Lake Bluff. Wait, what do you mean, "Pulled in?" She drove in, parked her car, walked inside. But you didn't follow her, did you? No. I'm not a moron. [scoffs] I'm out here waiting in my car. Is there a sign with a phone number on it outside? You know, for people who wanna rent, to call? Uh... [Luke] Sure is. [Sophie] Write it down. [Luke on phone] Okay. What do you want me to do now? If you can, stay there until she leaves. 10-4, partner. [dramatic music] [car engine starts] [music continues] [car engine rumbling] [music continues] [dramatic music] [sighs] [music continues] [cell phone beeps] [gasps] Hi, Sophie. U-um... I thought you were getting us lunch. I didn't know you wanted any. That's okay. Um... I'm gonna go get lunch with Luke, anyway. So that's back on again, huh? Excuse me? You and Luke. I don't see how that's any of your business. [scoffs] Mm, Sophie. I know I'm not your mother, but I have to tell you. I think it's a mistake you're dating that boy. He could be dangerous. For whom? Where's your dad? He's upstairs in his room. Sure you know where that is. [dramatic music] How did you convince this guy to meet with us? ce thisy Well, I told him who my Aunt Jordyn was and I said that I needed to speak with him, that it was important and very confidential. I still don't know why he agreed. Well, he's probably afraid that we have some information on him that could hurt his business. [Luke] Mm. [sighs] Okay. Just let me do the talking. Are you afraid I'm gonna say something stupid? Yes, I am. So just keep quiet, and I'm just gonna play it by ear, okay? Oh, don't worry about me. I'll just stand there and look pretty. - [laughs] - Stop. [Sophie] Okay. [Luke] After you. The last time I seen her was around a month or so ago. You didn't happen to see her just a few days ago, moving boxes out of her apartment? No. No, but I wouldn't be looking. She pay 300 a month. That's all I care about. You didn't happen to notice anything, um, I don't know, out of the ordinary going on? No, I, uh, never had any problems with them. W-wait, them? Ms. Robinson and her roommate. Wait, Jordyn had a roommate? Well, two of 'em lived there. Two of 'em were on a lease. You can call whatever you want. Um, do you happen to have the name of the woman who lived with her? You know, when you called me, you told me that this was important. Pardon me, but everything I seem to be telling you seems to be important to you. Um... Please, I... And it sounds like you want me to invade some lady's privacy. I'm just asking you for a favor. Okay? A favor that can help innocent people. Favor? Well... I'd be willing to do you a favor if you're willing to do one for me. Hey. You greasy son of a bitch. You're lucky we don't call the cops. Okay, Luke. Okay. Thank you for your time. Wait, I just, um... One more small thing. I just wanna make sure that this is her, that there are no mistakes. I, I took a photo of her driver's license. Yeah, that's her. That's the roommate. Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What? That's the woman who lived with Jordyn Robinson. Uh, no, this is Jordyn Robinson. This is my aunt. It says so right there. I don't care what your photo says or what the license says, that is not Jordyn Robinson. [sighs] Okay. Um... Thank you. Come on. [man on TV] A nine-year-old metro girl has a new lease on life, thanks to surgery at the hospital for sick children. [David] Hey, kiddo. Hey. Where's everyone else? Uh, well, I, um, I told Noah to, uh, eat at Myles' place and asked Jordyn if she can give me some time alone with you. I thought, uh, I don't know, I thought we could have dinner together. Dad, what's this about? I know. I know. I got it, I got it. Your mother was always better at thOkay. Um... thing. Look. We need to have a talk about Luke. Let me guess. Jordyn said something. - Didn't she? - She cares about you, Sophie. I, I know that's hard for you to accept, but she does. Dad, are you just completely oblivious or do you have your head stuck up your ass? No. No, no, no. No, you do not talk to me like that. - Do you hear me? - Or what? What, are you gonna send your little whore to have a nice, little talk with me? Okay. All right. You know what? I thought we could talk about this like adults, apparently, we can't. Fine. Be that as it may. Listen to me. You are not going to see Luke anymore, do you understand me? I still haven't decided how I'm gonna pursue this. Pursue what? Luke made some inappropriate advances towards Jordyn. It's bad. Do you understand what I'm saying? We're talking about going to the police. Are you serious, dad? You are not going to see Luke anymore. This is not a negotiation. He is dangerous. That's the deal. Do you understand? - Okay. Yeah. - Sophie. Soph... Sophie, w-when you get older, you'll know that we're just doing what's best for you. Me and your aunt. [cell phone beeping] [ine ringing] Tomorrow morning. You ready? Great. I'll see you then.

We have some evidence. No. What evidence do we have? I mean, the only thing I have is a picture of someone's license and some crazy story about someone impersonating my aunt. Well, the cops could work with it. [Sophie] No. You know, the first thing they would do is go to my father. And she has him so completely whipped that they'd just turn it around on me and make it look like I was the crazy one. We need something that there is no way she can deny or spin. Okay. I just hope we find it really quick. Then what are we waiting for? [instrumental music] [car engine rumbling]e rum] Okay. You ready? Are you sure you don't wanna come back here when it's dark? No. That's gonna be even more suspicious. Plus, I don't wanna wait that long. Let's just go and act like we're supposed to be here, and everything's gonna be okay. - Okay? - All right. [intense music] [Sophie sighs] [Sophie] Ready? Okay. It's right down here. Okay. This is the hallway that I lost her down. Well, 222. Okay? [Sophie] Okay. - Okay. - Take it easy. I think. Okay, okay, okay. - There's, uh... - 245. And 222. - Okay. - Did you bring the flashlights? Uh, yeah. - One for you. Yeah. - Thank you. One for me. - You ready? - Yeah. [Sophie sighs] [music continues] So what are we looking for? [Sophie] I don't know, Luke. Anything with an official name on it. Anything that doesn't say Jordyn Robinson. [clattering] Wouldn't she have gotten rid of this storage unit? No. I don't think so. I think she needed, like, financial records, things like that. If she wanted to get rid of them, she wouldn't have the storage. Okay. Hey, wait. There's something back there. Here, help me move this. Right. And this. - [Sophie grunts] - [Luke] Here. [Sophie] Move that. Okay. [Sophie] Ah! Oh, God! Oh! [Luke] Sophie! Come on, let's get out of here! [sobbing] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yo, baby, look! Look! Look at me! Look at me! You're gonna be okay. Okay? You're gonna be okay. [sobbing] Oh, my God! Was that your aunt? Your real one? I don't know. I don't know, but it must be. [sobbing] Oh, my God! No, it can't be her. - I, I need to call my dad. - Your dad? - Yes. - Okay. [cell phone ringing] Hey, honey. Can you get these to Trevor? - [Sophie on phone] Dad. - Soph, what's wrong? - [David] You okay? - I'm fine, I'm fine. But I, I need you to get home, dad. I need to talk to you right away. Honey, I'm really swamped right now. What... Can this wait till I get home, please? Dad, it can't wait! It's a matter of life or death. Honey, calm down. What's going on? She's not who you think she is, dad. We found the real Aunt Jordyn. She's dead! [Sophie on phone] The fake Jordyn killed her. [David] What? Jordyn... Jordyn killed somebody? Okay. Relax. Don't tell me to relax! I'm not gonna relax! You need to get home now. I will prove it to you. Please, just call the cops, dad. [David] Okay. Calm down. I'm... I'll, I'll come home. Okay. - He's coming? Okay. - He's coming. Okay. Just get me home in one piece. Okay? Hey, Jordyn. I... What are you doing? Making sure my dad understands. [cell phone beeps] [dramatic music] Oh, my God. Ellie, uh, uh, call the police. Call the police! Call them right now! Tell them to get to my house! My daughter's in trouble. - I should come with you. - No. If my father sees you here, he'll think you had something to do with all this. I need to convince him. - Are you sure? - Yeah. You're amazing. Okay. Get out of here. - Call me once everything's okay. - Okay. - Hi, Luke. - [gasps] [intense music] [doorknob clicks] Sophie? I know you're in here. It's better if you tell me where you are. Sophie? [Jordyn] Sophie! Last chance, Sophie. - [screams] - [grunts] [indistinct yelling] [groaning] Ow! Ow! [Jordyn] You couldn't let it go, could you? [Sophie groans] Now it's your turn to die! [groans] [groans] [panting] [choking] All I wanted was a family, Sophie. Oh, it's the one thing Jordyn and I didn't have. You know, she used to talk about you, about her sister's family, about how she messed up. Well, she wanted to reconnect, to say she was sorry. Yeah. But then, your mother died and she lost her chance. [whispers] But I still have mine. And then you had to go and ruin everything. Ruin everything because I would've made a great mother! Jordyn? [gasps] Jordyn! [Sophie grunting] Sophie! Sophie? [clanking] Oh, my God. Dad? Soph. [David] Oh, my God. [indistinct radio chatter] Officer, I really can't remember anything. You might have a mild concussion, so you need to take it easy for a few days. Dad, get her to the general practitioner. You're gonna be okay. Thank you. Dad... just promise me one thing. Anything. Promise me that we don't have any more long-lost relatives. [sobbing] Well, come here. Um... [sobbing] [David] I love you so much.
