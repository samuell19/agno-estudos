[MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL] [DOORBELL] MONA: Dammit, Jim. There's somebody at the door. [DOORBELL] -Hello, Mr. Carlton. -Hello, Candy. -Why are you here tonight? -Mrs. Carlton asked me to come. -Hm, that's funny. I'll go ask her. Candy Wilson's downstairs. -What for? -I don't know. She said you asked her to come tonight. -But we don't need her tonight. She's made a mistake. -But I was thinking, as long as she is here, why don't we take advantage of it-- go out to dinner? -What? -You know, do something together-- have dinner, be together. -You know I've been planning this for a week-- almost two weeks. Here, help me with my coat. -You could call your mother, and you and Mike could go down in the morning. -No. I'm going. -Why? Do you know how long it's been since we've been together? It's been months. We're always apart. We're going in different directions all the time. Now this is a perfect chance. -Look, mother will have dinner planned. And you know how she's looking forward to seeing Michael. I don't want to disappoint her. -How about me? She could afford to lose a few hours. -We spend months together when all I can get is a grunt out of you, because you've got your nose stuck in some script. Now I've got something I want to do. You want me to drop everything, go someplace with you? Well, that's not fair, and I'm not going to do it. -OK. Stop dramatizing. Why in the hell shouldn't I work all the time? I can't talk to you anymore. You take so many pills. You're in a daze. It's like talking to a stump. -Stop it! Oh, let's not argue. You're making me nervous. Here, take my bag downstairs. -Nervous? Dammit, Mona. -Please, stop it! -There's been a mix up, so we don't need you. Sorry. -Oh, that's OK, Mr. Carlton. -Candy, I'm so sorry you came all the way over here for nothing. -It happens sometimes. Hi, Mike. -Hi, Candy. -Will you please help me with the car? I'm running awfully late. Come on, Mike. Let's go. Bye, Candy. -I don't know what the big rush is all about. -Wait for me. When I get back, I'll pay you, so it won't be a total loss. -You don't have to do that. -Wait for me. I'll be right back. Drive carefully, honey, and say hello to your mom for me. Bye-bye, Michael. -Bye, Daddy. -We'll be back sometime the first part of the week. -Mona, dammit. Baby. -You'll feel better when I get back. Bye, Jim. CANDY: What does "MOS" mean? -What? -What does it mean in a script when they write "MOS"? -Oh, well, believe it or not. That means without sound. -Without sound? -Yeah, there used to be this old German director, you see. Every time he wanted to shoot without sound-- you know, silent footage-- he'd say [GERMAN ACCENT] "dis ve shoot mithout sound"-- MOS. -Hey, that's really wild. -Yeah, the gag stuck, and now it's used every place. What's the matter? -Well, it's really none of my business, but I think they should use MOS more often when they make movies. -That's interesting. You think they ought to go back to silent pictures? -Why not, when they're going to write stuff like this for people to say? Like this. -You really turn me on. We should make the scene together sometime. What's the matter with that? -Oh, brother, you're kidding. -No, I'm not. Tell me what's wrong. -Nobody talks that way. -Hippies do. You know, long-hairs, young people, younger people. -Nobody talks that way. -Well, I didn't write it. -I'm sorry. Forget it. -I'm just supposed to direct the picture. It starts in two weeks. -Lots of luck. -What are we supposed to do-- hire a teenager to write our shooting scripts? -Look at this. Do you think it's the kind of life we can really dig, Frank? And how about this-- the firelight reflected in their eyes symbolized the passionate that inflamed them? -Don't go. -I wasn't leaving Mr. Carlton. I just thought you might like a martini. -Good idea. The gin's to the left of the sink. Use the Tanqueray and put it on the rocks! Well, thank you very much. It's a good martini. How old are you, Candy? -Does it matter? -Well, no, I guess it doesn't. -What's the matter with having a teenage writer? -Well, why not? There's got to be some way to make contact. -Is that what you want? To make contact? -Well, we've got to do something. -If you really mean it, we're going out. -Out? Where? -There's something big and new going on out there, and it's-- I don't know-- it's different. And if you want to understand it, you've got to really go out and look at it-- really look at it. -Let's go. -Mona really did ask you to come tonight, didn't she? -Yes, but that was a week ago Wednesday. She probably forgot. She doesn't seem to pay much attention to anything lately. -Come on in. Have a drink. Uh, Sancho scotch and soda for Mrs. Carlton. Is that OK, Mona? -Just ice water will be fine. -Turn off the TV. Now, go on. Get out of here. Go upstairs. Mrs. Carlton doesn't like to look at junkies. -Don't call him that. -Sure. I'm sorry. Forget it. Come on. Sit down. Sancho, where's that drink? Well, it's been a few months since last time. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, you guys, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine-- Jim Carlton. This is A.K. And this is Snitch. -Hey, man. -And that's Mary Mary. -Groovy. -Since you're with Candy, man, you're-- you're truly one of us. I sense you're truly one of us. How would you like to [INAUDIBLE] a round of beers? -I don't know why I didn't think of it myself. Miss? Miss? -No, her name's Winona. But she responds better to a good whistle. [WHISTLES] -Did you bring it? -Yes. -All of it? -Every cent. -Ten grand feels pretty good in one hand, doesn't it? Hey, tell me, how do you get so much money without your husband knowing about it. -That's none of your business. -I know, I just thought I'd ask. Hey, put this away, will you? And clean that ashtray. This place would be a pigsty if I didn't watch every minute. -Look, I have to get back to my mother's. Michael's there. Now where's the stuff? -Why are you in such a rush? We're not through yet. -What are you talking about? You've got the money. I don't understand what you're talking about. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Things have changed. It's not enough. Come on. Sit down over here. -Not enough? But our agreement. -Sit down. I'm not talking about money. -Then what are you talking about? -I want to use your boat. -You're crazy. That's Jim's boat. Now what in the world do you-- -You get the picture. -No way, Rich. Don't involve me in your business. -We've done business for years. And I've never asked you for a favor. You're my only retail customer, and I always made sure that you got a standard, quality product. Now I'm in a jam. Why don't you help me? -Forget it. You're asking too much. -Gotta have that boat. -No. -How long since you've had a fix? -Oh no, I'm fine. I'm fine. -Sancho, come here. Hang on to that. -What are you doing, Rich? -I'm taking you off, junkie. -Don't call me that. -Junkie, you're a hop-head. You're a needle freak. Now look, just because you don't have to steal to pay for it, you're no better than the rest of them, baby. I'm going to go pick up Doris. Have a few drinks. Keep her here. And don't let her go near her purse. -Wait, Rich, you can't do this. -Oh, yes I can, Miss [INAUDIBLE] Rich Bitch. I can do it. And I'm going to love doing it. [INAUDIBLE] By the time I get back here, you're going to want to kiss me. -Rich. -Mary Mary, huh? How'd you ever end up with two names? -Ta-da. -We, uh, figured one name wouldn't be enough to cover both of her. -I see what you mean. -Hey, Snitch, is there anything new on the floor? -Well, why don't we go and find out? -Cool. Should you lead or should I? -I will. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hey, man, are you making it with Candy? -Wait a minute, now. I want you to understand something. -Hey, hey don't get uptight. It's a friendly question. Let me tell you something, baby. That little chick has an [INAUDIBLE] you dig? I mean there are cats in here follow her around like with their tongue caught in their belt buckle, and nothing. So if she picked up on you, it's because she digs you. And if she digs you, we dig you. Dig? -Yeah, OK. -Oh wow, is that great? Come on. You gotta try it. -Oh, come on. I can't do that. -Listen, contact starts with music. Come one. [MUSIC PLAYING] Don't work so hard. Let the music get into you. Don't just listen to it. Feel it. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'm frightened. -How much time do you have? -I don't really know, but I don't want to go more than an hour. You'll help me, won't you? -No, Mrs. Carlton, not a chance. Don't build up your hopes. If he gets the boat, he'll take care of things. -But I can't take a chance like that with Jim's boat. -Don't worry about the boat. I know about boats. -But if we're caught. -I've been running boats up from Mexico since I was 12 years old. Started out by smuggling lobsters. Lobsters-- you believe that? I know every foot of water between here and Cabo San Lucas and every cop. And that's why Harris needs me. -But why? What happened to his contacts? -He's done a stupid thing. He made a sale when he had nothing to sell. Then he made hasty arrangements with our people in Mexico. The buy was made, but everybody knows about it on both sides of the border. Some arrests have been made. The motorist goes. He must pick it up by sea before it is confiscated. If it is destroyed, he is a dead man. -Do you care? -Yes. He makes us a lot of money. I need a lot of money. -But why? You're not a-- -A junkie? I'm sorry, but that's what they call it. You're a junkie, Mrs. Carlton. And so am I. Now let's be just that. -But you're clean. -Sure, but it's a day to-day proposition. -I couldn't do that. -Other people have. [MUSIC PLAYING] -It's just a matter of honesty, A.K. We can't make pictures about people who aren't there. The good guys don't exist anymore, mainly the bad guys. We try to take people, words put them together and make an honest picture. Most of us just don't know how. -Well, you stick around, baby, and we'll lay it on you. -Hey, man, you got any bikes in this picture? -Oh sure, lots of them. -No more of the Hell's Angels stuff, huh? I mean, like, it's out. Look at me. I'm a biker, and I took a bath today. -That's right, man. And you know I even brush my teeth. Now this may tarnish my image, (WHISPERING) but I got to tell you, I got on clean underwear. -Say, [INAUDIBLE] -He was about to say that everybody that rides bikes doesn't go around beating up old ladies. -I never thought they did. -Baby, we got a place down in Seaview that you've got to see. Mary Mary owns it, and me and Snitch run it for her. It's kind of a motorcycle race track, you know? And every weekend we got cats coming in there with their bikes from everywhere. -Oh man, you got to see some of those bikes. -OK, when? -Well, what are you doing tomorrow? -I'm going down to Seaview with you, right? -We're going to tune you in into what's happening. -Groovy. -Now, this here is called a joint. J-O-I-N-T. Joint. Now, it may look like an ordinary cigarette, but I can guarantee you there ain't no lung cancer in this little brain suppository. -Yeah, but aren't you afraid of getting busted? -Well, not if you cool it. Not if you cool it. Listen, Jim. Don't worry about this stuff being illegal. I mean, it was made that way by the same cats who used to say tomatoes were poisonous. Now, since you're the guest of honor, and its an old custom, you get the first hit. -Come on, man. Bang away. -My god, man. No, not that way. You just blew away enough gas to put us all around the block. -I'm sorry. I didn't know that you weren't-- -It's cool, man. It's cool. Really cool. Come here. You just need a little instruction. Now you watch old A.K. here. First thing you've got to do is take a very heavy drag, dig? Then you just hold it in, you see? You hold it, and you hold it, and you hold it, till you can't hold it no more. Then you let it out. [INAUDIBLE] Now, try it again. Try again, man. Go ahead. JIM: Like this? -Beautiful man. You're on. Beautiful, beautiful. And now what you do is you just pass it over to Candy Candy there. And then Candy Candy pass it on to Mary Mary, and then Mary Mary to A.K. A.K ., and then to Snitch Snitch, and then to Jim Jim, and then to Candy Candy, and then do do do do do do do. You can let it out now, man. I mean, we don't want you to pass out or anything. You dig? JIM: Man. -Look at him, man. He's hungry for it again already. -You'll burn your fingers. -Why don't you ash it? Here it goes. -Yeah, I just did. -Beautiful. Lovely. I now pronounce you one us, my man. -Groovy. -I don't feel anything. [LAUGHTER] A.K.: You will. [SOBBING] [INAUDIBLE] -Please. -So Mrs. Carlton. -Oh God. -Relax. -I'm dying. I'm dying! I hurt all over. [INAUDIBLE] -Yeah, come on. Cry. Cry. Hold on to me. Concentrate on my fist. Try to keep thinking it won't be long. Easy. Easy. [DOOR CLOSING] -Oh, would you look at that, Doris? The pretty junkie and the nice Mexican boy. What are you doing, Sancho? Are you lining a little something up for later? -That's enough, Rich. -Hey, you watch your mouth. I don't like to pay $500 a week to some smart ass greaser. [SOBBING] -What about her? -Why don't you look for yourself? -How do you feel, junkie? -Rich. Oh, Rich. Oh, God, I'm dying. Give it to me! Hurry. -What about the boat? -You can have the boat. You can have anything. Just give me a fix. -But what about you, because I want you on that boat too. -You've got me too. Just help me, please! -OK. All right. -Take it easy. It's over now. -No. No. Not there. Right there. -OK, everybody, let's get to bed. We've got to get up early in the morning. You, Mona, call your mother. JIM: [SINGING] She danced the fandango on my cousin's turn. That doesn't rhyme at all. And then she danced the fandango on her perm. She burned. And then she danced the fandango on her turn. -Mr. Carlton, we're home. -Home! -You'll wake the neighbors. -Home? That's out of sight. How do you say that-- out of sight? Very good, Jim. Grand. To hell with the neighbors! They're all philistines and moneychangers. That one over there is a psychiatrist. And that one over there is a banker. And they both make a living telling lies. -Come on. -Philistines-- -Come on. - --and moneychangers, all of them! And do you know what movie producers are? They're also philistines and moneychangers. They're little men with steel-rimmed glasses who are always telling you how much sex to put in your picture. You know? -Yeah. -And [INAUDIBLE] neighbors. Would you please? Thank you. I've been reborn. Look, my apricot fag shoes. Thank you. Mona bought them. And on the other hand. I mean to tell you about the plot. Was it movie producers? -Mm-hm. -Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money. [INAUDIBLE] and money. Take very good care of the shirt, please, because it's terribly expensive. -All right. -There you go. Also, I would like to say one other little thing. -What? -I always have trouble getting my pants off, because I don't know whether I get them off first, or the socks second, or how it works. -Let me help you. -Oh, thank you. Been a long day. Been a long day, and I've been reborn. Everybody calls me James Carlton, including movie producers and the Infernal Revenue-- Infernal Internal Revenue. But because you are now my friend-- my very good friend-- you may henceforth call me Jim. Please repeat after me, Jim. -Jim. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Hi there. -Mr. Carlton aboard? -Mrs. Carlton-- she is -Sure is a nice day. -Good morning, Smitty. SMITTY: Well, good morning, Mrs. Carlton. Nice to see you again. -Thank you. -How's Mr. Carlton? Oh, he's fine. Um, he's been very busy lately. -Have a good day. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CLOSING] -Good morning. -Hi. How do you want your coffee? -Black. Were you here all night? -Yeah, I hope it's OK. It was pretty late last night. -It's fine with me. Won't somebody be worried about you-- your folks maybe? -Everything's cool. I called the kids I live with. -May I ask what you're doing? -I'm doing a cheese omelette with green onions. -Sounds great. Is that part of the service too? -Part of the service. -Boy, you were sure stoned last night. -Oh boy, was I out of line. -Well, when we got up to the bedroom, you gave me big kiss. -Candy, now I want to explain something to you. -And then you fell asleep, and I came down to the guest room. -You know, last night is the first time in a long time that I've felt hope and relaxed. Do you know what I mean? -Free. -Free-- that's a good word, isn't it? -You and Mrs. Carlton don't really have much going, do you? -No, we just kind of move around each other. We don't say much. -Mona. Poor Mona. She used to be a damned good actress. I don't know what's happened to her. She started showing up late at the studio, didn't know her lines. Then she started fighting with the director and the crew, and pretty soon she didn't get any work anymore. Of course, then I got busy and was away a lot. And when I was there, there wasn't much communication. Maybe she needs to be turned on to people like A.K. and Snitch and you. -Do you still want to go to the motocross? -The what? -They're the bike races down in Seaview. Remember, A.K. asked you last night? -Oh, sure. Why not? -Do you feel all right? -Yeah, I feel fine. -No hangover, right? -No. No, I feel great. -Let's eat. [INAUDIBLE] All right, let out this to give it gas. Gas? Gas. Let out this easy. OK? Gas. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] -Yeah. OK! I'll follow you. ANNOUNCER: [INAUDIBLE] Please stand by. You have five minutes. [MUSIC PLAYING] RICH: Hey, Sancho, Come on down. How far south are we? -Oceanside. -Take her out about 20 miles, then cut south again. I don't want to get into Mexico water till after dark. -That's no good. If somebody sees us zigzagging on their radar-- look bad. This way we are tourists only on vacation. -OK, we'll do it your way. You know, this guy Carlton serves second-rate scotch. But at least it's scotch. -I'll build a fire, if you'll be the bartender. -I'll do that. -I think it's been a great day. Don't you Wild, [INAUDIBLE] exciting-- you were right, you know? A different world-- it's what I needed. You know those guys are crazy? Yeah, but isn't everybody in their own way? -Yeah, I guess so. They're kind of special, though. They're like-- those guys would jump off the cliff and not go cuckoo. They're like skydivers. -What do you do that's crazy? -What do I do? -Yeah. -Sure you won't tell anybody? -Promise. -I talk to myself. -Do you really talk to yourself? -Sure. I do it all the time. -What do you talk about? -Well, sometimes when I'm in the shower, when I'm shaving, driving the car I talk about-- you know what I mostly talk about is my boat. -Well, what do you-- your boat. What about your boat? -Well, I guess it's a symbol to me. I feel safe. I feel protected when I'm in that boat. And I feel like I'm away from all the other things that bug me every day. -What's the boat like? -The one I have is a 42-foot Marquis The one I'd like, oh, it changes from time to time, but it's big enough to take me around the world. It's maybe a return to the womb kind of a thing that I guess a lot of us have. But it's tight. It's cozy. And it's warm. And it's dark. And I know where everything is in there, you know? -What do you do that's crazy? -Um, well, it depends on what someone would consider crazy. A lot of people think when I stare at them that I'm crazy or rude or something. But that's just what I like to do. I get my enjoyment out of staring at people and watching their reactions -Have you-- have you ever been caught looking into people's eyes? Do they ever catch you? -Sure, all the time, because I make it so obvious. I don't try to hide it. -Doesn't it embarrass you? -No, because that's what I do. And if people don't like it, then what can I say? You can always tell if someone's angry at you, or if someone loves you. You can just look in their eyes, and you can tell. You know, so I just love watching people. -Will you have dinner with me? -Of course. -All right. -I'm not really hungry. -I'll fix the fire. -We don't need a fire, do we? -No. -Why don't you stretch out? Feel good. [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC PLAYING] -I want to see the firelight on your body. [MUSIC PLAYING] -If they're not on time, they've never find us. -They damn well better find us. -Let me know when you sight the boom. Otherwise, you and Leon stay up here. -This fog's going to be pea soup in another hour. -Let's go topside and use our eyes. -Our little tester's all ready. Aren't you honey? -As soon as our Mexican friends get here, you'll be the first to try the merchandise. You'll like that. -OK, [INAUDIBLE] -You stay Leon. You'll enjoy this. Sancho will keep watch. -Oh, it's good. [MUSIC PLAYING] JIM (VOICEOVER): Tomorrow I'm going to take you to a very special place. CANDY (VOICEOVER): Is it very special? JIM (VOICEOVER): I've never taken anyone there before. CANDY (VOICEOVER): Where is it? JIM (VOICEOVER): It's very high and very cold and very quiet. CANDY (VOICEOVER): Let's go there now. JIM (VOICEOVER): The first thing in the morning. Right now we're going to sleep very close. CANDY (VOICEOVER): Right now is all there is. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You look pretty good in Mona's clothes. -They're a little roomy. -You know, I've had this place a long time, but I've never been able to get her to come up here. -I hate to leave here and go back and face all the realities again. -That's not until tomorrow. Maybe I'm selfish, but I don't want to think about your wife or how the flight back will be or your problems at the studio. -I'm sorry. -No, don't be sorry. Just be with me now. -I am with you. -I want all of you. And I want the mountains and the snow and the fresh air and the smell of smoke from a chimney. You said that today was your gift to me, and I don't want to share it with anybody-- just you. -You make me feel so important. -But you are important. -Right now you're all that life is. -That's what I said-- right now. There is no other time or place. -I love you. -I know. -I'm calling Jim-- Jim Carlton. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Do you have the number? -661-0361. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): 0361. Mr. Jim Carlton, please, this is the marine operator. He's not answering. Just a moment. We don't have a location for him. Is there a message? -Let me speak to the exchange operator. OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Go ahead, Shalamar. -This is Mona Carlton. Would you take a message? Tell him I'm on the Shalamar with some friends. Tell him everything's fine and not to worry. EXCHANGE OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Uh, yes, Mrs. Carlton. Anything else? -Have her call your mother. -Would you please call my mother in Newport Beach? Give her the same message. Do you have the number? EXCHANGE OPERATOR (ON PHONE): Uh, yes-- 398-0431. -Yes, thank you. Good night. Will you keep your hands off me? You've got what you want. -Listen, you hotshot junkie, you know I'm the only thing between you and hell. -Oh, go roll around with Doris. Just leave me alone. -Rich, what's happening? Come on to bed. -Sure, honey. And I've-- I've got a present for you. DORIS: OK, but hurry. -Now you and me are going to go down there and show her a good time. And anything she wants, she gets. You're going to be the star. And you better be good. -I can't do that. -You're an actress. You make people believe anything. Here's your surprise, Doris. And she tells me she's ready for you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Doris. [MOANING] -Oh, god, it's morning. -Boy, are you a beaut. Stay right there. Come on, baby. Upper time. -Thanks. -Sure, baby. Anytime. Leon, get down here. -Hey, wait a miunte, Let me get something on. -Leon. -Morning, Mr. Harris. -She asleep? -Yes, sir I guess so. -Like hell. What little goody did she pay you off with? -No, sir, I didn't touch her. -Why, you little punk. If you weren't a lousy nigger junkie, you might be big enough to be a black man. Get up there. Help Sancho with the anchor. Doris, baby, could you fix me some breakfast? -Let me. I better call the office and let them know where I am. -0361. -Hello, this is Jim Carlton. I guess my wife isn't home. -Apparently not, Mr. Carlton. No one picked up the phone. -Well, she's probably not back yet. Listen, call my office, will you, and tell my secretary I'll be in sometime this afternoon. Any calls for me? -There was a call from the Shalamar through the San Pedro Marina operator. -My boat? When? -That was Sunday at 9:30 PM. -You mean last night? Well, that's funny. What was the message. All right. Thank you very much. She didn't say who she was with, huh? Anything else? U.S. Customs? Did they say what they wanted? OK, thank you. -Mm, you smell good in the morning. -Please, Candy, not-- not right now. -Well, I could eat a side of beef. What is it, Jim? What's wrong? -Well, I just found out that my wife is out on my boat with some friends. -So, what's the matter with that? -Pretty funny, I haven't been able to get her on that boat for the last two years. Now all of a sudden-- I just don't understand. -Don't worry about it. She's probably out there having a ball. Kiss me. Are you mad at your wife because she's out on the boat? -Well, yeah. She lied to me. She told me she was going down to her mother's for the weekend. Well, how the hell do I know she isn't out with some guy? -I think it's time to go. -Candy, please understand that I didn't mean to-- -Please, Jim. Let's go. -Candy, I'm sorry about what happened back there. -Don't be sorry. -All of a sudden it hit me. I was being jealous of my wife. And then I looked at you. I feel like such a bastard. -No, you're not. You're just a man. -You're a strange girl in many ways, Candy. After being with you, I just don't know. I just-- -Don't say anymore, please. -Do you think, I mean-- do you think you'll want to stay with Michael once in a while? -Sure. Why not? -Well, I thought maybe that-- -Don't make a big thing out of this. It's very simple. We picked up on each other, and we swung. And now it's too heavy for both of us. So don't worry about it. I've been there before, OK? -OK. -If you want me in the next couple of days, I'll be at the Raceway with Mary Mary and the guys. -I'll call you. -Yeah, do that. -Good morning, Karen. -Good morning. -Morning, Cathy. -Good morning. -Good morning, Susan. -Good morning, Mr. Carlton. -Well, Smitty, what brings you up to the big city? Oh, I had to come up and get some radio part and a couple other things. -Good to see you. Is everything all right? -Yeah, yeah. Uh, look, could I talk to you in there for a minute? -Sure. Sure, come on. Hold the calls for a minute, will you Sue? Yes, sir. Sit down, Smitty. What can I do for you? -Well, I'll tell you, Mr. Carlton. There's-- there's something screwy going on down at the harbor, and-- and I thought you ought to hear about it. -Kind of screwy-- what? -Well, I guess you know Mrs. Carlton took out the Shalamar last Saturday morning. -Yes, I know. I don't suppose you know who was with her, do you? -No, a couple guys I never seen before. -What else? -Well, anyway, yesterday-- I guess it was about noon-- these cops show up to office and start asking questions about some boats, and one of them was the Shalamar. -The police? -Yes, sir, and they weren't just police either. They was treasury men. -And they were asking about my boat? -Let me tell you what those guys did. They were asking about eight other boats besides the Shalamar. And as them boats come in, they searched every damned one of them. -They searched them? -And that ain't all. I was talking to a guy yesterday, come up from Coronado, he said they was doing the same thing down there. -Smitty, when you saw my wife Saturday morning, did you talk to her? -Yes, sir. Said good morning. Good to see her again. -Did she say anything about where she was going or what she was going to do? -No. Look, Mr. Carlton, I-- I've known you for a long time, and if there's anything wrong-- -Smitty, how would you like to take a little airplane ride? -Oh, not too hot on airplanes. -Come on. Don't worry about it. I want you to help me find the Shalamar. [MUSIC PLAYING] If the boats in the marina, it'll be hard to spot. I got a hunch they're out in the channel, or anchored by themselves somewhere. -Only sailboats. -We used to anchor in that cove a lot. -Are they here? -Hey, Morgan, send somebody over to pick up the stuff. -Sorry, baby, no go. You're too hot. No boats can get in anywhere without a search, and that goes for us. -What about my stuff? -Shove it, baby, or dump it over. I don't care. I just came out here to tell you to keep away from us. I can't even use the radio. -There are two boats out there-- both cabin cruisers-- about two miles offshore. -You can't do this to me, Morgan. I got people waiting. -Man, that's your problem. We're all in big trouble. That cuts it. We're getting out of here. -Morgan. Morgan! Morgan! -What do you think's going on down there? -I'll tell you what. We sure scared off that [INAUDIBLE] craft. -Scared him off? -He sure hightailed it for someplace. -You know that boat. -If it's the one I think it is, there's only one around like her. Can we take another look? JIM: You bet. -Hey, Rich. -Leon, get a blanket and some towels. -Yep, that's her all right. She's called The Easy Going. Except there ain't nothing easy about her. I worked on her engines once. She'll do 35 knots, flat out. -You know the owner? -Yep, belongs to some investment company up in LA. -Well, the greaser is now a big hero with his own private little junkie. Look, I don't pay you all that bread to swim around collecting broads. -Why don't you just shut up and get out of the way? -Where the hell do you think you're going? -I'm heading for shore. -I didn't tell you where to go. -I didn't ask you. -Who the hell do you think is running this show? -I am. I just took over. -Yeah, well, I've got news for you. -Now, you listen. You haven't done anything right since you got on this boat. We're almost out of fuel. The Coast Guard is looking for us, and that airplane wasn't exactly playing games either. [INAUDIBLE] -Rich, I know what I'm doing. They're going to [INAUDIBLE] us here by Seaview. We'll go ashore there. -Get away from that wheel. Get away from that wheel. [MUSIC PLAYING] MONA: Oh my god. Rich, no! -You're going to call the Coast Guard? -We have plenty of time to do that. I want to take another look at my boat first. -What are you doing? I'm going to put this boat on the beach. -On the beach? But you'll sink it if you try that. -I don't give a damn. -You want to kill us too? -She's right. The stuff's no good to us if we're dead. -Shut up, you junkies. I don't listen to junkies. -I may be a junkie, Rich, but I'm no fool. I know that old pier. Let me take it in. -I'm giving the orders around here. Now you take this boat, put it up on that pier just like Sancho said. -They're headed for that pier. They'll wreck the boat if they hit those pilings. Seaview UNICOM, this is Cherokee 46 Whiskey, over. UNICOM (ON RADIO): 46 Whiskey, go ahead. -We'll be landing in three minutes. Will you please call the Seaview Raceway? Ask for Candy Wilson. Tell her I need some wheels and some people right away. If she asks any questions just tell her that Jim Carlton's in trouble. UNICOM (ON RADIO): Roger, 46. Do you have an emergency? -Negative. Please give me runway and traffic advisory. -Jimbo, what's the trouble, man? -Thanks for coming, guys. Can you take me down to the old pier? I'll explain on the way. -Sure, let's go. -Hop on, man. We're picking up some more guys. -Hey, shouldn't I call the sheriff? -Sure, you do that. Give me about a half an hour, though. I got lots of help here. [MUSIC PLAYING] -No. [GRUNTING] -Hey. -No! [GRUNTING] No. No. No. Get off of me. -Hash, man. Hash. Mother hashish is amongst us. Woo! Take care, brother. -No. Leon! Leon! I'll give you [INAUDIBLE] Leon! [LAUGHTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ciao, baby.
