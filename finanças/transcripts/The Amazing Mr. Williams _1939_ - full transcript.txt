Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes - Bring me an old-fashion, please. - Yes, Miss. - And don't make it too old-fashioned. - I understand, Miss. - Darling, I'm awfully sorry. - ...but I got held up. Well, you wouldn't want me to come with blood on my clothes. How about some chicken soup? Two chicken soups. Honestly, I should have my head examined. The world is full of nice, normal men and I become engaged to a crazy cop. Darling, I wish you wouldn't keep referring to me as a cop. I'm a grade A detective, homicide squad. It's a vastly different thing. - Steak or fish? - Fish. Fish. It's an impossible kind of a life to ask any woman to lead. I never know where you are, or when. It isn't as if it paid anything to make it worthwhile. I wish you'd tell Captain McGovern that. And what if we do get married? What about the children? When they ask me, "Where's Poppa?", what am I going to say? Just say I slipped out for a minute. Oh, I do wish you'd be serious, Kenny. - You have a good background... - Chef's salad? Yeah... A Law School education. A certain amount of brains. Why didn't you pick something with a future? - Something with a little more dignity. - Yes, you're absolutely right, darling. I'll take it up with you the first thing in the morning. In the meantime this is your evening and I'm not going to let anything spoil it. - Boiled onions? - Yes. - Do you hear what I hear. - It's only the wind. It is not! It's a police car after you. Kelly, go in there and get Williams. Tell him to get out here pronto. Lieutenant, there's been a murder uptown at the Merrymount apartments. - Listen, Joe, I just... - McGovern said to get up there pronto. Listen, darling, order me a... Oh, never mind. At least we had some chicken soup together. They'll never be able to take that away from us. Bye. - Two old-fashions. - Yes, Miss. Hey, what's the idea, Mac, this is supposed to be my night off. You're a cop, Kenny, not a night owl. I was just having dinner with Maxine. Yeah, I know. And I suppose she was trying to get you to resign from the Force again. Yeah, and she's absolutely right too. What's she going to tell the children? What's she going to say... ...when they ask where's Poppa? Darn if I know. Well, good night. Hey, wait a minute, aren't you coming? No, I just wanted to see that you got down here all right. They're giving me a big banquet downtown. - Hello, boys. - Well, well, if it isn't the genius himself. Don't look now, Bixter, but I think we've got company. Oh, you're here! Goody-goody! What seems to be the trouble? Don't he ask the cleverest questions? A lady committed suicide. Maybe she found out you were coming! - Who asked you to come up here anyhow? - Captain McGovern. You must know him, we all work for him. He seemed to think that you boys might need a little expert help. Do you mind if I take a look at the corpse? Oh, no, not at all. Ain't he morbid? And what gave you boys the idea it was suicide? The doors were all locked from the inside. We had to break in. The fingerprints on the knife are the same as those on the corpus delicti. In fact, she was holding the handle just like this... ...when rigor mortis set in. Your Latin stinks. We're on the 16th floor, Lieutenant. And even you can see there are no ledges, no fire escapes - Oh, you noticed that too. - Yes. - Where's Anderson? - I sent him out to locate the children. What children? These children. Let me speak to Miss Maxine Carroll, please... Yeah. Those aren't children, you dope, those are midgets. - Midgets? - Certainly, the one on the right's... ...old enough to be your father. Now what would she be doing with midgets? I don't know, I've never been a midget. Hello, darling. I'm sorry I had to leave you in such a hurry. I'll be over there again in about five minutes. Will you order me a steak? A nice, big, juicy sirloin. Yes, and some chiffonade salad. Uh-huh. Mashed potatoes, maccaroni au gratin... Why, sure I'll be alright, I just said I would. Yeah... Sure, I just said I would. Listen, honey, cancel that order. I just got an idea. I'll grab a sandwich and see you first thing in the morning. - Good night, boys. - Wait a minute. You're not going without giving us some of your expert advice. Boys, I'll tell you. I'll give you a clue. - The lady was a snake charmer. - I get it! And one of her snakes stabbed her. Yeah... that's right. Then the snake put on his hat, locked the door... - ...went over the transom... - Ah-ah, no transom! Anyway, he rang the elevator bell, the boy took him down, he got in a cab and went home to the zoo. Good night. - Did you ever hear such stupid nonsense? - The guy's crazy! - You're standing on my foot. - And that's the guy they think is a genius. You're standing on my foot. Well you're ski... No... no... The door was bolted from the inside... ...so we were forced to break in. The apartment, which is on the 16th floor, seemed in perfect order. There were absolutely no signs of a struggle. Every indication points to suicide. Good afternoon, students. I see you're all busy improving your minds. The woman was lying sprawled out on a rug near the fireplace. The woman was lying sprawled out on a rug... What are you doing, Bixler, writing her memoirs? I had a feeling things were too peaceful around here. - What comes after suicide? - Comma. Period! I wouldn't put that through if I were you, Bixler. - It was a plain case of murder. - Murder! - Yeah. You remember those snakes? - Do I! Well, women don't usually keep snakes for pets, isn't that right? That's right. And they don't usually run around with midgets, isn't that right? That's right. So I immediately thought of a circus, isn't that right? - That's right. - Circuses employ strange people... ...with unusual talents isn't that right? You said it! So I saw the possibility of a murder, isn't that right? That's right. Say, who is this guy, Charlie McCarthy? No, no. No, he belonged to the circus too, isn't that right? That's right. Then I suppose you think it's murder... Isn't that right? That's right. - I know it's murder. - Oh, you do. Yes. And what police college did you graduate from, may I ask? None. - Yet you think you can solve this case. - Yes. - Why? - I am the man that kill her. Yeah, he's the man that killed her. He's a knife thrower. You see, he and the Vincent woman... ...worked together in the same act for years, isn't that right? - That's right, se?or. - Then she ran away with another man. So Rinaldo took the apartment across the court... and bided his time. That's why there were no fingerprints on the knife. You see gentlemen, I throw the knife like this! - Hold it! - Ah-ah! Never mind that. There you are, Bixler, a signed confession. Take him away, I've got more important things to do. - Hello. - Hello, Maxine? Hello, darling. What's the idea of letting me sit alone in a restaurant? I had to pay my own check. What kind of a guy are you anyway? Oh, listen, honey, don't get mad. You'll get wrinkles. Well, I couldn't help it about last night. Yeah, but listen, tonight's gonna be different. We'll go out and paint the town red, white and blue. Uh-huh... Alright, baby, I'll be over at the apartment in about an hour. It was pretty sweet of him to send me flowers. Guess I'll have to forgive him after all. Softy. The latest victim of the phantom slugger just died in the emergency hospital. The mayor's on the warpath, and I can't say that I blame him. So far you fellows have gotten nowhere. Say, chief, I got a theory. - Yeah, what is it? - Well, you see, this guy... This guy never molests them. No, he just hits them over the head with a club. Pipe down, Williams! As I was gonna say, this guy never molests them or robs them. - So you know what I figure? - What? - He just don't like women. - Ohhh! Hm-hmm! That's positively brilliant, Deever. I'm sorry I can't stay to hear the rest of it. Where do you think you're going? - I have to get a shave. - Wait a minute. You wouldn't happen to have any ideas on how to catch the phantom slugger, would you? Why, sure! Dress this monkey up in women's clothes and send him out in the street as a decoy. - What? - Oh, you can do it, Deever, you're the prettiest cop in the Force. Look at that waist line, chief, nice and slender. Those beautiful big, brown eyes. Just pour a pint of perfume over him and you'll be perfect. Cut out those rattle-brain ideas of yours! This is the Police Department, not the Follies! - Well, you asked for it, there it is. - Wait a minute. - You seem to be anxious to go somewhere. - Yes, sir, I'm through for the day. Oh, yeah? Come in to my office. I want to talk to you. Go down to the jail and pick up Texas Buck Moseby. You're taking him up to the big house tonight. Mac, be reasonable. I catch him, let somebody else take him up. Your train leaves at 6:20, Union Station. Six-twenty, that's impossible. Well, I mean... I've got a date with Maxine tonight. Oh, that's a shame, Kenny. I didn't realize you'd made other plans. She's a lovely girl. You're telling me? We're gonna get married. - Tonight? - No, not tonight, but I'm taking her out to dinner at 6:30. Tell you what I'll do. At 6:30 I'll call her up myself... and I'll tell her you're having dinner... ...with Texas Buck Moseby on the train. Mac, be reasonable, will... Think I'll wear my pink dress tonight. The one with the full skirt. Don't put it on till you see the whites of his eyes. What? Everytime Kenny sends you roses you end up all dressed up. Made up, and stood up. - Hello. - Hello, Maxine? - Yes, dear. - Well, er... Since I last talked to you, er... something... Kenny Williams, you're not trying to break our dinner engagement tonight, are you? It's... just, er... Well, it's like this, I... Because if you do, it's all over between us, you understand that, don't you? Oh, sure. Well... I really just called to see if you got those flowers I sent you. Yes, dear, they're perfectly lovely. I'll be expecting you tonight at 6:30 rain or shine, goodbye. Goodbye. Here's your prisoner, Williams. - Hello, Buck. - How are you, Lieutenant? Keep your eye on this bird, he has more ways of getting out on our trains than a mail sack. Oh, yeah? Well, tell the taxpayers to relax. Buck owes the State 40 years and we're going to collect every day of it. Let's go, Buck. - Where to? - 421, West Avenue. Since when they moved the station up there? We're not going to the station. I've got to stop off and see my girl. What about me? My stretch is supposed to start at half past six tonight. Yeah, well it'll only take a few minutes. Say, do you realize how long a few minutes is gonna be at the end of forty years? I think you've got something there. Say, Lieutenant, this is gonna be sort of embarrassing to me... ...meeting a girl under these conditions. You're not even gonna see her. You're gonna stay right here. You mean you're gonna leave me out here all alone? Sure, you can climb up and down that thing if you wanna, but don't go too far away. - Say, you can't do this to me. - Wire your congressman. - Oh, darling, I knew you'd come. - Yeah. - Kenny, you're a half hour early. - Yeah, that's because I... I know, I know... Effie! Effie, get me my new hat. - Listen, Maxine... - Effie said you wouldn't turn up... - ...but I knew better, didn't I? - Yeah, but... Oh, we're going to have a wonderful time tonight, just like old times, isn't it? - Yeah. - Get me my bag too, Effie. Wait till you see my new hat, you'll just adore it. Yeah, I bet I will. It's going to be so much fun being with you tonight, Kenny. - Yeah, but listen, honey. - Here you are. - Thank you, Effie. - Oh, hello. - Hello. - Look. - You like it? - Yeah, it's swell. - Oh, you don't like it. - Yes, I do, really I do. - I bought it specially for the occasion. - Yeah... Don't wait for us, Effie, we're going to be very late. Wait a minute, honey, I've got to tell you something. - Tell me in the cab. - No, I have to tell you now. - Oh, wait till we're alone. - No, I can't because... Well, you see, I er... I've got somebody outside. - Who? - Er... a friend of mine. A guy I went to college with. Oh, what did you bring him for? I couldn't help it. You see, he doesn't get to town very often and... Oh, don't be so selfish, Maxine, let's have the poor man in. No, no... wait a minute, I'd better tell him. You see, he's sort of shy with women. Hmm... he sounds just my type. You done already? Listen, Buck. - I want you to do me a little favor. - For what? I'm going to introduce you to a couple of ladies and... ...I want you to try to act like a gentleman. - What about the train? - We can catch the 11:45. Now wait a minute, I know my rights. I don't have to take any blind date. Listen to me, either you do this for me or I'll have the warden... ...take away your Sunday baseball. Come on, take me to the station. Listen, Buck, you're making a big mistake. She's one of the most beautiful blondes you ever laid your eyes on. Blonde, huh? Yeah, stands about five foot six, about 125-30 pounds, big blue eyes. - Nice. - You know, the soft, liquid kind. - That's my weekness. - That's what I thought. Well, what good am I in handcuffs? We can take those off, if you promise to behave yourself. - I'll try. - Okay. Now listen, Buck... Just as a reminder, I want to show you something. National pistol champion, Kenny Williams, 1939. Very pretty. Come on, where's the blonde? Listen, Buck, don't forget your name's not Buck Moseby tonight, it's Charlie Jones. Sure. Maxine, honey, this is Charlie Jones. Pleased to meet you. Say, Kenny was wrong about you. - You don't weigh no 130 lb. - Hey, Charlie... But he was sure right about those big blue eyes. Charlie, this is Effie. - Oh, I get it. This is mine. - Uh-huh. - Migby. - Migby? Isn't that wonderful? Charlie's quite a card. Where do we intend to go for dinner? I thought we'd just go around to Tony's. Oh, not on a night like this. Why don't we go out in the open where they got trees and bushes? Now Mr. Jones, no bushes. This is my evening and I want to go to the beach. Well, listen, honey, don't you think that... Boy, that's what I like, the wide open spaces. - Why not, what's holding us up? - Age before beauty. Listen, Buck, don't forget that medal. I got a medal too once, for the 100-yard dash. - Happy? - Hm-hmm. Why do you look at me like that? I was just thinking, sugar. Do you believe in long engagements? Oh! Say, that friend of yours doesn't waste much time, does he? No. As a matter of fact he hasn't got much time to waste. What does he do? Well, right now, honey, he's sort of connected with the law. Oh, that's the position you should be in. Remember, I'm not going to marry you as long as you're a policeman. Hey, Charlie. - Just what do you think you're doing? - I'm gonna do some shooting. Yeah? What do you think I ought to shoot at, Kenny? I'd aim at those squirrels. Okay, but I can't always guarantee what I'll hit. Well, here, I'll show you. Alright, it's your turn. Here, let me try it. Here you are, mister. There you are, Charlie That may quiet your nerves. - Wasn't it exciting? - Yes... Looks like we're going to have a big evening. - I'm right with you, Jonesy. - You seem kind of nervous tonight, Kenny. - Who, me? - Uh-huh. What was the idea of all that cowboy stuff at the shooting gallery? Oh, I just like to keep my hand in. Were you trying to impress me or Mr. Jones? No, I just wanted to get Charlie a good cigar. Am I going to see you tomorrow, Charlie? I'm afraid I'm gonna be tied up tomorrow, Effie. - And the next day? - Yep, and the day after that. I'm afraid you really don't like me, Charlie. Oh, I swear I'll never look at another woman as long as I live. Oh, Charlie! - Hi, Buck. - Hiya, Joe. - I thought you were in the can. - You did? Could sue him for that. - Did he say Buck? - Oh, just a nickname. Hey, friend of yours? Yeah, a very good friend. There isn't anything he wouldn't do for me. I wouldn't ask a friend to do too much, if I were you, Jonesy. How long have you known Mr. Jones? - Jonesy? - Uh-huh. Oh, I must have known him for about ten years. Really? Mind if I cut in? Mr. Jones, how long have you known Kenny? Oh, ever since we went to college. Wake up, Kenny, you're walking in my sleep. It must be fun running into an old alumnus like this. Oh, go on, you ain't so old. Mr. Jones, just what is your alma mater? Listen, lady, let's cut out the double-talking... ...and get down to brass tax, huh? You're okay, baby! Well, don't you think we've danced enough? Come on, let's get a drink. It's okay with me, Miss Carroll. Will you share a glass of beer and a pretzel? You three go ahead, I'm going to powder my nose. - Your nose looks alright to me. - Whose nose is it, anyway? Kenny, that gal of yours swings a mean line of Pig Latin. What'll you have, baby? All I can say is it's the only time I've ever felt like a wallflower... ...without a wall to lean on. Banana split! - What are you having? - I'm gonna have my head examined. He'll have his head examined. Hello, Captain McGovern? Do you know where Kenny Williams is? - He had a date with me tonight. - Oh, Miss Carroll, I'm awfully sorry. I promised Mr. Williams I'd call you up... ...and tell you that he was having dinner with Texas Buck Moseby on the train. It must be wonderful to be a great big policeman and know everything like you do. - Hey, what is this? - Oh, nothing, I just got through dancing with Texas Buck Moseby and I'm going back and have another. You're crazy, where are you? At the Beach Casino with Kenny Williams having a wonderful time. It's that Carroll dame trying to pull my leg. She says Texas Buck Moseby and Williams are out at the casino dancing. That's a hot one. She's just sore because he put one over on her. Hey, Captain, the warden just called up from the prison... ...and says Moseby and Williams haven't arrived yet. - What? - Honest! Hello, Miss Carroll, can you hang on to him till I get out there? Hang on to him? Captain, I can't get rid of him. Call out the riot squad. I'm going to the Beach Casino, I've got a date with Kenny Williams. How many dances does that make? Five. Say, don't you two want to go home yet? I wish I knew what he's got that I haven't got. Maxine. Say, you know, you're the swellest little wagon that ever came down my alley. What do you say we ditch the others and make a night of it? Oh, Charlie, I can't. I came with Lt. Williams. So did I. - Bixler, you and Deever go round the back. - Okay, Chief. I'll tell you what let's do. I'll sneak out and make a phone call, you meet me outside later. - Charlie, you can't leave me here! - Sorry, lady, I can't wait. Alright, come on, Cinderella. The ball is over. - Hiya, Mac. - Turn that man over to Lt. Bixler! - You're under arrest. - Aw, this is getting monotonous! Well, Williams? - Well, listen, Mac... - That's enough... hold it. Fine dancing partners for these young ladies. Buck Moseby, notorious convict and killer. Take that girl outside in the fresh air. Hey, you. Come up here and get this music started. Go ahead with your dancing, folks. The trouble's all over. Put me down, please. - Are you all right, Effie? - Oh! Maxine, I don't know what to say, I... Kenny Williams, of all the shabby tricks you've ever played on me this is the worst. Letting me dance with a common murderer. I'm so humiliated. And as for Effie, you've lost her friendship for good. What friendship? - Well, listen, Maxine... - There's nothing more to say. Williams! Don't run away, honey. Well, Lieutenant, I hope you're proud of yourself. This is the first time since I've had charge of the Department... ...that I'll have to go to my superior and apologize for one of my men. - Honestly, Mac, I... - Save your breath. You're to report with me to the Police Commissioner... ...the first thing tomorrow morning. Drive on, driver. Hey, Maxine! Thanks for a swell party, Kenny. I'll be seeing you in about forty years. - Mister Mayor, this is shameful. - This is an outrage! Mayor Johnson, it isn't safe for a woman to be out in the streets! Our wives and daughters are at risk! We're taking chances as long as this guy's free. Captain McGovern will be here at any moment. He'll explain everything. Poor McGovern. I'd rather face a bargain sale in a barrel than go into that mob. - Wonder what they're gonna do to Kenny. - They ought to give him the chair. - And put a tack on it. - I hope they fire him for good. - Oh, Captain McGovern! - Yes? Aren't you going to thank me for last night? Well, if I thought it showed any civic interest, Miss Carroll, I might congratulate you. But I know why you called me up last night. You hoped that Williams would be fired. - Is he going to be? - No. I suspended him for sixty days without pay. You see, I'm more interested in making Kenny a good cop... ...than a good husband. He is, is he? Captain McGovern, this citizens' committee have expressed themselves... ...as having become dissatisfied with your department. Particularly in regard to the phantom slugger case... ...and this disgraceful exhibition last night. The time has come for a showdown. Have you or have you not some feasible plan to offer... ...for the apprehension of this public menace to the womanhood of our town? Miss Carroll, be good enough to take notes. Proceed. I've been thinking of sending one of our men out on the streets at night... ...er...as a decoy. Dressed as a... a woman. That's the first sensible plan I've heard. Why hasn't this suggestion been offered before? The difficulty is in finding a good man willing to undertake the job. Most of my fellows would resign... ...before they'd parade the streets in woman's clothes. - I can't see why! - For some reason, madam, men still prefer to dress as men. You could hardly expect the average man to er... ...take the ridicule and the humiliation he'd be put through. What you say is probably true, Captain. But this is a crisis that calls for heroic measures. If they won't volunteer, you've got to order someone to do it. Well? I don't think Lt. Williams would like the idea much. Like the idea? Well, who cares whether he likes it or not? Besides, he's been suspended for sixty days. Reinstate him at once, on condition that he accept this assignment. If he refuses, we'll dispense with his services for good. I'm sick of this favoritism, McGovern. - Miss Carroll, send for Lt. Williams. - With pleasure. Well, I think we're on the right track now. At least... - Hello. - Hello. - Still mad at me? - Mad? - What have I got to be mad about? - I don't know. I think you're wonderful. - Are you kidding? - No, of course I'm not kidding. I just realized what a dope I've been. Kenny, I've never really appreciated you before. But now I know what a fine policeman you are. And I... well... - Say, what's the matter with you anyway? - Nothing. Nothing at all. I guess I'm just a little emotional today. You see, they're all waiting for you in there... ...to present you with a very high honor. - Honor? - Yes, a nice, big, juicy assignment... ...that may lead anywhere. - Oh, boy. - Yes, Kenny, ...you're really going to be the flower of the Force. Hm, excuse me. I'm not gonna do it, Mac! They can hang me, shoot me or send me to the chair! I'd die before I appear like this in public. - But it was your idea. - Yeah, for Deever. The first requirement of any good officer... ...is never to ask a man to do something he wouldn't do himself. Okay. You try it. - I'm a captain, you're only a lieutenant. - Well, from now on I'm not even that. - What are you doing? - I'm resigning, right here and now. But don't you see? That's exactly what she wants you to do. - She who? - Maxine, this was her idea. Oh, it was, was it? Yeah, she's the one that suggested you to the mayor. And when we nabbed you and Buck Moseby down at the beach... ...who do think it was tipped us off? - Maxine? - Sure! Listen, Kenny, she don't want you to be a cop. She's saving you to push baby carriages around the park. - She expects you to resign. - Oh, she does, does she? Well, I'll show her. Pushing baby carriages isn't exactly in my line. Oh, I don't know. You look like you'd make a very good mother. May I make a one suggestion? Ladies usually wear their garters inside their slips. Outside of that you look scrumptious. Excuse me... - So you thought I'd resign, did you? - Some men would. Well, it just happens that my pride goes a little bit farther than that. I don't particularly like making a jackass out of myself. But it's for a good cause! I'd walk down Main Street in a Turkish towel... ...before I'd let any woman control my life. Alright, go ahead. Make a fool out of yourself. See if I care. But I'll tell you one thing, Kenny Williams, if you go out in that getup, I'm through! That suits me! And don't you dare send me roses, I'll send them right back! That suits me too! I'll probably have to use them. Good grief, you look like my aunt Nellie. Let me out of here. Well, did he resign? Captain McGovern, when you die, why don't you leave your body to science? What for? I'd just like to know what cops use for a heart. Well, are you ready? Yeah. - Hey, do you smell something? - Yeah, it's me! Down, please. After you, madam. Paging Mrs. Carraway. Mrs. Carraway, paging Mrs. Carraway. Mrs. Carraway? Paging Mrs. Carraway. Here she comes. - Paging, Mrs. Carraway. - Don't worry, Kenny. You look perfect. From now on you're on your own and good luck. Good night, dear. There you are... - Aw, lady, are you hurt? - Hey, cutie, how about a date? Upsy-daisy. Hm, lady, are you strong! Hey, lady, did you know that guy you smacked is a detective? So what? Oh, nothing, nothing, I just thought I'd mention it. Yes, yes... Yes. I don't want excuses, I want you to locate Williams. Well he's been gone 48 hours. Maybe he's run out on us. Couldn't stand the gamb. No, Kenny wouldn't do that. Once he takes an assignment, he sticks. Say, Chief, that Carroll girl's outside. - What does she want? - She says she's worried about Kenny. Wants to know where he is. Captain McGovern, tell me what's happened to Kenny. Oh, you're worried about him now, are you? - I wasn't able to sleep a wink. - Well, that's just too bad. I suppose you think Kenny does these things just for you to lose your sleep. No... No, I think he does it because he likes the excitement. Partly, but there's just a little more to it than that. It's a thing called duty, Miss Carroll, ...but you don't seem to understand much about it. Captain, you must tell me, where is he now? I don't know and I woudn't tell you if I did. You see, I don't think you're good enough for him. The woman that marries that man has got to take him for what he is, a good cop, not what she wants him to be. A call just came through. They've located Williams at the corner of 6th and Main. Alright, alright. Kenny! Lt. Williams is here. Do I let him in? No, tell him to wait just a minute, please. Effie, get my bed jacket, quick. Now get me the temperature chart. Hurry... and a pencil. Zip! - What's that? - My temperature. Effie, I'm sick, very sick. In fact, I'm gonna die. Can you cry? Oh, I get it. Crank down the bed. - I wish this thing could play music. - Okay. Now you can call him in. Effie! Cry! You can come in now, Kenny. But be very quiet. Maxine. - Maxine, honey. - Yes? Who is it? Are you alright, baby? Yes, dear... I'm alright. Maxine, honey. You shouldn't have followed me. I'll never forgive myself for what happened. Don't blame yourself, Kenny. I realize now that your life is my life. Wherever you go, I go. But Maxine, you can't do that. It's an impossible life for a woman to lead. It's the life you've chosen, Kenny. Well, I don't have to keep at it. - I can do something else. - I can't let you make that sacrifice. What are you doing? I'm sending in my resignation. Hm? Boys, the night watchman has been killed at the First National Bank on Spring St. Twenty-five grand taken out of the vault. Get going! - The last one out's an old maid. - Where's Williams? - Nobody's seen him since his girl got hurt. - He's never around when he's wanted. I'm gonna fire that guy if it's the last thing I do. - Note from Williams, Mac. - Williams? - Well I'll be... - What is it? So he thinks he's going to walk out on me, does he? With a bank murder on my hands? Not today, he won't! - You men go with Deever! - Come on, boys. Bixler, you and I are going to see that Williams doesn't resign. Have these signed and bring them back right away. - Hello. - Hello, Miss Carroll. Effie, here it is, our marriage license. Well! - That's something. - And look, isn't it beautiful? Gee, it almost looks real. Boy, a $25.000 bank robbery! That's a lot of dollars. Oh, but you aren't interested in that sort of thing anymore, are you, Kenny? Huh? Oh... no, no, I'm not interested in that kind of thing anymore. Say, Effie, will you call the Mayor? We thought we'd like to have him marry us. Oh, he's going to be tied up until about 12 o'clock. Twelve o'clock? Well, we've got a couple of hours to kill. Effie, as long as you're taking over my job, I'll show you where things are. - Alright. - And honey, you make yourself at home. Uh-huh. Over here is all the correspondence from the Board of Education. And down here is the Mayor's personal mail. On this side, the reports from the City Planning Board. And I keep all the unanswered correspondence in here. Listen, honey, I think I'll go over and turn in my shield and... ...the key to my locker. - Hello, Bixler. - Oh, hello, Williams. What's the idea of the fishing rod? To catch fish. Say, what are you doing up here anyway? I thought you resigned. I just came up to turn in my badge. You and me both. What do you mean? - I'm resigning too. - You're resigning? What for? Well, he can insult me up here if he wants to, but not before any bank president. So I'm quitting. What are you talking about? You see, Kenny, this bank murder is a marvelous case. There isn't a clue within a mile. It's one of those cases that happen once a year. And there I am, getting all hot with ideas... So he calls me a fathead in front of the president. I'm through. - So it's a tough case, huh? - Oh, it's a lulu. - The phone's ringing. - Yeah, I hear it. - Aren't you going to answer it? - No. - Now listen, you'd better answer it. - Why? I've resigned. We're not working here anymore, are we, kid? Yeah, that's right. Listen, maybe somebody's in trouble. Yeah, maybe somebody is in trouble. Don't you think we ought to answer it? - Okay, let's answer it. - I'll get it. Hello, Homicide Bureau. Yeah, who's talking? McGovern? Oh, hang up on him, Kenny! Show the old monkey what you think of him. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What did you say, Mac? Um... well, I'll look around and see if he's here. - He wants you. - Well, tell him I don't want to talk to him. - Wait a minute, I'll tell him myself. - Will you get out. Hello, Mac... Huh? Well... I don't know. I'll see what I can do, he's pretty sore. Huh? Okay. Oh, boy, can you beat that? McGovern's sorry he blew up. He wants me to bring you over to the bank so he can apologize. Not me, I'll pop him right in the nose! - Can I depend on that? - You know my temper! Listen, I can't miss this. I got a couple of hours to kill. I'll take you over there. - No. - Aw, listen, Bixler, come on, ...don't be stubborn. It isn't every day in the week you get a chance to make McGovern crawl. Well, alright... but no work! - No, we don't work here anymore. - Boy, this will be fun. I hope. Is this the Street Clean Department? Hello, Jean? This is Effie. Oh, Effie Perkins in the Mayor's office. Listen, honey, Maxine's getting married to Kenny Williams at 12 o'clock... ...and she wants you to come to the wedding. - Effie! - Tell Muriel in Waterworks. - Oh! And I'll try to get hold of Gladys at Garbage Disposal. Oh, put that phone down! And Jean, tell everybody to bring some nice little presents. It's a surprise. Alright, honey, goodbye. - Effie, what did you do that for? - Why not, I'd like to know. Goodness knows you're always buying presents for their birthdays... ...and things. What are you doing, Mac? Praying for guidance? No cracks, you've resigned. Listen, you wanted to apologize to this monkey, here he is. Yeah, here I am! I'll apologize to you in a couple of minutes, I'm busy right now. - Stick around and learn something. - You see?! Wait a minute, Bixler. Stick around and watch the old man trying to use his own brains for a change. - Save those drillings. - Fine. - Get out your notebook. - Okay. - Say, he's impressive, ain't he? - Yeah. Especially when you don't have to work for him. Miller the night watchman was found with two bullets in him lying on the floor. His gun has showed one empty shell. The bandits, two or more of them, evidently tied him up, left him here and went to work on the vault. The watchman worked one hand loose, drew his gun and fired a shot at them. Shhh, don't laugh out loud. What are you two clowns laughing at? Imagine leaving a gun with the watchman even if he was tied up. Oh, getting smart, aren't you, now that you're off of the job. Oh, no, he's right, Mac. They must have taken his gun away. But... There was another gun in the drawer. The watchman knew that. He worked his hand loose alright, and pulled open the drawer. Ahhh! Now, let's see. The bandits were working at the vault. The watchman took a shot at him through this glass partition. Then he tried to duck through that door. But they got him. Come on. Come here. If the watchman had fired from here through the partition, the broken glass would have been on the other side. Take a look. So the bandit must have fired from there through the partition. There it is. Five'll get you fifty if that bullet didn't come from the watchman's gun. It's a cinch! If they'd only left a tool, a glove, or something. Yeah, or their address, or a telephone number. Besides, there was only one, Mac. A big fella, strong and quick. How do you know? If there'd been more than one, they wouldn't have left the watchman unguarded. No, no. He broke into the bank, overpowered the watchman, tied him up in the office here, took his gun away from him, and then he went to work on the vault. In the meantime, the watchman got another gun out of this drawer... ...and fired at him through the open door. He missed and that was just too bad. Because then the bandit fired at him through the partition. Aw, now you've gone and spoiled it. Why are you cracking the case for him? Because I don't like bank robbers that kill night watchmen. - How did he get in? - From the alley. Let's take a look. What did you find out here, Mac? There's a tyre print that wasn't made by my car. - I see you've made a cast of it. - Yeah. - Anything else? - Where's that book? Oh, that's nothing. Just a paintbook some kid threw away. Kids don't usually throw away unfinished paintbooks. Look, Peter Rabbit with a beard. And Cinderella with a beard. And Snow White with a beard. - Where did you find this book, Mac? - Out here in the tracks. He may have been smart enough to remember this old gag. How's that? Say, that must have fallen off when he made his getaway. Hop in, Bixler. Say, where do you mugs think you're going? I'm going down to the Board of Education. Try to get you in kindergarten. No you don't, not in my car! Sue me! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello, sonny. - Hello. Gee wiz, why do you put little whiskers on all the little girls? I put whiskers on everybody. - You do, why? - Because I do whiskers so good. Quiet! Look. Did you ever see this before? Why, sure. That's my paintbook. Where'd you find it? - Where'd you lose it? - Home last night. You did? Tell me about it. I was painting in it when Pop came in... ...and said Mrs. Murphy and I could go to the movies. - Oh, did you go? - Why, sure! Quiet, children, please! Well, listen, when you got home, did you ask your daddy about it? No, he'd went out. Gone out! Yeah, gone and went out. Children! - Where do you live, sonny? - 122, Maple Street. 122, Maple. We're police officers, Stanley, we want to ask you a couple of questions. Okay. - Is that your car? - Yes. You're a loser, aren't you, Stanley? According to records, you did a year for burglary in 1930. Where were you last night? Nowhere... just went out for a little ride. Hey, Kenny, take a look. Well, there's the torch. And a pair of gloves. Half burned. And an empty whisky bottle. - You've been doing a little drinking, huh? - No. Not a drop. I haven't broken my parole in any way. Alright, Bixler, mark those exhibits for evidence. Okay. - Where's the money? - I haven't got it. Quit stalling. You broke in to the First National and murdered the watchman. I didn't, I swear I didn't. And the tyre prints check too. Okay, let's have the story. Well, well, what's all this? Oh, I hope you don't mind. Effie and I thought it would be kind of nice to have some friends in. Oh, of course I don't mind. But isn't it a little late? Hello, Maxine. I'm sorry I'm late. Where's the lucky man? - Yes, where is the lucky man? - Oh, he'll be here in a minute. Thank you... There he is now! Always prowling. Is this the Mayor's office? Yes. Right after the boy went to the movies, a man rang my doorbell. He told me one of the clerks was trapped in the vault at the bank... ...and would I bring my torch quick. It was a matter of life and death. - Yeah, go on. - We hurried down here for the car. He must have picked up Johnny's paintbook... ...and put it across the license plate while I was getting the torch. We got to the bank, the watchman was all tied up and lying on the floor. The man shoved a gun in my back and told me to get to work at the vault. Well... I was working at the vault like this. The watchman was tied up in the office. He must have gotten an arm loose and grabbed a pistol out of the drawer. He fired at us. And the man behind me... ...fired back across my shoulder, using me as a shield. He... he fired three times. That was the end of the watchman. What did this mysterious midnight visitor of yours look like? It was so dark and I was so excited that... I can't very well describe him. Don't you believe I'm telling the truth? That's for the judge and the jury to decide. We only work here. Come on. - Any sign of him, Effie? - No, not yet. Well, I'm awfully sorry, but I'm afraid I have to go. - So do I. - Oh, it's too bad. - Bye. - Oh, I feel so sorry for Maxine. - May I take back my present? - Sure, it'll never be missed. Oh, come on, girls. Let's all have another piece of cake or something. I'm sure he'll be here in a minute. Come on, come on. Must be embarrassing for poor Maxine... ...to have to wait so long for the man she's going to marry. Say listen, dearie. That's nothing to the wait you're going to have. - Is he here? - No. - Did you call the Department? - Yes. He left his shield but they don't know where he went. If he doesn't come pretty soon, Maxine, I'm afraid I... I know... I know, you've been awfully patient. Well, I guess there's nothing else to do but go out and apologize. I don't know what's happened to Kenny. Guess he got held up somewhere. I realize you all have to get back to your work. Thanks for coming. - Bye, Maxine. - Bye. - I'm awfully sorry. - Bye. Well, here's the best man. Better late than never. Says who? Mr. Mayor, you'd have been proud of my department if you could have seen... the way Kenny Williams dived into that case... ... and started to put the darn thing together. I tell you, the fellow's a genius. He no sooner... - What case? - The First National Bank robbery. He's got that case sewed up tighter than a drum. - So he went back. - Sure. Soon as he got his nose on the trail you couldn't see him for dust. Alright, Mac, you win. I lose. Oh, cheer up. He'll be here soon. That's just not soon enough. - Oh, don't take it that way, Maxine... - Come inside, McGovern. Effie. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to put these back where they were. - What do you mean? - You're still my assistant. And I'm still the Mayor's secretary. Gee... it's alright with me. Your Honor, would you like copies of the Finance Commissioner's report? Yes... but I thought you were leaving. So did I. Guess it's a joke on both of us. Guess who. Sorry, Kenny, I'm afraid we can't laugh this one off. Oh, listen, Maxine, if it hadn't been for one of the most interesting cases... Sure, they're all interesting. And this one was a pip. Only I had the darned fool notion that two people getting married... ought to feel it's... something that happens once in their lives. And police cases come a dime a dozen. But of course if it's as interesting as you say it was. Where are you going? I still work here, Kenny, and you still work over there. - Now listen, honey, I'm really sorry. - Sure you are. You're always sorry. it's not your fault. You try, I guess. You just become a little tin soldier that McGovern winds up and off you go. Well, keep going, I don't want it that way. You don't really need me. You're married to the department and I wouldn't break that up for worlds. Here's the marriage license. Make it legal. Cross my name off and put his in. I hope you both will be very, very happy. Come on, Kenny, let's go. Congratulations. I hope all your kids have flat feet. I guess you feel pretty proud of yourself, don't you. Not particularly. You'll probably be a big shot someday. But no matter how far you stick your chest out... ...there's one little fellow that will always have your number. My kid. You're not fooling him. Leave the kid out of it. You should have thought of him in the first place. - If there's anything I can do for him, I... - He wouldn't take favors from you. For as long as he lives... he'll always know you as a swell-headed cop that would rather... ...send an innocent man to the chair than admit he was wrong. You've taken sweetness out of his heart and filled it with hate. Where does a kid go from there? Tell me! Where does a kid go from there? I'm sorry. I blew up. It's alright. - It was the kid, more than anything else. - Yeah, I know. Hey, get me one of my cigarettes, will you? Sure. Say, were you wearing this coat at the night of the robbery? - Yes. - Holy mackerel! Why, what's the matter? You see that faint line across there where the nap is burnt? - Yes. - That's a powder burn. That line was made by a bullet. As if someone had shot across your shoulder from behind. - That's what I told you. - Yeah, I know. But my job is to believe what I see, not what I hear. Say, can't you remember what the guy looked like? Don't you remember anything about him? It's just as I said, I... I was so excited, I can't remember, I... I can't remember. Say, Stanley, were you on the level when you said you didn't drink? Yes. Then that whisky bottle we found in the back of the car didn't belong to you? No, it didn't. That's the only lead we've got. Come on. Why? Where are we going? We're getting off at the next stop. Brother, it was a lucky day for you when you ran into me. Oh, I'm lucky now, am I? Hello, Kenny, where are you? Er... Well, never mind that, but... Listen, I got off the train. I've decided not to deliver Stanley. What?! Well, listen, Mac, I'm convinced we've have the wrong guy. - Stanley never pulled that job. - Why, you... Say, listen, you pig-headed jackass! Nothing but a wild hunch to go on and that guy sentenced to burn? The court says he's guilty. You can't refuse to deliver him on your own authority! I know, I know, Mac, it's not legal. But in this case it's justice. Listen, Williams, you deliver that guy up here in five minutes... ...or I'll break you for life! Where are you? Okay, Mac, if you want it that way, come and find me. You're a good detective! What's up, Chief? Boys, it's Williams again. He skipped the train with Stanley. He's crazy! You think he's trying to pull another Buck Moseby? I don't know what he's trying to do! Anderson, you go to Kenny's home. Jameson, you and Riley go to Stanley's place. - Bixler, you and Deever come with me. - Right. Yeah, but don't anybody go to the Beach Casino? Come on! - Effie. Effie! - Huh? Somebody's at the door. Wonder who it is. Oh... I suppose my sister had another baby. I want you fellows to search this place thoroughly. Just because there are a couple of women, don't get soft. Well, I... Cut it out, young lady! You two fellows look around in here while I search the bedroom. - What are you doing here? - Looking for Kenny Williams. Williams... Williams? Never heard of him. Quit stalling! Where is he? I haven't seen Mr. Williams since he left me waiting at the typewriter. I gave him to you, remember? Sister, you can have him back, at bargain prices. Don't tell me you two kiddies had a fight or something. No. He only defied me and the whole Police Department, that's all. - Well, what are you laughing at? - That's rich! Even you can't hold him. Well, it's not so funny this time. He goes to jail for ten years when we get hold of him. That's fine. Let me know the number of his cell, will you? I'd like to send him some old adventure magazines. Yes, and he'll need them. No sign of him, Chief. Bixler, you stand guard outside and nab him if he turns up. Deever, tap the telephone wire in the basement... ...in case he calls in from the outside. Yes, sir. I'm going back to the office. If he shows up, let me know. Okay, Chief. Gee, ten years in the clink for Kenny. You can't laugh that off. Well, whatever it is, Mr. Williams can take care of himself as I remember. But this is serious, Maxine. Oh, Effie, quit worrying. I've got a busy day tomorrow. Got to get my sleep. Can I have some change, please? Thank you. - Hello. - Hello, Maxine? This is Kenny. Listen, I'm in a terrible jam. That's not news. Your boyfriends have been draped around here all night. Well listen, honey, you've got to help me. I'm at the drugstore down in the corner. And I've got to see you. Well, I can't come up there, so you'll have to come down here. I'm sorry. I've got to get dressed and go to work. Well, stop on your way down. I'll wait here for thirty minutes. Please. Captain McGovern? Kenny just called the Carroll girl. He told her to meet him at the corner drugstore in half an hour. That's fine. Get down there and pick him up. You'd better take Bixler with you, he might put up a fight. I'll be right over. - He's not in there. - Hay, what's the idea? Did you see a guy in a light suit with a little mustache? Yeah, he was just in here using the phone. Said he was coming back in twenty minutes to meet some girl. - He's wanted by the police. - Oh? Can you fix us up in the back room so we can keep a lookout? Well, alright. But don't break anything. Hello, Maxine. Well, if it isn't the same old, incredible Mr. Williams. You still don't keep appointments, do you? I had a date with you at the drugstore. I knew your telephone was tapped. That's why I called you. - I wanted to get them away from here. - Well, well, well! Still the bright boy of the Department. Please, honey, don't joke about this, it's important. - I need your help. - Sorry, Kenny, my helping days are over. Oh, for old times' sake. What do you mean? Chicken soup? Buck Moseby? Or waiting at the church? No, listen, darling, this isn't for me. It means life or death for an innocent man. You know, the Stanley case. The guy's innocent. I've got to prove it. But there's only one clue that might lead me to the guilty man. A whisky bottle. I've got to get that bottle. Yeah? All liquor bottles have a register number. Through that I can find the retailer and cover the neighborhood. Then there's a bare possibility that I might find the guilty man. The bottle's locked away in the files. You're the only person who can get it for me. Listen, Maxine, I've got Stanley hidden away. I'm working against time. If I don't clear him, I may go out for ten years myself. I'm not concerned about that, but... I'm not going to let an innocent man take the rap. Gee... my conscience can't take it. - You are in trouble, aren't you? - Well, that's what I'm telling you. Something tells me I'm about to make a dope of myself again. - Oh, thanks, honey! - Now just a minute, Kenny. Let's understand this. I don't want you to go to jail because I have a conscience too. I'll get you this bottle. But remember one thing. I don't go with the bottle. Effie... Effie! Get Kenny some breakfast and get it fast. - For who? - Kenny. - Who? - Kenny. Well, where is he? Well, chief, he left word he'd be back here in twenty minutes to meet his girl. Alright, I'll stay here with Deever. You go up to the apartment in case anything's gone wrong. - I'm taking no chances. - Okay. Oh! - What's the matter? - Nothing. Is that you, Maxine? - Shhh! - Wait a minute! Again! Alright, Kenny, get'em up. Well, congratulations, Bixler. I'm beginning to see the first grain of dormant intelligence. How did you happen to think of coming up here... ...when I said I was gonna be down there? I don't know, I just happened to think quicker than you did, that's all. Amazing. - Where's Stanley? - Wouldn't you like to know. We'll find out. Oh, boy, are we gonna have fun down there at the department. Alright, let's go. Okay. Will you get my hat, Effie? I don't know why I'm feeling so darn bad. I guess it's just because I'm used to seeing you around. Thanks, Effie. Alright, let's go. Oh, Lieutenant Bixler. Well, you don't mean to say you really got him. Well, it looks like it. Let me be the first to congratulate you. He's been pestering the life out of Effie and me. We didn't turn him in for old times' sake but... Now he's off my conscience for good. - Hmm... - Just a little eye opener. Say, when you finish at the Department tonight why don't you come up? Thanks! I think I will. Well. Effie! - They've got Kenny. - I know, I was here. They're going to put him in jail for ten years. Do you remember I told you that last night? But you didn't seem to care. Care? If they put him in jail for one day I'd lose my mind. I love that guy! Oh, he looked so beautiful and so sad with those handcuffs on. I thought so. You've been drinking! I gotta find the guy who drank this liquor. Sure, sure... How about a little nap first? Kenny said if he could find the man who purchased this bottle... ...he'd have the guilty one. Now I'm the only one left to do it. C448641 You're crazy. What do you know about being a detective? Everything! Watch me! Good grief, she's caught it from him. It's worse than the measles. You know, I've always liked Maxine. I gotta hurry back and have that drink with her. Listen, Bixler, I'm pretty well known in this street. - Why don't you take these things off? - Yeah, let you duck away from me? Oh, nothing doing. - Now wait a minute, Williams! - I want to get some cigarettes. Well, alright. - Hello, Lieutenant. - Hello, Jones, get me some cigarettes. Pretty tough-looking customer. What are you pinching him for? You tell him, Lieutenant. Believe it or not, he's pinching me. Always having a little joke, aren't you, Lieutenant? Yes... He's terrific, isn't he? - Come on! - Hey, go easy! Hello, Lieutenant, who's the mug? Oh, just a clocker who was stepping on flowerbeds and kicking the kids around. I see you got another one, eh, Lieutenant? That's a laugh. Every one of them thinks I'm under arrest. That's right. I was just thinking the same thing. What do you mean you were just thinking the same thing? - Everyone thinks you're under arrest. - Well, come on, step on it. He looks tough, Kenny. As a matter of fact, everybody thinks you're under arrest except you. Well, what's so funny about that? Well, if there was any trouble, they'd all help me. There's not gonna be any trouble, come on! Hey, what do you think you're trying to do? You're trying to get away, huh? - Shut up! - None of that lip, big fella... - ...or I'll take a poke at you. - Who poke who? I think you wanna go bonfire, huh? You perp. It's alright, just stand back, everybody. I got him. - What happened, Kenny? - He tried to get away. - Wow. - Who is he? Keep an eye on him, will you, while I get the wagon. Okay, Kenny. And by the way, folks, don't get too close to him... ...because when he comes to he's gonna be awful mad. Jack Halsey, 643, Hope St. H. Dixson, 212, Curtis St. Regan 527, Garfield St. Now, are you sure these are all the people that bought that whisky? Yes, it's a very high-proof liquor. We don't get much call for it. Thank you very much. I tell you, Chief, the whole neighborhood's in cahoots with him. The last thing I remember twenty people were coming at me. I fought like a tiger... ...until they knocked me out. Now let me get this straight. You went up to the apartment and got him. And the Carroll girl, what did she say when you took him? She wasn't there. She got out of the elevator when I was taking Kenny out. She was glad I had him. Hey, Cap... That dame drinks in the morning. She had a bottle under her arm. She even invited me in to have a snort. Carroll drinking in the morning? A bottle? Why, you fathead! Does it occur to you that one of the main pieces of evidence... ...in the Stanley case was a whisky bottle? That girl's with him. She got the bottle for him. - Yes, sir? - Get me that bottle in the Stanley case. - If it's not there, I want the number. - Yes, sir. And I'll lay you ten to one it's not there. We'll trail that whisky bottle and catch up with Williams and the girl... ...and before I'm through I'll have them both in jail! Oh, sure! - Who are you looking for? - Mrs. Regan. - Is she at home? - No. - Are you a friend of hers? - Well... yes, er... I was supposed to meet her here. - Are you the landlady? - Yes. Would you mind if I wait upstairs for her? Not at all. But you'll have to let yourself in. I ain't gonna climb them stairs again not for nobody. - That's the key. - Thank you. Hiya, Betty! Where are you? Ah, you little rascal, you're in there, I can hear you. What are you doing? Brushing my teeth. - How's Joe? - Fine. I thought he was dying. Oh, no! Well, I'm gonna have me a little drink before we go. - What are you doing in there, kitty? - Who wants to know? Oh, so you've been drinking again, huh? Say, listen, everytime you come here you act as though you own the joint... ...and everything in it. Are we going to the races or aren't we? - Why, sure, I've been waiting for you. - You've been waiting for me? - I've been waiting for you! - Well, alright. - Well, alright! - Well, alright! This is a fine time of the day to be brushing your teeth. - Kenny! - Oh, baby. What do you mean by scaring me like this? Wait a minute, let me wipe off your chin. Aw, honey, were you really scared stiff? No. - How did you get out of there. - There was a leak in Bixler's handcuffs. It was awful cute of you leaving the bottle up in the apartment so I could follow you. You didn't need to follow me. I'm doing alright. - Well, what did you find out? - Well, I was just getting started... ...when you came crashing through that window. Detectives have stopped doing that sort of thing a long time ago. Why didn't you come through the door like I did? Well, well, you're getting pretty smart. Smart enough to know that the girl who lives here weighs 110 lbs, she's five feet four inches tall, and she's about, er... ...twenty-eight years old. You didn't happen to see her, did you? No... just instinct. Kenny, look! - Yeah, what about it? - What about it? A mink coat... ...worth $2.000 if it's worth a nickel. People living here couldn't afford a coat like this unless they... ...they stole it, or robbed a bank or something. Say, you are getting to be pretty smart. The first thing you know you'll be a detective. Yeah, detective enough to know we've got to get to the racetrack... - ...if we're gonna catch these people. - Where? - The racetrack, you know... horses... - Hey, wait a minute. - How did you happen to say racetrack? - Uh... instinct. You didn't happen to see these, did you? - What are they? - Those are $50 paramutual tickets. There's $1.000 bet on one race. And my guess is that dough like that only comes from a bank. Pardon me, that's my guess. Let's get going. Listen, there must be 30.000 people out at that racetrack right now. Oh, my, what a crowd. And I suppose you're going in looking for a girl weighing about 110 lbs... - ...and five feet four. - That's right. - How, by instinct? - Uh-huh. Listen. You saw this dame. Well, just a peek. - Was there a man with her? - Yes, but I didn't see him. But I could pick her out anywhere. Come on, Mr. Williams, you're holding me up.
