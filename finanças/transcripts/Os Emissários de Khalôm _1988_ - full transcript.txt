THE EMISSARIES OF KHALOM LISBON November 1860 This year's rainfall won't be worse than last year's. It started earlier, in the beginning of autumn. This means that it will be lighter during the winter. There are those who think that it will not be lighter but acid, and it's about to dissolve the foundations of the kingdom. We are a fairy tale nation. Wars are far away, in Italy, in Turkey, and the queen's ghost no longer darkens the king's days. Forgive me. I'm very sensitive to the oppression of the night. I wouldn't have come here if it wasn't for the insistent pleas of His Majesty, my dearest cousin, Don Pedro of Braganza. "Dearest cousin?" Lord Costigan is adviser to Queen Victoria of England on matters of high technology. My cousin... His Majesty, suggests that we hear his opinion on this delicate matter. Lady Brunélia, Baroness, there's no need to hear any more opinions. The expert's report is done. The risk is too great. The Lousal mine must be closed immediately. We know that the king trusts you, Professor Folque, but I would like to hear more voices. Yours, for instance, Mr. President. Professor Filipe Folque is the most capable geodetic engineer in this country. I can only agree with him. I disagree, Mr. President, Professor Folque, but the Lousal mines have to remain open. The Portuguese Empire is more at risk than people think. Wars are not that far, Baroness, and even fairy tale countries have to be prepared against them. Marshal, I ask you to examine the survey of the area one last time. This underground river intersects with the deposits of cuprite. The gallery walls will not withstand the water pressure in case of flood. And floods are more than predictable during this season. Worse... Hot mining releases hydrogen from the infiltrated water, which can cause explosions that will collapse the slope, burying the houses of all these towns and villages. Professor Folque's rains aren't light, and as the Baroness says: "They're about to dissolve the foundations of the kingdom." You know how to be gallant, Marshal. I write books and I like being quoted. The cataclysm that Professor Folque announced can be avoided. Lord Costigan confirms that his research laboratory is able to prevent such accidents. I wonder if the Lord's generosity is due only to his scientific spirit, or if there are ulterior motives. There is a deep bond between our king and Prince Albert of England. I have no doubt that His Majesty, Don Pedro V... Your cousin. ...my cousin, would be very pleased with the signing of an agreement between Lord Costigan's firm and the Royal Mines Company. A political commitment? As long as the mines don't close, it doesn't seem disgraceful to the nation. What? Selling innocent lives in exchange for a political stunt, isn't that dishonorable, Marshal? Or is it that for you, and for the Lord, human lives are only good to be wasted in wars, or in dubious experiments? It's a difficult matter. I am inclined to agree with Professor Folque. The baroness spoke of an agreement. The board is assembled. If we know the general terms of this agreement, we can vote. Lord Costigan's firm will assist with the research and technical support. In return, he will have exclusive use of everything that is extracted from the mine besides copper ore. You mean all the leftovers from the extraction? Precisely, Minister of the Kingdom. It's too good to be true. I'd like to know what's the catch. My vote is "no." The Lousal mine has to be closed immediately. First voter, Professor Filipe Folque, scientific advisor of the Royal Mines Company, votes "no" to the Lousal mine. The second voter, Marshal Sarmento de Castro, logistic consultant, votes... "Yes." ...votes "yes" to the continuation of the work in the mines. The Minister of the Kingdom, vice-president by virtue of office, votes... I think that closing the mines is out of the question, provided that the work can proceed safely. - Lord Costigan guarantees... - Not even God can give such a guarantee, my lady, let alone Lord Costigan. Mr. President, my vote is "yes." The vice-president votes "yes." I, the undersigned, president of the Royal Mines Company, vote... "no." Two yeses and two noes. Only the king can break the tie. And His Majesty will break the tie. There's no need. King Don Pedro V made me plenipotentiary president today, with a casting vote, which means two yeses and three noes. The mine will be closed. Mr. President, I hope that your reluctance to accept the British aid won't last. I didn't ask for the British aid. It was you who tried to impose it with the forced indulgence of His Majesty. Baroness, when Professor Folque warned me about the danger, 15 days ago, I telegraphed the Suez Canal Company immediately. It is public knowledge that this company started the greatest work of the century a year ago, opening a channel through 30 leagues of desert to connect the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. The answer arrived today, signed by the engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps himself. His best technician is on his way here. Mr. President, I fear that England will consider the meddling of France intolerable. The Royal Mines Company is still Portuguese. Lord Costigan's firm is a simple research laboratory, while Viscount Ferdinand de Lesseps is one of the world's leading specialists in this field. Gentlemen, thank you for your cooperation. - To whom do I owe the honor? - Verónica de Leuenroth, Viscountess of Lesseps on my father's side. You're the daughter of Viscount Ferdinand de Lesseps. - So, it's you who came to... - Yes. - Allow me to introduce myself. I'm... - I know who you are. Bachelor's degree in engineering from the Polytechnic Academy, member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, - Knight of the Order of Santiago... - My lady, please. Those are meaningless labels. There is one that matters: President of the Royal Mines Company. It was in that capacity that I telegraphed the Viscount, your father, but I never thought that help could come so quickly. Unfortunately, the technician was my husband. - "Unfortunately"? "Was"? - He died on the trip. My condolences, Viscountess. - Verónica. I hate formalities. - As you wish. I carry my husband's papers in the luggage, with all the calculations to solve your problem. All? But I sent a simple telegram, I didn't explain what it was. I'm very tired. Tomorrow I'll give you the documents. I'll send someone to escort you. Can you indicate a hotel for me to stay? I came alone. Alone? At this late hour? A hotel? Certainly, Viscountess. Verónica! No formalities. SERRA DA ESTRELA Do you want a little help? Did it fall with the wind? We're here to help you. Don't mind him, he's mute. His problem is the cold. We live in a cave. And our cave is freezing and we have no fire. Do you have fire? I can see that you have lots of fire. It's enough for two, at least. No. No, don't touch me. Don't touch me, I'll scream! - You can scream all you want. - Don't touch me! - Do you know what will answer you? - No! - No! - The echo. No! Don't touch me! And a little shouting will help us warm up. Don't touch me! I'll scream! Hello. What a surprise. - May I? - Come in. Eduardo, come and see who has arrived. Did you have a good trip? Now he's sculpting. No one can stop him. You came to spend the weekend with us? It'll do you good. You look pale and you have bags under your eyes. If you knew the scare I had on my way here. - What was it? An accident? - Almost. Well, nothing happened to you. That's what's important. Give me the key to get the car in the garage. - It shouldn't be outside freezing. - Thank you. Wait just a second, I can't let go of this. Done. Now I can greet you. Hello. Structuralist art? It's a model of an organic molecule. I'm glad you came, mostly because of Lúcia. She misses the children. They had to stay in Lisbon and she feels lonely. Eduardo, I haven't made 186 miles, plus the mountain and the snow, and a bunch of setbacks that I won't even speak of, just so your wife feels less lonely. Sorry for intruding. Do you want me to go back outside? Don't joke, Lúcia. Did they call from the research center? Yes. - Did they tell you I was on my way? - No. Well, we need a drink. Here's the key. - Who called you from the center? - It was Ferreira Campos himself. He told me there was danger, but we didn't talk much. The communication was awful due to the bad weather. I came to give you something that Ferreira Campos gave me. To protect you. To protect me? Me? What kind of thing? Ambrosia cocktail. It's Eduardo's favorite. I hope you like it too, Mariana. It's delicious. Thank you. Hello. Come in. Good afternoon. Am I intruding? Hi. Take a sit, have a drink. Thank you, a juice is enough. Ambrosia cocktail. I know, Dr. Veiga Rebelo's favorite. Have you met? We met on my way here. Then let me introduce you formally. Dr. Mariana Sousa Freire, psychologist, my colleague at the center. Our neighbor Valdemar, who lives three houses down. Pleased to meet you. - Mariana, are you staying? - If that's okay. It's too late to go to Lisbon. You'll stay in the children's room. Dr. Veiga Rebelo, do you mind if I fix your computer? That's why I came here. A key is stuck. I hope it's nothing serious. How did you know? Come on. Speak. What did Ferreira Campos give you to bring me? You can talk at ease. Don't ask me how, but he's perfectly aware of what we're doing. Did you see that model? He gave me the basic idea. If it works, I still don't know how, it will be an amazing discovery. Well... I brought you an instructions crystal with a complete ecobiotic programming. For me? What do you want to turn me into? We want to prevent you from becoming nothing. Last night, the maxicomputers made contact with a living being that existed 100 years ago. - A human being? - Yes. We finally got the answer to that problem. And what was the answer? - Suddenly, the nuclear disaster. - What? Again? You and your family are in imminent danger. With a push of a simple button, you'll be wrapped in a protective bubble of vaporized light. TLC, total comfort and efficiency. TLC, be on vacation in the midst of a nuclear war. TLC, the only shelter that gives you a guarantee of survival. I can't stand this damn advertisement anymore. And what was the answer? It was more than an answer. Eduardo, we're dealing with maxicomputers, with a complete super-intelligent decision-making ability. They went to root of the problem and they're manufacturing the solution. "Manufacturing the solution"? - They're creating physical things... - It's ready. I introduced some minor changes which will be very useful to you. Okay, thank you. After the rain, the weather turned out nice. Shall we go to the theater tonight? - And the Vilaverde's dukes reception? - The horror. I forgot. I'll have to put up with the Baroness again. Last night was enough for me. That and the stories of Dean Vieira, who was poisoned by the same lover three times now. We'll come up with something. To be caught in excellent health at the São Carlos Theater? Never. Classical opera is awful nowadays. The prima donna sings off-key, the orchestra has no rhythm, and the singers hesitate as in the village theaters. I suggest the Ginásio, where a French company is staging a vaudeville. I think that's great. Urgent? I'll see him here. Have coffee served for three. For three? A visit? It's João Carlos, my assistant. You already know him. My lady, Mr. Veiga Rebelo. Sit down. Have coffee with us. You were lucky you missed the meeting last night. Forgive me, I was a little sick. The sinister Baroness Brunélia de Aires almost got her way. What's the urgent matter that brings you here? The emissary arrived this morning. What emissary? From the company that is constructing the Suez Canal. I see, engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps' emissary. That one. You must be confused. The emissary is a woman. She didn't arrive this morning, she arrived last night and I've been with her. She promised to deliver the documentation today. Mr. Veiga Rebelo, I'm very sorry but the person I met this morning was certainly a man. A man? Did he identify himself? He gave this card. Viscount de Leuenroth, shareholder and chief geologist of the Universal Company of the Maritime Canal of Suez. Viscount de Leuenroth. The dead husband. - How? - Don't worry. He said he was going to meet you with the documents at five o'clock. Before that meeting at 5:00 p.m., I think I'll go to the Grand Hotel Central immediately to visit this gentleman's widow. Excuse me? There is a mystery to unravel. Will you excuse me, Paulina? My lady, may I? Greetings, Mr. Veiga Rebelo. What brings you to the Grand Hotel Central? I wish to speak with Viscountess Verónica de Leuenroth. I see, the viscountess... Viscountess Verónica de Leuenroth, this is João Carlos, my assistant. You arrived too early, Mr. Veiga Rebelo. Our meeting was at 5:00 p.m. Forgive me, Viscountess. Verónica. I don't remember scheduling any meeting for today. I don't know much about these matters. As I told you yesterday, my husband was the expert. It's yours. I would like to clear up a misunderstanding. I'm sorry, but I'm not prepared to answer any questions. Forgive me, but... Do you have any doubt about the death of Viscount de Leuenroth? What do you have to say about this card? Verónica. It's blank. Is it part of some parlor game? No. Sorry, my mistake. I gave you one of the cards that I use to take quick notes. They're very practical. But the truth is that I can't find it. There was an individual this morning... But my assistant João Carlos will explain it better. Mr. President, it may be an impostor. It might have been sent by the Baroness and the Lord to sabotage the negotiations with France. It has its logic. Well, I'll study this file first. Verónica, my duty calls. If I may. If you need me, you know where to find me. Watch out for the door! Thank you. It's you. You scared me. - I can't sleep. - Are you feeling unwell? It's after 4:00 a.m. - Do you need anything? - No. Did you think I was a burglar? Don't laugh, there have been lots of burglaries in the mountains. I guess so. Yesterday, if it wasn't for Valdemar... You had a weird reaction when he came over. It's just... If you saw the two thugs who attacked me when the car died. But, suddenly, that figure appeared in the snow. They ran away. It seemed they had seen the devil. - Or a god. - Two thugs? They must be the ones who are terrorizing the region. Did you say Valdemar scared them? I don't know how to explain it. I just know that his image was deeply engraved on me. I have to be cool-headed and calm. There's a very serious problem at the center. Eduardo's life is in danger. And yours, Lúcia. And your children's. Since when do you care about my life or my children's? Only since you saw Valdemar? Eduardo spends his days and nights with you at the center. You're just looking at the machines? - You're just looking at the machines? - Nonsense. There's never been anything between me and Eduardo, do you hear? Never. Remember that Eduardo and I have two small children to raise. I swear, Lúcia. I swear. Prove that you're telling the truth. Lúcia, how can I prove something that never happened? PORTUGUESE ROYAL MINES COMPANY Viscount de Leuenroth, shareholder and chief geologist of the Universal Company of the Maritime Canal of Suez. Send him in. Please, sit down. - Viscount de Leuenroth... - Excuse me, Valdemar de Leuenroth. The Viscount de Leuenroth, whose card I gave you, was my older brother. Your brother is the expert who is coming to... Was. Unfortunately he died during the trip. My condolences. I assume this file contains the necessary calculations - to solve the... - Indeed. Do you know that your brother's widow is here in Lisbon? My brother was never married. Do you happen to know a lady who uses or abuses your last name? I'm talking about a lady who says her name is... Verónica de Leuenroth. Well... I need to focus on your file. If you need to contact me, I'm at the Grand Central Hotel. Verónica and Valdemar at the same hotel. Both have the same last name. And they pretend not to know each other. Baroness, Mr. Valdemar de Leuenroth has just arrived. Mr. de Leuenroth, I'm making a very risky move coming to speak with you here, in such a public place. I came to defend the interests of a great friend of mine that absolutely ignores what I'm doing. I'm talking about Lord Costigan. You must have heard of him. Brunélia, do you mind if I don't address you as "Baroness"? I hate formalities. As you wish. Have we met before? Yes. We have met before. I know that you say Viscount Ferdinand de Lesseps sent you, the famous engineer of the Suez Canal. What I want, Mr. de Leuenroth... What I ask... is that you don't help in any way, that you don't interfere in the technical problem of the mine. That is easy. Tell me. Did Ferdinand de Lesseps sent you or not? No. - Do you defend the interests of France? - No. Great, I see that we can understand each other. You name, "Leuenroth," is it German? - Prussian. - Even better. The Queen of England just signed an alliance with Prussia in Coburg. The Lousal mine is the only one with slags rich in carborite, a mineral that could revolutionize the electric industry in the future. President Veiga Rebelo has to sign the contract with Lord Costigan's company. Whatever belongs to England will belong to its allies. It seems logical. Goodbye, Mr. de Leuenroth. Will we see each other again? At any time, Brunélia. Soon? Always. What were you saying? Sorry, I can't hear anything, I'm freezing. Come on, this is nothing. From the weather report, there will be a blizzard. Being stuck here would be no fun. What were you saying? One time, we were in the car, buried in the snow, unable to open the doors. We have a full pantry and fridge, we can endure for four days. That's not very encouraging, especially if there is a war. Nonsense. And of all things, it had to be the war. Lúcia, please try to understand. Eduardo and I are in a big trouble at the center. What were you thinking? Getting an atomic war program into a computer, as if it were a washing machine program. Blame it on all those movies and series about the nuclear threat. You know how it is. We were influenced and had the idea of introducing an innocent question: "How to rule out the hypothesis of a World War III?" For me, it's clear that everything's coming towards that. A definitive nuclear world war. Jesus! Three coffees. Do you know how many times a night Eduardo repeats, "We must stop the war, we must stop the war," in his nightmares? Just two days ago, I counted 63 times. It must be the influence of that damn ad. The TLC are open. Anti-nuclear, anti-radiation, anti-shockwaves, anti-heatwaves, anti-germs, anti-dandruff. Autonomy for six months. Self-renewing air, self-renewing food, self-renewing water, self-renewing occupants. TLC, the world's only 100% guaranteed shelter against total nuclear destruction. You're always making scenes. I don't find it funny. You're right. My nerves are shot. Let's go. I'll show you what Ferreira Campos and I found out. About the last century's living being. Programs in progress. This is ours. There's only one choice to avoid the planet's destruction. And that's where that character appears. Did you identify him? Yes. He's the main cause of the hypothetical, but possible World War III. Pay attention. After several searches, it suggests a date: November, 1860. We referenced a group of people, and the first one is decisive. Jacinto Emygdio de Veiga Rebelo. Wait a second. This is a famous ancestor of mine. Rebelo... Rebelo... The temperature keeps dropping. The tea is ready. Come quickly before it freezes. Here he is. Jacinto Emygdio de Veiga Rebelo. In 1860, he signed a contract between the Royal Mines Company and Mining Investigations from Manchester, resulting in some of the world's largest companies. Just imagine. My great-great-grandfather is involved in the next nuclear war. If I were you, I wouldn't find it funny. The energy beam we sent has got out of control and it's changing the time coordinates in order to eliminate your great-great-grandfather. Either way, he eventually died. Quite old and surrounded by children and grandchildren. But in 1860 he had just married, so there were no children at all. If Eduardo's great-great-grandfather is prematurely eliminated, my husband will suddenly cease to exist? No one knows. The program I brought you was the best we could do. The ecobiotic program? No, thank you. Do you know where Ferreira Campos is? Call the center in Lisbon. I'm sure he's there. INSTITUTE OF NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES RESEARCH AND TEST CENTER Hello? Go ahead. No, it's an ecobiotic program. It transfers your cells into a protective dimension, but you aren't transformed into a monster. Why should I go to hell? Okay, fine. Don't use it, throw it away. Bye. I already know what your question is, Mr. Director, and my answer is yes. It's the first nice thing I've heard in the last few days. - The results are in. - Thank you. What results? From a timed tracing. Tomorrow it'll be a pain in the neck, the meeting with the minister and the money men. Since you said yes, I'll face the sharks. They want practical and preferably quite industrial results. Okay, program one. The grafting of the artificial ZΩT virus into living cells of smooth muscle tissue. Reacts to telepathic stimuli. Excellent for making organic faucets. A simple thought and urethrae on the wall relax and spout water. Another thought and the urethrae contract. The water stops flowing. And... Do you think I can present that at tomorrow's meeting without getting laughs or budget cuts? Perfectly. Program two is inspired by the Podolsky paradox. The influence of high-energy particles over long distances. Practical application: the manufacture of biological marbles loaded with energy. For example, the factory is situated in Lisbon, and the marbles appear in Viseu or Tokyo. The range is infinite. It's as if space ceased to exist. Evidently, in order to achieve this effect, it is necessary to accelerate subatomic particles to nearly the speed of light. Program three is my priority. Do you want me to take over? Program three? So, we have a third program? GOAL MESSAGE - SYSTEM PRIORITY - MAXIMUM CODE - KHALOM Yes, Mr. Director, we have a third program, but not for tomorrow's meeting. Why? The name is too complicated. Say it. Interaction retro-induced by amplification of anti-structural impacts on chrono-predetermined bio-structures. What is it? An attempt to act on beings and events from the past, from the present. Action in time? Yes, we gave this program the code name "Khalom." It's a Hebrew word that means dream. It was a little joke from Dr. Mariana. Our colleague Veiga Rebelo found that the bioplasmic energy of dreams can project solid and vivid images, tens and hundreds of years before us. What's the resulting industry? If it goes wrong... the coffin industry. The sharks are hungry, Dr. Ferreira Campos. They're hungry. And what's the juicy steak that I have to offer? A boring factory of dingle-shaped telepathic taps and an unlikely back-and-forth of marbles between Lisbon and Tokyo. Send me the papers on all of this. I'll be eaten alive. José Manuel, how do you interpret this? It's the path of the energetic entity that the maxis sent to the 19th century. On a collision course with Eduardo's great-great-grandfather. What else? Nothing else. We sent a theoretical entity, a black body of total energy absorption, as stated in physics. A black body. A man in black. Harmless, you say? PORTUGUESE ROYAL MINES COMPANY I've got bad news for you, Jacinto Emygdio. Even if you lose trust in your old teacher, I honorably confess, this two files are impenetrable to me. You said that the carriers of these objects don't exist. No, that's not it. I sent a second telegraph to the Suez Canal Company. The answer arrived today. They sent a technician, but he died in an accident during the trip. That detail is confirmed. But his name wasn't Leuenroth, nor was he a viscount, nor did he have any brothers. And Engineer Lesseps has no daughter called Verónica. Both folders have only these pictures, as you can see. Impenetrable. Not a single word, not a single number. When you listen carefully, the file with the red engravings seems to make a weird noise, like an invisible mechanism. Which one was delivered by the woman and by the man? I didn't mark them, I can't tell them apart. On the outside, they are strictly the same. João Carlos, what happened? - Do you want me to call someone? - No, don't bother. At this hour, the building is empty. And I'm fine, don't worry. Thank you. No. You don't seem to have any serious injuries. It was just the shock. - I'm feeling better now. - Were you robbed? No, Mr. President. But I fulfilled the mission you assigned me. Have you succeeded? Yes. I went to the Grand Hotel Central and... I started by confirming that a lady who signs as Viscountess de Leuenroth, and a man who signs as Valdemar de Leuenroth are staying on different floors. Interesting. And then what? After an hour waiting, I saw the Viscountess come down. She went outside and I followed her quietly, until she entered Santo Estevão Monastery's crypt. And now you can admire our most valuable piece of treasure, the 240,000 year old sword. It was found in a tomb, buried at an incalculable depth. This metal is not even 6,000 years old, let alone 240,000. Underground infiltrations would've oxidized and broken it. The tomb was found in Persia while digging a grave to bury ten adulterous women alive. It went from Persia to Egypt. And from Egypt... It was a personal gift from Viscount Ferdinand de Lesseps to our museum of rarities. He wouldn't be fooled by the false brightness of this metal. If the sword is a fake, too bad. Santo Estevão Monastery rejects it. Go ahead, destroy it with your own hands. Don't go, João Carlos, I have a mission for you. Dance, demons, but not in my woods! There's a demon among us. She! Woman, or whatever you are, leave this holy place. Don't believe what he says. I know this lady. João Carlos, I have a mission for you. Viscountess. Mr. de Leuenroth. I know that you weren't sent by Ferdinand de Lesseps. Who sent you? We came from Khalom. The city of shadows. The city of dreams. You came together? You are perhaps spies. - Nothing can hurt us. - Nothing? Maybe the 240,000 year old sword will prove otherwise, pseudo-ghosts. Don't touch that sword. It came from Khalom, just like us. The truth, impostors... When I came to myself, I was inside a calash, between the Viscountess and Mr. de Leuenroth. They left me here at the door. Now I can move my arm better. Did they go there to meet each other? I got it. She knew she was being followed and she lured João Carlos on purpose. This mysterious opposition to the English agreement makes me think. Can they be French agents? I almost forgot. Before you go, both of them gave me one of these bags, saying, "Give it to Mr. Veiga Rebelo, so that the will of the will that sent us may be fulfilled." Don't touch them. Let me check if they contain anything dangerous. A real sapphire... and a pigeon blood ruby. What a transparency! Magnificent specimens! Do those insolents intend to bribe me with a couple of gems? At least, Baroness Brunélia always knew how to keep herself within the confines of politeness. I'm beginning to sympathize with the idea of signing the agreement with Lord Costigan's firm from Manchester. What option do you have, Jacinto Emygdio? I suggest that they become the property of the Mines Company. I hope this damp wood catches fire. You are better than me at collecting firewood. I have a lot of practice. I'm going to light the fire. Don't take too long, it gets dark very quickly here. - See you. - Bye. Hello. Are you alright? I always felt good when I'm close to you. You're exaggerating. We only met two or three times. Much more than that, Brunélia. Brunélia? Brunélia, Mariana, Silmara... What's the importance of names when they're all the same name? You have to explain yourself better. I don't know how to decipher riddles. I'd like to tell you about Khalom. Do you know the name of our code? It's a wonderful city. Khalom, the city of dreams. It existed 240,000 years ago. I didn't know. A city? - It must have been a coincidence. - It wasn't a coincidence. It was memory. It's a city of pure gold... surrounded by a wall of crystalline jasper. It has 12 doors and each door is made of a single pearl. In its center, the tree of life grows. There will be peace there. Did you know it? Always. We both always knew it, Mariana. What a strange way to talk to a technocrat like me. I was programmed to be greatly, totally in love with you. Programmed? Don't make fun of me. I take the word "technocrat" back. What's happening to us is very absurd. It can do us more harm than good. Especially to you. Don't be afraid. Let it out. I had a eight year old son who died. Recently? I've been talking about it for so long like it wasn't my thing. It was right after my divorce. I became obsessed. You know how it is... A marriage that falls apart like this. My little child. He stayed with me and it was like he lost his mother. I just lived and relived my pain as a woman. He got sick. I don't know if it was because I was so upset. He was already burning up with fever when I called the doctor. Too late. I lost him for a moment of stupid selfishness. But even remorse has already been taken by the oblivion. See, I'm hurting you. I'm not good company for anyone. Don't say that. There is always another understanding of what peace is. Another harmony. More truthful. More beautiful. Well... I should go. They're waiting for the firewood back home. Bye. A fulminating apoplexy. There's no solution. I'm prescribing a solution based on quinine and calcined magnesia in a boiled water suspension. Doctor, what my husband has... Is it serious? No. Just a quartan fever. There's no reason to be apprehensive. With my respects, Mrs. Paulina... See you tomorrow. My dear Paulina, I overslept. I'm ravenously hungry. Please have breakfast brought to me. Jacinto. Thank you for coming, João Carlos. Viscountess. Verónica. It makes me very happy to be able to see you, to be with you. I came to this country with the mission of speaking to Mr. Veiga Rebelo, but when I saw you, I knew it was you I wanted to meet. I know, Verónica. I know from the first moment. And when was the first moment for you? It was... Well, it was... Sorry. I can't quite recall. I remember it was... Or maybe it was... in another place. A long time ago. A long time ago. Or maybe not. Sorry, I'm very confused. But one thing is certain, Verónica. I love you. I love you so much. I was programmed to be greatly, totally in love with you. Programmed? I don't understand. I'll have to return to Khalom when my mission is accomplished. Will you abandon me? There's no hope? Promise me one thing. If, by any chance, Mr. Veiga Rebelo has a serious accident, burn the file with all the documents I gave you. Burn everything. The file? But... which one? Which one? Don't worry. It's the old duke. The Duke of Vilaverde is preparing for the duel. Joaquim, that target... More to the right. No, you fool. It's not to your right, but to my right. Lower. Closer to the belly. That's it. And don't be afraid, I still have an eagle eye. He never hits the target. He might kill the servant. There's no danger. The butler loads his pistols with blanks without anybody knowing. He's old and crippled, and he's fighting a duel? He has been preparing for this duel for 25 years. He never wanted to believe that the opponent died accidentally, a few hours before the meeting. Here. What is it? Don't be a coward, Joaquim. That was a minor scratch. Put iodine in it and bring Venâncio tomorrow. Verónica. Verónica! I forgot that this is where the Duke of Vilaverde comes to practice. Sorry, dear, I brought you to a walk that could have been fatal to us. Let's go home, please. I don't know what this feeling is. There's something chasing us. Chasing us? Only if it's my assistant, João Carlos. GOAL MESSAGE - SYSTEM PRIORITY - MAXIMUM CODE - KHALOM INSTITUTE OF NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES RESEARCH AND TEST CENTER Nothing. It's urgent that Eduardo comes back. He hasn't said anything? It's ringing. Do you want me to turn on the Ampliphone? Yes. Eduardo? Eduardo, are you listening? Yes. I can barely hear you, but I can hear you. - Is it you, Ferreira Campos? - Yes, it's me. I can barely recognize your voice. We have news of vital importance. It's 9:00 a.m. What are you still doing there? We are buried in snow. What? Up to the roof. It's impossible, everything is frozen. The worst thing was the shock when we woke up. But we're all right now. Yes, we called for help. Nothing can be done. Even the bulldozers and the snowplows were buried. The firewood we have won't last a day. Then we'll freeze to death. I can't hear you. The connection is awful. - Do you have a heater? - You stayed overnight. There's only a tiny one. It's no good. - Then, the situation is rough. - And the kids broke the others. I understand, but there's no way. Eduardo? Only you and Mariana know how to work with bioplasm. Yes. But we are trapped more than 190 miles away. Isn't there a trapdoor in the roof? - By the way... - Nothing. ...I have an amazing prose before my eyes. Can you tell me what are these things on the monitor? - What things? - Sigma Computers Incorporated... Sorry, I didn't get it. Say it again. Sigma Computers Incorporated, Rosenbank Organization, Scientific Liaison... Are you reading the same thing I have here? - How is it possible? - Don't ask me. I can only tell you that my computer is acting as a terminal of your system. Do you remember when Valdemar came here to fix the computer? He said he made a modification that would be very useful to you. This was it. Listen, besides being technically impractical from there, if it's true, it's strictly... - Forbidden. - ...forbidden. Dr. Ferreira Campos, this clandestine communication that I'm realizing... Is it part of a new program? Mr. Director, I know that the sharks will arrive at any moment. You have a lot of papers for them to swallow, but now we have an emergency situation that needs to be solved. Dr. Veiga Rebelo's last century ancestors are in danger of being suppressed. If they disappear, it's not just him and his family that will cease to exist. It's worse. The diachronic wave of influence that he spread will cease to exist. Much of what feeds your dear sharks has been created by him. The idea of creating this center and the major discoveries are due to him. If he suddenly ceases to be part of our universe, it's probable that you'll no longer be the director, and you'll be in an obscure shop serving obscure customers, behind an obscure counter. Bravo, Ferreira Campos. Sorry, Mr. Director, I still haven't said "good morning." Good morning, Dr. Veiga Rebelo. That manipulation of yours is changing, distorting the past, and gigantic waves of energy clash somewhere, outside of space and time. The planet is about to shatter... And you were worrying about a harmless nuclear war. I'll pretend and ignore this unusual illegality, as long as it results in an industrially viable project. Don't forget your papers, Mr. Director. That's all. More results are coming in. Ferreira Campos, are you listening to me? Yes. You still haven't explained what this is. Circumstances. We're tracking all the consequents of the 1860's consortium, even the most remote. Look. This Anglo-Portuguese consortium which resulted from the signing of the 1860's agreement no longer exists, but it has left ramifications everywhere over the last 100 years. Newspapers, banks, hotels, research institutions, cinema, television, military technology, plastics, even religious organizations. And what do you conclude? We suspect that there's a worldwide super-organization and all of this is just a front. It's the vertex of the vertices. And it constitutes the answer to the main question. You mean the shady organization that will press the red button one day. What about the emissary in black? Don't hang up. José Manuel, I want all the data about the emissary in black that our stupid maxis sent to the 19th century. - All of it? - All of it. I was told someone tried to bribe you, Mr. President, with two invaluable gems. A ridiculous incident to forget. I'm a romantic and gems fascinate me. Even if they are just literary gems. Among which are your books. I am sorry for not having read the last one you published. Fallen Leaves. No. Flying Petals. Unpretentious notes from my travels. I am very sorry. Please. As I said, gems fascinate me. I came to offer you two gemstones that will delight you. Not as a bribe, that's a word I hate, but as a reward. I don't get why. As a reward for knowing you are inclined to sign the agreement with Lord Costigan's Mining Investigations. It's pure speculation for now. Maybe it is, maybe not. Here's the first gem. A telegram? The French envoy from Viscount of Lesseps, the real one, did not die in an accident. He was murdered. A hit by Turkey, which wants to rule alone in Egypt. Just one of the many hits against France and England that begin to be united in the same interests. With this gem, Mr. Veiga Rebelo, I intend to alleviate your scruples about offending France, if you sign an agreement with England. There are still the false emissaries. Could they be spies from a distant power? And here's the second gem. I love harmony and I'm far from being the perverse creature that many are fantasizing about. The first letter proves that your assistant João Carlos is madly in love with the mysterious Viscountess Verónica. The second one proves that your wife Paulina never had any affection toward your poor assistant, as Dr. Veiga Rebelo so often imagined. And she loves only you... Unconditionally. You are a happy man. Sorry. Forgive me, Paulina. I was crazy. Verónica and João Carlos. Paulina innocent. Damn you, Brunélia, you almost bribed me with this gift. Spies? From where? From whom? The heart stopped. Send for the doctor, quickly. Promise me one thing. If, by any chance, Mr. Veiga Rebelo has a serious accident, burn the file with all the documents I gave you. Burn everything. Doctor, I'm glad you arrived. Give me some camphor to smell, I have a terrible headache. The files? Where are the files that were here? - No, they're both gone. - Did they leave a message? Mr. de Leuenroth to Baroness Brunélia. This one is for you, from Viscountess Verónica. Hello? Ferreira Campos? Can you hear me? Ferreira Campos? Do you hear me? - Hello? Ferreira Campos? - There's no need to panic. I heard a helicopter go by a while ago. They must have no visibility to get us out of here. Get us out of here, how? They'll open a hole in the roof and ruin our lovely home? I have a feeling that Valdemar has already found a way to help us. Is this the synthetic entity that you say it's our envoy? Yes. I gave her life. No, you idiot, it was Eduardo and Mariana's calculations, and the circuits of those monsters which work day and night chewing over who knows what. You're wrong! I changed Eduardo's calculations! No way! I'm tired of him being first in everything. The one with the best ideas, who solves the worst problems. There was a time when I even envied Lucia, but now I don't need to envy anything. You'll recognize my genius. Do you know the story of that famous king of Cyprus? Pygmalion. He made an ivory statue. A statue of a woman, of incomparable beauty, that he admired every night, lost in love, by the light of a silver lamp. Calm down. You need a vacation. We'll fix the blunder you made. You can't. It's irreversible. - We'll cut the power to the computers. - It's useless. The projected energy is beyond our reach. Aphrodite gave life to the Pygmalion statue, the beautiful Galatea. I created the statue. I gave her life. And I programmed her to fall in love with me as soon as she saw me. It's getting crazier. Did you also change Mariana's formulas? No, just Eduardo's. You don't know the laws of biotics! Right now, your Galatea is in love with you and Mariana at the same time. We're here with this crazy talk while they're locked in the ice. We have to do something. For now, let's try to stop the destructive actions of this envoy, before she pulverizes the 19th century, the 20th century and the planet. It is not usual for Mr. Veiga Rebelo to be late. The call is very clear. Does anyone know why our president changed attitude towards the agreement with the English? He probably had no alternative. The mine is closed, but we have to recognize that the losses are great. - That's all? - No. There is, above all, a rather obvious secret. The reason why the English want the slags from the Lousal mine. Exactly. They contain a very high content of carborite, an ore that could give a tremendous boost to the increasingly powerful electricity industry. Well, if so, let's conclude the agreement. We will at least be sharing the future British high tech. Don't be so sure of that, if I know the English. In any case, let us conclude the agreement. Come in. Any news? An accident in one of our copper foundries. A boiler blew up and the molten metal scattered, hitting our president who was visiting the site. It seems he's severely burned. - Mariana. - Thank you. It's good, thank you. I don't want any more either. There's more coffee in there. It's already normalized. Good. That model is very unusual. I don't even know how to classify it. Ask Valdemar, since he was the one who suggested it. Yes, next time I see him. If there is a next time. Carbon and silicon atoms in a chemically impossible arrangement. And the result is something complicated, solid and liquid at the same time, capable of transmitting heat and electrical currents of thought. Perhaps even currents of thought and emotion. You mean a synthetic life. A life form that could only be created by the maxis of our Center. I have an idea. - Who knows if... - Hello? Eduardo? Can you hear me, Eduardo? It's Ferreira Campos. Yes, it's me, Eduardo. - Hello? - Eduardo! - Hello? - Finally. Here's the information you asked for. Our bio-energetic envoy, unlike angels, has a sex. It's a female and it's not an angel. It keeps triggering elimination actions against your great-great-grandfather. Actions that take the form of bizarre accidents. I find it weird that computers had the refinement of creating a cybernetic organism with sex. It was José Manuel's craziness. I'll explain later. However, the accidents are failing. That's good. But they should. It's a mathematically strange deviation. There's something "good" here, interfering. Great. See if you can help that "good" protect my great-great-grandfather. You're being selfish. What if a nuclear war breaks out? - Breaks out? - ...total comfort and efficiency. TLC, be on vacation in the midst of a nuclear war. TLC, the only shelter - that gives you a guarantee... - As a last resort, we have the famous TLC shelters. Wait. TLC... - TLC, where have I seen that? - A million times a day. In all the newspapers and on TV. No, not only that. TLC... That indicator has come up with the latest tracings. You're right. Enter the codes. I want to see a synthesis of everything we've investigated. Programming errors that can possibly trigger a global thermonuclear war: entirely speculative. Major news agencies that spread and exaggerate the news. Funded by: TLC. American-Soviet peace meetings for disarmament, SALT, Geneva, Vienna, Helsinki, Reykjavik, sabotaged by disturbing elements. Funded by: TLC. Small groups of fake businessmen distribute enriched uranium to terrorist organizations in the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Central America, South America. Funded by: TLC. Speculative news manufactured by: TLC. Movies and television series that explore the effects of a hypothetical nuclear catastrophe. All produced by firms subsidized by: TLC. Ferreira Campos, you understand, don't you? I think so. So this was the result of that 19th century Anglo-Portuguese consortium. What does our psychologist say? I say it's Columbus' egg. A global thermonuclear war is so undesirable that it's impossible. This paranoia is pure emotional and commercial exploitation. The more primal the emotions, the better they are explored. Buy bomb shelters! The great imaginary danger is invented and the terrified populations buy the shelters, that would be of no use to them if there was such a serious war. And I ask, as in detective novels: Who is taking advantage of the danger? Who wins at the expense of those who buy? Suddenly, the nuclear disaster. You and your family are in imminent danger. With a push of a simple button, you'll be wrapped in a protective bubble of vaporized light. TLC, total comfort and efficiency. TLC, be on vacation in the midst of a nuclear war. TLC, the only shelter that gives you a guarantee of survival. Eduardo. But why? Why did you deceive me? I never deceived you, Brunélia. I always said I love you. You misled me about your mission. I thought you were defending England's interests. I never claimed that. Maybe not, but you implied it. You have a beautiful loyalty to Lord Costigan. I no longer think of him as my future husband, not since I've known you. Please, I ask you once more, don't leave. Look what the doctor said, you're deeply burned. You can get an infection. Paulina, my dear, the contract has to be signed today. Don't worry. Nothing will happen to me. I love you so much. You have no idea how I suffered for thinking that... You're burning up with fever. My God, wait until tomorrow. Going like this at night, it's crazy. It was Lord Costigan himself who suggested it and I accepted. According to English law, contracts signed after lunch are not valid. But, by now, the lord must have already evaporated all the beer he's been drinking during the day. Have you come to say goodbye, João Carlos? I want to leave with you, Verónica. Knowing that makes me happy. But I don't want to see you suffer. I will not abandon you. We will live together forever in Khalom, the city of dreams. The city of the dead. No. The city of dreams. Verónica, I will not abandon you. What's gotten into you? How stupid we were. We just had to look, it's so obvious. What? Did you solve it? Is there no more danger? Everything is crystal clear. Say it, quickly. We're all looking forward to opening the champagne bottles. The formula... The formula that defines our bio-energetic envoy comprises a square root. Like this. Square root of K equals plus or minus V. Any number, whatever it is, always has two symmetric square roots. One positive and one negative. That's how Paul Dirac discovered antimatter and won the Nobel Prize. Okay, but don't be so full of yourself. What does it mean? It means that the Khalom's code didn't send one emissary to the 19th century, but two. Two. Plus V, minus V. Two emissaries? One is already a headache, two will be chaos. There are two! And what is this worth to us? As they have opposite polarities, one is a man and the other is a woman. We managed to obtain the woman's image, but we still know nothing about the man. Valdemar. What did you say? Is the difference between the two just a sex difference? Looks like one is "good" and the other is "bad." Hence the interferences we detected. The bad one tries solve the problem by killing Eduardo's great-great-grandfather, while the good one prefers to use more subtle tactics, even foiling the other. Hurry up with that. Don't you want to call for help again? What for? They don't answer. They must be blocked, like us. The environment is starting to freeze. Who's bad and who's good? Ferreira Campos, listen to me carefully. Mariana gave me an idea a while ago. I have a model of a molecule composed of silicon and carbon in front of me. Silicon and carbon? But that is the common carborundum. No, it's much more complex. It's a highly energetic life form. Fortunately my computer is connected to your system. I'll computerize the code if there are no more power failures. As soon as you receive it, tell José Manuel to transfer it through time and see if he hits both emissaries, before the world starts to break. You look pale. What's up? You look like you've just seen a ghost. Brunélia, I beg you, do not disturb me. Take this. It will protect you. Now I need to focus. Keep it to protect yourself. And now, please don't disturb me. I need to focus. We are 15 minutes ahead. Let's review the clauses or... No, we'll wait for Lord Costigan's memorandum. Do you want me to call a doctor, Mr. President? No, it's not necessary. I would however thank you, Minister, the courtesy of pouring me a glass of water. At this hour, there is only one employee here. I think I'd better go down to the door and wait for the lord. Mr. President, do you mind to be alone for a moment? Go, I'm fine. You may go. No! Let go of me! Let me go! I'm not going to enter this data or press these damn buttons! I won't kill my Galatea! Screw Eduardo's great-great-grandfather! No. I'm not going to send all this energy. You want me to make them disappear, but I won't! Let me go! No! Eduardo, Mariana? Do you hear me? - Yes, what's happening? - Trouble. José Manuel has gone mad. He fell in love with the emissary in black and he refuses to send the high energy stimuli from your molecular model. Let me speak to José Manuel. I doubt he'll hear you. The Englishman is late and I don't have egg white. Egg white? Bizarre thought. Egg white is the most effective antidote against the corrosive sublimate. Corrosive sublimate? A horrible death in a few seconds. I'm thirsty, very thirsty. I'll die if I don't drink. But there is a force... ...which stops me. This one is no longer of any use. We need to do something before the house collapses. And before we freeze to death. Where are the blankets? Go to the bedroom and bring all the blankets. Okay. Stop being stupid. Only you know how to work with this type of computerization. Insert this in your computer. Can you hear me? José Manuel, can you hear me? This is Mariana. Can you hear me, José Manuel? I know what your problem is. We all have problems. The same, worse, less worse. But you don't have the right. We have no right to think that our problem is unique. We are at the end, José Manuel. Did you hear? José Manuel, answer me. Your ideas about the paradoxes of time are naive, José Manuel. If Eduardo's great-great-grandfather is killed by the negative emissary, Eduardo doesn't disappear. But the energy that supercharges our envoys will surely make everything and everyone explode. A thousand times worse than a nuclear war, if it's not transmuted immediately. Paulina, my dear, you will never be alone or helpless. I swear. Why is this water so far away from me? It has to be done. Okay. It has to be done. Eduardo! My God, Eduardo, what's up? Mr. President! He's dead. One hundred years ago, I beat you. Today I am changed. I look around and everything I see seems very beautiful. Love has transformed you. I know. Why aren't you close to your creator? Your only love. Neither time nor space can separate us. You and I will die now. Then... I will fly to him. Encoding completed. Great. Now shoot. What's going on? Mind you, Minister of the Kingdom, with the fever, I dreamed that I had died, that the contract was not signed and that the messengers of God had left this world. Don't pay any attention. Sit down, gentlemen. Let's read Lord Costigan's memorandum. Valdemar, what miracle was this? Pure energy, light, life. It gave me a soul and accelerated time. The world doesn't know but 15 days have passed. Time enough to melt the snow that buried the house. Galatea? No... Verónica. There's something I don't understand. You around here? João Carlos, has anybody ever told you... João Carlos? José Manuel. Has anybody ever told you... ...that life is an infinite ocean of beautiful colors, which nothing can destroy, and where everything exists in everything? So there's no death? No. There's life and love. Subtitles: deadlyjinx
