Clara! Right on time. I know, Mom. I'm so sorry! The roads are a mess. They always are this time of the year. - That's why I asked you to come early. - I know. - Wow! Mom! - Hmm? - This is so beautiful. - Hmm. I think this is your best one ever. It has to be. I'm being featured in Seasons Magazine for Christmas. -You are? -Mm-hmm. Wow! I love these windows. - It's Bonnie. - But of course. Hey, Bonnie. Yeah, Bonnie, slow down. Well, yeah, it's Christmas. We always get slammed. Again? Yeah, sure. I'll be right in. -Mom. -Mm-hmm? I'm really sorry, but I have to go. You're really wasting your talents there, sweetheart. Can we have a rain check on baking those cookies? Oh, no! Your mother waits for no one, first born or otherwise. How do you think your father became so punctual? He was pretty punctual. -Mm-hmm. -I love you. -I love you too. Be careful. -I will. -Bye. -Bye. Right there. Yes, perfect. Welcome back to Can You Stand The Heat! We started with 50 super celebrity chefs, and managed to whittle it down to just three! So, who's it gonna be? Mike Mahoney... ...whose big talent is second only -to his big mouth? -Big Mike! What's that catchphrase? Let's get cooking! Mike is in the house, baby! That's right! Whoo! Or Sharl Shaunnessy? The only baker who has what it takes to rise to the top. Tortured artist of cakes and pastries alike. Or will it be Manhattan's hottest celebrity chef, restaurateur and bachelor, Shane Roarke? Huh? Huh? Let's see it! Let's see! Ah, ah, ah! Yeah, there it is! Well, we've waited so long for the best of the best to slice and dice, and sift it out. And now for the winner... Sharl... Oh, man. You are... -not the winner! -Oh, come on! I'm sorry. I'm out of here. This is. These two wouldn't know the difference between a puff pastry and a Danish pastry. See you later, squids. What the . You can't say that on TV. And this year's "Can You Stand the Heat" celebrity champion is... Shane Roarke! Oh, my God! Guys? - Guys? - Amazing! -Oh! He's so inspiring-- -Guys! If you're looking for something to do, maybe your jobs could use a little attention? Yeah, I know, but we have a really big day, so, we need to get going. Like now. Thank you. Oh, Clara, you might as well own this place. Oh, no, I am happy managing. Yeah, but your restaurant in Chicago was great. I mean, I could just imagine what you'd do to this place. Well, enough about that. Let's just worry about these guests. Shane won! -Good for Shane. -Everyone loves Shane. I have a table of seven coming in. -Can you please help me set up? -OK. -Thank you. -He's really cute, though. Remember that name, folks! Shane Roarke! He's the country's most famous chef, and most eligible bachelor. Breaking eggs... And breaking hearts. Shane Roarke, everybody. -Here we are. -Thank you. Here we go. - Great. Thank you. - Enjoy. -Thanks. -Hey, when you get a chance, could you run some garlic bread to table three. -Absolutely. You're welcome. -Thank you. Yeah, just go with the cab. Perfect. How is everything? Good. Your server will be with you in just a minute. Thank you. How is everything over here? Hey! We don't have all day here! I'll be right there, sir. - I'm not 100 percent sure, but... - What are you doing? I think that guy wants you... You think? Hey, can I get two glasses of red please? Thank you. -Don't clap at the waitress. She's-- -I'm getting it done. -Shush. I got this one. -Don't shush me! How can I help you? I ordered a rare steak and it's not bleeding. Well, you certainly seemed to have enjoyed the first half of it. Yeah, but, I didn't love it. Shouldn't I love my steak... Clara? Well, I'm afraid I can't guarantee you love on this steak, but I can get you a new steak. Rare, extra bloody. Touchdown! Oh, wow. Well, the date is over, and I am so sorry about... that. Um... Is there a taxi stand outside? I'll just... I'll be back in just a minute. I bet you're glad to be back, huh? Over the moon. Ah, I can't wait to get home. I'm exhausted. I know. Me too. OK, but first I gotta use the bathroom. - Again? You just went to the bathroom. - Yeah, I gotta go again. Have you been stealing cheese from the kitchen again? So? - So, you're lactose intolerant. - No, I'm not. Cheese just makes my stomach - gurgle a little bit. - Right. My bad. -Enjoy your cheese. Yeah. Go. -Can you hold my bag? Hi, how are you? I'm just checking in. Can I help you with this? -Oh, thank you. -Oh, don't mention it. - This isn't actually my cheese. - Right. Well, this is a nice piece of Gruyère. It's still not mine. It's... um... - It's not mine. - A friend's. Yeah. Uh... Anyway, uh... enjoy your stay at Thunder Mountain. Thank you, um... Clara. Right. It's... on my necklace. It is. Yeah. - Well, have a good night. - You too. Bye. -Do you know who that is? -Mm-hmm, yup, mm-hmm. - It's Shane-- - Shh, shh, shh. -It's Shane Roarke! -I know. I know. You know, from that reality show earlier! - Yeah. - He's standing-- Here's here! Oh, he's even more handsome in real life. Did he make a pass at you? No, Bonnie, he handed me your cheese. Come on. Great. Shane Roarke is staying at our resort! Well, you know, it's not really our resort. Oh, do you think he'll come to the restaurant? Yeah. He might. He might. If I were Shane Roarke and I went to our restaurant -what would I order? -Pizza! Yes! Pizza! I mean, if he's the perfect man, which we know he is, he would get pizza. Let's do it! Right. Guys, right here. Christmas is just around the corner. And if Thanksgiving was any indication, I think we can expect it to be at least twice as busy this year. Now, I have a very exciting announcement to make. To help with the busy season, and perhaps some marketing opportunities, I've hired a new head chef, starting today. He's a huge talent. Shane Roarke. Come out, buddy! Oh! It's Shane Roarke! He's not a guest! - He's with us! - Uh-huh. Yup. Now, I know Shane wanted to get started meeting all of his staff. And we all have a lot of work to do getting ready for Christmas. So, let's welcome Shane, and make him feel at home. Thank you. - Hi. Clara. We met last night. - Hi. Of course, yeah. The cheese girl. Actually, no, I'm cheese girl! Yeah, I know, that was my purse cheese. But who cares? I'm Bonnie. And you're Shane. Hi, Bonnie. Yeah, Clara was holding my purse. Oh! Well, that's very nice of her. She thinks I'm lactose intolerant, but I don't think I am. Bonnie, remember we talked about first impressions? OK. Uh, I mean, that's great to know, if I'm ever preparing something for you in the kitchen. Yeah. It was nice to meet you. Uh-huh. Huh. Wow! No, that guy needs to take it down a notch with the flirting. Yeah? Was he flirting with you? Oh! You like him, don't you? What? Don't be ridiculous. Oh, you do like him. I can tell. You know what, I'm going to see if he likes you. No, please don't. You can count on me. I didn't even say I liked him. Bonnie! I'm waiting on that pizza... How are we doing with those scallops? Order's up. Enjoy your food. I think you will all love it. -That was... -Jeans! -Excuse me. -But also skiing too. It's-- I don't understand why he does that everytime. OK. Sorry, I'll be right back. -It's not fun. -Have fun with that. Hello. I'm the manager here. I heard you asked to see me. My name is Clara. How's everything today? Can we grab you some more drinks? More drinks! What a great idea, Claire! - Oh, It's Clara. - Oh! -Uh, I'm Janice. -And I'm the other Janice! Janice and Janice. Two Janices! We are just a couple of single girls on vacation here in the mountains. And we happened to notice that your new chef is... - Shane Roarke! - Oh, I'm afraid I can't really be much help. I don't know him -that well-- -We feel like we know him personally. So, we were wondering if you could ask Shane if he'd like to come out and say hello? I mean, we would love to meet him. Oh, sure. I mean, he's pretty busy... -Thank you! -Thanks. Shane Roarke. She's gonna get... - Shane! Hi. - Hi. Um... -Hi. Clara. Hi. -Hi. Clara. Hi. -Yeah, now, we've officially said hi. -Yeah, we have. Um, I'm--I'm really sorry to bother you, but I have a table of young ladies. They asked if you could drop by to say hello. I told them you were busy. So, I can just-- No, no, no. It's fine. I'll--I'll head over. Peters says I'm never too busy to butter up customers, so, I'll... I'll head over. OK. Their names are Janice and Janice. I'm sorry? -Janice and Janice. Yeah. -Two Janices! Wow! Sounds interesting. Yeah, well, they kind of freak me out, but they're very excited to see you. Oh, OK. Well, tell them I'm very excited to see them. - OK. - OK. Thanks. - I'll head out. - OK. Good afternoon, ladies. -Hi. -Hi. -How are you? Shane. -Janice. Janice? Very nice to meet you, Janice. And? - Janice. - You're both Janice? Wow. He is so smooth. Isn't he smooth, Clara? Who? Oh, sure, pretend you don't know. I'll play along. Shane! Hang on a second. Oh, yeah. I guess he's smooth. Hi, Mr. Peters. Hi, Bonnie. Clara? Shall we? Sure. I'll be right there, Hugh. -Hugh? -Yeah, that's his name. Really? I thought it was Peters. You thought he went by mister, and then his first name? OK, don't change the subject. What's he mean, "Shall we?" Shall we what? Shall we mind our own business, maybe? Mr. Hugh? All right, guys. Why don't we take a little bit of a break? Right? We've got a busy night. Cool. Good work. Thank you. Chef, very nice on the fryer, by the way. Thanks, chef! OK, enough about the schedule. -Yeah. -I want to talk to you about this project. What he have... -A little soda on the rocks. -Thank you. So, you're pretty smooth over there with your lady fans. Hmm. Oh, yeah. They were, uh, they were interesting, that's for sure. Fun fact, they're both named Janice. - Wow. - Yeah. -That is interesting. -Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well, I bet you have a lot of lady fans, huh? Argh! Yeah. I guess. OK, I see -where this is headed. -What? I should probably tell you I have a boyfriend. Just to be clear. -Oh! OK. Yeah, thank-- -Yeah. -Thank you. -He is, uh... a city planner. -His name is Clive. -Nice. You know, Bonnie and Clive. Like Bonnie and Clyde. Only instead of Clyde it's... - Clive. - Clive. Yeah. I mean, that's lovely. So, what's up with you and Clara? You guys been friends a long time, or what? Oh, best friends since we were little kids. -Oh, really? -Yeah. We both grew up here in Thunder Valley. I never left, but Clara went to Chicago for a few years to open up her own restaurant. -Oh, really? -Yeah. It was a really nice place, too. It just didn't quite work out like she planned, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know, Chicago's a tough market. But anyways, now she's back, totally alone, and no boyfriend to speak of. So, there's no city planner then? -No? -No. Yeah. Anyone could just ask her out, and she'd probably say yes. OK. Oh, so, what's going on with her and Peters over there? -Really? -Yeah. OK. Now... Oh! No, there's nothing going on over there. - Yeah... - I don't... I don't think. They're all one of a kind. They're gorgeous. They are. You should pick your favorite one and place a bid on it. You know, every year, our local artists donate these ornaments, and then we raffle them off for charity. That's a tradition started by Jackie's parents back in year one. I see you've met my beautiful wife. Hi, I'm Jackie. And I'm the lucky husband, Frank Haven. I'm Shane Roarke. OK. Shane Roarke. I'd say, black coffee with half a creamer. Impressed? Well, young man, you've seen nothing yet. Oh, the Mountain View has been our life for... -what honey, 22 years? -Twenty-five years. Twenty-five years, says the boss. And believe me, she's always right. Yes, I am. So, Shane, you're not from around here, are you? No, no. Uh, I'm actually originally from New York. - Ah! - And, uh... I've kind of been roving around for the last 10 years. And I just took a job over at the Thunder Mountain resort. Oh, one of our favorite servers works up there. It's the Surface, right? -The Summit. -Yeah, something like that. - Yeah. - Her name's Clara Garrison. Clara. I do know Clara. She's actually... she's actually the manager now. A very good one, at that. Oh, she's terrific! She worked here part-time through high school, and then full-time for a couple of years before she went to Chicago. Jackie and I don't have children of our own, so Clara's sort of like a daughter to us. Right. So, what brings you from the Summit to the Mountain View? Uh... history, I guess. Yeah, I'm kind of... kind of interested in some of the older, more family-run resorts in the area. Well, you've missed the height. I mean, back in the day, there were a good dozen or more just along these mountains. We're one of the few that are still scrapping out a living. It's just so hard to compete with the big resorts and the chains anymore, you know. We still get slammed at breakfast! Yeah, well, thanks to you. Without her Eggs Florentine -we'd be dead and buried by now. -Really? You should come by some morning! Well, I would love that. All right. We're still waiting on one more maple-glazed quail, a seared trout, and we're going to do the final beef carpaccio. -I saw that. -What look? There was no look. I didn't say look. You're still here. Yeah. Um... I'm just getting a start on tomorrow. Nice. Oh, hey, I, um... I just wanted to say thanks for helping out tonight. Oh, yeah, no problem. I mean, it's better together right? No, no, no. I know. I know. But, uh, tonight was crazy busy. On top of being a couple of servers short, so... -thank you. -Oh, yeah. Tell me about it. So, I'm also assuming that you probably didn't have time for dinner tonight? No, but that's OK. I can just grab something on the way home. Oh, please. What do you mean? I'm gonna be making something for myself. You know? I mean, they say I'm not terrible at this. That's true. I mean... They actually have been saying that around here, you know. Who's been saying that? -That's a great idea, actually. -OK. Um, but you cooked all night. How about I make us something? -You? -Yeah. Yeah. -All right. -Yes? I'm not going to say no to that. Uh! Are you sure I can't help with anything? Well, if you grabbed a bottle of wine, I wouldn't complain. - I mean, I can do that. Yeah. - Yeah? That just smells really good. I just-- OK. -I got this. -All right. Wow! That was fantastic. Well, thank you. You know, they say I'm not terrible at this. Mm. I mean, I heard that. Bonnie told me that you, uh, had your own place. - She did, huh? - Mm-hmm. Well... that turned out to be a little girl's dream that got too big. At least you did it, right? I mean, most people just sit around dreaming. Think. Imagine how proud that little girl would have been if she saw what you did? Pretty proud. No, I took on more than I could handle. Maybe it was just bad timing. And, I doubt it. Yeah, maybe. Either way, here I am, back at home, trying to... figure out what's next. Huh! I mean, I think chocolate cake's next. - Chocolate cake? - Mm-hmm. Well, that was my other dream. So, how did you know? You wanted to be a chocolate cake? Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted. Thanks for the company tonight. It was-- It was really great. Well, it was my pleasure. And thank you for cooking. So... Can I walk you to your car? My car... Um, well, it's, uh, it's currently in the shop. And, uh, the last bus left about an hour ago. So, I've been trying to come up with like a clever way to ask for a ride. I will give you a ride. Yeah. Thanks. This is it! Wow. It's a gorgeous building. How long have you lived here? I managed to pick it up with what I had left after Chicago, so... I am impressed, Ms. Clara Garrison. With what? The fact that I'm not homeless? Or... Hey, I live in a hotel and all my belongings are in suitcases, so... So, you are definitely amazing. Wow, I can't believe I'm kissing a celebrity. What's wrong? Nothing, nothing, nothing. I--I just don't-- I don't know if this is the best idea. I just get a lot of attention from the show. I didn't even know you watched it. I don't. I don't watch your show. I was just saying I'm surprised. Like, in a good way. I feel really stupid-- Hang on, hang on. I don't think I'm explaining this right, -but-- -You're definitely not. You-- Good night, Shane. I am such a jerk. Two milks, one sugar. Thank you. You're a lifesaver. -Are you ready for this morning? -Hmm... let me get halfway through this coffee, and I will be. Good. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Uh, I'm just ready. OK. - It's just up here. - Great. - There you go. Enjoy. - Thank you. Jackie! Sorry to bother you. Listen, Frank was right. Those were the best Eggs Florentine I have ever had. Really? Ever. And I happen to be an expert on eggs. Are you, now? Just a little bit. And I'm gonna have to get that recipe from you. I taste the smoked cayenne, but is that mustard powder in there? You must put a little pinch-- Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm afraid that is a trade secret. OK, I'm not gonna ask. More coffee? Actually, I... I should get going to work. Well, could I grab a coffee to go? -Of course. -Actually, can I get two coffees to go, please? - Coming right up. - Thank you. That's Shane's car, isn't it? Uh, I don't know. Hi. - Well, aren't we lucky to find you here! - Janice, Janice. Hi. You know ladies, I... I was actually just on my way out. -Oh, come on. -Yeah. Are you too good for a second breakfast? -So... -What'd you have for breakfast? Uh, I did the Eggs Florentine. - Clara! How good to see you! - Jackie! Aw! I always save a hug for Frank. - Hi! - Hi! Jackie, Frank. This is Hugh Peters. He owns the restaurant I work at. Oh, that's right. The something or other. - The Summit. - Yeah, sounds about right. - Yeah. - It's a pleasure to meet you. Clara, you were right. This place is charming. Guys, could we get a couple minutes after breakfast? We have a proposal we'd like to run by you. A proposal! I haven't had one of those since Frank's. Turned out pretty good. I pay her to say that. Just sit down, and--and we'll be with you right after the rush, OK? - Can wait. Can wait. - OK. Would you like coffee? Yes, please. - This way. - Thank you. Uh, it's so nice to see you guys again. - Really? - Really. Yeah. You're-- Huh, no, no, I... - So, you're a Pisces and we're... - I am. Hmm. What month is Pisces? All right. This will get you started. - Thank you. - OK. June is Gemini. So, if you could eat 10 pounds of food what'd it be? Ten pounds? Uh... probably wings. What is it? Nothing. I figured you might be hungry. -Aw. Thank you. -Thank you. Wow, you were right, Clara. This smells incredible. I told you. Dig in. You know, ladies. I, um, I actually really do have to go. Oh, great idea! -We're moving the party, Janice. -OK. One car or two, Shane? -I, uh... -One, two. We'll figure it out! -Yeah. OK. -Oh! OK. Oh, honey. -So, we'll see you again soon. -I-- I'll be back before you know it. I hope so. If you guys have any questions, please call me. I'd be happy to go over anything to help you decide. I'll look at it, and then Jackie will make the decision. Oh, come on. Not just me! Lovely meeting you both. Hope to hear from you soon. If our Clara's involved, I'm sure it'll work out. Oh, that reminds me. We met somebody else who works at the resort. Oh, yeah. Shawn. -What--What was his last name? -It's not Shawn. It's Shane. Shane Roarke. That sounds about right. Yeah. Oh, so, he was just here for breakfast? No, actually he came by yesterday. Oh! Anyway, thank you both, so much. I'll see you soon. -Have a good time, darling. Bye. -Bye-bye. -Shawn? Shane. Shane. Damn! -No. It was Shane! Everybody! As you know, tonight the restaurant will be closed for our annual charity dinner. It's all in the spirit of Christmas, of course, but if it happens to throw a little publicity our way, so, be it. Don't look now, but someone's throwing you some major eye attention. Let's do some good! ...like when you play basketball, you might play hard. Use some elbow. Ah, yeah. You should go on them easier. Call Clara. -Hey, Mom, you're on speaker. -Hi, Mrs. Garrison. Hello, Bonnie, darling. Clara, I've called to remind you of our family Christmas dinner. Yes, it is on my radar and scheduled in. Will you be bringing someone other than Bonnie this year? Actually, Clive and I are doing Christmas this year. Good for you! Mom, you know I'm too busy to date. So, you're down one Bonnie and stuck with me. Mm. I seem to recall your baby sister making time for Barry -while she was at Harvard. -Mom! I'm just saying. Just saying. Mom, I've got to go. - All right. Just be on time. - I will. - Bye. - Bye. Nice. Got to love it. Mm-hmm. Perfect. Thank you. I managed to sneak you another chocolate raspberry truffle. Oh, you devil. Oh, it's so good. - Thank you. - My pleasure. The food is better than ever this year. Well, we have a new chef. Oh, fantastic! Honestly, though, the best part isn't the food. The best part is seeing you guys again. Aw. -We look forward to seeing you every year. -Oh, it's so nice. Yeah. So, are you seeing anyone? - Clara! - Speaking of seeing... I'll be right back. I would love for you to meet my rock star manager Clara. She is one of a kind. - Clara. - Nice to meet you. -Clara, nice to meet you. -Are you having a great time? I'll just gonna check in the kitchen, and make sure everything is OK. -Absolutely. -Great. I'll be back. And I'm an idiot. Clara? Yeah? Do you mind if I just have a quick word? I saw you at the Mountain View this morning... with those two girls that came in. No, no. OK, I don't know what you think you saw, -but it definitely wasn't-- -Hey, -you don't need to explain yourself to me. -No, no, I was just eating, and they forced me to sit with them. I didn't have a choice. Yeah, you looked really trapped. Argh. I don't--I don't want to fight. I really just came over to talk to you about the other night. Please. Thank you. I... I wanted to talk to you about, um... your car. Uh, has... has the mechanic gotten back to you at all? Yeah. It was a problem with the alternator. -It'll be ready in a few days. -OK, great. Uh, I mean, not--not great. But I was wondering if--if you... needed a... I was gonna offer to take you home -after work tonight-- OK. Right. -I'm good. I guess Mr. Peters can give you a ride home then? -You know, Shane... -Yeah? However I decide to get to work, whether I walk or take the bus, or get a ride with Peters, -is really none of your business. -You know, I know, I know. You're right. You're right-- right, of course. Look. Please. This isn't... this isn't how I saw this going. I just... Can you just let me explain why I got freaked out the other night? That's not necessary because you were pretty clear. No, I wasn't. Look... a celebrity chef isn't something I ever saw myself becoming. And I... I misjudged you rudely, and I just really would like to be able to... explain myself properly. Would you... would you want--want to come back to my place after we're done here tonight? Because you--you cooked for me. Right? And it was--it was amazing. And I would just like to return the favor. I... I mean, eventually I'll have to, it might not be tonight, or... Please? Yeah. Sure. Dinner would be great. - Great. - Great. I wasn't eavesdropping. So, you, uh, you live in a resort? Yeah. Uh, I mean, you know, it's--it's only temporary. It's not home or anything. I do hear they have great room service. Oh, do they? I'm just kidding. Everything looks and smells amazing. Uh, can I help you with anything? Actually I do have a job for you. Two jobs. Number one, is I want you to relax. And number two is to enjoy yourself. So, are you relaxed? - Yes. - Good. And are you enjoying yourself? I am. - Oh! Are you OK? - Uh, OK. And it's really hot. Actually, I'm just... One second. Gonna, um... And... I... Anyway, I'm going to... I'll be back. What a view. It is. I was talking about the mountain. And the snow. And the Christmas lights. I wasn't. Oh, boy. Is that a good "Oh, boy" or a bad "Oh, boy"? It's just the last time we kissed... I've been on exactly... five dates. Three terrible ones, one crazy, and... one more that lasted for eight years. Wow! That is a long date. You know, the show made me kind of look a certain way. But the truth is, I'm not. I'm not that guy. I'm not even close to that guy. Uh, so, when I meet someone now, they usually expect that person that I'm not. You know I'm not that person. Right? I do. That's exactly why I wanted you to come up here. Because I wanted to apologize. For misjudging you. You know, I didn't even like your show. -Oh, come on. -I only saw it twice and... personally, I wanted the other guy to win. Are you kidding? That guy microwaved his steak. Microwaved! -What!? -It's blasphemy! So... what brought you here, anyway? I mean, it couldn't have just been the job offer. No, you're right, it wasn't. When I finished the show, I made myself a promise. Hmm. And being here is part of the promise? Mm-hmm. It is. And how long do you plan on staying? I mean, my contract's for six months. But I am... currently working on something that might keep me here a little bit longer. Mm-hmm. Maybe. -Oh? I still got to do a little bit more research first. Mm. Well, aren't you mysterious? No. I want to know more about you. -Me. -Mm-hmm. Well, I mean, you already know about me. I'm a recovering failure. Failing doesn't mean you're a failure. Unless you give up... I don't think that's you. Mm-mmm. -No? -Mm-mmm. So, who am I? You are strong, determined. You're definitely smart. And you are... exceedingly beautiful. Well, I mean, feel free to go on. You're... -spot on so far. -Am I? Oh, OK, all right. Um... you want a place of your own. You want to build it, and watch it grow. If I had to guess, I'd say that you are... planning on opening your own place again. -Hmm. -Mm-hmm? Well, I mean, I've thought about it. Ah-ha. Whatever it is... you will do it. And it's going to be yours. And it's going to be great. Hey, you don't think it's gonna be a problem with Mr. Peters if you keep coming over here, do you? Mr. Pete-- -Yeah. -Like me and Peters? -You and Hugh, yeah. No, no, we're-- that's-- that's just... -It's business. -Oh, is it? -Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah? Yeah? Are you working on something big? Well, I mean, I promised I wouldn't say anything. Ah, well, aren't you the mysterious one. Just a little. -Thank you. -Here you go. Enjoy. Thank you. You really like him, don't you? I think I do. Yeah. OK. Well, when I first met Clive I thought he was the most boring person in the entire world. You know, I almost didn't go on a second date with him. But then I realized, after a while, he wasn't boring at all. He was just shy. Of course, most city planners are so boring. No. - You don't say. - No, I--I do say. But the fact is, Clive is the-- He just is the funniest, most exciting city planner I have ever met. And I feel really lucky I gave him a chance. I really like Clive. Me too. No, I know Shane isn't a city planner or anything. But I guess famous chefs can be fun, too. Yeah, I guess they can. Well, here's to chefs and city planners. - You know the craziest thing? - Guess what he ordered? -What? -Carrots. Really? I thought he was gonna order some kind of deer. -I don't know... -He would never! -Clara? -Yeah. Can I see you in my office for a minute, please? Oh, yeah, sure. Oh, oh. The principal's office. Somebody's in trouble. Oh, you didn't hear? I am trouble. Yes, you are! Hey. Shut the door if you don't mind and have a seat. I see that you've been spending a lot of time with Shane lately. Yes, my own personal time. Is that a problem? No, no, not per se. I just-- I wonder if you've had enough free time to work on our little proposal. I mean, have you even spoken to the Havens lately? Yes, actually! Um, I see them almost every day at breakfast. Oh. OK. Um... You know, I--I, uh... I got you something. What? What is this? It's just a little Christmas present. Oh, Hugh. I didn't get you anything. Don't be silly. Just--just open it. Wow. This is beautiful. I don't know what to say. Thank you. You deserve it, Clara. I couldn't have done any of this without you. And if this deal goes through, you can buy jewelry yourself that'll make that look like a knock-off. But... if you could encourage them, maybe speed things up. I'd love to get the deal done before the year end. Before New Year’s? Um... Uh, I think they were kind of hoping for a bit of time with this. Ah. All right. This, um, this was supposed to be a surprise, but I was hoping to close the deal sooner because... I have a project that I want to send you to New York for. New York? Like you want me to oversee another acquisition or... Actually, I want to invest in a new restaurant. It would be yours. Ours. But because I'm here doing the Haven deal, if we speed it up, that would open up the New York opportunity for you. Yeah! Wow! It's great. You know what? Leave it to me. They trust me and I think I can help speed them along. -I know you can. -You can count on me. Good. Uh, so? Yeah, uh, the schedule. It's just Bonnie's Thursday, we need to switch it... -Oh, hi, there! -Hi. Here. -Thank you. -You're welcome. So, I've been meaning to ask. Um... what are you doing for Christmas? I don't know. I haven't, uh, I haven't really thought about it. I might--I might go back to the city. Hmm. Hmm-hmm. Well, that makes sense. I'm sure you probably want to see your family. Have you told me about your family yet? You know, I don't think I have. -Do you have brothers or sisters? -No. No, just me. Oh, you're an only child. -Oh, now everything makes complete sense. -What is that supposed to mean? You mean I'm weird? No, I'm just kidding. But I suppose it's all the more reason you should go home and see your parents, right? Yeah. -What? -I want to tell you something. OK. I'm not supposed to say anything, but, um... I'd really like to share this with you. I'm all ears. I can keep a secret. OK. So, you know the project that Peters and I -have been working on? Right? -Hmm. Well, it has to do with the Mountain View. -Really? -Yeah. He wants to buy them out and renovate it and turn it into this beautiful upscale boutique hotel. And, of course, we would keep Jackie and Frank on, but the best part is... is I would be running it for six months. OK. No, this is more than OK. I mean, this is huge for me. I'd be overseeing everything. And then today, he told me that if I could speed this deal along, he wants to send me to New York. Yeah, but Peters got you involved because of your connection to the Havens, is that right? Well, I'd like to think it's because of my experience, but, yeah, the Havens are like family to me. They trust me. Of course. Of course they trust you. But do you trust Peters? Why are you being so negative about this? I thought you'd be happy for me. No, no, no, it's not that I'm not happy for you. I'm happy for you. I'm just... Look, when I first took the job here, I made a couple of calls. And Hugh doesn't exactly have the best reputation. What? So, you can sign a big fat deal with him, and I can't? No, I just work for the guy. All right? It's only temporary. I'm so glad I told you this. Clara, I'm sorry. It's not... it's not what I mean. I'm just saying... that whatever he tells you about this property or anything, you--you can't just assume it to be true, right? You got to take it with a grain of salt. But did you ever think maybe this is all happening because I'm actually good at my job? No, you are! You're most certainly good at your job, but I'm just saying you might still have blinders on because of what happened to you in Chicago. OK, I'm sorry. That's not... that's not what I meant. What I meant to say is he might not be being honest with you. And I just want to look out for you. OK? I told you this because I was really excited. I don't need your approval. I can take care of myself. Clara, listen! Clara! Please! Merry Christmas. Oh, she is just the cutest! Does she have her daddy's eyes or what? Yes, she does. I just want to say how thankful I am to have all of our loved ones together for Christmas. Yes, baby. This was always your father's favorite time of year, and not just because of the slopes! But nothing made him happier than having us all together. Maybe next year we'll have a full house. Right, Clara? I'm kidding. To family. To family! Cheers! Darlene, would you lead us in prayer? -I'd love to. -OK. Dear Lord, thank you for bringing us together during this special time. For blessing us with all this delicious food to nourish our bodies. In the Lord's name, - Amen. - Amen! Thank you, darling. All right, let's dig in. Barry, would you do us the honors? - Yes, I would. - Thank you. So, Darlene, any exciting new cases? I just started a new case. It's been very busy. Yes. So, I can't say too much about it right now, but, yeah. And where are my pictures of the baby? We--We have one for you. Don't you worry. Yeah. We got lots of photos. So, yeah. - It's good. - I'm so proud of you. Oh, I really outdid myself this year. You did! Lydia, I've been meaning to ask. How did your photo shoot go -for your gingerbread house? -Ah, it was for Seasons Magazine. It went amazing, you know. Personally, I think I should be on the cover! Or at least like a two-page spread. - Yeah. - Centerfold. - Yeah. - You know what, I'm just gonna... I'm just going to clear this out of the way for everyone. - Thank you, Clara. - Thanks. -Yeah. Excuse me, Barry. -Mm-hmm. So, um, how are things at work? - Oh, it's going really well. - Really well? Good. Yeah. Well, hello, Clara! Merry Christmas Eve. Clive says hi. -Clive! Say hi! -Hi. Hi, Clive. OK, so, how was the meal? How's the family? You know. My favorite couple doing so well. It's, uh... amazing, and it's absolutely killing me. Do you want to meet for a drink? Uh, yeah, of course. Well, let me just check with Clive. Is it OK if I meet Clara for a drink? -Yup. -Clive says yup. OK, great. I'll meet you-- I'll meet you there. OK. Bye. Thanks, babe. See you later. -Hey, honey. Everything OK? -Hey. Yeah. Everything's fine. Mom, do you think, um... It'd be OK for you to go have a drink with Bonnie? - Yeah. - Sure. Thank you. You know, honey, things can change from one Christmas to the next. I'm just saying. Thank you, Mom. You're welcome. Now, go have fun. OK. I'll see you after. - Hi. - Hey. How are you doing? Thanks for the drink! No problem. Thank you for coming. I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Hey, Mike! - Yeah? - How about a couple of drinks? - Sure, no problem. Christmas... can be a difficult time. Yeah. Here you go. - Thanks, Mike. - You're welcome. To best friends and better days. Cheers. It's just like everyone was so... happy. My sister with her perfect husband, and he's just equally happy with her. And they're both incredibly happy with their child. I mean, it was just... I'm telling you, Bonnie, it was horrible! I'm really sorry to hear about all that happiness. -That sucks. -Right? Well, I'm afraid I have some happy news? What? I'm engaged! Oh, Bonnie! -Congratulations. -Thank you! -Oh, you're crying? -No. Of course not. I'm not. I'm not. -You are. -No, I'm-- They're happy tears. -They're, uh... -They don't look happy. They're happy. I'm happy. I'm so happy for you! When are you gonna do it? I don't know. Maybe in the spring. Or... a few years from now. It depends on how long it takes me to make my own dress. I don't even know how to sew. My best friend is getting married. To a terrific Clive. And I've fallen for a guy who may not be that guy. Or he may be that guy and I just wrecked everything, and I may never even see that guy again. Except at work. At the restaurant. And just five days a week. More with overtime. Yeah. I'm-- I'm going to quit my job. Well, that's a great idea. Hey, Hugh. How's... how's your Christmas? No, the ex-wife dropped off the kids, unannounced, and I'm just trying to get some work done. Oh, that... sounds... fun! Uh, look. I need you to go to the office and pick up something for me, please. Uh, yeah, sure. No problem. I am totally capable of doing that right now. Good. There are documents in a manila envelope on my desk. I'd get them myself, but I'm stuck here. Oh, yeah. Sure. No problem. I'll... I'll pick them up and swing by first thing in the morning. -See you then. -Yes, you will! No, no, no. No more cookies. No, that’s enough. I gotta go. I got to parent here. No, seriously. That's five. We're done. What was that about? It's a secret! I get told secrets now. No big deal. Well, you can tell me, too! Peters just left some paperwork at the restaurant that I have to go pick up. Well, I am in! Well... This is my fourth glass, so, I can't drive. Ah! I'll get Clive to drive! Clive, this is where I work. - All right. Come on in. - Whoa! Hugh's office. Really nice. I like it. OK, what are we looking for again? A yellow envelope. Like this. Honey, I... I think that might be locked. No, it's just stuck. B-Bonnie, I... - See! - Bonnie, I... I got it. Me too! I probably think it's this one that was on his desk exactly where he told me it was gonna be. Well, this is yellow as well, so, I think it deserves a look. This is a... Oh, this is Shane's contract. That's a lot of zeros. This one's just a lot of parking lots. What? - Pretty boring! - Oh... Oh, no, no. This is, uh... this is just our, uh... What? You've got to be kidding me. What? Is it about me? Clive, you're a city planner, right? Correct. Why? Because we need to go to your office. -Yay! Oh, my gosh. -No, no, no. -Yes! -We don't do that. -Oh, we're going! -Or-- You know what? - Aw. - Here. Ah, you know, we forgot to share the mistletoe. That's because we don't need any mistletoe. Hmm. We don't. Shoot. Who's it? Hey! Look who came in - from the cold. Come here! - Merry Christmas, Shane! Merry Christmas. Aw! Oh! -I'm not intruding at all, am I? -No, of course not. Absolutely not! You know we love guests at Christmas. OK. Oh! You look like you could use something to eat. How about I make you a nice sandwich, or Frank can make you a drink? I'd love a sandwich. OK, you got it. -Thanks, honey. -Thanks, Jackie. Come on. Take your jacket off. Make yourself at home. -Thanks so much. -You're welcome. - Bonnie! - This is great. This is so exciting! I don't know why I'm doing this. -This is insane. -Come on. Please, Clive. You're doing it because it's an exciting secret mission. And because you love me. Get in. Get in. Quietly. -But we love him. -Yeah. When I first came here, I didn't--I didn't tell you guys what I was looking for. And I didn't... didn't show you this. Aw. That's my parents on their honeymoon. Yeah, that picture hung up in our kitchen for as long as I can remember. They never really said where they took it, and I didn't really ask because I was a kid. But they said it was somewhere in the American mountainside, and that one day they'd... they'd visit again. But--But they--they never did. And you think they stayed here? I don't know. I don't know. I kind of... You know, I've been ruling out some of the other places in the area, but most of them have been torn down or long closed. Yeah. I'm so sorry. I don't recognize them at all. Of course, this doesn't mean anything because when this photo was taken my parents would've been running the place, and I would've just been a little kid. -But, honey, I do recognize that cushion. -Hmm. Yeah, yeah. That's--That's the one right over there. Yeah, but the trouble is these cushions are all over the place, you know. Right. I--I don't know if it helps, but on the back -is a... a date stamped there. -Hmm. -Oh, in the 80's. -Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. You see, we had a fire here in '92, and it destroyed almost all the records. Otherwise, we could've looked up their names in the log book. Right. Yeah, I was... I was just hoping to find that ornament, but... if it were here, you guys probably... probably auctioned it off anyways. Yeah. Whoa! -What? -Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait. Here, check this out. Here, take this. Take this. OK. Oh, there's no way. I thought you guys would've... I thought... I thought you guys would've sold these. Well... yes, we would've, but not that one. That one is special. That one my mother made the year they built this place. And every Christmas Eve we have our guests put it on the tree. So, if your parents stayed here over Christmas... they would've been asked to do the honors. It's our way of making our guests feel like they're family at Christmas time. So, they were here. They were here. So, Shane... would you like to do the honors? You know, I... I'd actually like to share this with someone. If that's OK. Thank you for this. Did you find it yet? I literally just started looking! It's, uh... Peters. Hugh Peters. - Hugh. - Oh. OK, here it is. It looks like he's made some exploratory proposals. What? What is it? It's just a bunch of condos, or parking lots, and... Wait, this is not what we talked about. - I don't understand what this is. - Let me take these and make a copy. You can read them in the morning, Clara. And then you are gonna destroy them. And then we'll pretend that this never happened. OK? OK. - All right. - Thank you. I love you guys! Bonnie and Clive! - We're criminals! - Oh, heaven help me. Oh, Merry Christmas, sunshine. Merry Christmas, Mom. Thank you. Oh. Someone had a little bit too much fun last night. Mm-hmm. Where'd you find these? They were scattered in the foyer. I-- I can't believe he did this. How about a bagel and lox? A Bloody Mary? Mom, I'm so sorry. I promise I'll be back, OK? I just have to do something. No breakfast? Yeah, I'm coming! Clara. -Did you get the folder? -Oh, you mean Shane's contract? Yes. Thanks. I have to get these off this morning. And there's this! You don't want to renovate the Mountain View. You don't want to "restore it to its former glory". You want to tear it down for condos, and concessions and parking lots! These are just exploratory proposals. Where did you get these? You used me to get to Frank and Jackie. And you couldn't even get that done. They called me this morning to tell me that the deal is dead. Yeah, it turns out your boyfriend Shane convinced them to shut it down. I never should've trusted that guy. He's not my boyfriend. And Shane's in New York. Is that--Is that what he said? Yeah, it looks like Santa's flying past both of our houses this Christmas. Yeah, well, you can take your stupid necklace back, too. I hope you realize you're fired! Oh, I quit! Come on! What? Merry Christmas. Can I give you a ride? Come on. It's a long train. How did you even find me? I went to your mother's house. Well, she told me that you were at Bonnie and Clive's. And so I went there and, um... I mean, they told me about your little crime spree last night. And then I kind of figured out where you might be headed. Look, I know it sounds crazy, but I went to the office, there were two envelopes and-- I didn't come here for the job. I came here because I was looking for something, that promise that I made to myself. And that's why I went to the Mountain View. And that's why I was there last night. These are my parents. Their honeymoon was the one and only vacation that they ever took. You know, they lived in New York City, and they could... they could barely make ends meet, so... it was really difficult for them. My father was a cook at a greasy spoon. My mother was a server. And as a kid I saw... I saw how hard they struggled in their careers, you know. But I guess that's... that's where I developed my love for cooking. When I started to get successful I promised them that I'd slow down and find myself a beautiful little spot like the one that started them off so right. But I--I didn't. Three years ago, my mother died of cancer. Another year later, my father suffered a massive heart attack. So, here I am... three years too late, trying to make good on a promise to a family that I didn't even deserve. You know any family would be lucky to have you. That's really sweet. Now, come on. I want to show you something. Come on in. Merry Christmas! -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. Dinner will be served in the main dining room in a few minutes. I would actually like to give you your Christmas present. It's just like the picture. Mm-hmm. Well, would you do the honors? Please? Gotcha! That's the most thoughtful gift anyone could ever give me. Oh, that's not your gift. -What? -No, no. This is your gift. It took me a long time to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. But when the picture brought me to you... I knew that this... this was the right choice. Jackie and Frank have agreed to sell their hotel. But only to you. Shane, I can't afford that. I want to invest... solely in your business, Clara... because you deserve it. You can fix this place up any way you want. Jackie and Frank have agreed to stick around and work for you. I mean, I'd like to hand in my resume for the head chef, of course, and do all the cooking... minus the Eggs Florentine. But you don't have to hire me. You don't have to do anything you don't want... because it's all yours. Can it be ours? I love you. I love you. You should know... I just got you a scarf. That's just what I wanted. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. A nine-year-old metro girl - got a new lease on life... - Hey, Bonnie. So, my friend Mario is a liftie over at the gondola. And he says he could sneak us up the mountain for a late night ski. You want to go? You mean another exciting mission? Yes! See! I knew you weren't boring. All right! Let's go do this. -Now? Oh, OK! -Right now! Right now! This is your Grandma's favorite. She loves it. She loves her Auntie Clara. That's a pretty dress! Shane! There you are. I've been meaning to talk to you. I've been watching your show. Uh, Ms. Garrison, I'm gonna have to explain. Uh, you see on the show, we have these personas. Yeah, he's not actually that bad. Yeah. I'm really not. Uh, Clara, I know that he's playing a character. And your brilliant, OK. That's exactly why I want to pick your brain. See, I've been thinking about branding myself in the gourmet gingerbread market. Mm-hmm. - Oh! Uh... - Yeah! Uh, yeah, listen, I have like three or four contacts in that market. Really? I was featured in Seasons Magazine. Oh, is that right? -She tells everyone! -I should've been on the cover. But, you know, it was like a two-page spread. It was great! I will be right back, I've got a copy. Matter of fact, I'm going to autograph it for you. - I'll cheers to that! - All right. Cheers! Cheers! Happy New Year!
