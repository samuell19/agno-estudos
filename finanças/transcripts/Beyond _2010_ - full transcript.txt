Leena speaking. This is the Ystad County Hospital, your mother asked me to call. She tried herself, but the call was disconnected. - Why are you calling? - Your mother is seriously ill.

About time we had something to eat, right? l won't be in tomorrow. Leena's mum has risen from dead, so we're on our way to Ystad. Don't forget the trim in the bedroom. Take care! - Well, it's true... - What's the big deal? People lose touch with their parents every day. - Mum, can we have candy? - No, put it back. - Come on... - l said, put it back. Give me the car keys. Parquet floors... Hot water on tap... lndoor toilet... Glass door... Contract... Vow of sobriety... Kicking your kids out of the nest already? We gonna buy sheeds...

Don't flush newsprint or anything else that might clog the drains. Good day. Good day... Thank you. Did you hear that? About flushing newsprint down the toilet? Like we were ignorant pigs, or something! And you just stood there, grovelling! Christ! - Sakari, stop it. - Aili... Calm down. l am calm... You just stood there, so bloody grateful and all... Let's put the kids to bed. ln the middle of the day? Our new flat is really nice and there's so much space. Everyone's really happy... Mum most of all. Hi... Pretty... Sten bought it...

"B". - Bollibompa... - Okay, Flisan, "C". - l pass "C" on to Daddy. So l get to do "C"? Citron and Citronita, are Smurfadelic favourites... That's all l remember. Good job!

Let me close it for you. - The girls are hungry and tired... - Of course they are. - My wedding rings, l left them behind. - Where are they? l don't know. On the side board, maybe. .. - lf it's not too much trouble? - No, don't worry. - Bye. - That's very kind of you. Bye. Leena... There's something l'd like to say to you. Come me some closer... Could you bring Daddy? Please, bring Daddy to me. - Which one's mine? - That one. "Keijo Liimatainen". That's its name. Keijo is going to be the biggest sunflower in Sweden. Good night.

Now all that's left is the mirrors. - The mirrors... - Right. - Mum, is that my money? - No, that's for the cleaners. Your money's in the kitchen. - We're done... - lt looks great. - You were ever so good! - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Thank you. Bloody cow! Acting like we might steal from her...

Or like a light bulb right before it goes poof. ln my dreams, the buildings are all on fire. - How long was it last time? - 30... - Guess what? - l don't know... 42. - Tell me about Esther Williams. - You've heard that a hundred times. Please? - ln America. .. What? - Start at the beginning. Where was l? - l want to get in! - No, you always pee in the water! We lived in a tiny flat, one room and a kitchenette. Like we did, before we came here. Then the Esther Williams Swim School opened. - And you were one of the stars? - Oh, yes... No... Then came the war... We kids had to work. l was a maid. They paid us in food, there was a shortage of everything. l never swam again, l didn't have the time. l had to work, work, work... Supper's ready! lt smelled bad in there... Bloody awful to end up helpless like that. - Make a right turn. - Here? Hey, Aili! Give me a god-damn hand with this! Come and see what l got. Wake up, you cow! Daddy... For fuck's sake... BlTCH! Are you asleep in there, or what? They can hear you shouting all over town! What's the good of a sofa if we get evicted?! Go on... What do we do with a sofa if we get... Bloody hell!! l'll hold you... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... ...eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen... One, two, three... l brought you a sofa, and all l get is grief! - Go ahead, hit me! - 1 0, 1 1 , 1 2, 1 3... Look at all this stuff! She sure has a lot of stuff... Did you use to live here? Check it out, Flisan, more stuff than you! - Want me to take that out? - No, l'll do it later. - What about this? - l'll take care of that later. - Looks like bills. .. - Leave it, l'll take care of it. - Maybe we should take them along. - Go sit with the girls... Johan, please? - There's loads of them... - l'll take care of it. - Daddy, l'm hungry. - We'll get something to eat. Don't put them there! Stop it, l'll be right out... Christ... What's going on here? - l told you not to touch anything! - Hey, she's trying to help you out. - This isn't helping! - Relax, l'll take care of it. l told you not to touch anything! The pictures go here... - ls this you, Mummy? - No.. . Yes. You look like Marja. - Who are these people? - My parents. - What a funny moustache. - She looks so different here... Who's this? - My little brother. - You have a little brother? How old is he? - Does he live here? - No. - Are we going to meet him? - No, he's dead. Where does this go? - l need to pee. - l'll take her... There, now you can go. - May l help? - Sure.. . You have to press down pretty hard. And in there... - May l have a hug? - Nope. Please? Pretty please? - l'm staying with Åse tonight. - l want to sleep at Åse's house, too! - That was delicious. - lt was lovely. - What about your dishes? - Sten! The girls need to learn about neatness and order. Do you know how to wash glasses? No... That's all wrong. Cold water leaves spots. See for yourself... lt doesn't look nice, does it? What are you laughing at? l'll show you how it's done. Grab hold, they're not fragile little ladies. - Now rinse... - Leave the girls alone, Sten. - Are they screwing? - No.. . - Sure sounds like it. - He's beating her. "Aggressive: Violent and angry." "Antabus: Drinking alcohol makes you sick." Johan... "Alcoholic: A person with a drinking problem." "License plate: A car's 'name'." This is brilliant... - "Withdrawal"... - Let's get out of here. "Not getting what you're addicted to." "Orgasm: Sexual pleasure with a climax." "Puck: the 'ball' in ice hockey." "Balls: A part of a man's genitals." That's fantastic. - Where did you get all this? - l overheard things... l miss you. - Do you trust me? - Of course l do. l don't know... lt's like we... l don't know who you are. Let's just stay here tonight, okay? l'm too tired to go anywhere now. l can't do it... Well, maybe if l slept out on the balcony... "Wish list: A new bathing suit." "Happy, sober, parents. A nice Christmas." "Gloves, a scarf, a necklace, beads," "patent leather boots, white." "Fancy erasers for my collection." What happened to your brother? Did he commit suicide? Talk to me! Did he kill himself? Leena, what happened? Come on! A pack of Marlboro lights, please. Help me up... Up... Lower.. . - Lower? - Up.. . - l'm not quite sure what happened. - Just press that... - Where is he? - Johan? He's with the girls. Dad, where's Dad? Dad's right there. Can l have a look? l've been so worried.. . Come and sit down. l've never had it better than in this place... l just ring a bell, and l get whatever l want. That's good... lt's just that l'm dying for a smoke. Do you have a cigarette? No, you don't smoke. - Sometimes it's all l think about. - What? Getting to take a few puffs... Really? - l've got to go. - No, stay... Was my ring on the sideboard? Oh, l forgot to look... l cleaned up. And you have bills from collection agencies. .. For the first time in my life, it makes no difference if l pay or not! Not so fast, sweetie... Could you tell Dad to let Terrie out? A kiss? Sakari, a kiss? Good... Try to make them even in thickness, but a bit smaller, all right? He's drunk. Leena, sweetheart... Bring in the fudge, all right? Let's all sit down together. Why don't you do that later? l told you to take it easy... Sit here, Mum. Look, children... A brilliant Christmas. Christmas tree... - Finish that later. .. - Get off my back! Fucking cunt! Come sit with me. - God damn it! - You stubborn bastard! God damn it! Let the fucker be...
