I'm from Rockville, Maryland, upper middle class family and theatre geek. We have nothing in common. There's absolutely no reason why this should work. Again, you can be as cocky as you want to be. Broadway is such a foreign thing to me, Stairway to your right, please. This is crazy. Tonight Billie Joe Armstrong will be making his professional theatre debut, and his Broadway debut at one time. Fucktime! The role of Saint Jimmy, usually played by Tony Vincent, will be played by Billie Joe Armstrong. I can't act, I can't dance. Compared to a lot of these people, I can't even sing. Come on! I was thinking to myself, "What the fuck are you doing here?" ♪ Don't wanna be an American idiot ♪ ♪ Don't want a nation under the new media ♪ American Idiot, the album, exploded on the scene in those really hideous post 9/11 years. ♪ The subliminal mindfuck America ♪ It was a fierce stance about the state of America. ♪ Everything isn't meant to be okay ♪ As a band we really wanted to make some kind of concept record. Drawing from like Tommy to Sergeant Pepper. England!

And then you go to, um, at the end, at the last verse, - it says 20 years. - Right.

Is that when it was? Yeah, well he passed away in September, and it's like the whole thing is kind of like that, it's like the worst month of the year, you know. I mean for some weird reason, some strange like coincidence, I mean whether it's like my parent dying or... To me it was all-it was a 9/11 kind of thing. That's what resonated for me. Here's the deal... When we started really kicking around this idea, we did not know if Green Day would give us permission to do the production. My heart was in my throat a little bit because I thought, "what if this doesn't work for them?" When people think of Broadway, they think of everyone's singing and dancing and life is swell, and you know, the Rockettes or something like that. What we're gonna try and do today is map out the harder stuff. My fear was that it was just gonna be sort of absurd, and not relatable and corny. ♪ I'm the son of rage and love ♪ ♪ The Jesus of suburbia ♪ ♪ The Bible of none of the above ♪ ♪ On a steady diet of... ♪ At the start of the show I lead my friends into this catharsis of "there's gotta be something else out there. This can't be all there is- this town that's just sucking us dry." Note to self... get me the fuck out of turd town. Let's start a war shall we? American Idiot... I would say 90 percent is sort of based on my life. I just wanted to get the hell out of my town. I wanted to leave with reckless abandon. I didn't car where I ended up, as long as I saw as much as humanly possible. And it had nothing to do with where I came from.

In terms of the way that we plan to tell our story in American Idiot, the closest thing would be opera. In opera, you're telling your story through the physical actions and character behavior that accompanies the singing. This is the dawning of the rest of our lives. You're in the city now, so it's like this massive exultation that you've finally arrived here. So sing the sh-out of it and then your bodies should just be like wild and mad. ♪ Sieg heil to the president gasman ♪ ♪ Bombs away is your punishment ♪ ♪ Pulverize the Eiffel Towers ♪ ♪ Who criticize your government ♪ We put the stuff together. And you never really knew if Green Day would dig what we're going to do with their material. It was terrifying and incredibly important to get Billie Joe's okay on it. But we didn't see him again for quite a while because they were touring in Europe. ♪ Starry nights, city lights coming down over me ♪ We started Green Day when I was about 15 years old. Coming from Berkeley we were always exposed to different politics where people were really confrontational. So around 2003, because of what was happening in the administration what was going on in the war in Iraq, we started to take more of a personal stance. I remember going on this walk and then thinking, "I'm the son of rage and love, the Jesus of Suburbia". Those two lines right there for me were, "Oh my God, here we go". Those two lines came out and they excited me and scared the living piss out of me at the same time. ♪ Rage and love, the story of my life ♪ ♪ The Jesus of Suburbia is a lie ♪ ♪ And screaming Are we we are ♪ I remember cranking that record as loud as it would go, and really just feeling understood.

I am the king of fuckdom! Billie is writing about the world of suburbia and convenience stores, and those things that you grew up with that you hate so much. I've never seen a cast connect to their characters in such a profound way. These characters are sort of us, extensions of us. I've gone through those periods of time where I've just felt this desperate longing to get out into a bigger world than this.

A theme of mine, is just, you know, sort of just being... you know, lost in chaos. When I came on board, the question was how do we take this iconic album, that primarily is sung by one person, and create characters and stories for a number of different people. So after the... ♪ With every breath that I am worth here on Earth... ♪ I love your falsetto. Me and Barry Gibb. For example the song "Last Night on Earth" is going to be this moment where Johnny and Whatsername are shooting up on drugs in a very romantic way. So, already the image of romantically getting high... was in my head, and I thought, "Well how can we make this... how can we make this a trippy love ballad?" And I was on the train one day and I started thinking about it, and then I just thought... how about a wall of sound, beautiful vocal arrangement, kind of in the style of the Beach Boys, these beautiful falsetto harmonies, just raining down on them. ♪ I text a postcard sent to you ♪ And I remember saying to Michael, I said, "This is kind of crazy and it's going to take a while for them to learn, but I promise you, if it sounds anything like my head, it's going to be worth it". You take turns singing, right? We put the stuff together and today we have to show Green Day. Baritones, you guys can really ease up on the volume there. ♪ I walked for miles 'til I found you ♪ With "Last Night on Earth" they won't know what song it is when we start. It doesn't have any of the signature chords or instrumentation. So when Declan starts singing, ♪ I text a postcard sent to you, did it go through ♪ I think they are going to be like, "Oh my god, that's the song". Hey, Michael? We have to get the go-ahead from Green Day or the show is over. They're one of the biggest rock bands on the planet. They're not gonna sign a piece of paper that says, "Oh yeah, you know, you seem like a good guy and I liked your play. So here, go do whatever you want." They need to make sure it's something they can really get behind. Whoo! This one, um, this is a... you'll know this song when you hear it.

That's so... oh my god that was-that was fucking sick. That was so good. That was incredible, that was so good. I was sitting next to Billie Joe and I was so nervous. And at the end of it he just grabbed my leg and squeezed, and told me how beautiful he thought it was, so... I was happy on two fronts. We're telling our story, and as importantly, the band is happy. Man, I mean that's like... you know I was just-I was floored. As soon as I was able to hear it that way, I was completely into it. I could visualize it. I was like, "Oh, this can work". I didn't wanna, like, do it without- Yeah, play with it and then, you know- I kind of do it like how I did on the record, which has nothing to do with the way you guys are gonna do it whatsoever, but, I mean, that'd be cool. The band not only gave us permission to do the show, they've encouraged us with great enthusiasm, and with a kind of appetite to hear their songs in a really different way. Say!

And to create as much potential for all kinds of action to happen, whether it's the video action or physical action. So I made a very large room, which ultimately became a room of 40 foot walls. The scene shop has layered in all the things that we printed digitally, And now that we're here in the space, what I want to try to do is make it feel like a real place. And I always like to say, like giving it its soul. This one is like Will's room so this is going to get like full of CDs... What I'm starting to do is to put things in the nooks and crannies where the actors will kind of see them as they're living here. Things that the audience will never see, but the actors will kind of discover as they're here and working. Alright so, um, now why don't we move this square... We have a team of designers who are all after the same vision. - They look too clean? - Yeah, just a little clean. The challenge is to create an image of chaos on stage. It's like writing a simple song. You know, "Eleanor Rigby" is a simple song... but it doesn't mean that you can fucking do it. You know. There's... you know, and what Christine Jones does with the set is almost the same thing. It's able to go-take you to all these different places, but what you're looking at is a warehouse full of flyers. We'll do this one for time from the same place. ♪ I walk this empty street ♪ ♪ on the boulevard of broken dreams ♪ ♪ Where the city sleeps ♪ ♪ And I'm the only one and I walk alone ♪ American Idiot is based on my life and old friendships. The story's all about the character, Jesus of Suburbia, wanting to figure things out and step up and-and- you know, stand for something he believes in. It's about learning the hard lessons. ♪ Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me ♪ ♪ 'Til then I walk alone ♪ If you study musicals, they talk to you about "I want" songs. That song at the top of the show where a character expresses their wants for the evening. So in terms of this, I wanted to think about, well, where is that moment? ♪ I want adventure in the great wide somewhere ♪ ♪ I want it more than I can say ♪ "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" is kind of Johnny's "I want" song we get into his character. ♪ I'm walking down the line ♪ ♪ that divides me somewhere in my mind ♪ ♪ On the borderline ♪ ♪ of the edge and where I walk alone ♪ Your face should be out for the "I" but it could be right on it. I, you know, okay cool. I play a character called Whatsername. And um... Whatsername is a woman who Johnny meets when he's in the city. They have an immediate, exciting and sparky energy with each other. Okay, hold. That's good, isn't it? Johnny primarily sings "Boulevard of Broken Dreams", but we found a way to bring Whatsername into that song so we establish the romance at that point. Awesome, thank you. ♪ I walk alone I walk alone ♪ There's this beautiful melodic line that the guitars play in the turn around between chorus and verse. It's the da nun da nun da nun daaa nun which I find so evocative, and I actually took that and I put it in the strings at the beginning of the song, because I wanted to really set up that motif because later on she sings it in the last chorus. ♪ Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me ♪ So we feel their worlds intertwine a little bit. ♪ I walk alone ♪ ♪ Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah, ahh ah ♪ ♪ My shadow's the only one that walks beside me ♪ ♪ My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating ♪ ♪ Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me ♪ ♪ 'Til then I walk alone ♪ Did it feel a hair too fast just now?

Oh, okay, yeah, play all the downstrokes just on that ♪ da da da daa da da da da da da bum ♪ - Do you have Facebook? - Yeah. I've just kind of seen that world for the first time. It's terrifying. It is weird, man. Billie Joe is so famous and he is so careful to protect his family from so many people who want a piece of him... I'm lucky to have a cellphone right now. That he's really carved out a very private life for himself and his family. And you can't have that and be involved in a show. The minute you're in a show, you are part of that extended family, for good or bad. For both, right? - Billie, is that right? - He's right. Bon appetite. I haven't experienced that sort of camaraderie with-you know- with people and making friends like that in a long time. Everyone was on the same level. Like, there was one night, people started picking things up and jamming, and then all of a sudden we started playing. And then Adrienne had the photo booth also. And so there was bonding going on... pretty wild bonding going on in that booth. I think it just grew from there. ♪ She's an extraordinary girl ♪ ♪ in an ordinary world ♪ ♪ And she can't seem to get away ♪ Any audience normally observe only a quarter of the playing space, and there's three quarters from their heads that go up to the top. I wanted to make sure that was part of our playing space and not to kind of rule that area out. Pop back is on the two of that fourth bar. ♪ She's all alone again ♪ ♪ wiping the tears from her eyes ♪ I thought it was going to be easier. I was like, "Oh, I can do this.

Johnny's walking through New York... So we had to figure out how to plot out a real story and make them three dimensional characters. Johnny is the vulnerable one that gets... never had a family. Michael Mayer saw something in what I do that no one has ever really been able to make sense of. Not in the rock world. Whatsername... I always wish Whatsername had a name. And so I just trusted him. I knew what he was doing was-was cool. 5, 6, 7, go, 1... We kept working to make the story clear through the choreography. Soft. Steven had an idea that the chorus in "When September Ends" would do a kind of ballistic searching for slumber almost under the stage floor, and it was thrilling to watch. ♪ 20 years has gone so fast ♪ But when we put it all together it became very clear that it was almost too much. And it was taking away from the simplicity of the story of these three guys. Yeah, I think I wanted to put all the whistles and bells on it, and actually when we watched the whole thing there's literally a moment that described everything. And as long as we held on to that moment, right in front of us, the nugget of the sequence, everything else was able to fall away. We've ended up with a version that's got more stillness than anything else, which is the last thing I thought it would have. But working on it over the-over the weeks and then looking at the whole show... it's one of the pieces that I'm most excited about. ♪ She puts her makeup on ♪ ♪ like graffiti on the walls of the heartland ♪ ♪ She's got a little book of conspiracies right in her hand ♪ ♪ She is paranoid ♪ ♪ Endangered species heading into extinction ♪ ♪ She is one of a kind ♪ ♪ Well she's the last of the American girls ♪ ♪ She's a rebel ♪ When you're doing a new show, it's really important that you try it out somewhere before you bring it to New York. Who do you have coming tonight? I got my mom, and my sister... What you wanna do is give yourself an opportunity to put a show on its feet with full production values and learn what you can. Put your damn top on! You want to make sure it's the cast that you want. You wanna work the kinks out. Oh shit my nails aren't dry! And you wanna try it out in front of an audience. I usually am angry when the audience comes for the first time. I'm like, you know, I've been having a great time here in rehearsal, and now you're going to come with all your opinions... so I'm like, "fuck, the audience is coming." Sound bright! 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... But I don't feel that way at all. I just can't wait to, like, just to get them there and like, see what happens. You know what? I have no idea what's going to happen or what it's going to be like. And so that's incredibly- that's incredibly thrilling. So just like, bring it. Come on, fuckers. What? ♪ Don't wanna be an American idiot ♪ Go. Lights 10, go. Lights 11, go. By opening night at the Berkeley Repertory Theater, the story that we had was 3 guys in a shitty little suburb decide that they're going to get out.

Michael really stuck to the heart of the album and then he created new characters. I find all of those characters very relatable. Those people remind me of my friends and they remind me of myself. At the end of the show Johnny has gotten off drugs and comes home clean and sober. ♪ Home, we're coming home again ♪ Tunny has come back without a leg but with a loving girlfriend.

This is a portrait of America today. They knocked it out of the park as they say. It was amazing. We've had a month and a half of rehearsals for this, so we were really ready for tonight. Um, but having a crowd that was on board with us like that is a phenomenal feeling. It's always a little bit like, "Ohhh" you know, "please, please like it" and part of me is like, "you know what, we're making a piece of art. We're putting it out there to the world, If we love it, if we believe in it, that's what matters." I'm hoping the future is Broadway, which is something I've never touched. I've never been on Broadway before, so this would be huge. I felt sort of validated as a song writer, my melodies felt validated. You know, people don't really talk about these things like that in the rock world so much, that, you know, it's either a good song or it's a bad song, or it's-you know, does it rock? Is there a riff? Where's the hook? Where's the blah blah blah blah? Here we go. When Tom Kitt put his spin on it we were able to sort of create sort of a dialogue I think I've been waiting to have my entire life. So after we yanked Billie Joe into our world, he turns around and invites us... into the world of Green Day. Fuck. The cast was in Berkeley doing the show every single day and playing "21 Guns" every day. We were on tour playing "21 guns" at the same time. So we said, "Well, why don't we just do this thing together? Like-like let's do a recording." The challenge with "21 Guns" is that it has so many different layers to it. So we had to keep track of how they're supposed to fit when we were recording one at a time. ♪ Do you know what's worth fighting for ♪ ♪ When it's not worth dying for ♪ ♪ Does it take your breath away ♪ ♪ And you feel yourself suffocating ♪ ♪ Does the pain weigh out the pride ♪ ♪ And you look for a place to hide ♪ For me recording and producing is... it's psychological. ♪ You're in ruins ♪ Cool.

You know, I think some of these versions are- are better than what we recorded. ♪ She outs her makeup on ♪ ♪ like graffiti on the walls of the heartland ♪ When the Grammys asked Green Day to perform at the show, Billie Joe immediately said, "well, I want to do it with my cast." - Here they are. - Hey. It's the Grammy party. - Grammy party's up in the air. - Grammy party! I thought your hair might be down, and sort of like that. ♪ She is one of a kind ♪ ♪ She's the last of the American girls ♪ It's a little too much fabric, though. Oh, yes! You're a firebird. Oh my god, this is the Grammy outfit! When we opened at Berkeley, there was a lot of interest in bringing the show to New York. And so, we are at the Grammys and we find out that we're definitely going to Broadway. So not only do we get to perform with Green Day, on the Grammy Awards, we get to actually say that we're gonna be on Broadway. - This is nuts. - Yeah, it's crazy. Show 'em your talent, buddy. Show 'em your talent. I don't know if you guys have done award show thing or anything close to it, but it's like... kinda basically playing to cameras more than it is playing to the crowd, 'cause everybody's a fucking zombie. Like they're all-everyone's nominated, like white knuckling it the whole time, you know, like. So that's one thing we figured out a long time ago. In the beginning, three punks created a rock masterpiece called "American Idiot". Their dreams live on, and "American Idiot" has become a stage musical about to hit Broadway in a big way this March.

It's not an opera really, and it's definitely not your parents' Broadway musical. So I don't know how-how it's gonna go down. The thing I was worried about is I wanted to make sure people had open minds. When you're bringing your family to go see something, on Broadway, it's hard to kind of go, "now, do I feel like being challenged right now? Or do I want like, um... a nice little fairy tale?" American Idiot is like... it's a cold reality. - Hi. - Yes, yes yes yes. I skyped with Hoggett this morning. He sends all his love, he's "gutted" not to be here. He's just "gutted". But I described to him basically the adjustments that Lorin and I are making, and he thinks that all sounds great. So gear up. What will be required will be even more than what was required prior. Here we go. ♪ I lost my faith to this ♪ As soon as the Grammys are over, we are starting up right away. Everything about this day is so fucked. What else is fucked? There's an incredible amount of stress. It's Broadway, and so you really are under the microscope. What we found in Berkeley was that we had a lot to do, still, to improve the story. Saint Jimmy! As well as the staging, and the choreography, and the arrangements. Casting is a gigantic part of it. ♪ Beating out of time ♪ Billie and I wanted someone who had a kind of all-American nature, even though the character of Tunny has become very pissed off and aggressive and hostile. Hey Stark! Stark and Johnny! The most important thing for you, is that the subtext is mother-fucking land of make be-motherfucking-lieve. Do you know what I mean? Don't worry about the steps, just plug in to what that energy is. ♪ We are the kids of war and peace ♪ ♪ From Anaheim to the Middle East ♪ ♪ We are the stories and disciples of ♪ ♪ The Jesus of Suburbia ♪ ♪ Land of make believe ♪ ♪ And it don't believe in me ♪ ♪ Land of make believe ♪ ♪ And I don't believe ♪ ♪ I don't care ♪ ♪ I don't care ♪ ♪ I don't care ♪ It's a trip to see your life experiences being interpreted on stage. Let's start a war, shall we! So don't think about when you're here, as you turn around here. There's Tunny, in his naïve way. So that first step is commitment. ♪ Drain the pressure from the swelling ♪ And then there's Will. The guy who wasn't really quite ready to be a grown-up. You know, I've learned that lesson the hard way. ♪ Give me a long kiss goodnight ♪ ♪ And everything will be alright ♪ Can I give you some other things to think about? Yes, absolutely. And Johnny with all of his wanting to stand for something that he believes in. ♪ Saint Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway ♪ And then gets blindsided by himself. ♪ Comin' at you on the count of 1, 2 ♪ 1, 2, 3, 4! And Saint Jimmy's just- he's just a bad motherfucker. ♪ My name is Jimmy and you'd better not wear it out ♪ ♪ Suicide commando that your momma talked about ♪ Saint Jimmy is part of myself. ♪ The needle in the vein of the establishment ♪ You know, everyone's got their demons. Like, we're all creatures of habit. It's hard to shake that stuff off. Yow! Billie Joe, just like all of us, has his dark side... Saint Jimmy! The side that's self destructive, manipulative, charismatic but dangerous to himself and to others. ♪ My name is Saint Jimmy, I'm a son of a gun ♪ ♪ I'm the one that's from the way outside now ♪ There's a parallel between, you know, me going to New York for the show and what happened in American Idiot. ♪ I really hate to say it but I told you so ♪ ♪ So shut your mouth before I shoot you down 'ol boy ♪ But this time, it's almost like a second chance to do it the right way. Everybody! ♪ It's Saint Jimmy ♪ ♪ And that's my name ♪ ♪ Give my regards to Broadway ♪ ♪ Remember me to... Is that right? ♪ Ba ba ba ba ba ♪ ♪ And tell them I'll be there 'ere long ♪ - Right? - I'll be there 'ere long? I think that's what it is. - We gotta look this up. - Yeah, look it up. I love the Saint James theater. It's got such a fantastic feeling when you walk in. There's something grand about it. Give my regards to ol' Broadway and say that I'll be there 'ere long. You have the gorgeous ornate architecture inside, and the décor, and then there's American Idiot. I love that juxtaposition. We were watching TV on tour, and Mike goes, "How do you know this shit?" And I was like, "I learned it when I was a little kid". ♪ Isn't it rich? ♪ ♪ Aren't we a pair? ♪ ♪ Me here at last on the ground ♪ ♪ You in mid-air ♪ ♪ Send in the clowns ♪ When I was a little kid, from the ages of like 4 and a half, until I was about 14, I took, like, vocal lessons. But I never told any of my friends, Like I-because it was-it was just something that I did. And I was just learning music, and you know, maybe it wasn't the most masculine thing, or whatever, in the world. ♪ Why can't they be like we were ♪ ♪ Perfect in every way ♪ ♪ What's the matter with kids today? ♪ My mom would take me around and sing, like, at convalescent hospitals. And I would sing anything from like Frank Sinatra, Al Jolson, George M. Cohen. It would just be like stuff this woman, Mrs. Favarone, she would teach me, and I didn't... I think it just kinds got ingrained in my head. I wonder if that has had some impact, it must have, in the way that you write songs... You take a song like "Wake me Up When September Ends" which is the... you know, one of the penultimate moment of the show, one of the penultimate moments of the album, you know, and this progression... which, you know, is so beautiful, and feels to me like Chorus Line, "What I Did for Love". Yeah. Wow, that's a good one. And then you have this major to minor, which you know. "Love is Here to Stay", too, does that major to minor. So it's-it is, all I mean it's melodic and it's major to minor, it's the-it's the- it comes certainly from this whole tradition. Well I think album making, or the art of it for me, is like, that it takes you on a ride, and the songs speak to each other. Okay that's a stretch. That's bad. I don't know how to explain how Billie Joe and I, who come from such different worlds, manage to have such a fruitful collaboration. To me what's so interesting is it's that Tin Pan Alley stuff. I think it's because both of us, at our hearts, are entertainers. - So it's not just about drugs. - Yeah. 'Cause here, it's such a metaphor, that he became that kind of... In my rock world, things get so competitive, that sometimes it's a- you get into a mode where people become discouraging. This was just a different feeling. It was almost-people were- you know, I don't want to over-romanticize about it, but it was-everybody was sort of encouraging each other, and... you know, it's just-it's New York, it's not like- it's not some bullshit Hollywood crap, you know. The whole theatre thing is really seductive, and it's just inspiring too. ♪ I left my blood like bullets over Broadway ♪ Every day I had this discipline ritual where I would just write about anything. It doesn't matter what it's about. It doesn't have to even make sense. ♪ With broken legs and roses over New York ♪ I would just write something. It would be 30 seconds, it would be 40 seconds, it would be two minutes. I just had this momentum of just, like, writing songs. And I would do that during the day, and then I would end up going to the show at night. ♪ In my own private suicide ♪ I just felt like a sponge. I just kind of sucked everything up. So, what I'm gonna do is look at swapping you guys out. I just want to make sure it doesn't translate as he's the father. Today's our final rehearsal. ♪ Nobody's perfect and I stand accused ♪ We're going to do all of our last little picky notes or try new things for the last time. What would be better is if you were up here-ish. - Ballet thing. - Uh huh. From "Jimmy died today". I don't think it should be busy. No. Will! Okay, hold. So Carmel, we're gonna make a small adjustment. So it'll be "Oh shit, this is my life." Bam bam- as opposed to a question. Oh shit, this is my life. ♪ I'm the son of rage and love ♪ Hold there. Can we have the cast in the house please? Full cast in the house, please. The time has come. The show is now yours, so fly with it. It's in-we're in spectacular shape. I couldn't be prouder of it. It's such a weird feeling because since, you know, since the beginning we've been working and working and shifting things and finding it. Um... but um... we found it and it's fantastic. ♪ I got a rock and roll band ♪ ♪ I got a rock and roll life ♪ ♪ I got a rock and roll girlfriend ♪ ♪ And another ex-wife ♪ ♪ I got a kid in New York ♪ ♪ I got a kid in the Bay ♪ ♪ I haven't drank or smoked nothin' in over 22 days ♪ ♪ So get off of my case ♪ ♪ Off of my case ♪ I'm here to welcome you to the Gypsy robe ceremony for the opening night on Broadway, of American Idiot! Everyone who's making their Broadway debut tonight come here to the center of the stage. The Gypsy robe tradition began in 1950 when a chorus dancer in "Gentlemen Prefer Blonds" sent a dressing robe to the Imperial Theater where "Call me Madam" was opening with a note proclaiming the robe had been worn by all the Ziegfeld beauties and would bless their show. The Gypsy robe is awarded to a member of the chorus who has the most Broadway musical chorus credits. The honored gypsy puts on the robe, circles the stage three times counter-clockwise, and the show is blessed. Yeah!! It will be our pleasure to see the Gypsy robe for American Idiot presented to Andrew Call. Congratulations! I always looked at Broadway as being some sort of impossible dream. It is my goal, it is my dream, and I'm living it right now. It feels so good. These actors, they put so much passion and heart into what they're doing. I heard Liza Minnelli is coming tonight. Oh you punk kids were just terrific! I loved what you were doing-all that stomping around on stage, it was simply inspired. I woke up today thinking, "Okay, it;s just another show, it's just another show." But it's not just another show. It's American Idiot! On Broadway, you know? It was really strange to see Donald Trump. I was like, "what the fuck are you doing here? Really?" In 3, 2, 1... Green Day is used to the stage, but now they're coming to Broadway. I am Ann Craig. Coming up, I'm taking you inside their brand new musical American Idiot. It's showtime. Did you ever think you'd get here? Uh... I've been working for this for 30 years... I hoped I would make it. The application of eye shadow is a very very delicate procedure. We all believe in it so much... But um... I've never felt so lucky in my entire life. You deserve it, man. Thanks. Thanks. Opening night, baby! It's gunmetal grey. I had to. I love boys, they're stupid! I don't know what to expect. It's kind of helpful to be like, "I can handle it". I'm saying this now I'm thinking, "Okay, you're definitely jinxing yourself right now." And now we're at 15 minutes. It's time to unleash this on New York. Let's do it. 1, 2, 3, it's fucktime! ♪ Don't wan an be an American Idiot ♪ ♪ Don't want a nation under the new media ♪ ♪ Hey, can you hear the sound of hysteria ♪ ♪ The subliminal mindfuck America ♪ The reaction was amazing. One hard-core Green Day fan is like, "Oh my god." I go, "It's not what you thought it was gonna be was it?" He was like, "Not at all." And then I heard someone say, "I guess this was inspired by a rock band or something like that." I mean they had no clue what Green Day was, and that was really exciting, because it was reaching a whole new audience. Amazing performances, incredible energy, not like anything else on Broadway. My next guests star in the acclaimed new Broadway musical based on the Green Day album of the same name. From the looks of things tonight, I can tell you this show is going to attract a whole new crowd right here on Broadway. Okay, here's the deal, and this is the honest to god truth, I don't read the reviews. I really don't. American Idiot is getting - phenomenal reviews. - Great reviews. I know that we got some ecstatic notices. Almost the best thing I've seen on Broadway. And some notices that were carping about this or that. But I will say the audience response was over the top. It was crazy. It was wild. Uh... You know, I would just-all that electricity, that excitement, and sort of everything felt like it was on fire. Billie Joe went from being moderately interested, to getting more intrigued... to becoming passionate about what the whole Broadway vibe was. So by the time I suggested to him that my secret dream was that someday he would play Saint Jimmy... he couldn't-I-I saw a little light... behind his eyes, a flicker of excitement. He said, "Oh really? You think so?" I'm like, "Uh-huh." And the next day he called and said, "Oh my god, are you serious about this? I'm shitting." ♪ My name is Saint Jimmy I'm a son of a gun ♪ ♪ I'm the one that's from the way outside now ♪ ♪ A teenage assassin executing some fun ♪ ♪ In the cult of the life of crime now ♪ The first day I rehearsed, Michael goes, "Oh, there's something I forgot to tell you. This is going to be really awkward at first." And it was really awkward. Don't look at the girls until the scream. Okay. Just be focused on him. They don't even penetrate your consciousness. I was really really nervous about whether I could do it at all. Here we go, ready? He didn't want the press to come, he didn't want people to talk about it. It was absolutely hush hush. Do you mind? Just for me to see it again. So we'd sneak him into a theater where we would rehearse. See how cool that looks? She does that all in one. You stop yourself. She's a professional dancer. Are you asleep? I was nervous about acting in general, you know, like, the silent moments, the stillness in parts. I'm not used to doing that at all. It's dead silent and your brain's going brrrrr you know... "stay still, don't say anything." You know, that part was hard. He was freaked out. He didn't know if he'd be any good. Is life imitating me or is rage imitating life? I feel like a civil war, like a knife in the heart! I've got an axe to grind and it's splitting my head open! No friends, no girls!

Saint Jimmy! In the old days, coming from sort of an underground scene, there was a lot of bands that you would watch that were your friends' bands and things like that. You know, everyone would sort of feed off each other, and have fun, but at the same time be, you know, learning. Once Green Day took off, we started losing that. We were losing friends, which is fine, you know, it's like, you only need a few. But it's um... it's uh... it gets, um... it just became difficult to sort of find, um, kindred spirits in that way. ♪ We are the world ♪ Which charity is this for? Mine! When the cast came along I started to feel it again and Ive always wanted that. I've always been, almost-almost naïve about it, where I wanted to make those kinds of relationships... Did we get it? Did we get it? And it didn't happen in rock and roll music. It happened in theatre.

Did I tell ya how many times I've been reprimanded for... - That was the best. - For bad behavior. I know. One night I grabbed a bottle of whiskey and took a sip of it. And then- and then um... and I remember you going-you were like, - "You can't do that." - Right. You know, it was like, "note", and it was like my notes was, "Don't get bottle of whiskey and bring it one stage." Then the naked cowboy happened, and then everything was off to the races. And then another time, I ran out and grabbed a bunch of Twizzlers, and I threw it at the whole crowd, and they were like "yeah!" I was like, "Oh, that was pretty cool." And then... and then all of a sudden, here comes Tom Hulce walking back and he was like- he goes, "Um... you... um... there's this thing going on on the stage and um... it's... you can't run off of it because it's... it's really disruptive to what's happening on stage." And I go, "So, you don't want me to throw Twizzlers at people anymore?"
