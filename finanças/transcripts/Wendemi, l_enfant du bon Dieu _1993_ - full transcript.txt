RESTORED BY THE CINÉMATHÈQUE AFRIQUE, WITH PERMISSION, FOR THE PROJECT "20 FILMS FOR 2020." Leave, and don't come back until you tell me who got you pregnant. Try to understand. She has her reasons. She will tell you one day. How can a woman not know who impregnated her? Except for the Virgin Mary. Brother, the whole family begs your forgiveness. Get the hell out of here if you aren't going to own up to it. Nobody in this town will find out about it or I will kill you myself. You are right, but don't be so hard on her. It isn't as shameful as it once was. It is when she won't say who the father is! I won't forgive her until I know. Show some mercy. Don't air your dirty laundry in public. I'm the family elder. You have always respected me. But I'm surprised by your attitude. For heaven's sake, be reasonable. Brothers, I heard what you have to say, but I have made my decision. Because of this slut, I feel humiliated. Let go. I'll kill her! I won't talk to anyone else except Father George. You should not refuse to forgive your own family. She will tell you eventually. Leave me alone! What is the matter? My daughter, Cécile, is pregnant. She won't say who the father is. See? It is a serious problem. What did you say? Cécile is pregnant? -Did she say anything? -No. She won't tell me who did it. I'd do anything to know who the father is. It brings shame on the whole family! Zaccharie, calm down. There's no need for violence. Father George, would you talk to her? She would tell you everything. What are you asking me to do? You want me to make Cécile talk? And then share whatever she might confide in me? It would break the seal of confession. Zaccharie, it is a crime! Be reasonable! Go easy on her. God urges us to forgive. Father George, this has nothing to do with the seal of confession. She has to tell us. According to tradition, a child without a named father has no family. Whose name will they take? They would be a social outcast. They would be miserable. Fine, I understand, but you must show forgiveness. Have I made myself clear? What are we going to do? We'll think on it. Wait until morning. The night can give counsel. It's time I went home. Good night. Go inside and rest. We'll talk in the morning. Hurry, Pierre. It's about to rain. -I can hear a baby crying. -What? Come on! He's right. I heard crying too. Madeleine, aren't you worried about the storm? Monique, someone has abandoned a baby. What? A baby? Look. How strange. Cécile went missing last night. I'm looking for her. It's one problem after another. Don't worry. Cécile is strong. She will come back. -I hope so. -The rain has started. -What will we do? -We can't leave him here. Let me take him. You're already carrying a baby. What now? Michel's wife found a baby. Give him back! I don't want an abandoned baby in my yard. Here she is. I've brought your baby. -My baby? -Yes, your baby! You were with me when we found him and you took him. Is that right? I see how it is. -Take back your baby. -It's not my baby. Take him back! You and your children found him! Get off my property, stupid bitches. You had better take this baby. He can replace that slut of yours who doesn't know who got her pregnant. Madeleine, how dare you! And I thought you were my friend! I'll say it again. Your daughter is a slut. Stop arguing. Shut up, both of you! You're adults. Is Zaccharie at home? Yes, he is. Hello, neighbor! How are you? I don't want to hear another word about that baby! Get out of here! I'll take him to the authorities. Okay, don't forget your papers. He had this bracelet with him. Take it with you. Hello? What are you doing in here? It's about the baby… Out! I told you to get out! What do you want? We found him this morning and I came to tell you. You and who else? My wife, myself and Zaccharie's wife. Show me your ID card. Your ID card! I don't have one. Corporal Wendaogo, you know who I am, don't you? We drink together at Fatimata's bar. That is no excuse for not having your ID. What do you want us to do? You are the authorities. You should be telling me what to do. This is out of our jurisdiction. Figure it out yourself. Take him to the chief. Thank you. Sir, we should have taken a statement. Don't worry about it. Hello. How are you? My respects to the chief. Welcome. What brings you here? I have a problem I need to raise with the chief. This morning, on our way to work, we found this baby in the bush. I want to take him to the chief. You found a baby! You and who else? My wife, myself and Zaccharie's wife. Take a seat. The chief is still resting. The chief asks you to speak. We found this baby in the bush. I came to show him to the chief. You and who else? Myself, my wife and Zaccharie's wife. Go to the authorities. I just came from there. They told me to come here. Since the revolution, I no longer handle problems like this. Take him to the priests. They work with the authorities. The chief says go to the priests. You may go now. Hello, Father. Hello, Michel. Why weren't you and your wife at mass on Sunday? We were busy working in the fields. Work is important, but you should make an effort to come to mass. Actually, I'm glad you came. I suggest we baptize your baby two weeks on Sunday. That is the day mass will be celebrated by the Bishop of Ouagadougou. The entire congregation will come together in worship. It's an honor for your child to be baptized on such a day. Father, this is not my child. We found him this morning on our way to the fields. In the name of God! An abandoned child! Where did he come from? Nobody knows. I went to the authorities. They sent me to the chief, who told me to bring him to you. To me? Why me? We don't have an orphanage here. You know that. What should I do? Michel, this child should stay with you. Take care of him. He is a gift from God. If you are ever in need, I will always be there to help. Don't forget about mass. How did it go? The authorities sent me to the chief. The chief sent me to the priests. Nobody would take him. Father George advised me to keep him. He promised to help us. We should give him a name. How can we name him without knowing who his parents are? Only God knows who his parents are. Fine, we'll call him Wendemi. Wendemi, why do you have to break everything? Hey, you there, who is your father? -Me? -Yes, you. I am Michel's son. Liar! Who is my father then? I don't know. You will never know. If you know, tell me. I won't. I don't know. As the proverb says, "He who knows, "does not speak. "He who speaks, does not know." Dad wants to see you. Don't do that! Give me some. Mom doesn't want you to eat. Come with me. I know where you can find food. Dad says you have to get back to the house. Wait here. I'll be right back. Hail Mary, full of grace. What is the matter? Our agreement… I forbid you to bring anyone here. It isn't just anyone. He's an orphan. Thank you. What are you doing? I'm hungry. You're hungry? I don't want to see you here ever again! I suggest you leave this town. Disappear! I already told you not to go down to the backwater. What's wrong with this kid? I don't want you anywhere near that shepherd. He's always up to no good. Get out of here! Did you say I was with the shepherd? I saw you at the priest's house. You snitch! Orphan! You aren't my real brother. Mom told me. Stop it! What is wrong with you? Devil child! You'll kill my boy! I'm leaving town. Maybe we'll meet again some day. Don't throw it away. Give it to me. No way! Help! Did you push him? I tried to stop him from throwing the food. He slipped. You will explain yourself at home. What happened? It almost ended in disaster. I saw your two sons fighting. The other one pushed him in the water. He was lucky. I saved him, but the other one ran away. I told you! That evil child wants to kill my son. Enough. Don't exaggerate. He's a stubborn kid. Let's go find him. There he is! Stop! Up to no good again! I told you not to come down here! Without his help, you'd have killed your brother. You should forgive him. What's going on? He almost drowned his brother. Michel, forgive him. He is only a child. Try to be careful. -Thank you. -You are welcome. Time to go home! I don't want anything to do with him. -He almost killed my son. -Be quiet. You brought him here in the first place. Hello. Hello. Is there a problem? We have received reports of child abuse. It appears to concern a child in your care. My name is Émile Bonkoungou. I am responsible for the care of children, orphans, abandoned children, and delinquents. We will take him. You and your wife must come to the police station tomorrow morning. No, I don't want to go! If you had treated him properly, this would never have happened. Why would they take the boy away? I'm sure they'll tell us. Let's hear what they have to say. Go ahead, you're next. -Hello. -Hello. Take a seat. What is it? We've come about our child who was removed from our care. He is not your child. Show me your family record book. -What is his name? -Wendemi. I don't see that name in here. We took him in when he was a baby. He has been well educated until now. You call that an education? Fighting all over town? Corporal Wendaogo, please explain it to this stranger. He doesn't understand that here, education involves a beating. I'm a stranger? Just because I'm from Bobo? Stop! That's enough. Go to see Émile Bonkoungou, he can authorize the adoption. -Thank you. -Goodbye. Did you hear that Bobo guy try to say he wasn't a stranger? Bobo is over 100 miles away! He's mad. Someone is here to see you. Show them in. You can go in. He'll see you now. Hello. Please, sit. You took in a child. You did not announce it to anyone. Nor is he well educated. You mistreat him. Where are his parents? We found the child and nobody wanted him, so he stayed with us. Who didn't want him? We took him to the police, to the chief, and to the priests. Nobody would take him. Did you bring him here? We didn't know what to do. You weren't around. You are in luck. Have you heard about the five-year growth plan? The crops are done growing, we're harvesting now! That's not what I mean. A five-year growth plan is a governmental program to develop the country. The first point in the plan is to build the presidential residence, the second, hospitals, and the third, roads. For the fourth point, I promise to build orphanages across the country. Do you think we're sleeping on the job here? Quite the opposite. As for the boy, I'm informing you that we have taken him to entrust him to the chief. You are forbidden from seeing him. Why? If he has any belongings, take them to the chief. You may leave. Hey, lady, get out of here! -Why? -Women may not enter. Forgive me. What is wrong? The authorities took the child to put in the chief's care. I came to see him and deliver his things. The chief asks you to hand it over. The boy stays here. I'll come back to see you. The brothers offer two chickens. I offer my thanks. Chief, your apprentice is hurt. Choose someone to accompany me on my return journey. The boy will stay here until I say otherwise. Pogbi… Bring me some water and the medicine flask. You must beg the chief to let me go home. I have been with him for so long, and as night falls, I won't be able to find my way. My parents must be worried about me. I'm fed up of hiding. Everybody knows now anyway. Ask my father for my hand in marriage or we stop seeing each other like this. Wait a few more days. It will all work itself out. Greetings, patriarch. Welcome. Take a seat. As I get older, I have trouble recognizing faces… I am Wendemi. The child left here by the chief. You! You have grown so quickly. Time flies. -How is your family? -They are well. What can I do for you? I need your help with something. What might that be? I want to ask my guardian for his daughter's hand in marriage. Oh, to be young! Why do you need my help? It sounds like good news to me. Listen. Offer a chicken to the chief of this land so that he'll give you a plot to cultivate. You cannot marry your guardian's daughter and live in his home. Once you have your land, come back to see me. I, along with some of the elders, will ask for the girl's hand on your behalf. Greetings. -Do you know this boy? -No. He was abandoned by the chief and taken in by Noaga. He is now a child of this land. What brings you here? I have come to ask for a plot of land to cultivate. The revolution took everything we had. We can only make talismans. Go to the authorities. They take care of that. We lost everything. I understand. Thank you. I'll be going now. Good luck. Greetings. Sit down. Welcome. Your timing is perfect. We were just talking about you. Have your efforts proved fruitful? Yes. The authorities manage the land now. They asked me to go back next week. Forgive me. I had forgotten that the authorities controlled the land. Next week, you say? Yes. We elders may have lost our sight, but we see things you young people can't. I cannot make the journey. I have chosen Raogo and Bouga to accompany you. Good luck. Good evening. Welcome. -Pogbi. -Yes, Mother? Bring water. I wasn't expecting your visit. Patriarch Zitinmi sent us here. Wendemi, whom you have brought up so well, has now become a man. He wishes to stay in the village and raise a family. It is an honor for us all. Would it be by Pogbi's side? In this town, nobody knows Wendemi's story better than us. I respect Patriarch Zitinmi, but it's a complicated situation. Before I say yes or no, I want to know who Wendemi's parents are and most importantly, his family name. Since the chief left him with us, we have not heard anything from him. I have asked Wendemi. He never wanted to talk about his parents. The boy wouldn't tell me anything. We shall return and inform the patriarch. It is never too late to do things right. Let's stay hopeful. Return safely and send my regards to the patriarch. Goodbye. Sit down. Isn't nature beautiful? We haven't had such a wonderful season in a very long time. If being happy meant eating till your heart is content, we'd be more than satisfied. Wendemi, why did you lie to me? Tell me who you are. If you don't want to say anything, I won't force you. Patriarch, you are right. I can see the error of my ways. I lied to you. When I went to the authorities, a woman asked for my ID card. She kept asking for my name. I couldn't answer because I don't know. My only link is this bracelet. I think my mother gave it to me when I was born. I believe that she is still alive. She lives in Ouagadougou. How can I find her? I have listened to your story. I don't have the answer, but I will give you one piece of advice. Go to Ouagadougou and find your mother. Only she can tell you who your father is. We should head home. It is getting late. Good luck. I'd like some water. No, I don't need any chickens. You've had enough. Away with you. The city center and principally, the area of Dobrinja had to, like every other day, endure Serbian gunfire. The violence coincides with the Bosnian president's refusal to go to Geneva and participate in peace talks. Coming up, our second show on the great endemics of the decade. Bon appétit if you are eating dinner. We give him what we have. He doesn't say a word. Not a sound or a single complaint. We would never know his name. Meanwhile, a father approached us with his youngest daughter, the most vulnerable. And then, there are those with no strength nor the desire to fight. He can't eat or drink anything. Wake up! -Is that chicken for sale? -Yes. -How much? -300 francs. I'll pay 250. -Hey, shepherd! -Your money! You look familiar. Is that you, Wendemi? Yes. You're all grown up! What brings you here? I'm looking for my mother and a job. I'm not interested in that junk. I want American T-shirts. You know, I'm not a shepherd anymore. They call me Manson. Come with me. I have a meeting, but we can talk afterwards. -It's great to see you again. -Likewise. Wait here for a minute. I'm not happy. I've been waiting here for an hour. Calm down, you're right. The meeting was at one o'clock. I know what you girls are like. You are never on time. Where is he? I didn't see his car, but he won't be long. Tata, let's agree on one thing. You have to be kind to him. Don't treat him like a foreigner. Kiss him, caress him, make him happy. Have you seen the shoes the captain's daughter wears? If you are good, you'll be able to buy the same ones, two, three, or even four pairs. Have I ever let you down? No, you haven't. I trust you. Here he is. Don't forget to see me before you leave. I'll wait in the bar next door. Wait here for me. How are you? I'm good, boss. How are things going? With Manson, everything is always perfect. I don't doubt it. Take this. All of it? -Thank you! -You are welcome. Hey, Manson! Give me my share. You're right. Always pay your dues. I like how you do business. May our friendship be a long one. Bring us two beers. Wendemi, do you understand what is going on? Honestly, no. You know, in this city, there are wealthy people who like young girls. What do you mean? The guy who went upstairs with the girl at the hotel, he's a big deal. His name is Boureima. I put him in contact with the girl. It earned me 5,000 francs, a week's salary. Look, see that guy, sitting in the shadows? That's Lieutenant Ouedraogo. Look at the dancefloor. Do you see that girl dancing? She's his favorite. The girl we saw at the hotel… She was underage. In Ouagadougou, the eye sees, the mouth never talks. Everybody is in on it, even the hotel manager. -Did it go well? -Yes. Understand now? It isn't complicated. If you're up for it, we can work together. Sorry, this isn't the kind of job I'm looking for. Not your thing? Fine. You don't want to work with me? I'll be right back. Pay up. We're closing. Manson is paying. Someone must pay before I leave! Manson made the order. He left and he's not coming back. You have to settle the bill. I don't have any money. You don't have any money? Wait here. Sir, a customer is refusing to pay his bill. -Where is this jerk? -Over there. -Pay up. -I'm broke. Is this all you have? Little punk. I gave him a souvenir. He won't show his face here again. You're back! How's things? Let's go have a chat. All right, buddy? How's things? He was right on time. He's in Room 2. Manson strikes again! Oh, it's you! -How are you? -Good. Here we are. You can see how beautiful she is. You can do better than that. Thank you. Hey! Two beers. You see, Wendemi, we need to talk. In this town, survival is the only thing that matters. This is no place for do-gooders. Listen up. Hey, Manson, I'm not called "Hey." My name is Kiki. Don't open it. I'm not drinking. Listen, here, we drink and eat. If you stay long enough, you'll soon learn that. I'll tell you one thing. If you work with me, I can help you find your mother. Are you sure about that beer? Hey! Bring my friend a beer. -How is everyone in Koudougou? -They're fine. Let's drink to our reunion. You know, you're perfect for this line of work. You're a polite kid and good-looking. We'll make a killing. I'll show you the ropes. It isn't difficult. Every Saturday night, you get dressed up and come sit by the pool. You'll see a bunch of girls that you'd call "underage." They all need money. Some want to buy clothes or some other cheap trinket. That's when you strike. Drink up. You're my buddy now. Don't worry. God willing, in three months, you'll have enough money to get out of here. Don't forget that you promised to help me find my mother. Something's up. Why is Mimi leaving so soon? What's wrong? I told you I didn't like that guy. -He wanted me to do things. -And? I didn't want to, but he paid me. That's all right then. Hand it over. Don't worry. I'll find you a nice guy. There is one coming tomorrow, a businessman. He pays well. I need you to find two or three girlfriends for tomorrow. Okay. Here he comes. So, did everything go well? -No, it certainly didn't. -Why not? She doesn't know what she's doing. She is too young. Next time, I need you to get me a girl between 20 and 30 years old. No, that's no good. Here, we call that a dam. If you have fun, you just float. You could even drown. It needs to be tight. That's when you really feel it. I can get you some lovely 17 or 18-year-old girls. You can count on me. Okay, I'm counting on you. Manson, can I talk to you? How is this going to work? My three girlfriends are here. Fifi and Titi only like white men. And Assita is just starting out. I'm not sure about her. Look, Mimi, being a beginner isn't an issue. What's wrong with that? As for the others, no one's asking them to enjoy it. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. We should get back to the others. Who's he anyway? A friend. He doesn't look like he's from around here. True, but from now on, he's one of us. We'll meet here at 8 p.m. -Okay? -On the dot. Have a seat. Tonight is going to be a good night. You'll see. It's gonna be on fire! I'd like to take care of the girl called Assita. Why her? Since she is just starting out, she won't mess me around. Be careful. No flirting with those girls. It's for work. Try it on. It should fit. Actually, I agree with you. You can have her. I knew I could count on you. Honestly, things will go well tonight. -What's new with you, ladies? -Nothing much. No news is good news. I don't want to be home late. Wendemi, go with her. Then come back here. Fifi, your guy is here. What? That's Tata's guy! So? Fine, I'm mad at her anyway. This way, I can get back at her. Time to go. How's it going, buddy? Good, no complaints! -How's things? -Good. Take a seat. Do you live round here? I'm new in town. I'm living with Manson. Where are you from? Sabou, but I was born in Koudougou. My mother is from Koudougou too. Since she met my father, she has never been back. I'd love to go there one day. This work… Have you been doing it long? No, it's my first time. And I'm scared. My father works at the cloth factory. Every month, he brings back two bags of rice and three sacks of millet. He is never at home. He spends all his time in bars. He never buys us clothes. That's why Mimi offered me this work, so I can earn some money to buy some clothes. I said yes. What's wrong? Is something wrong? I don't think he's coming. Let's get out of here. He is here. Go ahead. I don't want to. If you aren't happy about it, you can get lost. I took you in off the streets, and now, you're disrespecting me. There are so many women who'd kill to be in your shoes. Don't worry. I'll be gone one day. Assita has been out every night this week. You're never around to stop her. No matter what I say, she never listens to me. Shut your mouth! Every month, I bring home two bags of rice and three sacks of millet. Other families in this town don't get nearly as much. Sacks of rice and millet? What about our children? You are lucky enough to eat your fill and you act like you're so smart. Here she is. Where have you been? -Where did you get those? -What? Don't act dumb. Those clothes! They're Mimi's. Who is Mimi? One of Fifi's friends. Who is Fifi? A friend. Fifi, Mimi, Chichi… I don't want you borrowing their clothes. From now on, if you set one foot outside at night, just you wait, I'll string you up myself. What is that? Just a bracelet. Let me see it. Don't they look similar? Don't ask me. It's Wendemi's bracelet. Who is Wendemi? He's Manson's friend. They're at the hotel. What were you doing at the hotel? I went with my friend Mimi. Do you know this boy? Yes. Since when? Since tonight. Well? Did everything go to plan? No. What happened? Didn't he turn up? Yes, but Assita wouldn't go through with it. Assita wouldn't go through with it? Okay, I see. You talked her out of it, didn't you? Useless dumbass! What's the matter? Shouldn't we have stayed to find out what happened to her? I don't want to do this anymore. Listen, keep it zipped for a while. How come God made you so stupid? He put a curse on you! I lost my bracelet at the hotel. I'm going back for it. Shut your mouth! Shut it and go to hell! Get lost! And don't ever come back. Who was the girl with? I saw her go upstairs with Manson. I didn't see anything after that because it was so busy. Manson? Who is this man? Where is he? I don't know his address. He comes here every afternoon. If he returns, don't let him leave. We'll handle it. Understood. See you then. Hello. Boureima. The police just left. Pin it on Manson. Make sure it never makes it to court. You know the police chief who comes here to drink whisky? He's a friend. Give him 50,000 francs on my behalf for his whisky. I'll organize a meeting for tonight. I have to find my bracelet. I'm sick of hearing about your bracelet. Stop going on about it and leave me alone! It isn't my fault that the girl died. Little bastard! Speak of the devil. Here comes his friend. -Where is Manson? -Why? Why?! You'll take us to him. Are you Manson? You are under arrest. What have I done? What haven't you done! You'll find out at the station. Let go! CENTRAL POLICE PRECINCT OUAGADOUGOU CHIEF OF POLICE Is this him? Yes, sir. Lock him up. Hello, Boureima! We just brought him in. That won't be a problem. I'll handle everything. Who is this guy? His friend. We found them together. What is his name? My name is Wendemi. Where are you from? Sabou. I just arrived here yesterday. Let him go. We're not interested in him. -Get out! -Take your wallet. Put him away. With God as my witness, it wasn't me. It was Boureima. Learn to shut your mouth if you want out. We're hungry! Give us some food! We need to eat! How will I find Assita? -Hello. -Hi. -Do you know Assita? -What is her last name? I don't know. One lives on the tarmacked road, one by the mosque, and one over there. Okay, thanks. Hey, Wendemi! -I was looking for you. -Likewise. -I lost my bracelet. -I took it. -You took it? -My mother has it now. What? She's been acting oddly. Why did your mother take my bracelet? Where is she? She went to the hotel. Wait! Did a woman ask about me? Yes, she went that way. Excuse me, are you Assita's mother? Yes. What do you want? My bracelet. Are you Wendemi? What are you doing with my daughter? Nothing. Nothing? What about those new clothes? Do you go to the hotel? What about that Manson guy? I don't understand any of it. I don't know this town. I just arrived. Where did you get this bracelet? I've had it since I was born. Where is your mother? She went to the hotel to return a bracelet. What's this about a bracelet? She hasn't prepared any food since this morning. She knows where to find me! What's this about a bracelet? Did you hear me? You haven't prepared dinner because of a bracelet? It's not a big deal. Get out! When you can explain yourself, you can come back. I'm sorry, Dad. You can leave too! Get out of my sight! You're barred! What are you sniffing about here for? Go away! To hell with you! What are you up to? -Don't you know me? -Who are you? My friend is in prison because of you. Your friend is in prison? What bullshit are you trying to pull? You've never met Fifi before either? Who is Fifi? Little punk! If I catch you, you'll end up in jail. That little son of a bitch! Look, Mom, it's Wendemi. What's wrong? This is my mother. Wendemi, you're the boy I abandoned in Koudougou. I'm your mother. If that's true, who is my father? Come with me to Koudougou. I'll take you to your father. I'll get my stuff. Wendemi, take me to Zaccharie. He is my father. I've got a problem. Can you help? Come on. Get in. Oh, goodness! Michel! Come see this. Wendemi is back with Cécile. -Which Cécile? -Zaccharie's daughter. I don't believe it! Is that Cécile? Give me my money. What's going on here? Dad, I came back to tell you the truth. I am Wendemi's mother. His father is Father George. What? Father George? My girl, please forgive me.
