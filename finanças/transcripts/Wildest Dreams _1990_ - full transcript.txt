Hey, Bobby. Where's your old man? He'll... I mean I'll be right down. He and Mom are getting ready to leave. -I'm in charge. -You? I'll be right down, Doug. Ow! Dad? -There's a delivery downstairs.-It can wait. Now, if you use the oven, make sure you turn it off. And your mother's plants, they need their feeding every three days. -You'll only be gone a week. -[mom] Which means you'll need to water them twice,dear. Once on Tuesday evening and then again on Friday morning. I know. I know when to water them. It's on the list you gave me, and the list Dad gave me. And it's probably written across the bathroom mirror in a secret code, which I'll spend one week trying to figure out, and it'll only say, "Water the plants." Are you through, dear?We're in a very much of a hurry. -Yes. I'll get a cab. -[dad] This is the first time we've left you in charge, Bobby. [mom] We just wanna leave you with enough instructions to cover any emergency. I'll call you at the conventionif there's any problems. Don't worry. Joan and I can handle everything. Remember, empty the registereach night and make the deposits -the next morning in-- -In person. Don't use the deposit machines. -What's this? -Uh, nothing. Uh, come on. You got to hurry. [Doug] If someone ain't out here in ten seconds, -I'm leaving this crate... -He'll leave it there anyway. Well, if you'd be nicer,maybe he'd help you bring it in. -I am nice. He's the jerk.-[Doug] One, two, three, four... Remember, have Joan clean all this junk. Come on, you'll be late for your bus. Honey, he's fine. We better hurry. It's the first vacation we've had in a while. -You're not chickening out now.-[Doug] ...seven, eight, nine... -Good thing you got here, kid. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Taxi! Taxi! The taxi awaits. Will someone sign this so I can split? Bobby will. He's in charge. Now, make sure you eat, dear. -Tell Joanie to make you eat. -Yes, Mom. Yeah! [laughs] Woo! -Which line? -Right here, pal. Calm down. -Wow. -[Doug] Hey! How about you two sitting on my face? Shh. -Pig! -Ow! [Doug] Oink, oink, oink. Thanks a lot. See you later, kid. -Good luck being in charge. -Aren't you gonna help? -Hey, you need some help? -[Bobby] Joan. Yeah. I sure do. -Did your parents leave? -You missed them by minutes. Did they leave you any lists? -Ha ha ha ha. -Sorry I asked. [grunts] So, what your dad order from Egypt? Probably a crate full of junk. Did you set up this morning, Bobby? I've only been working heresince I was old enough to walk, and he still doesn't think I can set up. Coffee? Yeah, but only if Stella's delivering. Let's see what Dad got this time. [crate creaks] Hi. This is Joan over at Delaney's. Yes. Good morning to you too, Stella. The usual. Thank you. Well? Everything is broken. Wait till I get a hold -of that guy. -Calm down. I think it's supposed to be that way. Yeah. These are Egyptian artifacts. You're kidding? They must be worth of fortune. Antiquities need to be in one piece to be valuable. Is that whatthey're teaching you in college? It's my field, Bobby. Looks like your dad got a greatdeal on a crate full of-- -Crap? -[Joan] Yeah. Wow. It's beautiful. They must have put it in by mistake. Bobby, this is the real thing. This is a perfect specimen. Gee, that's real pretty. How much you want for it? Stella, we haven't priced this yet. Stupid me. Now that you know I wanna buy it, you'll probably charge me double. Oh, I would never do that to you, Stella. Never double. That's sweet. Here's your coffees. Now, that's $1.10. -Your folks around here, Bobby?-Uh, they left 15 minutes ago. You gonna throw a party while they're gone? Uh, I don't know. Uh, maybe you'd liketo come over for dinner tonight and help plan something like a party. Sure. I love parties. Joan can come. I can come. You can come. Oh. -How's 6:00? -Six what? Tonight at 6:00? Meet me here. Oh. Oh. Yeah. Sure. Oh, and I want that bottle. It'll look great on my toilet. -See you. -[Bobby] See you. [door closes] Stella is coming over for dinner tonight. This is the greatest! The greatest! [laughs] Yeah. So I heard. So let's finish unpacking this crate. -Okey-dokey, boss. -Do you see anything on that slip about this bottle? No. This is the last thing on the list. There must be a mistake. [Joan] I can't find anything about it in my book. You just so happened to have a book about Egyptian antiquities? No. Bottles. The kind that date back before Christ. You know, all the undamaged specimens were found in burial places like, uh, pyramids and tombs. Bobby, this is really weird, this could be worth a fortune. Well, what's your book say? I don't know anything about hieroglyphics. I'll call the company. You know, Professor Foley might know. Who's that? He's my language teacher. Hi. This is Bobby calling from Delaney Antiques. Uh, yes. We got it. That's why I'm calling. Uh... No, no, no. I realize everythingis supposed to be broken, but there's an extra bottle that's not on this list that you sent us. No. No. I'm not complaining. Uh, I just thought someone made an error or... You packed the box yourself and there was no bottle? Well, maybe someone else in the company may-- Okay. Okay. Listen I was just trying to... -He hung up. -[hangs up phone] Oh, well. Let's open. Bobby? Bobby? -Bobby, Stella's here. -Where? Nowhere. I just wanted to get your attention. Very funny. [music playing] "Put in oven for 60 minutes at 350 degrees. Reduce to 300 degrees for another 30 minutes and enjoy. Love, Mom." One for Bobby. One for Stella. [chuckles] And now the couple retires to an evening of romance. Let's see. That's good. Candles. Candles. Plates, silverware, napkins. Wine glasses. The wine glasses. Oh, Stella. Stella, this will bea night to remember. Ow! [cash register dings] Here's your change. -Ma'am, your change. -What? Oh. -How much is that bottle? -It's already sold. Oh. Well, it's beautiful. Something hypnotic about it. Thanks. -To whom is it sold? -To Stella. She wants it for her toilet. Don't you dare give that to her until after I've spoke to Professor Foley. I have a feeling this is not a piece of toilet decor. Okay. Okay. It's 6:00. You're gonna be late for your class. You're so considerate. Give Stella my best. And don't you give that to that waitress. Okey-dokey, boss. [shop bell dings] [whistles] 6:30? Yeah. She'll be here any minute. [exhales] I bet Stella looks just like that. [sighs] It's quarter after seven. Where is she? [groans] [Stella giggling] That will be all for today. Class dismissed. [students chattering] -Professor Foley? -Yes, Ms. Peabody. I, um... I came across thisbottle in the shop where I work. Oh, that's nice. Now, if you'll excuse me, dear,I've got things to do. Look, it had this writing on it.It looks like hieroglyphics. Is-- Is this all the writing on the bottle? Oh, no. There was a lot more. I just couldn't make it up. [Prof. Foley] Is there anychance I could see this bottle? -Oh, of course. When? -Now! Well, I can't now, but we open the shop at 9:00. Professor Foley, can you tell me what it says? Uh, nothing. Nothing. I'll need to see the rest of the hieroglyphics before I know what it all means. I'll keep it, if you don't mind. No, of course not. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. [Prof. Foley] Good night. Foley. Foley... this may finally be it. Joan? Stella? Is somebody here? Oh, no! The chicken! No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, shit! Ow! Ow! [groans] -Oh, water. Water. -[wind howling] -[water running] -Oh. Oh, much better. Oh. Oh. Oh. God, I'm gonna get killed. [sobbing] I should've never invited Stella over. I wish this place was back to normal. [coughs] Wish number one? You got it, Master. [clicks fingers] [sighs]Not bad after 2,000 years, huh? Oh, your bird's over in that... -That thing. -The refrigerator? That's a refrigerator? You know, I've always heard about them, but I've never really seen one. I could use one to keep my beer cold in that bottle. What's the matter with you? You look like you've seen Caesar's ghost. I don't look that bad. And besides, look at you, you're no Mark Anthony either. Who are you? How did you do that? The name's Dancee. And everything is back to normal, if you call this normal, because you wished it. What? [Dancee] Now, you've used up one wish, Master. And if you could please get a move on with this. I've got over 2,000 years of partying to catch up on to and time is wasting. Hey, wait up, Master. I didn't mean that about Mark Anthony. Oh, he was a schmuck anyway. [clicks fingers] -Oh. Oh. How-- -How many wishes do you have left? Two. And who's this girl here? Some kind of sacred goddess or something? Who are you? What do you want from me? Calm down. That's how I ended up in the bottle in the first place. And I would really rather not end up in there again. You know what I mean? -Miss... -[Dancee] Dancee. Dancee. I don't understand a thing you're saying. Oh, okay. I see.Let me give it to you straight. I'm a genie put in the bottle because I got caught doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing. Oh, but sure had fun doing it. A genie? Yeah. Your garden variety type. You get three wishes, I grant them. You release me. You're happy. I'm happy. You know, you're very lucky. Most genies have wish restrictions, time limit guarantees,part replacements not included. None of that shit with me. You wish, I grant, and it's done. I don't believe this. I don't believe this. You say you'll grant me a wish? I already have. You've got two left. I got two left? Okay. Change into that. Into that? Master, I don't mind taking my clothes off if-- But... Into this bikini. [gasps] That's a bikini? I was sitting on this thing they called a radio a few years ago. Or was it a few hundred years? I get so mixed up in that bottle. Anyway, they kept singing a song -about this itsy-- -The bikini. Oh, yeah. Right. Uh, is white and pink okay? -Sounds good. -All right. [clicks fingers] So what do you think? I kind of like it. Those fucking veils have had it anyway. It was time for a new wardrobe.Two thousand years is a long time to go without changing your undies. -This is incredible. -Incredible? -Master, this body is heavenly.-Yeah. That too. -I got two wishes. -Uh-uh. One wish. This was number two. And I got to thank you for it. You're a very generous master. This will get me in a lot of doors. Now, let's tackle that third wish. What is it you really want? What you really need? Gosh. I can't think. I mean, it's not every day a guy could have anything he wants. -It is anything, isn't it? -You name it. I don't know. I don't know. -How about money? -I've got to be careful. I've heard of people wishing for something, but leaving out part of their wish, and then living to regret it. How about fame? Fame is anything. [Stella giggling] Whatever. To be in love. To have true love. -No, that's not it. -You want sex? Well, that's part of it. But I want more. I wish for an honest, true, passionate, ever-expanding kind of love. What? I thought you wanted sex. Well, that's the passion part. The kind of love that lasts a lifetime. That's what I wish for. I wish for the kind of lovethat will last a lifetime. With a girl, right? Yes. With a girl. I got to word this carefully. I wish for the kind of love that will last a lifetime with a girl. A gorgeous, sexy, sensual, lusting kind of girl, like Stella. Your wish is my command. Have a good life, Master. I know I plan to. [clicks fingers] [Stella] Oh, Bobby. Bobby, I have to see you. Thanks, Dancee. I have to kiss you right away, Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Oh. [moaning] -I've wanted to do that forever.-You have? -Forever. -You want to plan our party? Plan? No. I'm in the mood to rock and roll now. But where? I don't really know how to rock and roll. Stick with me. I'll show you how to put together a party. [moaning] You got a problem, kid? Uh, no. Uh, I don't think I do. No, I don't have a problem. Do you? You know who you're talking to? Oh, Bobby, don't wasteyour time with that creep. I want you in one piece tonight. -Let's get out of here. -Sure thing, Stella. -Stella, what did I do? -Nothing. I just happen to be in love with Bobby. -So scram. You're in our way. -Yeah. Scram. [rock music playing] [cheering] ♪ A miserable girl With curlers in her hair ♪ ♪ Your father is a sucker But I don't really care ♪ ♪ You're making rich and poor ♪ Your face looks like a rat I wanna make you suffer ♪ ♪ I wanna break your neck [screaming] [vocalizing] ♪ A rancid, rancid pig Your body really smells ♪ ♪ Like the bile vapors That are coming up from hell ♪ [Bobby] Ow! ♪ Cold, diarrhea And all disease come forth ♪ [indistinct shouting] Hey, everybody, you got to take it easy, okay?

It's on my boyfriend. [cheering] -Oh, wow! -You're the man. Hey, let's cook the pot chicken. -Yeah. -Yeah. Let's go! Woo-hoo! [Bobby] Hey! Hey, you guys! That's our dinner. Don't worry. I'm sure they'll save us a leg or a breast or a... [giggling] Wow. This is incredible. What did I tell you? Stick with me. I'm going to see if they left anything in the kitchen... for us. [moans] [chuckles] [panting] They left the cake. Hey, that's ours. No way. This is my main course. Excuse us, but we have some serious communicating to perform. -What? -Come on, Bobby. Oh. Okay. Oh, Bobby. Yummy, yummy, yummy. Mm. Chocolate cake is my favorite thing. -My release button. -Oh, yeah. -[Bobby] Oh. -Oh. My absolute passion. Oh. Oh. Oh, Stella. Stella. Uh, I love you, Stella. I love you too, Bobby. Oh, Stella. [moaning] Oh, baby. No. Oh, Bobby. [moaning] [snoring] [alarm clock rings] [Bobby groans] This love will never last a lifetime. What's up, Master? She's definitely not the one. -How do you know? -If she was the one you wouldn't have popped back in now, would you? Well, you've got a point. Honey, keep the champagne cold,and that chariot revved up, and those muscles toned. Oh, I'll be right back. [clicks fingers] [sighs] -What's with the mud? -Shh. She'll hear you. [Dancee] She can't hear or see me. -Only you can. -Lucky me. Damn right. Mud wrestling. Is this it? -Was it any fun? -Once was enough. I hear you. You don't like it the first time, fuck it. Well, what about my lifetime love? Don't use that tone with me, Master. You're the one who interrupted me in the middle of my fir... [chuckles] Well, the first in 2,000 years. And you're worried about falling in love? I'm so horny I could take you on, but I'm not allowed. So can we please get on with this lifetime love shit? Well, maybe I need someone, uh, a little more caring, you know? A little more domesticated. Someone who likes to stay home and cook, you know? -Like your mother? -No. Not like my mother. But someone mature. Someone who'll take good care of me and good care of my home, you know? [knocking on door] Oh, shoot. That must be Joan. Stella? Stella? Wake up, Stella. You have to go home now. I'm going downstairs. [clicks fingers] Stella, come on. Wake up. Oh, Bobby. I love you so much. -That was the best night ever. -[Bobby grunts] -Yo, man, thanks for the party.-Yes. You know where to find us. Yeah. I know exactly where not to look. [Stella] Talk to you later, lover boy. Oh. Hi, Joan. Bye, Joan. -Did I interrupt something? -Uh, no. I'm glad you arrived. I would've slept all day if you hadn't. Yeah, well, you look like you should have. -How old is she? -I don't know. -Hey, Joan, how old are you? -[Joan] Twenty. Why? -Yeah. Why? -I don't know. Too young? -For what? -Who are you talking to? Uh, no one. I'm just a little dazed this morning trying to get my thoughts together. While you're working on the impossible, why don't you do what you're qualified to do? -Ooh. -Shh. -She can't hear me. -Don't shh me. I got some looking around to do.I'll see you later. Where's the bottle? Where's the bottle? -What bottle? -The bottle. The bottle. -Good morning, Professor Foley.-Uh, is this it? Yes. Professor, this is Bobby Delaney. -Who are you? -My folks own this place. Oh, hi. How much do you want for this? -It's not for sale. -But I must have it. Well, maybe you could borrow it, Professor. No. That bottle stays here. Why do you want it? Uh, the writing.I wanna figure out the writing. Hieroglyphics is my... My hobby. Well, you're welcome to copy it all down. -Got to clean up a bit. -Good idea. Joan, dear, don't you think it would be all right if I, uh, borrowed it for just an hour let's say? -Sorry. He's the boss. -Well... Is there a chance I could-- I could perhaps look at it privately? Well, this is about as private as we get around here. Thanks. Can you decipher it, Professor? Well, I'm not one to make wild guesses, Joan. Facts, facts, and more facts. That's what a true researcher needs to back up his claims. Hey, Professor, figure it all out? I'll need my books for this one. Thank you so much for letting me touch your bottle. Uh, I got a couple of errands to run if you don't mind. You close. Master, you got to help me. All these broads -are beginning to look alike. -Your wish is my command. Hey, that's my line. Who was that asshole -that just came out of the shop?-Oh, that was Professor Foley. He was sure interested in that bottle. Not to worry. I'm yours till the wish is wished. He can rub that bottle for the rest of his life and never even get a rattle. What's it say on the bottle anyway? Fuck if I know. I don't read hieroglyphics. And, uh, what do you think of this little outfit? I like it. You got to leave something to the imagination. So what happens when this wish is granted? Where do you go? Once you find your true love, you're a free spirit. Oh, not in the spirit spirit sense, but as a woman ready to take on the world. And let me tell you, they better stand back, 'cause Dancee is gonna get her way this time, Cleopatra or no Cleopatra. -You really knew her? -[Dancee] Knew her? Master, she's the one who had me bottled. Well, you know, after she caught me with Mark, she had one of her mystics put a curse on me. Wow. Hey, what are they doing in there? This is a laundromat. It's where people go to wash their clothes. Really? Sure beats the hell out of pounding rocks down by the river. You know, I remember the time when Cleopatra used to get a hair up her ass and I'd have to go trudging down to the water and wash her... clothes. Well, well. Have we found our possible sugar plum? It looks like love to me. Yeah. You know, we walk around the city all day, we end up four blocks from where you live. Well, you know what they say about finding everything you need in your own backyard. Fuck that shit, man. Are you sure she's the right one? [Bobby] Look at her. She's beautiful, gentle, sexy. And she folds clothes just like the domestic type. Yeah, she does. That's the one. All right. I've said it before. Have a good life, Master. -Bye. -[clicks fingers] Hi. I'm Isabelle. Hi. I'm Bobby. Let me do your laundry for you. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, I don't have any with me. Oh. I can wash what you're wearing. Uh, thanks. Maybe some other time. Well, silly of me. If I would have washed what you're wearing, -you'd be completely naked. -[laughter] Can I make dinner for you? Oh, sure. Wonderful. Thank you. I'm afraid there's not much in the way of food back at my apartment. There's a grocery store just around the corner. We can go there and buy everything I need to prepare you a feast. What do you like? I can make anything you want. And if I don't already know how to make it, I'll learn. I love you. I know it's here. I know it's here. I know it's here. I know it must be here. It's got to be here somewhere. I know it's here. I know it's here. It's here somewhere. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. Oh. Calm down, Foley. We'll find it. We must remain calm. Yes. [grunts] [shop bell dings] [Bobby] Hi, Joan. How was business? -Hi. I'm Isabelle. -Hi. Uh, business was kind of slow today. The closing sheets are here. And I guess I'll be leaving. [Isabelle] Would you like to join us for dinner? [Bobby] Uh, no, Isabelle. Joan has class. It's Saturday, remember? Oh, yeah. Well, I'm sure you have other plans, so if you'll excuse us, I'll, um, see you in the morning. Um, would you lock up? Yeah. See you in the morning. Heaven. I think I'm in heaven. I should apologize for this mess, Isabelle. You see, last night we had a little party, and-- Apologize?Apologize for nothing, darling. I love you. Where are the cleaning supplies? Under the sink. What a wonderful place for cleaning supplies. Oh. Oh, Isabelle. You don't have to do that. Oh, Bobby, yes, I do. [screams] Furniture polish with lemon. My favorite. Oh. Look at that shine. I can see myself in it. And I can see you too. Dust balls everywhere. [truck horn honks] Hey, Isabelle, are you done? I'm hungry. -Hi, Louie. -Where's, uh, Isabelle? -She ain't here, Louie. -Where is she? Don't know. Uh, she left a couple of hours ago. Her and the Delaney boy were walking up the street in that direction. -Who's this Delaney kid? -Delaney Antiques. A couple of blocks over on Bleecker Street. Ruth and Frank, real nice people. Antiques? What the hell does she want with used stuff? I buy her new. Everything she-- -I buy her new. Everything she---Louie. Louie, the clothes. She left the clothes. -[Louie] She left the clothes? -[woman] Uh-huh. That ain't like her. No. You sure she was feeling okay? Looked all right to me. [vacuum whirring] -You through now? -Yes. I think so. -You are? -Yeah. [moaning] [screams] The shelves. The top of the shelves. Oh. Bobby, will you help me? Lift me on your shoulders. Do you really have to clean the top of the shelves now? Yes, I do. Lift me on your shoulders. -Okay. One leg. -[Bobby] Okay. -Okay?-[Bobby] All right. Now, get up. -Yeah. -Okay. Can you get up now? -[Bobby] Yeah. Hold on. -I'm holding on. -[Bobby] Oh, okay. -Okay. Turn around. -This one in here? -Yes. Yes. -Close-- Oh, yeah. -[Bobby] Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, little to the right. -[Bobby] Okay. -The right. -The left. Left. The left. -[Bobby] Okay. Your left? -Oh. You comfortable, honey? -[Bobby] Oh, yes. -All right. -[Bobby] And after we clean these shelves, there's lots more -in the bedroom. [chuckles] -Oh. -[alarm buzzing]-Oh, you'll have to put me down. That's the timer. Dinner should be ready soon. -[Bobby] Okay. -[grunting] Oh. You're so playful. Need your dinner though. Keep that strength up. [humming] There's lots more shelves to be dusted in the bedroom. Oh, you silly. There's a time for everything. Now is the time for feasting, not cleaning. Mm. Perfect. Does everything smell good to you, darling? Smells delicious. [chuckles] Well, we've 30 minutes to spare.What would you like to do? -Let me show you the bedroom. -Wonderful. -Lead me onward. -[chuckling] -Come this way. -Oh, it's so clean. It's in here. [grunts] [moaning] Mind if I get a little more comfortable? No. Not at all. Please be my guest. [Bobby] Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. -Ew. -[Bobby] Oh. Ew. Ew! What's the matter? Uh, I thought you said now is the time for feasting, not for cleaning. A woman's work is never done. [tuts] When was the last time you laundered these? [Bobby] I don't know. But I think they're good for one more round, if you know what I mean? I know what you mean, but, no, they're not. They're filthy. They're... [groans] Ew. -What are you doing? -Now, you stay right there. This should only take a couple of hours. But dinner. I'll turn everything down a bit. It'll be even more succulent that way. All the raw meat juices mixing with the potatoes and the carrots. Mm. Oh. Hey, Bobby. It's me, and I'm through with work. -I'm all yours. -Oh, shit. It's Stella, and I'm here to party, party, party. Hey, Bobby, lover boy. It's Stella. -Who's that, darling? -Uh, a friend, loves antiques. Can't keep her away. Oh, how sweet. You go take care of her while I finish up in the bedroom, bathroom, laundry room, and whatever elseneeds my attention. I need your attention. Bobby, are you up there? I know you're up there. I can see you moving. Woo. I'm starting without you. [truck horn honking] Hey, Isabelle! -Isabelle! -Isabelle, come here. -Yes, darling. -Who's that? Oh, that's Louie, my husband. -Your what? -My husband. The man I used to love. Oh, God! Hey, Isabelle, where are you? I'm hungry! Oh, he's always hungry. Maybe we should invite himto dinner. And your friend too. No, Isabelle. That's not a good idea. Look, I think you have a fewthings to take care of at home. -[Stella] Bobby! -[Bobby] After you fix things. [Isabelle] Oh, he's a lamb. Get dressed. Hurry. Party, party, party! Boy, she sure does wanna getat those antiques, doesn't she? [Louie] Isabelle! Oh, I'll tell Louie it's over with. Then I can move in, and we can get married after the divorce. Isabelle, we must remain calm and act maturely -in this situation! -Of course. You just go on home, now. Think about everything. We'll talk in the morning. I think you owe that to Louie. He seems like a really nice guy. We wouldn't wanna hurt his feelings, would we? No. You're right. You're so considerate. That's why I love you. [Bobby] Go. Go. [panting] That sure wasn't the one. [coughs] Fuck. I haven't even gotten to first base yet. Don't wipe it off.I'll be back in a little while. -That's what you said last time.-Hey, don't get wise with me. You gladiators win a chariot race and you think you got Rome by the balls? That'll tie you over. [clicks fingers] -Hi, Louie. -[Louie] Where you been? -Oh-- -I never knew -you liked antiques. Come on. -I don't. Then what was you doing in this used furniture joint anyhow? Come on. Hey. Hey! [sobbing] Have you seen Bobby Delaney? Yes, I have. Hope you find something you like. Oh, Bobby! Bobby, open this door! I want to party! I think I see the problem. [clicks fingers] -Wrong one? -[Bobby] Yeah. Wrong one. And what about Stella? Why is she still downstairs acting like she loves me? Because she, uh... She does. Well, do something about it. Twirl and shake and unzap her. Uh, I can't. I forgot. What? You mean you left me hereknowing she'd still be after me? Well, the more, the merrier, -I always say. -Well, that's not what I say! Hey, don't get huffy with me, Master. Let me think. Let me think. Hurry down, Bobby. It's gonna be all gone. Think faster. Well, while I'm thinking, why don't you decide exactly what kind of woman you really want. Not until you break the spell on Stella and Isabelle. [Dancee] Well, that may take a while. Why don't you get me a beer while I think about it. Uh-oh. I was right. I was right. [laughs] I was right. I was right. I was right. [laughs] I'm going to be famous. [kisses] No one must get in my way. No one. Bobby, come on. What's taking you so... [hiccups] ...long. [laughs] [Dancee] The river Nile flows and weeps in the moonless sky, long and deep, another time, another space, we'll find us all back in this place. She looks like she's having a good time. Come on. [laughs] Look, Master, this genie stuff is all new to me. I mean, I've been reading booksfor the past 2,000 years. This is my first job experience. [Bobby] Great. And I'm that job, right? [Dancee] Yeah. You're damn right. Now, let's find that love of your life. I'll take care of the other two later. What kind of female do you really wanna share the rest of your life with? [Bobby] Well, my first two choices sure were wrong. [Dancee] Not wrong, just a little off. [Bobby] Maybe this time I need someone passionate, but mature. Someone aggressively confident. That describes half the girls in New York. Could you be a little more specific? -Classy. -And single. Definitely. And remember sexy. [women screaming] Rachel Richards. -Who's that? -A movie star. -What's that? -It's... Never mind. -She's gorgeous. -Confident, aggressive, mature. Certainly sexy. -What? -What about it? -What about what? -Her, silly. Wait. Wait. Wait a minute. I have a 4:00 call tomorrow. I have to be on my way, okay? -[indistinct chatter] -I must be on my way. You really think so? What do I know? Looks like a hot mama to me. Okay. Okay. I'm ready. -You have a good-- -Good life. Yeah. You too. -Goodbye. -Bye. [clicks fingers] [indistinct chatter] Wow. Who are you? I'm Bobby Delaney. I'm Rachel Richards. And I love you. Come. Where to, Ms. Richards? Bobby's place. Tell him your address, Bobby. Down in the village, on Bleecker Street, Delaney Antiques. [fans screaming] Where have you been all my life? I've been on Bleecker Street. So is the address of this antique joint. [chuckles] Don't you dare use that toneof voice with me, sl... Dexter. [chuckles] Tell himyour address, Bobby, sweetheart. It's 84 Bleecker Street, across from the bakery. That's enough. That's enough. Did you get that... Dexter? Oh, yes, ma'am. I'm-- I'm sorry. Excuse me for interrupting. Don't you think you're a little rough on him? Rough? [laughs] I'm never rough on those who attend to me, only in charge. -Oh. I see. -Now, where were we? You-- You were licking my ear. -Ow! Ow! -[laughs] Don't worry. Get used to it. [panting] -Who's that? -Shh. We don't wanna wake her. Whatever. Dexter, get the rest of the supplies -and come with us. -[Bobby] What supplies? Things to make me and you happy. Come on. [laughs] Too small. Too bright. This room. [Dexter panting] [rattling] So, you're Bobby. [panting] I'll go get the rest of the things. There's more? Oh, Bobby. Help me with this record. Now! What is it? [Rachel] You'll see. Something to help me get into the mood. [tango music playing] You ready to dance, Bobby? Oh, my God. Ow! Oh, great outfit, Ms. Richards. Shut up, slave. Get to work. Right away. Right away. -[Bobby] Ow! -Promise me you'll beat me. I don't make promises to you, slave. Get to work. Come on, my sweet... My, oh, my. Rub the bottle in a circular motion... [panting] You're not devoted, naked! Don't. [tango music continues] [phone ringing] Hello? Hello? I just wanted to let you know that I miss you, Bobby. No, no, no. Don't say anything. I just wanted to let you know that I love you. -Who is that? -Uh, a friend. A girlfriend? -Why you... -Don't. Wait. -What are you doing? -Shut up, slave. Dance with your master. I'll have you know that I'm the master. -Says who? -Says Dancee. Dancee. [laughs] Yes. Let's "“dancee"” more. There. [groans] Done with Dancee, slave? Let's check out the game room. -Fun. -Ow! -Fun. -Ow! -Fun. -Ow! [laughs] Circular motion to the right. Oh, maybe it was a circular motion to the left. [moans] Where's the genie? Come to me, genie. Come to me. That little worm, Bobby, must have already released the genie. No. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. -Shut up, slave. -But I'm your slave. You're my scumbag. This is my slave. Ooh, I like that even better. Scumbag! Oh, I love being a scumbag. -[laughs] -Shut up! -Come on. -Oh, what are you doing? -Shut up! Get in. -Ow! I'm in. I'm in. Man the pulley. -[Dexter snickers] -What? Oh. -[Rachel] Get in. -[Bobby] Oh. [Rachel] Shut up. [Bobby screams] [laughter] Please... Please let me down. Uh, I-- I'll do anything you want. [laughs] That's why you're here, to do anything I want. [evil laugh] -[Bobby groaning] -[Rachel laughing] Hmm. I think I'll wait till they're done. [Bobby groaning] [machine beeping] -[Rachel] What's that? -Oh, it's your Calltend. They want you on the set in half an hour. Just when I was getting to my favorite part. Secure him, Dexter. We'll save him for later. Yes, Master. See you later, wimp. How do I look, Dexter? -Oh, ravishing. -I know. -The public awaits. -[Dexter laughs] [phone ringing] [line ringing] [groans] She's gonna kill me. But that wasn't the one. What the fuck happened this time? Sorry. I know. I know. Believe me, I'm not coming backhere again. We're taking care of this once and for all. -Right, Master? -Right. [sighs] Ooh. Pretty professional, huh? Please just let me down. [Dancee] Pretty hardcore, huh? Yeah. You sure can pick them. Hurry, Dancee. These ropes are killing me. [Dancee] Hurrying as fast as I can, Master. And don't call me master anymore. I've had enough of that shit to last a lifetime. [Dancee] Okay. I-- I almost have it. [groans] [Dancee] Ah, there you go, Mas--Uh, I mean, honey. Thanks, Dancee. You're a lifesaver. I think you forgot something the last time you left. What? Stella. Isabelle. And now we have a Rachel. -Oh, that. -Yes, that. Look, can I just cancel this true love wish? Uh, I-- I'll take money, a yacht, jewels. You name it. I can't do that. Why not? Because the only way to undo a wish is if you die. Well, I'm not gonna die just to cancel out a wish. Uh, there's got to be another way besides death. What would happen to you if I should die? I'd be at the mercy of my next owner. [Bobby] You mean you'd have to start from scratch? -Three wishes to the next owner?-Yup. Well, we better get started on this last wish, so you can get your freedom, and I can get some rest. Rest in peace, you mean. You better freshen up. Couldn't I just take a nap? You're the onewho needs to finish this thing, so let's go. [Bobby] While I get dressed, you start thinking about how to unzap those three old monsters after me. Oh, you don't mind If I take this with me -when I leave, do you? -The poem, Dancee. The poem. Oh, okay. Okay. Uh, pharaohs old and pharaohs new, whirling sand dunes embracing you, relieve the innocent from forgotten spells, and set the pathway straight to hell. -[laughs] -Well? Uh, it's coming. But, uh, let's go. Come on. Let's go hunting. Let me think it through clearly this time. What? Last time, I was swept away into the moment. No more. Ooh. I kind of like being swept away. I don't want some partying punk rocker. Okay. No more Stellas. And I don't want someone to play mother. Oh, and not another Isabelle. And I especially don't want anyone kinky. Scratch the movie star. Let's make it simple this time. Simple. Intelligent, organized, mature. Uh, a girl who's pretty, enjoys some sexuality. Ooh. Now we're getting to the good part. [laughs] -That's it. -That's it? Will we be back by 9:00, do you think? Uh, I don't know. I got to leave the door open for Joan. Let's go. [Bobby] So what about the poem? [Dancee] I'm working on it. Hey, how does this sound? Two thousand years of waiting alone inside my bottle for someone to phone. [Bobby] You had a phone? [Dancee] Uh, well, no, but it sounded good. -[Bobby] Keep thinking. -[Dancee] Okay. Okay. Sunday morning doesn't seem to be the hunting hour. Oh, relax. You know, these buildings in New York, they amaze me. I can't figure out how did the workers get the things all the way to the top? I mean, the pyramids were big, but these are humongous. Well, they have machines to do it. Machines, computers do everything these days. What is a computer? Well, it's hard to explain. They're these little microchips and... That's a computer. [Dancee] That builds all these buildings? [Bobby] Yeah, in a way. She is beautiful. Hey. What do you think? What do you think? -Looks intelligent, organized...-And pretty? -I don't need your coaxing. -Oh, sorry. What the hell? Zap her. Ooh, I hope this is the one. Uh, wait! What about Stella, Isabelle and Rachel? Uh, with your luck, I'll be back in a few hours. But what if this is the real thing? Hey, um, what did you just say?The real thing? Uh, that strikes a brainwave. Um, uh... You remember how to unzap them all? Ooh, it's coming. It's coming. Ooh. Ooh. And I'd like to be too -so I'll see you later. -Uh, but-- [clicks fingers] -Do I know you? -I don't think so? [clicks fingers] The Frank and Clarke merger. You're on the Clarke team, right? No. But I sort of own an antique shop. Really? Now, that's an area of investment I've never dabbled in before, but I hear there's a lotof money to be made in antiques. -Well, not that. -Wait. Wait. There's something going on here. Some sort of transaction I'm feeling towards you. I've never felt this way before. Could it be love? I don't know. I hope so. I feel like I'm walking on air.It's wonderful. Now, tell me about all the moneyyou've made in antiques. [Bobby] Well, I guess the shop takes in around... Well, I don't know. You see, my father owns the-- [woman] Family money. Well, that means your capital's been working for you for a long time. Now, exactly how many years has your family been buying -and selling antiquities? -Well, I guess... Isn't this wedding announcementa little sudden? You've always been very adamant about being the independent woman. Well, Betty, when the right mancame along, all I can say is there's no reason to let my silly pride stand in the way. I must admit, I am looking forward to a man -dominating my life. -Oh, really? Could you tell us who this Mr. Wonderful is? -Bobby Delaney. -Oh. And where is the wedding ceremony being held? Oh, it's being held at his parent's antique shop, in the village, this afternoon. Thank you, Rachel. Well, there you have it, folks. Hollywood most eligible... -I'll pack? -I'll call a cab. [Bobby] We'll be in my place in a minute. -You don't need to show me---I don't have a minute to spare. I have a future to program. Our future. [Bobby] Oh. Pass me the home investment brochure. It should be in the side pocket there. Ooh. Boy, that's neat. The world at our fingertips wherever we go. -[chuckles] -The home investment brochure. -Please. Please. -Uh, I'm looking. -I'm looking. -Oh. Quickly. Oh. In two years, we'll haveour second home in The Hamptons. This is it. Ooh. This looks like a job for me. [shop bell dings] [gasps]Oh, Bobby, this place is heaven. It's an absolute mess. It doesn't look like anybody has done an ounce of bookwork in years. Well, I know some has been done. -I mean, for tax purposes and---Your tax returns, -can I see them? -Sure. But wouldn't you like to go upstairs for a few minutes, stretch out a while, talk about money market -funds, bonds, facts? -Later. Later, darling. Later. I'll set up the computer. You go get the tax returns. Uh, they're upstairs. [woman] Well, then I'll just make myself comfortable. I'll be right back. [snores] -Oh, God. -[Stella snores] I hope you're not getting too comfortable, because I have this sort of... [gasps] What did you say? Uh, well, uh, I thinkwe better do this another time. Oh, no, no. The sooner the better. Give me those returns, let me set the books straight. I'm not sure we should be goingthrough all my father's stuff. Oh, wow! Oh, Bobby, this is going to be a cinch. Get me the ledgers, honey. I'm going to make usone rich husband and wife team. Kiss me. The ledgers. The ledgers. Um, here's another. Oh, Bobby, you're the greatest lover I've ever had. -More, more ledgers. More! -Uh, how about sales list? Oh, bring them here. Bring them here. Oh. Oh, Bobby.

More, more, more, more. -What are these? -Uh, bills. -Have they been paid? -No. [woman] Oh, unpaid bills wanting my money, wanting my attention. Oh, Bobby. [moans] Well, Dancee, old girl.

Here, let yourselves in. I'll be back in, uh... How should I know? Right. How should you know? Why don't you guys go back and get comfortable? Get out of those leather loincloths. -You must be hot in them. -[keyboard clacking] [clicks fingers] If this isn't a lesson you can'tjudge a book by its cover, -I don't know what is. -She's going to make us rich. Oh, better you buy a racehorse.You know, my couple of friends, -we just---Did you remember the poem yet? No. I've been busy. Yeah. Leather loincloths, right? Right. So what's the trouble? -[woman] More, more ledgers. -Stella's passed out upstairs. Isabelle's in the kitchen cooking. -Ooh. -I don't know where Rachel is, but I'm sure she's headed here. And this one, with that computer of hers, has probably already planned outthe cost of my funeral! And you ask what's the trouble? How about if we go out -and look for the girl-- -No more girls! Not until you unzap the four actively pursuing my body. -[knocking on door] -Oh, great. That must be Joan. What do I do? Well, be glad that she's not after your body. But then again what's one more? -[grunts] -Uh... camel heads and camel humps...Uh, making the wise men a grump. Uh, I can't undo my mind-- Uh, at all time. -Oh, I don't know. -Dancee, do something!

Oh, memos, bills, sales. -Who's the naked girl? -Who? -And what is she doing? -[woman] I need more. The books. She's doing the books. Let's go outside, and I'll try to explain. [laughs] Oh, good luck, kiddo. Do you remember the bottle we unpacked the day before yesterday? I thought you were gonna tell meabout the nude girl in there -doing the books? -I am, but it started with the bottle.There was something inside it. -What? -[car horn honks] A genie. [car horn honks] -Bobby. -[chuckles] Bobby, darling. I missed you so much. Yeah. Dexter, how did he get out of there? -I don't know. -Tighter knots next time. -Oh, Bobby, darling. -Rachel Richards? Quick, Dexter. Get the stuff set up. For what? [indistinct chatter] Ms. Richards, so is this the lucky man? Yes. Bobby Delaney. Won't he make a wonderful groom? -Groom? -Groom?

Bye. -What is going on? -[chuckles] [reporter] Mr. Delaney, how does it feel to be -a chosen one? -Chosen one what? Chosen by Rachel Richards to be her lawfully wedded husband. [chuckles] Excuse me, but there's been a major mistake. Joan, won't you take care of everything? And who are you? So, who are you? His sister? No. I am not his sister. Bobby, you can't leave me out here like this. Don't you set foot into this shop. I know we should never have left him alone. Never again. [driver] Hey, you folks hear Rachel Richards -just got hitched? -Yes. We've heard. Uh, roses are red, violets are blue. -Oh, Bobby. Bobby. -What's the matter with her? Uh, Dancee, do something. Uh, prove that you're here. -Who are you talking to? -Dancee, the genie. -What do you want me to do? -I don't know. Something! Uh, tell her to watch the shelf. -Watch that shelf. -Why? [glass shattering] Dancee, my folks are gonna kill me! -How did you do that? -Oh, Bobby. Bobby, I love you. -Do something about her. -What do you want me to do? Not you. It's what I'm trying to tell you. Uh, the bottle, there's this genie. She's right here. She broke those vases. Well, she can't see me. -Shut up! -What? No. not you. Oh, God. I think I'm going crazy. Oh, you're not going crazy. You just-- You just need a little rest. Do something, Dancee. Do your genie shit. Bobby, more, more, more ledgers.More papers, more bills, Bobby. You relax and I'll see if I can find some upstairs. [Bobby] No! Oh, no! I'm ready for you, Bobby. Bobby, are you all right? Bobby, baby, I've been waiting so long for you. Stella, what are you doing here? She was just taking a little nap. Breakfast should be ready soon, darling. Goodness, guests? I better prepare more. -Who is she? -Who's that? -The cook. -Bobby, what is going on here? -Yeah. -Uh, nothing. Uh, figments, that's what they are. Figments of our imagination. [indistinct chatter] [woman] Oh, Bobby. Bobby. I love you, Bobby. -Oh! -Ow. What's your hurry? My hurry is that if I don't get out of here, I'm gonna get lynched, and it'll be your fault. I take responsibility for nothing. I do my best. That's all I can do. Well, you better do better, because if I get killed, you'll have to start all over with your gladiator boyfriend. Okay. I'll... -Are you this guy, Delaney? -Uh, no. I mean, I don't know. Uh, I never met him. Help me. Help me. Oh, no! [woman] Oh, Bobby, come back. Bobby. -[gunshots] -Oh. Help! I want my genie! [gunshot] Oh, I think I have it. I think I have it! Bobby, Bobby, I need more ledgers, more sales print. I think I've got it. I think I've got it. Well, say it or do it now! What do you want us to say or do? Yeah. What do you want from us?A ménage a trois? The answer to this confusion is in the heart. The unzapping and eliminating of these tarts. It's not nice to keep your master waiting. Don't stop. Oh, I love that outfit. [Bobby] Dancee... -Who are these females? -[Bobby] Uh, friends. Friends of the family. A wiggle and a shake, uh, a jiggle and a roar... One more for breakfast. Bobby, these are all girls. What is the meaning of this? [all] Yeah. Uh... And release these false loves and let true love soar. [all] Well... [Louie] Isabelle! Try again, Dancee. Try again! [glass shattering] Watch out! [gunshot] -Is anybody hurt? -Not yet. -Yeah. -Yeah? You mealy-mouthed pussies, get out of here. I'm not going anywhere without my boyfriend! [grunts] You can't talk to me that way, woman. And he's not your boyfriend. He's my fiancé. He's not your anything. He's my slave. Oh, get out of here! [grunting] Bobby, please do something. They're your friends. Think, Dancee. Think. Ooh. I am thinking, Master. Ooh, but I love a good cat fight. Get them, girls. Oh, scratch her eyes out. -[indistinct chatter] -Oh, yes, yes. Me, me, me, me. I've been a naughty boy. Oh, give it to me. Hit me, please. Oh, yes, yes. Hurt me. Hurt me. Oh, God. Calm your waitress. [indistinct chatter] Oh, hurt me. Abuse me. Oh, yes. [screaming and grunting continues] You bitch! Let go of me, you bitch! Let go of me! Get out of here! [screaming] Go sit on my face. Leap on it. Leap on my face, baby. [screaming and grunting] -Where are you, Isabelle?-[woman] More, more, more, more. [screaming and grunting] Wow. What a body. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Master, I can't seemto connect with anything. Dancee, didn't you remember something yesterday? -What was it? -Oh, yeah. True love. Real love will break the spell. Isabelle! Isabelle. Isabelle. The genie. Give me my genie. Are you Delaney? -Shit! -Asshole! [groans] Hey. Hey. [screams] [groaning] Here. Oh, have you seen... [Bobby's mom gasps] Tell Bobby I need more papers, more ledgers. More, more. [indistinct chatter] Oh, my God! Isabelle! [indistinct chatter] What is the meaning of this? Bobby, what is going on? [indistinct chatter] I got it! Let's see. When the heart expresses what is truly feels there is no need for wishes and deals. If in my master's life true love exists, let him find it waiting in the morning mist, and eliminate false loves not true today, and allow the real love to find the way. Well? Bobby, what happened? Why did they all stop? I'm really sorry about all this, Joan. Was it the genie? -Dexter, what am I doing here? -Uh, you're gonna marry him. Ha! Marry this nerd? You've got to be kidding. Rachel Richards would never lower herself -that low. -Ow! -Come on. Let me hear your pain.-[Dexter screams] I thought the guy I threw out the window was Delaney. I don't know. What happened? You was in here cooking and cleaning for that... That little weasel. Never would I be unfaithful to you, Louie, especially not for that sad excuse of a man. Ow! [groans] What the fuck is going on? Did you get me drunk or something, Bobby? No, Stella. [sobbing] Take advantage of an innocent little girl. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you pervert. -[thud] -[groans] You have embarrassed us, Bobby. There will be no second home in The Hamptons for us, you, you-- Whoever you are! [groans] Bobby, this is-- This is terrible. -[sobs] -See what you've done? I think you better go for a while and let your mother calm down, and me too. Dad, it was all just a big misunderstanding. And when you get back, I expect you to clean up this entire mess. Yes, Dad. -Is she here now? -Yeah. Joan, this is Dancee. Dancee, this is Joan. -Hi, Dancee. -Hi, honey. She says hi. You know, I'm really sorry about this. Yeah. Don't be sorry, Dancee. [Joan] Why is she sorry? [Bobby] My last wish was to find love. That's why all those girls were after me. Only Dancee couldn't remember how to unzap them all. -[Joan] But she did. -[Bobby] Yeah. -It's a beautiful poem. -What did it say? That true love will find its way. And that's why the spell was broken on all those girls, because true love was there, right there in that room. Me? Congratulations, honey. Dancee. Dancee, don't leave. [Joan] Where is she going? Away. I have so much to thank you for. So thank me. Thanks, Dancee. You tell her thanks for me too. She hears you. Good luck to you both. And smile. You have your whole life ahead of you. She wants us to smile. That's better. [Bobby] She's gone. I'm sorry. There's no need to be sorry. Dancee, wouldn't want it that way. We got to celebrate.Party. Tell the world about us. -[wind howling] -The bottle. The bottle. Finally, the bottle. Come to me. Come to me. Come to me, genie. Come to me. Come to me. Come to me. [wind howling] Have a nice 2,000 years, Foley. [Foley] Help! Help! Help! Bye-bye. Look out, New York. Dancee is coming through.
