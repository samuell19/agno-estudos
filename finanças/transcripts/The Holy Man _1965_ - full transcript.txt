The Holy Man Birinchi Maharaj is great! Birinchi Maharaj is great! Where are you from? We are returning from Banaras. - Oh!, Kashi!! - Yes. Haven't been there in a long time. Your work was in Kashi... Too crowded. That is true. But still... I had said at the very start itself, you have created a great city, but will it remain like it is? So many storms will blow over it, so many will come and go... One day, Sankar came to me and said, "Even if you don't follow the philosophy of 'One God,' "don't you agree that Gautam caused a lot of destruction? "Don't you think some action should be taken for this?" I said, "If you want to, then take action. "If that's what will get you peace of mind, then do it. "But remember one thing. "Someone someday will mess up your work as well. "Someone will play football with your religion. Understand that well." That lad had something in him, but he could not master the science of life. That's why, at the age of 32... Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up. I don't have a moment of peace. I have to awaken this lad every day from his sleep. - Baba. - What happened? My mind is at unrest, Baba. What is your name? My name is Gurupada Mitter. Advocate. Come here, child. Touch his feet. Sit. This is my younger daughter, Baba. Her name is Buchki... I mean, Neelima. Her mother died last year. Since then, Baba, there has been no peace. I've visited Kashi and Vrindavan, but still I cannot find the strength to go on. - Cannot find the strength? - No, Baba. It's as if there's no pillar left for support. Hold this! Hold it! Hold it tight. What? Is there any unrest left? Is there? Is there any sadness left? Do you feel the spirit? Any emptiness left? Any restrictions left? It's fate. Oh, God! What happened? Nitai da? If only I could find a good Babaji, I'd leave everything and go with him. Why? You've lost interest in the world? - Mind is at unrest, brother. - Check. Life has sped by. At home, the wife keeps complaining. At the office, there's a new boss. He is also... It's all rubbish! Nothing feels good. - If you know of any such man, let me know. - There's no Babaji in your fate, Nitai da. Your constant chatter has made me lose my knight. You know, in spiritual matters, talking less is a primary condition. This young man is an insurance agent. And to top it off, he can do Hatha Yoga. So, why can't I find myself a Babaji? My case is intellectual. You will not understand that. It can only be understood by Paramadha Chatterjee. Are you in the habit of chewing green chillies? Oh, Nitai da! Yes? A sage has come to Jagannath Ghat. Understand? He's called Mirchai Baba. People visiting him are being offered enchanted green chillies, and after eating them, all their illness is cured. Will a Radio Baba work? Swami Taritananda! This Baba has two "tives". One negative, one positive. Drains electricity from the sky and sparks it to people. Really? You go to him and you will be cured of all disease. Electrotherapy! My disease is just one, lack of money. Let him find a nice source of income for me and I'll accept that he's great! That too, he can do. - He can? - Yes. He will take you to a place for a day, before the battle, in 1914. Then? You will buy some iron. Iron? Yes. Cheap. Then? - Then? - Cheap... After that, you... Check. After that, what? After 1914 what happened? Mate in two moves, brother. What happened after 1914? After 1914, he brings you back to '65. - With the iron? - Yes, of course. And then you sell the iron at the current rate. Current rate? Current rate! Nibaran da! - What? - Disaster! Sit. ...three hundred, 400, 500, 600, 700 rupees... Speak thee not! I have done it, brother. I've done it! Narendrapur, five acres of land, three houses, now all I need to do is find the Babaji. - Again Babaji? - Chess is an intellectual game. This kind of pandemonium does not go with it. He's destroyed everything. Buchki is getting an induction. - What? - Buchki is getting inducted into priesthood. Some Babaji has inducted her father and now the daughter will also get it. - Did you go to their place? - Yes, that's where I'm coming from. So is this good news or bad news? Getting inducted into priesthood is good news? Why not? I too will get inducted if I find a good sage. - Oh, God! But I was to propose to her! - So you propose... No, Nitai da, you do not know the background to this story and so you don't understand the reason for Satya's anxiety. You need a little introduction. This Buchki is Alipore lawyer Gurupada Mitter's younger daughter. Mr Mitter's wife, Soudamini, was Takdar Shashi Ghosh's daughter. - Is that so? - Yes. She died a year or two ago. I see. I know them through my childhood friend from Bagbazar, the famous Professor Nani. Nani's wife is Mr Mitter's eldest daughter, Nirupama. Fine. It was in Nirupama's house that Master Satya first met Lady Buchki. It was love at first sight, and since then, he's contemplating marriage. Oh, I see. - Clear? - Clear. So the point is, Master Satya has fallen in love with Lady Buchki, but Lady Buchki wants to get inducted into priesthood. Hence, the matter is very serious. Exactly. Satya, carry on. Fatik, get some tea. They returned from Kashi yesterday. I would have visited them yesterday itself but at the laundry, my bloody pants were not ready so I had to wait for a day. So then, today, at around 8:00 in the morning, I went to their place. On reaching it, I noticed that the place seemed strange. The guards were all huddled together and talking. The usual Radio Ceylon was not playing. Everything seemed different. Anyway, I entered the house and was going up the stairs when someone called me from behind. I turned and who do I see? Ganesh Mama! Wait a minute! Who is Ganesh Mama? Ganesh Mama is Mr Mitter's brother-in-law. Lady Buchki's uncle. Clear? Clear. And then... Buchki is not there? She is. But there is work going on upstairs. Buchki's father is getting inducted into priesthood. Priesthood? Why should the word "priesthood" make you smile like that? Do you know his guru is a great and learned man? He's been around since the time the town of Kashi was constructed. - Which Kashi? - Kashi Banaras. Not kashi... Oh, God! Is he into black magic of some sort? No, he's not into black magic but he's a capitalist, for sure. You are a hard-core communist. Now move along. Communist? Yes. I've heard you go out on protest marches on the roads. Oh, that... No, no, you'd better leave today. Come some other day to meet them. Oh, your son-in-law is well, I hope? Has he got a job? He was looking for one, wasn't he? Okay, then. - Hey! Listen, listen, listen... - You called me from behind? Do you know of any job or what? I do know of something but he must be trying elsewhere, I'm sure. No, no. Nowadays nothing can happen without a little backing. But Uncle, in case of backing, what of his self-respect... You cannot understand, Satyaranjan. Today's day and age is different, isn't it? You go up and meet everyone quickly. Then come and give me the details. - Yes, then, I'll quickly... - Yes, quickly. You wait. I'll take just five minutes or so. Hey, Buchki. - Are you calling me? - What's the matter? What is this induction and all about? Your house has completely changed. - I'm also getting inducted. - Buchki... - Didn't you get my letter? - Your letter? - I wrote to you in Banaras. - Was that you? A seven-line letter! Of that, two lines were from Shelley, two lines from Chandidas and two lines of Shesher Kobita. Other than that, all it said was, "How are you? I'm fine!" But believe me, the feeling behind it all is mine. - Keep your feelings to yourself. - Listen... - I have work. - I need to talk. We'll see after I'm inducted. Then? Then what? I left the place. Nibaran da, you have to help me. You deliver quotations instead of love letters, and I must rescue you. No, I can handle that part of it. You just remove this Babaji. What if this person is genuine? So, you think he is genuine, Parak? Me, Brother, I have an open mind. If he appeals to your intelligence, that's great. Otherwise, reject him. Could we meet and interview this Babaji? - Does he sit at any place? - I don't know. Satya, did you see Buchki's sister? Was she there? Yes. She was. Then one... How old is this Babaji? 2,000? Oh God! Paramadha, sell him an insurance policy. You will get many premiums. Hello? Is that Potli? Is your father there? No? Mother there? Put your mother on. Say Nibaran kaku is calling. He was talking about the days when Kashi was born, right? Maybe he was talking about rebirth. After all, there have been reports of jatiswars. Is that Boudi? Fine. Where is your husband? Experimenting again? Boiling grass? Why, can't Nani digest raw grass any more? Here, protein synthesis is taking place. The grass will get hydrolysed and turn into carbohydrate. Then, if you leave two amino groups, you get hexahydroxidiamino. - What is this rubber pipe? - Oh, yes. Potli, play that once, my girl. - Only bubbles? - It's getting oxidized! Do come. The tea is getting cold. I thought music would flow down the rubber pipe, mix with the grass and create a fantastic green nectar. If I get successful with this, I think lack of... - Lack of food? - Yes. - There will be no lack? - That's right. Boudi. Start practising how to chew. Understood? Sure. What everybody does, I shall too. What's the matter in that? Please sit. - Well, I haven't asked you one thing, Nani. - Yes? Will future humans walk on two legs or four? The advantage of four legs is... - Speed? - ...speed. Two plus two. Boudi, tell me about this Baba! - Who are you talking about? Birinchi Baba? - Is that his name? Potli! Keep a lookout on the grass. I am doing so, mother. Come. Tell me. What can all this be? I went home and saw that my father was getting inducted. Since my mother died, my father has changed. Stopped working. Doesn't meet anyone. I thought that father's mind has... Anyway, now he has got GuruвЂњ. - Guruji is everything. - I guess so. So you are saying that this person has kind of settled here. Something like a semi-permanent settlement. Earlier father was not at all interested in religion. Something like what would happen if you fall in love at an old age. Well, Boudi, what is your view? What do you make of it? He speaks pretty well. Sounds good. Though I don't follow all he says. Some relevity, felevity... Relativity. Yes, that. Nani, you went too? Why him? Lawyer, barrister, Marwari, tarwari... So many people have been coming to hear him. Leonardo da Vinci. The man knows it all. - Really? - Yes. He used to practise austerities in Czechoslovakia. - Who? This Babaji? - Yes. Einstein used to visit him. - Visit him? - Yes. - He only taught him. - What? Relativity. E=mc2. Baba taught him? Taught Einstein? Is that what he said in front of so many people? Yes. And people believed him? Everybody clapped. Even you would have done the same. Okay, Boudi, you tell me, how long does a person live? Why not ask the person who knows all this. Nani... You tell me, how long can a person live? Quite long, actually. How long? 150? 200? If it's 200, then it's a tortoise. Not man? Not a homo sapien. And 2,000? 1,000? 2,000. Could any man be alive since the construction of Kashi? The tea is getting cold, why don't you drink it? What happened? Can he? His right-hand person seems like a loafer. What, Nani? - Trees can. - Not homo sapiens. Tree. Bo tree? Buddha's tree of enlightenment. Remember? You are a scientist. He said all this nonsense about Einstein in front of you and you didn't expose him? And you're laughing. What's the use, my friend? In the end, he'll accuse me of causing trouble because I'm after his property. - But it's interesting. - What? He showed us something. Come forward. I'll tell you. This is the present. - Where? - Here. At this contact point. And this right hand is rotating clockwise. Future. - All right. - And this... Anticlockwise. Anticlockwise, the past... He made both of them move at the same time. - At the same time? - At the same time. - In opposite directions? - In opposite directions. So he says that there is nothing like the present because time does not stop. Difficult. Boudi, can you do it? Try it. Let me try. Yes, try, try, try. If he can't do it, how will I be able to do it! No. - Listen. - To what? The voice of the Babaji. Time is a very strange thing. Time is a very strange thing. It is said people are here today but not there tomorrow. I say, you're there tomorrow but not here today. Tomorrow. This means time. Tomorrow is there, but today, the present, does not exist. How can it exist, eh? How can it exist? Time is constantly moving. It does not stay in one place. So how can you label it as the present, tie chains around its leg and hold it and after holding it, say, "Look here, this is the present"? The moment it stops happening, it becomes "happened." Or "Has happened." Or "Had happened." All this means, the past, something that has gone... The past. The past. The past. The past. The past. - The past. - The past. On this, I had verbal arguments with Plato. Who is he talking about? - Plato, the great Roman astrologer. - Astrologer! Plato said, "Inhuman logas cognosis." I cannot understand what you are saying. I cannot understand what you are saying. "Dictos jargon paranois." You are talking gibberish. I said, "Well, fine then, if you cannot understand, "if you cannot understand what I'm saying, "then I'll do a demonstration for you." Plato said, "Oh my God, what demonstration!" He was quite scared of me. I said, "Why are you getting scared, Plato?" It's very simple. Look at this. This is my right hand. This, my finger. Now, this starts rotating on the right side, clockwise, meaning, in the direction where time goes. And where does time go? Towards the future. And, this is my left hand. This rotates on the left side, anticlockwise, signifying the past, what has already happened. The past. And now, they rotate together. Front and back. This is life. What was there... What will happen, will happen. Past and future, the world lies between these two. Outside, outside! Come, come, come. Come and sit. Sit at the back there, understood? At the back. Don't worry so much. We'll go and sit. After all, we must disinfect our minds, which are so filled with sins. Come, come. Please come. Quickly, go and finish the blessing part. Who? Me? Yes, not another word. Go ahead. My Lord! Who is it? It's me. You look familiar. Where have I seen you before? Me? - In Nepal? Have I seen you in Nepal? - I stay on Serpentine Lane. Name? What's your name? What's your name? Satyaranjan Sarkar. Satyaranjan. Satyaranjan. Satyaranjan. Satyaranjan. Yes! Murshidabad! I remember now. In Jagath Seth's house. It was his mother's death ceremony that day. There were many people. Raja Krishnachandra, Rai Rayan Jankiprasad, Nawab Iftikhar Salar Khan Khanan Mohabbat Jung... Amir Chand of Sutanati, the one mentioned in History as Umichand. Sethji treated us to a lot of food. But the sweets ran out while serving the Lords of Sutanati. while serving the Lords of Sutanati. So, they abused the host and left. Incredible! This is the perfect time to go up to him. He's in the right mood. Shall I go? Anyway... So, Motiram... Motiram? I knew you by that name only, child. You were Sethji's accountant. So Motiram, you'd better chant the "Dhurjati" mantra. Every morning, wake up and chant it 108 times. Dhurjati, dhurjati, dhurjati, dhurjati... Very fast, all right? Now go. Lord, what is better, the path of urge or that of satisfaction? Fine question. Fine, fine. Tulsi once asked me the same question. Tulsidas! We eat food, don't we? Yes, yes. - But why do we eat? - Why do we eat? Because we feel hungry. Because we feel hungry, what do we eat? Rice, fruit, fish, meat. Fish, meat. - What happens when we eat? - What happens? - Our hunger is satisfied. - It's satisfied. And so, the root cause of consumption is urge, and the result of consumption is satisfaction. Isn't that so? Yes, yes. Yes. So... Tulsi was a sage. I told him without consumption there is no satisfaction. I said, "Oh, Tulsi, "if there is no consumption how can there be satisfaction?" So after he finished Ramayan, I made him King Mansingha Told him to consume as much as he wanted to. He earned a lot of wealth but nothing remained with him. He married the daughter of that Bengali Jagatsingha and blew it all away. Excuse me... Bankim didn't write that in his book. - Excuse... - My Lord! - Lord, find a solution for me. - What do you want? Take me to 1914 for seven days, Baba. I will buy some cheap iron, Baba. Please, Baba. Iron? Yes. Iron, sir. I mean, Lord. Cheap? Yes, Lord. From 1914. - What do you do? - I am the ledger keeper in an office. Total salary is just 233 rupees per month. I can't manage my family with that, Baba. - Can't manage your family? - No. The iron, My Lord! Wealth does not come so cheap, my man. Does not, does not. Does not! Very strict meditation is required. From the Muladhara Chakra, you must control KulaKundali, the source of power. Then you'll have to raise it to the Sahasrar Lotus. This Sahasrar is the sun. That sun has to move backwards. You must make it move backwards. If you do not understand the science behind the sun, you can't do it. Cannot! Cannot! Cannot! And that is a matter of huge expenditure. Huge expenditure. Then? Then, sir... Sorry, Lord! - Then what? - Then is there no solution? Please, Lord, find some solution for me. There is a solution. - There is a solution. A solution is there. - There is? Right at noon, when the clock strikes 12:00, go to the terrace. On the terrace, look at the sun, and then chant 108 times, "Martanda, martanda, martanda, martanda, martanda..." Martanda, martanda, martanda, martanda. But your eyes should not blink. Your tongue should not get dry. Then... Om temporal Om temporal O Mores! Om nific! Om niscience! Om nibus! Om nivorous! Om! Buchki... - This man, he's... - What? ...great! But just postpone your induction for a few days. Please. Thanks for your suggestion. Don't worry. I'm there. I'll fix everything. Come on now. Doesn't work. This Baba is a fraud. What? Has your faith disappeared? It's all rubbish! No trace of poison, only empty threats. If you have so much power, then show a miracle or two. That he will not do. All he does is talk about what he did in the Satta era. Who can do even that these days, Nitai da? Stare at the afternoon sun and chant a mantra. You can't even bat your eyelashes. You try it and show me. Let me see whether you blink or not. Is this some kind of a joke? That's where you went wrong. If he did it himself, he would reduce the voltage of the sun. After all, I hear he moves the moon and the sun. Nibaran, if you want to expose that Baba, then I'm with you. Babaji's new get-up, magician. How? - I just saw Brahma. - You saw Brahma? Sit. - What do you mean you saw Brahma? - I went over to their place, Nibaran da. Why? I thought I'll meet Buchki and fix up something. What? I knew I wouldn't be able to meet her so I took her a letter. - Another quotation? - No, no, no, a poem. - My, my! - And what did you write? I wrote, "Babaji's a fraud, but my love..." - Can you go, Nitai da? - Just continue. I wrote, "Babaji's a fraud, but my love for you isn't fraudulent. "If you opt for induction, why then should I stay alive?" That's it. Two lines. Couplet. Fine. So did you give her the letter? Kind of. You see, Babaji goes into a trance at 7:00, and then everybody leaves. So I thought if I go there at 8:00, I might get to meet her. But still to be on the safe side, I took the letter along with me. So, I reached there at exactly 8:00. The house was silent except for the striking of the clock. I was feeling a little nervous, but still I entered inside. After climbing half the stairs, I felt as if there was no one upstairs. Difficult! After mustering up such courage, would I have to return home hopeless? No. I must give it one last try. I thought I should check the backyard and garden of the house. As I walked, I heard some strange sounds emanating from there. Hey, Buchki. Buchki... Brahmo, Brahma, Brahmayi... Long live the Lord! And then? And then, the climax! The climax? So soon? While going to college, she dropped this in the mailbox. What has she written, brother? "I know and understand everything, but I have no option. "I will be free if the Babaji leaves." Oh, so she understands, after all? Why wouldn't she? Whose beloved is she, after all? So why are you so excited, Satya? Remove this obstacle and she is mine. Understood. Is removing him so easy, Satya? It's not that easy. Nibaran da, you're giving up? Just think, Satya, the man has some talent. He is the greatest obstacle to my romance and you are saying... He is a high-class actor. He understands mass psychology. He's educated. Has an amazing memory. He has imagination. Has presence of mind. Has guts. What more do you want? Oh, Lord! But you can argue, he does not have honesty. But today, many great people lack that quality. There goes my hope. - But... - But? - He... - He? ...has to be exposed. Hear, hear! - Because... - Because? If he is not exposed, they will also not be exposed. They? Who? All those who are going and falling at his feet, encouraging him, letting him grow. You've just increased the scope of our work, Nibaran da. What is needed is one... - Double exposure! - Yes. - One stone. - Two birds. Get going, Nibaran da. - But... - Now, what's this "but"? How? How? How? Will I have to die chanting "How, how", Nibaran da? Paramadha, you're into planning policies and things. Why don't you come up with something good? You shouldn't have let the salt sprinkle on your open wounds. Instead, if you'd have picked a policy then you would have... - Anyway, forget it! - Forget it. I've got it. Why are you laughing? My God! Where there's smoke, there's... - Satya! - Yes. Are you on good terms with the servants in that house? I tipped the guard that day for tying a Rakhi on my hand. - Solid two rupees. - Good. This tipping is... Parak? You people, I believe, have very beneficial policies these days. Why? Thinking of one... What is all this suspense for, brother? Hello? Who? Nani? Did you eat grass? What? Listen. My room has been invaded by mice. What can I use to fill up the room with plenty of smoke? Nitric acid and copper? Oh. Tri-nitro-di... Oh, no, no. I don't need red and blue coloured smoke, brother. Just simple white smog to fill the room... What is Boudi saying? What? Wet straw? Splendid! Splendid! Nani, that Nobel Prize will finally be bagged by Boudi. And you... Bonny prince? Bonny prince. Atta... Attaboy. Attaboy. Cos... Cosmos. Cosmos. - Whist-ling wind. - What? What wind? - Whist-ling. - Whistling wind, whistling. Whistling. It's getting a little dull, uncle. Let's take a break. Now relax. Paradise has two first-class movies playing. You're still not steady on your legs. This bloody Nataraj's gesture is very difficult. While you danced the dance of destruction Oh, Nataraj, the god of dances Your tresses had fallen down - Who is it? - It's me. Gurupada. Wait. I think I've disturbed your time of rest. What have I done to deserve any rest? I came because I've been feeling a little anxious. Anxious about what? I mean, you haven't complained, but are you facing any kind of difficulty? Oh, is that all! Yes, I mean, your food is okay, I hope. Look, Gurupada, you're doing everything you can. And I don't want you to do anything that you can't. And talking of food, would I ask you for a hippopotamus roast? I would not. Because I know that it is impossible for you to get it. If that be the case... It's very tasty. You know the time that you term as the Stone Age? During that time, I ate quite a bit. These days you will not get it. If you want something like... Ganesh... Some other land animal might have been simpler, but we'll find a hippopotamus. New Market stocks everything these days. Then just find out. Yes, yes. Don't worry. It shouldn't be a problem. And... I hope you are not facing any problem. Please do not embarrass me by asking such questions. I am no one. Nothing. Very lean, very small, very insignificant. My own happiness doesn't count. Gurudev's happiness is my happiness. His peace is my peace. His satisfaction is mine. I found this person at a fruit market in Babylon. - Nebhu was then only a child. - I was then just a child. Then was he also... I was standing at the watermelon shop buying watermelon, when I felt someone tugging at the end of my robe. Tugging. Even then, I saw humility in his eyes. And since then, he has been with me. Amazing! Then again, he is of the Asirio race. In his earlier birth, he was a scorpion. That's why, he's a little... Okay then, I will take your leave. If there's anything you need... - I'll tell you, I'll tell you. - We'll definitely tell you. Okay then. - Grandfather... - What? The food of the house has become stale. One day give us some first-class mutton biryani. Rubbish! Mutton biryani! People are getting anxious to watch some Gods. Now it's Mahadev, right? - Yes, yes. This time it's Mahadev. - I've already announced it. Yes, this time it's Mahadev. Next moonless night it's Vishnu, then Jesus, then Buddha, then Hanuman. Why don't you make a long list and hang it on the main door? I will. But the crowds are getting unmanageable. The room is small. Call the people by rotation. One thing, grandfather, no young lads. Remember that day you told some boy that you saw him at Murshidabad? - Who? Satya? - Yes. He is an idiot! Harmless! Why increase the tension, grandfather? No young people, except the females. Middle-aged people, people your age, but not the sly ones. Either people with faith or an eye weakness. Besides that, no admission. You keep quiet. Age is not the main factor. - Yes, the main factor is... - Exactly. If only I could go out, I would have tried playing treble top. Okay, what about letting the Batparia enter? The one who said he'd make us a three-storied hermitage? Yes. With cooling system and lift! Yes. Why not? You will also have two rooms in that. Yes. Don't forget my 10%. Does anyone forget their cousin, brother? Have you ever heard of that? Hippopotamus roast! You are a bombastic person. At 7:00 sharp. Understood, Parak? But be careful. Even if you're half a minute early or late, everything will be spoiled. The first stroke of 7:00 must match your matchstick stroke. Understood? And what is Nitai da's function? Or will he only listen to authority? The first reaction to the smoke will be from him. You better watch the window carefully. - At the window? - Will you be able to act scared? Why act, my brother? You've seen my wife, right? All I need to do is think of her moon-like face. And then... - And what about me? - You? You think and figure it out yourself. One house, lots of people, and a fire breaks out. Panic! And in the ensuing confusion, the girl you want to marry is trapped. What will you do? - Rescue! - Good! - Should I propose at that moment? - You can. - But if she refuses? - Idiot! No means yes. Good night. Good night. Good evening. - Are you fine? - With your blessings, madam. What is the manifestation today? Vishnu? No sir. Shiva Nataraj. - Really? - I told you it was Mahadev. Yes. He who rotates earth. - Come, come, Bardhomanji. - How are you, Ganesh Babu? Fine, fine. What's this? - Date palm jaggery? - Yes, date palm jaggery. - Will I be able to see Shiva? - Yes, yes. Of course! If you won't get to see it, who will? You've given Babaji so much, haven't you? Of course, you will get to see. 10% of it. And, if you want, you will also get. Really? Is that so? - Yes, it is. - It is? - Sure, it is. - Come in, come. Go quickly and sit in the front or else there'll soon be a huge queue. Okay, okay. Thanks, sir. - How are you? - So you people have come. Come, come. Satya, people from your house have all come? Yes. We'll go in now. Satyabhushan, that interview letter did not come. It will come. Any day now. - Any day now? That type in... - Do not worry. I am there. Right, right. You're there. And listen, you go upstairs and sit. Don't sit too much in front. Sit a little at the back. Babaji does not believe in the present, you know. The present generation is also... Not there. Non-existent. Only past and future. Right? Everybody wants money and wealth. Everybody wants money and wealth. Isn't that so? But it has to fall in the right hands. The hand has to be the right one. Got it? If it falls in the wrong hands, it can cause calamity. And that is what leads to confusion. Actually, wealth is not important. What is important is the hand on which it lands. This is the reason for all fights. This is the reason for all arguments. With whom, do you know? Jesus. Jesus! Baba! Baba. Baba. Baba. Jesus said, "Wealthy people can never reach heaven." I said, "Why not?" "One just has to use one's money for good. "One just has to use one's money for good." That day... That day, I told him a few nasty words. Later there was regret. Regret. Poor lad. Poor lad lost his life. Poor lad. - Lost his life. - Poor lad. - Lost his life. - Poor lad. Excuse me, Lord. - Who is it? - Excuse me. Come closer. Allow him to come. He has something to ask. Come. Come. Lord, I... Seeing you, I am reminded of Manu. Who? Manu Chatterjee? Manu Swayambhu. Sharachi. Goutami. Damash. Bairath. Chakhush. Sabarno. Dakhya Saborno. Brahma Saborno. Dharma Saborno. Rudra Saborno. Rouchya. Bhoutya. Shayambhu. He comes and tells me, "I have written the Samhita. Please look at it." So I said, "Let me see. Let's see what you've written." One lakh slokas! Oh, my God! Who will read so much? Who has the time for it? Cut it. Cut it. Cut it. 300. I selected 300 slokas for him. I said, "Keep these, they will come in handy." The rest, he threw away. - Excuse me... - I'll tell you about one more Manu. It was the Age of White Pigs. Right after the time of the Great Destruction! One day, the Creator, the Creator came and told me, "I've created humans but where will they stand? What will they eat?" Everywhere, there was only water. Seeing the state of the earth, the Creator got scared. Seeing his fear, I felt pity for him. I said, "Don't feel scared. I am here. "The science of the sun is in the clasp of my hand." I increased the power of the sun. All the water dried up. The earth filled up with forest and trees. Lord, did you know Jesus Christ? People say crucifixion. I say crucifact, because I have seen it all with my own eyes. My God! And Gautama Buddha? Gautam? That Gautam? Gautam was just a young lad of yesterday. I knew the Buddha when he was a young lad. Om temporal O Mores! Om nific! Om niscience! Om nibus! Om nivorous! Om! Don't go. Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Hello? Hello? Fire brigade? Fire brigade? Leave me. What are you doing, sir? Leave me. There's a fire. Leave me. Why, don't you know the science behind the fire? Lord? Now leave, Babaji! No more in this locality. - What are you doing? - Rescue. - Where are you going? - Hold still. Can I ask you something? This is not a quotation. My original words. Shall I? What? Will you marry me? Oh, my God! Really? Uncle! Uncle! Let's go. Well, you're not so silly after all! Towards the future. Let's go. Let's go. THE END
