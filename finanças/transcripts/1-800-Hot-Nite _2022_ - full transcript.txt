Don't hang up please. - What? - I just, my friends think you look like your picture. - I do, I look exactly like that. - Oh really, yeah, that's cool. - I gotta go. - Tonight's my last night. - Hmm, what does that mean? - I just, there's this girl that, I like her, I've liked her for a couple grades now. And I want to ask you for some advice, 'cause I don't know what to do. - Why are you telling me, go tell her? - Well, my friend likes her too, and I don't know if she likes me or anything. - You know what? Your friend doesn't own her. So if you don't tell her, then she'll never know. People don't know things unless you tell 'em, and you don't know if someone likes you until you kiss 'em. You know how to kiss a girl? - Yeah. - So go do what you wanna do, 'cause there's a whole world gonna make you do shit you don't wanna do.

You look so funny. -What are you doing? - I told you his clothes smell like ass. - Are you sure this is her house? - Wash your fucking clothes, bro. - Where do we go? - Go to the right. - Right here? - Yeah. What do you mean? Do you not know your right and left? Damn. Come on. Dude hurry up, walk. What ya'll doing taking so long. Yeah, come on. - Shh, sorry, sorry. My fault, bro my fault. - Yeah. - Hey. - Shit! - Come on man, again? - What? - You know what, get down here. - Shit, all right. - Oh shit. - So what, you guys like walk here or something? - Yeah, yeah, we walked. - Did y'all like plan these outfit or something? - No. - Oh yes, that's little Steve. - It's just Steve. And I'm actually average type. - Keep telling yourself that. - Hey, Maya. - Hey, Tommy. - Mr. Boyd made me run the students door register once you left, and I lost five bucks from the till, so he fired me. - He's so anal about that, but it's whatever. I have like a week and then I can go back and fix whatever you messed up. - Wait, like a week until you're done with the? - Chemo. - Yeah, yeah, chemo, yeah. - Yeah. - Sarah was telling me at school, so. - Yeah. - Tommy, what's with those stupid ass clothes, man? - Oh nah. - Okay, so we just snuck out tonight to call this phone sex number. - What? - What? - Yeah, what's that? - It's just like a number you call, and then we found this payphone, right? - I, found it like a week ago. - Yeah, and then this chick just talks dirty to you, you could say anything you want about sex and stuff. - Shh, my dad. - Try to keep it down, man. - So that's when we saw you guys at the hot tub, and then Dave called the cops. - Wait, he actually called the cops? - Yes. - Damn. - I mean we thought he did. And then the cops showed up to Tommy's place, and then they arrested his dad. - Steve! - What, it's crazy. So like we run from the cops, and then we went to Steak Burger. And the reason we're wearing O'Neill's stinky ass clothes is because someone stole our laundry, and we saw the guy. - Shh. - Shh. - And we saw the guy that stole my Cap jersey, he punched the shit outta O'Neill. - Wait, you got hit? - Man, whatever all right, it wasn't even like that. - Yeah, you probably deserved it. - He did, and then we went to go get a motel room. - Oh yeah, and we used the dog lady, that lady. - The lady, that's always out by her car? - Yeah, and then she went crazy. So the motel after that would only take cash, right? So then Tommy had to collect money from his paper route. And then these guys, these big, buff guys pulled him into their apartment. - They put me into their apartment, took my money and shit. - Man, that's not what happened. Tell them what happened, dude, it's funny. - Stop it. - He peed his pants. - Ewe Tommy, what the fuck? - Wait, you actually pissed yourself? - Gross. - No, I didn't, it wasn't like that, look. - Oh shit, that's my dad. You guys gotta get in the pool, go. Get in the pool, get in the pool. - Shit. - Fuck. - Hi, dad. - Hey, Mr.. - I'm going to bed, honey. - Night. - That was just my dad, he's going to bed. - Should we stay in the pool? - No stupid, get out of the pool. - Hey, is your dad gonna hear us? - No, he sleeps with this like tornado sound thingy, so he doesn't really hear anything. - Okay. - I mean it's still warm. Don't be doing that. - You're so stupid. -That's what I've been saying. - You little dumb ass. - Dumb ass. - Can I touch it? It's smooth. - Yeah, no shit. - Hey , why you always talking shit? - Shut up Steve, don't you got a home? - No, that's why I'm stuck with his little ass. - It looks good on you. - Marco. - Polo. - Marco. -Polo. - Marco. -Polo. - Marco. -Polo. - Marco. - Polo. - Marco. - Polo. - Polo. - Marco. - Polo. Yes. - It's the shallow water. - So! - Marco. - Hey, don't open your eyes. - I didn't you fucking narc. - You did open your eyes. - Fuck off. Marco. - Polo - Marco. - Polo. - Hey, player. - But that isn't like the only reason why, you know, my brother went off to college and then he got really depressed. So that's why we're going on this vacation, which I guess is good. You know, I was gonna surprise him with all his old Pokemon cards he used to play with when he was a kid. - I used to play Pokemon cards too all the time. See, I thought Charizard was the shit, I had like this special edition card and. You don't even know what I'm talking about, do you? - What, okay, I know Pokemon. I was the one that beat my brother. - Oh. - Hm-hmm. Yeah, I was obsessed with Mewtwo. - Okay, I see you. See, I don't even think I have mine anymore. - Damn, I was gonna say you could bring some over sometime. - Oh, then I'll find those quick. - Ah, okay. So, what now? - I don't know. Actually, I don't know. - Yeah, we could play Marco polo again. - Could we play it for three days straight? - And just get all shriveled up and eat in the pool? - Exactly. - Where you gonna sleep? - See, I don't even need to sleep. - Sure. - I'm gonna bounce. - Right now? - Why? - 'Cause. - Don't go yet. - Come on man, what you doing. Way to kill a party man. - Yeah O'Neill, what about Tommy? - You can't stay here. - What, just 'cause he can't go home? - You don't have to say it like that. - Steve, let's go. - I'll tell you when you can kiss me. - Damn. - Yeah. - Okay, bye Tommy. - Okay, bye Britt.

Steve, let's go. - Man, why'd you do that? - We can go or you can go to fucking foster care too. - Fuck! Fuck! - You've called 1-800-Hot-Nite . I'm so horny, and I've been waiting for you. What took you so long? Is someone there? - It's me, don't hang up, please. I have the card number. - Kid. - No, no, no, take it, take it. I have it, it's 4500-1234-56- - Stop, stop, stop. Breathe okay. Tell me your name again. - Tommy. They took him, 'cause of the drugs or whatever. They took him. - Wait, what took who, Tommy? - My dad, the cops arrested him, and messed up. They took my little brother, I ran with my friends and we tried to get money. And I went into an apartment and these guys made me scared, I peed myself. I fucking peed all over myself, and I kissed her. The girl, Britt, I kissed her. - Okay, Tommy, I hear you . I hear you, okay. Just breathe a second and tell me what happened. - Nah, I am telling you. I'm telling you, they beat me up, they just started punching me. Just wanted them, and Steve didn't do nothing stop it. Now it was O'Neill, he hit me. And I can't get the motel room! - Tommy. - What? - I need you to tell me where you're at. I look just like that, right? - No. - So I'm Ava, you're Tommy. So like you live around here, Tommy? - Yeah, kind of, just back down Fourth Plain, that way. - So what, like you wanna go back there or what? - I can't. - What do you mean you can't? - 'Cause they're gonna take me away. I told you that, I said they're gonna take me. - Okay, okay, shit. - I'm gonna go to foster care like Isaiah. - Who's Isaiah? - He's my stepbrother, but he's little. Like he doesn't even know what's happening, I don't care, I'll run anyway, you know, I'll run. - It don't work like that, not like you think it does, little man. You gotta have people even if you run. - Man whatever, why'd you even come here anyway? - You were the one calling me tonight anyway. - Can I try that? - No. - So your friend busted you up, huh? - Yeah well, he gets into fights all the time, so I had no chance. - But you kissed the girl? It was good, right? - That your boyfriend? - He's like the only guy I could talk into, like driving me all the way the hell over here. Like, I don't do this shit. Anyway his name's Biggie. I guess 'cause he's big, but it's better than one of those names with the guy is big, but they call him like Tiny or whatever, like people supposed to laugh and some shit. Come on. - Where? - Man, you wanna run away, don't you? Then get in the truck, we're gonna break into your house. - All right, you gotta turn left up here. - Yo, get down, down. - Are the cops at my house? - Yes, yes. - Stay down. - Why are they still here? - Yo, yo he's coming? - Oh yeah, he's good, he's coming. - All right, go get your stuff. - All right. - Tommy. - What are you doing? - Hey listen, we're just looking around, it's not- - Don't, don't touch that, no! - Get off me. - Don't push him. - Sit down! - I said don't. - Tommy. - No, don't touch me! Get outta my house, get the fuck outta my house now. No, that's my dad's. That's my dad's and he's he's coming back, okay. - I know. - He's coming back, you can't take that. - Wait, I'll tell him to put it back okay. Yo, put it back. I said fucking put it back. - Tommy. - Oh shit. - No! No! - Hey, Tommy, Tommy stop! Tommy! - Ava come on. Get in the fucking car! - Tommy no, you'll get electrocuted. Tommy! Tommy stop, Tommy don't, don't! - Get off me, get off! - Stop moving, I'm not gonna hurt you! - Let go! - Stop! - They're going to take me! - Okay, so what? What? What do you want me to do? - I don't know, I don't know. I don't know where my dad is. - I know, okay. - No, you don't know. - I do know, I know. - No, I don't want them to take me. - Okay, so run then, run! Really though, you go and run and run, but you'll be hungry, and I'm not talking about wanting a sandwich or something. 'Cause you'll eat, but you'll still be hungry. It don't go away, it just comes with running. And you'll take things from people because you'll have to, and you'll think it's good, and you'll think this is my family. But it's a bad trade because they want things back in return, not like a parent. Then when you're done given everything, you just wish you could go back, and fight, and rewind, and do anything instead of run. - I don't care. - Yeah, you do, you care about shit. You've been crying. - I'm not crying. - Cry, like whatever, just keep caring. That's what good people do, they care about shit. And you just run out here and grab the tower, like what do you do, you kill yourself and then what? - Can I try that? - No, I said no. You know, I think like we can only be one thing at a time, I think. Like, you can be a sister, I mean, you can't be a sister, but be like, a brother, or dad, work at a bank or, do phone sex. That's like all we get, is to be good at that one thing, just that one thing. - I don't know what my thing is. - Me and you, we have to figure it out way too early. Most people don't know till they're like 30 or 40, or like Ray Kroc, he was like 50 something. You know who that is? - No. - How old you think I am? - 25. - Good. - All right, how old do you think I am? - 12, 13, 11? - 12, what? - I don't know, you're a kid, like stay a kid. If there's any kid left in you, hold on to it. Listen like, you don't have to go with them. Like, we can run, and you're a runaway. Or I can walk with you over there. - Just one thing? - I think so. - I have a brother. - Okay. - What are you doing kid? You're not under arrest. You are pretty quick though, I'll give you do that. - Hey, where are you taking him? - Who are you? - I'm his friend. - We're gonna ride with the officer, okay? He's gonna bring us to my office okay. - All right. - Hey, I said, where are you taking him? - How do you know him? - I already said that, like I'm his friend. Like I live here, like just over there. - You okay? - Tommy, you call me, okay? - Does he have your number, or you want me to write it down for him? - He knows my number. - Tommy, Tommy, Tommy! - Tommy I'm sorry. - Why don't you take a seat right over there? - There's Officer Riden. - Tommy!
