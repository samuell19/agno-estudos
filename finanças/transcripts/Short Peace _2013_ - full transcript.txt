Can I come out? Not yet! Can I come out? Can I come out? Now you can! What is this? Can I go? Now you can! Alright, I'll go. Mei, where are you? Mei? Entrance Mei? Since the 18th century, it is customary in Japan to give offerings to the gods of death, it's also known as "paying your death tax". The "Ying and Yang" are opposite elemental forces, they can be used either to hinder the lives of people or to benefit them. "Possessions" (九十九 Tsukumo) I lost my way during this awful storm. Please allow me to stay here just for tonight. What is this? Ouch... Ahcha, Gahcha, are you comfortable here? Ahcha, Gahcha, make yourself at home. My umbrella is broken. Ahcha, Gahcha, it's broken and pretty useless. Ahcha, Gahcha, we'll have to toss it to the trash. Ahcha, Gahcha, straight to the trash. Wow, such rare umbrellas we got here. But all of them are broken. Huh? Ahcha, Gahcha, Ahcha, Gahcha. I gotta go. Gotta go! Gotta go! They are very pretty, aren't they? They are gorgeous. Pretty and very colorful... But... People don't take care of them as they used to do. They have tossed us away. Hey...? Am I still pretty? All of these are very beautiful. That's too bad that they are worn out, but it doesn't matter. I'm going to fix them good. They look pretty good now. I'm just a wanderer that has been traveling through this forest. I got stranded because of the storm. I entered your shrine to seek shelter without your permission. Please forgive me. Would you let me go unharmed? What a hideous smell. I can finally leave this place. Otherwise, I will end up just like them. Nonetheless... I will never forget the kindness and help that they provided me tonight. I'm grateful for every spirit that inhabits this shrine. "For your earnest effort" "Combustible" (火要鎮 Hi no Yōjin) Japan Edo Era (1603-1868) A catastrophic incident destroyed more than half the city. Koume, are you still busy? I'm sorry, little lady, I'll play with you later. Owaka! Matsuki! Seiyoh, Seiyoh, Seiyoh. Chah! Chah! Chah! Let's have dinner? Owaka! Matsuki! I think I lost the game. I'll go see. Mr. Sada! Mr. Sada Kichiro? Yes!? Where's that smell coming from? Can you go see where it's coming from? Alright, I'm on my way. Just around the side of the monastery, the wind is blowing westbound, there's nothing to worry about. Mr. Matsuki? He's the neighbor's youngest son. Matsuki and his friend Kaji are so handsome. Where did Matsuki go!? I told you so many times that I demand strict vigilance. Look all around town! I bet he's hanging out with Kaji Ran again? Kaji always knows where he goes. They found a wealthy suitor for her, did you hear? Darling, where did you hear that? Ms. Narita told me, she looked pretty happy. Nobody knows the name of the groom yet. Wakana, dear, why don't you introduce yourself? I'm Wakana at your service. She has good intentions and works hard. But she's still getting used to rules and customs of a proper bride. Owaka! Matsuki! You idiot! You sneak seven or eight times even if I keep catching you. You aren't going to shame this household any longer with your behavior. This is the last time, Matsukichi! Nobody will show you your errors if you always keep your eyes closed. Leave and don't return! Owaka. Matsukichi. What's wrong? My dad has just disowned me. How come? Matsuki, you're his only heir! It doesn't matter. I never wanted to inherit his household anyway. So, that's it, he's the sole owner now. Matsukichi, you had to follow his orders to keep living with him. What am I going to do now? How am I going to see you if you won't live here anymore? Don't worry, I will come see you anyway. Matsukichi. Have you forgotten something? What's that? The promise we made when we were children. Childhood promise? Yes, from that time. There are three days left. She has to decide now before the wedding. She need to talk to the relatives and consider what they think of it too. They make it sound so easy. Matsukichi. A fire! Damn it! Hurry and go! Get out of the way! Move! Move! Matsuki, how are things at your end? My dad has evacuated the family already. Make sure there are no more survivors left behind. Your house is engulfed in flames! Understood! Her house is gone! I need to find Owaka. All is lost on this side. Evacuating people by the west end is just too risky. Direct the survivors to the opposite end! The fire hasn't reached that part yet. There are still plenty of survivors! We will save as many as possible! Owaka? Knock down these stilts supporting the house! What are you doing!? Owaka! Owaka! Matsukichi! Matsukichi! Damn it! Watch out! That's no good! That's the signal! Owaka! Stop going that way! Owaka! Alright, heave-ho! Pull with everything you've got, you bastards! Get away from there now! Matsukichi! Everyone in the village knows about you. A legendary fearful monster. Come on, monster, kill me! Buddha Amitabdha... Is this pleat enough for you. Town Chief, does this looks alright to you? Don't worry about it, this is God's will. Everything is going as it should! You may say it, but... Buddha will have compassion towards us in the end. Don't worry about it. The ogre will have the young girl as offering and won't attack us. We won't be able to kill him with our rifles anyway. Help me please! This village keep losing their strong men. Our time is running out fast, old soldier. That Devil, could it be the ghost of a great white bear? That's not it, this is a fire red ogre that's about 13 ft. tall. Another monster... I'm not asking you to chase him away, I'm asking you to kill it. Every night, a first-born daughter is kidnapped and taken away for his pleasure. He has the town engulfed in total chaos. Right now we have only the daughter of the emperor here. The last one to offer to him in sacrifice. There's no helping it. All the human warriors tried to fight him and lost. KEN! Please Mr. Samurai, hear us. We trust that you would be able to help us out and slay the monster. A bear! Don't eat me! Don't! A devil arrived. Help me. Please. Gambo? You understand my words. Don't go alone, it's too dangerous! He's more like a guardian god. Kill me, I beg of you. And kill them. These are the spawns of that demon. Before birthing these monsters. Please kill me and don't let them live! Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him! Somebody, stop it! You are pretty naive, young girl. If you are looking to save yourself. You'll have to trust in our power till the end. But...! If you put faith in us, we'll be able to slay the demon! Demon begone! Shoot! Gambo! Thank you! What the...!? Answer at once! What did you do to control the creature to help you? Perhaps because I never lost hope in him. This is the best team that they can deploy! Jin was the MVP at the time, almost like a superstar. Yeah, we did a damn good job at the time. Nobody sustained a single injury. That was almost 30 years ago if I recall correctly. Was it you the one that did it? Yeah, that mission was a damn good success. I had a lot of fun with these guys. I hope we make it out of this one alive. Yes, it's gonna be a long day of work. Afterwards, let go for sandwich and to play some basketball. Yeah, eating so close to the reactor is not cool at all.

The king of skies is back home! The camera! Next time you deploy it, let me take a look at it. - Sure! - Sure! Junkey, good job! No problem. How long until we're there? In about five more minutes. We'll be launching the first UFV soon enough. I got it. I got it right! You guys are going to fry yourselves inside those protection suits. They include air conditioning inside. You idiot. You gotta have a positive attitude. We're ready! Why aren't you more careful, you idiot! I didn't think you were going to stop so fast! That's not important now. Are you alright? Come on, dude. I'm sorry, bro. You gotta watch out next time! Alright, it's time to go. Avoid going through the tunnel, it's collapsing. Search for objectives in less than a 1650 ft. radius. Search for objectives in less than a 1650 ft. radius. Rum, don't be afraid. Marl, watch where you step and be careful. Yes. Lieutenant, are you okay? Calm down, Marl just stepped over an old mine. Come on, don't waste time. Don't be so loud and bossy. I can't breath! Lieutenant, be careful, please. The radar is detecting some movement. Alright, it's loud and clear. Everyone listen! There's an underground weapon facility west of here. We will take on the weapons of the hangar. We'll prepare a ground assault. Be ready, no matter what we have to confront. While the UFV was informing us of the situation... The enemy already started to move. Move out! Hey Marl! Aim for that white building on your right. Gimlet, understood. Come on, go! The trace is aligned! Perfect, alright! Jin here. I still can't find a decent spot for a sniping point. Rum here. I'm in my sniping point, the coast is clear! I'm good! Rum, what are you doing? Fix the settings after you settle it down. Junkey, what are the data regarding this zone? The enemy is advancing east. You will be able to see it through the UAV. Did they deploy the Hellfire? "It's on" Good, wait for more instructions. Marl, how are things there? Marl here. I'm climbing the stairs to reach the 3rd floor. Copy that. Jin, inform me from your position. "Last street point". I'm in position to open fire at any time. Continue the operation. Junkey, answer me. Junkey, here. Let Hellfire drop its load. Understood, Hellfire is going directly to the objective. Hey, Junkey... Just now... I saw it. That was a GONK, wasn't it? Everyone, Gimlet here... The explosion didn't affect it. Approach the enemy with extreme caution. I have it locked right in front of me. I can see it too. I have positions too. Marl, don't get cocky over there. Marl here. Understood. I see it already. It's coming! Marking the point with the laser marker. What are you doing!? Marl, are you alright? I marked it with the laser. I wonder how the hell he always completes the task. Marl "life check, all green" he's good. Marl do a "system check" I already did it. It's "all green" too. The battle has finally started. Alright, I'll be the first attacker. That's good. Impact will happen in four seconds. Three... two... One! Rum here. Taking enemy fire. I'm going down and get my position. Alright. Bastard! Marl here. Launching the second missile. Now, I'll get you. Impact will happen in... Four... three... two... one... Rum, are you okay? Moving to the next position. RUM! FORCED DISCHARGE! Don't move! Rum! Rum! Calm down, I'm still alive. Glad to hear that. Jin, when I open fire, I need you to cover me, understood? Gimlet! Jin, I'm counting on you. Understood. Very good! Come on, Jin, hurry up a little more! Jin, how are the preparations for the extraction going? It's not ready yet. Damn it! Junkey! Junkey here. 2nd set of Hellfire missiles ready. We aren't letting you go! Understood Gimlet. Fire it! Alright! Junkey, can you see it? Yes. Neutralize it now. Launching Hellfire. It has begun! You damn asshole! How's this!? You son of a bitch! We're still here! Rum, shoot it down now! Shut up! Verifying if GONK was successfully neutralized. Everyone, it was a job well done. What did I tell you, huh!? That sucks, it went underground. Yeah, we're all very glad for that. Now it comes the critical point of the operation. Good night, you are in the Tokyo road now. Tell me something I don't know already. Keep us informed, Junkey. We will split here to start the search. Rum and Marl, search the east wing. No problem. We will go by the west wing. Understood. Marl, don't you have that remote controlled car to search for it? Use it to let us know about your findings. Yes, sure. Will it be better if we split too? Yeah, Jin is new and I'm not sure if he'll feel comfortable searching underground. Yeah, good luck with that, Mr. big boss. Hey brother, when I was shooting, I figured I could destroyed it even if you haven't helped me. But of course I wasn't going to leave a comrade behind. You idiot, only a civilian would think like that. The mission is always priority. Marl here. We have pinpointed its position. It left a strong trail down here, I wonder if it's still moving. Marl here. Entering the TL as we speak. Well done, start the access, we'll start the operation soon. Junkey can you give me an update of the situation? Junkey? Can you hear me, Junkey? Answer me, Gimlet calling. Marl, answer my call, this is Gimlet! Marl, can you hear to me? There's not enough signal coverage with Junkey. I'll try to establish contact for a ground search party immediately. A ground search party? Hey Marl! Your little car is out of range? It seems today is not a lucky day. Jin. I can't find anything here. Junkey is not answering, I have a bad feeling, let's go back to ground level! Rum! It's your fault, I can't move! Get down! The GONK is still operational! Gimlet! Get down and wait for my orders. Marl, are you okay? Rum is frozen, launching smoke bombs. Wait Marl! You can't use the "discharge" here... Rum! Damn It! Gimlet! Where is Rum!? We may have lost him! Gilmlet, The UFV of Junkey is showing up! Junkey!? Junkey, are you still alive!? Junkey! Here is Jin. I'm going to flank it from behind. Use the electromagnetic grenades. Understood. Me and Marl will carry the offensive move. Activate the timing at a three-count detonation. When the electric shockwave hits, attack it. Marl, you'll destroy the TL. We will use a missile... ...this is the only chance we will have. That's your mission and you're responsible for its success! Alright let's go, one, two, three! Marl! What's wrong Marl! Marl, are you still around!? Wait, I don't feel well... The TL is out of service for the time being! If it turns on when the booster is blocked, it will activate and explode! Yes. Alright Jin, this is the time to destroy it, it's offline. But it won't be for much longer. Marl here. I finally entered inside the TL. As soon as I reach the booster I'll let you know. Marl, hurry up! As soon as you start it, it will explode. Gimlet, I destroyed its system and its fire weapons. I can see here that it's recovering pretty fast. I'm sorry I can't be of more help but I have my hands tied here! Marl here. The fuel is pretty low, but I'll try to activate the boosters. I'm outta here! Alright! Be careful! Come on, Gimlet, the GONK is almost ready to reboot again. I'm sorry, GONK, but you will be buried under the rubble here! Marl! JIN! Marl, run away! Jin! Jin, run away! Jin! Captain Gimlet... How about you? Can you move? Don't panic, activate the "escape" device. Yes, the "escape" device! Marl! Hey Marl! Hey... Are you alright? Captain! Be more careful next time. Menace to human population neutralized. Civilian servant mode activated. GONK AT here. Data in the tracking system and laser defense operational. Returning to base for general maintenance. You asshole! Damn you! Wait, don't run away! Hostile threat: negative. Subject identified as a non-combatant civilian. What!? You are trespassing into a confined combat zone. Civilian, please evacuate the premises as soon as possible. You bastard! Your acts of violence are irrational. Please read this brochure. You will understand that wars aren't reasonable. That pamphlet will give you more information about it. Are you joking me, you bastard!
