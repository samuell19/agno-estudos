[music playing] Draftswoman. Bristol. Um. I'm afraid I can't remember how I heard about it. My mother told me about the course. I'm a housewife and a mother, and I live in Croydon. Right. 1, 2, 3, go! I'm a mom, and I've been a dinner lady for 15 years. But now, I'm working at an outdoor center in Bolton, only in the office, of course. It's my first, proper job. They've paid for me. It's show I know what I'm talking about. My mother's paid for me. I thought it was an unusual holiday for us both. I'm, um-- a businesswoman. I have an antique shop in Hampshire. I can't swim. Just sit down and drop off. It won't reach your waist there. I'm headmistress of a girl's school in Brighton. I'm here for an adventure. It's no good. It's the thought of my head going under. Your head won't go under, I've told you. [laugh] Graphic designer, London. I feel sick on down escalators. You're never gonna get me up a rock face. OK, last two. Can't we just walk on the water, instead? ANN: Up you go, come on. Come on, Fran. Just relax. Jesus me. It's all right. I've got you, I've got you. ANN: Up you go. That's it. Slowly. I'm a doctor. I work in family planning and for the pregnancy advisory service. I read about it in "The Guardian" on the women's page. Look, I think this is a wonderful opportunity for women, but I really don't think we should be put in a situation where we're competing with groups of men. ANN: There aren't any groups of men around here. It'll be just a few instructors, maintaining equipment. Terrific. FRAN: Shame. [laugh] You're looking lovely. [groaning] I'm the wife of the headmaster of a proprietary school. I have three sons, aged 17, 15, and 14. The chief emotion I feel towards all four of them is resentment. I'm here because I want time to think. My son said I was mad to come. He said you'd all be a load of butch dykes. [laugh] Overhanging branch. Overhanging branch. Boulder on the right. Boulder on the right. Boulder on the right. (SINGING) We don't want to join the Army. We don't want to go to war. We'd rather hang around, Piccadilly underground, living off the earnings of a high-born lady. A high-born [inaudible]. Bye. See you later. Bye. Has she gone? Don't be daft. FRAN: No. They wouldn't do that to us on our first night. Cooey! Come out, come out, wherever you are. Right. Let's choose a team leader. I am not getting involved in any male hierarchy nonsense. (SINGING) We know what you're doing. We know what you're doing. Has anyone got a torch? Anyone got a compass? Anyone been a girl guide? Yeah, me. Not one of them's really fit. First women's course in the country, and I think she's made it too hard for them. And doesn't understand what ordinary women are like. Under the tree. Under the tree. Under the tree. Tree. There's a stone here. There is a stone here. [chuckle] Oops. Mommy. Yes, darling? You said this was gonna be fun. Naked man in the bush. Naked man in the bush? Really, Francis. Flasher to your left. They'll be back soon. Nothing much can happen to eight women tied together. Oh! [splashing] Yuck. And now, hut 2, 3, 4. Hut 2, 3, 4. Hut 2, 3, 4. Hut 2, 3, 4. Hut 2, 3, 4. Hut 2, 3, 4. Hut 2, 3, 4. I want a divorce! Oh, we're only having a shower together. Do get your own. You'll be a sitting fuck? I am that already. (SINGING) He's just my Bill, an ordinary guy-- FRAN: Me, I'm a closet celibate. Well, no, no, no, I'm a non-practicing celibate. I'm only celibate when I'm not out of it. [laugh] Friends like lovers. He'll screw around and screw you up. Listen, watch out for young men who [inaudible]. [laugh] No, no, because they can't afford their share of the bills. It's true. (SINGING) It's surely not his brain that makes me thrill. God preserve me from feminist men. Oh, and the ones who mow their lawns too often on Sunday. Oh, no. And ex-public school boys. Oh, no. No, no. And Jews. Oy vey. [inaudible] No, because they all suffer from it. What? Guilt without sex. They go dipping their little ding dongs all over the place, always have, always will. No, girls, listen to this. No, listen. No, do you know what I reckon? I reckon we'd be a lot better off if the boys unscrewed their ding dongs, and put them in-- [LAUGH --and put them in little glass jars in the fridge. Children? My dear, don't you recognize a good old fashioned spinster when you see one? One minute, she wants a divorce, the next, she's changed her mind. Ian's a very good husband and father. I've told her to wait until the babies are older. I wish I were a lesbian. Half my problems would be solved. FRAN: You are out of bounds! Oh, god. [cough] [yawn] All right, girls? Yes. OK. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. (SINGING) Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily-- (SINGING BADLY) Merrily, merrily, we-- [thud] Oh! [laugh] [bad singing continues] You're too far ahead. Stop mucking about. Wait till I get back with the others. FRAN: OK. (SINGING) Row, row, row the boat, gently down the stream. Fran! Fran. What? Ann says stop mucking about and wait for the others. [scream] Help! Fran. She can't swim. She can't swim. It's all right. [whistle] [splash] [screaming] Don't worry. The lifeboats will keep you up. Hold onto me. Hold onto me. We're gonna swim. I can't swim. It's all right. Almost. I'm all right. What the hell happened? Oh, never mind. Get your canoes and paddles, and go again, OK? You're not gonna make us carry on. And quick, before the tide turns. Are we going home now? Sheet of polythene, piece of string, and you're out for the night. Here, I'll lend you me sweater. [thunder rolling] Anti-depressants? Brewers yeast and ginseng. I've been like a magnet for you since the start of the course, haven't I? I want to tell you all about me and my life. [thunderclap] [music playing] [crash] Jesus! [shouting] [gasping] Oh, shit. [laughing] [birds chirping] I've always been frightened of being alone. I wasn't at all last night. It was a real luxury just lying there, listening to the woods. Did you have any deep and meaning thoughts? I did. She's nearly 9. I was 30. I owned my own flat. Could afford a nanny. I wanted a baby, so I had one. That was very brave of you. Does he see her often? He's American. He's back there now. Doesn't know a thing about her. I timed it. I did not want paternity complications. Do you ever get the feeling that real life is happening somewhere else, and that you're so busy just getting on with day-to-day existence, you don't have time to live it? You are? Yes. I keep thinking, if I could just get it all organized, get things under control, I'd be able to-- What? I don't know. Does your husband still desire you? [chuckle] Well, yeah. Doesn't yours? No. He thinks I'm oversexed. Emotions are an intellectual malfunction to William. You what? You'll soon get used to the idea that men are fairly transient creatures in our lives. My affairs tend to be passionate and short-lived. I see. I'm a serial monogamist. A what? It means one at a time, one after the other, and they don't last. [laugh] Do try not to be late, darling. [silently mocking] That's why I keep thinking a divorce might help. I'd have more room. Up here. Still, my mother's organized, and she's not doing it. Doing what? I don't know. Living the other life. I was trying to write to John about it last night. Dear John, there's something I've been trying to tell you. I love you. I love our home. I enjoy my job. But I keep feeling there's another me who should be living another life somewhere else." He wants me to have a baby. If I don't make me mind up soon, it'll be too late. [laughing] [chuckle] I'd be a North American Indian. A Squaw? No, bit of both, actually. I'd roam the plains with my tribe. And I'd have a big brown brave every night and lots of lovely brown babies. And I'd, uh-- I'd go bareback galloping and buffalo-hunting. That's me. DOREEN: I think Racquel Welch has been there before you. John's the only man I ever slept with, you know. He's 12 years older than me. Do you cum with strangers? Sometimes. Do you? Well, I-- I suppose I pretend sometimes. That is awful. - No, it's not. - It is. It's not. I mean, look, they try so hard to make you cum, and they get upset if you don't. Anyway, I believe in my old school motto, which is, if at first you don't succeed, cheat. [laugh] Look. Look, you've got to show them how. Oh, oh, yes, yes. Uh-- right on down a bit, yes. Move over. Yeah, to the left. Do me a favor. You're quite right. They only get irritated and tell you you take too long. I know. But have you have noticed the voice change? No, really, no. The voices change, they do, and it happens so quickly. I mean, at first, it's all, (HUSKY VOICE) oh, yeah, oh. Yes, your breasts are so beautiful, yes. And your skin is so soft. And then immediately afterwards, in a matter of minutes, the voice goes back to normal, and they're discussing the pattern on the curtains and what they're gonna be doing tomorrow. It's called seduction, love. It's called PCC, love. What? Post-coital contempt. You know, and you can't wait to get rid of them in the morning. Or worse still, when they can't wait to get rid of you. I find this talk disgusting. Have you no respect for men or-- or yourselves? I think you hate men. [clears throat] Morning, ladies. Morning. Sleep well? I really admire you, Fran. Admire me? Yeah. I didn't even like you at first. I thought you were vulgar and cynical. I'd like to be like that. Oh, no, you've got me wrong. Of all the women here, I'm the most likely to give up. Why? Because I don't care enough. No, if the going gets too tough, I'll just give up and go home. No. I do know myself. [grunting] Come on, you sissy. What are you hanging about down there for? JOAN: Oh, god, oh, god. Ann! JOAN: Oh, god, oh, god. Come on, Joan. Commit yourself. [crying] ANITA: Fran! Fran! What? You haven't moved for ages. I know. I can't. I'm stuck. I can't move. [scream] You all right, Doreen? I-- I-- I think so. Take it. Well done. I did it. I did it. Sh-- should we try a harder route next time? [laugh] FRAN: Anita! Yes? Lean over so I can see you. ANITA: I am leaning over. [scream] All right, Doreen. How are your fingers? OK. FRAN: Rope below! I'll be back. [crying] Anita, have you got me tight? ANITA: Yes. Right. I'm coming up. ANITA: Good. About time. Come on, Fran. Keep going. It's like going upstairs. Come on. I've got you. Come on. It's all right. Come on, almost there. You're almost there. Climbing. ANITA: OK. You did it. You did it. All right. Go on, get up there. I am trying, young man. Lucy, if you don't move, I shall bite you. I can't wait. [growling] Oh. [crying] Come on. Come on. Come on. I can't do it. I'm too old and fat. Shh. It doesn't matter. It does. I want to do it. You hurt yourself. No. Just scraped me knees and me hands a bit, that's all. But I've lost me nerve. Look, I'll have you on lock all the time. I won't do it. Yes, you will. ALL (SINGING): We'll never let you go. Why? Because we love you, love you. We'll never let you go. Why? Because we love you, love you. No broken limbs for us 'cause we love each other, other, other. Come on, now, Doreen. ALL (SINGING): I love you, and you love me. Oh, my darling, can't you see? We'll never let you go-- [cheering] How much further? About three miles. What happened to the land rover? It's busy. My feet hurt. Stop complaining. [splashing] I'd be a grand old lady traveller, going on endless expeditions across the Himalayas. Alone? With only 45 natives to carry your luggage. [chuckle] Well, I'd live in the country. And I'd collect antiques. And I'd have four children. And I'd keep horses and peacocks. And I'd be married to a vet. What happened to the ardent feminist? She's lonely. And she doesn't get enough sex. She lives with her female child in a flat in Camden Town. She works very hard. She's committed to what she's doing, enabling women to control their biological destinies. I've certainly controlled mine. Do you know, the last time I slept with someone, I didn't put my cap in, and I'd only met him that night. Do you want another child? No. I-- I just think I'd like to give fate a chance to intervene somewhere along the way. Look, I'm 39. I haven't had a relationship that's lasted more than a few weeks in the past five years. And I know that I shall probably spend the rest of my life without a man. It's just that sex is such a big deal. It happens so rarely. And I miss it. [crying] I miss having somebody to hold me night after night. And one-offs only make it worse. They only remind you of what you're missing. Sometimes, when you've made love with a woman for the first time, you know that it's kind of to make it the last. Go on. You know that she wants more than you're offering. It's funny, the more passionate she is in bed, the harder it seems to be for her afterwards. You know that she'll be on the phone with some excuse that she's lost her earring, or she's lost her hairbrush, but you know what she wants-- more. Don't you? Not always. I don't want to be made to feel responsible, and I know that's what she'll do. She'll make me feel responsible for her, and she'll make me feel guilty if I don't. Here. For the collection. Nail it to your bedpost. Look at them. Just look at them. Oh, Frances, your feet. I know. She borrowed her boots from a friend. You silly girl. You should break boots in. I know. Normal people take normal holidays. They lie on beaches in the sun, all day. Only one more day, and then it's the expedition. The final-- Two days in the wilderness. All the way up a 3,000-foot mountain, camp overnight, and then walk all the way back here. Yeah, 15 rotten miles. On our own, without Ann. Oh, do stop moaning, darling. I didn't bring you on this course for you to lie around on your bed all day, moaning. You old cow. Frances. Stop slacking. Go over to the house for lunch. Rope work at 2:30. What's rope work? Tying knots and ropes, silly. [giggle] [grunt] Get your bum up, Doreen. It is up! We should have safety nets under everything. Come on, Fran. One step, just on step. Great, Jude. You're halfway around now. Whee! [panting] I feel sick. [scream] Come on, Fran, have a go. Opposite hand and foot. It's easy. How do you know? You're not a real woman. Chicken. Oh, dear. ANN: All right, Lucy. [scream] Oh, it's me back. Me back. Don't move her. Keep her still. Thank you, Jude. I know what I'm doing, all right? Now keep still. Will you get some jackets, please, Susie? I'm just gonna move you, all right? How does that feel? Does that hurt? No, it's me back. It's me back. You're OK. Nothing's broken. Just rest there for a bit. Anita, run down to the center, will you? Ask them for a cup of tea. What's happening? Is she all right? Yeah, she's fine. Thanks, Lucy. You carry on with the course. Come on, Fran, one step, just one more step. Fran, breathe deep. Don't look down. Deep breaths, all right. Now think, think about where you're going to move next. It's opposite hand and foot, remember. OK. That's it. Move slowly. You're not gonna fall. Even if you do, I'm here to catch you. I'm right beneath you, OK? Come on. [scream] [laugh] OK? [stomping] What are you doing, Frances? Signing me postcards. How do we know if the patient is in a state of shock? Anyone? Fran. I'd check whether or not the patient's vital functions were seriously impaired. How's your vital functions, dear? [chuckle] You won't be laughing if you break your leg several thousand feet up on the mountain on Friday, will you? Can't you take anything seriously? Oh, naff off. Oh, Frances. [slam] Goodbye. I'm so sorry. It's me own fault. I should do yoga and go on walking tours like you. Bye, love. Bye bye. I'm gonna miss you. I'll miss you too. Bye. Bye. Oh, stop it. You're gonna start me up again. Bye. Bye, love. Good luck. Eh, come on. What? It's like hugging an ironing board. Thanks. I'll write you next week, find out how you got on. Will you? Bye. Bye. Bye. There are so many things I haven't done in my life just because I was scared. Come on, Jude, you can do it. ANN &amp; TOM: 1, 2, 3, go! [splash] [cheering] Bravo. Come on. Come on, I've got you. That's it. That's it. It's so cold. Look, if she doesn't want to do it, she doesn't want to do it. She's my daughter. You mind your own business. ANN: Come on, Catherine. You're next. 1, 2, 3, go! [splash] Well done. [cheering] Well done. Well done. See? Don't be such a baby. Oh, leave her alone. You are a bully. Look, even Catherine's done it. Go on, you can do it! [scream] [splash] [cheering] I've double-checked our list. We've got everything. You're being very efficient. I'm so nervous. I need to keep on the move. Are you frightened? Are you? What did Ann say about your feet? Just keep using the zinc plaster. How are you gonna manage? I'm not, am I? Go on. Yes. Lucy? Really? OK, girls, who's for a quick one before the big one tomorrow? [laugh] No, come on. Might be our last chance. Now if you were going with a man, tonight, which one would you choose? Evening. JOAN: Evening. [chuckle] But he was kneeling with my thighs over his shoulder. And he was grunting. Grunting. Like this-- [snort] Oh, Tom, I haven't embarrassed you. No, no, it's my run. - I'll go half with you. - OK. And same again, ladies? ALL: Yes. Do you know, I have never been in a pub without my husband. Have you? Oh, oh, I am sorry. He's dead. Heart attack, last year. Oh, god. I telephoned in. He sends his love. The children are well. I think they'd like to hear from you. Diane, I'm sorry about this afternoon and yesterday. I was just-- She was helping me out. You understand that, don't you, Mum? Yes. Do you fancy Tom? I think Jude's your competition. I want a man. I want a man tonight. Stop it. Stop it. [hiccup] I don't wear earrings. [laughs] Fran? What? I don't want to go. They're pushing us too hard. I've had enough. I'm frightened by the final. I want to go home. Oh, shut up. [clatter] [crying] What are you doing here? [crying] Come on, up you get. Time to climb a mountain. What are you doing there? Well, I got home. And I cried for two hours. I felt much better after that. So I decided to come back. Bill couldn't believe it. Don't tell me she's gone. You've got a knapsack to pack. Check the list with Anita. Three of you can share a tent. It'll give you one less to carry. Breakfast in 10 minutes. Where is she? She didn't. [giggle] [snort] Oh, I had a wonderful night. Good. ALL (SINGING): Heigh ho, heigh ho, it's off to work we go. With a shovel, and a pick, and a walking stick. Heigh ho, heigh ho, heigh ho. Heigh ho, heigh ho-- I asked him. [laugh] Oh, I feel wonderful. I feel completely different. I feel opened up. With John, I feel nothing very much. God. I didn't know what it could be like. Tom was-- Well, he's very fit. [laugh] I know. [kissing noises] It won't. They never do. Anyway, it's a toad. [laugh] How's your back? All right. How's your feet? Don't ask. We're such a pair of troopers. Soft-headed, more like. You're doing great. Don't you ever want to get married and have kids? Course I'd like to. I said to myself this year, well, the rate you're going, you'll probably never get married and have kids. Humph. I love this job. I never want to do anything else. [wind howling] Don't look down. What's that? It's mountain rescue equipment. FRAN: Looks like a coffin. [laughing] Whee! Woo! What do you think this is? A camping holiday in the south of France? I'm saving my dry clothes for tomorrow. Hm. Mine besides. [clatter] Oh! It's all right. It's all right. I'm all right. That's our supper. Oh. FRAN (SINGING): Is everybody happy? ALL: No. FRAN (SINGING): Anybody wanna go home? ALL: Yes. No, there's nothing here. Well, it's all right here. Where's it coming from then? There has to be a hole in the ground sheets. Oh, god. What are we gonna do now? Isn't it lovely? So quiet. So still. Oh, no. I'm You ready? Yes. [shivering] [laughing] Now I know you're mad. This is Ian's sweater. I really love him. I can feel it. I've been blaming him. Moaning about the kids. I've wanted to be looked after by him. I never really wanted to take on that world out there. I was frightened of it. But I'm not now. Oh, well, you can always go back to washing your socks, can't you? Get a nice part-time job, and everything will be hunky-dory. And then if you do get a bit down, you can take a little holiday with your mother, swing from a rope, climb a mountain or two, soon feel better. Frances. I do love him. I've hardly let him touch me since Ben was born. I want-- I really want-- Frances. I-- I've had sexual intercourse. Once. I was very young. So was he. Neither of us had done it before. We went to a hotel in Brighton for the weekend. He had a book with diagrams. It was awful. We left the next morning. I was so ashamed, I stole the bed sheet. I didn't want the chambermaid to see it. He didn't speak to me after that. He avoided me. A few weeks later, he got engaged to be married to someone else. And married her. It hasn't arisen with a man since. I still wouldn't know what to do. Lucy. Things haven't changed. It's when he matters that it hurts. You know, when he's touched something inside you. And I'm not-- I'm not talking about sex. It's like something inside you comes alive, and you start to need him. And if he doesn't ring, or he doesn't come round, then it hurts. LUCY: Can't you ring him? Nope. That's breaking the rules of the game. Tonight, I'm yours. And tomorrow, I might just be busy. So what do you do? I don't know. Keep hurting, I suppose. Sleep with other men. That doesn't help, actually. A piece of rubber stops babies growing, doesn't it? Not feelings. Fran. Why do you do it? I don't. I don't. I'm celibate. Well, I have been for three years. Why do we hurt each other so much? Oh, anyway, anyway, anywa. If they can't touch me, they can't hurt me, can they? [crying] I haven't been held for years. Tell me, as one celibate to another, how long do you intend to keep it up for? I think I'm like you. I've forgotten how to do it. [sniff] Mm, this is Tom's. [laugh] LUCY: It's dawn at last. Oh, god. It's the walk back. I'm not going. It's stupid. We're exhausted. We've been up all night. We've got no dry clothes, no food. Doreen and Joan aren't keen, you know. No. And I'm too old to go without my sleep. And I've just got my period. Certificates? What do you want certificates for? Look, it's-- Don't you ever give up? We're not going. Right. No, no, no. Please, girls. Look, there is life outside the mountain center, you know. We've all got jobs, and kids, and homes to go back to. Look, why do you think you came, huh? You came to push yourselves. To cripple ourselves, you mean. You came To push yourselves further than you've ever been before. We have pushed ourselves! Look, Ann, I can understand why you'd be disappointed if we didn't finish your course-- It's not for me. It's for yourselves. Look, why can't you understand you've pushed us too far. We're not going to do it. Um-- I am. I'm doing what I came here to do. FRAN: You-- Look, I know why you're not going. I mean, I have slept. See? And I'm leaving John. I know why I came now. Look, I've got to. Look, it's all right. I can go with them. Please. Look, you can all do it. Sorry, love. We've been mad. I just want you to know that I'm proud of you. Oh, dear. That still sounds-- last night in my tent, I was thinking about you. This week is the first time I've seen you as-- as a separate person from myself. I know you're not going. I respect your decision. All right. You ready to be off? Go to it, Mum. Joan, you're going with this lot. Oh. All right. Bye. Good luck. Good luck. Bye. Hey. Life isn't a rehearsal, you know. This is it. I came back to do this. I've got me pain killers. I'm going. You're joking. Anita, tell her she's-- And I am too. Oh, no. Look, come on, Frances. If I can, you can. Oh, shut up. You're not going back in the van. It's all right. I can use this. Fran, you have failed. Everyone else will have succeeded, and you'll have failed. - So what? Fran, love. Get off! You're scared. Scared? Listen-- Yeah? Climbing up rock faces is scaring. Swinging about in treetops is scaring. Leaping off bridges is scaring. Slogging miles across countryside with a knapsack on my back and 10 raw blisters where my toes used to be is boring! Oh. If you don't go, they can't. What? It's the rule. It has to be four in case of accident. Two to go for help, one to stay with the injured person, and no instructor. That's the other rule. Oh, you've done me, haven't you? Why? You can still say no. Look. Couldn't we go round this way? No, no, no. There are all those woods beyond there and no clear path. Could take forever to get back on course. No. It's up and over. (SINGING) Show me the way to go home. I'm tired and I want to go to bed. Oh, don't want to go up the top if we can go around. OK. Let's go this way. Hold on a minute, I really think we should-- No, come on. We may regret this. Wagons, roll! Right. (SINGING) This little blister went to market. This little blister stayed at home. This little blister had roast beef. This little blister-- LUCY: Oh, Doreen. I'll get you some water. Mother, where are you? She's here. There must be a crossing further down. Well done. You made it. We did it. [laughing] [singing "the can can"] Oh, no. Come on. [scream] [thud] Hold on! Hold on! Give me your hand! Lucy! Oh! We've had it. If you find them, they'll have failed. Won't they? Won't they? Yes. Our Fran was right. We should never have started. It doesn't mean I don't want to finish. Where the hell are we? It isn't fair. After all they've been through. Don't go, Ann. Look, it's the warden's orders. They're way overdue. We've got two hours to find them, then the police have to be informed. Another mountain center cock up makes the news. ANN: And I'll have done my first and last women's course. [humming "climb every mountain"] They're forming a search party. Yeah. It is! I was right! FRAN: You're sure? LUCY: I can see it. We can make it. We'll start here. Please, give them more time. Please. You can take the land rover. Oh, don't go, not yet. Don't you realize they could be completely lost out there. They won't be. Your daughter might be hurt. It's only pain. And they mustn't be rescued by a man, Ann. That's important. Look, we'll go. It's just a long walk. We're going. Tea! What and who is he? Were they like that before they came? Oh, no. [cheering] You bloody idiots. There's a pair in here somewhere. Oh. There. Thanks. Here. Thanks, Doreen. [laughing] Watch out! Watch out! What a bunch of maniacs. The other window. [splash] [groan] LUCY: Come along, Frances. I'm coming. [shouting] The door. The door. The door. Catherine, stay there. Push. I am pushing. Ow! [laugh] Push! [clatter] DOREEN: Bill! Oh! My Bill! Where's Fran? [music playing]
