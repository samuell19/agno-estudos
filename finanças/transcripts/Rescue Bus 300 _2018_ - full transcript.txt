The film is based on true testimonies from those who took part in the bus 300 hijacking on April 1984 What did you say? Will you marry me? Thank you. Sorry. I couldn't understand what he said. He proposed. He did? Are you sure? I think he asked if you want to marry him. Do you? I don't know. First I have to make sure that's what he really said. And then? Who knows? I'll probably say yes. I'm Esther. -Irit. Hi. -Hi. Bus number 300. This bus is like a recurring encounter, many people you've seen previously on this bus line but whom you don't really know. At the time, long before the Disengagement, many Arabs from Gaza worked in Israel, they worked in Tel Aviv's restaurants, construction sites, cleaned the streets. On Thursdays the bus was full of Arabs returning to Gaza for the weekend. Sometimes it was so crowded that it was unnerving. This time the bus wasn't full, but I was unaware. On the contrary, I liked that it wasn't crowded and I had other things on my mind. I buy one ticket, but we're actually two, me and the baby. Will Arik Sharon be able to surprise everyone again in the prime minister race? Shamir's cronies claim that... Driver, put some music on. Who cares about the Likud party convention? We accompanied one of them, Ruvi Rivlin, from Jerusalem. Ruvi Rivlin wants to run for the Knesset. That night, while watching the TV broadcast from the Knesset... Excuse me, I'm sorry. It's okay. You have a problem on the bus. Can you show me your ID, please? Take control of everyone! Not the children, not the children! Put the knife down! Step on it! You keep driving or I'll slaughter you! Listen, everyone, we have a bomb. If he presses the button, everything will explode! I was terrified, My life flashed before my eyes, I thought of the baby I was carrying. I didn't know if it was a boy or a girl. I couldn't believe that I was a hostage on a bus headed towards the unknown. No, I have no guess, I guess you're making a thriller film here. In 1981 I returned to Israel after 14 years abroad. And Rino Tzror from Hadashot Daily offered me a job. We worked like crazy and we were so enthusiastic. That night there was a Likud convention and I was there with Natan Zahavi. What crap. Then a journalist for Hadashot. These conventions are always "interesting." Listen to me... -Do I have a choice? Arik Sharon is gonna take over the party, just like his lackey, Uri Dan, said: If you don't want him as chief of staff, you'll get him as defense minister. If you don't want him as defense minister, you'll get him as prime minister. And that scumbag was right, that rhinoceros will be prime minister one day. Do you get a picture of him? -Uri Dan? Sharon. From all sides. Maybe that Amstaf will shake them up. How did this bunch of bums take the power from us, can you tell me that? Did you get Shamir sleeping? I did. He sleeps when he's awake, that loser. Did you get David Levy whispering to Katzav? I did, I did. Begin brought in two Sephardis as decorations. Tell me how a party where all the voters are Sephardi put only Ashkenazis on top? It was such a boring event. I'm taking pictures, hoping Shamir will go like this... You start imagining all kinds of frames, you need an amusing shot because it was so boring. We just sat there waiting for something to happen. I invite Minister Yaakov Meridor to the podium... Who's that? -Yaakov Meridor. Not another wiseguy... Remember his bogus idea of creating electricity with electric dust? Did you take his picture? -I did. Then what else is there to do here? I need one good picture of Moshe Arens. I was 22 at the time. I was studying at Tel Aviv University and, like every week, I was on my way home. Me and my boyfriend at the time, Ze'ev, at first I thought perhaps it was a robbery. I was 36, a teacher and student counselor, married with one child. I thought, okay, this is a terrorist attack and I saw a terrorist with an open briefcase with lots of wires and it was pretty scary. Pretty scary. I thought of pulling one of the wires but no, I'm liable to blow up the whole bus. Stop! I was just about to commence my service in the standing army. The first thing the terrorists told us was to draw the blinds. Everyone, close the blinds! Close the blinds. Close the blinds. Give us your guns and rifles! Another terrorist was holding a bottle with acid. Make sure no one has a weapon in the back. He stood by a soldier that was there. I have nothing on me. I think his name was Yochanan. And he started searching him for weapons. Close it. -Okay. I'm closing it. Keep driving, don't stop. Step on it. No one move! He had his finger on a device and I kept thinking that he looked so unprofessional, he could press it by accident and activate the bomb by mistake. Don't worry, he won't do anything. Don't worry. Everyone was in shock, no one uttered a word. The bus was totally silent. People were in shock. And at that moment I thought, I have to do something to save myself and the baby. I told Irit that I have to get off the bus. We started discussing how I should go about it. Excuse me... She has to get off. No one gets off. She's pregnant, she has to get off. No one gets off! Your water broke, start breathing heavily, okay? I pretended to faint. Excuse me... Her water broke. She's pregnant, her water broke. The baby's coming. Baby. You understand? She has to get off. Jamal! We have a problem. -What? -She says she has to get off. No one gets off. No one gets off! Her water just broke. Let her go! Her water broke, she's pregnant. Please! Sit down. -She... -Sit down! You have enough people, let her go. What are you doing? Let her go! Suddenly everyone tried to persuade him to let me go. Let her off. Nobody move! And I kept up the ruse. I didn't let up for a second. I couldn't believe that he was letting me go. My legs were shaking. I was so happy that me and my baby were safe. But I was sad, too. I may have been safe, but there was a bus full of people on the way to the unknown. Come on, let's get out of here. Are you done? Can we go now? No, not yet. How many photos do you want to take? One. Rino will publish only one picture and I don't know if it's here or if it's here. Then when are we leaving? -Soon. I have to get a picture of Arens. Another right-winger... And they made him defense minister... Did you know his son is a Matzpen activist? Yeah, I heard. How does a man who can't educate his son to follow his own politics take over our defense establishment? Can you explain that to me? Huh? Hey! We're approaching Ashkelon Junction and I'm hoping that we'll enter Ashkelon and we'll be rescued, but then I hear that... the terrorist is holding the wheel. They didn't want the driver to turn right into Ashkelon. He was shouting at him: drive, you bastard! His words are etched in my mind. The hardest moment of the hijacking was driving past Ashkelon Junction. That's when we realized we weren't going home, we were on our way to some horrible place. There was this sense of doom, people started to cry, I felt helpless. Police. Police. Jamal, police. What do we do? After the bus drove away I ran in the opposite direction. A guy from Ashkelon stopped his car, I told him what happened, I said there's a gas station not far away and that we should get there fast and notify the police. Come here. Don't let him stop. Go! Go! Go! Put women and the children to block the window. The terrorists told me to move to the back, next to a woman and two children, they tried to create a human shield so as not to be hit by gunfire. Armored infantry, set up blockades. I was sector commander and brigade commander in Gaza. "Ashuach" forces, this is "Head Ashuach", the bus must be stopped so it doesn't reach the camps or to Rafah. I repeat, the bus must be stopped. Over and out. This is "Tziporen", the road block at Erez has been breached. I get in the jeep and drive north. At Jabalia there's another road block, the bus drives through it, too. It approaches the city of Gaza. There the Israeli police block the road with a citrus fruit truck. The bus sees the truck, drives onto a traffic island, bypasses the truck and keeps going. The road block was breached. It's continuing south. When I get that report I realize that they want to get to the Egyptian border, that's what went through my mind. I said, that bus will not reach Egypt. Deputy "Rakefet", this is "Head Ashuach". I'm 200 meters ahead of you, keep up pursuit of the bus. I laid down spikes before the junction. If the bus drives through the road block you have authorization to open fire aiming at the tires. I repeat, after the road block, open fire. It was 8 km from the Egyptian border and that's why I made the decision to open fire on the bus, and it wasn't an easy decision. Spikes! Suddenly we hear gunfire and Stevie grabbed my head. Duck, they're shooting! 3 bullets cut through the seat. I've been shot! We tried to hide between the seats. People were yelling, crying, and the gunfire didn't stop. I've been shot! Jamal, I'm losing control. Suddenly we hear a thud near the tires, the bus swerves to the right and comes to a stop. The bus stopped, I sustained injuries to both my legs. Run! We hear: Run! Jump out! Run! Then the screaming and chaos began. Help me get them out. You have to knock the window open. People started jumping out the windows. I think I passed out. Ilan, the driver, opened the door and escaped. They helped the children out, then their mother. And the terrorists are trying to sit us back down. Our adrenaline was pumping, we just wanted to escape. No one move! And then he pulled out the grenade. I was shaking all over, I couldn't speak. We'll all die! We realized we had to sit down and do as they say, we had no choice. We feel totally abandoned. The entire back seat where I sat was riddled with bullet holes. Another missed opportunity, instead of jumping out, we stayed in the bus. Whoever remained in the bus sat down and withdrew into themselves. Those were unbearable, terrifying moments. Armored Infantry activate "Celestial Army". "Celestial Army". This is not a drill. I returned to Israel after visiting elite units in the U.S. army straight to military maneuvers in the south. After a few days without sleep I returned home and my wife took the kids to the movies so I could sleep. Sir! Everyone's looking for you, you're not answering your phone. I didn't hear it ring. What happened? A bus was hijacked on the way to Ashkelon. Wait downstairs, I'll be right there. Make sure Celestial Army was activated. I called General Staff headquarters, deputy chief of staff was Major General Ivri. I said, I just heard, Within three minutes I'll be on my way to Dov Air Base with all my gear. He said: We might not need you there. I think the event will be over before you get there. I said: I'll be there. At around 8 p.m. I was coming back from a local base. I got a phone call: "Celestial Army" has been activated. At that time I was in a meeting with the deputy commander, Kobi Frumer. I get a message on my beeper, "A bus has been hijacked, wait for further instructions." I talked to my Operations Officer and the well-oiled machine was set in motion. Kobi asks me for more details. He says: Thank you, Operations Officer, I'm going to the scene. I say: Kobi, the unit commander said we should wait. Kobi is a large man. He says: Operations Officer, you stay here, I have to be there. My military secretary was Danny Yatom. He informed me that a bus had been hijacked. He told me where, so I said: Okay, I'm going there. You won't believe this, he's not speaking today. -Who? Arens. Gimme a break. They said he had to leave the convention, I didn't get his picture. Those bozos, then what were we waiting for? Maybe something happened. Then our beepers go off. I don't even think the paper informed us, it was a spontaneous decision to go after the bus. We didn't ask anyone at the paper. Once we heard what was going on, Natan and I got in the car and Natan drove like a maniac. I was stressed at every road block, wondering whether we'd get through or not. Until we tailed an ambulance and I remember soldiers and cops yelling: Stop! Stop! And we kept driving. We were among the first to arrive. We went from a terribly boring event to an event full of adrenalin. What's up with this? We got there at around 10 p.m., I don't remember exactly. Move, move... Natan Zahavi, Hadashot Daily. The army didn't restrict us, they just said we must stay a certain distance away from the bus. 20 or 30 meters from the bus. Over there, with the rest of the reporters. Excuse me, is the defense minister here? Half the country is here, can't you see? Thank you. We weren't restricted, the fact is we weren't shot at when we reached the road blocks. Think about it, civilian vehicles driving through military road blocks. Today, no way! We'd be shot. Press down. Yochanan took a bullet to the thigh and he was bleeding. Once Irit and Ze'ev, the two medics on the bus, got permission from the terrorists to treat the wounded, I remember Yochanan telling them what to do because it was dark in the bus. There was this horrible darkness outside. It was pitch black, you couldn't see a thing. I was at home in Jerusalem. One or two evenings before I took over command of the unit and I didn't have a position. Omer was going to replace me, he was battalioin commander of the reserves. The date was set for Thursday, the day of the incident. But for some reason he said: My reserve unit asked that we postpone it to Sunday, a few days later. I said: No problem, Sunday is fine. Then I get a call from the unit at midnight. Someone must have added me to the end of the list because I wasn't on duty and they said: There's an incident. I had this small rental car and I set out. I get there and see the bus where the terrorists are holding the passengers hostage. The head of the "Shin Bet" was there, Avraham Shalom, and the IDF Chief of Staff. The counter-terrorism Police unit was already there with snipers, ready for action. The first thing I did was disperse all the people that were around Shai so that he could focus on the task at hand. I patrolled the area with Omer and the Intelligence Officer to understand what we were dealing with. There was no sense of urgency. This wasn't an event that required a hasty response, rather observation and thought as to how to proceed. Kobi arrives, he is briefed, he'll be the one to negotiate and convey the information to us while we were preparting and trying to work out what we should do. We set up the routine front command squad and think tank. Hundreds of people were there, civilians, soldiers, reserve soldiers, journalists, photographers. I went back to the front command squad and the Chief of Staff said: Take command of the event. I asked for a bus like the one that was hijacked. I called Omer Bar-Lev over, he was about to replace Shai Avital, and I asked that they convene everyone for a briefing and prepare for a takeover. Itzik Mordechai, the Chief Infantry Officer, called me over, he was having a discussion with several people. Itzik, let Kobi talk to them first. Let's figure out who we're up against. One of my guys talked to them, they're demanding that we free prisoners. It's hard to tell how serious they are. We had discussions, we negotiated with the terrorists to see... where we could take it. I understand that Shai is conducting a simulation with the Matkal recon unit. We brought the exact same bus and they're practicing the takeover. How long will it take? They'll be ready in one hour. I kept in mind that there's a bus, there are civilians, soldiers, Israelis trapped inside, there are terrorists with explosives and a disaster could occur at any time in and around the bus. I suggest we discuss a plan to take over the bus. There were two options: the police counter- terrorism unit or the IDF's Sayeret Matkal. I didn't think it was right to impose it on the Police unit because they were deployed all around. I thought it would be better for Sayeret Matkal to practice on the practice bus a few times. Do we have snipers surrounding the bus? -Yes. But it's not that straightforward, they're liable to hit civilians. We must explore the option of initial gunfire from short range. Omer, is there anyone who can get in the bus with a hidden gun? I have just the man. D. was a reserve officer who trained us in gun fire, he was the ultimate gunman. Some say he is to this day. Dovi is the best gunman, but he'll have to get close to the bus so he can shoot from bottom to top without harming the civilians. You must keep in mind that I was wary of the terrorist attacks of the past - Kiryat Shmona, Maalot, Avivim, and I remembered the tragedy of those events. In the Coastal Road Massacre I was driving across from the bus from the opposite direction to Sdot Yam and I didn't know it, but when we arrived at Gelilot Junction, the bus had already exploded and was on fire and we had to help evacuate victims. It was a hard scene to bear. I say this as background because naturally each one of us has prior events etched in our memories and my memories were stained with the harsh events and the dire outcomes. A bus that is hijacked by terrorists, as with other terrorist attacks, can be subject to a painful end. At one point there's this flash of light, the bus is illuminated in a bright light and it made us feel good. We felt in control, we could talk to one another, see one another. It gave us a sense of security and the terrorists didn't like that. Watch the back and sides, so they don't surprise us. Generally the terrorists ask to speak to a certain ambassador or someone like that. and thus we approached the bus, in an open and exposed way. We just want to talk. Stay away! Brother, we just want to talk. No weapons. Who are you? I'm the man you want to talk to. Are you from the army? Let's just say I have a direct line to the prime minister. He'll be informed of everything we discuss. My name's Kobi. What's your name? Who are they? The situation was extremely bizarre. He's the representative you requested, his name is John. And this is Eran, my driver, he's always with me. It was like a movie set with huge projectors aimed at the bus, all the top commanders behind the projectors, Itzik Mordechai, the Chief of Staff. And you're with these two guys hoping the terrorists won't suspect anything if we act natural. But it's not a movie, it's real, and we're facing terrorists who can kill us even before we get started. What is he doing? -Nothing. Nothing. It's just cigarettes. He smokes a lot. What's your name? Look, I'm here to help you. Jamal. Did you get our demands? -Yes. The release of 500 prisoners and a helicopter to Egypt within 24 hours. Any progress? We're waiting for the list of names. 500 names? How else will we know who to release? Go by organization, Fatah, the Popular Front, you'll reach 500. Of course, but do you have a preference? First the men serving long sentences and all the prisoners in Megiddo Prison. Can you release the wounded? So they don't die? 24 hours is a long time. No one gets out. And turn off the lights, they bother us. Turn off the lights! Turn them off! You'll get everything you want. Anything else? Don't play those games with us! If an armed soldier approaches the bus, I'll blow it up. Lt. Col. Kobi Frumer, an extremely sensitive man, arrives at the unit, has to take up his position, has to learn Arabic on the fly and is going to lead the most significant event of his life and that shows how unique Kobi was in the structure of the unit and out. This man begins negotiations knowing that the people on the bus must get out alive, and that all eyes are on him, and any mistake he makes could result in a disaster. The result manifests the will of the Likud members that I return to the hub of decision-making. Later at home I was waiting to hear word of the hijacking on TV but there was nothing. The focus was on the Likud convention, on the Histadrut and no one updated me on what happened. I was so tense, I couldn't sleep, I was so scared. At around 2:30 a.m. there was a knock on the door, my husband opened to find three Shin Bet officers with photos. I identified the terrorist. They said they know him, he's 19 years old. His father died a few years earlier, he works in Tel Aviv and they know him. As Kobi Frumer is negotiating he obtains information about the man he's dealing with, who he is, where he lives, where he comes from, who his father is, who his brother is. They're extremely close, they see one another. They're having an intimate conversation, like friends at a cafe on Dizengoff Street and then you go back and you have Itzik Mordechai, the Chief of Staff and Arens to answer to and you're in a virtually impossible situation. Jamal, this is not what we discussed. We said there'd be no bloodshed. What do you want us to do? -Give over the bus and get us out of here... I didn't want this to happen, but there's nothing we can do. We got into this and I don't know how to get out. Jamal, we mustn't kill, our religion forbids it. I know, but we're in this mess and it's not easy to get out. This is the only way to free 500 prisoners, including your brother. Get back there. The bleeding won't stop. This equipment isn't enough, we need a real tourniquet to stop the bleeding. Take over for me. Excuse me, when those men come to talk to you, tell them we need proper dressings. What's that? Bandages, IVs, morphine, things wounded people need. We didn't do that, your soldiers did. Yes, but you hijacked us, you're responsible. We're responsible? -Yes, people are wounded, hungry, thirsty, freezing from the cold. You're responsible for them. What's so funny? You think a few hours without water is hard? You think it's cold in here? I was in your prison twice, I begged for food, for water. I starved all night until I fell asleep. I'm sorry to hear that. I have 8.000 brothers in your prisons, did you know that? No, I didn't know. You didn't know. You people know nothing. I'm really sorry for what was done to you, I am, but if you want those men to take you seriously, you have to show them that you're looking out for these people. And please turn on the lights, we have to see what we're doing. I got the plans approved by the Chief of Staff, the Defense Minister and Itzik Mordechai, Chief Infantry Officer. I built the plan which was based on the counter-terrorism police unit plan and my understanding of the events in the field. We're working according to the simulation, it's quite simple, we enter from all directions - the two doors and the back window. Our green light is when Dovi shoots their commander. Dovi, you're in gunfire range, yes? Before we take action I'd like to join Kobi and Omer again when they negotiate so he gets used to me. That's what we'll do. If I try to get into Kobi's mind he knows that at some stage that this person with whom he is negotiating, whose trust he gained, and now they've become friends and having a nice conversation He understands at some stage that he will be killed in the end. How do we ensure they don't blow up the bus after Dovi kills the commander? The terrorist with the briefcase bomb is in the back of the bus and a sniper has his eye on him at all times. Secondly, after Dovi shoots, the whole business will be over in seconds. Ariel, what's your assessment? I wouldn't be in such a hurry to storm the bus. The question was how to continue managing the event. Everyone reported on their angle. I said that in terms of negotiations, if ever there was an event with a chance to convince the terrorists to surrender it was in this event. It is our impression, both Kobi's and the rest of the team, that we're dealing with amateurs. They let a hostage off midway. That's a fundamental mistake that shows total lack of understanding of how to conduct an event such as this. Then there's their conduct during the pursuit and at the road blocks. They never opened fire outwards and didn't harm the hostages. They couldn't stop the driver and some passengers from escaping the bus when it stopped, they gave us 24 hours to comply with their demands, which is... Sir, I questioned the driver and the people who escaped, I agree with Merari's assessment but not with the conclusion. Yes, they seem like amateurs, but that makes them less predictable. I don't remember what they said, if there are explosives or not. We approached them as if they were armed and organized. If it turned out they were less organized, fine, but that doesn't change the approach because there can always be surprises. If ever there was a prospect of ending such an event with negotiations leading to surrender, this is it. They have no action plan, their demands are all confused. They may be confused, but when one of them is holding a grenade that's more worrisome than reassuring. The terrorists were agitated, they saw and heard the commotion, they sensed that something was going on, surely they heard the choppers when they landed. We could easily have a vast amount of casualties on our hands. We have to end this as quickly as possible. How do we make sure that the hostages remain unharmed in such close quarters? The men train for this type of event, they know what to do. Can I tell you that there is zero percent chance that hostages will be harmed? I can't say such a thing. But I can assure you, we'll reduce that odd to a minimum. I had complete faith in the Sayeret Matkal unit, and its commander, so I had no doubts, no qualms, it all seemed very straightforward and they'd do what has to be done. When Kobi kept reassuring the hijackers and talking to them and saying their demands will be met, he achieved the goal, a partial goal, but at any time one of the terrorists couldhave caused irreversible damage. The hijackers want the light turned on. Great, I can take pictures again. Fuck that. Mark my words, they won't do anything in this darkness, they'll wait until morning, I'm going home to bed. What? What about me? How will I get back to Tel Aviv? Take a bus. I heard Bus 300 gets there... I'm glad you're amused. -Have fun and don't leave without the photo of Arens. Natan Zahavi went home at one point. There wasn't much to do, I took pictures of the bus with a long lens and everyone was waiting for something to happen. But it was a very long wait, the tension was insane because you know when it happens it'll last a few seconds. I think my boyfriend proposed to me. You think? Yes, I was getting on the bus, he was across the street. He said something but I couldn't hear, so I opened the window and a truck drove by... He was far away, I couldn't... I'll call him when I get home. If we get home. We will, don't worry. Anything could happen. Assuming you get married, when will it happen? After I get out of the army, I think. Right after? Yes, why put off a good thing? I wish my mind worked that way. Jamal! We got all of what you requested. I'll open the door, place it on the stairs. Go give them the stuff. You, come here. You bring it in. I'll open the door, you bring it in, but don't talk to them, understand? Yes. You listen and that's it. I told you, he smokes a lot. Want one? Want a cigarette? No. We're done. It was a long night, it seemed like an eternity. Time goes by and... you're terrified, you don't know what to expect. One person wrote a will, one told us about his son's Bar Mitzvah, due to take place in a few days. While trying to gauge the situation it was clear to me that... either they'll blow us up because their demands aren't met or... a rescue operation, that won't stand a chance because they'll activate the bomb. So many thoughts raced through my mind. I admired the mother who got her children out and escaped with them. I thought I was lucky to be there alone and not with my daughter. I thought of what would happen if we don't survive, if we won't get out. At one point they brought in water and blankets. The terrorists gave Irit the permission to walk among the wounded and give them water. She tended to Shosh Hagi, she tended to Yochanan, she took care of people who didn't feel well, not only the wounded. She was so confident. She asked every passenger if they need anything. "Do you want some water? Are you all right?" Here's a blanket. Here. Water. Here's a blanket. Irit helped me, she bandaged me up, she gave me a blanket, water, she sat with me through the night. We'll be fine. Thank you, sweetheart. Shai, I want to make sure there are no loose ends. My men are ready, each team at their entry point, the snipers are deployed, 10 seconds after Dov opens fire - we're on the bus. I approved the plan down to the last detail, I felt that everything was ready. I suggest we do it as soon as possible because in two hours it'll be daylight and that'll change the whole picture. Dawn meant that the troops are liable to be seen and we'll lose the element of surprise. But there was another very significant issue, what does the enemy feel? In the early hours of the morning people are drowsy, but when the sun comes up, even a tired person wakes up. The Matkal commander and I showed the plan to the Chief of Staff and I suggested we prepare immediately to take over the bus. The Chief of Staff agreed, as did everyone in the room, that we have to get this over at night. Had the sun come up and the State of Israel were to wake up to a terrorist hijacking with hostages that had not yet been resolved, the media would have a field day, the pressure would be on from the public, the families, the politicians and the situation would be much worse. Hey, did you talk to them? Didn't you think of escaping? It'll take a long time to release all 500 terrorists... When negotiations began, they demanded 500 terrorists and I thought, 500 terrorists in exchange for us? Of course the government will authorize it, I was so naive, of course they'll release 500 terrorists and this will be over. Remember Maalot? Entebbe? They never release prisoners, first they try to rescue. What do you mean, rescue? They'll come in here? Yes. It's so cramped, how will they tell us apart? What you have to do is crouch down as low as you can, right under the seats. I have to pee. We sat there for hours, I didn't drink any water or coffee because I knew that if I get up something bad will happen. I said to Irit: Listen, I have to pee. What do I do? I'm scared. She said: Get up, I'll go with you. Irit goes first, I walk slowly between the seats, I get closer, the terrorist allowed us to. Jamal. There's a problem with the prisoners. We have to talk. -Talk. It can't be done based on their sentences. Each organization wants to decide which of their people will be released. So be it. You have to tell me how many you want us to release... Once he opens fire, the troops storm the bus. And total silence turns into total chaos, whoever is outside starts to panic. I hear the gunfire and I get down on the floor. A bullet flew over my head, it actually grazed my hair, I crouched into the seat as much as I could, Irit hunched over, too, and we waited there for what seemed like forever. I closed my eyes, thinking this is the end. I didn't think I'd get out alive. I moved back because I was afraid, all the shooting and pandemonium, it was insane. I was sure everyone was in the bus with the army taking pictures. I thought, I'm in trouble here. I'm working for this new newspaper and I'm already screwing up, I have no shots of the takeover. One, two, three minutes later it was all over. Suddenly I hear, "Clear out." I ran to the front of the bus. I just flew through the air because there were so many wounded people in the aisle and within seconds I was out. They broke the back window, removed the wounded, but not me. When they shot the terrorist, his blood was all over me and they thought I was dead. I said something like, "What about me?" And in a second I was lifted up and removed through the back window. I was bummed out, the big predators ate the meat and left me some bones, I took pictures of the wounded, the stretchers... I think it was my first time as a photojournalist that I photographed dead bodies. But I was bummed because I had a job to do and... I didn't deliver. I knew that the takeover would provide the strongest photos. I saw what went on, it was like an action movie. I've experienced many combat situations, including in tanks and against Hezbollah. Combat in view of rescuing hostages is the most difficult of all. It's the most extreme form of combat there is and everything happens in tenths of a second. That fast. After the takeover I went inside the bus. Don't look at me! Turn away. Calm down. Officer Nir was standing over one of the terrorists with a gun. He said: Shai, what do I do with this terrorist? I said: Kill him. This is a military operation. He looked at me and said: Kill him? And then I think it was Doron Kempel who said: Shai, I have another terrorist here. In units that deal in spilling blood there must be people who are not eager to carry out these tasks. The people who carry out these tasks must be deeply educated to carry out operations of this kind. It was much harder to decide to take them captive. It was a much harder to decide not to kill them. You reach a certain line and you stop there. Itzik Mordechai walked up behind me. Again, we're talking about a courageous man, he walks the walk. He walked in despite the risk of an explosive as opposed to some people who are heroes after the fact. He stood there. The terrorist in front was killed, the other was killed from external fire. We advanced to where Irit Portogess was lying. I couldn't believe it, I said: It can't be Irit. I see her and I can't believe it. How can this be? Irit was next to me. The thought that Irit got killed was unbearable. I didn't know Irit Portogess beforehand, and there's a reason I called Irit an angel because she was there for me the whole night long. Nobody can ever know, but some people believed and said that when she got up it was in order to help me, that she wanted to run to the back of the bus and help me. That thought weighs heavy on me. I never denied it, or said it wasn't true Even though nobody can really know. and I thought that for her parents it would be easier to think that that's what happened. It's obvious that if we were to give in to the terrorists' demands we'd be encouraging more hijackings so the intuitive approach the decision makers must adopt is not to give in to those terms. There's always the issue that people are liable to be killed, that people are liable to die when you adhere to the rule that their terms won't be met. Whoever was confronted with that dilemma knows what I'm talking about. We supposedly paid a small price on Bus 300, one young woman was killed, but the price is eternal, a young woman died. That's one person, but it's a life and it's everything. Pick him up. There were two terrorists on the bus who were subdued. What I wanted to know was the overall number of terrorists, if the briefcase was booby-trapped and if there were additional explosives. I removed the cartridge from my gun and I aggressively questioned them as to the presence of more terrorists and more explosives. Are there any more explosives? -No, no, no. Our largest fear was that one terrorist ,or more, were still alive, and if they toss a grenade or two in all that chaos or fire a barrage of bullets, it could end in a huge tragedy. Take him to the Shin Bet for questioning. Guys, take him off the bus. Take the other one, too. Ultimately, I think the policy was correct, the performance was good, and the right decisions were made at the right time and carried out well. Everything that happened later with the "Bus 300 affair" with all the developments and complications, that's a story for another movie... It was pitch black, I saw two men holding up a man between them. I was sure it was a wounded passenger being taken off the bus. And I took the shot. When the flash of the camera goes off, it blinds you and it blinds them. But once I took a picture of the two men who were leading him they jumped on me and said: Give us the film. When a budding photojournalist is told: "Give us the film," that's the last thing he does. I removed the film from my other camera where I had photos of the Likud convention and the other film with that one and only frame, I put in my sock.
