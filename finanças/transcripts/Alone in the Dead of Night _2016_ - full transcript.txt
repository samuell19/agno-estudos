It looks like herbies. Herbies? No it doesn't. Cold sore. It does not look like, you're a brat. It does not look like herpes. You're a jerk. Where'd you get this? Well one of my classmate took me to the Rose Bowl and an old lady literally begged me to take it with me home. And it's kind of cool. Mhmm, sure is. What? Smells like old people. I hate that. It freaks me out. Okay, and what's worse, old people or brats? Both. Touche. So how'd you get around the Rose Bowl? Well, she made me use a wheelchair. No. Oh yeah. It was actually kind of awesome. It was, move bitches, skip the line, just me rolling around. Well. Lines suck, so, I guess that's okay. Hey, you should be resting your leg anyway. I'll do that. Thank you. So? How was your trip? I know you. I know how you get. So we don't have to talk about it. Spill the beans. Come on, just because I'm miserable doesn't mean that you have to be. Hah, no kidding. Okay, we'll wait till later.

So you're just gonna go destroy your artwork, throw a hissy fit? It's garbage. Most great artists, like really great artists are tortured souls. I am not a tortured soul. That was really dumb, especially for you. I just feel that everything I paint lately is very depressing. Because life is sunshine and rainbows all the time. Like a trapper keeper from Lisa Frank in the fifth grade. Shut up. You shut up! Ow, fuck! You're a bitch, oh. Ow. No, not the leg, stop it. Stop, stop, stop. I'm not always mean.

He was a fucking asshole, Mallory. I feel like the ultimate loser. Seriously, stop that. He was such a loser. You deserve so much better. You're gonna go out and you're gonna find somebody who treats you like gold. 'Cause he, Chuck, is a lying cheating piece of dog shit. I love dogs. The fact that you're dwelling over him is seriously unacceptable. You dodged a major bullet with that one. Okay. Seriously now, you get free rein like the easy way out. You could go about doing your artwork still. Be single, be fabulous without having to worry about him and his shenanigans. I didn't want out. Mal, he was such a dick. You're not helping right now. I just wanna have a good time. My friend and some wine. Okay? Please. Fine. I'm not the one that brought it up. Yeah and you're not helping right now. This has nothing to do with you. I'm just beyond frustrated about everything. Well I get super defensive when people mess with my girl, okay? I know. Did you tell your mom yet? Nah. Nah. She has way too many troubles on her own. Don't tell me, what happened? Let's just say that men are pigs. All of them. ♪ It's so much easier to regret ♪ I have something that's gonna cheer you up. No. Come here. Come here, come here, you depressed little one. You artistic baby, come on. Fuck you. I got you. Come on. Okay, I can walk. Don't break the other leg. Okay, sit there. So is your stepdad at least gonna send you some money? Nope. And I can't get another job because of my student visa. And eventually I'm gonna run out of money and I probably have to go back home. Don't say that, seriously. I don't know. I don't know what to do. What is that? A souvenir for you. Ooh! You really didn't have to do this. Oh please, like I'm not gonna bring you something back especially in this circumstance. It's beautiful. Yay! Thank you! Thank you. Here, gimme, gimme. Okay, it's different, okay. Here you go. There. Where did you get this? Uh, dude you're never gonna believe the story. Ooh, I love it. What happened? Okay, so I went into this really creepy rundown shop. There was this guy standing behind the counter. And when I walked in, he just gave me the weirdest look. Like I was on fire or something, right? Weird. Really weird. But it gets weirder, because then, he like crosses himself like this and he walked away real slowly. Just eyes glued to me the whole time. And then, he walked behind a curtain, this big black curtain and just disappeared. So I bolted out of there, just like "Nope, out." So then I went to straw market, and there's a place where you get like, souvenirs and knockoff handbags, and like shoes and stuff. Like Chinatown. Like Chinatown. I went to this like frogwire thing right next to Chinatown. There's the cutest bartender in this place called like Frog Bar or something. He was just pouring me like Jaeger bombs like it was, Gwen, focus. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. So I was walking through the straw market Chinatown place and there were a bunch of women yelling at me like "Pretty hair, get your hair, "pretty lady get your hair braided. "Come get your hair braided." Ooh, and they got you. They're really cute. They're really cute. They're like so cute, right? They're really cute. They're so cute. They're like so cute. So cute. You know, you like them because they're like so cute, right? They're really cute, I like it. Oh my god, we need to call Patrick. Oh, oh my god I miss him. I miss him too. Is he still together with Daniel? No, they broke up. What? Mhmm. It was mutual, though. They were so good together. Focus, back to my story, back to my story. Okay, please, yes. So then I like sit down with this lady and she's braiding my hair and I decided to tell her my story about the shop. So soon as I tell her, she starts getting super serious on me, and, like grabs her bag, starts fumbling around in it and mumbling something and pulls out that necklace and puts it in my hand. No way. Mhmm. Get this, she leans in really close. Our noses are like almost touching, right? She looks me dead in the eyes and says you must wear this necklace for protection, pretty girl. This necklace, it will protect you. And that's pretty much it. That is so fucking crazy. I know. Besides, you need the protection more than me right now. And you like that hippy stuff. You're the best! It's perfect. What an amazing story too. Thank you. I don't know what I would do without a friend like you. I kind of feel like I was there a little too. Good. And you're not so bad yourself. You're ridiculous. Can't get it yourself, princess? What was that? You must have some really kinky neighbors. I don't have any neighbors. They moved out like two weeks ago. Okay, well, I'm sure it's just some animal on the roof or something. Don't freak out. Yeah. Anyhoo, I'ma go take care of these. For your majesty. It smells like rotten ass in there. It's probably your smelly ass. Please, it's not. You open it. Come on, wine's for the gods. Seriously, what the fuck was that? I am officially spooked now. I'm sure it's just the wind or something. It's not that windy outside. Yeah well, I'll check anyway. You're fucking freaking me out. I'm gonna go check the bedroom. Okay. Be careful. Gwen? Gwen? Gwen? AAA, I'm gonna get you! Aaaa! Ow, ow! I hate you. You should have seen your face. Show me your balls, you big baby. Jesus! It wasn't funny the first time. Uh huh. I just gotta keep you on your toes, girl. I'm gonna get you really hard. High five. Loser. Gwen. You brat, that hurt. What's your wifi password? It's not working right now. What do you mean it's not working? I mean I can't get the thingamajingy to work. Thingamajing, how long has it been? Two weeks? Two weeks? How do you live? I would die. I would literally die. Chuck used to take care of these kind of things and I don't know how it works, these kind of high tech things. You sound like my grandma. I talked to her on the phone yesterday, she said I can't work these high techie stuff. You will forever be a dinosaur. You're a grandma, aw. Dinosaur. You've gotta pee? I was just wondering where that sound came from. Are you still really freaked out? I could spend the night if you want. I could sleep on the couch, it's like a marshmallow. I'm fine, I just, I'm not used to being alone. And I'll get over it. Are you sure? I'm good. Whatever, your loss. And on that note, I better be going. Help me. Help me. Help me, Gwen. Save me. Use your muscles. Nope, over. Okay, okay. There we go. Use your muscles, strong lady. Ugh, use your good leg, Shamu, Jesus. You're like a million pounds for such a skinny creature.
