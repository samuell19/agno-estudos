My master once said, you can never put down the sword that feeds you. The way of the sword can lead a man down a dark path After all, the sword and soul thirsts for blood It's either kill or be killed. Even if you become a master, you will eventually be killed. I don't believe in fate. My master said, fate is an illusion. For nothing in this world hasn't already happened before. China’s ancient bounty hunters—-Off-staff swordsman without fixed salaries employed by government Gui Dao Lin! I'm not in that line of work anymore! If they want to die, I'm not going to stop them but there's no reason for us to kill each other! You've murdered countless people! You can't escape the blood debt owed this easily! Ten against one! What are you afraid of? ! Kill him! I'll double the reward! Wait. Let's observe for now. Hey! Hey! If he escapes today, he'll be back for revenge. Individually, we don't stand a chance. Attack! Stay back! I'll face him! Useless! The bunch of you! Go, cut the head off and take it back to the magistrate to collect the reward. Many thanks Cai Bu Tou. We might not have escaped with our lives. Good of you to know. What about the ones that died? Burry them. In their eyes, our lives are worthless. Our payment better not be in fabric again, how are we meant to survive? Let me talk to the magistrate. It's about time we changed the way we lived. Coming from Yiwu, I battled against pirates on the coast in my early years. After I was discharged, I drifted from place to place. I met my wife in the north west. She is also a southerner. I wanted to give up the sword and lead a normal life. But the way of the sword is all I know. I became a subordinate of the magistrate but struggle to make ends meet. I often think of what my master said- "You can never put down the sword that feeds you". Brother Lin wields a long sword. I also wield a long sword. I hear he studied the sword scriptures of Yu Da You. But the scripture only teaches cudgel techniques. I also studied a sword scripture and this scripture taught only the way of the sword. He never speaks to me about his martial arts. Da Wei! It's okay! Who might this be? This man said he is here to deliver you silver. Brother Lin! Your reputation precedes you. I'm just a nobody, where might the reputation come from? Tai Ping's first swordsman. Nicknamed 'Monster Sword Lin'. A terrible name, but a fitting reputation. don't turn around I'm here to challenge you! I don't accept, you can go. Are you afraid? Or do you find me unworthy? I have a wife and daughter now. Those fighting days are behind me. Stay for a meal if you want to be friends. If swords aredrawn, I may not hold back. You can tell everyone you defeated me. You don't accept? Yet you still hold on to your sword. You're not fooling anyone. You get quite a few challengers don't you? This is the only way I know how to provide for my family. A time will come when I will burry this sword. You won't fight for nothing, I'll pay you silver. I will wait for you at the graveyard after midnight. You will regret it if you don't come. Wan Yu! I bought you make up. The porridge is watery! This is the last of the rice. I will buy some more tomorrow. They've stoped accepting fabric. They only accept money from now. I see... How about... we stopped eating rice from now? I know the rice here isn't as good as back home but it's still what you are used to. Don't worry, I'll figure it out. Is this a friendly fight or do you want my neck? Of course a friendly fight. But who will believe me if I don't show them your head? Where's the silver? I hear you studied the scripture of Yu Da You. I have too, lets find out which one of us is the real deal! Real skill is within me, come get a taste! Again! Let me tell you a secret. Yu Da You's sword scriptures is written for the cudgel. Liar! How can a sword scripture be written about the cudgel? Yu Da You believed that within a cudgel lays a sword. He integrated sword techniques with cudgel techniques. It's a pity I discovered it too late. You have bested me, kill me. Get out of here! You're letting me go? Don't regret it. One day I'll come back to kill you. By then, I'll be gone. As long as you hold a sword, I'll find you. When I first began my training with the sword, I always asked my master "What's the next move?". My master said "You don't have to think about what's next.It's all a matter of timing". After all these years, I've no idea if I've made the right or wrong decision. I can smell medicine and meat in this room Have you been paid? Don’t be misguided by Lu Qian Don’t worry so much! Us sword masters always do things by the books Since you became a subordinate of the magistrate the silver doesn’t always come But no matter how hard life gets never touch the silver that doesn’t belong to us After marrying you I have become more cautious. Every job i take I’m afraid of not coming back This is what drives my sword to become faster and faster Da Wei! A Qiang! Stop running! Da Wei! I know your wife is sick. And you can't cook so I've come to help. How is everything? Has Sister gotten better yet? Sister How are you feeling? Sister! Are you okay? I'm much better. Here, I'll do it. Go rest. You wouldn't know what to do, here pass me the bowl. I'm really envious of your family. It's time you found another wife! It's not so easy to find someone like your wife! Father, I'm hungry! Me too, me too! A Qiang! You must give the meat to your little sister first! Little sister, you eat. There's plenty to go around. A Qiang, you have to eat and grow up strong to protect little sister. I'll protect everyone when I grow up! I've located Jin Man Tang. The salt and iron merchants of the criminal syndicate all pay homage to him. These businesses were all made illegal by the court. That's where the magistrate and Cai Bu Tou received a hefty amount of silver from. I've got a plan to replace Jin Man Tang. Gao Meng and Li Fei will join. Plus you that makes four. You're the master of the blade, we need your help. Do you want to become a constable or a thief? Lowly subordinates like us don't have anything. We'll never become a constable. If you don't go, I won't force you. If we fail, Just look after my son if I don't return. we will be hunted and killed. Your wife has enough to see a doctor this time. But what about next time? If we suceed, I'll help you to become a constable. It's still dark. Where are you going? To catch a criminal. Everytime you go, I get worried sick. From the day you met me, you knew this was who I am. How long will you be gone? I'll be back soon. Why don't you do something different? Different trades are world apart. I'll go prepare your provisions. Jin Man Tang's underlings have been sent away. When we arrive, we'll wait till dark and then strike! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! You dare bite the hand that feeds you! There are rules even among thieves! We made a decision to do this. There's no right or wrong. Everything is right when we succeed. We leave his family alone. We'll try our best but it's kill or be killed. try to Gentlemen! We have someone very dangerous inside, I suggest you go somewhere else! Who do you associate with? My association is with the highest authority. I abide by the unwritten rules of the trade. It's not worth your trouble. You must be kidding! Salt and iron traders have no authority! It seems they have a death wish! Let's make their wish come true! My lady! Ah! Jin Man Tang! do you want your son? Where's the gold?! Tell me and I will spare you and your son. Gold! Gold! Remember this face when you seek revenge in the next life! You've got the gold! If you don't keep your word, you're lower than rats! Last night must've been very dangerous right? Yeah If you are tired, go rest. I've been thinking about what you said. About what? Let's go to Jiang Nan. I'm giving up this life of a swordsman. Lord Cai! Did you get rid of Jin Man Tang? Indeed. You! You've got balls. Not a single piece of your gold is missing. Let me replace Jin Man Tang, you won't regret it. What is it that you want? I want to become an official constable! Impossible. I'll double Jin Man Tang's monthly offering. I will let you know. Sir... There's one more thing. What is it? It won't be easy to explain to the magistrate. Someone will need to take the fall for it to convince everyone. Let Dawei Lin take the blame I"m taking Ping Er out for a while. Don't stay out too late. Okay. Da Wei! It's okay. Don't be afraid. Cai Bu Tou, what do you think you're doing? I think you know what we're doing. Arrest him! Take him away! Tell me! Tell me who else you were working with! hurry up Tell me! Sister! Come! Come inside! Please sit! Why did Da Wei get arrested? I only just found out about Brother Li's arrest! Tell me what happened! I've heard it's got to do with some unexplained gold. I don't know exactly This time, I'm afraid it's more fortunate. I want to see him! I'm afraid that's going to be difficult. I know you can make it happen! That will depend on... I'll make the arrangement. I need you to kill someone. I'm not cheap! That's the reason why I'm hiring you. You better watch yourself if you don't pay up. I get it. Money gets things done. I packed you some water and food for the journey... I probably won't ever make it back. If you meet someone... -I'll wait for you to come back! Enough chit chat! Let's go! Lord brother Safe journey. Da Wei! Goodbye. Monster Sword Lin! Someone has hired me to kill you. Get on with it. What are you waiting for? You don't even have a blade. Where's the fun in that? I promise, you'll die by my hands! On the path that I chose, life can be fleeting. Exile and death, they are one and the same to me! The day you hold a blade again, is the day that I'll kill you. You let me go before, consider the debt re-paid. Go! During my exile, many changes happened in Tai Ping. Some people became the most powerful swordsman. From now on, this is my territory! Constable Lu won't let you get away with this! Ah! Some people entered the salt and iron business; some people came back from the dead. Ah! Some people, are still waiting for me. Ten years later Huang Teng Da! Enough with the bullshit. How much is our salt worth?! They've raised the taxes again in this town! Locals get 40/60 cut. Outsiders get 30/70 cut! What are you talking about? Last time was 50/50! Salt smuggling is illegal! Constable Lu Qian controls everything so the magistrate turns a blind eye. If it's too little, go find Constable Lu! Any less, I'll kill you. Feeling hungry. -Hungry? Better quickly go home to eat. Look! Do you like it? Oh? Brother! That looks like Lu Qian's son. The girl is pretty too! Yeah, get him! Beat him up! Where are you running too? Let go of me! Let go of me!! Father! I"ll kill him! Father! You can't beat him. I'll make this simple and clear. Those who want to die, draw your blades. Those who want to live, get out of here. Look who it is! Constable Lu! Although you are in the North West, this area still falls within the jurisdiction of the high court. And so to fight me, is to fight the high court. You really think you have the ability to defeat me? Win or lose, it doesn't matter. Once you draw your blade, I'll catch you. You don't think I will? Will you? -I... There's really no need is there? After all, you don't bite the hand that feeds you. We do all the labouring. You make seventy percent profit! Everything is a mess now! It's time for a change! Is it too much to ask you to share an extra ten percent with us?! My shit can be shared with you to eat. To appease the people, the Emporor released all the prisoners. Jin Man Tang is coming and seeking revenge to those that took away what's his! Lets go! You! Brother, shall I kill him to make an example? What's the rush? He's a nobody. Jin Man Tang is returning. Let's wait. Uncle! Who is Jin Man Tang? He's a sworn enemy of your father. Brother Lu! We have enough food at home. You don't need to send anymore. Stop being so polite with me, I'll do whatever I can to help. Wan Yu! Your hands are so cold! You don't need to go on like this. It's been ten years. Is it worth it? By the way, the Emporer has pardoned many prisoners. If Lin Da Wei is still alive, he should be returning home. However I fear he returns with his enemies. Brother! Is Jin Man Tang playing games with us? Play us? I'll skin him alive. Who's there?! Relax, there are many of you. Jin Man Tang? Qian Ren Zhan, have you really killed a thousand people? No need for small talk. Let's talk business. Who do I need to kill? And how do we split the salt and iron business afterwards? You're expertese is in killing, mine is in trading. There will be enough to go around. Kill these people for me. Are they highly skilled? If not, you don't need me. Of course they're skilled. He's called Lin Da Wei! Who? Lin Da Wei! I made a vow, if he doesn't picked up the sword, I won't kill him. Great! Spread the news! If these people run away, I'll destroy Tai Ping! By doing this, they'll be ready. That's how we make it interesting. When I drew closer and closer to home, I stopped thinking about the past; about what was right or wrong. I only thought about one thing: to finish my journey home. Hey! Who are you? Mother! There's another homeless man here! Coming dear! Da Wei... Put these clothes on. Just stop it! Mother and I have gotten by just fine without you these past ten years. That's enough! I'm just speaking the truth. Now that I'm back, my plan is to take us all to Jiang Nan. Go if you want. I'm not going anywhere! The people in Tai Ping think you are dead. But I know you're alive, yet when I look at you, you still feel like a stranger. I understand. Many things can change in ten years. Tell me! Why were you exiled? Whose gold was that they found? At that time, all I wanted was for our family to live a better life. Who knew I would fall into a trap. No matter how difficult life got, you should never do anything deceitful. These past ten years, do you know how we've survived?! I'm so sorry... Say something else! I was exiled three thousand miles away. I'm no longer the person I was before. I put down the blade, the person who I was no longer exists. Da Wei! I never thought you'd actually return! These past ten yeras, Tai Ping is doing okay? All these years, it's only now that Tai Ping is developing better. The situation is becoming complicated. Jin Man Tang is coming back for revenge. The emperor has pardoned prisoners. He is no longer wanted. All those years ago, when I stabbed him in the back, such a pity,my blade was one inch off. Now it's come back to haunt us. He says he's coming back for double of what he has lost. What we did back then was atrocious. I've decided to take my wife and daughter away from here. There's no where safe to go. Where will you take them? Who has taken over Jin Man Tang's business? I have. You? There's no good or bad business. I am a good person. By taking over this business, it has become good business. No one dares to compete with me. There is Qian Ren Zhan, highly skilled in martial arts. He often opposes me. I've heard of him, someone paid him to assassinate me. Unbelievable! I've thought long and hard about it. Who wanted me dead? Who do you think? Who ever it was, I don't want to know anymore. I just want to live out the rest of my days. Remember, you owe me my gold. Brother Li! That goes without saying! Who are you looking for? Uncle Lin! You are? I'm Lu Qiang! You've grown tall! Father said, ten years ago, you were the top swordsman in Tai Ping! Please, teach me! Martial arts will only attract the scourge of murder. Once the blade is drawn, it is difficult to control. I just want to protect Lin Ping. Alright, let me see what you've got. Again. Attack with the blade raised high to the sky. Defend with the blade lowered to the earth. With every move, ask yourself why? You cannot afford to make mistakes. Who taught you? My Father. Does your father want you to become a constable? No, he wants me to do business. Looks like he really cares for you. Come, again! Do you know why I've returned? The scar on my chest still hurts. Every debt must be collected. Kill me, let my family go. You're already a dead man. Dead men don't make requests. Ten years ago, you murdered my wife and son. You stole my gold. I wonder if I kill your family, will your heart suffer? If I die, will you let them go? Would you believe me if I said yes? Jin Man Tang is back! Li Fei's family has been murdered! Should we escape?! Where will you escape to? We've spent ten years building up to what we have today. How many people have died? How much gold have we spent? Notify Lin Da Wei to come collect his gold. Jin Man Tang wants revenge? He'll be the first to fight. Brother Li, you should see the notice. The bodies of Li Fei and his wife are in boxes under the notice too. Ten years ago, you were the first blade master of Tai Ping. Now... -I'm just an ordinary person. I no longer live by the sword. You've got your share of the gold. Yet you do nothing to help the situation. Do not forget, it was you who murdered Jin Man Tang's wife. And you murdered his son! Oh? Was it? If I hadn't stayed loyal, you would all have been exiled for ten years! You have the ability to fight the enemy, yet you choose to run away. Are you a coward? You live your life,and I live mine. Wan Yu! What do you think Brother Lin should do? A real man will do what's right. Do you know who we will deal with? Regardless of who it is, you must face the consequences of your actions. You see! You see! Even a women is braver than you. We will discuss countermeasures tomorrow. Da Wei, we can't avoid this. I remember the first time I saw you. You were waving your long sword around and saved me from the theives. I'll remember that moment for the rest of my life. Flowers may rebirth. But we only older. As we grow old, we need to do things that is within our control. You're afraid! There is no victory with fear. I cann't afford to lose, there are no second chances. I only want to spend what's left of my life with the both of you. Did you really murder Jin Man Tang's wife? Things that happened in the past, should stay in the past. I don't want my husband to be a coward. When I burried my blade, I wanted to avoid trouble. The blade is just a tool. The curse of the blade will be with us forever. Lord Cai! Will the magistrate be willing to meet with me? The magistrate has not received any homage from you recently. To be honest, our recent orders have been affected by Jin Man Tang and Qian Ren Zhan's interference. They have killed quite a few of our people. If you're not fit for the job, stop wasting everybodies time. Sir! We are low on man power. Qian Ren Zhan is quite formidable. Please, if Lord Cai can give us more skilled men. We're in this together! Who said we're in this together. You're nothing but a lowly subordinant. Remember, I'm the hand that feeds you! Me! There's no need to be afraid everyone! Jin Man Tang and Qian Ren Zhan are not a problem. No matter how high their skills are, they cannot be higher than the sky. No matter how tough their leader is, they cannot be tougher than the earth. We have Tai Ping's first swordsman,Monster Blade Lin. And I will be the leader! We'll attack first instead of waiting for them to come to us! Heroes of Tai Ping, it doesn't matter if you are an outsider or a local, I give you gold. Join us, fight for a worthy cause and get paid! Brother! We'll go at midnight. Thirsty yet? Our own wine that we make here. You wine smells like shit! I can't stomach it. That's okay. You don't need to drink this wine. Where is Jin Man Tang? Tell me, and I'll spare you. I don't know what you're talking about. I"m here to steal the gold. Stealing the gold? You'll die for that too. Thirsty yet? Gao Meng! Success or failure,it depends on you. Be careful! Don't worry, brother! Hyah! What's the situation? Tian Yi Dao was a set up! Go back and tell Lu Qian and Lin Da Wei to wash their necks clean for me to cut their heads off! When facing an opponent, you must master what your oppenent thinks you do not know! Do not use techniqes in which you are not confident against an enemy. Hide your weakness with your strengths! This will be my last time teaching you. Your skills haven't developed completely yet. Be careful with who you face. Let go of me! They're all dead! Lin Da Wei is next. Come escape with me! What are you doing! They'll be coming for you to! I've got gold and the magistrate's protection, we can survive! Let go of me! You go then! let me go what to do Father! What are you doing?! You two get out of here. You call yourself a fucking man? If it weren't for me these past ten years, your wife and daughter would've starved to death long ago! Do you love Wan Yu? With you, she'll never have the life she deserves! My exile, was it you? Yes! Because of Wan Yu? Yes! You piece of shit! Wan Yu and Ping Er will only be safe if they come with me. You can take them away too, but Jin Man Tang and Qian Ren Zhan will find you. Da Wei! Let me take Wan Yu and Ping Er out of town to safety then I'll return with men! Let him take Ping Er. I will stay with you. -Why are you staying? I will wait for you at home. We lived together, we'll die together. Ping Er and Lu Qiang are young still, they shouldn't have to carry the debt you owe! Father! I want to stay! I will fight beside Uncle Lin! This fight is beyond you. than force yourself You only have one life. Live your life and take care of my daughter. Once we arrive, we will come back straight away! Hyah! Hyah! Father! Let's go back and face Jin Man Tang and Qian Ren Zhan! Father! Fine, then I'll go! Master needs my help! Hyah! Hyah! Come back this instance! Hyah! Please come back alive! It seems the unfinished business ten yeras ago finally will come to an end. Gao Meng! -Yes! Take Ping Er and get out of here. I'm going to go save my son! Hyah! Why haven't you gotten out of here? Why bother! This is all I have. I can only become a begger if I leave. Who knows where I'll die. No more running! Give me a jug of wine! It's just you? Just me! Reckless. Surrender now. Surrender? You murder my wife and son, take my business and you tell me to surrender? Do you have no shame? My life, it's yours. But leave the innocent alone. There's no such thing as innocence! Everyone's a fucking accomplice! If you cut your hand off right now, I'll leave Tai Ping alone! Master! Don't do it! Lu Qiang! You must be Jin Man Tang. You want to destroy Tai Ping? You'll have to go through me first! Who are you? The constable's son! Kill them all! Why aren't you doing anything? We have more men. It just doesn't seem fair. I'll wait a little bit longer. I told you to wait but you didn't listen. Looking for death! Mother fucker! Stabbed in the same spot! Father! Father! Ah! Father! It seems you haven't improved these past ten years! Don't think it'll be easy for you. Even though our swords are different, but we walk along the same path. Is this all you've got? Once again, you look down on me! I knew you couldn't burry your blade. You forced my hand! I should thank you. I haven't let loose in a fight like this in a long time! Enough bullshit! Let's fight. Now I'm at the end of my road, I remember again what my master said- 'Fate is an illusion, for nothing in this world hasn't already happened before.' Da Wei, come home. Those sharp weapons are instruments of evil omen, and not the instruments of the superior man, he uses them only on the compulsion of necessity, calm and repose are what he prizes—-Tao Teh Ching
