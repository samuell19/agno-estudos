(silence) THEME SONG: Get on board you believers in the power of the Lord, there's a big rain a coming that we're all headed for. And the price of the ticket everybody can afford, Get on board, get on board, get on board. Get on board you believers in the power of the Lord, there's a big rain a coming, and that we're all headed for. And the price of the ticket everybody can afford. Get on board, get on board, get on board. Let me tell you how Noah, just in case you haven't heard, he constructed a vessel cause he'd gotten the word. All the creatures on Earth, they knew exactly what to do. They all marched up on the gangway, everybody walking two-by-two. All the folks in the kingdom had forgotten how to care, they were selfish and greedy, they were wicked and unfair. So the Lord said to Noah, get to working on the boat. While the sinners all are sinking, Noah and the ark will stay afloat. Get on you believers, in the power of the Lord, there's a big rain a coming that we're all headed for. And the price of a ticket, everybody can afford. Get on board, get on board, get on board. When it first started raining, not a person was afraid. All excepting the people on the ark that Noah made. Cause they knew from their Maker that the rain was going to fall. They'd have lots and lots of water, water 40 days and nights in all. In a while there was ocean over everything around. And it covered the world, nothing walked upon the ground. But the family of Noah, and the animals divine, they were comfortable and nourished, everyone aboard was warm and dry. Get on board you believers in the power of the Lord. There's a big rain a coming that we're all headed for. And the price of a ticket everybody can afford. Get on board, get on board, get on board. Get on board you believers in the power of the Lord. There's a big rain a coming that we're all headed for. And the price of the ticket, everybody can afford. Get on board, get on board, get on board. Get on board, get on board, get on board. [rooster crowing] [snoring] -Hmph, if it wasn't for me, some folks would sleep their lives away. [rooster crowing] -Sun's up floppy ears. -Oh, I hate roosters. -Sarah are you up? -And when haven't I been up before cock's crow fixing your breakfast? -You're a fine and beautiful wife, Sarah. Too good for an old stick of a man like me. Look at it, Sarah. All we own. You can see it all with barely a turn of the head. -Oh, you're an old fool, Noah, if you think I need anything more than what I've got. Now eat your breakfast before it gets cold. -Morning everybody. Morning, Ruth. -Good morning, Jo-Bab. -Morning Clodfoot. -Oh, silly foot. Itches like crazy. And you know what that means? -Uh, refresh my memory. -Rain. Foot always itches before it rains. -No way, not in the middle of this drought. -Tell that to my foot. -What's all the stamping about, Clodfoot? You're right, it is a beautiful morning. -Japheth, breakfast. -Come on Jo-Bab -Humans don't understand a thing you tell them. KING: It's not enough. I must have more. -I see the King's in one of his moods. -The King's always in one of his moods. -This treasure is an insult. It's nothing. The other kings laugh at me for having such a tiny, insignificant treasure. -Father, please. It's more treasure than you could spend in 100 lifetimes. -Daughters don't understand anything. King Caspar has twice this much treasure. And King Balthasar has twice as much as Caspar. My treasure is nothing next to theirs. What good is treasure if you don't have more than everybody else? I must have more. More! More! Go, fetch me more treasure. Steal it. Murder for it, but get it. Go. Go! -Father, the people are suffering enough. The drought has hurt them so. Please call your soldiers back. -Ugh, I don't have time to listen to your nonsense. Go to your room and leave me alone. -Poor Princess Rachael. -Why didn't I have a son who could help me conquer and steal? Gold is what I need, no useless daughters. Gold, jewels. There must be some way I can turn a daughter into treasure. -I'll go see her. Now let's see, her room is over this way as I recall. -Turn right, second window from the end. -Of course, I knew that. Uh, did you say? -Second window, right. -Just checking. KING: Get out of here you stupid bird. And stay out. -I was misinformed. -Got the wrong room again, didn't you? We've done it. Now what's happened to Paolo? There you are. Now hurry. Take me to his special place of yours. -Clodfoot, what is it? It's only a dust cloud. -Go to the house Japheth. -Why father? It's only a tiny dust cloud. -That's no cloud. It's the soldiers of the King. -Run Clodfoot to the barn. Run! -Run yourself, boy. -Hurry, father. -My legs are too weak. Leave me, Japheth. -No. -Hurry. -Inside Jo-Bab. -Open the door by order of His Majesty, King Shallow. Open up, or by the King, I'll break it down. Your treasure. I demand it. -We have no treasure. Would you like some milk and cookies? No, it's your gold King Shallow wants. -We spent our gold on seed. What little we have left must meet our needs until harvest. -Give it here. -Here. Take it and be gone. -Two coins. Hmph, you're a useless old man. -I'm useless, unable to protect my own family. -No, father, it's not your fault. The King is evil. Oh, If he were here now, and I had a sword, I'd-- -Hush, Japheth. No good comes from such talk. My family is alive and well, and that's all that matters. -This is a wonderful spot, Paolo. No voices but our own. No one buying or selling-- oh, someone's coming. -Well, it isn't fair, Clodfoot. We work hard for what we have. The King, he just takes whatever he wants. Oh, you should have seen the King's soldier riding right into our house, smashing everything, taking the gold we need to live on until spring. Who I'd like to take the King by the neck and [snap]. -Ah. -What? Who's there? Hello. Hey, cut it out. -Paolo, stop. Leave him alone. He's our friend. I think. -Oh, yes. -Don't be bashful. Come on. Let me see your face. Heh, heh. Slippery. -My name's Japheth, son of Noah. -I'm Rachel. Do you come here often? Oh, every day almost. It's where I come when I want to get away from things. -Oh, it's beautiful and quiet. Not like the city. -Ah, the city. And I have to go there sometimes. It seems full of people who want nothing more than to fill their pockets with gold. -No one ever has enough. Even those who have the most of all. -Like the King. -Yes. -It's nice to find someone who's, who's different. JAPHETH (SINGING): How delightful is her smile, in my hear she has a hold. She is sweeter than the honey, than the honey in the cove. And her laughter is more precious than the ruby and the pearl. I could be a prince of riches if she'd be my girl. RACHAEL (SINGING): He is caring, more outstanding, than at least 10,000 men. I would stay with him forever, and forever once again. For his words are like embraces, and his arms are warm and strong. I would follow him wherever. That's where I belong. I need no diamonds, your eyes so brightly shine. JAPHETH (SINGING): If you are all I have, the richest things are mine. TOGETHER (SINGING): When we're together, our joy will never end. JAPHETH (SINGING): Be my hope. RACHAEL (SINGING): Be my strength. TOGETHER (SINGING): Be my friend. You are radiant and shining and you sparkle like a fire. How I wish that I could tell you, I could tell you my desire. You are sunlight in the darkness, and you shine away the cold. And I wouldn't trade this feeling for a pocketful of gold. RACHAEL (SINGING): I need no diamonds, your eyes so brightly shine. JAPHETH (SINGING): If you are all I have, the richest things are mine.

Sheeah. -Hey, wait. -Will I see you again? -Tomorrow at noon. -I'll be here. [sigh] -I've outlived my usefulness Jo-Bab. Why has God kept me alive so long? -Because I need you, Noah. -Don't be silly. What need could you-- what? -It is I, Noah. -God? -I know you to be a good man, Noah. And righteous. Therefore, it is you I've chosen. -Chosen? -Yes. To build the ark. -You, you won't believe who I've been talking to. -Wipe your fee. I just swept. -God. I've been talking to God. -That's nice. -Really? -He wants me to build the ark. -Yeah? What's an ark? -A ship, a great ship. It's to be 300 cubits long, and 50 cubits wide, and cubits high. -That's a lot of cubits. -And he wants me to fill it with animals. -Ow. -Oh, someone is playing a trick on you. -Don't listen to Sarah. She doesn't know what she's saying. -I don't like this joke, Noah. It frightens me. -It's no joke. I spoke to God, and God spoke to me. -Now why would God want you to build a boat, Noah, and fill it with animals? -Because it is going to rain, dear Sarah, for 40 days and 40 nights. All the Earth will be flooded. We have a big job ahead of us my family. We must gather your brothers and their wives to help. -You're serious about this, Noah? You believe these words you've spoken? -I do, Sarah. The Lord will spare us if we build the ark. And he will spare our children and their wives. -A wife. -Where is that girl? Kidnapped probably. It'll cost me a fortune to ransom her back. -Here I am, father. -Daughter, I was so worried. I couldn't bear the thought of losing you, especially when I have such wonderful news. You are going to be married. -Married? -Yes, to Prince Colossis. He's very wealthy. I arranged it all this afternoon. He has much gold and jewels. He paid a very handsome price. -You sold me? -Sold? No, no. It was a gift. A gift of love for you. -Oh, father, how could you? -Rachael. You will meet Prince Colossis tomorrow at noon. I command it. -Japheth, wait. There will be no plowing today. -But father, the seed must be sown. -And we must save the seed for the ark. Go tell your brothers that I need them. -Don't tell me your rain foot's still itching. -Yeah, like crazy. -Doesn't look like rain to me. -The foot never lies. Noah could be right. Storm's coming, and it's a big one. -Go on, hurry, fetch your brothers. Time is short Japheth. -All right, come on Clodfoot. If we hurry, we can still be at the stream by noon. -Oh, what can I do, Paolo? I can't get out of this palace to meet Japheth, because I have to meet this horrible Prince Colossis. Japheth will think I lied to him. I know. I'll write him a note saying I'm sorry and promising to see him again soon. Here Paolo, take this message to Japheth. Can you find your way back to the stream? Don't get lost, Paolo. -But Japheth, how do you know our father spoke with you know who? I mean, he's an old man. His mind may be playing tricks. -He believes he spoke with God, and that's good enough for mother and me. -But the story about the rain. Why would God flood the Earth? -Father says it's because man's wickedness is great. -Whew. Oh, Princess, why did you choose a scatterbrain like me to be your messenger. Oh, well, I'll find the stream again, eventually. I just hope Japheth is still there when I do. -Oh, I never should have told her I was a farmer. I should've said I was the son of a wealthy merchant or Prince in disguise. Ha, you're right. She doesn't care that I'm poor. Ah, and that makes me miss her all the more. It's Rachel's bird, Paolo. Dearest Japheth, Sorry I couldn't come. See you soon. Love, Rachel. Heh, she said "love" Clodfoot. She loves me. Paolo, I need you to take this message back to Rachel. She'll come tomorrow, Clodfoot, I know she will. But-- but father, you can't tear down your barn. -I need the wood for the ark. -Where will the animals sleep? -On the ark, of course. -Thank goodness. I'm almost there. -I told you to stay out of my room. What's that? -Uh-oh. -Looks like some kind of a message. What? Let go of me you stupid bird. I'll have you on a stick for that. And for the last time, stay out! -Paolo, did you give Japheth my message? Did he send a reply? You didn't loose it? -So you're in love with a commoner, ay? A farmer. Well, you won't be seeing him at his peasant farm tomorrow or ever. You're staying right here in this room until your wedding to Prince Colossis. [crying] -I'll have that farm boy's hide. Soldiers. -You may be wondering why I called you all here. -We just figured it was because Noah was tearing down our barn to build the ark. -Noah is tearing down our barn to build an ark. -Isn't that what I just said? -This is yet another example of man's inhumane treatment of us animals. We all know about Sunday dinner. I say we strike. No more eggs until our barn is restored. And no more milk from you, Ruth. -Look here, you obviously don't have the whole story. Excuse me. Noah's building an ark for us. Once it's finished, he's going to bring aboard two of every kind of animal. One male and one female. But why, Jo-Bab? Because it's going to rain and flood the Earth. And every creature that isn't on the ark will drown. -What? Nonsense. Why it would have to rain for weeks and weeks to do that. -It'll happen. My foot tells me. -That's good enough for me. Clodfoot's foot is never wrong. -So much for your little rebellion fever. -Come, my chickens. We'll have nothing to do with Noah and his ark. -It's the King. Into the ark, all of you. -We've come for your son, Japheth. Where is he? -Oh, off somewhere, but there's no time for that. You must get in the ark. -Ha, ha, ha, a ship for animals. -Yes, indeed, and when the rains come, and the Earth is flooded, only those aboard the ark will survive. -And when are we to receive these rains? -Soon. Very soon. -But there isn't a cloud in the-- -So hurry and get aboard the ark. Do you want to drown out here? -You're worse than useless, Noah. You're crazy. Have wit enough to give this message to your son. If ever again he lays eyes on the Princess Rachel, his life will be over. -Princess? -We've wasted enough time here. -None of this makes any sense. -She couldn't be a Princess. She was so-- so normal. -Well, that's the end of it. The barn is gone, and the ark is only half built. -Perhaps if we made it smaller. 100 cubits by 15. -No. It must be large enough for all the animals. -Are you sure the others are safe sleeping on the boat? -The ark, dear. Yes. I'm sure they're fine. Tomorrow we begin to gather the animals. -That's nice. Blow out the candle, dear. -Two of every kind, one male and one female. Goodnight, Sarah. -Goodnight, Noah. -Now I have to figure some way to get in to see Rachel. -You're in luck, Claude. Tamara here knows a way into the palace. -Well, what are we waiting for? -Oh, this is the worst yet. I can't believe father sent us out to the desert, and for what? -Lions, One male. -One female. -I say we nap until sunset, then we return home, and tell father we couldn't find any lions. [roar] -Don't make me use this. Never mind. Don't worry, Hamm. I still have my chair. Back lion, back. -Please, Lord, deliver us from these lions. -So that we may deliver them to our father, Noah. -Oh, thank you, Lord. Rebecca, here we are. -We brought the lions. -Noah, look. -My word. I hope I have enough cubits. -Oh, my. -Goodness. -34, 35, 36, 37. 38, 39, 40, 41. -Isn't this astonishing, Horace? -Astounding, Doris. -I've never seen such a crowd. -And there's many more to come, my dear. Doris, Doris. -Horace, Horace. -Doris. Doris. Excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me, pardon me. I wonder if-- have you seen my wife? Uh, a smallish woman about so high? Rather slim. Have you seen her? -Where are the tickets, honey. I don't have the tickets. You have the tickets. -I distinctly remembered to forget to tell you to get them. -Well, whoever said an elephant never forgets? -I don't know, who? -I can't remember. -There are any tickets. -There aren't any? I'm sorry, hon, can you forgive me? -It's forgotten. -And thank you Mr. uh, uh, mouse! It's a mouse. Eeek! -Doris. -Horace, Horace. Up here, Horace. -Doris. -2, 3, 4, I-- I lost count. All right, everybody off. We've got to start over. -She's just inside those walls. Jo-Bab, where are you going? -Yeah, where are we going? -Around the corner. There's a side entrance. Now's our chance. -Hurry, Clodfoot. You guys stay right here. Got it? -Let's go. -Rachael. I have so much to tell you, and I don't know where to begin. -Then don't say anything. -Come on Jo-Bab, open it up. -I'm trying. If somebody would oil these hinges now and again-- [groans] I'm in. -Clodfoot. -Sheeha. Come on. We're getting you out of here. -Well, I can't leave Princess Rachel. -She's coming, too. Oh, hurry, my rain foot's itching like crazy. -What is it? -I can't leave without Paolo. You didn't think I'd leave you behind, did you, Paolo? -Jo-Bab, here boy. Where's Clodfoot? -It's a regular zoo. -If you think this is a zoo, wait till you see my place. -Japheth. Jo-Bab. -Father. -You didn't tell me you lived on a boat. -An ark, actually. You'll love what we've done inside. -Rachael, I know you're here. You can't hide from me forever. -We've looked everywhere, Your Majesty. The Princess is not in the palace. -Then she's run off to her farm boy. Go! Kill the boy and his whole wretched family. Go! Then fetch my daughter. Go! -Come on, Hebert. before Noah raises the ramp. -It's only a shower. The water will be gone by morning. -Oh, poor Hebert. Maybe I can swim out and get him. Oh, father, the soldiers are coming. -This is my fault. They've come for me. -They're too late. Come, Japheth, help me raise the ramp. -There's no escaping, Princess. Tell your farm boy to say his prayers. -Japheth, I'm so sorry. Oh. -Aah. [animal noises] -Well, here we are Muffin. -But Poopsie, it's a stable. -Well, so it is, Muffin. And there's no view. And, oh-- there's a horse in it. -Come on in. Not much room, but you're welcome to share what there is. -Is this 312? -Yep. -This is us, Sweetness. I'm afraid there's been a mistake. -No, no mistake. That us. Means rabbit, and you are? -Howdy-do-dee-do. We having a party in here? How's it going, Pal. My name's George. This is Gertrude. -Howdy-do-dee-do. -Well, I think there's been another mistake. -No mistake us falling together, Pal, because I can tell we're going to be best of friends. -Oh, what a time we'll have. I want to hear everything about you, dear. Everything. -I never met a stranger. That's what the boys down at the lodge always say. -Has anybody seen the bears? We're supposed to room with them. -Well, come on in. The more the merrier I always say. -Poopsie. Could you get us a private cabin? -Honestly, Muffin, there was no mention of a horse, or bears, or seals, or two rabbits, or I mean, three rabbits. -Is there a horse here? -That'd be me. -Rumor is you have some hay. -Over there in the corner, if you can find the corner. -Ah, this is the place, Mildred. -Name's George. George the bear. What do you do, Pal? Me, I'm in insurance. What kind of coverage you got anyway? -We're supposed to share a room with the flamingos. Are they here? -They were earlier. I'll help you look. -Is the giraffe in here? -Somebody call me? -Did you find the hay? -It's over here. Head for the seals and take a left. -Excuse me, pardon me. Excuse me, pardon me. Coming through, one side, big room, watch your backs. -Oh, Muffin, there goes another one. -Is this 314? -312. Close enough. -Is my Aunt Minnie in here? -And another. -So this is where everyone is. -I'm getting seasick, I tell ya. Seasick. -Well, we're still on dry land. -If the elephant gets sick, I don't want to be around. -No say you were to suffer a neck injury. -Who's up for some shuffleboard. -Move over a little. -Nobody move. I dropped my wallet. -I've been standing on the same foot forever. -I know, but it's mine. -My room must be around here somewhere. Can anyone help me? Hello? Hello. Isn't there anyone but me on this ship? Huh, looks empty. I suppose I'll just stay in here. -40 days it has rained. Soon it will be over. -It is always going to rain. -We will spend the rest of our lives on this boat with these-- these animals. -Be miserable if you must, but I've not lost my faith. NOAH (SINGING): I'm going to believe in the Lord and the power. I'm going to believe in the Lord and the power. When my blessings rain on me, I will be a water shed for Thee. I'm going to receive my reward like a shower. I'm going to believe in the Lord and the power. I'm going to believe in the Lord and the power. When my blessings rain on me, I willl be a water shed for Thee. I'm going to receive my reward like a shower. When my ship is open on gray, stormy seas, I thank my Maker, and the storm becomes a breeze. When I can't go further, I know what to do. I ask for guidance and my faith will pull me through. I'm going to believe in the Lord and the power. I'm going to believe in the Lord and the power. When the blessings rain on me, I will be a water shed for Thee. I'm going to receive my reward like a shower. I'm going to believe in the Lord and the power. I'm going to believe in the Lord and the power.

I'm going to believe in the Lord and the power. -Father, it stopped raining. -It has been 150 days since the rain ceased. And still, there is no sign of land. Spirits are low, but tomorrow will be a very special day, indeed. In the midst of hardship, these two young people have come together to be married. May their love keep them strong, and provide an inspiration for all of us in this time of uncertainty. Until the waters recede, and we step forth reborn into a new and better world. You are now husband and wife. Paolo, I have a mission for you. Our food and water are nearly gone. Go, Paolo, and find land or all is lost. God go with you little dove. Poor Paolo, you've gotten lost. I should never have sent you. Can it be? Paolo. And what's this? An olive branch. Then there is land. Tomorrow you will guide me to this place, and we will make a new beginning. -Well, Noah. It's over. -Oh, no, Sarah. It's just begun. [theme song]
