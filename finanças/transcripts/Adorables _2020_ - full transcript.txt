You will dare to say: "I'm sick of my child. The best time is when he's sleeping." -Yes. - There you go, well done. -You talk about education. That is what matters ? - Yes, it is essential. You think you'll do better than the others, than your parents. Faced with the problem, we don't know who we will be. We do not know. I thought I would be a great mother. -You are great. Almost... In any case, you are "adorable". -Thank you. happy music ... Ah ! -hot, hey? -Not bad. - Are you offering it to me? -Lila... - Please, mom whom I love more than anything. -Of course... Lila, you've already had five birthday presents. Okay. -Thank you ! Listen, this is your music. It's a sign ! Oh thank you ! - To Lila! -Wow! -Here, mom, the haircut. We're going to toast. Girls, I'll serve you orange juice. Here, Lila. We're going to toast. Here, Fred, take a picture. - Aren't we expecting dad? - No, he's late. -OK, cheese ! -CHEESE ! Door slam - It must be dad. - After 3 years, wouldn't you take back his keys? -I keep telling him. -I have already taken 3 keychains, it is useless. -He's there. -Excuse me, I am late. -Happy birthday ! -Yeah ! -Hip, hip, hip ! -Hourra ! -Come on, open your present. -What is that ? -Thank you, you are the most brilliant parents in the world! Merci. -It's easy when you have a child as adorable as you. -Merci. -Mom. No comment. - But... I didn't say anything. - Maybe she is like that thanks to 14 years of communication and listening. -I'm sure, my dear. I wish you many years of happiness. That adolescence is not hereditary. -Thanks Mom. - To Lila. happy music ... -Goodbye Mom. -Kisses my dear. See you tonight. -See you tonight ! -I would give him a pie, but I have too much respect for cakes. I am on the verge of depression. A phone rings. -I understand, Mrs. Gonzalez. Excuse me. -You are welcome. - No, no, you shouldn't say that. You are just married. You are married to a man with which you live, work and suffer. So between the flour and the duvet, you have to find your space. He is not paying attention to your desires, to your needs? -Not at all. - But you assured me that you loved him. The phone is ringing. -Yes of course. But he's so... - Excuse me. Your two neuroses do not walk together, but tolerate each other. -I would like it to be... The phone is ringing. -A concern ? -It's Lila, may you? -You are welcome. -Yes ? *-Mom ? -I am in full consultation. *-I don't want to go swimming. Can you email the principal? - Good news, you are not in sugar. You are not going to melt. I kiss you. See you later. Excuse me. Where were we? What have you done to make him look at you? -I no longer washed his clothes for him, no longer prepared his food, more love... - We're not there. It's only negative. You forgot the principle of therapy: "Communicate, but not hit". So today, we are going to innovate. You're going out of the frame and deprogram cellular information. I will allow myself. How long has it been since you gave him a blowjob? "A blowjob a day", huh. -Oh yes. It is true that it goes back a little. -It's time. See you next week. -Already ? -It's passing quickly. -Thanks very much. -See you next week. -Thanks very much. -Goodbye. -I hope the teacher is sick. - Or dead and buried. Fortunately, we have 2 hours of sport. -It's okay ? romantic music ... -It's okay ? -I have a lump in my stomach. -What is wrong ? Come near me. Oh, my darling, come on, my beauty. Come here. What is happening ? -Do you think I'm pretty? -I think you're beautiful. I am certainly not the only one. -I love you so much. -Me more. -Not me anymore. -Not me anymore. -Equality? -OK. But me more. - I couldn't live without you. -Do you have anything else to ask me? - No, it's fine. -Nope ? So, are we going to bed? -Yes. -Is your ball gone? -Yes, it has shrunk a bit. -Come on, sleep well. Sweet Dreams. -My mother yelled at me yesterday because I was on my phone. Doesn't your mother yell at you? - No, she's cool. It's him. Health. -Hi. I helped you? Glad to see you up. -Nice. -Bon... -Good piece, right? -Yeah, it's Romeo and Juliet. I'm auditioning soon. -Are you going to the DJ JV party on Saturday? -Obviously. Everyone goes there. You also ? -I do not know yet. I'm wondering. -Health. - Alright, get moving. Do you want a tissue ? -Why ? - To wipe your drool. The doorbell rings. Hurry up, we have Delplanque. -I hate him. Please. Everyone goes to this party. She's super private. You can trust me. The proof, I could have gone to sleep with a friend and go there neither seen nor known. But I didn't. -I hope so ! No, but I'm dreaming. Who is it, everyone? I hate this concept of everyone. What does it mean ? When it's everyone, it's nobody. Is she going, Margaux? - Everyone except Margaux. But you know Margaux. -And? -I beg you. I've got to go. Just Friday. It's the party of the year. In addition, DJ JV will be there. -I do not know. Who is DJ JV? -Mom, are you serious? It's the best, the most incredible, the coolest. Look, I have the invitation. Lily. - My doll, stop insisting. You know it's easier for me to say yes than no. I always tell you yes. Well, often. - But say yes, then. Say yes. -I am your mother. I have to protect you. You don't go clubbing at 14. What will you do at 16? There is an age for everything. Moreover, it is written. "Forbidden to under 16s." It's not a question of trust. That's how I see it. Will you say yes to your daughter if she asks you that? You will say yes to everything. I tell you no, because I love you. -It's like I'm preventing you from going to Amir's concert. It's the event of the year. -It has nothing to do. No one will stop me from going to the concert. I am an adult. -You are happy to ruin my life. The door opens. -What are you doing ? Stand up, darling! You're going to be late for school. -I'm not going, I'm on strike. -Quoi ? -I will go to school if you let me out. If you refuse, my life is ruined. I will have more friends, I will repeat all because of you. -Sure. You know what ? It's up to you. I respect him. I am calm, and I respect the decision of others. I remind you that you are not old enough to decide alone, but I remain zen. My child is a person who is not me. So, have a good day, Lila. A baby is crying. -Hello, Isa, how are you? -Hello. Yeah. - Is she there, mom? -Yes. -Oh good. I'll come back later. what is this sad face? Come in. What's the matter ? - That's it, Lila is a teenager. She wants to go clubbing. -Hallelujah! -Mum. -I said nothing. She had to take a little from her mother. -How are you ? - great. I celebrated my 12th night without sleeping with your nephew who is having a tooth. I have no maternal instincts. -Leave him alone. Put him in the nursery. -No, otherwise I won't take it back. Alright, let's not get discouraged. On va au concert d'Amir ! -Yeah ! -Finally an evening without a baby. -Looks like we all have an angel -I'm going. I have lots of patients. Kisses ! Bye Madam. Goodbye. -Looks like it's you -Frankly, Lila, going clubbing at 14 is nonsense. -I'm going to drive her crazy, she's going to give in. - With your mother, it will work better if you are communicative. -I've been like this for 14 years and she doesn't want to hear anything. -It sucks to get boring. -I don't think it sucks. -We talk about it after the exam. -Why not now ? - After the exam. -Hurry up. Oui ? - It's not the subject we were supposed to study. -And ? -We had to study metals, you can't change subjects. Guys ? -Lila, headmaster. -Why ? -Immediately. The others, stay seated. -Thank you for letting me know, Sophie. Lila was still active. I'm sorry for her. See you later. Thank you. We knock on the door. -Come in. -No Iswear ... Just two minutes. It's urgent. -What is it again ? -I have the jingle of the century. -We said you'd stop showing up like that. You promised to stop. -I have the jingle... - A patient is waiting for me. -I have the jingle of the century! -As per usual. -If you don't approve, I'm paralyzed. -OK. -You are the epitome of the housewife under 50. 40 ans. 30. -It is a compliment ? -Yes. -Super. -Good then... It's reggae, okay? -HM hm. -I like the taste I like the smell I like to lick it La sucer I like the taste I like the smell On a spoon... Or on your behind Pow! Pow! So ? It's beautiful, isn't it? That's awesome, huh? -Uh... Yeah, I don't know. It's particular. It's... - genius. It's chocolate. - Uh... Yes, but you see the picture? Chocolate, ass. -Yes. -If that's what sells... -You got it all figured out. Well, I told you, two minutes. Thank you. - Don't you find that Lila is difficult at the moment? The school called me again. -Why ? -Nothing serious. She still fought. If she asks you to go out on Friday, no. -I would have said yes. You did well. -I don't want her to be flirted or drugged without her knowledge. - rape, while we're at it. - Yes, rape. Given what's going on, you never know. Do what I ask of you. -I always do. -Yeah, that's it. -Victor, what a surprise! -Anne! I leave you, you will break sugar on my back. -I'll do it for sure. - Glad to see you. -Great. Go on ! Sorry. -Victor? Pick up your daughter at the dance. -Do not worry. -So ? - Don't you have a patient waiting for you? - You avoid discussion. - Can you close the door? -What's his name ? -Hugo, it's the most beautiful. -Hi girls. -Your father. Ciao. -Kisses. -Hi, Nina. Goodbye. How are you ? Do we kiss her daddy anymore? So this day? -It's okay. I went to the principal because of the chemistry teacher. I have no detention, the principal agrees. -I know, your mother told me. Do you have to fight for everything? -I'm a delegate. -Oh yes it's true. Well, and the dance? -Yeah... -Are we talking or are you laughing? -I'm grumbling about Friday because you do as mom wants, you are his doggie. -Ouaf ouaf. Good. What's his name ? -Uh... -That's what I was thinking. Sweetie. You take care of yourself, my doll, huh. -OKAY. -Take. -What is that ? -It's called a contract. I may be able to help you. Propose to your mother. It's not said that it works, but you can try. Motus. It's between you and me. -It's hard. - Do you want to go out, yes or no? -Yes, but... -Well there you go. Contract. Thanks WHO ? -Thank you dad. -Kiss. The door opens. -Hi, I'm here. My darling, don't let your shoes drag. -Hello Mom. - Was the dance good? -Very well. Take. -What's this ? A contract ? Wow! -It's more than that. It's the business of your life. "I promise to do my homework... Don't leave it lying around my towel on the floor. The toothpaste..." The dishes every evening? "And not pissing off mom for 8 months." Sorry, but I won't change my mind. -Serious ? -Yes. -But Mom, my life depends on it. I have to go out on Friday. -If he really likes you, he will be happy to see you during the day or to come here. - But that has nothing to do with it. You are a tyrant. I'll call dad. - That's it, call him. And if you want to start joint custody again, I'm not against. -It pisses me off to move. I see him all the time. -I'm going to blame your bad mood on your hormones. I'm going to get ready for my concert. Call your grandmother, she couldn't reach you. And take off your shoes. - "I raise my daughter in communication." bullshit! Applause and shouts from the crowd ... -I'm sorry, I messed up. I'm too excited. -It does not pass. -What do you mean ? -To go there. - But I bought my ticket. - It's not okay, go over there. -There is a problem with the barcode. - Yes, it does not. -What do you mean ? I bought the ticket! -ID card. -Thank you. The concert begins. Where is she ? It's not possible ! I do not have it. I changed my bag, it's absurd. Sir, please. Amir, he's my cousin, I'll surprise him. If I'm not there, he'll be disappointed. And it's my sister's birthday. You're welcome. I beg you, it's impossible not to go. - No ticket, no entry. -Look. A phone rings. -It's me ? Emma. -No. -Yup. -No ! -Yes. Hello ? Emma ? She's crying. ... -Hi. -Are you OK honey ? -It's okay. Was it your concert? -Nope. Worst night of my life. I couldn't get in, my ticket was refused. -Oh yeah ? It's stupid. -As you say. -I'm sorry. -That's nice thanks. - The others were able to enter? - Everyone is in. Do you want tea ? - No, it's fine. It's sad, but at least you see how it feels when everyone goes there except you. -Yes, it's true. - Can I have some cereal? - I am ashamed to suspect her. - I will never last until adolescence. -If she really did that, I have 2-3 ideas which will take away any desire to start over. Your sister, strong from your experience, did not have a teenage crisis. -I should have. I am always in the skirts of my mother. -I became a shrink because of you. I will do the reverse. I will let it pass. I'll be cool, don't give a fuck. It's just suspicion. -As you wish. If I were you, I would be vigilant. Your daughter is mad about this party thing, and an angry teenager can be unpredictable. - She said something to you? -Nothing. I'm going shopping for your dad's birthday. Do you really want to come to dinner? -Yes ! -Wouldn't we have a restaurant? -Nope. -Mom ! - I'm tired of being your slave. -There. It's exactly that. I'll be my kid's slave. -Oh.... How are you, Isa? -Nope. - I invited Victor. - But you can't! Laugh But why does it make you laugh? You could have asked me if it bothered me. I don't always want to see Victor. -Whatever I say, I annoy you. - Mom, she's right. The engine is running. -Lila, are you in pajamas? -Yes. So I can go to bed like babies, after dinner. - That's enough, go get dressed. -Nope. -Lila, your mother is right. Vis-à-vis your grandparents, it would be more respectful. -Non. - So, I understand your anger, but I don't intend to answer it. So you can stay in your pajamas, if you like. -Don't talk to me like your stupid patients. - You talk to me differently. -You have finished ? - We'll go in slippers. -Very funny. -As funny as you. -Good. You know how much your mom and I are for gentle methods, who promote communication. Your mother made me read a Scandinavian study who advocates talking to children... -Oh no. You're not going to talk to me about sex. I promise you, I'm not sleeping. -I hope ! - So, when you were conceived, your mother had... -A kind of libido boost. - Don't tell me about your sex life. -According to the study, the fact of having received in my belly, repeated blows from... Anyway. It could have caused a disturbance during this sweet moment of gestation. That would explain why unconsciously... -I'm not listening! - Sorry, my doll for this occasional inconvenience... Bital. - Well, sorry for the inconvenience. - But you are crazy! I forgive you if you let me out. -It didn't work. -What ? -The Swedes say that if the child is not receptive, it means that he has not suffered. You're not annoying because of... From your father. At least we tried. What did you want to tell me? -Don't you think Isabelle is weird? -Weird ? Weird how? -She doesn't want to make love anymore. This is not normal. - Ah that... - My love, present. I think he pooped. - Your husband is worried. Is there more fire in your panties? -What ? He told you that? -Mmh. -It's swollen! What time do I put it on, the fire? -I don't know. - In the living room with mom? I'm fed up. This kid isn't a year old he is already ruining my life. -My poor... -Hello, Dad. -Hello. You want something ? -Surely. -I would like you to explain to him that young people today go clubbing at 14 years old. I die if I don't go. - Don't worry, we don't die so quickly. - Steal your mother's keys and go! It will save you from paying for the taxi with your money. -Thank you for helping me, it's adorable. -Maman ! -Oh, I'm good ! If we can joke anymore. -Very funny. -Lila, are you coming to help me? We're going to the table in two minutes. Everyone gets rid of something. Intriguing music ... -Surprise. I was 14 before you. You ride. We will speak about it tomorrow. Intriguing music ... -What's the matter ? -Sorry. I was dumb. I didn't think. I wanted to go there so much. I know, I'm annoying. But I love you so much. We toast to peace? -I dunno. -Please. - Do you realize what you were going to do? Do you realize that? -Yes. - Can I trust you after that? -Oui. -So, do we erase? -Yes. - To peace. -Thanks Mom. My life is screwed up, but I get it. -Stop saying that. Your life is not ruined. You're a bit boring sometimes. -Good night. -Good night. -And don't tell Dad. -On will. Sneeze -Good evening. Cheers My God... Nightclub atmosphere ... I am so happy. -Me too. ... -OH MY GOD ! ... -He's there. Wish me good luck. -Good luck. ... -I don't think he's coming. -Sorry. Oh, hi. -Hi. You could come. -Yeah. -Awesome. - I break, suddenly. -Nice T-shirt. -Thank you. -Do you want something to drink ? -A Coke. -Really ? -Yes. -OK. Two Cokes, please. Nice atmosphere. -Yeah. DJ JV mixes at what time? -In an hour. -OKAY. - Do you have to go home soon? -No, just like that. ... 80s pop music - Something's going on, shall we? -Yes. ... *-Those who made the wall like Emma raise their arms. Crowd cheers 80s pop music ... - You too, you made the wall? We go back. Take your things. ... Little bitch! - My doll... But hey, it doesn't matter, huh? - Never, I will forgive you. -That's the art of teenagers. Executioners, they become victims. - I am the victim! -No it's me. It was you who drugged me. - It was just a sleeping pill. Don't say it's serious, you did the same to your parents. -Ask your grandmother what I got as a punishment. It would have calmed you down. I have always been adorable with you. I was understanding. What are you doing to me? -You put me to shame with my life, is that nice? -I didn't shame you. If I wanted to put you to shame, I would have worn sequined shorts and I would have shown my breasts. My mother would have done that. To make you want more to start over, you are deprived of exit until the end of the year. -It's disgusting ! You were against punishment. - It's not that, it's a protection. I have another idea. Where is he ? Ah! It's your new phone. You'll see, we love it. It's a bit medieval, but... Give your phone. I will put the SIM card. Give the ! You give me your cell phone. - Leave it to me at least until tomorrow. -You'll soon get used to it. The door slams violently. Take. It is not tactile. You have to press the keys. She screams. -You see, it's handy to have the spare keys. -Thanks for coming. - Is she up there? -Yes. -Tell me. It's your mother who inspired you? -Nothing to do, why are you talking to me about my mother? It is a Scandinavian method of conflict management. -Scandinavian? -My mother was cruel, I chose humor. I taught him a lesson. - Your mother also said that. I'm going to see her. - Go take care of your daughter. -I hate you, you bitch. Take that in your mouth! - It's good, great. Keep on going ! It's important that it comes out. Go ahead, carry on. Come on, again. Hold on. The problem is that you type like that. When you strike, it's with the plate, there. Take this, take this. Go again. But be careful, you don't insult your mother. Go ahead. There ! Well... Not smart, huh? You're not supposed to replicate your mother's nonsense. SMS ringtone What's this ? - But bug, how does it work? -Your mother spoiled you with this. It's vintage... Ah yes, sorry. So... It's Margaux who says there's a video of your mom on Youtube. -Your phone, dad, quick! Give me ! Give me ! -Yes ! Here it is. Cheers -Here, look. She's screaming. - Wow, there's choreo and everything! -Give me ! - Wait, Lila! Lila, don't! Don't, Lila! -I hate her. -No, Lila! -You were filmed, look. -What do you mean ? -Dance. -It's crazy. - You are ruining my life. You are a filthy hypocrite. If I have a daughter I will never do that to her. I will be nice. I'll be super nice. - Repeat what you just said? Am I not nice? Am I not nice? Me, am I a filthy hypocrite? You piss me off. There. It's clear ? - She's sleeping at my house this weekend. - Go sleep to your father. -Let's go. -I'm going to sleep, I drank half your glass. -Yeah. -The video is everywhere on Internet. The teenagers giggle. 80s pop music -Purple? Lila! - You shouldn't stay with me. It's going to be the loose. - Are you dumb or what? I do not care. One day popular, one day banned, who cares. -"Me myself and I", is it okay ? - Bunch of freaks. Lila's phone rings. -What is that noise ? -Shit. Besides, she's my mom. - Is there a problem, are you? Does it make you laugh ? Nothing classier than vintage. Bunch of morons. It's good, have you seen it? - Stop denying, mom. I know it was you who told him about the sleeping pills. Do you want to cause war in my house? -I swear I don't remember. Do you think I have Alzheimer's? enraged cry She told you I told her about it? - No, but I know it. Why did you do this to me, mom? -It is not me ! In any case, bravo for the disco. You blew me away. - How so, well done? I swore to myself to be different from you. But look at me. I do the same. My daughter is drugging me and I'm freaking out. Instead of just going to get her, no, I danced. Like a bitch. Like a hysteric. Why ? I don't understand why I reacted like that. Like you. I was zero. -It's not so bad to be a bit like me. I know you're mad at me for sabotaging you a few times. But I had no choice. I had to put you back on the right track. -We always have the choice. We've already talked about it 100 times. You think you're right, I think you've gone too far. You could have listened to me, talked to me, been patient. -Hum hum. Like you the other night. Sad music ... A door slams. Sad music ... -I bet she forgot to weigh her vegetables. -I am old, but not deaf. - Excuse me, I... Sorry. You are not old. I love old people. I loved my grandmother. And then, we have... Laugh We have the right to forget to weigh our vegetables, right? I may have forgotten too. Excuse me again. You are beautiful. -Good, I will help you, Mrs. Maréchal. -We're going to help you, Madame Maréchal, huh? Hop! That's it, finished. -23,50 euros. -Thank you. -Here it is. -Have a good day. -I am ashamed. Sorry, I was in a hurry I thought she would never get there. That's why I said that. -It always works. -Ah, it's not just me, okay. -I don't know what I preferred, your choreo, or your girl's face in a club. -It's not true ! Ah don't ... Have you seen the video? Shame. My daughter hates me. - I am Jules Verne. -Ah, Jules Verne ? -Not the real one. -I imagine. - My name is Jules, but not Verne. DJ JV It's me. -Ah, DJ JV! Ah yes, delighted. -Nice to meet you. -I am Emma Renaud, psychologist in Saint-Gilles. Non-violent, I try, in any case. - Okay, I'll leave you alone. - My daughter adores you. -Thank you. And your husband ? -My husband ? No, there is no husband. There. -OKAY. Tonight I'm mixing privately. I test stuff If you want to come by, that would be my pleasure. - That's nice, but I can't. -It's a shame, there's DJ Victor Hugo and DJ Balzac. -Oh yes. -It's a joke. They don't exist. -I am completely... -Goodbye. -And your wife will be there? -Ah, I have been separated for six months. No children, friendly, faithful. Besides, I'll help you with your bags. Well... - Do you like opera? -Oui. -I don't see anything suspicious. -Oh good ? You are sure ? -You have changed detergent or food? -No no. -Your itching is not constant. It is necessary to determine when they appear. - It depends, a lot. Sometimes not, sometimes all the time. - Do you have children? -Yes, a 14-year-old girl. - That's what I was afraid of. We have an epidemic right now. You have an acute form of Urna Morbida Magne Puer. -It's serious ? - You are allergic to your daughter. -What? -You just have to wait for her to come out of adolescence. -Wouldn't that be lice? -No, it's not lice. - I have to drop the Hugo case, right? -Yeah. - Am I kidding? -Hum hum. -I am unbearable ? -HM hm. -I don't know what I find in him. -Me niether. -Do you find it ugly? - No, neutral. -Oh yeah ? -You cling to a guy who doesn't look at you. The greatest quality of the man in your life, is that you are the woman of his life. -You're right. Fuck Hugo. -Hi. How are you ? Have you seen Jules Verne's commentary on your mother? - No, what else? - "That's absolute class." -Oh yeah ? -There were 32,000 likes in one night. -Serious ? -Yeah. I leave you, I have class. See you soon. -Lila ? -He stopped to give me a kiss! It's a good sign, isn't it? -He is interested in J. Verne, yes. - He should think that I am 16 years old. -Here we go again. It's not a question of age. If he likes you, he likes you. Stop messing around now? And you reconcile with your mother. -You're right. -It's okay ? -Shh, your daughter is here. - No, it's not good. Think twice. - I did something stupid, but I killed no one. -Are you being stupid or are you really stupid? -Admit it, you're happy that I'm finally pissing her off. -No not at all. Because you are overstepping the bounds. And I'm sad for her. I swear to you that if I had been in your mother's place, I would have found a fierce way to make you feel what you did to him. - Well, what do I do? -You sincerely beg her to forgive you. -Mom, I think you... What did you take? - What you told me. -It's not that one, it's the 23rd, I think. - Sorry, I'm confused. - We are coming, madam. Emilie Gassin : "Hard Enough" ... - Sorry for drugging you. I don't like arguing. But it's just that I... -You what? -I like you. I'm sorry for everything. I've been mean and horrible. ... -Attends. ... Here, I give it to you. But... no exit. -Thanks anyway. Thank you. -Ahem... A certain Jules Verne, but who doesn't look crazy, is at the reception. -What? -Hmm? Explanations? - There is no explanation. I don't have to tell you about all the people I meet. -You puff me up with your daughter, but you're not talking to me about the essentials? -He's a guy I met at the supermarket, we talked. -And how did he get your address? -I told him my name and that I was a shrink in Saint-Gilles. -He's a smart one. It excites me. You think he knows 80 positions? - Calm down, you nymphomaniac. Can he go up? -Yeah. - No, I'm going down. Wait, wait! I put on some lipstick. -You're hot. -You speak. Hello. What are you doing here ? -I want to invite you to dance to my next single. -Are you kinding me ? -Yeah. To make up for me, do you want to have dinner with me on Saturday? -Oh yes ? I don't know, it's nice. With pleasure. -There. -And thank you, thanks to you, my daughter became popular overnight. -Oh yeah ?

I'm tired of playing my role as an understanding shrink. It's been years that I fight against impulses of nervousness by putting me in a cretin over-zenitude. I can't take it anymore.

What happiness! -Did you tell him about your frustration? -He does not care. If I don't act, he's gonna drive me crazy. -Ah, yes... -He is stronger than me. Nothing stops his bullshit. I just want to embed it... -Go for it. - To unscrew his head. To yell at me... -But yes. - Click the vocal cords! -There. Relax, it feels good. You know, I too have a teenager at home. Well, it's going very well. I enter his world. You were a teenager. You have to enter their world! Hello, Mrs Dupont. "Hello." Oh no, I have no problem with my child. Yes, I'm very lucky!

It was a lesson. -Do you see what you did to him? - We'll talk about it quietly. -I'm !
