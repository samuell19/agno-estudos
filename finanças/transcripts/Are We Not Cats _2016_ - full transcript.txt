Look at that, he hooked you up. Technically, that's my money. The way I see it, you kinda owe me a little bit, so maybe you can gimme a fuckin' ride 'cause I got no other way outta here. You'd do it? -Whoa. Dude that... Oh, man! Yeah, that's good. I think that's toxic. Do people drink that? Huh? I said, do people drink that? Is that a thing? What you saying, I'm not a person? Here, take a sip. -I'm good, really. -No, take a sip. Come on. I gotta drive. Oh, fuck! -It's good right? -Are you kidding me? You should just puke it out if it's still fucking with you.

Red's a shout, green's a scream. I mean, this thing should be right at home in here. Here, let me rig it up for you. It's home made so it's a little tough to get going. There it is. Thanks. You wanna go make a fire? I don't know, where? We gotta find a thin wood. Yeah, I don't think I've ever chopped a tree before. -Or wood. -You were never in the boy scouts? Jews don't scout.

I did not faint. I'm gonna get a drink. I just want to mention again that, Kyle and I are in love so you don't get the wrong idea. I'm sure he'd be really proud to hear you say that. Why don't we play a new game where you're not allowed to lie. Okay. -You nervous? -A little bit. What is the last memory you have of not being totally alone? All right, you wanna me to tell you something or ask me a question? I don't know, tell me something. Tell me something you wouldn't tell somebody.

All the time. -What? -And, I have a really bad rash, and I just keep scratching it and it keeps getting worse and worse. I don't know what to do about it. You have more hair than I do. Are you sure about that? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Can I see it? The whole idea was to have people come and have their senses overwhelmed. But, with Kyle I'm sure will just turn into a sex party. You okay? That's really cool with the lights on. * I've got a thing * You've got a thing * Everybody's got a thing * When we get together Doing our things * * In order to help each other * In order to help a brother * You don't drink What I drink * * You don't smoke What I smoke * * You don't think What I think * * You don't joke Like I joke * * I've got a thing * You've got a thing * Everybody's got a thing * When we get together * Doing our thing * In order to help Each other * So what's up?

Okay. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Hey. You okay? Look at me. Can you look at me? Hey. Wake up. 911, what is your emergency? Hi, my friend won't wake up. She's barely breathing. Okay, tell me what happened? She ate a lot of hair. She what? Do you know the Heimlich? She's not choking, she swallowed it a while ago. Hang on okay. -This is Dr. Moony. Hey, what happens when you eat too much hair? Did you eat too much hair? Not me, my friend ate too much. You should tell your friend to stop because humans can't digest it, for one. It's difficult to even cough up like a cat fur for example. What happens? Well, if you eat too much, it forms a hair rock in your stomach. It'll grow and grow and eventually fill your entire stomach and head into your bowls and clog up your entire system. There can be emergency surgery if necessary. You have to cut it out? Keep her vital steady and we'll be there in a few hours. * It's the power * And the glory Why? Why? Shot's going in. - Pulse is faint. - Let's go. Clear the beads. Oh. Oh. Oh God. Oh God, are you okay? Are you... Where does it hurt? I don't know. Oh God, okay. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna get under here. I'm gonna take you to the hospital. Hmm, okay. You can't fall asleep, you could have a concussion or something. What's your name? Do you want some sugar slurpies? - No. You should eat vegetables, you know? Yeah? Can you, uh... sing me something? Right now? Yeah. Do you realize you could have been charged with man slaughter? And had you waited like any sane person, the only one to blame would have been us or her. So she's okay? More or less. She's got a rather terrible scar which I hope is a permanent reminder of a habit she needs to discontinue. Can I go see her? Not so fast. Where's the Chuck Beesor? The hair rug? I left it there, why? I've never seen one before. Hmm. Hi. Hi. * If you see me * On you doorstep right * You're love Was the look for me * * It was all that I had * And since You've taken it away I don't believe in men * * I remember the good times And I try not to be sad * * But I know that it's true That you will never love me Again * * So don't be surprised If you see me * * Lying on a railway track * Thank you for coming So eager * * Thank you for coming * There's a possibility That I'll submit To your military * * If I am wrong * For all the things I'm praying for you, somehow They don't come true * * We must go out * If I let you, I burned * To lay my hand On the bed I made * * Yes, I had * And I don't forever start * To get so close 'Cause you're so far * * If all the things I planned Is good for you * * Oh, you've got to Stand by me baby... * * To have a drink With me darlin' * * To hold on A little bit longer * * Have a little faith Have a little faith * * Have a little faith In me baby * * Friends of our Who criticize * * But they just don't realize That I'm all for you * * So in reality I'll be true * * If you could Just stand by me * * I'll be ture * * Have a little faith In my darlin' * * Hold on a little bit longer * Have a little faith Have a little faith * * Have a little faith In me baby * * Have a little faith In me darlin' * * Hold on a little bit longer * Stand by my side Won't you please baby *
