Gesher Multicultural Film Fund ﻿"I'll never forget you. ﻿You're everything I am. ﻿I'll never forget you. ﻿You're everything I am. ﻿You weep and I yearn, ﻿A film by David Kreiner ﻿When will happiness come? ﻿You weep and I yearn, הסוסיתא של הרצל "Shooting life" (Herzl's Susita) ﻿When will happiness come? ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Do you know how I get to Gottlieb High School? ﻿Keep going straight, turn left at the traffic circle, ﻿you'll see a jail in front of you. ﻿Okay. ﻿What's there? ﻿I'm teaching there. Uh-oh... ﻿You lose big-time. ﻿Get away while you still can. ﻿Thanks. ﻿You shooting? ﻿Have a nice trip. ﻿The problem is the time pressure. ﻿I don't know what she did with them but they've done no graduate projects. ﻿Make a list of what they have and don't have. ﻿and after class you'll have a safety briefing, okay? ﻿Actually... maybe you should have it now so if there's a red alert... ﻿I'll go get someone. ﻿12th grade, Class 3. ﻿Good luck. ﻿Thanks. Yes? ﻿No, they can come in. ﻿They shouldn't stand with the students, of course not. ﻿He's checking us out. ﻿Fresh from Poland. ﻿Are you taking Osnat's place? ﻿What kibbutz are you from? ﻿Amalia said he's from Tel Aviv. ﻿Are you a film director? ﻿An actor? ﻿Something like that? ﻿Can't you talk? ﻿Weren't you in... What was it called? ﻿"The Game of Life"? ﻿What's your name? ﻿-Ohad. -Ohad. ﻿Ohad, tell me three things you think you know about me. ﻿You want the truth? ﻿Nothing but the truth. ﻿The truth is, you're... ﻿50 years old. You're the type... ﻿who doesn't have a clue. Bored. ﻿Why bored? ﻿I dunno, what are you doing here? ﻿Come here. ﻿Can you come closer? -I'm not into that. ﻿Okay. This is an interview. ﻿Ask me whatever you want to know. -Okay. ﻿Honestly, what's up with the Crocs? ﻿Okay, keep going. ﻿What's the first thing you'd ask me ﻿if I were a girl you were interested in? ﻿Do you have a boyfriend? -No. ﻿Married? ﻿It's complicated. ﻿You don't listen, do you? Ask me anything. ﻿How often did you get beat up as a kid? -Plenty. ﻿So what's my story? ﻿Why do you think I care? ﻿I don't buy your indifference. ﻿-So don't. -I'm the story. ﻿I want to talk. You have to ask the right questions. ﻿About what? Your father? -For instance. ﻿Okay, when your dad hit you, ﻿did he just slap you around or did you end up in the hospital? ﻿Yes. ﻿I ended up in the hospital. ﻿Not just once or twice. ﻿Back then it was more common. ﻿You have to realize I was a troublemaker and he was... ﻿a man's man. ﻿From Germany. ﻿He hated disorder and noise and, most of all, waste. ﻿He hated it when we wasted electricity and water. ﻿One in the morning, ﻿everyone's asleep, ﻿and I feel like I'm suffocating. ﻿I can't breathe. ﻿I was an asthmatic kid and I didn't have an inhaler ﻿or any of that modern stuff. ﻿All I could think of was steam. ﻿To inhale steam ﻿so it would open up my... ﻿So I went to the shower and turned the boiling water all the way on. ﻿Suddenly I hear the door open and see him there with that... ﻿expression of his. ﻿He didn't say a word. I just said, "I can't breathe." ﻿And what does he do? ﻿Takes the hot water and aims it right at my face. ﻿My mom told me when I got to ER to say I spilled hot milk on myself. ﻿30 years later this is what remains. ﻿For real? ﻿Does it matter? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿What counts is the story, right? ﻿What do you mean, Teacher? ﻿It doesn't count if you're making it up. ﻿What I choose to talk about ﻿says something about me. ﻿Did you ever beat someone up? ﻿I want you to write a short story entitled: ﻿"Sderot." ﻿No more than one page, ﻿I suggest writing about something that happened here. ﻿Nothing happens in Sderot. It's boring as hell. ﻿Thinking more positively might help. ﻿Funny, Teacher. ﻿I'm not joking, I'm talking from experience. ﻿Keep your experience to yourself. ﻿Stop, stop, it's not working. ﻿What's wrong? That was good. ﻿Don't interfere. ﻿Why don't you try... ﻿That's good, right? ﻿"There are things, ﻿I wanted to say... ﻿Hey, sweetie, how are you? ﻿Maya? ﻿Is everything okay, honey? ﻿No. ﻿Sweetie, I don't know if we're allowed to talk. ﻿You didn't even bother to call... This text message. ﻿This has nothing to do with you. You know that, right? ﻿The army has bombed gaza strip, ﻿for the first time since "Pillar of defence" oparation. ﻿The airforce attacked to targets, ﻿one in the northern district and one in the eastern. ﻿Nothing to eat? ﻿Make it yourself. ﻿Tuli? ﻿Good morning, darling. -Hi, Mom. ﻿Well? ﻿What happened? -A waste of my time. ﻿Yeah, right... ﻿You haven't done a thing for months. ﻿They didn't even ask what I do for a living. ﻿They didn't even ask me my name. ﻿What are you doing? -What do you want? ﻿What's with the camera? -Leave me alone. ﻿Why are you filming me? -Leave me alone! ﻿Gimme the camera, you bastard! ﻿Don't lock the door on me, you little shit! ﻿Spy. ﻿He films me behind my back, the little shit. ﻿You're raising a spy! ﻿Hananya? ﻿Hananya? ﻿I know you can hear me. ﻿I can't handle your drinking and not working any more. ﻿I don't know what to do any more. ﻿I'm not coming home tonight. ﻿I'll sleep at the pool. Get some sleep. ﻿"Red alert". ﻿"Red alert". ﻿Let's go. Careful. ﻿Ohad, do you need a special invitation? Then move it. ﻿Tai! Stop that and go inside. ﻿Tai Ben Harush, get in there! ﻿Tai, come sit with us. ﻿Sit down. ﻿Folks, be quiet a second. ﻿Ohad. ﻿Homework: Film three minutes ﻿of an incident or a place ﻿that says something about you or your family. ﻿Give us a break, Teacher, can't you see we're shell-shocked? ﻿Then wake up and wake up fast. Stop complaining. ﻿I asked for silence. ﻿Be quiet! ﻿Unfortunately, we have instructions to let you all go home. ﻿Yes! ﻿Quiet! ﻿Please go straight home, this is no time to wander around. ﻿Okay? Now move it, in an orderly way. ﻿So this attack occurs ﻿after a missile attack that happened this morning. ﻿I'm going out tonight. ﻿If Dad hears... ﻿Now it's Dad and his bullshit? ﻿It's not bullshit, the missiles are reaching Ashkelon now. ﻿Where I go is none of your business. ﻿Here, I ironed it for you. ﻿Get that religious junk away from me. ﻿Don't want it? ﻿Okay, okay. ﻿How are you, sweetie? ﻿I just bought a camera for the computer, now we can Skype. ﻿Dad listen, I don't want to have a big birthday party. ﻿Why, what's the matter? ﻿Don't be angry, Dad. ﻿What's the matter? ﻿I don't want a party. ﻿You can have a small Bat Mitzvah, it doesn't have to be a big party. ﻿We can have it at the restaurant. ﻿Mom and Ilya are taking me to Moscow. ﻿A Bat Mitzvah trip to Moscow? ﻿Is that what you want, Maya? ﻿I wish i could travel with you instead. ﻿I won't let my daughter leave the country. I'll get a restraining order. ﻿It's not your decision. ﻿Oh, no? We'll see about that. ﻿We have 15 and 20 year olds living in this mess, ﻿it's crazy. ﻿But who can resolve it, Mayor Moyal? ﻿You say Gaza should be destroyed if necessary, but... ﻿Come here a sec. ﻿No. ﻿C'mon, get up. -I don't wanna. ﻿He wants you to ask a few questions so he can tell you ﻿how his granny raped him when he was little. ﻿What did you say? -You heard me. ﻿If you haven't figured it out, I teach filmmaking. ﻿This isn't Bible Studies or Literature where all you do ﻿is memorize dates and quote books. ﻿Here it's up to you, you can write about whatever you want. ﻿Why don't you film your lives? ﻿They're fascinating. -Our lives are boring. ﻿No, you're just lazy. ﻿Don't call me lazy. -What's so hard about filming something? ﻿It's surely more interesting than hanging out all day. ﻿What do you know about our lives? -Nothing, I want to find out. ﻿So far you aren't doing anything. -I don't have any ideas. ﻿When a fisherman goes to sea does he know if he'll catch anything? No. ﻿But he definitely won't catch anything if he doesn't try. ﻿Did you do your homework? -No. ﻿-Why not? -Leave him alone, he has a good reason. ﻿And what about yesterday? -Leave him... ﻿Libby, I didn't ask you. ﻿You come in late and you don't do homework. Please leave. ﻿Come with me to the principal's office. ﻿Move it. ﻿We have to get rid of him. ﻿You want to tell her? ﻿Tell her what you did. ﻿Yigal, I want to talk to you alone. ﻿Come in. ﻿Tai, you stay put. ﻿Hi. ﻿If you knew my dad got hit by a missile you wouldn't have kicked me out. ﻿Probably not. ﻿I should thank him. ﻿They've left me alone for three days now. ﻿Who? ﻿All those counselors and shrinks. ﻿I'd rather people wrote their problems on their foreheads. ﻿"I have an eating disorder." "My father beats me." ﻿It'd make things easier. ﻿The missile didn't even hurt him. ﻿He heard the siren, ran, and fell into the empty pool. ﻿He was plastered, as usual. ﻿I wonder how it didn't happen before. ﻿Do you visit him in the hospital? ﻿We do shifts. ﻿How about filming? -I'm in no mood for schoolwork. ﻿I didn't say schoolwork, I said go film your father. ﻿Ettie, should I let the factory know you aren't coming in? ﻿No, I'll be there. ﻿Stop it, Tai, honey. ﻿Put away the camera. ﻿Hey, hey, hey. What's the matter? ﻿It's no good, it's just... -It's really good! ﻿Keep going. ﻿It's good, don't go. ﻿He's got balls. ﻿Teacher, I'm gonna make an awesome movie today. ﻿Want it? ﻿No, thanks. Not hungry. ﻿Tuna salad, made it myself. It's good. ﻿Can you give me permission? -To do what? ﻿To stop filming. ﻿What's the matter? ﻿If I taught a 30-year-old filmmaking for five years ﻿he wouldn't come up with what you did in 3 minutes. ﻿That can't be taught. ﻿Then why make the effort? ﻿An artist has to be willing to show the world his work. ﻿To say: "This is me." ﻿Fearlessly. ﻿Excuse me, do you know where the drink machine is? ﻿No class today? ﻿Yes, there is. ﻿Just the two of us? ﻿Good. ﻿I want you to teach me to make a video clip of my new song. ﻿But it has to be killer, with lighting and everything. ﻿You must know people in the industry I could send a CD to. ﻿You know, connections. ﻿I'll think about it... ﻿What do you have against me? ﻿What? -You always give me long face. ﻿Me? -Yes, you. ﻿Is it the way I look? ﻿Don't be silly, you look great. -Yeah, Queen of the Nile. ﻿I don't know... ﻿maybe because of my daughter. ﻿You have a daughter? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Maya. She's 12. ﻿Where is she? ﻿In Tel Aviv, with her mother. ﻿So you're married? ﻿Divorced. ﻿Girlfriend? ﻿No. ﻿My sister has tons of friends looking for a husband. ﻿Once was enough. ﻿Why do you say that? ﻿Why make the same mistake twice? ﻿The trick is to learn from mistakes, not repeat them. ﻿It's not that simple. ﻿We Caucasians marry at 17 and have at least two kids by 20. ﻿So when are you getting married? ﻿Don't jinx me, Teacher. ﻿I'm not getting married before I'm 26 and certainly not to a Caucasian. ﻿You'll get married, all right. ﻿See, you do have something against me. ﻿You don't think I'm worth shit. ﻿I'll kill myself before I marry a Caucasian. ﻿Kill myself. ﻿Hey, Ohadie. Come give Grandma a kiss. ﻿That's the way. ﻿That's it, Yaffa. ﻿I'm finished with the towels. ﻿Want some coffee? -No, thanks. ﻿Didn't you say you're going to the market? ﻿Take him with you, he's in my way. ﻿Okay, I'm going. Need anything? -No, nothing. ﻿Maybe we should go later. ﻿Why? ﻿It's not... safe out right now. ﻿But I want to film you shopping. ﻿Okay, honey, we'll go later. ﻿Something tells me it's a bad idea. ﻿The danger's passed, Rosa, you can go now. ﻿Let's go, Ohadie. ﻿Coming? ﻿Excellent beginning. ﻿I'm wonder what's next. Who's that cop? ﻿You have a gift for capturing drama, not everyone does. Bravo. ﻿There are things I wanted to say.. ﻿But didn't get around to. ﻿I didn't dare dream of tomorrow.. ﻿I always gave in.. ﻿I want to be free... ﻿You let her hang out with boys? -Shut up. ﻿Where're you going? -Home. Are you following me? ﻿What're you doing with him, Yuli? -I said shut up. ﻿He's dickless. Faggot. ﻿Give him back the camera! -Hey! Careful with the camera! ﻿Tell him to give it back, Yuli! I'll tell Vaja on you! ﻿I won't marry you. ﻿Give 'em back the camera, it belongs to the school. ﻿School... -Beat it. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Let me speak to Maya. ﻿She doesn't want to talk to you. Stop harassing us. ﻿Please let me speak to Maya. ﻿I'm calling the police. ﻿Bitch. ﻿Hi. ﻿Hey. ﻿What're you doing here? Something wrong? ﻿I was supposed to go see my daughter in Tel Aviv, but... ﻿The roads are all blocked. -Oh, right, there's a demonstration. ﻿That's how it is here, you can't plan anything. ﻿I made reservations at a restaurant and everything. ﻿So leave your car and take a bus or a service taxi. ﻿You know how long the bus takes? ﻿Doesn't look like it's getting any faster, either. ﻿You could join me for dinner, I made pea soup. ﻿I worked in Special Ed at City Hall. ﻿They took me out to try to save Gottlieb ﻿but I didn't know what an odyssey I was getting into. ﻿Everyone there admires you. ﻿Is it admiration or fear? ﻿They're two different things. ﻿Fresh peas, from the farmers' market. ﻿How long have you been divorced? ﻿A year. ﻿A year is nothing. ﻿Seems like forever to me. ﻿Is that why you're here? Ran away? ﻿No, I didn't run away. ﻿I got divorced ﻿and came here for financial reasons. ﻿But they forgot to tell me there's no way out of here. ﻿Did they tell you the principal would make you pea soup? ﻿I think you're exploiting your authority. ﻿Red alert... ﻿Shit. ﻿Red alert... ﻿Get over here! ﻿Red alert... ﻿Libby. ﻿What's wrong ﻿Nothing. ﻿Libby, tell me what's wrong. ﻿Vaja took me to the military recruiting office ﻿to declare that I'm religious. I ﻿signed. ﻿I'm not enlisting. ﻿And now I'm stuck here. ﻿Think of it this way, ﻿you can... ﻿spend your time doing music instead of ﻿wasting it on the army. ﻿Just... ﻿go with your music. ﻿Libby. ﻿It's all right. ﻿Good morning, Teacher. -Good morning. ﻿Listen... -Save it, I want to start. ﻿Good morning, how are you? ﻿Listen, Teacher, I brought some footage, ﻿I did paralyzed editing... -Parallel. -Parallel. ﻿I need you to watch it, please. ﻿Okay, let's see. ﻿Elinor, the lights. ﻿Get that away from me! ﻿All these commercials... ﻿I'm so nervous... ﻿It's starting. -Oh. ﻿Here. ﻿I look awful. -You look awesome. ﻿With me is Yaffa Malka, Sderot's No. 1 hairdresser. ﻿"Sderot's No. 1 hairdresser." For heaven's sake. ﻿Yaffa, can you tell our viewers what's happening in Sderot these days? ﻿Honestly? ﻿The situation sucks. ﻿We're desperate. ﻿Look around. ﻿All the stores are empty. ﻿Nobody's earned a shekel for two weeks. ﻿I'm a hairdresser, but who needs a haircut in times like these? ﻿What do you think of your mom? TV star, huh? ﻿You should be the mayor's spokeswoman. -I should be the mayor. ﻿What do you say, Teacher? Isn't it brilliant? ﻿Cut to.. ﻿Everyone wants to be here while it's happening ﻿so they sleep here, eat here, ﻿but when the explosions stop, nobody cares. ﻿Nobody cares that we're exploding from within. ﻿Thank you, Yaffa. -Thank you. ﻿What do think about the editing? ﻿Did you see what I did? ﻿Turn off the camera, Ohad. ﻿Enough. ﻿Excellent editing. ﻿I caught Yossi red-handed. ﻿Do you have more footage of Yossi? -No way, ﻿when he saw the camera he switched channels ﻿like I caught him watching porn. ﻿What a joker. ﻿Interesting character. Keep filming him. ﻿What's your problem? Haven't you filmed enough? ﻿Yossi, get over to the old mall. ﻿On my way. ﻿I'm coming with you. ﻿Red tomatoes, ripe today! ﻿Stop shouting! Can't you see the kids are scared to death? ﻿He's driving me nuts. ﻿Stop shouting, Peretz. Enough already! ﻿Stop Shouting! You are scaring the kids! ﻿This is my living! -Move it. ﻿What's wrong with you? an hour ago ten died in gaza.. ﻿Go back to your store! Be quiet! -Cut it out! ﻿What's the matter with you? You nearly broke my window! ﻿I finally have some clients... ﻿What're you doing here? Don't you have school? ﻿Aren't there enough cameras around here as it is? ﻿Go home, I made you lunch. -But Mom... ﻿Don't "Mom" me, go home! ﻿Yossi, ﻿why are you dragging my son around? -Yaffa, it's him and his stupid film. ﻿I've had enough of you. Go home. ﻿Stop filming me. Now! ﻿Go mind your own business! Get back to your store. ﻿Get back to your store! ﻿What's up with Yossi and your mom? ﻿Why don't you shut up? ﻿Calm down, people. ﻿Ohad, ﻿who's Yossi? ﻿Nobody. ﻿A cop. ﻿A friend of his dad's. ﻿Can't you shut up? ﻿A friend of your dad's? -He was, Teacher. ﻿What happened to your dad? -None of your business. ﻿Folks, ﻿I didn't say you had to tell about yourselves. ﻿But if you are, ﻿take it all the way. ﻿Okay, ﻿who else has footage to show? ﻿Uh... me. ﻿Go ahead. ﻿Tai, honey, Dad needs to be cleaned. ﻿Maybe you should take the camera away. ﻿I'll just turn it off. ﻿You wipe him, I'll bring some more. ﻿Hello. ﻿Please, come in. ﻿Hello, 12th grade film majors. -Hello. ﻿I'm honored to be hosting a very important contributor from Miami, ﻿Mr. Jerry Michael. -Hi, everybody. ﻿Honorable Mayor Eli Moyal, whom you all know. ﻿This is our 12th grade film major and this is their director, Mr. Yigal Gazit. ﻿Hi. Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. ﻿Hello. ﻿Shalom, hello. ﻿It's very nice, I'm speaking... ﻿a little Hebrew? -It's okay, they all understand English. -Oh, good. ﻿Hello and goodbye. ﻿This footage is inappropriate but I don't have anything else. ﻿But he's very important, he donates a lot of money. ﻿I understand, but... -Show us the footage. -It's totally inappropriate. -Yigal, ﻿please continue your class, well just sneak a peek. ﻿It's okay, show us whatever you have. ﻿Come, please have a seat. Libby... -Please. ﻿Principal, it's personal footage. -What? ﻿I don't think we should... ﻿My parents... -Are you ashamed of your parents? ﻿You don't want to see it... -Fine, fine. ﻿Yigal, can you please begin? Thank you. Mom. ﻿What about what the doctor said? -I'm not interested. ﻿Mom, we can sell his body parts. -What? ﻿How can you say that? ﻿How much do you think well get for a liver? ﻿Or kidneys? ﻿Or a cornea? -What's the matter with you? ﻿Who put that into your head? ﻿Since when do they sell human organs? Are you crazy? ﻿Since he's unconscious, at least they'll get us out of this town. ﻿We deserve that at least, Mom! ﻿The liver is an important organ. ﻿There must be loads of northerners who'd be glad to buy Dad's liver. ﻿His liver may not be his healthiest organ... ﻿You have no respect for your father. ﻿That's your father lying there. Your father. ﻿Thank you. ﻿You know how long it took to calm Moyal down? ﻿Do you realize the damage you've done? ﻿His dad's in the hospital, he was hit by a missile. What do you want? ﻿You're lucky those Americans are so cynical. ﻿They'll contribute once they see the situation here. ﻿See? It's not so bad. -Yigal. ﻿This isn't Sderot Reality TV. ﻿These films have a purpose. This is a school. ﻿From now on, everything goes through me, is that clear? ﻿You mean censorship? -Yes. ﻿Censorship. ﻿They're 17, it's for their own good. ﻿I want them to make **their graduate films about love, ﻿with a message, with values, about Zionism. ﻿I want them to talk about the good things this town offers. ﻿Not missiles, anxiety and fear. ﻿ e have enough of that. ﻿Got it? ﻿Got it. ﻿Nobody can silence us! -Let's calm down a sec. -Calm down? ﻿Listen, friends. ﻿Amalia wants films about Zionism, with a message, right? -So? ﻿Let's write a screenplay for Amalia. -What? ﻿You're listening to her? -He didn't say that. ﻿But he's letting her step all over us. ﻿Let's make up a story about Zionism for Amalia. ﻿You can keep working on your films. What do you say? ﻿Well trick her. -Great idea. ﻿Pens and paper, everyone. ﻿"Pens and paper..." ﻿C'mon, c'mon. ﻿Everyone write down five things that come to mind ﻿when you hear the word "Zionism." ﻿The history teacher was just talking about Herzl and his brilliant idea ﻿io create a Jewish state here. -Really brilliant. ﻿Who's writing? ﻿Five things, five words, that's all. ﻿Can I write more than five? -The more the merrier. ﻿Is running away to Tel Aviv Zionism? ﻿It's the opposite of Zionism. -Why? ﻿Because anyone who runs away from Sderot is a damned coward. ﻿Zionism means staying here. ﻿So stay. Who's stopping you? ﻿Without you? What would I do here? ﻿Let's not waste time. ﻿Who's good at writing? I need a volunteer. ﻿Teacher, that's not exactly our strong point. ﻿But... Erez is good at writing. ﻿Ask anyone. ﻿His comedy sketches are hilarious. ﻿The geek is a genius. ﻿Can you help me? -What do I have to do? ﻿Write everything down. You'll see. ﻿Who wants to read what he wrote? ﻿Eran. ﻿Nothing special. I wrote: ﻿"Jerusalem forever, settlers, the Star of David, HaTikva (the national anthem)." ﻿That's it. ﻿Erez? ﻿I wrote: "Living in Sderot, democracy for all, ﻿"Bedouin on a camel, loving others, and my dad's Sussita (Israeli-made car from the '50s)." ﻿That's good! -Sussita! ﻿Sussita, that's excellent. Okay, okay, okay, ﻿now it gets interesting. ﻿What do you think of this opening sequence: ﻿Herzl, ﻿prophet of the State, ﻿is driving a Sussita. ﻿Where's he driving? -To Basel, to the Zionist Congress. ﻿Excellent! ﻿Where is he now? -Here, in the ravine outside Sderot. ﻿Boom! His radiator blows. -Excellent. ﻿Erez, you work on the screenplay, ﻿the rest of you carry on as usual. -Nice going, Teacher. ﻿You learned to talk, you turned into a 'hood. ﻿I have a surprise for you. shocked, aren't you? -What is it? ﻿Listen and find out. ﻿What a cutie. ﻿It's an old picture... ﻿Maya was nine there. ﻿Why don't you bring her here? Don't you miss her? ﻿Like crazy. ﻿Why would he bring her here? -Why not? ﻿'Cause it's a war zone, maybe? -Big deal. ﻿Hey, Roni. ﻿How are you? ﻿Yeah, I was looking for you. ﻿I have a favor to ask you. ﻿I have a student, ﻿a Caucasian singer. ﻿She's something else. ﻿I want to send you a disk with some of her songs. ﻿Roni, you've never heard anything like it. ﻿Thanks, Roni. Thanks. ﻿Okay, I owe you one. ﻿How'd you get your hands on his file? ﻿Yossi showed it to me. ﻿There's nothing in it. ﻿Just a few lines about a drug deal and a cop who disappeared. ﻿They even erased the date. ﻿There's something fishy going on. -Ohadie, just drop it. Mom. ﻿What, darling? How'd you meet Dad? ﻿No more questions. ﻿Just tell me how you met. ﻿He was a young cop from Beersheva ﻿who showed off to all the girls here. ﻿And your grandparents wanted someone to run ﻿Grandpa's business, not some cop. ﻿Anyway, I had the coolest car in town. ﻿Even then I was crazy about cars. ﻿So your grandpa bought me the Citroen that jacks up when you start it. ﻿And one day ﻿the car disappeared. ﻿Now, everyone had their eye on it. ﻿I had no choice, I went to the station and filed a complaint... ﻿and he was waiting for me. ﻿Two hours later I had the car back. ﻿He never admitted it, but I guarantee you he stole it. ﻿Do you miss him? ﻿Why do you ask? -I just... ﻿wonder. ﻿All these years, ﻿with everything we're going through, not one phone call. ﻿Or letter. ﻿Nothing. ﻿As if the earth swallowed him up. ﻿You ask me if I miss him? ﻿I told you, I don't know. ﻿Two years and not a trace. ﻿I'll tell you the truth. ﻿Word is, he found himself ﻿Everyone who knows him, including your mom, ﻿was surprised he got married and moved to Sderot. ﻿Ohad, I'm sorry to break it to you, ﻿but he won't be coming back. ﻿He didn't disappear. ﻿He decided to leave for good. Some people are like that. ﻿They wake up one morning, drop everything and move on. ﻿Hey. -Hi. see you're a regular here. ﻿I'm looking for a bedpan for my mom. -I'll show you where they are. ﻿You sure this is okay? -Don't worry about it. ﻿Here. -Good thing you're here. ﻿Stop in and visit. ﻿Which room? -18, in Orthopedics B. ﻿Cool, I'll come visit. ﻿Come. Dr. Ohayon is waiting. ﻿As of now, his organs are healthy, ﻿but within a few days his bodily systems are liable to collapse. ﻿I see, Doctor. ﻿No chance he'll wake ﻿Why wake him up? ﻿Don't start that again, TaL ﻿You want me to let someone know? ﻿No. Don't tell anyone. ﻿Why not? ﻿I don't think I'll sign. ﻿But there are sick people waiting. ﻿And if he wakes up today? Tomorrow? ﻿He won't. ﻿How do you know? ﻿Mom, ﻿do you want him to wake up? ﻿I don't know. ﻿Maybe when he wakes up he'll change. ﻿I've heard about people ﻿who came out of a coma changed. ﻿People don't change, Mom. ﻿Look at me. ﻿What? ﻿People don't change. ﻿Getting cold, isn't it? -No, it's a nice breeze. ﻿Check out Yigal's Crocs. ﻿How are you? ﻿Roni the agent called me yesterday. ﻿He's very impressed. He wants to meet you. ﻿They might even... ﻿audition you for a military band. ﻿She can't join the army. ﻿Why not? ﻿She declared... -I declared that I'm religious. ﻿What? ﻿My dad won't let me enlist. ﻿Want me to talk to him? -No, it's too late. ﻿You can't give up, Libby. ﻿You can go to the Recruitment Office and ask to enlist. -How? ﻿I'll take you on an outing to Tel Aviv. ﻿Bring your friends, go to the Recruitment Office, ﻿say you want to enlist, that your parents forced you to declare. ﻿That's crazy, Teacher. -You're allowed to change your mind. ﻿Tell them you're not religious any more. I've had students who did that. ﻿It's up to you, Libby. Be assertive, be tough. ﻿Don't give up your dream. ﻿I don't get it. So you lied? You're not really religious? ﻿Not any more. -Do you realize lying is a felony? ﻿I stopped being religious, I said. ﻿I want to join a military band. I don't care which, z ﻿I don't want to be a secretary or close to home. ﻿Is that final? ﻿Don't come complaining to me. -It's final. ﻿Write that I'm highly motivated. ﻿I'm going to check out glasses. ﻿No, Libby, we won't be able to find you. ﻿-I'll be in here. -Okay. C'mon, you guys. ﻿What do you say, Teacher? ﻿Makes you look cool. ﻿Don't make fun of me. ﻿Maya, why are you running away? -Yigal, let go ﻿or I'll call the police. -I just want to say hello. ﻿-Maya, get over here, ﻿he's dangerous. -Dangerous? I just want to say hello. ﻿I hate you. I never want to talk to you again. Stop calling me. ﻿You aren't my father! ﻿-Maya, what's going on? I love you, ﻿I miss you, you don't take my calls. Come here. ﻿You want me to talk to her? ﻿She brainwashed her. It's a lost cause. ﻿Libby! Libby, don't bother... ﻿Do you like this? ﻿Take it.
