When the wind blows, it also blows in your heart. How can you feel the wind blowing in your heart? The Wind in Your Heart Hello? Hello? Hello? Yes? Could it be...? Yes. He'll be waiting, then. They'll send a tow truck right away. It's been 23 years... ...hasn't it? Yes. Have you been living here the whole time? No. I lived in Tokyo for a while... and moved here five years ago. My husband grew up here. I see. Are you here on a trip? No. I'm visiting a friend while I do some work. I've been here for a couple weeks. I see. Do you remember? Yes. Here we are... ...again. The fan belt's loose here. The fan belt? - I'll fix it. - I'll let you work, then. I knew this would happen. It's been a while since I drove it. Good thing you're not leaving today. Ryosuke! Are you listening? Oh, sorry. I know you don't have much time, but aren't you pushing it a little? You're not feeling well. I'm fine. How's the car? No problem. He said it's nothing big. That's an amazing coincidence! That beat-up truck did you a favor. Seems so. Reunited with your first love in a distant place, after 20 years. It's destiny. Can you call it anything else? Think about it. We were roommates in London. Then I moved here, and you came to visit. And then that old truck broke down close to her house. All of that happened to create this one coincidence. Why do you think this coincidence happened,then? A coincidence... - ...is just a coincidence. - That's not it! Destiny is trying to bring you together again. Quit being a curator and write novels instead. It is like a novel, isn't it? How was it, meeting her again? Did you feel the same way about her? You're so easy to read! I'm jealous. Thank you. I'd given up on love a long time ago. What was love all about, anyway? She just shrugged! Your wife would be sad to hear that! That's different! It's not the kind of love that makes your heart race. You don't have much time, why not throw yourself into it? Knowing you, you probably never got anywhere back then, either. Enough, let's eat. I'm sorry to make you wait. It's fine. I found something to film, so I didn't mind. Oh, wow! We can go in my car, if you'd like. The last time we met... was at Mihana train station, right? It was when you left for Tokyo. I didn't realize it would be... our last day. I didn't have any other choice back then. My family had a lot to deal with. I heard later that you'd had trouble. But I still thought you'd contact me one day. You'd just started college. I didn't want you to worry. You couldn't talk to me? I'm sorry. Is your wife in London? I'm still single. I see. I thought you must be married already. Most people would think that. I'm getting on in years, after all. Isn't your mother worried, then? How are your parents? That day... I lost everything. Why did only I survive? I left Japan without a second thought. Now six years have already gone by. We've both been through a lot. By the way, what are you filming? So this is how it looks through the camera. Like an abstract painting. Made by time and by chance. Yes, it is. No one could make it look like this on purpose. The color of this rust is beautiful. The coloring over here is like the wind is blowing. Like a field of sunflowers... Working hard, eh? Hello. Are you heading home? It's looking like rain. Here with your wife? Er...well. See ya. Take care. Here. Amazing... The picture is changing in the rain. It's like the past is meeting the present. Through this rain. Maybe we should take shelter? Oh, right Just a second. Let's wait in here. Oh, thanks. Please use this. It's really coming down. Yes, it is. It's that flower. I was just thinking the same thing. Strange... 23 years have passed but it doesn't feel like it at all. Then... Let's turn back time, to our high school days. Haruka. I'm truly glad to see you again. I've always wanted to see you again, even just once. I wondered how you were doing, sometimes. I thought... you would become an artist. And I was right. It's all thanks to you. Me? I was writing to please you. I took photos for you... And wrote songs for you... I just get paid for it, now. You made a song for me back then. You remember it? I don't remember how it went but I remember you singing it. Spring arrives on a gentle breeze It wraps me in your fragrance Your bright smile is like sunlight I want to protect it always and forever Together alone with our hands entwined Our hearts pray for time to stop Your bright smile is like sunlight I will protect it always and forever Hello? Sure. I can talk. Daddy? He'll visit you when he gets back. Grandma said she might, too. I'll ask again. I'll visit next week, so let's celebrate then. Okay. Talk to you later. Your daughter? Yes. Her name's Yoko. She just moved to Sapporo on her own. She's that old? You married pretty young, then. She's a freshman in college. Next week is her birthday. She was so small 19 years ago. You must be proud of her. She's everything to me. And your husband? He's in Taiwan for work. What's he like? Well... I'm not really sure. I should go home. I thought we might have dinner together... I have to eat at home. That's right... Thank you for coming along today. I had fun too. Have a safe trip, then. Haruka. Can we meet again tomorrow? It's my last day here. I have volunteer work tomorrow. I'm sorry. Let's meet after that. Even if it's late. Give me a call when you're done. Here's my number... No thank you. I'd rather not know it. I don't think it's a good idea. Then... I'll wait here. Until you come. Wasn't today enough? What would be the point? There's no point! I just want to see you. That's enough. I really enjoyed today. I was happy. That's more than enough. Grandma? Dinner's ready. Why so dirty? You're not a farmer. Curry again. I could've gotten groceries while I was out. Sorry. Today was a bit busy. I'll be away at a reunion tomorrow. I'll spend the night at Yoko's. I see. Let's wait in here. It's that flower. I was just thinking the same thing. What's wrong? Something happen? No. Your drinks are ready. Thank you. You said you wanted to write picture books, back then. I loved picture books, at the time. You can still start now. You live in such a picturesque place. I can't. There's no fairy tale left in me. I'm just a middle-aged woman living in the countryside. A middle-aged picture book writer living in the countryside. Sounds nice. Oh, hush... You were a musician, weren't you? You said you heard music notes when you looked at people. I was the note G. I couldn't explain it, though. Do you still hear it? That's a good question... I guess I've aged. Just a second. That really touched my heart. I never thought that I could inspire you to play music. I didn't know that I would play it again, either. I thought that innocence was only in the past. But it lives on in music. It'll never fade away. I'm envious. You've got talent, and the strength to chase your dreams. I'm envious of you. A husband and a sweet daughter... You've got a family that needs you. Aren't you happy? Well... I'm not sure. Why don't you get married? It's not that I don't. I just can't. How come? You're the cool, romantic type. You must be popular. Must be something wrong. With you? A narcissist in his own world, expecting too much. Aren't all artists like that? My expectations are too high because of you. You can lower them now, then. You see what I look like now. You really haven't changed. You don't know yourself. You were so popular back then. You never knew how much I fought to keep you. You haven't changed. You're special, Haruka. Hang on a sec! It's the wind and the sun... embracing each other. Embracing? When you watch them... don't you think they're whispering sweet nothings to each other? The wind is the man and the sun is the woman. And? What? You could write it. The story of the wind and the sun. Oh, stop that. What's wrong? Nothing, just resting. You okay? What'd you get? I even bought dessert. That side's a little stiff. You're filming the wind. We can see the wind everywhere, when we look closely. Like what? The leaves. The flowers. The sound of the wind. The smell of the wind. The shape of the wind... Its sound... Its smell... What else is there? There's a saying. If you propose on a windy day, you will succeed. Really? When the wind blows, it also blows in your heart. The wind in your heart. How can you feel the wind blowing in your heart? Because your heart flutters. How do you film that, then? By filming your eyes. So beautiful. Hey! What's going on here? Are we not allowed here? Absolutely not. This is private land. You're trespassing! Hurry up and get out! Sorry about that. Sorry. It's not your fault. But we should have checked first. That was wrong of us. You're as serious as ever. Serious? You always followed even the smallest of rules. We fought over that a lot. We did? I don't remember that. Especially about my curfew. Don't you remember? That wasn't fighting. Just playing around. What? I was taking it seriously. But now I've gotten too serious. It's good to be serious. What's the problem? It might sound good to others, but it's boring. We grew up, after all. Being a wife and mother meant I had to be even more serious. Serious wife, serious mother. Sounds good to me. But it's like something's missing. That's how I feel. Is it? This is your last day, right? Aren't you going to film today? I'll be your assistant. My serious assistant? All right. Over this way. Wow! Thanks. It's beautiful. Sorry, Ikeno. I can't go tonight. I'll go in the morning. Oh, just this and that. Talk to you later. What time is your flight tomorrow? Around noon. No time left, huh? There's one more spot I wanted to show you. Where? Have you heard of Blue Pond? It's a beautiful, brilliant blue pond. I'm sure you'd like it. All right. Let's go. It's a little too far. It will get dark soon. Shall we wait for dawn? The sun rises pretty early. Will you stay with me until then? I always have one lit. It shows me the wind. It's not much, but make yourself at home. - Um... - What... You first. What coffee is this? It's very good. It's Ethiopian. I brought it from London. You like it? Yes. It smells good. You must be tired from running around all day. Rest a bit. I'll wake you up. It's okay, you drove all day. You sleep first. I'll wake you. I can sleep on the plane tomorrow. I'll be fine, too. Welcome. - Here. - Thanks. It's beautiful. So many stars. If only we could see the aurora. You still like it, huh? Isn't it pretty bright in the UK? Haven't you seen it? No. I kept my promise. You made me promise to see it with you. I'll let you off the hook. So go and see it. By myself? If you see it, I'll say I did, too. I can't go alone. You should see it together... With the next person you love. No, with the person I'll always love. It's such a mesmerizing blue. It really is beautiful. Almost mystical. Why do beautiful things... always make me feel so sad? Because it'll disappear soon. Beautiful things always do. Nothing lasts. When I first came here... I wanted to dive in. To slowly sink into the water. Had something happened? No. I just wouldn't have minded disappearing with that beauty in my heart. It's like that movie. What movie? About a hairdresser and her loving husband. After making love one day, the hairdresser drowns herself. Why? She was happy. She wanted that happiness to last forever. A happy ending. Do you believe in reincarnation? I don't know. But... I believe there's another world beyond our knowledge. Then... If we exist in that world... Will we meet again? We will. We'll fall in love like this again. No, not like this. We can't do this again. Something has to change. If we repeat the same love again... It can't end like this. Your friend seemed lonely. You didn't see him yesterday. He'll be fine. I'll come again. When? Well... When I miss you. I'd have to come every day, then. I want to see you every day. Ryosuke... I want to be with you. I'm sorry, Haruka. Haruka! I love you. Haruka! How'd you know I didn't go to Sapporo? Oh, Yoko must've told you! Man, I'm jealous. My wife told me to take the bus. Come have lunch. You like her cooking, don't you? - I'll take the bus. - No, I'll drive you home. Hey! Hurry up! I had a drink on the plane, so can you drive? "When Wind Meets Coincidence" "Wind, Sun, Sound, Color" "The Wind Embraces" "The Meeting of Past and Present" Feb. 2017 - Passed away in London, UK He wasn't as healthy as he thought. So... his condition got worse? But it seems that wasn't all. He died at a lake in northern Scotland. Maybe he was too caught up in filming... He's the only one who knows. I scattered his ashes there, according to his will. But whether he knew he was going to die... is beyond me. Ryosuke.
