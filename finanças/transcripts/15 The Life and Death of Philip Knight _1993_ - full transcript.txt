[BELL RINGING] One, two, three, four. Mr. Dowdell? This way, please. [MUSIC PLAYING] Da. Duck? No thanks. Simon? No thanks. Philip? Manners, Philip. - Yes, please. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BOOM] Lift his ear up. [INTERPOSING VOICES] How's his face look? Like a pizza margarita, Jack says. Trust Phil to find a different way of lighting a fire. Is that Liz? So are you coming down? - Day after tomorrow, hopefully. - [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah. Look at you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Look, Liz. Silly. Mom and dad will be back in a minute. Mom and dad will be back in a minute. Get down on you'll bust something. And you'll have mom on you again. Make me. Stop playing silly buggers. [FART NOISES] Get down, you [INAUDIBLE]. Philip, you OK? Mountain eagle, this is base, receiving. Mountain eagle, five seconds to countdown. Five, four, three, two, one, engage. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Get off. And the rest of you, out. Everybody out. What the hell is going on in here? [SHATTERING] What the hell is he doing? Shopping for Mother's Day? I never had this trouble with the others. Oh Jack, never with Tim. Never with Elizabeth, never with Simon. I can't believe you would do this. Stealing the school video, oh, whatever next. Is this what we deserve? You are making us feel-- [INAUDIBLE] on my face. And your father, you father in tears when he heard. We'll sort something out. [CLINKING] [THUD] You going to wish me luck, then? You'll bloody need it. - Fuck off. - Fuck off yourself. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mom. Where have you been? I drew this. Very nice. Why don't you draw something yourself instead of always copying them? I drew it for you. Look at me when I'm talking to you. I asked you how you'd feel if your mother ran off and left you on your own. Don't know. You'd feel bloody upset is how you would feel. Do you know how many policemen we've had looking for you tonight? And your mother and father worried sick about you. Look at how you're upsetting your sister. Is that how you pay them back, by running away? After all your parents have done for you. You don't deserve parents like them. Philip, come on. Did you take it or not? No. Well, what about this [INAUDIBLE].. [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE]. Well, he says he's had trouble with Philip stealing from him. What? He never said. Didn't want you bothered with it. But it's bound to come up after this. He reported a stolen ceremonial sword and some cash from her purse. Well, he never said. He would have said. No, no, no, there must be some mistake. I'm sorry. I can't [INAUDIBLE]. Margareth. Mrs. Knight. Yeah, but his teachers are saying get him out. And the parents are screaming they'll take us to court if we-- No, no, look, forget the court threats. What we need to know is-- what I want to know is, what's the kid-- what's the kid telling us? If there's any doubts by now, all I saw when he came in here was this blank, you know, this grimace like he's saying keep out all the time. Now that is not a happy child. If you even suspect the parents, then we owe it to the child to push for the police of safety. I've tried to talk to the sister. Sister? Yeah, well get her back here for a meeting if you have to, but don't hang about. OK. Good. Right, now next? Philip Knight. [INAUDIBLE]. See, I've been having trouble with my back on and off. Well, sometimes I'm in agony with it. On and off for years. And then there's [INAUDIBLE] because he's waiting to go in for an operation. And then Philip's going on, and on, and on, that it's making me sick. Jack said to me the other day, you said, he's showing no regard for you whatsoever. Yes, I did. When your own son steals from a neighbor, someone you've known for years, well, that was too much. I said to Jack, that's it, Jack. I can't cope. That's when we went to see you. So, where's Philip now? He's in here. Philip? This is David. Hi. David's the social worker I told you about. He's here to talk to you about the problems you are having with your parents. I'll leave you to it. What's it like here? It's all right. Bit stuck up, isn't it? He definitely wants to stay at home. How does he come across? Shy, messy. [INAUDIBLE] with the social skills, maybe. But he's a smart kid. Be a right bugger if he wanted to [INAUDIBLE].. Do get down from there. You're not a baby anymore. You'll break something. Philip. Why do you always have to push me? We've got to find out. We can't. Who says? I bet we can't. Oh, shut your face. Fuck off. I'm going to find out who she is. Could be dead. She isn't. How do you know? She isn't. What if your real mom didn't like you? She would. Anyway, who are you going to ask? You don't know. I can find a different one. Anyway, at least I'm not a bloody cook in a bloody army cooking for wankers. It's better than being stuck at home. [PHONE RINGING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way. [INAUDIBLE] Could you hold on for a second, please. - He's adopted. - Who? Philip. Yeah. [INAUDIBLE] All our children are adopted, Mr. Dowdell, Timothy, Elizabeth, Simon, and Philip. We'll have all this on file, but some how old would Philip have been when you adopted him? Oh, he would have been-- Six months. She fought it. Sorry? The mother. What, she tried to get him back? Oh, it was terrible. She was getting rid of him to give him a better life, she said. Then she turns round and tries to get him back. Of course, we had no idea who the father was. A caravan in a field. No place for a baby. How long was it before that was sorted out? Oh, not long, maybe after that first Christmas we went to court and finished it. After that, she left us alone. She called around here, shouting and swearing [INAUDIBLE] have him back. I was sick with it, terrible time. But you were satisfied with the outcome. Well, we won the court case, didn't we? Right. It's something. I don't know. It's like they're holding back on something. Do you think there's abuse? No, no. Unless it's emotional. No, it's not that. It's something else. Anyway, they've-- the family have agreed to see the [INAUDIBLE] for assessment. Oh for God's sake, that's Tony talking, isn't it? I thought we got beyond all that? I'll tell you what I'd do if I was you. I'd go and get his original adoption file out of the castle. I bet you it's a screwed adoption that's at the heart of this. I got the feeling that the father is not sure about letting him go as his mom is. Maybe we can get him to-- Yeah, we could persuade him to intervene. You think the father would stand up for the boy against his own wife? I think so, yeah. I said you could watch it if you behave yourself. Now go to your room. - You said I could watch it. Dad, she said I could watch All Creatures. Philip, go to your room. Do as your mother says. She's not my real mom. I want to see my real mom. That's enough. I want to see my real mom. You're not my real mom. Stop it. Jack. Philip, you go to your room. I fucking hate you. I hate you. [INAUDIBLE]. [CRYING] Do something. Well, they said that they were going to fix it, for him to see a child psychiatrist. I want him to see a proper doctor. Promise me he'll see a proper doctor. But you see, a psychiatrist can find out what his problem is. I want a proper doctor. All right, lovey. All right. Well. All doctors said was he's not mentally ill. What good is that to us? We can't cope. We need help. Maybe what the doctor meant was thinking of Phil's problems-- But he is a problem. He's too much for us. Nobody's saying he's a saint, Mrs. Knight. But from Phil's point of view, it's far better if you see the sticky patch through as a family. We'll you'll have to do something while Jack's in hospital. I can't cope with Philip on my own. We can work something out-- What about emergency foster, you do that, don't you? No. I'm sorry, it is not in Phil's best interest to be taken into care. The emphasis right now should be on him staying at home with you and working this out, in David's words, as a family. Yeah? Oy, come back here you little bastard. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here he is. Hope everything goes well for you, Philip. See you some time. Behave yourself. Philip? Breakfast's ready. We'll be downstairs. Morning, [INAUDIBLE]. Good morning, everyone. Did you know that Philip Knight was taken into care at the weekend. What? [INAUDIBLE]. What the hell is going on? Right. Now listen, I don't care what your instructions were, you never, never make decisions about moving kids out of their homes without consulting either me or Joe. You have just done in 48 hours what we've been trying to avoid for the last two bloody weeks. You moved Philip out without proper warning and he's going to think you're punishing him. He's going to say, why are they moving me? Because I'm bad. Which is exactly what we're trying to avoid. But he'd run away again. His mother couldn't cope. She was insisting. Whatever. You've got my number. I don't care if it's the middle of the weekend. I don't care if it's the middle of the night. You ring me, OK? [WAVES CRASHING] You know it's not your faults about having to [INAUDIBLE] so sudden. Things are a little bit muddled. It's just till dad has his hip done, then I'm going home. Something your dad said? Philip? No, Jack. I know how much you care. I've seen you with him. There are good things here, things you, as a family, can build on. No, don't do this. Look, I know little bugger has been. I'm not saying it's easy. But think what this means if you close the door is the end of something irreplaceable for Philip and for you. So she can't cope. [INAUDIBLE] Look, forget about your wife for a minute. Is that what you want, Jack? Look, don't you people see? It's over. She can't cope. And that's that. That's that. All right? I-- I just can't. I can't. She-- she can't cope. So that's that. OK, Jack. I understand. I'm sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING] Philip, put that down. I said, put that down. [CRASH] Come back here. [MUSIC PLAYING] I've got a call from [INAUDIBLE].. Will you accept the charge? Who is it? Mom. It's a young boy. He won't give his name. Where is he? Phil. What are you doing here? I lost my money. Do your foster parents know you've gone? You better come in. Tom is staying. You know I'll have to ring home. Let's have a sip. That's a 650. No, no, he's fine. Dad, I think he'd really like to come home. No, I-- OK. I know. OK. I'll make sure. The thing is, Phil, you're not a baby anymore. It isn't just-- Mom's not going to take you back just like that. Why not? You've been in a lot of trouble, Phil. I'll stop, I will. You say that and then you always get in trouble again. I won't this time. I want to go back. It's not as easy as that. Why? Why isn't it? Because. Remember when mom was in hospital? She came home and you just stayed by her bed all day and all night, wouldn't leave her? If you loved her so much then, why are you so bad to her now? I do love her. Well anyway, it's different now. You've got new foster parents now. I hate it there. You've got to try and think of it as home, Phil. It isn't home. Home's with mom and dad. You've got to try. Why? Come on. It's time you were asleep. I've got the social worker picking you up a 8:00. I could live with you and Tom. Come on. Liz. I'll see you in the morning. REPORTER: The [INAUDIBLE] and Lambeth councils received a full reports on her death. A joint report due to be published tomorrow claims that Julian Langford, the social worker assigned to Doreen's case, was inexperienced, untrained, and reluctant to take the case on. But that criticism extends to the overall management of child abuse cases, blaming poor relations between social services officers and what they term a difficult working climate. [INAUDIBLE] MP Simon [INAUDIBLE],, says that social services should have taken action. SIMON: A child at risk from birth should not be allowed to remain behind closed doors. [INAUDIBLE] could have taken that child away from his parents, they didn't, the child died. I think that's evidence in itself. What the hell are you doing? Nothing. My cash card's gone. Did you take it? I said, did you take my cash card? I never. I'm missing 100 quid from my account. And you are the only one that could have found my number. Right, that's it. No, they've had enough. No. No. No one else is going to look after him. No. Right, I'll take those. All right, sorry to keep you waiting, chaps. [INAUDIBLE]. Right. Hello, Philip. My name is Steven Hill. I've been appointed as your solicitor for the care proceedings. I'm here to help you decide what to do. Do you know what a care order is, Philip? Well, a care order is when, well, to put it simply, it's when the social workers become your legal parents. Now, you have the choice as to whether to oppose that care order or not. And that's what you and I have to discuss. Now, are you with me? Good. Just along to the left. [INAUDIBLE]. Call Chris [INAUDIBLE]. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Nothing to do with you. Steady, steady. Up we go. Go on. Take it easy, son. Take it easy. Give him a cigarette. So you can make yourself tea and coffee in this area. [INAUDIBLE] corner. Excuse me, Harry. And through here is our common room. We've got pinball and a pool table. There seems to be some sort of committee meeting at the moment. And through here is our TV lounge. Gross. Now, this is the oldest part of the building. Showers, hi, Caroline. Bathroom. And this is the girls' changing room. [INAUDIBLE] interested there, would you? And this is the laundry room, washing, ironing, all that stuff. Come and catch me. Come and catch me. Come and catch me. Come and catch me. Listen, [INAUDIBLE]. Now, where was I? Yes, after many, many years of this sorrow, this slavery, in utter desperation, she decided that she would contact her brother, her big brother, [INAUDIBLE]. So a little starling that she trained-- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. I have just told David that we have found community parents for him. We did, but they dropped out. There's a couple in training now, could be right for him. We've got to be sure, Carol. Can you imagine how Philip would feel if he was rejected by another family? How long? A couple of months, maybe three. I am only employed 18 hours a week. I've got to train and interview them, get referees, police checks, write reports. And in the meantime, what do we do with him? You tell me. I don't run Philip's case, Ken, your office does. I have told you, I am in favor of community parents. Well, you may be, but the blokes at Cartref most certainly are not. Now, if you're asking me what I'd do if I could, I'd have Philip out of Cartref tomorrow. He's going nowhere there. Look, I hear what you're saying, Margaret, but I have to decide. I mean, what if he was to harm someone while he's in our care, I mean outside in the community. The press would have a field day. You know that. I don't have to tell you that. He's far more likely to hurt himself. I've got the bloody police inspector in Camaden telling me the boy's a liability. I'm on your side, Margaret. But my position is-- I am trying to hold a lot of very different opinions together. So just bear with me. [CRASH] [GRUNTING] That's a real talent you've got there. [MUSIC PLAYING] Where'd you learn to paint like that? Home. Ken, ginger nuts? Lovely. David? Margaret? You were saying? He's too disruptive. He's no different to any kid who's lost his parents. He just needs a family. In my experience, Margaret, and I think I do know my job, what young Philip needs is proper assessment. And that's precisely what he's getting here. Got a fag? No, I'm sorry. This was only ever meant to be temporary. We agreed, Philip is going to professional community parents. That you haven't even found yet, let alone trained? Philip needs assessment now. He's seen a shrink, Roger. He found nothing wrong with him. The last thing Philip needs right now are any more experts, making him feel like a walking, talking problem. Hello, Philip. I'm Dr. Randall. What do you think of it here? I saw some of your drawings this morning. They're very good. Got a cigarette? No, I don't smoke. You can have one after. Tell me first a bit about your family. Philip. [INAUDIBLE] When was the last time you saw your mom and dad, Phil? Last week. You met them last week. He means he just saw them, spent the night in the next door's garage. His dad saw him leaving. Is that what happened, Phil? Dunno. Do you miss your parents? Well, are you sorry about what's happened? They'll take me home soon, mom and dad. We've got to stop dodging this issue. We've got to deal with the fact and we've got to deal with it today. This boy just can't accept that he's not going home. Mom and dad, I'm sorry for what's happened Mom and dad, I'm sorry for what's happened and for all the trouble I've caused you. [SIRENS] Oh, hello. Hello there, Mark Randall. How do you do? Thank you for coming. This way. Thank you. Are they both going to be there? Yes. I knew they would. I wrote to them. There they are. Well, Philip. We've got something to tell you and we don't think you're going to like it very much. But this is the way things worked out. You see, dad and I feel we just can't handle your behavior anymore. Neither of us are very well at the moment and we feel we just can't cope with you. And you behavior hasn't improved at all and we were hoping that it would have done. So we think that the best thing to do is that you don't come home anymore. But I want to come home. Maybe when you're older. See, Dr. Randall told us it's like a church. And you can be a member of a church all your life. You don't have to go there. And you-- the church is there all the time, even if you're not there. No. David. Yeah? My real mom, can you find her? I'm not sure where we'd start, Phil. That's a long time ago. Listen, there's something I need to tell you. That's it. It's all right. There you go. Doing all right. Can we come back and see how he's doing? Yeah. Listen, about what I was saying. I'm going to-- I'm going to be leaving after Christmas. It's not immediately. I'll be about for a bit and there'll be someone else taking over, it's a girl called Kate Hawkins. You'll like her. She's very nice. Like I said, it's not straight away. You know? We'll take it slowly. Phil, this is Kate Hawkins, the new social worker I was telling you about. Hello. Hello. Right, well I'll leave you two to get to know each other. You know where I am if you want me. How do you like it at Cartref? [LAUGHING] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Stan, his parents have just rejected him. He's just lost his social worker. now I'm trying to build a relationship with this boy. Now you're telling me he's grounded. All right, all right. Well, what do you want me to do? Tell him it's OK to abscond four times in a row? It's my responsibility to give this boy some sense of order. And it's my responsibility to get him back into a family. I've got foster parents lined up to meet him. That was the whole bloody point of this day out. Look, there's no way that boy is ready to go back into a family. The only reason he came here was to find a foster parent. He was never meant to stay here. Kate, I'm just trying to do my best for the boy. I know, Stan, but you're not helping. Neither are you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sh, it's me. What are you bloody doing scaring me like that? You're waking mom up. Shut the window. Stiff as a fucking post. My room's bigger. Where? Home. You can't go home. Give us one, then. What? You. You climb that pipe. It's easy. Bloody scared me. Don't. What? - I'm not doing it here. - Why not? I don't want to. Your elbow. I'm not. Did David ever get anywhere with Philip's adoption file? No, I think he was blocked. See if you can get it. I want to know Philip's story. Right, Philip Knight, there you are. Thanks. Thanks. Shit. Don't panic. [INTERPOSING VOICES] - Come on. - What? Let's go. What? Ow, [INAUDIBLE] do with it. What? Your bloody hands are freezing. Ready? I'm not a piece of [INAUDIBLE]. Kiss me. Right at the end. Sit there. That make you proud, does it? She wanted to. What? She said she wanted to. That's not what she's telling us. The only reason you're not being charged with underage sex is because we know how hard Roger and [INAUDIBLE] are working at [INAUDIBLE] to help you. That's a lot of people making a lot of effort for you and you don't seem to be repaying them, except by nicking fags and having sex with underage girls. Is that clever? Didn't hear you. No. No, it's not clever. You can't know. We don't know what the child has really been through. Remember, these kids have every reason not to trust adults. Many of them will have been abused by adults, abandoned by adults, incarcerated-- Have you seen Margaret? No, I haven't. Sorry. Sorry about that. You haven't seen Margaret, have you? I think she's [INAUDIBLE]. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Have you seen the number of files on my desk? It's going to bugger up a lot of other kids. We'll do some shuffling. So, who cocked this one up? It's a whole load of things. Karen. Go make dollies, Helen. Dollies stink. Yeah, well go make them anyway. I'll be along in a tick. OK. But I won't drop Wayne and I won't drop Stuart. Do you smoke? Stinks of horses in here usually, but I just had it cleaned. Lulu, Polly, James, and Carter. [INAUDIBLE], that's the names. I've got to take them some feed so you can introduce yourself. Anything you fancy doing? Yeah, you. That's James. Wants you to feed him. Go on, give him some hay. Keep your arm flat and he won't hurt you. That's it, he won't bite. Say hello, then. You've got a name, haven't you? Hello, James. I'm Philip. And I draw these squares like bricks in a wall. And each square is like a little bit of your life. So any lip about my drawing and I'll clobber you. PHILIP KNIGHT: Ugly. When you've drawn in the bricks, we do a clock up the side and we say that everything in your life happens in one day. So like when were you born? February 2, 1975. Right. So in the first brick, you write the date when you were born. And up the side you do the clock. Now, all you do, you fill in the things you remember, like, I don't know, holidays, birthdays, your favorite teacher, your worst teacher, all the good and bad things, until we've got a wall full of bricks. And then we see which bricks need repairing. Simon? What's the best thing you remember from when you were little? Holidays. And where'd you go? Castle Gerry. Who with? Mom, dad, Si. Who's Si? Simon, my brother. Oh. OK. So bank Simon's named down on that brick, and mom and dad, and put about the holiday as well. What did you do there? Went fishing with Simon. Was it good? Brilliant. Well, put down about that as well. How can I not tell him? I mean, if they were holding back information like that, what else weren't they telling him? I think I messed it up. Well, it's always hard the first time. She said I was crap. Doesn't deserve you then. She's going out with another boy now. Still, plenty more fish in the sea. You could smarten yourself up a bit, though. Good-looking lad underneath that mop. Never know [INAUDIBLE] luck, eh? We need to talk. No, no, it's just one of our staff took Philip to-- well, the adoption farm made it fairly clear. No, it's normal procedure. Yes. But-- no, we haven't told him. But Mrs. Knight, if Philip and Simon are blood brothers, then don't you-- You can't. If he has a brother, a real brother-- Look, Phil's big problem is, he doesn't know who he is. So knowing that he and Simon are blood brothers is vital. I mean, this is a kid who's been told his real mother is a prostitute. That's the kind of bullshit he's been fed. And whatever the poor woman did for a living, I don't care. But Philip needs the truth. I mean, this is the first real human link he's got to hold on to for God's sake. [INTERPOSING VOICES] According to the adoption file, a decision was taken that the brothers would not be told they're related. Who said? It was agreed at the time. Oh, Jesus. I can't do map work with him if I'm holding back stuff like that. It's pointless. He's not stupid. He's probably half guessed anyway. I mean, what good does it do not telling him? I'm not sure. I'd like to think about it for awhile. Either way, we have to be sure we're covered. They could slap an injunction on us, anything. Wait till I've cleared it with Ken. Phil trusts me. Wait. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE]. What, love? Do you think she's out there? Who? My real mom? I don't know, maybe. What if-- What? Maybe I've got a whole real family. Listen, Phil, why don't we leave the map work for a bit and have a look at my horses, eh? I bet she is. Who, love? My real mom. Come here. Our client and his wife, Mrs. Knight, understand that consideration is being given to telling Philip about his natural mother. They have no objection to this, although they cannot see of what possible benefit this would be to anyone. However, they would most strongly object to Philip being told that Simon is his brother. And they seek an assurance that this will not happen, et cetera, et cetera. Neither our client, his wife, nor any of their family want any further involvement with Philip. The end. And I will not allow the structure of Cartref [INAUDIBLE] to go downhill because Philip can't control his emotions or muck him with the others. When am I getting a family? Won't be long now. Phil, Philip. Nicked them. You can have them if you want. Got my own fags. Jill. You said only me. Fuck off, Philip. Fuck off yourself. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Sit down. Mommy. Oh, that's it. That's it. Go on, then. Let it out. It's OK. That's my boy. Come on then. Gently, gently, gently. I know my mom loved me. Why? Why? It's OK. It's OK. If we don't get him a family soon, he's going to top himself. I work 18 hours a week. Philip's not the only bloody kid on my books, not that one, that one, that one, that one. They all want homes. I work 18 hours a week. I need more time. Don't tell me, dear. Tell the bloody government. I'm sorry but we've got to get Philip out of Cartref. Put him in temporary fostering till his community parents are ready. I'll square it with Ken. Just do it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome to Letterston. [MUSIC PLAYING] This is Philip. Is mommy in? Mom. Hello, Phil, I'm Winnie. Shit. I don't care what anyone else is saying. His foster mother won't have him back. Cartref won't have him back. We've no secure units. You haven't got his community parents ready. Nobody is blaming anybody. He's on a 10 week placement to team out. Sorry? Tomorrow. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Oy. [CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] I don't think it's funny. I don't think it's funny at all. He didn't move a muscle. You make a fucking sound and you'll be out here all fucking night. You will be remanded on bail, on the strict condition that you reside at Teemauer and abide by the instructions of that establishment until a convenient date is set for trial. You don't seem very happy, do you? All these offenses. Hm? How are you getting on? Are you all right? Yeah. Promise me, Phil, no more jumping bail, eh? Anymore of this and I'm going to crack up. Don't worry, [INAUDIBLE]. I feel lucky. [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, shit. [SIRENS] Now hold it up or you'll pass out. Who's this from? Me, stupid. It's a present. Thanks, [INAUDIBLE]. Does me mom know about me cutting my wrist? I really don't think that's going to make any difference now? Will you tell her? Yeah, I expect I'll call you later. Listen, I met your community parents. Shouldn't be long now. You reckon you can hang on here till then? Can I hang on at Cartref? But Phil. If you let me hang on at Cartref, I'll be good. I promise. But you're on bail. It's not that easy moving you. Tell them to go for it. Well, I'll try. Please, [INAUDIBLE]. Do my best. Philip's absconded again. Oh no. He's in [INAUDIBLE] police station. If you leave now, you can catch the 5:30 to [INAUDIBLE] then Karen will meet you there. Go on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome back, Phil. Stuff's in the back. All right, then. Don't forget your [INAUDIBLE]. Easy drive? I'll see you tomorrow. OK, thanks. If you don't let me go, I'm going to smash this place up. Oh, no you don't. What are you going to do about it? You touch anything-- - Yeah? - I said-- Yeah? Don't. If I agree to an application for an unruly certificate, he'll be jailed. We've no secure units in Wales. Jail's their only option. Well, frankly, where we are now, it's a case of stopping Philip from damaging other people as much as himself. All right, you've got it. But for God's sake, make sure he's checked hourly, either by the police or by one of our lot. And tell Stan Eastwood to get down there as much as he can until he's shifted. We do not want this blowing up in our faces. Tool, with one from [INAUDIBLE].. Right, uh-- Nope, been on holiday. Oh, lovely time. Needed it. Needed [INAUDIBLE]. How's the wife, then? And the baby? Oh, goes on forever. Here we are. See you in a week. I hope not. Keep your chin up, Philip. Now, Philip, let me tell you a bit about the induction, eh? First of all, we take everything you've got in your pockets and we put them down on a list. And then we put your clothes down on the same list. You go and have a shower. It's like he ceased to have a stake in his own future, you know? I'm sorry, I'm not quite with you. In Philip's eyes, we've let him down. By we, I mean the grown ups. His parents, social services, his teachers, and it's changed him. We've seen it in the way he looks at us. It's like-- it's like a mask coming of it. And that's part of the problem because he presents as quite calm, even cool when you try and discuss emotional problems. But the truth is, he's still a big kid. And both of us, all of us are very worried about how he's going to handle a prison environment. He's manifesting real signs of hopelessness since the self injury instance at [INAUDIBLE]. In my experience, Mr. Dowdell, this behavior pattern of removing stitches from a wound is not unusual in a disruptive young man. Philip isn't just disruptive. He is disruptive, that's true. But he's also desperate, which is why prison could be so dangerous. You do know about the [INAUDIBLE]?? Yes. His self injury? Yes. Yes. Yes, well I'll make a note of your concerns, Mr. Dowdell. The young offenders unit has had years of experience with this kind of young man. He isn't a young man. 15 years old. Pop your shirt back on. Take a seat. Any illness in your family? Ever been ill yourself? Do you read? Yeah. And write? Yeah. Ever seen a psychiatrist? Do you know what I mean by a psychiatrist? Bollocks he might. If you lock him up in an adult prison, Philip will top himself. [INAUDIBLE] then, [INAUDIBLE]. No, I mean it, Ken. And I won't be told to shut up anymore. I want what I'm saying now put in the minutes. All right, lovey. There's no need for that. We haven't got to that point yet. I think we have. Karen, you weren't there when he wrecked my office, or when he did in the police cell, or when he smashed up his bedroom. He was like a wild animal. So you shut him in the nick to make him better? What the fuck's that got to do with care? Karen, at the time there was no other option. No one disputes the need to get Philip out of prison. But in the meantime, our main objective is to keep him in one place long enough to achieve an introduction to his community parents. You can not keep Philip in an adult prison. Christ, there's gotta be a secure placement somewhere in Wales. There isn't. What Philip needs is something fast, something to kick him out of this cycle. He's a baby, Stan. He needs a family. And if the law wasn't so stuck up on us not keeping a professional bloody distance, then I'd bring him up myself cause he's a good, messed up kid. That's all. He's not Genghis Khan. I know he's messed up and I care about that. But you've no bloody idea the danger he is. All right, whoa. Let's all keep calm, shall we? Joe. I agree, prison is wrong for him. But the only other option given his history is a secure placement, otherwise we run the risk of him going AWOL while technically still in our care. If anything happened to Philip when he was out of community placement, Karen, we would be taken to the cleaners by the press and somebody would have to take the rap. Who are we looking after here? Philip or us? If you lost your job because of Philip, 50 other kids wouldn't have you. That's a lot to lose for one child. Oh, Jesus. Someone's got to say it, Karen. OK, right. So we know there are no secure placements in Wales. So Kate does a blitz on secure placements anywhere in the UK and the Elms keeps pushing ahead with his community parents. When's his court case? Friday. How far away are we prepared to look for a secure placement? Frankly, love, if you can find a kid's home with a door, a key, bars on the window anywhere in the UK, I don't care how far it is. I'll personally carry him there myself. Anything is better than prison. Come on, Joe, the truth now. It's just you and me. Why won't you put Philip with his community parents? I will when they're ready. Come off it. What are you waiting for? No, Charles still has to collect the reports and Ken still has to OK them. So break a rule. I'd like to, Karen, but I can't. Philip's on a certificate of unruliness. You can't just ignore a court order. Just do it. You're his last chance, Karen. If this falls through we've got nothing. We've got to be sure everything's right. And what if he kills himself before everything's right? It wasn't me, it was him. Right, so we're all agreed. We are recommending 50 days [INAUDIBLE] permission on any possible sentence. Do you understand? Do you have any questions? Off you go. Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. No, buy your own packets. See you tomorrow. Bye. See you tomorrow. Not if I see you first. Night, Karen. All right, see you tomorrow. Coming to the pub? Maybe, yeah. See you there. It came in internal mail. Who from? Well, it's obviously someone with access to Philip's adoption file. Never let me look at it. Maybe someone thinks we should be looking for his real mother. What are you going to do about it? I don't know yet. Can you stress anywhere else? No, I've tried them. No, they're full. Yeah. No. OK. Thanks. Kate, Mrs. [INAUDIBLE] on the line about the battery. What I'm asking is, are we absolutely sure his community parents are ready? Nothing's ever absolutely ready. But if you're asking me, do I think his community parents are as ready as they'll ever be, I'd say yes, they probably are. OK. Thanks, Joan. Nothing. What does Ken say? Try semi-secure. [INAUDIBLE] never going to buy that. He seems to think we might be able to persuade them. Any takers? There might be a place at [INAUDIBLE].. That's miles away. It's better than prison, Karen. Any news on the birth mother? Sometimes I think I-- Don't bother. How did it get like this? Shit. Got a cut wrist in my OU. Can you send the keys down, please, as quickly as possible, please. On his way down now. [INAUDIBLE] - Keep it up. Should be on his way down to you now. [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC PLAYING] You have? Oh, brilliant. Oh, Friday. Well, he's in court Friday morning, so it'll be Friday night on. Yeah, OK, thanks. Yeah. Bye. What up, Kar? Hello, Philip. Got any fags? What do you think I am, stupid? Now listen, I got some good news for you. Kate thinks she might have found you a bed at a place called Escalength. And if everything works out, you can go Friday after your court case. So what's it like? Well, it's better than this place, that's for sure. So I'm getting out Friday. Well, maybe. But don't go getting your hopes up. Did you tell my mom about me cutting myself? Phil, you've got to put all that behind you, you and Mrs. Knight. That's over now. But I have got some news about your real mom. Well, it's not a lot yet. But what I do know is that she was young when she had you and she was living in a caravan up in St. Davids when you were born. You're making this up, Kar? No. And you know they told you she was a prostitute, well, she wasn't. Just in those days, people were snobby about caravans. So where is she, my real mom? I don't yet. When we do find her, you can't expect to go back to her and be her baby. She may still be poor. She may need you. I could get a job, look after her, do a bit of gardening. Oh, you've got green fingers? I have. That may take awhile, Phil. That's all right. Getting out Friday. I don't believe it. What do they mean, not kosher? OK. Yeah. Thanks, bye. What? Philip's place at Escalength has fallen through. There's some question over supervision. Welsh office got some reports from the police about boys absconding. Apparently Ken only found out today. Oh, and there is quote, "no chance of a delay on Philip's Friday court proceedings" unquote. So unless Kate can find him another placement by tomorrow, he's going to have to go back to the knicker. What do we have to do, Joe? Won't be seeing you again. Look, one bed, that's all I'm asking for. I don't have the authority. Yeah, I know. I know. No, there isn't time. His court case starts in 45 minutes. Cartref. Look, I know I'm asking a lot, but there's nothing else available otherwise I'd never have phoned you. Yeah, I know. I know, sure. Fine, OK. Sorry. Bye. Great news, no beds. We've got a little bit of a problem, Phil. It's nothing we can't solve given a bit of time. We can't send him into court looking like that. He's still in our care, for God's sake. I've got some spare clothes in the car. I'll get them in a sec. I'm still getting out, though. The thing is, Philip, that the place we had lined up for you, it hasn't worked out. So you might have to go back for a bit. But we'll find something for you as fast as we can. It's just taking a bit longer than we thought. But I'm still getting out. Philip Knight. It's clear from what Mr. Edwards has told the court that social services have tried desperately to find accommodation for Philip. But since there is no suitable alternative available, we are minded to remand him in custody until further notice. Mr. Campbell, may we seek your guidance in this matter? Your worship, the home office circular states that any youth given a certificate of unruliness in the Pembrokeshire area must go to Swansea prison. Since these are the circumstances, I am unfortunately obliged to return you to Swansea prison. However, we remain most anxious about this young man's welfare and are willing to [INAUDIBLE] day or night if a place can be found for him. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah, hi, it's Kate Hawkins here again. Yeah, hi. Look, we've still got that boy who-- yeah. It fell through. Yeah. As soon as you can. Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] I know, but-- no, anything. As soon as it's free. Thanks. OK, but if you-- no. OK. Thanks. REPORTER: Independent radio news. [MUSIC PLAYING] Welcome back, it's [INAUDIBLE] Swansea sound, taking you through the late hours of the evening. Oy, next door, what you doing?
