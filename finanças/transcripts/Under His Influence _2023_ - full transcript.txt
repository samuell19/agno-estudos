That's your fault going out, turning up without me last night. Yeah. You all right? I don't know, girl, things have just been... But I do have someone who's been keeping my mind off things a little bit. Okay, let me see. - Mm. Who is that? - Girl. His name is Sadiq. [laughs] Damn! Girl, he is fine! As fuck, right? He from around here? I ain't never seen him before. Look, I know it's my birthday, but, ooh. I love to be wrapped up in the muscles. Okay, you can go do all that. - He got friends? - No. [dog barks in distance] - Girl. - What? - Is he married? - No. Look, don't act like you ain't never... Okay, you know what? I, I'm gonna shut up. Yeah, we not going there, but still. Okay, so what's up with him? [tense brooding music] Okay, I'm gonna tell you, but you cannot judge him. You promise? Say you promise. Okay, I promise.

[sighs] Okay, right to it. Okay. So it was my senior year of high school. Football season just finished, and I had to prep for my SATs. Every week, I would go by Mrs. Tumbler. She was my teacher and my after-school tutor. My grades was pretty messed up. I just received a scholarship offer, so we decided to do a couple more days a week. ♪ I told 'em or I walk away [Sadiq] On the day that everything happened, I was on my way to her house, and I stopped at the park to play ball.

Outta nowhere, cop cars come from everywhere. They hopped out on me with they guns out and everything. I'm scared as shit. [Young Sadiq] Hey, yo, you go the wrong guy. [people shout indistinctly] [Young Sadiq] Hey, I didn't do shit, bro! I ain't do nothing, man! Relax, man! Hey, y'all, somebody help me! - Cuff him. - Somebody help me! [Officer] Cuff him. [Young Sadiq] Y'all got the wrong guy, man! Relax. Hey, somebody held me, man! Hey, I didn't do nothing! [dramatic music] It wasn't until I got to the station that I found out Miss Tumbler had been murdered. Oh my God. They say I fit the description of somebody that was at the house. I tried to explain to them she was my teacher, but they didn't care. All they knew was they had an anonymous call that said I was there at that house and that they saw me choke her. I was 17. I was going to college. Why would I do that? I'm sorry. They didn't even have no evidence. All I had was my fingerprints in the house and this bogus ass caller saying they saw me there and that I choked her. They said I had scratches on my arm and shit. But you probably got 'em from playing basketball. Exactly, but, you know, now I'm here, serving a life sentence on some I ain't even do! Well, look, listen, look at me. I'm really, really happy that you opened up to me and told me everything. You really believe me? I do. [chuckles] So you gonna help me? [Diamond sighs] [door creaks open] Hey. Wasn't expecting you. Is everything okay? Yes. Is everything's okay. I just need to talk to you. I talked to your dad earlier. I don't know if you told you your hearing is in a couple of weeks. Oh, I, I haven't talked to him about that, but that's actually not why I'm here. Oh, okay. Is everything okay? I need your help with something. Talk to me. I don't even know how to say this. I feel crazy, but. - I'm confused. [laughs] - Do you remember this case? Yes, I do. It was horrible. Student kills his teacher before going to college on a football scholarship. Pretty tragic. Well, what if I told you that I believe he's innocent and I wanna try to help him? [tense music] I would say you need to focus on yourself at the present moment. My God, Cass, I knew you were gonna do this. What is this about? I truly believe he's innocent. I, I, I mean, what evidence did they really have? Enough to send him to prison for life. You know, okay, just take a look. Fingerprints in a house he's been in multiple times, scratches on his arm when he was playing basketball hours before, an anonymous witness. None of it makes sense. What are you asking me to do? You know, Cass, you always say you wanna help our community, right? This could be the perfect way. Think about it. His parents at the time didn't have the money to afford someone like you, a high price, high profile attorney, so he gets the short end of the stick. You know, the justice system is not fair to black men, and I got that from you. You said that. So all of a sudden you're an advocate for incarcerated black men? Well, I just, I don't know. I feel like a man should not spend the rest of his life in prison for a crime he didn't commit, don't you agree? [laughs] Diamond, this is not as easy as you think it is. It is very hard to get an appeal and to win, and as much as I like to give back to my community, this is a very expensive process, and if his family couldn't afford it then, who's gonna pay for it now? Well, that is where I come in. Oh no. Your parents would kill me. Oh, it's my money. Diamond, as your attorney, I advise you not to do this. I'm trying to keep you out of jail, remember? Cass, I'm doing it. Are you in or not? You know, for a long time, I've been looking for something to really validate myself. At this point, it's about me growing as a person, as a woman. You better be ready. Yes, yes! I am so, so ready. The clothes. We, we have to do something - Oh. - About the clothing. Okay, okay. Yeah, we can do that. So what's next? I can't. [Diamond] Come on. Ooh, I'm so excited! Okay, so where do we start? What do I need to do? [Cass] First, we make it official. We file a motion to start the appeal process. Once the district attorney gets the letter, he has to bring it in front of the judge. Everything in that letter has to be airtight. We have to point out every mistake they made in the investigation to give the judge a reason to grant the appeal. [tense music] The district attorney and the prosecutor will do everything in their power to get it denied. Once the judge makes his ruling and approves it, things get real dark before they get better. [stamp clicks] The bandaid gets ripped off all over again. [tense brooding music] Wait, the bandaid? Oh yeah. The wound gets reopened, and the whole case starts all over again. They will remind the world when a piece of shit Sadiq Harris is for killing Lori Tumbler. He'll become public enemy number one, and frankly, so will you. And I'm not talking about this little social media back and forth stuff that you do. I'm talking about real people saying and trying to do some really bad things to you. A lot of people really believe this black kid killed this white teacher. Are you ready for the slander that will come on you and your family? Oh, and let's not forget. You have pending charges, so you can forget about people feeling sympathetic and thoughtful about the rich black girl. The minute you put yourself out in front of this, everything changes. [sighs] Okay. I understand what you're saying, but I just really feel like with everything going on in the world, I can use my platform for good, more than just selfies and Instagram videos. I can really change this man's life. What if you're wrong? 10 years ago, a horrific tragedy struck our city. Lori Tumbler was taken away from us. We were made to believe we had caught the person who had committed this horrific crime, but now, unfortunately, we believe the wrong man has been convicted of this crime. No one should spend the rest of their life in jail for a crime they didn't commit. So my firm and I, along with Diamond Calloway, have decided to take on the appeal of Sadiq Harris. Well, this is long overdue. When I sat down with Sadiq and heard his side of the story, so many things didn't add up. The justice system has failed so many black men, and Sadiq is just one of many. So I had to look into the investigation and all of the evidence, and to my surprise, there was none. It's so disheartening because Lori Tumbler was not only an amazing teacher but an amazing woman who deserves a better trial. She deserves justice. She deserves a better investigation that results in finding her real killer because Sadiq Harris is not him. My heart hurts for Sadiq. He's been imprisoned for 10 years, his life ruined by an investigation done by lazy cops who racially profiled him. Sadiq Harris deserves justice. He deserves another trial. He deserves to be home living the life that he lived before this ever happened. So we're going to fight for him, and we need you all to fight for him with us as well. Thank you. [crowd chants "Free Sadiq"] Hold up. Wait a damn minute. Now this chick Diamond thinks she's Kim Kardashian with this whole #freeSadiqHarris movement?

Didn't mean to call you on such short notice. Oh no, it's no problem. So I have some good news and some bad news. Okay, let's start with the good news first. Okay. I think I have a lead on something huge. It's so significant, there is a chance I can get this case dismissed without ever going to trial. - Oh my God. Really? - Really. Sadiq's attorney during the trial was a guy by the name of Brad Meyers. Brad Meyers is now the district attorney. Okay. Brad is a really good friend of Stanley Tumbler, Lori's husband. There were college roommates. Whoa. [soft tense music] Now for the bad news. Brad held back valuable information from the case to protect Stanley, information that would've given a jury reasonable doubt and a possibility Sadiq would've never been convicted. Wait, are you serious? Well, wait. Why would that be bad news? Lori was having an affair with Sadiq. [tense music] They had been sleeping together for awhile. Brad didn't want that information to get out because, one, it makes Lori, the slain victim, look horrible, and two, gives motive for the husband to be a suspect in the case. My guess, they told Sadiq it would harm him rather than help him. And how do you know this is true? I'm the best lawyer in Atlanta for a reason. My investigative team is top notch. Oh God. So, so what's next? How do we, how do we flip this on him? I'm going to request that the case is dismissed on a technicality, let him figure out the rest. Sadiq probably didn't tell you because of these things. You need to make sure there's nothing else he forgot to mention. Trust me. I will. [heels clack] [people chatter indistinctly] Sit down. Sit down. [tense brooding music] Baby, what's wrong? You know, I put my whole life on hold for you. I got people out here trying to physically harm me, and you got the audacity to lie to me? Wait, what were you talking about? Sadiq, why didn't you tell me? - Tell you what? - Don't lie to me! Don't lie to me, Sadiq. You were sleeping with her? Sleeping with who? Sleeping with Lori. Were you sleeping with Lori, Sadiq? Were you sleeping with Lori? Diamond, yes, but they told me, they told me to say that I was not. It was the only shot I had for winning. I was 17. I was scared to death. Look Diamond, I'm sorry. I'd have said anything to get out in that position. I wasn't trying to lie to you. I'm sorry. I would never lie to you. You better not ever again, okay? Matter of fact, is there anything else you want to tell me? Nah, that's it, promise. All right. Cassaundra has a plan. [Sadiq sighs] Can I tell you about my week now? [laughs] Fuck. [door opens] Thanks for coming by. Let's make this quick, Cassaundra. I don't really approve what you're doing with the Sadiq Harris case. Since when have I needed you to approve of anything I've ever done? Funny that you should mention it though. Okay. So what? You have a picture of me and Stanley in college. So what? [folder slams] [dark brooding music] The point is you had reasons not to disclose Sadiq was sleeping with your best friend's wife, reasons like he automatically becomes a person of interest, reasons like Lori Tumbler looking like a horrible person and teacher for sleeping with one of her students, which is illegal. Press making a big stir about everything probably could have got the case dismissed. Maybe the husband wanted revenge. Two birds with one stone. Kill the wife, blame the black student lover. Sounds like a bad Lifetime movie. We both know you could lose your job over this, Brad, and we both know I could use every bit of this information to cause a complete shit show at trial. You abused your power as an attorney for Sadiq Harris. You misrepresented him and sent a teenager up the river for the rest of his life. - What do you want? - Drop the charges. Release my client from prison. Blame it on new information that came forth, you know, something you can't talk about at the moment. - You're wrong about all this. - No. Cops did a shit job investigating.

"Young Joc &amp; the Streetz Morning Takeover." You waking up with some real ones. I got my dog in the building, Mz Shyneka. - Good morning. - Yeah, and that boy Shawty Shawty. Hi! Now look it, y'all. Y'all know how we do. We like to bring the real to our show because that's what it is. I gotta hit the button one time for the real. - Okay. - That's right. All right, so look, man. This morning, we got what, what you could call a love story. Some people could say that it's very compelling, to say the least. Makes you want to just star things over sometime and see how you roll the dice and how everything plays out. In the building with us this morning, we have two individuals that I can't wait to talk to. You've heard the story. Yes. Our listeners have definitely heard the story, and now we actually get a chance to talk to 'em this morning. In the studio with us this morning, we have Diamond Calloway. Hey, what's up? What's up? What's up, Diamond? And we also have the man of the hour. You've heard the story about him. You've heard his tale, his triumph, Mr. Sadiq Harris. What's up, bro? Yeah, yeah. I appreciate y'all, and I appreciate the intro. - Yeah. - Yeah! - We gotta do that now. - Glad to see you! Aw man, it's good to be here. Nah man, we definitely are happy to have you, man. It's kind of crazy 'cause we were actually talking before you guys came, you know. We were like, "How do we start this interview?" Because, you know, your story is so crazy, man, considering you've, you've, I don't wanna use the word wasted 'cause that would be an insult. So I would definitely have to say you've given 10 years of your life. Yeah. - 10 years of your life. - Unwillingly. - Unwillingly. - Yeah. What's your wherewithal, if, if, if, if, if we can ask you, if we could just start it out with that? What is life like for you right now, brother? [sighs] Surreal. It's a surreal feeling. I'm happy to be here. I can't even really put it into words for you. Just wanna enjoy every moment. Wow, so 10 years. That gotta be, wow, overwhelming at least. So do you find yourself at home now like, "Hiya honey buns" or "Hi in your zoom zooms, wah wah," or something. Oh my gosh. I keep my, I keep my shelves and my, my night stand pretty organized, yeah, yeah. - Got that commissary right. - Still got some habits. I still got some habits, but I think she's, baby girl getting me right man. She getting me into the right rhythm. Keeping him together. - So now Mz Shyneka. - Yes. You know, we was going back and forth because us and I really knowing you, Diamond, you know, it was kind of like, "Ah, she probably was a rider from day one," and Mz Shyneka's still like, "No, you know, she's, she, you know, she, she carries herself really well," and I was like, "Yeah, she was probably trying to shoot her shot from off real." But it doesn't, it doesn't it- What really happened - Yeah. - In this? How did you guys connect? So we actually met on social media. - Okay. - He slid in the DMs, - Social. - You know, goes down in the DMs. [laughs] Social. - And- - We got phones in jail. - Exactly. - Like you don't know how- - Exactly! - Come on now. I mean, we don't talk about 'em. Your cousins call you every day during the show. [everyone laughs] We go live in jail, man. We know what's going on. - Y'all already know. - Right, right. But from there I went to meet him, I heard his story, t really touched me, and we just fell in love from there. What compelled you to put everything, your credibility, your name, your brand, everything on the line to fight for this man sitting next to you? Right, well, at the end of the day, I believe in what's right. You know, my parents taught me whatever's right, that's what you need to lead with. So when I met him, I heard his story. I looked in his eyes, you know, I knew that he was being truthful, and things just didn't add up on the other end. I got you. - Aw, that's so cute. - Aw. I love it. - But anyway, so from there, - I love it. I decided to lead with my bed foot forward and put everything I had into justice 'cause, at the end of the day, like I said, what's right is what I believe in, and I knew my baby was innocent, so. [bright rhythmic music] [birds chirp] [Sadiq and Diamond laugh] Okay, if you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go? [people chatter indistinctly] [Sadiq smacks] - I'd go to Hawaii. - Hmm. I know it's not like dream destination for everybody, but, I don't know, seems amazing there, so. - Okay. - Yeah. I'm gonna go away. - Okay, done. - We going to Hawaii. - Just like that? - Just like that. Playing in the sun, Right. - Drinking sex on the beach, - Right. - Having sex on the beach. - Lot of that. [engine rumbles] [tires screech] [tense brooding music] The fuck? That's the car that tried to hit me the other day. I hope you weren't enjoying your lunch. You remember me? No, not at all. I was like nine years old when you were coming to my house. I guess I do remember you. Good 'cause what you did to my mother I plan on doing to you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Can we get some security out here? - Is that a threat? - Yes. - Babe, stop. - It's cool, babe. [punches land] [men scuffle] Babe! Babe, stop! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! I don't care about prison! I'm gonna kill you! - Come on, babe. Come on. - Let's go. [door opens] Yeah, that's why I hate being in this position. I never let something like that even happen. Well, look, I don't know if we need to call Cassaundra or what, but this shit is outta control. Nah, nah, nah. We'll be, we'll be straight. We'll be good. [heels clack] [door slides] The hell is this? [tense music] What? I don't know. No, the entire agreement. [door opens] Yes. I'll have my secretary send the paperwork over. Brad. What do I owe the pleasure? She has to pay a $5,000 fine. She gets two points but no loss of license. It's the best that I can do. It's not the best you can do, but. [laughs] Just have it signed and back to my office tomorrow. Oh, [laughs] one thing I did wanted to mention in your little moral victory is that phone call from the witness you referred to as fake was actually real. It wasn't from Stanley. It was a girl. I can't disclose her name, and I doubt you care anyways. That's a nice watch. [door creaks] [tense brooding music] [soft tense music] [footsteps shuffle] [Brita thuds] [door slams] [footsteps shuffle] [water pours] [Brita thuds] [device chimes] [Voice On Device] Motion detected at the front door. [knife unsheathes] [knife clangs] [door slides] [water trickles] [dark tense music] [Speaker] He's not who you think he is. [body bangs against door] [Diamond whimpers] [Sadiq] What are you doing? [Diamond screams] Oh my God. [cries] You okay? [paper rustles] Who left this here? Ash! Come on babe, let's go! [Ashley] I'm coming! Wait, wait. Where where you guys going? We're going to our friend's destination wedding, remember? Right. Frank's, what, third wedding, right? Right. Hopefully the third time's the charm. You all right? What's on your mind? Yeah, I'm fine. I just, I, I don't know. I haven't missed sleeping lately, so. All right. Remember to take care of yourself, all right? Just take it easy, and remember, Botox is not to remedy to everything. Well, I know it's not for me, and I know this is not my scarf! - You don't even wear it. - Come here. Give me a kiss, girl. Listen, I'm going to text you the information - Okay. - To where we staying, okay? Use it unless you don't need to. - [laughs] All right. - Ernest, let's go. - Ew. - Babe, come on!

Trust me. You'll be happy that I did. [Diamond] Oh my God. - I'm saving 'em up. - All right. - Ew, ew. Please. - Okay. [laughs] All right, love you guys. - All right. - Be safe. - No parties. - Course not. All right, I'm texting you the phone number, all right? Love you. Come on, girl. - All right, I'm coming! - I got kisses for you. [Ashley] Oh, now you want a kiss. [door slams shut] What's going on? My parents just left for a wedding for a couple days. How are you? Seem tense, man. I know. Come on. So what you say I get you out this house today? I'm taking you to breakfast. Ooh. French toast? French toast, eggs. We gonna hold the bacon though. You know I love bacon. Yeah, well, today you could love turkey bacon. Ew. That shit tastes like cardboard. What? [laughs] [Diamond] So where you wanna go? Well, I figured we find something fancy, something nice. You know? Okay. Whatever you say. [Diamond laughs] [bright rhythmic music] [both laugh] Oh my God, this is so good. - It good? - Mm-hmm. - That look good. - No! I wanna see if it's good. It is a little bit good. Nah, it's a little bit good. You got the same thing. [both laugh] I'll be right back. I gotta use the bathroom. Okay. [slow dramatic music] [Crowd] Free Sadiq, free Sadiq, free Sadiq! Are you following me? You were at the press conference, right? [paper rustles] What is it with you and these drawings? What do you want? Look, I want you to meet me tonight at this address, okay? All the answers will be there. Please come. We're running outta time. No, you need to leave us a hell alone. You need to go somewhere, like- - The truth is gonna be revealed, whether you like it or not. [door slams open] [body thuds] Who the fuck is you? Who the fuck is you? [Speaker] What's going on?

This woman and these drawings she keeps planting. Who is she, Sadiq? What does she want? Diamond, you know my case was all over the news. It's got people emotions up and down, man. See, the sad part of my reality is people got a hard time trying to unsee what they've been told. [slow dramatic music] I, I, I don't know who this woman is. All I know is that she's not the first, and she is not the last. I need you to be strong. I need you to be with me. For real, we all we got. Just you and me, baby. [car honks] [crickets chirp] [door opens] [paper rustles] [tense dramatic music] [items thwacks] [phone rings and vibrates] Hello? Diamond, where are you? - I'm at home. Why? - I've been calling you. I had my phone on silent, and I must've passed out. [Cassaundra] Did you get my message? No. I literally just woke up. [Cassaundra] I found out some really crucial information. Okay. [Cassaundra] I need you to leave that house alone and come to my office. Why? What, what, what's going on? [Cassaundra] Please Just hurry. I'll tell you when you arrive. Sadiq? [slow dramatic music] Sadiq! If you can hear me, I'll be right back, okay? [boots thud] [crickets chirp] [door opens and slams] [footsteps shuffle] [chair slides] Fuck. [sniffles] You don't remember me, do you? 10 years ago, you ruined my life. [utensil scribbles] I know these are your favorite. I worked hard on those. Made them from scratch. I can tell. [chuckles] You're quiet today. Are you okay? [soft poignant music] I can always tell when things aren't going well at home. How was dinner last night? Do you like it here? Do you trust me? Yeah, you're like the only person I trust. What if we hung out all night, put on cool PJ's, cooked a really good dinner, and even had more cookies? Would you like that? What if it could be forever? Yeah, I, I would like that. [laughs] Guess what? I have more cookies going in the oven. So after you finish drawing, we'll do some schoolwork and plan out our girls' night. Cool? Cool. [hand swipes] [Lori sniffles] Miss Lori? Yes. - Can I use the bathroom? - Of course. [Lori sniffles] [pan clatters] [dark brooding music] [Lori breathes shakily] [papers rustle] Shayla, stay back there till I come get you! Okay. [jewelry clatters] [door opens] - Hey. - Hi, Sadiq. What are you doing here? What you mean what am I doing here? Sadiq, what we had is over, done, will never happen again. Damn, it's like that? I'm really busy, and we already talked about this. Yeah, look, I know I just, we also talked about me needing more sessions, and I gotta pass my SATs. Yeah, and frankly, that's none of my business. It has nothing to do with me. You have to go to college. I've already been through college, so get your shit together. [Young Sadiq] Why you be being so difficult? You know you're my tutor. [Lori] I told you you're going to have to get a new tutor. I don't wanna get a new tutor. Sadiq, what are you doing? You have to leave now. What wrong with you? You got somebody else in here with you? - No! - You sure? Sadiq, I am asking you to leave, please. - I miss you. - Stop. - Nah, I do. - Please just stop. Nah, so you don't wanna be my tutor no more? You don't wanna gimme none of this anymore? Let's get that straight. [Lori] Please, don't, don't, don't do this. Don't do what? Make you feel better than your husband ever did? Get the fuck out of my house! Sorry, those are your words, not mine! You started this shit, so you finna finish. - [screams] No, Sadiq! - You told me the truth! [people shout indistinctly] Why you switching up all of a sudden? You said that this was something you wanted! I'm just doing what you told me to do! No, this isn't ending! Sadiq! No, no. This isn't ending until I say so! Why are you fighting this? Why are you fighting us? Look, this, this was going fine. Why are you fighting us? Why are you fighting us? This was going fine. Why are you fighting us? Why are you fighting us? Everything was going just fine as it was. [Young Sadiq pants] Lori? Lori? Lori? Babe. Shit, shit. Oh fuck. [picture clatters] [sneakers squeak] [footsteps shuffle] [Young Sadiq pants] [Shayla sobs] Miss Lori? Miss Lori. [Shayla wails] [Shayla whispers indistinctly] You took the only person that ever really cared for me. She wanted to help me, and you ruined it. And I tried. I tried. I tried to do the right thing and tell the police what happened. That failed. See? I used to be scared of you. I'm not scared of you no more. I'm not scared of you no more. Prison was a gift for you, but death is what you deserve. She deserves to see you die. She deserves to see you die! I'm gonna finish this myself this time. - Put the knife down! - I'm so glad you're here. Put the fucking knife down. You're here for the truth, right? Untie him. All right, I, I'm assuming you saw my last drawing. - Untie him. - I can't do that! - Babe, shoot her. - Shut up! [dramatic music] He did it. He killed her. [Sadiq] Baby, shoot this crazy bitch! Diamond, I watched him choke and kill the only person I've ever loved. Baby, listen to me. Look at me. It's me and you. All you have to do is aim and shoot. She is a bump in the road. We could forget about her. Shoot her! I can't believe you're even considering this! You been shallow your whole fucking life, doing things for followers, for likes, trying to please people who don't even like you. You didn't do this for love. You did it for clout, Diamond. You don't care about being a good person. Your whole life's a fucking lie, but your lie, your lie is not my truth. [gunshot blasts] [Diamond screams] [heartbeat thumps] [Shayla whimpers] Are you okay? Shit. [tense music] [dramatic music] [Diamond screams] [heartbeat thumps] - Diamond, get up! Get up! - Where'd he go? I don't know, but we need to get outta here. Come on. [footsteps shuffle] [doors open] All right, come on. Let's go. Fuck, I gotta go back. I gotta, I gotta- - What? - The camera. It has everything on it. No, you can't go back! It's, it's okay. He's gone. - Shayla, no. - It'll be fine, I promise. I'll be right back. Shayla! Fuck. [hand slams] [gun rattles] [door chimes and slams] [crickets chirp] Shayla. Shayla. Shayla. This who you looking for? [footsteps shuffle] I know you're looking for her. Slut. You chose this little bitch over me once, but I'm gonna give you a second chance. I love you, Diamond. We built a life together. Think about all the shit you've done thus far to get us this far. We can kill this bitch right here, right now, leave her in the woods, and go right back to our happy lives. Diamond, I just gotta know I could trust you first. I need you to pull the trigger. I already got blood on my hands. It's your turn. Do it. Do you love me? I love me more. [gun clicks] [dramatic music] [bodies thud] [gunshots blast] [body thuds] [body thuds] [dark brooding music] - You okay? - I'm good. You good? [girls pant] Come on. Come on. Come on, come on. [footsteps shuffle] Social media has taken over the world we live in. People create fantasy lives just to impress people they don't even know. That was me. I was lost and couldn't find myself for many years. I was at rock bottom and would literally do anything to be famous, [chuckles] but not anymore. I'm done with that life. Girl, this hiking shit ain't no joke. - Right? - Whew, hot. [bright rhythmic uplifting music] Come on. Let's take a picture. Nah, I'm cool on that, girl. Come on! - Oh my God. - Get in. Okay. Ooh, that's some sexy shit. [women laugh] You know you wanna reactivate your Instagram account. - No I don't. - Yes you do. - No I don't. No. - Come on! - Girl, I'm off that. - Girl. Come on.
