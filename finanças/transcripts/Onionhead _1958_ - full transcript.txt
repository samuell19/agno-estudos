Onionhead Onionhead Onionhead Oh, now, Al, please stop. - Oh, Al. - It's okay, Jo baby. Alright, if that's how you want it. Oh, it isn't really. It's just.. Oh, heck. Anyway, I want you to know, I am genuinely fond of you. - Oh, Al. - This is the story of my life. Only thing, the next ten years I'm going to hate myself for being such a nice guy. We better get to the party. Excuse me. Excuse me. Good evening. Excuse me. Attention, everybody. Your attention, please. I'd like to propose a toast.. ...to the boys who are with us tonight.. ...who are entering the service of our country. Kappa Lambda's loss will be the nation's gain. Oh, uh, I can't drink to myself. To you. And to you, gorgeous. Well, and me. Two more, son. Uh, well, not quite so much, huh? This is my last night as a civilian. I'm gonna make it a big one. Here, now. This one's for you. Well, now, drink up. Help yourselves. I brought you some fresh punch. I haven't finished the one I have. We're doing just fine, the way we are. - This one's better for you, Jo. - What's got into you, Al? Just leave us alone, okay, friend? Sure thing...pal. - Al! - Look-look what you did. - What happened? - It's just a little accident. It was no accident. Don't just stand there, Woods. Get a cloth. He can get it himself. What's the matter with him? This time you've gone too far. You're fired! Suits me. For once, I'll get to use the front door. Al! Alvin Woods! - Now, why did you do it? - Skip it. Let' get out of here. I can't. This party means a lot to the sorority. The least you can do is go back and apologize. I should apologize? You're the one who owes me an apology. The way you were carrying on with that guy. - Carrying on with-- - Are you coming? - No! - Hah! I've known all along, you date me just to shock your snob friends. - You slay me. - Oh, sure I do. Been great for your ego to know I'm nuts about you, hasn't it? Well, okay, it was fun while it lasted and I'm not sorry about any of it. It was kind of special and wonderful. Alvin Woods, you are an idiot, aren't you? Well, if you really want to know what I think of you I honestly and sincerely think you stink! Oh, you finally said what you really think. Well, okay, I'm sick of you and the rest of your stuck-up friends. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Al.. Hey, I thought you're workin' late tonight. I got fired. In fact, I quit for good. What do you mean? I mean I'm fed up with sororities and working my way through college and this crummy room and dames. I'm clearing out and enlisting, I'll show 'em. Holy macro, Al! Here, you can have all my stuff. I won't need 'em. Oh Al, oh gosh, what can I say? We've been pals for almost four years now. You're a good guy and I hate to see you go. And the clothes and stuff.. I don't care if I never see another girl again. That blonde hadn't washed her hair for two weeks. All the same, every last one of them. Except for a few minor differences. My parting advice to you is never trust one any further than.. What's she doing? She's gonna wash her hair! Yeah. A shampoo cleans up the pores on the scalp and opens them up, so the hair can come through without any interference. Okay, okay, Windy. You saw me. - Fine. - Hello, Pop. I'll be a son of a monkey's uncle, if it ain't ol' hot shot! How are you, boy? How are you? So glad to see you. Doggone if I'm not.. Sam, I want you to meet my boy. - I've heard a lot about you. - Mr. Turner. I want you to meet my boy. Glad to meet you. Just sit a minute. I won't be long. About that shampoo, Mr. Turner I've changed my mind about giving it to you today. But you said-- I know I did, but your pores are open. A very healthy condition, and too much shampooin' might rot the roots of the hair. 'How're things at college?' Fine. My boy's by the way of getting himself a high confalutin' education. He won't have to operate clippers like his old man does. He's a fine looking boy. You ain't one bit proud of him. Well he's wise, he's all I've got. Because I'm stuck with him. That'll be, um, two bits, Mr. Turner. Alright, sir. Here you are. And a little something extra, for the boy's education. Thanks a lot, Mr. Turner. Well, now. Good luck, young fellow. Thank you. Come on, hot shot, we'll get ourselves a couple of beers. - See you later, son. - Yes, sir. Pop, I'm on my way to join the service. That's what I came to tell you. Oh. Did you hear that, Millie? My boy's joining up! I'll bet ol' Hitler won't dare mess with us now. - He'll look good in uniform. - You're darn tootin'. Bring us a couple of more beers when you get a chance. - We're aimin' to celebrate. - Sure, Windy. - This'll do me. - Oh, okay. - I have to be traveling. - Oh, what's the hurry? Stick around a few days. I've to be at the recruiting office in the morning. You'll come and see your old man before you go shipping out? Sure, Pop. If-if I can. You're gettin' to be a good looking man, hot shot. Oh, one thing though. You gotta take care of your hair. Do you think I'm gonna be bald? I noticed my hair's gettin' a little thin-- What you gotta do, you've got to stimulate your scalp. You know, keep it clean, the blood circulating. Now, the best thing for that is a good massage. - Here, I'll show you. - Pop, please, please! Not here. Well, well, anyway, you-you get the idea. What I mean is, son, you.. ...gotta brush your hair every day. You gotta keep it clean and healthy up here. Wear your hat as little as possible. At the first sign of falling hair, do something about it. That's the best advice I can give you! Thanks. Well, it's gettin' late. Too bad you can't stick around a few days. I'd show you how to treat your scalp. Next time. I just want you to know where I'll be. Well, sure. You need any dough? No, I'm loaded. Well, I better be going. Goodbye, Pop. Behave yourself. Don't forget my advice. - Write to me, son. - Sure, Pop. Row! Get together! Row! Get your back into it, O'Neal! Get that grip against your chest, Berger! Come on, you! Stroke! Stroke! Turn right, oars! Cross oars! Right ,then. Take a five minute break. - How long you been in, Woods? - Eleven miserable days. I outrank ya', I'm in twelve. - Everybody outranks me, buddy. - Look at these blisters. And these hands used to give the best haircuts in Cincinnati. You're a barber, O' Neal? Yeah, anything wrong with that? - No. - Where're you from, Woods? - Oklahoma. - You one of them Okhis? Yeah. I didn't know they took Okhis in the Coast Guard. What I can't understand is how you guys passed the physical. - Not to mention the I.Q. test. - What're you, a wise guy? - You want trouble, Okhi? - Knock it off! Since you guys have got so much energy let's get back in the boat. Let's go! Let's go! Everybody, let's go! Cease fire! Mighty fine shootin' there, what's your name? - Woods, sir. - Clobbered that target good. Next gunner. Hut! Come on! Come on! Go! Hurry! - I can't make it through. - Break it up! Battalion! Ten-hut! Right face! Right shoulder, arms! Forward march! Marching, marching. Twelve weeks, all the water I've seen so far is sweat. - Knock it off! - That Leggas! At least we'll be gettin' outta here in a couple of days. Stick with us, Okhi, put in for Hawaii. - Good dames there. - Not interested. Huh? He just ain't interested in women. Right Turn! Steady, TURN! Woods! Alright! Aright! Wake up! Wake up! Come on! Let's go! Oh, just keep it quiet in there. Come on! Get up! Let's go! You're shipping out today. You report to classroom 5, write up charts, take up your orders. Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Hit the deck. That goes for you too, Woods. Revelry! Get up. Woods! Come on, you've been pushing us gum boots around for 12 weeks. Let's see how really tough you are. Well, grab him you guys! He's gone nuts! What's the matter, you ain't quitting, are you? I thought you were a big man. You're in trouble, boot. You're gonna draw brig-time for this. I want some of that brig-time, too. - Yeah, let's all do brig-time. - Yeah. Okay! Okay, you're asking for it. Now, all three of you guys are in trouble. I got ways of taking care of your kind. You dumb jerks had to buy in? "The Boston Massacre occurred in this area." Eh, massacre is right. The brig would've been better than this. We ask for assignment to Hawaii. Leggas and that stinking' paddle. He sure fixed us good. I should've killed him when I had the chance. Yeah. "Woods," he says, "there's a shortage of pot wallopers in the Boston area. You're gonna be a cook." "Well Leggas," I says, "I only waited on tables, and hated it." "Woods," he says, "you're gonna be a ship's cook!" Me, who never cooked a thing in my life. If I'd only kept that waiter's job off my record. Boston ain't the end of the world. Prove it. Let's get a drink. - Three beers. - Ship's cook. At least you got a rate all the way up to 60 a month in one jump. At that service station, I won't be a lousy seaman second class for months. You know what they do to a ship's cook who can't cook? They murder him. Boston area. Now, in Chicago.. ...I got women hanging all over town, like grapes. In Norfolk, I know a couple of wild ones that are just made for breathing pleasure into the air. In Frisco, there's a school teacher. Turns into a pillar of fire at night. Now, Boston.. Boston, I don't even know a bean. Well, as long as we're gonna split up, let's pitch a party. How about it? Hey, Al.. Excuse me, miss. Would you care to dance? I don't recall being introduced. My name's Al Woods. I'm Stella Papparonis, and this is my girlfriend, Gailla Downs. - Please to meet you. - Hello. Now, how about that dance? Well, I...I don't like to leave my girlfriend sitting alone. Who are your friends? So you noticed us? I'm very observant. Berger! Gailla, I'd you to meet my two buddies Charlie Berger and Harry O'Neal. Happy to make your acquaintance, chaps. Same here. The pleasure's all mine. Sit, boys. I'm keeping Stella all to myself. I just got into town. - You live around here? - Uh-huh. - Come here often? - Mm-hmm. Gailla and me work in the drugstore, around the corner. I like your perfume. It's really toilet water, but it's-it's French. It's called Amor, that's French for Love. Who gave it to you? Nobody. It was a special and I get a discount. You mean you don't have one particular boyfriend who spreads rare gifts at your feet? You talk crazy.. ...but you're interesting. - You know something.. - What? I like your eyes. They're green. I'm the jealous type. Who are the men in your life? Nobody special. Honest. I don't bother with the riff-raff that's around. You've got...nice shoulders. You're nice all over. Your teeth.. ...so angular. Better to bite you with. Never been bit. You haven't lived, Stella, but you're going to, from now on. This is your life line.. ...and this is your heart line. Show me, again. Right here. Again. Now, come on. Ante up. She ate more than any of us. I'm just hungry all the time. Me, too. Here you are, sweetie. Keep the change. Come on, we gotta get to the station. Come on, Al. Let's go. I promised Stella I'd take her home. Oh, never mind. I don't want to change your plans. No, no. We'll drop you and Gailla off on the way. Hurry up, huh? It was a very enjoyable evening. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Goodnight. What's your rush? None, I guess. I want to see you again. Maybe, tomorrow night, if I can get leave. I'll call you, okay? You don't know my number. Yeah, that's right. It's PARKER-3-6-6-1. Aren't you gonna write it down? Don't have to. I need one last whiff of that perfume to carry to my lonely bed. We're waiting. Come on. You scared me. I was afraid maybe it was my father. Are you seeing us off to the station or ain't you? Yeah, sure. Come on. See you tomorrow night. Come on. Let's go. Halt there, you! Now, where do you think you're going, man? This is the Periwinkle, isn't it? It is. I'm assigned to the Periwinkle. That may be, but there is a proper boarding procedure or haven't you heard? What's your name and rate? Al Woods, ship's cook, third class. You must've come off a sloppy ship. Don't think you can get away with it because we're a buoy tender. You salute the colors, address an officer as Sir and request permission from the O.D. to come aboard. I'm the O.D. Yes, sir! Permission to come aboard, sir? Just a minute, Woods. There's the small matter of saluting the O.D. Then you request permission to come aboard. Now, let's run through it again. So you'll be sure to remember. Where would you like me to start? At the gate or should I go clear back to boot camp? Don't be insolent! I shouldn't advise that at all. Permission to come aboard, sir? Permission granted. - Osborne? - Yes, sir. Quartermaster Osborne'll take you to the galley. The ship's cook will assign you. Follow me. That's Mr. Higgins. The ships commissary officer. 'The rest of the officers on board are pretty nice guys.' Anything would be an improvement. Hey, Wildoe. Here's your new cook. Why did you leave your last ship? Uh, this will be my first time on ship. Where'd you go to cooking school, in New London? I, uh, I didn't go to cooking school. Got my rate kind of sudden. Right out of boot camp. The truth is I didn't cook before. I knew it. I knew they'd send me a dead-beat. I knew they would. Well, I better show you where the cook's quarters is. No, you don't. Not in my room. That's his right, Wildoe. The empty bunk's for the other cooks. - No! - Where at, then? I don't care. Anyplace, but not with me. Throw him overboard. There's an empty bunk in the berth deck. - You rate better than that. - It's okay. Attention! - Very funny. - Knock it off. The new cook. Here's your bunk. - Here's your locker. - Hey! He's supposed to sag at Wildoe. - Wildoe don't want him. - Why not? I guess I'm not his type. Maybe you ain't ours, either. Boys'll take care of you. - Ow! - Shh. Hey, Cookie! Hey, Cookie! I'm talking to you. Yeah, what? You better be able to cook better than Wildoe or we'll cut your throat. - Good morning. - Good morning. - What do you want me to do? - Nothing. You ain't gonna ruin no chow on my galley, Mack. What do you know about cooking, anyway? - Not much, but I could learn. - Yeah, not on my time. This ain't no cooking school, Mack. Look, buddy, I didn't ask for this job. I told them I couldn't cook. What, are you bragging or complaining? It ain't funny, Gutsell. I had to go to New London and sweat for six months to earn my rate. I had to be in the Coast Guard four years before I got a chance to go for a rate. Now they give phonies like you a crow and apron in four months. I told you, I didn't ask for it. Just stay out of my galley. That's an order. Okay, okay. But only, uh.. ...how about a special liberty tonight? Boy, you got a lot of crust. Oh, I have a very important personal matter to attend to. - My poor ol-- - Oh, get out of here. Is it my fault you're so dumb it took you four years to earn a rating? When you get all done sulking, let me know. I'll see you, rotten shit! "Dear Alvin.." Alvin? "Just heard you were in the Coast Guard "so I'm grabbing a minute between classes "to wish you the best of luck. "Everything's pretty much the same around the ol' place. Drop me a line. Josephine." Josephine! Postcard! Hey, Woods. - Woods. - Yeah? You've gotta cook noon chow. Wildoe's dog drunk in his room. What're you giving me? He cooked breakfast, didn't he? That was three hours ago. He must've had a bottle on board and hit it afterward. He's dumber than I thought. Drinking on board's a serious offense. That's tough. I got troubles of my own. Someone's gotta cover, you're the only other cook on board. Even if you can't cook. He gave me orders to stay out of his galley and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. The mess cooks'll help you. Come on, Woods. - Give him a break. - I refuse flatly. They'll throw the book at him. - I hope they boil him alive. - Oh. How do you start this thing? Oh, it's simple. I'll show you. This here's an oil blower range. Overhead's the oil tank. You turn this valve here to start the oil going. Now, this in front, it's a blower. - Opens up like this. - Yeah. Now, you push this button here, see.. ...to start the blower. It's electrical. Now, this little lid on top.. ...that's the fire hole, comes off, just like that. Now, then.. ...match. Paper. Strike the match, you light the paper.. ...take the burning paper, and throw it in the hole. Just like that. Sometimes, it does that. May I suggest you turn off the oil? It ain't lit yet. - Where's Wildoe? - Sick. You mean drunk as a skunk. I'm Dave Hubert. Ward-room steward. - Oh, hi. - They say you can't cook. That's a fact, friend. I'm a non-cooker by birth. You figure I'm scorchin' enough cow for lunch? What's the matter? Nothing. It looks to me. Too good, in fact. I guess Wildoe didn't get a chance to tell you. Mr. Higgins wants us to economize. So let Higgins do without meat in the ward-room. Excuse me. See four. "For leavening "use stock yeast, sufficient quantity should be used "to raise the dough, but always bear in mind a little goes a long way." Well, well. The invisible man. - Where are the mess cooks? - I don't know. They're laying out on you, to find out how much they can get away with. It'd take too much time to hunt 'em up. Well, I guess anybody can become a petty officer these days. Alright, Gutsell, hit the deck. Climb out of that sack and make it fast. Oh, who's gonna make me? You, Cooksie-wooksie? - That's an order! - Ho, ho, ho. I can't touch you. You outrank me. Don't let that stop you. Give me any more guff, I'll knock your head off. You know when you're supposed to be in the galley. Where's that other gold-bricking jerk? Who, Poznicki? You better not call Poznicki a jerk. 'He ain't scared of your rank.' Climb out of there, you ape! Get up to the galley, on the double. You still wanna argue the point? Not here, on the ship. I'll see you one night up on a street where you can't hide behind your rank. - Well, clean up the mess. - Yes, sir. - Did you say something? - Not me. You ought to do something about that stomach, Poznicki. Come on, you guys. Help me! Whatever it is, Cookie, it's hot. - I mean hot. - I know it's hot. Push! What happened? I guess I used too much yeast. Too much yeast? Remain calm, I'll handle this. - Hey, how 'bout some seconds? - Let me check. - They want more meat. - That's the last of it. About time. They already had three portions. - You got any more salad? - Fresh out! Never seen 'em eat so much salad before. There you be, Dave. The skipper always eat alone in his cabin? Yeah, he's a funny guy. Well, I hope he likes it. Thanks. This is the best chow I've ever eaten on the Coast Guard. That was swell chow you fixed, Red. Nice going, Wildoe. You ought to make roast beef like that. Best ever. 'Wildoe.' Compliments to the chef from the ward-room. Yes, sir, Mr. Bennet. Thank you. You're improving. Yo, Woods. You the one that cooked chow? Uh-huh. Dish up a plate of your slop. I've been getting nothing but complaints. There's only these few scraps left. Too salty. I'll watch that in the future. So long as you're getting paid for cooking you're gonna have to stay in your regular watches from now on, Mack. There'll be a menu in here every day and you better cook what it says. Look, I was lucky today, that's all. I still ain't a cook, so.. I wish you'd keep that in mind when you write up the menus. You're supposed to be able to handle any menu I make up, Mack. And don't ever forget who's the head cook. I'm in charge here, completely. You take orders from me. Make cinnamon rolls for chow. - Have a heart. - That's an order. Look, I never baked a thing in my life. What's more, wear your chef's hat on duty. I'm losing enough hair just from worry. At least the skipper knows what's fit to eat and what ain't. This cooking ain't so bad, once you get the hang of it. What's eating you, Ozzie? Higgins refused to approve my transfer again. Oh, well, Boston ain't such a bad town. My wife and four kids are jammed into two miserable rooms here when they could be living decently with my folks out in California. What's to keep you from shippin' your family out there anyhow? No! We stay together. - Hey, Woods. - Yeah. Mr. Higgins wants us to lay to his cabin. I'm busy. What's he want? Come on. He sounded hot under the collar. Chief. What's the per-day mess allowance here? - Eighty six cents a day, sir. - Exactly. I should think that any competent reasonably intelligent cook would be able to manage his mess on that, wouldn't you, Wildoe? - Yes, sir. - Then why aren't you doing it? Sir? Our general mess has a deficit. For the past month, we've operated on a loss. - That's got to stop. - I don't understand, sir. Everything's the same. Except for one thing. I say it's sheer incompetence. This is good duty on the ship. It beats iceberg patrol or weather ship. Yes, and light-ship duty, too. Your men have a soft berth here, maybe that's the trouble. You don't know how lucky you are. - Is that all, sir? - No, it isn't, Miller. You're supposed to be the enlisted head of the department. - What have you to say? - You're doing all the talking. Now, watch yourself, Miller. Because you're retiring doesn't give you the right to be insolent. A court martial and a reduction in rank would take a big bite out of that pension you're looking forward to. Mind how you address a superior officer-- - Is that all, sir? - Yes, for the time being. It's for some time now, I've known his useful days are over. You're the ones I'm counting on to lick this deficit. Shave quarters, eliminate waste. Cut down on the size of the meals. By the way, when Miller retires, I see no reason why we should bring in an outsider to head up the department. No reason at all, why you men shouldn't each step up a rung. Provided of course, we whip this deficit. - That's all men. Dismissed. - Aye-aye, sir. Almost seemed like he's trying to bribe us, huh, Wildoe? I smell something burning. My cinnamon rolls! General quarters. General quarters. Man your battle stations. On the double. Help me into this thing, will you? Oh, take it easy. It's only a drill. - Drill? - What'd you think? We ain't in a war, stupid. Nobody's mad at us. This tub ain't done nothing, and we never will. - I just thought, maybe that-- - What? - Ah, nothing. - You sure panic. The skipper gives us false alarms all the time whenever his ulcer's acting up. - He's got an ulcer? - Yeah. Everybody knows that. So, he's got an ulcer. Heh! That's why he didn't eat my chow. - What's so funny? - Nothing, sir. These General quarter drills are serious business. You better learn this is a taut ship. You're the new man, aren't you? Yes, sir. Woods, ship's cook. Haven't you got an experienced man to put on this gun? The regular gunner Erwin, is AWOL, sir. Woods gunnery record in training was excellent. He acts likes this tub of his could see action whoever did get into the war. A buoy tender. Stupid anti-aircraft gun won't go down low enough to shoot anything on the water. - Big deal. - You know it all, huh, Cookie? You almost landed us right out of our liberty tonight. Hah, who gets liberty? You do, stupid. You're in the third section, ain't you? Yeah! What did you bring Gailla along for? I don't trust myself alone with you. Give me a sporting chance to see if I can be trusted or not. Get rid of her, huh? Don't be foolish. She's my very best friend. Devoted to me. She even changed her name, so it would sound more like mine. You two make a very attractive couple. Why, thank you, kind lady. You're a marvelous dancer. Why don't you dance with him, Gailla? I don't mind. Really. Oh, Stella. That's awfully sweet of you. But Al doesn't want to dance with me. Don't be foolish. He'd be delighted. Wouldn't you, Al? ...yeah. Sure. Well, since you insist.. Gutsell! Gutsell, ol' buddy. Am I glad to see you? Listen, I got the cutest little girl over here just dying to meet you. - Huh? - Yeah. Gailla, I'd like to you to meet my ol' buddy, Frank Gutsell. - Sidney. - Yeah. Hey, you're alright, baby. Wanna dance? I'm Gailla, and I-I'd love to. Now that Gailla's taken care of, let's get out of here. Are you sure she'll be alright with your friend? What, ol' Gutsell? You kidding? He's the salt of the earth. I trust him like my own brother. I had such a good time, Al. You're a good conversationalist. Yeah, it was fun. Well.. Oh, you make me weak all over. I've been weak ever since I met you just thinking about you. You're so strong and wonderful. Please don't take advantage of my passionate nature. Let's go to your place. No, Al. Not with my family in there. I'll be quiet, they won't hear a thing. We can't. They come from the old country. They're very strict. It's late. They'll be asleep. You don't know my father. He has a hearing like a hawk. Can't we go some place? Alright. Oh, Al, please stop. You're laughing at me. Oh, no, baby. It's just history repeating itself. I was laughing at myself. Honest. I'm such a sap, when you say stop, I stopped. You know I want you more than anything in the world. - Goodnight, Mr. Woods. - Will I see you Saturday night? - No, never. You laughed. - Listen, Stella, please. It had nothing to do with you, believe me. Say you'll see me Saturday night. I've got plans. What kind of plans? A nice quiet room, in a hotel. Champagne, winter strawberries, the works. Strawberries give me a rash. Listen, we can't stop seeing each other now. You're like diving into a brick wall. See you Saturday night, at the bar. I'd like a room and wife for me and my bath. How is that? W-w-well, see, I'm going down to the train, to pick her up and-and bring her back here later. She just wired me, she lost all her luggage including her wedding ring. Yes, sir. Please sign the register. - That'll be $7 in advance. - You bet. Sorry. Hello, Al. - Hi. - Let's dance. What'd you bring her for? - Well, I-- - Ah, let's get going honey. Go where, darling? I'm having dinner sent up. Everything's ready, baby. I'm sure I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. I'm talking about a hotel room. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Hey, listen. What's going on? You trying to rat out on me? You're acting pretty gruesome, if you want my opinion. That's right. Go ahead and insult me. Oh, who's insulting anybody? I just wanna know what's the score here. That's all. What's the deal, baby? I-I never dreamed about anything like that in mind. You never dreamed.. Oh, no. Don't say that, baby. Our acquaintanceship hasn't gone that far yet. How do I know you're really serious about me? Serious? I'm desperate! Now, look. You're not pulling that stuff. You're not going to bail out on me at the last minute. Just-just what do you think I am? I know what you are. You're a cheap little, dirty double-- Bartender. Bar.. One more bottle. Keep the change. Thank you. When I give an order, I expect it to be executed, you see. Oh, have a drink, you ol' academy cook, you. Hey, ba-hey bartender. Another glass for my ol' buddy who just happens to be the best baker in the Coast Guard. I wish I could make cinnamon rolls like you. No hassle, buddy. About them cinnamon rolls.. ...when I tell a guy to make cinnamon rolls.. Nobody can make cinnamon rolls like you can, Red. I'm sick of that "Red" bull! I'm talking about when I say make cinnamon rolls, Mack. - Have another. - I'll drink with you. Let me tell you about a lousy little broad I just told off-- Wait a minute, just a second, hold the photograph. All I wanna know is, did you or didn't you read the menu I left for you this afternoon. I borrowed my whole next month's pay. Imagine that. Even bought champagne. I've been in the Coast Guard eight years. So, when I tell a guy to fix cinnamon rolls.. I ordered a special meal, did everything right. Gonna have a wonderful time. And then she said, "No." It happened to be hard times in my life. The last minute something always happens.. ...to foul up a deal. So, did you or didn't you fix cinnamon rolls for chow? As a matter of fact, I didn't. Didn't fix no cinnamon rolls for chow? Nope. Psst. Gotta confession to make. Sick and tired of cinnamon rolls. Hate cinnamon rolls. Same here. Who's in charge of the galley? You are, Chef. Okay. Show me me the ship. When I'm telling you to fix cinnamon rolls.. I borrow that money.. - ...story of my life.. - ...cinnamon rolls.. ...they always say no. When I tell a guy to make cinnamon roll, Mack.. Now hear this. All hands laid to the buoy deck. On the double. Hey, Woods! Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up, guys. Didn't you hear the spot box? Something's up. Should've seen Higgins face. Don't mention that face to me. I ain't in such hot shape as it is. Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up. Now hear this. Now hear this. All hands laid to the buoy deck. This means now. On the double. This is the Captain speaking. We've just received word that the Japanese have bombed Pearl Harbor. That means we're at war. The Coast Guard will be transferred to operations under the Navy for the duration. This ship will go under the ship yard and will be painted battle grey. All leaves are canceled. There'll no liberty until further notice. That is all. You were on the radio. Give us the straight dope, Sam. What'd you hear? Everything is classified. Sorry. The biggest thing that ever happened and you can't even get off this tub to buy a newspaper. I worked 20 years for that retirement. Practically had that pension in my hand. For once, I'm glad I'm on this tub even if I have to work for you. What could be safer than a buoy tender? Ain't gonna be safe if you don't clean my oven better than you did the last time. A war going on, and he's worried about his oven. Dear Jo.. Thanks...for the postcard. Well, Woods. Carry on. Wish me luck, and I'll reciprocate. All the luck in the world, Lieutenant. Us peasants sure hate to see you go. You mean you hate to see Higgins become Executive. If somebody has to go, why couldn't it be him? What's the name of your new command, sir? - The Algonquin. - The Algonquin? Convoy duty. Well...anyhow, I hope we'll meet up again. The war will probably arrange it. Okhi! - The barber! - Hey, Okhi, pal. Hey, a pharmacist's mate. How about that? Just call me Doc O'Neal, pal. You there, Mack. You forgot to salute the colors when you came aboard. Sorry, sir. Just met up with an old buddy of mine I haven't seen in a long time, sir. Yes. I was observing the touching scene. But that's no excuse for laxness. Hey, what kind of a ship we got here, anyway? Oh, you just met our new Exec, that oughta give you some idea. Come on. I was seeing your ex pig at the Oval last night. She was asking about you. Don't tell her nothing. She ain't hard to look at. You can have her. Too dark. "Dear Son, how about a letter? Best regards, Your old man." Just left Stella. Never asked about you. Never even mentioned your name, Mack. Yeah? So what, Red? Hey, watch that Red stuff. So, I walked her home. Any objections, Mack? Nary one. Help yourself. I'm not her type, boy. I figure, she, uh, kind of goes for me. Why not? She's never tasted your lousy cooking. - I wanna know the truth, Mack. - The truth shall make men free. Oh, never mind that smart stuff. I'm serious, I gotta know. How, uh.. I mean, uh, how thick did you get with her? You know what I mean. Don't lie to me, Woods. Who, Stella? You're wrong, what you're thinking. But you tried, didn't you? Everyone tries with a good looking dame. But like I told you before, I wasn't her type. Couldn't get to first base with her. Okay. Okay, I believe you. Umm.. We're gonna get married, Stella and me. When is the happy event? - Only one thing. - Yeah. It's a lousy time to get married. One time is as good as another. There's a war on now, you might get shipped out. You'll be away for more than a year. So what? Well, it's a strain on any marriage, Red. What's a little strain between a guy and his wife? Yeah, but what's she doing all that time? Wait. Just waitin', Mac. I can see the judges eye As the handed you the prize I bet you made the cutest bow Oh you must have been beautiful baby 'Cause baby look at you now - Don't be sorry. - You got it, sister Red. Hey, Wildoe, Hands off until tonight. What do you think of that cake, honey? Wildoe baked it himself. Did you really, Wildoe? I certainly did, Mrs. Osborne. Ain't that right, Woods? That's right. All by himself in his little old galley. May I have the pleasure of this dance.. ...Mrs. Wildoe? Why, of course, Mr. Wildoe. Oh, doesn't she make a gorgeous bride? How about a dance, baby? Oh, well...alright. Don't move, you guys. I got you covered. Hamburger! Ol' New Orleans drunkards. Their own sweet scourges. Sit down. Tell us what you've been doing. Have a drink, pal. Some wing-ding. Hey, ain't one of you jugs getting hitched? Nah, a buddy of ours. Red Wildoe. In fact, you know the bride. Al's old girl, Stella. Oh, sure. The one you met that night in Boston. She's some dish. Yeah. Oh.. - Excuse me, dear. - That's alright, dear. I didn't mean it. Excuse me, sonny. I am sorry, honey. I guess I ain't much of a dancer. It'll be alright, darling. My foot isn't broken, yet. Lots of luck, Stella. Remember me? Charlie Berger. Oh, yes. You're a friend of Al's. - Right. - Excuse me, excuse me. How's chances of a dance with the blushing bride? I'm terribly sorry, but I promised this next dance to Al. Is it okay with you, Red? Anything Stella wants, she gets. That's the way it's gonna be from now on. Why'd you marry him? For the things every woman wants. A home of my own and a family. But why Red? You know something? He's the only one who ever asked me. The others just wanted a good time. You included. I suppose, you didn't want a good time? I still don't, for that matter. I've got security now. A husband with a steady job and benefits. An apartment of my own. Everything respectable. Keep it that way, huh, Stella? I never thought you'd be giving me that kind of advice, Al. Stella! Come on back. It's time to cut the wedding cake. Stella, Red wants a picture of you cutting his cake. Hold it. Go on, cut it, Stella. Well, well, if it ain't the Hooligan Navy.. ...having a wedding shindig. Shove off, soldier. This is a private party. First, how about you shallow water-boys giving us some of that cake? It's Stella. Hey, Stella, remember the great-- Hey! Why don't you leave us alone? Come on. Come on. Alright, alright. I'm coming. Now, what happened? We just went to Ol' Wildoe's wedding, Mr. Fineberg. Let go of me, this is my wedding night. Lots of luck. Keep your hands off me or I'll kill you. Somebody must've thrown the cake. It was stuck all over the place like wallpaper. I'll take care of them now. So, somebody threw the wedding cake? Don't you guys know it's customary to throw rice? Now, what happened? One of 'em said something I didn't like. The soldiers called us "the Hooligan Navy," sir. And shallow water sailors. Make sure to remind me to put you all on report tomorrow. Or I might forget. Now, now, lay below before Mr. Higgins sees you. - Yes, sir. - Thank you, sir. What about me, sir? You? What are you doing here, Wildoe? There's no bridal suite in the ship. Thank you, sir. Yes.. Goodnight, sir. Why did it have to happen to you, Red of all the lousy stinking breaks. Yeah. Besides, convoy duty keeps you out six weeks at a time. Well, anyway, you'll make first class on the Algonquin. Lt. Bennett's the best. Phone up...Stella once in a while, will you? See if she's okay. I wished they had picked me instead of you. So do I. I guess, they wanted a cook, Mac. Here. I'm leaving you a souvenir. My personal recipe for cinnamon rolls. Thanks, Red. Give them cinnamon rolls for evening chow. I'm still boss here till the 5 o'clock whistle blows. That's an order. Check these supplies, Woods. Overseas ham? Ain't this stuff only supposed to be used in the tropics? Warehouse had a surplus, we got 'em cheap. Oh, sure, you got 'em cheap. 'Cause they're so salty you can't eat em. Have you gone crazy? Look at this hamburger. It's 90% sewage. Stewing and boiling meat that isn't even graded. What's going on? Powdered eggs? What are you trying to do? Take out your gripe about not retiring against the whole crew? You ought to be court-martialed for buying this slop. I refuse to accept it. You'll accept it, Woods, because I did the purchasing. And furthermore, I'm going to make out the menus personally until we wipe out the mess deficit. Now finish your inspection. Well, that's a little better. But why did you buy only three slabs of T-bone for the whole crew, sir? Enough for the General mess, Woods. Put a dozen of these steaks aside for a birthday party we're the Skipper on the 15th. The rest are for the officers wardroom mess. Coincidentally, I expect you to cater the affair. Slice it thin, chef. Slice it thin. - Gutsell. - Yes, sir. Congratulations. Now, that you're in your new position as second cook stow this garbage in the meat locker and take over the watch. That's an order. Poznicki. Stow it. That's an order. Well, here's to you.. ...and me. Al. - Pardon me. - No problem. What's the matter? Don't you talk to old friends anymore? You look busy. Oh, him? He's just a relative of Red's passing through town. I'll bet. Aren't you gonna buy me a drink? Nope. I'll leave that to Red's relative. Well, if you're gonna be that way.. I'm still glad to see you. How have you been? Okay. How's Red? He'll be away another month. Drop around. You haven't seen our new apartment yet. You're keeping Red's grandpa waiting. Hiya, Stella! - Hey, baby. - How's married life? Alright, I guess, while your husband's around. It was some wedding party you had. Only the fight sort of broke things up. Hey, we never got to kiss the bride. How about now? - Well, why not? - Better late. Cut it out, you crum. - What's it to you, cookie? - You're embarrassing her. In the pig's eye. She likes it. What's your main trouble, Woods? Jealous? I'm sorry. You okay? Yeah. You jerk. He's a relative of Wildoe's. Come on, buddy. Have a drink. Drink by yourself. Oh, come on, Stella. Just one little drink. Honesty, Frank, you're terrible. Oh, just one? Well, promise me you'll stay just for one drink. Shove off, grandpa. - Hey, what is this? - Shove off. I wanna talk to you. Honestly, you worry about me almost as much as Red does. Now, you listen to me, you've got to squared away. You're a married woman now. Can I help it if Red's away so much? I get lonesome. The poor guy got transferred. A lot of guys in the coast guard now you, Stella. You better watch your step or words gonna get back to Red. What should I do? Stay at home and twiddle my thumbs? Okay, so it's tough. But you knew he was liable to be away a lot when you married him. I didn't know how much I'd miss you, Al. Me and 16 other guys, huh, Stella? No...just you. You're the one I really want. Come in. Hey, Woods. I wanna apologize about what happened last night. I acted pretty crummy. No hard feelings. I got to thinking about how I'd feel if was married and.. ...got shipped out and someone was kissing my wife like that. Wildoe sure cooked us some pretty good meals. Yeah. This sort of ham ain't fit to eat. You give us powdered eggs once more, cookie and I'll run you through your own meat line. I'm not in charge, gripe to Woods. What's the trouble? It's the filth you've been feeding us lately. Look, cry on Higgins's shoulder. He does the buying and makes the menus. Every day, he's in here chewing me about-- My heart bleeds for you. Alright. Poznicki will pass out the crying towels. Hey, listen, Al. They know it ain't really your fault. It's just, they got nowhere else to let off steam. I know. My stomach's chewing to my backbone too. I don't blame 'em. Wait a minute. - Here's some for the family. - No, Al, I can't take it. Look, it'll get you in a jam. Skip it. It's for the kids. Well, okay. But I shouldn't. Thanks a lot, Al. It's okay. What are you trying to do? Get us shipped to Siberia? Giving away stuff when we've got orders to economize. As long as I'm the head cook, I'm running this galley. Clean up the AC room. - Yeah, but Al-- - Both of you! "Both of you. Both of you." "I'm in charge, I'm in charge." Been yelling all day. Thanks for the coffee, Al. I'm bringing back the cup. Woods. The second time I've found some your feathers in my food. And no wonder. Why aren't you wearing a hat on duty? It's hot in here...sir. If you insist on going bald, do so on your own time. Don't molt in the food. Wear a hat. Yes, sir. Sir, the crew can't do the work on the kind of chow we've been giving them lately. While I'm executive officer we're going to have an efficient ship. That means general mess is getting out of the red ink department or I'll know the reason why. Well, that's pretty serious, what he said. Ah, don't let Higgins scare you. I mean, what he said about your hair. What about it? Hey, you are beginning to molt. That means you're going bald. Bald? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm positive. Positive. The only way to stop it is to use my special preparation. We gotta shave your head. Shave my head? What kind of preparation? Something I was experimenting with before I joined up. The kind that discovers a cure for baldness and make millions. How'd you know it'll work? Look at me. Look at my hair there. Now you're on the road to recovery. Oh, no, no. Al, this is it. Doc O'Neal Hair Restorer. Hold this. Now.. Observe carefully, how I work it deep, deep, deep into the roots. Smells awful. That's the combination of onion juice and alcohol. What's onions got to do with growing hair? What do you call this? Onions are very rich in vegetable oil and that's the substance that makes vegetables grow. Hold it. Have you seen Al? Yeah, we've been lookin' all over.. A-Al. Onionhead. - Come on. Outside, you guys. - What'd you want? Well, we came to tell you, Al Higgins' just caught Ozzy takin' ashore that pound of butter you gave him. What? That's right. Higgins claims he stole it. He restricted Ozzy. He says he's gonna throw the book at him. Oh, he is, is he? Woods. And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit? Sir, it's about that-- I can't hear a word you say until you remove that hat. That's rather an extreme measure to keep from molting into the chow, isn't it? But I'm gratified you took my criticism to heart. Sir, Osborn didn't steal that pound of butter. I gave it to him. How Osborn got his hands on government property doesn't interest me. I'm only interested in one thing that it doesn't happen again. 'After we make an example of him, the other men' 'will be more careful about carrying food off this ship.' I have some notes here about the menu for the Skipper's birthday party tomorrow night. If you throw the book at Osborn, I refuse to cook for your party. Refuse? Just what do you mean? Sir, a ship's cook, third class is only supposed to cook for the general mess, according to regulations. You're turning into quite a sidler, haven't you, Woods? Yes, sir. Alright, you got me over a barrel. I'll let Osborn off this time. My deal for catering your party comes higher than that, sir. I'm asking that you approve Osborn's request to transfer to California. - Why, you.. - Yes, sir? We were talking about the transfer, sir. He'll get it. Now hear this, Woods, and note it well. From this moment forward, I'm going to be watching you every minute for one little mistake. - Is that all, sir? - Yes. Get out of my room. Thank you, sir. Fruit cup, asparagus tips celery and olives. French fries, T-bone steaks. So you chickened out, cookie. The guys were betting you'd louse up Higgins' party good tonight. Then they lose. Did you see 'em? There's a whole covey of women in the wardroom. I ain't interested. Oh, that's right. Oh, my victory garden's doin' fine. You're gonna make me a million bucks, dear Onionhead. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Turn to and start those French fries. Sure, sure, Onionhead. Poznicki, slice the bread. That was some banquet you cooked for them, Al. The Skipper sends his compliments. It's a thrill to the boys to know the food for this party's coming from their starvation diets just so Higgins can shine up to the Skipper. You should have heard Higgins when that Army Joe said that this shindig must be setting them back plenty. "Why, no, sir," he says, "No strain at all." No strain? Yeah, that's what he said. Can you imagine? And the officers only kickin' in $9.50 a month for their chow. $9.50? Are you sure? Yeah. It's in the mess ledger that Old Higgins keeps. So that's why we've been eating powdered eggs and overseas ham and that sawdust they call hamburger. The officers are eating like kings for practically nothing. Should be paying 20 bucks a month. Well, that tears it. I'm going to blow this thing wide apart. I don't know how yet, but I will. I gotta get hold of Higgins' ledger and get those figures. Now if you make it an order, maybe I can help you. That's an order. I got to obey orders. That's it. Take a look. "To the district office." Are you out of your mind? This is dynamite. The District Office will send an investigating board around. The truck's waiting for you, Osborn. Thanks. Wait a second, chief. I'd like you to read something. Don't send it. What'd I tell you? I'm tired of playing patsy for a bunch of officers. Be tired, if you don't like this ship, ask for a transfer. But never do anything that might hurt your outfit. Higgins and his wardroom gang are hurting this outfit, not me. Sure, Higgins might be a bad officer but he's not the real Coast Guard. My advice is, go to the captain with your beef. The captain? He's as bad as the rest of 'em paying $9.50 a month. You could be wrong about this, son. I still think you should send it. You better think it over, cookie. Give me a pen, somebody. I'm sending it. I don't mind being seen socially with a cook. I'm sure gonna hate to be running around with an apprentice seaman...ex-cook. Well.. Not bad, one inch in eight weeks. Didn't I tell you? Hey, Onionhead, Skipper wants to see you on the bridge. He does? Scuttlebutt has it, there's a message for you from the D.O. Oh, you and your letter. I didn't expect action from the D.O. this quick. You sure asked for it. Sir. - You sent for me? - Ah, yes. I received a radio message from the district office for you. Copy of a telegram. We'll be in port by nightfall, you can have emergency leave. Thanks, sir. Well, thanks. My name is Lester Pierce. I was Windy's best friend. I reckon you're his son. Yes, sir. We weren't sure you could get here or we would have postponed the service till you arrived. Thank you. Jo. Hello, Al. How'd you get here? How'd you know-- It was in The Clarion paper. I work for a clipping service and ran across it. I just can't get over you being here. At first, I thought it was you until I read the part about his only son being in the Coast Guard. I really don't know why I came. I guess I just wanted to see you. Jo.. Stop punishing yourself, Al. I was a worse son than he was a father. Sorry I didn't try harder. Mr. Pierce told me that pop repeated all my letters to him word for word. Truth is, I only wrote to him once the whole time I've been in the Coast Guard. He had to make-up all those other letters he wanted from me so much. I keep thinking of all that gifts, now that it's too late. I remember something Mark Twain said about his father. When I was 18, I was always embarrassed by what a fool my father was. When I was 21, I was surprised to see how much the old man had learned in three years. - Do you like Boston? - It's okay. I spend most of my time between the ship and a place called The Oval Bar. I wish you could come there. I've missed you, Jo. Oh, I missed you too. I've though so often about seeing you again. It was one of my favorite day dreams. What a pity, it had to be at a time like this. You're so beautifully it hurts. You're just a poor lonely sailor and any old girl will look beautiful to you. You're the only one I want. We're right for each other, that's obvious, isn't it, Jo? I don't really know. It was wonderful being with you. But perhaps, part of it was knowing we had so short a time. I know now, there was never anyone else for me. Never could be. - Jo, let's get married. - Not like this, Al. I want a chance to think. I love you, Jo. I love you. If you love me, what's there to think about? Now, I think I do. But no one knows when the world will end. We can be separated for a long time. People change. You might meet someone else. Board. I'm not going to leave like this. Al, please, get on the train. Then promise me you'll come to Boston soon. I don't know. I don't know. - Promise you'll wait for me. - Al, the train. Promise me, you won't say "no" till I see you again. - Nobody else till then. - Alright, I promise. I'm sure Agnelli wouldn't give me wrong steer. You have some more. - Hamburger! - Okhi. Great to see you. This calls for a drink, same thing all around. And one more. I want you to meet my old buddy, Al. - Hi, Al. - Hi. He's on the pleasure ship. The Periwinkle. - My treat. - Hey, how's Wildoe? Uh, love has slowed him down. He don't do nothing in that galley. Hey. If it ain't Old Cinnamon Rolls himself. - How are you, mate? - I'm fine. - Hello, Al. - Hi, Stella. Couple of bourbons, straight. Well, how do you think she looks for an old married lady? Very nice. Here's to you, honey. Like that sweater? I brought it back from Scotland. Great. Greatest little wife in the whole world. Insisted on coming down here to see me off. - Didn't you, honey? - Uh-huh.. Well, Red, gotta be shovin' off. - Bye, Stella. - Bye. - So long, Hamburger. - See you, Okhi. - Bye, Al. - Goodnight. - Bye. - Bye. Appreciate it if you take Stella home. I don't like to see her out alone at night. Thanks. Come on, I'll take you home. Let's dance a while, Al. For old times sake. I'm sort of bushed, do you mind? I don't mind anything you do, Al. Pardon me, miss. Haven't we met before? We met. Goodnight, Stella. Don't be like that, Al. The empty apartment always gives me the willies when Red leaves. What's the harm in having one drink with me? Okay. I'm looking for a bigger place. Can't get used to a bed in the living room. Sit down, why don't you? I'll fix up that drink. Where have you been keeping yourself? Out of trouble. Good scotch. Sweater itches me. My skin's super sensitive. Stella. - What's the matter? - Now get this straight. I brought you home as a favor to Red. You might-- Uh, I married the wrong guy. It should have been you. I don't care what you think, but love me, love me. Get away from me. Other guys've had unfaithful wives, but you're not even that. I pity Red. Al.. ...pity me. For what? For being a cheap, dirty little tramp? You think I want to be like this? Don't you think I'd like to be happy and find love like other woman? Don't you think I'd like to be satisfied with one man? You-you, don't know what it's all about. I can't help what I am. I was born this way. One look at me and every man thinks I'm made for love. Well, that's a laugh. Because I'm just the opposite. I'll never know the meaning of love. But I want to know. 'I want to know.' I really liked you, Al. I kept thinking.. ...maybe.. Maybe it would be different with you. - Stella, I-- - Beat it, Al. Let me alone. Hello. Jo. Jo, honey, darling, sweetheart. - Are you drunk, Al? - No, I'm not drunk. I had to talk to you. I need you bad, Jo darling. - Please, marry me. - Okay. I've just about made up my mind, Al. You will? You mean it? You're not kidding me, Jo? Well, it'll take me few days to get organized. Oh, Jo, honey, just hurry up and get here, will you? Hurry up, sweetheart. I'll wire you as soon as I know all the details. I love you more than anything. Well, look, hang up now. - Bye, darling. - Bye, Jo. You must have read that a million times. Most beautiful piece of literature in the English language. "Arriving, flight 209, Thursday night.." "Meet me at the airport. All my love, Jo." What can you expect from some apes doomed to a life of bachelorhood? See, that's gratitude. Me, he calls an ape. The guy who groomed that beautiful head of his so he'd look like a human. You're move, Poz. Here are the figures from Higgins' ledger. Thanks, Dave. The most our officers have paid for chow in the last six months is $9.50. Well, when they start the investigation, just remember I begged you not to send that letter out. Hey, listen to them engines. Skipper must be in a big hurry to get back. Now hear this. Now hear this. All hands, man your battle stations. This is not a drill. All hands, man your battle stations. This is not a drill. This is the captain speaking. Double lookouts on the bow, the stern, and bridge wings. The cruise mess will be ready for the emergency first aid. Wardroom will be used as a sick bay for survivors. We are proceeding on a rescue mission. The Algonquin has been torpedoed and is sinking. That is all. That sound gear gives me the creeps. Speak to the Secretary of the Navy next time you see him. How does that sound when it picks up a U-boat? - You know, Al? - No. Hope I don't find out. Object in the water. 20 degrees off the port bow. It's them. It's them. We'll have to stop dead in the water to pick them up. Make a juicy target. Contract. Bering. 124. Listen. That thing's going again. What does it mean, Al? Probably get the bounce off Algonquin. She's down here somewhere. Oh. Alright, give 'em a line. Alright, somebody help that one man up here, quick. Get him on a stretcher. Take him down to sick bay. Throw a blanket on him. - All engines ahead full. - All engines ahead full, sir. Submarine. Submarine. - Holy cow! - Hey, she's crippled. Algonquin must have hit her before she went down. Help me get the gun down. As far as she'll go. No good. Are we sinking? No. They hit the buoy deck now. Turn it loose. Aye, the way we're listing, we can use the twenty. Get another magazine. Reload, Jake. Round reload. I got it, Woods. You got them. You got them. - Right, full rudder. - Right, full rudder, sir. We're gonna ram her. Stand by to ram submarine. Come in. Sir, I'd like to speak with you, alone. I assure you, we're quite alone, Woods. 3 o'clock in the morning, I doubt if anybody else is awake. I couldn't sleep, sir. It's alright. It's okay, sit down. Care for some hot milk, Woods? - Alright, sir. - Sure. It's good hot, sir. Everybody knows you boys usually run on packs. That's why I ran them. I never thought I've to spell it out for naval board of enquiry. I had to make a split-second decision and I made it. The terrible truth is that after 20 years of saving lives I didn't want those people to live. 'So, I condemned the U-boat screwed to death' 'and I executed them.' Alright, I saw what you did up there. Saw it very clearly. You gave us the only effective firepower we had. 'You may have wounded a few Germans' 'but I killed them.' And if you have the silly insubordinate idea that you're in any way responsible get it out of your head. I alone am totally responsible for everything that happens on board this ship. Yes, sir. Something else troubling you, Woods? Sir, would you know how much it cost to feed an officer on this ship? $21 a month. But actually it costs less to feed me for obvious reasons. I guess, that's what I wanted to know, sir. This one thing that puzzles and confounds me, Woods. Yes, sir? Why does any man wanna command this ship? I wouldn't know, sir. - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. What a mess I've made of things. Poor, Jo. Nobody to meet her at the airport. She won't know what happened. I got to get word to her. She'll think I deserted her. She won't. I'll probably wind up a pot walloper on the Merman's front. Me and my big mouth. I loused up to Skipper and the whole crew with that letter. You can prove what you wrote, can't you? Yes, but I made a terrible mistake. All the time, I thought the Skipper and rest of the officers were chiseling. It was only that thief, Higgins. - What are you going to do, Al? - I don't know. I just don't know. But I wish I hadn't sent that letter. Alvin Woods. State your name, rate and present station. Alvin Woods, ship's cook third class, United States Coast Guard Periwinkle, sir. We are here to investigate the serious charges you made in the letter to the district office. Yes, sir. Let's start with your allegation that the food on this ship is sub-standard. Why should that be, Woods? We got some bad buyers from procurement, sir. Procurement is usually blamed when good food is ruined in the galley. You blame it on the quality of the food purchased. Is it? That's some of it, sir. Also, we've had to cut down on expenses. Why is that, Woods? The general mess is on a hold, sir. Can you explain how that happened? You stated that the general mess was suffering because the officers onboard were paying $9.50 a month for their food. 'Now, that's a very serious charge.' 'I assume you can prove it.' Well, sir.. No, sir. I can't. Do you mean to say, you concocted this charge without any basis and fact? I thought I knew the facts then, sir, but I was wrong. 'It strikes me, that when you sent the letter 'you were just looking around wildly for an excuse to cover up your own incompetence.' - Isn't that so? - No, sir. Woods, you've maliciously impugned the honor of your own captain and officers. More than that, you went outside of channels to do it. You could have injured the reputation of your ship. Under the circumstances, the letter you sent to the district office is in shockingly bad judgment. Before we dispose of the matters is there anything you'd like to say in your behalf? No, sir. That is all. You may go. Sheer rot. I don't believe it, sir. The board realized Woods was just trying to cover up his pathetic incompetence. - He's a congenital liar. - You're a thief. Woods, in case you don't realize that you're being transferred. So if you expect to marry that bag, I would-- Striking an officer. You saw that, Captain. Striking a commissioned officer. Stop shouting, Mr. Higgins. You fell down. Go to your cabin. You take this man's word over an officer's? I've got some checking since reserving this, Higgins. Wardroom mess has been paying you $21 a month per man. You only added half that amount on the ledger. You pocketed the difference. You're not leaving this ship until you paid back every cent. And then, I'm gonna see that you're court-martialed. But, sir you-- There is no room in the service for a man like you. Get out. Woods. You're very just and right. Being transferred to the Greenland Poole. You'll report there in five days. Ready to ship out immediately. Yes, sir. You had an excusable grievance but you should have laid your complaint before me. I know that now, sir. I appreciate the fact that when the chips were down you elected to protect your ship from scandal. Say the word and I'll go with you to the district office and explain the situation as I now understand it. Let's leave things the way they are, sir. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. I know what I'm doing... for once. Very well. I'm giving you five days leave starting as of now. Now, sir? Our restriction has been lifted. Of course, strict security concerning our recent operations still applies. Yes, sir. Next time, have faith in your commanding officer. Good luck, Woods. - And find that girl. - Yes, sir. Four days now. Four days, I've been over every inch of this town. - Where is she? - She hasn't gone back. I checked the airport, the station, the bus terminal. Nobody's seen her, I tell you that. Hey, maybe she hitch-hiked. I got an idea. Tomorrow, we'll-- Tomorrow? Tomorrow morning, I'll report to the pool. And this time tomorrow night, I'll be on my way to Greenland. Fellow was telling me they've got dames in Greenland and they're... Jo! Jo, Jo, Jo. Oh, Al. Darling, I didn't know what to do. Nobody told me anything. Where have you been? I love you. I love you. I love you, I thought I'd never find you. How'd you know about this place? I remembered you mentioning it once. I've come here every night looking for you. Oh, what a smart wife I'm going to have. Hey, Onionhead, you forgot your shoes.
