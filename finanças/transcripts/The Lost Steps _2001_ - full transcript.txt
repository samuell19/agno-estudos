The Lost Steps Monica! What? Are you challenging me? You tired him out, Monica. But he'd never admit it. Just wait: ''the best thing about those races ''is the cigarette you smoke after.'' How are the noodles? Coming along. Good. The best thing about jogging is the cigarette you have after. Dad! Oh, sorry. Really! They'll be here in an hour. Everything will be ready Ernesto. It's no good you trying to distract me, I'll win anyway. Monica looks very pretty. Going out? It is Saturday. She doesn't always go out on Saturdays. She does usually. I'm being picked up. Shall I drive you into town? No, thanks, Dad. They're picking her up. Like our daughter. Only daughters! I hope he's a sensible boy. Yes, very sensible, Dad. Perhaps too sensible. Is Luis picking you up? Yes. Your shot. When the football begins, we'll play. We can't be any worse than them. -We'll posture better at least. A coke please. -Hi how are you? A gin and tonic when you can. A rum and lemon. See you later. Hi Luis... and company. -Hi Pablo. Haven't seen you at college lately. -It's a waste of time. Let's go with them. Shall we dance? -Okay. Good evening. No, nothing. They're going home. Yes, the one called Luis. Right. See you tomorrow. Captain! Yako! Come here. Good night. Monica. Hey, Monica. Want a tea? -No thanks. What about me? Now then, whats your name? -Mireia. And daddy's name? -Pipi. And mummy's? -Vici. What about your name? -Isone Garcia. And daddy's name? -Nani. And mummy's? -Tosi. What's your name? Catalina Garcia Posada Rodriguez. And daddy's? -Miguel Garcia Posada... Rodriguez. And yours? Aitor Manona. And daddy's? -Javier. And you? What's your name? Molinuevo. -And daddy's? Daddy. So your advice again is to buy the most expensive one? In the long run it'll be cheaper. Then there's no more to say. We've always done good deals, right? -You won't regret it. It was about time you drove a real car, anyway. When will it be in? -In two days time. Excuse me. Yes? Hello... I'll attend to him now. Excuse me. Business is booming, isn't it? -We manage. The days after tomorrow. -Definitely. Bye -Bye. Melendez! -Nice to see you, Erigaray. Thanks, though I must admit it's only nice to see you when we have our hunting parties. I understand perfectly. A coffee or something? -Thanks, but no. Take a seat. Laura, no calls, please. Still do the football pools? It passes the time. You still don't like football, do you? -No. English inventions... Give me bullfighting. And hunting. And you said it was a bluff. I told you, Melendez, they'll go any lengths. They want the publicity. But we'll put them in their place. -I was half expecting it. It's outrageous having to go through this. The girl...Monica, is she in on everything? When this began some time ago, she heard something. But she was Only a child. -And now? We haven't said anything yet. You should prepare her for it. It'd be worse if someone else told her. Sorry. Hey, where's the fire? Please leave me alone. Shall I take you home? -No, I'll get the bus. Are you okay? Again! Just like my dad. -You seem strange. Monica... I'm all right! Your dad. -What? That's all I needed! Sorry, I don't know what's the matter with me. That's all right. See you tomorrow, okay? -I'll be here. Okay. Bye. Was that boy Luis? Yes. Looks like a nice boy. He is. Wasn't he in your class at high school? For 4 or 5 years. How was the nursery? Fine. Do they give a lot of trouble? They're as good as gold. You see? I bet you've forgotten all about fine art school. Were you waiting for the bus or was that boy taking you? I was taking the bus. I'm glad we met like this. You'll be home early now. You don't understand this, Ines. I don't know how to tell her this has come up again. She reacted well other times. But she was a child then. She's almost an adult now. The time when they get ideas about independence. Ideas? Delusions. Wild delusions. For God's sake, will they never give up? Stop praying! Where are the pills? Hey! Lower the window! Why do you spy on me? Why do you follow me? Ask your father. You don't know what this is all about! I'm not a child to be spied on. It's for your own safety, Monica! Am I in danger then? Why didn't you say that old woman was spying on you? Why are you having me followed? -Don't answer me with a question. I need to know. What's going on, Dad? I wanted to save you this but it doesn't seem possible. Remember that old man who said he was your grandfather? Well, he's at it again. And those old women too apparently. Does Mum know? Yes, of course. You should have told me! There are three adults in the family, not two! Can't you see we're acting just like they want us to? Arguing like this. You're right, Ines. Forgive me, forgive me the two of you. All this has made me nervous, very nervous. I'm sorry, Dad. There, there. I'm sorry too. I wasn't fair on you. Sometimes I forget you're ...a grown woman now. -Sit here and let me join in. Remember when we all used to sing? -That was a long time ago. I know it was a long time ago. But we can do it again. Come on, let's sing. I can't remember... -Come on, the one we liked best. Come on. -No. Of course you remember. Come on then... Okay. -Right. How did it go? What's that? -That's not the one! Yes... Here the revered flag, the ensign Belgrano bequeath us, when, sad, our enslaved homeland with valour its bonds severed... What is it? No, it's off. What's that? The bastard! Yes, come over, we'll be waiting. Goodbye. That was Melendez. Turn the TV on, Ines. ...as one of the victims was Spanish the Argentian writer Bruno Leardi has persuaded the High Court to accept the case. Never again! This is revolting! Never again! This time we've persuaded the court only to call Mr. Erigaray to Madrid. But that may not be the case in the future. When do you have to go? This Wednesday. I'll be with him, of course. We must ensure this is the only time. If things don't work out that way, it won't be for lack of trying on our part. I still think this is basically a publicity stunt and that we should use similar tactics. Perhaps a newspaper report with the ladies... Show them at home, with statements calling for calm. I don't think so. Their pictures everywhere... Just a suggestion. We have friends in the press too. Does Monica know about Leardi? I do. Good. Aren't you exaggering? -They have influence, Monica. How else could they have managed to accuse a simple mechanic? -They can make up whatever they like but this it too much. I'm not a puppet. They're after your father through you. Look, I'm of age, I live with my parents because I want to, and I'll go on doing so. Whatever they do. These people are sick. Well, you and Dad decide what to do. Come on, Mum. Your mother and I love you so much. Of course, Dad. I know you do. Remember how scared you were of the priest at your First Communion? You were always afraid, not like now that you're a woman. A brave woman. You were even afraid at bath time. I was thinking... When this is all over, I want us all to go away on holiday. A luxury holiday... Although you may not want to go with two old fogeys, and you'd prefer your friends. I've got time for them the rest of the year. Anyway, I'd be with the handsomest man in the world. Ready! It's Saturday and look at those long faces. You're right. Wait a minute. Here's to the Erigarays! Cheers! -Cheers! Cheer up or I'll get Luis to come and pick me up. Isn't he coming like every Saturday? No. I told him I was staying in to do some studying. The Cortinas and Rebollos asked us to dinner but we said no too. So you aren't going out tonight? No. And no football for you. Family night tonight! Fine. -Let's have another toast. Cheers. Cheers. -Cheers. It's delicious. Come on, my Spanish girl! Bravo! The first thing I did in Buenos Aires was learn to dance. I had lessons. -But learned properly from me. Well, perhaps... Come on. -I don't know how! Come and dance. -Yes, go on. I'll see to the food. Let's see if you remember. Monica... What do you think about your father's summons? Tell us... -Out of the way! Has Bruno Leardi got in touch with you? What do you and your parents think? Just a few words, Monica... They've gone. But... that woman's there again. Hey! What? Bothering people again! Got nothing better to do? I'm doing what I think is right. -Do it somewhere else! There's nothing for you here. Give people some peace! -That's exactly what we want to do. Bitch! You should see a psychiatrist! -And you have a blood test. Yes, that's what you are...bloodsuckers! Hi Monica. I'd like to talk. I'll wait in the car. -Okay. Don't let all that's happening get to you. Act as always. Some people gloat over others' misfortune. But I'm on your side. That's what friends are for. I didn't know we were friends. I'd like to change that. You can count on me. For anything. Why? Can't you see? Because I like you. I can't have two boyfriends. Leave the other. He's a caveman. He's a gentleman. Let him ride off on his horse then. I just wanted to make it clear that I'm on your side. Come what may. There's only one thing... But, thanks anyway. ...and this afternoon attempts by Erigaray's lawyer to postpone his client's appearance in court failed. Erigaray will therefore have to appear tomorrow morning. Oh yes, sir, Erigaray, killer and torturer. Oh yes, sir, Erigaray, killer and torturer. According to documents in my possession, Erigaray was one of the armed men who the night of 13th July 1979 burst into the home of my son, Diego Leardi, and abducted him along with my Spanish born daughter-in-law. Sara Pereira, and their daughter, my granddaughter, Diana Leardi. They're listed as detained disappeared. Statements by survivors claim that Erigaray ran a Clandestine Detention Centre. where it was common practice to torture prisoners... The prosecution claims this is a new case of abduction of children by those directly responsible for the repression during the dictatorship. in a case similar to those other children whose true identity was proved years later thanks to DNA testing. We've located three couples in Spain who stole the children of couples who disappeared. Our investigations led us to Madrid, to Catalonia and to one other place also in Spain... The poet Bruno Leardi is convinced that this is yet another... This is ready. The TV's so boring! The same programmes as in Argentina years ago. Yeah. Hello? Hello Ernesto. Yes, I know. How are they? Come back as soon as you can. We both miss you. Yes, she's here. It's Dad. Hello. Yes, fine. Monica, take care, dear. You know how your father gets about the car. Miriam? Hello. I don't feel too well. Mind if I don't come in today? I'll ring you later and we'll talk. Take care. Bye. Fucking hell! Fifth course went in fifteen minutes ago. They won't be out til eleven at least. ''Leardi seeks granddaughter...'' ''Death flights...'' ''The witness, who spent two years in the detention centre, said ''...that Erigaray tortured the prisoners there and that every Wednesday...'' ''a group was chosen, drugged, put onto a'' ''plane and dropped into the River Plate.'' ''Diana Leardi Pereira,'' ''abducted''' ''from her home on 13th July 1979'' ''by security forces'' ''with her parents, Diego Leardi and Sara Pereira.'' Hi. Hi. Thanks for the other day... Don't mention it... I meant it. What are you doing? Some work. I'll be off then. Luis will be out soon. He's lucky, that... That what? -That kid. See you then. Your name isn't Monica. How many times have they been wrong? I don't know. As I see it, all they want is to fuck your father up. One way or another. Now they're bringing in the dictatorship. They're serious charges. -Are you silly or something? They wouldn't just accuse him of foul play at football. They've never told me about Argentina. They must want to save you the details. Your father's got a strong character. He must have enemies. He came here so that you could all be left alone. They won't forgive him for it. Maybe. That's how it is! ''Sling mud and some will stick.'' An old trick. Don't you see? If they can make you have doubts, they win. Talk to your folks. Things are probably much simpler than they seem. Look, here it is. I thought I'd lost it with the others. Or that your grandmother had burnt it with those papers. Look. Remember? Vaguely. But was Dad a mechanic or a soldier? He always liked cars. He was a driver. When you were born he worked at the military vehiles depot. Look. Remember? This one's familiar. -You've seen them 1,000 times! I remember us going to the workshop sometimes. That's right. Why did he leave? To get on. You know how he is. He wanted the best for us. And there's no denying that he succeeded. There was a lot of trouble in Argentina. All politics and no work. He wasn't happy earning a pittance and things were going badly. No, try this one on. Like this? No? -No. Better without a bra, don't you think? Why? You'll be warmer with one on. Mum...? -Yes? Why didn't you have more kids? The doctor told me not to. Your birth had complications. He said it would be dangerous. But you and Dad still... What? You know...still made love. Goodness me! The things you say! Tell me. Your father's a man and I'm a woman. I may be very conservative and Catholic but I'm still a woman... The things you say! And before you married? No! He took me out to dance the tango. He used to hold me like this, very close... ''Ah, its so easy to lead you, my little Ines.'' Will this lead to a trial? Will Monica have to declare? All I'll say is that I'm very happy to be back. with my family. I'm going to try and forget all this infamy. That's all. That's it, thank you. Will Monica have a blood test? -Monica, will you take a DNA test? So you'll both have to go to Madrid to testify. They want you to take a blood test, Monica. I don't mind. Let them do it and then leave us alone. You have a right to refuse. We have to make things clear but without being imposed on. I don't need proof of anything, but they'd leave us alone. It would be a terrible humiliation. As if they'd beaten us. They can't make you. Here the law protects you. But what can they say? -Anything, dear... Just as they're doing now. Anyway, you sit down and I'll serve. Shit! Never mind, dear. Damn it! Well then, let start again. Dad, you chop the onion. I'll do that. Would you like another whisky? No thanks. Don't drink so much. And don't be so peevish. I don't understand. I just don't understand. They see things differently. -But what about me! It's only a fucking blood test! The results would be conclusive! What are they scared of? -Be fair, Monica. Be fair? They're having a bad time but what about me? I'll do it without telling them! And that's it. -No, no. You're not alone. This needs teamwork. -Yes, let's talk football! Don't drink any more. Don't be a pain. I'm going! I don't want to be a pain. Shall I take you home? No, I want to be on my own. That's how I am anyway. Monica! That's not fair. No, I'll pay. Bye. Look... Don't go away angry. See you tomorrow, okay? -Shall I take you? No, forget it. You stay. Get some rest... and think things through. -Bye. I don't care who you are... but how you are. Have you got a car? -Yes, my dad's. Till I get my degree. Give me a lift. -Sure. Son of a bitch! Fucking bitch! You like running, don't you? How did you know? You've no idea what I know about you. What else do you know? You wear black panties. Right then, I'll race you. A race? Yes, here along the beach. All right. Ready? -Ready. To that boat. -Right. One... two... three! What is it? -I slipped. Breathe deeply through your nose. All right now? - A bit more. You're okay. I dare you to swim. -What? No balls! No need for them. They'd get in the way. Come on then. Take me home? And if I say no? We'd better go. Not for me, but okay. You couldn't put out any fires now. -You're wicked. Yes, I think. I am wicked. Let us pray to God through Jesus Christ, His eternal son, to intercede on our behalf. We pray to Thee, oh Lord, succour those who are experiencing times of difficulty due to those who love defamation more than they love You. You who expelled men from the temple, do not allow intruders who, in their own interests and in the name of morality and family values would do harm to a united Christian family who, with their friends, have trust in and command themselves to You. Hear our prayer. Hear us, we pray. ''To my granddaughter'' by Bruno Leardi. ''How could I forget you, for I saw you. ''when still you could not walk, you with those smiling eyes'' ''fixed on me, silently saying: forget me not? How could I forget you, for your smile came from another child who years before, I had rocked. For through your eyes that sweet, impossible woman looked out at me? How, for I cannot forget the slaughter I did not see, when bad faith, armed, tore away those who brought you into the world, who were unable to see you turn into a girl and then a woman, or even the shattering of all their dreams? What am I saying? No! Not while you are alive, you, their final dream. Not while I, in my quest for you, have the breath that was taken away from them.'' Through Jesus Christ... Amen. Matilde, nice to see you. Doctor, thank you so much for coming. How do you do? Look... -Thanks very much. As I said, he'll answer a few questions now, but please make them short. Bruno. He's tired after the trip. Of course. There'll be more statements tomorrow. Hello, thank you for coming. What can you tell us? Basically what you already know...I'm here to testify about the abduction of my son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Mightn't your claims, however justifiable, do the girl a lot of harm? Diana, who's 23 now, is entitled to know who she really is and then take the decision. I haven't come to claim her as family, but I do believe that just as I have a right to my own background and past, so too does Diana. Apart from the hearing, will you contact the girl you think is your granddaughter? Just a little...no, no, no... Okay...where's that dummy? Sylvia was as small as that baby when they took her. -But better behaved, Gran. More or less. Sure I can't help? Really. Sit on that chair and wait. Sylvia, bring the beer in, love. How's it going with Silvia? I can't stand it. She sees everything as a threat to her independence, especially me. And, of course, I'm always around. Silvia, what about that beer? Here it is. Are you dying of thirst...? Thank you, Silvia. She's such a pain! All the fuss lately... No, she's always like this. Thank you. Silvia... Go ahead, I'm all ears. You know what worries me... I... How was it knowing those people weren't your parents and coming to Spain with your gran? It was strange, although it was also a relief... But in any case I had a feeling something was wrong. Perhaps some vague memory mnade me realise. Didn't they love you? Not in a warm way. Has the way things went affected you? Any regrets? Gran did what she had to do. After they abducted my parents she never rested. She had to fight to get me back. She's a real pain... but she's my gran. Well, there's supper. I expect a certain person was running me down... The centre of the universe. I'll serve the first course. It's your daughter, Diego. She's your image, Sara. Your image. Leave us alone! Go away! I can assure you in a confrontation with my husband, you'd come out the worse. But if you go near my daughter... -Madame... You know she's not your daughter... but my granddaughter. Go away, I'll tell you! Oh, Diana, Diana, Diana. I know you! I can see. May I? Have you come for Monica? -No, I've come for Diana. Had any trouble? -No, but I don't rule it out. Tell me something, do you know Luis? Yes. He's a caveman. He's been going out with Monica since high school. What else? A strong character? Luis? -No, no. Her. You're telling me! You would think so at first but when she gets an idea in her head... How's she coping with this? She's suffering. She clings to her family, but it's all she thinks about. It must be hard to face up to. Do you think she'd like to see me and talk? I front of you if she preferred. I don't think she'd like the idea. You know, some terrible things will come out in court. I can try... I'll try... Are you completely sure she's Diana? Mr. Erigaray? -Have you an appointment? What can you lose? Why not hear what he has to say? -He's mad! He's doing us all a lot of harm. Then only you can persuade him to leave you alone. He won't stop until... -I'm not scared of him. I just don't want to think about any more! The civilised thing to do is talk, isn't it? All right, dear? Of course I am. Luis, would you take Monica home? -Let's go Monica. We're not going anywhere. What is this? Please, Monica, do as I say. And you... Don't stick your nose in other person's business. I don't. Now tell me where Leardi is! I don't know, and I wouldn't tell you anyway. Talk, fuck it! Talk! What is this? -Go, Monica! I have to go. -Where? Come on, tell me. Where's Leardi? Bastard! Where's Leardi? Don't hit him! -Monica! Where is he? Talk, fuck it! The Hotel Tiro! Luis, take her home. Let's go. Hello? Who is this? Tell him I've not time to talk to murderers. Another time. Won't he see me? -No, sir. Wait for me here. No, you'd better go up. Tell him if he doesn't get lost, or if he bothers Monica again, I'll kill him. Go on. Mr. Erigaray wants you out of town. Now, you clown! And if you bother his daughter again, he'll send you to hell to join your fucking son. Got it? And don't hide behind those kid. It's them who get the shit. beat out of them. Is Pablo there please? Bruno Leardi. Tell him I need to speak to him please. It's important. Hello? -No, it's nothing. They know where you are. Have they been? Don't worry. They've gone now. Did they lay hands on you? Didn't look like hands... No, I shan't report it. It's not important. Yes, I talked to her...but we were interrupted, especially me. Pablo... This may not make sense now, but some time in the future. and here in Madrid, Monica will be Diana again. She may not be interested in me, but I'm sure that ultimately, she'll need a boyfriend... A boyfriend who's not a caveman. Good luck. Monica, open the door, please I only want to say goodnight. Come on, darling. Goodnight, Mum. Won't you let me in for a while? I've got a bad headache. We'll talk tomorrow. Goodnight, dear. Sleep tight. Well? She's got a bad headache. Not surprising, is it? Did she let you in? Of course she did... I'm her mother. She's not angry with me. Is she in bed? Yes. She let me tuck her in. Like I used to. What's your name? What's your name? Monica What? -Monica. Very good! -Monica what? Monica Erigaray. Very good! Very good! And what's daddy's name? Ernesto. Ernesto what? -Ernesto Erigaray. Very good? And mummy's? Wait a minute. What about you? What's all your name? Mon... What's your name? Monica. Monica what? Erigaray. Very good! And what's mummy's name? Ines Laro... Laroche. -Laroche. Very good! Very good. -Fine! Where's daddy? -Here. And mummy? -Here. Very good. -Now again. What's your name? Monica. Monica...? -Monica Erigaray. And daddy's name? Ernesto. Erigaray. And mummy's? Ines Laroche. Very good! -Very good! Very good! And now let's sing a song. Me first, then you, then Mummy. All right? Right then. Here... The revered flag, the ensign Belgrano bequeathed us, when, sad, our enslaved homeland its bonds severed. Here the splendorous flag... Fine! Very good! Will this ever end? Monica... You've no idea the things I have to keep inside, that I have to keep to myself. What things? Things... A lot of things. Out of respect for my husband, and love for my family. Want to tell me? You wouldn't understand. Why not try? They're silly, married-woman things... You'll know one day. Don't drink so much, Mum. Do you miss Luis? I'm going to my room to eat. Going down to dinner? Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. I'd like to see Mr. Bruno Leardi. Who shall I say? -Monica Erigaray. Erigaray? -Erigaray. Mr. Leardi, this is reception. There's a Miss Erigaray to see you. Mr. Leardi? Just a moment. Do you want him to come down? I'll go up. Mr. Leardi, Miss Erigaray will come up. Not at all. Room 532, the lifts are that way at the end. Thank you. I won't play this game I am not your granddaughter. I want you to know I love my parents And I'll do anything to protect my family. That's just what I want to do... protect my family. When I saw you at the nursery, I knew I was right. You're a little older than Sarah was when they took her but you're her image. The same face, the same lovely smile... All it needs is for you to scratch your back like mad every night as she did. Ines and Ernesto are my parents. They've always looked after me and were only interested in my welfare. Your granddaughter couldn't say the same about her parents who ran all sorts of risks. Diego and Sara didn't abandon their daughter. She was taken from them. I know this sounds terrible but Erigaray ran the concentration camp they were taken to. There are accounts of torture and killing there. And of children being kept. But it was war... I can't help it if your son and my father were on different sides. You can find out who you are with a simple blood test, and then do whatever you wish. I can't take you away from them against your will. But I've no doubts whatsoever. And neither will you if you see these. What good are pictures to me? All kids look the same! Do you like art? Sara didn't like it at all. You see? That's what I like most of all. She didn't. She only liked chemistry and politics. And Diego poiitics and more politics. I hate politics and chemistry. I only like art. Just like my mother. But you don't study art or do anything connected with it. So what? Because I work... Though it is my hobby. I must insist about the photos. Best if you see them now, because you'll have to see them at the hearing. Please. You've nothing to lose. MAGISTRATES COURT Never again! Never again! They took me to a place they called ''The Cesspit.'' It was an old garage. They tortured me every day for months. I was always blindfolded. They didn't want me to see them. They hung me up with my arms tied behind me... They gave me electric shocks and beat me for hours on end. They called the one who interrogated me ''The Toad''... While he beat me, he'd whistle to music played full blast on a record player. Once the blindfold slipped, and I saw his face clearly. 6 months later, after I was freed, I identified him from the photographs. Can you tell us how you did that? Yes. When I was freed, I contacted the Mothers and Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo. I told them about all I'd been through and what I'd seen at the ''The Cesspit.'' They showed me some pictures of people suspected of torture abduction and murder. I recognised ''The Toad'' in several of them. The man you recognised in the pictures as The Toad... Is he in the room? -Yes. Would you point to him? Thank you. You may go on. In mid-July 1979, after an operation. that had made them very edgy, a couple and a child came in. ''The Toad'' brought the woman, Sara Pereira, and her child of 18 months. Sara had a very deep head-wound and she'd lost a lot of blood. The baby cried and cried We cried out for a doctor, but they never listened to us. Sara went into a coma. ''The Toad'' himself brought food and napkins for the baby. The next day he took her away. All the time, Diego Leardi called out. for his wife and daughter. Then one day he was transferred and we never heard of him again. Does the defence wish to question the witness? No, my lord, no questions. Although we do wish to express our surprise at the witness's delay, almost 18 years, in making her accusations. By your leave, I'll now question Mr. Leardi. Council has leave to do so. Thank you, my lord. Mr. Leardi can you tell the court what led you to believe that Ernesto Erigaray and Ines Laroche, abducted your granddaughter, and registered her under the name Monica Erigaray? When the witnesses contacted me, I tried to find out who Erigaray's ''daughter'' was. I obtained a picture of her, and received a shock. I was sure that those big, rather sad eyes were my granddaughter's. We're not here for your works of fiction. Quiet, Mr. Melendez! I tried to get a copy of Monica's birth certificate but it wasn't possible then. I perservered and managed to get one in 1985. From it I saw that Monica's birth was recorded, illegally, two years after she was born. But missing were papers issued at every birth: a doctor's certificate, the names of the witnesses and the person who recorded... You don't need to go on! I don't care what happened! -Miss Erigaray! Go on, Mr. Leardi. Those papers were unobtainable because they weren't in the register and, as I remember, we were told they'd been mislaid or something. Later I was given certain information which led me to the Clinical Antartida where, in 1973, Mrs. Ines Laroche had been admitted, for ''removal of the womb'', according to the records. That's a lie! That isn't true! Quiet, Miss... And I swear to God that they are my parents! I don't care what they've done! It was war, right! And people die and get killed! Why! Why have you done this to me? The court is adjourned. You may all leave, except the young lady. The wooden box is in here. Anything missing? Monica. The court has released Ernesto Erigaray and his wife Ines Laroche on bail. Both must report to the judge every day until they are tried for the abduction, torture and death of the Spanish citizen Sara Pereira, the abduction of Diana Leardi and the usurpation of her identity. I'm sorry, we can't talk now, we have to go. Sorry. And the results of the DNA test taken by Monica prove that she is not the Erigarays' daughter but Diego Leardi and Sara Pereira's, who were murdered in Buenos Aires 20 years ago. Any news of her? She's living at the nursery owner's place. That's all I know... -And she doesn't want to see me. If I stayed on a few days..? -No, I don't think so. Some time will have to pass. -As always. Cai I write to you? I'll send you my address. ...to Buenos Aires now boarding... Buenos Aires One year later. This house beloned to my parents and I'd love to see it. They lived here. You see. All right, of course.
