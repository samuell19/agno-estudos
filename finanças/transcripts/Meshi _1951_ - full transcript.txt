TOHO PRODUCTIONS Participant in 26th Year of Showa Era Arts Festival, 1951 REPAST Based on the original novel by Fumiko Hayashi Scenario Supervisor: Yasunari Kawabata Cast: Ken Uehara Setsuko Hara Yukiko Shimazaki Yoko Sugi, Akiko Kazami Haruko Sugimura Ranko Hanai Director: Mikio Naruse "I am moved by the sadness to be found in the simple lives of people... "...in the limitless space of the universe." Fumiko Hayashi This is a neighbourhood on the south side of Osaka. It says "city" on the map, but it's actually more like the suburbs... ...with a little local railway station. Nearby, there's a forest with a shrine... ...and numerous meandering alleyways... ...all basking in the early morning sun. Watch how you go. Oh, dear. - Morning. - Good morning. Darling! Yuri? Yuri? Yuri! I got married to the man I loved in Tokyo five years ago. Two years later, we moved to Osaka as my husband got a transfer I was full of hope and dreams then. Where did they go? My husband sits at the table. And I bring bowls of soup back and forth. Yesterday, today, tomorrow... Three hundred and sixty-five days a year, every single morning... ...and every single evening. Must every woman's life be wasted in the daily routines... ...of the kitchen and the dining room? Oh, Yuri! There you go. - Is my breakfast ready yet? - Coming. That imported rice smells different. Don't read while you're eating, will you? The stock prices are showing a steady increase I suppose some of your colleagues have made profits. Probably. But some will have made losses, too. You work for a brokers but don't deal in stock yourself? - Good morning. Rice for sale. - Not today, thanks. My husband has lost his job again. Please buy some I'm ever so sorry, but we've plenty I see. Some other time, then. - But we need some, don't we? - Yes, but... - How much is it? - 160 yen. Far too expensive. Some street peddler stole a basin from Mrs Yoshida across the street. No news ever surprises you, does it, dear? Sometimes. The clock's stopped again. It's no good. I'll have to buy a new one. OBATAKE BROKERAGE - Good morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Good morning, sir. Morning. - Good morning. - Morning. You're a smart dresser. Were they expensive? No, I got them cheap. You're doing well for yourself. Hardly. I can't even afford cigarettes anymore. You should make some money from stocks, Okamoto, for your beautiful wife. I hope it's not a cold. - Good morning. - Good morning to you. - Are you off out? - Yes I'm going to pray for my son at the temple at Amagasaki. He's got examinations for work. He needs the Buddha's blessing. That's very thoughtful of you. Well, a son is a son. Good morning. Good day. "Morning"? It's almost noon I suppose mistresses can sleep late, can't they? Yoshitaro, bring your friend round again, won't you? For mahjong? Are you visiting somebody? I'm looking for the Okamotos' house. The Okamotos are over here. Mrs Okamoto! You have a visitor! - Who's that? - My husband's niece from Tokyo. She's very pretty, isn't she? Excuse me. - Surprised to see me? - What's happened? I left home. Well, you better come in. Yoshitaro! - You managed to find us, then? - I'm good at finding places. Do you want a nap? You must be tired. I slept well on the train. You're so easy-come-easy-go! So, tell me, what happened? - How's my uncle? Has he changed? - Well... I can't wait to see him again. What time does he get home? Late? It depends on his work. I'll give him a call, shall I? Hey, Yoshitaro! Where do you think you're going? - Surprise! - What are you doing here? Welcome home. She says she's left home. - Eh? - I'm not a kid anymore. - You left secretly? - Naturally. I bet your parents are worried I wired them. She's having second thoughts about marriage. Do you think that they've received the wire already? Missing them already? It's the first time I've done this. Just don't make a habit of it! What a surprise! I can't believe you're old enough to get married, Satoko! - You're very pretty. - No way! I bet Tokyo's changed. I miss Tokyo... Plenty of new houses must've gone up in your neighbourhood. Lots! It's really bustling. We've three movie theatres near the station. Really? I'd love to go back... When you first got married, you lived in my house. You were so happy. I envied you. Do you still play the samisen like you used to? No. I have no time for music anymore I'm starving. Let's eat. How long do you think she'll stay? Just give her time. Yes, but... My brother's a teacher and very strict, too! Let's just give her a break. - Will there be enough? - What, rice? - Yes. - We'll be all right. She can go sightseeing in Osaka by bus. - Do you fancy it, too? - What? You haven't had a tour around the sights of Osaka. Well...how much is the fare? It can't be that expensive. Let's go next Sunday, yeah? If you say so. - Where's my handkerchief? - Oh... There. Is my lipstick all right, Hatsu? Not too thick, is it? Just call me "uncle". - How old are you now? - 20. That tie's a bit tatty! Don't you have a better one? - Haven't you finished clearing up yet? - No... I fixed my hair myself. Does it look funny? Come on, get ready. - I won't go. - Why? I got three tickets especially. Come with us! The tickets are returnable. The two of you go. Why? I've got too much to do. Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to depart. Now that we're sharing the same bus, I hope we can all be friends. Please relax and enjoy the sights of Osaka I hope you have a lovely time. I think I might've upset your wife. Not at all. The stone building that you can see to your left is the Osaka Stock Market. This area is called Kitahama and is known for its brokerages. It's famous as the counterpart of Tokyo's Kabutocho. Where's your office? You can't see it from here. Maybe I could find work here in Osaka. And what about your marriage? Who cares? Ladies and gentlemen, please take in the beautiful view to your left. This view is one of the most famous sights that Osaka has to offer. O the beautiful plum blossoms... That's a traditional song about the park, there... and the park is famous for a lane... ...where one sees lovers walking arm in arm. Let's go walking there together. Oh, you can see Osaka Castle! "Naniwa is like a dream beyond a dream... "Let us recall the life of the warrior hero who died aged 63..." - What do you think she earns? - She'll hear you! This is the second largest rock... ...used in the construction of the walls of the castle. The man that I'm in love with is penniless. Rich men aren't my type at all. Which should I choose? Forget about money. Just marry for love. Love gets you nowhere if you can't even pay the bills. Love gets me nowhere. "Love gets you nowhere"? You know what, I earn 6,000 yen a month. I have to give my parents 3,000. I need to make more. You know what I get? How much? Hello, Mrs Okamoto? - I'm back. - Thank you so much. The pawnbroker refused your samisen, though it's of high quality. Thank you for your trouble. Here, this is your share. Really? Well, thanks very much. Did your son manage to get a job? Not yet. He wants to work at a pharmaceuticals factory... ...but 280 men applied for the job when they want only three. - Gosh! - I think his chances are slim. He's not even a college graduate. Poor people's sons just get poorer. Education seems to make no difference. - Life is so hard lately. - I agree. What's the girl from Tokyo up to? My husband took her to see the sights. That's very nice of him. Why didn't you go along, too? What do you want to eat? Well... "VIPER" RESTAURANT So, "Viper" means grilled eel? I thought it really meant snake! - You really shock me, you know? - Why? Wanting to be a dancer! Guys like me, we just don't understand girls your age. Is that so? You should get married quickly. Hatsu, is married life really that good? Married life? Well... It's good. But staying single's good as well. Isn't that a contradiction, though? The world is full of contradictions! - Another bottle! - You're ordering more? I'm in the mood for another. We could drink at home. Why do men always drink outside the home? Beer doesn't taste as good when your wife's moaning at you. Is Michiyo like that? Are you scared of her? "Dear Michiyo, hope married life is treating you well. "It's been six months since we all got together. "Our old classmates are getting together at Seiko's restaurant... "The place is called 'Yuranosuke's' on the corner of Yamatoya Street..." How many classmates are there in your group? - Five. - You still keep in touch with them? Yes. It's only 100 yen for lunch. What kind of place is "Yuranosuke's"? It's the restaurant where my friend Seiko got married. - Expensive? - Yes I've no kimono to wear for the occasion. A Western-style suit will do I've no suit either... YURANOSUKE'S - Michiyo! - Long time no see! It's been a long time. You look beautiful as ever! Not at all! Life as a housewife now revolves around cooking and cleaning. Where did you get that suit made? This? I've had it since I got married. But the colour is lovely. Don't you agree? Now that I've seen Michiyo, I'll have to return home. Why? I have seven guests arriving tonight... ...and I can't leave preparations to the maids. You must excuse me. - Enjoy yourselves. - Are you leaving so soon? - Forgive me. I'll see you again soon. - Oh, no! - Go home, then, you killjoy! - Bye! - She said it's 100 yen for the lot! - So cheap. It's Seiko's treat I'd say she can afford it with a place like this. Since when did you smoke? A spinster has to kill time some way. Find a passionate lover, then! I can't... I'm depressed. I suppose I could trade my piano for a sewing machine. Will one of you take my piano? - I envy you. - Why? Why should a happy wife like you envy an old maid like me? We still have four old classmates together! Oh, how I miss speaking my Tokyo dialect. Come on inside. - Where should we sit? - Sit anywhere you like. It must be nice enjoying life with just you and your husband. You've lost weight. You're not pregnant, are you? Not at all. Life is hard I'd give anything to have just one day alone with my husband. What do you talk about together? I have a cat. What an answer! Will you keep me company this afternoon? I won't let you go home! You look so happy. Really? Do you really think I look happy? Of course! On your own? Why don't you come over? Thanks. But I'm house-sitting. Where's your aunt? I haven't walked along here like this for I don't know how long I'd hate to part company with you now. Why don't we have some tea? That's the first good coffee I've had in ages. Oh, don't sound so sorry for yourself! It's getting late. Shall I call your husband? No, I'll call him. Hello, dear. We've finished our lunch I'm just with Miss Doya. Eh? I see. No, take your time and enjoy yourself. I asked Satoko to prepare supper for you. Bye. Michiyo! - Long time... - Long time no see. - When did you get here? - Yesterday I've been ill recently, so I've taken some leave. - But you look so well. - My brother likes to loaf around! - On your own? - No, I'm with a friend. - Come round to the house some time. - I will, I will. We'll be expecting you. - Who's that? - My cousin. He's a banker in Tokyo. He's nice. Shall we go? - Goodbye. - See you soon. Michiyo looks as beautiful as ever. She's lost weight. Give up. She's married I'm home! Satoko? Ties are so expensive, aren't they? For your husband? - This one? - Maybe... - Can it be a gift from me? - No. Satoko? Satoko? - Care for some tea? - OK. Get up, then. Help me up. You're heavy. - I've got a nosebleed! - Lie down. - Don't move. It's not that serious. - No? Do you feel ill? You let the thief run off with your dad's shoes! What's wrong? My husband's shoes have been stolen I've never heard anything like this happening round here. He'll have to go to the office wearing sandals tomorrow I'm sorry to hear that I'm back. What's wrong? - My shoes have been stolen. - No... I'd just popped upstairs and... - Wasn't the front door locked? - I must've left it open. You only bought them a few days ago. Wasn't Satoko in? We were upstairs. Both of you? What were you doing upstairs? - What is it? - I had a nosebleed I see... What kind of a thief steals from poor people like us? Maybe it's divine retribution. Retribution? - What've you done with the towel? - I used it on Satoko's nosebleed. Oh, no! - Why are you angry with me? - Because you're sloppy. So is Satoko. She didn't bother cooking any supper. It's not her fault she had a nosebleed. - So it was bleeding all evening, then? - Don't be daft! I'm starving. When's supper ready? That's all you ever say to me when you see me: "I'm starving". Is that her blood? Yeah. I was taking some tea up to her when the nosebleed started. How thoughtful of you! Don't be stupid. Have you ever considered how I feel... ...having to work in this house day in and day out? Is this all that marriage is? I slave from morning till night... ...washing, cleaning, cooking... ...never going out, nothing to look forward to. I want to go back to Tokyo and find some work I can't go on like this Yuri, where've you been? Have you missed me? Are you hungry? A good couple should quarrel from time to time... ...even if you're in love! My husband just sits there in silence while I shout and complain. Men are impossible to deal with! It's like torture. Women can only be happy and proud of themselves when they're young. It's hard going! Goodbye. Welcome home. - Have you been over at hers? - She invited me in. She's from Tokyo I don't have much to do with her I know. Miss Kanazawa said she'd like to be friends with you. She's a mistress. Do you know that? It doesn't matter to me. She runs a small bar on Shinsaibashi Street. She said I could go and work for her. - There's your 8,000 yen. - Thank you. It's unusual for you to request an advance I lost my shoes. The wife went mad at me. Too bad. Let's have a drink tonight. I have an interesting offer for you. Hello? Hello? Is Marugaki there? It's me. What? With Okamoto? Are you sure? Let's meet at six. Remember it's a coincidence that I'm coming. Understand? Do you know a lady named Ryu Kanazawa who lives near you? She's my neighbour. - Your neighbour? - Why? Her patron is actually Marugaki's son. I didn't expect to see you here. - What a coincidence. - It's good to see you I've wanted to talk to you for a while, Okamoto. Now that he's turned up, let's make a real evening of it. Don't worry, the drinks are on me tonight. CABARET CENTRE METRO I think you're going to enjoy it here. You look like someone famous. You can't seduce him. He has a beautiful wife. That's too bad. In short, we're trying to get backing for a venture with Towa Industries. But the finance that Marugaki's brokerage has raised isn't enough. We want your backing, too, you see? I can explain to you the details of the scheme later in writing. We can't do it alone. You can help us, you and your company... ...and get your relative Takenaka on board, too. Hey, more beer! - No, make it a highball! - No...thanks. Stay and keep us company tonight. It's good to let a beautiful wife worry occasionally. Yeah! I'm fine, I'm absolutely fine. A little drunk, maybe. Good night. - That's your neighbour's. Yours is there. - Really...? One...two...three... Fourth one along. This is your house. And there's mine, opposite. Bye-bye! Thanks a lot. Hey! It's me! Hey! Hey... ...I've been to this amazing place tonight. It was a real high-class place with loads of dancers. It was packed with all kinds of people. The world is full of wonders. Full of wonders... Watch how you go! Oh, dear. - Morning. - Good morning. Darling! What's all that money for in your pocket? Eh? Oh, it's an advance. What do you need an advance for? I need new shoes. And you need some money, don't you? I can manage the housekeeping without it. Satoko might need some spending money. Satoko? Is that right? - Finished with the paper? - Yeah. WANTED: OFFICE GIRLS No way! Don't be fooled. It's a waste of money. - What kind of salary are they offering? - I've no idea I reckon 4,000...5,000 at the most. Is that all? Osaka employers are shrewd. They make you do long hours for little money. Anyway, let me show you around the interesting parts of Osaka. Fancy a drink? No. And you're underage anyway! Well, I didn't mean any harm. - We can just stroll along together. - Stroll where? I don't know! What are we going to do with her? Do you think she could be at Miss Kanazawa's bar? I don't know... You're late. What happened? I had a few drinks. Sorry. - Where were you? - Here and there. Yoshitaro showed me around. I left him and went to Miss Kanazawa's bar. She wanted to go on to somewhere else afterwards. Miss Kanazawa was insistent, but I refused I thought that you'd be worried about me. What kind of an uncle would I be if I didn't worry about you! Do you get up to such tricks in Tokyo? I don't get up to any tricks! I'm not a child anymore I was fine. I was just curious and wanted to have a look around. It's dangerous, though. You might run into trouble on the streets. Trouble can find you when you least expect it... What's wrong? Are you crying? Michiyo will think something's happened to you. - Michiyo's mad at me, isn't she? - Eh? She scares me. She doesn't scare anybody! I wish I could stay here with you like this. So, you're off to Tokyo? It's all very sudden. How long will you be away? I suppose you must miss your mother a great deal. - Just be sure to come back soon. - Yes. I was wondering if you could lend me some money. You can hold onto my samisen. You don't need to offer me any collateral for a loan. You're not in any trouble, are you? No, not at all. It's just that I have some urgent business in Tokyo. Hello, Michiyo! - Hello there. - Nice to see you the other day. - Michiyo's off to Tokyo. - Oh? When? Tonight. I was thinking of catching the night train. You could go back together. Eh? Well, I was thinking of returning to Tokyo today or tomorrow. - Go and check the train times for me. - OK. Let me buy the tickets. Are you happy? Why do you ask that? I'm just worried about you. Why aren't you married yet, Kazuo? All the girls that I meet seem mean-spirited. Are you really leaving tonight? I'm not sure. Still the same old Michiyo. - I'll go tomorrow morning. - Really? Can you come out? No way. I'm the only one here. Who are the flowers for? You! Who else do you think they're for? Really? Thank you very much. Satoko, what do you think about me? Oh, these roses have such big thorns! Are you making fun of me? Me? What's so funny? - Welcome home. - Evening. Satoko, just listen to what I have to say, will you? When you first saw me, you probably didn't think much of me I'm not educated and I've no money. But if you could like a man like me, then I know I could improve. Satoko! See you again. What is it? Satoko, why did you really come to Osaka? What are you doing with Yoshitaro? Nothing at all. He's a strange one, always buying me things I didn't ask for. Buying you things? And you said nothing and accepted them? Don't you think it's strange when a boy with no job spends what little money he has on a girl? You've had your tour of Osaka. Now how about going back to Tokyo? - You want me out of here. - I'm not forcing you. - I just got back. - Welcome home. You're up late. Where's Michiyo? - You know... - Eh? ...I've decided to go back to Tokyo and get married. That's good. To be honest, I'd love to marry someone like you, Hatsu. But you're too old for me. Cheeky! I'll go back home tomorrow morning with Michiyo. - With Michiyo? - Yes. - She's going to accompany you? - That's right. Welcome home. So, you're taking Satoko home? Yes. And what will you do about money? I've borrowed some. I think we should sit down and talk... Are you really going? Yes. How many days will you be away? Well... - Are you angry about something? - No. Why should I be? Why are you taking such a big suitcase? I don't have anything smaller. But you'll be back soon, won't you? Well, I'm going to Tokyo because I need some time to think things over I'm just tired of it all. I thought Hatsu would've at least come to see us both off. It's during office hours. He's busy. Even so, he has no idea how to treat a lady! But we discussed the whole matter I didn't promise you anything I know that, but Marugaki is relying on your cooperation. It's a sure thing, you'll make an absolute fortune. I just don't think it's for me, that's all. Don't give me that. Anyway, just have a read through this - I'm declining your offer. - Really? Hey there! - You managed to get a seat! - Yes. See you. - Who was that? - A distant relative. Of yours? Wow, he's so good-looking. And he's from Osaka? What a coincidence! Thank you. I hope Mrs Taniguchi takes care of it like I asked her... Of what? My cat. We bumped into each other while waiting for the bathroom I asked him to come over and join us. What do you mean, "just a distant relative"? He's your cousin. Are you getting off at Shinagawa or Tokyo Station? Shinagawa is better for us. From there, you can drop me home by taxi. Satoko! What a lovely necktie! I really like it. Hatsu would really suit one like that. Makeshift houses, built after the bombing raids... ...reflect the evening light. In one such house, lives my mother with my sister and her husband. All I want is to throw myself into my mother's arms... ...and sleep like a child. What's up with my sister? All she does is sleep. You're all the same! Maybe it's in your blood. You're terrible! She must be so tired. Looking after a husband takes it out of you! Michiyo. Michiyo! - It's time to eat. - Already? "Already"? It's supper time. You've slept all day. Really? Young people nowadays are so thoughtless. They just cause worry for their parents. We're not all like that Satoko. These croquettes are good I've been practising my cooking. Know what, though? She only knows one recipe: croquettes, curried rice and miso soup! You're terrible! - Help yourself, sis. - Get stuck in! You're so worried about Hatsu you've lost your appetite, haven't you? The rice is delicious. It's been ages since I tasted such delicious rice. You didn't come all the way to Tokyo just to eat rice! Well, you've got three days' rest before you have to go back. KAWASAKI EMPLOYMENT AGENCY Is that you, Michiyo? - It's been so long. - How are you? You've really grown. In two months my welfare will be cut I keep hoping that I'll find something, but... I can't sleep at night with the worry. And your husband's still...? I used to listen to the radio reports... ...but I know he won't be coming home. Anyway, now I've got rid of the radio, I feel better! But you're managing? I'm doing the best I can. But a woman on her own can't do much. I don't have much hope for the future. It's bleak... - Sometimes it's hard to carry on. - Times are hard. Forgive me, harping on about my misery. You're a happy wife! - They're a married couple. - How can you tell? Look at them, they walk the same way. - Do you want me to do your laundry? - Thanks, but I'm fine. Why did your wife go to Tokyo? - She went to see her mother. - Oh, I see. That's all right, then. You have a visitor. - If you need me, call anytime. - Many thanks. - Come in. - Good day. - Michiyo sent me a letter. - Oh, did she? - "Look in on him," she said. - Eh? Oh... Come on in. - Are you sure I'm not bothering you? - Not at all. Please... Please... - I brought a little something for you. - Thank you. I bet you get a letter from her every day. Not a single one. I don't write, either. Oh? Is that how it is between you? Seems that way! It soon gets messy without the wife around! Please don't go to any great trouble on my behalf. I cooked this for you. Oh...thank you. You could probably do with some help. If you need laundry doing, just tell me. - My maid has time on her hands. - Oh, thank you very much. Oh? You have a visitor? - Yes. - I'll leave you to it, then. - What is it? - Just surprised to hear a woman's voice. She lives across the way. You seem to have plenty of women calling by to help you. I shall report to Michiyo straight away. Oh...there's no need for that I'm sorry. I can't stand cats. It's like being in a different world. I normally spend my days washing and cleaning... I've been to the pictures only three times in Osaka. - No more sad stories, now. - Forgive me. - When are you returning to Osaka? - I don't know. Kazuo? You will help me to find a job, won't you? You really want to work here? Yes...definitely. That way at least I'll have something to live for. And what about your husband? - Never mind. - "Never mind"? Why do you care about what happens to me? I need a drink. Mother wants me to return, but I just can't bring myself to go home. I can't go back to that life of monotony again. You will help me to find a job, won't you? All right. - One more drink? - I've had plenty I bet my face is red. I feel so relaxed. Remember I once went to Hakone with you and my mother? The Tani River was full of those red crabs. Remember? Let's go there after. No! Why not? I'm still a married woman. Unhappily married... Kazuo, do you think I've been unhappy all these years? I can't bear to see you that way, Michiyo. No... Don't feel pity for me...it's miserable. Let's go home. I'll drop you off. "I realise now that being away from you made me miserable." Look at this room! There are clothes strewn all over the place! I'll do it now. Writing a letter? To your husband? Never mind writing letters, you should go home. It's not good to leave men on their own. There are too many women around these days! What woman would fall for him? Plenty would! You did dive headlong into marriage... ...but I did think Hatsu was a good choice. He's quiet and reliable. I know! Honestly, that Marugaki disgusts me. Trying to rope you in like that, Mr Okamoto I'm glad he failed I'm going to sever all ties with him. My bar will become financially independent. But I suppose when it comes down to it, a woman is weak. No matter how determined I am, I still need a man to rely on I've got to go. Let's crack this open, shall we? A little suffering when you're young makes you a man I suffered a lot as a servant when I was young. But now I run my own firm - Takenaka Brokerage! He's no good, that young Marugaki. He thinks he can make easy money. His company went bankrupt. You refused to be taken in by his offer and saved your company. Well done! I thought it all looked far too complicated. "Complicated"? Lucky for us! Stock prices go up and down so quickly nowadays. You always maintain your composure in business dealings - that's an advantage. What's Michiyo doing in Tokyo, leaving you all alone? You must miss her. In the early days, my wife, too, used to run off to her parents... ...whenever we had a quarrel. - She never gave in easily! - That was long ago. By the way... ...I think it's about time you moved to a better company like mine? The pay will be slightly better I'd like to talk it over with Michiyo... Do you always ask Michiyo's opinion first? Have a refill. There's a storm brewing. They said on the radio to expect a typhoon to hit western Japan tonight. Really? - Have you seen Mitsuko? - She's at the bathhouse. She's taking her time! He always misses her - I can hear you! - Can you? I'm trying to tell Michiyo. What? Well, Michiyo... ...if I were Hatsu's mother... ...I'd say to him, "Divorce her!" She might've said it already! - I'm back! What a storm! - You're late. The baby next door is so cute. - Hey, Mitsuko? - Yes? - What is it? - Can you calculate this for me? Ready? Add up: 250, 860... ...320, 1073... - Sorry. Can we start again? - Pay attention. Did you mail that letter to Osaka? Didn't you just write one? Well, he hasn't written to me. Even so... I'm sure he'll write if anything happens. You never fail to amaze me! ...185 and 230. What's the total? 8,440 yen. Yes? Who is it? It's me. - Evening. - Come in. What a storm! Won't your mother and father be worried? - I don't care. - But, Satoko... They'll be fine. Never mind them - I can stay here tonight. - What a girl! Shinzo, she wants to stay here tonight. Her film finished late. But isn't your home in Setagaya closer to the cinema than here? Father got mad at me because of Yoshitaro's letter from Osaka. Father got upset when he saw that the letter was from a man. Naturally I got really mad at him. So, you lost your temper just so you could shock everyone? That's not the reason why I lost my temper. Well, you're just making a nuisance of yourself. - Are you saying I can't stay here? - Satoko! I never said that. What I dislike is people who always act according to their emotions. What do you mean by that? Satoko, watch your tone of voice, you're being rude. Shinzo's the one being rude! I came here because I was so lonely and helpless. - We let you come in, didn't we? - Right, I'm going home! Shinzo, please. Don't be so abrupt with her. I was trying to be kind to her. If I was rude, I apologise. Forgive him. He can be brusque sometimes I know it's small, but the three of us can sleep here. Get the futons I'll telephone her parents. The phone's next door, isn't it? - It's OK, I'll phone them later. - I'll get the beds I'm sure you two can get your own futons ready! My mother shouldn't have to do them for you! Mother and Mitsuko have been working all day! You can get your own futons ready! Satoko! Are you going to read? You should get some sleep. Good news, isn't it? No storm damage in Osaka. That Shinzo is intolerable I'm not coming here again! Guess what? I was with Kazuo yesterday. With Kazuo? I got his phone number on the train I was upset, so I called him at his bank. We had tea in the Ginza, and I suddenly wanted to go to the seaside. He's such a gentleman, isn't he? He always says yes to whatever I want to do. Always with a smile! The only time he said no was when I wanted to go for a swim I've fallen in love with him. He's a little old for me, but he gladly spends money on me. I think I'd like to marry him. You're not jealous, are you, Michiyo? Why? Maybe your husband would be happy if I married Kazuo. - Oh! - Hello. Sorry to put you to so much trouble. - Is my brother-in-law in? - Yes, he's got no classes today I was so worried about you before you called me I'm sorry. - Go and say hello to your father. - I will. She's beyond my control. I realise that now I've tried my best to take care of her, but it's hard being only her step-mother. - Satoko knows what you do for her. - I doubt it. - Have you had any letters from Hatsu? - No I don't write to him, either. Is that so? Well, I guess that's just the way some couples are. Are you still angry with me, Father? I get scared when you're angry. Why are you so out of control, Satoko? I can't stand this kind of behaviour. You're beyond my control. Don't say that. It really upsets me. You know... ...you gave your mother and me such pleasure when you were growing up. Just consider how your parents feel for once. We have absolutely no idea what your intentions are I just can't understand you. Don't bother doing that, Michiyo I have nothing else to do. I'm just killing time. Look. They're still warm. Shinzo is very good-hearted and understanding... ...so your mother is happy I'm sure it's been difficult having you back at home... ...but if it weren't for Shinzo, you'd have been sent back home. I know. I think it'd be better if you went back home to Osaka. Yes... I'm home. Hey, sis...you've a visitor. He's been waiting for you. Sis! Let her alone. She'll meet him when she's ready. Is she all right? Don't worry about her. You know how she is. Hey! What's wrong? - When did you get here? - This morning. - Why? - Business meetings here and there. A business trip? Really? - Where were you off to? - Nowhere... I'm so thirsty. - Do you want a beer? - I've no money on me I have some. "MI YOSHI" SNACKS AND DRINKS It tastes bitter. Tastes good. Your shirt's filthy. - Did you bring a clean one? - Yeah. - How's my cat? - I left her with Mrs Taniguchi. - Apparently her son got a job. - Oh... Did you think I'd return home soon? Yeah. That's why I didn't see any point in writing. My business trip finishes tomorrow. Will you come home with me? I guess so... I wrote you a letter... ...but I didn't mail it. Why not? Since I've been in Tokyo, I've frittered away 2,500 yen! Your Uncle Takenaka has suggested I change companies. The pay will be better... Anyway, I said I'd discuss it with you first. It's for you to decide, not me. Listen, I know things haven't been easy for you I'm fine... Shall we get going? Drink mine, too I'm starving. Oh, sorry! Darling... ...I've thrown the letter away. You know what I wrote? I'm tired. I look across at my husband, here at my side... ...his eyes closed, sleeping peacefully... ...tired from the daily drudgery of work. Each new day, he continues to struggle to make a life for us. To share one's life with such a man, to be at his side... ...to seek happiness in a life together... ...maybe that is where my real happiness lies. Happiness... a woman's happiness... Maybe that is where a woman truly finds happiness
