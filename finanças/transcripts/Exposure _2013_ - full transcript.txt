You know I was pretty once, before they killed me. I was on this photo shoot for Exposure models, and I never went home. They were tied up with this makeup company, making some kind of rejuvenation cream. They needed stem cells. Models were the source. Yes, sir. I was killed so that other women can be beautiful forever ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. Nick, is that you? What are you doing? Hey, I'm Nikki, and that's Blain. We love each other. We're just two kids trying to figure out our dreams. I don't know how things got this messy, but, this is where we started. ? Going down to the city ? To meet Ann and Marie ? It's bad luck I keep getting ? Always comes in threes ? All the things she said ? Doesn't make no sense to me ? I cannot concentrate ? On electricity ? She's such a pretty girl ? She's gonna change the world ? Even if it's just for me ? Even if I only see ? Emma Louise ? Someone else ? When she's with me ? It's all I need ? My luck is changing ? I really believe ? That all the things she says ? Doesn't make much sense to me ? I cannot concentrate ? On electricity ? She's such a pretty girl ? She's gonna change the world ? Even if it's just for me ? Even if I only see ? Emma Louise ? Hey, how's it goin' buddy? Come here for a minute. Major dick action, listen. We got some girl ended up dead. I don't know what happened, but I do know that the father is very upset and he's asking questions, so I need you to do me a favor. Go down there, act like you're Seth Black and try and make him happy, whatever it takes, just don't rub him out, you got it? You got it, no problem. Thanks. Yes, I did it. Is it real? Oh, I can assure you it's real. Vernon Lapp got the biomolecular stock and the organic compound to stabilize. Now, we can clone the genetic code for results. So what will you call the product? Le Ponce. You mean as in the Fountain of Youth? The very one, Benson. It's time to celebrate. To living the dream. To the dream. Tell me, when will you begin trials? Benson, we don't need trials. We've already tested some of the pre-stabilized compound on some individuals. There's been no negative results, and besides, the FDA doesn't monitor health and beauty. No one's watching us. Aaron, you have to be careful. You can't have exposures to possible lawsuits, especially if something goes wrong. Benson, that's why I keep you around. To keep any potential liabilities away from us. Benson, with the Exposure name attached to this product world-wide, women around the world are gonna be lining up outside our door. Wow. We're gonna part of this big dream Aaron. Benson, Le Ponce is gonna be on the face of every woman around the world. This is my billion dollar baby, Benson. Now, get it done. I will. When I make it big as a model, we'll stay... we'll stay someplace real nice. Yeah, I hope so. At least lemme see if I can catch the game. We could put some flowers in here. You gotta be kidding me. A developing story. This local woman has vanished. Hunting for 19 year old... One girl who disappeared from a local bar. Friends say she was approached in a mall by a couple trying to convince her to be a model. You know this is a very, very new product. Since her disappearance, dozens of other girls in the area told authorities they were also approached by a couple with a similar story. It's one of the best products I can ever come out with. This is bigger, bigger than the Superbowl. Let me ask you a question. What would you prefer? Do you prefer plastic surgery? Do you prefer getting a facelift? Someone cutting into your skin with a scalpel? Use my cream. Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. Aaron. Yes, your special delivery just arrived. Oh. I'm so excited to be the first one who is going to try the new cream, Le Ponce. Of course. Yes. I will call you there. Yes. Bye. Oh my gosh. I can't wait. Le Ponce. Just what I needed. Let's see. You have to work. Yes, yes. Bitches, wait. My life is about to change forever. here at the owner of Exposure Model Agency and Ocean Magazine's house, Mr. Aaron Levine to find out about his new campaign. Now, Mr. Levine, in addition to the work that you do at Exposure and the business with Ocean Magazine, can you tell us what type of model will be gracing the cover of this year's Tenth Anniversary Edition? Basically, what she'll be promoting. Can you give us a hint? As always, we want to portray health and vitality. Beauty for everyone. I get that. Models are malnourished and almost dead looking, but wasn't Exposure's last campaign the morgue look? Exactly. I'm glad you asked me that. We never wanna portray mortality. It's all about staying young, looking good, living the good life. I don't care what you say. I paid him 10 grand. He told me he knew where she was. You know these things can get a little tricky, right? What the hell do you mean it wasn't even him? Deliver to me my daughter. I'll deliver your daughter. Don't you worry about it. I'll deliver your daughter. And he told me his name was Seth. Look, I don't care. No, you listen to me. You should have killed me, too. What? Look, I'll walk right into that damn agency with my .44 and I'll shove it right up his ass. Yeah! Captain Alejandro. Decided we're going to the Bahamas this morning. Aye, aye, Mr. Levine. Ah, excuse me. Yes. I understand. Got not problem. Okay. We got it. Listen, nobody cares what the testing problems are with the raw stock or the biomolecular compounds. Nobody cares what happens at sea. All they care about is did we bring the ship home? Look, we have everything riding on the launch of Le Ponce. If there's no stabilization, we have no exit strategy. Do you understand? Okay, then. Levine, later. Mr. Black? There's a Mr. Joe Blasco on line two. Sal! Salvatore! Did you get the stuff ready for next week by any chance? Salvatore! Hey! Did you happen to get the storage ready for next week's Kill Bill shoot? Busy. You're in the middle of a shoot? Why don't you take five? Hey, you look fabulous, okay? Hey, looking good. Very nice, very nice. We're tight, hey, let me ask you a question. Did you happen to get the Kill Bill shoot stuff ready... No, no. I don't have it ready. Well, you have the swords, right? Okay, what about reserving Benihana? No, no. No. Yeah, well, why not? Can you give me a good explanation? Because I was at the shoot as well. Oh, the vulture? Yes. Which had nothing to do with this, right? So, this is what happened. As soon as I start letting my top photographer freelance, suddenly, I become a subordinate. Well, maybe it's Exposure that becomes subordinate, is that what we're talking about here? No. I just need to know. Give me an answer, please. I want to hear what you have to say. You know, there was a guy that I went to jail with once, when I was in prison a few years back and every time I would ask him a question he would give me this stupid look and then he would try to answer it with another question, so every time I ask you something and you answer me with a question, I don't know what to do and that's what called, what do we call it? It's called a quagmire. A quagmire. You know what that means? That means it's an ongoing problem that we don't seem to have a solution for. So, I think I have a solution. Come here. Look at this. I'm trying to run a professional corporation here, and I have assets, you understand? In assets, I have arrangements, therefore, we have deadlines to meet. This is what happens when you don't listen to instructions. Now, if you don't like what's going on here, and you want me to stop. Oh, stop, please. Shut up and listen. If you want me to stop, don't say another word. Stomp your foot one time. Yeah. Was that a yes? Now, go clean yourself up because you look disgusting. Just trying to run a clean business. Welcome to Exposure Models. Hi, I'm Nikki Smith. I'm so happy to be here. I'm sure you are. Seth. Fine, then your 11 o'clock is here and you asked me to get you when she arrived. Get her yourself. Oh, that's not the problem, Gloria. That is not why I'm upset. Do you have any idea why I might be upset right now? No. That was easy. I'm upset because our new thing that we've been waiting on is supposed to be this person. This person is supposed to be blonde hair, blue eyes, five foot four, 110 pounds, 36C, 24-32 and very single. Well, she's not alone, so do want to interview her or not? Oh, gee, well, I don't know. What do you think? Give me your expert opinion. I think you should Seth. You do? I do. Well, I'll trust you then, Gloria. You should. Okay, good. Put her in the conference room. Aaron and I will have a look. Hey Seth. Oh, Aaron, how are you? How's it going? Good as always, good. Doin' okay? Always. Alright. Better than okay. I'm doing excellent and you look good. I like this suit. Is that the new model Benson recruited? The one you've been talking about? That's the one. Nikki Smith. She's dazzling. I can see why you wanted to meet her. Spectacular. She's gonna be my top girl. I'm gonna make that girl. I'm gonna turn her into a star. That's great, but Seth? Seth Black. We have 90 days to launch the Le Ponce line. Yeah. We don't have production stills. Nah. This is big money we're talking about. Yes. I want to be living the dream. And you are the dream. You are my dream. Well, you make it happen, Seth, because I'm counting on you. I've got it. You're done. You're gonna make billions. You're gonna own this world. Do you understand? You've got the most powerful cosmetic thing ever in the history of cosmeticals. Don't let me down, dude. I won't let you down. Gloria! Mr. Black will be right with you. Thank you. Sabrina, got that file? It's right here. Thank you. You must be Nikki. Nikki Smith. I am Seth Black. This is my fiance... Nikki Nascar. I like that. It's like Formula One Racing but it puts you in the driver's seat and I like that. This is my fiance, Blain. Okay, let's see what you've got here. In our file we have you listed as single. However, apparently, you don't look very single to me. The reason why we needed a single woman for this job, honey, is because we're looking for somebody that can just kind of grab life by the balls. We are running a massive campaign, and we are looking for somebody that can literally, no strings attached, at the drop of a dime, pick up and leave and go wherever we need anywhere around the world. Now, that is a very big commitment. Now, no disrespect in any way to you, bro, because I'm tellin' you, I think this girl may have exactly what we need. She may have it, but I just can't give it to her without that commitment. It's a big commitment and not everybody can do it. You have to be able to drop everything. No strings attached. We need a model who can grab the world by the balls and own it. Own every moment and I can't have anybody that's afraid of leaving their attachments. My point is, I'm here to find the right model, the right face, the right look for the most important campaign that we've ever taken on and I believe that you may have what it takes. Well, if it's alright with you, Blain, I would like to take Nikki in the other room, introduce her to the photographer, put her through the test shoot and we'll see how she does. Can we do that? Yes, we can do it. Nikki, right this way. Keep your hands to yourself. That's so sweet. Haven't been around much lately. I miss you being here. Ah, thank you. As you know, though, our recent project has me diversifying the company, but, how are things coming on your end, Gloria? Everything's on track. Business is great, although the heat's on with the recent news coverage of the missing models. Gloria. Don't worry about the assets of Exposure. I'm making sure anything we previously set up is not gonna be impacted by this. Gloria, I know you. You'll sleep better at night not knowing the particulars. ? Blue skies ? Smilin' at me ? Nothing but blue skies ? Do I see She is stunning, isn't she? ? When you feel ? You're falling behind ? Everything is twisted in your mind ? You can hear the calling of the night ? Just be thankful ? For time to live ? Again Come on. I've got ya. Mr. Levine is here. Open the door. How's the solution coming? Well, I can't seem to get the cells to stabilize. The tissue doesn't seem to want to regenerate. It will work, won't it? Oh, when the biomolecular structure and the solution come together at a hundred degrees Celsius, the tissue will become alive and the alive tissue will stabilize and will make the solution and the solution will self-replicate. Excellent, Bern. But now I need you to go back to work. I need results, Bern. I've gone to the far ends of the earth to come up with the organic stock to make this cream. This is my destiny. This is my billion dollar idea, Bern. It's my billion dollar baby. Make it happen. I will. So this it. This is the complete underbelly of Exposure fine art. This is where it all lives and this right here, this display is literally what put Exposure models on the map. It gave us our street cred. It's the only thing that made it all happen. My most brilliant display ever. It's called the Marionette Post-Mortem Look. What do you think? She looks so real. Isn't it amazing? How did you do that? Well, it's a process. It's a brand new process. Never been used before. I mean, it's very complicated, but essentially, we spliced and mutated some genetic cells fusing it with silicone and animated body parts. Animatronics, but with cyber skin. She's saying so much and she's not even... You know what? I don't understand what she's saying. Well, it's all about what she's not saying that's important. Don't speak. Shhh. Quiet. What do you think? She looks so defeated. You get it. You may be an art connoisseur. It just takes a little time to appreciate the finer things in life. Speaking of the finer things in life, you, Miss Nikki Nascar, are ready for your big moment. It's time to make you a star. But listen, I run this frickin' town, okay? Next time I ask you a question, you answer my frickin' question or you gonna have so many problems that you wish you were back in Cuba with Castro. Yeah, whatever, take it easy. You got it? Yeah, yeah, let go. Yeah. Hey, it's me, George. Hey, there's a detective looking for Seth Black at the store. You told me if anybody comes by to let you know. Got a nice little thing for Mr. Detective Orlando, understand? No, he's outside in the front waiting for me to come back. You keep him there, 'cause if you don't, you're gonna be next, you understand? George. George, George, George, George. Come on and open the door. I could've sworn that that prick it's always 1:30 for me. Always 1:30 for me. How are ya, honey? Okay, look at this. This is my new model. You like her? Her name is Excellent. All the time.

Very, very good place for this. You've got great bottle holders. Put it on your tab? Put it on my tab. Thanks, George. Alright buddy. Love you like a brother from another mother. ? I read the book ? But didn't get the joke ? 'cause I watched the sun drip from the sky ? Like stars on a carpet ride and ? You're in my head ? A half-beat trip ? Sitting on an ocean made of fire ? Like dogs in the rain ? Oh, oh ? Oh, oh ? In the nighttime ? In the night ? In the nighttime Yes, Aaron. I am so happy tonight. Yah. The cream works so well. Oh, well, let's talk about it. I know that said Rhonda A. use it but I always want it. Wait until you see me after I use the cream. You won't be able to resist me anymore. Unbelievable! Oh, well. and I will give you what you want. Is that a yes or no? Because it's not. I'm gonna go out tonight and I will give what you want to someone else. What? Is that a yes? Well, okay. Just get away. Hey Aaron. What's up? How are you? Good as always. Nice to see you. Sit down, please. We gotta talk about her. I don't know what she's up to, but I saw her going through my stuff today. Thank you. It's definitely a problem, that's all I know. I don't know what the problem is... Seth, how many times have I told you don't mess with the product? You understand? You mess with the product one more time, I'm gonna send you on assignment, you get that? You're cute. So, Aaron, it's an honor to meet you. They tell me that you're the publisher of Ocean Magazine? I am. Wow, that's incredible. Such a successful man. Well, we'd love to stay longer. We really can't 'cause we kinda got to get going... What's the hurry? I'm just now gettin' to meet you two.

You can't take it. You can't. You better take care of this. Now. Nikki. What is taking so long? Through the darkness, we sometimes get light, and in the light, things start to change. And that's where this story takes a whole new turn. Payback's a bitch and so am I. Oh, and the princess arrives. So nice of you to join us. Well, let's have a drink. Nikki Nascar. Hey!
