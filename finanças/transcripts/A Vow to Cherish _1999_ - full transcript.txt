OH, I HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING ANYTHING. OH, EXCUSE ME. PHIL, JULIA SINCLAIR, MY BROTHER, PHIL. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. I WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. I WONDERED IF YOU WERE FREE FOR LUNCH. SURE. AND YOU'RE WITH. . . JULIA'S AH, JUST A FRIEND. OH. . .OH, JUST A FRIEND. HAVE A NICE LUNCH. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU. (John) I CAN'T SAY I BLAME HIM. IF IT WAS ANYONE BUT FAMILY, I'D A GOTTEN THE BOOT A LONG TIME AGO. (Julia) I'M SO SORRY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? (John) I DON'T KNOW. SO MUCH OF WHAT I DID WAS FOR ELLEN AND OUR FUTURE. YOUR FUTURE ISN'T OVER. WOULD ELLEN WANT YOU TO GIVE UP YOUR LIFE FOR HER? SHE LOVED YOU. I KNOW WHAT A WOMAN WANTS FOR THE MAN SHE LOVES, SHE WANTS YOU TO GO ON AND BE EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL. . . FOR YOURSELF AND KYLE AND TERI. YOU'RE SUCH A GIVING MAN.

HER NAME IS JULIA SINCLAIR. SHE'S BECOME A. . . A DEAR FRIEND. SHE'S AMAZING. SHE LISTENS ENDLESSLY TO MY WHINING. I'M JUST SO LONELY, ALEXANDER.

I LOVE ELLEN. . . BUT I JUST. . . SOMETIMES I CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT OF HOLDING HER HAND AND JUST BEING SO COMPLETELY ALONE. LONELINESS CAN BE A TERRIBLE THING. I KNOW-- I'M AN EXPERT. THERE WAS A TIME I THOUGHT I HAD A LONELINESS PROBLEM, SAME AS YOU'RE FEELING NOW. I KNOW THE SIGNS. BUT, JOHN, YOU HAVEN'T GOT A LONELINESS PROBLEM, I THINK THE ISSUE FOR YOU IS TRUST. ARE YOU FREE TOMORROW NIGHT? I SUPPOSE SO. . .WHY? YOU'LL HAVE TO TRUST ME ON THIS. ALL RIGHT? (Billy Graham) I REMEMBER THAT NIGHT IN TEMPLE TERRACE. GOD WAS SPEAKING TO MY HEART-- I KNEW THAT. AND I REMEMBER GETTING ON MY KNEES ON THE 18TH HOLE OF THE GOLF COURSE AND I SAID, "OH, GOD. . .I GIVE IN. "I NEVER WANTED TO BE A PREACHER. "I NEVER WANTED TO BE ANYTHING IN THE CHURCH. "I DIDN'T LIKE THE CHURCH, BUT I'LL BE WHAT YOU WANT ME TO BE "AND I'LL DO WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO." AND THAT CALL HAS NEVER LEFT AND GOD HAS SAID, "I WANT YOU TO CONTINUE AS LONG AS I GIVE YOU THE STRENGTH." THE VOICE WAS SO DISTINCT THAT I COULDN'T MISUNDERSTAND THAT CALL. AND EVERY CHRISTIAN IS CALLED TO MINISTRY. DID YOU KNOW THAT? THE WORD MINISTRY MEANS SERVANT, SERVICE. WITH A CALL TO DO SOMETHING FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE LESS FORTUNATE THAN WE ARE. JESUS TOOK ON HIMSELF THE FORM OF A SERVANT, THE BIBLE SAYS. HE SAID, "I DID NOT COME TO BE SERVED, BUT TO SERVE." IN MARK 10. IT'S TOUGH TO DO THE WILL OF GOD. (Billy Graham) WE HAVE THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE WORLD. THE HIGHEST STANDARD THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN. AND YET AS A NATION WE'RE IN DANGER OF LEAVING GOD OUT OF OUR LIVES. (John) OH, PLEASE, GOD, FORGIVE ME-- FORGIVE ME FOR TRYING TO DO ALL THIS ON MY OWN. I NEED YOU LORD. . . NOW MORE THAN EVER. (Billy Graham) THE DEVIL WILL ALWAYS HAVE A SHIP READY WHEN A MAN WANTS TO SAIL AWAY FROM GOD. YOU SEE GOD GAVE HIS SON, JESUS CHRIST, TO DIE ON THAT CROSS FOR YOU. THAT'S THE REASON HE WAS THERE. . . (Alexander) JOHN?. . . ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH! I'VE GOT TO GO HOME, ALEXANDER. I HAVE SOME THINGS I NEED TO DO. SURE. . . LET'S GO!

[engine purrs] I SEE THE LAUNDRY TRUCK HAS ARRIVED. HI, UNCLE PHIL. HOW'S IT GOING? OKAY. IS YOUR DAD HERE? NO. WHY, WHAT'S WRONG? NOTHIN'. ACTUALLY, PLENTY. WHY? YOUR DAD TURNED OVER THE CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE COMPANY TO ME. REALLY? YEAH, REALLY. IT'S BEEN A DISASTER. I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED. YEAH, HE JUST DUMPED EVERYTHING ON ME AND SPLIT. THE WHOLE OFFICE STAFF IS NERVOUS, SOME OF THEM HAVE QUIT. I'M AFRAID IF I TELL THE CLIENTS I'M GOING TO LOSE A LOT MORE THAN JUST EMPLOYEES. HE KNOWS HOW VALUABLE HE IS TO THIS COMPANY, HE CAN'T JUST DO THIS. LOOK, DAD'S HAS BEEN UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE LATELY WITH MOM AND EVERYTHING. THERE'S A LOT OF PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE AND PLACES THAT CAN DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF TAKING CARE OF YOUR MOM THAN YOUR DAD HAS. (firmly) YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN HIM WITH HER. ARE THEY GOING TO PUT 1 1/2 TEASPOONS OF HONEY IN HER TEA, JUST THE WAY SHE LIKES IT? ARE THEY GOING TO READ TO HER OUT OF THE BIBLE AND BRUSH HER HAIR EVERY NIGHT?

WELL, I HEARD JOHN SPILLING HIS GUTS, I DIDN'T THINK I SHOULD INTERRUPT. MAN, WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HIM? HE LET GO OF THE BUSINESS, HE LET GO OF JULIA, HE LET GO OF ELLEN. HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT. I MEAN, HOW DO YOU GET PEACE BY LETTING GO OF EVERYTHING? I THOUGHT YOU GET PEACE BY HAVING EVERYTHING. WELL, IT'S EASY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND, BUT NOT SO EASY WHEN YOU TRY AND DO IT. YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT MATTERS IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT TAKES SOMEONE BIGGER THAN OURSELVES TO HELP US FIND TRUE PEACE. WE WEREN'T DESIGNED TO DO IT ALONE. SO HOW DOES JOHN DO IT? HE FINALLY RECOGNIZED THAT GOD WAS FULLY CAPABLE OF HANDLING ANYTHING WE GIVE HIM TO HANDLE AND THAT THERE IS NO TRUE PEACE WITHOUT THAT STEP. I THOUGHT GOD HELPS THOSE WHO HELP THEMSELVES. HOW CAN HE IF YOU'RE TOO BUSY HANDLING THINGS YOURSELF? YOU SEE, GOD LOVES US SO MUCH, HE GAVE HIS ONLY SON, JESUS CHRIST, TO DIE IN OUR PLACE. THEN HE RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD TO PROVE THAT HE WAS HIS SON AND TO SHOW US THAT WE TOO COULD HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. IF HE'S WILLING TO DO ALL THAT WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM US, WHY SHOULD HE WANT TO SEE US CARRY OUR OTHER BURDENS? I DON'T KNOW. WELL, HE DOESN'T WANT US TO CARRY THEM. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE DON'T HAVE TO. HE'S MORE THAN CAPABLE OF MANAGING OUR LIVES IF WE JUST LET HIM. BUT WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE NEED HIM AND THEN LEARN TO TRUST HIM, TO BELIEVE IN HIM-- LET HIM TAKE CONTROL. INVITE HIM TO BE THE LORD OF YOUR LIFE. SO, IS THAT WHAT JOHN DID? UH-HM. IS THAT HOW HE GOT THAT PEACE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT? THAT'S HOW. YOU WANT SOME OF THAT? SOUNDS LIKE TOO GOOD OF A DEAL. IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT THE DEAL. BUT YOU KNOW-- YOU'RE RIGHT! IT IS A GOOD DEAL.
