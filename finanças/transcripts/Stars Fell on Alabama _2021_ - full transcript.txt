Hollywood stars fell in Alabama. Dress up as your favorite movie star and have the time of your life." Hmm. Oh, a prize is voted for uh, best couple's costume. You gotta be kidding me. You know what? Nobody reads these things anyways. There weren't even that many people in my graduating class! Oh, come on! It's not a big deal. It is not a big deal. This is silly, because you can just um, not go. You can just not go. Yeah. Just... you know, just say it's a... A uh, work emergency. Perfect. Yeah. I mean sure you know, some of my friends will be bummed, but you know, I haven't seen... I haven't seen you know, most of these guys in 15 years anyways. I mean look, it's not like the whole town cares whether I go to some silly high school reunion. I'm here with Mayor Winton Lott, the person who brought palm trees to Main Street. He has some big news to share with us about the Willow Valley High School's 15-year reunion. Well, after learnin' our very own Bryce Dixon is comin' home from Hollywood with a movie star, I was thrilled. There's no better way to involve the town than with a Main Street contest. So we're inviting folks to decorate their storefront windows as their favorite Hollywood movie. What's the prize? - $5,000. - Wow! Yep, and who knows? Bryce Dixon might even put you in a movie. Hey, mom. What? It is... it's still early enough, there's time, she could still catch the flight. Uh, I'll just call her. I mean what's the harm in asking? I'll just call her and... and ask. No, no, what are you doing? You... Come on, look. You're not... you're not in high school, okay? You... you're not asking a girl to prom. You're calling a client, askin' a favor. Callin' a client, askin' a favor. Come on. Hello, Bryce. Uh, hey, Madison. Uh, morning. Sorry, did I... did I wake you? Studio call yet? Uh, no. No, not yet, we're still waiting, but uh, why are we whispering? I'm in my yoga boxing class. Is that a thing? It's a thing. Uh, why are you calling? Uh, well, I um, I got you a... a... a... a gig, a role, another... another role. Um, you know, su... super easy. Uh, just a couple of days max. You know, I like more details about my roles. More time to think it over. Yeah, yeah, of course, of course, I know, but unfortunately with this one, we just don't have enough time. but um, don't worry about it. Just you know, a couple of days uh, you know, some appearances, a... a dance, all the barbecue you want. Oh, what kinda role is this? Well, it is uh, actually more like a reunion. What? Look, it is uh, it is just something to distract you while we wait for the big news. Alright? Strictly work related, trust me. I trust you. You're my agent. Two years ago, I was waiting tables I didn't know how I was gonna pay rent. Mmhmm, and soon you will be shopping for a house in Hollywood. Yeah, all thanks to you. Okay, well, the gig is out of town, so pack a bag and uh, I will send a car to pick you up and take you to LAX in 30 minutes. Are you serious? You never said it was out of town. I just did. Huh, alright. - I'll see you at the airport. - I can't. I gotta take a shower, I gotta get food packed, get a manicure. Uh, Madison, still there? Bryce, I... I'm sorry. Okay. Um, yeah, yeah. Uh, well, I... I am sure that they will forgive me. Bryce? Did you hang up on me? Look, uh... Madison, I... I wouldn't be asking if I didn't really need this favor. Please. You know what? Fine. I need to get out town anyway. Okay, okay. Uh, great, I will be sending an Uber your way in 30 minutes. I need an hour. And can you please tell me where we're going? Alabama. Do I need to bring my passport? You and Madison should be landing in Alabama by now. I went ahead and confirmed all of your reservations for the reunion and as always, I went with the best available option. Have fun. Okay, we are lookin' for... it's D-12. - Okay. - D-12. Really? This is the best available. Yes. Yes, it is. Come on. I'm callin' her "Big Red". Real tight. Do you like football? Oh, that's part of the Holy Trinity down here. Yep, it is uh, God, country, and football, and uh, not necessarily in that order. Alright, drive will be about an hour. Okay, I'm now up to speed on classic Alabama music and your reunion Facebook page. I need to know all about your high school friends. Mark and Ellie Rowan married right after high school. Two kids. He works in real estate. Rick and Rachel Kemnade, two kids. Uh, whoa, she is really pretty. And David Brooks. Divorced, serial entrepreneur. Sounds interesting. It's kinda menacing. Can't tell. Huh, he does have kind eyes, though. Yeah, he's uh, he's just an all-around great guy. You know, all of my friends from out here, he's the only one who's made it out to see me in LA. But that was uh, but that was years ago, now. ♪ ...at least, a dozen times ♪ - ♪ And every time I think... ♪ - And uh... I am assuming from the comments, you're Dixie. Yep, Dixie. That's uh, that's what they called me growin' up. Hmm. Well, Dixie, nice to meet you. I'm Madison. Oh, hey. Hey, Sarah. You're alive and well in Alabama? We are indeed. Did the studio call yet? Not yet, but you know, I'd patch that call through ASAP, boss. Sarah is a consummate professional. She is the best at validating. Hey, Madison, you're the best and don't let anyone tell you differently. Alright, thanks, Sarah. Don't laugh, but don't you think Sarah and I could be good friends? You keep things professional with everyone? Guess so, yeah. And if these people here are your friends, why didn't you just tell 'em the truth that we're not dating? You haven't spent too much time in the Deep South, have you? No. Yeah, well, things are a... they're a little different here. When I told some of the people I went to high school with that I was single, they... I don't know, I... you know? It's like I... I could feel their... Pity? Somethin' like that. Do you want that? Do you want a wife, kids, dog, the whole shebang? Sure, yeah. You know, some day with the right person, but right now, I am uh, just a little bit preoccupied getting my clients in hit movies.

Oh, well, I just never seen you as a dancer. No, I'm full of surprises. Hmm, yeah, apparently. So how long have we been dating for? And it needs to be less than a year. Um, I don't know.

But okay, okay, so we've been dating a while, you're taking me to your reunion. Mmhmm. Some people might see a ring in your future. Look, one day, I actually think that I will make a pretty darn good husband, but uh, how about this weekend, just trying to be a perfect gentleman. And I would expect nothing less, but from time to time, to create a believable illusion, you're gonna have to put your arm around me. Well, if that's okay with you, ma'am? Hmm. - And Dixie. - Mmhmm.

When the kids are away, the adults will play. Where are we going? And turn that off, we don't get caught. I am not spraining an ankle. We used to sneak into the school at night and swim in the pool. - Yeah, it was fun. - It still is. You know what? No, just uh, leave it to the expert. Pay attention. The trick is push, hold, lift, partly turn, and... - Huh? - Hey. What would you guys do without me? Go back to the bar. Get inside. Go, go, go, go. Awesome! At least, he wore boxers this time. Wooh! Did they catch us? No, honey, but could you please get your butt in the pool before all the blood rushes from my husband's head. - Wooh! - Ooh! Wooh! What? We're goin' to the gym, starting Monday.

Fine, fine. But only if you give me dirt on Bryce. - Oh. - You mean Dixie? Okay, Dixie was a run-of-the-mill super dork with a little bit of troublemaker mixed in. Mmhmm. Yep, he was the chess club president. Master debater, um... One time, Dixie got us to fill this entire school with crickets. No, poor little guys. - What... - No, it was genius. Yeah, we uh, we actually let 'em in through the air vents very gently. Chirpin' was so loud that we couldn't even hear the teacher, so they had to cancel school for two days. - Mmhmm. - Yeah. Yeah, and he was one of the good guys. Okay, thank you all, so very much, for telling her all that. At least, you didn't tell her I was into magic. Or the drama club. Uh, not that there's anything wrong with actin', I... Mmhmm, yeah. Uh, anyway, this is such great material and everything, but I need blackmail material. Oh! Oh, well, Bryce always got away unscathed while the rest of us took the fall. Hmm, and ex-girlfriends? Oh, we've been on a date or two. Hmm? Technically, about six and a prom, but who's counting? I was his first kiss. Oh, please, tell me that story. Please. Well, Bryce was too scared to make a move, so after three dates, I kissed him. Hmm. His eyes shot wide open and he froze. I meant to do that, though. It was cute! It all ended on account of his little Dixie cup. Funny, what? It was very innocent. And then after graduation, he moved away to California. Yeah, and uh, never looked back. Well, Rachel, I'm so glad that high-school Bryce had fantastic taste. I would have thought he dated Charlotte. Oh. No. You're good. That's rich, that's good. That's pretty good. You, guys. No! Oh, it seems that Bryce has forgotten where he's from. I... Ooh, mama. Stop it. Alright, love birds, I'm sensin' a little tension here. Huh, did somebody say uh... "Little"? Ooh, is that supposed be a joke about me, that's funny. Behave. I wanna see you two kiss and make up. Cheers. Wrong answer, Romeo. Kiss. Oh, pop that tick. Kiss for real. Before David suggests a game of spin the bottle, night, y'all. Get home safe. Bryce, we need to make one stop on the way back to the inn. Well, as requested here it is, the house that I grew up in. I like it. Was it really that bad growin' up here? Uh, no. It just wasn't me. You seem to get along just fine here. Do tire swings and tipsy people go together? Well, usually uh, those two things are quite the recipe for disaster, so... Why don't we go ahead and play it safe? I'll show you the backyard. This is playing it safe? Technically, if we get caught for breaking and entering, we do know the mayor. Oh, come on. What was that? Huh? Uh, I'll check it out. Hmm. In horror movies, this never ends well. - Oh, my God, Bear! - A bear? No, uh, come here, buddy. Oh. So growin' up didn't have a dog, but did have a pet tortoise. Bear Bryant, meet Madison. Hi. Yeah, I named him after the legendary Alabama football coach. Oh, my gosh. Hi. Yeah, and I gave him to uh, David when I went to college. He won't bite you. Man, I spent a lot of time right here growin' up. I can't believe you haven't been back in so long. Well, I didn't have a reason to. You haven't been back to visit your parents? Where are they? Where are yours? Portland. Maine or Oregon? Oregon. Siblings? An older sister. Hmm, it's interesting. You? Only child. Hmm, that's interesting. And your parents? Uh, well, they're d... Oh my God, I am so sorry. I had no idea. Oh, no uh, no, uh, divorced. Yeah, thank God. Um, well, that they're... you know what I mean? Yeah uh, they split about a month after I went to college. It got pretty messy. Dad went to Virginia and mom moved to Florida. Look, Madison, I... I wish that I didn't... I know. Uh. Shall we? Well, that's too bad we can't go inside. David says, "Surprise". David. Hmm. Hmm. Well, it uh, definitely looks a little different. But it still feels like home. No way. Wow. Wow. So, where's your old room? Alright, here it is. I guess nothing's changed. Funny. Not funny. Thanks for bringing me here. Well, uh, I know it's not exactly the uh, Hotel Bel Air, but uh... No, no, no. I meant to your reunion. I'm happy you're here, too. Look, about earlier... No, I'm sorry, I... I... No, no I... When I saw you kiss Charlotte or her kissing you or whatever, it hurt... For no reason. And I know we're just pretending and I know you never date your clients, but... but still... ...being here with you, I like it. I like your friends. I like seein' you with your friends... Am I babbling? A little bit. Huh. I... I meant to do that. Yeah. Wait, we... we shou... shouldn't... No. Rules are meant to be broken. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Oh, sh... David, what are you doing, buddy? I got you coffee and doughnuts. And I reserved a VIP table at the diner for breakfast. Aren't the doughnuts breakfast? Honey, those are just appetizers. Welcome to the South. Road time. I heart him so much. Yeah, he's the best guy I know. You're the best guy I know. You're sweet. Mm, good trouble. I think you might actually need a new agent. Wait, um... I don't know. It's gonna be hard to replace my current one. Since apparently, he never stops working. Mmhmm. Well, you're up off early. Aw, isn't that cute? You've been in Bama one night and you've already got an accent. Awful early, I do declare. Okay, Sarah, just uh, tell me that the deal is done. Not yet, but I did follow up with the studio, but that's not why I'm calling. Just don't shoot the messenger. What? TMZ spotted Madison. and you. I've already called PR and they're handling damage control. Okay, uh, great. Just... Keep me updated. Will now be a bad time to talk to you about my promotion to agent? Perhaps tomorrow. This is my favorite place in town, right here. Sorry, I'm late. Kids might be catchin' a bug, so Ellie's at home takin' care of 'em. Hmm, I hope they get better soon. Right, Bryce? Uh, yeah, uh, real soon. Sorry about that. Alright, fried chicken, fried shrimp, fried catfish, French fries, fried cornbread, fried pickles. Is the water fried, too? What is happening? Come on, Bryce. That was comedy gold! Look at this. Madison Belle caught getting cozy with a mystery man outside a barbecue joint down South. It's fine, Bryce. It's just some photos of me dancing and havin' a good time, which is not a crime. I mean God forbid, someone has fun with their friends, right? Right. Yeah, except they're also leaking more photos. See? Oh, they got my good side! Okay. Look, I just don't want anything to affect the studio's decision, alright? That's all. Here you go, honeys. - Uh... - Thank you. Oh, and can I give you this? Just top the whole thing off with hot sauce and you're good to go. Yeah, to the hospital. Well, I will try anything once. Oh, I got it. Say "thank you", Parker. Thank you, Parker. Thanks, Bryce. No problem. Alright. Thank you. And instead of a tip for me, I have a tip for you. My daughter Kelly would be perfect for your next movie. She's a natural. Honestly, I don't think I've been this full in like... 15 years. Did you just copy me? Oh, Bryce! Oh, Bryce, you finished my script yet? - Um... - I'm not gettin' any younger. Mrs. Miller uh, Agnes, funny seeing you here. Oh, visiting my son. The dentist. Now, when can I expect your comments? Agnes, we will see you at the inn. We are actually headed to a football game and Bryce is playing. - Uh, yep. - Yeah. Uh, bye. Thank you for that. Ah, fun fact. Here is where I had my first date. - Yeah. - Aww. Yeah, Emily Becker, fifth grade, we shared a milkshake and French fries. I thought she was the coolest girl, because she had seen Batman & Robin three times. Who doesn't love Christian Bale? Uh... Actually, it was uh, George Clooney. And Clooney was Batman? Yes. - Yes, he was. - Hi. Hey. A couple of lollies. Yeah. Two of these, cool. Here uh, keep the change. Thanks a lot. - Thank you. - Take care. Red? Blue? Thank you. This place, I mean seriously, the same as it's been. When was the last time you've been here? That's 15... 15 years. Okay. When was your first date? 12th grade. - What? - I was a late bloomer! - 12th grade. - Had a overprotective father. - Okay? - Oh. Gosh. - Lolly? - Thank you. - Now, you feel better. - Hmm. He's never liked anyone I've dated, but I have a feeling he might like my mystery man. ♪ Take off your makeup ♪ Look at that. Oh, I found a hat. - I found a cane. - Ready? - Whoa! - And...

Thank you. Thank you so much. And thank you, you're doin' a great job, honey. I'm honored to be here with you all tonight celebrating a... the uh... A... a... a passage of time. That's right folks, 'cause you are all like a fine, fine wine and I think it's time to get this party uncorked. what do you say? Are you ready to have your minds blown, huh? I'm ready to blow your mind! But before we get into it, I'd just like to uh, invite up on stage someone very dear to me. She is the yin to my yang, the Yoko to my Ono. Would you please help me ring in this reunion for none other than Miss Madison Belle, - everyone! - What is he doing? I said, "Miss Madison Belle". Yeah. She's a little shy, folks. Come on, let's help her out. Madison, Madison, Madison. Madison, Madison, Madison. - Yeah, come on. - Yeah, fine. Madison, Madison, Madison, Madison, Madison. Good on you, Madison. What are you doin'? Good job for bein' a good sport. She's a good sport. Yeah, just go with it, it's gonna be fun. Grab a guitar. Now, most of you would recognize Madison from her TV shows and her movies, but... But she's also a bit of a songbird, too. Now, I have to admit I have heard a few of these Alabama stereotypes. Ooh! Oh, okay, sorry. But what I have found in my short time here has surprised me. I wanna ask you a question, though. If you take away the enchanting Main Street, and historic buildings and clear lakes, do you know what you'd have left? Mississippi! Jokester. No, love.

As your former homecoming queen and head cheerleader, I have the distinct pleasure of announcing the best Main Street movie display. The winner is... Sorry, before you announce the winner of whatever you're doing, there's something that I need to say or rather to ask. Now, let's not kid ourselves, folks. I'm not here for the arts and crafts. I'm here for Miss... for Miss Madison belle. That's right. One more song. One more song. - One more song. - No, no, no, no, no. I don't want Madison to sing another song. I want her here by my side. Now, most of you probably know this from the grocery store rags, but Madison and I, we used to be a bit of a thing. And I think you can all agree we've made some sweet, sweet music for y'all tonight, huh? Hey! I never want that to end. So, Madison... Zane. Would you do me the honor? Madison, wait! That didn't go as planned, did it? Uh, well. Hey, guys, guys, so where did Madison go? Oh, I knew it today is the day. Can't slip out of this one unscathed, Dixie. Tell us the truth. Alright, look, I... I... Wait, I gotta say something first. Good Lord, please don't tell me you were the one puttin' ham on your shoulder all these years. Come on, guys. Ellie and I are separated. A few months now. I thought we could work through it, but we can't. I'm sorry, buddy. You know, I've been through that. Why didn't you tell me? Honestly? I felt like a failure. I mean if I can't make my marriage work, I couldn't be good at anything. Mark, come on. Uh, then I realized that I... I'd given it my all, but in the end, Ellie and I just aren't right for each other. We're gonna keep it civil for the kids. Make sure that they know that their parents love them more than anything... Hey, you are a good man, Mark. All of you are. And uh, well, I think that now I need to go try and be a good man, too. Um, hi. Yeah uh, it's been a pretty interesting evening. And I'm sure that you guys have uh, quite a few questions like... Why did Zane Thomas propose to your girlfriend? Yeah, exactly. Like... like that. Um... ...well, unfortunately the answer to that one is uh, is... is pretty simple. I lied. Yeah, and... and um, I owe all you guys a big apology and... And Madison, too, for draggin' her into this. Look, I... I... I only came out here to impress everyone. I mean I'm livin' the LA dream! Yeah, exactly. You know, but I... I've realized that what's the most important is the people around you. You know, your friends and... and your family. In my whole life, I... I... I've just focused on my career. You know, I wasn't gonna let anything derail my success, you know? Eyes on the prize. But a um, you know, a... a wise friend recently told me that when you meet the right person, your heart will let you know. And there isn't anything that you wouldn't sacrifice for them. And these past few days have taught me that that's exactly how I feel about Madison. So, Madison... Wherever you are um, I just wanted to say... ...I'm honored... that you came down here with me, and I have loved every moment that we've spent together, and I'm sorry to you and uh... ...to everyone. Well, well uh, no uh, not to Zane. You know, g... Growin' up I... I... I just... I dreamt of living in California and I couldn't wait to get out of here. But I really... I really should have paid attention to the lessons that my Alabama family had to teach me. Like to be a good husband, and father, and to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, and just the golden rule, to treat others the way that you want to be treated. Kevin, you're a grown-ass man, alright? Enough with the ham. And by the way, Winton. You really are a good mayor. Great things really are happening here in Willow Valley. I mean that laughter and... and... and... and the loyalty, I... I've seen this weekend... I just realized that that's far more valuable than heck both my Ferraris and frankly anything that money can buy. - Hmm. - He has two Ferraris. This weekend, I... I saw the real true Willow Valley for the first time. And... and look, guys, I just... I just hope that... You know, one day you can forgive me. Dixie, we forgive you. Set the record straight. Are you and Madison dating? Yes. We are. For two days. Well, this has been touchin' and all, but I'm still waitin' to hear who won the Main Street decorating contest? Uh, and the winner is... ...Casablanca! Now, Bryce, kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the last time. You know uh, you really are gonna need to get a new agent now. Yeah, anyone except Larry.
