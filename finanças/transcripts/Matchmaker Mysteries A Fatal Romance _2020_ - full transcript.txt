♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Romance. Thanks, fellas. Oh, and um, remember what I said. Three keys to a great first date. Pick a restaurant with amazing desserts, leave your phone on silent, and most importantly, just be yourself. Thank you so much for coming. Oolong, two tea bags. Honey? Oh, I'm sorry. Um, I will go get some. Don't bother, I'll do it myself. Oh, uh, sorry everyone, Miss Penn's autograph session has ended. No, but she is one of the featured guests in the Romance Writer's Roundtable in Hall H so we hope to see you there. We'll see you there. Yeah. Ok. Bring this, will you? Oh, yeah. So sorry. I know. Thanks, guys! Miss Dove. Welcome to our little convention. I can't thank you enough for agreeing to participate. We're all such big fans of the Matchmaker here at Written in the Stars. I am flattered you thought of me. Well, who better to moderate a romance writer's panel than Philadelphia's foremost authority on love? Beatrice. I'd like you to meet- Angie Dove. Oh, you watch my show? I recognized you from the standee. - Ah. - This is my assistant, Margaret. I read your blog post last month about finding love in the digital age. It was wonderful. Margaret's a bit of a hopeless romantic. Well, hopeful. Uh, do I have time to freshen up a bit before the panel starts? 30 minutes? Great. And can you please have someone bring those gifts up to my room? 721. Of course. That's quite a haul. Well, Bea has a very passionate fan base. That's certainly one way to describe them. My mother happens to be among your most devoted. She is first in line the day your books come out. If it's not too much trouble I would love to get an autograph. It's her birthday next week. Of course. First edition. Was that hard to find? Oh, um, funny story, actually. I tried a few bookstores, a few dealers, a yard sale I tried on a hunch. No book, of course. But I did get a set of vintage candlesticks for a very reasonable price. But finally I- Well, I admire your persistence. Oh. Oh. I'm sorry, I have to take this. Hello? I'll make sure that she signs it for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Don't come and see me. Stop calling. I have nothing more to say to you. You're gonna wear a hole in that carpet. Ethan? It's been a long time, Ange. You look good. You too. Nervous? Oh, uh... I- I just wasn't uh... I wasn't expecting so many people. Well, your show does reach over a million viewers a week. Yes, but I can't see any of them. Ah. So you're here with Evergreen? You're looking at the new editor and CEO. What? You never expressed any interest in publishing. In fact, last I checked you were off working at a consulting firm in Seattle. Not that I was checking up on you, it was just, you know, run of the mill grapevine. It was important to my mother that it stay in the family. She uh, passed recently. I'm so sorry. Right. The transition's been a little bumpy. Most of the authors have been supportive. Others... less so. How could you blindside me like this? What good are you if you can't get me out of these commitments? Did you even try? Wow. My mother did say Beatrice Penn had a way with words. It's just too bad she couldn't repeat any of them in polite company. Would you like to have dinner sometime this week? I don't know if that's such a good idea. Just two old friends catching up. You know what? Just think about it. I know that look. I've written four novels on that look. Ex-husband? Boyfriend. Ah. So all you got out of the split was heartbreak? Helen Travers. Angie Dove. I know. You've seen the standee. No. - I watch your show. - Oh. Showtime, ladies! Here are some prepared trivia questions should you run into any lulls, alright? I know you're gonna be great. I thought we were waiting for one more author? Sylvia Donner? Our third author is a no-show. And there's another panel right after this so we can't stall. We're just gonna have to make do. Ok. What an unpleasant surprise seeing your name on the poster. I thought it was time to bury the hatchet. And just where were you planning on burying it? Hello, Philadelphia, and welcome to the Written in the Stars Romance Writer's Panel. Thank you so much for coming out. Before we get to your burning questions in the Q & A segment, our writers will share selected readings from their work. First up, it is my honour to introduce two-time award-winning author, Beatrice Penn. Thank you. I'd like to begin by uh, reading a passage from "Hearts on Fire", the first of my Gilded Hearts Trilogy. I know many of you here might be anticipating an announcement today regarding the final book in the series, but I'm afraid there- there are no updates on that front. While you're waiting you can pick up "Autumn of Lonely Hearts", available now wherever books are sold. I do appreciate the enthusiasm around the book. You've all been very loyal and for that I am so truly grateful. That's a lie. I'm sorry? You claim to care about your fans but the truth is you don't care about us at all. That's not true. You'll happily take our money and our time but you will never return it. Security! Why don't you answer my letters? You're nothing but a fraud. Karma's coming for you! Uh... Uh, I see here that we are supposed to do a round of romance trivia next. That sounds fun. We don't have to wait, we can do that now. No, it's quite alright. I can continue. Ok. "Thomas knew from the moment he saw her, "Dominique was the woman of his dreams. "Her chestnut hair, swept into a delicate braid that seemed to-" Excuse me. Here, take her this. Please. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Ah, there we go. Let's try this again, shall we? "Her appearance had awoken something in his heart." "Something he never knew existed there. He-" "closed his... eyes and... he closed his-" Are you alright? I'm fine, I just uh, I think I need a moment. Bea? Do- do you need help? Should I get someone? I think I need to lie down. Ok, come on. It was so strange. One minute she was fine and the next she looked like she was gonna faint. Stage fright? She's done book tours all over the country. I mean, public speaking should be a walk in the park for her. They even took her to the hospital just to be safe. Then she's in good hands. You're right. I'm sure she's fine. Ok, ready to meet our bachelorette? My name is Nancy Upton, I'm 35 years old and I'm ready to be swept off my feet by Prince Charming. What's been your biggest hurdle to finding love? My schedule. Between my law practise and volunteer work I don't have much time to date. What kind of volunteer work do you do? I mentor student athletes. Oh. What're you looking for in a partner? Well, Angie, I have worked hard to get to where I'm at today, so I want someone who shares my commitment to success. I won't settle for anything less. She gave me this before she left. Everyone has an idea of their perfect match, huh? It's double-sided. You know, I'm not sure about this one. She seems too hard to please. Ah, you know what? I like a good challenge. She wants Prince Charming? I'm gonna find him. Well, I hope so, because I'm pretty sure she'd turn down an actual prince. Uh, number 44. No complicated family commitments. Miss Columba. Detective. Poisoning? Like she had some bad take-out and will be fine in a few days? No. I'm afraid Beatrice Penn is dead. We'll know more after the autopsy but that's the preliminary determination from the coroner. You're talking about murder. When did she die? Yesterday, shortly after she arrived at the hospital. I know this isn't a good time but I just want to ask you a few questions about the convention and what you saw. I'd be happy to help in any way I can. Ok. You were moderating a writer's panel? I was supposed to. We didn't get very far past introductions before Beatrice started having trouble. Trouble? Was she exhibiting confusion, slurred speech? Well, she seemed rattled, but I thought it was because she was heckled by that fan. She had an altercation with a fan? Yes, and it really threw her. She couldn't concentrate so they brought her something to drink... Who did? Uh, the coordinator, Beth. I'm afraid that bottle could be anywhere. Our staff cleaned the hall top to bottom last night, of course not realizing that it was going to be a crime scene. Ok. Do you guys still have the trash from the convention? In the dumpsters. They collect it at the end of the week. Ok, and those are what, in the parking lot? Basement. Although, I should warn you they aren't exclusively used by the convention centre. It's waste disposal for the whole hotel. Alright. Uh, what kind of security measures did you have in place for the convention? Well, we had security guards on site, bags were checked at the front entrance. And cameras? Yes. Uh, cameras were in the lobby and the convention rooms. Ok. I'm gonna need a list of all the vendors, staff, anybody that set foot in this place. Of course. Appreciate your help. Thank you. Detective Carter? I may not know where the bottle ended up but I do know where it came from. Hello? Miss Dove? Yes? This is Margaret Vincent. Um, Beth gave me your number, I hope that's ok. Oh, of course. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. I want you to know I'm cooperating with the police. I'll do whatever I can to help. I appreciate that. Um, but it's not why I'm calling. I have your book. Bea signed it for you. Here we go. Is this Beatrice? It is. Awe. And um, that one's me. You've known each other a long time. Well, since the day I was born. We're sisters. Oh. I- I thought that- That I was her assistant. Well, I suppose I am that, too. Hmm. Bea, she loved to dance. Our mother used to say she came into the world with ballet slippers on. She was accepted to Juilliard off of a single audition. Wow. She must have been over the moon. Well, except she um, she never made it. The summer before she was set to leave she had an unfortunate accident. She was at a rock quarry swimming with friends and... she was navigating a ledge. It was slippery. She shattered her hip. Oh. It was a dream dashed in the blink of an eye. Well, it looks like she found a new one. Silver lining. Uh, Ted. That's Beatrice's ex-husband. They separated um, six months ago but uh, the divorce papers were as good as signed. I'm not so sure. If he's not out of her picture frames he's probably not out of her heart. So after 15 years of marriage you agreed to a trial separation? Yeah, that's right. We had decided that we needed some time apart. Was that Ms. Penn's suggestion? No, it was mine. We had both been under a lot of strain for quite a while. Our jobs were very demanding and, well, I thought we needed some space. You work at um... uh, Amore Trattoria? I own it, yeah. When's the last time you saw your wife? I haven't had any contact with Beatrice in months. Margaret made sure of that. That's her sister? Yeah. Yeah, Margaret could be very protective of Beatrice. She didn't even tell me that Beatrice had died. I had to hear about it from one of my waitresses who read about it online. Where were you on the day of Ms. Penn's death? I was working. Do you have anybody that can corroborate that? My kitchen staff. Ok. If you need anything at all, please let me know. You have my number. Thank you. Yeah, it's been a really hard few days. I mean, the only thing I really need is to see Ethan Plume behind bars. Ethan? You think he has something to do with Beatrice's murder? Well, I know he did. Why would he want to hurt your sister? Revenge? For what? Well, he holds Bea responsible for his mother's death. I'm sorry. I need to take this. Can you show yourself out? Yeah. Ok. Hi... Uh, just the cheque, please. What? Since when does Angie Columba turn down dessert? It's been a long time. People change. Like your name, Angie Dove. Well, it's for TV. No, no. I- I like it. You still twirl your hair when you've got something on your mind, though. Uh, I went to see Margaret Vincent today. How is she? Uh, overwhelmed, I think. And uh, she seems to think that you had something to do with Beatrice's murder. You don't look surprised. I'm not. Maybe you misunderstood me. She thinks you killed her sister. With poison. Oh, he didn't do it. Right? No, of course not. Ok, so why does she think you had a vendetta against Beatrice? Because I told her so. Beatrice was planning to leave Evergreen Publishing. It would be a big blow financially. Sales were down, my mother had already downsized the offices. This could be the death now. It became contentious. Beatrice owed my mother her career. The first manuscripts she submitted, they were terrible. Other publishing houses wouldn't even give her the time of day. But my mother took a chance on her and this is how she repaid her? Anyway, last week when she came into the office, Beatrice and I had words. You threatened her? I may have let my temper get the best of me. Ethan! I know. I know it was a mistake. And Margaret heard you? The whole office heard. But I promise you, I had nothing to do with her death. Ange, in the two years we were together did I ever lie to you? Once. Our senior year of college when you pretended you weren't gonna make it to my birthday dinner. I wanted to surprise you. But when I showed up at the restaurant you already had a drink waiting for me. That fake cough wasn't gonna win you any Academy Awards. See? I could never get anything past you. Uh, excuse me. On second thought, uh... we'll have the double chocolate mousse. There she is. You know what? You better make it two spoons, yeah. Kyle. Ethan Plume? Yes. I'm gonna need you to come with me, please. Is there a problem? You're under arrest for the murder of Beatrice Penn. Wha? Uh... Kyle, please. He's innocent. Any updates? Oh, not since you asked... five minutes ago. You know, the old Chief of Detectives is on his way. Oh, cool. Say hi for me. Coming. I'm being stonewalled. Where's Ethan? They hauled him into an interrogation room over an hour ago and I haven't heard anything since. You should probably head home. Your date's being processed. He's gonna have to spend the night in county. He's not my date. But, more importantly, he is not a killer. Hey, good to have you back on the old stomping grounds. Kyle. Dad, tell him. Uh, what've you got? Off the record. Well, we have one witness that links Ethan to the water bottle and three witnesses to Ethan's very public threat against the victim. Circumstantial, right? That'll be for a judge to decide. It's good to see you, Nick. Sorry for ruining your dessert. You don't look it! Isn't there something we can do? Not tonight, sweetheart. Come on, let's go home, huh? I've cleared a few times with Nancy for the dates, now we just need to settle on our suitors. Angie? The matches? Right. Right- actually, I have narrowed down the eligible candidates to two. We have Thomas, investment banker, MBA from Harvard, likes high stakes poker and wind surfing. He's perfect. And we have Peter. His photo alone violates six of our rules. Yes, but he has a lot of qualities that will make them very compatible. She's expecting a shark. She's not gonna be happy when we bring her a guppy. Expectations can be like a blindfold. We can get so caught up in what we think we should have in a partner that we close ourselves off to opportunities. Well, a blindfold might come in handy. That sweater is really busy. He's not gonna wear it on the date, Paige. We just need to show Nancy what she's missing. It's a conditional release. I have to be back in court in three weeks. What're you gonna do? I wanna find the girl who confronted Beatrice at the panel. The fan? Yeah, I recognized her. It took me a moment to place her but she came by the publishing house last week looking for Beatrice. She refused to leave the lobby. We had her escorted out by security. She had a VIP lanyard. She would have had access backstage. Yeah, I can't be sure but I think I saw her lurking around before the panel. Huh. We should talk to Beth at the convention centre. Yeah, about those conditions of my release? I'm not allowed in the hotel. Over 80 people ordered VIP passes. But you'd have receipts, right? Order forms, or... For online sales, yes, but they were also available for cash purchase day of. Did security confiscate her pass? So? Ta-dah. Oh, you are awesome. Hold that hug. We have a teensy set-back. Caroline. Caroline what? I don't know. And since it's written in Sharpie that means she didn't pre-order it so there's no paper trail. So we're back to square one. Well, not exactly. Caroline complained that Beatrice hadn't responded to her letters, which means she must have written fan mail. So if we could find those letters... We'd have a name and address. I'll take that hug now. Yes! Sorry. No, it's fine. I'm just excited. Is that you in the blue? What're you doing in my office? I was told to wait for you in here. By who? A PA. I just had a few follow-up questions, if you don't mind. I do, actually. Well, I was promised your full cooperation. That was before you arrested Ethan. I just wanna find the truth, ok? Wherever that leads me. Please. Now, you were with Mr. Plume before the panel began, right? I was. Ok. And after, did you uh, reconnect? No. The panel was cut short. I didn't see him again that day. Hmm. Well, that doesn't mean anything. It was a big convention. Really? You really find it suspicious that I didn't see Ethan after the panel? No, but I do find it suspicious that no one did. I have to admit, it seems a little far-fetched. I mean, Bea's fans could be passionate, but murder? There seemed to be more behind Caroline's anger than just a missed deadline. It felt personal, you know? Maybe. What are the odds you still have those letters? Well, we usually toss everything after Bea opens it but she had boxes of letters that she never got to. Margaret? I thought I locked this. How could I be so careless? Maybe you weren't. That says "disarmed". Someone was in here. Was anything taken? I don't know. It looks like they were searching for something. Margaret... Hold on... Margaret... Wait. We should call the police. The motion sensors! The motion detectors in the backyard were tripped, but we didn't see anyone. Um... Two crime scenes in four days, huh? I know what you're gonna say. Is that so? Angie, so nice to see you. I couldn't ask for a better witness in these trying times. Is that a new dress? It really suits you. Close? No. But that is a nice dress. Thank you. I got it on sale. Just an impulse buy. We checked the entire perimeter, there were no signs of forced entry. So according to the security company the alarm was never triggered. Are you sure that you set it before you left? Well, it's like second nature. I wouldn't forget. Who else has access to the code? Besides me and Bea? Well, only one other person. Ted. Margaret claimed that you called her multiple times the day after Beatrice's death. That's right. I wanted to offer her my condolences. She said that you wanted to meet up. Well, it seemed like the kind of thing that you do in person. And she offered to meet you here at the restaurant but you insisted on meeting at Ms. Penn's estate. She just lost her sister, ok? I wasn't gonna make her come to me. No other reason? No loose ends to tie up at the house? I took everything that I needed to when I left six months ago. Where were you last night at 8:00 p.m.? I was at home. Catching up on some much-needed sleep. I usually vacation in Milan. With access to a private jet. It's really a crime not to. Mmm. Do you travel much? Well, I spent last summer in L.A. with the youth Olympics. I started working with student athletes a few years ago. It's been really life-changing helping them reach their goals. I volunteered at the Girls and Boys Club of America for two months. - Ok. - Mmmhmm. So you understand how rewarding it can be. Absolutely. It uh, looked fantastic on the resume. Prince Charming came to play. He's totally winning her over. Her non-verbals are telling another story. She's smiling. Her lips are pressed together. Look. It's a classic sign of discomfort. Look how her body is angled away from his. She wants to like him more than she does. For a swing and a miss you seem pretty pleased. I don't think they're a match. Well, if you didn't think they would hit it off why are we here? Because sometimes we need to get what we think what we want in order to realize what we really need. You sound like a fortune cookie. - Hey. - Hi. What do you think so far? He's um, everything I asked for. Uh, can I see that? Yeah. Hi, I'm uh, looking for Ethan Plume. Hey. The receptionist said it was ok to come right in. Hey. What's going on? Are you leaving? I thought it'd be best for the company if I stepped down, so this is my last week. Why? I can't let this investigation destroy something that my mother built from nothing. Ok, this is just temporary, right? You said it yourself. I never really had the stomach for publishing so... That's not what I said- Close enough. It was a long time ago, we- I got what you meant. I don't... I don't know why I thought I could step into her shoes. Ethan, you can't give up. We can fix this. I think it's too late, Ange. You made a promise to her. I- I know things are hard right now but if you walk away from this it'll be the biggest regret of your life. That wouldn't be the biggest regret. Dad? Yeah. It's me. Hey. Wh... What's all this? Oh, I've been taking some painting classes down at the community centre. I never knew you were interested in art. Yeah. Well, I went down to sign up for Zoomba but it was full so I figured why not try something out of my comfort zone? Zoomba's in your comfort zone? Yeah. What do you think? I'm gonna surprise your mother for her birthday. That's really sweet. But? Uh, no but. Oh. Maybe a tiny "however". An "although" at most. Ah. It's just, dad, I thought you and mom were taking time to figure things out. What does something like this say? I think it says I'm still thinking about her. Seems like a good place to start. Well, I like it. Yeah? Yeah. Look at that sunrise. Maybe add some, like, rays shooting out of it? That's a banana. It's a fruit bowl. Oh. You know, I see it. I see it now. Yeah. Yeah, well, I've got a few more classes left to go. Why don't you sit down here? Um, have you heard from Ethan? He made bail but he's worried that he's the only one on the police's radar. Well, if they think he's their guy they'll be building a case against him. He um, he asked me to help him. Angie, I don't think you should be meddling in an active investigation. Again. I'm not meddling. Much. You can never say no to that young man. Are you forgetting that I'm the one who ended things? Mmm. And it broke your heart. Well, what was I supposed to do? I had my life here in Philadelphia and he wanted to go off and see the world. I wasn't gonna hold him back. Hmm. He's in trouble, Dad. And he doesn't have anyone else. Are you sure that's all this is? Yes, I'm sure. Besides, right now is not exactly the best time for romance. But you're the one that's always saying romance can happen at any time. There's an asterisk for murder investigations. I just don't want you to get hurt. I won't. Toxicology report on the Penn murder. They found strychnine in her system. Have them run it again. Again? Yeah. A witness has Penn collapsing shortly after receiving the water bottle from Ethan Plume, right? Mmmhmm. Now, strychnine, it takes a minimum of 20 minutes before it even starts even manifesting symptoms. Ok. So if this is our poison then... It had to have been consumed much earlier. There you go. Very good. You're good. Hi. I'm Detective Carter. I'm looking for Sylvia Donner. Oh, look no further. Come on in. It's a pen name. No one wants to read a book about romance from someone named Neil Garfunkle. Do you have a minute to answer some questions about Beatrice Penn? Of course. We were just about to sit down for tea. We? Hi. Of course. Hello. Yeah. Welcome. So, I understand you were supposed to be on this romance writer's panel with uh, Ms. Penn? Yeah. What happened? Um, alternator. Car conked out on me before I could make it three blocks. My wife's been telling me to get it checked out but I... I put it off. That- that's the car that's in the driveway now? No, our SUV. We should probably sell it but I've had it so long I'm kind of attached to it. So you didn't make it to the hotel at all? Got the call to Triple A and a bruised ego to prove it. Hmm. Historical romance, sword and sandals, something with a... a brooding male lead. I think that'll be right up your alley. "Seduction in the Arena"? Three weeks on the best seller list. Thank you, but uh, I prefer mysteries. Oh. I write those, too. I got a new one coming out next fall. I'll get you an advance copy. Oh. Can we get back to Beatrice Penn, please? Oh, right. Uh, have you spoken with Helen Travers? The other writer there on the panel? Mmmhmm. A lot of bad blood there. The two of them could barely stand being in the same room together. I'm actually surprised they both agreed to do the panel. And she told you this? It's a small community. Everyone knows everything about everyone. Do you know how the feud started? Uh, yeah. A couple years ago there was a big dust up at a writer's retreat. What kind of dust up? Helen was set to headline a workshop, very prestigious, and a huge boon coming off her first book. Then Beatrice's schedule opened up at the last minute and she bumped Helen right off the poster. Things got quite heated, Helen was asked to leave. After it happened Helen started telling anyone that would listen that Beatrice used a ghost writer for her books. Did she? Personally I think it was sour grapes, but it infuriated Beatrice, and they've been trading blows in the press ever since. Oh. I didn't realize we had guests. Rebecca. This is my wife, Rebecca. Rebecca, this is uh- Angie Dove. You never told me you know Angie Dove. Stick with me. It's nice to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. Wow. "Angie Dove. "She'll find you love." Oh, I'm sorry. You must be her assistant? No, I'm Detective Carter, ma'am. They're here about Beatrice Penn. Oh. Such a tragedy. My heart goes out to her family. So it looks like you got those car troubles fixed. Car troubles? Yeah, you remember, honey. It stalled out on me the day of the convention? I... I told you that. Oh, of course. Right. You have to forgive my wife, I think she's a little star struck. Honey, you should have used the good china. Oh, no, no. Everything's been wonderful. You have a lovely home, by the way. I just love your show so much. I never miss it. You know, we're filming an episode later this week. You should come to the set. Oh, no. No, I couldn't. You would be my guest. Say yes. Ok. Wow. Thank you. He's hiding something. Yeah, everyone is. Did you notice how he shifted in his seat when he talked about the car? Well, it is an intimidating situation. A police interrogation? No, tea time with the great Angie Dove. So I guess we should talk to Helen Travers next. Helen was on stage when the murder happened. She wasn't even in the bottle's chain of possession. The bottle wasn't poisoned backstage. What do you mean? Well, it couldn't have been. Strychnine takes at least 20 minutes to take effect. How do you know that? Google. No, how do you know what kind of poison was used? Oh, it was in today's paper. Well, the afternoon update of the online edition of today's paper. I have alerts on my phone. The coroner was supposed to have redacted that report. I don't know what to tell you. Beatrice was a high-profile figure. There's a lot of public interest. Oh, I know. So we should talk to Helen. But you know, it was such a big window of opportunity. I mean, everyone at the convention is a suspect. Everyone, huh? Including you? Really? I'm not gonna dignify that with an answer. Are those next week's matches? Oh, no. No. Possible murder suspects. You know what? It's probably better that I don't ask. I'll come back later. Hey. Do you know how we could find Helen Travers? When I spoke to her at the convention she mentioned getting away to write. Did she say where? No, but I could ask around. Maybe her manager knows. She's probably holed up in a hotel room somewhere. Hotel room? Beatrice said she was going back to her hotel room to freshen up before the panel. I wonder if something in that room could tell us more about how she spent the final hour of her life. Hello. Checking in? No. I was hoping you might be able to help me. Well, I'll certainly try. I misplaced my room key and I'd love to get another one. No problem. Great. Your room number? 721. I'm sorry, there are no current reservations for room 721. I- normally I don't like doing this but uh... I'm Angie Dove. From The Matchmaker with Angie Dove. It's on Saturday evenings, 7:30 to 8:00? I prefer cooking shows. It's just really time sensitive that I get up there. Oh, wait. Right here. See? Written in the Stars Philadelphia welcomes special guest, Angie Dove. Angie Dove. I'm sorry, I don't see it. Really? I thought it was a pretty good likeness. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No. Excuse me. Can I please get some extra towels in here? Oh, I'm not- I'm- I will be right with you. Towels are on the rack. I also refilled your shampoos. I noticed you were out. Oh, thank you. First date? That obvious? To me. I'm meeting someone for dinner. Went to high school together but I never had the guts to ask her out. I really wanna make a good first impression. Second first impression? Try the blue. It brings out your eyes. Before you go down there just take a few deep breaths and relax. You're gonna do great. Thank you. Ok. Oh, wait. Uh, your tip. Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't possibly- Please. I insist. Ok. Thanks. E.P. Ethan Plume. What am I looking at? Evidence. I think. Maybe. I found that cufflink in Beatrice's hotel room. Is it yours? No. It's monogrammed E.P. It's not mine, Angie. Ok. You think it belongs to the person who murdered Beatrice? If the cufflink fits... We'll know more once the police run tests for fingerprints or- No, you can't show the police. But if it's not yours- It has my initials on it. According to you it has someone else's initials on it. Well, how do I prove that? By showing them the receipt from when I didn't buy them? Well, I- Look, we- we just can't give the police another reason to look my way. Ethan, we're gonna figure out who really did this. There's no reason to hide from the truth, right? Right. So uh, what's the secret? Hmm? Of "Lover's Lane"? Oh, I have no idea. I'm only on the first chapter. - It's research. - Oh. What can I do for you, Angie? I uh, I have a tip for you. If this is about my hairstyle again, I'm good. No, it looks great. Oh, thanks. Beatrice had a room at the hotel. I know. 721. We did a sweep. Well, you may want to sweep again. Why? Call it a hunch. Ted Penn. He works at Amore Trattoria? That's awfully close to the convention site. Thank you for your hunch, Angie, I really appreciate it. Is there anything else I can do for you today? No. Just um, let me know when you find it. You know I can't share details about an ongoing investigation with you. I meant "The Secret of Lover's Lane". Oh. You'll be the first to know. You know, she's taller in person. Ok. What've you got for me? Uh, background on Neil Garfunkle. Nabbed for a DUI a couple years back but otherwise he's squeaky clean. Ok, what about the uh, disgruntled fan? We asked convention staff, guests, but uh, still no name. Well, keep asking. Thanks. You got it. I got your message. What was so important I had to come right over? I found the perfect place for Nancy and Peter's date. Amore Trattoria. A restaurant? Yeah. What better way for two people to connect than over some wine and tapas? We put Nancy and Thomas in a hot air balloon. It'll be great. Trust me. Anyway, we have a meeting with the head chef and owner, Ted Penn. Penn, as in Beatrice Penn? There may be a tangential connection. How tangential? Husband. Are you using the show as a cover for a rogue murder investigation? No, I'm- I'm multitasking. So, what's his story? Ok, alright. So according to Margaret, Ted and Beatrice were separated but divorce was imminent. I mean, Beatrice was very wealthy. What did Ted stand to lose in a divorce? Where was he on the day she was murdered? He claims he was working. And we're here to confirm his alibi? And to try the crab cakes. If those are good, everything will be good. Miss Dove, let me just tell you that I am thrilled you would consider my restaurant for your show. Oh... I am curious how you chose us. Oh, um, I saw a write-up. Ah, I see. Well, now I'm thinking that we offer a menu that's fun and flirty, one that really promotes conversation. Now, these- these are some of the things we can do. For example, we could start with a lovely amuse bouche. We do a warm goat cheese tart. Um, bad breath. It's not... Well, it's just a jumping off point, we have a very diverse menu. You might actually want to consider some of the specials that we've had. Now, we've had some tremendous feedback on social media. For example, this is our tomato pie and it is a show-stopper. And we have delicious crab cakes. Uh, may I? Please. Thank you. Wow, these look wonderful. So many choices. You know, it might take me a minute to just, um, you know, narrow it down. Oh, um, Mr. Penn. Um, would it be possible to see back of the house operations for logistical purposes? Cameras, lighting. Of course. In fact, you can sample some of our dishes. Great. Um, I'll uh, catch up with you. I'll just- just- kind of... I read his text messages with Beatrice and she wanted to meet with him the night before she was murdered. Well, did they meet up? I don't know, the texts stop after that. But she wanted to talk about something important. Well, maybe she was finally serving him with divorce papers. I don't know. Hey, those crab cakes were good, though, right? Yeah, yeah. You sure this is the place? Yeah, 304 Birch. We could just knock on her door. I guess. Hi, can I help you folks? Uh, we're looking for Caroline Higgins. Higgins. How do you know Caroline? - We're friends. - We're family. We're friends of the family. Friends. Uh, do you know when she might be back? Caroline doesn't live here anymore. When did she move? Last week. Very abruptly. Zero notice. Um, if you do see her, would you ask her to contact me? - Ok. - Thanks. Uh, who breaks a lease with no notice? Someone who doesn't wanna be found. So I reviewed the survei from the break-in like you asked. This SUV passes the gate three times in 20 minutes. Almost as if the driver's circling the block. Time? About an hour before the break-in. I mean, they could be lost. Or they could be making sure the coast is clear. Did you manage to pull the plate? I tried, but uh, this is the best footage we have. There's no better angle. Ok, well send it down to forensics, see if they have any luck. Good work. Thanks. Caroline Higgins brings our suspect list up to four. Our? Well, every Sherlock needs a Watson. I thought I was here for a production meeting. Ok. Alright. We have Neil, alright? He was the third author in the panel where Beatrice collapsed. Did he do something to raise your suspicions? At the panel? He never showed. How could he have done it, then? Just because no one saw him doesn't mean he wasn't there. He claimed to have car trouble. You think he was lying. Well, he says he has proof but the timing was convenient. Then there's Helen Travers. She has a history of bad blood with Beatrice. I mean, a lot of animosity there. And she was backstage at the panel and would have access to Beatrice's drink. Well, that wouldn't imply guilt because the drink wasn't poisoned backstage. How do you know that? Google. But Helen's VIP status would have allowed more access to the drink before then, if that's even how Beatrice was poisoned. And then there's Ted Penn, Beatrice's ex. Beatrice was contemplating divorce. As her husband he likely stood to inherit the fortune. If she divorced him, not so much. But I think she was still in love with him. Aren't you missing someone? Who? Ethan Plume? No, no, I'm trying to prove that he didn't do it. Oh. He must have had a compelling motive. He was arrested, after all. Well, I- I don't have a picture of him. This is Ethan? You sure do have a type. Tall, dark, and brooding. Ok, one ex does not make a type. What about Detective Carter. What? I don't- that is not a thing. I'm not- I'm- that's not- he's... It's Ethan. Hello? Hey. I found Helen Travers. Great! What's the address? I'll text it to Kyle. Hey. Sorry, I'm late. Traffic was a nightmare. What're you doing here? What do you mean? I'm the one who sent you the address. Yeah, but I assumed that's where your involvement ended. Well, you know what they say about assumptions. Um... I... Oh... uh... Thank you. Thank you. When Ethan said Helen was on a writer's retreat I thought it'd be a little more day spa, a little less cabin in the woods. I don't know. It's not too late to turn back. Nice try. But we should have a strategy going in. I'm thinking good cop, bad cop. Do you have a preference? Angie, look- I could go either way, but you do have a natural scowl that would lend itself to bad cop. What? That's the one. Oh, good. We go straight. It's a blaze. It marks the trail for hikers. Yeah, I know what it is, I'm just surprised you do. Oh. My mom's an avid hiker. I tagged along on all sorts of trails growing up. I never would have taken you for the outdoorsy type. And why is that? I'm just surprised, that's all. I love nature. My heels, not so much. I used to go camping with my brothers all the time. We made it into this uh, tradition. Oh, would you look at that? Common ground. Huh, who'd have thunk? I mean, we're not that different. Yeah? How do you figure? Well, we're both public servants. People trust you to solve their murders and they trust me to solve their love lives. I think it's a little bit different, I mean, I'm dealing with life and death. So you've never been to a single's mixer in the city. No, I- Ah! Oh, oh, I got you. I got you. Thank you. Uh, we made it. Oh, we did. Miss Travers? What is she doing? Finding her centre? 45 minutes of daily meditation helps the muse. But I suppose five will have to do for today. Well, sorry for the interruption, but we just had a few questions about Beatrice Penn. Like why just days after her murder you're hiding out in the middle of nowhere. Uh, we never settled on bad cop so I just ran with it. Was that ok? Yeah. I'm on a deadline. I come up here to block out the outside world and to get away from distractions. What was your relationship with Beatrice Penn? Professional acquaintances. We've heard "bitter rivals" is a better way to describe you. I'm sorry, I thought you were a matchmaker. Oh, I do that, too. It's no secret she and I have a rocky past. Is it true that you started the rumour that she didn't write her own books? I used to admire Beatrice. But after a few conversations it was clear that she wasn't who she presented herself to be. How's that? I read the Gilded Hearts books and let's just say I'm not sure she has. But if you ask me if you wanna know who killed Beatrice Penn there's only one person you should be looking at. Margaret Vincent. Her sister? They seem so close. Margaret has always been in Beatrice's shadow. It's not a nice place to be. Speaking from experience? Sure, she had better book sales. But there's no accounting for taste. Beatrice had a bad temper and Margaret was usually on the receiving end. She would blow up about the tiniest thing. A person can only take so much, you know? But you think she could actually hurt her own sister? It wouldn't be the first time. What do you mean? Rumour has it, that so-called "accident" that left Beatrice with a cane wasn't an accident at all. Margaret said Beatrice slipped on some rocks. I'm sure she did. Hey. I got the plate of that SUV circling the Penn estate the night of the break-in. Alright, did you pull the registration? Sure did. It belongs to Ted Penn. I surprised my father with third row seats, right on the first base line. - Mmmhmm. Almost caught a line drive. Do you like baseball? Not really. No. This isn't going well. She'll warm up to him. Just give it some time. He's a catch. She looks like she wants to throw him back. Patience. Sorry, you have um... Oh, uh, I think it's just finger paint. One of my kids must have got me the other day. How many kids do you have? 32. I'm a teacher. Really? Yeah. Second grade. You know, I never saw myself going into education but there's something about working with kids that's really inspiring. Yeah. Yeah, there is. It's like you get to be a part of someone's biggest moments, share in their little victories. I'm probably boring you. No. No, you're not. I know exactly what you mean. I mentor student athletes. And that is why you should never judge a book by its cover. You were right. Told ya. From here on out, smooth sailing. You can't just come into my place of work like this. I'm telling you, this is some kind of mistake. I haven't done anything wrong! Cut! Well, that date will certainly be a memorable one. You said you were at home the night of the break-in. I was. You mind explaining what you were doing at Beatrice's house? Technically, it's still my house, too. Ok. We weren't divorced. Then why all the subterfuge? Why'd you circle the block three times? Why didn't you just walk right in? Look, it's no secret that Margaret wasn't exactly my biggest fan. I hoped to slip in and out of the house unnoticed to avoid a confrontation. What were you doing in the den? There were some items I wanted to retrieve, they held some value to me. Sentimental or monetary? Both. It still doesn't explain why you felt the need to break in. Beatrice's will left everything to Margaret. If I had waited for her to sort through the possessions of the home, she'd contest my claim. I just wanted what was mine. This yours? Yeah. Long story. What's this? Our production schedule. Are you planning any arrests at these dates or locations? Not at the moment, but... That's the second dessert you torpedoed. Hmm. Guess that means I owe you one. I- I may hold you to that. Ok. I'll- I'll leave this with you, here, just in case. That's uh... that's good. Then I'll know where you're at. Paige. It- relax. Just send me all the footage we have, I'm sure there's enough to salvage the episode. We playing in the uh, charity basketball game next weekend? 11-43's got a new big boy, about 6'-9", I think uh, he's a ringer. No. No, I'm actually gonna head out to uh, Deep Creek with Lucy. Lucy? Oh, I bet she'll love that. Yeah. Alright. Angie. I took your advice, I had the conversation with Paul to see where the relationship was going. And? Congratulations. Thank you so much. Ok, you. Let's go. Where you're going you're not gonna be dating anyone for a while. Hello? Why is my name on this very colourful board? Caroline. My landlord gave me your card. He asked why I never mentioned I was close personal friends with Angie Dove. I... I may have slightly exaggerated our relationship. Why? Because I wanted to ask you about Beatrice Penn. I have nothing to do with her. You mean aside from some pretty angry letters and a trip to Evergreen Publishing? You think I had something to do with her death because of some fan mail? I'm not accusing you of anything, I just- I want to know what she did to make you so upset. My grandmother bought me the Gilded Hearts books a few years ago. They're her favourite. She wanted to share them with me. So she'd make us tea and we'd talk about the characters for hours. It brought her so much joy, you know? And then she got sick. I'm sorry. The books mean so much to her. I know it would mean the world if she could finish the trilogy. It's been two years since the last book was announced, I thought if Beatrice knew how little time she had... But she never responded. I would have accepted a "no". I understand it was a lot to ask. But to ignore my letters? It just made me really mad. But why did you leave your apartment so suddenly? I moved in with my grandmother. Her health's declined. She needed me. Is this a good time? Sure. Um, please excuse the mess. The uh, movers are due tomorrow. I still have so much packing left to do. You're- you're selling the house? Yeah. Yeah, I had an interested buyer as soon as I listed it. Well, it must be hard. I'm sure it holds a lot of memories for you. Well, that um, is exactly what I'm hoping to get away from. I spoke to Caroline Higgins. You found her. She found me. It turns out her grandmother is very sick and she had hoped Beatrice might share an early manuscript of the third book in the series. And she was angry when her letters went unanswered. Yeah. I can understand that. The series has come to mean a lot to many people. What is the status of the last book? Well, it's uh... it's finished. Oh. Well, why hasn't it come out? Well, the situation is complicated. With Evergreen Publishing? Among other things, yeah. You're a writer? Uh, no. Uh... there's only one writer in the family. It- it wasn't me. I was gonna make some tea, did you want some? Uh, sure. Ok. It was right there, in one of the boxes. And it was open. There are harmless applications to rat poison, like vermin control. Tell that to the rats. Look, Angie. It's a piece of the puzzle. It's not the whole puzzle. I- I just- I- I just can't believe that Margaret would kill her own sister. Sweetheart, your instincts are usually right. What do you think? It's really nice. Yeah? Somebody else painted it, right? Yeah. It's ok. Thank you guys so much for coming by. We're excited to be here. Oh, we can take those for you. Thank you. Thank you. Here is our set where Angie will tape the final decision on today's couple. These cameras feed to a monitor over there so you'll be able to watch it as it happens. Wow, exciting. So, Peter, how was your date with Nancy? Before or after the police raid? Uh... It was nice. I felt like we really connected. Me too. That's why I asked you here today. I believe that Peter is Nancy's perfect match. Now, Peter, would you like to see Nancy again? I'd love to, yeah. Ok. Well, I spoke with Nancy before the show and now the choice is hers. If she'd like to go on a second date she'll join us here on set. Nancy? It's the moment of truth. Do you agree that Peter is your perfect match? It was so moving. Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I admit, I was a little worried that Nancy might not come out on stage. Well, that's just for the cameras. I would never set Peter up like that if I didn't know Nancy was a yes. Ah. I appreciate a dramatic reveal. Would you like to meet the happy couple? We'd love to. Of course. Thank you, Angie. This has made her whole year. Oh, my pleasure. It's been hard, you know, with the book tour and release schedule. We haven't seen a lot of each other. She means a lot to you, huh? Oh. The love of my life. Goodnight, Carl. You have a good night, Miss Dove. Margaret. Can we talk? Is everything alright? I don't know what to do. Bea always knew what to do and, well, now she's gone. Why don't you sit down and tell me what's wrong? Everything. I never meant to hurt her, you have to believe me. What do you mean? I haven't been honest with you. Is- is this- It's the final book in the trilogy. I don't understand. Did you have something to do with Beatrice's death? No, of course not. Then... the accident? She was everything that I wasn't. She was pretty, popular... I idolized her. That day at the quarry I followed her onto that ledge. I wanted everyone to believe that I was just as brave as my big sister. She got mad at me for tagging after her. We argued. She was trying to get away from me when she slipped. And then she never danced again. Her dream was gone in an instant. I stole that from her. So you gave her yours. Well, fame and fortune were always meant for her. So I wrote the books and uh, let her have the spotlight. I could never hurt my sister. Not when I've already taken so much from her. Margaret, you were a kid. You can't carry this burden forever. I just don't know what to do. I have an idea on where to start. Hi, Caroline. Is your grandmother home? Come in. Burning the midnight oil, hey, Miss Dove? Yeah, I have some things to wrap up. Alright. Oh, you can head home. I'll be fine. Sweet. Forensics just came out on the cufflink. Hey, hold on. We got a hit. Partial print. I'm- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, I uh, I think I left my scarf here. Oh. Uh, that's fine, I'll help you find it. It's blue. Cashmere. It was a gift from my wife. I've turned the whole house over looking for it. I'm sure we can track it down. Thanks. Oh, uh, before I forget, I uh, I brought you an advance copy of my new book as a thank you. Oh, the mystery. I hope you like it. "Deadly By Surprise". Catchy. I just optioned it as a TV movie. I uh... I thought your pen name was Sylvia Donner. Oh, that's only for the romance stuff. I go by Eli Price for everything else. Is everything alright? Yeah. Um, you know what? We should split up, cover more ground. Good idea. I'll go this way. Alright. Detective Carter, I'm on the Matchmaker set with Neil. I think he killed Beatrice. Carl. I got all the way to the garage, forgot my keys. I am so happy to see you. Well, what's wrong? Neil, you don't wanna do this. What gave me away? The cufflink. In Beatrice's room. It had the initials E.P. A gift from a fan. Hadn't realized I lost one. A lot can be overlooked in the heat of the moment. Why did you do it? Beatrice forced my hand. She was gonna tell my wife about our affair. I couldn't let that happen. You and Beatrice? Book tours get lonely. We both regretted it. But Beatrice, she wanted a fresh start with her husband, insisted on coming clean but in order to save her marriage she'd be destroying mine! So you went to her hotel room before the panel. Yeah. I wanted to try and convince her. And when you couldn't you slipped something into her drink? That was a contingency plan, ok? All of this ugliness could have been avoided if she had just listened to reason. You know, I- I could help you. How? Well, your wife. She respects me. I could talk to her. What would you say? Well, relationships can bounce back from hardships, they do all the time. In fact, they just become more battle tested. You really think she'd listen? Yeah. On second thought, I'll tell her to move on. You gonna be alright? Yeah, thanks to you. Stay out of trouble, would ya? Hey, I got a question for you. What would possess you to throw a rack of clothing on to him? I- I thought you wanted me to. You- you gave me a look, like... No, the look I gave you was get the heck out of there. That's an entirely different look. That'd be like... Don't beat yourself up about it but just try to remember for next time? No. No, no. There's not gonna be a next time. How'd you get here so fast? Oh, I was on my way to see you. You were? Mmmhmm. Forensics came back on the cufflink, Neil's wife told me I can find him here. Ah. Well, thank you for the save. You're welcome. Hey, Neil. Found it. Let's go. I can't thank you enough. You really came through for me. I'm just glad justice was served. When you get a minute, swing by the office. I wanna talk to you about writing a book for us. Us? Does this mean you're staying in Evergreen Publishing? A promise is a promise. And it's what my mother would have wanted. Ok, maybe it's what I want, too. That's so great. I guess this means we're neighbours. Yeah. Well... See you around, Angie. Bye. Bye. Oh. Hi. - Hey there, hi. - Come here, come here. What are you doing? - Hey. - Hey. What're you doing here? Oh, I- I was just meeting a friend. Yeah? Small world. Yeah. I didn't know you had a dog. Oh yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you don't know about me. What's her name? Her name is Lucy. Huh, Luce? Hi. That's a pretty name. Thanks. Is there a story behind that? Oh yeah, a very long story. Hmm. So, you uh... Oh. Work. Duty calls. Yeah. Off to save another damsel with a distressing social calendar. Good luck with that. Thanks. Uh, I guess I'll see you around. Thanks. I still owe you that dessert. Yeah, you do. Hey. Go get it!
