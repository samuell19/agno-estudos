Nicoline. - Nicoline, can you hear me ? - Go away, asshole. For your own safety, we're taking you to isolation. Will you cooperate ? She won't cooperate. We're going in. Keep her low. Take her inside, now. Listen, Nicoline. We will leave the cell one by one. Don't get up until the door is closed. Is that clear ? - Yes. Will I be alone then ? - Yes. Thank you, thank you. That went pretty well. - You didn't get hurt, did you ? - No, not at all. But one thing, guys. You all failed for frisking. INSTINCT Thanks. I usually tell new colleagues a bit about the clinic... and the special circumstances here. But that seems a bit redundant given your expertise and track record. -We'd gladly given you a permanent job. - I absolutely don't want one. Because you want to keep giving trainings ? - No, that's also temporary. - But suppose you really like it here. Oh, I'm sure I will. That's not the problem. But ? I just really want... to travel. - Travel ? - Yes. Mountains and such, especially. Don't you have to do something now ? - False alarm. Back inside. - Are you coming ? - Hello. - Hi. - Marieke. - Nicoline. You can leave the door open. - Do you want the door to stay open ? - We always leave it open. - Do you prefer that ? - It's what I'm used to. - But what do you want ? - I want you to feel safe. - Nicoline Marbus. - Idris van Leeuwen. A pleasure. You know I'm taking over Mr Boogers' clients ? - As well as his intern ? - Yes. - How is he ? - Who ? Mr Boogers ? - A burn-out, right ? - Yes. How is he ? If you want me to, I'll make inquiries. Please. Alright. I see you're well on your way in your reintegration leave plan. - Yes. - That's good. - Is it going well ? - Yes, I think so. I... Still escorted, but unescorted has been approved. Unescorted only needs scheduling. - I guess you don't need me anymore. - I'm sure I do. Could you tell me in your own words why you're here ? - My offence, you mean ? - Yes. We do that with offence presentation. But you can tell me now too, can't you ? Repeated sexual offences with an extremely violent character. Or hadn't you gotten that far yet ? That is indeed literally what it says in your file. But that's not what I asked. What I asked was... if you can tell in your own words why you're here. If a friend asked, what would you say ? You're pretty direct. - Do you think so ? - Yes. It's not something you tend to bring up during a... first date. - But I know why you're here. - Yes, but... That's quite different from me telling you about it. - Yes, but that's why I asked. - Next time, okay ? Do you always set the conditions here ? Mom. - It's late, Mom. - Yes. So ? So, I'll stay over. Nice, no ? - But I have to get up really early. - I'll make you breakfast. So you won't forget to eat. Hi ! - Nicoline ? That's your name, right ? - Yes. I saw a dog on the internet that knows CPR. His name is Deril. It's an Italian dog. Nicoline, are you listening ? You can look it up: D-E-R-I-L. Italian dog. Will you look it up ? - Yes. - Yes ? Okay, thanks. Why discuss it if it's already been approved ? I think unescorted leave is absurd. - You don't believe him ? - Not in the least. - Why not ? - He's extremely manipulative. One of the most cooperative patients ever. And he's done a lot of growing, I must say. If you look at where he comes from: violent father, extreme sexual abuse. - I think she's read his file. - So she knows how well he's doing. Yes, that's what he wants you to believe. Sorry, he's been here five years. She walks in and... I've been here two days and he's already been involved in an incident. That fight with the rabbit. But he wasn't involved, right ? - Yes, he was. - He didn't touch anyone. His reaction is what bothers me. What was it ? What did he do ? You can't punish someone for lacking feeling. And he says: 'Don't look at the offences I have committed... but at those I haven't.' - He has a sense of humour. - Dead serious. - It does sound like a joke. - It wasn't a joke. - Come on, he's playing with you. - Maybe I have no sense of humour. Maybe you just have to get to know him. He has a psychopathy score of 30, right ? - Hold on, that test is five years... - It is known to get better with age. -In your sixties, not in your thirties. - Exactly. And you can interpret that differently. In the sense that it occurs less above sixty since most psychopaths don't live that long. Yes, she's got a point there. I find it very strange, unescorted leave. We've been working toward it for years. - Well, let's hope I'm wrong. - Yes, let's hope you are. - Let's talk about John. - Yes, John... - Are you okay ? - Alex, how is John doing ? I understand your doubts, but give it some time with Idris. Everyone is really doing their best. Did you know that there's a dog that knows CPR ? An Italian dog. Deril. But seriously, will you take it easy ? - Jos ? - Yes. - Are you okay, Jos ? - I can take it. - Hey, guys. - No, I can take it. He can take it. - Idris, will you come with me ? - Sure. You wanted to observe. I discussed it with Idris, he's okay with it. Yes, please. Sorry, I cry very fast. Doesn't mean a thing. Leave her alone. - Get lost. Go. - Nothing's the matter. What the fuck are you doing ? They're my friends. Yes, also by helping him a little, with homework and then also with Lego. Helping him build nice things, because he's by himself a lot. And because you develop such a bond, you notice something more begins to grow. Then he said: 'Shall we go upstairs, to the bedroom ?' He suggested that himself. John, why do you think a 10 year old boy would invite someone to his room ? Exactly, I wondered about that as well. It wasn't the first time he did this... Filthy child rapist, I'm going to kill you. Is this yours ? Thanks. Idris, what I'd like to know, what interests me is why you first spend weeks seducing a woman and in the end take her violently after all. - Do I do that ? - You used to. Natasja. What do you think it was like for her ? - How should I know what she thinks ? - That's what I'm asking you. - You tell me. - No, you tell me. I'd like to talk about you. About her or about me ? I asked you a question and I'd like you to answer. - Did I do something wrong ? - No, I'm just asking a question. Marieke, can you go get some coffee ? - Why do you send her away ? - Because you're distracted. - Are you jealous ? - I asked you a question. Sorry, what was it again ? The question was: what do you think it was like for her ? Would you scream ? - Didn't she scream ? - You know I have a dog ? What do you think it was like for her ? I don't know. Now you'll write I lack empathy and I'll never get out of here. Or I say: Terrible, it must have been really terrible for her. What do you want ? Do you want me to be honest or give correct answers ? So you don't know ? Is that your answer ? Then that's what I'll write down. Mum... What's up ? I think you're all so beautiful. That makes me so happy and that makes me cry. But that's no reason to cry, is it ? Do you want something to drink ? - Yes ? - What do you have ? - Good morning ! - Good morning. - The coffee is ready. - Thank you. Isn't it better if I ask for another therapist ? - Why ? - I don't believe that... You and I, it doesn't feel good. - It doesn't feel good ? - No. I don't mind if you turn me over to someone else. - So what is it you feel ? - I don't know, I... I don't know what I provoke in you, but it seems... personal. Interesting. You find me attractive ? Is that it ? It's possible, isn't it ? In that case, just admit it. If that's what's going on here, I should ask for another therapist. Ask ? You choose your own therapist here ? Do you want children ? You think every woman wants to reproduce ? I don't ask every woman, I ask you. How old are you now ? - I'll be on my way. - We can talk about this as adults. - About what ? - That I want another therapist. You won't get another therapist. I'll see you shortly. - I can handle your attractiveness. - Who says I can ? Together, guys, together. Will you come watch next Saturday ? - Do you play as well ? - No, I'm the coach. - Who are they playing against ? - Against themselves. - Are you coming too ? - Yes, they can use the support. Shakil, pass it on. Don't play solo. Yes, together, guys. I would like it if you came to watch. Okay. Hey, take it easy. Look at me. - Come. - Look at me. Take it easy. Hey, look at me. What's this ? Are you dead ? Hey, impatient bunny. Here's my problem. My colleagues are talking exterior leave, but I'm thinking "longstay". How come ? - You're asking me ? - Yes. Do I need to convince you of my rehabilitation ? Does it scare you when I mention "longstay" ? - No, does that worry you ? - Do I look worried ? No, you look tired. I want another therapist, have you discussed this ? Didn't she tell you ? You're not getting another therapist. Well, that's all I need to know, then. He cooperates, is concerned with others The most motivated of the group. When I threaten with "longstay", he doesn't even blink. The only way to get them to cooperate is by teaching them better coping behaviour. - What are you saying ? - He cooperates. What's your problem ? Yes, he talks along with you and says what you want to hear. - Do you threaten him with "longstay" ? - Just to check his reaction. But don't worry, it makes no impression. Guys, I believe we have to stop. I know it's all been approved already, but I'm against it. Okay, we'll talk again soon. Nothing to be done. - Why do you doubt him so much ? - I always have doubts. Not about him, though. Do you ever feel you have real contact with him ? Yes, I do. - But what is 'real contact' ? - I mean that... Yes, I do feel I get through to him. You think too complicated. There's not all that much behind what he says and does. The guy isn't that complex. Ask him about his dreams, for example. Not just about his fears, as he doesn't have any. Ask him something very ordinary. Ask about his dog. Do you want to go out for dinner ? I can't make it tonight. Okay. - I really can't. - I didn't say anything. Never sleep with a colleague. How else is she supposed to meet someone ? Do you really like him ? You really have to open up. She always so picky. Yes, Paula. I'm doing my best. - I'm tired. - Take a bath. - Here ? - Yes. I know you want to... Oh, that's really great. - It's stuck. - Oh, nice... Yes, there... - God, it's really stuck, no ? - Yes. Nicoline ! - That's not really tasty. - Not tasty ? Are you kidding me ? Marieke, Alex needs you. Outside. I have a son. Not. No ? No. - Your file makes no mention of it. - I have a picture. You want to see it? Why are you telling me this now ? You look so sad. I don't have much to offer, but I wanted to give you something. Women like that, right ? When you open up ? Are women that simple ? Women have more rape fantasies than men. You have to watch out, you. - What's your son's name ? - Milan. - Milan ? - Yes. He works at... Yes, that's funny, he works, not at McDonald's, but the other one... that thing with those chickens... Can I help you ? Yes, I... - What do you suggest ? - We sell chicken. - Okay. - A bucket ? A bucket ? Yes, a bucket. One ? - Two. - Two ? Okay. How much is that ? 31.90 euros. Here you go. - Enjoy. - Thanks. Have a nice evening. Hi, Alex ! I'll see you tomorrow. Nice ! What did you say ? Good game. Well done. - I almost scored. - I saw that. Excellent, Jos. But next time wear sneakers, not slippers. This is dangerous. I'll get them, I'll go get my shoes. - Hey, good coaching. - Thanks. That goal of mine was a legitimate goal. Why was it denied ? Because you double dribbled. When you... - I'll see you at the car. - I'll be right there.. When you're dribbling and stop... But everyone does that, not just me. You shouldn't wear lipstick. It's unprofessional and unbecoming. And you don't need it. I have a question. Do you have a wife ? - Why do you want to know ? - I think I can give you some advice. - Give me advice ? - The thing is, you're too nice. Yes, you should watch that. Hey, coach. - What was that just now ? - What ? What's going on between you and Idris ? Why ? - Did he threaten you ? - No, what makes you say that ? - Intuition. - No. Do you like sushi ? - If I can help you, just tell me. - What do you mean ? I know Idris. I've known that guy much longer than you. And I know he likes to intimidate. Especially women. That's nothing to be ashamed about or deny. - Is that what happened ? - Do I look intimidated ? I think you do, yes. Your reaction is very defensive. - You don't even answer me. - You're projecting. - Did he threaten you ? - No. You know you can tell me everything. I'm here to help you. What ? - You're here to help me ? - You think that's funny ? Yes. You don't have to help me. I can handle this work fine by myself. So if you want to play the protective man, find someone else, I'm not into that type. I don't feel like having such evasive non-conversations. Gea ? Fun afternoon, wasn't it ? Will you play next time ? Remember you said I should take it easy ? Yes, I meant to talk to you about that. - I shouldn't have said that. - But you were totally right. No, between you and me. The man you replaced was not very bright. I was so glad you took over Idris. I may not be the right therapist for him. It's positive to have differences of opinion, that we don't always agree. That makes for a range of viewpoints, different ideas. Really, have faith in it. You're doing a great job. Hey, enjoy the weekend. Make the most of it. Really, go out and get some sun. - Hi ! - Hey ! Read this to me. Now ? - Yes, out loud, please. Idris. Oral and anal penetration. Victim broken pelvis. Mainly due to increase of offences in gravity and frequency. And the age of the last victim... - Do you think I'm too young ? - For whom ? Do you want to do the session with Idris today ? Seriously ? - Yes. - Okay. Okay. Hi ! So you have four hours leave. Any idea as to what you want to do ? You can't go too far. Do you have a plan ? - Yes. - What is it ? I want to see the sea. Can you make it there and back in four hours ? - Yes. - Okay. - Do you know how to get there ? - Yes, by bus. You get off at the stop near that hotel. Then across the large parking lot... till you reach the staircase to the boardwalk. Just say 'I'. Make it personal. Oh, right. Of course. I go down to the boardwalk and then you have to pass under this building... Who ? I have to pass under this building. Then you come to the sushi bar, where there are two white benches. - It doesn't have to be so detailed. - Okay. - And there I walk out onto the beach. - Okay. And what do you expect from it ? Do you know which spot I mean ? Sorry. I know what you want, but that's not going to happen. I have a train to catch. You don't need to be afraid. Gee, stay with me a bit longer. Okay. It's really time to get you another therapist. I understand that you don't like it, but it really is better. Because when you... Idris ? Idris ? Are you okay ? Are you okay ? Idris. You're right. It's time I get another therapist. False alarm. - Sure ? - Yes, nothing the matter. Gea ? Did you know that he has a son ? - What ? - Yes, it doesn't say so in his file. But the file isn't everything. Everyone can have something of his own, right ? He works at McDonald's. - Who ? - His son. Kentucky Fried Chicken. No, McDonald's, the big one at the pool. I went there to take a look once. Silly, isn't it ? Just out of curiosity. Bye. - Where did you get my address ? - I have two hours leave. - You shouldn't let me in, though. - No, I'm not going to. - You have to leave now. - Yes, I know. I know. You won't send me away. - You won't send me away now, right ? - I really want you to go. And I really know that's not true. And now ? What did you think would happen now ? Coffee, perhaps ? - I assume you won't do anything to me. - You should never assume that. Otherwise the thrill is gone, right ? Just kidding. Just kidding. I want it to start normal between us. I'll be getting out soon. We'll go out, together. We'll go to the movies together, do other fun things. Go on outings together. Go out for dinner, date. Just normal things. That's impossible. That really is impossible. And I really understand that you think... I'm sorry, but if you got the feeling that I might... That's not the case. I don't want this, I really don't want this. You have to meet my son. - You don't have a son. - What are you doing ? Come on, sit down. - How old is your son ? - Sixteen. - Fourteen. - You don't know. What's your password ? - Why ? - I have to check when the bus leaves. Shall I look it up for you ? Sit down. Just sit down and relax, you're making me nervous. Sit down. Are you expecting someone ? No. An old lady in a purple coat. That's my mother. Everyone can look straight inside. - Idris, you have to go back now. - Yes, in a minute. Promise me you'll do something about this. Do you know that man ? Who ? Your neighbour across the street. Sorry, I get jealous quickly, I have to work on that. You act strange. You don't want to go to the movies with me. Are you afraid now ? Yes, I'm afraid of you. Do you think I like that you're afraid of me ? Why do you come to my house ? Why do you leave your planner lying around ? I didn't do that. Isn't it nice like this, cosily at home ? - I really want you to go now. - You don't believe that yourself. What I say makes no difference anyway. - But you let me in yourself. - No, I didn't, you let yourself in. You could have shut the door, but you didn't want to. I gave you every chance. - But I didn't ask you in. - I won't tell anyone, really. Jesus, bitch, just sit down ! Sorry. Does it matter to you if I resist or not ? Do you really think I'm different from other men ? Do you think that Peeping Tom has other fantasies than me ? - Is that nice ? - No, let go of me. - Now say it as if you mean it. - Let go of me. Oh sweetheart, oh sweetheart. - I want you to let go of me now. - Oh sweetheart ! Look, you can still go back. Nothing's happened yet. And how will you explain it ? That you abused your position of power ? As your patient I'm in a dependent position. - What ? I make abuse of you ? - It doesn't matter. Take it easy. Nicoline, stop, stop. Stop. I know what love is. And you ? Yes ? Okay. - Come, let's lie down. - No, no... - Lie down. - No. Goddam ! Did I frighten you ? Sorry, I can get a bit dominant. I thought you could take that. Will you tell me if I go too far ? Will you tell me if I go too far ? Don't put your hair behind your ears, it's ugly. I love you. I have to go. We don't want any problems, right ? Will I see you later at the clinic ? Yes ? Never forget that you're a very strong woman. - We have no appointment now, do we ? - No. What are you doing ? Idris, let go. Let go. Get him out of here. You love me. INSTINCT
