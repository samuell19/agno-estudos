That was quick. ﻿Quick? It took me over an hour. ﻿I'm the slow one then. ﻿The fennel wasn't fresh, so I bought chives instead. ﻿We'll have to add an egg then. ﻿Is the G3 bag template ready yet? ﻿You're still threading the needle? ﻿Didn't I thread the needles for you before I went out? ﻿I've used them all. ﻿Here you go. ﻿I threaded two needles for you. ﻿The thread came out. ﻿It looks finished to me. ﻿Pass it over. - ﻿You're putting that here now? - ﻿Yes. ﻿We haven't moved the table yet. ﻿Look at all this space you have to work on. ﻿Look. This side is against the wall. ﻿There is a lamp on this side. ﻿The vice takes up two sides. ﻿There isn't any space left. ﻿Ok. - ﻿Come over here. - ﻿Ok. ﻿Heave. ﻿Turn it this way. ﻿Turn it which way? - ﻿Clockwise. - ﻿I see. ﻿One, two, three. Heave. ﻿Don't push against me. One, two, three. - ﻿This way. - ﻿Ok. ﻿One, two, three. ﻿Ok. I'll do it. - ﻿Huifen. - ﻿Yes? ﻿Fetch me some water. ﻿How much? ﻿Enough to mix three cups of flour. ﻿Hot or cold? ﻿Warm water will do. ﻿Take the flour out. - ﻿Look. - ﻿That's too much. ﻿A little more. A little more. ﻿Ok, that's just about right. ﻿It's the end of the month, ﻿but still no news ﻿from the management of the shopping centre. ﻿When did they send the contract last year? ﻿I think we had finished all the paperwork ﻿by the start of the month. ﻿Don't worry. ﻿They might have already given the contract ﻿to the sales assistant. ﻿I wouldn't bet on it. ﻿The cost of the rent is written in the contract. ﻿The management charges each shop a different rent. ﻿So if the sales assistant gets to know how much the rent is, ﻿it'll put management in an awkward position. ﻿If what you say is right, ﻿whatever gets given to the salesperson must be bad news. ﻿Exactly. ﻿I can't say for sure. ﻿But there is a much bigger chance it will be bad news. ﻿We haven't got any news yet. ﻿The meat is in the fridge. At the top. ﻿Found it. ﻿If I were you, I would stop fussing about it. ﻿Just go to management and ask. ﻿The earlier we know what's going on, ﻿the earlier we can make plans. ﻿Are you afraid to ask? ﻿Empty the water out. ﻿We can use the bowl for the filling. ﻿Where shall I put it? ﻿Put it here. ﻿Oh, you've moved the table over here. ﻿A certain someone has left some space for you to work. ﻿Why is the meat so fatty? ﻿The fat doubles as oil. ﻿Heavens. - ﻿I might as well just give it to you. - ﻿Ok. ﻿How should I chop the chives? ﻿Each bit should be the same length as the width of the leaf. ﻿How can you use chives as a reference ﻿for chopping chives? ﻿You've got a point. ﻿The bits should be square-shaped. ﻿So, how long then? - ﻿Four millimetres long. - ﻿Ok. ﻿Let me get past. ﻿You can rest for a while. ﻿All yours. ﻿How long should I chop them? ﻿They should be as long as the width of the leaves. ﻿How long is that? ﻿Four millimetres. ﻿Four millimetres. ﻿It doesn't have to be exactly that length. ﻿You said four millimetres. ﻿Your hand should be straight. Press down hard. ﻿Bend your fingers slightly. ﻿Alright. Alright. ﻿This is impossible. ﻿That's the problem with chives. ﻿Try chopping a smaller bunch. ﻿I'll straighten them up. ﻿See? No difference. ﻿When I push the knife down, ﻿the ones on the edge don't get cut. ﻿Take these. Take your time. ﻿At that speed, it'll be dark before we get any dinner. ﻿Do you think it's too hard? ﻿Yes. A little. ﻿I'll leave it to sit then. ﻿Move over a little. ﻿Come over this way. ﻿Give those to me. ﻿Leave them there. ﻿Put this back. ﻿Let me get past. ﻿Pass that lighter over. ﻿It's on the table next to the kettle. ﻿Which one? ﻿The small one. - ﻿Huifen? - ﻿Yes? ﻿You'll have to hold the wok for me. ﻿Hang on. Let me do this first. ﻿Careful. ﻿It's alright. Let remove this first. ﻿Ok. ﻿Put this back for me. ﻿That wok is really dirty. ﻿Take your glasses off. ﻿The flame is too high. ﻿Did it burn? ﻿No. It's sticking a bit. ﻿It's alright, I'll scrape it off. ﻿I didn't smell anything burning. ﻿Where's my ruler? ﻿I can't see anything without my glasses. ﻿Have you finished chopping yet? ﻿They might be a bit longer than four millimetres. ﻿Let me do it. ﻿What are you doing? I'll... ﻿You'll do it? ﻿Of course. I may be slow, but I'll get it done eventually. ﻿Take your time then. ﻿Pass the cloth over. ﻿I'll do that. ﻿Why is it so bland? ﻿Whoops, I forgot to add salt. ﻿I've finished chopping. ﻿Go and wash your hands then. ﻿Ok. ﻿You've missed a bit. ﻿They won't get rid of me that easily. ﻿What I'm running is a specialist shop. ﻿Firstly, I design everything myself. ﻿Secondly, it is all hand-made. ﻿Thirdly, it's the only one of its kind. ﻿Shops like that are the future. ﻿Yeah, right! ﻿Every year you tell management how wonderful you are. ﻿What have you got to brag about this year? ﻿I'm not boasting. ﻿I tell them every year I'm going to refurbish the place. ﻿But you two never support me. ﻿You have to earn enough money ﻿before you can refurbish anything. ﻿You're always talking about refurbishing. ﻿How will refurbish the place make any difference? ﻿This "specialist shop" you're talking about... ﻿Where's the cloth? ﻿Here. ﻿I think it is a specialist shop. ﻿Who says so? ﻿What is the point in calling it a specialist shop yourself? ﻿Every time business is good, ﻿it's always because we are selling at discount prices. ﻿You can brag all you like, ﻿but there's no point ﻿unless the customers recognize the value of your bags. ﻿If you ask me, ﻿those who buy are worse than the ones who don't. - ﻿Beibei. - ﻿Yes? ﻿Go and fetch me some sesame oil. ﻿Ok. ﻿Where is the sesame oil? ﻿Is that all? ﻿Yes. We can save it for next time. ﻿It doesn't smell of much now. ﻿It'll taste great once cooked. ﻿Stir it a little more gently. ﻿What? ﻿The water will seep out. ﻿The chopsticks should be touching the bottom of the bowl. ﻿Then stir. ﻿I can't do this. ﻿Never mind. Leave it. ﻿Shall I put the salt back? ﻿Put this back while you're at it. ﻿Hang on. Let me have a go. ﻿Do you have to pull your sleeves up for this? ﻿It has to be done very quickly, doesn't it? ﻿You have to put flour on it. Have a go. ﻿Let me put some water on my hands. ﻿Do you have to take it so seriously? ﻿Did it stick? ﻿Yes. It's flat. ﻿Not too bad. ﻿One, two, three. ﻿Look. ﻿Can I still pull it off like this? ﻿Of course, carry on. ﻿Look. Try it. ﻿Why can't we just use a knife? ﻿This is how we make dumplings in this house. ﻿You have to cup your hand slightly. ﻿You should pull it off up here. ﻿You're pulling it off down here. ﻿That's how I was doing it. ﻿Never mind. Hang on. ﻿I'll mould it back together and we can try again. - ﻿Will it still be edible? - Of ﻿course. ﻿This is good stuff, it'll be fine. See? ﻿You have to add quite a lot of flour or it will stick. ﻿Watch my hand. ﻿Watch me. ﻿Make a hole. ﻿Then stretch it into a circular shape. ﻿Then turn. ﻿I can do that. ﻿Can you? You try then. Keep it even. ﻿It's too difficult for her. ﻿She wants to learn. ﻿Both hands at the same time. ﻿Press down harder on the thicker parts. ﻿Both hands at the same time. ﻿Press harder on the thicker bits ﻿and press gently on the thinner bits. ﻿That's it. ﻿It's just like a snake. ﻿That's it. Stretch it out. ﻿That's enough. Add a bit of flour. ﻿Sprinkle it on. ﻿This is the most important part. See? ﻿You always use this part ﻿instead of the part where the finger goes in. ﻿You make it look very complicated. ﻿Here, let me show you. ﻿I'll remove that for you. ﻿How come you're using your left hand? ﻿Never noticed that before. ﻿I always do it like this. ﻿Did you see that? ﻿You're right. ﻿Do you use your left or your right hand? ﻿I use my right hand, of course. ﻿We both use our right hand. ﻿Your mum uses her left. That's unusual. ﻿How did you twist it? Like this? Here. ﻿Your thumbs should rub against each other like a knife. I told her to use this part. ﻿I don't know which is correct either. ﻿That won't do. You'd better start again. ﻿We can't use this bit. We can do that bit later. ﻿It's worse than the first time. ﻿That won't do. Start again. ﻿Let me show you. ﻿Let's get rid of this bit. I'll put it here. ﻿Never mind. ﻿Listen to that. Quiet for a moment. Listen. ﻿All I can hear is the sound of the train. ﻿When mum does it, there's a sound. ﻿Did you hear it? ﻿She's better than you at it. ﻿Your poor skills have rubbed off on me now. ﻿That's not the right sound. ﻿You made it on purpose. ﻿Let me finish them off. ﻿Listen to that. ﻿Not bad at all. ﻿There's a sound as she pulls it off. ﻿I wouldn't have noticed if you hadn't told me. ﻿Your mum used her left hand. ﻿I do it like this all the time. ﻿I can't do that. If I... ﻿This part of your hand acts like a knife. ﻿There. I've finished. ﻿Right. ﻿I'll sprinkle a bit more flour on. ﻿Our preparations have turned into ﻿a dumpling training course. ﻿Don't copy the way your mum does it. ﻿What's wrong with my method? ﻿See how you do it? ﻿I use both hands. ﻿Never seen anything like it. ﻿The top and bottom stick out just like a flying saucer. ﻿Watch me. ﻿Once you've pulled it off you've got a roundish shape. ﻿Both ends will stick to your palm easily. ﻿So add a little flour to both ends. ﻿Then, do this. ﻿I'll tell you why it works. ﻿The board is flat. Your palm is slightly concave, right? ﻿So you just press down hard and turn. ﻿Perfect! ﻿It's flat. ﻿Your dad's method is better. ﻿I'll do the rest. ﻿An expert would use both hands. ﻿Both hands at the same time... ﻿I doubt if you can do that. ﻿You have to remove everything else first. ﻿See, one is bigger than the other. ﻿The table is too high. ﻿It's the table for me. ﻿Step on the beam. ﻿Don't press down hard until your hand turns. ﻿You have to add flour. ﻿Not bad. ﻿This is easier than breaking off the bits of dough. ﻿This one is small, this one big. ﻿Take a bit of the big one and stick it on to the smaller one. ﻿But don't do it like that. ﻿The dough has sat for a while, so it's malleable. ﻿Otherwise, it would dry up quickly ﻿and the dumplings would break. ﻿Spread your palm. Gently now. ﻿There are still a few left. ﻿Finish them off. Hurry up. ﻿It doesn't matter if there's a dent in it, does it? ﻿Press down on the dented part. ﻿That's it. ﻿The last ones are a bit big. ﻿The size doesn't really matter. ﻿As long as they are even. ﻿You can press harder on the smaller ones ﻿and less on the bigger ones. ﻿The rule is that the wrapper should be thicker in the middle ﻿and thinner on the edges. ﻿If the wrapper is too thick, it will break easily. ﻿I remember you saying that before. ﻿The filling looks good. ﻿I can't really reach it over there. ﻿Just put it there, then. ﻿Not bad, eh? - ﻿Not bad. - ﻿Not bad. ﻿You're doing a good job, Beibei. ﻿But you're lagging behind. ﻿Let me take over. ﻿One person rolled the dough. Two make the dumpling. ﻿We'll never get it done like this. ﻿Ok. Hang on. Let me finish this one. ﻿Quality comes first. ﻿I'll go over to that side, then. ﻿Look at me. ﻿I'm putting mine over there instead of on my dumping mat. ﻿It looks as if you've made lots ﻿and I haven't made even one. ﻿It's a question of habit. ﻿Shall I just place them like this? ﻿Anyway you like, ﻿as long as they are not stuck together. ﻿This one's no good. ﻿I'll use a smaller one. ﻿If you ask me, ﻿we have to place the dumpling on the mat ﻿at a ninety-degree angle. ﻿True. They should be placed vertically. ﻿That is how they are now. ﻿No one likes using the chopsticks. ﻿Yeah. ﻿I like using chopsticks. ﻿I was always told to use a piece of bamboo. ﻿That has one larger side and one smaller side. That is the traditional kind. ﻿That's right. ﻿Do people still use them? ﻿No. ﻿I think using chopsticks is easier. ﻿But it's not easy scooping the filling. ﻿If your hands are slightly cupped ﻿it's easier to put the filling on, ﻿because the bottom is concave. ﻿How come you're putting on so much filling? ﻿This is not a lot. ﻿Your mum doesn't like them with too much filling, ﻿so I always put less. ﻿Beibei's look a bit different to ours. ﻿Don't put too much filling in. ﻿This one's not bad. ﻿Watch how I do it. ﻿Give me some flour. ﻿Watch me. ﻿Start from the middle and pinch it together. ﻿Three times. ﻿Then a fourth, ﻿a fifth and you've got your dumpling. ﻿I don't think I follow. ﻿I'll show you again. ﻿There's only one left. ﻿One's enough. ﻿Don't put too much filling in. ﻿I don't like too much filling in mine. See, ﻿if you use chopsticks you get bits all over the place. ﻿If you get filling on the edges, ﻿as soon as you boil it, it will break. ﻿Because of the oil. ﻿That's right. ﻿Let's concentrate on this, shall we? ﻿Pinch once, twice, and again. ﻿Use your thumbs to pinch the edges together ﻿and you'll get a crease like this. ﻿Every dumpling should look like this one. ﻿By pinching it, you get a fold. ﻿Looks slightly hunchbacked. ﻿We don't have any more wrappers. I'd better hurry up. ﻿And you said I was slow. ﻿Yes. I have been watching your mum all along. ﻿Can you tell which ones you made? ﻿I certainly can. ﻿This one is definitely mine. ﻿So is this one. ﻿This one's yours. See? ﻿It's flat. ﻿Your mum's dumplings have decorative edges. ﻿Why are you always so contrary? ﻿Look. It's curved. ﻿Your dumplings are straight. I ﻿can make them like that. ﻿I'll try one in a bit. ﻿Now I'm going to... ﻿Let's put them in line. ﻿This is my line. ﻿That's definitely yours. ﻿This is your line. ﻿This one's mine. ﻿Why do you always have to be so contrary? ﻿I don't do it consciously. ﻿You use your left hand to pull the bits of dough off. ﻿Everyone else stirs the filling clockwise, ﻿but you do it anti-clockwise. ﻿I don't realize it myself. It's just a habit. ﻿There can only be one reason for it. ﻿Your blood type is B. ﻿Let's turn this one around. ﻿I really can't make them like that. ﻿I've made a mess of it. ﻿I'll have to mend this one for you. ﻿The chives are seeping out of the crack. ﻿See, it's got an edge. ﻿It's just not very pretty, that's all. ﻿It's just not as standard as mine. ﻿You'll get the hang of it. ﻿Look. ﻿This is how I do it. ﻿I press the edges together like this. ﻿Your dad likes to press it in one go. ﻿I'll put my dumplings on another tray. ﻿You can make your own line too. ﻿See. It's straight, isn't it? ﻿In one go. ﻿My hands are small. I doubt if I can do that. ﻿Your dad likes to press it together. ﻿I prefer to pinch the edges together. ﻿By pinching the edges, you can push all the bad luck in. ﻿If you ask me, ﻿it doesn't matter how much I pinch. ﻿I won't manage to stop the bad luck from seeping out. ﻿You could once see the train from here. ﻿Let me have a look. ﻿It's a bit crowded on this side. ﻿I'll go over there. ﻿You can put them on there too, if you like. ﻿I still can't make them the way mum does. ﻿It's not something you can learn in one day. ﻿There are still some broken ones. ﻿Where? ﻿So it is. ﻿That can't be one of mine. ﻿I told you to be careful. ﻿Of course it is yours. ﻿That is definitely not one of mine. ﻿Look. ﻿This is the one I just made. ﻿They are totally different. ﻿There's a broken one? ﻿This is definitely not one of mine. ﻿This one has a thicker edge. ﻿It must be your dad's. ﻿One of the pressed ones. ﻿Only your dad's look like that. ﻿See if you can fix it. ﻿It seems everyone has their own way of making dumplings. ﻿Every person has his own method. ﻿A person's appearance is a product of their personality. ﻿It's the same with dumplings. ﻿Sounds very philosophical to me. ﻿Look. ﻿Look at this one. ﻿It's standing. ﻿Now look at this one. It's not mine. ﻿It's lying on its side. ﻿Look at mine. ﻿How on earth was this one made? Pressed or pinched? ﻿I... I... I... pinched the edges together first, ﻿then pressed it. ﻿Or pressed it first, and then pinched. ﻿If I have to define it, ﻿I would say it is... ﻿what's the word... a happy medium? ﻿It's freestyle. ﻿It's contemporary art, if you ask me. ﻿Your ends are no thinner than mine. ﻿That is definitely not mine. ﻿The first ones you made, you put here. ﻿But you put some of yours over here. ﻿I bet that one is yours. ﻿Putting in a lot of filling is a sign of greed. ﻿Someone who always wants more. ﻿What about the ones with less filling? ﻿Is that a sign of stinginess? ﻿Are you talking about me? ﻿That's not what I meant. ﻿Look at this dumpling I just made. ﻿Look, doesn't it look like me? ﻿This one doesn't look like you. ﻿You don't think so? ﻿No. If you ask me, this one looks more like you. ﻿This one's really ugly. ﻿I want to discuss something with you. But don't fret. ﻿Ok. ﻿What if management doesn't renew the contract? ﻿How should I explain the situation to everyone? ﻿It's not a "what if" question. It's almost a given. ﻿Just tell them the contract came to an end. ﻿I don't think that will do. ﻿A contract can always be renewed. ﻿The rent is too high. ﻿Can't say that either. They will know that the business is bad. ﻿And you think business is good? ﻿You know dad's proud. ﻿Can't you just find him a good excuse ﻿and let him save face? ﻿Ok. ﻿Just tell people we don't want to do it anymore. ﻿That we've had enough. ﻿But do want to continue. ﻿All you care about is your pride. ﻿The real problem is Diao Xiaoli. ﻿If she finds out we've closed the shop, ﻿she won't give you any rest. ﻿If she makes a fuss, ﻿I'll put her in her place. ﻿You would be better focusing all that energy ﻿on making money. ﻿From that point of view, ﻿it would be better to keep the shop. ﻿Better my foot! ﻿For the past seven years, ﻿we've spent tens of thousands on rent. ﻿That's not including the workers' salaries ﻿and the shop assistants' salaries. ﻿Then there's the cost of the leather. ﻿You know how anxious I get when it's time to pay the rent. ﻿For seven years. ﻿If you are worried about Diao Xiaoli, ﻿you can simply tell her that ﻿we want to expand the business ﻿and that the shop is too small. ﻿She is a moneygrubber. ﻿If she hears you're going into big business, ﻿she'll want to invest in it. ﻿That would be a big trouble. ﻿Who cares? ﻿If she's willing to invest, then let her. ﻿We are not that kind of people. ﻿I suppose we've finished. ﻿Time to boil them. ﻿Almost there. ﻿Go and fetch some garlic. ﻿Ok. ﻿Do you think this one looks like me? ﻿Maodou just bit me. ﻿Are you ok? I'm fine. ﻿I got a fright, that's all. ﻿It was just a little bite. ﻿That cat! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿We're going to cook the dumplings, aren't we? ﻿Don't put the wok up here. Leave it down there. ﻿You know she thinks it's dirty. ﻿Oh. ﻿Give that a wash. ﻿Ok. - ﻿Beibei. - ﻿Yes? ﻿Fetch me a stool. ﻿Beibei. ﻿Fetch me a lighter and a piece of paper. ﻿Will newspaper do? ﻿Yes. Just a small piece. - ﻿Just a small piece, right? - ﻿Yes. ﻿Is this big enough? ﻿That's fine. ﻿Easy now. ﻿Let me do it. ﻿Let go. It's fine. - ﻿Is it ok? - ﻿Fine. ﻿Beibei. ﻿Yes? ﻿Watch the stove for me. - ﻿Call me when the water is boiling. - ﻿Ok. ﻿I'll make the remaining dumplings. ﻿I'll put this here. ﻿Ok. ﻿There are only a few dumplings left to make. ﻿I'll do them. ﻿There aren't that many left. ﻿I'll make the wrappers. You can put the filling in. ﻿There's not much filling left either. ﻿It's enough. ﻿What are you going to say to your staff? ﻿Nothing to it, really. The problem is their age and their qualifications. ﻿They can do an ok job with us. ﻿But they'll find it difficult to get a job elsewhere. ﻿I suppose you can talk to them over a meal. ﻿Enough filling for the dough we have. ﻿Yeah. Not bad at all. ﻿That's the last one. ﻿All finished. ﻿Well? ﻿It's not boiling yet. ﻿Huifen, did you get the bowl? ﻿Yes. I'll clear up these things first... ﻿Let your mum get past. I'll pass it over to you in a minute. ﻿Almost there. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Looks like it's boiling. ﻿Not quite. ﻿We'll have to wait a little longer. ﻿The fire is big enough, isn't it? ﻿Yes. ﻿It must have boiled by now. ﻿A watched kettle never boils. ﻿The more you wait, the longer it takes. ﻿Maybe you should pretend you're not waiting. ﻿The more you wait, the longer it takes. ﻿As soon as you forget about it, it'll start to boil. ﻿There we are. It's boiling. ﻿Let me do it. ﻿Careful now. ﻿Easy does it. ﻿Pass me that wooden spoon. ﻿Don't put them in one by one. ﻿Put them in pairs. ﻿Gently pick them up like this. ﻿Hold them close to the water, otherwise they will splash. ﻿Try again. ﻿Closer to the water. ﻿It's too hot. ﻿You're still holding them too far away. ﻿Drop them in in pairs. ﻿I'll hold it for you. ﻿Closer. ﻿There's so much steam. ﻿Of course there is. ﻿No, you've got it wrong. ﻿So how are you supposed to do it then? ﻿You have to slide along the surface of the wok. ﻿Faster. It should be touching the wok. ﻿Push the water. ﻿Don't pull it back like that. ﻿I'll show you. ﻿I'll do it. ﻿Push the water away. ﻿Am I doing it right now? ﻿Not too bad. ﻿You shouldn't be pushing the dumplings. ﻿You want to push the water. ﻿The water will then move the dumplings. ﻿Don't stir it. - ﻿See the water moving around? - ﻿Yes. ﻿The water pushes the dumplings around. ﻿If you don't do this, they'll stick to the wok and break. ﻿Last two. - ﻿There are more. - ﻿Oh, yes. That's right. ﻿We've finished this one. ﻿Hang on. ﻿I'll pass them over. ﻿Stay where you are. ﻿Steady now. ﻿I'm going to put them in, ok? ﻿Go ahead. ﻿I didn't count how many there are. ﻿I did. Altogether there are fifty-nine. ﻿Fifty-nine. ﻿Fifty-nine... ﻿But that's not counting the last fourteen. ﻿Fifty-nine plus fourteen. Seventy-three? ﻿Fifty-nine plus fourteen. ﻿Is that seventy-three? ﻿Huifen, ﻿how much is fifty-nine plus fourteen? ﻿Seventy-three. ﻿That's right. ﻿This is the last one. ﻿Give that to me. ﻿Seventy-three dumplings for three people. ﻿Divide that by three. ﻿What did you say? ﻿Seventy-three dumplings for three people. ﻿If we divide the total by three, that makes twenty-five. ﻿I can't eat that many. ﻿Pass that bowl over. ﻿I'm going to add some water. ﻿That yellow bowl. ﻿Ok. ﻿Do you still want this garlic? ﻿Yes. Just in case there isn't enough. ﻿Did you bring in the vinegar? ﻿Yes. ﻿There's rice vinegar and Laba vinegar. ﻿Be patient. ﻿They'll be ready in a minute. ﻿There seems to be too little water and too many dumplings. ﻿In that case... ﻿I'll put some more water in. ﻿I'll fetch some more. ﻿Beibei. ﻿Yes? ﻿When you make dumplings, ﻿you need to add water to keep the heat down. ﻿There's a saying. ﻿Lid on to cook the wrapper, ﻿lid off to cook the filling. ﻿Lid on to cook the wrapper. ﻿Lid off to cook the filling. ﻿Why is that? ﻿Can I put this here? ﻿Ok. ﻿There's no particular reason. ﻿That's what we were taught when we were young. ﻿Are we cooking the wrappers now? ﻿Right. ﻿Lid off to cook the filling. ﻿If we don't cook the filling, the meat will be raw. ﻿So you have to add water. ﻿Looks like much more than seventy. ﻿Hold this for me. ﻿Don't get burnt. ﻿Ouch! ﻿Let me hold it. ﻿Are you taking it away? ﻿No. ﻿We might still need it. ﻿Do you still need the lid? ﻿No. ﻿Pass the straining ladle over to your dad. ﻿Yes. I need the straining ladle. ﻿You have to put them through water. ﻿Otherwise, they'll stick to the plate. ﻿Let's put it on the floor. ﻿Easy now. ﻿Do you have enough plates? ﻿Not really. ﻿Fetch another one. ﻿Can we fit anymore on this one? - ﻿I'll put it up there. - ﻿Ok. ﻿You really have got a nasty cough. ﻿I'll get your mum to give you some medicine. ﻿Stand up. I'll get it. ﻿It's probably from the gas. ﻿We should get her some medicine. ﻿Yeah. ﻿There are only a few left. ﻿Is that all of them? ﻿Actually, we should bring the lid back in. ﻿Otherwise, the soup will get cold. ﻿Ok. ﻿Beibei. Bring a stool in, will you? ﻿There isn't much garlic in this. ﻿I've peeled it all. ﻿We can put it in later. ﻿I'll have some of that, too. ﻿Here you go. ﻿Want some garlic? ﻿It's not easy to fish it out with chopsticks. ﻿Use a spoon. ﻿Slow down or you'll break the jar. ﻿Do you want any? ﻿You help yourself. ﻿Pass me the spoon. ﻿I'll have a bit more of that. ﻿Are you serving the soup? ﻿Yes. ﻿Careful. It's hot. ﻿Half a bowl is enough for me. ﻿There's a mosquito. ﻿Up there. ﻿Don't move. ﻿Careful. ﻿Are you ok? ﻿We're fine. Just leave it. I ﻿didn't catch it. ﻿It flew over there. ﻿As long as it's not in here. ﻿You're a really slow eater. Look at my plate. ﻿Maoji has arrived. ﻿She's always around when there's food. ﻿Where's her little dish? ﻿I'll get it. ﻿Jiji. Here you are. ﻿Is she eating? ﻿Leave her. ﻿Are they too salty? ﻿Just right. They're really good. ﻿If we had put all the fatty meat in as you wanted to, ﻿I bet they would taste very different. ﻿You did put the fatty bits in. ﻿They taste better with both fatty and lean bits. ﻿I've finished. ﻿I can have some more later if I'm hungry. ﻿Look at all these leftover dumplings. ﻿I'll eat them in a minute. ﻿Who's on duty today at the shop? ﻿The new one. ﻿What's she like? ﻿She's not a bad saleswoman. ﻿She's very reliable. ﻿But if we do close the shop, ﻿it will be difficult for her to find work. ﻿Is it because she's overweight? ﻿Yeah. ﻿I bet the skinny one can find a job easily. ﻿Yes. She is smart. ﻿Get me some more soup. ﻿Honestly, she's left all that garlic! ﻿Half a bowl is enough. - ﻿Are you having anymore? - ﻿No. ﻿There's one here. ﻿You have those. ﻿I've had enough. ﻿Have a little more. ﻿Huifen. ﻿I won't go to the shop this evening. ﻿I'm not in the mood. ﻿Let's go out for a walk, then. Ok. ﻿Don't forget to take some cat food. ﻿I wonder if we will see that tortoiseshell cat again. ﻿You mean that little cat? ﻿Where did we see her yesterday? ﻿Behind the coal shop.
