Please note that this news is made based on strict fairness June 25th, 1950. With the sudden invasion of the North, South Korea was instantly pushed to the southern part of Nakdonggan River, faced with the imminent threat of losing the war, However, with the participation of the ally, US Army, and it was expected that the war would come to an end soon. However, with the participation of a massive Chinese Communist Army the fate of the war became a mystery. In fact, the Korean War turns into a war between two great powers. In the process, around 140,000 prisoners of war from the Northern China came about. And a massive scale POW camp was made in Koje Island, the southernmost part of the peninsula to isolate the prisoners. Under the Geneva Convention that puts POW's human rights on the 4th run, POWs were guaranteed free time, such as vocational education and leisure time, receiving better treatment than South Korean civilians and soldiers at the time. During the process, a great number of free repatriates rise, who don't wish to return to the North after the war. However violent communist prisoners formed on groups to claim total repatriation where all prisoners should return to North Korea. With this, they engage on a ruthless war massacre against the Anti-Communist. And we call this war between the POWs: the 3rd War in Koje Island. As situation gets worse, the US Army controlling the Prison Camp tries to repress violent communist POWs a total of 31 died and 164 were seriously injured on the prisoners' side. Whereas 1 died and 14 were wounded among US soldiers. It drew stark criticism from the international community, going so far as to getting the commander of the Prison Camp being thrown out. On the one hand, based on the reports from Pyokdong Prison Camp from North Korea, the POWs from the ally forces are having a good time, protected under the Geneva Convention. It's as if there is no trace of war there. Which is nothing shown of a stark comparison to Koje Prison Camp that's out of control. PRISONERS OF WAR BULLETIN Violent Riots in Korea POW Camp Fabricated propaganda. Of course. It seems there's no warfare. That's how you start the second half, gentlemen. Eat well, high well. Any thoughts? Sir, I've been in these parts for a good year now and these people won't listen without a sound beat. Sorry! Sorry! It's OK, it's alright... It's OK, don't worry. What was your name again? Your name? Me, Roberts. You? Name? Sam-shik. Sam-shik. That's it, Sam-shik. Sam-shik. Where was I? You were explaining the importance of the second half, Sir! Exactly. Victory in the second half is a game of numbers. Couple of bad seeds, we whip 'em into shape. When you run out the entire herd, gotta lure 'em in with something. Get 'em addicted to that sweet taste of freedom. Right, Sam-shik? No English. Nothing else to it, gentlemen. Voluntary repatriation is victory. Total repatriation is failure. Understood? Yes, sir! Alright then, let's change up the game here. Show 'em this camp under new management. Throw in a few special pardons while you're at it. Who should we pardon first? Who's the worst troublemaker you got? SWING KIDS NORTH KOREAN CAMP Here. Take it. It's yours! Comrade Ki-soo! Comrade Ki-soo! Comrade Ki-soo! ROH Ki-soo! ROH Ki-soo! Comrade Ki-soo! HWANG Ki-dong! Let me go! Do I smell a hero here, Comrade Ki-soo? I smell trouble with your yankee look! Comrade Man-chul. When you're polished like me, the yankees won't slight you. Try it, comrade. Fill me in on the news out here that I missed. It's crazy. The new commander is a damn weasel! He made talent shows and job trainings. He's luring the weak fools to seek capitalism. Damn bastards! Know who this is, damn traitors? He's ROH Ki-soo! Our hero ROH Ki-jin's brother! You yankee ass kissin' worthless traitors! I gotta vent it out like that. Yankees call it getting rid of s... style. Hey, you! You fucking Hey, whitey! Lights out, asshole! - Let's go! - Get all the goods! Stinky little bastards... I'll get you again. Stressed you out, huh? Yeah, you should be! Damn yankees! Hey, give that back! Thank you! Thank you? You fuckin' ass! Prick! What the fuck do you want, yellow midget? Fuck you! Kill that little... So your cheeks got chubbier because of this yankee shit? You got me all wrong. What's the basic rule in war? You blow the enemy's supplies. I'm not addicted to yankee shit, but destroying it. Hold on. Ki-soo? Chug this down. We steal the enemy's goods to build our strength. That's the plan. Good. Drink it. The black man is at it again. The yankees call that tap dance. I it wasn't for the war, you'd be dancing before our Leader. - Right? - Shut up. Fine. Stay back. It'll topple over. Who said to go this way? Nancy? Yes, In-ja? I mean Linda. If you mess up the dances again, you're out. I'll be good. In English? No problem. Are you all studying English? I can't translate for you forever. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Hey, Newbie! Yes? Watch and follow us carefully on your first day. What's your name again? YANG Pallae, ma'am. YANG Pallae... We use English names here. How about Candy? I'm Candy. Then... Julia? It's taken. Right. Just go with YANG Pallae. Ms. Linda? What's matter you? Do they give us food? We don't act like war refugees. Where are we? America! Who are we? Beautiful American girls! Music start! Baby, we're on fire! Step! Touch! Go Koje! Go America! Jump! 2 bucks if you set up us nicely. 3. 2.50 then. I said 3. Nigger... Boy, I'm gonna finally meet Jesus tonight. One, two! One, two! Smile! Hi! Woo-hoo! Yeah! What are you doing? What is this? Come on! Let's go. Push hard! One, two, three! Damn racket. What's your name? Move! Oh, wow. Hey, stinky armpits! Nice ass that you had. Let go! Let's make money! Let's dance! Oh, shoot! It's a fire! Jimmy, we gotta get outta here! Hey, you, I gotcha! High, son! Run, Sam-shik! I heard you threw quite a ball yourself, Sergeant. Little shame I missed it, though. Seems my invitation got lost in the mail. I apologize, Sir. Oh, no, no, I didn't call you here to apologize. See, I understand you used to be a dancer on Broadway before enlisting. Tap dance, wasn't it? How's about putting together a little dance team here? With some of these prisoners. Call me these POWs, Dance to the Dance the Free World. Makes one heck of a punchline, eh? I don't know, Sir. What don't you know? I'm not so sure Asians can tap dance, Sir. That's an awfully kind of statement coming from you, son. Same kind of prejudice that got you kicked off Broadway, isn't it? I understand you got a kid back in Okinawa. When the Japanese go, well she's an Asian too, isn't she? Just fooling around. Pull a little snafu... Once I get transferred back to Japan, I'll formally marry her. And who exactly is the man to make that happen for you? You're just one pick of shoulder to being dropped to Corporal and shipped back home. If I were you, son, I'd be out there digging haystacks for my ticket back to Okinawa. That is why you're saving up so hard, isn't it? With dollies, unauthorized dance parties, trading with the... domestics. Just put a fun little show that will grace all the front page headlines. I'm looking forward to it myself. You get it, Samdori! Okay! You, you, and you... Everyone failed. You, you, and you. Pass. No, they all failed. What's matter you? No problem. You all pass! - Yes! - Thank you, sir! Do you even speak English? I know I am number one beautiful girl. Long time no see. Exactly. Thank you very much. Watch out! - Duck! - Get down! Any other moves? He says go faster. Ask him if he knows something else. He wants you to try harder. That's enough, he's about to die! Everyone clap! Enough! Faster! Stop! Somebody stop him! - Nancy! Nancy! - Yes! All right! Who's next? - Me! - I can dance! Nice to meet you, Jackson. Thank you very much. Girls! Let's go home. Yes? Dancing... I heard civilians can join? Best English I've heard all day. Come back when you've grown some, kid. Then you need a translator, I can do it! No need for one without a dance team. I can't form a dance team with these clowns. 4 dollar one month, at any time you want. Try me for a day then fire me if you don't need. OK, 3 dollars. 2! Audition's over. I heard you're looking for dancers. Where is everybody? The auditions are over. This is all the music? What does he want? He's Chinese, I think he wants to show you dance. I lived in Manju so I can speak Chinese, too. I speak 4 languages. Korean, English, Chinese, and also Japanese. The last one is occupation hazard. It's 4 dollar because I can speak 4 languages but I give you special discount, 2 dollar and today's translation free. Got music for this? My chest... My heart... He says heart... maybe he has sickness... I need rest. I'm okay. Why did only Ki-soo get placed to work there? Comrade Ki-soo totally destroyed the yankee dance club alone! ROH Ki-jin in the frontlines and ROH Ki-soo in this camp! The hero brothers at large! So they're making him fix the hall all by himself? Damn yankees always want to give and take. An eye for an eye, you know? The black man in charge there asked for Comrade Ki-soo. He must want revenge. - Did he say anything else? - Yes. - What? - It was English. I don't know. How can our hero follow a black man's orders? - Don't go. - Right. Damn westerners are all wicked. Be careful. Don't worry. Real soldiers aren't afraid of the enemy camp. Be careful of one black man? I can pound him down like a hammer any day. Try. What the hell are you saying? Never mind. This is tap dance. Fun, isn't it? Comrade Ki-soo! Watch me. I made a new dance. Watch me, please? Pound hard! Hit 'em! Wash 'em clean! Pound harder! So... if you... I mean, if we... do well... things will be good. And they're gonna go well... So to make things good, we have to do well. So, let's do well. Any questions? He says let's do well. Questions? How well? Can we go places? Like tours? We go on tour? Yes. We will. How far can we go? Where? Anywhere. Everywhere. Like where? Be specific. Wherever. Anywhere just means everywhere. America. What?! So, we'll be famous, right? We become famous? Yes. How famous can we be? How famous? Very. And snacks? Snacks? You'll get some. Yes. How much? What kind of snacks, how famous? Extremely and all kinds. A lot. Thanks for picking me. Yes! Lots, loads, plenty!! you, you be famous, you go to Japan, America, and finally get out of... I get what he's saying. A wicked, black yankee, an anti-Communist loser... And... A playgirl. Watch your language! Why you little... Nice to meet you. You come to our country and trample all over it. Then you take some weak fools and teach 'em to be yankees? You're asking for it! I'll show you how strong our Republic is! Translate, girl. No way, commie. Watch it, girlie! I was born in '33! How old are you? Think you're old? I was born in '31. You look young! I was born in '28. Get lost, anti-Communist jerk! Forget dancing! Or in the name of socialism... You want start up a fight, you do it over dance. Why can I understand this black man? That hitting the ground dance ain't much. I challenge you in tap dance. If I win, no dance team. Why do you wanna be famous? To find my wife. If I get famous, she can come to me. If she's alive, that is. Why don't you dance with us? There's no pay in dancing. You don't dance to make money. You just do it. How about you? Dance? Why? Why ask why? You just dance if you can. See? He says the same thing. Too bad about your weak heart. You breathe heavily. It's because you're overweight. It's because of malnutrition. How can you have malnutrition! It's true! Touch here. I have big bones. It's not fat. You understand each other? That's all for today. Step. Tap. Right foot first, then left. Right foot first. Step. Tap, tap, tap. That's it. Long Live the Republic! Away with America! Unify Korea You lost weight! Hey, kid. You're not very tall so you should make your movements bigger. Hey, old man! Looks to me like your picture being dancer? I can't pay you for dancing, don't forget. - Let's eat! - Sure thing. Don't betray the Republic Remember our heroes who died for unification Isn't that a yankee dance? I saw it in a yankee film. Tap dance is American, right? Silly pea brain! Why would I do a yankee dance? Can you teach me? If you do, I won't tell anyone. A man keeps his promise even with a knife to his throat! What are you yappin' about so late at night? Why'd you hit me? Don't talk back to your elders, little twerp! Don't hit him. Kids are the hope of our Republic. Busy? Nope. Then come with me. Will they be ready by next week? No problem. Today, no size. One shoes. Next time, you position, me position. Time same, same. You okay? Okay. Okay, thank you so much. No problem. No problem. Shut your damn mouth! Don't kill me! It hurts! Sam-shik, you little bastard. Sucking up to yankees... Call that a life? Son of a bitch. Cut out 'traitor' on his forehead. You little bastard. Please! I beg you! That's for cutting food. Let's not dirty it. How dare you smile! Please don't kill me! I'm KANG Byung-sam. What's your name? No need for a traitor to know. I'm not a traitor. I just got on the wrong truck and ended up down here. No need for names at a POW camp. You're a traitor or not. Jackson said Communism or Capitalism don't matter here. Only dancing matters. Just dance. - Black yankee's name is Jackson? - Yes. And the Chinese soldier's name is Xiao Fang. He has malnutrition. And her name is YANG Pallae. Not interested. Remember, I'm older. And you do look old! My mistake. Stop sneaking glances at me. Got a crush on me? You don't stand a chance against our Republic's beauties. How do they look? A beautiful woman has an egg-shaped, white face. Half-moon shaped eyes, a pointy nose, and soft, supple, thin lips. Her clothes are red... Go away! - Your face is red! - No way! Is it because you're a commie? - Stop it! - Tell me! Hello! What's that? I don't know. Dancing with these on will help you hear your steps better. Be easy, though. What about his? These shoes are meant for dancers. Not gangsters. Damn yankee! Why did he leave Ki-soo out? After telling us to dance like him? Poor kid. Hey. You wanna dance? Commie boy wants to dance our dance? What the hell? I'm busy, pal. Lock up before you go. And wash your armpits, yankee! Have you seen moves like this? Get up, boy! Let's see your dance! Come get some of this, boy! Hey! Let's go four on four! Outta my way. Come on! That's tap dance, fool! Tap dance! What now? That's low! Let us go. You lost, man! You okay? You son of a... Bitch! You bastards! That hurts! Fuckin' assholes! Let go! Let me go! It's nothing out of the ordinary about a man losing his leg in war. Commie bastard! - Let me go! - Stop! I said stop, Corporal! Christ, what do you want?! Sergeant... Sir? What do you think you're doing? What do you think I'm doing? I'm cracking down on a commie. Ain't that what we came here to do? He's not a commie, Corporal. He's a part of my team. They all are. Let them all go. If I don't wanna? That's an order. Order? And since when do we start taking orders from niggers? Right. This is the military. And Negroes orders orders too. Damn... I must've forgotten. That's it, right? Okay? No problem! I have lots. No problem! No problem! Sorry. It's nothing. Let's see the package. "Annihilate Americans!" You're under arrest. One, two, three! We are happy! Alright! What shall we do about Sgt. Jackson? Sir? What's that now? Jackson, Sir. The dance team. Ah. Jackson, fine. Pull the plug. Send Mr. Jackson back on home after the event is over. States, not Japan. These boys are pretty damn good! Freedom! Let's work after the rain! Let's go! Did you eat? How's your chest? I'm fine. Jackson? When's he coming out? Not for a while. I made a new dance. It's called, 'I want to dance'. I want to find my wife soon, and show her our dance. - Think I lost weight? - Your face looks smaller! - I crave kimchi pancakes. - You eat that in China? Welcome! Yankee reporters are here. We should do something. Hey, kid! Looks like all that chocolate got you dancing like a damn yankee! But I learned this by watching Comrade Ki-... Stupid little twerp! Why would our hero do a yankee dance! Stop eating yankee food! Damn kid! Why's that traitor here? Why come get me like that? I'm sorry. I had no choice. Go inside. Hurry! - What are we doing here? - We have a plan. Reporters are here. If we put on a good show, we can get Jackson out and dance again. Let's dance! You're doing it to find your wife. The Chinese guy is doing it to lose weight. Pallae is doing it for money. But I got no reason to dance. Good luck. Of course, you have a reason! Then why are you so good! You're the best I've ever seen! You're our ace dancer! He's going for the goal! And kick! Goal! Sir. Gentlemen, I'll be back after a drink and a pee break. Let's hear it for our players! Ready! Don't worry! It's just mud! Just do the drill! Go left! Step! What's with you! One, two, three, four! Jump! Why jump on three? Are you okay? What happened? One, two! One, two! One, two, three! Here I come! I can't see! It's been fun knowing you. Outstanding! Are they GI's prisoners? Well, I can't lift the can of the back just yet but, um, they will be performing again on Christmas, Bet you'll be stuck in for long, Commander. - Thank you! - Sorry. Hey there. Come on! We are Swing... Kids! We nailed it during practice... What was that? You screwed up! - Let me see! Give me that! - No way! Jackson. Can we really go on tour? Are you kidding me? Once this war's through we really can go to America. Everyone of us. - They're awesome! - Give 'em back! Okay, okay. Never got a gift like this, huh? Work harder! We gotta beat the dirt out clean! Damn! Not the yankee... That's it! Hey, kid! Call that a turn? Watch carefully. What's that? Why you little! Come back here! Bravo! Take a seat, Sergeant. Sit down. Take a seat. That's a mighty fine playing there. Enough to make a man goddamn homesick. You're making it alright in this country? Yes, Sir. Your transfer papers to Okinawa. Seems Red Cross heard about little dance group from the reporters. The expectations are high. You put on a good show Christmas Eve, you be spending Christmas with your family in Japan. Signed and sealed. Good boy's gonna wait til Christmas morning, right? Is that how it goes? Commander? What's to become of my team, Sir? Your team? Is that how you see 'em? Your team? Hey, Jackson. Missing home, huh? I heard America is nice. Take the team and go. Speak English. I'm not going on tours. Why would a hero go around with traitors doing the yankee dance? Shit. That's a lie. Tap dancing makes me crazy! The sound of it makes my heart race. I know I shouldn't, but it makes me want to go to America someday. Then I can contend with other tap dancing yankees like you. Thinking about it gives me chills. When we're at peace, I'll come to you. Take the team and dance till you drop. For me, too. What a motor mouth. Carnegie Hall. Man, we'll all be up on that stage. And that means you too, kid. The grand stage of Carnegie Hall. Just picture. A stage 10 times bigger than the one we have here. With a big band of close to a hundred down in the pit. Thousands of seats packed full of people just waiting to see us dance. And all those lights? Picking up every single movement. Is Carnegie Hall! I mean, all the grace from there? Bojangles, Benny Goodman, Sony Terry, Duke, Jean Cooper and The Bird! One, two! Can you hear it? Thousands spring to their feet in a standing ovation! So you go faster! Faster! What's so funny? You call that dancing? You dance like this! Now, forget about Carnegie Hall. Come back, man. I'll teach you! Watch and follow me. That's it! That's it! Mae-hwa! My wife's name is Mae-hwa! If you ever meet Mae-hwa, tell her KANG Byung-sam is alive! That's me! KANG Byung-sam! From Hwanghae! Anyone from Hwanghae? Where are you from? Anyone from Hwanghae? Gwang-guk! Ki-soo! Ki-soo... Ki-soo... Charge! Charge! A dozen yankees charge at us holding great swords. Suddenly, a man jumped in front like a big tiger! Then the yankees' heads dropped and rolled all over! Who's the tiger? ROH Ki-soo's older brother! The Republic's hero, comrade ROH Ki-jin! Comrade Ki-soo and I went to school together. A Soviet dancer teacher once came and chose us for the national team. Ki-soo was first. I was second. Ki-soo? Though I'm like this, I can still dance. Like this. I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat? Eat this! So, this is chocolate? I heard it's so sweet and good, it numbs your senses? Have it all. Where are you from? Sariwon, Hwanghae. Sariwon... I heard women are pretty there. Your wife must be, too. My daughter is pretty. She resembles her mom. Know how it's like there now? Traitors and yankees attacked and razed the place. Then what? Damn motherfuckers are probably raping your wife and daughter. No! If they scream, the bastards will cut their throats. No way! It's true! You son of a bitch! When you're losing your minds over this yankee bait, your families back home are being slaughtered by Capitalist motherfuckers! You ignorant, worthless traitors! Fight with your lives! Take over this camp, then join the frontlines! Don't just sit there because the command didn't come! For our Leader and country! How dare you cross legs like yankees before our Leader's portrait! Cut 'em off! They're tainted! If yankees ideas got to your heads, cut 'em off now! Long live our great Leader! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Louder! Shout it with your lives! Annihilate the yankee invaders! Annihilate the yankees! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! I could get used to this. We love freedom! - Kill the traitors! - What's wrong? No! - Kill the traitors! - Kill them! I'll teach those commie bastards not to mess with me! Let's attack 'em! Follow me! Prepare the weapons! Let's bury 'em in shit! Don't kill us! I am sorry! Help! Open up! Damn commie bastards! Jesus Christ... That damn yankee is mine. If you wanna dance again, pretend you're dead. We believe they were under direct orders from the North. In a half-decent game plan, we'd had my head on a platter. This is missing that certain panache. The least we can do now send the ball back over, don't you think? Perhaps we should put in a request for tanker armor vehicle? I keep telling you, leave the artillery to the boys in the front, this is a battle of the wits. What do you suppose would make your day, if you were a prisoner? Family... Wouldn't they wanna see their family, Sir? Damn straight. Damn straight. So one commie is all we need. We find the loneliest, most homesick sucker of 'em all. We nab him. We show him just how sweet life can be. Yankees are camped out at places we planned to attack. There must be a mole among us. Split up the weapons and hide them. Leaders refrain from being together. Remember, a spy is close by. Keep watch on each other. Comrade Ki-soo! I heard ROH Ki-jin is missing. But don't worry, he's invincible. I'm not worried. I haven't seen you knocking off yankees' heads these days. And I heard the yankee you stabbed is walking around fine. But I guess yankees all look the same. Get to the point. Set an example as the brother of a hero. By doing what? Show us if the black man's blood is red or black? Piece of cake. All is vain. Life is futile. Oh, excuse me... How dare you! Get out, bitch! You worthless shit! Nice to meet you, bitch! Get up! Who says you can work without our permission? - I did it to survive. - What the hell are you saying? People die in war! Just die, bitch! Die! Die! Die! Try and kill me, bitches! Linda! I'll kill you, whores! She's a commie! She's a damn commie! She was ordered to come and spread the plague! No! I'm not a commie! I'm South Korean! She's a commie! Get her! I'm not a commie! Jackson! Did you eat? You won't be able to work for a while. You could use some money. I didn't work. I will not take it. Just take it. That's on New Year's Day. Just so happens, I'm completely broke. Thank you very much! How did you end up here anyway? They say only trouble-making soldiers get sent to Korea. Back in America being black makes you a troublemaker. What? Don't complain. You should try living here as a woman. Bad as it seems, being black is worse. No, being a woman is more worser. Being a black man amongst white people is... - What about in the middle of war... - You... What about dance? Can we dance again? You know well enough too many of that. We're restricting civilians entry until things settle down. What about ROH Ki-soo? You think he kill people too? I don't know. Pretty much kill or be killed in there. Communism, capitalism. If nobody knew what they were no one would kill or be killed. Well maybe after a while you'll all remember you're one people and stop fighting over ideology. Fucking ideology. Fucking ideology. You know what? These are magic shoes. When I wear them, war, food, miserable things they all just disappear. I bet they feel the same. There's a song staying in my head I can't explain it but maybe I can show you. Cold noodles. Pickled halibut. Dumplings. Didn't you already say that? Fish platter. I was going to say that! Stop it! I saw that if you list off the food you crave or say what you did before war, you'll be the first to die. Hello, leaders. I brought some snacks. What did you do before the war? I was a school teacher. You remind me of my teacher. And you? I owned a restaurant. His dream was to become an artist. I wanted to become a poet. That's why you're so good with speeches! When we return home after winning the war, let's all gather at your place and have a drink. The drinks will be on me. I used to be a singer. Make sure you call me for a drink, too. I'll sing you a song. Great idea! How about a song for us now? Stop! I saw somewhere... Good boy! Translate that. Yes, Sir! What did he yap about? Damn bosses always talk too much no matter what race. Drink it. And have some cookies. Thanks for leading us to their weapons. But he worries the commies are too quiet. Damn whities are chicken. Fuckin' bastards. He wants to root out the rebels once and for all. He wants the leader who gets orders from the North. If I spilled on the weapons, they said I'd meet my granny. How would I know the secret commander here? Hold on. Sir! He asks us that we keep our promise, Sir. Don't throw it, asshole. I don't get why I'm working under them. How'd we end up under them? Here. There's no future here. They're bringing your granny. Have her live in luxury before passing away. You're the mole? Let go! It was you? You killed Gwang-guk! Let me go! Anti-Communist bastard! How could you! You should talk! What about you? I did it to save my family. My granny... I did it to meet her. But what about you? Dancing like a yankee! Will that bring back your dead mom or help you meet your brother? That's why you went crazy tap dancing? How did you know? You tap dance in your sleep! How could I not? You're crazy about it! You should know! Communism or Capitalism! The Americans an Soviets made them for them! What's that got to do with us! Because of their ideology, why does... my granny have to die? You've lost your mind. Brainwashed and killing people because of ideology is crazy! I'm fine as hell! Look. I'll do what I have to. You do what you want. Mae-hwa! Do you know Mae-hwa? Tell her KANG Byung-sam is looking for her! Did you say, 'Mae-hwa?' You're looking for Mae-hwa? She's up ahead. Comrade Mae-hwa! Mae-hwa! Mae-hwa! Get down, prisoner! Back to your track! Get back, commie! I don't know English! Mae-hwa! Sorry! Forgive me! I thought she was my wife! Don't kill me! ROH Ki-jin! ROH Ki-jin! ROH Ki-jin! ROH Ki-jin! Brother! They say it's an honor. There hadn't been many soldiers that wracked up as many close combat kills as you have in the history of warfare. Truly extraordinary. Would you like to meet your brother? He's doing quite well here. Translate. Yes, Sir! I wasn't listening to the fool! Just keep pacing! Sir! I'm told that your brother has been a tremendous assistance. Give me food! I don't think the prisoner ROH Ki-soo would be able to continue with us, Commander. Now, what did I tell you in the beginning? 'Communist dance to the dance of the free world'. Now that's the game plan here. That little pecker is the only reason this dance group exists. The risk is too high. Sounds like you got something fogging up your noggin', Jackson. It's not a matter of one-time circus freak show, anyhow. It's much more complicated. Complicated? I can deal with complicated, son. What I don't need is complication. Commander, I'm... Sergeant! Look around. Smell the coffee. These people turning up commies left and right. Relatives, neighbors, hell... even the dog down the street gets labelled communist if the wind blows strong enough. Now what do you think what'll happen if they don't perform? Especially that North Korean boy. You see, that's what really complicates things. Get him on that stage, it's the only thing that's gonna keep 'em alive. Let's disband. What dancing in the middle of war? I only did it to find my wife. I'm done with it. If only my wife... If only she's alive... I just wish she's alive. I'm sorry. Hey! Leave it on. This should kill off all the traitors. It's not enough. Hurry up and make more. We must kill all the anti-Communists! How much? $1. $1. Food okay? Food okay. Mae-hwa... "Dear grandson..." Not me! After all the traitors I... We suspect the Communists are receiving orders through a senior colonel hiding on the grounds. Perhaps now would be the time to finally set the bait, Sir, if we're going to weed out the bad seed before Christmas. Release ROH Ki-jin. Comrade Ki-soo! Did you hear? Hear what? Comrade Ki-jin got released! Damn yankees don't give without a reason. What give and take are they... Catch! It's gotten a lot colder. Warm up by the fire, comrade. Comrade Ki-jin? Come here. It's been a while. Shouldn't you two meet up close? I was an actor before joining the army. Know what role I usually played? Isn't it obvious? The village dummy! Sorry, sorry! No English. Thank you. Sorry! Your kicks must be hard from all the tap dance training. Who are you, comrade? Who do you think? The commie the commander is dying to catch. The leader getting orders from the North. Like tap dancing? Forgive me, sir! Don't be. Wasting your talent is a sin. Keep doing your best. Speaking of tap dancing... Get on stage at Christmas when the Red Cross people come. Comrade? What good is killing 100 small fries? The top guy is important. Shoot the commander in the head and become a real hero. Comrade Ki-jin. Shoot I mean shoot yourself in the head, comrade. Or, I'll put a hole through your brother's head. Don't do it! Isn't the war great? How else would a nameless actor like me become a commander? How could comrade Ki-jin become a hero? He's a giant with the IQ of a toddler. Bang! Bang! Die! Bang! Whether he remains a hero or an idiot with a traitor brother is all up to... I'll do it! I'm itching like crazy to tap dance anyway! I'll go on stage. While I'm up there, I'll shoot the commander! You're a traitor from now on. I've been one for a while. One who's crazy about the yankee dance. TRAITOR If things go wrong, I'll tattoo that for real. Listen to my command! Our goal is to get them to think we fell for their trap. Let them think they wiped us out to loosen their security. Make the commander think he succeeded. Easy ball... - Long live North Korea! - Long live Communism! Ready! Set! Fire! Focus! Bury him quickly! There are corpses everywhere! What did I miss? Do it from the start. Come on! Christmas is around the corner! Let's practice. That's enough for today. you put yourself at risk if you go on that stage. I want... just dance. - I'm serious! - What do you mean? Once you're addicted to yankee shit you can't stop. - Ki-soo is no exception. - Shut up! He can't be. Is the food ready? Is it true? Are the rumors true? What's that? Let me see. - What is? - It's American... Move! Out of my way! You fuckin' little... You better get that back. You goddamn bastard. I'm warning you fuckhead, I got a gun there. I'm gonna use it! Your mom is pretty. You must take after your dad, so nasty looking. No, no, no, stop, stop! I'm sorry! I didn't mean that. Bastard. You're lucky. You got a home, a mom, and a country to go back to. And you can dance. Hey! Did it hurt? Good job, staying alive. Sorry I don't have any rewards for you. That's for kids! The Republic's hero looks stupid doing that. When the war's over, ask for a pretty wife. They should reward a hero, right You wife, too. I did everything already. I held hands. I even kissed her till my teeth almost fell out. What? A rooster? A pig! A car! Don't you know? Grandpa Rudolph takes Santa the reindeer to... Found you! How do you divide up a piece of Spam? 8 times! Thank you! Thanks! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You're still alive? Well, it's Christmas... Thanks for everything, Sam-shik. Thank you. Mr. Roberts. So when they plan to bring out the fun guns, Commander? Oh, they're up next, just a hell of a show, huh? Unless you want to return to your family as a traitor, pay your dues. Remember, I'm everywhere. Mr. Roberts. Thank you, thank you. Oh, no, no. Sit, sit. Sit down. Enjoy the show. Relax! Don't get nervous. Jackson! Loosen up! One, two, three! Start with your left. Good evening. Byung-sam? When the show's over, run straight to your wife. This stage... this dance is about longing for freedom. Prisoners of war fighting communism... When we're done, take them and run out of here. We're touring together. Don't think of leaving. Kid. Longing for liberalism... I apologize, first I'd like to give my sincere gratitude to Brig. Gen. Commander Norman B. Roberts for giving us this opportunity tonight. So according to the Commander's orders, we prepared a colorful spectacle for you all to see. A real circus. Sir. This team is... who made up of a Chinese prisoner who would've been a brilliant choreographer if it wasn't for the war; a bright, confident, strong-willed young woman who's forced to provide for her family after losing both her parents; a civilian who became a prisoner only because he was wrongfully accused of being the commies; a Communist dancer who could've stood on the stage of the Carnegie Hall if it wasn't for political ideology; and a humble black man who has found his only friends in life in this four individuals. Ladies and gentlemen, we are... 'The Swing Kids' and the title of this performance is... 'Fuck Ideology'. Jackson! I love you, man! What's going on? Son of a bitch! Brother! Bro! No! No! You fuckin' bastards! You motherfuckers! Mr. Roberts? Okay? Okay? Sir? He's with me. He's with me! Step aside. You fuckin' bastards! Murderer! Murderer! Move! Get up. Come on. Please. Get up. Ki-soo! Ki-soo! Here we are, you've come a long way. Please watch your steps, gentlemen. Yes, please come on off. We'll now be entering the Historic Park of Koje POW camp which is our last. Lastly we're gonna watch a movie related to the history of the Koje Island. Oh, yes, and look at this building to your left, it was closed when a group of terrorist which pose as a dance performance team tried to kill the commander but they didn't tear down the building. And back then, Commander Roberts was all about having a free life in the... Hey, Jackson! Not admitting you lost is worse than losing. You don't know, do you? Screw you! I haven't started yet.
