I had that dream again. The one where I'm back at graduation, wearing an oversized hourglass on a chain around my neck. Colorful grains of sand rush through it, representing the remaining time we have together. As the final grains fall, I'm standing at my bedroom window, watching you disappear. Your body fades away as though you are evaporating into thin air. It's the type of dream I should probably relay to a shrink, if only I weren't too proud to admit how losing you has affected every aspect of my life. Whoever started the rumor that teenagers haven't lived long enough to understand what true love is didn't know us. Anyway, what I wanted to say is that I miss you and I think about you every day. I wonder where you are, and what you are doing, and hope you sometimes think of me too. I try not to regret the decision I made but often question how different my life might be if I hadn't left you there that day. I ask myself, "If I could, "would I go back and stop everything from changing?" Probably. I would go back for you. You were my world. Lillian, Anna! Hey! - Hey, there you guys are. Where were you sitting? - Front row. Some one wanted a good seat. - Well, they should have had you sing at this shindig, Lil. Two hours with no music was brutal. - Maybe next year. I got accepted into Honors Choir. - Miss you. - Hey. I missed you. - You have vision. I am so glad that's over. - Hey, best walking I've seen in awhile. - Yeah, the dress suits you too. - Jason's grad party? See you there? - Lizard, don't you actually have to graduate to go to a grad party? - Watch it, pretty boy. Whoa. - What? You think that's funny? - It's a joke, man. - Hey, I'm not gonna make it tonight, all right? We have plans. - I got some information you're gonna want. - Well can it wait? - I hope she's worth it. - Hey, watch it. - Whatever, man. Don't you dare come crawling back to me when you get sick of these Sunday School friends. Always a pleasure, that one. - I am so sorry about that. Hey. Mom and dad ready for pictures? - Yeah, they're ready. - Hey. - We'll be at Thomas' later if you guys you wanna come by. - Okay, sounds good. - Thanks for coming, guys. I mean it. - See you later, man. - So, now that schools over and I can pick up a few more shifts at the restaurant, I'm thinking about taking you on a nice, fancy date. Really? Fancy date? - I might even where khakis. - Right. I won't count on it. - You saved my life, Lillian. - I didn't do anything. - No. I mean it. You have no idea. Without you, I'd be at some crazy graduation party with Lizard. Just wasting another night of my life. Before you, before us, I wasted so much time on things that didn't even matter. But instead... I'm here. With you. And it's perfect. - It is perfect, isn't it? - Just think how different things would be if you hadn't busted in the snow that day. - I would've gotten along just fine, thank you very much. - You would have been a Popsicle. - I'm sure. Brad! - I hope riding around in your dad's SUV doesn't ruin you for my truck. - Nope. I love your truck. - Well, I hope I hear you through the speakers one day. You're a better singer than half these people they play. Only half? - Hey, you know what I mean. I'm your biggest fan. You're going to be late if we go to my house first. I'm gonna drop you off and then walk from there. - Are you sure? It's so dark out. - You worry about me too much. ♪ This is the way I belong I had a great time with you tonight. - Me too. With you. Will you text me and let me know you got home okay? - You're doing it again. - What? - My phone's dead. Don't worry. I'll look both ways before I cross the street. - Okay. - I'll call you tomorrow. Pick you up at seven for the movie. - Sounds great. I might even let you decide what we see. - Don't tease me. - I'm serious. There are several romantic comedies you can choose from. - You're lucky you're so cute. I'll get the truck cleaned up in the morning. Thanks for the perfect night. - My pleasure. - Lillian? - Yeah? - Nevermind. - Are you okay? - Never been better. Good night. - Good night. Dad? Hello? You scared me. - Someone will hear you. - Hey, what are you doing here? - I'm sorry but I need to tell you something. It's important. - Brad, what is it? - You don't need to say anything but I need you to know. Lillian, I love you. I love you so much. Good night. - Hey, hey. I love you. - See you soon, Lil. Good night. - Good night. - Love you. - Lillian? Lillian? Wake up, Lillian. Lillian. I'm awake, what's up? - Mrs. Lee has been trying to get a hold of you. She said Brad never came home last night. She wanted to know if you know where he is. - What? No. I don't know where he would be. What time is it? - Where did he say he was heading to after he dropped you off? - Home. He was going home. No, Mrs. Lee must be confused, just let me call him. - Okay. I'll let her know. - Thanks. Hi, you've reached Brad Lee. Leave a message. - Hey, babe, it's me. Are you all right? Your mom has been calling here trying to find you. Just let me know that you're okay, all right? Hey, can you come over? So, apart from the obvious "best night ever" thing, how was your date? It was great. Really great. - You wake me up at 8AM and I get no details. - Well, he told me that he loves me. - Shut up! What did you say? Did you tell him you love him, too? - I just said, "I love you too." It was kinda magical. - You realize you've come completely full circle now, right? - What? - From completely despising him in middle school, coming home crying because he teased you to falling in love. My gosh, you are so weird. So weird. - Whatever. I'll forgive you for waking me up at the crack of dawn and I'm sorry for doubting you had huge news. - Well, honestly that's not really why I called you over here, though. - Don't tell me, did you get engaged too? - No. Nothing like that. - I'm sorry. Go ahead. - So, Mrs. Lee called and said that Brad didn't come home last night. She doesn't know where he is. - What do you mean? Where could he be? - I don't know. I've called his phone like 20 times. - Well, is there any way that he went to Jason's party and just ended up crashing there? - No. No, you know as well as I do that Brad doesn't party. Let alone crash somewhere. It just doesn't sound like something he would do. - Well it's not like you and Lizard are exactly friends. Maybe he wanted to go to the party with him but didn't want to upset you. - Trust me, Brad doesn't want to go anywhere with Lizard. - Well, maybe he wanted to go out but knew you couldn't because of your curfew. - He would've told me though. - Well does he tell you everything? - He tells me he loves me. - Look, I'm sure everything is fine. In this town, you can't go far without someone seeing you. I'm sure he's around and had a perfectly good explanation. - I know, you're right. I almost forgot, we're going to the drive-in tonight at seven. Except, I hope I don't have to wait that long for him to give me an answer. What is so funny? - You do love him. - Yes! What, you didn't believe me before? I said, "I love you." Hi, you've reach Brad Lee. Leave a message. - Brad, it's me again. Please call me. Your parents are worried about you and so am I. I love you. Bye. Hey Kara, did you see Brad at Jason's party last night? Yeah, I called Kara but she didn't see him so I was wondering if maybe you knew. Brad? - Lillian? Sweetie, it's Janice Lee. - I'll pass it along to the detective but I don't think you have any reason to be alarmed. Some kids, they just have too much fun on graduation night. - Thank you, appreciate it. - Mrs. Lee, are you there? Did Brad come home? - Sorry. The deputy was just leaving. We haven't heard from him yet but they are convinced there's no need to worry. - Do you think there is? - I'd feel better if his truck wasn't here, but I know it's easy enough to get around this little town on foot. - Well I called Jason and Kara and a bunch of other people from school but no one remembers seeing him at that party after he left here, so. - We've called the hospital, the jail. Part of me thinks we're overreacting but this just isn't like him. Not anymore, anyway. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. If you hear from him, have him call me right away. - Yeah, of course. Please do the same. We're supposed to go out tonight. He's supposed to pick me up at seven. - Well if I know him at all, he wouldn't dare be late picking you up. - Yeah. Well, I'll keep making calls until then. There's one number I don't have. I'm sorry but the person you called has a... So that's how we're gonna play this? Brad, where are you? God, please let him be okay. Please let us be okay. - Can I help you? - No, I was just looking for someone. - If he's thinking that just 'cause he's graduated that the rules don't apply anymore... - I know but this isn't like him. I'm worried. - This is literally the longest day of my life. - Just breathe and get ready for your date, okay? He'll be there. - He's way too in love to stand you up, Lil. - I hope you're right. Hi, you've reached Brad Lee. Leave a message. - He isn't here. Hey, what's going on? Small groups are going to search different areas downtown. Are you okay? - Any news, Lillian? - No. - I've asked everybody I could think of. No one remembers him at my party last night, including me. - Yeah, well, he said he wasn't going. So I guess that much was true. Jason, let's get your group going. I'm sorry but the person you called has a voicemail box that has not been... - Stop calling me. - Lizard? Lizard, don't hang up. Listen, everyone is looking for Brad. I just need you to tell me if you've seen him or you know where he might be. - Well, I already told you I ain't seen him. - Well the least you could do is come over and help us find him. - Why would I do that? It sounds like you can't keep tabs on your man. - This isn't a joke, Michael. I swear, if there's something you aren't telling me. - Yeah, okay, well the only thing I'm gonna to tell you is stop calling me. And you can tell Brad's mommy and daddy to stop bugging me too. This is harassment. - Lil, are you okay? Let's go find Brad. Come on, I'll drive. - Stop! Stop the car! It's him, I saw him! Brad! - We should hang the rest of these posters up before we head back. Is that okay with you? - Of course it's okay. - One of us should stay here with her. - No. I wanna be alone. - Okay, Lil. Well, we'll be right outside the car if you need us, okay? Lock the doors. Lillian, are you okay? You're hurt, just let me help you. I just need to find my key. I can get you inside. Just trust me. - How did you know you could do that? - Do what? - The lock with the door. - There's always a worn out lock or loose window. I guess I wasn't giving you enough credit. Now you've progressed from playground bully to common criminal. - I wouldn't go that far. Although, I guess the bully part's true. Hey, we did some pretty stupid stuff when we were kids. Me, Lizard, Jones. - Like? - Well, broke into a few houses. But we never stole anything. Well, not anything valuable. We just take people's food and throw little parties if we knew they were out of town. Stuff like that. It's stupid, I know. It was a long time ago. - That's interesting. Wasn't it just last month that the Grant's came home from Christmas vacation to find an empty fridge and a trashed kitchen? - You sure find it impossible to trust me, don't you? Yeah, it happened but I wasn't even there. Lizard and Jones still do their thing but I don't hang around them much anymore. Especially since Lizard dropped out of high school, I only really see him when I'm working on my truck in his shop. Things have changed, you know. - Yeah. I guess you could say that. - You don't have to believe me. I'll show you. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but I will. You'll see. - Why? Why do you care so much what I think about you? This is perfect, Brad. Thank you. - You're just lucky your parents keep the cabinets stocked. How're you doing? - I'm fine. My ankle's a little frozen from the ice but it doesn't hurt any more. I was actually just thinking about middle school. - You... You don't have to say it. I was such a jerk. - You tormented me. I used to lay awake at night thinking up excuses not to go to school the next day. - Look at us now, chatting like old chums. I'm so sorry, Lillian. I was just a stupid kid. I'd give anything to take it back. There's... There's something I've been meaning to tell you. - Yeah? - I saw you sing at church a few weeks ago. The Sunday night service. - You did? You're never at church. I don't remember seeing you there. - I was. And you were incredible. Incredible? Pretty big word. - Not big enough. It's... It's getting pretty late. I should probably go. You gonna be okay until your parents get back? - Yeah. I'll be fine. Thank you. For everything. - You asked why it matters what you think about me. Because I already wasted too much time not caring. - Lillian? Lillian, are you all right? The detective's waiting inside. He'd like to speak with you. - Miss White? - Lillian. - Lillian, I'm Detective Padron. I'd like to ask you some questions if you don't mind. Now, I understand that you were with Brad Lee on the evening of May 16th, is that correct? - Yes, he dropped me off at my front door at 10. - And that's the last time you saw Brad? - Yes. - Did he give you any indication of where he was going? - Home. He said he was going home. - And you don't think that he was going to any other graduation parties, other festivities? - No. He was invited to a graduation party at Jason Hamilton's house but he didn't want to go. - Lillian, do you have any reason to believe that Brad might harm himself? - What? No. No, not at all. - And to your knowledge, Brad was not recently involved in any drugs or narcotics? - No. No, Detective, Brad is a good guy. He wasn't involved in anything like that. That's why I just know that something is really wrong. - Miss White, while I appreciate your desire to defend his character, his criminal record is telling us a very different story. - His criminal record? - Brad? No. I know he was involved in a few harmless, childish pranks but he never said anything about... - I'm not at liberty to give you any of the details but his juvenile record includes many crimes for which he was tried and convicted. The most recent of which... was December... - The snow. - I beg your pardon? - Lillian? Do you know something about that? - No. No, that was a long time ago. Detective, you have Brad all wrong. The person that you need to speak to is Lizard. - I'm sorry, did you say Lizard? Is that a classmate of Brad's? - Yes. Well, no, he dropped out earlier in the year and now he has some car repair shop in an old barn off Highway 41. But, Michael Lizardo, that's his real name. He was Brad's friend before we were together. He was upset with Brad the night of graduation. I'm sure if you just talk to him... - Yeah, yeah, Michael Lizardo. I've already spoken with him. In fact, he called the station to report that you have been harassing him. - What? - Have you been repeatedly contacting Mr. Lizardo in an attempt to get more information about Brad's whereabouts? - No. I mean, yes, I've called him a few times but I've called everyone. I'm just trying to find Brad. - Miss White, I need to ask you to refrain from contacting Mr. Lizardo again. You need to let me do my job. If Michael has more information about Brad, it needs to come through me. I'm sure you understand. - Yes, sir. - All right. Is there anything else of significance from that night? Anything he might have said? - No. Well, except he told me that he loved me. - Is that the first time he told you that? - Yes. - So to clarify, the first time Brad Lee told you he loved you was on your front porch the night he went missing. - Well, yes. - Yet, you don't believe that he was planning on leaving town that night. Even though this is the first time he told you that. - Lillian, it does sound like he may have had other intentions behind what he said. Are you sure nothing seemed strange? You didn't get the feeling he was trying to tell you anything? - No. No, we had a perfect picnic on the lake after graduation. It was a really great night, that's all. He wasn't telling me he loved me as a goodbye. I am positive. - Okay. I think that's all I need from you, Lillian, if that's the whole story. - So what happens next? - Next, we keep an eye out. There's been speculation that Brad has stolen a car, that he's on the run, and if that is the case then we'll track him down. - Stolen a car? - As I said, it's speculation. Brad's 18, if he desires to leave town, he has every right. - But he didn't desire to leave town. He was supposed to be here with me tonight! - Lillian, calm down. I think that's all for now. - Thank you for your time. - As we close, I'd like us to take a moment and pray for one of our young members, Brad Lee. For reasons that we do not yet know, he has not contacted his friends or family since Friday evening. If anyone has come in contact with Brad, please urge him to reach out to his family. We pray that this young man is in no danger and that he will make smart decisions. And we pray for our local law enforcement team who is overseeing this case. We believe that Brad is out there and that he will return to his family and those who love him. Lillian, breakfast! - Please God, please help me find him. Please do something. Forget it. - Good morning, senior. - Morning. - Have a seat, I'll whip you up some toast. - Thanks but I'm really not hungry. - Lillian, you need to eat something. You look terrible. - Thanks. - I didn't mean it like that. Have you finished working on that application to Meredith? - Please, Mom, we already talked about this. I don't even know if I gonna go to college next year. - Your future doesn't have to stop just because... - That's Anna, gotta go. - Come straight home after school today. We're not finished talking about this. ♪ And I said ♪ Hey, hi, hello, nice to meet ya ♪ ♪ He said, I don't think I've seen ya ♪ ♪ I don't think I've seen ya ♪ Before - Good morning, darling. Sorry, it took me forever to figure out what to wear. - It's fine. You got here just in time. - I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks. You ready to go back to school? - Can I say no? - Yeah. I get it. I miss him too. Even though he graduated, it's still gonna be weird. Without him, I mean. Look, I know today is probably going to be rough. But I'm here for you, okay? We all are. - Thanks. ♪ Hey, hi, hello ♪ I learned how to feel alive ♪ Driving down the 95 ♪ All before the sunrise ♪ I let the sun lick - Day one. Only 163 more to go. Yes, I counted.

Lillian's really nice but there was always something a little off about him. Poor thing. I expect you all completed your summer course work and you're prepared for a pop quiz? We'll do a quick review of chapters one and two before we get started. - Lillian. - Lillian, are you paying attention? Did you hear what I said? - What? - Are you okay? - I think I need some air. Decaff coffee? All right. Hi there, sweetie, how can I help you? - I'd just like to use your phone if that's okay. - Of course. As long as it's a local call. My boss gets real annoyed if we call long distance. - Yes, ma'am. - I bet you gotta call your sweetheart, don't ya? - No, ma'am. Morris County Police Department. - Yes, Detective Padron, please. It's Lillian White. I was calling regarding Brad Lee's case. Hold, please. Miss White? - Hello, Detective Padron. I just I wanted to check in and see if there is any new information. About Brad, I mean. Anything you can tell me? - No, there are no new leads. Few and far between, in fact. - Please don't give up on Brad, Detective. I need him to be found. - Lillian, no one's giving up but I just hope that you understand that some people just don't want to be found. If we get a break, you'll be one of the first informed, okay? Head on back to class. - What are you doing? - Sorry to scare you. You dropped your bag. Thanks. - Chris. - Chris. Do I know you? - Lillian? - How do you know my name? I asked you a question. - Everyone knows your name. I mean because of Brad. Sorry, that came out wrong. - Now I know. You came to the first search. - Yeah. I didn't think you saw me. Can I buy you lunch? - Look, I have a boyfriend. - It's not a date, it's just lunch. - Okay. - She sure is a pretty one. Smart boy. What'll it be, kids? - Cheeseburger, onion rings and a soda. Please. - I'll have the same. - Coming right up. - You come here often? - Yeah. Well, I used to. So what's your story? Why don't I know you from school? - Well, you don't know me from school because I'm not from here. I come into town every now and then to help out with my Grandma. - If you're not from here, why did you come that night? To the search, I mean. - I guess it was the right thing to do. Where do you think he is? - I look in every ditch, creek bed, dark alley... but I don't think he's dead. I mean, maybe he's being held somewhere or in some sort of trouble. Honestly, I wonder where he is 24 hours a day and I can never come up with a good enough answer. - Here you go, sugars. Your burgers should be right out. I'm guessing you two young things should be in school. But I sure am glad you're here. You know you're getting old when you can't even read your own handwritin'. - Let me take a stab at it. Looks like two eggs over easy, no salt, and a double order of bacon. Seems a little counterproductive, don't you think? - That's exactly it. Quite a keeper you have here. - You got so nervous. - Sorry, I've never skipped school before. Like, ever. - And look at you now, such a rebel. ♪ If I say I'm leaving ♪ Would you carry on without me when I'm gone ♪ ♪ Say that you'll come with me ♪ ♪ We can both be lost together ♪ Together, not alone ♪ We can both be lost together ♪ Together, not alone - Thanks for lunch and everything. Today was really tough and this, just talking and laughing, it was what I needed. - Me too. I should go. - Okay. - I'll be heading back to Gladeville soon. Maybe I'll see you around. - I waited for you after school. - I'm sorry. I had to get out of there. - First, I waited by the car. Then I looked around inside the hallways and checked the guidance office. I even checked the bathrooms to make sure you were okay. - Anna, I wasn't thinking. - I even skipped tennis practice so I could look for you! You couldn't send me a message? - My phone died. - Ever hear of the good old fashioned way? Write a note and stick it in my locker? - Anna, I'm really sorry. - No, it's fine. Just, let me know next time you don't need a ride. I was worried about you. Anyway, the main reason I came over here is to tell you that Thomas and I were talking about the Fall Social today and he told me that Caleb, you know Caleb Marino, wants to ask you. - Ask me what? - To the dance. - What? What did you tell him? - I said I thought that sounds great. Caleb is such a fun guy. - What? No. No, I can't do that. - You can go as friends, I didn't mean it had to be like that. - No, Anna, I have a boyfriend. - I know you have a boyfriend, Lil! Thomas knows, Caleb knows, everyone knows! - What's your point? - My point is that no one, including you, knows where he is. - Anna! - No, I mean it. What if six months from now there's still no sign of him? What about two years? He's gone, and it's a terrible feeling but you could ruin your life waiting on him. - Stop! You sound like my mom. You mean in all the time that you could have been helping me find him you've been waiting to tell me to move on? - I spent half my summer looking for him, Lil! I got ten thousand mosquito bites from traipsing through every field in Morris County looking for him! We looked everywhere and we didn't find anything. - So is that why you decided to give up? Decided you'd rather spend your time working on your tan than finding one of your friends? - No! I stopped looking for him because I couldn't stand seeing you like that. - Like what? - Like this! Do you know what people are saying about you? They ask me, "How do keep spending time with Lillian? "It's like she's not even there. "She's consumed with her own misery." And I can't even defend you anymore because it's true! It's enough to miss Brad but I'm also missing you. - Anna. - You and Brad were together for six months. But you and me, we've been best friends for over ten years. - I'm sorry. - I'm not asking you to be sorry. So, where were you today anyway? - I just went into town. I just had something to eat and ran into Chris. - Chris? Chris, who? - Chris... Um... You don't know him. He's just a new friend of mine. - So, you're going to sit here and throw a fit when I try to tell you to come to the dance with me and our little group of friends but you're off skipping school to hang out with some guy that you just met? Are you listening to yourself? You're unbelievable. I have nothing left to say to you. Except, find another ride to school. - She's right. What am I doing? God, please help me. Please bring him home, I can't go on like this. It's enough to miss Brad but I'm also missing you. Some people just don't wanna be found. You saved my life, Lillian. You saved my life. We looked everywhere. We didn't find anything. - We didn't look everywhere. Hello? ♪ Watch out, something's coming this way ♪ ♪ It's coming in to town Hello? ♪ Ride, ride, there's nothing there ♪ - What're you doing here? Didn't that cop tell you to leave me alone? - Hi, Lizard. - Answer the question. I said, what are you doing here? - I'm here to find Brad. - I don't see him, do you? - Cut it out, Lizard, listen, we need to talk. This has gone on long enough. - Why don't you step into my office? - No. - Tryin' to be polite. You having car trouble? - No. - What would bring you out here? You never made that trek before. - I just need to know. Do you have any information that might help me find him? Anything at all. Lizard, you're his best friend. - No, that punk's no friend of mine. - What're you talking about? - You should know. You're the one that got him thinking he was better than everybody. He was dating this little church thing. - That's not true. Lizard, listen, whatever resentment you're harboring against Brad because of me, it has to stop, okay? Our best friend is missing and no one is doing anything about it. - If you're so smart, how come you haven't you found him yet? You couldn't pray him back? - Trust me, you are the last person in the world I wanted to ask for help. Why do think it took me all this time? I wouldn't be here if I had any other option. Okay, so you can report me, threaten me, change your number, I don't care. But I can't take this anymore. Okay, I have to find him. So, please, if there's anything that you haven't told me. - A man came looking for Brad. - Wait, what do you mean? When? - The day before he... The day before the graduation. - Who was it? - I don't know. It was some old guy, all right? I'd never seen him before and I'd never seen him since. - What did he look like? - The way old guys look. Okay, he was bald, fat, old. He just came in, said he wanted to talk to Brad. I told him he wasn't there. - Did he say anything else? - No. - Did you say anything else? - I told him where he might find him. - As in, you told him where Brad lived? - Yeah. - So, some guy just randomly shows up here and you tell him where Brad lives, the day before he goes missing? Please tell me you told the police. - I tried to tell him at graduation. Remember that? 'Cause he brushed me off because of you. - That's not what I asked. Did you tell the police? Lizard, did you tell the police? - All right, look Lillian, this business that I run aint exactly legit, all right? I can't have cops just crawling up in here. They start asking questions about where I get my equipment, they probably would've shut me down. - You selfish pig. - Give me a break. You really do think you're so much better than me, don't you? You would have done the same thing. - I would give everything if it meant finding Brad! I swear, if I find out something has happened to him because you lied to the police to protect yourself. - I just told you I didn't tell the police for a reason. Okay? So what do you think you're gonna do about it? - I'm not afraid of you. And Brad wasn't either. That's why you're so ticked off. He was tired of playing your head games and doing your dirty work. And if you ever needed any further affirmation of why Brad chose me over you, I think you just got your answer. I need to speak with Detective Padron. - Hello, Lillian. Is this gonna be a daily thing, now? - I don't know. Well, I mean, no. I guess it just depends on my... - What have you got for me? - I have information that an older man was asking around about where to find Brad the day before he disappeared. - Okay. Who's your source? - Well it's Michael Lizardo. The man came by his shop on Thursday, May 15th and Lizard gave him Brad's address. He told him where he lived. - So you spoke with Mr. Lizardo? - I sort of ran into him. - All right. Did he give you a description of this man? - Yeah. Overweight. I don't know, he said he was an older guy. - Well, you just gave me a description of about half the officers in the precinct. That's not much to go on. Did he give you a description of the vehicle? A license plate? - No. - Maybe his name? - No, I don't know. Lizard said he didn't know the guy. - Okay. You never actually saw this man with Brad, right? Can Mr. Lizardo place him at the graduation ceremony? - Lizard didn't really want to talk to me and he doesn't want to talk to the police either. But that just means he is hiding something. - Okay, I'll give him a call. But without any further information, I hope you understand that this doesn't give me much to work with. I can't exactly put out a BOLO on a nondescript, fat old man who may or may not have wanted to talk with Brad before he went missing. And Lillian, no one reported any suspicious activity outside the Lee household that night, which means we have no reason to believe that this man got Brad's address and then waited for him outside his house. - Okay, but what if he intercepted Brad before he ever got home? Maybe on that stretch of road right past my house enclosed by trees on either side. - We searched that area extensively. No signs of foul play. So, if someone did stop Brad on the way home, maybe he got in the car willingly. - But Brad wouldn't have gotten in the car with some random guy. - If this man knew to go to Mr. Lizardo's shop to look for Brad, then it stands to reason that he wasn't a stranger. Given Brad's past dealings, it's not surprising that someone came looking for him. - Brad doesn't deal drugs. - I will give Mr. Lizardo a call. But I need you to understand that this information is unlikely to change anything in Brad's case. - But Detective. - Kids nowadays, they see an episode of "CSI: Atlanta" or "Law and Whatever" and they get the idea that law enforcement is supposed to be super human like these hokey cops on TV and it's just not the case. Sorry. - Are those your kids, Detective? - Yeah, those are my girls. Becca and Julie. Six and nine. - Mhmm. And what would you do if one of them went missing? - I don't know what I'd do if they went missing. But I'll tell you this. I'll be doing extensive background searches on any prospective boyfriends who come calling, so they're not running around town with juvenile delinquents. - Okay. Well, I'm sorry if you feel like I've wasted your time. - Lillian. Lillian. You're not wasting my time. I just don't wanna see you wasting yours. Lillian. - Hey, Lillian. Hey, it's okay. Come on, let's get out of here. Know any place we could go? - Yeah. I know the perfect place. - This place is incredible. I had no idea this town had something this cool. - This is where we had our last date. The night... You didn't have to bring me here. - No, no, I wanted to. I needed to come here. Honestly, I've been avoiding it all summer. - I came to town today to find you. - You did? - Yeah, I guess I've just been thinking a lot. - About what? - About you. Ever since I saw you that first night, I've wanted to meet you. That's why I was at the party last month and the diner yesterday. Because of you. - I don't understand. - I saw the expression on your face. The look in your eyes and I recognized it. Hurt. Lillian, I've lost someone too. I know what it's like to not have any answers and feel like you've been betrayed. We don't deserve to be hurt by the ones we love. I spent a long time falling into a depression because of everything that happened with my family. I wanted everything to be back the way it used to be. Then one day I realized that no matter what happened, my life would never be the way it was before. Too much damage had already happened. My point is, you never have to stop loving Brad. But please don't let this break you. It's not too late. I promise. - I just need answers. I need to know where he is and why he kept so many things from me. And I want to know who this man is that stopped him the night before graduation. - Man? - Yes. He came to Lizard's the night before Brad disappeared. That's why I went to the police today but they not going to do anything about it. But Lizard said he gave him Brad's address. He told him where lived. The detective said it might not be related but I don't know how it couldn't be related. I mean... What do you think? - I... I don't know. I'm sorry, Lillian. - I don't know either. Story of my life, lately. - I should go. - What? Really? - I'm sorry, I have to get back to Gladeville tonight. - Well, when will you be back? - I'm not sure. Can I walk you into town? - No. I'm gonna stay here a little longer. What's this? - Just something I wanted you to have. It's about coping with grief. I found it in a used bookstore years ago. I don't know if it will help you, but, I found sometimes it's good to mourn someone. Even if they haven't died. - Thanks, Chris. Really. - Goodbye, Lillian. I'm sorry. - For what? ♪ If I could see through your eyes ♪ ♪ And all the beauty I'd find ♪ And just seeing the world ♪ For the first time - Where were you today? - Mom, I was at school. - Lillian, do not lie to me. - I... - Principal Carver called me at the store today to ask if you were all right. I find out not only have you not set foot inside the school doors today, but you left class early yesterday and didn't go back. What's going on with you, Lillian? - Mom, I'm sorry I skipped school. I just, I can't go anywhere in that school without thinking about Brad. - Lillian, you've known going back to school was going to be hard. But it's not optional. And you need to figure out how to deal with it. - But Mom... - You only get one shot at your senior year and if you mess up graduation by slacking off and skipping school, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life. You've already let the entire summer go by without so much as a college tour. And if you had any hopes of being awarded a vocal scholarship... - I know all this, Mom. - Do you? You can not throw your future away because of a boy, Lillian. You're grounded for the rest of the week. I'll drive you to school and you'll go to class, every single one of them. You need to think long and hard about what your future looks like with or without Brad in it. ♪ Lonely bird ♪ I'll keep you company ♪ If I can only hear you sing ♪ Battered heart ♪ Lifts your head to see ♪ If you'd only spread your wings ♪ ♪ You could fly away with me - Can I help you, sweetie? - Sorry, I was just looking for someone. - You're welcome to put up a poster if you can't find your friend. - That won't be necessary. I need Lillian White, it's an emergency. - I'll be right back. What's up? - They... They found a body. - Wait, what? - They found a body of an adult male. - Anna, what are you saying? If you're making this up, it's... - No. Of course not, Lil. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, it's true. - Where did you hear that? - Mrs. Lee was having lunch with my mom when she got the call. My mom said that Mrs. Lee's going down to the police station to talk with the detective. - I feel sick, I gotta get out of here. - Here, just take my car keys. I'm gonna grab my stuff and meet you at the car. Okay. I think I have all my stuff. - Anna? I'm really sorry about everything before... - Don't even worry about it, Lil. It's not important. - I'm having a really hard time with all of this. - I know. I am too. I guess I thought if I ignored it, it wouldn't feel real. But it's so real. I'm so scared. - Me too. - The time of his disappearance. The body was found here, in this isolated wooded area, over a mile and a half from any main roads. The decomposition is advanced, leaving investigators to speculate that the body has been here for some time. - Listen, I'm sorry you had to come down here under these circumstances. We'll run some tests but it will take time. - Thank you. We thank all of you for continuing to support us and pray for Brad's safe return. While we pray that the young man who was discovered is not our son, he is someone's son. We have to have faith in God's plan and trust that the truth will be revealed in His time. - I wish you would have agreed to sing. - No. I couldn't. - I get it. You okay? I'm live from downtown Lions Port as hundreds have turned out for a candlelight vigil... - They never covered Brad's story before. I guess it isn't good news until death is involved. Citizens have gathered here to pray... - Looks like they are finishing up. I'm gonna go say hi to Mr. and Mrs. Lee. The identity of the deceased is hoped to be known in the coming weeks. Yeah, that's okay, you can go talk to her, just stay close. Hi, Lillian. - Hey. Hey, sweetie. How're you doing? I'm okay. - Yeah. Me too. - The candles are pretty. - They are, aren't they? I bet Brad would think they're a little too girly though, don't you think? - I really miss him. - I know. I do too. - Still feels like a real brother to me. - What did you say? - What? - I thought you said... - Montana, come say goodbye to Pastor Allen. - Gotta go. - Come on. - Bye, Lillian. - Yeah, I better get home too. You want a ride? - Yeah, let me just go tell my parents. - Mhmm. Hey. - Chris? - What? No, it's me, Lizard. - What are you doing here? - I saw the news. You know, about the body. - You didn't see the news. You found out when the detective came pounding on your door. - They know I had nothing to do with it. - You missed the vigil tonight. - Yeah. I know, I think the church people don't want me coming around now that this stuff came out about me. - You don't know that. - I messed up. Not tellin' the police about that guy that came lookin' for Brad. I wasn't taking this seriously, okay. I thought you people were making a huge deal out of nothing and then Brad would just come showing back up. But if this... but if this guy they found behind my place is Brad and he's just been there this whole time. You're right. I know why Brad chose you over me. You know I didn't have anything to do with this. Right? - Yeah. I know. - Brad's a good guy and he does not deserve this. - None of us deserve this. - I'm sorry, Lillian. Hope it ain't him. - Thanks, Lizard. I really don't care. Come on mister. I found him out behind your house... - Hello? No, really. - Yes, this is she. Hey guys, turn that down. Aw, shucks. Lillian, this is Detective Padron. Janice Lee requested I call you. - Yes? Has the body been identified? Yes, we were able to confirm the identity based on the dental records. - Is it him? Lillian, it's not him. - It's not him? No, it's not Brad. The body is of another young man who ran away from home. There were drugs found in his system, in fact we're thinking it was a boy from outside. - Thank you, Detective. Thank you for calling. - Why're you crying? Aren't you glad? - Yeah, that's good, isn't it? - Yeah. - We must continue to pray and believe that our prayers can be answered. There is no pain the Lord can't heal, no need He can't fill. Let us pray. - I thought I might find you here. - This was our spot. - I remember. I always knew where to find you two after the service. Are you all right, sweetie? - I just can't listen to promises about prayers being answered and pain being healed. I've been saying the same prayer for four and a half months. What am I doing wrong? - You're not doing anything wrong. You just have to keep believing. - What if I can't anymore? You know, getting Brad to set foot in this church used to be a fight. As he got older, I just stopped trying. Then he started spending time with you and something changed. He was ready to leave his past behind him and start new. Because of you. - His past. Mrs. Lee, was Brad adopted? - He didn't tell you? I'm so sorry, Lillian. It was always a very sensitive subject for him. He was ten when he came to our church in Missouri and he just broke our hearts. We were told his mother was an addict and that she had given him up willingly. She chose her habit over her child. We moved here soon after the adoption was finalized. Brad needed a new start and we chose not to disclose the adoption unless necessary. - But what about his mom? Is there a chance that that's where he is? - The last record of her is from a Missouri jail three years ago. She's practically a missing person too. - We still have no idea what Brad went through before he came to live with us. But he was holding onto a lot of anger. And that anger needed outlets, and those outlets came in the form of theft and vandalism. And then he found you. - What do you mean? - All these things Brad didn't tell you about his past, don't see them as a reflection of how he felt about you. When you came into his life you rescued him from a very troubled path. I just think he didn't want to burden you with the truth about his past. What if it changed how you felt about him, how you saw him? - But it doesn't. - I know that and you know that but maybe it wasn't a risk he was willing to take. You changed his life, and you can do that for so many other people. You continue to see the good when all you hear is bad. No matter what the outcome of this is, please, don't let it break your spirit. Don't lose the faith that brought Brad to you in the first place. - "Even if it's difficult, "you must try to normalize your life as much as you can.

Does he? - He, in fact, does not to the best of my knowledge. Why do you wanna know? Asking for a friend, I assume? No comment. But, in return, I need a favor. - I knew it was too good to be true. - Get the group together tonight. - Sure. What did you have in mind? - I don't wanna say just yet but I wanna go to the lake. - That sounds perfect. - Come on. Thanks for coming tonight, guys. I guess I just wanted to tell you all how much it meant to me the way you instantly accepted Brad into our group of friends. I'll admit, I was afraid that you would freak out and think I was crazy the first time I asked him to have lunch with us, but you didn't. You welcomed him to our table and in no time, it was like he had always been a part of our little group. Like he belonged. And I am sorry that I acted like none of you understood what I was going through when Brad disappeared. I guess I just thought it was just easier to throw myself a pity party and pretend like I was going through it all alone. But this... Brad, I mean, it's affected all of us. I'm ready to stop mourning him and start celebrating his life. Wherever he is. - I must admit, the first day you called me and told me you kissed Brad, I thought you were crazy. But then I met him, like really met him, not just saw him in the halls or heard the rumors about him and... it was obvious what you saw in him. Knowing his reputation around school, I'll be honest, I wasn't sure if it would last. But then he gave you this. What was it, less than a month after you guys started dating? - Three weeks. - Three weeks! And there was no denying that he was crazy about you. There's something special about Brad. - Brad, he's... He's cool and not in the way that we all think we are. But genuinely cool. And he's pretty hot too. No offense, Thomas. - None taken. The first time I met Brad, he completely intimidated me. I can't even lie. I mean, we all heard stories about his shenanigans with Lizard and Jones. I had no idea what he was capable of. And I think at one point he may have been in that group that broke into my house and stole food out of our refrigerator while my family was on vacation. - Yep, that was confirmed. - I knew it. But despite everything I had heard about the guy, I realized within seconds of talking to him that I wanted to be his friend. - I hope Brad knows how much we all cared about him. He does.

Well, yes. - No. No, no. Anna! - What, do you miss me already? - Look, it's from him! It's from Brad, from the night he disappeared. It's been under my window this whole time but it looks likes he taped it to the glass but it must have fallen. - But Lillian, how do you know it's from that night? - Because look. It says, "I love you." - So what do we do? Do we need to take it to the police? - No, we can't take it there. It'll end up in a drawer somewhere. Besides, if I had told the truth about where I last saw him we would have found this months ago. - But Lil, I'm not sure there's much you can do with it if we can't even read what it says. - I know someone who can. - Who? - I don't have time to explain but need your keys. Okay. In 400 feet, turn left. You have arrived at your destination. - Chris? Chris? Chris? Brad? What? What is going on? Chris? - How do you know him? - How do you know him? - Chris, he's my brother. I need to sit down. - Of course. Chris, go inside, check on mom. - What does this say? Please tell me that this note explains everything and that you didn't just take off and leave me and everyone else. - It explains some things. Yeah. - Then tell me, please. Where are we? What is going on and why are you and Chris... Why did Chris... - This house belongs to my uncle. My mom's brother. My biological mom. I never told you but... - You were adopted. I know. Montana told me in one way or another. There's a lot of things you didn't tell me that I had to find out from other people or from the police. - I'm so sorry. - So what does it all mean? - Mom's sick, Lil. Like, really sick. She's been trying to find me and my uncle found my graduation announcement online. That night, after I was at your house, he stopped me on the road and he asked me if I wanted to see my mom. - So then what? You got in the car and never looked back? - No, no, I... I never intended to leave the way I did. It was never supposed to be for more than a day or two. - Well then what happened? - I panicked. Seeing my mom, talking to her, getting to know her again. I didn't know how I could leave her. She's not the same person she was when I was a kid. Mom's liver is failing, Lil. She's dying. She's been looking for me because she needed me to forgive her for giving me up. She needed to find me before it was too late. And deep down, I knew I needed to find her to forgive her, too. Despite everything that's happened, everything she's put me through, I still love her. You know what that's like? - What about your family? The family that raised you. Why didn't you just pick up the phone and explain to them what was happening? - I wanted to tell my family but what would they think? What was I supposed to say? They had lined up a perfect future for me, with a great job and I was supposed to start school in the fall with all the money they saved me for so long. I know it sounds like excuses but what was I supposed to tell them? That I was willing to give all of that up for a woman that abandoned me when I was ten years old? - And what was your excuse for not telling me? - I tried. I taped this to your window, I thought you'd see it in the morning. It says, "I have to go away for a little while. "I'm sorry, but please don't worry. "I hope you know how much I love you." - Five months is not a little while, Brad. That's a long, long time. - I know, I'm sorry. I didn't think this through. It all just kinda happened. It's like I couldn't just leave and tell you where I was going without telling you everything about me. - Why not just tell me the truth? - I was afraid. I was afraid of what you'd think about me if you knew the truth. - I was afraid! I was afraid you were dead or kidnapped! - I know, Lillian, everything's gonna be okay. - No, nothing is okay. I'm not okay. I haven't been okay since the morning I found out you were gone. No, not gone, missing. They found a body that was checked against your dental records, Brad. They pulled DNA off your toothbrush. - I had no idea. - What did you think was happening? Did you think everyone just accepted the fact that you were gone and moved on? I spent five months searching for your corpse in ditches and dumpsters, attending prayer vigils, and questioning everything I believe in, practically yelling at God because I didn't understand how He could ever let that happen to me. And all because you couldn't just tell me the truth. - I'm so, so sorry, Lillian. I don't know what else to say. - It wouldn't have mattered. I didn't care about who you were before me. All I cared about was who you were when we were together. Come back with me. - I can't, Lil. - What do you mean, you can't? - My mom, she doesn't have much time left. But you can visit me anytime and we'll still be together. - This isn't just about me, Brad. Your family, they need to see you too. Wait. You're not asking me to pretend like you're still missing, are you? Is that what you're asking me to do? I have to go. Don't go. Lil. - No. Lillian, please. I love you. I've loved you this entire time. - Stop! Stop saying you love me if that's how you're gonna show it. I can't lie to my friends and family and pretend like I don't know where you are. If you really loved me, you wouldn't ask me to do that. - You just don't understand, I can't leave her now. - You're right, I don't understand. Brad, I have been defending you to the police, my parents, our friends, practically the entire town, from the very first day you disappeared and I swore to myself that you would never have just left me, even after I found out everything about your past. And I was willing to look like a fool for not knowing so many things about you because I loved you despite... - I love you too, I never stopped. - I'm not finished. How can I keep loving you when I feel like I don't even know you anymore? The truth is that everyone else was right. You chose to leave. You chose to leave me. - It's not like that, you know it's not. - I'm not gonna lie to everybody. They deserve the truth just like I do and if you're not gonna tell them, I will. - Just please give me some time to think about this. - What is there to think about? - My mom abandoned me when I needed her most, Lil. I'm not gonna do the same to her. - What do you think you did to me? - No. Goodbye, Brad. - Don't! Lil, please! Lil, don't go!

What are you doing here? - I owe you an explanation. - Come on. - I really did know what you were going through. When we were kids and Mom couldn't take care of us, she sent me to live with my uncle. But he didn't have enough room for Brad and before I knew it she had given him up and he was gone. I spent the last eight years wondering what where my brother was, never knowing if he was safe or even alive. I hadn't seen him until Uncle Jack showed up that night with him at our house. - The night of graduation. - My mom got out of jail three years ago and decided she wanted to be sober. Been looking for him ever since. - How did you find out about me? - Are you kidding me? Brad couldn't stop talking about you, telling Mom all about how incredible you were and how you were the best thing that ever happened to him. Everything that's been going on with our mom has put him in a really tough spot. He didn't mean for things to happen the way they did. - I know. - I didn't either. - Chris, I don't blame you for anything. Really. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have believed you even if you told me the truth. And anyway, I should be thanking you. - For what? - See? You did tell me about Brad in one way or another. Does he know you're here? - No way. He probably thinks I took off to avoid him kicking my butt once he found out I had been sneaking down here to see you. That's the other reason I left. Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah. Once I redefine the meaning of okay. Dear Brad, I thought your disappearance had broken me. But now I realize that you were broken long before I was. While I saw you as my rock, you were the one who was crumbling beneath me. It hurts me that I didn't see it. But I think what hurts me more than anything is that you didn't want me to know the truth about your past. There is nothing that you could have told me about yourself that would have made me love you less. Knowing the truth would have only made me love the person that you have become even more. I naiïvely thought that who we were before we were together didn't matter but I was wrong. I lost part of myself while I was looking for you and now I have to re-discover who I was before you to figure out who I am without you. But I will never stop praying for you. I'll always remember you and I'll always love you.
