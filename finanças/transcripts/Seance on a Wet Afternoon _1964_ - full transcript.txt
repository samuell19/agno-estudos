What? What, what is it? No no no, no. Please, not now. A message? Yes. It's a young face. He's waving. Peaceful. Oh very peaceful. Oh no no no, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh. Hush. No my darling. It's all right my precious, no. No more, no more. Naughty, raining like that. Very naughty. Turn on the light Billy. Put the thing up. Yes. We shall have to test it from the outside tonight. Of course it's not what it used to be. Not his room any longer. But Arthur understands. We're doing it with his blessing. That's just how he put it! He said, "You have my blessing." Comfy little bed this. I remember when I slept in it. Very comfy. You never slept in that bed. Yes I did dear, that time you were ill, remember. No I don't remember. No well, it's not important dear. What you say Billy, what anybody says is important. This was always Arthur's bed. Till he went to school. I've never allowed anybody to sleep in it. Yes of course dear. Well she'll be nice and comfy in this. What. What does it look like? Very neat. No no, I mean what does it all look like. The overall effect. If you'd never seen it before and you suddenly woke up in that bed, where would you think you were. In a hospital. Yes! Exactly in hospital. Aren't we the clever ones! It's going to work Billy. The plan's going to work. Yes? Perfect. Did you put the extra strong bulb in? Yes. The 150 watt. Well you saw me put it in. Good. It's fine then. I couldn't see anything. Look at the dust in this place, have you seen the dust. I thought old Mother Jackson was supposed to have done this out before she went on holiday. Well we can live with it. I can't live with it. I hate dust. Oh it's lovely for her, she's on abroad this year you know. I said to her "Where are you going for your holidays "this year Mrs Jackson?" I felt sorry for her, I thought she'd be stuck at Margate or somewhere, getting her usual third degree burn. Not a bit of it. "We're going to France," she said, "in my Cyril's new car." You can imagine that can't you. Five of them crammed in the Mini with her Cyril at the wheel. A nightmare. Still it suits our purposes. The further away the better till it's all over, hmm. You want that on do you? Yes. It helps me to concentrate. Of course it'd be a marvellous opportunity not to have her back. I mean we're not giving up a treasure or anything like that. She only does it for the gossip. And we can do without that. According to the directions it takes a couple of hours. So we might as well make a start. You think we ought to start now do you. Yes. That's what I just said. Put the scissors down will you. You can finish that later. Well we're not having any last minute doubts are we Billy. You know it's too late for that. We have to go through with it, exactly as planned. Now's the only time, with Mrs Jackson safely away. Yes, I know. ♪ For the wings of a dove ♪ You want that car don't you Billy. You know the one you saw. You want things to be different, not only for me but for all of us. I'm not doing it for the car. The car isn't why I'm doing it. Listen Billy. Listen will you. Carefully. You know that I can never tell when you're really listening to me. And try to understand, Billy what I am, what I am can't just be thrown away can it. And it's not wrong. What we're going to do is not wrong. We're doing it for his sake. Arthur wants me to be recognised for what I am. I mean I can't tell you. He convinced me. I had to be convinced myself before I told you. I mean I know it's different for you. I've know that all along and I do try to make... It's so quiet in here. Suddenly so terribly quiet. Did you turn that off? No dear, you did it yourself. I did, I turned, I wanted it on, why would I turn it off. Well then it must've been me. Why did I ever marry you Billy? I don't know dear, why did you. Because you're weak and because you need me. Well those are two good reasons. We've had so much sorrow Billy. Too much sorrow. But it's all going to be changed now. Everything's going to be different. You know what I sometimes wish? I sometimes wish I were ordinary like you. Dead ordinary. Ordinary and dead like all the others. Too much sorrow Billy. And you can't buy your own happiness at the expense of somebody else's unhappiness. Who was it that said that? Do you know? Yes. Who? Arthur said it. Oh yes. Of course. Fancy you remembering. He didn't say it to you did he? No dear. You told me. Oh yes. Funny he's never been close to you. Not that I blame you. It's easier for me. You don't have my gift. It all might've been different if Mummy hadn't left me this house. She wanted me to have it. They read it out. The solicitor read it out of the will. He sat just there. We've never really quarrelled have we, except about this house. Have you ever thought of that? Yes I've thought about it dear. Still I have made it up to you in other ways, haven't I. Yes lots of ways. And you do need me, don't you. Well say it then. I don't have to say it. I wouldn't be here would I, if I didn't. No, but I do think you had second thoughts just now. Not that I mind, I mean I understand. It's not easy for you. But you did have second thoughts didn't you Billy. Well not second thoughts as such, no. Well what then? Well. As you said, I don't have your gift. Yes. You're right. I do keep forgetting that. You see when they first found out, when I was little, you remember I told you about my aunt. She was the first one. She knew. She'd tumbled it. She used to go on endlessly to Mummy in this room. I used to hear them. I used to creep to the top of the stairs to listen. And then at Sunday tea all the family came and I had to perform. I had to get up and do my party piece. And in the end I began to enjoy it. To look forward to it. It was nice being different. I mean you didn't get told off, you just had all the nice things, all the. You see, it wasn't a trick. It was there all those years ago, here in this room. And it was real. It was happening to me. I didn't have to make it up. Don't you see. That's why, that's why it has to happen Billy. Otherwise what's it all been for. Just to take a collection every Wednesday afternoon, rain or fine. I mean eight pounds ten in a biscuit tin. No, no. It has to be more than that Billy, it has to be. And Arthur's quite certain is he. If you're ready. Well then. I mustn't disappoint him. Must I? Excuse me, are you Mr Clayton's chauffeur? Yes. The headmistress, Miss Bray, she's got a letter for you to give to Mr Clayton. Oh thank you. No no I haven't got it. She wanted to give it to you in person. Oh right. See you in a tick Amanda. Open the door, there's a good girl. Come on be a good girl, open it up. I won't hurt you, I promise. It's only a game, I promise. Cross my heart, it's only a game. It must be out here somewhere. I know. Where is it? Hey, here. - Thanks Mister! - Thanks Mister. Well play further away next time, you'll hit someone. - All right! - All right. Don't be afraid dear. Don't be afraid. It's only a game. I think it needs one more good rinse. Can you manage? Yes thank you. I'll just go have another look at her. I've had another look at her. She's still all right. Well don't fuss. The worst thing you can do with children is to fuss. It confuses them. Read this to me will you. I want to hear how it sounds. Use this in case we want to make corrections. You want me to read it out loud do you? Yes. Well could we have that a little quieter please? Oh Billy, I do wish you weren't such a bore about good music. Dear sir. This is to notify you that your... Uh-uh. That's not a good start. Too formal. Cross it out. We don't need an introduction. Oh. This is to notify you that your daughter is in our possession. She is quite safe and if you follow instructions she will remain safe. By this time you will have informed the police, that was to be expected, but do not tell them about this letter. Oh full stop after letter. Do not tell them about this letter. Destroy it. We are professionals and we mean business. You will find enclosed a lock of your daughter's hair as proof. Wait, um, change that. Lock means curl. Make it piece, her hair's straight. Or just some. Piece. Piece. I enclose a piece of your daughter's hair as proof. Your instructions are as follows, full stop. One. You will put an advert into the personal column of tomorrow's Evening Standard to the effect that you are willing to oblige and sign, willing to oblige and sign it with your Christian name. Good. This advert you will address to Longfellow. Full stop. Two. You will get a blue BOAC overnight bag and put into it £25,000. You will be informed later by telephone where and when you are to deliver the money. After delivery your daughter will be returned unharmed but if these instructions are not followed perfectly or if there is any attempt to detain the man to whom. That doesn't have an E does it. What? Whom. No. You've got one. If there's any attempt to detain the man to whom you will give the money, you will never see your daughter alive again. Signed Longfellow. Well I suppose we need that last bit do we. Yes we need it. Even though we don't mean it. Even though we don't mean it, they have to believe we mean it. Yes I suppose the truth of the matter is I haven't taken it in yet. What we've done. Well what have we done? We've borrowed a child, that's what we've done. They have another word for it. We have borrowed a child Billy. Borrowed, borrowed. Just keep saying that. Now get on with your letter. I'll be back down shortly. Very good Billy. It won't be a joke anymore will it. Once you've posted it. It never was a joke Billy. No but you know what I mean. Once you post it no one else is going to use the word borrow. Oh Billy. How many times must I tell you. What we're doing is a means to an end. Now you agree with the end don't you. Well then you must agree with the means. You can't have one without the other. Burn these after I leave. But we're not going to keep the money and the child won't be hurt in any way. No. Except if it goes wrong, who's going to believe that. I mean we can't expect anybody to believe the real reason. The trouble is Billy you lack imagination. You miss all the good things in life just because you won't reach that bit further to touch the truth. Say you love me. I love you. And you couldn't live without me could you. I mean you tried it once and you had to come back and I took you back, didn't I. And you made me a promise, remember. You promised me. Yes. I promised you. Go on, post your letter. And come back safely. Say come back safely. And come back safely. Oh God, oh Jesus, take her before it's too late. Girl missing. Where, oh. "The only daughter of Charles Clayton, "wealthy chairman of Clayton Industries Limited "was last night stated to be missing from home." It doesn't say much does it. They never do at first, that doesn't worry me. I want it to start slowly. You get her breakfast, I'll change. Good morning Amanda. How are you feeling this morning, a bit better? Just going to take your temperature and then you can have your breakfast. Who are you? Nice scrambled eggs, and we don't want them to get cold do we. Lie back and open your mouth. I want to know who you are first. I'm your nurse. What nurse? Nurse Johnson. Under the tongue. There. No talking now. You're in hospital. Ever been in hospital before? Well then you'll know how to behave. You didn't take that long enough. Didn't I? No, Doctor Loxton takes ages. Why am I in hospital? Why? Yes. Caroline says you only go to hospital to die. Who's Caroline? My best friend. Well Caroline is just being silly. No she isn't, she's very clever. She's a Christian Scientist. Oh is she. There we are. What have I got? German measles. Had it. Oh no, this is a very special kind. Double German measles. Very catchy. Is it very special? Mm, very. That's why you've got a room to yourself. I was at school, I wasn't ill. Yes you were. You were sent home from school, don't you remember. Now eat your breakfast. Why have you got that on your face? I have to wear it in case I catch your measles. You eat it up. You didn't tell her she'd be going, you didn't tell her she'd be going home soon. I think you ought to tell her that. I thought you were gonna tell her that right away. Well I forgot. You know with children you have to tell them. Set their little minds at rest right away. Billy what do you know about children. They're really quite adaptable, children. They're like little animals. You know how animals look in the pet shop, in the windows. When you see them they, you take them home and you feed them and they adapt in a matter of hours. Billy. Yes dear, you're right I'm sure. Well you remember what Arthur was like at her age. I mean they're quite pleased to be sick. Makes them feel different and important. Billy. I wonder could you help me. Do you know where a Mr and Mrs Clayton live? In what connection is it madam? I want to see Mr Clayton. Do you have an appointment? No I don't. Well this is the house but I don't think Mr Clayton can see you. It's not official business is it. No. But I really do think he would see me if he knew what I'd come about. What have you come about then? Something that vitally concerns him at this moment. Well I'll ask up at the house. Come with me. Hey Miss! I'd like to see Mr Clayton for a minute please Miss. We'll just have to cancel, that's no problem surely. Thank you Karla. Yes officer, what is it now. I'm sorry to trouble you again sir but I believe this lady has some information regarding... This is my card Mr Clayton. Who is it darling? Look I don't know sweetie. I'm just finding out. All right officer, I'll deal with this. Perhaps you better hang on a moment will you. Karla will you ask Mrs Miles, oh it's all right. Mrs Miles, will you get the constable a cup of coffee please. Would you like one darling? No. Will you come this way Mrs Savage. Oh I'm so sorry. Darling this is Mrs Savage, my wife. In here. No I'm sorry, that's all I have to say. Who was that? Nothing Mr Clayton, just another newspaper. Get me some cigarettes Sheila, will you. Couple of packets, box of 100, anything. Oh I'm sorry, sit down. Yes Mrs Savage, what information do you have. Well I'm afraid I don't have anything definite, that is definite to you. But I read the papers this morning and I felt I must come. You see last night I had a dream. A dream? Yes. Mrs Savage. I don't want to be rude but we've been up all night. I'm sure you came here with the best of intentions but we've had offers of help from other people like yourself. We had a man in here half an hour ago who offered to find our daughter with the aid of a divining rod, you do see don't you. Yes of course, but there is a difference. You see I am a professional medium and my dreams are not without significance. What sort of dream was it? I saw a little girl sitting alone. She was lost. I was quite sure she was lost. Of course that in itself wouldn't mean much but the symbolism was very strong. Symbolism? Yes. The little girl was surrounded by clay. Wet clay. And when I read your name in the papers I coupled it with the clay. I see. Darling you don't have any cigarettes do you. No, no I haven't. And that means something does it, Mrs Savage. Oh yes. Yes the connection between the clay and your name was too strong to ignore. Was that all? No. The child in my dream used some names. Names? Yes. She said Caroline first of all. That's her best friend at school. Yes well she kept saying that. And then just before my dream ended she said hedge. Could that mean anything? Yes Hedgey, that's her toy. Well it's a sort of funny old hedgehog all falling to pieces. She won't ever sleep without it. Well it must be that, mustn't it darling. You see she had it with her when, well she'd taken it to school with her. It's something to go on isn't it. Nothing else Mrs Savage. No just those three things. Mrs Savage. You are a professional medium are you? Yes. Darling what do you think we ought to do. Now just a moment sweetie. Mrs Savage. Again I don't want to appear rude or ungrateful. But what you've just told us you could've learned by accident or by half a dozen other different ways. People gossip. I have a staff, they gossip. You could've read about it in a magazine. They're always writing things about my wife. Anyway you could've come by this information in a dozen different ways. Yes but the point is that I didn't. I had a dream. The point is Mrs Savage, and forgive me I don't know why you came to see me and not the police. If your dream means so much, and presumably you think it does, I find it very odd that you didn't go to the police first. Now let me ask you question Mrs Savage. What do you want out of it? - Darling. - I'm sorry? Well what's in it for you? You must have some angle. You think I'm after money? Well it's possible isn't it. Eh? People do do things for money, it has been known. I'm so sorry. I'm obviously wasting your time, but I do understand. Goodbye Mrs Clayton and don't worry. I know your little girl is safe. You don't know anything of the kind so don't give my wife any false hopes. I'll tell you something that wasn't in your dream Mrs Savage, and I might just as well tell you because it'll be in the papers any moment. Our little girl has been kidnapped, she's being held for ransom. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. No no exactly, thank you for coming. Yes, speaking. I'm terribly sorry Mrs Savage. It's just that we're both so worried. No I've got - nothing to say! - Although I do think the fact that they've got in touch with us means that she's safe, don't you. I mean they usually do this sort of thing for the money, don't they. Nothing else. I'm quite sure she'll be all right and I do understand your husband not having time for me. No nothing! But I'm never wrong about these things. Thank you very much for coming. Anything helps at the moment. Oh Sheila, will you show Mrs Savage out. Thank you. Look if I get one more call from you I'll have the phone disconnected. What about those bastards darling? They wanna take a picture of you and me in her bedroom. What with them and that phoney bitch and her stupid dreams, I've just about had enough. Yes. Well I don't care about any of them really. I don't care what pictures they take or who finds her. Just as long as we get her back. Excuse me ma'am. Excuse me. I wonder if I could trouble you for one of those cards. I'm sorry? Your name and address ma'am. I'm supposed to make a note of everybody who comes and goes. Oh yes, of course. It's purely for the record. Thank you. Oh by the way, those blokes hanging about the gate. Reporters. Take my tip and walk right past. You don't wanna get mixed up with them. Oh no, of course not. Thank you for telling me. I'll use the other gate. She wants some cocoa and some potato crisps. We haven't got any have we. We have cocoa. What about crisps? Listen. Turn out the light. - Nothing. - Try and knock then. That's the garage door. Is it locked? Yes. What about the back door though, supposing they go round the back? Go and make sure. Be careful. Doctor! Nurse! Nurse I want you! Nurse! Doctor! Nurse! Nurse I want you! It's all right. It's all right. Go and see what she wants. And put your mask on. I'll get her drink ready. It slipped off. Oh dear. Well accidents will happen. I thought perhaps you'd fallen out of bed. The nurse is just making your drink. Did you enjoy your dinner? I don't like eating in bed. You get all crumbs. Yes I've found that. Are you really a doctor? Yes of course. You don't smell like a doctor. Don't I? Well what do doctors smell like? All pepperminty. Well we'll have to do something about that then won't we. Nurse'll be up in a tick. You'll be all right. What was it? Oh she just dropped her tray. She's really bright you know, really quite bright. What about the police, will they be back? Yes but not tonight. Watch that will you, it's about to boil. Well they must suspect something. Everyone's under suspicion once they've made contact. I knew they'd call. They were just a little more efficient than I'd imagined, that's all. I'm not ready for that. I think we should take her back now, tonight, while there's still time. Oh I need some sugar. Did you hear what I said? Sugar, sugar. Look it's not going to work. If we do something now we might just get away with it. What would we get away with Billy? Nothing. We'd just be taking all the risks with none of the benefits. Myra. We, I committed a criminal act. I kidnapped her, I didn't borrow her. And they're onto us. They made a call, that's all. Part of a routine investigation. If they'd had any strong suspicions they never would've left so easily, now would they. But they'll be back, you said so yourself. Yes they'll be back, but not tonight. They won't be back tonight. First thing tomorrow morning, what difference does it make. A great deal of difference Billy. She won't be here tomorrow morning. Billy what was our plan? Our beautiful perfect plan. How brave, how excited we were. Don't you remember conceiving it? Have you forgotten Billy? We were going to do something so perfect, so pure, that would harm no one. It would only do good. And we've made a start, a wonderful start. It's all going exactly as we said. And when we've done the rest, when we've got the ransom money and it's all over the front pages, that's when it can all come true for us Billy. I'll make it come true. I'll tell them where she can be found and where the money is hidden. Well I have to do this little lie Billy so they can know the whole truth. That's what you want, isn't it. That's what you've always wanted, ever since. Well ever since I can remember. You've wanted nice things for me, haven't you. That's true isn't it. Yes that's true dear. So you know what you have to do tonight. Just as we rehearsed it. Yes, Barnet three. Charles Clayton here. This is Longfellow. Keep him talking as long as you can. Yes, yes I'm here. Where's my little girl? What have you done with my baby? Please tell me she's all right. Hello? Hello! Yes, well, listen carefully. Yes yes, I'm listening. Have you got the money ready? - Yes. - In the BOAC bag? Yes. Then listen to me. Go alone to Leicester Square to the phone box nearest to the taxi rank, in the northwest corner. Yes sir. Yes. Keep him talking, - they're tracing it. - Hello, are you listening? Yes yes, I'm listening, yes. Go inside it and wait there. Don't do anything. Don't use the phone. Just go inside and wait there. Have you got all that? Yes. Would you repeat that last part again please? Northwest corner, last booth. - Northeast? - West, west! I've said it three times. Have you got it now? Yes. Well that's all then. Wait! Don't hurt my baby. About bleedin' time an' all. Where to? That could've been fatal if I hadn't made you turn your pockets out. You know that, don't you. Yes, I'm not a master criminal you know. Is it clear outside? Yes absolutely, shall I take her. No I can manage, you take care of those. You sure she won't wake up. She couldn't possibly. I've been thinking. What if the police haven't been by the time I get back? What? Oh. Yes that is something. Well we'd better have a signal then. I'll hang a shirt on the line and leave it there until the police have been and gone. Yes, right. If it's still there keep driving round and coming back to check. - Right. - Otherwise, stick exactly to the plan. Yes. Yes? I'm a police officer, Detective Sergeant Beedle. Could I have a word with you Mrs Savage? Well yes, of course. Won't you come in. Excuse me. Please. We called last night but you were out I think. Oh yes we were. It's not about the radio licence is it. No it's nothing like that. No it's nothing at all really. It's just a check. It's in connection with that little girl missing from Barnet. After your visit yesterday the police at Barnet asked us to check, character and so on. I was able to tell them that you weren't known officially to us, et cetera, and that was all above board. But they asked if we'd just have a look round the house. He doesn't work in this area, does he. Your husband. He doesn't work at all I'm afraid. He suffers from ill health. Oh yes. I remember my wife mentioning it. Asthma isn't it. Yes. Sometimes it's worse than others. This isn't your room I take it. No, my husband's. He sometimes uses it when he gets an attack. It's fairly dust free. Right. This is where I hold my meetings. Do you, yes. Well I'm not taking sides one way or the other. I keep out of it where my wife's concerned. Still I suppose there's something in it. I think so. Well you would of course, yeah. What about Mr Savage? Does he go along? He believes in what I believe. What does your husband drive, a Mini? No a, just an old motorbike. It's William Savage, isn't it. William Henry. Oh yes. My wife was trying to remember. How is she? She's all right I think, none the worse. A bit hot perhaps. I kept looking at her whenever I could. You weren't followed were you? No I doubled back a couple of times just in case. Hot you say. Yes, nothing much. No but you said hot. You hid the money did you? Yes but what do you mean hot? What I said Billy, what I said. A bit hotter than usual, that's all. Yes but what does that mean! It means, and do not shout at me, that she has a bit of a temperature I suppose. It's nothing unusual in children. How would you know? We're mad you and me. We're both mad. Are you asleep? Myra are you asleep? What is it? Come in here a minute. What's wrong? Well come and look at her. With my uniform on? It doesn't matter she, look, just come and look. You feel her forehead. Now tell me that's normal. Yes she is still very hot. Well of course she's hot. I took her temperature, it's way up. Get another blanket there. We'll have to get a doctor. Billy don't be stupid. What do you mean don't be stupid? Where are you going? What's stupid about it? The child's ill and we've got to have a doctor. Look don't walk away when I'm talking to you. What are you doing, I'm telling you what we've got to do. We've got to get a doctor. Look put that down and listen to me for a minute. What are you looking in here for, you won't find the answer in a book. I'm telling you what the answer is. Are you Billy, are you? You know the answer, it's that simple is it. We just call the doctor. Now what should we say to him do you think. Should we say that we've borrowed a, oh you don't like that word do you. We'll say we've kidnapped a child and ask him to treat it in confidence. Is that what we should do Billy? And we don't really know if there's anything wrong at all, do we. We'll get medicine for her in the morning. There's no harm that can come to her in a warm bed is there. I don't know. I don't know anything any longer. Except you do know I'm right, don't you. That I'm right. Now we have to take turns to sit in with her. You want to take the first turn or shall I? I'll take it. Billy? Billy! What is it? The mother's disappeared. We can't hold your meeting this afternoon. You must put it off. I'm giving half the adult dose, do you think that's all right. Once every four hours, that means one now Myra. and one at 2:30. Myra we must put it off. The very worst thing we could do is change the normal routine. But the baby'll be in the next room. That's right Billy, and you'll sit with her after you've got everyone in. We're not going to put it off Billy. It would just make people suspicious. I'm not putting it off. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Will you go up please. Excuse me. Oh good afternoon. Good afternoon. Is Mrs Savage holding her usual meeting this afternoon? Oh yes, why don't you come in please. Thank you. You haven't been before, have you. No, no I haven't. May I have your name please. Clayton. Mrs Clayton. Upstairs. The room's upstairs. Oh, thank you. Straight ahead. Yes I've just seen her. I thought she might come. But you can't with the child in here, you just can't. Oh yes Billy, yes. Oh it's good that she's come, don't you see. It's good. It strengthens my connection, now I can help her. I can help her Billy. Now she can share my truth. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Shall we make our circle? What? What, what is it? He had a car. A red car. Going over a bridge. Going home. Happy. Oh they're all singing. He sends his love. That's my Fred, that's my darling. Take good care of all at number 43. I will, I will my darling. We put flowers on your grave last Sunday, me and the girls. Somebody else. Worried. Somebody on my left. Your guardian angel has put candles on both your knees. One on each knee. A white one on the left and a blue one on the right. He's telling you not to worry. Mummy. You are worried about a church. No. About a child. Mummy! You're worried about a little girl. Mummy. Oh yes. No need to worry. No need. She's quite safe. She's being taken care of by three, three people who are concerned about her future happiness. Mummy. Oh she's playing, she's happy. All the future is happiness. - Mummy. - Ssh, ssh. When, when will I see her again? What is it Arthur, what? Well say it then, what. Please. When will I see her? Mummy. Please. When? Not another, no! What is it dear? Die. It's all right, she'll be all right in a minute. It's all right dear, you're all right. You fainted. Silly me. I fainted. That's very silly of me. Yes just sit quietly for a minute. I think perhaps we'll stop it here for today. Yes yes, of course Mr Savage. If someone could perhaps help me I'll get her to her room. Yes yes, of course. Let me. Mr Savage, who is going to die. Die? Yes you said the word who was it for. Was it to do with me? Nobody's dead. No not dead, die. I distinctly heard you say it. No, nobody's dead. Look if you don't mind Mrs Wintry, please. I'll just see them out dear. You sure you'll be all right? Yes I'm fine. I'm fine. I do apologise. Please accept my wife's apologies. She's overtired I think. Oh yes, yes of course. What do I owe Mrs Savage? Oh nothing, nothing please. But I must. Well I'll send her something through the post. Please, I assure you. Oh no, I'd like to. You see I am so worried and she has given me some hope. Whatever my wife told you I'm sure will come true. You will thank her for me won't you. Yes of course. Billy. Billy I've got something to tell you. Something tremendous to tell you. Come in here. Oh there you are. I was just going to call you again. Isn't it a wonderful afternoon. I'm always so surprised. So bright after a seance. Brightness just seems to fall from the air. Have you noticed? Yes. No. You don't notice. Yes I do. What is it you want to tell me? Arthur was very close this afternoon. He was so close, he kept talking about love, that was the word he used. He was chattering on, I couldn't keep up with him. He so wants her to be happy. Her? Yes, the child. He's grown so fond of her since she's been using his room. That's what gave him the idea. Idea, what idea. Well it's very simple really and as Arthur says, it's the answer for all of us. And for the plan. He says she doesn't really want to go back. He says she'd be much happier with him. Then they'd have to take notice of me wouldn't they. I mean they couldn't ignore me if we do what he says. It'd make the whole thing that much more important. And he kept saying how much happier she'd be if we sent her to him. Myra. Arthur didn't say anything. You said it, it was you, it's what you've been thinking. - Didn't say... - It's you, it's all you. Well of course he said it. - Why wouldn't... - Arthur doesn't exist! He's never existed. He was dead, he didn't live. He was dead Myra, he was born dead. You never saw him, I was the only one who saw him. They wouldn't let you see him. It's you Myra, it's always been you. No. Yes it has, - it's what you want. - No! - No! - Yes, this last thing was you! You thought of it. - No no! - You're the one who wanted her to die. You thought of it, it's only in your mind. That's not true, you mustn't say that, that is not true. Arthur is dead! You always wanted him so much but he's dead. All those clothes you've got upstairs in the room, that's in your mind too. You don't have to say it. Yes, yes I have to say it! And you have to hear me. This time you have to hear me! - He's... - Say it, Arthur is dead. He was born dead. - Billy please. - Go on, say it! Say it! No! I know he's dead, I know that, I do know that. But I do talk to him. And he does talk to me, please don't make me say he doesn't talk to me, please. I do and I see him. I am different and I do see him. That's why I want her. She makes me feel so much closer to him. That's why Billy. Billy? Oh Myra. Oh Myra, what to do now. It's what I have to think about, what to do now. I have to think, I have to think. Billy. Myra don't say anymore. Just let me think. Billy please. Just do this for me so I can keep her. It wouldn't be fair to take away from me now. Mummy! You go back to bed. You'll catch cold. What were they all shouting about? Well it was just a game. This isn't really a hospital is it. Hospitals are all white. You stay in bed this time like a good girl. You'll be home soon, I promise. I must've left her door unlocked. Yes Billy. Rushing in to see you. Yes Billy. She's seen you Billy. She's seen your face. Do it for me Billy. Then we can both be safe forever. You see how easy it was Billy. She didn't suffer, she didn't feel anything. She just went to sleep. Now she's safe with Arthur. You don't want me to say that anymore do you. But I won't. I promise you I won't. Because of all the things you've done for me. Billy look at me. I won't ever forget. Just a few more hours and I'll go and tell them where they can find her. And it'll all come true. Just as Mummy said. Are you cold? You look cold. It's always cold in this room isn't it. Even in the afternoons when the sun comes in. Never really warms it up. Billy we won't stay here once it's over. Once it's over we'll go away. You'd like that wouldn't you. We'll never quarrel again. I'll just do things to please you. Say you love me. You know I love you. I want to read over exactly what it is I want to say. That's the evening papers, would you get it Billy. She was. ♪ Oh for the wings, for the wings of a dove ♪ ♪ Far away, far away would I rove ♪ ♪ Oh for the wings, for the wings of a dove ♪ ♪ Far away, far away, far away, far away would I rove ♪ This is Superintendent Walsh. Superintendent Walsh. Good evening Mrs Savage. Very sorry to call on you like this without warning. Oh well, that's quite all right. You know Sergeant Beedle I believe. Yes, good evening Mrs Savage. Yes we had a long talk a few days ago. Yes, well, as a matter of fact that's why I'm calling on you. Once again this is not an official visit as such. We just thought perhaps you might be able to help us a little further, in your professional capacity. I'm sorry, I. The little girl missing from Barnet. You gave the parents some information I believe. Yes that's right, I... Before I go any further Mrs Savage I think I ought to say that off duty I'm not a non-believer. Matter of fact I'm president of my local society for psychical research. Oh are you? How very interesting. Yes it is, very. I'm a very keen president. I've had one or two papers published. Nothing much, just our own magazine, and mostly concerned with the Kroner experiments. Oh. Oh yes. Of course, I know the Kroner experiments. As I'm sure you know they followed them up in Austria with startling results. I went into it when I was there on holiday last year. Rather a busman's holiday I suppose but I like to get to the end of things. That's why I'm here. I wondered if you would consider holding a seance for me. Here? This evening? Well if it's at all possible. We seem to have drawn a blank with orthodox methods and since you did make contact before you might be a great help again. Of course it's only a request, you're quite at liberty to refuse. What help do you think my wife could give you? Well in a case like this Mr Savage we are grateful for small mercies. And since your wife does appear to have powers beyond the ordinary, I'd like to make use of them. You already enjoy a very considerable reputation Mrs Savage. Do I? Oh yes, indeed. News in our particular circle, if I may put it like that, may not travel widely, but it travels very surely. You want me to give you exact information about the little girl, is that it. Well it doesn't have to be exact Mrs Savage. Just a clue, that's all we're looking for. And you want to have the seance now? If that's at all possible. Speaking as a policeman now, time isn't exactly on our side. Well I usually have a circle. Yes, well, I thought we'd ask Beedle here and Mr Savage. Oh my husband isn't a regular sitter. Well I don't think that matters. I'd like him to be in on this one. Will you excuse me a moment? Do you suppose you can get the station on the car radio from here? Well I can't say for certain sir. You don't know. I'm not positive. But do you think it's possible? Well yes. I couldn't say for sure sir. Right, you wait outside. So sorry. Right Mrs Savage, if you'll show us where. Yes. This way please. Billy. Oh I haven't got a match. Match. Will a lighter do? Yes please. Would you turn out the light? Superintendent there, Billy over there. Mr Beedle. Is there anything special you want us to do? No. It's a great help to me if we all give ourselves up completely and concentrate. But nothing special. I have no tricks. I'm sure you don't need them Mrs Savage. Could we all join hands. And now concentrate on one thing. Empty your minds of everything except the subject. Oh it's tea time. Take my hand precious, it's tea time. We have to go downstairs. Everybody's waiting. Downstairs. You have to be a good girl today. Good girl. No no, no good saying you're tired, it's Sunday. Never tired on Sunday. Mummy, you've got butter on your chin. Look. I'm standing at the top of the stairs. Look at me. Stop that shouting. No I won't, I won't! No don't. Don't make me go downstairs again. Don't make me go today, I want to stay with Arthur. Arthur. He was born dead! You can't see him, you can't see him. They won't let me see him. All that waiting. All that time. Nothing. Nothing to hold. Only Billy. Arthur why are you waiting under the tree alone? In the dark. Why are you waiting there? Mummy why's he waiting under the tree? No. It's all different. I said die. Die! They said dead, he's not. He is not dead, he is not! Arthur why are you waiting there all alone. She should be there. She should've come by now, where is she. Oh she was here, she was here in Arthur's room. Oh she saw him. She saw Billy. She saw him. She saw him. Yes. I'm coming precious, I'm coming, I'm coming. Billy you've taken her. You take her Billy, take her, kill her. Arthur's waiting Billy. Take her Billy. Kill her Billy. Take her. Arthur's waiting, he's waiting Billy. I'm coming. Precious I'm coming, I am coming. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me. Wait for me. It's all right, precious. Where'd you hide the money Mr Savage? In the coal bunker. The garden. She's all right is she. I put her where the scouts would find her. Did I do it right Billy? Yes dear.
