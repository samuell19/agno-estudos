You haven't been forgotten. You still get visitors. Doesn't she have a family? Family... Scum, they abandoned their mother. All they care about is who gets her apartment. Then who is taking care of her affairs? What if something happens to her? She has this nice lawyer, Micha. Micha? Do you know him? Judah. Excuse me, Judah? You can go in now. Hello, Judah. Avner. Avner? Miri said Judah. -She misheard. Come in. How can I help you? Nice office you got here. Old-school. Thank you. It really is. I hear you're a divorce lawyer. Divorce, prenups, wills. Family law. Sounds like a secure profession. I have no complaints. As long as people keep dying. Or divorcing. I'm Ella's husband. Okay. Ella who? Ella Halevi. I'm sorry, I don't think I know her. Never mind. I'm here to write Alright. Any particular reason? My wife just died. I'm sorry to hear that. -Yes. So I was thinking, I want to be prepared. Yes. Listen, I'm really busy, but my partner Dani can help you. No, no. I want you. Okay. Children? A boy and a girl. 9 and 12. How many bank accounts? -One. Did your wife have her own account? -No. We had a joint account. And did you have... excuse me for asking, did you have a prenuptial agreement? -No, why would we? It's something people do. In case of divorce or... e never talked about divorce, ever. It's just important to know, that's all. -Yes. This seems pretty standard to me. I'll need a capital statement... -What about what my wife wanted? What do you mean? We were together for 15 years. What's mine was hers. I have to consider what she would have wanted, right? That's between you and her. -Obviously. Obviously. I just... don't have the experience that you do. Have you made a will? Yes, of course. How did you two divide everything? 'm not married. Divorced? No, I... never got married. How come? I guess I never found the right woman. Doesn't it bother your clients? -Why would it? A single man, no family. You determine visitations, child support. Family law, as you call it. It's odd, isn't it? It's not odd. I know these things. What do you know? Something you read in a book? All you know is how to take it apart. It comes apart by itself. Doesn't it? Zuki... -You asshole. Dry times, Shai? -On the contrary, my friend! You're not getting enough from Tali? -Who? Tali, the hot barmaid. That was a long time ago. There's someone new. A university professor, our age actually. A university professor, our age... I can hear the wedding bells. God forbid. She already has one husband. I'm just a bonus. He's the main course, I'm the tiramisu. -Tiramisu... So you're hitting on married women now? She came on to me. -And you couldn't say no. Why would I say no? Married women are the best. They don't want me to meet the folks, they don't want kids, and most important, they don't sleep over. -You really don't care, huh? About what? -Her life, her family. It's her choice, man, no one is forcing her. You know what I realized, Shai? -What? That you're a coward and a shit. Avner, don't. -What did you say? You heard me. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. Maybe it's time you got laid, Avner. Let off some steam. Widower is a killer status. Women love it. So who is she? -Just a client. Do you take all your clients to "Coral"? Important clients, yes. -And good looking ones. I gather you got a good look. -Are you attracted to her? She's a client, Ella, that's all. So? You're never attracted to your clients? Sometimes I am, so what? So let Dani take her case, and ask her out. I don't do that. -Why not? Because this is work and that's life. You should understand why not. Right. Drop it, Ella. I don't get where this conversation is going. Aren’t you fed up'? 3 hours a week? What kind of life is that? What kind of person are you? -Yes, I'm fed up. Then let me go! Find a young woman with perky tits and leave me alone. I'm sick of being the pathetic excuse for your loneliness. You have to choose if you want to live this lie, or you can come to me and be who you are. I want you. I love you. I love you. Ella... Hey. Did you eat? What's with Daphna? Hurry up, we're late. Duph, what's going on? I'm not going. -What? Daphna. I'm not going! I can't talk to you like this. Open the door. Did you go to Keren last night? What? -Where were you? It's none of your business, Daphna. You think I don't know you're fucking her? Daphna, open the door now! You have no idea what you're talking about. I'm counting to three. One... Two... -Leave me alone! -Three! Daphna! -Go away! Daphna, open the door! Open the door! -Dad... Fine, I'll talk to you later. We're going, Daphna. What's going on, Avner? I did everything right, didn't I? What, the safety report? Whatever. At least we weren't fired. I'm a good father. Sure. I was a good husband. The best. Yes. Where's the car? -That's the car. Mom kept all these? "The teacher called, she found Omer's shoes". That was ages ago. Yes. "I can't go tonight, maybe Keren will go". here's nothing going on between us, Daphna. No? -No. Why would you even think that? Because you don't care that mom died. You never talk about her. And you don't cry. That's because... I was mad at her... I was very mad at her. Why? What did she do? t doesn't matter. Are you still mad? Not anymore. I'm scared. Of what? Of the house being so empty. And quiet. But you like it quiet, don't you? I can't stand it. It's too quiet. Take it. It's so beautiful. Hello. -Hello. Is Avner home? No, do you have his cellphone number? -Yes, I do. Okay. Bye. -Wait... Is this Daphna? Yes. Who is this? An old friend of your mother. You probably don't remember me. What's your name? Micha. Were you at the Shiva? -No, I was abroad, I didn't make it. No school today? -I didn't go. It's that bad? Yes. It's hard for me too, getting back to work. I mean... what for? Yes. At least you have each other. You're a family. Yeah, right... Here it's every man for himself. -Really? So who do you talk to? No one. You miss her. Yes. Me too. It's not fair. -I know... It's not fair. Will you come to the memorial? I don't know. We'll see. Okay. Bye, Micha. Bye. DaPhna' Micha. Avner. What are you doing here? I had a meeting nearby so I left my car here. You going out like that, in the rain? need a cab. A cab? Now? I'll take you. No, no. It's fine. I don't want to put you out. Get in, I'll take you. Where do you need to go? Uptown. -We'll take the tunnels. It's faster. Come on, get in. I thought the tunnels were closed. They're open for us. Buckle up. Micha, can I use your bathroom? I've been holding it in since noon. Yes, of course. Nice view. The bathroom's down the hall. That's enough. Avner. Stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop. Stop. Stop. You knew me from the start? Why didn't you say anything? What could I say? e met 18 months ago, around Passover. A client of mine killed himself. Yochai. -Yes. His siblings claimed the will wasn't valid. I needed a professional opinion. I contacted his therapist. That's how we met. Ella took it very hard. She needed someone to talk to. And you happened to be there. -Yes. I was. Did she tell you about me? -No. How did you find me? Through Marta. So you would meet here? Yes, usually. You saw her the day of the accident. Yes. Did you have sex? Yes. Then what? She said it was over. What was over? She said you knew about us and that's the last time we'd see each other. couldn't let her go. I locked the door, I yelled at her. I told her she was a coward. That she should leave you and move in here with the kids. We had a fight, she... she didn't believe me. She didn't think I meant it. We said things we shouldn't have. Finally I let her go. If she hadn't come here she would still be alive. Yes. But she did come. So... So why did she stay with me? Why didn't she leave? I don't know. Yes? -It's me. I know. Is it urgent? -No. When are you coming home? -Late. Why, are you going out? Avner, we... -Hey! You moron! What are you doing? Shai is acting like an idiot. Maybe he's trying to tell you something. So he should say it like a man. Maybe he's afraid. What's to be afraid of? Of you. Maybe he wants to tell you that he made a mistake. There's no room for mistakes here, Ella. We all make mistakes. Not here. Not with me. Maybe he wants to say he's sorry. How do you know what he wants? So why did you call? To tell you I love you. Okay. See you tonight.
