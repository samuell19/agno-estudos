- The Ayatollah Khomeini, a messenger of the Twelfth Imam of Shiism is here. And so is the law of God. The Shah, his corrupt sinful and westernized ways has hypnotized many of our fellow Persian brothers and sisters. He has bribed them with stolen gold and tempted them with carnal promises. We do not blame those clerics and the citizens who failed to follow the law of the Koran in years past. So long as the Twelfth Imam remains invisible on earth. They were not bound by blood to an honest interpretation of the scripture. But now that the true messenger of the 12th Imam has shown himself, Koranic laws will be enforced to the latter. Stoning of adulterers, amputation for thieves, execution for blasphemy, these can no longer be avoided or purchased the way. Many deny this fact and there are many to be punished all will be dealt with by Islamic law. Even those in the highest positions in the Shah's old government. And today we demonstrate that the Ayatollah Khomeini can touch everyone. This man he denied the obvious. He denied that the Ayatollah Khomeini is the messenger of the Twelfth Imam. For that, Ayad Nabulsi was rightfully sentenced to death. Ayatollah Khomeini is wise and merciful, and he has chosen to spare this man's life. He is simply a thief, by denying that the Ayatollah Khomeini is the true messenger, he has stolen the religious values of the people of Iran. He's just as much a thief as one who steals money from your pocket. His punishment is just and holy and will be executed immediately as the will and judgment of Ayatollah Khomeini. - Mesha, I was told the family friend was coming to see me, I never imagined it would be you. - Your parents sent me. Victor has found out that the Ayatollah has targeted you. - Victor, oh god! He's still trying to Lord over me. - Your parents gave me eleven thousand Toman to help you escape the Mujahideen. - Who says I'm in the Majahideen? - In exchange for finding you and bringing you this money. I want you to take me to them so that I can join. - Excuse me? - I am "The Chadored Killer." What? - His Royal Majesty will see you now. - Majesty. Thank you, Your Majesty. - You may rise. - Well, after reviewing your x-rays in my examination. I believe you are a perfect candidate for an implant. - Huh! You are Iranian? - Yes, Your Majesty. - From where? - Tehran. - Tehran. - Yes. - I suspected that. So how did you come to be a dentist? - Well, I studied mechanical engineering and I have a few small factories in the United States. Several years ago, a group of dentists approached me who invented the implant. The implant wasn't strong enough and it kept breaking. So I showed them how to build a stronger structure for that implant, made me fall in love with dentistry. So I went back to school and I became a prosthodontist Implantologists. - So you invented the implant that you're going to use on me? - I was part of the team, Your Majesty, yes. - Cyrus, why did you not tell me about this man who is head and shoulders above all the others? Dismiss them. It was the wonderful waterfall of fate that brought you to me. - Thank you, Your Majesty. - I trust Cyrus, not only with my life, but something much more important, money. Don't be so casual, it's your money he's in charge of. I can't think of a kinder, more honest, more brilliant man to be Finance Minister of Iran, as well as one of my closest friends and confidants. And Mesha, the only girl sharp enough to talk back to him and win. Your beauty will be remembered as long as you with him. This is a union that God looks down on and wishes for all of his children. I bless this marriage with everything I have in me and from the bottom of my heart because I know you, Cyrus, are a lover of the arts I give to you and Mesha as a wedding present this historical theater. - Your Royal Highness, this is an honor that I cannot describe. - No, the honor is mine Mr. Daniels, your son has become so important to me and so many of my colleagues. When any Royal in the Middle East bites down hard and yells out in pain they call for Victor. And I think it has something to do with you wonderful people. - Thank you. - You flatter us, Your Highness. Victor was smarter than all of us even before entering high school. - Your Majesty, that's my sister, Maheen. - Your Highness. - My brother, Morad. - Your Majesty. - And that's Behrouz, my other brother. Behrouz, please come meet the Royal Highness. - Yes, I must leave, Victor, please forgive me. We will talk tomorrow. You must tell your parents the news or must they read it in the newspapers? - Yes, Your Majesty. - Thank, Your Majesty. - News? - What news? - Tell them. - I will tell you. I will tell you. How can you embarrass me in front of the Shah? - Look at you, your tongue wagging out at him and all of you bowing to him. - Oh stop it. - You did not notice his secret police goons outside? Try asking them how many people they've each made disappear at night. - That's nonsense, it's all rumors. - How the hell would you know? You go from your Manhattan dentist chair to one in a blood-soaked yacht in Oman. All you see are teeth. - What are you talking about Behrouz? You've been in New York for years. - Yeah, and Victor's been paying for it. You should be more appreciative. - Should I? - Yes, yes you should. - Oh, there's something I need to tell you. I'm quitting medical school, moving back to Iran. - Behrouz, what are you talking about? - I just feel like we have to overthrow that tyrant. - You mean the Shah? - Of course, the Shah. - Can you stop talking about the Shah, you don't have correct information. - And you have none. The Shah is no leader, he's puppet capitalist like you- - Shah is none of your concern. Finish your studying so you don't speak so ignorant. - Don't patronize me. Your head is too deep in the sand for me to hear it. And what do you care? As long as you're driving a Mercedes and living in a big, pretentious home, you can pretend everything's fine. - I have been paying 30 grand a year for you to live in that evil America and drive those awful cars. - That's why I'm leaving you. You think your money gives you power. You forgot everything from Mahalleh. - Behrouz. - I- - Victor. - Cyrus. - Thank you, Victor, for bringing your family. - Thank you, Cyrus, congratulations. - Congratulation. - Congratulation. - Congratulation. - Did Victor tell you all the good news? - What good news? - No, what good news? - Shah gave Victor exclusive contract on all car parts in Iran. - Congratulations, Victor. - A monopoly. You are worse than those pigs. - Behrouz! - Because you should know better. - Behrouz! - Did I say something wrong? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Is this the beautiful gold watch your mother was telling me? - Yes. - Yes, yes. - Oh my goodness, it's beautiful. - Cyrus' wedding gift to her. - Wonderful. - It was his grandmother's. - Oh, beautiful. - It's amazing. - And now you better be home on time. You too. - He does not mention that this watch was a wedding gift to himself. - This was grandfather's, but thank you. - Congratulations. - Congratulation. - Congratulation. - What they said about the Ayatollah is true, but he got his whole faction riled up. So they began to protest in the circle all-knowing it is illegal, so the police had to respond. - I do wish they hadn't been so heavy-handed. - I heard they were 30 people were killed. - We should have killed them all. - Oh nonsense. - By the religious laws, they will mourn for 40 days, then they will regroup and protest again. These people are really agitating the police. So more will get killed, and it will grow and grow. - Your Majesty, we need to stop this before it is out of our reach to stop. Killing maybe 5,000 of the protesters will save millions from Khomeini. - I cannot be overthrown, I have the support of 700,000 troops. All of the workers, most of the people even the people who hate me, they're my children. I cannot treat them as enemy invaders. - Cyrus Nahavandi, former Minister of Finance and Economic Policy, will you renounce your allegiance to the Monarchy, in public? - No, I will not. - Cyrus Nahavandi, by the judgment of the Ayatollah Khomeini you are to be executed by firing squad immediately. - I was able to place two implants in the upper jaw and two in the lower jaw. And I gave her a fixed removable denture. - Thank you, Victor. She has a smile worth preserving, does she not? - Yes, Your Majesty. - But that is not why Cyrus and I asked you to come today. 25 years ago, I signed with British Petroleum for drilling and exploration at a rate of 50%, 50%. This was a good deal for them, but not good for us, but I had no choice. We needed the money to modernize it on. We needed the money for hospitals, for universities, for education. In other words, to bring Iran into the 20th century. - In 1964, I left an underdeveloped Iran and I came back to a modern thriving country. - Yes you did. Now, British Petroleum contacted me last week and demanded that I renew the contract under the same terms. Now this is where you come in Victor, with your world-class dentistry, your factories, your prominence. You know a number of people who can be extremely helpful to us. - You're exaggerating, Your Majesty. - Victor, you are one of the few people who's on a first name basis with that volume of Royals and oil barons. - I can't do it myself, it would cause too much attention and cause British Petroleum to give us trouble. But what I would like you to do is ask around, try to form a consortium at a rate of 25%. But remember it has to be outside of OPEC. - But that almost all the major oil companies. - Yes, this is true. But they did not have a monopoly on all the oil. There are on others. We will no longer accept this 50/50 agreement. His Royal Majesty has agreed to 25% and 75% for the people of Iran. - Seventy-three percent. - Your Majesty, what happens to the other 2%? - Victor by Allah, you are going to be as rich as those Sheiks - This is not why I'm doing this, Mesha. - He's already a rich man. - Oh, this is about more than money, Victor. I mean oil? That is more precious than water. The whole world will be bowing to you. - Yes, with a fake smile and a knife in their pocket. - I bet your wife probably has that knife in her pocket with you traveling around the world half the time. Miriam probably thinks we're assembling a heir. Nothing's worse than a woman scorned. - Very funny, Mesha. - Victor, I was thinking, when you're off traveling the world and working on royals teeth, selling carburetors and radiators, keep your ears open. Maybe something pops up, just don't make it a big deal. - When the Shah asks you for something, it is a big deal. - How is your brother? - Morad is doing well, he is running three of my companies. - I mean Behrouz. - We haven't talked to him for over a year. - Victor, we know he's in the Mujahideen. - We just mean that they are worried for you. And don't worry, we're not gonna tell the Shah. - I don't know what to do. I mean, he was going to medical school in New York, he had nothing to do with politics and all of a sudden he started talking about the SAVAK and the people who they have killed and tortured. I am, I don't know. I don't know what to do. - How does someone like Behrouz even approach Mujahideen? I mean, how do you go from working in an office and watching TV to meeting with a terrorist leader and explaining that you want to blow up movie theaters? And he's Jewish. Wouldn't they assume he's a spy and kill him site? - Well, for all I know that's exactly what happened. - How did you find me, rich boy? - I paid the cleric, my last 10,000 Toman. I don't talk with my westernized family anymore, I have nothing now, but myself to offer you. - Why are you here? - To overthrow the Shah. I met him once at a wedding. I wish I leaped on him with a knife and plunged it deep into his neck. But I looked away. That day echoes in my head so loudly, that's why I ended up here. - Why should I trust a Jew from New York? - I am from Iran. Jews and Christians have bled the Persians to feed their endless greed for centuries. Starting today, I am with you. - Well then pray to Allah while I think of a way for you to prove your conviction. - Allah auakbar. - Victor Daniels online. - Victor, give me some good news. - Your Majesty, the meeting never happened. The Italian Petroleum guys and their plane blew up in the sky. They said it was a mechanical faliure. - This is a message from OPEC and British Petroleum. - You think? - This really complicates matters. - Your Majesty, what- Hello? Hello? - Hello, Victor it's me. Victor, Victor! Hello, it's me. - Your Highness, thank you so much for taking my call. - Oh, Victor, please. You know that you and your family are always welcome in my home. Victor, remember I was telling you that I can get you a wonderful second wife. I have three of them with me now. - Thank you, Your Majesty. Your Highness, I can not get in touch with the Shah. - Oh, well, there is a good reason why you can't get in touch with the Shah. He has left Iran. - What? - He took with him a single handful of soil. - How could he leave? He is our king. - Well, it seems that he felt it was the only way to stop the rebellion other than a full civil war. He said he would respect the wishes of thee Iranian people. - Your Majesty, my father has been arrested by the Ayatollah. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - He's in Evin prison, can you help me? - Well, I have some money in a bank in Iran. I can give it to some low-level workers that can sneak him out. Yeah, and you can pay me in my American account. - How much are we talking about? - Whoa for the ponds like this two million Tamon should get them to forget about the Ayatollah. - I can do that. How soon can we do this? - Oh, well not so fast these days, your country is in a, how do you say, a transition. - Oh God! Oh poor child! Victor - Serah, must you leave. Have you seen my? Mesha! Mesha! Mesha! It's not Cyrus, calm down. It's not Cyrus. Mesha! - In the streets of Tehran, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators celebrate the ousting of the Shah and the return from exile of Ayatollah Khomeini, leader of Iran's Muslim fundamentalists. The Ayatollah proclaims his own Islamic revolution. Many foreign owned businesses and industries are nationalized and their assets confiscated without payments. - As much as I hate Khomeini, I hate the Shah too. - It's Cyrus, Mesha. Oh Mesha, come home. I am done Mesha, we have to call an ambulance. - They will not come, mother. Help me drag him away. - The anti-Khomeini have one thing in common, hatred of the Shah and his secret police, SAVAK. The fearsome ways of change forced by the Shah in the name of progress made more appealing the certainty of the old life under Allah and his Ayatollahs. The young people of Iran are among the fiercest new advocates of the old ways. The women parted into the future by the Shah dawn the traditional Muslim chador and march in frenzied support of the Ayatollah. - Do you love the revolution? - I do. - Do you love the Ayatollah Khomeini? Do you offer yourself up entirely to his will? Yoke yourself from the invariable, unchanging, invisible law of Islam? - Yes, of course. - It's sad, you are so naive. It's hardly even your fault. - What? - Were you at Jashed? - Who are you? - What have you done? - They make us wear chador again, I will use it against them. - But Mesha, how can you do it? - I shouldn't tell you more mother, for your own safety but I can tell you this. It was easy. - Love you. Okay, go, go, go. It will be okay sweetheart. - Let's just get in the car and go with- - Be strong, Maheen, please. - Okay, you will stay completely away from Tehran, right? - Swear to God we'll take the very scenic route. - Okay, good. Thank you, Morad. - I love you. - I love you. - So why can't we go to Tehran? - Somebody's been killing Ayatollah's men leaving a note saying that, "It's because of Jashed." Military is on a max alert so we go through the countryside. - Cool. - We can go, it's not too late. We can leave today right now. - What, and leave everything that we have behind? - I don't want anything. - Maheen, I've worked my entire life for the kind of success that we have with that company. I'm not going to give it away to any man or to any court, at least not without the fight. - Mr. Kashani, you will pay the full due to the Islamic Republic even if you must pay with your life. Go home, look around at the sinful decadence and feel your delicate flesh the horror it has brought to the Persian people. This is the price you pay for being a slave to greed. - If it is all so awful, then why are you stealing it from me? Isaac! Isaac! - Hello? - Uncle, it's Bijou, I'm at the dock. - Bijou, are you okay? - Yes Uncle Morad just left. I wanted to call you so you can tell me parents everything's fine. Do you know if my father has gone to the court hearing yet? Yes, yes, yes. It was nothing. It was just, it was nothing, just a fine. - Okay, because I'm not smuggled yet, I can still come back. - No, no, get on the boat. Your parents will meet you here in New York. - Fantastic. You're the best uncle, thank you. - See you in New York. Hello? - Victor. Victor, is that you? It's Captain Sabeti. - Captain, Isaac is dead. - No, I thought he had been released. - No, it was too late. - Well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this but it's about your brother, Behrouz. - Fuck, Behrouz! Him and his Mujahideen buddies caused all this. If he was I would have strangled in myself. - Well, this week the Ayatollah has turned against the Mujahideen and now Behrouz is on a kill list. - I thought they were all Muslim fanatics? I mean, how can he turn on them? - The Mujahideen are Marxist Muslim fanatics, so Ayatollah Khomeini had ordered all of them to be put in front of a firing squad. He already has a large part of that list lined up and shot, but not your brother yet. I tried telling your parents, but I cannot find them. Do you know where they're hiding? Victor, if you want to help Behrouz tell me where they are. - Excuse me, sir, I am lost. Do you know how to get to Karaj? - Ma'am, you're far off. - Victor told us that Behrouz has been targeted by Ayatollah Khomeini. He's on some kill list that is getting shorter by the day. - I'm sorry, Sarah. Do you know how to get in contact with him? - We haven't spoken in sometime. It's humiliating to see a child go so far out of reach. So out of everything you taught him. I try to think what I did wrong, that he ended up so full of anger, so different from me. - I've come to realize, Sarah, that after we mothers give our children life we lose little bit of power over them every day from then on. - But we never stop trying, do we? It just makes our hair gray when they don't listen. Some tea. - Well, Sabeti gave us a good idea about where we may be able to find him. Not that Mujahideen have listed phone numbers. Samuel and I we have to go in person and try to look for him. - Mother, they saw me. Two mullahs, one I killed, the other one got away. I have to get out of here tonight. - Hello, Mesha. - Hello, Sarah. I'm sorry to hear about Isaac. - Thank you. Why do you have a gun Mesha? - Because I killed another one of those bastards. - You're the Chadored Killer? - What do you expect me to do? - Clean house all day until I drop dead, a bag of bones? Weep myself to sleep? That is what they expect me to do, but that is not my way. Allah protects the innocent with this. - Mesha, if you live by their rules, you become like them. - I live by my own rules, Sarah. That is the only way out of this madness. I was done the day I looked upon those faces at Jashed. - Stop, I have to tell you, Cyrus wouldn't want this for you. - Cyrus wouldn't have wanted this for any of Iran, but it has been forced on us. You and Sarah, can you sit by and deny what is happening but I cannot. This is no longer a country for decent human beings, but for killers and fanatics. - What can I do? My daughter is a murderer. - He was hilarious, those pirates made me laugh so hard, uncle. - I'm so happy that it already worked out. - My dad is absolutely gonna love it here. Do you know when my parents are getting here? - Bijou, your father's not going to make it. - What do you mean? - When they took him for questioning, they tortured him, he made it home back then but he died from internal bleeding, I'm sorry. - No, you told me he was fine. - I promised your mother. - I talked to you that day- - I didn't want you to go back. - You told me he was fine. - I'm really sorry about that. - You lied to me. - I promised your mother. - You fucking liar, get off. - Please. Let me take you home. - No - Let me take you home. - I don't have a fucking home. - Mesha, I was told the family friend was coming to see me. I never imagined it would be you. - Your parents sent me. Victor has found out the Ayatollah has targeted you. - Victor, Oh god, he's still trying to lord over me. - Your parents gave me eleven thousand Toman to help you escape the Mujahideen. - Who said I'm in the Mujahideen? - In exchange for finding you and bringing you this money, I want you to take me to them, so that I can join. - Excuse me? - I am the Chadored Killer. - What? Don't join them, they're as crazy as the Ayatollah. I just didn't know how to leave them before. - They are the only ones left fighting the regime. I will teach our women to kill, as I have killed. I will teach them to be victors, not victims. Let them make us wear the Chador. We will strike those hypocrites where they pray, every ruler and cleric will pay the price for this atrocity. - Excuse me, Your Holiness. - Yes, my dear. - Wait. You. Well done my sisters, tonight we were split into three groups. Always leave the note. Let's go. - Got everything? - Yeah, I have everything. Hello? - Victor, I'm glad I got you. It's captain Sabeti. - Captain, I'm on my way to the airport to meet up with Maheen, is everything okay? - Don't go. Maheen has been arrested and so has your father. - Oh no, God damn it. My mother? - She's with me. She'll be safe for now. - Thank you, Captain. Captain, my father's heart condition is serious. He cannot survive long in prison. Can we pay the guards one more time? - It has passed the point of greasing a few hands, we're going to have to buy off one of the top 10 Ayatollahs, maybe even Khalikhali. - Will that work? - I don't know, but if it does they're going to want everything. - I'm worth 350 million. - Including properties, factories, and debts owed to you. More if you count all the things the Ayatollah has already seized and assets like your parents' house you still legally own it even though your parents have been kicked out. The deed is right here in New York it's in your name and it still has value. - I don't think this piece of paper here Manhattan means anything to Khomeini in Iran. - I think you have more than enough assets in cash to work with. Politically, it looks good if they obtained property through legal transfers even the Ayatollah will place value on that. - He thinks he's doing the God's bidding and therefore beyond reach here on earth. - But if they remain in jail, can any of our money go to getting them better healthcare? - I think getting out of Evin prison safely and organizing another escape is the most anyone can hope for. - What will be left after everything on that chart's gone? - We won't be destitute, Victor still has his dental practice. In regards to the automotive businesses, if creditors outside of Iran come after you personally, you can declare bankruptcy. - Bankruptcy? Never. - It's not about word, Victor. You'd be shocked if you saw the long roster of industrial leaders who've declared bankruptcy. Henry Ford, P.T. Barnum, Walt Disney... - Victor will be fine, we have other obstacles- - Oh please. Why the fuck did I go back to Iran? Why did I take my fucking hard-earned money and invest it in that doomed idea? Iran never did anything for me, never gave me anything. I left hell hole because I wanted to be a better person. I kept running back with my tongue hanging out, "Oh, look at me. Look at me." A poor old-boy-made-good. Flattered by all the glitter and the Shah's attention, and Royal favors and... Fuck! Liquidate everything I have. Prepare real estate transfer, and find a fucker who's dazzled by it next. - My son worked in America and made lots of money and brought it here. He never took any of that money out of Iran, you can check the numbers. - You are still charged with usury and we have a witness. - I never asked that man to pay me interest. I simply requested for him to return his loan in parts, and of course, interest free. - Did this man ask you for an interest or adjust what you owed him? - I have no money to pay him. All I have is my home and he wants to take that away from me. If I had the money I wouldn't have had to borrow it from him, he knows that. Why does he come to me demanding what he knows I don't have to give. - Look into my eyes my child and speak only the truth. Did this man ask you for interest? - I have no money to pay him, he was going to sell my house. I have a family. We cannot be out on the streets again. Will you forgive me? - Thank you, you may go. You may leave Mr. Daniels. - Thank you, Your Holiness. - But do not try flee Tehran again, because if you do there will be a trial. - Hello? Oh, hold on a minute. Victor, it's your brother. - Brother. - It's Behrouz, Victor. - What do you want? - I wanted to thank you for warning me about the kill list, I got out of there as soon as I could. - Where are you? - Pakistan. I got a ride inside a cargo train. I was able to bribe some people got here in one piece. - Congratulations. Once again, you got away. Thanks to someone else's money. - I don't really know anyone in Pakistan, was thinking of maybe coming back to New York and going back to medical school. - I remember you ripping up your green card and calling me and the whole country bloodsucking imperialists. Now you want me to pay for you to come back here. You think you can pick up for where you dropped off? - I know we've had our differences, Victor, I'm sorry. - Sorry? You're sorry. You're sorry for getting your wish? For the Shah to be gone and your lunatic friend to take over? This is not a fucking game, Behrouz. Isaac is dead, did you know? Maheen had a nervous break down and the father is barely alive. And it's just all because you and your lunatic friends... Behrouz! Behrouz! Fucking asshole. - This is 1929 fuck side- - Your Highness, I understand but you were saying that you're going to put my parents in an ambulance. - Yes, we're going to put them in an ambulance, someone on the plane will pretend to be sick, therefore the ambulance will be going to the plane. Your parents would get off and get on the plane. It's all been worked out. All you have to do is tell me when you want this to start. - As soon as possible. - Fuel the jet and to make sure that you get my crew, my crew, go. - Thank you, Your Highness. - Ah, what good is all this money if you can't help a friend in need. Victor, I do have one condition. You must go personally to make sure this happens correctly. - I can't go to Iran, Your Highness. - You must see this through you. You don't understand that it could be catastrophic to my family if you were to be caught. - I understand but they will shoot me on sight if they see me, Your Honor. - We're giving you a fake passport, you're going to be fully quainted, and make you a member of my family. We'll call you Sheik Mustafa Abdullah, huh? No one will bother Sheik Mustafa Abdullah. You must have faith my friend, you must have faith. - Go, go, I just reported it. We should have six minutes before they even leave the medics, go. - Victor! - Shit! - What is this ambulance doing here? - Hello? - We have a sick crew member. - Why was our medic team not called? - It was, but I have a history with the hospital and had them contacted before we even landed here. Is there a problem? - It's against protocol. We have our own medical facility and safety procedures. - No, no. - Excuse me, if you don't need me I have other emergency calls I should go to. - Rambod, I have bad news. Hahmed's dead, Behrouz is missing and Sepehr has been taken by the Hezbolah. - What? Oh, this is a disaster. We're going to be totally compromised. We have to pull out of here. - Sepehr's all right, everything's safe. They've agreed to release him. - Impossible. They'd rip his eyes out before they let him go. - He had told them about Mesha. - Of course he did. - So I talked to the girls and tomorrow they bring her downtown where Hezbolah will be waiting for her. - Sepehr cuts a deal with the Hezbolah to save his own ass. And he expects all of us to betray Mesha for those rats? - It's not to save him, it's to save everything we've been working for. - Rambod, open your eyes that woman's mad. Killing mullahs and Ayatollahs, blowing up mosques. She's doing more damage than good. Even anti-Khomeini are turning against us. If she has to be sacrificed. - Sacrificed? You call her mad? And do you honestly believe that once the Hezbolah catches Mesha, they'll be satisfied? - Don't be so naive. - Look at yourself. You're so infatuated that you can see straight. - We know you'd betray us in an instant for your precious pretty killer. - Are you questioning my loyalty? When you talk to me, of your own justified betrayal. - It's for the greater good of bringing down the Ayatollah Khomeini and it doesn't matter, we've been ordered to do it. - Yeah, that's always been good enough for a little mind like yours. - Danush, Rajavi, stop! Trading insults like won't do our course any good. Let's discuss all these problems in the morning after we've all had some rest. - Mesha! Darling, are you okay? - Yes, but I have to be quick. Do you know how I can get in contact with Victor? - It's for you Victor. - Mesha? - Victor? You're in Iran? - That's a long story, where are you, honey? - I am desperate, I am in Ahvez, but I need to get out of Iran. - Can you get to Iraq. - I do not know, the roads are all monitored. - Okay, use the Gulf, and try to get to Basra, and then call my office, I will try to connect you with someone. - Okay, I understand. - What happened. - She wants me to get her out of Iran. - Oh my God! - What's going on? - Victor, there's something you should know about Mesha. - Mesha, it's me! - Have you been following me? - Yes, Mesha. - Did the Mujahideen send you to kill me? - No, Mesha- - Why are you here? Tell me now! - Is that it? Is this what you want? Is this all you want anymore? Huh? Do it! Well, go on! - If she's a known terrorist, there will be a huge consequence for all of us if they find out you're sneaking her in to America. - She's not a terrorist. - Killing clerics? Blowing up Mosques? - She loved Cyrus very much, it's just isn't her. You must understand, Cyrus was your best friend. - I'm sorry Haleh, but how can I help someone like that? - The rules have changed my son, this is a war. Imagine if they took Miriam and tortured her for fun, what would you do? Imagine if you find us in pile of dead bodies, and you're isolated, all by yourself, what would you do? You can't understand her hate? - Please Victor. - They will throw all of us in jail if we get caught. - You know her better than I do, but even I know that killer isn't her, it's just what she had to become. - I don't need you anymore. - Rajavi, why did you join the Mujahideen? - My sister, Shirin was her name. She... - What? - She marched in a student demonstration for women's rights. She was a freshman in college, so beautiful, so full of pure ideas. Then Khomeini's men dragged her in for questioning, and they couldn't find her guilty of anything, they raped her repeatedly, and then killed her. But it wasn't just her, it was scores of women they caught over there, and they bragged that they did it because when they killed them, she'd be unmarried non-virgin who'd go straight to hell, and their punishment would be eternal. Word got out and the demonstrations stopped. - So you joined the Mujahideen? - There was no one else to help me kill them. - We need to get out of here, we need to escape this place, we need to leave this life and never look back. - How? - We can take a boat to Iraq, I have a connection to get out from there. - Mesha, I mean, how do we forget? - By falling in love. - He's not coming, maybe the Komiteh got him. It's too late, we should stop waiting. Oh my God, what should we do? We should run! What should we do? - Victor? - Relax, I think it's them. - How can you tell? Victor, you should hide. - I thought you said it was gonna be an ambulance. - Victor. - Mandis. - Okay, perfect, you're all here. I've got enough coffins for everyone. - What if they open the casket and look? - They may not look into the coffin at all, but then again, they might. - So you need to breathe really very light, but don't hold your breath. - That's it? That's the plan. - No, we do more, but I am going to apply fake blood and makeup. - We can take sleeping pills. - Dad, we don't have the sleeping pills. - Is this gonna work? - It can work, but you need to act dead, not be asleep. And I won't lie to you, pretending to be dead is very hard, just when you don't want to move is when every inch of your skin seems to itch. - Are you experienced in this? Serving as Sheik Omar's pilot isn't my primary job. - Mother, Mandis is Kuwaiti intelligence. - Guys, I know this is dangerous, was more dangerous for us to stay here in Iran, especially for me. Our only other option is to run over those mountains and fight the wolves. - I'd rather face the wolves than Khalkhali; they're more reasonable. - But Mary, your condition, I don't think you can. - I can't do this, I can't go with you. Please understand, I can't lay down in my own casket, every moment getting closer to being buried alive, I'll scream, I'll sweat, I'll ruin it for all of you. - Haleh, you can do it, we are gonna be with you. - No, Sarah, I just can't imagine living in America, Iran is my home. - But don't you wanna join Mesha? - I do, I do. - But? - Mesha has gone her own way, and I must accept that. Allah will protect her now, she has fought for him, she has killed for him, now, she belongs to him, not to me. I have family in Tabiz, I can drive there, it will be harder for them to find you if you don't abandon the car. I will visit family for a week or two, then go home. Oh, Haleh. - Victor, if you ever see my daughter again, please give this to her, it was Cyrus's wedding gift to her, perhaps it will remind her of who she used to be. - I will do that. - Thank you victor. You said you can fake Khalkhali's signature? - And how I'm I gonna breathe in this thing, how is this gonna work? - Mum. - Victor. - Mum, trust me. It's gonna be okay, it's going to work. - Do you think you could be pregnant? - Yes, I cannot be sure till I see a doctor, but- - Then we need to find a doctor for you right away. - I am fine. It must be from that first night. - Yeah. - I cannot live remembering it, it was almost like a dream. - That's why you need to get an abortion. What? - It's Okay, I have enough money left, we'll find someone good, you won't feel sick anymore. - You told me you loved me, you only wanted to fuck me. - I do love you Mesha, but I'm not ready to become a father, I cannot allow you to have the baby. - I do not need your permission! - Listen to me, I know what's best here, I cannot be a father now Mesha, and you cannot be a mother, you know that. - You have no power over me! - It's this simple, you give up this child, or I will leave you on your own, and this baby will be a bastard. - You are the only bastard I see! - Mesha! Oh fuck! - Allah, can I ever be worthy of this child inside of me? Guide me. I am yours. - Mesha, Mesha I am sorry. - Go, don't speak. - Mesha, don't ever tell this child about us, don't let him suffer for our sins. - Our child will not suffer, I will teach our child to love. - You have reached the offices of Dr. Victor Daniels, Please leave a message. - Victor, it's Mesha, are you there? Please pick up the phone, I am in Iraq, but I am desperate, I need help. Please, please help me, Victor. - Easy. - Hello, my friends. - What is this? - Deceased relatives of a very important man. - Rebels? - No, friends of the Ayatollah Khalkhali, the family of Sheik Omar from Kuwait, you know the plane outside, it's one of his fleet, you didn't get the paperwork? - No, and nothing leaves without paperwork. - Of course. - Let me see these so-called dead bodies. - You want to offend the Sheik by opening the caskets of his deceased relatives? - Who are they to the Sheik? - A cousin, and an aunt and uncle. - Okay, put them on the plane. Stop, I have to look, my apologies to the Sheik, but I have to look, open that one. - You can't do that. - Oh, you must open that one. - Okay, okay, I will, get me the crowbar. - What happened to them? - Killed by the Mujahideen. - Why wasn't the Komiteh told? - You know, Sheiks and Ayatollahs, they operate above us in a way, Allah provides for them differently. - Open up the other coffins, who's in this coffin? - The Sheik's aunt. - Don't you dare touch her! - Ah, stay back, Woman! - Have you no respect! Have you no religion! - It is my duty to- - You lay a hand on that woman, and Allah will never forgive you! Neither will the Ayatollah Khalkhali, he is a great and just man, and his love and respect for Sheik Omar is strong, and his love is strong for me too, because I am the Sheik's daughter, and this is my family. - Even the death of the Shah in Egypt has no effect on the Iranian crisis. The man who ruled Iran for 38 years is in the end a man without a country. - Isaac Kashani cannot be replaced. He wasn't just a family member to most of us and me, he was a friend, a mensch, as we say in Yiddish, we can never replace that blood. We all lost loved ones, and I cannot explain why those lives were taken. I will not stand here to say that those deaths were God's will, because God gave them their lives, and someone else's will took that life. What's happening in our homeland? What's going on in Iran? Why do we allow them to shoot us down and make us run and hide from fear? I don't believe, I don't believe that they ever truly understood evil until I experienced these atrocities happening in Iran. Are we really that blind that we couldn't see it coming? Are we so ignorant that we gave it fuel to grow? How? How can we fight this evil without becoming the evil that we hate so much? Could we have banded together and put a stop to it? Or are we only united when we are on the run and forced to search for a new promised land?
