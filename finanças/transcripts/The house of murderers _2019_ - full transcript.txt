Let's start from the beginning, will you? Oh, well... I didn't ask, do you want something to drink? You are very kind but don't worry. Can you look at me? Yes of course Erika told me about her arrival, that night... Turn right and then turn on the left Fuck you! Go on for three kilometers Take the second exit at the roundabout Why?! He was a cheat and he used to beat me don’t you think that was enough? And so you just left... so typical of you! Yeah, and as a punishment I have ended up in Dracula’s mansion fighting against rats! To tell you the truth, that house has always made me anxious that’s why I’ve always kept away from there It's been virtually uninhabited since my parents died. Great! Come on, in a couple of days it’s gonna be like new again Until a few years ago, my aunt still used to pay the electricity bill I never figured out why. But she was like 80... Okay. I gotta get to work now... And, joking aside, thanks you saved my life For such a small thing? Wait! Look at this, what do you think about it? It’s for the new shooting. Same old Jenny! Anyway, it’s very sexy. Say hi to your gorgeous husband if he wants me back to Chicago for a fashion show... I’m here! I really need a change in my life. Lol! Kisses bad chick! come on, get out... show yourself Come on, this way, you're the best Yeah, come on ... take off everything... So you're telling me that Erika was a prostitute? This was not in the police reports Well, I wouldn't say that She was a model and an actress. But sometimes she also used that method to raise some money. Ok, ok. Let's go on, will you? Hello? Hello... who is it...? So at first she had no problems. No. She was settling down. She was a strong person, who reacted well in every situation. She desperately tried to get rid of her old life. She told me she had also met someone in the village. They were not very hospitable people, you know, anyway better than nothing... May help you, miss? Thank you I don't know how to thank you. You are very kind. I could be even more advanced now. Who is it?! Hey! Are you still here? What did you forget? Who the hell is it?! What happened?! Why are you still here? I forgot my cigarettes... And I also wanted to say goodbye... Don’t you ever just get tired? Go get your cigarettes. Allright Good night. Wake up, bitch You know, you'll burn in Hell for this You gave me so much pleasure Now die You've finally arrived We all was waiting for you I'm gonna call the police! I don’t know what to say, sweetheart. Really. So, you’ve never heard any weird story about this house? What do you mean by weird?! You know, voices, visions... You said it scared you. Oh, come on! I was scared as a little girl just because it was isolated. No weird story. You’re just being influenced by loneliness and silence But I receive phone calls from unknown numbers. I see ghostly shadows and I keep having nightmares Are you sure it’s not your ex boyfriend? Often men that are violent are also vengeful, you know? Perhaps Listen, how come it’s so difficult for you to find someone to spend the night with you? That way, you would at least deal with the nightmares’ problem! Oh... that’s not really an issue. One thing I liked as a kid was swinging in the patio. Is the swing still there? Patio? It was many years ago. Then they did some renovation work but I had already stopped going by that time Do you actually get better instead of aging? Do you prefer more slender types? More slender? Everything’s perfect there it almost stimulates my male part! We’re ready here. Bye, oldie! So you ended up in this shithole because of a man, right? Yes, but let's not talk about it... I’d rather live the present. The old women in town say this house is evil. Evil? How can a house be evil? You’re right. You know what small towns are like There are old stories, rumors dating back to when I was a child. Then rumors kind of escalate and... What kind of stories? I do not know, I can't remember. Some fool had died in here or Some fool had died in here or had killed someone, maybe had killed someone, maybe They called it “the house of murderers” or something like that Seems like a lot of murderers Seems the house draws them Impressive, isn’t it? You didn’t know anything about it? Look, this is the house of a friend of mine she may be crazy, but she’s not a murderer Besides, she lives in Chicago and when you were a child she had not even been born! I had always wondered what it felt like with someone like you but here, in town we don’t even have whores can you imagine? If you only knew what those boors down there say behind your back And yet I know most of them would be happy to fuck you You’re better than any woman in town! I see that wine makes you garrulous Why don't you stay here for the night? Are you married? No, no family. No, nothing So, what? Are you afraid of the old people in town? You are a bitch, you shuold do it professionally You could live like a queen here! What the hell...! It doesn't end here Fuck! Amy listen, you have to come here right now There's something wrong Just a moment Before moving on to Amy, I would like to know something more about this man He suddenly falls into Erika's life and then seems to disappear into nothingness Indeed. But I've never seen him. The cops asked me too I think they found traces Yes, we'll get there later. Well, let's go back to Amy? It’s weird that you’ve seen strange things here after three days I would have run away the very first day, even without seeing anything! Good morning to you! Looking at your face, I would say you’ve had yet another terrible night You can say that again In a way, this place does have its own charm! It’s a shame that I had no chance to really enjoy it But I'm lucky to have so many good friends one gave me this house and the other one has come to save me from the house! So, won't you tell me what happened? By the way, you offended me: why didn’t you tell me anything. I should never forgive you for that, you know? You’re right... It’s only that sometimes things happen so suddenly. All right, I'll forgive. Now, tell me, then maybe the ghosts will disappear As long as everything was fine, he was able to restrain himself Then... he started beating me regularly. I have always told you that he was raving mad! Besides, he was a security guard... He started having drinking problems after his father’s death The more weapons they carry, the weaker they are! They need a big phallic symbol to compensate! What happened the night you left him? Would you believe me if I told you I do not remember anything? Of course, I understand you prefer to forget about it No, it’s not that. It’s strange I have been thinking about it he was raising his hands once again I remember the stench of alcohol coming from his mouth a moment later I was outside, getting into my car And then I got here. It was I felt like I was trapped I accumulated so many dreams, too many and now I want to start modelling again Look at this Do you think it looks like that because of the dust? And who the fuck is that it was just you and me Jesus...! I didn’t notice that on the camera screen Are you sure you haven't edited them just to scare me? I swear I haven't! Okay, enough with that. I want to get to the bottom of this! That’s my girl! Right, but where do we start? I know what to do. A friend of mine, who is a real geek can't wait to do some shooting of paranormal activities instead of wedding ceremonies ust let me make a couple of phone calls. Don’t worry, he’s raving mad, but he’s not dangerous! come in, dear Is this the first time you’ve been asked to record ghosts? I’d say so, unless you want me to consider certain guests at wedding ceremonies! I have watched all the scary movies though and I know what real ghostbusters do in these cases, you know? Come here, girls Have a look at this and tell me what you think about it Shit! That’s scary Is this some kind of technical problem? If a videocamera did that teach me how to do recreate that effect Should I take it as a no? How can you still stay in the house after that? Come on, dude, shouldn’t you be reassuring us? You’re right. It’s just that I'm a hungry, and when I'm hungry... All right, I got it. Camera "a" And what would that be? A k2 a detector for magnetic fields specifically made for paranormal investigations All tv series have it Do I need to teach you everything?! When do you enter the story? Well, just after... Are you ok? Do you want us to interrupt? Yes ... I've a bad headache. Ok. We resume later. Stop. So, you are a more comfortable here, isn't it? Tell me, what happened before? Nothing ... a headache, I told you. I suffer from it. Well. So we arrived at your entry into story Yes. Amy called me because of what happened the night before I don’t know what that is exactly, but I swear it’s all edible So, what about the outcome of your investigations? I still have to watch the shootings carefully The instruments recorded some peaks, especially in your bedroom but what impressed me most was the tour of the place that was really some crazy shit “the house of the devil” What kind of a place is this one? Well, there are a variety of opinions What the fuck Can you understand what it says? Wait, maybe if I... “Basterd” Therese... This place is not peaceful. There’s... hate... and pain which have accumulated for a long, long time. And... which have accumulated for a long, long time. And... What? What? I don’t know. I need more time to understand these feelings I have There are some ancient ruins nearby, aren’t there? How do you know that? Have you ever been here? The ancient places are one of the things I perceive more distinctly. This place reminds me of my village in the South. Do you still have all your family there? And why did you decide to move to “the city”? I left Sicily because of my gift... The people of my village treated me like some kind of witch. The daughter of a witch, and the granddaughter of a witch And what your “gift” be exactly? You can imagine I feel the presence of those who are no longer among us And... well, sometimes they talk through me I know it’s hard to believe I don’t know what to believe since I came into this house! So, what have you felt inside? A lot of cruelty, sorrow and suffering. Also of children I can still feel their frightened voices It must be terrible your gift I mean Can I ask you how you ended up here? Love affair with a bad ending And where is he now? I really don’t know. I have erased him for good Over the years, I have learned to do so in order not to carry the burden over my shoulders, you know We all wear a mask to survive, don’t we? And how do you find it here? I share a room with a female student and I work in a call center It feels great, like being born again! What’s up? Let's get back inside I feel a little bit dizzy Therese! What's going on? Help! Help me, please! Therese! What are you doing? What happens? What happened? Another headache? No. I just said it. These things happen to me, they happened to my mother and my grandmother I can't help it. Are you a seer? A medium, I would say That is, I don't foresee the future or similar things simply I feel the presences that are always around us It's like an instinct, that's it But in that case you didn't just "hear", I think As you say, you were about to act you threatened physically, then you had a failure you threatened physically, then you had a failure It would be useless It would be useless What is it? A kind of possession? It would be useless It would be useless I believe so It would be useless It would be useless A temporary possession by a spirit, not demonic possession It would be useless It would be useless I become a ... sort of channel It would be useless It would be useless And I think it's because of the ancient ruins too It would be useless It would be useless There was something wrong in there. It would be useless It would be useless I see It would be useless It would be useless So if you have been threatening with Erika it means that the spirit that was stalking her had bad intentions? It would be useless It would be useless That voice...it was frightening It would be useless It would be useless I can't believe someone could deliberately change her voice so much It would be useless It would be useless Did it remind you of someone? It would be useless It would be useless Maybe... but I couldn’t really say It would be useless It would be useless Why are you asking me? It would be useless It would be useless I was possessed for a few minutes It would be useless It would be useless Is that the same figure of the picture? It would be useless It would be useless I think so It would be useless It would be useless The same of the room that becomes cold? It would be useless It would be useless I don’t think so It would be useless It would be useless This house is full of entities It would be useless It would be useless And I’ve had different feelings It would be useless It would be useless And who would be this... person or whatever it is? It would be useless It would be useless I don’t think it’s a spirit which is close to you It would be useless It would be useless I believe it’s a parasite It would be useless I believe it’s a parasite an evil spirit It would be useless an evil spirit It would be useless You mean, dangerous? It would be useless It would be useless Okay. We’ve seen and heard a lot these days It would be useless It would be useless What do we do now? It would be useless It would be useless We have to go back to the origins It would be useless It would be useless we need to understand what these entities are, in order to decide what to do It would be useless It would be useless Tomorrow I'll do some research, on the Internet and at the town hall It would be useless It would be useless ven if you knew every single minute of their lives now they are different they are something else Then you tell us what to do! A séance It’s the only way to communicate with the entities without any veil You mean a... séance? One of those séances? Therese, are you sure? I am no expert, but isn’t it dangerous? Could the spirits completely possess the house and maybe us, once and for all? I’ve already dealt with this kind of entities If I can communicate with them without being overwhelmed I will make them go away. But listen, I'm not sure I want to do this anymore I mean, this is not even my place wouldn’t it be enough to just go aware... If a parasite nurses a grievance against you you will take it along with you, wherever you go They’re not bound to the place, but to the person If the spirit haunted the person and not the house it means that Erika was lost, right? Is that what you meant? No, I didn't say this One also defends oneself from the spirits, the solution is not always to succumb But that way ... sorry, but I think that Erika was very influenced by what you were saying What do you mean? What I said. Was Erika scared...? She had several things to frighten over what I told you ”Apparently the house has collected a series of uninvited guests over the years people who arrived here accidentally and who then committed violent crimes or murderers who took shelter here after killing someone They all died here” That’s why they call it the house of murderers Who told you that? When do we start? Where are you? Where are you? I can’t believe that Has that little bitch really kept that secret from me? Her parents were Satan worshippers? Maybe she doesn’t know anything about that I don’t think many parents would nonchalantly tell their children that they’re Satan worshippers! There’s something I don’t understand though She says the house has always belonged to her family but from what you’ve told me, I would say there have been many owners and it seems it’s been abandoned for more than twenty years! Hey! I paid money! Do you understand? What the hell are you doing? You bitch...! Hey, what’s the matter now? Come on, don’t do that You’ll see, in a few days everything will be over You will use this story while flirting with someone! Nobody will believe me! Joking aside, I don’t think I’ve ever been frightened by anything in my life You’re absolutely right It would have been the perfect scene for a film, right The medium in a trance, doors slamming No. That’s not what scares me... I am scared of myself now. So someone else leaves the scene. The videomaker Yes. I don't blame her, everyone has their own way of thinking She also refused to be interviewed I can imagine And then it is known that seances can be dangerous There was nothing else to do. I was there to help out as I could In any case I was not new to seances I knew I could handle them But the reason why the seances are not recommended is once again the great power of suggestion, right? I repeat, everyone is free to think the way he wants Are you ready? Let's make a chain lease don’t break it for any reason whatsoever or it could be dangerous for me and for all of us Allright I just wanted to ask Therese... why would it be dangerous? I heard that in a lot of films as well, of course but this is not a movie... You would break the flowing of the energy something could be trapped in this dimension And it could be dangerous for me too, if I'm in a trance I'm not sure I completely understand... Something wrong, Erika? Let's keep quiet now Is she in a trance? Therese? Can you hear me? I'm cold I’m so... cold It’s dark it’s... cold I’m... alone Therese... tell what you can see? What the fuck are you doing, you bloody whore! What do you think you’re doing...? What’s happening, Therese? Oh my God! Therese! Therese, are you all right? Therese, are you all right? Therese. You scared the... Oh my God Hey! What’s your problem?! Why did you break the chain? I just couldn’t do it I couldn’t control it! Don’t you remember what she told us? You could have killed her! I'm so sorry! Jenny, I'm not blaming you, I'm just saying that it seems absurd to me this place is famous for the terrible things that happened here and you, the owner, hide everything from me Maybe I shouldn’t have invited you to stay at my place, you know? I should have known you would create troubles. What the hell do you mean? Do you think I'm having fun? And what do you care? You’re thousands of miles away from here and you’ve never been interested in this place I'm sorry... Listen, do what you think is right but do not get into any trouble, okay? Anyway, they must have told you a lot of bullshit! Nothing of what you’ve just said corresponds to the story of my family and my house That’s what I though. But how can this be? I don’t know. I really don’t know. It seems like a fool’s game I gotta go now... Erika... Take care. Fuck off! "Turn right and proceed for ten kilometers to the south-west" They called it “the house of murderers” Seems like a lot of murderers. Seems the house draws them What's happening?... Erika! Stop! I can't bear it! Stop, please! Don’t worry, don’t worry. It’s all over now. So again it seems that you had a strong ascendancy on Erika Are you insinuating something? No, just it seems clear to me that... No, just it seems clear to me that... Look, if you want to stop the interview here, it's okay to me Look, if you want to stop the interview here, it's okay to me You wanted my story of the facts, I didn't think I was under accusation I'm not accusing you of anything, Therese The police carried out their investigations and as far as I know there is nothing against me Let's finish it here, okay? Do I have to remind you that we paid you in advance? I do not accept blackmail! Ok, ok. Calm down Ok, ok. Calm down I'm putting you under stress I'm putting you under stress We interrupt We'll finish tomorrow, ok? Stop Here we are You look tired today You look tired today I didn't sleep well I didn't sleep well I hope not because of me I still apologize for ... Do not worry. The important thing is that we get to the end as soon as possible There is not much left, I think Erika accepts the second seance... You’ve killed me! You’ve killed me! you whore! Therese, do you feel better? What is this? Where is Erika? She run away We have to find her! And you didn't find her Just vanished I see it's painful for you to talk about it But we're done Yes. everyone knows the rest the police arrived, and they told us they were already looking for Erika she was suspected of killing her boyfriend And you? Did you believe it? At the moment it seemed absurd She didn't have the attitude of a person who had just killed someone I mean, she certainly was not a professional murderer, she killed in a rap I don't understand what you mean I mean she was not a bandit used to doing crimes and then pretend nothing happened he was a person like me and you, even more sensitive So for you she had like ... removed her crime she really believed she was innocent Yes. Yes there is no other explanation But then that name ... The house of murderers, the people of the village given to that place... I don't know. I really do not know The police reported that the house in the 70s had been the scene of orgiastic rites that included sacrifices of children I don't know. I really ... I don't know. I really ... So, Therese! You know we went back to you for the powers you say you have So, Therese! You know we went back to you for the powers you say you have You conducted Erika to make seances you told her you hear voices, to see things and now you can only tell us "I don't know"?! What do you want me to say? The house attracted murderers for more than a century and brought them to death? And so also Erika found the house for the same reason? She had no escape? Yes. This is what I think And apparently the blood story of the house dated back to World War II but I think the Evil of the house is more and more ancient it dates back to the ancient riuns and someway those riuns are the key I knew the spirit that infested her would bring her to death Are you happy? However, there is no trace of Erika's death Her footsteps, like those of that man, disappear into air She's missing, not dead I told you what you wanted. That's enough Therese! oh... stop!
