I'm going out of my mind, Mon, playing the same '90s tracks over and over again until the end of time. That's what you get paid to do. It's what the loyal fans want, so we do it. I can't. Not anymore. I hear Australia's pretty good this time of year. Not seen my mom in forever. The tour's nearly over, you can't wait two weeks? There's nothing for me here. Noah, you're a wicked guitarist, but you commit to your music the same way you commit to your tour boyfriends. Quickly, thank you. Come on guys. Come on, guys. Look, I'm sure they didn't mean to ignore you. It was just easier for them to speak to me. I'm just trying to solve the situation. It was just a noise complaint! All right, I'll see you at home. Maybe a little bit louder. I think they heard you. Oh, hi. Hi, we're from the Deaf club up the road. Are you fundraising or...? Sorry, what did she say? We just wanted to talk to our neighbors about any thoughts or concerns they might have in regards to the weekend dances. Thanks again. Hi, Mom. You quit? I thought you'd be happy. Noah, you were finally making it as a guitarist, I just don't quite understand. Do you still play? Sometimes, when I can. That's the thing about arthritis. It doesn't get any better with age. I haven't seen you in years. We Skyped. My God, you're so like him. My body clock's trashed. I'm gonna head out. Thanks for letting me stay. - Another one? - Yeah, thanks, mate. There you go. Thanks. Hello? Hey... I thought this place was a club. Is everything all right? Woah! I didn't mean to... Are you okay? What? I'm Deaf. Sorry... What's your name? Crystal clear to me. I thought this place was a nightclub? And... what kind of music do you play at a Deaf club? Can I hear it? Can I feel it, then? Hey? Okay, one minute. Is this a phone number? Here you go. You look like you've had as much sleep as I did. And what kept you up? Bloody hall down the road. Just keeps blasting music all weekend. It's impossible to get any sleep. Yeah... arseholes. I called the cops last night, thought that would be the end of it, but, oh, no, no. A couple of hours later, it started all over again. Unbearable. You still have one of Dad's old guitars lying around, don't you? Why do you care? I don't know where it is. I guess it's hard to type on your iPad when painting. I wanted to apologize. My mom, I think she's one of the complainers. I feel kinda bad. Hi, I'm Anna. I'm going to interpret for Finn. You can tell your mom she wins. We're going to soundproof the space. Mom has some old moving blankets laying around. Happy to donate them to the cause. You're English? Yeah. My accent didn't give it away? Yeah, right. Deaf. I was born here but raised in Manchester. Why are you here? Quit my band. What's your band's name? Blast From the Past. You won't have heard of us. Is that a Deaf joke? No. No, I wouldn't... I would never do that! Who was that? Hey, no need to bite my head off. I just want to make sure you're being safe. You're... in the middle of... what you're going through. So maybe now is not the best time for a relationship. I'm sorry I didn't correct that woman. Don't you dare be hard on yourself! You put so much time and energy into this club, I mean it's no wonder that you've got no energy left for you. You'll know when you're ready to cut it. I see so much of her in you. And not just the hair. I miss her too. Yeah, I know. It's a bad habit from back home. I don't mean to pry, but... why have you kept your hair long? I don't know, but... isn't cutting all your hair off one of the first things you do? Yeah. I understand. You need anything else? Would you be open to me writing some new music for the club? Nothing. But maybe it wouldn't hurt to try something new. It's not like any of you would know if it sucked, because... That's not fair. Kids' brains are more malleable than adults'. Boyfriend? I thought that meant girlfriend? Boyfriend. Whatever you do choose to do. I wanna be there with ya. I want to go on that journey with ya. That is of course if you want me to. Okay, done. Take a look. Now, you look like a pretty mean dude. I wouldn't mess with ya. So, how's your mother? Shut off. As usual. Is this the break you needed? Could be. I think I've met someone. No! "No"? So, whose heart are you breaking this time? I'm not breaking anyone's heart. Finn. He runs this Deaf club, nightclub place. It's the real deal, then? Finn's trans. I bet Angela will love that. After it took so long for you to convince her you were gay. Yeah. You don't fancy a coffee do you? It's getting a little late. Hot chocolate? C'mon. Mom. Sorry, I didn't know you were in here. I couldn't sleep with that damn racket! You found it. You remember Moniqua? My mom, Angela. That's right, I'm his mother, Angela. I'm sorry? He just got back here. Couldn't you just let him breathe for ten minutes? Mom, what are you doing? I should probably go. Where did that come from? Why did you even come back here if you're just going to leave again? Moniqua is my friend. My mentor. She gives me music and life advice. And I'm your mother. Use me for those things. I'm not going to give up my music. I'll go back out on tour. But for now, I'm here. Well, he left. These left. It was silly of me to expect you to stay. Well, you left for the other side of the world without warning. Why can't I? I was returning home. This isn't your home. No, I guess not. It hurts me with you hanging around with that thing. Let's put it away. I don't need it. If you flatten that 7th, I'll flatten you! Sorry. You cut your hair. It's fine. You didn't do it because that boy asked you to, did you? Well? Did he? I don't want to argue. Look, I know you are trying on this new attitude. But being a man does not mean not being sensible or kind. All of the things you already are. Look. I just want to make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. I just worry. That's my job. I do. I do. All right. I promise. I'll back off. Would they be willing to perform? Because someone like that could bring a whole stack of new people. We could have an open day. No, it'll be fine. "Moni-qua"? "Mon-i-qua"? Moniqua. Well, it needs work. Yeah, it's tricky. It's gonna need to have a lot of bass, but not be too obnoxious. And you want me to perform it with you? I don't know if it's my thing. Let me work on it. I know you'll love it. Better than never-ending '90s pop? I'm sorry I was a shit, Mon. But I think I'm ready. I want to go back on tour with ya. The next one's a 12-month tour. And what makes you think I'd even take you back? Because it will be different. What's changed? My comps are getting better. I don't just want to be a guitarist, Mon. Join me on tour, but... don't quit on me. And I'll help you with the composition. Deal. But, I want to test run you first. I have this Sydney gig coming up. Will you accompany me for that? I've only got this at the minute. Ah, it'll do. It's fine. It's shitty but charming. Just like you. Whoo-hoo! C'mon! You're gonna have to come and get me. It's perfect. Whoo! Come on! What are you saying? Decision... Doctors... See you... Can't wait. To prove what? I'll be there tomorrow. Promise. Sorry. I can put it away if... Oh, no need. No point in hiding it away for my sake. I just needed a guitar. This is good. It means I'm ready to go back out on tour again. Of course you are. Is it that hard for you to be proud of me? Where were you last night? Mm? Yeah. I'm seeing someone. His name is Finn. He runs the Deaf club. Oh. Hannah. Finn. How does that work? I'm not doing this with you. I hope you clarified that it's only a summer fling. I mean it's only a matter of time before you're leaving, isn't it? All this because I wanted his guitar? Noah, what does he mean to you? I gave up everything for him and us. He left us. If it bothers you that much, I'll get rid of it. Shit. You don't have your guitar anymore? Can't you just call in a favor? It's not a big deal. - Hey, Brett. - Hey. If you'd told me sooner, then maybe. Honestly, this is just easier. Hey, man, you did the last tour with Moniqua, yeah? Yeah, most of it. Listen, Mon, I still really want to be a part of this gig tonight. Look, Brett's already here. And he's reliable. I can't ask him to give his guitar to you. I'll do this Sydney gig, and then we'll talk, okay? Sorry I'm late. Doesn't matter, I'm here now. I'm sorry, calm down. I think I made a mistake. Drowned my guitar. I was working on a song. My way of speaking for you. Well, it's bound to be an improvement on that bass. You were determined to give the neighborhood permanent ear damage. God forbid someone would want to live with ear damage, Noah! What a tragedy! We all know the worst possible thing that could happen is someone has hearing loss! Keep it down, it's too loud. No, it's too loud! And what the hell was that? You cut the lessons short for paying members! Members we need to keep your club alive. What if half of them don't come back? You can't have the music that loud. Don't you understand we hand out earplugs for a reason? Cut it out! Stop this, Hannah! Here. Eat. So... You haven't told him you're leaving? Look, you don't have to come on tour. Yes, I do. I made you a promise, Mon. I'm not going to be this flakey piece of shit anymore. And your promise to Finn? Clean breaks are better though, right? Loving and leaving seems crueler, doesn't it? And do you? It was only a matter of time before all your flailing about caught up with you. What do you mean? Well, if somethings not working for you, you change gears and move on without a second thought. What!? One mother is bad enough! I'm trying to help. Noah...? No! You want to talk about it? You and Noah have a fight? Would it be awkward if I changed my mind about him? Because I've seen a change in you. You're happy. Eat up. Hi, how are you going? Where do we start? You would have been one of the best if you had stayed and kept playing. I returned home. Where else should I have been? With me. You were an adult. You made it perfectly clear that you wanted to spread your wings. I still needed ya. And I needed him. We don't always get what we want, Noah. Anyway. It's in the past. The most important thing is that you're here with me... No. We can't keep doing this to each other. No. Don't bother. I'm going back on tour, Finn. To England. Week or so? Now. I'm telling you now. Finn, it's a lot! You're a lot. I made Mon a promise. Finn... Finn... Finn! Oh. Finn, is it? I really... I really like the smell of this one. Reminds me of some rugged, country bloke. I've just been over the club's books again. They're not improving. We need a busload of people to turn up on open day. Now it just needs lyrics. Have you guys done anything like this before?
