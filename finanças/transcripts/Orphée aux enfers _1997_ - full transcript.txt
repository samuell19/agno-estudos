Who am I? I am an improvement on the chorus of ancient theatre; I am Public Opinion, a symbolic personage, and what you might call a stickler. The ancient chorus took it upon itself to explain to people what they' already understood, if they were intelligent. I go one better;. I play a part myself and, as I take part in the action, I apportion praise or blame. A woman should beware of me if she intends to betray her husband, and so should the husband who wants to pull a stroke on his wife!. It's to the characters in the drama that I?m speaking, rest assured! Here comes our Eurydice;, I?m off... but I'll be there all the time, ready to appear from the wings like a "Deus ex machina". The woman with a dream in her heart cannot sleep;, every day she rises with the sun. At morning, the flowers which line the meadows are more beautiful. "But for whom are these flowers?" you ask! Do you? For whom? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Don't say anything to my husband, to my husband, but they are for the handsome shepherd who lives just here, who lives just here, who lives just here, don't say anything to my husband, don't say anything to my husband. Every day like this I bring the lovely shepherd beautiful cornflowers, which I tremblingly hang on his door, and my poor heart throbs and races. So for whom does it beat so fast? Do you ask? Do you? For whom? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Don't say anything to my husband, to my husband, but they are for the handsome shepherd who lives just here, who lives just here, who lives just here, don't say anything to my husband, don't say anything to my husband. He's out! When he comes back I'll make sure his house is strewn with flowers. What's this? Isn't that the lovely nymph Maquilla whom I adore? She's alone! I shall reveal my presence singing. La la la la la... Hell! My husband! -Damnation! It's my wife! How silly! I?d better start shouting before she does! Ah! Madame, you are caught! By whom pray? For what? -For what? rather for whom are those flowers, pray? -What flowers? Ah! for the sun, for the wind; and for whom is this passionate tune on your scratch box? For the moon. -For the moon, fine, -we all love the moon! Well, do you know, what I think, my dear? that if I've got my shepherd, you?ve got your shepherdess. So, you can have your shepherdess but leave me my shepherd. Come! Madame, what you are saying is in bad taste! -Why would that be? Because... Really! I?m going red! -Ha! Ha! Really! But if that colour doesn't suit you, we'll find you another. Eurydice! -Ah, no! -I mean, it's time to reveal, at last! Listen, I?m going to tell you the truth, maestro Orpheus, my pure, blushing husband! Listen, I detest you! I thought I was marrying an artist, and I've hitched myself to the most boring man in creation. You think, you're a poet because you invented the hexameter! I hate hexameters, I hate dreams and classical hymns, and above all, above all that execrable instrument there! My violin! Don't put you finger on that string, Madame! I?m bored with your violin! Go and play to those third-rate shepherdesses you like so much, and charm them! Go on! As for me, I?m the daughter of a nymph and a demi-god, I must have freedom, I must have fantasy! I must have... Today I?m in love with this shepherd, he loves me, nothing will separate me from Aristaeus! Ah! So that's it! Yes, dear! As your husband, you are deceiving me? -Yes, dear, yes, dear! As an artist, you scorn me? -Yes, dear, yes, dear! As a violinist, you don't like me? -No, dear, no, dear, as a violinist you seem dire to me; as an instrumentalist you're boring; and your instrument, your instrument I find hugely displeasing. Ah! for your insolence I shall have my revenge! And how, and how, how, pray? I am going, sweetheart, to play you forthwith a work of genius, my latest concerto! Mercy, mercy, I beg you! -No, no, it cannot wait, it is the pinnacle of my art, it lasts an hour and a quarter! For heaven's sake, an hour and a quarter! -An hour and a quarter! It's the pinnacle of my art! -I shan't listen. -Oh yes you will. I shan't listen. -Oh yes you will! No, no, no, no, no! Mercy! Mercy! ah! It's deplorable, it's frightful, -It's adorable, it's delectable, it's so boring, it's so irritating... -it's ravishing, it's enthralling... Ah! ah! ah! ah! It's so boring, it's so irritating, ah! Ah! It's charming, it's ravishing! It's so boring, it's so irritating, ah! Ah! It's charming, it's ravishing! Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! -ah! ravishing, ah! ah! ah! It's so boring, it's so irritating, boring! Just listen to this motif, so languorous and expressive! Gnagnagnagnagnagna! It's so boring, it's so irritating! No, I just don't want to hear! -Ah! it's so sweet! Ah! so tender! No, it's horrible, it's terrible! Quel tr?molo! -Ah! Presto, presto! -Ah! Largo, largo! -Ah! Pizzicato, pizzicato! it's terrible, it's terrible, -Presto, presto! Amoroso! Agitato! ah! La la la, la, la... -Oh, Lord! Ah, what torment! It's over, he's gone! O Venus, be good to me, save me from my husband! -...Ia la la, la, la. Ah, what torment! It's over, he's gone! Oh, Lord! save me from my husband, save me from my husband! ah! Oh, Venus, fair goddess, save me from Orpheus, and I'll make you a sacrifice of ten lambs whiter than milk! -Oh! Jupiter, lord of the thunder, free me from Eurydice, and I will sing your praises on my four-stringed lyre. Madame, I can deceive myself no longer! When a woman has come to... this, it is perfectly useless to try and put her back n the straight and narrow... Perfect! So let's separate! -Ah, I?d gladly do that... Ah! But my reputation... I need people's respect. I am an slave to Public Opinion: it's my weakness, allow me to keep it. As for your follower, I?ll blow him apart! -With your bow? No, and I?m not telling you how... just one thing: he shouldn't frolic among the corn, as he has been doing since he came from who knows where to live in my district. -And who's is going to stop him? -Who! a little surprise that I?ve sown for him among these golden ears here! Meaning? -Nothing! That's all! Well, I?m off to give my lessons at the Orpheon... Farewell, my lovely, a little surprise sown for him, there. Take care. Adieu! I?m afraid! What does he mean, this surprise sown among the golden ears? A trap, perhaps! a man-trap! he is that jealous! And Aristaeus, he always comes across this corn field to meet me and frolic with me. Let's go to meet him! The poor thing will bring some harm upon himself! Quickly! Quickly! It's me, Aristaeus, an Arcadian shepherd, a honey-maker, crazy about music, who knows how to be satisfied with the innocent pleasures that the gods allow the country-dweller, to watch my swarm of bees hovering among the trellises between earth and sky as they collect the honey, to watch dawn breaking and, each morning, to say to oneself: I hope, I can see it again tomorrow, I can see it again tomorrow: that's the joy, that's the joy of a simple soul, the true happiness, the true happiness of a tender heart. Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! To watch the little lambs gamboling on the plain, leaving bits of white wool on all the bushes, to watch the shepherdess as she sleeps whilst softly, softly, the shepherd she likes comes up to surprise her, the shepherd she likes comes up to surprise her! That's the joy, that's the joy of a simple soul, the true happiness, the true happiness of a tender heart. Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! There! That's what I say to inspire confidence! But if you knew who I am and what infernal plans I?m hatching! If the idea I?ve put in Orpheus's mind succeeds, today we'll score a big hit! Ah, there's that sweet Eurydice, let's not seem to have come through the cornfield. -I can't see him. -Coo-ee! Ah! There he is! I?ve arrived in time! Aristaeus! My shepherd! Be careful! Of what? -Of yourself! -Why? -Quiet! Speak more softly! All right! I?m going to... -Aristaeus! My shepherd! Don't move! But if I can't speak to you, nor even get near you, then we won't be able to have a chat... I don't know... Let's talk body-language! -Aristaeus! In the name of our love, come no closer! -But what timidity! You usually play hard to get, but only within reason... -Stop! If you take a step, you are dead! My husband knows everything. He has been spying on us, he has laid traps among these crops which have witnessed our love. -Bah! It's true! -He's told her about it, -the idiot! I?ll have to make good his blunder... Shall I tell you? -Tell me! Well then! It's fiddlesticks, stuff and nonsense. -Nonsense! I'm telling you, he's furious... he has sworn to finish you... Ah! -But look how I laugh at his traps, Look... -Aristaeus! You are carried -away by your love and your courage! You are rushing to your death! -There's no danger, and in any case, what wouldn't I do to be with you again? -Well then, I want to die with you! -Come on then! I want to die with you! -Come on then! Ah! -Crack! There we are! I?m caught! -And more than you think! God, what is this feeling? Pluto, become yourself again! One, two, tree! And now, let's put the elements in a whirl! Yes, yes! At home, that's how we put the elements in a whirl. Mighty gods! Am I going to die? Completely! Lasciate ogni speranza! But it isn't hurting... -I?ll explain why... It's strange... -It's logical! Death appears to me smiling, coming to strike me while I'm near you. It draws me, tempts me... Death, I call to you, carry me off! Death, I call to you, carry me off! Death, your rapture imbues me, your chill does not harm me, it seems as if I?ll be born again, yes, born again instead of dying, yes, born again, born again instead of dying! There! That's fine! One tear, and we're off! But first, let's abuse our divine power by throwing out at last challenge to the husband! Here's a pen and writing materials! I?m leaving your side because I have died, comma, Aristaeus is Pluto and to the devil I go! The rhyme isn't very riche... but wealth doesn't bring happiness. And now!... to the dark shores! Now then! But what the devil's going on up there? I leave my classes at three o'clock and I arrive home at dead of night! I haven't had dinner, and it's already supper-time! So what's all this upset? There must be an eclipse! By Jupiter! What's the meaning of this? My wife's writing! I?m leaving your side because I have died, comma, Aristaeus is Pluto and to the devil I go! What! That means she's dead! My god, that's not possible! But what if she... is really dead! She says so herself! Thank you! Thank you! Jupie! Someone there! No, no-one! I?m free! Oh, happiness! Oh bliss! Let's go, let's go and tell my beloved nymph! Anathema, anathema, on him who without pity, anathema, anathema, sheds not one tear for his other half. Strange cries! Strange cries! Anathema, anathema, on him who without pity... Those voices again! -anathema, anathema, sheds not one tear for his other half... -Those voices again! -anathema, anathema. On all sides at once! What an acoustical miracle! What an acoustical miracle! Anathema, anathema, -Anathema! Anathema, anathema, on him who without pity, anathema, anathema, sheds not one tear for his other half, anathema, anathema, sheds not one tear for his other half. Anathema, anathema! Heavens! Public Opinion is after me already! Heavens! Public Opinion is after him already! Heavens! Public Opinion -Heavens! Public Opinion is after me, is after me already, already! Here is Public Opinion, proclaiming what she knows, for right off the beaten track she can pick up the trace of a serious crime, and sys to the sacrilegious hand: it was you who set the trap among the corn! Stop! Stop! This can't be allowed, no, it can't be allowed to happen! Stop! Stop! This can't be allowed, no, it can't be allowed to happen! Unworthy spouse, my wrath will pursue you in every possible way, I shall put you in penury, make you lose your teaching and, from dusk to dawn, disturbing your nights, I shall cry: Stop! Stop! This can't be allowed, no, it can't be allowed to happen! Stop! Stop! This can't be allowed, no, it can't be allowed to happen! Come! It is useless to resist Opinion! Away! It is useless to resist Opinion! Mercy! -To extricate you from my severity and provide an example for posterity there is only one way out for you! Which is, pray? -Obviously, to chase after your wife! But I don't love her! -So to everyone's eyes the example will seem that much more glorious! Never was a fate... ah! ah! ah! more dire! Chase, chase after your wife! -Chase, chase after your wife! I see I must give way to your implacable voice. Come, come, come, come, come! It is honour which calls you, and honour comes before love, before love, before love, come! I shall be your constant companion both going and coming back! Come! But this honour which calls me, alas! is playing me a dirty trick, a dirty trick. Damn the constant guide who will follow me till I come back, -I shall be your constant companion who will follow me till I come back! -both going and coming back! Let's be off, let's be off, let's be off, let's be off...! ah! come! But this honour which calls me, -It is honour which calls you, alas! is playing me a dirty trick... -and honour comes before love... a dirty trick, honour is playing me... -before love, yes, honour comes... but this honour which calls me... -it is honour which calls you... but this honour which calls me... -it is honour which calls you... yes, is playing me a dirty trick... -comes before, before love... Let's sleep, sleep, let there never be an end of it, since the only pleasure, after all, on our Olympus is to sleep. Let's sleep, sleep, let there never be an end of it. I?m Cupid, and my love has been playing truant! I?m coming home at daybreak from a little trip to Cythera! Profound secrecy shrouds my return! They are all asleep! Let's go to sleep! Let's go to sleep! Let's go to sleep! Let's go, let's go to sleep! Ah!... I?m Venus, and my love has been playing truant! I?m coming home at daybreak from a little trip to Cythera! Profound secrecy shrouds my return! They are all asleep! Let's go to sleep! Let's go to sleep! Let's go to sleep! Let's go, let's go to sleep! Ah!... By Saturn! What's that noise awakening us in the middle of the night? Who wakes us up in the middle of night? It's Diana, my beloved daughter, sounding us her alarm! Ho! Wake up immediately! Ah!... And whatever else, no yawning! With cries of joy and pleasure, that's the way to greet the goddess: please follow the rule! Hail to Diana the huntress! Hail to Diana! But why this air of sadness? Why this air of sadness? Ah! Nothing can equal my torment, no, nothing can equal my torment, ah! my torment! When Diana goes down on to the plain, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, it's look for Actaeon there, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, it's near the clear fountain, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, that Diana meets Actaeon, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, tantiwy, That Diana meets Actaeon! that Diana meets Actaeon! -That Diana meets Actaeon! Now, this morning as I left the plain, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, I went to look for Actaeon, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, but alas! near the fountain, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, my Actaeon was nowhere to be seen, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, tantiwy, tarrah, tantiwy, Her Actaeon was nowhere to be seen! my Actaeon was nowhere to be seen! -Her Actaeon was nowhere to be seen! Ah! Poor Actaeon! What has become of him? Him, hidden under a shrub, while... Oh! I saw it quite clearly! -What has become of him? I?ll tell you! You compromised yourself with that young man, so I got rid of him. But how? -I changed him into a stag! Eh? -A stag. And to save your reputation, chaste Diana, I have spread the rumour among the mortals, that it was you who wanted me to... put Actaeon out of action; I said you found his curiosity indiscreet... -No way! -I said it for the honour of mythology! My children, the mortals have their eye on us! Let's keep up appearances, at least! It's all about keeping up appearances! As for that, you keep them up well enough! -Has he been on some new escapade? -But no, my dear... tittle-tattle... it's the journalists... they put about rumours... -Rumours... Rumours... I know there's something up. I'm sure there's a Gorgon in the woodpile, I'm sure of it, go on! Tell me, Diana, if you know... Please, a little decorum! No scenes in front of people! Leave me to look after the internal affairs of Olympus. I get complaints from all quarters. Look! Moans, complaints, recriminations! Olympus is on its way out, my children! You are ruining it with your feckless behaviour! What a bully! -Cupid? Where is the little? -Here! Ah, you urchin, if you carry on as usual you'll make us angry. -What a bore! Infuriating old Jupiter! Go on! If you gave me wings it was so I could flutter. If I gave you wings it was so you would get a move on, and you're always late. What time did you come in? Do it again and I?ll put you on bread and water for a week. Come! Everyone to his task, until it's time to taste the nectar and ambrosia... And I want no-one absent from lunch... Come on! I?ve heard rumours, several times now I?ve noticed... -Mummy, do you think this can last? He's really getting us down! -Me most of all. This Olympus depresses me! -What if we rebelled? -I?ve an idea. We'll refuse to... What are you mumbling about over there in the corner! Didn't you hear me, then? 'Pon my thunder! It's hard to be a team leader. It's driving me off my head! And as if that wasn't enough... I also have to endure the jealousy of my dear wife... Here we go! Her again! Clings like a leech! I was just telling Cupid to settle down... whereas she could do to get out of her rut a bit... It's you! My sunshine! What's to do? -What's to do is -that I can't go on living like this! And that the existence you make me lead. -Let's see then, now what have I done? Ah! don't try to deceive me. Rumours from earth reach me up here. Not again... -Well, now! there is talk down there on the disappearance of a mortal woman, who is as beautiful as a goddess and has been carried off by a god. This woman is called Eurydice... And the god is called... you! -Me? And who else but you would have dared? See, my love, see where your blind passion leads you! I know about this just as you do! -That I believe. I have my suspicions about who it is, and we shall soon know... -Fiddlesticks... I?ve sent Mercury to gather intelligence and if my suspicion are well-founded you will shortly see that a god like me, who punishes the escapades of others, must be the most faithful and constant husband... -I can't believe you any longer, you great hypocrite! You've betrayed me so many times! All right then! as you wish! What do you want me to say? Wait! I can hear the chromium-plated wings of Mercury. Listen, and then pass judgment on me! Hip-hop! Hip-hop! Make way for Mercury! His feet don't touch the ground, his carriage is a blue cloud, and he's unstoppable in flight... In his dictionary Bouillet gives my numerous titles: I am the messenger of the goddesses and gods; I?m the one who works for their love affaires, active, agile, intelligent, my wand is my badge, a bright silver badge. Hip-hop! Hip-hop! Make way for Mercury! His feet don't touch the ground, his carriage is a blue cloud, and he's unstoppable in flight... I am the god of eloquence, barristers are my children, they are an immense help to me in stitching up the mortals. As the god of commerce I have to detest fraud and deceit, but conversely I?m inclined, as god of theft, to favour them, playing my hand quite deviously, and sometimes overreaching myself: when Apollo was Admetus' herdsman I pinched his oxen. I?m the god of rogues, and the most roguish of the gods, I?ve wings on my shoulders, on my heels an in my hair. Jupie, my master, puts me up to all sort of tricks; he'll end up putting me into a barometer to tell him what the weather will be like. Hip-hop! -Hip-hop! Hip-hop! Hip-hop! Hip-hop! Make way for Mercury! His feet don't touch the ground, his carriage is a blue cloud, and he's unstoppable in flight.... his carriage is a blue cloud, and he's unstoppable in flight, he's unstoppable in flight, in flight! Hail to the mighty master of the gods... -No titles! Give me a report on your mission. -Lord, I've come -on the fast track from the Underworld! And Pluto? Was he reigning there in all his glory? -It wasn't Pluto who was reigning there! It was open merriment that reigned. They were having a lovely time down there! And I had a really agreeable little break! -And Pluto? He has gone out! -All morning? For a fortnight! -He'd stayed out? Seems so! -And you didn't see him? Yes! He came back to the Underworld an hour ago. -Where had he come from? From earth! -Alone? Oh, no! With a pretty young woman whom he had just snatched from her husband! Do you know her name? -Eurydice. There! I didn't tell him to say that! That's delightful! -Not for all of us! -That rascal Pluto! And is he coming? Yes, I told him you were waiting! I can hear the engine of his chariot. Perfect! I?ll give him the treatment he deserves! Let me receive him! Tell me you're not fooling me, Ernest? There's nothing else? But no, my darling! -At last, things are improving. I?m going to eat! Leech! Go to see if they come! This little Eurydice, then, is she very pretty? My lord, here he is! My lord, here he is! Hail to the mighty master of heaven and earth! Enough! Enough! I waive the platitudes! -Madame is well? -She's eating again! How he looks at me! Could he perhaps have doubts? Let's deflect his suspicions! I?ll toady him. I?ll pretend to find his home attractive. I happen to have here a good speech I read somewhere... Ah! With what voluptuous pleasure I inhale the beguiling emanations of this sweet, life-giving atmosphere of Olympus! Happy the divinities who frolic endlessly beneath ever-blue skies! Whilst I am condemned to the dark cesspools of the infernal, of the infernal kingdom, here the air is perfumed by goddesses and nymphs, a gentle scent of myrtle and verbena, of nectar and ambrosia! Here is heard the whirring of doves, of doves, the songs of Apollo, and Lesbos' lyre, Lesbos' lyre. Here are Muses, here Nymphs, the Graces, the Graces, the Graces are not far off, no, no! No, no! No, no! the Graces are not far off! You will see them dance, gamboling peacefully under the soft light of night, of night and day! Here is heard the whirring of doves, of doves, the songs of Apollo, and Lesbos' lyre, Lesbos' lyre. Every perfume is released... the perfumes of night, and... day, the perfumes of morning, and... evening, the perfumes of heaven, the perfumes of the Graces, the perfumes of the Muses, and the perfumes of the Nymphs. Have you quite finished with your perfumery? He's going to splash it all over me, he's in a lather! -Well then? One can never sing your happiness sufficiently! -You pretend, you do, to believe that happiness is found in the realm of the Graces and the Nymphs! That's not my opinion! I am not of a nymphatic nature! But be that as it may! Lend me an attentive ear! King of the Underworld, it is I who have called you here! Now, it seems that you are behaving like the ultimate rascal! -My Lord! That you're living like a pasha! But first of all, what's all that? -That's my lunch, a little something-just-in-case, that goes everywhere with me: a bottle of old Cyprus wine, a sausage... and a flagon of fire-water "vite spirit"! Wine! A sausage... -de Lyon! And we up here are eternally condemned to nectar and ambrosia! And is that your usual fare? -Yes! Oh, I don't like bland things! I must have spice! -Then you are the happiest of gods! Me, my lord! Happy! -You! What have -you been doing for the last fortnight? I live in the dark cesspool of the Underworld. Unlike here, down there... That's your story! You've been living in a hut on the outskirts of Thebes. You've abused your power by striking a wife dead and snatching her from her husband. Me, my lord! I?m extremely... -I know everything! -It's not true! When I speak, you shut up! I?m not accustomed to having discussions! Before me, all trembles... What's that? It doesn't sound much like cries of obedience, or shouts of enthusiasm! To arms, gods and demi-gods! To arms, gods and demi-gods! We must bring down this tyranny. This regime is boring! To arms! To arms! To arms! To arms! To arms! This regime is boring! A rebellion, a rebellion, how strange! A rebellion of the gods! 'Pon my soul, just at the right time! Plus de nectar! plus d'ambroisie! -No more nectar! That liquor which makes one heart-sick! -Yes, heart-sick! That's enough sugar and ambrosia! -No more ambrosia! They are right! This diet is insipid! Tell me about it, about it, comrades! To arms! -To arms! -To arms! To arms, gods and demi-gods! To arms, gods and demi-gods! We must bring down this tyranny. This regime is boring! To arms! To arms! To arms! No more nectar or ambrosia! We must bring down this tyranny. This regime is boring! To arms! To arms! No more nectar! No more nectar! Sedition! You are refusing to obey! -Yes! You are losing respect for Papa 'Piter! So! You don't like living on nectar and ambrosia? -No! No! No more nectar!... We're pickled in it! -We've got barley-sugar in our veins! They're right! -So it's a rebellion? -And you're not ashamed to take as your leader a bandit like him? -A bandit! My lord! I?m not a bandit! -Yes! a miserable fellow who abuses his position to take mortal woman from their husbands! -It isn't true! You want names? -Yes, -you've brought up names, so name names! We will name names! He has just snatched the young wife of the fiddler Orpheus, the lovely Eurydice. -It isn't true! -So, is that all? What do you mean, is that all? What about morals? -Then we must take into account your morals! You've done a lot more of it yourself, daddy... There! What did I say? -Moi? Never... -good father, good husband... Yes! Let's talk about your domesticated qualities! I don't want to sow seeds of discord. We're a family group, and top-ranking gods. So let's be frank! You reproach me for what I?ve done, and what if we brought up what you've done? Say no more! I know all about what's gone on on your side! -And me! And us as well! -We've made up a song -about it! -I?d better be off! I?ve a meeting with my astrologer... -Stay and listen! -Stay and listen! That will be your punishment! That will be your punishment! To seduce the proud Alcmene, you got yourself up as her spouse! I know plenty of women on earth with him whom that wouldn't work! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! That marital-disguise ploy served you well again when you snatched Europa by putting on a bull's horns! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! To your beloved Danae you one day appeared as a shower, but made of golden rain: she enjoyed the rain, and you worshipped her! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! That swan trapped by an eagle, which Leda saved by cradling it in her arms, that was you again, you old rogue! I was that eagle, so don't deny it! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! What do these metamorphoses prove? That you thought you were so ugly that to get loved you didn't dare show yourself as you were made! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know about your tricks, Jupie! Ha-ha...! Don't act so goody-goody: we know you, Jupie! I?m at the end of my tether! Ah, traitor! Ah, fickle man! Don't come near me! I hate you! I want divorce! We're separating! A nervous breakdown! There was nothing I could do! -Take your wife, then! The swan, I swear that was before we were married! Ah! don't talk to me about swans! -But do take your wife! This all gossip, pure gossip! I?ve only ever loved you! You are just a slanderer! Just a... -Don't go on! and please take your wife! She's embarrassing me! -Lord! -What! -There are two strangers, asking for an audience! -Their names? Orpheus. -Orpheus! Him, here! Take your wife, then! Eh, I don't have her! Orpheus! I?ll corner him again! -And a -woman who calls herself Public Opinion. Public Opinion! Oh, these mortals! Children, enough of our arguments! Don't see them! -See them! -I?m going to see them! Ah! -I'm Jove and I must have justice! Ah, ah! you tremble! -Me, my lord! I?m not trembling! I?m strong, I?ll brazen it out! Show them in! Giving orders in my domain! Allow them to enter the sanctum! We must get into our appointed places. Public Opinion is present! We must behave well! Where is my throne? Where is my thunder? I want my Sunday thunder! Come on! Venus, on my right! Diana, on my left! And me? -You! Get over there, in the dock! And me? -You! Where you like! -You'll be a sight wherever you are. Perfect! The group will be fine like that! Allow them to enter the sanctum! -No! Show them in! -What a tease! He's coming! He's getting nearer! There he is, yes, it's definitely him! Ah, damnation! I?m starting to get really fed up with it here, to get really fed up with it here! -He's coming! He's getting nearer! And I am quite overwhelmed -There he is, yes, it's definitely him! this whole trip is beginning -They're going to take your part, to give me far too much trouble. -oh dear, most unfortunate husband! Here he is! -We're waiting! It's really him! -And watching! Forward! Forward! Do as I say! Le voil?! -We're looking! C'est bien lui! -We're watching! Your vengeance is quite close, come on! (PUBLIC OPINION:... Do as I say, keep going! Beware my vengeance!... yes, ready to fall on you!...) -(ORPHEUS: My vengeance is quite close! Yes, it's a bore, yes, that damned old man is starting to get on my nerves...) (CHOR./DIA./CUP./VEN.) : Yes, let's look, and also listen! For he's/l 'm going to take your part, most unfortunate husband! What do you wish of me, puny mortal? The solemn moment has arrived! You will, in a voice full of tenderness, implore of great Jupiter the right to take back from the Underworld your dear and tender wife! Must l? -Go on! They have stolen away my Eurydice... Naught can equal his torment! Naught can equal his sorrow! Naught can equal his sorrow! And the wife-stealer is...? -Is...? It's Pluto! -It's Pluto! It's Pluto! It's Pluto! It's Pluto! Justly punishing the crime and the injustice, I condemn Pluto to give him back Eurydice! Oh heavens! He's given her back to me! Oh heavens! He's taking her away from me! And to see that my supreme will is observed, I shall today, Pluto, go to Hell myself! To Hell! -To Hell! To Hell! -To Hell! To Hell! Jupie, take us with you, please! Take us with you... Jupie! -Jupie! -Jupie! Jupie, take us, take us with you! Come, I'll take the whole of Olympus! Long live Jupie! Long live Jupie! Come on, all of you! Come on, all of you! Glory, glory to Jupiter, glory to this sweet, clement god, who, leaving for the scintillating underworld, can't bear to go without us! Let's go, let's go, let's go! La la la la la, Let's go, let's go, let's go!... Let's go, let's go, come on! La la la la la, let's go, let's go... La la la la la, let's go, come on, let's go, come on! Ah! No more nectar, no more blue sky! Oh, we'll have a bit of a laugh, Farewell, contentment, farewell to love! -thanks, my god, thanks, my god! La la la la la, let's go, let's go, let's go!... Let's go, let's go, come on! La la la la la, let's go, let's go... La la la la la...! Pick up your a... your attributes, let's go, don't hesi... don't hesitate! Pick up your a... your attributes, let's go, don't hesi... don't hesitate! Let's go, let's go, don't hesitate, -Thank you, thank you! La la la la la, let's go, let's go, let's go!... Yes, let's go, let's go, let's go... No more nectar, no more blue sky! Oh, we'll have a bit of a laugh, Farewell, contentment, farewell to love! -thanks, my god, thanks, my god! La la la la la, let's go, let's go, let's go!... Let's go, let's go, come on! La la la la la, let's go, let's go... La la la la la...! Still no-one! No news! Oh dear! It's intolerable! I'm frightfully bored here! Ah, what a sad fate the divine Pluto has given me here! To leave me abandoned and alone! What's the meaning of this neglect? When I came here with him he was awash with tenderness! Ah, but if this goes on I shall be missing my husband, I shall be missing my husband. Ah why yes, ah why yes, ah, I shall be missing my husband. I shall be missing my husband. Ah why yes, ah why yes! The love of the gods, the traitor said, has indescribable pleasures! I?m going to introduce you to them, he said... Could it be the gods are unreliable? So where is the unheard-of rapture I was supposed to enjoy here? Ah, but if this goes on, I?ll be missing my husband, I?ll be missing my husband! Ah, yes, ah yes, ah yes, ah, I?ll be missing my husband, I'll be missing my husband, Ah, yes, ah yes, ah yes! Two whole days I've been alone, with no other distraction than the company of a domestic who they've made into my gaoler! Ah, Pluto, be careful! You don't know what boredom can do to a woman as volatile as I am! So that's how he loves me! I really am going to miss my husband! Someone... Oh, no, it's him again! She really is pretty! very pretty! Ah, if only I dared! You again; what do you want with me? -Madame didn't ring? -Me? No. Pity! -Why? Because if Madame had rung, that would have been because she needed something. And as Madame didn't ring, that means Madame doesn't need anything. -Gnagnagnagna! She's rally pretty! My God, she is pretty! Will Madame be ringing soon? How do I know? Why? -Because if Madame rung, I?d rush to... Ah! I?m so unhappy, Madame! -What has that to do with me? As Madame shows an interest in me, I will tell her everything. Madame, I have a tender heart and weak head. The woman who loved me would be very happy! He's mad! He wants to tell me about his love-life! However, I have one fault; I prefer to tell you about it straight away so that you won't reproach me with it later, Madame: I sometimes drink, I said, sometimes! -He's not mad, he's tiddly! Now, Madame, you know me... as if you had made... Ah, get off! this is frightful! -You repulses me after such an avowal? Is it because I?m only a domestic? That's great ladies for you, all the same! But I didn't die so I could wear this livery, Madame, not me! When I was on earth, I was the son of a prince of Boeotia! Very well! There's still something rather Boeotian about you! When I was King of Boeotia, I had subjects, soldiers... but one day, when I lost my life, I lost all these advantages, alas! However, I don't miss them at all; what I regret today is that I didn't choose you to bestow all my love on! When I was King of Boeotia! When I was King of Boeotia! If I were King of Boeotia, you would be Queen, I promise you. Now I can only in semblance offer you my royal power. The most noble shade, my dear, can only give what it has, so accept, I beg you, in its present form, the heart of a King of Boeotia, the heart of a King of Boeotia. Go away, I say, you smell of wine... -Oh, what funny idea! That's because I told you just now that I drink from time to time... But you don't know what it is that fuddles me, it's water... just pure water! -Water! Yes, and not just any old water, but the water of the River Lethe... oh yes, I drink in order to forget, to forget the sorry state into which I have fallen! What a weird idea! -It's the idea of a free man, the idea of a proud man, who remembers his past splendour... True enough, this habit sometimes hinders me in my work, for example, when my master gives me an order, I drink, through pride, before obeying him. So then I forget the order he gave me... He gives me the order again, so I have another drink, I forget again, and it goes on like that for days on end... Mind you, he doesn't care, he thinks, I'm intelligent... But there's one thing I could never forget, even if I drank the whole of the Lethe, and that's the adorable woman. Oh, my lord! the radiant woman, oh la la la la! of whom I?ve been put in charge for the last two days... Insolence! -One thing I would like -to forget, on the other hand... that's my duties! -Ah! Ah, Madame! Tut, my master! You must go back in! -I don't want! -It's orders! You'll get me the sack! -Listen, though, how long will this joke be going on? -I'll tell you later! Come on! She's not there! He's had time to hide her away! Phew! I can breath again... You've got funny ways of welcoming people to your house! -Who? Me? Yes, you. To be polite, one let's the other person go in first, and then follows him in. Where are we now? -We are in my little pad, my buen retiro, if you like. When I?m tired out by running my infernal kingdom, this is where I come for peace and solitude. Solitude. I?m sure she's here... Are you looking for something, O mighty god? -Nothing, no, thank you. I'm studying the construction of this... what did you call it just now? Buen retiro. -Bravo! Yes, I find it very nice, very intimate. What are you doing there? You're making signs to someone! What's that? -Eh? Who? That! That beanpole! -Ah! Oh, him. It's John Styx, my domestyx, my factotum, a good lad, who I trust with my... -Your secrets? Where is she? You still think it was I who snatched the little woman! -Absolutely! Let me pass, or I?ll thunder! Ah! Search, search, mighty god! Nothing!... Nothing! Nothing at all! Ah! if... there... a lock! She's in there! I'm sure of it! 'Pon my immortality, in some form or other, I must get in there! You're right, nothing! So let's go back up to the gods at the party I?ve prepared; ah! it's a lovely party! -Let's go. My compliments to you... That mortal was a fool to himself. -One word and I?ll lock you up... I?ve an idea! Let's leave my card... And in two seconds I?ll be back. But I?d have to change myself, this time I?d have to be the most elegant, the smallest, the slightest thing. Oh, I don't know! -Don't lose sight of him, he might come back... -But I'll find a way, -that's all I'm saying! At your service, O mighty god. I shall be missing my husband... I shall be missing my husband... Ah ah ah! Daddy, daddy, you've really upset me! Well, if it isn't Cupid! What's he doing here, the little rascal? The little rascal is here to save you. -Save me? -Yes! You're looking for a woman and in order to find her, you don't think of me. Love... What! My little darling, you would do... -There!... Just now I was a rascal, now I'm a little darling... Ah, how ridiculous you are, men and gods, when someone has something over you, for I've got you, daddikins... Yes I know! -Well, you want her, your Eurydice? Yes! Yes, I want her! Leave it to me. I?m going to metamorphose you straight away. Know what I mean? -Metamorphose me into what? You'll see. -I want to know in advance. I want it to be a surprise. A surprise! But the thing is... I need to be something very pretty, you know? You will be very, very pretty... Get ready for the change, papa! Attention! -What's -he going to change me into, the wretch! To draw out of his lair a mouse who is hiding his snout, not far from the little beast's nose one must drop some tasty morsel. I know another method sure to fetch from her hiding-place a woman whom one loves: this method is a sound; but this sweet little noise must be pretty and quite refined! Ah! That's it, the wee beast will react to the sound, the wee beast will react to the sound! That's it, the wee beast will react to the sound, the wee beast will react to the sound! When you want to attract a lark, you shine a mirror in its eyes, and at once you see the vain creature come fluttering to its sparkle! A woman is just the same, you seduce her through her weakness; all she wants is to be loved, and that's how you tell her, but it must be said prettily and in quite a refined way! Ah, that's it, the wee beast will react to the sound, the wee beast will react to the sound! That's it, the wee beast will react to the sound, the wee beast will react to the sound! With a one... a two... and a three! A fly! Elegant, small and slight; like that, you'll get in anywhere! I thought I felt on my shoulder a gentle trembling! I must play my part, not another word! For from this moment I am allowed only to buzz! I am allowed only to buzz! Zz... zz... zz... Ah, what a lovely fly! -zz... Pretty bluebottle! Ah, what a lovely fly! -zz... Pretty bluebottle! -Zz! She's touched by my song, Let's sing my song, let's sing it! -Lovely fly! She's touched by my song, Let?s sing my song! Ah, what a lovely fly! Pretty bluebottle! Beautiful insect with golden wings, will you stay and be my companion? Zz... This place into which you forced your way, alas, for me is a prison. Zz... Do not leave me, I beg you, stay, I?ll take good care of you! Ah! I?ll love you, pretty fly, stay with me, stay with me! I?ll love you, pretty fly, ah! When you want to be adored, you have to make yourself desirable... I?ve got it by its golden wing! -Not yet! Not yet! I?ve got it by its golden wing! -Not yet! Not yet! Oh, you're so naughty, naughty! -I?ve grown wings, my charmer, Oh, you're so naughty, naughty! -I?ve grown wings, my charmer, It just tries to get away from me!... -I?ve every right to make use of them! Out of this light gauze, without smothering it, I can make a butterfly-net. Watch out! Watch out! Ah, I?ve got it! No more resistance! I?ve got it, I?ve got it! The one who's really caught is not the one she thinks! The one who's really caught is not the one she thinks! Sing, sing! -Zz! Sing, sing! -Zz! Zz! -Zz! Zz! -Zz! Ah... Zz, zz, zz, zz... -Zz, zz, zz, zz... Zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz... Zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz... -Zz... Zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz... -Zz... Zz, zz, zz, -Zz, zz, zz, Zz, zz, zz, -Zz, zz, zz, Zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz... Zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz... Zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz... -Zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz... Zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz... -Zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz... Ah, I've got it! Ah, I've got it, I've got it! Ah, I've got it!... I've got it! Ah! Zz, zz, zz... Ah, ah, ah... It's charming! Ah, I was sure, my little winged jewel, that I would catch you! Now you are mine, and for ever; you will be the poor prisoner's consolation! Ah! But look how graceful it is! What lovely colours! What a slim figure! And these golden wings! Come, my little fly! Well, then! All this is yours, if you want it, O adored mortal! Mighty gods! It talks! Help! No, be quiet! See, I?m not a fly, I?ve put on this disguise to trick the bully who jealously guards you and wants to torture you. -Well I never! Who are you then? Me? I hereby declare honesty demands it! that I am your lover, Jupiter Redbeard. -Ah! Yes... it is l, the king of the gods! Before your very eyes! Ah! Yes, I tell you, if I had known, yes, I say, sooner, Pluto would not have carried you off... I?d have taken you up to Olympus. Olympus! You'd take me to see Olympus, you'd get me out of this frightful spot... Oh, let's go, take me away! However, I have to get back to the party that idiot Pluto is giving! It's the only way of not arousing his suspicions... Meet me there! -Eh? Meet me there, there-I?d-say! -Thur-s-day? -No! Meet me presently in disguise, and when everyone's leaving I?ll whisk you away in the crush. What God wants, woman wants! I?m yours, Jupiter!... for ever! In an hour! Oh! I?m a very happy insect! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly! Fly. If I were King of Boeotia... Where is it? The fly? Where's the fly? Ah, John, have you seen the fly? Fly, what fly? ...you would be Queen, I promise you. Eh! Witty, Memento! Remember! Remember? If I were King of Boeotia, you would be Queen, I promise you. Now I can only in semblance He's not a man, he's an organ! -offer you my royal power. The most noble shade, my dear, -The most noble shade, my dear, can only give what it has, -Ah! You are a colleague... so accept, I beg you, in its present form, the heart of a King of Boeotia, the heart of a King of Boeotia! Get out, I don't even want to see you again! Betrayed, betrayed by everyone! I want to take my head and trample it under foot! The fly! Who will bring me the fly! Ah, you want to find that nice multi-coloured insect! Well then, listen, watch, and above all, take note! The fly! The fly! The fly! Long live wine! Long live Pluto! And never mind what they say! Long live wine! Long live Pluto!... And never mind what they say! Company of gods, carried away by this old wine... Let?s praise the god who wears the iron crown!... Let's praise the god who wears the iron crown, the iron crown! His cherished realm shall be our country, his cherished realm shall be our country, if anyone knows how to live, friends, it's those in Hades, it's those in Hades! If anyone knows how to live, friends, it's those in Hades! If anyone knows how to live, friends, it's those in Hades!... Friends! Long live wine! Long live Pluto!... And never mind what they say! Long live wine! Long live Pluto!... And never mind what they say! Long live wine! Long live Pluto! Long live wine! Long live Pluto!... Long live wine! Long live Pluto! Long live wine! Long live Pluto!... Long live wine! Long live Pluto! And never mind what they say! Long live Pluto! Come on, my lovely bacchante, mortal image of Venus! It's me! Sing for us, in your charming voice, sing us your hymn to Bacchus! Sing, sing, lovely bacchante, Sing us your hymn to Bacchus! I have seen the god Bacchus on his fertile rock giving his subjects his joyful lessons, the faun with goat's feet and the complaisant nymph repeated his songs! Repeated his songs! -Repeated his songs! Evoh?! Evoh?! Evoh?! Bacchus inspires me! Evoh?! I feel within me Evoh?! his holy rapture, Evoh?! Bacchus is king! Evoh?! Bacchus is king! Evoh?! Bacchus is king! Evoh?! Bacchus is king! He told them, leave this sad moping, Leave back despairs to undivine mortals, and crown yourselves with vine-leaves and roses, Ah! -which fall from my hands! Which fall from my hands! -Which fall from my hands! Evoh?! Evoh?! Evoh?! Bacchus inspires me! Evoh?! I feel within me Evoh?! -his holy rapture, Evoh?! -Bacchus is king! Evoh?! Bacchus is king! Evoh?! Bacchus is king! Evoh?! Bacchus is king! And here is my little corps de ballet! -Ah! Now, what I want, who am slim and slight, is to dance a minuet, as in the time of the great king. Ah!... Ah!... -Ah!... That ninny Pluto hasn't recognized you; after the dance, we'll run for it! Ah!... -Ah!... That idiot Jupiter thinks I haven't recognized the Bacchante... but I've got my eye on them! -Ah!... Ah!... La la la la la!... The minuet is really never so charming -La la la la la!... as when Jupie dances it. The minuet is really never so charming -La la la la la!... as when Jupie dances it. How flirtatiously he flexes his leg, how rhythmically he moves! The minuet is really never so charming -La la la la la!... as when Jupie dances it. Terpsichore has not more charm in her steps! Terpsichore has not more charm in her steps! Terpsichore has not more charm in her steps! Terpsichore has not more charm in her steps! The minuet is really never so charming -La la la la la!... as when Jupie dances it. The minuet is really never so charming -La la la la la!... as when Jupie dances it, when Jupie dances it. This is an unusual ball; let's all request an infernal gallop! Hurrah for the infernal gallop! Let's all request an infernal gallop! Friends, long live dancing! Long live dancing!... La la la la la!... La la la la la!... La la la la la!... La la la la la!.. La la la la la! Ah! And now, let's run off... -Yes, let's make the most of what breath we have left... Let?s go! Off somewhere? -What do you want? -Do you think, I don't know what has been going on these 2 hours? Do you think in that disguise I didn't recognise the woman? -Whom you didn't carry off... All right, yes, I did carry her off! -What's he saying? -That you behaved towards me as if I were... -Phew! your husband, for the devil's snake! You've made my life Hell in quite the wrong way... He knows everything! -Laugh, go on, laugh! It's a good joke but you're not going to take her up to Paradise! And who would stop me, if I wanted to? -You yourself! -What does he mean? And the husband, who's about to arrive! the dear old husband! -Ah, my husband! I?d completely forgotten about him! -It happens sometimes! -To me, too! The promise you made him, have you forgotten that as well? That it's not to me you'll have to give up Eurydice, but to him! -Clot! What did I promise? Ah! Things are getting tense! I shall raise the tone of the dialogue to suit the situation! From now on I speak only in verse! Take care... Woman, do you recognize that tune on the violin? That tune that he finds broad and I find long, it's the tune of the husband I?ve... -You are right, woman! It is your husband who comes to buy back your soul! That soul which I loved, and love no more! You know, Jupie's orders are absolute! Your husband sues for you, you're restored to earth! What a nice present we're going to make him! -Jupie! Don't worry, I have a plan! And you are not yet on the arm of your bully! Let's have order! Children, behave yourselves! See, their boat has come to the sombre shore... They have no inkling about divine pleasures... And let us take as our watchwords the hexameter and decorum! Yes I?m convinced! And despite her mistakes, she's my wife, and I?m willing to pardon her whims... Ah! Mighty king of... -Stop, that's enough of the smarm! I know what you want: so let's come to the point! Keeping my vow... Keeping my vow, to your wish I accede, with Pluto's assent, I restore her to you. Now go! I?m indebted to Pluto and Jove! -All the same, I?m attaching just one caveat... I will not explain it, I brook no demur. You've no right to know what it's about! To the Styx you must wend you way quite solemnly, with your wife in your wake, without turning around! If, too anxious to look at your spouse, you would dare to dishonour this trifling request, then you'll lose her again, and for ever this time! -But this is foul play! Is there someone against? So now come, in your shadow Eurydice lead; don't turn round! I have spoken! Obey! Do not look back! Fix your gaze five yards ahead! Friend, think of earth, which awaits both of us. What a spot for a husband to be in! Will he look back, or won't he? What a spot for a husband to be in! Will he look back, or won't he? Will I have counted in vain on his curiosity? We triumph! Ah, what joy! Ah, what joy! He's not turning round! Too bad! Too bad! I?ll strike him down. Ah! Miserable man, what have you done? -I didn't mean to! You have lost her, and for ever! So she is mine? No more than she's mine! -How so? No, because I?ve made her into a bacchante. -A bacchante! Ah! ah! ah! ah! Bacchus, my flighty soul, which couldn't be doing with happiness on earth, aspires to you, divine Bacchus! Greet the priestess whose voice will endlessly sing of intoxication to your chosen ones! La la la la la!... La la la la la!... La la la la la!... La la la la la! Cancan! Cancan! Cancan!... This is an unusual ball; let's all request an infernal gallop! Hurrah for the infernal gallop! Let's all request an infernal gallop! Friends, long live dancing! Long live dancing!... La la la la la!... La la la la la!... La la la la la!... La la la la la!... La la la la la!... La la la la la!
