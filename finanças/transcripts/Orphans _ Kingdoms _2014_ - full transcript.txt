We've got to get you to a hospital, bro. What's up bro, what you got in here? Is there a hospital here? Excuse me, is there a hospital on this island? We'll get you to a doctor, I promise. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Jackpot. How about their PINs, ae? You going to give me these PINs? This your kid? He looks gay. Just like you. Three, seven, eight, nine one, two, four, four.

Nah. Uhh, check this out, T. What's going on? - Get him some water. - What? Get him some water. I'm going to cut him loose. Ae? - Don't do that. - Just get him some water. Bro, don't tell me what to do. You cut him, he's going straight to the cops! Get him some water! Go! The fuck. I'm sorry. We just wanted somewhere to stay for a while.

Just get out. Please. Got to get him to a hospital. Then we'll be out of your face but until then you're stuck with us. We need a first aid kit. You stay down here and look after him. Hey. Hey. Just to warn you, if you try anything I'll fuck you up. Huh? OK? Know what I'm talking about? Huh? Oi! You get me? Huh? Eh? What about Jess? He's hurt. My bro needs help. He's hurt and he needs a doctor. We're going to need your help. We're going to need your help. She's asking nice. Please. - Please. - I can't. Oh, he's pissing me off, T. All right. We're going to go, then. I'll keep an eye on Jess. You go and get a blanket. Take him to the car. This was fucked, I know. We shouldn't have broken into your house. Shut up. We just wanted somewhere to lay low for a while. It shouldn't have been like this. Please. Please get out. Ae? You're kidding me. Let's get him on the blanket. Pass it here. Pick his arm up and roll him over. Who the hell do you think you are? You go through my things, my son's things! This is my house! - Let go of him! - My goddamn home! You worthless piece of shit! You let him go! Don't you touch his things. You know what? You're going to clean this mess up. What if we don't? You'll do it for your mate. Wash every glass. Put it all away. All of them. Do you know this is not going to come off? You have as much time as it takes. Jesus. Soap in here, powder in there. Yeah. Use a whole lot. Set the temperature, and you choose a program. Thirty. Normal. Press "Start." All right. Let's deal with your mate. You hurt my bro, I'll hurt you. Do you feel anything? It kind of tingles. Tell me where I'm touching it. At the top. - What about now? - Same. He has to get to a hospital. He'll need a splint. Right. Cut that out. Along the dark lines. What? Along these dark lines, not the dotted. Now, lift his leg and slide it under. Grab that tape. Now wrap the tape around so it holds his leg and his ankle in place. It's going to hurt him, but you have to do it. What's your name? Tibs. Tibs? Is that your real name? Tabitha. Grab some peas out of the freezer. You! What's your name? Bro. Just call me Bro. I'm not your bro. Don't make that mistake. What's your name? Key. Right. Now you can move him. Talk to him for a while. Make sure he's not in shock. What's up, Jess? You're so lame, Key. Nah, he's all right. How's the leg? It's gone numb now, with the ice. - I thought you hated peas. - Mmm. It's broken, ae? Yeah, it's munted, dude. Looks like a zombie took a bite out of it. We'll get you home, bro. No, you won't. We're not going home, Key. Mum fucked up bad this time. Who knows where they'll send us. I wonder how this fella's kid died. Get out. Go to sleep. I'm so sorry about everything. Please don't call the cops. They're all I've got. Christ, if that's all you've got, then god help you. Yeah, it is. Your mates? My brothers... Same mum... You got your wife anyway. You can have more kids. I lost everything when I lost Scotty. Why are you doing this? Jesus Christ. Get up. Where is she? - Better not have touched her. - Shhh. T! Wake up, man! Gotta go! Now just, hold on. - Sit down. - Nae. Where's Jess? Go get him, and bring him through. You guys are going to have some food. Then we'll get him to a doctor. Not you, we'll get him to a doctor. Come on, Key. Ameni. - Ameni. - Amen. Come on. Let's go. I would have preferred a thank you. How'd you guys get to the island? Ferry. Why? Let's go. What's the plan, guys? Where do you live? Well? Where are you going? What are you running from? Give him Mum's number. She'll just have a pipe and come on down. Must be someone. Nah. You're not going anywhere until I know. Please don't start with this shit. What on earth do you expect? You think you can do all this and just walk out of here? Just make it easy for all of us. What the hell am I supposed to do? I shake your hands say, off you go. Keep it simple. Let us go. Go? Where? How? We're off. You sit down and shut up. You're in my house, you do as I say. If you guys aren't going to help me, I'm going to call the police. No, you're not going to call the cops. You tried it on with me and you beat the shit out of him. Go on, look at his bruises. Or did you try it on with him, too, ae? Or what are you doing in a house with three kids, anyway? Pick us up, did you? Brought us home. Everyone knows you're a lonely guy after what happened. You're a lonely guy, ae? - Ae? - You're scared. Whatever. Fuck you guys! I need to get to a hospital. I don't want to be a cripple! Key, go look. Shit! It's the pigs. - Good day Mr Flynn. - Morning. Your alarm went off yesterday. I just thought I'd check if everything's all right. You haven't seen anything unusual? - Anything to report? - No. No sign of forced entry? Anyone on your property, anything like that? No, I don't think so, but... Well, I haven't checked... We've had a bit of a problem with some kids on an adventure. Kids? Some little shits over from the mainland have some fun at our expense. Well, they can't get off without somebody noticing. We'll catch up with them eventually. That's a pretty nasty bruise. Everything all right? Umm... I got a bit carried away last night. You know how it is, party of one. Don't have to drive home, so... well... Umm... I understand. I remember meeting you when I... Look, I'm sorry. It's OK. Umm, I'm fine, really. You'll let us know if you see or... hear anything unusual? Yeah. Of course. Thanks, umm... Mike. And, uhh... don't worry. I won't put it in my notes. You have to get off this island, now. Watch the leg! Belt. No. You guys stay here. Key! Come on. We have to get out of here. Don't touch me. Don't touch me or I'll scream. - I'm serious. - Let go of me! They've got your picture up there. Don't touch me. What's happening now? We'll have to try the car ferry. They'll watch you come in and head down at the last minute. How'd your boy die? He killed himself. Eh! Un-fucking-believable. Check that one out. It's got a Sky dish. We should have broken into one of these. Where will you go? What about your family? You're our family. We're wards of the state. We're everyone's kids. But what about your mother? She didn't even show up at the hearing. At least you've got each other. No. CYF's isn't going to find a place for the three of us... again. They'll just split us up. Just wanted your place to lay low for a few months then I'll be 18. Could have looked after my bro's. You're not my mum, T. You don't look after us. Yeah, 'cause you can really look after yourselves, ae? Yeah, well, I can. I don't need you guys. He's gonna have to, sometime. As soon as this leg's sweet, I'm gone. Go on, then. Fuck off! Leave me and Key. What? You're going to hang around in a foster home and wait for Key? Bullshit. I'm not going back to another foster home! You'll come back, bro. You always fuck up, then come running back to me. I come to you because it makes you happy, T. Fine. You're on your own, then. Oi! Give her a moment. Don't tell me what to do! Got about ten minutes. Stay out of it. Please. Just get in the car. Please. Your brothers are waiting. Just get in the car. - Why are you doing this? - Look, we don't have much time. Please. Let me do this? Guys, there's a cop car coming. Key, where are you going? I'm going to stay here. Back in the car or I'll smash you! What the fuck, Key? I don't want to go back! My old man's here! It's fucking bullshit, Key, and you know it. I'm not going back to another bunch of strangers. Back in the car, he's coming out. OK, you can get up now. Ticket, please. Sure. Two adults, two kids. One car. Family holiday, ae? Yeah. You're going to have to call an ambulance. Please. Where's your brother? Let me go! Let go of me! Let me go! I don't want to go back! I don't want to go back. Scotty! Why did your boy do it? I think he felt like you do now. You hold on to each other. You hear me? They need you. Hey!
