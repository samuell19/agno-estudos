Give us “The Boy I Love”! This theatre, the Old Bedford in Camden Town used to be the favourite theatre of Marie Lloyd, the famous music hall singer. Now, it’s just a mess. For the last few years, it served as a shelter for pigeons, and tramps, and vagrants. It’s not a very good shelter, either, because there’s a bloody great hole in the roof and the rain comes pelting in. Old plaster decoration that used to be up there, pretty masks and the nymphs and shepherds and the fancy scroll work is just a lot of rubble on the floor. When a theatre has served its purpose and there are no longer any people with inclination to come to it, by all means, send for the wreckers, have it knocked down. But the sad thing about this place was that it was dead on its feet for so long, putrefying. Particularly sad because once upon a time, it must have contained such a welter of laughter, and life, and joy. Because on this stage there appeared most of the great music hall artists of the time. And most of the not so great music hall artists. Among whom you may find the name of Belle Elmore, whose ghost may very well still be flapping around backstage because she was the wife and eventual victim of Dr Crippen. Who, somewhere in Camden Town not too far from this theatre, done the poor lady in. There’s another reason for feeling very tender about this theatre and that is, that it was one of the favourite haunts of Walter Sickert. He used to come here night after night with a sketching pad on his knee and sketch away, while Bessie Bellwood and Marie Lloyd would set the cockneys singing. All together now. Camden Town is named after the Earl of Camden whose family owned the estate in the 18th and 19th centuries. The area, although it’s changing, is still recognisable as the world of Sickert. Here, seedy terraces are coming up in the world after years of neglect. Like Rome, London has its catacombs. These, beneath the Camden Freight Terminal, were once used for the movement of dray horses across the yards. The yard is more or less as it was when the railway people used the horses to carry packages and parcels across London. There were about 300 horses and a blacksmith and a saddler had workshops here. Within easy reach of the stables at the railway sheds. Trains passed quite close by, just as they still do today. This is the Roundhouse. A giant turntable for railway engines which was built at a time when engine drivers still wore top hats. Actually, it was partially designed by George Stephenson himself, the Father of the Railway and the inventor of the famous engine, the Rocket. Having once given steam engine its initial shove, he was obliged to apply his creative genius to inventing all the other gadgets that went with railway traffic. All these bits and pieces meant something, once upon a time. They are what you might call the crumbling images of a past but we’d be foolish to mourn them too readily. That was the romantic age of railways. The Age of Steam. And, to my way of thinking, they finally put an end to that with the ritual tearing down of Euston station a couple of years back. But you can still pick up some of the old atmosphere in some of the London termini. For instance, Broad Street has a working model of a Victorian railway engine, which can be activated by a penny in the slot. The street markets still have a certain Victorian boisterousness. They are London’s free entertainers. One of the best of them is here in Church Street, Edgware Road. A nice, quiet street you might say, but you should see it on Saturday morning. Here, give me a plum packet. Have a feel. Here you are, have a feel. Don’t forget to give ’em back. That’s how we got hold of ’em. Now, I said just now that I wouldn’t do it again but I apologise if you paid more. I’ve’ve got to clear stock and let’s be quite truthful, people. We haven’t come down here for the bloody benefit of our health. What can you lose, ladies? It’s a fantastic bargain, it really is. Look, Sheffield-made chutney, one price and one price only. Yours or I’ll clear ’em out the way. Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pale of water, poor old Jill forgot her pill and come down with a daughter. All registered on the day. Over there two and three. Rhubarb, governor! You’ll give me two pound for it, won’t you? No? I’ll make you say yes, I will, I’ll make you say yes. I’m going to charge you 30 shillings, is that all right? It’s got four compartments, four compartments. One of the compartments has got a zip. Always nicks the last of the butter. Now, come and see, to wash it through, wash it in Momo, Oxo, Bisto, Polo, any ‘O’ you like. If you’d like it off of me, there they are. Come and see. If you can make use of them they can cover up all your rude bits when you get out of the bath. But if you’d like them off of me, there they are. There’s a pair in blue for dirty buggers. there’s a pair, they’re in ice blue. Got a pair here in pink. What colour would you choose for a pair? Billy Gramme, help me out, put money in their purses and take the moth balls out. Hallelujah. 15 bob a time. You’ll pay 35 bob in the shop, a pound in … This is Romano House. On the side of Romano’s Restaurant, which in its time must have been one of most swinging. There used to be a tank of goldfish in the window and the story is that one of the Bohemians once relieved himself in the tank, which must have pleased the inhabitants. Which reminds me of another story, of the gold fish a former attendant kept in one of these tanks in the Holborn gents. A fish that went down in the world when the water level dropped. These fish don’t live here, of course, we just popped them in by way of illustration. This public convenience dates back to 1897. It’s one of the few in which the original fittings are preserved. It’s an outstanding survival of Victorian London, it’s quite clear that a Victorian loo is quite a work of art. Here, one might say, one finds the only true democracy because all men are equal in the eyes of a lavatory attendant. This lavatory in Star Yard is also typically Victorian. As are the fine gas lamps in many parts of London. There’s one in Carting Lane, which is quite unique. This is Carting Lane, it’s in The Savoy, a name which is synonymous with Gilbert and Sullivan operas and the D’Oyly Carte Company which performed them. Here’s the lamp. What makes this so special is that it says, “Sewer Ventilating Lamp.” The heat of the lamp at the top draws up the vapours through this … hollow stem. We don’t want to lose this, it’s not only beautiful but unique. As unique, almost, as this gentleman, who is among the last of the old-fashioned lamplighters. Men go and come, but Earth abides. And with it, the river, without which, of course, no great city like London can hope to survive. Just a little way down river of here where London Bridge now stands, in approximately 43 A.D, the Romans managed to flood the River Thames and established what according to all available evidence was a trading centre. Until a few years ago, there was a very real danger that London Bridge might fall down, something to do with the river bed being a bit soft, but they’ve managed to prop it up successfully, I hope. There’s a handy egg Breaking Plant for anyone who might be interested. Somewhere down in that direction the old Clink Prison stood. However, this prison is no longer referred to as ‘Clink’ and it’s only the oldest and most inveterate lag who’d use the expression. “He’s just out of Clink,” you might hear somebody saying. A bit further down the river from here, pirates at low tide were chained hand and foot and left to drown. Some people found it fun to sit and drink and watch them. Not a very agreeable sight. Not too happy about this, either. At one time there must have been an almost perfect view of St Paul’s from here, but you could hardly say so now. The partial destruction of the city of London in the Second World War, offered us a great opportunity to reconstruct in a way that was not only practical, but also aesthetic, but somehow we blew it. But even that doesn’t account for that monstrosity on the left with the green roof. Ick. At any rate, while Sir Christopher Wren was building St. Paul’s, he chose to live in this house here, which offered an unrestricted view of the work in progress. Although it has an 18th century facade, if you go inside you will see that there are parts of it which date back to the 1500s. If Christopher Wren was still the occupant of this house, his address would be Cardinal’s Wharf. And his garden, such as it is, would back on to Cardinal Cap Alley, Southeast one. This man is a street entertainer, a busker. There’s not more than about a dozen of them left in London. They tend to live in furnished rooms near their pitch. And on a good night, this man can earn something like, um … three pounds playing to a cinema and theatre queues. He spent a great deal of his money by adding to his collection of fancy costumes. This chap’s also got an assistant, and they split the takings. It’s not the easiest way to earn a living. Thank you. Jolly good luck, all the best. All the money I get is for those poor girls that fell in Hyde Park while the blackout was on. Well, I used to, uh, years ago, 1935, between 1935 to 1937, I used to be in the music halls where I had a treble act. Uh, my partners have since been killed and I came down to London just after they were killed. Uh, got a job as an insurance clerk, went up to the west end one day and seen some buskers and that’s how I started busking. Um, well, I’m a genius and I felt I was psychologically unfit for normal work. And that’s how I started busking. I’ll allow you the opportunity to stop, watch, look, and listen. Now, you’ll be asking, whose done this before. But I’m going to show you that here, I’ve got the direction. With your assistance I shall see myself. Right now, I’ve never seen it done correct. Have I got any person in this audience? Any man. You’ll have a go? Pick up the chain. There’s a lock there. Chain around the biceps. You know where the biceps are? Take it at the back. Chain it. Tight. Pull it. Are you married? I am. What a pity for your wife. Where do you wanna go now? That’s the idea! Pull it. Come on, let’s see something. You’re like an old woman. It’s hard work. Two and six or a half a crown, ladies or gents. This is Chapel Market, Islington. Morning. Hi. Sorry to have bumped you, sir. That’s all right. When the eating is over and done with, there’s always the undertaker at your service. At least we have a dignified send-off. We get silk and satin, not the spoon and fork. We’re embalmed in cherished memories not jelly and vinegar. I lost my money on the stock exchange in 1929 in England. And then stayed out in San Francisco to 1940 where I decided to come back to England. I always stayed in the Salvation Army because the rent was very reasonable. Only 63 shillings a week for a private room, which they have 60 of them and we got a free breakfast for the 63 shillings. I don’t think you could beat that if you stayed in the Savoy Hotel. May I join you? Yes. Yes. I was just looking at the prices there. Oh yeah. They’re quite stiff, seems to me. Yes. Yes, they are. How much do I have to pay for a bed a night to stay? Six shillings here. Do you get any breakfast? Oh, yes, definitely, yes. What do you get? Well, porridge. Porridge. Egg. Whatever you want. You can either have a porridge, tea and two slices. Or you could have an egg, or tea and two slices. Yeah. Six bob? Yes. Yes. How often do you stay here? Do you stay here all the time? Yes, all the time. I’ve been here couple of years … When did you first come here? What made you first of all, um, decide to come to a Salvation Army hostel? Yes, uh, I lost my wife about seven years ago with cancer and, uh, it was, I couldn’t, uh, I had to get out couldn’t have that room and, uh, that’s how I know, it’s the best place I could get anywhere, the only place I could find. I’d been ‘round to other places, but no use though. I find this place all right, myself. Do you find that living in here is a disadvantage to getting work? I do, very much. You do? Why? Well, because, uh … A lot of people don’t like the address, sir. If you got to employers of labour. Yeah? And you mention this address, I’m afraid you’re bound. But most of them, most that live here, like yourself are people who, um, are down on your luck. Exactly right, exactly. Of course the Salvation Army shelter is only for those who can afford it, the elite you might say. Those who can’t afford it are the ones who sleep rough on a bomb site. The brotherhood of the leaky boot, and the defeated look in the eye, the ones who can’t and won’t communicate with their fellow man. The Salvation Army is clearly more durable than the Yiddish Theatre, because here’s our Yiddish Theatre and what is that surrendered to? Bingo. And bingo, in turn, was surrendered to the wrecker because the enormous modern blocks are on the march and already threatening each last little shop on the corner. And here’s one that looks as if it might be an exception. The Marks family have had a thriving business here for something like a hundred years. And I wouldn’t mind betting it’ll be around for another hundred. Who wants serving? Who wants serving? - Yes, please. - No. Thank you very much. Let me have a jar of gefilte fish, please. Spitalfields in the east end was a long time ago an area for the prosperous. Now, it’s mainly for the poor. Hello. Can I come in for a few minutes? Okay. Thank you. Spitalfields is Jack The Ripper territory. The old people here even remember some of his murders. In this yard, just over there, Jack disposed of victim number two and the poor of the parish clubbed together to buy a nice wreath for her funeral. These streets are exactly the same as they were at that time. Fournier Street. Built by the Huguenots in 1724. These doorways are the originals and have been altered only slightly. They’re among the finest of their kind in London. This shop front in Artillery Lane was built for a silk mercer by a carpenter, Abraham Swan, in the 17th Century. You cheated, you cheated, you big fat liar! For much too long, these children have only had their own doorsteps to play on, but happily, all this seems to be changing. And for the first time, these kids are being given a decent break. For some, however, it’s happened too late. I have been trying here and there, to see … to see whether I could, uh … better myself in a better way, you see. I have been trying. Mostly trying. It’s difficult. But, I’ve been trying very hard and different ways, to see if I can … to see if I can become something of myself … in time. The same thing will soon be happening to most of the buildings we’ve been looking at. They’re out of date, inefficient, taking up too much space. But there’s no need to be too sad about it because, after all, most of Victorian London was fairly hideous. And we can also console ourselves with the knowledge that the same fate attends our least favourite modern monstrosities. Man is fighting man, brother is fighting brother, nation is fighting nation, the world is in a turmoil. Satan is not king. The book has told you that what God will do when he comes on this earth, he will banish Satan forever and you will see who is the ruler of this universe. I have told you once again, be careful, be warned, the time is now.
