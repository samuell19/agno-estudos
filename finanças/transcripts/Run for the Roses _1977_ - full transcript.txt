You'll be sorry. - [Boy] He's gonna be a dummy. (soft classical music) - Here boy, come here. Got something for you. Come here. There you go. Come here, boy. Yeah. Come on. Yeah, that a boy. Come here. Sure would like to ride you a little. Now I'm a jockey. Well not exactly a jockey yet but I will be. Hey boy, come on. Good huh? You know, all horses like sugars. Except my friend, Flash, told me he once knew a horse who wouldn't even touch it and they called him Sugar. I wonder what your name is. I want to be a jockey. That's gonna be good. Alright. You know, I haven't really learned how to ride fast yet. So we got to take it easy. Its coming, whoa. Whoa. (grunting) hey hold it. Whoa. - [Man] Damn it what the hell you think you doing? Hey boy, stop that horse. - [Juanito] Hey, slow down. - [Man] Whoa, pull on the reigns, pull on the reigns. Whoa! You alright, boy? - Yeah, got me real good, sir. - You okay? - Yeah, thanks a lot - I'm gonna mix you up the corn and feed you to the hawks, boy. You ought to know better than fooling around with a horse like that. You know how much that Thoroughbred's worth? Half a million dollars and you're out there joy riding it, having a good time. What if he would of hurt himself? You got a half a million dollars, boy? - No. - I didn't think so. You get out of here and don't come back. - Look, mister, I won't even look at your horses anymore. - Well if I tell your father, I know you won't be. Now you just get out of here. (soft classical music) (doorbell rings) - Good afternoon, sir. - Hello, Mitchell. - The mistress is expecting you. - I'll be waiting for her in the study. - Yes. You know you Kentuckians get about as fired up over a horse race as we Californians do over the Rose Bowl. - That's right. - Pardon me, madam. Mr. Eaton is here in the study. - Oh thank you, Mitchell. Would you please get my secretary and my nephew? I'm sorry, gentlemen. I have to leave you for a minutes. Please, Jeff, take care of them. - Alright. - Since you're the trainer of Mrs. Stewart's horses, how do you feel about Battle Cry? - I'm sorry to impose you in this way, Rodger. This shouldn't take long then we can go back to the party. Oh, Jim, Carol would you please come here for a moment? - Jim, Clarissa would like to buy your share of the farm. - Rodger, my dad gave me that farm and I'm really not interested in selling it. - Well I have prepared some papers. Would you like to read them over? - I believe I said I don't want to sell. - You have the place mortgaged to the Hills and you have no money. - What I do with my land and my life is my business, not yours. - What you do with our family's land is my business. You don't want to sell it to me I can have George at the bank foreclose and I'll buy it from them. - You don't really give me much choice, do you? Alright, you've got it. Let me say that I'll be glad to get out from underneath your thumb. - Well, I've never known you to be a quitter. - Well I think its about time that somebody quit. Everybody around here always does what Clarissa says. Well not me. - Somebody has to be in charge. It happens to be me. If you can handle that, you're welcome to stay. If you can't. - You know if I stayed here I would be an errand boy for you for the rest of my life and that's something I just can't live with. Wait a minute. I agreed to sell my broodmare and my share of the farm but I didn't say anything about the old mansion. - But its crumbling. I could have it restored. - Let it rot. That's one place you can't take away from me. - What about the one acre with the cottage? - Rodger, I don't want to sell that place either. Charlie and his family live there. - Charlie is my manager. I'd like to keep that as part of my farm. - I'm giving that house to Charlie. I think I owe him at least that much and I think you know why. Thank you, Rodger. - Carol, I'll need your signature as a witness on this. - Hi, Flash, where you headed? - Over to Charlies. - Well come on, get in. - Hey thanks man, thanks. Say Jim, saw that mare of yours. Looks like she's about ready to throw that foal. - She's not my mare anymore, Flash. I sold her. - Oops. Hey, hey. You made me sit on my dice, man. Look here, me and my cousin was playing craps over at uh... - Bob's place? - Yeah, Bob's place. Man he would make a clean sweep. Gonna have enough money now to bet on the Derby tomorrow. - I thought you told me you hated horses, Flash? - Oh I hates em but bets em. - Who you betting on? - Battle Cry, on the nose, baby. Charge! Alright. - Flash. - Hey. - Just in time for dinner. - That's just what I was figuring. - Well hello, Jim. - How you doing, Charlie? - Come on in. Party over so soon? - Not soon enough. (speaking Spanish) Hi, Lola. - Sit down, Jim. - Not really very hungry. - Oh just a little bit of a nibble. - What you doing, Flash? - Permeating my nostrils with the smell of that good rabbit stew. - Okay, you sit at the table. - Gracias. - Want some wine? - Fine. - What's the trouble, Jim? - I'm getting out of town, Charlie. - Yeah I figured that would happen sooner or later. (speaking Spanish. - Right on. Hey wait a minute, what she mean by that? - She wants to fatten you up. - Oh well that suits me fine. - Where's Juanito? Is he eating. - He's out back, working off some punishment. - Punishment for what? - He stayed away from school again, today. - Twice this week. - Charlies a little too rough on the boy. - Ah what do you mean rough? - Boy, what a rat. He had to tell Charlie. Charlie could sure yell a lot when he's mad. For a minute there, I'd thought he'd make me stay home from the derby tomorrow. Boy was he mad. Who does he think I am anyway? A slave? He gets to eat dinner while I have to chop the dumb wood. Bet that's why they keep me around here. I'm a good slave. (phone ringing) - I'll get it. - More, Flash? - Look here, if I didn't like it, I'd say no. - So you say yes? - I say yes yes yes. - I'll be right there. Clarissa wants to see me in private. - Charlie? - I got to hop to it. You stay, Jim. - No, I really have to be going. I have some packing I have to do. I just stopped by to give you this. - What's that for? - I want to settle my debts. The deed to the house. (speaking Spanish) - Jim, I don't know what to say. - Then don't say anything, Charlie. You better hop to it. Don't want to keep Clarissa waiting. - Wait a minute, now wait a minute. We've got to have a toast. Alright, to Charlie and you're good fortune and to Jim, the man of the hour and to Battle Cry. I hope you don't take no shower. To Battle Cry. - Gold stinks. Everything around here stinks. I'll run away. Then they'll be sorry. They'll miss me but who cares. I won't miss them. (soft classical music) - Hi, Juanito. Well you may not be tired but I sure am. Come on in and sit down. - I'm running away from home. - Me, too. - Want to take me with you? - I sure wish I could, Juanito but you know Charlie and your mother would be awfully mad at me if I did. They love you and they miss you. - Mom would but Charlie, he don't miss nobody. All the time he tells me what to do. - You know something, I think you have Charlie all wrong. You want to know what kind of man Charlie really is? When I was about your age, my cousin and I... - Cousin? How come I've never seen him around. - Because he's dead, Juanito. He was Clarissa's son. He and I were about the same age and we played together all the time. He was about the only playmate I had. One day, he and I were pretending that we were jockeys. - Just like I want to be when I grow up. - Yeah, just like that. Why we snuck out to the paddock, we climbed on the back of one of Clarissa's thoroughbreds. Now as you know, a thoroughbred is a very temperamental horse and only the very best jockeys can ride them. Well that horse bolted. We hung on for dear life. That horse ran and ran and ran. (horse neighing) (tense trumpet music) (tense classical music) Charlie pulled us both out of the water. My cousin hit his head on a rock and he died but I made it. So you see, I owe Charlie my life. He's a hero he's only trying to do what he thinks is best for you. - Well why do I have to go school then? - You have to go to school to learn what to do when you grow up. - I know what to do when I grow up. I'm gonna become a jockey and have my own horse and everything. Call him Champion. - One day, if you go back to school and you study real real hard, the good lord will send you a horse. - Is that for sure? - That's for sure. I was just saying goodbye to Juanito, Charlie. - I'm heading back home. Want to come along, son? - Like Jim said, father. Just saying goodbye to each other. See ya, Jim. - So long, partner. - I'll see you later, Jim. - Charlie? Hey Charlie? - Yeah? - Charlie. Zemaya, she's rolling and kicking all over the barn. - Come on, let's go. - Okay. - Is she gonna foal? - Look, that's about what it is. Now I've been everything else but charlie, I ain’t never been no vet. - I'm going, too. Hey wait for me. - [Woman] Juanito. (speaking Spanish) - Come on, come on. Go. - Thank you for dinner, Clarissa. - You're welcome, Jeff. - Sleep well. - Yes I will. - Goodnight, Jeff. - Jeff. - What? - Ms. Clarissa, wait. - What is it? - Its Zemaya, she's foaling. Well, Charlie sent me over because the phone in the barn is dead and he ain’t no vet and he don't think he can handle it. - I'll call doctor. - Carol, get the car. I want you to drive me to the barn. I'll get the coats. (neighs) - That's it, baby. Come on. (neighing) yeah. Nice and easy now. Just give it a little bit more. (grunts) Come on. Oh that's a beauty, honey. Oh yeah. Huh? Yeah. Okay. (soft classical music) - Hi, Charlie. - Hi, Doc. - Charlie, it looks like you've done everything right. - It was easy. It wasn't my first. (neighs) - What is it? - Its a colt. - Good. Everything alright? - Not exactly, Clarissa. Charlie did a fine job foaling the mare. Colt has a broken leg and has (mumbles) of the knee. - Oh god. - Well can it be corrected by surgery? - Sure it can. Depends on how the operation turns out whether you have a stallion or a racehorse. - I don't need a stallion, I need a derby winner. - But Clarissa, there is a chance... - A lame colt is a useless colt, Carol. - He's not useless, he's beautiful. - You want him? You can have him? - Me? (speaking Spanish) Yes? - Yes, for you. - Clarissa, you can't give him away. - Of course I can. He's all yours, Juanito. Come on Carol, drive me home. (speaking Spanish) - Charlie, my own horse. Look. I'll name you champion. Royal Champion. - He'll be lame. You heard what the doc said. - I don't care, I love him. I'm so happy, Charlie, I'm so happy. It's my own horse. - He's yours he's yours. Oh yeah. - Flash, Flash! - Oh Juanito, my head, man. - Come on, man. (mumbles) we'll be late. - Will you cool man? Just play it cool. The way you acting today, you ain’t gonna need no car to take you to no derby, you could fly over there. - Come on, Charlie already left and the traffic's piling up. We're gonna be the last ones there, man. Hey, Flash? - Uh huh? - I got two silver dollars from my aunt Rosa for my birthday. - Good for you. - And I know they don't let kids bet could you bet for me? - Now just a minute. What makes you think that I'm gonna put my money on this horse race? Okay I'm gonna put my money on the horse race. (laughing) okay, of course I'll make a little gentlemen bet for you and me. Horse named Battle Cry comes in, we'll be in fat city. - Alright. - Come on, let's go, partner. (upbeat fanfare) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the horses are in the paddock now being saddled for the seventh race for derby and they will reach the gate in about 16 minutes. (upbeat fanfare) - I don't know, Flash. How are we gonna get to see Battle Cry? - Easy man, easy all we got to do is act like we somebody that way they don't have to ask us no questions, we don't have to give them no answers. Come on. - Alright. (whistling) - Sorry, owners and trainers only allowed beyond this point. - I just wanted to see my friends horse, sir. - You can see the horses from your seats in the stands just like anybody else. - Now, just one minute, officer. The little boy didn't mean any harm. - Owners and trainers only. - Come on. (upbeat fanfare) - [Announcer] Looks ready to us. But this is a contest of speed not beauty. The odds of changing on number two Dark Prince pioneer horse, was put at seven to one this morning, the odds have now dropped to 20 to one. Dark Prince's trainer, Bart Shaker, knows his horse is up against very very tough competition. Lucky number seven, Bright Victory, is a Massachusetts horse that's been wintering in Florida. He's handled by the experienced Harry Barter. A trainer who's brought 15 thoroughbreds to the derby in his great career. Marcus' Bright Victory will run for that blanket of rope today. - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the next race brewing the derby may we urge that you make your wagers as early as possible. - [Announcer] King of thoroughbred racing it is this year. Besides the top two, we're also going to be watching out for number eight today, Wolfish Coal from Carter Farms. A name that's been favorite as long as there's been a derby. - [Announcer] Repeating, in the seventh race there are no changes. (upbeat fanfare) Third generation trainer who brings only the best to run the derby. That's what we have here today, the best. All running with everything they've got at speeds up to 40 miles an hour. We know how nervous the owners are now. - One for you, four for me. (laughing) Battle Cry! - [Announcer] The riders in today's race are the top men in their profession. Some of them have won the derby before. Some will keep on trying. Because to win the roses is to win the... - [Announcer] The horses are coming on the track for the derby. At one mile and one quarter on the main track. - [Announcer] Favorite Battle Cry from the well Stewart ranch looks ready to us. - [Announcer] Number one is Tinkerbell. Number two, Dark Prince. Number three, Momma's Girl. Number four, Rocket Square. Number five, Easy Rider. Number six, Thunder Echo. Number seven... - Is everything alright? - It's out of our hands. Its all up to Battle Cry now. - [Announcer] Number nine, Amber Waves. Number 10, Clara's Bell and number 11, Battle Cry. They will reach the starting gate. - I can see him, I can see him, look. He's over there. (upbeat fanfare) - [Announcer] The favorite, Battle Cry from the well known Stewart Ranch looks ready to us but this is a contest of speed not beauty. The odds are changing on number two, Dark Prince, a fine young horse that was seven to one, the odds have now dropped to 20 to one. Dark Prince's trainer, Bart Shaker knows his horse is up against very very tough competition. The riders in today's race are the top men in their profession. Some of them have won the derby before. Some will keep on... - [Announcer] The horses are on the track now for the derby. (upbeat fanfare) - [Announcer] The post positions for the one and one quarter mile derby. - [Announcer] They are entering the starter date. - You know, if I win I'm taking everybody to dinner. - Alright. - Even me, right? - Yeah. - [Announcer] The flag is up and there they go. Momma's girl is going to the front. Thunder Echo is second, Easy Rider is third and Rocket Square, Bright Victory and Battle Cry. Around the first turn, it's Momma's girl in front by and half. Thunder Echo is second by one lane. Easy Rider in third. Rocket Square in fourth. Bright Victory, Battle Cry and Wolfish Call down the back stretch. It's Momma's girl in front, Battle Cry in second and now taking the lead on the outside. Now its Battle Cry in front by a length and a half. Momma's Girl is second by a half, Dark Prince third on the rail. Rocket's Girl is fourth and Wolfish Call is closing much ground. Turning for home, its Battle Cry in front by a leg. Momma's Girl is second by a half lane. Dark Prince third on the inside. And here comes Wolfish Call in the middle of the tracks. In the stretch and Battle Cry flies by one lane. (crowd shouting) (overlapping uproar) By a neck. Battle Cry in second with Dark Prince finishing third. - Bad luck. - He was right in there, Clarissa. - I can't believe it. - Believe it. It happens every year. - [Announcer] The result, number eight, Wolfish Call was first, number 11 Battle Cry. - That's alright, my boy. - I'm bankrupt, man. - There's always another year, Flash. - Never never again. I hate horses, I tell you. I hate them. - I know it hurts, Champion but you just have to keep trying. All the days we've been out here working on your leg to make it stronger. All the time we've put in and all the pain you felt before. That's all down the drain if you stop trying. I won't let you give up. We're gonna walk nice and slow everyday, okay? - Say, Juanito. I'm going to your house for dinner, man. You coming? - No, I want to work with Champion a little more. - Juanito, you've got to eat. I mean you've been out here all afternoon. Now son, how you gonna grow up if you don't eat? - I don't have to grow. I'm gonna be a jockey, remember? - Uh huh, you told me you was gonna be a vet instead. - So? I'll be a short vet. - Okay, okay I'm going up to the house but you make sure you come home soon else you're gonna make your momma mad. - Okay. (soft country classical music) - You know, my mother told me I didn't start walking till I was one. - Juanito still hasn't given up on that colt. He should be put away. - Well I would but its the only way I can keep Juanito in school and up on his studies. No grades, no horse. - You walk awful slow, Juanito. Maybe you could move a little faster if you had a horse. - I have my own horse, Rusty. You don't know anything. - I know a lame horse when I see one. What's his name? Gimpy? - No, his name is Royal Champion. He's gonna be a racer when he's old enough. - You haven't got any racing horse. All you have is a no good lame, gimpy colt. Can't even ride your dumb horse. - I can, too. - Like this? - You know, Flash. There are operations they can do on a horse born with a crooked knee so he can run faster. - Oh yeah, sure sure. Now there are operations they can do on my nose and I'll come out looking just like Donny Osmond. Oh, Juanito, I'm trying to say an operations a different thing. - I know but the operation works then Champion wouldn't have to limp anymore. - Yeah, maybe they got to put him down. - No way, Flash. Nobody's gonna kill my horse. - Look, Juanito, look here. You see my leg here? My leg holds me up the same way Champion's legs holds him up and my leg ain’t much fatter. One big difference, just one, he must weigh, he must weigh 10 times as much. Now if Champion is not strong enough when he puts that 1,000 pounds of pressure on it, man it just ain’t gonna break, you gonna hear me? It is gonna explode into a million pieces and may never heal back together again. That could kill him. - Oh. I don't know, Flash. I never had to think about something this important before. If the operation would work, maybe. - Maybe, maybe not. Look here, son. Champion's your horse, right? Now if you want him to have an operation, Charlie will talk to the doc. - Yeah. I'll think about it. - Here. (whistling) - I made it, Champion. Yeah, they were watching TV. I don't think they heard me. You know, why would I want to sleep in my room all by myself? When I can be here with you. I don't want you to get lonesome. Yeah, you'll get used to sleeping alone. Yeah. Okay, goodnight, Champ. - How's that fast racing horse of yours? - He's okay. - Is he gonna be in the Kentucky Derby this year? - No, he's too young. - You hear that? Juanito's lame horse isn't gonna be in the derby because he's too young. Your horse can't even run. - Why don't you shut up, Russel. - Why don't you make me? (grunting) - Oh my god. - Juanito, get him. Get him good. - Stop it, you're gonna hurt him. (grunting) - Your horse is still a cripple. You hear me? He's a cripple. A cripple! - Look, does an operation cost a lot of money? - Yeah, an operation costs a wheelbarrow full of money. - Well if I work everyday after school for about, say five years, I'd probably have enough saved by then. Or not, plus Champion will be too old to race. - Alright, now wait a minute. I asked the doc about it and the doc said that we could owe him for the cost of the operation. - Alright! (laughing) - Now, if Champion runs and wins some races and a lot of money, then we can get the docs on. Now, all he needs is just a couple hundred to start and he'll do the operation. - Work five afternoons, boy. So here's you pay. - Thanks, see you Monday. (people shouting) (cheering) - Alright, I'll cover that. (overlapping shouting) - Here we go. 10. This hand. Come on. 11. Do it, got my money. Somebody, you want that? Yeah, that's yours. (overlapping shouting) Okay I get five more. Alright, five more. (overlapping shouting) Alright. (cheering) I got it, I need it. (laughing) - Did you win a lot, Flash? - Oh my man, enough, just enough. But you see right here represents one fine operation for one fine horse! - Alright. You mean it? - Mean it? Yeah I mean it. What with you got, and what I got, we kick it in, baby we gonna go over the top. - Alright. Yeah. (humming race fanfare) (soft instrumental music) Champion. Tomorrows the operation but you don't have to worry, doc is really good at doing em. He does them all the time. You know I bet he could operate on your leg with one hand tied behind his back. You don't have to worry, I'll be there with you. See, Champion, you were born to be a racer. Your daddy came in second in the derby and your granddaddy was just as fast. Your momma was a winner, too. You see, Champion, its in your blood. Once you start running, you'll show them all. I know you have a lot of important things to do but Champion's only one little horse. Shouldn't be hard for you. Enough to run like the other horses. Please help Champion get better. Thank you. - Charlie, this is the part of the knee we're gonna have to operate on. In order to straighten the crooked leg. We'll put a staple right in here. After the operation, the knee should look like this with the staple in it. Within about 30 or 40 days, we ought to be able to take the staple out and I hope we have a straight leg. (soft instrumental music) - About down there. Easy, boy. Easy, easy. (soft somber music) - There he goes. (low tense music) (soft instrumental music) Scalpel. Suture. Sponge. (low instrumental music) Very shortly, he'll be running faster than you. - Gracias, mister vet, gracias for fixing my horse. - Certainly. (uplifting classical music) - Well, limpy ain’t limping no more. - Yeah, he's turning out to be a fine healer. - If I take him, win all the races in the whole wide world. - Maybe, maybe. Now I likes him, but I still hates horses. - Come on, Champion, let me see you go, come on. (horse neighs) (soft uplifting classical music) (soft uplifting classical music) - You've got to make a decision. - I'm not ready to make a decision. - Why? - Jeff, please don't argue. - But Happy Dancer's in excellent condition. You've got to nominate him for the derby. - I have other ideas. - Would you mind letting your trainer in on your ideas? - I want Champion back. - What? - I never should of given him away in the first place. - But you did. - That's right. Legally the horse belongs to the boy. - I know that but there are ways around it. You talk to Charlie. Make him an offer. - How much? 20, 30,000? - Whatever it takes. I want that horse back. Now if you'll excuse me, Jeff, you take over here. Carol. - Excuse me, I have to go. - She'll never change. - I'm sorry, Jeff. I won't sell the horse. - Think of the boys education, think of yourself. Its a lot of money. - Its not the money, its the boy. I can't take the horse away from the boy. Thanks a lot for the offer. - Goodnight, Charlie. - I'll see you later. - Juanito. - Go away. - The man is gone. - You sold my horse to him, you sold Champion. - No, no. You're wrong about that. That's the third time I've sent that man away. Champion is your horse and yours to keep. - Really? - Really. - You mean, you didn't sell him? - No, I didn't sell him. - Oh Charlie, I love you, I love you, Charlie. - Okay now, okay. Okay, Juan. No you go to sleep, huh? - Okay. (speaks Spanish) Charlie. (speaks Spanish) (soft classical music) - You are a good father to my son. I am grateful. - Our son, Norma. That horse certainly has made a difference in that boys life. - Gracias. - Oh come on, Flash. Let him loose. Charlie said I could ride him. - You ain’t no jockey yet, now this the way you gonna learn. Nice and easy. - So Jeff came back to you with another offer, huh? - A big hunk of money but I couldn't take it. Ever since Juanito got that horse, its been like Christmas for him. He's the happiest little fella in the whole wide world. - I see what you mean. (horn honks) - Hey, look. Its Jim. - Charlie, how you doing you old buzzard, it's good to see you. - You son of a gun, this is a surprise. - Jim. - Hey, how you doing? - Why didn't you tell us you were coming? I missed you. - Jim, Jim. - Juanito (speaks Spanish) - Hey, Jim. - Hey, Flash. Good to see you. - You, too man. - Good to see you. - Look at my horse, Jim. It's my own horse. - Wow, he's a beauty. What's his name? - Champion, remember I told you I was gonna name my horse Champion? - Oh yeah. - Royal Champion. - That's a great name. Royal Champion. - Clarissa gave it to him. - Did she really? - That's not all. - Well what else did that sweet lady do? - She's restoring the old mansion. - That's right, Jim. - Well I'll be darned. That lady has finally put one over on herself. - What's that supposed to mean? - I'll see you all later, alright. Is she at the house, do you know, Carol? - Well come to mention it, she had to go down to the old mansion to see the architect this morning. - Where you going? - I'm going to see my aunt. I got a little surprise for her. - I've got the funny feeling there's gonna be a couple people in for a surprise. - Now, the important thing is that it be restored exactly the way it looked in the 1800s. Now you notice those porticoes there, they've obviously got a facade of brick on them. They were originally wooden, round porticoes. So, first of all the brick, oh Jim, hello, what brings you home? - Oh I just heard about what was going on over here, thought I'd come by and see for myself. - Good, you're not angry? - Why should I be angry? I just couldn't wait to see your face when I told you the latest news. - Oh what? - You're in for a big disappointment, Clarissa. - Why? - Cause I don't own this place anymore, I sold it. - I know. - You know? - Well you sold it to, Mr. Stone, didn't you? - How'd you know that? - Mr. Stone was acting as my agent, he bought it for me. The brick on the portico has to come off because they were originally wooden columns. The windows have been cut into larger sizes... - I don't have anything more to say to you ever. - Well, I don't think she's really like that, Jim. I think she's just frustrated and for some reason or other she takes it out on you. - Carol, she's angry at me for being alive. I'm alive and her son is dead, its as simple as that. - Oh you think that's it? - Yes I do think that's it. It makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? It doesn't make it any easier to handle. Isn't that a gorgeous view? - Oh its beautiful. - Why don't we sit down. - You know what? You still haven't told me why you came back. - I came back to go to the auction tomorrow. I'm gonna take the money I got from selling the old mansion and buy myself a yearling. I read that (mumbles) Farms is putting up a brother to Bolder Warrior, he's the best of the lot and I'm gonna get it. - I thought you didn't like the horse business? - Carol, what difference can that make? Clarissa can buy and sell horses and make a profit, so can I. Maybe I can do a better job. - Is that the only reason you came back? - No, that's not the only reason I came back. If I can get a horse and get myself a stake it would be better for us. - Us? - Yeah, us. I couldn't ask you to marry one of Clarissa's errand boys, could I? Or anybody else's errand boy. - You sure have a funny way of proposing. - Nobody's perfect. - I love you. - Hey, what's happening little partner? What's this? Not bad, not bad. What is it? - Special food for Champion. Got the recipe from one of my horse books. Its supposed to make Champion strong and healthy. - I wonder what its gonna do for me. - Hey, Flash you got any orange juice? - Yeah right there in the freezer, little man. - Hey, guess what? Good news. There's going to be a wedding around here. - Alright, don't tell me. Jim and Carol, right? (mumbling) No, I knew it. - Look, everything's not set yet, alright? Plus, Jim's gonna go to the auction tomorrow, right and he wants to buy himself a horse so he can race it and then bred his own stable so he'll have enough money so he can get married. - Why would Jim need any money to get married? - Well where's he gonna live with Carol? Who's gonna pay the rent? Who's gonna put food on their table? You? - Jim's aunt, Clarissa, has all the money in the world. Maybe she could give him some. Maybe even give him a thoroughbred. - Now look, you and I both know that Jim and his aunt Clarissa don't get along so good at all and Jim's like you, he wants to do his own thing, you know what I mean? Jim be madder than centipede with sore feet if he aunt messes in his business. - Yeah, all his aunt Clarissa has to say is that chair is white, he'll go no it ain’t, its black. - Now wait a minute, come over here. Have a seat. Let me ask you something, did you ever hear the story about what happened to Clarissa's son when he just a little boy? - Yeah, Jim told me. - Alright. Now think bout this, maybe the reason she's always telling Jim what to do is because she wants nothing bad to happen to him? Cause Jim's all she got left in the world. - Hey Flash, do you think Champion's leg is good enough to race yet? - Champion. I done seen a lot of horses in my day and I swear to god, Champion must be one of the fastest and strongest I've ever seen. - Alright, so the minute school's out, start racing him all over the place. Probably by then, we'll have enough money to pay off the doc. - Slow down, big shot. Please slow down. Now just because the horse won a race don't mean he gonna win some money. - 20, 30. (auctioneer rapid rambling) Here we go. Sold, 75,000. - Here he is, hip number 100. A dark bare brown colt from consignment from Maplerun Farm by Majestic Prince, Ala save time by War Admiral. Majestic Prince, a classic winner of over 414,000 dollars and state winners Majestic Light, Champion Moss Major Red, (mumbling) and others. From the family of leading sire Bull Lead. A nice colt from Majestic Prince. - Alright, here we go. What's your pleasure? (rapid rambling) 40,000. 50. 50,000. I have 50,000. Now 70. 70, that will be 100. - 100. - 100. (rapid rambling) - That's Jim bidding, he told me he wants... (shushes) (rapid rambling) - 15, thank you now, 16. - 200. - I get 200. - Didn't you hear me, you're bidding against Jim. - I heard you and I know what I'm doing. (rapid rambling) - Where are you. (rapid rambling) Sold to Mrs. Clarissa Stewart, 200,000. Thank you. - Why did you do that? - We'll discuss it later. Thank you. - Thank you, ma'am. - You deliberately took that horse away from Jim. - Carol, lower your voice. - I will not lower my voice. I believed you. I honestly thought you were trying to help Jim. I was wrong. He needed that horse desperately to get a new start and you couldn't resist another chance to dominate him. - Listen, young lady. I want Jim back in this business just as much as you do. Only with me on my farm which is going to be his one day. Till then, he can do it my way or no way at all. - You seem to think your ways the only way. Well I'm not gonna sit by and watch you destroy him. He's too good to be your errand boy. I quit. Get yourself another secretary. (sighs) - You're in a big hurry. What's the matter? - You in there? - No, I just got here. - Did it again, Charlie. She took that horse away from me. - Well now if its a horse you want. - Don't talk to me about horses! Get in, I'm gonna get plastered. - I'll drink to that. Champion is a good horse, maybe even a great one. You know, instead of laying out money to buy a new horse with, you can use it to pay for board, training and track fees. - How's his leg? - Oh as good as new, believe me. We could form some sort of a partnership. Half the winnings go to you and to the other half go to Juanito. - Forget it, Charlie. - Alright. Have it your own way. It might interest you to know that your aunt wants to buy him back. - She does, huh? - Yes she does. She knows a good horse when she sees one. - Well that's one horse she ain’t gonna get. - It's a deal then, huh? - You bet. - And I know just the jockey. - Who's that? - The best. (upbeat country music) there he is. How you doing, Eddie? - Hey, sit down pal, let me buy you a drink. - This bum? You got to be kidding me. - Who you calling a bum? - Ah sit down, kid. I don't want to get hurt. - Come on, Eddie, you're coming with us. - Where you taking me? - We're gonna put you back in the saddle again. - Oh no, wait. - Come on. - Now wait a minute. - Come on. - Now wait a minute. (tense fanfare) - Come on you're doing it. Move, come on. (cheering) - One 57, two. - Alright. - yeah. - Oh my god, look who's here. - Charlie, I'd like a word with you. - Uh oh. - Jim, he is really swift. I mean man, if I turn him loose, he will eat that track alive. - Did he stay on the bit good, Eddie? - Oh he was pulling me through the saddle. - Ah terrific. - You suppose I could have one little drink now? - Yes sir, some special service. How about a good stiff shoot of Pepsi? - You guys are all heart. (laughing) - So this is what you've been doing behind my back. - Well Jim is working out Juanito's horse. I don't see any problem on coming out here to watch. - It looks very much like a conspiracy to me. You're fired. - Just a minute now. - That's it, pick up your check. - Flash. - Me? - Yes, you. - She must be really hot. That's the first time she's every called him Flash. - I've never seen her this way. - What was that all about? - Imagine, after all these years, she fired Charlie. - Fired Charlie? - Yeah. - What she want with you? - Oh she fired me, too. - Well that's alright. We're hitting the road, aren't we? - Right on. - From now, its Champion racing all around the country. - Yay! - Charge! - Charge! (horse racing trumpet fanfare) (horse neighs) (bell rings) (upbeat fanfare) (soft classical music) (cheering) - Yeah, alright. Yeah we won, we won. Alright. - I loves horses. (cheering) Yeah! - Would you like some brandy, Rodger? - No thank you. - Jeff? - I'd like some, thanks. - Mitchell. - Madam, there's a long distance call for you. - Oh thank you. Would you bring the brandy please? - Hello, Ms. Clarissa. Hey, this is Flash. - Oh yes. - Look, I realize that we no longer have a professional association since you canned me and Charlie but I thought I might call you and tell you how well Champion's doing. Yes ma'am, Jim is doing fine but he only got two legs, he ain’t the one winning races. I thought I would ask you that when we come back to Kentucky, well you would tell Jim what a great great job that he did all by himself if you get the drift of my meaning. - Yes. Thank you. Call me from (mumbles). Thank you. Well, gentlemen, Champion just won the Arlington Park Handicap. - Fantastic. - Marvelous. - He's won six out of his last eight starts and placed in the other two. I'll never forgive myself for giving him away. ♪ Oh the sunshine shine ♪ ♪ Bright in my old Kentucky home ♪ ♪ The corn stalks bright ♪ ♪ And the meadows in the moon ♪ ♪ While the birds make music ♪ ♪ All day ♪ (soft tense music) - Alright, Charlie now what about the facilities there? Hold on a minute. Come on, in. Listen, when you get through at Hollywood Park, you may have to fly up to San Francisco to check up bay. Hold on. - Have you seen, Juanito? - He's asleep in your room, isn't he? Yeah we found a barn right across the street from the motel. (tense dramatic music) Why don't you check the barn? This will make the third night Juanito's slept with that horse. - You know kids and animals. I'll go take a look. - Yeah we think Juanito's sleeping with the horse. Yeah. Alright now any other problems. (tense dramatic music) - Jim, Jim! Get out here. Come on, quick! (tense dramatic music) Juanito, wake up, you got to get out of there. - Oh my god! Juanito! Are you in there? - Juanito, where are you? (tense dramatic music) - Juanito! - Champion, Champion, are you alright? Champion run, run as fast as you can! (tense dramatic music) - Horses got out the back. - Juanito, where are you? Look out! Juanito. (tense dramatic music) Juanito! - I need a hand here. Give me a boost up, Jim. - Jim, Eddie, up here. - Juanito come. Jump, Juanito. Come on now, you can do it. - Come on. - Come on. - We got you. - Yeah we got you. Are you alright? Are you burned? Okay. You go check on Royal Champion. If you ever sleep in that barn again I'll break your neck, you hear that?

(laughing) (upbeat dance music) oh there's one right there. - Alright. - Now first, we'll eat and after that... - After that, we'll go dancing. - Yeah, well maybe you can call that, baby. Now, Brunilda you can anything you want anything at all. - Something from the bar? - Do you want a drink? - Yeah. - Yeah make it bourbon, twice. - Okay, thank you. - Alright. - Excuse me, I've got to powder my nose in a hurry. - Yeah, you better light your fuse. (barks) (soft jazzy dance music) - [Man] Bets have been made all around the country in the past 48 hours. We can really clean up. This horse is a favorite. The offer stands to lose a bundle. - [Man] You already tried to put in some kind of tricks, didn't you? - [Man] Just shut up and listen. My (mumbles) our way, got to stop that horse. - How can we do that? - Anything to stop him. Maybe a little. (soft jazzy music) - My fuse is lit. They don't call him Flash for nothing. - Flash are you absolutely sure about this? - Jim, I'm sure I know what I heard. Look here now, these are the type of dudes, man carry them guns and knives, man. They must of been maybe four or... - We better tell a track of fishes. - Charlie, wait a minute now. We're gonna look like absolute fools here if turns out Flash... - Jim, I tell you I heard them. - Let's go to the stables. - Alright. (sighing) - Atta boy, atta boy. - Charlie, what do you think? How's he look? - Oh he looks fine. Nobody's been messing with him. - Well Flash, I guess it was just a false alarm. - No, Charlie I, look Jim, I heard him, I heard him and I was cold sober. - Well tell you what, we better hang around just in case. - Let's go to the office and fix some coffee. - Alright.

(screams) (laughing) - You guys alright? - Yeah, you? - Yeah, I'm alright. - What happened, Charlie? - There's one over there, one here, and one down there. (laughing) - Alright. - Every race he just goes better and better, doesn't he? - I told you before and I'll tell you again. That thing is gonna win the derby. - Now remember, Monday is the final day for the entrance fee. - It will be here. Well we just won a pot full of money, didn't we? - Jim? - Uh oh, here comes trouble. - Are you alright? - Yeah, I'm alright. - Well they told me at the hotel you were still out here. Aren't you hurt? - No I'm not hurt now what are you doing here? - Well wasn't there a fight? - Who told you about that? - How about you, Charlie, are you hurt? - No, no I'm fine. There was a fight but we won. - Good. - Will you answer my question? What are you doing here? - I am certainly proud of the way you've all been handling yourself and my horse. - Your horse? - As a matter of fact. - that's our horse. It belongs. - I'm proud of everyone. Juanito and Eddie. Where's Flash? - Right here, Ms. Clarissa. Both physically and mentally. - You lied to me, you told me Jim was hurt. - Well he did get knocked about a bit. - Flash, what does she mean you told her? - Well Jim its funny I... - Flash has been checking with me from time to time. He told me you had nominated Champion and when I checked you hadn't paid the entry fee I took care of it for us. - You did? - Oh Jim, Champion was my horse. If he wins the derby, it will be just like winning for me. - You just can't stay out of my business, can you? - We all know Champion was your horse to start with but you gave up on him. Now Champion's gonna come through. You see, Ms. Clarissa, when you make a real friend, he never lets you down. We're all from the same farm, right? So its just like we're all from one big family. Everybody knows you love each other how come you don't act like it? (cheering) - Aright, alright. - Hey listen, you know that we're gonna win the derby. (overlapping cheering) - Hold on, let's get something straightened out. - Champion's gonna win the race wearing Ms. Clarissa colors and I'll be wearing the owners badge, then Charlie and Flash will get their old jobs back. - Alright. (cheering) - Thank you, Charlie. - Alright. (upbeat jazzy music) - Champion looks as if he's ready, we know that. - I think we're home free. - Pardon me, madam. Mr. Charles is waiting in the study. - Oh thank you, Mitchell. Excuse me, please. (humming) (laughs) - Ain't you pretty? Where'd you get that outfit? - Hey man, I've been promoted. I'm not longer horses nurse maid. I'm a horses assistant trainer. (laughing) (soft instrumental music) - [Clarissa VOICEOVER] A lame colt is a useless colt. You want it, you can have it. (soft instrumental music) - [Kid VOICEOVER] Your horse can't even run. - [Flash VOICEOVER ] His leg will explode into a million pieces. - [Clarissa VOICEOVER] You want it, you can have him. - [Kid VOICEOVER] Your horse is still a cripple! You hear me? He's a cripple. A cripple. - Here we are. Hello, Charlie, thank you for coming. - Hello Clarissa, thank you. - Charlie, how you doing? Nice to see you. - Nice to see you. - Charlie, how are you? - Hello, ,Carol. - I wanted to call us all together so we can have one drink, the five of us. - Thank you. - thank you. - First of all, to Jim and Carol have a very happy long life together. - Thank you. - I'll drink to that. - And to your first hole. - I'll drink to that. And to our horse. May he have a great day tomorrow. - Right on. - We'll win. - Champion. - A winner. - Huh Champion? Jim, Charlie, Flash, Eddie they're all talking about how you're gonna win tomorrow. No matter what happens, I still love you. You know? It just might happen, Champion. Just may be another horse faster than you. You know, you'll still be my champion. - Juanito, come on. Were you here all night again? Hey. Its alright. We're gonna win. - It was a lovely party last night, Clarissa. - Oh, thank you, dear. You know, while we're about it we really should start talking about plans for the wedding. - Look, Carol and I really haven't discussed it yet but I think that... - I think the engagement party should be held... - Now, wait a minute. I think you ought to listen to Jim because he's got something to say. - Oh, were you saying something dear? - I was trying to, yes. Clarissa, its our wedding, not yours. We'll decide how its gonna be. Wes, what are you turning in here for? (soft country classic music) - Well, how do you like it? - Oh its beautiful. You've done a marvelous job of restoring it. - Wes, if we don't get moving, we're gonna miss the derby. - Its your wedding present, with no strings and no interference. (laughs) - [Announcer] This 105th running of the derby is the fist jewel in the triple crown. Its going to be a wide open race. - I'm sorry boy, owners and trainers only allowed back here with the horses. - Know what, Flash. I guess that's us. - Uh, go right ahead, sir. (upbeat energetic fanfare) - [Announcer] And he's a man who knows his way around after bringing 10 horses to run this derby. Happy Dancer looks like the horse to beat today. Royal Champion is in the number two spot. Champion has had a brilliant spring but as you know, he has had some leg troubles some time back and we wonder if he can take the repeated punishment of the kind of racing he's been doing. Is Champion strong enough for this race? We'll see very soon. Royal Champion has the youngest owner of any of the horses running today, that's 13 year old Juanito Hernandez. The story of how Champion was given to young Juanito by Mrs. Clarissa Stewart a breeder well known to derby followers as almost unbelievable. Mrs. Stewart wanted to destroy the horse who no one thought had the makings of a winner. No one but Juanito that is. Number five, Hello Baby is another top contender with (mumbles), too. This horse has stamina, the kind of staying power that makes a winner. The oldest jockey ever to ride this derby is Ken Barry on Hello Baby. Ken is 57 years old and I tell you, he's seen some great derbies in his day. Cloud of War of the top four, the mystery horse is Run along, he has won six of his last six starts and we wonder, can he keep this kind of speed? He could be a come from behind horse, a mystery winner. The other seven making the run for the roses today all carry odds of 99 to one. Their owners know the chance of defeating those powerful top four are small but they hope to finish the race with a respectable time. The fastest the derby has even been run was by Secretariat in one minute 59 point two seconds. Across the nation and throughout the world people everywhere are waiting to hear about today's race. Who will win it, how fast and who will add his name... - [Announcer] Horses are on the track now for the derby at one mile and one quarter. The track is fast. Number one is Happy Dancer. Number two, Bold Warrior number three, Royal Champion, number four, If Ida, number five is Hello Baby, winners choice is number six Helen's Void, number seven number eight is Archduke, number nine Run Along, number 10 President, 11 is Mark's Kid and number 12, Melon. Now the horses are at the gate. Flag is out. (upbeat fanfare) and there they go! (cheering) Royal Champion, going to the front of Winner's Choice is second, Hello Baby, third (crowd cheering). Around the first bend and its Royal Champion in front by a half lane. (heart beating) (announcer drowned out by heartbeat) (crowd cheering) Now its Run Along in front. (heart beating) (crowd cheering) Run Along. Hello Baby is fourth. Bold Warrior. End of the stretch, its Royal Champion in front. Right two lanes. (heart beating) (crowd cheering) Coming up now, its Hello Baby. Royal Champion, Happy Dancer and Hello Baby. Here comes Happy Dancer on the outside. Royal Champion and Happy Dancer and Royal Champion quarter by a half lane. Happy Dancer is second with Ellen's Baby. (cheers) (upbeat fanfare) Number three Royal Champion was first, number one Happy Dancer second, number five, Hello Baby third. Time at the race, two minutes. - Let's go down to the winner's circle. Come on. (upbeat fanfare) - [Announcer] And in the winner's circle is Royal Champion with jockey Eddie Jones and the blanket of roses. (upbeat fanfare) - How do you feel? Do you feel like a champ? - That was close. - Close? - Yeah. - Makes you feel good you're a champ. - Yeah. - [Announcer] Mrs. Clarissa Stewart at Stewart Farms is accepting the trophy for Royal Champion's youth owner, Juanito Hernandez. (upbeat fanfare) - Excuse me, excuse me? - Who me? - You are the owner of Royal Champion, aren't you? - Yeah. - Well you're the one we want to talk to. Alright, Danny. Hello, this Bob Travers at the derby. With me is Juanito Hernandez owner of Royal Champion who ran for the blanket of roses today and is now wearing it proudly. Now this is a triumph for a horse who was born with a crippled leg and who made it all the way to the top on sheer guts and hearts. - What can I say, Champion was the fastest horse. - Yes, he sure was. Now tell our television audience what you did for Royal Champion to make him a winner. - Well, I believed in him. I've always believed in him. Champion knew it. - I see, that's very interesting. Now what's next for this magnificent thoroughbred? - Champions not gonna run anymore races if that's what you mean. - Well that's exactly what I mean. Now the rest of the triple crown lies ahead. Your horse can take the Preakness at Belmont Stakes and carry you on to even greater glory. - Why people like horses only when they do things for them? I mean I like Champion because he's my horse and he's my friend. Now he's not gonna race anymore. I think he's had a enough. - But there's a lot of money to be made. - Well Champion doesn't care about the money and plus, we have enough for what we needed. See, my horse has gone through a lot, mister. He had a big operation, and he almost got killed in a fire. Look, now he's just won the biggest race of them all and I think that's enough, don't you? - He can still make millions if you let him run. - Well, look I want Champion to be happy and I think he's happy he's won now. Now, he's just gonna have some fun. - Now surely you must be joking. A horse of Royal Champion's talents just can't be left alone to relax and eat and play with you. - Why not?
