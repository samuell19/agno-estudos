Good morning. - You're it! - No, you're it! - Morning, sir. - Morning, girls. Where's Gabrielle? Home. I will bring her next time. - Please do. - We need her. To play with us. Here's your money. How's work? As usual. You still won't tell me what you're working on. No. And I probably never will. If I tell you, you too will think I'm crazy. You know that's not true. You know you can trust me. But I do think you're crazy when you fall asleep in less then a minute. Guilty. I'm sorry, I'm just a bit curious that's all. I know. That's why you were my favorite student 'cause of your curiosity. Was that the only reason? Well. Are you going to sleep now? Probably. Uh-uh. Daddy! Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong? I saw him, I saw him! Calm down, honey. Who? What happened? I saw him, it was the monster! Calm down, Gaby, calm down. Remember what I told you, he is not here. He can't be everywhere, right? But he came to me and- In your dreams. But what did we say? Who is in charge of your dreamworld? Who's the queen? Me. This is our world, not his. - Our world, okay. - Yes. Okay? Now go back to bed. If you see him tell him I'm going to kick his ass if he tries to scare you again, okay. Okay. All right, now go. They called today. Who called? The faculty. They wanted to know how you were. And what did you tell them? That you're fine. Do you think that we see the entirety of everything that's around us in a world? What do you mean? Well, we rely on our senses, sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch to experience the world, but can we say with certainty that there isn't more to the world than what we perceive with our senses? Just think about it, what would it be like to actually see music? Now what if we haven't yet developed senses to perceive other things around us? What if we have lost them a long time ago to sense things, other things beyond the scope of our imagination? You are ahead of our time. I know that. It's a cold morning, eh? You're not cold? Sorry to wake you up. Leave my rope alone. Uh, leave it alone. I've told you hundreds of times, it's mine, and mine only. If you need it that bad buy yourself one. You're stupid. You've always been stupid. I don't even know what I'm gonna do with you all day. Well, well, good morning to you. Where's Gaby? Did she come? Uh, no, not today, soon. Don't worry, tomorrow. I promise. See you, sir. Hello, my friend. Morning, Professor. How are you feeling today? Very well. How are you? Good, as always. I received a call from the faculty yesterday. Yes, I told them to call you. What can I do for you, Professor? Well, you didn't answer my calls yesterday, so I wanted to check out on you. I'm sorry about that. I, I was just too tired. I was working all day on my research. And how is that going? Good for now. We will see. You came there to rest. You need to do so. I came here to finish my work, Professor. And when you finished, will you come back? I won't be coming back, sir. All I need is to figure this out. I'm this close. I, I can feel it. It won't bring her back. Excuse me? Your wife. She is dead, Professor. Your research will not bring her back. Stop doing this and come back to us. Your students need you. With all do respect, sir, it was you that kicked me out. I mean not you, but the faculty did. They did not kick you out. They suspended you, Professor. It's the same thing to me. I don't care. ...kick you out. Ready? Did you know that the folding chess board was invented by a priest in 1125. Since the church forbid priests to play chess he hide the board by making it look like two books lying next to each other. So it's a Devil's game. If you believe in him then yeah. And what if all this around us is a game just like this one? We're merely actors played on the stage of life and this world is an illusion. No one really dies. No one is really hurt. You're getting better. I'm not as good as you are, Professor, but still I have my moves. You're just so unpredictable. Sometimes I think you're cheating. I'm not that good at chess. No, you're not, but you might be good at cheating. I played chess every day with my students, picked up a lot of moves from them. Maybe you learned how to cheat too. If you think I'm a cheat then why do you play chess with me? I'm trying to figure it out. Ah, hello, my friend. Did someone see my ax? I can't work without my ax. I haven't seen it. Did you finish? Yeah. But now I can't find my fuckin' ax. I'll kill those thieves if I find them. This is actually really nice. You could be a carpenter. Carpenter, carpenter, me? I didn't mean to offend you. Those fuckin' kids took it. I guarantee you, I'll fuckin' kill them when I see them. You should be more careful with that ax. Someone could get hurt. So young, so frustrated. Let him be. Play. What? Checkmate. Really? Maybe next time, my friend. You always say that. Only when I win. Well, it's time for me to go. It was a pleasure playing with you. Yeah, yeah. Well, see you tomorrow. Maybe then I'll beat you. Yeah, maybe. The plants died again. Maybe we're doing something wrong. Abby, but you've seen it. Every plant Dad brings home after a while just dies. This time it won't happen, okay. We'll prove that it has nothing to do with him, never had. Hey, we'll get you another one. We'll save it this time, okay? You promise? I promise. Fucking hammer! Fucking Christ, this is a piece of shit! Can't work like this! Fuck you! Fucking hammer! Fuck! Abby, I'm not really in the mood for that. Let me guess, you are tired. Look, Abby, I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you, I promise. I know. You know our plant died. I don't know what's wrong with those plants. Me neither. Doesn't make any sense. At least she hasn't had one of those nightmares last night. She lost her mother, don't let her lose her father as well. I know. I'll take her with me tomorrow. Please do. Why is the toilet locked? You okay, Gaby? Yeah. What do you think about her? She's fine. She was so happy today, I don't know why. You know she's doing her best, right? Yeah, I know. But she can't replace Mom. No, but give her chance. Go play. I'll pick you up when I'm done. Okay. We haven't seen you for so long. - I suppose. - Maybe she has a new friend. I don't. Mony's jealous. Here, I'll count for you. One, two. One, two. Faster, faster, faster, faster! I'm okay. Do you like it? Yeah, it's beautiful. Does it die? Everybody dies. But this one doesn't. Really, can I take it? No, it's mine. But there are a lot of them in the woods. You're eating too much sugar my friend. Indeed. It accelerates my brain. That's your plan to beat me. No. I just like eating sugar. Makes me think fast. Okay, whatever makes you happy. Mm-hmm. You know the pond is artificial. It was made by people so they could go fishing. Yeah, I know. And there's some theory about a crazy fish. I don't like those kind of theories. Well, there may be some truth in the story. What about those crazy fish? He swims vertically or upside down when he's hunting. In our pond? Where else? You should ask the old Boatman. What about him? Well, he loves fishing. Do you think something's wrong with him? He doesn't speak. I noticed. And it has something to do with the crazy fish. How? A couple of years ago I, I read an article about a man and a cow. A man lived in a village and he had a cow. It was everything to him. Every day he would feed her, brush her, speak to her. And then the cow died. He grieved. He stopped speaking. And then every evening he would go to the stable and sleep. He started eating straw and drinking water from the bucket. The man became a cow. So he went mad. No, not that kind of madness. And what's this all got to do with the Boatman? He caught the crazy fish. That kind of craziness. And then fish got back in the pond. He never saw it again. This really makes sense. You shouldn't laugh. That was quick. I must go find Gabrielle. You let me win. Shame on you. Luci? Mony? Daddy, Daddy! Gabrielle, where were you? I was looking for you all over the place. I saw him, I saw him! - Who? - The monster here in the woods. Gabrielle, there is no monsters here or anywhere. This has to stop. But I saw him. What were you doing there anyway? Don't go in the woods alone. Why don't you believe me? Mom would believe me. What happened? She got lost in the woods. Oh my God. Is she okay? She's fine. How was your day with Luci and Mony? She's talking to you, Gaby. Fine. Eat your food. I'm not hungry. I wanna go to bed. Okay, let's go. I just wanted to find a new plant. One that won't die. I know. But daddy scared me. He didn't believe me. He's just worried, my love. He's working too much, and he's under a lot of pressure. So forgive him if he loses his temper sometimes. He loves you very much. And I love you very much. I love him too. And you too. Hi. Hi, Mony. Can I wait with you? Sure. You seem a bit different lately. Sorry, I think that's because I'm a little distracted. Have you been working too much? I guess so. What are you working on? Well, I'm the pond keeper. What do you keep? Everything I guess. I know how you feel. Where's your sister? I don't know. I ran off, I get angry. She thinks I'm selfish, and it's true. But it's because of her. I inherit all of her old or small clothes and ugly dolls. You can buy new things. It's too expensive. We don't need to spend more money. Yeah, you're right. But I'll tell you a secret. I have stolen her favorite doll. A lot of things happened, but it's all clear to me now. There are symbols everywhere, here, in the woods, in the pond, even in my home. This is why I think we are not here by accident. The system works without our will. The world is made of circles and we are in the middle of those circles. And they are turning around, and around, and, and just stop. When she died I, I wanted to know why. Why did she have to go? I was looking for answers, why her? Why do we all have to go through this immense pain? Sorry, Professor. Give me one moment. Listen, I'm quite concerned about something. Has he ever told you anything about the circles? No. Then go and check it out. Where are you going? Stay here. But where are you going? I have to go up to the university. Lock the door. You're such a idiot! You're an idiot! Psycho! No, I'm not, you're the psycho. I'm not the the psycho. Stop! Ah, ow! Idiot! You're so stupid. No you're stupid! You psycho! - You're such a idiot! - Stop it! You're stupid, ow! Hey girls! I'm gonna get you! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Have you lost your minds? Hey, these kids, eh. What kids? Luci and Mony. Luci and Mony are at home, Professor. What are you talking about? No, but they were just right here. You must of seen them run past here. I must, I must be tired. So much so you can't play another game. It seems so. Hm, so you're rejecting me. No, that's not what I'm saying. Then it's time for a rematch. Play tricks on you. Come on. I think its one-one, isn't it? Timothy, 3:1-4. But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God. The darkness drops again, but now I know that 20 centuries of stony sleep were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, and what rough beast, its hour come round at last slouches towards Bethlehem to be born. You're under the weather today, Professor. I am. Why? Sorry, I can't play. Raincheck. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to accelerate your stress levels. What did you just say? I didn't mean to accelerate your stress levels. Raincheck. The monster is here! Where? There's no one here. It was just here. Don't be scared. It was probably just a mouse stuck somewhere. Daddy will open it and fix it when he gets back, okay? Okay. Let's change. What the hell? The Boattman, he caught it with his bare hands. He said, "Fish is running out of time." He's right. At least about this one. How is Gabrielle? She's upset. Did you go out today? I was home all day. What are you doing? What? What's going on here? Good day, Professor. Please. Sit. Who gave you the key? Please, Professor. Please, sit down. I'll make us some tea. Who gave you the key? And why are you here? Easy, Professor. Sometimes in life things just happen. Things don't just happen. And sometimes it's hard to understand it. I'm a scientist, please spare me the lecture. Ah, now you're a scientist. Just get to the point. Let's have some tea first. I don't have time for this bullshit. I want to know what's going on. Well, obviously I figured it out. What do you even mean? You weren't cheating. But it doesn't matter anymore. You're upset 'cause I refused to play last time. I was a little sad, but not upset. I'm certainly not that kind of man. Okay, what kind of man are you? You wanna play now? Not anymore. I was sitting by the pond, waiting for you and they came and brought me a letter. Who? What, what letter? And I opened the letter and inside there was nothing. Not a word, just a small blue envelope... addressed to me. And we both know what that means. It sounds like a mystery but it's not. Obviously someone reported you. It was you. Frankly, I don't give a damn. I was playing chess with you every day and you reported me. Well, maybe you shouldn't be playing chess during working hours. You're a real predator. I've fought people like you all my life. And now you must leave. Leave? I know what my job is, I don't need you anymore. I will never leave this cabin. Then I will throw you out. I won't be the first. Professor. It's all clear now, Professor. Is what clear? Acceleration theories. I don't understand. Circles are narrowing, moving toward the center. Look I really need you to trust me on this, okay? Please, you're my only hope, Professor. You're the only person I can trust. What about Abby? I don't know, maybe she's gone crazy too. Listen, what if I told you that we live in Hell already? Hell? What hell are you talking about? Look, when my wife died I, I, I was depressed. I asked myself why did she have to go? Does it have something to do with my life, with Gabrielle's? Why her? Why not some killer? It's 'cause we are already in Hell. I found proof. Oh, did you? Dante was explaining how Hell works. Not because he was inspired about it or he was fantasizing about something he, he, it was his description of our mankind. He was talking about this, Hell. He knew. Go on. Listen, listen to me carefully, acceleration is constant. I found a frequency of it. I figured it out. Look at this scheme. I'm sending it right now. People are around me went completely mad. The stupid Chess Player took my place. You are far away, but if you were here you would see it for yourself. Something happened, someone reported me. They're going to be here any minute. And I think, and I think it's got something to do with my research. What the hell is going on there? Nobody's taking my work! I'm the only one who understand this place, and the stupid crazy fish, and the crazy girls, and the crazy Boattman! They're all crazy and they're trying to make me crazy too and steal my life! I'm not sure I understand. This is, this is... The truth. The place and the time. The circle is turning towards the center. And the center is? Here on this island. What you're trying to say is, that all your research comes to you being the center of the world. My theory is that we are in Hell already, and that we are descending more and more. I know you will say that we had more crimes, more violence, and more wars. That was confusing me too, but Hell is not about the fact that we are killing or hating each other more. Hell is that we are slowly giving away. We are not controlling ourselves. That it is very important, because understanding that we know this we can change. That is our only hope. You were my student and I gave you my knowledge. How did you come up with this that the world circles around you? I don't understand, I don't understand. The, the events and the numbers they all show clearly that. Oh, you will understand, you will understand definitely. What do you mean? You always thought you were better than anyone else. This idea could have been mine. You're no better than me, trust me. I want to tell you I heard a song in a dream. When I heard the song I realized that you were right. The end is near. What song? I, what? I don't understand. Do not wake him up, he is dreaming. If he opens his eyes he will not see us anymore. If he wakes we will cease to exist. If we stop playing to him, he will have nightmares. If it may be so then the world is still in Hell. So be quiet, he's asleep. So sing in silence while he dreams. He dreams of the world, and the world dreams of him. The silence of the noise. The light of the darkness. Eternal to the end. Professor, what are you doing? No! No! Do not wake him up, he is dreaming. If he opens his eyes he will not see us anymore. If he wakes up, we will cease to exist. If we stop playing to him, he will have nightmares. If so it may be so our world will stay in Hell. So be quiet, he is asleep. Let's sing in silence while he dreams. He dreams of a world while the world dreams of him. In the silence of a noise, in the darkness of a light, eternal in the end. You should go play with them. I have something to finish. Come, Gabrielle. Play with us. Abby, please don't leave me here. Please, take the masks off. Come on, Gabrielle, play with us. Don't be so arrogant. Gaby! Gaby! Gaby! Where's my daughter? I don't know. You're the father. You can stop playing games now, just tell me where she is. Oh, come on, like you care. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, darling, I saw it. She became scared of you. I'm not sure she even loves you anymore. That is a lie. You never even cared about her, just like you never cared about your wife. Be quiet. You can't fool me. Remember when we met in your classroom. The way you looked at my eyes, my hair, my legs. You forgot all about your wife, did you? That is not true. I loved my wife, and I love Gaby with all my heart. I would do everything to have my family back. You know, when we met the only thing I saw in your eyes was desire, not love. Gaby! Gaby! Gaby! Gaby! Gaby! Gaby! Hey, girls. Have you seen Gaby? Come on, Gabrielle, play with us. Gaby! Dad, come on. Gaby, I want you to know how much I love you. Dad, what are you doing? Come on. You must face your fears. They will disappear as if they never existed. Dad, please. Dad. I'm sorry for everything. Do you what checkmate means? It means the king is dead. It's a Persian word. Shah met, they called it. Why are you here? Well, my friend, I could ask you the same question. You all made me. And who are we again? Professor. What do you want from me? Did you know that the phrase the king is dead came from France and it was used by the son of a King known as the Beloved and Mad. He said, "The king is dead." Long live the king. Please, spare me. I'm not crazy even if you want me to be. Perhaps. But we don't know that. What are you trying to say? What I'm trying to say is that the king is dead is an announcement that a king has just died. And long live the king, the first of the heir, who immediately takes over the throne upon the death of the preceding ruler. Funny how they took that from a game of chess. What do you want from me? I just wanna play a game of chess with you that's all. What about them? Well, they're all different. We're all different. You won't get my research. What's so funny? Humans, you all think the same thing. Oh, yeah, and what's that? That you're special. I mean you are, but not in every story. You remind me of my brother. Oh, by the way it was him that wanted your research not me. He couldn't stand that you found out about us. And what about the rest of you? Everyone gets what they wanted. He got what he wanted. He didn't get my research. It's in safe hands. My brother, no, no, he won't. You're right about that, but I wasn't talking about him. Who are you talking about then? About him. The masked man. If that's what you call him. And what does he want? This is not about you, friend. Where's Gaby? Every plant Dad brings home after a while just dies. This is about the successor. The one who will act as prophet for them all. What are you talking about? You created Hell by believing in it. And now is the perfect time for him to come. But there can't be. Those who don't believe in the Devil already belong to him. What do you mean? But Daddy scared me. He didn't believe me. I saw him, I saw him! The monster here in the woods! Gabrielle, there is no monsters. He's already chosen his successor, my friend, thanks to you. No. No. My friend, you lost this time. Checkmate. Or should I say the king is dead. Long live the king.
