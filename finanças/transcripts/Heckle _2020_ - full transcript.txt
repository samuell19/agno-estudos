Look Laura, Laura. Come inside a moment. You have a missed call from me. Everybody this is Laura. I think you've met. Oh hi. How are you? Oh, you know, I've been better. I do know. Let's put the kettle on, shall we. If you guys want to start the movie. I'm going for a swim. A swim? A swim, a sauna, whatever. I just need to clear my head. We're at a party. Yeah well I need to relax. He's lost his damn mind. David go and talk to him. Oh come on Catherine. There's no point in talking to him when he's in one of his moods. He's worse than me! I knew this was a bad idea. What're you doing? You said there's a spa, I'm going for a swim. Are you fucking insane? I have to go. You're going back to that pub? Promise me you're not planning on drinking. I promise. I promise! Okay? Hello, you've lost your friend? I just needed some air. Hope I didn't scare you off earlier. So, what can I get you? Scotch, neat. Double? Yeah why not. Here you go. It's on the house. A whiskey for the movie star. Do you know who that Range Rover outside belongs to? Planning on buying it? Good stuff right? Another? I'd best not. Ah, go on. Whoa. Whoa, the next one's on me. Dude, you were brilliant earlier. Hey, you know that Ray Kelly guy you're playing? I met him once. Would you like to take again, sir? 19. House, 21 blackjack. House wins. Unlucky chance. I'm a fan. You got a ticket in your pocket? A ticket? You got a theater ticket? A fucking theater ticket? You got one? Uh no. We're doing a show tonight. Oh yeah, I know. If you're such a big fucking fan, why don't you have a theater ticket in your pocket? I'm broke. You're broke and your fucking sitting here playing fucking cards? You're fucking betting like a fucking whore. You just lost a fan. Come on little fuck! Mr. Kelly! Come on! You wanna fucking play games? Come on! Come on. That's a hell of a story. - I've got to get going. - No. Shots? No, thanks. You get home safe, yeah? All right then. What the hell? Ahh, fuck! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. Stop fucking following me! Yes, I'm fine. Excuse me, do I know you from somewhere? I'm Joe Johnson, the comedian. Of course you are. How stupid of me. Is that your Jeep outside? It is. Because I saw it earlier too. Outside the pub. Oh yeah, I park it outside there for business. I'm an electrician. I can't park outside where we're working, so you know it's funny, I've never once set foot inside that pub. - Are you fucking with me? - What? You're fucking with me! Excuse me? It's not even your voice! You live in London. - Listen, you've got me confused. - It was you! I live here! You heckled me! You're the heckler! I'm sorry. I really have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, yes, yes. When it does go to print make sure it's in big bold letters, Ray Kelly and his wife were found gunned down in their home. Hmm. For the last time. Yes, Ray and his wife were found gunned down in their home, seemingly without motive. I know. It is a bit bizarre, isn't it? Who hung this on the front door?! Did somebody here do this? Babe, are you drunk? No I'm not fucking drunk! Joe, we've all been sat in here since you left. I know I must, Catherine, that heckler from the other night. I think he's crazy. I picked on the wrong guy, and took it too far. And now he's stalking me. He followed us here, he called me at the pub, and described the shirt I was wearing. It's him! He hung this on the front door! It was probably just kids. You know, the old killer clown thing. But there's nobody for miles. Right? You son of a bitch. You dumb asses, he's messing with you. Oh brilliant! Brilliant! He got me! Hah aha! Good one mate. More convincing than yours, babe. Fuck yeah, feel my heart beating. Agreed. Brilliant. Where did you get that stupid mask? There was a service station on the way. Excuse me. Lucie! Lucie look, I'm flattered. Oi! Lucie! Just a sec. I'm going out for a smoke. Can you get rid of this psychopath, so we can all have a drink? Evelyn. Can you give us a minute? What are you plans? Throwing me out? No. I'm just asking. You don't give a shit do you? Since we got married I waited for you to fall in love with me. But you never did. I just want you to be happy. And I'm happy with you. I can't do this. Come on, just fuck me. I need it. Hmm? This shit is potent. Well give us some then. Mmm. How are them big titties anyway? These are just me dad's headphones. Mmm. You're so hard. You're a crazy bitch. She could do with a few tokes. Why don't we go check out that creepy garden then? Let's go girl. Knock, knock. How does it feel knowing you are going to die tonight. What will you miss? The applause? The whisky? Will you miss the pictures she draws for you? Are you trying to be profound? Because this stuff is painful. Do you make other people sit through this shit? No Joe. Only you. Well look I'm flattered. But I like women. I know you do. How about you? Do you have any hobbies aside from this amateur stalking thing? It's hilarious. I mean, are you outside right now? Looking in, watching my every move? You must be cold. Why don't you come in and join the party? I'm not really a party guy. Yeah I didn't think so. I can think of better ways to entertain myself. Chronic masturbation? Let's get back to those late night empty roads, you travel as you tour. You are so lame. The loneliness of those roads must be a constant reminder of those empty super market aisles. The day your daddy disappeared. Poor little Joe. The movie star all alone in the world. Like he is in the room right now. Bye Joe. It's show time. I knew you'd follow me. You know what I hate the most? She'll be your date at the film premiere. Oh, oh, hello Joe. Oh naughty boy. Oh. Wow, okay. What are you doing now Joe? Joe not so high, my stomach! Joe. Joe please. Joe! Joe stop it. Would you hurry up and cum already? It's got a bit boring now. Hurry up I'm freezing my tits off. You okay? Yeah. You look like you were about to have a heart attack. Don't die on me. I'll try not to. Well thanks for that. I can take sex in the woods off my bucket list. Lucie. Are you using me for sex? You are? Joe tried it on me earlier. He tried to kiss me. Oh shit. What is that it? What do you want me to do, smack him or something? It might make things a bit awkward. You're a prick aren't you? I'm supposed to be your girl. Look, I'll have a word with him later. Well yeah. Did you hear that? Some mad man showed up with an axe in the woods. No. I'm being serious this time. Yeah sure. Luke? Luke? If you jump out at me I'll fucking kill you. Fuck this. I'm ignoring ya. Well that's an improvement. Hey. Hi. You look shattered. Yeah, oh. Went for a run. Where is Catherine? Oh I don't know. She had to write a press release or something. Here, don't tell anyone, but she snuck her laptop in. Bloody workaholic. Yeah, it seems this movie has taken over everyone's life. What are you doing? Oh come on. What the fuck? You held my eyes at dinner last night. No, you held mine and it creeped me out. David, take your hands off me please. Oh, sorry I misunderstood. Yeah, I think you did. Joe. Joe? Ahh. Fuck. What? What was that? I thought you wanted to! Not like that. You used me. Oh come on Cat. I need a cigarette. You gave up. Yeah just like you gave up booze. Evelyn! I don't want to talk to you right now. Look I didn't buy the mask at the service station. He's here. Who's here? There is somebody here. I saw them from the window. Oh the heckler? I don't know, he was wearing a clown mask, or something. Get over yourself. You're not being stalked. You're just delusional. Oh my god. Laura! We have to go where are your keys? In the house. Well where is he? I don't know! What does he want? To destroy me. He called me this morning. This morning, and you didn't think to tell anyone! They were here! Don't you know how to hot wire a car? I can't even tune a radio. We got to call for help. The fucking line is dead. Joe do something! Shh! Laura, she called me earlier. She has a phone. Just wait here. No fucking way. Joe! Shit, shit, shit! Take it! Fucking take it! I did warn you Joe. Dangerous profession of yours. After all, look what happened to Ray Kelly. Holy fuck, you killed Ray Kelly?
