He couldn't get here in time for the qualifying. - All right, let's get it over with. Ready Mr. Wilson? (engine roars) - Never thought he'd come back, especially to this track. - Yeah in the car that killed Billy Johnson. - Lousy Leadfoot. - When are we going to see dad? - In the morning baby. - I want you and dad together again. It's a long time since we've been a family. (car engine roars) - Well? - He qualified. - You'll get the official okay in the morning. - Thank you. - Thank you Liz, thank you for helping him come back. You must have a special magic in you. - I'm his friend. - Too bad his father didn't treat him that way. Let's hope this works. - Let's hope so Mrs. Wilson. - Oh ho ho. Well she's not a bad car after all. - You could be going first class in the Seratti tomorrow. Why are you driving dad's old car? - We're old friends again. - You're not afraid anymore? - It was like a bad dream. It happened to someone else. - We'll see your father at the track tomorrow. - He's going to have to meet me halfway mom. - He will. We'll see you two back at the house. - Bye. - I have the feeling I shouldn't have gotten on that plane with you at Milan. - Well I would have preferred a small yacht. - Your mother she keeps looking at me like a bride. - She sees a love light in your eyes Liz. - You know I didn't want that. - Give me time Liz. Maybe you'll change your mind. You know I'm a very persuasive guy. - I know. Come on, we're going to be late for dinner. (car engine roars) - [Announcer] Coming down into turn five heading for the finish, it looks like Val Houston has it made, but believe it's gonna be a close one here. So keep your eyes on that track, what's this? 23 he comes on the turn, but he straightens that out nice. He here comes now, Val Houston in car number 23. Second place, Les Frane, right behind him Dean Scott. The red flag is on now. Let's keep off the track. Val Houston will be taking his victory lap. The course will be open in just a few minutes, so please no spectators on the track. Here's the latest weather report, raining now in San Francisco and it's moving south, but I think we'll make it through the day here at Monterey. Here he is on the track, the winner of this big race with his victory lap-- - Everything all right? - He qualified. - It's official, good luck. - Thanks a lot sis. - [Announcer] In the main event next, we have it official. The driver of the D Jag Special by the Wilson Seratti Distributing Company will be none other than Rob Wilson. Now Rob you might recall quit racing three seasons ago after he was involved in a fatal crash on this very track. Rob made a terrific comeback in Europe last month, winning the Milan Classic. Welcome back to American racing, Rob! - Where is your mother? (suspenseful orchestral music) - What's wrong? - Nothing, may be a little tense. - He'll never come to me. - Hello Harry. - Hello Alice, Joanie. - Hello dad. - Hi Greg. - Hi there, hello Mrs. Wilson. - I can't shake hands beautiful, so you come here and kiss me. - Hi Kit. - Hi there. - Rob's waiting to see you. - Well there's nothing I could say to him that he'd listen to. - Oh daddy that's not fair. He's made a new start winning at Milan. Can't you be proud of him? - Winning isn't new to Rob. Have you forgotten he also won the day Billy Johnson was killed? - Why do you keep blaming him for what happened? - Please Harry. - You never wanted him in racing. Why did you bring him back? - He can't walk away from it on his own until he pleases you on your terms. - He doesn't have to please me, not anymore. - But he does, he's racing for you in the car you built for him. He'll win for you. - Not for me. It's no use. He doesn't love racing and that's what I wanted just as much the winning. With all his gold cups, I'd give a dozen rounds for one Greg Morgan. Now here's a boy who took a scrap heap and created a fine precision machine. He did it all himself too. I gave Rob a fine car and it was just like a loaded gun in the hands of an angry kid. - You loaded the gun Harry. You made him angry. Believe me Rob doesn't want to be angry anymore. Neither do I. - All right. I'll see him after the race. - I'll be with you in a minute mom. I want to see Greg. - Meet me at the coffee stand. See you later Harry. - [Announcer] The course is open now. Spectators may now cross the track. - I'm sorry, Greg. I know you didn't want to hear family talk. - I'm sorry too. One thing Joanie, please tell your mother I'm not trying to replace Rob or make Harry think I'm better than he is. - She knows. Call me after the race. - Sure. - Okay Greg? - Maybe we can all get together tonight. - This may come as a shock to your Joanie, but I know how to use a telephone too. - I like you too Kit, see you. - Keep dialing that phone boy. She'll get your signal. - All I get is a busy signal waiting for her to get off your line. - Greg, if Rob gives you any trouble, I want you to pull in. Don't take any chances. - I'll take his exhaust pipes for a while and feel him out. - How do you want to feel it? When he hits you broadside in the turn? - Look, I never drove a race with Rob and I've never seen him lead foot it through when anyone was in the way. I don't buy his reputation. - I'm sorry to say it, but it's true. - I know you feel Harry, but until Rob proves it otherwise, Rob and Billy Johnston just had an accident, that's all. - Greg, listen to me. My eyes don't lie. It's all photographed right up in here and it keeps reeling through my head. Don't you think I'd like to change it? Don't you think I'd like to forget it? Here let me show you. Coming into that narrow turn, number five, Farrell and Johnson were in the lead. Johnson on the outside, Rob was right on Billy's tail. There wasn't room enough for the three of them, but Rob lead footed right through before that narrow turn bottled up. He never let up. Billy had only one place to go or he'd have killed both of them. He went off the cliff. - You better watch yourself Greg. - [Announcer] Drivers in the main event, report to the judge's stand for the driver's meeting. - Remember to check the mixture. It was still too lean. (tense orchestral music) - Greg? (tense orchestral music) I had hoped you would meet me at the airport. I guess I knew you wouldn't, but I waited for you. - You sent the cable too late. - You would have come? - Two years ago, a year ago. - You mean the cable came on time, but too late. - A moment ago, I started to run toward you. It was like a reflex, but I managed to stop myself and now I'm gonna walk the other way. - Wait Greg, if you never let me see you again, at least I want you to know, I've never forgiven myself. - I don't believe you. It was a big hurdle Liz. Does it matter that I can't trust you? - I could hope in time you might. - Time, I want to run past it and not go back. I race against it. - I'll wait, any time, any place. - I'll be seeing you Liz. (car engine roars) - [Announcer] All right ladies and gentlemen, we're just about ready, all the cars qualified for this big race. This is the 25 lap race. We're at the starting line. They've given the signal to get those engines turning over. Looks like they're all set. We should have the start here. There we go, they're off and it's a good, clean start. Everybody getting underway, all in good order, all in proper position. It's gonna go somewhat easily on this first lap as they peel out this track because it's gonna be a long, hard ride, 25 grueling laps. No one is gonna take any chances. Wait a minute, Rob Wilson at number 204, the D Jag Special has started to make a couple of moves here. He's trying to improve his position. Goes through between two more cars and he's moving up. He's passing Sinclair in car number 64. They're heading for Leadfoot Alley. That's where turn number five bottles up. Only car at a time can get through. Brandon, car number 112 in the lead, next is Pauly in number 85 followed by Rob Wilson. Over here, he's laid through the turn (voice drowned out roaring engines) peeling out the track the competition is gonna get tougher though as these 25 laps unroll. It'll be a long time before we flag down that winner and a lot of things are gonna happen look out somebody's put on the heat. And you can see them pick up the dust. (car wheels screeching) Okay at the start of the second lap. It's still Brandon, Pauly and Wilson, going into turn one, Sinclair in 64 is ahead of car number 70, Greg Morgan and the Sinclair going up in speed coming up on the look out Sinclair going too far. He's in trouble, he's all right though he just skids out. I think he can get back on the track. I think the car will be okay. He's back there, but he's lost a lot of mileage with that spin out. In the meantime, Rob Wilson trailing along in the field, at the present time the leader is still Bill Brandon in the Mercedes, car number 112 and the old Bucket of Bolts number 70 driven by Greg Morgan. That's that right car on the track, pushing up on the field as well, Greg Morgan trailing behind Rob Wilson at the present time, going through the turn somewhere easily. (voice drowned out by car engines roaring ) He's back here on the track again. Lap time for the leader, one minute, 24 seconds, right from the start here in lap three, it looks like a real contest developing between Rob Wilson and Greg Morgan in third and fourth places. We'll be keeping our eye on them as well as our lap three leader Bill Brandon in the Mercedes, that's car number 112. He's in front with the field somewhat crunched up behind him at the present time. Here we go onto that next turn and Rob Wilson making a move now to pass car number 85 and following right behind in his tail wash Greg Morgan is also taking out Pauly. So now it is Brandon, Wilson and Morgan running first, second and third. (dramatic orchestral music) Greg Morgan at number 70, running in third spot and very close to Robert Wilson's number 204. A little more distance in the Mercedes driven by Bill Brandon who still holds the lead. He's been in front all the way in this race, Bill Brandon in that car number 112. There's a big battle for second and third place now between Greg Morgan in number 70 and Rob Wilson in 204. Falling along in this long race, the strain beginning to tell on some of the drivers who are straggling back from these leaders some way. (car engines roaring) One of the toughest tracks of them all, on the straightaway for long and they can really put their foot in if they want to and to really compete on the straightaways they have to take it easy on the dangerous turns. (dramatic orchestral music) (car engines roaring) Bill Brandon in number 112, that Mercedes, he holds that lead. In second is Rob Wilson in number 204 and Greg Morgan in that number 70 right behind him. It looks like Greg Morgan is gonna put the pressure on Rob Wilson all the way in this race and then perhaps make his move just a little bit later on. He keeps going after him, taking chances, coming close on some of those turns, but I think that he's gonna be all right. Came very close on one just then. Wilson still holds that second place and Morgan right behind him. What a job well done, he just keeps driving and hits the opportunity and ahead of them both of course is still Bill Brandon. They're getting in position. Still coming along, 14 into the race. Getting challenged through the long ride, the sun shining in the eyes of these drivers. They've still got some laps to go. (dramatic orchestral music drowns out voice) Last lap, last lap and Rob Wilson holding second place, Greg Morgan still right behind him. The Mercedes first, Rob Wilson is closing last goal and he perhaps is going to try to make a move here. He's going by and he's passed Brandon and Morgan is moving up as well. He's passing inside of Rob Wilson and I think he made it, so it is Morgan first and then Rob Wilson second as they head into the shoot for Leadfoot Alley. (dramatic orchestral music) (car engines roaring) This very dangerous part of track here the last lap. This could be the most important one. Greg Morgan out in front setting a terrific pace. He might lap Sinclair's car in 64. I think he's going to be able to do that, but he better do it before Leadfoot Alley. Now let's see if he's gonna make the move. Here he goes. Greg Morgan is wide. It may be too late to for Wilson unless he applies, let's see if Wilson also is gonna try to no. Wilson falls back, takes it easy on that one. He backs off instead of trying to go through Leadfoot Alley. So out in front now of course is Greg Morgan and in the mean time it appears that Wilson had passed Sinclair but Morgan is still in front here in this last half lap of the race. Rob Wilson trying to move up on him, but Wilson lost a lot of ground when he had to back off there in Leadfoot Alley. He just wouldn't take a chance. He eased off and now he may have taken himself right out of that race, but here he comes moving up once again on Morgan. Rob Wilson and that's car number 204, gets up inside has to ease off again as Morgan once more puts his foot into it on the big straightaway and now of course there's the finish line. It's the finish. It's Greg Morgan by a half car length and Rob Wilson in second. Greg Morgan and his brother Kit Morgan have done it again, number 70, the old Bucket of Bolts the car these brothers built in their own backyard. American Grand Prix, the Grand Prix race of the season, the best drivers and cars from Europe and America. - Greg! Congratulations! - Hey Rob, your old man is waiting for you by your pit. - I came here to see him. - Well I'll go tell him. - It's funny. We're only supposed to meet each other halfway. - I've been wanting to meet you Rob. - My father didn't paint the picture too black? - 25 laps on that track told me much more about you than he could. You're better behind the wheel than I am. The cars made the difference. - Now don't get so noble. You put a trap on my back and I didn't pull any punches when you finally showed me your tail pipes. - You could have gotten mean in Leadfoot Alley. Holding back wasn't easy for you. - Old Bucket of Bolts scared me too much. What have you got under this hood? - My blood and Harry's spare parts. - Terrific race, Greg. - Thanks. (car engine roars) (tender orchestral music) - It's good to see you son. - It's good to be home dad. Let's go see mom. - Now wait a minute, I want to talk to you. We're ready to start all over again. We'll start a new lap chart for the two of us. - I don't want to race you again dad. - You know what I mean on the same team, the way I always wanted it to be. Now what do you say? - We'll talk about it later. - Later? What do you mean later? - All right dad. Can I say something to you without hurting your feelings? I mean I think it's the reason we were always fighting with each other. - There's no point in digging up the past, like I said a new lap chart for the two of us. - Please dad, it's important! - All Right Rob. - You love racing don't you? Laguna Seca, Sebring, the Grand Prix? I know they're magic words to you. - It's my whole life. - Well that's the trouble dad. It isn't mine. I just don't fit into it. - What do you mean you don't fit in? I saw you drive today. With your talent you, a contract driver for the Seratti Company, the guy that just won at Milan? I tried to convince myself I wasn't proud of you for that. What do you mean you don't fit in? - I'm glad you were proud. - That's Seratti you drove in Europe, that's a good car isn't it? - None better. - Well I've got a real surprise for you. I want you to quit Seratti. - I was going to. - Good, because you're going to beat the world in the car that Greg and I have been building. You're gonna drive it next week in the Grand Prix. - You just don't understand do you dad? I've been trying to tell you I don't fit into it because I because I I hate racing! (tense orchestral music) I'm sorry. I'm glad you want me. Well do you have to be hurt? - Kids are supposed to love cars. I couldn't wait to give you one, to build them with you and you you hate them. It's just like hating me. - Why do you have take everything that way? Isn't it enough I tried? I tried so hard I don't know anything but cars. - I gave you everything. - You did it all for yourself. - I did it all for you. - Did you ever give me the right to be myself? - And what are you? - I guess I'm just somebody who hates you. (dramatic orchestral music) - Rob, what's wrong? What happened? - What always happens. It was like old home week. He rolled right over me. You know the way he does, the way that squeezes your guts out so you can't fight back. - But why Rob why? - He doesn't want to know me if I quit racing. He just doesn't want to know me. - All right Rob. It's his loss. - Mom I know I'm to blame for you and dad. - Stop it Rob. I don't want him this way and I can't change him either. Well it's over. - No it isn't. I'm not gonna let him off so easily. I'm gonna make him feel the way he makes me feel. I'm gonna hurt him. - He's already been hurt. All he has left are his cars. - What did he ever have? Cars were his whole life. - Well at least you can quit racing now. - No, no I can't. - What do you mean? - I'm gonna smash him the way he smashed me and it's gonna be where it hurts him most, on the track. - Well don't expect me to watch it. I never want to see you in a car again. (ominous orchestral music) - Can I help you? - Have you seen Rob Wilson? - Nothing but his picture, just gave him back his old place of honor today. Were you expecting him? - I'll wait for him. - Good, make yourself comfortable. They're running some old films of the Mille Miglia in there. - [Announcer] The line almost to a close, the drifters finish and line ahead and they are followed by a pair of Porsches, one of which finished fourth, a truly magnificent performance. And there goes the winner, number 6 Jaguar, Hawthorne tours back to the pit and the applause that is the winner's due. Now the trappings of victory, the bouquet, the champagne, the clicking of camera shutters, the applause of the milling crowd. To the drivers, Mike Hawthorne and Ira George are congratulated. His lap team too architects of victory and his team of mechanics, willing and hardworking.

A race furthermore, one of the all-time record speed of 130.87 miles an hour and as Mr. Thorpe's-- - Can I help you? - I think you've got something special. - Sorry, we can't mix that at the bar. - I'll take mine straight. - Coke on the rocks. - Old-fashioned. - Coke, old-fashioned, milk for the boy. - Make that cream. Bring me a double brandy and creme de coco when you get me an Alexander. - I'll bring you a safety belt. - (whistles) The kid's wild about me.

The strain, something got in the way, jolted me. - That must have been Tenyada spinning out. You sure were lucky in Milan. - Can't win them all. You noticed today? - What happened? - He isn't feeling well. - I think I know why. It kind of shocked me too, you and Liz. - Can I get you something? - Go away Liz. You've done enough. - You knew he existed. I never lied to you. - But he didn't have a name. He was just a shadow between us. - I'm sorry you discovered him this way. - He wants you back? - If I can prove myself to him. - I hope you fail Liz. - I may lose Greg if I care too much what happens to you, but I do care. - Why should you? - I don't know myself that well to give a simple answer. I just do. - So you care, so what should I do about it? - Give up trying to beat your father. - Uh uh. - Walk away. - No no. - Then do it fair. (swanky jazz music) - You'd stay with me till I do? (car engine roars) (car wheels screeching) (car engine roars) (car wheels screeching) (car engine roars) - It's going to beat the best in Europe. My boy can do it. - Greg? - Of course Greg. Where's the stopwatch? - I'll get it. - Dad, I didn't come down to meddle, but you just don't know what you've done. - No not you too, Joanie, now don't you turn against me. - I think you'd better know it. Rob is going to drive against you in the Grand Prix. He won't stop until he beats you. - He'll never catch us. - Try and understand, it's his way of beating you up. You made him so angry. - Then let him fight me like a man. - I'm sorry for both of you. (car engine roars) (dramatic orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (car engine roars) - 92.4 average that's pretty good. - Oh that's terrific. - Oh you pencil jockeys, you really designed a winner. - Looks like the Seratti. - 94.2. - I could feel it. - I don't like his being here. - Anybody can run a test track and anybody can leave. - How many screws in that mess? - Enough to beat any mousetrap sonny boy can put together. - Hello Greg. - Hello Liz. - Liz, I'd like you meet my father. - How do you do Mr. Wilson? - Hello there. (car engine roars) - What's its displacement? - Over 400 cubic inches. - What are you building, a race car or a tractor? Ever heard of a gear box? - Gear box my foot, those phony plans the Europeans put in have to have an auxiliary to run the gear box, what do you got? Five horsepower and 35 space forward? - The great American racing car, Harry Wilson's dream of glory. Suppose we see if this is it right now? Scared? - Okay Greg. - Back off Harry. Kit and I didn't build the 110 for you and Rob to club each other with. - [Harry] You built it for me. - Just change his name to Rob and I'll even let him use my toothbrush. - I built the 110 with your tools and your money. You give me more than I can ask for, more than I can take. - Drive the 110 for me. - I'll drive it at the Grand Prix. - It's now or never. - You drive it yourself Harry. - Kip you wanted to drive? - Come on Leadfoot, you can choke on my exhaust. - No. - No punk's gonna beat up an old man in front of me. - Look I'll drive. - My turn remember? (car engine roars) - Don't feel too bad Greg. Liz will you keep company for a while till I get back. (dramatic orchestral music) (car engine roars) (car engine roars) (dramatic orchestral music) (car engine roars) (wheels screeching) (car engine roars) (dramatic orchestral music) (car wheels screeching) (dramatic orchestral music) - Hey you all right? - I'm sorry. - What do you mean you're sorry? - I mean it I'm sorry. (punch rings out) - Some day you're gonna run into somebody you can't move. Back down boy. You're gonna run head on into your grave. - Stop it Kit. (tense orchestral music) - Liz? - Liz, help him. - Face it Joanie, he's sick. He should go where he can't hurt anybody. (car engine roars) - She wasn't driving. She didn't deserve that. - Well tell her she was wrong and give her your shoulder. She'll need it. (car engine rumbling) Those are expensive noises. Kit pulled a rear end when he spun out. I think he tore the drive shaft off at the rear supply. - You designed this shaft for a lot more torque. - Not enough for that kind of a spin out, too much strain for that type of a spline. - Will you fix it for me Greg? - I'm in this to make a name for myself Harry. Do I drive in the Grand Prix tomorrow? (tender orchestral music) (machinery humming) Let's change from a 10 to a 16 spline. - And relocate the radius arms in a wider position, so it'll take a little more lateral stress that way. - Yeah, get me the bar stock. It's the closest we've got. I'll turn on the lathe and we can nail cut that new splines in the oven. - Yeah. - A little sugar doctor? - Three scoops to celebrate this momentous occasion. Little lady, we have just given birth to a well-splined chassis. - How is the father doing? - You mistake me madam. I'm just a poor relation. Greg smokes and paces the floor in the anteroom, relocating his radius arms to receive his child. - Thanks for helping me today Kit. - I've waited a long time for you to let me help you Joanie. You remember in the ninth grade when I had to learn that love poem and I couldn't, you helped me. - I remember. - You know you were the only girl in the ninth grade that I ever said it to, did I ever tell you that? - No, because you recited it to Betsy Wentworth in the locker room. I caught you doing it and I cried. - Hey that was only a passing thing with her, you know a fling, a whim. - If you say so Kit. (machinery humming) - Thanks guys, you were terrific. - Yeah, but will it work? - Funny boy that is what makes racers. - Wash up everybody tonight I'm buying. - Hey. - Whoa ho ho. - Woo hoo hoo hoo. (swanky jazz music) - Yeah. (swanky jazz music) - Is there a house limit on this guy? - Yeah, let him enjoy himself. He just lost his good standing here. (swanky jazz music) - Hit me. - In your face? - Hit me, come on, hit me, it won't hurt. - Haven't you had enough already? - You see those loving cups? Fill them all up. - Why don't you just lie under the tap? - I'd struggle with the vessel my lady. - I'm sure you will. (swanky jazz music) - Do me a favor honey. Put another quarter. - Can't make it on your own power? - Nobody plays music the way you do baby. - I'll see what's left, more jazz? - No no what I want now is something with heart. You know the one that I mean. (swanky jazz music) Well hello good friends and relations. - If you'll excuse us everybody, I think we'll be on our way. - No sit down, sit down. - Get out of the way Rob. - Sit down. I was just looking for something I lost. (laughs) Oh there it is. It's my father. You are my father aren't you? - You're not being funny Rob. - I lost you too didn't I Liz? Shh, shh. (laughs) That was our song don't you remember? Only you never listened. - Go home Rob, sleep it off. - Come on dad. - Go on, you go on ahead. (down tempo romantic music) - Where did everybody go? What's the matter? This guy bothering you? - He's what's left of my son. - Well you just bought them five more drinks. - Buying me anymore? - You've already cost me my home and my wife. - Money, love and what else is there, power? - You wanted to quit racing. You wanted me to like the idea. Well I'm telling you right now, I like it. - Uh uh, one more race, got one more race in me. - You'll never beat me. (glass shatters) (down tempo romantic music) (sultry romantic music) (car wheels screeching) - Liz, Liz! - Be quiet Rob, it's late. People are asleep. - I'm sorry if I woke you up, I just had to see you. - It's late Rob, you can see me tomorrow. - Well what's the matter, is your sister's family back? - No. - Well can't I come in? - What's the matter Rob? You're shaking all over. - Liz, Liz, I need your help. I don't know. I've never felt like this before, like I'm falling I'm falling. I'm scared Liz. - Call a doctor Rob. He'll give you something to calm you down. - I need somebody to hold onto. - Let go, Rob, let go. Get ahold of yourself. - Get out of here Rob. - You lousy tramp! (punch rings out) (grunts) - Stop it, stop! He can't help himself. - Why not? - Help yourself, you get a psychiatrist. - Nothing's wrong with me. - Why do you have to lean on Liz or beat Harry? - Shut up, I'm warning you. - When something gets in your craw like today all you know how to do is lead foot a big piece of machinery at it. - You're asking for it Morgan, you and my old man. Tomorrow, tomorrow you'll remember. I won't just push you, I'll spin you out. I'll be gunning for you from the second you get behind that wheel. I'll kill you Morgan. - I just hope you wake up in time. 300 horses under your foot won't change me or Harry or the world. You better find out it's the horsepower inside a man that really counts. (car engine roars) (car wheels screeching) He better back down. - No, he'll mean it tomorrow too. - I'll have to chance that. - Why? - You know where I came from Liz. Nothing came easy. I had to start a car together in a rotten garage when Rob was tooling up and down the streets in Harry's custom jobs. You yourself left me for the things I couldn't buy. Everything I've been working for depends on whether I race tomorrow. (tender orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music) (crowd roaring) - [Announcer] This is it folks, the American Grand Prix, 70,000 people here at Riverside, California. They're waiting for the big one, the best cars from all over the worlds, the Scarabs, Maseratis, Mercedes and Ferraris, a big turnout also on those Jags and hopes are high that an American car can walk off with top honors. Among them, the Harry Wilson number 110 special, then the European favorite, the Seratti number 111. The best drivers in the world are here, Phil Hill and Richie Ginther with a 4.5 liter Ferrari. This is the first time a race of such significance has been run in the United States. - Change your mind mom? - No. - I thought you said you weren't gonna watch me race again. - I won't. - What's that supposed to mean? - You're not in the race. I'm pulling the Seratti out. - I won't let you. - I own the car. It's my distributing company. - But I made you a promise. This is my last race. I came back from Europe for you. I did everything you asked. I kept my word. - All right Rob, I won't force you out. But I beg you-- - Oh please Rob. - Believe me, I'll never race again. - I can't protect you anymore. Every adult has to decide what he really wants. I've made my choice, good luck with yours. (tense orchestral music) - I have to talk to you Greg. - You weren't supposed to be here today Liz. I didn't want you to come. - I couldn't let you go through with it Greg. I had to tell Harry. - You better get out of there. - I'm not sorry Greg. - Both you and Kit checked out the qualifying win. Kit's gonna drive this race. - No! - Greg, Rob threatened you, not Kit. - Look it's my race, I'll take my chances. - You're out Greg. I'll give you the black flag. You'll be disqualified. - Wish me luck. - [Announcer] All drivers to the starting line for the main event. - Okay now look, you'll be in the front position. Rob's back in the pack. Move out as fast as you can and stay out in front. - I got you. - [Announcer] It's a tremendous spectacle. The roar is deafening here at the start of the Grand Prix. (car engines roaring) And heading into turn number one, the left turn as they go away from the starting line, everybody off to a good rolling start. Nobody particularly making a move except Rob Wilson in number 111, beginning to work his way up through the traffic. He started well back in the pack, coming through the S turn for the first time making a full turn to the lead, Wilson is very happy. Out of that in turn number six, everybody rolling well. And number 110 one of the American favorites (car engines drown out voice) now they back off a little bit on turn number seven. That could be a really dangerous one, but they all go through it very well on this first trip around the track. A short straightaway for most of them and then into turn number eight. Once again on the American specials making good moves here. (car engines drown out voice) From turn number eight into the 180 degree turn number nine. (car engines roaring) And they will have completed the first lap of the American Grand Prix. (car engines roaring) Again into turn number one. (car engines roaring) Heading now for those S turns. Of course the cars have backed off, but here's the number 110 begin to maneuver even though they're in these dangerous S turns. Car number 110 beginning to move up. (car engines roaring) Rob Wilson is number 111, but he is well back in the pack again. (car engines roaring) The 110 moving up to the front and here they come at turn number two. (car engines drown out voice) Here comes Rob Wilson's Seratti, look out, there's Cooper spinning off the track, spinning but not madly. On the straight between seven and eight, Rob Wilson passing moving up last and into second position. Rob Wilson coming up behind number 110, Greg Morgan driving car number 110. - We've got to flag Kit off the track. - No. - You knew Rob would think he's me. - I can't give him the black flag. - Signal him to make a pit stop. - No. - Maybe you're willing to risk my brother's life for your lousy dreams, but I'm not. You know Rob didn't kill Billy Johnson, you did! (car engines roaring) - [Announcer] On some of these turns, they're bunching up, two and three abreast as they head into the turns (car engines roaring drown out voice) past the judge's stand once again, Rob Wilson and Greg Morgan (car engines roaring drown out voice). Rob Wilson approaches now. Wilson's worked his way from almost the very last draw at the start, doing a great driving job, a tremendous duel between three great drivers developing here as they battle it out lap after lap in this main event, but a long way to go yet. - I'm sorry Alice. It's all my fault. - Whatever we did to Rob Harry, he'll have to undo it himself. - I'll find some way to make it up to you. - [Announcer] Rob Wilson car number 111, pulling up behind number 110 driven by Greg Morgan. Morgan is pretty hard to catch. Wilson is trying everything to get by him. He's pushing him to beat the plan. They're hubcap to hubcap as they head into one of these turns. Looks like they may have too much speed. That turns gets Wilson and (wheels screeching drowns out voice) to Wilson but he appears to be all right. Coming back on the track and I don't think he lost very much on the leader Greg Morgan in car number 110. (car engines roaring) (car wheels screeching) He makes for that long straightaway, a chance to really put their foot in it and Rob Wilson is working his way up through the traffic. He's on his way to catch up with number 110, driven by Greg Morgan and he has caught up with him again and now they're hitting the straightaway, Wilson running hubcap to hubcap. Look out, there's trouble there. It think Morgan may be going too fast and he almost lost the road on that one, but he is back on the track. He's all right. He looked for a moment like he was really out of it, but he's slowed down through now he's headed into the turn. He'll be making his chance. (car engines roaring) - Kit! (car engines roaring) - [Announcer] He's lost a lot of important distance and Rob Wilson has moved away from him now. And there's smoke coming from number 110. Something wrong with-- - Come on Kit, bring it in. - Car number 110 out on the track there. - Bring it baby. - [Announcer] And he's gotta bring that into the pits, gotta get it in under his own power or he'll be disqualified because no repairs are allowed on the track, he's gotta bring it in. (car engines roaring) - Close the fuel line. All right got it. All right, I'll drive. Where's the helmet? (car engine roars) - [Announcer] I think they're gonna get 110 back in the race. It looks like they're gonna be able to resume the race. - Kit. - It's okay Joanie. - [Announcer] Yes, 110 is gonna get back on that track, but he's gonna be almost a lap behind the leader. 110 entering the track again. (car engines roaring) He's got a long way to go to Rob Wilson. The road is spread out, he makes his way through some of these slower cars in a hurry. (car engines roaring) There's oil on the track on turn number seven, 73 back behind Haywell, car number 85. There they go, car number 85 turning and car 73 spinning out. That forces Greg Morgan to slow down again. (car engines roaring drown out voice) They're gonna get through I think all right. Number two is gonna take it also. Once again car number 16 taking him back two laps. There goes another top contender falling far behind in this grueling 50 lap race. (car engines roaring) (dramatic orchestral music) (car engines roaring) We're more than halfway through this race, Rob Wilson out in front in his number 111, with the rest of the pack close behind him. (car engines roaring) And Greg Morgan in car number 110 beginning to work his way up towards the leaders. He's pulling up on the third, fourth and fifth place car. (car engines roaring) (dramatic orchestral music) Greg Morgan driving a great race, making a great comeback after having first a spin out and then engine trouble and he's moving up on the fourth, third and second place cars. He might be able to do it, but he's got a long way to go to catch up with Rob Wilson. (dramatic orchestral music) (car engines roaring) We've got an incredible race here. (car engines roaring) Greg Morgan coming up on the second place car. He is moving past him and he is in second place. Greg Morgan takes over second place, but he is a long way behind Rob Wilson the leader in car number 111, tremendous comeback by Greg Morgan. He's putting everything he can into that car. Wow, he may have a chance to catch up with Rob Wilson. Rob Wilson, a great driver holding that lead, Morgan pulling on down. (dramatic orchestral music) Only a lap ago, Greg Morgan catching up with Rob Wilson, the rest of the pack far behind them and Morgan in number 110 pulls up. He's right behind Wilson, almost beside him. Can't get by, he's got plenty of power on that car, but Wilson has the more maneuverable car. He'll make it tough and now Morgan does cut into the lead. Greg Morgan taking off the lead here for the moment at least here toward Rob Wilson. (dramatic orchestral music) Here we go on the last lap with Greg Morgan driving up a fantastic race here today leading Rob Wilson after a sensational 45 lap comeback. And now the American contender is out in front and Rob Wilson pushes his car's lead foot once more down the street to turn number seven. (dramatic orchestral music) (car engines roaring) - [Rob] You're asking for it Morgan, you and my old man and it's gonna be where it hurts most, on the track. (dramatic orchestral music) (car engines roaring) - [Kit] Back down boy. You're gonna run head on into your grave. - [Rob] I hate racing. - [Harry] It's my whole life. It's just like hating me. Kids are supposed to love cars. I gave you everything. - [Rob] Did you ever give me the right to be myself? - [Harry] And what are you? And what are you? - [Rob] I'll never race again. - [Greg] He's sick he should go where he can't hurt anybody. - [Harry] He's what's left of my son. - [Rob] You are my father, aren't you? - [Harry] You'll never beat me. You'll never beat me. - [Rob] I need somebody to hold onto. - [Liz] Let go Rob, let go. - [Greg] You want to help yourself, you get a psychiatrist. - [Rob] I'll kill you Morgan. - [Greg] I just hope you wake up in time. I just hope you wake up in time. I just hope you wake up in time. (dramatic orchestral music) (car wheels screeching) - [Announcer] Wait until the track is clear before getting a report. Here comes Greg Morgan in the win. All right please everybody keep the track clear. Cars are still on the track. - Get him out. Get him out. - We're taking you home son. (sad orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music)
