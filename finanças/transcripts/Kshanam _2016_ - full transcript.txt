Maybe if you are listening to this message... can you call me? My number is 9949012233... Bye, Rishi... Hello.. Why are you going to India? I am going to a wedding in Hema chechi's family. She has invited me Did they call you? Do you know Hema's full name? All this.. for that girl? I don't know. - Don't you know? Or are you hiding from me? - Mom! - She said that she needs to see me. That's all I know. - What will you say to father? What is Hema's full name? Hey Shweta! Shweta! What? I got Rishi's number. - Rishi?.. - I got it from the professor's laptop. - Rishi is that NRI guy? - Yeah... that's him. Look, there he is. Nice guy apart from that ego in his looks OK Hey, what are you doing? It doesn't matter. - Hello! - Hello Rishi! Who's this? I'll tell you who I am, but tell me... how are you? Who's this? - Won't you talk to me without knowing me? - Why am I talking to someone I don't know? You look so handsome. What is the secret? A Subway sandwich? Are you following me? No, don't use such big words. So, how many girls have asked you out? - Including you two? - what? I can hear you both laughing. Oy... What? Just because you are from America.. If you act smart girls won't fall for you. You're lucky... we're on the phone. You don't know me Boys will be afraid to stand in front of me. Is your face that bad? Who do you think you are? Run! Hey! Dad, meet the principal today. Why is he coming to me? Damn, God God God God.. Dad, I think you will be late for the bank meeting. Can't you meet the principal tomorrow? Work pressure will always be there, but your education is important now. I met a young investor named Karthik. Hi! - Father, this is Pooja's friend.. - I like you, not Pooja. There are always 3 reasons to like a girl. First, mental.. What? I don't mean crazy. It is intelligence. When we watch a movie, most of the girls talk about the heroine's clothes You talked about acting. Nice. - So you too were in that theater...? - Second. Feeling... Your heart... I have been following you for 2 weeks. Wherever you go, that friend Pooja will be with you. You will spend money on her things too. You have money and she doesn't. Very nice. Look.. - The third is physical. - What? I like your smile. I liked the expression of fear and anger on your face right now - Very very nice. - But I didn't like you. Then you are her father. Uncle, please remember this face. You will have to see it from time to time. By the way, I am Rishi. - Me too 3 things... - Shh... silence. I also have 3 things I don't like about you. One. I didn't like that you put me under pressure when I was with my father Two. You gave Shakehand for someting my father said in anger. I did not like your arrogance. Three This is very important. You followed me for 2 weeks without my knowledge. I didn't like stalking. But I liked only one thing. Boys don't dare to talk to me because of my anger But you did. That too in front of my father. I also like your honesty. Don't act like a psycho or sadist just because you got my number. I'm carrying pepper spray. By the way, I am Shweta. This is my favorite place. My mother used to bring me here when I was young. No one else knows this place except you. I love you. If I say the same, will you ever forget me? Shweta, my love has no conditions. But there are conditions in relationships. Love is... a promsie. A promise that I will be always there fro you Whatever happens, No matter what When I was young, I used to say I love you to my mother That mother is no more When I was 17, I told a boy I loved him. He chased my best friend and kissed him OK! Then tell me you hate me... It may be right between us. Rishi, I really don't know what love is. What is it? If we can define it, then it is not love, Shweta.. You have to feel it. Even though your mother is gone... don't you love for her exists? - Hi, reservation for Rishi - Sure, sir. Hema.. Yeah. I just checked in. Excuse me. Excuse me. Boss, he is calling you. - Is this car for rent? - Hello sir Do your work Chotoo, bring us tea. I need Sir's ID. - ID? - Yes PAN Card, Aadhaar... Passport? Chhotoo, bring something cold instead of tea. It will be ₹8000. ₹10000 including diesel, pollution and traffic. Boss, I asked about the car Are you trying to sell me aeroplane looking at my passport? Chotu, I have enough tea. Chotu, cover it and put it back in the fridge. You caught me. Only 2000 rupees. - I am Babu Khan. Kala(means black) - Kala? Yes Kala - Nice to meet you - Babu Khan Kala, Let's go then. Come and sit, Saab. Don't think anything bad about me. 2000 ₹ only. But... Bye sir... Chotu, bring me that.. Hi! Hi Rishi! Sit! How are you? - What's all this? - It's... Shweta... Hey... Are you... Are you OK? What about the doctor? I dropped out of medicine that day. Now I am just a typical NRI. I have my own investment firm. You were born and brought up there, so how come you're typical? Hm... Correct... So marriage and family? Marriage... Family... Father, mother and 2 friends. So, what about you? Any kids? A daughter, Riya Good good good! Happy family.. eh..? Shweta.. Did it took you so long to remember me? What's so important that you cant talk on the phone? I need your help. What? It was Riya's first day at school... We were about an hour late. It was Riya's first day without me. She did not want to go. I finally got her to agree. - Let's go.. - Um. Riya, are you scared because you don't know anyone there? You will have many friends in school. This is your first day. Don't worry! You can play with everyone.. Let everyone say that Riya is a good girl. OK right? Are you afraid? - Do you want to take Sammy Bear with you? - OK It is in the back seat, go and get it.. Hello! My life changed in an instant. Rishi, they kidanapped my daughter... Rishi. Can you help me find my daughter? Please Rishi.. I need your help. Shweta, I left India because of you. Now I am back because of you. Should I feel angry that she dumped me? Who is going to kidnap your daughter and why? I can't even imagine how hard it is for you Day by day I lost hope of getting Riya back. No one responds, no proof for anything. No one helps. I couldn't take it. Then one day I remembered what you said. A promise that I'll always be there for you. Whatever happens. No matter what. Rishi, our love was everything to me. But now it's just a memory. Those words you said that day, give me hope. I still believe your words. That is why I sought your help. I need help to find Riya. I'm not asking you this out of my selfishness, but of desperation. I've been running around like a crazy person for 2 months I asked my friend, locals, neighbours, everyone. Don't you know my Riya? Did you see her? - I don't know madam, - I don't know. I haven't seen any child. I also spoke to the police. I know how many times I went to the police station. Didn't you get any single information? How many times do I have to tell you.? You spoke to ACP right? Karthik also does not know what to do. Kartik, I'm asking you. Where is Riya? Nobody is able to bring her back Rishi, I don't even know whom to ask. Police investigation... One day they call me and told me that they are stopping the investigation. Like they were done. My senior has completed this investigation. Sign it. What? How does the search end without finding the child? Ha, madam, how is your health? Did you find anything? Will let you know if found. Just want to know if you got any new information. Case is closed madam. Are you saying we have to create clues out of nothing? Excuse Me Why are talking so carelessly? She just lost her daughter. Hello, who are you? - Friend - What do you mean by friend? Family friend Look, madam. It is not good to tell your friends and family to get into our nerves Can we make your daughter out of thin air? What are you saying? This is your job! Hello, tell me Sreenu. Hey! Who told you to look at the file without permission? - Hey! - Yes sir. - Take this file and leave it in the store room. - Okay sir. Look boss. You mind your own business, we'll take care of ours - Sir, Ma'am is calling - I'm coming Even if the whole world forgets Riya, I can't She is my daughter! - Do you have a photo of Riya? - Um. Here it is! Do you both had a fight with someone? With friends? With family members? etc. Business problems? Money problems? Nothing big like that. No one has even demanded a ransom so far. Kartik? He is completely addicted to work. No emotion comes out of him. Shall I speak to Karthik? Karthik doesn't know you. I haven't told him about you yet. Can the attackers be recognized by sight? They wore masks, Rishi. Before I can see anything, I was unconscious - So what will I do next? - If I had known what I should do, I would have done it. I wouldn't have asked you. What are you saying? All these years no calls and no messages She married someone and left. Why do you bother if someone's daughter is kidanpped? It is Shweta. Not someone. Listen Rishi. You are not superman. You are saying that someone kidanapped her daughter You are saying somebody assaulted Shweta. What if they attack you tomorrow or kill you? You are involved in something you know nothing about. - Think about her situation. - Why should I think? Did she think about you? Has she ever thought of you in the last four years? - That's not.... - Don't say anything more. If you don't catch the flight and come back to the US, I will tell your father. I will call within an hour of booking the ticket. You're coming back, that's it. Sir.. - Your passport - Oh yeah. - Sir - Thank you sir. Babu Khan... Here is your car key. - What's up sir? You are going back? Yeah. Just a moment. - Here's your money. - Oh no - Thanks - Thank you sir. Sir, Come. I will drop you at the airport. NO. It's OK. No problem sir, I have a job in Shamzabad. I will leave. Come on sir. What's up, sir? Your face is very pale. Any money issue? It's a women issue, right? I can tell Speak your mind, Sir. My heart says one thing. But the mind says something else. The heart is right, Sir. It won't harm. - Listen Rishi, you are not superman. - I need your help, Rishi. - Has she ever thought of you in the last four years? - I need help to find Riya A promise that I will always be there for you. Whatever happens BabuKhan, turn the car. Sir? Take me back to the hotel. Quickly. OK sir. Hello Anil! I am not coming to US. I can't leave her like this. I have promised. I have to keep it. You can say whatever to my father We wish for one thing but destiny takes us somewhere else. No one knows what will happen. Or why... She wanted to see me and that's why I came to India. Now she has asked me to find a small child in such a big country. I will find her. Life can change in a... "Moment" - Hi. - Yes - I need to meet the principal please. - One second - Your name sir? - Tell me, Rishi. A little girl was kidnapped 2 months ago here? She was your student. Kidnapped? When? On June 11. They attacked the child's mother outside the school and kidnapped the child. No. Nothing of that sort happened. How is that possible? My friend told me that it happened. Even the police investigation was done. How can you say that it didn't happened? This was right outside the school. Nothing like that happened in our school. Someone may have given you wrong information. Why are you asking me about all this? Who are you? That... I have come to enroll my son in this school. - Someone said that it happened. - Will be rumours. I guarantee the safety of your child. There is nothing to worry. How can you say not to worry? They kidnapped her. She's missing. This is the girl. Her name is Riya. I think you came to the wrong school. She is not a kid from our school anyway. Beautiful girl. Was this girl really kidanpped? - Hello. - Excuse me, Excuse me. 2 months ago, a child was kidnapped in front of that school. Do you know anything about it? Who are you? - I have come to enroll my son in that school. - Are you police? - Security... - Sir - Deal with him. Excuse Me. I'm talking to you. - Hey... get lost...! - Sir please go. please sir.. I will reach India in 3 days. If you need anything, just ask Bobby. Ok Karthik. What's that sound?, Where are you? I am on the balcony. Just wanted some fresh air.. Shweta, how many times have I told you not to go out? - Karthik please.. - Do you want to exhibit yourself to everyone? Shweta go inside now.! Rishi that… Shweta, I went to school and asked the principal. They don't even know Riya. Not even enrolled in school. None of them have even met Riya yet. If you have a child, would you take the child to the school where there was a kidnap? Are you saying they hid the truth so their parents wouldn't be afraid? They lie so that their business does not stop. Shweta, do you have any other photos of Riya? - Not anymore. - From anywhere. Facebook, Phone like that? Even Friends were a luxury.. Forget Facebook.. Karthik didn't like it. If I ask, he will say that you have me, then why you need Facebook? Shweta, I asked about the photos. I don't have it now Rishi.. Not even a single photo at home? - Bobby is coming Rishi.. - Bobby? - Please go. You need to go. Please... Go. - Not that, Shruti... Bobby is Karthik's brother. Things will get worse if he see you. Please go, please. Who's inside? Brother said to keep an eye on you. Went to a rave party last night and a Russian guy there gave me MDMA. It just blew my mind I was tripping till 4 o'clock It was too much fun. - You want to try? - Shall I call Karthik? For what? He doesn't like all this Sorry sorry sorry Bobby, Get out! Please Get the hell out of here now Go.. Sorry, sorry Bobby, leave now. Hey, don't tell brother. Am I like a brother to you? Right? Whenever Kartik goes abroad, he sends his younger brother to watch me. Who will save me from his brother? Shweta, I need Bobby's phone number and address. Don't be afraid. I came here to solve problems, not to create them. Excuse me. Do you know Shweta and her husband Karthik? - 15th floor? - Yeah. When was the last time you saw their daughter? Do they have a daughter? I don't know, there is only one apartment on each floor here. So most of us don't know each other. OK thanks Oh, and who are you? Where were we? - Hello. - Bobby? Yeah. Two months back, your brother's dauhter was kidnapped, right? Hey who are you? Police? I am a reporter from Times of India. - Sister - Rishi, the function is at 8 o'clock, you remember, Right? Where? Where do you stay? Rishi - Rishi.. - Marriott Hotel. Oh, how is it? Good, comfortable. Sis, Wasn't there a kidnap of a little girl at Jubilee Hills 2 months ago? - Do you know anything about it? - Which kidnap? A little girl just outside the school. I don't know There are always 100 such things on TV. I don't know where India is going He lived in India for only 3 years. He was studying medicine at that time. He didnt come here then. He haven't even met us. He came to hyderbad now only because I called him He was very small when he was a child. Aren't all children small? So Rishi, why did you quit MBBS Medicine and go back to America? Hello. Where are you? Will you come back? Idiot, I'm going to America to tell mom and dad about you. Shweta. I love you. You won't say it back, will you? Dad is on the phone. Come on let's go. Shweta, tell me... Let's go Why did you came here? Shweta, go inside. Shweta, please stay. - We are in love sir. - Didn't I already say that I don't like you? Don't you understand? Listen to me Rishi. You are not a bad person. But you don't belong here. You have no culture. It's OK for you to talk about my daughter's physique infront of me But not for me. It's OK for you to hold my daughter's hand in front of me. But not for me You were born and raised in America. You don't know our culture. Your mother and father must not have taught you that. The problem is not my values. It's in your thoughts. I don't think it's wrong to openly say that I like her laugh or dislike her anger. I don't think it's wrong to talk about feelings of the mind. In particular, I dont think loving is wrong. You know I held her hand. But you don't know how much courage she gets when I'm around.. She got courage because I held her hand. I can live without Shweta and Shweta can live without me. But we will not be happy. Sir please Don't stop us. Shweta's wedding has been already decided. I was about to inform her. But I have made my decision. The groom's background is not as good as your's, Rishi. He has no parents even. But he is a self made man. He even helps me from time to time. Shweta's wedding has been decided! Now leave Will you marry me? Think about it. Rishi This is my mother's wedding dress. So your father? He will understand I love you Da, decided where the honeymoon is? Not yet decided. Is Shweta pregnant? - Dei - I was wondering why you are getting married so soon It's fine. - Are you ready - Ah.. Come.. - Rishi.. - Um You said something earlier... ...about mother and love. I'm feeling it now. I hate you Arey... What is the problem? Couldn't find a Auspicious Time in the next 2 days. We are getting married in the temple in front of the God. Why is today not a good day, then? OK then. Shweta, phone... hello What happened? Shweta .... Hey Shweta.. You stay here. Do not cut the call. I want to listen to the doctor. OK. Dad... Stage 4 dear... They always knew something was wrong. Now they know... They say that it would have been better if it had been discovered 6 months earlier. Shweta What is all this? -Hello - Hello where are you? I'm coming, sister. Sis,... Sis. Excuse me, You dropped your wallet. Excuse Me. - I want to talk to you. - Sir, you? - Two months ago...... - Sir, aren't you the one who spoke with boss yesterday? What do you know about the kidnapping that happened in front of the school two months ago? I don't know sir. Is there a footage of it? Put it at 8.30. Why did the video skip? Video is missing from 8.30 to 11.40? What happened in those 3 hours? The kidnapping took place at that time. I don't know sir, one day some policemen came. The boss got scared. I was told to go. I don't know what happened after that. How can I get that video? - Boss.... He won't say. - You can tell me. Video backup is done every month. It's in the boss's office. If I go there without permission, my job will go sir. - Difficult sir. - I want that video. How much do you want? Sir, Are you really police? What? Police only take bribes. They don't give brirbes. - Video? - Sir give me the number. I will try my best. Do you have the video from the day before? Bobby Hello Rishi. Did they take Bobby's statement during the police investigation? I think they talked to everyone. I want Bobby's statement. Can you go and see if they have one? What's up Rishi? Right now I have only questions. I will let you know when I get answers Shweta. Trust me - Hello sir. - Hmm. - Hi.Hi - I'm Ganesh Hi Ganesh. - How is Hyderabad, sir? - So far so good. It's a new place right? It takes time to get used to it. Sir this is Srinivasa Reddy, your assistant. - Reddy.. - Hello sir - What does everyone say about me, Reddy? - Nothing much, you're new. What do they say about me? It's... Reddy, he is new, he is a comedian, wouldn't you say all that? Heard you're a little different. Different? Who said that? Who? Give me their phone number. I want to see him. Show me, Reddy. Reddy, show me. Sir, ACP wants to meet you. Hey, why are you crying shamelessly? And what is this stomach? Go jogging. - Run.. - Ok sir. You stay here.

Go and tell them bro... Go & tell.. Bobby and his friends will deliver drugs to me.. I will get 10 percent commission on everything sold. From Mehdi town to Madhapur we are bribing the police. Been doing it for years. Everyone is my friend. Nothing happens in the city without the knowledge of the police. You are a good person, please don't interfere. Why are you threatening me? If the police threaten us, we will pay bribe. If strangers do it.. understood? So keep your distance. I did not come here to threaten you, Babukhan. I have something to ask you. Hey, hey, stop, stop. hey Why are you following us? He is following me, not you. He is following me, not you. Why? How do I know? Why did you engage with them? What? I put a Facebook pic. He didn't like that. He came looking for me. He is my food brother You're Black and I'm Black. Aren't we all born from the same mother? Aren't we brothers also.. OK? Stop following us or you're dead OK. - Be warned - OK you fools Bye Go, same color, aren't we all brothers? Hey America You look like a chocolate boy. I just showed you the gun.

Have you seen this girl anywhere? She was kidnapped. Why are you wasting your time thinking about this? Go and relax. Babukhan! You are worried about me eventhough our relation is only 2 days old.

Can you come to my office? Hello sir, what are you doing? Hey, Don't you have eyes? Hey, get a towel. Is he Vasant Khanna? Vasant Khanna Lucknow Police. Black shirt, blue jeans. That's him Why is the Lucknow police officer looking for a little girl in Hyderabad? He is a policeman. We must be careful. Vasanth Khanna Sub Inspector of Police. Lucknow Division How do you know Telugu? I grew up in Vaisakh as a child. Your commissioner was my senior in college. Jai Singh Mehra Do you know him? Yes Let me call him. Hey, sir Kartik! What's up? Has it been a while? Everything is ok. Just a casual call. - How's your family? - Everything is good. Good good By the way Do you know a Vasant Khanna? Vasant Khanna? Hazardganj Police Station Oh Vasanth, He is on leave. He has gone to Hyderabad for a wedding. OK. Do you want to talk to him? Oh Yes. Why not. - Hello - Sir, You have minister's call. Listen Kartik, I will talk to you later. He said he is busy and disconnected. How do you know Shweta? I met her at a restaurant and she said that Riya is missing. So I offered help. Are you the one who spoke to Srinivasan in our apartment? Shweta says she did not get any information. I thought I would get some information if I asked the neighbors. As soon as I came to know about the advertisement in the newspaper, I came to India, Mr. Khanna. I don't know how to tell you this - We don't have a baby. - What?!! We don't have a daughter. 2 months back, June 11th morning Shweta was driving the car when I called her. She stopped the car and was talking to me when suddenly she was attacked. She was brutally attacked for her car. She was in coma for 7 days. In fact I remember telling her early that morning We felt it would be good to have children She wanted a boy and I wanted a girl I think that got stuck in her mind. As soon as she woke up from the coma, She was asking where is her daughter, where is her daughter. I thought it was her imagination. But the doctor said it was because of the trauma. I don't know who Riya is. We don't have a daughter. Please open the door. We have no children. - We have a daughter, Karthik - Please Shweta Initially, the police suspected me. It took around a month for the truth to come out. They realized that they were going after something that was not true. Do you want me to get proofs from thin air? Last week she showed a photo of a child and said this is our daughter. Mr. Khanna. We have to believe what we see with our own eyes. But in the end. We believe what we like. Even if it's not true We don't have a daughter, Vasanth. Are you saying we should make up the information? Did she made all this up? Like she made this all up out of thin air? You have talked to her, what do you think? Does she seem normal? Please go. you need to go. Health all OK now? Mr. Khanna. Don't make my life difficult by advertising in newspaper. Please - Hello - Hello sir, this is the security at the house opposite the school. I got that video. If you come quickly, you can watch it.. There is no photo of Riya anywhere.!! Why not even at home or on the phone or Facebook? You asked me to leave When I asked who is Bobby. When the ad was placed in the newspaper, you panicked. When I asked about Kartik's thoughts, you changed the subject. Realizing what you said was wrong, the police stopped investigation. No one has seen your daughter. Principal didnt saw your daughter. Karthik says there is no such person. Even in the CCTV video I watched, your child is not there. She was hiding in the back seat. I have seen it with my own eyes. She was totally scared. They attacked you not for your child but for the car. There is no Riya. Please believe me, Rishi. How to believe, Shweta? You showed me a photo of a child and said it was your daughter. Another person saw the photo and said it was his daughter. He even showed proof. What to believe? Rishi, They are all lying. Did you tell me the truth? Why didn't you go to the police station to investigate Bobby's statement? I went. I went But none of them believe that I have a daughter. No one, not even Karthik. Why didn't you tell me this truth?? I was scared. I called you after 4 years. No one believes I have daughter. Everyone is saying that my mental state is wrong. I was afraid that you would not believe me because of that Shweta, stop. - Rishi... - Please Close your eyes and think for a moment Whether there is a child. Please. I have a daughter. You don't believe me? Leave me alone - Shweta - Leave me alone, please Is there actually a child? Rishi, I thought you would at least believe me. Shweta, what is this mark? Shweta! Shweta Hi, Rishi. I need your help, Rishi. You still don't believe me? - Is this him? - Yes sir Look bro... I'm a bit hot-tempered. Violent too. If you don't cooperate with me, you will get beaten.

A young woman fell to her death from the 15th floor of a building. All the residents are shocked by the incident. Police are carefully investigating whether it was a murder or a suicide. The police were also surprised to hear what the woman's husband said. He said that the woman had been suffering from depression and mental problems for some time. Did Karthik lie? Why? Hello sir - Babu Khan, I will give the money tomorrow. - May I come inside? - Speak - I am a person who prays 5 times. God does not forgive if we do wrong. I have done many things for money. Sold drugs, dadagiri. But till today no one has died because of my work. I never thought that someone would die because I hid the truth. Why are you telling me all this?? If only I had told the truth the day you showed me the photo... Shweta madam would still be alive. Hey, how do you know Shweta? I know not only them but many others. I swear on Allah. I won't hide anything anymore. Sir, I have seen that girl. I saw that girl. Bobby Bhai... - It should be delivered to Mehdi town - Ok bhai Your money - What do you want us to do with the girl? - I asked you to come at 2 o'clock. You're early. Go! Take her inside. Then I saw her sir. Bobby, that... that girl... If you tell someone... Poor Shweta madam went to the police station several times. A friend of mine said. The child was not found, and the police did not help. Karthik was lying. Everyone played with Shweta's mind. They were calling her crazy. Even I didn't believe her. Why didn't you say this, then? I feared for my life. Why did you say that now? Someone died because of me Is Riya alive? I haven't seen her since, only Bobby knows. - Who are you calling? - Bobby. - The phone is off. - Sir, I know where Bobby is! Then come on. - Oh God! - Who is that, sir? Vasant Khanna. They killed him thinking it was me. We have to catch Bobby before they find out who I am. Let's go.. Sir just a moment Come on sir Hello You killed someone else. - Sis.. - Rishi, the police have come to the house He is not the person I saw in the hotel. I have sent you the message. - They are enquiring about you. - About me? If you don't find the right person, will you kill any person you see? they are saying suicide or murder. - Sister, I'm coming - I'm coming Come on The police have come to my sister's house. Babukhan, the problem is serious. Everyone tries to hide the truth. The truth will come out only after getting Bobby. Babu Khan, catch him somehow. By any means. OK sir - Hey Bruno - What are you doing here, man? - I came... to tell secret. - What? I know who killed brother. Get out of here or I will kill you. - Bobby - Go inside. Bobby killed your brother. What!! Sister! Are you Rishi? - Reddy, do you have a match? - There's a lighter, sir. Shweta called you before her death. Why? This is the address given for the SIM card. You live in a hotel. What is going on? Hello, I'm asking you. Do we look stupid? Why did she call you? Are you her boyfriend? Secret affair or open affair? Does Karthik know this? How is this possible without him knowing? Do you pay him? Or does he pay you? Did you..? Don't insult her to get an answer from me. So You know the answer to my question It's you It's him. Reddy. He is the man. Let's go to the station. Take your hand Let's go.. - Um..? - Is Bobby inside? Why is he here? Bobby wanted him to come. I told you not to see me here. I'm hiding. And what the F is Babu Khan doing here? Why did you kill my brother? What? - Why did you kill Ola? - What are you talking about? I told a little lie. He believed. I feel like laughing at you. But I can't laugh. If I laugh, he will know that I lied. What? - He is lying. - I tell the truth He angry on me. He is terribly sentimental about his brother He wants revenge, he's going crazy. No matter what you say, he won't believe you anymore. Are you done? See he say he killed your brother very bad.. - No, he is lying. - Very bad. My brother died badly, you will die worse. Hey hey hey, don't shoot. Calm down Hit him as much as you want. But don't shoot. Don't shoot. I swear! I didn't do it. Fool I thought I was going to shoot. Why did Shweta call you? Madam... He doesn't say anything. Let's give him shock. Chaudhary Where do you come from? Why are you staying in a hotel? What is the relationship with Shweta? What was the fourth question? Reddy.. That.. Sir. After falling down... Hey, where did you go after you pushed Shweta down? Where were you when Shweta fell down? Where were you when her daughter was taken? Right here, I was sitting eating bajji. It was a bit oily but tasted good. I will ask the question and you just answer it. What do you mean her daughter is gone? Isn't she mental? It was seen in the file that she is mental. Did you know she's mental? Have you seen Mental? Have you ever met her? How much did you get paid to say this? Reddy, what is he always standing up? - I don't like this. - Sorry sir Why are you saying sorry? Shall I hit you? - Hey - Chowdhury.. - Stop. Sorry about that. It's just a police tactic. Chaudhary has nothing to do with the missing case. He is new here. We are trying to know why Shweta died. Rishi.. We need your help. It's been 2 months since her daughter went missing. Why do you care now? A month has passed since the case was settled. There was no evidence that she had a daughter. Shweta was... She has some mental problem. Oh, did he buy you too? How much? Did Karthik gave you 1 crore? Rishi, you are saying this emotionally. I am telling the truth. We investigated properly. There was no proof anywhere that Shweta had a daughter. What if I prove that there is? Hey Srinivasa Reddy, stop the over action. He is alive. Who is he? Bobby, Karthik's younger brother. Only he knows where Riya is. How can we arrest him without any evidence? Half of it is in the packet and the rest is in his body. Is this evidence enough madam? - Can he see us? - No If he has seen us, he won't say anything. He is dangerous. Where is the little girl Riya now? There is nothing here. - Where is Riya? - We will search for her together He has been given 2 lakhs not to tell us anything. Can you tell me where the child is? Nothing will happen to you. I will protect you. I will tell the truth. Touch one of these. He is beating him. - Will you let us do our job? - Then do it. Are you playing with the police? $#it Chaudhary, ask now. Where is Riya? - Remove the gun, please. - tell - Don't shoot - say. Don't shoot, don't shoot.. This is not going to work. Let's give a shock. .... Reddy!.. - Chaudhary.. Will you just shut up? - Not that... Madam, Do not move. You can't even get close to that case. You will kill me for nothing. Hey, stop it, no... Drop the gun. Put the gun down. BOBBY Listen to me. Put the gun down , bobby... If you don't leave me alone I will shoot. - Bobby relax... - I'll kill everyone. Drop the gun. Bobby, Put the gun down. Madam this is not a lock up death. It is self-defense. I am witness to that. I will look into that. You send the body for post-mortem. Rishi, I don't know why Shweta died, and I don't know what Bobby is hiding. I don't even know if Kartik is telling the truth. I don't even know if there is a Riya. But only one thing is true. I do not forgive the wrongdoer. Nothing else matters. Rishi, we need to talk. In private. Rishi Bhai, see you at my garage. - Are you OK? - No - Drink? - Yes. So, are you saying the reason why Shweta died is because she did not find her child? Yeah. But nobody cares. My husband. In an accident on our wedding anniversary 2 years ago.. He died on the spot. You traveled all the way from America and stayed here in a hotel. No one comes to the police station without any purpose. Did you love her? - It's your life, Damn it. - It's my father, Rishi. I understand the pain when loved ones are separated. This is my father's last wish. Shweta and I met in college. I don't have the guts to say no... ...nor the power to say yes. I have no one but my father. We were about to get married. - So Kartik? So what about me? After 2 days I will marry Karthik. I have to go Shweta, don't go. Goodbye Rishi - Madam.. - Um - I'm about to leave, madam - ok. - Raju...! - What ma'am? Take Lakshmi to Film Nagar. - Don't send her alone at this hour - OK ma'am You can go, Lakshmi. Sorry ...so.. Shweta asked for my help to find Riya. I couldn't refuse. Everyone hid the truth. Bobby, Principal, Africans, Karthik. Everyone The whole world hid the truth. She couldn't bear the fact that I believed it too. Shweta committed suicide. Not because of her thoughts. What is the proof that there is a girl? I found the height markings in Shweta's house. Everyone hid the truth about Riya. But she managed to find thist. Riya was kidnapped by Bobby and now he is dead. I need your help. There is only one person who knows the truth about Riya. Kartik... I may find Karthik. But Riya…. Kartik is not my goal. Riya is... For that you have to arrest Karthik. Rishi, we can't arrest somebody on guesses, we need proof. Even if we arrest him, he will take bail and will be released. This should be handled with caution. Give me one day, Rishi I was called here to find out what I was going to do. I came to tell about Karthik. If Shweta wakes up from coma and remembers me who broke up 4 years ago. How can she forget the daughter who was taken away just a month ago? See you tomorrow. Who else besides Rishi knows this? look Speak - Who are you? - Why did you come here? I thought you were going to the hotel. You saved me the taxi fare. Tighten him up. Babu Khan, I will take to the hospital. Work done? Left right now Just to confirm. This is Rishi's photo. Sorry There was no proof that she had a daughter. But she managed to find this - 2 policemen had come here. - We don't have a daughter Vasanth Khanna, Sub Inspector of Police. Then I saw her. Now he is dead. Sir, sir, sir.. where? Where are you going sir? I need to see ACP. - Madam is not at home. - Where did she go? I don't know, madam always goes out at this time. Drop off Lakshmi to Film Nagar bus stop. Is Lakshmi here? The one working at ACP's house.? - Is Lakshmi here? - Don't know Do you know anyone named Lakshmi? Do you know Lakshmi? The one working at ACP's home? Is there anyone named Lakshmi? Lakshmi. The one working at ACP's home? The one who works at police home? The house is on that corner. Where is ACP? She will be at the farmhouse. - Tell me the address, - I'll tell you Come on Chaudhary pick up... pick up That's my daughter, Sir That's not the way... Put the gun down Rishi, put the gun down... Now..! Take a walk What did you do to Riya? Where is Riya? Don't make noise. She is sleeping Don't! What you thought was true, Rishi. Riya is with me. She will be with me... As my daughter!! ACP! What you are doing is wrong. There is nothing wrong in this, Rishi. I liked Riya and I took her. But Karthik doesn't like her. He tried to kill her. What? Oh, don't you know? This is not a kidnap or car theft, Rishi. It was a murder! Money was in the boot. And the child was inside. They were paid to kill. Are you wondering how I know all this? Listen, I got an early. We will get ready for you by 6. OK. You are 2 hours early. Is that a problem? You have 3 days time. Let me know omce you're done. And don't forget, I have your passports. What was that? Nothing. Nothing. Mom! She called me mother. Don't shoot Don't shoot me, I'll tell you everything. Then I realized that her name is Riya. My husband was not the only one who died in the accident. It is also my unborn child. Riya, how is Riya? Riya was the name of our unborn daughter. This Riya calls me mother. I never thought someone would call me mother. After hearing her call it, I didn't correct her. Then I decided. She is my daughter. Once I lost a child. I can't afford to lose one more time. I was ready to do anything and kill anyone for her. - Riya is mine. - Yours? - Did you give birth? - No. I saved her. And you killed Shweta. So that? Am I supposed to feel sorry for her being in a coma and not being able to save her own daughter? You can't even understand the pain of a mother? ACP, You cannot hide the reality But I did. I erased her What do you want? I wnat Riya! He did everything. First, everything related to Riya was removed from the house. The principal was paid and silenced. My daughter died, they killed her. Shweta was knocked unconscious. She is now in a coma. When she wakes up from her coma, she won't see Riya. She can't bear it. So I am gonna try this. The police and the doctors said it was the right thing. I will tell her we don't have kids. This is not a good idea, Karthik. Do you have a better idea? Riya is already lost. I am not ready to lose Shweta too. Karthik, Calm down. Friends and family did as he told them. - Word for word. - Hello sir Rishi, you should appreciate my planning. Erasing a person's identity is not an easy task. Nigerians were killed. Threatened the businessman outside the school. FIR... Close the investigation, it's a time waste. I killed all those who came against me. - with precision - take the gun.. Systematically I played the game. and finished... Originally, Shweta was supposed to be killed while she was in a coma. But Karthik wanted her alive. Karthik wanted her to live a life in misery. Where is Riya? Riya? Who is Riya? Who, Shweta? Where is Riya? Karthik, Where is Riya? Riya's toys were here, photos were here. This was Riya's photo. Karthik, where is Riya? Where is Riya, Karthik? She wandered like a madwoman for Riya. - You know Riya, don't you? - Madam, you don't have children. Stop asking your neighbors about an imaginary child, Shweta. Are you saying I'm lying? I have a daughter. You need a psychiatrist, not the police. Take a look. Karthik happily shares her misery daily. How did she cry? How long did she cry? Sadist.. Karthik is not the sadist, ACP. You are You won't stop, Will you? Why are you so proud even when you are about to die? Don't make noise... She is sleeping. Scared ACP? Do you know what your weakness is? The mistakes you made From the moment I started asking questions. Didn't everything fall apart in a week? You are the last, Rishi. What? Why did Karthik wanted to kill Riya? Because Riya is not Karthik's daughter!!! Good bye, Rishi Life sentence is guranteed But I'll try to get you hanged. How can you think of killing a 3 year old child?? How can you be so cruel? Karthik , Shweta's reports all looks fine. But your reports... - You are sterile.. - What? Forget second child. You to have child is impossible. What $#it! I already have a daughter. Then that will not be your child, Kartik. Riya is not my daughter. She is someone else's Do you understand why Shweta called you to look for Riya, Rishi? Who else should I ask Rishi? Riya Rishi, wait! - Goodbye Rishi - Shweta please I love you. I'm not ready to let you go. You ready to see her? My daughter In life we want something. But destiny will take us to another place. No one knows when, how or why it will happen. When Shweta said she wanted to see me. I didn't know why. Now in such a big city, I found my daughter. Who are you? Life can change in a...
