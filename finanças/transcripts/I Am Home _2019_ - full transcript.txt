- Will this be your first house? - Sorry? Just wondering if it's your first. No, I think it's my sixth or seventh house. - Really? - Yes. You don't like this one either? No. No luck finding a new place? No. How should we fill it today? I know, right? Incoming call: Mum Jeju Island Airport Hey, Kang Eun-seo! You made it. What? You're pregnant, Sis? Didn't I tell you? I'm almost due. Hi, Eun-seo! We haven't met since Min-ho's first birthday. Right. Ga-ram, Min-ho. Greet her. Hello, ma'am! Not ma'am. I'm your aunt. Try again. They'll warm up to you. Eun-seo. Mum, she's here. So, let's eat. Come on in. Go. What? Come in. It's delicious. You didn't cook this yourself, right? You got someone to help you? I worked hard cooking these dishes. - This is your cooking? - Of course. I run a restaurant after all. I can whip up a meal like this. You've changed a lot, Mum. It feels so homely with everyone here. After buying my condo I thought I had everything. But seeing your place, Mum makes me want to switch with you. Still, a condo is more convenient than a house. How's this? You travelled all this way here. Why didn't you use a proper luggage bag? You make enough money to buy one. Yeah, I can afford one if I want one. Then why not? You've never travelled, have you? You think I came here because I wanted to? What? I'll take this. Happy? Eun-seo. People ask why we have no officiant. Well, it was hard to find someone who's older than us. Anyway, with your blessings we hope to live life to the fullest. Thank you very much. Applause. It's beautiful. Very classy. Oh, please. Where are you going on your honeymoon? Who knows? The opposite side of the world, maybe? Do you know where that is? Of course. It's Argentina. What did our stepdad say? He likes it. He wants to travel more. Now you'll get to travel all you want, Mum. I wonder how your father is doing. How would I know? He should be fine since there's no one for him to yell at. Does he still live in that house? Knowing Dad, he's probably still living there. What? I don't know either. Hey. - You should know at least. - Why should I? You're the only one who can meet with him without things getting awkward or tense. You were close with your dad. Since when? You don't remember? You always wanted to sit beside him in the car. I never got to sit in the front. I don't remember that. So what if she's book-smart? She's dense as a brick about everything else. Don't pick on me! You're one to talk. - Kang Eun-seo! - What? Kang Eun-joo. Stop it. Be nice to each other. Take this home to eat. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. - Yo. - What the heck? Just come inside. What are you doing out there? - Soju or beer? - Soju. Something's up, right? - Just come in, hurry. - OK. My old room is a closet now? Did your boyfriend move out? He left a long time ago. Close the door. The smell will get in. Why aren't you moving? You move all you want, I'm staying. Do you have gold buried here or something? My youth is here. If I leave here I feel like I'll grow old like you. And this place gives me lots of inspiration. So you'll live your whole life in this basement? Who cares if it's a basement? This place is home. You brought rice cakes too? I got cactus tea too. This is why I'm the only friend you have. I have a great idea. What are you doing? I got an idea. - There. - What? Hold your horses. Hey, isn't this awesome? This is unbelievable. Your mum hasn't aged a single day since she moved to Jeju Island. - She looks much younger. - I know. Ask her what kind of makeup she uses. I don't know. I'm sleeping here tonight. You can't. - My boyfriend's coming over. - What? Didn't you say you broke up? We broke up because I met someone new. Show off! What youth and inspiration? This place gives you lots of men, right? Hey, it's the same thing. Men and inspiration are one and the same. Don't you get it? You're annoying. Yeah, I am. You're neither young nor old. You're neither here nor there. Hey. Go out and date! Stop looking for a house. Why are you taking it off? I say, why are you taking it off? I have a spare key in the house. It's good to see you, Dad. He couldn't have waited? Why did you come out? Why did you leave without telling me? If I'm gone, I'm gone. What? I didn't say anything. That was a really nice place. Why didn't you like it? It's just not the house for me. I don't think I can find the house you're looking for. Most of the tenants are either foreigners or here on business. Some stay here temporarily for personal reasons. That makes sense. When are you looking to move in? A week later. My current lease is up then. - You'll stay until you find a place? - Yes. You don't need to bring anything with you. We have everything you need here. Right. We just ask that you refrain from shifting the furniture around. So if there are no questions give me a call when you want to move in. Gloves, towels, hats, sauna Excuse me. Ma'am? Oh... - Hello. - Hi, Mr Locksmith. Sorry, I can't hear very well. How is this colour? You have a good eye. That's our most popular colour. - Really? - They sell like hot cakes. But... this is a better colour for men. Oh, hi. The landlord can't come. He said to give you the key. - Really? - Yes. Thank you. Let's go. What's wrong? The bookstore I used to visit is gone. I see. - Incheon's your hometown? - Yes. - This place has changed so much. - Yeah. Nothing appear and disappear as fast as they do in our country. Out to work - Do I unload here? - No. - Through the blue door, please. - Sure. How old is that calendar? - What are you doing? - Oh my! You startled me. - Did you clean, Dad? - What? Why? Is something missing? No. Just wondering. Dad, what are you doing? Why did you open my stuff without asking? Aren't you going to unpack? I'm going to move out once I find a place. OK, come out to eat when you're ready. Dad! Let's order Chinese food. Sure. Don't drizzle the sauce, we'll dip instead. Isn't it stuffy inside a windowless room? Will customers call you more if you stare at your phone? What do you want? Why didn't you say you cooked? We didn't have to order in then. You said you wanted Chinese. It's not that I wanted Chinese... Forget it. I'm going to bed. God, it's stuffy in here. Yes? This is the locksmith. My goodness! You startled me. People call at this hour? Don't wear those slippers. Buy your own to wear. Don't be so cheap. You'll catch athlete's foot. Keys Sold Hither I'm going to work. Will you be home late? Yeah, I'll be home past midnight. Out to work Eun-seo! Incheon Station My company pays for cabs. Why did you come? Hop in. It's freezing. Seatbelt. Do you know the difference between travellers and tourists? Tourists return home after their trips but travellers leave for other places instead of going home. How about a trip this winter to... - Welcome. - Hello. What would you like? Cabbage... Would that be all? Ms Kang. Are you playing Tetris with words? Your article is one solid block of words. It's all black! Like carbon paper. Look. People don't build houses at random, right? They design things according to how people live. They consider what would be comfortable. Articles should be the same. It should be easy on the reader's eyes. Can't you make this easier to read? Hey, put an image here. Hell, this solid block of text. It's not a house, but a warehouse. You know? On-call locksmith. Did you lose your key? A keypad? No keys? Oh, a digital door-lock. I'm sorry. I can't repair that. Sorry. It's done. That's enough, sir. Thank you. Have a nice day. You and I both need to get new jobs. What are you saying? You have a good job. Who reads the newspapers these days? Don't be silly. It used to be a peach field here. How did you know? We're here. It was a peach farm when I first moved here. Now, it's just a stretch of condos. I almost forgot it used to be a farm. How did you remember that? My mother was born in Sosa. I see. That's why you know the area so well. I came to look at the pre-construction model homes here 20 years ago with my wife. Good thing you didn't buy then. The property prices here haven't gone up much. I couldn't afford a place here back then. Buy one now. Condos are everywhere. - It's done. - Thank you. Wait, please. I'll go get the money. It's not a house, but a warehouse. What are you mumbling about? Hi. It's your day off. Don't you have a date? Nope. Get dressed. Why? Give me a drink too. You drink soju? Not as much as you do. So don't worry. Are you still looking for a house? What? Yeah. Won't it be expensive near your company? Everywhere is expensive in Seoul. Find a nice place so you won't regret it later. OK. I got it. Eat up. Gee, this is burnt. It's burnt. Don't eat it. I said, don't eat it! - Hello! - How are you, Mr Kang? Hi. My youngest. Hi. You're all grown up now. Aren't you getting married? I know how hard life's been for your dad. Be successful and treat him well. Enough of your nonsense. I'm eating with my daughter. Drink without me today. I only have sons. I'm so jealous. Why not have a daughter now? Hey! What? What? I'm not a kid. Of course you are. Cut back on your drinking. Come on. Hurry up. - Hello. - Hi. - Just one second. - OK. I'm sorry. My sister must've forgotten that I've moved. It's OK. Take care. 3B8, Iksan. Kang Eun-joo Hey. - What? - It's peach kimchi. When did you make this? Is your sister doing well? She never calls, not once. You were the one who said you never wanted to see her again. She came home pregnant! She left home without a word and started a family without telling us! We're having dinner, why are you yelling? Go and yell at Eun-joo, don't take it out on me. Why didn't you stop me from moving back home? How could you? Don't blame me. Why would I stop you from going home? You don't know my dad. He drinks too much, he's cheap and selfish. He even ate the ramen that Eun-joo sent. I have no idea what he's thinking. It's so frustrating! Sounds like you really take after your dad. - You should talk. - No, I don't! Why is there no dialogue in this movie? Just watch it. You're supposed to watch and feel it. They need to talk more so I know what's going on. Who needs words? Why not just speak? What? What do you think I'm trying to say? I won't know unless you tell me. You're really hopeless sometimes. I'm leaving. Is it that boring to you? It's not over yet. I have to catch the last train. You live so far away. It's annoying. I don't want to go. I'm leaving again. I'll call when I get back. Where to? I don't know yet. Kang Jin-cheol Why am I doing this? Don't just use your head, but your body too. Don't lie down all day and just move your fingers. I'm using my head so I don't have to use my body. - Which paper is this? - Not again? Seoul Daily. What about this? Media Newspaper. Come on. Stop quizzing me. How can you tell just from their font type? It's pretty amazing. I've spent years in the industry. Of course I'd know. What is it? Where are you? You're his daughter, right? - Yes. - I've heard so much about you. I read Woori News too. Thank you. Master Kang is totally amazing. Thank you, sir! I would've been in a rut if it weren't for you, sir. You saved me from the embarrassment. I should know how to get it open. I taught you to practise more. But I only come across safes once or twice a year. I learnt how to open digital locks and install them though. It's good business, sir. That's good. Here, sir. Forget it. But you're the one who opened it, sir. It's OK. In that case, please accept this since Master Kang won't. - Come on... - I said it's OK. Come on... You're always like this, sir. - Came on your scooter? - No. Hop in. It's cold. I'll drive you back. Master. I bought a new car! Let's drive down to Incheon Port sometime to see the sunset like you like, sir. You should've bought a house instead. Anyway, congratulations. It's all thanks to you, Master Kang. It's because you worked hard. Give me that. How can you tell by looking in the hole? You have to know what's inside to open it. And that's how you open it. Wow! How did you do that? Skills, either you have it or you don't. Do it again. May I try? Okay, put this in here first. Hold this and turn it like this. - Like this? - There. Hold it in your left like a pencil. Go deep in the hole turn, then pull in one motion. No need to pull so hard. Do it gently. In one shot. That's it. OK. - Am I doing it right? - Yes. What's up? Did I write it wrong before? "Hither" is not used much nowadays. But it wasn't wrong. See you later. Keys Sold Here Hello? Please unlock it, sir. Please answer the phone, Granny. Is it open? Hello? Granny? Hello? Granny? Hey! Come quickly! Granny! Are you OK? Call for support! - Granny! - Granny, can you hear me? - Do you hear me, ma'am? - Open your eyes! - Granny, open your eyes! - Emergency! Granny, can you hear me? Dad? Your phone. It's ringing. Aren't you going to answer it? Dad? Answer it. What if it's a customer? Just go to work. Closed. Thank you for your understanding. No, thank you. What? You're home? Why are you sitting there in the dark? You're drinking again? Why keep the door closed in a windowless room? - Don't you find it stuffy? - Shut the door! Why are you yelling? Is something wrong? Tell me. Say it. I'm listening. Don't ignore me. Tell me what's wrong. - I said, shut the door. - Dad... I'm worried about you. Who asked you to worry about me! I told you not to yell! Curb that temper of yours! Are you looking for a house or not? Why are you bringing that up now? Are you planning to live here forever? You said this is temporary! You'd find a place and move out. You're yelling at me to leave? I forgot. Yeah... this is who you are. You chased Mum and Eun-joo out. Of course I'm no exception. I'll come for my stuff later. You know what? Everyone does better after they leave you. You chased Eun-joo out and she's doing well! Mum left you... got remarried and lives in a great house. You're the only one who still lives like this! Aren't you printing it out? - Chief will be here soon. - I'll get on it. Eun-seo! What brings you to Seoul? Where's your husband? He dropped me off and left. We'll meet at the airport tomorrow. Let's go. Here. It's like a hotel room here. There was no direct flight from Jeju Island? No, there wasn't. Thanks to that, I get to see you. - They have this too? - Yes. It's nice and convenient here. This place comes fully furnished. It's no place to live. Why? It's not a home to stay but one to leave. It's temporary housing. It's only until I find a house of my own. Nice night view. Why aren't you sleeping? I can't sleep. Why not? Because I'm excited. I'm finally going travelling. I'm like a child who's up all night all excited about a field trip. Why do you want to go to Argentina? When we got married... your dad was sorry we couldn't go on a honeymoon. So he took me to a mall and bought me a travel bag. On our way home he watched an airplane fly past and made me a promise. He said we'll buy a condo and fly to the opposite side of the world someday. Well... I only used that bag once. When I left home. He still lives there, right? Yes. Why doesn't he make a window in his room? He said if he did, he might live there forever. He didn't want that. It's just a window... So much like your dad... - Me? - No. That house. Temporarily Closed Hello? Who's this, please? I didn't know either. I covered for him for half a day or so before but it's my first time filling in for several days. I did think it was unusual. This wasn't his first time? Your sister lives in Iksan, right? He asked me to fill in for him when he went to meet her. He'd never do that. It's true. He showed me a picture of her condo and bragged about it. Ms Kang, please don't be too angry with him. He's probably feeling lost and scared. He's human too. Hey. "Hey"? She's my youngest who works for a newspaper in Seoul. Hello. Go out and grab something to eat. It's OK. Why didn't you take my calls? I'm your daughter, Dad. Why should I hear about you from someone else? Don't overreact. I'll take care of myself. Don't worry and just do your job. Why are you so selfish? You're fine with this, and that makes it OK? Where are you going? The toilet. - Are you Mr Kang's family? - Yes. He said he must go back and check on his house before his surgery. Do you know about this? Dad! What are you doing over there? You're having surgery? Yeah. Then you should stay in the hospital. Why did you ask to go home? I won't be home in a while once I have my surgery. I wanted to check on my house. The house is not going anywhere. It'll be exactly where you left it. Right. People are the ones who leave. Made from this year's peaches? Yes. It's delicious. Can you make more next year? - Why? - Let's send some to Eun-joo. To repay her for the ramen we ate. Dad. Look. It's Ga-ram and Min-ho. They're so big now. Why? Don't you want to see? He called me "ma'am". He might call you "mister". Her third kid is due soon. Really? You didn't know? So you just saw the condo and not Eun-joo? Since you went all the way there why didn't you meet with her? Can you make this bigger? Is it big inside? I've never been in there either. Why not? If you're so curious, why didn't you go in? - How? - You could go in if you want. I'm not a burglar. No, I mean go and see Eun-joo. Want to take a trip together, Dad? What's this talk of a trip all of a sudden? Let's go before your surgery. We've never been away together. To where? How about Jeju Island? Are you crazy? You don't want to go because Mum's there? She's not there right now. Where did she go? The opposite side of the world. Can you see the sea from your mum's bedroom window? When I opened the window in the morning, I could smell the sea. It's a different smell from Incheon sea. The sound of the waves felt closer too. Mum sat by the window, drank coffee and watched the sea for a while. How did she look? She was smiling. It reminded me of how she used to smile. You know what she has all around her place? Tangerines. Tangerines? Tangerines in every room within easy reach. Maybe that's why the whole house smelled of fresh tangerines. Like how our house used to be filled with the scent of peaches. Sounds lovely. Name: Kang Jin-cheol. Gender: Male Date: February 15.
