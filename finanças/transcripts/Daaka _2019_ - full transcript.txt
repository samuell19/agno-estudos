'That's Shinda.' 'His parents passed away soon after his birth.' 'Leaving this three-legged cot for him.' 'Burdened with poverty, he sleeps a lot these days.' Wake up, Shinda. Wake up, son. What is wrong, uncle? Today is the last day to get the yellow card made. Go and get it. Yes, I will. It's already 11 am. When do you plan to go? - It's 11 am? - Yes. Oh no, 11 missed calls! I was supposed to meet Lali's father today. 'Your call cannot connect because of insufficient balance.' Fine, I'll call from uncle's phone. Give me your phone, uncle. - Hello? - Lali, it's Shinda. Where are you? Daddy's waiting for you. I just woke up. At 11 am? Quickly get ready and come home. Can we reschedule it for tomorrow? Today is the last day to get the yellow card made. Yellow card? What's that? It's for people under poverty line. We will get everything for free after we get married. Just send me a good picture of your in old worn out clothes. - Why? - It's made for the ladies. I'll get your card made even before we get married. Have some shame, Shinda. You are getting excited like you are getting me a green card. What should I tell my father you do? I am just to make a bright future for us. Hurry up. My girl will get suspicious when she will check my calls. Lali, call me back on my phone. I don't have any talktime left. You have nothing that one needs in a husband. I should better find someone else. Lali! Hello? Lali? What? She insulted you? A little. Uncle, how will I ever get married? First delete this girl's number from my phone. If your aunt finds out then I won't have a wife either. Here uncle, try to save your marriage. Go. What are you waiting for, tea? Tea is being made for last 10 years. You keep getting upset over small things. Let me be somebody before I meet your daddy. I have been hearing that since two years. What have you done so far? I went from a tea stall to a mobile stall. How is that progress? You will never be happy when someone progresses. That is the reason Salman Khan doesn't get married. He thinks after he gets married his wife will say "So what if a few hundred million people know you?" Let's stick to you here. What's the difference between a tea stall and a mobile stall? There is a lot of difference. Sit down. First of all, my clothes no longer get dirty. Secondly, Airtel, Jio, Vodafone, and the kind.. They all request me to sell their things. You will see, one day Shinda Jatt will be so famous that.. ..your father will come to you and ask you.. ..how do you like that mobile guy? And I would say.. I hate him. Whenever I want you to meet your father.. ..you make some excuse and send me away. Why don't you say that you are not serious about me. You don't want to marry me. Why are you so sad? Try to understand, there is a big difference between us. How do I face your father? Balli is talking to a few companies. We will soon get an agency of a Chinese phone. Then I will come to meet your father. You are seeking Balli's help to become successful? Balli is seeking my help to become successful. Look, I know he works more but I am smarter. You know how smart he is. Then why did you make "your father" your partner? Father's have a right, don't they? Don't try to twist my words. Give me some more time. I have a feeling that something big is about to happen. I'll quickly set up a good business and approach your father. I'll go and get Balli. He must be waiting for me. We need to open our stall. You open your stall at 12 pm. We are the boss. I am just joking. Balli does another job. I have to go and relieve him. Here, enjoy your meal. Potatoes again? You know that she isn't keeping well. You cannot get her the right treatment.. ..so at least feed her right. Potatoes are good for health. You don't like them because they are cheap. If they become expensive.. ..then people will start talking. "Balli served potatoes again!" That's it. Please forgive me. Doctor asked us to give her green vegetables. What's that green cabbage called? - Bruce Lee. - Yes. Have you ever given her that? I had once seen it in the city. When I asked for its price.. ..I learnt that we cannot even afford to see it. Gurmeet, I too love Simran as much as you do. I try my best to get her treated. I'll make arrangements for the money any way I can. Let's go, Balli. You can do household work in the evening. Coming, Shinda. I'll leave now to open the stall. Trust me, we will get her treated. Bye, dear. See you. Why don't you come on time? My wife was massaging my feet. I said you can do that at night. She will strangle you if she hears that. Oh no. I am out of fuel. Hello! - Who are you talking to? - Your grandfather. Why didn't he also get a fuel pump for you along with the motorbike? I have some fuel. That one you stole from Seth's scooter? Right. My grandfather's motorbike has turned me into a thief. - Hello, Seth. - Hello. Why don't you come early? In the cities, showrooms open by 11 am. - That early? - Yes. You too should open our showroom early. Okay. Sweep the place. - Shinda? - Yes? Someone stole our broom. This village is full of thieves. Are you talking about me? No Sethji, I wouldn't dare. May we borrow your broom? Yes, and let's talk after you are done sweeping. About the aunt who was asking for your phone number? No, she called me already. Let's talk after you are done sweeping. You have me worried. First, tell me what is this about. Fine, sit down. I have decided to sell this shop. I want to sell this and invest in a store in the city. Seth, just because we didn't pay two months' rent.. ..you are looking for excuses to make us move? We will pay you the rent. We aren't running away. We have barely started our work. Try to understand, Shinda. Otherwise, my work will get stuck. Are you sweeping his shop? What are you doing here sitting all dejected? Do I have to sweep the place every day? Look Shinda, both of you are like sons to me. If doesn't make a difference to me.. ..whether or not you pay me the pending rent. But I will have to sell this shop. One more thing. The one who might purchase this shop.. ..might not let you keep your stall here. You should make arrangements for that as well. Sit down, don't fall on me. Sethji, we will be on the streets then. - I am helpless, Balli. - Hello, Sethji. - Hello. - We want to arrange a Ramleela. - In my shop? - No, at the Ramleela ground. We are here to give donation slips. Don't give me a slip, I'll come there and donate. What about you? I'll come with him and seek blessings. Yeah, right! - Seth? - Yes? Give us some time, we will purchase your shop. You cannot even manage pay the rent. How will you get Rs. 250,000? - We will do something. - Yes. Did you read today's newspaper? People are doing frauds worth 500 millions rupees. And you seek time to pay Rs. 250,000? Anyway, you initiated this. Try to arrange for Rs. 250,000. Look at the newspaper sometimes, SHO! It's been 7 days since Sukhchan escaped. You are still hunting for clues? Sir, the entire force is working at it. We will surely find a clue. You should have arrested him by now. You know the pressure I am facing? 500 million fraud is a big deal. This is not longer restricted to your office. It has reached the CM's office. Sir, Sukhchan must have not left our area. I will find him, sir. As soon as possible. Otherwise, you will find a letter on your table after four days. Your transfer letter. Now get out. Sir. - Baint Singh? - Yes, sir? Drop everything else and find Sukhchan. - Yes, sir. - Sir, I told you.. ..we should solve Sukhchan's case first. You are the one who said.. ..we want to send our kids to an expensive school. So, we should put up some check posts. You should have been a woman. You mean a lady constable? - We will all get transferred. - Yes, sir. - Use everyone in the police station to look for Sukhchan. - Yes, sir. - Got it? - Okay, sir. Why do you look so sad? Did anything go wrong? No, what could go wrong? This is how we look, Khundi. Tell me about yourself, you doing good? What good? I have dislocated my shoulder. Dr. Khan has asked me to not to carry a gun for a few days. Manager doesn't want the gun off my shoulder. Bank needs security after all. What security? I used to be a peon. They gave me a gun 3 years ago. They said you just need to carry it. No one is going to rob this place. This means if someone tries to rob a bank.. You don't even know how to shoot? No, carry it on the shoulder is enough. No one is going to rob a bank here. Come on! So you are like the scarecrow they use in the fields. Something like that. I used to get Rs. 8,000 as a peon. They gave me a raise of Rs. 2000. They asked me to carry this gun. It has benefited me. I carry a gun and offer tea to others. He is better than us. He makes Rs. 10,000 a month. Machi, put it on tab. - Shinda? - Yes. Don't tell anyone in the village that I don't know how to shoot a gun. Fine, we won't. Meshi? You too don't tell anyone. Everyone in the village knows that they shouldn't tell anyone. Right. "You have cat eyes and chubby cheeks." "Your body talks to me." Who is it? Hello? Good morning, sir. Good morning. Who is it? Sir, this is Aditi from Davindra Holiday Club. We are offering you a 5 Nights and 6 days free trip to Singapore. Why's the occasion? - What? - Yes. Can you tell us how much income tax do you pay, sir? I don't pay any income tax. I hold a yellow card. What is that? Those who don't have food to eat get this. Okay tell me, how much money do you spend over a person's holiday? On an average 2,50,000 per couple. I'll be damned. Then why don't you give me this money directly? I'll buy a shop for myself. Good sense of humour, sir. Sir, are you salaried or self-employed? We are Kangs, we are Jatts. I am asking you about your work, sir. What work do you do, sir? Oh! I have a mobile stall. I repair mobiles. I also.. hello? Hello? Hello, Aditi? It got disconnected. What is this? It's AC got burnt. We will need to get a new one from the city. God, I feel like cursing you. I had just one phone and that too got ruined. Don't we have any other mobile? We have a few of our clients. They can come any time to collect it. We can put two sims in your mobile, right? - Yes. - Put my sim in it. - And Balli, my bed.. - The broken one? Yes. It broke some more. You should curse God for two minutes. You will feel better. - Yes. - Shinda! You are always busy working. How about thinking about God too sometimes? I was just about to. What can I do for you? Ramleela is just around the corner. You still didn't give any donation. - Look brother! - Yes. I can be Sugreev in the play. But I cannot give any donation. Get going. - It is done? - It is working. Now you assume that your phone got water damaged. I am joking. Yes, sir. Sir, we can beat anyone into confessing that he is Sukhchan. It will save our skin. And what about the 500 million? - What will we say where did it go? - We'll say we found him by the river. Money got carried away in the water. How did you get this job? My father passed away. I got his job. - Oh, I see. That's why. - Yes, sir. Go and get me tea. Go. Who is it? Keep driving. It shows Janu calling. My wife. I have saved my girlfriend also as Janu. - What do I do now? - Put it on speaker. Hello? Where are you, Shinda? - Yours. - Mine. I am in the village, Lali. What happened? You know the manager of the bank in your village? Yes! Is he dead? No. I have got a marriage proposal from him. He holds a government job. Daddy likes him as well. You can keep loitering with that idler Balli. Lali, I am about to buy the shop outside which I set up my stall. I'll come to meet your father as soon as the deal is finalised. When? After my marriage? I should have something to say to your father. Give me just a few more days. You know I can't say much to my father. You do as you feel right. I'm hanging up now. Shinda, my wife has two bangles. Let's sell them and get the shop. What are you saying? Simran is unwell. You might need them. But the shop is important as well. We will solve this issue. Hop on, let's find a solution. - Sir, we have arranged for the money. - Oh really? We'll give it to you as soon as we get the money. - So from now, this shop is ours. - Congratulations. Hey! What is this nonsense? No advance or documentation. How is this shop yours now? How much advance are you giving me? How much do you want? According to the usual 25% it comes to around Rs. 72,500. But I know you guys, so you tell me how much can you give? If you are being so considerate then be a little more considerate. We will pay the whole amount together. Oh no. I have always said yes to someone in the city. I won't be able to say no to them. He's taking a u-turn. Don't get angry, sir. Tell me, how much should we give you? Give whatever you can, we will handle it. Shinda, he is just polite, he won't move an inch. Whatever, but we will have to give him something. Otherwise, he will say no. - How much money do you have? - I have.. Rs. 500.. Rs. 620.. Rs. 720. From where did you get so much money? Forget that. Your 720 plus this, we have 790 now. We cannot give him all the money we have. We give 1000 rupees as two months' rent. And we will give only 790 as an advance for the shop? At least talk to him. Don't bother. I will get it handled in the village itself. Yes? This is great. - Congratulations. - How much is it? Rs. 790. We will give the balance as and when in small instalments of 100s. Quickly. Take this. Have you ever heard me curse? You will, today. Scoundrels! You are supposed to give Rs. 72,500. You could have given Rs. 50,000. You could have given Rs. 40,000. What kind of a joke is this? Sir, Jatts and Baniyas don't get along. There are so many stories about this. You can prove all those stories wrong today. You can create history. By giving a hug to this Jatt. We will become one life. Can you give all the money in five days? In seven days? It will be difficult. I'll be considerate with you, can you give all the money in 15 days? Yes. I am getting Rs. 2,50,000 right away. Don't complain on the 16th day that I gave the shop to someone else. - Clear? - Clear. All set? All good? - How are you, Khundi? - Good, brother. What brings you to the bank? We have come to rob it. Go ahead. That will give me a chance to check my gun. We have come to take a loan, brother. Don't shoot us. - Hurry up. - Ms. Pushpa. Does your husband still hit you? Times have changed. - Now I hit him. - That's good. Complete the file. Auntie, we want a loan. Have some shame. I must be a few years younger than you. Kiddo, we want a loan. Go and talk to the manager. I don't want to talk to him. You give it to me. You will have to talk to the manager about the loan. Go inside. Hello. How can I help you? We want to... We need a loan of 250,000 rupees. What work do you do? We repair mobile phones. What's your ITR? We don't do the things rich people do. I am talking about income tax. Do you play tax? Why would we seek a loan if we had any income? But one thing's for sure. If my girlfriend leaves me and marries someone else.. ..then too she will come back only to me. What does this have to do with the loan? Do you have any agricultural land? Then on what behalf should we give you a loan? Bank should have a guarantee that it will get its money back. Okay. We can go to the Gurudwara and promise. Promises won't give you a loan. Let's talk if you have any documents. Otherwise, you may leave. Go. Let's go. Did they come here to take a loan or to scare me? How much loan do you want? 250,000 rupees. 250,000 rupees? Do you want to shut this bank down? 250,000 rupees is the total amount bank has. If we will give you all the money what will we do in there, play monopoly? Then this is a useless bank. Brother, small banks only get small deposits. Just imagine why would they give a peon a gun? Because there is nothing in the bank. Then why are you carrying the burden? You are just hurting your shoulder. It is a rule. Whether or not there is anything in the bank.. ..there has to be security guard outside it. Even the gun must be wondering what am I doing in a bank. If it has been at a Jatt's place it would get fired every day. Like firecrackers! That reminds me, I took it at home for Diwali. I thought I'd shoot if before my kids. The trigger got stuck when I tried to shoot. I came here and told the manager. He said it will cost 3300, use your salary and get it repaired. I thought I shouldn't bother then. Khundi, what if anything untoward happens in the bank? It can be used as a stick then. And if anything untoward happens I anyway cannot handle it by myself. I can guard the front, but what will we do about the backdoor? They just have 5-foot tall walls. Anyone can jump across those. There must be someone guarding the backdoor as well. Oh great. They don't have enough staff to handle the banking duties. Who will they keep at the backdoor? These bankers are not worried just because.. ..they share a wall with the police station. That's enough to scare anyone. If someone comes from the backdoor, no one at the police station will know. Stop lying, Khundi. You can scream and call the policemen. They will come in no time. Why are you making me disclose all secrets? This bank is running on God's support. This is inviting a robbery then, Khundi. If nothing they should raise the walls to 10-foot. You guys are great. There is just 250,000 in the bank. You want them to spend it on making the walls? You guys don't have any sense. That's why none of your businesses work. - I'll hit you with this glass. - Let it be. We were saying this for your own good. We couldn't care much if you made break the walls.. ..sell the rubble and keep the money in the bank. - Meshi, put it on my tab. - Okay. I'll tell the manager that two super-smart people paid a visit. They cannot pay Meshi and they want a loan from bank. - Right, Meshi. - Yes. I don't know how do I purchase that shop, Lali. The more I try to move forward the further I go. This means you won't even be able to use the stall? Seems so. That's why I said, how do I face your father? I thought I would try talking to him about us when he is in good mood. He won't let him daughter marry an unemployed man. Perhaps God wants me to marry someone else. Lali, please don't marry the bank manager. He won't keep you happy. I had gone to him to seek loan. He thinks he is someone very important. He will behave like that at home as well. I cannot say no because he is bad. I should have a reason to tell my father that you are better than him. If you were so concerned about me.. ..you should have done something by now. I want to, but my fate doesn't support me. The least I can expect is your support. We are live from Kumkala police station. Punjab police has finally been successful in arresting.. ..Sukhchan who scammed government of 500 million. We are in Kumkala, district Ludhiana. Police has been successful is capturing a very clever criminal. Yes, we are talking about Sukhchan Singh. He has done a scam of 500 million. We have not been able to talk to the SHO of this police station.. ..and find out how did he manage to arrest such a clever criminal. So, Sukhchan got arrested, how do you feel? I am feeling very good, brother. But the amount of money that he has, police will treat him like a guest. - That's a huge crowd. - Khundi? Why are so many people gathered here? Is there a show at the police station? They arrested Sukhchan. - What! - Let us do our work. Look, bad deeds meet bad ends. What will he do with the 500 million now? Police will beat him black and blue.. ..and make him even forget how to count till 50. Right? Bye. Shinde, good, we did not think of earning so much.. ..otherwise our condition would have been the same. I'd suggest we shouldn't sit with Khundi anymore. If we don't hear about it we won't think about it. - Right. - Let's go and open our stall. Get lost! This is yours? Hello. I was waiting for you. Seth, you have given us 15 days to pay. It's not even been 3 days. Look, I thought of something. How will you manage to arrange 250,000 at such a short notice? Tell me. Why don't you say something? What do we say? We are trying. Look son, don't lie to me. Villagers told me that I shouldn't waste 15 days on you. You won't be able to get the money. I am thinking about your wellbeing here. There is one option if you are interested. If you two sell your houses, you can gather Rs. 250,000 easily. What are you saying, Seth? Where will we stay? Son, a Baniya is saying that to you. Remember this. If you have a shop you can use it to make a house. But if you have a house, you cannot use it to make a shop. You can work hard and buy a home later. Until then stay on rent. He is right. How is he right? You have a child. If the business fails you won't even have a house. It's not like we are doing good. We are anyway doomed. Let's take a chance. Let it be. Seth, we said 15 days, so you will get the money in 15 days. Okay? On the 16th if we haven't paid you then you can do whatever you want. - Clear? - Clear. Come on. Meshi, make tea. Two cups. Don't worry. It's okay if we lose the shop. We will open a tea stall. Right, ruin my business. We will set it up somewhere else. We won't take your business. Shinde, look there. Shinda? Shinda? Who is Shinda, dear? - Daddy, didn't I tell you about him? - Okay. Shinda, my daddy. - Hello, uncle. - Hello. What are you doing here? I had come to deposit money in the bank. It is not right to keep a lot of cash at home, uncle. You are right, son. - Times are bad. - Yes. You save money with great difficulty. You should keep your savings in the bank. We are going to the bank now. I know the manager. Let me introduce you as well. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. He will help us get better returns. You are back to take a loan? Come with me. Do your work, come on. - Hello, uncle. - Hello. - Hello, Lali. - Hello. You are back? Sukhdev, we know them. They have come to deposit money in your bank. But uncle, they don't have an account in this bank. - They don't have any account? - Yes. We want to open a new account and deposit the money. No problem. We'll open a new account. We are here to open new accounts. Let's go. Come, Lali. Come with me. Brother, new accounts are opened over here. Please have a seat. - Pushpa? - Yes, sir? Open a new account for them and deposit their money. - Please have a seat. - Okay, sir. Lali, uncle, please come with me. Have a seat, I'll get the form. Uncle, you always said that you will come here. So you have finally come here today. Yes, I am finally here. Have a seat. What would you like tea or a cold drink? No, thank you. Not done. Lali, what about you? - No, thank you. - What will we deposit? We don't have any money. Let's deposit your kidneys instead. You are the one who go us here. We usually used to get insulted outside the bank. Today we will get insulted inside the bank. Think about how we will get out of here. Let's go home. Why are you torturing yourself? Let's go, Balli. Here's the form. Fill it. Also give me a copy of your PAN and Aadhar Card. I only have an Aadhar Card. Then let it be. We'll come some other time. - Let's go. - Keep coming here, uncle. Pushpa, did you open the account? Sir, they don't have a PAN Card. It's okay. He'll give it some other time. He is well known to uncle. Open the account. How much money will you deposit? Tell her. How much money can one deposit at the most in your bank? Brother, a bank has the capacity of the sea when it comes to money. You can deposit as much as you want. Think before you reply. I don't even have a penny in my pocket. I want to deposit 100,000 rupees. Uncle, I am about to buy a shop. I had the money at home for that. I thought why keep it at home. The deal hasn't gone through as yet. So I should deposit it in the bank. You are going to buy a shop? Look daddy, Shinda is trying his best to progress. But why isn't the deal going through, son? Well, Seth won't budge from 250,000 rupees. I thought he should reduce a little as it is not worth that much. Then why don't you ask daddy to mediate? He has been a government school teacher. Everyone in and around the village respects him. Seth will surely be considerate with him. No, it is not right to trouble uncle over such a small thing. Son, what is the harm if my mediation helps you? Let's go meet Seth. We will give him 100,000 and ask him how much can he go down for me. - Right? - Let's go! Let's go! - Bye. - Bye. Bye, Lali. Is he trying to influence my Lali? Here you go. Hello, Mohanlal. - Hello. Sir, you? - Hello. How can I help you? These kids told me that they wish to buy your shop. Yes, they do. I know them quite well. Then I don't know to worry. I'll give them as much as time they want. - We don't want time. - Okay. -You will get the money on time. - Okay. - You asked for 250,000, right? - Yes. Now tell me, how much can you go down for me. We'll give you 100,000 right away. Look, I won't lie to you. A merchant in the city has quoted 250,000 for it. Now I will do as you say. Tell me boys, how much will you pay him? Uncle, thank you for speaking to him, now we will handle the rest. Look, they had accepted to pay 250,000. I can give 10,000 rupees discount for you. Shinda, give 100,000 to Seth. - They will give it to me? - Yes. I thought you will give it. Actually, these boys had cash in hand. They were about to deposit it in the bank as deal didn't went through. I told them that I would accompany them. - You won't say no to me. - Okay. Thank you very much for giving me so much respect. Bye, Shinda. Come home in the evening. Okay? - Bye. - Sir? - Yes. - The 100,000 rupees advance? At least give me that. Uncle, I think in a hurry I forgot the money at home. I'll give it to you in the evening. You are just like family. Bye, Sethji. We will be leaving now. Son, do come home in the evening. - We will have sweets ready for you. - Okay. Let's go, dear. Let's go. Shinda, here's 20,000 rupees. I'll give you 180,000 as soon as you give me the documents. Lalaji, I am selling my house. If you could give me some more money? Shinda, this isn't a house. This is just a piece of land. No one will give you the money I am giving you. Heed my advice, take this money and start your own business. Listen, you got hyper when I asked you to sell my house. You didn't take much time to sell your house. How is it fair? Try to understand, Balli. You should have seen how happy Lali's father was.. ..when he knew we bought a shop. If this works out then I am sure he will certainly think and me and Lali. That's why he has invited me for tea. I can do anything for Lali. We will go and tell Seth that we have arranged for 200,000 rupees. I have sold my house. We will somehow arrange for the rest 50,000 as well. - Right? - Okay. I am very happy today. I too am very happy for you, brother. - Wait. - What happened? - Janu. - It must be Lali. She must be asking what time will I come home in the evening. Hello? Balli! Simran! Come soon! - What happened, Gurmeet? - She fell. Balli, our Simran! Don't worry, Gurmeet. - Where is she? - Inside. My daughter! The tumour in her stomach has expanded. Doctor said just medicines won't be enough now. We will have to get her operated. We need 200,000 rupees. We don't have that kind of money, Gurmeet. Sister-in-law, ask doctor to prepare for the operation. - We'll arrange for the money. - Yes. Come, Balli. What had we thought and what happened, Shinda! Why do you worry? They will operate on Simran within a week's time. Everything will be fine. But the shop? You sold your house for it. Stupid, to marry the girl you love and to set up your business comes later. The most important thing is the life of a loved one. I am happy that my house got sold for a good deed. - Hello? - Hello, Shinda? Lali. - Lali? - Shinda, why didn't you come? Daddy is waiting for you. We had to get Balli's daughter admitted in a hospital. Oh God. What happened? - Is everything alright? - Yes, she was unwell. Apologise to uncle on my behalf. - I'll come as soon as I am free. - It's okay. You stay there. By the way, did you give the money to Sethji? - Yes, I gave him 100,000. - Okay. Fine, I'll wait for you. Bye. I don't want any excuses. I was shocked yesterday when the teacher said.. ..you have 100,000 cash on you. It is true, I sold my house to buy the shop. Then where is the money? I told you we had got 20,000. His daughter was unwell. So we had to give it to the hospital. Stop bluffing, guys. Go and check in the hospital if you don't believe us. She is still there. We might be scoundrels, but we won't lie about our daughter. But I am in fix now. Either let me sell the shop because you cannot buy it. You had given us 15 days. You can do anything you want after that. There aren't many days left anyway. I need to deposit some money in the bank. I'll be right back. He goes to the bank to deposit his change every day. Have you ever had an account in the bank? If you had then you would know, I have an overdraft. I need to deposit 15,000-20,000 every week. Go before the bank closes. Keep them back. Go, go, go! Don't push, Inspector. You'll get into trouble. I am yet to push you. If I do, you won't remain standing. Let's go. Get him in. Hey! Stay back! Get him in. Go. Come on. Stay back! Yes, sir? Brother, is the bank closed because of Sukhchan? No Mr. Mohanlal, bank officers are on strike today. They have nothing else to do. They keep going on strikes. - Hello, sir. - Hello. Hello. He is a liar. I trusted him because of you. Seth too lashed out at me. I have made this decision after due consideration. This boy isn't right for you. Who lies to their loved ones, Shinda? I even sold my house for the shop, Lali. Balli's daughter fell ill. There is nothing I could do. I am out of luck here. No matter what I tell daddy now, he will think that I am lying. I tried so hard to form a good image of you in front of daddy. After he met the manager, he doesn't even want to hear about you. But you understand, don't you? That I did the right thing? Why don't you hold my hand? Why are you staring at me? I am just asking for her hand. Shinda.. Shinda! Never mess with a Jatt's girlfriend. If you ever do, never do it in front of the Jatt. If you ever want to do it in front of the Jatt.. ..then check his mood first. Because Jatt likes to break some bones.. ..when he is in a bad mood. Brother, we are not with them. We just took a lift from them. We will go with someone else. Let's go. Come on. I can die for you. And I can kill for you. So, a shop isn't a big deal. "Your beauty has become the talk of the town." "The money you spend makes me frown." "Your beauty has become the talk of the town." "The money you spend makes me frown." "You end up killing me.." "..when you get on the roof to see me." "Your gait is a killer too." "You keep embroidering your dresses.." "Why don't you embellish my dress too?" "You keep embroidering your dresses.." "Why don't you embellish my dress too?" "You are beautiful like the Heer.." "I am crazy about thee." "I am crazy about thee." "I am crazy about thee." "You are beautiful like the Heer.." "I am crazy about thee." "Make me your beloved." "Your brothers too will accept me as a buddy." "Form a relationship with me." "You keep embroidering your dresses.." "Why don't you embellish my dress too?" "You keep embroidering your dresses.." "Why don't you embellish my dress too?" 'Court has sent Sukhchan on a seven day remand.' 'Police was ordered to investigate his accompanists too.' 'They should find out where Sukhchan is hiding the 500 million rupees.' You love to run away, don't you? I'll soon make you run for your life. I'll fulfill all your desires. You fulfill all your desires soon, Inspector. You won't be able to find me again. You will get out.. ..only after you finish the punishment government gives you. If that doesn't happen then I am not my father's son. No. Don't make such claims, Kuldeep Singh. 50 million is a huge sum. You won't be able to earn it in your lifetime. Take it and get me out of here. You can blame it on someone's stupidity. You are right. I can take the money. But I still haven't stooped so low.. ..that I'll take it from you. - Baint? - Yes? Come here. He will be sentenced in within a week's time. He will soon leave. Take such good care of him.. ..that no one should know whether he sighs.. ..because of our hospitality or piles. Okay, sir. Don't take the money if you don't want to, Inspector. Those who want me out.. ..must have already made the layout of your police station by now. - Give him some tea and stuffed flatbread. - Yes, sir. With pickles? Balli, what do you think, what will be his sentence? He stole government's money. He will be given a harsh punishment. It is government's fault. They don't make proper arrangements. They are bound to steal. Look at our bank for example. Anyone can rob it anytime. Stop your nonsense. We don't come here to talk about robbery. Brother, who else do I share my feelings with if not you? - You don't talk, you bluff. - Yes. We have been inside the bank. You told us about the 5-feet tall walls. But you didn't mention the door beyond that. It is a wooden door, its wood is weak. A dog managed to get through it yesterday. We got it reinforced by a carpenter. I am sure the carpenter must have done a good job. How can anyone break open that door now? I told you that the wood is weak. You can literally scrape your way in through the door. There are just three employees inside. You can make them stand in a corner by showing them a gun. You can steal all the money. No one outside will have a clue about what's going on inside. Hello! Moreover, this gun doesn't work either. - But you can hit them with this gun. - Yes. I am a peon, I offer people tea, I don't hit them. Don't make me disclose all secrets. Let some things remain a secret. It's no longer a secret, you stupid. You have told us everything. Don't worry, Khundi, no one will rob your bank. I know your gun doesn't work. But you can shout and call the policemen, right? Here's another secret. - Come closer. - Do you want us to sit on your lap? Listen to me. When there is lunch break in the bank.. All the staff members makes me serve them tea and lunch. By the time I get to eat, the lunch break is over. I come out to have lunch after the lunch break. Anyone can rob the bank during this time. Balli!' 'Take the money! We have faced enough of poverty.' 'Come on. Damn you, Manager! Come. I'll kill you. I am just a peon, no one will pay heed to me. They will say this when something untoward happens. "Yes, Khundi was right." 'Consider the bank robbed then, Khundi.' "The young man is going around in full form." "The young man will become James Bond today." "The young man is going around in full form." "The young man will become James Bond today." "He is being talked about everywhere." "He roams around in one area." "With great courage and no fear" "Today the robbers are going to loot." "With great courage and no fear" "Today the robbers are going to loot." "With great courage and no fear" "Today the robbers are going to loot." The well, the village square, the dispensary.. ..the police station and the bank. Wow, you arranged for this so soon? I have been in this village since 38 years. I know all these places as the back of my hand. According to Khundi this door won't last more than two kicks. Because it is at the back no one will get a sound when it's broken. That is fine, Shinda. Just give it another thought. Do we really need to rob a bank to get the money? We aren't doing it for money. We are doing it for Lali's love. Why don't you just say that you want to embarrass the bank manager. You can take it as you like. Then consider it robbed, Shinda. Shinda along with friends does this work. 25 villages are with you. 25 villages are scared of you. Shinda has power of explosives in him. I'll show you how to break the bank's door. We will both run towards it at full speed. And kick on the door. Have knives in your pocket even if you are attacked with sword. It's quite windy out here. I'll hold the door, you kick it. Have knives in your pocket even if you are attacked with sword. I'll lift my hand as you approach. Give me a signal when you come. The eyes of heart is watching you. Where is he? Why hasn't he come as yet? With courage he is going to loot. I am so dead, Shinda! With courage he is going to loot. Stand up. I'll come back. Fine. Balli, that's the village police station and that's the bank. And these are the tiny lanes of the village. If we get separated while running.. ..we will go and hide at the shed. Now the most important thing. You will go dressed as a female for this robbery. Are we going to rob a bank or for a dance? Try to understand. - Police will think that a man and a woman robbed the bank. - Okay. They will be their suspects. No one will look for us. Take a worn-out dress from your wife and prepare for the robbery. - See you later. - Okay. The young man is going around in full form. Why are you home so early? - I needed something. - What do you want? Do you have any old dress and ornaments? Why? A priest told me that if we give your old dress and ornaments.. ..to a poor person then it will be good for our business. Strange, there are people even poorer than us? Wait, I'll give it to you. What's my baby doing? I am studying. Here, take it. Hold it. Let me put it. You are dropping half the things. You will only get half the benefits. Oh God, please help us. Sir, your lunch. Okay. Listen, get me some pickle as well. Madam, your tea. I'm going for lunch. Okay. - Meshi, make me some tea. - I'm making it. Have a seat. I am leaving. I'll shoot the person who moves. Parvati, close the door. Parvati, close the door. Stupid, you are Parvati. - Sorry, sweetheart. - Dacoits? Do we look like angels to you? Where's the cash? - With Pushpa. - Who is Pushpa? Who is Pushpa? I asked who is Pushpa! - Raise your hand. - Sir, I. Don't come here, Pushpa. Just give me the cash. This is not right. - I'll shoot you. - Oh, God! Parvati, take the cash from Pushpa. - Come on. Come on. - Let's go. - Come on! - Hey! No, brother. - Remove the money. - Oh, God. - Give me the money. - Here you go. - How much is it? - Rs. 80,000. 80,000? Do you think we have nothing else to do? You want us to come back? It's under you. Oh! Oh, my God, take it out. - Rs. 50,000. - 50! 80 and 50, 130. 30! - 160. - Brother.. And 20. That's just 180. - I'll lose my job, brother. - I want Rs. 2,50,000. That's all we have. Ujagar, they only have 180. Kill Pushpa. She will make sure you will get Rs. 250,000. No, Parvati. That's all we have. How will give you Rs. 250,000? You.. You better don't interfere. I'll get you married. Ujagar, brother, what does this robbery have to do with my marriage? Ujagar, sweetheart, we have nothing to do with this. Don't get us into trouble by talking about marriage. Sir? Why have you closed the door from inside? - It's not closing time yet. - Hey! We have information that there are Rs. 250,000 rupees in the bank. Give us the right amount or else I will shoot you. - We gave you what we had. - Yes. We really don't have it. I swear. If you don't believe it then you can search us. - Madam! - How can I search you? It's not right. - Hello! Not one is listening. - Sister can. Okay, no problem. Parvati, concentrate on what we came here to do. We don't have time to waste. 180 isn't enough for us. Give us 250 or else.. - Damn you. - Yes. Manager sir! Open the door, I am waiting. I don't understand.. ..which idiot told you that there is Rs. 250,000 rupees in the bank. - Some bloody smart.. - Madam? - What? "- Open the door!" He has been shouting from quite some time now. Police can show up anytime now. Stay back! Stay back! Stay back! Open the door, I am waiting! - What are you doing? - Open the door! You! What are you doing? Manager sir! - Manager can't do anything. - Ujagar, that gun doesn't work. Use our gun. Put your hands down. Come closer. You scoundrel, you lie to people that there is 250,000 rupees in the bank. They don't even have Rs. 2,00,000. I swear, I never said that. You keep telling everyone. I want 250! I'll kill everyone! No, brother! We gave you all we had. We don't have anymore. I am telling the truth. I swear. Ujagar, please listen to me. I won't listen to anyone. You will have to. Can't we make do with 180? We cannot. We need 240. We are still short of 60. We need 240. Ujagar, why don't you come back later? - Do you think we are fools? - Yes. You want us to get arrested by coming back here? No. Let go of my hand. We can do one thing. It's 03:25pm right now. People deposit money till 4 o'clock. We will open the gate and let the depositors in. You will get the rest of the money. Don't worry. Yes. Security guard! Open the gate and spend people inside. If someone comes to withdraw the money.. - ..then you will also lose the 180. - Yes. Send only the depositors. If someone comes to withdraw then say that the bank is out of cash. Do you understand? If you try to act smart.. ..then we know that your gun doesn't work but ours surely does. We will shoot you. - My shoulder hurts. - I know. - How do you know? - We rob banks. We don't have tea in the canteen, stupid. - Parvati! - Yes, Ujagar? Get his gun. Give it to him. Hold my gun. Take the manager inside. If anyone tries to act smart.. ..then he or she won't be able to watch the whole robbery take place. - You.. sit down. - No.. Not there. On your chair. - You aren't at a funeral. - Come on. Sit down. Stand up. How are you, Khundi? - How's your shoulder? - Forget about the shoulder. Just tell me are you here to deposit or withdraw? Withdraw. There is no cash in the bank. Come back tomorrow. Oh I see. So, I'll have to come back tomorrow? No, the manager will come to your home. Fine, I'll come on Tuesday. Madam, I wanted to deposit 5000 rupees. Okay. Here you go. How are you, Khundi? I am fine. Why have you come here? - My child studies in the city. - Okay. I need to pay his fees. I came to withdraw Rs. 35,000. There is no cash in the bank. Come back tomorrow. I didn't ask for 10 million. This is such a useless bank. They don't even have Rs. 35,000. Move aside. We don't have cash, brother. Come back tomorrow. At least let me talk to them. Tomorrow is the last day to pay the fees. Come on. - Sister-in-law, talk to him. - Let us go inside and talk to them. Come inside. Madam, we wanted to withdraw 35,000 rupees. How did you come inside? This is a limit. No one questioned when we wanted to deposit the money. Today when we are here to withdraw our own money.. ..you are asking how did we come inside? Actually, the bank is out of cash. Please come back tomorrow. I want it today. I need to send it to my child. Give it to me from the deposits you collect today. - Sir, please come back tomorrow. - I want the money today. Bloody Khundi is sending people in to withdraw. - Yes, uncle? - I have come to deposit some money. - Go inside. - Let's go and sit there. We will only leave after we get the money. They will not give this way. We have not come to take loan. Ma'am? I want to deposit Rs. 25,000 in the agent's account. 200, 205, 210. We have 210 now. We are still short of 30. Call all those who have an account in this bank.. ..and ask them to deposit some money. Brother, no one will come like this to deposit. People should have money to deposit it. You.. - Open the book. Open it! - I am. Give me the Rs. 25,000 that man just deposited. - I will manage with that much. - How can we give it to you? We need to collect 240 for someone before you. May your bank get doomed. May your bank be robbed. Let's go. It is a cheater bank. You and your bank.. I think you get it. Let's go. To hell with you all. - Hello, Sethji? - Yes, Shinda? That day you weren't able to deposit the money. Make sure you deposit the money in the bank today. How can I go leaving the shop unattended? Where are you two? Sethji, we are stuck doing some important. We heard that you'd be fined if you don't deposit the money today. You should go there. Okay? It's about to be 4 o'clock. Bank won't take any deposits now. They will, for you. At least come here. What are you saying? Not come here, go there. Right. I mean at least go there. Fine, I'll close the shutter and go. 210 and 15. 225. We are still short. Yes? Who do you want to meet? Ujagar, I think the guard fired his gun. Parvati, quickly take the money we have managed to gather. You, sit down. Khundi, you traitor. He told us that the gun doesn't work. He shot 15 bullets from it. Sit! Sit down! Bomb! Bomb! - Let's go. - Hurry up! Hold my hand. - Pushpa. - Pushpa. Save me. Start the jeep! - Quickly sit down, Parvati. - Brother, you had come to rob the bank. - Why are you taking me with you? - Where did you come from? You brought me here by holding my hand. It's just been two minutes, please let me go back. My life will get ruined if anyone finds out about this. Couldn't you speak up sooner? I got scared. But you spoke up now. - If Parvati gets caught inside then we both will be in trouble. - Sweetheart! - Help me. - Come on. - Brother, help me jump across the wall. - Hurry up. Brothers never help sister jump across walls. Push the bike. Sit, Parvati. Move aside. Catch him. Go from that side. Balli! Shinda! Where? Sit down. Come on. This way. We are safe now. Sukhchan. Don't make any noise. - Yes. - Okay. And I won't tell anyone that a man came.. ..to the warehouse shed. Why are you here, brother? My men got me out. Police is searching for me. The police is looking for you? You left the money at the bank? Stupid, you shouldn't raise your hand at a woman. Can you get me out of here? What are you saying, brother? We got out with great difficulty. We cannot. Son, 50 million is a big amount. Think about it. - 50 million? - I'll give you 50 million.. ..if you get me out of here. I'll get you out but reduce the amount. Such a huge sum will cause us a heart attack. Stupid, you shouldn't say no to money. Half the job is already done. You just need to get me out of this village. I'll do something. You stay here. - Brother.. - How are you doing? Shinda! - What happened! - Tell him, that I am a man. It is your fault. Remove the veil from your face. He didn't give me the time. He's a man. Uncle! Uncle, I am taking your cart. It's okay, son. There's fodder in it. You can take it. I'll take it along the fodder and bring it back as it is. Do whatever is feasible for you. Okay, uncle. Let's go, dear. Here. Don't sit on him. Move that way. We are hiding someone over there. Check properly. - Sukhchan shouldn't escape. - Stop the car. Police is checking everyone. I don't think.. ..we will be able to help him leave the village. We shouldn't get into trouble.. ..because of him. Let's go back to the village. Make it believable that just got the fodder. They said that a lot of shots were fired. Did they catch anyone? - Police caught all the goons. - Okay. - But they couldn't get hold of Sukhchan. - Oh no. - Police was saying.. - Yes. ..that Sukhchan is still in the village. They say they will catch him soon. Yes. Police will catch him. They don't spare anyone. They won't let him escape. Right, Jinder? That is the thing, police won't let him escape. He is a scammer. Sukhchan brother, don't even breathe for the next few minutes. We are about to pass through the police station. There are policemen everywhere. This is the only unguarded path. From here we will go directly to my house. Uncle, forget robbing the bank.. ..if they even have an account here.. ..I bet you they will never even come to withdraw money from it. Right, Meshi? I had this knee on his neck. My knee still aches. - I wonder how his neck is doing? - Where were you two? Such a big disaster happened in the village. - What happened? - Both bank and the police station where under attack. Oh, really? When? Not even an hour ago. See, I had told you, this bank can be robbed anytime. It happened just as I had predicted. Tell them. So did they take the money? No, no, no. Will Khundi let that happen? He and the manager caught them, thrashed them and sent them away. You saw that? Khundi told me everything. I had to save the bank. I couldn't leave and just run away. Right? Khundi, do you know who they were? Police will investigate. We didn't let it get robbed. They managed to help Sukhchan escape. Why are you mixing the people.. ..who came for Sukhchan with the people who robbed the bank? - Right. - He had his knee on their neck. Why are you in this cart today? You didn't open your stall today? Uncle Labh asked us to get fodder for him. - That's why. - Yes. Good that you weren't here. Ask Meshi how many bullets were fired. If you were here you would have ran for your life. Enough, Khundi. Stop bluffing. Don't make me get started. Hey! Yes, sir? Move the cart aside. Okay. Move, let's go, dear. Move. Go, go. Sir, this thingy belongs to him. It must have fallen when he was running. Well done. Go, get me some tea. - Baint. - Yes? Yes, sir? Do you think he must have left this area as yet? Just asking. No. - He cannot survive without this, right? - Yes. Inform all the medical stores in this area.. ..that anyone who comes to purchase an asthma pump and not a thingy.. Anyone who comes to purchase an asthma pump.. They should let us know their name, number and address. - Okay? - Okay. - Go now. - Sir. Here's your bottle, brother. My pump? Shops were closed. We will get it tomorrow morning. How will I breathe? Like this. Breathe in from your nose and breathe out like this. I'll slap you. I have asthma. I never know when I'll get an asthma attack. That's when I need the pump. Brother, somehow manage without it tonight. There are no doors in my house anyway. Air comes directly inside. I don't understand, why are you making me stay here. A place which doesn't even have any doors. You will get me into trouble. Brother, you have scammed the government of 500 million rupees. Think about this, will Sukhchan ever stay at a place without doors? - No. - This is what the police will think as well. Don't worry. It's a routine check. I'll go and check. - Baint? - Yes, sir? Take a constable with you and find out who stays there. Okay, sir. Search each and every house. Go. What happened, sir? You know that criminal Sukhchan has escaped. - Oh. Yes, yes. - We want to search your house. He is inside, come in. He is crazy. I too just learn so. We didn't find him, sir. Shall we get in the cars, sir? They left. Are you crazy? You don't even realise what you are saying. I won't stay with you. You will get me into trouble. Calm down, brother. You don't even have your asthma pump. I'll punch you. What were you telling him? Brother, I knew for sure that if I invite him in, he'd never come. I've travelled in buses without a ticket when I couldn't help it. I always used to get caught. Then I came up with a plan. Whenever I used to travel in a bus without a ticket.. ..I used to raise my hand and tell the checker.. "Brother, my ticket is in my pocket." "I am going to sleep. You should check it." No one ever checked it. Brother, police officers and paternal aunt's husband are of the same breed. They never do what they are asked to do. You are very smart. Can't help it. God gave me a bad fate with a sharp mind. Now I am trying to use my mind and change my fate. You can plan whatever you want. But your first plan should about getting me out of here. We are more worried about our 50 million... ..than you are about your 500 million. Enjoy your drink. Come Balli, I'll drop you home. Get the pump first thing in the morning. Don't worry. Consider it done. Got it? Uncle, how could I let them steal from my bank? - I took them to the back room of the bank. - Okay. We didn't fight at all. But still, they we begging me before they left. You should have beaten them up. I had. Son, I am impressed by this feat of yours. Everyone is talking about you. Thank you. Yes. The bank staff is recommending my name.. ..to the government for bravery award. Wow. You can take it. It's my friend. I'll call her back. Okay. Do you know who the robbers were? Whoever they were, they will never come back. Police is investigating. - Yes. - They will soon get arrested. Have some biscuits. Daddy is only praising the manner after yesterday's bank robbery. He is quite impressed by his bravery. If the manager was so brave how did the robbers escape? He wouldn't have let them escape. The bomb targeted at the police station fell in the bank instead. They used that as cover and escaped. Otherwise, the manager wouldn't have let them escaped. Will he say that in a Gurudwara? - Why? Is he lying? - Yes, he is. You say as if you witnessed the robbery. I didn't but you know what someone can or cannot do. Tell your father not to get too influenced by the manager. Daddy would get influenced by you as well. But we never know what you are up to. You still haven't done anything about the shop. How do I tell you? Everything is about to change. Forget a shop, I'll get you a palace. Just get the shop, that will be a palace for me. I can really get a palace. I am no longer the same Shinda. Your father is going after the bank manager. I will open my own bank. We are going to get a lot of money, my love. Let's go. "Whenever I see you, my heart skips a beat." "A glance by you.. shatters me." "You make me fear for my life, this is not right." "You make me fear for my life, this is not right." "You stop me and just ask for my heart.." "You stop me and just ask for my heart, this is not right." "You stop me and just ask for my heart, this is not right." "From the time I have seen you, I feel restless." "The attitude you possesses, my dear.." "You have made me go crazy." "Now all day, I only think about you." "Now my life is dependent on you." "Now my life is dependent on you." "Now all day, I only think about you." "My eyes are intoxicating." "You make my life more beautiful." "My eyes are intoxicating." "You make my life more beautiful." "You steal my heart away.." "You steal my heart away, you smile in such a way." "Now my life is dependent on you." "You stop me and just ask for my heart.." "You stop me and just ask for my heart, this is not right." "Now my life is dependent on you." "Now all day, I only think about you." You keep saying that you will get a lot of money. At least tell me where will you get it from. There is a good man who is helping us. I'll tell you everything once I get the money. You misdialled me. Balli has my phone. It must be him. - Yes, Balli? - Shinda, we have a problem. Police has asked all medicinal shops.. ..to note down the name, address, village, and phone number.. ..if anyone comes to purchase an asthma pump. I hope you didn't give them the details. No, I didn't. We barely escaped, brother. But you should come here immediately. I am coming. What happened? Everything okay? Yes, everything is fine. But I will need to leave. I have some work. I'll see you later. - Shinda? - I'll see you later. - Here you go. - Okay. - Morning, afternoon and evening. - Okay. We can give him the cycle pump to breathe. Why did you bring me all the way to the city? We would get into trouble by purchasing a pump in the village. Yes, what do you want? Brother, I forgot the name of the medicine. I'll tell you as soon as I get a message from home. Okay. - No asthma patient has come as yet. - Keep quiet. Take this. - Brother, give me an asthma pump. - Okay. Here you go. Give me your name, address and telephone number. - Why? - Orders from the police. - Really? - Yes. - Okay then also give me a cough syrup. - Okay. I got a message from home. We need Crocin tablets. - I'll give it. - Brother, what is this? It is for people who have breathing problem. Breathing problems.. Brother! What have you done! Couldn't you keep your hands to yourself? Brother, what have my hands done? It came under my feet. You made me suffer a loss. Don't be angry, brother. We will purchase it, okay? This for the crocin tablets. Okay? Kids at home will play with it. - Take your 20 rupees change. - It's okay. You can keep the change, brother. Why is it so out of shape? - We risked our lives to bring it. - Yes. Okay. Brother, I wanted to ask, by when can we get the money? Don't worry about the money. After I leave the village.. ..one of my men will come and give you the money. But what if your man doesn't show up? Then get me back. You still haven't made me leave the village.. ..and you are already worried about your money. I am promising you.. ..that your money is safe at my home. You will get the money as soon as I leave the village. We can take him from here as well. Lalaji is calling. - Yes, Lalaji? - Where are you, Shinda? When will we register the house? We are stuck in some important work. - We will do it in a few days. - Right. Do it and get your job done. And take your money. Okay. Why do we need to sell the house now? Let us get the money. We will be able to treat Simran and set up a business as well. Why don't you speak a little louder so that all the villagers can hear you? - But I am right, aren't I? - Like hell, you are right. 'Police was looking for Sukhchan at every nook and corner.' 'And Balli and Shinda were trying to find a way..' '..to get Sukhchan out of the village.' Shinda. 1 million. Why do we have to get him out of the village? Let us hand him over to the police. We will immediately get 1 million rupees. He wants the reward! We will get punished for hiding him. Let's go. Brother, this is for you. No, I don't drink on Thursdays. Why? I worship the Murshid Pirs. But you scammed the government of 500 million on a Thursday. Yes. Hey, don't joke about the saints. Brother, I wanted to talk to you about something. Tell me. If you could let us talk to the person who will give us the money..? We poor souls would feel assured. Then we would work harder. - Give me the phone. - Give it here. Yes, brother? Suraj.. You do the role of Ravana so well. Oh thank you, bro. Amazing. I want to go abroad. I am preparing for IELTS. Bye, I'll get going now. I am so tired. I have to work hard all afternoon. Sit. Sit with us for a while, brother. How much money does the Ramleela team give you? Hardly anything. It's a free service. Then why don't you help us as well? We will pay you 100,000 rupees. Why are you lying to me after getting drunk? I told you I am tired. Let me go. Wait, wait, wait. Do you know him? Sukhchan. In short, on Dushera day, we'll make Sukhchan dress up.. ..as Ravana instead of you and help him leave the village. Wonderful. Police is giving a reward of 1 million to catch him. I am not crazy to take 100,000 from you. Like hell police will give you the reward. They don't get salaries for two months at a stretch. True. And these posters were printed by the government. Police didn't even pay the ones who glued them to the walls. They had to pay for the glue too out of their pockets. And you dollars from them. But you won't gain any help if you get only me involved. What if the boy who does my makeup tells everyone? I will charge 200,000 rupees. Otherwise, I will tell everyone. You do Shah Rukh Khan's makeup? He wants 200,000 rupees! I don't know about Shah Rukh Khan. It's very simple. You are giving 100,000 to a nobody. I deserve to get 200,000 rupees. Will you pay or should I tell everyone? Shinda, pay him what he wants. Such people are very unpredictable. He might tell everyone. We will be left with quite a lot even after giving away 300,000. Done. Okay, I'll whatsapp my account number then. Oh yes, you will have to do one more thing. This Ravana interacts with all artists. Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, Angad, Kumbhkaran. With everyone. Okay? Anyone of them could find out that Ravana has changed. That's why you need to get the Ramleela's head as well. So that this thing doesn't get exposed. Take a book and a pen. You keep recording who needs to be paid what. What needs to be paid to whom. 100,000 for Neeta. 100,000 for Mindha. 100,000 for Boota. And 100,000 for Changeda. Sir, if we have to give everyone 100,000.. ..then what's the use of giving you 500,000? I am charging 500,000 so that they stay in check. Or else they might open their mouth even after taking the money. - How much? - 3.7 million. You never donated 5 rupees to them. And now you are giving them millions. They know now. We will get into trouble if we don't pay them. It's just 3.7 million. It's not like we worked hard for it. Brother, what are you two whispering about? Tell us, do we have a deal? You will get the money. You tell us how to go about this. There isn't much to do then. Ask that goon to memorise Ravana's dialogues. I am Lakeshwar! I am a part of the sky! I am a part of the earth! I am a part of the netherworld! What's next? You are at a few more places but I cannot read Sanskrit. If you cannot even read it how do I say it? - Read what's next. - What's next? H-A-H-A.. It's not H-A-H-A, it means laugh like a Ravana. I cannot do this. Find another way. Brother, this is the easiest way. The security is quite tight. Policemen are even checking pregnant buffalos stomach.. ..just in case you are hiding in there. - Right? - Yes. What's next? Is the Ravana ready? - He is getting his makeup done. - Fine. In half an hour Hanuman will come to pick him up. - Shall I drop him? - No, no, no. Ravana will mingle with the Ramleela actors and leave easily. If you drop him then everyone's attention will be on him. You quickly go and get his makeup done. Okay. - Ready? - Yes. Go then. Suraj, we will meet at the city bypass in three hours. Okay? Yes. - Have you taken the costume? - Yes. I have it in the bag. - Okay. - Shall I leave? - Yes. Go, go, go. Hurry up. Balli? Makeup, no one should know who he is.. ..otherwise, everyone will get arrested. I just spent two months in prison. Please don't say such things. You leave and let him do his work confidently. - You continue. - Okay. Keep that down. That sword is as big as him. There are just a few hours left for our poverty to end. I think Hanuman is here. - Hello. - Hello. - Where is he? - Just five minutes. Shinda Singh, what are the Ramleela actors doing in your house? How does it concern you? I have invited them for lunch. You have lunch at other people's home. How can you invite them? My father was Rama's devotee. He used to say that he wants to invite the Ramleela actors for lunch. - I have heard that as well. - Yes. Right, we have to do it for the dead. Yes, you have to do it. So, we are doing it. - Please leave. - Fine. Always seeking hot gossip topic. Fine, we are leaving. Start the scooter, I'll send him in five minutes. - Okay. - Kick-start it. Hurry up. How much more time will it take? We are about to reach, brother. Where are you taking him? He isn't going to survive today. Don't worry, they are talking about the Ravana.. ..we will set on fire today on Dushera. So, what's the arrangement? Sir, 15 guards are on Dushera duty. Six out of them will go with the artists' chariots leaving the village. Why will they be leaving the village? Sir, four villagers come together and arrange this Ramleela. Before they burn the Ravana, each chariot visits one village. All hail Lord Rama! Okay. It will be quite crowded so stay alert. I think he will take advantage of the crowd and try to escape. Who? Sukhchan. - I know. - What? Is everything going according to plan? Don't worry. - Everything is going according to plan. - Leave now. I think they all are came for burn the Ravana. 'All hail Lord Rama!' 'All hail Sita Mata!' 'All hail Hanuman!' 'All hail Ravana!' - Be alert, Baint. - Yes, sir. I am watching every moment, sir. I have two cameras recording everything as well. According to the list provided by the head of the committee.. ..they have 22 actors and 31 backstage help. - Did you count them? - Yes, sir. I have a guard there as well. I have counted them. 'To keep supporting us so that we can keep entertaining the villagers.' 'All hail Lord Rama!' Lakshwar, your time is up. The only punishment you deserve it death. Nothing else. 'All hail Lord Rama!' Rama, Lakeshwar was immortal, is immortal and will stay immortal. He will stay immortal! Lakeshwar will always remain immortal! 'All hail Lord Rama!' 'All hail Lord Rama!' All hail Lord Rama! All hail Lord Rama! - Sir? - Yes? - You tell me. - What? Hail to... Egoistic Ravana, it is not your fault. God doesn't want this clan in this world. That's why it is certain that you will die today. And it is bound to happen. How dare you! How dare you! Sir! Move aside. - Don't fight. - Leave him. Listen to me. Here he comes. He is here to pee. At least wait for him to finish peeing. One, two, three four, five. Go. You did a good job. You should leave from here. Brother, our money? One of my men will come and pay you. Don't worry about the money. You should leave from here. But I need the money right now. Please trust me. Don't worry about the money. You should leave from here. - Go, go, go. - Don't forget. All hail Lord Rama! Sir, this is yesterday's report from the chemist shops. Sir. 16 pumps were sold in 41 shops in the area. - Baint! - Yes, sir. Are you checking the records of the shops? Yes. Of course. It is right. All those who bought the pumps are undergoing treatment. We have also enquired about a new purchase. I personally did it. He has asthma. How do you know that? Sir, we woke him up and made him run. He was out of breath. We gave him the pump and he felt better. I don't understand. How can a person like Sukhchan survive for five days without his asthma pump? Sir, we reached five days' records. - Okay. - Everything else is fine. A shop owner wrote a name and then cancelled it. Why? Sir, a customer asked for it by mistake. He later said he wanted something else. That's why I deleted his name. 'Actually, there was some misunderstanding by my wife.' 'We need a medicine for an allergy.' And who was this customer? Balli, from our village. He has a mobile repair shop. Sir, we have sold 16 pumps so far. Here is the list. There are only 15 people in this list. Sir, one customer was playing with the pump. He broke it. Then he had to buy it. - Do you know him? - No, I don't know him. But I can recognise him if he comes before me. Idea. Show him Balli's photo. Okay, sir. Yes, sir. It was him. There was another man with him. Sir, Shinda is always with Balli. It might be him. He is the one, sir. They don't look like criminals. Sir, usually the ones who look innocent do such things. Get into the jeep. Yes, yes. Move in. Come on, everyone. Let's go. - Some of you go upstairs and check. - Okay, sir. - Check this room. - Okay, sir. - Find out if it's the kitchen or what? - Okay, sir. - Two of you go there. Go. - Okay, sir. - You, go upstairs. - Okay. Hurry up. Come on. Sir. Yes? Why did you take so long to open the door? My daughter is unwell. That's why. - Where is Balli? - What happened? Where is Balli? He wasn't at his stall today. He must be here somewhere. He said he would go for the Dushera His daughter is unwell and he wants to visit the fair? He must be on his way back. He said he had come important work. He will come back soon. Hello. Sir, the Ramleela's chariots came back as they had left. We have called their head here. He said he will come here as soon as they set the Ravana on fire. Do you know Balli and Shinda? Yes, I know. Since when are they associated with Ramleela? Since two days? Why did they join the troupe? I don't know, sir. I came after two days. But one thing is surely surprising. They used to never even donate 10 rupees. Why are they going around with the Ramleela actors? Sir, let's go to the Dushera ground and get them. It's quite late. They all must have set the Ravana on fire and left. You will find them all at the Ramleela club now. Sir, please try to understand. We aren't going anywhere. We will pay you as soon as Sukhchan's man gives us the money. We trusted him. You should trust us. Don't just say hmm, say something. Suraj, we have been in this village since so many years. Have we ever done anything wrong? Except for helping Sukhchan. Let's leave quickly. Why leave? Let's resolve this issue. - Police. - Oh damn. Please handle the situation, brother. What happened? Where are Balli and Shinda? They were here. They just left. You are the head? What? Yes, sir. Yes. - Where is Sukhchan? - What? Who? Who is Sukhchan? The one you help get out of the village. We are telling the truth, sir. We don't know any Sukhchan. Okay? - Oh, I see. - Yes. No problem, sir. I have recorded everything in the camera. Very good, Baint. - Thank you, sir. - It's okay. - Get them all into the jeeps. - Yes, sir. Let's steal their happiness and peace of mind at least. Yes, sir. Stop right here. - Rewind it. - Okay. Before that. - Yes, pause it. - Okay. - Who is Ravana? - What? Suraj, sir. Take him inside and show him the sun, the moon.. ..the stars and the whole universe. Okay, sir. Let's go. Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Sir! Sir, please let me go. I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you the truth. I am not alone. All of us are involved. - Where is Balli? - I don't know. I keep calling him but he isn't answering. Our daughter is seriously ill. We just called for the institute's ambulance. Take her. Sir. Shinda didn't come to his house. Balli too didn't come to his house. Search the whole village. Okay, I'll do something. Who was it? Lalaji, the one whom I sold my house told. Police is looking for us. What had we thought that what happened. - Everything is over. - Why do you worry? Take my motorcycle, get Gurmeet and Simran and leave the village. - What about you? - Why do you worry about me? I'll join you later. You should first think about your family. - I won't leave without you. - I'll slap you. I told you, leave! Take the phone. Go. I said leave. 'Neither did Sukhchan's man come here nor did the money.' 'Balli and Shinda keep hiding here and there to escape the police.' Hello, Gurmeet? Balli, where are you? I am outside the house. Where are you? I am at the hospital. Our daughter's condition got worse. Come here as soon as possible. - You two keep an eye there. - Look over there. Get him! Don't let him escape. Come on, let's get him. Stop! Yes. Okay. Yes, okay. Sir, we have managed to trace Shinda and Balli's phone numbers. Both of them were found entering the Moga city together. Then both their phones where switched off. I want to talk to the station in-charge of the Moga police station. Okay, sir. What is wrong? Why are you late today? What do I say, sir? There is a problem in our village. What problem? - Sukhchan who had escaped from our village.. - Yes? Balli and Shinda had helped him escape. - Shinda? - Yes. Where the hell is Balli? He has switched off his phone. Hello? Lali, it's me Shinda. Yes, tell me. Lali, I wanted to tell you something. I too wanted to tell you something. Don't call me ever again, Shinda. - Listen to me, Lali. - No, Shinda. I always listened to you. It's okay. I just wasted some time of my life. But I learnt a lot from you. One should never trust anyone. - Lali, I.. - Police is tracking your phone. They are perhaps also tracking mine. Don't call me up ever again. You have made me break our relationship. Now at least let me honourably marry someone else. Lali.. Lali! "The instrument of fate.." "Drowned so close to the shore." "Why, God?" "Oh God.." "The instrument of fate.." "Drowned so close to the shore." "I lived for no reason.. on its support." "Dreams that break easily.." "Dreams which cannot be mended back together.." "No one should have such dreams." "No one special should ever come into my life, oh God." "If one comes, then should never leave, oh God." "If someone intends to make me cry later.." "Then that person shouldn't make me laugh, oh God." "No one special should ever come into my life, oh God." "Shattered pieces of my heart, take your name." "Shattered pieces of my heart, take your name." "You paid me no heed." "You didn't take pity on me." "I had to endure the pain of separation alone." "It is difficult to survive." "My heart weeps day and night." "No one should trouble me so much, oh God." "No one special should ever come into my life, oh God." "If one comes, then should never leave, oh God." "If someone intends to make me cry later.." "Then that person shouldn't make me laugh, oh God." "No one special should ever come into my life, oh God." "Oh God.." "My Lord.." Where are you, Balli? I keep hiding here and there. Shinda, Simran is unwell. She has been hospitalised. Her condition is very critical. Don't worry. We will do something. Do whatever you have to, brother. But I will go to the hospital to meet my daughter. I don't care if the police arrests me. Balli, there is only one way to redeem from the mistake we made. We'll have to capture Sukhchan and hand him over to the police. But where will we find him? We will have to do something, Balli. We cannot fight with God for giving us a bad fate. We will have to fight with fate. Forget about fate. I read in the newspaper that police didn't even spare the Ramleela artists. Take care of yourself. I am hanging up now. Lali was saying that they are tracking our phones. Trying to escape the police? Where's your partner? I got separated from Shinda in the village itself. You are lying. Get him in the jeep and search his house as well. Okay, sir. He says they got separated in the village itself. In the phone tracking your numbers place you at the same place. We have two sims in one phone. I'll teach you a lesson on that in the police station. Hold him. 'I don't drink on Thursdays.' 'Why?' 'I worship the Murshid Pirs.' 'Shinda was on his way to Murshid Pirs' shrine..' '..when fate made him see him on the way itself.' Quickly, quickly. Turn around. Follow them. Stop here. Thank you very much, brother. Thank you. Bye. Brother is here. - Come on, hurry up. - Okay. We don't have much time. - Okay, brother. - Hey! Shinda! What are you doing here, Shinda? After getting you out of the village.. ..police learnt that we helped you leave the village. We got into trouble, brother. That is indeed very bad. That's why I thought there is only one way to rectify my mistake. I should take you back to the police station. Only then will we get rid of this trouble. Don't joke. We have done so much for you, brother. Can't you do even this much for us? We will get you out again. Now we know how to that quite well. You have lost your mind. Son, give him a few hundred thousands. He'll get himself treated. You had agreed to pay us 50 million, brother. Take whatever you are getting and leave. My mother used to say that I am quite hot-tempered. So, I shouldn't fight. That's why I am being polite with you. Please come to the police station with me. Otherwise, I'll have to go against my mother. Have you seen these men? Is that all of them? Or do I have to thrash more? What are you waiting for now? Go ahead and turn him black and blue. Never abuse a Jatt. If you ever do, never do it in front of the Jatt. If you ever want to do it in front of the Jatt then check his mood first. Because Jatt likes to break some bones when he is in a bad mood. Look, with all intent and honesty.. ..we arrested a very dangerous criminal Sukhchan. Yes. But two people from your village.. ..for their own personal greed helped him escape from the police station. One of them is Balli, who got arrested. - The other one is.. - SHO sir! Shinda with Sukhchan? He caught him. Your culprit, SHO sir. Arrest him! We made a very big mistake, sir. But what can we say, we were helpless. All this happened because of me. Instead, Balli told me where Sukhchan is hiding. He is innocent. He actually deserves a reward. His daughter is unwell. Please let him go. Baint, take his statement. - Okay, sir. - Release the other guy. Okay. 'Shinda was sentenced three months of imprisonment..' '..for giving refuge to Sukhchan.' 'And Balli was let go scot-free.' 'Sukhchan was sentenced seven years imprisonment..' '..for selling government land.' 'The headman and the lank clerk who helped him..' '..were sentenced three years imprisonment.' You know that criminal Sukhchan has escaped. Oh. Yes, yes. He is inside, come in. If I were Sukhchan, I would hide here. What will you get, sir? A promotion? Sukhchan is giving us 50 million to get him out of this village. If we join hands, we can get our hands on the 500 million. 250 each. No matter how many promotions you get.. ..you will never be able to make this kind of money. Oh really? You have a lot of courage. Do you think you can get to his 500 million? It might sound too far reached.. ..but I only say what I can do. Sir, no one is here. No one is here either. Shall we get in the cars, sir? 'And Balli was let The records of all chemists.. ..of this agree don't just go to me.. SSP gets a copy as well. Now have to come up with a plan about how.. ..you will get the pump and from where. Okay? - On Dushera.. - Yes? You can do whatever you want in the name of security. But stay away from the Ramleela. Get out of the village as soon as you can. Ramleel's head told us everything. Balli got the 1 million as promised. Now tell me where our money is. There is a Fortuner parked in my house. There is 20 million on its back seat. Thank you. Thank you very much. I am greatful. SHO sir? Before we divide the money.. ..we need to give 3.7 million to the Ramleela actors. You could manage to get only 20 million from the 500 million. And you want me to share that as well? I couldn't hide more than 20 million in the car. I thought I'll come later and take it. I didn't know that the godown would catch fire. Now let's share and make do with what we got. Have you ever wailed in self-pity? What? I have. I still do, sometimes. - What do you mean? - I got you 1 million. What more do you want? Forget about the 3.7 million for those Ramleela actors. That's settled. They won't cause trouble. Okay? Oh yes, don't be disheartened thinking that you lost 100 million. Look at me, I lost 230 millions. Fate. A very bad fate.. SHO has. 'Shinda new that SHO would cheat him with the money.' 'That's why he had already made the arrangement for that.' CBI. Lali's father wouldn't budge. But I met him and told him everything. As to why you did all this. And the way you mended our mistake.. ..by getting Sukhchan arrested worked in your favour. - I love you like crazy. - I know. Tell me, when are you going to meet my daddy? For what? To talk about our relationship. Stop it! What relationship? That time is long gone. Now I will directly come to marry you. But when? I just need to do one last thing. As soon as I finish that. Now your Shinda isn't the same person he used to be. I am different now. You won't ever stop bluffing, will you? Balli! She says we are bluffers. Thank you, sister-in-law. So, did it work out? Of course, it had to. Shinda, you don't believe it. This 1 milion reward money has changed our lives. Simran got treated. We bought a shop. Moreover, the bank which we wanted to rob.. ..at the moment we have the maximum deposit in it. We will never be able to spend it all. Poor man, you will never think big. That's why God never gives you a lot. Come on, be grateful that Sukhchan didn't give us 50 million. If he had, I would have had a heart attack right away. God saved me. I wanted to tell you something important. Now I fear that you might get an attack if I tell you. No, tell me. We have a lot of money now. I can always get a stunt planted. Okay then, listen carefully. Shinda, I have 500 million. Let me go and we will spilt it between us. You refused to give me 50 million. So why would you give me 250? All of them have money in them? Yes. How much? 480 million. Shinda, the day my daughter was born I knew it right away.. ..that our bad days won't last for long now. We.. We won't be able to take so much money in a motorcycle. We cannot in a motorcycle. But I know in what we can. In village, police baton-charged at the teachers' rally. You two keep wasting time in the cart. Do you know what frauds people have been doing? What happened? Some Purshotam scammed government of 1000 million rupees and ran away. Yes. You cannot be big by doing scams. You need to work hard for it. You need to drive carts. Right, Balli? Yes. Go, go, go. Balli, find out who this Purshotam is. "Your beauty has become the talk of the town." "The money you spend makes me frown." "Your beauty has become the talk of the town." "The money you spend makes me frown." "You end up killing me.." "..when you get on the roof to see me." "Your gait is a killer too." "You keep embroidering your dresses.." "Why don't you embellish my dress too?" "You keep embroidering your dresses.." "Why don't you embellish my dress too?" "You are beautiful like the Heer.." "I am crazy about thee." "Make me your beloved." "Your brothers too will accept me as a buddy." "Make me your beloved." "Your brothers too will accept me as a buddy." "Form a relationship with me." "You keep embroidering your dresses.." "Why don't you embellish my dress too?" "You keep embroidering your dresses.." "Why don't you embellish my dress too?"
