Ah... We set records for the school. Tommy at quarterback, me at end. When I couldn't rent a limo for senior prom Tommy rented a pick-up truck. Same year, same colour as mine. He was more than my friend. He was my idol. He was more than a corporate lawyer. He was a generous man who gave his time to any cause that needed him. I loved Tommy Heaton. I can honestly say, he was the man I wanted to be. And I don't look forward to a world without him. That was very moving. These look just about finished. Claire? Freesias. My favourite. And they still smell great. Can you take them away please? Don't you think it's hard, Rafe? Going through all his stuff like this? Very hard. He was 34 years old. How could he have a heart attack? It happens, sometimes. Yeah. "Spencer Van Allen. Madrid." Who did Tommy know in Spain? What are you looking for? I'm sorry, Jane. I'm the executor of Tommy's will so I got to pull all his papers together. - He was seeing someone? - Could be. He was being pretty close-mouthed lately. If he was seeing someone, be involved with someone and not tell me about it? Strange... You're late, Marino. I know, I'll make it up to you. I'll pick up the check. Yeah, it's your turn anyway. Here I was trying to sweep off your feet. That hasn't worked since high school. Have you ever seen anything like this? Explicit little suckers. Maybe it's a new way to pick up men. "If you'd like to sin, bare skin and a grin, meet me at the beach 6:00 a.m. Thursday." She sends this seductive stuff to a stranger? - Enterprising. - Gutsy. That kind of mystery would have done it for Tommy. But not you? You wouldn't be tempted to call that number? Never. Besides, you just get a fax tone. And the number's unlisted. Not for a cop. Do it. I'm curious. Hello? Are you Tommy Heaton's friend? Yeah. I saw you at his funeral. I'm Laura Clifford. I'm Rafe Marino. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. Um, how do you know Tommy? It's a small town. Same dinner parties, same charities. He actually was on the committee for the gala at the tennis club. I just joined, and all they tell are Tommy stories. So, last year he actually recruited an Appalachian jug band. He felt that the members should be open to all sorts of music. That sounds like Tommy. Well... It was nice to see you again. Oh yeah. Nice to see you. - Bye. - Bye. What took you so long? It's none of your business. This is Tommy Heaton. No one's here to take your call. Leave a message at the beep. Thank you. This is Tommy Heaton. No one's here to take your call. Leave a message at the beep. Thank you. Hello? Gloria! Hey! Sorry. I'm on my way. Hey, Rafe! Long time no see! Hey, how you doin', Anthony? You too good for the old neighborhood? Yeah, right. Here you go, buddy. Saturday afternoon at the park, we could use you! I'll show up one of these days. You're on. All right, see you later! Gloria! Here, come on! Let me do that. You said 10:00. I'm sorry, I overslept. Hey, when was the last time this place was cleaned? Any luck running down those notes Tommy made? Yeah. I made some calls. Somebody's following up on that guy Spencer Van Allen for me. Oh, did you check out the fax number for me? - Yeah, I got the address. - Well, great! I don't know if I should give it to you though. You're gonna go there, aren't you? You are. I'm curious. He knew her, so you gotta? That's got nothing to do with it. Sure it does. You're still trying to climb into that world. And you're still putting it down. No, I'm not! Yeah, you are. - I'm not - You are. You wanna go? Oh! Jesus! The person you are just might be better than the one you're trying so hard to become. - Hi. - Hi. Can I help you? I'm a friend of Tommy Heaton's. I'm listening. - You knew him? - Um-hmm. I assume you know he died suddenly. Yes. I heard. I wasn't sure you had. I didn't see you at his funeral. Why would I go? We never met. I knew who he was though. Anyone else here know who he was? Just what is it that I can do for you? Tommy Heaton got some faxes from this number. I'd like to find out who sent them. That means you know? It means I'm bored. Before you slip into a coma, could you search your consciousness for the name of someone else here he might have known? Sorry. Think about it... Hilary. OK, I've reached everyone in the family. I'm still waiting to hear from his sister. What time's my deposition? 2:00. OK. I'm going over to Tommy's. I need to pick up some papers before I meet with them tomorrow. Can I duck out early? I've got this memorial service at noon. Anybody close? My doctor died about a month ago. He had a sudden heart attack. His family's scattered all over the world so they waited until now to have the service. That's too bad. I know. Dr. Van Allen was the best. Who? Van Allen. Any relation to Spencer Van Allen? That's him. Do you mind if I tag along? Queen of the funeral set. This is her second one today. Like, my mother and her friends go to all the funerals in town. You know, Van Allen was a young man. Too young. That's Bob Burgess, Van Allen's partner. Oh... How long were they partners for? Five, six years, I think. He's a nice guy. Hmm. Excuse me, Donna. My wife and I knew him for a long time. - We... - Um, Doctor Burgess? I'm Rafe Marino. Could I speak to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Excuse me. I was told that doctor Van Allen died of a heart attack. Yeah, believe it or not, that was it. Very sudden. They found him, of all places, in his hot tub. I know, I asked him. Burgess said he'd see if Van Allen got faxes like the ones I found here at Tommy's. Just don't jump to conclusions. Jump to conclusions? This is the first thing that makes any sense to me. You know, Tommy's death sure makes no sense. Tommy keeping secrets from me makes no sense. So, the fact that finding this guy's name on a piece of paper in Tommy's house and then finding out that this guy died? That's the first thing that makes any sense to me. And you think what? There's some connection? Some kind of conspiracy? Well, look. I sure don't believe in coincidence anymore. You think Tommy is leaving you messages from the grave? It would have been easier just to pick up the phone. He tried, Glor. Remember I was in Japan that month before he died. But because the time difference, we never managed to hook up. Come on, Rafe. If it was that important, he would have made contact. Maybe you're right. But Tommy did say what he wanted to talk about was too complicated to leave on voice mail. And knowing him, he probably figured he could handle things until we spoke. OK. You know what? You wanna follow this, then do it. Just don't go crazy, all right? - Me? - Yeah, you. Never. Bye. I know this great Appalachian jug band. Well, hi! Hi. Have a seat. Thank you. Wow, that is so weird seeing you twice in one week at two funerals and a tennis club! And the restaurant. And the restaurant. Yes. Did you know that Van Allen guy well? No. No. He treated my sister when she was in town. He was very sweet to her so I felt the need to pay my respects. Tommy introduced me to a whole different world. And then made me believe I could live in it. Of course I taught him how to make a mean lasagna. You know... By the time we finished law school he was dangerous with a head of garlic. You know, I... I go to call him a million times a day. I'm sorry. So tell me, you lived in a big ranch in Texas? What, like the Ewings? Yeah, it was pretty big. That must be a nice way to live. It was. Until my father died. And then everything changed. The simplicity was gone. And then we moved to Dallas and all I wore was party dresses and I never got back on a horse again. Hmm. To changing that. Cheers. Mr. Marino, Dr. Burgess on two. Hi, Dr. Burgess? Hi. Did you find any faxes at Dr. Van Allen's? Would you mind reading it to me? Yeah, that's the same one I found. Is there a return number on the top? 555-0137. Great. Thanks. Burgess found the same fax, Gloria. They were seeing the same woman. I'm gonna try to get the death certificates. Both of them. Good, then we'll see if there's anything else they have in common. The delivery men promised to be there by 5:00. Call me if they're late. I'm just looking for an excuse... I'm just gonna... I'll call you back. You again. I asked. No one knew your friend. How about Spencer Van Allen? Anyone know him? Another name. What's this, a game show? No game. I'm looking for someone who knew those men. - What do I get if I win? - A place in heaven. We do this once, can we get it over with? If I get the answers I need. There's 5 people who work here. James and Ricardo. Two men. That sound about right? Didn't think so. Eloise, our bookkeeper. She's 60. He likes them old? That brings us to me and Ellen. Like I said, there's not many people here... Who's Ellen? Antonelli. She just left. I saw her. When's she due back? Tommy Heaton? Spencer Van Allen? You know either of these guys? Do I want to know them? They're both dead. Oh. I guess not. So, why do you think I knew them? Somebody at your office knew them. Pretty well, it seems. I'm just trying to find out who. Well, talk to Hilary. I already did. She says it wasn't her. How long have you worked here? Let me see. How long have I worked here? A couple of years. Three, I think. Since I got back from Italy. Vacation? I went for two weeks. Met a sexy Italian and stayed 3 years. Spontaneous woman. Karma. Karma? And when my grand-father died I needed a fresh start. And of course, there was the inheritance. And your family, where are they? Well, my mom left Texas when my Daddy died. She moved to Europe. And your sister? What about my sister? Where does she live? Everywhere. She loves to travel. Oh, eat this. How come you're not married to one of those tycoons? Because I'm very... very selective. I'm very, very lucky. They said they'd put me on the stand first. Last time they get a favour from me. Did you find out anything yet? Not even hello? Come on, Gloria. I don't have time to argue with you. This is what I know: I pulled both reports on both deaths. Both had heart failure. Both had alcohol in their systems. Could be the combination of alcohol and the very hot water. Coincidence, but logical. I don't buy it. Why not? Because they dated the same woman. It happens. Not to my friend. It's the defiant part of you that I like best. Does that mean you'll help me? Don't I always? A Jack Tucker sent over an application for you to fill out. Who's Jack Tucker? He said he's president of Laurelmount Tennis Club. Don't know him. Well, he wants you to fill it out. For their files, he said. He messengered it over. Yeah. Can I speak with Jack Tucker? Hi, Jack. It's Rafe Marino. You know, I think there must be some mistake. I never applied for membership in your club. A gift? From whom? And when did Mr. Heaton buy it? OK. Thanks. A surprise for my birthday. He bought it a week before he died. That's when he was trying to contact me. Oh... This is Laura Clifford. Please leave me a message at the sound of the beep. Hey, it's me. I was hoping to stop by. But you just don't seem to be in. Anyway... I just find myself missing you. See you later. Italians from our neighbourhood don't play tennis. Except of course the ones whose rich preppy friends buy them memberships. You're a snob, you know that? There's nothing wrong with learning to live well. I like the way I live. Always have. Snob. You know, there's a reason he did this. I'm just not sure what it is. Can't you accept a gift graciously? Not lately. Anyway, come on, let's get out there. You said you needed exercise. I meant basketball. A little one on one. You crazy? You can beat me at that. I know. I like this place. Of course. Next time we play my game. I don't think so. What, you don't like losing? I'll buy you a drink. Excuse me. Could I get a couple of cranberries and sodas? Sorry, I'm not the bartender here. Oh, sorry! You're new here? - Yeah. - Dino. Assistant pro. I'm Rafe Marino. - This is Gloria Moretti. - Hi. Hi. I like new members who bring beautiful tennis partners. And I like assistant pros who flatter me. And I'd like to meet the tennis pro. Is he around? Oh. That would have been Rod McGee. They're still looking for his replacement. - What, he left? - He died. From what? He had some problem with his heart. Had he been sick? No. It just came out of nowhere. How long ago? Two, maybe 3 months ago. Anyway, it was nice meet you guys. Yeah. - I'll send that bartender over. - Thanks. From what I can find out, none of these guys were sick. They were all young and healthy. And there's a good chance they were seeing the same woman. What about this tennis pro. McGee? Did he get the same faxes too? I'm checking. Well, nobody else is. Maybe nobody else sees what you see. Come on, Captain. You have to admit this is odd. Not necessarily. You're telling me it's coincidence? I'm not buying that. Listen, somebody dies in this city every 13 minutes. They drown, they get shot, they even have heart attacks. Believe me, there's no multinational conspiracy. OK, maybe not. But I think he's on to something. Everybody's on to something. When he gets something, then I'm interested. Thanks for your help. You know better than this, Moretti. I know Rafe's not gonna left this one go. Even if he has to follow it up himself. Hey look, I'm sorry. He can be a real jerk sometimes. Screw him. He'd have to listen if I had something besides theory. Damn it! Why didn't Tommy tell me anything about her? You know, we didn't have those kinds of secrets. He wouldn't have told you, Rafe. He was slumming. It had to be something more than that. You ever think that what drew you to Tommy might have been what drew Tommy to you? Tommy wasn't slumming with me, Gloria! No! That's not what I meant. I think he was intrigued with the "street" in you. You know, you're a good detective, but a lousy analyst. Hey, come here. I'm on your side. You know that? - Hello? - Hey. How did it go? Webster won't touch it. - Are you OK? - Not really. Well, um... Is there anything I can do? I'll be all right. I tell you what. Why don't you let me take care of you tonight? Pamper you a little. You know, make you a great dinner, we can curl up beside the fire and you can tell me all about it. You know, get it off your chest. Will you wear the same coat you had on last night? I never cook a meal without it. Then you got a date. OK. Bye. Dammit! - Mr. Marino? - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Ruth Cassidy. Wilston Realtors. Thank you so much for phoning me. I really appreciate it. You've a lovely, lovely home. Thank you. Hey, Donna. Any calls? Well, I'm here at Tommy's with the realtor. So I should be back around, say, 4:00 p.m. OK, thanks. Hey, Tommy, it's your sister, Jane. Remember me? Come on, give me a call. Bye. : Hi, Tommy! I'm gonna be a little late tonight. I'll meet you at your house say 'round 10:00? What about those designers you talked to? Any of them has a southern accent like her? No. But they have something to do with this. I'm sure of it. OK, leave it here. I want to see if they can enhance it. You still fiddling with those things? Good looking shirt you got there. Yeah. It feels great. I bet it does. It's Tommy's, right? You look better in a torn T. You saying you think I look cute? Not anymore! Sure you are. Admit it. Oh, please. OK. I gotta get back to work. Oh! That is some clever dinner menu! Well, you said it was your favourite meal. And tonight is all about pampering you. Oh... It's like having breakfast in bed. That is the general idea. Don't answer it. They'll go away. No, they're not. But I'll get rid of them. Hey, uh.... I need to talk to you about something. This isn't a good time. Oh. - Um... - Sorry... - Gloria Moretti. - Yeah, this is Gloria Moretti. - This is Laura Clifford. - Hello. Hi. I didn't want to bother you I just had to drop this off, so... Breakfast! Yeah. I love French toast, so... I know. Would you like to join us? Oh, no! No. You should stay. Laura makes great French toast. I bet she does. And hash browns! Yeah. Come on, you know you can't resist. I'll get an extra plate. Thank you. Nice. Yeah. Hash browns? Yeah. Not bad. I should get your recipe. I didn't mean to stay so long. I've monopolized your whole dinner. Well, we've enjoyed your company. Right, Rafe? Yeah. Uh, did we find out anything about the tape? They're still working on it. Oh. She's starting to become real to me. Not too real, I hope. Um, do we know any more about the tennis pro? We can talk about that later. No. It's OK. Oh. Well, Rafe is right. It's all very strange. Gloria? The tennis pro? Yeah. Yeah, he got the faxes too. Hey! The guys are really excited about Saturday's softball game! 4:00 p.m., right? You'll be back before the ballet, right? The charity benefit, remember? Of course! Yeah, of course. I'll be able to do both. - OK. - OK. All right. So, are you tired of me yet? Hardly! Let's just say you seemed so distant tonight. Oh, it's not you. It's just... You know, this thing with Tommy is really starting to bug me. I know. And I want you to know I understand that. Just as long as that's all it is. What else could it be? You know? We're good. You're perfect. Well, I don't think your friend Gloria thinks so. Why would you say that? I think she likes you. More than just a friend. That was a long time ago. We both took different paths. What do you mean different? She wanted to stay in the neighbourhood and I wanted to see what else was out there. I think she regrets it. No chance. And you? Look what I found. Nice! That was a good shot. So uh, tell me about Rod McGee. What do you want to know? Well, about his social life. His women. Like everybody else, I guess. Only more so. God, that man had moves. Who had moves? - Rod. - He had a great butt too. Can't stay away from me, can you? So, is this a lucky accident or do you belong here? - I'm new. - How fortunate. So, you knew Rod McGee well? He was the pro here. Well, even I knew that. Well, I never kiss and tell. Make an exception. There's my match. Gotta go. What, he was seeing Ellen? He was seeing everybody. What's with all the questions? Ah, just curious. Any main woman? Some chick sent him flowers every time he won a match. Weird to send a guy flowers, don't you think? You ever see any card? No. Always the same kind of flowers though. Glass bowl, white flowers. A real sweet smell. Hmm... You know, there's nothing more magnificent then the sight of a graceful ballerina on point. You bet. I especially liked the part where the black swan, the wicked Odile, seduces the handsome prince. Your stop, Miss Clifford. Stop? Um, just for a minute. I have to stop at the office and pick up the keys for the morning. Oh. Just what was I supposed to say? I don't know. How about the truth? You worked here the whole time and you never told me. And I saw you at both funerals. I knew those men. Socially. They were prominent people in this town. Why wouldn't I be at their funeral? Why didn't you tell me you worked here? Let me ask you a question. You've called me 3 times a day since we've met. Where'd you think you were calling? Your office. You never said where it was. You never asked! Rafe, when did you say that the faxes came from Glimmer Interior Design? What are you talking about? When did you say that? I don't know. We've talked about it so many times. Yes. But when did you say the words "Glimmer Interior Design"? I don't know, Laura. Exactly. You don't know because you never said it. You said they came from the same place. You never said where that place was. Of course I did! I must of! You can never be wrong, can you? Oh, especially now. You think you've got it all figured out. I knew those men, my office is here. I must have killed them. Right? Come on. I'm not really saying that. But you said you worked in real estate. What are you doing working here? Let's get something straight. OK? I don't work here. I own the building. In fact, I own many buildings. This place is convenient, so I keep my office here. Are we at Glimmer Interior Design? No. They're my tenants, Rafe. OK? They pay the rent. They keep up the property. I don't know what they do with their fax machines. It's all very logical. You know what I think, Rafe? I think you would use any excuse to blow this out of proportion because this, you and me, scares you to death. Oh, please! This is what you do when things get too good? Right, Laura. Put the focus on me. Maybe that's where it belongs. I don't need this. I think you should leave. Yeah. I think you're right. Yeah, you do it. I've seen you do it. When? Name one time. I could name 10. Well, start with one. All right. That court reporter in your firm. You invented some crazy reason to end that. We weren't right for each other. That's what you always say. Oh, What about Nancy? I didn't end that. That was college. You didn't have your act down. - I wanted to marry her. - 'Cause you knew she wouldn't! You're wrong. We had it planned. Until she realized you weren't the Marino from Wall Street, you were the Marino from the grocery store on Broadway. Rafe, you've always had a blind spot for these society types. You just never admit it to yourself. I'm very clear about Laura. And you've had a problem with it from the beginning. My problem is with you. I heard the girl on the tape. It's not her voice. I'm telling you, it's not her style. Why would someone like Laura pick up a guy with faxes? She was at both funerals. Oh, please. She hardly knew them. What do you expect her to say? That's not fair. Oh, but it was fair when you said it. I know. I'm reconsidering. I think my perspective is a little less clouded. And this has got nothing to do with the fact that I'm involved with her? Egotistical jerk. I haven't felt that way about you since the tenth grade. You sure? OK, maybe it galls me that you fall so hard for them. Maybe it's because my sweet 16 was at Luigi's. But she did know those guys, and she could have used that fax machine. Then again, maybe I'm not so objective. Are you spying on me? ...and when I saw you come down this deserted road, I got concerned. Uh-huh. It isn't safe for you to be wandering around here by yourself. I own this place, Rafe. This is where I come as a retreat, OK? It's perfectly safe. This is yours? I'm just surprised, that's all! It's just so different from your house in town. It suits me. This is where I come when I want to be alone. When I want to be... You know, just... What do you want, Rafe? Uh... Look, Laura. I don't know what that was the other night. OK, you had a point. I was out of line. Well, you had doubts about me. You must still have questions. So, go ahead, ask. You answered everything the other night. You actually thought I killed him? I thought it was possible. Then say it. I don't think that anymore. Why not? Because I know you. Is that better? Much. Daddy said he was leaving. That he'd fallen in love with someone else. A woman who had another little girl. He was going to live with them. I hated that little girl. Anyway, um... They had a fight that morning. And I remember my mother was throwing all of his clothes in a garbage bag and screaming at him. "Take everything and don't ever come back". That's when it happened. What happened? He was standing at the top of the staircase, and he fell. It was an accident. I tried to catch him, I swear I did. He died right there, on the marble floor. He was alive one minute and then gone the next. How old were you? Eight. He said that no one would ever love me like he did. That I was his special little girl. But he lied. Poor thing. A part of me was glad he never got to go. Ah, this is a different look for you. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. It doesn't mean anything. I'm just not used to seeing you dress this way. Well you know, this is the way I feel so this is the way I dressed. Every time I think I know you, you surprise me. You know, we're all a little more complicated than we seem, Rafe. So it appears. Not to put too fine a point on it, but weren't you wearing something different when you left the office? The pretty skirt. I don't think I like this third degree. Come on, it's just conversation. Maybe. Maybe not. I'll call you later. Don't forget tomorrow. The awards ceremony at the club. I want to see who shows up. I won't be able to make it. Why not? I don't have anything to wear. OK, everyone. Just a little speech. I want to thank Laurelmount for this great-looking trophy. And I also want to thank Susan, the number one seed, for spraining her ankle and not showing up. To paraphrase Blanche DuBois, the best role of my short yet illustrious acting career : I have always relied on the kindness of better tennis players. - Dino. - Rafe. - Is this seat taken? - It's all yours. Great, thanks. Ellen, congratulations. You look nice. Dino, scoot. OK, Rafe, we're on. Doubles. We take on all comers. Ah. How about tomorrow? I don't want to lose my edge. You still competing, Ellen? Don't be a sore loser. I had the sun in my eyes. : Besides, you had the kindness of better tennis players. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Time for a toast. Here's to winning. Mmm... It's great! You should you try some. Oh! Ooh! Sorry! So sorry! Let me get that. Yeah. There you go. "Meet me at the beach." Thursday. Mmm... I woke up and I was kicking myself for not going with you. Good. Mmm... It was 3:00 in the morning. I was angry but I realized it was too silly. So I remembered where the key was and here I am. Well, it's a nice way to wake up. Mmm-hmm. Oh, freesias. My favourite! Now I'm getting flowers. Bingo. I hit a nerve. I can't just drop everything and go to lunch. I don't have a fancy job in a law office. I'm working. I'm a working stiff. You're a cop. And better than that, you're a detective. I need your help. She's closing in on me now. What do you mean? She sent me flowers, and I got a fax. Just like the other guys. Did you follow it up? Of course. The florist said the order was paid for in cash. First time customer. She was busy yesterday, so she didn't really pay attention to who it was. Look, I know Webster won't let you get involved officially. So you want another favour. Unofficially. Just follow up on those two. That Hilary and Ellen. I know the answer's somewhere close to them. OK. You know, I'm only doing this because I like having you in my debt. I always knew that about you! Get out of here! Hello? What? No, not now. I can't stop now. I'm late for a meeting downtown. Tommy's maid was found this morning dead in her bathtub. Just like the others. Not like the others. The others were young guys who got faxes. Well, there has to be some connection. Why was she still working at the house anyway? He's dead. She was keeping it up until it sold. The rich. Even from the grave they have servants. Look, I need you to send the stuff from her bathtub over to the lab to see if it tells us anything. Get it to me. There's a guy there who owes me a favour. Just make sure Webster doesn't see you drop it off, OK? He's already starting to ask questions. I love you, Glor! Now he admits it! Did I scare you? What are you doing down here? Well, I hear this is where lawyers hang out for lunch. And I hear you're a lawyer. Huh. Yeah. Did you ever find that woman you were looking for? - No. Not yet. - Oh. So is there any chance you'll be looking for a woman who doesn't send faxes? Uh, I'd like to but, I'm kind of seeing someone right now. Define "kind of". Um, I'm sorry Ellen, it's not gonna work. Can't say I don't try. There's no time on this. What time did this come in at? Uh... Around 3:00 in the morning. Thanks. I'm going to take a good look at this office building. Why do you think you'll find something new? Because I'm going when no one else is around. I'm coming with you. No. I can't let you do that. You're a cop. And I don't expect to do this by the book. - I'm coming. - No. Good morning. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. You must have got up early. Yeah, I couldn't sleep. Well, that's too bad. I slept like a baby. Well, I got bad guys to catch so I'd better get to it. I'll call you later. All right. Thanks for coming over. Yeah. Bye, Gloria. Rafe... Hot little number, that Ellen. What do you know about her? She comes from very old money. Her father died. She hates working here but it pleases Mama. And Mama controls the purse strings. Of course. Of course. Hilary is pretty much of an enigma. Standard deb bio. Very cool exterior. There's definitely something more to her. She kicked up a real fuss in college. What did she do? Her and some friends rigged a rival homecoming float with a load of fireworks. Blew it to shreds before it reached the judges. Nice girls do things like that? Her family had to cough up a large endowment to get her... graduated. What's that? Spain. You're sure, operator? Nine digits for the whole of Spain? There's not one area with 7 digits? OK. Thank you. - Hi. - You were coming over. I was, it's just it's late and I'm exhausted. Is there anyway we can skip tonight? You're gonna be sorry. I think I already am. Bye-bye. Gloria, there's a new fax number this time. Can you get me the address? Now! Right this minute! 555-0123. OK, thanks. Gotcha! Dammit! What are you doing here, Ellen? Well, I was hoping I might catch you on your way back from a hot date that turned cold. Were you so sure I'd be alone? Would that make a difference? Where were you tonight, Ellen? Out and about. Out at a drug store busily sending faxes? What are you talking about? You know, I'm getting these sneaky little faxes and I'm not too crazy about it. I don't send faxes, Rafe. If I have something to say, I say it directly. And just what is it you're saying when you stop by unannounced at midnight? That I have urges. Don't you ever get urges, Rafe? Maybe for something sweet? Someone sexy? Someone you'd like to kiss. Or more. Mr. Marino, this is Ruth Cassidy's assistant. She has a buyer for Mr. Heaton's house. Please meet her there at 8:00. : Rafe? Where are you? I'm back here in the den. Don't you think it's time we met? You seem to know so much about me... and me so little about you. Rafe... I'm coming for you! The broker said she never left you any message. At least that can make Webster put me on the case officially. - Oh, what a guy. - I did some other checking. Just preliminary stuff, and... Well... And what? I'll do a more thorough check tomorrow. The trail went cold before she showed up in New York. Are you going to tell me you ran a check on Laura? I had to, Rafe. I knew you wouldn't. She has no family left in Dallas. Her grandparents are both dead. I could have told you that. You just had to ask me. I guess you know about her sister? Her sister? I didn't get that. Yeah, she moves around a lot. Nobody knows exactly where she is. You know, her mother lives somewhere in Europe and that's it, there's no other family. What a waste of time! You could have just asked me! OK, smart guy. What about her schools? Did she go to boarding school? Don't they all go to boarding school? OK, a little less attitude, Gloria. All right? She grew up in Dallas after her father died. She was around 8, I guess, and lived with her grandparents. The whole silver spoon bit, and that's it. That's where you're wrong. There was no silver spoon. She grew up in a two-horse town in Texas. Madrid, I think it was. Where? Madrid, Texas. God, Texas! What is it? It's the number I found on Tommy's desk. Annandale Psychiatric Hospital. I gotta check something out, Gloria. Who's there? Hey, it's just me! I knocked but you didn't hear. Thank God. You scared me. I'll be right out. OK? Yeah, OK. I'll be here. - Hey, can you get that? - Yeah, sure. No problem. Hello? Oh. I must have the wrong number. No, no. Are you looking for Laura Clifford? Yes. Yeah, she's up in the shower. Can I take a message? I'm her mother. Who are you? It's Rafe Marino. I'm a friend of Laura's. Oh, yes. She told me all about you. Yeah, and you too. How's Europe? Fine, I assume. I'm in the States right now. Oh, visiting your other daughter? Excuse me? Laura's sister. Is Laura all right? Yeah. Of course. Then have her call me, will you please? Yeah. OK... Hello? This is the kind of surprise I like. Hi. Hey. I've got a better idea instead of dinner. Come here. No, Laura. What? Hold on. Hello? OK. I'll see you then. You're going? It's important. More important than me? Huh? You know, I... I can't. And by the way... your mother called. Hello! Hello. I have something for you. What's this? Transmission reports. Our office fax machine automatically puts one out every month. I completely forgot about them. Well, you made such a nuisance of yourself over those faxes, instead of tossing them in the file like I usually do, I took a closer look. Look at this. There is your home number and that's pre-set. The 22nd, 3:00 a.m. and the 24th, 5:00 a.m. Yeah, I remember them well. I didn't think they could have come from our fax but I guess you were right all along. Thank you. Which is why I pulled the last few months from the file. What's that number you gave me? Tommy Heaton's, right? Yeah. Two months ago. The 10th, the 12th and the 15th. Ellen was in Europe that week. She couldn't have sent them. Van Allen's number's there. That was the week I was in the hospital hav... Uh, never mind. Rod McGee's name? Ellen was back East antiquing. You're sure it's just one person who's sending these faxes, right? Yeah. It's not Ellen, and it is not me. Those weren't pre-set. So unless we're working as a team, neither of us was around to send them all. Unless our 80-year-old cleaning lady has an overactive libido, somebody else has a key to our office. No, I'm an attorney. You know, maybe I should speak to the person in charge. Look, you're the third person I've been transferred to. All I want is a yes or no. Gloria, Gloria! Look, if I need something specific, I'll get you the necessary documents to release the paperwork. I just want to save us both time and trouble. Any luck with the prints? Clean so far. Webster's finally agreed to start the process to exhume all 3 bodies. We'll see if they were heart attacks after all. OK, thanks. OK. Thank you. Ellen Antonelli. Was she a patient at Annandale around 20 years ago? Hilary Anderson? Neither one? OK. Um, how about Laura Clifford? Good, that's good. No, not Laura Crawford, Clifford. Thank you. All right. Uh, excuse me. Sorry. Is Laura around? Uh, not at the moment. Who are you? I'm Rafe Marino. I'm a friend of Laura's. Hello, Rafe. We talked together on the phone. I'm Laura's mother. Oh! Nice to meet you! Please come and sit. Thank you. Uh, your perfume reminds me of Laura. My late husband adored the smell of freesias. It was his favourite. He had this made for me when we were first married. It's beautiful. Please. Thank you. So, when's Laura due back? Oh, she had a few last minute errands. We're going away for the weekend. Oh. She didn't tell me. We just decided. I see. And how long are you in town for, Mrs. Clifford? - Crawford. - I'm sorry? Mrs. Crawford. Oh, Laura took her grandfather's name. Laura Crawford. Right, Crawford. Annandale Psychiatric in Texas. God, I hope I'm wrong about this. I don't want this to be true. Hi! Hey. You inviting me in? I'm sorry. It's just everything happened so fast. Mother came in and I didn't have a chance to call you. Then she insists on going off and spending quality time together at a spa. I don't even know where she arranged it all! Oh, come on. Don't be mad at me. Stop it, Laura. Stop what? The stories. The lies. Madrid, Texas? That ring a bell? Of course. I was born there. How about Annandale Psychiatric Hospital? Oh. Yeah. "Oh". I had a breakdown. For God's sake! Go on. My father died. I couldn't cope with the loss so I got professional help. You're gonna vilify me for that? Laura, please. You know, this is a painful part of my life, Rafe. I don't like to talk about it. I try not to think about it. So frankly, this is none of your business. Maybe. But I need to hear it, Laura. OK. I was 8 years old. And scared. I'd just lost the most important person in my life. And in a horrible way. How exactly did you lose him? I told you this, Rafe. At the top of the stairs. He fell. And it was an accident? Yes, of course. They tried to blame me but... it was an accident! I don't what what to believe anymore. I need to sort this out. Then you sort this out. But leave me out of it. Hey. I had a feeling you'd still be here. Yeah, I got to be in court tomorrow at 9:00. How you holding up? Fine. OK, you know, I'm not fine. Actually the truth is I'm... I'm feelling pretty lousy. I know. No thanks. I know. That's why I came by. To uh, make you feel better. Oh... Chocolate covered doughnuts. Hmm. That's the way you used to seduce me back in the day. Who knows, maybe I'm still trying. You know, I... I don't want any of this to be true. I don't want to be wrong about her. Maybe you are. Maybe none of this will pan out. Yeah, but my gut tells me that... I know you really care about her. You know, maybe I'm just looking for the wrong things. No. You're not. You're looking for the right things, just in the wrong people. Look, go home for a while. Take your doughnuts and go get some rest. I just need to stop thinking about this. I am gonna go home, shut off my phone, take a shower and try to become human again. Good idea. Did you sort everything out? You know Rafe, everyone comes with a past. I thought I could keep mine to myself. But I was wrong. Look Laura, you know I wish things were different but you know, things just aren't that... Shh, OK? Come and sit down with me please? We'll talk after you've relaxed a little bit. OK? What's that? This? My mother gave it to me. Huh. Doesn't that feel good? Mmm-hmm. I know exactly what you need. My sister taught me how to do this. She's right. It makes the skin feel so soft. You have to massage it deeply into the skin. Gloria! Yeah? Lab report. What the hell? I never heard of such a thing. Me neither. So I talked to the guy at the lab. Now they all died in the bathtub. But it could have been in a sauna he says, or even a shower. What happens, the steam opens the pores of the skin, the toxin is absorbed, causing what appears to be... A heart attack! Yeah. What's the matter? Gloria? I want you to meet my sister. What's her name? Louise. I'm going to get more oil. This is Rafe. Leave a message and... Dammit! You better not touch him. You better not touch him. I'm coming, Rafe. I'm coming! Now, that feels good, doesn't it? : You're never gonna leave me for another woman. Or somebody else's little girl like daddy did. I knew once he was at the top of those stairs, he's gonna go out that door and never come back. I can't let that happen. I can't hear you, Laura. Of course you can't. Laura's gone. I'm Louise. Rafe, pick up the phone! Ah... Ah... Ah... Rafe! Rafe! Oh... Rafe! Get out of there right away! - Are you OK, Rafe? - What... What are you doing? - What are you doing? - It's OK. Don't leave me! You'll be fine. Get this stuff off of you. Don't leave me, Rafe. You're gonna be fine. Laura? Laura? Drop the knife. Drop the knife! Drop the knife! So, where are we going? I thought we'd walk over to Carmine's for lunch. A little pasta, bottle of vino? Maybe some of his ricotta pie for dessert. How's that sound? Sounds great. Just like old times. Life's funny, you know? I wasted so much time looking for that person who'd complete me. And all the time, there you were. I always knew you were far-sighted. Come on, Romeo.
