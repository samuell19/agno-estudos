(NATIVE HAWAIIAN CHANTING) (CHANTER LAUGHING) (MUSIC) (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) (MAN SINGING HAWAIIAN FOLK SONG) BRIAN: There was a time I knew everything in the sky. Every satellite... every constellation... "souvenirs of space walks and astronauts.“..." wand rockets hunched by NASA in the '60s. As a kid, I looked up and felt the future. It belonged to me. ♪ ♪ I know you've deceived me Now here's a surprise ♪ Hey, hey, man, check this out. BRIAN: Then 2008 happened. Budgets crashed. NASA was just another business looking for cash. The billionaires took over. Satellite pirates with deep pockets, drunk with the idea of ruling the world. I left the military and took a job with the biggest billionaire of them all. Carson Welsh. I went lo the gray side. Messed up bad in Kabul, Afghanistan, broke about 18 bones in two legs. Lost my gig. For a year, I waited for scraps... like a hungry cat outside a seafood restaurant dumpster. Finally, I got a crappy second chance. - At least I was going back to Hawaii. - Woody. Just wanted to say hello before we landed. (INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO) How you doing? (GRUNTS) How's the contractor job going? Miss the uniform? Sometimes. Heard you popped your balloons in Afghanistan. Thought you were dead. I'm excited about this gig. I'm delivering a blessing on a pedestrian gate. Only in Hawaii, huh? - Below the aloha exterior. - Casablanca, baby. (BRIAN LAUGHS) Tracy's gonna flip out when she sees you. (HAWAIIN FOLK SONG PLAYING) - BOY: Colonel Lacy? - LACY: Yes, sir. Are you aware of the so-called Arrival myth? - What's that? - The calendars say... that this week is the return of the playful Hawaiian god Lono... and he will wreak havoc in the sky with the fire goddess Pele. - WOMAN: Mitchell? Hey. - Oh. Sorry. Sorry. He's a Hawaiian-myth buff. LACY: Yeah, of course he is. All right, Mitchell, be cool. Relax and enjoy a bitching summer.

Looks like we're down to dwindling resources, huh? Colonel, I'm here to save you, you great white obsolete whale. After Kabul, I'm surprised you can make a joke. - Can I be honest? You look terrible. - I've missed your psychotic hands. Good times. When's the last time we worked together? - Silent Reaper? - Jesus. Silent Reaper? Yeah. It's been a while. - How's your life? - I got no life. You're my life, Fingers. "Colonel." Nobody calls me Fingers anymore. I'm a big old deal around here. Got my name on the wall.

He comes to me and goes, "Uncle, you like warm water?" - BOTH: Ha-ha-ha. - BUMPY: And I go, "Right on, brother." And that was it. That changed my whole turn on military. So a military? Bigtime respect for them when they're doing the right things. It's an honor to be here. It's just a budget thing, Bumpy. We're combining two bases and moving the pedestrian gate... and you can move the bones wherever, not one tibia will be out of place. We just need a 20-minute blessing.

I can't... I can't give you back Hawaii, Bumpy. And free cell phone service.
