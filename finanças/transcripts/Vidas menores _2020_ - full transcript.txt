When you have not crossed yet and have not seen this country you only think that you will get to cross, that you will find a job and earn money… Stuff like that. But once you arrive, you meet people that came much sooner, at 16 or 18, who are still homeless without a job or legal status. But, in spite of that, you only think you will realize that dream. Brother Ismail, I'm Rbati. - Rbati, how are you brother? - I'm fine. How are you? What a joy to hear you! - Where are you now? Where? - I'm still in Bilbao. -Okay brother. Better than here in Ceuta. But I'm still roaming the streets, brother Ismail. Have you heard about what happened here? Yes, who is the boy who died? A boy whose name was Ilias, he sneaked under a truck and got killed. - He was from Martil, right? - Yes, he was from Martil. Those days I also was in the port, I saw there were no possibilities and went to the Center for minors. Wish me luck so that I receive paperwork in the Center. I have three months left there… I have no doubt, brother. God help you Ismail, I tell you from the heart. God willing, we will meet again. As I told you, mountains never meet, friends do. -Do you have a passport? Do you have legal papers? He is Algerian. The three of you? No, just him. - You are a minor, right? - Yes, I am a minor. -And why do you sleep here? Why don't you sleep in the Center? - I don't want the Center. - Is it better on the street? The Center has bad workers. -Bad workers? But it's worse on the street, isn't it? In the street I can go to the Peninsula to look for a living, unlike here. The police came and accused us of mugging these boys. Their passports and money were stolen from them and they wanted to blame us. Now I'm going… I'm going to sleep. Every day I sleep in a different place. Sometimes on a cardboard in any corner of the street, sometimes next to a bin. Today I'm going to sleep in the car park of the port. There are cars and vans broken and abandoned. There is a big van there, we call it 'the hotel'… 'The port hotel;' Us boys sleep inside. I will see who is inside now. If there are no boys, I will sleep there. If there are many, I will look for another place. I will sleep one or two hours and then I will do risky again. This is the 'Seven star hotel' of the port. There are two boys sleeping. This van is good for starting a sandwich bar at the beach. If it was in Morocco, it would have been taken to sell sandwiches. How long have you been here? A month and a half now. - And you, how long? - A month. And me, I've been here for 4 years, what can I say... You are dangerous. Do you have money to fix it and we'll leave? If I had 5,000 dirhams, I would buy a spot in a boat. - In a boat from Morocco? - How much does it cost from Ceuta? 2,000 euros, I think. No, I think it's more expensive. - It's 20,000 dirhams. - Ah, okay! That is death, for sure. It's safe, in 10 minutes you are in Algeciras. If you take it in Morocco, you depend on luck. How much does it cost from Morocco? From my neighborhood it's 6,500 euros. Yes, that's the price. Some make it to Madrid and others are deported. Let's see if God helps us achieve it. Do we continue or what? Let's see if at least we see our parents again. Should we go? Let's go. I'm sick of the problems of the port. The police, the people… You're stopped and blamed for thefts, you're hit, you try to cross and you can't. In Ceuta we have only problems, we come here just to do risky. There are only problems in Ceuta. But well, what can we do. Thank God for living. It's better to live like that than to live in our country. We also have to think about our parents. It's better this way, so our parents don't see what we do. We don't want to make them cry when we are put behind bars. This way we don't make them suffer. Leaving was for the best. It is better to live far from family. If you stay in your country, you will end up in prison and your parents are poor, they won't be able to bail you out. We have no studies, no job… That's why we came here, to try to make a living. But you realise that nobody understands or feels like you even if you are a minor. I burned myself. Why did I do it? To protest against injustice and abuse. You see there's nothing, the police hit you, there's no future. Death is better. We wanted a better life and look how we are. This is not life, brother. But when we reach the Peninsula, our dreams will come true, God willing. I would like to cross to Europe and keep studying or specialize in some job and then come back with my mother, inshallah, and make her life happy and build her a house, even gift her a trip to Mecca. We have come to this city to cross to the other side. You have to understand us. We have come to this city to go there and build a future. If we wanted the wrong path, we would have stayed there. We want paperwork. We want rights. Do you know why you can see all these boys by the port? Because we have no place, no love, nothing. We are minors and poor. We are brave poverty, just so you know. We are little men, poor but strong ones. You know, there's a possibility that I could go spend the holidays in Morocco. These days I got some money but I don't know what I'm going to do. My mother tells me to go there but I don't want to. I will go to spend the holidays God willing, and then I will come back and do risky with renewed strength. Bilbao is very good! Spain serves us as an anchor to get paperwork. I have to stop in Spain to get documentation though, actually, I want to go to Canada. God willing, to Norway… to the world. There's where I'll go, God willing: Canada, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, France… For me, Spain is a crossing point, like a motorway. All countries: Spain, Italy France… From the biggest to the smallest, you know? All countries are better than Morocco. Morocco is not good. There's a lot of poor in Morocco, many people who steal, a lot of violence. The King… danger. When you hear some boy has died, run over you think that he can be your son, same as it happened to another boy, it can happen to yours. Nobody walks in your shoes. Nobody knocked on my door to ask me if I needed anything, if I was sick, if I needed help. Nobody is worried about my daughters when I go to work and they stay alone. My only concern is Ismail. I just wish he is fine before I die. I just want that Europeans from Spain, France, any country… How do their children live? That they feel sorry for ours as well. That they see in them something good. When they see a child sleeping on cardboards in the port, all they see is a boy who sniffs glue. But he is also a victim and his parents are very sorry for him. We were on the beach and thereby for a long time, we were hungry so we came here to get something to eat. But we haven't got anything yet though we have been here for two hours. Let's see if we are lucky and somebody gives us something to eat. Bad luck. I heard the boys scream. The boys who were drugged were fighting each other. Drugs toy with them. I don't know why they fighted but surely because of nonsense. In the street one cannot dream. The street can hurt you, the street harms you… The street can do many things in you. The street is hard. Many things may happen in the street, abuse, theft, illnesses, many things… Many more things. He's filming how we take drugs. He's filming us drugged. Don't film us like that. Do film something that benefits us, like when we laugh or fight each other. Hey! Tell him not to film me taking drugs. Take drugs or do whatever the fuck you want. It's your life! Listen to me! Alfredo! Someone is going to bring us couscous. Caballa couscous! Just make balls and... to the mouth! There is someone who is going to bring us food. They are bringing us food; they are a good person. I was passing by and I gave them something for charity, they were starving. I gave them breakfast and they asked me if I could bring them couscous on Friday. Since they are Moroccan, they missed couscous. What they wanted is for me to bring them couscous on Friday. So that's is. I have complied with… And that's why I have brought them couscous. If they had a roof over their heads, a family, food… I wouldn't send my son to the street. They wouldn't choose to be in this situation, because they have no love, no food. Who would like to be homeless? I don't know what is the reason that pushes them to be here, there must be a strong reason for them to be on the street. If they had a good home, a good family, even humble, but with a plate of food, I think they wouldn't be here, but I don't know. I come from a normal family but they don't make ends meet to support us all. When I'm older I'll have no future in that environment. I have to study and I have to… We had food and drink at home, we were not hungry but my family doesn't have much money. If I want something, I have to work to get it. My parents can't give me many things because of money. Their work gives just enough to live, to bring food. If I saw opportunities in Morocco, I would stay there, but I don't see them, that's why I prefer to go to Spain, build a future, enter the Center for minors and study for a profession, any profession. The important thing is not to stay in Morocco, and when I'm older then return with paperwork, with my Spanish residence permit. God help us. We ask God to get there safe and sound. There're people who are doing well economically, with houses, rents, cars, business… Why do they send their children to have a hard time? There are people with money who risk sending their children to the sea, paying for their transportation without thinking that they can lose them. Why? They have a good life here. They leave no room for those in real need those who may not even have parents. Those are the ones who must be helped, because people don't know that there are rich and poor together. I know one to whom his grandfather bought a house, and even having the house, he went to the Center for minors of Ceuta, to continue the trip later and go to Germany. I know wealthy people who have sent their children to Europe. We cannot say that the Spanish don't take care of our children nor they don't devote time to them. We know there are too many boys there and you find boys who have and boys who don't sleeping together on the street. God bless you all! They are Moroccans. Family family family… Give us something to eat. That boy was here, his family came and took him. Well, it will be to feed him, then they will leave him at the port again. Family? What kind of family is that? You come from abroad, stop by Ceuta to say hello, and... do you leave him in the street again? That is not how you do things. If they were a real family, they would have to come and… They would have to come and take him with them or something like that, okay? Nothing! What family?! If you are the family, he is your son! Turn off that fucking camera. I've been in the Center for minors for a month and on the street for a month and two days. I've just gone to my home for the religious holidays. It's my mother who put me in Ceuta, with the passport. My mother comes to visit me in Ceuta every three days or so. She buys me clothes and gives me money, 5 or 10 euros, and brings me clothes… I hope to achieve my dream of crossing, either like this or paying. I want to arrive in Spain. My favourite cities are Bilbao or Barcelona. In Catalonia, you can get paperwork very fast, and there are Moroccans who help others with their problems. There are mosques where, if you are seen going to pray, they help you look for a job, with a place to sleep… They help you with anything. I ran away from Morocco for a reason. Soon, half of Moroccan boys will enter Ceuta and Melilla because if they don't study or work, they will be forced to join the Army. They will be sent to the Sahara Desert. No boy wants that, to be sent to the Polisario. To the war… The people are fighting. Some tubes threw on him and he died! Who is dead? - Tigaga. - Was he doing risky with you? He was not with me, I saw him from afar. Poor boy, he left his family to come here to die, what future is this! -You should see it for yourself! See if they are dead or not! -We have not been allowed! We have not been allowed! Run, run and see what happened! -We have not been allowed! Do you want to be hit? What's the matter now! Do you wanna have our bones broken? -Fuck that! I'm 21 and, since I was born, I'm used to being hit like this! I do not care about anyone! I do not know the cameraman, fuck! Don't film me! Get out! Hey boys! Are you men or pussies?! Let's go in and see what happened! They are our brothers! The police hit the boys so that they can't see what's happening. They killed our brothers, they said the boys sneaked under a truck and hosed them pressurized water so the boys died. Now we are going in to check it and no matter if we are hit. Life or death! Come on, let's go! -Who wants to enter? Who is going to enter? We're going to be filmed entering, Ismail. Where are you entering from, Ismail? If you don't come, don't ask! Fuck it! Come on, let’s get in! I bring my passport and I'm going in! I have my passport in my pocket and I'm fucking going in! Come on minors! Whomever stays here isn't a man! - God determines what will happen. - Alae may be taken to jail! And what the fuck is this one doing filming here? Calm down, so be it if God wills. - There they are! Come on! - Let's block their way! Motherfuckers! - He is not dead! Go away! - Brother! He is not dead! He's fine! They are our friends! Go away! You go away! We have worried a lot about you. Look, one of them. He is still a litle dizzy. You almost died! He is still dizzy, he was about to die. The other one is a little chubby, that's why he got stuck, without air. Alae is a little better. Was he also taken in the ambulance? Yes, yes. And Tagile? He was taken in a van. No no, he got into a truck. Another one is coming, look! Now there are two of them. We got into a very narrow hole well hidden and when I wanted to get off, I couldn't. Then they brought levers and started to open until they took us out. My friend passed out. I say! Tell us what happened. Shut up! - There were three of us. - And the fourth? No, only three: me, Rinconi… The other was taken to the hospital. Everyone who wants to go to the Peninsula approaches their mother and sheds a couple of tears: 'Mom, I want to cross' or 'dad, I want to cross.' Wealthy parents answer: 'Okay son, as long as you don't sleep on the street.' They come here and look for the way to help him cross on a zodiac, in patera, or on a plastic boat, so he arrives immediately. However, in the case of the poor boys, when they ask their parents any help to emigrate, the parents slap them and send them to the street unable to help them. That's why poor boys sleep on the street, waiting to be able to sneak under a bus. But you don't sneak under a bus in an hour, or in minutes or days, sneaking under a bus can take months or even years. Imagine all that time living on the street while doing risky. This is the difference between some and others. Moroccan boys from wealthy families are sent in zodiac by their mothers while poor boys must risk their lives exposed to death, abuse, diseases… Many things just to be able to emigrate. This is the difference. Certainly we are seeing now more pressure. Previously it was one, two… But now they jump ten at a time. As you see, they go even without a life jacket. With whatever they're wearing. It seems it's going to be non-stop. With operation Paso del Estrecho, I think the flux of immigrants has increased. In the border, there are children of different ages who sleep on cardboards. Who is coming to help or cure them? People just stop to tell them: 'Glue boy, get back where you came from!' That's why our children die at sea, because of mistreatment, hunger, contempt and suffering. The boy gets up in the morning and sees his dad beat up his mum just because of two euros for the food. In his mind he tells himself that he prefers to die than live this bad life. I have been in Casablanca… I have been in Casablanca to work, but I slept on the street next to the police station, in the port, in the cold and the rain. I endured. I endured to work. I used to take fish buckets to sell them, also cigarettes. I also worked in a small restaurant. I didn't like Casablanca, there are only problems there. So I left the city. Then I went to Marrakech. There are not many jobs in Marrakech. I was in Jamaa El Fna square making juice in a stand. I was there for a week and left. I came back to Castillejos, where I stayed a couple of days, and went to Fez. I worked in Fez, in ceramics, but I wasn't well paid there either. 4 euros, 40 dirhams, 50, 60… a day. Half of my life has gone on the street. I don't know what the end of this will be, if it will end well or badly, or if I will die. I don't know. When I arrived, I phoned my mother to tell her I had succeeded. She knows I'm already a little man and I would arrived. It's her dream to see me like this. She awaits me and wants to see me to tell me: 'My son has bevahed like a man.' Many relatives have called me to ask me where I am already. In a while they'll call me again and I'll reply that I'm going to Madrid. Yesterday, when I got off the bus, I was thinking where to go and I found some Moroccans who helped me. I ate something and went to the Center for minors to visit my friends, they gave me clothes and we had a walk around Madrid. I smartened up then I phoned my mother to tell her that I had arrived in Madrid so that she could give me her blessing. Today I've been walking around Madrid and I've gone to the National Police to have them register me and get admitted into the Center for minors. I have relatives in Malaga, Tarragona, Fuengirola… Cordoba. But I don't depend on them to travel nor do I want to ask them for anything. I take care of myself, thank God. There are people who help you who take you wherever you want, who buy clothes for you… Regards to the boys who are abroad: Reda, Ismail… Salam aleikum, brothers who are abroad. Whoever wants to come here must change his mindset, must stay in the Center until he gets his documentation. I am now at the police station, I'm not 18 yet but I will get a residence permit. We've just had our fingerprints registered for the residence permit. I was so happy, this has been my greatest joy, having my residence permit and having it before turning 18. At 16 years of age, I'm here with my paperwork. There were often many boys fighting for a spot in just one risky and you had to fight and not be afraid of them, even if they were many. So we spent day after day, with abuse, attacks from boys from Ceuta, addictions, solvent... and abuse in the Center for minors. Why didn't I want to stay in the Center? I have friends from my hometown there but there are boys who abuse power. If you stay, you know you'll have to fight: 'this is mine, ' 'this is my place' and so on. The Center for minors there didn't lead me anywhere. You usually see boys of legal age who are registered as minors and maybe they have even committed murder in Morocco and they are among us. Salam alaikum mom, dad, I want you to give me your blessings and pray a lot for me. I know that your blessings brought me here. God willing, I'll come back to visit you. I know you will be very glad to see me and you'll be happy to know that I don't come back empty handed. I have you all here, you will never leave my heart. Since he was a child, he wanted to emigrate to Spain. He only thought about going to Spain. He used to ask me: 'Get my passport.' I said no, he better remains here to work and he used to tell me crying that he didn't want to. He used to run away from school, he didn't want to study. So I got his ID card and his passport and got him there. He was in the Center for minors for five months. We used to go to visit him and see him from afar because if the police saw us with him, they could accuse us of having left him there and I never wanted that. I would have preferred for him to remain at home with me than to leave for Spain desperately. But he didn't want to remain, he would say no, and that was it. He was sure that his future was not here, that his future is in Spain. This mindset is typical of a man so I give him my blessings. I just hope he becomes a man and I wish him to work for me and make me retire from the border. My brother wants to talk to the camera. He wants to do risky, he wants to come to Spain too and be with me in Madrid. He also wants to talk, okay? Speak slowly, say hello, say you want to cross, do risky… Say you want to leave Morocco because you have no studies and in Morocco there's nothing, so you want to enter Ceuta to study a course or look for life. Salam aleikum. I want to leave, I want to do risky and enter Ceuta… Not Ceuta, Spain. I want to arrive in Spain to seek a future because in Morocco there's nothing. I have not even studied, I want to go to Spain. Say you are 13 and a half. I'm 13 and a half years old. I want to go to Spain because here there's nothing, here we just sit to inhale glue, that's all. This is life in Morocco. I decided to take care of myself and get money on my own, because in Morocco nobody supports you, you are not valued. If you have money there, you'll live; if not, you won't. But that's normal there. I entered Ceuta to try to cross, of course. My mother wished me a lot of luck and that God help me. God has helped me. Now we're going to buy the ticket to Vitoria, God willing. There, boys are well treated and there aren't many minors. We thought that Barcelona would be better, that there would be subsidies, etc. When you are in Morocco and see your friends' pictures with good clothes, studying, with jobs… then you also want to come to Barcelona to look for a better future, to help your family… When some Moroccan boys arrived, they said that Barcelona was very good… -The others lie, yes. They say that Barcelona is better, that here you receive a lot of pocket money, that there's no need to steal… What is heard in Morocco is a lie, then you see there's nothing here just sleep on the street, no Center, you know? Everything is trouble, jail… Did you see the camera? Two boys sleep here every day. We sleep like this. There are people who sleep here. And some people in this hall, come. We sleep here. It smells really bad. You sleep like this. You close the curtain like this and that's it, to sleep. So that you are not woken up. So that you are not woken up. Barcelona is not good for boys of legal age, it is for minors. There are many Centers for minors, not for olders. Yes or no? Boys of legal age have to sleep on the street. Look, the security guards hit the boys with this. They keep it here to hit. Throw that shit or we will be put in jail. The police have stolen 40 euros from me and my bag with my phone and everything. Now I don't have my mother's phone number. Chaabi, chaabi! What's up brother? Why is that guy taking pictures? He came from Ceuta to visit me, brother. Are the boys OK? Give them my regards. We want support, sleep aid, food aid, a restaurant to eat, a place to sleep. I swear that this way none would steal. If it was so in Spain, none would steal. It would be better to have a future here, to do courses, to study… This way we would all have a job and none would steal, none! The policeman said: 'Get out of here!' We asked why he wanted us to leave and we told him that we would stay here. That's it, the police can fuck off. They come for us and let others stay. They said: 'This is only for Spaniards.' 'This place is only for Spaniards.' Are we not people or what? -What about us? Are we not people? Animals! We are animals! If you are not well here, you cannot say it. If you do it, your family will be told: 'Look at your son, he has gone there and has nothing.' That's why all boys lie, all of them lie saying that in Spain you are given clothes, food, housing… There are many people in Spain who are 18 and sleep on the street. The way it works here is: 'No paperwork, no job.' If you don't have paperwork, you cannot work, if you don't have paperwork, you cannot rent a flat. If you are Moroccan, you will sleep on the street, you will eat from the garbage and you will steal. The people here force us to live like this. We came in trailers, in hiding places where we risked our lives. Sometimes we even think of returning. They don't know what we go through to get here. We do risky risking our lives to get to this country and when we are here, we are called thieves, we are called foreigners and we have to sleep three months on the street to be helped. Muhammad our prophet talks of Hegira that means emigration; if you don't find a future here, you leave and look elsewhere. I got on a bus to go from Bilbao to San Sebastian, from there to Irun and from Irun to France. I'm much more afraid now than when I used to do risky. Now I can be detained and deported and I'd have to start again from scratch. I hope God help me along the way. As it is often said, may God take us to good people. There're no Arabs on the bus. It's difficult to find an Arab who can specify an address, a street to go… Who helps you and guides you a little. I'm in the hands of God. I only ask for one thing: not to be returned to Morocco. Friend, can you please tell me where Tabakalera is? - Tabakalera? - Yes. Here, behind. Thanks, friend. Staying in San Sebastian? I couldn't because I'm not a minor. Here you cannot live on the street. There's no Center for boys of legal age here. If I was a minor, I wouldn't have any problem. God willing, I'll go to France or Holland, just in case I may be presented as a minor. Then I wouldn't be on the street. How are you? And the family? Well? How are you doing? I've missed you, how are you? How are you sister? I miss you a lot. A friend has lent me his phone. I'm in San Sebastian now, I'm not in the place I was before, I'm in San Sebastian to pass to France. Until I arrive, don't tell anyone anything about me. I'll tell mom once I have arrived. If God helps me, from France I'll pass to Holland. Anyway, take care sister, I miss you. The border between France and Spain is a river… This is the border. But don't get it confused with this line. Coming from there you find a small river, that's not the border. The police are here many times, in this corner. They don't control the buses much, they look for blacks, not for Moroccans. -ID card? Passport? No, I'm new, I'm going to France. Where are you from? I'm Moroccan. - Morocco? - Yes. -Are you a minor or are you older? How old are you? -I'm a minor. I'm going to the Center for minors. I'll take your name. - Your name? - Nabil. Is Nabil the name? - April 30th, 2002, the date of birth? - Yes, yes. I'm a calm boy sir, I'm coming to France to the Center for minors for playing football. There are many Moroccans who play football in France and a lot of Algerians. I'm a calm boy sir. I hope for a future in France… Please. I've been detained for six or seven hours. The reason they gave me at the police station is that I wanted to leave Spain and I have no documentation. The French police detained me and took me to the Spanish police. I'll try to go to France again, I won't give up. People are very different here. They respect your rights. If you speak French, they bring you a French interpreter; if you speak Spanish, a Spanish one; and if it is Arabic, the same. They try to bring you someone who understands you. They brought me a lawyer though I have no money. Do you know from where? From San Sebastian and we are in Irun. The lawyer arrived late, but she arrived. She did her job and defended me. Now I've been allowed to leave, thank God. First I arrived in Algeciras, from there to Madrid. From Madrid to Vitoria. In Vitoria the treatment was bad. We were demanded some document to prove that we were minors, we were not allowed to stay there. We woke up in the morning and we were again asked to provide documentation. We were not allowed to enter, we were left in the street. We were on the street for a week and then we went to San Sebastian. How can you get that documentation if your mother is far away and you have just arrived? We were given no choice, no choice but to leave. In San Sebastian more of the same; the police picked us up and took us to the register to sign us, then they took us to the Center for minors. We were supposed to stay in the Center for five months but we felt overwhelmed in that Center so we decided to look for money to travel and go to France. We went by train. The train we took arrived in Paris. In Paris we were looking for life, Moroccan people helped us. We were there a couple of days sleeping on the street with a lot of cold. Then we looked for money to go to Belgium. In Belgium we only remained for one night. Upon arrival, we started to beg to get money for the ticket to Germany. In Germany the police detained us, they took our fingerprints, did the red tape… And finally they brought us to the Center. A Center, at last, thank God. We came to seek a living here but we will come back to Spain because here no documentation is made for minors. Everything I do is for documentation, you cannot live without paperwork forever. In Spain, in Catalonia, people help a lot, it is said that people help a lot. In Spain, you can have your paperwork done to live there. They help those in need. We'll have a bad time but, at the end, we will have our paperwork and we'll be able to go wherever we want. When I heard on the ship speaker: 'Algeciras!', I felt great and I got off the ship in front of the police as a minor. Although I was 17, I told them I was 14. I know how things are… I've tried to cross for three years, three years at the border. Almost four years trying. It's not easy. I didn't even spend the holidays with my parents. I would rather die than go back to Morocco... I would rather jump off the plane than be repatriated. If I go back to Morocco it will be with my documentation. Fuck the envious. We parted ways in Morocco, met in Spain and then met again in Sweden. It's a present from my girlfriend. What is her name? - Alexandra. - Alexandra? Cool! That's good! Put it, put it. It's made of gold. - It costs a lot of money, right? - Yes. Your girlfriend has a lot of money. It's 24-carat gold. - That good! What a girlfriend you have! - A lot of money. - Like Mohamed VI's. - No no, she's my girlfriend. His father is a policeman. - Oh, a policeman? - Yes. - Then take this present too, take my money, what else do you want? What are you saying, man! Is it really that your girlfriend gave you this gold? Here there are… 20 grams or so. -Regards to all our friends in Paris. With you… Yeri. Long live the boys! Be good! We are all the same, we are foreigners. Harraga, harraga. All the boys like life here. You don't know anything about my life. Yes, I have stolen and I have done many bad things but you, motherfucker, you have parents who give you everything and cover your needs. Your father may be a policeman or a prime minister. You have a mother who wakes you up and gives you money. If you have the balls, spend a single night on the street, you would call your parents to help you. I've been on the street for a year, I have not seen my family. I have spent the holidays and even Ramadan on the street. I'm sure if you spent an hour on the street, you would call Mom and Dad to help you, motherfucker. That's it, Alfredo. What do you usually do here during the day? You know brother, just freedom, sleeping, going to school… Football, I play football here. What do you study? I study Swedish… and English. That's good, right? - It is. - Of course. What do you want to do here in Sweden? I want to get paperwork. Why? To work, to visit Morocco. To do many things, with paperwork. For example? Don't you know? What would I do with paperwork? First I will visit Morocco. I will work. - In Morocco? Yes, I will… No! Not working in Morocco! I won't go back to Morocco. In Sweden you live very well, not in Spain, I swear. In Spain there is a lot of problems, you know? You don't have money, in the Center you only get 12 euros a week. With 12 euros you can buy almost nothing… I was in a Center in Barcelona and I used to get 10 euros a week, here it is far better… Boys don't have money nor anything there, they only steal. They steal, steal, steal; one case, two cases… After three cases, you go to a detention center. Until you come of age, then you are sent to Morocco. Where is that? In Barcelona, in Madrid, in all Spain. I did eight cases in Madrid. - You? - Eight cases. If you steal, you'll be sent to Morocco, you have to think about it. Are you going to steal? If you steal a lot: diamonds… Rolex, Richard… You will pay for it. The one who thinks: 'I'm going to mug this man, ' the one who thinks that, will pay for it. That's clear. If you steal today, tomorrow and next week, for two years, three years… Then you will pay for it. Do you know how much is the pocket money here? 30 euros. 30 euros. Listen… in a week here you will receive 70 euros. - A week? 70 euros and a half. Yes, a week. At the end of the month, how much will you collect? At the end of the month you can go to buy clothes. Not to buy clothes made in China but clothes from Nike or any brand. Where are you? About of this kids, they sometimes tell us that they have... they are in contact with their families and... I mean, I've been working with this for seven years but I still don't understand allways the reason: Why they are in Europe? Some people tell me that is a culture thing, but is difficult to understand because a lot of this kids come, they stay... some of them only stay a few days, some stay one month, some stay three months, then their friend from another country calls, and tell them that the live in that country is much better. All of them come to that culture. They have none when they're lived here, they have a home. They have their friends nearby, they've activities, playing football, going to school... They have a lot of help from the social services, but still they are unhappy and one day gets all of these assists, and everything becomes calm, a lot about other problems comes. They start thinking about their family, they start thinking about other things reflecting on, but there been true, they feel it's unfaire, to have so much problems when just being a kid. This kids are happily a lot of them, and never have been able to be just kids, and life a normal live. I think a good solution would be for the countries, for Europe, to try to help then in Morocco. I don't really know what the real way is for them, and what we can do but... we are doing our best. To be honest, when I'm on Facebook and I see the videos of my friends abroad, I see them stronger, whiter, handsomer, they dress well, live well… When I see them I don't feel envious but I feel frustration and I wish… I wish I was like them, at their level, to be with them. The truth is that I miss them a lot. When I remember them, my heart aches inside. After everything we went through together, and in the end, to see your friends like that and see that you have not taken any steps forward… Makes you think of wasted time and many other things… And it makes you feel such heartache that it makes you sick inside. Nothing of value remains, only the desire to reach abroad and sit next to your friends, with whom you lived so many things. Close the door, please. Take a sit, Ismail. I'm going to give you good news: Firstly… Your documentation has been renewed for a year, until July 12th, 2020. Other good news: you are going to the Peninsula, you are going on Friday to a flat in Jerez. Are you happy? - Yes, a lot. On Friday morning. Tomorrow I'll tell you the departure times of the ship, of the helicopter or whatever. Finally, congratulations. Do you remember how you were before? Look at you now. Do you remember last year by these dates when I picked you up from the hospital and you didn't want to come? You wanted to stay on the street… You have achieved all of this by staying here, that's it. Congratulations! Give me a hug, man! Well, whose birthday is it today? What a joy, right? Come on, let's… Let's celebrate, okay? Great. Ismail! Ismail! Ismail! Does anyone have a lighter? Nobody has one, nobody smokes… How are you? - How are you? - Fine, thank God. - Were you sleeping? - Yes. I've spent all night at customs. - Hello Fatima. - Hello, how are you, good? Today I have to tell you something. God willing I'm going to Spain. God willing. God willing, I will go only if it's in my destiny. You have made me happy. Happiness. Much, much, much, much happiness… I was afraid that everything you went through would come to nothing. Don't worry, don't cry. God closes a door and opens another. Handsome! My handsome boy. I feel like holding you and scream of happiness! And remembering when I carried you on my back. Take care, Ismail!
