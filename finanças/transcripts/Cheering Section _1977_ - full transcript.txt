Why you're always the last one dressed ? - I thought I could do my public. - Bullshit. You know how I really like to date with that new chick. Corey might come on a little strong at first, but don't worry about it. That's just his personality. I wonder what's taking them so long. They're worst then girls. She's standing over there with Terry right now. Why won't you ask her? Listen, if she comes with us, you drive. Gotcha. Let's go. Does Corey have a steady girlfriend? No, but he's always looking for one. Me too. - Afternoon, ladies. - Good afternoon. I told Melanie we'd give her a ride home. Sure. I'll take the keys and I'll drive. Yeah, why don't you? How was practice today? Oh, was little rough for the first day. How about you? That new coach is a nut. Really? You wouldn't believe it, Terry, really. Your approach is a little primitive, don't you think? It's no big deal. Uh, Terry, did you send away those applications yet? No, I should have. Putting it off, I guess. Write me when you're gone, please. Oh, cut the shit, huh? Hey, Jeff, make a right at the next corner. Okay, Melanie. - See you, guys ! - Bye ! Bye ! Okay, let's go. You wanna drive? Nah, let's take Terry home first. - Terry ! - Yeah ? Did Melanie saying anything about coming here tonight ? No. How could she ? She's got to *** today. Yeah... She doesn't even know about this place yet. Okay, here's my 15 bucks. - That makes $60 for the month. - I'll take that. Alright, it's time to do the drawing for the schedule. One at a time. No looking, no looking ! These guys are to much. You know, when we graduate, they go to donate that band to the school as a monument. I can see it all now. A little plaque right in the side of the van, *** little pussycats, in memory of all the girls in the class of 1977. Jeff, you're gross. Looks like Tim and Jill are finally getting their act together. Please, let's go over there. Oh, no, Tim, I'm not going to go through that again. Jill, your promised. No, I will. We'll just have to find a better place. Hey, Buzz, you ain't holding up your end, man. You had the van all last week, and you didn't score. Yeah, so I had a bad week. What do you want from me? What's the matter, Buzz? You losing your touch? It was because it was Labor Day, and everybody was away. I'm going to go out to my van. Um, fix my tape deck. Corey, can I give you a hand? Cheer up, Timmy. We'll make it soon. Just has to be tension up a little longer. Good morning. There will be a car wash held by the cheerleaders this Saturday at Sam's gas station so that they can afford to buy uniforms. Now, I know we'd all like to see them without uniforms, but we have to have them. So that's this Saturday, and that's from nine until five. Thank you. Hi there. Come on, we'll be late for class. Yeah, we'll be late together. I don't want to be anything together. Oh, Melanie ! Hey, what do you want? Good morning. Get lost. Hey, all I want to tell you is there's a couple of guys putting dogs shit in the car back there. Dog shit? Asshole ! Thanks. Listen, I'm really sorry about yesterday. Do you want to make up for it? How? Well, how about a do-boogie ride? - All right. - Great. Get your books. We're going to get out of here. Hurry up, we're going to be late. I don't want to push you, but I want to make you perfectly clear. I got something to tell you, and I want to make sure you hear.

Oh come on ! Quiet down ! Quiet down ! Today's lesson is of prime importance. *** I apologize for my tardiness, but I certainly appreciate your holding down the force. I'm Ms. McKenzie. I'm your substitute teacher for today's class. Ms. Toulet will probably be back tomorrow. Now for today's lecture, Communication and Sex. We all know that an important part of communication is the use of words. Their meaning and how different and how words may have different meaning for different people. Thank you. Keep it down. As you can see by your own reaction, these words which have specific meanings listed in any dictionary appear to have some different meanings to some of you. Let's discuss the definition of communication. Communication could... Jeff, please put away your toys until after school. And Corey, please take your seat. Okay. Communication could be verbal or non-verbal interaction... Let's declare a truce and end the war. We'll meet tonight and even a score. If there's only one, be sure there's no more. Class, pay attention. Verbal or non-verbal interaction between two people. Cool it. Lecture's kind of interesting. We'll talk about it at... Up ! Up ! Down ! Six ! Up one! Victory! Victory! Good play! Good play! A little enthusiasm here. Let's go! Let's go here ! I'll go back! I'll go back! What do you think we ought to do about it? I don't know. They might be trying to suck us into something. I guess all we can do is hang loose and be prepared for anything. Hey, you gonna have any trouble making it? No. I'll meet you at nine o'clock. Hey, Ms. McKenzie. Hi. Oh, Buzz, isn't it? From 3rd period sex education? That's right. I really enjoyed your lecture in class today. You sure know what's going on. Why, thank you, Buzz. I derive a lot of satisfaction when I can communicate with you young people. Say, um, can I give you a ride home? Oh, no thanks. My car's parked right over here. Is that your van? Well, it's part mine. All the guys in the 4F club own a piece of it. All right, I want a good pop here. I want everybody together in unison now. Set! Hut! Oh, no good, no good at all. Get back.

You've got a smart mouth, punk. Thank you. You know what I had to do? I ought to break your face. Well, you should have brought some help, pal. You wonder why chivas are all like. We're all here, Jeff baby. Now that we got the bullshit out of the way, what do you want? A chance to get even. How? Up the stakes a little. I hear ya. If we win, we get Jewish youth leaders. And if we win? Don't worry about it. It'll never happen. What do you say ? Sure. Hey, like what happened? Would you guys have hung around with those odds? Yeah, this is the way to know. Listen, you want to catch a bite at Farmsy's ? Hey, would I ever refuse a good hamburger? All right, we'll catch you later. - See you later. - No problem. What's the story, Jeff? Like we figured, it was a setup and they copped out. Are you coming eat with us later too? Hey, I wish I could, but I gotta get Melanie home. Okay, I'll catch you. Come on, Terry. - Good bye, Melanie! - Good bye ! Don't go just yet. I promised I'd be home early. You are. - Okay, but only five minutes. - Great. Come on back and listen to some music.

We weren't doing anything. Ah, nothing ? Just kissing. Oh, Christ, Corey, I can make up a better one than that. I know. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. You want my advice? No. Forget her. She's going to be more hazardous to health than smoking. Sure was a shock to find out your dad was a coach. The kings are here. Yeah, I would say it was really a shock for Corey, too. Remember what I told you this time. I will. See you later. Bye. Corey, wait! Listen, I'm really sorry about last night. Forget it. Sometimes I thought it was some strange thing. I'll see you later.
