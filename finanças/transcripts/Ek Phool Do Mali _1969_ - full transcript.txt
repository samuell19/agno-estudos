We couldn't save neither the mother nor the child. It is such a sad thing. His wife as well as his child, both died. And then nature has been harsh to him. Well, doctor, won't he be cured in a month or so? - He may be cured, but... - But what? - He won't be fit for marriage. - What? Yes. Now his house will always be devoid of children. Son, peace resides inside your mind. But when it moves away from the mind.. The mind searches for it in scenery. Our hermits also went to the Himalayas for attaining peace. The Himalayas are a constant sea of happiness and peace. Even the most impatient of persons could.. Go there and be lost in unique peace. "The ways of fate are strange, my brother." "The ways of fate are strange, my brother." "Who can change what is given in fate, my brother?" "The ways of fate are strange, my brother." "In the hands of fate the line of the world exists." "Before fate you cant do anything." "Everything is with it, my brother." "The ways of fate are strange, my brother." "The morning of happiness that is given in fate." "Until when will this darkness of sorrow prevail?" "Someday we will get light, my brother." "The ways of fate are strange, my brother." "This is a true pilgrimage on high Himalayas." "This is the mind's temple." "It is a shrine for happiness." "Search for everything here, my brother." "The ways of fate are strange, my brother." "The ways of fate are strange, my brother."

Since 7 years, this mountaineering club.. Is not going on due to my care but rather due to.. Your young courageousness. These enormous mountains are spread like.. The uncertainties in life. But those who have courage, ambitions... They get the path as well as the destination. Our this earth which is touching the skies.. People from far away come to reach it. This is Mr. Amar Kumar. He has come from Africa for mountaineering. Basic mountaineering is of 5 types. Rock climbing. Rock rappelling. Snow climbing. Snow rappelling. Ski climbing. Now. Can anyone of you tell me.. With what should we start first? Yes, sir. Rock climbing. Look! Listen! That... that... Why are you saying, 'that'? I have a name. Look, Ms. Somna, our ball has come here. It has come. Now it is going away. You are strange! Give us our ball and then leave. - Why should I give it to you? - This ball is ours. But it has entered our garden. Oh! So anything that enters your garden becomes yours? It surely does. Should I come in then? Come in then. I'll make you an apple and hang you on a tree. I accept. But you will have to take my care. I'll eat you raw. Where are you going? Give me the ball. Am I your servant to pick your ball and.. Keep throwing it around? The ball has been coming here repeatedly. It is as if this is not a plot but a playground. You won't get the ball. Hey! Listen. I am telling you, you'll repent. From where did this ball come? From our garden. Are balls grown in the garden? Whose is it? Those mountaineering school people. When it is Sunday, they get their limbs. They want to play Cricket. Why are you harassing them? - Go and return it to them. - No mother. Now I'll take it to Mr. Kailash. I'll aggravate the matter and complain. Forget about staying here, I'll make it difficult.. For them to even stay here. Don't disturb Mr. Kailash with these small things. Has he done less favours to us. After your father died, if we wouldn't have.. Got support from him through this apple garden.. I don't know what would have happened to us. May Mr. Kailash live a long life. Greetings, sir. - Tell me Goran, how are you? - I'm good. - Is Mr. Kailash here? - Yes, he is. Come in, sir. - Hello Kialash! - Hello Doctor. - How are you? - You can have a look. The illness has increased due to medicine. It has been 5 years since your medication has begun. But is there any chance of cure! Do you think I am a fool? Should I cure you and be ill myself? My dear friend, it is only due to rich people.. Like you that my dispensary is moving. Doctor, since yesterday evening I have a little cough. And my stomach is also upset. It appears that you have done something again. Absolutely not. You must be sleeping late at night. I go to sleep early. Then you have certainly started having cigars. Cigar? It has been a long time since I left smoking. I have even forgotten its name. And if we searched for it, we wouldn't even.. Find any piece of it in this house. Isn't it so? Doctor, did you see the new Life magazine? There is a very nice article on surgery. I have read it. There is something stuck in my throat. I'll remove it right now. Isn't this what was stuck in your throat? Cant you stop smoking a cigar? - Cigar? How did it come here? - Who kept it here? I'll ask someone. Goran! Wait! There is no need to ask anyone. Ask your heart. Why don't you leave this habit of yours? Why have you become the enemy of your life? I have told you a thousand times. A cigar or cigarette is poison for you. It is death! But you don't understand. Even though you are learned, you act illiterate. Doctor, you did a good thing by scolding me. I really need to learn something. I won't repeat such a mistake again. - Forgive me. - You forgive me. Go and search for another doctor. You cant improve and I cant treat you. - I'm very sorry. - Friend, why do you need to be so serious? You told me to stop smoking a cigar. I'll stop this cigar from today. There! I'll hold my ears. - Is it a promise? - A certain promise. At least have tea. Shamsher Singh? Are you scared? [Laughing] I haven't come to take. I have come to give you something. They are not Indian. They are foreign pieces. [Sighs] A Rolex watch, Switzerland. Bronson lighter, Germany. Yon Fob knife, China. I really want to be your lifetime client of yours. But I cant be one. Why? Because my father said this when he died. Son, be a smuggler but never buy goods.. That have been smuggled. Bahadur Singh, give me a box of Surf. Who rung this shenai (musical instrument)? Somna! Really, what a movement you have. As if storms have been combined into clothes. Are you teasing me again? It isn't my fault. Wax has to melt before fire. Bahadur Singh, why do you let thugs enter your shop? Shamsher Singh, please go away from here now. It's a time for sales. I'll lose my customers. Don't be afraid. I'll make a wall through my.. Heart and make it stand in between. I'll tie it with a thread of my love. I'll pull your tongue. Stop your nonsense! There, I have shut it. Speaking is not allowed, touching isn't. [Slapping] You ruffian! Oh Ram! Who took away the apples from this tree? What a bowling have you done! You have made a pile of wickets! [All Laughing] The lady of wickets is coming. So, from where did all these apples come? From whose garden are they? Why are you looking around? I'm asking you. Have you ever even looked at such apples? Give me an answer. Cant you hear? Are you deaf? Are you dumb too? Why are you shaking your hands? Speak something. Tell me something somebody. Look at your faces. You look like a evil group. Rascals, snitches, thieves! And you! You look like a thief by your face. You are the main thief! You greedy man! Aren't you ashamed to eat stolen stuff? If God wishes, you'll be mute and deaf. But remember, I am better than you assume me to be. I'll return the deal down to the last cent. My name is Somna. [All Laughing] What mistake has this poor guy done? You should have taken him with you. Will I let a thief enter my home? I am not that stupid. But what are you doing? - I'm taking revenge. - Revenge? Are you taking revenge by stealing? Yes, I am stealing. But the room was shut. How did you come in? I crossed the walls and came through the window. If someone would see you taking these stolen items? I am not afraid of anyone. My name is Somna. - The basket is small. - I'll get a bigger basket. Oh ho! Wait! Turn here. Not this hand. Give me that hand. [Voice Over The Tape Recorder] I am not afraid of anyone. My name is Somna. Hey! I was saying that. From where did that noise come? - From this thing. - From here? [Tape Recorder On] Listen. I crossed the walls and came through the window. Oh Ram! I have such a good voice. So, is this a machine for filling in voice. No. It's a machine for catching thieves. Is that so? How are thieves caught? The police matches this voice with the thief's voice. And catches him immediately. I have understood it. Now this machine will go to the police. - Why? - You will be punished through this. My punishment? Why? Because you have made a theft. And what about the apples that you stole? Will nothing be done about that? You have no proof regarding that. And I do. [Tape Recorder On] Are you taking revenge by stealing? Yes, I am stealing. Oh Ram! Your voice has been arrested. Now you will be arrested. Arrested? Police station. The court. Jail. Strict imprisonment for 6 months. Chains in your hands. Handcuffs on your hands. The police will catch you from the market and.. Pull you towards the jail gate and push you inside. No-no! Don't do that! I won't be able to face anyone. Here, I'll keep all your stuff. Take my basket too. There is no use of repenting. The thief will be punished. For God's sake, forgive me. I fold hands before you. I hold my ears. Don't hand me to the police. Nothing can be done now. - But something can be done. - What can be done? The same that happens in movies. What happens in movies? When the girl becomes helpless, she sings a song. A song? No, I won't sing a song. You won't sing? Listen. Listen! Listen. Listen! What is it? Actually, the song that I remember, is a love song. And I am shy to sing it before you. Really? There is no need to be shy. You are not singing by your own accord. You will be singing due to helplessness. Yes. That's true. Start then. [Song Singing] No, no, no. Girls don't sing like that in movies. How do they sing then? She sings with attitude and grace with a dance. No! I cant dance like that. "Darling, your first look took away my life." "Darling, your first look took away my life." "You made such magic over me, you are a magician." "Darling, your first look took away my life." "You made such magic over me, you are a magician." "Darling, your first look took away my life." "First, you appeared to be like a dream." "Now, you appear to be my own." "First, you appeared to be like a dream." "Now, you appear to be my own." "Take me by holding my hands." "Darling, wherever you want to." "Darling, your first look took away my life." "You made such magic over me, you are a magician." "Darling, your first look took away my life." "I have agreed to what you said." "I don't know what it is in your eyes." "I have agreed to what you said." "I don't know what it is in your eyes." "I forgot about my condition in your love." "Darling, your first look took away my life." "You made such magic over me, you are a magician." "Darling, your first look took away my life." "Darling, your first look took away my life." What are you searching for? Your husband is sitting here. I am not looking for you. I'm looking for your pampered daughter. - She isn't here too. - So? That's it. You sit here and show your doctoring. Are you aware what goes on in your home? When she gets a chance and disappears. Tell her clearly. Make use of an opportunity but not much. You are still stupid. I am taking about that Bahadur Singh. That general merchant has made such magic over.. Shobha that she doesn't feel good inside her home. I'd say that if the illness of love gains roots.. No medication will be of help. - We'll perform an operation. - What? I mean we'll have her married. Married? To that small time shopkeeper? My son-in-law will be a minister. At least a deputy minister. Don't trust the ministry madam. The person who sits down may disappear in a flash. And a shopkeeper will be a shopekeeper.. Even in his next life. I won't be fooled by your talk. I am going straight to that recycler. - Listen to me! - You don't need to intervene. This is my personal matter. Did you understand? [Groaning] I'm dead! Oh ho! Why are you sitting and staring? Help me get up. How can I help you get up? It is your personal matter. Bahadur Singh. Bahadur Singh. Bahadur Singh! Amazing! Is it your voice or a veil of beauty. What? Who are you? Where is Bhadur Singh? Him? He who used to sell medication for.. The heart has moved his shop on. I mean, he has gone away. - He has gone? - Absolutely. But this forever young man is ready to serve you. Tell me, what can I give you? Powder? Lipstick? Cream? Dear man, give me this beautiful beard of yours. Shobha darling, you are really cruel. You don't look by your eyes but your heart. That is why my father said to me as he died. Son, you can hide from everyone. But you can't ever hide from the police and eyes of love. [Chuckling] But what is the need to be in a disguise? I was afraid of your mother. Until when will you be scared of her? - Until your mother is alive. - What? I mean until you and I aren't married. [Chuckling] How can we get married? You don't even talk to my mother. You are only brave by your name. What are you saying. Lets go right now and talk. - But no. - Why? Because my father said as he was dying. Son, be in a hurry to fall in love. But never hurry to get married. Otherwise you will be in a problem. Has Shobha come here? Where are you going to? If I get one hit from your mother, I'll be half-dead. Where is Bahadur Singh? Mummy, Bahadur Singh has gone. He has gone? We'll find out right now where he has gone to. Oh no! Where will he escape? If I don't break his bones I'm not Champa Devi. I have found him! It's a statue, mother. - It's a statue! - A statue? Well, even if it is a statue, I'll take revenge from him. Wow! Such a firmness in a flat nose? Its made of rubber, mother. Rubber. - Of rubber? - Yes. But it appears to be real. Even his ears are real. His hair is also real. - Does he speak? - How can he speak, mother? He is a statue, a statue. - He'll speak now. - Mother! Mother, if his legs break down, we will.. Have to pay a lot of money. How can they break? Aren't they made of rubber? Oh mother! Stop it, mother. Stop. Stop. Hit the real one with the remainder. Alright. Look, tell that person with the real face. Stop pursuing my daughter. I had mercy on you. But I won't pity him! - Come on! - Mother! Let it be. I'll pick it by myself. At times, one should help another. You are a very good man. You are very bad too! [Laughing] Am I a good and bad person at the same time? You are good because that day you left me. You are bad because due to you I had to suffer scolding. - Who scolded you? - My mother did. My mother found out that I entered your room. How? Did she look? I told her. I was scolded a lot. - You had to be. - She told me, he forgave such a big mistake. A good man like him should have been brought home. - Really? - Yes. And she also said that if you ever see him again.. Surely bring him to meet me. I was scared. This turned out to be good news. Alright, I'll leave. Listen. Won't you come home? Not today. Some other day. - Why? - I feel bad going with you this way. Only people who have a snitch in.. ..their heart will feel bad. Our hearts are absolutely clear. Aren't they? Yes. They are totally clear. - Come on then. - Come on. That day if your ball wouldn't have come to our garden.. We wouldn't have met each other. It is all a chance of fate. Come on. Come in. Assume this to be your home. Sit down. Sit calmly. I'll call mother and return. What'll you drink? Tea or coffee? No, that won't be required. How is that possible? A guest who comes home has to be treated a little. Whatever you wish then. Why did you shut the door? Somna! Open the door. I said open the door! [Chuckling] Now this door will be opened before everyone. - Why? - Because you will be greeted by blows. You will be beaten so bad that your nose, ears.. Eyes, will all be cleared. But what is my fault? You entered a respectful girl's home in broad daylight. This is not a small fault. - It is a big mistake. - But I haven't entered your home. You brought me here. I did bring you here. But what evidence do you have? Nothing! You thought that the poor girl has fallen in love. You are very beautiful, aren't you? I'll call everyone right now. Hari! Deenu! Ram! Get stick and come here. Look a thief has entered our home. Somna, what are you doing? It is a matter of my respect. I fold hands before you. I had also folded hands. Then you can have a condition too. If you want to you may listen to my song. I don't want to listen to your song. I want to hear you crying. You used to say that this happens in movies. That is what happens in movies. And you will know now what happens outside movies. Mother! Oh Mother! Come quickly mother. What is it, Somna? Oh no! Mother really came! What now? Somna! Come on. Let me hide you! Mother shouldn't find you. - Wait here! No one comes here. - Alright. - Mother! - What happened? Why did you call for me? Mother, I didn't look at you for a long time. You crazy girl. Come on. We are getting late to go to the temple. Yes, come quickly. We are getting very late. Where are you going? At least let me take a plate for the prayers. - I'll get it. - Why should you get it? [Door Opens] Come on. - What happened? - Nothing, its nothing. Come on, come! Mother, I'll come soon. [Whistling] You are hanging here? I was scared. Hey Somna! Hurry up. The time for prayers will be over. I'm coming mother! Look, we are going to a temple. I'll leave the door open. You run away. Listen. When will you meet me again? What were you doing? I was shutting the window. You shut the window and are leaving the door open? Shut it. Put on the latch. Let it be, mother. Who comes around here? Don't talk too much. Put on the latch. Mother, I'll come around. Where are you going now? The main door is open. Should I go and shut it quickly? That door is always open. What is different today? Yes. It is always open. Come on! Greetings, Mr Kailash. Greetings, aunt Leela. Are you well? Yes. It is due to your grace. Somna, greet Mr. Kailash. - Greetings. - Greetings. What were you thinking about? What? Its nothing. How is that? Your face tells me there is something. Aunt Leela, she is hiding something from us. What is it? Tell us. What should I say? There is nothing to be said. Mother, I left the sugar outside. I had kept it inside. But I kept it out again. Oh! If it rains all the sugar will flow away. There is already a scarcity of sugar. - Go on quickly! - Ok. She has become very homely, aunt Leela. "Remove this veil." "Show me your face." "Remove this veil." "Show me your face."

You would be pleased to hear that Mr. Kailashnath.. Has announced that he will reward all children.. Who have taken part in the race. Three cheers for Mr. Kailashnath. Hip-hip hooray! Hip-hip hooray! Hip-hip hooray! Thank you. Thank you. Attention please. Kindly pay attention. Now a father's race is about to start. Hence, fathers are requested to go immediately.. To the position of the race. Thank you. Hey! Mr. Kailash didn't go. How can he go. He doesn't have a child. Kailash, why did you leave the function and come here? I was just reminded of some important task. Sitting quietly and alone, isn't that your important task? - Actually the thing is doctor... - I know what it is. Looking at children you crave for them. But you have a solution for this thirst. Adopt some child. He will dance and play around in this home. You will feel occupied. No doctor. I won't let my shadow of bad luck fall on any child. You have yourself raised this wall of bad luck. You can have your own children too. Get married. - Doctor... - Today I won't be quiet. You aren't very old. You could accept some widow. Someone of your age can be your partner. She cant be doctor. How do I explain it to you? This journey of mine is not a voyage. It is a steady destination. - Kailash! - Leave me on my own. I am well on my own. I don't have anyone before me nor after. Neither is anyone related to me nor am I to anyone. I have got such a good life, doctor. I am not concerned about my condition. Nor am I afraid about the future. I don't have any problem in life. I don't have any dreams at all. "Help this poor man." "Your world will be joyous." "With children's cries, your home may echo." "People with children, may you prosper." "People with children, may you prosper." "People with children, may you prosper." "People with children, may you prosper." "This hungry beggar has only this wish." "People with children, may you prosper." "People with children, may you prosper." "May your home be full with children." "May this garden always be green." "May your home be full with children." "May this garden always be green." "The child, a doll, a drum and a motor." "May there be a constant noise." "May there be a constant noise." "This hungry beggar has only this wish." Stop it! Stop singing that. Don't sing this song here. Your prayers will crash with these walls and return. They cant flourish in this house. Don't waste your prayers. Here. [Tomtom] So, Bahadur Singh. What is news? The news is very old. My father had said this when he died. Son, whenever a mountain of problems overcomes you.. Play this drum and gather people. You will get a person who can show you.. The right way among them. Oh no! A worthless deal and a worthless drum. I had thought that it must be something for our good. Come on! Come along. [Indistinct Chattering] Hey uncle! Oh uncle! Oh ladies! Listen to me before you leave! [Birds - Chirping] Listen to me! Hey, Bahadur Singh! What is all this drama? I have been trapped in a difficulty of love. I am beating my hands and feet. Why? Did Shobha refuse to marry you? No-no! Her mother and her have both given their assent. But the condition that is laid is that.. Either I should climb a mountain or.. I should fight with Jaggu the wrestler. There is no trouble in that. Come along with us. Climb a mountain. I can't even climb onto a donkey. How would I climb on a mountain? Oh! Then fight with the wrestler. I swear by you, I will be beaten into a paste! You are strange! These days man has started buying off God. You cant even buy off a wrestler? How is that? Warm your hand, the wrestler will be softer. "Warm your hand, the wrestler will be softer." [Laughing] Wow! You are incomparable! - Shall I go? - Yes! His pulse seems to be sinking. He will be living only for 5-10 minutes more. That will be good! We will be rid of this trouble forever. You will be in more trouble, madam. If he dies, the hands of the police will.. Come onto your neck. Why? He didn't die. He was murdered. He has been turned into a squash! [Yelling] Oh! 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, 28. Look at that. The poor guy is counting his last breath. Madam, you are responsible for his death. If you hadn't laid a condition, he wouldn't.. Have fought a wrestler and he wouldn't have died. Now you cant be saved from the law. Darned man wouldn't even spare me after his death. What are you looking at? Give him a few injections and make him stand up. My Bahadur, die bravely. We couldn't unite when we were alive. We will surely meet after death. Worshipper of love, your idolizer is coming after you. - Shobha! - My daughter! Its poison! Its poison! - Poison? - She has consumed poison. Oh Ram! She took poison! Go on! Get a lemon. Something sour can destroy the poison. Alright. Daddy, how was my acting? Perfect, my child. Perfect! - And what about me? - Realistic. Very real! Oh! I found a lemon after a lot of trouble. Make her drink it quickly. Have her drink it quickly, my child. What has happened? There is no hope. What? Oh Ram! I am doomed, I am ruined! You have been ruined due to your own fault. You are the one who made her drink poison. Her case will also be made against you. You won't be hung up once but twice. - Twice? - Absolutely twice. For god's sake save their lives and save me too. You are a doctor, aren't you? Now its not the time for medicine but for prayers. Only god can stop these lives that are about to be lost. - Go. Go and pray. - Prayers? Alright! Oh God, save my daughter. And this man... No! Don't let this true brave man die too. I swear! I promise by your feet. If these people become alright, I'll have them married. [Chant] Do you know where this photograph will go? - Where will it go? - To my parents. Why? So that they may like their future daughter-in-law. [Chuckling] But what if your mother has selected some.. Other girl for you? I cant break my mother's heart. So, will you break my heart? No, I'll keep you both happy. Both of us? How? I'll marry that girl and you too. One that my mother likes and one that I do. [Laughing] Ok, tell me something. Do you have such a big car? - Not such a big one. - You will have it later. Do you have a big house? Like Mr. Kailash's home? - My house isn't that big either. - You will have it later. I have been dreaming from such a long time. And in that home - there will be a garden. And in that garden there will be colourful flowers. And among those flowers another flower will grow. And I will play with these flowers all day and night. I will play with them too. No! you cant play with them. Why? Don't I have a right too? I am their father. So what? A mother has more rights. I would say... oh Ram! You are very shameless! What would anyone who listens say about that? He would say that we are both very shameless. Aunt Leela. I have found a boy for Somna. - What? - He is a very good boy. He is a member of our mountaineering club. - You know him too. - Amar? Yes, Amar. Somna will be very happy with him. Actually, they both love each other a lot. [Tomtom] "Oh darling, my beloved." "I am lost in your love, darling." "Due to you, I have become a sage." "Now what is to happen will happen, beloved." "Now this connection won't be broken." "Now this relation won't be broken." "Oh darling, my beloved." "I am lost in your love, darling." "Due to you, I have become a sage." "Now what is to happen will happen, beloved." "Now this connection won't be broken." "Now this relation won't be broken." "As soon as I met you I lost my calm of nights." "Your magic of lovely talk has done its trick." "As soon as I met you I lost my calm of nights." "Your magic of lovely talk has done its trick." "I am lost in your love, darling." "Due to you, I have become a sage." "Now what is to happen will happen, beloved." "Now this connection won't be broken." "Now this relation won't be broken." "When a bird sings for his lover." "It looks like I am going to lose my life." "When a bird sings for his lover." "It looks like I am going to lose my life." "Oh darling, my beloved." "I am lost in your love, darling." "Due to you, I have become a sage." "Now what is to happen will happen, beloved." "Now this connection won't be broken." "Now this relation won't be broken." "The fairs of this world won't be seen alone." "Only with you, I will like all colours." "The fairs of this world won't be seen alone." "Only with you, I will like all colours." "Oh darling, my beloved." "I am lost in your love, darling." "Due to you, I have become a sage." "Now what is to happen will happen, beloved." "Now this connection won't be broken." "Now this relation won't be broken." "Oh darling, my beloved." [Rainfall] It is like a pair of the sun and the moon. As if they are partners for their whole life. I'll write to Amar today itself that we like the girl. And also write to him that the wedding.. Is fixed for the next month. So start making the preparations.. ..from today onwards. Look, I will select the clothes for the bride. And I will select the bridegroom's wear. [Laughing] I will make all my wishes come true. He is my only son. He is my only son as well. I'll burn lamps of my heart on the marriage procession. But how will the procession go? It is a matter of two countries. The marriage procession will go with.. Such grandeur that the world will watch in awe. My son will be drowned in flowers. He will be decorated in the sound of trumpets. He will move as if a moon has moved out of a group of stars. Greetings, mother. Come in, Amar. Mother, he has come to say something to you. Is that so? Come, sit down. Tell me, what is it? Mother, I want to marry Somna. I had written a letter to my home. They have sent a reply. My parents are very happy with this relation. I am very happy too. Really, you have rid me of a big difficulty. Tomorrow, I'll be going on a mountain. Until I return they would have come here. That is good. Then, I'll have all the preparations made. Ok, mother. I'll take your leave. Go and come back with success. At this time, you not only have your ambitions with you.. But you also have my well wishes. Today, I am sending you out. Tomorrow, I'll welcome you. Wish you good luck! - Good luck Amar! - Thank you, sir. Ok, friends. Come on, lets go. Look after youself. Somna, I'm going. But I am leaving my heartbeats with you as I go. But you are taking everything that I have. I don't even have my soul with me. It's only a matter of a few days. You are taking about days. For me every breath is heavy. I didn't know that this much pain is involved in love. [Crying] Somna! What is this? Are you so sad on me leaving? I won't go then. I'll go and tell the team to select some new leader. No! you must go Amar. I bind you to my word. These are tears of happiness. Your victory is shining in them. Tomorrow you will return will respect and admiration. People will sing your praises. You will be glorified everywhere. Smile then. A person who is about to go on a journey.. Is sent joyously by people. - Somna! - Amar! Save me! Help! Save me! Save me! Save me! [Laughing] Scream a lot. Make a lot of noise. This place is inside the earth. It is a chamber. Even the police haven't found out about it till today. You scoundrel! Ruffian! Thug! The debt for the first is pending. Now you are giving me another! [Groaning] Leave me! Let me go! When I light the lamps of roses you may leave. Leave me! [Yelling] Leave me! [Groaning] Leave her immediately otherwise I'll kill you! From the goods that were collected.. And witnesses born by Somna and Kailashnath.. It has been proved that the accused Shamsher Singh.. Is immoral as well as a smuggler. Hence, this court sentences Shamsher Singh.. To a rigorous imprisonment of 6 years. Life doesn't be over in 6 years, mister. Rajdhan, Sultan. Come out. Today is a very good day. Vijay, it looks like we will be successful today. Shobha, is the doctor here? Yes. He is here. Why? Aren't you well? Mother has a little fever. I have come to take some medicine for her. Greetings, doctor. Come, Rupa. When did you come from your in-laws place? I just came. Doctor, these days my heath seems to be improper. - You can't even have food? - Absolutely not. - Because you feel very excited. - Yes. Sometimes I even feel dizzy. And you wish to have something sour? - Yes, doctor. - You would want to. Silly girl, why did you come empty handed? You should have come with some sweets. You are pregnant. Yes, sir. The weather is very good. We are not very far away. I hope in 3 hours our flag will be on the peak. Very good. It's only due to you that Pavan giri mountaineering.. Club will be made famous. - Well done! - Thank you sir. Base camp. The advance party is going towards the summit. Its height may be about... Ok, roger. The base camp has reported that the advance party.. Has reached to about 24000 feet. - Good. - Yes. Mr. Kailash, when will the people who.. Have gone to the mountains return? Why? Are you getting worried? [Laughing] Tell me, principal. What do you think? When will they return? I cant tell you when they will return. But I can tell you where they are right now. Here! - Vijay, prepare a ladder. - Ok. O God! Send Amar back quickly. He doesn't know anything. My love shouldn't be proved wrong. My dignity, my life is all in your hands. In the avalanche our lost friends' names are... Vijay Kumar Mittal. Azeem Beg Sultan. Sohanlal Razdan. And Amar Kumar. - Mother! - Child! [Crying] Don't touch me, mother. My body is no more worthy to be touched. - I am pregnant! - Shobna! This is a sign of my destruction, mother. Now this flame will be nurtured and grow. In this fire of infamy it will sink with me. Why are you quiet? Curse me, give me insults! Spit on me! You may not be able to speak. You can hit me. Hit me! Tear away my body! Strangle me with these hands. So that my throat should not be blocked due to sin. You can't even do that. Alright.. Mr. Kailash! - Leave me! - Are you crazy? Along with your life do you want to end that little life too? [Sighs] That which is born out of a unmarried womb.. Gets a life full of thorns and its mother gets flames. I don't want such a life. I don't want it! Somna, you may get such a life which has.. Respect and dignity. Through which you may walk proudly. I'll marry you. No! On my body there are symbols of love. I won't let someone's shadow fall on my body. Somna, with me you will be as holy as a temple. You will only be provided with the protection of a husband's name. With this cover, your body will be hidden and.. The child's head will also be covered. Somna, 7 years ago I had died in a way. Perhaps, to give you support I have got rebirth in this form. Hey! He is alive! [Chant] It's a case of coma. When do you think will he be conscious? Nothing can be said. Will he be saved? We can expect that. I have been dreaming from such a long time. And in that home - there will be a garden. And in that garden there will be colourful flowers. And among those flowers another flower will grow. Somna. I was reading a book. Munshi Premchand's Seva Sadan. I kept it somewhere here. I can't find it. - Will you find it please? - Alright. - Here it is. - Was it here? Oh! Thank you. But by finding Seva Sadan serving a husband is not over. The first job is to serve tea to your husband.. When he comes from outside. And the biggest thing is to welcome him with a smile. Won't you smile? Smile, I have come from outside. Smile! A letter. A letter? Whose is it? Somna Devi, care of Kailash Kaushal. It is ours. From where is it? Who has sent it? Read it to me please. It has come from Swarnmeru hospital. It is written, 'your prayers have saved me.' 'I will return when I am well.' Amar. Amar is alive? I will get my lost son again. I am so lucky, I never even dreamt of it. Congratulations, Amar. The X-ray report is completely ok. Does this mean I will be discharged.. ..out of the hospital? Of course. Yu may leave. Thank you, doctor. Doctor, I can't thank you enough. Along with our son's life you have also saved our life. It is god's grace. Before you go, come and meet me. I'll give you some instructions. Thank you, doctor. Mother, why not go to Pavangili today? That is absolutely right. - What do you say? - That is right. But first think what is to be done on reaching there. I have thought about all that. Engagement and wedding should be done together. Now I will go home only when I have my.. Daughter-in-law with me. Aunt Leela! You! Somna has come too, right? Aunt Leela, hasn't Somna come? If you would have brought her together I would.. Have been able to have a look at my daughter-in-law. Now we are going there. You can look at her with contentment. Aunt Leela why are you quiet? Is Somna well? Why don't you say something? What is it? Why didn't Somna come? Aunt Leela, your silence may kill me! - For God's sake, tell me. - Where is Somna? How is she? Somna has died. She couldn't bear news about your death. Somna! Somna! Somna! East African Airways announces departure of.. Their Super VC10 to Karachi, Aden Nairobi.. And Dar E Salaam. Passengers travelling on this flight are.. Expected to proceed to the aircraft. Congratulations, you have a son! Thank you doctor. How is Somna? She is well? - May I go in? - After 5 minutes. Get the boy here. Amar. Whenever I look at you, you are sitting alone and sad. Until when will you run away from life? Welcome new expectations. If not for yourself then for us. You will blossom and glow. We will be blessed. Father, leave me to my state. How can I leave you, son? If you would be a father you would realize.. What a son's pain is. [Baby Crying] No! Don't cry! He is crying a lot today. Give him to me. Good children don't cry! And you are a very good child. "Should I call you the sun or the moon?" "Should I call you a lamp or a star?" "You will make my name prosperous." "In this world, my dearest son." "Should I call you the sun or the moon?" "Should I call you a lamp or a star?" "You will make my name prosperous." "In this world, my dearest son." "I was craving since a long time." "Someone should play in my house." "In return for a little laughter." "He should take my whole world." "With you the whole world is moving in my arms. "You will make my name prosperous." "In this world, my dearest son." "Should I call you the sun or the moon?" "Should I call you a lamp or a star?" "You will make my name prosperous." "In this world, my dearest son." "Holding your fingers today." "I will teach you to walk." "Tomorrow hold my hands." "When I would be old." "On getting you I found a new support to live." "You will make my name prosperous." "In this world, my dearest son." "Should I call you the sun or the moon?" "Should I call you a lamp or a star?" "You will make my name prosperous." "In this world, my dearest son." - Greetings, sister-in-law. - Greetings, doctor. Doctor, his health isn't very well. Check him well. Why? What has happened to me? He cant sleep well and he doesn't get hungry at all. I eat a lot and sleep for a long time. But doctor, Bobby doesn't feel hungry. He neither eats well nor does he drink milk. Check him. Bobby! He is always worried about Bobby. He doesn't care about himself at all. Here, doctor. Check him properly. Whatever complaints he has, you can assume.. That they are mine. Treat him well, I will be alright. The boy is completely well. You are misunderstood. Mummy, I'm hungry. Give me milk. Look at that. He is asking for milk and you said that he.. Doesn't get hungry. Look at how much milk he drinks. Not even two drops. Doctor, don't listen to what he says. Treat him well. He always avoids it. Did you hear that? Orders from high command. [Breathing Heavily] Breathe. [Cough] It appears that you haven't stopped smoking cigars. Cigars? It has been quite a while since I left it. You have left it but it isn't leaving you. I know very well that you haven't stopped.. Smoking a cigar for even a day. Friend, you are simply doubting me. I have even forgotten its name. The same lie again? It is better if you admit to your crime before it is proved. - Otherwise you will repent. - Doctor, listen to me. Look, the tea is getting cold. Where are you going? You really stopped smoking? How did this miracle take place? This miracle has taken place due to Bobby, doctor. He has filled this dark house will brightness. Now I want to live. [Short Laugh] [Distant Song Singing] It is the same beggar. He has come after a long time. "People with children, may you prosper." "People with children, may you prosper." "Give us money." "You won't lose anything by this, rich people." "Take prayers from the poor." "Your riches will increase, rich people." "Only he has received in this world who has given." "People with children, may you prosper." "People with children, may you prosper." Sir, forgive me. I made a mistake. I won't sing anymore. [Chuckling] Why not? You will surely sing. You will sing everyday. Your prayers have been heard by this house. Sing! [Harmonium] "May your son live for a long time." "May he always you're your name prosperous." "The world will always give praise." "He will do such deeds." "In return for good, you have been blessed." "People with children, may you prosper." "People with children, may you prosper." Take this. Sir, your horse has come. Right at 4.15. Papa, you always come on time. Look, horse. Today make 4 rounds. Sir, I will do as you order. Come on my horse, move on. Come on my horse, move on. Come on my horse, move on. Come on my horse, move on. Bobby, you are sitting on daddy again. Mummy, I'm sitting on my horse. Why, my horse? Isn't that right? Yes, sir. That is absolutely right. It isn't right. Come on. Get off straight away. Otherwise I won't give you any toffee or chocolate. Tell her, that you will take it from daddy. I'll take it from daddy. You have pampered him a lot. I won't even talk to you. Don't talk to me. I'll talk to Bobby. Why? Isn't that right, son? Absolutely right, daddy. I won't talk to mummy. Yes. Now that is something. Come on, son. Lets go. People are jealous to look at us. - Come on. - Come on my horse, move on. Come on my horse, move on. Amar. Son, have this juice. Mother, there is a letter from Kilimanjaro.. Mountaineering club. They want to make me their team leader.. And take me to Pavangiri. That's it. Whenever you get a small chance.. You get excited to go to Pavangiri. I won't let you go. Let me go there once, mother. I won't go there ever again. I won't even speak about going there. Did you hear that? He is adamant on going there again. He would certainly allow me to go there. He won't listen to you. He is more strict than I am. If you talk about going there again.. We won't even let you go outside our house. I am not one of those people who keep others tied. Amar, you have full permission from me. You can certainly go. Thank you, father. Thank you very much. What have you done? Now he has only that cure. Are you knowing pushing him into the face of death? I am sending him to bring life. Let him go there. Let him cry as much as he wants to. In that storm of tears, the previous age will flow by. What are you writing, son? Bobby, son of Kailashnath. Bobby, son of Kailashnath. "After me in the world, my name will live on." "Whoever looks at you." "He will call you as my son." "Through you I will get my life again." "You will make my name prosperous." "In this world, my dearest son." Sir, you have a letter. Young sir, come on. Your milk is getting cold. Whose letter is it? From where has it come? It from Delhi. I will have to go there for some days. Daddy. I will accompany you to Delhi. You can go, sir. But first drink your milk. There is a problem. I can't take Bobby with me and he will harass you here. Don't worry. I will be here till you return. We will take care of Bobby. Thank you, aunt Leela. Out! Come on, give me the ball. I won't give it. Why won't you? The ball is ours. But it has come to me. So what? Does anything that come to you become yours? [Laughing] You are very smart. What is your name? - Bobby. - You have a very sweet name. - Whose son are you? - I am my daddy son. Very good! You have a very sweet way of talking. That is because I eat a lot of chocolate. - Who are you? - Me? I'm uncle. From today, you and I are friends. Bobby! Bobby, your turn has come. I don't want to play. Why don't you want to play? Uncle, these kids beat me. Really? What if I were to train you? - Will you train me? - Yes. I'll teach you so well that you will defeat all children. I'll make you a hero. A hero? Like the ones in movies? Even a better one than that. From tomorrow, come here at 4.30. - Ok? - Ok. Bobby, it is evening. Let's go home. Come on, come. Bye! I have hopes that the work will be completed soon. Yes, Somna. Where is Bobby? Call him over. He has gone to play. He must be coming around. - Mummy! - There, he has come. Bobby, your daddy has made a trunk call. Trunk call! - Hello Daddy. - Hello Bobby. What's going on? What are you doing? I'm talking to you. [Laughing] Bobby, you don't trouble mummy, do you? No daddy. I don't trouble mummy at all. Ask him when he is coming. Daddy, when are you coming? I am coming very soon. Don't worry at all. I am not worried, daddy. I am very happy today. Today I met an uncle. Uncle? Who is this uncle? Where did you meet him? On the playground? Yes. He'll teach me cricket and make me a hero. Oh! A hero! Very good! Well, introduce me to your uncle as well. I surely will. You will be happy to meet him. I will be pleased. Why wouldn't I be happy? - Time over please. - Alright. Ok, Bobby. The time's over. - Bye-bye! - Bye-Bye, daddy. Well, who is this uncle you found? I found a very good uncle, mummy. Really? What is your uncle's name? His name? I don't know his name. I'll tell him tomorrow that mummy was.. Asking for your name. Then I'll tell you. No-no. Don't ask him anything. Out! [Laughing] Wow, Bobby! You have become a champion only in 2 days. So, from today, you are Bobby and I'm uncle. Ok, uncle. Oh! My car has come. Mummy has come too. - Mummy! - Come on, Bobby. Lets go home. No, mummy. My turn is about to come. I'll play and then leave. Come, I'll introduce you to uncle. - Bobby. - I'm coming. Uncle, meet my mother. Bobby. - Amar! - Somna! You are alive! Mother, why did you lie? Why did you go to Amar and tell him that I have died? And why did you hide this from me that Amar is alive? I have no fault in this, child. I got Amar's letter at that time when you were married. Then you should have told him that much. Why didn't you explain it all to him? In my this lie, I only wished to do good, child. I thought it would be right for you to lose.. Love from your hearts forever. Only then would you be able to accept a new life. We can't end a person who is living, child. A person who has died goes away. Who is it that hasn't accepted defeat before fate? [Thunder] Amar! Where are you going? - On a mountain. - In this storm? - Move out of my way! - Amar! Why are you going to face death? Death? Where is death not present? Death is present everywhere. It is at every step. - Move out of my way! - Have you gone mad? Yes, I am mad. I want to die. I don't want to live. I want death! I want death! Mummy. Mummy. - Mummy! - Yes, son? What are you thinking, mummy? - Nothing, son. - Bobby! - Daddy! - Hi! [Laughing] Daddy, you have come. Tell me, Somna. Are you well? Yes, I am well. How were you in Delhi? First class. Greetings, aunt Leela. Greetings. It is good that you have come. Daddy, what have you brought for me? For you? Come along, I'll show you. SS Vikon. Its great, daddy. You are great too, Bobby. Did you get a bat and a ball, daddy? Bat-ball? I didn't get a bat-ball. You should have brought them. With a new bat-ball uncle could have taught me better. Uncle? He who is going to make you a hero? Yes, daddy. Yesterday I introduced mummy to uncle. Why, Somna? Who is this uncle? Do you know him? He is a very good uncle, daddy. I like him a lot. Wow! This uncle turned to be a very good magician. In just 2 days he played magic on my son. What do you say, Somna? He'll play magic on you too. Isn't it so, mummy? He is such a talkative kid. He has just come tired from his journey. At least let him breathe properly. No matter how tired I feel, on meeting Bobby I feel fresh! Daddy, I'll introduce you to uncle tomorrow itself. Yesterday! Do you know what's tomorrow? All of you have forgotten about it. I haven't forgotten. That is why I left all my work and came here from Delhi. My Bobby has his birthday. [Laughing] [Clarinet] [Band] Hello, welcome! - Uncle. - Yes? Where is Bobby? We are all waiting for him. - Isn't Bobby present with you? - No. Somna. Send Bobby, all the kids are waiting for him. - Where is he? - Bobby? He should be around. Ketki, call Bobby. Look where he is. Bobby. Bobby! Uncle, I have come to take you. Its my birthday today. Birthday? Happy birthday, Bobby. Not here. Come to my home. To your home? I'll come some other day. Why some other day? I have my birthday today. Bobby, you don't understand. It is very difficult for me to come. It is very easy uncle. I live nearby. But Bobby, I can't come. You can't come? Don't come then. I won't go home too. Mummy-daddy will be worried. Let them be. The whole house can't take care of a kid? This is strange. He may go anywhere, at any place. No one cares about it. - Daddy. - Oh! Oh Bobby! Where had you gone to? Daddy, I had gone to bring uncle. There he is. Come in, uncle. Meet my daddy. Daddy, uncle. Bobby, come here! Amar. Don't look at me with surprise. It was in my fate to meet you again. Congratulations on your son's birthday. Forgive me, I am an uninvited guest. No! You are the real guest. You are Bobby's special uncle. - Come sit. - Uncle. Not there. Here. Aunties, uncles and friends. Now my good uncle will sing a very good song.. On the occasion of my birthday. Come on, uncle. Bobby, what is this? Uncle, now the announcement has been made. Now you will have to sing. What do you say, daddy? Isn't it right? Yes, absolutely. He is such a smart boy. I truly tell you, sister-in-law. He doesn't have any reflection of this stupid father. [Laughing] Hey! Uncle has come to sing a song. And you people are not applauding him. Mummy, daddy. Clap your hands. Doctor uncle, you should clap too. Come on, uncle. Come on! Well, clap on. Clap your hands. [Applause] All children clap your hands. [Piano] "Oh young angel." "What relation do I have with you?" "What kind of relations are these, made by the heart?" "Oh young angel." "What relation do I have with you?" "What kind of relations are these, made by the heart?" "Oh young angel." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Why do eyes desire to look at you every time?" "Why do eyes desire to look at you every time?" "These arms are impatient for you." "I don't know myself, why I love you." "Oh young angel." "What relation do I have with you?" "What kind of relations are these, made by the heart?" "Oh young angel." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "You are a delicate flower." "You belong to someone else." "You are a delicate flower." "You belong to someone else." "Why does the garden of my mind have your scent?" "Why has beauty spread in my life due to you?" "Oh young angel." "What relation do I have with you?" "What kind of relations are these, made by the heart?" "Oh young angel." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "You are not related to me." "Yet why are you endeared to me?" "On looking at you, why do waves rise in me?" "Why do I always wait for you?" "Oh young angel." "What relation do I have with you?" "What kind of relations are these, made by the heart?" "Oh young angel." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." [Applause] [Thunder] [wind] The air is very strong. It appears that a storm is coming. There won't be any storm. It is climatic wind. It will pass on its own. That is what think too. [Breathing Heavily] Shobha darling, you are not a flower of scents but a tree. That's it. You only know to sing praises. And I don't know to give you child. What else? Look at Mr. Kailash. He got married at an old age. In a year he had a son. And you? It has been 6 years. You still haven't borne even one son. Don't ensnare my senses, Shobha. I can bear a whole cricket team. But my father had said this when he died. Son, be in a hurry to get married... And don't make a hurry to bear a child. Will I forever be childless? Absolutely not! My father had also said this when he died. Son, if it comes down to your don't worry about my sayings. 1, 2, 3! [Cats - Mew] You are our cat and are disturbing us? Are you hurt? [Alarms Wailing] Shobha, our time appears to be bad today. But I won't lose courage today. Oh ho! I had told you that we shouldn't suddenly.. Enter someone's bedroom like this. It doesn't belong to someone else. Its my daughter's bedroom. What is the need to hide something from a mother? Your brains have gone behind some veil. - Remove this viel. - Give him the good news. I am your mother-in-law, not a stranger. Son, Bahadur. Make preparations to leave. Just look at your son's face. What? I have had a son and I don't know? You don't have a son, you will. But you will have to take some trouble. Trouble? For fulfilling this desire of mine.. - I can even confront a mountain. - Oh ho! There is no need to face a mountain. You have to climb it. [Chuckling] A hermit who gives blessings for a child.. Has scaled the height of mount Chinchinachu.. To be conquered. The peak of Chinchinachu mountain? Can't that sage come down from the peak.. Of Chinchinachu mountain? Absolutely not! A well doesn't got to a thirsty person. Then take Shobha. She is the one who will have a child. That sage doesn't look at a woman's face. That is why you will have to go. Come on. "Come on, young man." "Come on, young man." "Living is not your work." "Dying is your pride." "Come on, young man." "Climb the mountain." "Die without meeting death." "You will die but you will be famous." "Come on, young man." "Come on, young man." "How do I go ahead?" "Mother-in-law, how do I go ahead?" "The mountain is high." "There are deep valleys beneath." "I am afraid." "How do I go ahead?" "Mother-in-law, how do I go ahead?" "The promise that you have made, you will have to fulfil." "Whether you crack your head or break your leg." "You will have to go." "The promise that you have made, you will have to fulfil." "You will have to fulfil it." "Listening to your mother's saying." "Why are you happy to give me trouble?" "One day you will be sad." "When you will see my corpse." "Oh young boy why are you giving excuses?" "No one knows about your works." "But I am your mother-in-law." "I know that you are impish." "Throughout my life, I won't leave your daughter's hand." "If mother-in-law, you leave this deal of this mountain." "If mother-in-law, you leave this deal of this mountain." "Now don't make a delay, my son." "The Himalaya is waiting for you." "Now don't make a delay, my son." "The Himalaya is waiting for you." "You will have to take punches and slaps." "If you make a further delay." "Now don't make a delay, my son." "The Himalaya is waiting for you." "Allah, I call out to you." "Such a coward this son-in-law is." "My mother-in-law is a fat butcher." "My wife is liar by her heart." "My mother-in-law is a fat butcher." "My wife is liar by her heart." "Today, it has become a matter of my life." "Allah, I call out to you." "If you are a true husband." "Go, go, go." "You are a man." "Why do you speak unmanly?" "You are a man." "Why do you speak unmanly?" "My love, on your window there is a lovely touch." "My love, on your window there is a lovely touch." "But I regret, your mummy has a bloated mouth." "She has a bloated mouth." "Let the shoe be as it is." "Don't pick up your shoe." "Let the shoe be as it is." "Don't pick up your shoe." "If the shoe is raised he will also be..." "Bald like me, bald like me." "Bald like me, bald like me." "I am leaving, I am leaving." "With a band on my head." "On the path of death." "Goodbye, my darling." "I am leaving, I am leaving." "These are roads of mountains." "Climb on them by making jumps." "These are roads of mountains." "Climb on them by making jumps." "Life won't be seen, if I fall a little by slipping." "These are roads of mountains." "Climb on them by making jumps." Amar, your watch may be wrong. Bobby can't be late. He will come at the correct time. I look at him and match my watch. Yes, Bahadur. He truly likes me a lot. He doesn't just like you, Even if there is a storm or a tornado. He crashes through it and comes to meet you. [Chuckling] May I ask you something? Is it that Bobby is your son? What are you saying? Forgive me, dear. My father told me this when he died. Son... well, let it be. My father had said a lot when he died. Come on my horse, move on. Come on my horse, move on. Come on my horse, move on. Wait, horse. Why are you getting off? It has been only 2 rounds now. 4 rounds are remaining. - Complete them tomorrow. - Why tomorrow? It is time to go to uncle. Greetings, grandmother. Bobby, where are you running to? I am going to my uncle, grandmother. To your uncle? Look what I have brought for you. A sweet dish made of apples. You like it, don't you? Come on, eat it. I'll eat it later, grandmother. Now its time to go to uncle. Bye. Come on. Child, you have given too much leeway to Bobby. He has started playing a lot. Make him sit for studying. And don't let him go out of this house. You are right, mother. Did you hear? Mother says we should pay attention to Bobby. And I say the same thing. Send him to Gwalior. I have heard that there is a very good school.. There for children. That would be right. There, he will study a lot. His attention will not wander around. We are losing control over him here. We are losing him? No! Bobby will stay here. He will study here, before my eyes. I have full confidence. Daddy, are all these for me? That's true, son. It is all for you. Daddy, you are so good. You have brought so many toys for me. Daddy, look how the helicopter moves. [Laughing] And look at this, Boeing 72. Daddy, look at this. - The refrigerator drinks coffee. - How? Yes! That is right. And look. A Cadillac. Motor car. Motor? One minute, daddy. Daddy, take a look at this motor too. Uncle has given it to me. Isn't it good, daddy? It is very good, son. The only difference is that this one.. Is very big and this one is small. What if it is small? It is quite fast in speed. This one is more faster than that, Bobby. Its speed is a record. Lets have a race and check that. A race should be between equals. It should not be between disproportionate things. You will lose. You will lose. That is why you are scared. We'll know right now who is faster. Come on. Whatever you say, sir. Let's go. [Wall Clock] Where are you going Bobby? All these toys are just lying by. And you didn't even have a look at this magical soldier. [Toy Noise] Keep it, daddy. I'll look at it later. Now I don't have time. Uncle must be waiting for me. No one waits for anybody. Today, I will teach my son. You can't teach me better than uncle can. You don't need to go to uncle. No, I want to go! I'll see how you go! Come here! You don't even listen to anyone. You just do as you wish. You have turned very adamant. Sit here. Don't dare to get up from here. I'll break your legs. [Baby Crying] What happened? Why is Bobby crying? Daddy, mummy won't let me go to uncle. Let me go! Let me go! Somna, let Bobby go. - Go on, son. - Thank you, daddy. Thank you. You are smoking a Cigar again? You had left smoking it. I had cheated myself. Now it appears that habits and fate doesn't stop pursuit. You won't smoke a cigar. I'll get Bobby back right now. Wait Somna. You think I am sad about Bobby going away. And that is why I am smoking a cigar? You are wrong. I am not sad about that. Children do have tantrums. Then again, Bobby's going doesn't mean that he has left. He has only gone to play. He will come back home in a while. You are simply getting worried. Bobby doesn't like anyone. He loves me the most. You don't know how thirsty he is for my love. Without me he doesn't feel good. Don't I know this? Whenever I go out somewhere.. He keeps talking about me. He doesn't even forget me for a moment. The impatience that I have in my heart.. He has much more than that for me. You know all this, you understand. Still you are getting worried. Look at me. There is no worry on my face. There is no impatience in my mind. There is only peace. There is only happiness. There is complete calm. [Applause] Wow! I have come to say something to you. Uncle, don't talk to mummy. Mummy is very bad. Why? When I was coming here, mummy stopped me. She says, don't go to uncle. - Bobby! - She caught my ears and hit me. And she says that if I would go to uncle.. She would break my legs. Do you hate me so much? Do you want to keep your son away from even my shadow? I thought until today that fate has cheated us. But today I have realized. You are playing with my life. You used my accident and fulfilled all your dreams. Even if a neighbour dies, people.. Mourn over him for months. I was your own. Couldn't you stay without me for 2 months? Why did you hurry to get married? Look at me, my love increased in time. Today I like this child, because he is yours. I used to get a little peace by looking at him. He was all that I had. You even want to take that away. You are giving me a favourable.. ..reply to my faithfulness. Uncle. [River Waves] - Daddy, look at that. - Yes. Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! - Bobby! - Uncle! Uncle! [Whistling] Move away! Get away! It's a dynamite deposit! There is a cover being laid. [Whistling Continues] Move away. Bobby! [Explosion] Bobby! Bobby! Where is Bobby? How is he? He has lost a lot of blood. More blood will have to be given. His father's blood is being tested. I'm sorry, Kailash. Your blood doesn't match with Bobby. Yes! Sometimes relatives don't have.. ..a matching blood group. Doctor, try my blood. It is possible that a outsider's blood may match. Yes, come along. Amar, your blood makes a match. Amar, your blood makes a match. He is such a smart boy. I truly tell you, sister-in-law. He doesn't have any reflection of this stupid father. May I ask you something? Is it that Bobby is your son? What are you saying?' [Rainfall] [Screaming] [Thunder] Bobby! Wait! Where are you taking Bobby? I will take him wherever I want to. Who are you to take him away? Who are you to ask me? Me? I'm his father. Bobby is my son. You are cheating yourself. You are not his father. Go and ask the whole world who is Bobby's father. Bobby is my son. The world doesn't know it, you do. No-no! This is wrong. This is a lie! This is the truth. You are a fake father. I am related to him by blood. No one can stop this flow. Don't take him. He is my lamp. But his flame is mine. I have very little to live. And I have my whole life to be spent. - Amar! - Move away! You have no right over him. Alright, I won't use my right. Bobby is your son. But I have nurtured him. With my blood I have grown this plant. In his heart, my heart beats. Don't take my soul away from my body. I can't leave him. I fall at your feet. Have mercy! For God's sake, give him to me. I am living for him. In my desolate world, he is the only sign of life. Don't remove it. I will be lost. Leave my feet. Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! I have to meet Somna Devi immediately. But she has gone to the hospital. Hospital? You must have seen a bad nightmare.. Which made you sweat. Its alright. Drink some juice. You will be ok. Bobby! Bobby, my son. My child! Nurse, how is Bobby's health? Now he is completely alright. He is only asleep. Somna. I was looking for you. Whose son is Bobby? Is he mine or is he Kailash's son? I bind you to Bobby's name, Somna. Your hand is on his head. Tell me. Tell me, isn't he my son? Now I don't have any doubt. I am certain that Bobby is my son. And as he is my son, I can't stay separated from him. I'll take him away. No! You can't take Bobby away. Bobby is not your son. He is not even mine. Bobby is Kailash's son. It is due to him that he is alive today. If we wouldn't have received his protection.. Even his sign would not be found today. He didn't accept my beauty by my ugliness. He put vermillion on my impure head.. And raised my lowered head. Amar, he didn't just give shelter to Booby. He also gave him love. He gave him his day and night. He even squeezed his soul and put it into his body. Today's Bobby's form is in his image. He is walking with Bobby's feet. He is looking with his eyes. Will you snatch these eyes? Will you ask for your right and push him into darkness? For God's sake, don't do this. Forget Bobby. His breath is connected with Bobby. If that is broken, his life's line will be broken. I beg before you for the life of that great man. Stop it, Somna. Don't say anything else. Bobby belongs to Mr. Kailash and he will remain his. I will go away from his world. Far away. Somna, your happiness lies in mine, doesn't it? My happiness lies in Bobby being happy. I understand his feelings. Somna, the purpose for which God had united you with me.. The time has come to complete it. I am not of importance. I am a caretaker. I am not a owner. I am the way, not the goal. Somna, all that happiness that once time stole from you.. I want to gather them again and put them into your arms. For God's sake be quiet! I don't want to listen to all this. Don't talk to me like that. - Are you people ready to go? - Yes. The weather report is ok. I have also told Amar about it. Bobby! Bobby, my child. My son. Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby! What has happened to you? Its nothing, son. Nothing. Sir. Sir, I'll take the luggage. Are you going somewhere, uncle? Yes, Bobby. I am going very far away. Are you leaving me? Companionship is not given up, son. - It is lost. - Take me with you. How can I take you with me, Bobby? Why can't you take me? You have your mother here. You have your daddy here. I am a stranger, an outsider. I am a person you know only for a few days. You will forget me. I won't forget you. I will never forget you. I won't leave you. I will go with you. No, son. You can't come with me. Mr. Kailash, here is your son. Goodbye uncle. Goodbye Bobby. "He who sacrifices all the happiness.. Of his heart is blessed." "He who would give the lamp of his house." "So that he can brighten someone's world." "He isn't a man but an angel." "He isn't a man but an angel." "People with children, may you prosper." "People with children, may you prosper." What happened? Bobby has been abducted by Shamsher Singh! [Laughing] Now I'll get 5 lakh rupees as well as your mother. Let me go! Let me go! I will let you go. First let me get my revenge. Move aside! [Door Closes] Open it! Open! Let me go to mummy. Let me go to daddy. Open it! Open! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle... uncle... Uncle! Uncle! [Laughing] Don't dare to move! Leave the boy immediately, otherwise I'll shoot you! Throw away the gun, right now. - Daddy! - Throw it. Beware! Fight him, daddy. [Screaming] Leave me! Help me! [Groaning] Help me! Help me! Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen! Say something. - Where is Bobby? - Bobby. Bobby! - Bobby! - Mummy! Bobby! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Bobby! My son, my child! - Bobby! - Mummy! Daddy! What happened to you? Listen! Listen! Open your eyes. - Mr. Kailash! - Look your Bobby has come. Talk to your Bobby. Daddy, daddy. I'm your son, Bobby. Talk to me, daddy. Daddy. [Sobbing] - I will fetch a doctor. - No! Now, I have.. Little time remaining. Here. Your son, be with him. Take care of Bobby. Somna, don't let your faith and marriage be lost. - No! - Mr. Kailash. [Sobbing] Daddy, daddy. Daddy, daddy. Daddy! [School Bells] What is the boy's name? - Bobby. - Bobby. What is the child's father's name? Amar. No. Late Kailashnath. "After me in the world, my name will live on." "Whoever looks at you." "He will call you as my son." "Through you I will get my life again." "You will make my name prosperous." "In this world, my dearest son."
