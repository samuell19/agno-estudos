DOOR SLAMS That was all a bit fucking surreal. What do you mean? I can't believe you just sold crack to Miss Marple and struck a deal with Blazin' Squad. How old is she? About 60? Mate, she's been doing drugs longer than we've been alive, yeah? Do you reckon? When did you start knocking out? What? Crack. About three and a half, four years ago. When did you stop knocking out pills? When do you think? Do you get involved? - No. Have you? - No, fuck that! Do you want to buy some? Yeah, only if I get a fucking discount!

Did you tell Rachel? - What? - About me. No, no, I didn't. Mate, I thought it'd be a surprise. Mate, it'll be fine. Who else is going to be there? I don't know. A lot of her new mates. I don't know many of them. - What's the plan? Are we going to go and see your mum and dad first? - No. You should go, mate, see what they've got to say. I thought you worked in recruitment. - What? - When did you become a family fucking liaison? What are you talking about, you nutter? I was just saying! Look, mate, I'm going to be stuck in some fucking warehouse, looking after 20 Bengalis, knocking out dodgy Fruit of the Looms. I know exactly who they want me to meet. It might not be. It might be some sweet little earner in the city. - I've got a sweet little earner here. - But you won't be sweating bullets every time the doorbell goes. You ain't knocking out weed any more. This ain't college. You know what I mean? You're in deep, bruv. - That shit will put you down for life. - Only if you get caught. Oi, Malik! Fucking hell, Shifty! Are you all right, bruv? I didn't even clock you. - What's going on? - Long story, geezer. All right, mate? - All right? - This is Chris, an old mate of mine. - Someone's got to be! - Where are you going? Where are you running? - Do you remember I was telling you about my pal Craig? - No. - The geezer who's seeing Desmond Dodge's sister. - Yeah, small Craig. Remember I told you he had the job at the fucking storage warehouse? - Yeah, go on. - Craig tells me every Friday on the fucking dot, a delivery is made of this top electrical gear. Cheers, mate. So, every Friday, they make this fucking drop-off, but because the lorries can't reverse into the courtyard, something to do with the angle of the fucking gates, they leave all these crates sitting on the fucking road! - Are you on their way now? - I drummed the place ten minutes ago, blood! No, no. The forklift went inside with the first batch, so I nipped in, started whacking in the gear. - Turns out they've another fucking forklift! - What are you running for? They caught me in the middle of loading up. I'll do you a right good deal. I'll sort you right out, proper. SIREN WAILS Back, back, back! Back! Why the fuck am I running? Fuck it! What's the matter? What's the matter? Mate, I'm telling you... This is no way to live. Oh, fuck! Man, I'm serious. You need to get away from this shit. Come and live with me for a bit. I'm serious, mate. You'd love Manchester. It's full of fitness. Mate, I can't just fuck off, yeah? Yeah, you can. Yeah, but I wouldn't though, would I, mate? Besides, I don't want to. I'm perfectly happy where I am. If Manchester's so full of gal, how come you ain't got a bird yet? I've been on enough dates. Some of them are fucking lovely. I just haven't been able to get my head around it ever since Serena. Mate, that was four years ago. Did you go to the funeral? Yeah, of course I did, man. Did anybody say anything? About what? - About me. - Yeah. - A lot of people were saying a lot of shit about both of us. - Like what? - Just rumours, mate. You know what I mean? Just fucking bullshit. What did people say when I left? Mate, I don't know, but whatever people are saying about you, they're saying about me. Fuck this! I'm going to get fucking lick-shot tonight! Yeah, you know it. Fucking back to mine, bit of munch, couple of Paul Wellers. Yeah, let's get a bottle of whisky. - Fuck that! - Why not? - Because you always kick off. - I don't. - Last time you had a bottle of whisky, you pissed on my leg. - Bollocks! - In a nightclub. - Fuck off! - In front of a bouncer. - Oh, yeah, I remember. - You crackhead! Look, I've got one more drop-off to do, then we can chill out, yeah? Sweet. 'Magnus? It's Glen, mate.' No, I'm good. How are you? I put the word out about that thing. I've got a pretty good idea about what's going on. Yeah. It's Shifty, mate. I know. Little f... Yeah, definitely. Definitely. To be honest, I could have told you that in the first place. I'm not fucking cutting the gear up, mate, and Lenny's not cutting it up. Look at the fucking state of him. Yeah. I-I know. I mean... They're all on the make. He's a Paki. He'd sell his sister for a set of rims. No, I spoke with him. I told him what I'd heard and he told me to go fuck myself, the little prick. He wants to speak to you himself. I know. Look, mate, he's getting out of hand, Magnus. Something has to be done. No! NO! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Aargh! Fuck! Aargh! Fucking...! Argh! 'Ken? It's Trevor.' Yeah, I'm all right, mate.

You don't have to come if you don't want. It's up to you. Yeah, cool. I'll probably just grab my stuff from yours, then. As if I'm not going to come with you, you nutter. - I thought you was gonna leave me stone cold, man. - You're used to it. There's only so much a man can take. Oh, now you start throwing punches?

He said you lost all his gear, lost him a load of money. Mate, he went mental. He started saying all this shit about me cutting up the coke, mixing it up. All this bullshit. Where would he be getting that from? Who's talking shit? Dunno. Your guess is as good as mine. Well, listen, man. Do me a favour. Give him a bell in front of me and tell him I ain't cutting the gear. - You call him yourself. - Tell him. - I don't know what you do, Shifty! All I know is you bowl around town with your smooth fucking patter. - What? - Mugging off Magnus. Laughing behind his back? - What the fuck are you talking about? And then you come to my house and you threaten me, shooting your mouth off about what you'll do to Magnus. Mate, you've been cutting up the gear all along, sending half to the Walshes, cutting Magnus out. - Who told you that? - Fuck you! - Fuck you! You're just jealous because you didn't think of it before me. - I didn't think of it first because I'm not that fucking stupid. - KNOCK AT DOOR Mate, can we go? - Yeah, don't worry about it, man. I'm leaving. - About time you two fucked off. - Fuck off, Glen! After what happened. No wonder you left, mate. What did you say? - Well, you couldn't exactly show your face round here, could you? After what you done. - Mate, leave it! Hang on a minute. - What did I do exactly? - Get him the fuck out of my house. - What the fuck did I do? - Mate, just leave it. - What did I fucking do? What are you gonna do? You gonna give it some, are you? Go on, tell me. Tell me, please. What did I fucking do? Or what? You gonna kill me? Like you did Serena. You're already fucking dead! You're fucked! You're fucked! - Where are we going? - Back to mine. - Hold on a minute. Just listen to me. We should just go. Get the fuck out. Leave. Go to Manchester tonight. I'm telling you. Chris, I can't. I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving my brother. Does everybody think it was me? If they did, you'd be in prison, mate. Running off didn't help. I can't even remember giving it to her. We were all pretty fucked. She told me she'd done pills before. Mate, look, if she hadn't got them off you, she would have got them off someone else. Yeah, but she didn't, though, did she? Jesus Christ, man! What are you fucking doing?! - Man, a fucking gun! This is bullshit! - Sit down! Have you got a better idea? Sit the fuck down. I'm glad you're fucking sorted. Wish I'd slept last night. I'm fucked. Got any coke? I'm all out. We got chased by the police today. Got mugged. My brother flushed all my gear down the toilet. Ssh! The party was sick, though, wasn't it? Fuck the party. I never wanted to go to it anyway. BOTH LAUGH Oh! What's the matter? What's happened? Give me your phone. Give me your phone. Let's go. Fuck you! You're just jealous cos you didn't think of it before me. You're not as fucking smart as me. Do me a favour, babe. CRASHING Down! Down! You piece of shit!
