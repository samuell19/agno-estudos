With my sword held high, we'll climb to the sky! Again already? Forward! And away! Hop to it! All right. Like that, do it right, I have to... And whoops-a-daisy! Oh my, what a beautiful falcon! What is that before my eyes? On the cliff a phantom flies! OK! Perfect. I'm afraid Curie won't find us here. We'll surely freeze here. If yourfaith doesn't fail, we'll surely prevail! Over the mountain we must be strong find the Head and right this wrong. All right Schubert, keep going, almost there, almost there. Just a little farther... You think this room is clean?
