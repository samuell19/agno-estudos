Your attention, please. In this precise moment I will pour into the test tube some sodium hydroxide, dissolved in water. As you know, it makes hydroxyl. I have, in practice, prepared a base. Now we'll take one sheet of litmus paper. It is a substance gotten from lichens. This paper has the characteristic of remaining blue, if introduced in an alkaline environment. Instead, it turns red, if introduced in an acid environment. Now we ask ourselves... What happens to this litmus paper if I slip it into the test tube? It will become blue because the sodium hydroxide is alkaline. Very good! Be seated. Teacher! Can a women become pregnant with a test tube? Don't be silly, Zampanò. One of my girlfriends did a test with some guys and she got pregnant. Stop it. Everyone sit down! Are you being funny? We'll discuss it later. We said it remains blue. In fact... Stop it! The ladies are kindly asked to step out a moment. Hurry! Where are you going, Zampanò? Did your dick fall and you've become a girl? Go to your seat. And now... If you don't want me to one day make you pay for it highly, you must know one thing. I am talking to you, Zampanò, to you, Scognamiglio, and to you, Licata. Who is the son of a bitch that pissed in the test tube? - Where is Salvatore? - There he is. - He's going into heat. - Don't you ever? - Don't you ever... - Drop dead! - How did it go? - Fine. She will surely come. She'll probably bring two girlfriends. So each will choose his own. Which do you choose? What've I got to do with it? I choose to go home. I have homework to catch up on. He's worse than his father priest. He'll end up printing parish brochures and publications too. Until a few years ago, we could live with them. But today they've become so troubled, so desirous so, excitable, so impossible, that we can't stand it anymore. That is why I founded this noble organization. Which, as you know, is much appreciated from high up. I know, and I am pleased to be at your disposal. - Our motto is... - Say it. "No to man". - An absolute no? - No. We are 50, but all united and compact. We are single and want to remain that way. And single you will remain. Don't worry. If you continue the movement you've so energetically begun! Ours is a battle, and to win it, we must have a weapon! A cutting and efficient weapon, our newspaper, our organization. Oh, excuse me! Yes, your organization! - I see you understood very well. - Modestly speaking... - Listen. - What is it? For the publication of one year, coming out every week, 4 pages... How much would it cost? Let's say... Too much. Yes, a bit much. Then we'll make it... - You give the price. - I'd say... Very well! Very good. Immediate agreement is reached with people who understand each other. Excuse me, but I am busy with an important historical reconstruction. The door is over there. Remember to send the draft. We'll get to the head of this in a short time. Goodbye again. What happened? What a blow! - You'll have the draft soon. - Yes. Don't worry. You'll get it as soon as possible. Good-day. That moustache spinster! Well? Who said to take a break? - There's a banquet here. - But it's bread and baloney. As of tomorrow, bread and caviar, alright? - I could slap you. - Slap who? A good slab of pizza? Vittorio, go get a pizza with mozzarella, egg, and anchovy. He has to eat to keep in shape. As long as we finish the photo story book by this evening. Is that clear? Cleopatra, are you eating a sandwich too? - Of course. This guy went limp. - Really? - He went limp. - Marco Antonio got soft. You are getting soft. We've done this love scene 16 times. That is why I signed you up. Maybe he's a bit gay. Guys, I have a very sensitive nose tip. - Oh, come on! - I swear! Just touch it and I get uncontrolled reactions. - Liar! - You want to try? - No! - You try. - Stop it! - Come on, try. You filthy pig! Hear that engine? With a kilo of beans I do over 100 kilometers. Everyone to their places! Come on, be seated! In silence! Now stand up. Come in, miss. Please. - Thank you. - Sit down! Miss Carla Moretti will be your new teacher for the literary group. - Take advantage of her. - Yes! No comments. So... I hope you take advantage of her to recuperate the time lost since Mr. Piti retired. You surely understood that they are scoundrels. But we know everything about everyone. Right? Anyway, if you can't handle them, I am here. - Have a good day. - Thank you. My duty. - Have a good day. - Stand up! This door is full of dust. I was coming to clean it. Good. What do you want? - I am the custodian. - My pleasure. Leave now, please. Yes, madam. Kids, I am paid to teach you and I intend to do so. - Did you see what a woman? - Yes. - You like her? - Yes. - Are you in love? - Yes. - Would you marry her? - Right away. Right away! - Who talked? - Me. - What is your name? - Tonino Licata. Out. No. Come to my desk. We'll see how far your cultural preparation is. We'll begin with Italian literature. - Where did you leave off? - With the Lombardy "Scapigliatura". Sit down. So... Let's see what you remember. Look at me. Explain what the Lombardy "Scapigliatura" was, exactly. Well, they let their hair grow and it was always messed up. Somewhat like Bohemians. Aside from the hair, what did they deal with? They protested. Yes, in a certain sense, but in what way? I don't know. My head is confused. You speak, and I don't understand a thing. So I imagined. From now on, try not to disturb the class. Go back to your seat. An F. Hey, are you bewitched? You're still thinking about that F you got? Come on! No, I'm not thinking about that. - What do you want? - Open up and I'll tell you. What do you want? What more could a wife want, who for 10 years has lived in separate rooms in total abstinence? I want to sleep with you. I can't. I confessed myself today and tomorrow I must go to Communion. - I confessed, too. - You go to confession every morning. You always free yourself from sin, but I confess myself only sometimes, and would like to remain a bit free. - Free? - Free from what? - From sin! You haven't sinned with me for over 10 years. Not physically, but I sin with my mind, Adelaide. - I think of you every evening. - Then say it. Just say that you don't like me. It's not that I don't like you. It's that I can't stand you! What? What did you say? I can't stand like this when you're pushing the door. At least tell me when. Tomorrow? In a month? Give me a deadline. - Is it a promissory note? - Yes, a marriage promissory note. You must pay! Up there someone is looking at us. If someone is looking from up there, what impression will we give if we... Understand? Listen to me. Go to sleep. Up there someone is looking at us and will see that... Go! She's knocking. What do you want? I forgot to tell you something important. Tecla wrote. - Who is she? - My sister-in-law is coming soon. - She'll stay with us a month. - Who cares. I don't know her. What? She's my brother's wife. God rest his soul. - So what? - We must welcome her properly. OK. We'll pick her up at the station with a band. No. That seems exaggerated. Felice, what'll we do? You know what? Come. In your room? - Or in my room? - Over there. Felice, it doesn’t' seem true. In fact, it isn't. "I have two on my mind." "Two trembling lips." "Two well-proportioned breasts and two shining eyes that give me inspiration." "Do not fear, people say." "Seize the occasion." You don't seize a thing! That is why you're a jerk. - Zampanò, what're you doing? - What do you care? - I'll write your name. - And I'll bust your face. - And I'll erase you. - Concetta is right. If you make her angry, she'll give us a test. Your sweater is strange. - What's wrong with it? - It has two bumps here. - You do that because I'm little. - He's little, but has long hands. - Good morning, Ciccio. - Good morning, Miss Zucca. Poor thing! I'll help you. Thanks. Please... Excuse me. After you. Be careful. I barge in unexpectedly. Ciccio, you're here! Be seated! Why did you disappear like that? They must be taken by surprise. Good job! Your attention! I am like Zorro. I leave a mark. Beg your pardon. So... Let's see the register log. - What is this? - It's a dick. It looks like a phallic symbol. What did you call it? It's a dick. Your wording is mysterious. It's a boy's name. But it's fit for girls. Scoundrels! I'll take care of you! What is this thing? Don't look. I knew it was yours. - You don't know where to put it! - Silence! Scums! I'll have you suspended! No, Ciccio. Don't. It's just a kid's prank. They want to joke. They take advantage of you. You're generous... too generous! - I'll take it to the principal. - No, they're kids. No. They are taking advantage of your kindness. - Ciccio, forget it. - Of a divine creature. - Ciccio, please. - Loveliness personified! - Ciccio, please. - You wouldn't hurt a fly. - Stop. Enough! - I said to let go! This time I won't take it. Behave. She hits hard. Ciccio looked like a jerk, and got clobbered. - I'll pick you up. - Salvatore is here. Kids, I found out where that beautiful teacher lives. - She lives with Zucca. - So what? - Remember where Zucca's house is? - See you at the front door at 7. - Bring the binoculars. - You're mad. What if they catch us? Nobody goes by there. - Well? - Tell me. - What do you see? - Nothing. - What are you saying? - Did you focus the binoculars? - The window is closed. - I don't believe it! - The light is off. - I don't believe it. - You don't know what a woman is. - There's nothing to see. - It's impossible. - There must be a window. - Well? - You can't see anything. She's out. What are you saying? Get down. - Down. I'll get up. - No, I will. - Let's leave. - No, give me the binoculars. - It's my turn. - I'll go up. - It's my turn. - But there's nothing to see. - Come on! - Darn, you're heavy! - Hold me tight. She's naked! - Really? Really? Without panties? The principal sent us "Emmanuelle" as a teacher. - What is she doing? - A shower. Water is caressing her. Now she turned around revealing a nice soapy ass! - Water is flowing on her curves. - Let me see! - Alright... Wait! - Give me the binoculars. Push me up, come on! A bit more! Up! - Angelino, what do you see? - Darn you two! - Where did he go? - He fell. - What the heck did you do? - Nothing. - Did you get hurt? - Guys, don't be mean. The place is taken. It's still my turn. Don't push too much this time. - Don't worry. - Easy. There she is! She's a real hotsie! Couldn't she teach "screwology"? - What are you doing there? - I am peeing. - In the air? - What are you doing? Goodbye. - Me too. - Not you! Who will hold me? I'm slipping. Where're you going? Good morning, Miss Moretti. - Good morning. - Well? How do you like teaching this bunch of delinquents? You are biased. They are like any other kids. You'll see! If you will give me the honor of accompanying you with my car, I can tell you great stories. Thanks, but it's not possible. I have my own car. You want some advice? Entrust yourself to me. I've a lot of connections and can be very useful. If we become friends... - We're already friends, right? - Of course. We can get friendlier, can't we? Think about it. Take your time. My respects! "How lovely it would be, hand in hand, to run away with you, far, far away." - Carla, will you hurry? - I'm coming. Let's go. It's not easy. She is a teacher. You can't say, "Miss, want to go to the movies?" And then put a hand on her ass. You'll get a month in jail! For offending a public officer. What are you saying? You must seduce her the right way. A scientific trap! I studied her behavior. You'll see. Here she is. - What a woman! - Which one? - Guess! - Look. - What legs! - What legs? What everything! Guys, I found out that the teacher goes on uneven days to the Bari town library with her car. Tomorrow is Wednesday. I'll be waiting for her and will stop her with an excuse. I've a secret plan she'll fall for. The usual: sex and brains. Plus charm and savoir-faire. - Sure she'll go along with you? - A beginner's question! I'll tell you where the appointment is. Come watch the performance, free of charge. - Alright. - Let's go now. It's late. - I'm staying here. - You're not coming with us? No, I don't feel like it. You think I'll cry over you? I don't give a darn! I don't give a hell of a darn! Who knows you? Who are you? You want to go to bed with Salvatore? Alright, go! Too bad for you. You can do it. It doesn't matter. I know who you are. You're a slut! Look at how he's become! A handsome boy with everything in the right places. You're a bit pale and I know the reason. I'll bet you already have a girlfriend. Tecla, what are you saying? - No? - I wish! You're not playing solitaire yet, are you? - Yes? - Darn! What about this moving? After poor Micuzzo passed away, I returned to my home in Treviso. I was a substitute in Treviso as I was also before. - I didn't lose anything. - Aside from your husband. Yes, and I still miss him. You'll find the domestic warmth of a home here. I hope so! My warmth has gone now. If the man tending to the fire is gone, it's over. Really over! - My napkin. - Felice! - Did your napkin fall? - Yes. - You want to change it? - Someone has to tend it. Tend... tender. Yes! - The chicken is tender. - It must have been terrible. You must've gone through terrible moments. So unexpectedly. He was a perfect man. Home and work, work and home. He was always close to me, affectionate, loving. Strong, so strong! Then he began to wither away. He slowly went out, like a candle. - And in the end... - He died. - Yes, unfortunately. - You don't want to tend the fire? Let's not think about it anymore. - You must force yourself to eat. - I'm not hungry. Do you prefer another piece of chicken? The leg. - She already as a leg. - Give her another one. Sure. Two leg. Two nice legs! The breast is good too. Darn! It's all I needed! Miss Moretti, what happened to you? Luckily you came by. I got a flat tire and don't know where to begin. - Don't worry. I'll do it. - There they are. They stopped. She's talking to Salvatore. - She seems happy. - Happy, huh? - You want to look? - No, thanks. - Then why did you come? - I wanted to try the binoculars. With my eyes? Look. He kneeled in front of her. This flat tire is really unfortunate. I'm already late. I've an appointment with Miss Zucca. - So what! She's not a handsome guy. - I don't feel that way. - Don't you like handsome guys? - You're saying strange things. Here's the bus. How fortunate! Do me a favor. - Finish, and take it to the garage. - I've almost finished. Take your time. Bye, and thanks. - Miss Moretti! - Bye! That bus had to come by! "Bye", my ass!" "Take your time!" - Did she leave? - She's a fantastic woman. With class. She didn't want to make love here on the road. And so? She wanted us to separate just to be cautious. She left me her car and wants me to join her at the motel. She went ahead to get ready. - Give me a hand. - Of course. - Will you give us a ride? - Certainly. Let's go. - Are you ready? - Ready. Darn it! We have a flat tire. Look... I'd like to know what jackass put these nails here. - Who could it be? - Who can that jackass be? I told you I don't know how to be an actress. It's not about being an actress. It's about photographs for a photo story book. Understand? In episodes! "Messalina". "Messalina"! May I be less formal? - Of course. - Thank you. And frankly, where could I ever have found a Messalina like you? Messalina? She was a big slut. Yes, but empress. I am no empress. - As long as you can be a slut. - What? Just try. It takes art! Besides, I'm a serious publisher. I wouldn't downgrade you. Before having you be Messalina, you know what I'll do? - I'll have you do a screen test. - What? I'll have you do a nice screen test. I'll have you do a screen test. I won't put you in the lions' den. Here. What is this place? The cradle from where stars are born and say their first sounds. - Get undressed. - Are you getting undressed too? Was Nero dressed when he did Messalina's screen test? Come on! Next time we'll talk about the recent discovery of astronomers, and precisely the field of gravitation that survives the death of a star, meaning, the black hole. - May I ask you a question? - Certainly. Isn't this part of sexual education? Bravo! Sexual education! How funny! Bravo! Come with me. Be silent! Get the agenda. We'll see how funny you are. Come here. You're so funny! Sexual education! Bravo! - What is going on? - It's the engine starting. The engine starting! You insist! Let's write this too. The student Zampanò has an improper and uncivil attitude. - Have Dad sign this. - He doesn't know how to write. He doesn't know how to write? Then have Mom sign it. - She is illiterate. - Really? Then you know what? Have them come here. I'll tell them. Or are they deaf? - Absolutely. - Go to your seat. To your seat! And now, even without your permission, I've the pleasure of getting rid of your company. Goodbye. Stand up! Open the door. Hold still! Stop, don't move. That's it. - Excuse me. - A small accident. But we are insured. Please. I'll close it. Be seated. Go to your place. "I am still, immobile as a rock." "Only my soul follows you, one step at a time." Open your anthology to page 61. - Come on! - Come on! - Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye, Ciccio. - Bye. Look. Ciccio is here. He has flowers. - You have that? Give it. - Don't play such jokes. - He's in love, poor thing. - I'll take care of it. - No! - Enough! You must stop it. - Are you arguing? - I'll bust your face! What is this commotion? - Go on, leave. - What did I do to you? Are you crazy? Put your hands down and go home because it's late. - You'll see. - Hold still. - Bye. - I'll take care of you. Miss Zucca, excuse me. - What is it? - These are for you. Thank you! Does the councilor send them? No. It's a small gift. A bouquet of flowers, a small thought for you. - Did I dare too much? - You shouldn't do these things. I didn't make it! I know that you're a teacher and I'm a modest custodian. I should keep a distance, but I couldn't throw them to you. Of course. That is nonsense. Besides our positions, you are a man and I'm a woman. - A beautiful one! - A custodian is useful at home. - Did you say at home? - Yes. I mean... If I should ever marry, I wouldn't look at my husband's job. What matters is that he is a good person. Be quiet. What a coincidence! I am a good person. I know, Ciccio. Then may I hope? Of course. A person who has such sweet thoughts can always hope. What a lovely smell! - What is the matter? - Nothing. Did you lose your courage? I didn't dare. You seemed to have changed your mood. You've darkened. Darkened, me? I have never been so happy. Well, I wanted to propose something. You rascal! No, don't misjudge me. A nice trip. A weekend. From Saturday to Monday! Did I dare too much? It seems like a magnificent idea. Then Saturday... That is tomorrow. - Yes, tomorrow. - Black, black! Oh, what a black face! Black! Oh, what a black face! One day, with a punch, I'll shove their asses between their ears. Good for you! You are a continuous revelation. I didn't know you were politically active. Politics? I'd like to see them wash their faces in the bidet. - So, Ciccio... - See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Black, black, black! What a nice black face. Black... Miss Zucca! What happened? She uses a vibrator. I wonder how much I'll pay for electricity this month! Are you shaving? There too! Great! My aunt Tecla! What is it? - What happened? - I thought you fell from the bed. The noise came from the other side. Tonino! Nothing. I was looking for the racket, and fell. There it is. The boy left it because all the wheels are flat. I don't believe it. These young modern kids are criminals. - He did it. - What? He punctured them. He put a hole in them. What advantage would he have had? Sadism doesn't look for advantages. It's just sadism. Anyway, I brought the four wheels. We'll put them on, after. Why don't you get near the car? Take it easy. What's the rush? I said "after". First let's talk a bit. About what? She says about what? About you, Miss Moretti. Maybe you don't realize the situation you're in. These kids are spoiled, corrupted. They enjoy the protection of important parents. They'll certainly corner you. In what sense? I don't understand. In what sense? In all senses. You understand? So... You need a person to support you, who is on your side. - You're that person? What an intelligent woman! You guessed. You were very kind to come all this way. But now accompany me to my car. What are you doing? Changing the subject? Let's be clear about one thing. I am proposing something very precise. It's a proposal that you can't refuse. Understand? I can do a lot for you. I don't need anything. Let me go. Watch out! If someone knocks on my door, it will always be open. What is the saying? The door is open for who brings. So what will you bring? - Leave me alone! How dare you! - No! I won't leave you. I will have you live. I'll teach you love. - Enough! - I want to do everything with you! - No! - Then I'll use strong measures. What a slap! Woman, remember that you slapped me! You remember that, filthy pig! You will need me. You'll knock on my door. As of this moment, my door will remain closed. Closed! Enough! - Closed! - Go to hell, idiot! Guys, I have a great idea. I'll swipe Zucca's key and when she leaves for the weekend, I'll go in the house and wait. - What'll you say to Moretti? Wait. This is the good part. She won't find me. I'll be hiding, and when she goes to bed, I'll come out and start to touch her. - And then? - I'll touch her breasts with a hand. - With the other, her thighs. - And with the other, her ass. - I only have two hands. - It's mine. You'll leave me here? - Two of us will be stronger. - With you, it's one and a half. The professor is an exploiter. This time Finocchiaro screwed me. Painting the principal office rooms on Saturday and Sunday. They need it. When the students are here, there's too much confusion. - It's impossible. - He can stay and watch. Now I must spend the weekend with the painters. White-washing the walls! Ciccio, don't get upset. There will be another chance. I am sorry, especially for you, Miss Zucca. Still calling me "Miss Zucca"? When we speak privately, you can use my first name. I really can? Miss... Gina, you'll allow me that? - No, I demand it. - My darling! - Caution. - Yes. - My respects, miss. - You want a ride? - Yes, thanks. Goodbye. - My respects. What flowers! The rose and a bouquet. - Will you come shopping with me? - I'd prefer going home. - I am a bit tired. Do you mind? - No, I'll accompany you. Alright. I can't find my keys. Thank you. Darn! What a nerve! He's worse than "Casanote"! - Casanova! Ignoramus! - Meanwhile, he went in the house. Oh, my God! What are you doing here? How did you get in? Excuse me. I'd come to see you. The door and the shower were open. You came to see me? What do you want? - I came for something. - What? - Something. But now... - Come on. Talk. - My father is ill. - What've I got to do with it? I didn't study and tomorrow I have the oral test. - And so? - Can you give me a private lesson? Private lesson under the shower? And maybe naked. Alright. Go on. Start reading and I'll join you. Naked! - Damn it all. - What did you say? - I didn't read well. - Be careful. - Damn it all. - I'd heard correctly. Good. Now tell me the aorist. Eresa? - What's she like in bed? - Exceptional. A volcano! OK, and the future? What is the future? - Will you see her again? - Of course. She'll go live alone and we'll spend every night together. I'll come. Take me with you. Oh, God! - He felt ill. - What happened? - Open the window. - Back up. Let him breathe. What's wrong? Nothing. He passed out. - How do you feel? - I feel fine. Thank you. Don't worry about me. Why lose sleep? Why suffer? It's over now. I didn't lose you. I lost my life. What is it? - Why that face? - Auntie, I can't sleep. Is that why you're crying? For so little? You could have come here. Come. Aunt Tecla will take care of you. Lie down. Cover up. Go to sleep. - Did you turn off the light? - You talk too much. - Salvatore isn't here? - He must be tired. Be seated! - Absent? - Scognamiglio. Why? He is too weak. Silence! She's pissed off because she didn't find him. She must be a bit jealous. - What are you saying? - Me? Nothing. Salvatore says that maybe she's a bit pregnant. And you tell me about it? What do I care? Too bad for her. Page 37, chapter 23. Licata, do you think it's too sunny here? You don't need these. What are you doing? Crying? Me? No. I put them on because my eyes are burning. Darn! What is wrong with this car? Look. What a car! Why didn't you come this morning? Her car doesn't work. Go get her. It's a big scene. She's doing it as an excuse to come with me. She's shrewd too! When a woman is in love, she's worse than a fox. - Right. - I'm leaving. You're not coming? No. I want to enjoy the show. And you? Nothing doing. The battery is dead. Come in my car. I must communicate something important to you. Yes? What is it? I've decided to open the door again. Yes. You are new here. And as they say... You have a right to a make-up exam. I realized that you did not understand my force. - You didn't understand my power. - I understood perfectly well. - You want to be slapped again. - Miss, don't provoke me. Listen. If I wanted, I could have you disappear forever. Good for you! You even do magic tricks. I never play around. I see. You're from Anonymous Kidnapping. Tell the Anti-Mafia! Don't you see these eyes? Don't you understand this look? Come in the car with me. I'll translate it. Come on. She's coming. Miss, do you want a ride? Yes, thank you. My car won't start. - What happened? - Nothing. Can you speed up? Yes, but something happened. Mr. Finocchiaro is tormenting me. - He's even following us. - We'll get rid of him. - I can stop. He won't find us here. - Good job. - Let's go back now. - Yes, we'll go now. I feel a bit sorry for Finocchiaro. It's not his fault. - Whose fault is it, then? - You are a very lovely girl. What are you saying? Let's go. Yes, we'll go. But since this place is secluded and peaceful, we can stay here a bit. How dare you? Have you gone mad? - Turn the car and let's go. - Yes, but not before I... Stupid, presumptuous boy! Don't do that. Come here. You want to oblige me to use my authority. Then you know what this presumptuous kid says to you? - You know what this is? - No. It's the distributor cap of your car that I removed. - That's why it wouldn't start. - A sabotage! And because of this prank you didn't even come to school. Call it as you wish, but now you're here and have fallen in the trap. You're very shrewd. What do you want to do now? - You want to rape me? - I don't think it's necessary. Let's reach an agreement. I'll offer my experience in women and in exchange, you'll promote me. It's a deal for both. - Alright. Let's make this deal. - Really? Of course. How can I resist a Casanova like you. - Kiss me. - No. - Not here. - Wherever you want. Where? There's a place over there that seems very intimate. - I'll go get ready and you... - Meanwhile, I'll get undressed. How brazen! You'll join me. Love, where are you? Where are you going? Stop! Wait! Darn it! You took my clothes and you made an ass of me! - Hi, Ciccio. - Madam. I borrowed it. - You like it? - How nice! It's small, but it's a jewel. - Shall we go? - Let's go. Please. No. Better this way, or we must turn the car around. All set? That is why it didn't close. Did you hurt yourself? OK, let's go. Hold on tight. This speeds like a rocket. Just a moment. I'll check the spark plugs. Darn the spark plugs! Let's see... - Is something the matter? - No, everything is fine. Luckily, I know where to put my hands. With a small push, it'll start right away. I understand. I'll take care of it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come! Did you see? It left like a rocket. Luckily, it all worked out. At times some nonsense is enough to ruin the day. - Thank heavens! - Let's go. The seat broke! Wait. I'll help you. How indecent! This is too much. Enough. I'm leaving. Gina, wait. Where are you going? The usual jokes. They knock and no one is there. - Good night. - Good night. - More. - More? - It's too much. - I am terrible, huh? You've been doing the same thing for 10 days. You're right. Is it bad for you? No, but go on. You can barely stand up. Who, me? Go back to bed, or you'll make me feel guilty. Go. Go. What happened? It's Tonino always fooling around with the racket. Doctor, will my son live? Adelaide, you want to be a jinx? The boy is perfectly healthy. He is just somewhat withered and has a bit of nervous breakdown. Maybe he studied too much. - Or played tennis too much. - He sweats. - You sweat when you play tennis. - Anyway, I gave him a therapy. - Everything will be fine now. - Understand? Let him rest. - Thank you and goodbye. - Goodbye. I'll accompany you. Where are you going? To see if he needs anything. He doesn't, and if he does, Tecla is here. - What? - There's his aunt. - So I can rest assured? - With Tecla? - Absolutely. - Alright then. With Tecla, of course... I'll be right there, Doctor. I will accompany you. One day I'll do a checkup with you too. You hear a squeaking? It's not the stairs, but my joints. I know what your ailment is. I found out. Dear, Tonino! You're in love with someone called Carla, right? - How do you know? Who told you? - You. - I did not! - Yes, little one. Every time you made love with me, you made love with her. My name is Tecla, not Carla. You always called me Carla. Are you crying now? - I'm sorry, auntie. - Don't worry! - Who is Carla? - My teacher. - A teacher. - Yes. Why would she have a lovely boy like you suffer? She never noticed. She is Salvatore's lover. This is Troy and you are Helen. - I am Marisa. - No, you're Helen and be quiet. - I am Helen and I'll be quiet. - OK, first photo. Come down looking regal, very regal. Head high and chest out! Chest out. That's it! Immobile. Second photo. - He is Achilles. - I know. He knows, and you don't. Third photo. While you are lying down... lie down. Lie down. That's it. Gently, enjoying the sun, Achilles, who is excited... Excited! I know. Jumps on top of you. And I move. You move, he breaks, and the photo book is over. - What's gotten into you? - Sir! - What is it? - Excuse me a moment. Achilles, don't jump. Wait. - What is it? - A lady is looking for you. - For me? - Yes. - Who is she? - I've never seen her before. I've seen that ass before. Tecla. This is it. Tecla, what brings you here? - I... - Don't talk. I know. You are a widow who's a bit too agitated. You're need something satisfying, and you came to me. You don't understand. I didn't come for you. - I came for Tonino. - What's he have to do with it? We must do something for him. No, we must do something for me. We've all done everything for Tonino. Now we're having him cured. He won't recover with medicines. Tonino is in love. Of course! Between a forehand and backhand with that racket in your room, I'd have fallen in love too. Tecla, when do you want to play a nice set together? No. You don't understand. Tonino is not in love with me. He confessed that he is in love with his teacher. - His teacher? - Yes. He's crazy. We must do something. What can we do? Ask for the teacher's hand at the Ministry of Public Education. Don't be funny. Please, you must help him. - I must help him! - Yes. This information is coming so unexpectedly. Tonino is my son, and she is his teacher. - Anyway, I'll do something. - Good for you. Come on! Tecla, why shouldn't I worry? The boy got out of school at 4. It's 9 o'clock. How can I not worry? - Where is Felice? - Here I am! - Well? - Your son has disappeared! No. I meant what's for dinner? I know that Tonino isn't here. I accompanied him to the station. - The station? - Yes. - He left. - Yes. - What? - Adelaide. Where did he go? - Relax. - Why? - Be strong. - Yes. I'll tell you everything. So... - Tonino was very depressed. - It's true. - He was very tense, in a crisis. - A lot? A lot! I suggested to him to leave, devoutly, and in God's holy grace to ask the Madonna of Loreto, to answer his prayer, in Loreto. - He went to Loreto? - Yes. On the site, prayers are answered better. It's so dark! Look what they did! My pocket knife! There. Darn! I couldn't breathe. You could've removed it right away. It's true. - But it looked so good on you. - Yes. Why are you here? I don't know. I was kidnapped. - Excuse me, Tecla. - Oh, no! No, don't cover up. In fact, get comfortable. I can't sleep in the other room. I'm nervous, excited. I toss and turn... I know that Tonino is in good hands, and maybe he's even having fun, but I am his father. With so many girls around, he falls in love with his teacher! I wonder how embarrassed he is right now. If she's a good teacher, she'll see it is a critical moment for the kid. - For who? - For the kid, the boy. The boy? The kid! These is an important moment. And not only for kids, but even for us adults. At times, even we adults, sometimes can say, "I like that woman a lot." "She really excites me." "I'd love to go to bed with her." And maybe you really go to bed with her. Then you feel embarrassed. You feel greatly embarrassment. But you're not embarrassed. You got inside my bed. - Really? - Yes. You're right. You see? At times, when speaking... Should I get up? No, stay, you big moron. You could have been kidnapped because your father is rich. He could pay a big ransom. But what use am I to them? Unless... I know! Mr. Finocchiaro. I had forgotten him. He persecutes me and he even threatened me. - Why? - You can't imagine? He offered his protection and I refused it. So he said he'd make me disappear. I don't like his face. What if it's the beginning or revenge? - That must be it. - What've I got to do with it? You're right. What is going on? I don't understand. Finocchiaro is just a harmless idiot. Don't worry about him, but about someone else. Who? Salvatore, your lover. It's what he says! Everyone knows! - I'm sorry. - Well, I am very happy. These are the most wonderful slaps of my life. It means that Salvatore is a scoundrel, and he's never even laid a finger on you, because I, Carla... I mean, miss... - Since the day you gave me an F... - Be silent and listen. There is another man in my life, one who is sweet and shy. But maybe he doesn't love me enough because he's afraid of being known. I've never seen him, but I've tried imagining him. He must be very young, cute, delicate. He writes silly poems that I like very much. "I am still, immobile like a rock." "Only my soul follows you, step by step." "It observes you, spies on you, and to follow you..." "It has forgotten about me, ignoble creature, cold and immobile like a rock." When did you realize it? When I corrected your translation in class. I recognized your handwriting. Please, tell me it's not a dream. It is not a dream. Listen. They've left. That is my car. - You understand what's going on? - No. - Bye, Tonino. - Bye. Salvatore, Tonino is back from Loreto. - Are you crazy? - Calm down! Calm down! You'll kill him! Stop! You are friends! Scoundrel! It's not true that you're Carla's lover! I'll bust your face! I'll massacre you! Stop them! Kids, unfortunately, Miss Moretti won't be coming anymore. She obtained a steady position and is leaving for Rome. - What? - What did you say? Nothing. It seemed strange, so unexpectedly. It happens. Start writing the lesson in prose from the XVI Canto. - Punch my nose immediately. - Are you crazy? - I beg you. - No. I could kill you. - Jackass. Idiot. - Yeah, sure. - Your sister is a slut. - I don't have sisters. - If you did, she'd be a slut. - I don't care. - Big farter. - Not that. - Silence! - Excuse me. I must go out. Poor thing! Go. Blood from his nose! Did he hit it? You're leaving without telling me anything? Unexpected instructions arrived from Rome. Someone pressured the Ministry. I wanted to avoid this. I don't like to say goodbye. - Then you're sorry you saw me. - No, on the contrary. I was hoping for this. You say you want to see me, but you're leaving. I don't understand women. We women are weak, just as you men are. But in our case, I'm the one who should be wise. - I am your teacher. - You're saying I am a kid? No, you're not a kid. I assure you of that. But you have the bad habit of feeling sorry for yourself. I love you, and want to leave with you. You don't love me, you love love. There are many young girls who are younger and prettier than I am. Don't be afraid of face them. Bye, Tonino. Go now. Remember, you must face them with self-confidence. It's all they're waiting for. Bye. Bye! Bye, Tonino! Yes, I'll face them. Wow!! - Excuse me. May I take your bags? - No, thanks. - How spiteful! - Especially with minors. In bed I'm a stallion, and women faint in my arms. Disgusting scoundrel! - Hi, dear. - Who are you? I'm Ciccio! You're Ciccio! The humble custodian left his place to the Masked Man. Come on. Let's dive into this adventure. I changed vehicles. This one is more sporty. Get inside. - May I try it? Do you mind? - No. It's a big honor for me. I'll help. What did I do? Don't worry. Once it starts, it won't ever stop. Get in. Ready? Let's go. This isn't a motorbike, it's a rocket. My sweetheart. - How much? - 20,000 Super. - This won't take that much. - And I don't have that much. I'm funny, huh? Clean the glass, too. What glass? My glasses! Darn! Is this an oil tanker? We wasted some gasoline, but if you had some soil spots, they went away. Where are you going? Wait for me, Ciccio! Good thing you are back. I was worried. Shall I go left? - What happened? - In my presence! I farted and didn't realize it? I'm having him eat my dust. You gave up, huh? A ghost! Too bad! If we'd kissed earlier, we'd have made an artichoke omelet. - An Amaretto di Saronno. - For me, a Biancosarti. - You didn't do much with one ball. - What about your dad with two? But at least he enjoyed it! I'll go see if they're coming. They're coming! Going on a wagon? Was this door here before? - Your hand! - This is my royal palace. - I even have an English lawn. - That's chicory. I'm no jerk. I don't eat grass. This place puts me in a good mood, makes me feel lighter. - Let's fly! - Oops! - Is something the matter? - I don't know. It won't open. Some idiot put chewing gum in it. But we won't get discouraged. Love has no obstacles. Let's go through the window. No problem. Hold the basket. - Yeah! - I'll get something to climb on. Is it the French Revolution again? I'll put the key here. Don't worry. I'll help you. Go on. Go on. Go on up. Up! Up! I said get up, not get down. The pavement must have given in. - Shall we eat outside? - No, better inside. - It's like the circus. - Be quiet. Go! I'll follow you. Is it a sack race? What'll we do now? We didn't come here to sit down. Look at what a sweet thought I had for you. - How lovely! - Dearest! Let's toast to our first day of love. Nothing will happen to me, right, dear? No, don't worry. There... Darn it! I'll help you. Sit down. Down. Open. There! Shall we turn on some music? They had guaranteed this bed for 20 years. Everyone to their places! Licata, what're you up to? Pornography? Don't move! That's it. Come, miss. Please. Be seated. Miss De Santis will be your new teacher for the literary group. I hope you will take advantage of her... You be quiet! I hope you'll take advantage of her to finally carry on with the program. I demand maximum respect and maximum effort. Is that clear? Have a good day, miss. Remember, if you need me for anything, my door is always open. - Thank you. - Excuse me. Stand up, kids. Be seated. First of all, I'd like to see how far you've gotten with the program. You, come here. - Me? - Yes, you. - What is your name? - Tonino Licata. Good. We'll start with Greek. How far have you gotten with Euripides? Did you study? It's a bit of a tragedy. I imagine that Homer is a massacre and Thucydides, a slaughter. Poor thing. It's not his fault. He's obliged to work. You carry luggage, right? Silence! Let's go on to the Lyric poets. What do you know about Sappho? I don't know. My head is confused. You talk to me, and I don't understand a thing. Go to your seat. An F. They all start with an F and then they are never satisfied!
