LILIA GRANDA: He was a cute, little, blond baby. Everyone loved him-- Adorable. He was the typical, annoying little brother. We have a seven-year difference. GIANCARLO: My childhood was pretty much normal, you know, in Miami standards. MARK EBNER: Giancarlo may seem a little aloof, a little guarded. That's just him being a product of his upbringing. He was raised in a conservative Catholic family in Miami. - Write to me, Jerry Falwell-- MARK: His mom grew up on The Old-Time Gospel Hour, courtesy of Jerry Falwell Sr. She was very religious. She was a true believer. LILIA: As a child, he was always the social kid. He made friends everywhere he went. - I went to a Catholic high school called St. Brendan High School.

GIANCARLO: Just spent an unhealthy amount of time playing video games. It became a problem. My personality just completely transformed. I started to isolate, withdraw. - He became introverted, antisocial. GIANCARLO: My ability to feel comfortable in a social setting was, uh, compromised. Like, I just-- I didn't wanna be out with friends. I didn't feel comfortable. LILIA: It was rough to experience 'cause no one really knew how to handle it. GIANCARLO: My parents, my sister, they were very supportive during that time. It was a dark period for me. - It was sad and-- and hard for all of us, especially my parents because they didn't really know how to handle it. GIANCARLO: After high school, I told myself, "I need to change my life," so I started eating healthy, started working out. But I was still that shy, reserved kid. I still had insecurities. I wanted to-- to work and experience life, and-- and actually, make money and save money. So I reached out to a friend that worked at the Fontainebleau Hotel. - That's when he really started coming out of his shell, dating girls, having a social life. He was doing good. He was excited about school, excited about his future. GIANCARLO: I worked at the Fontainebleau for one year. I was working full-time and going to school part-time.

Just go for it. I'm gonna sit right here, and, uh, you guys do your thing." We start kissing, we were feeling each other up. And then she said, "Anything but. No penetration, no actual sex, just oral sex." We're kissing, and, you know, we go back to the bed.

Ultimately, it's a guy who likes to watch. "I'm fulfilled on a sexual level by watching my wife with a Cuban stallion." GIANCARLO: I kept looking back, and I saw him, like, in the corner. He was trying to hide. He didn't want himself being exposed or anything. He just wanted to observe the situation. I wish the husband wasn't there. That would've been a better situation. That's what I was telling myself at the time. As a horny 20-year-old, I'm like, "I'm gonna block this out, I'm gonna have sex with this cougar." Instantly, like, there was this connection. She was staring at me. I could tell that she obviously wanted to do this again. ♪ The next day, we hung out again at the Fontainebleau. I knew what I was getting myself into at that point. After we finished, we actually hung out and we talked. And they said what their names were, you know, Jerry and Becki. "Wow, nice to meet you guys." They said that they help out a lot of young people, and if I ever need help that they can definitely help me out. We were talking about politics. We had, you know, common beliefs. I-- I was raised Republican. I remember Becki said, "He's perfect." It was nice connecting with them and just humanizing the situation. It wasn't just these strangers anymore. After they left Miami, she gave me a really good review on Tripadvisor. I didn't have her last name. I didn't really know who they were, until I-- I got an email on March 22nd.

REPORTER: TV preacher, Dr. Jerry Falwell, whose doctorate is honorary, not earned, turned a small Virginia church of 35 into a Christians communications empire. Falwell preaches to a church of 4,000 each Sunday, with a TV audience of 20 million. JERRY FALWELL SR.: I believe these are the last days. What is the thing that interests God the most? Getting people ready for his coming, getting people ready for the sounding of the cross. - He founded Liberty University in 1971. REPORTER: A school for 50,000 students, from kindergarten right through a doctoral program. - We have what we think is a boot camp here for the Lord, training soldiers for Christ. - He founded Moral Majority a few years later.

I later found out her father was in trailer parks, and went to prison for tax evasion. - Becki, tell 'em how you proposed to me. - Falwell Jr. went to Liberty University with Becki's older sister. - Yeah, I proposed to Jerry. He had finished law school, and he had taken the bar exam. MEGAN: She dropped out of Liberty to support Jerry, who was down at the University of Virginia. - And I said, "Can we get married now?" And he said, "Yes." MEGAN: Becki said to me, with sort of embarrassment, "Oh, we had the most boring wedding of anybody ever. There was no drinking alcohol. There was no dancing. It was just awful." MARK: And they popped out three kids, Trey, Wesley, and Caroline. MEGAN: These are two people who have, for a long time, been and remain very much in love. I don't see any daylight between them. They're just extremely intertwined, psychologically and emotionally. It's very unusual to come across a married couple like that. JERRY JR.: My father, he would tell his congregation, "Don't get mad when people tell lies about you, just be glad they don't know the truth." So. [audience laughing] MEGAN: In some ways, Jerry was a black sheep. A son who was not able to access the kind of religious fervor that defined his father and that was going to define his family. - Jerry Jr. had not been a conventional evangelical. He believed that his role to support the ministry would be in business. MEGAN: He did set out doing real estate law and not working with his father. He came back to help get the university out of financial distress. JERRY JR.: I spent many days negotiating with creditors and spent many weekends begging and borrowing from donors and lenders to cover the paychecks that had already been issued on the Friday before. DUSTIN WAHL: Falwell Jr. was never a good fit to be in a public-facing role. It wasn't something that he sought out and asked for. He inherited it when his father passed away. MEGAN: He was a hero to Liberty, financially. It brought Jerry Falwell money. It brought him power. It gave him the tacit approval of his father, even after his father's death. MARK: If you're part of this dynasty, then you can do whatever the fuck you want, and that couple did it to the hilt. [indistinct chatter] DUSTIN: He was beloved by a lot of students for his quirkiness. People didn't treat him like he was the spokesperson for one of the largest Christian and Conservative institutions in the world. People treated him like he was a cartoon character, or their crazy uncle. He realized that that familiarity students felt with him gave him a lot of power.

The sleeping arrangement was, I slept on the bed with Becki and, you know, Jerry slept, uh, next to the bed. Which, you know, thinking back, it's kind of strange. It was, I don't know, like 5:00 in the morning, and I just-- I randomly woke up, and I look over to the side and Becki's just staring at me. She has these dark black eyes. I obviously kept hooking up with her, but, you know, I'm like, "This is kinda weird."

We really connected 'cause we would talk about business, how he was a real estate attorney, how he developed real estate. And he would tell me about Liberty University, how, you know, they were doing over $100 million in construction projects. LILIA: You go to Lynchburg, Virginia, and they own half of the real estate in that town.

And they're like, "Hey, come over and we can discuss how we can become business partners." So I meet them, and I stayed the weekend with them. We stayed at the Gansevoort Hotel on Park Avenue. We're at dinner at STK, and I was really worried that someone was gonna discover us and it's gonna end up in the tabloids. We're looking through the dessert menu, and Becki spotted the Carnival Menage A Trois. And she was like, "Oh, let's get this." And I-- I remember just feeling awkward when she ordered the Carnival Menage A Trois. Like, they're not being subtle about this. But after dinner, we're talking, and that's when he said, "You need to make money yourself. "With my past in real estate, it's a great way to build wealth. "We'll acquire a property and we'll give you an equity stake in it. "You just have to manage it. "And then, you know, when you make your first million, "we'll all drink champagne together and life is gonna be great." Deep down, I always wanted to invest in real estate. I wanted to get in the game. I'm like, "This is it!" - I thought, "Well, maybe they can help him in some way, "and however weird this thing started, maybe it'll turn into something good."

MEGAN: They were both kind of looking for these things that weren't actually available to them within their religious community. Granda is part of that desire that they shared. MARK: He was that element of kink that they needed for them to become closer, if you will. GIANCARLO: Fast forward, I'm back in Miami looking for properties. I actually started driving around by myself. I narrowed it down to Miami Beach. - What is happening? What do you know about any of this? Like, you're 20. He was like, "I know, like, what I'm doing, "I know the right people. Like, we're gonna get this done." And he relied on the Fernandezes. ♪ GIANCARLO: I reached out to a friend of mine at the time, Jesus Fernandez Jr. We called him Tito. That was his nickname. And his dad, Jesus Fernandez Sr., he was a broker. LILIA: Him and his dad are like your classic wannabe, just Miami bullshit artists. It never really made sense how he was friends with him, honestly. - I met Giancarlo through Jesus. Giancarlo and Jesus were kind of like best friends. I was Jesus' girlfriend, and I was very close with them. I mean, everybody changed in the five years that I dated Jesus, they kinda grew up. But Giancarlo did not strike me as having any street smarts. Nothing, not even an instinct. He doesn't really have a hustle spirit. Jesus was the street-smart hustler of the group. When I met him, I was absolutely under the impression that that was a wealthy family. MARK: Jesus Fernandez Sr. was, at one point, a big-time real estate investor and a broker. That family had lived the American Dream. NICOLE: The houses that they lived in were gorgeous. Unfortunately, none of them lasted long before... the sheriff's department came. MARK: If you look at Jesus Sr.'s rap sheet, there was a major bankruptcy, there were allegations of fraud. The guy didn't even have a broker license anymore. None of this was disclosed to Giancarlo. GIANCARLO: By me reaching out to them and telling, "Hey, you're gonna get a commission from this," I felt like I was helping them out. ♪ NICOLE: I was an assistant general manager working at South Beach Hostel. I mean, in Miami, hostels, you build it and it's gonna be filled. It's like a fail-safe business. - Jesus knew the real estate side, I knew the hostel side, and Giancarlo had the financial backing. - I called Jerry, I said, "Hey, come down. I have some guys that are gonna find the best investment property." NICOLE: Jesus and Giancarlo, his father eventually found a property. It was Miami Hostel. The first floor had a restaurant and a liquor store. GIANCARLO: It was just in the heart of South Beach, which is perfect. The land itself is very valuable. LILIA: Once the Fernandezes saw these evangelicals come down here, they probably saw, you know, just nothing but money signs everywhere. MARK: This is a guy from Lynchburg trying to do business in Miami. He didn't know where the fuck he was. They should've done diligence on these guys. NICOLE: I understood flying him places, but I have never heard of anybody buying some kid, that they met at the Fontainebleau pool, a four-and-a-half-million-dollar business. What the fuck? Like, what's going on? GIANCARLO: Tito and his dad were both very curious, and they were trying to find out what was going on. And they kept trying to get answers out of me. I'm like, "No, they just wanna help me out." Obviously, that didn't make sense. That-- That was just-- That was-- You know, it wasn't a good excuse. I think that they-- they were convinced there was more to it, and they were right, there was more to it. - Now you got the Fernandezes working Giancarlo, because they're smelling money, real money. The long con had already started. Who knew what a buddy fucker Jesus Fernandez turned out to be, right? LILIA: It was a few months for the deal to actually close. Throughout this process, my brother and Tito, their friendship started fracturing a bit. GIANCARLO: The Fernandezes received their commission on the sale of the property, and we didn't really talk much after that. It was just like, all right, the deal closed, and then they kind of just vanished. LILIA: Between the time that he met the Falwells to when they closed on that property was less than a year. - About 11 months after meeting them, we're closing on a 4.65-million-dollar commercial property. It just felt like I was living in a movie. It just didn't feel real. I'm like, "Why am I here? Why am I a part of this?" LILIA: Imagine the first property you own is a four-and-a-half-million-dollar property. GIANCARLO: I saw it as a big opportunity to learn, to grow within business. It was tough to turn down. - Okay, so how did the deal break down? Who was the principal in name? It wasn't Jerry. He didn't want his name anywhere near that deal with a 20-year-old pool boy, so he put it in Becki's name. - At this point, my dreams were coming true. I can see how I can make that first million. - How do you keep Giancarlo on a leash? Go into business with him. And Jerry was looking at keeping his wife happy at that point. Where she was happiest was when Giancarlo Granda was balls-deep inside of her. - So from March 2012 till about, like, June, June, July, you know, we had this sexual component with the relationship. I broke it off. I told Becki, I'm like, "We can't have sex anymore "'cause I found a girl my age. I wanna date her, I like her a lot. We obviously can't be doing this." She didn't take it very well. Becki cried. She made me feel guilty for it. "Oh, you replaced me for someone younger." She would tell me, "God put us together." I'm like, "I need to live my own life. I need to find someone my age." And then Jerry said, "Well, she doesn't have to know. We won't tell her." And I said, "No, I'm sorry, I just-- I can't. I-- I don't feel comfortable doing it." What I did agree to, and it's not-- it's not right, I continued the emotional connection. I kept texting her, I kept talking to her every day. I felt like I was living a double life. Becki, she would call me every day, she would text me every day. If I didn't respond to her right away, she would call me crying. If I didn't respond for a couple days, then Jerry would call me. He was disappointed. He'd say, "Hey, what's going on? Like, she loves you so much. "Why are you trying to break away? She's been so nice to you. "And we're going to bat for you for this property. Why-- why break up now?" Things started slowly morphing into, "Oh, this is just sex and friendship," to "Now we're gonna control you." LILIA: Imagine how sick and twisted that is. Like, you're middle-aged people calling him, making him feel bad because he's not texting your wife? What the fuck is wrong with you? - So I had two options: I could just walk away and never talk to 'em again and lose out on this multi-million-dollar, uh, commercial property, or just trust them and see what happens. MARK: These are predators. Becki, she was addicted to the idea of being in love with this kid, and she was not gonna let go. ♪ GIANCARLO: One day, Becki texted me, "I was watching some video clips on my phone... Wow." At that moment, that just, like, set off an alarm. And that was the first time that I realized, "Oh, they were recording everything." I felt like it was a subtle hint as to, you know, "We got the goods on you too. Like, don't forget that." MARK: Jerry Falwell Jr., at the time, was everything that Giancarlo wanted to be. Giancarlo wanted all of this and they knew it. So they were using it as a method of control. "Hey, you know, have fun with your little girlfriend, but we own your ass." ♪ - You're fired. ♪ Money, money, money, money ♪ GIANCARLO: September 2012, Becki gives me a call saying, "Hey, do you wanna meet Donald Trump?" 'Cause at the time, he wasn't who he is today. He wasn't running for president. He was just the star on The Apprentice. They knew that I liked Donald Trump, that I read his book, The Art of the Deal. LILIA: My brother loved business and thought Donald Trump was great, and so he was like-- - Yeah, absolutely! MARK: They were bringing him into a world that he couldn't even imagine. "Real estate, politics, my future, everything is here." He had never in his life imagined being able to be allowed entrée into that world. GIANCARLO: I paid for the ticket from Miami to Lynchburg, then they put me at a hotel. But after a day, they're like, "Hey, you don't need to stay there actually. Just come stay with us at our house." It was the first time that I met their kids. I don't think they suspected anything at the moment. Jerry and Becki did tell the kids they were helping me out, that they wanna give me the opportunity to rise within business. Jerry was the leader of this Christian university, so they're around young adults. It's actually pretty reasonable. No one really asked why I was around. I just kind of blended right in. I was kind of expecting this weird Bible college in the middle of nowhere, but Liberty University is one of the nicest campuses I've seen. Jerry was very proud, and he mentioned that the endowment was about two billion dollars. Coming from Miami where you have people from all parts of the world, it's a melting pot, but what I did notice at Liberty, there weren't many Black students. It was mostly white evangelicals. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Today, I want to say to the people of America and the nations of the world, we are not about to turn around. We are on the move now. Yes, we are on the move, and no wave of racism can stop us. [crowd clamoring] - March 1965 is a big turning point for many white evangelical pastors to understand that the world was changing. They would have to consider what side of that world that they wanted to be on. Would they be on the side of the Civil Rights Movement, or would they be on the side of white supremacy? And Jerry Falwell Sr. made a choice. JERRY SR.: I remember preaching a sermon justifying the segregationist position. One can make the Bible say almost anything he wants to make it say. - Our God is marching on. Glory hallelujah! Glory hallelujah! Glory hallelujah! - Jerry Falwell Sr. says that ministers should not be involved in the political, they should only be involved in preaching the Gospel of Jesus. But later on, his game had changed. REPORTER: School districts began desegregating today under Supreme Court orders. - Jerry Falwell Sr. was not happy about the Brown v. Board of Education decision. - But as the public schools reopen, a number of new private schools, all white, sprang into existence. - He started his own segregation academy there in conjunction with the Thomas Road Baptist Church. - These segregation academies were not called segregation academies. They had Christian names. But they were built to make sure that white children did not have to be in contact with African American children. - The IRS wants to revoke the tax exemptions for private schools which discriminate racially in their admissions policies. MATTHEW SUTTON: In the 1970s, the IRS determines that if you were a charitable institution by definition, so it means you get tax exemption, you cannot practice segregation. And one of the things they'd then target are these Christian-segregated academies. So this really wakes up Falwell and a number of other ministers, and they realize that if they don't have allies in the Federal Government, they're not gonna be able to keep doing what they're trying to do. JERRY JR.: I preached a few years ago that Christians shouldn't be involved in politics, but I think we have every right to speak. We're citizens too. - He actually at least had the integrity to acknowledge that he was a hypocrite. - Jerry Falwell Sr.'s idea about ministers being involved in politics was to support the status quo of white supremacy. - Falwell is really at the ground level doing this through his school, through his academy in Lynchburg, Virginia. ♪ - We're waiting in this back area. I'm with Becki and the kids.
