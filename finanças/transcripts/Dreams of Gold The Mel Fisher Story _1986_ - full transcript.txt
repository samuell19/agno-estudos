[announcer] in 1622, the Atocha, a Spanish ship, was lost at sea off the Florida Keys, carrying 260 people to their deaths. and with them, a legendary fortune in treasure. Over three centuries later, Mel Fisher led his family on a search for the Atocha. his dream of adventure, glory and gold would challenge the laws of this country. and change their lives forever. This is the story of that quest. You okay? - I'm okay. Please don't tell your mom. You okay, angel? - Yeah, Mel, I'm fine. If it was easy, everybody'd be doing it! Slack up on your train line. Okay, Don, make that line fast. Alright, I got it. - It's all yours, babe. Alright, folks! Today's the day! Come with me, folks! We're going up to the galleon. You're going to see authentic artifacts from authentic... [Kim] Dad! - Yeah, Kim? Galleon's sleeping again. Well, pull up on the diver! Pull it up! We can't have the tourists on The Titanic! Behind in our insurance! Way behind. Follow me, just follow me! We got gold, we got silver! We've got gold bars and silver bars! You can see 'em and you can touch 'em, But sorry, there are no samples. Step right up, folks! Now, one at a time! Here we go, genuine artifacts from genuine sunken ship. Right over here... No. Sir. Wait. No. Mad...Hey! No more promises, Fisher. - What? Today is the day. - What? Taking my compressors. - Oh, wait a minute. My divers need air. I need money and I have a contract. No, but I know, but wa... - Hi, honey. Aw, hello, babe. - Any luck, dad? How you doin'? Oh, it was a great day, Taffi. As usual, we didn't find anything. We're in debt and I'm outta air. What else can I say? [Taffi] Like any other day, right? Yeah, like any other day, but tomorrow's the day, babe. We're gonna find The Atocha. - Alright, dad. The big pile. The big pile. Let me borrow these for awhile, will ya? I'll give 'em back. Whatcha got there? - Oh, boy! Looky here! - What? A sweet man in South Bend, lookin' at all that snow and dreamin' about Florida and all the gold you're gonna find him. That's great! Alright, listen, make out a, uh, No, wait a minute. Kane! - Yeah, Dad? Go get that little squirt, he's got our air. Take this with you, go get him. Mr. Fisher. - Yes, sir? I read about you in L.A. Are you hirin'? Ah, you lookin' for a job? Well, I got my papers. Dived off Hawaii, Catalina. Yeah? Good. You play the guitar, too, huh? Uh-huh. - Can you play "Home On The Range"? Well, I've heard of it, but I play mostly Dylan, Beatles. That's alright. Listen, you can play back in the poop deck, for the customers. Uh, we don't pay much. Well, that's twice what I've been making. Where's the poop deck? [Deo] This way. Come here, I'm gonna show you. You play Dylan, really? - Well, yeah. So, that's Mel Fisher in person. We've read about him. Did he really find a fortune in gold? - That's a laugh. Those kids oh his were in grade school when he started. Claimin' he knows where that Spanish ship went down. Hell of a way to bring up kids. Divin' for their crazy old man, who's out sellin' stock in a company that's one step ahead of the sheriff. - Yeah, but what about the museum? He's found stuff, alright. Some gold and silver. But lots of junk, puts it in that floating museum and sells tickets. That's what feeds his wife and kids. But it's not enough to pay for his salvage operation. Calls himself a treasure hunter. I call him a cock-eyed dreamer. You'll read about him again. He'll either be rich or dead. Or back with his chickens in Indiana. Deep six'd, either way. Fisher, you're not outta this mess yet. What mess? [Taffi] What do you think it is, Dad? A giant B.B. It's a mini-mine. Watch out! It'll blow up! Where'd you get this, Taffi? Where we were diving yesterday. I didn't think it was anything. Well, you know those ships that had gold had soldiers. Soldiers had guns, this could be a musket ball from The Atocha. Really? - Hey, Dad, let's take it to the bank. Oh, yeah, what a marvelous idea. I can hear them now. "Well, it's mint condition, but tell me, Mr. Fisher, "I mean, divin' everyday, all you can find is musketballs?" Well, Mr. bank president, we got pieces of eight, we got silver... You should have heard the guy I met last week. "Hey! I know you're Mel Fisher's kid. "So tell me somethin'. You dive at night?" And you said, "Right"? - He said, "With lights?" - And you said, "No! With candles and a lot of matches!" What about that dude last year? Said I was disruptin' the fishes schedule. He was a little loose in the loafers. Yeah, all the fish were leaving his spot to come watch us, right? They just don't understand. Well, don't be too hard on 'em, Kim. They... think we're dreamin'. Some day, they'll wake up. Maybe we are just dreaming. Nine ships went down. This could be from any of them. Well, we just keep on lookin'. Meanwhile, your mother and I are going to walk off whatever it is we just ate. Come on, babe. - Hey, we won't be long. Okay. See, they're starting to bite already. Except for you, as usual. Bite me, and they die. Then why the hell did you have to say that about those other ships? 'Cause it's true. Aw, who cares? You guys are about as bad as everybody else in Key West. Look, Angel. - You are talking about your father, Kim. Guess it's just that we've been lookin' for so long. Hey, you guys. Let's not start talkin' like they do about him. So, what's it going to be? We gonna help him find that pile? Or do we just sit around and bitch? We bitch. Ah, look at that, look at that, Deo. Isn't that beautiful? Ah! Just think. 348 years and 10 months ago, The Atocha was right out there. Right out there in that storm. And the wind was blowin', the sails were rippin' apart. And people were cryin' and prayin' and it smashed to pieces right out there somewhere. Right-out-there. And I'll bet you a hot fudge sundae, tomorrow's the day. After 10 years, I'm gonna bet against Mel Fisher? I think you're... crazy to stick with him. I know, but in what other life could I wake up in the morning and think I might win The World Series, The Superbowl and the Indy 500, all in one day? Lady, the man cannot finance a can of beans. I'd dump him! - You're right. When you're right, you're right. I should go out and buy me a chicken farm. And then, just lie in bed at night, listening to my arteries harden. Oh, I love you, chicken. I love you, too, Mel. Kill it, Mo! - Okay, Mon. That's good. They're comin' up, Mo. Blew out a hole 10 feet deep! Those things look like mail boxes! You ought to see it down there! Well, the old boy has a good idea every once in awhile. Of course, it takes a couple of years but it sure beats doin' it by hand. How 'bout that, huh!? - Yeah, how 'bout that? Good idea again, Dad. Yeah, it's a better idea than training those porpoises. Hey, you guys! What is it, Angel? Somthing wrong? - What is it? No, they're hu... Wait until you see what I got. Help me out here. Oh, you guys! The sand blew away! It was just lying there! [Mel] What? What is it, honey? Oh, I'm sorry, Angel. I'm sorry to disappoint you, babe. But that is not pure gold. What!? No, maybe 23 and a quarter carats. [Mel] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. Today is the day! It is found! Mr. Melvin Fisher? Are you Melvin A. Fisher? Doing business as "Treasure Salvors, Incorporated"? I was when I got up, Luther. How long you know me? How long have you know this was coming, Mel? You signed a contract to give the state 25% of everything you find. I never thought I'd see the day. Mr. Fisher, as you know, the Florida State Department of Reclaimation has a rule. Ah, therefore, I hereby inform you that, as of this day, your operations will be monitored by Agent Hudley, here. [Mel] Monitored? Dr. Livingston, I presume. Did he say, "Hudley"? He's a dudley. [Luther] He will be on board when you're at sea. You will provide proper accomodations. And when you dock at night, he will inventory your findings. Look who signed it. Is that what you call a spy? Who got to him, Luther? - Beats me. Agent Hudley is now part of your crew. - Yeah!? Yeah, well, what if my captain says "no", I say "no" and he doesn't put his foot on that boat. What happens? Then you don't sail. - Uh-huh. Stand by to cast off, boys. Mel, do you really want to fight The Marine Patrol? You really wanna go to war with me, Luther? Hey, Luther! Why don't you call the *Coast Guard*!? Dad, the tourists! - Better yet, The Navy! Agent Hudley, get aboard and carry out your orders. Yes, sir, Mr. Banks. - Hey, Luther! Call The Marines, huh!? Cast off, cast off! You saw it, folks! The bureaucrats! We do the work! And they take it! No gains and I don't get seasick. Wait'll you try my cookin', pal!

The usual, when he gets enough money to keep us afloat. Someday, he's going to end up in Alaska. Taff, can I have a serving? Honey, that's not a half plate. Yes, it is. I know this is so. Eat, drink and be merry. For tomorrow, we die. Well, that was bad. - So, do you do this often? [Taffi] Only when we wanna eat. No, just when, uh, Mel and Deo run out of funds to pay the troops. Thank you. - You guys, you know this is the 156th Hard Times Party. - Is it, really? Yeah. - Didn't know you were countin', sweetheart Hey! They again, it could be a lot of fun. Penny, did I ever tell you about that time I got in this little skiff and I saw these two big fins right behind one another, did I tell you about that? Two fins? You mean sharks? - Well, yeah, no, that's what I thought. What I thought they were were sharks,... That happened to Don. - Mmmm, now don't be mean. He's probably just jealous of you two old married folk. Anyway, it's a wonderful story. Bye! - Have fun. You guys see what I see? Why, it's Dudley. Looks like John Wayne to me. John Wayne? Look more like Gabby Hayes to me. Yoo-hoo! Agent Hudley! Yes, ma'am. Come on over here and join us. Uh, thank you, ma'am, but I'm fine. There's more than plenty. But I didn't chip in. You're our guest. - Mom! He's on their side. - He's just trying to do his job, with a wife and family. Come on, you hungry? - Yes, ma'am. This is the place. - I'm always hungry. Mmmm, seconds, Taffi? - Sure, Penny. Hey, Dudley. - Hi. It's my first "Hard Times" party, too. - Yeah? Enjoy. - Thank you. Uh, is that there chili or fish? No, it's um, both. Deo, I think 'cause he been posted here, he can have a beer. - Yeah! Absolutely. Don't mind if I do. Whoa! If we run low, we just throw in a box of oatmeal to swell it up some more. Giving away all our secrets. Okay, come on. Sit right over here, come on. - Much obliged, Miss Taffi. ♪ The skies are not cloudy all day Understand your uh, husband's on another trip. Yeah, tryin' to scare up a few more investors. Hmmm. Well, he sure spent a lot on this, huh? All we have, and then some. And then some more. Uh, Mi-Miss Fisher, uh, I sat on board, checking out all the things he's found so far, and I'm here to tell ya. You don't think we're going to find it, do ya? Sorry, but I think it's worse than that. Give me my chili back! But I-I didn't even have it. I'm just kiddin' ya. Oh, we haven't found much, but we haven't lost our sense of humor. Yeah. Or our faith. Cheers to that. - From what you've told me about your father, he sounds fasinating. He's raised chickens. - Yeah. Then one morning, he said he was tired of hearing eggs plopping in the nests. So, he opened a dive shop in California. You know, Don told me your mother held the underwater endurance record. More than 55 hours. Best in the world. Then he heard about this treasure off Florida, piled us in a car and... pffffft. You know how many times he got lost trying to get here? I couldn't even tell ya. You know, everybody's got a dream. But he's doing something about it. Pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. That's what everybody thinks, Penny. But they're wrong. It's not the gold. It's lookin' for it. Yes, ma'am, would you tell Mr. Carmody that, uh, 3 o'clock will be just fine with me and I, and I sure do appreciate it. Alright, thank you very much. Bye-bye. So, I only have a few minutes to give you, but, uh, I have a board meeting. - Ah, that's alright, Mr. Carmody. I got a meeting myself. I just want to check your lines to assure you. you have enough outlets, yeah. - One? Well, we're expecting a call from my divers in Key West in any minute. About the Atocha? - Yeah, that's the one. The big one. Oh, the other don't really count. I mean, The Atocha was really the crown jewel to the King of Spain, That's the one we're lookin' for. And you're expecting to find it in any minute? Yep, my divers do, and, uh, I do, too, just as sure as I'm sittin' here, holdin' this. You might be amused by this. It's, uh, a gold doubloon. Wanna try it on? Wha? - Yeah, kinda heavy there. Yeah, it's... Yeah, it's nice. Well, as I mentioned to you on the telephone, all we need is one other old boat. I mean, eventually we'll need a crane. But right now, just another old boat. I've had some research done, Mr. Fisher. Right after that hurricane, The Spanish attempted to salvage The Atocha. But some Dutch warships showed up and drove them off. Now, uh, how do I know those Dutchmen didn't pick its' bones clean? Well, The Dutchmen didn't find that, now did they? Huh? Oh, it's a nice act, Mr. Fisher. Mmmm, nice act. Easy goin'. Low key. I reckon at the next stop, you'll probably do a fast song and dance? No, no, I...Actually, I don't even know what I'm doin' here right now. You're here because I am worth 50 million dollars. Well, that's nice, Mr. Carmody, but uh, The Atocha's got you beat. It's got about 350 million more. I happen to know the state has an agent on board your boat. Now, uh, wouldn't be too smart of me to invest in something that might be tied up in the courts for years and years, would it? Well, it all depends on your point of view. I mean, some people consider that part of the suspense. You mentioned, uh, a boat with a crane? Yeah, eventually. I mean, uh, we're talking about 50 tons of gold and silver. Not to mention the thousands of emeralds down there. You, uh, you find any more of these? - Sir? I say, did you find any more of these? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got, uh, plenty of those. Let's see, I got some in my pocket right here. Saw some around here the other day. Let's see. Yeah, here's some. Oh, darnit. Clumsy. I'm sorry. Spilled them all over your floor there. Oh, that's alright. We'll pick these up. Is that...real gold? - Yeah, that's gold, alright. That's it, yep. And that's real silver? - Yeah, that's silver. Pieces of 8, yeah. - What's that? That's not. It's just a nickel. - Oh, oh. You look over there, you might have something over there. Oh, yes. So, it is. That's a gold piece. Yeah, that's another gold. There you go. - Thank you. Well, - Here's a silver one, too. Ah, keep that. Don't even know where it came from. Just a piece of 8. [woman on phone] Board meeting, Mr. Carmody. Tell them to wait. Historical value, too. Hmm-mmm. Museums, yeah. Tax benefits. Well, I don't want to take up any more of your time, Mr. Carmody. Sure appreciate you giving me this time. I've got a meeting, too. I've got to meet some good ol' boys in Palm Beach. Dallas, places like that. I can, uh, reach you in Key West? Oh, yeah. Yeah. We, uh, we never close. Darn. I almost forgot. - Beg pardon? My paper. - Oh. I don't want to forget that. I mean, there's plenty where that comes from. But, thanks again, Mr. Carmody. I was going to name it after our backers, but I didn't have enough paint. Didn't have enough paint for Carmody, Smith, Jones, Willingham, Schwartz, Axleman and... Berman. Which one did you use this time, honey? The old "gold detector that never fails" one? No, I used the old "coins on the carpet" routine. Hey, Dirk. - Yeah. I want to talk to you, young man. Got a little somethin' for ya. What's this "Captain Dirk Fisher"? Did I spell it wrong? Thanks, Dad. It's okay. Just don't, uh, start dishin' out marriage licenses all through Key West, okay? I want you to have that, Pop. Thanks, Skipper. Captain Dirk Fisher! Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray! Alright, man, I can't wait until Mel and Deo see this. Can you believe it? Mel's gonna count those links. Hey, hey, wait a minute, Dudley. Not until Mel and Deo get back from the hearing. Let me see that. That is The Atocha, alright. But how can you tell, Mo? Look. Every link, the same size. Take off a link, use it for money. Somebody was wearing it the night the storm hit. Wind howling, waves crashing over the deck. And this person in the water tryin' to swim. You people give me the creeps. It is only the truth. Rich somebody, thinking they important. Could own gold. But the sea took it away. And now, we took it back. But this won't be the end of it. Mr. Fisher, you say you invented this so-called "mailbox" to speed up your search for treasure. Do you have a patent for this invention? No sir, I... Uh, I'm not in the manufacturing business and I just never got around to getting it patented. The result, other treasure hunters have copied your device, and our ocean floor now looks like a battle field. Oh, no, sir, the tides and the currents smooth it out pretty good. Mr. Fisher, you you must be aware of the archeological value of The Atocha? Yes, sir. I, uh, I have great respect for the historical value of The Atocha. Doesn't look like it to me. You see, this wreck, as well as others, is a priceless heritage belonging to the field of archeology. Let's not make too fine a point of this. You are a treasure hunter. Out for profit. Need I remind you of what happened to The San José? Oh, sir. No, I have never, nor would I ever, use dynamite. I mean, that's strictly for amateurs. That's what you say now. But the fact is, you're gouging craters out there. Bigger boats. Newer devices. In your lust for gold, you've mounted a full-scale attack on our heritage. It's not yours, Mr. Fisher. It belongs to the people of Florida. Yes, sir. Gentlemen, I... I respect our heritage. and our environment, and and the people. I mean, uh, A lot of folks have been looking for The Atocha for 350 years. Including some of our finest scientists. And I, I respect all of them. And I sympathize with them for givin' up, because it's a damn hard and dangerous job. Now, uh, A lot of folks would just call us a bunch of raggedy, uh, Just a bunch of raggedy dreamers. And they'll say The Atocha is not there and that it's some kind of ghost ship. Well, we don't-we don't believe in ghosts. We believe in The Atocha, my wife and I. Our kids and the kids that work with us. We believe she's out there. And we don't care what you call us. You can call us anything you want, because in America, I grew up thinkin' dreamin' was okay. I mean, That's what makes America special. Different. I mean, that's really what America is when you think about it. It's kinda,... a dream that's grown up. Realize. Fulfill. I think everybody in our country should have that right, to go for that dream. I mean, all they have to do is, uh, is believe in it and go for it. And that's a right that is *for* the people. Gentlemen, we don't want to fight you. We don't want to fight the State of Florida. We don't want to fight the government. We don't want to fight anybody. All we want is the right to go for that dream. And if that's taken away from us, well, we think that's unconstitutional and unfair. If-if-if you take that away from us, we're in deep water. We will have lost a lot of years and a lot of folks' money and America will have lost. Somethin' she's had since 1776. America will've lost more. More than us. C'mon, Deo. We're not finished. Neither are we. Mathewson? Mathewson. Mr. Mathe... Mr. Mathewson. My name is Mel Fisher. I'm a, I'm a treasure salvor out of Key West. Well, Mr. Fisher, heard a lot about you. - Yeah. You probably heard about all the trouble that I had, right? Yeah, from what I understand, you've had more than your share. Oh, I have. I've been in and out of court so much, I can't even remember this last year. I mean, it's been a nightmare. And all I'm tryin' to... and all I'm tryin' to do is to protect my rights, know what I'm sayin'? I mean, I thought maybe, maybe you could help me. Me? - Yeah. I'm an archeologist. Sometimes an anthropologist. But never a lawyer. - Oh, no. I go...I've had more lawyers than I need right now. Well, what do you want with me? - I need to be able to identify everything I find. I mean, if I find one rusty nail, I want to be able to tell, what town in Spain it came from. I've got a pal over there, Gene Lyons. He's combin' all the maritime history. He's great, but he's over there and you're over here. [Mel] See, I, I need you to help train the kids. And me, in underwater archeology. You could help us find the motherlode, because I know The Atocha's down there. I just know it. I know it! Now, according to the Spanish records, the 1622 hurricane came from, uh, a Southeast direction, along this line, right Right. And we've done covered every inch along that trail. Yep. Yep, found the doubloon here. Necklace here, shards here. Timber here, and the silver 25 feet down. 5 to 10 feet of sand, and then then solid mud. Gold. The weight of it. Over three centuries. Workin' it's way down through the sand, and through that mud. Then all the way through that, to bedrock. Yep. Gold had centuries. I don't have that much time. [woman] Those "The Day's The Day" t-shirts are really starting to break my heart. [man] Well, if we didn't wear 'em, then it'd break his heart. You know he's in there making peanut butter sandwiches again, pretending they're ham and cheese. You guys know how long ago I left college? What's that supposed to mean? I could've had my masters degree by now. Well, you don't appreciate what I've brought ya? Such a wise guy. - Ho, that's enough. That's enough. Stick with me, kid and you'll get your masters in "shipwreck". Ooh, yeah. You know this trail's drying out, right? I mean, we haven't found anything for weeks. Ah, I don't know. I think The Atocha just doesn't want to be found. Maybe Mo's right. There's some kind of curse on it. Deo, I think the crew wants to quit. Even Mo and Don. [Deo] What'd they say? They say something? No. I just have a feeling. I can't blame 'em. I mean, they've been livin' off of fresh fish and stale dreams for so long, I can't expect them to give up the best years of their life for my crazy, hair-brained idea. - It is not. There's gold down there and you're going to find it. You and I are going to be on deck in our wheelchairs, looking at our grandchildren dive for it. What's the matter with you? I've never seen you like this. The trouble with me is I-just-never-grew-up This... child-like dream of buried treasure. I was thinkin' the other day, maybe, um, callin' a family meeting and, uh, putting it up to a democratic vote. Whaddya think? No-no-no. If we had wanted a democracy, we wouldn't have had so many kids. Who do you think you're having dinner with, Mel Fisher? This is the same girl who broke the underwater endurance record. I'd still be down there if I hadn't gotten pregnant with Taffi. Nobody's going to make me quit again. Especially not you. 'kay? Okay. We'll give it a hundred days and if we don't hit it by then, we'll pay everybody off and go climb Mt. Everest. Is that a deal? You got a deal. Stop it! Just stop it! Put that down right there. You can't do this! You can't do this! - Deo. That won't help your case one little bit. Here, I'm treating it the way the government is treating our contract! You're not giving us back our 75%! [Luther] Now, Deo. I wouldn't do this if I were you! Luther! Luther, you should be ashamed of yourself! You're taking everything we've ever found! Whaddya doing?! Where you going!? Alright, now, before I listen, I got one question. What's that? - Why me? Why you? 'Cause you're young and cheap. Ahhh, I hope. I mean, those other lawyers are going to charge me $20,000 up front just to research this project with this new twist. You wouldn't charge me that, would ya? Well, no I wouldn't, but I do like to get paid. [Mel] Ah, don't worry about it. Well, I understand your other attorneys had to. Well, they got a little tired gamblin' on me, ya know. It takes nerve to stay in this business. Well, I can believe that. - So, how much? Um, 50 an hour? 50 an hour's a deal. So, you started at, uh, 2:30, so, uh, the clock...is.... running. And counting. Jimmy! Another round. Uh, no thanks. Not for me. I, uh, I got to understand what it is you're talkin' about. So? - So, uh, If I wanted to dive for The Atocha, I had to make a deal with the state. If I wanted to get a license, or I wanted to keep *some* of what I got, I had to agree to the Florida territory extended all the way to Spain, or... Come on! You're diving outside the 3 mile limit! I mean, even that's a joke! A law based on how far a shore gun can fire a cannonball in 1587. Is that right? - Yes, sir. I'll be damned. Wait a minute. Admirilty law also makes it possible for the federal courts to take jurisdiction over a shipwreck. Jurisdiction? You mean they could... take it out of the state? Yep, and now the only problem is there has to be absolutely no question that the shipwreck is The Atocha. Now, if you can do that, I have an idea where we might put the blocks to 'em. Dave, I only got a $5. I'll give you the rest in shares, okay? Shares? - Yeah, gets ya on the board. When we hit it, you'll be a rich man. I like the way you talk. Yeah, you do? Well, you talk pretty good yourself, Mel. No more hundred day deadlines. How 'bout that, Angel? I'll buy that. Okay, man, listen. You know what's going to happen now? - Yeah, I know. I'll get on the radio. Dad'll come up with some idea. Now, you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. The dolphin crest is right on top of the cannon. Are *you* sure? - Well, it scares the hell outta me, but it's the only way we're gonna get it out of the state's jurisdiction and get you your day in court. - Well, that's what I want is another day in court. But what I'm worried about is if we ace Florida out, we'd bring the federal government in. I told you it scared me. They're coming in early today. Permission to come aboard, Captain? Permission granted, Mr. Banks. No luck again, I see. We'll hit it someday. Yeah. That's your dad's favorite saying, isn't it? "Today's The Day". Yeah. Looks like, uh, spring housecleaning. It's getting pretty rank, sir. I swear, Hudley, you're beginning to *look* like these people. Thank you, sir. Very unsanitary. You hit it! You hit it! And you thought you'd hide it. No, that's just to keep it from rusting. Okay, a couple of you guys get a truck! We'll get this on the road to Tallahassee. [Mel] Alright, come on. Right this way, fellas. Excuse me, people, excuse me. Oh, Deo, sweetheart, I want you to see this, come here. It's alright. Go get 'em, Tiger. This is Mr. Drummond, a federal marshall. What is this?! - Admiral's Law, Mr. Banks. As part of The Atocha, that cannon's the same as the whole ship itself. You're lookin' at a warrant. That cannon is the property of the State of Florida! No, no. It's the property of the finder. And is under protective custody of the federal courts pending my client's charges against The Atocha, commanded by Admiral Pedro De Esperza. The captain of The Atocha?! He's been dead for 350 years! That's his problem! - Do your duty, Marshall. You are going to arrest a cannon? I guess I have to. Unless you want 50 witnesses watch you defy a court order. Warrant for arrest and rim. The President of the United States of America to the marshall of the United States for the Southern District of Florida. Greeting. Whereas, on the 18th da... Can I just say this? You want the whole 9 yards? Cannon. In the name of the United States government, I hereby arrest you in the matter of Fisher versus nuestra senora de Atocha. Alright, Mel. Well, forget it, pal! Forget it! Take it easy, mon! Mel, he's not the only place in town. Hey, what's wrong? Ah, that barracuda. He's tryin' to charge me three times as much for air. He smells money, he thinks. I mean, imagine selling air to people? What kind of world is this? - Yeah, ain't that awful, huh? Mel, now don't misunderstand. I still got my job with the state. Seniority and all. - Yeah. And they'll just re-assign me, but... I talked it over with the wife. And I wanna go to work for ya. For good!? - For better or worse. Now, I know it might take more years to hit it, and God knows I know how you pay. But, I guess I've gotten to like y'all. Well, I guess it's mutual. Welcome to poverty! I hope you like chili and peanut butter, Hudley Thanks, Mel, but let's just keep it at Dudley, huh? Alright, Dudley. Now you're on our side of the law. Sooner or later, mon, gold will getcha. Yeah, okay, thanks, Mo. You sure you know what you're doin' now, Dudley? Oh, I'm sure, Mel. Well, Excuse me. We've found 6 cannons already, but, uh, trail's gotten a little dry lately. Yah, but don't have to find all the cannons. You know, I don't understand. There were 20 solid bronze, 300 pound cannons. They should have pretty much gone straight down. Now, you'd think that... 50 tons of gold and silver would have done the same thing, wouldn't ya? Yeah, there's something funny about how that ship went down. Yeah, soldiers, where's their armor and helmets? Where'd they all go? Down in the dark with de gold. gurgling> So, what did you think of those two sharks you saw Sunday? Those weren't sharks. Those were jellyfish. No. - Yes, they were big jellyfish. I won't understand if I live to be a hundred. What is that, Dudley? How you people get so much done being so disorganized! Dudley, organization is boring. Ho-ho-ho, will you look at you! Will you look at you? Jerk! Hey. Some sexy color. You like it? - Hmm-mmm Well, I tell you somethin'. You ain't seen nothin', yet. Yo, Don, what's this? You're late. No, look at this. I just wanted to take one more dive. Look what I found. Whatever it is. Scone. It's a gold knife. A Whistle. [Hudley] A Whistle? A bosun's whistle. You done found it. command> It's not like any bosun's whistle I've ever heard. Maybe. Maybe The Atocha. [Kane] Blow it again. [Mel] Happy birthday, Angel! Dad! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Well, we couldn't celebrate New Year's, so we're celebrating birthdays! Happy birthday, sweetheart. Thank you, I love you. I love you, darlin'. I think you're running out of oxygen, but I love you. Mr. Barrister, would you pass that around. Does anybody here realize that life is great?! [all] Yeah! You havin' any fun? [all] Yeah! Okay, okay. Floor show's over. Honey, have we got a surprise for you. - What? Fried chicken! [Mel] Alright! [Mel] Alright! What is it? - A box. [Mel] That's a box! There's nothing in it. [Mel] A pizza! I'm gonna find out what it is. Just right now. Pizza!? Oh! - [Mel] Alright! You better hang on! You better get some of this chicken, kid! Come on! Come on now! Here ya go! [Hudley] Here ya go! Hey, you! Hello! [Hudley] Here ya go! The wind howling. And he was blowing as loud as he could. Trying to warn dem. But they couldn't hear. Well, there's nothing they could have done about it. It gave me the chills when you blew it. No, no, Mel. For the museum. People will love it. That's nice, Tom. Well, Taffi will stay with me and, uh, Deo. See that everyone gets on the right boats. - Yah. Dirk, he want to head out tonight, meet to the site in the morning. Virgil is only getting old. I'm gonna anchor close to shore. Suit yourself. Well, Goonight. - Night. It's a good omen. Tomorrow's the day. Goodnight, Mo. I'll head out with Dirk. Thank you, Dirk. It looks beautiful on you. Happy birthday, m'darling. Get out! Get out! Get out, Dirk, Angel! Everybody, get out! Get out! Get out! Get out, Dirk! Get out, everybody! Hang on, Donny! Hang on! Hang on! Help! Somebody! Help me out! Help me! Can't see! I can't see! Grab me! - My eyes! My eyes are full of diesel fuel! [Hudley] Four people are still down there! You alright? I can't see! - He's got diesel fuel in his eyes! Alright! Stay there! Stay there! Kane, stay there! What happened?! I don't know. I don't know. I just, uh, I just went out, the weight shifted, and, and it went over like that. Who else? Who else!? - I don't know. I guess everybody but us. We gotta get 'em! We gotta get 'em! Settle down! Settle down! Hang on, now. Hang on, now! Listen to me. Listen to me! Are you listening to me!? - Yes. Listen. We've got no gear and no lights. You go back down in there now, it'll be pitch black. You'll have to swim down... Listening! You'll have to go down the corridor and have to go up. You'll never find them. They're going to be alright. Man, we're gonna sink, too! Hang on, you hear me! NO! I'm going down there! - Man, what the hell... NO! Gage is down there, too! I've got to go get him! Crazy boy! Listen to me! Slow down! I'm senior here! Everybody! You'll obey my orders! Listen to me, it's going to be light in a couple of hours. Mo'll pick us up. We're going to be alright. A light! There's a light! Is that you, Don!? I can't see! Hang on, hang on. Just give me your hand. Up you go, easy, easy now. Who's that? What about Dirk? Angel? Rick? It's goin'. It's goin'! Easy now. Easy. Don't tip it up. Angel! Hey, you two. You watch out for him, you hear me? Mo? I didn't want to ask before. But did they say what happened? Just went down, girl. And if we knew what happened, would it bring them back? Probably thought they were... Probably thought they were just dreamin'. [Deo] My babies, Mel. They weren't just babies. Ma? Come on. You haven't been out in a long time. I told you I'm not going diving. I'm never going to dive again. Mel? A mon can quit and say, "I won't pay the price". But you, old friend, have paid. Much too much. Now, it owes you. Ah. [Dave] I'm an idiot, right? I knew kickin' it up to federal court would open a can of worms. Hey, Dave. You won. And the state appealed. And you won again. Gentlemen, in Florida's mind, I'm a shyster and Mel's a pirate. I've convinced federal courts to take away treasure the state feels is theirs. Now, Florida does not like this. In fact, they hate it. They hate it so much, they are taking Mel to the end of the line, to the highest court in our land. And would you like to know how many times The Supreme Court has ruled against state governments? Not really. I think we need another round. After a tragedy like this, they still keep hounding the man. He and Deo have damn near give up. The law never does. It could take years to reach a decision, right? Maybe not. The longer the laws are vague, the stickier it gets. They'll want to close this one. Dave, when you were in school, did you think you'd be arguing a case before The Surpreme Court? Yeah, but in my daydreams, I always imagined a case I couldn't lose. [Hudley] Hi, Mel. Hey, Dudley. How you doin'? Alright. Buy you a Coubra Libre? Well, I'll sit with ya. How's it goin'? Not bad. No news yet, huh? No, no. Those judges are still tryin' to make up their mind. Yeah, well. I'll say this. Ol' Dave gave it his best shot, though. He stood right up there and gave them that whole constitutional bit. Mel? I hope you don't think I'm outta line, but but everybody in town can see it. See what? Well, ever since The Northwind went down, you've just been kinda fakin' it. Just goin' through the motions. Sendin' us out everyday to dive, not even botherin' to go out with us. You guys don't need me, you know that. More than ever now. Why? What's happenin' isn't about... treasure huntin', anymore Mel. The little guys who say, "You think I'm crazy, "but I can do it. I can have a dream." "And I can go for it, and maybe hit the jackpot." "And when I do, Big Brother isn't there to take it away." Mel. It's for us. For me. And all the other people who believe. ♪ A story of a schooner ♪ It raced and never failed ♪ And built in Nova Scotia ♪ Designed for wind and sea ♪ The story of a monumental dream that came to me ♪ Christened her in... Over here is what we call our "Jam Section" It's two pieces of white bread jammed together. Kind of a jam session, huh? - You spared no expense. Oh, no, no, honey. We don't *spend* no expense. You mean, *spread* no expense. - Over here is the "Chili Department". Your little baby cookin' our chili. Famous all the way down Duval Street. Terrific, terrific. Mel, I'm amazed you've never been to one of these. I am, too. I keep bustin' my hump, tryin' to raise money, and they keep catered affairs, for heaven's sake. You hear anything yet? - Nope. Nope. The Supreme Court takes its' supreme time, I guess. Mel, maybe no news is good news. Yeah, ya know? No, babe. No news is no news. I'm worried. Don't be. You've won in court over a hundred times. I wonder. What? Do chicken farmers... have to go to The Supreme Court? Ever? Remember in ancient times, when he brought bad news, they used to kill the messenger? Hey. You're not gonna have to kill me. We won! What's goin' on?! [Mel] Kim! Kim! We won! We won! Yeah! - Go on, baby. They believed our dream. We won. I wish Dirk and Angel were here. They are, babe. They are. - "As grave as the perils of the sea are, and where the gravest peril came, "Not from the sea, but from 2 unlikely sources.

Well, sure, but first you got to find the gold! Ah, the gang's all here, huh? Except Mel and Mo. Look, I just saw, I just saw Mo. He's on the way to the Coast Guard station. And Mel? I dunno. Don't worry about it. Mel's the original "Hurricane Harry". He'll be alright. Hey, wet t-shirt contest... - Shhh! Hi, Deo and Taffi! Nice and dry! Have you seen Mel? Nobody's seen him. I done seen him half hour ago. Thought he'd be here by now. He didn't say where he was going? Come to tink of it, yes. Something about sailing to Tahiti. giving warning on air> Keep smiling for Deo. I don't know what he knows. All of a sudden he left me. Said he'd meet me here. Then he smile. A smile like I'd never seen before. Threw both his hands up in the wind and the rain and said, "Isn't this beautiful weather?" [Mel] Okay, now, Oh, Mel, thank God. - Where you've been? Clear the decks! Clear the table! Where you been?! - Clear it off. Nevermind. I'll tell ya in a minute. Now, clear it off, get it off. Unroll the chart. - Mel, what are you doin' now? [Mel] Deo, Deo, just cool it a minute, now. Everybody open up the chart. There we go. Don't rip it. Now, wait a minute. Easy now. Alright, now, okay, now. Deo, Deo. You're a doubloon. Kane, you are a necklace. [Kane] I'm a necklace! [Mel] Now, necklace, now. Now Don, you are the - I'm the bosun's whistle, right? You're the... - I got it, I got it. Right, you got the cue covered there, right. I am the storm. You guys are the rocks! The rocks, okay? The rocks? - The reef, the reef, the reef. I'm the storm. Honey, you forgot the cannon. Can I be the cannon? - [Mel] You got the cannon. Alright. I'm the cannon. Now, here is The Atocha. Okay, I'm the hurricane. Giant hurricane. Blowing The Atocha Right all the way. Right...now. The skipper's no fool, right? He's not gonna turn around and go back to Havana. Why? He'll broadside, right? So he keeps on going, right? Running afront of the storm. Only smart way to go, man. What about the reefs? - [Mel] The reefs The reefs are just waiting for him. The reefs are just waiting for him, that's right. He should have known better than that. - [Mel] That's right. Known what? - Known?! That it was a hurricane. Not a little storm, honey. Not like what we got out here. A major hurricane. - Yeah, but this captain's not a swab jockey. This guy's an admirial. No matter, the man, sank, the ship sank on the rocks. And we found the doubloon The doubloon? We find the doubloon right here. Right, and the necklace was right there. [Mel] That's right. - Okay and the bosun's whistle There's the cannon right here. [Mel] The cannon right there, right. Everyting along a Northwest trail. Exactly where we've been looking. We've been right all along. Exactly, now the Spanish knew where it was, they came back to salvage it. and nothing there, right? Miles, nothing. Yeah, well, where'd it go, Mel? That's the question. This afternoon, I'm sittin' the charthouse and then it suddenly occurred to me. We hadn't checked the weather. It could've been and should've been and probably was another hurricane! Hurricane came along, knocked the bottom part of the ship off, It went all the way down... there. Down there! Well, darling, we searched every inch of that place. We never found it. Oh, no, sweetheart. Not far enough. It's another 1/2 mile down. I'm talkin' silver and gold and emeralds, you name it! It's all down there! Mel, Mel, Mel. Tons of gold, deep frogging all that way? You said yourself, the sea has mysterious ways, right? It could have leapfrogged down there. It's only 1/2 a mile down there. One more time, okay? [Mel] We can't quit now. Not now. Mel, you're a very lucky man. And if we quit now, we got to get real jobs. [Deo] You know what today is, don't you? [Mel] There's not a day I don't think about Dirk and Angel. I know we all do. And we owe it to them to keep on going. I know it's naive and I know it's impractical, I've never been accused of being practical, but I don't want to lose what we've had. Ever. Ever. I don't want to lose that, Deo. I mean, there are people that don't have that, they're rich people. They don't have that. And I want to take that that old galleon and turn it into a permanent museum. I mean, I want people to come from all around the world and see this and feel history and touch it. I mean, we're talkin' 6 years. 6 years after Shakespeare died. We've come a long way from Indiana, Mel. Long time ago. And I learned a little about diving, too, didn't I? And about inventin' things. And goin' broke. Hey, how... What is it? - What? Mom, Dad. - What's wrong? Yeah, what is it? - We've been lookin' all over for ya. Just come with us. It's okay, Mom. Please? Please? Wha-what's, what's going on here, huh? Here we are! Today's the day! Let's... Let's dive, Deo. Let's change and dive. I don't know if I can. You can. You can, Deo. They're all with us. All of 'em. You can do it, babe. - 'kay. Everyone! Hurray! On July 20th, 1985, after 16 years of searching, Mel Fisher found the Atocha's mother lode. The treasure, considered to be one of history's greatest marine archeological discoveries, is valued at over 400 million dollars. It now belongs to Mel Fisher and those who believed in his dream.
