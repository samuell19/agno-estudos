[ambient music playing] [Michael echoing] When you plunge into the abyss... you have the illusion of flight. - [gunshot] - [scream] [alarm clock beeping] [Michael] Friday, ten p.m., people spend the night in the casino, and that means I have a lot of work tonight. It's been three months since I started working in this casino. Everything is serious here. Surveillance cameras everywhere. The guards, they're former Marines, but I know everyone. Hey, Luigi, how's the wife? And everyone knows me. You could say we're like one big happy family. Ritchie is croupier on blackjack. He has a bad back. So I help him set up the shuffle machines. Ah, Diana, croupier at the craps table. She's my main problem because everyone knows that I'm in love with her. Do you know what my mama told me? If a woman is ignoring you... she probably likes you. I'm going to take your... silence as a maybe. [Michael] But it seems like she's not ready for a serious relationship. They didn't send you a guest card? [Michael] Mr. Gold, a very demanding client. But I've learned all his idiosyncrasies, and I'm always the one that serves him. Sometimes I hear something I shouldn't hear, but I'm not a loud mouth, and I keep these things to myself. So in general, everything is fine, but there is one thing. In reality, my name is Michael, and I'm a con artist. Ritchie's bad back hurt him, but helped me. Otherwise, who would have let me get to the shuffle machines? A con. It's also a game. I've been preparing for this moment for three months. Step one, fireworks. [inaudible] [beeps] May I? Step two. Miracle craps. Diana thought I went up to the craps tables to admire her, but I love money more, much more. Boom! Congratulations, sir. [cash register ring] You do smile after all, don't you? Step three, VIP card. [Michael] During the time that I've been serving Mr. Gold, I had a lot of ideas about what to do with him, but I'm not a sadist. After the chaos that I arranged, the playing cards will be replaced in the whole casino. We've had a few technical difficulties. Please, go to the VIP hall. [Michael] And while the guards are figuring out what happened, the most high-income players will be invited to the VIP hall. That's what I need. You might say these tricks are a hundred years old, and the cards are already looking for a con artist. You'd be right, but this is only one part of my plan. Step four. Elevator. Where's the VIP hall? This is a service elevator, sir. Oh, really? [chuckles] How am I supposed to know which elevators are the service ones and which ones are not? It's just a misunderstanding. Don't worry, sir. - I'll take you back upstairs. - Yeah, you better do that. Okay, what's going on? Sir, please be patient. - Don't calm me down. - We have a... - Are we stuck? - ...on the third floor. - Oh my God! - Maintenance, do you copy? - This is unbelievable! - Please calm down. - Please calm down. - God! - No, I... - Calm down! You see? - Goddamn it! - Everything's fine? [elevator beep] - The VIP hall is... - Yeah, yeah. I know. You incapable moron. The real fraud begins just when everyone thinks it's over. Your card, please. Bingo. Everyone I need at the same table. This is a place for high stakes. Each chip is worth a small fortune, but thanks to Diana, I had enough for the initial bet. During my work here, I have studied my opponents closely. No one knows me, but they're like relatives to me. Step five. Modern technology. My God, this is... this is incredible! - I have a downed elevator. - I have flown 3,000 miles... just to get stuck in some damn elevator! - My God! This is-unbelievable! - Sir, please calm down. - Please calm down. - No! You calm down! [Michael] The main thing is not to win all the time. The opponent has to be sure that he has a good chance. Then, he'll bet even more. Quite a serious game I see. And here, I thought I could just have a bit of fun. Well, maybe you should reconsider. All in. All in. I've had it up to here with all the lies I get, from my father, my older brothers and now you! Maybe you want to give me some advice, too? If I may offer you a word of advice, when it doubt, go without. In my experience, especially when it lasts as long as yours has... If I'll need your advice, I'll ask you for it. Welcome. You should have listened to the advice of a wise man. Wait, what... What are you doing? This gentleman won. Don't let it get to you. It's only money. Bring it upstairs. Thank you, gentlemen. What did you do to me? Where's my money? Take it. Take all of it. Where's my money? What is this? No, no, no, no! No, no, not me! Him! No! You got the wrong guy! You got the wrong guy! No! No! I am the owner of this casino. My name is Victor. Where is the money? I don't know. Have you tried the bank? Listen, uh, I'm one of your VIP clients, and I was on a winning streak, and then some con artist swindled me out of my winnings! I don't know what half-assed operation you're running here! Oh God, you have a heavy hand. Listen, a con man took it all. He's the one you should be looking for. Not me. You have cost me a whole lot more than just five million. I've had to compensate the players for their losses. You're going to give me back all that money. You have one week. [laughing] What? A week? It took me three months to plan this. I mean, okay, okay, a week, I got it. Okay. Oh, it hardly needs saying, but if you try to hide, we'll find you. But you're a smart guy. You work that out for yourself. Hmm? Well, hello there. [gun clicks] What a lovely welcome. [chattering] [shouting] Michael? Hey, Michael! [laughs] - Hey, what's up? - Happy to see you again! What do you think you're doing? Don't you know who that man is? That is the best gambler in all known history. Ah, they don't make people like this anymore. [shouting] Ah, Michael, I thought I'd never see you again. You're supposed to be somewhere on an island. Leon... this symbol, what does it mean? Ah, ah... stay right here. Now tell me exactly what happened. I don't know. He changed the cards in my hand. He altered your visual perception. Uh... [smacks lips] Okay, uh, psychics, eh, shamans, uh, magicians, all right? Uh, in theory, they're all born with the ability to dive into their consciousness. You see, it's, it's, it's like a room where you're allowed to do any supernatural activity. So your conman, he has the ability to change things that other people see. Leon, why don't you just tell me how to find him. This is not a theory. It's more like a legend. We're all bound by a collective unconsciousness and all archetypes, myths, they all come from there. And people with this ability, they can step out of their consciousness and enter the collective unconsciousness. It's like an alternate universe, which opens up infinite possibilities and access to all of mankind's cumulative knowledge. [thunder] Now normal people can also get into the world of subconscious, but they can't get out of it without a special amulet, a kind of compass. [laughing] Come on, Leon. Y-You got to be kidding me. I-Is my five million over there also? In here, I've got everything about paranormal abilities and the people who have them. Look through it... in my office. Now, I got some business to do. Alex... how did everything go? Like usual. Here's your five million. The guy has enough problems already? Oh, yeah. He's got talent I have to admit. Anyways, what did he do? Thank you. I doubt he'll get out of this problem now. - You think? - Oh, I'm pretty sure. They say that a person's problems are only as big as his ability to solve them. This suitcase has a better quality leather. It's been a long time since I've seen a contraption like that. Half the world's looking for it. Do you really think you are the only person interested in such things? Well? Do you agree to teach me? It's wrong to be so greedy, Alex. I opened the world of scams for you. Do the same for me. Show me the world that you know. We've done a lot of work together, and if you don't come back, who am I going to work with? Oh, I will be safe with this, right? No. It's not enough. You need a partner, and it can't be me. Has to be somebody you can rely on, somebody you can trust, somebody who loves you. Do you have a person like that? I'm working on it. Are you sure you want to do this? [chuckles] As a child, I had a two-volume book by H.G. Wells. There's one story I have remembered my entire life about a door in the wall. It was the story of a boy, a lonely dreamer. One day he wandered out to a familiar street where he saw a green wall with a white door. He went through it and found himself in a magical place, in a wonderland. He was amazed by what he saw. He loved it there. Was he able to get back? Yeah. I guess... He goofed up, and, uh, found himself back at home. He was very lucky then. Maybe. But, uh, when I found out about your abilities... I realized there it is, my magic door. And what I had dreamed about as a child, and I am not bound to let my chance pass by, do you understand? Especially now that we have this. That's not enough. It will help you navigate through the subconscious but without a partner, you will never be able to get back. Then let's start small. [chanting] What the hell are you doing? I'm doing it for you. You never know when somebody might put a spell on you. Well? [blows] Did you find your con man? [yawning] No. No. Just a... Just a bunch of random freaks. Leon, are you sure this is all for real? You're insulting me right now. All those creatures were vetted. I've seen with my own eyes all these things, and some of them, some of these beautiful freaks, I've seen them on my own personally. Next thing you'll tell me they're regulars in your casino. - What? - Right. I'm such an idiot! Hey! What are you doing with my X files? [laughs] Okay. Here's what I think. Beating the house is doable, but it requires some time which I, which I don't have. I've only got a week. But what if I can swap the time for planning with the abilities this lot has? For example, it says here that this guy can make objects move on their own. So who's to say he can't make the dice move? Or, I don't know... the roulette ball. [Michael] Eric, [chuckles] a rich kid, the son of a well-known business man. [scoffs] Daddy wants him to keep the family business going, but Eric is a party boy. He's not planning on working. He's taken care of for the rest of his life. Ha, so you won't be able to pull him in with money. Want to keep the party going? Who are you? Well, you can think of me as your kind fairy godmother here to rescue you from the glass tower and to open up a world of adventures. Your talents will be highly regarded. My fairy godmother appears to have a hormonal problem. Well, you can either listen to my fairytale... or live out your father's bad joke. [Eric] Okay, that guy, his name is Tony. He can control electronic devices. So cams don't pick him up, huh? [Eric] He's... he's a bit of a coward. He only messes with small time stuff, making the meter run faster, changing the traffic lights. [siren blaring] Where to? Must be hard for a taxi driver to support his daughter through school. What do you want from me? What is the name of your ability? Is it bilocation? Cryptesthesia? You can control electronic devices from a distance, can't you? I don't know what you're talking about. Are you with the authorities? - I haven't done anything. - I'm not from the police. I have a proposal for you. She can read people's minds. Comes in handy when you play poker, doesn't it? Do you think she can implant desires in people's minds? For example, the desire to raise the stakes. Her name is Tamara. She works for intelligence agencies in this part of the world, but she's like 2000 years old. Do you really want to drag her into a casino? You'd need a hypnotist. [Leon] His name is Kevin, but he's crazy. He's got autism or something like that. His parents put him in the looney bin. The doctors earned money off him. Whoever he programs gets cured of depression. It's a business for the nut house. They won't let Kevin out for anything. He's 50. No. He's about 45. He just drinks too much. When he gets drunk, he beats his wife. It's not the first time he's come to see you. But each time he comes to see you, you plant the idea in his head that he shouldn't drink, but it doesn't last for too long, does it? Can you get him to play this game? Gambling is going to make him channel his energy in a different way. He's going to stop drinking. He's going to stop beating his wife, and everybody's going to be happy. Let's play? Less than six. More. [laughing] Kevin, come with me. Kevin, listen. We make a pretty good team, don't you think? - Yeah. - Do you want to get out of here? I-I'd like that, but they won't let me out. I'm supposed to help people. No one has the right to keep you here. You and I, we're going to travel around the world and help people play and win. Kevin? Kevin? I need help. Okay. Okay, let's go. Hey! Hey, stop! I said stop! - Let's go, let's go! - Let's get him! They ought to be giving you better food and cable TV and letting you go out into the city, am I right? - Say yeah! - [all] Yeah! Say yeah! [chanting] But I got to go. Don't give up the fight! Your cause is a just one! [chanting] - [beeps] - [tires screeching] Woohoo! Okay. Let's get down to business. The thing we're about to do, it's not illegal because no one believes it's even possible. The main risk is being found out as a team. Casinos don't take kindly to teams. So, we have to make it as though it's every man for himself. That's easy. So where do we start? [Michael] Craps. Some players take turns rolling the dice while others... place bets on all the possible outcomes. Throw a seven to start with. [blows] All right. Not bad for a first attempt. Okay, everybody. Let's simulate a real casino. Eric, let's say you play the dice. Try not to attract too much attention. If you notice something unusual, raise your hand. You two, get behind the poker table. [chuckles] No way. I haven't searched cards for ten years. Well, excellent. Kevin? [inaudible] Uh, if he gets stuck like this in the casino, security definitely would take notice. That's precisely why we have Tony. Tony, see the camera over there? Can you make it point away from us? [thunder] [electrical sounds] [thunder] [electrical sounds] Okay. Let's play. [sighs] Where are the chips? Give me a ten, baby. Okay. Here's the money. If it looks strange, I'm calling security. Okay, Tony, mind the camera. Kevin, reassure the croupier. - Try to be more careful. - Yeah, I will. I have fours. Dammit! Place your bets. [blows] Wow. [laughing] Excellent. Here's the money, 300. Leon! Okay, you're doing great. Now, trying going on without me. Okay, let's rock, baby. Woo! Place your bets. [Eric] I'm bet on six. Place your bets. Kevin, you've broken him. Give me, give me the chips. This watch cost me 200 euros. Give me. I don't need your watch. My eyes! I can't see anything! What have you done? Let's play for one of, one of my kidneys, okay? Dammit, Tony! I can see that! Turn the camera away! What did you do to me? - I'll kill you! I promise! - Put the gun down! - Give me the chips! - What did you do? Give me the damn chips! Give it to me! - I'll kill you! - What are you doing? - Shit! - Here you go. Just put it down. Give me the chips! I'll kill you! I don't know. Under my supervision, they can more or less manage but... can we somehow make them stronger? Trim them up a bit more. What if we stick small earpieces into their ears. They make them barely noticeable nowadays. Can she transmit thoughts? Tamara? Where does she live? [bell rings] [woman crying] Veronica, you have to help me. You have to help me, Veronica. - Tamara... - Leave me alone! - Whatever you want. - I can pay. [tires screeching] Tamara never had time. Where is she? Where'd she go? Go that way. I think you lost something. I'm not one of them. Why are they after you? Come on! I'm just trying to help... and I've got a proposition for you. You can't even help yourself. That casino, your debt, go to hell. Now I know why they're after you. While your grandmother was alive, she did their dirty work, didn't she? And now you have no one to protect you. I promise you, it's going to be very exciting. Just listen to me. By the way, you can earn some money and start a new life far, far away from here. Excuse me, sir. I lost my passport. Can you please help me? I need your help. [grunts] It's you again. Well, this must be destiny. Did you think about my offer? Come on. Believe me, will you? No. Think up a con for yourself. I guess everything is over. Yes, we're so sorry, sir. We're closed. I know I am late, I'm coming from far away, and my plane was delayed. Sorry. [Michael] A hypnotist will come up to you. He'll send you into the world of the subconscious, find the rooms of the subconscious for the people that you need and now they're in your power. Number one... number two. But remember, all you have is as few minutes. Can you stand, sir? - Are you okay to stand? - Yeah. - Everything's... - How are you? Don't arrest me. Everything's fine. Hey! Why'd you go over there? I'm sorry. Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. Brilliant, almost an exact copy. I don't know how I did it. It's like something took over me. Well, this is your accident, a masterpiece. Amazing. Yeah. You know what? I'll give you 500 euros for this work. Deal? Deal. You're such fun company. Could you shut up for a second? Can we talk? There are too many people here. Oops. I got to go. Sorry. Okay, everybody. This is Veronica. I don't know how to put this, but she can read and transmit thoughts. She's going to pass on my instructions to you as we play. Before we go to a casino, we must make sure that we can all dance to the same tune. Veronica, did you say there were too many people here? I think I got an idea. Let's dance. [indistinct voices] [water sounds] [indistinct voices] [Michael] [echoing] Make Eric ring the bell. Eric, the bell. - [bell ringing] - Tell Kevin to make two people run screaming for help. Kevin, make two people run screaming for help. [bell ringing] [screaming] Help me! - [screaming] - [bell ringing] [Michael] Tell Tony we need a short circuit. Tony, short circuit. [bell ringing] [screaming] [Michael] Veronica, we need an earthquake now. Tell the people in the square. Earthquake, earthquake, earthquake. - [bell ringing] - Earthquake. [Veronica] Earthquake. Earthquake, earthquake. Earthquake, earthquake, earthquake. Earthquake. [bell ringing] [bell ringing fades] Well, not bad at all. Let me buy you a drink. So, this is the plan. If we start with winning small amounts, that's going to take too much time. We could easily get blacklisted, which is no good. That's why we're going to the biggest and richest casino. There, they don't have limits on how much you can bet, which means one night... one big score. We all go in separately. We don't want them to think of us as a team. Tony, you're going to be a transportation manager and a security consultant. Kevin, you look refined enough to be a trust fund kid. Eric, you can just be yourself. - Spend papa's money. - That's easy. And you... you'll be my fiancée. Hug me, kiss me as hard as it may seem. You support me even when I lose. Is that what dumb brides do, huh? That's what not so dumb ones do, too. Are you all in? [Michael] Tell Tony to turn the camera away. Tony, camera. [Michael] Okay, we need a ten, tell Eric. Eric, throw a ten. All right. Must be my lucky day. [Veronica] Eric, you're up. [Michael] We were made to be together, don't you think? [Veronica] What are you talking about? [Michael] You and me. We're made for each other. Don't you think? [Veronica] You're forgetting something. I hear all your thoughts. [Michael] Look, we're like the ideal couple. We understand each other without saying anything. Yeah, that won't be easy. But we'll figure it out. Aw, uh, sorry guys. I mean, if you're lucky in gambling, you're probably unlucky with love. That's for you. - Eric, stay here. - [Michael] Eric, stay here. [Michael] Don't win yet. Good luck, gentlemen. [beeping] [Veronica] Kevin, croupier. Tony, camera. Yes. Good job. Congrats to you man. I'm back in the game. Last call. Woo! Let's rock, baby. Yeah, baby! [Michael] What the hell is he doing? He needs to stop drinking. Don't worry, Michael. It's all going to be all right. Just enjoy yourself. All bets down, no more bets. I am Michael. Tony, stop! You'll get us caught. Yeah! [Tony] I'm going to hit the jackpot! - [Michael] Tony, no jackpots. - Aha! - Eighty-four. - Woo! Yeah, baby! - Sir, come with me. - What's wrong? - Come with me. - Hey, what's wrong? Hey! What's wrong? Hey, let me get my money! Hey! - Sir, please. - Just a second. Come with me. I said come with me. [elevator bell] What the hell is going on? [elevator bell] Are you out of your mind? If you want your bodies to be found in a basement by following the trail of your teeth, then just keep doing what you're doing and pretty soon you're going to end up dancing tango with their head of security. But if you want to get out of here alive, rich... [elevator bell] [elevator bell] [elevator bell] Alive in one piece and rich, then do exactly as I say. You understand? Meet me at the craps table in five minutes. [chattering] May I? [Michael] Kevin, croupier. [Michael] Tony, camera. [cheering] That's for you. [inaudible] [ocean water crashing] What? So that's it? You know, I've been thinking maybe we can do one more job. I don't know, something easy. It seemed like you liked it. And then we can split up. There are plenty of easy jobs just waiting to be done. Come on. What do you say? We can make a pretty good team. It will never be over for you, will it? Besides, I don't need money. Don't need money, huh? That's interesting. Nobody needs money, but everybody wants it. Why are you still here? You could have left whenever you wanted to. From the very beginning, if you don't need money. Because unlike you... Oh. ...you think you're some great professional hustler who knows where to take risks. You're just a selfish gambler who's trapped in their own vice. You see yourself in a dark pit, playing the role of your own savior. So no, no thank you. You're probably right. We should leave it be as it is. And you just stay in your cocoon... where there's nothing, just you, your fears, your music and nothing else. Not even hope. I want to congratulate you. You learned a lot. But this is where our lessons have to stop. [laughing] Are you saying that I, I will have a prom dance at the office? I can't let you go any further. Remember what I told you - about not having a partner? - Yes, yes. I'm working on it. It's just taking a little longer than I thought. By the way, how's that guy doing? He's making progress, a lot. And besides, he's not alone anymore. Oh, he's not for long. He's never stayed with anyone for long. Who's there with him. Professional grifters? No. These guys are involved in the same thing we're doing. I may send you suggestions, of course. I was hoping he'd come to me of his own will. But we'll have to play it a lethal way. If the mountain doesn't come to Mohammed, Mohammed will go to the mountain. [car horn] What do you want? [car horn] Come on. [tires screeching] Try to lose them. Step on it! I'm sorry, Michael. You guys really are masters. You surprise me. Victor, I have your money, take it. Oh, I have already taken it. But these guys are worth more to me. I will never work for you. What can you do? Might can turn that gun into a banana. Wow, really? [chuckles] Really? Hmm? [laughs] It doesn't work every time. Come on. Michael, I would let you go, mm, but I'm afraid they aren't taking this situation seriously enough. Sorry. - No, wait. - No. - Wait. - No. [shouting] Michael, no! No! [gunshot] [inaudible] [thunder] [speaking Italian] Come, quickly... You bastard. What? You? What the hell! Oh, I got it. Oh, it all makes sense now. It was you from the very beginning! - I can't believe it was all you! - Hey. Goddamit! I haven't seen you for ten years, and you show up, and you ruin... ruin one of my best operations! Well, I was hoping you'd come and see me. For your information, normal children do that. They go to their parents with their problems. - Oh. - Yeah. And they don't gather a team of psychics to rob a casino. After all you did, Dad? You should have realized that I'd never ask for your help. Bambino, Bonjourno, take me back. Hey, Michael. You haven't spoken to me in ten years. I didn't know what to do. All right. Maybe it wasn't the best idea, but what else could I have done? I don't know. You could have just called. Well, somehow I... ...didn't think of that. But I saved your life, didn't I? No, you set me up. Just like you did many times before! What are you talking about? It was your education. Do you remember what happened in Belgrade? [scoffs] You take everything so negatively. Do I? All right. Perhaps I went a little too far then. - Yeah, - Too far. Michael. Michael! Michael... do you remember how we dreamed of one day finding the door in the wall? Favorite story. Do you remember that? Why are you telling me this? Because I know where to find it. [man] You got 30 minutes for lunch. Shit. He needs to eat something. He was probably given some medication in the hospital. He's getting worse. We shouldn't have taken him from the clinic. We should have done lots of things differently. [clanging sounds] Tony? Hello? Hey, what's the matter? Well, the toilet was clogged. How the hell? - Oh my... Oh my God, Michael! - Quiet. I don't have nine lives. - What the...? - Michael! - We were going crazy. - But how did you... It's a long story. Later, later. I'm going to get you out of here and the money, too. Where's Veronica? She, uh... [clears throat] refused to work for Victor. She's been in a coma for several days now. She went into the subconscious. Screw it. I quit. Me, too. Do whatever you want. Take them downstairs. I'll come down in a moment and deal with them myself. Hands off! Keep an eye on the door. Come on. Open the door, please. Awesome. So what now? Now, you open the safe. You have five minutes. Where is she? Upstairs in the hotel, room 209. Good luck! I can't turn them all off. But I can turn off a couple. What? Are you kidding me? Are you scared? I hate Twister. Let's rock, baby. [alarm siren] Come on, man. Come on. How much longer do you have? - Just tell me where you are. - Faster. Hurry up, will you? - Tell me how much. - Would you stop talking? Let me work! What the hell, Jack? It's us! [gunshots] - Oh, shit. - Go on, work! Come on. Please, come on. I love you, baby! [beeping] [exhales] Excellent. So, what's next? Well... that's it. What? What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean that's it? We're locked in a steel tomb with a bunch of armed guards outside, and you're telling us that this is where your plan ends? This is the safest place in the whole casino. They can't get to us here. And now I need to get to Veronica. Dammit! He set us up, guys! Game over. I need you to help me get to her wherever she is. You're normal. You're not like us. So what? We all have rooms. That's how I can get to her, right? Even if you managed to get there, it's not certain that you'll get abilities. I don't need them. You're not ready for this. You will die. Nobody knows that for sure, but it's the only chance I have, that you have... that we all have. I need you to help me get to her. I don't know how. Kevin, listen to me! Make me into my subconscious. Let him try. Okay. The moment they come out of there, kill them all. [boy] Mama, why do you always have to leave? When are you coming back? [man] There is nothing. Just you, your fears, your music and nothing else. Not even hope. [man 2] Freeze! You're under arrest. Keep your hands where I can see them. [woman] You're just a selfish gambler who's trapped in their own vice. [man 3] Guilty! You're sentenced to six months in juvenile detention! Veronica... where could you be? [crackling] [exhales] Veronica. Veronica, we need to go. What did you do? Veronica, can you hear me? What did you do, Veronica? We need to go. Hear me out! We don't have any more time. We need to go. [inaudible] Veronica! Dammit! You can't hear me. I know how you hear me. Veronica. Veronica. Veronica, we need to go. We need to go now. Can you feel that? What are you talking about? I didn't know it was possible to feel the world like this. Veronica, listen to me. Those feelings are not real. You have to come with me! Michael, you're dead. I'm real, and I'm alive. Calm down. Be with me. Veronica, listen to me! You have to trust me! I don't have much time. How about this? I'm not leaving. I have nothing there. Then I'm not leaving without you. Besides you, I have nothing there. Believe me, will you? Yes. Why did you do it? What? You risked your life for me. You know, in every man's life, there's certain limits that you cannot cross, [chuckles] whether it's out of fear or just because he doesn't even believe it's even possible. Then I met you. [chuckles] And here I am, crossing all the limits of my mind, and the only thing I can believe and think of is being here with you forever, but that's not possible. This is it. Let's go. I've been told it doesn't work that way. What? Why? I have to find my own way out of this. - I'll go with you. - No. If you don't leave now, all of this will be in vain. When you wake up, I'll already be there waiting for you. You said you were going to believe me, didn't you? Didn't you? [gasps] Michael. Michael. [Gordon] You see these doors? Each one of them is the entrance to someone's home, someone's apartment. There are all kinds of people living there. Some of them very nice, others not so. You go in, and you give them a suitcase and some money. Their lives will change. You go in, and you take their savings, you will change, too, but in a different way. I know. These doors... I mean, they're closed to us, ordinary people. Each apartment has a back door. And every person has limitless opportunities. Michael, that world contains all the knowledge and secrets of humanity, everything that ever was in every person's mind dead or alive. Now can you imagine the possibilities? We can learn whatever we want. We can get whatever we want. Just... just please don't tell me you, you thought of a new business. The biggest business of our lives. God damn. Aren't you too old for this? Uh, maybe... [chuckles] and there is one problem. Even special people who go there have failed to return. Eight minutes... is how long you can survive there alone. Then you begin to forget about your own systems. In the end, the mind dissolves, merges with billions of other minds. You will never... ...get back to your senses if someone doesn't remind you of who you are. So, I need a partner. So you brought me here just because you needed me again? [laughs] You always wanted to know what was behind the white door, right? I thought about it, and I realized the only person I can trust is you. You don't get it, do you? Because of you, I brought some good people into trouble. I still feel uncomfortable about the problems I brought to you. I want to help you... as your father. Now, there is one man. You know him, but this time he will be on your side, and you will have to share with him. Take it. This will be your compass. I think this is something you have needed your whole life. All of my life I needed a... father, but, yeah, sure, this is also nice. Thank you. By the way, uh, don't forget about my share. This doesn't mean that I'll be your partner. [laughing]I was just kidding. No, I wasn't. [laughing] Just kidding. Good boy. [Eric] Wait. Wait, wait, wait! [Veronica] No! No! Now you know who you are and what you can do. [Alex] We're in your memories. I pulled you out. Now finish it yourself. How can I save them? Look inside of them and try to capture its essence. Sometimes there's more truth in illusion than in reality. The key to any problems in a person's mind. Now step to the right and fall. No! No! Wait, wait, wait, wait! [screams] [breathing heavily] Sorry, I got held up. Michael? Grab the money. We're leaving. - Woo! - Yeah! [Eric] Yes! You lied to me again. [Tony] Let's do this. Trust me only when I lie. Tony. Michael, are you crazy? They're going to kill us. Will you trust me? [beeping] [Michael] Hustles are a game too. And the better you know your opponents, the more money you can win. But let me tell you. This... this was only part of my plan. But the greatest art is to control your enemy... and the key to your victory, it's in his head. Now what is the main weakness of a person whose subconscious is like a bulletproof safe? That's right. He's afraid of losing everything. And this... this is the final part of my plan. They got out on the other side. Everyone outside now! They're getting away! All of you! This is yours. Great job, guys. I think your talents should be put to better use than taking on a casino. I have a proposition for all of you. Give me that thing, paid five million for it. Oh, wait. It was my five million. - Let's not argue. - Let's not. Ah, you ready for the greatest scam in the history of mankind? Just this one job, and then we go our separate ways. That's exactly what your mother said to me once.
