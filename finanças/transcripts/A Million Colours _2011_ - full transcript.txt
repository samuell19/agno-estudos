Turn around slowly and keep your hands up. Gentlemen, I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial solution. We don't negotiate with car thieves. Oh, come on, 500? We don't do bloody charity. - 800. - Who's the car for? Some rich drug lord? For Nelson Mandela. He's going to need a good car when he gets out of prison. That's it. Get up, boy. Get up! Get up! Get up! Come on, stand up, kaffer. Come on. You know, in Zulu tradition, a condemned man can challenge his accusers to single combat. One on one. Who's up for it? Who the hell do you think you're talking to? Come on, guys. Three big white boys to beat up one little kaffer? Little bugger thinks he's Muhammad Ali. I'll take him. Break his head in three seconds. - I'll whip his ass in two. - He's mine. Oh, boy. Come on, stop playing with him, man! - It's not your sister! - Take him down! Unhh! Beautiful! Not smiling now, eh? Stop! Best you do not kill him. Better you know who that kaffer is before his dead face appears on the morning news, maybe. This is Muntu Ndebele. Before he became a thief, he was the most famous actor in South Africa. He was my best friend. * My name is Norman Knox. I want to tell you a story about my friend Muntu. We were an unlikely pair in those days of apartheid. As kids, we acted together in a popular film... and after that we grew up together. He was in almost every sense my brother. The film's success kept Muntu and me in the spotlight through our teenage years, but the magical days of fame did end, because as South Africa went through its struggle years, so did we... and for Muntu, most of the trouble had to do with love. Whoa, whoa... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop... Hey! Muntusa! So you're back! Joh, joh, joh, joh, joh... Where did you get this car? What's this, eh? Did you buy it in America, eh? Pela Busi, e'Lollipop just sold to television, and I got a beautiful bonus. Now all of America is gonna see my movie. Now, Muntu, my friend, you're the only one in the whole school who has a car now. Ah, man, listen. Things are going to change. One day very soon, eh, everyone in Soweto is gonna have a car. I'm serious. You know what? Right now, all you're seeing is black against white, neh? But I'm telling you, one day very soon, you're gonna see a million colors... So, ladies! Who wants a ride? Me! I wanna go! Sipho... Who's that? That... that's Sabela. New. All the way from Zululand. Yeah, let's fly. Sure. I'm coming. Class, today you are receiving new math and science textbooks. From now on, you will not be taught these subjects in English. They will be taught to you in the language of Afrikaans. But sir, sir! We don't even understand Afrikaans. Afrikaans is the language of apartheid. It is not even a language. It is a dialect of Dutch. How can we learn in a language that we don't even understand? To hell with Afrikaans. I'm not going to speak it. Let's strike. Quiet! It is now national government policy. You have no choice. * Going my way? So, you're from Zululand? My father just found work on the mines. My name is Muntu. From e'Lollipop. Yes, I've seen it. Of course! When? Years ago. On the wall of our village shop. The ending, sure. I cried so much when you died. Well, I'm alive! Listen. My movie e'Lollipop is playing again at Jo'burg on Saturday. Come with me. Plus, you can meet my friend, Norman. My father... he doesn't like me out late. If we're forced to study in this Afrikaans, we will all fail. We'll never get to go to college, never be anybody. The whites, they don't want us to advance so they'll always have servants. It's not that bad, Sabela. Things are changing. I mean, there are thousands of whites who've gone to go see my movie. There's still hope. My family moved here so I can have an education, go to college. This Afrikaans, eh! It's not that difficult. Okay, let me give you a first lesson. A kat is a cat. A mat is a mat. - Wind is wind... exactly. - Wind. And minus is minus. It's easy as that. So, you're a teacher as well as an actor. Sabela, I think you're the most beautiful girl in all of Soweto. Second lesson tomorrow after school? Yes. Tomorrow. Bye-bye. Yeah, Baba. - Ah, Norman. - How's it going, man? - Awesome, man. - Awesome, man? Listen, my man, before we go, the phone company, they gave us the grants. We're going to college, my brother. - What? - Yes! - Are you serious, man? - Buddies... It's gonna be crazy. Can we get two tickets, please. I said two tickets. Sorry, whites only. We're not missing this one, bro, come on. Norman, I've fallen in love, man. This was, like, the best part. I've got something... a lollypop. I'm sorry, you're gonna have to leave. I just paid for two tickets. It's against the law. This is a whites-only cinema. You see that screen? It's Muntu Ndebele. It's Muntu Ndebele. Norman Knox. Norman Knox. I know who you are. It's the law. Look, if you don't leave, I'm gonna have to call the police. - Just ignore them. Forget it. Relax. - They're crazy, man. Listen, did you see how they love us up there? Let's go somewhere where we're definitely gonna have fun. * - * Don't give - * Don't give up, no - * Don't give - * Don't give in - * Keep on - * Keep on... Can I just take one photo? Why the hell is there a white face looking at me? Are you a racist? Ooh, gents, gents. Bomba. Bomba. It's all right, Mama Cash. Bomba... It's Norman. Come on, man, he's cool. He's cool. He's cool, jah. Come on. Nice car outside, Muntu. Ta, bro. Keys. Uh, no, Bomba, I mean, no one drives my Ford Capri, bro. Let's go. Dear Lord, we thank You for this food. Let it make us strong to do your work. May it give Muntu strength to do what is right always. Uh, Ma... And let us be thankful for Your blessings. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen! Okay, let's eat. - Here you go. - Thanks for that. Hey, Ma, me and Norman got bursaries to go to college. I'm so proud of you boys. And you, Norman buti, what are you going to study? Oh, Ma, pela Norman's going to be president one day. He's gonna end apartheid. For sure, man, but I'm gonna need a deputy. I'm your man. * All the schools in Soweto will march to Orlando Stadium. And then what? Just get there and talk? No. We hand over the petition to the Board of Education. We are going to march whether they like it or not! - Are we tired of it? - Yes! C-I-Y-A! C-I-Y-A! C-I-Y-A! Sabela! Sabela! Muntu. Sabela? What's wrong? Let's drive somewhere. Anywhere. What happened? What's wrong, Sabela? What happened? Baba, Muntu... He wants to sell me to be married. What? Why? He offers a very large lobola. Hey, hey! What are you doing? Don't you like me? Like you? I think you're the most beautiful girl in the world. Please. Let me. No. The chiefs, they only want virgins. Yeah, Sabela, but not like this. You're a good man, Muntu. I want to be with you. Look. I'll think of something, okay? Don't worry. I promise. Sabela, everything's going to be okay. Just come with me and have some tea in the house, and I'll take you home, okay? Okay. No! Baba! Please, baba! Sabela! You must go! Sabela! So, you have trouble? I'm in love. Big trouble. Can you help me, Rakwaba? Maybe. So, what is the name of this trouble of yours? Beautiful Sabela, from Zululand. Ah... Sabela. - Mazibuko. - Ah, so you know her? Yeah, her father wants to send her to a Zulu chief. He found us in my car the other night. Now he keeps her locked up in the house. And? No, no, nothing happened. I swear it. Maybe. Well, she wanted to, but... Oh, she's very clever, this girl. Maybe more clever than you are. Are you saying that we actually should have? But is it right for her to be given to a total stranger? What do you see? I see a Zulu chief more powerful than my Muntu! * Sabela. Sabela! Muntu, what are you doing here? Look, I have to talk to you. Okay. Wait for me by the corner. Okay. I cannot stay a virgin. It is my only hope. - No. That's not the answer. - Then what is? I don't know, Sabela, I just know that's not the answer. Easy for you to say. You have a car, a movie, a bursary. I have nothing but a future with an old, fat man that I do not love. That's it. That's it. The car, my bursary, the cash from the movie! That's all we'll need to run away where no one can find us! You would do that for me? For us, Sabela. Oh, Muntu, you're such a dreamer. And that dream will start tomorrow. Tomorrow. But tomorrow is the march. But that's even better. Listen, we'll leave right after the march is finished. No one will notice that we're gone. They'll only realize once we're far, far away. This march is illegal! You must disperse and go back to your school. This march is illegal! You are in violation of statutory laws! You must disperse immediately! I'm warning you! You must disperse! They're throwing rocks! Watch out! Cease fire! That's an order! Stop shooting! Cease fire! Sabela! Sabela! No! Muntu! Sabela! Sabela, run! * Sabela! Sabela! Sabela! Sabela! Sabela! Sabela! No! Keep your composure. Hold still. Let them come. Aim for the legs. Aim low. Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Now! Sabela. Sabela. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Please help us. Please. I need to take her to the hospital. Pretty young thing, isn't she? Muntu... Aah! Muntu... No. You can't run fast or far enough, boy! I will find you! Oh, Sabela... Come on. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Rioting erupted in black township of Soweto. Hundreds are reported killed as the violence spreads across the country. The bloody uprising galvanizes the movement against South Africa's apartheid regime. Help! Help! Somebody help me! Help! - Sipho! Sipho! - My face, man! Look at my face. I'll be back. I'll be back. Doctor! Doctor! Here. Put her here. The bullet passed straight through. She's lucky. Orderly! Sabela. Sabela. You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay. I'll be back. I'll be back, Sabela. * Civilians are not allowed into Soweto. I've got to get inside. My friend's in there. He needs my help. Orders are no one goes into Soweto. Hey! Hey! Stop now! You keep back or I'll shoot you in the face! I've got to get in! Let me through. Listen, ya! Turn this bike around and fuck off! Muntu, come on! Bomba, what are you doing with my car? Your car is now property of the struggle. Bro, you're leaving the country, to Angola. - Angola?! - Yeah, bro. Busi, what do you know about Angola? You're going to join the ANC guerrilla training camp. I want out. I want out, Busi! Are you crazy? The police are looking for you and your Ford Capri all over. A new era had begun. War. Every young white man was called to military service and trained to battle with those who wanted to overthrow the government. Welcome to the Army, boys. I am Sgt. Major Wikus van Zyl. I'm here to teach you how to kill the Communist insurgents that are trying to destroy our country. Your enemy no longer carries a spear. He carries an AK-47 assault rifle, and he will use it on you! He's armed by Russians, trained by Cubans and East Germans, clothed and fed by Swedish faggots! For the next year, you will be defending our nation against him. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir! Are you deaf, roof? Are you a liberal? I thought I smelled something. Rifleman Knox. Do you wear red underpants, eh? Tried to get out of conscription, didn't you? I did. You did what, sir?! I do not want to be in the Army, sir! Well, we will just have to see about that, won't we? Right, roofies! Mandela's organization, the ANC, had created secret guerrilla training camps outside South Africa trained by communist Cubans. Basta! Move it! The youth who opposed apartheid were now very much a part of the Cold War. As Chairman Mao has taught us, if there is no class division, there is no poverty. Now these white colonists, they come to your country and they tell you Bible stories while they take your land! And what do these imperialist pigs do to fight their own race? They poison your drinking water to make you impotent! Now, we don't want to be impotent, comrades! We want to be hard! But first we must make you hard. We must teach you to see at night, to work with explosives, to fight with skill and efficiency. This is nonsense. You got something to say, comrade?! They have guns. Helicopters. We're not fools, man! If you really want us to fight, get these Russians of yours to send us proper weapons! This comrade will be silenced. Comrade! That decision is ours to make. We decide who is silenced. Comrade, the black man is the laughing stock of the world. You want to change that, then you must exercise discipline! Or maybe the white man's water has made you soft, hmm? Soft. Like this comrade, who has so much to say. Tried to smuggle out a letter to his chica... I'm Muntu Ndebele, heh? I'm Muntu Ndebele. You know who I am? Huh? You know who I am? You stupid bastards! Oh, Sabela. Muntu, here. Drink this quick. Oh... CQ! Bravo is under attack! The South African Army is attacking! Bomba. Hey, hey, hey! What the hell are you doing with my car? - What the hell-- push the car? - Push? Get out of my car, Bomba! Get back and push, Muntu! Bomba! Wait! Wait! Bomba, wait! Stop! Bomba! Come back! Bomba! After the student march, the country was in turmoil. International sanctions intensified. The economy was under pressure. Everywhere, people lost their jobs. Sabela's father was without work. He blamed Sabela and all the students who had marched. After Muntu escaped the camp, he journeyed for thousands of miles to get back to Sabela. Newspapers announced that there were no survivors. Sipho... Sabela... there has been some news. What happened? What's happening? A camp was under attack, and everyone was killed. Sabela, Muntu. Muntu. - What is our mission? - Kill terrorists! - Again! - Kill terrorists! Atten, halt! Are you here to kill terrorists, Knox? No, Sergeant-Major! Knox's failure is your failure! You will all run the hill until Knox learns to value your lives more than those of his terrorist friends! Yeah, Baba. * Eee! Oh, Baba... Stop! Stop! Hold it! Stop! Knox! Shoot him! Knox! Shoot him, Knox! Go! Shoot him! Come on! * Unh. You could've gotten someone killed today, Knox. Someone did get killed. Well, you're gonna stay in here until you've sweated every last black drop out of you. Look what you're in, Norman. I'll fucking kill you! Sipho! Muntu! Muntu! There's our names. They failed everyone that marched. No, man! If they failed me, then I can't use my bursar to go to college. Maybe college is overrated, man. No, Sipho. That was our way to change things. That was my way to provide for Sabela. I don't know how to say this to you, but... Sabela's gone, married to that Zulu chief. She thought that you were dead, man. We all did. NCO Mess, Sgt. Major van Zyl speaking. Phone call for Norman Knox. Some kaffer called Muntu. Sir, please, just tell him I'm busy. Tell him yourself. I'm not your bloody secretary. Hello? Oh, thank God I found you. I've been calling everywhere. I've called forever. Listen, I need to come see you. No way! No, Norman, this is serious, man. Sabela's been sent to some Zulu chief. Nothing is going right. I-- This country is going to hell, and you talking about your love life? Unbelievable. Norman. What's wrong with you? Look... You won't believe what I've been through, Norman. They failed all of us who marched in Soweto, all right? They? The government is trying to steal our education! Don't you get it? I am they. The world has changed. You know what? It's your fault. You and your lousy communist comrades. The march started all this crap. What the hell's wrong with you, Norman? Don't you understand we had to? We had to! You gotta ruin your own life. Stay out of mine. Don't ever, ever call me again. Norman! Norman! I assume that you've had six too many? Six too few. I lost a friend today. Norman is dead. Dead? Yeah, well, he might as well be. How could I be so wrong about someone? Screw him. I'm your friend. What would make you happy, huh? A Ford Capri. Then let's go get one. Fokolo money, Sipho, man. I said get one, not buy one. - No. No, no, stealing is wrong. - Wrong? White people stole everything from us, our land, our jobs, our education, man. So, no, mm-mmm, I don't think it's stealing at all, just repossessing, man. Repossession. Let's go, man, let's go! * Muntu, let's go! Get inside, man! Muntu! So yeah, Muntu, you've got your Capri now. But still no Sabela. Repossession, man. Repossession. Company, halt! Knox, what the hell are you doing? Knox! - I'm not going. - Not going where? I'm not gonna kill anyone! What the fuck! Aah! You are a coward. Don't you hear me? You are finished, Knox. I will DD1 your liberal ECC ass, and you will rot in DB for years! Huh? You're a coward? Norman. Norman. What's wrong with you? D5-K5, mentally unfit for service. Wake up. Knox. Look at you. Is it worth it? Yeah. Muntu! Muntu! They said you were dead. Sabela, without you, I am dead. No. We can't. We can't, Muntu. Sabela, I love you. I'm married to the chief. I belong to him. No, that was a mistake. We can change it, Sabela. We must be together. Do you still love me? I will always love you. Aha. Sabela. And now you know why the actor became the thief. Faster, man! Come on! They're catching up! Faster, Muntu, faster! Let's go! The church! The church! Put away those guns! This is the house of God! You have two criminals, senor. Two? We have 200 sinners in here, each and every one seeking the glorious mercy of God! - Amen? - Amen! - Sorry, Reverend, for this. - Rakwaba. The two boys that you're looking for. I believe they've set fire to your cars. To our two guests, God has spared you the consequences of your foolishness. Repent and give your lives to Him. Amen? Amen. * Many times, Muntu tried to quit crime, but many times he would go back. When he asked God for forgiveness, he asked forgiveness for me, too. Hey, Muntu. It's terrible what happened to that truck the other day, but tomorrow, we'll get another one. No, man. I'm out, Sipho. I'm finished with this crime business. Muntu, don't be stupid. Don't be stupid, man. I'm out of it! What now? Shh! Bomba. Bombisto. What a place! Hello, Muntusa. Muntu, the struggle needs you. You will supply us with transportation. The last memory I have of you, comrade, were taillights and a cloud of dust leaving me to die in Angola. What makes you think... I'm going to work for you? Your life's hanging by a thread. Don't make me cut it. Silver Mercedes. The big one, 350 SE. The kind those rich government whiteys drive in Pretoria. I want that one in two days. 2,000, cash. 2,000. Cash. Yeah, Baba? It was, in fact, the gunshot wound Sabela suffered during the student march that caused her infertility. After I was discharged from the army, I drifted hopelessly for years. - It does! - It doesn't! I couldn't get any more work as an actor. My life was at a standstill. Why are you fighting? We weren't fighting. Then one night I saw my old film and I realized what I had to do. * With an old projector and a few meager possessions, I traveled to remote villages to share the only good thing I'd ever done in my life. * Your car's ready. Always the best. You said two grand. There's like 10,000 in here. That's right. I always look after my people. Remember that. Oh, and this? Put those on the car before my boys deliver it. Oh, Busi. Uh... Busi... So I see you have some money now. Uh, yeah. I can't. I can't. I can't. Saam. Oh, Sipho. Oh, my head. Have some coffee, man. Crazy night. * Hey, isn't this the car we stole for Bomba? Women, children... Hello, Mom. Where have you been? Uh, I'm working, Mama. What kind of work? Where are you living? Norman was looking for you. Norman has abandoned me, Mama. It's you who doesn't want to see him or any of us because you are ashamed of what you've become. You dare bring that in here? It's for you, Mama. For you, for Lindi, for the church. Look at you. A drunken fool. You disgrace this house, Muntu. Change your life. Change it, Muntu, otherwise God may change it for you. God... God, Mama! He's forsaken this whole damned country! It's you who have abandoned God! Abandoned Him and shamed us all! This is no longer your home. Get out. And don't you ever come back until you've changed your ways! Get out. Get out. Get out. Sorry, Mama. * The party leaders failed to recognize Bomba's bravado in blowing up the building in Pretoria. His lust for power only grew deeper and deeper. Yo! Bomba? I have wonderful news. Give me your hand. A baby. At last, one of our own. The ancestors have spoken. Yes. You're pleased? Oh, Bomba, I'm so glad you're pleased. Get some healthy food. Okay. Muntu, let's leave Soweto. You and me. Away from this madness, you know? Look, we can start out fresh. What are you talking about? Muntu, I love you. I've always loved you. And I know I can make you happy. I know I can. Just go away. Muntu, please. Please, just listen to me. Go away, Busi. It's Sabela, isn't it? - It's always--! - Don't talk about her. Muntu, the great actor. Just too poor to get the girl he loves. You... You don't even have the guts to do a big job. When the real heroes... Hey, man. Hey, when the real heroes, when they are out there exploding bombs to free our people, what do you do, hmm? Cry like a baby? What do you want? Hmm? Money. Here. Take it. Take it, Busi! Take it! Just take it! You're a coward. That's what you are, Muntu, a coward! You're all cowards. You steal cars, and now you think you're what... Huh? Heroes? Tell us about America, boy. America, hmm, feel cold. Statue of Liberty. Empire State. - I saw a television. - What's a television? A television? Television is a box where people live inside. You wanted to see me? Good evening, Xolile Bomba Mlandezo. I'm Major Dickson of the Security Police. You mind answering a few questions about that car bomb in Pretoria? Who sold me out? Our arrangement works on a need-to-know basis. Go to hell. Hell is a place you're gonna be familiar with very soon, if you don't cooperate. Take them away. Not him. Everybody out! Get up. I have you to thank for this, don't I? The student march, 16th of June, 1976. It took great courage to do what you did that day. I respect courage. For the courage, you'll be rewarded. For this... Sipho. I don't want to hear it, vit. No, I'm serious. I don't hear about any of your schemes. Can you imagine? Bomba is in prison, all right? I don't want to hear anything about this world of crime. Okay, okay, then I guess I won't tell you what I just heard from my cousin who just got back from Zululand. - Mm-hmm. - In fact, I have some news about Sabela. What? What about her? The chief took two other wives 'cause Sabela wasn't giving him any children. Are you serious? So is he still married to her? Yeah he's married to her, but now Sabela's just a servant to the other wives. Muntu? Oh, Sabela. What are you doing here? I've come to rescue you. Rescue me? Yeah, but they'll kill you. I won't let them treat you like a slave, Sabel! You're coming with me right now. But... Shh. Shh. - Muntu! - Sabela! Aah! Ah. Sabela, I never stopped loving you. Is it true? You stole cars? It's in the past. No more crime. Muntu, promise me that you will not repay that lobola with stolen money. - Promise me. - I promise. Oh, Baba... He would rather kill me than see me marry you. I'll talk to him. He's going to give us his blessing. He's going to. You'll see. You'll see. Never! Never! One hundred cows! Where are you gonna get that kind of money, huh? I don't know, Sipho. I just need those cows, Rakwaba. Maybe Bomba can give you a loan. Bomba's in prison for life, remember? Ah, no, no, no. Bomba's free, man. Bomba is out? How? You don't think he sold out, do you? Hm, maybe. After Nelson Mandela was released from prison, democracy drew nearer, but secret police forces were arming gangs to create a tribal war that would derail the negotiations the government was having with Mandela. Nelson Mandela's released from prison. - Let's celebrate. - Celebrate? Mandela has renounced violence. They set a trap for him, and he fell for it. Bomba, I need to borrow some cash. In fact, I want to buy a taxi and get into a taxi business. The number one car thief in Soweto wants to buy a taxi? It's for lobola. I need to make the money legally. Please. Muntu, the lover. Okay, but a third of what you make comes to me. Good evening. We need to speak privately. Muntu. Mandela's given up the Armed Struggle. Now, your government is going to hand him the power. You don't trust Mandela any more than I do, Bomba. That makes us partners. Remember the deal we made that got you out of jail. The blacks who support Mandela's peace process, they must be attacked. Blacks fighting blacks, blood on the streets, that's what we need. Can you make that happen? How much are you paying these days? Gold. It's not enough, Baba. Do it, and I'll let you in on the biggest score of all. You see, soon a convoy of diplomatic cars will transport a fortune in gold Kruger coins. Let's just say there's some in the government who don't trust Mandela's promises. Do it, and I'll supply you with the details of this convoy. One day, you will be working for me. Hm. We shall see. Pleasure doing business with you. I know you know Mercedes-Benz electronic security systems. I am not interested. Bomba, bro, I'm trying to get into a legitimate business. I promise I'll pay back your loan. What if you made enough in one score so you wouldn't have to get a loan? Enough to buy a fleet of taxis? Enough to pay lobola and get your wife? One time! The secret police put their plan to divide and conquer into motion. Rival gangs were armed and paid to terrorize the streets. The path to freedom was in jeopardy. Listen, Busi, it's pretty crazy out there. I don't think it's a good idea for you to be out. Hayibo, Sipho, nothing's going to stop me from having a good time tonight. Oh, this music... always makes me feel good. And what about your baby? He's with his Uncle Sipho. But Busi, I thought that we could spend some time together. Sure, Sipho. Oh. Hey! Mandela forges peace... but much blood will flow before... maybe. One last big score. After this score, I'll have enough money to pay for Sabela's lobola. This gold was stolen by government officials. Why can't I take it back? Then you'll also be guilty. I lost her once before. I don't want to lose her again. Hey, Muntu, come join in the fun. Fun? I'm not gonna be a part of Bomba's madness, man. Hey, you. A sellout? Impimpi, huh? Look, I don't want trouble. Don't do this... This is what Dixon wants, man! They're all impimpi, sellouts! Just like that whore, O Busi. O Busi? O Busi? What are you talking about? Who do you think told the Boere about the car bomb? You're crazy! O Busi? Don't worry. We will sort her out. Tonight. No. No, you can't. You can't. Oh. We were just, um... Leave her alone, Bomba. You have much important business. Busi, how much did Dixon pay you to sell me out? Bomba, it's not true! And I was your girlfriend, remember? I can still be your girlfriend, Bomba, anything you want-- Please! Give her a real necklace. My baby! Bomba, I had to save my baby! Stop this! Stop it! Stop it! Bomba. I didn't mean it... Don't do this. Don't do this! Please, I beg you, please! No! No! Come on! Please! Bomba, please! Bomba, please! Bomba! Don't! Bomba! Bomba, please. Bomba, I beg you, please. My baby! Bomba, no! No, Bomba! Bomba-- Bomba! Busi! Let me go! We go tomorrow to get that Kruger gold. You're driving. If not, your whole family gets the necklace. Busi... Oh, Busi. Yeah, Muntu? She's dead, Sipho. Bomba killed Busi. I'm gonna go get that gold, Sipho. * And then I'm gonna do this whole country a favor. I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch. Where do we meet the convoy? Shut up. Drive. Turn left at the next road. Crazy, man. No one is gonna drive gold through here. Stop. Bomba, what is this? Insurance. - What? - We're picking up his wife. Whose wife? Bomba. Bomba! Don't mess with Dixon. There are gold coins just sitting there waiting for us, man! Why do you want to screw this up? Come on, for just a-- Vit. No way now! Take these things off of me right now! Bomba, come back here! Bomba! Bomba! Bomba! Dixie? Shouldn't you be meeting a certain convoy? Yes, but I needed some insurance. Leave her out of it. No! Goddamn it! Get away from me! Let her go! Let her go! I should've used this gun a long time ago when I had the chance. Tell your fools to drop their guns. Do it! Okay, gents. We're gonna go get that gold... and nothing is gonna stop us. Eh. No! Where's the convoy? I... Where's the convoy, Bomba? Sabela! Whatever hope Muntu had to get the money he needed for Sabela was gone. He saw no way out. He just disappeared. - Mr. Knox? - Yeah. Norman, I just saw the film. My name is Sabela. I'm a friend of Muntu. Muntu? He always said the two of you were like brothers. Do you know where he is? I don't. Been looking for him for years. You are the Sabela. Yep. Muntu once asked for my help. He came here a few years ago. He promised to come back. He never did. These were the dark days before the election, before Mandela would take power. The hope was great, but so was the fear. If nothing is done, he will rule the nation. I said there will be no violence. Some of the Zulus wanted the power for themselves, and Mandela's supporters had to be stopped. But many Zulu women favored Mandela. But if we vote for Mandela, we will be punished. It is your democratic right to vote for whom you want. Each person's vote is secret. No one else will know. See here? You see? My name is nowhere. Watch how I do it. I mark the box with an X. Then I fold the paper. See how easy it is? You see? It's inside the box. No one sees your vote. It's locked! Try the windows! Nombuso! Don't be afraid, children. These children have no mothers because you are a murderer. Hold it! Hold it! Let me assure you I did not order the killing of their mothers! You are the chief. You must punish those who did. Who will care for them? Shall they also be killed, so there are no witnesses? I was a witness. Will I be killed too? Is that what you want? Bring me those who did this thing. I want to have them right now. Understood? Sabela, they will carry your name. And they will have my protection. Norman Knox... and Muntu Ndebele. Shut up, Bomba. Shut up! Shut up, shut up... No! Sawubona, Mama. Norman! Muntu has not been here for years. Sipho told me that he was still in crime and drugs. Maybe he's dead. I searched for Muntu far and wide, but he was nowhere to be found. I placed an ad in the Sowetan newspaper offering a reward for his whereabouts. A tip finally led me to the notorious drug dens of the city. Go away! Muntu, open up! Go away! I'm sleeping! Go away! Muntu. Who are you? It's me, Muntu. It's Norman. It's okay. Norman. Just give me the gun. It's okay. Go away. Get out. Get out. Just go! Ah! Crazy bastard! Shoot me. Shoot me. You are coming with me. No, Muntu! I'll never forget how you abandoned me, Norman. Just go. Just go. Go! Okay. Okay. I'm going. I'm going, Muntu. * I'm sorry, my brother. Help me, Lord. Sabela! Oh, God, save us. You're my God. And Lord, for Hector Pieterson and all the other young heroes who gave their lives and their future for the cause of freedom, Lord, we praise You for their courage. Amen. May the grace of God be with you all. Go in peace. Sabela, I'm so sorry... No! You could not give me what I needed. I had to find it for myself. Just look at how God has blessed me. I'm free, Muntu. Free. The chief gave me my freedom. I have my own home in colonized Soweto. You no longer have to pay anything. But, but how? I don't understand. I have so much to tell you. But first, you must meet someone. This is Busi's child. He was given to me. What's his name? Tsepo. His name is Tsepo. He's your son, Muntu. Come. Tsepo, meet your Uncle Norman. Come. Let's get some ice cream. Yeah.
