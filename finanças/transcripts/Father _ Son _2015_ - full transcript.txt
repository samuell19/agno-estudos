Are you here to see Nut? He should be back soon. Yes. How much? 50 Baht, please. Just a second. I will get the money. A thousand Baht note? I don't have that much change for you. Then theres no need to give me any change. But... I'd like you to do something in return. What is it? Well, you know what I meant. Nut! You can pay me later. I've gotta go. Dad! I think you should stop bringing people here for sex. I work from home. Where else should I go? I don't care. I don't like it. Come on. If you don't let him bring anyone here, where else should he go? But! Alright alright. I won't bring anyone here for sex anymore. Anyway, Nut, does your family know you are seeing Nueng? Nobody knows. I'd like to keep it quiet. It's better that nobody knows. Well, it's up to you. Nueng. Do you always use rubber? Always wear! And we never betray each other! Never had sex with other people! Ok, Ok, I'm sorry. Let?s eat. Hey, please don't make deliveries to Tum's place anymore. Let someone else do it, will you? Whats the matter? Can't you see? I know he has had his eyes on you for some time. You?re a bit paranoid here. I wont let him trick me. I'm also a guy. If he tries to do anything to me, I will kick his ass. I hope so! Are you jealous? Of course, I do. I have such a nice boyfriend. How can I cheat on you? Really? I am not surprised to see why Nueng hates me. Bank! Why did you tell others story about my dad? Why shouldn't I? I told the truth. What's wrong with that? You don't have the right to talk Surely I do. This is a democratic country. I have my right to say anything. You have to correct all these rumors. I won't! Cannot you accept the truth? You cunt. If you want to be angry, be angry at yourself. It's your problem that you are born a child of fagots. Child of fagots! Why! The sting me. Let's go. Do you think a 18-year-old living by himself will be difficult? Sure it will be. Why do you ask? At this young age, what job can you get? How will you make ends meet? So, I need to find someone else to live with. Don't tell me you want to live by yourself. Why not? You know it. Are you embarrassed that you have a gay dad? I want to run away from here where nobody knows who my dad is. You don't understand how it feels when people see you as a freak. You don't have to care about others. You never beg them for food. You should care about your dad. You are also... like you dad, aren't you? If I can choose, I don't want to be gay like my dad. Do you think being gay is genetic? I don't know. But l don't think it is a bad thing at all. Nueng, are you going out with Nut? I'm going to see a movie with Nut. Do you have enough money? Yes I do. [Real estate advertising board] [Room for rent: 1,800 Baht per month] [Room for rent: 4,500 Baht per month] Nut, this one looks interesting. [Room for rent: 2,000 Baht per month] Let's move in together after I graduate. Sure. Nueng, I'm going home now. Ok. Nut, are you still friend with Nueng? Don't you know his dad is a fagot? Soon he will be just like his dad is. Mom, keep it down, will you? I was telling the truth. Nueng, why are you back so soon? ? Nueng. Yes? Your birthday is approaching. Let's celebrate? No. Is there anything you'd like for your birthday present? Yes. What is it? I want a normal life just like anyone else. Aek! Aek! Whats the matter? This is really really bad! What is it? Tum who resided in building C is dead! Really?! Sure. Let's have a look. Nut my son. You cannot get in there. Let me see my son. Nut! Nut! You cannot get in there. What's going on, Tar? The police suspected that Tum tried to rape Nut at his place because Tum usually flirt with Nut at Auntie Mai's eatery. Nut must have fought back and they both got stabbed in the end. When did they die exactly? Nut's mom told us that Nut had disappeared around 3pm. He might have been killed around that time. I... Nueng. Nueng. Hey Nueng! So I heard that your dad is a fagot. How were you delivered? Did you come out from his ass? Are you gay just like your dad is? I'm asking you. Answer me! Stop picking on him. What's the matter? I'm telling the truth. What's wrong about that? Everyone around here knows. Don't you feel sorry for him? Why should I? You are defending him. So, you're the same as him? Fagot! You cunt! Thank you so much for saving me. It's alright. Don't you disgust me? I've known stories about your dad for a few years. If I do disgust you, I wouldn't have been with you all these times. But after today, I think I only have you as a friend. Don't worry. Even if I am your only friend. But I will be your best one. Then, would you be more than just a friend? If I can only have a friend, I'd like him to be my boyfriend. Would you be my boyfriend? Certainly. Promise, you have to take me out of here. Aek! Aek! What's the matter, Tar? Hold yourself together, ok? Hello! What do you think? Is your son cute? He is adorable. Thank you so much for all these months. Not at all. And where is the mother? Its just two of us. We will be both father and mother for this child. The two of you? A gay couple? Yes. There's no way I will let the child be with you. I shall raise him myself. You can't do this. We had our deal. And the sperm is his. But the womb is mine. How can I let the child be with people like you. I will return all the money to you. We don't want our money back. We want our child. What are you doing? Don't take him away! Hello Mr. Aek. Would you like to correct the past? Who are you? My name is Guy. Nice to meet you. I can help revive your son. Revive? What the hell are you talking about? You can think of it anyway you like, but I can certainly revive your son. However, you don't believe me. I would be glad to just walk away from here. Thank you for believing me. You're the first person in the past 5 years who actually listened to what I had to say. Actually, I still cannot trust you. But I have nothing to lose. Don't worry. I am certainly not a con man. Because I will not ask for any money. So, how can you help my son? I will take you back in time so you can save your son. Time travel? Don't tell me that you've got a time machine. No! We don't need a time machine. And we don't need to jump into a drawer for that. The method we use is to send data from your brain. Send data from the brain? Yes. Let me explain it for you. Your brain is like a server that keeps the data from the past until the present. As time goes by, your brain is holding more and more information. That makes you in the present time know what happened in the past. Then, I will copy all data from your brain up to now. And put these data into your brain in the past. Just like this. Yourself in the past would know what was going to happen. What's left is to let yourself in the past save your son. And the fact that your son is dead would be erased from history. I see. The only condition is that I can only send you back no greater than 24 hours. Now it's 4 pm. So that means... Yes, if we do it now, you will go back to 4 pm yesterday. So, do you want to time travel? Wait. Who are you? Why do you want to help me? I'm just someone with extraordinary power whose hobby is to save peoples lives. And you're just one in millions whom I chose randomly. So, do you want to do it? Ok. Let's give it a try. Don't you need to use some kind of equipment? I'm sorry that my method is a little too simple. Because I'm not a blue cat robot. Alright. Please close your eyes. And then I realized that time travel is real. I have to think carefully what to do next, whether I should try to stop Nueng from committing a suicide. Even if I am successful this time, he might do it again. Because I have not corrected the reason for him to kill himself. Then I realized that what I should do is to save Nut. If Nut was alive, Nueng wouldn't have thought of a suicide. If Nut was killed around this time, I still have some time to save him. Just relax. Stop seeing Nut or I'll fucking kill you. Let's go Nut. Come with me. How did you know that I was in there? Well... never mind. Why did you go there anyway? Tum told me that he owed me money for his meal. And he asked me to collect the money at his room. Thank you so much for saving me. Not at all. You're my son's boyfriend after all. You are so nice and kind. I wish you were my dad. I'm not that good a person. You are just like my other son to me. Then, can I stay over at your place tonight? Sure. No problem at all. Thank you so much. Eh? How come back with Nut? Nueng... What the hell are you doing, dad? I miss you so much, you know? I thought I would never see you again. What are you talking about? We just saw each other this morning. Indeed... Dad. I'll let you guys rest. I will sleep somewhere else. But l think it's ok that you sleep here with us. Is it alright? It's alright. But I don't think it's appropiate. Then, I can sleep outside. Are you going to school? Shouldn't you be back at the eatery already? In a bit. I just want a little chat with your dad. You go. It is late. Is that so? See you later. So, what is it? I'd like to be your boyfriend. Why?! I have always fancied you since 3 years ago. But considering our age difference, I didn't dare to tell you this. The fact that I became Nuengs boyfriend, is because I think I wouldn't be able to see you again if I upset him. Then why are you telling me this now? Because you saved me from Tum. And that made me realized that you are the one I want to be with. Now l just want to follow my heart. But you are Nueng's boyfriend. I will break up with him. You cannot do that. Ever! Go home! Hey. What are you doing? Nut! Nut! Don't. Please don't do this. Stop it, Nut. Stop it, Nut. Don't do this. Nut!! Nueng!!!! Nueng, please listen to me. I can explain this. What kind of a father are you, having affairs with your son's boyfriend! Nueng!!!! Nueng! Stop! Please listen to me! I see. I see. I see. Nueng!!!! Can you analyze what went wrong? Because I saved Nut. And that made him loved me. But if I hadn't saved Nut, Nueng would have committed a suicide. The future offers so many different paths for you to choose. Some are wrong, some are right. Just like a game. If we lose, we won't know what we will see next. But if we play the same game again, we have better chance of winning. I don't get it. What are you trying to tell me? I will send you back in time once more. What? Really? Would you like to take my offer? Certainly. No father in the world would reject this. Even if I have to do this hundreds of times, I will. I will do whatever it takes until I get the best path for my son. Actually, I don't give anyone a second chance. But I will give it to you because you're a good father. Close you eyes. My challenge was, if I saved Nut, he would fall in love with me. But if I didn't save Nut, Nueng would kill himself. The I thought... Why didn't I try to save Nut without letting him know it was me? Have a drink. Who is that? Hold on a second. Yes? Please come to my room. I've got something important to tell you. Just a minute. I have a friend visiting. Let me tell him first. No need. It won't take long. Ok. Let's go. So what is it that you want to tell me? Aek! If you want sex, do it with me but don't see Nut again. Aek! And that's the way to save Nut without letting him know that it was me. In the future, Nut may breakup with Nueng, because he never actually loves Nueng. At least, I can delay the break up for several years. Until that time comes, Nueng might not feel as hurt as he does now. Like? Sure. If you have sex more emotional. Tell me. Promise me. Don't see Nut again. Okay. But can we do it again? You took up a few hours of my time. I guess my friend have already left. I'm sorry about that. Hey! Nut!!! Nueng! Nueng! Nueng! Where are you? Nueng! Nueng! Nueng! Where are you? Nueng! Nueng! Aek. Aek!!! Tar! What's up? Just hold yourself together, ok? The thing is... Nueng... Whats the matter? What happened to Nueng? Tar!!! What happened to Nueng? So the first two time travel attempts were in vain. I was chasing the wrong guy. Tum didn't kill Nut. I shouldn't have believed the police's hypotheses. I walked the wrong path all along. Yes. You chose the wrong path. So what? Could you please send me back in time again? But I already gave you a second chance. I Know I'm asking for too much. But if this is like playing a game just as you said. Then, those were just some practices of an amateur. Please give me one more chance. Mr. Aek!! I don't know if you are a god or a demon. But if helping people is your hobby, that means you are also a good person. And is willing to give people a chance. Please. Just one more chance. Please. Well. You know exactly how to talk me to it. OK. I will send you back in time once more. Seriously? Yes. Thank you very much. Close you eyes. What I want to know the most is what actually happened on that day. What did I do wrong? What did I miss? Just relax. Stop! Let me do it. Then, I knew the truth. There was no rape. It was mutual. Nut was not as naive as I thought. Don't! Who are you?! Why do you have to kill Nut? Because I love him so much. So much that I cannot accept a betrayal. What is it? Do you wanna fuck with me? Just a thousand Baht. What would your boyfriend say if he found out? What boyfriend? We are just friends. Just a pity. So, are you going to bang me? Sure. Get in. I have never experienced anything good since I was born. I never received any love from a mother nor from friends. You are also a reason I got bullied. Even with Nut, the one I trust the most, betrayed me at last. Why did you give me this life? Calm down. Listen to me. No. I won't want to solve any more problems. Nueng!!!! Nueng!!!! Nueng!!!! Nueng!!!! Nueng. Nueng! Nueng! Why do this?? Do not leave me. Nueng! Nueng! So, Nueng didn't kill himself because Nut was killed. But Nueng killed himself. Because his heart was broken. As a father, how come I didn't pick up on this? I think, seeing your son died repeatedly, must be really hurt for parents. Sure it hurts. Because a child's death is like the parent's death. Then, you should just let go. How could I? He's my son. I have to save him no matter what. And that is my responsibility. I am the reason he lacked love. And that made him so desperate for love from others. Mr. Aek. I am a murderer. I killed him. Mr. Aek. I'm begging you. Please give me another chance. Please. Just one more chance to save my son. Please. Please. Mr. Aek. Please. Ok. Swear to me that this will be the last time. I swear. I swear. This will be my last chance. I can give up my own life just to save his. Please. Alright. I will give you this once last chance. Look up. Close you eyes. This is my last bet. Dad!!!! Stop!!! Dad!!!! Nueng. If someone has to die today, let that person be me. I am the reason for all these. Had I been a better father, you would have been happy. All these wouldn't have happened. This is my redemption. Before I die, please promise me one thing. Promise me that you will not hurt yourself and others. Promise me. Promise me that you will live on until you're old. A promise that will cost me my life. Can you do it, son? Dad!!!! I'd be willing to die if that help save yours. Nueng. Promise me. Promise me. I'll take those tears as your promise. Nueng. Promise me. I'm... I love you, son. Dad!!!! Dad!!!! Dad!!!! Are you disappointed that this is not hell nor heaven? How is Nueng? Don't worry. Nueng doesn't think of committing a suicide at all during the past 4 days. So I did it. Yes. You changed his mind. Even I didn't expect you'd do it that way. I believed that, if he sees me dying for him, he would change his mind and fulfill that promise. But the fact that I am still alive is like a miracle. What's greater than a miracle is Nueng has been taking care of you tirelessly all these past few days. Parents try to save their own child with all their might. Thinking that a child is an avatar of themselves. At the same time, a child tries to save his parents. Because a child sees his parents as his other selves. Isn't it ironic? I tried to save Nueng all along. But in the end, it was him who saved me. This is probably what we call a family bond. Nueng. Dad! Dad. Today I won. I paid. Ok!! Good!! But!!! Find some girl for me. Sexy! Nueng!! Child of fagots. Nueng. Mind your own business. Nueng!! What about your father? Fuck! Nueng. Nat!! Let's break up.
