When I say I am 'motion' it's because I'm afraid of standing still. Because... then what? Even thinking about it, inside I am going like 'aaaaah' That's definitely... what scares me. What's going to happen then? Well, maybe only then there will be the answer to 'who am I?' And what happens once you've found everthing you ever wanted? You mean if I stand still? Could you stand still then? Once you've achieved everything or you're absolutely happy. Or would you avoid being really happy... to stay in motion. You look fancy. Thanks. You too. Thanks. How are you? I'm good. And you? I'm good too. Are you excited? Yes. I had an idea. Ok, I already thought you would. Paper. Pen. Ok, I have to draw you. No. I mean you can if you like We will write something down and the other one has to do it. Or we have to do it together. Or 'it' should happen... or I don't know. And then we switch around. Everyone can make a wish. Like 'Truth or Dare'? Yes. Do I start? As you like. Alright. Let's do it. Shall we set the timer? I only got 23 hours and 59 minutes. We already wasted one minute. 1, 2... 3. Your socks stink. I mean your feet. Speaking of: are we allowed to tell intimate details?! Well, maybe it's just the socks? Absolutely. Maybe it's not the socks after all. Maybe it's the air around your feet?! Turn around. Take my hand for 5 minutes. Hold it. Of course I saw right away: 'that's a beautiful woman'. But it was different. I thought: I want to be with this person. Exactly. I want to be with this woman. It was like: ah, there she is. Yes. it was. And it wasn't like: whoooo, nooooow, wooooow. But instead I just knew. It was like: take my hand and I take yours... and off we go. Why do you want me to do that? Why I want you to hold my hand? Although you know that... That what? You can stop at any time. I'm not... forcing you. We could agree on a 'safeword'. Mine is: Willy Brandt. What's yours? I pick Helmut Kohl. Thought so. Why don't you just stay here? What do you mean? Stay here in Berlin. Because I don't want to. But still I have to hold your hand now. I want to hold it now, yes. You can always say 'Helmut Kohl'. I don't want to. Helmut Kohl is fat. What if you came back and I have a family, husband, kid? Let's say, in three years? And how would it be for you... if I send you a family photo in three years? I would be mad at myself that I didn't try to keep you here. Or to... Time is up? I am scared of that moment; that we sit in the kitchen and run out of ideas. Or that we get too comfortable and... we don't want to spar with each other anymore. Or that we have to clock in at 9 and come back at 6 because, I don't know, there might be a kid. Or we needed money. That's what I'm afraid of. Well, yes... it's... Right now everything is just great the way it is. For me it's also super important to conquer the world together. 600 feet? Okay. So, 600 feet, uhm... Downhill? One step is about 3 feet. I'll take small steps, come on! Jump! You have to count! Be careful. Okay, well done. I feel dizzy. Breathe. Are my lips red now? A little. Surprise me. Jesus. Come here. Was that the surprise? Maybe. Now they're gone. Yes. They're going to America. Love... It's an energy. Gratefullness. Dependence. In a way. I don't know. Well, it is a commitment, but... It is a dependence but a nice one, don't you think? But it is still a kind of dependence. When you're connected to someone, you're dependent on each other, too... in a way. You know what? The floor is lava! Oh damn. You won because I hesitated. Fair enough. The floor is lava. 1, 2, 3. Go. Too late. Hey, that was way too... That was too what? I couldn't really prepare for it. Now I am gonna write 'go swimming'. That's too obvious! Wait, wait! You just have to... Shit... No, I have to sit there. Why? Because I have to row. I can row too. No, I'm doing that. The man has to row. What do I have to do? Go, go, go! I can't row! Shit! The wind, uh. Very good. Nobody is watching. Since we met for the first time we saw each other almost every day. Since then we're having one big first date. Are you crazy? Come back right now! Sorry! I thought it's free. Shit. Will you get in already? We're coming! Sorry. Shit. Keep calm. You're so slow. Come here! He can't row. Now he makes me nervous. We thought this was included with the ticket. Stop thinking then. You're making it worse. We're coming. Come, come, come! We stole a boat. Well, he stole one. He is not coming. Who is not coming? The supervisor. I don't get it. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I wanted to go for a swim. I don't get it. What are you guys doing here? We spend our last 24 hours together. Time is running or what? Yes. What? Well, just you know... ask him. Well, I don't know... to say goodbye... To make love one last time? Not really... Honestly, I'm confused. You just split up... Ask him. I just play along. We have to go now. Bye. Yes. Good luck then. You never know. Is everything still intact? Doesn't matter. Just drink from the bottle. Chug, chug, chug! Okay, that's a little too much. I'm so happy for you. When is it happening? It starts in 4 weeks. In 4 weeks, okay. In New York. I will have an exhibition for one year. So you will go there, build it and come back? No, I have to be there full time. God, it's too hot. Yes, sit down. So... Hold on... what does that mean for us? You would be gone for one year? Yes. Okay... wow. One year. Okay. it starts in 4 weeks?! Yes. Well, I could come with you... yes, but I... well... sure. But I won't have much time especially at the beginning. Sure. No. Just to visit some time. Of course. We'll have money and you can come over whenever you want. Okay, long distance relationship for one year. It's really great. It really is. I mean... You really earned it. Absolutely. Awesome. Shall we celebrate? Sure... but I'm not really in the mood right now... Well, I... You just follow later. To New York? Me living in New York? Yes?! No. I can't. Why not? I would love to go there to visit or for a vacation... but I would need something on my own, otherwise it wouldn't work. I will think about it, for sure. But this is about you now and maybe... after one year you don't like it anymore... Sorry. In a relationship it's important for me... That we communicate with noises. For example burping. Communication is important but... I don't know... There is so much... What's really important to me in a relationship is... physicality. If I didn't find you attractive anymore that would be bad. Altough... Highly unlikely. But true. I don't know. Everything is important but nothing in particular comes to mind. For me it's important... to 'walk' together. I don't mind fighting along the way. But it's crucial for me to never stop negotiating. You're pregnant. Just a little bit. Hello. Gongratulations! I'm almost bursting. How far along are you? Eighth or ninth? Yes, in 3 weeks I am basically going to explode. Well, hopefully not. Great! You two look fancy. What are you up to? We are just spending the day looking what's going to happen. Basically an experiment. I am going to New York. With your performances? That's awesome. Congratulations! It really worked out well. I'll leave tomorrow at noon. Ah, crazy. And you are going as well? No... I stay for now. It's better that way. That's why we are spending the day to say goodbye and to do a few things and... Sure. Hello. Beautiful. And she is really strong I tell you. I better be prepared. But it's surely amazing, right? Oh it's absolutely great. Really. It's one of the most beautiful things ever. And daddy is super excited and it is connecting us in a new way... Do you live together already? Oh yes, we live together. It just makes the relationship even more beautiful. Alright. Have a great day. All the best for you. That's, uhm... I guess we have other priorities right now. Sure it would work somehow if I got pregnant unplanned... But, uhm... I... we don't have... I don't see myself as a mother. It's not at all an issue right now. Do I have to open that? 'Dance with me on the Devil's Hill'. You want to go in there? Yes. We get you something nice to wear. Sometimes it bothers me that... I like to have direct access, especially to her. There's a wall? Yes. Sometimes she tends to be like... I don't know. Of course it also shows strength and charisma. But I'm more interested in what's behind all that. And sometimes I get frustrated, if there is a wall. Do you remember Dave? He did this one show with us. What about him? We made out once. The last three weeks? Or in general? No, one year ago. One year ago? When he was here. And I did it because I was so annoyed with you... needing to know everything and being in control. It's always the same: You did it, because I did something. Will you ever take responsibility? No. You cheated on me because I did something! You are crazy. You know what really bothers me? What? Basically since the beginning. That I always got the feeling that I have to push and pull you. And you are always the one who nags and says 'I don't know'. I am not nagging! Besides, this was your idea and I... it is not just the idea, it is about the principal. In general I always feel like... I have to push you to do something. Honestly I didn't want to see you today. I don't want to spend 24 hours with you to celebrate the end. Okay, then just decide to not see me. I'm not forcing you. I can't. You are always playing the victim. That's not true. Say either yes or no to something. You alway accuse me in the end. I don't get it. Just do something. You are always doing something anywhere. You say 'let's write a note' or 'go here or there' or 'jump into the water'. That's childish. You are ridiculous. You pretend that everything's okay. You dress up nicely because we see each other one last time. Because that's 'so wonderful'. And you try to cover it up with stupid tasks. If you don't like it, why are you even here? Just leave. Maybe I gotta tell you something important. So tell me. No. I won't say anything now just because you tell me to say it. I want to be... on my own in New York for the first few weeks. Maybe even the first 3 or 4 months. I wish you would do something. To fight for you? I don't know. You just endure everything and pretend everything is fine. And then? Then what? New York, ah, difficult. I don't know. But being here is also difficult. And staying together as well. So, what's your decision other then "enduring" it? I have no idea. It's not that... I can't do anything about it, and I don't want to do anything... because I understand you. And probably, because I love you. I love you too. I would like to make a decision with you. Then I'd say, we split up. Okay. Do you feel sorry for yourself? No. I feel sorry about us. I think that's not enough. Oh, should I rather scream, or make a big scene? Should I throw your stuff out of the window and jump from the balcony? Or should I drown myself or cut my wrists open? Would that suit you? Yes. No! No way! I was joking! I wouldn't do it anyway. Maybe you can come visit after a while? I don't think so. That's your thing now... and everything you'll experience will be your memories. And if you come back, maybe we'll meet again. Sometimes I wished you would cheat so that something happens. You were always like: 'yeah, let's do that' and 'Yes, sure...' You have no idea how often I... I know, but I couldn't act any other way. You were doing your thing and I had to do mine. There was no other way. There can't be two people like you. You were like that, and I had to be like I was. I would have loved to be different but that's not me then. I'm not like you. And I can't pretend and I don't want to. I used to like it, when you did something you loved. Okay, I was annoyed by you always talking... and sometimes you were so passionate and I seemed to be a total bore next to you. But wasn't it also complementary? But I can't change, I don't want to. But I can't change, I don't want to. I don't want to go to New York. I don't want to go to New York. And I don't want to be the little 'wife' at your side, Because that would be exactly what's already happened between us. That I have nothing but you. That music sucks. Shall we continue? Would you ever consider couples therapy? Yes. Really? Yes. super interesting. But isn't that... When I tell you that you're doing something a certain way, then you say 'but you do this' and we go back and forth. But if there is someone who mirrors the relationship this person would probably say: 'yes, I see your point but you have to consider that'... No one would say 'you are right' and 'you are wrong'. Yes. Should I try that? Would be interesting to have a 'supervisor' once a month. A relationship supervisor. But I don't think we need that because we are really good in... A lot. Two things. Or one thing. Your eyes. Your anger. My anger? But I am such a nice person. Your lethargy. Your humor. The way you laugh. Making love to you. To kiss you. To wake up next to you. To tell you my stories. To listen to you. Your mother. Stay back. You can always say 'Helmut Kohl'. I didn't really think about him right now... Honestly, I would say 'penis'. I would just say a silly word. Just so it's not that melodramatic. I think when you're about to say your last word, you can absolutely use a little pathos. Fart. No, I can't... no pathos please. That's his style: pathos. No. I would prank you. I would be like: What I always wanted to tell you... Greta just convinced me a little bit. Right?! Sorry, that 'yes' was strange! So, what could you say... that makes sense? That's not possible! No word could express how we feel for each other or what we would want to say to each other. No word. No sentence. Shit. I'm pregnant. I'm looking forward to it. And I want to keep it. I am 4 months pregnant and everything looks good. What? 4 months? Why didn't you say something earlier? I couldn't. I'm sorry. Not that I'm going to be a father but how it all went down between us. It feels great to finally say it. I thought about not telling you at all. I'm looking forward to it! Really? Yes. Is it going to be a boy? For sure. Your gender will succeed. I... It's okay. How crazy would it be, if you lie on your death bed and you think: 'I did not travel the world?' Who kept me from doing it? Yes. How did I miss that? And why did we not see the world although we lived there? But then again there's the big question: can't you find all the important things at home as well? Probably. Could you give me a cherry? When I do, will you stay here? Give me that cherry. Did you just spit on me? There are more floors. Yes. But let's start here. Awesome. You gotta join. What? Do it with me! What should I do? Here? Work out! It says I already lost 0.4 calories. Does yours say anything? We have to lose 10 calories. Whoever is first, wins. Ouch! I already lost 0.4 calories. Shit, that's not even true. Hurry, you gotta lose 10 calories! You are behind, come on! I feel like 'Mr. Bean'! I'm exhausted. Is that bad for your knee? Maybe I should stop now. I won. Yes. Working out is tricky. Who is childish now? The floor is lava. Three, two, one. Ouch. Did you hurt yourself? Nope. Lava-land. What? You can't always do one after the other. You have to wait a little. Not really, no. I am pregnant, I'm not that fast anymore. I like that fellow. If you were an animal, you would be a bird. Could you take a picture? This will be the first picture I show to our son 'Rüdiger'. Wolfgang-Rüdiger. Step forward and stay sideways. No. Make a step towards the window. Exactly. Turn more towards the wall. Turn your eyes towards me and look a little silly. Meaning, just stay as you are. Do that: Do I always tell you what to do? I am an asshole. Yes. Absolutely. And I always fall for it. I always tell you 'do that, and do it that way'? Honestly? Yes, but... I'm sorry. That's terrible. Well... Nevertheless it worked between us most of the time, right? At the end of the day, not really. Well, I would describe it as being at peace. Because standing still sounds rather negative to me. But I like the thought of being at peace with myself and to know who I am and what I have. In the end everything is in motion. It's physics. True. Nevertheless you can stay somewhere like a tree for example. The earth continues to rotate but the tree stays in the same place, maybe for 100 years or longer and witnesses all the stuff happening around it. For example those giant redwoods in North America, and elsewhere. Some are more than 500 years old. I always wonder what they must have seen. All the wars, the native tribes. All the history that passed by such a tree. Truly fascinating. For me that's a beautiful idea: Everything around the tree moves and it grows and moves too. Everything around the tree moves and it grows and moves too. But nevertheless it stays in one place. But nevertheless it stays in one place. So, you are the tree. Well, maybe. One day. I'm not there yet. And you are the squirrel. Or a tzetze fly. That infects everyone. Thanks for bringing me here. Oops, I missed. Oh, we have to dance. On the roof, right? Yes. Sorry. Thanks. You're so brave. Now you're taller than me. I know. Damn. Let's go. Maybe like that? Did we ever dance together? Maybe when we were drunk. One time we danced, One time we danced, when we were hammered and started to throw cups at each other. When we were hammered and started to throw cups at each other. Oh yes. That was hot. Could we do that again? Well, I don't know... I have to go to New York. So I can't. I see. Sure. What are you going to do in New York? I don't know... Some sort of performance. I'll make lots of money and meet cool people. I want to spin too. Fair enough but let me spin you. You are somehow different now. I would like to sleep with you. Is that a sign now? That's the bad conscience. Yours? Sure. No. Go on. Bite it. Really? Childish, right? Can you bit it? For real this time? Sorry. Strange, that one thinks that's funny. I don't. Ha! You missed. Lava-land! What? That was really hard! And you count way too fast! Come on! You had enough time. Okay. The floor is lava! What? Would you still kiss me, when I am 80? Lava-land. 1, 2... Please no! I CAN'T! 3. I can't jump on a car. I don't have the guts. I trust you because I decided to open up to you. And so far it felt really good. I didn't get hurt and I feel like I went in the right direction. Similar to Greta I think... it's a decision. Definitely. But also... Maybe it's like with love: either love is there or not. The same with trust. When I saw her I thought: 'Okay. That's the real deal.' In past relationships I was mostly thinking: 'Is that it? Or is there something better?' A or B, what's better? Pros and cons. But since I saw her, there's no longer any doubt. And that really is a huge gift. Do you know how much time is left? 7 hours. 7 hours. Shall we go home? You can also sleep at your mom's again. Your choice. How do I know that I love you? Maybe if you wake up with a smile and... you love to turn around to see the other one. Because in that moment you're still in a subconscious mode. It changes the more you wake up. I think if you love waking up next to someone, that's a good sign. Or you wake up in the middle of the night and think: There's someone next to me who I really like. Sometimes I forget that you are next to me and then I wake up and think... I don't mean it in a cheesy way. It's just... every single time I am happy that you're there. It's over. We messed up. In the last hours. I want to sleep some more and later I'll make you coffee... I'll stay. What? I'll stay. In bed? I want you to go. I'll go and make some coffee, okay? Toothbrush. Toothbrush. Very important. I would use hers. Great. So, one toothbrush. Now you have to pick something that I can use too. A knife. I can use that too. Fuck. I always pick stuff for both of us. I still have three. So, now you. If you're on an island... Oh, I know now. I once read a book about a guy who is stranded on an island and the only thing he has is a deck of cards. He starts talking to the characters on the cards. Then he starts dreaming about these characters and at some point they start to become 'real'. And he just lives 'with them' on the island. So, I'd take a deck of cards with me to see if that works. I like it. Or you could bring... a non-fiction book like Stefan Zweig's 'Chess Novella', where the 'hero' spends 30 years in prison with only a chess book. And when he gets out he is a chess expert. So I'll take: a deck of cards. And a chess book. But the guy in the book went crazy, didn't he? Yes. Oh, music. Music would be a must. You have your three items. I have one left. My third one would be... to take NOTHING with me. Oh boy, so typical. 'I only live from...' Oh well. I bring you along. I'm already there. I'm there.
