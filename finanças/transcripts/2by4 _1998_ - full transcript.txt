Lost on a lonely road I wander, I've wandered far but can't get near, near to what I seek. 200 moons ago I thought I'd get to see the sun, but still I wander. This road is closing in. My soul is getting tired. Even though I'm young of age, I haven't time to spare. I make into a weeping willow on a bald hill side. Oh wait, I see a glimmer, a glimmer up ahead. Maybe it's the rose I hunger for, as I wander on, wander on. You didn't write that! For fuck' sake, he did. Look lads, he's not going to come tonight, right? So just fuckin' head off.
