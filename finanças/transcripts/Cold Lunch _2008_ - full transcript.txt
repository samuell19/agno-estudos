Prologue No. Somebody saw us. - We could risk it. - I saw someone in the window. - I wasn't driving that fast. - No. Just when everything had started going my way. - Do you have a driver's license? - Yes. - But no car? - No, I don't need one in town. Of course not. And since you don't have kids... - 21 days. - What? That isn't so bad. For drunk driving. No. No, that isn't so bad. But I need my license. You haven't had as much to drink as I have. Haven't I always treated you well? - Yes, we've worked well together. - You could do worse. - I have also been drinking. - You won't regret it. I'm sorry, Marius. I'll testify on your behalf. He swerved straight into the street. We'll wait here. Talk to the police. We may have to go to the station for a couple of hours, but... 21 days! Christ! I'll pay you, of course. I take care of my employees. You aren't young anymore, Turid. There are always new employees. I'm sorry, Marius. - You could go see how he is. - That man? Can't you go see how he's doing? Hey. Are you all right? Hey! Thank you. COLD LUNCH ...space weather is the effect the sun has on our solar system. Specifically our atmosphere and our magnetosphere. This invisible shield that protects us from particles emanating... - Have you had bowel movements today? - Yes. - Solid and abundant? - Yes, father. Splendid! We are in excellent health. Christer? Christer? Christer? Anything you want? Want me to make you something? I have to go to the laundry room, then I'll make you coffee. If you want, that is. 1. Some minor problems arise Shit! Shit! Did you switch off the main fuse? The machine got stuck, so I... - Did you switch off the main fuse? - Yes. - You can't do that. - You can switch it back on now. We'll need an electrician to get that started again. Are you one of Lismoen's tenants? What? No. - Our machine was broken. - You don't even live here? No. I live in number 12. Next door. Then you aren't allowed to be here. I'm leaving. What about the washing machine? Someone has to take responsibility. Well, I'm leaving now. Who do you think will have to fix this? I will. I'll have to clean up your mess. Did you think of that? Someone switched off the main fuse and blew the whole circuit. He pulled out the main fuse to turn off the washer. Some people... Hold this. I told him off, so it won't happen again. It's broken, isn't it? He'll pay for this. He was one of those tenants in number 12. It sure seems broken. Mr. Farsethås, is everything all right? Mr. Farsethås? - Mr. Farsethås? - Does he have a pulse? Check further down. Further down. On his neck. His neck. You do it. We should probably try CPR. - I think he's dead. - Sure, but we can try? - We should call someone. - I'll do it. - Someone should wait here. - Of course. - Will you be back? - Of course. Hi. I washed my cash. - Do you need the bathroom? - Your rent is due tomorrow. I forgot all about that. I'll deposit it today. You'll have it by tomorrow. I'm tired of waiting. I need that money now. We're talking one day, Bjørn Olav. Listen, let me give you 2000 now. - And I'll deposit the rest later. - I need all of it. You expect me to walk around broke? I refuse to argue with you. Here. This isn't enough. You're 1700 short. - Give me a couple of days. - You have to move out. What do you want me to do? Pay your rent on time. We're supposed to be friends. I've been busy. Give me two days, and I'll fix everything. OK? Two days. Good morning! Your clothes are on the chair. Ready for breakfast? - I have to get to work. - You have to eat! I eat too much. Where are my pants? I hung them on the chair. - Where are my new jeans? - They're still wet. But I need my jeans. The dryer just stopped. It's important to look good. That's half my job. - You don't understand that. - I know it's important. - The dryer just stopped. - I don't care. I want my clothes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I apologize. I'm very sorry about this. Bygones. - I'm sorry. - Forget about it. I'm such a klutz. I'm hopeless. You know that. - I know it's important to you. - It's all right. I'm so clumsy. I screw everything up. I'll pull myself together. It's so irritating when things aren't right. I'll make a... Yes, she's so stupid. Mommy is so stupid. 2: The problems grow (but still no cause for concern) It's just that suddenly I have to pay my rent. - Just a few thousand, Margaret. - I paid you a few days ago. Do you have any more Robin Day chairs? Preferably black. You'll have to check down there. I'm not sure. I'm asking for a tiny advance. Just a few thousand. I pay you at the end of each month. I could lose my apartment, Margaret. - Don't you have any black ones? - Not if they aren't over there. - I'd really like a black one. - OK. - Then I quit! - OK. We'll take this one. But 900 is a bit much, since we really wanted a black one. I don't need your money. You can keep it! You have no imagination, and you don't even realize it! I'm sick and tired of working at this flea market! 900 kroner. Do you think I need you? Well, I don't! I want nothing to do with you. Goodbye! Hello? Hello? Hi? Hi. - Do you live here? - Yes. I'm from Major Real Estate. I'm supposed to sell this apartment. Are those your things in that room? The radio is mine. The clothes, and two of the books. The other books are my father's. But the little dictionary and the book about Mr. Kling are mine. Was Farsethås your father? Yes. My condolences. Anyway, Farsethås' contract expired when he passed away. The owner of the apartment has asked us to sell it. So I'm here to look it over. An appraiser will be by later today. We're showing the apartment in a couple of days. Excuse me. It's Odd. That apartment on Vibe Street... Can you check Farsethås' contract? There's a lady living here. His daughter lives here. It isn't my problem! I refuse to take the heat if this drags out. We're shooting for Saturday. OK. Bye. We will give you a few days to pack your things, of course. Is there anyone I can call for you? You have to pack. Pack what? - All your things. - I don't have very many things. The apartment must be empty for the showing. I'm sure you understand. Do you understand? I'm selling the apartment this coming weekend. So you have to start packing. Hi, Einar. No problem. Not at all. You have nothing to worry about. No, I just called Bjørn to check the contract on Vibe Street. I didn't have it here. No problem. You have nothing to worry about. Of course! - Have you finished packing? - Yes. Then...you can leave. Yes. - Could I have your keys? - I don't have any keys. Best of luck. I'm in a hurry here, so... You have to leave now. Goodbye. Good luck. I have spent enough time on you now. Want to relieve yourself now? Then we won't have to interrupt the meal. Let me know if you have to go. Now let's find your dress. Anyway, Farsethås' funeral is on Saturday. I have to attend. You may not want to. Funerals make you so sad. Did you know that the restaurant on the corner is expanding? The grand opening is on Friday. Would you like to go? It isn't that expensive. Tonight we're having soup first, then turkey. I can't vouch for the turkey, - because that recipe doesn't always work. But the soup is good. It would take a lot to ruin that. There we go. You look comfortable now. You look lovely. Need anything? Don't you worry about that funeral. If you don't want to go, you don't have to. Forget about it. I think this soup will be delicious. I've made it so many times before. But, like I say, I can't vouch for the turkey. Go ahead and eat. Eat, eat, eat. There's more where that came from. But don't forget to save room for the turkey. Yum-yum! Please don't. Please don't do that, Karin. Karin, please don't do that now. Don't worry about it. Anyone can have a little accident. Hang on. We'll just go out and change. And everything will be back on track. Five minutes, and we'll be back. Anyone can have an accident. Five minutes, and we'll be back! 3. More of the same Bjørn Olav? Bjørn Olav! What is the meaning of this? Bjørn Olav! This is ridiculous! Bjørn Olav! Bjørn Olav? Open the door. - I'm going to find a new roommate. - Give me a break! Let me in. This is pretty impractical for me right now, Bjørn Olav. - Give me until tonight. - I probably won't find anyone today. - Can I put my things back inside? - No. OK. Fine. Tonight it is. - Bye! - Bye. Christ! I didn't see you. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry... What was your name again? Leni. Right. That's right. You came with Pål, didn't you? Maybe. The apartment I lived in is being sold. Really? - You're looking for a place to stay? - Yes. - Breakfast? - No. I have to go. Bye. I have a girlfriend who just got divorced. She'd like a roommate. If you need a place to stay, I can call her. Yes. It's just down the street. Sorry. I apologize. I didn't mean to scare you. Just a minute... I lost my keys yesterday, and no one was home. - This is my storage room. - Where would you like that? I'll admit it got a little late last night. Could I have some privacy, please? Just give me two minutes. Excuse me. May I help you? - Were you looking for something? - 7C Vibe Street. But I found it. - I'm meeting someone there at five. - It's only ten of four. Would you like to have a seat? Come in. Coffee? Something to eat? - Do you have sandwiches? - Yes. - Anything to drink? - Do you have tea? Regular, black tea? Regular tea. One moment. Here you go. Is everything all right? Do you want the check? - No. - You forgot your bill. You have to pay! 4. New opportunities arise Here you go. - Did it go well? - 24 Vibe St. Across from the store. This has been a real miserable day. - Didn't anyone come? - All they do is look. It's hard right now. - Things will pick up. - In here! - That's a one-way street! - No one will stop you. It's illegal. Stop here. Can Johannes and I go home for an hour or so? I haven't eaten, and Johannes needs to breastfeed. - I get my license back in one month. - I'm aware of that. You said you'd help me. Otherwise I'd have worked out something else. No, I can wait. I can wait. I can understand if it's a little overwhelming for you. It's a lot for you too. I just wanted to go home for a few minutes. - You could call me when you're done. - Maybe we both need a vacation. That sounds nice. I'm so busy with work and you have Johannes... You've been working so hard. Business will pick up. - It isn't easy to start a new job. - You'll do fine. You just have to learn the ropes. I talked to a colleague who is renting out his apartment. I could concentrate on my career and you could focus on Johannes. Maybe that would be good, for a while? And then we could see... how things develop. - What do you mean, "develop"? - See how things...develop. You've been under a lot of pressure. And Johannes wasn't exactly planned. Everything has happened so fast. That was well said. That's what I should have said. That it's all gone so fast. Maybe we could both use a little break? Then it's a deal. We'll take a break for a few months. - You are ungrateful. - Huh? You are ungrateful! Heidi! Heidi? That's enough, Johannes. Hang on. There you go. That's better. Want some more? Good boy. Yes, that's a good boy. Let's wrestle! Come here. - I'm sorry. - Don't say that. - I apologize for what I said. - Don't say that. Don't comfort me. - Don't get mad! - I'm not mad. You're too nice, Odd. You're too nice, and too patient. - I am so ashamed. - Forget about it. Of course you deserve a break, Odd. You've been under so much pressure. Let's not talk about that anymore. OK? Drink this. - I didn't mean to scare you. - I don't have any money. Anything I can do for you? I'm a little hungry. What would you like? A sandwich. But I'd prefer to make it myself. - What is wrong with our sandwiches? - They don't taste good. After you. Just for a few weeks, Erlend. I'd really appreciate it. I know you don't have much money, but you're my last chance. - It's only for a couple of weeks. - I've got money. So you can lend me 1700? I can lend you lots more than that. Come aboard. I need to find a spot without gull poo all over. There are so many gulls everywhere. Help yourself. I really do appreciate it, Erlend. - We should go out some night. - I leave on Friday. I'm sailing this boat to the Caribbean, for the owner. - That sounds great. - It is great. But no one ever does it. They just say, "That sounds great." "I'll do it once I finish school." "Once the kids are old enough." "Once the kids move out." "Once I retire." And then they die. That's what happens. People die. So you leave on Friday? Yes. Me and two others. This weird girl, and Per. We have one spot left. And that spot is... for you. - Thanks, but no thanks. - I'm sure you have lots of projects. - Yes. All I need is some capital. - You still have that café dream? Same idea, but I've changed the concept a little. You'll be broke within six months. You know you'll fail. You know that. - That's why you should come with me. - Thanks, but I can't. - Do you have the money? - Go home and pack. - Do you have 1700 to lend me? - I could lend you 17,000. Could I have it now? Give me your account number. I'll pay you back. I'm not lending you any money. - You'll just waste it. - You said you would! I don't want to. You shouldn't borrow money. You should go home and pack. - Don't forget warm woolens. - I need that money, Erlend! - Christer... - I don't have anyone else to turn to. Go home and pack. You can go to hell, Erlend! See you on Friday. Don't forget to see a doctor. Get the right shots. And remember your passport. Check that it hasn't expired. Friday at noon! 4. Something almost unexpected occurs I would like to propose a toast... Thank you. Wow. Everything OK? Want me to teach you to make something else? Not today, but some other day? No. Pastrami! Excuse me. Thank you. Turid? Turid! - Your door was open. - Yes... We're going to the beach. Care to join us? Give me ten minutes. I'm sorry, but I have to go. That thing we talked about yesterday... What? 2000. - I have someone waiting for me. - We agreed on 2000. - I bought you dinner and drinks. - Yes. - I don't have time for this. - We agreed... Get dressed, and leave. I had a lovely time last night. But I want you to leave now. They are waiting for me. Are you going to give me more trouble? No? Good! I'm too tired. I've been up since 5:30 this morning. I'm too tired. I can't breathe. - Not in my butt, Odd. - Lie still. Not in my butt! I didn't know there would be so many choices. I was planning on going to the beach. 5. Paradise regained - Hi, dad. - Hi. Come in. - Am I very late? - No. No problem. Come in. Have a seat. - Is it freshly baked? - Of course. - You've lost a lot of weight. - I've been busy. - Busy reading? - Lots of lectures. Here. There you go. I don't have much at the moment. Don't worry about it. - Take it, Christer. - That won't solve my problems. - Are you in trouble? - No. I need money. - For anything in particular? - No. Many students take jobs on the side. You have no idea how much I have to read. No, I don't. - It's fucking intense. - Don't use that language. You haven't quit school, have you? - You've been studying so long. - You think I'm lying to you? No, I wouldn't. I just wanted to talk to you. I don't need your money. You can keep that. - I don't have much. - Keep your money. The expenses have piled up, especially since your mother died. Don't worry about it. Want to look at old pictures? I found some in the basement. When the basement flooded, I found this old cardboard box. It was full of great pictures. Your mother and I never got around to making albums. We considered it, but kept postponing it. There are a lot here. We can select some for an album. Here's you and Beaner. Look. You were horseback riding. And look at this. Remember Ann Kristin? She was beautiful. She had a crush on you. And here's your mother. Poor mother. Pictures sure are fun. They bring you right back. Everything is fine. Although he's teething now. Great. He's just starting up, but he's doing a great job. Yes. Long hours. He was so busy for a while that we considered living apart. But that never happened. It's nicer to live together. No, everything is great. I mean, who wants to be alone? No one wants to be alone. Hang on. I have to calm down Johannes. Really? That would be great! Next weekend? No, that won't work. I can't go on a girls' trip now. Maybe in six months. Sure, but Johannes is still a baby. And Odd works so much. And he needs someone too. He needs me too. Of course I want to. That's not the point. I just can't right now, because the two of us are so busy. Maybe next year. Things will be easier then. So don't forget about me. None of that, you know, out of sight, out of mind...
