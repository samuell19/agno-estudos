The kids called him "the Snot". Vangelis the "Snot". The cat strangler. We've been sitting at the same desk since first grade. We're best friends. While his eyes tried to catch mine... I knew what was going through his head. He was going to make a break for the window like last year. If he gets hit again he won't just stand there. He'll run for it. He won't ever learn division. It's time. The bell's got to ring any second. We made each other look pretty bad... bet we won't be talking after this. School's over... and the plans we made for sling-shooting... and for stoning the Anthillers are down the drain. Why don't you eat something? What's got into you? Mother was saying that this summer... she'd take me with her to the trees. I was grown up, she said... and had to help her cut the bark of the gum tree. The teacher told us not to lie around in the sun like hounds, but to help our parents in the cutting. School would open again and he'd catch up... with whoever hadn't listened to him. Sorry you don't pass. Better luck next year. Immigrant! Come! Come with me! The "Immigrant". The other kids called him Panayotis. They said he looked just like his owner Panayotis... a hunter from the next village. I called him the immigrant because last summer... he got away from the hunter and came to our village. When the hunting season started again... his owner found him and took him back. What is it? What's the matter? Go rest awhile. Where have you been? Where did you go? Hello! - Hello. Did you catch any birds? - Sure. Look! Clouds, shit and kids... you can't touch'em. Come on uncle. I want to get in. Didn't I tell you you're not supposed to get into the... water while you're sweating! Did anyone else get in? Don't make me say it again. Show some respect. He wanted to get in by himself. - Well, how about it? Shall we get in? - And why not? On your feet children. - Is she gone? - Yes, I saw her go up the street. He told me that an old woman had given him this cat to get rid of. It had eaten all her chicks. She'd payed him... but he wouldn't do it. It was wrong of them to call him the cat strangler. He had built a bamboo hut to keep all his orphan animals. There's my house. He'd go there to get away from his mother... cause he didn't want to sleep in the afternoon... and he wasn't going to help her cut the bark anymore. The teacher had left the village... and we had nothing to worry about. We wouldn't go to church on Sundays any more. He showed me the coins he had saved in his hiding place. He got them by holding the cross at funerals. He'd even run off to the other villages... when he heard church bells ringing for the dead. Hey kid, will you give me the incense burner? No. Hey kid, I'll give you the cross and ten drachmas for it, okay? He was sure that the heat would kill off... a lot of old people and we'd get plenty of coins. I told him about the tree... and the reservoir hidden in the valley. We'd go there the next day in the afternoon... when the yard had gone. We swore to take the immigrant... and hide him there so that the hunter would never find him. Let's go down there to the water. Look, a lamp. Let's see who can hit it. There, there's a tree. You too? Must be the plums. - Hot today. - Yes sir, very hot. The sun's cooked us. A temporary alliance against the Anthillers. - One, two, three! How many? - Three. - One, two, three! How many? - Three. Jump on them if they're too cold to eat! Wasps! It's just a sting, it'll go away, don't cry. Stop it mother, please! Leave me alone! You ruined the game! You ruined it! Welcome! Come in, come in... Step back... Look here please. Ready? The birdie! - And what is the edge? - Edge, bayonet, net! - Who knows? - You know! You know! Is this life? Yes! What can I do? So many are the drowned... in the depths of the sea. Come here, come here... and have a slap or two! Come along and don't you wander off again! Goodbye. Have a good trip. Well, now that the summer's over... let's see what you remember from last year.What is the capital of Greece? Turkey!
