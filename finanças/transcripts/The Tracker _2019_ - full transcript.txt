The day I turned ten, my father took me hunting for the first time. It was his way of telling me that soon I would be grown up, his way to teach me about life. I followed him in silence, fully aware that once I fired his rifle, the innocence of childhood would be no more. He was not in a hurry to kill an animal. But first, he wanted me to understand the difference between being a hunter and being a tracker. The hunter kills its prey. The tracker understands it. He blends with nature, feels its power, hears its call. Tracking is a sacred responsibility. It finds its origin in the origin of mankind. A tracker preserves history. A hunter destroys it. But then comes the moment when both become one. That's when he told me, "This is what it means to be a man." Hakansson, we have your wife and daughter. Half a million, if you want to see them alive. Tonight at 11:00, Route 39, kilometer 28. You alone, no police. No police. You understand? Get in. Where are you taking us? Let me go. Let me go. Get in the car. Help. Help! I feel bad. Help me! Oh! Don't worry, baby. Everything will be all right. We are going to see Daddy soon. The prisoner escaped. Okay, we're on it. Move, boys. Go! Mummy! Mummy! No. Mummy! Mummy! No! Did you find them? Yeah. We found them this morning. Where are they? I'm sorry. Mr. Hakansson, it's Detective Laterza. I have to see you. I have information regarding your family. Meet me at Cafe La Piazzetta in Taranto, Wednesday at 4:00 p.m. Okay. Almost there. About an hour or so? Hey, be honest. How excited are you that we're about to go live in a small town in southern Italy for two or three years? Very excited. Really? Yeah. Okay. Mister Ha-kan-sson. That's right. I'm glad you made it. - A long flight from L.A. - Yeah. Right? Yes. I have all the billing information I need. Do you want me to show you around? It's a very nice place. It's okay.Okay. Just the key, please.Sure. This is your key. Thanks a lot. Call me if you have any problem. All right. You can call me when you want. I will. Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye.Thanks. You all right? Yeah. Whew. Wow. Okay. You okay? Yeah. Nice, huh? Yeah. I gotta sit down. Not bad. I love it. I think I could live here for a while. Yeah. Are you not gonna help unpack for the tired pregnant woman? I have to carry the babies and give birth to them. Thanks for coming with me. Thought you could just knock me up and leave me with these two little guys? Boys? You sure? Is that what you want? It doesn't matter. I mean, as long as they're... Yours. No. As long as they're healthy. And mine. San Gallo, I'll miss it. No. You'll be way happier where I'm taking you. One gets fond of places... of people. It's not worth it. We conquered this place. But it never welcomed us. Giordano is going to betray us. Do you want me to... Yes. Yes. May I? Come in. I'm Commissioner Graziani. I have a meeting with Detective Giordano. He's not here. Can't you ask someone else, perhaps? Thank you. Sartori? Yes, he's here. Just a minute.Thanks. Leotrim. Commissario Giordano. Don't be nervous. Nobody can hear us. I don't trust fish, if you ask me. Well, you can trust me, Gudon Leotrim. Don't worry. I'm not planning to shoot a police officer, at least not today. Aren't you forgetting something? Lupo will get his next shipment 2:00 a.m. on Wednesday. By land, not by sea. By land? Trucks. What do you suggest? Wait, they process it, and you ship it out. I might just do that. I will live with that. That makes the two of us. Good. Are you comfortable? Graziani? From Torino? Yes, sir. Follow me. This is your office. And what's with the stuff? Training. That's called training. Two or three years in a place like this, and you go back home with a good promotion. This is your plan, right? Actually, no. Excuse me, are you mad at me, by any chance? Yes. Welcome to Taranto. Good work. Go fuck yours... Excuse me? No, I mean, "Go for it." What a great start. He didn't move. Bye. Bye, man. I'm sorry, sir. We're closing. Excuse me. Um... Do you happen to know a Detective Laterza? Is that who you were waiting for? Yeah. He committed suicide four days ago. Are you sure? I'm sorry. Okay. Do you know where he lived? The last house on the street. Hey. There he is. Ciao, love. Oh, you look exhausted. I am. You can't imagine the day I had today. That bad? Did you solve a big case? Wanna see my battle wounds? Yeah.Yeah. Okay. Look. Look at that. No gunshots here. Look at this. Mm-hmm... I think this is a paper cut. And there's a carpal tunnel here. Paperwork. What are you reading? All right, listen to this. "April is the cruelest month, breeding, Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing, Memory and desire, stirring, Dull roots with spring rain." Does he know who you are? He's dead. And has been for a long time. He's writing about the month of April. I'm happy he's dead. I want our kids to know good poetry. That's why you married a cop. A jealous cop. Close your eyes. Why? I'm gonna make you happy. Hmm. Close them. Okay. It's not gonna hurt, right? No. Open. Drink it quietly. I am going to bed. Thank you. Did I ever tell you that I love you? Yes, I know. What are you doing? Why are you following me, huh? Why? Why are you following me? Huh? I don't understand you. Why? Who are... Signore. Excuse me, where's the police? Police? This way? Graziani! Graziani! Yes, I'm coming. Do you speak English? Yes. Come, come. Mister Hakansson, an old friend. Graziani. Ask him why he came back to our city. He would like to know why you came back in our city. Because Detective Laterza called me and said he had some news about the kidnapping. Laterza committed suicide. He says that he went crazy and started believing in conspiracy theories. And he started reopening a whole bunch of cases, including yours. So why did this kid pull a gun on me today? Who? This young guy, a 20-year-old guy, pulled a gun on me. He says he was probably trying to rob you. He thinks that your case is unsolved, and it's impossible to close it. Can I speak to Detective Giordano? He was the one who had my case originally. Giordano? Giordano took a couple of days off. He says that he knows how you feel, but he can't do anything for you. He says that he has your fingerprints on an illegal gun. It's not good, and you should leave. I'm sorry. Thanks. Nice to meet you. Would you tell me what the fuck is going on? Ten years ago, they killed his wife and daughter. So he comes back after ten years, and we do nothing to help him? Graziani. We didn't manage to close the case ten years ago. You think you can solve it now? Who do you think you are? Sherlock Holmes? Go back to work. Yeah, I get it, but the poor guy... Shit. Hey, honey. Hey. Smells delicious. Another exciting day at the office? Kind of. I learned how to cook a new dish. Oh, my God. Should I start worrying? No. Are you coming? Yeah. Yeah, give me a second. Hey. You want water? Yeah, thank you. Hey.Hi. Did he see you? I asked if he saw you. I beg you, Lupo. What are you begging me for? Certainly you don't think I'm going to kill you? You are like a son to me. One who failed, but still, a son. Hey, are you all right? What the fuck? Yeah? Okay. Yes. Honey. What's happening? I'm sorry, honey. It's something I have to do, okay? I gotta go. Take this. There's the new guy. New commissioner? Antonio Graziani, a pleasure. Giordano. What a mess. Where do we start from? Yeah, where do we start from? Excuse me, who did you rent it to? He was about 50, a foreigner. Hakansson. Yeah, okay, but what do I do now? Call the insurance company. Call the what? What now? Now it's war. Psst. Psst! Good evening. Sorry for the late hour. We're looking for a thief. I didn't hear anything. All right. Call me if you see anything suspicious. Sure. Thank you. Good night. Good night. Come in, please. Who are you? Ray Martin. I moved here from England quite some time ago. Lovely town most of the time. Care for one? No, thanks. Oh, too bad. It's a wonderful brandy, Mr. Hakansson. How do you know my name? Detective Laterza from downstairs told me he'd called you. And I saw you yesterday out on the street. I know what happened to your family. I'm sorry. Sit down. He was a lovely chap. We became friends over the years. He died that same night when he called you. Suicide? Someone killed him. I'm glad you don't believe in the official version. That makes two of us. Kind of hard to slash your own throat. Laterza had a feeling he was stepping into a hornet's nest. I asked him, but he didn't want to tell me. At first, I was a bit offended. I thought we were good friends. But now I get it. He was protecting me. From whom? The people who killed him. You need to be careful. It's kinda hard to live your life without knowing who killed your loved ones. Revenge? I don't know. Justice, maybe. Come with me. He put everything he knew up here. FATAL ACCIDENT, CAR SKIDS AND CATCHES FIRE Who's this guy? I don't know. Laterza always said no one could be trusted in this village, not the local politicians, not the police. Corruption is everywhere. I'll be in my apartment if you need me. Thanks. Damn it. Get out of the car. Get out. Get your hands up. Get out, slowly. Come forward. Forward. Two fingers, get your weapon out, put it down. Slowly. I can tell you got it all wrong. I'm really sorry for your family. Cell phone, take it out. Throw it down here. Quickly. Take your handcuffs out. Cuff yourself. You gotta be kidding. Cuff yourself. One hand. Where are we going? Where are we going? Let's go. Where are you taking me? What do you want? Where are we going? I had nothing to do with their kidnapping! I gotta go. My wife needs something. Call me for any emergency, okay? Thanks. What? No. What? What do you want? I ask questions, you answer. What? Laterza. He knew too much, right? That's why someone killed him. - I don't know what you're talking... - Who killed him? I don't know what you're talking about. I saw a picture of you and Lupo. Who is he? What's your connection to him? No Lupo's name came up during the investigation, none! No. Last warning. Who is he? I don't... Fuck. Oh, fuck. What about the kidnappings? It's to finance his operation. Drug smuggling. He alone covers half of Italy. That's all. What about those men who tried to kill me last night? You got here in the wrong moment. Lupo is going to retire. He has this one last operation. Enough to let this girl disappear from San Gallo. San Gallo? San Gallo. Where is San Gallo? Where is San Gallo? Twenty-five kilometers east on Route 34. I told you everything I know. You let me go now. You let me go now! Come on! Come on, you piece of shit! You let me go. Fuck! Fuck! Ah! Shit. Sarto, it's Giordano. No, don't ask me. Come. Come here, 26th Street. Do you know this man? Hey. Do you know this man? It's important. Important to who? Let me ask you a question. Your neighbor, Laterza. Did he commit suicide or not? Are you new here? I'm from Torino. And I think I should be the one asking questions here. Not until I know I can trust you. So you're telling me you don't trust the police? It looks like we both walked into a hornet's nest. Yeah. Listen, I've been doing some research on my own and... this is what I got. Do you know what that means? It's a warning. A warning. I have a wife. And I'm about to become a father. Twins. And I don't know what to do. Well, then you better find Hakansson. Hello? The Albanians are moving. You know what to do. I can't believe this. I'm wondering how he lived so long. He knew everything. He's headed here. San Gallo. Don't move. Don't move. Drop the rifle, slowly. Drop the rifle. Hands up. Hands up. Hands up. A bad wound. He should go to the hospital. No, you take care of him. Hey, honey. April, I need to ask you a favor. Sure. Just do what I'm about to tell you. I don't know if I can do that. Listen. Grab whatever you need for the night and go to the address I'm about to send you. I'll try to be there as quick as I can, maybe in the morning. I... April. I'm-I'm fine. Okay, I'll explain everything when I get there. Sure. Antonio. The little ones need you. - I'm safe. - I'm sorry. I'll send you the address. Okay, thank you. I love you. I love you, too. Number one is not answering. The Albanians are here. Send two men to check it out. Say hi to your dad and tell him to come get you. Say hi to your dad and tell him to come get you. Dad, please come. Please, I can't hold on anymore. Bastard. Giordano. Giordano! Giordano, Maria. Maria, your daughter. Huh? They took her. They know everything. Come on. Calm down. Huh? Giordano. I'm coming. I'll wait for you. Graziani? Yeah, my husband... I know. Come with me. What's going on? Sit down. Some tea? Yeah. I hate it when he does this. He keeps secrets. I'm his wife. - How am I supposed to trust him? - He does it out of love. Giordano, go easy on those... or your heart will blow. Police! Put the gun down! Detective Graziani, we met last night at the police station. I remember. What are you doing here? Look, I know everything about Lupo, Giordano and Sartori. I'm putting my gun away, okay? Don't shoot. Okay, I'm coming down. Look, there's no point for you in seeking for revenge. Oh, my God. Look, there's too many of them. We gotta get out of here, okay? Now. I gotta go. I know about your family. I'm sorry, man. Shit. All right. Bastards. It's incredible. Now they're all here, it's gonna be difficult to get in. Let me try something. Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm with Sartori and Giordano. I'm a policeman, too. Put the gun down. You can simply ask them. Go ask them. Come on. Lupo. Bravo. Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter? Say hi to your dad and tell him to come get you. Dad, please come. Please, I can't hold on anymore. Take me to my daughter. Take me to my daughter! The Albanians. Leotrim. Leotrim. Hello? Giordano. Abort everything. Abort everything! Hello? Take me to my daughter. - You okay? - Yeah. That was close. Thanks. You're gonna need stitches. Thanks. We're gonna have to go up and around to the other side to get to the girl. All right. After you. Holy shit! Good job. Get the radio.Yeah. Let's go. Hey, look. That's Giordano and Sartori. They've taken her down there. Yeah. Oh, shit. We gotta get outta here. Okay, let's go. Okay. Do what you can from up here. Try to cover me. I'm gonna go round the back, get the girl. All right. Shit. Fuck. God. Martin. The babies are coming. On the roof. On the roof. On the roof! No, leave me! Leave me! Stay away. It was an accident. Believe me, just an accident. I-I didn't want... I didn't want... It's not my fault. It's not my fault. I-I didn't want. This is not my fault, believe me. You lose. What's her name? Maria. Maria. It's okay, come on. Maria. Come, I'm a police officer. Don't worry. Come on. It's okay. All right, come on. Don't worry. Don't worry. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Where's my father? This way. Come with us. Come on. Let's go. I'll take these. There's your dad. Dad? Dad.Maria. I made a mistake. Dad... I made a mistake, honey. Hey. All cleaned up, all set. You're free to go.Thanks. Oh, by the way, Giordano... He recovered enough to end up in front of a court and probably the judge is gonna take care of everything, so... Well, it was good work, Detective. Thank you. Oh, yeah. Uh, your newborns. My kids. Wait, I gotta show you a picture. Mmm. They're growing fast. And I guess we can say they're gonna grow up in a better world. Thanks to us. Yeah, let's hope so.Yeah. All right, well... Thanks for everything. You have my number. Anything you need, just give me a call. Will do. Hakansson. Come and visit once in a while. We're gonna miss you. Yeah. There's no joy or sorrow for what we just did. All I remember is a boy walking in his father's footsteps. I stopped. I looked up at the sky. And I knew the tracker, the hunter and its prey... all live inside me.
