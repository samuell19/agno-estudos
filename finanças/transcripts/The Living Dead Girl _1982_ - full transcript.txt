The Living Dead Girl I'll open up for you. What a mess. Chemical waste has to go somewhere. They used to throw it in the river. All the fish died. All right. Lift. - Here, put this on. - What's this for? There's gas down there it's everywhere. There's no airflow. I don't like this, Georges. - What are you afraid of? - I don't like corpses. Go then. I'll do the job myself. - What if we get caught? - Who by, you idiot? She's buried here with her jewelry. That leads straight to the crypt. Look, there it is. Come here. Another coffin. Probably her daughter. She died a few years ago. Have a look, there might be something to take. - Me? - Yes. Go on, hurry up. She's so beautiful. Georges? Are you there, Georges? What happened here? It was just an earth tremor. We often get them. - Can we still eat? - Not for a couple of hours. Sorry about this. We're getting used to this. If you come back in an hour, you can eat. I'd buy it myself if I had the money. The castle is a bargain at this price. There's period furniture in the drawing room. The lawyer is in Paris, but if you're interested, he can be reached on Monday. All the furniture is included with the castle. The library has many rare works from the last century. They say you Americans like strange things. Well, there are vaults beneath the castle... where the owners were buried. Have you seen the piano? It still works. Well, I'm at your disposal if you wish to come back next week. Just call me up to make an appointment. - Have a nice weekend. - Good-bye. Hello? Oh, it's you, Louis. Yes, I'd like that. Hold on, I'll check. Just a minute. I heard a noise in the hall. No, it was nothing. just an old rocking horse. I've no appointments until Tuesday. Yes, I've got the keys until the solicitor comes back. We could come back here after dinner and stay until Monday. I'll be with you in an hour once I've locked up. Helene, it's really lovely. I'll never leave you. I'll always love you. - Do you promise? - Yes, for ever. - Prove it. - How? Be my blood sister. - How? - Like this. - You said you'd always love me. - Of course. Then you have to trust me. If you die first, I'll follow you. If you die first, I'll follow you. I swear it with my blood. I swear it with my blood. Helene, I will always love you. Hello, Madame Va/mom'? Madame Valmont, can you hear me? It's Helene. I've just got back fiom a trip and... Catherine? Answer me. Who is this - Are you sure no one's here? - I'm the only one with the keys. I'll hide the moped. Here it is. You have a very nice place. Family treasure chest. Gold clock. Library. Did you hear that? It was the piano in the drawing room. - Maybe something fell down onto it. - You think so? It's giving me the creeps. - Don't be silly, it's just an animal. - An animal. Maybe it was a rat. Are you frightened of a rat? - Do you want me to look? - No, don't leave me. Don't be silly. Is that you, Louis? Louis, is that you? Stop frightening me. Catherine? My God, I don't believe it. I don't believe it. How can this be? You can't be alive. Catherine, say you recognize me. It's awful, those bodies over there. We have to leave. And call the police. First, get away from here. Catherine, try to speak to me. How did they cover up that you were alive? Why didn't anyone tell me? Me. How I missed you and all the time you were shut up here, hidden away. They let me believe that... But why? Why? They should've known I'd always love you... even if you are different. We have to go now. Straightaway. Will you come with me? Please. I'll stay here with you. I promise. Come on. We mustn't leave behind any trace of what happened. Don't worry anymore. We're together again. I'll stay with you. It's not possible. You're alive. I touched your body and felt the life in you. Tell me it's not true. Tell me. I swear it with my blood. Miriam. Who is this girl? I don't know. I'll ask my boss. By the way, what would you like this morning? I'll have the same as grumpy here. Looks like the Valmont girl who used to live in the castle. - Where did you take it? - Yesterday, in the woods. You can't have. She died over two years ago. It must be someone else. - Who else could identify this girl? - I don't know. Ask in the village. Could I have two apples, please? Do you recognize this girl? She died two years ago. Maybe... my words will find a way into your head. There, inside you, there might be something in your subconscious... that recognizes me and loves me. If there's any life left in you, help me to understand you. Help me to bring you back to this world. Try, Catherine. Give me a sign. Anything. I can't stand this indifference. It's as if you were dead. You're gradually abandoning death. There is life in you, Catherine. You can draw it from deep down within you. Speak to me, Catherine. Make a sound from your throat, you can do it. Speak. Yes. - Hi. - Any news of your mysterious girl? I wanted to go to the castle, but he needs the car. - It's a nice day, take my bike. - Really? Thank you. See you later. Thank you for stopping. I've had a silly accident. I'll gladly help you. - I stupidly ran out of fuel. - Hop in, I'll drive you to a garage. But my car runs on diesel. The village garage doesn't have any. I have it delivered at home. Would you mind dropping me off? I live at the castle about 10 km from here. Of course. I'm on my way to Paris, but no one's expecting me. It's really beautiful. It's not mine, you know. I just rent it. All the same it must be wonderful to live here. Can I offer you something? Yes, thank you. Whiskey? Port? A small port would be perfect. Thank you. Do you live alone in the castle? Of course not. My husband is away for the weekend with the children. I was meant to meet them... but this stupid breakdown means I won't get there until tonight. I won't delay you further. I'd better go. Can I drop you back at your car? If you like. Wait here, I'll fetch my petrol can. - I'll come with you. - I'll only be a minute. Open up. Let me out. Why were you shouting? I wanted to get out, but everything's locked. I always lock up behind me. There's no caretaker, you see? Please excuse me. I'm really sorry. I got into a stupid panic over nothing. - Shall we go? - Don't you want to look around? The vaults date back to the 12th century. No, I'm in a hurry. I'm expected in Paris. I have to leave. We'll go through the garage. I've locked the doors. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Open up. Catherine Valmont? Could I speak to you for a moment? I took it yesterday. I was hoping I could take some more. My name is Barbara Simon. Helene, it's so lovely. I'll never leave you... Helene. I'll always love you. You're not Helene. I came to take some photos, don't you remember? - Where are we? - In the Valmont family castle. In your castle. - Help me. - What do you mean? There's so much blood all around me. - What did you say? - Blood flowing. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. Is that the inn? May I speak to Greg? Yes, the American. It's Barbara. Quickly. He's not there? I must speak to him. Tell him it's urgent. Can I help you? - I called a taxi. - Who are you? Barbara Simon. I'm spending a few days in the village with a friend. - I'm studying photography. - You can't have those photos. You mean photos of Catherine Valmont? Catherine, come to the village. Everyone should see that you're alive. Come with me. Help me. I'm evil. We'll leave tonight. This has been my home for a longtime. Such a long time. We'll go far away. just the two of us. My life and my death are here. Catherine, come on. My place is here in these vaults. You don't know what you're saying. I was fine. Everything around me was blurred. Just fleeting sensations. Death would have quietly taken me back. You wanted to entice me back to the world of the living. Please, be quiet. Look, I'm surrounded by corpses. I made this into a charnel house. I emptied these bodies of blood so that it may flow in mine. To turn me into a living dead girl. That's enough. Enough. You were never dead. The dead don't come back to life. You were put to sleep, drugged, driven mad or I don't know what. I don't understand. I never saw you dead, Catherine. They put an empty coffin in this crypt. No. I'm dead, Helene. I know I am. Don't you understand? I know I am. Kill me. Destroy me. Helene, I'm evil. Finish me off. I can't bear to see you suffer. No more deaths, no more crimes. No more blood. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for coming. I give you The Fireflies. Thank you. Now for the music. - Where's Greg? - He was here a minute ago. - I've got the proof here. - Proof of what? That Catherine Valmont is alive. You have to find Greg for me. OK? Tell him to meet me at the inn later. - What on earth was she on about? - I don't really know. What do you think of the band? - Nearly up to American standards? - Yes, nearly. Get lost. And you, get back home, the party's over. Come with me, quickly. - What's going on? - Your friend Marc had an accident. - Oh, God. Is it serious? - I don't know. He was knocked off his moped. He wants you to come straightaway. - I'll come right away - it's very close. - I'll get dressed. - Come as you are. I have my car. My God, Marc. Come on. Let go of me. You were lying. Marc hasn't had an accident. Let go. Be quiet. Let me go. I've never done anything to you. No, never again. Do it. For me. For us. You must do it. I'll take you away. You'll recover. You still don't understand. You don't understand what I am. You can't save me, Helene. Finish me off. I can't carry on. I'm evil. I'm evil inside. Look Your life is flowing from her body. - Where is she? - She's gone. - You're lying. Let me see her. - Get out of here. Get lost. Where does this passage lead to? She's here. I beg you. I beg you. Please. Save yourself. Go and tell the village what you've seen. Go away. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. I can't. Save yourself, Helene. It doesn't matter. - Do you know what's going to happen? - Yes. Our vow. The two little girls and their music box. Remember? If you die first, I'll follow you. Helene, I am your death.
