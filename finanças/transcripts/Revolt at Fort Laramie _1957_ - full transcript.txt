All right, close up. Looks like they've been in trouble. A pity. They waste their ammunition on the Indians. Soon they will need their bullets to kill each other. Yes, dear lady, very dead, but fortunately, not your captain. Come in. The detail's returned, sir. It has? They've been in action, Major. One dead. I think it's Tatum. The Captain is capable of making his own report. Yes, sir. Sergeant, dismiss the men. Question, sir. What is it? Is there any news from the east in that mail pouch, Captain? We, we've been kind of worried about the, the situation, sir. The mail pouch will be opened by your commanding officer. Until then, try to remember this is the army, and not a political debating society. All right, Sergeant. Detail, dismissed. Jamie! Jamie! Have a hard day, soldier? I earned my pay. Who will I spend it on? Get yourself a wife and find out. Well, supposing you find me a nice girl, Melissa. A nice one wouldn't love you like I do. Er, mail pouch, sir. Howdy, miss. Thank you. Yes, sir. You report to Uncle Seth and then you'd better rest up. For the dance? For after the dance. Captain Tenslip, you have won a great victory, eh? We saved the mail, Salignac. The Sioux haven't attacked a supply wagon in five months now. They think the gold was coming in today? Shall I question the prisoners? We took no prisoners. For all we know, Sarge, the shooting's already started back home. You don't know, so let it go at that. Yeah, sure hate to think of busting up those pretty Southern states of yours. Explain. Sergeant Darrach! I want a burial party outside the gates. Right now! Yes, sir. Are you sure it was Red Cloud who attacked the wagon? It's his warriors, sir. No doubt about it. He wants that gold. Possibly. But his logic escapes me. Little more than a week. We will be placing the gold in Red Cloud's hands. Why would he want to steal it? For ethical reasons, I'd say. Most peculiar code of ethics. He didn't learn them at West Point. Go on, Captain. If he accepts the gold, he can't fight you for a year without breaking his word. By stealing it he can go to war and still retain his honor. A war now would be inopportune. It will come, Major. This country's being opened up to the settlers. That's a clear violation of our agreement with the Indians. Of course you're right, Jamie. But unlike Red Cloud I did learn my craft at West Point. Our orders are to facilitate settlement. I intend to follow them. Ride into a war? If necessary. I've been informed that the gold shipment has already left Fort Torrington. I shall rely on you to see that it reaches here safely. Yes, sir. You also rely on Red Cloud? I don't see that Red Cloud's intentions alter the situation. He's already made one stab at the gold, Major. Do you think he will let the next wagon go through? No, I think it's quite possible he will raid the wagon, but as I said, Captain, the gold has already left. We have no choice but to defend it as best we possibly can. I will inform you as to the time and place of your rendezvous. Very well, sir. Is there any news from the east? That will be all, Captain. Please tell Mr. Salignac, I wish to see him here at once. Yes, sir. At your service, sir. I want a message delivered to Red Cloud. Yes, Major? You will leave immediately. Tell Red Cloud that the attack today disturbed me greatly. Tell him the warriors responsible must be punished. Tell him six days hence I will meet with him here to accept his apologies. Oh, yes. And for this Red Cloud will roast me on a fire, uh? I mean, no more Salignac, no more Indian scout. Tell him any way you want. That's my message. And then maybe he come here and burn you, eh? And then perhaps you have two wars, uh, Major? There will be no war between the States. Oh, good. But if there is, then the good Major from Virginia and poor Salignac, we're not so different, eh? I mean, am I Indian or white man? The battle, it rages in here, Major. Huh? Today I am a white man. Oh, but tomorrow. And you, are you of the South, or you a soldier from Washington? How will your blood battle? Huh, Major? Sarge, what's Tatum's wife gonna do now? Go back to Boston, I guess. Don't look so glum, boy. Sooner or later we will all get one of these here wooden discharges. Shouldn't we ought to do something for Molly? Well, I got a half-month's pay check I don't know what to do with. I will match it. It's all right with me. Well, if it ain't the noble savage. Well, who you spying for today, Salignac? I go to see Red Cloud. You are a brave man. Maybe you wish to come with me, huh? Me? I ain't got enough Indian blood. No. You are a gentleman of the South. And you, Sergeant, you have a great thing to celebrate at the dance. What do you mean by that, Salignac? You have a new president. A man called, er, Davis. But maybe your Mr. Lincoln will have him shot, huh? Old man Jeff Davis will show 'em. I just bet he will. The only thing he will show is his renegade back when he starts running. You ain't calling him no renegade. Who you reckon's gonna chase him, Cooper? I always thought a company of Union troops ought to see the color of your rebel guts. Corporal of the guard! That's enough. Well, what about it? What started this? The South, sir, like always. And we will finish it. You're at attention! Sergeants Darrach and Cooper, you're confined to barracks until further orders. Now return to the Fort. What're you gonna do, Jamie? Nothing. They've been building this for weeks. The sooner it's forgotten, the better. That fight isn't the end it's only the beginning. Not here. Not, on this post. You can't just ignore what's happening. What do you want us to do? Choose up sides and wait for someone to declare war? No, if there is a war there won't be much happiness passed around, will there? Oh, Jamie. Let's take what we can now, Jamie. Darling, marry me. Marry me now. Melissa... I'm afraid. I'm afraid the whole earth will crack wide open and swallow us. Will our marriage save us then? Yes. You're so sure... Of loving you, of each other. And the other loves? Your family, friends, everything you've ever known. Everything I might have to fight against some day. Darling, I don't want to be a statesman, or a soldier, or even a Virginian, I just want to be the captain's wife. And I promise not to shoot at you across the barricade. We will have to get your uncle's permission. Oh, Jamie. Dismissed! Major Bradner! Captain, what was that brawl about between Darrach and Cooper? Only a difference of opinion, sir. I dare say. In the future I expect you to restrain your men from such differences. Yes, sir. Uh... Is there something else? Well, sir, it's about your niece. Yes, Melissa told me. Do you think this is a propitious time for such a marriage? I do, sir. I quite agree. Permission granted. I hope you will permit the honor to announce your engagement at the dance, tonight, Jamie? Why, yes, sir. If you'd do us the honor, sir. Congratulations, Jamie. Pleasure to have you in the family. Thank you, sir. I beg your pardon, sir, may I? You may. Thank you, my dear. Bless you, my children. Thank you. We're the victims of a rumor. Evening, Captain. Miss. Evening. Charming couple, Jamie. Thanks, Doc. Poor Uncle Seth. He will make such a lovely speech and nobody will be surprised. I will. Oh, will you now? You know, Melissa, when you came out here three months ago. I thought to myself, now there's a bold and beautiful girl to kiss in the moonlight, but don't get too involved, Captain. And I thought, there's a fine young man to kiss me in the moonlight. I think I will involve him permanently. Jamie, you will be riding escort for the gold, won't you? In a few days. Routine. No, it isn't, Uncle Seth told me. It will always be routine, Melissa. For the both of us from now on. Yes, sir. I got myself a soldier. Sergeant of the guard! Sergeant of the guard! You will pardon me, Mrs. Ricketts. Major. Yes, sir. Certainly. Excuse me. Pony express. I guess he heard about us, too. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please. I want to make an announcement. It will come as no surprise to any of you. Ladies and gentlemen, as commandant of Fort Laramie, it's my duty to report to you the news that has just reached me. Fort Sumter has been fired on. President Lincoln has called for immediate military intervention against the Southern states. Jamie. Better go to your quarters, Melissa. They sure didn't waste any time splitting us up into separate barracks. We ain't got any time to waste either. Everybody's here now and it's coming. Anybody wants to pull out. Now's the time. You know my feelings, Sarge. I say we light out for Texas, and join the Confederate Army. Shoot, there isn't enough of us. We'd never get through. How many can we count on? Ten, I know that many will ride with us. What about your barracks? Got nine. Hendrey? Two or three and that's all. Rinty? I can deliver six, maybe more. You? Six. What about you? I got nothing but Yanks. Well, I got a dozen myself. How many's that make, Ezra? Not enough. They outnumber us three to one. How about the Major? He's from Virginia, ain't he? You didn't expect to see him here tonight, did you? Use your head, mister. When we ride out of here the Major will be first in line. Three to one against us. That won't matter, if we strike first. Now the Sarge's got it all worked out. We will split up into three detachments. The first will take the arsenal. That will be me. You take a third of the men and take the quartermaster's store. Ezra, here, he will cover the stables. We will have the horses, the supplies and the ammunition. The Yankee's will have to surrender. Or fight with nothing. When do we move? The day after the wagon gets in with the gold. And then, when we get to Texas with $50,000, they will turn the place over to us. We will be lucky to get there with our hair on. We gotta go right through Sioux territory. I will fight with the next man, I just don't like to see no massacre. Are you in or out, mister? I'm in. Got a right to talk, ain't I? The rest of you with us? Count on me. Count on me. Let's go, come on. All right, let's everybody split up. Ezra and I will go talk to the Major. Did you talk to Caswell? Yeah. He's waiting to take us to the old man now. All right, let's go, I made some fresh coffee. Oh, good. You'd do best to get some sleep, my dear. It's quite late. What's gonna happen, Uncle Seth? To the Fort? I'm sure I don't know. To me, I will try to do my duty, whatever that may be. Have you discussed the future with Jamie? There's nothing to discuss. You will still marry him? Of course. I wish my decision was so sure. God grant you peace of mind, Melissa. There will be little enough of it in the days ahead. Come in. Request to speak to the Major, sir. Personal matter. Well, yes, very well Melissa, my dear, would you... I will stop over at Molly Tatum's for a minute. Goodnight, Uncle Seth. Goodnight, my dear. What is it, Caswell? Two of the men, sir. Like to talk to the Major. Can't they see Captain Tenslip? It's only for the Major's ears, sir. Wouldn't take a minute. Can't it wait till morning? No, sir, it can't. They're right outside, sir. Very well, send them in. Thank you, sir. I'm sorry, Major, but... Did you ever hear of military channels, Sergeant? I have. But this concerns us, sir, not Captain Tenslip. Who is "us"? Confederate soldiers. I've received no orders regarding Southern troops. Sure, Major, we just wanted you to know you can count on your friends. I can? And to accomplish precisely what? Well, sir, we're outnumbered, but the way we see it, if we hit first, we can grab the guns and the supplies, and the gold when it comes in. Then light out for Texas, sir. In short, an act of mutiny and of theft. An act of patriotism, sir. All quiet, Johnny? Like a real quiet fuse. I keep waiting for something to explode. Well, it won't be tonight. Melissa. Molly Tatum's asleep. There will be no more war for her. She bargained for that when she married him, Melissa. Oh, Jamie, it's such a cruel bargain. The enemy he fought was her enemy. It won't be that simple for us. But, Jamie, your job is here. You won't be fighting the Confederacy. I could be ordered back east tomorrow. But you're needed here at Fort Laramie like, like Uncle Seth. Melissa, my government was attacked at Fort Sumter. My comrades were shot at. It's my war, Melissa. I will do my best to fight in it. I see. Of course you will, Jamie. Shall I go back to Virginia and wait for your invasion? You will have to decide that for yourself. Melissa. Will you marry me? It won't work, will it? I was so sure it wouldn't matter. The war won't last forever. Oh, Jamie, I do love you. Captain, I gotta talk to you. It's important. Hendrey, isn't it? Yes, sir. All right, come in. All right, trooper. Well, what is it? You can talk in front of the lieutenant. Sir, I think you ought to know, there's gonna be trouble. It's the Southerners. What about 'em? They had a meeting tonight, in the stables. Well, you're from the South yourself, aren't you? Yes, sir, I am. I was at the meeting and I tried to talk 'em out of it. Only they wouldn't listen. Talk 'em out of what? They're gonna take over the Fort, sir. They got it all worked out. They're gonna grab the weapons and supplies, and head for Texas with the gold. You're sure of this? Yes, sir. They figure they're at war and it's them or you. How do you feel about it? Oh, they haven't got a chance, sir. Why, if you don't wipe 'em out, the Indians will. Sounds pretty wild to me, Jamie. A bunch of hot-heads pumping themselves up in the dark. They will forget it in the morning. Begging your pardon, Lieutenant. But I don't think so, the Major's in with them. What? Do you know what you're saying, man? Yes, sir, they went to see him tonight. He will have 'em all in the guardhouse. They left there five minutes ago, and they went back to the barracks. You'd better get back there yourself. And keep this quiet, understand? Oh, yes, sir. I'm not about to advertise it. I only reported this because I thought I was doing my duty, sir, I'm sure your devotion will be rewarded. Thank you, sir. Goodnight, Captain. Lieutenant. Do you think he was telling the truth? Of course he was. But the Major... Jamie, he's got 20 years service. He's a West Pointer. And a Virginian. Well, what're we gonna do? What would you suggest? Arrest him? He's Commanding Officer. All we can do is sit and wait for it to blow up in our faces. Took me a little walk. Spring sure is in the air. What's the matter, Sarge? Did I forget to put my pants on or something? * Look away, look away, look away Dixie land * I wish I was in Dixie I didn't tell 'em, I had to see the Captain about something else. I didn't tell 'em anything. * I will take my stand to lib and die in Dixie * Away, away, away down South in Dixie * Away, away Away down South in Dixie * I wish I was in the land of cotton. * Old times there are not forgotten * Look away, look away Look away, Dixie land * I wish I was in Dixie Hooray * Now ain't that just awful? I bet we can do a lot better than that. * John Brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave. Come on! * John Brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave * John Brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave * John Brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave * But his soul goes marching on * I will take my stand * To lib and die in Dixie Come on, sing, sing. * Look away, look away * John Brown's body lies a-moldering in the grave * But his soul goes marching on * Glory, glory, hallelujah Glory, glory, hallelujah * Glory, glory, hallelujah * Look away, look away * Glory, glory, hallelujah * Glory, glory, hallelujah His soul is marching on. What is it? What's wrong? Stay inside, Melissa. * Looking kindly down The stars of heaven are looking kindly down * The stars of heaven are... Tenslip! Yes, sir. * Of old John Brown. Those maniacs. Bugler, blow assembly! * Hallelujah Glory, glory, hallelujah * Within the walls of this fort is a company of the Army of the United States. The States are no longer united. Each of you has chosen his own loyalty. Perhaps there are some of you who have yet to make that decision. Whichever way you chose, you will for the present time, continue to exist together. In anger, if necessary with hatred, but within this fort you will remain a company of soldiers. That order doesn't come from me or from Washington. That order comes from Red Cloud and his warriors. Captain Tenslip, be good enough to come to my office, first thing in the morning. Yes, sir. All right, Sergeant, dismiss your men. Company, dismissed. Jamie, I assume you know the ring leaders of last night's outbreak? Yes, sir. Most of them. They will compose your detachment to escort the gold. You will leave immediately and you will meet the wagon at Tomahawk Crossing. Will my men include the ring leaders on both sides, Major? Or just the North? Both sides. Now suppose you explain that remark? I'm fully aware of the rebel plot to take over this fort and steal the gold. I'm also aware, Major, that last night you met with their leaders. Captain Tenslip, I do not intend to submit the conduct of this office to you for your judgment or your approval. You will please carry out my orders. If my suspicions are wrong, Major, I apologize. And I'd suggest you allow me to convoy the gold directly to Red Cloud. In view of our own abrogation's, I have no assurance that Red Cloud will honor the treaty. He will get no gold from us until we hear from Salignac. Salignac? Major, I'd sooner trust Red Cloud himself. Well, it appears, Captain, that you're just short on trust all around. Come in! Sir, the body of one of the troopers was just found outside the gate. Whose body? Hendrey, sir. He was scalped. But not by a Sioux. That's all, Serrell. You know anything about this? Hendrey, Major, was the man who informed me of the rebel plot. I will make a complete investigation. In the meantime, you will convoy the gold. Back to the Fort, sir? Back to the Fort, Captain. This is all Sioux territory over to here. Uh-huh. They will hit the supply wagon either here or at the bend of the river. Well, if they come from here they will have to attack from the south. That's right. We haven't seen a Sioux in the two days we've been south of the river. They're down there someplace. Any trouble? No, sir. Got close enough to eat with them. Where are they? About two miles due south, sir. A large war party. Very well. Go get yourself some rations. Thank you, sir. A surprise attack before dawn might scatter 'em before the supply wagon comes through. By the time we got down there we wouldn't even find a campfire. You think they've been scouting us, too? A trooper passed you that tin of rations a few minutes ago, didn't he? Yeah. Who was it? I didn't notice. It was too dark to see. Next time, Lieutenant, take a better look. Cooper. Yes, sir. Lash the horses together and detail a few men to ford the stream with them. We're gonna walk the rest of the way. The men are awfully tired, sir. Tell that to the Sioux, Sergeant. Let me in on it. They've established our presence here. Now we're gonna slip past them on foot. That will put the Sioux between us and the Fort. We will never be able to fight our way back. We will fight some other day. Tomorrow we run. Men, Carl, Come on. Take them across through there. Hurry up. Come on, let's hurry it up. We will be sitting out there like ducks on a pond. If we'd slip back downstream while it was dark. It will be tough enough to run it in the daylight. Great, we get ourselves shot full of holes and the rebels get the gold. They haven't got it yet. All right, shove off. My congratulations, Captain. Salignac. Where'd you come from? From your enemy. From Red Cloud. You know, one of these days, Salignac, you're gonna happen along either too early or too late. Then we will know which side you're on. You men, unload it. The gold's intact, sir, but we lost two men. I will take charge of the gold. Jake, the Major will need some help putting that gold in the safe. See that, he gets it. Yeah, I know what you mean. You men are dismissed. That will be all, Lieutenant. Please have Mr. Salignac come in. Have a hard day, soldier? Earned my pay I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye before you left. Sure. We both got kind of busy. Jamie, I'm going back to Virginia. When? As soon as I can arrange it with Uncle Seth. Like a fellow once said, "The war won't last forever." If you play your cards right maybe you can ride to Texas with your Uncle Seth. Or do you already know about that? What do you mean? He and the rest of the rebels are planning to jump out of here with the gold. That's not true. Ask him. He wouldn't do that, Jamie, he couldn't. Why not? The Mason-Dixon line runs right down the middle of that square. The only neutrals are out in that graveyards. Then you will not want to be consorting with the enemy. The war goes well for you, huh, Major? You may go, Mr. Salignac. Red Cloud refuses to come to the Fort. Is that Salignac's doing? Salignac was merely the intermediary. No, Red Cloud has offered to meet us in two days at the bend of the river. What would you do? I'd ride it in full force to meet him, sir. And pay over the gold. If you recall, my orders are to withhold the gold until we are aware of Red Cloud's intentions. Are those Union orders, or Confederate? There you have it. The bitterest choice of all. Whether to break your oath or your heart. I've always had the greatest admiration for your decisiveness, Jamie. Which call would you listen to? I don't have any choice to make, Major. You have now. I've just received word to release all Southern troops whose loyalty to the Union is in doubt. As my last official act, Major Tenslip, you are now Acting Commandant of Fort Laramie. Effective immediately, sir? Immediately. For your first command. Good luck, Jamie. Thank you, sir. Caswell. Yes, sir? Will you send Sergeant Darrach in. Reporting, sir, Sergeant Darrach, pass the word along that any Southern trooper who desires it may receive an honorable discharge. I'm ready to ride South to Texas with them. What about the gold, sir? Son, we can either leave the gold or our honor behind. Which would you choose? We've never questioned the Major's orders before and we ain't about to do it now. The gold in the safe, Major. We will ride whenever you're ready. Yes, sir. Major, you don't stand a chance of getting through. You've got a 100 miles of Sioux territory to cross. We're no longer soldiers, the Sioux have no quarrel with us. I'm sorry, Jamie, this is between Red Cloud and you now. Now may I borrow your office? Major, so Major Bradner has made his decision. Someday I must make mine. I will save you the trouble, Salignac, I will give you exactly 15 minutes to clear out of this Fort. You are a foolish man. No, just a careful one. You can ride out with the Southerners or go back to the Sioux. Oh, but you see, again you ask me to make a choice. Uncle Seth, have a good ride. My dear, if I could take you... I know. I wouldn't want you to be wasting your time protecting us womenfolk out there I will stay here with the others. If a relieving garrison comes through, I'm sure Jamie will see you get home. If it's up to Jamie, I'm more likely to see the inside of an internment camp. I suppose that's what this is now, isn't it? No, it's still Fort Laramie. Jamie's the same man. You're the same woman. Bye, Uncle Seth. Bye, Melissa. He will get through, Melissa. If you're very lucky, Major, one day you may have the opportunity of fighting him. I will move my things from your new quarters. Isn't that Red Cloud himself? Yes, Major. I guess he is here for the powwow and to receive his tribute. I'd almost forgotten. Yesterday seems a year away. Well, we will deliver Major Tenslip's message. They're not hostile. They think we've come here for the powwow. Remember, we're not soldiers this time. Tell Chief Red Cloud, greetings. The Chief returns the greetings and hopes the white chief is well. Tell him I'm no longer white chief. He asks why you have come to the powwow if you are no longer soldiers. Tell him we're on a journey and that Major Tenslip is now in command. He will powwow with the chief when we're safely through Sioux territory. What does he say? He thinks it is a trick. If the gold is not paid today as was promised, he will not be bound by the treaty. Well he's bluffing. Without that gold he can't fight a war. Lies, lies. White chief not tell truth. Make treaty with Red Cloud, no keep word. Drive Sioux off his hunting grounds. Scare game away. Not pay gold. Red Cloud fight. We will ride on. Gentlemen, if you know any prayers, say them now, Circle the wagons! Cease fire. Here comes some more. Over here. Sergeant Darrach, are there any casualties? Doesn't appear to be, Major. Good. Mr. Updike, strengthen the perimeter for the next attack. Look, Major, a flag of truce. This attack was to show us they mean business. Now, we will be invited to surrender. Mr. Salignac, please go out and talk to them. At your service, sir. Sergeant Darrach, build up the defenses. All right, Major. Some of you men, let's get these wagons closed up. Well, Mr. Salignac? Chief Red Cloud sends his respects, Major. He says he has no quarrel with men who are no longer soldiers. What does he want? You Major. You're crazy! Quiet, Go on, Mr. Salignac. Red Cloud wants you as a hostage. He does not believe that the Fort will refuse to pay a bounty for you. If you surrender your men will receive safe travel through Sioux territory. Otherwise, you will be killed to the last man. Tell Red Cloud I accept. You can't do it, sir. When he finds out Tenslip won't pay the ransom, he will have you killed. No, but not without certain unpleasant ceremonies. I am quite aware of that, Mr. Salignac. We won't stand for it, sir. Not one of us. If you go out there, Major, we will all go with you. We will all be killed. I appreciate your loyalty, gentlemen, even though it's a foolish one but I'm making this an order. Begging your pardon, sir. Civilians don't take orders. They vote. The polls are open, men. All in favor of staying with the Major say aye. Aye! Opposed? You got your answer, Salignac. Now take it back to Red Cloud. Major, you are in command of a troop of imbeciles. But I congratulate you. Here they come. Fire! They will wait till morning now. And we will still be here. Major, Salignac's gone. He sold us out. Dirty half-breed. It wasn't his battle. How's the ammunition holding out? It ain't very good, Major. I'm about out. We can't fight with our bare hands. We better keep an eye on him. He will slip out after dark and surrender himself. He won't go alone. Well, let's make sure he doesn't go at all. I've got to see Major Tenslip. Open the gate. Open the gate. Come in. Sir, Salignac's at the gates. But he left with Major Bradner's men. Yes, sir. He's awful anxious to see you. I told you to stay clear of Fort Laramie. Oh, you will forgive me, sir, but Major Bradner's men have been ambushed by the Sioux. Where? They are surrounded. To the south of Devil's Gorge. The truth? Yes, the truth. Salignac, if this is a trick I will see you hanged from that gate. Serrell! Send Lieutenant Waller to my office. Yes, sir. I perform one honorable act and he wants to hang me. Salignac, what are their chances? They don't have any. You can't just take Salignac's word for it, Jamie. And if I refuse his word? The Major dies and every man with him. And Red Cloud will run wild out there. Now if it's a trap you will be committing the worst military blunder since the Charge of the Light Brigade. The Major always knew everything that happened in this fort. You see most of it from this window. Things look different from in here. Maybe you can see the view for yourself some day. Call out the men. I will take a volunteer detachment. Yes, sir. Jamie, you are going? Yes. You know, you don't have to do this for my sake. Melissa, if I'm sure of nothing else, I know this is right. And that's not easy to decide any longer. Oh, it used to be simple enough. Fight the enemy, hate them, defeat them. But with men like Major Bradner on the other side, it's... Well, I can say no worse of them than they fought for what they believed in. I believe I have to go to his help. That's the best answer I can give you, Melissa. Jamie. Uncle Seth says we're the same people, we've always been. Have we changed, you and I? I will always love you, Melissa. Oh, Jamie. Something I could do, Major? Yes, you should get as much sleep as you can, Caswell. Yes, sir. So should you, sir. Oh, I was just stretching my legs. Well, I will walk with you. What is it? Sioux campfires. Make a circle. The Major's men must be in the center. Cooper. Yes, sir. I want to get through the Sioux lines and make contact with Major Bradner. Think you can find an opening? I think I can make one. Take as many men as you need. I only need one hole, I'll only need one man. Major! Major, wake up. Wake up, wake up. What is it? The Sioux, I think they're sneaking up. What is this? I was afraid you'd walk in your sleep, Major. Well, of all... Take it off. Yes, sir. Over here. Cooper. Some mess you Rebs got yourself into. You alone? Major Tenslip's out there with a detachment, right on the other side of the Indian lines. Can you get through? I will go back and bring them back. But you make sure you hold your fire when we get here. That won't be hard. We ain't got very much ammunition left. Is that right? You Southern boys must don't know how to fight a war, do you? Now listen, mister... As you were. We need all the help we can get. We will be back before daybreak. Hey, Coop. Yeah? Good luck. You know, I bet you really mean that. We still have a surprise waiting for them. Yes sir. Oh, you will need this Major. I resigned my commission. That doesn't take effect till after the battle. You're still in command, sir. Serrell, look out! Eighteen dead. They fought good. They were soldiers. I'm sorry about the Major, sir. Men, Red Cloud will lick his wounds for a few weeks. Now you can ride on or re-enlist. The choice is still yours. Thank you, Major. It ain't gonna be any easier, but I think we better go on. We will take charge of the casualties.
