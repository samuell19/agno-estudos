Ana, listen to me. No. No. There must be something else. Ana, listen to me. -No. Ana. -No! There must be something. This is all wrong. I hate it, too. But this is where we are. Okay, now with you there... ...we can keep working. -Build on the parts-- -I can't go back. We don't have a choice. They are working with the local law enforcement. They know where you work. They know where you live. How long? The order gives two weeks. All right, now we need to start making arrangements for you and Izzy. What? If you want, I can help make arrangements with Izzy. You don't mind if I... -What? Oh, no. -Hi. Ethan. -Izzy. You're the transfer on the team, right? That's me. You any good? You don't come to the games? No, not really. Well then, yes, I am pretty good. -It's good to meet you. -You, too. Afternoon, Ms. Alvarez. How are you? Hi, fine. I'm-I'm sorry, is there something wrong? Oh, no, nothing's wrong. I just wanted to say congratulations on Izzy's acceptance. What? Mr. Adams: I, oh, God, um... I'm sorry. I thought she had told you. Uh, yeah. Indiana University. It's a great school. You should be very proud. Izzy's a fantastic student. Yes, I know she is. Well, I just wanted to say congratulations, and if you need any help, please do let me know, okay? Yes, thank you. Mr. Adams: Have a great rest of your day. How was school? Good. The usual. -Nothing new? -No, not really. Oh, actually, I don't have to take the final for chemistry. Oh. Okay. If we keep above a 93% this semester, we're exempt from the final. That is good. How was your day? Um, it was fine. Did you pick up the lavender spray? What? Ms. Chapman doesn't like the lemon. -You were gonna get some. -No, I-I forgot. Are you okay? Yes, I'm-I'm fine. I'm just-just tired. I'm fine with having a homeowner's association for the lakefront properties, but if we're going to have one, then the rules must be enforced. It's not fair for some of us to go the extra mile when some people get away with almost anything. Last week, I saw Marty Groom painted their fence. Completely out of code. And would anyone say something? No, of course not. But I just know that when I say something at the meeting, they're all going to hate me. But secretly, they all feel exactly the same way. Ms. Chapman, I'm about to start vacuuming. I just wanted to let you know in case the noise bothered you. I'm fine. All right, Zack. Looking good. -We'll talk again next week. -All right, thank you. Yeah. Ms. Alvarez, good morning. Hi. Poor kid. He's one of those students that doesn't ever want to leave high school. It's like pulling teeth to get him to write an application essay. So what can I do for you? I wanted to talk to you about the university. IU. Yeah, it's a-a great school. Yes. But... The tuition. Yes. The, uh... the difficult part about Izzy's situation is that while she's currently allowed to go to school, she can't qualify for any kind of financial aid or federal scholarships. Yes, I know that. Also, she's gonna have to pay out of state tuition rates. Now, there are a few private options, but they're highly competitive, and unfortunately, they've already been designated for the year. So I think our best option is to get Izzy enrolled, and then, with her first semester grades, I feel confident there will be some help to enable her to finish. If we wait, there's no telling what will happen. How much... how much is it for the first semester? It's $18,000. Now, I know it's a lot, but if it helps, anyone can contribute, even anonymously. So if there's anyone back home or Izzy's father-- This is our home. Yes, you're right. I didn't mean to imply otherwise. Yes. Mmm. Yes, of course, but I wanted to see if there was something we... yes. I understand but, you see, she is a good student. Yes, of course. Yes. I will try. What is that? A poem. I'm trying to memorize it. What for? English. We each got a poet from Indiana. Can I hear it? I don't have it all yet. It's okay. Just read it. "Moonlight now in Malibu. "The winter night. The few stars. "Far and far as your lips are near. "Filled with the same might as your eyes. "Darling, darling, darling. The future has long gone by. "And the past will never happen. "We have only this, our one forever. So small, so infinite, so brief, so vast." -Hey. -Hey. You didn't tell me you were smart. -Who told you that? -Everyone. I need your help. I'm failing Algebra 2. -How bad? -Bad. And I can't graduate without it. What's in it for me? Good company. And food. -Okay. -Tomorrow? -Sure. -Great. Your cash flow looks steady, though a lot lower than we'd like. How about a co-signer? Someone with a more substantial financial situation that could assure us a little more. Help get the interest rate down. No. Okay, well, we're in the business of helping people, so here's what I can do. There are a couple of details, but the basics of what I can offer you is a loan of $10,000 at an interest rate of 23 percent, which you pay back monthly over five years. That seems high. We can only assume so much risk given what I have here in front of me. How soon would I get the money? Assuming everything goes through, it would be in your account on Monday. Three business days from today. And I'll make you a deal. Special, just for you. I'll extend the loan six months. And you can have the first six months with no payments due. Okay. Okay, let's do it. Okay, well, let me run a photocopy of your identification, and, uh, here. You can get started on this paperwork. You're not a US citizen. No. Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do for you today, Ms. Alvarez. But you saw my work history. It's a bank policy. I really wish I could help people like you. I really do. But my hands are tied. But you should really look into becoming a citizen. You know, if you're thinking about staying here. Thank you for your time. Why did you not tell me you were accepted? Who told you? Mr. Adams. Izzy, it should have been you. I didn't want you worrying about it. -I know it's impossible. -That school is where you belong. I will find a way to make sure you-- Don't. I'm happy here with you. You deserve to go to that school, and you are going. -How? -I don't know. I will find a way. That's not how it works. We don't have that kind of money. Izzy, don't worry. I will find a way. I'll eat later. This stuff is like a foreign language to me. It just takes some practice. I clean your house. What? Well, my mom does. I help sometimes. Okay. I just wanted to tell you because I feel like it would be weird if I didn't. But now it feels weird that I did. No, you're fine. So you've met my mom? Ms. Chapman? Yes. Sorry. What made you move here? Well... my dad's dating someone with younger kids. I guess it's getting serious, so he wanted me to try moving out here with my mom. What about you? What's your family like? It's just me and my mom. -We're really close. -That's good. Have you always lived here? For a while, yeah. And before that? Nicaragua. My mom brought me here when I was a baby. Do you remember anything? No. I was a baby. It was really bad for us there. My mom doesn't like to talk about it. Can we talk? Man: Be good, bro. You look good. I need money. So you want your job back at the bar? I need $18,000 in ten days. Jesus Christ, Ana. Are you still doing cars? No. I gave that shit up. Look, I'm not holding out on you. I just... I don't have anything going on right now. And what do you need that kind of money for anyway? I just need it. Now. The only way I know to get that kind of money is to rob a bank or something. No, I don't want anyone to get hurt. I don't want any guns. There's other ways of doing it. Have you done this? I've never done it myself, but... I've heard some really good stories about it. What kind of stories? The banks are insured. The bank managers, they don't want anybody to get hurt. So they just hand over the money. No mess. No guns. No one gets hurt. Ms. Chapman: All done? Yes. Um, I, I wanted to ask you something. Of course, sweetie. What is it? Izzy got accepted to Indiana University in the fall. Oh, well... well, that's fine. I'll still keep you on. And I could find help for you or if you want to do it-- No, it's-it's not that. Say no more. I like you girls. I want to help out. How about I bump up your rate another $30 a week? That is, that is so generous of you. But... I wanted to ask for a small personal loan. For her tuition. Just-just for the first semester. Oh. You really think that's a good idea? I mean, sending Izzy to such an expensive school, I mean... you don't want to get her hopes up. Look, I'd love to help out. I really would. But honestly, I think that would create a bad pattern. It would be teaching both of you that she didn't have to work for anything herself. You know, I worked a part-time job myself all the way through school. Whatever you figure out, you'll have done it on your own. It's a wonderful feeling. I, I understand. Trust me. You'll thank me one day. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Teller: Next. Can I help you? Yeah. Yeah, I'll let you know. Okay, bye. What'll it be? Um, can I have a money order? Okay, how much? Um... Here. Free of charge. Looks like $4,840. All in the money order? Can I have 200 back, please? I'm sorry, 400. It's still your money. Fee in cash or card? Um, cash. Can I see your ID? Um... you know, I-I can't seem to find it. -I'm not from here. -It's no problem. Twenty percent without ID. Okay. Who do I make it out to? Holy shit, Ana. That shit was next level. I am so proud of you, girl. I did not think you had it in you. How much was the take? This is what we agreed on. All right, all right. No tip, huh? Hey, let me get us some drinks, on me. Old time's sake. -Drink up. -No, no. -No. -Come on, drink it. All right, suit yourself. What a rush, huh? Listen, don't get all paranoid, okay? You're just coming down from the adrenaline. It's totally natural. How's your daughter doing? Jenny? Jessica, right? Is she old enough to come down here yet? No. Not yet. So I was thinking on the next job, we go in together as a team. We both take a drawer. No, no. Look, I'm not trying to squeeze your take. I'm just trying to double mine. I will tell you where. Same plan. What's stopping me from doing it on my own? -Old time's sake. -Ah. I guess that's what's stopping me from turning you in, too, huh? Your Honor, she was wearing a dark scarf. She had dark hair and an accent. I think I saw her off 23 in an old trailer. I'm not trying to put pressure on you. I'm just trying to improve upon my good idea. One more. My way. Then we can talk. -Wait one second. -Mom. Okay, make a wish. -When did you grow up? -Stop. Hey, I'm sorry about the other night. -I didn't mean to. -It's okay. So I have good news for you. It looks like the bank is going to work with me on a small loan. What? How? It's only enough for the first semester, but I spoke with Mr. Adams, and he said once you are in, you can apply for private scholarships. And he's going to help you. - College. Like, actual college. -I am so proud of you. -Mom. Happy birthday, Isabella. You deserve this. Nice bike. Is it new? Thanks. Yeah. Did you study? Yeah. -Liar. Come on. Come on. What's the quadratic formula? Come in and I'll tell you. What will you do in the fall? My dad wants me to go to NYU, but I don't know. Wow, that's great. I've always wanted to see New York. -Yeah. -What will you study? -Probably creative writing. -You write? Not yet, but I want to. Haven't found much to write about. What about you? Where will you go? -IU. -No Ivy League offers? I'm just kidding. That's great. -Here. -Thank you. ♪ ♪ -Hi. -Hi, welcome to Rooter's. What can I make for you tonight? Uh, what do you want? -I'll have cookie dough. -Okay, so two large cones. One vanilla and then another cookie dough. All right, that's gonna be nine dollars. -And the vanilla, thank you. -Thank you. You guys have a wonderful night. -Thank you. You, too. -See you soon. What is it? Nothing. Everything's okay. Nothing's changed. I just wanted to see how you were holding up. -Can I come in? -Of course. Can I get you anything? No thanks. So how did she take it? You didn't tell her. Ana, you have to tell her. I will. Look, I can't imagine what you're going through right now. So I won't pretend. But she deserves to know. And we need to start making a plan. For both of you. -Her plan does not change. -Okay. Fine. But what about you, hm? I mean, do you have somewhere to go when you get back? Look, this is gonna happen one way or another. And we need to work on this together. Because time is running out, and when it does, it's gonna get ugly in a way that you don't want and we don't need. Do you understand that? This, this, this is real now. I'm just... I'm just taking care of a few things. Let me take care of Izzy. Just till she turns 18. Oh, hey, Izzy. -Is everything okay? -Oh, everything's fine. I just stopped in to have your mom sign some paperwork. You have a good night, okay? -Izzy: Good night. -Good night. I can help who's next. Good afternoon. It's okay. You can do this. Hi. I have a fucking gun... Okay, what seems to be the problem here? There's no problem. It's okay, it's okay. All in the money order? Yes, minus the fee. Oh, hi, sweetie. Today isn't Thursday. Actually, I'm here to see Ethan. Oh. I don't understand. How do you... of course. Come in. Hey. Hey. This isn't the girl you've been telling me about, is it? No, Izzy's just been helping me with my math homework. Oh, well, isn't that nice of you, dear? Do we need to pay you? Uh, no. Sorry. What'd I tell you, girl? Boom. I tripled our take. You know, I could have used you back there. You kind of hung me out to dry. You brought a gun! Relax, I didn't shoot anybody with it. I, I can't do this. I'm done, we're done. -What? -You put me in danger. You put those people in danger. Okay, first of all, have a drink. Secondly, look around. Who's in danger? And thirdly, have a fuckin' drink, Ana. -Is this a joke to you? -Yeah, it kind of is. Forgive me for wanting more. I saw an opportunity and I went for it. I'm done. I'm out. You came to me for my expertise. -I said same-- -And that's what I gave you. No, I said same plan, no guns. I'm out. I, I can't. I'm out. Ana, I don't know what kind of trouble you're in, but, uh... I'm assuming it ain't over yet. You came to me as a friend and that's exactly how I played this. Make no mistake. You and me, we're in this together now. You're right, you're right. Sorry. I'm going to use the restroom. Come have a drink when you get back. Okay. Police, hands up. Hands up, now! Izzy, let's go. Now. Put your things in your bag. Go where? Mom, what are you talking about? We have to go now. Let's go. Put your things in your bag, please. -Mom. -It's okay. -I have school. -It's okay, we'll figure it out. Just a few days. Put your things in your bag. Mom, what is going on? Izzy, come on, please. Go. Hey. Can I have a room? How many nights? Can I pay for each night? Sure. I need a card for incidentals. -There'll be a $50 hold on it. -No, I have cash. I still need a card. How much for the room? Forty-five a night. Okay, how about I pay you $65, no card? Look, lady, it's real simple. $45 and a card. No exceptions. Here's $200. You can have all of it. That's at least three nights. No card. Mom. Tammy had bad news last night, didn't she? Izzy. It's okay. We are going to be fine. We're not supposed to have secrets. I... I just, I'm... I just didn't want to scare you. Great job. What's gonna happen? I don't know. But we just need to lay low while Tammy figures it out. Okay? No more secrets. No more secrets. Strive for your chance at $25,000 and get $2,500 minimum for your trade-in. See dealer for details.

Teller: Can I help you? Ms. Alvarez? No habla inglés. She doesn't speak English. Oh, but I... I'm sorry. Hey, Izzy. I want to talk to you. -I'm really sorry. -It doesn't matter. Izzy. Where did this come from? Don't lie to me again. What is this? I promised I won't lie to you, which is why I can't tell you. -Can't tell me what? -You have to trust me. Where did you get this? Izzy, I can't. -Mom, I'm not a child. -That's not it. Are you in danger? This will all be over soon. What will be over soon? You didn't tell me about Tammy. You didn't tell me about this. You say you love me but you don't trust me at all. Of course I do. Izzy, sit down. I want something more for you. Don't you understand that? I understand that you're not telling me the truth. I'm not lying to you. Because you're not telling me anything. Izzy. Look at me. Look at me. I love you. Hey. Izzy. Izzy.

They're ready for you. I thought we were gonna fight this. We did. We have. What's gonna happen to you? This is my path now. You're going to have... a beautiful life, Isabelle. You are going to graduate at the top of your class. And then, you will start school in the fall. I can't do this without you. -It's not fair. -I know that. I know that. But you can do this. You can. Look at me.
