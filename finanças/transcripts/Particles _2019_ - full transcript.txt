-Hello. -Hello. Hello. -Hey. -Hi. -All good, man? -Yeah, fine. No, don't sweat it. Passbooks and cards! Passbooks and cards! So, the probability of A times B, plus the probability of ABA, times BBA. Sorry. No phones in class. Sorry. So... I'm so sorry. -The probability of A... -Fuck, Mérou. ...for the probability of B given that A, plus the probability... Get serious. You need to get serious. I feel sorry for you. So, the formula... Stop laughing! Talk about serious when you tell Lea you like her. ...each time in each exercise. Shut up. For the Baccalaureate you'll definitely have a probability question, 99% likely. So you need to write out the complete law of probability, the probability of the event, followed by your work. You kids ready for the picture? Ladies in front, sit up straight, get your hands out of your pockets... Look at the camera, perfect! -Mérou, straight. -Stop it! Hey! Boys, boys! Phys Ed is later. -Yes. -No problem. Smile. There. Be natural. You're not... You're tense. Relax. Stressed, Mérou? Nice. You're all beautiful. Great, let's do it! Smile, young man up there in the purple coat. -What a dweeb! -Smile. Yes, you! He's busting my balls. -Come on, smile. -He has a crush on you. The Arc de Triomphe, where lies the remains of the unknown soldier as a memorial to the lost lives of all those who fell on the battlefield in honor... From the Arc de Triomphe unto this monument where we are gathered, from the Notre Dame bell tower where the bells echo the nation's heartbeat, reminding its children they must unreservedly... Great vibe, right? Honestly, that little fanfare was a blast. It's not a fanfare, it's a harmony. In any case, thanks for coming guys, you saved my day. The pleasure is all ours, always happy to mock you. Little yellow canary. Cute little chick in the back seat, so cute in your yellow suit. So you can spot them at night. Hold on, he's tuning. Just playing. Go. -Done? -Ready? Can we play, now? Fuck... -Come on! -Whoa... -Calm down! -Waiting on you. Three, two, one. No! Get off me! You get off me! Dirty! Hey, it's dirty in there! -Want some dirty? -All dirty! -All dirty! -All dirty. Super dirty. P... Py... ra... -No... Know what? -Pyramid! Pa... ra... si... te! What a genius! Any left? So... -There's Lea. -Yes. -Hi. -Hey! Alright? Yes. OK, OK. So, Adam. -Cole, JB and PA. -Hey. -And Mérou. -Mérou. It's super bitter, but when you have a cold, it's... it's perfect. It's awful! -It's disgusting. -Totally! I'm going to be paying like 900 a month. -Yes. -Utilities included. -Yes. -It's like 50 euros for water and heating. -OK. -Electric heat. At least. Where was it? I got off in some lost town, got off the train, I look down, and there, I see 3g of weed in a roll of bills. I was... I was shocked! Dumb luck, basically! -Fuck, disgusting! -What are you doing? It's gross. -Fucking asshole. -Stop fucking around! Fucking hell. Disgusting. -Oh yeah? Like that? -Fuck. Fuck, my food's soaked now. Shit. You're busting my balls! -Relax! -Wait, what food? Fuck! Are you retarded? -See what he... -What? Seriously, I don't know, but... -Sorry. -It's OK, it's fine. It's not funny. At some point you need to quit! Oh, come on! Anyone have a napkin? You guys are a drag! You're busting my balls. What balls? You don't have any! You have ovaries! I know, you ate them! Right... As before, to get PKA, subtract LOG, decimal logarithm of KA, OK? Just like pH, pH minus LOG of the concentration of H3O+, here, PKA equals minus LOG of the acidity constant. PA? You ignoring me, or what? No. Not going to class? We're waiting for Roshine. She can't do too much, so only comes mornings. She needs a shot every four hours. Can you imagine? Woah. Done. You'll be fine. Fuck, watch where you're going! Hey. Hey. Alright? Good. You? Fuck, you brought people. I told you not to. Hey. -Hi, Franck -Mérou. Hurry up and get in here. -Cole. -Franck. It's freezing. Hurry up, it's freezing. Hey. Hi, Franck. -PA. -Have a seat. What are you playing? The Forest. It's a survival game. My brother loaned it to me. What do you want? Need something? Sure. Got any weed? I got four different ones. Take a look. OK. 25 a bag. And no credit. Not interested in the rest? -No, no. This is fine, thanks. -No? I guess the Poison Ivy looks good. -Looks good, right? -Yeah... Gilbert, you're buying. No, no. -No? -No. -What else you got? -Not even. If you like, I got shrooms if you want, guys. Let's see. Ever try them? Honestly, it's not bad. My brother brought them. -No, honestly, no... -15 a baggie. No, we won't have any money left. -Sure? -Yeah... You should try, because with all the cops around, it's likely I won't get more later. -No, no, no, no... -Come on. Do what you feel. -We can't. -Gilbert. It's our chance. I'd take them if I was you. It's up to you. Could you front us the shrooms? No, no credit. No way. This isn't a supermarket. -No, seriously, we can't. -Your call. Break the 50 for some Northern Light, please. Cool music. What is this? That's my sound, my mix, I mix trackcore. It pounds hard, it moves. How long have you mixed? I mixed for 15 years. -15 years? -Yes. I just stopped, for work, see? Plus, now with the kid and all, I can't do it anymore. You eventually have to get serious. -Right. -Sure, as always. Right... -You OK? -Yes, you? Good. Hey, pass it around? Always taxing, as usual. On the other hand, I... I'm scared to hurt her... in my relationship, with my vision of life, my philosophy. My philosophy is both to be simplistic, but also... a perfectionist. That's why I... My favorite motto is: "Hope for the best and prepare for the worst." With that philosophy... My big problem is that... I master the art of digression, it's all I do. I mean... I go off on one topic, and boom, I end up on another. And obviously, my favorite topic is Chernobyl. You alright? Just having a sit. Can you drink, with your... Your... you know, your thing. Yes, a little. A glass or two. OK. It's kind of a drag at parties. But... At least you never end up totally drunk. Yes... Funny, we never met before. You live in Gex? Yes. Sometimes when I cycle, I... I cross your path. Really? No, I mean, I see you. OK. I don't know, I never saw you. OK. Glad to hear it, thanks. No, don't worry. It's... I'm a pretty discreet guy. Uh... Look at this, an Arapaima caught with a fly. It's... I was going to say it's as big as a missile. It's tired, but even two of us can barely hold on to him. A real missile. Its body is long, hydrodynamic. It's so strong! Some Arapaimas can hit you so powerfully, it will kill you... -Watch out! -Fuck! Shit! The description of nature is today quite complete. Especially after the recent fundamental discoveries done at CERN. But several mysteries are still to be unveiled... ...and particle physics allows us to study these unknown manifestations of nature. What is the origin of the universe? What is the dark matter, invisible and unknown, for which we are seeking possible signs? Where the difference in the amount of matter and anti-matter? Why is there no anti-myself made of anti-matter that just annihilates me? It is then this tiny difference in the quantity of matter and anti-matter that allows this world to exist. The theory of multiple worlds and dimensions tells us that it's possible that so many dimensions and realities can coexist. Likewise, there is a probability that something happens or not. Virtual probable situations, or the probability, they do not materialize, but produce in the infinitely small world all the elemental particles. The questions will ask you to write this line, this line and this one. Three lines. For next time, complete the questions I mentioned earlier. Don't forget to do them for our next class. Push the chairs back under the desks, please. Check for papers on the floor. INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL Why weren't you at the cafeteria? Because the food is shit, and I don't eat shit. Lea was looking for you. She looked sad. So what? So, what's going on with Lea? Who gives a fuck, man. Who cares. Come on, let's get some tacos. No. Come on, let's go. -Come on! -Quit it! -Come on, move it! -No! What's up? You rebelling? I wasn't asking. Off to school. I wasn't asking, come on. -No. -Come on! -Seriously? You staying? -Yes. You're staying? You're staying here? You're not coming? -Come on, man! Get up. -No. What? You're not coming? Fuck. -Serious? -Yes. Piss off! Fucking stooge! -Hey. -Hi. Thanks. Your dad didn't come? No. You can leave your shoes here. You know we're not allowed to have anyone over when Dad's not here. Yes, but I do what I want. You can leave your stuff here if you want. What's your cat's name? That's Tiger. Right, suits him well. Yes, I know. I named him. Well... nicely done. Who's this? My brother. This was you as a child? -Yes. -OK. You were cute. I mean, you still are, but... Thanks. No problem. Don't you want something? I'll just have a little of this. Want a drink? -I'm not hungry. No, I'm fine. -Something to drink? At least you save on food. Great room. Thanks. Your father isn't around? No, he's traveling for work. And your mom? She doesn't live here. She lives in Germany. They... They're divorced? Yes. And living... Sorry. No... I was going to say... Is it hard living without your mom? I don't know. I... Yes, sometimes. But I can't change that. Yes. Sorry. Could I grab your guitar? Sure, go ahead. There. No... Yeah, sorry, it's a bit out of tune. No, don't worry, I can't play. You can't play? That's Mérou's thing. Don't you play in a band together? Yes, with JB and Cole. But no, actually, we're not a band. It's just for fun. So it's basically useless. Well, yes! It's a good time spent with friends. What instrument do you play? Sax, baritone sax. Take those often? Yes, every two hours. Woah, OK. I took drugs too, as a kid. What for? Attention deficit. I was awful with my parents. So much so, that... they couldn't go out with me when I was a kid. I'd space out, and teachers kept yelling at me. That sucks. Yeah. Still take them? No. It's been a while since I quit. But sometimes, well... Strange stuff still goes on in my brain. I see strange things. Sometimes I see weird stuff, too. What's going on? I don't know. The whole neighborhood is out, even the streetlights. Roshine, what happened? The power's out. Give me your hand. We're made up of a tiny amount of matter, surrounded by a lot of energy. It feels like we're touching, but actually, we're not. Holy shit! -Alright? Got it? -Yeah. Yes! A little bridge. We set up the tent, like this. Relaxed. Jeez, it's getting dirty. -There. -There! I'll have to take everything out from the inside... Oh yes! Oh! Oh yeah! OK. Go. So, no need to stir? Nothing? Let's go! OK, let's go. Oh, jeez. I'm not feeling it. Oh, fuck. Hey, here. Fucking hell! Alright, bud? You guys suck. Good luck! Come on, help me out. Give me a hand. -Sit down for a second. -Enough. Sit down for a second! He fell over... Sit down a sec! -What? -Sit down a sec! Sit down a sec! You're freaking me out! Piss off! Fuck you. Shut up. What a lack of respect, I wouldn't have liked that. You're totally high. Seen Mérou around? No. Mérou? Forget it, he must have gone home, or to Lea's. Mérou? -Hello. -Hello. Hello. Hello. Belief is when you affirm something as true without attempting to justify it in any way, according to Kant, a philosopher you've heard of, in the 18th century, as... Yes? Come in. Hello. Everyone stand, please. Have a seat. Pierre-André? Cole and I agreed not to say anything about the shrooms, OK? OK. Pierre-André? Pierre-André? Jansson. -Jans... sen or son? -Son. Son. Great. What's your version? We went camping overnight at Allondon Springs, and... Overnight? Sunday night? Saturday? I don't remember. No, seriously. Saturday? Sunday? Friday? What day, Pierre-André? Your best friend, and you don't know where he went? Nothing. He takes off at night and nothing. You wake up the next day, he's gone, fine. Where's your buddy? Your childhood friend? Where? I... I was confused? Sometimes it's fine, the next it's not? Tell me where you friend is! Where's your friend? I'd have told you if... Any idea where he is? I have no idea. -Hey. -Hey. Antoine? Mérou? Mérou? Antoine? Antoine? Antoine? Antoine? Mérou? Yeah. Good. So, let's stick to the two, and we decide later what we do... if we take a third one or fourth one. Good. Yep! You too, have a nice weekend, have a nice evening and, uh, see you later. Cheers! Want to listen to music? -Just playing. OK, let's go. -Done yet? You done? Come on... Three, two, one... No! It's my new pick. Thank you, wind, that was wonderful. It's my new pick. Thank you, wind, that was wonderful. I'll hit you with it when you open your mouth. It's IRMA, version 2, you know, wow, wow... INTERNATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL CERN LHC POINT SEVEN VERZY AVENUE Go for it. Your stuff must be here. OK? I'll leave you alone. Thank you. What are you doing here? Looking for Franck and Lise. There's no Franck or Lise here. You've made a mistake. Where'd Franck go? Franck? Who's Franck? Your dealer. Jonas? Franck... Come on, I'm not kidding, JB. Franck? Franck, who lives in Pougny. Man, I don't know any Franck in Pougny. You know a supplier named Franck? Are you high? Hello? Hello? Still there? Date of birth? July 9... 1999. OK. -So you're in high school? -Yes. -What grade? -Senior. OK. How's it going? -Fine. -Fine. Do you like high school? -I don't love it. -Mm. Your mother called to make an appointment. You OK with coming? To talk to someone? More or less... What's going on with you right now? You alright? WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU? WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU? What's up? Want to talk about it? I'd rather not. We're moving. Where to? My father wants to go back to Hamburg. He doesn't want to live here anymore. He's flipping out a bit because I've been getting ill. He wants me to see a specialist. Besides, our mother lives there. Apparently, it's better if my brother and I see her more often. But I don't want to leave anymore. You won't tell me? You know... Me too. Sometimes I wake up and the world feels different. Like we're changing and no one notices. Stay with me. Here. I love you. PARTICLES A BLAISE HARRISON FILM Subtitling: Hiventy
