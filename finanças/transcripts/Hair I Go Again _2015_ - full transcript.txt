Heavy metal. Heavy metal is a lifestyle. Fill in the blank. Heavy metal is? Everything. Freedom, being yourself. Groupies, and it's metal that's heavy. Heavy metal... Changed my life. I'm Kyle. I'm Steve. My first concert was Rock Super Bowl Number 10. My first concert was Van Halen off the Van Halen II Tour. I have over 350 concert, band, rock & roll t-shirts in my collection. Yes. I've been Gene Simmons before for Halloween. Yes, the first song I learned on guitar was "Smoke on the Water." Watch out for shit bombs. And I had a skunk named Nicko named after the drummer of Iron Maiden. In another life, I was a rock and roll musician. So you had this band in the '80s. Well, we were a band called Tryxx, T-R-Y-X-X. We wanted to open up for Motley Crue. That was our goal in life. Did Tryxx ever get a taste of the rock star lives? Or was it just you guys practicing some songs, fighting with each other for a little while, and then drinking cheap beer until you passed out? We never really went anywhere. It was really a lot of potential. We were just out of high school. We just had a really cool band. Aw, I thought it was Loverboy. Almost like Loverboy or something. Loverboy. Maybe a little bit too Loverboy. Along the lines of Loverboy or something like that. You guys remind me of Loverboy. Maybe a little Loverboy. Kind of like a transvestite Loverboy? Do you remember that band, Loverboy? And you guys, you'd break up, or whatever the case? Definitely in the long run it was just about not wanting the same thing. It's almost like we didn't really give it the full effort that it deserved from back then. So you guys, you've put the band together, and you're going to do a gig. And you guys are going to get together? Is that what's going on? You're literally going to take your five guys that were in this band 25 years ago, and you guys want to do a show? Are we reforming a band here? There's a lot worse ways you could waste your time. It depends on how bad you want it. I don't think you guys got a chance in hell. Something will just happen. You'll force it. Or you'll be homeless. Or that. Yeah. If you really want to do it, and if you can convince the other guys. But be realistic. Don't put too much on their plates. They may not be able to digest it all. Hello? Gordon. Hey, what's going on, guys? We're about to start the next part of this process, which is actually us getting together at this point and see if we can actually create some music, and just see what you're thinking and what's going on with you at the moment. To be honest with you, I'm just completely not wanting to do it. OK. The 80's were wild, and the people that made that scene were wild. The era itself was something that was really special. It was electric. Santa Monica Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard... It was thousands of people walking down the streets. The Strip was the place to be, because of the community. Everybody knew that The Strip was legendary, so everybody flocked to those three blocks. Tonight we have metal on The Strip! Yeah! It was a party. It was a literal 24/7 party. The economy was booming, and it was all about fashion. Girls were wild. Record companies had money, and it was a party time. Everybody was walking around with big hair, and I think it was the volume of hair though. It was the height. It was just how high you could get your hair. So it was really a really happy time for everyone, not only for the economy, but also for the music industry and for the fans. Cinderella. Yeah! Woo! Loud guitars. I'm going to sing at the top of my lungs. You're going to play as fast as you can. We're going to do huge background vocals. That's what we're going to do. I'm like bang. It was different. The rules were different. Artists and bands were able to be who they wanted to be and design their own thing. There were no rules. A lot of money involved. Everybody's career was involved, and things were going really, really well. Just letting your hair down, literally. Ha. That part of it was sobering. Nothing else was sobering, but that was. The LA scene was transferring over to Tampa, and it was more or less because of Julliet and their association with Kevin DuBrow. I met Kevin here in Tampa, and I played him my demo. When he was the biggest rock star in the world, he picked me. Rock talk take a stand. No restriction... I remember watching those guys and thinking wow, wonder they get that Spandex. Wonder where they get their eyeliner. We were trying to get attention. It wasn't like we weren't, so bring it on. They were really the band that brought the LA thing over, and it lit on fire. We had a great scene. It was unbelievable. It had more metal bands per square inch than any city in America. There was music everywhere. There were venues everywhere. Tampa definitely felt like a second home to us if not a first home, because it was such an awesome rock market. I remember back in the day, Florida was a great place to play. And I wouldn't say we were solely responsible for it, but we kinda put Tampa on the map, as far as there's some metal in this town. On one hand on our walls, we had pictures of Motley Crue, and Judas Priest, and Dokken, and we were heavily influenced by them but as far as performers, I would say that we were probably more influenced by the local bands that we saw than anything else. There was a great rock and roll band there called Stranger, and we used to cover one of their songs. It was called "Jackie's So Bad." The classic Florida whiskey drinking, Okeechobee River, South Florida type of band. We made friends, and I think that part really helped us step up and be a little different, than other bands. I always felt that Tampa Bay, it was great for the people. The fans was incredible, and there were some nice, big rock clubs in the area. Oh, we have The Mark Twain, which was the legendary Tampa Club. ML Chasers. Club 19. The Power Club. 49th Street Mining Company. The Rock-it Club. The Rock-it Club. The Rock-it Club? The Rock-it Club. The Rock-it Club, yes. There was a lot going on all the time, and we were in the middle of it all. We could only see what we were exposed to because of our age. So we weren't quite at the age of being able to go into clubs, at least legally. We would sneak into a lot of the clubs, just so we could see these bands live. It was a very, very rich musical landscape that we came from. There were great bands playing there that we were influenced by; Savatage, Roxx Gang, Julliet, Stranger. All those guys were hitting their heyday in Tampa when we were starting our band. So Kyle and I met on this very field in the seventh grade. It was Tuesday, January 15, 1980. Are you serious? Yeah. How do you know that? I just remember. This is where I guess our friendship started. He was like the new kid in school. He'd just moved into town or something. Apparently, I was the first person he met. I don't remember that. I guess it wasn't that eventful. It was Coach Long's PE class. So 100 degrees in Florida, and they're making us play soccer. I wasn't playing soccer. I was just standing there. They can't make me play soccer. I walked up, and I said hi, and you just went... just shook me off. We instantly didn't like each other. The irony is is that in eighth grade, you were voted most friendly, and you did not demonstrate that that day. Somehow, we became friends after all that. And 35 years later, here we are. Are they brewing the beer, or we have to get up and serve ourselves? Or what's going on? You liked... oh, what was the band's name? Lynyrd Skynyrd? No? I don't know. Then when the yearbook photos came around I decided to be Bruce Dickinson, and I made it in the yearbook as Bruce Dickinson. Can you pinpoint when this band started and how it started? How our band started? Mhm. No. I don't remember. I don't remember. Our first band together was formed in 1984, and we were called Convict. That is the most metal fucking name. Heh. My parents were not into the look that I wanted and the music I wanted to listen to. You liked Bon Jovi. I know you liked Bon Jovi. Yeah. He thought he was Bon Jovi. Yeah. Permed yours. Permed yours. Yeah. Oh, yeah. The perms were good. It was all about school. It didn't matter what I wanted to do on any level. It was about school. The less they supported me, the more I wanted to do it. It was just don't tell me I can't do this. My room was decorated. There was not an inch of wall space on my room that you could see... Posters, albums. Every imaginable band was up there on the walls. We were already listening to the music. We were already buying the records. We were already going to the concerts, so what's the next logical step? I think it would be to form a band ourselves. Our parents thought we were crazy. We didn't like that type of music. I didn't like that type of music. It was very loud. I've saved every rehearsal tape... everything. We have cops knocking on the door of our warehouse. Shut it down now. Oh, come on. You guys have been warned a few times. Warned? You know it's pretty late, and these people around here have gotta sleep. And what's the latest time? 7 o'clock. 7 o'clock? Our first show was a train wreck. It was a self-produced gig that we did at a skating rink. I did a two tier Battle Of The Bands, had too much better bands going after each other, and then three lesser bands, including ourselves, going after each other. Remember, it was the Battle of the Bands. I don't remember. It was the Battle of the Bands. It was two divisions. Two divisions? There was a novice division, which included us. We were novice? What the hell? It wasn't too hard for us to win that Battle of the Bands, as bad as we were, because when you pick your own competition, that's what happens. And that it was really kind of what it was. It was the very first show, and there were jitters. We looked cool, and the crowd responded, because we looked a lot better than we sounded. The old Superskate now Jack Joyner Heating and Air Conditioning. Right there is where the bra in teeth photo was taken. And the first show ever played. Right here. I wonder if Jack Joyner would have liked it. Well, Convict, after a couple of shows, started to fall apart at the seams, number one. So we had some personnel changes. What was the name of the band? It's like Max Factor, or like... What do I think of that name? Moxie Men, or let's see. The first thing I think of is a guy that gets a prostitute. Right? Yeah. There's definitely an X in your name. How about two? Am I right with an X? Yes. I am? You are. Styx? I told you. No. Tryxx, and I'll spell it for you, T-R-Y-X-X. Not so great. I love that name. I love the name Tryxx. It's great, T-R-Y-X-X. It's awesome. You've got to think about adding a third X. Triple XXX. The name of the band is Tryxx, but it wasn't really Tryxx, unless there were two Xs... Or three, if you really wanted to underline it and do the whole triple XXX porn thing. I'm trying to figure out which one you is. Can I have this? Is that you? Is that you? I can see it. I can see it. It's cool, the double X? Yeah, it's cool. Come on. Is that you? It sounds very '80s. Come on. That's you there? It just screams of a time. I certainly hate to rain on anybody's parade, but it seems a little contrived maybe. You probably have to add something to it. Good. I like that. Like Tryxx For Free, or Tryxx $5, or something like that. Again, if I got a package that said Tryxx on it, I'd be... I might want to listen to it, just because I'd be like you've got to be kidding me. Tryxx was Gordon on lead guitar, Kyle as the lead singer, myself, Steve, as the rhythm guitarist, J.T. on bass, and Jeff on drums. I was trying to steer us in a direction of becoming a club band, where we were doing 40 songs a night. I think beyond that, to become an original band. I think the originals that you guys did were really cool. You guys wrote hooks. Did we have potential to continue to play skating rinks and things like that? Sure. Potential to make a record and go on tour? Probably not. For a bunch of kids our age, we're talking 17, 18, 19, years old and starting to write our own material was saying something. And maybe I'm the only one that thinks that we had something, but we did. A little something. No, we had something. As an '80s hair band, I think T-R-Y-X-X is close to some friends of mine in Trixter. Oh, you mean Trixter? Now, there's another band called Trixter. What about Trixter? It sounds really like Trixter. It's kind of half ass-ed, don't you think? It's not finished. It's not finished. It explains why you gave it up. But Tryxx is good for an '80s hair band. For something now? No. That is a very rocking name... very rocking. Well, you think that will fly today? Absolutely not. Did you guys talk to the other guys in the band? Where the hell is everybody? We still need to go and find some of the guys. We don't even know where they are. And then see if they want to actually do it. From Detroit, Michigan, Mr. J.T. LeNoir. J.T., I think him and I got along immediately. He was the chick magnet of the band. I don't remember much about his bass playing, to be honest with you. I don't recall if he was good, if he was not good. I think he did the job. He lightened it up a little bit for us, I think. He was a really nice guy. He was a lot of fun to hang out with. We should go look for him, and then if we can find a phone number, call him. The obvious place to start is Facebook. Is that him? No. What are you, blind or stupid? Is that him? Is that him? Is that him? What if you just use that right there? Shut it! Gordon, who was our lead guitar player, was my roommate back in the day, and it was because of him that this band really got started. I just remember he had a great sound to his guitar. He was quietly pissed off, very withdrawn, but he was a brilliant guitar player. I would have probably went for the open, no shirt man right here, with the chest hair. This guy right here? Who's this? That's Gordon. He's our lead guitar player. Gordon's super cute. We are in the process of seeking people out and trying to best as we can put that band together. Right, right. And we would very much like to know if you might be interested in pursuing that road and see what happens. Well, the only real issue that I have with it is basically some mental health issues, anxiety and panic issues. That would be the thing holding me back. I certainly wouldn't have any problem hooking up with you guys. I think it would be cool if we did it... I don't know if it's feasible or not, but if we could work out maybe some original material instead of just playing the old... No. That's the idea, actually. Yeah. That would be cool. As far as me being able to get up on stage and not lose it, that concerns me. Well, I'll tell you what. We plan on doing this thing, and we don't know how long it's going to take to do it. Right. You don't know where it's going to go. It may not go anywhere. Right. Well, that's what my question was. It was like well, can Jeff still play drums? I think he's got a pretty good career going. I'm not really sure what happened to J.T. That is the... currently where are they now file? Yeah, exactly. Is that him? That's not him, but that's him. Is this him? That's him. Mhm. And his wife. Do you want to friend him? No. We should call him. We found J.T. in Michigan, but we can't find a phone number, so I have to pay for his fucking phone number, which just thrills me. How much is that? $1.95. What if it's a wrong number? Then I'm out a buck 95. Oh, well. The number you have reached, 2-1-4... If we don't get through, this will be the fifth phone number. The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the number and dial again. We could friend him on Facebook, man, but I don't want to chase him off. Done. Hello? Hello, is this J.T., former bass player of Tryxx? Yeah. How are you doing, man? Well, we do have a reason for our call. What's that? We're putting the band back together, and we're making a film about it. Are you in? Yeah. I'm in, but I don't know how I'd work it out... We'll work out the details when we get to that point. But right now, we're just rounding up the guys. Hello? Is Jeff B. Heinz there? This is him. Jeff? Boy, we tainted that guy's high school, I think, since he was the youngest one in the band. Jeff, think back to 1986, and what band you were playing in back then. Uhhh '86? Arguably, the best drummer I ever played with. Do you remember the band? '86 would have been... He just had this instinct more than anything else. It wasn't flashy. It wasn't a style thing. It was instinct. I remember the band. Is this Steve McClure? It sure as hell is, and Kyle Kruger, Esq. Oh, my lord. What's up, man? How are you doing, dude? Hey, man. I'm doing all right. I think he was just in it for fun, more than anything else. Putting the band back together? Are we going on tour? Are you in? I mean, if you're going to do the whole thing and going somewhere to play a gig, I'll do it. Nice. Sweet. All right. That's all we wanted to hear, man. All right, man. It's been great. It's good to see you. Yeah. You too man, great. You guys take it easy. All right. See you. Bye. All right. Take care. Talk to you, Jeff. Good talking to you. Thanks, guys. Take care. See you. Bye bye. Later. He didn't even remember the band. I think it's impossible to break into the music business. I mean no one buys records anymore. And to do it and make a living at it is next to impossible. It's a coin toss. The music business is a coin toss. No matter how good you are or no matter how good you're not, sometimes you hit it, and sometimes you don't. Most don't. Have you heard the news... The idea of I'm going to write some songs, date a supermodel, and then I'm going to get signed... That's a pretty iffy business model. People don't buy CDs, man. They don't buy CDs. You sells 25,000 records, and you're number one. You're still broke, but you're number one. What does that get you? You're the number one broke guy. Nobody's making any money anymore, and it's only the select few that you constantly hear on the radio. It's the same bands played over and over again. To try to break a new artist is insane. The music business now is so incredibly diluted. There's so much out there. Back in the day, there was a lot of people that gambled a little bit more and threw money around. Today, they don't do it anymore, and so in today's world, the bands have to be smarter than ever. It's not like it used to be where you got a record company that's going to give you all this money, and put a bunch of tons of money into you, and make sure you get radio play, and everything else. There's no record stores anymore. It's a whole different animal. It's tough man. Nobody sells records. Nobody buys CDs. Why would you, when you can get it for free? Look, business is tough, regardless of what kind it is. But the music business now, it's definitely more of an uphill battle than it's ever been. The record companies are down to skeleton staffs. There's no promotion people there working your record. They're waiting for the band to go out and do it on their own. The problem right now, the enemy I think is just because of Pro Tools and all these kinds of... there's so much music out there, and there's so much music that's good. And I think personally, you're better off being horrible because at least something horrible, I'm going to go whoa. That was so bad, you've got to hear this. You have to get this many downloads to make minimum wage. Seriously, an artist doesn't even make minimum wage. You can make more money at McDonald's. So we're packing up and heading off to see J.T., who we haven't seen in 25 years. So we're going to talk to him about what's in the future for us, and what his involvement is going to be, and how we can get things moving again. So we're off to Flint, Michigan. Please make sure all carry on luggage is completely stowed underneath the seat in front of you. Roll 'em up. While we're in Detroit, I gotta make a pit stop. Where? I gotta pick up a package from a guy. I think he's up here, on the corner, but it won't take long. Oh, look at those people. Oh, that looks a little sketchy. Let's get... Hey. What's up, dude? How are you doing? Hello. Long time no see, man. And I don't owe you shit, by the way. For the last 25 years, he has been bitching and moaning about you owing him $100. And then yesterday he had this epiphany. Oh, wait a second. That wasn't him. Thanks for having us over. Yeah, man. Thanks for coming. Kind of a long trip. Has it really been 26 years? Well, we actually broke up in 1987, and I think it was... And what happened? It was March. I really don't know why we broke up. We talked a lot about me and Kyle fighting, and that was it. I do remember going to the warehouse, packing up my shit, and leaving before a show. This one's going out to a certain person... He knows who he is... who screwed over a certain band, a certain two weeks ago before a certain show. We never had really good dynamics. Because we were always just playing covers, man. Yeah, but we were playing our own stuff. Oh, there were like three songs, and they were all shit. They weren't shit. Yes, they were. Coming from somebody who didn't write them? Really, like I didn't write the chorus for "Eyes Of Fire?" Yes, I believe I did. Oh wait, no. The fuck I didn't. You played three chords. I wrote the chorus. You did not. I wrote the guitar part for the chorus. That's not the song. It is not the song. Yes, it is. No, it's not. Was it part of the song? It's three chords, man. Really? Don't knock yourself out. OK. It's not the vocal melody. I still wrote it. You're acting like you wrote that whole song, and that's not the case. It's called a collaboration. Not at all. Yes. No. All I do is stare - - This song's pretty terrible too. It had potential. Eyes of fire. Eyes of fire. You know what? For our very first song that we ever wrote, this wasn't too bad. Eyes of fire. They let you know it was all your fault. You're such a liar when you never heard my call. I would rate our talent level, on a scale of 1 to 10, about 2 back then. Probably a 6. We were awful, all of us. Here we go. Stare! That was almost on key. Can you smile? Cheese. Cheese. Cheese. Go cheeseburger. Cheeseburger. Cheeseburger. My family is 100 % supportive of me, and my goals, and my love of music. I met my wife here. I was a waitress. And he was, of course, the sound guy. And I had a big crush on him. Everyone went and told him, and the rest was history. After Gibson was born, I took an inventory of what I was doing and where things were going. And although I love what I do now, it's not the most stable thing in the world. He's been here for about 10 years now working here, so 10 long, miserable years with him. Daddy's not so tight anymore. It's in there somewhere though. But I'm going back to school for computer networking. I didn't really know exactly what area of computers I wanted to get into. I just knew that I wanted to get more training in the computer industry. It's also an exciting prospect to be able to get into something a little more stable, a little more structured so that I could spend more time being the normal dad, I guess. I just like the idea of him getting in there and playing more now, picking up his bass again instead of it just sitting there, because I know he enjoys it. That's going to be the hardest part for me is coming up with the time between school, work, being a dad, spending time rehearsing songs. It's going to be tough, but I'm confident that I can find the time that I need to do it. We haven't seen Jeff since 1987. This is really to reunite with him and just to get to know him again. And so we're going to go there to North Carolina, and we're going to reintroduce this idea, lay out the framework of what the plan is, and see if he isn't willing to do that. Are you in a band, sir? Trying. OK. I thought so. You've got the look. All right. Rock on. Our job in all of this is to talk them into doing something they're never going to get an opportunity to do again. 24... Something. 95. Is that it? Yeah. Sweet. McClure! Jeff B. Heinz Kruger! What's going Kyle? Steve man, how you doing, buddy? Good to see you. Been a long time. Hello, brother. Long time. How y'all doing? I'm doing good. 20 however years later? 20... 26... 27. Do you remember how we even all got together and where? I wanted to say it was just like... And I can't remember obviously the name of the garages or anything like that, but there was that garage... Clearwater Self Storage. Clearwater Self Storage, yes. Was it Clearwater Self Storage? It probably changed names. This is where Tryxx was born. Why are you doing that? It's stupid. Right now, I'm going take this time out to introduce you to Tryxx. In back with me on the drum kits, the adolescent mad man himself, Mr. Jeff B. Heinz. Yeah! We didn't know it was being filmed at the time. Jeff B. Heinz. The best I ever was right there. Sit down. Yeah! It was great. It was a good show. Everybody dressed up. There was lights. There was big PA, and it was the thunder. I thought it was fun. I thought that we were working hard, and we were getting better, and you never know where it could have gone. This will be the high point of the trip, actually. OptiStok is as a company that I have started. I'm an entrepreneur, and I've been working on it for over a year and a half. This is the most challenging time in my life, period. I'm all in. I'm all in terms of savings, in terms of my IRA, in terms of everything I've ever saved in my entire life. It's all in. If we can make this work, is it something to dabble in, something to consider? With him in the middle of a business that's been a long haul and he's coming towards the end of whether it's really going to happen or not, timing couldn't be worse. Just to be honest, it couldn't be worse. It's tough. It's a very tough time to making that work, keeping my wife calm somehow and happy when she's really overwhelmed by the situation that we're in. You think his family would be supportive of that? This side of his family. As his brother, I would be very supportive. I don't know. It's a tough situation. But like I said, I explained to her. I said hey, these guys are chasing what they want to do in life, and they're going for it. I respect that, and I'm going to try to help them out. He's never gonna do this. Nope. Actually, and it's not... it has nothing to do with him. Well, it has to do with his time. Dude, I don't hear that. I hear something else. That guy wants to play drums, man. I can tell you that right now. He kept using the word, I'll help you guys out. What does that mean? Because yesterday, he was using the we. So is like the end game of what we're doing here is are we going to get together and play some gig? Are we going to play the Tryxx... Is that what we're going for here? It went from we to I'll support you in any way I can. Basically, I can't commit anything to you, which is fine, because the commitment part is hard when we don't really know where we're at and where we're going. But dude, I don't think it's a lack of wanting to do it. We're all living on piano wires, and so any discussion of something I'm going to do frivolous in the future like that just could set her off. He didn't tell her the whole thing. Yeah. He knows what we're doing. He's holding back. He did not tell her what we were doing. I was hoping, like, him just getting back behind that kit would spark some interest and stuff. The fear that he has in his life overrides all of that. Don't ever say I should've. How many people get the opportunity to go back in time and do it again? It really all depends on whether or not you love doing what you're doing. No should've, could have's. Like do it, follow it, follow you heart, you'll be good. If you don't pursue this dream, give it all you've got, and have fun with it, and enjoy it, and it's building experience for you, then it's all for nothing. Of course it's a good idea. Yeah. You bet. It's the most important thing in your life. Don't take it too seriously. Yeah. That's what I was thinking. And then leave me with a smile on your face. You got the attitude. You've got the hunger. You've got the drive. You guys will be fine, just fine. If you guys want to basically put your band back together, it should be for this reason, and this reason only. Make sure you're doing it with friends, and you're doing it for fun. Yeah. Fun, exactly. Life could be a bitch if you don't have a dream. If you still have the passion and the fire for the music, you guys are still friends, you felt like you had something special back then, then why not? You have do it, because it's in your heart. It's in your blood. It's what you're meant to do. But the biggest thing is man, don't ever give up on your dreams man, because if you do, you're going to kick yourself in the butt one day and go, god. Why didn't I just try, at least? Hello? Gordon. Hey, what's going on guys? We would love to play some music with you. I am chomping at the bit. That's what it comes down to. It's like man, we want to give it another shot, and we want to do with the original guys, so it wouldn't be the same. When are you going to get the chance to do this again? To do this? I'm not. It wasn't really a great time in my life. It's just something I'd just rather not relive. I just really don't want to be involved with anything I've done in the past. And I was like a fish out of water, and I think it would be the same thing all over again. Gordon plays Death Metal. He's in a band called Never To Arise, and they just released their first record. And if I do have a career in this going, which I don't know that I even do, because I'm not going to be that pretentious or egotistical to say that I do. But if I did, I could see this killing it. Where does it fall in the priority level? Where it has to. Not where I'd like it. To be honest, I'd like to be able to give it a much higher priority. But realistically, I can't. I've got other priorities now. This is probably not going to be on the discussion table. I can't even discuss this with my family right now. I won't discuss this with my family. I don't want to mislead you on anything, or string you along on something that my heart's just not into. Mhm. I can't let it inconvenience my family at all. I can't. So I wish you guys all the success in the world and everything, and I can understand why you're doing it, but I just don't have that feeling myself to do it. Can I make it work? No. That's your guys' job. It was good hanging out with you, man. Yeah. Yeah, it's been great, man. I really appreciate you guys taking the time to fly out for me and everything. All right, dude. We'll talk to you. All right, man. See you. All right. Take care, guys. Bye bye. Bye. Told you. You knew that was coming. I saw it coming a mile a fucking away. All right. Gordon says no, screw it. I don't want to do it. Then we're done. No, we're not done. That's it. He says no, and the whole thing is just off the table? Who are we going to get to play? Can't he do his metal on the side and play with you guys too? Oh, he's thinking about he's going to look bad doing it? If I were you, if you had that situation that somebody was in your band and they felt like it was embarrassing to be in your band, I would take it personally. I'd be like go. Get. We need somebody else. As long as you guys are all in, there can't be anybody that's like well, I don't know. I'm on the fence. Don't get wrapped up in the one guy who doesn't want to do it. If they don't want to play like you guys want to play, then why do it? If you have a history with somebody that's very influential, and very artistic, and has been a major part of what you do, when they're gone, there is no way to replace them. You have to just carry on, and you're a different band. You're a different band dynamic at that point. The bottom line is if everybody says no to it or you can't get everybody to agree, you've lost nothing. You're exactly where you're at now. We started this thing, and who would have thought how difficult it would be just to get five guys back together again? Everybody's got lives to live, and everybody's got money to make, and bills to pay, and I get that. But man, what if you put yourself in a position... This is the reason why the band broke up in the first place. It's the same, exact reason. Life got in the way. Realistically speaking, I've come to the realization that this ain't going to happen, at least the way we want it to happen. Steve and I have reached the point where we need to move forward with something, and if these guys, if their heart just isn't into doing it, and we're having to do all the leg work to make it happen, then we want to make something happen that's on a more grand scale, and we want to be able to play with people who want to play first and foremost, and then maybe make something happen out of it. So I found a local guitar instructor, and this guy can shred. So I'm about to take my first lesson in a quarter of a century. It's going to be interesting. Let's just hope I don't embarrass myself. Pick it up. Start playing. Yeah. Come on, Smoke On The Water or something. I mentioned that I haven't picked up a guitar in 20 years too, right? So you suck right now. But it's like riding a bike. It's like riding a bicycle. It's like riding a bike. No, it is like riding a bike though. It's like riding a bike, man. It's not like riding a bicycle. I don't think I'm at pure bottom beginner level. Like I never picked up a guitar. I remember some chords and things like that, but I might be a little bit above that. Whoa. Let's do this. All right. Let's do this. All right. Are you ready to sing? Yes. It could serve you well to go to a vocal coach. That's not a bad idea. Let's start nice and simple, and then keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing out of your comfort zone. Feet shoulder length apart, toes pointing straight ahead. Shoulder length apart. Hands out of your pockets. Loosen up a little bit. You've got to be loose, man. You can't be all tight. We're going to start with the diaphragm. As far as note values, do you understand what whole notes, half notes, quarter notes, stuff like that are? It's been... no, not really. Take a deep breath. Now, keep the rib cage out, but let the breath out. Exhale while keeping the rib cage expanding. I forgot where I'm at already. It's too many, isn't it? No, that was right. OK. 1, 2, 3, and 4. And 4. Extend your rib cage a little bit. Let some air out, and hit me some As. A, A, A, Aiiiiiiyyy! A, A, A, Ayyy. It's raspy. It's raspy. No air. You have too much air coming. Practicing, this stuff, even the easy stuff, getting them up as fast as you can, every single one, along with the foot tapping is going to be a huge benefit to improving as fast as you can in the shortest amount of time. 1, 2, and 3, 4. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. A, A. Yes. A, A, Ayyy. That's better already. A, A, A, Ayyyy. Good, good. Nailed that one. And when you hear something like how did I do that and you do it again, it's a matter of repetitive motion, like a guitar player doing this, playing the same solo every night. You can repeat the things that work for you and continue to put them in the place. That's your ammunition. That's your vocabulary, your vocal vocabulary. And everything right now seems like you definitely built some good foundation into your subconscious back in the '80s. And it's still there, so that's good. So I think we're definitely on a good path. All right. So it's like riding a bike, right? I haven't ridden a bike in years. What's up, man? What's up, brother? How are you doing? Good man. All right. Good to see you. So Steve and I have worked really hard over the last couple of years and have decided that we're going to go ahead and move forward, because you know what? This is our freaking dream, and we're not going to hold back because we weren't able to accomplish the sentimental part of what is that we wanted to do. Where that leaves us is that Steve and I are left with having to start over in that well, we need to put a band together, first off. We want to throw that out at you first off just to gauge the interest, something that we can work around schedules. And again, it's a process. It'll take us six months. And the minute you said XYZ was off the books playing live, I'm like... Yeah. He's around. Opportunity knocks. Answer the door. Are you there? Let's make this work, man. Let's do it. Rock and Roll. I dig you though, man. That's why. Right on, brother. Cool. Yeah. It's going to be great. Right on. Pretty much I'm completely available right now. OK. So whatever day is good for you. I will work on this as often as you want to. I'm going to put that in your court only in saying that if we can get together on the average of at least once a week. Hey. This is Tony. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Tony, it's Kyle. Just checking in, man. Steve is back from being out of town, and we wanted to see what your availability was looking like, because we want to start making some music, man. Hey. This is Tony. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Hey. This is Tony. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. There's not a fucking person on this planet who has any fucking sense of urgency or gives a fuck what we're doing. People who commit to doing something and then fucking flake, and I've fucking had it. This is a culmination of everybody from J.T., and Gordon, to all the way up the line. People who said yes, but either haven't put forth any effort or any support, or who just plain out flaked on us, and it's frustrating as hell. I realize this isn't everybody's dream. I get that. But if I say I'm going to do something, I fucking do it. Hi there. This message is for Kyle Kruger. This call is from a debt collector. This call is from a debt collector. If you would please contact this office as soon as possible. I'm calling to notify you that there will be two charges filed against you in your county. I've been out of work for 17 months. I've got bills to pay, and I don't know how I'm going to pay them. Steve, you're selling your house. Yeah. This is a huge mid-life crisis. Well, it's a mid-life challenge. Quit all your jobs. Yes. Because you're not going to have time for the band if you have a full time day gig. So no, I'm just kidding. I wouldn't give up the day job. I wouldn't do it. We both quit our jobs last year. You've given up your careers? Everything. So is that a good idea? No. No. Is this going to be your livelihood, or are you going to quit your day job, or what? Already quit the day job. Too late for that? Already quit the day job. You already quit the day... so it sounds like it better be a good thing. I think it's crazy in the current financial environment this country's in to just up and leave your job. It's a huge risk. It's all about sacrifice. You've got to sacrifice, I mean, everything. To pick up and stop what you're doing. You guys are crazy motherfuckers, man. I have been making money. Not a lot, but I've been making enough to keep gas in the car. Selling plasma? Yes. How'd you know? Are you serious? How did you know? You are not serious. Well, I am. Whoever said oh, yeah, chase your dreams, go for it didn't know how fucking expensive it is. So this is where we're at right now. This is where I'm at, at least. I have a dream, and this is the reason why I'm doing this, and that is to record with these guys, to make a full on record and put it out there, and see who freaking salutes. Now is the time to do it, because right around the corner could be hip replacement surgery. If it's in your heart, and you know that there's nothing else you want to do more than make music, then you should go for it. Honestly, I'm not that excited about playing music yet, and I know that's due to a lack of confidence in my own abilities. If you go into it scared, I don't think it works. Go for it. Don't ask yourself any questions. There are no challenges. Challenges are for losers. Have you all been a room together yet? Hitting that first note sounds like it's a problem right now. How is it that... let's see. We've known each other since 1980. We haven't played together since 1986 or '87. How is it that we've never played any fucking music together? How is that? Are we tuned the same? It's like the old times. You haven't played in a while, and I learned to play differently. So this is going to be interesting for me, at least, to see what kind of sound we end up coming with. I've got about 25, 26 things I'm working on. And I haven't finished anything, and there's a reason for that, that I wanted to just run some ideas by you, see what resonated with you. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. 2, 3, 4. What you really have to concentrate on is the music and make sure that you like the music that you're playing, because if you don't like the music that you're playing, you can't expect anybody else to like it, because it's not going to be believable. Well you're doing it for you, and that means what's going to come out is going to be the real deal, a real product. Yeah. Whether it's good or not anybody else isn't going to matter. You guys do what you meant to finish. Do what you love. Don't do what you think people are going to love. Do what you love. Stay true to your heart. Even though all of these ideas aren't fully realized, I feel really good about where they're going. I'm in a place I haven't been in years creatively, so I think it's just a matter of us getting on the same page. 12, 3, 4. You have to write great songs. It all starts with a great song. You have to work for it. You have to focus like a laser beam, and it starts with the music. Go to F. Huh? Going to go to D after F? From an E to the G? One more time. Stay with the rhythm though. God damn it! You stopped playing in '87. Doesn't matter, man. I considered myself at least holding decent rhythm back then, so I can't even fucking do it now. It just takes practice. That breaks a lot of people, is those struggling periods, because a lot of people are like fuck, this is not worth it. Slow it down a little bit. Yeah. This whole process has suddenly become really frustrating, and it's difficult for me to play right now. If you believe in you, they, meaning the public, will believe in you. But it's all going to start with one individual... you. Do it because you mean it, and get out there, and show people you mean it, and they'll buy that. My abilities back then obviously weren't anything to write home about. So I'm having a tough time of it right now. But the problem is a lot of guys get up there. And they become frustrated, because they can't play the way that they used to play. And then now it becomes more of they're bummed out. They're like fuck, I used to throw down hard, and now, I can't. So it takes the fun out of it for them, and that leads them not wanting to practice more. It's just like fuck, it's not fun. Now you don't know where to go from there, because we never really got that far. You better really want it, because you're going to be challenged. You better fucking look at yourself in the mirror and say, do you really want this? Because it's going to come at you. Well, after we interviewed Ron Keel, we stayed in touch, became good friends. He invited me on stage with him at Monsters of Rock Cruise. And after that, he asked me to sing on his record. Yes, hi. This is Ron. Hey Ron. It's Kyle and Steve. Hello, Kyle and Steve. Welcome to Las Vegas! I guess the idea is to come in, and I'm going to do some stuff with you? I'm not as familiar enough with your voice, your range, your tone. You've got all of that to be able to assign you a particular part. I'll just be there, and you just plug me in and say hey, can you do this? And I'll try it. And if I can, I can. If I can't, then we'll find something that works. I certainly hope it goes a lot better than that voice lesson that we did a while back. Your stomach's going to be tight. You're going to have to do some crunches, but you've got be able to... What makes you think I don't do crunches already? I'm just saying. What makes you think I don't do crunches? I'm not talking about Captain Crunches. I want him to contribute something in a significant way to the record. I want something that he can be proud of, something that he's going to be able to listen to and say, I did that. I don't have to prove anything to anybody, because I haven't been doing this for 25 years. So if I go in there, and I'm moderately OK, I'll be happy with that. We're going to do a song called "Long Gone Bad," and we're going to do a unison lead vocal in the chorus with Ron Keel, Paul Shortino, and Kyle Kruger. Long gone bad, too far too fast. Ain't no use living in the past. I've already blown every chance I had. Long gone bad. Just count us in like you did. That's really cool, because we don't know where we're at. Ain't that the truth? Me in between Shortino and Keel? Are you fucking kidding me? I've already blown every chance I had. Long gone bad. Again. It's getting better. Long gone bad. Long gone bad. The melody's got to be precise. Long gone bad too far too fast. Ain't no use living in the past. Let's give Kyle a shot at doing this by himself, all right? Long gone bad too far too fast. Ain't no use living... Sorry. Already blown every chance I had. Don't read it. Sell it. I've already blown it... god, I keep wanting to stretch that out for some reason. Life is over, man. Everything fucking sucks. I've already blown every chance I had! Long gone bad. Fuck this! Just give him one second. Come on. Oh, get down. It's the emphasis. Oh that there that's just the music Just music. Really? Drink that. No, I'm good. I'm good. Ah. I'm good, man. Drink this! No, it's just... I've already blown every chance I had. Long gone bad. Almost. Long gone bad too far, too fast. Ain't no use living in the past. I've already blown every chance I had. Long gone bad. That sounded good. That did sound great. Can I hear that back on the phones, please? Long gone bad. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Cool. For a song you've never heard, and just jumping into it. Now we're really going to start working. He gave me a track, and I've been studying it, and I came up with my own part. And I told him about it. He said he was cool with that. We'll see how it works. Evil, wicked, mean, and nasty. What do you got going for me, Kyle? What have I got? I want to be the devil in this. I want to be the wicked, so the low... Grr. Let's play it. Play it. 3, 4... Evil, wicked, mean, and nasty. Nice. Evil, wicked, mean, and nasty. I like it. Evil, wicked, mean, and nasty. No, I'm really proud of Kyle. He did a great job, and I threw some stuff at him that he wasn't expecting. He threw some stuff at me that I wasn't expecting. That chorus, that low third harmony that he did, brings out the evil, and the wicked, and the mean, and the nasty in the song. Other than that, it sounds nice. How are you? Great. We don't talk enough. I think we do. I don't think we do. I just got off the phone with the general manager at Peavey. According to them, they want to give us equipment and want to be one of our sponsors. We've worked with Steve Blaze. Right. Just so you know, Stevie Blaze endorses them. You know that whole tonal quality that you're looking for, that's it, right there. And that'd be cool if I reach out to him too and just be like hey, can you give me some pointers as to what I'm looking for to get the sound. We want to make sure that we're knowledgeable about what it is that we're doing, and we're coming out of left field. And to align ourselves with somebody like Blaze, who can really get us dialed in and say this is the direction you need to go. Steve, hey. It's Steve Blaze. What's happening, man? Hey, how are you doing? I'm good. What's going on with you? Well, yeah. I just wanted to chat with you about the Peavey thing. Right. And I know you're endorsed by them, so I just wanted to pick your brain about maybe some of the particular models and stuff that you use and maybe what you could recommend to me for a sound, because I'm pretty much still a novice at this. Sure. Not a problem. Look at this. Acoustically, I'm using their Composite Acoustic guitars. They're made out of carbon fiber. It's an acoustic guitar that never bends, never warps, never sweats, and they sound amazing. How can I get a Steve Blaze tone, sound out of my guitar and amp? You must sever these hands and have them surgically attached to your body. I think tone, for a lot of players, has a lot to do with the individual. I think half of the tone is in the body. It's in the hands. It's in the way that we handle our instruments. I'm using the Triple XXX amps. And they're warm, and they're not too treble-y. I don't differentiate my lead and my heavy rhythm tone. I use the same sound for both, but it's got a great clean sound too. We feel like if we want to play like pros, we need to have pro equipment, why we're having conversations with you guys to help us get to the next step in our process. What is that next step? The biggest hurdle I see for you guys, seriously, is that you weren't a big band back then. So you're coming out like a new band, in a weird way. You don't have a big fan base, do you? Or maybe if you had a name. Maybe if people knew who the fuck you were at one point, then it would be a lot easier. But you've got a fucking rough road, bro. You don't have the same track record to sell the band on. In fact, you have no track record, do you? When you're coming at it from the situation where you've had no previous success and here you are, a bunch of guys at the age you are at trying to get your toe in that water it is so hard. It's a lot tougher now, now that you guys y'know, you waited too long. All right. Ready? All I want is to play some fucking music. The question is is can we fucking deliver? When the tears are gone. When the tears are gone, it's time to cry. Don't you say a word. Just say goodbye. I don't have a voice. Well, I knew that. Stop being a dick, because I'm being dead serious. What does that mean? What, stop being a dick? No. Stop being who you are. What does I don't have a voice mean? Whoaaaa. When the... ah, fuck! Any successful band has a singer that has a voice that stands out and that has something unique about it. And I don't have that. And not that I say that I ever did, but I'm lost in how I approach this material. If it's just kind of a generic singer, then there's too much product out there right now. It's too difficult for them to identify themselves. Good is just noise. So I think the difference is you have to be amazing. You never can be good enough. You can always be tighter. You can always be more dynamic. You can always have better harmonies. What does it mean to you? I just want you to fucking know it like the back of your hand. And the only way you could do that is through either repetition and have the confidence in what you're doing, but having your skill set tuned up to make it so. Yes. It's been a while. It's not been easy, man. I know it's not. I can tell you right now, it hasn't been easy for me, so you need to consider that as well. I am. It's not for the lack of trying. OK. Because I am. I'm taking lessons. I'm doing what I can. All right. So don't question my dedication to it. I'm trying. If you can't nail this song down, you're not going to be able to do anything else. No, I'm being honest with you, because if you don't derive any confidence from working this song out and any motivation from it, you're fucked for the rest of the time. Democracy is bull shit in a rock band. Every band thinks OK. We're all going to have an equal vote, and blah, blah, blah, blah. This never happens. He thinks that I am trying to commandeer everything that's going on. My dedication level is a lot different than his, I think. I don't have a consistent desire to be a musician. I plan on doing something beyond this, if necessary. If you're not all on the same page, then you're going to be butting heads. The only way that something like this works is if you push all in. You're much more into it, I think, than I am and have been all along. I have sacrificed so much to do this. This has been one of those things that has caused me to reexamine who I am in my life, and I want to pursue it to the NTH degree. You don't share that, so what do you get out of it? I guess initially it was a challenge to see if we could do it. That's really why I wanted to do it, to see if we could. Do you feel that you're still on that same path though? Yes? Well, so what's the deal? Dude, I mean, I'll just cut to the chase. I don't want to do this anymore. I think that from where we started and where we've ended up, it just hasn't played out as I would had hoped, and I feel like I've got everything from my end to make it go. And obviously, it's not going anywhere. Of course we're going to ask ourselves every day, is this worth it? Is it worth putting our lives on hold? Is it worth fucking not getting a job? Is it worth practicing every day? Who knows? I don't know. And at one point I'm like fuck, it's probably not. 6, 7, 8. If somebody dropped coin on us tomorrow and we were slated to go in, record in three or four weeks, we wouldn't be able to do it. We couldn't. We just wouldn't be able to do it. And I'm not slamming you, dude. But I just don't think that you have the level of commitment needed to pull this off. I don't think we're on the same page. I don't think we share the same values. We definitely don't have the same goal. From the beginning, him and I had different goals, which was fine. And we knew that from the very beginning. He wanted to say this as far as it could, and I wanted to take it to where we said we were going to go, which was get the band together, play a gig. And that shit didn't happen. We derailed from the original band. We're in some parallel fucking plan. I don't even know. I don't even know what the fuck we're doing. This is a major undertaking, man. Who fucking makes a movie about themselves like this, number one, and puts themselves in a position where they basically have to acquire a fucking skill in the middle of their life? That's insane! And that's where we are. So that means what, are you just interested in taking a break from this? Do you just want it to end? What are you looking to do? I cannot continue going in this direction of nothing happening and living the way that I am. I can't do it anymore. I'm not going to say god, I wish we would have done this differently. I can't change that. What I can change is now looking forward, and I just don't see this going anywhere. I think it's a failure. When you first start off, it's all for one and one for all. And eventually, just as people, we evolve, and you sort of find yourself. That's part of reality in bands. I mean here you are now, just two of you. It's like a marriage times 100. You there? Yep. I just got evicted, so I got to figure out what I'm going to do. Stare, all I do is stare... I've got to figure out a plan. Oh, fuck. I've got a little room and storage. Not a whole lot, but... I'm putting my stuff in storage while I try to find a place to live. Whose storage? Steve's storage. Even my living situation has changed, so there's nothing I can really do to help him at this point. He was either going to be living in his car, or I have a spare room, and I know if I was in the same situation, I would hope somebody would offer that to me. So yeah, Kyle's upstairs. I can admire somebody that takes a risk like that, because I known that there's things that I would love be doing right now that I'm not. Eyes on fire one way windows to the world. Car payment's past due. They shut off my phone. I've got a couple of interviews working... trying to get work. It takes some guts to sacrifice everything to fulfill a dream. Ashes fall like acid rain. I've got to be accountable. I put myself here, but I had a plan, and the plan, a just hasn't reached its end. You never heard. You never were alarmed. And it has me wondering if all of this was worth it at all. We actually had this kind of regular fan email us and said that they wanted to invest in the film, which is the first actual investor. Money is not everything in this life, so to help you guys get to your dream, and it took a little bit of money to get there, and then to have lifelong relationships, that's awesome. It's really exciting to hear that you guys are doing this. And I think if you were interviewing our entire industry, the guys that make guitar amps, and sell guitars. We all wanted to be doing what you're doing now. You're the first person that's come and tried to do this with Peavey, and I think it's exciting, quite frankly. In ear monitor system. So we should have two heads, four straight cabinets, two AT-200 guitars, two acoustic guitars. Nice. Good stuff. Oh, it's definitely on now. Let's just hear that part again coming out of that second chorus. Steve and I both agree that the most important thing that we're going to do at this juncture is to make a record happen. Until you have that, you're not going to get anybody that's going to want to be in your band until they know what kind of music are you? Because what are you going to tell them? We're a rock metal band. There's 6,000 of those. Can't find a guitar player or can't find a bass player? Go hire somebody that's good that you like that he plays his ass off. So what you're saying is you're not ready to commit to our band just yet? Not until I hear some music. You want to hear... Not until I hear some music. All right. All right. We have had it, as part of our plan for a long time, that Ron Keel was going to produce our album. Ron texted me last night with the dates. he got us a studio, and is just working on a couple of other details, but it looks like it's a go. In terms of making the project, in terms of making an album, I will take whatever you've got, whether it's material, music, money, time, and make the most of it. Welcome to Cedar City, Utah. Just make sure you're very well prepared. And if you're not, it'll bite you in the ass. Just make sure whatever you're recording man, that you can reproduce it live, because a lot of people go to shows and they go man, this is not the band that I just listened to on the way to the concert. Do not let the studio intimidate you. Go in there. Rock and roll is not about perfection. Rock and roll is about flaws. That's where some of the great stuff comes from. As a friend of mine told me, have fun. If it's not about having fun, then it's stupid, really. So I'm going to try to have fun. I'm going to do the best I can. I'm going to have fun. Yes, I practiced. Fuck. I'm drunk. If it stops being fun, then it doesn't matter. This is where we'll track the drums, and we'll be in here with them, headphones, tracking together as a band. You're going to love Les, Les Warner from The Cult on drums for this session. Not only has he got platinum and gold on the wall, he's got a platinum heart as well. Great groove, and does his homework. Always has a great attitude and a smile, but he's fearless. Check, check, check, done. Talk back mic. Talk back mic. Let's carve this track. "Gone Again". Leave the space open. 1, 2... That's all the click we need. Wrong chord. Sorry. Yeah. Quarter notes will be kicked out. Once we come in after the second accent, quarter notes on the kick. Again. Again, we've got to watch the timing of the guitars. Yeah. I'm getting lost. A little bit in front. It was a little bit in front. I'm getting lost. That's all. Can't get lost. This isn't rock and roll fantasy camp. We're in the studio making a master here. This is what you guys have staked your whole career on, and come back, and gone through all this sweat, and muscle, and blood to achieve. You guys can't just bail on us like this! Yeah, man. We came in too early. It's not your take. It's his take! I know, but I'm getting lost, Ron. If he's fucking rocking, we don't stop! Pick it back up! Don't bail on us! We're trying to get you a take here! I understand. All right. If he doesn't fuck up, we don't stop! And we're going to delete that take, and then we're going to start again. Here, punch in. Play along. We'll punch in from one in the breakdown, because it's all good up to there. It's good. That's good. It's good. It's good! Ahhh! So I feel it. This is the one! If we'd rehearsed, we would just come in and bang it out. Yeah. But when you're changing things up, it tends to sort of... it'll take a little bit longer, but the main thing is is you get the results at the end of the day that you want. You improve on it, you know what I mean? How'd it go? We've never really been in that type of environment, and then we're playing with a professional drummer. And it just... I don't know. I mean we got by, but it took a long, long time. You're the first drummer that we've played with together since 1987. Really? Yeah. What band were you in in 1987? I was with The Cult. Yeah. That's what I was doing in '87. And getting laid lots. So what's changed since '87? Nothing. All right. Well, here we are, and this is all about the music. The first step is laying down these solid rhythm guitars. You've got to play with the drums. Les Warner did a great job giving us a very strong foundation to build upon. So play with the drums. Have fun with it. Don't be afraid to be fearless, a little reckless. But also, you've got to be precise. Let's do this, brother. 1, 2... Old, my head, it's broken. New words barely spoken. Nothing matters in the end. You guys liked that. You liked that. I don't know. I like it too. You're a fucker, man. All the feeling is gone again. That's money. OK. I think so. Give me the untied again, the first word, untied... Untied. Untied memories. Oh, yeah. Check that. Give it to me one more time. I want enunciation. I want to make sure I know what you're saying. You're going to feel this. Take it back to the inspiration where you wrote the song. The final scene to play out on the screen. I'm keeping that. There's some great stuff there. I'm going to give you another shot at it. Rewind the reel! Let's listen to this take, then we'll start stacking harmonies. Shattered reflections in the lens. Now, you're gotta match that lead vocal in every possible way. All the feeling is gone again. You're gonna do that again. Indeci... No! All the... Feeling... This is some very ambitious shit. Keep in mind, if I'm mixing this thing, if Tom and I are mixing this thing tomorrow and it doesn't work, we're not using it. We're burying it, all right? A producer is really important, because he's taking charge of everything. He's not going to let anything go way beyond what it needs to be. If it's what you want, it's your vision, that's cool. Execute it for me. We'll record it. We're just recording it. I'm just telling you we've got to sing in key. And we've got to be in the right phrasing, and the right notes, and the right phrasing. I'm not dissing the parts, but it's got to sound good. It's got to match. The producer is also a fresh pair of outside ears, because everybody in the band is so personal to their music. The lead vocal is great. And now we're killing it by stacking stuff on top of it that's out of time and out of key. So sing it in time, and sing it in key. I wish I would have known that before we got here, and I would have changed it. But it's in my head, because that's the way that I wrote it. If you're not willing to kill somebody over what you believe in, then you're not involved, invested in what you're doing in the first place. That doesn't mean you're not wrong. We've been here 12 hours. I don't want to do it. I want to do the octave now. I don't want to go through this anymore. Take a breath. Let's focus and get this done. OK. We can't leave here... 25 to 30 octave, and I'm going to do a harmony on the "stare" part on line 30, and that's it. That's how we're going to play it. No. We're going to play it how I say we're going to play it, because you are paying me to make the call. And I understand that, but you're asking to do something I obviously can't do. I feel a record's done when everyone can't talk to anybody anymore, like when you hate each other, when there is just if you even see each other, you want to choke each other to death. That, to me, is a sign of like, OK. We're probably in a good spot. Remember when. Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh whoa Oh whoa When the tears are gone, it's time to cry. Don't you say a word. Just say goodbye to me. Goodbye means goodbye lasts forever. Yeah, goodbye to me means goodbye lasts forever. Goodbye to me means goodbye Lasts forever. All the feeling is gone again. Gone again. Untied memories will fall again. Fall again. The negatives were blown up. Now you finally must own up to... All the feeling is gone again. Gone again. It's gone again. Gone again. Gone again. Gone again. Gone again. Rewind the reel! Come here. Man, I'm so proud of you. Thanks. That was amazing. You've come so far. You never gave out. I'm just proud of you. Thanks. Well now that we do have a tangible product, I think the idea is just to get in front of as many people as possible. The key to getting people to play music with us is getting them to listen to the music. That's the reason why we went into the studio on our own was to be able to present that. I think the formation of the band is going to be dependent on that music. This whole thing that we've been trying to do with the culmination is to put together a band to do for us, a significant gig, and mark it off on the bucket list. We're trying to put a band together, and so we're basically going to go throw the shit against the wall, and this is a little sampler of what we did. This is you guys? We went and did this, man. This is all a sample of some of the music we've been doing. We want to give that to you, and my phone number's on there. And if you like what you hear and you're looking for a side project, give us a call. OK. Is that what this interview just turned into? You scrounge around for musicians? I think maybe you want to listen to the music first and say whether... Well, it's not so much the music. How much money... Do you pay? I think for the most part, people will like the music, because it does have a lot of the elements of the genre we grew up listening to. It definitely sounds throwback, like '80s, but it's very dark '80s too. It's like Bon Scott and Ronnie James Dio had a love child who wants to go out and set fire to school buildings. You get away with murder, and now I'm falling for your crime. Your Crime is my fave because it's a rocker, and it's You went hair metal, that was hair metal. You guys were able to capture that mid-'80s style metal sound without sounding dated. You could take that song, and fine tune it, and it would sound like a radio hit. I was really shocked. It was pretty fucking great. People aren't expecting a whole lot from us, man. And to have them be so surprised and go wow. He got a good performance out of you. I've never heard you sound that good vocally. Thanks, man. Gordon surprised me with his positive attitude, because I don't expect a positive attitude from Gordon. I mean, let's face it. I honestly thought that was you playing the lead. I was like well, he definitely got pretty damn good. It sounds like it needs a lot of work in the songwriting department to me. It sounds, for lack of a better term, generic. I know that not everybody is going to love what we do. I mean, music is really subjective. It reaches you, or it doesn't. If you would have gave us a different answer a while back of joining up with us, could you have seen yourself playing stuff like this? Uhhhhh. OK. So what do you want to work on, man? Talk to me. Let's just go through the songs. So Tony came back into the picture. Hey. This is Tony. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. We hugged it out first off, and I pulled him aside. And before I could utter a word he's like man, I'm sorry. I had just moved to Denver, and I just hadn't had my life sorted out yet. And it's a year later, and now I do. Yeah, let's rock. OK. I have no doubt that he's going to follow through on this. He's excited. I'm telling you right now. I texted Tony this morning to give him directions to the rehearsal studio, and oh, I can't make it. The cancellation thing... It can't happen anymore. So once again, Tony didn't work out, which really sucks. Get caught up later though, huh? Yeah. This thing is fucking falling apart before it's even started, and I don't get it. Through all the twists and turns that we've gone through and the ups and downs, it's a huge crossroads right now of what's next. We know what we want to be next. We got to bring all the pieces together, and we've got to do a gig. Getting that to happen has proven harder than it sounds. Eric, Kyle Kruger calling. Who is this? I just wanted to check in with you, see if there was any news. At the tone, please record your message. The guy said he was going to call me Friday. He's never even responded to me. It's a done deal. They want it to happen. We'll make this happen. I'm going to make this happen. You can count us in, man. We're going to have a gig. It's going to happen. We don't have a gig. Damn it. If you're passionate about it, you'll always find a way to make it work. Money doesn't matter. Hardships don't matter. It's all about the journey. If you've called me up and said hi, we've never played before, but we're really good, and here's our CD, I'll say great. Let me know when you've been playing around for a couple years. Give me a call again some other time, because you're not going to be able to create a draw if you haven't played. Chances of you guys getting to play Dallas, and Portland, and Denver, and Minneapolis, and New York, and New Jersey, cards are massively stacked against you that you're not going to get to do that. Chances of you guys getting to go on tour in a tour bus? Not going to happen. Three guys at a Shoney's on a Tuesday night acoustic wouldn't be your dream gig. You want to go play in Europe? It's not going to happen. So you're going to let us be your opening act then? Probably not. No. No. I get asked all the time, can we open for you guys? I don't know them. Have to go research the sound, look at the band. I haven't got time for that. Yeah. So that's a no then? We're damned if we do, and we're damned if we don't. We don't have a band without a gig. We don't have a gig without a band. What do we do to get ourselves prepared for when this happens? Because I'm not looking at it if it doesn't scenario. I'm looking at the when it does. Let's talk about what do you want to do and what we can provide. It was the phone call we've been waiting for. Do you know what I'm saying... forever. I'd love to have you. I love what you're doing. I think that's awesome. And it takes so much courage... not just the idea, but everything else you'd have to do with that. So is this going to happen? I think so, yeah. Oh, shit. I guess I better practice. It has been three weeks since the conversation first took place, and we've heard nothing back. We still have not received a confirmation, and we still have not received a confirmation. Nothing, not a word. We haven't heard anything from anybody. Since I have not heard no, and I'm still e-mailing. It's been five weeks since we've had any contact. We haven't heard back from anybody. It ain't happening. So I'm holding out hope that we're somehow going to end up on that boat, and that we're going to do that gig. I've got to start working on a Plan B, just in case. What do you think the viability of booking a serious gig? Maybe an undercard. You see that? Sure. Yep. I see no reason why not. So we have a show with no band yet. He's like, look. He goes you can bring in people, I'll make you guys direct support, meaning he'll put us on right before Jake. Its opening for Jake E. Lee. Oh, we're in. It's our gig, man. So we're recruiting a band. We're getting guys together. We're working on filling out that lineup. Got a guy by the name of Scott Parker who has been pretty diligent about wanting to be attached somehow. He's a bass player. So he went out and found this guy, Rich Carlson who is purported to be one of the best drummers in the state of Colorado. But the name of the band... Is there a name for a band? So we landed on a band name. It's called Bullet In The Chamber. Bullet In The Chamber. That sounds like a Pantera heavy band. Yeah. So yeah. Bullet In The Chamber is going to open for Jake E. Lee's Red Dragon Cartel here in Denver. If there's an upside to doing this gig locally now, Steve and I are at least going to be able to rehearse and get our act together. Off to band practice. That's a phrase I haven't uttered in over 25 years. So all four of us are getting together to see how it goes. And then if everybody's comfortable with each other, then we're going to move forward, and these guys will be part of the lineup that we field for this gig with Jake E. Lee. All right, man. I don't think we took that long though. We can't go outside for a guitar player. We've got to find somebody who's here. And then we found Stu. Killer local guitar player. Has a great reputation around town. So now we have the band together. We've just got to learn the songs. 2, 3, 4. 2, 3, 4. Our challenge now is that now that we're getting ready to play, we have a limited window in which to execute this. Since we're going to start again, let's identify parts with it, all right? And it goes eight times. It stays on the A. You guys are going to all go to 3/4? Yeah. Trying to hang in there, man. I'm hoping it's going to go OK. I think with just a couple more rehearsals, we should be ready to go. Think we're going to pull it off? We're going to have to, right? Well, after not playing for 25 years, let me see. What are you going to be in for? You have to really dig down deep, and you have to really get it together, or else you're going to come out on stage, and you're going to suck. And then that's going to be the worst thing ever. It's going to be complete insanity. Nothing but insanity. That's what they have to do, right? Yeah. Wait a minute. You've got to tap your foot when you play. Sure. And bob your head just a little bit. Yeah. Feel the groove. Yeah, because you want everybody in the audience tapping their foot. Oh, I'm giving them advice? Yes, advice. The whole thing's advice for them. It has nothing to do with us. It has nothing to do with us. See, I didn't know that. My expectations for this gig, the biggest stage possible, in front of the biggest audience, with the biggest PA, and the biggest lights that we can muster. Check, check. 1, 2, 3, check. Is it time for lunch yet? What time does catering get here? Does the food come? Is it pizza? Or what did we get, sandwiches? Well, I think we want to play in front of some people, first and foremost. We don't want to be at the dive bar down the street. That's not what this is about. We're going to do great. It's going to be awesome. All right. Some things only happen once in life. First things, last things, and these things. So please, give me a warm Denver welcome Bullet In The Chamber! So you think I'm not afraid. You think I've got it made. And all the things you hate mean everything to me. Try to live inside your world but then nobody told me about the feeling was so strange. So strange. As the light, it fades away, and the night won't turn to day, I hold my head down in my hands. Why can't I see? I don't understand. You didn't know how far to go You tell me nothing's wrong. Just leave you alone. Leave you alone! Then you you cry me a river while you hold my head down under. When the light fades away, and the night won't turn to day, I hold my head down in my hands. Why can't I see? I don't understand. As our time, it wastes away, and there's nothing left to say. I hold my head down in the sand. Why can't I breathe? I don't understand. Tell you nothing's wrong. Just leave me alone. Two guys living their dream. You and Steve doing your thing, and even if it was just for little glimmer in the spotlight, it was still you guys doing it, and that's pretty bad ass. Monsters of Rock Cruise, how are you doing? Woo! My name is Kyle Kruger, and this is my buddy, Steve McClure, and we're making a film called Hair I Go Again. And basically, it's a documentary about us hitting that mid-life crisis and deciding, you know what, man? Let's go play some music instead of working regular jobs and see if we can pull it off. So here we are. All the feeling is gone again. Just don't suck, man. Yep. Oh well god, that's the key. Bullet In The Chamber on three. All right, man. 1, 2, 3. Bullet In The Chamber! Gone Again Rewind the reel! Thanks, guys. If you can take two people and put them as far apart on the polar spectrum as you can get them, that would be you and Kyle. What's it like to finally get to this point with your old buddy, McClure, who you guys have been through hell and back with? Love him like a brother, but ready for a long vacation. Since we're in New Orleans, I bought a voodoo doll in hopes that I can get it to keep Kyle quiet for five minutes. So there have been times when I'm just like, I don't understand how these two can possibly have been friends this long. I'm going to have to cut off the sleeves though on the shirt to make it like Kyle. Stare, all I do is stare. Can't you see the fire in my eyes? Everynight I see your fate so scarred and in decay. Breathing your last breath when smoke gets in the way. Can't escape from my eyes, no you cant hide. Everywhere you turn I'll be there. Tell me now who's loathing most and all I'll do... All I'll do is stare! Eyes on fire. Broken windows to a soul. Suffer the burns of a lie again. Eyes on fire. Ashes fall but who's to blame? We both conspired, when we should have healed, But all we did was harm. And everywhere I turn, there's something in the air. I can't explain. I need the heat to feed the pain. It goes on and on and on. Eyes on fire. Stained glass windows save us all. I suffered the burns of a lie, again and again and again. Eyes on fire. Ashes fall lit up in flames. I tripped the wire, couldn't stand the pain. And now I lay disarmed. Eyes on fire. Stare, all I do is stare. Yeah. Can't you see the fire? Can't you see the fire? Can't you see the fire? Can't you see the fire? Can't you see the fire in my eyes? Can't you see the fire in my eyes? Can't you see the fire? Can't you see the fire? All right ready? We are ready. Ahhhhh! Shit.
