- Hey. - Howdy. - How's the trip? - Long. There you go. So you guys liked the sample, huh? Ah, he thinks it's good. You got any more? Well, you can wait a couple of weeks. I'm just about to bring in my dab. I have to check in with Mike. What are we talking, 20, 30 pounds? More like 50, I'm hoping. I might be able to stick around, make the rounds. Well, I'll let you know when it's ready then. Sounds good. - Eight. - Yeah, perfect. - There you go. - Thank you. Case, I got you at 49 hours, - 980. - Mm-hm. Yup. - Just took them out, right? - Eyes on. Okay. Thanks Dev. - Mara. - Hmm. - 52 hours, 1040. - All you got to do is go to Waikiki beach. No, No sir, have your beads on, have our surfboard and any tourist want to give money to people who look like me. Amen. They think you- - They will pay you to take a picture with you. I will gladly do so. That's what they pay you the money for. But you do surf, right? I mean, you know, I can get on one. Ah man, you go to Kuwait their shit is pristine. I know it is beautiful. They shot "Jurassic Park" there. Come on. What? Give him a break, it's the last film he ever saw. What? Nothing, going back to "Jurassic Park". It's a good fucking movie, it's a good fucking movie. How's college going? All right. That's it, that's all we get? What are you studying anyway? I don't even know. You just make up your own, you make your own program when you're there, so it's my own thing. You know what you should do, Mara? What should I do, Josh, tell me? You should write a book. Mm-hmm. I mean, you're, you're so smart. Thank you, Josh. You're way smarter than me. Oh, that's a fact. And I think, I think, if you write a book about Humboldt- - Ooh, I'll read that. I mean, I got some stories. I know you do, you've seen some shit. I would love to see my name in a book. And you do too, Saturday night was a fucking story, Jesus. And then, once the thing sells, you know, the TV rights, and that thing might blow the fuck up. Oh my God. Because that's so what I'm in this for. Look, I'm just saying, I care about you guys, I just want to see us all happy and fruitful and successful. So, if she wrote a book- - And we all got in on it, okay- - We all got it on my book - that I'm writing- - No, I'm just saying- I was, uh, I was talking to Kenny, he's got this package he's putting together to take East. Mm-hm. And, uh, Dev, you would not, you would not believe the prices he was telling me about. And we're talking like some really, like '90s shit. And while we're hanging out I was like, "Hey, you got to try Dev's new strain." Oh yeah? Yeah. So, he tries it. - Yeah? - He fucking loved it. He thought it was fucking amazing. He loved it so much, he was crazy about it. In fact, Dev, he was so talking crazy about it, he said, "I gotta take this shit with me." He said, "I have to include it as part of that East Coast package." Josh. Dev. I've got my own system. Dev, I'm just saying, it would not kill you just to modernize just a little bit. Look, I don't even know where you are with the, the guy in Nebraska, if you're still working with him or not, but you got to really be honest. You got to think about what are you going to do, you know, what are you going to do when they legalize there, because once they legalize there we're stuck, we're fucked. They're not going to legalize in the fucking Nebraska. Of course they're going to fucking legalize it in fucking Nebraska, they're legalizing everybody else. Like, why wouldn't they do it there? I'm telling you, Dev, if we put our heads together and we could try to find some like new modes of like distribution, maybe like some new products. I mean, and plus, you'd have me, you know. We could work together, we could be partners. Eventually, I mean, we don't do that right away. But, you know, after we get into a rhythm, that's what we do. Hmm, and you know what else we do? What? We focus on bringing in the harvest. Not eventually, now. Okay? Okay. 10,000 a day for cultivation, another 10,000 for non permitted structures. They really went after you. I assume you never applied for a permit? No. You think the county was going to let this go on without getting their cut? But, this is crazy though, they know I can't pay this kind of fine. It's a scare tactic, but you can't just ignore it. If the fines accumulate the county could put a lien on your property. In a few months, you could end up owing more than what the land is worth. Okay, they want me to get a permit, get me a permit. Right, okay, but going legal, especially this late in the game, it's tremendously expensive. We're talking 10s of thousands of dollars here, and there's no guarantee that the permit will even go through. So, it's a huge risk, right, and I don't want to be in the business of asking folks to put their property or their retirement on the line to fight this thing, because I can't guarantee that they're going to win. So, what are you suggesting, that I just give it all up? Well, as your legal adviser, I need to tell you, that's the safest thing to do at this point, but of course it's up to you. I don't think some of these guns are quite ready yet, I think we could use just a few more days. Hmm, I want them out today. I know, but they color's just not quite there. Today, okay? It was just my mom's voice in my head, and there's a little bit me too. Like, lately I've just been wondering if it's, any of this was even sustainable. Well, living your mother's life is certainly not sustainable, I can tell you that much. Yeah. Maybe it's more a purpose thing then, I don't know. I think you're doing great, come on, you're working hard, the universe is looking out for you, it's gonna help you find your right path, and you'll be up, out, gone, don't think too much. I don't know if it's the right path though. Oh, no. Mom keeps talking about, "There's a program at the tribal college, you could transfer." You've always got choices. Yeah, just, how do you make the right ones? How old were you guys then? Early years, early years. Be honest with me. This was 1970, what, '75. Pass that, Mara. The thing was, we had our commune and there were these guys down the hill, pacifists, and, uh, they didn't believe in defending themselves, they were pacifist, you know. God, I hate pacifists. So, yeah, they asked us, because I knew we had a few shotguns, they asked us to go out and sit on their porch and protect them from the rednecks. So, we said, "All right." So, we're sitting out there on the porch freezing our asses off. Anyway, at some point, uh, Devi turns to me, she says, "Ray, do you hear that?" And sure enough I do, it's coming from the house. Yeah, these strange noises. We go and peak in, and guess what? They were having an orgy. A true to God orgy! And so what did you two do, Ray? Well, we said, "Fuck you, you're on your own." And we went home. Mm-hmm. Not at all true, of course, what we did is we put the guns down and we went inside and introduced ourselves, and just joined right in. Ah, we did. Yeah, yeah. Right. You know what though, they did not make it, sadly. The trust fund dried up and they were gone, they didn't even make a year. Yeah, they had one good night though. God damn fucking bureaucrats. Oh, don't, don't let them get you down. It's just a pile of paper. Yeah. Don't let them intimidate you. You got to put your hands up, baby, it's windy. There you go. Yeah. Did you file for your permit yet? I'm not doing that, Devi. What? Pulled all my plans out yesterday. No, Ray. It's done, I'm done. Ooh, this your new strain? Oh, I think it's one of your best. Have you got a name for it yet? I'm working on it. Oh? What would you say? Well, Cosmic Trees. Oh, nice, I like that. I want to go like planetary or, uh, Saturn Moon, Rebel Moon. Rebel Moon. No. Just take it. Actually, okay, as you take this toke, you are smoking God's pussy. You know she has one, come on! Oh. Well, Devi, Devi? Hmm? You got to share God's pussy with the world. Amen, I intend to. Ooh, how about some more brother Ray? Ah. Ah. Oh, my God. How did we get here? Hmm. 10,000. Hold your horses. Yeah, we have harvests coming in all the time. This is a lot of work. It's all automated, Dev. Yeah, still. Yeah, I'm really happy with this trident this year, isn't it beautiful? You got a little yellowing, but yeah, very nice. Great. Hey, Dev, I, uh, heard about the letter. Hmm. I saw it in the paper. You okay? Yeah, yeah. Hey, you want to follow me, I got it ready to pack. What? Mike says we can't work with you anymore, Devi. Okay, what? What... Why? Your name's in the newspaper, Dev. Oh. Come on. Just bullshit, it doesn't mean anything. Well, Mike's a little bit paranoid, so- - I, I, one last deal. Sorry, Dev. You can't talk to him for me? Mike says you're done, there ain't nothing I can do. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Can you do it? - Yeah. Yeah, you almost had it. - Hey. - Hey, hey. Okay, so we're gonna start with little pep talk. What a great job you've all done, you've come a long way for a season never would know. The rookie thing is gone. And I appreciate it, okay. We got some kick ass weed, I think, to take the market. And some years you have good crop and bad business, and that's what we're facing here. We've got all this government crack down shit and, uh, all these permits and applications and it's, like, bleeding me dry. So, what does it mean for us? Well, I have a proposal for a different pay structure. Right now we get paid at the end of every week, and I'm proposing that we would take a lump sum at the end of the season. And if you agree to this, then there'll be significant bonus attached. And what if we don't? Then I don't know how were going to make it. I've been doing this a long time, I've never left anybody in the lurch on money. I know. But if you cannot then I will pay you off through today, and I'll have to find somebody else to take your place. So, did I lose everybody? No, they're not leaving. I talked to them. God, it's beautiful. Hmm. This you've built here. Yeah. It's fucking beautiful. You know what? Well, I'm going to get another one, you want one? I'm good. Do some damage. Don't worry Dev, we got this. Oh. Oops! - You are so- - It wasn't me, I swear. You're cut off dude. Come on. You are really fucked up. What? I think I hurt my back. Great. Shit! Hmm, it's good. Dev, I want to help you. I'm sorry, I'm just trying to help. I'm going to be sick. Don't tell anybody about this. I think I need to lay down. Yeah. I'm going to lay down just a minute. Yeah. Okay, Josh, I got you a hot water bottle here. When you go back to your trailer, you just get it into bed with you when you go to sleep. Oh boy. Josh. Josh? Hmm. Wake up. Hmm. Wake up. Come on. Hmm. Come on, get up. Can I just stay here? No. Hmm. Come on buddy, come on. Get up. I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up. - Oh. - I'm up. - Up. - I'm up. Come on. There you go. Okay. Here, I got you a hot water bottle. Fuck. I know, I know. Forward, just come on. Ah, geez. Come on. Here. Take care of your back, you put it against your back in bed, okay. Hey, hey. Are you okay? You need some help? No, I got it. So, do we need to talk? I don't think so, why? Dammit. What's up? No, no. So that's it? Okay, we good then? Yeah, we're good. Hey, Buddha. Hey, Dev, how are you? I am good, how the heck are you? Good. It's been a while. Uh, yeah. You grew that beard back. Yeah, yeah. You know, just got tired of shaving. That girlfriend must be gone now, right? Yeah, thanks for reminding me of that. I'm sorry, I didn't, I didn't, I did not mean to. I did just remember it as a funny story. - Yeah, yeah. - So, how are the folks? Uh-huh, they're great. - Yeah? - Yeah, they're really good. Are they home? No, you know, they're, uh, they're off traveling, you know. No, I did not know. Yeah, they're, uh, they're in Australia right now. Oh my God, how cool. Yeah, yeah, I finally talked them into it, you know, enjoy the fruits of your, uh, labors. Yeah. You know, let me take, take it off your hands. That's great that they trusted you. You were ready, you know? Uh, yeah. It's a big job, look what you've done here. Oh, yeah, no, there's a lot of changes. This is crazy, I mean, I would not have recognized the place. Everything is all like, right. Well, it's been a while since, uh, it's been a while since you've been up here. It is, yeah. But, you know, yeah. Give me a tour? Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. We moved that pond, like I said, it was over there if you remember. Yeah, what did that set you back? Uh, well, it wasn't pretty, but, um- - Yeah I know. We had to, in the end it, you know, in the end it made sense. Yeah, it does, it, it does. And now it's a real working venture. - Sure. - You know. So nice seeing the place looks so good. Thanks Dev. Yeah, a lot of work. Yeah, I'm sure you did. I'll say it's, uh, paying off. Well, when you finally hear from your parents tell them I said, "Hi." Of course, I will, I will. Yeah, I'm sorry you missed them. Yeah, I'm not a good communicator lately, my... So listen, do you ever get any calls from any of the guys back East looking for product? The reason I'm asking is, I'm having a little trouble moving mine and it is a really special strain this year. And I wondered if you might know anybody you could hook me up with. Uh- - I could give you a really good price. Uh, well, uh... Well, Devi... Look, I have to be honest, um, I mean even if I could help you, I can't. I really can't, there's, I mean, I gotta prove all my product is coming from legal source. Um, but if I could... Look, I just, I mean, some of us are working really hard and putting up a lot of money to make this transition, and it's kind of unfair if, uh, some other people aren't following that same rules, you know. Yeah, I wasn't asking you to move my product. I was asking if you knew anyone who could move my product. No, come on, I'm not trying to- - No, no, no- - Be an asshole about it, I just- - It's all good. Well, if I hear of anything I'll let you know. It'll be all gone by then. Uh. Well, it's good to see you. You too. Okay, what's up? So, you know how we were talking about - school the other day? - Yeah. I was just looking stuff up online and I need to register for classes really soon. Cool, you should do that. I also have to pay tuition when I do that. Oh. I have it all lined out, it's just taking a little longer than usual, okay? Okay, okay. So fucked up. Oh man, we can. - Hey. - Hey. So, is Canyon gonna come out and help you with all this? My son-in-law is flying in next week and, uh, we'll rent a truck and drive together cross country, with the rest of my stuff. That'll be that. Anyway, I appreciate you doing this with me. I really want to see the old commune one last time. A bunch of abandoned buildings full of rat shit. Yeah, well, you know what though? I was never as happy as I was when we lived there, honest to God. Those first few years, all of us together, in that big house. Oh, God. Oh, my God. We promise to live in community, to protect the land, to be open to ourselves and each other. Oh, my God. The rules. We were just kids, babies. What a view, huh? Well, it's going to be right here, and so am I. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you, too. Do not. Can I kill it? Got a little splash. You got to put it in the fridge. Yes, you got it. Fantastic. This is just the good stuff I was telling you about. Still got that salsa too? We're sorry, the propane was out at the trailers. We're going to cook if you want to join us? It's chicken. She's not going to, let us eat, right? No. That's exactly what she's doing. She's a little gnome in that fucking room and she's hiding in a little corner. She's drinking herself to sleep saying, "Oh, I'm so alone. Oh, I'm so alone." It's a fucking joke! It's a fucking joke! Got the moves, you got the moves, you got the moves. All right. We got to be there after nine, right? I've got a really incredible strain this year. It's the year I'm going legal, so timing is wonderful. If you have a good distributor that you know, I'm in the market, thanks. Hi, I'm Devi. 32 years in the business, I'm going legal. Looking for a good distributor, move my strains. They're pretty special, we even up in Humboldt. Here's how to contact me. - Hey. - Hey, good to see you. - Nice. - Had to do it. Um, because I'm seeing a lot of clients who are saying, you know, "I have this registration, I have this trademark. Clearly my brand, because I have a farm, is worth $100 million." Right. And they're, that's inaccurate. So, so, I think there's something really interesting that could be happening in the cooperative model, right now. Right, um, yeah, I think this is going to be one of the biggest grassroots industries in the recent history of the United States. Yeah, just look at the growth of, 500- Hey, what's funny? What? We're just chilling. Seems like something is really funny going on here? Let me see your phone! - Give me your phone! - Yo, yo. - Give me your phone! - Hey, hey! Calm the fuck down. What so funny? What do you mean what's funny? You were laughing, what are you laughing at? I'm fucking laughing at this fucking asshole. Been having a lot of good laughs at me. What are you talking about? Okay, you know what? I got one for you, you're fired. What? You're fired. What the fuck did I do? You know very well what you did. I, no, I don't Dev. - And you know what? - It's a little- - You're fired too. - Dev. This, this, this is so fucked right now. Dev, this is fucked. You need to pack up and I want you out of here tonight. We didn't do anything, you're the one who's fucking holding out on us. 30 years I've been in the business and I've never ripped anybody off, okay, and while I'm out in there trying to figure the fuck out so I can pay you little shits, you are fucking pranking me! And, and you are, and you are- - You're pranking me! And you are lying to us! You lied to us, and all we did was call you out on it. I want you out of here. Dev, will you calm the fuck down? No! It's a fucking joke, come on. - Get out! - It was a fucking- - Get out. Dev, calm down and just go back to- - Get out! Get out! Fuck. Who needs a fucking drink? Whoo! Hey, is everything okay? Huh? Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Case, come on bud, have a drink with me. It's too far, Josh. What is too far? Ain't nothing too far. Why are you upset? Dude, do not listen to her. You understand me? We're fine, everything's fine. Let's say that she meant what she said, right, then it's a win-win for you and me. You're going to Kuwait my friend, right? Go to Kuwait and me, I'm going to go, I'm going to go out to fucking Seattle. I say, I say we make a toast to freedom. Here's to being a free man. Holy shit, Josh. Get out. Dev? Get out. Dev, you have a loaded gun pointed at me. What are you doing here? Devi, let's talk about this very calmly. You're very upset and I think we should talk, okay? I'm right here in front of you, and Casey, I mean, he has nothing to do- Okay! Fuck. Case, start the truck. I'm going to grab the keys, okay, Dev. Mara? No, Mara? Mara? Mara. Mara wait. - I'm going. - Mara, please wait. Would you take this? Just take it. I don't want it. It's worth a lot, Mara. No, it isn't.
