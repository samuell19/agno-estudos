When I was just a boy, my father whipped me for not having washed my hands he first tied my hands and legs to the balcony 100 lashes!! He left me there in the rain all day long, to think of what I had done. The day went by and my father came to untie me without saying a word. One week later I found out that one of his corporals, for a similar mistake had sentenced his life to hell together with that of 100 men my father had given me also the 50 whips meant for the corporal to make me understand that rules must be obeyed always... even the most stupid and apparently useless ones. And it seems that no one has taught you about this since you don't obey even the most important rules. Now you will learn that there is no remedy for such mistakes. I would have brought them tomorrow. You should have done it today. Not even 1000 lashes would be enough to make you understand the seriousness of your behaviour... Your superficiality in dealing with your duties is an insult to my patience. Please, for the love of God... I swear that tomorrow I'll have all the money I owe you. Why are you trying to piss me off? Show this bitch that God doesn't exist. For the love of God. Shit!!! Who are you'? What are you doing here? Did you follow me for this? Here's your fucking wallet... it was empty anyway! Who's there with you'? Fucking hell... If you don't tell your friend to come out, I'll kill you like a dog... I'm not kidding!! I'll kill you!!! Now I will ask you a question and if you can't answer me, it's OK, I'll ask the next person... Maybe the person who will come looking for you, and won't find anything, so you'd better tell me all you know about this man I've never seen him. Clock's ticking... 10... 9...8 10 years ago I had an accident in the factory, I've been stealing since then to make a living I'm Just a thief... I swear I've never seen him before!!! Liar! I swear. H... help!! He's behind you... Just my luck, I met the only criminal who doesn't know the most powerful man of this city!! He's behind you!! I don't know what you're talking about. Lets do this, I'll turn around now so you can see that nobody's there. I swear. Boss, you should come and see at this... The only thing I managed to get out of him is that his name is Sam he says he saw a ghost in the sewer pipe after that he shut up well then you'll go down and check it out. Chief? What is it? I'm in pipe 3... I'm standing in front of the body of a middle aged man there is such a stink down here, please let me get back up!!! OK then, listen carefully now I didn't send you down there to find out what I already knew... you'd better find something better then a corpse did you hear me? Got it, sir... Freeze!! Hands up!! Chief!! ...I've found him!!! He looks clean. I'll leave you two alone... don't hurt him too much, boss!! See these pictures? I don't even know how to look at them anymore. But I'm not afraid of you and I don't give a shit how many people you've killed... So you'd better start answering me bet these aren't your documents... so tell me your name... where you live, and why you look like this. I have no name, inspector, and I live behind this man's right shoulder. Don't piss me off!! Don't make fun of me. Tell me who you are. Destroy him!! Don't leave, stay with me!! Now I'm going to ask you a question. Do you know this man'? Tell me where he is. Answer me!!! Bla bla bla bla... well, is that your answer'? What are you thinking about? It will never end... will it'? Sometimes I wonder what should have to happen to us that could make us understand how strong we can be. Follow me, I want to show you something, it's a secret... Look, isn't it beautiful? When I was little I used to come here to hide. Once I spent almost an hour in here I was terribly scared... the tunnel seemed endless, nevertheless I stayed here in the dark watching my mom and dad who had been desperately looking for me. Do you want to come in with me? I love you... Swear you'll never leave me even if a wind strong enough to blow the world away started blowing. Ooh... you've broken the mirror!! When will I be able to see my wife again? When you will have fulfilled your duty, by killing your wife's assassins... Damned Denny, when I catch you, I'll brake you in a million pieces. Good! I like that... Watch out, I wouldn't want you to get hurt, I couldn't bear it... ah ah ah ah. If only I knew where to find him. If the earth was a maze, which way would you choose for me? I would tell you to continue on the one you've been walking on and not to look for others... Only hatred can lead you in this story..and if you can thrive on it, any road will take you to him... What shifty weather! Come! Let's go for a walk. Why are you hiding behind me? Adam, look at these people, look at their eyes clouded over by their conscience. Even if they feel my presence, none of them would admit having seen me I will help you find your wife's assassins... and until the day of truth you will speak my word. Yeah.. I know... If I were you, I'd ask myself: What did I do with my life? Spending all day under a bridge doing nothing!! I don't want to have anything to do with this I've saved a little money but I've had to take risks for it, do you know that? I told you, I want nothing to do with this. No one's ever given me anything for free, pal. This place is a jungle and you have to adapt. Eat or be eaten... Hey!!! Watch out!!! Mother Fucker!!! You bumped into me, you asshole!! Take it easy, man!!! Mike Carrera, you must follow us to the police station... You're under arrest for murder. Mike, I can't believe iii! It's been what? 5 or 6 years from our last meeting? Derek, this is Mike, the man I told you about... Mike... Come on Mike!!! Smile for me!!! How did you find me? I always find what I'm looking for... A few hours ago, two men were attacked on the outskirts of Heaven Valley... What's wrong with you? You start attacking passers-by only because they speak to you? What do you want from me? I told you Mike, you have a long criminal record..if we add this one!!! We have a problem, Carrera. Clarence was found dead yesterday morning. Fucking corrupted police... what do I have to do with it? You see Mike, it seems that the fucking corrupted police have come across some files about war crimes which occurred during your stay in the army. Serious things, Mike, very serious... I'm not talking about a broken arm. It would be a real pity if this file became public I want to get rid of that dossier forever but. I need your help, Mike. What kind of "help"? This man... we want to know his name, where does he live, and everything which might help us find him and kill him. I've never seen him before so I don't know what the fuck you want from me. I told you what I'm looking for: Information. Which obviously you'll have to dig out since you don't know him... And which clues can I rely on. The footage you're looking at was shot by the surveillance cameras about 46 hours ago.. Lately Clarence had been investigating a series of murders... all apparently without motive, but all featuring the same symbol left on the crime scene every time. Yesterday, after going in the interrogatory room, he killed Clarence and almost demolished the third sector. Are you telling me that an unarmed man, managed to free himself in order to kill your shitty friend destroy half of the police station and then simply vanish? How do you think he fucking managed that? I don't know ...have you got any ideas? I'm thinking I'm talking to Ben and Derek, the same guys who framed me 10 years ago and who are now enjoying blackmailing me because maybe they've got nothing better to do because you are two crazy fucked sadists..and don't realize that my patience's got a limit... You see Mike... it doesn't matter if you believe me or not... What matters is that the 3rd sector is at risk of collapsing and since there might be some clues under there we want you to get down there and check it out unless you want that file to end up in the hands of the military Court! Come on Mike, help me make my first good deed... Found anything? I found this... Any Suspects? Eh Eh... no only the confirmation of something I already knew. My job is finished here then. But I want to introduce you to a friend of mine. I'm not interested in your friends... That's a pity, you know... because I'm sure you would have been surprised... Guess where he is. He's in the obituary..He's the man you killed yesterday!!! And who has decided to turn you in... Don't you believe me, Mike? Nice ornament on your face, Mr Carrera..what is it? A tattoo? I've always loved symmetric shapes..but I could never afford them. I'm warning you, this game is starting to annoy me, I'd like to know who I'm talking to and to see your face. Denny Richards: Father of Ben and Derek Richards, and owner of this city... My father was in the army from '42. He built this police station in the year '57. But from what I hear, you've also been in the army, am I right? It was a long time ago... My military skills are now rusty Mr Richards, so you'd better find your labor somewhere else. What is this place? This is the place where I spend most of my time Mr. Carrera... You see, under this imposing body I'm seriously ill. I've been taking medicine since I was nine years old. The Neurocrill... You can't find this in store. It's made by Army industries. This medicine has a million collateral effects one of which is, in time, to modify the vascular system of the patient. That's why it is necessary for the patient to take the correct amount of sedative during the therapy... This is the place where I come to relax. Take a look... Mr Carrera. I can't believe it, this motherfucker's still alive!!! Neurocril... Mr Carrera..Neurocril. Sure, I had to mend him up a little, sewing here..lying up there... but as you can see, the motherfucker's still alive. He doesn't understand what we're saying... does he? Why? What are you worrying about? That he might turn you in? I already told your sons... I don't like to be blackmailed!!! This man will be the least of your worries, I can assure you... And what should I worry about? Of that woman in the picture... Someone is trying to avenge her and he will keep on killing until he's found me and my sons. (How do you know about it'). I know because I'm the one who set her on fire.. She had a small debt with me and she didn't pay me on time. And that's the reason you burn someone alive? And you chop someone up only because he speaks to you? That bastard would have shot me... I was attacked. And I defended myself... It's completely different, you crazy bastard!!! When I was a kid, I had a dog, name was Denny, I gave him my own name. One day he ended up in a cave following who knows what. That cave was linked to the military warehouse where my father stored the Neurocril. He stayed there three days, stuck in the pit he had dug himself, gnawing at the vials out of desperation. I stayed there, waiting for him, but what came out wasn't my dog at all. He ripped off my face and my father forced me to kill him with my own hands under the threat that if I didn't do it he would have let me bleed to death. As you can see Neurocril has cured me as well... now you know why I wear this mask. From that day on, my view on piety has radically changed... even towards my own sons. I was wondering if you've ever been a victim of somebody's opinion. As I told you, in the past, there were others who decided for me... My dog did it, my father did it, and even the doctors did it when they decided that the best solution to reactivate my circulation would be this one. I am sure that the man we're looking for, is hiding in that building where we burnt that woman. I'm counting on your help... and I hope in future I won't have to solve this problem on my own. What an ugly look! Mike is keeping a close watch on you... Derek. And if I could read his mind I'd say: "Are you doubting my professionalism." But my brother thinks like that because you look like a homeless man, Mike. He doesn't know that under those rags a fierce killer is hidden... Sure you're not as crazy as my dad... but I'm sure that with a little luck: You'll solve this case. Do you remember me, asshole? What's you fucking problem? See what you've done to me... look at my arm! This is gas!!! What do you want to do? I've never seen you before! You're confusing me with someone else. I'm going to kill you! Please, help me! He wants to kill me!!! What do you want? You're not thinking of running away, are you'? Like anyone forced to do something against his will. Here, take this... I'm blind, but maybe it can be useful to you in there. Wait, wait... I can be your friend! I know the man you're looking for. He's the one who sent me here. Thank you but I don't need your help. Because I already have a friend. Look. What happened Ben!! Shot!! Shot him!! Shot him!! Where's your brother? He fled by foo!..Your son is a coward!!! I know this already... he's a coward just like you.. But I want to know why he is not here with you right now. I've lost him! Are you telling me that my blind son preferred to flee by foot instead of coming back by car with you Ben?!!! Call everybody... we'll go get your brother back: Whether he's dead or alive. What are you doing? I was looking at you. Next time you decide to dream of your wife let me know, so I can follow you give my support..ah ah ah... You're so kind to worry about me... Soon there will be no distance between you and what you want! I've never asked your name. Oh... I don't have name I'll give you one then... Derek.. They're here!!! We will fight, Adam. Bastard!!! Now it's your tum Ben! Clarence says hello from Hell!! Why didn't you shoot him'? My rifle didn't work.. It worked fine.. Doesn't matter if you don't believe me... it's over for you anyway!! Why did you impale my son? Because you set my wife on fire. Your wife owed me money. Ooh... What a bad girl!!! An outstanding debt is like a betrayal and I always punish those who betray me. Always, without exceptions! Fucking bastard! Prepare to die.. You'll never be able to take that mask off again. There is no distance between you and your desire. There is no distance between you and your desire... The dog... You didn't have courage to kill him, right'? I only shot near him, but my father killed him you are wimp, Denny. That's why you could have never won against me... I hope you realize that.. Please, let me pray God, before I die! Your soul belongs to me, Denny Richards... There is no God in the place where I'm about to send you. Help me, Dad! Adam, it's time to keep your promise.
