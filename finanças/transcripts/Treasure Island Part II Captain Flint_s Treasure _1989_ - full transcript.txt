Finance is better done in daylight: bank is a safer place for your doubloon. We thought we were close to treasure, we'll just tie up a few loose ends. Who's left alive will get their measure of money left to us by Flint and friends. The "Treasure Island" Come and take a look, it's a pirate book The "Treasure Island" by Robert Lewis Stevenson The "Treasure Island" On every other page, fights in drunken rage Louis-d'ors and bullets sing their song. I hoped to end my days old and wealthy but, for a pirate, honor is a poor trait. A bullet in the back is quite unhealthy, a "black spot" makes a poor piece-o'eight. And all of that for money, money, money, The root of all that's evil, as they say! They come for me, I thank you for the pleasure, It's murder time, and I must run away. The "Treasure Island" Come and take a look, it's a pirate book. The "Treasure Island" by Robert Lewis Stevenson. The "Treasure Island" On every other page, fights in drunken rage Louis-d'ors and bullets sing their song. - Tell me, Barbecue: how long are we going to stand off and on like a bumboat? I've had enough of the captain! He's hazed me long enough! I want to live in his cabin and... - Hands... Your head has no price on it because it never had any brains. Do not rush things. - But Silver, I... - Quiet. I'm talking. After Squire and Doctor find the treasure and help us to load it on the ship... - What are we going to do with them? - I vote... to kill. - Land ho! - Come in, come in, Jim! Something you want to tell us? - There is mutiny on board. I just overheard a conversation. Apparently, Silver was one of the chief henchmen of Flint himself. He knows about the treasure, but doesn't know where it's buried. As soon as we dig it out, they'll cut us all. - Captain, we got tricked by John Silver! What a splendid fellow! - He would be even more splendid hanging from a tall mast. - Yes, captain, you were right. I admit being an ass and await your orders. - I am just as much of an ass as you are, sir, if the crew managed to outwit me. Me! Captain Smollett! Well, no good complaining about it. I have an idea, gentlemen! I suggest we don't show that we know about their plans. Let's wait and see. - Sir, they know everything! We're finished. - So, how many people on this ship can we trust? - There are seven of us, counting Jim! - Against nineteen! - I'll fight as two men! No, as four! As twelve! As... - Permission to leave, sir! Duty calls! Yes, sir! Turn around! March! - Hey, lads! Anyone of you seen this land before? - I have, sir. We got some fresh water here when I served as a cook on a freight ship. - What? Ah, yes! It seems it's best to drop the anchor on the South shore, behind that island? - Yes, yes, sir. It is called the Skeleton Island. One of the sailors on my ship knew all the landmarks. That mountain over there is called the Spy-Glass Mountain. The pirates had an outpost there. - Lads, you all worked hard! Anyone who wants is free to go on shore leave! - Hurrah for captain Smollett! And now, everyone to the island! - Hurrah for captain Smollett! - Listen, Hands. Stay on the ship with a few lads and keep a close eye on the captain. You'll answer for it with your own life. Got that? - I wonder what the pirates will do on the island. I've got to check it out. - Is that Jim? - We've got to catch him, lads! - He'll ruin everything! - Jim! Where are you? Look for him, lads! - Where the hell is that boy? - I'm sorry, but who are you? - My name is Ben Gunn. [ Ben Gunn ] Used to be a well-behaved child. Then started gambling and hanging out with pirates. Soft-tempered. Not married. - It's been three years since I talked to anyone. - Were you shipwrecked? - No, I was left here. Yes, left here as punishment. And what's your name, lad? - Jim. - And whose ship is that, Jim? Not Flint's? - No, Flint's dead. But there are a few of his old mates on the ship, which is a problem for us. - Anybody with only one leg? - Silver? - Yes, yes, yes. His name was Silver. - He's our cook and the head of the entire gang. - I can help you out. But only if... - I'm sorry? - I just want to know... If I can get at least a thousand pounds of that money, which is mine anyway. - Of course. Squire is the most generous person in the world. - And he'll take me home? - Of course, sir! And now, tell about yourself, sir! [ Ben Gunn's story ] Flint, me, and a few others sailed to this island to bury the treasure. "Turn around, scoundrels!" yelled Flint. Then we decided to kill Flint and take the treasure. but 3 years later I was back on the island. Lads! I know where Flint buried the treasure! We searched for twelve days, but found nothing. Every day they cursed me more and more. And so they left me on the island. - Oh, that's a horrible story, sir. And if we make it back to the ship, you'll get a head of cheese this large. But ssshhhh. I hear steps! It's the pirates, let's hide! - Things are looking bad. Jim has disappeared, and it looks like the pirates won't let us out of here. We have to do something. Ah-ha, here's Jim. Who's that with him? Here's Silver... and the pirates. And what's this? Gentlemen! I have an excellent plan! - One! Two! One! Two! One! Two! Keep against the tide! A cannon! They are arming a cannon! Why? Ah! They are going to shoot! Faster! One! Two! One! Two! Back water! - Smollett and Trelawney took the weapons and fled! They took the block house! - They can't see the block house from the ship. They are shooting the flag. We must lower it. - Lower the flag? Proud sailing traditions do not allow lowering the flag during a fight! Never! - Jim! Jim, take a look! See that? That's where your friends are. - Not the pirates? - No. Silver would have raised the Jolly Roger, the pirate's flag! - Then we should go join them! - Wait, wait! I must meet with the doctor. Tell him to come alone. - Very well. - Doctor, Squire, Captain! It's me, Jim. Hello. - Doctor, I just met a man. His name is Ben Gunn and he has some kind of news for you. - What's this? - A white flag. - I'm willing to bet it's some kind of a trick. Attention! Man your posts! One! Two! One! Two! - What do you want? - I want to make a deal. Do not shoot. - Very well. Sit down, my good fellow. - Thank you. - Now tell us why you are here. - We want to get the treasure. And we'll get it. And you want to save your lives. And you have a right to that. - Do you have the map? - Maybe! - I know that you do. Give us the map. - Is that all? That won't do, my good fellow. - Then it's time to let the guns talk. - You don't say? - You've run aground, Silver! And all because of your greed. And now, here's an inspiring story for you, sir! [ A song about greed ] There lived a greedy pirate Billy. Not a person liked him, really. Not the sailors, not the pirates, not the children, not his kin. Couldn't help himself, our Billy, love of money drove him silly! He was always treated chilly Any place he settled in. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! The moral of this story One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greed will make you sorry! One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! I already said it: One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greed's a nasty habit! Girls and women Billy hated: never married, never dated. Never once, with breath abated kissed a single pretty lass. For you see, he wasn't willing to dispense a single shilling. And just when he made a killing, he had a stroke and died, alas! One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! The moral of this story One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greed will make you sorry! One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Listen to me, will you. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Avarice will kill you! Bill is dead, and end of story. He thought money was his worry. Now he's looking sad and sorry, having lived his life in vain. Let me make this very clear: Greed can kill a buccaneer! Everybody, gather near and repeat the song's refrain. One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Moral of this story One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greed will make you sorry! One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! I already said it: One, two, three, four, five, six, eight! Greed's a nasty habit! - Did you get all that, Silver? If you turn yourselves in, I'll put you in chains and you'll be tried in court. And if not, then remember that you are dealing with Captain Smollett! And I won't rest until you all hang. - In one hour those of you who are still alive will envy... ...the dead. - To your stations! - Dammit. It's been over an hour. It's getting a little dull. Ah! There they are! Attention, get ready! Fire! - Hand-to-hand combat! [ We have fresh rum! ] - Stick 'em up! - Not bad, not bad! They got their rations for today. Well, gentlemen, it used to be four against nineteen. Now it's four against nine, excellent! Gentlemen, I congratulate you on our victory! [ Musical Interlude ] While the pirates are caring for their wounds... and Jim, Trelawney, Livesey, and Smollett rest after a glorious victory... the band "Grotesque" will perform their new song... "We're all a part of this regatta" We're all a part of this Regatta We row toward the finish line In hopes to be persona grata With gold and ladies, and good wine. Some may earn more, it's not surprising, but it's a thought that eats our mind. And every day demand keeps rising while the production falls behind. So air your oars, my friends, to hell with all these riches. Our lives are short, why eat until you choke! There's more to life than simply stuffing britches. So air your oars, my friends, so air your oars, my friends! There's more to life than simply stuffing britches. So air your oars, my friends, so air your oars, my friends! You try your best to stuff your pockets But time will come, when Mr. Grim will yank your oars out of their sockets and kindly ask you to proceed with him. Let's keep it simple, this path before us let no one curse our names, my friend! Let's try it out, let's air our oars! Let's air your oars! Stop!.. The end! So air your oars, my friends, to hell with all these riches. Our lives are short, why eat until you choke? There's more to life than simply stuffing britches. So air your oars, my friends, so air your oars, my friends! There's more to life than simply stuffing britches. So air your oars, my friends, so air your oars, my friends! - So that was you, Ben Gunn, who dug out the treasure? Splendid! And you took it all to this cave? Brilliant! Now the pirates are in our hands. I can now turn the map and the block house over to them. Marvellous! [ Back soon. Livesey. ] - What the devil's going on? What's Dr. Livesey up to? He must have some sort of plan. Well, if he has a plan, then I better come up with something, too. I'll steal Hispaniola from the pirates! - You are a scoundrel, Israel Hands! - Who, me? - Yes, you! - By thunder, that's Jim! - Who's there? It's Jim Hawkins! I'll be damned! Come in, come in! Always glad to see... an old friend. Since you're here, why don't you join us? - But sir, how did you get here? Where's Dr. Livesey, Trelawney and the captain? - We had a deal: we get the block house, and they get to leave. Where they are now, I do not know. - Sir, since I'm your prisoner, I'm at your mercy. But you should know this: it was me who took the chart from Billy Bones. It was me who eavesdropped on you and told the captain about your plans. It was me who killed Israel Hands and stole the schooner. You have lost! - Make him bleed! - Get back. What makes you think you can order around here, John? You think you're the captain? - Johnny's right! Make him bleed! - Any one of us can command here. - Gentlemen... Anyone who wants to deal with me can step outside. Take a cutlass, him that dares. And I'll see the colour of his inside, crutch and all... ...before that pipe's empty. Not too brave now? Then hear this. Anyone who touches Jim will have to deal with me. You lot want to say something? Then say it. I'm listening. - Your pardon, sir, you're pretty free with some of the rules lately. The crew has a right to gather and council! - According to the rules! - Forecastle council! - That's the rules! - You're within half a plank of death, Jim. They're going to throw me off. Tit for tat. I'll save your life, and you'll save Long John from swinging. - What I can do, that I'll do. - It's a bargain. - By the way... Do you know why the doctor gave me the chart? There's something under that, no doubt. - John, we're throwing you off! - The crew, in a council, according to the rules of the gentlemen o'fortune... ...decided to send you the black spot! - Turn it over, and read what it says. [ Deposed ] - You'll sing a different song now! - You're deposed, Silver! Get off that barrel! - Get off the barrel! - Kick him out! - Now listen to what I have to say. This boy is a hostage. And he, this boy, might be our last chance. - All right, what about the doctor? - Why did I let him and the others go? Here. - It's the real thing! - Here's Flint's signature. - Yes, with a knot in it! - But how are we to get away? - We have no ship! - You ought to tell me that. You and the rest, that lost me my schooner! I found you the treasure. But you, you lost me the ship. I don't care to be the captain of a bunch of idiots. I've had enough. - Silver! - Barbecue forever! - Gentlemen. Let's go look for treasure. - What's the matter? - What's happening? - He already found! - Found the treasure! - A skeleton! - He was a seaman. He's dressed in good sea-cloth. - Oh really? Who did you expect to find here? A bishop? However... why are the bones laid out so strangely? Oh, I think I get it. They are pointing to where the treasure is. Just take a bearing, will you. - South-West. - That means the Pole Star is there. - And there are the jolly dollars! - By thunder, it's one of Flint's little jokes. - These are the three tall trees. It's child's play to find the stuff now. - Mates! Great riches wait for us over there! Come on! - Is that Jim? - Who else! - Gentlemen! We must save Jim. It's our duty! - Attention! Hear my orders: surround the pirates! - Hey, where's the money! - Where are the doubloons? - Where are the dollars? - Gone! - Sir... there's nothing here. Someone got here before us. Where's the treasure, sir? - Is this your promised seven hundred thousand? Gentlemen! There's only two of them! One a cripple who brought us here to our deaths... the other's that cub that I mean to have the heart of. - Look, look! - What is that? - They are coming this way! - Run for your lives! - Hello, gentlemen! Hello my dears! You don't look so good! Allow me to listen in... That's wonderful! Breathe deeper. Splendid! A bit hoarse, is it? Stomach droopy, liver completely shot, that's good. Excellent, excellent! Teeth now, let's see. Rotten, jolly good! Many missing, that's marvellous! Lads! You smoke way too much! With lungs like yours, you couldn't run a hundred yards. Remember! Smoking is bad for your health. [ Song about the dangers of smoking ] Columbus sailed into the west with fellow seamen folk. Upon returning from his quest He taught the world to smoke. It started from a pipe of peace he shared with the chief. But with it came a great disease: addiction to the leaf. As warns the Surgeon General: Tobacco's not a game! As warns the Surgeon General, As warns the Surgeon General: And Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus... and Columbus is not the one to blame. Columbus, though a clever man, knew none of what he did. Who knew tobacco flames would fan from China to Madrid. To smelling roses we prefer the smell of putrid smoke. And with it cancer, my good sir, and chance of early stroke. As warns the Surgeon General: Tobacco's not a game! As warns the Surgeon General, As warns the Surgeon General: And Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus... ...is not the one to blame! And as to me, I'm glad I quit, now fit and strong like bull -- To Surgeon General I bid my gratitude in full. Let's make "tobacco" a "taboo" No if, or when, or but. If we could do it, you can too kick smoking in the butt! Tobacco's not a game! As warns the Surgeon General, As warns the Surgeon General: And Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus, and Columbus... ...and Columbus... ...is not the one to blame! - And what will happen to me? - It's up to the judge. But I will keep my promise. - So it was you, Ben. - It was you who dug out the treasure. - One, two! One, two! One, two! Stop, one, two! - Hear my orders! Load the cargo! - One, two! One, two! One, two! Prepare to set sail! One, two! Check the top sail! Check the gaff sail! Raise the sails! One, two! Full speed ahead! It appears that we have made it to the final scene! And nobody (what a pity!) cared to do me in. I'm not destined to be hanging cut up with a knife! I'm gentleman o'fortune! I'm gentleman o'fortune! In film and real life! In film and real life! - Just like real life? - Just like real life! Since the viewers like to watch the movies just like ours. Let us turn it up a notch and make it last for hours. (The fansubber wants to thank his most amazing wife!) I'm gentleman o'fortune! I'm gentleman o'fortune! In film and real life! In film and real life! - Just like real life? - Just like real life! - Damy and gospoda! - Ladies and gentlemen! - Mesdames et monsieurs! - Senores y senoritas! - Comrades!
