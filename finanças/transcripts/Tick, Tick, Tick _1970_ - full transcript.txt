Much obliged. [laughing] Phew. - What do you have? - Drink of water. [glass clinks] You might as well come out with it. You never come in my place. Thought you got here to pick me to scratch. You gotta back room here, Junior? - So? - It's gotta bed in it? Sometimes, I sleep. There's rumor going around. This particular rumor has you rented it out to teenagers. - It ain't so. - I'm betting it is. I'm also betting that ain't all it's used for. What are you talking about? Found a colored boy out on a highway all beat up last night. And somebody had painted a white K.K.K. on his forearm. You got no proof my back room was used for that. Not yet. How you boys today? - Okay, John. - Good, John. Heard your wife had another baby, Tolbert. - It makes ten, don't it? - Last time I counted. [Tolbert] 'Done run out of fingers to count on.' Asking Junior about that back room of his, John? No...I was telling him. Unless my calendar's a liar, this is your last day in office. You out on your keister. Tomorrow noon. How'd you feel having a nigger take your job? [John] 'He's voted into office. I was voted out.' [male #1] John, come around here. Just can't understand how you let that black boy walk in, take a job away from you. 'You've been raised around here and all.' Because it's the law, Rankin. You know as well as I do he didn't get a single white vote out of the whole county. According to the law, black and white don't make no difference. Votes a vote. That's the law. Now, I reckon it is.. ...who made that law, you suppose?

We're all out of work tomorrow. Warren, this is Sheriff Little. Where are you? Over. [radio static] I'm just sitting out here on number 10. Scratching, chewing. Not doin' much, nothing to speak of.

I don't have much money saved, Julia. Yesterday there was little in a wood pile. Today it was catch a little by the toe she hollers. Let her go. I think I maybe apply for the highway patrol. [both mumbling] Oh, God, I'm so tired. Moment you get outta Colusa County. Always so sorry about all this. So sorry. Well, I have to show him the files setup all at Monday. He wants you. Don't say nothing. Oh, Jesus, he's military police he'd probably knows more about files than I do. [vehicle skidding] [boy #1] 'Hey, Little, you've gonna let a nigger take your job, Little?' 'What's the matter, Little? You chicken. Ha, ha, ha.' 'Show me, chicken. Chicken Little. Chicken Little.' [imitating chicken clucking] 'Chicken Little. Chicken Little.' Before that last election nobody in this county would have dare do that to you. Nobody! What you expect me to do, Julia? Kill 'em? - How do you feel? - 'Like I'll be a good sheriff.' If they let you, you mean. 'If they let me, I'll be a good sheriff.' They don't, you be a dead one. [clock ticking] You mind if I go along with you today? - And hold my hand? - Jim. You haven't even got a deputy. Those organizers who helped get you elected. Man, they flew back north like-like big birds. 'You're all alone now and no deputy.' I have got a handful of applications. 'Then why haven't you hired one?' Because I'm not officially the Sheriff of Colusa County until noon. Come on, kids, let's go see if your dad's honor guard is ready. Well, I guess it's... about that time. [clock ticking continues] You gotta look at the bright side of things. Think about it. For the first time, people have a sheriff they can call, boy. Mama, mama, mama. Now don't you go worrying. See you later. I just can't believe it. Be careful, son. Okay, mother. Walk me outside. There's a big crowd. A dead hero makes a poor father. Look, even the dumbest white man has to know if he kills me a thousand will take my place. And out of that thousand there is not one that can take your place with me. I'm your woman, your children's mother. And you are my life. That's why I'm doing it. [people cheering] [cheering continues] Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Hi, pretty, you gonna be a good girl while daddy is gone? Bet you, big man, gonna take care of mommy? Come on. Thank you, Jonas Thank you, Reverend. Thank you. [people cheering] - 'Good luck, Jim.' - 'Good luck, Jimmy.' [indistinct chatter] You're a fool if you're not scared. I'm no fool. [chicken clucking] [people cheering] [car stereo] [song continues] [crowd greeting] 'Good morning, Mayor.' 'Morning, Mayor.' Morning! Hell it's noon. What's the matter with you? You got no work to do? Get out of my way. [clangs] I ain't liking seeing the glances all around Colusa County at this moment. 'He's due here at noon. Ain't he?' There's not really any need for you to be here, Mayor. - All I'm going to do-- - Don't tell me. As long as I'm here I know there won't be any incidents. What makes you think there would be if you weren't here, Mayor? This scratching, gum-chewing, backwater nothing you got for a deputy, that's what. First deputy this county ever had that I saw that oughta be locked up for loitering. I know his daddy and I know his daddy's daddy, just like him. Neither one of 'em was anything. Nothing. Mayor, you got no right talking about my kin that way. 'And your grand momma, old lady Sarah Springer' She's the worst of the lot. Know it for a fact, used to go with her. Terrible woman. Terrible. Maybe you are the Mayor this town-- No maybe to it, my boy. I am the Mayor. Anything happens to this colored boy we'll have the voice and peek-a-boos all over Colusa County by sundown.

[key clinks] I got a clue for you, boy. I'm-- Springer! I'm the number one citizen of this town, Price. And this town is a comic. I reckon you know some of the problems you're liable to run into. I was born in this town, Mayor. When you hit a wall, you think you can't climb over dig under or go through. You come to me. Don't go pickin' up that phone to call Washington or the "NAACP." You hit a snag, you come to me first. Might be I can get it unsnagged for you. - What if you can't, Mayor? - What was that? Suppose I have a problem and you can't help me solve it. All I may ask you to do is give me a chance to try. Is that askin' too much? You weren't askin', Mayor. You were telling. Well, hell I'm used to telling. I ain't used to asking. What are you men still hangin' around for? Go away, all of you. Scat. I wasn't voted out of office because I have been a bad sheriff. I was voted out because I ain't colored. Did I say somethin' funny? I've been meanin' to have a talk with you about your complexion. Oh, you.. [both laugh] [snorts] I am the first man in the whole state to get hit over the head with black power. 'You think that's funny.' Johnny, what is it? Tell me. You know, I am planning to show him around the office. I was goin' to explain the files to him. You know all that. When it come right down on it. And when we was face to face. I couldn't say a thing.

How long have you been here? About three hours. Oh, Fred's stayin' with the children. Why didn't you come inside? I didn't think it would look right. It's only your first day. I don't want you to do this again. [engine spluttering] - You been playin' the radio? - Uh-huh. [engine stalls] What is it? What's wrong? You stay here. I'll be right back.

[tires screeching] [wailing continues] [phone rings] [wailing continues] - Hello. - What the devil's goin' on? I don't know, Mayor. I'm not your sheriff anymore. Well, sounds like the Russians are coming. [wailing continues] - How old are you? - 28. - Finish high school? - Yeah. What happened in my town last night? Nothing that I know about, Mayor. Nothing? It sounded like a Chinese fire drill. Look, Mayor, yesterday was my first day on the job. And if you take a look under the hood of my car, you will find over $100 worth of damage. - You know who did it? - No, sir. - 'Any insurance to cover?' - 'No, sir.' Well, did you.. Well have it fixed and bill the city. I see, you didn't fill out the space stating why you wanted to be a deputy sheriff? They've been whipping our heads for years now. I figure it's our turn. - I can't use you, Harley. - How come? The job calls for maintaining law and order. Not whipping heads. You was raised in this town. And you know white's been down on us ever since we were kids. Now gonna tell me-- I'm telling you I can't use you. Oh, man. I mean I've been thinking you was a soul. First thing I hear I come in here. And you yessin' at that old white Mayor. Well, you ain't no soul. You ain't nothing. I am the Sheriff. Not the white sheriff, not the black sheriff. Not the soul sheriff. But the sheriff. - That's it. - No, man. That ain't it. And I am gonna tell you-- No, you're not gonna tell me nothing. Don't let your mouth get you in trouble, Harley. Now get outta' here. Wilkes. Have a seat, Brad. How did you like Vietnam? I ain't scared of hell no more. Special forces, eh? Medical specialist. It doesn't say uh, why you wanna be a deputy sheriff. I don't want to be a deputy. How is that? I want to get married. And that takes money. And at...the present time this seems to be the best job around. You know it could be the worst job around. Could be. It's yours. Afternoon. You got anything else for me to do? Drain pipe on the side of the house needs to be fixed. I did it. There is a loose bolt up here on the porch. Not anymore. Holes needs a new washing. Not anymore. Hinge on the kitchen cabinet is broken. Not anymore. Oh, Johnny, why don't you just go fishin'? Called the highway patrol headquarters at the capital. They.. Well, they're hiring men. In their twenties. All of 'em high-school graduates. Even some went to college. Do I look old to you? - Ain't you? - I'm serious. I know you are. That's why I am not. You're not going to seduce me into any suicide path. Make you feel so old. Old and sort of worthless. It's Warren. How you today, John? I'll make it. What's up? Bengy is over to pool hall. Still wearin' his gun. Why? He wants to be the first white man Price tries to arrest. Says he'll kill him. Why you comin' to me with this? It's still your county as far as I'm concerned, John. But I'm not the law anymore. If you ain't the law, then there ain't none. [kids singing] [kids sobbing] They don't mean nothin'. Then why do they do it? [male #3] 'Hey, boy.' You're the new law around here, ain't you? Thought you might want to know. There's a man over in the pool room wearing a gun. 'He says he'll kill you, you try to take it away from him.'

But I can tell you this, Sheriff. That boy lying on the floor in there is a crack shot. He comes from a long line of crack shots. I have to do my own job, Mr. Little. I don't want anybody to do it for me. I apologize for saving your life, Mr. Price. You're double parked. - Afternoon, Mr. Little. - Afternoon, Homer. - Is the Mayor in? - He's in his study. The Mayor, he is feeling kinda poorly today. He celebrated last night? [butler] 'That ain't for me to say.' [knock on door] Come in. What's the matter, Mayor? You come on with some bad eyes. That's not funny. You know that's not funny, don't you? Sit down. You did send for me, didn't you? Don't be impatient with me, Little. I'm an old man. I'm not gonna live past a 110. I'm certain of it. Excuse me, Mayor. But how long you want me to sit here? I don't care whether you sit or not. You could lie down if you want to. Homer, Homer! Get in here. Come here, come here quick. You see him under the branch? - You see him? - I see him. Quick. Get the gun. Squirrel getting all my pecans. Little gangster is out there every day. Haulin' away more than him and his family can eat. When he can't find them on the ground he shakes them off the limbs. I hear you busted Bengy Springer's head for him. I wasn't gonna stand and see him put a bullet through that badge I wore all those-- Then why didn't you make a citizen's arrest? At least we could've got him sent away to save pain for awhile. Bengy Springer is stupid. He thinks he's a little Dutch boy with his finger in the dyke. He ain't the only one. What are you doing? Patching the wormholes. So I can get a draw. Good cigars are too expensive. I buy seconds and thirds. How many holes does a cigar has to have for you to give up on it? Makes no difference. As long as I don't have to smoke it like a piccolo.

Over in Nam, I got to be pretty close with some of the white boys in my detachment. They needed me. And I needed them. 'One day, on patrol we got into a fire fight with Charlie.' It was a miracle that we got out of it alive. When we did, one of the white boys came up to me. Threw his arms around me and he hugged me tight. He was so happy. Man, you know, I've been there before, too. Wait a minute. When my tour was up and I was coming home. He came up to me and he made me give him my address. Said he wanted to keep in touch. 'Now, you know, he won't.' He admitted at that time, you know. But he won't. Do you wanna keep in touch with him? I think so. If it wasn't for that wall, man. I don't understand. What wall?

We better get you to a doctor. Come on, partner. [sighs] You going hunting or something, Jonas? Who beat up Brad Wilkes? If I knew that I'd had him in jail. Maybe we can find out. If you do that, Harley, will you lemme know? We'll tell you where to find the bodies. Look, Harley. I've got a job to do. So don't go messing around making it harder. What you want me to say? Yes, sir. Boss? We can start with that. Hell, Price. Why they beat up your own deputy? And you the sheriff. You know better and we have a word. [people bickering] Alright! Alright, man. I'm doing what I can. I'm doing it withinthe law. Now you men gave me this badge and I'm gonna use it. You understand that, Harley? If you go against me you gonna have a whole lot of trouble on your hands. Are you threatening me? Sheriff? No, I'm promising you. Now, you men get out of here. Come on. Just go on home. I'm surprised at you. Good Baptist like you. Don't worry, mama. He'll be alright. He can take care of himself. Mary, bring me a cup of coffee, will you? What happened Jimmy? Mary, Wilkes got stomped on last night. - K.K.K.? - I don't think so. K.K.K. wouldn't have gone to the trouble of busting in a store to ambush him. They would have jerked him up wherever they found him. It was you they were after. You were supposed to have that duty last night but Brad Wilkes took it for you. I bet...John Little could tell you who did it. I'm sure. But after I've asked him to mind his own business. How can I turn around and ask him for help? Oh, God! Do you think pride worth getting killed for? Don't you? You have any proofs Springer did it? No. I know he did. Oh-oh. That would impress a supreme court, Little. It really would. If he gets away with this, we can kiss law and order good-bye in Colusa County. I'll tell you something that concerns me more than that. What do you think Braddock over in Roper County is gonna do? When he hears our black Sheriff has his little white fucker all locked up. He don't know yet? If he knew, he'd have been here. Boy hasn't called him. He wanted to make sure that when he does his daddy would get real good and mad. Then Price is gonna need help. You didn't seem to think so when they handed him your badge. Hell, you didn't even show him where the bathroom was. [sighs] Alright, I was wrong. I know it. You want to go home and find Bengy Springer and lock him up. Because he helped beat up that deputy last night. The answer is no. You've got no authority. But Price is gonna need help and you won't let me help him. I didn't say that. I said you had no authority to help him. Well, what am I supposed to do? - That depends. - On what? On whether you mind being called a nigger lover. 'Hello, daddy.' 'This is Johnny.' 'Yes, I'm over here in Colusa.' Well, daddy, you ain't gonna believe this. But I'm in jail. Yes, I had a little accident out on the highway and uh, this new sheriff they got, he locked me up. Yes. Thatnew sheriff. Daddy, I wanted to call you the day he locked me up. But he wouldn't let me. Fine, daddy. Fine. Be seein' you. You hear? Why did you tell your father that lie? Oh, I don't know. Just seemed like the thing to do. Would you like to hit me or something? I've been raped. [country music] [music continues] Anybody seen George Harley? [male #5] 'You must be getting along with whitey pretty good, Jim.' You gonna start locking up your brothers? No man who rapes a 15-year-old virgin is a brother of mine. Well, look who's here. Oh, yes, sir. Boss himself. Got a warrant for your arrest, Harley. I dont care nothin' 'bout no paper. Look, Harley. Don't make it harder on yourself. Now look, Price, I'm working on my car. I got no time to go nowhere with you, man. I'm gonna take you in. Set your mind to that. You know, you gotta come through us to get to him. Big man. Well, I don't guess I can hear that. Ah! Ow! [both grunt] Ah! Oh.. Alright. Come on. Get over there. Get over there. I know you guys don't want to get locked up. Take it easy. Let's go. Where you think you're going? Where you taking my boy? He's good boy. He ain't done nothing. I told you he ain't done nothing. How come you gotta go messing around with good-decent-black folks anyhow, Mr. Muckitymup. Hm. Your heads are all small up called you to sheriff now, huh. You no-good-stomped down-hyper looting dog. You white folks, nigger. I'll get you for this. You pig. You pig, you. You better not come back here. I'll fix you. What I oughta do is put you two in the same cell and let you kill each other. Welcome to the Colusa County jail, sambo. Shut your mouth. You red neck, peckerwood. Oh, now what's the matter? You don't like us kindly white folk? You tell it like it is, honky! You keep saying you won't do it, but I know you are. No, I won't. No chance. My foot. It's been all over you like chalk on a black board. If you're gonna be that nigger's deputy, just assure us the sun's gonna shine in July. You don't know how silly you sound. 'I haven't lived with you all these years without learning something about you, John Little.' You make me aggravate, you know that, Julia? You think you know everything about me. 'I know you're gonna do that and I don't care' 'if my knowin' it makes you mad or not.' Everybody is gonna say John Little's got a nigger-boss. Ha, ha, ha. They're gonna say John Little is a nigger lover. But you're just gonna do it, anyway. 'Every white woman in Colusa County' 'is gonna look at me with big, pitying eyes.' 'But that won't stop you. The children are gonna get hurt' 'but that won't stop you either.' When you get it into your mind that law is law and right is right, you're so blind stubborn you don't stop to consider anything or anybody. This time, Miss Smarty-pants, you're dead wrong. He wanted to be sheriff. Let him work at it. Not gonna pick up his marbles for him.. Devil with him, I'm not goin' anywhere near him. You're as good as that man's deputy right now. - I tell you I'm not! - Ha! [whispers] I'm not. You've got my boy here. - I come for him. - What's your boy's name? Don't you give me that. You just get him out here. Is your son named John Braddock? You better believe it. Now get him out. I'm in a hurry. I'll release him to you. His bail is set at $25,000. - Twenty five thou-- - Mr. Braddock! You're son is charged with man-slaughter. Driving under the influence of alcohol. Resisting arrest. And leaving the scene of an accident. Man-slaughter? He was in an automobile accident. A little girl was killed. Some, uh, little-black girl, I imagine? Mr. Braddock, a little girl is a little girl. It so happens, she was a little, white girl. 'Six years old. Named Laurie.' Gimme the keys to my son's cell. - 'No way.' - Hey! Do you know who my brother is? Biggest man in Roper County they tell me. And, uh, that don't mean a thing to you, huh? Yes, sir, it does. It means you're away from home. Well, what're we standing here, talking to him for, Frank? Let's go in and take him. I hope you don't do that, Mr. Braddock. You do, I'll have to shoot you. And if he misses, I won't. 'So..' This is what it's come to in Colusa County, huh? Get out of my way! [engine revving] [tires screeching] [honking] He'll be back. With an army. Federal Troops? You asked me to come to you if I had a problem. Fine, Price, fine. I appreciate it. But don't come in here talking about Federal Troops. I'm an old man. You wanna kill me? What do I do if this town fills up with those Roper County people? Am I supposed to release that boy to them? We're releasing no prisoner to any Roper County mob! Want and deputize as many men as you'll need. - I thought about that. - And? And suppose all I can find to help are black men? You can see what will happen, can't you? 'Twenty black men surrounding a jail with shotguns!' All the whole thing will come to is a race riot and all the riot brings is Federal Troops! There you go again with Federal Troops! You do see the problem, don't you? Of course, I see the problem! You think I'm stupid? Look, Price. I'm an old man. I don't see too well anymore. You tell me. Is John Little white or black? Well, I'd say he's kind of, uh off-white. Well, will you do an old man a favor? Will you have a talk with that off-white deputy of yours before you start dropping words around like federal and troops? Alright, Mayor, I'll, uh I'll have a talk with him. Homer! Homer! I have something to say to you. You better pour yourself a Bourbon. A Bourbon, Mayor? Well, you drink while I'm not at home. Might as well drink it when I am. Mayor, you got me wrong-- I haven't had you wrong for a second. Eighteen years you've been with me. Bourbon. [soft music] Pretty flag. Don't try to snow me. You think you've been snowin' me for years. You've had your ear to my keyhole for so long I'm surprised it's not cauliflowered. Year in and year out, you've listened to everything that's been said in this room and then passed the information onto every black man, woman and child in Colusa County. 'Alright.' Oh, come on, Homer. I know you and I know your people. In this county you've always told white people what they want to hear. And then gone off and laughed at '‘em behind their backs. So tell me what I wanna hear now. You can laugh later. Alright, Mayor. But this time what you wanna hear is the truth. I do what I can for the cause. Uh-huh! You listened at the door while Price was in here. You wanted to know whether he'd come to play Footsie with Mr. Charlie, right? Somethin' like that. And if he had and did he wouldn't get a single black deputy when he needed one. 'Am I right?' [soft music continues] We're finally coming to understand one another. Oh, I think we've always kinda understood one another, Mayor. ♪ All the songs of blues [thundering] - You ready? - Nope. I guess I'm as ready as I'm gonna be. Oh, no, no.

Nobody's interested. I'll make a deal with you, Jackson. You keep your mouth shut and I won't slap a knot in your head, okay? My, my, my. [thundering] I, uh arrested a white boy named John Braddock. His daddy came over this morning from Roper County and demanded that I release him. 'I told him that the Judge set the bail. $25,000.' 'And that would be the only way he could get him out.' Well, he didn't... he didn't like that. He left Colusa County madder than a wet hen. [thundering] He'll be back over here. With a lot of those Roper County people. And they're gonna try to bust that boy outta jail. 'As long as there's a breath in my body' 'they're not gonna do it.' 'I know that none of you men voted for me.' 'But it was a fair election and I won.' I'm trying my best to be a good Sheriff. No man black or white can be a good anything without people behind him backing him up. I need backing up tonight. 'I wanna turn those Roper County people' 'around on the highway before they get into town.' Now I've already deputized ten black men to help me. But that'll only make it black against white. And I don't want that. 'No good can come of that.' Well, what do you want from us? Ten white deputies. [murmur] [male #6] 'He's not uppity, he's super uppity.' 'Super nigger, that's what he is.' [crowd murmuring] What about it, Warren? [thundering] John, I'm.. What about it, Warren? [thundering] [chattering] - You wanna know what I think? - We don't. John Little and that black buddy of his have got an overload of guts. [chuckles] Okay, men. You can see the situation. The whites are here to see the fun and our black brothers behind them are sprawling for a fight. When those Roper County people get here they're not gonna take kindly to us. 'So keep everybody cool.' 'Mostly yourselves.' I don't want any shooting unless the Roper County people shoot first. But the one sure thing is that nobody gets through. 'Alright, let's move out.' 'Keep that crowd back and take our positions.' [crowd chattering] How many do you think he'll bring with him? Everybody in Roper County that owes him money or a favor. How many do you think that'd be? Everybody. [thundering] Here they come! What's going on here? I'm afraid you're gonna have to turn around and go back, Mr. Braddock. This is a public highway. Paid for by the people of Colusa County. Now back it up and turn it around like the Sheriff said. I am warning you-- No. Let me warn you. If you try to bust through this road block you're gonna get fired on. I didn't come alone. No, Sir. I can see that. But I hope you told them if they try getting past us they're gonna have to walk through twelve gauge patterns. 'This is Colusa County, Mr. Braddock.'
