1964 Arts Festival entry Shochiku Films The Shape of Night Produced by Akihiko Shimada Based on a work by Kyoko Ota Script by Toshihide Goto Music by Masanobu Higurashi Starring Miyuki Kuwano Mikijiro Hira Keisuke Sonoi Bunta Sugawara, Masayo Iwamoto, Misako Tominaga, Isao Kimura Noriko Sengoku, Akitake Kono, Miyoko Nakamura, Tonbo Zushi, Hideo Madokoro, Yoshiko Hiromura Directed by Noboru Nakamura Are you alone? Do you want to have tea? It's hot. Isn't it hot? Are you cold? The AC is set too low. My name is Fujii. I work for Ito Construction. And your name is? Call me Yoshie. Yoshie... What's your last name? Yoshie is all you need to know. I see. At the construction company, are you an architect? Something like that. Do you make large buildings? We specialize in dam construction. Although now we're working on diverting the flow of water... from the Tone River into the Sumida River. Once finished, 23.4 tons of water will flow into the Sumida River every second. - It will be a little cleaner. - Really? I recently went upriver of the Sumida River... and learned that it's actually clean in Saitama Prefecture. The river suddenly gets dirty when it enters Tokyo. There's a garbage incinerator on the border, and rows and rows of massive factories spew pollution into the river. - Don't you have a girlfriend? - What? I know a place we can go. Make up your mind. I think you'll come with me. Why is a nice girl like you doing this? Enough talk. Doesn't it bother you? - Nope. - Oh, really? Doesn't it feel wrong? A little. But my customers need me. I can't argue with that. But would you be willing to meet me again next Saturday? I'll see you anytime. Every day if you want. But not just for tea. Then I'll see you next time where we met tonight, at around 6:00. Will you be there? I don't know. I'll go if I can. It's been five years... no, six. That's right, I was 19. What are you going to do about school? I don't want to kill myself trying to go to night school. I think I'd learn more just talking to interesting customers. What kind of people come? Young businessmen and literary types. I get to hear a lot about movies and books. - Which side of the station is it on? - The south side. It's a small place, but the owner is a widow that I kind of knew from before. She asked me to help out until she can find someone to work there regularly. Look, I've grown my hair out. BAR Fruit of the Tree - Yoshie, come here and talk. - Nope. Forget it, she only talks to the handsome customers. - So, you're saying that... - That's cold. Do something! She's still a nice girl. Don't fill her head with tawdry ideas. - Good evening, Sir. - Good evening, Sir. - Highball. - Highball, please. You're new here. When did you start? This is my fourth day. - Anywhere before this? - No, this is my first bar job. There you go. - What's your name? - What? - Your name? - Yoshie, good to know you. - Yoshie. Won't you have something? - Why not? - Go ahead. Gin fizz, please. What's your name? Kitami, Eiji Kitame. Good to know you. - Do you work for a company? - Yes. What company? I don't think you'd know it. It's small. Do you go out for drinks often? I'm a silly businessman who just plays mahjong when he drinks. But you have a girlfriend? I'd like one, but unfortunately, I'm all alone. I don't believe you. - There you go. - Gin fizz. - Bottoms up. - Drink up. What time do you finish here? 1:00, but I go home at 12:00. - I'm going home. - Come again sometime. - Cheer up, young fella. - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you, sirs. - Goodnight. Meet me at Fukube at 12:10 Do you know the place? Please come. If you can. - I'm sorry I was late. - It's all right. Don't you have to get up early tomorrow? It's OK if I show up late; it's just dressmaking school. - Where do you live? - Just down the lane. I can get home from here. When can I see you again? Goodnight. Is that you, Yoshie? I thought you finished at 12:00. It's really late. You'll run yourself ragged. Try to come home earlier. You always tell me the same stories. I want to hear something new. How about it, Yoshie? Don't ask me. Hello, sir. Oh, look at you. Good evening. Highball. Long time, no see. Highball, please. Why didn't you come? I've been busy. Also, I don't make enough to come here every night. You could just have one. Try to come more often. OK. What time is it? Two minutes to 12:00. Then it's almost my birthday... May 18. How old will you be? Maybe I shouldn't ask a lady such a question. I don't care. How old do you think I am? Hmmm... 19? No. I'll be 20. It's 12:00. Happy birthday. Thank you. Do you want to go dancing in Shinjuku? We can celebrate like grown-ups. That's a fine idea. Let's go. - Let's go to someplace better. - Anyplace is fine. - I like you. - And I'm crazy about you. Stop! Don't! After that, we always did the same thing when we met. Hotel Crimson Leaf - Full house. - I lost again! - Can I spot you for another hand? - You've had enough. It must be frustrating. You were beating me for a while. You weren't half bad. If you play a little longer, your luck might turn around. True, will you spot me ten chips? - I won big tonight! - I can't believe you. - Still, you're really good. - Beating dim-witted businessmen like him is child's play. What are you talking about? You're a businessman. True enough. You fool, he's a yakuza. Really? Damn... Really? He's a pro... he wouldn't let you win. You should've said something. I couldn't when he was standing right there. He's a yakuza? He seemed like such a milquetoast. They call him Princess and this is his turf. "Princess"? - I don't have to go home tonight. - Oh, yeah? I told my folks I'd be staying at a friend's place. Then, we can spend the night together. The thing is, I'm flat broke. Just the ¥2,000. I have money... I have ¥5,000. Will that be enough? - That should be enough. - Then It'll be my treat. I don't know how to say this... Can't you go out tonight? It's not that... I have an ¥8,000 mahjong debt that I have to pay by tomorrow. I was hoping that you'd loan me the ¥5,000. I can loan you the money. Will you come to my apartment tonight? Your apartment? There's no reason to stay at a hotel again. OK, I'll lend you the money. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry. I can't believe that I'm borrowing from a girl. It's all right. I have the money. Come here. You skipped work at the bar again. It's OK, it's just a part-time thing. Didn't the owner say anything? She said, "You're taking a lot of days off." But I just said that I was tired. Are you going to cooking school? It's not cooking school. It's dressmaking. - What's the difference? - The nerve! I more or less started to live at his apartment. During the day, he didn't ever seem to report to work, and we got by on my meager salary. This is an announcement from Tokyo Electric Power... regarding a suspension of services. Power will be cut from 10:00-13:00 for work on power lines. Work will be cancelled in the event of rain. Will you lend me ¥10,000 till tomorrow? What are you talking about? I don't have any money. You never have any money. I can't count on you. Why would you think that I'd have ¥10,000 on hand? If you don't, you can earn it. It's one of the perks of being a woman. If you wanted it, you could earn it. What are you talking about?! That's not funny! You seem surprised. Did you really think I was an ordinary businessman? I suppose you can't really judge me. You pretend to be a prim and proper dress-making student, when in fact, you're a factory worker. I'm sure that you caught on, but were unable to say anything. Let me spell it out. - In this neighborhood... - Stop! No, you have to hear this. I belong to the Kabuto syndicate, which runs this neighborhood. Stop! Don't cry. I don't have my quota to pay the head office. I'll bring customers. Show them a good time. Please. No! Absolutely not! Don't say that! It's not like it will kill you! Darling! What am I to you? Aren't we lovers?! - Of course we're lovers. - Then, how could you... Do you have any idea how humiliating it will be if I can't pay the head office? - This is beyond the pale. - Do you want me to get hurt?! I don't know. I can't tell what you're thinking?! OK, I understand. So, that's where you and me stand. I guess we're finished. Darling! Get away! You've gotta help me! Just tonight. Right. Only once. Thank you. Thank you, Yoshie. Do you want something to eat? I'll get tempura over rice. I didn't think you'd come. Let's go. I know it doesn't make sense. I'm asking you to give up the life, but I'm also patronizing your services. Still, it's different now. I love you. I didn't want to hear that. I want you to understand. I do love you. I got it. How long have you been doing this? It's hard to remember. Look at all this money! He was a good customer. Not to me, he wasn't. Suck it up! We got ¥5,000 from him. I'm tired. You've got to show them a good time. Your customers aren't people, they're money. And one part of the body is the same as any other. It's like lending a hand or a foot. Count the knotholes on the ceiling boards. I can't compartmentalize like that. It's the same for the customers... They'd be just as happy on top of some other girl. Don't be angry. Maybe I was too indelicate. Cheer up. Yoshie. What do you think? It's great! Throw this away. Thank you very much. Hey, thanks for the other day. - Come again. - I hope to. Hey, Princess. I have to stop by the office. I hope you don't mind. Hold this and wait here. You're being kind today. - Yoshie. - What? Will you start earning money for real? What do you mean? There are tons of girls walking the streets. It's not easy for us to find johns. It's better when johns can see the merchandise right in front of their eyes. So, what do you want me to do? Go out on the street and find customers. What are you talking about?! That's awful! Absolutely not! Keep your voice down. We can live carefree forever. That's what your boss at the office said, isn't it? Yeah. We're to give all of our money to the syndicate, and they'll provide us with a monthly stipend. So, I bust my butt for nothing! We've been paying them a cut all along. It's outrageous that I've been paying them 40%, but this is out of the question. But this apartment and your work is thanks to them, and they'll help us if worse comes to worse. We can't defy the syndicate. I won't do it! I'm not a streetwalker! All right, I won't ask you to do it. I'll get some other skirt to do it. But you have to disappear. I'm going! This isn't a joke! I'm home. Yoshie? Long time, no see, Dad. Where have you been? We were worried. Yoshie, where in the world have you been? You haven't been to the factory. I quit that job. You quit? What do you plan to do then? You know we need the money. Mom, stop. It's so hot, I can't think. I'm home. Hello, Yoshie. - Yoshie, where have you been? - Get off of me! Nothing's changed around here. - It smells good. - Are you perfuming your clothes? - It stinks! - Get your dirty hands off of it! What's the matter with you?! You disappear and when you come back, you're all tarted up. Hey, babe. What? - He's been worried about you. - You mean Eiji? He couldn't come, so he sent us. He said he wouldn't try anything and he just wants to see you. If you don't come, the neighbors might learn that you've been hooking. Did he really say that he wouldn't try anything? - Yep. - Do you promise? Sure. Just come on back. Then tell him I'll see him. You have to come now. Our errand won't be completed until you meet him. He's waiting for you. Wait a second. Just a second. I'll take this. - Where are you going? - He's waiting at the office. He's on the second floor. Is Eiji here? Miss, please come in. What are you doing?! Eiji! Eiji! Eiji, this is happening because you couldn't keep the bitch in line. You must think we're stupid. You can try to escape, but even if you do, we'll be there to tell people what happened here today. I am the first one, hey-ho Hey, Princess, thanks. Hey, Princess, you've got a nice girl. Are you all right? Is something wrong? Is she sick? I'll hail a cab. Shut your mouth! Please forgive me. I had no idea they'd hurt you like this. This area was where we made our money. We have a lot of friends here. Rank novices can feel confident working here, but competition over johns is fierce, so business can be tough until you learn the ropes. We work with this inn. Stay over---¥1,000 Rest---¥600 The official rate was ¥600, but they'd take ¥300 if you're out in an hour. Do I pay there? Yeah, I know the guy, so I pay weekly. You just sign your name. You just stand here and be quiet. Wait for customers to come to you. Stand under the light. I'll be over there. If a john gives you any problems, raise your right hand. If you don't give me the signal, I'll assume it's OK to continue. Understand? Good. Now, go. Be strong. Don't turn your back. Look into the johns' eyes. If he returns your look, smile. OK? I've never seen you here before. What's your name? I'm Keiko. Stop looking around. That's your pimp over there, isn't it? It's obvious. Don't scare the lady, she's new here. What are you talking about? I was just helping her out because she's cute. Look, here comes a sucker now. I've lived in this area for six years, and I've never been here before. It won't be here much longer. Soon it will all be offices. They should make it into a park. It feels good. The smell of autumn is in the air. You don't want to trick, do you? I can help you quit. Walk away from it. I can't. I'm sure it's more difficult... to rid yourself of the yakuza than someone like me can imagine. But you have to get out. Forget about it. Don't you care about your future? Don't women ultimately want to have children... and build a happy home? It doesn't matter for me. It's too late. - Hey, buddy, you're getting wet. - I don't mind. I like your enthusiasm. How'd you like to get wet with a young lady? - Would I ever. - She's a virgin. - A virgin? - It's true. - ¥3,000. - That's a lot of money. Well, she's a virgin. Where is she? Wait at that café. I'll send her over. Make sure she treats me special. Don't you worry about that. Hey. - You waited for me? - It's raining too hard to work. Let's grab a bite to eat and go home. There you go. - Hello. - Good evening. - How are ya? - Drunk off my ass. The world's a mixed-up place. Tonight at 7:30, inside of the main gate of the... National Diet Building, demonstrators and police clashed. And business is down. One of the protesters, Michiko Tamba, a 22-year-old, fourth-year, literature major at Tokyo University, died. Look, somebody died. What is the US-Japan Security Treaty? Beats me! Octopus, please! I'll have red clam. My red clam is also a tasty treat! You're drunk. I can hold my liquor. - Go home and sleep it off. - You go home first. You'll take me home, won't you? Cut it out! Squid, please! Hello, Keiko. What are you looking at? There are so many things I want. Then you should buy them. I really can't. You should get your own place. - You'll breathe easier. - What do you do for fun, Keiko? - I save up my money. - Save for what? To move someplace else. Do you think you can? You can't be a whore forever. It will turn into hell on earth. Have you finished packing? I want to live in an apartment like that one. Do you think I'm made of money? In moments like this, we really look like a couple. We are a couple. I'm talking about a normal couple. Your breath smells! You're the one who stinks of booze. You'll never find a girl who takes care of you like I do. You understand? Cut that out! You understand? I do understand. You're lucky to have a wif like me. Do you understand? Yes, I'm lucky to have a wife like you. Do you really love your wife? Yes, I love my wife to death. You've been pleasuring that guy for hours in there! It was 30-40 minutes long! So what? - I'm not joking! - That hurts! Let me go! Why are you so hot for students?! Or was that one especially good?! - What are you talking about?! - I'm serious! You're the one who said that one john is as good as another. If you can't handle that, I'll stop hooking! Watch your mouth! You wouldn't be able to earn anything without me! What's the hubbub? Don't you love each other? Keep it down here. Hey! What are you doing? I'm tired, let me sleep. You bitch! You love your customers! What are you doing?! You bitch! You can't treat me like that! I'm doing this for you! You think you can treat me like an animal?! You bitch! There was a man who was obsessed with me, who truly suffered because of me. I was tied to this man. I vowed to obey him. You don't know how we live. The way you say that makes you sound poisoned. You should be more open to happiness... and think about how you live. You don't understand. I am happy... in my own way. You're lying. Yoshie? Machiko? It's been years. You're so... - You've gained weight. - Really? I hope not. You look good. I have a family. Come here. This is Yoshie, we were best friends at the factory. - I'm Omachi. Pleased to meet you. - Delighted. I'm Machiko Omachi now; it's too bad I have a funny name now! - Say hello. - Hello. He's cute. - How old are you? - Four. You're a clever boy. This is all I have for you. You're too kind. Say thank you. Thank you. You're a mother now. We have another one on the way. He works at a publishing company, so his salary is low. We can't go on having children like this. What can I do? Yoshie and I... are to be married soon. Oh, really? I'm Fujii. Pleased to meet you. You should've said something. Oh, really? Congratulations. Mommy. It was wonderful to see you. Today was very special for me. - Mommy. - It was nice to meet you. Bye. You fool. I felt like I had to say something. Seeing you together like that... Are you angry? If only the incident hadn't happened... three years earlier... - What happened? - Pull out the futon. - What happened? - Hurry up and do it! There was something of a tussle over our turf. - Eiji was stabbed in the groin. - Has he seen a doctor? - No, we brought him straight here. - He has to see a doctor. Don't worry. These things happen. It'll hurt like hell, but if he rests, he'll be better by tomorrow. - He'll be all right? - I said don't worry. We have to go. - Here's something interesting. - What? I won't be a man anymore. What are you talking about? I'll stop functioning as a man. I won't be able to have sex anymore. The doctor said it with a straight face. That's a horrible thing to say, even as a joke. I called him a dope. I said, "There may be blood in my piss, "but I'll have more sex than you, old man!" You had blood in your urine? - Yeah, two or three times. - I didn't know. What'll you do if I can't perform? Well, I guess I'll finally get a good night's sleep. You knucklehead! What are you talking about? It's cold. We'll both catch colds. Get back under the covers. - I'm tired. - Shut up! You're the one that's shouting. Unlike you, I can't stay in bed all day. - Let me sleep. - What?! Don't pretend like you're busting your butt all day! What's the matter with you? - Do you want tofu? - That sounds good. It's cold, let's get boiled tofu. When did you wash that? Last night. I'm supposed to wash the underwear. Don't worry about it. But the underwear is so... - Are you going to go to the bath? - Yeah. I'll rustle up something for dinner. You should go with me. No, I... You can take care of dinner when we get back, - and I'll help out. - All right. Oh, damn! I'm sorry. - It's the cops! - It's the cops! - It's the cops! Run! - Is this the woman who propositioned you? - Yes. What's wrong with a lady trying to meet a fella? - Shut up, you! - Have you ever met her before? - Do you know her? - It was love at first sight. I knew immediately that he was the man for me. What price did she say? Did she say that it would cost you money? I didn't say anything about money. I told you that I loved you and would follow you wherever you went. - Shut up! - What price did she say? - ¥3,000. - Was it for sex? - It was the price for sex? - Yes. - You're part of the Kabuto syndicate? - Yep. Then you'll be out soon. They're powerful in this neighborhood. How many times have you been pinched? Fewer than I would've expected. You've been working for a while. About three years. Twice in three years ain't bad. I've been arrested more times than I can count. And for the same three years. You ain't got the hang of it yet. How many times for you? This is the last. You're going to escape? To some place that I don't know... and where nobody knows me. I imagine that guy Eiji is devious and cruel. He'll slap you around when he feels strong, but when he loses the power to dominate you, he throws away pretensions of manliness... and plays on your pity, like some kind of gremlin. How can he survive, if I'm not around? I can't just turn my back on him. Don't you get it? You're too trusting. If he beat me like he used to, I wouldn't hesitate to run away with you, but now I can't just leave him. I'm sure he'd be in a fix if you left him, but what do you care if he ends up miserable? There's no reason for your hands to be tied over this. If you leave him, he'll have to learn how to make his own way in life. But he can learn to live by the sweat of his own brow. I don't know, but I imagine he would get by working at... a pachinko parlor, or peddling smutty photos. I believe the real reason you can't let go of him is that... you want to protect him from his friends finding out... that he can't function as a man. You mistakenly believe that it would be wrong to leave him. But the real mistake is you staying with him. - How can you be so cruel? - What? No matter what you say, it won't work! Leave me alone! - No. - I said, leave me alone! Why are you so... Don't you understand?! - I love... - Don't say it! Don't say it! Do you want a back rub? - That's enough. - Why? - I just started. - That's enough. Just a little bit more. I'll press with my fingers. Shiatsu is better than a regular massage. - I really don't want you to continue. - OK. Let's go to bed. I thought I'd try to learn shiatsu. What good would that be? Forget about that. Let's go to bed. I told you I would wash my underwear myself. I have to do the laundry anyway. I have to visit a damn under construction in Hokkaido. - Yes. - The date has been moved up. I'm to go next Sunday. It's going to be for two years. Yes, maybe even for three. I see. I'd like you to come. Listen. I have to admit that... I wanted to save you from your profession right from the start. But things have changed as I've gotten to know you, and now it's completely different. I'm jealous of your pimp, and I love you. I want to live with you, and not like you live now. I want to marry you. Do you know what you're saying? You'll live to regret it. We can meet at the usual spot on Saturday. We'll runaway together. We can stay at a friend's apartment and... take the train out on Sunday morning. You got it? Be there. - What happened? - Keiko died. She was murdered. What happened here?! Why did you break the mirror? Answer me. I didn't like looking at it. What's that? What have you done? I never have any fun. What are you talking about? What did you spend it on? - What does it matter? - It matters! Tell me! The bicycle races. What happened? I lost it. This is a new low. It was a trifling amount. Can't you see that I worked hard to save this money and you wasted it?! - I'll pay you back. - You can't pay me back. You think I'm not good for anything. I'll pay you, even if I have to rob or kill for it. Do it if you think you can! Damn you. Damn you! Are you going to hit me with that?! Eiji. Darling. Who's he? He's a trick. - I saw you with him before. - He's a regular. He always tips me. He's a good customer. You should be good to him. I'll be at the pachinko parlor. You came. Let's go, right now. I need to tell you something. What is it? Aren't you ready? Give me a second. You understand that I really can't wait. I leave tomorrow. You don't have to take anything. Just come. There's nothing to think about. I don't love him... and I have every reason to hate him. But I just can't. Of course you can. What are you talking about? When I told him you were a regular, he said to be good to you. You won't be able to leave the streets so long as you're with him. He's sabotaged your ability to think clearly. You'll eventually get a disease, or get old. Can't you see what a twisted life you're living? Aren't you frightened by the fact that you don't see that your life is depraved, and you're willing to tolerate it? Make up your mind. I won't say it again. We have to go. If you don't leave now, you won't get another chance. Let's go. Come with me. We'll be happy. Take me with you! To be safe, I'll go first and you follow a little later. We'll take different routes to get to Shinjuku Station. We'll meet at 10:00, at the row of telephone booths in the basement. I have to keep going. I can't stop. I have to keep going. I can't stop. I can't stop. I can't stop. I have to go. I have to go. I have to go. I have to go. I can't stop. I can't stop. Done already? It's still early. What's wrong? You look pale. My head hurts. That's no good. I'll take you home so you can rest. I'm hungry. Let's have some noodles. Something to drink? You should lay down. What am I to you? What are you to me? What are you to me? What am I to you? Eiji. Why did you kill Eiji? Was it because you hated him? Then, why did you kill him? Our bond was too much to bear. Do you feel that killing Eiji freed you from that bond? Do you feel free? The End Translated by Scannon Timing by lordretsudo
