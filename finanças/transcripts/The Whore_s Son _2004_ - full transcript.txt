I've killed my mother, my beloved mother. She emerged from her chrysalis and flew up to heaven. I've made my mother Into a soul-butterfly. It didn't turn out the way I thought it would. I never could think like other people. I went to the extra-normal school, and I was always different... to the way ordinary people wanted me to be. And to how my mother wanted me. It's a tragedy. Look at that, Silvija. Your communists certainly know how to put on a show. And it's the workers and peasants who have to pay for it. It's worse than under the emperor. Not so loud! The little one needs to sleep. Can't you be quiet for once? Ozren wants to sleep. You want to drink. Go to a bar! It's my flat. I'll drink when and where I want. He's your child! He'll just scream all night again! You know what? Go fuck yourself. You won't be seeing me again, you Croatian whore! She's crazy! I'll go to the police! THE WHORE'S SON Ante! Silvija, Ozren! We'll give you a lift. Your feet are terribly cold, Ozrenco! Why aren't you wearing your fishing boots? Did your mommy throw you in the Danube? I wasn't far from it. You have to watch out with your cruel brute of a mother. Cruel brute... I was only joking. Say, Maric, why didn't you tell me you had such a beautiful daughter? I'm not his daughter. I'm just her uncle, and it's none of your business. Only asking... No harm in asking. You forgot him. Very funny! Nothing doing today? - No trade. You must come! First I have to look like a human being again! I'll make a human being out of you, boss! Ozren, come on. Ozren, I'm in a hurry! Ozren, are you in there? Open the door! Don't lock it again, you idiot. It's dangerous. It's all right. Ljiljana's late again. My trousers! Look what you've done! What'll I do now? What am I going to wear? I'll be late as it is. Hello, little man, how are you? You're heavy! Look, I've brought you something. You're late again. You're not even ready. They'll throw me out if I'm not careful. That wouldn't exactly be a disaster. You haven't got a child on your back! We'll spend a nice evening together, Ozren. Don't bother clearing up. Oh, I'll do it. And you'll help me, won't you, Ozren? If Father could see you looking like that... Is Mommy beautiful, Ozren? I have to go! Good night! Go to sleep now. Time to get up! Good morning. Fuck off, you whore's son. Wait for me! Let's go. He called me a whore's son. What? - A whore's son! So what, they called me a fucking faggot. What does it mean? What? Whore's son. My Mommy's a waitress. Once again... The secretary writes a letter. The grocer weighs the fruit. The headmistress runs the school. Copy the sentences down. Come on, Ozren, write a bit quicker. And tomorrow you have to write a composition... describing your parents' jobs. So anyone who doesn't know... ask! Till tomorrow! Tomorrow in school I have to write about work jobs. You must learn proper German. Without German you won't get anywhere. But Joschi doesn't understand any more than me. He doesn't even know what a whore's son is. Do you know what it is? What? - A whore's son. The things you want to know... A whore's son... A whore's son... is the son of a whore. And a whore is... a poor woman. A poor woman who sells something that many poor men want. Like a waitress? The Lord Jesus also went among whores. And let he that is without sin cast the first stone! What a load of cobblers he talks... Don't believe a word of it. Your mommy's been a working girl for a long time! This is what she does... Be good, and sleep well! Auntie will be here any minute. What is it? I'm in a hurry. Mommy, what are you... as a job? Teacher said we have to know for a test. What I... What my job is? But I'm a waitress. You know that. That's why I'm always in a rush. Sleep well! Good morning, my little one. You'll have to get a move on. Who was that last night? Nobody. Get up! I wet my pajama bottoms. I've told you hundreds of times... not to drink so much before bedtime. Into the shower with you. It's our Christmas party in school today. I'm singing. You've got to come. Of course I'll come. Now up you get! Don't lose it now! For the break... Let's meet in front of the school. Will you tell Auntie Ljiljana? No, only you can come. I only sing for my Mommy. All right. Have it your way... I'll be waiting outside the school at ten to four. I'm proud of you already. Think of the tune. Then it's much easier to learn it by heart. Come on, Ozren! It's starting. But... But I don't know the words yet. It doesn't matter! Everyone'll be singing. Just move your lips. I'd like to welcome all the parents and relatives, friends and children... to the Christmas party of Class 3C. As usual, we've prepared a little program. To begin we're going to sing a well-known Christmas carol... and we'd like you to join in. Will you look at that. They get younger all the time. 'Evening, young man! Fancy a beer? But he's much too young. I was only talking about a beer. He can have a swig. We'll soon see whether he's too young. That's the way. Not bad, my friend. Drinking like a man already. What's your name? We'll have to remember this young lad. Do you live here? But that's Monique's son. Well I'll be. So it is. You're a proper young man already. Not bad. My Mommy's name is Silvija. And she's a waitress. They don't mean to be nasty. But your mommy isn't a waitress. You ought to know that. There are no waitresses living here. And your mommy has lots of names. Look at those two there, they're not really called Cherie und Tamara either. Leave the poor little lad alone. This lad will soon be a man. He has to know what's what. Come with me. Let me show you something. You mustn't tell anyone. Word of honor! Do you understand? That's enough now. Can't have you being corrupted. What do you think of Natasha, then? Not bad, eh? But it's just between us men. Not a word to your mommy. She always gets annoyed over nothing as it is. Why do they have a different name when they do that? So it's not the same as at home. Now off to bed with you. Did you sing nicely, my mucky little pup? Are you angry with me? Are you angry I didn't come? I couldn't get away from work. Never do that again! Time to get up! You'll be late for school. Here. And put your scarf on. But I'm not cold, Mommy. It's cold and you never have enough clothes on. Julia, look at the scarf Ozi gave me. Good morning. Sit down, please. I'd like to introduce a new pupil. This is Snezana. She comes from Bosnia in Yugoslavia... and from today she'll be with us. Please be nice to her. Snezana comes from a region where there's a war going on. She can't speak German yet, but that will come... when she's gotten used to being with us. Take out your books and turn in your homework. Despite evident losses the Serb forces intend to leave... their heavy weapons in position around Sarajevo. "To protect the civilian population", said Serb leader Karadzic today, while admitting that the NATO attacks had caused extensive damage. Gran's sure to be watching TV over at her neighbor's. What if the phone's not working... and the telephone masts have been blown up? The war's in Bosnia, not in Slavonia any more. But what if the war comes back to Slavonia? What will be, will be. That's what all Holy Joans say. What's a Holy Joan? Your uncle doesn't know what he's saying. You must forgive him. Your aunt is a respectable widow, but she doesn't know anything about the world. You'll be the death of me, you bloody foreigners! You shouldn't swear all the time, Silvija. Curses offend God and please the devil. Rubbish! The two of them sit down every evening at a big table, eat meatballs together... and drink out of the same bottle of slivovitz. But Ozren, you can't be full already. Here, have a bit more. Thanks. What's wrong with you? First you're late, then you don't want to eat. Why haven't you got any children? You love children! Your Uncle Ivo shouldn't've fallen off that scaffolding. It just wasn't meant to be. God knows what he's doing. Do you believe God exists? But of course He does! What do you think! Uncle Ante says not even the Pope knows. You mustn't believe everything your uncle says! There are things he understands nothing about! Does God love me more, or Mommy? Your mommy loves you as a mommy loves her child, but God... loves you as only God can love you. And what's that like? You'll see. Look, Ozren, I've found something else. You're going to like these. Try them on. Have you got the right size? Don't make such a fuss about nothing. Do you like these trousers? - Nice, very nice. You've no idea how lucky you are. Maybe they'd fit you? No, thanks very much. You can choose something else. I don't need anything. Under our Great Marshal... we didn't need so much! And you weren't allowed to open your mouth... under your precious Marshal Tito. That kind of idiotic talk gives me a headache. Look at that mess! What are you doing with your new things, Ozren? I do everything so you don't have to run around like a street cleaner, and this is the thanks I get? Why don't you run along to your Austrian fancy-men? Who do you think you are? I earn more in a week than you do in a month. And I still have to support him. Idiots, both of you! In school we learnt that one can suspend the laws of nature. Really? Yes, in religious instruction. The priest transforms the host... into the body of Jesus Christ and the wine into his blood. Our Great Marshal... was also able to... Shit! Close your eyes and count to ten! Listen, all of you, my lad's called Ozren... and he's inspired! He's brighter than all of you, but you don't understand, you fools! You idiots! Long live Ozren the Inspired! Three cheers for Ozren the Inspired! Cheers, you idiot! Have we got family in Bosnia, too? My brother lives there. That's my brother Zoran... and his wife, Marija. Zoran and me, we quarreled. Over politics. We haven't spoken to each other... for over 30 years. Try a glass. Down in one. Auntie Ljiljana says... if you don't believe in God you won't go to heaven. You mustn't believe everything your aunt tells you. Do you believe in God? It's not a matter of whether I believe in God. It's whether he believes in me. I'll carry your bag if you like. You must be ill, my little one. But even if you are, you've got to eat. I had a hotdog earlier on. Don't tell me stories. I can see when you're unhappy. And you are unhappy. I am unhappy, in a special way. There's a new girl in our class. Snezana... That sounds Serbian! Forget her, or it'll only end in tears. Where are your new trousers? And where's the checked scarf? - I don't know. And who does know? The trousers... they split. And I turned the scarf into a pass-on present. You did what with it? - I gave it to someone. But why? Didn't you like it? Yes, I did. But Mira liked it too. We send what we can afford to our family. They really need it. Are you in love with this Mira? No. I'm in love with... Snezana. But the scarf... Mira liked it so much. I don't work for all those other idiots too! Won't that go into your bird brain? Go back into the classroom. Come, Ozren. You obviously have no idea what hunger's like. Does that mean they shouldn't wash? A drop to drink can't do any harm. I wouldn't want to go through a war with you two. Who'd want to anyway... It's not as if Uncle Zoran will actually get the parcel. One should never give up hope. What on earth are you doing? You can't be serious... cans of Coca-Cola? But I know they need them in Bosnia... from school! What the hell do you learn in that morons' school? You put those cans back on the shelves right away. Cretin! Snezana, wait! What the hell do you want, idiot? Sweet dreams. Is it true that Snezana's a Serbian name? Love strikes where it will. A Serbian girl is no worse a person than a Croatian... or an Austrian girl. Sleep well. Uncle Ante... Is it true that brain fluid leaks out if you...? Quite the reverse! At your age bashing the bishop... is a preventive health measure! You just lose tiny children, but only half-children! Not even half-children... Don't worry... In my youth I was Slavonian world champion. But now that's me! - Well, I'm getting old! Good night. What are you doing? I asked you a question! ...to the toilet! This can't go on, Ozren. Why don't you go before you go to bed? But I did! I can't have you waking me up every night. Well, get on with it before you wet yourself! Ozren? Are you in there? You can't sit out here, it's too cold! Open up, please. I'm sorry, Mommy! It's OK. Come on. Good, isn't it? Would you like a dessert, something sweet? I have something important to say to you, Ozren. I know what you mean. We forgot to buy something for Uncle Ante. No. I want to talk to you about something else. You'll be grown up and finishing school soon, and our flat's too small for both of us. I'm going to leave it to you! You won't be lonely at all. At dinnertime you'll go to Auntie Ljiljana's as usual... and then you can read or watch TV or do... whatever you want. And Uncle Ante'll come round every evening. And I'll come by every Sunday. I'll put enough money in the drawer... so you can buy everything you need. Would you like anything else? The bill, please. Come out of there. There's no point locking yourself in there. Mommy doesn't want me. It's because there's not enough room here. You'll see, when she moves out, you won't quarrel so much. But I don't want her to move out. Look at it like this: you'll be master in your own home! And you'll have your own toilet! With your own toilet you'll be twice the man you were! It's great she's moving out! No one to interfere any more! What do you mean? I mean you can do whatever you want. Parties, chicks... Everything. And if you want, you can visit her. What are you so upset about? I'd be glad if I were you. Take good care of yourself. Right. When it rings, you phone Auntie Ljiljana... and say: "Good morning!" Yes. And now go to sleep like a good boy. Uncle Ante... Mommy forgot... to give me her address. It's better that way! Why is it better? Good night. Follow that car! What now? Carry straight on! Beat it! Stop following me! Or I'll go to the police and report you... and your stupid passenger for sexual harassment! Get out now. End of the line. Are you crazy, spying on me like that? I've told you a hundred times you mustn't do that. I don't want to hear your excuses. Don't ever do that again! 'Morning, Osi. What happened? Even the smoothest tongue is useless sometimes. It would be much better to have your muscles. You'll have to take over here today, Ozren. I have to see a doctor. Mercedes Bar. Yes... No... He had to see the doctor. - What's with him? His eye's all black. - He's got nerve. But I'll get everything done, don't worry. Come on! Help me up. I can't... I don't want to make a whore's son like me. Idiot... Forget it! There's no charge. Get back to work, or the boss'll make mincemeat out of us. Where is he? Everything's tip-top. Peppi should be grateful to you. And you'll get something extra from me today. Was everything all right? - Wonderful. Couldn't be better. Ankica, another glass of wine, please. Coming up, Ante! Why haven't you got a wife, Uncle Ante? Because I like all of them so much. And Mommy? Why hasn't Mommy got a husband? Your mommy... You know why. It's Silvija's birthday soon. Have you got her a birthday present yet? We should call her and ask... what she wants. Did I pay? Yes, Uncle Ante. One must always... bay. Pay, Uncle Ante... How about that? Good night. Yes... Hello, who's speaking? Can I speak to your mommy? - Just a moment, please. Hello? Who's speaking? Are you angry with me? Then don't behave as if I were invisible! You wouldn't like that, would you? What's up with Ozren? What are these stories I'm hearing? Look, Ozren, some things one doesn't talk about, you're quite right. But I just love talking about these things. If you go on like that you'll go through the surface! So, what have you got to tell us? You know all about it anyway! Now you won't be able to think about anything else! Let's drink to that. The lad's grown up! Oh, really? And how does one "grow up" round here? Shut up! No, you stay here. You don't give orders around here! Doing it in secret doesn't make you any better than us! You'll hear what I've got to say! Women! What's the difference when it's secret? - The price. And my Mommy does it in secret? Super extra-secret. You leave my boy alone. He's still just a kid! So now he's a kid again? Then why not look after him, instead of letting him work here? I take care of him, don't you worry. You know what? The best thing you can do is... leave him alone and fuck off back to your private practice! Oh, Monique... What's the matter? Don't touch me! You disgusting whore! You must look for another job. This can't go on. See, Ozren? I've brought you some new things, and I've cleared out your cupboard. Where are my yellow pajamas? They were all worn through and much too small for you. You can't just throw my things away! What? Where are my yellow pajamas? Without me you'd soon be running around naked! I'd never run around naked. Or undress in front of strangers. Not for all the money in the world! Only a whore like you does that. Hello there, this is Monique, a special lady... ... a very special lady. Let me spoil you... Hello there, this is Monique, a special lady... ... a very special lady... Let me spoil you... I'll fulfill all your desires, whether you like it strict or tender. I'll be waiting for you in my discreet private apartment... downtown, at Franz-Josefskal 33, Apartment 21. Yes? - Robert! Come up quick as you can! You're already here? You can get undressed! I'll be right with you. Here I am, my little one. Mommy's all ready for you. You can't come in yet, Robert. Come back in half an hour. But Monique, I'm so horny already. I'm sorry. - Is there someone else there? No, it's a private problem. Do you need help? I'll throw him out! No thanks, it's fine. We agreed on 5 o'clock. - Just leave me alone for a bit. You can't do this to me! - Please, Robert, just go! I'll have terrible problems with the neighbors! Please! Open the door, now! I'm sorry, I can't right now. Holy Mother of God! I told you not to come here. You've known for ages that... that your mommy's a whore. What were you thinking of? What's that? For your birthday... For my birthday... Travel voucher You'll have to go now! You mustn't look at those. You're so beautiful, Mommy. Are you really that stupid? Can't you understand that you mustn't come here? Is that so hard to understand? You have to go now! "Mommy! Mommy!" I don't want to hear it anymore! You shouldn't have come! And take that with you! I've killed my mother, my beloved mother. It didn't turn out the way I thought it would. I never could think like other people. I went to the extra-normal school, and I was always different... to the way ordinary people wanted me to be. And to how my mother wanted me. It's a tragedy. She's probably still flying around as a soul-butterfly, not really knowlng what to do. After all, she's unemployed now, because there's no secret prostitution in heaven. There everything's revealed. I don't want to die yet, for not even the Pope knows if God really exists. That's an open world secret, too. Open the door! Don't leave me on my own!
