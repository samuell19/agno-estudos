- Mommy. Mommy. Mommy! - What? What? Are you okay? - I can't find the clicker. Okay. It's right here. And what is with the glasses? - My friend Julia said that blind people wear glasses. Really? You know what? People only wear sunglasses to look cool, and you don't need to look cool, because you already are cool. So you don't need them. And you're not blind. - Not yet. - Come on. Let's just go back to bed for a few more minutes, okay? We'll snuggle. - Time for more sleep. sing with me, mommy. - No, no, no. - Yes, yes! Sing with me, mommy. - Hey, hey, hey, get Kenny. Get Kenny. Hey! You want a knuckle sandwich? Get Kenny. Get my baby. mulligan the rabbit. - Ouch, my tooth. - Good-bye, everybody! - And cut. We are clear. - Hurry up. Let's go. Come on, guys. Get this head off of me. - Kenny, what happened, baby? - My tooth broke. - Let's go. Hurry up. I'm dying here. Hurry. Let's go, guys. Come on, come on. Let's get it done. Hurry. Come on. Hey, guys, I said I wanted a ventilation fan put in there. Okay? - It's bad for audio. Good for you. Look at me. I'm marinating in a pool of sweat. Get it done. - Hey, who do I talk to about this? - Try the tooth fairy. - Hey, you can't talk to US that way. My son is the star of this show. - Your son's lucky to be a glorified extra. Tell him to lay off the candy, his teeth won't fall out. - Toast. - All righty. Ooh, perfect. There you go. - Good morning. And how is my birthday girl? - My birthday isn't for a whole 'nother week, grammy. - It's okay. I think birthdays should be celebrated all month long. Sorry I'm late. - Anyone seen my keys? - Check your coat pocket. - Hey, baby, can you go get your backpack yourself? - Okay. - Is that okay? Yeah, 'cause we don't want to be late for school. Again. - I found her wearing these this morning. I'm worried she's giving up. - Well, she won't if you don't. I mean, you're doing everything you possibly can. - Yeah. - Come on, baby. Okay, I have my cell phone if you need me. I love you. Be a good girl for grammy, okay? - Okay. - Thanks, mom. - Bye. Love you. - Bye. Come on. Come... Please. Come on. Thank you. Okay. - Dick brockton's office. - Yeah, it's Eddie. Is dick there? - How many times has he called me already this morning? - Four. Dick, he's... Down. - He's... he's what? - Down. He's safe. He's out! Yes, he's out. - Adam, you're a terrible liar, I can hear him wheezing in the background. Put him on the phone. - Wait. He just stepped in. - Eddie, my boy, how's things? I just ran up the stairs when I heard it was you. Ready to roll on the biggest audition of your life? - No pressure there. Thanks for that. - What are you talking about? I just did a whole dog and pony show on you. This director's on pins and needles. He is so excited to meet you. - Telling you, if this doesn't work out, i'm... I'm done. I got to get out of the bunny suit. I am dying a slow death in there, okay? - And I'm telling you, this guy loves you. He saw you in a play down in la jolla. That Shakespeare thing. - Dick, hamletis not a Shakespeare thing. - Eddie, all you have to do is show up and it's in the bag. - Right. Hey, we still on for dinner tonight? - Definitely. We will be celebrating your first step... Giant... - Dick. Dick? Dick? - All right. I am busy. - D-Dick? Margaret, i... i told you already. I... i love you. - Come on. - Come on, baby. Yeah. - Let's go! Come on! Move it! - Yeah, hold your horses, buddy! I'm trying! Aah! - Calm. This is not happening. Aah! Aah! Where did you learn how to drive? No, no, no! Look what you did to my car. You see that? - No, I can't, 'cause I'm stuck. Little help here. This is really... All right. Great. Get in here. - Just push it. Really? - Yeah. That's gonna leave a Mark. This day is getting better and better. - I'm fine and you're fine, and I'm late for a very important meeting, so you just go ahead. I'll take care of my car. - What? Your... what about my car? - That's called cash for clunkers, honey. Take care of it. - You know what? I... i am in a hurry to go somewhere very important too. - What? A hoedown? - I happen to be a waitress at old susana's, thank you very much. You are not going anywhere until you pay for the damage to my car. - What? What are you talking about? You hit me. - You cut me off. - What? Look at you. You look absurd. You look like a hood ornament. Get out of the way. No, I'm not going anywhere. Staying right here. - All right, all right, come here. All right, look, okay. You know what? Let's do this. Let's just do it quick. Here. Driver's license, registration, here we go. Come on. Ha! Crazy woman. - Nice try, buddy. Jerk. - It's gonna be close. No. No, no, no. Why is the universe against me? Is it 'cause I play a rabbit? - Morning, officer. I... I'm really sorry to waste your time. I know I was speeding a little bit. I'm on my way to this huge audition... Excuse me. Rough day. - License and registration. - Right, right. And, you know, I got a lot of friends that are police officers, so I wouldn't even ask if it wasn't... - license and registration. - Right. Right. Fine. Give me the ticket, but maybe we could just hurry, all right? Hope you choke on a glazed doughnut. A comedian? Citing you for the broken taillight. - Wonderful. Wants my Regis... Tration. Boy. Officer, I, I know you got a hard job here. Um, you're not gonna believe this. I... i actually... I think maybe I left my registration back at the house. Maybe, maybe just take a look at the car and know that, you know, it's legit. You're not buying this. - I'm sorry, Mickey. It won't happen again. - That's what you said yesterday. - Cut her some slack. She was in an accident. She could have been hurt. - I'm glad you're okay, Annie, but I mean it. Next time you're late, out. - He's all bark. So, this guy in the Mercedes, is he cute? You said he was an actor. Did you recognize him? No. I've never seen him before, so he must be a nobody. He's cute. What kind of Mercedes did he drive? - The hit and run kind. - There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for all this. Come on, look. I can straighten all this out with one phone call, prove the car belongs to me. I mean, I get a phone call, right? Hey. I know my rights. - I got this one. - Look, please, I made a mistake. I beg you. Look, officer, you can keep the watch. - Old susana's. - This is sergeant Castro at the Beverly Hills police department. Did someone there have a car accident today? - Well, maybe. But... but it wasn't her fault. - Just put her on the phone, please. - Annie. - Yeah? - It's for you. It's the police. Maybe you killed that guy. - One can only hope. Hello? - Who am I speaking with? - Annie benchley. - Perfect. I have a Mr. Eddie avedon here in custody who says you have his driver's license. - Okay, you want me to tell you about that guy? He ran into me and then left me for dead. Yeah. He tried to kill me. - She says you left the scene of an accident and tried to run her over. Right? What? No. No, I mean, a little, but she hit me, officer. - You know, if you'd like, you can come down to the station and press charges. - Let me just talk to her for a minute, okay? 30 seconds. - Hold on just a sec. Make it quick. - Thanks. Hello, Ms... - Annie. - Annie. Right. Listen, there seems to be some confusion as to the ownership of my vehicle. I don't know why. Would it be because you left without your registration? - Yes. That... that would be it. Listen, I would consider it a huge, personal favor if you could come down here with both my license and registration, which, by the way, you stole from me. - Stole from you? - No, no. Took. Took. - You tried to kill me, pal. - It's... it's... it's Eddie. - Okay, Eddie. Fine. I will come there. - Perfect. Perfect. Thank you. - If you promise to get my car fixed. - Absolutely. Fixed, done. Good as new. Or at least as good as it was. But can you make it quick? There's a bunch of lowlifes down here. - I'll be there as soon as my shift ends. - Perfect. So when's that? About seven more hours. - Seven. Seven hours. No, that... wait. - Bye. - Annie, hello? - All right, handsome. Come on. - Who you calling a lowlife? - Hi. I'm Annie benchley. - I'm here for... - It's about time. I don't know if I could take much more. I got this. Follow me, please. - Please. I beg you. Don't... don't do it. Don't do this. Just give me another chance. - "Margaret, how can I help you if you can't help yourself?" - No, no, no, no, no. You're Margaret, so you don't have to read the name Margaret, okay? And put a little life into it, okay? Here, let's try it again. - Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. I'm a girl? - It's called acting. All right? Yeah. Let's do it again. - "How c..." - "How..." - "How can I help you if you can't help yourself?" - That's ridiculous. - It was better. - You nailed it. - Let's go, Pacino. - Hey, you think I could get an agent? - No. - From now on, I wish you wouldn't use the police department to play whatever sick games you two play. And don't get me wrong, I just spent eight hours with this guy, so I understand why you'd want to leave him in here. - It's not a bad idea. - Your boyfriend even tried to bribe me with his rolex. - Hey, come on, I wasn't serious. You know how much that thing is worth? - Okay, he's not my boyfriend. - You can still press charges if you want to. - For what? - How about leaving the scene of an accident, threatening bodily harm with a vehicle, dangerous driving, and anything else the nice young lady would care to add on today. - No. Not right now. Look, I'm in a hurry. - Okay. Sign right there, and he's free to walk. - Great. Thanks for springing me. Now where are my wheels? - Impounded. Here's the release form. - Im... impounded. This, this is perfect. You know, this is an $80,000 car. I just really want to thank you for all you've done. - Don't mention it. - My car, my career... And let's not forget about the fine guys you caused me to spend time with in lockdown. That... that was nice. - Me? No, no, no. This is your fault. And I can press charges. You're lucky I don't, right? - Absolutely. - Since you're not... - At this moment. - Since you're not at this moment, then my only link to you is that I know you work at old susana's. Yeah. And I can only hope it'll be hit by lightning and crash to the ground. - You are incredible. - You're telling me. - Hey, buddy, do you mind? - Yes, I do, and it's sergeant. - Okay, what about my car? You promised you'd fix it. - Yes. Yes. The reason for the worst day of my life. Here. Call this number. It's my manager. He handles my finances. This nightmare has finally ended. I have my benz, you have your hornet, and hopefully when you walk out that door, you will take a right, I will take a left, and neither of the two shall meet again. - Fine by me. - Hey, superstar, you might want to head to the right too, because the impound lot is five miles that way. Closes in, six minutes. Wait. Wait. - Wait. Wait, Annie. - I thought we were never gonna see each other again. - The impound lot closes in six minutes. - So? - So I need a ride. Please. Come on. I'm begging you. - You've got some nerve. You call me down here and all you do is insult me. - Well, that was then. - Yeah, and now you want a ride? Why don't you call your manager? I've done my good deed for today. - Wait. Please. I'll give you $20. - 50. Wait, I will give you $100. Just to give me a little ride down the street. $100. Think about that. That... that's a lot of tips? - Fine. - Yes! - Get in. - Yes. Okay. Go, go, go. - But no funny stuff. I've got mace. - Okay. - Sorry, it's a little temperamental. - Go! Go! - I think we made it. Okay. - Sir, sir, I know I'm late, but I'm here. Look. Sir, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just made it? Look at this. I got the paperwork and everything. Buddy. Buddy, I'm here. Please. Sir! Sir, please! I'm right here! Please, I think we can do this, okay? Wait. You know what? You don't have to get back in to give me my money. - This just isn't my day. I'm sorry to hear that. I have to get going, so you got my hundred bucks? - I could really use a ride home. - You're an actor, right? - Yeah. - Why don't you act like you know how to take a bus? Hey! Hey, hey, what about my hundred bucks? - You're a waitress, right? - So? - Here's a big tip. Don't be so gullible. Baby, it's so late. I was worried about you. I've already put Taylor to bed. I know. I'm sorry. I had an accident this morning. - An accident? - Yes. - What? - You know what? I don't even want to talk about it. - I mean, are you okay? Maybe I should call Dr. Lupida's son. - Okay, mom, Dr. Lupida's son... Not a doctor. - You don't have to get so technical. I'm sure he's been around his dad enough to administer a little first aid. - I'm fine. - Sit down. Tell me all about it. This guy, he was... He was so... - Single? - That's it, mom. Come on. - What? It's been almost three years. You know, it's time to get back on the horse. - I'm not having this conversation. - Phil was a great guy. He was funny and... and cute. - And smart. - Well, not smart enough to have life insurance. I'm sorry, but he left you nothing. - He left me with Taylor, and she's everything. - I know. I know. But it's time to let go and move on. I mean, and not just for your sake. For Taylor's too. I have to go. I have a date. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. Bye. - Love you. - Love you too. - What the... Scott. Scott! - Yo, bro, what's up? I got some great news, bro. - Look at this place. It looks like a bomb went off. - I just had a few friends over, dude. - Look, you're my best friend and all, but this little weekend visit has turned into a six-month stay. - And you promised me you'd look for a job. - That's what I'm trying to tell you, bro. I got one. - Just tell me it's better than Hawking tanning creams door to door? - Hey, when this city wakes up to the realities of skin cancers and "melanomananas," you're gonna get all your money back, bro. Word. - Right. Tell me about the new gig. - I got a part in a movie. So you're an actor now? - Yeah. - Last week you wanted to manage heavy metal bands, and now you're an actor. - Yeah. Well, okay, here's what happened. Okay, yes. Well, all right. So, the other night, I'm over at the club, right? And I meet up with this super casting agent chick. A bit of a coug. But turns out that she's auditioning this movie, and the director is a friend of mine. - When did you start hanging out with film directors? - I was on that celebrity softball team, remember? - But you're not a celebrity. - No. I was a ringer. Okay, so anyways, I'm at the audition, boom goes the dynamite, I land the role, baby. - Boom? I'm so glad I trained at Juilliard for four years. - Me too! You can give me tips. Hey, and your manager called. Man, he was mad. Can I borrow the Mercedes tonight? - It got impounded. - Bummer. That means I'll have to take the bus. - You know, it's one thing to stand me up, but when you blow off a big league director like Blake levans, that's just like saying, "I don't want to work anymore." - I didn't blow anyone off, dick. - This was a slam dunk, Eddie. - You think this isn't killing me? - Are you having personal problems? - Person... what? - Eddie, I've been handling you from the beginning. You call me ten times a day complaining about the rabbit. I still return your calls. I love you like a son. You can level with me. Is it girl trouble? - Yes. Well, no. Well, yes, trouble with a girl, but... - Annie, right? - Wh... how'd you? - She called today, left a message. "I know things got heated yesterday, but I hope he'll do the right thing." If this thing gets out in the press... - What thing? - The baby. - What baby? - That's it. Deny, deny, deny. Especially when the tabloids start calling. - Look, no, no, look. Annie, this girl, she's crazy. She hits my car. She stole my license. She sent me to jail, dick, which is why I couldn't make my meeting and why I couldn't call you. - So she's definitely not having your baby? - Just pay her whatever she wants to go away. As soon as she's out of my life, the better. - So you'll never guess who I ran into today. Jeffrey bramowitz. - That creepy kid from high school? - He was sweet. And he had a big crush on you. - Crush? I think they call that stalking, mom. He was going bald. By high school he had a toupee, I think. - Well, you should see him now. - No thanks. - He's a plastic surgeon. And he must have done some work on himself, because he looks like a movie star. No, I don't care if he looks like George Clooney. I don't want to go out with Jeffrey bramowitz, mom. No, thank you. - okay, what are you selling? - Come on, Annie. I wrote that original song just for you. It won, fourth place in the talent show. Do you remember? - Jeffrey bramowitz? Yeah, yeah. Except, now it's Dr. Jeffrey bramowitz. - Jeffrey! - Hey! - Good to see you. Come in, come in, come in. - Hey. How are you? Did I mention that he invited US all to dinner? No, you didn't, mother. You know, Jeffrey, tonight is not a good night. - My daughter isn't feeling very well. - I'm ready. - Well, looks like she's feeling better. So she says, "I was born looking this way." You know what I said? "It's my job to make sure you don't die looking that way." - Jeffrey is one of the top surgeons in his field. I'm not only the top surgeon. I'm also my best client. - Remember me from high school? - Kind of hard to forget. - No movie star there. - Whoopsie. Where did that go? - Um, excuse me, could we... Is there another table? - What's the matter with this one? - Yeah, what's wrong with this one? - All the other tables are full right now, sir. - You know what? It's fine. We're done. Can we just get the check please? - Of course. - Do you two know each other? - Yes. This is the infamous Annie. The girl with the baby. - What baby? - I'm not a baby. - I'm sorry. You are... - This is Eddie. Hit and run Eddie, mom. The jailbird. Yeah. Am I missing something here? - Eddie and I had a Fender bender recently. Small world running into you again. - "Running into." That's cute. You're not missing anything. - So, Jeffrey, being a world famous plastic surgeon, do you find yourself with a lot of wannabe actors coming in, wanting to look better? - Well, not really. It's mostly women in their 30s, trying to extend their youth. - Ha. Not... That you would need anything, Annie. I think you're perfect. You know what? Why don't you come by tomorrow night? I'm giving a speech at the a.M.A. You know what? Why don't you come down? Come watch me do my thing? - Sounds riveting. - It will be. - Riveting. - She'd love to. - Really? - So I heard back from Blake levans today. He made an offer. - That's... that's incredible. Blake levans made a straight offer. I didn't even have to audition. - Not to you. To somebody else. In all the years I have managed you, I've never seen anyone self-destruct as... - excuse me, did you just say you're his manager? - I left you a message this morning. - Right. You're on my call-back list. First thing tomorrow. - You know what? Forget it, okay? Excuse me. If I could just borrow that for a second. Look, I just want my car fixed, okay? Here's my number, my address for the estimate. And you better call me, buddy, because if you don't, I will file a police report, and you know I still can. - Fine. Fine. You know what? This one is on Eddie. That's for the hundred bucks you owe me. And, um, here's a tip... Leave a big one. Come on, baby, let's go. - So, see anything you like? - "I beg of you with all my soul. "Help me. I want to be a better man." Better man? Want to be a better man. Better man. - What are you doing? - Just running my lines. - Why are you reading from my script then? - You're in this movie too? - Wait a minute. What's the name of your director friend? - Um, Blake... Lemons? Limes? Blake limes? No. Levans? - Yeah, that's my softball buddy. Yeah, how awesome is it we're gonna be in the same movie, bro? Hawaii. We can go surfing. That's gonna be sweet. - Excuse me. - Hey, so which part do you play? - That was my job. - Is that the detective? - Evening, Mrs. Benchley. Welcome. Come in. Come in. I got you a little gift for reconnecting me with your daughter. You shouldn't have. Honey, there's a doctor in the house. - Jeffrey, what are you doing here? - You wanted to hear my speech tonight. - What is this? It's my non-surgical facelift kit. It helps with facial sagging. Thank you. So is my girl ready? - You know, Jeffrey, it just slipped my mind. Well, not a problem. I can wait. It's not like they can start without the keynote speaker. Go ahead, honey. I'll watch Taylor. By the time you come home, we could look like sisters. I'll get that. - Hello? - Hi. It's Eddie avedon. You asked me to call you about the estimate? - Yes, I did, Eddie avedon. Where the heck are you? - What? - You know what? I have been waiting a half hour for you. - W-What are you talking about? - You better get over here in the next 20 minutes, or I am going to press charges. Yeah, and you better bring your checkbook too. And the check better not bounce. - Hello? A... - Who was that? - You know, Jeff, I am so sorry, but that guy, Eddie, is gonna come over, and we have to work out the insurance money. - Are you sure it can't wait until tomorrow? Yeah, I'm sure if I don't get my money tonight I might never see it. You saw him. He's kind of flaky. His eyes did seem a bit shady. But that's nothing a shot of Botox wouldn't fix. - Okay, you know what? I am just gonna take a rain check then. Well, then maybe the two of you should pick another time to get together right now. - In fact, my schedule is rather... - You know what? I have double shifts all weekend. - Well, i... I'm sure I could free myself up. Annie, wh... - she'll call you, Jeffrey. - No, I won't. - You are crazy if you let a doctor get away. - I love you! Hey...... - Annie, the jailbird is here. Hi. Come on in. Come on in. I'm not gonna bite you. Looks good? - What are you doing here? - You just told me to be here in 20 minutes or you were gonna call the cops. - Well, you didn't believe me, did you? - You're crazy, aren't you? - Certifiable. So, tay, do I look any younger? - Aren't you? You got the estimate? - Yes. Come in. - Are chihuahuas really smarter than other dog breeds? We'll put the little chi chis to the test later. But first, Hollywood's gone hot for Scott. Newcomer Scott dunbar has just signed on to shoot opposite a-list starlet Jillian beaudry in Honolulu dangerous. We sat down with Scott earlier today. Here's what he had to say. - Well, make yourself at home, why don't you? - working really hard and focusing on my craft. Getting... getting crafty. And this is just my shot, you know? I mean, you say "Hollywood," I say Holly should, could, and did. You know? Hey, watch out, world, 'cause I'm coming at you. - Wow. He really does have that Hollywood charisma, doesn't he? - Charisma. Unbelievable. - Hi. I'm Taylor. - Hey. Eddie. - Shake his hand, honey. - It's weird. You sound like mulligan. Taylor's crazy about this show mulligan the rabbit. - Yeah, I know mulligan. You like mulligan? - She's obsessed with him. - He's the best thing in the whole world. - Well, he's not that great. - Is too. - Is not. Trust me. Okay, why don't we get you on up to bed? Mom, can you please... - yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, baby. I'll read you a bedtime story. Thanks. - Can I meet mulligan? Please? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Why not? - Yay, did you hear that? I'm gonna meet mulligan. - Yeah. Right. - Here's the estimate. - All right. Well, don't worry, it won't bounce. - You know, you probably shouldn't have said that to her. - Who? - Taylor, my daughter. The thing about meeting mulligan. Now when she doesn't, she's gonna be disappointed. - Look, if I say she can meet mulligan, she can meet mulligan. Okay, yeah. And how's that gonna happen? - Well, I'll have my friend leave your name at the gate, okay? - Really? Okay, fine. - Fine. - When? - How's tomorrow? - Fine. - There we go. Mayfield lot on sunset. 6:30 A.M. There. Now I've done my good deed for the day. It's been real. - Buh-bye. - So happy. mulligan the rabbit. and cut. All clear. - Yo, yo, yo, hold up. Kenny. Look, I brought a couple friends today. I want you to say hey. - You have friends? - Yes. Yes, I have friends, okay? And I want you to be especially nice to the little girl. - She's cute, but no can do, bunny buddy buddy. - No, no, wait. What do you mean "no can do"? - Got to get my tooth fixed. - Nah, it's good, guys. Guys, no, really, I'm fine. No, guys, it's cool. Wait, guys, no. Guys... - Just hold on. - It's fine. - Hold on. Get the zipper, man. I got you, man! Hold on! - Just let it be, all right? Hi. - Everything okay? We were just horsing around. You must be Taylor. - He knows my name. - I know. - Come over here. - Um, her vision's blurry. She's using her hands as a way to see. - You have big ears. Yuk, yuk, yuk. All the better to hear you with. - Well, it wouldn't be a visit to mulligan forest without a carrot. - Thank you so much for taking time with US, mulligan. - Can I make a wish in the wishing well? I think mulligan is super busy. No, she's absolutely right. Come on, Taylor. - Look at this. Okay, close your eyes, grab a magic pebble, and make a wish. And throw it in the rabbit hole. Come tell me what you made a wish for. I hope... I hope your wish comes true. I really do. Thank you. - Thanks, mulligan. - Bye, mommy. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey, Taylor. - Hi. - Hey there. - What are you doing here? I know. You came to make sure we showed up, didn't you? - Yes. No. I just... I wanted to make sure you guys got in okay. Well, we did. Thank you. But now my car won't start. Again. - It's called cash for clunkers. - Do you need a lift? - You're not gonna make me take the bus like I made you? - No, and I took a cab. Well, listen, i... i got a great mechanic. He could take a look. - Well, that's very nice of you. - Yeah. I guess it is. Well, my Mercedes with the broken taillight, it's over here. Okay. Thank you. Come on. - So how'd you like the show, Taylor? - Awesome. My birthday's coming up, and seeing mulligan was the best birthday present ever. Great. I hope mom wasn't too bored. - No, I kind of liked it too. - Really? - Well, not enough to get up at the crack of dawn, but he does have a way with kids. - You think? For sure. I mean, he has this much effect on mine, think about how many kids' lives he must touch every day. - Yeah, I guess I never thought of it like that. Right over here. - Here you go, baby. Let's get you out. Whee. Okay, well, thank you so much for everything today. - Yeah. - For the ride. Now I guess I owe you. - Well, I'm just glad it all worked out. - Yeah. You know, I have... It's a coupon for a free royal grande pancake. If you're ever in the neighborhood. - Thanks. - Now my crazy family and I will never bother you again. You want to say thank you? - Thank you, Eddie. Bye. - Bye, Taylor. - Bye. - See ya. Bye, guys. Hello? - Eddie, it's dick. What are you doing? You're gonna be late. You're gonna miss the biggest chance of your life. Do you know what time it is? Hi, Eddie. you're late, young man. - Do you know what time it is? - What? Who... no, what time is it? - It's party time, baby. What, you're just gonna sleep away Friday night? Yeah, I was, until you woke me up. - That's your problem, bro. You're asleep at the wheel. I'm trying to help you out here, man. 'Cause right now I'm the guy, and I think it would be really good for your career if you were seen in the public eye with the guy. Which is me. I mean, don't you watch entourage? - You know what, Scott? I'm really just fine. Thank you. Come on, bro. I mean, in a few weeks, I'm gonna be in Hawaii shooting a major motion picture with, like, naked chicks, and making a lot of money being, like, hot. And you're gonna be here by yourself, alone, on the couch, and sad, and I'll be out of your hair, so just think about it like a going-away party for me. Yeah? - All right. - Yes! Great. So you're gonna drive, right? - I can't even believe I let you drag me here, man. Come on, dude. You got to be seen on the scene, bro. Me and you, Batman and Robin. Cheech and Chong. Bert and Ernie, rit? So which one? - Which what? - Which one you want? I'm Bert. - No, dude, dude, the ladies, bro, the ladies. You know, I don't care, bro. - Sweet. Would you like to dance? Did I mention I'm the star of a major motion picture? Boom goes the dynamite. Ha. - Um, so... - So I was... Go ahead. So, Scott told me that you're the guy inside the mulligan the rabbit suit? - Scott told you that? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of a temporary thing. Actually, really focusing more on film right now. - Cool. Yeah, me too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Um, have you got anything coming out soon? - Right now? - Yeah. - No. You? - Um, yeah, I have a lot of stuff. Like, commercials, and... - Wow. - Yeah. I just saw my agent. I'm gonna go talk to him. Yeah. - Sure. Yeah. - He's even cuter in person. - Howdy. Howdy. I was just in the neighborhood. Figured I'd cash in my coupon. What brings you to this neck of the woods? I was just reminding myself why I don't go clubbing anymore. Yeah. I remember those days. So you're working late? - Yeah. I switched shifts so that I could bring Taylor to the show this morning. Who watches her while you're here? - My mom. - Where's her father? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. - He... he passed away. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Sorry. - One old grande pancakey coming up. - Wait, Annie. Do you have a second? - Here. Have a seat. - Okay. I was thinking, there's this roller rink not too far from my house, and I was supposed to bring Kenny, the kid from the mulligan show there tomorrow, and thought maybe Taylor would want to join US too, since she didn't get a chance to meet him. - Wow, that's so nice. Um, but I couldn't just let her come by herself. No, no, of course not. What I meant was you could come too. Of course, if you... if you want. Um, well, I could see if I could switch shifts again. - Yeah? - Yeah. What time were you thinking? Noon? - I'll check. - Yes. Go. - Yeah? - What are you, an alien? Most kids would love to go to a roller rink. - Hey, I'd love to, but my mother makes me take accordion lessons Saturday. She'd never let me go. - You take lessons all day? - No. Later I have tap dance. Then singing lessons. - Kenny. Who's at the door? - You better go. She owns a gun. - Just let me talk to her, okay? - It's your funeral. - What do you want? - I just wanted to run something by you. May I come in? - No. - Okay. You think Kenny should get a raise, right? - Well, personally, I think my Kenny should be getting paid more than you. - Right. Right. Well, that's probably not going to happen, but I could put in a good word with the producers if you're willing to help me out. I want to take Kenny to skate land. It's a roller rink. I'm bringing a family there today, and I'd like to take Kenny along too. - You want to take him now? - Hey, hey, hey, listen. They don't really know I'm mulligan, so let's just keep it that way, okay? - Why? - Because I'm a serious actor. It's embarrassing. - You have issues. - Listen, if they ask, just tell 'em I'm a friend of your mother's. - What's so funny? They'd never believe that. - Wait, wait, wait. They've never met her. They'll believe whatever you say. Look, I care about this family. I just don't want to screw it up. Okay? I don't know. My mother really wouldn't approve of me lying. - No. You're right. Lying... lying is bad. And I guess you won't mind when I tell them how you wet your pants during the show. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Actually, if we don't extend each other a little professional courtesy, who will? - That's what I thought. Let's go. - They're here. - Is Kenny with him? - He sure is. Hey, come on in. - Hey. - Would you mind filling this out, and I'll pick it up when we get back? - What is it? - A petition. My mom's been campaigning to get my star on Hollywood boulevard. - Hi. Kenny, this is Taylor. - Pleasure to make your acquaintance. - No kissing on the first date. - That's right. Good girl. - Are you ready to go? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Okay. - All right, let's do it. - Well, have fun, you guys. - Okay, bye. - Yeah, bye. Don't break anything. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye! - Hey, Kenny. - Whoa. - Here we go. Whoa. And wall. - I haven't done this in years. - Neither have I. It's kind of a workout? - Yeah. - Hi, guys. - Whoo. - Mommy, can we go play video games? - I'll take good care of her, Mrs. Benchley. - Please, mommy? - Okay, okay. But be careful. Just hold on to her, okay? Help her out, would you? Careful. - You ever been on a blind date before? No. - No way. Did you hear that? They're having fun? - Looks like they're having fun. - Yeah. And what about you? - Me? - Are you having fun? - Yes, I am. - Yes? - Yeah, I guess I am. - Good. We're on roller skates. Hey, let me... let me ask you a question. A personal question. - Okay, as long as it doesn't include anything about my driving record. - No, you have answered all questions about driving. But maybe let's go sit down. - Okay. - I'm gonna fall down. - Okay. Come on. Okay, so what do you want to know? - All right, what's it like? - What? - You know, I see how much you love Taylor. I've never, you know, had that with anyone, so what's it like? - Truth? - No, please, just straight up lie to me. - It's scary, I guess. I just... it feels so good, I would never want to lose it again. - Again? - I married my high school sweetheart and then lost him to leukemia three years after Taylor was born. - Wow. I'm sorry. - Yeah. Taylor was... Pretty much all I had to get me through that. And I promised myself I would never let anything happen to her. And then I found out that she has a degenerative eye disease. - How... how bad is it? - She's not totally blind yet. She can still see bright colors and shapes and shadows. That's probably why she loves that mulligan show so much. But her world will get darker and darker until one day the door will just shut. Doctors give her a year until that happens. - There's... there's nothing they can do? - Believe me, I've researched everything. I practically live on Google. I even found this one operation that has worked in cases like hers, but it's crazy expensive, and I can't afford it. Even with the operation, there's no guarantee that it would work. - Wow. Well, there's nothing wrong with a little hope now and then, right? What? - Nothing. - No, no, no, don't do that. What? - I was just thinking, for a jerk, you're not such a total jerk. - Thank you. I think. No, I've got to work up to total jerk. I'll get there. I lost my cool with you a couple of times. I'm sorry. I feel like we got off to a bad start. Maybe we can have a do-over? - Okay. I'm Annie benchley. - Pleasure. Eddie avedon. Yo, Eddie, I left something in your mailbox for you. - Yeah, what is it? - A present. - Thank you. - So what do you think, Graham? - We'll, you've done a lot to help our organization in the past, Eddie, so I really want to help out on this. - Thank you. - If she's a candidate, I'll do whatever I can to help push it through the board. - And then she'd have the operation? - Well, helping children in need is what our organization's all about, right? - Great. Great. - Miracles can happen. So you just make sure that you get the doctor's evaluation as soon as possible, and then we go from there. - Graham, I think you just made a little girl's day. - You see that? This is a good one, right? And it smells good. Smell it. Smell it. I like it. Yeah, come here. Hey. - Hey. - Eddie! - Everything, okay? - Actually, more than okay. Hey, Taylor. What's up, buddy? Guess what. - What? - I have some news for you and a present. - Really? For me? What is it? - Well, it's not something you can open. I went to the it's a miracle foundation today, and they told me as long as you're a candidate, they can do your eye surgery. Cool? Eddie, can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. - Cut some more roses, baby. Why would you do that without my permission? - Well, I thought you'd be happy. - You can't just come over here and promise her stuff like that. - Well, I'm not promising her anything, but it's an opportunity, and I think... - But you didn't think. That's the problem. Do you have any idea what you've done? What if it doesn't work? - Well, she deserves a chance, right? I mean, she's got nothing to lose. And what's the alternative? To not try? Hey, what if it works? - Okay. - Mommy, can Eddie come on Saturday? - What's on Saturday? - We're having a little party for Taylor in the backyard. - A party? Wow. - We'd love it if you'd come. - You know what? I would love to. How can I turn down that invitation? Kenny. What was that? - Stairway to heaven. - Of course it was. Look, I just want to thank you for being so great with Taylor. - You kidding? Thanks for the hookup. She even invited me to her birthday party. I told them I'd bring mulligan. - Wait, Kenny, I can't be Eddie and be mulligan at the same time. I... great. Now I can't go. Perfect. - Why? At the end of the party you can be like, "ta-da," and break out of your costume. - What, like, ta-da, like I'm coming out of a giant cake? No. I'm in a bunny suit. Help me out. - Chill out. Show up at the party as mulligan, cut out early, and come back as Eddie. - Yeah. Yeah, I... I guess you're right. I could do that. Adults make life so complicated. - Kenny, just remember our professional courtesy. Nobody knows I'm mulligan, right? - Got it. It's like a Superman, Clark Kent thing. Except you're a bunny. - Great. Thanks. - You know you want to go talk to him, so go talk. - Um, look, I just wanted to say I was sorry that I kind of freaked out on you before. Thank you for setting this whole thing up. Even if she's not a candidate. I don't know how I could ever repay you. - Got any more pancake coupons? - Yes. Hey, baby! - Mr. and Mrs. Benchley? No, no, we're not marr... I mean, I'm her mother. I'm just a good friend. The data regarding her optic nerve hypoplasia looks promising. I'm going to give a recommendation to the foundation that we move forward. - So the operation could work? - Well, I've had success with some similar cases. - Is it gonna hurt? No, Taylor, it won't hurt at all. That just means they put you to sleep. They sprinkle some magic fairy dust on you so when you wake up, hopefully you'll be able to see better again. - Wicked. - Congratulations. - Thank you very much, doctor. This is great. - Ew. - Yeah. Yeah, no, I think the movie's got impact. I just think it would have, like, more impact if, like, my character didn't die, you know? I'm just... 'cause I'm thinking, I'm thinking, like, sequels, I'm thinking franchise, right? - Seven. - Right. Yeah, okay. Yeah. All right. Hey, it's, like, a party. - Scott, hey. This is Annie and Taylor. - The Fender bender. Yeah, my boy Eddie can't stop talking about you guys. - You're hot Scott. I heard you on TV. That's, that's what they call me now. Call me hot Scott. It's kind of cool. - How's rehearsals going? Dude, they're good, but i'm... I'm trying to make it better, and they just keep fighting me on, like, everything. It's just... it's hard, man. It's hard. - Do you want to join US? - Yeah. - No. - I would, but I got to rewrite my lines, you know? Life of an actor. - Got it. - Yeah. - He's fun. - All r... did you... Did you... You moved when I wasn't looking. Did you just see that? Did you... You're cheating. What are you... Did you teach her this? You are... - Yes. - The board has reviewed the doctor's recommendation. - And? - They've accepted Taylor's case. - Yes! That's fantastic. Graham, thank you, thank you. So when can she have the operation? - Well, doing this as long as I have, I really guess between three and five years. - Years? I don't understand. Why so long? She doesn't have that kind of time. Maybe a year tops. - Eddie, most of our funds go to children with life-threatening cases. Some of those kids might not even be here in a year. - I understand, just... Taylor's eyesight is a ticking clock. What if this window closes for good? - I'm not gonna lie to you. That is a possibility. But it doesn't make it a life-threatening case. - So? - Well? - Well, they have accepted Taylor's case. - So great. Give me a hug. Thank you. Okay, so when? - Well, that's... that's what we have to discuss. They said, um... Well, it could take a few... W-Weeks. - Weeks? That's it? That's so soon. Did you hear that? - I guess that's why they call it "it's a miracle." - Yes, it is. My gosh. - Yes. Miracles can happen. - Okay, so what is so incredibly important that I couldn't finish my haircut? Adam? - I need money. - We all need money, Eddie. Can't get a decent haircut in this town without a price. - No, you don't understand. I need a lot of money. You do my investments. How much money do I have? - All right, how much do you need? - 400,000? - 400,000? What kind of trouble have you gotten yourself into now? - Never mind. I just need it. I mean, come on. You can't walk down the street without seeing mulligan stuff everywhere, right? - I hate to break this to you, kid, but you don't own any of that. - What do you mean? - Remember what you said during negotiations? "I'm broke. Just book the job." I kept saying, "Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, mulligan carrots alone are gonna be worth a small fortune." You just wanted me to close the deal, so I did. You never got a piece. Maybe now you'll finally listen to me. - Okay. Okay. Um, well, how much money do I have? - $47,628.13. - That... that's it? No, no, that can't... That can't be right. - Well, you have 300k in equity in your house which I could probably pull out if you refi, which gives you a total of $347,628. - And 13 cents. - You want to tell me what this is all about, Eddie? - This is about me trying to find happiness in something other than my career. For once. - So she is having a baby. - Thanks. - All right, good to see you. - "Added to the waiting list. Three to five year wait." Annie! He lied to US. - Why would he lie? There must be a mix-up. - No, there's no mix-up. The letter said exactly "three to five year wait." - Well, have you tried calling Eddie? - Yeah, he's not answering. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. - I know what I'm gonna do when he gets here. - Mom, listen to me. I don't want to deal with this, okay? This is Taylor's day. I don't want to ruin it. So please. - Guess this would be a bad time to tell her I invited Jeffrey. - Probably. - Hey, Chris. - Hey. Why are you here on Saturday? I came to get mulligan for a birthday party. - Well, that'll be a problem. We get it sent out to get cleaned on the weekends, and the guy just left. - Well, is there anything else? Backup? - The old one from the first season. - Great. Great. - Signing autographs. - Next. All righty. Next. Next. Next. - Hi. - Aah! Wait a minute. we're happy! - Jeffrey's a great clown. The kids really love him. It's a party now, kids, yeah? Here we go. Look at this. Whoa! Hey, kids, mulligan the rabbit's here. I think. - Hello, everybody! - That's just some guy in a crummy old rabbit suit. - Yeah. - It looks like a rat. No! Yes, I know what time it is. - You know, honey, I don't think that's the real mulligan. - Mommy, I know his voice. It is. - Hey, kids, look. Four balls? good! - Hey, who wants to make balloon animals? Come on around. Look at this. There you go. Very delicate. - I'm mulligan! - All right, kids! Come join the conga line! - Yeah, we know it's time for the rabbit to go back into his hole. - Hey. - What are you trying to do? - I'm trying to save their hearing, all right? - Well, why don't you try to stop singing, then? What do you think you're doing? That's my nose! - I got ten bucks and a candy bar on the clown. - Okay, no. No fighting. No. You guys, no fighting. This is a kid's party. Come on. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. No! Aah! - Aah! - You! - Eddie? Okay, I want you to leave right now. - No, no, just let me explain, all right? Kenny, Kenny, go ahead, tell them. - He's definitely not mulligan. - No. No, no, no, no. Forget everything I told you. Tell them I'm mulligan. - He's definitely mulligan. - See? - You know what? No more lies, Eddie. You've done enough to ruin my family already. I know. I got a letter from it's a miracle. - Yeah, and it's a miracle that I don't jump in there and wring that soggy bunny neck. - Come on, kids. The party's moving inside. Minus one guest. - No, mommy... - Ta-da. Yeah, thanks, buddy. - What you doing, bro? Are you still messed up over Annie? - It's not just Annie. It's Taylor too. I... I let 'em both down. - Hey, well, if misery loves company, then I'm your soul mate. I just got fired. - What? Why? - I don't know. He said that I couldn't act or... whatever. Stuff. - Aw, man. I'm sorry. Don't bother yourself. I'll... I'll get it. Coming. - Where have you been? I've been trying to call you. Yeah, and your manager called. - Do you want to sit down? - No, there's no time. Look, Blake levans fired that airhead, and he's desperate to cast this thing tonight. I am personally gonna drive you over there to make sure nothing happens to you this time. - No can do, dick. - Stop messing with me, Eddie. You're gonna make me break out in cold sores. - Hey, bro, the airhead says go for it. I mean, come on, if you get the job, then I get to crash on your couch in Hawaii, right? - Well, are you going or not? - Thanks, man. - Do better than me. - All right. - Act good. Hawaii. Boom goes the dynamite. - All right, I'm gonna go talk to mommy for a second. I'm gonna be right back, okay? - Okay. - You know, she's handling it pretty well. I mean, someone, you know, dangles vision in front of her and then rips it away... You'd think she'd be more upset. - Well, I think she's more upset that Eddie's not around. - What about you? - What about me? - I saw the way you looked at him. You can't hide things from me. I'm your mother. - Okay, he grew on me. What do you care? You said you hated him. - Well, yeah, I didn't like that he, you know, what he did, and that he lied, but I like that he's gotten my daughter out of her shell. And I like that he's put a smile on my granddaughter's face. And, all things considered, I... Well, he tried to help. - Yeah. - What does your heart say? - It says forget about him. - Good. Then do the opposite. Your heart can't be trusted. It's been broken. What does your gut say? Your gut is stronger than your heart. It keeps you moving forward. You know, in time your heart is gonna heal, and then you can listen to it again, but... but until then, trust your gut. - It says I should call him. - In other celebrity news... - My gosh. My gosh. It's Eddie. It's Eddie. - Where's Eddie? - Look. - Look, can you see? - Well, I just feel honored that the Blake levans cast me. And I look forward to working alongside Jillian beaudry. Very talented and beautiful actress. Jillian beaudry? - And we're gonna be shooting in Hawaii, so there you go. Perfect. - Shooting is scheduled to start this week in Hawaii. Aloha, Eddie. Call him. - No, I am not gonna call him. He's getting ready to go do a movie with Jillian beaudry. It just wasn't meant to be. - Call him, mommy. - Hello. - Yes, it's Graham Bennett from the it's a miracle foundation. I have some very good news for you, Mrs. Benchley. We had a surgical cancellation, and after doing some pushing, I was able to move Taylor's date up. - To when? - Actually, this Tuesday. - So soon? Are you sure? - I'm positive. You still want the procedure, right? - Yes. No, of course. Yes, thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Bennett. - My pleasure. - Thanks. - That was good news. She's finally asleep. That coffee is gonna keep you up all night. - If it doesn't, worrying about the operation will. - Or thinking about Eddie. Mom, please. - Look, I know I promised not to bring him up again. - When has that ever stopped you? - But I think you should call him and tell him about the surgery. You owe him at least that much. - Well, you're right about that. - No, no, no, no. Defense, defense. No, no, no! Come on! - What are you doing, stupid? Hello. - Hello? Hi. Is Eddie there? - Not... not that I know of. - Okay. Um, will you just tell him that Annie called? - Yeah, I'll tell him. - Thanks. - Did the phone ring? - And he's got an opening. He shoots and scores. - Yeah! Yeah! Critter walk. Critter walk. Critter walk. Go critters. Go critters. - Please fasten your seatbelts and place your seats in the upright and locked position as we make our descent to the big island. Aloha. - Here we go. - Baby, they said it was gonna be a long operation. - Yeah, I know. I know. - She's gonna be okay. Either way. Really. I mean, she's... she's strong. Just like her mother. - Yeah. - I'm gonna get a refill. Do you want something? - No. - Are you sure? No water? Nothing? Okay. - Hello? Hello? - Quick trip. - Yeah. How... how is she? Taylor's not out yet. Well, if you're talking about the other she, she's a nervous wreck. You know, she could really use you. - Yeah? Thanks. - You know, I talked to that Mr. Bennett. I mean, I had to work on him, but... You paid for the surgery. - Does Annie know? - No. No, I figure if you want her to know, you have to tell her. - I'll tell you what, let's... Let's keep that our little secret. - What are you doing here? - I wanted to make sure Taylor got her wish. - What if the operation doesn't work? - Annie, she didn't wish for her eyesight. She wished for her mother to be happy again. I am really... - Okay. - Is that what a Mercedes benz looks like? - No, this one's even better. - What happened to your car? I sold it. I wanted more of a family car. All right, kiddo. You ready to go? All right, let's do it. - Wait, is that... It can't be. - Why not? - Look, honey. - I guess miracles can happen. - Yeah, baby. - Come on, honey. Five more minutes. - Ten more... Ten more minutes. - Wishful thinking. - Hey! How's a baby? Mommy, the baby's awake. - Hi. Ooh. - Scooch over. - Hey there. Good morning. - Scoochie. Aw. - Look who I found. Hey. Yes. No. - Daddy was better. Yes, he was. - yeah, she doesn't like him either. - She agrees. - Ouch, my tooth. - Where's the carrot? Where's my carrot? Where's the carrot? Guys, where's the... And get me out of this. Come on, it's hot. I can smell my lunch in here. Gross. - Kenny. Get him a star on the walk of fame. - I'm breathing my own air. And my armpits are so gross. The carrot. That was my carrot. That's my thing. - Man up, bro. Stop being such a crybaby. You're even worse than Eddie. - How about you put on the bunny suit and try acting? Just... try acting. - Just give me your name. Just write it right here. All you got to do is sign it. That's all you got to do. Love you. This is... this is for Kenny. Yes. Kenny, the candy monster. Hey, um, I broke another tooth. You're gonna be a toothless bum by the time you're 13! Better have your own show by them. - Now daddy gets to go to sleep some more. Tickle him. Tickle him. - Tickle him. Tickle him. - No! No!
