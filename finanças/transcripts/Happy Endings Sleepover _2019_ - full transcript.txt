Sit! So, what now? As they used to say, the war for you, my friend, is over. Cigarette? No. There was Sander Lars Hansen, and there was me, I'm Johnnie Allen, More about Sander later, I'm an American, born in Tacoma, Washington, who just got a job with, get this, the C,I,A. Yeah, that C,I,A, I've been posted to the tiny little kingdom of Denmark and it's my first day here, I'm no stranger to small countries, by the way, My idiot parents raised me from the time I was a baby in a religious cult in a failed South American stronghold, I never saw the good ol' U-S-of-A until I was 14, Talk about culture shock! Add to that my funny accent from Curaçao, and you can imagine my high school social standing, Not fun! Not only do I work for the C,I,A,, but I'm gay, And they don't like it when you're gay and work there, Which I never understood! Because if you ever want to know everything about anything, just ask your local gay guy, And if my bible-thumping mother ever found out, she'd hate me and just tell me to burn in hell, So, we'll keep that on the down-low, Sorry? Oh, you're closed? - Yeah, we're closed, -Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I don't speak Danish, English, of course, Welcome to The Grand, How can I help you? I just need a room for one night, Just one single room for only you? That's right, Just me, Reservation? No,,, And your name, please? Johnnie Allen, Would you please spell it for me? Yeah, It's J-o-h-n-n-i-e, A-l-l-e-n, Looks like I made it, I'm in Denmark, Walking the cobblestone streets of this beautiful Danish town led me through places that looked like they were taken from Disney World, It's weird to see a building that was erected about the same time that the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth rock, It's even stranger to see a McDonald's in a building that's older than that! The world turned out to be a little bigger than I expected, And I felt lost, I've never been as lonely, either, I can count on one finger the times I've had a one-night stand, But I guess some things cross all language barriers, And "gay need" spoke the loudest, Not my best moment, Especially the morning after, Sorry, I don't actually speak any Danish yet, Oh, that's not a problem, Then we'll do some English, Please have a seat, So, You need a flat, yes? Yeah! Someone at the hotel told me about you, Oh! It's my daughter's friend, I knew you were coming! So, I handle a very nice place, not far from here, And the woman who runs the place takes great care of everyone, One moment, please, When you get to the place, just ask for Emma, Emma? Yeah? Sorry, do you speak English? Uh,,, Emma said she knows who you are because Maria's mom already called her, She wanna know when you wants to move in, Are you moving in? Oh, yeah, I'm from America and I'm going to school here-- --Don't they have schools in America? Anyway, Would you let her know that I would like to move in, and I would like to take the place as soon as I can, Yeah, Yes! Today! : My new flat was not only furnished, courtesy of Emma's basement, but it came complete with friends my age who didn't mind helping me move in, Even Emil, who was still nursing a hangover, supervised from my couch, And then there was Emma, who was more grandmother than landlord, I never imagined that my first place on my own would be on the other side of the world, Or that where I would wind up would change my life forever, The fact is, I was home, Just a minute! : So, - for me! Dang! I was totally floored! Since Saturday was less than a week away, and I didn't want to come to the party empty-handed, it was time for a beer and soda run, And my first experience with my new neighbor, Bent Gundersen, manager of Boop's Boutique Supermarket, I say "manager" but that's up for debate! Hey! Whoa! Johnnie Allen! You must like beer! We have the A,A, over here too, Just like in your States! Screw you, Bent! Is all for the party on Saturday? Yeah, Thought I'd help, At least with some of it, Oh! Never had a party thrown for me before, you know? No, no, no, no! We pay it, for your party! Uhm, what if I pay for it and you just bring it? How about that? Hmmm,,, yeah! Yo! It's good, But,,, shhh,,, alright? Of course, So, uhm, how much? Hmmm,,, Two-thousand kroner, please, It's a Bent Gundersen discount, Okay, John, Right? It's Johnnie, actually, Ms, Stupelmann, Johnnie, You can call me Marge, We'll get along just famously, I'm sure, Sounds good, We have lots for you to do, But first, I wanna know you a little bit better, Yeah, Sure, You're queer, I've never run a queer before, Would that be a problem? What? Now you're deaf? Relax, already, Why do you think we picked you? We picked you because you're queer, Can you stop that, please?! What? I hate that word! What? Deaf? No! Queer! I hate it! Should I be all antiseptic? And call you a "practicing homosexual?" So, what, I'm fired now, right?! I'm 21, I can be a queer if I want to be! So, kill me! I'm just here to do the job! That's the problem with our kind! We're always so damned dramatic! What? Wait-- --You don't think I'd waste all this classic charm and beauty on some guy who grunts and ickkk! Wow! You're a trip, lady! Yeah, yeah, yeah, There's "official," And then there's official, if you know what I mean, : I knew exactly what she meant! There's nothing more undercover than a closeted gay guy, But I guess I'd passed the test, Because Marge called Langley and put me on the duty roster, Now all I had to do was go home and wait for my first assignment, : This is the police! Come out, American! You're surrounded! Shut up! Come in, asshole, So,,, What are we having? Eggs and bacon, And toast and jelly, I bet it's gooood! It's so good! You won't believe how good it is! Yeah? It looks like it, So, How do you like your eggs? I don't know, Cook them, Maybe like yours, Alright! One Emil Special coming right up! You know, this is really good food you make, Thanks! Anyone ever say that to you? I cook all the time for my little brother and sister, They love it when I do, I see why, You miss your family? I do, Well, We'll be your family, You'll even be sick of us, Just like the real ones, And you're already big news around here, My brother told his mates about the party, and all is good people here, You'll like us, Yeah, I've never felt so welcome before, And listen to this! Bent bought six cases of beer for your party! Six cases! We couldn't believe him when he told us, Because he's so cheap, We call him Uncle Joakim, Who's Uncle Joakim? Oh, yeah, You guys call him Scrooge McDuck, You know, Donald Duck's uncle? What's tight with the money? Me and Elizabeth will go to the party when she get back from her job, Who's Elizabeth? That's my girl! Elizabeth, he says! Of course, he's not gay, I always zero in on the straight cases that I can never have, Story of my gay-ass life! : Okay, you are crazy! This is-this is not me! This is your brother, who comes here in his Mercedes, two, three times a day! And he takes your money! Not me! This is the last time! Next time you are on my list of shit! Accuse me one more time, and you will be on my bigger list of shit! Aaaggghhh! I'm watching you! You see?! That's the problem you make me! This will be paid on money I paid you! Oh, yeah, because that is my fault too! Ass! Hey! Johnnie! Johnnie! Johnnie Americani! Take a beer man! It's on me! Hey, hey! Everybody! Everybody! Johnnie speaked Danish! Not really, Hi, You're a little wet, Is it raining orange soda pop outside? I think Bent's right, You're nuts, Emil! Bring me a Sprite or a 7-up! Fuck you! You ever want breakfast again? We gotta get that orange stuff out of your shirt or it will never go away, No hot dogs tonight? What? The grill kiosk, No hot dogs, I saw you there before, Well, I quit them, So that means no more hot dogs ever again, That's why I said, "No more of this anymore!" And I disappeared, Into the air! You speak English, I do a bit, yeah, Cool, What's your name? Fuck you still, Johnnie, Do you mind? No! Yeah! Do that man, thank you, Guess you'll take it from here, Okay, We don't want people to talk shit about us, right? Yeah, Don't take no shit, Sander, Thanks for the help, Johnnie Allen, You know my name, Yeah, Everybody here does, You know, I wasn't planning to come here tonight, But there was going to be an American guy here, That's you!

If that kiss was the example, then, yeah,,, I love you like you love me, Yes! Ahhh! Yeah! Yeah, This looks nice, Look, One bed again, I love you so much, Johnnie Allen, I don't wanna cum too fast, What do you wanna do? I'm gonna make you a good massage for a time, Sure! Where do you want me, then? That's awesome! Oh, Johnnie! Whoa! Where did you,,, I was going to suck your dick, but I think you got a bigger surprise instead! Now I don't feel so bad, Wow, man! You came and nobody even touch it! That's what you call love from the inside out, huh? I haven't even seen that in pornos before! You know what? You are just such a beautiful man, You are so kind to me, and I just want you to know that, Okay? Wow! Dang! Are you looking at my ass? Morning! And what if I am? Just checking, I was hoping that you were, Now I'm looking at your dick, Oh, I see, Now I'm touching your dick, I like how it looks, That's good, I think, It will be bad if you don't, No, I mean I like how it's the whole thing, Some asshole doctor didn't slice up yours when you were a baby, We don't do shit like that over here, We do where I'm from, It totally sucks, Look! I'm making a little place out of my hand for it to hide, Kind of like a little dog house for your hot dog, Did you know that my big sister got a big crush on you, No way! Yeah, But, uh,,, That's her bad luck because you are all mine, And Jannik thinks that I'm Luke Skywalker, Why? He thinks that I can do anything, My mama says that I'm his helten, I think "hero" is the word, Yeah, hero, I know what he sees in you, Smart kid, How'd you tell them,,, that you're- Sometimes I don't know what to do with you, Johnnie Allen, Sorry, But I will tell you, Of course, I always kind of knew that I mostly like boys, Mostly? Go on,,, I fell for a boy called Torben, We had sex, But, one day he moved to Copenhagen, And I got really sad, And my mom asked me why I got so sad, Yeah? So, she hugs me and kisses me, and tells me that she understands everything, And that every boy gets a crush on a boy sometimes, But maybe one day I will like girls too, What happened then? Is this a pussy? Fuck off! Exactly, So here we are, I miss our car, This waiting on a train thing sucks, Yeah, man,,, It SUCKS! How will you tell them? About us, I mean, I show you, Gimme your phone, ,,,You make them, Of course, Hi, Johnnie, How are you two boys doing today? We're good, Mama, Actually, we got, a-- We got news for you, too, Me and Johnnie are together, Yes, I know that, You're in Copenhagen, Yes? Not like that, You know how to do it, No, I mean, yeah, we went to,,, We went to Copenhagen-- --first the mustard, then the ketchup, and then the onions, And put more doggies on the grill, What I meant was, me and Johnnie is together, Ah! You're boyfriends, then! This is very good news, Pokey! Oh, congratulations, I'm so happy for you both, You have a wonderful man! Thanks, uh,,, I love your son very much, Oh, I know you do, And Sander loves you, too, Everyone will be so happy, Maybe not Ingrid, When do you boys come back from Copenhagen? Yeah, uh, we will be back on Tuesday, uh- But right now, we are in,,, We are in Dusseldorf, changing trains to Belgien, Is it your honeymoon trip? Because I can think of better places-- --Yak yak yak yak! Phone phone phone! Help me! I was off an hour ago! Honeymoon in Belgien! So, you can bring me some chocolate! No, no, no it's for-- it's for Johnnie's work! But I will bring you the chocolate, Okay, well, be safe, See you soon, Tuesday, okay? Bye! And that, dear Johnnie, is how us Hansen's deal with it, Live and learn, my boy! Live and learn! How come she calls you, Pokey, Pokey? Yeah, that's a story, isn't it? I'm waiting, And let us save that story for our 25-year anniversary, okay? Okay, Yes, of course it's me, Stop being an idiot, Listen, this mission,,, We have to abort now, They're on to me, Yeah, Small mishap, The fucking homo shot me, In the foot! What does it matter?! No! I need to get moving, I'm at the Antwerp station, I'm trying to fix a train from here, I'm serious! Why does your mom call you Pokey? I'm curious, man, Yeah, I know you are, But I won't tell you! You know what? I'll tell you, Sander! Sander?! AAAGGGHHH! Fuck! What happened? Yeah, Yeah, Don't go! Marge! Please come! He shot--he shot him, Marge! I'm at the station! Just come, Marge! Russian subject! Drop your weapon! Drop it now! And why should I do that? Because if you don't, I'm gonna kill ya! Why should I be afraid of you? This doesn't have to end bad! Drop it now! Drop it! Stop being an idiot! It's over for you! You are new to this, aren't you? Now here's what's gonna happen! I am going to leave now,,, And you're not gonna stop me! Or I will kill the lady! And then I will kill you! How about that?! Not gonna happen! Drop your weapon! Toss the gun on the ground! Now! No, Johnnie, look out! Johnnie?! : Marge visited with us for most of the day and confirmed that the fake did, indeed, try and kill us, I'd like to say that I took the high road, and that I felt bad for shooting him, I didn't feel bad, Because just an inch or two either way, and Sander could be in the morgue right now instead of here with me, Where's Johnnie? I'm good, Thanks, Hi, Pokey, I'm so sorry, I'm so very, very sorry, It's a good thing that that man is not much of a good shot, huh? : Marge told me that the Russian bastard survived, And thankfully, because of some reason known only to her, so did my career as a Transport Specialist for the C,I,A, Not that I deserved it at all, All good? Yeah, She's just happy that I'm here, And not in the grave, I am, too, by the way, Johnnie? Can we talk about your family? Your mom and dad, and perhaps when I can meet them? Yeah, well,,, What? My mom's a Bible thumper, To her, you and me should burn in hell forever and ever, And I don't want her to ruin what we have, Don't she want you to be happy? To be with someone who loves you? You'd think so, But she likes Jesus, And thinks gays should burn in hell, Real smart stuff, right? Anyway, I'm happily half way around the world from her and her shitty husband, - And I don't need to-- -Maybe I need that, Johnnie, you said it yourself,,, You're half way around the world, Okay? You are away from them, Maybe, what I need-- --No, you don't! So what? You just want to hide me in the basement? Like I'm not real? Ain't you happy about yourself, Johnnie? Do you wish you wasn't-- --I'm very happy with who I am and who I'm becoming, Pokey, Come on, Plane's boarding, I promised myself no more hiding, Why let her say mean things to you or to me? That she can't take back? What! Sander, what the hell?! We won't work together, Sander! It won't work, For too many reasons, So, I think you should just sit here,,, And then I will be sitting over there, Come on, Planes ain't gonna wait, Please sit, Okay, I always want to be fair with you, Because I love you so much, So here it comes, I am not a good person, And I'm not the man you think I am, You're not my first boyfriend, You know that, right? Yeah, Torben, right? I told you that when we broke up, it wasn't a big deal at the time, But it was a very big deal! Hey! Do you still love him? I mean, it's okay, I'll stick around until you tell me not to, Just stop it, Sander! He was so afraid that our classmates would think there was something between us, Just like you are afraid that your mom will know, And then one day after school, my world just gets destroyed, I feel like a bad person because Jannik saw what happened, I was so mean to him, He saved your life, You don't wish to be with me, Johnnie, Melanie Martinez! We cut and kill flowers because we think they're beautiful,,, We cut and kill ourselves because we think we're not, Melanie Martinez, She wrote it, You're such a stupid American, So, you won't forgive yourself! What kind of shit is that?! Dude! You gotta get past it! We gotta get past it! Except I almost killed myself because I'm,,, Because I'm me, Okay? I mean, you don't even want to show me to your mom, So, where does that leave us? What if we start over from the very first? I do love you, You know that, right? Yeah, Same here, And I don't care who knows it, Not even your mom? No, I'll never leave you, I don't know, Maybe you should find a Norwegian instead, Dumb Dane, I just might do that! I can actually kind of picture you with a Norwegian now, Yurta hurta fluckity flurta! Come-a-sucka-me-tiny Norwegian dick! Asshole! Come on, Still got that joint on ya? Bet we can get a light from that cop over there, Yeah, you got problems, man! That's why you love me, Maybe, "It's me, Looks like I made it," "I'm in Denmark," "He's beautiful, But I know I can never have him," "Got my assignment today, But I can't even look at it 'til the day of it," "So, I guess I'll ju -" You want me to stop? No, "We steer our lives onto roads where they don't belong, craving some kind of validation," "We're fragile, Now I'm stronger than I've ever been," "It's because of a man who loves me and takes me for who and for what I am," Are you looking at my ass? Okay, you can look a little, "I've been given a gift in Sander Lars Hansen," "He's the final piece to the very strange puzzle known as Johnnie Paul Allen," "And about Sander Lars Hansen,,," "Will we make it together? I think so, I really do," "And don't get me wrong, I'm happy to be me," "But I'm much happier to be,,," "Us," Do you like that, Johnnie Allen?
