This way to Santa Cruz! You may alight the boat now. Boss! How much are these? Drop me off at the church first then take my things home. Okay, boss. Go through the church to reach the office. Okay. For you, five pesos only. Thank you. During the Spanish occupation, there was a drought here in Buendia. Despite the novenas held every day, the rain refused to fall. Because of the people's lack of faith, they threw the image of the Virgin Mary into the river. It rained for days, causing the river to overflow. A new image of the Virgin Mary was built, and the people started to repent. And that's when the rain stopped. From then on, their devotion to the Blessed Virgin grew strong. Ilyong, take Al to the cemetery.. He's going to visit his mother's grave. - See you soon, Al. - See you soon. So Al, you came from Saudi Arabia? Yes. You must be very rich now. Is it true that there are no women there? - What? - Is it true that there are no women there? - Yes. - Turn the motor off for a while. - What? - Turn that off. Do you hear anything? Hear what? They say that if you listen closely, you will hear the fairies singing. But after that, you'll die. Start the motor. Let's go. I think the rebels are responsible for that. A lot of their encounters with the soldiers happen at this site. In fact, just last night, there was an encounter in this river. I remember you. You were the kid who liked ice pops. Are you married? No. You better hurry. Before you know it, you're already a dried-up man. How about you? Where's your family? Family? I'm not married. It's too bad you missed your mother's funeral. She was such a kind woman. She never talked about anything except you. Business used to be good. But now we're not making much profit. I'm thinking of selling this ice plant. Good idea. The price of oil is killing us. A liter costs 3.25 pesos. And almost all houses have their own fridge. If you want, we can find a buyer. Last year, we sold at least 200 ice blocks per day. But now, we only sell as much as 96 ice blocks a day. - If this plant closes, what will happen to you? - It's not a problem. I can get another job. I can work as a mechanic or even an electrician. I even have a job offer as a repairman in a telephone company. It just opened recently and it offers a high salary. I just stayed here because of your mother's request. - Yeah. - Will you be staying here for long? About a month. If you want, you can take me with you back to Saudi. - What about the telephone company? - I know, but working abroad is a better idea. You'd have a status quo. - It's not status quo, it's status symbol! - It's just the same. So, can I come with you? But I just met you. You know, your mother had high standards in hiring employees here in the ice plant. And I was the one she trusted the most, even if I wasn't from this place. Boss, that beer garden looks like it's out of business, right? But when the clock strikes 4, it comes back to life. How much did you pay for that? - This one? - Yeah. - Five pesos. - You've been duped. It only costs three pesos, even less. A lot has changed since you left. That's the office of the telephone company. And this cultural center is now the office of family planning. Cristy works there. I heard she's your childhood friend, she came from Manila. Boss, she's really sexy. Let's go ask her for some condoms. The acceptance rate for the past year increased by just 11%. We can do better than that. We need to work on our motivation techniques for prospective users. We recently checked the records of the BSPO. The distribution went well. In fact, we almost ran out of comics so I had to order more. - How many kids do you have. - Miss, some comics? There she is. What's the BPO's recommendation about your IEC? The IGP will be coordinating with the FUC. And it's up to us, FTAO, to implement it since the PPO has been approved. Is the training of FTAO ongoing? Or does it need the supervision of FST? Hi. Hi! Remember me? I'm AK. Al Katigbak. - And you're CN, Cristy Nieto, right? - Yeah. - She's NS, Nellie Solis. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm an AL to her. "Always a Loser." Of course I remember you, Al. So you speak Tagalog too? I thought they only speak in acronyms like PLDT, KKK, NMPC, PBA. Oh, my day's already ruined! I was three batches ahead of you in SMBHS. St. Mary's of Buendia High School, right? Yeah. I remember seeing you during MWF and TTH as well. Oh, so you're both BBs? Back in Buendia? Very funny! When did you come back? You went to Saudi, right? Yeah, for the money of course. How about you? What are you doing here? I work at POPCOM. I'm part of the field support team, that's why I supervise provincial areas from time to time. Actually, it's been a long time since I last came here. So you're still in public service. Not really. But I'm still socially committed. It's good to have something to believe in, right? As for me, I believe in the concept of brain drain, in Filipinos for export. It reduces the population! Come with me. I need an engineer's help. I can't carry these alone. Just place it here. Okay. - How about you, Ms. Solis? What do you believe in? - I believe that I'm standing in front of the original brain drain! Cut me some slack. We're here to seek the government's help. We'd like to ask for some condoms. It's my nephew's birthday so maybe we could turn those condoms into balloons and blow them up. Why don't you blow up your own head?! By the way Father, Al's mother wasn't that religious. Back in the day, I hardly saw her at church. Come on, Ma. Going to church regularly doesn't make a person religious. That's true. There are many ways to serve God. Each person has his or her own way. Even those who hurt others and cause trouble have their own kind of devotion. I don't think that's true, Father. Whenever I see a butterfly, I remember my sister Rosa. Rosa? Oh, Al. My mother's very superstitious. Eat some more. Father, have I told you about my sister Rosa who ended up becoming a monk? She was my only sibling. We rarely saw each other since she was staying in Manila. Now one day, I was knitting right at this very spot. Suddenly, it felt like someone was beside me. I got goosebumps all over my body. Then a butterfly came flying around. I don't know why but I suddenly uttered "Rosa?" Would you believe, the butterfly flew towards me and rested on my cheek. - Oh no! - The light just died! Great, another blackout. Al, you should've brought some oil from Saudi, I think the town's out of supply again. I might choke on this fishbone. Wait. The next day, I got a message saying that Rosa was already dead. She's been dead for a day. That's why every time I see a butterfly, I remember her. What do you think? Did Aunt Rosa waste her life? Why do you say so? I guess because she rejected what life had to offer. She didn't have the chance to love and to bear a child. She didn't have the chance to travel. Just like you, Al. As they say, "living life." You've been to Saudi already. That's how it should be! - If not, you'll regret it. - Cristy! What are you talking about?! Like I said, everyone has their own way of living life, there's no definitive way. As for us priests, some of us personally want to rectify the wrongs in society, while some of us would just prefer to pray and leave it up to God. How was your life in Saudi, Al? Did you ever feel homesick? A bit. The desert is so vast. It's empty and gloomy, especially at night. The sky is so clear. And you can't see anything else but stars. Countless stars. Every time I look up, I remember my childhood, when we went fishing in Buendia River in the thick of the night, those stars looked exactly like the ones I saw in Saudi. - The stars of Saudi are back! Oh! Excuse me. - Oh, there's still a lot of this! Help yourself, Father. - Blow out the candle. - Want some, Al? It won't go out. Rice cake! Rice cake for sale! Thank you very much. Chayong. - Ilyong. - Oh hey, Gloria. Good morning, Chayong. I have something for you. I'll give it in exchange for a bottle of gin. This is beautiful. Just ask Father to bless it and you can even sell it for a higher amount. Gloria, did you see those girls at the waterfalls? Their bellies are exposed already. Girls these days easily forego their purity. They treat it like earrings that they can easily wear and remove. Oh, you're just jealous. If you want, we can meet by the fields later, Intang. - Let's plow the fields. - You pervert! Don't drag me with you to hell! Here's your liquor. This isn't a fair trade, you know. Before, we made deliveries here daily. Now, we only deliver twice a week. What was that? This place isn't safe nowadays. Is this where you heard the gunshots? Yes, it came from there. - You two. Sarge. - Sir? Stay here first. Let's go! Sarge, let's head back. - Are you sure you heard something? - Yes, Lieutenant. Those terrorists must have raped another woman again. (Whispering) He's not sure. - What are you murmuring there, Goryo? - Nothing, sir. Let's go! Rice cake! Rice cake for sale! Okay. - Bye! - Bye! See you later! Mama... - Cristy, Jimmy's here. - Hi. Good afternoon Cristy, did you come from work? Yeah. - Excuse me, Mama. I'm tired. - Wait a second! Stay and chat with Jimmy first. Did you know he got us permits for our tricycles? Let me get you a... - Wait, I'll go get some snacks. - That won't be necessary. He's leaving already. What? She's right, Gloria. You should stay and chat with Cristy first. - I think he still needs to go somewhere. - Is that so? Good heavens! I can't seem to get used to this telephone. Hello? Hello. Are you dressed right now? I just want to know what you're up to. Yes! That's right! All right. Come here and stay with me. What? Okay. I think I should go. I'll just come back some other time. All right, go ahead if you have to. But be sure to come back and visit Cristy soon okay? Sure. Cristy, Jimmy's leaving already. - Okay, bye Jimmy! - Bye. Jimmy, thanks again for the permits. Come back soon okay? - You pervert! - Yeah, that feels good... What's wrong? Who was that? That guy who keeps calling me but refuses to introduce himself. He says nothing but vulgar things. Don't think I don't notice Christalina. You're always rude to Jimmy. Well, he's used to it. Oh, Rosa. The youth today are so different from our generation. It feels nice to be a tourist in your own hometown, right? Why? Don't you want to be tied down or be rooted in one place? It depends on what ties me down. And I don't like knots! And it depends on the roots as well. There are fake ones, there are real ones, and... Go ahead, continue. Shocking people is your thing, right? You're getting annoyed. I never get annoyed. Even if there are people who are indecisive and fickle-minded, I still respect their differences. Me too. But I respect dedicated people even more. Those who contribute to the welfare of the public. Just like what you do. Your partner towards progress! You've improved at flattery ever since you came back from Saudi. I'm sure all you do is talk in front of the mirror since there are no women in Saudi. You're right. All I could do there was fantasize. It's a good thing I came back. I'm now closer to... Maybe you're just a fantasy as well. What do you think? Here we are. You live here? This is it. Have a seat. Where? Over here. I'm sorry about the mess. I'm all alone here. But if you want, we can stay in my bedroom. I've already fixed it up. Let's just stay here so we won't mess up that bedroom you cleaned. Hold on, I'll just get something. - Al, I don't drink. - But why? I don't like imported products. Don't you have wine? Wine? You mean rice wine? - Try this, it's good. - I don't want to! - That's too strong. - It's good, try it. - Try it. - All right. Just a little. All right... Cheers! To Christalina. Cristy! Cristy. You know Al, your house... it's creepy! It's too dark in here! And all your furniture is covered in sacks. You know what would complete this place? What? Ghosts! And they're all wearing condoms. Better safe than sorry. You're taking a swipe at me again. That's the problem, all I can do is take swipes. Why can't I hit... the bullseye. Continue. If it hits, bullseye! Wait a minute. Do you have some... You have some ice for this? Or are they all in your ice plant? Hold on. - Gotcha! - Wait a second! I can't breathe! Wait! Hey! Hold it. I can't breathe! Al! Wait a second! - Wait! - Cristy... Hold on! I said wait! Wait a second! Wait... Hold on, wait a second. Where's the ice? Ice, please. Thank you. Cheers to Christalina. Cristy. Caress in your hands, Wait. this heart that thirsts, and sway it in the warmth of your being. You are the calm waves in the rivers and springs and with every brush against the rocks, what joy it brings. My yearning heart, caress it with your love. Only your touch can revive this fading love. Go on, my love. I'll do it. Come and caress me. And whenever you caress me, I gain nothing but bliss. Come here, my dear. I hope you grant me this favor of keeping me wrapped in the warmth of your arms. The Lord knows that in these difficult times, it's a big sacrifice for you to lend a hand despite having a hard time to save for your families. As you can see, there's still a lot to be done to finish the construction of our church. Any amount that you can give will do, even just your time and labor would be greatly appreciated by the Lord. What's the real score? Is there something I need to know? About what? Oh, that? Something happened. But I'm not the type who'll kiss and tell. Really? Is he your boyfriend already? Boyfriend? No! How cheesy! What happened? We just got things started. Honestly, I was foolish. I was caught off guard. I guess I got carried away. You know, Nellie, I lost control of myself. Really? You regret what happened? Of course not. What I mean is... I didn't get to practice what I preach. I didn't ask him to wear a... Oh dear. Now I know that you're not good at setting examples. Let us not forget our devotion to the Queen of Peace, Virgin of the Holy Rosary and Blessed Mother of Buendia. Cristy, based on my calculations, we can afford to buy two more tricycles next month. What do you say... What is that? Put those away. Of all the jobs in the world, you had to pick something related to family planning. But Mama... You're defying even God's command to go forth and multiply. And Father Pamfo, he's too liberal. Everything he says is all about social change. But that's how it should be. By the way, Mama... Do you know anyone who can help us with our presentation? It's a small stage show. Our head sacristan, Ilyong. Have you forgotten that he used to perform in zarzuelas? I think he's the only one who honors our old traditions. You're right. Ilyong. But he's been an alcoholic for years, is that also a tradition? Oh the youth of today. Rosa, your niece is driving me crazy. She gives me nothing but headaches. The foolishness she involves herself in! During the war, that place used to be a hiding spot for guerillas like me. That's why I'm familiar with all the barrios in that area. That's why I'm asking you to accompany us. That's the only place in town that hasn't been reached by our program. I heard you know a lot of songs with innuendos? Prospective users have a knack for songs with naughty lyrics. Oh yes. Back in the day, no one could top our zarzuela group. Even the Japanese often invited us to perform onstage. What they didn't know was we wrote those songs ourselves. Wanna hear a sample? Go ahead. Have a seat. We used to sing this back in the day... Remember you told me... that if you're coming, you'd bring me a banana. So that's why... It's been a long time. But if I had even half a bottle of gin, I'm sure I'd remember those lines. Check this out. You're so talented. You should really come with us. I'm confused. I don't know what to do with my life. Should I go back to Saudi or stay here for good? I wish I was a kid again. Whenever you'd sing me a lullaby, I instantly fell asleep. But I left you. We weren't able to patch things up before you died. Forgive me, Mama. Miss? Miss, I think I've seen you before. In the forest. Do you live there? A relative? Why won't you speak? Don't you speak Tagalog? They're my parents. I visit my mother here. I'm Al, an engineer in Saudi. Saudi? Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia? Are they also at war? Are there Japanese people in Saudi? Yes. How come I've never seen you in town? I didn't know someone resided in the woods. Who are you living with? Do you go to school? What's your name? That was a lot of questions, I'm sorry. Auring. Auring. To answer your last question. Auring, what a nice name. What do you do? Do you go to school? I don't. Most of the time, I just stay at home. How's Saudi Arabia? It's a vast desert. You can look out as far as your eyes can see. It's like being close to death. Or like being in a cemetery. Auring. When will I see you again? I often come here. My mother will be pleased. What? I'll get to visit her grave more frequently. The Americans bombed Buendia because they thought there were Japanese soldiers here. At least 30 kids were killed. They were off to school when that bomb exploded. And the saddest part was, there were no longer any Japanese soldiers here during that time. Maybe he couldn't come because he needed to be somewhere. I'm not thinking about that. I can tell if someone's having love woes. What's her name? Who? Your girlfriend during the war. Aurora. Was she pretty? Beautiful. Meek. And she loved flowers. Whenever she laughed, she covered her mouth. Is it true that women were prim and proper back in the day? And were they also faithful to their lovers? There's really no difference. Even family planning existed back in the day, but with different methods. Herbs and roots were used. Makes sense. Were you and Aurora together for a long time? Only for a year. Why was it too short? What happened to her? Those Japanese soldiers killed her. Did you truly love her? I did. I often left my comrades just to be with her. I heard you were quite the player during your time. Yes. And that didn't upset her? It did. We would sometimes fight, but she always emerged victorious. I always ended up on my knees, promising her that I would never lay eyes on another woman again. How did you lose those fights? She would play me the piano. She had this piece that always got my heart melting whenever I heard it. It was in fact a melancholy piece. Wait a second. I've been waiting for you. How are you? I'm fine, I've already visited my parents. I'm on my way home. I've been here for half an hour. How come I didn't see you? - What route did you take? - I used another route. The fruits here are sweet. - How are you? - Still confused. - Want some? - Sure. These times are hard. What? I said these are distressing times. Crimes are getting rampant nowadays. People think of nothing but taking advantage of others. They sell everything, even their souls. That's why I sometimes feel worried. They might even go as far as exhuming my mother's body just to get her gold fillings. Let's go, I guess this is enough. What's wrong? Nothing. You just speak differently. Are you sure you're from here? I think we've lived here longer than you have. You know, you remind me of my mother. You really can't seem to forget your mother. It takes time for me to forget, even the smallest things. Sometimes, those who are already dead are the ones who seem more alive to us. Do you know who's responsible for this? No. And I'm pretty sure that anger won't solve this problem. Maybe the people who did this have something to say, why don't we hear them out? Over there! Make sure that you remove all of those! - Hey, Al. - Father. - Ilyong. - Father. Hey. It's Ilyong! - I bet you were a playboy back in the day. - Not really. It's not my fault that girls were always chasing after me. What if you end up liking two women? Even three would do! As long as they don't find out. How do you court them? By using your seductive eyes, your caring hands? and with your quick- you know how it goes. When a girl says no, it actually means yes. But what if she's the conservative type? Oh, sweet rose. Take my heart. Spare me from grief. Let your fragrance rest upon my chest. Your petals, to me, are heaven-sent. Recite a poem for her! But I don't know how to make a poem. - Do you have gin? - What? A bottle of gin in exchange for one poem. - Good evening, Cristy. - Hi! Are you ready for tomorrow? You can ride on our patrol boat to secure your safety. Lt. Alvarez, is it really dangerous in that place? Or you just want to go on a picnic because you're bored with your job? It's our job to escort POPCOM staff whenever they visit rebel-infested areas. But I really took it upon myself to come because we'll be escorting some special people. Oh, really? How sweet of you, Lt. Alvarez. Do you think we should let him carry this box, Nellie? - Where shall I place this? - Over there. - Thanks. - Anything for you. Oh, it's you. - Good afternoon. - Come in. Have a seat. Wait here. You have a nice house. They're my parents. Come with me. Take a seat. What can I get you? Lime juice, ginger brew, or hot chocolate? No thanks. I insist. - Miss, can I have some? - Please give me some of that. Thank you so much! How are you, Ilyong? These lanzones fruits are very sweet. Do you know the story behind the lanzones fruit? It used to taste bitter but the Blessed Mother's pinch turned it sweet. Here's the sugar in case you want to sweeten it. - How about you? - I'm good, I just had some earlier. What's that on your chest? A medallion, it was pinned on my shirt when I got here. You want it? Thank you. Does it look good on me? Our children should be pampered and loved. But we can't do that if we're struggling to take care of many children. Before my companions show you the different ways of using contraceptives, let's have some fun first. Here's one local that we all know... Mr. Basilio Valdemor! Ilyong? Let's clap our hands for him! I was born in the fields. She and my father made me inside our small house. Even though we're poor, we're rich in rice and vegetables. Nellie, I noticed something about Al. His mind always seems to wander off. Maybe he has a problem. No, I have a feeling he's in love. With you? Then that's great! That's the problem, I'm not sure if it's with me. Why is it a problem? You're not in love with him. Now that's the problem. I think I'm falling for him. That's bad, you need to control yourself. What's this? A poem for you. Why? Nothing, I like it. Oh, sweet rose. Take my heart. Spare me from grief. Let your fragrance rest upon my chest. Your petals, to me, are heaven-sent. You have a lovely voice. I bet you can sing. All I know are old songs. Would you sing for me? I might disturb the souls resting in peace. You won't. Come on, I'll listen. I'll just play an instrument. Go ahead. Mind you I'm not that good, you might make fun of me. My mother was the skilled one. My mother always played whenever we had guests. When she was still alive, she loved having guests. Our house was always full of people. I only know sad melodies. I like sad melodies. She pets her pussycat's fur. Her pussycat's soft, shiny fur. She pets her pussycat's fur. Her pussycat's soft, shiny fur. This is a condom. It's worn like a sock. To ensure that it doesn't have holes, one must blow into it. So that's how it's used! Your hands are cold. Why? Are you scared? What's wrong? Don't be in such a rush. Auring, play some more. Did you truly like it? Those are the various family planning methods. Those who are already familiar with these methods may get some supplies from us. You don't need to go to the center. We have condoms and birth control pills that we're giving away for free. You can get it here! - These are for you. - Over here. I'll go ahead, thanks for the snack. You're welcome. Don't you think I'm unrefined? What? I gave into you right away. What do you mean? How about you? Do you find me easy since I gave into you right away? Why are you sad? I'm not! In fact, I'm very happy today. But why do you look so sad even though you're happy? Why? Okay, I'll go ahead. Al? Are you coming back? Yes. Don't take too long. Cristy! It's Al! Al! Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Ilyong? Ilyong! Ilyong! It's 3 in the morning! You're waking up the entire town! You're drunk again, aren't you? No, Father. How did it happen? I don't know. I just realized that I like them both. What do I need to do? Some priests will ask you to forget one of them. Some would ask you to forget both of them. I'll give you the same advice I gave to those who have confessed to me. Follow your heart. What if my heart tells me to love them both? In the end, you'll have to make a decision. Anything else? That's all. Father of mercies... I absolve you from your sins. In the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. When was your last confession? It was a long time ago. What are your sins? Father, are you sure no one else can hear us? No one except God. Father, I can't control my urges. I get sexual pleasure from the most inappropriate acts. I enjoy peeping and saying sexual things to women over the phone. Example? - Of what I tell them? - Yes, my son. Father... You're committing a grave sin. That's why I came here. Pray three rosaries and one Apostles' Creed. And don't you ever repeat that again. Repeat what, Father? The prayers? No! Those random phone calls to women. Hello? Hello, Al? No, this is Goryo. Boss. It's Cristy. Thank you. Hello? Al? I'd like to tell you something. What is it? You might be busy, never mind. No, it's fine. Never mind, I think you're busy. You don't even have the time to call. I even had to call you myself. I'm sorry. Don't worry, I'll be the one to call next time. It's not that. You don't get it... Then tell me so that I'll understand. How can I tell you when you're already impatient? Cristy, I'm not getting impatient. I'm just confused. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to confuse you. I have to go. Wait a second, what exactly are we talking about? Don't mind me. I'm sorry if I bothered you. Hello? Hello, Cristy? Cristy, what's wrong? Cristy? Cristy? Hello? Cristy? What's wrong? It's Al, isn't it? You love him, don't you? Well, when I learned how to love, even my own mother couldn't stop me. But be careful. That's not the problem. Another girl? I knew that Al can't be trusted. His mother was very fond of men. In fact, we were rivals back in the day. We both fell in love with the same man. Who won? She did. It's only noon... but it's already dark. It might rain. You're right. Let's go around town and eat at a restaurant. I might get used to having you around. It'll be difficult for me without you. Let's go before the rain pours. Why? People might gossip about us. Makes sense. How come I don't see anyone else in your house? They're in Manila. When are they coming back? Tomorrow. You're all alone here? Why do you have so many questions today? Do the townsfolk know your family? Al? I need to rest. I'm feeling dizzy. Auring, there's something you're not telling me. Whenever I get lonely, I go to the town proper... to try and meet new people. But they keep saying unpleasant and untrue things about me. What do they say? You'll know soon enough. The Japanese! Whatever happens, please don't leave me. I love you so much. I feel dizzy. Go get some rest. What is it? I want to see it... - Where's the fan? - Why? Where did you get this? It's a gift from my beloved Aurora, when she was still alive. Why? Ilyong... What's her nickname? Well... Auring. What's the matter? Where does she live? - She's been dead for a long time already. - Where does she live? She lived in a house near the forest, but it was burned down after the war. Here it is. These are Aurora's parents. They were collaborators. And the guerillas executed them when the war was about to end. And here... That's Aurora. Auring... I witnessed her death. I helped her escape when the guerillas burned down their house. But we got ambushed by the Japanese and I got shot in the knee. They raped and killed her. Who is Aurora? When the war ended, they honored me with a medal, but for what? Aurora's gone. Until one night, she came back. Stay away from her, Al. She's been dead for decades. Al! Al! I've been waiting for you. The world out there is full of danger. So much thievery and murder... Are they friends or spies? You don't know who to trust. Stay here. We'll be safe in this place. Here, we can live forever. Auring, I'm confused. Is there another? They do not need you. But I need them. I want some time to think. You're leaving? I'm frightened. That's impossible. When a person dies, his body decomposes. He'll remain unseen unless he finds a body he can possess. That's what science teaches us. But Father, there are many things that can't be explained by science. What must I do? Alcohol is not the answer to any question, Ilyong. Let's go to that place, I'll ask some soldiers to accompany us. You can go without me. Just tell me about it when you get back. Ilyong... - Is Al here? - He left early. He went to the woods. - The woods? - Yes. Thanks. Thank you. Watch your step, you might slip. - Boss, what's the matter? - Have you seen Cristy? Yeah, she just left. She was looking for you. You didn't see her? I think she's on her way to the woods, I told her you were there. Don't be afraid. I'm sorry, you startled me. I was knocking at your door but no one answered. Have a seat. Thanks. Do you like it? The house? - Father, where did you say Cristy was? - According to Ilyong, she went to the woods. - My god! - That place is dangerous. It's nice. It's really beautiful. I only see these kind of houses in movies. You know, I'd be terrified to live here. There may be ghosts. You get used to it. My name is Auring. I'm Cristy. I'm from the town. I just... Does anyone else live here? No. Why do you ask? Are you looking for someone? I sense that there's something you wish to say. I have a feeling that... you have something to do with my problem. Me? I have something to do with your predicament? How is that possible? Auring, I know that you know why I'm here. I do not. Al was here, wasn't he? You know him as well? He's my boyfriend. He loves me. - Stay away from him. - Why? - I love him. - I love him too. - I loved him first. - Is this even a race? - I'm prepared to die for him. - I cannot live without him. Who are you anyway? You're not even from here. I am. This is my house. You are merely a guest. You take pride in this old and shabby house? It's like a cemetery. Please leave. You have no right to take Al away from me. You're only causing trouble. I'm pregnant. And Al's the father! Stop it! Very well, he's yours! Men are all the same. He's just like Basilio. I thought I could depend on him. I thought he could help me. But he did nothing! Who are you? They've caused me so much pain. They're all the same! You're Aurora? But you're dead... You're already dead... Auring! Cristy... Al! Al, let's go home! I'm afraid! You must choose between the two of us. Al, she's already dead. Al, let's go. Come on! I love the both of you. That cannot be, Al. You need to choose one. If you choose her, you'll die as well. We'll live here in peace. You've been longing for peace, right? Al... NPA! You have to come with me, Al. - Auring! - Al! Al... Al... Al! Mama? - Cristy! - Mama? Come here, Cristy! Mama? - Al! - Cristy! Al! Let's go after Al. - Al! - I'm coming with you. Auring! Auring! Help me! How's your wound? I'm fine, Father. Sarge, carry on. Auring! Auring! Let go of me! Please! Let go of me! Auring... Please... Auring! Al? Al! Al! - What happened? - The house... The house is in flames! The house is on fire. - House? - What house? Auring? The house is burning! It's nothing but ruins, Al. It was burned down during the war. Let's go. Sarge! - How's Al? - It's just a case of culture shock. He was away for a long time. And when he came back, the people had changed and so had he. He also had to endure his mother's death. I'm sure he'll recover soon. That place is really dangerous. I've already called for reinforcements, we'll sweep that place clean. By the way Father, when's the burial? Ilyong... Many are saying that he committed suicide, but I don't agree with them. We'll give him a Christian burial. Maybe on the day after tomorrow, we're just waiting for his only sibling to arrive. Boss, Cristy wants to talk to you. Al? Can you hear me? Al, talk to me. I'm postponing my return to Manila. I'm staying. The main office extended my services here. I still have a lot to accomplish. Auring's gone. I need you to come back to me, Al. I love you. Al... I'll do whatever you ask. Just don't leave me. You can't leave me like this. You mustn't leave me like this, Al. Keep in mind that we're here for your welfare. And I know something's stopping you from cooperating with the government. What's the matter with you? Why don't you give us your trust?! Cristy, I'm worried about you. All you do is watch over Al. You might end up neglecting yourself and your work. Tell me, Nellie... - Do you believe it? - Believe what? That Al and I saw Auring. I'm sure you think it was just our imagination. Al, I'm doing this for you. Whatever happens to me, always remember that I love you. Auring? Where are you, Auring? Help me. I love Al so much. You love him as well, don't you? Let's help him. I can't do it alone. I've been waiting for you.
