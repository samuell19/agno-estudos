ORESTE PIPOLO wedding photographer Today I'm taking pre-marriage photos of Lello and Maria. They work in a delicatessen. He's the owner, she's at the register. I'm going, unannounced, to take a few pictures. Give me the film, Salvatore! Give me the film! It's important to capture aspects of the couple's daily life, that's pre-marriage to me. It's only two days to their wedding. Best wishes from my heart. Give me a package of that thin spaghetti up there. I was lucky with marriage because we were in love and we still are. That's how your lives will be, because babies are born, your love grows deeper because you love the children, they're the life of life. A big hand for Maria! - Mr. Pipolo, how are you? - Fine, thanks. Look at me, Lello. We've known each other for 14 years, Oreste and me. Husband and wife both have to work, just one salary won't be enough to pay Oreste. We all take pictures, but you should see his. Even I can snap a picture, but Oreste's are good, they cost big bucks! We say: no Mass without money, no toast without honey. Let's get moving. Marco, make some coffee. I still haven't had any! When will you trash this tie? You never change it. Wait, I'll do the knot for you. Salvatore! Have you got the reflectors? Is it all in the car? See you at the bride's house. - Ma'am, where's the bride? - There. Where's Salvatore? All the best. Hold it like that. Wait a minute. Hi, Maria, how are you? All the best. Salvatore, lighten it. On that day you have to be a guide, the bride's mirror, because nobody will have the nerve to tell the bride: "Fix your hair, it doesn't look good” or: "Your dress is crooked". I have to be very sincere with this person, capture her mind. Salvatore, come here. Keep this held up. Hold that position. Head lower, like that. Poor window! You have to enter the bride's mind. It's not easy, you have to start when you first meet her, understand how she'd like to look, not how she really looks. Don't ever talk about pictures but understand who you're talking to. The bouquet in the other hand. Maria, head lower! Good, look here. Hold it. Good, good, like that. Smile! Stay just like that. - Can I take a pastry? - Sure. Can I offer one to my assistants? What's this? Almond milk? Salvatore, want some wine or vermouth? What's in that jug? - Can I takeit? - Whatever you like. Get that off. Salvatore, don't let go. It's off. Wait a minute. I bet you'll put me in that frame! Want to remove the glass? Leave it like that. Don't worry, it won't fall. Luca, get behind her. Get behind with the painting. Maria, move forward a little. Luca, don't let your hands show! Good. I may wreck your home, but the result will be beautiful. Don't worry. Go Oreste, put light on the rose. Look at her in roses and flowers. This one has no light at all. This Pipolo, what chaos! Marco, on her hair! The Church of St. Paul in Casoria? Keep going straight, Casoria's over the bridge, ask there. Know who he is? The photographer, Enzo Pipolo. Oreste Pipolo. A few kilometers down on the right. - Go that way. - But the road's torn up. Then go this way. At the first intersection, turn, it goes to the Church of St Paul. - Should he turn left or right? - Right. Thanks. - That's Oreste Pipolo. - I know. Hold it like that. Ma'am, give him a kiss. What stress! Mamma, put the rings on the cushion! Hello counselor, how are you? Please have a seat. When is your wedding? The wedding is on October 7th 1998. After the service we'll be going home. To our own home. Could we take some special photos at our house? - We have a nice terrace. - Not very big. I did that once. It's the couples' home, and so.... Our yellow refrigerator... Something a little different. Something a little less formal, a little nicer. A shot of us in the garden, maybe confetti or petals floating down, because Mamma lives upstairs. You can take our picture from above, Mamma lives above us. I could propose something even more unusual, I don't know if you'd like it. I have some 18th century costumes. - It's a proposal for those... - Are they actors? No, they're stand-ins. Close your eyes. Come on, run. Go! They're beautiful, but we'd like something more traditional, like the weddings of years ago. I'd like you to help us be spontaneous. That's fundamental. They're all beautiful. It gives us the chance to find the photogenic quality of the couple. What will your ceremony be like? We'll have singers from the opera theater, a mezzo-soprano and all the usual instruments for the liturgy of a classical ceremony. There'll be a floral decoration. Have you already chosen your music? That's in the hands of an agency. There's an Ave Maria by Paisiello. We'll have the traditional Ave Maria. - Schubert's or Gounod's? - Schubert's. But Gounod's would be nice, I'll let you hear it. The management of the Grand Hotel La Sonrisa is pleased to wish the couple a very happy day and invites guests to join them for aperitifs. All the guests of the Grannunzio-Gacioppi couple are kindly invited to the swimming pool for the newlyweds' entrance. Hold it. Ma'am, please. When we take pictures, his are always the best. But I like to watch him, provoke him photographically. He's the kind that stops at nothing. When he's taking pictures there are no limits, he just shoots pictures, that's it. Once I stood back and said to myself: "He's a painter.” He's a painter because his shots are paintings, not photos. You have to be handsome. Next wedding you have fo be thinner. Ma'am, hold still, let me fix your necklace. Don't show it like that. Look there, look at the camera. Look at the camera. - Who's the lady? - My aunt. - Aunt who? - Aunt Marisa. Stand a little more... How am I supposed to stand? This is the best I can do! All the guests of the Abbate - Parisi wedding are invited to the swimming pool for the newlyweds' entrance. We know the bride comes, we clap and then go for refreshments. The most beautiful bride in Italy is coming, her name is Mena Parisi. She's the most beautiful. After the refreshments we go to a beautiful room, I don't know what number. We just wait our turn. Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for the bride and groom and a warm welcome to the Grand Hotel La Sonrisa. Our very best to the newlyweds wishing them and all of you a pleasant afternoon. Enjoy the meal and your stay here with us at the Grand Hotel La Sonrisa Our chef's specialties served directly to your tables, the seafood specialties of the Grand Hotel La Seonrisa. Let's give the staff a big hand! This is one of the imperial suites we offer couples who get married at La Sonrisa. This enterprise wasn't envisioned for making money. We wanted to create an image that would benefit the country, Naples and the Naples area. The architect was one of the best and although I don't want to brag, I designed this building in Venetian Baroque style, it meant a lot fo me. I really like this style. The management of the Grand Hotel La Sonrisa wishes a very happy day to the bride and groom and invites the guests to follow them to the aperitif area. Let's have a big hand for the bride and groom and we welcome them to the Grand Hotel La Sonrisa. Ladies and gentlemen, with the emblematic figure of the Neapolitan urchin, the Grand Hotel La Sonrisa presents our gastronomy. A hearty applause for the staff! Let's clap to the music! Everything happens here, people arrive in helicopters, we're aftacked from air and seq, bridal couples arrive here by every imaginable means. This heliport is used by the more ambitious couples who want to take wedding pictures at Capri, the Blue Grotto, Faraglioni, the Piazzetta, and also by important people. Industrialists often fly fo Naples, and then join us by helicopter. Everything alright? The worst is over. Your wedding is certainly a little more simple, more traditional, based on simplicity. It's a celebration for our parents for the joy of seeing us united, so it all has to be spontaneous, the fundamental ingredient. Everything must be accompanied by nice photographic memories. Even our children, if the Lord grants us, will want to see this memento. I think there's nothing more to say. We trust we'll have the superb photos you're renown for. Goodbye, see you on the 7th. Marco, please go to the tailor and pick up that suit for the groom. The suit for Mr. Pipolo, please. Mr. Pipolo's suit. Excuse me? TRUCKERS HOMESTYLE RESTAURANT I come here often to eat, to get away from the environment of ceremony. When you've done weddings for nearly 30 years, sometimes you want to get away. Coming here is like going back to my origins, being more in touch with myself. Can you bring more to drink? He's been coming here for years and always has the same thing: beans and codfish. He's a great photographer and a great son-of-a... As they say in Naples, the common folk say, he's a great son-of... He's Neapolitan. Look at me, like that, good. Lean on him a little more convinced, heavens, what a face! Smile, turn your head like that, good, like that, okay thanks. Dad, you've got to move! Good lord! - lock the door. - Walk ahead. Watch the carpet. As it's your intention to join in matrimony, clasp your right hands and speak your consent before God and His Church. I, Rita, take you, Tiziano, as my husband and promise to be faithful in joy and in sorrow, in sickness and in health, and to love and honor you all the days of my life. Rita, receive this ring as a symbol of my love and faithfulness, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Get moving! Open your eyes. We got married for work reasons, but also because we love each other. I work in a factory in Modena, on the assembly line. He found a job so we could finally get married, after being engaged six years. I'm sorry to leave Naples, but I'd do this and more for his job. Look at me. light! Hold it, smile, close your eyes. Smile! I chose him because... Oreste Pipolo has a reputation in Naples, he's good. They call him the Master of Naples. The only thing that remains from a wedding are the photos. Another kiss. Kiss it up, like that! Hey, diver! Can I include you with them in a picture? Come up this way, please. Smile a little! Don't make that face, come on! Look down. Look this way and smile. Close your eyes and open them when I say. There is sadness in marriage. Because your son's always been with you, you know he won't be coming home in the evenings anymore, but you're not unhappy. You believe he's found a good companion. What am I supposed to do? They're going north. When will I see my son again? Christmas? In summer? Eventually they'd have married anyway, but without a job they couldnt marry right now. Let's not fool ourselves, without the strength of money, a marriage can be negative. You need your daily bread as well as your daily love. Only a job can give you your daily bread. In life everyone has to look for his own destiny. It's sad when someone's missing. Like my brother for the loss of our father who should be here for this ceremony. That's why sometimes there's a veil of sadness. My son kept me awake until three the other night: "Mamma, I'm glad to be getting married, I'm happy, but someone's missing”, and I understood. He lost his father when he was about three, but he remembers him and says: "I never had a father”, "I've always missed him". And he still misses him . These are nice. Look at this one, is that any way to cut a shot? No, but it could have meaning. The customer doesn't care about meaning. I can't say: "Salvatore sees meaning in it.” Sorry, you always say yes... Can't you see their eyes are closed? - It's our only one? - Yes. The easy photos don't interest you! Maybe because the easiest ones are the most boring, but I do my best. Salvatore, honestly, you don't fry. It's too easy to joke about, you could do much better. What's she doing? Singing? Probably. - What do you mean “probably”? - Maybe it's a friend of hers. Probably. She was saying good hello to her. What did you do with the suit? Everything's alright? Teresa, let's get going, it's late. Let's lock up, close the shutters and let's go. Your cell phone, the keys to the Vespa... - The keys to the Vespa? - Here. The lights. Salvatore, my camera's empty.
