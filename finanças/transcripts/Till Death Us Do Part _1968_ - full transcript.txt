21 years after defeat in the great war to end wars Germany parades her military strength. Today's German war machine presents an awe-inspiring spectacle. Manpower in the millions. Thousands of aeroplanes, guns and tanks. The last word in scientific skill and destructive power. They're all cardboard they are. All bloody cardboard, ain't they? Oh, blimey.

Oh blimey, look at 'em. Load of bloody squareheads. Get off! Of a parliamentary system as it is today. Fascism and fascism alone stands for the revolutionary change in that system. Fascism alone is determined to modernise and rationalise civilization. As I was saying, we give 'em bloody super race last time, didn't we, eh? They get the bloody same they start again and your bloody itai, Musso. I mean, he's alright having a go at a bunch of ignorant bloody wogs out in Abyssinia but he starts on us mate and he'll find out he's up against more than a few bloody spears, I tell ya!

He's out in the wilderness, en' he? Chamberlain's your Prime Minister. He's the one what knows. Course we're armed. Armed to the bloody teeth, we are. Rag and bone Any old lumber? Any old rags, bottles and bones? Bring out your lumber. Any old rags, bottles and bones? Any old lumber? Your British lion might be asleep but he ain't bloody dead mate. They pull his tail and he'll turn round and bite their bleedin' head off. Get off out of it. What the bloody hell's this then? It come today. It's your gas mask and your shelter. Shelter?

On the booze last night, was ya? Yeah, I had a drop. I don't think it's that, though. Never done it before, not the beer ain't. Ahh, it's probably a bug innit? It could be, I suppose. Get a lot of 'em round here, ya know? They come off the boats you see. It's your bloody coloureds that bring them in. Yeah. Looks a bit black dunnit? What? Papers. Threatened to go in to Poland, en' he? What, Hitler? Yeah. He won't, we told him he mustn't and he won't. Dunno, I don't like the look of it me-self. I mean, don't suppose he's got any planes for a start off. Dunno, he's got the planes alright. Yeah, well he might have, he might have but has he got the strategical raw materials? You what? The petrol! Petrol. I should think so. He seems to have most things, dun' he? Soon cut his supplies off, can't we? I mean, look, he ain't got enough petrol of his own, has he? I mean, ain't got no bloody oil wells in Germany, has he? He's gotta go abroad for it, en' he? Right, all we gotta do then, blockade him. Bung the navy on his doorstep. That'll soon 'em up. Same as we done in the last lot. Cut him off. Finished? Yeah, for now. Don't know how long for though. See ya, Alf. Do you want a cup of tea? Course I do. Silly moo. Ooooowwww! We interrupt this programme to remind you that the Prime Minister will broadcast to the nation at 11.00 a.m. on this wavelength. Ooh, ooh. The blessing of God almighty be with you and remain with you, now and always. You have been listening to Songs of Praise brought to you by the BBC singers from our studio. There will now be a short interlude of piano music. What you got this door locked for? I'm having a bath en' I? Well, there's only me in the house and I've seen you without your clothes on. It's nothing to do with that. I am entitled to a bit of privacy, en' I? Yes, well, I want to get out the back. Well, you'll have to wait my dear, won't you? I can't wait. Bloody woman. Look, every time I get in the bath you wanna go out the back. Hurry up, I'm bursting. It ain't bloody fair. Don't shut the door, will ya? Bleedin' moo. Oh god, no. This is the BBC. Here is the Prime Minister, the right honourable Neville Chamberlain. I am speaking to you from the cabinet room of 10 Downing Street. This morning, the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared, at once, to withdraw their troops from Poland a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now, that no such undertaking has been received and that consequently this country is at war with Germany. Right. Come on! You was wrong, wasn't you? About not going to be a war, wasn't you? Look, I said he wouldn't start nothing with us. That's what I said. And he ain't has he because it's us what started on him. Bloody well serves him right, too. 'Cause he's been asking for it for a long time. And now he's gonna get it! I bet old Adolf's shakin' in his bloody shoes right now. About that thing, I wondered what the hell it was. Didn't you? Nothin' up there, is there? Except a few clouds. False alarm, en' it? False alarm, Grandad! Hey? Blimey, somebody must've panicked. You coming up the pub then, Alf? Right panic, en' it? You goin' to the pub like that then? Please stand by for the important government announcement which will follow almost immediately. Cor blimey, it'll be all over soon enough. - Yeah? - Yeah. Be all over soon, Fred. I bloody hope so. ♪ We're gonna hang out the washin' on the Siegfried line ♪ ♪ Have you any dirty washin' Mother dear? ♪ ♪ We're gonna hang out the washin' on the Siegfried line ♪ Hey, Alf? You playing bloody darts or having a sing-song? Just buying a drink. This is the BBC Home and Forces programme. Here is the Prime Minister, the right honourable Neville Chamberlain. I'm not now going to make any comment upon the debate in the House of Commons which took place on Tuesday and Wednesday last. By the afternoon of today, it was apparent that essential unity could be secured under another Prime Minister, though not under myself. In those circumstances, my duty was plain. I sought an audience of the King this evening and tendered to him my resignation which His Majesty has been pleased to accept. His Majesty has now entrusted, to my friend and colleague, Mr Winston Churchill the task of forming a new administration on a national basis and in this task, I have no doubt, he will be successful. It'll be all over soon now, it'll be all over soon. Now we got someone a bit decent up there. Get a bit of bloody action now, hey? Ain't we? There is no cause for alarm, is there? I mean, it's strategical, en' it? See, strategical withdrawal, that's the way I see it. See, what he's done, what Winston has done is pulled us all back here to our own island fortress. I mean, froggies have let us down ain't they? - Same as last time. - Yeah. Course, they turned it in, ain't they? Useless. Course, well they can't fight. - No. - No. Never could bleedin' fight. So, what he's done see, what your Churchill has done, in his infinite wisdom is brought us all back here so we can stand shoulder to shoulder, together, and know that your left flank will not let your right flank down. Right. See? And let him, let your Gerry set one foot in that English Channel and we'll blast him out of it. Because we've got a Navy, Grandad, and he ain't. And your Navy. His Majesty the King's Royal Navy are sitting out there in the Channel. Our bleedin' Channel! Waiting for him and hopin', hopin' he'll try and come across. Just hopin' he will. They'll have 'im. They'll have 'im for this. You mark my... words. Who will? Your League of Nations, that's who. Bombing innocent civilians. And women and children. Bloody swine! Cowardly bloody swines! Come down 'ere and fight like men, come on, come down 'ere! Bastards. Women and children. Oh God, not again? That's five times tonight. Don't them bloody Germans ever sleep? Oi, come on! I'm not going down that shelter no more tonight. Look, come on, come on, it's overhead! I don't care where it is. If I'm gonna die, I'll die in me bed, not going down that shelter no more tonight. Look, you silly moo. Alf? Alf, where are you? I'm 'ere. I'm under the bed. You alright? No! I've not the bleedin' piss pot over now, en' I? Oh! Home to your wives, let us take the other one up. Right then, let's be havin' you. On the double, come on lads, move yourselves. Get your fingers out. Move yourselves! Right, give a one, two, three, four, move. Come on, move. Get a move on with those magazine boxes, can't you? Come on, don't be stingy, put some more on. Get out the bloomin' way. Bob, alright? Got a packet for me, have ya? Yeah I know, but, regular en' I? Sorry mate, no fags and no baccy. Won't always be a bloody war on, you know? Here you are beautiful, have that for your supper. Ooh, thank you. Pigs. Bloody, greedy pigs. No bloody butter and coloured bread. Here's your tea. Spam again? Well, it's all he had up the shop. Oh, I dunno. The bombs don't kill us we're gonna starve to death with this crap. Well, it's not my fault. It's the rationing. Rationing? Fat load of rations they've got out there in that bloody gun. Well, they're fighting. Fighting? They've been out there for months, they ain't shot one bloody plane down yet! Well, give 'em a chance. They're only lads. I'll give 'em a chance. Look, all they're doing, my dear is giving away our position to the enemy. Ooh err. Soppy bloody Sergeant of theirs. And how he ever got three stripes. He must've done a lot of bloody crawling to get there and that's all I can say. - Enough of that language! Well! It makes you bloody mad, it do. Just because he wouldn't let you buy any of their fag rations. Got nothin' to do with that! I bet her in number 18's not short of fags. I'll bet she gets her share, alright. Because you're not gonna tell me it's only tea that bloody Sergeant gets when he goes in there. Disgusting. Bloody disgusting, it is. Your mind. He's a mate of her husband. Yeah, fine bloody mate he is. Knockin' his wife off while he's out fighting in the desert. There is nothing going on there at all. Nothing going on? Get off out of it. Bloody soldiers, they're all the same. Glad I ain't got a daughter. I'd lock her up if I had. I'll make a pie out of this tomorrow. I bet she will an' all. Oh god, en' it marvellous. No bloody tobac. Got any fags, dear? No, I ain't. You're not having any of those. I swapped you my meat and bacon ration for your sweet coupons and I'll eat them all myself. Ooh, I just remembered. A letter come for you this morning. And why didn't you tell me? Well, I forgot didn't I? Forgot? Give us that 'ere. Pig. 'ere, looks important doesn't it. On His Majesty's service, it says. You haven't been writing to him, have you? His Majesty? Don't talk daft. I sent him a birthday card. When? On his birthday, of course. Perhaps he sent you one? It's not my birthday, is it? Silly moo. Well, open it, see what he wants. What's he say? It must be a mistake, this. Well, what's he say? A call-up. Call-up papers for the army. They can't... Can't call me up. They're not allowed to. You've gone all white. Well I'm reserved, en' I? I'm reserved occupation, en' I? I thought you wanted to go and fight? Yeah, well so I would. I would like to be out there. But I'm, I'm more important here, en' I? Same as Churchill. Time-keeper? I don't see how that's so important. You'd bloody well like to see me go, wouldn't you? Well, anyway, you'll be able to eat and smoke to your hearts content then, like them out there. I'm going up the pub! Got any fags in yet, Fred? Er, sorry, can't seem to get hold of 'em for love nor money. I've had an order in for weeks now. Here, I tell you what though. Got some scotch in. Oh yeah, well, I'll have a drop of that. Johnnie Walker. Yeah well, make it a big one, will ya? Ta, cheers. That'll be two and eight pence. You don't mind waiting till Friday, do you Fred? Er, I'm sorry Alf. No credit, mate. Oh well, I mean. You know me, Fred. You'll get your money. I'm sorry, Alf. I can't afford to give credit. I mean, with all these air raids who knows if you're gonna be here Friday? I mean, they caught a Paki round the corner last night. I'm losing custom all the time, I am, through these air raids. I lost 20 of my regulars in the past few months. I mean, it's bad enough losing customers but losing 'em when they owe ya money. No, I just can't take the risk. Sorry mate. Rotten sod. 'Ere, I tell you what. Come in Friday, if you're still with us. Provided you are, mate. Provided you are! Two large scotch, please? Oh, move yourself. Come on, move yourself! Oooww! Bloody Germans. Why they gotta come out on a night like this? They're only supposed to come out on clear nights. I don't see why we gotta come all this way up here? Look, it's safer up here innit. I mean, your tube is underneath the ground level innit? I mean, bloody government. They ain't sleeping in no Anderson shelters, are they? No. Bloody hundreds of foot down they are, mate. And they started the bloody war, didn't they? Oi, oi, oi, watch where you're treading mate. Oh, I'm terribly sorry but I'm trying to get through. No need to go trampling all over people, is there? I'm terribly sorry but it is rather difficult. Difficult? All you gotta do is use your bloody eyes, mate. Well, I am sorry. Look, you didn't oughta be down here anyway, did ya? You oughta be up there, mate. That's where you oughta be. In your bloody aeroplane. Shush. Well, never mind about shush. I mean, if he was up there doing his job proper we wouldn't have to be down here, would we? Yes, well, I really am very sorry. Pig, you are. At least in the old days your officers was gentlemen, weren't they? I mean, nowadays any little toffee nosed twit can put his pips up. Do we have to listen to that bloody row all night? I like it, it's jolly. Better than sittin' at home with just you for company. Look I don't mind a sing-song, do I? A good old British song. I mean that's a Gerry song, innit? She was whore, she was. Lili Marlene. Bloody prostitute, used to, used to give herself to soldiers, she did. Disgusting. And you oughta be ashamed of yourself singing a bloody song like that. Ought to be ashamed of yourselves, the lot of ya! Shut up! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves singing a disgusting song. You shut up an' all, mate. Listen, it's a public place 'ere, innit? And all that stuff is a bloody obscene song that, innit? Sergeant. - Evening. - Evening. Evening. Lovely evening now, innit? I thought you was being called up, Mr Garnett? No, no. Oh, I thought I heard something about it. No, it was a mistake. Oh. Yeah. Reserved occupation, en' I? Wanted to go, you know? Pleaded with 'em, they wouldn't have it. Worried the wife a bit, you know? Oh yeah. She was crying, she was. I said look dear, I said, I don't want to, do I? Oh, course not. Those other fellas have gone, ain't they? It's my duty to go.

Look, I'm telling you, you can take that bloody poster down. I am not having Harold bloody Wilson stuck in my window. It's my poster. And it's my bloody window and that poster's coming out of it. Right. Now then. Stick your window. I shouldn't think Harold Wilson would want to be stuck in your window anyway. No? No! Well, it don't bloody well matter what he wants, does it? 'Cause he ain't gonna be stuck in it, is he? So there. Typical Tory attitude, Dad. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Yeah? I thought we're all supposed to be democratic in this country? Yeah, never mind Look, lemme ask you a question? Would your Harold, would your darlin' Harold Wilson let me put a Tory party poster in his bloody window? No, course he bloody well wouldn't.

Just because you vote Tory, everybody else in the house should. Oh yeah. Yes. Well, look, you never thought of voting Labour did ya? Not till you took up with that bloody soppy boyfriend of yourn. Now, now. Ooh, that annoys you, dunnit? That gets right up your nose, dunnit, eh? Oh no, it don't. It's got nothing to do with what sort of a person he is, has it? It's just because he happens to be a socialist, that's all. It's got nothing to do with that, look... If it was some little Tory twit I was gonna marry, you wouldn't care. It's got nothing to do... That's all you've got against him because he happens to be cleverer than you. Cleverer than me? Yeah, well, he is. Belt up. Because he knows that the only party that's ever gonna do anything for people like us is the Labour Party. - The Labour Party? - Yeah. Oh blimey, the Labour Party. Get off out of it.

Well, that's what I'm saying and what have you got to show for it? Well, I've got house en' I? I've got house of me own. It's more than that bleedin' long-haired boyfriend of yours has got. Look at him. Grinning bloody monkey. Look, if he's not welcome here... No-one's saying he's not welcome. No, your Dad didn't say that. Didn't say he weren't not welcome.

That'd be the gear. At least it'll take the taste of that soap factory out of my mouth. I'm not kidding, it's murder walking past that place. You know what I reckon the first thing the Labour party ought to do? Knock all this area down. Well, cor blimey, it's worse than Liverpool round here. Oi, oi. Your Labour Party will have to get permission from some of the property owners around here before they start knocking anything down because for your information, Little Lord Fauntleroy, not all of the owners of property round here happen to be members of your party. I don't understand you, you know. A working man voting Tory. He's been conned. Look, it's a free-country innit? Believe in what I wanna believe in. Oh, it's a free-country is it? Yes. Then why can't she have her poster in the window then, eh? Because it might be a free-country outside but in here it's not. See, because this house happens to be my property and I decide what goes in my own bloody windows. Right? Sieg heil. I suppose you think you're bloody funny, don't ya? Listen, I fought, I fought for the right to decide what goes on in my own house, sonny. I fought hard, I did. Fought? Fought where? Never you mind. I fought. Oh MI5, eh? Oh yeah, that's it, see a typical, typical... If I didn't care then I'd tell you something. What? Your medals are showing. Look, are you coming in or aren't you? Oh, it's early. It's not half past 11 yet. That's not the point, is it? I gotta go to work tomorrow, en' I? And I want some bloody sleep. Look, get off of her you randy scouse git. Ooh. Look, a register office wedding is not a proper wedding, is it? What you talking about, not a proper wedding? It's not proper to Him, is it? I mean, it's not a wedding in His eyes. Who's eyes? His eyes. Your God's eyes. Oh, cor blimey, you and your Almighty God. I only hope he can hear you. Oh get off, of course he can't hear me. Look, he hears all and he sees all, don't he? Sees all? Yes mate, he sees all because the good Lord is everywhere, en' he? Everywhere? Yes mate, everywhere? Yes! What he's in bloody Wapping? Yes he is in bloody Wapping. Is he in this street?

Oh look, you moan because we wasn't getting married in a church and now we are getting married in a church you're still moaning. Because it's a bloody Roman church. Look, you wanna get married in a church you get married in her church. In Her Majesty the Queen's church. Look Dad, we're doing it for Mike's Mum, she's a very devout Roman Catholic. Very religious, you're not. Who ain't religious? I'm as religious as anybody else is. I've been to church. Twice. Mike's Mum goes every Sunday. Look, I said I was religious. Didn't say I was a bloody religious maniac. Dad, we're getting married in a Roman Catholic church whether you like it or not, so there. Alright, alright then.

And he doesn't either, I'm happy to say. In the, in the old days. Yeah, in the old days. There was only the one church in the whole of the universe and that was God's church, the catholic church. - No, don't... All the rest is break aways, just break aways. Don't try teaching me. I know... Listen, listen, if you shut up for a minute. You might learn something I, I don't have you to tell me, do I? Get off out. No wait, wait until I tell you now and you'll see. Take your church, your own Church of England. Cor alright. That belonged to the Pope for years and still would if it hadn't been for your King Henry who wanted more wives than the Pope would allow him. You see, the catholic church says one wife only. That's all you need, that's all you're supposed to have. That's all I bloody need, mate. But your King Henry is terrible and martyred man. Who says? And a bad catholic as well. What are you talking about? The Pope, his holiness, he excommunicated him. Oh yeah. And Henry, you see, he formed his own church you see. Which was his church not God's church. Here, that's according to your Pope, yeah. He's a bloody itai en' he? According to our queen, Her Majesty the Queen of England, there's another one. I have no allegiance to her. The only allegiance I have is to me own country. Oh yeah. The land of me birth. Oh yeah, you should bloody well go back there then mate. Yeah. I'll buy you the ticket. I've said nothing against the girl. But you did Mam, you bloody well did. You said that you wished that I hadn't married her. - I did not say that, Michael. - Yes you did. I did not. You, you did. I said that I'd wished you'd waited and married someone of your own faith. Oh, well that's nice isn't it? Thank you. There's plenty of nice catholic girls about.

How many more times have I gotta tell you, we ain't gotta move. We've all got to move. The whole street's coming down, Dad. It ain't coming down, I tell ya. A lot of people in this street have been told to move already. So they might have because they only pay rent. Cor blimey, look, everybody knows the whole street's coming down. And I say it ain't. And the council says it's is. The council ain't said nothing of the sort. Hello, Alf. Well that's it then, Alf, it's official now innit, eh? We're all being cleared out. Typical bloody Labour innit, eh? There's supposed to be a shortage of houses. Instead of building new ones, they're knocking down the ones we already got. Yeah, we're all going to Essex they reckon. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well I'm not going to bloody Essex, mate. And they're not knocking my bloody house down neither. We was right, wasn't we? They are pulling the street down. Shut up. Well they are, aren't they? Yeah well, this is my house. Not the bloody councils and I'll say whether it comes down or not. And another thing. Not bad condition. Yes, I've made a note. Floorboards too. Yeah, they're not very good. Who the bloody hell's that? They're from the council. They've come round to value the house for you. They've come to do... Bloody cheek. Oi, oi, what's your bloody game then? Never mind about agreement. This house ain't for sale, mate. And even if it was for sale. And even if it was for sale, I am the one who'd do the valuing, not you. No bathroom, outside toilet. Look, are you bloody deaf? I said this house ain't for sale now hop it. We have a compulsory order to purchase, Mr Garnett. Alright, alright. Well you can bloody well stick it, mate. Thank you. 300 I'd say. 300? Three of four. Three or four? Look, I, I paid 1500 pound for this. You were robbed. Shut up, you. Look, when I bought this house. I bought it off the council, didn't I? And the valued it at 1500 pound and they gave me a mortgage on it, too. But the house is coming down, Mr Garnett. We're just dealing with land value. There's no house value left. You rotten swindling bastards. You can take it up with the council. Yeah? Yeah, I will. I will, don't you worry. I'll take it higher than the council. Take it to the House of Lords, I will. You're lucky I didn't lay one on you there. I would be so grateful. I mean, they're robbing me ain't they? 1500 pound they valued the house at when they sold it to me. Now they wanna buy it back, it's only worth 300. So they say. I mean, that's not the way you like people to do business is it? It's all that bloody Wilson it, sorry Lord, he's enough to make a saint swear ain't he? I mean, I don't know why you let him win that last election. I'm, I'm not blaming you, you know. You've got your reasons for things. I know that. It's probably a punishment on us, eh? A skurge bloody has been, ain't he? Anyway, Lord, if you could see your way clear to let me keep my little house. I mean, God Almighty. I don't wanna move all the way out to Essex. Almighty God. Do I? I mean, who's gonna pay my fares back and forth to work every day? You see my point of view, can't you? I gotta get up earlier in the morning, I'll get home late at night. It makes it very difficult for Mummy, you know? I mean, there ain't a pub for miles. Nor a church, Lord. I mean, nearest church is three mile away. You know what I mean? There's a lot of them that ain't gonna walk that far, are they? See? So, in a way, you see it is you they're having a go at, innit? 'Cause I mean, they're all atheists you know? That Labour lot. Anyway, Lord, if you could see your way clear. I mean, if there's anything I could do for you? I tell you what, I'll put some money in the box, eh? Yeah. Ooh, oh. Oh, gives you chip don't it? Half a crown be alright? Well, make it five bob, eh? Evening, Fred. Pint of beer, please? Oh, when are you leaving us then, Alf? I don't know, Fred. Might not be leaving at all now. We're gonna, gonna fight 'em, huh? On the beaches, fight. All gone to bed, ain't they? Deserted me. Still alone. Still alone. I fight, I fight 'em. I'll fight bloody Wilson. I'll fight. So, Alf Garnett's fight against bureaucracy has certainly captured the public imagination. At the moment, he is in your actual number 10 Downing Street with your actual Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson and the full cabinet meeting. A meeting we have just learned that your actual Majesty the Queen has insisted on attending. Let me put it this way, your majesty. How would you and Philip like it if he pulled your house down and moved you into a new town? Course you wouldn't. Would you like a toffee, your majesty? They're by appointment. Would you mind? I mean, even Hitler couldn't knock my house down but he's going to. Your darlin' Harold there. I mean, you would have preferred someone more of your own class. I know that. I mean, look at the way he's mucked things up. Too many foreigners. Old Enoch Powell, he's got the right idea. Chuck 'em all out. Especially the black ones. Let me ask you a question, Mr. Prime Minister. How would you like it if old Jenkins next door, number 11, sold his house to a family of coons? Do you mind? Through the chair, please. I know you meet them, your majesty. She shakes hands with them, Her Majesty does. Yeah but I mean, they are like, a different class of coon than you meet, ain't they? They're, sort of, upper class coons, ain't they? Anyway, she keeps her gloves on when she shakes hands with them, don't she? Yeah well, I mean, you can't be too careful can you? I reckon some of them's alright. Oh yeah, some. Hutch is alright. Oh yeah, he's alright. Al Jolson, he was alright too. Al Jolson? Al Jolson wasn't a black, he was white. He was black in Sonny Boy. Shut up you silly. Would you like another toffee, your majesty? Do you know what I mean, another thing your majesty. I mean, look at the way all these Labour lot has give away all your empire. I know just how you feel. The time is right for a change. I mean, the whole country feels that. Oh no, your majesty. I think, in all fairness, it should be offered to Enoch first. I mean, if he turns it down, well give us a ring. You know the phone number, don't ya? Stepney Green one oh nine eight. Oh, your majesty. Thank you. Oh, we didn't expect that. You'll be a Lady now. Will I? Yeah, Lady Else. Thank you. Thank you and I'll be Sir Alfred. Sir Alfred. Sir Alfred Garnett. Sir Alfred Garnett. Sir Alfred. Sir Alfred Garnett. Yes, your majesty. Arise, Sir Alf, or you'll be late for bleedin' work. Come on. I'll tie this lot off then. Yeah. That you, Bert? No, Fred. Fred? Fred Murphy. With the demolition gang. We're knocking down the street so we're using this house to set our huts up. Here, did you have that bird last night? Yeah, of course. Here, have you seen the one next door? She's old four-eyes daughter, ain't she? Get off it, what that ugly old sod? Shut up. Well, it was worse this afternoon. Once or twice, I didn't know where to put my face I didn't. I'll get 'em out of here. Don't you worry. I think we ought to get out of here. Look, I have told you, we are not moving. I'm gonna fight them. Well, I'm not staying here long. I don't mind telling you. I'm going up the pub. Good riddance. Oi, are you blind or something? Oi, where the hell are you going? To the new house. I'm not staying here no longer. What about me? Well, your dinners in the oven. I've left you your chair and the bed upstairs. Ain't it fair eh? Ain't it fair? They've all left me alone, ain't they? Even Him, Him upstairs. He took five bob off me, Win. Done me out of five bob he did. I mean. You know me, Win. I mean, it's not the money. I mean five bob, I don't need five bob. Nor does He. I beg your pardon, Lord. I was only joking. Try them two doors down, they're new. Not today, thank you. Oi, oi. I'm not trying to sell anything, I'm looking for my family. Name of Garnett, have moved in here today. Do you know where... Sorry, never heard of them. Oh, but. Marvellous, innit? Oi, oi. Where you going? We're going the pictures. Well, blimey, wait for me. Nah. I've been looking for you all day, oi. Tarrah, see ya. Well, wait for me. Oi, you waster, hang on. You might have left the bloody address. I didn't think. That's your trouble, innit? Stand still when your Queen is playing.
