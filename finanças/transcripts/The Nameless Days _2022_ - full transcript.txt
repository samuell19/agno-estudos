Anyone there? I can't see shit. It better all be here, asshole, or it's going to cost you your dick. Clear accounts make for long friendships. Bring me the boy. No, no! Hey, Take it easy. Okay. Let's go! Okay. We're almost there. Hey! You two! Hey! Hi. You scared me. Sorry. What are you doing out in this weather? I gotta train. This is crazy though. All this snow. Never seen it like this before. Do you want to come in? I am watching movies and eating processed food. I can't. My dad will send a search party looking for me if I'm not home soon. What the hell does he think is gonna happen to you in Coulter Springs? That my naked, dismembered body will be found scattered down by the border. Cheese puff? So what's up? Um, do you. do you remember my uncle? The one who your dad doesn't like? Yeah. Mm-hm, okay. He said that he could get me into the private school where all my cousins go. In San Diego? He said that I could like stay with him and that he'd pay for my tuition and everything. Holy shit! Wait, he's not a pervert, is he? No. At least I don't think. Well, then, why else would he want you to live with him? Because, um, this school, like, it has one of the best track programs in the country. Something like half the kids that go there get full athletic scholarships. Go! What? I mean, like, not that I want you to leave, but like, you have to go. You gotta get out of here, follow your dreams. It's not that simple. It seems pretty simple to me. What if I go there and I suck? What if I don't even make the team? Well, then you laugh all the way to the beach. Try it now. Yeah, it's-it's the alternator, man. I don't think so. I should know. I was a rallycross driver in Norway for three years. Of course you were. Is there anything you haven't done? Not really. So are you still doing that radio thing? Radio? It's a podcast, man. I just hit 500,000 subscribers last week. Lady! Lady, come here. Hi! You went running in this weather? She's the female Philippides, dude. The-the who? The what? The messenger who ran from the Battle of Marathon to Athens to announce the defeat of the Persians, then collapsed and died. It's where the marathon comes from. - Cool. - Hmm. Well, I hope you weren't running by the border. Just by Caitlin's house. What's up? Damn truck won't start. It's the alternator. It's not the alternator. And you can't tell by smelling it. Yeah, you can. All right, I'm gonna go get cleaned up. See you guys. Hasta la vista. Hang on. Aren't you forgetting something? - Um. - The animals ain't gonna feed themselves. Come on. Come on. You see that? That's my life. Dad! This is what these people bring into our country. More junk. Because if there's one thing we hate around here, it's junk. This is the third one of these we found this year. You almost have to admire their moxie, though. Killing my damn chickens now. Well, you do live on a major migration route. Hey, be careful. There could be a needle in there. Hey. What is that? May I? Well, it appears to be some kind of totemic figure. Well, if these people want to improve their lives, I suggest they start by moving into the 21st century. Clean this up, will ya, Nicole? Greetings, my fellow travelers. It is your man, Wade, broadcasting to you from the Wade Compound deep in the heart of Texas. I gotta be honest with you guys. Right now I've got a real eerie vibe going on tonight. And it all started when a friend of mine found this creepy wild-looking doll some migrants left behind on her property. I sent a picture of it - to my friend Carlos... - You hear that, girl? - who is an afficionado... - We're famous. ...of all things dark and devilish, and he told me it was a cihuateotl. If I'm saying that correctly, it's a type of Aztec demon. Carlos, thanks for coming on, my man. How are you, amigo? Thanks for having me. Okay, so you got to tell my audience what you told me about these cihuateotls. Well, the ancient Aztecs believed that women who died in childbirth would sometimes be transformed into terrifying demons that would come back to Earth periodically to hunt for the thing that they were denied in life. Babies. You gotta hand it to those Aztecs that they knew how to do creepy, right? So why do you think a modern immigrant would be carrying a doll depicting an ancient demon across the border? Uh, for protection, most likely. Cihuateotls were believed to haunt crossroads of border areas specifically... You kept that thing? Why not? It's cool. You didn't check the mail earlier, did you? No. Okay. Well, I'm fixing to make some supper. You want anything? Anything.? I was thinking meatloaf. Or chicken? We had chicken last night. I think we might need to agree on the meaning of the word "anything." Uh, it's Caitlin. You mind? Meatloaf it is. Hi, Uncle Chris. Are we whispering? No, no. Um, uh, what's up? I talked to the headmaster at Eastlake the other day, and he said if we're going to do this thing, there's some paperwork that you'll need to fill out. Oh, okay. Your dad will need to sign off on it too. Oh. Is that a problem? No, no, no, no. Um, not at all. How is he taking the whole idea anyway? Uh, it's fine. Um, better than you'd expect. Well, I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks after all. Anyway, they sent the paperwork out a few days ago. You should be getting it soon. We'll need to get back to them ASAP. Um, I... thank you. Um, I got to go, Uncle Chris. Uh, bye, sorry. Eastlake Academy? This is where Chris's kids go. Dad, we should talk. Talk about what? - No. No. No. - Stay here. Ah. Maybe you should come inside. Why? I like the cold. That way, I can get drunk and sober up, all at the same time. I.I was going to talk to you about it first. I guess you think you're all ready to strike out on your own, then. I did-I didn't say that. But I. I wouldn't be on my own. Mm. Right. Chris never could turn down an opportunity to show me up, but this? No one is trying to show anyone up. He tries to steal my only child away from me without even talking to me about it first. I told him not to say anything to you... so that I could talk to you about it. So, what's his angle? What's he get out of all this? Nothing. He just believes in me. Of course. Guess that's what I've been doing all these years since your mother left, then? Not believing in you. That's not what. He just thinks that I might be able to compete at a higher level and maybe even can get a scholarship. Well, excuse me for not living in a high enough level place. It wasn't high enough for your mother. Why would it be for you? Maybe it wasn't the place that was the problem. I'll tell you what. If you think you're such a star you can go out to California, compete with those big girls, I'll sign these papers. Dad. What? No, I will. I didn't say I was a star. Forget it. Lady, get out! Dad? Is that you? Let me see your hands! Slowly. Who are you? Oh, here we go. There we go. - Uh-huh. - There we go. Nicole. Where were you? What are you doing? He called me and said he needed to talk. While you were out talking, someone broke into our house. Who? I don't know. Give me that. Come on, Lady. Give me that. You-you really think you should be holding a loaded gun in your condition? She's right. You just stay here. Keep the doors and windows locked. Come on, girl. I got him. Wade, come on! I'm coming. Looks like it's trampled down around here. What's that there? Hey. This has got to be where they're coming through. He's got to be long gone by now. Oh shit! Well... ...are you coming? Lady, hey! Lady! No. Get away. Disemboweled. You're sure about that? No. I made it up. I can take you to him. Unfortunately, our jurisdiction ends at the border. There are two men lying dead out there! Out of interest, what exactly were you doing on the Mexican side? I was chasing my dog. What's going on? Who are you? I'm his daughter. And did you see these bodies? What. what bodies? Uh, someone broke into the house when she was here alone. That's why we went to the border in the first place. Do you know who it was? Another border jumper. What did he look like? He was, um, Hispanic, uh, late teens, early 20s. Did he threaten you in any way? No. Actually, he seemed more scared than anything. All right, well, we'll notify the Spanish authorities about the bodies you found, and keep an eye out for your intruder. In the meantime, you might want to be a little careful. Maybe not wander too far from the house for now. For now? When the hell is this going to end? Hey, hey. We're all friends here, man. These guys are just doing their job, all right? Well, I'm not gonna become a prisoner in my own home, in the home where I was born, where my brother is buried. We understand your frustration, Mister Sorenson. The truth is, we had a similar incident reported a couple days ago. Body was found on our side of the fence. It had been eviscerated. So we're just asking you to be a little extra careful. Stay away from the border for the time being. All right. You fellas better up your game and quick, because I'm sick and tired of my property being used as Grand Central for illegals. Do your damn job! Sorry about that. What're you doing? I'm heading up to Midland. Midland? That's like four hours from here. Wade's got a buddy who owns a electronic shop up there. He's going to hook me up some CCTV cameras. I thought the truck was broken. I fixed it. It was the alternator. While I'm out, I want you to stay inside. Keep the doors and windows locked. What am I supposed to do inside all day? I don't know. Watch TV. Knit something. Doors and windows locked. Disemboweled? You mean like-like No. Like Oh. Yikes. Yeah. My dad found them. Creepy. You know, maybe we should all move to San Diego. I'm pretty sure they have murderers in San Diego too. I don't think so. Speaking of which, what did he say? He said I could go if I wanted to. Well, that's great. Isn't it? I don't think I even want to go. I mean, it's one semester; it doesn't even matter. - Okay. - What are you doing? Mm. Pack. Stop. No, come on. You are a freaking genius runner. And you're gonna go to San Diego and prove it. I might be good in Coulter Springs but. it's not really fair to my dad. I knew it. I knew he guilted you. No, he didn't. Okay, he did, but he has a point. My dad stuck with me all those years when my mom bailed out on us. It's not really fair for me to bail on him now. Lady? Let's go. It's all right. It's all right. You. you know this guy? He broke into our house last night while my dad was at the bar. Are you insane? He-he could be the guy who killed those soldiers. He could kill us. It's all right. It's all right. Okay, that's it. I'm calling my dad. No, don't. Okay, well, then you call your dad. Definitely not. I can't get in trouble for this. Don't tell anyone. Caitlin! Here, it's okay. My father found two Mexican soldiers murdered last night. I didn't kill them. I believe you. Sorry. Well, that should be good for now, but you should really go to a hospital. No. No hospital. I-I know that you don't want to get in trouble, but... My sister is still out there. Across the border? Is-is she hurt? No. No hurt. She's. .embarazada. She has a baby in her belly. She's pregnant? Si. Si. Pregnant. What were you doing bringing a pregnant girl across the border? Never mind. Um, who did this to you? You won't believe me if I tell you. There is a myth in my country about women who come back from the death to steal babies. Shut up! Where'd you get this? We found it in our shed. This is Coaxoch, Serpent Flower. She was a beautiful woman who was sacrificed with her unborn baby by the Aztec king Montezuma. There's a legend among people near here that she comes back as a cihuateotl to haunt the border. This is all I could find. All my exes live in Texas? Uh, I've. I was just noticing your necklace. My mother gave it to me before we came up north. It's Saint Christopher. Patron saint of travelers. What's he carrying? A child. Fits perfectly. You're a local now. What are those? Oh, nothing. That's just, um, I, I run track. You must be very good at it. I guess. I mean, there's not really much competition out here. My mother's people run too. They do? It started as a way of sending messages between the villages. Now it's just a tradition. So cool. I guess we have something in common. Oh, shit. It's my dad. Stay here and be quiet. Dad! Here, here let me help you. Why don't you take those? Yeah. Of course. Take those. These are for me. Lady, it's just me. You got the cameras. I got them. Next time anyone gets near this place, we'll have a record of it. That's great. What's wrong with her? Nothing. What did you do all day? Knitted a sweater. Caitlin came over. You want some jerky? It's your favorite. Um, no, I'm fine. I'm not feeling that well. I think I'm actually gonna go to bed soon. What about apology pizza? Lady. What is with that dog? Dad! What's going on in here? Nothing. Dad! That is my room. It's a boundary. We talked about this. Yeah. Well, we don't get to have those when people get killed near our house. Nicole, I told you to keep these windows shut. Are you all right? I said I'm not feeling well. Maybe you should eat something. Dad, I'm not feeling well. Oh. All right. Sorry. Hope you feel better. Rahui, is that you? You're bleeding again. We need to get out of here. - I need to find Gabriela. - No. You're not gonna find anyone like this. - I need to find her. - No. I know someone who can help us and then we can find her, okay? We can take my dad's truck. Come on. It's gonna be okay. That is one mean manhole somebody poked in you, buddy. Who did it? You know to use one of these? I know you do. You said the soldier shot at that thing, right? Many times. I don't think guns are gonna get it done. She's right. My friend Carlos, he'll know what to do. Ugh, voicemail. Carlos, I know it's late, man, but we got to talk. It's important. On my way. You two, stay here until I get back. Hey, girl. - Wade. - Hey. You gotta talk to me about these cihuateotls. Now? Now. Jessie. Are you okay? Five days? Are you sure about that? That's what the legend says. The cihuateotls can only return to Earth during those five days the Aztec call The Nameless Days. And so what happens after the five days are up? Good question. Look, border patrol said they found another eviscerated body a couple of days before we found those dead Mexican soldiers. That's good news. Not that they found another body but that this might almost be over. How would one go about getting rid of one of these things before the five days is up, if you had to? You don't. You can't kill something that's already dead. You just got to run.hide. try to outlast the suckers. It's here. Right up. Let's go. Are you okay? Just stay here. I'll go get her. Gabriela. Gabriela. It's okay. I'm here to help you. I'm with Rahui. Gabriela. What is it? Run! Just run! Nicole! What happened? Rahui, we need to go. I can't. Come on. Hey. Nicole. Nicole. Nicole! Excuse us for a second. An Aztec demon? She's looking for babies. Are you on something? - Who are these.? - Listen to me! She's the one who's cutting the stomachs. No, that's the cartels... No, Dad. No. I saw it. Dad. I never told you how your Uncle Nicholas died, did I? No. He was. murdered. He-he was cut. In the stomach? We were down playing by the border and I left, and he never came home. I was the one who found him. Almost rolled over him on my bike, and he had been. he'd been gutted like an animal. I still can't get that image out of my head. Come on. Pick up the call. This is great. What the hell? You think that thing followed you? I don't know. I pushed it down a mineshaft or something. It seemed pretty deep. A mineshaft? They are plenty deep. Halfway to hell. Least, that was my experience. You-you were a miner? Nah. A grunt. But I'll tell you what, working in that mine bought you a hell of a lot more diapers than my rodeo career ever would have. I heard you were pretty good. Where'd you hear that? Mom. Oh. Look. Nicole. I've never been an easy guy to talk to, to live with. One thing I always have been is, uh, a man of my word. so. Like I said I would. Thanks. I want you to be happy. Oh, hi. Caitlin. What are you doing here? Sorry, you weren't answering your phone. Am I interrupting? No. Oh, uh, I'll, I'll wait in the other room. It's.it's nice to see you, Caitlin. Is this a bad time? No. Um, you just scared us. So what's up? Okay, I had an epiphany. Okay. What if we go to San Diego together? W-what? I mean, I have some money saved up. And what do I love more than anything in the world? TV and movies. And where do they make TV and movies? Not in Coulter Springs. So I figure you and I could go to California and pursue our dreams together. What do you think? What about school? What about it? It's not like I'm learning anything, so. Can we talk about it later? Oh, okay. But I'm not leaving here until you tell me that there is, like, a chance you'll say yes. Okay. Okay what? There's a chance I'll say yes. Okay, I knew you would. Okay, I have to go to my aunt's wedding in Lubbock tomorrow, but I will call you from the road because it's going to be boring. Um, Caitlin? What? Maybe you should just lock all your doors and windows and stay inside tonight. Okay, Grandma. Oh, oh, cuz of the... Oh, how would I ever survive in this world without you, Nikki Sorenson? You're useless. I know. Bye. Bye. That was just my friend Caitlin. Keep the baby quiet. Nicole, don't. Oh, honey. Don't, don't. Honey, no, no, no, no, no. Don't look. - Don't look, honey. No. - No! No! - Don't! Don't. No. - No! Don't, don't look, honey. Honey, honey, don't. There's a crawlspace that leads outside. If it gets in, we can get out that way and get to the truck. Come on, honey. Go. Go. Come on! Inside. Inside. No, no. Dad! Hey, girl. Hey. You stay here. Guard the castle. Keep everyone safe, okay? I need to get my dad. Dad. Dad. Dad, let's go. Come on. Come on. We have to go! We have to go! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm so sorry. You need to go. No. You're gonna be okay. You need to get them out of here. You need to. you need to save that little baby. Leave. You can do anything. You can go. Get in! The oil pan is punctured. What is that? It's metal epoxy. I think we might be able to patch it up with this. How long would that take? Maybe ten minutes to set but 24 hours for it to fully cure. We don't have 24 hours. If we heat it up, and then we cover it in duct tape, it might hold long enough for us to get to safety. We can try. Please. All right, let's do it. No! No! No! What is it? No! No! No! No! Go! Gabriela! Ah! Back off! Back off! Or I'll slit his throat. I'll do it! Get back. I'll do it! Back off. Tie her to me. Do it! Get the truck fixed. We meet at Wade's. Wade! Wade! Nicole.
