This was the beginning of everything... The first gods to be born were: Amano Minakanushi, Takami Musuhi, and Kami Musuhi. The next gods to be born were: Umashi Ashikabi Hikoji and Amano Tokotachi. Then came a pair of gods, Izanagi and Izanami. They created the Japanese archipelago. Since then, many thousands of years have passed. Oh, my God! But he is still far off. How many years will it take? What is that? That year, twin princes were born in Yamato. The second-born baby was named Ousu, later renamed Yamato Takeru. OROCHI, THE EIGHT-HEADED DRAGON Hijiri Palace Since ancient times, twins have often brought misfortune. The later twin especially has often been a devil in disguise. Tsuki now a... What father would hate his child? But I can't help but hate the younger of the princes. Where does this hate come from? It comes from instinct. It is a sign of divine guidance. Forgive me. Where are you taking the child? It is the Emperor's order. Where are you taking the child? It is the Emperor's order. Bringer of misfortune, begone! Ise Shrine This is Yamato's... So, until you give your pardon to him, I will rear the prince at my shrine. No! I forbid it! The one who carried the boy to me was Amaterasu's messenger, the White Bird of Heaven. Dare you turn your sword against the goddess, my brother? Princess Yamato, thank you very much. Who is he? The psychic Tsukinowa. I don't know where he is from. His prayer once brought rain. That won him the Emperor's trust. Ten years later Izanagi, the god who created this country, begat the three most important gods: To Amaterasu he gave the heavens. To Tsukuyomi he gave the underworld. And to Susano-o he gave the sea. I give up. Were you trying to go to the cave? I've told you many times not to go there. The world inside that cave is not normal. You must never go near it again. Are you the one who dares interfere with my sleep? Who are you? You don't need to be scared. Ousu, I've been waiting for you. You will someday come to possess three lights. Then you will become a warrior of the gods. A warrior of the gods? Someday we will meet again. He has awakened. Prince! Good news! You've received a pardon from the Emperor! What's the matter? This should be a wonderful day for you. I can feel a mysterious power in your jewel. I'm sure that it will protect you. I hope you will be kind to your mother. Understand? Be patient for a while. O, Sword of Dark Clouds! Our master will soon return. Before he comes, I must get rid of that bringer of misfortune. You've made trouble as soon as you returned. Why are you so violent toward Tsukinowa? I don't know what happened myself. Nonsense! Your mother's only wish was to have you back. Be grateful to her. From this day forth you too will be a prince of Yamato. Learn from your brother, and do not disgrace me. Yes, Sir! Why bring him to Yamato? It would be best if nothing terrible happened, but... Mother! Is that you, Ousu? I hear that you are sick. How are you? I'm fine. I will be better soon. My, how beautiful. I heard that it was your favorite flower. That's right. This is my charm. I'm certain it will protect you as well. You are a kind child, aren't you? Prince! Your mother has just passed... Ousu? Where is Ousu?! You cursed our mother into death! You evil spirit! Die! What?! Are you saying that Ousu killed his brother? He killed his mother first, then his brother. What a devil he... Say no more! What a devil he... Say no more! I have made my decision! Go west to the country of Kumaso immediately. The barbarians there are hostile to us. Kill their chief and make them obedient to us. Do not return before you accomplish this task! Seiryu! Genbu! Well, well, young traveler! We too are going to Kumaso. It is still a long journey. Let us have lunch here. Aunt! Please protect Prince Ousu on his journey. Somebody is waiting for you ahead. You are destined to meet. This somebody will share your life. This shrine must be related to Ise Shrine. Let's take a break here. Right. Let's take a break here. Right. Don't touch it without being purified! Was this your doing?! You even practice magic? Wait! Forgive my sister. We are not suspicious people. We come from Ise Shrine. This is Prince Ousu of Yamato. A prince?! Actually, just before you came, our shrine's precious treasure, the Mirror of the White Bird, suddenly disappeared. And so you thought us to be the thieves? Yes, I'm very sorry. The emblem of the White Bird means this must be a respectable shrine. We have a legend that goes with the mirror which has been passed down from ancient times. What legend? Which has been passed down from ancient times. What legend? "When this world is consumed by darkness, the White Bird of Heaven will take the form of a warrior of light and save the people of the world. " The White Bird will take the form of a warrior? Yes! What's wrong, Oto? I'm afraid. I feel like I've been waiting for him. Since long ago... Maybe since before I was born. Probably... For him... What is that? Dressed like a warrior! This is Amaterasu's battle costume, passed down in our shrine. Please take me with you. Once we get over those mountains, we'll finally be in Kumaso. This man has given us food. We're very grateful. I'm the one who should be grateful. The one going to the festival for the God of Kumaso to serve Kumaso Takeru at his castle in place of my daughter, would that be you? Seiryu! Well, that's what's going on. The palace of Kumaso? After the offerings to the God of Kumaso, the dancers will gather for a party. No man but Kumaso Takeru can enter. No weapons are allowed inside. Allright, you may pass. Allright, you may pass. The chief is here! You... And one more. You! That sound? O God of Kumaso, this is your sacrifice. So you're not just a dancer. Whose spy are you? This girl is a fighter. I would have liked to enjoy that a bit longer. O great God of Kumaso! Accept our offering! I see. You thought this through well. Young woman there! No, man. So you've revealed yourself. What country are you from? I'm the second prince of Yamato. Ousu! Yamato? Ousu! Yamato? You have courage. But not wisdom. How will you fight with no sword? You seem to have wisdom as well. Now you just need strength. It's been a while since I've had a difficult opponent. You said your name was Ousu? Brave man of Yamato, I name you Yamato Takeru. Yamato Takeru? Allright! I will accept it as the last will of Kumaso Takeru. Don't make me laugh. I'm telling you what name I'll inscribe on your tomb. You're a strong man. Kumaso Takeru, you too are strong. Where is Oto Tachibana? That girl? She's... That's the God of Kumaso? Oto! Prince! Watch out! Seiryu! It's coming! The White Bird of Heaven! The shrine's mirror! You will someday come to possess three lights. Three... ...lights. But why was the shrine's mirror here? It must have been the divine guidance of Amaterasu. The Mirror of the White Bird has been waiting for you. That jewel has a mysterious power. A monster is living within me. Strange things have happened to me before, without my knowing. But this time was different. I wanted my self to become a monster. I owe you both. Because of your help, I was able to kill Kumaso Takeru. Let us meet again. Thank you. I have returned. I hear that you killed Kumaso Takeru? Yes, Sir. You call yourself Yamato Takeru? Yes, Sir. You call yourself Yamato Takeru? It sounds strong. It suits you. Don't be proud! Though you killed Kumaso, I still won't forgive you! Five more days... This is... Amaterasu's fire! Stop the evil air! Genbu, where are you going? Aunt! I have a request to make. I want you to deliver the sacred Sword of Dark Clouds, which lies in the imperial court, to my shrine. The sacred sword? As soon as possible. But why? Tsukuyomi is returning. He envied Amaterasu and her established central position, and so transformed himself into the eight-headed dragon Orochi, and tried to destroy the Earth. Then, Susano-o, who is also the god of war, came forward and defeated the dragon. Susano-o found a sword in its body, the Sword of Dark Clouds. It is the symbol of Tsukuyomi's power. His father, Izanagi, afraid of Tsukuyomi's evil mind, locked Tsukuyomi in ice and sent him into outer space. And this Tsukuyomi is coming back? If he gets the sword... The world will be in danger of destruction again. The sword can only be sealed by the power of Amaterasu at my shrine. We must protect the sword. Will you do it? That is... The Sword of the Dark Clouds! There is a reason for this. Please forgive me! Stealing the sacred sword... Follow him! Oto! What is that? This is the flower that my mother loved. She died because of me. Not just her... ...my brother as well. No! ... my brother as well. No! It's true! It's true! I am a cursed prince! Why was this unwanted prince born?! For what purpose was I put in this world? Your power also saved my life before. That is a power of justice. Let's take a ship to Ise. It's a longer but safer route. You... Why do you want to follow me? Because it is my destiny. What is this? This weather has something behind it! Prince! Prince! For him... ...I will die. Oto! Oto! Oto! Mother... Mother! Foolish boy! Be happy though. Even if it was just an illusion, you were able to see your mother! Now I'll send you to Hell just like your mother! So... You killed her?! Yes, I cursed and killed her. Not just your mother, I killed your brother as well! That was you?! That coward! I finished him off. Has something happened to the prince? I'm worried about the prince as well, but Tsukuyomi's power is growing stronger quickly. Oh, my God! The sun is darkening. Oh, my master! O Tsukuyomi! Who is it? The one who was born from you. Born from me? When, Susano-o defeated you, one of your fangs broke off. I welcome you back! I have returned. Izanagi, my father who expelled me... Amaterasu of the heavens... I will show you both that the day of Tsukuyomi has come! Bring me my sword! My sword! My power... My power is returning to me! I've been waiting. I am Bull-Head, the Great King of the underworld! The underworld? I will test you to see if you are the one that I want. Will you die and become my servant, Yamato Takeru? King Bull-Head! I am also known as Susano-o. O, God Susano-o! Yamato Takeru... You have a great task that you must complete. You were born to kill Tsukuyomi. Kill Tsukuyomi? My father sent you to Earth for that purpose. That is the Sword of Karasai. It is the only sword that can defeat Tsukuyomi. This is... The second light! Do not hate your father, the Emperor. Everything was planned to make you into a hero. It was arranged by my father, Izanagi. The Emperor did not know. After many divine tests, you have gained the Wild Spirit. Wild Spirit? It is that power you fear and call the monster within yourself. Only he who has the Wild Spirit can kill Tsukuyomi. Can I... Do you think I can kill a god? The two of you can. Two of us? Touch the coffin with your sword. Two of us? Touch the coffin with your sword. Oto! Prince! Oto Tachibana... The spirit of Amaterasu is within you. The goddess? And my spirit is within you, Prince Ousu. You were both born into this world on the same day, at the same time. You share the same destiny. Now, go forth. Defeat Tsukuyomi, and restore light to the world. Who are you? Yamato Takeru! Oto Tachibana! A gift from my father? How can you humans overcome me, a god? That is Susano-o's... The Sword of Karasai! Interesting, let's see how strong you are. That's enough playing around with you two. The Eight-Headed Dragon! I'm... I'm fainting. Oto! My hand... Take my hand... Oto! You have been chosen by the gods. You will someday possess three lights. Then you will become a warrior of the gods. Three lights! Oto! It's all like a d ream. He's still alive! Well done! Thanks to you, the world has been saved. Tsukuyomi is still alive! Seal him into your jewel. Into my jewel? Throw it into the sky with all of your might. If he's an evil god, why not kill him? Next time he returns, he will bring happiness to mankind. Gods are like that. Look! The light! I can feel Ousu. Ousu... I want to see Ousu. Prince... That was you, wasn't it? What a warm light!
