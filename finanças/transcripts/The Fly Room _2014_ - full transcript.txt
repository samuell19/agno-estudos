I didn't want to be like him. I didn't want to... be like him at all. He was always very kind of boyish. He was not socialized. I would not say. He had never really... been into small talk. It horrified me. It horrified me, to see... That... That dark... room. And the light that he worked under was... just a very small patch. Whether it was my mother that called or... or, um... ...someone... ...from... Columbia. I have no idea. I just got the message that my father had died. Smile! Good. I forgot my Brownie box. Where is it? Upstairs? We built all the stuff that you like to build. - C'mon Hermann! - I'm standing on a sharp rock! Wow. It's lovely. Great. What do we've here? 3L? This is '9E14'. This is the 'btx'. Right. So that's a deficiency gap so... That band was completely missing from... - Do you know what a whale shark is? - Yes, they kill sharks. ...when you dissect the salivary gland. Yeah, you do understand that essentially what this means is that it's spontaneous? There is massive gap here between 51, 52, 53. Actually a bit down further too. That's fascinating. Phil! Phil! Hey. ♪ Fair are the meadows, Fair are the woodlands, ♪ Robed in flowers of blooming spring. ♪ Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer. ♪ Robed in flowers of blooming spring. ♪ Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer. ♪ He makes our sorrowing spirit sing. Tilt up. Tilt the camera up. Betsey, I want the trees... Tilt it up! - Take off your hat. - Hang on. I was going to take off my hat. Settle down. C'mon. You've got lead feet, c'mon. - Doctor Bridges! - Doctor Wilson. Betsey, hurry up. C'mon. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Calvin Bridges' daughter and I'm coming to visit his work. Welcome, c'mon in. Have you ever seen inside of a frog before? No. This is what it looks like, you see? I just opened it up here, - ...and you can see what's inside. - Betsey! Betsey c'mon! - I have to go. - Alright. Have a good day. - You too. - It was a pleasure meeting you. Pleasure. Enjoy your frogs! 'I1' is fine. There is an extraordinary amount of red flies here. Don't touch anything. Don't move anything. No talking to anyone while they are working. And especially, no photographs in the lab. - But that's why I brought my camera for. - Betsey! Yes? - Hello, Morgan. - Calvin. Betsey. - Hello, Professor Morgan. - Well, hello Betsey. Gertrude sends her thanks - for helping today. - Of course, my pleasure. Now how is your dear mother? She has trouble walking up at the stairs and... now I have to carry Nate. Morning Doctor Bridges. So nice of you to join us. How is mapping the first chromosome, Doctor Sturtevant? Would it be ready by the end of 1927? That all depends on whether you get me the most recent recombination frequency numbers, Doctor Bridges. Solche kinder... This one got a funny little right wing. One of yours Hermann? Maybe I will call it 'i1' after Igor. What do you think? You see it starts as an egg, and then becomes a larva, and then finally a pupa, and then of course once again the adult fly. - I'm sorry. - Oops! No that's ok. No harm. Now, I have something that I'm quite sure will interest you. Have a seat there. I think you're going to really... like this... Madame et Monsieur, le paradis. Come in, please. Edith. Betsey, I'd like you to meet Miss Wallace. Come with me, dear. Do we need a number on this, does it matter? We are calling it 't1'. One of mine, terrific. One of yours? No, it's one of mine. Did you make all of these drawings? They're very good. Thank you. - May I have some paper please? - Of course. That's very beautiful. Very, very beautiful. There you are. What's that?! That is the 'Vitruvian Man' by Leonardo Da Vinci. But he's naked. No. He's not naked. He's nude... And there's nothing wrong with the naked body in the context of great art. Have you ever seen a naked man, Miss Wallace? A few. I've only ever seen my brothers' naked. They look very silly without clothes. Not bad, Calvin. One of these days that vial will break. Let's hope so. - Miss Wallace? - Yes? How do you make the eyes on the flies look real? Well, inside the fly eyes are hundreds of repeating shapes, and you may want to color in those shapes different shades of red. Well, of course, running around the banana... Ha ha. Right. Did I tell you about the 'Canton-S' strain? - How I named it? - No, not quite. You know, I captured that strain in canton Ohio, hence the name... Guess what the 'S' is for? Sarah. - Sarah? - Sarah. Who's Sarah? Special Sarah. Yes, she is. She's a special gal. Her vagina was so large... my god man but the way she could work it. Anyway... You know they are three... I like red. Red is a beautiful color. And while I was waiting, they had a bowl of fruit they served to their guests. There was, I believe, three bananas, and surrounding the bananas were these wild flies, the 'Canton-S'. Well. This excited me. I followed my impulse, I grabbed the fly, I put it in a vial that I had in my sock... while I danced with Sarah for the next hour and a half. The flies! In your socks? Let me introduce you. This is Betsey. Betsey, Meredith. And that's baby Edward over there. Getting comfortable... What have we there, baby Edward? A good smile anyway. You just look wonderful Lillian. Have we eaten yet? We have not eaten. Well, we must all be hungry. Let's see what's in here for us to eat, shall we? Can you open your mouth a little bit larger? Here it comes, here it comes. Wah... What are you thinking about? Listening to the cicadas. What were you doing 17 years ago? Not thinking that I would come up for... four weeks to the surface of the earth and then pass away. Could you spend 17 years underground? I think perhaps I already have. Mutations can either be mistakes, or they can lead to improvements in how the body works. Look at the earthworms that I found at the park today. My! - Aren't they beautiful. - Yes. I'm going to give them some dirt to eat. And do they have names? Yes, that's Billy, Barbara and Buster. - They're very beautiful creatures. - Yes. Does anyone study... earthworms like... ...like you study flies? Well, one can study mutations in insects... - ... Barbara! - ...earthworms... ...humans... ...plants, trees... really anything. Could you get Billy off of my drawing, please? - I'm sorry! - Thank you so much. It's good you remembered it was Billy. I know, I don't want to mix up your friends. I think you're Billy... How do you tell if a worm is a boy or a girl? That is a very good question. I think you should ask your father about that. One day... scientists that is... Yeah... Well. This one's had a rough night. Why is wrong with it? Don't tempt fate, Hermann. - Say, hello there! - Hello, Mister Muller. - How are you, Betsey? - Good. Good. - And you? - I'm doing just fine, thank you. What are you doing here, Betsey? Spending the day with you like mother said. That's my desk. Go back with Edith. That's not what mother said I should do. Well your mother is not here, is she? Go back to Edith. I'm going to tell her what you said. Quite an unruly child. Be careful Sturt, she'll take your job! 90, 91... I am getting no females in this batch. After tomorrow, I want to hear nothing more about it. Why? What? Go to sleep. I love you mommy. I love you sweetie. God bless you. What does it matter?! You have to help me on this one, the doctor said not to move, I have to stay in bed. She wants to play, she wants to get into things. - She... - You are going to have to take her again, - and show her... - It's no place for a little girl. - Betsey does not need to see what... - For Christ sake, quiet down Calvin! Don't tell me to be quiet! Jesus fucking Christ! You know, there's nothing quite like... starting up your morning by... wiping three-week old banana goo off milk bottles. How many do you have left to clean? Endless supply, endless... Can I help you? This is no task for a fine lady like yourself. I don't mind. Ok well, you need this. There you go. A lot of fun, right? You know your father actually... designed a new type of bottle. Square bottom... prevents it from rattling around in the crates when we transport them. He also invented an improved fly food recipe that doesn't spoil as quickly. But he doesn't want to share it with the rest of us. I told you Hermann. The secret is molasses. - Unsulfured. - I'm sorry... Just wipe... And I'm done. - And faster than you. - But less thorough. And that's where the real artistry of this job lies young Betsey. So, this yellow fly here, has long hair on its back, antennae as long as its face... and also long eyelashes. And white eyes. We call this fly 'sternopleural'. Doesn't it look like your father? Yes, it does look a bit like him. And the smaller version of the same fly would be you. I don't look anything like him. I look like my mother. Muller? What's the latest on the sex ratios of the last cross? About... three to one ratio, male to female. I counted... 321 males to 96 females. Mister Muller? I'd marry you when I grow up probably... ...though you already have a wife. Well, if I didn't have a wife... I think I would accept. - Well. Are you taking pictures? - Yes. Um... Perhaps maybe you can get my left side. I seem to prefer it over my right. I think you look fine either way. Well... Thank you. - Smile. - I... I'm smiling. Both sides. What are you doing? Well... I'm calculating crossing­over frequencies to determine the distance between genes on a chromosome. Can I take a picture of your crossword puzzle? No. These snapshots are disturbing us. Go away. Yesterday Miss Wallace told me you can't see colors. Well, Miss Wallace is wrong, I can see certain colors. Why only certain? Well that's... that's the way I was born. Why do you have two hands? Why are your eyes blue? Why is your hair the color that it is? Why are some people tall... and some people short? Just the way we're born. And, what determines those characteristics... is exactly what we're trying to study right now. Can you see the red eyes in the flies? Or does my daddy have to tell you that they're red? No. No, I can see just fine. I collect all the... data... about the different kinds of flies I see. Why don't you go and ask your father about his totem pole. That drawing you were showing me earlier... - Yes. - I was looking at it... This is the bithorax mutant. ­hum. It's quite amazing. A second pair of wings, a second stomach and completely duplicated thoracic features. I never noticed that the duplication of the second thoracic segment lead to a loss of the halteres. Betsey? Word is: it's going to be wild tonight. Are these bithorax flies? Yes, they are... Is it caused by a mutation? Why, yes it is... During development, there's a... duplication of one of the body segments. Unh, hn, hn... What happens... is a fly has little fat arms known as halteres... But the bithorax changes those little fat arms... ...into wings. The added weight of the fly, in the absence of the halteres... ...restrict... ...the most beautiful mutant... we have... from actually flying. Can I look inside? Sure, one moment. Don't touch that. It's an expensive object, not a toy. Go ahead. Don't squint. I'm not squinting. Pretend you're looking through. Like this. They're real. Umm... - Can you see the dark spot? - Yes. That's... the meconium. The meconium... is... a dark spot that indicates that the fly is a virgin. What does that mean? Hey Alfred, you know all about that... Why don't you tell Betsey what a virgin is? Ha, Ha, Ha... How should I put this? A virgin is... ...a young female... ...who has not yet been touched by male. Are they dead? They keep twitching. They're having nightmares. This is your stock over here. Yeah. Here you go. Some ether... ...put those little fellows to sleep. Fifteen hundred flies quite sufficient, but 18 percent for 'bpr' recombination is low. So lots of variability. Since you have 'ho no' in the left end of two that resembles 'ho'... Probably... a new locus. Sweetie, I think you went a bit too far with the ether. Those fellows are going to be asleep for a very... long time. How long? Possibly eternity. Uhmm. Here's... here's what you do. A quick dunk onto cotton like so... That's all they need... to be all nice, relaxed and happy. What's a three letter word for... Fly. Ass. Classy. On the 89th, it's the 89th factor for the bithorax. - That's incredible. - On the first T2. I think we almost have enough data to put a pin in there. Bill, I'd like to introduce you to my colleagues. Mister William Pallie, this is Doctor Bridges, Doctor Sturtevant. Bill is here on assignment from 'Popular Science'. I've been explaining to Bill about your outstanding work on the life chart. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. So, this is the world's famous life chart? Yes! Well, we like to call it the totem pole. Hermann, I found a virgin! Betsey, enough chatter. Would you excuse me, gentlemen? Yes, this is the totem pole of the... ...hereditary-controlling genes. Each panel... ...represents a different chromosome of the fruit fly. Each pin... is a gene. We can see the distance between genes on the same chromosome, and that way understand their interaction. Are you able to design new genes? Well, not yet. But soon, we may be able to select for specific traits. We... we can only understand how factors, genes recombine... in insects. We can't play god. Yes, this is not about eugenics. We're not improving on nature, but rather we're trying to understand the basic laws that determine who we are. Precisely. Have you boys been following the John Scopes trial? It is ludicrous to think that teaching evolution is anti-religious. Same goes for the study of genes? Well, yes, of course, without genes, the basic... mechanisms of evolution cannot operate. 'Cannot...' '...operate...' Well, gentlemen, this has been very interesting. Thank you very much... I'll follow up with any further questions. Sure thing, Mister Pallie. And Godspeed to you. Thank you. Next time we will tell him how we discovered the God gene. Then people would accuse us of trying to eliminate God. Or... trying to mutate him. Edith? - Yes? - I wanted to show you this. What I saw... Bithorax is on the 89th... ...position. - What do you think? - It's great. It's beautiful work. Betsey, how tall are you? Close to... five feet. Are you sure? Come here. Come up here. Now, I want you to lean back, I've got you. Lean back. A chromosome is like a house. Each gene is a family member. There's... 'jaunty', 'yellow', 'forked', 'vermillion', and... 'Betsey'. They all live on the X chromosome. - What's X? - What's X? Well, X is a sex chromosome. Two Xs' and you become a girl. An X and a Y chromosome, you become a boy like me. Can I have my picture taken next to the totem pole? Sure. - Hey Jack? - Yes? Come over here, will ya'? C'mon. Okay... - Thank you, Jack. - Thank you. - One more. - Sure. Come here. Now... you see that? ...clump of bushes over there. - Yes. - That will be our focal point. What we're going to do is we're going to capture this entire scene in a photograph. Can you do that with one? - No. - No. How are we going to do that? I don't know. Take one picture. Move it left... three degrees. Stay still. Listen here. You have to be very careful. When you take these photos... take a deep breath in, hold your breath as you snap the photo. Between your movements, go three degrees, then you can breath in and out, take another deep breath, set your photo, take a picture. Do you understand? - Yes. - Okay. Jack? - Henry? - Yes, sir? Would one of you fellows like to tell me about... the... stock of the white mutation? Do you need some more? Would you consider it a vital stock? Yes, of course. Great. What color are their eyes? White. - Sorry. What was that? - White. White. That's right. And, why are their eyes white instead of... let's say... I don't know... red for example? Calvin. Why must you be so condescending with the boys. Sturt. Who said I was being condescending? Yes? Recessive mutation of the white gene causes white eyes, sir. Who prepared this last batch? I did sir. Jack... ...would you come here for a moment? Look through the microscope. What do you see? I see... white eyes. Aha. What else? There's a red one in there too. There's a red one... there's a... yes. Do you see what the fucking problem is, Jack? I... No? What? - I don't... I don't... - They're contaminated. They're fucking contaminated, Jack! Let me see... Sturt, go back to your desk! What do you want to see?! You're fuckin' colorblind! You! Step one... we start with soap. We get rid of all the flies. What do you see? Do you see a fly? Do you see fly? - No, no flies sir. - No, you don't. No, you don't. Step two, we place the bottle upside down, like that! Not right side up, upside down. Do you understand the difference? - Yes, sir. - What's the difference? Why do we do that? - Because of the flies... - Because of the flies! Back to work you both fucking idiots! Goddamn useless! This fucking child here could do better than you! Okay, quiet down boys. Doctor Bridges, we wanted to... apologize to you again for the mistake we made earlier. That's fine. It's a possibility that I overreacted... a bit. And um... I just wanted to take this opportunity to... congratulate Miss Bridges on her new job. Thank you. Jack. Yes sir? I know it's Friday evening... ...but you boys behave. Come back to us in one piece on Monday. Thank you sir. Betsey? You have that vial of virgins? Okay... Now that we have isolated... how many? - Fifty-five. - Fifty-five... It's time to invite some boys to the party at a ratio of five to one. So that's about ten males. Now, make sure they're tapped down and... 'Man, we're lonely...' What? Did you hear that? 'Yes, so lonely.' Sweetheart, will you hold this vial for me? Let's get some males here. And now it's time... ...for the fruit fly dance. Uhm! First name... 'Drosophila'. Last name... 'Melanogaster'. Now what? Well, the male stands directly in front of the female. Eye to eye. And then... starts to... ...flap his wing. But be careful, just one wing. Why only one wing? Because it's sexier that way. Look at that... those beautiful patterns and those veins... Do you hear that? No. I hear it. I don't know what's wrong with you Betsey. My wing is flapping so fast... ...that it vibrates! And then the next step happens very quickly. The male circles the female... ...four times... Not five! Four! And then he grabs the female who cannot resist such a... beautiful male. And that, my dear, is the fruit fly dance. You're leaving already, Hermann. My better half is calling me. You're gonna miss the best part. Well, next time. - This one's a hot number. - Good work! Betsey, Calvin. Good evening Hermann. Tschüss! Put your hand on my shoulder, like that. There you go. Now, step onto my feet. You know what, you're a natural. Let's... We're gonna get fancy, are you ready? Here you go. Follow me. Yes! You are a born dancer. You know what mama said about Grandmother Bridges? Well, I can only imagine. She said... ...she lived so long because she was so mean. Aha... She raised me the best she could. The old goat lived a very hard life. Why? Why? Well... She had a very mean father. And he didn't mind hitting her. Now... Grandma Bridges was a... ...she was an adult when she was your age. She was working ten, twelve hours a day... ...at a dairy farm... ...making her own living. Well, wasn't long before... ...she met Grandpa. Now they were married when they were fourteen years old. He was fifteen. Married already? Now we can't imagine such a thing... ...at this time, can we? But that's right. It's a complicated thing, ain't it? So let's not hold it against Grandma. Were you sad not never knowing your parents? Well... I suppose I was... But you know... I may not have known them but... I knew them for what they gave me. What did they give you? Well, they gave me... this nose... They gave me these ears... They gave me this hair... Just like I gave you... my eyes... ...and my eyesight. - Really? - Yeah. Well it sure wasn't your mother, she's as blind as a bat. - No she isn't! - Hey now... ...looks like someone also got my temper. You're right though, sometimes she sees right through me. Hey! What do you say we put these new dance steps to some use? I am... ...an albatroooos tonight... ...flying through the sky... ...eating up all the little buggies from the ground. Hellooo... What's with the mustache? It's a costume party, Bobby I know that. Your football jersey hardly counts as a costume. What's the password? Prohibition's over, haven't you heard? Man... According to 'Popular Science'... '...the eyes of the World's Fair are on the future...' 'The world of tomorrow... starts tomorrow.' - Theo? - Yes my dear? I hear that you're working on a new piece about memory. Well it sounds fascinating, the project. You're enjoying the work? Well you know, memory is... something that is very fluid and dynamic. Theo, Djuna? This is my daughter Betsey. Betsey. Djuna, Theo. - Hello Betsey. - Hello. I would swear that you never leave this place! Funny, I was thinking the same thing about you. Betsey, have a seat. - How was Paris? - Marvelous. I'm returning in a few days. I just called in on a story assignment for 'Pulp Magazine'. You did? Hi Edna. Get over here. Come here. Sit down. This is my daughter Betsey. You must be bored out of your mind. I didn't know you had a daughter. - Now you know. - How old are you? Ten. A little young to be hanging out with this crowd. Knowing them they might be here a while. She's wise beyond her years. - Really. - Hum. Then come with me. You two are getting along well. She's been in the lab all day. It's been an experience, I'll say that much. Charles, say hello. I'm... Charlie. Not Charles. You want some? Come here. Are you smoking? What are you... a man? Look at me. Be good. You too. Tell me have you been able to show that genes control our sexual desires yet? Not yet. But I'm working on it and as soon as I do, sweetheart, you'll be the first to know. The idea is that, not only do factors, or genes, as you might say, affect what color your... your nose comes out as, or your ears, but also in the way you speak... - Really? - And the ideas you have, and the behavior you exhibit. - Fascinating. - For instance, right now... So what I'm doing right now is determined by my genes? The way you're crossing your legs, the way you're crossing your arms. It's not only determined by genes also of course your environment, but genes play an incredible factor... one. I'm laughing because it's so convenient for you, isn't it? Can I take your picture? You want to take my picture? Sure. Take your hat off. What is wrong with women? God! Where do I start? It's not what's wrong with them, it's what's wrong with me. - Aha. Tell me. - You're looking well. Thank you. You too, dear. I'm glad you're back. You need to let me know ahead of time. I'm sorry, I just got so busy. That's one way to describe it, I've heard other stories. Really? What have you heard? Well, being that we are in polite society. Genes, like Gene Tunney? No. Genes have to do with... the parts of our mothers and fathers that they pass down to us. I don't got a father. That's just ridiculous, everyone has a father somehow. I mean, I don't know who my father is, and... mama won't tell me nothing. Well... These are chromosomes... and... these... are... ...genes. See... in all different shapes and sizes. How is them cotton balls tell me about my father? Well... When you mother and father make you... you get half of your genes from... ...your mother and the other half from your father. So? So... Even if you never knew your father, you still have his genes. Look. Your mother has light hair so you probably got that from her. But your mother does not have that... So you probably got that dimple from your father. Those... goofy cotton balls and stuff tell you all that? Well, sort of... Using genes... you can see part of your father... looking right back at you in the mirror. This is... from my pa'. Hum. Can them bits of cotton tell me... where he lives? What his name is? I'm not sure science has gotten that far yet. Slow down. Why do you say Doctor Bridges? I say you're going to tire me out. I'm one hundred percent male... ...but not entirely human. How's that? Edna... Kids aren't supposed to smoke, you know? Kids aren't supposed to be scientists neither. Hey, look what I found? That's one of my father's research notebooks. Full of data. 'Performance.' 'Ex... pert...' 'Sleepy...' 'Rough...' 'Wet.' 'Kelly, Lilly.' 'MB.' 'LN.' 'DC.' 'EBW.' 'SDC.'? That's Miss Wallace's initials. This is Edith's drawing of a pupa. Stay still... Stand up on the stool. Take off your clothes. C'mon. There is nothing wrong with being naked if it's for art. It's called being nude. I ain't a chicken! ­a... You're a chicken. Well? Look, I'm only gonna put a little bit on the cotton. And I'll do it first to show you it's okay. You'll be nice and relaxed and happy. But not asleep. Do you want to know how to do the Charleston? Like this... Put your hand here. Step this foot back. Take a picture of my meconium, Charlie. Okay. It's the little dark spot on my belly. It should be there unless I'm still a pupa. What are you doing?! No! What would your mother said if she saw you now?! Where is your father?! Calvin! Calvin! Get out here this minute! Okay, Sturt, calm down, what are you doing up at this hour? You and your dirty little whores. I've had it! I'm serious this time! Are you okay? I didn't do it. What the hell is wrong with you!? Get out! Well... I guess the whole world's gone crazy, it's just you and me. I didn't want you here... I told your mother that I did not want you here... and you come into my lab and fuck everything up! You think I don't know!? You think I can't see!? Betsey. - I hate you! - I hate you too! Not entirely 100% male, human. Genes created god, genes created god, genes created god, genes created god. Bithorax human... Genes created god, genes created god, genes created god, genes created god... God created genes. In certain strains involving sex­linked characters, females arose which cannot be explained upon the ordinary mechanisms of sex­linked inheritance. These females were maternal in appearance showing those sex­linked characters which the mother showed but no influence of those borne by the father. Breeding results showed that genetically as well as somatically... - Daddy!- These exceptional females... were exact duplicates of their mother, in that they carried no sex­linked genes introduced by the father. Daddy!!! Betsey? You should really be in bed. I'm okay, Agnes. You've got the trees in the background? - Yes. - Not too much, I should be in the center of the frame. You're a little bit on the side. Well, that's okay, it makes it artistic.
