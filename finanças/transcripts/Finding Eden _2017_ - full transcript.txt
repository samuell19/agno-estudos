Hi, honey. Hey, dad. And then what happened? So Sean, he declares war on me at the lunch table, right? And we're like across from each other. And he gets this giant straw filled with four spit balls. And at the exact time that he shoots it, Mr. Fitzgerald, guess where it goes. What? He walks by and it gets stuck in his beard. You're kidding. And he didn't even notice. He didn't even notice. He went around the whole day with four spitballs in his beard until somebody was like, "Hey, Mr. Fitzgerald, "you got something in your beard." And then he's like, "No, I don't." And then he pulls out all of the spitballs. And they were still wet too. - It was gross. - Oh, that's awful. Speaking of beards, when are you thinking of shaving your vacation beard? It's kinda grown on me. I think it makes me look more distinguished. - No? - What do you think? Well, to be honest, it kinda makes you look like a neanderthal.

Sometimes I get a feeling like I'm just asleep, that this is only a nightmare and everything is still as it was. I'm not sure how long it's been since the Turn. Three winters have come and gone, but it's hard to say anymore. We're always thirsty, always hungry. We tell our son stories about the way things were but he has trouble remembering. I'm finding it difficult to recall. Life has been narrowed down to surviving the hours of each day and making it through the moments in between. The kings took over so fast. They know only violence and roam across the land like a wildfire. There have been rumors of widespread cannibalism. Nothing is safe. we trust no one. Lisa! Sam! No! There you go. Jed? Is that you? Who are you? Why are you following me? You're not my Jed. You're not my son. My Jed. I think they took him. I think they took my boy. Look, can you help me? Please, it's my leg. What happened? Can you give me some of that? Please. Here you go. Now, Jed! Jed! Jed! Jed. I know you're out there. I can smell your dirty ass 50 yards down the road. Hey, why don't you just come out? Nice shot. It's not everyday someone helps someone else around here. It was just a reflex. Hmm. I saw what was happening and I stopped it. Yeah, you did. It's getting late. We should get off the road. They attack at night, mostly. Let's go. I, uh, I need that arrow. Sure. Come on. What were you doing out there all alone anyway? You realize how dumb that was? Maybe, but I don't have a choice. I'm trying to find my family. I understand. Did your family make it through? Hmm? Your family. My daughter was sick in the hospital when the storms came. My wife wouldn't leave her alone for a second. So we had no way of moving her, no one there to help. Everyone was trying to get out of the cities, get to somewhere safe. So we stayed, tried to ride it out. I left for a few moments, maybe 15, 20 minutes, just trying to find some supplies. But when I got back, they were gone. I didn't know what to do. I just wanted to end it right there. Why? Why didn't you? I heard someone calling for help. I followed the voice and, uh, a doctor who came back for supplies was trapped in a collapsed storage closet. I helped him out. I didn't even think for the next few months. It was all I could do just to put one foot in front of the other. I just wanted them back, you know. We moved around. We helped a lot of people. We started putting together this group, a good group, the people who really wanted to start again the right way. How's that? Well, the cities were all fucked up but there were still some places that we could build, places that were untouched. I thought we had found one of those places but then they came and they took them. When? Yesterday. Fuck. I'm sorry. Maybe the two of us we could... Shh! Please! They're all I have. I'm sorry, man. I can't help you. I wanna help, I really do, but I can't. I have a group of people relying on me. They are my family now. Do you have any leads? I've been following these symbols. There's this bloody hand print. Fuck! Donner. Who the fuck is Donner? Shit. Donner is an asshole, a really bad guy. Shit. He used to be part of our group. Not exactly the kind of guy who wants to rebuild, so we exiled him. I exiled him. Where are they? Donner's not the kind of guy you take lightly. I have to find them. Do you understand what I'm saying? They have a camp just down the road, about five miles. Show me! Really? Fuck. Show me! We're here. Five miles down this road that way. Then you head south, a few hundred yards, you'll find him there. I know you have to do this. Nothing I can say can stop you. A friend of mine's gonna be here in a couple of days. If you find your family, when you find your family, bring them back here. My friend will bring you guys to safety. Okay? Hey. It's gonna be okay. Hey! Your family are gonna be okay. Get some sleep. You're gonna need it. I'll take first watch. Oh, my gosh. Yes! Yes! Yeah! Nice. I love you. Seriously? What? That is exactly what I'm talking about. It just holds it for later. It's still delicious. Gross. It's multifunctional. No. - No. - It's warm. It's fluffy. Gross. Goddamn dog! Wendy! Wendy, where are you? Hey, Calvin, where you at? I think I see 'em! Wait. Who's there? Wendy! Wendy, you smell that? Wendy! Wendy, where are you? You missed. Get him, Calvin! Best you come on out now. Go fetch, boy! Go fetch! Put your hands up. I ain't trying to hurt you. We got food and drink. Now why don't you come on out here and join us for supper? Can we stay? Can we stay? Here he is, boss. Good morning, pretty boy. My men tell me that you've been following us. What for? You got some white teeth. I'm guessing like mouthwash. I brush 'em. You should try it sometime. You're a funny guy. I like that. Funny guy here. I mean, I know hygiene's important. I tell these guys that all the time. But they don't listen much. Now, I don't know if you notice where you're at or not, but you're not going anywhere. If you don't start talking to me, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to gut you wide open and drag you behind that truck over there till your skin peels off. You ain't wanna go down that road, right? I saw you. You looked like a strong crew. I think I could join up. I can help you. Really? We look like a strong crew. Sure, boss. We are a strong crew. After all's said and done, maybe I'll have a use for you. What do you think, guys? You think he'd be useful? That sucks. The pussy passed out. Christ. Geez, what a pussy. Dad, dad. Help us. Dad! Help! Hello. Are you awake? Did you mean what you said earlier about joining their crew? Who are you? Are you here to help us? I'm looking for a woman and a child. They would have been here a few days ago. Can you hear me? They're coming. Look what we got here. Pretty boy. Whoo! Pussy. Donner wants to see you. There you go, sweetheart. Get up, bitch. Move. Where are you taking him? What you looking at, ho? Get back. Here he is, boss. Evening and welcome. Have a seat. Come on, take a load off. Sit! Now! Punk ass bitch. You drink? Wasn't that much of a drinker anyway. Do you have any water? Not at the moment. Got some stew over there. I had some earlier. It ain't half bad. Go ahead, man. Get yourself a bite. Yeah, maybe in a minute. I'm still a little dizzy from when your men flocked me in the face earlier. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. They're a ruthless batch out here, fucking ruthless. What's wrong? Nothing. I was thinking about the last time I heard music. It wasn't metal though. Well, we'll have to fix that. What are you doing? Go ahead, Billy, try it. I'm fucking doing it. Go ahead, man. Don't tell me you're not hungry. What did you say was in this? I didn't. What's wrong? What's the longest you've gone between meals since the Turn? I don't know. I mean, man, I gotta give it to you. You're pretty clever to have lasted this long. Trust me, I know it ain't easy. The one thing I can't wrap my head around though, you know, only two things make you come out here and see me. Love or hate. Let's face it. At the end of the day, they're both one and the same, make you do crazy stupid shit. Now, I don't really remember us crossing paths, but if we had, ask these guys. I'm a hell of a guy, so you couldn't, couldn't possibly hate me. Could you? Fine then. So it must be love. Question is which one of our guests. Which one? Get away from me! Stop! No! Get down! This one? What do you think? No. You know that man? No. This guy. Do you know him? Guess not. No! How about this one? Huh? We got a winner. Do we got a winner? Please, no! Come on, girls. Don't be shy. Go away! Move your ass, bitch. No! Stop it! Stop it! No more fucking games. That's why you're here, isn't it? Gentlemen, Down! what we got here is a good old-fashioned family man. Sit down! Oh, yeah. No. Mom! Now she's real pretty. Tried to sweet talk her the other night, but I'm guessing maybe I'm a little bit rusty. What do you think, she'll come around? What did you think? You think you're just gonna sneak in here, swoop them up from under my nose? Yeah. Mom! Dad! Mm-hmm, yup. What was you saying? Just to clue you in, what we're doing here is called a negotiation. That's where I have something you want and you may have information that I need. If you don't, not really much of a negotiation. Now, I know we haven't been around civilized in a long time but surely, you can understand negotiation. Right? There's people out here have a settlement camp of some kind. There's water, cattle aplenty. They don't wanna share. Goddamn shame because that means I just have to take everything. Know anything about that? You know what a pain breakaway point is? It's where you have so much pain, and you're the tough guy and you're protecting your family, and mostly because you think it'll go away then it don't. And you think you can take it, but then you can't. And the pain persists, slowly. And you think it's gotta stop some time, but then it don't. And your soul realizes that it's not gonna go away. They know that before you do. Your soul breaks away from the pain. And it's at that point right there that you will tell me anything I wanna know just to get your soul back. Well, now, the question is are you gonna tell me that before or after I kill that son of yours. No. I don't wanna do the kid any favors, it's a real fucked up world and he's better off without it, but I will. Will you quit with that damn thing! Ah. Look, the sun's gonna come up pretty soon, as you could see. I got more bodies than I wanna deal with. I don't need more. So you tell me where this little camp is and I'll let you and your family go on your merry way. I'll let you go. Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you anything. Can you quit that goddamn... Dad! Dad, help me! Drop it! Drop it now! Don't shoot. Just don't shoot. Dad! You're bleeding bad. We gotta go. We're close. To what? Adam! Dad! Adam. Adam. Sorry. For what? Your ring. Oh, God. It's okay. I left it behind for you to find. Sam. And you did. Please stay with us. Please. Dad. What? Please. Please. You, move! Please! Okay. Can you help us? It's gonna be okay. I need to take a look at this. Okay, all right, he's hit pretty bad. I need your hands. Put your hands here. Ready? Keep pressure on that. It will help with the bleeding. All right. He's going to be okay. We're here to help you. Is he gonna die? Huh? It's gonna be okay. Hey, John, I always gotta clean up everything you start? Really? You wanna do this now? Fred, he's hit bad. He's not gonna make it. I need your help. You cleared him. Let's go. I need your help, come on. Dad's gonna be okay. Come on, we gotta go. Fred! Snap out of it, man. Let's go! Adam. Adam. Please come back. Come back to us. Dad, don't go. We need you, Adam. Dad, stay with us. We're here for you, dad. Dad. Hey. I love you.
