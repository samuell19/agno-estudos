Manager Park Joon-Young, right? Is he really wanted? How long will you let it go? Till he leaks all inside information? I'm sorry. I will immediately track his location and... Are you a parrot?! It is already a week that you try to "immediately" track his location! What about Kang I-an? He was 48 hours late with his report. It's early yet to say, that he is connected to manager Yoo. In this case not early. You will put yourself together, when you will get fired? And the responsible is not coming. We need to gather them all. He is coming at last, dumbass. ID. Kang I-an. Kang I-an. Could you reach Kang I-an? He is the best agent in our team. You know, that this is difficult. Bride? Her phone was switched off the same day. First we reported her missing to the police. But if the chief agrees, I will start looking for her. After we catch manager Yoo. Don't rush. If the news will get to the head office like the last time, we will all get problems. Manager Yoo, Moon Jin-ah and Kang I-an disappeared at the same time. I think we should hurry. First find manager Yoo. Got it. Kang I-an, the girl from the church, Ji Cheol-ho, Lee Shin-woo, Park Young-Woo, Noah Moolsan... Kang I-an Everybody knows Kang I-an. Kang I-an. Kang I-an... Where is Kang I-an? Hold on.

Where is I-an? Wait... Where is I-an? I want to know it too. When I came back that day, there was nobody. They are also looking for I-an. So have has to be alive. So that I-an... He is immobilized, so he has to be treated somewhere. Hold tight! Listen. It will be hard to understand. But listen to me. Something strange is happening to me. First, I'm not the person, who you see now. I'm in a different body now. But the bodies always change. Twice a day. At midnight and midday. Always changing to someone different. What are you talking about? In the church today it was also me. You were threatening me with a gun. Who is real me? What is happening? I don't remember anything about it! I don't know, why this is happening! But I think, I am that man. That man? Kang I-an. Why did it all happen? Why that man knows me? And these people, who are they at all? God damn it! How did you know, that I was in the church? Because it was me! I think, I'm Kang I-an. What are you saying? You started all this. Hyundai, 3882! If I-an dies, I can kill you too. Wait! Wait! Hey you! Shit! Hey! I have no time at all. You have bit different statements. Do you see that car? I was driving from there... Ah... Ah, I will loose my mind, what is it do you think? Don't move. Move and you're dead. Do you know Kang I-an? What? Tell me about him. Why is everyone looking for him? What are you trying to achieve now? I don't remember anything now. But I know, that 10mm deeper and there will be carotid artery and then you will die. You know more about Kang I-an, why do you ask me? 5mm left. I'm doing only what I'm ordered. I'm told to catch, then I catch. To eliminate, then I eliminate. Ji Cheol-ho, Lee Shin-woo, Park Young-Woo, and me now. Who are these people? Why the fuck should I know? Hold on, hold on, hold on! The cop is coming. Police, there is police! When did you see Kang I-an? When did you see him last time? When he was escaping with the car that had an accident. Don't lie! There was only man in that car! I really saw, how he drove off in that car! Kang I-an was also in that car? Till 8 o'clock you need to come with the vehicle documents... Moon Jin-ah and manager Yoo came here, however you just let them go, isn't it? Curious, what are your trying to achieve? Nothing. Nothing? What then? Tomorrow they will hand over the merchandise. Till that time you had to deal with everything. I have a bad feeling. Why Ji Cheol-ho lost his mind is not clear. I have no idea why I have the gun of Kang I-an. Manager Yoo was strange also. Everyone around, one by one... Speak. As you said, she is here. What should I do? Bring her? Or just kill her right here? No, watch her, check where she will go. They found Moon Jin-ah. I handed it over to Jeongmo guys. I can't trust you. I'm leaving. Did you bring it? So what is it? They say, that Kang I-an is involved in some scam. The mood in the office was just...

But if you want, I can investigate you. I heard it is somewhere in Namyangju. Maybe at some factory. Where is Kang I-an? Kang I-an... I don't know, where he is. So it is better. When I escaped, I decided to come and check, and he was there. So and where it that "there"?! Where?! Well... Curious? Yes. Kang I-an is my friend. I know, where he is. But I will not tell you. Fucking junkie. How long will you keep looking? It is broken. This is the end. It's past midnight already. And the moon is on the right side. The car is heading south-east. Highway 66. Heading south-east on the highway 66. How do you know all this? Even if it is so, we can not search all the highway. Highway 66? One moment. I think I know, where it is. Hi.

We go in immediately when it's surrounded. Wait for the order. I have a bad feeling about it. It will be fun. Let's get inside. Check if merchandise is there. Put a cordon outside. Search the area around. End of operation: 5:27. Let's count. Name of deceased: Jae I-myung. Lost merchandise - new drug from Thailand called "Eterecs". Unlike other drugs this one places you in a near death state of mind, like you are separated from your body. Small capsules are getting in blood stream and rupture every 12 hours keeping hallucinations in effect. Due to high strength of the drug there are many side effects. Common are hearing hallucinations and some physical symptoms. In worst case you loose memory and then die. Lost merchandise weighs 3570kg and costs 25 billion won. If it will hit the market, it's the end. I need to talk. Come out for a moment. Kang I-an! Yes. You still didn't find the location of Yoo Joon-Youngа? No, not yet. He is definitely connected to the events today. If you will get any info about him immediately report to me. Report about all movements. How many times did we find bodies instead of drugs? If we will not deal with it, we will have to ask for help from the police. Let's not disgrace ourselves. Yeah. Where were you hiding all this time? Some place here, some place there. Why do you have my lighter? Why was it at the crime scene? Inside the organization there are some, who kill the drug dealers and lay their hands on drugs. Is it not because you leaked the information? They forged the evidence. I investigated that, that's why they pinned that to me and they are looking for me now. Cut the crap. Turn yourself in. Get your hand out. Trust me. Get your hand out, I said! Check it. Did you call Park? I said, you are turning yourself in. Do not resist. Make sure to check it. It's cold. Did you wait long? Sorry, I had some urgent things to do. So if I'm here, should I come in and confess? Confess what? Confess at home. Seoul has a great night view. Yes, indeed. What is it? What happened? Joon-Young... Manager Yoo? Yes. He is wanted since last week, he leaked all inside information. What? I've though a lot about it, but I reported him. Not a nice feeling. So that's why you were so down? And what to do now? Call from head office. Probably urgent. Let's talk at home. They say some cops lay their hands on drugs. Are you them? Yes. We are those cops. Leave what you have and get off. Nothing to say? If you leave quietly, nobody will get hurt. It's your choice. Hey, shit! What the...? Where are you going? What is it? Jin-ah. Who are you? Hey! Shit! Where are you? And where are you? Chief Park? Jin-ah! I-an! Jin-ah! Jin-ah! I-an! Stop it. Jin-ah! He must be calmed down. I-an! I-an! I will kill you, bastards! I-an! I-an! No! Stop! No! No! I-an... I-an! I-an!

What should I do? We are surrounded outside by guys with guns! They are here because of you? Me? I?..Me?.. Leave, hurry. I don't need a massacre here! Get out of here now! Listen.

Wait in the car. Chief Lee! Chief! I don't... What are you going to do? Do you know how much is that deal? Do you want to spoil everything? Chief Lee... The police will arrive soon, so let's finish fast. No! What the...? Drive! Get out! Stop! Flight 8700... Still taking drugs? No peace with you, not at all! How many did you kill already, God damn it? I told you, not to handle Kang I-an like that. You wanted so much to do it your way? Hired some junkie. You want to get my place? I will deal with everything. I've dealt with everything till now. I caught Moon Jin-ah. And manager Yoo. And later... caught Kang I-an too. Ah, no, didn't catch yet... but soon I will! Do I need something else? Ah?

What are you staring at? Joon-Young! Joon-Young! Joon-Young! Joon-Young... They all were there that day. I'm transferring into them. Park, get up! Wake up! What are you doing? Calm down. We must get out of here. Ah, shit! It's you, chief Chung! Who are you? What about Lee? Well, he is sick. Getting rest. Getting rest? He is strange lately. Well, it always like this with people. They are strange. Enough? Bring the merchandise. Yes. You said, you tested it? Of course. Thoroughly tested. Park, what is it? Where is Jin-ah? You motherfucker! What was it?

Bastard. Rat! Sitting here. Move! Fucking looser! Made some shit behind my back? You piss me off. Can't even clean it up, idiot... What are you staring at! Be quiet. I can't concentrate! What do you want from me, fucking idiots? Ah? He is nuts. If you stayed alive, you better run away. Did you come here to make a mess? Ah? Ah? What is that? Why are you here? Come here. There is something interesting here. Where is Jin-ah Where is Jin-ah?! Have you lost your mind? Hey! How do you want to deal with that? You got your revenge already. Stop it. You are Park?
