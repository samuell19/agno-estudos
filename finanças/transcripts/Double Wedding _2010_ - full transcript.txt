So i started "renewability," Which is a foundation that creates Post-Catastrophic housing that can become permanent homes. So, all the modules i designed are easily moved in, They're set up, they're partially solar-Fueled. I-I even got a, um... there's room under my chicken caesar. Damn it. What?

[ Keys clacking ] There! Take that! You know, computers can't fight back. All week, i've had the highest bid On the gas tank i need for the jag. Then out of nowhere, This guy comes along and bids me up over $300 With two minutes left. So, where are the mcciver files? Oh, i sent those off hours ago. Come on. Hang out with me. We can go grab a drink. Wait. What?! W-Why -- Why did you call me? In case you needed saving from another bad date. It was not a bad date. It was actually an okay date for the first date. Yeah, well, it couldn't have been that good, Or you wouldn't have bailed on him to come back here. I bailed because you told me That there was something wrong with the mcciver deal. And i can't afford for that deal to go south. Oh, my god. You actually like this guy. You may have met the one. Well... i wouldn't know, because you hijacked my date. Jealous? No, i'm just thrilled To have another mets fan to hang out with. You picked my date so you could get a baseball buddy? His profile said he had box seats. [ Scoffs ] you're such an ass.

You know, they have these things called stores, Where you can buy food and drink of your very own. Five dates. Doctor's orders. [ Horns honking ] Deanna: late as usual, danielle. Hi. So, i told everybody at the office That you're gonna be on tv. Ugh. This is a once-In-A-Lifetime opportunity. Embrace it. Competition is exciting. Or nauseating, depending on what side of the camera you're on. You're coming, right? Mm-Hmm. December 17th is blacked out on the blackberry. Okay, good, because i can't imagine going through this Without you being there. All right, so, let's start the wedding to-Do list. First, find the church, Then the place for the reception. [ Sighs ] you already made the list? I wanted you to wait. Just say "thank you" For utilizing my obsessive-Compulsive disorder To your advantage and go get a mani-Pedi. You go get the mani and pedi. Oh, wait, no. That's impossible, because you can't work with wet nails. You're going? I've got to get back to the office. You're not going. Just because you were late doesn't mean i want to be late. You want input, just put in. Oh, come on. It'll be a shame to waste all that ocd On your dumb-Ass sister who can't say "thank you." Thank you. And i love you, i love you, i love you. You should. Mwah! All right, i'll see you later, okay? Have fun working on sunday. [ Sighs ] Well... i didn't think i'd get this lucky this soon. I was just thinking about you. You were, were you? Mm-Hmm. What, you weren't thinking about me? No. I can't say that i was. Ow. Well, this is obviously a situation That needs to be rectified. Obviously. So, i'm gonna... get something sweet to eat, and then we can hang. Oh, no. You go for the coffee here. The sweet stuff is awful. Well, then, take me where it's fantastic. [ Chuckles ] really? Why not? Ohh. Of course. I get it. Hold on. Hmm? [ Camera shutter clicks ] Now, if i turn out to be tate kelley, ax murderer, You can give the cops an accurate description. All right. Come on. We got some serious pastry shopping to do. Lead the sweet way. When you said you were gonna take me to something sweet, I didn't know you were gonna drag my ass all over manhattan. [ Chuckles ] it's because i do this walk every sunday. It's research. I figure i have to do something distinctive to set me apart, And not to sound full of myself, but my baking does that. You bake on top of everything else? It's more of everything else on top of baking. Granted, it helps that i'm a major insomniac Because there's no real end to the workday anymore. My mom is always saying, "d, slow down," but i can't. A lot of my enjoyment comes from... what my clients get out of what i create. I know, right? When i imagine them living in it, i'm like -- Living in what? The houses i design. You know what? I'm banning 24-7 work talk. From now on, you and me -- It's passion talk only. All right? Anyway, i need some sugar. Come on. Mm-Hmm. [ Smacks lips ] [ Laughs ] Oh, wow. Men -- You're all pavlovian response. Well, actually, you know what, there's something else i need first. Seriously? After complaining i wasn't letting you eat, Now you don't want to eat? No, i want to eat, but i need your phone number first. You just cut right to the chase, don't you? When i saw you at the coffee house, i knew it was fate, so... you mind? Really? No. If i'm not home, it forwards to my cell. Mm-Hmm. Now i'm ready. [ Laughs ] Mmm! Jaz: there must be something more exciting to do on a sunday. All work and no play Makes you a very, very dull lawyer. Come on. You're coming with me. Did you know that this baby raced at le mans and sebring? Oh, you mean this thing will actually run on its own? F.Y.I. -- I will have you know, this baby was the find of the year -- 1960, wind-Up windows. Oh. No power windows. That's a plus. D, would you stop fingering the electronics? It's tate. He hasn't called yet? I'll beat him up. The ball's in my court Since i was the one who bailed on him For your work emergency. We didn't even get to exchange numbers. But, thankfully, there's e-Mail. [ Beep ] there. Now... pizza, bad movie... or the jag? She's mine. [ Cellphone beeps ] Whoo! Lategano's. Hmm, for tomorrow night. Eh. I could've sworn she said Was more into like a "hole in the wall" type place, And then she suggests a four-Star restaurant? Maybe to her, this is a "hole in the wall" place. Anyway, she says it's on her. I love this girl already. [ Beeping ] What the hell are you doing? [ Beep ] Seizing your day. Give me. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] [ Soft piano music playing ] Deanna: so, tate... i know this, um, may be too early to say anything, But i work with corporate clients, And they have a pro-Bono mission to provide low-Cost housing. And i thought maybe i can get you in a room with all of them. Would you be interested? Are you kidding? Yeah, that -- That would be great. Yeah, sure. Oh, well, it's just -- My experience with creative people Is that they need someone non-Creative To implement their ideas. So... i jotted down some thoughts. [ Laughs ] Right. When did you find time to do all this? This is... oh, that's right -- You don't sleep. [ Scoffs ] as if i can function without nine hours a night. So, are you -- Are you okay with this? You don't think i'm crazy, right? Crazy in a great way. Not in an overstepping... um, insanity, workaholic type-A way? Because some creative people have mentioned that to me. Well, i'll put it this way -- Nobody can make a workaholic taste as sweet as you can. Oh, look, see. Now we're doing it again. We -- This is great, by the way. I mean, this is -- But, uh, we are veering dangerously Into talking about work only, So i'm gonna switch it up a little. You have got to try this. Oh! Oh, god. I'm sorry. Sorry. You came at me so fast with that. I don't like other people to feed me. Waiter, can i... what? Uh, i-I'll get it. I'll get it. Thank you. Obviously, the waiter got a lot further tonight than i will. Oh, so you saw me slipping him my number While he was patting me down? [ Both laugh ] Speaking of numbers, did you lose mine already? 'Cause i called you at your office, but you e-Mailed me back. I don't think i got your -- You know, i'm gonna put it in here, Add it to your vast store of information. I just like hearing your voice so much more Than reading an e-Mail. You do? Yeah. Talk about something that could drive a guy crazy. In a good way. Really? Definitely. Jaz: so... how went the date with tate? [ Sighs ] good. He's not gonna compromise our hang-Out time, though, is he? You're the one that set me up with him. You're not allowed to complain. Besides, there's nothing to compromise if he doesn't call. He'll call. But don't you call him. ...and a buttery, popcorn, dusty smell. Danielle: i know, right? I hate watching movies on dvd. Movies should... should loom over you in scratchy black and white. Old theaters with broken seats. All right, um... [ chuckles ] I'm just finishing up my disastrous attempt At a sweet-16 cake, And now i've got fondant all over me. How are you gonna get all of that off? Cold shower, i think. Ouch. [ Chuckles ] I didn't mean it like that. It's just... i have this history of... not taking things slow. And this time, i... i want to take it slow. Slow how? "Discovering each other and not getting bored" slow. All right. [ Chuckles ] We share the duplex we grew up in, And i love that -- Having her and jim close by. Our, uh... parents died in a car accident. But karen won't let me use that As an excuse for anything, you know? She and my sister should form a club. My dad walked out before our english final, And she aced it, while i tanked. She took care of everything and everyone While i... oh, it's such a haze. I don't -- I don't even know what i did. Hey, it's getting late. You want to go grab a bite? No, thank you. I'll order in tonight. I'm finally in the zone. I'll buy. No. I am determined to get it done. Why don't you spend the evening with your true love And go fix a gasket or something? Thanks. You know, we've been talking for hours. And i don't want to stop. But i know if i was a better man, I'd let you get to bed, get your nine hours in. [ Laughs ] That's a laugh. Besides... i'm already in bed. Oh, yeah? Me too. You mean what you said before about taking it slow? I do. We can have phone sleep. Phone sleep? We won't hang up. I know, cheesy, but... good cheesy? Sweet dreams, d. [ Sighs ] Danielle: you're going off list? This is highly unorthodox of you, deanna. I know, but i heard about the church and came to see it, And i don't think you'll mind that i brought you here first. This is it. Henry: it's perfect, girls. Henry, it's everything we imagined. It is. Trust me -- This is everything that you said you wanted. What made you think of this? A little help from a friend. What friend? It was black-Boots guy, wasn't it? Black-Boots guy? [ Chuckles ] No, brown-Boots guy. Sorry, d. I think you may be dancing at the wedding by yourself. Believe it or not, My new guy has lasted three weeks and counting. So, when do we get to meet these guys? You guys want to meet him before the wedding? Well, of course before the wedding. I just don't think we're at the "meet the grandparents" phase yet. Ditto. Well, if you want An "and guest" on your invitation, You need the bride and groom's stamp of approval. What? I don't recall that clause. Well, consider it written, signed, and notarized. Well, i could use a bigger peanut gallery at the taping, So i'll invite my wedding contender at the cake-Off If you invite yours. He'll be there. Okay. Happy, bridezilla? Thrilled. I can't wait to meet the boyfriends. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] So, there's something i've been meaning to ask you. Uh-Oh. That sounds ominous. [ Beep ] hold on a sec. I'm getting a beep. [ Beep ] hello? Hey, it's me. That's odd. I'm odd? [ Beep ] yes. No, it's the phone. Hold on a sec. [ Beep ] hello? Still here with the ominous request. Uh, yeah, all right, uh, lay it on me. Okay, um, how would you feel About being my cheering section And possibly meeting way too many members of my family In front of a live studio audience on december 17th? Uh... [ beep ] Hold on. [ Beep ] hello? Ohh! Hey. Uh, i thought i lost you. So, december 17th -- I know it's long notice, but is your schedule clear? 'Cause i kind of said you'd come. [ Laughs ] oh, you did, huh? Well, look, uh... you're gonna have to be a little more persuasive If you want me to ease your suffering. I mean... what's in it for me? Free food. Hey, hey, watch it, man! Watch it! Sorry! Tate? Tate? Hello? What happened? What happened? Are you okay? Are you okay? You're all echo-Y. I can't -- Oh, cracked my phone. Hello? It's on december 17th. It's on december 17th. Huh? December 17th.

And you -- You're fired. Ha! Oh, you work at the firm, too? "The firm"? [ Chuckles ] Well, that's a fancy way of putting it. [ Laughs ] I'll see you at the firm. [ Chuckles ] Amy: good to meet you, tate. Nice to meet you, too. Bye. Bye, guys. Hi. Hey. Okay. [ Chuckles ] We should go, or we'll be late for the movie. [ Horns honking ] I am convinced that renewability will give bowman corporation The tax shelters you so desperately need, While helping create low-Cost, quick, self-Sustainable housing In devastated areas. I mean, this is a partnership That will give you unprecedented, great p.R. And, in my opinion, is a win-Win, win-Win. [ Laughter ] Oh, before she goes, I'd just like to thank miss warren For introducing us. All right, i'll leave you guys to it. [ Inhales deeply ] All right, so... can you just turn to page 3 in the booklets i've got you? You'll see there... [ speaking indistinctly ] What's going on? People could move in, And then there's a lot more accountability For, uh, the community that's already there. Is that tate? Yep. You may not be the only matchmaker around here. Hey, jaz, i'm not sure if i said "thank you." Thank you. You're gonna be a great mom someday. I should know. You boss me around enough. I hope you're prepared to put that in writing. Writing? We're gonna try to adopt. Oh, my -- That is fantastic! Thank you, thank you. Well, you're gonna have to write Some letters of recommendation. You better have something nicer to say Than the fact that i'm just bossy, or else. Can't believe i'm finally gonna get to be an uncle. Hey, you're gonna have your chance, too, you know? Hey, maybe d's that chance. Yeah. I don't know. I love how driven she is -- You know, partner track, bakery. And we can talk. And we will talk for hours... about anything. But sometimes she can just be so uptight and obsessive. It's like... i don't know. It just drives me crazy. She baffles me and intoxicates me At the same time. How do i know if she's the one? I think you already do. [ Chuckles ] Deanna: okay, so, um, friday is the tasting. Philippe will be there precisely at 3:00 p.M. So, danielle, please, don't be late. Who is philippe? I hired an assistant. You can't hire an assistant to a tasting. Well, apparently, on craigslist, you can. I can't leave the office in the middle of the day To taste food. You just wish you thought of it first. No. This is ridiculous. It just defeats the whole idea Of us helping make the wedding. I'm calling grandma. What?! D, give me that! No, don't call gram. Don't put her into this, okay? Why, because she's gonna tell you you're wrong? Um, i found the church, I found the hall for the reception. What more am i supposed to do? I'm sorry -- Sitting around sampling baby lamb chops Is not a practical use of my time. Why is your busy always better than my busy? Um, you don't bill $225 an hour. Your priorities are so screwed up. D, just give -- It's not about the food! Excuse me? My priorities are not screwed up. I do everyone's taxes, the whole family's will, And i made a business plan For a bakery that's collecting dust somewhere. Did anyone ask you to do that? I'm sorry. I didn't -- I didn't mean to say it. [ Cellphone ringing ] Why is there a photo of tate on here? 'Cause that's my boyfriend. Just give me that. What? No, it's -- That's my boyfriend. He can't be your -- The black-Boots guy? Brown-Boots guy. He can't be the one you're bringing to the taping? He's the one i'm bringing to the wedding. I can't believe her. I can't believe her. I'm nothing like deanna. Couldn't he see that? I met him first. I finally meet someone amazing who thinks i'm amazing, And he thinks half of me is her. How is that possible? I'm nothing like danielle. I'm me, and she's -- She's this nightmare Who is acting as if I deliberately went after her boyfriend. If she gets him, it's not like he's getting Who he thought he was getting at all. What's the big deal? Aren't you the one Who's always saying, "a man is like a bus -- There's always another one rolling along in a few minutes"? Yeah, but this is -- If it's that important to her, let deanna have him. Jaz: still want to see him? It's every guy's fantasy to date twins. But you don't actually do it. Yeah, but it's not as if tate knows he's doing it. He obviously thinks he's dating the same person. Maybe i don't want to wait for the next bus. Maybe i want a seat on this bus. Hmm, is that you speaking, Or is that "you being pissed at deanna" speaking? Okay, maybe it is an honest mistake. But how can he not tell you two apart? You're singular, you're unique. You know this tate/danielle mix-Up Has nothing to do with you, right? I mean, a guy would be crazy To not choose you over her. Sorry i'm late. Uh, i think this needs to be taken in, gram. I thought you said she wasn't gonna be here. What is she doing here? It's grambush -- A grandma ambush. I'm surprised neither of you saw it coming. You lost your edge. You're wearing my dress. Take it off. Well, fuchsia looks better on me. You're not gonna steal this from me, too. Oh, yeah, deanna, that's it -- I posed as you, stole tate, and made him fall for me. He didn't fall for you. I had him first. He fell for me first. Oh, it's always about you being first. Oh, cut it out. You're acting like you're 5. Men will come and go in your life, But you two are stuck with each other. We're not conjoined, thank god. You like tate that much? I do like him that much. He was everything on my list. Oh, please. You think you would've made it past the two-Month mark? There's always a chance! You wish! All right, all right. Now, when you were kids and you wouldn't share a toy, It went on a time-Out. Gram, you can't put tate on a time-Out. Well, you're not doing a three-Way. Gram. I'm 71, not dead. You've barely had time to get to know him. So stop it right now. He's off-Limits. You don't see him or return his calls. You don't text him or e-Mail him goodbye. Time-Out. It's the only way. This is about you two. It's not about him. For you, gram, i'll do it. [ Sighs ] if she will, i will. [ Sighs ] i know my running shoe is in here somewhere. Sure it is. I never have people over here. This place is a mess. You have me over. You don't count. [ Grunts ] Hah! [ Chuckles ] Hey, you're back on the prowl, i see. I don't know. I was thinking about ending my membership. I think tate was the only one good one. D, there isn't just one good one. To find another good one, you're gonna have to be proactive And end your deeply committed, Codependent relationship with work. [ Laughs ] am i that bad? Yeah, you're that bad. You need a hobby, like what i have with cars. Yeah, but what you have with cars is not just a hobby. True, but finding something old and rusted and neglected And turning it into something new and beautiful again Is the best thing i can do with myself. ? this boy came into my life... ♪ Is that tate again? Yep. Mailbox full. This is killing me. With deanna in the mix or not, I know tate and i really connected. And you know how rare that is for me. And i can't talk to him because my grandmother won't let me? That's insane. So keep seeing him, then, if that's what you want. No. We agreed. And i really -- I just don't want to hurt my sister. Okay, then. I don't know. Do what you do best -- Forget about him, move on. Amy, i don't want to move on. And i have this really, really, really weird feeling... i'm off men. Hmm.

I may know nothing about cars, and i can see that. But i just -- I just wish that you can see your face When you're talking to me about cars. It's like you're in love. If anyone can make it work, jaz, it's you. Well... i think we've tapped this thing out. Let's call it quits. Yeah, okay. [ Telephone ringing ] Hey. Is, uh, miss warren here? I'm sorry. She's in a meeting. She's in a meeting? Still? Again. Uh, could you, uh, give her my message? I always do. I thought you said "no smoking" in your bio. Oh, no. I don't like it when women smoke.

And, look, i know About everything else you got going on, All the other dreams that you're working on, But i can't help but think the dream of us... it can fit in there. It can fit in there with all your other dreams If you just give us a chance. [ Exhales sharply ] [ Door opens ] [ Door opens, closes ] Tate! Tate, wait. It's hard to face explaining everything to you When it's just gonna make you even angrier. You don't have to explain. I know what it is. [ Chuckles ] i don't think you do. I know you're scared of letting anyone in. I know you're scared that a guy's gonna take off on you The way your dad did. I never said that. You don't have to say it. Look... i live all the time In the fear of losing anyone i love. But i know now that if you don't give it a chance, It's a bigger loss in the long run. Tate, it's -- It's really -- You know what? I don't want you to tell me anything right now. We're gonna get through this, right? We'll figure it out. But right now, i think we need to have a great night. Hmm? Want to come along with me?

I meant to ask how you see your future. Oh, right. Waiter: sorry. Man: excuse me, bro. Danielle: tate! Tate! [ Chuckles ] um... who would you rather spend the rest of your life with -- Some career-Obsessed professional Or someone who could cook you the most amazing dessert Every night for the rest of your life?

You lied to me. It wasn't like that. It was exactly like that. Is this something you two do a lot? Hit on guys online, Think it's funny to stomp all over their hearts? Somehow, everything got all screwed up. And we didn't even know that we were dating -- But you did know at some point, and nowhere in there Did you think about me and what i was going through. That's not true. It didn't even occur to you that i deserved to know, Did it?

Both of y'all had done something horribly wrong, And you didn't think about me. You didn't think about me and what i was going through at all. I thought about you. I couldn't stop thinking about you. If you really had, you would've told me the truth. I'm really sorry. Tate, please. I thought i had found the one. [ Siren wailing ] You can't bail on the cake-Off because of tate. It's not because of tate. Well, you can't bail, period. You know, it doesn't matter if you don't win this thing. It doesn't even matter if you don't get the guy. What matters... is that you put yourself out there for your career The same way you put yourself out there for tate. So i can just get kicked in the heart again? It hurts too much. I like it better just -- Hiding behind everyone else? I don't do that. Danielle... you hid behind me until i sold this place, And you hid behind deanna with tate. What is it that makes you think That you always have to stay two steps behind her? Because she came first. You're both phenomenal in your own ways. And deanna has no problem shining. Why do you? Mrs. Warren: i got a message from your sister, Saying that she wasn't gonna be here for thanksgiving If you were gonna be here... and she gets christmas. I can't explain to you how disappointed i am That you two have let this thing go on for this long. But this thing you -- I've got the stuffing. And, yes, i bought it. Well, i don't care who made it. I'm just glad you're here. That's all. I changed my mind. Well, it's the first good step, isn't it? Well, i wasn't gonna miss out on thanksgiving because of her. You just couldn't stand the fact that i got the first turn. You two, stop it. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means you always have to win. And you don't care who you plow over to get there. You didn't even like tate the way i did. You just needed to be the one who got to him first. I did get to him first. You had the first date, but who got the first kiss? Not you. There wasn't even chemistry until he met me, Not that that's a surprise. Okay, stop this. This is what -- I spent hours on that. Thanks. What is the matter with you? Gram, i'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am so done with the two of you. Thanksgiving dinner is cancelled. Please go. Go? She can go. What?! I'm not going. Both of you go. You've already ruined my wedding planning. The most special thing about having waited so long Was having my daughter and my granddaughters Walk me down the aisle. That made it worth the wait. I need you to leave. Gram. Gram. Work it out, deanna. Gram. You don't understand. She -- She just -- She can't s-- Work...it...out. I cooked, you clean. I really can't argue with that one.

Uh, i think it was a bakery that, uh, d, Or, uh, danielle, i guess, showed me. Honey, you okay? You really didn't eat that much today. Just muddling through. That's better than last week. And it'll be even better next week. You know, i still can't believe i couldn't tell them apart. Eh, i'm declaring a moratorium on relationships. Ah, retreating to the man cave -- Always a good strategy. Hell, yeah, hell, yeah. Not a good strategy. And you can't do that. Yeah, i can. Honey... i know you're feeling sad right now. But, actually, i'm a little happy for you. I mean, maybe the reason you couldn't tell them apart Was because, for the first time in a very long time, You were looking for the best of someone. That's what you fell for. You fell for the best in both of them. You opened yourself up, and you fell in love. And you're gonna need to leave yourself open to that happening again. 'Cause that's what we do. Otherwise, what's the point? [ Telephone ringing ] Deanna! Yeah? You're late for your meeting in the conference room. Everybody's waiting. Meeting? I don't -- I don't have a meeting down-- Upstairs? My apologies. I can't believe i somehow let this meeting slip by. Well, nor can i... especially considering... your work is crucial to this meeting. It concerns the tagen corps account. Oh. Well... was there something missing in their files? Because i... really, deanna... the only thing about your work on this project Is that it needs to be taken over by a partner... ...you. Congratulations. [ Laughs ] You're officially a partner.

[ clears throat ] At least there's champagne, right? It's still cold. Sort of. So, what should we toast to? You, obviously. Oh. Just what i was hoping you'd say. Toast away. To deanna... the most insanely type-A, brilliant lawyer, Who just made partner today. You deserve it. Why, thank you. And to deanna... the most insanely beautiful woman, Who gets me better than anyone else And who i cannot wait to see every morning. Jaz, uh... what are you doing? Jaz, i don't -- I don't think that this is... is it -- Is it tate? D... you just made partner, And you're sitting here all alone, Not knowing what to do with yourself. You don't have anyone else to share it with. I'm asking you to share it with me. Jaz, we can't do this. I want to be with you, d. Don't tell me you don't feel the same. Okay. Then it's just me.

It was long after i met your grandfather that i realized That my sister had done me a favor Because wayne was not the right guy for me.

[ Chuckles ] I think i'm gonna actually go there now... get drunk, And make a complete fool of myself with my broken heart. "Broken heart"? What do you think? I think... maybe as my former work friend, Want to come for a ride with me? Oh. The jag's my showpiece For my new vintage-Car restoration business... for which this will definitely come in handy. [ Chuckles ] So, maybe if we could take the jag out for a spin... and park somewhere... ...i could fix that broken heart.
