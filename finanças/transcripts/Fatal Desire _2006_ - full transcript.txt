I'm sitting in a coffee shop in Atlantic City with a man I met online. Take a wild guess. And I have a daughter, Molly. She's cute. Thanks. If this changes things for you, I understand. And I won't think any less of you, I swear. I just didn't want to start this out on a lie. I wanted you to knowwhat you're getting into. OK. Tell me. Did I scare you away? I'm still sitting here, aren't I? Turn your head to the side. I want to see. Do you know who you remind me of? Don't laugh-- Steve McQueen. [chuckles] Yeah, if your hair were shorter. Who do I look like? Let me see-- you look like a cross between Michelle Pfeiffer and Melanie Griffith. [giggles] Wow. What are you thinking? I'm thinking you're verybrave for coming here.

Whatever you say. [giggles] Gotcha. JOE: So I don't know whatyou want to see first. There's a bar over thereplays pretty good country Western, if you like country. TANYA: Were you a cop? How'd you know that? The way you carry yourself. Most guys are all slouchedover when they walk. Not you-- you-- shoulders back, chin up, in control-- definitely law enforcement. Yeah. Something happened? Could say that. You want to talk about it? Not really. [horn blaring] It's a crosswalk, you frigging idiot. What? He almost hit us. It's not that. It's just-- it's exactly likesomething I would have said. I was a detective, theCounty Sheriff's Department outside of Providence. There is a high profilemurder they couldn't solve. Sheriff tried to pin it on some guy. I wouldn't go along with it, so I got fired. Case went to grand jury. Sheriff was a crook, just like I said. They threw his ass out of office. Did you get your job back? No. But you were right. I testified against thedepartment-- cardinal sin. Nobody would hire me after that. Hell, you must think I'm a fool. My fool. Molly-- that's my main job, taking care of her. And I do wholesale cosmetics on the side. Somebody needs to graze this guy with a bullet. Wholesale cosmetics-- how's that work? Is that one of those pyramid schemes? I just do house parties. It's pretty basic. Whatever you sell, you get yourshare, the company gets theirs. [crowd booing] I'm going to do one for you. You sing? [MUSIC - JOAN JETT & THE BLACKHEARTS, "DO YOU WANNA TOUCH ME"] [SINGING] We've been heretoo long trying to get along, pretending that you're oh-so shy. I'm a natural man, doing what I can.

As much as I love thisplace, we have to move on. Oh, will you tellSheldon I'm going to want a personal day tomorrow? - Sure. Thanks. Hey, Teddy. It's Daddy. Everything all right? TEDDY: Where are you? I thought you had tonight off. I'm not drinking, I promise, OK? I'm just out with someone? Who is she? Listen, I just called to sayif I'm late, do not worry, OK? You're already late. Look, I'll see you in the morning. He's good. [phone dial tone] You know, sometimes I look around the casino-- all these people, theycouldn't have less in common. But for some reason, they end up in the same place on the same night doing the exact same thing. Sounds like my honeymoon. [chuckles] I'm an alcoholic. You don't seem like it. You seem so in control. I am, now. That's after I got blackballedfrom the department. I hit a bad batch-- alcohol, pills. Took me right down. Thank you for telling me. You're welcome. It feels so good, mm. So how long have you been divorced, and why didn't you tell me? You don't miss much, do you? You had a song. He had to come from somewhere. I've been divorced about five months, but it was over way before it started. Susan, my ex, you'd like her. She got me through some really hard times. And you thanked her by leaving? I didn't love her anymore. I am not a good liar. How is he handling it, your son? The divorce? Mm-hm. OK, I guess. He misses his mom. He doesn't want me living by myself. He sounds sweet. He is. I want you to meet him. I was thinking maybe we couldhave breakfast together. That's not going to work. Why? My flight leaves in an hour. OK. Can't you call and say your flight got canceled or something? I can't, Joe. I told Molly. Please, one more day. One more day, for me. Joe, don't ever ask me to choose between you and my daughter. You'll lose. OK. [clears throat] So when am I going to see you again? Soon as I can get away. Don't worry, I'm coming back, I promise. I know this hasn't been easy for you. You know what happened to mom and me. We're going to be all right. You are the best thingthat ever happened to me. I know I don't alwaysact like it, but you are. And that was a hell of a catch [inaudible].. Who taught you that? My little man, my little man-- PAULA: She seems nice. She's married. Kids? A daughter. Internet romance with a married woman-- what could go wrong? JOE [VOICEOVER]: I try and tryto stop thinking about you, but it's hopeless. I adore you like no one before you. I will never let you go, I swear. Your fool, Joe. TANYA: There you are in the early light of day. There you are in the quiet words, I pray. I've been blessed by the simplehappiness of the perfect love we have made. Every time I turn around, whenI am lost and when I am found, like an angel standing guard, there you are. There you are standing in a crowded room. There you are, theEarth, and I am the moon. My desire is to stand by thefire that burns inside you. Your fool, Tanya. [slot machines whirring] What do you think? I don't know. I'm going to watch a few more hands. Call for you. Not now. Someone named Tanya. Is this Joe Donnelly, the man I keep having dirty dreams about? I don't know. Can you describe those dreams? So what did you think? JOE: Think about what? You forgot already? The video, you fool. Let me tell you something,I will never, long as I live, forget that video. Blew my mind. I'm not even going to tell youhow many times I watched it. Well, how about the realthing again next Saturday night. JOE: You coming back? TANYA: Told you I would. Oh, man. I can't wait. [knocking] WOMAN: Hey, Tanya. Listen, I gotta go.

Hey, I'm a little freaked out. David wants me to get a Wonderbra. [chuckles] What did you do? What? Nothing. Don't what nothing me. I know that look.

[laughs] Uh, you slept with him? Don't lie. I knew I should have gone with you. I'm going back next weekend. Can you take care of Molly for me? Tanny, what if Mark finds out about this?

I'm not joking around this time, Tanny. Let's get married. Joe-- This is big. We're having a baby. I know it's big. Why not? You know why not. So divorce him. It's not that simple.

I just think about himthe whole time I'm there. When I'm here, all I want to dois think about you, you and me. If we can't do that, I mightas well be back in Pittsburgh. It's just temporary until Ican find something, you know, better. Hold on a second. I'll see if he's here. Teddy? Oh, I love thinkingabout you sitting here, sun coming in right [inaudible]. Teddy? This is Teddy. This is Tanya, friend of mine. What a handsome young man you are. Catch. [laughs] So what's he do for a living? Come on, I'm just asking. I don't know. All I know about is BDNH. BDNH. BDNH Auto, the salvage yard he owns. That's how I met him. They needed someone to handle their books. The rest of his life-- yourguess is as good as mine. These guys come over to the house sometimes, these creepy lookingguys in expensive suits-- he won't even talk to them in the house. Or he'll get a phone call, say he's going to some NASCAR race--disappear for a few days. When he comes home, I find clumps of money in his coat pocket. I counted it once-- $10,000, Joe, in two days. He didn't make it doingbrake jobs, I know that much. He could be involved in some kind of organized crime, you know? Drugs, racketeering, something like that. Pass himself off as thisregular guy, you know? I had no idea who I was marrying. Sometimes I think the only reason he married me is because he worried when Ilooked at the website, figured out something was going on. Can I use your phone? - What? I have to book a room for the night. You're staying here. I'm not having you in a hotel. It's too soon. Think about him. What do you think he's going to feel, seeing another woman in his mom's bed? Susan never slept here. You know what I mean. That's OK. You can stay, if you want. Are you sure, hun? Because I don't mind a hotel. Yeah, you make my dad happy. Oh-- Oh. [laughing] Oh, was I too loud? I don't think so, but it's all right. It's all right. [laughing] God. Oh, baby. Oh my god, what-- what-- what happened? Oh, oh-- it's OK. It's not real. It just-- it clips in. Oh, does that gross you out? No, it freaked me out. It's OK. [sighs] So what'd you say toMark to let you get away? Oh, I told him that wehad some sales conference to go to that uh, we werecoming out with a new line of smudge free lip gloss. Not the brightest bulb on the tree, is he? Oh, don't be jealous. You're the one I love. Besides, you're bigger than he is. Oh, you mean George. - George? - George. Why George? - Because he's curious. - Oh. [giggles] Do you want it to be a boy or a girl. I don't care. Either way, it makes me happy. Here's what we do after the divorce. We bring Molly out. We have a baby. We buy a house. You put in a pool. We'll be a family. How does that sound? Before we make any more plans, I have to tell you what happened. What? I was six or seven when it started, 13 when it finally stopped. Whole time it was happening,you know what I thought? I thought it was love. I thought he loved me. He kept telling me how special I was. That's why I told on him, because he started um, paying attention tosomebody else, some other girl. I felt like I wasn't special no more. Like I was nothing. I'm damaged. Do you still want me? [slot machines whirring] Paula, I'm having Joe's baby. Is this a congratulationsmoment, or an oh dear? Well, both, I guess. You know I'm married. Yeah, Joe told me. Divorce court, here I come. You know, there's not a lot of pretense. But Joe, he's pretty wide open. It just wouldn't take muchto hurt him, you know? Oh, you have feelings for him, don't you? Who said that? Don't worry. I'll be careful with him. What are they doing in there? Beautification. I've never had aprofessional makeup job before. I usually just slap it on. Oh my god. Know what I'm thinking about? What? All the hearts you're going to break. Ta-da. TEDDY: Woah. It's a bit over the top? No, no, you look great. Yeah? Uh, hello, over here. Come on. TEDDY: Looking good, Paula. How's the pizza? TEDDY: It's good. [sniffling] What's wrong, baby? I'm lying to myself, and I'm lying to you. [inaudible] Mark isn't going to let me go. He'll put-- he'll put me in the hospital again if I ask him for a divorce. He beat you up? Why didn't you tell me? [inaudible] something I'm proud of. I saw my mother stuck in an abusive relationship. I swore it would never be me. I thought she was weak for staying with him. How often does he hit you? Oh, as often as I make him mad. I don't argue with him anymore. I just give him what he wants when he wants it. Anything he wants? Are you still sleeping with him? Do you have any idea what would happen if I started denying him sex? How do you know it's my baby? Because Mark got fixed after we had Molly. When's the last time you slept with him. When? Two days before I left. Two days. Straight sex or kinky stuff? Oh, what? Oh, now you're mad at me too? Well, that's just what I need, another man who thinks he owns me. Go to hell, both of you. [car door opens] Boy, I tell you, when that Tanya leaves, that girl is gone. Come here, baby. Oh, baby, I'm sorry. It's OK. I get jealous, OK. I'm a jerk. I lay in bed with him some nights and-- if his heart would stop beating-- I wish he'd die. I even had a dream about it once. It was awful. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean anything. I know. But then in the morning when I woke up, I wanted it to be real. Honey, killing never solved anything. Talking is always the better way. There are some people you can't talk to. I know. He ever lays a hand on youagain, you take pictures, OK? OK? Come on, you're shivering. Come on. Let's get you home. [heartbeat] [clears throat] [computer beeps] [sighs] MARK: You've been having sex with my wife. Now she's growing fat with a bastard in her-- not for long. I have heard that the loss ofa baby can make people crazy. [laughing] You think maybe she mightneed some help afterwards? [phone ringing] Hello? Um, just a sec. Mom? Phone. Who is it? Hello? JOE: It's me. Just a sec. Take this downstairs. Thanks, hun. Joe, I told you, you can't call me here. Look, I just got an email from your husband. He knows about the baby. TANYA: What?

Put him on the phone, Tanya. No. Then I'm coming to Pittsburgh. Joe, stop. If you come here, you'regoing to make things worse. Let me handle this, please. I'll call you later, OK? OK? - You can't.

Then I'll talk and you can listen. I don't want a lecture, Paula. You know, I just shelledout $1,500 so you could sleep in your own bed tonight? Think that entitles me to acouple of minutes of your time? What are you now, my sponsor? You know, maybe a sponsor's what you need. Look at me, Joe. At least show me that courtesy. Look, friend to friend, I got to tell you. This thing you've got going on with Tanya-- - Tanya. - Tanya. It doesn't take a genius toquestion the wisdom of it. She's there. You're here. She's married with a kid. You just got divorced. Look what it's doing to you, Joe. I love her. Love someone else. I mean, she's a sweet girl, I admit it. But there are other women out there. Like who? Like anyone, like me. I'll pay you back the money. Get it-- right-- uh-huh. It's cool. When there's a theft, they'resupposed to check the tapes. That's policy. Check on the tapes. Nothing's ever your fault. [computer chimes] MARK: It was you that calledthe other night, wasn't it? You were too scared to say anything. You're a damn coward.

Well, I-- I can't think of no one who'd-- Ma'am? I don't want to accuse nobody of nothing. Mark deserves the most thorough investigation we can give him. Well, there was this guy whoused to work out at the yard. He was messing with the VINs or something. Mark fired him. This was when? Six, seven months ago. But I don't think he would've done nothing.

Well, maybe you ought to. Tanya, this is real life. Mark is dead. Someone killed him. He's dead. [slot machines whirring] [inaudible]. Seen Joe? Is he on tonight? He's supposed to be.

No-- JOE [VOICEOVER]: Anything happens to me, I put all my things in order. They're in a briefcase under my bed. Dear Paula, a man named Mark Sullivan was killed in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago. It was me. I drove there and killed him. Tanya was involved. She helped set it up. I have all the proof. Take it to the police. DETECTIVE: Please make sure Teddy is OK. I love him so much. He's all I have left. I know that doing this is the coward's way out, but I am at my end. I was so blind and so stupid, and so in love. Little did I know she never meant any of it. Joe. Mark's insurance policy--bit of money there-- bored of their life, who knows. Most people don't really need a reason to lie. For some, it's the lie itself they get a charge out of, seeinghow far they can push things, you know? Getting lost in the make believe-- it's still murder, though. Let me them. They look bad. I bought them. Let me see them. [laughing] I can't believe I'm even sleeping with you. Yeah, yeah. [laughs] [knocking] DETECTIVE: Did you evermeet a man in Atlantic City by the name of Joe Donnelly?

But you had a relationship with Joe. Yes. Yes, you did. [sighs] Hm? [sighs] You know what? Online is a game, OK? There is nothing wrong withtalking to somebody online. There is nothing wrong with it. I have a list of people that I talk to. I have probably 50 people that I talk to. I-- I talk to a guy named Dennis. I talked to a guy named Tom. Everyone I have a differentrelationship with. There is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong withsitting and talking back and forth to someone online. Sometimes you say stuff. Come on, everybody does it. Nobody can see.
