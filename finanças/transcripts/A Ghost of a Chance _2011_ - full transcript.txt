I can explain everything. What kind of man... Wait. Let me go. Oh, no. Breakfast? Sorry, no time. My cell phone? I got it... good day. Ah, I'm sorry. I'm starting now. I overslept. Hurry, it's starting. Can't you see? Idiot! You almost killed me Gimme a break! Tell me your name. Shut up, idiot! Your name! You witnessed a person running from the crime scene, right? That is correct. Do you see that person here? That man. You'll be fine. That's all. Sorry I'm late. I'm counting on you. The prosecutor may confront the witness. We'll be fine. We'll be fine. Now I'll examine the witness. Did you really see the culprit? I saw him. Although you were 20 meters away, you saw his face? I can't possibly believe this. I have good eyesight. So... What do you see in my hand? A banana. It looks like a banana to you? This? Isn't it? I see... That's all. But it was a banana. Lawyer! Wasn't it a banana? Show it to me! Your Honor, there's no doubt. It's a banana! What's wrong with calling a banana a banana? The defendant has requested a new lawyer. It seems you can't be trusted. I thought you'd say that. You're a top notch failure. You think I can't hack it? Being a awyer? That's an old issue. You know Mr. Narumi? Like me, he's indebted to your father. I don't know him. This came this morning from his office. This really is your last chance. You'd do that? Don't ruin the name of your father anymore. Thank you very much. I should warn you... It's a burdensome case. You're okay if I take it? Of course, no one else wants to touch it. The victim's name: Yabe Suzuko, 35. She was an art dealer. She was found dead behind her residence. Cause of death: a fall. There are traces of a struggle at her apartment. They found a button that didn't belong to her. Separated from her husband, Yabe Goro. He ran away the next day. Searching his place, they found a jacket with a missing button. The next day, he was found in the Okutama Mountains. He was arrested. He denied everything about the crime. I didn't kill her. I didn't do it! What about your button? Surely there must be an explanation. I have an alibi. What where you doing in the mountains? I wanted to die. My bread factory has to close. I was looking for a place to kill myself. But, I'm still alive, as you see. That day, I ended up at an inn. You didn't go out at all? I couldn't go out. What do you mean? I was immobilized. Immobilized? There was... a ghostly warrior... On top of me. I couldn't move. This man is guilty as charged. Miss Houshou... You must give him the benefit of the doubt. You truly believe he didn't do it? Suppose you were the culprit. Would you make up this "immobilized" alibi? You'd make it more believable, right? In my view, it's likely that he really was immobilized. Didn't I tell you? It's burdensome. Good morning. Good morning. Thanks for your hard work today. You, too. Sitting in court with the daughter of the late Dr. Houshou is a great honor. Please be lenient on me. I remember your father well. He had such stature, even as a young lawyer. Thank you very much. Please go ahead. The defendant has an alibi for the night of the murder. At the estimated time of death, he was staying in Onikirimura. In the room of the Grinding Teeth. There's a record of his stay. No doubt about the record, but he didn't show up until the next day, and no one saw him at the time of the crime. He had ample time to get to the crime scene. And what does the culprit say he was doing? He stayed in his room. Was he asleep? He was immobilized. So he was immobilized... There was a ghostly warrior on top of him. Would you like one? At 11:20 in the morning, if we trust the lawyer's words, the defendant was immobilized in his room. No one saw him, though a hostess checked several times. obviously, he is lying. Why would he lie? If he's lying, he'd make up something more plausible. That's no good. It's gonna be hard if that's your only argument. Furthermore, we'll have to call this warrior ghost to the witness stand. Such an intersting angle! Miss. That's a fine color you're wearing. Where did you buy it? Isetan Department Store. Excuse me, I'd like to go to Shikabane. Shikabane Inn. I know Shikabane Inn. Come. It's right up there. Thank you very much. [Shikabane, right up there] [Ancient site of Kodama War] [Shikabane Inn] Excuse me... Welcome. I'm Miss Houshou from Hayamizu lawyers office. I'd like to talk with the hostess. A lawyer's here to talk to you! Please. Thank you. Thanks... How do you do? I'm Miss Houshou, Mr. Yabe Goro's lawyer. I already told the police everything. You said you peeked in his room several times that night. You didn't see anyone, right? How many times do I have to... My question is about those "several times." Is is common practice to check on your guests like that? We don't do such things! We didn't open the door on purpose. It was opened several times. The door was opened? Hey! It was opened? Didn't I mention that? It's this way. Here. This is the room of the Grinding Teeth. Such a strange name. Kinda spooky. It's the village of the Wandering Warrior, the name's for commercial reasons. Excuse me a moment. I see, this is the room's name. It's easy to confuse. Not at all. In this corridor, there's no other room. What? How about here? The room of the Ringing Ear, out of use. Excuse me, where's the bathroom? Are you done over there? Sorry, just one more thing. Why don't you use the Ringing Ear room? Please, it could be crucial to the case. One hears strange rumors. Don't say it to anyone. Rumors? The customers who stayed here... ...saw it A ghost? The Wandering Warrior. So we closed it before the rumor spread. But wouldn't that help business? No, it would be bad if it spread. It's possible that, on that night, Mr. Yabe went to the bathroom and returned to that room by mistake. This is why, when the hostess peeked, there was no one in his room. I'm sure of it. Excellent, that's a good first step. Because of heavy rainfall, the bus can't run. Then, please call me a taxi. Jun-chan. I gotta go. You hear that? I need to return tonight. Then have a nice walk back home. Bears come out at night. May I have a room please? - Jun-chan. - I'll prepare the room. In that case, may I have 'that' room? The Ringing Ear room? You like a challenge. Enjoy! I'm telling you, I didn't kill her. Besides, we'll have to call the Wandering Warrior to the witness stand. Such an interesting angle! Truly, this is your last chance. You can't keep ruining your father's name. A Wandering Warrior sat on top of me. I couldn't move anymore. If it spread, it would be bad. That smell... On February 24, you sat on a customer here, right? I don't know! Please... look at this. Woman, let me go. Look. Have a good look! Look at it! Do you remember him? Maybe yes, maybe no. I'll ask again. Did you sit on this customer on the night of February 24? Yes... I'm Houshou from Hayamizu lawyers office. I need your testimony in front of the court. Do you understand what I am? I am a ghost. Liar. - I'm not a liar! - Ghosts don't exist. I was a samurai of the House of Houshou. My name is Sarashina Rokubei. So you really died? Would you feel my pulse? Can you hear the 'tac-tac?' Can you hear the 'tac-tac?' So what did you think I was? Stay away! I'm not going to... I'll leave. Sorry. I'm exhausted because of you. What's this about? Say... Don't touch me, woman. Don't touch me. Enough. Even as a ghost, please give your testimony. No way. I beg you. I refuse. Mr. Yabe is gonna be punished for a crime he didn't commit. As it is, he'll be accused of murder. - What did you just say? - What? An innocent man is going to be punished? Yes, that's it. The truth is... I was condemned to death, too. I was beheaded for a crime. - Really? - Really. - But this has nothing to do with your death. Excuse me. Wait! Please tell me. Sit down there. Taiko Hideyosi... was entering this province commanding 200,000 men. Give me a break, I've no interest in history. At the head of his army, he crushed my castle in one day. The Hosho House fell with the castle. As we were fleeing to Odawara, I was killed. The enemy caught up with you? My own people betrayed me... While spreading the rumor that my enemy had killed me. Without even an explanation, they decided that this head... had to fall! This betrayal... I must get revenge! That's how you became a ghost? Yes, and this is the reason why that man... What's his name? Yabe Goro. I perfectly understand his feelings. This is why... so painfully... I understand it. I found an incredible witness! This will win our case. Sounds important. I'll bring him to court now. Now? Do you know the time? When the sun rises, he will disappear. I missed that last part... This is the address of the office and a map. I'll take a cab. Let's meet in 20 hours at the office. But... the thing is... Can't you come with me? But... you're a ghost. Don't you have space-time travel powers? What... are you talking about? What is that? It's nonsense. It's nonsense. I see. Impossible. I could take you there, but... Dressed like that... Sorry for interrupting. I managed to get you a cab. Thanks very much. If you'd be kind enough to pay for your room. If you please. Of course. Why does she ignore you? She cannot see me. This happens quite often. Is that a fact? What's that? Nothing at all, it's fine. Returning so late in the night... Lawyers are very busy people. What is it? It's nothing. The cab will be here in about 10 minutes. Why do some people see you and some don't? Even I don't know. There has to be some secret. Woman, that trial... ...is a trial by jury? That's right. You're very knowledgeable. I see them on the news. You watch TV? There are so many unsavory characters. Some are scary. Say, may I ask you a question? As a Wandering Warrior... why the hairy head? The fact is... My topknot came undone because of the violence of the battle. You Wandering Warriors all have hair like that, so I was wondering. If you don't mind, I'm not a Wandering Warrior I'm so sorry. It's a high-maintenance hairdo. Woman, I need something. Can you stop calling me that? Would you do something for me? What? Could you find me a place to eat and regain some strength? You're hungry? How did you know? I haven't had anything all day. I'm not talking to you. If it's possible, I'd like some tofu. Can't you wait? I'd really like to eat something. Isn't that a Family Restaurant? STOP! STOP! Please ask him... Excuse me. Could we make a stop at Family Restaurant? Is that okay? If we have to, but just a sandwich. If it was possible to have a menu. Have you chosen? A sandwich, please. Please order some tofu. Do you have tofu? Here you can seethe tofu set meal. Then, hold the sandwich and give me that instead. I'll have cinnamon tea. Are you expecting someone else? No. I'm not finished. Let me see. A cheeseburger set. Also, a cheeseburger set with demi-glace sauce. I'm not finished. Carbonara pasta, Japanese style. You can't eat that much. I can. No way. I can. No way. I want Japanese style carbonara. I'm requesting it! And carbonara pasta, Japanese style. As you wish. I haven't eaten all day. Shrimp cream pasta too, please. Please behave! Making that face won't change a thing. Shall I repeat your order? It's fine. Just bring it quickly. I have something to ask of you. If I give testimony, Yabe Goro will be cleared. Yes, most likely. Then what's in it for me? I want my reputation back. Your reputation? Warriors owe each other a "give and take" mutual assistance. Don't be selfish. Shut up. Me, Sarashina Rokubei... killed... without religious rites. Trapped between the living and the dead as a ghost. What can I do for you? A memorial stone. Please erect a memorial stone for me. A memorial stone? Whom can I ask? You're not eating? We eat to stay alive, but I'm already dead. But then... I cannot partake of this meal. So why did you order that much? For the pleasure of my eyes! Their fragrance is my pleasure. Can you see him? That's impolite! That's impolite! My boss is an easy-going person. This meal has given you strength. Yes, certainly. It would be much easier if the boss could see you. This is bad... What do you mean? Although you can't see him, he's right here. Ah, the invisible man. Now, listen... Mr. Rokubei is a witness. He is the warrior who sat on top of Mr. Yabe. He is a ghost. I made a mistake, you are exhausted. I'll give the case to another lawyer. It's not that. Wait, if you'll allow me. - Look. - Yes? - Not you. Mr. Rokubei. This doesn't help, does it... It won't do. It's hopeless. - Wait. - Yes? - Not you. Come here. That drawing is not me at all. You really look funny! Please, I'm asking you. What did you do? Thank you for your time. I'll go now. I'm serious, you need a rest. What's she up to? Chocolate? Today's "norma"... White. It looks so good. He's eating a second one... Introduction to Tap Dance? Miss Hojo, Miss Hojo! What are you doing? Miss Hojo, quick! It's Miss Hojo. Wait... May I come in? Wait! I'm coming in. Ah, wait... I'm on the phone... "Oh, really?" "I see." "Oh really? I see." "Oh, really? Oh, I see." "Yes, I got it." "We'll do it like that." "Please, let's kep in touch." "Goodbye." Come in First, he made a pretend phone call. He also ate chocolates. Boss! The doctor told you to go easy on sweets. What's this? Mr. Rokubei was watching you the whole time. The chocolate's in the lower drawer. Excuse me. What are you doing? It seems you had two of them. A white one and a heart-shaped one. There are no cameras. Mr. Rokubei was watching you the whole time. The Wandering Warrior? What is it now? Boss, have you started tap dance lessons? It's for my health. Don't tell anyone. What now? In front of his eyes. Please sit down, Mr. Rokubei. Usually, can people can see him or not? Usually they can't. But... you plan to call him to the witness stand? Absolutely. - He agrees with it? - Completely. You're all right with it? Absolutely. He's really a ghost? I'm starting to freak out. This trial is going to create a precedent. That is to say, Mr. Rokubei... will stay with us for a little while. Thank you for your hospitality. This is Mr. Kudo Makiyo. He's an actor. An actor? I met him as a legal supervisor on a TV drama. Is he your husband? We aren't there yet. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. You see him? No. But, I trust you. He is there. Such a nice fellow. Could you give me a hand? It'll be quick. During the trial, we need to show the witness. Then, I'd like to take a photo My photo? No, a photo of Mr. Rokubei. I don't get it. You don't need to. These are photos of spirits. I thought I'd proceed like that. Please, Mr. Rokubei. I'm grateful. Photographs of spirits... Are they real? Most of them are real. Is that so? If you made a point system, for the hand, it's 10 points. Then... well, for the face, 50 points. Then, if I move like this, it goes from 1000 to 2000 points. What? I'll tell you later. Okay, I'm taking the photo. For this... Am I... required? It requires a person in front. They're never photographed alone, they seem shy. That's not the reason. Life force is needed, life force. Here we go. ~ I found you that evening ~ ~ In a magic blue moonlight ~ ~ It all started then ~ ~ My new life ~ ~ Once in a blue moon ~ ~ Something happened ~ ~ Once in a blue moon ~ ~ In a blue moonlight ~ ~ Don't get lost ~ ~ It's all fine now ~ ~ Once in a blue moon ~ ~ Ever since I met you ~ ~ We met that evening ~ ~ That person with the amazing hairdo ~ ~ became my new friend ~ ~ Once in a blue moon ~ Hold fast to your promise. My blood is stirring. I'm begging you! Cut! Cut! Checking. Good job. Mr. Rokubei? Right here. If something seem off to you, just say so. All in all, it was quite accurate. He said it was quite accurate. If I had any criticisms, When soldiers are wounded, they die too quickly. Is that right? When they are cut by a sword, they keep living for half a day. What is it? He said that when soldiers are wounded... Makiyo, Makiyo! I got a hold of something great. Is it the corrected script? It's all written here. It also includes my updated lines. Oh yeah, it's great, baby. Your lines are... ...nowhere. My friend, Miss Hosho. Hello. I'm Taiki Murata. Mr. Murata, here you go. All staff, please. Let's make a good scene. Good luck. Thanks! Yosuke! Hold on Why! Cut! Cut! Checking. Yosuke! What a shame! You appeared! You used your points? That will make a good memory. Mr. Rokubei... Who dared stand in front of me?! Show yourself! Where has he gone? Wait a minute! Let's prepare for the next scene. Please! Sarashina Rokubei. I thought you'd know about him, Professor. He was an important person of the Houjou House. In Odawara, he was suspected of collusion with Toyotomi and executed. Why would a lawyer be interested in this? It's related to my job. Prof. Kido researches local history. His research covers this area over a long period of time. Is he famous? - I don't know, I found him on the Net. - Net? On the Net. Please. If you ask me, Rokubei was innocent. Because he had family in the Toyotomi House, he was suspected of collusion. He is so knowledgeable! - That's great! - What? Nothing... I mean... Why would you think Rokubei was innocent? According to the Houjou family record, Rokubei was an outstanding samurai. His soldiers loved him dearly. Actually, this is the only picture left of him. It's Mr. Rokubei! It was preserved! I have never seen such sadness on the face of a general. It's said that Rokubei himself wanted to clear this accusation. There's another reason why I want to prove his innocence. Sarashina Rokubei is my ancestor. Rokubei had a son. Counting from him, I'm the 25th generation. You're my descendant? Professor, this is all I needed to know. I would like to reestablish Mr. Rokubei's good reputation. Would you help me in this endeavor? I don't really know what you mean. Mr. Rokubei... is asking for a memorial stone. Rokubei died 421 years ago. But his soul keeps on living! I really don't like where this is going. Please understand. Mr. Rokubei is right behind you now. He's looking at you right now. Can you see him? He's here now? Yes, right beside you. Not there. Behind... I told you... Here! A little lower... Yes, that's it. You are looking at each other. Do you believe me? Can we talk? Please. Dear Ancestor... My son. My Ancestor! I wanted so much to meet you! Do not cry. The son of a samurai does not shed tears in public. He says a samurai shouldn't cry. I'm not a samurai! In this world, what cannot be established scientifically doesn't exist. You know what that implies? In other words, to say "this exists" is the same as "science can prove it." It's a little difficult. So... the afterlife? Impossible. Superpowers? They're like magic tricks. That is to say, there are no superpowers. How did you do that? The greatest magicians never explain their secrets. Behind each miracle is a trick. I hope you understand. All rise! Court is in session. Public prosecutor, if you please. The defendant, on February 24, 2011, at 11:50 in the morning, in Tokyo, Harbor District, Aosaka 1 Chome, number 21, in Esperanza Residence, apartment 304... The witness, please. Mr. Sarashina Rokubei. Please produce the witness. I'm so sorry, but... The witness has not arrived yet. Please wait just a little bit. How long should we wait? He won't be much longer, I think. Your Honor, when the defense asks for an unjustified delay, the witness called cannot be held as valid. It is totally justified. Pray tell. Please wait a minute. Mr. Rokubei? He cannot come out in the day time. What time does the sun set? 18:58. In 20 hours... I get it, I'll find something. Please. Your Honor, before questioning, I request some time. What do you mean? Objection! Your Honor, the tap dance we just saw isn't related to our case. Is that right? I can't keep them waiting for too long. Your Honor, the defense is wasting the court's time. He's got me. We must resume the questioning. Please wait. I told you he was coming soon. If you can't produce justification... We have to wait until the sun sets. So until the sun sets, this witness... can't take the stand? That's right! - Your Honor... - Your Honor! It's not right to hold the court staff for too long. Just a little more time. Could you grant us a little more time? You did offer a reason. Mr. Prosecutor what do you think? If we have to... So we are going to delay and reconvene when the sun has set. Thank you very much. Has he arrived? It seems so. Let's finish it quickly and get back home. Who would have to wait for sunset? A ghost? I'm the witness that was called. You are in charge of this case, right? I have to wait here, right? A special sitting cushion? Does your bottom hurt? All rise! Court is in session. This way. He's coming. Mr. Yabe Goro. You can count on me. I trust you. Hold out your hands. Don't move. Where is your witness? He is right here. Are you that witness? Not at all, he's sitting right here. Mr. Sarashina Rokubei. Anyone know what all this means? The witness is from the Houjou House. He is well documented in historical records. I offer this as confirmation. Please wait. What are you talking about? The night of the murder, the accused was in Okutama, in the Shikabane Inn. The witness will testify to this. But where the hell is he? Your Honor. Even if he's invisible, he's obvious. Sarashina Rokubei... ...is a ghost. Objection. What the lawyer says doesn't make sense. You are making a mockery of the court. What am I doing? You're holding my sword. The night of the murder, Mr. Rokubei was sitting on the accused, which explains my client's immobilization. He can't possibly have been at the crime scene. Your Honor, how long are they going to play at this farce? This way. Regrettably, only a part of the population can see the witness. But, he IS actually sitting here. And now we are going to prove it. Your Honor! What is that about? Let's have a look. Who is he? The iron sand? It should be okay. Please, Mr. Rokubei. Please, doctor. Raise the level. Raise it more. Stop! This is a trick! Just because a person doesn't have a Japanese passport, to reject his testimony is unheard of! It's not as if he's a foreigner. Your Honor, their is no scientific proof that ghosts exist! this testimony is unacceptable in front of a court. You really don't have a clue. There is no afterlife! Where is your witness right now? Standing by your side, your Honor. Mr. Rokubei! I'm a bit tired. Thank you for your kind service. He thanks you! He's following you. Please, your Honor. How about we just listen to what he has to say? Your Honor! It could help solve the case. Let's just see what comes of it. Thank you very much! But we can't even hear his voice. How about you? I'll convey what he says. I'll be his spokesperson during the trial. You really plan to have a ghost speak... He was a human being! Precisely! This is preposterous! Please state your name. Mr. Sarashina Rokubei. Date of birth, please. 3rd day of the Tiger moon, the year 1530. This makes me 481 years old! This makes me 481 years old! Objection! This is simply an act played by the lawyer. How long are we to endure this comedy? How rude of you! Obviously, there's no witness. I request an end to this line of questioning. Miss Hosho, couldn't we have a direct utterance from the witness? Please wait. I request that the witness be rejected. What should we do? Don't give up. There has to be another way. That's it... This is it! Mr. Rokubei, please blow through this. Your Honor, he can communicate using this. Is he blowing through it? Objection! What is your name? This is obviously a trick. It's not a trick! May I see that? Yes, your Honor. There's no trick. Do you see, your Honor? It can't go 'beep-beep' on it's own. This can't be counted as speech. Your Honor, how about this. When we ask a question, he beeps once for "yes," twice for "no." I like that. Did you hear? Okay, let's do that. Here. Me? Lower, much lower. Are you Mr. Sarashina Rokubei? Let's try a "no" question. Are you an evil spirit? Are you a ghost? This is so interesting! Your Honor, the court is not a circus. I'm sorry. Every proof you bring must be subjected to scientific tests. We must stick to pure facts for the trial to proceed. There is no room here for supernatural performances. This is a fact! The testimony of a dead person is not admissible in court! You dumb-witted... Mr. Rokubei is necessary to ... Miss Hosho. This guy's such a jerk! There, there. Listen to this. It's quite possible that he can see me. Mr. Osano? Just before, our eyes met and he reacted. No way. Let's try it. Absolutely. Please listen to me, ladies and gentlemen. what is happening in this court goes against common sense. This court... This court is a place were the truth must be established. Whether witnesses or the accused, everything they say must lead to the truth. What kind of nonsense is that? You think anyone's listening? ...what you can see for yourself, what you can hear \... Even things you don't see exist, too. Now wait a minute, you don't need to hear... You can trust things that... Shut up! I'm the one talking! What got into you? So, you can hear his voice. And you can see him too, right? Excuse me. You can see me, right? If I make this face, you can see it, right? That face... Your Honor, I ask for a recess. It's the first time a ghost appeared so clearly. This is a new era where the Great Beyond and our world can meet. I will never admit the existence of ghosts. They are turning the court into a circus! I strongly oppose this. Dear viewers, do you think this is acceptable? What is he blabbering about when he can see him for himself? How come I can't see him? This is the point! There has to be a pattern. Those who saw him up 'til now... Me, the accused, the guy in the restaurant, the lady we saw in the street, then prosecutor Osano. They have to have something in common. Someone else can see him. I just drew what I saw. Mr. Himura, you were the only artist present in the court who saw him. I don't know about that. What's your point? Why do some see him and others don't? Do you have an idea? I don't see how I could help you. We must have something in common. You and me? At first glance, I really don't see any thing in common. As for me and Mr. Yabe, recently our work situations haven't been too good. How about you? How dare you! I'm sorry. The fact is... my situation is bad, too. Soon I'll lose my job as court illustrator. I specialize in drawing the fantastic aspects of the world. Here is my book. It's great. But, one has to earn a living. That's true! But there are many people whose jobs are in jeopardy. Have you felt closer to death lately? Mr. Yabe wanted to die. A month ago, a truck almost ran me over. How about it? Last week, my little parakeet Pee-chan died. I was in a truck accident last month. My freight was damaged. The next day, my wife ran away. Poor guy. Besides that, your father died half a year ago. My sincere condolences. How about you? My pimp betrayed me. He sold me to a strip club to pay his debts. Then there was a fire in the club, and you nearly perished. I don't need your compassion! All of us have been down on our luck lately. We felt closer to death. I could say the same for me. I keep losing my cases. And 2 months ago, I had a life-threatening disease. Yet, I don't see Mr. Rokubei. You can't see him? Is that bad? Surely we have something else in common. Come in. Excuse me. Oh, the tea's here. Let's pause for a bit. Okay, let's enjoy a tea break. Who wants a cinnamon tea? It would be so much easier to admit it. I don't get it. Mr. Rokubei. Okay. You like Indian food? What's it to you? What do you like about Indian food? The spices? Don't bother me. I especially hate being disturbed when I eat. As my research proves, there are 3 conditions for seeing ghosts. First: You've been out of luck lately. Second: You've come close to death lately. Then, Third: You love cinnamon. To me, cinnamon tea is a daily routine. Mr. Yabe had cinnamon bread made at his factory. It would appear that cinnamon... has the power to attune people to the other world. Really, I'm not interested. But it gets more interesting. Mr. Osano. It seems your marriage is in trouble. My sympathies. What are you getting at? She told you to be a man and leave. Lately, you're out of luck. None of your business. Then 2 months ago, you lost your beloved Labrador, Labu-chan. Run over in traffic. I'm sorry for your loss. Let's stop this conversation. You felt death drawing near. Then, the spicy Indian food. The main spice ingredient of Masala sauce is cinnamon. You can see Mr. Rokubei, can't you? I must repeat, the Other World doesn't exist. I will never, ever admit it! Mr. Rokubei, if you please. Look, Labu-chan, your master. There, there, go. Labu... Labu! Labu! Mr. Rokubei made a return trip to the Beyond to bring him here. Mr. Rokubei did? Thank you for your trouble. I found him unexpectedly. He was playing with Hachiko. You idiot, what where you doing? Didn't I tell you a hundred times? Don't run out into the street! It's dangerous there. You do love him. He is my only treasure. Okay, okay... Enough now, enough! No, you're too heavy. Mr. Osano. Please, Mr. Osano. Enough. It's time to go. I'm sorry. Labu... Labu... Sorry I had to do that. That was cruel. I hadn't see him since his death. But finally, I could say goodbye. Does Mr. Rokubei stand as a witness? Will you admit him? If he testifies, you'll have to let me cross-examine him. Of course. He won't receive special treatment as a ghost. Please tell him. Thanks a lot! "A ghost witness on the stand" How are we going to win this case? What are we gonna do with that witness? Don't fret. I'll find a way. Please, come in. Sorry for interrupting. I'm Abe no Seimei, the great exorcist. The unsurpassed heir of 35 generations of shamans. You can call me Abe no 'Chika-chika.' What is your plan? Mr. Rokubei, their witness. We will exorcise him from this world. You can count on Chika-chika. The eyes of the whole nation are on the "Ghost Trial," where the defense has chosen to bring a Ghost Warrior as a witness. As you can see, hundreds of people are lining up. What's with the hairdo? I was aiming for a more modern look. It's absolutely weird. There's an unfamiliar person over there. Although the entrance is guarded. I was concerned about his hairdo, too. You can see him? I'm Danda Jouji from the Office of Public Safety. Obviously, I come from the Other World. Sarashina Rokubei. I have an order for your return. Please come with me. Wait a minute! Miss, maybe it's time for you too to lower your expectations. I'm sorry. We're going. Mr. Rokubei's just about to testify. You'll find another witness. It's a bad time to return. They are very upset upstairs. An innocent man is about to be condemned. - I'm imploring you to wait. - Let's go. This witness is requested to establish the truth in this case. Please wait outside We don't abide by the laws of your world. You're in this world's tribunal now. Mr. Osano, this person cannot be disobeyed. You shut... ...up. Antagonizing my person means exposing yourself to harsh reprisal after your passing. Do I look like a person liable to yield to your threats? Until the truth is established, we cannot deliver that gentleman. Please leave. You are an interesting character. If you compel him to depart, I'll officially oppose it. It doesn't matter who hears me. But if things turn bad, it will all land on your shoulders. With this cross-examination, I intend to crush their case intoto rubble. It's not like you're in a hurry. Fine, then. Let's see you prove your mettle. Thank you for your cooperation. If you'll excuse me. Although you're the opposing team, I have to applaud. Why did you help us? Let's be clear, we are not enemies. We are both trying to establish the truth. Our only enemy is the veiling of the truth. See you in court. Miss Hosho, you may question the witness. On the night of the murder, February 24... Stop right there! Please be quiet in the audience! I'm an eminent exorcist. Abe no Seimei. Unsurpassed heir of 35 generations of shamans. Abe no Chika-chika! Enough with your circus! Take him outside! Don't touch me! Evil Spirit, I will expel you! These guys really test my patience. Take this. Ah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Excuse me. Are you going? Chika-chika, are you going? Please resume. Such powers, he's amazing. On the night of the murder, you were in Shikabane Inn in the Ringing Ear room, correct? Blow in the harmonica once for "yes" and twice for "no." In the said room, you sat on a person 'til morning? Is the person you sat on in this courtroom? Please point to him. So it is Yabe Goro, the accused? Defense rests. I'll now question the witness. On the night of the 24th, you were sitting on the accused in the Ringing Ear room, correct? Why did you do that? You've done it before to others. Why do you do this? Objection! The witness is supposed to answer "yes" or "no" only. In order for the trial to proceed, I need complete answers. It's gonna take time. Miss Hosho, would you mind conveying the words of your client? As you wish. Let's resume. Mr. Rokubei, why do you sit on people? Mr. Rokubei is confused. Please urge your client to answer. Why do you haunt places? I never gave it a thought. Without rhyme or reason, you scare people? - Well, obviously, being a ghost... - That is no justification! Being a ghost, I can't help it. What did he say? Being a ghost, he can't help it. So he offers no reason why he sat all night on the accused. A human being sitting all night on a person with no reason... I'm a ghost... Yet you were a human being! How much can we trust such a witness? He is really, really annoying. Furthermore, to better establish the credibility of the witness... You're good at that. Mr. Rokubei died in 1590. In 1590. It is recorded in Odawara history. I ask you this question... What was the cause of your death? Objection, this has nothing to do with our case! It's important to establish his existence. Let's proceed a little more. How did you pass from this world? I was beheaded. Please say it louder. I was beheaded! Miss Hosho? He was beheaded. Which means you were sentenced to death. Why did you receive this sentence? He doesn't need to answer... I will answer in his stead. You leaked intelligence to the enemy. You lead your people to their destruction. It was treason. That's not true! This is written in history books. Sarashina Rokubei betrayed his house. What is written in history books is not necessarily true! It is recorded in Odawara history books. I'm the one who was betrayed! Your Honor, Mr. Rokubei is a human who was betrayed by his own. But records tell us that's a lie. How can he be trusted? This is all I have to say. Whether the witness is a ghost or a human, whether he is alive or dead, we really don't care. What is most essential to this court is the credibility of the witness. And in the context of this case, he is found to have none. Prosecution rests. This is so regrettable. Forget about it. In these 421 years, I wished someone would understand. Suspected of treason... I was betrayed, it's so regrettable. That's what you should have told them. You saw how suddenly he asked his questions. How do we proceed from here? We have to present another witness to the court. We need an authoritative historian to back him up. Anyone in mind? Yes, we have. Odawara history certainly alleges Mr. Rokubei colluded with the enemy. Yet, according to my studies, Mr. Rokubei did not pass intelligence to the Toyotomi. You mean there's no proof of treason? Certainly not! Precisely. He was unjustly condemned. Exactly! Objection, this is all conjecture. Mr. Rokubei was an outstanding warrior. Since his childhood in Kotama Castle, he was dearly loved. He received his battle surcoat directly from the lord of the castle. This is the surcoat. Your Honor, this is the surcoat. I offer this surcoat as a proof of my excellent references. Prosecution? As a head of the Houjou family, Mr. Rokubei was well-respected. That is a fact. He befriended Oda Nobunaga, another traitor. Do not compare me to him! As you know, in recorded history, Mr. Rokubei is described as colluding with traitors. Do you wish to ignore this fact? That is absolutely incorrect. It's recorded in trusted documents. You believe all documents are trustworthy? You intend a revision of historical documents? These are falsified... If they are, you must prove it! You don't know the proceedings of a trial! I'll kill him... Prosecution rests. You don't know the first thing about history! History contains alterations! Witness, please be seated. - Osano... - Don't come any closer. Mr. Rokubei, Mr. Rokubei! Stop! Don't do it! Don't... Ah, I'm unharmed. Don't do... Ah, I'm fine. We haven't lost it all yet. You never know the outcome of a battle until it's over. But this Osano... The jurors seem to be listening to what he's saying. Don't mind them. Here's some comfort food. Mr. Rokubei too, even just for the fragrance. I'm grateful. Don't talk about what you can't understand. The court and the actor's scene are similar. The lawyer is an actor, and the judge is the audience. If you don't move the audience's heart... That's enough! What do you know about that, Makiyo? Have you played an role that moved the audience's heart? Wait, wait, just wait a minute. Makiyo is only trying to help. Did I hurt you? Look, he's crying now. Hey! Makiyo! Mr. Rokubei. I must apologize. What for? All your efforts to testify... It must be so hard on you. Not at all. Rather, it's me who has proved useless. No, you did a great job. What is it? It would be better if we lived apart for a while. Hey, wait... Right now you're very busy with this case. You're angry. - I'm not. - You're angry. I'm not. But... if we keep on like this, we're gonna hate each other. I'm sorry. I wanted to hear that a long time ago. He's the worst! Can you tell me why people stopped believing in the Other World? My father died when I was 10. Cancer. It must have been painful for you. My father loved me. However busy he was, he would always take time to listen to me. He would often take me on walks when I was little. I can still remember. When he was in a good mood, he would always sing "10,000 Feet Up the Alps." ("Yankee Doodle Dandy") Why did he like it? Even as an adult, when I feel down, I talk to him. Please, father, help me from heaven. He's never answered once. However sad I was, I couldn't here my father's voice. It's only natural to not believe in heaven. I'm sure your father always thought of you. Then why doesn't he answer? If he could, he would. But we don't have such power. We are just like farts. We can only stink. But even a fart is better. I had so much sadness. Your father's always known it. I know that for a fact. But... Please be at peace. I know your father can see you. Even now? Yes, even now. No time to get depressed. The trial is not lost yet. Surely not. The fight is only starting. I have to try as if there is no tomorrow. Miss Houshou. When you put your mind to it, you never give up. That's an admirable quality. What is this? But if something is lacking in you, it would be self-confidence. If you can't trust yourself, who shall you trust? Such kind words. Miss Emi, from this moment, I ordain you Princess Emi. No way! Why not? I'm not a princess. I'm rehearsing for a play. Is there something wrong? Nothing... As for me, I will never surrender! I'll crush you just like this! What do you mean? Well, it's my trial. Sure it is. Lately, I feel neglected. Mr. Yabe, no one is neglecting you. It's your trial. But it's all revolving around that Ghost Warrior. Not at all. If Mr. Rokubei's reputation is cleared, you will... I understand that. But if the Other World really exists, Why not just call my late wife? Her testimony would prove undeniably that I didn't kill her. His wife? You managed to bring Mr. Osano's dog. How about Mr. Yabe's wife? The victim herself could testify. What better witness can we ask for? How could I miss that? Please. Leave it to me. I just came back. I made a return trip. You know, this world and the other don't have the same timing. So, how did it go? You have to understand, I did everything I could. Since the dawn of civilization, gazillions of people have died. Even neanderthals crowd the place. To find just that one person... It's impossible! What about Osano's dog? Billions of dogs have died, too. In the case of Labu-chan, he had such a strong drive to find his master, he came out himself. For now, please keep searching. We have nothing else. Okay, I'll try. This is from the director Frank Capra, right? "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," a 1939 silent movie starring James Stewart and Jean Arthur. I didn't think you'd like Capra. It's not mine. It was my late father's favorite. It's the story of a young man striving for justice. Your father was a great person too, right? Of course. As for me, my favorite Capra film is "It's a Wonderful Life." It's a good movie, too. Why are you singing this song? It's in "Mr. Smith goes to Washington." Didn't you watch it? Well, shall we call it a day? The trial's not over yet. It's thoroughly settled, you lost. I haven't lost yet. If you still oppose me, I could take you along with us. Miss... Oh the pinky, the pinky, he's sticking up the pinky finger! Please leave it to me! I'm sooooorrryyyyyyy... Oh, he's flying higher and higher... I must say goodbye. I have one last request. The young lady is a tough bargainer. I ask only for 3 hours. Did I just hear you right? There's a place I need to take Mr. Rokubei. Move aside. If you don't mind waiting, you could watch this movie you like. If you don't mind waiting, you could watch this movie you like. If you don't mind waiting, you could watch this movie you like. You seem to understand my soft spot. Right? We can travel riding the wind, but we can't use remote controls. We'll be back in 3 hours. No, I'll only wait for 2 hours 9 minutes. The runtime for "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." This was the site of a fierce battle. The landscape hasn't changed in 400 years. Hey there! - We'll erect the memorial stone right here. - Memorial stone? It's in your honor. As you can see, the professor remembers our promise. So kind of you to help me. He is grateful and filled with joy. This is so important. It's my turn to fulfill my promise. I can finally rest in peace! What is it? I thought I heard a cry. Is it Mr. Rokubei? Maybe the wind howling. Probably. A samurai doesn't cry. Right. You brat... Mr. Rokubei is laughing. You brat! Enough now. I wish you the best. Very soon... I will die. I couldn't do much. I regret it. All this, we owe it to you. But for you, the fight is only starting. I'll pray for your success in battle. Thank you. Trust in yourself. Of course! Why couldn't Mr. Rokubei find Mrs. Yabe Suzuko? That was strange. What's your point? Maybe... Are you you all right? You're eating sweets in the middle of the night. Give me a break. What if Mrs. Suzuko... is still alive? What's this? Mrs. Suzuko's body was cremated as soon as it was delivered to her family. Her elder sister, Hino Fuko, supervised the cremation. She seems suspicious to me. She is Suzuko's only blood relative. According to Mr. Yabe, they never got along. Lately, it got worse. What's your point? It's not Suzuko who died, but her sister Fuko. You mean Suzuko... ...killed her sister and took her place. You won't go far with such theories. In any case, I'll go to meet Hino Fuko. Sorry I kept you waiting. Since Suzuko died, my wife can't stop crying. I'm sincerely sorry. She was her last blood relative. You live in a wonderful place. So many plants. My wife has a passion for gardening. She tends to them herself? She does. She insists that no one else touch them. Please wait. Fuko. Miss Hosho is visiting. I don't feel like meeting anyone. Don't be silly, she came for you. You'll be fine, just talk to her as you are. Wipe your tears already. Miss. Miss Hosho, the lawyer. My wife. Pleased to meet you. That man killed my sister. He himself denies it. Obviously a lie. He was always a criminal, he can't even hold a job. This worthless man did that to my sister. Why can't you see the truth? Fuko! Please stop that. Sorry, I lost my temper. I understand your feelings. I'm sorry. She loved her sister from the bottom of her heart. I saw her sister only in photos. They really do look alike. Really? I never thought of it. By the way, what was the purpose of your visit? It's okay now. What I heard is amply sufficient. They are the culprits, no doubt. She pretends she loved her sister. She hasn't shown up in court at all. No one is tending to those plants anymore. I'm sure she's Suzuko. Mr. Rokubei couldn't find her in the Other World, so she's not dead. The person we should look for there is Fuko. Please leave the room! Massage the heart! Catecholamine! Is he that bad? He's not coming back. Boss! I need to ask you something. When you're on the other side, ask for Mr. Danda at the Office of Public Safety. Then tell him the story. I won't remember... You're not supposed to talk to a person like this! Please convey this to Mr. Danda! Without fail! I'm counting on you. 9:53 am. Time of death. This is bad. Boss! I didn't think I'd go that way. Had I known, I would have listened to my doctor. Be strong! He came to get me. I'm begging you, Hino Fuko is in the Other World. Please let me meet her. If there's any way. And the note you wrote? Did you read it? If you show me Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life." I'll get it right now from the supermarket. Dammit... One last time, I wanted to eat Tenichi Ramen. - Shall we go? - Go? I'll accompany you to your place. Please bring Mrs. Fuko first. I'll send someone to fetch her. "It's a Wonderful Life" has a 130 minute runtime. If we don't go quickly, the sun will set. The day following the event, you wanted to die. You went to the mountains and there you were arrested. Yes. What happened then? They told me my wife was dead, and the police took me in. Then you identified the body. But they arrested you after... Yes. Are you sure the body was your wife's? Maybe. Why "maybe?" It was the first time I saw a corpse. You didn't take a good look? It didn't feel right to. Objection! The defense's purpose is not clear. It's quite possible that the body was someone else's. What's this crazy idea? I intend to prove it now. Objection, this is not a fact that can be proven. Could we hear the defense a little further? Please go ahead. Thank you very much. The fact is, apart from the defendant, another person identified the body. Her sister, Fuko. Your Honor, today, in this court, she finally came. I'm so grateful you came. You ordered me to. Your Honor! I think it's necessary to listen to Fuko Hino's testimony. Objection! No, I want to hear it, too. Please take the stand. If you don't comply, you become a suspect. When's the last time you saw your sister? Must have been 2 years ago, at her wedding. It seems you got along well with your sister. Certainly. Since she died, you must be feeling terrible. Her death left a void in my heart. You two were so close. Why then didn't you meet her for 2 years? Objection, this is pointless. I have a question! Did you know your sister had an affair? No, I didn't. Seems she had a lover. First time I heard of it. She wanted out of their marriage. But she couldn't afford her affair to be the cause for divorce. Objection! What's the lawyer's purpose? I'll explain. Say it now! Please, Miss. Isn't it time to produce your evidence? The defendant had no motive to kill his wife. Rather... Suzuko wanted Mr. Yabe to disappear. What are you talking about? All of it, all of it! Was the plan of Mrs. Yabe Suzuko, the wife. Quiet, please! Quiet in the audience! Mrs. Fuko, why did you send your sister's body to be cremated right away? What kind of question... Maybe you didn't want anyone to see the body. Not true. Why didn't you show up in court even once before? I was so busy... Why are you wearing sunglasses? My eyes are sensitive. Why don't you ever look at the accused? What do you want from me? You are not... Mrs. Hino Fuko. Please be quiet! What did you say? You are her sister Suzuko. You killed your sister and took her place. Sir, here is your wife! Suzuko? Don't say a word! What is this farce? Order in the court! You are the real culprit. Don't speak nonsense! You there, say something! You're supposed to be the prosecutor! Object now! No objection. I suppose you have facts to back up what you said? I'm exposing them now. Sit down. Do you like cinnamon? You... are the one who killed me? Witness? What do you see? Nothing at all. The victim is right there! The victim? Mrs. Fuko, please tell us who killed you. Without a doubt, this woman did! Stop! What did she say? I can't hear! You certainly have heard it. Direct testimony from the victim. What did the victim say? She unequivocally pointed to her murderer. That woman there. This is the ultimate witness. Thank you very much. Suzuko... It's you? Believe me, I had no intention of killing her. It suits you to say so. "The Ghost Trial: A sudden turn of events" We declare... the defendant... not guilty. Thank you for all your help. Now we've had a trial with a deceased witnesses. It defeats the very idea of a trial. Mr. Danda said this would be an exception. Really? But that's too bad. It would be so much simpler if the deceased victim could testify, right Mr. Osano? Assuming the Other World exists, you mean. You're still on about that? As it is, ghosts don't exist. So all those you've just seen? Collective hypnosis. Thank you for your hard work. Excuse me. Miss Hosho. A trial is not about winning, but you did well this time. Thank you very much. Your behavior in court reminded me of your father at times. I'm sure he rejoices looking at you from heaven. Thank you very much... for everything. But remember this, a trial is not about winning. Hopefully we'll meet again in court. Thank you for your hard work. A trial is not about winning. I get it. Princess, you did a good job. I saw it all. You earned your forgiveness from Mr. Danda. You did an amazing job. Princess? Today, I came here to meet you. I thought you'd rejoice to see me, too. I found him immediately. Who do you think I'm talking about? Well, are you ready to meet him? Here he comes! Emi... Long time no see. I'm your father. What happened? What happened? Well... It seems there's nothing we can do. "10,000 Feet Up the Alps." But it's Yankee Doodle Dandy. It's only the Japanese title, but the same tune. Father? Father... are you there? Mr. Rokubei accompanied you here? Excuse me. Father, I wanted to meet you. So did I. Mother... ...re-married. Did you know? So you keep watch on us. Always? You'll keep watching? Certainly. You're not alone. So, I'm not alone. How is the Other World? It's full of surprises. For example? It can't be expressed in words. You'll have to experience it for yourself. Just tell me a little, just a little. I should have told you long ago. You don't get my figure right at all. I'm not drawing portraits. Couldn't you make my nose a little more graceful? So annoying. Who said there was an end? Come down. "Perfect and Complete" Thank you very much! Thanks.
