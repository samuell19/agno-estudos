Good boy Dino! Yeah! Good boy Dino. Good boy. Keep that fucking thing away from me! You know why we're here. Where is it? I don't have it. Mmm. You don't have it huh? You fucking scum bag! We know you have it. Where's the journal? Ha! I fucking ditched it. Your never going to find it asshole! Ritchie. You always knew this day was coming. Now if you don't tell us where it is, we're going to find your daughter and we're going to make her tell us. We're going to make her tell us where it is. Good fucking luck. Huh? You don't even care about your own daughter? I said good fucking luck. Good luck to you. "The world is still reeling off the announcement of possible intelligent life discovered by NASA scientists last week. German astrophysicists confirming the findings today". "We observe today, not a victory of body, but a celebration of freedom. Symbolizing an end..." What's wrong with you? Hey Mase! Don't worry about Sal. Will you stop with Sal? Let me buy you one of those fancy scotches. Hey, what is it Lagafeild? Lagavin? Lagavulin. Hey Mase. I want you to do me. You never call me! Fuck! ("Good night my friend.") Goddamn Sal. I don't know how they do it in South America. But in this great country, midnight means midnight! Don't beat me up my friend. You call last minute, I arrive last minute. You'd be sucking dicks in Rickers for 300 years if it wasn't for me. Just give me my shit. I acknowledge all your valor my friend. But this is ancient history we're talking about. You haven't been an agent for years. But you still call, I still come. Every time. I have over head you know. Get the fuck out of here. This is the last time anyway. Okay okay, my friend. Mason damn it! Really? Again? Dealing with that slim ball? And you had to do it here? I wish you would have locked that guy up when you had the chance. Someone will do it eventually. It's inevitable. Yeah? Well it can't happen soon enough. Jean Teally O.D'd a month ago. You can not trust Sal. Yeah, Okay. That shit is going to kill you one day. I am too dead all ready to kill. Jesus Christ! This isn't my fault and you know it! I'll kick it. How's your father? He's been laying low. Kind of like you. Whenever Richard Cory went down town, We people on the pavement looked at him: He was gentlemen from soul to crown, Clean favored, and imperially slim. And he was always quietly arrayed, And he was always human when he talked; But still he flooded pulses when he said "Good-Morning", And he glittered, glittered, when he walked! And he was rich. Oh! Oh oh yes! Yes! Richer than a king, And admirably schooled in every grace: In fine, we thought he was everything to make us wish we were in his place. And so we worked, we worked! And waited for the light, And went with out meat, and cursed the bread; And Richard Cory, one summer night, went home and put a bullet through his head. All right tell me again about Valenzuela. Where's Dino? He's in the back getting... Was I fucking talking to you?! Dino's in the back getting washed up. He got a little messy. You follow him for half the night and you can't get him alone? He could barely walk for Christ's sake! Boss, we were watching him for hours. I said shut the fuck up! For the second time, shut the fuck up! God you piss me off! He went to see his daughter at Gina Marie's like he does every Thursday night. We saw the journal. He took it out. The guy drank twenty espresso's. No bathroom break. He gets up, He leaves. In two seconds he's in a cab. Then what? He gets dropped off at a book store on Alex. People every where. Lights every where. Goes inside orders another coffee. So jacked up on caffeine, he just hobbled away? He has had a bullet in his leg from 10 years ago. I know. I put it there. I think he made us at that point. You think he made you, huh? Goes to a book store he knows better than his dick. Gets more coffee so you know he's got to piss. Goes into a bathroom he's been in a million times before. Wait a second... You know you may be right. He might have made you. Well, we caught up to him. Oh what a fucking great job. Oh sure, you caught him. You caught him. As a matter of fact you killed him. What a great job. And you killed him. You killed him! You killed the only guy in the world who knows where my 8 million bucks of smack is. Ritchie ain't never talked his whole life. You know that. He obviously ditched the journal at The Eagle or at the bookstore. All right here's what your going to do. You're going to go back to the bookstore. Then you're going to go into the alley. If you don't find it, then Dino is going to have another big meal. It ain't going to be Alpo. Get out of here. Hey Boss, I got one more... Welcome. I am Anna Falactic and we are here with Doctor Gestim. Perhaps the worlds foremost astrophysicist's and esteemed business man. Thank you for being here. Doctor, I for one am in shock, about this discovery which may be the most profound in our history. I am only glad I have lived long enough to see it. Can we really see it doctor? Or them? Isn't it just light waves at this point. Well, it maybe much more than that. Let us consider what is known. The star that could be considered this planets sun, is approximately 40 light years away. That is 250 trillion miles. It gives off a tremendous amount of light which obscures the view of the tiny planet in question. Okay doctor, when will we know for sure that we have found this intelligent life? The hard proof. Well at this point we can only study the atmosphere of the planet with the HARPS spectrograph. Using different filters and instruments soon, we may have a more concrete analysis of the atmosphere. To see if it can sustain intelligent life. When will we know for sure? Well, if we had a physical presence on the planet. And if we could capture a sample of the atmosphere, to send back to you, you know, at the speed of light. I could tell you for sure... in 40 years. Why me? Frankly Detective, not only were you my first pick, you're my only pick. And you're saying only four people will know I am undercover? It's a big deal to settle. I know it's asking a lot. I got a reputation on the street. You think they're going to go for this? I hope there isn't a folded flag in this for me when it's over. It's going to be expensive. Millions. You just going to print that money out? This is where I come in. That shit is going to kill you one day. Fuck this shit. Fuck. You checked the book store yourself right? Huh? You didn't send in that rocket scientist. I went in myself. Looked in every isle. Went to the bathroom, tore it apart. Nothing. So asshole, what happened? Couldn't find nothing boss. I even went in there and smacked around the book clerk a little bit. You know what I am saying? I guaran-fucking-tee you he don't know nothing. I went back to The Eagle, checked out every inch of The Eagle and the alley way. Nothing but junkies. Fucking Valenzuela. I bring him in on this job and he steals from me. He fucking steals from me! Steals from me. Hmm. You know what? I just had a thought. He passed the book off to his daughter. Maybe he just told the girl where the merchandise is, so he can sell it and get the money. He wouldn't tell her. That would put her in jeopardy. Ritchie was a smart S.O.B. Two geniuses I got here. Find the girl, and find the book. Let's find out where she lives and we'll meet her there. Perfect. Gives you enough time to clean up the dog shit. Fucking dog shit. That's your job. Feeling good. I need help. Fucking mutt! Keep the one pound shits too you fucking cock sucker! Fucking nice! Good little doggy. It's 2 in the morning! Who is this? It's Mase. Please... Please let me in. Oh god no no. No fucking way. I told you never to come here when your on this shit! No. I... I stopped. Okay. Come on. We got to get you to the bedroom. I am so thirsty. What the hell was that? Allow me to formally introduce ourselves. My name is Vincenzo R. Dictive and this is my compatriot, Amil Avril Nitrate. We are friends of you fathers. I know who you dick-wads are. My father kept some lousy company but, you guys are pathetic. What are you doing here? You know why we're here. The journal. What journal? What the hell are you talking about? That's a pretty hot outfit you got on. You ever think about wearing that to The Spread Eagle? Your fathers little fucking journal that he passed along to you. He didn't give me a journal. He did. He didn't. We saw him take out his little fucking journal... Wait. Are you sick fucks following me? Yeah. He had the journal at the restaurant. But he always does. And slipped it to you. No he didn't! We'll see about that. We're going to take a walk to the bedroom, have a little look see. We know what you were wearing tonight. Hey. I got a question. You ever give anybody a little lap dance outside the alley way of The Eagle? Mason Jars... You don't look so good. Whats he doing here? He's doing his taxes. You know he comes over, takes his clothes off, get's on the bed and starts doing his taxes. It's crazy. Shut up! Amil, take a look at the great Mason Jars. Back up, funny girl. The great Mason Jar. A fucking junkie. I can tear this place apart and do the same to you. Either way your going to tell me where that book is. You know your father, has made some very bad decisions in life. Yeah? Like what? Like stealing eight million dollars worth of heroin from Alphonse Dente. You fucking whore! That's what... Honey. Don't call me that. I don't know anything about the heroin But I am not surprised. Fucking Ritchie. He couldn't be happy with a quarter of a million, he had to have it all. Now I am pissed. I am getting really fucking pissed. Where's the book? I don't know! Give me the fucking journal, you fucking whore! I'll fucking blow your head off! I am fucking shot Vin! Vin! I am really shot! Take it easy. Get up. Get over here. Take it easy? I am fucking shot Vin! I see your shot. We'll patch you up. Think the boss is going to mad? Shut-up. Keep moving. Okay. Either way, we will get that book. Doctor, what do you mean by Antares is a super red giant? The star, Antares, is massive. In fact, it is 800 times larger than our own sun. It's size and reddish color categorize it as a red super giant star. It is so large, that if it were placed in the center of our solar system where our sun is, it would eclipse the orbit of Mars! Is Antares the reason why we haven't seen the newly discovered planet MD10835. No Antares has obscured MD10835 from our view from earth until now. Our orbiting position needed to be correct. Okay. So that's the reason we can receive these light pulses of information? Precisely. About 92 percent of the time, the planet is directly behind Antares. Completely blocking it from our view. So what of this intelligent life? I mean, do they want us to find them? What kind of fuel do they use? These are the kind of questions that I need you to answer. How do you feel? Kinda like that song. Some night huh? Thank you. I never would have made it without you. I'd be dead. Dead again. You wouldn't have made it without me again. And I should probably say the same to you. Who were those guys? They knew you. Now they know me better. Mase. I think my father is dead. One of the guys from last night, I see him sometimes at the Spread Eagle. He comes busting in here, flashing a magnum, and sporting my dad's blue star sapphire ring. I mean I would know that ring anywhere. My father ran in some unsavory circles. Some drug kingpin named Dente sent them over. My father stole something. Something big. Dente. He was selling on street corners. Shaking down pimps. Street tough though. Real bad news. When I was undercover, I used him to get to his bosses. He's a kingpin now? What's your father doing with scum like that? Well, I never told you this. But... when a job was going down my father would be the guy to acquire and read schematics, plan escape routes and stuff. He knew how to time traffic lights and stuff like that. Do you know what they were after? Heroin. What he took, what's probably in that journal, is the location of millions of dollars worth of heroin. My dad's probably lying in an alley right now. And they're just not going to stop until they find that damn journal. Journal. Where'd you get that? That's my dad's journal. What the hell are you doing with it? Found in the back alley of The Eagle last night. Found something under my seat. I just pulled it out. I didn't think much of it. I just took it and headed home. I was in bad shape if you remember. My dad died for that journal. He crossed off his jobs one by one. Kept the information coded incase the authorities ever got a hold of it. If he did hide the drugs, maybe he moved them. And he crossed off the hints to the prior hiding spots. Hey. They're right. Who's right? Right about what? Dente and his thugs. They're right. Now you do have the journal. Can't believe Jars isn't dead yet. Fucker over dosed twice all ready. He's got more lives than a damn cat. Oww! You all right? Yeah. I am okay. Hey, maybe the chicken flinched. I know I did. Maybe you need to get your eyes examined or something. Shut the fuck up. What do you think Vin? I think you got a lot on your mind. Let me have the chicken. Here you go. That's a good one. Amil. Put that rump roast there. Keep it there, still. Asshole. Holding an ass. I was kidding about the the eye exam thing. Owwww! Oh God! Ahhh! Oh my... Maybe I do need an eye exam. Next thing Dino is going to have in his mouth is your head. Amil. Look at me! Rory, follow me. Jesus fucking Christ. Can't you keep your fucking mouth shut? I'll shoot you myself. Jars pop's into The Spread Eagle to chat with a girl. He also meets Deuce Secondos fucking Sal there to get his shit. Secondo? Really? You know when I was earning my stripes there Jars was undercover. He bagged them. He bagged a lot of big guys. So you should thank him. Thank him?! For making you number one. Thank him huh? Yeah, when he's in a hole. That's when I'll thank him. When he gives me my merchandise, my shit, then I'll thank him. Then I'll put him in a hole myself. That's damn good thinking A.D. That's why your numero uno. I appreciate that. Here's what your going to do. You going to follow them both. And when you see that they have my merchandise, you get it. Okay? Then... I want you to kill them both. No no no. I... promise you. I promise you, okay? You'll get the money. And soon. We're growing impatient. Just... just listen to me for a second okay? Please. Please. Just relax. Next time we do not call. Who is your dog by the way? What is his name? Dino? My dog? Yeah. Yeah. His name is Dino. What do you get about 4 miles a gallon in this thing? Yeah, if I am driving downhill and with the wind. You pay 300 bucks a month to park a thousand car. I just keep it to drive to Yonkers and back really. You know, there's a chance we may find something unpleasant up there in Yonkers. Shit. I was wondering if you were going to mention something like that. I don't need to see a body. Not yet. Not now. I don't either. Not too obvious. You get a look at him? A look at who? The guy in the Lincoln. Don't stare. No need to get him riled up. So surprised that your here. They'd expect to see you eventually. But I don't think they expected me. I don't think he'll bother us. He just wants to make sure that we don't walk out of here with a hundred pounds of heroin. Yeah? I'd say they were here. Wow. What a mess. Did he have anything else of value? As a matter of fact he did. I am looking for them right now and I don't see them. He had a lot of first edition books. All classics. I mean they were his pride and joy. Which books? Madame Bovary Tom Jones Dangerous Liaisons Lolita. I know those books. Hot stuff. I even bought him a first edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray. Oscar Wilde. The books that are left here are not the pricey first editions. There used to be trunk here. A big one. You can actually see where the dust marks were. Maybe it's time to crack open this journal. All right. We are still in a technological adolescence. Maybe fifty years with most significant break throughs occurring in the last twenty. That is a nanosecond in space time. It is logical to reason, that alien life is far more advanced then we are. So did we stumble upon a life form similar to our own? We're likely made of the same basic elements. The ratio,the size,the distance of the planet with stars. Strikingly similar to our own. I would say yeah. Okay. So these light pulses what exactly do they contain? We intercepted these pulses and believe they contain information. A lot! It seems they have the ability to harness light with out the need for any type of fiber optics! It is quite... remarkable! Panic Miser. Could that be Dente? Possibly but what's circular bins? None of this makes any sense. Panic Miser's on the top left corner, like it's addressed to someone. Could be you! Who else would he trust with this? He never called me anything close to Panic Miser. When I was a little girl he used to call me princess. We're grasping at straws! (Spanish) What? It's just spanish for "Damn". What's the spanish word for princess? "Princesa". It's an anagram! Mi princesa? "Y" "C" "N"... "Y" "C" "N"... "C" "N"... NYC! New York City! And the rest rearrange to form public library. New York City Public Library! But there are some letters left over. "A" "S" "S"... Bingo! "S" "A" "S". As in the Sumner A Schmidt Building! Okay, he must want me to go to the library. Go to that branch! Yea. Let's go. Nice and easy. Mason Jars. I heard you were dead. I get that a lot. Your with Alphonse Dente I assume? You assume right. We taking this to my car. It's roomier. Agitate the gravel Honey. Don't call me Honey. Get your ass out of here! Jesus, if you let us go we will have it. You two ain't leaving my side until I get that shit in my trunk! Well with a gun in our face, we won't look real well. Well you better get used to it real fast Honey! Don't call me that! Well okay. If that's how it has to be... I guess I'll have to look in the journal and see where we're going. Real easy. I gotta take this. No sudden moves... Honey. Is this Alphonse Dente? Yeah, who the fuck is this? I heard you been busy. Oh, it's been awhile Jars. I heard you were dead. Where's Rory? You mean this big lunk head? He's taking a nap. You know Jars, just give me what's mine. Give us a day and you'll have it. But I want your guarantee. When you get your merchandise, Donna and I will be left alone. All debts paid in full. You have my word. You'll be hearing from us soon. What did he say? As soon as he gets his drugs, he's gonna kill us both. If I had to draw a picture of a woman working in a library, that'd be it. Come back when your hair is blue. Excuse me Ma'am? My friend and I are looking for a book. We're on a scavenger hunt of sorts. The only clues that we have are some letters that we think is an anagram and some boxed numbers. This does look familiar to me. The decimal point. But number 64 doesn't quite fit. Fit what? The Dewey Decimal System. Now why are they in squares? Squares. Box of squares. What the hell are you talking about? 822.8 Does that catalog as anything? When she said squares, I realized what it meant. Oh these darn contraptions. I just gave her the square routes. Daddy had some tricks up his sleeve didn't he? You would have gotten this far eventually on your own... Honey. Could it be The Importance of Being Earnest? By... Oscar Wilde! Cowards lie is Oscar Wilde! There you go! Come on! Thank you! Oh! Wow! He liked Oscar Wilde huh? My father did. I gave him this book! This exact book! I recognize the grey cover. The peeling here. I gave him this at the same time as The Picture of Dorian Gray except this one wasn't a first edition. How would the library have the actual book you gave your father? I don't know. But he led us right to it. Didn't he? There is nothing in here. There is. There's a lot in this book. This book is about a guy who leads a double life. He steels. He lies. But he comes full circle in the end. Yeah? Okay, but what's your point? Well your father made some bad choices. He worked for Dente. Maybe something went down that he didn't like or agree with. And he decided to take matters into his own hands. He's using this as a metaphor for redemption. Redemption after death. Earnest loved a woman in this book. In your fathers case, the woman, is you. Yeah. All of that makes sense. But... What about the stolen drugs? What about the other books that are missing? Excuse me? What do you with books that are donated? Rare, expensive books? They're inspected, and categorized. And most of them eventually make there way back to the shelves. Can you look in your computer and see if a Mr. Richard Valenzuela made a donation in the last few days? I can tell you that my computer won't show anything. Because... I processed that donation myself! What a beautiful collection of first editions! It will take weeks to go through them though! Where are they in the meantime? Can we see them? I am afraid not. They are in the basement. No, it's like a vault down there. Now I am so sorry but will that be all? No. When can we see the books. Oh, it'll take a few weeks to go through them all. Thank you for your time. Oh. Oh, one more thing. If you do talk to Mister Valenzuela please assure him that I will return the gorgeous antique chest that he brought the books in. Oh, it's so beautiful, but it's so heavy. How heavy? (Mumbling) Yeah Boss? Save the shit for later. I have another assignment for you. Okay. And this time moron, do not, do not fuck it up. Okay. You old fuck! Holy shit! You got to be shitting me! So he donated the books to the library. And put the drugs in a false bottom of the chest. Damn good hiding spot. Why don't we just tell him where the chest is and let him figure it out? You think that's what your dad had in mind? Okay. So now what? Do we get it ourselves? I mean the librarian said it's a vault down there. Well, to an elderly woman from Scarsdale, a locked room and a 65 year old unarmed security guard might seem like a vault. Okay. We're alive as long as Dente doesn't have his drugs. But we're dead if he doesn't get him. Oh God. I wish we could just get the drugs, sell them, and just go! You might be onto something. I have an idea. But I may have to call your least favorite person. ("Good night my friends!") Take a shot of this. Why? Your gonna need it. Why is that? Your going to give me the number and address to Deuce Secondo's private club. That's a lot more than a favor ("my friend.") It's important. It better be. 'Cause he'll cut your nuts off if you waste his time. And maybe he'll cut mine off... Just for fun. Last time. We have everything we need for tomorrow? Schematic, two duffle bags that fold up nicely. And should fit under your shirt. Why two duffle bags? Two 50 pound bags should be easier to handle than one 100 pound bag don't you think? I got to hit it. Why are you doing that? Everyone thinks I'm still using. Let the Deuce keep thinking that. On the outside it doesn't seem like a real rational decision screwing Dente out of his own merchandise. I beginning to wonder how rational this decision is myself. Deuce has a long history with Dente. He is going to go for this deal. We take the money, and we blow out of town. Go back to your apartment and wait for me, okay? He's clean. You don't look so good Jars. Shit, you look like a million freaking bucks! I hope I look a lot better then that! Hey, this better be good. I guess you heard about how Dente missing stash by now? It rings a bell. Well I'll have it my hands by tomorrow night. Now you got my attention. And where would it be now if I may be so bold as to ask. Only I know where it is. And it's going to stay that way 'til tomorrow night. 8 million uncut. That's 20 million on the street. Yours for 2 million. And your on the run, for the rest of your miserable life. I'll be on fucking Pluto. I'll be out of here for good. You know it's funny how things change. Huh Jars? Not long ago you were King Kong Badass huh? You were the ruler of the planet. Now look at you now! You're a strung out fucking junkie ripping off the guys you used to put away. This deal may break Dente. Who knows how much of this stash is financed. He may have to blow town too. You'll be number one man on the east coast. Do we have a deal? You know Jars back in the day, you were looked upon as a kind of straight shooter. I hope your current dilapidated fucking condition hasn't changed that. Deal. 4 o'clock tomorrow. 5th and 42nd. 5th and 42nd? The New York City Public Library. The New York City Public Library? It's public. Lots of people. I know I'll get out of there. All right. Now get out of here. Come on. This better be good. Boss, I hope your sitting down for this. What now? Jars just left this private club with the Deuce. That snake in the grass. The Deuce. Did Jars have the stash on him? No. The whole meeting lasted about five minutes. This is has gone on long enough. You keep following Jars. He just split with the girl. He's in the alley on foot by himself. She'll be back in her apartment. Try to get there ahead of Jars and surprise the girl. I'll call Vin and have him pick me up. And Amil... Yeah Boss. Surprise me for once. Don't do anything stupid. Yeah, I won't Boss. Fucking asshole. Hey put your fucking hands up! Get them up cock sucker! There something you want? Yeah there's something I want. You know what the fuck I want. I want my 8 million dollars worth of heroin you cocksucker. Give it to me and no one gets hurt. No one gets hurt. Safety is the name of the game. Yeah. Your safety is up to me cock sucker. Funny you should say that. Ohhhh! Ohhhh my... Ohhhh god. You cock sucker! Wait till Dente gets a hold of your fucking girlfriend. You mother fucker! You cock... You fucking scum bag! "And topping the news today, two murders and a robbery in less than 24 hours. There was panic in Central City today after a gun battle erupted..." The late great Mason Jars! That's an exaggeration isn't it? Just a prediction. You were trying to cut me out of my own merchandise. The journal was meant for me. Yeah Mason helped but he's still hooked on that shit! He's not good for anything anymore! Yeah, he was good enough to get the journal. Good enough to get my stuff. Good enough to make a deal with that sicilian barbarian! You killed my father you son of a bitch! Don't point that gun at me Honey. Don't call me that! Be very careful with that. I'll shoot your boyfriend. Woah! Everyone calm down. "In a land mark discovery, scientists have now began to decipher the light pulses coming from the new planet. It appears to be the summation of this planets entire culture, history, and knowledge. The inhabitants of the planet seem to have anticipated a cataclysmic event that would end their world. The light pulses are described as a manifest of their success as a species. No wars or violence have been uncovered in the records. Given this the decision to send this message to earth is a truly beautiful and unselfish act. More to come". Fuck. Oh shit! Fuck! I told you! Get rid of the gun. Drop then fucking gun! Get rid of it! Put your hands behind your head. Or I kill her. Well what's it going to be Jars? The stash or the girls life? The drugs are hidden in a secure area. In the basement of the library. Damn library again huh? Okay. Vinnie. Vinnie! Excuse me. Were you in a movie? Uh, excuse me? It's just... oh god you look so familiar. You know I have to take a picture of you, because my friends are totally going to go... Oh! Oh! Let me help you with that. Got a nice ass. You fucking her? My friends are just going to kill me when they see this picture. Thank you! Huh? You're a pretty fancy performer kid. Donna and I will go through that doorway and make our way to the basement. Shouldn't take more than ten minutes. No. No. No junkie. You're going alone Jars. She's staying here with me. Wait that wasn't the deal. This is my deal. You are staying here with me. You are my collateral. And let us hope that you don't end up as collateral damage. The junkie goes alone. Then we have a deal right? You walk out. Donna and I leave five minutes later. It's over. Is that right? Get out of here Jars. Another perfect Manhattan Mr. Secondo? Enough with the fucking Manhattans all right? You know? I've been doing some thinking, some planning here. Glad to hear you say that boss. This whole thing can get pretty messy. Jars double crossing Dente. All the drugs, all the cash All the heat you all ready have. What the fuck are you talking about, huh? I'am talking about when that scumbag Dente winds up in the hills in Naples milking goats. And I am the number one man on the east coast! I going to need myself a nice little private jet. You know what I mean? Hey, can I get a fucking drink over here before the next eclipse? Jesus Christ! So I'm wondering what kind of jet should I get huh? The G4? Or do you think I should go crazy and get the G5? The G5! Get your license, you can fly it yourself! Huh? Now your talking Anthony! Come on lets go. I am fucking getting antsy here. I am going punchy. Come on. Hope your library card ain't expired! Jars at 4 o'clock. I'll get there early. Here. Keep the change. I wouldn't drink that with your mouth. I hope your boy doesn't get lost down there sweet heart. Well, it's really a two person job. There is a lot to carry. Especially for somebody in his condition. Aww. His condition. That's sad. You know I think i would worry more about your condition. Especially if he's not back here in 2 minutes. He'll be here. Aside from being a pain in the ass. Your father was a very decent employee. Must have loved your mom a lot. 'Cause he always... Looked at her eyes. Very sweet, sweet. You got her eyes. You know no matter what happens after this. I want you to understand something. Dealing these drugs? That's what gets you off. You're the fucking junkie here. And if there ever comes a time when you lose you power... You'll be dead as Amil. That's what you think. These drug deals are what gets me off. It better be real. The other bags propped behind the door. It will only take a second. It's good. Why am I so surprised? Go ahead boy. Go ahead. Get more. I'll take that Jars. Hey! That's my shit! Secondo. Second! Sicilian moron! You know something Segundo? You're always... you're always going to be second rate. I am going to put a price tag on your head! Yeah, you won't be able to take a piss without looking over your shoulder! And ain't forgot about that goddamn bitch of yours either! Keep you voice down. It's library. You son of a bitch! You ugly dumb prick! Woah! I am really impressed. You all recognize me. Huh? Huh? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Let me tell you something. I am going to have brunch at the Russian Tea room. Nicely done detective! Too bad it took you so long. Wait, this whole time? This whole damn time?! Sorry I couldn't tell you. Couldn't risk it. He got hooked on that shit. I told you to be careful my friend. Mason Jars. Another case closed. Air tight. Unlimited texting? You guys went all out huh? Yeah, we'll send you a bill. Are you okay? Yeah. So... The way you found the journal and the clues all of that was bullshit? All real. We knew Dente had made a huge buy. But we had to get him in the same room as the drugs. Red handed. I did have to improvise a little though. I would think so! You took down the number one and number two guys in the city, maybe the world at once! In a library! But they all answer to somebody. So your saying that the number one is still out there? The boss of it all? That's... Impossible. It all leads to somebody or something. The crime, the money, the influence! Do you think he really exists? I do. Good to see you again! Heard you been busy. Good to see you too ("my friend.") Things have been a bit... Hectic lately. Hello Donna. Hi. So how's the dog? Dino? Oh, he's just fine. Quite friendly actually. Once again my friend, I find myself in a position of gratitude. Putting away Dente and Deuce. Oh my! That will make my New York constituents very happy. Truly above and beyond. So to speak. That we are. I am expanding horizons. We may see a world of peace very soon. We will all profit. Wouldn't I be out of a job? Yeah. You would be. But... We are not there quite yet. Your next assignment. I trust our previous arrangements will suffice this time also? Could this next assignment get me killed? I though you were too dead to kill? Who told you that?
