[HESITANTLY] Harish. [DISMISSIVE] That loser! He is absolutely useless. Just switch off the TV. [COM...] ...has shown a lot of potential here and there. Ummm... let's see how he plays today. Why waste our time? He is good for nothing. He is usually useless. But... [COMMENTARY CONTINUES] I think Tamilnadu is in a very good position Yeah, absolutely. This season different players have stepped up for them. And they look like they're putting in a good all round performance this year. And... Harish is off the mark immediately. Pavithraaaaa.

Rathi, coding. -Jessica's boyfriend, research. -Jessica's boyfriend, research. Guys uh... My boyfriend will finish the research soon. Okay! The poor lad does so much more than just research. He pays for your food... Acts as your personal chauffeur. Cleans your motorcycle too. The only thing he hasn't done yet is clean your bathroom. He loves me, he loves doing all this for me. Will your boyfriend do any of these things for you? Why should he? I have a pair of hands, legs, and most importantly, a brain. I'm independent. At least my boyfriend is not a sex addict like yours. Look at you. Carrying a condom in your bag all the time. Jealous that you haven't done it yet? Why should I be jealous? We're saving ourselves. Whoa! I don't expect you to get it. Pavithra does. She hasn't done it either. Why are you dragging me into this? It's a disgrace to do these things before getting married. My actions don't hurt anyone. I'm not cheating anyone either. I'm doing what I like. Does that make me a bad person? Nice. Try reasoning this out with your parents and relatives. Society will shun you. Okay, madam. In that case, I'll gather everybody and perform religious rituals... before doing it with my boyfriend. Sounds good? What? I-- I don't know. I don't care. Enjoy. It tastes amazing. You want some. [DOORBELL RINGS] Hello! Is your Mom home? No, Aunty. That's okay. Come and sit with me. Sing something for me. What for? I'll tell you why. We've introduced a new product. We haven't revealed it yet. It hasn't even hit the market yet. I got it just for you. It's a Voice Enhancer spray! I don't want it, aunty. I use it every morning and night. Hear how amazing my voice sounds. Let me show you. [SINGS AN ITEM NUMBER] You sound great. This has green tea in it. It will soothe your voice Use it for two days and see the difference for yourself. You'll start singing as great as your grandma.

Those are cookies. Here you go. Your favorite chocolate. How are you? -I'm great. -How about your kids? All good, Kiddo. Happy shopping. Hi... I bought some fruits from the store. Would you like a banana? Okay. Sure? Bye, bye. That was a great knock today. Harish, come on. You played really well. Okay? Just wait till I get my hands on that Chinaman bowler. Did your dad watch the game? Yes. And? He did... but he didn't care for your batting. Didn't I play well? He watched only until Ajay's batting. To hell with your dad's obsession with Ajay. Please come here. Please come closer. -What? -Come closer. A little bit more. He will never get this. Did you try Naidu aunty's Voice Enhancer Spray? It's amazing. What's gotten into you? What's up with you, Mom? Why would you fall for this? Be skeptical. I'll ask Raghini to try it. I'm going with my Mom to the concert tomorrow. It'll get done by 8. -Pick us up, okay? -Okay. Can I tag along too? I don't think so. Get better at the basics first. Then you can join us in the big leagues. Pavithra is great. She sings just like her grandma. Let's hear that from her grandma. [PHONE CHIMES] [WAKES UP STARTLED] [EXHALES] [GRUNTS] [PHONE CHIMES] [SINGING CARNATIC MUSIC] Raghini, you're making me lose my shit everyday. Please do come for my funeral when you finally kill me. Try again! Is Ajay playing today? [CRICKET COMMENTARY]...but Tamilnadu is still in a good position Useless Harish is playing now. [COMMENTARY CONTINUES]But yeah, talking about yesterday's innings I think, Harish was having some trouble facing the Chinaman. Yeah, he seemed to have some trouble picking him out of his hand. He was trying to pick him off the pitch. But he still managed. But let's see what he's got in store for us.

Hello. This is Charukesi speaking. You're messing up like Raghini. Isn't it at 7? She is sucking the life out of me as is. Pavithra, let's eat. Do you like the pumpkin drink? Mom made it. What's wrong with you? Are you possessed? What did you do before bed last night? What? I drank milk. Ugh! What are you gonna do about it now? I really don't know. Come on, Pavithra! What's stopping you? You'll only ruin your life if you listen to Rathi. Oh, just fuck off, Jessica. You think everyone is as shameless as you? -This is not about-- -Guys, please... I'm really confused. I don't know what to do. Fine. Handle it yourself. I will. Yeah. I will. So, she can handle it herself. That's what I'm saying too. You don't have to butt in. Then you stop butting in too. Jessica, look-- Will you stop interfering in her life? -She's her own person. She knows how to. -Stop manipulating her. Look who's talking about manipulation. What are you doing then? Don't manipulate her into doing things that you want. She is only doing what she wants to do. Stop talking for a bit. -I'll stop when you do. -Can you keep your trap shut? Oh my God! Back off, Rathi. Fuck off, Jessica. Sowmya... It's going to be okay, Sowmya. Sssh, stop crying. -Ssssh! -What's happening? Sowmya, stop crying. [CRIES] My dear...

Finally, God has blessed you with good wisdom. Pavithra, No! Pavithra, Yes! Pavithra, no, no, no. Pavithra, FUCK YES! FUCK YES! [LAUGHS] -Shit! Pavithra, did you even think about your parents? Why would you even think about your parents at that time? I-I-I don't approve. Who needs your approval? Pavithra approves. Guys, guys. What do I do now? Babe, I'll teach you. Pavi, you're better than this. -Don't do this. -No, she really is not. She is just perfect the way she is. You know what? Do whatever you want. Just don't listen to Rathi. No, no, no. I'm not gonna act on it. Let's finish the project. Let's work on the project. I saw that. I'm not blind you know. Open the page. Let's do the project. -Let's do the project -Okay, project yeah.

You guys are going to hell! -Sure Rathi? -Try it out. Oh, my god! This looks ridiculous. It's sexy. I don't think I'm into this. Fine! Your wish. I guess you can just enjoy your night in a 9 yards saree. Uff... Babe! What's this? -What? -You look like a hairy caveman? Hmmm... We have a lot of work to do. I agree. What? Mmmm, sit down. Sit down. Ouch, it’s a little hot. Hold this. Hey hey, does it hurt? Not at all. Hurts like crazy. [SCREAMS] Oh my god! Why did you do that? -Don’t worry, it’s nothing. -You deserve it! Deep breath. Deep breath. Deep breath. Oh God! Deep breath. Oh, Cyril of Alexandria! [YELLS OUT IN PAIN] [SWEARS] -What? Huh? That’s Marathi, Marathi. What is she even saying? Something’s gone into my eye. Ring-a-ring-a-roses Pocket full of roses [WAILS IN PAIN] What? It hurts a lot. I’ll finish up quickly before she loses her sanity. Just kill me now. -it’s nothing, it’s nothing. -Please tell me it’s over. Breathe in, breathe in. Breathe in, breathe out. Is it done? -No, not even close. -Calm down, calm down. -Take a deep breath. -Deep breath. -Take a deep breath -Jessica, keep this there. Hey, is this how people deliver babies? Yes. Yeah, yeah. Hey, hey just a minute. Please, please. It’ll be over, it’ll be over. Couple more and you’ll be done. Let’s do the rest tomorrow? Please? -It hurts like crazy. -No need. Let’s finish it today. Then-- give me a minute please. Hey! Where are you going? Hey, Pavi! Oops! -Rathi! -Yes? How was your first time? -That funny story? -Yeah! I’ll tell you but you can’t laugh. Promise, I won’t. Okay. You remember Vasanth? -Yes. -It was with him. I see. One day I went to his hostel to return his book. Luckily, his third wheel roommate wasn’t around. Oh. What happened then? He asked me to lock the door and come inside. And… He threw all his dirty clothes off the bed... and asked me to sit. What happened next? He came close. We started kissing. It got hot and heavy very quickly. Oh damn! I stopped and asked him. If he had a condom. What did he say? Did he have one? He had a blank look on his face. Then he shook his head and said no. Oh damn. What happened then? He didn’t want to stop. He picked up a few things near him... and asked if that could be used as a condom. Did you find anything? Like what? Balloon. Aluminum foil. Plastic bag, roommate’s dirty sock. Eww. We raided the entire room and found nothing. Then we heard a voice from outside the door. Who was it? The milkman? [SARCASTICALLY] No, it was the paper boy. It was his third-wheel roommate. Oh no. Then he said... Dude, the condom is in the last draw. Since then, I always carry a condom in my bag for safety. -Ohhh! -Yeah... Does Harish know to use a condom? I don’t know. Mmmm! What do I do? Buy a condom and practice with it. Hmmm... We can go buy one. -No big deal. -Where do we buy it from? Pharmacy? Why do you want to go that far? Let’s buy it from our neighborhood grocery store. I need one too. No! -Why? -From there? No way! You don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. Are you really going to do this cheap thing? No, I won’t do it. I Promise. We were just talking. Then why do you need a condom? We were only kidding around. I won’t do anything. Okay. Fine, I’m getting late. So, I’ll leave -I’ll see you guys tomorrow. -Bye, take care. Hug? See you. -Bye -Bye -Bye guys! -Bye. Bye, bye. I’ll handle it. Rathi, I don’t think I can do this. I’ll handle it. Don’t be a chicken. But Rathi please, I don’t know if I can... -Just come -No… But please... Pavithra. -Hi. -Hey, kiddo. Hi. Here’s your favorite chocolate. Did she ask you for a chocolate? I’ve been giving this kid the same chocolate for 15 years now. This is her favorite. -Did you just say ‘kid’? -Yeah, she’s still a kid. What do you want? I don’t want anything. But the ‘kid’ wants something. -Ask him. -What do you want? [PICKS UP SANITARY NAPKIN] Should I wrap it in paper? Why paper? Is it going to be wrapped and gifted to someone? Eh? Don’t decide what she wants. Let her talk. What else is the kid going to ask for? Give us a box of condoms, uncle. Huh? What flavor do you want? Green apple, Spearmint, Black Grape? Ahh... Will they have Pumpkin Spice? Pumpkin? You’re not celebrating Halloween. Uncle, can you give us the green apple flavor? It’s only for married couples, kid. -Huh? -What? Leave it. [EXHALES HEAVILY] Then, will you get her married yourself? She’s still a kid. What’s the hurry? Oh, we’ll get married and come back in 5 years. Okay. Sounds good. See you kids. Do you think we belong to the generation... who knock up their wives when they're bored? How many kids do you have? 10 or 15? Govind, Murugesh, Lo... Why do you need this information? What do you want? I already told you. Condom! Eh... Hmmm? Should I wrap it in paper? Come, Pavithra. -Thank you, Uncle. -[Nods head] Okay. Sorry. Yay, we got it! Shame on you, Pavithra. What? I’ll get you a sexy lingerie and come home. -Take this. -Hey... [CLICKS TONGUE] Hi, aunty. Mom and dad aren’t home. Nor do I have anything in my hand. I went to the store... but didn’t buy anything. Do you want me to show you my hand? You seem busy, I’ll show you later. Bye, aunty. [EXHALES IN RELIEF] Hmmm. Oh... oh... Oh! Puppy... Hi...Hi... Who needs to go out? Go, go, go. Go away! Bye, puppy. Hmmm. [SNIFFS THE CONDOM] Mmmm. [DOG BARKS] Damn! Oh god no... Oh, God... Give it! Give it to me. [PHONE RINGS] [WAILING OVER THE PHONE] Mom, what happened? Are you okay? I can't take Mom to the concert tonight. You have to take her. Mom, I can't go today. I've already informed mom. Just go see her. But Mom... Ey! Eee! No! No... Come on. Come. Aren't you ready yet? What for, Grandma? Didn't Mom tell you? She just asked me to come and see you. You have to accompany me today. At the concert, you will be singing instead of your Mom. Sing? Me? But Grandma... Go get dressed. It's getting late. [HUMS] Hey, Leprechaun! Look at me, you Minion. You think you're so innocent but you're such a sinner. I saw you buying condoms. What are you looking at? Let me tell you one thing. Girls who deceive guys like us... will never find happiness. I'm cursing you. You're going to remain a virgin all your life.
