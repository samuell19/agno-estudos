Christ asks us to be perfect. Oh well. Really? Christ is not embarrassed. Asking us no matter what. Here, drink: this is my blood. Where's toilet please? Oh but... I don't work here. Oh well... You might know where it is anyway. Upstairs on the left. There you go. You're welcome. Shall we go? But I've barely seen anything, I haven't even said hi to Ben. No it's OK I told him you were here. But it's not exactly the same thing. He knows you came for the exhibition, That's all that matters right? Not if don't look at what he did. You don't want him to see him cause he likes me and you don't like that. "I don't like that", what's that? It doesn't mean anything. I'll go pee and then we'll leave. No! Don't go pee now. You want me to stay with you? Yes. Oh shit! Fuck, Pomme! Why did you buy it? You didn't have to! We don't have enough money! - Consider it you birthday gift. - "Consider"? - Happy birthday! - It's in 8 months! - Well now it's taken care of. - OK, thanks. What's up now? Nothing. Thanks. What do you want me to say? Unbelievable. Thank You. Why did you do that? Do what? I stopped the bus, didn't I? I thought you were right behind me. You saw that I wasn't there. No, yes... I didn't pay attention. So pay attention in the future. I'm scared now! Stop that. What have we become? Your parents. Come on... Your scar was showing. IF YOU DON'T, I WILL Sugar? Yes. For a change. Did you sleep in the office? No. In our bed. You didn't feel it? No. No, I didn't feel anything. Mom? I bought some grocery for you. Do you keep plastic bags? What for? Small trash bags for example. So you throw them away easily. You don't have to do that. Did you remember to get quinoa? And kamut as well. What? Kamut: spelt, durum and quinoa mixed together. Congratulations. It's all clean here. That's Dalia. Who's Dalia? That's the maid. She's Bulgarian. Thanks for the wine. You have a maid? I teach her French in exchange. It's easy: she speaks well already. Want some? It's not even 6 PM, Ro. Have a drink. You bought wine. I thought it's Saturday and You might have friends over. I prefer you don't drink bad stuff. Wouldn't you prefer that I don't drink at all? Yes. But you bring me wine. Stop. You sound like Pierre. To Simone. Today it's her birthday. Thanks for the bottles. Perfect timing. So her name is Simone. You can come for lunch tomorrow. I'll cook lamb shoulder. We'll go visit her parents already. They come first. No, we've been there several Sundays. Take care, Mom. Take care, honey. You already? [English accent] I'm advanced. That no bother you? That no bother me, no. Come in. You... You eat carbohydrates. Yeah, well... Gratin dauphinois. Last night. After 6 PM? Well yes, after 6 PM. It wasn't a snack. Don't joke. You're crying? What's wrong? Oh I'm sorry! John is here. Are you coming? I juiced my hand earlier. There was no orange and I just kept on juicing. I juiced my hand. There was no orange. Never mind. Are you coming? How do we tell him we can't pay him this month? We don't. We tell him nothing. We'll have to pay him somehow. Can't you see I'm on the phone? You took a beach towel. It was kept with the normal towels. Yeah... You don't love me anymore, do you? What does it have to do with that? That's it. Wrong answer. Because you put a beach towel among the bath towels, that means I don't love you anymore? You're making it worse. What's the right answer? "Yes"? Definitely not. Like "I love you"? Kinda. OK. I love you. OK. Me too. Champagne then. Sure. We got none left. I would have been surprised if we did. No I swear I thought we had some. But I drank it with Mellie the other day. - Miss Weather girl? - Stop that she's a journalist. Local weather for the moment. I didn't know that you still see her. She came over Tuesday afternoon. She was in the area. Her son is in a private school, nearby. He's got psychomotor problems. Oh shit that's dumb. You're dumb. You drink champagne with miss Weather girl in the afternoon? We hadn't seen each other in a long while. We hadn't seen each other in a long while too. I knew it. We still have this. Half bottle from the neighbor for New Year's. That's just "Cremant" [Sparkling wine]. No that's real champagne. It's "brut", honey. Freezer. Super Frost. Oh shit! Cheers. Cheers. Watch out for the glass pieces. I can see one of your breasts. Yes. I know. You called me honey earlier. And? I can still call you honey, can't I? I don't know. For real, I don't know. What? No, it's nothing. It's nothing. You always picnic in the car? He carries the bag during the hike and you eat here? Not always. Here it is! I found it. It's not the one. Not the one? What's the probability... Of hunting for a tiny lost earring, finding it and it's not the one? Greater than that of me with different earrings. This is yours. - Certainly not - Let me see. It's yours, Pomme. - I gotta thank you. - What for? I gave them to you. No... In Carcassonne, 7 or 8 years ago. You lie. We never went to Carcassonne. Of course Pomme you did! After your diploma. Even I remember it. Thank you, Sonia. You know actually it should sound like Sonja with a "j". I put an "i" there to simplify. My parents say "Son-ja". Nobody cares Sonia! What's the matter? The matter is that my ears are not fucking pierced! But I know it well, honey. It was a nasty gift to begin with. You did right losing it. You really don't remember? Pierre! Excuse me. It's acting up again. Yeah. What are you doing? Putting on my pants. On the floor? Never mind, it's that... They don't fit anymore? They do. It's actually rather casual you know? - I'm making an effort. - Why? Just like that. For me, for myself. How come? For me, I said. I prefer you wearing ripped jeans, a baggy T shirt and dirty sneakers. Really? I don't know what to say about it. I never wear ripped jeans. I don't have any, I give them away. You should keep them or go buy some at Emmaus. I'm not gonna buy stuff that i gave away. You'd be capable of doing that. It's just your style. But you just... - What are you looking for? - The emergency pack. You wanna smoke? - No not me. - Who? It's Mellie and her son, you know. His school is nearby. They came over at 3. You could have told me. Well I'm telling you. Here it is. Shit. Hi, Pomme! Tuxedo and everything! I look so crappy, when I'm not working I don't really care. No, well... It suits you well. He's Tom, my son. Tom, Pomme. Hello Tom! What happened? It was a friend. Oh wow, what a friend! Oh yeah... I'm sorry. What? Oh Nothing... I just thought that something weird must have happened. Why? Never mind. Pomme, honestly... So what do you foresee for the weekend? Well he has school. It's a shame, cause some friends invited us to their sort of farmhouse. Near Chateaudun. That sucks cause they have ponies, horses... I meant what do you foresee about the weather. 18, 19 Â°C. The seasonal average. Slightly higher. In the brain there's any sort of cell. Mostly there are meninges, which surround the brain. Neurons, that you already know. And there are glial cells, but we don't really know what they're for. We know they nourish the neurons and accelerate... The connections between them. What's up with your son? He's not my son. He's Pomme's, my wife's. I don't feel well either, but I'd never sprawl like that at my host's place. - I'm gonna call him a cab. - Yeah do that. So you're Pomme. Yes, it's me. Why? I see, I see. What do you see? I just see, that's all. You almost died, didn't you. Excuse me? Sorry, sorry... But I understand. It's not easy to deal with her. - Her? - Who? Death. How do you handle it? You think about her or not? Alright... That explains the tuxedo. - Hi. - Hi. May I? What? Come! Come dance with me! Please, we never dance anymore. Among other things, yeah. That's all I ask for. Ask more clearly. You ask. I don't dare anymore. Dance, please. Dance now. Move! I beg you, move. Move! We never dance. We grow old. Except your friends from St. Etienne. Nobody dance. Not just us. Yeah. We all grow old. We still like music though. You listen to it as well? Not any more. In the car. Sometimes. Could you turn it off by the way? I'm exhausted. Already? It's early. They'll be mad. It sucks. I wanted to finally introduce you to Louis. He called. He can't come actually. Ah, shit. He got held up. "I got held up," he said. Only that. Held up. That sucks. I had no clue you knew Mellie Desnoyer? I know her from capoeira. - You still go? - Of course. I don't know her well. It's... Pierre. Stop. Stop right now. Anyway I hope you didn't tell everyone I almost died. It was nothing. I could have lived 150 years. Tell who? That other asshole there. "Death". With a beard and a turtleneck. Jean-Jacques. He can be annoying. To each his own. He likes death. OK. The music! It's not me, it's not me... Don't tell me you're trying to light a fire. You always put me down. You denigrate me. We don't even have a lighter. I'm gonna find some flint. You see? I can't believe it. You're looking for flint now! Yeah, or something that serves the purpose. What can serve the purpose of flint? Flint is flint. Rocks have no smell. It kinda smells like sulphur. Sulphur? Forget about it. - We have no tinder. - What? Tinder. Are you thinking about her? Her, Death! What a douchebag. Her, Mellie. I got nothing to do with Mellie. Have you ever been hiking with her? I said I got nothing to do with her. Why would I take here on a hike? And when, anyway? When I do my internship, in Plessis. On top of that she got flat feet. She can't walk for too long. Oh you know that. You see? Are you stupid or what? I said it on purpose. How could I know if someone, especially a girl has flat feet? And how could flat feet come up in a conversation? It can. It just happened. And when I met you, I told you all my flaws. Not all of them. Not really. Excluding those that I developed being near you. Bastard. She got no flat feet but she got pierced ears indeed! Who? Death? It's the other way. Pomme! Pomme! Pomme! So you're back? Hello Cecile, hello Angele. You've lost weight. No... Did you lose weight? No. It must be me. I'm clueless. You're back? You're all skinny. Did you lose weight? No, I'm as usual. You did something. Your hair color? Well no... You look like someone else. Really? Yes, sorry I'm here. Yes. You got a scar? Yes. Yes, yes! We'll do like that. That's right. Very well. I tidied up well. Mr. Marouani wants to see you. I'm the new intern. But I'm not working right now. What a pain in the ass, he knows well! You're Pomme, right? Yeah I only came to pick up some stuff. What a bitch he is. I'm wearing a tracksuit! It's OK. If he makes a comment, you tell me and I'll take care of that. Oh really? Yeah he's my father. Ah... I'm sorry... It's OK, it happens quite often. It's not an appropriate attire. But I was in the neighborhood, I just wanted to come pick up... It's fine. I heard you came back. I'm not exactly back. I just came to pick up... We can't make it without you. I know you're on leave until August. But... You got an insect on your face. Oh yeah, it's an ant. An ant? You got one on your neck too. Are you doing better actually? Oh yeah. Much better. And... Malignant? No no, fortunately. A benign tumor. So you're doing well. Yeah but I only came to pick up... Pick up what? My spare keys. Are you hosting an illegal immigrant? Are you hosting an illegal immigrant? You know that here we can't afford to break the law in any way. An illegal immigrant? Not at all. Alright. You know we're in receivership. Yes. And you don't wanna come back sooner if I got it right. I'm sorry. I'm gonna work full throttle when I'll be back. If we're not bankrupt. Yes: If we're not bankrupt. That's all you reaction? I like you, Pomme. I like you. OK, you can go. Thanks, Mom. I'm sorry. I knew I had them. You had all your stuff? I slept at Simone's. I only realized once I got back home. You should give a spare key to your housekeeper. Housekeeper? I don't have one. You should quit sports, Mom. It's for old people. You're in good shape. Are you studying well? But are you gonna remember afterwards? After the test I mean. Cause I used to study, then I would pass the exam... And then it vanished. Into thin air, I don't know where. I'm fine. It stays. Good. Very good, honey. I'm very happy. I look at you and I think... He got all these things in his head, all these connections. It's OK mom, calm down. Can I drink your glass of water? There's an Efferalgan in it. Don't take too much Paracetamol. It's bad for your liver. Yeah well... You want me to buy you groceries, some fruits? - I got peaches from Simone's parents - They grow peaches? Mom, no they don't. They just bought them! Oh yes. Mom I don't wanna kick you out, but don't you have aquagym or something? You overprotect me, mom. Not at all. Alright I'm off. Wanna come hiking with us on Saturday? Ehm... No. - Give me that. - No, I'll make it. - Give me that please - Do you mind? We bring all this? This will go bad. This... How do we eat this exactly? Put the cream back in the fridge, not in the trash can. There you go! That wine will get boiling hot. Fuck, you could just be happy! You could appreciate if for once I bring more than breadless Camembert cheese... And salami with no knife. Yeah but you're not carrying it. I'd be happy to do it. I'm sorry, OK. It's nice, it's awesome. Are you sure we'll really go? They say there will be a storm. Bring the Windbreakers. Soursops. Nothing. That's what they're called. Go get the Windbreakers. You're the soursop. Something nice for once. What's nice about it? Maybe it's not a good idea to be just me and you. We should insist with Sonia to make her come, or... Someone else. We'll end up kill each other. To end up in prison? Thanks a lot. I'll end up killing you. Why not ask Roro? He used to love to hike, Romain. He used to keep up very well. I don't want him to witness a bloodbath. Just say he didn't want to. You asked and he said no. Did you ask him? Yes. And? And he didn't want to. Me neither as a matter of fact. What did you just say? I said me neither, I don't really feel like going anymore. I wouldn't stand you up. I got all planned this time. What's the matter? Shit, that sucks. - What? - Hush! Can't you hear? There's someone here. Did I tell you that Marouani is in receivership? And? Oh well, never mind... Come on we won't picnic here. - Hello! - Hello! - The way up is steep - It's good for the calves. - Oh yeah? - It lengthens them. It tapers them. Got any toilet paper by chance? No, we don't. Oh, but... We got this. Keep it. Goodbye. See why I don't like to run into people? Not everyone wants toilet paper. It's not my fault. I couldn't know. We won't go this way. And you talk to them. I only said "hello". Sometimes that's enough. You could see it on her face she wanted to shit. I saw that. Whatever. You're totally crazy. What are we going uphill for? You'd rather go there where she is? It's disgusting! Alright it's disgusting indeed. Then they eat there! - Calm down. - Don't get me started. - Calm down. - Don't get me started I said. Keep going. Go! Are you OK? I barely pushed. It's the backpack. I'm sorry. Are you OK? You want me to carry it? Absolutely not! Are you crazy? It's too heavy! Did I tell you that Marouani is in receivership? Yeah you said that earlier. I know. I was just kidding. We never talk about anything. Wanna talk about Marouani? Why not? He's my boss. Not him directly. It's the company. What about the company? That's in receivership. Let's rather talk about us. You wanna take the shortcut or the long way? Let's take the long way. We ain't got the time if we wanna be on time tonight. We have to shower, get dressed and all. I already don't wanna go there and I'm carrying all this. I asked you to carry it. You asked me knowing well that I would have said no. Come on... Let's go home. No. I said I'm staying. You go home. I'm staying. Leave here the bag, your Windbreaker and your sweater. What for? Come on. I'm sorry. No. I said I'm sorry. You wanna carry the backpack? - I'm sorry. - No. I'm fucking sorry. How will you get home? This is absurd. OK, sorry for everything, not just for the backpack. I don't like to dance. I don't like to dance. You wanna dance? Let's dance. Give me the bag, right now! Whatever. Why you need 2 Windbreakers? You're not gonna hitchhike, right? No. I'm totally gonna lose weight. And much more. Don't get lost. I don't think it'll take her much longer. Ouch! Miss? Hello, miss. You're an early riser! Are you alone? I... I came early. I've... Don't be afraid. I'm the forest ranger. I pick up all the filth... Left by all those dirty pigs. I didn't see cars in the lot. Where's yours? My husband's gonna come look for me. I... I've... I lost my keys here yesterday. So he dropped me off. Because he had an appointment. With his DHR. But he won't be long. I'm gonna help you looking. Oh that's nice but... Thanks, I'll manage. It'll be faster. Was it here? In this area? Within which distance? I'd say 2 or 3 meters. Was it actually a keychain? Uhm... Yes. A small one. I say we won't find it. Here they are! It's a pull tab. I think we will never find them. It's not a big deal. My son has a spare. I'm off. Thank you. I'll keep on looking. If I find them, I'll take them down to the parking lot. OK. And I'll put them in the gutter of little hut. OK. You'll come back later. If your husband's already here. OK. But... The parking lot is that way. Oh yes. So you're not here? My husband. - Is that squeezed orange juice? - Yes. Because I don't see any pulp. The machine filters it. Alright. And you got any salted butter? Just kidding. It's all good. All alone? - Pomme isn't here? - No... Actually yes: she's at the restrooms. Are you OK? Yes. You look worried. Excuse me. Wait. You leave your son outside? You don't even carry his huge backpack? You could at least get him some kind of trolley. He's gonna get scoliosis on top of it. On top of what? His problems. Tell him to join us. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... It's OK he feels no physical pain. What's that all about? Makes no sense. Nobody feels no physical pain. What about yogis? Yogis? Who do you think you are? You couldn't even make one kid, even one who has problems. And you think you know what a fakir feels or doesn't feel? He's a fakir now? How are you honey? My phone's almost dead. Calling Romain... Hello? Yes, Romain. Your name showed up. Are you OK? Listen... It's OK, it's OK... And you? No, No... I can't hear you well. We're at the Champion Supermarket. Well, former Champion, it's called Carrefour now. Well now we're not in the same aisle... There's no signal near the freezers. No, just ice cream. And tiny sausages and tiny blood sausages you know? Sonia and her new boyfriend are coming over tomorrow. Well if he shows up. No, not really... Hello? Hello... Hello! Hello... You let your beard grow? It's nice. I just forgot to shave. That's it. We're OK, yeah. No problem. How many more? 127. What? 127? I can't do it. Is it Pomme? No, it's not Pomme. [Fake English accent] And we no OK at all. Pomme gone. Gone? We hike and Pomme gone. Stay in forest. She lived in forest. She didn't live in the forest, John. She lives there right now. She eats earthworms and dead leaves. Lots of exercise, Pomme. Lots of losing weight. No need of John and no need of Pierre. Away from me. Have a seat. There, on the tip of the bed. You think so? So what's going on? Mom's having a relapse, right? A relapse of what? Of that brain tumor. You can tell me. Oh no. It was benign. So there's no possible relapse. Didn't we tell you? Really? It was benign? Of course. What did you think? We were lying? Just to reassure me. Your mother is doing well. She's fine. Are you breaking up? No, but she did leave. It was building up. Not necessarily. Not exactly. Did it? She didn't tell you anything? She didn't call you? - She certainly ran out of battery - She doesn't have her charger? Where is she? With Sonia? Did you know it's actually Sonja with a "j"? Your mother's in the Chamoiselle forest. We went hiking last Saturday, And it looks like she stayed there. You had a fight and she didn't come home with you? That's it? She hitchhiked or took a train. She must be with someone now. With Sonia, who won't tell you, or in Nimes with Grandma. No, I know her. She's there somewhere. Trust me. I wanted you to know and not to worry about it. You know her? You know her. That's all you have to say. You know her so well you think she could consider living in the forest. Go get her! What are you doing here? Call the cops! You say you know her? I know her too. Mom's been in the forest for a week? This is bad Pierre. Well I don't really know... - I'm not sure. - Not sure. Not necessarily. Not exactly. What do you want? And what about her? What the fuck does she want? Come here. Come. Commit suicide. Rip your own skin off. Cook yourself. Your wife will be saved. It won't last between you. 444 kilometers of paths. 45.000 hectares! Alright. Big mammals including wild boars, and deers. Wild boars! Birds... Among the most interesting species, there's the European bee-eater, middle-spotted woodpeckers, black woodpeckers, Dartford warblers... Wood warblers. Western Bonelli's warblers, really not the same. - Hello! Hello! - Hello! Hello! Hello!... Hello! Does it bother you if I don't talk? If I say nothing? No, no. I'm the silent type. Very, very silent. A sphinx. My wife always expects me to talk. I mean... She used to. What's your name? Gena. Gena Rowlands. Isn't that an actress? Indeed. What a sick girl. What an idiot. You take debit cards? Of course! Oh great! Vive la France. Do you know where I could get a room. And where I could pay with debit card. There's "Le Commerce", but with the festival... The festival? Didn't you notice all those cars? We got our chamber music festival. Here? Yes, at the abbey. Alright. What if we all introduced ourselves? Marc, violin. Jacques, his brother. Alto. Segolene, violin. Piano, Cecile... In a trio. With Blandine and Bouba. Cello. Bouba, violin. Cecile too. Clarinet. Sometimes oboe, to help out. Maxim, or Max, Cello. And my wife, Clarinet. Noemi. I'm sorry. Noemi, clarinet. Marie-Christine, piano. Violin. Piano. Violin. Piano. Violin. Piano. Pomme. Franck, alto. What are you working on right now? I'd rather surprise you. Come on. What century? 19th. Oh Really? Pomme! Pomme! Fuck! Pomme! I gotta tidy up. Are you OK? Are you hurt? Are you OK? Easy. Come on... Hello. Simone? Pomme? Are you Romain's mom? You came back? - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. Please come in. Ah, Dalia just came by. You know Dalia? No, but I... You know she exists. Yes that's it. Are you OK? Are you feeling well? Yes, I'm fine. I didn't have my keys. We only took one set and I... There's no one in, so I came over. I play alone. Romain doesn't like it. He makes fun of me. Sometimes it makes me feel bad. Do you wanna have something? You want me to make you a... Hot chocolate? A grog? We got it for free on the highway. A full tank plus 1.99 Euros. I'm trying to beat my own best score. 617 points. That's good. Well, we have to tell them. They don't know yet? My battery died. It's been a while. Romain wanted to go to the police. They would have never recognized me. Blowing it up must have cost a lot. I'm gonna have to refund him. Your husband paid. What day is it today? The 14th. No I mean what day of the week? Wednesday. Oh I'm sorry! No big deal... I memorized it all. Do you have a trash bag? What type of car is this car? It smells like new. An Audi A6. It's new indeed, but I'm just leasing. You know what that is? Yeah. I didn't know this way. It's actually shorter. It's really almost the same. Almost. Mellie? Don't stay there. Listen, Mellie, I'm sorry but... What do you want, Mellie? I mean, exactly? I'm not gonna sleep with you. I don't sleep around like that. And anyway... Pomme is here. She's taking a nap. She came home. We need some quiet. You understand? It's me. Pomme. Hush. You'll wake me up. You're beautiful. What's up? Don't overdo it. I don't. I bought it as it is. It's not custom made. Don't be silly. That's right. Don't be silly... It's nice. You mean the tap? Yes. You had the water heater fixed? Yes. Just imagine: I saved a chamois. A tiny one. 25 kilos though. And I recognized ceps... Goliath webcaps and chanterelles, but that's easy. Ceps are easy too. You know I went looking for you. It even snowed a bit. Really? You came? I think it's the least one could do... Well certainly, if you put this way... Well tell me exactly how else am do you want me to put it. I know, one is missing. No, that's it. Oh I thought... John is gonna come. We have our class. How stupid. Such a beautiful moment of intimacy. I think it is one. That's what I just said, didn't I? We agree. We agree. We have time. That doesn't work anymore. Stop with that. What doesn't work? This, the clocks. Everything, us. Nothing works. But... But what? But you didn't even cheat on me? You think that's the question? What's the question? The one about... You know what the question is. But you don't even dare to say it. Precisely. The one about love. The one about love, yes. Ah, love, yes... No, I should say: Oh, love... I don't know what you should say. I don't know anymore. There, there, just now, you were coming towards me. No, I was gonna leave. Just like that? Just like that.
