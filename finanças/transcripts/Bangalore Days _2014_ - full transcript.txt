Wasn't it 40 Rupees for one meal till yesterday? lf you keep raising the price, we'll have to take loans for this. 'This is Kuppi. He's the most enthusiastic one in the group.'

We can make this happen somehow. But that one. l don't see any chance. 'Varun is furious.

Silly baldie! lndustrial Revolution? ls he a Communist? How is lndustrial Revolution & Communism related? l.V. Dude!! Bro, trip!! The first trip in our college life. Your l.V. has been approved. The dates are from 28th to 31st of this month. Dude, 28th to 31st! So the last day is new year's eve. This will be awesome. Four days. Only South lndia. You must visit at least one industry. Who is the organizer among you guys? Varun!! 'Now the picture is clear, right?' 'Varun is tensed about the planning for the l.V trip.' Washington DC via Miami Beach. Haven't these guys had enough of this? What is this? Arunachal Pradesh. That is closeby. That's Andhra Pradesh, dude! Hey, it's time. Eat quickly. l have to feed you all the time! lsn't this mine? How did it reach here? What's wrong with Himalayas? -Are Himalayas in South lndia? lsn't it? -And do Himalayas have industries? No? Can we go to Himalayas and come back in 4 days? Can't we? Very nice! Click over there. There! Dude, Kuppi is behind you! How come you're not interested today? Usually you don't let Kuppi anywhere near you, right? For the past 3 days, she has been absent. - That's why. - Ya right! As if they are best friends! Dude, it has been 3 semesters since we joined this college. And he hasn't even spoken to her so far. l never got a good chance. That's why. Crap! l would've killed him now. lt was fine if she was a girl who shows attitude. ln spite of looking so great, she's such a sweet girl who doesn't show any attitude. Here. Take my phone. l have her number. Just call her! Message her, at least. That cheap trick of getting the number of the girl you like from somewhere and keep disturbing her? Well, l'm not gonna do any of that! Her number.. She will give it to me herself. Wait & watch! - Who is he talking about? - Your dad! Dude, Diya! Great! Didn't he find anyone better? Dude, who are the most famous couple in our college? Boban Sir & Molly Chechi! Do you know how they got together? During the first year l.V. Notjust them, most couples of our college got together first during their l.Vs. l'm saying this with the experience of being your senior.. When you're in class, you'll be stuck with attendance, seminar, lab, exam.. You won't get time for anything else. But those 4-5 days when you go on tour.. lf you're looking for a chance to talk to Diya, you won't find a better chance than the l.V. Wherever we're going, there should be enough sights to see. A fort, a palace, a museum.. lt should be colourful, right? But it would be great if there's a beach as well. Campfire, music, sunset.. Crap! lf you want all that, why don't you sit & watch Discovery channel at home? While every respectable college gives 10-15 days for l.V, our lousy college has given us only 4 days! Just 4! Dude, we should go to party spots! Raves.. But.. Palace, Rave, Beach... All of this in one place.. That's not possible! That's true. But if we go to two places, it's possible. So friends, l'm here before you to present the tour plan for the first l.V in our college life. The most beautiful visuals.. Dude, it's us! You don't want that? Okay! Well.. Even better visuals, World famous palaces, Historical forts, The first destination of our l.V. The capital of the Vijayanagara empire which we all know from our History textbooks - Hampi. - Humping? - Not humping. Hampi! Will this end up being a pilgrimage? l'm just back from Sabarimala temple. And ya, we aren't going to Hampi alone. After a tour of Hampi for 2 days, we go directly to.. lndia's party capital. MBRHDRG That's not possible! How is Goa part of South lndia? Technically speaking, there's no division between North lndia & South lndia. Even if it exists, Goa would still be part of South lndia, Sir. Which industry are you going to visit in Hampi & Goa? Sir, lnfosys, Cognizant, Excelsoft, Aabasoft, L&T... There are 50 such industries in Mysore, Sir. Mysore is on the way. Trust me, Sir! For us Computer Science students, - this is a perfect l.V. -Awesome! How will you cover all these places & come back in 4 days? We have Christmas holidays till the 27th. We will take leave for the l.V. from 28th to 31st, and 1st is a Sunday. So basically, if we take 4 days off, we would get 6 days in total. Boban Sir, 'Cute DP' H.O.D. Sir, is everything okay? Sir, we can't send them to Goa! - Don't approve it, Sir. Shall l tell them? On the last day of the l.V, 31st night, to celebrate New Year's eve, we're going to the biggest party in lndia! Sundown Party!! Varun! Varun! - What is it, dude? Wouldn't the tickets for Sundown be sold out months in advance? Then how are we going to arrange it in this last minute? Do you think l'll promise that without finding some way? l shall arrange the tickets. Dude! You are the man! The lightning! The thunderstorm! Unnikrishnan! l'll be right back! See how you're walking! ls this how you dress? Tuck in your shirt! We can dress like this too! What is this? - Not what. Who! Here! Why are you hiding it? ls your face so ugly or what? Oh! This is why? Go to the office, pay Rs. 1000 as fine and then enter this lab. Do you have Rs.1000 on you? As a loan? You know how difficult it is to write a love letter? What's special today? l will be the female staff who's coming along with you for your l.V. l will be the male staff accompanying you forthe l.V. from tomorrow. Move! l want one! Don't take all of them! All this is okay. Girlfriends & boyfriends will not be allowed to sit together. There are strict orders from the department. - Phew! l'm relieved now. lt's really bad that they won't allow us to sit as couples. Get lost man! First, you go talk to her, and then you can think of sitting together as a couple. lf Pristu was the one saying this, it was fine Come, come closer. l'll show you something! lf you have any plans of smoking & drinking, forget it. l will be checking all your bags tomorrow. What do we do with all the bottles we bought? Notjust one or two bottles, but 5 litres. That too, hard drinks. lf he catches us, our l.V will be over then & there! l can think of only one option. lt's a little risky! You! Son, you? Aren't you the one who came to book the bus the other day? Yes brother. This is my friend. Friend? Sir will be checking our bags. So we thought we'll hide the bottles in the bus. -And where did you hide them? - Below the seat where Sir is going to sit. Nice! The perfect place to hide from yourteacher. Under his ass! Carry on guys! Okay! Good night! Hey kids! My heart tells me.. this will be one helluva trip. Have a blast! So good night! Go take bath, man! 'Long ago, there was a veteran teacher in a town' 'He was very clever, but could not draw a picture' 'That became a problem! The kids couldn't understand anything!' 'And they failed in all their exams!' 'That fellow was hellbent on finding a way,' 'He took his disciples to a place far away' 'To see all that they hadn't seen before' 'The story got reversed & they passed in all the exams!' Get lost! 'As time went by, this story became the talk of the town' 'And gradually, it became a routine' 'To roam around the world easily; l.V became a synonym forthat'. 'This routine is still going on, and here goes some more people for the same'. 'Aanandam' (Joy) 33.. 34, 34 and a half, 36,37,38.. Get lost! Dude! Smile! You're my sweetheart! - Did you bring the portable charger? Diya? Why isn't this getting over? - There are no bottles in them, right? l wanted to check your bags. Why not? Please check them, Sir. You can start with mine! There are no bottles, Sir. Such a grumpy guy! Make it fast. Has everyone boarded? Everyone has boarded. Come. Let's head to Hampi. One person is yet to come! Who? What? MBRHDRG - What's your name? - And yours? What are you staring at? - Did you like her? - You didn't like her?. So you like her?. Then do one thing. Propose to her. Why are you laughing? She's acting smart! So you don't have to propose. - You propose to him. Ya! Say yes, Akshay! l can't live without you, Akshay! Say yes, Akshay. Please Akshay! That's enough! Why aren't you saying yes? Say yes! Say it, Akshay. Say yes! - One second. He will say yes now. Enough? Where were you all this while? You don't have any luggage? Yes. There it is. Has she run away from her house or what? MBRHDRG 'lt's a gleaming path ahead' 'The heart is getting prepared' 'While eyes are opened,' to all the happiness up ahead' Get into the bus! That Dosa wasn't good. Do you read the newspaper? The sports page alone. On the front page, there's only murder & corruption. But on the sports page - lndia won, Messi's comeback.. Aren't you ashamed to read & enjoy about all this murder & corruption? Read the sports page man! Sadist! 'The world is going backwards' 'Let's go forward right away' Sir, where is this 'Mysore park'? 'Far away' 'To a place unknown' ls it an earthquake?

This guy! - Shall we go there? You've fallen hard for her, eh? l don't know how to make you understand. Her crooked teeth, croaky voice, how she comes to class without even taking a bath.. With every imperfection of hers that l see, l find herto be even more perfect! When everyone else talk about her looks, dressing sense and hairstyle, l've never looked at all that. Then what do you look at? Sheesh! Dude, what is she going to do to you; to be so scared of her? Not her, l'm scared of what l'm going to do. You guys are her friends. Your girlfriend is her best friend. lf l propose to her and she says 'No', everything will be spoiled, right? Right now she is at least smiling at me when she sees me. lf that's also gone... We have three years left. How will l face her? All this is if she says 'No', right? What if she says 'Yes'? Me and you are friends. Our girlfriends will also be friends. We have three years left. Whatever you said right now, will be flipped! Why don't you think like that? Hey! Come! lt's time for breakfast! Come. - Rest we can talk after having an awesome Hampi Dosa. (Playing Antakshri) Sing a song that starts with 'T'. 'Thamarappoovil' (Popular Malayalam song starting with T) So apart from your growling, you know songs that normal humans sing as well? Austin had called me. Don't forget to practice. - l won't! What are you listening to? - lron Maiden. - Okay! ls Yesudas the lead singer of lron Maiden? You dumbo! Look over there! - Nice. - Okay okay. l'll be right back. -Are you busy? - Yes. Dude, you'll get a chance to spend a full day with Diya now. How? l don't have time to explain. Those Northies are getting impatient. Northies? Enough. Enough, brother. Long back, during Dussehra festivals, the King used to stand on top of this and watch dances, songs and military marches. Stop your history class, man! Show us the next place. Hampi is not a place to be shown by someone. lt should be explored on your own. Today, for ourfirst day in Hampi, 4 clues, 4 locations, 4 hours. Spread all over Hampi, a massive treasure hunt! l'll give you a clue right now. When you solve it, you'll reach the next location. And there, you'll get the next clue. So the first person who reaches the finish line by solving all 4 clues, will get a special surprise! What's the surprise? l'll you what it is. But first, form teams.

Devika? Not me. Me and Gautham, please? Sweetheart! Okay. That's enough. Are all of you ready? l'm going to say the first clue. 'The sinner always goes to hell' So all the best! Play it! Shall we also try? - Should we? - Why not? Hell? See if something is buried here. What does 'Paapi' (sinner) mean? What is this, man? l'll search online. You check the book. - Where do we look? Gautham, l found the answer. lt's not fun being alone. Shall l also join you guys? You found it? No one has figured it out. We're the first ones. We found it! We got it! We also got it! Hey, where do people who sin go to? Either ajail, or hell. People who sin will go to a church to make a confession! Got it! Come! - Diya, wait! - Didn't l tell you that she'll solve it? Come! What? lf you sin, you ask forforgiveness at.. a temple. And hell, is underground. So what? So beautiful. True. Just like my house! No one else has reached. l think we're first. Not first. We're the last. No one else is around. This is the best chance. Go! - Have the results come? - Go! - One minute. Go! You guys search inside. l'll search outside, okay? She's gone! Varun, we need to talk. - What's there to talk? - Varun, please. The clue is in there. But it's water all around. l'll set you right. Go take it, man! You scumbag! Varun, you were the first person l met afterjoining college. Of course, we became really close. But l thought you would understand. l am like this. l'll become friends with everyone easily. A haunted house in Hampi? Oh my God! You said a lot of things that day. But l forgot all of that immediately. Even afterthat, l've always behaved normally to you. But you.. l hope there are sweets in the box! Sheesh! Clue! We are in the same class. We have the same friends. How long will you avoid me like this? l got the clue. Come! Come dear! We have to solve the next clue quickly, overtake everyone, and finish first. - Go slowly man! Your bag! From here, you should go to 'Queen's bath'. Once you get there, 'Don't worry. Be Hampi' This is the place. Come fast! Awesome! Devutty, look. Was this a bathroom? Looks like a palace. lf l had such a huge bathroom, l would be bathing all the time! First you bathe at least once a day, the rest you can do after that.. Shwetha, just search for the clue over there. - What happened, Devutty? - Nothing! What is it? Tell me! - l said nothing. - Don't get angry! Tell me the matter. How many times have l told herthat her behaviourtowards you is not right? She is just being friendly.. Friendly! You are an idiot! You don't know how girls are. You do whatever you want. l'm leaving. Why should l care about her behaviour? l have my Devutty, right? Stop kidding! Your eyes.. -And it's so beautiful when you eat mangoes & it gets stuck on your teeth! - Get lost! - l swear! l didn't see anything! l saw everything! l saw a little! We were just.. Nice place! l wish l was born as a soldier here. Why? See.. The walls are full of holes. l could've seen the queens bathing every morning for free! - Sheesh! Pervert! - Pervert? Hey! Stop there! MBRHDRG You chose the best guy to help you out! l won't give it! 10 Rupees for postcards! Jagannath + 7. lsn't that a temple? That's in Puri, man. Puri? ls this the one? - These kids' clues are so difficult. - l told you that we'll stay away! Who is this Jagannathan? lt's been so long. [Dialogue excerpt from a Mohanlal movie 'Aaram Thampuran' (Sixth Emperor)] Jagannathan! Not Jagannath. lt's Jagannathan. Emperor. Emperor Jagannathan from Kanimangalam Palace. - Sixth Emperor. - Plus Seven. 12th.. 13th Emperor. Sri Krishna Deva Raya. The statue looks nice! But he doesn't have the looks to be an emperor. - But our Mohanlal has it! - That's true! You know what? There was a Portuguese traveller in the 15th century. He came to Hampi after visiting London, Paris, Rome, etc. He said that Hampi was the most beautiful city in the world. And this is the man who built this whole city. Back then, the population here was around 5 lakhs. But now there are only 3000 people here. Why? Religion, caste, riots, quarrels.. Same old story. Even after 600 years, we are still the same, right? Clue. This is not a tower. This is something else. What else can it be? - l have seen this somewhere. - l know. l've seen it too. But l don't remember where l saw it. lsn't this that temple? l've seen it somewhere! - Virupaksha temple. - Ya. Come. Let's go. Virupaksha temple! Come! Let's go! Dude, that one... Virupaksha temple. Come! Wait.. Aren't you coming? This is the last clue, man. Varun won't make it so simple. What? Dude! This should be seen like this. lt's not a tower! lt's a floor plan! See! Vithila temple. Climb up! Varun! Varun, give us our first prize. You are first? l knew it! We came first! Kuppi! You aren't first either! Then who won? Him. He's been here for 3 hours after solving all the clues. Mirash? - You wanna know what's the first prize? - What is it? Bring all the others. Musical pillars. This place is really famous forthem. These people don't come here & perform every day. l thought this experience would be the best gift you could get in Hampi. MBRHDRG 'Through these open paths, with strong footsteps, keep travelling ahead' 'With open eyes, with new desires, search for the hidden thoughts inside you.' 'lf you want to go far, you have to go together, friends' 'Through these open paths, with strong footsteps, keep travelling ahead' Day 1 is over, right? Now we can go back to the room & open the bottles! Bro, You are the man! The lightning! The thunderstorm! Move, man! 'While everyone else was looking at the camera, one guy alone was focusing elsewhere.' - Come, come! - Fast! Keep quiet, man! Go fast. Before someone comes. Get in! Come on! What? We're screwed! - Did someone kidnap our bottles? - No dude! This is some loser classmate of ours trying to mess with us. - This is no child's play! - No! Those bottles were bought with the money we collected for l.V. - l'm fed up of making false accounts! - Fed up! lf l find the guy who did this.. Mummy! Hey! l found this underthe seat. Let me see. 'Answers on the other side' Our classmates used to talk normally to each other so far. But now they talk only in clues. Clues! Suffer now! Who is in the room opposite ours? Mirash. He would faint even if he gets a slight smell of alcohol. No chance! Kuppi, opposite yours? Chacko Sir. lt's really likely that he would've done this. From his eyes, we can figure out that he's a huge tank. Dude, if it was Sir, this l.V would've been finished by now! You guys keep playing these riddles! Why is he getting angry for that? - Lovely Miss. - Shut up, man! - She's from Kanjirappally. - One tight slap! Hey, come here! What is it? Answers, on the other side. So many steps! l don't see any boat or bridge here. The closest bridge is 40 kilometers away. What do we do now? There's one way. Pick it up! Come on! - Get in! - Come on! Hey! Aren't you coming? No way! The undercurrents would be really strong. 8-10 people travel by this everyday, man! There's no problem! Just come! - That's when the driver is there, right? - Driver? Come here, you! How're you so sure that the bottles would be there? l'll search in the hotel. Call me if you find them. Dude! Let's head south, guys! Why aren't we reaching anywhere? Dude, careful! - Argh! The key is with Gautham! - Cheers! - Pour it. - Open the Lays packet. - lt's overthere. Hey Varun, l am scared. Shall we go back? lf you're scared, you can go back! l'm not coming anywhere without giving a dose to the guy who took this. Dude, go slowly. We're also coming! Gautham, hold my hand! MBRHDRG - Open the door! - Someone's knocking! Who is it? l see! So you guys stole our bottles? Tell me the truth! Where are the rest of the bottles? You gave just one bottle & now you're asking forthe rest? - What is this, man? - One bottle? Who gave it to you? Oh Varun! After coming to Hampi, is it enough if we see some broken down palaces alone? A side of Hampi which is not exposed to the outside world. There are no lndians here. And ya, it becomes active only in the night! You guys were not going allow that anyway. That's why we did this.. What? Yes Sir! Hey, what did he say? We are his first lndian customers today. That's nice! You guys sit here. We will bring them. Come! - l'll be right back! - Good set up! Dude, come here! Are we going to drink? - That won't be right! - Why? Will hell break loose if girls drink? Their lives shouldn't be constrained to the four walls of our classroom. - But l didn't mean that.. Aren't you both fed up of making them suppress their desires & feelings? - What did l do? - l didn't know that you guys were so.. Racist! - Sexist! - Case closed! What's she talking about? She has traveled all around lndia. Even Kerala. Selfie with foreigner madam! 'You scaredy cat! We're having fun here!' Shucks! No signal here! So strange! These guys are the ones who've seen more of lndia than us. lt's very nice to hear all this. But to roam around like this, you need a lot of money! - Ya right! You can go to Bekal Fort if you pay just 7.50 for a ticket from your house. How many times have you gone there? He hasn't gone! -Are you drunk? - Quite a bit! Saw that? These guys are really enjoying their lives! These guys live for themselves. What does that mean? That means.. Our parents lived for us. Now after some time, we will live for our kids. And this will keep going on like a cycle. lf we live for ourselves, who will live for our kids? Let them live their lives for themselves! After 20 years, at this same place, on this same day, at this same time, all of us will reach here. Give me your hand! Come on! You remember, back then at the electrical lab, that schmuck Chacko Sir asking for my l.D. card? He asked me to pay 1000 Rupees fine, man! 1000 Rupees! That idiot missed all of this, right? What to do? lt is his own fault. He is scared of water, he is scared to sit, scared to walk, scared of heights.. How can someone be so scared of everything? Darshana, can't you recognize me from my face? You will! She will! Does Gandhiji have an lD card? No! You gave me 1000 bucks! l love you! l've planned a surprise for you in Goa. Surprise? Like this... - Shall l tell you something? - Move! l want to see him right now! And tell him that l'll finish him! l'm Kabali, l say! Oh God! How did they... You too. The l.V. is over with this. All of you pack your bags. We're going back to Kerala tomorrow. Spineless, scaredy-cat, what all did you call me? Didn't l warn you not to do any of this? And see what happened! By the way, what are you going to tell the others? That the l.V. got cancelled because you went to random bars with girls? - Not bar. lt was a shack. - Shut up! Bloody! l thought at least you would show some responsibility. But why! People have come to enquire. l don't have anything to do with this! What to do? Should l sit like this? Dude, taking the bottles away, that clue & going to the bar; all of it was their plan. So? You should allow that? You should have made them understand that it's not right for girls to drink & roam around at night, and brought them back to their rooms! lnstead of hanging out the whole night with them, and having fun.. Boys can drink, smoke.. watch blue films.. watch blue films, and roam around all night! lf a girl does this, it become an issue? l didn't think that you guys were so sexist. Racist! That's true. We are really sexist. - Didn't l tell you that it's 'Racist'? - Shut up! l'll kill you! The fault is not yours. We're the ones who took you there. There's no point arguing about all this anymore. We should figure out what to do next. lf Akshay helps us, this can be solved. lf Sir is impressed by anyone at all in class, that would be him. - ls it? - Of course! (Morning prayer song) Your bloody hippie village trip! And you had to go there in that basket itself! Going out from the hotel without our knowledge, drinking; that too with girls, do you know how huge this issue will be if we inform your parents? Ask all the students to pack their bags & come to the restaurant. We have to leave before noon. Before the l.V. started, we had only very few conditions. But.. last night, some of you.. broke all those conditions together. He has begun his counseling. What all did we plan! Bullshit! l can't imagine facing the rest of the class. Dude, leave it! MBRHDRG Such a situation shouldn't happen hereafter. Okay? A doctorfrom America. Mom's choice. Dad has also approved. l came for this l.V. to escape from meeting him. But now the l.V. is cancelled, right? Now l have no other option than meeting him. How will l make her fall for me then? l feel sad when l see all yourfaces. Goa? Let the American go back to America, Lovely. We shall go to Goa. This thing was waiting forthe l.V. to start to break down! Dude, how did Sir change his mind? Simple! Sir is behind Miss! Strong love! How do you know that? You should go to the staff room at least once in a while! But how! You don't even come to the classroom! Then we should go say thanks to Sir. What say? Before thanks, let's tell him sorry first. No need for an apology. Even otherwise, it's not right to punish all the others for a problem created by the few of you. Just see that you don't create anymore problems. - Let's go. -Akshay! You want to say something to someone, right? Nothing happens in the classroom without the teachers' knowledge. Hey, l'm saying this to you too! You're standing here? Aren't you coming? Come fast, Sir. Err.. l.. l'll come right now. l'm right behind you. What? What's the joke? Tell me! Let me also have a laugh. Without the students' knowledge, nothing happens in the staff room as well! Err.. Nothing like that. Watch it & come! 'So after a beautiful sunset in Hampi, all of them started from there to watch the sunrise, to Goa'. Dude! Shall we play a movie? Everyone sit down please! - We're going to play a movie. - Diya. Please come here. Can you play this movie? Go ahead! Oops. Don't stand like a pillar in front of the TV & go sit somewhere! You stole my seat! Get lost! You get lost! Just this once. Both of us. Carry on! Who is it? Are you particular about sitting in the window seat? Huh? Are you particular about sitting in the window seat? Err.. No. But l am! Aren't you sitting? When l was insisting on sitting in the window seat, you would've thought that l am crazy, right? A little bit. lf you look outside from here, you can dream with your eyes open. Who is it? Dad! l won't be relieved until l tell him what happened everyday. - He calls you everyday? - Earlier he used to. But now we've switched to WhatsApp. So.. yesterday you were texting? Who else? Dad only! Great! 'Has my world blended into the moonlight unknowingly?' 'Have l forgotten what l always yearned to tell you?' - Narasimham (Action) - Thattathin Marayathu (Romance) 'Traveling through the narrow paths of this silent night' You're scared of the dark, right? Shall l tell you a secret? Okay. l was even more scared of the dark than you are. Long back, during power cuts, l used to cry and create a ruckus! l mean.. l didn't cry.. l used to create a small ruckus. So one fine day, Dad made me sit on his lap, and showed me the stars in the sky. You don't have to be scared of what you can't see. You just have to enjoy the beauty of what you can see. 'Have l forgotten what l always yearned to tell you?' MBRHDRG Nice. Go! Dude, go! She's moving. Did you kiss her? Get lost! You little devil! lsn't it so beautiful just to watch the girl we love even while she's sleeping? lt'll be like that for the first week alone! Why are you sitting here? When was the last time you watched a sunrise? The sun rises and sets everyday. But no one is really bothered about it. Sometimes l think that.. lf everyone just paused to watch the sunrise at least once in a while, there wouldn't have been so many problems in this world. Diya means 'Light'. You loser! So you bored her by being so cheesy last night? Sheesh! Get lost man! Hey. Varun is here. Look! The stay is good man! Great place! - Dude, come! - Coming. We'll eat something & come! - What are you doing? - l'm making tea. - l know. - l'll teach you. One second. - Eat Devu. - l don't want. - Have at least little. - l ate a lot last night. l'm not hungry. - That was dinner. And this is breakfast. Come on. Eat it properly. lf this causes some problem, l'll take care of that. So this is your full-time job? Now try it! l forgot. l'm sorry. Hey! Hey! What happened last night? Didn't you guys tell me.. that you've to make a girl smile to make her fall for you? Last night she was smiling a lot, bro! But every time she smiled, l was the one who was falling harder for her. He's a really sweet guy. Very decent! l haven't seen him looking at any girl so far. But l think he has some soft cornerfor you. Don't talk rubbish. He seems to be a nice guy. Did l say that he is not? But such nice guys have a greater chance of falling for you. - Dude, aren't you coming? - No! You guys carry on. One minute. l'll just come. - l heard something about you. - What? That you're deeply in love with me? Sheesh! Nothing like that! These guys are just making false rumours. When college starts, we would discuss about the girls in class, right? So l said that you looked cute. Since then they've been going on.. So you admit that l'm cute? l thought so back then.. But now, not at all! Dude, wait! Wait! Ever since l can remember, l have had many boys as friends. But.. there's just one problem. Everyone ends up coming behind me saying 'l love you'. With that, the friendship would be closed! Why are you looking like that? You think that l'll also come behind you like that? No, no, no! By the way, you were the one who came and sat near me by yourself. My fear is whether you are behind me! Get lost! Don't push me! 'Like the sweet talks of little waves in the gentle breeze,' 'My heart talks on its own, on seeing you, my darling' 'The distances our hearts are traveling', 'Distances hitherto unseen' This is my father. This is my mom. This was taken when l went to meet my cousin's gang studying in Christ College. This is some distant cousin of my dad's. And ya, this is my favourite teacher. lsn't it cruel to make the kids sit separately? - Shall we set an example? - How? Like this. 'While the morning keeps following your footsteps as a routine', When was the first time we talked? July 22nd 2015, Tuesday. When we got a free period, you asked me forthe textbook. 'When new paths spread out before us' 'We'll merge as shadows under the same shade' 'The distances our hearts are traveling' 'Distances hitherto unseen' That girl never talks to anyone or what? You know how many people have asked me this? She's always on her own with that book of hers. Can l see it? Gosh! Don't do all that! She'll kill you! How did you become friends? Diya, Devika, Darshana. When l heard that name, l decided immediately, that we will be thick friends for the next four years! Because of her name? But to be frank, we are like a family now. 'These raindrops will shower on me as your breezy smiles' 'Slowly embracing me as a cool wave, my dear sunshine' 'Like the sweet talks of little waves in the gentle breeze,' 'My heart talks on its own, on seeing you, my darling' 'The distances our hearts are traveling' 'Distances hitherto unseen' - Hold this! - This? This is not how you should be dressed in Goa! Take it off! Come on! Sheesh! You have nothing there? Sheesh! Here you go! Nice! So you also crack jokes, Lovely? Hey, it's time for your surprise. We'll escape at the next stop. Okay? Just us? Then what? Should we call everyone else for all this? For what? Let that be. You just have to come with me. l.. l have to ask Varun. You need Varun's permission for everything or what? MBRHDRG Did she say where you are going? No! - - Diya, wait! Shall l? So you'll be singing duets from now on? Did she say what you are going to do? - She told me not to call anyone else. Look at you! So you're going to turn into an adult? - Sheesh! Sheesh? This is what people say! The bat should be given to the guy who can hit with it! Sheesh! - Does he want to be a celibate growing all that hair & beard? We don't want to be the pricks in your paradise. l'll see to it that the teachers don't notice it. But you have to be back on time. Done! l'll do that! No, no! Wait! You're going as a boy. Come back as a man! Come. Let's go! Got it? You paid the money? - Yea! - You are slow! - That's true! Can't you go faster? - Huh? Just go fast! Devutty, where are we going? Just wait! Don't let the map fly away! This way! This way! Ya! That one! Devutty, what place is this? This is the place. Go slowly! Come fast! l can't. l'm going back. This doesn't look good. Come! - lt's right here. - Where are you taking me? They'll reach now. Who is this guy? Devu! She is part of the Russian Mafia or what? What's the connection between you & the Russian Mafia? His organs are in place. Tell me the truth! Why did you bring him here? Uri had designed a couple tattoo for us. Couple tattoo? Take her away! For both of us, a matching couple tattoo like this. Couple tattoo? Dude, what is he saying? l think he is really sad about what happened. - He's saying that he will give us guns! - Guns? Dude, you fainted seeing what? - Needle. Huh? Needle. l've been scared of needles since childhood. 'So Rockstar Gautham came to be known as Needle-boy, and Devika as Tattoo-girl.' What happened? What happened? - l can't see anything here. - l thought a needle struck me. Get lost! 'Tattoo-girl, who realized that the journey forward won't be smooth, became furious!' Tattoo-girl! Needle-boy! Tattoo-girl! Needle-boy! Tattoo-girl, Needle-boy, how come you're coming with us? You don't have anymore strange rituals like couple tattoos? Get lost! Dude, happy? Do you some otherfearthat l'm not aware of? Like cockroaches or lizards? lf there's something like that, tell me right now. l don't have the skill to guess it from your mumbling. We've reached the jungle. Everybody get down. This has 21 gears. You're wearing a Sari & riding a cycle? There are coquets in the jungle too? l was the cycling champion in MG University. Until 2002.. Oops. Why is it like this? l think this is a new model. See. This is my elder brother. He's quite good looking! Ya! My brother was really studious. A real intellectual! Soon after 10th standard, he had decided.. Engineering from llT, MBA from llM, 2 years job experience in some leading international company. And then to quit all that, & start his own company! And then? Last month was his company's one year success party. At this age of mine, my brother knew what he wanted for the next 10 years! And me, l don't even know which elective to choose in the next semester. Hey, stop! There's something wrong with my brake. Ya. Brake. Check the brake. What happened? Come! Come! - Come! Come! - Where are you taking me? You could've told her that you were scared of needles, right? Why? You can't say that? Dude! lf you see me, would you think that l'd be scared of needles? So you're not? l am! Then why couldn't you say that you were not interested? Dude, it's not as easy as you think it is. You will understand all that only when you get a girlfriend. He won't let me be in peace for even 5 minutes! Going on asking me to practice! He thinks that the people over there will be queuing up to listen to our songs! Tell me the truth! Do you like our songs? Should l say the truth? - Yea! lt sucks to the core! Dude, l also want to learn Hindustani & Classical music. They haven't tied you up, right? lf you don't want it, quit it! Dude, from the time Devika saw me, l have been like this. Rockband, growling, and all these black T-shirts! Bullshit! One fine day if l say l don't like any of these, she will.. What will she think? What will she think? She fell in love with you seeing your black T-shirt or what? lf you can't even talk openly about such silly things, what kind of a relationship are you in? Devika is a sweet girl. We all know her. All this won't be an issue for her! You are over thinking! Dude! -Aren't you coming? - You carry on. We will come. Dude! Should l deliberately rip apart the Tyre of a car which is riding smoothly? Dude, right now, you just have to change the Tyre alone. lf you keep going like this, you'll have to change the whole car itself. Change the Tyre? What? What's wrong with this Tyre? Have you had a girlfriend? l've always wanted one. But no one wanted me. What about you? Even though l've had many boys as friends, l've never felt that l need boyfriend until now. There are chances that you might feel so in the nearfuture, right? We've reached! Come. Let's go! What are you looking at? Come! Come! Over here? Tell me. Truth or dare? Choose 'Dare', you scaredy-cat! l will choose an adventure sport. You will have to do it. Para sailing! lt's so scary to even hear that. What is it? You're scared of anything & everything! lf you only want to do things that you're not scared of, why is it called a dare? Whatever you say next, l'll do that. Got it! Bungee jumping? Me? lt will be awesome! All your fears will be gone forever! l'll also be gone forever! You're breaking your first promise itself?. MBRHDRG lf you're scared, don't do it. Leave it. lt's okay. l have avoided many things in life because of my fear. l want to do this. Can you give me your phone? That's my number. l'll call you after freshening up. For the campfire, shall we go together? Her number.. She will give it to me herself. Wait & watch! Where's my jacket? - Dude, that.. - Dude, what? l saw you draping her. Next time when you feel so affectionate, buy a raincoat for her! Understood? What's up? ls it time to change your 'single' status on Facebook to 'in a relationship'? Sheesh! No man! We'rejust getting to know each other. Even otherwise, she is not ready for a relationship now. She can't be blamed for that. She saw you just yesterday, right? - Not that. - Then what? - Did someone dump her? - No! Did she dump someone? No man! ls she a lesbian? - No dude! - Then what? - Her parents got divorced! Sorry? Even they haven't told me that so far. And you're saying it? They had a lot of issues between them. But.. l never expected that mom would walk out.. That's why l didn't come for class last week. l didn't want to come for the l.V. as well. But when l sit at home, l'm reminded of so many things! Dude, don't tell this to anyone else. Dude, don't tell anyone! l won't. This is nice! Very romantic! What's your intention? lsn't this our first date? So l thought it should be a little romantic. Date? Where did you get this from? - The shells were easy. lt was a little tough to get the Tyre though. Why aren't you talking about your parents to anyone? l have 8 cousins. All this while, we were an unruly bunch. But ever since they came to know about mom & dad, they have only sympathy for me. l've had enough of that! At least, in front of these guys, l'm still the old Diya, right? Let it be like that only. Diya, it's the song we heard yesterday. ln the bus, on the earphones! Come! MBRHDRG 'Has my world blended into the moonlight unknowingly?' 'What l've always yearned to tell you' - Devutty, please. - Leave me. - Don't say anything now, Devu! - Diya! Why didn't you tell us anything? We are with you! Devika, leave me! Didn't l tell you not to tell anyone else? Am l just someone else? l'm his girlfriend! So you think he tells you everything? Akshay, don't! First tell her what you have to say. Then you can talk about others. What's the problem? What's he talking about? What is it? What's the problem here? - Hey! - Huh? Did you smoke up? Yes children, l smoked up! Let me tell you some truths. Gautham is really scared of you. And because of that, he doesn't say a lot of things to you, Kuppi! and he'll always have a mask when he's with you. lsn't that bad? And you! When you spread your light all around, many have been burnt by it. And one among them, is him. Where? -At least, don't do the same with Akshay. - Kuppi, come with me! - Go to your room. - Varun, l'm not finished! What is he talking about? Why do you wanna know? To say it to everyone else? - Diya, l haven't said anything! - Don't say that! Dude, staying up during midnight in the bus and talking to her, telling her 'l love you'; - Dude, stop it! almost kissing her after the bungee jump; Didn't you tell me about all this? Leave me! lt's not like what you think! - l can't say it now! - Why can't you? - l can't say! That's it! - Why can't you? Did l create a problem here? Get lost man! Kuppi, open the door. l can't. l have a lot of things to do. Open the door. l won't. l have to talk to you guys. You can leave afterthat. Today, today is the last day of our l.V. l've been behind all of you since morning to solve this somehow. lt's true that last night l said a lot of things l shouldn't have said. But what l said wasn't wrong! lt was the truth, right? lt's a problem between us. We'll solve it ourselves. - You don't have to interfere. - But l will interfere. l have no other option! You just want Diya to fall for you somehow, you want to be with Devika all the time, and you think this l.V. is some world cup. Each one of you had your own reasons to come for the l.V. But have you guys thought about why l came for this trip even once? l just wanted to have some fun with you guys, you douche bags! lt might sound really silly. But until now, l haven't even been able to click a single photo with all of us together. l'm not telling that you guys shouldn't be with Diya or Devika, or that you shouldn't do yourjob! But this precious time when we are together, don't waste it by fighting against each other. MBRHDRG Dude, 'Dil Chahta Hai' (Movie) was shot here, right? Of course! After coming to such a famous spot, isn't it really bad if we don't take at least a single photo? lt will be really bad. But.. we need a camera to take a photo, right? l don't have a camera. l have a camera with me. So now we just need someone to click the photo. l don't know how to take photos. - Do you know? - Not at all! What about you? Even l don't know. Now who will do it for us? Enough. Go stand there. l'll click. Kuppi, you were here? l didn't see you, l swear! Don't overact! Go stand there. Sorry dude. - Give me the camera. Sorry sweetheart. We won't fight again! Come here! Sorry bro! Go.. Go stand there. What? Go stand there, you idiot. That thing which Aamir Khan leaned on is gone, dude! lt's been 15 years, right? Even otherwise, what's there that will survive for so many years? Devutty, don't cut the call. Please. What is it? l'm not the kind of person you think l am. l have anotherface. Another face? Who are you? A ripper?. Or a gangster? l'll make you understand all that. There's a library right next to you. Can you please come there? Oh dear! What is this? What is this man? l haven't seen it so far. lt's nice, dude. Suits you. Why the hell can't you pick up the phone? How long have l been calling you? Did you forget about next weeks' competition? We haven't practiced much. And you.. What happened? Why don't we stop this? To be frank, our band's songs are really pathetic. They suck to the core! Aren't you in your final year now? Study something, get a placement & try to be settled in life, man! Nonsense! Say something, Devutty. You needn't have shortened it so much. 'So, by solving the problems one by one, they reached the tour's last location to celebrate New Year's eve. Sundown party.' Hey Gautham, can you come with me? - One second. lt has not even been a year since we met. There are a lot of things that we need to know about each other. 'After planning everything so carefully, Varun never expected such a setback. All of them lost their money, the New Year plans were ruined, and Varun became really sad.' 'But there was something else which Varun never expected.' Dude, why are you saying sorry? Leave it, man! l'll get the money from you later. Shut up you idiot! 'That his friends wouldn't stop supporting him just like that'. you don't have to worry at all! l'm there for you! l mean, we are all there for you. All of us! Did you hear that? All of us, it seems! All of them are openly saying what they wanted to say, do you have something to say, teacher?. - No! Varun, lf not Sundown party, we'll find some other party! You think it's difficult to find a party in Goa? 'Even while everyone was searching for a party, Diya was still upset. And because of that, Akshay wasn't really interested in searching for a party. But..' - You're a Malayali? - Yes. There's a party happening inside. A foam party organized by a major Malayali shark! Can you get me tickets forthat one? lt's not suitable for your size & age. Bro, please don't say that. Somehow.. Please. lt's almost over. Anyway, you can go in & watch. Wh.. Where? Okay brother. Thanks. MBRHDRG So you're brothers? Yes. Shucks! Missed a chance! Yourfavourite, Sir. lt was a New Year party l threw for my colleagues. l haven't told anyone at home. lf l say that you were dancing with foreign ladies covered in foam, not just parents, even friends won't believe it. You know what? l haven't gone for a single l.V. yet. l know that very well. Dad had called me even today. Because you ran around getting first ranks everywhere, it's hard for me to survive at home. l didn't run. l was forced to run. When the entire family is full of engineers, doctors & civil servants, we can't blame them for wanting us to reach an llT at least. There's something that l have learned. Our parents are always worried about our well-being. But we can make certain decisions better than them. From the day you realize that, things will be smooth. lt's easy to talk after being so successful. And me? When l think about the future, l'm really confused. Who doesn't have confusion in your age? Do you think l wasn't confused? Only if you are confused now, you can be confident in your future. Don't break your head over all these things, and try to enjoy the small moments in your campus life. l.V, Arts Festival, Farewell, and college romance. Whateverthat has to be done during these days, cannot be recreated later however much we try. Hey! Where were you all this while? We've been searching for you everywhere! - Dude, this is my brother. Brother?. This beard-o? Akash! Brother! What about the party? Like Chacko Sir said, there are plenty of parties in Goa. But there are tickets for none. What's the problem? l forgot to tell you. The tickets we bought for Sundown were fake. All of us are looking for another party. By the way, is some party happening here? - This one just got over. - What to do now? Goa is really huge. l don't have any idea where to start. Come! This is the oldest shack here. No party will happen in Goa without being on this wall. My flight is at 7. l have a meeting early in the morning itself. Don't tell anyone at home that you saw me here. Okay then. Find a party, and enjoy new year's eve with your friends. What party! l have given up! Hey, don't be tensed about Diya. People say that women are really complicated, and no one can understand what they want, etc. But.. any woman's anger would be long gone if you say a sorry from your heart. Shall l go? Dude, did you see a poster called 'Red Dawn'? All of you check for the Red Dawn poster. - lt was right here. - Don't look for anything else. Got it? - Dude, what happened? - Tickets are available. They said it's happening on a private island. l don't think it would fit in our budget. Dude, we will arrange the money! We will go there! We're short of 9000 Rupees. There's no one left to ask. lf you tell this to the HOD, teachers or other students, you will know see this Chacko's true face! But we can say this to Lovely Miss, right? Say it! Okay guys, our new year plans are finally confirmed. At 10.30 PM, everyone should wait in front of the hotel. From the hotel, straight to the port. From the port, straight to the boat, and from the boat, straight to a private island! Diya hasn't come? No. ls this Diya's father?. l'm her professor. Chacko Sir, right? l know. l had taken your number from her before she left. Sir, l called you to say something else. l heard that you're on strike over there? Your friends are waiting for you downstairs. l'm not in a mood. lt it because you're not in a mood or because it's difficult to face them? Dear, when l married your mother, l was 30 years old, and she was just 18. That is your current age. Even though we tried a lot, our interests weren't mutual. That's all! Your mom will always be a good friend to me, and vice versa. You're not going to lose anyone like you fear. These things which are making you sad right now, will seem funny to you in the future. So my dear, get ready quickly & enjoy this new year's eve with your friends! Go! Hey! Our heroine is here! Start the bus! - Come, children! Josetta, the boat will leave in 10 minutes. So speed away! Done! l'll take care of that! The boat is just reaching. Dude, it's not coming here. lt's going in the other direction. Can we get another boat? l don't think there's any other boat. That was the last one. What the hell are you looking for overthere? See, finally you needed me! - What for? - Look! Varun, you are nothing! Dear, you are the real, the man, the lightning, the thunderstorm! Uri brother! Russian mafia! MBRHDRG Josetta, Watch out for those two. Both don't know how to swim. - Keep an eye on them. - Where are you going? - To book the boat's return tickets. - Sit down! Hold this. Son, l'm not advising you. lf we think that our happiness should come only after our responsibilities, we will have time only for those responsibilities. And before the bat of an eyelid, our hair would've turned Grey. See this! l'll take care of yourtickets. You also make one of these, son. Hats off to you! You're really fond of making things with paper like this, right? l knew it when Akshay was going on stressing about this lantern festival. l wasn't the one who found this place, and brought us all here. lt was Akshay. Even though you've had many boys as friends, do you still think that you don't need a boyfriend? 'The distances our hearts are traveling', 'Distances hitherto unseen' 'The distances our hearts are traveling', 'Distances hitherto unseen' From tomorrow, we're back to the same old grind. Lab, assignments, seminars, the yucky hostel food.. Hey kids, come fast! At least something good happened to you guys because you came; when will my number come? Kuppi! Tell her your name. Pull up your shorts. - Go ahead! Say it like l taught you! Go on! l think Kuppi just won a lottery! Katthi (knife)? The bus will leave now. Hey, come let's take a photo. Make it fast! Let me focus! - Got it? - What the hell! - He wouldn't have clicked anything. - He didn't get it! ldiot! l should move? You move first! Very nice. Go that side! Please move! Even though it can't be said that the trip changed everyone's lives, certain small changes happened to each one of them. 'Varun isn't always furious alone like earlier.' 'He smiles once in a while now.' 'Gautham is not afraid of needles anymore.' 'And Devika who used to listen to English songs alone, has gradually started listening to Malayalam songs as well.' What's your name? 'Even though Akshay isn't the old Akshay, Diya is still the same old Diya.' - Did you like her? - You didn't like her? So you liked her. Then do something. - Propose to him. 'As soon as Chacko Sir opened his heart to her, Lovely Miss said Yes.' 'Some love stories are like that' 'There won't be any twist at all'. 'As boyfriend & girlfriend, Kuppi & Kathy started a wedding photography business together.' 'And they have a fair amount of likes on Facebook'. 'And ya, now about me.' 'That new year selfie which Kuppi couldn't capture; l drew it for him as well as l could.' 'So how did you like our small family?'
