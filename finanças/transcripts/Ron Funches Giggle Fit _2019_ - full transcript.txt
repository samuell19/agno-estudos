- I can do this. I'm strong. I'm powerful. I'm a fucking savage. Sure, maybe I shouldn't smoke so much weed before my special. Give me strength. Give... me... strength. - Whoo! Whoo! Ric Flair! - You have come to me for strength, my child? - Yes, Father. - In order to be the boss, you gotta pay the cost. To be the man, you gotta beat the man, baby. You want to swim in exquisite pools? - Yes! - You want alligator shoes that cost more than your house? - Yes! - You want to sit on a private jet getting your dick sucked by the pilot? - That doesn't sound safe. - Life isn't safe. It's about standing up for who you are. And if you're a weed-loving, wrestling-watching, giggle-fit-having son of a gun, then you gotta stand up for yourself. Whoo, whoo, whoo! Whoo! - Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! - Okay. Whoo! - Are you okay right now? Whoo! Ooh, I'm so happy to be here. My first hour comedy special, guys. My name is Ron Funches. If you know me, you might know already, I'm very hilarious. Got some good humor. If you don't know me, I'm happy to tell you about myself, tell you about my comedy. 'Cause it's a little different. I know a lot of comedians like to talk about things they hate, things that bother 'em, politics, stuff like that. I don't really do that. I like to talk about things I love and enjoy, they can be very specific, I love weed. I love it. Let's hang out after. Clearly, I love wrestling. Whoo! One of my favorite activities recently is just, like, staring at women in winter coats. Yeah. And just wondering, like, ooh, what's under there? And I know--I know a lot of dudes like bikinis, but I'm a winter coat motherfucker. Let me use my imagination. 'Cause it's a fun game. It doesn't bother anybody. It's not too creepy. It's a little creepy. But I still recommend it to anybody. I call it hidden figures. Which is what I thought that movie was about. Just a bunch of bitches doing math. Lately, I've been really into making, like, vision boards and dream boards and shit. Okay, you on there! Okay, okay, okay, okay! - That's right! - You got to. - You got to! - Why else you living? If you don't got dreams? - That's right. That's right. - If you guys don't know what a vision board is, it's where you take a list of goals, you can make a collage, you can do whatever you want with it, you have a list of goals, things you want to accomplish, they can be for your personal life, your spiritual life, your career. You can just put things you want to buy. It's okay. And you put that someplace where you can see it every day. I put mine in my bedroom, so as soon as I wake up, I sit up, and I can see it, and I can go, okay. These are the things I'm gonna focus on today. These are the things I'm gonna accomplish this year! And then sometimes, those things actually happen. But most of the time, they do not. It's very frustrating. But you still gotta have dreams. You gotta have goals, you know? Couple of years ago, in my apartment complex on New Year's Eve, I was having this little vision board party, just hanging out. Oh, you know how niggas be. We was just getting faded, supporting each other spiritually and shit. And my best friend, Gabe, was there, and Gabe asked me, he was like, "What's your biggest dream? You gotta be able to say it out loud if you want it to come true." I was like, my biggest dream, to tell you the truth, Gabe, I want a home base. I want to be able to have a house for me and my son. And then the next New Year's Eve, we had another vision board party... in my brand-new house. And I was like, oh, shit! Why didn't I ask for more stuff? I didn't think this would really work! So now I'm going crazy on these vision boards. I'ma tell you guys what I'm gonna get that's gonna come true. I'ma get two luxury vehicles. One to just smoke weed in. It don't even go nowhere. Ooh, I want to get this Japanese toilet. Oh, you know the one. That plays music and, like, lifts up automatically. Oh, I saw that, and I was like, I've been lifting up my own toilet seat like a fuckin' savage my whole life? I have goals. Sometimes they come true. It's a literal dream come true that I was able to buy a house for me and my son with stand-up comedy money. And I get to live next door to people who actually work. Oh, we took way different paths to get to the same destination. Oh, I feel so bad sometimes. I try to be active in my community. You know, like get up early, get my son on the school bus. I see everybody going off to work, and I'm just like, bye! You can do it! They come back at 6:00. I'm still in my PJs in the front yard. Just like, Welcome back! What was it like today? Did you make it in time for bagels, or did Debra get to 'em first? And I live in a pretty nice neighborhood. I see people going to work in their suits and ties, so I tried to copy them today. And I'm just like, aww! You're so fancy. You must be so important at your job. What do you do? Oh. I don't really know what most of those words mean. But it sounds very stressful. Oh, me? Oh, let's not compare. Oh, I just kind of get high and then mumble into a microphone. Did you know that was a lucrative profession? Guess I just had a better guidance counselor than you. She really pushed me into this line of work. I planned on working in finance. She was like, take this bong, and watch "Naked and Afraid" all day!" That's good advice. I love "Naked and Afraid." If you haven't seen it, "Naked and Afraid" is a reality competition show on the Discovery Channel, where they take two people and I want to say normal, but trust me... They are not. They take two people with some type of mental deficiency... And they remove them from their friends and family and put 'em someplace deep, dark, and dangerous. Like Honduras. Or Gainesville, Florida. That was a good episode! My second favorite reality show is just as intense as "Naked and Afraid." It's this little show called "RuPaul's Drag Race." Ooh. People got excited. You almost came over the railing for that one. And you should, it's a great show. It's a great show. Whenever I bring it up, I usually get a lot of women excited. Some guys act like they never even seen it before. Well, it's an amazing show. Everybody should watch it. It doesn't matter if you are male, female, gay, straight, bi, whatever. It's one of the best shows on television. Because the competitors... are mean... as fuck. They are so damn mean to each other! I guess there's something about having to hide who you truly think you are and also taping your dick backwards that gets you a little... They just know how to talk shit... so well... that they could just snatch the soul out of your body. Like only a real woman can. But then they fist-fight like grown-ass men! And then they have a lip sync competition! It's amazing television. It's like UFC, "The Voice," and "Say Yes to the Dress" all rolled up into one. But if you look at my personal experiences in life, oh, there is nothing meaner in this world... than a 12-year-old black girl. Terrifying. Just full of sass and confidence and beads flying everywhere. You gotta give 'em the beads so you can hear 'em coming. Otherwise, they just silent predators. I know that's a little bit of a harsh statement, so I'd like to tell you a story to prove my point a bit. Tell you about the time I saw a 12-year-old black girl. I was in New York City, just coming up out of the subway. Twelve-year-old black girl spotted me. And I didn't have time to run away. She just looks me dead in my eyes. And she just goes, oh. You're killing it. In a way that indicated I clearly was not. Who does that to a stranger? I didn't know her! That was five years ago. I'm still fucked up about it. I don't even want to talk about it no more. I'ma go in my happy place. Thank you. Talk about my favorite show. The best show on television. So sweet and charming. It's called "The Great British Baking Show." Oh! Hell yeah! I love that show! I love everything about it-- - Mary Berry! - Oh, girl, I love Paul Hollywood, first of all. I love Mary Berry, girl! I love Mary Berry! Ooh! I'ma figure out a way to impregnate that old lady. I'ma do it. I'ma do it! Believe in me. Love "The Great British Baking Show." If you don't know it, it's a baking competition show, obviously set in Great Britain, where they have no... prize... money. Why are you doing it? You're just baking for the love of cake? Oh! And I'm gonna stress, watch "The Great British Baking Show," because there is also a spin-off called "The Great American Baking Show." - No. - Boo! - Yeah. Fucking sucks. It's not sweet. It's not charming. It has this baker that looks like a magician, and I don't like that. If a competitor on "The Great British Baking Show" finishes a challenge early, do you know what they do? They go and help... The other competitors. What the fuck is that? We don't do that in American reality shows. You gotta set somebody on fire. If "The Great British Baking Show" was created in America, it'd just be called "Murder Cake." Two bakers walk in. You can fin-- you can finish it. However many you want. But I love baking shows. I love 'em. I love cooking shows. I love 'em even more lately. They're a great way for me to get my vices out, watching somebody else eat horrible foods while I drink a protein shake or whatever. So I'm sure some of you have never seen me before in your life, but... - You look great, Ron! - Thank you! Yeah. If you have seen me before, you might be aware, in the last two years, I've lost 140 pounds, which is a big deal for me. And I'm not done yet! I'ma get real healthy and not just American healthy. At my heaviest, I was 360 pounds, which is a lot of a human being. And at one point in my adult life, I was just like, Oh, I'll just probably never be under 300 pounds. Uh, but then my mom talked to me, some friends talked to me, and they got me motivated, and I got under 300 pounds, and I was like, This is pretty cool, but, you know, whatever. Probably never be under, like, 250. But I kept working out. Kept throwing up. But then after I threw up, I worked out. Then I got under 250, and I was like, oh, shit. I want to see how healthy I can get. And my friends are not supportive. I mean, they were at the start, you know, when I wasn't a threat to their sexual conquests. But now they're just like, okay, come on, Ron, calm down! You already sweet and charming. You got way more money than us. These are the things I think they be saying. I don't really be listening. I know what they say. 'Cause it hurts my feelings sometimes. Sometimes they'll just be like, look, Ron. Look, I hate to say it, but you're just not as fun as you used to be. You used to be so fun. Just eating cheese steaks and sweating all the time. We miss that guy. Now all you want to do is eat oatmeal, work out. Ugh. Why don't you be fun again? Come out with your boys. Do the things we used to do. We can get some midnight... secret pizza. And we don't have to tell nobody. 'Cause that's the only rule of secret pizza. We take this Tombstone to our grave. But I can't do that anymore. That's what I learned about myself, you know? As you get a little bit older, you learn more about yourself, your shortcomings. Instead of trying to fix every little thing, you just start to try to accept yourself, who you truly are. I just learned I'm just not the type of dude that can have secret pizza. Oh, 'cause I can't stop. My friends can stop, you know? They can get off their diet, get back on their diet like nothing happened. Oh, if I have secret pizza? Shit, the next thing I know, I'm in the parking lot of a Wendy's sucking a dick for a Baconator. And I don't even really have to do that. They are very affordable. You guys are fun. This has been a real positive weight loss journey. There's been a lot of positive side effects I never even thought about. I have a lot more energy. No longer afraid of any seat belts on a regional airplane. I had sex standing up! I didn't even know that was for real! I thought that was movie magic my whole life. I thought somebody else was holding her from behind with, like, fishing wire or something. You got a good imagination! Now sometimes people seek me out, ask me questions about health and fitness, which is weird to me. They'll just come up to me on the street, and they'll just be like, hey, Ron, look, man, look. I don't mean to bother you. I'ma let you know I always thought you were pretty funny. But now that you lost this weight, man, you're actually a real inspiration to me. And I'm like, aww! Go fuck yourself. This was never about you. I just think that's rude, you know? Okay, now, all of a sudden, you think you can just do it? Because I did it with my hard work? And discipline? And chewing up gummy bears but then spitting 'em out into the trash? That's harder than just not eating them in the first place. That's dancing with the devil. I remember when I was first losing a little bit of weight, I was really struggling with it. Went to this party. Soon as I walked in the door, nice lady comes up to me. She's just like, hey, Ron. Look, I know you just got to this party. I know you working on your health. Very proud of you. But you have got to... Try... These... brownies. Mm-hmm. Oh, they are the best brownies I have ever... And before this lady could finish that sentence, some other dude just pops up out of nowhere. And he's just like, Uh-uh. Oh, don't you offer Ron no brownies. Oh, I think he's had enough brownies... in his life. Aww, thank you for being on my side. Except for you. You were chuckling. Fuck you. Who put you in charge of my brownie consumption? And first of all, to tell you guys the complete and honest truth, I don't even like brownies. I'm a savory nigga. Always have been. Oh, you gotta come at me with a shepherd's pie or something. Okay! My man! I did not think you were the target demographic for that. You're like, Okay, now, this is some material I can relate to. This is a good comedy special! Why every comedy special I watch, they just want to talk about politics or religion? When a motherfucker gonna come through with that hard-hittin' shepherd's pie material? Streets are begging for it. Tell you guys a great thing about losing a little bit of weight and recently gaining a little bit of money... is that it's also helped me gain a whole lot of confidence. Like, I don't even personally care if you're enjoying this show this evening. I'm sure Comedy Central cares. But not me, I know what I'm about. I know who I am. I like what I do. If you do, great. If you don't, fuck you. And I like having that confidence. It's new for me. When I was younger, more impressionable, I didn't have that type of confidence. I was a real people pleaser. Hang out with just about anybody. Sometimes some real undesirables. Just to be liked, you know, felt like I had a place I belonged. Even if they didn't really care about me. Now there's just certain people I have no time for. Like if you're sexist. Or homophobic. Or if you don't believe in conspiracy theories. I just don't understand how do you not believe in any conspiracy theories? I understand not all of 'em, not most of 'em, but you don't believe in any conspiracy theories? You just think the government's just battin' a thousand at telling us the whole truth? That's a strong stance to take. Again, as I said before, I don't like talking about politics on stage or off stage. 'Cause I don't like talking about things I don't feel like I'm truly knowledgeable in. But I do know this. A government is placed in charge of all of its people. I'm a father who's been placed in charge of just one son. And I lie to that nigga all the time. Thank you for supporting that? How do you not believe in any conspiracy theories? You don't believe in aliens? You're no fun. You don't believe in Russia? That's a real place. Okay, okay, so you telling me that you don't believe that every time Apple makes a new iPhone, they also create an operating system that fucks up your old iPhone? Now we got some true believers. You guys should subscribe to my newsletter, "Funchespiracies." 'Cause that is true, I don't know if you know that. I didn't know it when I wrote the joke. I wrote the joke about nine months ago. I was trying to write it on my iPhone, but it wouldn't update. Then about a month ago, I get on Twitter, and I see in the news section, it says, "Apple admits they slow down older iPhone models on purpose." And I was like, oh, shit! I did it! They heard about me telling these jokes all over the country, and they were like, we can't handle this pressure. We gotta come clean. I felt so powerful! I was like, Ooh, I took 'em down! Ooh, this must be what Hannibal felt like when he took down Bill Cosby. I did not think they would approve that joke. I just love conspiracy theories. I have my whole life. I make some up when I'm bored. Why is it that every time you're getting ready to take off on an airplane, and the captain come on over the loudspeaker, you always hear the same exact thing? You always hear, thank you for choosing us. We know you have a lot of choices in the airline community, and they all fucking suck, so thank you. We got a great crew on board for you this evening. Barbara's here. Oh, you gonna love you some Barbara. We even got pretty good weather conditions. So I'm gonna do my best to get us in a few minutes early so that we can just sit on the runway for another half an hour. So just sit back and relax. Enjoy yourself. Oh, but hold up. If you don't turn off your phone... Oh, I swear to God.. On the lives of Barbara's... beautiful children... This plane will fall from the sky. But now they're just like, oh, never mind. I guess I had just read too many "Goosebumps"' novels late last night. I scared myself. I should know better. If it gets past 10:00, I always tell myself I gotta switch to "Wishbone," you know? That's one of my favorite jokes. For the past two years I've done it, almost every night, twice a night, it's worked about 10% of the time. But I knew from day one it was going in my comedy special. And I'll tell you why. Number one, I like the joke. Number two, I'm just confident in my abilities to sell it. Number three, I fucking love "Wishbone." And if you are not familiar with "Wishbone," oh, let me alleviate your ignorance right now. "Wishbone" is an American educational book/television series about a dog that could read better than you or I. And he uses those comprehension skills to somehow travel throughout time where he wears period-appropriate costumes... Like sometimes he'll be Queen Elizabeth, in a little gown and veil and look quite fetching, and that's a fun dog joke to make even if you don't know "Wishbone." But other times, he'll be, like, Sherlock Holmes with a little cap and magnifying glass. And I'm like, how the fuck are you even holding that, Wishbone? You ain't got no thumbs. I was willing to believe you could read and time travel, but this... This is too far. If you know me at all, you might be aware I'm the father of a 15-year-old son named Malcolm who has autism. If you have anyone with autism in your life, congratulations, you've been trusted to take care of a beautiful soul. And a lot of people ask me what it's like to raise a child with autism, which is very difficult to describe. It's a large spectrum. It means a lot of things. I can only tell you how it affects my son in particular. It means he gets overstimulated very easily. He prefer if he wear little earplugs and earmuffs when he's out in public. He has little texture issues. He doesn't want to touch or eat certain things ever. He has little vocabulary issues as well. Again, he's 15. He can take in everything you're saying to him. He's a very bright, bright boy, but he speaks in mostly, like, little catchphrases, like, uh, "Take that," or, uh, "Eat shit, Daddy." And I'm like, oh, that's the autism talking. He's tough to discipline, you know? And our relationship's changing a lot. He's getting older. He's a teenager. It's a lot less like I'm even raising a child, teaching him what's right and wrong. Now it's more like I'm roommates with this tiny drag queen. Oh, he's a sassy little bitch. I'd like to tell a story to prove the point. I travel a lot for this job, whenever my son's schedule allows him to, I like to bring him with me, 'cause I miss him. When he does come with me, I try to keep the same routine, 'cause he needs structure. We check into the hotel, I order a cheese pizza with extra sauce, then he just eats it all by himself. Just living a total "Home Alone 2" type of lifestyle. Oh, I encourage it. That's my favorite of the "Home Alones." The last time we went out, he wanted to eat his cheese pizza, extra sauce, all by himself with no pants on. No underwear on. Just totally Winnie-the-Pooh-ing it. Which is not as cute when you actually have genitals, trust me. Like, nobody wants to see your Hundred Acre Woods, man. So I asked my son, I'm like, hey, man, um... Look. I don't mind if you want to eat this whole cheese pizza, extra sauce, by yourself. Sounds like a beautiful evening. But do you mind... maybe... putting some pants on? You're making me just a little uncomfortable. I mean, hell, you're making my friend Gabe very uncomfortable. I forgot to mention Gabe was there for that. And his eyes were dartin' all over the fucking place. Which means he's a good friend. I thank him for not looking at my son's penis directly in the eye. I go to my son, I say, hey... can you put some pants on? And my only child, the person I love more than anything else in this world, I would do anything for, and he's made me prove it time and time again... He just says back to me, Mm... Nah. I was like, what the fuck is this? What did I do wrong? Oh, okay, I think I got it, I got it. I always talked to you to about manners and being polite. Right there, I was not. So I'm gonna try once more. Would you mind putting your pants on... please? And he says... Mm... Nah. And I was like, okay, I guess I'm just gonna have to fuck you up, then. 'Cause your whole life, I thought we had this father-son dynamic, but I guess all of a sudden, we just two grown men talking. And one of us ain't wearing pants. But I was like, let me calm down. We can compromise, you know? You don't want to wear your pants? Okay. The least you can do is wear your underwear. And he says... Mm... You go get 'em, bitch. Calm down, Jerry Springer audience. He didn't really say "bitch." But it was totally implied. So I go and get his underwear. I've lost this battle. He goes to get his next slice of hot cheese pizza. Extra sauce. And then Jesus takes the wheel. Oh, he's just leaning back... With a slice of hot cheese pizza. Extra sauce. With all the unearned confidence that reminds me that he's half-white. I like that you like that joke. And I love that you accept that stereotype. You guys are like, well, that's just true. White people be eating pizza confidently like a motherfucker. So he's leaning back. He goes to take a bite. Half of the cheese and sauce slides off. - Oh! - Don't get ahead of me. And it plummets. And it lands... directly... on his nuts. Oh, I loved it! I know I'm just telling you guys, but I can still see it up here. He's just running around going, hot nuts, Daddy! Hot nuts! And I had to be a good father and pretend like I was concerned for his well-being. I had to be like, aww! Oh, no! Oh, did my boy's nuts get too hot? Aww! And if you wouldn't blow on your son's hot nuts, you not a good parent. I did not want to do that. What I wanted to do was be like, that's what you get, you saucy bitch! And that's how he got his drag queen name, Saucy Bitch. Check him out. "Drag Race All-Stars." I love being a single dad. I'm just not looking for a relationship right now. I'm open to one. And I love couple activities. I think everything's more fun when you got somebody to talk shit with. That's my favorite part of being in a relationship, just showing up someplace together, just being like, oh... Oh, shit, girl. Everybody else here sucks, but us. Ooh, girl, we gonna talk so much shit. Oh, everybody here is so stupid. I don't know why we keeping coming to my family reunions. That's just classic comedy. I just love couple activities, like just getting real high together and getting mani-pedis done. Yeah. You guys doing that out here? If not, you better start, or I'm gonna take all your bitches. You gotta get stoned mani-pedis with your girl. First, you get real high, and then you got these Korean slaves that clean your feet for you. I know that's not a nice thing to say. But that's what makes it fun when I go. I role-play. I'm like, I'm the king. I don't understand your words. Sing your slave songs elsewhere! My favorite couple activity is as simple as just laying in bed together, listening to music. Doing some bed dancing. Just trying to recreate Jay-Z/Beyoncé videos. And I sing the Beyoncé part. And she does the Jay-Z rap. And every time Jay-Z says the N-word, I say it for her 'cause she's probably a white girl. Ah, so fun. Your reaction was exactly like I thought it would be without looking at you. Let me explain myself. I don't want to sound prejudiced at all. I think all women are beautiful, wonderful creatures. I think black women especially so, and I don't want to add to this thing, I don't know if you guys are aware of, but there is a history in Hollywood of trying to make black women feel less wanted, less attractive, less sexually desirable. I don't ever want to add to that. I don't think that's the case. But I want to be true to myself. I grew up in the south side of Chicago, which is a very rough area. I'm not a tough person. And a lot of women I was going after, especially a lot of the black women, they like the tougher type of black dudes. That's what they saw, you know? That's what the media showed you, you know? There's only, like, one or two types of black dudes they try to show you, and there's so many different types, you know? But they only like to show you a couple, you know, like "thug" or "dead." And that's not cool. There's so many different types of black people. There's so many different types of any type of people. There's just so many different types of black dudes in general. There's, like, basketball niggas, there's "Dragon Ball" niggas. I'm a proud "Dragon Ball" nigga. It's just who I am, and sometimes that didn't work with the women I was going after, you know? They wanted more of a tough, strong, dominant black man. So many of 'em were like that to the point I just started pretending like I was that, you know, if they didn't know me, if they didn't know who I was, if they didn't know I was a Care Bear cousin inside. But eventually, they figure it out, and they'd be like, Look, Ron, I'm sorry. You're a good guy. And that's the problem. I'm looking for a tough, strong, dominant black man to help take care of me. And I'd be like, Well, quite frankly... So am I. You don't think I want to ride on The Rock's shoulders? Eating an ice cream cone? Girl, do you even look at my vision board? Oh, it's fun to say, but it's more fun to imagine. Like The Rock's just carrying me on the beach on the sand. But he's not even wobbling 'cause his quads are so strong. And I'm like, are you okay, The Rock? He's like, Oh, I got you, little buddy, and I'm like, he called me little! I'm gonna eat more ice cream! That's my favorite person. I mean, sometimes my son is, but not usually. But I always love The Rock. He's amazing. He's done so many great things. The Rock is a surefire WWE Hall of Famer. He's the greatest actor of our generation. I was like, why the fuck were you laughing? He's hopefully the next President of the United States of America. He's Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The Beyoncé for boys. Oh, The Rock is perfect. He can do no wrong in my eyes. The Rock? Oh, The Rock could murder my whole family. And I would just assume they did something to deserve it. 'Cause The Rock's not doing that willy-nilly. Not The Rock I know. Not "Escape From Witch Mountain" The Rock. That's an underrated classic. If I was out on a date with a lady, and we were all cuddled up together, which sometimes happens. And then The Rock saw us, and he was like, oh. You guys make a cute couple. But not anymore. 'Cause I want to fuck her. I'd be like, well, sir! I'ma check with her first. Oh, but on this end, there are no issues. I mean, if The Rock was hitting on me, if his muscular finger went against the nape of my neck, oh... I mean, I like to think I'm straight, but in this case, you know, who really knows? Maybe I am a Rock bottom. I don't know. Look, all I really know is, if The Rock was hitting on me, I'd just be like, uh... I'ma have to see where he's going with this. But I think I smell what The Rock is cooking. Smell that dick. That's fun to say! Smell The Rock's dick! Glad you guys like that. My mom hates that joke. Not The Rocks dick part of the joke. She actually likes that part of it. She keeps trying to get me to add more to it. She's like, talk about the veins. Talk about the veins. My mom doesn't hate The Rock's dick part of that joke. She hates the dating white ladies part. Uh-- Much like you seem to. Uh-- And that's fine. That's a perspective. You know, it's just that my mom would prefer if I were to settle down with a full-black lady, give her some nice full-black grandbabies, 'cause my mom's "a racist." And it's fun to say that out loud. And it's just true. My mom's a little racist. She's a little homophobic. My mom's like an old-timey Southern conservative white man... That somehow got trapped... In a poor black lady's body. Just like the best episode of "Quantum Leap" ever. Okay! Okay, you guys are cool. You like shepherd's pie jokes. "Quantum Leap" references way past their expiration. I just try not to judge my mom, you know? I just love my mom to death, and... you know, she's a little racist. It's okay, a lot of older people are. She doesn't make laws or anything. It's just that my mom grew up in a different time, you know? My mom grew up in a time when racism was very prevalent in America, not like today. Oh, what have you heard? Well, my mom grew up in a time where racism was more in-your-face. Everybody was doing it, and nobody knew why. It was like Pogs. Ha. That's a weird joke. If you got it, or if you didn't get it, you're right. It's a weird joke to put at the end of your entire set. After you've earned everybody's trust. But I think it's one of the best jokes that sums up my entire act, if not my life. Well, I know, like, half the people around me are like, "I don't know what the fuck this nigga's talking about." But there's always, like, one cool dude in the back who's like, I got a slammer in my pocket right now. Seattle, thank you so much!
