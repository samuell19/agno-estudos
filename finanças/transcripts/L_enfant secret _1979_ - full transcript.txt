Long live Anarchy! THE SECRET CHILD - - THE CAESAREAN SECTION - Your heart is racing! Are you OK? Yes. What's your name? Jean-Baptiste. And your name? Elie. Close the door for a moment, I have to talk to Jean-Baptiste. What are you doing? Go, she's waiting for you! When are you leaving? Don't worry about me! Go, go! You know... I have a child. A boy, his name is Swann. His father didn?t want to acknowledge him, so he's carrying my name. When he was born... His father had to come to see him at the Clinic... He was an actor and he was shooting a movie that was almost over... He didn't come. So... A few days after that I went to see him on the set. I had the baby with me. I talked to him for about 2 minutes between two scenes And he told me he'll acknowledge the baby. And afterwards I never saw him again. Who takes care of the baby? His grandmother. Not my mother, his mother. Because... I don't have any money and I travel a lot. Do you think it's not ethical? I don?t know. I don't have any children. If I'd go looking for him now would you wait for me? It's not far away, it's in the suburbs, only an hour by train. Would you wait if I'd go? I would like you to meet him. You know he is... ...very beautiful... ...very funny... even better than that, I'm sure you will be friends. You're proud... Yes! He's... The man of my life, as people say. Will you wait for me? An hour is not that long... OK. You'll stay here? Yes. - THE SECRET CHILD - Come in! This is Swann, this is Jean-Baptiste. Hello. You know what I was thinking last night before going to sleep? Let's go. I'll tell you later. Are we going to sleep? No, it's long, isn't it? Do you love me? Tell me. I can't do that with Swann. I love you. Mom, let's see the buddies... A little wolf A little chicken A little cat? No. it's not a little cat, it's a camel. -A camel? -Oui. Well I... I promised that I'll take him back by 17:00. Don't take me back... Oh yes, I will. -No! -Yes No! Come on, Swann... There... I told him he told me... What? Back there he called me charming. charming... Who, you? Wait, wait. I have to go, do you understand? I'll come with you. What about your film? It's not important. You'll come later. Tell me that you love me. Are you crying? That doesn't work. - THE LAST WARRIOR - The loneliness of directing... Directing the loneliness... Hello, can I entertain you? It's 100 francs for me and 50 for the room. Do you live here? No, I work here. I live with my little daughter. I won't have children, I prefer the revolution. Your generation is lost in moral filth. Wait, I have a photo of my little daughter. Well then? Won't you go upstairs? Verginie... Hello Jean Baptiste It's past midnight. we are on the road We'll be back tomorrow morning. I love you, Ellie. My friend is sad because her husband won't forgive her for something she did. She's my room-mate for now. You know I don't like to share a room, I do it only with you and my Swann. And during this she keeps me company. I love you, Your Ellie. Hang in... Is there anybody? Is there anybody? Hello... What happened to you? What's the matter? The doctor called me, I came here right away. Everybody was anxious, we didn't know what happened... Do you need anything? Do you want me to bring you anything? Talk to me... You should have come home. I... I have to tell you I think he took too much LSD. Good bye. - THE OPHIDIAN CIRCLE - What's the matter Jean-Baptiste? Why do you allow the demons to take over? They're not bad for the walk in the yard. Are you afraid? If you want to go upstairs the room is ready. Do you know where Jean-Baptiste is? He is in the waiting room. Jean-Baptiste? This time I was beginning to regain my memory Memories came back from the void... my name, the film that I was working on. But I always lose some pieces after another electric shock. Surpassing those holes was the most painful part of the hospital time. I had to make huge efforts to regain my identity, my past.. but also for accepting myself. I kept losing ground after each intervention. A little music for you, Jean-Baptiste! Hello Jean-Baptiste! You have a nice room. Why are you packing? Are you leaving soon? Jean-Baptiste! It's Ellie. Ah, you're here. Are you OK? I have to talk to you. Tell me. No, not now. Later. You know, I didn't find the sealing wax. I found all the rest. I've searched for it everywhere. I invite you to leave. What did you want to tell me? I'm sure they are putting him through electric shocks. No! Didn't you see the scars on his temples? Are you sure? Yes, I know. Are you sure, really? Yes. Your friends are nice. Look, it's Ellie. What are you doing? Because there was him Because there was me Lower your head! Cut! I have to kiss you now. Jean-Baptiste... Yes. You know, I'll be with you for the rest of my life now. Ellie! What's the matter? My mother is dead. I didn't see anybody. What shall I become? Mother... Mother... Mother... I promised I'd go to see her. I would have if I wouldn't have worked on your film. Maybe things would have been different... I promised her. We would have gone for a walk She was afraid all the time. She told me that there was somebody following her all the time. that people were looking at her people were turning their heads after her And that she wouldn't get out of the hospital that she preferred staying in the hospital. Jean-Baptiste! You face is like lace. You are beautiful. What are you doing? I'm sending Swann a postcard. Would you read it? "My dear, I did not leave for London yet Your granny tells me you're happy. We'll go there just the two of us this winter if your granny would accept. You've never seen such a beautiful place. But you really have to keep your hair as it is. It's very important for the film that we'll continue making. Your mom." "Who loves you..." Do thoughts, looks, words of love and secrets keep their value if we disclose them in front of other people, like this? I feel like abandoning everything! It's like I'm exiled in myself. I want to walk over there! No, it's dangerous Swann! You know, last night I had a dream about you. It was very funny. You were making a film and I was acting in it. I was holding a thing in my hand With a flame that kept fading. And I was saying... I was saying: "Look, there won't be any fire until next year!" What did I do? Why won't you tell me? Only a little... Come on... Kiss me... Let's go to take Swann. What's the matter? Nothing. Tell me, what did I do? Did I say anything? It's nothing then. You don't love me anymore. I use to travel all the time. Now you want me to stay with you. You love that guy that I've seen the other day. You go to his place every afternoon. Jean-Baptiste, don't be jealous! "There are too many dreams, too many distractions. We have to be focused. We have to be disciplined, live regularly And have symmetric thoughts A summary of all these thoughts... The night isn't very powerful Fighting with my best friend over things that I can't change right now. Challenging my mind with things that I already need so that I become confused and leave anything else to the daytime to solve. The financial part of all this is very serious business. Please, don't be too angry." Hey! It's drugs, isn?t it? Would you want me to call the police? Calm down. Ellie... Come in. Don't touch me. I came to get my white dress. Ellie... And the other one... I didn't give a damn she sleeps with others. But this bastard wanted to take her away. Chloe... I'll tell you a secret. I'm not doing well right now. It's a little bit... But promise me you won't tell anybody Only you and I should know. No, I have to go! - THE DISENCHANTED FORRESTS - It's like the interior exile, you know? Or like when we see each other while being separated. I don't know really. Did you eat anything today, Jean-Baptiste? I'll make a film. I wrote the story, I'll tell you about it. A couple exit a city, walking They cross the suburbs and keep walking, and walking... ... in the evening they arrive..... Did you sleep? Wait, I'll continue the story. They follow that star And go into the forest, a very black forest They walk for a long time and arrive Just below the star, at a tiny home. The go inside to sleep. In the morning she goes out She goes to gather some wood He goes out too He sees a cart leaning against a wall He begins to dig You'll act in this film... No. They go to sleep... And after that they sink into eternity. I'm sorry but I have to go now. I told Andreas I'd go back earlier. I heard that French people din not trust their own things. I felt guilty about my money I was ashamed of my social standing. I loved a woman, I had a friend Love exists, it crushes the wall of solitude Being faithful is just a movement of the soul Bastards! Yes. Jean-Baptiste? Yes. Come quickly, I'm very sick. Where? At the hotel on Glaci?re street. Ok. Come quickly, Jean-Baptiste! Ok. Come in! Gently, I was very sick! My heart's like a stone. What happened? What's with all these stains? I smashed a window. That's bad. You could have changed the sheets. You have to be more careful. Adeline... Shit. What happened? It's nothing, she's a little drunk. Good night. What happened? Who are you? It's me, Jean-Baptiste! What's the matter? Jean-Baptiste... What are you doing? Nothing! Won't you go to see Swann? I decided not to go there anymore. It's been three Sundays already... I was only saying... Isn't it serious? What if we took him to live with us? Never! Swann told me That he didn't like me hanging out with guys like you. Haven't I told you that? He's jealous, he doesn't want me to take away his mother. I haven't thought about that. Do you believe me? Certainly. Swann doesn't love me anymore, I've already told you. The last two days I was so sad that I... ...I cried for hours and hours. I have to go to meet someone now. Who? I'll tell you later, it's not... It's nothing serious, I'll come back quickly. Will you wait for me? Yes. Do you feel cold? What happened? Nothing. Nothing. Are you sure? Well, will you pay... What is it? Do you take this stuff? Don't be angry, Jean-Baptiste Don't preach morals to me. Don't preach morals to me. Don't do it, Jean-Baptiste! It's good, you know... Do you want to take some with me? Don't leave me, Jean-Baptiste! Don't abandon me... Don't leave me now... Don't leave me, Jean-Baptiste!
