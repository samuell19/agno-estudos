You'd like to eat me, huh? My balls, my ass and the rest. You don't like blacks, huh? You're more racist than your boss. I don't want a shot, Doc. It hurts. Less than a dog bite. Or an infection. I felt nothing, Doc. You're a chief! That's it. - The fence was three meters high. They look like dogs but they behave like leopards. Let's say one meter fifty. That's pretty good. That's for you. - Thanks, Doc. Now you'll have to rest. Higher, higher... There you are. And I'll take those stitches in five or six days. Good bye, Doc. Thanks. Congrats on the bandage. - I'm used to it. With all the accidents in this city. Really? You'll see. See you tomorrow, Doctor. See you tomorrow. Hello? - Hello, Dr Ferret? Yes. - I'm Police Captain Laborde. Could you come immediately 23 Paul Verlaine St? It's about a rape. - Okay. I'm coming. Good evening Doctor. She's in her room. I'm leaving you. Can I have your statement by tomorrow morning? - Of course, Captain. You know how it happened? Not really. She's going to tell you. I should have got one. I should have got one. - One what? Like the others. What are they doing? - It's always like that when there's trouble. They patrol all night long with their dogs. It makes them feel safe. They're so bored. It distracts them. Martini on the rocks? Cheers, Doctor. To your first rape! How do you know? Words travel fast here. It's not the first time you come for your insomnia. No, it's not. But it gets worse. I used to go and walk in the street when I couldn't sleep but now with all the trouble I have to stay in bed. If only I could go to the movies. But they only have porno in theatres here. There's nothing to do in the evening. So I work all day half asleep. A stupid job, pushing levers forward, backward, forward, backward all day long. That's it. It's a bite? - It's nothing, Doctor. You'll take this every evening before sleep. One phial. Thank you, Doctor. Another bite. Do you think it's normal? Here. That's the file you asked me. Ah, Doctor, how are you? Follow me, please. You got in touch with our workers but not with our working conditions. As you know it's one of the most important plastics factory in Europe. We did our best for the comfort and well being of our employees. The physical and mental hygiene conditions are ideal. Raw material is almost free. We sell the finish product. All proceeds are for us. Besides, this finish product comes back to us as raw material. In a way, you have invented the perpetual motion. How are you, Keita? - Fine, chief. Still deep in the shit! Doctor, you're pulling my funny leg! That's it. Well, you can put it back. Tell me more about your insomnia, Mrs. In fact it's when I try to sleep that I cannot sleep. I see. And do you wake up in the middle of the night? Yes, when I sleep. But it's not every day. How long since you have this nervousness? - Well, since childhood. But it gets worse. You see a particular reason? My husband, who is a janitor at the City Hall, is a man... Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. No, I mean, he's like all men. But it's not him who keeps me up all night, it's his dog. He sleeps with you. - No... but he became very mean. My husband trains him to be like this. And my husband is changing too, he becomes like his dog. He's aggressive, always looking for trouble and barking at people. I'm afraid, Doctor. There will be an accident sooner or later. He should sell him. - My husband? Selling his dog? He would rather sell me. My dog is like a child to me. Mine was coughing so much that I thought about a whooping couch but luckily he got better. You're lucky. Mine broke one of his legs. I'm sure he was hit by a car. We should get rid of these damn cars, Miss. This nasty bunch of punks again. Black people used to hassle us. And now that we got them off our tail those punks are taking over. They also rape their professors. They're capable of anything! Speed up and don't try anything stupid. I told you to speed up! What are you doing? Shut up or I'm pulling out my water pistol. And get in front. You're not in a cab. Come on! Hey, Jacques, let me see your arm. It's a bite, right? It's only one of their dogs. So we do like them. You fight with their dogs? - Yeah, but we have rules. We're entitled to an elbow pad and a padded jacket. That's all. Some guys took cudgels but Frank fired them. Look! Frank has tons of scratches. At the third one I'll be a member of the club! The club of the bitten! Dodging is our secret weapon. Look! Attack! Attack! Come on! Frank has defeated Lilith once. Lilith? Satan's wife? - It's Morel's best dog. A she-dog. She can throw a guy down just by jumping on him. I got him! Jacques, look! I got him! I got him! Me too, I got him! I'm sure it was not a black man. Apart from the stocking on his face, what did he look like? A young man, probably. He was wearing blue jean trousers, a jacket and pointy boots. I saw them. Why all these questions? You'll never been able to arrest him anyway. Come here, Lilith! Come. Quiet, quiet. Come here, Lilith. That's good. Good morning, Miss Barrault. Good morning, Mr. Morel. Excuse them. They're not mean. They're well educated. - They're trained, Miss. Trained. But it's the same thing, isn't it? - No, not quite. So you really don't want to get one? No. Excuse me. Ah! Look... He has already adopted you. Good bye. Good bye. Heel, Lea. That's good. It's terrible, you can't get out at night without being raped. Rape is only an example. Homes are vandalized, people are beaten just for fun. It's like in America. What do you mean "like in America"? Here we do much better. One night, Doctor, they smashed my friend's jewelery with a bulldozer. And they simply took the safe. People thought there was construction. I hope Elizabeth has learned her lesson now. She used to say she couldn't stand people responding to violence with violence. What do you want the police to do? We can't have cops everywhere permanently. We're lucky to have Morel. I'm listening to you but I'm afraid of what I hear. The cure is worse than the disease. If one walks at night, he's caught between dogs and prowlers and is quickly mistaken for a prowler by people patroling with their dogs. Even though there are quite a few blunders, Mr Mayor, this is not a reason to give up. As a Doctor, I was very surprised by the number of bites that I had to heal in such a short time. There's no mean dogs, there's only bad owners. In any case, as long as I'm here, I will not yield to Morel's rule. Dogs rule. You didn't always say that. I say it now! At the moment, you're my only my assistant. You won't stop me from making orders where necessary. You heard them. You saw them. Fanatics! They're fanatics! All of them! They want to get rid of me but I won't be frightened by them. Whatever Morel do, I'll get the ban on dogs in this city. And If I get the axe, he'll get it first. Follow me. Here. Look what they're planning. My report is ready to go to the prefecture. Could you make a medical report to support it? Certainly. Be reassured. We're not alone. A few friends are supporting me. The pharmacist for instance. Montagnac? - Yes. He's tired of all this. Others too. But we have dangerous people in front of us. Take my assistant. It's not enough for him to manage the supermaket. He watches out for my place like a jackal. Dr Lombard started this file a year ago, at the opening of the plant. He's living in Paris now. Yes, I know. I come from Paris and I wonder if I wouldn't have been better off staying there. Bites. Only bites. I have to put together a report for the mayor. Mr. Bourceau, our mayor, has been acting strangely lately. People find him a little unbalanced. But I'm not a psychiatrist after all. Hello, Dr Ferret? In forty eight hours? Very well. As soon as I have your report I'll send the complete file to the prefecture. Thank you and good night. If I had known I would have locked him up. Rex is not a mean dog. - Well, he proved it. I give you two days to have your dog put down. Captain, I'm afraid that this was not an accident. This dog was thrown at him. Come on, Doctor, you're imagining things! - I only rely on facts. He called me five minutes before about a file on which we work together in order to ban dogs in town. Listen, Ferret, the mayor was paranoiac. Everyone knew that. Except me. And yet I am a doctor. - Alright, we'll investigate. But I doubt that we get some evidence to support your accusation. This is a terrible accident. That's all. If you want us to accept you in our community, I advise you to be a little less impressionable. Impressionable or not, I'll pursue the mayor's work. And I'll add to his file. We'll see how the metropolitan police department will react. You're coming, Beauchamp? Well, Mrs Colin, the accident you had predicted finally happened. Predicted? I predicted something? You told me that your husband was becoming as mean as his dog, didn't you? I never said that. No way! Rex is not a mean dog. Of course, he's a nice doggie. A nice doggie who slaughters people. Is there a chance that you say to the Captain that your husband had changed? - Surely not. Colin is always the same. A little rough, that's all. Are you a Doctor or an Inspector? I'm a Doctor. Be reassured. Down! What is this about, Mr? I'd like to see Mr. Morel please. I'm Doctor Ferret. Wait here, please. Mr. Morel, Dr Ferret would like to see you. Okay, go get the Doberman. Come on, jump there! Please, I don't want to see his head ahead of your knee. Hold him tight! That's it. Attack! Go ahead! Come on! - Only the legs, Colin! Never above the legs. Never. You hear me? I don't run a school of killers. Call back your dog! Come on! Heel! Come on, another time. Attack! That's better, much better. The legs! Attack the legs! I'm warning you. If you don't make progress quickly I'll have to take back the dog from you. Hello, Doctor. I'm glad to meet you. I heard a lot about you. Really? - We work a little in the same line, don't you think? Is that so? - Well, I mean that we try, each in our own way, to channel the violence, to contain it. That's also what the Mayor tried to do. That's what he died for. - Yes, I know. Alas... That's precisely against that kind of accidents that I fight with all my strength but what do you want... People come to see me when they're traumatized or feel helpless. I cannot refuse them the protection they ask from me. There's too many accidents, Mr. Morel. The mayor had put up a file but unfortunately... I've decided to take over from him. Very well. You're right. Let's hope the result of this will bring more security and well-being in our city. Yes, let's hope. Look. It's great, my boy! Come here, darling! You see, there's no mean dog. Only bad owners. I teach them to get better. Thank you. Can I see you a moment, Doctor? - Yes. This way. Tell me. It wasn't an accident, right? Well, let's say that this is food for thought. I find this suspicious. Now the way is clear for Morel with the help of the mayor's assistant. Froment, the manager of the supermaket? Morel will be elected mayor if we don't react. What do you suggest? We are a few who refuse to be manipulated. We'll provoke the resignation of the municipal council and set up an opposition party. Will we be able to count on you? Of course. I'm sure it was him. He probably recognized me and turned his back on me to prevent me from seeing his face. How can you be so sure? - For what other reason he would dig into stockings? Maybe his wife gave him her size because she didn't have time to buy them herself. But I recognized his figure, his hands! He's going to put that stocking on his face again. He'll do it again, maybe this night. Come on, Elisabeth. Calm down. Let's have dinner together. You'll be safe with me. I knew him well. He was a nice guy. But he was behaving strangely lately. You think he was paranoid? No. He simply had changed. Me too, I feel different. What do you mean? The fear, the anguish. I had always kept them at bay. But now, after what happened to the mayor... And to me... You must forget everything. I can't. I am contaminated now. I've become like all the others. It can't be. They're too ugly. Let's have a drink in another place, okay? I'm sorry, sir. Good evening, my friends! At least you two are not afraid of going out at night. What a disgrace, really! There. What do you want to drink? Scotch. Same for me. - Right away. Wanna dance? No thanks. You think I don't look good enough for you? She finds you gorgeous, sir, but she's not dancing, that's all. You're looking for trouble? Leave us alone now. Alone! Come on, don't be an ass. Forget it. Forget it. - Are you guys crazy or what? Here. For our drinks. I see lights behind us. I'm sure we're being followed. There's always lights, you know. We're not the only ones to drive. Well, good night. - Good night. Thank you. You managed to get a laugh out of me. They've been arrested this morning. They are repeat offenders. They're stock-car specialists. But this time they'll stay in jail for at least six months. And back at it as soon as they're out. Now you understand Doctor why people get some dogs. Of course, it makes sense, they get dogs to stop cars. Yes, I changed my mind. It's better this way. His name is Lea. I came by to check up on you. I'm fine, I didn't break anything. So, Captain, you have something on my attacker? The inquiry is following its course. You talked about a young guy. So we look after young guys. Papers, please. You think I look like a rapist? What do you think, darling? Wait. - No thanks, I've had plenty. What do you mean? You're an excellent cook. I'm sure he won't refuse. Here. That's it. He's friendly, huh? Yeah, sure... Here. - I won't refuse that. When you fell from your horse, the best thing to do... Thanks, that's very kind of you. Something's bothering you? How this accident happened? An idea of my wife. She has strong teeth. - No, it's her dog. It's always the same when I want to get near her. Especially at night. My wife looks great. Look at her, Doctor. Yes, indeed. I can't get near her since a month. I can't get in her bed. Did you try a muzzle? I mean... on your dog. It's no use. That's it. - Thanks. You don't know them, Doctor, but you need to be cautious. They're watching you. Who's watching me? - Morel and his bunch. My wife doesn't make love but she speaks. She speaks a lot. She's at Morel's every day. You're too kind with everyone. They don't like that. - Too bad for them. Above all, don't try to stand up to them. When you attack them, they bite. Ask the blacks. They learned their lesson, they're not that dumb. Good bye. Let's move! You too, but slowly. More, more, more! More! Throw them! Attack! Come on! Not on the same guy, morons! No, not the arms! Ankles, calfs, thighs and the back. Turn around them! With some teeth! With some teeth! Good, that's good. Take back your dog now and congratulate him. Do that, they deserve it. And give them some water. You're gifted. That's good, very good. Lea, heel! That's good. That's good. Here. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Come on, Lea! Hop! That's great. Don't move! Your turn now. Lea, hop! Very well! Very well! Pat him, pat him. You must always pat him after work. That's good. It encourages him. That's very good. You know, You're really very gifted. A few more lessons and you'll easily get your second degree. But be careful. Now is the time to start creating a bond with him. You must learn to read his thoughts and his feelings from his face. From his body position. How? It's up to you to find it. But you'll see... Lea will teach you a lot of things on yourself. You're selling to these punks too? - It's business first, Mrs. Attack! Come on, attack, my dog! Look. Look at him. Look at the lines on his front. They're heading to this point here above his eyes. Look at his eyes and the corner of his mouth. He doesn't look happy. Something's bothering him. It's probably me. He certainly understands a lot more than we think. Hello? Hang on a moment please. Hello? - Hello. It's Jacques. Do you know the gas station on Goethe Avenue? Yes. Can you meet me there in ten minutes? It's urgent. Okay. They may follow us. Let's take our precautions. Turn right. Turn left. Are you sure we can count on him? - Yes, Frank. I assure you. When will you stop your bullshit? We're not like the blacks. We're not gonna let them. You're only playing in their hands. We didn't start that. It's up to them to stop first. This one has a few black asses on his conscience. We're just scaring him a little before releasing him. It will be a real surprise for them. Maybe they will let us down a little after that. How is your patient, Doctor? Professional secrecy. You should be more careful. These guys are dangerous. Quiet. Don't move, my dog. Shut up, shut up! He didn't forget his first owner. You mean it's the mayor's dog? - Yes. I didn't know he had a dog. He even became quite fanatical with his training. Well, that was before. Before? Before what? Before he suddenly dropped out everything. Everything, the dog, the training. Do you know the reason? You should ask Morel. They had a feud. And suddenly the mayor tried everything he could to put a spoke in his wheel. We call this custody of the goods. When a good dog has learned, it's over. No-one can get close to it. He'd rather get killed on the spot. Come on, Lea! Attack! That's good! That's good! Lea, heel! Heel! Lea, heel! Lea, come here! That's good. Sit down. That's good! Not bad. Not bad at all. A great start indeed. But you must scream louder when you give the order. And be sharper. It's your voice that carries him. That makes you the owner. Move out of the way. Lea, attack! Attack! That's a good dog! Now call him back. Lea! Heel! Lea! Attack! Yes! Yes! Come on! Bite me! That's good! Encourage him now! That's good, my baby! Come on, bite him! Come on! Encourage him again! Come on! Come on! Bite him! That's good, Elizabeth! That's good! Give him orders! - Bite him! Bite him! Louder! - Bite him! Again! Again! Again! She's really gifted, huh? You sound like you talk about a healer or a clairvoyant. You're wrong to laugh at her. Very soon she'll get her second degree. And then? - Well... She'll train for the third. And will become more perfect. You know, dog training is a school of will. Like martial arts. Let me show you something. Look at them. That's Lilith. My favorite dog. My favorite... See how the bitch is happy... She's happy... You don't stop them? - No. It's only during fight that a dog reveals himself. This one is cruel, aggressive and shows some teeth. That's good. But no sign yet that he has the cloth to be a pack leader. Let's go, Doctor. It is that hierarchy that is for me the foundation of any effective society. But it's the mayor's dog! Yes, he was a fighter but now he's too sentimental. We'll have to sacrifice him. Like his owner? "My dog has been bitten in the leg and" "insurance requires one month of waiting for damages" Etc, etc... I told you so. There's nothing in this file. The mayor talked all day long about his file. But it's empty. Only a few bloody pics. That's all. I heard about a feud between Morel and the mayor. And then they ended their relationship. When was it approximately? You're stubborn, Doctor. Let me think about it... I don't know, maybe three months ago. Nothing special happened at that time? Do you remember something special? - No, I don't see. I remember now. It was at this point that the thefts of the black jugglers stopped. The jugglers? Yep. Two Africans who disassembled cars in record time. Very clever guys. We glimpsed them but we could never get hold of them. Blacks are already not easy to recognize in the day but at night... - Yeah, I know that one. They all look the same. Then they suddenly disappeared. Nothing else happened? Some minor frictions between the population and migrant workers. You know how people are. It's still at that time that peace returned between the two communities. We have compiled a list of fair and liable people who are known for their sense of organization and their dedication to the municipal cause. They all put the common interest above their particular interests whatever they might be. On the other hand, and assuming that dogs provide security of their owners, the City Hall cannot in any case makes a grant to the one who sells them. Indeed, maintaining order is an important task but little by little with the municipality only dedicating itself to these problems forget all the others that are more urgent! It's not too late! Ladies and gentlemen, it has become essential that we find a solution to this situation that became intolerable! Ladies and gentlemen, this is intolerable! Ladies and gentlemen, please! Attack! Attack! Let me go! I swear, he tried to rape me in the parking. But I managed to let the dog out. It's only thanks to him and Mr. Morel that I barely escaped with my life. It's at Mr Morel's that I take training courses. Could you see your attacker's face? A young guy wearing some boots and a jacket. My dog really hurt him, I'm sure of that. I lodged a complaint at the police and the Captain has... Lea. Come, my baby. Come here. That's good, huh? It's all for you. Here's more. It won't do, it won't do at all! You think you know your dogs but you have to feel them. You must live with them. I don't want mean dogs. Move on! You could have been raped at least three times! Come on, come on! I told you, I don't want mean dogs. I want dogs with teeth. To have some teeth is just the other face of sociability. Come on, bite! It won't do at all. Take a cue from Elizabeth and Brigitte for instance. Look at them. Look! It's good, Lea! Attack! Go on! Go on! Come on, bite this bastard! There's a local anesthetic. That's smart. I'll take five packs, please. Alright, five packs of Faryngine. Sorry. Are you crazy? Cotton and alcohol please. Hey, it's not an hospital here! - Enough! I'm the owner, I do as I please! Not for long. I'm sorry, Doctor. You won't be disturbed behind. I got my third bite. I'm in the club now. And you become general at the fifteenth? Dogs will be banned from the city long before that. Tell me, Jacques. Have you heard about two black thieves? Don't worry, it won't hurt. People called them the jugglers. Of course. They were very clever. They were selling stolen cars piece by piece. One of them was Sambe. You should ask your buddy Keita. He knew him very well. When did you get that wound? Saturday night. I had an argument with my girlfriend and she bit me. She could speak some English. Frank, come at the board. Tell me this sentence in negative form. I talked about it last week. You'd better learn your lessons, instead of torturing dogs. You too, Miss... You went to the other side. You become like the others. Get out of this room, Frank. Get out immediately. Get out now! From now on, I'll make appear before a disciplinary board any pupil who will torture a dog. I warned the head teacher who gave me his full support. Order must be restored in this school and everywhere in the city! I wanted you to be here. It still moves me as my first day. Believe me, to really know dogs you have to see that. Courage, my lovely. Courage. These ones are part of the fifth interbreeding for my selection. I have a purpose. I'll achieve it. The ideal dog. The best one with the best teeth. The fastest, the strongest, the smartest. Courage, my lovely. Courage. Hand me some water. She's bleeding too much! Oh, my God! She's bleeding! What can I do, my God! Call the vet. - I already called him! He has an emergency and will be here in one hour. But it will be too late! Don't move, my lovely. Don't move. Yes. A difficult birth? Haemorrhage? You should have called earlier. What? A dog? Alright, alright, I'm coming Elizabeth. That's the last straw. That's it. That's how I would have proceed with a woman in case of arrest of labor. With a higher dose of course. But I cannot be responsible if it fails. Tell me she'll survive, please tell me, Doctor. I think she's not bleeding anymore. Yes, indeed, it looks better. That's good. That's good. I'm here, I'm here with you. Yes, yes... Why are you staring at me like that? Go away now and leave me alone. Thank you. See you soon. See you soon. Hello, chief. - Hello, Keita. I want to talk with you about your friend Sambe. No. Not here. Come see me tonight at the hostel. Alright. Sambe? He went back to Senegal. Suddenly. Without telling anyone. He told you why? He was sick of your uncivilized country. And then, cops were about to arrest him. And his pal, who was he? Really, chief? They didn't tell you? It was me. But it became too dangerous. What's that? A Wolof song. He sings about your country, about dog-men. About Morel. Really? Can you tell me more? Well... You don't like Morel, huh? What did he do to you? Don't you remember? Quick! You got a meeting? No. After nine o'clock, no more niggers in the city. Come on, hasten up. Or the dog-men will bite us. Good evening, Doctor. Mr. Morel wants to see you. Please follow me. There's nothing to be afraid of, Doctor. I hope so. Let's go. I'm delighted to see you again, Doctor. I have some big news for you. But I wanted your friends to be the first to inform you. I'm leaving you. Sit down. We... we want... Listen, it's very simple. We have decided to create an union list around Morel. We must reconcile the members of this community. And tackling Morel means further increasing the divorce between them. Of course... Listen, Ferret. It's the only play we have left. We'll do a better job from the inside. He will have to reckon with us much more than if we were against him. Come on! You should join us. This would give even more weight to the stance we're going to represent. You dance? Listen, I'll be frank with you. I dropped the ball. Don't be mad at me. I got a wife and kids. Going to war against Morel means going to war against my clients. Can you understand? - Yes, of course. I know how you feel, I have clients too. You could lose them. I can't afford it. Be reassured, I understand very well your position, Mr. Montaigne. I'll get you a ride home, Doctor. Colin. Take him home. My best regards to Keita. Look at my when I speak to you. You're beautiful, you know. I love you, you know. I love you. We'll do a ton of things together. You'll stay with me forever. You're beautiful, my girl. That's good. You'll never betray me. I love you. You're a bitch but I love you. Come on! Hop! Hop! Go get it! That's good. Give now. Give, Lea. Give it now, Lea. Come on, Lea! Attention! Attention, Lea! Attention! Lea, attack! Lea! Heel! Let's go. - Henri, it was a joke. I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt you. The city is dying from this kind of jokes. You scold kids like Frank but you act like them. Shit! Don't you realize that he's turning you all into dogs! One has to wonder why you stay with me. Why do you stay with me, Elizabeth? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're coming? I want to walk with you. And with him? No, only you. Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Hi. - Hi. - How are you? I'm Fine. - My husband. Hi. - Hi. Doctor Ferret. Hi. - Hi. You'll be at the training tomorrow? - See, I didn't lie about my wife, Doc. Watch that ass! Would you excuse us? You're coming, Elizabeth? Let's go, big girl. That's enough now! Stop! Elizabeth, are you playing or dreaming? Say, how do you know Brigit's husband? He's one of my clients. Why? I'm tired. Let's go. What are you waiting for? Play! It's him. I'm sure it's him. His figure, his gait, his hands... Especially his hands. Come on, Elizabeth, pull yourself together. You always said it was a young guy and you never saw his face anyway. He was dressed like a young guy, that's it! You really don't want me to stay with you? - No. That's nice of you but I gotta get up early in the morning. Anyway, he doesn't know that I recognized him. Heel. With him, I'm not afraid. At least he's useful in that way. Aren't you ashamed goddamn pie hawker? You like me, don't you? Come here. Come. Sit down. Sit down. Good night, my love. Hello, Mrs. Gauthier? I'm sorry to bother you. Can I speak to your husband please? Long ago? No, no. Nothing urgent. No, no. Thanks. Lea! Attack! Kill him! Kill him! Stop! Kill him! Kill him! That's good! That's good! Eat him! Eat him! Doctor! Stop him! Stop him! Stop him! Stop him now! Call him back! Lea! Stop! Heel! It hurts, it hurts, please save me Doc... I just wanted to talk to her, I swear... To talk! You didn't want just to talk, bastard! I got him, that dirty bastard! We'll get all the scum like you in this city. We'll kick your asses! You think I'm gonna make it, Doc? Yes, yes... Tell him, tell him that he's going to croak! I call an ambulance. They'll get you to the hospital at the prefecture. Scum like you don't deserve to live! You're going to die, scumbag! And I'm so happy, my God! So happy! Shut the fuck up! Don't look at me like that. I'm the victim here! The dangerous maniac who attacked and raped women was finally stopped. This is the the example of a happy city where calm has returned. His mom can be reassured. There will be no kidnapping. And here's the man who made this miracle. Come say a few words, Mr. Morel. Indeed, I tried to help this city that I love so much to the extent of my resources. But it's the people who, thanks to their discipline, their courage, their self-control, their efforts, gave the example. So what, chief? You forgot our Sunday date? I'm coming. This is a nice fellow, this Morel. - Yeah, yeah. Come, let's go. It's over now. But let's try to finish in style. This is an attack that you should only use when it's clearly necessary. In case of no other solution. But you all have now reached the third level. You know your job and I trust you. You're the best. Move away. Colin, show them. Attack him! To the throat! To the throat! Stop thinking about these savages. Today, it's a party! Come here! Come over here everybody! They're all at the kennel. We're going to kick their asses. You're comin'? No way. We're fed up with all your bullshit. What's being said in that song exactly? You really want to know? Okay, I'll translate it for you. "Listen to this song about Sembe." "He was strong, he was fast," "even stronger than N'geke," "the one that entered the lion's den" "and stole his teeth." "Their cloak was the night" "and the wind their horses." "But this was an unfortunate night." "The wind had stayed in its grotto" "in the mountain." "So the dog-men came" "and ran after the thieves." "The chief said no." "He was the less mean of all the dog-men." "He wanted the hunters to go home." "But the witch doctor is stronger than the chief." "And the hunters wanted blood." Why you didn't talk to the police? The word of a black thief against the word of ten white men. You saw what happened to the mayor. Not to me. Here. Take half. Wait for my signal. Run that way! Lea! Lea! Take back your dog. Something's wrong? I'm fine. I've just seen a murder. I must see the Captain immediately. What's your name? - I told you I've just seen a murder! Wait a second. It's awful! They killed Frank! They're going to get me. We must leave at once! I'm sure they followed me. Yes, yes. You did the right thing. Hello? Hello? Lilith! Attack! Not the dogs! Not the dogs! Leave him. What are you looking at? Nothing.
