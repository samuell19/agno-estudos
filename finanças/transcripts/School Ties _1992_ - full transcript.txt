WE JUDGE OURSELVES HERE, AND WE JUDGE OURSELVES BY THE HIGHEST STANDARDS. YOU, MY BOYS, ARE AMONG THE ELITE OF THE NATION, AND WE STRIVE HERE AT ST. MATTHEW'S TO PREPARE YOU FOR THE HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY THAT COMES WITH FAVORED POSITION. TODAY, MORE THAN EVER, THIS COUNTRY NEEDS AN ELITE THAT CARES MORE FOR HONOR THAN FOR ADVANTAGE. MORE FOR SERVICE THAN FOR PERSONAL GAIN. TO THAT END, LET US BESEECH THE HELP OF GOD, IN WHOSE NAME WE PRAY. OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME.

MAN 1: WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT ON 3rd AND 1, THEY'D MAKE THAT PLAY? MAN 2: IT WAS A GREAT FOOTBALL GAME. I HAVE A SECRET. YEAH? I THINK ABOUT YOU MORE THAN I OUGHT TO. OH, THAT'S TOO BAD, BECAUSE IF YOU THINK OF ME AS MUCH AS I THINK OF YOU, WE'RE BOTH GOING TO FLUNK OUT OF SCHOOL. AM I ALL SWEATY AND RED IN THE FACE? YOU LOOK LIKE AN ANGEL. CHARLIE, LISTEN TO ME. DON'T LET YOUR BROTHER'S AWARD TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM YOUR DAY. NO, OF COURSE NOT. I THREW A GOOD BLOCK, HE GOT INTO THE HALL OF FAME. PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT NATURAL ABILITIES. IN OTHER WORDS, I SHOULD ACCEPT MY MEDIOCRITY. YOU ARE NOT MEDIOCRE. YOU WOULDN'T BE AT ST. MATT'S IF YOU WERE. SALLY: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? POOR DILLON LOOKS LIKE HE'S DYING. IF YOU MENTION CHARLIE DILLON ONCE MORE, I WILL SIT DOWN IN A HUFF. I WILL, TOO. DILLON, DILLON, DILLON. CHARLIE, CHARLIE, CHARLIE. YOU GUYS BEAT ST. LUKE'S. NOBODY THOUGHT YOU HAD A CHANCE. COME ON, ENJOY IT. I'M ENJOYING IT. CAN I GO NOW? YES, YOU CAN GO. THANKS FOR TAKING CARE OF MY GIRL. STOP SAYING THAT. I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? YOU DON'T LISTEN VERY WELL, DO YOU? COME ON, SALLY, YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME IN FRONT OF MY FRIEND. LET'S GO HAVE A TALK. YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME WITH MY FRIEND. CHARLIE, I'M SORRY. IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED. SCREW YOUR FRIEND. CHARLIE-- NO. LET HIM GO. I KNOW HIM. HE NEEDS SOME TIME TO COOL OFF. I'LL SPEAK TO HIM LATER. TO THE VICTORS. WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND? WHAT FRIEND? DO I GET A DRINK? OH, ABSOLUTELY. SCOTCH AND SODA. DEWARS AND SODA. YOU EVER MEET CAL REYNOLDS, CLASS OF '35? HOW DO YOU DO? CONGRATULATIONS. ST. LUKE'S, CLASS OF '35. THAT'S WHY HE LOOKS SO DOWN IN THE MOUTH. I WISH WE HAD FOUND THAT GREENE KID FIRST. WHY? ST. LUKE'S WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN HIM. PROBABLY NOT. WHY WOULDN'T ST. LUKE'S HAVE TAKEN HIM? GREENE? THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ENROLLED A JEW, NOT EVEN FOR A CHAMPIONSHIP. A JEW? HOLY SHIT. REYNOLDS... HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU HOW NICELY YOU KEEP A SECRET? REYNOLDS: SORRY. MAN: YEAH! WHOO! I CAN'T BELIEVE I DROPPED THAT PASS IN THE END ZONE. NEITHER CAN I. THAT'S IT. PUNISH ME. SUFFER! FORGET IT, REECE. WE WON! YEAH! WHOO! WE WON! AAH! AAH! HEY, DILLON, WHAT A BLOCK, BOY! I TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING HE KNOWS. OH, GOD SAVE ME. YOU PLAYED A GREAT GAME. WELL, WE BEAT ST. LUKE'S. YEAH! THAT WAS THE GRAND PLAN. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. THE OLD-BOY NETWORK GOT TOGETHER AND BOUGHT US A VICTORY, BUT, UH... THE JOKE'S ON US. WHAT JOKE? OH, YOU DIDN'T HEAR THE JOKE? ALL RIGHT. LET'S HEAR THE JOKE. TRUE STORY-- LAST WEEKEND THERE WAS A RELIGIOUS REVIVAL AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN. BISHOP FULTON SHEEN GAVE SUCH A STIRRING ADDRESS THAT AFTERWARDS 10,000 PEOPLE CONVERTED TO CATHOLICISM. THEN BILLY GRAHAM GOT UP, AND AFTER AN HOUR OF INSPIRED PREACHING, 10,000 PEOPLE CONVERTED TO PROTESTANTISM. FINALLY, TO END THE PROGRAM, PAT BOONE GOT UP, SANG THERE'S A GOLD MINE IN THE SKY, AND 20,000 JEWS JOINED THE AIR FORCE. WHAT'S THE MATTER, DAVID, DON'T THE JEWS HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR? YEAH, IT TURNS OUT OUR GOLDEN BOY HERE IS A LYING, BACK-STABBING KIKE. YOU KIKE! KIKE! YOU SON OF A BITCH! I'LL KILL YOU! GET THE DOOR. DAMN IT! COME ON! COME ON! I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT HIM! GO AHEAD! DENY IT! GO AHEAD! DENY IT! DENY IT! DENY IT! I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT HIM! WHY? IT'S TRUE! IT'S TRUE. HE'S A HEBE! NO! OOH! HEY, COME ON. STOP IT! UHH! ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH! COME ON! NO. YOU GOING TO KEEP YOUR FACE IN A BOOK THE REST OF THE YEAR? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO SAY? THAT IT'S NO BIG DEAL. IF THAT'S TRUE, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME BEFORE? I MEAN, I'M YOUR ROOMMATE. YOU NEVER TOLD ME WHAT RELIGION YOU ARE. A METHODIST. YOU'RE METHODIST, AND ALL THE TIME I DIDN'T KNOW IT. THAT'S DIFFERENT. REALLY? HOW'S IT DIFFERENT? IT JUST IS. JEWS ARE DIFFERENT. IT'S NOT LIKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN METHODISTS AND LUTHERANS. I MEAN, JEWS... EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM'S DIFFERENT. O.K., LET'S GET IT OUT. YOU THINK JEWS ARE DIRT. COME ON. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIKE THEM, THEN ADMIT IT TO MY FACE! SAY JEWS ARE MONEY-GRUBBING-- COME ON! COME ON. I... YOU KNOW, THE FIRST DAY I CAME TO THIS PLACE, I THOUGHT I WAS DREAMING. I KNEW IT WAS ONLY GOING TO BE FOR A YEAR, BUT I THOUGHT, "MAN, WHAT A YEAR." I'D GET INTO HARVARD. IT'S NOT EASY WHEN YOU COME FROM PODUNK PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. YOU GUYS WERE MY FRIENDS. WE WERE WINNING GAMES. I MET SALLY. I DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO MESS IT UP. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOLD THAT I COULDN'T BE A PART OF IT BECAUSE I WAS A JEW, UNDERSTAND? IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. YOU COULD HAVE TOLD US. IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE. SURE, REECE. I KNEW THAT THE FIRST NIGHT I GOT HERE WHEN I HEARD HOW McGIVERN GOT HIS HI-FI. HE JEWED HIM DOWN. REMEMBER? SURE... IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE. [BELL RINGS] ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. I'VE GRADED YOUR TAKE-HOME TRANSLATIONS. THEY WEREN'T ALL THAT BAD. MR. CONNORS, ESPECIALLY, WROTE A NEAR-FLAWLESS TRANSLATION. OOH! JACK. I NOTICED, MR. CONNORS, LIKE THE REST OF THE CLASS, YOU SIGNED THE HONOR CODE AGREEMENT. YEAH? WHICH INDICATES A PROMISE NOT TO CHEAT IN ANY WAY. YEAH. THE USE OF A PUBLISHED TRANSLATION WOULD BE CHEATING, WOULD IT NOT? I USED ONLY THE DICTIONARY. IF YOU SAY SO. YOUR TRANSLATION, HOWEVER, WAS A QUANTUM LEAP OVER YOUR PREVIOUS EFFORTS. WELL, MAYBE IT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE SUCH A GREAT TEACHER...SIR. PICK UP YOUR GRADED PAPERS. DILLON. DILLON. AH-JEW! WOULD YOU GROW UP? OH, REECE, YOU'RE SO MATURE. GARCON, PLUS D'EAU, S'IL VOUS PLAIT. EXCUSE ME. THERE'S NO SALT ON THIS TABLE. I NEED SALT FOR MY FRUIT. SOMEONE'S NOT DOING HIS MENIAL JOB. IT'S SO HARD TO FIND DECENT HELP THESE DAYS. CAN'T YOU MOVE ANY FASTER? I'LL SHOW YOU HOW FAST I CAN MOVE! DAVID, COME ON. DAVID, COME ON! IT'S NOT WORTH IT. IT'S NOT WORTH IT, O.K.? LOOK, MY NAME IS RICHARD COLLINS. WHAT'S YOURS, REECE-BERG? DAVID, I'LL WORK YOUR TABLE. YOU CAN TAKE MINE, ALL RIGHT? YOU NEED THIS JOB AS MUCH AS I DO. COME ON, GREENE. DON'T BLOW IT, O.K.? ALL RIGHT. WHAT? MAN: I'M OPEN! I'M OPEN! PASS IT UP! McGOO, PASS IT UP! HEY! MAN: LIGHTS OUT!

NICE GOING, ANNE MARIE. GREAT! MAY I HELP YOU? YES, MA'AM. I HAVE TO TALK TO SALLY WHEELER. SALLY. YOU HAVE A VISITOR. [WHISTLE BLOWS] WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU WOULDN'T TALK TO ME ON THE PHONE. SALLY, TAKE THIS DISCUSSION OUTSIDE. YES, MISS JONES. DID YOU HAVE TO COME HERE? I HAD TO HEAR IT FROM YOU. YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'VE PUT ME THROUGH. MY MOTHER DIED. SHE'S SAYING MY GRANDMOTHER WOULD TURN OVER IN HER GRAVE. YOU COULD HAVE SAID THAT ON THE PHONE. MY FRIENDS...JUST KEEP PESTERING ME. ALL THEY SAY IS, "WHAT'S IT LIKE TO KISS A JEW? DOES HIS..." GO ON. "DOES HIS NOSE GET IN THE WAY?" NICE FRIENDS. WELL, AT LEAST THEY'RE HONEST. ALL THAT STUFF YOU TOLD ABOUT LIFE IN SCRANTON? YOU DIDN'T SAY THE ONE THING YOU SHOULD'VE. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE WITH ME. WOULD YOU? DON'T LOOK AT ME THAT WAY. IT MAY SURPRISE YOU, BUT YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST JEWISH BOY I'VE MET. YOU'RE THE FIRST WHO EVER DENIED IT. I'M THE SAME GUY, SALLY. I KNOW. NO, I'M SORRY. IT JUST-- IT CAN'T HAPPEN. NO! IT CAN'T HAPPEN. IT JUST-- NOT NOW. YOU LIED TO ME. I DIDN'T LIE TO YOU! I LIED TO MY FATHER. I LIED TO MYSELF.

THIS TEST WILL COMPRISE 30% OF YOUR FINAL GRADE. YOU MAY BEGIN. [LIKE SNEEZE] OH, SHIT! [BELCHES] GOD BLESS YOU. MAN: SHH! TIME'S UP, GENTLEMEN. PAPERS TO THE FRONT. WELL, THAT WASN'T SO HARD, WAS IT? WELL, MY, MY, MR. CONNORS, YOU USUALLY DON'T HAVE THIS MUCH TO COMMUNICATE. UH... YOU WERE BOUND TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS SOONER OR LATER. DISMISSED, GENTLEMEN. WHAT'S WITH RIP? HE MUST HAVE GONE DOWN IN FLAMES. SURE, AND I GUESS YOU ACED IT, RIGHT? NATURALLY. BOOM! YOU'RE DEAD. YOU ARE DEAD! YOU ARE A FINK! CONNORS, YOU JERK! HOLD UP. HEY, WAIT UP! BE SEATED, GENTLEMEN. I REGRET TO ANNOUNCE THAT SOMEONE IN THIS CLASS CHEATED ON YESTERDAY'S EXAM. EVERYONE SIGNED THE HONOR CODE. THEREFORE, WE HAVE A RATHER BLEAK SITUATION CONFRONTING US. TODAY IS SATURDAY. YOUR NEXT CLASS IS ON MONDAY. IF THE CHEATER DOES NOT COME FORWARD OR IS NOT IDENTIFIED BY THEN, I WILL BE FORCED TO FAIL THE ENTIRE SECTION. NEED I REMIND YOU WHAT THAT MEANS? ISN'T THAT UNFAIR, SIR? ONLY ONE OF US CHEATED. WE'VE ALL BEEN DISHONORED BY THIS PERSON. I WON'T TOLERATE IT. HOW CAN YOU BE SURE SOMEONE CHEATED? I'D PREFER TO KEEP THE EVIDENCE TO MYSELF FOR THE TIME BEING. CAN'T YOU THROW OUT THE OLD TEST AND GIVE US ANOTHER, SIR? AND PRETEND THAT NO ONE CHEATED? BUT SOMEONE DID CHEAT. WHOEVER HAS DONE THIS HAS ROBBED YOU OF YOUR HONOR. IF I IGNORE IT... YOU WILL HAVE ROBBED ME OF MINE AS WELL. I LEAVE IT IN YOUR HANDS, GENTLEMEN. SOME S.O.B. BETTER ANSWER. LOOK, SOMEONE MUST HAVE SEEN SOMETHING. COME ON. AND DO WHAT? GIERASCH DUMPED IT IN OUR LAPS. I WORKED MY ASS OFF FOR FOUR YEARS. BECAUSE OF ONE LIAR MY LIFE'S RUINED? EASY. WHOEVER DID THIS, ADMIT TO IT. YOU CAN'T LET HIM FAIL THE CLASS. THERE'S TIME. I WISH I COULD GET IT OUT OF MY MIND, BUT I'VE GOT THIS APPALLING FEELING... I HAVE A GOOD IDEA WHO DID IT. MAYBE CONNORS CAN ENLIGHTEN US. YOU LIKE HAVING TEETH, SPASTIC? YOU'VE SLACKED OFF. CLEARY ALL BUT ACCUSED YOU OF CHEAT-- CLEARY'S A SICK SHIT! SO ARE YOU, YOU FOUR-EYED RUNT. I'VE BEEN IN MORE TROUBLE THAN ANY OF YOU. WHEN HAVE I EVER NOT ADMITTED TO SOMETHING? ADMIT THIS. COME HERE, YOU LITTLE RUNT! COME HERE! COME ON! COME ON, JACK! YOU BASTARDS AREN'T PINNING THIS ON ME. FINE. JUST FINE. VERY COOL, McGOO. I'M SORRY HE'S OFFENDED, BUT THIS CAN RUIN EVERYBODY'S LIVES. LOOK, WE GOT THREE OF THE PREFECTS HERE, RIGHT? YOU GUYS GOT TO HANDLE THIS. LET'S SLEEP ON IT. WE'LL MEET TOMORROW MORNING IN THE FOUNDERS' ROOM. WHOEVER'S GUILTY, YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING. DILLON. [DOOR CLOSES] WE HAVE TO TALK. I KNOW IT WAS YOU. I CAN DESCRIBE THE CRIB SHEET. THAT'S GIERASCH'S EVIDENCE. HAVE YOU SEEN IT SINCE YOU USED IT? IF I CHEATED AND YOU SAW AND DIDN'T REPORT IT, YOU'D BE IN VIOLATION, TOO. I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T LET THE WHOLE CLASS FAIL. HE'S BLUFFING. HE WON'T FAIL ANYBODY. GIERASCH WOULDN'T BLUFF. DAVID, YOU-- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WAY IT IS. A THING LIKE THIS, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT CAN DO TO YOU. MY FAMILY EXPECTS ME TO MEASURE UP TO SOMETHING THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. I CAN'T DO IT. I TRY. SET IT STRAIGHT. DAVID. DAVID? WHAT? LOOK... I-I'M BEGGING YOU. I'M SORRY. I WAS A PRICK. I WAS A PREJUDICED PRICK. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. JUST CONFESS. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT, O.K.? NOTHING FOR NOTHING, RIGHT? HOW MUCH FOR YOUR SILENCE? EITHER YOU TELL HIM OR I DO. SON OF A BITCH! WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY WHERE YOU BELONG? I GUESS, UM, ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS, UM, HOW MANY THINK I COULD HAVE DONE IT? YOU SCREWED UP A COUPLE OF ASSIGNMENTS. YEAH. SO? WHAT ARE YOU PULLING, C-PLUS? WHAT ABOUT THIS FRENCH TEST? CLEARY SAYS HE CHEATED. IF HE CHEATED BEFORE, WHY WOULDN'T HE CHEAT AGAIN? CONNORS: I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T CHEAT. CAN WE BELIEVE YOU? NOBODY'S EVER CHEATED BEFORE. MAYBE WE SHOULD-- ALL RIGHT, LAY OFF. IT WASN'T CONNORS. THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ME TO--TO SAY. I KNOW IT'LL DISAPPOINT SOME OF YOU, AND I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD THE TRUTH YESTERDAY. I KNOW WHO CHEATED. WHO? IT WAS GREENE. WHAT? YEAH, GREENE. I SAW HIM DO IT. YOU'RE A LIAR! I SAW HIM CHEAT. DON'T SQUIRM. ADMIT IT. I GAVE HIM THE CHOICE OF CONFESSING. HEY, COME ON! I SAW YOU! GUYS, COME ON! WORD OF HONOR, I SAW HIM CHEAT. LET'S GO TO GIERASCH'S OFFICE. WE'LL TELL HIM THE SITUATION. SITUATION? I TURNED HIM IN. HE'S DENYING IT. TELL GIERASCH. GIERASCH WILL THROW IT BACK AT US. WE HAVE TO DECIDE. WOULD YOU BOTH TRUST US TO BE FAIR? OF COURSE I TRUST THE CLASS. GREENE? WHY SHOULD HE TRUST US? WHY SHOULDN'T HE UNLESS HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE? DO YOU? GREENE? DAVID, DON'T DO IT, ALL RIGHT? I GOT NO CHOICE, DO I? IT'S HOW IT'S DONE, RIGHT? THIS IS THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DONE. ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS DECIDE. LOOK, IT'S ONE GUY'S WORD AGAINST THE OTHER. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO TO THE HEAD. WE CAN HANDLE THIS OURSELVES. LET'S JUST DO IT. WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? HAVE WE HEARD FROM EVERYBODY? DONALD? I SUBMIT DILLON DIDN'T CHEAT. WHY NOT? BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE TO. HE'S GOING TO BE FIFTH GENERATION AT HARVARD. NOT SO WITH GREENE. McGIVERN WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FIFTH GENERATION AT PRINCETON, TOO. SO? SO NOTHING'S FOR SURE, McGOO. LET'S GO OVER THIS AGAIN. AS I SEE IT, THERE'S AN OBJECTIVE FACT. ONE'S LIED IN THE PAST, AND ONE HASN'T. DAVID NEVER LIED ABOUT ANYTHING. YES, HE DID. HE LIED ABOUT BEING A JEW. NO ONE EVER ASKED HIM. BECAUSE NO ONE HAD ANY IDEA BECAUSE HE LIED. GIERASCH SAYS THE CRIB SHEET WAS BLOCK-PRINTED. NO WAY TO TELL WHO WROTE IT. HE SAID THE REPUTATION OF THE SCHOOL AND THE HONOR CODE'S FUTURE IS ON OUR SHOULDERS. SCREW THE SCHOOL. WHAT ABOUT US? THE SCHOOL HAS ITS HONOR, OUR LIVES ARE RUINED. MY LIFE'S SCREWED IF I DON'T GET INTO YALE. I NEED MY GRADES. A SCHOLARSHIP'S ALMOST CERTAIN. I CAN'T TELL MY FATHER I FAILED HISTORY. WE BUSTED OUR BUTTS FOR FOUR SOLID YEARS. NOW ONE PERSON'S KILLING US. IT'S GOT TO BE GREENE. RIP, WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO THINK? I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM, ANYWAY? EVERYTHING. IT'S LIKE MY DAD SAYS ABOUT JEWS-- RIGHT AWAY HE TRIED TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF INTO OUR CROWD. THAT'S BULLSHIT. HE WANTED IN WITHOUT HAZING OR ANY WORK. HE WAS A SENIOR. JESUS, CAN WE KEEP THE JEWISH STUFF OUT OF THIS? WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE HE IS JEWISH, STUPID. McGOO, YOU'RE A BIGOT. I RESENT THAT. RESENT ALL YOU WANT, ASSHOLE. YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE TO START NEEDLING HIM. HEY! HEY! I CONFESS. I ADMIT, YOU KNOW, I'M AN ANTI-SEMITE. I CRACK JEW JOKES. I THINK THEY'RE GREEDY, PUSHY... YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING ELSE, GUYS? DAVID GREENE'S THE FIRST ONE I'VE MET UP CLOSE. WHAT'S YOUR POINT, CONNORS? HE WAS A GOOD GUY. THAT GUY WOULDN'T CHEAT. SO YOU THINK DILLON DID? YEAH, I THINK DILLON CHEATED. THAT MAKES TWO OF US. THREE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. ME, NEITHER. YOU WANT TO DUMP DILLON FOR A DIRTY JEW. IT'S 1 A.M. ARE WE GOING TO DECIDE THIS? NOT UNLESS WE CAN BE FAIR AND IMPARTIAL. WHAT'S WITH YOU, REECE? EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT JEWS ARE LIKE. HOW MANY DO YOU KNOW, McGOO? HAD ANY TO YOUR HOUSE? I ONLY HAVE TO KNOW ONE-- THE GUY WHO TOOK DILLON'S PLACE ON THE TEAM. SNEAKS OFF WITH DILLON'S GIRL. STABBED IN THE BACK. HE'S NOT EVEN PAYING HIS OWN WAY. WAKE UP, GUYS! CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? YOU WANT TO NAIL GREENE 'CAUSE HE KNEW HOW YOU FEEL. IS ANYONE ELSE TIRED OF THIS? YES. YES. LET'S JUST VOTE. HANDS OR SECRET BALLOTS? ALL: SECRET BALLOTS. IF WE'RE DOING IT, WE'LL DO IT IN THE OPEN. ALL: BALLOTS. BALLOTS! AS HEAD PREFECT, I'VE BEEN ASKED-- IT'S THE FINDING OF THE CLASS-- THE MAJORITY OF THE CLASS-- THAT THE GUILT LIES WITH DAVID GREENE. MR. GREENE, YOU'RE REQUESTED TO TURN YOURSELF IN TO THE HEADMASTER. ALL RIGHT. I'LL HONOR YOUR TRADITIONS. I'LL GO TO THE HEADMASTER... AND I'LL LIE. THANKS, BUD. GOOD MORNING, MR. GREENE. WE WERE BEGINNING TO WONDER IF YOU'D CHANGED YOUR MIND. YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE? INDEED. TO CONFESS TO CHEATING. THAT'S RIGHT. I CHEATED ON THE HISTORY EXAM. NO, DAVID. YOU DID NO SUCH THING. I SAW DILLON CHEAT. HE WAS MY ROOMMATE FOR FOUR YEARS. THANK YOU, MR. VAN KELT. YOU ARE EXCUSED. DAVID... I'M SORRY. I DID BREAK THE HONOR CODE. YES. AS DID VAN KELT. BUT THE HONOR CODE IS A LIVING THING. IT CANNOT EXIST IN A VACUUM. WE ABSOLVE YOU BOTH ON THAT ACCOUNT. MR. DILLON, HOWEVER, IS EXPELLED. DAVID, YOU REPRESENT THE BEST OF WHAT WE HOPE FOR AT ST. MATTHEW'S. PLEASE DON'T THINK OF LEAVING. GOOD. THEN IT'S SETTLED. I'D LIKE TO FORGET THIS EVER HAPPENED. NO, SIR. YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO FORGET IT HAPPENED, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO STAY, AND EVERY DAY YOU SEE ME, YOU'LL REMEMBER IT HAPPENED. YOU USED ME FOR FOOTBALL. I'LL USE YOU TO GET INTO HARVARD. EXCUSE ME. YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I'M STILL GOING TO GET INTO HARVARD. IN 10 YEARS, NOBODY'S GOING TO REMEMBER ANY OF THIS, BUT YOU'LL STILL BE A GODDAMN JEW. YOU'LL STILL BE A PRICK.
