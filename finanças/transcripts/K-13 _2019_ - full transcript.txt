Hello, bro. It's me calling. I just checked. Are you suspicious on me? Definitely. Check yourself on the mirror. Okay, bye. Why aunty has left the yoga mat in the lift? He too adds fuel to the problems. Oh...oh... My place. Dude, I'll move. Dude, he is an excellent producer. He didn't even let me approach him. You got a very good opportunity. Don't miss it. Mathi, the screenplay is amazing. I don't deny that. But, this budget is too high for a debut film. Earlier, the shoot was done for ten days and got stalled. Sir, that is... -of course, It's not your mistake. I'm just telling you. This field (Cinema) believes in superstitions. Just tell me a simple line. But, only two days. If you don't tell me... I'll give the project to him. You're following up for an year now and you're good at scripting. That's the only reason I'm offering this opportunity. If it's impressive, we'll commence the project soon. But, just two days. Don't mistake me, Mathi. Even this second chance is only for your dad's sake. He had worked as Co-director for twenty years and... Fine! Come day after tomorrow. Okay! Let's do this. Brother... Hey, why did you guys come here? Come...come... What's this? It's similar to an investigation room. Come... Clear out. What's all these? Writing... it's writing. He'll write the story like this. You mean, story? Hey, check this out! -go away. He has broken doors. -I'm papa speaking. Who is that peeping through the door? Our Jack! Brother, it should be cool. -say, cheese! Brother, it should be cool. -cheese! Tell me that number. Don't disgrace me. -98 Hey, -409 Oh... -02729 Don't both of you've shoot? It's cancelled. They've come as it's free booze. You think of everyone like you. Brother, instead of straining just to write.. I'll give you four hard disks. Four films. Just write cheerfully. Hey. Dude, don't you have many story lines? You don't you narrate a few. Don't you know the huge demand for Adult comedy? The budget is not set right, dude. You're not smart enough, dude. Brother, it's just cinema. If you say this is just cinema, I'll take your life, just like that! Why? The way we perceive the movies is different from his. Be quiet. Dude, is everything ready? Everything is ready, buddy. Good job, bro. Come on, let's go. -hundred points for you. No, I'm not coming. No. -It's okay. Come. I'm not coming. Brother... He is going to turn a lunatic like that Jack.... ...the one behind the door. Have you seen that film? In the end, that writer kills his wife and son. Have you seen it? Stop showing off your World Cinema intellect! Were you not the one who was amazed watching "Anaconda". If you've watched "The shining" Wouldn't we've seen it? Not only in films, even in the real life there are psycho writers. Brother, isn't it too much for our place? Even in our place, there are people who does anything for the sake of art. There are method actors who work hard to justify their roles. All this is possible only, when there is passion on cinema. Go and continue you've come for. You stay as the lunatic Jack. Let me be the Titanic Jack. Come. -"every night in my dreams..." I'm not coming. Understand me. I'm not coming. C'mon dude! You might find your story even there. Hey, why are you coming irky? I have signed the second film and throwing a party happily. But, you continue to rant. I know. First film. Can't do high budget. Producer has asked to narrate another story line. I'm not getting any spark. It's the season of thriller genre. and is looking for the same! Oh, won't he settle for anything else?! Why don't we rip-off half of that Korean movie, We watched another movie the other day, right? And the Chinese movie, for the other half. Oh, my ghosh! Why don't we throw you out? Vatsa. Buddy, somehow we'll make it. Cool, dude. Do you remember the number I said? 984... Do you remember? I don't. -98-409-027-29 Thank you very much, ji. Wow! Hello brother, bring the liquor to the parking lot of the pub. Liquor?! The important stuff which I said, brother. Okay, I'll come. The fatso seems loaded... I'll come in five minutes. Okay, done. He is a habitual drinker for generations. What's that? Brother, it's our special stuff. We'll rock. Hey, we are going to booze, right? Then why all these? A cost of a bottle here equals a peg there. You're right. -Hey stingy, It's me who's giving the treat right! Do whatever you want. Let's go tonight.. Celebrate the whole night.. Tomorrow, we'll fish for plenty of story lines! Wonder, whatever we are going to fish! Hey, isn't it too much? Bro, not just one, you'll find millions of stories if you take this. Just get high. Vatsa. Don't spoil everyone. -Oh, my god! Hey Vatsa, this sin won't let you off easily. Thank you. -worst behaviour. Awesome... Vatsa, each and every story is like a new birth. Here he goes! We should be born, live and die along with it. Take it. That's Ok! I got more! You have fun! -Crazy bugger! Thank you, boss. Bro... please. I brought them saying as treat. They're staring me. I told you, isn't it? Not to believe him. Come, let's go. How much, bro? Somehow, I managed to come along. Please, go. Come this side. Go. You're inebriated. Go... He is going to get alcohol for free. Hey, I feel ashame. How long? You would've asked her. We don't have time. We would've gone to TASMAC. Where is she? Has she left? Hey! Look here! Dude, superb! Will you ask or shall I? I'll ask dude. Dude, go... Dude! Finally, you're rocking. Who are you? Why did you bring me here? You came on your own. If you wanted to die, why din't you go elsewhere. This is your house, right? Your house... Okay. Why did you get me here? I'll kill you, if you stare like that. I'll kill you. Sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know, what your problem is? But, for ten long years... Cinema, love, humiliation and hard work... Tomorrow is the day of outcome for everything. But, you ruined everything. Who are you? I did not even know who you were until last night. Money is not important to me. The love on cinema. In fact I haven't even been in love! Even last night, I came here because I was high. But, I haven't done anything. Yes, I haven't done anything. It's you...you...you... You are the reason for everything. I won't lose my cinema for anything. I'm going away from here. It's up to you... "Has the night left out of hand?" "Has the night left out of hand?" "The breeze at night awaits to leave" "The time the demon stays" "Why this turbulence ?" "The thought trembles on..." "Will you escape being caught in the stone box?" "You've come close to death" "You've come listening to a girl" "No way to escape...!" "The fire spread as a circle!" "Has the night left out of hand?" "The breeze at night awaits to leave" "The time the demon stays" "Why this turbulence ?" "The thought trembles on..." I published a book. Title? "Mirage". "Kaatchi pizhai" . "The cries of death is heard" "Struggling for life...!" "Will hit the person" "The fear bursts, over night" "The cries of death is heard" "Struggling for life...!" "Will hit the person" "The fear bursts, over night" "And the whirl wind" "The dream come true!" "When spotting the blood, Haven't recovered yet from forgetfulness" "Has the night left out of hand?" "The breeze at night awaits to leave" "The time the demon stays" "Why this turbulence ?" "The thought trembles on..." Hey, I don't believe in ghosts. Do not scare me! Alright. Me...You... Let's just talk. Okay? Okay? I'm sorry. Sorry, okay? I need to go away from here. I'm not in the right state to worry about you. But, I'm sure someone will come and... Will come and... You won't allow me to go from here, right? Failed love? Looks like, you're a bookworm. There is not just one love, don't you know that? Isn't it love failure? If death is the solution for all the problems, I should've been dead long ago. The first time during a shoot, when the director cursed me... ...a moron before hundreds of people. When my friend pitched my script as his and succeeded. That's okay. I received advance and signed my first film... ...and got stalled after ten days of the shoot. Damn! Don't know why I am ranting to you! She is dead and taking out my life. Sorry. Sorry, alright? Greetings, sir. Is this the time to come? Got stuck with work at the first floor. I'll quickly finish it in an hour. You said that you'll finish the work in the morning. How late you're? -I will finish it. Be careful. Hey, Police guys! it's the police! Don't go to the 20th floor, cops are around! Twenty floors! How do you manage during power failure? We have back up, madam. You guys got everything. It's over. Everything is over. Ten years of my dreams are shattered. Brother, Come back after five minutes. Okay, madam. Come this side. Just leave it and come. You stay that side Why the police has come? Why should we bother?

No, they're still around. Forgive me, Pavi. No, you won't. Just talk to me once. Please. I was alone even before you came. It's not new. But, talk to me once. I didn't do wantedly. I swear, I didn't expect that Vijay will come to know about this. Why did you make me come here? This is not going to change anything. Vijay, I made you to come. Vijay, please. My guilt will kill me. Are you joking? Who the hell are you? Why should I care if you feel guilty. Bullshit Don't waste my time. -Vijay, please. I plead you. At least, for me? For you? You've done a story on the private life of your friend Just for your fame and name, And minted money from that. For such a damn cheap person like you. But, you're least of my worry. But, no one betrayed me like you in my life. Vijay, please. I'm sorry. -Shut up. Don't say sorry. Don't say sorry. Are you both enacting a drama? We couldn't have a child for 8 years.. Without the husband's knowledge.. With the help of your colleague, Anand.. You've given birth to a child by artificial insemination... You cite the reason as for the child and for the family Shit. Vijay, you didn't come for check-up. -don't you dare. Don't you dare. Dare to blame me. Yes, I didn't come for the check up. So, can't we live without a child? Or can't we wait? When husband is working away, You slept with someone and speaking like a martyr. Vijay, -Vijay, no. Oh no...no... Vijay read this book, you'll understand. Are you mad? I'm have written facts from her side. Hiding her shameful act from me.. And you've told the whole world about it.. Damn! No one knows its your story! Please. But, I know. I know of her shameful act right?! By this time Anand would've announced it to the whole world. But, thanks to you. I wouldn't have known anything about her, if it wasn't for you. Vijay, please. -Stop it. Lunatics! Both of you! You're a psycho. You, a betrayer. I can't believe this is all happening. Do you know now, why no one is with you? Because, you're a monster. In this entire world, the sensitive issue which is known only to me and Anand, I told you being unable to bear the mental agony. I trusted you. I trusted you more than anyone. You shattered the whole purpose of my act You never see the people around you as humans made of flesh and blood. Everything is a story for you. Everyone are characters. I curse you. You'll regret this. Hello, Where are you? Mam, it'll take 45 minutes for me to reach. Okay, come. Okay, mam. I just took the plot from what you said as an inspiration, And wrote the story justifying your act. I miscalculated that no one is going to know the source. Wonder, how Vijay came to know about this. Writers will go to any extreme for the sake of the stories. But, I won't be forgiven. Definitely, you'll feel reluctant to talk to a stranger. That too to a psychiatrist, with this kind of attire. It's even more difficult, isn't it? But, you need not talk to us. We have a special arrangement for you. Someone just like you but, out of depression! You can talk to her right? How do I talk to someone stranger about this? Not just a stranger. To a person who has come out of depression. Both of you won't know each other. You talk to such a person right? Hi, Hi, Why did you come here? Why did you come here? Why have you come? If I feel like talking to someone, I'll come here. Tell me. Why have you come? Depression. Who told you that you're in depression? What's this question? I know that. Even my friends told. How did they say that? I am a loner. I won't talk to anyone. Even if I talk, I will get angry. Okay. But, who told you cannot to be like this? If we don't behave to other's expectations, Is that a disease? Look at the world around us. Would you even feel to get along with them? What's wrong in wanting to be alone? Don't you have friends? There was one. I lost her. We'll talk about you. Okay. What are you doing? I'm an assistant director in cinema. I have a story, waiting for the producer. Do you write stories? Stories are my lifelines! I had written a story, shot for ten days and got stalled. Post that, I couldn't write... Writer's block. Yes. How do you know? I write too.. Oh, for cinema? No. Let's talk only about you. But, don't we need solitude for writing? What is the need for treatment? I'm in the same field for ten years. With the doubt lingering over my break.. and being unable to write anything.. I have even thought of killing myself. Haven't you ever felt like this? Many times. How did you come out of it? Who told you, I'm out of it? What are you saying? Your name? You tell me. Then, I'll tell you. Mathi. Mathiazhagan. Your name? Hello. Hey... Hello. The climax is a mess! Some dude named Go-Pro Gopal ruined the whole show. The drones are flying all over. On the whole, film is a flop. It's good film, dude. It's sparking, bro. It's superb, dude. Bro, just a minute. How was the movie? It was good. Actually, I'm an assistant director of this film. Really? -yes. The other person rubbished the film, what do you think about it? We slogged for two years, But, he put down the film in two minutes. That's his wish. Actually, I'm an assistant director of this film. Hey, friends. Shyam bro's treat it is! We are going to abduct the writer. Okay? Come...come... Brother... Hey, why did you guys come here? Come...come... What's this? It's similar to an investigation room. Come... If you tell me its just cinema.. I will take your life just like that! I'm not coming. -hey, come on. How can you do like this? -I'm not coming. You go. I'm not coming. Hey, come. I'm not coming. Please. Come... -please. Come on, bro. You might get your story, even there. Come on! Actually, I'm waiting for my boyfriend. Hey, hey... Take it easy, director sir. Sorry, okay. I am high and.. You know, sorry. Not that, It's okay. I'm just saying not now. What do you want now? You heard, right? What do you want now? Trick question? Let it be. Tell, what do you want now? At the moment, the only thing on my mind is to write a good story. It must be stunning when heard. Different! Nobody should've done something like that. Even today, when I started to this place I wasn't interested. But you know, we both met each other, Now, I'm not interested to leave from here. Shall I tell? A story line? I must think. Only when it comes from my I get the kick! Still, let me be your inspiration. Inspiration? I know you'll be an awesome inspiration. But you know, this matter is... My place. Now? Okay, I'll tell my friends. Don't tell them about me. And, Let's not leave together. I'll pick you up at the signal. I will neither tell about you... …nor about coming to your house... nor about what is going to happen there! How long will it take to reach your place? Just five minutes. My house is nearby. Okay. Tell me about you. About me... Nothing much to say! I'm from a middle class family. I left my parents and staying alone. Actually, there is no reason in particular. They didn't like me. I didn't like them. I have my own rules. Is it? Oh. It's been six years since I left my parents. Oh. Actually, it all started from this tattoo. Looks good. I had one friend. I lost her. That too because of my writing. But... Writing is my life. For me as well. Sometimes, the love for writing blinds our eyes, isn't it? Right. I don't know why. I'm unable to write anything for almost a year. I think I have lost it. The only friend, I had. Hey, Oh, no. I couldn't do anything else. Same pinch! I have all the problems that you have. But, what to do? Without thinking about anything, Let's be happy. But, one... Which one? I have got an idea for a new story. Like asking forgiveness for my fault. All the best. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, here? Mathi. Can you hear? I can hear you. Can you hear me? Are you going to read now? By writing someones life as a story.. I shattered their life... By giving you an important day of my life, I decided to give you a life. Is the story important now? Definitely, I'll be an inspiration for your story, Okay. Mathi. Your next few hours will be a big inspiration for you. But, you must promise me. Okay, ask me. In your film, If you take it as a film... Mention it as my story. Flash my name "Malarvizhi"! I will. Promise? I have come here with that purpose for that right? Not just one film... ...I'll do that in all the films. I swear. Okay. Your name is, Malar... Malar... Malarvizhi. You have to mention it as My story. Flash my name "Malarvizhi" Swear now! Alright? Are you mad? What have you done? How can I ever escape from this? You didn't die for my sake. You've killed my dream for your sake. Will anyone believe all these? Inspiration? Bullshit! Did I ever ask you? I'll post any damn thing on Facebook. so? Damn! My fate. It's true that I was struggling. But is this what you do? What do you care? You died in peace. I'm stuck. Let me be your inspiration. All the best. Cameras are broken in this floor and near Gate 3 in particular! You had planned everything so that I don't get caught. You believed that I'll escape from here. I'll escape as you wished. You could've spoken your mind to me last night. Hey, I'm on my way to the terrace. Come fast. Just ten minutes. I'm travelling for work a lot. Is everything okay? -thank you. Yeah...yeah.... Otherwise, I have no issues with you all. Hey, the SI has come. -Pavithra. Hello, mam. Have you brought the keys? Yes, mam. Now, how to go to the terrace? The lift always has power backup. Oh, yes. What is wrong with the electricity today? They have dug up near the transformer. Are they turning on the generator? Hold on! They are are just re-filling the diesel. Will turn it on after that. Mention it as My story. Flash my name "Malarvizhi" Promise! Alright! Oh, no. Sorry, sir. Sir, isn't that you? What are you doing here sir? Alright Sir! Sorry Sir!... -Dhileep sir. Everyone is awaiting for you at the party. Producer asked to bring you. My party is right here. Sir, producer asked you to come. -Dhileep. What are you doing here? These days, success party is a big feat! You're just standing here. Everyone is waiting for you. Come, let's go. No, sir. I'm leaving. C'mon! Why do you never get along with anyone? Come and enjoy! Come. Come, let's go. No, it's okay, sir. I'm leaving. -Dude, come here. Thank you. Dhileep, take your advance. You're doing the next film for me. -definitely sir. The heroine has arrived. -Thank you. Come. Sorry, I'm late. Everyone inside is talking about you that you've acted well. Thank you, sir. Sir is the reason. Come, let's go inside. I'll come, sir. Dhileep sir, aren't you coming? No, I'm leaving. Why he is not even coming for the success party? He is a crazier than the girl from the film. That's why the story is also similar. Not at all, he is a nice person. This story is an inspiration of a real incident. Didn't you read? In a hotel in OMR, a north Indian IT girl went missing. "One fine evening!"
