Asmik Ace Entertainment, IMJ Entertainment, Nippon Television Network Corporation SDP & Culture Publishers present an Asmik Ace Entertainment /IMJ Entertainment production. In 1958, a gay bar opened its doors in a Ginza back alley. It was called Himiko. As its fame grew in gay circles, on the night club scene and among the cultural elite, the bar became a Ginza legend. In 1985, the first "proprietress" retired with cirrhosis. Yoshida Teruo, age 40, who exploded on the scene like a comet, took over as proprietress. Thanks to her charming wit rivaling her predecessor, the bar flourished, but she suddenly retired in 2000. The bar closed down, too. Two months later, in Kanagawa Prefecture a home for the elderly quietly opened near Oura Beach. LA MAISON DE HIMIKO. What? No way. It's been 2 years. About that long. Yamaoka san was here. The one with those fat calves? Exactly. We used to use the same shampoo. Every time I passed her, she smelled like my bath. Whenever I took a shower, I dreamed she was beside me, naked, too. You've got a wild fantasy life. Which shampoo do you use? That was harassment. Phone Sex Operators - 35,000 Yen. Yoshida san! You got some calls. While you were out, about 3. From Kaito Construction, Ikemoto Trading and... From Kishimoto Haruhiko. The message? Kaito Construction said... Not that one. Kishimoto Haruhiko. Oh, the usual He asked to speak to Yoshida Saori. So I said you weren't available. I told him not to call you anymore I did tell him that. Long day! Welcome back. Yoshida. A guest. Out front Name's Kishimoto, or something. No use showing up here. So, he's got cancer or it's terminal, it's nothing to me. Hurry up and die, is what I say. Conversation finished, don't come back I'll pay you. Money. You know this place, right? The old people's home your father built for gays 5 years ago. Could you help out there part-time? Work one day a week on Sunday and you get... I know you're stuck for money. You're checking out phone sex operator ads at work, right? The girl who answered the phone told me all kinds of stuff. I've thought it all through. I know you stopped speaking to him a long time ago, and you'd hardly consider looking after him. But this is just a part-time job 30,000 Yen a day, helping out at the home. It's not such a bad offer, is it? Besides, there's the inheritance... Right? What is it? Why do you go to such lengths for him? Because he's precious. Because I love him. Hello. What do you want, sister? Hello. Are you watching. "Lady Lawyer Mystery Files?" That's right. It's already started. You already watched it... Record it yourself... That Takao san? No, Ruby. This series is endless. Hasn't the lady lawyer gone back to her husband? No. I'm going home. Hey, hey, wait. The money went to my head. Calm down, you made it this far. Calm down! Have a seat. He rarely leaves his room, now. He's on a higher dose of morphine. He was still healthy when he bought this place. Wait a minute... You the new part-timer? I'm Himiko, a pleasure. Perfect timing. We're having brunch. A Sunday tradition. We all bring our favorite foods. Pancakes with seasonal fruit. Steaming hot rice with salted river fish. Everyone will share. Are you... by any chance... Serve the salad. Chubby! Poses! Want some pickled turnips? What a creep I'll come back as a ballerina. Not the owner of a sumo wrestler? A ballerina when I'm single, and a sumo wrestler owner once I marry Ruby, this is the new part-timer, Yoshida Saori Ruby and Yamazaki. Nice to meet you. She's a transsexual Still needs some more work up here. Honey, a cow with attitude is worse than an aging queen Ruby! She's dreadful. Even with part-timers, I thought I told you to hand-pick our employees. This is not just any old-age home. Have you still not got that through your head? Besides, this isn't my scene. I may have one foot in the grave, but I'm not so far gone as to find this farce thrilling. What farce is that? Beats me. Are you OK? You had to come a long way. Do you need go back to your room? Just a little dizzy spell. Don't fool yourself. I'm only here because your man promised to pay me. Hosokawa Painters. Huh? That's bullshit! I told you, Yamada's in charge of the project! Give me a break! About the new secretary, the interviews... This one and this. Please don't choose based on photos. Hey, Daisuke. Yes. Which of these girls... I said, no! You choose, then. Hello, get in touch with Yamada. Decide for yourself. Quit bugging me! This one. Why? Because I bet she has fat thighs. Honey, I hear you're in debt? Ruby... What kind of debt? Which is better? A cow with debts or with venereal disease? My mother died 3 years ago... Because her useless jerk of a husband ditched her years ago. I heard she had cancer. Atypical housewife, learns from her husband that he's a queen, who chucks her away like garbage. All by herself, she worked like a dog, raised her kids and keeled over. She got cancer because she was miserable. Yes, so? I had to borrow from all our relatives to pay her medical costs. Satisfied? I had no idea. Of course. You're a total stranger. Question! Miss, are you a lesbian, too? When two girls do it, do you use a vibrator? How old are you, Miss? You fucking brats! Shit, the queens are fighting back. You virgins get home and masturbate! Homo, homo, homo! Homo! We shouldn't laugh. Are you OK? You're a virgin... "Who knows where this queer's hands have been!" "A man, where? There?" "Oh no! Disgusting! Filthy!" Virgins are such idiots. Cut it out, Ruby My stomach aches. Himiko's daughter, a virgin at her age? Don't make me laugh. How dare you! How can I touch a filthy faggot's hand! You! That's called anti-gay discrimination. You discriminate against another human being! My watermelon... It's like "piki piki picky!" No, not like that. That's incomprehensible. See, you hurt your hips, like "piki piki picky!" You'll just break your pelvis that way. Lousy. Damn you! Hey! That bitch pisses me off! She called me lousy. I think we're all getting hungry, now. Shut up! This is the good part. Me... lousy... Listen... Ruby wants... Ask her yourself. I am not a virgin! That's not it? I'm sorry about the other day I must've been cranky from my period. Just kidding! My period days are over. Just get on with it. Shut up! There's an order to these things. What does "piki piki picky" mean? You said we were lousy at it. Answer me! Listen, despite my looks, I was married, once. Oh, no, I've heard this 100 times I've heard it 500. Youthful folly. I thought I could make it as a man, I really tried. I even forced myself to make a baby, a son. Haven't seen him since he was 5. But my ex-wife kept me posted. He graduated college and went to work for the city. A real bureaucrat, impressive, huh? He's all married and has a child. A girl, I believe. Don't make me laugh My very own granddaughter. Teeny tiny hands and teeny tiny legs. So, so cute, right? You've never even seen her. No, but she's a child so of course her hands and legs are teeny tiny. But my ex-wife died 2 years ago. At the time I thought that was the end of that. No contact at all. But then, but see... Last November 12th, I got a postcard. Out of the blue. The whole postcard was covered with "piki piki picky". But there was no return address. I'm sure it came from my cute granddaughter. Of course, it was your granddaughter. But if a 7 year old can only write "piki piki picky," she may be stupid. I used to teach elementary school. Usually, by age 7, they're beyond that I don't care if she's dumb. So cute. She may be dumb, but she wrote to me, "piki piki picky!" 2,000 Yen. What for? You're quite the operator. All right, I'll pay. It's the magic spell From the anime, "Rainbow Warrior". Magic? I knew it was magic I see... A spell to help her meet me, "piki piki picky," like that. "We don't really want to fight!" "All right, last resort!" All right, last resort! You really resemble her. Hey, good morning. Oh, this? Our sponsor is visiting. He used to also be the president of the company where I worked. Apparently he also invested in Himiko's old bar I thought she died 3 years ago. She did not die! She sent me a new years' card I see. Well, how about the one who became president, of that something-or-other bank... Oh, um, Saito. Saito-san's fine and well. Saito san's just fine. When Tachikawa san passed, she had a company funeral. Good for her, a company funeral. The day I retired, he gave me a pamphlet about this place out of the blue... I'd never discussed my sexuality with him, not once. No, I knew. The president had a fine family, but there was just something... Are you sure about Himiko? She was looking forward to it. I don't like sick people. Even Himiko, if she's dying, I have no interest. I came today about money. I've always donated money to this home, for Himiko's sake. But she's dying. In other words, I'll have no more reason to help. You're going to stop contributing? That's what I was thinking. However, when I learned today, that a man of your beauty, would be taking over the directorship... Let's see... What to do. Get in. Chubby wants you. Says it's time for dinner. When'd you get back? Did you do it? With that dirty old man? Barf-city. It's not like I'm only into older men. But Himiko used to date him, so I did have expectations. But he's lousy in the sack... You're the worst! But at least the home will be safe for a while. Perverts Die! Wipe Out Homos! I hate those fucking brats! Horrible... I'll drown them in the sea. Your blood pressure. Shut up! What's this! "Perverts Die" "Homos." Dammit! What's that symbol? So, your father runs Kishimoto Construction? Please give my regards to your father I'll give it to him. I assumed you were Yoshida's boyfriend. Not at all. Figured she got real lucky. I'm not interested in women. And you? Me? Don't men ever come on to you? Yeah, in college, a guy on the football team suddenly pinned me down. He said "This won't hurt" I said, "The hell it won't" and took off. Should've joined the "This won't hurt" team. Didn't have the slightest interest. He was an awful big guy... What about me, then? Just kidding. Shouldn't make fun of straights. Sankyo University's Gay Circle, "Nuts" I'm Aoyama Toshihiko, the leader. Toshi! We're hoping to have plenty of fun with you today. Now, for our "Nuts" specialty, "Sliding Noodles". You're so cool, Toshi! Here goes. Oh, I missed it! Oh, it's gone! Oh, no, I can't grab it. They're hopeless. Saori. It's delicious. Thank you. These are organic vegetables we've grown in class. Wow, amazing. We wanted you to eat them. So, is yours about this size? Mine's more like this. This is fine, I don't care. You're very modest for your age Do you have a boyfriend? Sorry for you... Me. Don't tell me, you? Isn't he cute? Keep your hands off. What color? What color? What color? What color? Will you shut up! Black. Oh my, so shiny. Just like seaweed! Like seaweed! Just like seaweed! Wow, amazing! Isn't this nice? I embroidered it myself. When something bad would happen at work, I'd go like this... and look at it a lot ...chairman concealed the assets... Do you have any for Himiko? According to the Tokyo Prosecutor's office, the suspect, Handa, concealed some 2 billion yen in assets by October, 2003, evading some 700 million yen in taxes. We interviewed Handa, before his arrest about his relationship with Kamimura. Kamimura testified that you were involved I know nothing. Former auditor, Kamimura, testified that the assets were concealed in subsidiaries, some abroad... Things just got a little complicated... I've never shown anyone. Don't make fun of my taste. Please, come in. Saori, I'll make us some tea. That's my newest creation. A dress to wear in my coffin. When I'm dead, I won't have to look in the mirror and regret how odd I look in a dress. It'll be my first and last dress. But I don't mind I swear I'll come back as a woman. How wonderful it will be to wear whatever I want. When I consider that, I'm not even scared to die. Just because you're a woman... What? There's still stuff you can't wear. Such as? A Bunny outfit. Bunny outfit? I decided I'd make money in that line of work. I cried and cried and made up my mind. But when I got to the interview, the manager. Looked me up and down and said, "Oh, you'll never be a Bunny". So? I didn't get the job. Ruby, you're missing the show. I got a little carried away. Lookin' good! Bring it on! Bring it on, boys! Go watch, Ruby Ruby? Ruby. Ruby! He's had a stroke. He'll be totally paralyzed. You mean in a vegetative state? Well, yes. But that's... Once he's stabilized he can leave the hospital. But we can't bring him back here. We're kicking Ruby out? We'll find another place. We're not set up to care for her here. But that's... Let's all look after her, take turns, right? Impossible, the elderly can't look after the elderly. Can't we hire a caregiver? Spending that kind of money, we'll go under. Don't you have a heart! Just listen... Listen up and get this. If we kick Ruby out now, it means this punk'll throw all of us out, when the time comes. He's pitiless. Why don't you try to reach his son? That's right, that's it! Maybe he'll come and take him. But wait, his son doesn't know Ruby's a queen. So we won't tell him! We don't even know whether Ruby'll ever speak again. If we keep our mouths shut, nobody else has to know. I suppose... Impossible. Because Ruby had the operation. Someone will have to see to her needs. What? I don't need my inheritance. What? I don't need this jerk's money. I give up my rights. Use that money. There is no... inheritance. Liar. When I bought this place, I spent my entire fortune. Unbelievable. What a mess. We might as well just shut... this place down. The truth is, when I learned I had cancer, I thought it was time to close this place down. What's that? What's with you? Why do you always do this? You made this place. Everyone came here, counting on you. Now there's a problem so you shut it down? How dare you. This man is a monster. This is exactly the way he abandoned us! That's enough. You hold your tongue. You started this. This isn't so bad, just be quiet and listen. All right. Go on. Oh, hell. I said I'm sorry I lied to you... But I was desperate then... He saw right through me. I'd rather die. I'm sorry. He's exactly right. You should shut this place down. I've always been alone... Until I met Himiko... So I don't want to shut it down. I'm still alone... Do you know anything? About this picture? No. This picture just isn't possible. The woman in the middle is my mother. My mother supposedly had nothing to do with him from when she divorced him, at 27 until she died. So what's this? That ridiculous hat. I bought it for her 40th birthday, with all the allowance I'd saved. What's a picture of her in that hat doing here? - Welcome back. - It's hot. Enjoy these. - Great. - Thanks. Iced tea? Enjoy. This tastes good. Hello, Hosokawa Painters. Me. What? I'll pay you. Would you please come? What? Himiko... threw up a lot... A lot of blood. She threw up here. So much blood. Does the smell of blood ever come out? I washed it so many times. This whole room stinks. I'm... going to have dinner with Hosokawa san. Do you think I'll get him into bed? Impossible I've seduced two straight guys before... Cut it out. He may be able to hear you. I want to feel desire. It doesn't matter what. Like a mad food craving, or "Gotta fuck him or I'll die". I want intense desire. Being here, watching him slowly die, I can't imagine wanting to live. What's the point of love? It's about desire. That's all there is. That's what I want... Yoneda, you know that Sasagawa Construction stuff... Yoneda? She quit. See? Great shot. Next time, I'll kill you. Now, scram. Please... guard that with your life. It's my client list from when I ran the bar. Contact all of them, and ask for donations. I think, that's the only way I know, I know. If that doesn't work, just shut the place down. Himiko, enough Be quiet. Funerals. Ever since, so many things happened so fast... I thought living with the others, I wouldn't have to be lonely. But I was wrong. It's like I'm just waiting for my turn, as I watch each one go... Delivery for Yamazaki san. Saori. Don't be mad. I know the timing's all wrong, but I bought it... for you. No. No. Turn around. One, two, three. That was fun. So much. Why care whether things look good or not I've betrayed the chastity I was saving for my funeral dress. Chastity's made for betrayal. I know. Let's go play! I'll let them go play nearby. No... What? No. No. I'll go take a look. It's all right, it is. No, it's not. I'm such a fool to get carried away. What idiot would want to go on a date with an old queen like me? Hey, why? Hey, wait. Wait! Saori, please! Let me go back to my room. Hadn't worn it in a while... Let me go back. Please, let me go back to my room. "I want you to get dressed to escort the ladies!" Himiko had a fit. Haruhiko called and said to get dressed quick. We all just panicked. Welcome. We're 7. Please this way. One of you get up and dance. First, a little something to eat. Excuse me, waiter. Saori. What? Will you come to the restroom with me? I've never used a ladies' room before. I've always dreamed of fixing my make-up in a ladies' room mirror. Yamazaki san. What's up? What? Let's go. Yamazaki san! You are Yamazaki san! What happened? I knew it, you were a queen. Branch manager! Let me get a good look. Stop that. Great! This is just great! Hey, this is Yamazaki san, who was the branch manager way before me. He was always so swishy, we all thought he was queer. And look, turns out he's a queen! Stop it! Isn't that right! Yamazaki san! Are you OK? Did you see that? How he fell? Like a sissy. Isn't it creepy? Like a sissy. How dare you! What the hell? Apologize. You cow! I said, apologize. No, I won't! Enough you fucking jerk! Apologize! Now! Apologize at least once! I refuse. Yamazaki san, are you OK? - Please. - Move! Apologize! Hey, Yamazaki! I'll make sure to tell the whole damned company about this! All of your former staff will be shocked! Serves you right! Apologize! I will not. You idiot! I'll slug you! I swear I'll slug you! What the hell are you doing! That bastard! - Calm down! - That bastard! Die, bastard! Calm down I can't let the bastard get away with that! Give me a break, all of you. C'mon, dance. Hey, no! What is this! How old are you? How old? You're younger than me? I thought you were older. Until we meet again 'til we see each other again. Let's not talk about why we have to part. There's only sadness. There's only emptiness. We both hurt each other and lose everything. Together we'll close the door. Together we'll erase our names. When we do our hearts will tell us why. What are you doing? Kissing. Why? Um... Masaki san. Cherries. None for me. Um... Have you ever done it with a woman? Yes... I have. How was it? Well, let's see. How to put this... It was a very... valuable, yes, a valuable experience in my life. Right after I had started teaching. She was also a teacher, 3 years older than me. What was she like? How to put this... She was exceedingly... ugly. Awful. Whenever she laughed I could see her gold teeth. For someone with gold teeth, she was a cheat about money. She got me good. This room? I'll loan it to you... but why? I'll change the sheets. So beautiful. I never noticed while I could eat them. It's almost a jewel. Eating a jewel is the height of luxury. Eat it. Eat one for me, too. I don't have... what you want, do I? Today? I can't I have stuff to do today. Please wait. I'm rude to talk while I'm brushing my teeth, but calling me on a holiday to come in to work is pretty damned rude? After the All Souls holiday, I'll come back to practice. But if you don't want to be friends with me anymore, there's nothing I can do. See ya. What? I'll help you. I'll help. Saori san, please. This is my mother, father, my oldest sister and her husband, my second oldest brother's wife... I can't remember all that. Song Book. Every year, on All Souls Night we get together and sing. This year, we're missing Himiko and Ruby, but we have a new, sweet soprano I can't wait. I'm an alto. Ruby, I swear I'll come visit you. Are cosmetics flammable trash? Inflammable. Photos burn, right? Let's let him keep the photos. These? Maybe not. Postcards. Unused? Written, just not sent. Then, they'll give your money back at the post office. Piki piki picky. In the old days, when sugar was expensive, we made "ohagi", sweet rice balls, with salt. But they tasted good at the time. Oh, a little rounder, please. Oh, you're getting the hang of it. Eggplants are cows, cucumbers are horses. What is that? A sacrifice? We don't make sacrifices to our ancestors. Indeed, the souls that return on All Souls Day ride back on these. Makes for an easier trip home. Those... gloves... I gave your mother... on her 40th birthday. She... really loved the hat you gave her. It suited her so well and she looked so happy... I took her picture. You used to see her? Yes. One day, she just appeared at the bar. After that, sometimes... We had so much fun. Your mother always dressed to the nines. Pisses me off. How dare she die without telling me? Screw "dressed to the nines". She was always piss poor. But... that's what made her so charming. Any regrets? About what? Throwing away career and family, to live as nothing but a scruffy queen? Put that way, I'd have to say no. You've no gift for questions. Then... Then... ever regret making mother suffer? Did you ever miss me? Did you ever cry because you couldn't see me? Mother... After her mind went, before she died, she thought I was you. And she was wildly happy. She was so perky. It made me sick. I won't forgive you for what you did to mother. I can't forgive you. An exceedingly appropriate conclusion. But then... in that case... may I say something? What? I... Love you. What's that! "We don't really want to fight!" "All right, last resort!" Sugimura san, see you. Be well. Ruby! What is this? Hey, did they come and get Ruby without knowing she's a queen? Yeah. But you know they'll find out You even said so. It's a gamble. A gamble. If they find out she's a queen, they may send her back here. But maybe, they'll decide to keep her. Even if it's only a chance in hell, it was worth taking. But wait, why'd you have to trick them? There's no time. If we waited for him to accept his father as a queen before he took her, Ruby would be dead. You know that better than anyone. Let Ruby die alone. That's her punishment. For abandoning her family and pleasing her own damned self. Why dump her on her son now? How much agonizing and suffering have you inflicted on her son, now? You're just scared! You wanted to dump Ruby on her son so you'd feel better. You're disgusting! Your homo egos make my skin crawl! This doesn't concern you. This is a home for gays. This is a place for gays to find happiness. This place is a lie. It's fake. Get out. I thought you were busy. Is that all? Oh, I know. Where's the estimate for the Kawasaki residence? I gave it to you. When? The other day. I mean... what is this? It's all over your face, too. Ohagi. What's "ohagi?" You can lick it, it's sweet. Thank you very much for dinner. Going home? Excuse me. Take care. I'm sure Saori will come back. We made these together. She hasn't even tried one... Songs my mother taught me. In the days long vanished. Seldom from her eyelids. Were the teardrops banished. Now I teach my children. Each melodious measure. Why are you holding back? Make some noise. You're wrong. I'm not crying for any reason you can imagine. You're really taking everything? Why? I'll sell what I can Chuck the rest. Can't I even have a keepsake, then? No. Why not? You'll move on to the next guy soon enough. Hey. Let me, to the bus stop. I had dinner with Hosokawa san. You slept with him? He was drunk so he filled me in on all the details. I felt a little jealous. Not of you... of him. Well... Guess we won't see each other again. I said, just a kiss. You have to stamp the paperwork. I'm heading home first. Long day. Shall I leave the heat on? - Bye. - Bye. We need another estimate on this one. The same place we painted this summer. Apparently they have more graffiti. Can I have a kiss? No. How 'bout me, then? I said, no. And me? You, yes. Hey, why? Because. You'll stay for tea, right? We made ohagi. It's a day to celebrate. Come. Come. Let me see the paperwork. Right. Here. WE WANT TO SEE SAORI PIKI PIKI PICKYI. Haruhiko Odagiri Joe. Saori Shibasaki Kou. Himiko Tanaka Min.
