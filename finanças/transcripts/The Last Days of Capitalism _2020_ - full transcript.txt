Oh, god. Okay. - Morning. - Hi. Hey. - Room service? - Yeah. I um, I was just surprised that you were still here. Oh. I'm happy. I was pleasantly surprised. Here I am. Um, do you mind if I use your bathroom? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. There's one at the other end of the living room, or there's a second master if you want some more privacy. I uh, I hope that you don't mind a large breakfast. I'm uh, I'm one of those annoying people that wakes up early and eats. Like some kind of rooster. Um, I'm gonna go. What? There's breakfast. Oh, that's really sweet, but I gotta get going. Right. Uh, yeah, back to uh, English? - English lit, right? - Huh? Back to Arizona University to study English lit? Yeah. Arizona, not Arizona State. Classy not trashy. That's right. - Clarissa. - Yeah. - It's Irish? - Uh, I don't know. I'd have to ask my mom. Um, okay, I'm gonna run. Uh, next time you're in town, uh, give me a ring. Three grand. Three grand to stay the rest of the day. Oh, I, I have to get back to my roommate. Three-five? Um. I'm sorry. Um. Am I being offensive? I haven't done this before. I just, I like you. And I thought with last night, you seemed pretty... Um, let me start again. Are you around today? Because I would really like to spend the rest of the day with you. And I know that you're probably busy, so I could give you something for your time. $4,000 be enough? Um. I don't know, it still feels kind of weird. You know what I do with my paintings? I um, I detach myself from them. I... I don't know, I think of them as a lump of coal, or, or a barrel of oil, the furthest thing from which they are. And I give them a price and then I let the market do its dance, free and unfettered from any emotional reaction. But what if it was you and not a painting? Let me get what I can get. Everything has a number and that number is its price. Simple. What if there is no number? Then it's known as worthless. Or priceless. You don't think things are priceless, do you? I don't. - Everything has a price? - Yeah. What about God? What uh, what number would you give for God? Um. Okay, uh, just so I can play correctly here, God in this scenario is you, or God is God? God is God. Zero. - God is worthless. - There is no God. I'm talking in the market, right? In the real world. God has no bearing on the price of things, therefore, God has no value. But what if I say there is a God, and honoring him costs money. Well, then God has a number for you, but to me, God is a zero. So everyone has their own numbers and can make up their own numbers. And thus a market is created. And those with more numbers to spend can make up higher numbers and take whatever they want. Yes, and those with lower numbers must adapt and make higher numbers and acquire power. - Except for God? - Except for God, who doesn't exist. 5,000. And your real name. Clarissa is my real name, and no anal sex. Make up another name then. Why? Because Clarissa's not your real name. It was engineered to sound vaguely like a part of your sexual anatomy and kickstart my subconscious libido. It's a brilliant piece of subliminal marketing, if you knew it or not. What do you really do for a living? I really am a painter. A painter? In the penthouse suite with a bunch of bros at a club with eight bottles of Grey Goose? I'm a really good painter, here for my brother's bachelor party, and those were his friends. Uncomplicated savages from the province of Orange County, yuck. Doctors and dentists and the like. Very grotesque sort. So you're a painter in L.A. No, New York City. You said L.A. last night. I said I used to live in L.A. and now I live in New York City, and you don't trust me.

The double vodka at 11 in the morning anxiety. Oh. You know so much, don't you? Um, some would say the exact opposite, but- - Like who? - Don't dodge. What was the answer? What could you do right now? Sleep. Drink. Fuck. Good. What else? Um. I could go to the pool and sit in a cabana and drink something cold. Good. What else? I could get on a spaceship and fly to the moon. - No you couldn't. - Why not? You don't have a spaceship. You don't have the proper training, and you probably couldn't handle prolonged zero gravity with all the toxins you've got in your system. - Oh, all right. - Yeah. All right. Really killing my vibe, you know? Now you're getting it. Kill your vibe, kill your dream. The game... The game is, what could you do right now? And what's the point of this game? I'll tell you once you give me something good. Not gonna happen. I wish we could just fuck. - No you don't. - Yes I do. What could you do right now? Um. Gamble in the casino, drive back to Arizona. Clean my bedroom, go grocery shopping. Fly to Paris, wash my car. Okay, back up one, back up one. How would you fly to Paris? On a plane. And how would you get on the plane? I, I would book my ticket on Expedia. Okay, and then what? Then, then I would book my hotel. - Which one? - I don't know. The Plaza. Okay, the Plaza for five nights in Paris. Could you really do that? Yeah, sure. - Then why haven't you? - Really? Why not? - You know why. - I don't. I. I don't. I don't have a passport. You can get one tomorrow at the Embassy. All you need is $200 and two forms of ID. Okay, fuck off. You could do it tomorrow. Spend all of my money flying to Paris and come back dead broke? - You could. - I can't. Why not? Why not? I'll give you 15 grand to stay the rest of the weekend. You can go to Paris on Monday. Are you serious? Yeah, uh, can you tell me what the rate is for a flight to Paris on Monday morning? 2,000. And also the Plaza Hotel on the Champs-Elysees? 600 euro. Yeah, my friend would like to book that, both of them, leaving on Monday and returning on Sunday. Name? Hang up. Name, miss? Miss? Name. Can you hold that for me until tomorrow morning? Thank you. What could you do right now? - Punch you. - True. My therapist used to make me do that every week. She said that it improves your IQ. The more that you believe you can do, the happier and the smarter you'll be. Uh, or it just makes you crazy. Hmm. It's all imaginary. The box that you put yourself in, the rules that you let other people give you. All the fears and the hopes and the dreams, all of it. Fake. Money's real. Maybe. - Were you serious? - Hmm? About the weekend. Yeah, I was. I am. 20. 17.5. 18. 20. And you book the flight right now. 17.5, and no anal sex. Think of what you can do with all that money. Now can I go to the moon? Mm, no, just Paris. - But I want the moon. - Sorry. - What about all that money? - What about it? How do you travel with so much money? Mm. It's a very complex system that I have. Oh yeah? I swipe my credit card with the casino concierge and he opens up a line of credit, and then when I want cash, he brings it to me. It's very, very complex. Did you get any of that? Don't be an asshole. I can't help it. What are you doing? You know, you lied, old man. Are you hungry? I'm always hungry. Pick up the phone, order whatever you want. Oh, hello? There's a guy just there. - That's the butler. - Fancy. Yes, hi. Um, can I have two cheeseburgers, onion rings, and two chocolate shakes? Thank you. Did you want something? maybe this is heaven.

Nice is always a lie. - Mean, always the truth. - That's not true. Okay, okay. Nice then. You are a wonderful kisser. That's a lie. No, that's true. - Wonderful? - Mm-hmm. Good, maybe.

Uh, oh, I got you some stuff for the day's events. - Events? - Yeah. Pool and then dinner. Oh, um, I thought that we would just be staying in. Tempting, but I thought we would get some fresh air and let the lady clean the room, and, you know. Where's dinner? The Academy Awards? Good one. I just rented that. Turns out they will let you rent anything when you play $5,000 a hand blackjack. - You wanna rent a turtle? - What? That's the most ridiculous thing I could think of off the top of my head. Don't worry, we can rent normal stuff too, like sex toys, or whatever. What about your brother? We are meeting them at the pool. I got a cabana. What? Your brother and his friends? You're here visiting your father and you wanted to hang out with a fellow artist while you were here. - A fellow artist? - Yeah, because you, studying sculpture. - You told them all that? - No. But I can if you want me to. You worry too much. Oh, well, are you gonna fix that too? Maybe. I'm gonna be a scientist, studying the brain. Sure you don't wanna be an astronaut?

Why aren't you dressed? Just daydreaming. Well, less dreaming, more action. What about Buenos Aires? Huh? Paris is so cliche. Buenos Aires is, it's romantic. It's like the Paris of South America but without all the tourists. I don't know, just a suggestion, just riffing here. Thanks, but it's uh, Paris or bust for me. - Why? - It's a secret. Mm. You're feeling better. I am. From when we first met you're happier. Maybe. Good. - What about you? - Well, it's no Paris, but it'll do. Do you mind if I skip the pool? - Why? - I'm just, I'm not feeling it. I don't really do so well around other people. - Want a Klonopin? - What's it do? One is like having two glasses of wine.

Oh, vaguely. Fuck. Okay. - Do you have a pimp? - Yeah. He has as scar and a cane, and uh, well, he beats me when I'm short. His name's Bobcat. I think that maybe I should become a pimp. Well, I'm not hiring. I'm a sole proprietorship. - That's smart. - Very. I think you would be an excellent investment opportunity, though. There's very little overhead, it's all cash, and there's no taxes, and you just, you hire the best and you let them do their thing, you just let it rip. It, it's, it's the oldest profession but it's also the oldest investment opportunity. Mm. - Baker. - What? Uh, were there prostitutes or bakers first? People were having sex before they invented fire. Yeah, but were they selling it? Undoubtedly. But I think now, never have you been, like, more vital than you are at the present moment? - Vital? - Vital. What does that mean? Vital? - It means- - No, no, no, yeah, I know what vital means. Please do not explain it to me like I'm some desert bunny trash. I wouldn't think of it, that was- - Why am I vital? Every guy should feel, I don't know, as free as I feel right now. I can say whatever I wanna say, I can be who I am, who I really am. Nobody loves anybody and nobody's trying to manipulate anybody's emotions, and I don't know, there's no like, buried resentments or hidden maneuvers and tactics and shit. I think the French have this right, and that's probably the only time I'll ever say that. But I think that sex should be separate from a relationship. If I wanna fuck my wife, great. But if I fuck somebody else then I can just be with my wife instead of being miserable trying to bag the old ball and chain for like, the 2,000th time. I think it's, it's more natural... No, scratch that, it's more monogamous than monogamy. Seeing a prostitute's like, the first class of monogamy. - You're married? - Fuck no. No, this is in theory. In theory. What about you not in theory? Wow, okay. Jesus, doctor. Um. It's not just I who is frustrated, it's the whole current epoch of my male brethren, right? These, these are confusing times right now. - Are you always like this? - Like what? Controlling. Just bad genes. Well, I don't mind it. Ugh, sorry. Okay, I'm taking notes. Um. Where was I? Prostitute, monogamy, first class. Uh, okay. How, what I... I think that... Okay. I'm a nice guy, and I think that I'm pretty fairly well adjusted, et cetera, et cetera, all that. And on some level, I wanna fall in love. That knock you down, pound you out, wake up in Paris kinda love, but let's face it, that's not real. Not really. And more on that later. The point is that that idea makes me what some people would call as like, a bit of a playboy. But the problem is, I have taste, right? - Mm-hmm. - I like and enjoy a very particular type of woman. I like somebody who's beautiful and intelligent and ambitious. ...and... Those type of women require energy and attention and money, and they wanna know that there's an endgame to the whole thing. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, sex is more than sex or else it's empty and shallow and brings out the worst, animalistic part of ourselves. - You are very quick. - Oh, for a woman? Wow. And next we're gonna talk about your defensiveness. Well you know, I run in very smart circles and memorize a few things. Now back to your modern male bullshit, whatever. Um, okay. I... it's... There's probably a... No, there's like, probably 100 million in this very country alone, right? Like poor, just nice guys, nice guys who wanna get laid on a regular basis but who don't... want to engage in the dark arts of like, emotional forgery and passive sociopathy. What happens is, porn, masturbation, aloneness, and it's a closed loop that begins to cave in on itself and it's like a journey to the center of your mind. And my entire generation are a bunch of frustrated dudes that are just jerking off and talking to themselves and we need you. We need you. We need you to tell us that it's okay to pay for sex. That, that, that it's just sex, and that you're happy to take the payment. Don't feel guilty, it's only supply and demand. But the demand side needs to know that it's moral in order for it to thrive in this country. It's a very Christian nation, and so we need, we need, you know, like a, we need an ad campaign, we need, um... We need, we need George Clooney staring straight down the barrel of the camera in black and white, very serious, very classy, saying, "I would argue at this point that seeing a prostitute is more moral than burning coal, and it's definitely more moral than buying anything from China. And it's definitely, certainly more moral than our first-world bourgeois addiction to the cocaine." Get George Clooney to single handedly legalize prostitution. Mm, set us free, my brother. Let the market decide. Let your heart decide. Let yourself loose, and, and, and love, you know? Love yourself. Love yourself and love your wife and love your prostitute. God bless America.

You haven't made a friend in 20 years? - Not a real one. - Why? Work, money. I don't believe you. What a weird thing friends are. Just the word, friends. Friends. So then why don't you forget about money? I can't. Why? I don't know. I blame my father. Sure, take the easy way out. That's what fathers are for. What's your middle name?

Says who? What do you really see though, when you look at me? Um, I see a man surrounded by things. Uh, a man who's made the acquisition of these things his main goal. And I think he's just starting to realize that these things are only making it worse because now he's tricked himself into thinking that these things are a part of him, the same as his kidneys or his liver or his heart. And I think it's his heart that he's almost convinced himself that he's forgotten. But he can still feel it, hear it. Like a faint echo in the back of a dark cave, not quite sure where it's coming from. And I think that this is really the root of his sadness. That he decided long ago to go against his heart, against what God has given him, in order to force himself into a system whose sole goal is the acquisition of more and more things. Why does he do it? Because he fears death. What's gonna happen to him? It's easy. He dies the same as everyone else. And what about all my things? Mm, they die. That's impossible. No, even your paintings in the end die. Gone in the next great flood when this sand turns back into ocean floor. Well, then what hope is there for any of us? Now. Oh.

Remind me never to put anything up my nose again. Jesus. Oh, no. You gotta get up. Why? Because if you stay down, you'll think you belong there. We'll never get out of here. My dad used to say that. Come on. Did he ever consume massive amounts of cocaine and champagne? Well, then you just gotta get higher. Let's go. I don't wanna do any drugs. I know what you need. - How do you have- - Excitement. Adventure. How do you, how do you have all this energy? I don't know. Don't you just wanna stay in the bed all day? Do you trust me? Do you trust me? With what? With your life. Yeah. - Fuckin', yes. - Right answer. Okay, come on. - Let's go. - Mm. I have to get out of here, please. Mm. Mm. - Come on. - It's Sunday? Yeah. - The 22nd? - Sure. You wanna have some real fun? Please! Please, please, please, please, please. Okay. All right, move. Okay. There. What's this? 10 grand. And in return? We watch a movie tonight. No deal. I fucking hate movies. You didn't let me finish. After we have an afternoon full of action, adventure, and international intrigue, and I double your money. Okay, I'm listening. We are gonna day trade the yen. What the what? - It's the Japanese currency. - How? - Broker in Hong Kong. - But it's Sunday. It's Monday in Tokyo. Are you ready? What do I have to do? How many of those can you take? 37. And these little guys, two of those and a cocktail and it is lights out, bucko. - A regular pharmacist. - Mm, call me doctor. And don't try to control me. Okay. Take out your phone and type in "The value of the yen versus the dollar." - 120 to one. - Okay. So if you think it's going to go up, meaning that you think one dollar is gonna buy more than 120 yen, then you wanna buy long. Or the call, if you think it's gonna go down then you wanna buy short. What's the price of the call option? I'm completely lost. Okay, the call will buy you 100 yen for the price of one. So if you buy at 120 and it goes down to 118, how much did you just lose? - Two cents? - Two dollars. What? How does two cents become two dollars? Because you just bought 100 but only paid for one. That's... - That's fucked. - Not if you win. Are you ready? For what? Okay, grab the phone. You wanna get in at the open before everything goes to shit. Are you ready? What's the worst that could happen? You lose my 10 grand. Mm, I'd have to watch a movie for free. Well, there are risks in this life. Time's a wastin'. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. Ask for an outside international line. Can I have an outside international line? Okay. 3, 679, 2284. - 679? - 2284. Okay, it's ringing. Hello. - It's a bank? - Okay. Ask for Maxwell Kane, and when he picks up call him Max-Max. Maxwell Kane, please. Okay, it's ringing. Hi, Max-Max? Uh- - Tell him that you're with The Monk and that we wanna trade options on the yen. Um, I'm with The Monk and we wanna trade options on the yen today. How much. - How much? - You tell me. Call or short? One second, Max-Max. Okay, please stop fucking around. - What should I do? - Pick a color. Red or black. This isn't roulette, it's math. No, no, no, no, no, this is roulette disguised as math, all right? Up or down, long or short, red or black. I want call options, Max-Max. Can you give me some call options? How much? Um, 10,000. He's laughing. It's because 10,000 will only get you a couple hundred if it goes up two cents. You gotta bet big to win big. Ask him, ask him what the credit line is at? Um, what's his credit line at? 20 million? Okay, your call. But market is gonna jump off, so chop chop. Shit. Uh. 500? That only gets you a couple thousand. Uh, 1 million? Mm, only gets you about 10 grand. 2 million? Why don't we win big? Uh. um, 3 million. I want 3 million on call options, Max-Max. Give me 3 million. Thank you. - Ooh-wee. - Oh my god! Oh my god!

Why? - It's your bet. There's 3 million dollars riding here! No, it's, it's not moving. That's probably not gonna move for a little while. The markets don't really start to move until 10. Well, what about all that jumping off shit? That was dramatic tension. - What time is it there? - Six. Oh, Jiminy Christmas. It is bath time. No, I can't, I can't.

Let's go to Paris. When? Tomorrow. God bless us, everyone. Hey, what's your favorite restaurant in Paris? Uh, Cafe Julians on the River. I wanna sit at Cafe Julians and drink champagne. I thought you didn't drink champagne? Well, when in Paris. Can you check and see what time the flight boards? I don't have the tickets. They're on my phone. I thought you threw your phone over the balcony? They sent up a new one. It should be on the nightstand. Ow. It's locked. 2323. Okay, it says the flights are. I asked what time the flight boards Oh. Uh. Um. - 4:30. - Great. Pre-flight cocktail. - You want one? - Sure. Super. Okay. My name's Rebecca Moore. My mother has stage 3 stomach cancer and we live in Reno. No. This will help pay for her chemo. Don't! What's your real name? Rebecca Moore. I live in Reno. You know the interesting thing about these suites? Is that there's actually two safes. There's the smaller everyday safe in the closet, but then there's the heavy hitter. It's a little bit tricky to find, though, 'cause it's a floor safe. Your real name. What's your real name? Hello. Can I get you to send 100 grand cash up? Thanks very much. Who are you? - David Carthridge. - Where do you live? Doorman building on Central Park. What do you really do? Commodities broker for a large private equity firm specializing in energy, specifically crude. - Oil? - Black gold. Was? My father died. This is his funeral. What about your brother's bachelor party. Those guys you met work for me. I brought them out here to celebrate. - Your father's death? - The execution of his estate. Meaning? Meaning a Caribbean bank deposited $100 million into my bank account. It's funny how one minute 50 grand can seem like a fortune, and the next. My name's Melissa Price. Where are you from, Melissa Price? Jean. One of those little desert towns you pass on your way from L.A. How old are you? 25. It was nice. How much longer can you do this? 10 years. - And then what? - And then I'll own two apartments in Phoenix and live off the rent. What is that? 50 grand a year? My dad didn't own a fund. You know, the day that my father died, there were screams of joy in his office building. And I just sat there, having just learned that my father's atrial wall had exploded, and I listened to adults scream with joy. One day he ruled over 1,000 people and the next he didn't, because it wasn't real. I mean, how could something real fall apart in just one second? His whole life was just some hologram that was created by lots and lots of cash, and the only thing real that he might've experienced in his whole life was dying. That's a good story. But the truth is, that while he was alive he did everything he wanted to, because he could, because he had more money and more power than anyone. They'll hate you for it, but who cares what they think? Because at the end of the day, everyone's dead, and the only thing that matters is how you live. Your father won and they lost. Jesus died penniless and he still gets top billing in every drawer in this town. Jesus died hung by nails for days. The rest is a fairytale they tell the poor to keep them happy and poor and away from the rich. Melissa Price, 25, there is no God, there is no love, there is no joy, just cold hard cash. David Carthridge, poor little rich kid who gives a hooker 50k so he can pretend he has a soul, pretend like this whole weekend wasn't about one thing. Fucking me. That's not true. I didn't ask for any of this money, I just have it. And it attracts people, they're obsessed with it. All around me are people that will devote their entire lives to making as much money as I was given. They'll destroy themselves, they'll destroy each other, they'll destroy anything to get it. I didn't have to destroy myself for it, I already had it, so I got to keep my soul. It's unfair, but it's true. How long have you been up here? What? You've been up here thinking long before I arrived. 20 days. Why? - Because my dad died. - And? I realized that my life is the same hologram that his was. Oh. So this was a spiritual journey. Holed up above Las Vegas to find something real with a woman you paid. This was a consume everything, I came to ease the pain the only way I know how for 20 days, but the pain was still there so you had to consume something else, me. But you fucked up. You decided to feel something rather than consume something. Tell me your story. I'm paying for it. You were what, 23 when we went into Iraq? - Yeah. - Working for your father? Mm-hmm. Just out of some fancy school. Yeah. You wore $2,000 suits, had a secretary, ate stake dinners twice a week. But deep down you felt like an artist, a painter. Maybe. What happened to the price of oil after we went in? - It tripled. - Did you celebrate? - I was 25. - Be brave. If not now, when? I bought a... Bought an apartment, uh, in South Beach. Did you wait a week? Or was it the very day we invaded? You had the guys down for the weekend, sun, cocaine, women. Hundreds of thousands of people were gonna die and you knew it. But not you, and not any of your friends. Just the poor fuckers living on the wrong kind of sand. I was 10 when my dad died in Iraq. I was 16 when my mom finally gave in. I never was very good at school. I met a man, came to Vegas with him. I wanted to be a singer, I was gonna have my own show at Caesars and then a record contract in L.A. But things get hard. And someone gives you $300 one night and away you go. Up here you get to make up your own story. But down there, your story gets branded on you the moment you're born. There is no power in that, only struggle.
