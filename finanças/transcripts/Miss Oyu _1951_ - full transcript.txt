Do you think she's really nice, Aunt? Even a carpenter as refined as yourself will be surprised at her beauty. I wish you'd finish with all these presentations and finally decide. That's for me to say. - I'm just going for a walk. - They're already here though. How beautiful and fresh the young leaves look. Shinnosuke, they've arrived, haven't they? You were right. - So you saw her, then? - Yes. - If only I'd seen her before. - So you like her. You do know which one she is, don't you? Yes, the one in the jacket. No! That's Miss Oyu... ...the elder sister who married into the Kayukawa family. She was very anxious to see her younger sister's prospective husband. Don't confuse them, or that would be awful! You must be tired from all the travelling. Not at all. It's wonderful to be in Kyoto again after so long. Greet your hosts, Oshizu. It's an honour to meet you. Oshizu, today we'll conduct formal introductions. Your nephew seems to be a very nice gentleman. He lost his parents at an early age which made him rather awkward socially. - He has to meet more ladies! - I agree. But he said he hasn't met the one he wishes to marry yet. I wonder what he thinks of Oshizu. Does he like her? When he first saw you, he mistook you for Oshizu. - Me? - Yes. He just stood, staring at you. Good day to you! Welcome back, madam. - Welcome home. - Good day. Welcome home, madam. Good day, madam. Welcome back. Good day. - Sorry we're late. - You've done well. As it got so late, we decided to stay at Yae's in Kyoto. She sends her regards. I see. - So, how did it go? - He seems very nice. Altogether, a very kind and thoughtful gentleman. As a husband, I think he'd be very attentive towards Oshizu. - Really? - What a relief, don't you think, Oshizu? Seems we've found a suitable match for you. Your brother would like to hear your opinion, Oshizu. Thank you for all your help, sister. That's a clever way to divert the conversation! His aunt told me that when he first saw us arrive, he mistook me for you. Apparently, he was just standing there, staring at me. Is that so? Even though I deliberately wore these muted colours so you'd shine. Even in muted colours, sister, you catch everyone's eye. Don't be so silly. Oyu. - Good day. - Good day. Welcome. The master is in the store. - Welcome. - Good day. What's with you? It's high time you made a decision! I know. If the last one didn't appeal to you, then I give up on you! I don't know... What do you dislike about her? I've waited this long. I just don't know if she's the one. Is there anyone who meets your expectations? There is. Then tell me who it is. I'd rather discuss the business instead. Can we approach Miss Oyu Kayukawa... ...to patronise our business? - Why, to buy from you? - Yes. She seems to be a very refined woman with exquisite taste. - What's her husband like? - I think he died years ago. - So she's alone? - Yes. If you wish to make her acquaintance... ...we can attend one of her koto concerts. - I'd like to welcome sir and madam. - Good day. It's a pleasure to welcome you. We're right in the middle of a performance... ...but please enter. She's exquisitely dressed. And she's burning incense. It is as though the storm is scolding... ...the foot of the mountain. And the petals of cherry trees Fall like snow. The moment moves me To compassion. The rains of spring arrive. And fall like tears. The blossom falls like rain. It is a world full of regret. Please excuse us. Good day. Thank you so much for inviting us to your concert. I'm delighted you came. - Thank you for visiting us the other day. - It was my pleasure. Please, have a seat. I must look rather strange to you in this 10th-century Heian costume. Not at all. You look very beautiful. The manners and customs of the Heian Era are so refined. And the interior decor matches perfectly. I'm very fond of reading classical Heian Era literature. Today was a special public performance... ...but really I just wanted the chance to wear this costume. If my music master could hear me, he'd be furious... ...but the koto is merely an accessory! Aunt, didn't my mother dress like this when she was young? She did. My mother died when I was very young. How old were you when she passed away? I was four. Oh, such a tender age. I never knew what she looked like... ...but she was from Kyoto and was presented at the Imperial Palace... ...so, as a little boy, I always imagined her dressed as you are now. I was overjoyed when I first saw your costume. I understand that your mother was indeed a very beautiful woman. Yes, she was very pretty... ...but nothing compared to you, Miss Oyu. Oh, you can't possibly say that. Please help yourself. Oh, nice to meet you. Thank you for visiting. This is the master of the family. Thank you for the kindness you showed Oyu and Oshizu the other day. We've been wonderfully entertained today. Good, good. Please excuse us, we're going to watch the dancing. Of course. Just look how beautiful your mother looks. Come and sit here with me. Welcome home. Welcome back, madam. - Welcome home, madam. - Good day. Good day, madam. Aunt? Would I be allowed to marry her? Who, Miss Oyu? I've been waiting this long for a woman like Oyu. What are you talking about? If you want a woman like that, then you'll have to run away with her! The senior members of the Kayukawa family are very strict. Also, there's her young son to take care of, from her first marriage... ...and she's responsible for his upbringing. So she has to stay there for the rest of her life? - But she lives a life of luxury. - Luxury isn't everything. Once a woman has married... ...she can't leave her husband's family without their consent. Even if she could leave, how am I supposed to tell them? We've arranged for you to marry Oshizu. So we should just elope, then? Don't even joke about it, nephew! Is that you, Miss Oyu? What's wrong? Can she rest a while? Please... I'm so sorry. Otsugi should be along shortly. Is it heatstroke? I have a friend who lives very close, let's go. - Go back to the store. - Yes, sir. - Many thanks. - Not at all. Oh, Mr Serihashi? - Can you help us? - Is she unwell? - That's right. Please help. - Come through. Come on. - Sorry for bothering you. - Not at all. There you go. Is your heart pounding? If it's heatstroke, then loosen the ties on her clothes. Loosen her clothes to get some cool air in. - I'll go and fetch the doctor. - You do that. Where can she have got to? Just leave her to rest a while and she'll be fine. - Thank you so much. - Thank you for coming. All the best. That's strange, she didn't come home. I wonder where she could be. - I'm worried. - Me, too. I must have been sleeping. Are you awake? I'm sorry for having caused you so much trouble. What happened to Otsugi, I wonder. I went to look for her, but we must have missed each other. She'll be worried. I must get home immediately. - Are you all right? - I'm fine, thanks to you. When I saw your face back there... ...it was like seeing the Buddha coming to save me from hell. Where were you going? I was thinking of stopping by your house. My house? This morning, your Aunt Osumi came by... ...to say that you'd refused Oshizu's hand in marriage. Is that true? Do you dislike Oshizu that much? No... I don't dislike her. Well, if you don't dislike her, then will you accept her? I would very much like Oshizu to marry a man as kind as you. Amongst our siblings, Oshizu is the closest to me. Every day, she comes along to lift my spirits when I'm feeling down. If Oshizu must get married... ...then I'd prefer her to be as near to me as possible. I'm sure, if she married you, you'd let me see her often. Listen... Well... ...I would do anything you asked of me if it were to make you happy. Well, if that's true, then please say you'll marry Oshizu. Very well. Will you accept her? Yes. Madam, your elder sister has arrived back home. Really? - Welcome home. - Good evening. Please, this way. Good evening. We've been worried sick about you. Luckily I bumped into Mr Serihashi, and he took good care of me. Please, this way. Listen, Oshizu... Oshizu! Oshizu! What a funny girl. - Please, do come in. - I must get back. - Really? You won't have some tea? - I'll see you again. I wanted to talk to you about Oshizu's future. - There's trouble brewing. - Why is that? So far I've left it in your hands... ...but the whole family is opposing it. What do you mean? They think you should put a halt to the proceedings. That sounds like nonsense. They think he's somewhat frivolous. A person who knows no frivolity in life can know little about the world. - What's your opinion? - I'm happy with the way it's going. - Is that not enough, then? - But I can't make this decision alone. As her elder brother, you're the head of the Kosobe family. If you give your consent, then that will suffice. But even Oshizu herself hasn't given us a straight answer. Oshizu... ...you know that some of the family disapprove of your engagement? Tell me, what do you think? Nothing is decided yet... ...but if you remain silent on this matter, then you are at fault. You told me yourself that you liked him. What do you think of him, though, sister? He's a fine gentleman. I think so every time I see him. He's not my future husband, so I shouldn't try to sway your opinion... ...but I don't think you'll find a better match. Once sisters get married, they become like strangers to each other. I would hate for anyone to take you away from me... ...but with him, I'd feel like I'd gained a brother... ...rather than lost my dear sister. You see, Oshizu? Why won't you tell me if you want to proceed with the arrangements? If you want to proceed, then your elder brother will respect your wishes. You do, don't you? Oh, you make a beautiful bride. I pray for your luck and happiness. Good night, madam. Maybe I should say a few words as your new husband... But... Forgive me but there is something I must tell you. I have a great favour to ask of you. What is it? When I agreed to be your bride... ...I made a firm resolution. What resolution? Please, let us observe nothing more than the formalities of our marriage. I have pierced my poor sister's heart... ...and it would be unbearable for her if I gave myself to you. For as long as we live, I will be content with a symbolic marriage. I want you to bring some happiness into my sister's life. Do you know what you are saying? I understand full well what I'm proposing. Until now, Oyu has always opposed any of my suitors proposing marriage... ...under the pretext of not wanting to lose me. But this time, she said... ...that if I married you, it would be like inheriting another brother. Oshizu... And that's not all. Since that day she first met you... ...her eyes have shone with such radiance. Surely you're just imagining all this? No. I believe that once one is married one must respect that commitment... ...despite whatever problems there may be along the way. I understand how you feel for your sister... ...but you can't treat me so heartlessly. And surely... Oyu herself wouldn't want that? But I know you have feelings for my sister. Though you have accepted me as your wife... ...it is only so you can remain close to Oyu. Not at all. Please, don't hide your feelings from me. Very well, I won't hide the way I feel about her. But I must think of her only as a sister. And it will be even harder for you to come to terms with. I could never steal from my sister the one that she loves. If I hadn't married you... ...then there would be no bridge between the two of you. I married you so you would treat me as your younger sister. So you will sacrifice yourself for Oyu for the rest of your life? No... my sister sacrifices herself far more. Though she may have feelings for someone... ...her life is bound by strict rules. All I ask of you is to make my sister happy. If you are truly in love with Oyu... ...please do as I ask of you. Oshizu, are you saying you're prepared to live like a nun? Yes. I don't care what happens to me. Oshizu, don't these young leaves remind you of anything? Weren't the leaves like this last spring... ...when you first met and married Shinnosuke? It's strange to think how one's destiny is shaped. Indeed. Those spring leaves will always be in your memories, Oshizu. Yes. Shall we stop soon along the route for some refreshment? Let's carry on, it's just a little further. Let's go as far as the temple. The maple leaves there are particularly beautiful. My feet won't carry me. - Help her, dear. - Very well. - I'll carry you. - Thank you. You're as light as a feather cushion! Isn't she? I often carry her when we're walking in the mountains. This is wonderful. I should have complained of tiredness much sooner! When you left me. I had thought. To cut the reeds. That line the desolate Beaches at Naniwa. I yearn more and more. The reeds are agitated. I didn't cut them in the end. Our paths then separated. Along the desolate Beaches of Naniwa. One must not linger in this place. From Naniwa to Mount Asaka... Let's see if you can hold your breath until I give you a signal. Yes, madam! Oh, that's no good, I can feel your breath. Let me try this. Ready? Hold it in, hold it in. Hold it... This time, you must really try not to laugh. Ready? Ready. Ticklish? Does that tickle? I said you're not allowed to laugh! Oh, what a happy couple! Please, carry on, don't mind me. It's lovely to see a married couple so in love. It must be hard on you being with such a pair, eh? She's no idea who's who amongst the three of us. When the maid returns, Oshizu... ...you can act playfully with Shinnosuke. Come and sit closer to Shinnosuke, show us how much you're in love. I already told him I don't like doing that. Sit closer together. - Please don't, sister. - Sit closer, go on. Sit there. - Quickly, before the maid gets back! - No! That's far enough, sister! The joke's over. Oh, you sound just like a little girl! Surely, you'll be expecting soon, won't you? I wonder what Oshizu's child will look like. I have no idea! What a strange girl she is! Oh? Where's Oshizu? - Wasn't she with you? - No. Can you hear the frogs singing? Listen, Shinnosuke... ...are you getting along well with Oshizu? Yes... fine. She rarely loses her temper like that. I'm sure it's nothing. The maid simply misread the situation. There was no reason for Oshizu to get so worked up. I wonder where she's gone. I'll go and have a look. Is that you? What's wrong? I have done exactly as you wanted till now, Oshizu... ...but are we really doing the right thing? Why do you ask? I'm worried about you. Tell me truly how you feel. Do you want our marriage to be real? If so, then we can respect Oyu as our sister, but together we can... Just make my sister happy. My feelings about the situation remain absolutely unchanged. That's not how it seems to me. I'm finding it very hard to carry on like this. One day, my sister will again be free... ...and then you will have no need of me. Till then, let us remain as we are. You're saying that you will leave me the day she becomes free? All I wish for... ...is to be treated as your little sister. Please don't reject me! Oshizu? Yes? Where have you been? One of the maids said that a cuckoo was singing, so I went to listen. I was worried about you. They say it's very rare to hear it. It's calling. No, that's a night raven, isn't it? I do find it rather chilly here at night. Want me to join you? We can sleep under the same blanket. You should be saying that to your husband not me! Good night. And when exactly was this? It happened some time before Oshizu married Mr Serihashi. And what did Oyu say? Madam said she had suffered from heatstroke... ...and spent the night alone convalescing at the ikebana master's house. So how did you learn that she was with Shinnosuke? Well... when I took round a thank-you present to the master... ...he said that they had left together to go to the Kosobe household. - Won't you come in? - I've no time. - I have to check on my business. - Oh, I see. - Best wishes to my father-in-law. - Of course. Good bye. Good bye. Welcome home, madam. Welcome back, madam. Your son has been taken suddenly ill. Good day, madam. Hajime? What's happened? I've just returned home. What ails him? He's dying! - Oyuki! Oume! - Yes, sir? Quickly, go and fetch the doctor! Go immediately, go! Are you in pain? Be brave, my child! Good day. Come in. Where's Oshizu? She's just gone out. I heard that Oyu has had to return to her family village. - Is that true? - Yes. Her son passed away. Rumour has it, that wasn't the only reason. You know what I'm referring to? I've come to find out what's been going on between the two of you? I don't know what you mean. People say that you've fallen for each other. I pity Oshizu. She can't be forced to accept such a situation. Who's spreading these rumours? Members of both the Kayukawa and the Kosobe families... ...have sent their people round to inform me. It's just lies. Just lies. Are you not seeing a little too much of each other? Her being sent back home doesn't fix anything. If you don't show a little more discretion, you'll become a social disgrace. Probably nobody's told you directly... ...but it's the real reason for your return. Even if your son hadn't died, you'd still have been summoned home. If you settle down here, then I'll let you have your old life back. But you're not the kind of woman to settle down at home. So, I have a proposition for you. What if you were to get remarried? In fact, it was Yae who suggested you should be free of your in-laws. She said she has an offer of remarriage for you. It's from a Mr Miyazu, a sake merchant in Fushimi. Apparently, he fell in love with you the year before last... ...when he saw you at a tea ceremony at Daikaku Temple. Well, he says that if you accept... ...then he will offer you a life of luxury. You've been told this already? The other day, I went to Kyoto to see Yae... ...and she wants to talk to you soon because of the situation. What do you think? I believe you when you said you remained pure... ...but even so, things could still turn out badly for you, you see? It's for your own good. If you accept this proposition, then all the fuss will die down. Anyway, sister, you now have your freedom. It would be unthinkable for you to go back to being cloistered again. At last, you can follow your heart's wishes. If our brother won't accept you back in his house... ...you are always welcome here. The three of us can live in harmony, can't we? Even if I accepted your offer, the gossip would only get worse. And it would be awful for you. All the rumours and gossip would simply never stop. I wonder if my father took care of my son's ashes. I would like to visit his grave, at the very least. Oshizu, will you accompany me? And then we could go up to the Konpira Temple. Shall we all go together, my dear? We can spend the night in Tadotsu... ...and visit the grave the following day. And then... I don't care anymore. Don't say that, sister. Miss Oyu, you must be exhausted. Not at all, I'm fine. It's so hot. Oshizu, you should offer to wipe your husband's brow in the bath. Could you bring some wet flannels? Oshizu... ...is there a problem in your relationship? No. Please don't hide anything from me. Something's going on. Married couples don't behave like this. I don't know what it is, but it's not normal. Something's wrong, isn't it? If you're finding it hard to cope, then I'll give you all my support. Tell me. Has he found someone else? It's nothing. We're getting along fine. Then why are you in tears, if there's nothing to worry about? You can tell me. You're my only worry now. Only worry? Does that mean you're going to marry that sake merchant? Or go elsewhere? Sister! I couldn't bear it if you died! Sister! I'm not going to die. You must marry my sister. What are you saying? I knew from the very beginning that you liked Shinnosuke. I'd made up my mind even before we got married. You couldn't be together at that time. I got married so you'd be able to see each other. I wanted to be a bridge between you. But you're both... No. We are not husband and wife... ...but more like siblings. It was impossible for me to take the one you loved, sister. I told Shinnosuke everything the night of the wedding. I wanted to be treated as his sister not his bride. Even now, we are like siblings. And now, there is a way that you can both be together. All I want... All I want is my sister's happiness. That's all I want in this world. I never intended to create a situation like this. No... ...you didn't force me to do anything, sister. I made the decision on my own. Sister, I know that it was insane, but I don't feel constrained in any way. - Silence! - No. For you, I am ready to live my whole life in the shadows. Lies! Ridiculous lies! You must love Shinnosuke. If you continue this charade, then I fear for the future. Your relationship can be re-established. Please, from now on you must live as man and wife, Shinnosuke. Shinnosuke? If you don't listen to me, then we won't remain as sisters... ...and I won't see you ever again. Dinner is served. Isn't there one more? Madam said she had to attend to some business. She boarded the seven o'clock boat for home. You've made the right decision. It's the right thing to do. He's an influential man, he'll take good care of you. I have one favour to ask of you. I don't wish to stay here until the wedding. Let me go to Yae's in Kyoto to prepare myself. Of course. That's probably a good idea. I'll leave for Kyoto immediately. Immediately? What, today? Yes. I'm leaving. I have no wish to see Shinnosuke and Oshizu. Brother... Please give this kimono and the box of accessories... ...to Oshizu as something to remember me by. Very well. I'll take care of it. I wonder what my sister Oyu is doing now. It's been almost three years since we moved to Tokyo... ...and not a single letter from her. Where is this Lake Ogura, anyway? Somewhere near Yodo. I think she'd be overjoyed to learn that you're expecting a baby. I'm off to work. Come home as soon as you can. You look pale. You have to look after yourself. Especially in your state. If you're going to inform her family, do it sooner rather than later. Good bye. My love... would you open the screen door? It's the season of the young leaves once again. On that day... if my sister hadn't accompanied me... ...we'd never have gone through these tribulations. You have always shown me such kindness... ...and you have always made me so happy. But you still belong to my sister. How can you say that now? However much I tried to erase... ...the image of my sister... ...I found I could not. As for me... ...I am simply here in my sister's stead. That's not true! I have come to love you... I love you now. Think about the beautiful child that unites us. If only... If only you'd belonged to me. Darling... my sister's kimono... ...bring it over here. I never realised how heavy this kimono was. Many thanks. Let's move over there. - That was magnificent. - Thank you. - Wonderful. - Thank you so much. Madam seems to lead a very refined life... ...but she inspires compassion in others. She's a wife in name only. One never sees her spouse. Your husband never attends your concerts. He does not share my interests. But I'm lucky that you all come and visit me. I enjoy it so much that I forget about everything else in my life. Is there something wrong? I thought I could hear a child crying over there in the garden. You're right. He's crying so loudly, something must be wrong. If you please... ...go and see what it is. I wonder if he's been abandoned here. To Miss Oyu... ...from Shinnosuke. Is it from someone you know? "I have just glimpsed you from afar and I am reassured. "Here is the reason I have written to you. "After childbirth, Oshizu weakened... "...and she died after giving birth to this child. "I do not wish to give Oshizu's child to someone I do not know. "As I have no intention of remarrying... "...I would like you to look after the child. "I know that this request may seem unreasonable... "...and I should have presented the child to you in person. "But I made a firm resolution never to see you again. "I implore you, I beg of you... "...on behalf on Oshizu and myself... "...united and forever together... "...to look after this child with tender love". I have just received a beautiful child. On this moon-viewing night... ...it could be a gift from the Moon Goddess herself! A beautiful child. A wonderful child. Good boy, good boy. Please... ...won't you play something in honour of my child? Of course! You have left me. I had thought. To cut the reeds. That line the desolate Beaches of Naniwa. More and more. More and more Do I yearn. It was never destined To be this way... THE END
