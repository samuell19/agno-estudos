Our small jobs were okay. Why did you have to mess with him? Why did you take this risk? Why? Don't cry. Don't cry. Think of some idea else.. ..those people will kill you also along with me. Yes -Why? You want that you should get married no? What are you saying brother? The priest if booked. The marriage hall is booked. I only need to find a bride. You will find a bride don't worry. You also want to have children. Children? I have already spoken to.. ..convent schools for admissions. What are you saying? And if your children are orphaned before they are born then? Orphaned before they are born? What is wrong with you my brother? Because if you don't come up with an idea, then that Jangia. Not Jangia, Jogiya Alright Jogiya. Then that Jogiya will shoot you,.. ..me and that orphanage. And your kids who will be orphaned before their birth.. You're laughing? Don't talk about the kids. The kids are not even born yet. Where will they live? Elder people can't.. ..find space to live in Mumbai. Don't cry. Don't. - Don't get me tensed please. Please give me an idea. I beg you. This is the last time. Please Nattu. Alright. Come on. Listen to me very carefully. Listen carefully. I have conned one NRI person at the airport. He is distantly related to some Chaudhary family.. ..whom he is visiting as a guest. His name is Sanjay Shastri. Oh really? - Right. He is a complete buffoon. He met me on Mumbai airport and.. ..asked me to take him to Mumbai. Here take this entire history of the Chaudhary family. I was going to go there and impersonate Sanjay Shastri.. ..and con them off 50-60 lakhs. But what to do! Each cap has the name written of the person who wears it. Now you go there as Sanjay Shastri and con them. Stay away from Jogiya for a month and be loaded with money. But where is that buffoon? Come here. See there he is eating grass. I will keep feeding him grass till the time you come back. Are you ready to take his place? I'll go. -Then why are you crying? Listen dear. This plan is a little difficult. Did you understand? Hey Natwar. Let it go, Natwar I am scared. You just chill. Get into that house and get good money. This is the Chaudhary villa. Okay. So rich people live here. I.. ..will go there as their relative. In that family there must be a typical, innocent mother? There is one stuck-up father like a snake without fangs. What are you doing all by yourself? Can't you see I am playing cricket. So did you have a good time with your illustrious sons? What are they not yours? There are 3 brothers. They earn well.. ..in their business. Correct? The eldest, Dilip, is very honest. - Sit here. The other two are unhappy with him. First tell me the problem. Same problem every year. First it is Diwali and then the bonus. That is your right. The moment they start crying. The charity begins. The middle brother's clever mind. Works in gambling and trading. He fought with his Father and still lives in the same house. Father, this Dilip brother has pampered the workers too much. Bonus! Holidays! One hand the business is suffering. Tell him sorry we can't work with brother Dilip. This business of mine has been taken care of by Dilip. No matter what he is, he is very principled. Not a gambler like you. You will sell me too. You will make me stand on the roof and auction me. He will kick me and say that if.. ..I fall on my back then Rs 100.. ..and if I fall on my face then Rs 200. I don't play such small games. - What?! Wow. What a strange house? And the youngest stammers! I say you do that between all of us. What had happened between India and Pakistan, brother? Cricket match. -What had happened in 1947? Partition. -Partition. Both sisters-in-law are jealous of each other. The younger one argues with the mother-in-law, Sanjay. My god. Very weird family. Everyone has a problem. Hey Natwar. I am scared. You go. Listen dear. There is one girl.. ..daughter of the eldest brother. The same one who is like a puzzle. She is lonely. Like a withered flower. So many boys have rejected her. Her life is a misery. She is angry with herself. I am incomplete. I am unhappy. Am I a dream or am I thirsty for dreams? From behind the dark clouds.. ..come drops of rain. My tears. No one is mine. I am incomplete. I am unhappy. Mummy I am very lonely. Mummy. I have never seen you.. ..but I remember you a lot. Go my dear. Reach there tomorrow evening.. ..and take everyone by storm. Okay. So today onwards my name is Sanju Shastri. I will go Nattu baby. Wish me all the best baby. All the best! Shivani, are you asleep? O Dad! How many times have I told.. ..you not to drink and talk to me? Why do you drink so much? Once you get married this will stop. Daddy you must have been very angry with me.. ..when mummy died immediately after giving birth to me? I would not have taken birth and mummy would not have died. Answer me! Can I have one more small peg? No. Not at all. Never. Then even you will never ask me this question ever again. Not at all. Never again. Look one prospective groom is coming to meet you tomorrow. Don't be like this with an upset expression on your face. Hey Shivani. At least smile sometime. Little more. Little bit more. This much more. That's it. Good. Wow. You look like a princess. Try.. ..try till you succeed, okay. How do I look in this sari? Take it out. -Sari! I am not talking about the sari. I am talking about the Reliance shares. Let the shares be. It is almost 6 o'clock. The boy has still not come. Late come again. Hello, Mr. Manmohan. Savita sister-in-law, I have heard.. ..that the boy is very qualified. - Really? He is a CA and he imitates Rafi in the orchestra. And to top it all he is a kabaddi champion too. Wow. Three in one. But this princess of ours has to speak.. ..and mingle with people properly Like that so many people have come and gone. It is 6 o'clock. They must be on their way. Don't worry. Brother they must be having that no? That which is there on the letter. Stamp? -No. No. That which is written.. ..on the letter in 5-6 lines. O address! -Ya they would have that? -Stop it, Satish. Hi everybody. I am here! From across the seven seas. A long wait of 14 hours. From very far away and crossing the clouds and lightning. Cutting across the airport customs. Zigzagging through the city traffic. Here I am right before all of you. I think you all have not recognized me? See I tried to send across a message but. No we got the message. but.. You got my message? Good. But I never sent any message. Anyway you would have change for 5-600 rupees? He is asking money to look at our girl. The thing is that I only have American dollars.. ..and these credit cards. That's alright. We will pay the taxi. No. No No you don't go. Babubhai will go. Babubhai? -Babubhai. This is my special friend, Babubhai. And he is also an NRI like me. That's a very strange name for a dog. Babubhai! Grandfather! Grandfather! - Bless you my son.

I have helped you get a contract worth lakhs of rupees. Got you so much profit and you can't do this much for me. When will the ad for my underwear be ready? Don't worry, Batliwala. Your publicity will be done. When? When underwears go out of fashion? Don't be scared. Idea is ready, here take a look. Hey this is a blank paper. If you want to win over Batliwala, I will begin and you take over. Yes. Wow! What a great idea! - It's a good one! What is the idea? Tell me at least. There is a thick forest. There is another forest inside that forest. There is a third forest in that. May I say the fourth one? -Say it tomorrow. All around it is only thick forest. Obviously there will be forest in a forest. There is a big scary cave. -Yes. And in that cave very horrible jungle people live. And those people have not worn anything. They only have small things on their bodies. What small things? - Those which hang on branches. - Monkeys? No! -What are you saying? Monkeys hanging on their bodies! Brother that which hangs from branches? Green in colour. Leaves! - Right. Leaves hang from their bodies. -Yes. And they are wearing only leaves. Just one leaf in the front. If they are poor then one leaf. If they are rich then two leaves. Why two leaves? -One in front one at the back. And amongst those people begins a.. ..tender moment. A moment of love. Music. Tumba Tumba And then tiger roars. No. no not a tiger. I am scared of tigers. Tigers I am scared. Will a dog do? -Dogs are scared of him. Tigers will not do and dogs will not do. Then Batliwala will she do? She will do but how is she? She is black. Why black? Why is she not fair? She is not fair. That black one which.. ..flies from branch to branch. If she hangs from the branch how will she be of help to me? She will be. What is that brother, she goes coo coo? Cuckoo. - Cuckoo. Oh Cuckoo! I love Cuckoo. Then the cuckoo goes coo. Coo.

It's a dream. - Dream? I am giving you a dream that very.. ..soon you will walk, run, play. Actually people love me more due to this handicap. Raju, look that is the Sun god. Look at him and tell him to give you strength. He gives strength to the ocean, springs, clouds. Then why are you making me weak. Never give up in life no matter what happens. There is always tomorrow. One day I will make you alright with my magic. Really! - Really. That's enough! Stop it! Don't play.. Don't play with a child's mind like this. Do you know hat you are doing with him? Giving him hope. Giving him a goal to live for. You are telling lies. And there is no bigger sin than giving false hope to someone. Come on Raju. -Hey! What do I tell you! Her mother died giving birth to her. From that time she considers herself.. ..responsible for her mother's death. Why don't girls grow up properly in our Indian households? Why aren't they happy? There is no one reason for that. I don't know how many Shivanis might.. ..be there in all these houses! Who knows? She is sitting with a death wish on her face at this age. I can't bear that. These tears are also something Sanju. If they don't flow, they turn to ice. And when they melt they flow like the river Ganges. Hey Grandma, don't worry. I am there. I will squeeze out water from rocks and.. ..one day your Shivani will laugh. "Hey kids have you ever seen a black Taj Mahal? -What? Or have you seen an ocean without water? -No. Do you know how does a rasgulla look without the syrup? -How? See there that living sample, Miss Shivani. Hey! What is all this? We are getting bored. Let us have some fun. Lets do something. Hey Shivani. You look like a granny. You are an old item. Hey Shivani. Hey Shivani. Your youth is boring. Tell why the colour is off your face, you mad thing. Hey Shivani You are a flop story. You are mad genetically. Hey Shivani Hey Shivani Your body and mind is like a desert. When will it bloom? Your anger is like ice cream. When will it melt? God was also not in a mood that.. .. he patched you here and there and sent you here. Hey Shivani You look like a granny. you have water in a juice shop. Hey Shivani Hey Shivani If you cross the path, the cat will die. If a ghost sees you, he will be scared. You are so dull. You are so boring. If you run a race alone, you will lose. Hey Shivani You look like a granny. Your youth asks for some medicine. Hey Shivani Don't behave like a roadside Romeo. And don't bring your level down so much. This is my life. This is my style. You don't teach me. Who has said that every girl has to lead her life.. ..being fashionable and sexy. Hey Shivani you look like a granny. When will you be a princess? Hey Shivani Hey Shivani Hey Shivani You stale wife. Hey Shivani Born trouble. Hey Shivani You are a squinted girl. Hey Shivani You are a flop story.

When she died I fed 4000 wada pav to 400 priests.. ..on the banks of River Ganga. For peace of mind. Peace of mind of the priest? -No. My mother's. A person dies leaving behind memories. - And wada pav. You tell me you are sure you are Suman's son no? Here check and mate. Grandpa, where are you lost? I am worried about Shivani, what else! A prospective groom is coming to see her day after tomorrow. I don't know what will happen! No. I don't like it. And parties, discos etc? No. I don't go. To such places. Alright. Then what is it that you like? Nothing. -What? Please is there something else you want to ask? So did you meet Shivani? Yes. I met her and wasted my time too. How many times have I said that.. ..I don't want to give any interview to any boys! But still they doll me up and make me sit in front of them. Then the same questions and same answers. I am okay the way I look. I don't want to give any interview. What are you listening to? Come on scoot from here. Go! She has insulted me in front of my maternal people. Then what! -What is the matter with you Shivani? What is troubling you? Everytime it is the same. -Drama. Yes. It is always the same thing. People will say that aunties troubled a motherless girl. What is this "motherless" everytime! You keep quiet. What you are! -Don't say anything. This girl in the house and Dilip brother in business. We cannot say anything. Nothing! Why are you dragging me into this? You drag me into this everytime. Stop it! Don't fight till I am alive. He is very pampered. The union guys are dancing on our heads because of him. Business is down. Throw out those pests. See how cheaply he is talking! Yes. We are cheap. We only know how to talk like this. Should we leave this house? - Stop it! I am still here. At least don't fight in front of me. I have been running this house for the last 3 years. Really! -Do you want to hear something else? O you are running the house! - Shivani, you go inside my child. Get one thing very clear or.. You stop that. First you learn to speak properly. Stop it! The decision must be made today. Who will take care of the business? O so you want a decision? -Yes. You look into my eyes and ask. If I say something it will be an insult to you. You will insult me? -Yes. -Please don't go. All this is because of me. Please don't fight. Pinky! - Mummy! - Oh! My God! - Pinky! Pinky! - O heavens! Emergency call for Dr. Pathak. Please come to the casualty ward. Hello! -Hello! Is that you dear? -Your dear is dead! Where have you sent me? You have to.. Listen to me dear. This is a very poor family. Let alone the cash. They have sucked out my blood. Don't say anything. Look I cannot do this anymore. Don't say anything. Hey you. Lotion for itching. Return my money. Else we will not only take your blood but your kidney too. Hey Natwar. What has happened to your voice? I gave Natwar a laxative. His stomach is cleaned but his throat is bad. Right? Mr. Jogiya. I am doing your work only. It will take a little more time. Hey you VIP vest. Brush your brain and take out the cobwebs. And listen this doll of yours is becoming weaker day by day. I feel like killing her. What? But we will wait and see. Else how.. Else how much time will it take to kill! Jogiya sir. Please don't do anything to her. I will do your work. I have given you a month. The work must be done in a month. The thing is that even I don't like bloodshed. But what to do? Poverty is a very bad thing. You understood? You got me into trouble! Now how will I think with one kidney all my life? These people will not spare you. If you step out of the house they will kill you. If you remain in the house they will blow up the house. You do one thing. You stay put over.. ..there and think how to get money. If they don't have money loot the neighbour or relatives. Think of a new plan but do something. But get the money. You are listening to me and understanding my problem? I understood Natwar. Understood. I will do something but listen to me. Don't give them this address please. Okay? New plan. What I want to know is you really want to start a business.. ..and settle down here? Yes. - See! It is not very easy to start a business in India. It is a pain to establish a business here. Problem for place, power, license. Better still why don't you invest money in our business? 25% partner. Double the money in a year. Why? Don't you trust us? What are you saying brother Mahesh! I have faith in you. I don't have money. All my money is deposited in a bank in America. And I don't want you to depend on me. In fact I wanted you to help me. But what to do all our money is stuck in the business. Brother Mahesh, one person can help us. Who? -Shivani can help us. Shivani? -Yes. Help us? -Yes. In business? Yes. If that unlucky girl touches even Tata-Birlas.. ..they will go bankrupt.. ..what will she help us? Brother Mahesh, please try to understand my plan. Sure tell me. -Look. You find a groom in a very rich family and get her married. Alright. -And then you see her in-laws.. ..will help to reach the top in the market. - Really! Then companies. Shares. Then private aeroplanes. On one side your plane on the other, Dhirubhai's plane. Both will be conversing in the air. In mid air. Okay. That's enough. Don't make me fly so much. Which rich man will like to marry Shivani? Even middle class people run away, what are you saying? Brother Mahesh. You give me 15 days. If I don't change her behaviour.. ..thinking and looks in 15 days.. ..my name is not Sanju Shastri. Yes. I have read this only five times I must read this. O ho! What are you reading? Gandhiji's autobiography. Really! Who has written it? - Gandhiji. What does it mean to you? Babubhai she is asking you. Don't make fun of a dumb animal. I can call you dumb but not an animal. Leave me alone. - Wow. What a title! You smile and the world smiles with you. Hey what is this? Become sexy in 30 days! It says "Become smart in 30 days". How does it matter, sexy or smart? Doesn't make any difference. I know everything. All you guys! Look. You have been reading these.. ..books for 30 months not 30 days. Are you sexy? No. Are you smart? No. You are still the same boring person. Look did I ask you about myself? So ask me? Ask. Come on. Look I am Sanju, NRI. Non reliable Indian. Look you please don't bother me like this.

You are burning my books! You can't do this. Look. Do you know what I am burning? Debris. -Debris? This sawdust that you have been feeding to your brain.. ..for the last 20 years. ..for the last 20 years. These pages. Get away from these books Shivani. My books. My room will burn! Then get out of the room. No. No. Daddy! Grandpa! Let me go! Come on stand up. And walk on this else I will throw you down. What are you doing? Liberating you. I don't want to be liberated. Don't want. Look I will fall. If you have to fall, fall in love. Love yourself, Shivani. I will die. You are not alive even now. Look Shivani. I want to drive away the fear inside you. Look I am slipping from here. So I am here to catch you. You are mad! Mad you are! Yes. About you. - What? I mean I am your friend. Look Shivani. Breathe openly.

Fill the atmosphere with your own name. Come on. Take the out the fear from inside you, Babubhai. Learn to face life. Come on Babubhai. Get over the fears in life. I want that everyone should look at you. They should like you and love you. I am getting it! Just by wearing.. ..his shirt I can talk like him. Superb Shivani. Very good. Hey, please don't tell Sanju! Why should I change? If some one likes me fine otherwise let it be. Look Shivani, I have one latest idea. Please. Let it be. I don't want your Tarzan like ideas. First you push me down the terrace and burn my books! Now you want me to cut my hair and wear mini skirts? What is all this? What is this? What is this? What is this? Is this anyway of behaving with girls? Silly girl! I am showing you the moon.. ..and you're picking at my tiny mistakes. Look at the moon not at the finger. You! You! You are very clever! Thanks!

Really? - It is a saint's word. Believe me. You are a soft, sweet happy birthday cake. You are the only decent person in this unkind world. All the literature, books and computers on one side.. ..and your blushing on the other.

She was saying. Let alone other people no one values me in my own house. No matter how much I do, Mamma is always upset with me. From the time she has come from Indore, after her wedding.. ..she has no one over here except you. And what was she saying about making something sour? Sour pickle? -Sour Pickle. That is the speciality of my Indore Sisiter-in-law, Grandma had tears in her eyes. She said that if she gives you pickle.. ..you will feel she is buttering you. Sour pickle for me?

And if he wakes up in the night one.. ..has to sing a lullaby for him. No. Nothing like that. I am making this pickle for Mamma. Sour pickle for Mamma? At this age? Then we have to take very good care of Mamma. I must speak to Father about this, darling. What are you saying? If Father hears what will he say? Meaning Father does not know this!

After a very long time. I don't know if the taste is okay? Would you like to taste it? I have made it specially for you. For me? You made it for me! Very very very tasty. - You liked it? You reminded me of my school days. I had a friend, Meena. She used to get lots of pickle for me. She knew I love it. I used to eat it a lot. One day our teacher caught us. And your father-in-law is no less. He was after Meena. What am you saying? Oh! But why am I telling you this? Why Mamma? Can I not be your friend? Ratna! Ratna!

With spectacles and a stick. Sir. Don't go by my face. Just feel this material. And look at the edging. It is looking bad because I am wearing it. It will look very nice on her. Listen to me. Look here. Are you married? - No. Good. Else your wife would have.. ..run away with this dog of mine. And would I have left the dog's wife? - Quiet! You will have to change, Shivani. You have to understand what is ladies' fashion. Ladies' fashion is a fight between sex and tradition. Show a bit of your body. Hide a little bit. Show a bit of your body. Hide a little bit.

For the first time in life I have no words to express. Thank god! Come on, - let's go in. Forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty!

You silly girl! Come sit here. Shivani this happens in the beginning. When I got engaged to your Grandpa.. ..initially even I did not like him. Gradually I got to know his good points. It is such a strange thing. It takes maximum time to understand our closest people. Why are all such things explained.. ..only to girls in our society? I don't like him! What happened Shivani? What's happened again? Nothing daddy! Bhavani Junction! Shivani! Shivani Junction! Mother, what happened to her? I don't know what has happened to her again today? She was saying she is not happy with Mayur. Sanjay, you explain to her. -Me? She listens to you. She just doesn't listen to me. Yes. When you have not been listening to us for years.. ..why will you daughter listen to you? What mother? What sin have I committed? Do I become an ogre just because I have two drinks? You know everything, mother still! Its about tradition and upbringing. Upbringing! Then what about those who gamble? Day and night they are accounting for black money! They are decent! Don't shout! Dilip, Sudha is absolutely right. First you correct your habits. -But Father. Did someone remember me? I just heard. Someone was mentioning gambling. I don't know if he was saying gambling or was he blessing me! You are understanding! No I am understanding that's why. -That's enough! You guys stretch small issues like they do in TV serials. You get emotional for every little thing! Relax! I am there! I will explain to Shivani. You remain very puzzled these days? Why are you so lost in these crossword puzzles? Leave it aside. - Why are you bothered? That's mean. - Is it? What do you mean to me? What have you come to explain? Favoring my family? God must have had a tough time creating you. Shivani, mother was saying.. Solve this riddle first. A three letter word denoting love but in English. Three letters. Romance. Romance. Write.. romance. Come on. Are you listening? - No. I am watching. What's on your mind? Don't you even understand this much? Ask yourself the same question. Shivani, Mayur is a very nice boy. Talk to him, meet him and get to know each other better. Get to know about each other's lives. Look into his eyes and talk to him. Gradually, you'll begin to.. ..like his perfume, the way he smokes.. ..and the way he pacifies you. And slowly, your dream man will build a world.. ..of dreams around you. You'll eagerly wait every evening. You'll be impatient to receive his call. "It is my dream to see you in my dreams. Whether you accept it or not, you are my own. "It is my dream to see you in my dreams. "Whether you accept it or not, you are my own." "What kind of a relationship is.. ..this which beats like a heart." "It is my dream to see you in my dreams. "Whether you accept it or not, you are my own." "I laugh in my sleep." "I fly in my dreams. "It is my dream to see you in my dreams. "Whether you accept it or not, you are my own." "No one's name was on my lips till now." "Your gaze has touched my heart." "No one's name was on my lips till now." "Your gaze has touched my heart." "Awake or sleeping. I am lost all the time." "In loneliness look at my condition." "It is my dream to see you in my dreams. "Whether you accept it or not, you are my own." "I laugh in my sleep." "I fly in my dreams. "It is my dream to see you in my dreams. "Whether you accept it or not, you are my own." "Where do we go following our mind?" "Your signals stop me wherever I go." "Where do we go following our mind?" "Your signals stop me wherever I go." "Walking step by step. Stopping along the way." "How my destiny has changed!" "It is my dream to see you in my dreams. "Whether you accept it or not, you are my own." "It is my dream to see you in my dreams. "Whether you accept it or not, you are my own." "What kind of a relationship is.. ..this which beats like a heart." "It is my dream to see you in my dreams. "Whether you accept it or not, you are my own." "You are my own." Babubhai, love and matters of the heart are like quicksand. One who gets smitten by this bug is smitten forever. I have got the great gift of Shri Ram's blessings. I have got the great gift of Shri Ram's blessings. "I have got.. I have got.." Why are you stuck? Sanju taught me just this much. I don't know it after that. Even I don't know the whole hymn. The hymns may be incomplete but are values are intact. Our modern daughter has become traditional! It's a miracle. It's amazing, brother-in-law! Do something, granny. Make brother Mahesh understand. God bless you! Mahesh, why don't you give him a clear answer? Are you going to help him in business or not? Yes, mother. We'll think about it and then.. Relax, Sanju? Let my problem get solved with them.. ..and then I'll surely do your work. 100%. I promise. What does grandpa like the most? - Grandmother. Yet? - He has no choice. Come to the room when he is playing chess this evening. During the game? - Right. Wow! What a move! It's practice of over 30 years. My brains function like a whip! Brains! Forget the brains, grandfather. Let me see, you talk about the heart. Mahesh does not speak to you since years. What will you gain by winning these lifeless pawns?! I don't need anybody. - Hey, brother Mahesh! Join us. - I was just passing by. Where did the key go? - I bet he wants the key to the safe. There's nothing left in the safe, except the key! The elder son must have given the wealth away in charity! Join us. - He keeps taunting at me! He won't be able to play. This is not the share market! This is a game of chess! Whom are you asking me to play with?! Who wants to play with you! - Play with him? His camel is always crooked. - The elephant is straight. Play a wrong move. The old man will be happy. Why should I play a wrong move?! You don't interfere! Hey, what's the box for? - This is.. What's in the box? - This is.. What are they made of? - Of gram flour. Aren't these for old people who have no teeth? Yes. It is for those people. He has strong teeth. He doesn't let go of me. Come on, play your turn. I've played mine. What a move! - Correct! Whose son after all! - Correct! You don't interfere. - He doesn't take me as his son yet. Grandfather! Listen to me. Stop being stubborn. Let him win the game. Forgive him. Why.. Why should I lose? Who is the elder one? Me or him? I think, it's him.. I mean, you. In that case, he will lose and seek forgiveness. You don't interfere! If you want to win over the old man's heart, play the game wrong. I'm doing just that. I don't know how to play the game. What a move! Look at the fabulous move! Excellent move! You're great. Look at the game. He's stuck! You're stuck, Tilloo! Tilloo! You called me by that name after years! Father, I hadn't come looking for the key. I had come to give you 'laddus (Sweets)'. I wasn't playing the game either. You really tormented me! Now you can interfere. I didn't know that this mere 'laddu' held so much strength. Nobody loves me. What's the matter, Pinky? They keep arguing amongst themselves and don't love me. So what? I love you. You're so sweet. You aren't my father. I love you too. You're so cute! You are not my mother. Right. - It would have been real nice.. ..to have both of you as my parents. Idea! Why don't both of you get married to each other? You'll love your children a lot, right? Quiet! You talk a lot! Silly girl! No, stop crying. Come on, smile. I will laugh only if you pacify me together. - Ok. How do I tell you? I am feeling that. What? - Girls feel that in a veil. Perspiration? - No. When the girls feel that, they fiddle with the floor. Shy? - Yes, I am feeling coy. Anyway, I'll tell you. I.. I.. - You can't even say, 'I love you'?! What happened? - I can't say one thing right. I mean.. Use your will power. - Yours or mine? Yours, of course. In America, a man concentrated on a spoon and it became crooked. What? - There's more. When he was showing this miracle on television.. ..the spoons of the people watching the show went crooked. - Oh! Never mind. This is my new set of spoons. Repeat after me, 'I won't stammer after today'. I won't stammer. - Repeat that. I won't stammer. I'll deliver a cricket commentary one day. I'll do that. One day or test match? One day. Hail the Almighty! - Hail the Almighty! 'Betty bother bought some butter but the butter was bitter.' 'But the butter was bitter.' 'A full moon on valentine's day, who hit my bull?!' 'Who hit my bull?!' 'A brave heart and kidney liver.' 'A brave heart and kidney liver.' Damn! - Damn! What are you doing? - What are you doing? Move it away! - Move it away! Please! - Please! I am not talking to you. - I'm not talking to you. Give me Rs. 15,000. - What for? Are you looting?! Didn't it make a difference? - You're right, Sanju. I can see light! It is a miracle, Sanju! Divine light! You are great, I am great. God is great. Everyone is great! Go on. What's happening? - Check if the spoon has bent. Your eyes surely have! Well, something is better than nothing. Hey, shut your eyes. - Why? Please. Now bring your hand forward. Hold it. Quick. What's this? Feelings. Shivani. Shivani. Shivani. What are you doing here? - Wearing my shoes. Hurry and get dressed. Mayur is here to fetch you. There have been riots in Juhu. The area is under curfew. Sanju, what are you doing? Make her understand and send her in. Go get dressed. I don't want to go with Mayur. At least try the seven steps to fall in love. Give him a try. - Seven steps! Shivani, why did you bring the children.. ..along to ruin our privacy? Don't you like children? - Of course! You won't believe, but I too was a child once upon a time. Really. - In fact, I love children. I raise my neighbor's children. How sweet! The children call me Uncle Godrej. You'd love to carry then? - Sure. Carry Raju. He's tired. What? You want me to pick Raju up? You'll have to start training from now itself. Oh! Yeah! Give that to me. - Very good. Thank you, uncle. Today you have picked me up; someday God will pick you up. What? Oh, he's only a child. Though a joke, he speaks his heart out. Out there.. Come on, kids! Brother-in-law, I'm tired of eating. Now lift me. - What? Your brother-in-law will tell you a joke. I.. - Joke! Brother-in-law's joke! A joke by brother-in-law! Brother-in-law's joke! - Okay. - Children.. It's about a Sikh man. - We've heard that one. So you've heard this one? A donkey fell in love with a horse. We've heard this one, too. Let me complete it. - We've heard it as kids. You've heard it in your childhood. I just heard it. Have you come here to talk about animals or woo a girl? To woo a girl. - Then just say, 'I love you'. Yes! Shivani, I say it in front of everyone. I love you. - We hadn't heard this joke! Good joke! Quiet! This isn't a joke. It's really a good joke. - Good joke! I love kids! Congratulations! The Virani family has liked Shivani. What? The wedding shall take place within a month.. ..and they will take over our companies. This means, good days are here for all of us. Correct. - What about the money for my business? Of course. What a lovely day! Shivani's marriage is fixed. It is our parents wedding anniversary too. What? - Right. We'll give them such a surprise.. ..that will bring tears to their eyes. Once again? They keep crying all the time. Sudha, say it just once. Never. - Alright. Call me Dinu. No. You must say it for the sake of the 'Quit India' agitation. Remember, in my vigorous mood I had declared.. ..that I would be the leader of the country and change it? I had taunted saying that you couldn't change.. ..the elastic of your pajama, how would you change the nation. Correct! I had paid heed to you then. Now you heed me. Call out my name once. I told you, I won't. Dinu! Mother! Father! Hurry! What happened? - There's a problem downstairs. Please come soon! Grandfather please! - They won't even let me die in peace! Where is everybody?! - Don't. Are you mourning for me?! - Don't speak so. What's happening? - Why are you screaming? Will somebody speak up?! Happy wedding anniversary! We wish you both a very happy anniversary! There's a surprise party for both you. Grandmother will be the bride and grandfather, the groom. And we'll be the retinue. Well, is my bride feeling shy? Actually, yes. Let me put the veil over your head. "The moon will be in a veil. The moonlight in a scarf." "Stealthily the bride will see her groom." "The moon will be in a veil. The moonlight in a scarf." "Stealthily the bride will see her groom." "The trumpet will play the wedding march." "The trumpet will play the wedding march." "The moon will be in a veil. The moonlight in a scarf." Stealthily the bride will see her groom." "There are bells on the toes, vermillion on the forehead." "I would give my heart if she would call out to me." "I will never feel lonely with all these memories." "I will never feel lonely with all these memories." "The moon will be in a veil. The moonlight in a scarf." "Stealthily the bride will see her groom." "Palanquin, bangles, bracelets. Even if they are not mine." "You will be mine." "I love you. Let's see what the future holds for us." "Tell my father not to stop me." "Tell her father not to stop her." "Palanquin, bangles, bracelets. Even if they are not mine." "You will be mine." "I love you. Let's see what the future holds for us." "Today you hold me in your arms." "You are mine and I am yours." "Today you hold me in your arms." "You are mine and I am yours." "You get me a wedding ring and take me to your home." "Palanquin, bangles, bracelets. Even if they are not mine." "You will be mine." "The moon will be in a veil. The moonlight in a scarf." "Stealthily the bride will see her groom." "Palanquin, bangles, bracelets." "The moon will be in a veil." "Palanquin, bangles, bracelets." "The moon will be in a veil." "Palanquin, bangles, bracelets." "The moon will be in a veil." We will go on a strike! Long live the union! Fulfill our demands! Down with the Chowdhary industries! Down with Dilip Chowdhary! Fulfill our demands! - Worker's union! Forgive me, Mr. Dilip! Everything is over, brother! - Don't scream! Talk respectfully. What are you talking about?! Look at our state! We've been brought to the streets! Why did you trust the union?! The Malhotra products have bought over our workers! They will instigate a strike and take charge of our orders. Goods worth 2 12 crores will go a waste! Good day, sir! - What's the matter, Chauhan? Assure them that the factory will run smoothly. You, too? What do I do, sir? The hunger is such! It growls when empty, but burps when full! You're a sleazy man! - Our demand isn't new. As always, we want money. I'll take care of the workers. I would repeatedly tell you, don't be so noble! Don't spoil and fulfill the demands of the workers! All this has led to a strike! What will you tell the clients? You're on the streets over night! The company might have to be shut all because of you! I didn't wish bad for the company. What can I do if the union goes back on their words?! But you trusted them and they got sold! In today's world, men of principles.. ..can only get temples built for them, not homes! Then what do all of you want? Don't even give me the false respect of an older brother! - Yes! Today on, let's play our own game. All right. I apologize to all of you. Sanju, where are you?! Boss, Jogiya has put me under house arrest! He's given us the last warning. He's given two day's time! He'll not spare me tomorrow! You get the money somehow! I beg of you! I'm now fed up of Sanjay Shastri! Bro, you come here.. ..or I'll reach there! - I'm coming soon. What's all this happening? India defeated Pakistan in the match held. That's the reason for these crackers. - Is it? - Yes, kid. Do bear in mind! Let him know. Sanju.. What.. What's this? You aren't leaving us, are you? No, I was just.. I have lost, Sanju. The business has suffered a loss due to me. I didn't want this to happen. Only you can save me and my family. What can I do? Ask Shivani not to refuse the Virani proposal. They can take care of our companies. They can save us from debt and shame. Then I'll leave home and the business. I am not worthy of business! My honesty and thoughts are considered as weaknesses. My child will be sent off after marriage.. ..but I'll be the one to leave home. I am a loser. And then I'll search for truth. I shall ask life where I went wrong! Why was I made such a helpless father.. ..that I am getting my daughter married for money! Sanju, please make Shivani agree to the marriage. What more do I say?! Brother, everything will be all right. Is that all? Have you said everything? Now just answer in either a yes or no. If I'm not happy with this man and neither will I ever be.. ..will my family who wants me to be happy.. ..be happy themselves? No. - So just to keep the family business intact.. ..will I have to marry just anybody?! Today they are getting me married off to just anybody! What if Raju gets kidnapped and a ransom has to be paid. Will they let him die! Just because he is lame and I'm helpless! I can't do anything! What's the difference between us?! You know your father.. - Yes, I know. I know that my father has lost. He is completely broken. Does that mean I have to inherit.. ..his defeat and failure and live with it all of my life! Why? Only because I am a girl?! Sanju, for the first time I feel good. I am very happy that my mother is dead. I am glad she is not alive to see this! And you? What makes you give me this advice?! Look into my eyes and tell me. One day you had burnt my books in order to set me free! Today you've come to burn my future! Shivani! - Why didn't you push me down the terrace.. ..that very same day when you helped me breathe a new life! You freed me from my own cage, helped me face life.. ..and taught me to believe in myself! Why did you do it?! There's another thing that I have learnt about you. You lied to me. You can't be my distant relative. You are very close to me. Only someone close to you can hurt you so much. Swear by me and tell me if you are doing the right thing. Shivani, I don't have an answer to your questions. Is it a crime to keep oneself happy? No. Will you be happy to have a girl like me in your life? Answer. You like me? Do you love me? It's either a yes or a no. Tell me. Sister Shivani! They are calling you downstairs. I want an answer, Sanju. You know the answer. Shivani. Grandmother! Shivani, come on! Mr. Virani, the wedding shall be done with due pomp and show! The reception set will be one of its kinds! I'll call the film makers to get it done. We'll ask Govinda to dance for the reception. It's only a wedding. Why such a clamour? What's the matter? After all we have to be that with you.. ..that.. - What! - In step with you! I'll go stop this right away. - Don't be crazy! Let's take the name of Lord Ganesha and start. Enough is enough. With what right are you holding my hand? And with what confidence are you refusing this proposal? Girls have a sixth sense. A sense to recognize a touch. I won't say a word downstairs, but on a condition. What? You will meet me on the terrace this evening. Shivani.. what's this? You'll fall. You're there to hold me. Why should I be afraid? You want to kill yourself? - Yes. For you. Are you crazy? - Yes, I am. About you. Will you come down? - No. First tell me that you like me. Stop it, Shivani. Come on, Sanju! One day at this very place.. ..you had told me, 'Shivani, learn to face life.' And today you can't face me? Shivani, you are actually very beautiful. I like you. Now tell me.. Do you love me? Do you love me!? I.. I Love you. Ok? Come down please. You had said that you would teach me just 6 steps to win over love. I would learn the 7th step on my own. Right? I have understood it. One has to submit oneself in love. Complete the 7th round as well. I have already accepted you by mind. Now you can.. Join us, Sanju. - Come here, Sanju. Come, sit here. Here. Everything in your life. What's this? - It's Rs. 10 lakhs. You can use it for your business. The deal has been finalized with the Viranis. Congratulations! This is Rs. 5 lakhs for Shivani's marriage. Start the preparations. Her wedding should be one of a kind! Aren't you happy? What are you thinking about? You'll shut your eyes and you'll see me. Whereas, if you open them, you'll have to look for me. Now where will you go? Shivani Brother Sanju, please save me. Munni. What place is this, Sanju? It's beautiful! Today I am so happy that I might just start crying. You're like the stars in the sky. You're there with us, but not close. Shivani, I want to say something to you. Hey, wait a minute. Don't move. Your eyelash is so cute! Keep it on your hand, and take your love's name. Make a wish, and it will be granted. I don't want anything. - Don't insult the eyelash. Your eyes will begin to cry. Ask for me. - Enough, Shivani! Why are you in such a mood? I'll show you something else. Like crazy lovers, let's scribble our names everywhere. Sanju-Shivani..! - Enough, Shivani! Neither is this my name, nor am I yours. My name isn't Sanju Shastri. I took this name and your address from your relative.. ..and got into your house. Shivani, I am a fraud. I am a cheat. Really? I am not Shivani either. I am Phoolan Devi. Actually, I am Madonna. No! Actually I am Kamlabai Sontake. Greetings. Shivani, please! I came here with the intention of swindling your family of Rs. 50 lakhs. Idea..! Let's join hands and do it. Then we'll go to some far off place. Canada! America! No? All right then? Bangladesh!? Shivani please! Why don't you understand? I can't cheat you. Believe me. I am not worthy of being trusted. Don't look into my eyes. I am afraid of your eyes. You want me to make a wish, don't you? This is what I want. I want you to forget me. Forget me. "Why is it raining tonight? "Why is it raining tonight? My beloved is not with me! There is someone with me. My beloved is not with me! There is someone with me. "Why is it raining tonight? It's raining! I just need one more day. Tonight and tomorrow. She will understand. She has to. Don't worry. - Sanju. Sanju. You look upset? Tell me about it. You won't go away, will you? You won't, right? No, son. Don't be stubborn. This will help your foot. Sanju, he is not letting me apply the medicine. He listens to you. Please explain to him. Sanju? What's the matter? Look my stomach has gone in by half an inch. I can even speak fast. What should I say? What's the matter? Why do you look so glum? Come on, cheer up, man. Shivani,.. Shivani, at least listen to me. Why are you so sullen today. Mother says Shivani will leave us once she gets married. Will she really go away? You won't go away, will you? Tell us. - Today I have no story to tell. Please go away. Go. Hello. - Listen to me carefully. The real Sanju Shastri has escaped. He'll be there any moment. Take the money and leave that place immediately. It will be done tonight itself. Jogiya is after my life! I was forced to come on to the streets! Meet me at the toll post. Bye. Tell us where Sanju is? - Who? Sanju? - I don't know. - Where is Sanju? I've lost my memory. - And I've lost my patience. Come on! - True. Wait, brother Sanju! Brother Sanju! My feet! - Raju! Raju, you've begun to walk?! Raju! - Mother! Raju! - Raju! - O my God! Look at my feet. Hadn't you told me? Sanju, you've performed a miracle! I didn't do anything. I was running away from here. I say.. What happened, Shivani? Raju has begun to walk! Raju.. - Hey, he is standing on his feet! I had the confidence that Raju would be able to walk someday. Sudha. - He needed a shock. You pretended to run away, didn't you? Thank you, Sanju. Thank you, son! Hats off to you, Sanju! You performed a miracle! I.. I didn't perform any miracle. In fact, I was running away from here. We will be indebted to you all lives. What do you mean to us? Why do you do all this? I didn't do anything. I am not a sage who performs miracles. I was running away. I want to say something to all of you. Brother Mahesh .. Shivani, you know everything. You tell them. This is yet another spell of yours on our family. The same spell that you cast on me as well. Mother! Grandfather.. father, I.. I love Sanju. What? - What nonsense are you talking?! We've given our word to the Virani family. This is my life, uncle. Why are you quiet, Sanju? Answer. Whether Sanju admits it or not.. I love him. Only him. If this time I am stopped, I will commit suicide. Shivani. - Don't pay attention to her. Neither am I Sanju Shastri.. ..and nor am I worthy of this relationship. He is a cheat! He is a fraud! - Who are you? Sanju Shastri. - Sanju! I'm your relative. He took information about you from me, took your address.. ..snatched my passport and came here! And his friend kept taking me around in India.. ..for two whole months! He's a very smart man! I am Suman's son, grandfather. Where are you going, Mr. Sanju? That means Raju's recovery was a mere coincidence?! You snake! Such a nasty fraud! Why did you do this?! - What do you want?! Money? How much?! - Call the police! Right away. - Don't call the police please. How could you play such kind of a game with us?! You were so much a part of us! Such fraud! Such a farce! Now we will never be able to trust another man! Why did you do this?! -You were actually running away! Raju's recovery wasn't due to a shock, it was a coincidence! And we thought you had performed a miracle! He can't make Raju stand! He is a disgraced soul! Liar! Why did you do this, son? I took you as a son. What did you gain? Those hymns.. the Ramayana.. you proved my devotion wrong! You will be cursed! You would play chess with me! Such a scheming mind! He has mocked our love! Look at her. She's crying. Why did you play with my daughter's feelings?! Dreams of being rich! A flourishing business! What do you want?! Money?! How much do you want?! What's in the bag? - Money for the wedding. Rogue! - Don't hit him! Give the bag! Don't hit him! Thief! No.. - Move aside! - Don't hit him please. Give the bag! Dad. - Give the bag! Give the bag! - You scoundrel! - You scoundrel! 'Are you hurt? Apply iodex (Pain Balm) and get to work.' Get up. Hey, who are you? Doesn't the gun in my hand give you a clue about who I am? What have you stolen? - Nothing. 'My hearts pines for more.' Give it to me. Give it! I'll tell you what he's stolen. Look. Wow! What a scene! The thief as well as the one.. .. whose house was stolen, both are crying. What a scene! What's all this? What's this? 50 paise? Yes.. Mere pennies! Yes.. The holy text of 'Geeta'. Did you break into Chowdhary's house or a pauper's! Look at the thrash he's stolen! We're after your life, and you're surrendering your life elsewhere!? Hey dude, if you take a left from this house.. ..you will step into another world. You won't get a penny for this stuff. And you've picked thrash from the palace! Wow. Please stop crying. We'll begin to plunder soon. Start. - I beg of you. Spare this family. Why? Is she your sister? I am related to you? I need my money! Plunder! That is between you and me. Don't drag this family in between. You wouldn't know the meaning of a mother or relations! I don't want you to mess here, Jogiya! Or I'll bury you right here! 'Add ice to milk during the summer, it makes it very nice.' 'Have milk..' The aged are reflecting their youth! 'This is all about comfort, and my choice.' Did you have fun with her, or should I do that as well? I love her, Jogiya! So your true colors are out. Go in and bring the jewellery and money. Go! No one will go in! - Nobody will? Chiman Tunda, heard that? 'Lifebuoy keeps you healthy and fit.' Bring the parcel. You can't escape his vigor! So now you'll care a damn about them, right? Go get the money. - Leave the child! Is that so? Throw the child. No! - Brother Sanju! 'What a catch! Have Britannia and go for the world cup.' Put the child down! Sanju! Now shoot! - Sorry. Look at my plight. Then how did you become a goon? Sorry. - You.. That's it! Now you'll never starve. You're welcome at all signals. Leave. Hey, Catch him. - No! Stop it. - No.. no.. - C'mon, Mr. Jogiya. Come, we'll teach you a lesson. You are under arrest. Take him. Gun. Hats off to you! Your heart is your weakness as well as your strength. Go fall in love and get married. Each of your punches had a strong commitment for life. Don't worry. I'll take care of her. May God bless you! Bye. After I came here, I lied about everything. Everything I said was a lie. There was one truth. You are indeed very beautiful! Beautiful enough to make any man's life better. What about your life? - Forget me. Like a bad dream. Weren't you the one who had said, no matter what, never give up? There is always a tomorrow. I don't know about anyone else, I forgive you. Get up, brother Sanju. Please. You're the one who introduced me to myself. How can you be bad? Look through my eyes. You're so nice! You're very nice, Sanju! Believe me. Our child's happiness is above all. When you weren't related to us, you stayed over for so long. Now that we have formed a relation, you're leaving? Hey Sanju, come on. Or we'll lodge a police complaint. A man gave us dreams and left. "Very beautiful are you." "Very beautiful are you." "Very beautiful are you." "Very beautiful are you." "These hairs of yours." "Let them fly away from your face." "Very beautiful are you." "Very beautiful are you." "Very beautiful are you." "Very beautiful are you." "These hairs of yours." "Let them fly away from your face." "Very beautiful are you." "Very beautiful are you." "Very beautiful are you." "Very beautiful are you."
