Read it, it doesn't bite. For how long, Tejada? Until you're sick of it. This is from above. What about in six months? What it says there. I didn't request your transfer, but in my opinion, if you follow all the rules you won't have problems. Then sack me. Everyone goes their separate way. There are enough precincts. Nobody wants you, Frenchy. Listen, because you did your own damn thing in Madrid doesn't mean we'll let you do the same. This isn't the capital. I know you're far from home, and what happened was a bummer. But that's no excuse to screw around. - They didn't do their job. - Neither did you. Taking you off the case was the least of your worries. So you can start being grateful. They don't even want you in Madrid, Bianchetti. I asked you not to call me. What is it, Manuel? They won't let me go back, Patri. They don't want to. They want me here, cut off. They won't let me leave here. What did you expect? Let it go, Manuel. For your sake and the kid's. It's been years now. What's in it for you? Closure. Isn't it what any father wants? What any father wants... And me, Manuel? What about me? Am I not handling it well? As a mother, I'm telling you that it's over, okay? It's over, there's nothing else. Period. Like it or not, we have to suck it up. Even if you busted him, she's not coming back. Let it go once and for all, Manuel. How's the kid? Fine. She's fine. Is she there? No, she's not at home. Take care and don't drink too much. Bye. Look on the bright side. Come rain or shine, your salary is yours. You have your post. What the hell more do you want? Thing is, you end up like a zombie here. That's the downside. When's your next review? In six months. Give it time, Manuel. Patience. It's not gonna happen, Morgado. Frenchy! You'll make a great filing cabinet, dude! Already got the feather duster? Or does Morgado do that? - What the hell? - Cut it out! Cut it out! Cut it out! You're looking for trouble! - It's over. - What's up with you? - Taken a fancy to him? - Move it! Hiya. - Hey, what's up? - Hey. I won't keep insisting. We can have a beer whenever you want, let me know. But that's it. Not another word. So what happened? Tell us, you hussy. Tell you what? About Juan. - Are you not going out? - Enjoy it, you've got him where you want. I'm not in the mood. If it were me, I'd have a roll in the hay with him. Are you up for it? Don't make me talk! Geez, what are you guys like? - Sure. - Okay, how are things out there? The guy in four is a pain in the ass. Bastard. He spent all night asking for water. What a pain! So no joy with Juan? The damn floor, sweetie. Nothing dries. I slipped and fell over. I nearly didn't get up again. Your house is a real death trap. Want me to take a look? No, it's fine, sweetie. The doctor will be right with you. There's no record of admission for the bruises. Not here or anywhere else. Those bruises are not from a fall, and especially not that cut. - Did she report it? - No. Well she should. Could you talk with her? Cristina, we don't have time. Come on, we're busy. It's late, Manuel. Go home and get some sleep. PRIVATE NUMBER Seriously? I said it was a lie, right? You don't care what's happening. Look at my wife, how do you think she feels? Look. You don't care what we're going through. I'm not reporting a cell phone or lost keys, I'm telling you that my little girl is dead, my daughter. And you're acting like it's nothing, she's our kid. Our kid! And you're not doing a thing, damn it. And my daughter is still in the morgue. Go out and look! Do something! Quit screwing around! How's the coffee? Just for you, right? Why all the fuss upstairs? Didn't you hear? They found a girl in a trash can at the port. Dead. Sixteen years old. Messed her up good. Who's on the case? YOU HAVE 20 MISSED CALLS YOU HAVE ONE VOICEMAIL You have one new voicemail. Received on May 18 at 7. 18 a.m. We can't do much without a number. It's not a crime to call from a withheld number. They're usually cold-calls to sell a phone, insurance, or make you an internet offer. Right, but it's not a call to sell me something. There are over 20 messages and all you hear is traffic, in less than an hour. It's not normal. Just noises on the street. No threats? That is the threat. But you can't report someone without a number. It depends what you want to do. Report it or not. It's completely up to you. Yes, I want to report it. I'm going to do it. You're reporting a call? Madam. We don't have all day. Do you want to report the call? Yes, I want to report it. Afternoon. They said you could help me. About my daughter, I mean. Who said that? Word on the street. There are no secrets in CÃ¡diz. It's best if you talk to the detective. There is no detective. You'll be assigned one. We've been waiting three days. Not a thing. I don't understand it. Why don't they do something? Mariela... Aren't they bothered about a 16-year-old Colombian girl? Is that it? Does she have to be Spanish for you guys to move your asses? Well, if your people didn't lift a finger for your daughter, - why would they do it for mine? - Who told you that? I'm not saying. Look, they say you moved heaven and earth for your girl. Please do something for mine. Let's go. Hi, Dad. Listen, I'm gonna be late. But Javi is giving us a ride. So don't worry. And stop scowling, I can see you, grumpy. Sweet dreams. Love you, bye. Hi, Dad. Listen, I'm gonna be late. But Javi is giving us a ride. So don't worry. And stop scowling, I can see you, grumpy. Sweet dreams. Love you, bye. Clara Vidal. She died between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. Internal and external injuries. Really vicious. How so internal? Wasn't the autopsy report uploaded onto the system? Your people definitely have a copy. Actually, one of your guys was here. A young guy. Is Silva handling it? Jesus, you're going to get me into trouble. I thought your disciplining was over. Anyway... Marks on the neck indicate she was strangled. Possibly with a rope. The scratches are from trying to defend herself. No traces of the lowlife who did it. Not even under the nails? Nothing. No hair, skin or semen. There's nothing to go on. Any cases like this recently? No. Not like this one. I want a copy of the report. I'll be the one they report if they find out you were here. What are you up to? I prefer it when you're being punished. Give me ten minutes. Oh, my little girl. No. He's here. Oh my God, my baby! My little girl. Any boyfriend? She was 16, what do you think? Freddy. I'd never seen him before. He turned up here that night, I had no idea who he was. He told me he was a friend. He said he'd been with her all night, but now he couldn't find her and she wasn't picking up. What time was that? Late. Around three in the morning. What did you do? What could I do? I got dressed and we went to look for her. But we split up. Where did you go? I didn't know where to go. I didn't know where my kid used to hang out. So I looked everywhere. Some dad, huh? He doesn't know where his daughter goes or who she's with. And this Freddy guy? No, I didn't seem him again. They called us at about five in the morning. We went to the hospital. Was Clara acting strange? Was she happier than usual? More restless? Quieter? When will they find him? Is the guy on her case no good? Take whatever you need. This phone is locked. By pressing any button, it alerts the switchboard. The switchboard? So we can call you. Monitor your calls. - But it doesn't work. - Let me see. Hang on, I forgot the charger. Here, sorry. Cristina. Try not to go places alone. If you go out, make sure it's at rush hour. If you see anything strange, whatever it is, call us. A car parked outside your house for more than two days. Or if you think someone is following you. Anything strange, you call us. Okay? And don't pick up unless you know who is calling. I'll need another number besides your cell. In case we can't contact you. A relative, a female friend... No. No... I don't have... Okay, no worries. I'll try and find out more about Eugenio. Okay? Wait here. Thanks. Evening. What can I do for you? I see you have CCTV. I'd like to see some footage. Is it about the girl in the trash can? The cameras are to monitor the facility, not outside. Maybe one captured something. The one on the corner. Absolutely not. You need a court order. Think of the girl's family. - If it's only for a second... - Shut it! I'm just looking out for my job. You can take it or leave it. - It won't do any harm... - Shut the fuck up! See you around. Guys. Do you know her? - No. - No? Guys, do you know her? Shut your mouth. Guys. Do you know her? Do you know her? Yeah. - Freddy's girlfriend. - No she wasn't. They hung out together. Yeah, bullshit. Two years hanging out? When was the last time you saw her? - That night... - They were with us that night. Partying outdoors. Where? Here, same as usual. Where would we go? Till what time? - Till about 1 a.m. - Until they had a row. They were always rowing and then making up. Freddy is a good dude. It's normal to row with your girl, right? Yeah. - Why were they rowing? - 'Cos she was a prick teaser. - That's not true. - And she didn't like partying. He was always so goddamn jealous. She talked to other guys... to make Freddy jealous, but they were crazy in love. So they rowed and...? Did they split up? He was with us. He was going crazy 'cos she'd gone to Imagina by herself, single guys hang out there. Where is this Imagina place? Back there. After the traffic circle, you have to leave this block. Why did you tell him? - What about you two? - Chill, okay? What's up? We... were here with her. We met some guys. We were popping out to smoke and we saw Clara was chatting with a guy... who was well dressed, preppy. And before we knew it... They'd gone off down the street. Didn't she say goodbye? No, not a thing. We were celebrating that she was going to leave Freddy. 'Cos of all his jealousy crap. And what about the preppy guy? She went off with him in a big car. Car? I dunno. A big one. - Like an SUV. - Black. Thanks. No problem. Hi, Pilar. What's up? Hi, Cristina. How are you? Fine. I just got home now, what is it? Listen, I have to tell you something. Go on. Eugenio is out of jail. Don't worry. We think he's in Granada, where his parents live. But it's virtually impossible for him to know where you are. You don't know him. Take it easy, listen to me. You can keep on living your life like you have up to now. It's unlikely he'll ever find you. Thought you'd left us, Bianchetti. Any news about the girl? What girl? The one at the port. They busted the boyfriend. Has he been questioned yet? Golden Boy stuck him in solitary to make him squeal. How many cases has Silva been on? If this isn't the first, he'll have to make his debut. That's what I say. What are you up to, Manuel? Do you like all of this, Morgado? I do what I have to do. Let's get that straight. That makes two of us. That makes two of us. Are you my attorney? No. Then I'm not saying anymore. It wasn't me, but you don't care about that. You had a row with her. You split up. Then you went to look for her at Imagina. And what happened? What happened? What happened is that I left. I left. I shouldn't have gone. I couldn't stop thinking about her all night. I called, but it was no good. I went to look for her, okay? - I went to look for her. - Where? Everywhere. I went everywhere. I went to Imagina, I went to the malls... When I didn't find her, I went to her house. She wasn't there. I told her dad everything that had happened and he came with me until we split up. What time was that? At about three. Anyone see you between one and three after you left Imagina? No. Did she ever cheat on you? Why are they doing this to me? Because I'm a "beaner", right? That's the way it goes. It's because you have a shit alibi. And they don't like it. You'll carry the can, Freddy. That's what's going on. Evening. Remember me? Sure I do, man. How could I forget? You have to realize that everything outside is in black. In the past you could see everything going on outside. Around here we sometimes get couples who come to make out and stuff, but it's entertaining. All right, go ahead. I'd like to sit the entrance exam to become a cop. Prepare yourself for endless shifts. Show me that one. That's a fixed camera, it only records cars coming in. But can we see the footage? Of course we can. - Around three in the morning. - Three in the morning. Can you fast-forward it quicker? Sure thing. Stop, stop, go back. Looks like a SUV. And a big one at that. I've handed it to you on a plate. Bye. Sit down... there. Anything for the cut? Gauze, alcohol, a first aid kit? Yeah, look in the drawer. I live underneath you on the second floor. I've never seen you before. What's your name? Cristina. And you? Manuel. I'd give anything to hear her voice. Even if she were arguing, just imagine that. Do you really think that someone capable of an atrocity like that could then come to my house and tell me he can't find her? What about your kid? Sorry. What will happen to him? With that alibi, he'll go before the judge. Then into custody. Until there's a trial. But do you really think it was him? He looked for wherever he could. Going to your house was dumb rather than smart. Not what someone looking for an alibi does. And I don't think he drives a SUV. He's a nobody. What? What do you mean a SUV? The person who did it drove Clara to the port in a big vehicle. A SUV. It's all I've found out. A black SUV? A girl came to visit us yesterday. She wanted a word with us. Something similar happened to her. They raped her. She mentioned a SUV. A black one. When this is over, I'll wait for you downstairs. At eight. All right? None of your people have been. Nobody. Not even the one in charge. What did I tell you? I told you everything, what do you want? Now I want you to tell me. It was around March. We went out in Jerez. We met some guys and my girlfriend was checking one out. And... before I realized, they were necking. The others were doing their thing. I got talking to one of them. It got late and Daniela had gone. He said he'd give me a ride home. And on the way, he turned off towards the port. To where Clara was found. We stopped. We made out. He stopped being nice. He suddenly grabbed my hair, slapped my face hard, my head, then he tore off my clothes. I thought he'd kill me. He grabbed my throat and only let go when he came. He came inside me. He kicked me out of the car. Like a dog. Did you report it? And? I withdrew it. Dropped it. I dropped the charges. A few days later, a man arrived who said he was an attorney. He offered me 20,000 euros if I dropped the charges. He told me it was the most I'd get in court. And your friend? She was with that guy for a while. Nothing serious. A few months. Where can I find Daniela? She works in a store. Next to Casa Manteca. Hurry up. JosÃ©! Who's JosÃ©? Daniela. Remember Daniela? You met her at a club in Jerez. - Yes or no? - Yes, yes, yes. Good. She was with a friend. Carmen. - Remember Carmen? - I remember her. Yes. That night Carmen went off with one of your buddies. - Who? - I dunno. There were a bunch of us. I was with the babe. I don't remember the ugly one. Yes you do, JosÃ©. - Who did she go off with? - There were a bunch of us. The Murillo dudes. I hardly know them, I swear. I left with Daniela and I saw one of the Murillos talking with Carmen. What are their names? I'll tell you, but please don't tell them I said so. Lucas and Abraham. Please don't say anything. What are you after? Crime reports. Take your pick. Look. "Carmen Esquivel, 23: rape". She dropped the charges? Eight days later. Do you know of any more? Rape charges that were dropped? A lot of charges are dropped. It's more unusual for rape. It's serious. - How many rapes are reported in CÃ¡diz? - Not many. The bastards know the score. There are more reports of assault than rape. What exactly are you after? Reports with the same pattern. Rape, a young girl, a SUV. And then the charges are dropped. The same goddamn pattern. Yes? The Murillos. Abraham and Lucas. Two rich kids. No police record. But everyone here knows they're in charge of trafficking between San Fernando and La LÃ­nea. The bastards get the lion's share of the hashish they move without dirtying their hands. Why all the interest in these two? According to Carmen, she went off with a Murillo. She was beaten up and raped in a black SUV. Guess where. Does Golden Boy know all this? Can you help me? Want one? No. He did it so I know he's out. Is he tagged? No, the judge on my case said it wasn't necessary. But... I have this. They use it to monitor me in case something happens. And it's happening. Again. Where does he call from? I don't know what to do. What do I do? Hi, Dad. Listen, I'm gonna be late. But Javi is giving us a ride. So don't worry. And stop scowling, I can see you, grumpy. Sweet dreams. Love you, bye. Hi, Dad. Listen, I'm gonna be late. But Javi is giving us a ride. So don't worry. And stop scowling, I can see you, grumpy. CRISTINA Yes? Hi. Do you mind if we talk? Can't sleep? No. No, I can't. I'm... scared to close my eyes. It's what scares me most. Closing my eyes and... It's like going back to that day. My eyes closed... I couldn't fight it... I couldn't. I couldn't do a thing. It was... like an overwhelming darkness, you now? He can do whatever he wants. Whatever he wants. He's doing it already. You know what? It's going to happen. Wait and see. And am I going to stop it? I'm the one living in a prison. He got seven years, two knocked off for good behavior, and in five he's out again messing with my head. We count when we're gone. That's when we matter. That's when we do count. Because that's what we are. Goddamn numbers. I'm a number. Meanwhile... we work out cheap. I just spouted so much shit! You're not from around here, are you? No, from Colomiers, an hour from Paris. But I'm a bit of everything, a mix. A bit Italian. More French. I moved to Madrid at 15, and now I'm in CÃ¡diz. What about you? Your accent isn't from here. No way! I'm from Granada. Where people have an attitude. And... do you have a family? I mean, a wife, kids? Yes, I do. A wife and a little girl. This is where I... - See you at eleven. - Okay. Thanks. Hey. What's your game, Manuel? If Tejada sees this he'll screw you alive. Find anything? I don't know what the fuck you're doing snooping. It's not your daughter. Move your ass. That's why they pay you. - Hello? - Guadalupe Morales? Who's calling? I'm police lieutenant Manuel Bianchetti. You dropped charges... - Yes? Who is it? - Mari Luz GarcÃ­a? Yes. Who's calling? I'm Manuel Bianchetti. I'm calling about charges you dropped for an alleged rape. Yes. Is something wrong? I'd like to go over some of the details for our records. Could we meet? They told me everything was fine. Who told you that? - Mari Luz, who told you... - Yes, I heard you. I work at Dimas. Come by around ten and we can talk. Okay, see you at ten. What are you doing, dude? Move your car. What is this? Get out of the car. - What's your problem, fag? - I said get out of the car. Yeah, I'll get out 'cos you say so. Who the fuck are you, jerk? You're getting into real deep shit. Real deep! Yeah, in deep shit. - You know that kid is inn... - You can't just beat a guy up. You know Freddy isn't the one who murdered the girl. - You do. Don't say you don't. - There's no forensic proof. Do you hear yourself? - Do you know what you're asking? - Yes. I want Forensics to take samples of the upholstery. Samples of the upholstery... There isn't a court order. What about the cash in the envelope? You can do it one way or another. Jesus, do you hear yourself? Listen up. If there's no evidence of the girl in there, my bad. But if there is, you get the goddamn pat on the back. Where did the fucking SUV idea from? And what if the SUV is clean? Second degree contusion to the left cheekbone with a one-inch cut. Third degree contusion with a fracture of the lower chin. A two-inch cut to the lower lip. Shall I go on? You've become a real thug. Beating up a kid and stealing his car because you goddamn wanted to. Look at me when I'm talking to you! Lucas Murillo is reporting you for assault. Anything to say or are you saving it for court? His car is linked to Clara. Jesus Christ, Frenchy! What the hell? - Forensics... - You're nobody here! Nobody! You're in no position to tell us what to do or not to do. You piece of shit. Silva. The night Clara was killed, Lucas Murillo was in Jerez. He has witnesses, Manuel. I'm so happy you screwed up again. Your badge and gun. Come on. You're suspended without pay. Don't let me see you here again. Get out. What if he's right? How would that drunken piece of shit be right? Come on, off you go. What do you want? Who was it? This guy. Sure? Yeah, it was him. I'm sure. Did you get him? What can I get you? A beer. Are you Mari Luz? No, that's her. Let's go back there or outside. No need. Just tell me which of the two it was. It was him. That was the bastard who beat me to crap. You all have to report it. How do you mean? You're not the only one. When I went to drop charges, the cops told me not to make a mistake again. So no way. Bring him over here! Over here! What's up, motherfucker? I'll kill you! I'm gonna kill you! Come on. Yell, you dog. Let's hear you! Yell! Manuel? Manuel? What happened to you? Morning. You had a bit of fever. How do you feel? Who's Sol? When you were asleep you kept calling her name. My daughter. She was my daughter. The eldest. She was murdered years ago. Raped. Beaten to a pulp on a vacant lot. The guy who did it tried to burn her. Sol, that was her name. I moved heaven and earth. I lost everything. And I've lost what little I had left of her. Your wife... you said you had... My wife... and my other little girl. He took Sol away from me, but I lost my wife and kid by myself. I'm sorry. Do they know who did it? No. I couldn't find him. I found the wrong guy. And I killed him. An innocent man. When do you start work? Jesus, Manuel. You look a real mess. The car that tailed you belongs to an Emilio Galvino. He's in the projects, San Fernando, be careful. Thanks. I'm sorry, Manuel. I told the Vidals about you. The mother. I have a daughter, too. But I want to keep coming home and finding her there. I'm really sorry. Who sent you, motherfucker? Who? Talk! Tell me! Who the fuck sent you? Answer! Christ, Carmino! Help! Help! Everyone out! The guy is killing Carmino! Everyone back! Back! Back! Move! - Back! - Grab him, grab him! Don't run, faggot! Stop running, fucker! Motherfucker! - Open the fucking door! - Get out now! Lucas Murillo. They dragged him off the road and carved him up. Where were you last night? You beat him up, stole his car, and now this. He's my brother! Let me see him! Let me see my goddamn brother! Get off me! Let me see him, goddamn it! Lucas! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Lucas! What went down yesterday? Seems you stirred up some trouble. Why were you there? Taking a walk. Don't screw with me. Can I go? Part of the upholstery in Lucas Murillo's SUV. I sent it to the forensic pathologist. Why not just to Forensics? He has samples of Clara, they don't. Of all the stuff collected, neither the brother or anyone in his family recognizes this. Morgado! What did you tell him, snitch? What did you tell the father? Tell me! Let's keep calm, you would have done the same. What the fuck did you say? Keep that badass attitude for outside, okay? I'm sick of putting up with shit and seeing archives fill up with cases no one touches. But you still threw me under the bus! No, Manuel! I didn't! You did that all by yourself! I'm really sorry! What do you do if a father wants to know who killed his kid? - Do you know what you've done? - The same as you! No, your hands aren't stained with blood. To do right by someone you don't need to be bloodstained! I swear on my daughter's life, I didn't think he'd kill the kid. I promise. You should have handled it. Why did you do it? So those bastards know what it is to lose what you love. You don't know who it was. An eye for an eye, Manuel. Life means suffering. Like me. He's a good man and a wonderful father. Quick, get inside. Come out here, you motherfucker! Move, move. - This way. - You're gonna be toast! Stay there. Shut the door. Open up, you dog! Here I am, fag! Come on, show your face! Where are you, bitch? Come on, motherfucker! Come on. Show your face, motherfucker! Open up! Open up! Watch out, Carmino, watch out! Stop it, stop it! Please stop it! Stop, I'm begging you. Not like that. No more blood. Please. Does Carmino ring a bell? He doesn't ring a bell? Because he sure knows you. He gave me your name. You sent me to him. To him and all his lowlifes. I've no goddamn idea what you're on about. You'll have to prove it, right? What proof do you have? A drunkard's word against mine? You stand to lose. T'es vraiment qu'une ordure. They found traces of the girl in the Murillo's SUV. Internal Affairs are handling it, we're out. - They're gonna screw Tejada. - When? Today at the latest. Before Clara, there was Carmen Esquivel, Mari Luz GarcÃ­a and probably more. They were raped by the two brothers. They paid them not to report it. Ask Morgado for the charges they all dropped. If you do that, they won't leave you out. - Hello? - Patri, it's me. - Please, Manuel, I told you not... - No, please. Just listen to me, okay? Please just listen to me. I didn't... I didn't handle it well as a dad. I didn't... You did. As a mother. You did. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry to have... I lost both of you. I'm sorry. Voicemail service. No new messages. Help!
