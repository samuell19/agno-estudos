So after consolidating assessments has to come this. Look at page 30. 30 is where is supposed to be. But this binder is wrong because page 30 starts there... ... they go in the binder and then... and then you can make the binder. Tom! Tom!! In my office, please! What's up? Well, I need to- no. Hey! No, no, no! That's- Ok. Autocall Navigation, please state your destination. Nice voice. What are you doing this Friday? ( navigation system ) I'm sorry, I didn't get that. Could you please take me to Interior Motivation Design Firm? Calculating route. Thank you. Alright, look alive Zack, look alive. Hey. Hey. One large cappuccino coming right up. Alright. I got some news. Morning, Kelly. Oh, morning, Rachel. How's the prep on the Susan Meyer house going? Uh, solid. I just have to pick up some samples and put together a look book for tomorrow. Ok, what about tonight? Got any big plans? Morning. Uh, when do I have big plans on a week night? Hi. Or weekend. What? Nothing. Why do you ask? Well, there's this friend of a friend, great guy. Recently divorced... Another one? Rachel, I need time. I've given you some time. More than enough. Well, if they're so great why are you still single? I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that. It's just dinner. Fine. You're gonna have so much fun. So you're working where? Autocall. The talking car thing. Road side assistance, navigation, traffic reports. It's actually quite extensive. I don't get why someone with your credentials wants to work at a call centre. I just needed a change of pace. Alright, well I'm happy if you're happy. Thank you. Speaking of making each other happy... What? I kinda did something. Oh no. As your friend. Zack, what did you do? I got you a date for tonight. What? Yeah! I made reservations at the Italian spot across the street- Cancel it. Cancel it. Are you kidding me? You're gonna love it. Zack, no. Come on, man. You gotta get back out there. No, I don't. Yes you do. Who is she? She's a friend of a friend. Who cares? She's cute. You don't even know. She's... I don't even have a choice, do I? She's expecting me. Come on? Fine. Yes! That's the type of enthusiasm I like to see. Ho ho. Now get on up, we don't want you to be late for your first day at work at the call centre. I'm in the middle of my drink, you're kicking me out? Ok. Well this is really nice. Tell you what. I'm gonna take this with me, I'm not gonna bring it back. I'm gonna keep it. I'm gonna put it in my kitchen. Thank you. That's my favourite cup. And thanks for the date. Jeff. Dave. Hey. Welcome to Autocall. Thanks for having me. This is Laurie, our receptionist. Laurie! She's gonna help you with administrative tasks. Hi. Hey. Here's your badge. Oh, yes. Now, as we covered in the training session, the key is to follow that script. If the car won't start, there's a script for that. If the vehicle needs to be towed, there's a script for that. If the client wants road side assistance- Is there a script for that? I like you already, Jeff. Hey. Ah, thank you. Alright, now these I've written most of them myself so I know that they work. They have been tested in both real life situations and in stress test simulations. Woah. Yep. It certainly looks thorough. What? It actually looks thin. Hang on. Thin? Yeah. Oh, darn it. Yeah, no, this is the old copy. Let me get you the new version with a full appendix. Please. Please do. Hit me! Dealer busts! I love this game. Ok Celia, I've got road side services on the way. Yeah, just try to remain calm. Again, my name is Tom and I'll be here until assistance arrives. I thought you were my boss, man. You must be the new guy. Tom Perkins. Jeff Gates. Wow, you look fancy. I haven't worn a suit in, I don't know, maybe a decade? Really? I'm just kinda used to wearing suits to the office. Is uh, is this too much? Where'd you work before? I was in advertising. Advertising, huh? Yeah. Why'd you wind up here? I wanted to help people. Well, isn't that nobel. I guess. Ok Celia, I've got road side services on the way. Yeah, just try to remain calm. My name is Tom and I will be here until assistance arrives. So we need to accrue the interest expense on the bank loan, the wages earned by the employees and the interest the company earned on their certificate of deposit, and then we need to prepare an accrual-type adjustment entry for the revenue we earned based on our services even though our clients are gonna be billing... Is this seat taken? What? I mean, do you mind if I sit here? Yes I do. I'm expecting someone. Oh, ok. Um, would you please leave? I actually reserved this table. Oh. It's ok. I'll get up as soon as your friend comes. Are they late? I'm actually not waiting for someone. Really? Yeah, I'm... you're not gonna believe this. You're spying on somebody, aren't you? Yeah. I wouldn't use the term "spying". You set them up on a date and now you want to see how it goes. Yeah, how'd you know? I'm actually here for the same reason. You are? Yeah. Where's your friend? Not here yet. Yours? Over there. I mean, there's a lot more to it than that. Like I said, it's actually like only a third of it. It's funny how figures of speech... The guy in the blue sweater vest? Yeah, so? He's perfectly nice. That is a bold choice for a first date. Did you want to get a dessert? I still haven't had a chance to tell you about the deferrals we've been working on at the office. Uh, you know, I actually have a client meeting early in the morning and- Yes. You know, get some sleep. Yeah. Okey dokey. Fresh. Totally understand that. Yeah. I should probably get to the office early, too. Ok. Thanks. Thank you. You're welcome. Hi. Table for two under Jeff. Your date's already seated. That one? You're cute! So... how was it? You should know, you were there, weren't you? Who's that guy you were with? Well, Frank's a nice guy. A perfectly decent, sweet guy. I'm sure he is. We just had no chemistry. Well, he's got a great job. Yes, I know all about his job. Ok, well dating is a numbers game. Let me make it up to you. No. I really want to focus on work right now. I'm going to Susan's. Wish me luck. I can do this. Yeah! Ok. Oh... Help! ( navigation system ) Autocall customer hotline. Uh, our sensors indicate that your airbag has deployed. Is everything ok? I'm fine but I got in an accident and my ankle is stuck and I need help. Uh, ok ma'am, so everything is gonna be ok. I am gonna call emergency services for you, alright? Thank you. One moment. Ok, ma'am. Emergency services have been called. Thank you. Help is on the way. Great. Could you uh, could you stay on the phone with me for, just for a little bit, until they get here? Yeah, of course. Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. The first time anything like this has ever happened to me. Uh, well, I mean that's a... that's a good thing that it's never happened before, right? Um, so my name is Jeff, what's yours? Kelly. Kelly. Ok, Kelly, well someone will be there soon. In the meantime is there anything that I can do to make things just a little easier for you? No, there's nothing. I'm just... just super embarrassed. That's ridiculous, you have nothing to be embarrassed about. Ok, just tell me something happy. Uh, like can you tell me about your family? Well, my parents are back east and my ex-fiancee cheated on me, so not exactly happy thoughts, Jeff. Ok, I- I'm sorry, that was- that was uh, stupid. Let's try something else. How about your hobbies. What do you like to do for fun? I like to watch old movies. Like black and white romantic comedies, musicals, film noir, that kind of thing. I've never seen a black and white movie I don't think. You've never seen a black and white movie? That's... you're missing out. Well, I guess I'll have to do something about that then. Um, I like to read. That's what I do, I like to read. A reader, huh? Reading anything good right now? It's kind of embarrassing so I don't want to talk about it. No, you can't say anything about being embarrassed. I got into a car accident. You have to tell me, it'll make me feel better. Alright, fine. Uh, it's a sci-fi book, I'm- I'm sure that you've never heard of it but it's called Mandroid-- Mandroid Time Machine? Mandroid Time Machine, yeah! How do you know it? You know they're making it into a movie? Wow, I didn't know that. Well, you're really good at your job 'cause this is helping. Oh, thank you. Uh, that's- that's really great to hear. I'm actually kinda new at this. Really? Am I your first emergency? First? No, no, no. I mean, just this morning alone I happen to have rescued a piece of paper from a jammed printer, so... You're funny. I bet you make your wife laugh a lot. Oh, I'm not married. I mean, I was but uh, but she passed away a few years ago. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... No, no, no. Please, I uh... you didn't know. Don't worry about it. Just helping was gratifying enough. That's how I feel about my job, you know? It's like, you know, turning someone's home into like this nice, cozy, warm, comfortable place where they like living. You know, I could actually use some tips uh, on how to liven up my cubicle here. All I have right now is a fern. I was about to suggest maidenhair ferns to my client today. But hey, now I know you've got great taste. Uh, Jeff? Yeah, Kelly? I uh, don't think I need emergency services anymore. Really? I thought you were stuck. Are you not stuck? I thought so, too, but... I guess I just panicked. Are you sure you just want the tow truck and not emergency services? No, thank you for everything. Ok, ok. Well, uh... ( stuttering ) it was really nice helping you. Uh, have a great day, Kelly. You too, Jeff. Yes, very nice! Solid. I would have asked for her number, but... Hey, now don't listen to him. I thought we had an appointment. I saw her leave the office, she had everything prepared. This is so not like her, she's always punctual. I can assure you this isn't typical. We do not conduct business this way. So where is she? I just tried calling her and she didn't pick up. So... do you have any budget questions? I can't wait for her all day. I'm sure she'll turn up soon. Oh. Mrs. Meyer. Hi. Uh, come in. Are you ok? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It's uh... nothing. I'm so sorry about being late. It's a funny story, actually- I'm sorry Kelly, I just- I don't have that much time so I'm just gonna show you the house. Yeah, yeah. Alright, well um... ok, that's the living room, so what would you do there? Well, based on the floors and the light, probably play up the natural elements with some wood accents, some- some maidenhair ferns actually might look nice. Huh. That sounds... interesting, but I think I'd have to see it first. Oh, yeah, yeah. For sure. I can go to the office right now, now that I've seen the space and, you know, just do the mock-ups. Alright, well that sounds fine. Unfortunately I just don't have much time right now. Oh, yeah. Sure. Um, and again, I'm so sorry. There you go, rescue man. Man, it was so cool. This- this total stranger was trapped and unsure and scared and all I did was talk to her for a few minutes and I was able to help. Wow. You're like a real life superhero. Mmm, I am like a real life superhero. How does it feel to be in the presence of such greatness? It's intimidating. I'll bet it is. So Larry strong-armed me into a meeting. Your old boss? Yeah. Said he wanted to have a quick chat or whatever that might mean. It's nothing the Rescue Man can't handle. I like your style. Alright. See you later. Ugh. Alright, just sit down and relax. The doctor said icing and elevating should do the trick. Ok, I'll be right back. It should be better by tomorrow. Are you ok, Kelly? Yeah, yeah. I was just uh, thinking about the accident. Ah, trauma. The gift that keeps on giving. No, I was thinking about the Autocall guy. Oh. Yeah, he was really nice. I'm glad he was doing his job. And really funny. I think they read from a script. No, this was different. We were... I don't know, just talking about everything. Just an honest conversation. We had a connection. It was- it was weird. It was weird, I didn't expect it. Do you have a crush on this guy? No, that would be crazy. He was just really reassuring in my time of need. Well, I'm sure his wife thinks so, too. Well, he's a widower, so... It just came up in conversation. Well maybe you'll get into another accident and you two can go on a second date. Stop. He probably lives in Kansas or... I hear Kansas is beautiful this time of year. Conversation is over. Ah, I'm just glad you're ok. There you go. No, no, aagh! There you go, champ. Good job. You know, a lot of the clients have been asking about you. Yeah? What'd you tell them? I told them you gave up a co-partnership for an exciting new career venture in emergency road side assistance. Jeez, when you put it that way... No, I'm kidding. I told them that you're taking a little time off and that uh, you'll be coming back real soon. Am I right? I don't know, Larry. Come on, let's go inside and chat. Well, it's great to have you back in the office. Everybody misses you, including myself. That's very nice to hear, thank you. By the way, we just happened to land the Banning Energy Tea deal. Hey, that's great news. Congrats. And I'm thinking about doing a taste test campaign. What? Really? A taste test? What is this, the early '90s? No, you need to start with a series of fresh ads in the offices of young, hip businesses. You know, hit that early twenties demographic with a campaign of young, successful people drinking Banning Energy Tea, they're- they're talking about their weekend. They're making plans, they're flirting, they're laughing. You know? It should feel like a fun-loving party but with a touch of class. I fell right into that, didn't I? You could do a taste test, too... Alright, alright, alright, alright. Listen, it was great to see you, I do have to take off. It's a bit of a day for me. Of course. Of course. Hey, Jeff. If I haven't been explicitly clear, your job is waiting for you here. Well, I appreciate that, Larry, thank you. At least sleep on it, ok? I will. Autocall 24 hour customer hotline, this is Darlene. How can I assist you this evening? Hi, Darlene. I uh, I was talking to Jeff earlier, I don't know if he works this late or if I could get his... Jeff who? Jeff... I- I actually don't know his last name. It's slipping my mind. Oh gosh. Unfortunately I'm not sure how to assist you with that. Our company is nation-wide. In fact I'm calling you from Kansas. Kansas. I knew it. Well, we have locations across the country so it'd be really hard to find the Jeff that spoke to you today. Is there a way to check my call history? Mmmhmm. All of that information is stored in your car so you'd have to call through your vehicle. It was a rental, I don't have it anymore. Oh gosh. Ma'am, they usually wipe that information after each new renter. Sorry. Ok, well uh- well, thank you so much for your help, Darlene, and have a great night. I'll get a large iced latte with... oh, it's you. It's me. The guy who busted my cover. Guilty. It's not funny. My friend was actually mad about that, you know. I can't take all of the blame. Your hiding skills were extremely sub-par. One large iced latte? Yeah. On me. Oh, ok. I'll bring it to your table. Looks like our boy's not in Kansas after all. What was that? Nothing. I didn't know work could make someone that excited. I recognize that glint in the eye. You're stalking someone, aren't you? It's not stalking if it's for a friend. I don't remember that in the stalker's manual. What chapter was that? Very funny. I'm just doing a little fact-finding. Everybody does it nowadays. Are you this diligent about everything that you do? I like to think so, but for some reason I can't seem to get rid of you. Well, you are charming. Good luck with your research. ( movie ) Orderly. Orderly... Ok, call log. 2:02pm, 3:15, 3:46... that's gotta be it. Ok, uh... what am I gonna say? "Hi Kelly, this is Jeff from Autocall. I'm just calling because I wanted to do my job, make sure you're ok. How's the ankle? Good? Good. You know, this might be out of the blue, but uh, how would you like to get a cup of coffee with me sometime? Oh you would? Oh, you were going to ask me that? That- that is just too funny." That is just- you're an idiot. Hello? ( automated answer ) The Autocall vehicle you have called is not in service at this time. You are an idiot. Your call is not in service. My brain is not in service. Go to bed, Jeff. Go to bed. Come on, fold. Hi. Can I help you? Yes, I'm here to see Jeff. Jeff? Yes. Ok, do you have an appointment? So he does work here. Pardon? Look, my friend got into an accident and a lovely operator named Jeff helped her. Ok. We just wanted to thank him. So, could I talk to him? Just for a minute. Uh, yeah, no. Not without an appointment. Is there any way you could give us his last name, or...? I'm sorry, ma'am. Employee information is strictly confidential. But I was hoping maybe you could make an exception. Company policy, nothing more I can do. Autocall Portland, how may I direct your call? Please hold. I know you're just doing your job, but woman to woman? I'll tell you what. Why don't you put your information down right here and I will do my best to pass it along. I've fallen for that before. My note will magically disappear. I know how this works. I'm sorry, ma'am. There's nothing more I can do. Fine. I'll just have to do it myself. No, ma'am, you cannot go up there! Excuse me! Hi, I have a situation in the lobby, I've got a woman running up to the main office. So we go from this... to this. Huh. It's interesting. The natural and organic elements can bring a sense of peace and well-being to a space so we wanna use materials like wood, leather, cotton, seagrass. Is that brick? Yes. That's actually my favourite part. Um, we put the brick in there as a back drop and a focal point. It's just gonna bring a lot of colour and texture to the room. I think I like it. I'm- I'm just a little hesitant after our last meeting. I understand, and I can assure you that- I've just set up some other meetings with other designers just to see what ideas are out there. Yeah. Yeah. Totally understand. Yeah. So can I keep these? Sure. Alright, I'll be in touch. Thank you. Thanks for all your hard work. No, thank you. Excuse me? Hey, Tom. Uh... Oh, nice cowboy boots. Oh, yeah. Thanks. See, I uh- Yeah, right. Listen, um, my friend Kelly's rental car slid down a hill Tuesday afternoon. One of your co-workers helped rescue her. I know this is a big place, I- Jeff, right? Wow! You know him? I'm in the cubicle next to him. I heard the whole thing. Amazing. Listen, what's he like? Tall? Short? Handsome? Kinda tall, he's a pretty good looking guy. So this is my friend Kelly. Wow. Wow, she is cute. Right? And you're only seeing her from a photo. In person she's a total knock-out. Huh. So, this Jeff guy, is he really a widower? Woah, what's going on here? Nothing. Kelly just thought Jeff was a nice guy- Why is a chick that hot still single? What's... what's her deal? She went through a rough break-up a little while ago. The whole dating thing's been kinda hard for her. I just figured they're both single, they seemed to hit it off. It could be fate. Isn't fate supposed to happen on its own? Like the whole thing? You're not supposed to plan it? Sometimes fate just needs a swift kick in the rear. Can I see your phone? Sure. Alright. Here is Kelly's number. Please give it to Jeff. How was the meeting? Um, oh, she liked it but she's meeting with other designers. Ah, that's ok. Most clients do, they just don't usually tell us. Only time will tell, I guess. Uh, where were you? Well, I've got some news. You're either going to love me or hate me after I tell you. Well, that doesn't sound good. I went to Autocall. What? I did some research and found out there's a call centre in town. Tell me you didn't talk to Jeff. No, but I did talk to this guy Tom, who, get this: sits one cubicle away from Jeff and heard your whole conversation. And? I gave him your number. He said he's going to give it to Jeff later today. You didn't. I did. That is humiliating. He's gonna think I'm desperate, he's never gonna call me. Ugh. I thought you'd be happy. This is great news. The guy you spoke to is not in Kansas, he's here. A 15 minute drive away from the office and he's going to call you. Didn't you say he was nice and funny and you thought you had this connection and opportunity knocks and you're upset. Yes, but opportunity didn't knock, Rachel, you did. Ah, semantics. You're gonna thank me later. Now how about we get back to decorating some houses, huh? Oh, hey Jeff. Hey Laurie. Looking forward to hearing more of your phone calls. Thanks, I appreciate that. You know, I kinda thrive on the audience. Autocall customer hotline, how may I help you? Ok sir, emergency services are on route to you now and I'll hang on the line until they arrive. I wasn't insinuating that you need a babysitter, just company protocol, and I wanna help. Sir? The pain in your throat was caused by a collision? You- you think you have a cold? Yeah, no idea. I recommend calling a doctor. You want me to order you a pizza while you wait for the tow truck? No, I'm sorry. I can't- I can't do that. Sorry for the inconvenience. Don't do that! What are you, crazy? No, don't. Don't. Don't- Everything ok? This guy. This guy, he just went in with a pair of threes. Can you believe this? Slow day? No, not really. You know, some of these calls are just- Ridiculous? Yeah, I know. What'd you expect? To save someone every ten minutes? Maybe not every ten, but... People avoid more accidents than they get into. They look up at the last minute, they swerve and they're fine. Even minor accidents, you know? They don't even feel the need to call. I don't know, it's just... yesterday, that call with Kelly, I mean, the whole thing was kind of amazing. She was your first. You'll always remember your first. Nah, that can't be it. And you know, besides, I took this job to help people, not order their pizza. You do help people. You unlock their cars. You direct them to the nearest gas station. You diagnose their vehicles. And every once in a while you get to assist in an actual road side emergency, none of which are usually very serious, thankfully. But that's what you signed up for. You know what? Hey, come on. Let's go to lunch, alright? I have some news that will lift your spirits. I can't believe she wants to go out with me. You must have known that she liked you. I mean, I thought she did but going out on a date is a whole other ballgame. I don't even know her last name. Yeah, that's why you go on the date. To get to know each other. I don't know. I don't know. What don't you know? She's smokin' hot and she wants you to call her. I don't know. It's been a long time since I've been in the dating game. I mean, what if I don't live up to her expectations? She likes me because of that phone call. I'm a lot less smooth on dates than I was on that phone call. Good-looking women do not wait. I've learned that your window of opportunity shrinks in direct comparison to their hotness. Which gives you about you need to call her soon. Ok. You know, I'm gonna give you her number and you are gonna call her. No, no, no. Yes. Tonight. Oh, tonight. Hah, no pressure. Yeucch. What? I can't believe you're gonna eat that. Oh, that's nice. You know what? Now I can't eat the doughnuts. Cro-nuts. Whatever. You catch that one? Too bad you can't do that on the course where it actually counts. Ooh. Trash talk already, huh? Yeah. Mmmhmm. Wow, your game is rounding out nicely, isn't it? At least, for the record, I can do that on the course. Where it counts. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. So, uh... three years ago today, huh? Yeah. You know, it took my mom almost four years after my dad died to finally sleep in the middle of the bed. I'm sensing a comparison coming on here. She realized that accepting the fact that he was gone wasn't abandoning him. I haven't abandoned Cassie. I know. Not with this new job dedicated to her memory. Look, I'm just saying Cassie would have wanted you to find someone special. She wouldn't want your life to end just because hers did. I appreciate that. I do. But you have got to stop worrying about me. I'm fine. And I have actually been easing my way back into the dating I'll have you know. That one date I set you up on does not count. There are others. Let's pretend I believe that. Did they ask about the wedding ring? It's a process. It's a slow process. I'm gonna let you in on something here. I actually got a number today. You got a number? I did. Oh my goodness. So after we're done here I'm gonna call her, I'll ask her out. How do you like that? You're gonna call her on the phone? Yeah, I sure am. Great, now can you stop worrying about me and focus on the ball? I don't focus on the ball, the ball needs to focus on me. What does that mean? Here we go, one, two, three. Wow. It's still there. Hello? Jeff? Tomorrow? No, no I have no plans, that sounds- yes. Dinner sounds... sounds amazing. Uh, ok, yeah. I'm looking forward to it, too. Ok, bye. Yeah. Hi Jeff. This is so crazy. It's so nice to meet you in person. Yes, they are natural. No, you are! Hi. Hi. Hi, Kelly? Hi. Remember me? Very funny. Nice to finally meet you. Nice to finally meet you too, Jeff. Um, I'm just going to put them in some water. Sure, sure, yeah. Go, go, go! No! Oh, just checking the scores real quick. Those are nice cowboy boots. Yeah. Are you from the south? No, no. I just uh, like 'em. Shall we go? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure. Waiter! You're spying on me, aren't you? And why would I be spying on you? Because I'm your competition. I reserve the tables with the best views of other tables. And what are you doing here? Catering. I'm trying to branch out. I want the Watershed Arts Cafe to be more than just a neighbourhood coffee shop. Wow, that's really cool. This is a great place to start. Thank you. Uh, so if you're not stalking me, what're you doing here? My partner and I decorated this place, but she's- On a date? Yes, as a matter of fact she is. Well I'm surprised you're able to pry yourself away. Mmm. You want anything to drink? Um, I'm ok. Ok, um... I gotta take these in because these coffees are in high demand. Oh, ok. Catch you later. See ya. I couldn't help but overhear that you used to work in advertising. Yes. Yeah, actually ever since college advertising was my work and my passion, and then I decided to try something different. That's cool. Thanks. Are you liking it so far? Yeah. What about you? You still like it? Oh, well I've been working at Autocall since I graduated and, I mean, I like it. It's easy, I don't need my career to be my life or anything. I kinda like clocking out at 5pm, going out, having some fun, leaving the work at the office. You know? Mmm. It's really nice here. Mmmhmm. Mmmhmm. Yeah. I really like science fiction. Really? Yeah, I could stay up all night reading it. Oh. I sure hope they seat us soon. I didn't realize we had to have a reservation. It's weird. Your voice sounds so different in person. It's the head sets. They distort everything. Your voice actually sounds really different, too. Really? Yeah. Oh. I guess that kinda makes sense. It totally makes sense. So how's um... what do you like to do for fun? Oh, I've got something. Mmmhmm. You have to promise that you won't tell anyone at the office. Ok. I am mildly addicted to online poker. Really? Yeah. And here's the thing, I'm actually like really, really good at it. Where are you from? I am from a small town in Nevada just south of Vegas. I used to go up there with my buddies all the time and gamble and party. That was really good times. Lemon wedge. Do you... um, you wanna ask me something? You can ask me something. Yes, right. Of course, of course. Um, I have a question for you. Um, how'd you get to be so beautiful? Um... Oh gosh, where is that waiter with my lemon wedges? I'll go get him for you. Ok. I am gonna go check on le table. Excuse me- woah, I'm sorry, sorry. I'm very sorry, I'm... No, no, no. It's- Very clumsy. I'm- I'm clumsy, too. So it's... I get it. Excuse me, can I get some lemon wedges please? Thank you. Thank you. Do you want to go someplace else? This place sucks. Um, I think... I just want to go home, actually. I have an early client meeting in the morning, and I just- Ah ah, home. I gotcha. Well, I had a great time. You did? Yeah, didn't you? Well... I... seriou- no! Look, I don't know how to tell you this but you're just not the guy I thought you were. And it's not your fault, it's no one's fault, really, I just... I'm... I'm really sorry- That you lost your wife and... and I just- I hope you find someone special! I can see you through the glass. Well, um... thank you for taking me out and for uh... and for the beautiful flowers. Of course. Thanks for coming. We didn't really click tonight, did we? No! We definitely did not. I think you're great, though. I think you're great, too. Well. See you at work. See you there. Alright. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hey. You thirsty? No, I'm ok. You know, you really look like you're having a blast. I think you really know how to let your hair down. I'm just worried about my friend's date. You know, I'm sure she's having a good time, as you should be because we are at a party. I know, I know. It's just... my friend, her ex cheated on her and she's an amazing person. We've known each other since we were kids and we have a business together. I just care about her a lot. I want her to be happy. And besides, what if she needs me to pretend to be sick so she has an excuse to leave? I prepared with a fake cough and everything. Wait a second, women actually do that? Yeah. Only if the date's really bad. So when that girl said she had to leave because her friend's grandma died, that was... Oh, ouch. Wow. Sorry. Yeah. Hey, can I say something? By all means. I just think you need to let yourself have a little fun. You know? You can't neglect your own happiness just because you're trying to take care of everybody else. Ok. What did you have in mind? Why don't you leave your phone with me, I'll let you know if she texts. If she calls. If she needs a cough escape. I don't know, I mean... Come on. Ok. Ok. There you go. Hey. You look stressed, Rescue Man. What's ailing you? I don't know, maybe that first call was a fluke. I mean, it's just not what I expected. I'm just... I don't know. I'm not as thrilled about it anymore. Well, lucky for you there's another offer waiting on the table if you wanna take it. Here. Hey. Oh, hey sleepyhead. I want details. Raise your right hand. Raise it. Ok, but... Repeat after me. I, Rachel Fowler. I, Rachel Fowler. Do solemnly swear to keep my nose out of Kelly's business. Do solemnly swear to keep my nose out of Kelly's business. And refrain from matchmaking of any form. Ugh! And refrain from matchmaking of any form. Great. Ok. Everything is going to be fine, please try to remain calm. Emergency services will arrive shortly. Yes, I suppose you're right, emergency services aren't exactly necessary for keys locked in the trunk. I'll take care of that for you. Hey Jeff. Hey Laurie. Hey Tom. Hey. Wow, it must have been a hot date. Go back to your poker game, Tom. But she's gorgeous. What happened? Just didn't click. Simple as that. You know, you should ask her out. You guys have a lot in common. Really? Yep. I always thought of myself as a looker, but I thought she might have been out of my league. Can't hurt to try. Yeah, maybe. Autocall, this is Jeff, how may I assist you today? Uh, I must have hit a button by accident. I'm sorry, who am I speaking with? Oh, well, this is Darryl, why? Who's this? This is Jeff from Autocall. Is there a woman named Kelly in the car with you? Is this one of those prank shows? Where's the car cam? Because, you guys... No, it's- it's not. I was just checking in on another Autocall customer I assisted last week. Oh, well I just rented this car from U-Rent so it might have been the person who had it before me? Oh, it's a rental. Man, it would have been cool if it was one of those prank show though, huh? Yeah, totally. Ok, have a nice day. You too. Alright. Hey, Tom? ( wakes up ) This is Tom from Autocall, how may I assist- Cover my desk, I'm taking my 15 minutes. Yeah, yeah. I got it. No! Ugh. Why does this keep happening? What is it? Our internet is down again and I still have a bunch of stuff to look up for Susan for tomorrow. Well, I'll call the provider. Why don't you try the coffee shop down the street? They have free wifi. No, I don't like working in cafes. It's too distracting. Just try. Plus there's a really cute guy that runs the place. Rachel. You made a solemn vow to stop setting me up. No, not for you. This time the guy might be for me. Well, I suddenly feel like a fresh cup of coffee. Hi. Hi, how can I help you? Yes, thank you. My fr- girlfriend uh, wanted an invoice from her car rental. She rented a car here last week. Sure. What's her name? Kelly...? Kelly. Does she have a last name? Ke- Kel- She doesn't have a last name? No, she- like, like Madonna. She has no last name. It's just Kelly. Ok, what? Ok, I'm gonna tell you the truth now, just promise you won't think I'm crazy. Wow, ok. I'm gonna let myself out. Thank you. Oh boy. Susan, hi. I was just going over some accent options for your place. I think you're really gonna love this colour contrast I just came up with. Uh, look. I have some bad news for you. I've decided to go with a different design firm. Uh, can I ask why? You have some great ideas and I really admire your innate design sense. I'm just worried that your experience level isn't there. I just found the most beautiful decorative pillows that just would have complimented that brick wall perfectly. Well, I did love your brick design accents. And I found this stunning claw-foot bathtub for the upstairs bathroom, it's a vintage Richard Claris. Really? Where'd you find one of those? Estate sale, but I guess I'll have to hold onto it for another client. How about you come in and run me through the rest of your ideas? Of course. Yes. I'm looking forward to it. See you soon. Autocall customer hotline, this is Jeff, how may I assist you? You can assist me by taking your old job back. Larry? Have you thought about the offer? I'm still thinking about it. Yeah, well we had some interviews today, one guy in particular is a really good candidate. He's hungry. He wants it. Oh yeah? So why are you calling me? I liked your idea about the Banning Energy Tea campaign. Oh, Lar I was just spitballing. My point exactly. You're a natural ad man, Jeff. It's second nature to you. Well, I'm happy to help. I don't want your help. We want you back, the whole team does. I had a courier drop off an envelope for you today at the office. Did you get it? Uh, an envelope. No. No. Uh, Larry I'm not seeing any envelope. Sorry. Your face. You're terrific. I know. Jeff, you there? Yeah, sorry Lar, it was uh- just found the opened envelope. Well, it comes with a substantial bonus from your old salary and some extra benefits, too. Look, Jeff. I know it's never been about the money for you, but I just wanted to show you how much we do care. Larry, I- No, no, no. Don't answer me now, ok? Look it over, take some time and think about it. And by "time" I mean by tomorrow. Business is booming, we need a co-partner. I need a co-partner. Alright, well thanks Lar, I appreciate it. I'll take a look. Well, that was my pitch. What do you think? Not bad for an old guy, huh? Yeah, not bad at all, Larry. You still got it. We'll talk soon, Jeff. See ya. Hey. Hey, man. How was work today? More of the same. You uh, thought any more about Larry's job offer? Still considering it. How about your social life? Gone on any more dates? No, but Zack, can you help this customer? Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry about it. You're just gonna have to excuse my friend, he is so busy worrying about my life that he forgets to do his own job. Can I get you anything? Uh, I'd love a decaf latte please? I gotcha. Decaf, huh? Yeah, I- I get- I'm jittery right now from this meeting so I try not to have caffeine. Good thinking. What's in the envelope? Oh, I'm- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked that. No, no, no. That's fine. That's personal. I just- you kinda lit up when you opened it, but you don't have to tell me, that was... No, it's- it's um, a job offer from the place I used to work. A job offer from the place you used to work? Yeah, I realize now that makes no sense, does it? They're um... thanks, Zack. Thank you. Um, just- they're trying to woo and pursue me to return, I guess. Ah. Sorry, I shouldn't have asked. It's ok. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted. Nice to have so many options. What are you working on? Um, this is just uh, well it's a new design for this client. Um, I'm an interior designer. Huh. I seem to be meeting a lot of those lately. Yeah? Well, you probably met my competition. This client is shopping the job out to other companies. May I? Uh, sure. Yeah. So I was going for more of a natural, organic feel. I mean, it looks great. Yeah. And are those maidenhair ferns? Yeah, I just really find they can really brighten up a space. Oh, I know. I have one in my cubicle at work. Really? Yeah. Oh. I'm sold. I'd hire you in a heartbeat. Oh, thank you. Yeah. This is gonna sound strange, it's not a line. Have we met? I was thinking the same thing. Really? You- you look and you sound- you just feel very familiar. Yeah, I mean you do, too. I'm not sure though, I can't place you. Are you a regular here? No, no, this is my first time. Ok. Have you been to that Italian restaurant across the street? I was there the other night. You're the guy at the bar. The bar? Yes. Lemon wedges. You bumped into me. ( laughs ) Oh my gosh, the lemon wedges. Yeah. Yeah, that's me. Great memory. Thank you. Yeah. Not a great night for me. No, me neither, actually. Well, I'm sorry for both of us. I'm glad I figured that out, honestly. That would have driven me crazy. Yeah. I'm Jeff, by the way. Now that is just bizarre. When I was at the Italian restaurant I was on a date with another Jeff. No kidding? Yeah. Was he awesome? He was not. Not for you, huh? No. I totally get that. I'm sorry, what was your name? It's Kelly. Kelly. And you're married. I'm sorry? Of course, I just... I actually have to get going. I didn't- Ke- Oh! Oh, no, no, no. This is not what it looks like. Have you ever been cheated on? My ex-fiancee cheated on me. Men like you make me sick. Please, listen- listen to me for a sec! I'm- I'm not married! Kelly! Kelly. What? Zack, the woman sitting there, the one I was just talking to, her name is Kelly. She's an interior designer who likes ferns and her ex-fiancee cheated on her. The Autocall girl. Thank you for coming. Of course. That's what best friends and business partners are for. Are you ok? No, I'm not ok. There is something really wrong with the universe. I meet this guy at the cafe and he's there and I'm there and we're like hitting it off and then- and then we think we know each other but we're not sure but we like think we do and then we find out we do and then bam. He's married. Yes, he's married. I couldn't believe he tried to take off his wedding ring. I just don't think it's in the cards for me. That's not true. You deserve something real and special. Ok? You just gotta be patient. Aaah! You scared me! You are never gonna believe this. You remember that girl that I helped save, the one who's car slid down the hill? No, I don't... Tom! My first. Focus. Your first. Yes, right. There we go. Ok, so anyhow, I meet this woman yesterday, everything feels weirdly familiar. I can't figure out why. Then I figure out why! It was her! It was Kelly! Kelly? You met Kelly? Yeah. Yes, I mean, that's pretty unbelievable, right? Yeah, I literally don't believe you. Tom, she left. She ran out, I ran out after her and she was gone. Oh, so you never confirmed that it was actually THE Kelly? No, but... It was her. She- she- she- her name is Kelly she's an interior designer, I mean, there were other things. I'm 99.9% sure it was Kelly. That 0.1% has to be a factor here, man. I mean, you don't even know for sure it was the chick from the accident. No, no, no. Her voice, her laugh, I mean... Come on. I don't want to be a downer, but you talked to her over the phone for a couple minutes like a few weeks ago? Ok, I need you to help me with something though. You know how they log our calls, right? Well, I found her number, I called it, it's a rental car. So I don't have her name, I don't have her contact information, but that has to be stored somewhere, right? I mean, it has to be filed. Yeah, the guys on the third floor handle that. But it's all highly confidential. They don't just give that information out. It's a breach of- Confidentiality, Tom. This is great, I'm going up to the third floor. I'm gonna find this girl. No, no, no. Wait, hey, hey. You know what? I have a friend up there, a really good friend. I'll see what I can do. They'll help me because I've been here for longer. Yeah? Yeah. That is really cool of you. I owe you one. ( laughs ) No, pff. Yeah, you do. Ok, I'm gonna go check that out. Alright, alright, alright. Ok. BRB. BRB. BRB. Yeah. Yessss. Feeling better? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I am. Let's seal the deal with the Meyer house. So I think if we focus on the rounded archways and the older architecture and then play that up with some vintage furniture, I think it could be something really special. What do you think? I love that. And if we can incorporate antiques from the flea market, it'll fit nicely within their budget. Yeah. I just have to re-organize the pitch of it, practice, 'cause we only have a few days prep before we gotta blow her away. Honestly, she'd be crazy not to hire us, we have the perfect aesthetic for her house. Listen to this: "Remain patient, your future will soon brighten. Exciting times are just around the corner." What is that? Your daily horoscope. Huh. What's yours? "Remain patient, your future will soon brighten. Exciting times are just around the corner." Yeah. Well? I don't know how to tell you this. There was some kind of computer glitch and last week's records were completely erased. Erased, erased? No, no, no, no, no. They have a back-up system for these kind of things, right? Yeah. Great. But no. What? They were installing some kind of new system and it crashed before they could put up the safe guard. I'm gonna go talk to them. No, no, no. It's chaos up there. You don't understand- People are scrambling around trying to save- This is the only way I'm gonna be able to find the girl- Their jobs. You will just aggravate the situation. So that's it? That's it. Sorry man. ( slow jazz music ) ♪♪ Hey. Hey. What brings you back to my neck of the woods? More work? I wanted to thank you for babysitting my phone the other night. Once I stopped worrying about my friend I had a good time. I'm glad. What's this? Sometimes we stage open houses. One of our clients was looking for a caterer. I recommended you. That's the offer letter. This is amazing. Thank you. Yeah, and if all goes well maybe we can make it a regular thing. Doing business together, I mean. Speaking of business, my friend has another date at the Italian spot tomorrow night, I could really use your expertise. Are you busy? I never say no to a night of espionage. I have to say I am a little disappointed in you, Jeff. I thought you had a lot of potential. Well, thanks, Dave. I'm sorry to let you down. I never really understood why you wanted to work here in the first place. Why do you like working here, Dave? Well, it's the binders mostly. Do you have any idea how satisfying it is to fill those every day? No, I don't. But you are really good at it. Thank you. Sure. So humour me. Why did you want to work here? I- I just really wanted to find a way to help people. Do you feel like you did? Well, I definitely helped one person. Maybe that's enough. Bye guys. See ya. Well, Thomas, very nice of you to walk- Me out. Oh, come on, are you kidding? I wouldn't let my best work bud leave without a proper goodbye. Plus, it's the best excuse to leave my desk. Right. Wha- no, no, no. No! No! I lost again. Yes! Woo! Oh yeah! Laurie? Uh huh? Did you just give a victory shout? I did. Wait a second, was that you? Losing? Please tell me you're not PokerPartier888? SpeakYGoneIsYourMoney? No way. No way! You kill at poker. You went all in with 3s! Who does that? I know! You didn't think you'd lose to a girl, did you? No. I didn't. It's strangely hot. Told you you had a lot in common. I can't believe we've been playing each other this whole time. I know. Ok folks, well I'm taking off, so good luck with everything. Yeah, take care, Jeff. Alright. Here's my badge. Bye, Jeff. Bye, Laurie. Oh, hey, Jeff. Uh, about Kelly. Ah, may lady luck be on your side. So, do you want to go for dinner sometime? Oh my gosh, forget dinner, let's go to Vegas. Yes! I thought you would never ask! So where's your friend? Uh, not here yet. Soon though. Ok, well, how can I help? I'm not sure. I'm really good at reading people. What do you mean? Let me show you. Uh, ok. Look at that couple over there. I'd say they're on a first date. She's into him but he's not into her. What makes you say that? Body language. He's sitting far away, not making eye contact, he's fidgeting like he already wants to leave. Um, maybe he's just nervous. You know, like it could be his first first date in a while. At least one that matters, so he wants to make a good impression. How do you know all that? Lucky guess. Well, even if he is nervous, when you want something you gotta go after it. You can't let nerves get in the way, especially when it comes to love. There is no date. What? I- I made it up in order to get you to go out with me. So you lured me here under the pretense that we would be spying? Yes. That is just totally... something I would do. What? I love it. Now I'm thinking we should start with garlic bread. What are your thoughts? Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Ok. Oh man. That's a good trick. You sly fox. Uh huh. You had me for a second. I did. That was- I thought you were gonna leave. You should have seen your face. ( movie plays ) ...I don't know what I want. ( movie plays ) He has everything, Francois. ( movie continues in background ) Here we go, a nice corner office, huh? Well? What do you think? It's great, Larry. Thank you. You're welcome. You know, I don't like talking about it but I just... I feel like I owe you an explanation. It's ok. When Cassie died... I don't know if you know but she crashed her car into... into a remote area and was undiscovered for 24 hours. If they had found her in time she'd probably still be here today. And I just- I felt so helpless that I wasn't able to help the person I loved the most. I thought that Autocall was sort of my chance to not get her back but to just help prevent people from going through what she did. What I did. It wasn't what I expected. It did give me some closure. Thanks for your patience. Wow. Hey, Jeff. It's good to have you back. It's good to be back. Look, you get to work. I will. Good. Special thanks again to the folks at Banning Energy Tea for putting your confidence in us. We at Fitz and Dunn look forward to making you an awful lot of money. Thank you. Jeff. Just got back in the game and already a slam dunk. Excellent work. You know, it was nothing. Yeah. No, it wasn't. Hi, this is Jeff Gates. Uh, I'm hoping this is the same Kelly I met at Water Shed Arts Cafe. Hi, Kelly? Hi, my name is Jeff Gates. I'm wondering if we met at Water Shed Arts Cafe? Hi, can I speak to Kelly? Ok, well can you tell her Jeff called? Um, if it is the right Kelly I'd really love to talk. Maybe explain myself. Hmm? No, no, this isn't Maurice. Um, please call me at 503-555-0199. No, this- no, this is not a solicitation. No, Maurice didn't put me up to this. Hello? Gone. Hey, Jeff? We're all set for the meeting. Meeting, yes. Be right there. Good stuff. Ooh, nice shot. Any leads since we last spoke? Nope. I think my detective days might be numbered. What, you're giving up? It's not that I'm giving up, it's just- do you have any idea how many interior design agencies there are in the area first of all, it's like a needle in a haystack. And I don't even know if she's from around here. I mean, she could have been in town for business. I mean, she was in a rental car, remember? Woah. Where'd that come from? Beats the heck out of me. Well, you haven't been talking my ear off which is kinda freaking me out, so uh... what is your take on all of this? Well, you are staking out my place. Yes. Eyeing every woman who comes in there. That's pretty much true. And calling up strangers asking if they know obscure sci-fi movies. A book that's being turned into a movie. Honestly, I think it's great. Really? I haven't seen you this passionate about love since Cassie. And to be honest, you inspired me. Inspired you how, Zack? I haven't felt that zing, you know, that you feel for somebody? Yeah. In a long time. And because of you I'm going after it. It's just my little, you know, thing that's going on that's happening. Now watch this. This is gonna be a doozie. Oh, I'm watching. I'm always watching. The Mona Lisa of golf swings. I'm always disappointed. No, no, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. It was unnecessary. You're right. Two in a row. Yeah. Zack is back. Holy smokes. Zack is back. That's right. Who's the man? I'm the man. Alright, so these are all imported from the top ranking coffee countries in the world. This one is from Ethiopia, this one is from Kenya, and this one is from Colombia. And these are the different desserts that go with the coffee. Like a pairing, but with coffee and desserts instead of wine and cheese. Exactly. What do you think? I love it. This is going to blow our clients away. Alright, maybe wait until you taste it until you say that. I gotta go. Hey, uh, you know your friend, the one that was on the date when we met? Yeah. Is she still single? Yeah, why? Oh, I mean... my, my friend, he's still single and maybe we should like set them up. Nah, I think we need to put our snooping days behind us. Besides, I took a solemn vow to keep my nose out of her business. How about we focus on ourselves and go on our second date tonight? I'd like that. Ok. I'm gonna go... Eat your coffee. Ok. Yeah. Hi. You ready for the big pitch? Can't wait. Ok. So the vintage bird cage will go in the front window and these wood chairs are artisan-crafted so they'll bring a real rustic feel to the room as well as keeping that nostalgia of early century home living. The lines are clean, they're classic, and it's just timeless. So you really think this is the best look for our home? One hundred percent. Well, I love it. Really? Oh, that's great news! This is going to be so much fun. I can- I can start right away. Today? Yeah, I'll just get my tape measure from the car. That's great. Ok. Well I think it's all looking great. Hey, I never asked you. What do you think of the make-shift office? Yeah, it's kinda like- kinda like an office in a kitchen. Exactly. It's just temporary until we get the house renovations done. Right. Hey, I really appreciate you coming here on a Saturday. Yeah, no, of course. Big campaign. Yeah. Well, you know, I think the logo could be sharper, but apart from that we've done some good work. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Ok. Call it a day? I think so. If you've got time I know Susan would love to see you. Yeah, of course. I'll clean up after. We'll go say hi. Great. Love it. It's good to have you back, Jeff. Thanks, man. Honey, look who's here. Jeff. Hi, Susan. Oh, it's good to see you. It's so good to see you. I was so excited to hear you were coming back to the agency. I'm glad I'm back, I actually kinda missed this guy. Well, I would, too. Oh, stop it, you guys. I just hired the decorator. Uh oh. Oh, let's see, let's see. This is great. Mmmhmm. Really unique. I like it. How much? Shhh. ( Whispers ) Keep it a secret. You guys are the first ones to see the plans. So I've got the tape measure and we can start with sort of, I guess the kitchen... Oh, uh, Kelly Sands, this is Jeff Gates. Kelly's the decorator. She's fantastic, and affordable if you're ever looking to do anything. And Jeff is Larry's co-partner. Although if you need a tow, he recently had a little stint at Autocall. Honey. It's nice to meet- I forgot something, I'll... I'll... Uh... she- the- gotta go. Please wait. This is so confusing. I know. I know, just please give me one minute to explain everything. Who are you? I'm Jeff Gates. I- i- I'm the guy from the Autocall call. I'm the one who reads bad sci-fi and likes ferns and thinks that you are so hard on yourself but in this incredibly endearing way. But... your co-partner? Autocall was a temporary job. I just- I wanted to try something new. And I'm really glad that I did because I got to meet you. But what about that guy I went on a date with who said he was you? Wait, you- you went on a date with a guy named Jeff from Autocall? That's what he said. Can you describe him for me? Super inappropriate, cowboy boots. Cowboy boots? Ok. That would be my former co-worker Tom. So it's really you then. You're the one that rescued me. What about your ring? I- I wasn't quite ready to let go of the past, but um... I think that I am now. How about you?
