Maid Zhang! Yes, coming! Yes, young miss? Ask madam to come down. Tell her that the candles are lit. Oh no, what a disaster! Didn't I already tell you that it's madam's birthday today and to be extra careful not to break anything? Young miss, I don't know what happened. It just slipped out of my hand - That's enough. Just hurry and pick it up. But whatever you do, don't let madam find out! Yes. I cut my finger! What is it with you today? It's no big deal. Don't do that! There's some medicine in my room and gauze in the drawer. Put a bandage on it. Oh, hello, madam. What broke just now? Just now... it - It wasn't our house. Some child kicked a ball and broke a window in the alley. Children these days are like little thugs. I can't stand it. Daughter-in-law, if you have children of your own someday, you'd better not let them run wild like that. Mother-in-law, where's my sister-in-law? She's upstairs. Didn't she say she was going to take you to see a Shaoxing play for your birthday? Some friends wanted to come to play mahjong. I'll go another day. Say, what play is Yuan Xuefen appearing in these days? Let me look in the newspaper. Ah, I can't see clearly without my glasses. Mother-in-law, you don't need to read the ads. I know. Yuan is appearing in "Xianglin's Wife". "Xianglin's Wife"? Never heard of it. I hear it's a new play, a real weepie. A tragedy? The more tragic the better! I simply adore tragedies! Maid Zhang, what happened to your hand? My hand... Just a touch of rheumatism. I put some ointment on it and wrapped it up for her. Mother-in-law, let me kowtow my birthday respects to you. Hold on. I haven't even kowtowed myself. Perhaps if I kowtow sincerely enough twice, I'll have a grandson by next year. Who did this? Maid Zhang, was it you? Yes, it was me, madam. So, that sound of something breaking just now, was this? Yes. Daughter-in-law, you just told me it was a window in the alley. Maid Zhang, you've broken many things in the few days since you arrived here. Don't you realise these things cost money? Maid Zhang, be more careful in the future. You hear me? Daughter-in-law, you can't be so polite with stubborn wretches like her. Madam, you'd better hire someone else. I can't do all this stuff. What? One little comment, and you want to quit? In this house, I do everything. It's just me. Maids in other households work less hard, but get paid more. Maid Zhang, if you need more money, you should ask in the right way. Daughter-in-law, why should we raise her wages? We cover her board and lodging. Madam, are you saying that servants should pay for their board and lodging? Enough, enough! Drop this now! Come on, take out this broken bowl. Quit, if you're going to quit. You won't be missed! Fancy acting up today, of all days! Mother-in-law, don't let her ruin your day. I'll deal with her later. Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law! What is it? Come here. I need to talk to you. Coming. - Hey, sister-in-law. - Hello. - I want to ask your advice. - All right. Just now I paid my birthday respects to mother, and she gave me $50,000. I want to buy her something to eat. What should I get her? I don't know what she likes to eat. Oh, ma. Daughter-in-law, this was just sent by Zhiqin's godmother. I don't feel right accepting so much. Then just accept one gift, and send back the ham. Then, how much should I tip her? You can decide that yourself! I'm old and the price of everything is going up these days. If I get it wrong and give too little, she'll say bad things behind my back! These two boxes of oranges and apples probably weren't cheap. I'd say... give her about $20,000 would be about right. But I don't like either of these. My favourite is pineapple. - Oh, pineapple's your favourite? - Yes. Daughter-in-law, does Zhiyuan have business cards? Yes. They're in my room. I'll go and get them. What's this? You're going out? Yes. I'm going shopping. Maid Zhang, give this namecard to madam. Oh, Maid Zhang, come here. In the future, don't talk back to madam like that. I know you have a lot of work, but if you do it conscientiously - Young miss, I'm not just saying this. The price of everything is going up. But servants get paid less and less. Maid Zhang, from now on just take what madam pays you, and I'll give you a little extra every month. Take this. Here's $50,000. But whatever you do, don't let madam find out! Thank you, young miss. You're so understanding. Now go and apologise to her, right? - Got it. - Off you go. Hello? Younger brother, is that you? When did you get back? How could I not recognise your voice? It's hasn't even been two years since you went to Taiwan. Big sis, I missed your wedding and I haven't met your husband yet. How about I come to visit you now? Hang on. Today is her mother-in-law's birthday. You can wish her a happy birthday. What? That was ma talking to me. She says to wish your mother-in-law a happy birthday. I'll see you soon. Wait a minute. Did you come back by boat or by plane? Plane? Then you wouldn't have been able to bring much luggage, right? I was just thinking that since it's your first visit... How about this. Why don't you go to an import shop, and see if they have any Taiwan produce. You can say that you brought it back from Taiwan. Pineapple would be best. Pineapple? Right, got it. What? Oh. Ma, she wants to know if you're coming. I won't go. Ma says she's not coming. Huh? She's asking whether pa wants to come. Go and ask him yourself. Hello? Hold on a sec. Papa. Come here. Come here. Eh? Sister wants to know if you'll be going to the Tangs. - It's her mother-in-law's birthday. - Ah. No. You go. Hey, Sizhen, pa's not coming either. You wish her a happy birthday for us. All right. Goodbye. Ma, I'm off. Be careful what you say at their house. - Old Mrs Tang is very strict! - I know. Ma, you think I'm still a child, don't you? HUA NAN GROCERY COMPANY Do you have fresh pineapple? Yes, yes. Have you any bigger ones? We're almost sold out. This is all we have. They're hard to come by. In that case, I'll take the lot. All right. I'm here for pineapple too. I'm sorry, we're all sold out. Could you let me have a couple? Couldn't you just buy a couple fewer? I came here just for this. So did I. These are for a gift. If there aren't enough it won't look good. You're so unreasonable. I... I... I'm unreasonable? Why would I give you the stuff I've just bought? - Brother, you're here! - Sister! Mother-in-law, this is my younger brother. He's just back from Taiwan today. Many happy returns! Don't be so polite. Let me introduce you. This is Mrs Yang, and this is Mr Yang, a lawyer. Lawyer Yang is a good friend of my husband. Please, sit back down. This is a local product I brought back from Taiwan. Really! You can bring such a big thing on an aeroplane! What is it? Pineapple. I don't know whether you like to eat pineapple or not. What a coincidence, I love pineapple! If I had known, I'd have brought a few more. This is more than enough! Daughter-in-law, why don't you take your brother up to your room. You must have so much to catch up on. Mr Yang, I'm truly sorry, Zhiyuan is so careless. He invited you here to play mahjong but he himself isn't back yet. That's all right. We can wait. It doesn't matter. In that case, let's set up the mahjong table and take it from there. Sounds good. Mr Yang, Mrs Yang. Ma, I'm so frustrated. I went to many shops, but I couldn't find pineapple. Don't worry. Calm down. We have pineapple right here! Your sister-in-law's younger brother just brought these back from Taiwan. If I'd known, I wouldn't have had to and do all that running around. - He's upstairs talking with Sizhen. - Oh? - Why don't you go up and meet him? - All right. Sister, you've lost a lot of weight. Just look at how much better you look in that picture. Oh, is that right? I don't think so. Where is your husband working now? In a bank. Banking is the most uninteresting of all! He would really like to change job, and he's got all sorts of plans, but unfortunately he has no capital. Oh, sister-in-law, you're back. Let me introduce my younger brother. He just got back from Taiwan. What? You?! What's this? You two know each other? I ran into him just now buying pineapples. Sorry about that, just now. It doesn't matter. Daughter-in-law, fetch the mahjong set for me. All right, I'll get it. - Mr Chen, please have a seat. - No, no. You sit first, please. You must have had a tiring trip. Not at all. Flying isn't tiring. Just a short trip and you're there. Isn't flying quite dangerous these days? This time was really bad. We had almost reached Shanghai. There was thick fog everywhere. We kept circling many times, but were unable to land. The plane was almost out of fuel, and everyone was panicking. - O Lord Buddha! How frightening! - What happened next? Everyone onboard was weeping and wailing, quite out of control. Only I remained calm and wasn't scared at all. Getting scared is no use, is it? I thought that if we were to crash and my life ended in an instant, wouldn't that be a heroic way to go? You're so brave! You're so great! Gosh! I've been so wrapped up in your story, that I completely forgot about the guests downstairs. Daughter-in-law, if Zhiyuan doesn't get back soon, you fill in for him. All right. Sister, when did you learn to play mahjong? Just after I got married. I know that Sizhen doesn't really like to play, but when we have visitors she has to play to keep them company. It's part of a wife's bitter duty. She always used to love listening to music. - Do you still? - How could I? What I'd really like is a wireless to hear some music every now and then. Young miss, the madam asks you all to come downstairs for noodles. Let's go down. How could your husband not be home yet? I have no idea where he is. Young master, the master will be coming down soon. Thank you. - Father-in-law. - Yes. What are you doing here? I know it's your mother's birthday, but I have things to do, so I can't go. Don't give it another thought. Sirui is back from Taiwan, so I sent him over to pay his respects. Oh, he's back already? Yes, just back today. I made a special trip here today to discuss with you a very important plan. A plan? You're always coming up with some new plan. Aren't you doing just fine at the bank? I spend every day counting dollar bills at the bank, but at the end of the day it's all someone else's money. There's no future in it. Future? Zhiyuan, I don't mean to have a go at you, but if a young man doesn't do his job well, and talks this kind of nonsense, what future does he have? My advice to you is to keep your place and do your duty. Don't get carried away with these daydreams. Hello? Chen residence. What's that? - You want to talk to the master? - Ask who it is! Hello? What's your name? It's a Mr Lin. Lin, is it? He must be trying to borrow money again. Tell him I'm not home! Hello - the master went out. Yes, yes. Goodbye. Zhiyuan, I won't keep you. Today is your mother's birthday, and you must have many guests at home. Go back and entertain them. Hmm? But... but I came here today especially to see you. No matter what, I hope that you'll give my plan some consideration I want to start my own company. You own company? We'll do import-export business. It'll be very secure. Is it possible that you might consider helping me? Helping you? How can you ask for help if you want to run your own business? You must do it by yourself. A man does what he can based on his own abilities. So you want to start your own business? Fine! But just ask yourself... do you have gold bars? Do you have US dollars? Master, Mr Zhu is here. Ah, Old Yun! You're such a busy man, thanks for making the time. Come in and have a seat. - Today it's really hot outside. - Boiling! - I stopped by your place just now. - Oh? - Yes. - What did you want? I've got too much cash on hand at the moment, and thought perhaps you could use it. I thought I'd lend you some. Currency's depreciating now. I have the same problem. It's hard to lend just at the moment. That's as may be, but you've got to help me out. Surely you can use a bit extra. Father-in-law, I'm leaving. Young miss, the young master is home. Why are you back so late? The guests have all left. You're completely drunk. Where were you drinking? Do you hear me? Who were you drinking with? By myself. By yourself?! That's right. I went to see your father. Not only did he refuse to help me, but he even went out of his way to scold me. He asked me how many gold bars and US dollars I had. But if I had gold bars and US dollars, why would I need his help? That's just how he is. We'll think of something. What solution? Don't worry, I've got something in mind. Don't think that he'll listen to you just because you're his daughter. He has no family feeling. He only cares about money. Hey, hey, enough of that. Sizhen, pass me my cigarettes. Hey, what happened to your head? When I was drinking just now, I bumped into something. Does it hurt? Don't touch it. I'll put some antiseptic on it. Sizhen, you're the only person in this world who's good to me. What are you talking about! Hey, my younger brother is back from Taiwan. I know. He and Zhiqin talked for a long time. They really seem to like each other. - Oh no, I'm against it. - Against it?! If your father looks down on us poor people, why should we aspire to marry up? I can't talk to you. You're so grumpy today. Relations are useless. Only friends are any good. Only friends are any good? But some friend you are! You invited Mr and Mrs Yang to play mahjong and then disappeared! Goodness! I completely forgot. I'll apologise to him tomorrow. Office of Yang Naijun - Hello, Old Yang. - Hello. Hey, Old Zhou! What are you doing here? Old Tang, it's been a long time. - I'm really sorry about yesterday. - Where on earth did you go yesterday? We played eight rounds and you still didn't return. Ach, don't bring it up. Old Zhou, how have you been? Not bad, not bad. Old Zhou's struck it rich. He's always flying back and forth between Shanghai and Hong Kong. It seems that among us old classmates, I'm the only one who hasn't made good. Old Tang why don't you come with me on a trip to Hong Kong? Who knows maybe you'll find some opportunity there? It's his treat. I'd love to go and have some fun myself, but I'm really busy with work here and can't get away. Just say the word, and we'll go. There's a flight this afternoon. But... I... Old Tang, can't you request some leave from the bank? Getting leave is no problem, but... Don't overthink it. Go home and pack your bags. I'll be waiting for you at the airport in an hour. All right. Sizhen! Sizhen! I'm downstairs. Sizhen, I'm getting on a plane immediately for Hong Kong. Hong Kong! Why? A friend has invited me to go with him. There might be an opportunity to do some business. Go pack for me, will you? Ma, I'm going to go to Hong Kong. Hong Kong? How will you go? By air or by ship? By ship. By ship, by ship. Ship is safer. Planes are too dangerous. What is the name of the ship? It's called... - Sea Breeze. - Sea Breeze. Sea Breeze. Sea Breeze? When does it set sail? Soon. Sizhen, go upstairs and pack my bags for me, the simpler the better. In a moment, I'll see you onto... the boat. Good. Call a taxi for me. Zhiyuan, you've never been far from home before. You take care, now. I know. Ma, brother. Zhiyuan, you probably haven't met yet. This is Sizhen's younger brother. Oh, brother-in-law, I came by yesterday, but you weren't home. Where did you two go? We went swimming. He taught me! Your brother is going to Hong Kong today. Oh? By ship or by plane? By ship. By boat? What a trial. Slow and uncomfortable. Master Chen, one shouldn't trifle with one's life. Life and death are in the hands of fate. Going by ship can be risky too, can't it? Well, it's still safer than going by air. No more flying in aeroplanes for you! All right. I've called a cab. Great. Let's go and wait by the front door. Ma, I'm off. Brother-in-law, I'll see you onto the boat. No need. Goodbye. Goodbye. Zhiyuan, when you arrive in Hong Kong, send a telegram. I will. I really don't like seeing your brother being so familiar with my sister. There you go, meddling in other people's business again! Zhiyuan, take a look at this. This is that brooch I keep talking about. Look how well it's set! When I have the money I'll buy it for you. Then again, this type of thing isn't that useful. If you had the money, it'd be better to buy a wireless. That wireless is always on your mind! Hey, the cab's here. Sizhen, you can go home now. Zhiyuan, if you don't find any opportunities in Hong Kong, don't be disappointed. Just have a good time. I will. Old Tang - come on! Goodbye, Mrs Tang! Hello? Yes? Younger brother, is that you? You want to talk to Zhiqin? Hold on a sec. Sister-in-law! Telephone for you! She's just coming. Hey, what are you doing calling her so early in the morning? Hello? Yes, it's me. What's that? Wait a moment. He's asking me to go to your parents' place, then for a picnic. Why not come with us? But he didn't invite me. Hello? I'll only come if sister-in-law comes. Hmm? Hold on. Hello? Hey, sister. She's being shy. She won't come unless you do. Be a good big sister, and do this favour for me. No need to put it like that. I'll come. We can't let my mother know. Your parents didn't come on her birthday, so she's a bit put out. So you go first, and I'll join you later. Then she won't be suspicious. Fine, but make sure you come. I said I would, so I will. Ma, I'm going out for a bit. Where are you going so early? To a classmate's house. Have some congee before you go. No, thanks. I'm not hungry. Sister-in-law, where are you off to? A classmate's house. Bye! Bye! Mother-in-law. Zhiqin is getting more and more unrestrained. Every day she's going out early and not coming home till late. Students are supposed to have fun during the summer holiday. I'm really anxious with Zhiyuan off travelling. He's grown up. What's there to worry about? I didn't sleep at all well last night. Disaster at sea: SEA BREEZE SINKS! Ship strikes a reef and sinks on its journey to Hong Kong. Several hundred passengers drown. Daughter-in-law, what was the name of that ship Zhiyuan took? Sea Breeze. Sea Breeze!? That's right. I checked the other day when I saw him onto the ship. There were so many people travelling to Hong Kong. The ship was packed! Travelling is such a pain these days. Hey, mother-in-law! What is it? Mother-in-law. What's wrong? Just... look... Ma, no. He didn't take this ship. Don't lie to me. Which ship would he have taken if not this one? He didn't go by ship. He flew. Wha...? Now you're telling me he flew?! I didn't want to worry you, so I told a fib and said he was going by ship. Actually, I saw him onto the plane myself. You're treating me like a little child! Do you think I'm so easily fooled? Oh, heavens! My son! Why would I lie to you? He really wasn't on that ship. But didn't you just say you saw yourself how chaotic it was onboard? It's because it was overcrowded that it sank! My heart is breaking! Maid Zhang! Maid Zhang! Young miss. Mother-in-law, go and rest upstairs. Maid Zhang, help her upstairs. Oh... Is this the Tang residence? Telegram. Mother-in-law, Zhiyuan has arrived in Hong Kong. Here's a telegram from him. I'll read it to you. "Safely arrived in Hong Kong. Will return in three days." You must believe me now. Who knows what tricks you all might be playing. This telegram couldn't be fake! Zhiyuan might be safe and sound after all, but you almost killed this old lady just now. Mother-in-law, don't be angry. I won't lie anymore. Anyway, you have all played this old lady for a fool enough already. Mother-in-law, I want to go out shopping. If you want something to eat, I'll bring it back for you. You go ahead. I don't have any appetite. My sister is still not here. Let's not keep waiting. Come on! That's no good. We insisted that she come, so we can't go without her now. I was just worried that you were tired of waiting. It's all right. Do you have any novels? No. The books my father reads are all ones we're not interested in. Who is this? This is an old photo of my father. "Master of Orchid-Lover Studio." Why does it say that? Because he once loved a woman named Orchid. She died later. Father never got over her, so he came up with this name. Oh, who'd have thought he'd have such a moving background? Don't be deceived by how my father looks today. He used to be quite the dashing, passionate young man! Sister-in-law, why are you so late? I meant to come earlier, but your mother wasn't feeling well. - What?! What's the matter with her? - Don't be alarmed. She's fine now. Come on, let's go. It's getting late. You two go. I'm exhausted. I really don't want to go. Then why did you come? I came to tell you I won't be going. - Right, so we'll be off, then. - Off you go. Hey, brother, is dad home? He's upstairs. Something important? Not really. See you later. Bye. Papa, you're coming down. Where's Sirui? They've just gone out. Then why haven't you gone out with them? Ah, I have to go back to the Tangs' soon. Old Madame Tang is not feeling well. Eh? What's the matter with her? Her old complaint, indigestion. Daddy, my mother-in-law is quite an odd one. As soon as she began feeling ill, she started saying she was about to die. She got so anxious that she gave me the key to their safe. She told me that in the safe there are 180 gold bars. - A hundred and eighty! - And US dollars! US dollars! And stocks! Stocks! Coal or textiles? I'm not sure about that. I never knew until today that their family was so rich! Papa, just think how tight-fisted that old lady is. She won't give away a single penny. Zhiyuan doesn't make much at the bank, and I can't tell you how much I've suffered, trying to keep house all by myself. What are you crying for? Do you still have that safe key on you? Oh, she took it back? Well, never mind. All these assets will eventually pass to Zhiyuan. Child, you have better days ahead! Daddy, you make everything sound so nice. But how can we get by without any money? Zhiyuan can't stand it, so he went to Hong Kong to try to find an opportunity. What's he doing in Hong Kong?! He has come up with a plan. Plan? What plan? Hasn't he told you? No. I think he wants to start some type of business enterprise. Then why didn't you send him to me? Tell him to come right back. If he needs some capital, your papa can help him. Daddy! Would you really be willing to help him? It'll all be for you in the end! After all, that boy Zhiyuan is mature beyond his years. He's bursting with, uh... um... that's it... prospects! Yes - prospects! When will he be back? He's only in Hong Kong for three days. Then he'll be back. As soon as he gets off the aeroplane, you tell him to come to me! Sizhen, let me introduce you. This is Mrs Tang. This is Miss Ma. Thank you, Mr Zhou! See you, see you! Goodbye! When you went to Hong Kong there were just two of you. Why are there now three of you coming back? Old Zhou made a packet, so he brought back a woman, As soon as men get rich, they start fooling around with women. I really look down on that. But then, I'll never be rich! Don't lose hope. By the way, I forgot to tell you: my father told me that he considered your plan. He thinks it's a good one. He said as soon as you're back you should go to see him. What? So now he's willing to help me? He even praised you. He said that you have ambition and are sure to succeed. Give me your suitcase, and go straight there to see him. Rickshaw! Rickshaw! Look, that brooch is still there. If I do get rich, I'll buy it for you. Don't be silly. Off you go. Ah, Zhiyuan, you're back! I came as soon as I got off the plane. Here Zhiyuan, that plan you told me last time makes a lot of sense to me. Come on, let's talk it over. Didn't you say that it was too risky? You've misunderstood me. Last time I was testing you, to see if you'd give up. But you didn't give up. You went to Hong Kong to look for opportunities. That shows you have ambition. If you'd be willing to help me, that would be fantastic. "Help you"! You're my son-in-law! Of course I take an interest in your affairs. Here, let's work out how much capital is needed, how many employees, and how much in start-up costs. Prosperity Enterprises Corporation Planning Office Prosperity Enterprises Corporation Prosperity Enterprises Corporation Operations Department Deputy Manager General Manager Sizhen! Zhiyuan, you called me? Come, look! I bought you that wireless. Ah, you really bought it! I know what you're like. If I'd given you the money you'd have saved it. So I bought it for you myself. It's wonderful, but such a top model! If it's worth buying, buy the best! Young master, a guest has arrived. Wait while I see who it is. Hey, I tell you. I have something even better for you in a bit. Old Tang, I'm here to invite you out to tea. No, thanks. Not today. I came specially to ask you. You've got to come! Come on. Go, go, go, go, go. Oh, Linlin, hello. What took you two so long? He didn't want to come! Mr Tang, don't play the saint now. I'm setting you up with someone. Isn't that good? Setting me up? Don't be ridiculous! Where is she? She went to make a phone call. She'll be back in a moment. Ah, the weather's been so hot these few days. I'd bet it's you who's all hot on the inside. Stop joking. Ooh, who's that using my fan? Old Tang, let me introduce you: this is the famous Miss Shi Mimi. Oh, my apologies. Please have a seat. Mimi, did you get through? I'm so annoyed. Tickets are all sold out at the Grand. The new film at the Majestic is good too. Old Zhou and I saw it yesterday, So you've seen it already. It'd be no fun going to see it on my own. Hey, Old Tang, why don't you go with her? Me? I never go to the cinema. Then again, if Miss Shi is so keen to go, of course I should accompany her. Mimi, this is quite an honour for you! Old Zhou, the store will be closed if we don't go over there now. Linlin wants me to go shopping with her. Then you go ahead. Wow, I only introduced you five minutes ago, and you're already sick of us! There she goes again! All right. We get the message. We're off. Bye-bye! It's still a little early to go see a film, isn't it. Mm-hm. We can stay here for a little while. One coffee. Miss Shi, do you often watch films? I love watching films, but I'm also terrified of watching them. Why? Because whenever I watch a tragedy it reminds me of my own life. Oh? Mr Tang, my life's been so full of misfortune that if it were made into a film, you couldn't help weeping. I never imagined. So young, but you've suffered so many misfortunes. You... You must think that I'm a soulless woman. No, no, no, no. You're great. Do you think you could tell me some of your story? All right, but you'll have to promise not to tell anyone else. Of course. You have to keep my secret, because... I've never told this to anybody. You're back! What was it you said earlier you wanted to give me? I was going to give you that brooch. But unfortunately, someone had already bought it. Such a shame. When I wanted to buy it I didn't have the money. Now that I have the money to buy it, it's gone. It's infuriating. Sizhen, bring me my cigarettes. I've heard that that the film at the Majestic is great. Could you take me sometime when you have the time? But you know I don't like watching films, don't you? Can't you take me just this once? - Go with my sister. - She's already seen it. Then... just go by yourself. Mimi, sit over there, all right? It'll look bad if anyone sees you sitting here. But I like sitting here. Then I have absolutely no dignity. What do you mean, dignity? Brother-in-law. Brother, are you going home soon? We'd like to go with you. I have to go somewhere else in a minute, Then take the wireless back in your car. It'll be more convenient. It's already fixed? Yes. I picked it up for my sister. Good, good. Brother, we'll head home, then. This is the latest model. Mine is out of date. If you like this type, I'll buy another one for you. Buy another one for me? You talk like you're afraid I'll steal this one. I'm not after your family's things. Then... just take this one. Having it at your place is just like having it at my home. You're just saying this to fool me. Now I know that you don't really care about me. Hey, Mimi, don't leave. Mimi! Mimi! Old Tang. Hey, Old Yang, Old Yang. I have something to discuss with you. All right, all right. I have a friend who wants my help with an import shipment. I want to know what your procedures are. I'll have my deputy manager explain it to you. Please call in Deputy Manager Xue. I've been swamped recently. I've had to hand over quite a bit to my deputy manager. Busy, huh? Maybe. But I'm here to settle accounts with you. How could you take a mistress and not tell your old pal? Mistress! It's nothing as serious as you're making it out to be. Old Tang, don't just take it from me. You have such a beautiful wife at home. Why would you go looking for another? People are incorrigible like that. No matter how pretty a wife, she'll never be as good as a mistress! This is Mr Yang. - This is Deputy Manager Xue. - Mr Yang. I'll leave you two to it. I have something to deal with. - I'll be off now. - Yes, yes, yes. When you're done, fetch that form out of the safe for me. - Yes, yes, yes. - Here's the key. See you tomorrow, Yang. Please have a seat, Mr Yang. I have a friend who wants to place an order through your company. No problem. Whatever your instructions, Mr Yang, we're at your disposal. Miss, Mr Tang is here. Mimi. I didn't think you'd be here so soon. Look, I brought you that wireless. Who wants it?! Who's this? It's, uh, my brother. He just arrived by train from the countryside. He was exhausted, so I let him take a nap. Brother, this is Mr Tang. Oh... that's Mr Tang? Please, have a seat. Thank you, no. I have to go out for something. Sister, what time is it? What's the time? Ten to five. Mr Tang, that's a fine watch. Where did you buy it? My father bought it and gave it to me. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Mimi, are you still angry? Just look. After you left, I couldn't do any work. I hurried straight over. You're really incorrigible! If I hadn't got angry with you, you wouldn't have come. So you're saying you wanted me to come, then? So don't go home tonight. Oh, no. I do have to go home tonight. But I'll spend more time with you in the daytime. Isn't that the same? Forget it! You might as well go home and be with your wife. If you're so afraid of her why did you take up with me? Mimi, Mimi! I'm not afraid of her. I just don't want any trouble. So you are afraid of her! Otherwise why not just tell her about us? Is that necessary? I don't want to keep sneaking around like this. I want to get married and be your legal wife. Divorce her! Mimi, why are you putting me in an awkward position? Aren't things good now? She's not in the least suspicious. Not in the least suspicious? In that case, your wife really is clueless! Sizhen, why haven't you gone to bed yet? I'm not tired. Well, I'm exhausted. I played sixteen rounds of mahjong with Old Zhou and his lot. Zhiyuan. Just remember to come home early tomorrow. My father wants to have us to dinner. Any special occasion? Nothing important. He just hired a new cook he's extremely pleased with, and he wants us to put his dishes to the test. All right. Hand me my cigarettes. Here. Young master, will you be taking a bath? Maid Zhang, wait a minute. Zhiyuan, your clothes. Hand me the dirty ones. Young miss, is this handkerchief yours? Oh, yes, it's mine. I'll wash it myself. Master! Master! Father! It's getting late. Shall we serve dinner? Let's wait a while longer. Why on earth isn't Zhiyuan back yet? Sizhen, did you tell him to come? Yes, I did. He's just really busy at his company, so he might be a bit late. He really works too hard. Yes, he's so busy that he's been losing weight. Sister-in-law, I can't hold it in any longer. I have to tell you. My brother is having an affair. Sizhen, is this true? Impossible. Impossible! Sister-in-law, where did you hear this? Your brother is an honest person. I can't vouch for anything else, but I know he would never do such a thing. You really are naive! I saw it with my own eyes. What? You saw with your own eyes? That's absurd! I saw it too! The other day we went to brother-in-law's office, and saw some vamp there cozying up to him. Indeed! He dares to mistreat my daughter, like this! Intolerable! Sizhen, how could you be so naive? How could you have no idea that he's been fooling around with another woman? What's come over you? Ma, I've known for a long time. But I thought that if I didn't confront him, it wouldn't get worse, but if I did, everything would burst out in the open, and then there'd be no going back. I thought that if I pretended I didn't know, maybe he'd gradually come around by himself. You really think a man will come around by himself? Ridiculous! When your father had a kept woman, I had to go over there and make a fuss in order to get rid of that woman. If I hadn't, he still might not have come around even now! That... You're crazy! How could you still be thinking about that? You know Sizhen well enough. She's too timid to stand up for herself. We need to do it for her. Yes. You go over there and fetch Zhiyuan back. If he sees you, he'll be a bit afraid. If he's not afraid of me, who is he afraid of?! But we don't know where that woman lives. Ask the driver. He's sure to know. Right, I'll go there immediately. I'll give him a damn good scolding! Linlin... With Old Zhou away from Shanghai these two days, you must be feeling lonely. Forget him! We've finished. Finished? Think about it: this time when he gets back from Hong Kong, he's sure to bring another woman with him. So why don't you introduce Linlin to a new friend? Who are you looking for? Tang Zhiyuan. This isn't the Tang residence. Just what are you doing? Who do you think you are? I'm Zhiyuan's father-in-law. Who the hell are you?? Zhiyuan! F... F... Father-in-law! So, this is your little love nest? What do you mean, "love nest"? This is my home! You get the hell out! - Zhiyuan, get back home with me! - How dare you grab him! If his wife can't deal with him, her father should just mind his own business! Mimi, don't be like that. Don't get angry. If a gentleman like you has something to say, he should sit and talk it over. Isn't it just as good to talk sitting down? Zhiyuan, you should still listen to me. Go home. You'll see that this old man is right. "Old man"! Look at you, trying to impress us. You don't look all that old! How old would you say I am? I'd say... no more than forty. Don't joke. I was forty twenty years ago! You can't fool me! Anyway, I've always preferred older men. Young men these days are simply not reliable! If mother-in-law knew about this, she'd be sure to scold me. She wouldn't dare to interfere in my affairs! The thing I most dislike is a jealous wife! Does Sizhen know you came here? Sizhen? I should make a call to put her mind at rest. Hello! Hello? Sizhen? Sizhen! I've found Zhiyuan. I gave him a good scolding, I said: "You're being completely ridiculous, to let some woman instantly bewitch you." He admits he's totally in the wrong. You listen now while I chide him. Zhiyuan! Yes. No more of this ridiculous behaviour, you hear me? Daddy, that's enough. Zhiyuan is a decent man, but he's got a stubborn temper, and he won't be able to stand it if you scold him too harshly. If you're willing to forgive him, that's great. I'll send him home in a minute to apologise to you. Go home and sweet-talk her. That'll be the end of it. If you want to go out and have fun, you should know how to fob off your wife with the right words. You don't even know that! Sizhen, Sizhen! Don't be angry. I'm really apologising to you. I've taken your father's scolding to heart. I promise you that I'll never see that woman again, If you don't go, won't she come looking for you? She won't. We made everything clear while your father was there. I've given her the apartment and the furniture, but from now on I'm making a clean break from her. A clean break? Zhiyuan, I feel like a change has come over you recently. I haven't changed! Hello? Yes. Oh, please wait a moment. It's a Mr Wang, He's already called for you quite a number of times, Mr Wang? Oh, it must be Wang Jinzheng. He's probably calling to borrow money again. Tell him I'm not home. Hello? Mr Tang hasn't returned home yet. Don't be a flirt! Don't be a flirt! You're quite a naughty thing. Don't be a flirt! Don't be a flirt! You're quite a naughty thing. You look even younger in a western suit! I haven't worn a suit in years. It feels so awkward! Mimi! Zhiyuan isn't here. We're not here for Zhiyuan; we're here for you. - Me?! - Yes. He wants to take us out dancing. Mimi, I just learned the conga. You know, the one that goes chicka-chicka-bump! What? Haven't you heard? There's trouble at Zhiyuan's company. Trouble at Zhiyuan's company? Trouble at Zhiyuan's company! What trouble? There, see for yourself. "Prosperity Enterprises Co. unexpectedly bankrupt. "Deputy Manager embezzles massive sum and absconds. "Creditors suing for restitution." This is outrageous! That's all my money! What is Zhiyuan going to use to pay me back? That Tang Zhiyuan is finished. Now he's in debt to lots of people. Zhiyuan's been acting absolutely ridiculously. That's what's brought on this disaster. That's why I say that young men aren't reliable. - Go to hell! I'm off to find Zhiyuan. - Don't go! Go to hell! Linlin, let him go. The sight of anyone from that family makes me ill. - Where is your Young Master? - He hasn't returned home yet. - And the young miss? - She went out shopping. How about the old madam? Mr Chen! How are you? I'm all right. But my dear lady, you should know that Zhiyuan's company has had a disaster! I know! Zhiyuan is in a state! Where is he? I went to find him at the office. He wasn't there! He must have gone to the lawyer's office. That boy Zhiyuan really messed things up. He completely neglected his company and spent all his time fooling around with a mistress. Mistress! What? You didn't know? Their little love nest isn't far from here. Oh? Have you been there? Have... Have I been there? Of course I have! I went to set him straight. I told him to stop fooling around. But even still, disaster struck! Mr Chen, even if Zhiyuan did have a mistress, you couldn't blame him. It's your daughter's fault she hasn't got pregnant. Fine, fine, fine. My dear lady, everything you say is absolutely right. But let's set this aside for now. My purpose in coming was to settle accounts with Zhiyuan. Settle accounts? Let's sit down to discuss it. I lent Zhiyuan money to start his business. But the company is bankrupt, so I want him to pay me back. Zhiyuan is your son-in-law. When he's facing difficulties, you should support him, not bully your son-in-law! Son-in-law? Some son-in-law! I didn't lend him money because he's my son-in-law, or anything like that. I lent him money because of you, my dear in-law. Because of me? Did I ever ask to borrow money from you? Of course not! You've got plenty of gold bars. Why would you borrow money from me? Gold bars? Since when do I have gold bars? Don't give me that poor act. You'd only need to cash in a couple to pay off Zhiyuan's debts. My dear in-law, I have no idea what you're talking about. Do I really have to spell it out for you? That day... you were ill... your son had gone to Hong Kong... You thought you were going to die. So you gave the key to your safe to your daughter-in-law. And told her that you have 180 gold bars. My daughter told me all about it. Have you gone crazy, wishing I were dead? How on earth could I have 180 gold bars?? You don't? Could Sizhen have lied to me? That's right. Your daughter is certainly capable of that. All she does all day long is lie and lie! Yes, she's my daughter. But since she married your son, she's one of your family now. Now she's on your side, trying to cheat my money. This family of yours... you're all liars. You've got some nerve saying that! Just ask yourself how did you end up raising such an unprincipled daughter! My daughter's unprincipled? How about your daughter? You just tell her to stop seducing my son with her womanly wiles, Nonsense! Your son's the one who's been chasing her. Smooth-talking, smarmy-faced good for nothing! Honestly! Daddy! Sizhen, tell me: why did you lie to me? You said that the old madam had 180 gold bars? I... Daughter-in-law, I have a question too. Why did you lie to this old dotard, and tell him that I was about to die? Sizhen, you just tell your younger brother, I forbid him to see your young sister-in-law, that shameless hussy. Come here! I tell you, your beloved brother is not welcome here anymore. If he comes, I'll throw him out! I'm the one who's actually suffered misfortune here. What's the use in discussing anything with you women? I'm off to find Zhiyuan. I must ask you: why do you want me dead? I don't have the energy to get into this with you now. Go upstairs and tell Zhiqin to come down. I have to speak to her. Mother-in-law, you... Go! Tell her to come down. Sister-in-law, what's wrong? I heard mother and Old Mr Chen arguing just now. Ma was furious, and said that we can't see each other anymore! Don't cry! Sister-in-law, you're the only one who can help us. Don't worry, I'll help you. Your mother wants you downstairs. Whatever she says, just grin and bear it for now. We'll work out something eventually. Go to her. You're back! Did you run into Mr Yang? I'm talking to you. What's wrong? What's wrong? Mother told me that your father was here just now. - Yes. - Yes! Was it you who told your father that my family was hoarding gold bars, and pretending to be poor? Not exactly. I only told him that story about the gold bars so that he'd lend you money. No wonder! Suddenly the old man was willing to lend me money after all. I never expected that. Know what else? This is all on you. If he'd never given me that damn loan, this disaster would never have happened. Now my company's bankrupt. Isn't this all your doing? You and your family... the father is a bully, and the daughter a liar. I'm going to divorce you! Yes, I did lie... but I was lying to help you! I never imagined you could ever say something like that! If you want a divorce, then let's divorce! Crying now? What have you got to cry about? Young master, Lawyer Yang is here. Sorry, Old Tang, I wasn't at home just now. It's a mess. Our Deputy Manager's run off. I know all about it. Have you informed the police? No. I want your advice on what we should do about it first. First thing is to report the crime to the police. Let's go. All right. Brother-in-law! Mr Yang! Mr Yang, where is your office? I might have something to see you about. Maid Zhang, is Zhiqin upstairs? Call her down, will you? Zhiqin, there's something I've been meaning to say to you. I can't keep it in any longer. Zhiqin, I want you to be my partner for life. Zhiqin, will you agree to marry me? Zhiqin... You should leave quickly. My mother is upstairs. If she finds you here, she'll throw you out I just want to say one thing. Then I'll leave. Did you know that your father and my mother had a fight? That's exactly why I'm here. Since they're all against it, I think... we'll have to go behind their backs. After all, we're both of legal age. Let's marry in secret and get a lawyer to make it official. Marry in secret? That's... That's not the best way, is it? My only worry is that it's not fair to you. Not fair to me? Don't worry about that. Then, you accept?! I... Big sister! You two are talking. I won't interrupt. Sister-in-law! Don't go. We have something to discuss with you. You help us decide something. What? Just now, he said to me... that he wants to... You tell her! - You tell her! - No, you tell her! - I told her that I want - - Maid Zhang. Maid Zhang! She's coming downstairs. You'd better hide. She shouldn't find you here. Yes. Go now. We'll have plenty of time to talk things over. All right. I'm so frustrated! What did he say to you just now? He... He said... Maid Zhang! There was someone here just now. Who was it? No one. I was just chatting with Zhiqin. Daughter-in-law since when do you smoke? I have a touch of indigestion. I heard that smoking would help. Maid Zhang! Maid Zhang! Ma'am? I've been calling for ages. What have you been doing? Young Master Chen was just here. I was making something in the kitchen. Master Chen?! Yes. Why did he leave so soon? Zhiqin! Was he here for you? He... No. It was I who asked him here. I'm sure you did ask him here. It must have been to meet Zhiqin. No, no, mother! They just happened to bump into each other. Maybe they did just happen to bump into each other. But a visit from a relation should be open and direct. Why on earth are you sneaking around behind my back? Does that dear brother of yours really think I have 180 gold bars, and he can cheat them from me as a dowry? What a family! Not just after my money, but they want to take my daughter too! Ma, that's really going too far! You little fool! You've been duped and you don't even know it. Sister-in-law, go upstairs and get some rest. Here, take this and wash it. Oh, Maid Zhang... from now on, please be more frugal on the daily necessities. Soap is expensive. So don't waste it. If I use less soap, don't blame me when the clothes aren't clean. I was only telling you not to be wasteful. I bought a box of soap last month. Now there are just two bars left. Where's it all gone? Is Madam suggesting that I stole it? I mean someone might have stolen it. I never said it was you. Well, if not me, who could it have been? Maid Zhang! Don't speak to the madam like that! She's accused me of stealing. I won't stand for it. I quit! Well, good riddance! This one has no conscience. No sooner are we poor than she quits. I told you a long time ago that I'd quit. If the young miss hadn't treated me so well, paying a little extra every month, I'd have left long ago. What?! The young miss has been paying you extra? Maid Zhang, don't speak nonsense! Go on. Daughter-in-law, is this true? How much have you been giving her every month? I've just given her a tip now and again, not a regular amount every month. I see. You're acting behind my back on everything. I've been scrimping and saving to give my son a little extra, and now you're using my son's money to make yourself look good. God damn it! How dare he treat you like that? Abandoning you all of a sudden? Have I become a cuckold for nothing? Don't make it sound so bad! Well, we can't let him off so easy! He should learn not to mess with us! But he's broke! What can we do if he doesn't have the money? He'll have to find it somehow. We can't let him off the hook! What exactly is this debt he owes you? Call him downstairs and I'll speak to him face to face. He's really not home. If you have something to say, you can say it to me. That'll do too. Please, sit. What brings you here? Zhiyuan's wife sent me. His wife? Yes, his wife, Shi Mimi! I'm her elder brother. You said Shi Mimi? Didn't Mr Tang break up with her a while back? Break up with her? Is that what he told you? It's not that simple. My little sister's pregnant. Pregnant? If he doesn't contribute some money, we'll sue him for being an absent father. Money? How much do the pair of you want? Two hundred million at the very least. Fine. I'll make sure Mr Tang gets the message. Not so fast. I'm not leaving here without the money. Don't be so unreasonable. You know his company just collapsed. He doesn't have any spare cash. He can't find it just like that. In that case, tell him to come to my sister's place tomorrow. - I'll speak to him in person. - I'll be sure to tell him. If he doesn't show up tomorrow, you just tell him to watch his back! He's gone? You heard everything? Didn't you tell me you'd already broken up with her? I do mean to break up with her now. Now? You're deciding this now? So everything you said before was a lie? Before... Her brother told me that she's pregnant! You must know that. That's a complete lie. How do you know it's a lie? I saw her just two days ago. Why wouldn't she have said anything? Oh! You were with her two days ago. You... You... Sizhen, what's the use in crying now? He wants you there tomorrow. How do you plan to deal with him? I... I'm not going. You don't have to go. Just pay him two hundred million. Two hundred million! How could I come up with that much? We'd better think of a way to deal with him. Oh, you get yourself into a fix, and you want my help to get you out of it. There's just no way I can go there tomorrow. If you don't, he'll come looking for you here. Then... Then, could you go there tomorrow instead of me? Me? You're the only person who can solve this type of problem. Sizhen, if you get me out of this fix now, I'll do anything you ask me to do in the future. All right. I have an idea. I'll go tomorrow. But I don't know if it'll really help you in the end. In the end? What do you mean, "in the end"? In the future, I'll need your help with lots of things! I'm not sure I'll ever have the opportunity to help you again. Everybody wants to move up Everybody wants to make dough But if you're asking for a visit from the God of Wealth It's going to take more than a kowtow Hello? Oh, wait a moment. Mini, telephone! Hello? Yes, it's me. Oh, hello, Linlin. Mimi, I have a new friend to introduce to you. Hey, he's absolutely loaded! Are you free today? Today I can't! Little Tang is coming over in a moment. Yeah, I need to wrap things up with him. Fine, tomorrow then! See you tomorrow! Linlin has a new friend to introduce me to. That's right. You do need a new line. I'm not sure I can keep on with this tough life with you like this. Look at you! You've got it made, but you still get annoyed with me! All right, all right. Save your breath for other idiots. It doesn't fool me. So, it's you. Where's Little Tang? Too afraid to come himself? He... What? He's afraid I'm going to eat him? Oh, this must be Miss Shi! Hey, hey, hey. Did you bring the money? I want to talk with Miss Shi. Miss Shi, I've wanted to meet you for so long, but never had the chance. Today - Miss Shi, you're pregnant now. And our lady of the house has always wanted a grandson. She's worried about you being out on your own, so she asked me to come to bring you back with me. Me, go to your house? That's right. You didn't bring the money, and now you want to take her away instead? We won't mistreat her. Miss Shi, although Zhiyuan had this setback, at our house there's always something to eat, even if you don't like it. What? Me go to your house, and everyone look down on me? - What kind of fool do you think I am? - Miss Shi. Miss Shi... Get out! I'm in no mood to continue this pointless talk with you. The car is waiting downstairs. Just grab some clothes for the road and we'll be off. What nonsense is this! Then... then I'll help you pack. Wow, you have so many pretty outfits! Gosh, what a beautiful coat! Zhiyuan hasn't wanted to buy a coat like this for me. At your wedding I'll borrow this to wear so that I can look my best! This woman never shuts up. What a pain! Don't you touch my things! Such a childish temper. No wonder Zhiyuan likes you! Such... romantic naïveté! Romantic naïveté?! You're the one who's got a screw loose. Forget it, let's go! Get off! Why on earth would I want to suffer at your place? You're right. It's more comfortable over here. It would be better for us to move over here. You move over here? That's right. We could sell the house. And living here would save on expenses. Ah, so your entire family would be taking up residence here! There's plenty of room. We could put a cot here for the old lady. Our maid could sleep on the floor. Zhiyuan, Zhiyuan... we could let Zhiyuan sleep on the sofa. You and I could sleep together on the bed. Since you're pregnant, you'll need someone to look after you at night. Pregnant! Pregnant! You're so annoying! Who said I'm pregnant? What? You're not pregnant? Enough, enough. I can't stand it anymore. Get the hell out of here, with all your great ideas. You're only her elder brother! She's married into our family. So she's a Tang now! What are you talking about? "Tang family!" She belongs to me! You! That's right. She's my wife! Get the hell out! So, I've cleared this all up for you. They're unlikely to come looking for you in the future. And in the future we won't have any more misunderstandings. Everything will be just like before. Matters of the heart aren't that simple. We'll never the be same as we were before. What? You still haven't forgiven me? Whether I forgive you or not is not the problem. So... what do you want me to do, then? Didn't you agree that if I cleared this up for you, you'd do whatever I want? Of course. Tell me. Just tell me what you want me to do. I... I want a divorce! Divorce! Eh... divorce? Don't joke! I'm serious! You really want to divorce? I admit I failed. I'm not a born liar. I only tried to do my best, but who knew... the more I tried, the worse things got. At this point, I'm just exhausted. From now on, I won't tell any more lies. And from now on, I don't want to be your wife anymore either. So in that case... is there no way to save it? I'll sleep at my parents' tonight. Tomorrow afternoon I'll see you at Lawyer Yang's office. We'll file for an amicable divorce, and that'll be that. You've really thought it through. I've been thinking it over for several days now. I didn't come to this decision suddenly. But having come to a decision, I won't change my mind. Fine. If you insist on this, I won't stand in your way. I need to return all the keys of this house to you. Here. You? Why are you back here? I've come to ask a small favour. What is it? I was hoping that... you could return that brooch to me. Give it back?! I didn't ask for a penny from you. And now you're here asking me for things. That brooch isn't worth much. But I had originally planned to give it to my wife. Now she wants to divorce me, and I feel I owe it to her. I want to give it to her, no matter what. How disgustingly sentimental! I don't have the energy to waste words with you. In that case, I have money. I'll buy it from you. How about that? You want to buy it from me? How much will you pay for it? I... Here... This is all I have. What you think a brooch like this is worth that little? Forget it! I really don't have any more. Just take it. You! Go and find a beggar to give it to. Well, whatever you say, you're giving me that brooch. And if I don't, what are you going to do? If you don't give it to me... I'll take by force! You're crazy! You thief! You... What are you doing? You've scratched my face! Consider yourself lucky I'm not reporting you to the police. Now get the hell out! Get out! Get out! No, I won't! You! What are you doing here? - I... - Anyway, you're too late! We're legal age, so you can't interfere. Yes. We're married now, so if you want to interfere, you're too late. I've known for a while. I came here to congratulate you! Sister-in-law, you're too good to us! - Hey, Old Tang! - Eh? Brother-in-law is here too? He's here to congratulate you too. You really scared me. I thought mother had sent you to force me to go home. Don't be silly! Your brother has always been on your side. Brother-in-law, thank you, thank you! It's getting late. We have a train to catch. They're going to Hangzhou for their honeymoon. Off you go, then. Don't miss your train. Yes, we'll be going then. Lawyer Yang, thank you. Brother-in-law, goodbye. Sister, we're off. What's this? They came here in secret to get married? You didn't know? Didn't you both say you'd come here to congratulate them? Hey, they forgot something! Why did you say we were here to congratulate them? I don't oppose their getting married, but I don't approve of their eloping like this. I know. I lied again. But it's the last time, and I did it for you. For me? If you didn't approve, it wouldn't stop them. And you'd damage your relationship with your sister. Besides, today should be the happiest day of their lives. I didn't want to ruin it by letting them know we'd come here to get divorced. You're here to get divorced? Old Yang, it's a long story. This is all very strange. It's all her idea. Mrs Tang, I suggest you think this over again carefully. I don't mean to offend you, but in my experience, in divorce it's usually the woman who suffers the most. I've already had my share of suffering. I'm not afraid of suffering from divorce. Lawyer Yang, I'll trouble you to prepare the divorce papers. We'll sign them immediately. In that case, will this be an amicable divorce? You both agree to it? Of course. No. I don't agree. What? I've given it some thought, and I don't want to get divorced. Looks to me like you two should go home and talk it over. Mr Yang, there's no need. My mind's made up to divorce him. Zhiyuan, what's come over you? Having regrets now? Be rational. Don't come to the lawyer's office just to make a fool of yourself. Fine. I have nothing else to say. Old Yang, do as she says. Mr Yang, kindly prepare the documents for us. Sizhen, do you remember... there was a brooch that you really liked, but when I went to buy it, it had been sold? I just saw an identical one at a different shop, so I bought it for you. I know... it's already too late. But you should take it anyway. That way I won't feel so bad. You went to her place to get it back, didn't you? N.....No, I bought it at a store. Hey, what happened to your forehead? I got drunk and carelessly bumped into something. Nonsense. You couldn't do that just by bumping into something. Just to get this brooch back, you got your face all scratched up. Don't touch it! Mr Yang, do you have any antiseptic? - Antiseptic? Do we have any? - Yes. Sit down. You're such a fool. Why risk your neck for such a silly brooch? What if she had hurt your eyes? That woman is really vindictive. Sizhen, you're the only person in the world who's good to me. In the future, you'll have to take better care of yourself. "In the future"? What kind of future do I have? What do you mean by that kind of talk? Without you, I really don't want to go on. I really hate myself. I've lost all self-respect. Don't cry. It's time to sign. Sizhen, I've thought things through. By staying together with you, I'll only do you wrong. So we'd be better off apart. Here. No. I won't divorce. - What? I insist on divorcing her! - I refuse to divorce him! Sizhen, what's come over you? Having regrets now? Be rational. Old Tang, just make a sincere apology. Wouldn't that be the end of it? No, no, no. I insist on a divorce. All right, all right. That's enough of this foolishness. Even if you two do decide to divorce, I won't certify it for you. Look at her... crying one moment, laughing the next. Let's not make fools of ourselves at the lawyer's office, all right? Old Tang, I can't tell you how often we lawyers see people in this kind of situation. Today, we should be celebrating! I'll take you two out, how about it? - No, no, no. It should be I who treats. - Of course it should be you who treats! How about we go to Fragrant Hills Café? Why Fragrant Hills Café? It's so expensive! You see, she's trying to save you money again! You're so frugal! Sizhen, Fragrant Hills Café is the place I first started to go astray. Now, I want to turn over a new leaf. So I want to start from there. We can discuss it at the restaurant. Let's get going. It's still too early. Hey, where's your watch? My... My watch... Old Tang, here's a toast to you! Yes, yes, yes. It's still early. Why are you in such a hurry? Miss Shi, do you often watch films? I love watching films, but I'm also terrified of watching them. Why? Because whenever I watch a tragedy it reminds me of my own life. It's been so full of misfortune that if it were made into a film, you couldn't help weeping. Then, do you think you could tell me some of your story? All right, but you'll have to promise not to tell anyone else. You have to keep my secret, because... I've never told this to anybody!
