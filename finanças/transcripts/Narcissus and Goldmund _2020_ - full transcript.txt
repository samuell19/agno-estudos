CHURCH CHOIR Narcissus, my dear boy... Did someone complain about my arrogant behaviour... gracious father? That might be true... I ask you to punish me. Narcissus, your behaviour is outstanding Sometimes I wish you be more misbehaving CHUCKLING Nevertheless, you know for many people it's scary if someone is far too bright It is nothing... I felt I often see you lonely, young brother, I'm worrying about you. Just in loneliness I can study and be completely with god. Because I want to become a monk or a priest CHUCKLING For that, you have to know the people I observe And what have you observed about me? That... that... you might prefer... to care goats in a hermitage, simple and humble, instead of reigning over a big monastery. Right? Venerable father! Come! Quick! (Whore) (Bastard) (You are exactly like your mother. Don't look at me, damn!) The boy becomes a priest. I will pay if you affiliate him. This should not be the problem. So, if this young soul wants to seek the St. Benedikt... I want him to expiate! For the disgrace which his mother made us. WHISPERING: I can't look at him anymore. Take the gold and do with him whatever you want He is exactly like her. Like this dirty... this vanished... CHUCKLING Can we? Come! Tell this priest... that your mother was a WHORE! HA! I said that... TELL HIM THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS A DAMN WHORE! Narcissus! Take care of him! But... but... I have to... I want it like this! (COME HERE) (Let me go!) Collective prayers are like this: At 2am the Matutin with a Dederum Then we pray at dawn the Prim at 6am, afterwards are lessons. At 9am the Terz with hymns and psalms. The Sext at 12am. What if someone doesn't wake up in time? Did you once miss it? No! Of course I always woke up in time. 3 hourse is later the Non, in the church, with hymns and palms. At dusk we pray the... How long does it take to become a monk? - After years of preparation, if you are... - I have to become soon a monk so I can pray for my mother. Because god hates her. No God loves everyone of us. Even my mother? At dusk we pray the Komplet. Afterwards is bed time. What is your name? - I am Narcissus. - And I am Goldmund. CHURCH CHOIR (Tell the priest that your mother was a WHORE!) WHISPERING (Goldmund) (GOLDMUND) So, this helps against the fever. Then he gets a tea. With berberis and gentian. Then he will be better. Can you stay here and take care of your friend? - He is not my friend. - Please! Stop that! Take care! Hey Narcissus! Do you have a best friend? Here in the monastery... All of our love must belong to God! The three of us could be friends together. You, me and God. CHILDREN SHOUTING (You want more you little shithead?) Stop it! Go away! Ah! Are you crazy? He slapped Narcissus, this dirty dog! Don't dare it! Gu... be... bibis... LATIN If you don't speak latin, you can't understand the word of God so you are a donkey! And donkeys get the stick. (Please don't) SOBBING Venerable father, I think abbot Daniel called you. What? I didn't hear it. It seems that he needs your help. Your wisdom, profoundness and intellect. Sapienzia, profunditas, taritas. Ok, then . Narcissus, take care. LATIN PRAYER - Hey Narcissus. - What? You want to come? I show you my secret spot. I shouldn't do this. They will see us and we get into trouble So what? Come! I knew that it was wrong. Wow, you are more brave than I thought. Don't you miss it as well to be outside? I... I can think better here. Maybe I'll stay here forever. Really? Then I stay as well. 7 years later Goldmund? Goldmund! Anyway... LATIN Goldmund It is SO easy! It is an ACI: an "accusativ cum infinitivum" - Yes sure. An "accusativ cum individuum" - No: "infinitivum" No! No! CURCH BELLS LATIN PRAYER SNORING WHISPERING: She has nice breasts. Are you crazy? It's the holy mother of God. - So what? Why God shouldn't... - Ssh! Wouldn't God have given her the most beautiful breasts if his son Jesus Christus should drink from them. What? I am serious. - You think I'm an Idiot. - No! But you won't be a scholar with ideas like this. Be happy Goldmund. You will have a happier life because you can feel deeply - Big joy... big pain... - Narcissus! Brother. LATIN PRAYER CHOIR Go away, idiot! - Goldmund, you want to join? - We have a plan, Goldilein. This evening, after the Komplet. When everybody is sleeping, a little surprise. - Women! Do you join? - Yes! I will join. I ask Narcissus if he also wants to join Narcissus and women? You are joking! Do you even go to the toilet together? Ah! Bring drawing stuff. LAUGHTER ANIMAL NOISE BABY SCREAMING WHISTLING He will just draw. I just draw. MOANING Watch boys! Something like this you can't see at the monastery right? LAUGHTER You. Will you come again? What? No drawings? I have it in my mind. I will draw it later. I told you that he is too stupid. Tomorrow. I promise. Do you have it? Goldmund is like a bird in the cage. He wants to be a monk, but his talents are different. He has to explore the world. - He is still young and... - Narcissus. You know as well that he won't be happy here. By the way, there is talking, mean talking. Goldmund is a pretty boy and you and he... Venerable father... I... - I swear at the Virgin Maria... - With the thoughts Narcissus, he listens to you. Just you can help him to find his path. For his and your best, you have to send him away. Gracious abbot! - I... I can't... - Yes. Love Love demands sacrifices. But... This... is without soul,... without truth. This is below your dignity. I can see neither the wonder of the birth... nor passion, nor love. What would you know about passion and love? It is not you to judge that. Whatever you have seen out there, it doesn't belong here! Maybe even I don't belong here anymore! Yes, maybe you really don't belong here anymore! Hey! What is your name? A little bit of wine? Glodmund No thanks. The priests didn't allow it? You don't look like a real monk. More like a real man. Oh, a long life, full of love. And here... a secret. A dark secret. My mother! Tell me more. You search the women. The mother, the eternal womb. Will I ever find the mother? You will find so much, my beauty. Are you sure? Are you sure? It's a decision for the whole life, Narcissus. You shouldn't become monk because of pain... neither to run away of something. Poverty, obedience, abstinence... The whole life? It's my destiny. Always. GASPING My beauty. And now I'll show you... where heaven really is. Until my vow I want to stay in the cave of penance to be not distracted by... by secular things. Secular. Goldmund is secular. Shut your mouth, Lothar. Do you already have enough, my golden boy? Why? Can I stay with you? I can work hard and I can... You are a lovely boy. I love you. We can be together and I will take care of you. Nein. I need a lot. But a man I don't need. The talisman. I know it. My mother! From where do you have it? Dou you like it? A woman gave it to me in Fürstenberg when I told her here future. My mother! WHISPERING Narcissus! What are you doing? My time has come. But you can't just... I have to talk with you! I think I know where is my mother. Then you have to go now. But you don't want me to stay at all? With you? Goodbye. Ha. Go. No! No! CHOIR 15 years later My dear abbot. What a honor. LAUGHTER Excuse the disturbance, my lord. An invader. Without trousers and without brain. Where have you found him? In the west wing. In the wardrobe of... your wife. With my wife, the princess? Please. Even we can't do nothing. Nothing at all. It's not allowed. But if you order it. Just a couple of minutes. For the holy sacrament of the confession. The Almighty will thank you. SOBBING Quick. With this nobody will dare to stop you. And now... beat me! Are you crazy? It has to be authentic. I can't do this. Let's rest here. Goldmund! Anselm! Benjamin! Quick! We tricked them quite well, right? Benjamin, bring a blanket. Quick! LATIN PRAYER We will bring you back to the monastery, Goldmund. The monastery... I've thought of you so many times. What happened? Too much for one life. Goldmund, Goldmund, wait! Aaaah! Reading! Writing! German! And Latin! Reading, a half and writing 3 coins. You can get the war taxes back from your lord. At the latest at All Saints' Day with a written request Writing a request... You just want my 3 coins. But I still get my half coin for reading. Cheaters get nothing from me. No! I could send the guards, you... you thief! So you can write? Without ink? I could write with the finger in the air. Do you want to work for me? One warm meal per day, a bed, and one ducat. Per month. I'm on the way to Fürstenberg. Over the mountains? That's not possible anymore before winter. An entire ducat? You just saved me lots of money. BARKING This is our new writer. Give him some clothes. And a room. Upstairs next to the servant. He should wash! He smells like a fitch. Come. WHISPERING CHUCKLING Hey! There he is. What was your name again? Goldmund. Gracious lord. You will help me to write my chronicle. Crusade. My battles with the heathen. All of it has to be written. And... Lessons for the children. Yes! Please, please father. We would learn something of the young teacher. LATIN "who was loved by us, like nobody was loved." Wrong Lydia! "Will be loved" That is future. WHISPERING: Was loved, will be loved. It's the same. "Amamitur" is future passive and not past. Lydia, Catull's poems are still too difficult for you. Translate the Gallic wars. - But I... - In silence! So! Enough studied, girls. Go! Amamitur. Future passive. Don't become to clever. Otherwise we won't find a man for you. And then... I killed a heathen. And then... I killed another one. In the end arrived two more. These I also killed. Maybe not just "killed"? What? Maybe... to slit, to strike down, to massacre? Yes. Very good. To massacre... poetic! This... I still could do it. Like with the heathens. (Teacher!) To massacre. (Teacher!) Father said I can't go out alone. You want to accompany me? Lydia! It won't last long, your little happiness. Rather leave fast, before my father is going to hang you! Lydia! Are you injured? Is something broken? My heart is broken! You don't love me? Outside at the elm, somebody was already been hanged. The crows picked in his pretty dead eyes. And his stiff body was spinning in the wind. Don't you see that I'm forever yours? You are just pretending! In order to get the possibility to touch me. My face... my lips... to steal a kiss from me... Are you not ashamed at all? What did this guy wrong? Hm... You are just allowed to kiss your own bride. Don't you know that? Your groom is going to laugh if you don't even know how to kiss. So teach me! Close your eyes. Lydia? Lydia! That's your punishment, teacher! Lydia! Goldmund? Goldmund! - Oh my gold heart! - Lydia. I'm so sorry! My love is deep. And true. I didn't want to let you freeze in the snow. Maybe I can compensate for it? My Goldmund! If I just could belong totally to you... Let us flee. As long as we love each other, nothing will be lacking. I would go with you Goldmund. Julia. I hate you. If I can't stay here, I'll tell father. Then you will also hang from the elm. - Go away, stupid cow. - But he shall kiss me as well. - She is playing with you... - I would go with you... You're just a kid you don't know what you're talking about. Goldmund? I have a new idea. Yes please? To send somebody to kingdom come. What do you think? Mhm. You have... inflamed an poetic fire in me. Ah. Lydia. Julia. No! Wait! Please don't! Please don't! I received you... like a son. I entrusted you with my daughters. If you had been someone else I would have killed you. Like in the old days. With my own hands! - You have to believe me... - Shut up! Go! If you ever return I will beat you dead. As God helps me! Lydia! I knew it. Together we flee! You still didn't understand? Sweet Goldmund. It was just fun. I could never love someone from your rank. You didn't know this? Good bye. No. - Lay him in the bed! Lay him in the bed! - Let me go! Both of them! - In the bed! - Let me go! Lay him in the bed. Do you want to let me moulder? Brothers! Narcissus. I need fresh air. So let him go. But then the stitches will burst. I don't care if he gets gangrene. Wait, wait. It's... it's ok. It's ok! Everything is fine. And I have to go along soon. You have more important things to do than feeding a tramp. Everything is the same like back then. Yes, less has changed. You are abbot. And like every abbot I care that not many things change here. And you? Which profession have you learned? A sculptor taught me. That wood is well stored. My master would have like it. We need a new shed for the pigs and... the St. Catherine. Goldmund. Could manufacture a new one for us? The old one has worms and her arm is dropping. You could also recuperate a little bit more and don't have to leave yet. And a small altar. Don't has to be a masterpiece. The brothers will like it either way. I would be afraid that you don't like it. Goldmund? Brother Lothar. LATIN Do you remember... I can remember well the stick. Who holds his stick back, hates his son. But who lovs him... teaches him with castigation. You sure have loved me a lot. Do you know what Lothar? Goldmund became a sculptor and will build us a new St. Catherine. What? But the pig's shed, gracious... I changed my mind. So you became a sculptor. And did you find your mother in Fürstenberg? (Out of my way!) (Hey! Rutha!) (Mother!) My mother! I was so stupid. How should I find her? Here in this huge city? And the memory is more and more fuzzy. Soon I will forget completely her look. God will guide you. 10 Ave Marias. Master Niklaus? Straight... (Let's work!) What are you doing here? - Get off! - I'm searching Master Niklaus. Dele! Give the boy something to drink and make him go. Master Niklaus! I saw your Maria in the cathedrale. I must learn from you how to give soul to a piece of wood. - That is blasphemy! - Shut up Alfred. You don't know nothing about this. Continue. What did you see? I'm searching my mother. She is in my head, but I... I just remember a feeling. If I could create a picture of this the exterior form would arrive by itself. He is a fool! He wants to cut a feeling. Draw. Your mother or... whatever you produce. Who is he, father? - I'm not sure. - And you take him as trainee? The others just want to be liked. But he, he is at least fighting with his demons. - A maniac? - If I got luck! The body is too long. - And she is not even on the ground. - Because she is hovering. I paint her like she is in my mind. Not like she really looked like. - Are you making fun of us? - It's ok. You sleep in the atelier, keep everything clean and help the men. In 4 weeks we will see. (And remember what I always tell you.) (You have to love the wood.) (YOU HAVE TO LOVE THE WOOD.) (Like his girl.) (LIKE HIS GIRL.) When you are sitting there during I chop the wood. Then I would gladly chop the whole day. Hello! What is very important. The creation has to be finished previously in your mind. The creation has to be already finished previously in your mind. Master! I beg for this piece of wood. I want to try something by my own. What have you learnt from me after 2 years? Except of sweeping and catching slaps? How the cutting knives become your best friends. That you have to finish the creation already in your mind. And that you have to love your wood like your girl. And now you want to make art. Yes. How many pieces of art did I create, what do you think? Real pieces of art? Surely, several dozens. Three. The rest, all this stuff serves, is liked and it is well sold. I earn a lot of money, sure. You can blame me, that I just want the best for my daughter, that I bought the expensive medicine for my wife when she was dying, that I let fix the roof when it is raining inside. If I had sacrificed everything to the art, I would have become the greatest sculptor of my time. Or equally mediocre. But poor and mediocre. Get out. So take the wood. Do something with it. - You won't get a second. - Thanks Master. - That will be a... - Yes it will be. So, do you show me your sculpture? - What do you mean? - Don't pretend. The holy sculpture at which you work every night. They say that you are good. That you have a great future. You have good hands. Big and strong and even full of feelings. Ssh. Hopefully you won't disappoint my father. The hot soup arrives. Goldmund? What is happening? He is finished. Is this a friend? Is he well made? You have cut it well. I also like him, your friend. It's like he has a heart inside. And blood. And tears. You are a beautiful person, Goldmund. In the inside and outside. (I am still Prior.) Gracious abbot. The artists declines the entrance. The altar is not finished yet. Four trunks for an altar for Catherine. Ok. But he wants 8 further trunks. - And he hired again another assistant. - So what? Should the colours mix by themselves? - How many assistants do you have? - Two. - Three, four, five. - Oh, the others are helpers and trainees. It is an altar. This, that... It is cut into pieces. Like our world. But, in the center Maria. She is holding things together. So the unique fractions are becoming a gloriole. And here the nine holy women. - Nine! - Yes! Yes! Nine holy are better than one. And the mother of god. A fractured altar. - I never saw something like this. - Not yet. Neither did I. Yes, we do need a new shed for the pigs. Rain gets inside and the backwall is moulding. But we are servants of god and no herdsmen of pigs. Rather suffering from hunger and cold and honour the holy virgin. Goldmund is going to create a magnificent altar, for the honour of god. And who is guaranteeing that this Goldmund has the ability to create this masterpiece? I guarantee this. Go on! Let's go. Alfred. What do you think? The hands... are slightly to big. Yes, the hands are slightly to big. But I feel something. Johannes was the favourite disciple of Jesus. And I can just feel, how this trunk is grieving about a friend. He is suffering. Because he loves him. And I I am suffering with him. Goldmund. Did you find already your mother in your head? No. But I learned from you how to search. I am thankful for this. The search I have to do by my own. Yes. Goldmund, tonight you will have dinner with us in the house. Goldmund. Aah, there you are finally. Look. Lisbeth cooked all of this. She is an excellent homekeeper. You can't find a more diligent and deftier in the whole region. - Goldmund. Is your hand better? - Here, try this. So you can cut more of these nice sculptures. So, we are going to produce docens of your sculptures of Johannes. In three different sizes. The people of Flandern love this stuff. - And? Do you like it? - Goldmund. You know that I'm not a man of many words but I talked with the people of the guild. - And they make an exception. - You are going to marry me! Father will give you the status of associate and heir. And! You will get the Master's license. Then I will have more time again to make wood with a soul. You understand? So I think I don't have to tell you that never ever graduated someone so fast from trainee to Master. Your luck is complete! - It tastes good? - Yes! You became a Master. Wonderful. What happened to your wife Lisbeth? I refused of course. The wrong life... The wrong girl... Who do you think you are? You lived for two years in my house. Two years! Goldmund. My darling. We received you like a family. You pig! Who do you think you are? Get out of my house! And never come back! I didn't need the Master's license. Everything! Everything, but not to be rich and losing my freedom. I didn't experience enough at all to be an artist. Psst. Goldmund. Come. You don't need this. You have all your wisdom in your head, and in your books. And I have to experience all of that by my own. I have to suffer and get beaten to understand. An artist lives intensively. You are allowed to experience and to love. Yes? And what did I get from my intensive life? - No, no, no. No race. - What? - I am abbot. - Are you afraid of competing with a cripple? - It's not anymore like back then. - Let's go. My trust in you is endless, gracious abbot. Besides it is about him. He gets away with everything. All his foolnesses are allowed. He enjoys all of your attention and love. Goldmund is an artist. Artist. Back then infatuation between boys. But now you are abbot. If just the smallest suspicion comes... Comes what? You would be chased out of your duty. Or more. How dare you, Lothar? I would have got three coins from the Master. Lene. Believe me. They call it the black death. (But it's still three coins.) And where do we go? Somewhere where it's beautiful. If we are there, we will know it. Just like this? When I met you I knew that you are the right. Just like this. Goldmund. Here. I go hunting. We collect mushrooms and herbs. And at the border to the forest I found wild millet. We bake bread out of it. And what are we going to do during the winter? The cold. The hunger? Oh Lene... Now you spoiled it. We will solve it somehow. Lene. What is going on? I'm pregnant. I will have such a big belly and... and everyday you will have to work for the three of us. Soon you will have enough and run away with another Lene. No. That is wonderful. We are going to be happy. Father, mother, child. I will... Will you love me? Forever? Will you remain to be my lovely Lene? Married, in eternity, Amen. You need cloths. For a new bed. And herbs. I go downstream to the big farm to change things. I love you, Ms. Goldmund. I love you too, Mr. Lene. Hallo. Hallo? (Hallo?) Goldmund? Water, please. Water. No! No! No! (Lene.) Common barberry and gentian are good against fever. If it is a boy he should be called Narcissus. Do you agree? I know that it is a strange name. But Goldmund is strange as well. Narcissus. I need you right now. I need you and your god right now. Please. Please. Regarding this, what do your books say? Why God wants to punish us so heavily? You always said that the earth is divine. The creator is perfect. But the creation is not. We are not complete. You are a church's man. You don't know what it means to suffer. To loose a loved person. You are talking of the justification of god. I... I am talking of my dead Lene. From our dead child which had to die before it was born. (CRYING.) (MOANING.) - Wait! Take me with you. - Where? Anywhere but here. (LAUGHTER) (Goldmund) (Mother) (Mother) (Goldmund) (Mother) (Goldmund) (Goldmund) (Come) (LAUGHTER) (MOANING) Such a lovely bird came to me. So young and vital. I just want to watch and caress you a little bit. There you go, my bird. And another one if you let me feel it. - What do you do? - If you let me feel it. I don't want your money. Let me go! Away! No! You despise me! Just tell me! If I don't die because of the pest I die because of my age. I know. I know. I could be your mother. The amulet. My amulet? You want to have it? Come. Take it. Take it. Suddenly I am so weak. (Oh, my heart.) (I am so tired.) You are a lovely boy. Lovely boy. The amulet. Levi. The goldsmith from the ghetto. He manufactured it. You are a lovely boy. I'm searching Levi. The goldsmith. Levi. They killed him. And his wife, his children... Like they killed my family. Maybe the Jews are responsible for the pest. Let's beat them to death. Maybe it helps. That is how you think. That is a horrible injustice. Everybody is crazy. Because of fear and pain. He sold hundreds over the years. To every kind of women. Do you want to come with me? You helped me to bury my deaths. But still... I can't stand watching at you Christs. A jew. No. The face of a woman who is suffering. Who hates. Who is mourning but still forgives. The face of a saint. It is not about the real person. It... It is about the image in my soul. And she? Maria? How should I create her if I don't know my mother. If I don't know where I am from. Or who I am. All this years I tried to understand the world. The life. I wanted to try everything and experience with my own body. Pain, fear of death, inebriation, ecstasy. Everytime more extreme, until in the end I didn't feel anything. I have been in every corner of the world. I experienced a lot of good and a lot of bad things. I saw death and horror but also love and great beauty. And I saw that from this fool's game and dance of death... of the humans, something remained and persisted. The artworks. The overcoming of transcience. Do you like it? It is rare that another person expresses what you experienced and felt by yourself. Who is the artist? Nobody knows it. The pictures are a present from an unknown master. It is so vital. Are you from this profession? So I... I was an apprentice at Master Niklas in Fürstenberg. Ah, so you are a sculptor. In order to be called like this, you should have created something. And? I'm still looking for the big answers. So you have to tell exactly this with your art. That it is about the search. The unknown master. I know him and I would like to present you. Tomorrow at 12am a maidservant is going to come for you. At the fountain of the palace. See you tomorrow Goldmund! How do you know my name? Who are you? (Psst.) (Psst.) (A nice man.) Teacher. Julia. The pictures are... wonderful. Why are you hiding? The woman is not able to do artistic expressions. Didn't you know this? Not as good as I imagined it always back then. But almost. You should have gone with my back then. Sure, to the end of the world? And my virginity you would have got additionally. But not because of love, but of stupidity. But isn't that the beautiful of love? That you are allowd to be stupid. You can think like this if you are young. But young and stupid is no good plan for the entire life. Maybe you just can't find her. Maybe your mother is in all the women that you have met. The coquettish Lydia. Lisbeth, the perfect house women. The loved Lene who carried your child. And all the others. The many, many others. That is your search. What happened to Lydia? The pest. She survived but... She would have married the prince. But he didn't like her anymore and demanded me in her place. And? I gave birth to 2 sons. So my duty is done. Lydia never forgave me. She became bitter. Goldmund? I have a big request for you. Without clothing. The head a little bit higher. Keep your butt tense. - But that is not... - You are moving while talking. That is not good. This picture will last longer than you. It if for eternity. So try your best. (LAUGHTER) Quick! There is an invador in the chamber of the princess. Quick! Hopefully nothing happened to her! Are you done? Soon. Pants. I get wine and bread. You stay. Go, go, go, go! What is he doing there? Say your name! Whores, jews, and adulteresses will decorate the altar. My brothers, why isn't he showing something to us? If there shouln't be something to hide. (Yes.) I don't even want to say how much the cutting of Goldmund costs us. Which good things we could have done instead. But. Blasphemy! An insult to the Saint Virgin. (Yes!) No! The work of the devil. All these emotions in the faces. True faith you find in still suffering. Even more about women. This altar is completely blasphemic. Didn't you see how instantly the souls of our brothers were touched? Yes I saw their faces. But it was horniness and no piety! The woman is a sin. God created her to challenge us! Narcissus, let me destroy this devil's work... and let me chase the blasphemic Goldmund away! You are out of your mind. Brother Lohar, you will go to the hermitage at the Teufelsjoch. Stay there for years. Then we will see if you are ready again to stay in our community. Doom will come over you. Over you and over this whoremonger. Let him talk. He is just a cold person who is craving for love. The alter. This magnificent work. It is the result of your life. Yes. But it is you who made it possible for me. You struggled everything by your own. In contrast I... I hided my entire life behind my books. Doesn't it afford more courage to go out and to make mistakes? And to pay for them. Instead of living well cared in a monastery living a perfect life. From the perspective of the monastery my life was more correct. But for god. Have you seen how the brothers went on their knees? When you started the choral. Narcissus. This here is your destiny. Your life. But it was poor in love. I missed the most important. (MUMBLING) There are more and more. Many arrive from far away. It is hard for you to be happy. How could I be happy if I can't finish it. Maybe every pilgrim is recognising their own mother of God in her. I don't see her. You have to go where it is the most uncomfortable for you. Back in the past, when you lost her. Go home Goldmund. Back to your father. - Kai. - Goldmund. My half brother. The one from the whore. Just the devil knows if you are a child at all. - Is he still alive? - More dead than alive. He lays in his own excrements and I have to do the work. Father. You. Like your mother. So beautiful. But actually so sinful and bad. Cursed is she. And you. Where did she go? Back then. I have to know it. Beautiful. Mine. Why did she left me, father? Always had her own mind. She was like this. Didn't want to obey. What kind of man am I if the wife doesn't obey? She laughed, laughed. I took the rod. She escaped from your beatings. You damn beater. Run away. Do you understand? She wanted to run away! Wanted. She deserved it. She wanted? I couln't handle it anymore. She deserved it. You killed her. The whore had to obey her man. Come, come, come! Strike! Send me into the hell! You slained your father? Your own father? He was suffering horrible pain. Why should I redeem him from God's punishment? She didn't leave me. Are you not happy for me? I don't know if I can stand to loose you again. What yre you talking about? Our altar wil be finished and I... And you will leave this place where the time is passing by... and where all the love can just belong to God. - Back then you sent me away. - I had to! Because... Because I loved you more than myself. I just could be your friend. But I could never... love you. No. (CHORAL) (LATIN PRAYER) Fire! Fire! It is burning! - Let me go! - No! I have to go to Goldmund! You are our abbot. You stay here and do your duty. Benjamin. Build a chain. Build a chain! Get more buckets. Water! (LATIN PRAYER) (Goldmund.) We need more water. Dominik. Get buckets. Brothers. Hurry up. Faster. You have to forgive me. I wanted to see you happy. You... enriched my life so much. You don't even know how much. Where is your mother? You have to look for her. Meine Mutter? Your heart. How do you want to die if you don't have a mother? Without mother you can't love. Without mother you can't die. Narcissus. Promise me to be happy. Stay! Stay with me until it is over. Can't you sleep? What is going on? Are you crying? No, no! You are crazy. Sometimes I cry when I'm thinking of my mother. What are you doing? If you need someone who comforts you or loves you. Because he is stuck to me. I want to rescue him. And I want to protect him Because he knows my name. Can I also say something to God? Dear God. Please help that Narcissus and I are friends forever. She drawed him so affectionately. Like a lover the loved. That is Goldmund right? He would have like it. Dear Goldmund. The root of every art is death and transience. On this picture you will remain forever young, vital and desirable. Even if you are old and crooked. So young and desirable like the painting of a dead Christ. So I changed the plan and send you this sketch. Stay forever young and beautiful in your heart. Loved Goldmund. Julia. (CHOIR) Promise me that you will be happy. Narcissus and Goldmund
