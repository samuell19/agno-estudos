This Wacken Open Air, the largest metal festival in the world. Each year more than 60,000 people to Germany for their favorite bands. And whether you are for death, power, black, goth or viking metal is, if you are a metalfan, this is the ultimate place. I am Sam Dunn, I am one of those metal fans. From my twelfth I continually metal. My parents hoped that something temporary, but that was not. I graduated as an anthropologist, and decided when a documentary to the culture around heavy metal. It took me back to the workers' origin of England and America. Since I did see what Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and even Blue Cheer ... uncover the origin for a untold number of subgenres. On countless musicians and I said ... childhood heroes for me metal and everything around it. Satan. I also spoke hundreds of metal fans what metal means to them. From my twelfth was a metal part in my life. I found that the underground part is greater than I thought. For metal fans, it is more than music. It is an identity. After the movie came out ... I received many emails thanking the appreciation for the scene. What surprised me was the number countries from which the mail came. Many came from countries where I do not know that there was metal. I knew there metal next America and Europe existed. One of my favorites is Sepultura from Brazil. I have metal albums who live in Japan are included. But some e-mails to me to thinking. For years, the anthropologists impact of verwereldlijking investigated. But I've never been on the role of heavy metal on this thought. Now metal across the world distributed, which means that ... fans in countries with completely different political and cultural backgrounds. There is clearly more metal Saturday I totally do not know. In Germany, I will not find answers. So my anthropology study further; how metal is worldwide. My first stop in Brazil, the largest Latin American country. Also a place where many people to beach, football and samba think. But metal fans, it is also known to the huge metalscene. What happened in the most large in terms of metal has become? In the 70s there was a dictatorship in Brazil. We have 25 years lived in a dictatorship. During the dictatorship, there was little freedom, and there was little access to information. It was almost impossible to tools ... to find or something from the abroad to obtain. The dictatorship ended in 1985. When bands started with the release of the first Brazilian metal. That meant that while metal was with democracy. Organizing Rock In Rio was exactly right. It was also incredibly high. There were ten days 1,380,000 people. It was the first time that everyone knew as metal and metal fans. It may seem funny now, you want to see Whitesnake. It seems crazy, but the sight of White Snake, Ozzy Osbourne, Scorpions and Iron Maiden ... was breathtaking for a Brazilian in 1985. I would not say that our metal was free, but we pleaded for it. We pleaded for that freedom. We had a helicopter over, and while we came closer, we saw smoke in the distance. The steam appeared to be that of the bodies of the fans afsloeg. You saw many rare distracted by his joy. It felt like a big family, or religion. Some images are in that this music could be for the inauguration of Brazil as a free country. We are in Sao Paolo, Brazil, in Grandes Galerias. In other words, that the Galerias Rock. I certainly think that metal enormous in a country, as a shopping mall devoted to. Sepultura I heard for the first time, when I was 13 or 14. It was almost unbelievable that metal came from Brazil. It seems so far away from a completely different country. Sepultura-founder, Max Cavalera, is one of my heroes. And finally I get the chance for him to ask how it was then. Everything was a problem: What do we play and how we arrange money? But we wanted to really form a bond. The money was never really the problem, that we arranged around it. Even for our appearance, we found something. In Destruction's album saw bullet belts. We should then appear, especially ball straps. I think it was Igor; when we use batteries to each other adhesives, and the photo taken from a distance ... so that the bullet belts seem. "That does not work," I said. So we rommelden with batteries, and it looked pretty good out. We have bullet belts, Now what? A large madhouse, from the first note. My country, the largest football stadium, nobody thought we would save but we did. Many boys compared with them, they started the same, with nothing. They started a metal band, and now of life. Sepultura is our pride, our Brazilian flag. Previously, Brazil was not recognized as a metal country. But it is now recognized as metal country thanks Sepultura. Talking about Sepultura outside Brazil if you talking about Pele or Amazon have. Sepultura belongs to Brazil, it is incredibly important. Sepultura surprised me when few years later ... an album full of traditional Brazilian musical additions. This surprised many metal fans, including their label. The label owner laughed us, why naked Indians in the Amazon why not just in New York. First he does not understand. But when we had understood it, it was great. Many medelanders thought that we the Americans had after monkeys. I feel that cunt, I prefer for their own sound. Cancer, which is a huge underground network. In Brazil I saw how their culture united in metal. But how about in Japan, known to Western influences. It is also known for its hard workers and organization. What little metal appears. What happens to the rebellion which has metal, and the Japanese culture. Perhaps I'll find out in Loud Park, metalfestival the largest in Asia. We played in a theater, with about 3000 places. And everyone Saturday neatly into place. They even had plaatsaanwijzers ... And we had no idea what would happen. We never believed that they would remain seated. It is impossible for you remains to Slayer. And at the first leap second everyone forward ... and the organizer has shocked the Jan Cancer, he had never seen. And while we played, the plaatsaanwijzers that everyone sat down. And everyone remained seated neatly. Now moshe crowd surfing and the Japanese too. We have seen the whole evolution. Since nothing was permitted, and what does. Japanese metal fans differ very think in terms of western metal fans. Ask whether they agree their emotions, oppression or misfortune ... expression through metal. Most will say no. In the western world, if you are looking for rebellion, or you just feel ... you'll be attracted to metal. That Japan is absolutely not true. As an example, fans at rock festivals often very good. If their waste down growl, she holds the later on, or take it back home. If metalfan maintain your image. During the concert ontpop you satanic ... but then you go back to your normal, nice personality. In everyday life I wear suits and ties, but listen to metal, at home or a concert, my life changed considerably. I feel happier, I am my emotions easily. Japan sometimes gets a bad name, by the use or lack of interaction. They are their other people who otherwise make We find it amazing there though the feelings mixed but on the other hand, it is their own, Japanese way of reacting. Yes. I love metal. Thank you. Waren all my interviews but so easy. I'll be a new generation Japanese metal fans against. But I am now looking for the old garde, which had the metal came here. According to rumors sit in Blackmore's a small bar. Named after Richie Blackmore, guitarist of Deep Purple. Deep Purple was in Japan in August 1972. This I thought a Deep Purple structured game had. But that was not the case. They add a lot of improvisation to their shows. The final was crazy, something we had never seen. Everyone knalde forward. Richie Blackmore had his guitar the other way. On that night was Deep Purple legendary. It is now hip for men in the 50 ... to reunite with old band school together and to act. And a song she always play 'Highway Star'. Everyone wants to be the guitarist and solo play. But the singers are incredibly much effort to get the high tone. Kiss was a few years later. When she came out of their aircraft, they were fully up and costume. If they could only Immigration Service does not pass. They had all the make-up off to pass it. Then they have it again done, and their costumes were. They were fully dressed from the Immigration Service, while thousands of fans flowed. If you the videos from the 70s is you can even fainting. The pop of the fireworks and the fire itself was the biggest shock. But make-up on stage was nothing new. In Japan was in Kiss make-up especially recalls the Kabuki Theater. Therefore, many Japanese felt a kind of intimacy with them. After some time spent to in Japan ... I realized that there is more going was a Western obsession. This was totally different than what I've seen somewhere else. But I have yet to know whether the Japanese have something unique in terms of metal. Good memories Marty Friedman, guitar hero. I am the guitarist of multi-platinum band, Megadeth. Megadeth has often gerockt Japan, and the rest of the world. I have chosen to Japan live to Japanese pop music ... playing on Japanese TV. In Japan, everything is possible. I, for example, a project what "Death Panda" hot. It is a 100% metal project, but 48 Japanese zangeresjes. That can never be in America, or anywhere. Every culture has something gaafs. And metal, America and England, you know what I mean. Other countries did so after. In Japan, my favorite type of metal is Visual K. Visual K is an incredible phenomenon. Men who glam / gothic dress. Very extravagant in heavy metal. Not like the Twisted Sister clothes from their mothers wore. Of all the bands that do X-Japan the largest. And musically largely the best. I played piano from my fourth. My first concert was that of Kiss. I think I was nine or ten years. I looked like my mother to. That was quite a change in my life. In the beginning we hated the music. We were the black sheep. Nobody wanted to interview us. But when we have more than one million albums sold, they had no choice. X-Japan, the band that I Japanese rock music was done. They have the fastest and hardest music, next juicy sweet ballads. And I love sweet juicy ballads. In America I would never be in addition to a number as "Fight Fire with Fire" on an album set. Songs that sound like Barry Manilow besides normal metal songs. People who listen to the Japanese bands, know nothing of the world's biggest bands. It is not strange if they do not know Metallica. It is interesting to see that this two genres do not mix ... while they are so similar. People of international bands hold found that Japanese bands are often not good. What is Visual K and why is not metal you know. Because metal is cool. That is the answer. Cancer, please check it. We are just in Mumbai, and now we 'Global Metal' find. Between here somewhere. I got a brilliant idea. If someone come out colored paper. So far I countries sound metalscene visited. But in India it just begins, and no major metal band has played here. At school I read often about India, in my anthropology books. It is one of the oldest cultures in the world. But I see that rapidly modernize. And metal is not the only western influence that creeping in here. People find great cameras here. They know that a film made , and want as close as possible. It is clear that the home of Bollywood is. Bollywood movies are cheap films, with much dancing in it. It is one of the largest industries in India. All children listen to the remix, and Indian pop stars, but the radio running. Everyone, what religion is, listening to Bollywood music. It all sounds quite amusing and you can shake your ass on. But there is no rationale. It is soft music for soft people. My music must be powerful. So I listen metal. Metal Fans in Mumbai explained how difficult it is a place for concerts to be found. Now they have a place at a beach. The place is used for weddings than extreme metal. This metal is something separate. I grew up metal Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath and Dio and so on. And every time I hear a CD, I totally in it. People who listen to metal are often very passionate. It gives you an identity. It is an escape. We do not all what society asks us to do. We want to do what we want. We want our lives for themselves. We want to get for nothing. How we live, who should marry me. It is not America, you on your 18th house has to. People are old and their parents. Parents are a type of guards. They must first approve. What do your parents of metal? If even adults, think of you career, you should ever marry. Why, and why is not it? What a noise you hear is, Please turn off. On the one hand, we have a metal show On the other hand, a traditional Indian wedding. People are very orthodox and religious here. They are not new things. The audience consists mainly of metal engineers, graduates or alumni. They are all for what they believe. There is a lot of discrimination in society. On the basis of religion, sex and much more. The metal is not. Everyone is free to be who he is. It is a great whole. We as a band a religion: the music. We all have a religion, some one other than me. That takes nothing from the music. Music is like air, it is there for everyone. So we have a guest with a Gandhi-shirt, and another guy with an Iron Maiden shirt. In the same band. We have Gandhi in our hearts. You get from us. Hopefully your success in achieving your goals. Thank you. Can I put? You wear it? This is Indi-blackmetal. This visit to India I am aware that my school dated. This country is undergoing great changes. Indian metal and my friends among the middle class. Metal is for them a means to release it ... a society full of rules. But India is not the only country where major changes are taking place. China is increasingly open to the West. But the government keeps strict control on culture and music that the country inkomt. And I'm not even sure if I come through customs, 300 pounds of camera equipment with tourist visas. In China they know me as S. Duhh. It took quite some effort to visa to get, I hope that it will succeed. What do you say? - That we are here on vacation. We are here on holiday, because the area. Next. That was a cinch. They asked something? - Nothing at all. "Walk through. "Welcome to China." Cycling Beijing. I do not know whether this is health. The bike feels pretty good. I have my doubts about the air. China has 20% of the world and 90% of my shirts come from. And just as in India, no major metal band has ever occurred. But on the Internet I found a place where they Metal sales. 666 The Rock Shop in Beijing. Previously, the Chinese youth simply obedient to their parents and teachers. We thought for ourselves. We had no freedom of speech. Through music we can express. We do what we want. It takes no matter what others think. The old generation, including my parents, of the ancient Chinese stamp. What a mix of Confucianism and communism. Chinese parents do not want a child with long hair. Or a tattoo, or that they learn to play guitar. The MIDI School was founded in 1993. China had become freer ... and many young people wanted music learning. At school they learn all genres. Also metal and blues, but just as good jazz and improvisation. China is 20 years from the outside world been completed. Musical, the western world rock had a history of 50 years. That we had in 10 years learning. Heavy Metal drum solos are very recognizable. In many countries bands from Western countries on tour. In China it is different, no major bands have been here. How is metal in China come? 80% of the youth has metal by to the band Tang Dynasty to listen. It was the first metal band in China, and very good. Unbelievable. This does not exist. - It is real. I am Kaiser, I am from New York, and was 12 when I bought my first Kiss album Only when I moved to China in 1988, I started a real metal band. That band was called Tang Dynasty. The real story about the relationship I started, beginning with a kutgitaartje. And of course I had to find some musicians. The first person I meet is Ding. Ding was well with the blue guitar ... he knew not only how a was playing guitar in overdrive. And then practice. I was Jack Black in School of Rock. I said, "Ding, you are a metalfan, you are clearly a head banger. He was incredibly sing almost magical. And I knew, we were the best tape that China had ever seen. We were a phenomenon, we were in stadiums, but most people who came were not metal fans, but just curious. We have often been looked Saturday as if they saw water burning. And I heard continuously: What does' Is that really her? " The latest metal works for Chinese men. It grows quite easily, and is pretty good out there. All the major combatants of the past also had long hair. They were sometimes so. But it is long hair. Long hair says something about power. Tang Dynasty is something many people know about China. But how are they western metal? In 1994, many music China in what was metal. By students, children of diplomats and multi-nationals who tapes or copies think amen. What you saw were much CD Catalogs remains. Many labels do a test release for their artists, this CD will be destroyed. They are not really destroyed, but go directly to the port. You could millions of CDs of every genre available. Suddenly everything was suddenly available. And also very cheap. Most cunt was natural, but there was always some fun in between. Heavy Metal in China is made after Tang Dynasty and illegal CDs. In Beijing, I have a growing discovered underground. A scene of the most obscure, extreme metal is that I now have heard on my trip. I am Nong Yong. And I am 34 years old. I've always been interested in music, but metal was only in 1998. I was deeply impressed that you had such music. So I started a band and we went to metal. In the beginning I heard in the first that music played. I'm having a certain emotion, in difficult times, I feel very dark. And how I feeling? By metal. The important thing is that metal the youth a way, ... their emotions directly and free to express. They demanded their forward hatred and feelings. I grew up during the end of the Chinese Revolution. If the youth in my time arguing with each other had they went to the entrance of the school and they beat each other out. I think the Chinese metal Government helped to some ... social problems, because the youth Board now know their hatred and emotions. Chinese metal reflects injustice, inadequate political and corruption in the government. It also gives the poor living to poverty and unfair treatment. I think the time has come where Chinese things are applied. Something on the one hand, modern, and on the other hand, unmistakably Chinese. In this movement, I would like to hear. I have just come from the most densely populated countries world, where no significant metal band ever did. And now one of the poorest countries, the largest Muslim population in the world. There were some big metal concerts. Even during a heavy dictatorship. We are the fourth or fifth largest population group in the world. With about 300 million people in Indonesia. Unemployment is huge here. Officially, about 10-11%, but unofficially it is about 40%. And that many people. It is a very large country. You have the most beautiful, geweldigste buildings, and just as the slums. Many people live literally in the gutter. It is ironic to see that many poor people in the country ... a mountain of diamonds have and a sea of gold. Ironically, right? This is Indonesia. There is much in line with Brazil, where I come from, I also grew up in a lot of cancer, and our texts are also on, as Indonesian fans that read, can they feel connected. They come from a similar country. Inequality, everywhere people dead. Their texts are there. It corresponds with what in this country. Halfway through these guys were so crazy, a big bunch of cancer, untenable. After the show was stopped, and everyone was beaten with bamboo sticks They had 20,000 people in ground, completely still. I had never seen such a thing, none of us. Abnormal. It was our first time here. Sorry for everything fell tonight. It is logical that boys Brazil, India or Indonesia ... are rebellious. They feel so cunt where and how they should live. What do you recommend? And that brings metal look. They came from everywhere. Dong Gala, Surabaya, even Bali. Everyone had to see Metallica. I had my shoes father to sell a ticket. And yes, my father was furious at me. I remember that when we go super why there were many people outside, and the stadium was in the rich part of Jakarta, where politicians and the rich lived. There were thousands of guests, most still in their adolescence. And Metallica played, and some could not inwards and when it was a big chaos. We were playing and we saw fire, smoke, we heard sirens. They had the whole district 's on fire stabbed. The army joined us. I called again: 'Sir, I have a ticket, I want to go inside. " We could not enter. He stared at us: 'jerk with your black shirts, kutcommunisten. We all ran away. I was beaten my head, while I had a ticket. They beat everyone, if you had a ticket or not. Metallica's concert after all rock and metal shows banned. The international bands then. It would be a bad impact on the Indonesian youth. It was a mass demonstration as we had in 1998. The Evolution Meir, when Suharto aftrad by the student movement. After Suharto aftrad, there was was a type of energy Friday During the Suharto era was You do not express. Suddenly we were liberated from oppression. 52 years is not short term. It felt almost as if we all could do. Shortly after Suharto aftrad were a serious political underground. Most metal band singing in Jakarta political and social things. What I find more something for punk than metal feel. But the most popular Indonesian metalband Tengkorak, more controversial ideas. What are you trying to express by Tengkorak's music? We sing about our dissatisfaction of capitalist countries, third world countries because they always in verdomhoekje places. As you know, the majority Indonesian Muslim. Therefore, they say, we a terrorist country. " And we do not agree and respect that. Most songs have a strong social or political, But there is a song 'Destroy Zionism' hot. Why that? Zionism is a Jewish system. These Jews have a system which is not proper, because their aim is to destroy the followers of Islam. The Zionism must be destroyed. It would no longer be. And if necessary, Israel should be very of the world disappear. People hear that song and see you ... your jacket with swastika with a slash through it, do you not think that if a contrast is seen? We are not against the Jewish people, only against their system. They are against the policy, they find that people ... according to the Islam way of living. I am a born Muslim, but follow that religion anymore. For me religion is an individual thing. It is between yourself and God. Muslims learn about peace. Each religion teaches about peace. They learn not how you make enemies, or how you should conduct war. This is done by people who to impose their will on others. And these are bad people, what religion they follow. whether Muslims, Christians or religion whatsoever. I think that is bad people. I am ready. I am in a mosque in Indonesia, and it is the end ... of Ramadan. And we continue our new friends inside. Long ago I got my feet washed. Good Muslims would have to be me , or like the others you see. Very normal. They pray, go to their work. Like me. They are Muslims. Metal is for life and for my life. I have friends. The I get to live music. But religion is my relationship with my God. Metal is always for controversy; it has always been discounted at bell authorities and religion. But as I already saw in Indonesia, it can sometimes represent hatred. If a country knows what hatred is, it is called Israel. So what I wonder is, what the effect on metalscene here. The reason why, for this country and especially Jerusalem: The culture of this country is complicated, old, and especially mixed. Here is a Jewish cemetery, a church and a mosque. Thus, the old Jerusalem, a harmony of colors and prayers. Everyone is here. Abraham, Jesus, Mohammed. I think for an artist important is to reflect its culture. We live in one of the most controversial places on earth. And probably one of the most hostile places on earth. The impact of violence goes up. And therefore we may more extreme than other bands. Then I went black metal listening, I listened mainly Norwegian black metal. I really love, and feel very connected to. They actually sing songs about stories they pass from generation to generation have been told. but when we viewed the property, they have in their books, we do that really. If you've experienced something, and you write a song about However, it is when you 've heard during a history lesson. Because we live in a country where jest approaching reality. In Jerusalem, here and throughout the region ... the three major religions: Islam, Judaism and ... Christianity is responsible for these wars. Jews killed Christians, Christians Muslims killed, Muslims killed Jews and as , the circle is repeated. If you are in Israel is 18, you the army. After school I had the army. That I really do not. That will and I really do not. I want to play in a band. I want to meet people from same as I keep. I think that if our service not fulfill our country there is. I do not enjoy, but if we do not take that step ... we swallowed. We have to just do it. First was a Salem occult band. That is the name. Salem, witchcraft ... But then you realize that your reality angstiger than the demon, too. It is frightening to know that someone ... on the street can inflate because of your hatred. If I walk on the street I am not afraid to by demons be attacked. Or Pinhead from Hellraiser. That makes me scared. I've seen those films, and like them. I'm afraid of the living, and their deeds. Someone from the Parliament was mad at us, because we had a number retreaded, what related to the Holocaust was brought. He said: "The Holocaust is sacred, you can not make it metal. That you can not play in bars, where people are dancing or headbanging. Only because it is holy. But there was someone else from the parliament who said: "This is a good way for the new generation to learn about the Holocaust. " Auschwitz, the meaning of pain. The way that I want you to die. One song, which is always controversial comments called, is Angel of Death by Slayer. What do you think of that song? Auschwitz ... The meaning of pain. - The way that I want you to die. What do you feel? I do not think that the Jews wanted to belittle. I think it is not Nazi band. I think that the most controversial metal song ever. And I will not lie to you. It bothers me too. Because my father has experienced the Holocaust. But I see no negative. I play it on my stereo, and a DJ. I do not personally. I think that just shows Slayer that they are against the Holocaust. If they were in favor, they deny the Holocaust. Or some great story about it. So you think that the Angel of Death horrors it serve? It is a monument to all that misery, what may never be repeated. Although not a Nazi band Slayer is, there is a few ideas what these bands did. Varg Vikernes is in Norway for church burnings and murder. He is also known for his fascist and racist ideas. I was surprised that Israel also this story appears. It was 1990, Salem had just the live demo Millions Slaughtered delivered. When tape-trading was still common. Norwegian blackmetal just started. If Grishnackh heard our music. The title track, Millions Slaughtered, about the Holocaust. He wrote us back that music was cool, but the texts stupid. "It is a pity that Hitler work has not completed. It was just before the Gulf War. "That Saddam may do it." And it is not just texts, it is a part of us. It seems clear to me that we were quite pissed. So he was quite pissed answer. We used some words you definitely not want to hear here. A few months later, the police in our singer at the door. Those who hate you in Norway? There was a bomb in the mail. Wherever we are, know people only the bad news. The war and stuff. We try the good news to be. When we played in Turkey sang there people, and they did so with their hands. This is mostly just for Muslims as they pray. As if they have fixed the Koran. That is incredible. They are metal fans. All these wars between religion, all these slaughter, it's very confusing. We all believe in same God, we , all these misery and confusion stop. If we wanted to sing about dark things done not. Saturday there is darkness in this world. Therefore, we talk about the light. Of all the metal fans who have contacted me, I was most impressed of people in Iran. Unfortunately I had no visa for that country. So instead, we Iranezen ... in Dubai, there gathering for Desert Rock. The only metalfestival in the Middle East. I am Armin, I am 29 years old. I work as a mechanical engineer, I listen from my teens to metal, I love it really. Can you say something about the limitations to metal to get in Iran? There are no CDs sold that is the biggest limitation. This allows the music to life. You may not sell metal shirts. Jeans were forbidden and long hair was cut by the police. I was brought to the police: "Why do you have long hair? Adore you Satan? Are you in such a terrible metal band? " I was arrested by the religious police for my long hair and my Slayer shirt. I was just back from a Slayer Concert in Turkey I was just forgotten that thing prohibited. A few friends of mine ended up in the cell, were shaved bald and beaten out, Satanisten because they would be. What is not so was. They looked just like metal fans. They consider it antimoralistisch. They say that too much tension with entails what is not good for music, in the Islamic context. There were some actions, such as two or three years ago. In an action, said the singer, we Retreading Morbid Angel and Slayer, but there was no singing at. That was tough and aggressive. And we had to sit. Later the show was canceled. The current system may we do not play Western music, not only metal. And so metal fans here isolated of what the real world. Some were new, who sent us a photo. She had been in Iran, for family visits. And they had a picture of 'Slayer', sprayed on a wall in Iran. They even had photos of they were next in order to prove ... that they were there, and that Iran really was. And I looked there and thought: Wow, Slayer in a Muslim country. We spoke Tom in Japan and he described a picture ... a Slayer logo on a wall. Since we have quite a few of them. Have you ever seen in your country? I've even done in my country. In large parts of the Middle East ... censor the government and religious authorities metal. However, Dubai seems completely open to everything Western is. It is also of the 50 fastest growing tourist cities in the world. I need some metal fans who search here are born and raised. I see what they have metal here can tell. My full name is Omar Abdula Aziz Abdula Mohammed Khan. My license is about as big. What I aanheb is best known as a dish dash. It is not a Ku Klux Klan outfit, but it reflects the heat of the sun, they are very good, and ventilate very well. So good for metal to play. In highschool I played Purple Haze on stage in a black ... of these, and with a bandana. Metal is something of the Western world. And it is a part of the verwereldlijking. What do you think of metal and how it is about the world. About verwereldlijking during the Middle Ages ... things just went from East and West. If that continues to circulate. That is something gaafs that we get here. And that sounds great tool that I use. The Indians have, that we mix. I do not think it a bad idea, as in a natural way. Thanks to the Internet for a major driver for the ... verwereldlijking is, information is everywhere. I do not think anyone in the world many had to download it. We found new bands on the internet, downloaded and listened to the music, we could not buy. Our apologies to all bands, but it was the only way. Many fans we talked downloading the only way for music to come. What do you feel? That is great. It's great order things to share. In the beginning of the Internet age I think we were somewhat perplexed. But now we find it best. Thanks to the Internet, everything is at hand, worldwide. Great. If these guys music so get that great. You can now download music, what you want. It is easy for people in the Middle East in order to obtain metal. It is bigger. It is certainly bigger. The Desert Rock Festival is a great day for metal. Lebanon, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, every country in the Middle East. From each country are people here, for the music. It may also fuck ever happen. My first metal show ever, the day after my birthday. And the best birthday ever. If you have a difficult time, what our country is not strange, This is a discharge. You stop your ambition and dreams it. You want to express, but do not see enough opportunities to do so. In metal we found something appealing, what with our ... problems, wars, aggression and oppression is. It gives us the opportunity our anger to express in a positive way, so we are not a negative way, to do so. An opportunity to join in lol , without political bullshit. This is more than important. It is essential. The stories of these fans make me realize how hard metal fans here. For some fans Desert Rock ... the only way in which their dedication to heavy metal can make. And that is something I, as Canadian metalfan never to have had. I have traveled over 40,000 km since Wacken in Germany. But I must still make a stop. I go back to India, to Bangalore. What is something unique. My favorite band, Iron Maiden, playing as first metal band in India. And with 30,000 fans for the fences, This is a show where I should be. This is the largest show we ever had. I do not think there is a loud public anywhere in the world, there are so twenty years of los-up feelings.
