Where's-- where's Bernard? All of this was Mom. Oh, my God. She was... trying to protect us... when Robin moved in... from you. Don't be ridiculous. I would never have hurt you. I have been protecting you. I've been protecting you for years, I mean, I got rid of the drama. I-I got rid of the yelling. Think about how much happier we were once she left. (quietly) You-- you killed her. You killed her. Don't be sad, okay? (stammering) This is totally fixable! We'll go back to the way it was-- just us! Just you, and me, and Abby. No Mom. No Robin. Just us. Weren't the past five years great? Listen. Listen. Why don't we just stop this, and we'll figure something out? What is it that you don't understand? Robin? We don't need her! We don't. Robin! Robin! Robin! I'm sorry, I really am. She was... a fantastic woman. Robin! James: Robin! Robin! ♪ ♪ She can't hear you. I tried to stop it... I did, but... Mom got her. She's forgetting... I'm the longest relationship you've ever had. I'm your protector. This is our family. I love you, Dad. Ah! Abby, come here! Abby, seriously? Nothing was haunting your mother but you! That's not true. That's not true. James: Kellie, listen. Honey... you-- you need some help... but we're gonna get you some. We're not gonna be together anymore? You just-- you destroyed everything. No! Robin: My baby! Kellie, stop! Come here. Untie Daddy, honey. (pounds on door) By the way, your art sucks! Your hand... (grunts) Robin: Stop! Kellie! No, Kellie! Stop it! Just some defensive wounds. They'll see my side. They always do. Kellie, stop! Dad. You replaced me. No. No. (crying) You replaced me. No, honey. (gasping) No! (Kellie whimpers) ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Abby: I know, I know. I still like the other one better. No, they're asleep. They're tired. (James whispers) Babe, did you hear her? Is she up? (Robin whispers) Oh, I'll check. Who are you talking to? You can tell me. ♪ ♪ Come on. Meh. Just... exploring. (chuckles) (sighs) When are we gonna stop moving around? As soon as we find the right place to settle. We just need to regroup a bit. But, you know, home can be wherever we want it to be. Okay? Mm-hmm. I'm gonna go wake up your dad, okay? (James whispers) Listen, is everything all right? (Robin whispers) We have to keep our eye on her.
