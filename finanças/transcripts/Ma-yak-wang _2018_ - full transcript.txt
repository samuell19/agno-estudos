THIS FILM IS INSPIRED BY HISTORICAL EVENTS IN 1970S KOREA ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL PERSONS OR ORGANIZATIONS IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL NETFLIX PRESENTS Methamphetamine. Philopon. Also known as crank. It decreases your need for sleep and makes you fearless. This incredible drug that literally gets you high was invented during the Pacific War. Japan immediately used this drug for military purposes. The first ones to get high on this drug in the history of mankind were kamikaze pilots. They took crank and entered the enemy lines without any fear. They gave crank to factory workers to make them work without sleep and gave it to soldiers to make them become fearless in war. After the war ended, there were many addicts who couldn't forget the high it gave them. Once the Japanese government put a ban on crank, Japanese drug dealers turned to Busan, a nearby city in Korea. During the time when everyone was determined to work hard for better lives, Japan's need for more factories and Korea's drive toward expanding exports coincided. That's how the heyday of crank began. There was a self-made man who started this golden age of crank. "Made in Korea." The legendary drug king who dominated the Japanese market with the finest crank there was. He was a law-abiding citizen by day and a drug king by night. He lived two different lives, and was both loved and hated by everyone of the era. It's this man right here. Lee Doo-sam. 1972, BUSAN This is the goldsmith I told you about. He is also fluent in Japanese. My name is Lee Doo-sam. If you screw this up tonight, dozens of jewelry stores in Busan will end up going bankrupt. So you'd better stay alert. - It's been a while, sir. - Hey. The gold is real, but the watch is... Everybody, freeze! - Come over here. - I'm sorry! It's the cops. The cops are here. - There's nothing here! - Wait. Don't move. Hey, catch them. Over here. Open this. There's nothing here. - Let go of me! - Over here! Hold on! Hey, catch them! Damn it! Hey, get over here. It's cooked well. It was hard trying to fool the Japanese on your first day, wasn't it? Why didn't you tell him beforehand? Eat up. Count them. - So, you went to college? - I dropped out after paying the tuition. No wonder you seemed smart. When did you learn goldwork? I wanted to learn a technique to earn a living. So I chose to deal with something expensive. That's your reason? That doesn't mean you own all that gold. I pretend like I do. Otherwise, my work will be no fun. There are 152 bills. Two of them are ripped. Don't forget to take your share. That's the most important part. You can keep working with this guy. Here. Gosh, hurry up. This is incredibly fresh. - How much is this? - They're all fresh. Look. Get moving, will you? - When did I say that? - That's enough. Stop it. Move! Pushcart coming through! Here you go. Relax your fingers. Hey, did you enjoy your piano lesson? - Smile. - Look over there. - Smile, everyone. It won't take long. - Look over there. Here we go. One, two, three. One more time. - I'm Kwak. - Nice to meet you. - Hello, Mr. Kwak. - Doo-sam, let me tell you something. When men meet each other, they exchange business cards, not money. All of those guys are big shots in Busan. If you're in that group, you won't get caught even if you do bad deeds. Hey, Mr. Kwak. He's a director at Yongdu Shipping. - Yongdu Shipping? - Yes. I've never heard of it. They don't operate fishing vessels. They operate the Yongman, which used to be a US Navy ship. Mr. Kwak wants to offer the sailors side jobs for when they go back and forth Japan to fix the ship. We just need to borrow the ship for our mutual benefit. This ship is really clean. This used to be the US Navy's, right? Does that mean this ship is like the little brother of the USS Missouri? Here. Please check it. Well, I'll get going, then. Doo-sam, this is delicious. It melts in my mouth. Don't eat it all yourself. Share it with the kids. You're unbelievable for someone who lives in a church. The ones who collect taxes are the real thieves. Even in the Bible, tax collectors are considered worse than whores. Mun Ik-jeom didn't declare those cottonseeds he brought in. My gosh, you look like a completely different person. Just don't get caught, whether it be smuggling or cheating. I'm a pastor's daughter, for goodness' sake. Should we turn on the record player? Gosh, don't. My goodness. Seriously, stop it. Kids, look. Will you please stop? My goodness, seriously. - Dance with us. - There's no stopping me if I start. Doo-sam! We've got a problem. Doo-hwan's about to get beaten to death. What? Why? You punk! Damn it! You motherfuckers! You motherfuckers! - You sons of bitches! - You little punk! You lunatic! - You little punk! - Stop it. Stop! What did you say? Just die, you little punk. Look at you, all covered in blood! Are you his older brother? I'll pay you back for everything. He may seem reckless, but he's way too chicken-hearted to have taken much. Aren't I right? Answer me! Please forgive him. I'd make him pay with his life if I could. Hey. You have to do whatever it takes to make him pay with his life if you truly think he should. Don't you agree, you piece of shit? Who are you? I normally don't mix my drinks. What are you doing? - Doo-sam. - Hold him. I will... I'll drink it. Fucking hell! You bastard! Gosh, look at him. Are you okay? - Gosh. - Is your ear still attached to your head? Okay, let's go. Let's go eat. Hey, Doo-sam. What brings you here? - Nothing much. - Doo-hwan, are you hurt? No, I'm fine. - Why are you here? - What? Here, come have some smokes with me. My aunt's in-law in Osaka travels around Japan with a troupe to do local performances. That's not the main point. The thing is, he's hospitalized because his appendix burst. But he needs to deliver something by today. What is it? Smuggling using the rice cookers isn't profitable anymore. So, what is it? It's crank. Crank? Do you know how to gut a fish? If you screw this up, I'll cut your stomachs open. We do our business based on trust, so we don't work with people who don't trust us. Let's go. Hey! What the fuck? What? They're expensive. I don't deal with anything that's cheap. OSAKA, JAPAN Then we should collect our money from the start... So you're telling me that Hideki's... appendix burst? Are you Korean? Yes. I'm from the North. My parents once lived on Jeju Island. Oh, really? Well, if we were born a little earlier, we'd all be from the same country. I'm so glad to meet you. I was born in Manchuria, but I somehow ended up in Busan. Every time I meet Koreans living abroad, it feels as if I met my siblings. Are you crazy? He is... a commie. So what? He's from the pro-North Korean group. If things go wrong, we might get arrested as commies. I'd rather get caught as a commie or a smuggler than just starve to death. I'll take care of everything, so just stay quiet. - You're hungry, aren't you? - Yes. Goodness. I didn't even get to pee on my way here. Hey. Why don't we go get something to eat? Look. Bring me one more of this. If you get caught making crank in Japan, you get shot to death. Is that why they're building factories in Korea? The factory itself isn't a big deal. What matters is the cook. Depending on who the cook is, you either get a nice product or complete garbage. There's this really famous cook. Professor Baek. Professor Baek? He was brought here as a forced laborer and ended up working in pharmaceuticals. The stuff he makes is really famous. The ones made in Korea are the best. Taiwanese ones are no good. You know how good Koreans are with handicrafts. Korea has good water. Busan especially has the perfect water and air for cooking crank. That's why the color comes out amazing. I had no idea. It's because of good water? Wait a minute. Then what would happen if we import the chemicals from Japan, cook it in Korea, and sell it back in Japan? It'll be a gold mine if we manage to make it and sell it. It'll be a bonanza for us, right? President Park Chung-hee has issued a decree to wipe out illegal smuggling. Even the KCIA's Head of Inspection is coming? Chief Kim, you bastard! You'd better take responsibility. We knew nothing about it. Damn it. Do you want to see me get tortured in the KCIA headquarters? We can't get a hold of Doo-sam. What should we do? Chief Kim. I'll help you escape the blame, so please cover for me. In exchange, I'll give you Lee Doo-sam. They asked me to come here. Where is everyone? That little bastard. You asked me to come here. I'm a busy man, you know. I came all the way here amidst my busy schedule. Wait. Hold on... Mr. Kwak, what's with your face? Who are these people? Hey, smuggler. How dare you use this ship to smuggle saccharin? It... It wasn't saccharin. Gosh, do you want to visit our KCIA headquarters? I'll kindly pour some spicy soup into your nostrils. I really didn't know anything, sir. I'm telling you the truth. Please let me go. I'd never have done such a thing if I knew this ship belonged to the KCIA. How dare you use the government's precious ship to satisfy your own greed? You little scum. Gosh. Please don't kill me. I beg of you. I have three kids and three younger sisters who haven't gotten married yet. Is that piss? - He peed so much. - That's gross. Goodness, are you scared? Should we call your mommy? Isn't he Captain Choi of the Yongpal Gang? I heard Captain Choi controls all the smuggling routes to Japan. Apparently, he's in here for adultery, not smuggling. Your boss ran off to Japan. You're the only one who got caught. You were a complete lackey. Do you get that? Gosh, look where all that loyalty got you. How's your health? Listen to me carefully. You know how sincerely Kim Gu's mother cared for him when he was in jail, right? Our family depends on you now. Our family has always depended on me. What are you thinking? Are you planning to escape prison? Hey. Do you have some money? Goodness. I guess you like being in here. Why don't you just stay here forever? Public servants are bound to be involved in this. Try your best to convince him and bring him over. Okay? BUSAN CUSTOMS The deputy chief security officer here went to the same high school as me. But the thing is, he's very strict and stern. Yes, I'm sure he is. I mean, he spends his entire day among all the criminals. But regardless of how strict and stern he may be, I'm sure we'll be able to woo him and win his favor. Why do you want to talk to my husband? Goodness, you're his wife? I'm so sorry. I thought you were his daughter. You look extremely young. - You have a really nice house. - Wait. Hold on. Hello. Who are you? - Get out of here! - Wait, sir. - Just get lost. - My goodness. - What do you take me for? - Gosh. Hurry up and leave. Throw some salt out there! Sir, please! He's not an easy guy to convince. He won't suddenly become nice just because you woo him a little. ACCOUNT BOOK I don't care about any of that. I want you to take responsibility and win him over. BUSAN CUSTOMS, CHIEF KIM If you don't, I'll take that notebook and visit the KCIA headquarters. Inmate 1538. You're a tuberculosis patient now. You'll be on parole under the condition that you don't leave your designated area. You've been granted a stay of execution and will be released. Then do I need to stay at home? Would you rather stay here instead? I'll stay at home. You'd better be good to your wife until the day you die. Money may not be on your side, but your wife is. After having been abducted by unknown assailants, former New Democratic Party's presidential candidate, Kim Dae-jung, safely returned home in Mapo-gu, Seoul yesterday at around 10:20 p.m. after five days in captivity. To identify the ship used for the abduction, the police are investigating all the ships that departed from Kobe to Busan, including the Buja, the Hyoam, and the Yongman. Goodness. Are you sure he's getting out today? The tofu will go bad. Attention, everyone. The 10:20 a.m. bus to Daegu will depart soon. I have this new business plan. And it has solid prospects. We will import materials, manufacture the product with our skills, and export the product. Are you listening? Are you crazy? What if the cops come and look for you? Then do you just want me to stay at home? Do you want to starve to death? Just tell them I'm missing. Say you can't reach me. You must be eager to make me divorce you. Sook-kyung, you deserve to live a decent life for once. Just trust me and bear with me a little bit. Hey, you know Yuk Young-soo, the First Lady, right? You'll get to be someone like her, okay? You just wait. Let's see. I heard my old classmate lives somewhere around here. Where could it be? I heard I have to go through Captain Choi of Yongpal Gang to sail to Japan. Why did you get caught with that if you're so good at being sneaky? You went to jail for adultery, right? Goodness, look at you. Every man needs that kind of spirit. No wonder your colleague's wife moved in with you. Thank you. Captain Choi. Let's do business together. You're not even good enough to eat with me. Yes, I know that. You're way better than me. But are you going to keep living a lowly life like this? I heard something about you too. You got beaten up for using the KCIA's ship, didn't you? I heard you're really close to the narcotics squad chief. Let me use your connection. I'm going to sell Philopon. I'm talking about crank. Fuck off. I don't smuggle crank. All right. Just like you said, I almost got killed by the KCIA. Do you know what it's like to get beaten to death? My dad and my grandfather both got beaten to death. It's crazy. It's like a family tradition. That day, I told myself as I washed my bloody underwear that I'll become someone who has strong connections. You can't live in this country if you have no one to call when you're close to dying in vain. Captain Choi, let me borrow your connection. What about the chemicals? We'll import the chemicals from Taiwan, manufacture crank in Korea, and export it to Japan. It's our turn to go with the trend and make tons of money through exports. Selling crank to Japan is considered an act of patriotism. The Qing dynasty fell because of opium. We can make Japan fall with crank. One shipment of crank will help you make more than 100 shipments of rice cookers. You know the suppliers and I get the biggest share, right? Of course. And here. Women love this the most. I know because I used to work at a jewelry store. Shouldn't you two at least have a small wedding? Say hello. This is Chief Suh Sang-hoon from the narcotics squad. I'm Lee Doo-sam. I hope you watch over us. And there's something I picked up on my way here. It's nothing much. These days, I am really busy chasing down singers who smoke pot. I'm sure you know this very well, but the most important thing for a crank dealer is... never to do crank. You'd better keep that in mind. If you want to be there when your son enters college, you'd better not do crank. Why would I take that expensive stuff? You'll know what I mean the moment you try your first crank. The first time is the best. But things that start well don't end well. You've never seen anyone go broke because they couldn't forget the high from their first crank, have you? Anyway, did you find a cook? Life is all about fun, and crank dealing is all about finding a good cook. Professor Baek? You mean the Professor Baek I know? How stupid do you have to be to think of working with that guy? The first thing cops do when there's a robbery is to look for the locksmith. Professor Baek is the locksmith in this field. You're going to get fucked. Hello, sir. Gosh. This is Professor Baek. He's a legendary figure who brought crank to this land. I'm sure you already respect him even if I don't tell you to. He's the famous Captain Choi. He's been sailing to Japan ever since he was 15. And he's friends with the narcotics chief. Don't worry about getting busted. This is Wang Mun-ho. He's Chinese-Korean. He can handle all the shipping from Taiwan. And he's pretty good at English. Talk in English for us. He's also good at acupuncture and cupping. You should do cupping therapy for Professor Baek sometime. I don't think anyone could do a better job in gathering such a perfect group to represent our country. Doo-sook. Bring him a cup of Taster's Choice. Taster's Choice? She's my sister. She graduated second place in her class and was offered a secretary job at a bank, but I brought her here. She's just like me with numbers. She's very good at counting money. And he's my cousin, Lee Doo-hwan. He would've become big in the US if it weren't for me. You also speak a little English, don't you? Right? English... Have a seat. Come on. Sit. You see, I don't ask for much. I just want my kids to eat well and sleep warm. And if you stick by my side, you'll never have to starve to death even if your luck's rotten. You know, what matters is that we understand each other. Let's do this. Hello! What? What do you think of Lee Doo-sam? Well, he seems trustworthy. He's smart too. I think he's okay. What about his underling? Who? You mean Choi Jin-pil? He's the actual big gun here. Choi Jin-pil's the big gun, not Lee Doo-sam? Yes. Choi Jin-pil is the big gun. Choi Jin-pil is the big gun? Jin-pil keeps a separate ledger. He and Wang Mun-ho are embezzling money. Right? I knew it. Here. Take this money and stay low. Don't spend it all and find yourself in handcuffs. I'll call you. Did you not learn division in math class at school? Division. Isn't that what we learn in language class? "Don't cause divisions." We're going to have to count the numbers again. You'd be in jail if it weren't for me. You're able to make money because of me. What kind of bullshit is that? We do all the dirty work! You fucker, don't touch me. Good work, all right? Give the materials to Professor Baek. That little... One is musk. Musk has always been a precious fragrance that has the ability to revive people who are weak-hearted, agitated, or have fainted. And the other one makes musk seem like nothing. I heard you work for Captain Choi, who used to be in the Yongpal Gang. Who? Me? He's not my boss. I'm handling all the products myself. People in Osaka are already talking about how great our stuff is. You know, I felt upset to see all of our best products go to Japan. So I thought I'd sell some of our stuff in Busan. Gosh, my legs. My legs hurt so much since I've been kneeling for so long. Let's work together, Mr. Jo. Don't you think you'd be better off running a jewelry store? Aren't you better at making gold rings for babies? Whether it be gold or crank, everything I touch turns into money. Did I gain weight? Why's this jacket so tight? I heard the boss among all bosses in Kobe is from North Korea. Do you mean Soo-gon? We're like brothers. If I put in a word for you, you'll be able to transport your crank by his ship without a hassle. But he's not easy to deal with. Just like the bar girls in Ginza, he's very good at reading people. How about we do this? For now, I'll give you all the crank I'm planning to sell here. But help me go to Japan. I'll go persuade the Kobe boss who reads people and the Ginza bar girls. KOBE, JAPAN You know the yakuza organization named Yamaguchi-gumi, right? This place is their hometown. Those guys are the real yakuza. Once, they came to Busan and ordered black bean noodles. There were five of them, but they only ordered four. - Only four. - Why? They all are missing a finger. So what? "Ma'am, we'd like five servings, please." They only got four servings because they all are missing a finger. Just like this, you know? You don't need all your fingers, do you? Give me one that you use to pick your nose. Doo-sam, are you sure they are going to show up today? Stop acting up and wait here. A deal will be made here today. Yes, it's ready. It's Room 703. One is Lee Doo-sam from Busan, and the other one is Lee Doo-hwan. We will disguise ourselves as them and get rid of him. Yes, I understand. Hey. Close the door. Close it. Take the bag and go upstairs. It's Room 703. Why? Just do as I say. As soon as you get there, show them the product. - Tell them we're the ones from Busan. - Okay. Hurry. Go now! Stay alert, you punk. Please call Room 703 for me. Yes. Hello, this is Lee Doo-sam. We agreed to meet today. We arrived a bit early. By the way, I was wondering if you have agreed to meet... someone... other than us. No, that's not it. Aren't there any Koreans there? Damn it. I'm Lee Doo-sam from Busan, sir. Why can't they understand a damn thing? Ouch! One of our men is down! Go and get the bastard! Doo-hwan! Get that bastard! Get that guy in front of you! Get him! You piece of shit! Hurry up! - Let go, you jerk! - You little... - You bastards! - You punks! Doo-hwan! Hey, Doo-hwan! Catch him! Stop him now! You jerk! Which gang are you from? You jerk! We've taken care of everyone. You can come out now. I'm Lee Doo-sam. I'm Lee Doo-sam from Busan. - Doo-sam. - Yes? Drink up. Drink. This is a celebratory drink. Why don't we drink this together? Thank you. Cheers. Quit acting up! Hey, come over here. Come! I feel great! Hey, Doo-hwan. Doo-hwan! Wake up, you punk! ONE THOUSAND YEN 1974, BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE Will you clean the bathroom? It stinks of urine. I'm Prosecutor Kim In-gu from Seoul. Oh, hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Suh Sang-hoon from Ministry of Health. Hello. Come on. Let me introduce you to everyone. Let's all say hello. He's the prosecutor from Seoul who will be working with us. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Prosecutor Kim In-gu. What are you doing, Sook-kyung? I'm cooking ox bone soup since my husband's home. It's not him you're cooking, right? I'll take his knee bone out and make some soup with it if I ever catch him cheating on me. Oh, my. I just can't get you. - Do you like him that much? - Of course. I love him. Let's get divorced. Have you gone nuts? Listen to me. I'm supposed to be missing right now. That can be the reason for our divorce. If you divorce me for that, I won't have to be on the run anymore. Then what about me? Remember those mental patients at Minister Kang's prayer house? You know the ones who can't even remember their own names? Bring me one of their ID cards. Why? So you can marry one of them. Don't you get it? I'll be living under his identity, and you'll fall for the new me and get married. Sook-kyung, let me tell you something. One man isn't enough for a woman like you. I really don't have the guts to live with you anymore. Look at you. Are you happy that you will get married again? Have you gone mad? Check out a rich neighborhood. Let's move to one of the big houses there and start a new life. You can open up a nice piano academy. Although my husband is currently in the food distribution business, he's an incredibly cultured man. He has perfect pitch. Listen. Hey. How's your health? Mr. Lee. How about we expand out of Busan and start developing the domestic market? It's not that I haven't thought of doing that. What's wrong? Are you scared? No, that's not it. It's way different from getting Japanese people hooked on crank. Our country's already in chaos with all the student riots. Let's think about it a bit more. Look at this drug dealer worrying about his country. You're quite the patriot. My gosh, what's with Prosecutor Kim? He learned how to investigate like the FBI from the US Army. But why can't he catch anyone? What? That's not fake money. It's Prosecutor Kim's loan for his new house. Is everyone here? Today... Hey, come inside. This guy is... a druggie. Hello. Today, we'll be catching a crank dealer that's a member of the Sunggang Gang. Our code word is "Janis Joplin." But those guys are really careful. I've never even seen any of them myself. It's okay. You'll do fine. - I'll try my best. - Okay. - Chief Suh. - Yes? Don't be nervous. I'm not nervous. I'D LIKE TO BUY JANIS JOPLIN'S RECORDS Who's waiting to buy Janis Joplin's album? Please answer the phone. I love Janis Joplin. The way to get an album... Hello? Where? Where? Oh, okay. Why are these punks coming exactly on time today? JEIL MEDICAL CLINIC Is this the medical clinic? Did the green truck arrive? Gosh, he should be there by now. This guy was fertilizing the field and got bitten by a poisonous snake. He left in his truck. Gosh, he must've passed out on his way there. What are you doing? Hurry up and check outside. Are you okay? Who got bitten by a snake? What? Sir. - What? - Roll down the window. - I heard you got bitten by a snake. - No. - The snake... - Did you get bitten? - No. - Will you please open the door? You have the wrong truck. Sir. Are you really okay? Are your eyes twitching? - Let's get out of here. - Sir. Hurry up and drive! - Hey! - Follow that car! Stop right there! That little bastard. Stop! Where did you get Philopon? I bought saccharin to cook some sweet noodles. Why did you go to Japan? To meet a friend. Which friend? A friend of mine. You met a North Korean friend? Why did you meet a North Korean? What is this about? I used to work at the Public Security Division. I caught a dozen commie spies. But how many of them do you think were actual spies? You should choose whether to be accused of being a commie or a druggie. Which do you think sucks more? There's this lunatic named Lee Doo-hwan. His cousin is Lee Doo-sam. He used to smuggle with the UN Gang, and now he sells crank to Japan. Lee Doo-sam? Lee Doo-sam got released from Masan Prison because of pneumonia, and he's been missing ever since. - What about Choi Jin-pil? - Him? I heard he got out of the gang and is making a living as a merchant. Then let's catch Lee Doo-sam, Choi Jin-pil, and Jo Sung-gang first. Come on, Prosecutor Kim. Jo Sung-gang is a gang boss, after all. We can't get to him that easily. Let's just arrest a druggie who's addicted to crank. No, let's use this chance to lock up all the drug dealers along with the yakuza. I'll request an arrest warrant. Track down their locations first. What's wrong with him? How much money did you and Professor Baek embezzle? - You went to Japan with Jo Sung-gang? - I didn't embezzle money. We're going to expand to a new market. I told you not to work with gangsters! Then who should we work with? Churchmen? You must think you're so cool working with gangsters. Don't you know what will happen if things go wrong? What? Tell me. You ran off with your colleague's wife, so tell me. It seems like you enjoy stripping naked and waving your dick around, - but that will get you killed. - That mouth of yours... You punk. An arrest warrant was issued for me, you, and Jo Sung-gang. That prosecutor from Seoul is crazy about catching us. Tell Professor Baek not to act up and stay low. Or go ask Jo Sung-gang to save your ass. What a fucking idiot. Mr. Jo, it looks like they're determined to root out drug dealers. I'm taking off tonight. Please look after Doo-hwan. Okay. Go meet Mr. Koo in Yeouido, Seoul. That was America's best era. You could sleep with whites, blacks, Native Americans, Eskimos, whoever you wanted. Women were full of love then. The country was full of resistance, peace and love for humanity. And full of drugs too. The Qing dynasty fell because of opium, but the US seems to be doing just fine. Artists need drugs. In order to become a developed country, Korea should at least start legalizing marijuana. Don't you agree? Even grannies smoke marijuana when they take short breaks while farming in the countryside. This will get you high the quickest. Speed? Foreigners tend to like meditative stuff that calms the nerves. Compare this to the ones you get from America. So, you own a pharmaceutical company? I think you and I will be able to work together. Here. Did I finally surpass my master? I guess you won't need me anymore. Aren't you even going to try it? You've tried it before, right? The first ones the addicts afflict are their wives. And I hate that more than anything. Have a good life. Okay, let's begin. Cute, right? What? What's wrong with you? Hey. Is it that good? It's very good. Jung-ah Kim. She used to be a hostess at a famous bar in Seoul. She speaks Japanese, French, and English. So they bring her as an interpreter. What? Who does? Her boyfriends. Who are they? If you sleep with that woman, that's when you know that you've become a big shot. You know Chairman Jin, the Ginza Typhoon? Hey. Are you talking about the boss of all the bosses? That Chairman Jin? She's his adopted daughter. At least that's what they say. She's a real handful. Who's the guy next to her? Who's he? Oh, that's Director Hahm Chang-ho of the KCIA. He used to be the head of the Public Security Bureau. Some say he's Kim Jung-ah's lover, and some say he looks after her. Anyway, he's the number three in rank in the KCIA. That bastard. I'm Lee Hwan-soo. I see. Mr. Lee Hwan-soo. When are you free tomorrow? I'm busy tomorrow. But you'll still have to eat. Let's eat a meal together. I'll think of you every time I eat tomorrow, so let's just say we ate together. Goodness. What a nice house. So, you're in the trading business, right? Do you handle all the exports in Korea? I don't like red. There's this bar called American Bar in the Savoy Hotel in London. It's a lively bar with over 100 years of history. Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Grace Kelly... Tons of famous stars had visited that bar. Drinking a glass of champagne there makes you feel like you're back in time, drinking with them. - I wonder if you know how that feels. - Ms. Kim. Let's drop all the fancy talk and just start dating each other. Selon ta bourse gouverne ta bouche. You should live within your limits. That's the secret to longevity. I really hate men who have nothing but money. Regarding the upcoming election, it's going to require a lot of money, and we can never have enough resources. Mr. Lee insisted on helping out, so I'm introducing him to you out of pure patriotism. I was born in Manchuria, and our president has a great spirit since he's from there as well. I've earned enough money. If I could make one wish, it would be to meet the president in person and shake his hand. NAPOLI FOODS, LEE HWAN-SOO I'll become a loyal supporter of our president and nation. You export food to Japan? Just like what our president says, the only way for our country to grow is increasing exports. - You're a pillar of the industry. - I feel bashful. All right, then. Let's think about what you can do for the president and our nation. Look over here. Hey. - Good work. - Let's sit down. Gosh, it's great to be rich. I even get to ride on an airplane. Did you bring your stuff? What's the name of it? The name? Crank is just crank. Why would I name it? This is also a form of export, so it should have a brand name. A brand name? A brand name... Yes, that's right. TOKYO, JAPAN If you want to sell across Japan, you need to get through Chairman Jin. Even Yakuza graduate college and do legal business nowadays. They do a lot of charity work and support cultural assets. They're also in Mindan and the Central Intelligence Agency. They're involved with everyone that has power. The Japanese elite can't let anyone know that gangsters help them with the election. So they do this to deceive the public eye. You just need to make sure no one can say anything - about whatever bad deed you do. - Ready. WELCOMING EVENT FOR SOUTH KOREA'S NATIONAL WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM Papa. You're beautiful as always. Goodness, how pretty. Papa. This is CEO Lee Hwan-soo who recently became friends with me. He's chairman of the fundraising committee for the Korean athletes. Thank you for inviting me. It's an honor. Mr. Lee will be of great help to us. This was made by Korea's greatest craftsman. The statue's filled with drugs. Is the entire thing filled with it? I guess it is. Hey, scumbag. Look at how successful you've become by shipping saccharin. You're even wearing a suit. You can wear fancy clothes, but you can't hide your foul smell. Not everyone is allowed in here even if they're capable of paying for the meal. NAPOLI FOODS, LEE HWAN-SOO I've washed my hands clean, and I only do legal business now. I was reborn, you see. For a jerk like you to be reborn, he first needs to die for real. Maybe I should've buried you deep down under the sea that day. I think you and I need to have a long talk as we walk in the sea breeze. What's wrong? What's that jerk doing here? He used to be a KCIA inspector. Mr. Baek? Do you know him? That little piece of shit. He works at the embassy now. Doing what? What do you think? He catches commie spies. What's wrong? I don't really like him either. What do you say? Should we visit some Ginza bar girls? Fuck, I shouldn't have come. Did you meet Chairman Jin? Look at you. These days, you only deal with the big shots. That guy's political philosophy is completely different from ours. Cut the bullshit. What kind of a philosophy would a gangster have? We're still fighting the Korean War here. Then go ahead and fight with a spear in your hand. I don't care who's who as long as I get to sell my crank. That's how you guys are. You South Koreans have no loyalty. Stop talking like that. It's been ages since the division. So just cut the fucking crap. Why do you keep cursing? What's that bastard doing here? Damn that bastard. Who is he? The KCIA jerk working at the embassy. He's the jerk who threw me in jail back when I was a smuggler. That damned bastard. I know that punk very well. He claimed some Korean students in Japan formed a spy group. And he put my cousin on that list. My family got ruined because of him. Your family consists of yakuza, entertainers, and spies? You idiot. I'm living under someone else's name because of that asshole. That little scumbag. That fucking bastard is going to try to throw me in the sea. Fuck. Get out. Who's the jerk next to you? I want both of you to get out. You fucking bastard. Doo-sam. You even hang out with commies now? - Pull harder! - Damn it. You little... No! You fucker, leave me alone! Leave me the fuck alone! Why are you so obsessed with me? Fuck! What happened? Is he dead? That fucking bastard. We're blood brothers now. We'll live and die together. Do you understand? From now on, we're starting over with a group of people who haven't taken any bribes. No friends, family, or colleagues can know about this. And whatever we talk about here shall not be revealed to anyone. "Made in Korea." I got this from a Japanese cop. It's being distributed all over Japan under this name. But I got a tip saying it's being sold in Busan. It's not that I don't trust you. But this business can only be run when there is trust, faith, and loyalty between two parties. That's why I'm giving you this job. Here's your cut. Thank you. I'll see you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye. Goodness gracious. Jesus! What the fuck? Who are you? Wait. Hey! You fucking asshole. I'm sorry, sir. - Did you buy that house? - We've been living in a motel. Thanks to you, my firstborn was conceived in a motel. Her name is Jang-suk. - Jang-suk? - It means "long-term stay." "Long-term stay"? That's hilarious. You can pay me back by making this quick. You even deal drugs now? I was asked to deal. What kind of fool asked you to deal? Suh Sang-hoon. It was Suh Sang-hoon. Suh Sang-hoon? Suh Sang-hoon in the narcotics squad? He sells drugs? He offered to split the shares in half. He asked me... Where did Suh Sang-hoon get the drugs? His bribes are paid in drugs. Choi Jin-pil and Suh Sang-hoon used to be real close, but as soon as he found Choi Jin-pil useless, he sided with Lee Doo-sam. He gave me the leftover crank he got from Lee Doo-sam, saying I can earn some pocket money by selling them. So what else could I do? I mean, he calls it pocket money, but it's enough to buy a house. Wait. Lee Doo-sam? The guy who used to be the UN Gang's lackey? Goodness, Mr. Kim. Lee Doo-sam is no longer the Lee Doo-sam he used to be. He took over Japan and Busan. He's become the king of crank. Do you get it? He's improving our country's reputation. You know nothing. 1976, BUSAN Hey. Hey. You can keep eating. - Mun-ho, how will you - Yes, sir? gain strength by eating black bean noodles? Goodness. You sure are Chinese. You eat that stuff every single day. See you, Boss. You're eating that every time I come here. GOLDSTAR TELEVISION NEW VILLAGE MOVEMENT THE NEW VILLAGE MOVEMENT LEADERS' MEETING THE 1977 ANTI-COMMUNIST LEAGUE GENERAL MEETING Honey, help. Honey. What's wrong with you? You bastard. Did you think I wouldn't know, you jerk? - Doo-hwan. - Honey, please help. - You bitch! - I'm sorry. - Please don't do this. - Doo-hwan. - Tae-gu. - Doo-hwan. What's wrong with you? Don't come near me, you jerk! Doo-hwan, give me that knife. I know you're a good guy. Give me... - Don't come near me, you jerk! - Hey. INN Doo-hwan. What's going on with you? I told you to stay at the prayer house, didn't I? Why did you lock me up in there? Why? Do you know what they did to me? They beat me up every single day, you bastard. I'm sorry. How could you do that to me? I'm... I'm sorry. Fuck! Doo-sam! You fucker! Give me crank! Give me my share, you bastard! Doo-sam! Doo-sam, you fucking jerk! I guess someone needs to die for you to show up. You bastard! The dead guy is Doo-hwan's friend, right? It'll cost a lot to deal with the body. Okay. Give me my crank! Gosh. Doo-sam, you rotten bastard. I'm the one who got you this far. How dare you look down on me? How could you be so ungrateful? Mr. Jo, what do you mean "ungrateful"? I made a man out of a punk who used to drink another man's piss, and this is how you treat me? If you ever try to pull tricks again and plot things without me, you'll end up losing your head. I won't say it twice. When that happens, you'd better have two coffins ready for both you and your cousin. He apparently opened a clothing shop for her here. She used to be a hostess at the most famous bar in Seoul. What are you doing, Sook-kyung? You're going inside? Sook-kyung. Why would an educated woman like you volunteer to be a mistress? Doo-sam's greed is as dirty and enormous as the Busan coast. Will you be able to handle him? What did you just say? Didn't people mistake you with the late First Lady and bow to you on your way here? You bitch. What did you just say? How should I address you? Your husband isn't earning money in a respectable way. Don't try to act all noble in front of me. Just focus on raising your children. Marriage brought you no luck, but your kids might. You dirty whore. Do you want to go to jail for adultery? My gosh. Hey, lady! If I had been punished for adultery, I'd have already gotten a life sentence. So fuck you. "Fuck you"? You're no ordinary lunatic. You're damn right. Now that you've enjoyed watching this crazy bitch, you should go home. Doo-sam! Lee Doo-sam! Lee Doo-sam! Hey. Hey, I'm here. What's wrong? What is it? What... I am here. What's wrong? Now that things are going your way, have you no fear? What? Do you want me to teach you what you should be afraid of? All right, okay. Lower your voice. Let's go home. Home? You don't have a home anymore. Don't even dream of setting foot in my house ever again. I'm not going to raise my kids with a druggie anymore. I... No, you! You won't ever get to see your kids again. Why can't I see my own kids? Gosh, seriously. What's this? What happened? You've gone crazy. Do you even know what this is? What are you doing? You... - You! - What? The Lee Doo-sam I knew is gone. How could you screw up your life like this? Without me, you're nothing but a cheating druggie. You shouldn't be doing this to me! That greed of yours will end up ruining you. You reek of greed. That incredible money of yours also reeks of greed. That's going to get your life ruined. You'll end up falling in your own trap! Cut it out. Call the cops! Tell them to arrest this druggie! What... What's with you? Gosh, you've gone crazy! "Crazy"? Did you call me crazy? What is wrong with her? She's gone completely insane. What has gotten into her? She's completely lost it. Seriously. How's Director Hahm these days? Is he trustworthy? I don't keep useless people around me. We'll hear about the approval on our business in Hong Kong soon. Then I guess you'll cut me off as soon as I become useless to you. Right? So don't mess up. Quit the drugs. I'm not here to look after a local gangster. The higher-ups can only tolerate so much. Who's tolerating me? Do they think they won't stink of dirty money they received from me? That's right. They won't stink. They won't stink no matter how much money they take from you. But I've seen a lot of men get ruined by drugs. Goodness. How many druggies have you dated so far? You always do this. You can't have the world at your feet with this. Are you hiding something from me? What are you talking about? I'm sorry. Hey. Eat slowly. You'll get indigestion. Someone reported that a druggie who escaped from the hospital dined and dashed, so I went there. And he said something interesting. He says he's related to Lee Doo-sam, the Drug King. He's Lee Doo-hwan, Lee Doo-sam's cousin. I heard you chased after your ex-lovers every time you did drugs. It's funny how one of the main symptoms of crank abuse is the development of delusional jealousy of one's lover. I mean, why can't you trust the ones who are closest to you? In the end, you can't trust anyone including your siblings or parents. Right? You were quite famous at that hospital. I'm never going to go back there again. They don't want you back either. They're too scared of you. But you can go to jail. You can make a lot of friends there, so you won't be lonely. Goodness. Finish your soup. Gosh. Your cousin's really mean. I mean, I hear he is living an incredible life right now. His product is all over Busan and Japan. "Made in Korea," right? He dominated the world with that. No way. I'm the one who helped him do all that! Okay? Doo-hwan. So, is blood thicker than drugs or not? Sook-kyung. Where is Doo-sam? I'm starving to death right now. Doo-hwan. Who are you jerks? Hey, you asshole! Wait. Slow down. Wait. Hold on. Doo-hwan. Doo-hwan! Doo-hwan, what is this? Hey, you punk! Who are you, you asshole? Doo-hwan! Lee Hwan-soo. No. You are Lee Doo-sam. RESIDENT REGISTER: LEE DOO-SAM Your wife ended up marrying the same man twice. What kind of karma led you to cook crank at night and promote rural and domestic development by day? Lee Doo-sam is your real name, right? Where's your hometown? - Manchuria. - Manchuria. No wonder you've got so much spirit. I heard you paid Suh Sang-hoon a grand sum of money. Prosecutor, where's your hometown? Listen, Mr. Lee. I'm angrier at the government workers who feed off you than I am at you and the gangsters who work with you. So are you saying you're going to catch the ones who feed off me? You don't have the guts. Listen, you fucking bastard. I admit that you're one of a kind. You both work in factories, but do you know how much those factory girls make in a day while taking drugs and working around the clock? They earn 600 won. On the other hand, a single batch earns you a billion won. Goodness. And your crank's called "Made in Korea"? You think you're some kind of patriot? Where do you even spend all that filthy money? I get how you became the director of the KFCC. But you're also the director of the Busan National Development Council. "The chairman of Korea Women's Volleyball Association." "The advisor of Korea's Anti-Communist League." "The Schubert Society of Korea." Is this the Schubert that I know of, you little jerk? Sir. You want to know where I spend my filthy money? I don't spend it like a powerful man, but I spend it on the powerful men. If I gave you a bag... filled with 100 million won, what would you do? I'll keep it a secret, okay? Goodness, did you just see that? Something just crossed your mind. Something... But it's nothing to be ashamed of, you know. I heard you're doomed if you do your own drugs. Why are you digging your own grave? I heard you see angels and devils coming down from the sky if you do crank. Which one is on your side? Which one of them do you think will stab you in the back? Your cousin sold you out. Aren't you worried that your wife might cheat on you as well? See? You've got all the money in the world, but you're always anxious because you know you'll get caught one day. And today is the day. Find a person who will bring you food to prison because I will get your wife locked up too. You little bastard. Do you want to die? How dare you lay your filthy hands on me? Hey, listen. I'm an honorable prosecutor of this country, you bastard. - Fuck. - You scumbag. - You asshole. - Did you just block? You piece of shit. You bastard. Do you want to die, you fucker? Gosh, I can't stand him anymore. Damn... That little... The district attorney wants us to let him go. Fuck! Why? Hey, Made in Korea. A druggie has better connections than a prosecutor. I'm impressed. You crazy bastard. Let's go. You asshole, get back here. Hey! Hey! Jung-ah, is that you? My goodness. No wonder. I was wondering how a druggie had better connections than me. But I get it now. What happened? Why would the famous Kim Jung-ah come all the way to the countryside to clean up after some druggie? If you want to catch someone with no connections, catch a commie. How'd your life become such a ruin? A truly beautiful flower stays beautiful even when it withers. Don't you agree? I should also try to win your favor. I didn't know you still have this much power. Doo-sam. Druggie. Do you think this connection of yours will last forever? Think carefully about who's really on your side. I told you to be careful. Do you know how hard it was for me to keep your wife and sister safe? Let your cousin go to jail. I can only do so much. Why? Just go suck up to that prosecutor. What? Why would I humiliate myself by begging to a nobody like him? It seems like you two are pretty close. You men and your bloated egos... What are you saying? Do you think you got me out? It was my bribes that got me out. How dare you act like you did everything? What? Don't you... glare at me. Are you out of your mind? Are you seriously saying that in this situation? Is your brain working properly? Do you think it is easy to get a druggie like you out of there? You bitch. Look at you showing your true colors now. How dare you treat me with no respect? You fucking bitch. Gosh, what's this smell? Has a fish gone bad or something? Get your stinky ass out of here. - I will! - Get out right now! Boss, Kim Soon Pyung is in Busan. Soon Pyung is? He killed a mid-level boss over in Japan, so a lot of people are after him. Doo-sam, help me out. I escaped to Busan to save myself. But jerks at the KCIA are after me. I heard one of the guys who was there that night told them what happened. I don't know what you mean. I'll get stabbed to death if I go back to Osaka. I think I'm destined to live in my homeland. My parents always talked about Jeju Island, so I'll go there and raise horses. Please help me. I'll get you a boat. Go back. If you don't help me, who will? We're blood brothers. Will you please leave me alone? I am in deep shit myself, you fucker. I've been upset with you for a while, but I've been holding it in. What do you think I will do if you treat me like this? What do you think? Do you know how I feel right now? I feel like I'm thrown into the open sea. You're my lighthouse now. I will entrust my life to you. You'll do well. I have one request. Based on President Park's ideology, we pledge to strengthen the unity of our nation, preserve our national traditions, and dedicate our lives and loyalty to our nation and its people. And in order to defeat the nefarious schemes of North Korea, we will bring the people together and do our best in our positions to fortify our nation's security apparatus. Goodness. Gosh. Because of the New Village Movement, no one's able to sleep. Why are you drinking without any food? That's not good for your health. Gosh, that's enough. Mr. Kim. His friend used to be a member of the Sunggang Gang, and someone asked him to sell some crank. But apparently, the guy who asked was a yakuza from Japan. He's a Korean-Japanese who worked with Lee Doo-Sam when he made his first export to Osaka. And I heard he's in Busan right now. He caused trouble in Osaka and stowed away to Busan. He's in need of money, so he sells crank. What a sad life. Down with the Yushin regime! Down with the Yushin regime! Abolish the dictatorship and the Yushin regime! Down with the Yushin regime! Abolish the dictatorship and the Yushin regime! Down with the Yushin regime! Abolish the dictatorship! Abolish the dictatorship and the Yushin regime! No more political repression! No more political repression! Go ahead. What are you doing, you jerk? You bastard! You jerk! What are you doing? Kill him! Hello? How are things in Seoul? I think I should go there. Don't you watch the news? The country's falling apart. Show some concern for this country! These so-called big shots don't care about the country at all. President Park has declared martial law over Busan in accordance with Article 54 of the Constitution in response to the student protests that have overtaken the city. Therefore, Busan... No more political repression! Damn it! Last night, at around 7:50 p.m., President Park Chung-hee was shot in the dining hall on the Blue House grounds by Kim Jae-gyu, the director of KCIA, and passed away at the age of 62. As per President Park's will and according to Article 48 of the Constitution, Prime Minister Choi Kyu-ha will be taking on the presidential duties. The government has declared martial law all over the country except for Jeju Island as of 4:00 a.m. on October 27. And this afternoon, Choi Kyu-ha... CHIEF LEE, PROSECUTOR HA... Hello, may I talk to Chief Huh? Hello, is Chief Jo there by any chance? Tell him I'm the guy from Busan. THE PLAZA HOTEL, SEOUL No, wait. Then is Director Lee Jae-sung there? Is the district attorney there? I'm his friend from Busan. Hey, Mr. Koo. It's me. What's going on? No one's answering my calls. Did they all flee? Then what about me? What's going to happen to me? Just stay low and see how things turn out. And don't call me, okay? Mr. Koo. As President Park's funeral procession passes by Gwanghwamun and enters Sejongno intersection, endless lamentation... Those bastards. Why did they have to fire guns after taking my money? A layer of fog blankets the city as if the skies are also in sorrow. Many citizens pound the ground in grief as they cry out loud about the vanity of our late president's death. I was trying to live a decent life. I've been a good person. Those little bastards... I'm going to kill those bastards. I'll fucking kill them all. 1980, BUSAN Hey, come over here. Hey, it's me. Did I get any calls? Listen to me carefully. There are people who are after me. Kim Il Sung sent armed commies to get me. Kim Shin Jo crossed the 38th parallel and climbed over the walls of the Blue house to get me. I'm serious. Right now... Let me talk to Jung-soo. Hurry. Hey, why isn't he answering when his dad's asking for him? Come on. You know me, right? I devoted my entire life to this country's modernization. You know I received a medal from the president, right? That's who I am. This country needs me. I earned money for everyone. You all would have starved to death without me. So don't get any ideas and make sure... you take good care of... our kids. Sook-kyung. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, you bitch. I'll kill you if you betray me. I'm going to kill all those bastards who are after me. Okay? I'm the famous Lee Doo-sam. Who... Who's calling my name? I'm Lee Doo-sam. Who's calling me? Hey! I'm Lee Doo-sam. What do you want? Show yourself! Don't hide! You bastards. I'm Lee Doo-sam... Why are you hiding? I'm right here! Lee Doo-sam is right here! Look. There's a CCTV here. Is this the KCIA headquarters or what? What was that? You commies! You'd better not come any closer. He has a gun. Do we have guns? No, we don't. I'm going to shoot you all, you bastards. I think we need guns. Those bastards. I'll kill them all. See? Come on! I told you they'd cross the 38th parallel to get me. What did I tell you? I was right. We protect This beautiful land We live today With vigor We will risk our lives Going through the fires of war And fight for the peace On our homeland and in our families I will fight To protect our nation Come on out, you commies! I'll shoot every single one of you! Lee Doo-sam. Put that gun down. Who are you? Are you Kim Il Sung? I'm Prosecutor Kim In-gu. A prosecutor? Fuck. I brought... I brought a lot of bullets. Where... - I don't have any. - It's over. Put the gun down. Are you here to kill me? No. Don't get worked up. Think of your family. Drop the gun. Drop the gun! I no longer want to get stomped on. Mr. Lee. I got shot, you see... I got shot right here. Goodness. What... How do you feel? Why didn't you run? Why would I run? Gosh. Kim Jung-ah got taken in by the Security Bureau. She's in a mess. Mr. Lee. The world has changed. Let's wipe the slate clean. What? Oh, well... You should become a prosecutor who chases after the real bad guys. Catching a guy like me won't change anything. I mean, well... I was just trying to help people make a living. And let's be honest. Do you know how many people made a living off me? You can't deny it. I swear this on my job. If you don't cooperate, I'll make sure you rot and die in prison. It's time for you to wake up to reality, Mr. Lee. ACCOUNT BOOK PROSECUTOR CHOI, DEPUTY CHIEF JUNG OF ANTI-SMUGGLING SQUAD...
