A Film by Dorit Hakim Moon in the 12th House Mira! Mira! Mira! Mira! Good morning. - Good morning. Are you okay? Too hot? Then open up. Dad, please open up. Good. Dad, open your mouth. Open up. Mr. Shoshani, why are you worrying your daughter? What's with the act? Mr. Shoshani, I know you understand me, so what's this about? Do you want a feeding tube? He'll finish the porridge, you'll see. When? It's almost dinner time. Are you his only family? Dad, my hand. Dad, my hand. Dad, let go of my hand. Dad, please let go of my hand. Dad, you're hurting me! Let go of my hand! Mira! Mira... Mira, we were here yesterday. Let them in. The four of us... Dude, we're with them. - Invites only. Hey, we're with them. You heard me. It's a private party, - You bitch! What is this? I've been waiting two hours! Mira... Two. That girl is calling you. Yes, sweetie? - Mira, let her in. My pleasure. Let her in. Carlo. Shut the door. I'm going to the bathroom. What's going on? - Nothing. I need a break. Already? Yes, my feet are killing me. - How many? Nice. How many freebies? Just that loser of yours. You had to leave her hanging, eh? You couldn't help yourself. Who is she? Just some journalist. A 16-year-old journalist? Seriously? She has a nightlife blog. What do you want? Stop acting stupid. I just... remember how you hung out here, when you were 16, with your little black skirt and no panties. When I was 16, you didn't own the club. Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Wait... Turn it off. - Hold on. It's stuck in my ass. Who is it? No one. What are you doing? Let go. Give me that. Whose number is this? - I don't know. Get off my tits. Who is it? - Give it back! It's no one. Then I'll answer it. It's my sister, okay? Your sister? Since when do you have a sister? Mira? What? It's me, Lenny. I know. What's going on? How are you? I'm fine. What's the matter? Dad is in the hospital. Is that why you're calling? Yes. Well, I don't care. He had a stroke. He's been there for a month. I didn't call you, because I thought he'd be out much sooner, but... he's not doing well. Lenny, speak up. I can't hear you. Will you come see him? Mira? Lenny, it's really noisy here. I can't hear you, okay? I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye. Fuck you. What? Why is it that I don't know anything about you? What's to know? I thought you don't have any family. I don't. I have a sister. That's all. I want to know everything about you: what kind of sandwiches they made you for school, what poster you had on your bedroom wall, what you wanted to be when you grow up. That's the Molly talking, huh? Let go. Carlo is probably freaking out. It's from my mom. There's money for food and gas. It's a lot of money. - It's a lot of time. She said it's a week. One week, two weeks. She went to open an exhibition... in Japan. How long would that take? Not a week. What's your name? Lenny. Ben. It's inside out. Who cares? I forgot something. Do you need to go home? There's no reason to be afraid of me. Here. Take this form... Make sure he takes his meds, okay? - Okay, thank you. Happy holiday. Thanks. - Happy holiday. Bye. Where did everybody go? - Home. It's a holiday. Remember? Didn't anybody tell you? - No. Then can I take my father too? - Yes, but what will you do with him? He needs round-the-clock care. - So? So, you have to know how to take care of him. You're all on your own. How will you manage? Wait. I'm taking him. - I see that. Wait a minute. You may not have these at home. You slip them on like underwear. Okay? Mr. Shoshani, happy holiday. - Happy holiday. Lenny? Sorry. I'm good. Then why did you drag me in here? For this. Not now, Mira. I don't want any problems at the door. Okay... This is not a good time. Come on. You saw what's going on out there. The cops are just waiting to nail us. Go on. Head back downstairs. Give this to Carlo. He's been driving me crazy. My ass is getting bigger... because I'm pregnant, Doron. So? I don't know... Did you do it on purpose? No. Then what's this about? Nothing. I thought we might consider it this time. Consider it, Mira? You're freaking me out. Don't you want a child with me? No. Why? - Because. I want us to have something that just belongs to the two of us. We have that already. This club is our baby. We'll have more like this too. We're going to make it big. We're a winning team. I'm not whore and I don't have any drugs. Get lost. Stop. Why? Stop, Mira. I didn't do anything. I didn't say you did. I told you to stop. Fuck you! - Stop! What's wrong with you, freak? Do you want to die? Give me your bag. Let go of my hand! - Fine. Get in! - I'm getting in. You said you'd let me go, right? I told you everything. Now let me go. How will I know you're not gonna call and warn him? Trust me. I don't trust girls like you. You're such a shit, you know? - You'd better cool it. You said you'd let me go! My men will go in and make the arrests. Then you can go, okay? â€œWhere are you???! We got busted. Call Yossi the lawyer." Dad, I'm going to check the gas. Dad, what happened? It's okay, Dad. You're okay. Dad, you'll be fine. That's enough. Come. Let's get you up. Come on. Come on. Hey! Looking for someone? Is Lenny home? Across the street. What's over there? - My house. She'll be right back. Want to come in? No. What are you doing here? I came. Are you alone? Yes. May I come in? Wow. Some place you have here. May I? I'm starving. I haven't eaten since morning. Why? Did something happen? No, I just forgot. How can you forget to eat? It's a habit I have. Did you see Dad? No, I didn't go in. How is he? Not good. But he's home, so he must be doing better, right? It's just a visit. It's amazing how you look exactly the same. You know what would look good on you? What? Keratin treatment. It'll make your hair look amazing. It'll make all your split ends disappear. I can do it for you, if you want. Is everything okay? Yes, of course. You got into trouble... - No! What's your problem? You've been looking at me funny ever since I got here. It's just that you said you'd call. So I came instead. That's better, isn't it? Yes. All I'm saying is that it was so long ago... Never mind. Let's go. Let's stay. We'll talk. About what? I don't know... Fill me in on what's been going on... Later. Dad is waiting. Do you think it's okay if... I show up like this all of a sudden? Yes. Why not? I don't know. He might have another stroke. You know what? I... I'll come some other time. It's for the best. But you're already here. So what? At least I got to see you. That's all that matters. Mira! Mira, you don't have to sleep in our house. I'll talk to Ben, my neighbor. You can sleep there. His mother is overseas. How much longer? Patience. I have to calculate the houses. What's there to calculate? It's just a superstition. Do you know how many tycoons won't budge without their astrologist? Astrology is a science, sweetie. I've been studying it for two years. You know what? Enough talk. In a second I'll read you like an open book. So how's my sister? You're really sisters? Why? Who did she say I am? - No one. Then why won't you go into your own house? What's with all the questions? Did Lenny tell you to ask me that? No, just wondering. I mean, if it's your house... Because I haven't been here for a few years. Why? Had a fight? No, it just didn't work out. But you live in Tel Aviv. What didn't work out? That's what's so messed up. Everything is 90 minutes from Tel Aviv. Give me a drag. She really never told you about me? Whatever. Lenny is like water. You put her in a flask, and she assumes its shape. Do you know why? Why? Because her moon is in the 12th house. What does that mean? Bad karma. Forget it. Okay, let's see what comes up for you. Whoa! You're one lucky kid! You kept my poster. I like her hair. It's a bit short, don't you think? You can sleep in my bed. I'll take Dad's. No way! It smells of pee. No, it doesn't. It doesn't? I replaced my mattress with yours. Ewww, that's gross. I had to. Mine stank of pee. You don't believe me? I believe you replaced it. I don't know if you stopped. Idiot. Hey, Lenny... What? Let's sleep head to toes. Just until I fall asleep. Don't be mean. It was so sad to see you struggle with the sheet: rinsing it, drying it... Then you'd get into my bed, and your feet were ice cold. I felt so bad for you. You could have helped me, instead of pretending to be asleep. What do you want? Things were shitty. That's what it's like when it's shit. - You're exaggerating. Happy kids don't wet their beds. Will you come with me to see Dad tomorrow, Mira? It's important. Okay. Mira? - Just a minute. Aren't you ready yet? I woke up a mess. I'm exhausted. I'll make you some coffee while you get ready. You have five minutes. Wait, Lenny. I don't feel well. My head is splitting. Take some Advil. It's in the cabinet. - Stop pressuring me, okay? Lenny, come on! I really don't feel well. Fine. I just waited for nothing. You could have just said that you don't want to come. It's not that I don't want to. I... What? I need time. It's not as easy for me as it is for you. Easy? He barely knows who I am, you idiot. Got any cigarettes? Cigarettes. Have any? No. Want to come with me to buy some? Okay. Come on. Get up already. Go in and get me some. What do you think I am? I don't feel like talking to people- Do me a favor. Mira? Mira? Oh my God... What's up? How many years has it been? At least a hundred. Who's counting? - Me. Hey, you look amazing! - Thanks. So... what are you up to? Nothing. What have you been doing? - Nothing much. The usual. Okay then. I'm sure I'll see you. I'm here for a few days, so... I'll see you. How's your dad? I hear that... he won't fully recover. Say, do you have anything to smoke? Yes, I do. Come by tonight. We'll smoke together. You have nothing on you, Arnon? I'm suffocating in this dump. Why a dump? Did you see how it's grown? Did you see the mansions people are building? What about you? - What about us? Selling your house. Prices are sky high. I can get you an amazing price. Oh, yeah? Of course. Okay, but first give me something to smoke. Okay, I have... a little something in the ashtray. I'll get it for you. Want anything else? "Dirty Dancing - Doron Tal, owner of the 'New Limit' club "is drug lord of the Tel Aviv scene." See you tonight. Hey. Are you mad at me? No. Then can we talk? About what? How's Dad? What do you care? I thought you said we can talk. I met Arnon today. He says we can get a great price for the house. It's Dad's house. You realize he's in no shape. You have no idea what shape he's in. You told me he barely recognizes you. So you want to sell his house? I think we have to start thinking about our future, yes. Is that why you came? We have a chance to start over. We have a chance to start over. We can do all sorts of things with the money. I don't understand how you can even think about it. Don't you want a life of your own? - No. Maybe go on a big trip? No. School? - I don't know. I'm not thinking about that now. Mira? What are you doing? Getting rid of all the ugly stuff in here. I'm not selling the house. What did you do with the curtains? Did you go through her stuff? You stuck my stuff in the attic, but hers he kept. Why is he still keeping all of it? Okay, give me a hand here. What did you throw in here? Her clothes, her cheap cosmetics, and her meds. A million stinking pills. I can still smell them. Can't you smell them? - No. Fucking shit! Shit! It's no big deal. I'm going crazy, I can't get rid of that smell. How can you not smell it? I don't know. I don't smell anything. You have to see what I found in the attic. You never even opened it. Do you remember when I bought it for you? Then why did you throw it out? I didn't throw it out. You don't have to lie anymore. What did you want me to do? I didn't want her to know that I see you, so I hid it in the attic. That bitch! Ever think what might have been if Dad never married her? Only once? You wouldn't have gone to boarding school. We wouldn't have had to meet in secret. I still hate her. She was a whore. That's what she was. Do you think I could be a mother? What do you mean? Anybody can. I mean me. Yes, I think so. Tell me the truth. Yeah, why not? Will you help me? Are you pregnant? I was supposed to have an abortion but I didn't go. I have no idea why I didn't. What am I going to do now? It will be all right. If it's a girl, will you name her after Mom? Mira? Mira? I'm over here! Where? Here. I'm peeing. You're unreal. - I can't hold it in. What can I do? "Lenny and Mira" You don't name a child after someone who died young. Why not? Because it's bad luck. If I ever have a girl, I'll call her Dina. What are you doing? Watering the other one. How can you go from Mom's grave to the grave of that bitch? I can. This... Does it remind you of anything? That I fell off my bike? That you fell off your bike? - Yes. - Yes? Yes. - How did you fall? I don't remember. I rode over a rock. I don't remember. I rode over a rock. You don't remember because you're lying. - I'm not lying. What do you want? - I want you to tell the truth. Why did you never say anything bad about her? Why did you never say anything bad about her? Why was it only me? Why? Well? Answer me! I didn't want to get sent to boarding school like you! That's the truth. Lenny! Come! Lenny, come. Want some coffee? - No, thanks. Want some coffee? - No, thanks. You swim every day? You're a classic Cancer. Are you really an astrologist? - Yes. Do you want me to do your chart? Do you want me to do your chart? I don't believe in that nonsense. - It's not nonsense at all. Right now, Mercury is in retrograde. - What does that mean? It means that... you mustn't start new things. You mustn't start new things. You mustn't make any changes, moves, anything. Does that mean you're staying? Looks like it. Don't you have to go back to work? Don't you have to go back to work? I quit. Why? I don't want to do it anymore. It was fun at first, but not anymore. You know how it is. Everyone is stoned. They're all into themselves. They're all into themselves. It's not what it used to be, you know? I've never been to a club. What? No way. I'm shocked. Not even around here? - Hey, I have to go. Not even around here? - Hey, I have to go. Okay. Let me help you. Okay, then... I'm here. I'm here. Bye. - Bye. Dad? Dad? Dad? I have to go, because... I have to go, because... Mira is back. She showed up all of a sudden. I thought it would be nice if she came to see you with me. What do you say? Who is Mira talking to? I don't know. Lenny? Come over here! Come. I don't drink this stuff. I don't drink this stuff. You shouldn't either. Relax, it's mostly juice. -It doesn't taste like alcohol. Try it. Go on. See that guy over there? See that guy over there? He said you're pretty. He says that about everyone. You know him? No. So why would you say that? - Because he's a loser. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. Besides, his brother has a bar on the kibbutz. He said he might have a job for me. A job? Just for the time being, until... I thought you said you had it with nightlife. Weekdays are a bit slow. I need to give the place a real buzz. Weekdays are a bit slow. I need to give the place a real buzz. People, new lineups... She'll be great! Why are you so worried. - Don't worry. I know the job inside out. Hey, what's up? Come on in. Come sit with us. Gur. Yanai. My sister Lenny. How's it going? What are the photo albums doing here? They didn't believe I'm from here, so I showed them pictures. You know, proof. Pictures... Maybe one. We've met before, haven't we? I don't think so. Okay, then... we're outta here. Okay. Thanks for the beer. - My pleasure. If you want, we can start over. - What do you mean? Have a beer with me? The peanuts are on me. Give her a chaser, and she's yours. Whatever you say. Excellent. - Excellent. Then I'll see you. I see that he has a powerful presence in your chart. Oh, yeah? Didn't you say Mercury is in retrograde. - It's over. Wow! Face me. Relax your lips. What is that? It feels weird. - You feel a tingle? Awesome. Drink this. How about coming with me? It won't be much of a date if I come with you. Drink it. - I don't like it. Just a sip. It'll loosen you up. Mira, don't. - She'll never know. She has stacks of them in here. Please... Take it off! What about this? No. Whoa! This is perfect. Let me take care of him. What? I need Lenny. Just a second, okay? What are you doing? I told you. We're using the blow dryer. - How much longer? A few minutes. Okay. Tell her I need her. - Okay. Go on. Tell her. Bye! What does he want? - Forget about him. I can pick out guys like him in a second. What kind of guys? Cry babies. Is your baby's father also a cry baby? My baby's father is an asshole. We don't talk about him. What did he do to you? - We don't talk about him. Do you love him? Love is not enough. What does that mean? - It's perfect with this bra. Now smile. Do you think I'll have fun? Of course. You'll have the best time ever. Just be yourself. Guys love the silent type. Cheers. - Cheers. So what do you think about the place? It's nice. - I know, right? Hey, bro, how's it going? I think so too. My brother poured his soul into this place. I love this track. Do you know it? I'll be right back. Okay. Lenny? I hardly recognized you. You look incredible. Give us a twirl. You're so hot! Is that from "Zara?" Yes, "Zara." You wearing one earring on purpose? - Of course. What are you drinking? Is it any good? Are you alone here? Yeah, who are you here with? Mira? I saw her around the village. She hasn't changed a bit! Is that Yanai? Yeah, it's Yanai. I'll be right back. Back already? How did it go? Fine. Where's Gur? Did something happen? Are you interrogating me? I'm just asking. Lenny! Lenny, what happened? Let me pee in peace. Can you please tell me what happened? - Nothing happened. Was he all over you? Is that why you bailed? What don't you understand? Nothing happened! Nothing! If that's how you were on your date, no wonder you're home so early. I didn't even want this. You did, just like always. Excuse me? Now you're blaming me? What are you even doing here? - Watching a movie. I got bored on my own. I want you to leave. Lenny, calm down. I'm trying to help you. You're not helping me. You're just making things worse. Why did you even come here? To ruin everything again? Haven't you done enough? Could you please calm down? So you had one bad date. It's not the end of the world. It has nothing to do with the date. I don't want to see you anymore. You were always ungrateful. Hey. Where are you? At my sister's. Why don't you answer your phone? I lost it. How could you do that to me? I needed time to think. - To think? They shut us down, you psycho! Why are you shouting at me? - What did you tell them? I didn't tell them anything. What did you tell them? Nothing. I don't believe you. I swear. It you didn't tell them anything, then why aren't you here? Ben? Get up. A few more minutes. You're late for school. School is for losers. Dear passengers, the train to Haifa will leave from platform 1. Have a nice journey. Stop! Let me down. I want to go home. Come on! I want to go home. It's late already. Stop. Let me down. I want to go home. Let me down! - One last game and then home. Ready or not, here I come. I don't believe in the stars. Why not? I have something else. What? Sneezing. Sneezing? - Don't you know it? You stare at the sun until you sneeze, and then you make a wish. I was addicted to it, when I was little. Did it work? No. No? Why not? She never came back. Who? Mira. I bet you miss your mom. - You think so? I can't stand her. That will pass. You don't really know her. She just pretends to be a good mom... so people will help her. When we lived in Tel Aviv, one neighbor brought me food, and another one took me to school. Seriously? I swear. And she had this ex, who used to play FIFA with me. I'm pretty sure she paid him. - No way. You're exaggerating. Not at all. All she cares about is her art. I love this song. It reminds me of what it used to be like here. "Will you hear my voice, "my far-away one? "Will you hear my voice..." You have a nice voice. You should have gone to graduation. I don't want to go anywhere. I just want to be with you. Who is that? Are you Mira's sister? Nice to meet you. I'm Doron. Mira isn't here. Where is she? I don't know. When is she coming back? I don't know. You don't know? I don't know. She was here, but she left. Did she go with anyone? No. You know you two look so much alike? You both hold your elbow when you're lying. Listen, she's not here. Do with it what you want. You have a brother too? Pretty soon I'll find out you have a mom, a dad, a grandma, and a dog. Well? What? Where is she? I really don't know. Okay. I'll wait here for her. Call me any time, okay? Come here. What are you doing here? Close the door, I don't want him to hear us. I knew right away that there was something going on with you two. That's not true at all. Stop it. I know what I saw. Fine. Don't you realize you have a problem? - I have a problem? You're fucking a 14-year-old, damn it! - He's 16 and a half. 16! 14! What difference does it make? He's a child. Do you have anything else to say? I'm not blaming you, okay? You're stuck in this dump and... I didn't realize that I should have gotten you out of here long ago. What makes you think I'd go with you? Okay, bye. I spoke to her boyfriend. He's on his way. What? You called him? I thought you wanted her to leave. She's my sister, Ben. No! Mira! Mira! Mira! Doron is on his way here. I didn't mean for her to die. I'm sorry. He came looking for you. He really doesn't look very nice. I know that everything you went through was because of me. Don't do anything stupid. Ben just called him. I just wanted to stop your suffering. I didn't think that would happen. I didn't. She could have had a seizure. I shouldn't have left her alone. She died because of both of us. We were kids. You were 15. That's a child. I just wanted to free you from her. That's all. Then why didn't you come back? Why did you leave me alone with Dad? I waited for you every day... for I don't know how long! I'd run to the bench every day after school, hoping that you'd come back, and everything would be the way it was, just the two of us and Dad. That's what you wanted, wasn't it? I couldn't. He would have forgiven you. But I couldn't forgive him. I couldn't forgive him for not protecting us from her. Doron is here. It's nice here. Idyllic... like you. Like me? You're also a bit... idyllic inside, aren't you? I gave it a lot of thought... I realized that... I shouldn't have blamed you for what happened at the club. Is that what you realized? I'm sorry. I want you to come home. Stop. It's over. We both know that. Tell me what you want me to say and I will. There's nothing to say. Will you tell Dad about the baby? I had an abortion. There is no baby. What does "a moon in the 12th house" mean? It's... people who... lock what they long for deep down inside and think that it will simply disappear. People who bury the child they were, because they hate him... like me. I have a moon in the 12th house too. Translation: Tammy King and Danny Wool Subtitles: Cinematyp Studios Ltd.
