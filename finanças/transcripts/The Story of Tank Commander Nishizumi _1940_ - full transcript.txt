Sponsored by Japanese Culture Central Association Celebration of Imperial Era 2600 Work of Art Festival Shochiku Oofune Eiga (Cinema) Supported by the Department of War Through the personality of Tank Commander Nishizumi, I try to describe the spirit of our tank officers and men as well as the actual circumstances under which the tank fighters were facing during the Sino-Japanese Incident. If the movie could urge the recognition of the importance of mechanization in the Army I am especially pleased. Imperial Era 2600 By Yoshimura Kozabura For the memorial festival of the lmperial Era 2600. this movie is respectfully dedicated to the souls of the war dead who protected Japan.

The place where Captain Nishizumi Kojiro was born is Kosa-machi, Kamimashiki-gun Kumamoto prefecture. The area of Higo including his birth place had been well-known for a number of royalist samurai since ancient times. The sincere spirits of those ancestors were rooted in the mind of local peoples long and deeply. that created the simple and bold Higo-damashii spirit. We can easily guess that, the captain who was born in the place and became a human in the place, must have been influenced by those traditional spirits. The house in which the captain was born is located remote from town. It was so called Soto-mura (exterior village). Father was Sansaku, mother was Chiyo. The captain was born as the second son of the parents. His father Mr. Sansaku was retired soldier who joined Taiwan Expedition and Russo-Japanese War. Considering his father's background he must have been motivated to become a soldier since childhood. Midorikawa river, which was located nearby his house, was an ancient battlefield of Seinan-no-eki. It is said that the river, the old battlefield, was captain's most favorite playing place as child. After graduated the local elementary school, he went to a junior high school in a town called Mifune. In the school garden of the junior high school, there was a monument, On the monument, a writing of two words Ko Chu (duty to lord and parents) by Miyabe Teizo, who was a royalist samurai as well as his senior in hometown, was engraved. That was the principle of the education of the school under which the captain was educated. Showa 5 (1930). April, he entered the Military Academy when he was 17 years old. He was born in January therefore he was the youngest in the class. But his classmates told that his ganbarism (do-my best-spirit) was number one in the class. Showa 12 (1937), July, when Sino-Japanese Incident broke out at Marco polo Bridge in north China. He was as young as 24 years old . serving as a lieutenant of the army infantry in the first tank regiment. When the war fire spread into Shanghai, he finally took the field as shotaicho (platoon commander) of Takanashi squadron of Hosoki regiment. The situation of Shanghai area was, the Navy Land Forces furiously fighting in town and, the Dispatched Amy completed the risky landing in the face of the enemy. The enemy built the careful encampment and fought back desperately, the fierce battle around Kowanchin (Jiangwan) continued. Takaori Regiment Headquarters Message! Medical soldier!

Do you think you are cooking good? Yes sir. We are working hard for the win of first battle. We can't fight well with empty stomach. Napoleon said an army fights with stomach. Napoleon said so? Yesterday, shotaicho-dono got off the tank in front of the enemy and went scouting the creek alone for crossing river. Yes I did. We are amazed your braveness. It's not braveness but duty. But you stopped a soldier who tried to do so and you went. We are very moved. I rushed out because nobody but me could know how to do. It is not worth to be impressed. ls it true? These are arrived sir. Rare. How grateful sir. One more. Today's supper will be gorgeous. now, the first battle, Hozanjo castle, Now moving is Takanashi squadron. Good. Don't come out. It's dangerous. I will go to check the creek if we can cross or not. You must go back. I will go sir. No, you can't understand yet. Go back. Order! Shotaicho-dono! What? Arakawa is. Where was shot? Belly sir. No good. Moriyama give him bandage. Arakawa, can you hear? I am shotaicho. Can you hear me? I told you not go out. You fool. Shotaicho-dono. Hold on. Not serious injury. Hold on. hold on. Signal of rush. Can you hear, Arakawa? Our tanks destroyed barbed-wire entanglements, now we are rushing through the path. Can you hear that? Yes, I can hear sir. Can you hear, Arakawa? Arakawa? The main forces in Shanghai battle which was led by Chiang Kai-Shek, was said 500,000 in front and it reached 800,000 with the rear forces. In a battlefield as small as 20 km between Woosung and Suzhou River, there were a number of tochka and base of machine guns installed. They used forests, bamboo groves, local houses, graves and so on for their positioning, and installed all of the modern weapons. With them, they resisted desperately. Therefore our army had to use huge amount of energy and sacrifice many victims even to capture single village or so. For example, in the tank squadron to which Lieutenant Nishizumi belonging to, Takanashi chutaicho was injured on the head in the battle of Shukataku, he was hospitalized and replaced with Lieutenant Nishizumi, who led the squadron since then. He destroyed the enemy in Hokataku, Geppochin, Kokyo, Fukurikyo, Nanso, Bakyo, Senkatakuto he kept to move to Ratenchin, where he faced the enemy so-called White Wall House Enemy for 24 days, they now are going to contact with the first front in the north. Look. You must check this map so that you will not be lost even if I died. This is the road we are running now. This is the creek of Maruto. This is Ratenchin. The purpose of scouting today is, to find a possible way to Ratenchin. I hope this bridge not fallen, but maybe it did. What's happening, Fujitaki? We are hit sir. Damn. From where did they shoot? Let's walk from here. Yes sir. What to do with the car sir? You can leave it. Take the key. Yes sir. Let's go. Ready? No! Wait! What are you doing? Danger. Come back. See? Stupid. Come, quick. Listen, I will check if there is the bridge or not. Wait here. Let me do it sir. Shotaicho. Wait. Just wait. Hey, dangerous! Hey, we move there. Head is too high. They returned. What happened? Nothing. Don't scare me. Stupid. How was it? The bridge fell down. The width of the creek is 17 to 18 meters. Crossing by tank is impossible sir. Close to the bank, there is the enemy's position surrounded by white wall, the height 5 meters, length about 150 m. That is White Wall House. The leftward of the enemy's positioning, about 70 to 80 m away. I could see the the first positioning of friend army. I see. Our army can be seen. I will go sir. Where to? I will put this for signal to friend army. Dangerous. I will go. Give me. Let Fujitaki do this sir. please. Let me do it sir. I will go. This is my turn. He was shot. Fujitaki! Are you shot? Where? Right arm sir. Minor sir. Fujitaki, give me your hand. Stretch more. This was erected by you, by your hand. Thank you sir. As soon as the White Wall House was collapsed, the situation of the front was progressed quickly. meanwhile the army and the navy were hailing to each other in order to protect the concession. hereby the preparation to launch all-out attack on Daijochin (Dachang), the key station of the enemy, had been in progress. Takanashi tank squadron had to spend several nights in a field around Nansho (Nanxiang). It was the standby for the all-out attack on Daijochin. Gee, everyday rainy sir. Uematsu, how many times you are watching the sen-nin-bari (1000 person's stiches) today? I am counting sir. Counting? I think this is cheating. They say 1000 persons, but this is only 500. Don't say that. It is given with good intention. Hey, what's the matter? Sorry. voice uttered unconsciously. Don't forget a sick man sleeping next. You are noisy. See? Stop it. Are you crazy? It is Goto. Seems so. What happened on him? Everyone is crazy somehow. Everything is the fault of this rain. How are you? Still a little fever. Ouch! What? Stomach pain again. Go. Please. come with me. Where to? There are full of dead persons. How coward you are. Please, first class private-dono. Damn, you call me with ''dono'' only these times. Go, go with him. But, look. Heavy rain. Uematsu. take one. Thank you sir. Shotaicho-dono, If we capture Daijochin, what will happen next? Next? We are saying ''then triumphal return.'' The war has just begun. At least it will take 5 to 6 years. So long years sir? The enemy is not only China. Big ones behind them. Actually, they are tougher. The third powers try to prevent the construction of New East Asia. I think you know. Yes I do sir. For example, If you understand, that's enough. The war has just begun. That's long way to go sir. Yes, it is. It is, indeed. Shotaicho-dono, are you going somewhere sir? Yes, I will see our men. Give me my coat. Hey, where are you going to? Well, a little bit... I see. We go sir. All right. How about him? He has still fever. That's too bad. I feel much better after looked by doctor last night. Don't you have a chill? You must be in warm. Go to my tent and bring my blanket. Wait. That's too good to me. I will get divine punishment. Don't be silly. Go and get it. I go sir. You shouldn't force yourself. ls there no particular? No sir. The sound of your harmonica is getting worse. Yes sir, due to this rain, it got rust. Protect the remains from rain. Some men have loose bowels. Take care. Yes sir. Attention! Number! 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. .. Salute to chutaicho-dono! Face Right! 62 men under Lieutenant Nishizumi, all gathered. Listen carefully. Tomorrow morning, the squadron will start to move to Daijochin finally. Time will be informed later. Each unit must be prepared for that. After prepared, try to take sleep till next order. Over. Salute to chutaicho-dono. Face Right ! October 26th, Daijochin fell. That day, the Takanashi tank squadron was working through the front as spearhead. On 27th, the next day, they quickly moved to Soshu (Suzhou) riverside. then they turned over for the day and joined the main force Hosoki regiment, they settled at Hinan University in the north of Shingyochin. But the next day they were suddenly ordered to attack Nansho (Nanxiang) The main force of the regiment moved to Chinkagakusho. Chutaicho Takanashi was injured again, therefore, Lieutenant Nishizumi took the control the squadron again. Accordingly he joined the battles of Shakataku and Manowan bay. Yamabe, Prepare for advance. The first squadron reporting sir. Good. Takanashi squadron reporting, The squadron, at 18:40, broke through the first position of the enemy in Manowan, and currently attacking their second position sir. Hey, move away! Dangerous!

No, nothing. So, the rest is Yamabe shotaicho's tank alone. When we were back, a tank followed us. What is that? It was Yamabe shotaicho-dono's sir. Then they must come back by now. Strange. O, I can hear a sound. Yamabe shotaicho-dono, Yamabe chui (lieutenant)-dono. They are late. What happens? O, returned. Warrant officer Okada I led the squadron and returned sir. Good. Must be tough work. Where is Nishizumi? Yamabe shotai-cho's vehicle is not back yet, so he is looking for. Yamabe's? That's bad. Uematsu, here. Yamabe! Yamabe shotaicho dono!

Be careful. Yamabe shotaicho-dono! Yamabe! Who is it? Chutaicho-dono. Yamabe? Uematsu sir. Oh, what? Yamabe juni-dono returned sir. Yamabe returned? Good. Yamabe! Hey, good. Good. I'm sorry for worrying you sir. No, nothing. Good. Just good. Shotaicho-dono, I made these. Please use sir. Thank you. I made geta. You did well sir. This is very useful. Thank you, thank you. What is it? Commander Hosoki waiting you at pergola sir. I see. I wonder what is it. Hey you must smile. I am not good at it. Oh no. What's the matter? Film is running out. Gee. Are you sure sir? The photo was taken? Don't say. Thank you. Why don't you go back to the rear to cure the wound? I told you the same a while ago but you evaded. Nishizumi, the commander is very concerned about you. Make yourself fresh at the hospital. Do so Nishizumi. I am sorry for your concern sir. But the wound is minor, no problem sir. Considering infantry officer, I can ride in tank and fight. That's grateful. But the war will not be ended with this, it will continue long. You must take care of yourself now. Murayama taii (captain)-dono, if you were me, are you going to be replaced just because such minor wound? Well, In addition, currently Takanashi chutaicho was replaced due to his injury, the squadron is under my control. Commander! Nishizumi would never accept the replacement sir. Do you know this piece? It is the song of Meiji-setsu (Emperor Meiji's birthday). It's already November. Yes. Look, fine weather! I can't believe the fighting goes on in front of my eyes. Indeed. Mails arrived. Letters? Hurry. Tell them in the outside. Mails arrived. They look so happy. Letters are the best. Goto, you go too. I go sir. He has five children. Nishizumi chui-dono, you got a mail sir. Thank you. They arrived at a time. Big mess. Well done. Take one. Thank you sir. The mails to us not arrived yet? Not yet sir. You can't wait. Well, not so. From who? Arakawa Tatsuji. Young brother of Private Arakawa sir. Nishizumi butaicho (commander)-sama, He called me butaicho. Sir, my big brother was war dead in honor. I told my classmates that my big brother died in honor while listening horn rush. I am proud of him. All my classmates admired him, great and great. I won't cry for big brother's death. Mother cried a little. Then mother said me ''Mother is not crying''. And she smiled a little. I smiled too. Goh, you must read after this. Uematsu, you can go to sleep. Maybe this is the weather of continent. Suddenly got chilled. Snow still continues. It will be piled up. Where is shotaicho-dono? He is here. What is it, Goto? A native woman gave birth to a child. Baby? How the baby? The baby is crying and fine but, the woman is injured. Pity. But giving birth in the battlefield, that's a novel woman. Matsuoka, call gun'i (military dr.)-dono. But shotaicho-dono, isn't it funny that military doctor for childbirth? Funny or not, he is better than our caring. I think I heard that the doctor in Araki unit was obstetrician. Go Matsuoka. I go sir. Where is the woman? The house across the street. All right. I 'll see. Chinese baby is red like as Japanese baby. No difference from Japanese baby. It is not crying in Chinese, is it? Of course not. ls this the baby? How about the woman? She is groaning in the back room. Looks weird. No one can come close. Goto, bring the fire here. You injured here. Don't worry. Japanese soldiers will not harm you. What to do? Goh, give back the baby to the woman. Mother's love is not different. Indeed. Scary woman. Morita gun-i-dono, Here it is sir. Dr. is not obstetrician sir? I am pediatrician. It is similar sir. But Mr. Nishizumi is very kind man. I never expect to see childbirth in the battlefield. Here sir. Thank you for your coming. But I must tell you I have no experience of childbirth. You don't? I see. The woman was injured her arm. Please look. There? Matsuoka, our unit has two cans of milk, I think. Bring that. And if you find futon or blanket bring it also. I will do sir. You are so kind as if you are her husband. This is piercing bullet wound. Painful? Now, little bit piercing. She is not screaming like you. Don't say. Are you living this house? Yes. Why didn't you escape? We are plundered by Chinese soldiers. I failed to escape. How about your husband? I lost him. Your husband left you and ran away. He is cold-blooded. He didn't leave me. I was lost. I see. I said wrong. Sorry. You speak Chinese very well. I went for Manchurian Incident for a year. I learned only a little then. No, no, you are great. Shotaicho dono, is this all right sir? Good. Oosumi chui-dono waiting you in the room sir. Oosumi what? He said he was in the military academy with you, now moved from North China. I see. Good, Oosumi came. My job done. You are free sir. Thank you for everything sir. I see, I see. Excuse me, lieutenant. Thank you sir. Matsuoka, send Dr. I go sir. Give him this. Don't worry. Take a rest well. Give the baby milk. Take care of her. I never expect you appear. Appear? Don't say. How about North China? I realize that a gun bullet cannot hit me so easily. So you worked had badly. Yes badly. You also has done very well. I was told. Uematsu, You talked too much again. No sir. Just a little. Don't talk much. Sir. Nishizumi, What did you do with the picture of Noguchi? Noguchi? Oh, I have. See? I have here. How about yours? I have too. Noguchi was fighting around North China with you. And now he is fighting around in Middle China battles with you too. Anyway, Noguchi had bad luck. Before graduation of Military Academy he was dead. So he is now pleased that he can fight together with us. Listen Oosumi, next, I want give him a chance to enter Nanking with us. That's no problem. I am confident that I never be hit by bullet. Me too. Then we three will enter Nanking together. Old trio will come back. Finished sir. Thank you. Oosumi, you can stay tonight, can't you? No. I can't. My unit is camping a little bit rear from here. I heard your Hosoki regiment is camping nearby, so I hurriedly came. Now, I must come back. See you again. Anyway, nice to see you. Yes, nice to see you. Good-bye. Be well. You too. Snow still continues. Getting cold tonight. See you! Bye. ls it true? Yes. Come. What's the matter? Shotaicho dono, What happens Goto? The woman of the last night was gone. Really? I guess that her husband came in last night and left with her. Disgusting woman. She was treated so kindly by shotaicho- dono, nevertheless... I will throw her in creek if I meet her again. Don't be so mad. She must be more pleased with her husband than my kindness. But she ran away leaving her baby. What? Leaving the baby? Pity. The baby was cold dead. I see. But we gave a mercy and she thanked last night. The baby was innocent. Let's make a grave for the baby. It is so small. This is it. What should be named? Shotalcho-dono, it was sutego (abandoned child). How about Suteko? How about Shinako (Chinese girl)? Grave of Shinako. Yukiko (snow girl)? Kumiko, absolutely. Stupid, it is your girlfriend's name. Leave it to me. Mumeishi....(no name child) Not mumei, but Munako. I see. Nanashi-no-Gonbei (No name Gonbei). This is not Gonbei but Gonko. Shotaicho-dono, Infantry Lieutenant calling you sir. It's a long time since I we met last sir. At a place near lnfun, At Kokataku, I was given tobacco from you sir. Now I remember. Excuse me sir. No change sir? I'm fine. Nice to see you well. I am still alive. Now for Nanking? When we enter Nanking, why don't we have a drink? Very good. It's a promise. Excuse me. I got bean blisters on my foot. Walking a little bit hard. You made it. This is good. Great Shotaicho-dono, please pray first. Wait, wait sir. Goto, a baby does not smoke. Yes, you are right sir. For Nanking, Nanking. The capital of enemy is getting close. The main force moving from Koin (Jiangyin) area along the southern coast of Yangtze, the left wing force moving from Kotoku (Guangde) through hill zone, and the center force chasing the fleeing enemy. Now they were continuously moving toward Nanking for full attack. Nanking Castle Fell December 13, 1937 I brought this sir. Thank you. He is late. On the telephone he told that he would come by 18:00. Oosumi told you so? Yes sir, the lieutenant himself said so. So this is it. Yes sir. With dozen of this and tobacco, a petty officer came. He said it was from Lieutenant Nakamura of Mizuno unit. You will understand by that. I see. Take one. Thank you very much sir. Remember? After the Kozanryo battle. we stayed Kokataku for a couple of days. At that time an infantry was in trouble of making camp and stayed a night with us. Yes, I remember now. He was the officer of the unit. I gave him a half pack of tobacco. We met at Kotakuto. It was the last. Did he die in battle? Yes. He looked gentle old man. We promised to drink together when we enter Nanking. He was suffering in walking. Was he? No, you can sit. He is late. What? Shotaicho-dono, They say we will go Joshu (Xuzhou) next. We don't know yet. Shotaicho-dono, Since landing, in Shanghai and Nanking, my duty was cooking sir. Day and night, just cooking. I know. I know. I didn't assign you in fighting, but. there was no particular reason. Maybe I can promise for next time. Maybe you are considering that I have big family, so if you cared about it, I don't feel good sir. No. I don't. Please. I waited long. Sorry, sorry. Excuse me sir. I had to visit many people for greeting. Greet visiting? What is it? I will return. Return? I came you for farewell. North China again? No, I got an order to return Japan. Oh, you will return? Yes. I'll be back and wait you. That is waiting in vain. I will be the soil of Continent. Oh. excuse me. ls it your kakizome (first calligraphy in the year)? Yes, not good, though. If Britain and Soviet start anti-Japan I would go to Mt. Himalaya or Urals to show the spirit of Japanese man Mt. Himalaya or Urals, that what you are. Why don't we talk all over the night? If it will not disturb your duty, I am OK. No problem. One sleepless night is nothing. Well, then, With this picture, talk the three of us. Mine also. Give Noguchi one. Sure. When you are back Japan you must give back this picture to his father. Your Noguchi was fighting in North China and Middle China with you. His father must be pleased. Yes, I will do. I will go Kumamoto after all. if you want me to deliver your message to your family, Me? Nothing. Let's start. Defeated in Nanking, the government of Chiang Kai-shek moved to Hankou, and strengthened the guard around Joshu (Xuzhou).
