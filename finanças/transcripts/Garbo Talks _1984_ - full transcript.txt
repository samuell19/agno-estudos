I'll take you far away from Paris, where there are no unhappy memories for either of us. Yes. Where the sun will help me take care of you and make you well again. We'll go back to the country where we were happy all in one summer. Oh... Oh, if only we could. If only we could. We can, we will, as soon as you're well enough. (GROANS) (GASPS) Oh. (WEAKLY) I can't. (ESTELLE SOBBING) Nanine. Nanine! Nanine, get the doctor quickly. The doctor... (MOUTHING) If you can't make me live, how can he? No, no. Don't say such things, Marguerite. You'll live. You must live. Perhaps it's better if I live in your heart, where the world can't see me. If I am dead, there'll be no staying of our love. (SHUSHING) Don't think such things, Marguerite. Even if we can't go to the country today... God. ...think of how happy we will be, how happy we shall be again. Think of the day you found the four-leaf clover and all the good luck it's going to bring us. Think of the vows we heard Nichette and Gustave make and that we're going to make to each other. This is for life, Marguerite. (ESTELLE SOBBING) Marguerite. Marguerite. Don't leave me. Marguerite, come back. Come back. (HUMMING) (SNIFFS) Oh, God. I had to go to the credit department on seventh. There's this line of people waiting. I had other things I could've been doing. Finally, I tell someone the problem. She says, "This could've been handled in belts." And no one seemed to care. No one apologized. No one said, "Miss, I'm sorry for the inconvenience." (SIGHS) Well, in California, somebody would've apologized. In California, a salesperson has feelings. Gillie, I want to go home to Los Angeles. I want us both to go. I talked to Dad. He'll give us the money. There's so much to do in California. Anything you could ever want in life is an hour's drive away. Gillie? (GROANS) (WHISTLES) Where's my coat rack? Elaine, have you seen my coat rack? Elaine, have you... Elaine, have you seen my... You're not Elaine. I'm Harriet. Hi. Where's Elaine? I don't know. This isn't my calculator. This isn't my typewriter. Who are they? (HUMMING) You were moved down the hall, Gilbert. Room 2601. (BELL DINGS) Elaine, what's going on? Kellerman got a promotion. They moved him into your office. I'm supposed to work in here? It doesn't have a window. It's got a Rauschenberg. No, I can't work in there. I just handle the Xerox, Gilbert. But it... Mr. Plotkin? I came in... Oh, we moved your office. We needed the space for Kellerman. I knew you'd understand. Yeah, but... Things like offices mean a lot to Kellerman. He's a little too image conscious. Not like you, Gilbert. You could do a fine job anywhere. You can balance ledgers in the middle of Sardi's. I'm working on a raise for you. If we get it, you take me to Sardi's. (PHONE RINGS) Gilbert Rolfe. Wha... Oh, no. No. No. Right away. Right away. Oh! What's the matter? My mother's in jail. Again? Hey, I'm thirsty. Uh, I said I'm thirsty. Who do you have to pay off to get a little water around here! I'd understand if we were in the desert, I wouldn't push for water. I'd accept the given fact. But we're in the middle of New York City here. We're at 10th Street and 7th Avenue. There must be an empty paper cup and a leaky hydrant somewhere in the neighborhood! They don't give you nothing in detention, honey. Not true. I was arrested last month in Brooklyn. They gave me a sandwich and some cigarettes. It was mozzarella cheese. Yeah. I'm here for Estelle Rolfe. I'm her son. Oh, yes. Bail's $500. Sign both copies. Estelle. I told you I didn't want you to come down any more. I could take care of myself. Mom, what am I supposed to do? Your lawyer calls me at the office. He leaves a message with the receptionist. Do you know how embarrassed I was? There's no need to be. Okay, your court date will be the fifth of next month. There's nothing in life to ever be embarrassed about. I always taught you that. Mom, you live in a world of your own. No, I got company, maybe not you. Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink! What did you do? I stole a box of frozen zucchini from the market. They caught me when I left. Why did you do that? They were changing the prices of the lettuce that was already on the shelf. I said to the manager, "Did you make a pricing mistake?" He said, "No. There was a frost in Arizona and prices had gone up." And I said, "But not for the lettuce that's already on the shelf." I was planning on buying two heads of lettuce. The difference was 64 cents. The zucchini costs exactly 64 cents. How much was bail? $500. I'll give you a check. What's it like being assigned to the ghetto? Oh, Mother, for God's sakes. Do they assign you to the ghetto? Sometime. Sure, when there's an arrest to be made. They're using you because of your race. It's unfair. You shouldn't stand for it. They're making you into a traitor to your own people. Let's go. Mom, is this ever going to stop? Is what ever going to stop? Oh, Ma, come on. Marching to Washington, getting arrested, lying down in front of cars... Gilbert, that's who I am. You are who you are, I am who I am. Since I was six years old, always crusading, always making trouble. You wouldn't let me go on a field trip to a steel mill? There was a strike against it. Everybody else got to go. Everybody came home with a little box of nails except me. What did you miss? That is not the point. Gilbert, listen, I like what I'm doing. I don't mind going to jail for something I believe in. It's a privilege. Privilege? Did it ever hurt you? I was always there when you needed me. Was a meal ever not waiting for you? Were you ever sick alone? Look, Mom, all I'm saying is, why don't you just relax a little? I'm relaxed. Let things take care of themselves. Things don't take care of themselves. Mom, take it easy. If your generation would be a little more active, I could take it a little more easy. You hungry? One beef and broccoli, please. (SIGHS) (GROANS) How's Lisa? She's fine. Her father, the Beverly Hills contractor? Mother. He cheats on his income tax. You don't know that. He wears tinted glasses. She still want to go back to Los Angeles? Uh-huh. You know, the sun brings out the best in her. Mom, how come you never liked Lisa? Tennis is one way to get through life. How's your father? He's fine. Claire? We're going there for dinner Sunday. Claire still make cakes? (JACKHAMMER WHIRRING) (MAN WHISTLES) MAN: Look at the little brown fox, huh? (WHISTLING CONTINUES) Hey, happy tits, come up and sit on my face! Hey, I got an electric tongue and it never gets tired! Mother, come on. (BEEPING) God! Who wanted a girl to sit on their face? Come on, one of you wanted someone to sit on your face so badly you screamed it all the way down to the pavement. Who was it? I got all day, and I can come back tomorrow. You mean the guy who whistled at that girl? Yeah, that's what I mean. Yeah, that was me. Well, that girl couldn't come. She was late for an appointment. So I came instead. I hope it's okay? Which one of you has got the electric tongue? Uh... Guess that was me. You plug it in or does it run on batteries? Now, listen, I... You know, we were just... What? Just... Just a joke. You think you got some special right to act like animals just because you work up high, huh? You think because you build buildings, you're exempt from showing a little class? You want someone to sit on your face? Roll up your car windows and scream it out on the highway and stop demeaning yourself in public. If your head's in the toilet, don't blow bubbles. Come, we'll ride down. (JANE EXHALING LOUDLY) (KNOCK ON DOOR) Excuse me. Elaine said I could find the Irving readout... It's right over there by the window. (EXHALING LOUDLY) Hi. Hi. I'm Jane Mortimer. Uh, Gilbert Rolfe. Are you new? Uh-uh. I was up on 27, but they're moving us around. Are you okay? Uh-huh. You're not having a seizure or anything, are you? I... My breathing exercises. Huh! One. Huh! Two. Huh! Three. I'm really an actress. Huh! Four. Huh! Five. Hey! I... O... U. (EXHALING) Could you hand me my cork, please? It's right there in the drawer. Your cork? Yes, please. (CONTINUES BREATHING EXERCISES) Thank you. (GARBLED) Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. This deepens the voice. An actress has to do many, many voices. And now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. This is from my first bottle of champagne. Could you help me up, please? Thank you. Um, would you like to try this? No, thank you. Uh, was there anything else? That was all. Could I see that picture of Garbo in your window? (CHUCKLES) It's from Grand Hotel. It's from Mata Hari. Grand Hotel. I own the shop. No, it's from Mata Hari. It's the scene in the prison cell where she has a reunion with Rosanoff just before they take her to the firing squad to be executed. Look at the costume, it's Mata Hari. It's $35. This isn't rare. I've seen it before. Then buy it before. The frame makes it higher. I'll take it without the frame. I don't sell it without the frame. It's $35. It's Mata Hari. Go to the movies. It looks beautiful and it smells good. Shrimp Wilshire. I got it in an article on California cooking. It's delicious. Best I've ever tasted. Your father likes shrimp and I try to make him happy. Mmm, I spoke to my parents. They send their regards. Oh, thank you. My father's dying for us to move to Los Angeles. He's offered Gilbert a fantastic job. Lisa. He doesn't want to take it. I have a job. You know, so often in life, we have to do what makes someone else happy. It's called give and take. You know my philosophy? It doesn't cost anything to give someone else a little joy. Ah. Bravo. How's your mother? She's been having migraine headaches. She got arrested again. How'd you find out? We still know the same people. Shoplifting. Wasn't exactly shoplifting. What would you call it? She got caught with beans in her pocketbook? Zucchini. What'd she have to do that for? She's got money. She still has the building in Flushing. She cited an injustice. Uh-huh. You know Claire and I are having an anniversary next month? Ten years. It's a long time, huh? Dad. Yeah. What made you fall in love with her? Claire? Mother. Mmm. It was the way she danced. How'd she dance? I met her at a party once. We were teenagers. How did she dance? She danced with everything. Her whole body, her whole being, everything. When she danced, she didn't think of anything else. She still watching her weight? Yeah. She's always watching her weight. God, we had fun. The day we got married, went down to the courthouse to get the license. They sent us to a clerk. His name was William Albert. She wouldn't let him write the license. She doesn't trust men, she says, with two first names. God, we had fun. Two first names. I don't know, we started drifting apart. Always got outraged by one thing or another. She couldn't take life as it comes. And I got tired, that's all. I worked plenty hard, I wanted peace and quiet. And she wouldn't give me that, the damn fool. If she would've changed just a little, meet me halfway. Claire. She's a good person, she's a good wife. Worships the ground I walk on. What more can a man ask for? She still wear orthopedic shoes? Yeah. She always had lousy feet. Hi. I'm going for a sandwich. You want to come? I probably should tell you, Jane. I'm married. I just invited you to eat a sandwich. Oh... Uh, okay. I think elevators are very sexual, don't you? I have this fantasy that I'm in an elevator all alone with this man that I've never met before in my entire life and he just keeps staring at me. All of a sudden, he reaches out and he touches my breast. Well, I think it's very inappropriate, but I don't stop him. The elevator's moving really slowly, we're at the World Trade Center, and he just keeps on touching me. We're at the 30th floor and he's feeling my waist, the elevator keeps going up, his hands keep going down. By the time we're at the 70th floor, we're actually having relations and he just leaves without even telling me his name. (MAN COUGHS) (ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING) Gilbert, we're here. Do you like working in that dark little room? It's not that bad. Boy, I'd get claustrophobia. I'm studying at the neighborhood playhouse. I'm really only accounting until something breaks. I need the work. People like you shouldn't have to work. You are prehistoric. Thank you. Actually, I'd like to be kept, but... I'm not the type. I'd like to keep you, but I don't have the money. Well, one day, when I'm very, very rich, I'm going to stay home all the time, just learning Moliere and ordering oyster-white veal from Fraser-Morris. Hmm, Moliere makes me laugh, and, well, Fraser-Morris is where the very, very rich buy all their tomatoes. Lisa, that was very good. It's the first time I've ever cooked Chinese. It took me three hours. Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop... Why don't you go into the living room and I'll serve coffee. Three hours. She could've read War and Peace. Where's my purse, Gilbert? Look on the hall table, will you? Bring me a glass of water, too, will you? GILBERT: Mom, are you all right? Yeah, yeah. I just have a little headache, that's all. (PHONE RINGS) Gilbert Rolfe. Oh, Dr. Cohen. Yes, how are you? What is it? You can't operate? There's no way. You can get other opinions, but there's nothing to be done. That's an attitude she won't understand. Why didn't Dr. Cohen tell me himself? What does he think I'm made of, butter? (SIGHS) Estelle Rolfe. Not Estelle Rolfe. You know, I know everybody's got to die, but I really thought I was going to be the first exception. Dr. Cohen wants you to go in the hospital. Mom, Lisa's father knows this neurosurgeon in Beverly Hills. I have Dr. Cohen. Mom, this man is a leader in his field. He works miracles. I don't believe in miracles. Come on, Mom. You've got to have hope. Honey, I got hope. I don't believe in miracles. You work with what you got. You don't always win. I've always accepted the given fact. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? Oh, hello, Doctor. Yes? Okay. Just a minute, please. He's gotten you a room at Murray Hill Hospital. He wants to know... I'm not going to Murray Hill. The dieticians are non-union. Mom! No. Could you get her into someplace else? She doesn't like Murray Hill Hospital. Why? I don't know why. Yes, okay. No, we'll be here. Mom, Dr. Cohen wants to start cobalt treatments. I know all about cobalt. Ma, you don't... You don't feel a thing. No, that's not what I mean. My hair. There is a chance it'll come out. I just had it dyed. Watch this. How long have I got? It's hard to tell. You could go on for quite a while. Don't give me that. How long have I got? Four to six months. I'll be back tonight. Well, I called Mr. and Mrs. Kozinski and they want to know if you felt like visitors, so I told them I thought it might be better if they waited a couple of days, give you a chance to settle in, get comfortable. They were terrific. They said they would look after the building, keep an eye on things for you. Gilbert, I want to meet Greta Garbo. Yeah, I want to meet Garbo. Mom, are you kidding? No. Mom, that's impossible. It's not impossible. She lives right here in New York City. Mother, why don't you just concentrate on getting better? Oh, I want to meet Garbo. Why? Why shouldn't I? I'm dying. She wants to meet Garbo. It's like a last wish. It's not my last wish. I have a lot more. Just short on time. How about lunch? Oh. Uh, I'm sorry, I can't. Oh, okay. Gilbert. Mr. Plotkin. You were an hour late coming in this morning. I let it pass. But now you're 20 minutes late coming in from lunch. I'm very sorry, Mr. Plotkin. This is not a library, Gilbert. AUTOMATED VOICE: The number you have called is out of service. Please check your telephone directory and make sure you're dialing correctly. (DOG BARKING) Mr. Dokakis? Mr. Dokakis? (DOOR LOCK OPENING) Who wants him? I do. I don't need an accountant. I use the short form. No, um, Mr. Dokakis, excuse me. Are you the same man that took photographs of Greta Garbo? She can't sue. I stood 50 feet away. I know the law. You can't deprive a man of his livelihood. No, Mr. Dokakis. Mr. Dokakis, please? (LOCK CLICKS) Mr. Dokakis, I've got to talk to you. (SIGHS) Mr. Dokakis, my mother is dying. She is in New York Hospital, Room 808 right now. She has a brain tumor and she wants to meet Garbo. (DOOR LOCK OPENING) You think I'm going to say something wise-ass, don't you? I'm not going to say anything wise-ass. You want something, call my agent. (DOORBELL BUZZES) (DOORBELL BUZZES) (DOORBELL BUZZES) (DOORBELL BUZZES) Miss Sonya Apollinar? (WHISPERING) Yes. Miss Apollinar, I need to hire a client of yours. You wish to hire a client of mine? Yes. (BUZZING) Don't do this to me. Go on. Come on. Just for a little while, then I'll come back. We'll go out to dinner. Go on, let's get in there. (POUNDING ON DOOR) Coming! I just... Coming. Una momento. Come in, please. (STAMMERING) Please, just come in. Mi casa es su casa. Please. (CHUCKLES) You'll have to forgive me. Uh, I'm... I'm redecorating. Just all goes so slow, doesn't it? See... (CLEARS THROAT) Won't you sit down? Please? Hmm? Sit. (CHUCKLES) I want to hire Angelo Dokakis. But of course. Angelo. A brilliant photographer. And what is the nature of this assignment? I want to talk to him. Uh-huh. Do you mind if I ask about what? I need to find someone. Ah. Whom do you wish to find? Greta Garbo. But of course. (CATS SNARLING) Oh, excuse me, just... Just a minute. (SNARLING STOPS) I've got to get a dog. I'll do anything. I don't care about the cost. Oh? Well, I mean, is that all you want? To find Garbo, hmm? Well, that shouldn't be so difficult. I mean, naturally, I can help you. One must simply know where to look. Mr. Dokakis charges $250 a day, one week minimum, plus expenses. Okay. That's okay. It's okay. It's okay. (CHUCKLES) It's okay. Believe me, it's... It's no problem. I wish all my assignments were such a breeze. (MEOWS) Oops. I'll need a retainer. $500 to start. I'll write you a check. Could you make my commission check out separately to cash? I... $50. Sit down. Here. You can use... You know, Angelo is very, very particular about the work that he chooses to do. Could he start right away? Oh, well, I just don't see any reason why not. The check. (LAUGHS) Oh. Hello, Mr. Plotkin. Hi, this is Gilbert. Mr. Plotkin, I am so sick. Yeah, I can't come in today. I knew you'd understand. (COUGHS) Thank you, sir. That's where she lives. The 10th floor. I've never been inside. You took pictures of her there? I took them with a telescopic lens from over there. I rented a room. She's got several rooms. They're empty, mostly. Is this it? You just wait around all day hoping she'll come out? If you're lucky, all day. Sometimes it takes weeks. I followed Princess Margaret for a month. All around the Caribbean. I caught her sunbathing without a top. If she'd rolled over, I'd be a millionaire today. (LAUGHS) I mean it. What's she like, your mother? I don't know. I... The quiet type, huh? Yeah. Mine, too. How long she been sick? A few weeks. She started getting headaches. Sometimes she'd lose a step and... Little things. Yeah. What time is it? Uh, 6:15. 6:15? Listen, Rolfe, for all I know, she isn't even here. She spends a lot of time in Spain. Spain? Fire Island, France, Antigua... (GROANS) It's 5:30. I could meet you again tomorrow, but I won't take any more of your money. Besides, you know where she lives. But you're making a mistake. Even if you see her, she'll disappear the moment she notices you. She's totally inaccessible. Angelo. Stay just a little longer. I'm tired of chasing people, renting hotel rooms, helicopters. I'm tired of spying on them. The way they look at me, so condescending. It just doesn't make sense anymore. I'm sorry about your mother. Sounds like a nice lady. It was raining cats and dogs. I saw the Goodyear blimp pass by right outside my window there. (SIGHS) The Knicks beat the Celtics, 97-96. (GROANS VERY LOUDLY) I want an eclair. Please, honey, bring me an eclair, would you? My turn? Yeah. I'm having trouble holding things lately. I got a terrific word. There are two checks to Angelo Dokakis. One for $450 and another for $675! What's this check for cash, $50? A check for $75, cash? Our balance is $600. We have no money left. Gillie, you know what we are? Oh, my... Do you know what we are? No. Oh, Gilbert. What? I can't say it. Oh, God in heaven, I can't say the word. What are we? We are poor. Lisa, can you take care of the maintenance this month? Are you serious? To cut into the principal? My father says it's like spitting on God. What are you doing? I'm sewing. I know you're sewing. What are you sewing? Tell me what you're sewing. Tell me this minute! Can I help you, sir? Acme delivery. This is for Miss Garbo. There's no one here by that name. I know for a fact that... There is no one here by that name, sir. Okay, then this is for the lady in apartment 10A? There is no lady in 10A. You're aware this job pays minimum wage? Yes. I've made my peace with that. You supply your own uniforms. No problem. No problem at all. You can buy Guthrie's clothes. You're about the same size. I'll speak with Guthrie. Guthrie's dead. Oh. This is a part-time job. Yes. You must be here at 2:45 for the afternoon deliveries. Yes, sir. 2:45, not 3:00. I understand, sir. You don't harbor any resentment toward the upper class, do you, Rolfe? No. Good. We don't tolerate rudeness. There's still a place for the rich in New York City. Excuse me, Mr. Plotkin. What can I do for you, Gilbert? I would like to start work earlier, earlier than 8:30. I have a job in the afternoon. I'd like to leave here by 2:00. Well, we have an open start policy. You can start anytime you want to, as long as you put in eight hours. What time did you have in mind? Well, I would like to come in at 7:00. 7:00 to 2:00? Yes, sir. That's seven hours. I'll make up the difference. I'll work on Saturday. The office is closed on Saturday. I won't take a vacation. One can't use vacation time. It's the rule. You could come in at 6:00. 6:00? Nothing's working at 6:00. The computers are down at 6:00. Well, come in, anyway. Gilbert, are you crazy? I don't believe it. What's happening to me? What's happening to my life? I won't come out until you take that thing off. Honey, try and understand. No. I won't be part of this circus anymore. Am I being unfair? If I'm being unfair, just tell me so. You're not being unfair. This is too much. You're making me a nervous wreck. Oh, I'm starting to ovulate. I can feel it. Now, Mrs. Jacobs at 51st and Madison, Mrs. Harrison, the same building, one floor down. 52nd and Park, Mr. Blaustein. Double down to 49th, the Waldorf. Miss Moore has an apartment there. We send her biscuits and Perrier water every Tuesday. Jacobs, Harrison, Blaustein, Moore. Always get a signature. Don't forget that. Yes, sir. Hi. Hi. Oh, hi. You know, I never see you anymore. You eat lunch at 10:00. I come in early. I need my afternoons free. Oh. I'm up for a role. Oh? Yeah. As You Like It. Joe Papp. Oh. Good luck. Thank you. Well, I'll be seeing you, huh? Krebs on 56th, Detweiler on Second and 55th, Bluttman, next door, on 55th, Kronhauser on 53rd, Cavaleri on 53rd and Brown on 50th. Rolfe, this order for Brown on 50th... When you arrive, you tell the doorman, "I'm from Fraser-Morris and I have the order for Brown." Then you look at him and ask, "Are you from Oslo?" Do you understand? Yes, sir. I say I'm from Fraser-Morris and... No, no. You must do it exactly as I say it. I'm sorry. "Good afternoon. I'm from Fraser-Morris..." There's no good afternoon. You say, "I am from Fraser-Morris and I have the order for Brown. "Are you from Oslo?" You won't get in otherwise. I'll have to send somebody else. I don't wanna make two trips! Yes, sir. Don't ask me to explain. One day, maybe, when I know you better. I'm from Fraser-Morris and I have the order for Brown. Are you from Oslo? 10B. Service elevator's downstairs. 10B. Miss Garbo, Miss Garbo. Miss Brown, Miss Brown, please, please. (MUTTERING) Fraser-Morris? This order's for Miss Brown. Thank you. I'll take it. You're not Miss Brown. I work for Miss Brown. Mr. Morganelli told me distinctly these were to go to a Miss Brown and no one else. It's quite all right, believe me. Miss Brown is away. You'll have to give them to me. I'd like to leave a note for Miss Brown! Please! Rita around the corner came to see me today. She gave me a manicure. Look. Mom, I've been trying to find her. Do you think you will? I'm doing what I can. I can't promise anything. Give me a kiss. Oh, I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you so much. Mom, don't be afraid. You know, I'm not afraid. I'm mad. I'm not gonna get to know who the next president of the United States is. Me, of all people, hmm? I got a right to know. Angelo, this is Gilbert. I'm fine, thank you. Angelo, listen, you have got to help me. I am desperate. Yeah, you said she goes to an island. Fire Island. Oh, God, I am so stupid. I couldn't remember. All I could think of was Elba. You still got a pulse, Estelle. What do they pay you? $7.10 an hour. How do you live on that? Oh, got three boyfriends. Why don't you ask for more? It's all in the contract. When's the contract up? One year, two years. You wanna keep making $7.10 an hour? Are you kidding? Nobody's gonna change it but you. Me? I'm Esperanza Gonzales from San Juan. I've got two kids. I live in Queens in an apartment with my sister. Who's gonna listen to me? Hey, Sanchez? Mmm-hmm. When is our contract up? What contract? We've got a contract, stupid. When is our contract up? What contract? Jesus. The dog is peeing on your leg. (EXCLAIMS) You want a pair of pants? Thank you. Thank you. I'm Bernie Whitlock. Gilbert Rolfe. I'm not gay. I am. Guess the whole boat is. With rare exceptions. So, what do you do? I'm an accountant. I'm working my way up from the mailroom at Bloomingdale's. You know, that was a joke. Actually, I work in the men's department at Alexander's. Sometimes I lie, I say Bloomingdale's. Depends on what crowd I'm in. This is my third year on the island. The people are friendly. The older I get, the less I care about sex. I'm looking for someone I can talk to. That's hard to find. What about you? What about me? What are you looking for? We're all looking for something. You're not gonna believe me. I'm looking for Greta Garbo. You're looking for the Garbo? Mmm-hmm. Is this a joke? No. Mind if I ask why? It's a long story. It's gotta be. I saw her once last summer walking along the beach. She was wearing a big hat and sunglasses and a long, flowing cape. Yeah, she was... She was walking along in a light rain without an umbrella. I don't think anybody even knew who she was. But then, all of a sudden, she just disappeared into a house and I never saw her again. Excuse me. Would you remember the house? It was along here somewhere. I didn't take that good a look. Please, it is very important. Would you have dinner with me tonight? I'm sorry, I can't. I just hate to eat alone. So does my mother. She goes to a restaurant, she looks to see if someone else is alone. If they look interesting, she asks them if she can join them. And what if they say no? She'll ask someone else. One rejection, I lose my appetite. It might've been that one there. You mind if I ask you a question? Why are you looking for Garbo? My mother wants to meet her. Your mother's a trip. Yeah. I thought you were doing it for an autograph. Good. What about the pants? A present. Look, if your mother ever wants to meet me, I'm at the Queens Boulevard branch. In Queens. (SIGHS) Miss Garbo, please. There is nobody here of that name. This is the Von Klammer residence. I have got to talk to her. There is no Garbo here. Look, she is here. I know she's here. (BOAT MOTOR RUNNING) Wait. Wait. Wait, please. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait. What time is the next ferry? 7:00 in the morning. You been up all night? What do you think? I slept on the beach at Fire Island. What were you doing at Fire Island? Looking for Garbo. Looking for Garbo. Mr. Plotkin called. You didn't go to work on Friday. You didn't call to say you weren't coming? I know. Gilbert, is there another woman in your life? No. Are you sure? What? I said, are you sure there's not another woman in your life? I'm sure. Those things happen. People change, lose interest. Listen, I'm from California. I went to visit your mother last night. Her hearing is worse. She didn't recognize me. I couldn't tell if it was intentional or not. Gillie, I spoke to my mother and Dad. They're concerned about me. They want me to come home. Dad offered to come here and get me and take me back. Naturally, that isn't necessary. I'm a big girl now. What did you say? I told them I wouldn't come until... After Estelle... I try and do the right thing. I don't always succeed, but I do try. You know something, Lisa. You don't have to try anymore. If you wanna leave, why don't you just leave? You don't have to wait around for Mom to die. I'll tell you something. When Mom first met you, she said you were affected, you were pretentious. She didn't like you. She... What did she say? What? I told her you spoke two languages. She said, "Yes. English and Gucci." The feeling's mutual. My parents have never been so embarrassed in their whole lives. Your mother wouldn't cross a picket line for her own son's wedding. You gonna go through this again? The bartender's union was striking the Beverly... We offered to get her into the laundry room, but she wouldn't budge. She does not cross picket lines. Her own son's wedding. That is the way she is. I'll come back, if you want me to. I think it's better this way. I feel really sad. We had a perfect marriage. All I wanted was a home, children and security, but... Lately with you, it's been one surprise after another. I don't want surprises, Gillie. Next agent over, please. I paid the difference. I didn't want your father to think I was a schmuck. He will, anyway. How's this, Estelle? A little more brightness. Okay? Fine. Can I get you anything else? Mmm-mmm. Estelle, our contract is up the first of the year. They want to raise us from $7.10 an hour to $7.90. None of us knows what to do. We don't wanna make waves. Make waves. We don't wanna start something. Start something. Okay. Excuse me. I'm looking for Estelle Rolfe. Oh. Mrs. Rolfe is resting. She's not supposed to have any visitors. I won't stay long. I'm her husband. Ex-husband. Jenny. You will have to make it short. Yes, thank you. (SOBS) You damn fool. MAN 1 ON TV: Williams got away from Woodson, got it to Bill Cartwright for the jam and he's fouled. What a terrific pass by Ray Williams and, also, it was very alert of Bill Cartwright to anticipate that pass. MAN 2 ON TV: Yes, it was. Here you see Ray Williams moving without the ball, Woodson going for the steal. Now, this breaks the defense down as Ray starts to the hoop. Here comes Meriwether with a nice little pass to Cartwright. He's fouled right there as he hits... LEON: Oh, Ninotchka, don't take things so seriously. Nothing's worth it, really. Please. Relax. I beg you, Sergeant. Smile. What? Will you smile? Why? Well, just smile. At what? At anything. At the whole ridiculous spectacle of life, at people being so serious, taking themselves pompously, exaggerating their own importance. If you can't think of anything else to laugh at, you can laugh at you and me. Why? Because we're an odd couple. Then you should go back to your table. No, I can't leave you. I won't, not yet. Not until I've made you laugh at least once. Ha, ha. Now go back to your table. Oh, that's not a laugh. I mean a laugh from the heart. I know. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Wait a minute. Let me think of one. I've got it. It seems that there were two Frenchmen who went to America. On which boat? Let's drop it. I don't think you'd care very much for that one, anyway. (MUSIC PLAYS) (ALL APPLAUDING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Believe me, Elizabeth Rennick is the forgotten genius of film. Come on, Adolph. You've gotta be kidding. No, no, I mean it. Elizabeth Rennick was every bit as good as Garbo. MAN: He never stops. He never stops. She appeared in a lot of the Garbo pictures. Little parts. You know, some actresses start out playing bits and work their way to the top? Well, she did just the opposite. (ALL LAUGHING) Poor soul. She comes here often to watch her old flicks. (DOORBELL BUZZES) GILBERT: Jane? Gilbert? Yeah. How do you find an actress? I'm an actress. I mean, a particular actress. You call Actor's Equity. Yeah. Yeah. All actors are listed with them. But today is Saturday. It is? They're closed. They are? You can call them on Monday. You just ask for membership. Membership? Then you tell them who you're looking for. Who I'm looking for. Then you look it up. I can look it up. Are you free? I pictured you with someone rich. Rich men are so peculiar. They always order California wine and then defend it. Aren't you married? We're separated. She's in L.A. She's been there a few weeks now. She's probably very tan by now. Gilbert, I don't... I don't want you to take this too seriously. Being with someone permanently just isn't in my plans. (PHONE RINGS) Hello. Actor's Equity. It's for you, Mr. Goldhammer. Membership. Goldhammer. Hi. I'd like an address for Elizabeth Rennick, please. Who's calling? Gilbert Rolfe. Gilbert Rolfe? I'm not familiar with that name. It's a personal matter. It's very urgent that I reach her. Personal. I'm sorry. I can't give out that information unless I'm familiar with your company. (PHONE RINGS) Membership. Goldhammer. Yes, this is David Barrick's office. How may I help you? I need an address on Elizabeth Rennick. Didn't you just call? No. Are you a casting director? Uh, yes, I am. Then look it up in your player's guide. Yes? Mr. Goldhammer? Yes. How do you do? I'm Marian Lane. Who? We met at the Tony Awards. Oh, I haven't been to the Tonys, not in years. It was some time ago, but, oh, I remember you. Why, you're the backbone of this organization, as I recall. Most people don't know I exist. Oh, I certainly do. You're one of those people that you can never quite get out of your mind. Thank you. Our phones are out. I'm working for Jimmy Nederlander now, and he needs some information on Elizabeth Rennick. Nobody's called for Elizabeth Rennick in 15 years. It's going to be the chance of a lifetime for her. She's very old. Mr. Goldhammer, what a sense of humor you have. Her number. (PHONE RINGS) ELIZABETH ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello. This is Elizabeth Rennick. 555-8318. I am not at home. I'm rehearsing a new production of Romeo and Juliet in which I've been cast as the nurse. I turned the part down several times 'cause I... Well, I don't do supporting roles, but Joe Papp, the brilliant producer of A Chorus Line, kept calling back and finally, I said, "Okay, I'll give it a try." We're at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park for rehearsals, which I expect won't take more than two weeks, if everyone behaves professionally. Sometimes these off-Broadway companies are a bunch of animals, smoking dope, and everyone trying to get into everyone's pants. No one cares about Shakespeare, but if all goes well... Excuse me. I'm looking for Elizabeth Rennick. (SHUSHING) MAN: Miss Rennick, we're ready for your scene again. Miss Rennick! Stand over here. That's it. Right here. Fine. Good. Good. Okay, and please try not to wobble! Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me. Now, by my maidenhair... Maidenhead, Miss Rennick, not maidenhair! I want to cut that line. We can't cut it. She's been making that same mistake all week. You can't remember your lines! I forget my lines once! You remembered them once! It's not working! All right, everybody, lunch, one hour! Miss Rennick, please, I need your help. Are you and she still friends? Do you ever see her... I never should've lent my name to this fiasco. Yes. Miss Rennick, would you call her for me? Call who? What are you talking about? Garbo. Miss Garbo. Yes. She gave me this ring. It's real gold. Oh, it was very generous of her. Well, considering that she still has the first nickel which she ever made. You know the flea market on Sixth Avenue? Well, you might look for her there. She always loved a bargain. (GASPS) You're... I'm sorry. That's solid sterling. $175. MAN: Hey, did you see her? Did you see her? WOMAN: Isn't that... MAN: I don't know. I think it is. (CHATTERING) Can I have a minute of your time, please? I'm not a reporter or anything. It's about my mother. You've gotta listen to me, please. My mother is very sick. She is at New York Hospital, room 808. She has a tumor. She doesn't have much time. She has no time. The doctor does not think she will last the week. She has this crazy wish. She wants to meet you. I have been looking for you for three months. She just wants to see you before she dies, that's all. She just wants to look at you. I don't know, just see you. Please. Please come with me. Just a few minutes, that's all. Five minutes. One minute. Please. There's not even time to think about it. She loves you so. She loves you, maybe even more than me. That's her. I can't believe it. It's really you. It's you. If I'd have known, I would've... I would've had my hair done, had somebody give me a manicure. You met my son? He's a good boy. He works very hard. I don't know what to say. I mean, you're here, I don't have words. Must be 30, 40 years. Oh, I bet people have told you this till you're blue in the face. I've loved you ever since the first time I ever saw you. We were living on Eastern Parkway, that's in Brooklyn. My father gave me 10 cents to go to the movies with Wanda Sternhagen, my girlfriend. My father didn't have much. Ten cents was a lot of money to him. He had six mouths to feed. We saw Flesh and the Devil. Your name was Felicitas von Kletzingk, remember? What a name. I never forgot it. It stuck in my head. You know, movie names don't usually stick in your head. There I was in the balcony of the Loew's Pitkin, with Wanda Sternhagen in Brooklyn and I was Estelle Garbo, eating a corned-beef sandwich out of a brown paper bag and Wanda kept saying, "Shh," because the brown paper bag kept rattling. It's easy being Estelle Garbo when you're in the balcony of the Loew's Pitkin in the dark. Nobody could see my double chin and my huge bust. Not like yours. Nice. I shouldn't have been eating a corned-beef sandwich, anyway. I was a fat kid. I needed to lose some weight, but show me anything from a delicatessen, especially corned-beef. You had me in the palm of your hands. Every time you moved, I sighed. You walked from one end of the room to the other, it was as if your feet never touched the ground. Wanda and I saw every movie you ever made. She thought I loved you because I had big feet, too. It's true. I wore size 10. I was only going on 12 years old. Wanda moved away. Her father got a job in Trenton. Before she left, I took her to lunch and a movie. We went to see a revival of Wild Orchids. We sat through it four times because we didn't know how to say goodbye to each other. I wrote you a letter once. I never wrote to any other movie star. I didn't get an answer. That's all right. That's all right. I didn't take it personally. You know, you're not gonna believe this, but it's true. I married my husband in 1953. It was a small wedding. It was in the house. My mother cooked for a week. My aunt cooked for a week. Everybody came. Then, afterwards, Walter and I took the train to Atlantic City. That was our honeymoon. Some honeymoon. Two nights. I didn't plan things right, you know? Female times. So there we were in Atlantic City and I couldn't do anything. I was a virgin. Walter was a virgin. We had to stay that way a little while longer. We didn't have anything to do. So, I bought a newspaper. Anna Christie was playing. It was the only movie of yours I hadn't seen. Garbo talks. "Give me a whiskey. Ginger ale on the side. "And don't be stingy, baby." Walter and I had Gilbert. I named him for John Gilbert. When I came out of the delivery, I was so exhausted, I could hardly move. I could hardly even open my eyes. The TV was on. They were playing Camille, and all I kept looking at were those heavy skirts of yours going back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. Walter and I got a divorce. World's a crazy place to live in, isn't it? He thought I was eccentric. Day I came home from the lawyer's, I cried all day. I walked around the house all day. I couldn't find a place to sit. I took three baths. I don't know. You love somebody, you have a child, and then it's over. Why? I don't know. It's crazy. I turned on the TV. They were playing Queen Christina. That close-up of you at the end, I thought it would never end. I mean, it just went on and on and on. Oh, God, how I hated you. I really hated myself. I thought if I looked like you, if I had that face, if I had those eyes, I wouldn't be so alone. And those arms of yours, those long, thin arms that go on and on and on forever like as if they're never gonna end. I would've been jealous of anybody pretty that day. Just your luck they were playing Queen Christina. You care anything about basketball? The Knicks are out of the playoffs. I'm not entirely happy about that. World is full of little injustices. They either bother you, or they don't. Me, they bother. You know, a couple years ago, I saw a picture of you in a magazine. You were in Paris. You were walking in a park in a black hat. I bet you got a million hats. I went to Paris. Twice. You got nothing on me there. Of course, you were with Aristotle Onassis. And I was with the B'nai B'rith tour. Oh, Gilbert. Gilbert, Gilbert, Gilbert. Oh, God, Gilbert! You know what she told me? She told me that her father was very poor, just like mine. He worked in a factory in Sweden. He made auto parts. And she loves delicatessen, only she likes cold chicken better than corned-beef. And what else? Oh, she hated biology. She hated biology. And, God, how I hated biology. And I can't remember everything else she told me. We had such a good talk, Gilbert. She told me that she was born in September. I was born in September, you know that, don't you? And she told me that her living room is red. Her living room is red, Gilbert. And what else? What else? What else? Her living room is red and she hates war. She hates anything about war and violence. Damn it. But anyway, she said that we were very much alike. Except for the feet. You know she hasn't got big feet at all. She wears size 7AA. She showed them to me. Well, she sure got it all over me there. I'm very busy now, Gilbert. I have to talk to you, Mr. Plotkin. Later, Gilbert. I have to talk with you now. Shepard, I'm leaving. I am not saying this because I am upset. But yes, I am upset. Of course I'm upset. I am very upset. You took my office away and you gave me a depressing little room. It's not your fault. I allowed it to happen. The light fixture buzzes. There's a dull hum all day long. You know. You wouldn't fix it for me, no matter how many times I asked. It's okay. You reduced the staff, and you gave me enough work for three people to do. And if I didn't finish, I got that speech about consolidating my time. Don't worry about it. It is not your problem. I sat there and I listened. Didn't I? You deducted a half-day's salary because I was late. No problem. I allowed it to happen. You made me come to work at 6:00 in the morning. There was nothing to do at 6:00 in the morning and I said to myself, I said, "Plotkin is enjoying doing this to me." But then I said, "No. Rules are rules. "The man is only doing his job. "That's okay. A man has to do his job." You've been great. You really have. I wish you the best of luck. I'm not angry. I have no resentment. You've been great. But we are who we are. I am who I am. You are who you are. So, go fuck yourself, Shepard. (DOOR CLOSES) JANE: I got the part. GILBERT: Yeah? Great. Yeah. They kept calling me back and calling me back. I thought they'd never make up their mind. Great. Great, great, great. I quit. You quit? You, too? Yes. I can do better. I think I can do a lot better. What are you gonna look for now? I don't know. The sky's the limit, though. I'd like you to come to opening night. Sure. They're going to talk about my Rosalind for years. I'm going to be the best Rosalind that anyone has ever seen. You already are. Gilbert, you're not part of my world. My career consumes me. I mean, there's just no time for a relationship. You understand that, don't you? Oh, sure. Good. I mean, maybe I'm denying myself, but, boy, acting is so full of sacrifice. Every day, I give up something for my art. You're simpatico. I really like that. Oh, I'm famous for my simpatico. (LAUGHS) I don't know what it is about you, but you make me laugh. You're so off-center. I love it. Oh, my God. Gilbert, do you know who that is? Oh, it's Greta Garbo. Oh, my God, she's coming this way. Oh, Gilbert, I can't look, I can't. How do you do, Gilbert? I'm fine, thank you. I don't believe it. Gilbert, you are something else.
