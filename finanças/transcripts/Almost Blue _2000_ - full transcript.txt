[Rain pattering] [Thunderclap] [Thunder rumbling] [Trumpet music playing] Man: ...Two, one two, three... [Camera clicking] [Playing jazz music] That's my boy. Holy shit, he's hot tonight. They're gonna pay pretty for this, man. Are you getting this? Shit, you gotta be getting this, man. Go, go, go, go. Ho, jump on it, jump on it, Morris. Jump on it, man. Whoo! [Music continues] [Cheering and applause] See, there's this delicate thread, this wire, that everything balances on. The hotter you get, the higher you go. And it doesn't matter how high you take it, 'cause it's all a house of cards anyway. Inches might as well be miles, because it can all come crashing down. Personally, I think it has to do with the heat. Really. [Muffled screaming and grunting] Save me! [Man screaming] -Please don't let me go. -I won't. -No! -Lorraine! God, no! Lorraine! [Jazz music playing] [Cheering and applause] Man: One, two, one two, three... [Jazz music playing] No wonder he doesn't leave this house. These damn steps will kill you. Morris! Time is running out. [Music continues playing] Morris, open the door. Morris? Shit. Turn down the damn music. Morris. Turn down the damn music. [Knocking at door] Turn down the goddamn music. [Knocking] Turn down the goddamn music! Turn down that fucking stereo! Excuse me. Morris, will you open the goddamn door? Very funny. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. You just love making an ass out of old Charles, huh? Look, Morris, the world does not applaud silence, and the products, they do not sell without music, and we don't get paid for not coming through. So, forget the tape. I'm here for the jingle. They want it tomorrow. Are you listening to me? No. [Chuckles] Charles: Jeez. I said, are you listening to me, Morris? I don't want the tape. Although let me remind you for the one hundredth time that it is not yours to keep. The record company owns it. Along with your white butt. Morris: I'm a busy man today, Charles, I got shit to do. Charles: Well, forgive me for wasting your valuable time. Here I am, thinking I'm doing you some kind of favor, throwing work your way, keeping your pitiful ass alive, when all the while, you just... [Plays saxophone loudly] [Yells] All the while you're just laying around here... [Morris continues playing] [Yells over the music] Working your fingers to the bone, lying in bed. Listen, my little wonder, you used to have it but no more. You said it yourself, all that music's done. All of that talent, all of that magic gone. Mmm-mm. But you do have something left, not much, but something. And that something's my end... okay? -Yeah. -Yeah. Look, you're not responsible for the big time stuff anymore, Morris. All you gotta do is a little jive time jingle. Thirty fucking seconds, that's it. You think you can fit that into your hectic schedule? Well, Charles, if you get the hell out of here, I'll start working on it right now. All right, I will. You not jiving me? -No, I'm not. -Okay, come on, outside. -I got something I want you to see. -All right. All right, come on, baby. Oh, Morris, don't Jack me around. -Morris, it doesn't have to be like this. -[Doorknob rattling] Morris? Now, get out of here, Charles. I told you I would do it and I'll do it. Come back in a couple of days. Morris: Go on. Hmm. Fine. Hell, man. You used to have "it" but the magic is gone, baby. [Morris] Just do it. Why should I do something when I can make myself happy not even playing one single note? I think the problem is people are cursed with too much time. So they say, "just do it." "Fuckin' do it." "Work out, buy shoes, "quit your job, get a better job." And then they try to tell you that Patience is a virtue. Well, who has time for that shit. It's all about waiting, isn't it? Well, that's what I'm doing. I'm waiting. I'm waiting for another drink. Waiting for her. I'm waiting. [Man playing steelpan] Hey, learn your scales. Learn your scales. Morris: And then forget 'em. Hey. You definitely still are the man. And you're still playing it cool and cute. Where have you been, man? What have you been doing with yourself? Oh, me? I'm... Looking for the music. You know well where the music's at. I haven't seen it lately. I don't know. I've been... I've been writing some bullshit jingles, you know, for TV. Commercials. Making a little pocket change. Hey, man, everybody got to make a livin'. -Lost what you had... -I did play once. I mean, I tried to play. I got up and... Played once but... It wasn't the same or something. Slipped away. Slipped away into the ozone. I still... I still got my tape. Oh, man. You got people running around here in cars, shaking down houses, playing tapes. Why don't you play your horn? 'Cause I ain't been using it. You can have it if you want. But let me have your wings. Maybe I can use 'em to... Fly away. Hey, baby, this is all I got. Except for this suit. You need a place to crash? Shit, man. I got a million places to crash. I'm just saying you know where I'm at if you wanna... come up. Four flights up. My door's always open for you, you know that. [Mutters inaudibly] You haven't forgot your scales yet. [Chuckles] I wish I had a camera, so I could take a shot. Learn your scales, man. -Learn your scales. -Listen, man, I'm gonna go. Then forget your scales. I'll see you. Still trippin' on the bassists. Morris: Don't get too close to the sun, icky. So, you hit the ground, and if you're lucky, it's over. 'Cause if you survive, you have absolutely no desire to get back on that wire. Hm. And you tell me what's worse. Being dead and not getting buried or getting buried and not being dead. Hey, hey, hey. They both may be attractive to a man who may have accidentally killed his own muse. [Woman laughing] [Overlapping voices] -[Woman screaming] -Morris: Lorraine! [Thunder rumbling] [Rain pattering] [Music playing outside] [Woman vocalizing and laughing] -Gimme. -Hey, gimme that. [Indistinct chatter] [Long-haired woman continues singing] [Short-haired woman laughing] [Singing along to stereo] -Hey, we have an audience. -Who's the audience? ♪ Thought I saw you in my room ♪ on TV ♪ fucked all night and fucked till dawn ♪ didn't we?[Giggles] ♪ What's your story, morning glory? ♪ Tell me your love's for free[Yelps] [Indistinct singing and laughing] ♪ What do you want from...[Yelps] Hey, what's your name? Darcy. What about you in the red shoes, what's your name? Jasmine. What? It's Jasmine! Hang on, I'll be right back. This one's for you, Jasmine. What about me? [Plays somber tune] [Continues playing] [Stops playing] You son of a bitch! I sing you a song, and you play for her? Ugh! How rude! Maybe this will get your attention, huh? -[Gunshot] -[Shrieks] See me now? Now you see me. Morris: Oh. [Chuckles] You see me, huh? Darcy: Now you see me, huh? You see me? Put that gun away, you crazy little wildcat. Are you okay? -[Gasps] I think he liked my song. -We'd better go. That was lovely. Was it really for me? [Rapid groaning] [Groaning] Shit. Man, you're supposed to have another month. -Oh, my god. -We gotta get you to a hospital. -Get me a drink. -Yeah, right. A drink. I could use a little help down here. Morris: Not unless your girlfriend's out of bullets. She's having a baby for crying out loud. I wanna get her some water. We're gonna come up. Buzz us in. Okay. No, no, no. Wait a second. Stay there. I'll call you an ambulance. I don't care what you do, just hurry up! How's she doing? [Groans] -What the fuck are you laughing about? -False alarm. You bitch. -Come on, let's get a drink. -Oh, you bitch. Hey, you play a pretty mean tenor. Ever thought of quitting your day job? Jasmine: Why didn't you fucking tell me the gun was loaded? -Operator: ...Emergency. Hello? -What? -Are you in trouble? Hello? -Uh, I'm sorry, no. Darcy: Hey, let's go to the cruise room. You're buying, right? [Women giggling] You never know what's gonna happen next. You think you got something licked and then something else happens. But you keep working on the music, giving it a lot of thought, a lot of time. You keep figuring out the notes and trying to get body and mind of the work as one. Then all of a sudden, your solo comes.[Chuckles] And you can't rely on the charts or the other players. You just have to get up there and wing it. Yeah, it's sort of like walking a tightrope without a net. At any time, you... might... Fall. I followed you. Hey, lots of nice music made in this old building. Charles, what do you say? Oh, I've been better. I hear you cleaned up. Off the junk. [Chuckles] I wanna talk to you. I am here to offer you a deal. Looks like you could use some money. [Sniffs] And a bath. You, uh, talked to Morris, didn't you? [Chuckles] I want you to get him to give me the tape. Man, what is this nonsense shit you talkin'? You know what I'm talkin', man. Manhattan, the final gig. Icarus! The record company owns it anyway, icarus. And once the record company gets it, man, there'll be more royalties for you. Royalties, which you can kiss goodbye once they cancel the contract. Mm-hmm. It'll happen, too. The way he keeps holding on to that tape, like it was his mama's nipple! Just think of it, icarus. Money do... For me and you. [Laughs] I like that. Money do for me and you. [Chuckles] Yeah. ♪ Money do for me and you[Humming] And, oh, yeah, I got him another job, writing. And if he takes it, I can release the tape at the same time, and launch a whole new career for you guys. I'll be in touch. Who is it? -Jasmine. -Jasmine? Yeah. Jasmine. I've brought you your saxophone. Um, I found it in the street. Morris: Where's your friend with the gun? I'm alone. And I'm clean. Boy, you can say that again. [Sniffles] Just drop it and leave. Maybe I could come in. Or maybe not. Well? Look, just drop the horn and go. Hey, come on. You think I should? Well, I don't know. You look pretty good through the peephole. Do I think you should? I don't know. You think you should? -Yeah, I think you should. -Or maybe I shouldn't. Well, I'm not gonna hurt you, if that's what you're worried about. Come on in. I think I should go. [Morris clears throat] Look, it's your idea to come in, okay? I mean, make up your mind. I mean, do what you're gonna do. The door is open, all right? What do you think I should do, really? Look, it's your idea. You're the one that said that you wanted to come in, so do what you're gonna do, okay? But I think you should come in. See, no weapons. No blood. So, what's your name? Morris poole. Nice place you got here, Morris poole. Yeah, I got a lot of floor space. Yeah. What are you looking at? I'm looking at you. -You remind me of somebody. -Me? Really? You know my friend Darcy, the one that shot at you? Yeah, fuckin' nut. She didn't mean it, you know. She was just... She's going through this phase in her life, you know? She gets kinda worked up over things. Well, I suppose I should be grateful that it affected her aim. Yeah. Jasmine: Ah, it's gonna be another hot one today. You want something to eat? Some... -Eggs? -Yeah, okay. So, do you paint? No. Somebody else did those. [Eggs sizzling in pan] So, what do you do? I dance. I'm a dancer. Well, you got the body for it. You're a saxophone player, huh? Buck teeth, fat upper lip. Beer belly. Buck teeth? [Mutters dismissively] [Snickers] I ain't got no big belly. Jasmine: [Sarcastically] Mm-hmm. Want some of this? No, thanks. But thanks for last night. That was really nice. Well, it's been a long time since somebody said that to me. Oh, well. Been a long time since I played that way. Yeah? How come? I don't know. I've been a little bit out of my head for a while. Could have fooled me. I got a tape. I want you to hear it. It's of me playing. You think that was good, the other night, wait till you hear this. This tape. The fuck's my tape? Charles. Charles, you motherfucker. Son of a bitch! Jasmine! Guess she didn't like my cooking. Darcy: What if I were you, I'd play in the club. -[Man laughing] -What are you laughing at? -Can I play the tenor? -[Man continues laughing] Yeah. Gorgeous fucking tenor sax turns me on just thinking about somebody playing it. Darcy, you are the most outside women I know. I mean, you probably could have been a musician. I mean... -You got the balls for it, you know what I mean? -Oh, yeah? -Mm! -[Chuckles] Me and the musician, birds of a feather. To the survivors. Hey, hey, hey, are you here again? Why don't you go take a hike? Hey, I'm on it. Fuck off, waterboy, can't you see I'm having a conversation? -Hey, look... -Jesus. Terry, she doesn't have any money. She's whacked out on something, and we don't need her type here, right? And what type would... What type would that be, fuckface? Come on, Darcy. You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses now, would you? Hmm? -[Growls] -I'll take care of her. -Go on behind the bar. -Fine. You got customers coming in here in a little while. Great. I think I'm gonna be sick. She's got no money, man. What is it with you anyway? Haven't I seen you somewhere before? You know, you're one of the most outside women I know. Probably could have been a musician. Jasmine: [Clears throat] Your door was open. I'm sorry about the other day. That tape means a lot to me and... When I couldn't find it, I just went fucking nuts. Well, I didn't like the way we left off either, you know? Besides, you got interesting eyes, Morris poole. I saw you'd left... Ever since then I've had this melody in my head. Wanna play it for me? -Yeah. -Yeah? Yeah. Come here. Come on over, come on. I'll play it for you. -Really? -Yeah. Come on. -Yeah? -Yeah. How many times I gotta tell you? [Giggles] Not too many. This is kinda pretty. [Plays tune on piano] You like that? Yeah, I like that. I like it a lot. -You want a drink? -Yep. -You sure? -Yep. All right, don't mind if I do. I live here by myself. I don't like it that way, but I'm... I'm used to it. Nobody gets used to living alone. -Wanna bet? -Yeah. Do you do this all the time? Do what? Uh... hang out with washed-up musicians. Oh, never with washed-up ones. So you can relax. Is that a compliment? -No. -[Plays piano] You wanna learn this? Play me. All right. -What is this, multiple choice? -Yeah. I'll take this one. Go ahead. All right. [Plays piano] [Plays off-key note] Hey, come on! This is a lesson here. What are you doing? Learning. [Plays piano] [Plays off-key note] Come on, I can't do this. -No? -No. It's like you're learning too. What am I learning? It's okay. [Rain pattering] [Noises stop] Why'd you turn that off? It's time to wake up. All right. I think you should stick around for a while. Why don't you stay? -I think you should. -Oh, yeah. Maybe. 'Cause, like, I have to get up and... Start working on this jingle. Told Charles I'd give it to him. -Jingles, huh? -That's how I pay the rent. Why don't you just cut an album? I mean, there's a lot of people out there that'd be... Real happy to hear your saxophone. Never heard of me before, did you? Morris poole. I used to be... Pretty big. Once upon a time. But playing the saxophone and writing jingles are two different things. Right now, I'm making money and that's what I wanna do. What a sellout, huh? It's all about mo' money, mo' money. -Hmm? -Look at it this way. Uh, this thing that I'm doing, it's about Espresso. Instant Espresso. I write this little theme, millions of Americans across the nation listen to it, and then they buy the shit. They get all cranked up on it. So what? It's power. [Giggles] Bullshit. Come on. It's not bullshit. It's not bullshit. It's what I'm doing. And I got to have it done. By noon. What time is it? [Plays piano] [Doorknob clicks] [Indistinct muttering] [Morris continues playing piano] [Laughs] [Indistinct singing] [Knocking at door] Hmm. Goddamn it, Charles. This door doesn't open until I get my tape back. [Laughs] I love that joke! Look, I got some good news. Fuck the jingle. [Laughs] How about that? -Come on, let me in. -No. Oh, there's a film. They need a composer. And they want you. Can you believe it? They actually asked for you by name. Except there's a slight catch. Uh, it's a rush job. The stiff that they hired first backed out with three weeks left on the job. And when they started throwing around your name, why, it was like old times, you know. So, anyway, I told them that I would talk to you. Well, you shouldn't have told them that, Charles. 'Cause I don't do that shit anymore. Charles: Uh, Morris, it would mean a turnaround. It would mean a new start to everything. It would mean no more jingles. Quit the self-pity shit and get on the ball for both our sakes. Hey, what are you talking about, self-pity? I don't have any self-pity. I just don't do that shit anymore, and that's the end of it. -I want my tape. -You don't get it, man. This is a lot of money, Morris! I want my tape. Morris, if I had the tape, would I be standing here like a fool begging you to take this job? Well, how long do I have to pull off this miracle? Like I said before, you got three weeks. Three weeks? Are you fuckin' nuts? It's going to take me three months to write a score like that. Baby, haven't you heard a word I said? They know you're good. Shit, man. I know you can do it. -Come on, let me in, man. -I know you can do it. Yeah, you can. Well, get out of here, Charles. Uh, think about my percentage for once. Things aren't working out so rosy for me, either. And if this film works out the way they think, it could make six figures for us, Morris. The beauty part of it is we would fulfil our contractual obligations to the company with it. You could keep the fucking tape. Who is this guy? -He's my agent. -Your agent? Yeah. He's not a bad guy. We had a lot of fun times together. Gotta start somewhere. Okay, Charles. It's a good figure. You tell 'em I'll do it. All right. [Upbeat music playing] [Inaudible] [Inaudible] Icarus: It's funny. The time it takes for me to say this, the time it takes for the ears to hear, is more than enough time to finish the thought. Up... And down. You know, things are different now. Yeah. Sure is. And don't go believin' them cats that say it ain't. It's just that after all the time passes, things move on. Nothing is the same anymore. Right. Well, anyway, like I was saying, we could really use you guys tonight. Tonight? Definitely. Hey, but my friend is gonna have to borrow a horn. I'll buy you a drink. Hey, barkeep. Two... What are you drinking? Nothing, Charles. I'm just waiting. Just sitting... and waiting. All right. Just give me a Jack. Uh, I hear you're sitting in tonight. Man, I can't pass up a chance to play with them young cats. Good. Then you're bringing my main man Morris. Yeah, he'll be here. Great. He took the job, you know? He's writing again. And, if you can get him to play, icarus, then we are on the right track. And, oh, yeah, he mentioned that the tape is gone. You sly motherfucker, you just waltzed right in, and... Man, that's his thing. It reminds him of his other life. That's just a excuse to keep him from writing. Look, man. I know you got the tape, okay? Don't you be getting no ideas about holding out on me, man. Don't get no ideas, you're better that way. [Man clears throat] Hey. My man! Man: Look, sorry I took so long, but we're setting up for tonight's gig right now. This thing's pretty old. So, I hope he's still got some chops. He used to be good. Good? Man, don't hand me that shit. He's great. You take care of them skins. He'll take care of this horn. Man, at least it ain't held together with rubber bands. Of course I remember the time when a cat would come around and open his case, pull out a horn with rubber bands, everybody would pack their horn up... [Steel pan music playing] [Music stops] [Indistinct chatter in the background] One minute, please. -Can't you see I'm on the phone? -So? -What is your problem? -I wanna talk to you. -Talk to me about what? -I wanna talk to you about what you were talking about earlier. Oh yeah? -Yeah. -He knows about the tape? -Mm-hmm. -I'll call you back. Come on, mama. Let's talk. [Playing piano] Instant Espresso picks you up. -All you need is just one cup. -I'm gonna have to start locking that door. Oh. [Giggles] I'm busy here, and this has nothing to do with instant Espresso, okay? -So, get out of here and leave me alone. -Can't you take a break? Come on, I got a rehearsal in a couple of hours. Take a break. -Don't you have a job or something that... -Yeah, I got a job to go to. -That's why I want you to go on a break with me. -I don't wanna take a break. Look, I got three days to finish this. You understand? -Three? -One, two, three. Oh, just for me. Chick, get lost. Leave me alone. Ooh. What is this? Hmm. I like the other stuff but with a catchier tune. ♪ Instant Espresso picks you up [mumbles indistinctly] -See the door over there? -Yeah. Why don't you use it? I have to finish this. Bye. Bye. I need an ending for this. It's... -You need a drink. -It's too fucking hot out here anyway. -Get out of here. -You need a drink. -Chill out. -Yeah, I do. I'm glad you're here. Yeah, well, now that I'm here... [Giggles] That's why you're so grumpy, you know that? -I ain't grumpy. What are you talking about? -Good stuff. Yes, you are. -[Mutters dismissively] -Yeah. -[Laughs] -Quit it. Hey, you really wanna help me? Maybe. Why don't you go over there and sit down and let me work out the ending of this, okay? And let me play it for you, see if I can figure it out. I'm having a... [exhales] -A what? -I'm having a block. -A block? -Yeah. I'm trying to... I'll get it, but just go over there and just listen to me play it. -I think I can do that. -Okay. How about that? See what a little-bitty break can do? -A little-bitty break? -A little-bitty break. All right, play it. Show me. -Come on. -All right, all right. [Playing piano] [Camera shutter clicks] Icarus: Hey, Morris! The time to play is at hand! Behold, gifts! The fairy godmother came down and laid them on me. Come on! Don't insult the bitch! Let's go have some fun. Hey, Morris! Let's go chase the bird! Forget about the ozone that leaves for the night. Hey, man. I need you to teach this beast to sing. She won't listen to me. [Plays off key] Must be broken. Sounds awful. -Icky? -Hey! [Toilet flushed] Man, I don't know if I can do this. Been a long time since I played in front of people, you know? Man, not to worry. Not to worry. Just do what comes. You know how it is in there. Yeah, right. I'll tell you what, man. Why don't we just forget about the whole thing? Looks like you already got a sax player out there anyway. You guys don't need me. [Burps] Bebop. You ever have those dreams where you're running around naked, on your way to work, you can't find your way home, stark naked? Yeah. This ain't no dream, it's a fucking nightmare. I don't feel good. I'm feeling funny. This ain't even my horn, man. Now you oughta know how that feels better than anybody else. I'm not fuckin' ready, man. I'm not ready. Hey, man, what's the matter with you? All you gotta do is stand up there and blow. Man, you know, it's not that easy. Come on, icky! What are you feedin' me that shit for? You know it's not that easy. I'm not fuckin' ready yet, man! Shit, man. I thought you was down with this. Oh. You wanna be cool. Feel sorry about your loss. Here! I was up at your place a few weeks ago. You weren't there. Only this! So, I started thinking about things. You know, things! So, I took it, to give you a chance for some peace of mind. Hey, you want to sit inside, feel safe, listen to your damn tape? Fine! But remember, I used to have a problem too. But I'm playing again. And that's the truth. Man, I gotta get out of here. Too hot in here. [Retching] [Spits] Sh... fuck. You must be with the band. [Clears throat] I guess so. -I know you, right? -Maybe. Yeah. You're... You used to play uptown. Poole! Mr. Morris poole. -Hey, man. -I used to be him. You were pretty good, man. Well, where have you been? Overseas or something? Or something. So, you sitting in with the band tonight? -How about that? Yeah? -That's what they tell me. Thanks, man. Your comb, here. Fix yourself up. Thanks. I look like shit, man. Look at this fuckin' shirt. Hey, nothing a good mouthwash won't cure, right? Gotta look like wynton, you know? I don't know who the fuck that is but if you got a coat for me I'd appreciate it. Hey, Terry's got a coat. Great. Go get it. Okay. Here's your comb. Thanks. Hey, how many times I gotta tell you to go fuck yourself, huh? Son of a bitch. [Indistinct chatter] -Come on over here, I wanna talk to you. -Hey, Terry. -I want to talk to you. -Terry. Take off your glasses, let me take a look at your face. -Terry, could I borrow 50 bucks please? -What do you got in the bag? -There's nothing in the bag. -Are you packing? -No, I'm not packing. -How do I know that? -I'm not packing. -Let me see what's in that bag. There's nothing in the bag, Terry. How do I know there's nothing there? -You're carrying something on you. -No, I'm not. [Indistinct arguing] Is there a problem here? There's no problem here. He's the one with the problem. -You want me to throw her out? -Wait a minute, I'll be right back. Mm. Hey, Darcy, Darcy. This is not a private line. Why don't you go back behind the bar and pour two-for-one shitty drinks? Hey, hey, hey. This is our bar, our rules. -No. -Your zipper's down. -Fuck you. I know about the fifty dollars... -Terry: Hey, hey, hey. How many times I gotta tell you you can't come to this place high? What is it with you? You can't do that shit in this place. -Not now, not ever! -What? What? What? What am I on? Just a little Sherry before dinner, that's all. -A little Sherry? -Look, I just wanna see the show. Just a little entertainment. Look, if the man says you gotta go, -I'm talking. I'm talking. -Then you gotta go. -You understand that? -I'm talking. -Hang on, man. -Let me talk. -She was lying... -Would you let me talk, please? -Gimme this shot. Gimme the shot. -Fine. Fine. Jesus. -Now, what's in this? -Nothing. There's nothing in there. -Right. -What are you doing? There's nothing in... Let me see what you got on there... Oh. Easy, easy. I got a precious cargo you're not giving me your precious cargo. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to introduce you to the Latin sounds of the collectives. Two-for-one drinks till 2 am. So, be generous. Big round of applause. [Scattered clapping] Look, sit down here and watch the show. -Would you? -Thank you, sir. Never mind this. [Man playing saxophone] Thank you. [Plays saxophone] [Music continues] [Inaudible] [Lorraine screams] Hey, Jasmine. I missed it tonight. I was there. I bet you didn't know that. I watched you, heard you. Told you you still had it in you. It all came back. You think it all came back, huh? I can still play, huh? So what? So fucking what? Five years ago I killed my wife. Everybody tells me it wasn't my fault. But I was the only one there. And I was the only one looking into her eyes. And I told her I wouldn't let go. But she just slipped away. And I couldn't help it. I couldn't fuckin' help it. I lost that spark... And inspiration. A reason to play. And all I got left now is myself, and... I guess I'd rather be dead. You know, I got up there tonight and I played. It's been five years since I played. But instead of making me feel good, it just made me feel bad. It just reminded me of... How I used to feel. That's good, Morris. -You think that's good? -Yeah, I do. God, you know how beautiful you are? You don't think I wanna kiss you... Touch you? Hmm? Be with you? Well, I miss her. Is that a bad thing? I just don't wanna let myself feel that way about somebody again. If something were to happen, I don't think I could take it. I'd rather die first. There's nothing to be afraid of, Morris. I'm here now. You found your muse, it's me. You didn't kill me, Morris. You're not capable. It was an accident, that's all. Unfortunate accident. You accept that and go on. [Indistinct voiceover, static] I got a little surprise for you. -All right. -Okay. Just stay right there. [Indistinct voiceover on TV] [Soft trumpet music playing] You know, I found this down at that little shop on the corner. [Music stops] [Soft trumpet music playing] It's a funny thing. When I put this song, I just... I can't resist dancing, you know? It's like all I wanna do for the rest of my life is dance. And listen to you play your music. That particular piece is off your first album. Do you remember? Surprise. [Birds chirping] Morris: All I want right now... Is to finish this composition. I've realized that... All I've ever wanted to be... Is what I play. When the muse visits, you have to let yourself go, and let her lead the way. I just don't know where she's leading me. Morris: Hey, baby. I feel pretty good today. [Chuckles] Remember the first time when you came over here and I couldn't find that tape, I went fucking crazy? Well, look what I got back. I don't want to listen to the past anymore. [Exhales] Oh, Jasmine, you don't understand. This is the best I ever was. This is when I was great. It doesn't get any better than that. You know, before I lost it. You lost it? Lost what? You play 'cause you can, not because somebody allows you to. Don't use me for this, Morris. Don't you see? I mean, this tape's just a crutch. It's a safety net. -Oh, is that what it is? -There's no such thing in jazz. [Clears throat] You don't think so, huh? No. -Wanna make a bet? -Yeah. You're the one that wants me to play again. You. That's not what I want. Not anymore, baby. I don't give a shit. I don't believe that. I got everything I need now. I got this. I got this. I got this. That doesn't mean shit and you know it. You're the creator, not the creation. I've lost everything, baby. [Laughs sarcastically] "I lost everything, baby. I lost everything, baby." You make up fuckin' excuses, you know that? What the fuck is this? Is that supposed to be me, huh? What is this shit? Sure you lost everything, but you didn't lose everything you thought lived for! [Overlapping sounds] -Huh? -Your music! You don't wanna play anymore because you just wanna fucking stay mad! That's all! It's your excuse not to get back out there. You know what I think? I think you're afraid to get back out there alone. All by yourself. So you use me for inspiration or whatever the fuck it is that you use me for! But don't bullshit me with your little love trip. At least have the courtesy to let me hate you for it. At least give me that. [Sizzling] [Rumbling] I'll give you something. How about this? You wanna burn up the tape? Is that what you wanna do? You wanna burn it up, wanna toss it into the fire? Here's the tape. You wanna burn it up? Come on! Toss it into the fire. Go ahead. I'll do it myself. Come on. Go ahead. Take it. Here you go. There it goes. You wanna do it? Huh? Go ahead, come on! You wanna do it? Then burn it up. Got all the answers for you. Go ahead! Toss it in! Come on, do it! Darcy: Hey, jazz-man. I wanna talk to you. You gonna talk to me? Well, I'm just a blind string-puller suffering from the heat. Uh-uh. You're the one I want. Come on! I know you have it. I want it. What you see is what you get. I don't see the tape. Yo, people would be very grateful to have poole's recording. I hear you got it. I had it but I gave it back. Look, I'm not really gonna shoot you. But I will if I have to. I just want the tape. Crazy woman. I did have the tape but I gave it back. Gave it back? [Blows raspberry] You expect me to believe that? Uh-uh. I was just told... No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Uh-uh. Don't try to confuse me. I ain't trying to confuse nobody. Now, I took the tape to help a friend. And then I gave it back. I wanted to help him kick a habit. You should try it. Yeah? Look, I got nothing against you. But I got obligations, you know? He's due any day now. I need the money to buy him the things he needs, yo. God! Things I had when I was a kid. Shit. This world doesn't need anymore heartbroken children. Heartache? You don't know nothing about no heartache! That kid is gonna have the lion's share of the heartache just having a crazy mama running around here, messing with that shit! What do you mean? I'll take good care of him. What do you mean "him"? Why you keep calling him a "him"? How do you know it's gonna be a "him"? It's a "him" because I want it to be. Besides, what do you care? Oh, I just wondered what you was gonna name him. He's gonna be a little tenor saxman. I'm gonna name him Parker. Parker? What kinda fucked up name is that? -If it was up to me... -Well, it isn't. I'd name him icarus. Icarus, where the hell did you get icarus? There's a lot of jazz greats named icarus. That's a good name for a girl, too, just in case. Icarus, huh? What, so you don't like Parker? Right? But I like Parker! [Gunshot echoing] Shit! You almost shot my bass! I'm sorry, it was an accident. Honest, I swear. -[Plays jingle tune on piano incorrectly] -[Trumpet playing off key] -[Trumpet continues to be played] -Do you mind? -Why don't you put that thing away? -[Continues to play] -Okay, the concert's over. -[Continues to play] What's the matter? Don't you like the sax? Or is it that you prefer the piano instead? Yeah, that's right. -You're driving me crazy with that thing. -[Plays trumpet] I can't work with you blowing that thing so put it away! [Thunder rumbling] [Rain pattering] [Plays trumpet] What's the matter, don't you like my playing? Don't you like me? Not at the moment. You haven't spoken to me all day. -I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. -You're sorry? -I'm sorry. -I'm sorry? That's it? I'm sorry? Fuck sorry. You know, you got a lot to learn about making up. All right, stop now! That's enough! -That's enough already! -Oh, what? Suddenly, you feel drawn? What's the matter? Lose your inspiration? Don't wanna deal with it? As usual. I really don't know what in the fuck you're talking about, j. What the fuck I'm talking about? I'm talking about you. I'm talking about what you expect from me, what you need from me. This isn't about love. Is that what you're trying to make it into? 'Cause Morris poole wouldn't give me that much. Oh, no. Not enough to call it love. [Thunderclap] What I need from you is to leave me the fuck alone. -Yeah, right. -Okay? -What do you want from me? -[Plays trumpet] Get that out of my face. What do you want me to do? Get down on my knees and kiss your feet? Crawl around the apartment after you and thank god everyday that you're here, helping me out and making my life better? -Nice. -I think you're a little bit confused about the difference between work and play, okay? Maybe I like my life just the way it is! -[Plays trumpet] -Hey, cut it out! Hey, cut it out! What the fuck do you want from me anyway, huh? [Morris chuckles] Hey, cut it out! Quit blowing that fucking thing. I'm not gonna tell you again. Charles: Hello, Morris! -Let go of my arm, Jasmine. -Charles: Damn it! -Look, I'm telling you, let go. -Give me... [Knocking at door] [Grunts] What's going on in there? Morris, op... Who's in there? Morris, can you hear me? Who's in there with you, man? Who are you hopping with? You stay away from me. Charles: Morris? Don't you hear me, man? Are you sick? What, you love these? Is this what Morris loves? You're messing around with those charts. Jasmine, don't fuck with my music. Gimme 'em. Music? [Giggles] This? And you said I didn't know the difference work and play. Well, you obviously don't know the difference between music and money! What are you selling with these, Morris? Huh? -Hey, cut it out! -Sellout. -You better stop fucking around. -Come on, Morris. Will you open the door, man? Please? I don't wanna be anybody's dead wife, Morris. I don't wanna be the inspiration for making money out of music, you hear? I wanna be part of your music. I wanna be part of you. Yes. Yes. You get it? -Gimme those. -[Knocking at door] Open the door, man. Goddammit. I'm coming in. Don't you get it? -Get away, Morris! -Jasmine, get away from the window. From the window? Obviously still a case of mistaken identity here. [Grunts] Get away from the window! But if this isn't for money, you must not need it. [Groans] -Morris: Let go of those papers. -Get away, get away. Let it go. [Morris laughing] Whoa. Whoa. -Wait a minute. My belt, my belt. -I'm slipping! -Grab the belt, man. -Grab the belt! Charles: Come on, man. Are you crazy, man? -Come on, grab on, man. Grab on! -Get out of here, goddammit! I know you're crazy, man. Grab the belt, man. That's not too good, man. [Morris laughs] [Overlapping chatter] Jasmine: That's not funny and you know it! -[Morris laughs] -Charles: Goddammit, man. Chin up and grab the belt! -No. -Grab the belt before you fall, man. Please, man. Oh, baby, I guess this is how I fell down. -Grab the fucking belt, Morris! -Morris, this isn't funny. -[Grunts] -What's the matter? Charles, worried about your percentage? That's a... man. Grab the belt, please. Please, Morris, this isn't too good. -Grab the belt! No. [Chuckles] Oh, shit. Come on, Morris. This isn't funny. Grab the belt! So, Jasmine, you wanna be closer to me, huh? You wanna be closer to me, baby? Come on out here. -Don't do this. -Do you love me, Jasmine? Hey, Jasmine. Tell me you'll stay with me. I will. You tell me you'll stay no matter what. Oh, Morris. What are you doing? [Soft jazz music playing] [Rain pattering] [Woman laughing] Icarus: Learn your scales. Learn your scales. [Indistinct chatter] Darcy: Look under d for Darcy. Sure it's there. Try icarus. He's with the band. What about Jasmine? Go figure. When it rains, it pours. So, what do you do if everything goes up in smoke? Shit, I wish I knew. Uh, maybe you just dream, and when it gets done, you wake up, and you just go back to work. In the end, you arrive back where you started. Balancing on that thin blue line, making it all up as you go the hell on. Heat does strange things to a man's constitution. But this cold? [Chuckles] Forget it.
