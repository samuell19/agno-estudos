Part One THE ORIENT EXPRESS DISASTER The Man in Black won the first round but Inspector Juve swore he'd win the second. Juve lists the criminal's crimes: Robbery of Princess Danidoff, murder of Lord Beltham, attempted execution of the actor Valgrand. And now, the Chaleck affair... Here, Jérôme, read my report. Report by Inspector Juve to the Chief of National Police. The female corpse found at Dr Chaleck's could not be positively identified as the victim was totally disfigured but she carried identification in the name of Lady Beltham, accomplice of the murderer Gurn who escaped prison on his execution day. Is it really Lady Beltham or a ruse for her to be believed dead? An enigma . Another enigma: How did the body end up at Dr. Chaleck's? He seems above suspicion because he immediately informed the police upon finding the body in his apartment, after being away for a few days. Lastly, the coroner could not determine the exact cause of death. The body appears to have been mangled. The investigation continues. Juve. Calm down, kid. Old Juve knows what to do. The next day on rue Frochot, as Dr. Chaleck exits his home... Tailing the Doc:tor's car, Juve and Fandor reach Boulevard de la Chapelle. During the trip, the elegant Dr. Chaleck transformed himself into a shady character. While Juve followed the ruffian, Fandor tailed the strumpet. My beloved Loupart, be at the train station at 3 o'clock with some henchmen. The old coot I told you about, Mr. Martialle, from Kessler & Barru Wines, will be carrying 150,000 francs. He's mad about me and believes me lily-white. That's why he wants me to go on the trip with him. Your Josephine. Another ruffian follows Juve... Fandor, luckier than Juve, hasn't lost the girl. METRO LINE 2 Dear Juve, I'm on the right track. The bird has returned to her nest and I'm on watch. Fandor. One hour later, the strumpet, transformed, exits her home. She goes to the train station to meet Martialle, wine merchant. As planned, Loupart's accomplices are waiting on the platform. Good idea to have chosen to last car, dear Joséphine . Here we'll be ideally alone... To what fate does this train lead Martialle and Fandor? In the unhitched car, Fantômas's gang may now operate at leisure. Fandor, dozing in the next compartment, experiences a similar misadventure. There was only one track, that of the Orient Express . And now the incline is causing the car to roll backwards. The Orient Express . Loupart's car awaits the crooks. Kessler and Barru, Wine & Spirits Mr. Bordier and Mr. Pontarlier: Following our discussions and to seal our partnership in the St. Blaise distillery, please receive from our representative 150 thousand-franc notes, cut in half. The other halves will be delivered in 30 days, after the contract's clauses have been honoured. Sincerely, Kessler & Barru. Loupart decides to get the missing halves from Kessler & Barru. But also to rid himself of his arch enemy. To Juve, National Police, Paris. All is well. To close the case, be at the Bercy warehouse, alone but armed, tomorrow night at 11 o'clock, near the Kessler wine cellars. Your friend, Fandor. The following night, Juve arrives at the Bercy warehouse carrying his trusty pistol. Fandor, expecting the bandits to come to Bercy to get the rest of the banknotes, is also there. Fantômas's gang sets fire to the barrels. Part Two AT THE “CROCODILE” A few weeks later, Joséphine, in the company of an American boxer, is popping the champagne at the Crocodile. Juve and Fandor, to relax their frayed nerves, had also come to enjoy a night out in Montmartre. But... It's the strumpet, Loupart's accomplice, the woman on the train. Allow me to introduce my friend Inspector Juve, National Police. Where is Chaleck? Answer me or I'll arrest you . A gentleman is waiting for you outside. And 10 minutes later... Part Three: THE HAUNTED VILLA Seeking to forget, Lady Beltham, Fantômas's accomplice from when he called himself Gurn, now resides in a convent in Neuilly. Lady, Do you still refuse to see me? Last night, I visited your empty villa and was shocked to find it up for sale. There, alone in the dark, I relived our past. Lady, I must speak with you. Meet me Wednesday at midnight in what was once your room. Gurn Wednesday, shortly before midnight, in the shadows of the garden. Again under his spell, she promises to return to the villa every Wednesday at midnight. One morning shortly after, two figures patrol near the villa. Pretending to be potential buyers, Juve and Fandor visit the house. This pen was used less than two days ago. Do you come here to do your correspondence, my friend? There's a light in this room each Wednesday. I think the house is haunted . Obviously. Ghosts come here every Wednesday to pen love letters . It's the heating vent for the furnace in the basement. The cistern for rain water. The following Wednesday at midnight. Lady Beltham arrives as usual. Without noticing Juve and Fandor, Fantômas closes the vent to block the cold draft. Yes, we'll run away together but in four days, when my silent executioner will have finally gotten rid of Juve . Four nights later, with Fandor's help, Juve prepares himself for the visit of his mysterious silent executioner. Shortly before dawn. The silent executioner. The steel spikes turn out to be ineffective. Help me, Fandor . Part Four THE MAN IN BLACK That morning, Fantômas daydreams of Lady Beltham in the garden of her empty villa. The cops want to finish him, but instead, he'll finish them . Informed of his presence, Juve orders his men to storm the villa. Listen . It sounds like breathing... The silent executioner. Farewell, men of justice.
