MISS OSAKA He was just typical Norwegian. He didn't think we should buy the Chinese modules. I got him persuaded and explained - - that the Norwegian modules are produced in Singapore. We'll talk about that at the meeting tomorrow. They will all be there. Yes. Apparently, it was a total agreement on the board. Yes... We'll get a signature at the meeting tomorrow. Yes. Exactly. All fine. Good, hey! - Good, your shoes! - Yes. What about your hair? Ines, come on! - We should be there in 10 minutes. - Yes. I'm hurrying. Please open again. I need to get rid of the top I'm wearing under my dress. - I'll wait downstairs. - Yes, I'm coming now. I'm so hungry. Maybe we should try to rent a boat? Yes. Cheers. Hi. Hi Lucas. Hello again. Hi. Maria, right? Yes. Who is the young lady? I'm the girlfriend of Lucas. And do you have a name? This is Ines. Ines, Maria. We meet in the elevator. She hates them just as much as me. That's right. We just ordered... Do you drink champagne? Of course. Do you want to have a glass? It's very good. Sure. Okay. Have a seat. Thank you. Did you eat? No, I haven't. Have you? We just ordered. Do you want to see a menu card? Okay... okay. Cool. Let's have dinner then. You have a very very lovely dress. Here you go. The menu card. Thank you. Your dress is really beautiful. Thank you. Most people actually don't think you can use solar power so far up north. But you know that the sun almost doesn't set all summer... Can I have another drink? So, you have the sun to fill in, when you are low of hydropower. Just the same. So, I put up trackers that follow the sun all day long, 360 degrees around. So, I can harvest the sun. Alright. So, Ines... Well... What about you? Are your here on holiday? No, I just came along with Lucas. He is here for work. And you? What are you doing here? A friend of mine he wanted to show me the Northern lights. But I haven't seen any for now, so I am not even sure of what it is. It is... Solar storms, that burns up through the atmosphere. But you have to be very lucky to see it. Wow... I like that. Where do you come from? I come from Osaka. Osaka? Wow. Have you been there? No. I always wanted to go to Japan. Always Japan. I have never been there. You have to come visit. Japan has everything. It's just endless possibilities. You will love it. Okay. Maria is not a Japanese name? My father is French-Canadian. In Japan I actually prefer Mimiko. I like the music here. Yes, it's good. Yes, it's like you can hear the Nordic spirits. Like you can hear the melting Italian sun when you hear Puccini's arias. You like Puccini? I love Puccini. Me to. I never think I have heard any of their songs actually. You do know, that Puccini's middle name is Maria, right? Cheers, Cheers. Giacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini. Maria. It's true. Deep asleep, it's now dreaming of itself. It's just resting here. It's like... Like this landscape you know... It feels like it was forgotten. People forgot about this place, and now it's just... lying here and falling asleep, dreaming about itself. Does it make any sense to you? Yes. Oh, blueberries! They are good for the memory. And the eyes. So, here my child. I don't know what I think of this place? I don't know if I like it or not? I never feel like this. Normally when I go to a place, I like it or I don't like it. But here it's different. This landscape has been forgotten. Deep asleep - - dreaming of itself. It just lies here. Silly you. Okay ready? Yes. Okay... Hi? Ready? Yes. Okay, Maria. Are you ready? I am ready. Yes! Do you have it? It was beautiful! Ah... Damn! - Are you siblings? - What? Are you sisters? What did he say? He asked if we were sisters. You are not going to be the next Björn Borg, I have to tell you. What about you? What about me? What do you do? I work in a club. Is it like a nightclub? It's like a place where you can just be whoever you want. It's a place of freedom you know. It's like a paradise. Paradise? It's a place for dreamers. It feels like a horror movie. Two young girls, and they are just walking around - - thinking, "It's safe here, there is nobody"'. And then there is one person who comes... Look at this! No, no... Ines! Oh no! Who would you be, if you could be anyone? Anyone? Yes. Elvis. Elvis? Really? Would you like to be Elvis Presley? "Ain't Nothin' but a Hound Dog". Wow! You walk like an angel. You talk like an angel. You walk like an angel. And I... You're the devil in disguise. Oh, yes, you are. Devil in disguise. Like an angel. Not like a devil. Cheers. Cheers. What did you do? That's a little impolite. What does it mean? It's like... we have a very different way of speaking in Japanese. Hold on, we must do something about this posture. Posture is really important. You need to stand straight. You always stand like... Like stand straight. Proud. You know, shoulders open. Good. You ask them questions, you know. People they want to feel important. They want to feel like, that you are interested in them. So, you ask them questions. A lot of questions about them. And they will think: "Ah, it's so easy to speak with her". You have to be interested, really interested. Really looking... really. Everything has to be real. And you walk... Like you are the only person here. And everybody is looking at you. Very gracefully. Don't look at me. Look into yourself in the mirror. Yes, like that. What's your tattoo about? You are going to think it's so cheesy. No, come on. It's a period in my life where I needed to feel free. You know, sometimes you have to do things that seems stupid to other people. But it helps you. They are perfect. Thank you. Are you afraid? No. Where is the road? The water is freezing. You have something... here. Come on! I don't understand Japanese. Very good. I'm going to miss you. When are you leaving? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Why do you stay with him? Stupid. Do not be so hard on yourself, Ines No, but that's stupid. I just dumped the guy who brought me here. I have a better man back home anyway, so... I bet he is madly in love with you. More mad than in love, the way he looks at me. Why do you look so sad? I like it when you smile. You are so cool. No, I'm serious, you are so cool. I wish you were my mother. No, I mean it. Why? Because you're so cool. Don't believe what you think you see. I can be whoever I want. I can be anyone but me. You know, we are so agitated all the time, thinking... about who we are. Who do we want to be? What are we scared of. And then there are these moments, when all these thoughts just go away. And you are there. You are actually there. And it's... magical. Maria? Maria? Help! Help! Ines? You may change the water temperature. Miss Osaka? Miss Osaka. It's over there. Move Mr. Yamaoka to another table. No.3, no.7, no.8... Are you looking for someone? What do you want? I want you to hire me. You look like a tourist. Foreigner. I live here. As hi ya to table 121. As hi ya to table 121. You get paid by the number of men who want to spend a time with you.

How nice. Good job, so. Smile, smile. Beautiful. Come again, will you? Yes! Straight. Stand straight. You're a pretty girl. Smile, smile anytime. Come back tomorrow. Do you believe she could have drowned herself? I think you ought to contact Maria. She was the last one who saw her. We're trying to get hold of her, but she's gone back to Japan. The passenger list confirms that. But now I'm asking you? After all, you're the one who knows her the best. Does she have any family, any friends, who know her better than you do? - Doesn't she have parents? - Yes. But she never saw them. She was very sad, because they never had time for her. I've never met them. Okay... Presuming that you're the one who knows Ines best. How would you describe her? Confused. Confused? About what? Herself. She is, she was, very insecure. How did you handle that? Probably not very well. Working as a hostess is like studying at university. You learn about society, you learn about people. All the people in the world. But why do they come? To dream. To live the dream. You are innocent when you dream. A hostess is a woman, who likes to fall in love. In love? Really? This will look good on you. You think so? I Know. Men like silk. “ "The Lady in Red". Whatever the man loves to do, you love that too. You share his passion. You want to open up the heart of the man. So you need to be able to talk about the things he likes. Cars, watches, fishing... Solar energy. Exactly! Good one. You take boring stuff and make it fun. You place your hand here. This is the soft spot. It works like magic. Confident? Yes. Very good. It's serious. It is very serious. Why? Because it's important. You are not afraid, you're defying them.

Heading for the northern sky where the snow is melting - - to find the dreams of days gone by. Get ready now. 3,000 yen. You know every time I meet a guy, and they fall in love with me, it's a matter of time before they get tired of me and then they dump me. What, they say like "I'm tired of you"? No, they do not say it. They are too afraid to say it. So it's just in your imagination. I mean, if someone is leaving you, it must be because they are tired of you. No, there could be a million reasons. I don't buy it. I've left many guys, and it was not because I was tired of them. Well, who so? Sometimes it's just not what you need. Not because of the person. It's but because you are in a period of your life, where you need to be alone. It could be that, you don't know. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Sorry. I'm sorry. I was just thinking about... something that I should not be thinking about right now. I feel like to telling you, Shigeru. I did something that I can't take back. Mimiko... I know her. Something really bad happened to her. She said something about wanting to swim in the northern lights. But it's all very blurry. I fell asleep. But I got the feeling that... and maybe she did not want to be here anymore. And I keep having this dream about the Northern Lights And that it took her, and carried her soul away in the night. I woke up and I found her shoes. And then I searched for her and found her. And she was dead. But I was obsessed with her, you know. Just like you are. After all, I don't even think that I knew who she was. I don't even think anybody knew... much about her. Get out! I don't want to see your face anymore. Out! Get out! Out! Get out! Stop! Stop it. Stop the car, goddammit. Hey, Mama-san. I'm not coming. I'm not going to work anymore, Mama-san. I'm sorry. Help! Help! I told you, that I like your smile.

You are not fake .. And you're so lucky.
