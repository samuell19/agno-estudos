You too. Move, and you're dead. (banging on glass) On the floor, down, flat on your faces. - No, no, please don't. - [Robber] Down granny, down. - You people, turn around, face the wall. Get your hands flat against it. Come on, move! - That's it, people. Keep it that way, and nobody will get hurt. (woman gasps) - [Robber With Machine Gun] Anybody else? - That's it, I've got it all. - Come on, let's go, move out. - Stay where you are. First one that moves gets it! (street noises in background) (tires squeal) (people coughing) - Police here, Sergeant Horn. - Hello, police, my name's Fisher, Martin Fisher. I'm a member of Asbot. There's something going on here at the International Bank in Hillbrow. It looks very much like a hold up. - Thank you, sir. Robbery, sir. - Bank robbery in Hillbrow. Get a message out to all cars immediately. - Control to all cars in Hillbrow area, be on the lookout for a late model two-tone blue and white sedan, registration number T-J-6-1-8-2-9. I repeat, T-J-6-1-8-2-9. Four male occupants are suspects in bank robbery at the Claim Street Branch of the International Bank. These men may be armed. (dog barks) - Bring in car 8-5 from Brontley. - [Control] Control to car 8-5, come in 8-5. - [Officer] 85 to control, receive you, over. - [Control] Proceed immediately towards Hillbrow. Suspect car may be heading in your direction, intercept. - Bring in car 3-0. - Control to 3-0. - Receive you control, over. - Proceed immediately to Barry Hertzog 3-0, over. - Proceeding to Barry Hertzog now, control. Get your foot down, Peters. - [Control] Be on the lookout for a late model two-toned blue and white sedan. - Look here, there they are. - They're heading west down Empire. We're in pursuit, Control. We're keeping a car between us, Control, using it as a shield until we're ready to move in. - [Control] Message understood, 5-3, car 3-0 in your vicinity. - There they are, sir. - Go Peters, after them. (dramatic music) - Heading north, Control, we've lost our shield car. (tires squeal) We're closing in now Control. We're going to overtake and try to force them off the road, over. - [Control] You've got them, 5-3, this is an easy one. - That's what you think, cop. Don't look back, boys. Just keep going the way you are. We'll have a hot surprise for them. Wait for it. Wait for it. Now! (gun firing) You did it, you beauty, you did it. - Get them, move in. - There's another one, Butch. (tires squeal) (dramatic music) (tires squeal) (man laughs) Get him! Hop the pavement. (gun fires) (guns firing) - Round the next corner, go! Louie. Louie. - Sorry chief, he's dead. (truck starts up) - Go on. Take the van and go and dump him somewhere. Somewhere well away from here. - Boy. What's wrong? - Louie, they killed him. - Oh, no. Louie, he's dead? - They blasted him down like a rat. He didn't have a chance. - Who did it? - A cop. I've got his face here, right inside me. That's one face I won't forget, never. - I'm very sorry, Boy. - Don't talk to me. Don't even open your mouth. - Look at this, Boy. Just look at this dough, man. - Louie's dead, don't you understand that, you meathead? Louie is dead! Who cares about this stinking money? And that killer cop, he's going to die one hell of a death. That cop, he's as good as dead already. - That's how they found the body of Louie Cronje, dumped out of a car. These are some of the people he's been associating with. Ben J. Larson, getaway car driver, three convictions, armed robbery. Con Cavallas, immigrant, seven years for assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, suspect in two murders, ex-mercenary, expert in unarmed combat. Rene Visser has been seen with Louie. I want you to find out what she's up to now, captain. - Yes sir, I've met her before, as you know. - Boy Jacobi. No convictions since he was 20. Plenty of case dockets on him, though. Acts respectable, but he's not. Suspected brain behind big robberies. Concentrate on those people. Investigate them. Find out where they were at the time of the holdup. This case has top priority. Leftenant Mayer was killed in that car chase. Constable Villemser is fighting for his life in hospital. When this sort of thing happens to anyone in the force, it becomes a very personal thing for all of us. We've got one of them already. (phone rings) Colonel Aucamp. (sighs) I see. Thanks for calling. Constable Villemser died on the operating table. That makes two murders. I want the men responsible. Get them. - Boy, Benjay said something about another job. Why so soon? - Yeah, it's going to be the biggest we've ever pulled, and the best. Him. Captain Nick Jansen. He's the man I want, and I'll get him. - He's the one who arrested my brother on that dope charge years ago. He was only a sergeant then. - He's had his last promotion. The next time they print his picture, he will be dead. - I know how you feel about Louie. I felt the same way when my brother was killed. - Your brother? He had only himself to blame, running away from the cops, falling off that roof. Louie was more than a brother to me. He was like my own son. Wait a minute. You say you know this Jansen character. - Well, he talked to me when my brother was killed. He tried to be nice to me. - [Boy] Don't get soft on the cops, Rene girl. They're all a bunch of scum. - This one was different. He tried to help me. - Maybe he had a personal interest in you. You're a pretty woman. - No, it wasn't that at all. - It could be. Maybe he could get interested in you, if you help him a little. - Help him? - Yeah. I've got an idea. Listen, Rene girl, why don't you go to this big deal hero, eh? Talk to him, be friendly to him. - [Rene] Talk to him, what about? - Your new boyfriend, nice guy, see. You're a bit worried about him. - What boyfriend, what are you talking about? - He doesn't exist. You make Jansen think he does. This guy maybe is getting involved into something silly, like uh, like the drug game, you get it? You remember how nice he was about your brother. Maybe he can help you with your boyfriend. Flatter him. You know the routine. - What's this all for? - You get him interested in you. You get him with his guard down. You set him up, and when he's set up, I kill him. I want to do it myself. (dramatic music) - Something wrong, guvnor? - I think I've got an idea to get to this cop who killed off Louie. Rene is going to be the bait. She knows this cop captain Nick Jansen. - Knows him? - But the cops might try something funny on her. Use her to get to me. Well so, Rene is soft. She might get the wrong idea about this cop guy. Suppose, just suppose they let onto her what really happened to that dumb brother of hers. - Mm, she wouldn't like that. If she knew the truth, she might turn. - So, we take no chances. Go and stick around, keep an eye on her. And if she tries anything silly, get rid of her, permanently. - Okay. - Very little, sir, we have very little on the Visser woman. May have been a beauty queen. - And the Boy Jacobi character, where does he get his money for the respectable front? - [Technician] He's taken up with Rene Visser. Birds of a feather. - [Nick] That needs a closer look. Rene with Boy, huh? (phone rings) - Hello? Yes, yes, he's here. I'll call him. For you, sir. - Thank you. Hello? Who? I see. Yes. Yes. I'll be downstairs in a minute. - What is it sir, trouble? - Somebody downstairs to see me, and you'll never guess who it is. Miss Rene Visser. - I don't think he knows what he's letting himself in for. He could end up the same way my brother did, drugs. - Just how do you think I might help, Miss Visser? - Well, you were so kind when my brother was killed. You made an impression on me. I thought, well, maybe you could tell me what to do with Davy. He's a very good friend. - You want me to talk to him. - No! I mean, I wouldn't want him to know I'd been to see you. I thought it'd be better if you could just talk to me. - Hmm, this boyfriend of yours, what did you say his name was, Davy? - He's not my boyfriend, just a friend, that's all. I don't have a boyfriend, captain. - Oh. - Can you help me, captain? Perhaps we could get together sometime. - If I can help, I'd be pleased to do so. - It would be my pleasure. Call me anytime, bye. (adventurous music) - [Nick] There she goes, follow her. - What did she give you the come on for, sir? - The lady's up to something, Peters. I'd like to know what it is. - She's uh, Boy Jacobi's girl, isn't she? - We know that. So why say she doesn't have a boyfriend? She wants to get me on my own for some reason. I'll give you odds Jacobi put her up to that. - No bet, sir. Why should I give you my hard-earned money? - She's going to see me alone a lot sooner than she expects. Not when she's rigged a trap for me. (adventurous music) Wait here, Peters. I'm going upstairs. (phone rings) - Listen man, I don't like this. When Rene left the cop shop, the law followed her up to her flat. - She wasn't supposed to bring in the law until I was ready for them. Stop her from talking. I don't care how you do it, just do it. - Alright. (knocking on door) - Oh. - Hello again. What about that little talk now. - Please, I didn't mean right now. I can't talk now. - You will talk, right now. (dramatic music) - You cops, you're all the same! Think you own the ruddy world. First you killed my brother, now it's my turn. - Now just a minute. What's this about us killing your brother? - Don't give me that innocent act. You know what I'm talking about. So my brother fell off that roof. He wouldn't have died if you weren't chasing him. - Where did you get that story from? - Don't try to snow me, Mr. Policeman, I know the facts. - Do you mind if I sit down? - Suit yourself. - Your friend Boy Jacobi, is he the one who told you? - You'd better get out of here fast. I've got friends, good friends. - Like Jacobi. He's the one who sent you to me, Rene. What for? What does he want with me? - Don't waste your time. - Now listen to me, Rene, and listen well. You don't have any boyfriend called Davy. You're Jacobi's girl. Ever since your brother was killed, you've been running wild. - Leave me alone! - But you don't know the type of person you're mixing with. We weren't chasing your brother when he was killed, somebody else was, somebody from the gang he was running with. And he wasn't killed accidentally. He was thrown off the roof. - [Rene] You are lying, it's not true. - We opened a docket on his death. It's still open. No evidence, Rene, but his body was too far away from the wall for him to have just fallen. He was pushed. Your brother wanted to get away from that gang, but they wouldn't let him. He knew too much. That's why they killed him. - Can you prove it to me? - I can show you the case dockets, all the facts. Photographs, medical reports. - You do that, prove it to me, and then I'll help you. - With Jacobi. - I can tell you plenty, if it was his gang my brother was with. If anyone gave the order to kill him, it would have been Boy. - I'll be back, with the proof. - Yes, come back. I want you to come back. - While I'm away, don't open this door to anyone. Bolt it, I don't want you to get hurt. - I'll wait. (dramatic music) - Well well, I think, I think you've fallen for a copper. Now that's not nice, Rene. No no no no, that's not part of the game. (elevator starts moving) Hear that? The lift going down. He won't be able to help you now, will he? Shame. (tsks) Naughty, naughty, naughty little girl. This reminds me of when I was a little boy. I used to pull the wings off butterflies when I was a little boy. Did you ever pull the wings off butterflies when you was a little ... (laughs) You're a real little tiger, aren't you? I like a girl with a bit of spirit. Makes it more interesting. Know what I mean? - Help, help! (dramatic music) Help, someone help! - Now you get it, love, just the way I dropped that brother of yours. (men fighting and grunting) (dramatic music) (man screams) - He told me, Nick. He told me he was the one who murdered my brother. - Four, three, two, one, go. (clock ticking) In position, jack it, go! - Jack operated, one, two, three, four, five, open! - Come on, lover girl, what are you waiting for, go. - Torch burning through steel door, allow one minute. - Move to the car, go! - In car, go. - One minute and ten seconds, plus one minute. I want those ten seconds knocked off during the actual hold-up. Two minutes should be enough. You must get more speed out of that torch of yours. I want this car repainted, and with new number plates. - Don't you think it's about time you told us what it's about? - It's diamonds, and it's soon, and it's big. The biggest. That's enough for now, get it? - Why, don't you trust me or something? - No, I don't trust anybody. - You're the boss. - Yes. - We've got to cover up Cavallas' death, sir, at least for the time being. If the papers print the real way he died, it's going to land Miss Visser in a tough spot. - What do you suggest, captain? - Tell the papers Cavallas was killed in a car smash. We're going to really need this Miss Visser. - Has she given any information? - Jacobi, Larson, Cronje, and Cavallas were the men responsible for the bank holdup. But we've only got her word for it. Not the kind of evidence that will stand up in court. But you've given me an idea, sir. - What about? - She says Jacobi is planning something really big within the next few days. If Miss Visser stays with the gang, she can tip us off in advance. - She'll be taking a devil of a chance, captain. - She has a very personal reason for getting back at Jacobi. - Make arrangements for me to meet up with this Rene Visser. (relaxed music) - Hello, you alright, weren't followed? - No, I made sure of that. I drove all over the place, came here the long way. - Good, this is Colonel Aucamp, Miss Visser sir. - I admire you, Miss Visser, you're very brave. We've got a plan, Miss Visser, but we need your help. - What do I do? - These are miniature radio transmitters. Send out a very strong signal, continuous beep, that's all. The idea is to fix them out of sight on the cars. - You want me to fit them there? - No no no, I'll do that. All you've got to do is to show us the vehicles they'll be using. - [Aucamp] Good, best of luck. - This is the place, alright. - [Rene] There's nobody here, I've already checked. - We'll double check. - We've got it, boss, don't worry. There won't be any slip. - There had better not be. This haul can put us on easy street for life. - Pity Con isn't in on this. You think Rene can handle her end? - What makes you think she's going to handle anything? - But you used her in rehearsal. - I want her to think that I still trust her. Do you believe this guff about Con being hit by a car? You think it was an accident? - Well, the paper said it was. - Rene's up to something smart with the cops, my friend. Con was too smart to get hit by a car like that. Two deaths that I'd like to make them pay for. Come on, let's go. (door opens) (loud clattering) Who's there? Come out with your hands in the air, move! - It's only me, Boy. Hang on, I'm coming. I dropped my torch. - What the heck are you doing down here? - Looking for my lipstick. I lost it in the car on the run through. - I'll get the torch. - Where is that precious lipstick of yours? - Here, why? Anything wrong? - No, nothing. Come on, I'll run you home. - Thanks. - This is the radio receiving van, captain. Let's just hope your transmitters are working properly. Well, is your little baby working? - Yes sir, perfectly, colonel. We've got transmissions on all three beepers now, coming through loud and clear. (three tones beep) By tuning in, we can locate their exact position, sir. They're stationary right now. Once they start moving, we'll be able to track them every inch of the way, sir. - You've changed the radio frequency in the cars, have you? - We won't fall into the same trap again. - Good. - All you men will be on standby. We'll block every possible exit from Johannesburg. We'll be able to follow their radio signals from the tracking van. You will remain in position until you receive radio messages to move. Car 87 here. - Yes sir. - Patrol Van 38 here. - Right sir. - Car 64, this intersection. - Yes sir. - Don't forget to bring Rex, sergeant, we might need him. - We'll be on duty sir, both of us. - You'll be on the Muldersdrif Road, captain, in case they go off that way. - Right sir. - Captain Fentor at Germiston Airport, waiting at the helicopter. - Yes sir. - That's it, men. Remember this. These are the men who murdered Mayer and Villemser. They must not escape. We don't know when they're going to move or where. But when they do, be ready for them. - Have you checked the acetylene equipment? - Working like a bomb. - How is it going, Benjay? - Fine. - Hey boss. Take a look at this. It's stuck under the car. Got some kind of a magnet thing on it. Mean anything to you? - Not a thing. Benjay. So, why the secrecy, what is it? - They call it a bleeper, a miniaturized radio transmitter. Effective up to a couple of miles. - Radio transmitter. You mean they can hear where we are? - Yes, they can trace that car from miles away. - Is that so. Joe. - [Joe] Yeah boss? - Check under the van and the other car and see if you can find any more of these gadgets. - Okay boss. - You thinking what I'm thinking? - Our little chum Rene. - Hey boss, this one was under the pantechnicon. Here, I'll check the car now. Here, there's something down here. It's another one alright. - That figures. Let's have it. - What are those things? - Presents from a well-meaning friend. Thank you. - Now look, if the cops are on us, we've got to call the whole thing off. - We call off nothing. - But boss, we can't take those things with us. They'll track us every inch of the way. And if we don't take them, the cops will close in anyway. We can't win! - Shut up, Benjay. The cops are going to follow those babies, but away from us. (dramatic music) - What? Tomorrow? (objects clattering) (dramatic music) (cat meows) (knocking on door) Oh, Nick. - I got here as fast as I could. What's wrong? Why couldn't you speak to me on the phone? - I was so scared. Just hold me a minute. - It's alright, Rene. It's alright, you don't have to be scared of anything. - That's better. I don't know, it just seems, I'm never afraid when you're around. Would you like a drink now? - No, not now. Well, come on Rene, what's it all about? You said it was important. - It is, very. I think the holdup's being planned for tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Why, did Jacobi say anything to you? - No, I did some snooping in his office. I was nearly caught in the act. I just managed to get away in time. - Hey, that's not in the script, girl. Nobody told you to do anything like that. If he found you snooping about, that would be the end of it. They're not playing games, Rene. They're cold-blooded killers. - But he didn't see me, so it doesn't matter now. But I found something, Nick. An air ticket, tomorrow's Alitalia flight to Rome. And it was just a single one. You see what I mean? - One? Did you see whose name was on it? - Of course, Boy's name. Mr. Jacobi. And it definitely wasn't a return ticket. - That means he intends leaving the country tomorrow, and he doesn't intend coming back. You're right, Rene. That sets the robbery for tomorrow. Don't do anything like that again, Rene. I don't want anything to happen to you. (tender music) - You really mean that, don't you? - Very much so. - Oh, Nick. - Listen, Rene, we've got the tracking van set up. When those cars and the pantechnicon start to move, we'll be ready for them. Nothing is going to happen to you. I'll make sure of that. - Are we hurling, sir? - That's right Peters, let's go. (dramatic music) - Get going. - Boy, why are you wearing the overalls? I thought Benjay was going to drive the pantechnicon. - There's been a change in plan. He's coming with you. You are going to drive the getaway car. - I don't understand. - Take good care of her, Benjay. - The best. Come on lady, we're going places. (electronic beeping) - Getting something now, sir. I think they're moving. Definitely, sir. Coming out of that warehouse. All three vehicles. - Control to all cars, prey moving, heading north on End Street. Start moving, stay well back, do not close in. (dramatic music) - Let's see what our friend the law are up to, eh? - [Control] Proceed to Delvers Street. Investigate shoplifting at UA Supermarket, over. - [Officer] Alright, Control. Proceeding at once to Delvers Street, over and out. - Heh, on the way to Delvers, and if they do spot anything, we'll know about it. (dramatic music) - Could be a long wait. - As long as we're in on the action, it's worth it. (electronic beeping growing faster) - You sure we're going the right way? - Just keep driving. - But surely we should have caught up with the others by now. - Don't talk so much. - Helicopter One to Control, come in Control, over. - Receive you Helicopter One, over. - Definitely no convoy or big pantechnicon, Control, over. - Tell him to keep searching. We'll confirm with the tracking van, and then get another car in that area to doublecheck. - They're moving now sir. All three transmitters transmitting. Funny thing is, they're very close together. They should be further apart. (dramatic music) (clock ticking) - Okay for traffic back there? - Nothing coming, boss, go ahead. - The convoy should be reaching your position any moment now, observe and report 3-0, over. - No convoy of any kind. That's Rene's car! Something's gone wrong, get moving. We are in pursuit, Control, but there's definitely just the one car. You must confirm position with tracking van. - There's just one explanation. That one car's carrying all the transmitters. - Radio Room, Colonel Aucamp. Tell Car 30 to close in and apprehend the occupants. - Instructions from Colonel Aucamp, 3-0, close in on that car and apprehend their occupants, over. - Message received and understood, Control. We're closing in now. - Hey, what's the matter? Cops, right behind us. Everything going as planned. Now go, get your foot down! We're going to lead them miles away. - But why, they've got nothing on us. - Do as you're told, woman. Get that accelerator flat. - [Control] Control to Car 3-0, 0-6 is in your area and will assist you, over. - They're gaining on us. - I can't help it, I can't go any faster. - You better go faster, if you know what's good for you. - No don't, please. - Thought you were so smart, didn't you, woman? (clock ticking) Watch it, girl. You nearly had us off the road back there. - We can't get away from them, we just can't! - But we're going to, little girl. You just put one little toe out of line, and you won't live long enough even to be sorry. - We're closing in fast, sir. They won't get away from us. - Yes, but I'm worried about Rene. We get any really tricky turns, she's going to roll that car. - So, you know who's in that ruddy car? Your boyfriend. - Stand by, here they come. - Cops, better slow down. Hey, you guys got trouble (grunts). (clock ticking) - Alright lady, get moving, move up! - Hey, what the heck are you doing? Right, girl, I'll get you for this. (clock ticking) (dramatic music) You crazy, you trying to kill us? (tires squealing) (tires screech) (men struggling) - Well, that's the last of it. You and the rest of Jacobi's thugs are due for a nice long rest in a prison cell. They drove right into a trap before they could get to the diamonds. That robbery didn't quite come off. - You've caught them? On the freeway? You knew about it all along? - Sure, we knew everything. You think we're fools? Your boss was lucky, though. He managed to escape. Honor among thieves. He was going to double cross you. He had a ticket on this afternoon's Alitalia flight to Rome. A single ticket. - Just, just one? He was going to run out on us? - That's right, but we'll get him. - The rat! That's why he planned the hold-up on the way to Jan Smuts. The freeway was his getaway route! - Thanks, Benjay. That's exactly the information I wanted. Now we know where it's going to take place. Sergeant, take this man in. Peters, the freeway to Jan Smuts. (clock ticking) Are you alright, Rene? He didn't hurt you? - No, he just scared the life out of me. - He's lucky. Give me the mike, Peters. Car 3-0 to Control. - Receiving you, 3-0. What's happening out there? - The car was a decoy. The holdup's taking place on the freeway to Jan Smuts Airport. - Freeway to Jan Smuts Airport. (overlapping talking) (dramatic music) (clock ticking) (torch flaring) - Helicopter One to control. In sight of holdup now. Pantechnicon on its side. - Hey, we got company. - Check who's in that (indistinct) thing. - [Thug] Hey boss, it's the cops. - Come on, you stinking steel. (dramatic music) - We've reached the freeway, Control. Should be in sight of the prey any moment now. - We have cars in your vicinity, 3-0, heading for holdup area. - Boss, we've gotta quit. That guy up there's calling the law. - Shut up! It could be nothing. This load is worth a fortune. (clock ticking) (loud clang) (gun firing) (tense music) - Take these, stow them in the car, hurry! - Hey boss, look at this! - Get the gun. (guns firing) - There they are! Take no chances, Peters, get off the road. Get behind the pillar, better cover there. (guns firing) (dramatic music) (guns firing) - Hey, bring back the car, you double-crosser! (guns firing) - Rene. (tires screeching) You got me into this, now you're going to get me out of it. - No, you might hit her. (dramatic music) Car 3-0 to Control. Jacobi has Rene Visser as a hostage in the car with him. Set up all possible roadblocks on the highway. Don't open fire. (dog barking) - Take him, Rick! (dog growling) Guard him, Rick. - Try anything, and you're dead. (tires squealing) (gun fires) - Watch out, swing away! (car explodes) (adventurous music) * Rijksvut, Rijksvut * Bring her back to life * Somewhere she's waiting just for me * She is sad and lonely * And she needs me now * Blow your sirens loudly * Take me there somehow * Rijksvut, Rijksvut * Bring her back to life * Somewhere she's waiting just for me * Na na na na na na, na na na na na * Na na na na na, na na na na
