I'm very happy for you, Rue. You're about to start a brand-new chapter. You've been clean for, like, two weeks, right? I've actually been really happy. ♪ Still don't know my name ♪ Every time I feel good, I think it'll last forever. But it doesn't. We're just reaching for something... to make it all seem meaningful. - Better tell the truth. - Well, you can't cancel for no reason. Boring is not no reason, by the way. Tyler's sick. I'm not sick. Hey. Shoes on, bub. Five more minutes. Hey, have you seen my brown heels? The one with the-- the thingies? No. Oh. All right. Let's go. Go low, go low. Yeah, right here! - Yo, go, go, go! - Got you. Cover me. Uh-huh. What happened? She didn't get rid of it. Right. That's some tough work in the post, though. Look at her. Oh my God! You're always on her side. No I'm not! I am not! I am not! I don't understand what you're saying. What do you mean, you don't understand - what I'm saying? - Because you don't say anything. It's super simple. Time travel, - or teleportation? - Hey. Please drink. - I'm fine. - Please? You think I can't tell when you're hungover? Well, no, it's just a stupid question. It's not a stupid question. You want some crackers? I'm fine. When did AJ get you home? Teleportation. Time travel. - Thank you. - What? We got one person. Seriously, who took my towel? The past is the past. That's why it's the past. I'll leave it there. So, then I'll-- I'll-- I'll just say teleportation. It's not even me. The worst is doing wall sits after a suicide. That is the worst. Oh, my God. I know tomorrow I'm not gonna be walking the same. I'm gonna be like... Bye, guys! I love you! You too. Hello. Ah! - How was practice? - Yo, she lives. - How are you not tired? - Dick. - What? Dick? Really? - Mm-hmm. Are you, uh, you good, champ? - Yeah. - Mm-hm. I'm going either way, so... I'll go by myself if I have to. - So, we're not going? - I don't know, man. Coming tonight? - Wait, who you texting? - 7-Eleven. Dylan's ready, though, you know. He's got his, uh-- He's got his pants on already. Oh, yeah. Are you gonna go? 'Cause I could take you home afterwards. - Oh, I can't. - No? - How's your day going? - Good. - Yeah, I'm really good. - Yeah? How hard is that? Just, "Bye, Dad, I love you." - That's it. That's all I need. - ...shitty waffles. They're not shitty. They're low cholesterol. - Supposed to taste like that. - Dad, I heard that. Sorry. Did you eat before you left this morning? - Yes, she did. - Mm-hmm. - When? - I was trying to hide it. Before I left. And I saw some ants on the counter too. - Oh... - It's okay. I'll spray 'em. - They will not die. - You have to kill - the colony. - Let me tell you something. We wouldn't have ants - if your mother didn't close-- - If you-- you took... - the trash out-- - If you didn't-- If you would close the damn sliding door-- She's a mess. What are you doing? She's dead. What the fuck are you doing? You can't fuck a dead... Someone take this guy to the fucking morgue. - Guys, stop. - What are you gonna do to her? She's fucking limp, man. Does it count if it's a dead body? Does sandpapering your fucking dick count? She's a mess. What are you doing? She's dead. What the fuck are you doing? You can't fuck a dead... - And the note? - Oh. I'm coming too. Who's "a few people"? I wanna hear what he has to say. He knows what happened. No. You can-- You can see what happened. I mean, before or... after... Please. - No! - Yes. - No! - I-- I liked the shorts. Pasty. Pasty-ass white shorts. Those were awful. You okay? Those are so small, and they're... Hey, you. Did you delete them? What? Oh, right. Uh, no I-- I never saved them. Why would you video that? I didn't. Who did? I don't know. But it's funny. Well, I-- I thought you'd think it was funny. Uh... You thought it was funny when we duct-taped Dylan naked to the couch, so... Just tell me what you did. What? Okay. So you... took my pants off. Wait, no, no. Okay. We-- We-- We made out. That-- That was way before you passed out. - They were off. - You did that. You-- You passed out, peeing. Look... I found you... I took a photo because it's hilarious, all right? I'm sorry. And then I-- I put some towels down. Why didn't you help me? I tried. You said you didn't wanna move, so... - I said that? - Yeah. Th-- That's why I put the towels down. When did you take me home? Well, I-- I thought you walked. You-- You were gone when I woke up, s... D-- Don't be like that, all right? Come on. Mm-mm. Honestly, it's not a big deal, okay? You're good. Oh, okay. Girl, you are the slowest. We just-- we just did defense. Hey. How you doing? Yeah, I'm-- I'm just gonna ice that. - There's no point. - You gotta see to it. What? No. You got a game coming up. Until she stops complaining. It burns you. It happened to me before too. - That doesn't work. - Do something at least, like... - Please, I'm just... - Mandy... What is that? Mandy, what is that? - What? - On your back. What is that? Shit. Right, so there's nothing from after I passed out? I got cherry. They were out of Hawaiian. - I like cherry. - I know. Cream soda's the best. Or Pepsi Fire. I don't think... he would do anything... like, really bad. I don't think any of them would do anything like that. Do you? I don't remember. I just woke up on my lawn. Outside? You woke up outside? - All right, come on! - Wake up. Come on, come on! Watch your back! You okay? Just give her space. I just think that someone could help. She doesn't want anyone else to see. I don't want help. I just wanna know what happened. Okay. You'll forget. Everyone will. Come out with us. Come on. Please. Please, Mandy. You need to come out with the girls. - I'm so tired. - You'll have fun. - It'll just be for a little bit. - Come on! She practicing by herself. Show off. - Blow it, girl. - Yeah! My lungs is gonna hurt tomorrow when we're running. Here, go. Have a good time. Honestly. Don't act like you don't need that right now. Exactly. Everybody needs this sometimes. - Just, like, inhale. - Come on. Come on. You got it. Breathe in.

Why didn't you answer your phone? 'Cause Mia had it. - Why did Mia have it? - You okay? Yeah. Is that the truth? Yes. I'm sorry, I should've... answered the phone. - Sorry. - Okay. Why do you have that? - It's okay. - We needed to know if... - why do you have that? - ...you were getting my texts. - Why do you have that? It's a-- It's a... Okay. When did this happen? Three days ago. - Three? - Mm-mm. No, no. No, no, no. I checked on you. No. You went to bed on Sunday. I checked on her. That's not... It's okay. What did you do after it happened? Did you go see the nurse? Did you, uh... Did you go to the pharmacy? - Did you take something? - Oh my God. No, it's okay. It's all gonna be okay. What's gonna be okay? No. Don't tell anyone. - Honey. - I think you should go upstairs to bed, all right? - Get a good night's sleep. - No. - Your mom and I need to talk about what to do, okay? - No. - You can talk about rape-- - Don't-- - You'll have a clear mind early in the morning-- - Don't do anything... - Man-- - ...dealing with this. - It's not a big thing. - Don't do anything. - We have to do something. - Why? I'm not telling anyone. You don't have to go through this alone. There are people out there to help us figure out - what happened. - I'm not telling anyone. I'm not making you tell anyone. It's gonna be worse if-- Worse than not knowing what happened? Worse than letting them think it's okay - to treat someone like this? - Maybe. Or do this to another girl? Do you think that's what I want? No. But I think you want choices, and I want you to have them. And I think I know the longer you wait to tell someone, the fewer you have. She's a mess. What are you doing? ...dead. What the fuck are you doing? I'm not sure. You wanna try? I don't wanna say anything if I'm not sure. Okay. You're doing great, all right? You can't fuck a dead... Someone take this guy to the fucking morgue. - Guys, stop. - Okay. She's fucking-- I know there are a lot of kids there that you didn't know, but you think you can try? We just want to talk to them to figure out what happened, okay? Um... AJ... Brennan. Okay. ...fucking limp, man. Does it count if it's a dead body? Does sandpapering your-- - Okay. - ...your fucking dick count Yeah, we've all tried that one. Close call, but... Amanda. Oh, we can go. No. I wanna hear what he has to say. I just wanna go. You know, I-- I don't understand why you'd be suspended from the team for drinking. This isn't about that. It's... It's much bigger than that. It's not about your teammates, honey. It is not the same. We'll just go in, and we will talk to the school... - Dad? - Because it's-- - it's not fair... - Yeah. Be right there. ...that you be punished for coming forward. Okay? - So, we'll just go in-- - It's not gonna be better if I'm treated different from everyone else. Dad? AJ, Logan, Michael D, Jayden, and Mason. - They're all suspended? - Vanguards. You're still allowed to come, right? You just can't play? You're still coming to the game, right? Yeah. Of course. Wouldn't miss it. - Me too. - Yeah. Good. Of course you are, bud. And since we can't play, we might as well... ...just eat Dominos... - Mm-hmm. Whoa, whoa. - ...on the bench. What about Papa Johns? Why? When you can have Dominos? Who is that? Me. I thought you blocked them. I did. They just-- They just come from new numbers. Just tell them to fuck off. Just get more. Little Caesar's is also an option. Come on, Jenna, don't walk through like that! Come on! I think you might really like it. It works for a lot of people. They use it as a therapy specifically for people who can't remember. How long will it take? Uh, it's about an hour session. No. The case. Oh, um... Um... I don't really think anyone can know that. A long time. Do you have an image from that night? No. - Why not? - Because I don't remember. Do you want to stop? We could just... do talk therapy if EMDR is hard. Okay. Can you see it? Again? No. I slept. Oh. Okay. Ooh, everybody's up. - Morning. - Hey. Want eggs? Waffles? No, I'm okay. Real breakfast is good, practice or not. Waffles, thank you. Waffles. Okay. Want to get your brother? A boy was arrested today in what appears to be a crime exposed by a video of a female Gardner High student in a vulnerable state of intoxication. The minor in question was charged with video-- I don't know how they got it, but they'll keep everyone anonymous. Is he there right now? No. Where-- Where is he? He's with his family. With a charge like video voyeurism, - we can't really keep him-- - Video voyeurism? What does-- You're not charging him with assault? We're still investigating. We can request an order of protection, though. - Keep them separated at school. - Wait, wait, wait. What-- He's still at school? - Yes. - Why is-- Why-- Why is he the only one charged? He's the only one who's admitted to us that he took any, um, graphic photos of her. So... Mm-hmm. But look, once the other phones come back, we'll know the full story, - we'll know who did what... - I thought if there was any information we'd know before... - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - ...before anything happened. Mm-hmm. I know. Hello? - Yeah. - Yeah. No, did-- did AJ say anything else about what happened? Well, no. Just the things you told us he'd said. It's a start. I'm sure this will stir up some more stories, and you'll be the first to know. Okay. - Okay? - Okay, thank you. - Thank you. - Have a good day. - Thank you. Mandy? Go ahead. "Generally ill looking and not well made, their legs small generally. They grease and black themselves when they dress, make use of--" Um, "...hawk feathers about their heads--" Mandy. No, no, no! Oh my God. So... after the game, uh, it'll be me or your mom, if it's late, okay? Okay. Okay. Come here. Give me a hug. - You all right? - Mm-hmm. It's all right. She can't make you leave. All right? It's okay. Do you think she was wrong? Who? Principal Marsh. That... it would be better for the school if I wasn't here? - She said better for you. - No. No, she said that I was a distraction. Well, then, no. Of course not. I mean... If you wanna be here, you know, like, if it's not too hard for you and stuff, it's-- it's worth it to us. And of course you should stay. Of course. Are you sure you don't wanna come to Chili's tonight? Yeah. Yeah. We'll miss you. Hey! This door open? Hello? Hello? Liar. Hey, stop it! Hey! Stop! - Hey. - What? What do you want? Nothing. Look, I didn't say anything about you. No. No, no, no. That's not what I-- - I mean, I wasn't asking. - I didn't. Look, do you want a ride home? Mandy? I, uh, want to pick you up a little early tomorrow, okay? Another one? I know talking to the police is hard, honey, but I was on the phone with the DA again today, - and she said that-- - I'm not going. I know it's hard to do so many, - but it's-- - No, I'm fine. I just have nothing new to say. Well... I think it may be about the new video evidence as well. Are you screenshotting those? Does it still matter? Yeah. If it's still violent, it still matters. Hey. - Hi. - You okay? Yeah. Good. Let's get outta here. Oh, my God. What are you doing? What the are you doing? You can't a dead body. Someone take this guy to the morgue. - Guys, stop. - What are you gonna do to her? She's limp, man. Does it count if it's a dead body? In addition to the minor who has already been charged for the production of images, police are investigating the circumstances around them, as seen in this exclusive video clip. Make sure they bring those back or send them, and that's okay. And someone has to turn in your hard copy work. Okay? Do you blame me? Blame you? Honey, I could never blame you. And Dad? Not him, either. You have to remember it's different for him. He thinks this is not normal. I knew things like this happen. I know things like this happen to someone every minute of every day. And I know they happen here. But he didn't know that, because he didn't have to. So I knew exactly what to do, and I-- I knew I could do that for you. You know, and things are different. You were lucky in all the ways you were unlucky, 'cause there is proof, and people could see it. People are typing it up for you to read. So I knew exactly what to do. But, um... I'm not so sure. I'm not sure if... this is right. I'm not sure... if what we're in is... if it's better at all, I don't... It will be. I hope so. Thank you for choosing Horizon High School as your education partner.

Can you talk for a minute? No. I mean... Now's not the time, I got... Okay. Uh, hi. - Hi. - Okay. Look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. Okay? We're really sorry about this whole business, man. - Okay, cool. - It-It-It's a shame. It's-It's terrible, it's... It's really shameful, you know? And AJ knows it too, and he's getting it worse at home - than they're giving it to him, believe me-- - Okay, okay. That's enough, man. - That's enough. - We-We didn't raise him to act like that. Like what? - Dad. - But he's a good kid, you know? - Really? - I mean, he's still just a kid. - Yeah, really. - Dad, let's go. Yeah, really, but, I mean, look, I don't like him drinking or screwing around... - I want you to get in the car. - ...any more than you like your kid doing it, and I want... - Hey, go to the car. - TONY:... to take responsibility. Okay, look, I-I just wanted to say that I'm sorry, and that he didn't mean it. All right? I know my son. He didn't do anything at that party - that any other kids didn't do. - I want you to go to the car. - All right, and, by the way... - Go to the car. ...we both know that those charges are bullshit and they're gonna get dropped. - What did you say? - I mean, it's not criminal stuff. - No, let's go. - Look, you may not like it, - and I may not like it-- - Bullshit? - Yeah, whatever-- - MANDY: Dad, let's go-- - Those charges aren't bullshit! What's going on? Nothing. I know, it's another afternoon off, but it's just that I have a family emergency that I don't-- What? Where did you hear that? - I'm finished. - No, not yet. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Your parents know you're here? Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. What's he doing here? Dylan, what are you doing here? I-- I was just checking to see how she was doing. - I can go. - No, don't. Man'... It's okay. It's so much quieter by you. - It's kinda creepy. - I like it. Just, you've always lived here. If you could go anywhere in the world right now, where would you be? - I know, it's stupid. - No. Um... I've never been to California. Me neither. I've never even seen a desert. Do you wanna come back? Okay, okay... - Whoo! - Which one? Are you videotaping me? We're in a movie. - How many kids? - I told you. Can I go to Jenna's tonight? She wants to see you? Yeah. Oh, what's happening tonight? Do I need a reason to see my friends? Does she wanna come over here? - I wanna go there. - It's not a good idea right now. - Why not? - Because... it's not a good time. - Why? - Beca-- Hey, come on, do I have to explain it to you? You know, with the case, - and a school night-- - Do I have school nights anymore? - It's just not appropriate. - Mandy. - Why not? - Because I said no! How many times I gotta explain it to you? Don't you think you've been out enough? Jesus. - You want something to drink? - Yeah. Are you happy you're here? Yeah. - How are you? - I'm good. - You got a drink? - Yeah. You're crazy! Sorry I haven't been texting... Just know that I've missed you. Do you wanna play? I'm good. It's a long walk. Not really. You sure? I shouldn't have come. Don't say that. Oh, I mean... did you have a bad time? No. See, it... It was nice. Okay. No, wait. It was nice. It felt normal. - I took you home. - What? I did pass out, but when I woke up, you were there. And... you wanted to go home, so I took you. But I thought you were okay. I saw you walk... I saw you walking to your house. You were talking, I-- I thought you were fine. I never would've left you like that... Outside. Alone. I just so wanted to tell you, - but-- - So, why didn't you? - I'm sorry. - What else? - Do you know what happened? - No. - Do you know what they did? - No. Just look at me. Look at me. I don't-- I don't-- I don't remember anything, and I don't think I ever will. I can't see anything. What if you don't? You may never remember. Does that mean we can't help you? Kerri! He knew before us. - He-- Tony! He said... - Who knew? - What? - ...when I saw him at-- Well, either he didn't take any, or he deleted them and they were overwritten, but, either way, there's, uh, no photos on his phone. Whose phone were they on? We can't find them originating on any phone. - What? - How can that be? We have them being sent and received, but it's in texts. There's nothing in photos, so... there's no way to know who took what. - Wait, how many... - Okay, they have to be... - ...phones do you have? - ...on someone's phone. They exist. If they weren't overwritten, - but even if they weren't-- - Weren't what? Well, you still have to prove that whoever it was was using their phone at the time, that it's definitely her in the photos, that she didn't do it herself... - Def-Definitely her? - That's nuts! Y-Y-- So you're just gonna drop it now? It's not us. The DA decides. Do you know any more about what happened now than when we started? Nothing definitive like that, no. How many phones do you have? We have seven phones and two tablets. - There were 40 to 50 kids at that party. - And there's a video. There are 2000 students at that school. Someone knows what went on, sir! - Do you want me to get 2000 warrants-- - Yes, I do, yes, I do. - So-- So, there's a video of him. He admitted... - As of now, ...that they were intimate. He-- I spoke to a lawyer this morning. She said they work with other girls... other girls like you. She said she's looked over the case herself. And she thinks there is more. There are more answers, there are more charges, even assault for AJ, maybe. If we can get a special prosecutor - assigned to the case-- - How would that happen? She thinks the best thing for you to do right now is to do a press conference. Um, you know, if they-- if they see your face-- How can I stay here after something like that? Uh, well, I was thinking that... yeah, maybe-- maybe we leave for a little bit, while-- Where would we go? We don't have to decide that right now. Well, telling your story will definitely help - the investigation keep going. - Right. Mm-hmm. Press conferences, interviews, especially on camera. And we can help with that. - Mm-hmm. - You've got options. A civil case is-- you've got a lot more control - than in a criminal case. - But it'll be more private. It's still public record, but you decide how you want justice. - Um, whether you go to trial-- - So-- So, AJ will still be punished for what he did? The photos and everything else. Uh, well, I can't promise that, but I can promise that we'll stand by you no matter what. And we will fight as hard and for as long as it takes. But it won't be as drawn out - as-- - Yeah. - ...the criminal case, right? - It-- It's hard to say. How long can it take? It can be, um, years. Several years. Appeals, more. Yeah. But, in that trial... you can get more evidence... Yeah, the-- the... - ...about what happened? - ...the other boys in the video. Hey, d'you know there's a new AAU team near your grandma's? Well, I mean, you don't have to say anything if you don't want to say anything. I was drinking a lot. Mm-hmm. Dad, I was drinking a lot because I wanted to. Yeah, and you're small, - so it's going to be difficult to metabolize that-- - I'm not small. I was drinking a lot 'cause I wanted to. Nobody made me. Nobody made me get drunk, nobody... I just like going to parties, I like hooking up with people, and I've hooked up with a lot of people. Why are you talking like that? - Because I wanted to! - Well who gives a shit? Nobody made me! - Nobody made me go! And nobody made me get-- - Jesus, so what? So what? So what? Who gives a shit what you did? Who gives a shit what you did, Mandy? Does that give them a right to do whatever they want to you? Does it? Hello? They dropped the charges against you. Oh, uh, yeah. - I'm sorry. - For what? Everything. That this is happening to you, and... I don't know, um... doing that stuff. What stuff? You know... making it a joke and... taking those photos and, you know, humiliating you. Is-- Did you... Did you do anything else? No. Are you telling the truth? Yes. There's a travel team two towns away. You could start playing whenever we got there. That'd be good, right? Yeah. And Grandma's isn't so far. Your dad could... - go back and forth, for a while. - Of course, yeah. It's beautiful there, right? You could be happy there. I could be happy here. Is this about the move? We don't have to go. If it's about the interview, you don't have to do that. We don't have to do any of those things - for the case to move forward. - Yeah, I know. It doesn't all have to be hard. It doesn't... just have to be something you survived. It would be a different life. But it could be a bigger life. You could start over. I don't wanna start over. I wanna finish now. I'm okay. Kaylee, seriously? - Come here. - No... Yeah. Do you need anything? No, I'm good. Okay. Jenna said you were leaving. Yeah. You don't wanna stay a little longer? My dad's coming. Oh. Do you wanna hang out later? No. What did you say? What were you saying? What did you say? What were you saying? What did you say? Mandy, what did you say? What did you say?
