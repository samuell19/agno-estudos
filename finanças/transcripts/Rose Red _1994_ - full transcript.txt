(ominous music) (footsteps) (gasp) (dialling) - [Phone Operator] Welcome to Dr. Marx's night line. - Hello Dr. Marx? It's Thomas Shaw. - [Phone Operator] Please wait. Thomas Shaw. File search. (heart beating) - [Phone Operator] How may I help you? - Its my dream again. - [Phone Operator] Tell me all about your dream. - [Thomas] I still do the same thing. And I want to know what it means. - [Phone Operator] Well yes, meaning. - [Thomas] I.. I want to know why I help her. - [Phone Operator] Do you get through to her? - [Thomas] Yes... yes I do. (breathing) - [Phone Operator] Why do you hurt her? - [Thomas] I enjoy it. Look its just a dream. - [Phone Operator] But you enjoy hurting her. - Exactly. Every night. - Thomas? - Nothing. Its just a dream. - [Female] Again? (sigh) - Go back to sleep. (ominous music) (glass shatters) (footsteps approaching) - I called security to see a Dr. Lewis. - Hi Evan, I booked you into monitor room 27. - Thomas Shaw - Lewis. Hi. - Hi. - Our surveillance people pulled you this disc from the pharmacy cameras. - Thanks. (heavy footsteps) - First floor - This, is what was stolen. Rose Red. - What does it do? - Cripples your immune system. - Why would anyone want that? - You see this unit here essentially is a plug. We use it to connect people to machines. Think of it... as an extension socket for the human brain. - And the Rose Red? - Normally an implant like this would cause a massive immune response. Meningitis, brain damage. - Really? - Well, the implant is a foreign body and Rose Red suppresses the response. - Right now your mind is hardwired to your body but if we plug you in, it can transmit your mind somewhere else. Right now he is flying an experimental shuttle over China. At least his mind is. - Does it hurt? - No - What's it like? - Paradise. Seconds in there seem like years to him. - [Lewis] Yeah but what does he feel? - Well, timelessness. Freedom. The power of flight. Its good. (smirks) - [Computer] Force unknown - [Lewis] System report. - [Computer] System cured. There is no cause for concern. - [Thomas] He volunteered for this. - Hmm - Its like sleep walking. But not real. - Inhabiting a machine is no less real than inhabiting a body. In many ways its more immediate, more... exhilarating. - Its that good, huh? (Computer raises alarm) - [Lewis] That's enough. Shut down. - [Computer] Remote system infected. Remote system does not respond. - Override it. - [Computer] No response from remote system. - Flush it. - [Computer] Flushing memory status. Deleted. (keyboard sounds) - Subject attempted hijack. Dr. Lewis's project. List requirements. (garbled computer audio) - [Computer] Sensory deprivation tank available. Landline connection to project not available. - Subject. Theft of experimental immune suppressant, Rose Red. Identify the suspect, please. - [Computer] Please wait. - Okay. - [Computer] Connected to public archives. Search underway.

A special regime of... - Rewind 20 seconds. - [Computer] During sea survival exercise was a victim of sexual assault by unknown assailant. (repeats sentence with reverb) (phone rings) - [Eva] Hi it's me. We need software and landline. - Eva? - [Eva] We can't access the project without a landline. - So? - [Eva] Well the hijackers must've had a landline. - So? - [Eva] The only one I could find runs from the old project buildings. Its supposed to be offline. The building's empty. Maybe we should go take a look. Any luck on the ID? - [Thomas] ID? No... no no. - [Eva] Thomas? Are you okay? - [Thomas] Okay? Yeah. No yeah, I'm fine. (helicopter blades whirring) (lighter clicks) - Do you recognise this? Just I've got a disc of you stealing it. And a man died last week. He was plugged into the project when you hijacked it. I was there I saw it. - [Claire] You don't know the first thing about it. - No. Would you tell me? Where did you get this? - [Computer] Landline and radio connection confirmed. - I wrote it myself. - [Computer] Instructions please. - And this? Does this, go in here? - Fill the tank. - You've never used it. _ I thought I could manage without it. It only takes 2 or 3 seconds to connect to the project. - So? - [Claire] Unless you're floating it doesn't work. Its useless your... senses kind of hold you back. Trapped in your own body. - So why have you never used it? - I was afraid of the water. I nearly drowned once. I get scared inside the tank. When they found out, they got rid of me. - Come with me. You're okay. I'm not going to hurt you. I won't hurt you. Okay? Okay? Have I helped you? Have I? Have I helped you? - What? - Have I? - Yes - So waken (ominous music playing) - [Computer] Shutdown sequence begin. All other protocols will be disregarded. Expected data loss 38 gigabytes.
