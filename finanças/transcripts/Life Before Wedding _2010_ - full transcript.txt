My foot! I too did it a lakh times. Learn from me, man! Anything worked out back home? Can't you get it from his face? What are you planning to do now? I'm confused what to do. What's there in it to get confused? Do you like it or not? I like. - Then, elope and marry. That'll be curtains down to everything. Situation isn't as simple as that in my home. Most of the parents aren't like our parents. If you take a decision, it means you like it, right? If you like it, you must be able to convince anyone. I mean, how would he know the decision he takes now is right or not. Stop joking, we take a decision which we feel is right at that time. Isn't it? He'll marry now thinking the decision is right, what if he feels like divorcing her after few days? Is it your mouth or stinking drain? Can't you ever say something good? What exactly you're trying to tell now? Should he marry that girl or marry the girl selected by parents? T don't know. Anyway how would he know it now? He'll know it only after a year, right? If you don't have an answer, shut your mouth, don't talk nonsense. Not only his life but that girl's life also depends on the decision he takes. So, think and take the right decision. Did you get it? Think well and decide. The problem is mine, why are you both fighting it out? It's parents who complicate every love story. When he's incapable deciding, how can you blame his parents? You mean?- I mean we ourselves are complicating our lives. Why should we blame parents? Why would we ourselves complicate our lives? Why not think over it? Our lives depend on the decisions we take who influenced it is secondary. Recause it affects our lives why would we ourselves complicate our lives? Okay guys, I'll tell a story about my friends which happened 4 years ago. He says he'll narrate a story? You know if he starts, he'll not stop. You shut up. In Dallas, I've a close friend rajesh... I know a friend in hyderabad... Are you also joining him? He has already started it, right? Let him finish it, you'll get your chance. It'll not be interesting if I tell after he finishes, I'll tell now. Hear... There are two friends Jay and rishi in hyderabad... Stop that nonsense and call ram to find where he is. You'll never change, from boys we're young men, but I've failed to make you talk yet. Please say something, give some reaction. Bloody, react at least little. What's that look? Say something man! React hittle I eave her hanadl Calm down! You know them, right? We three are friends from kindergarten. Till college. But they're doing engineering in vardhamans and I'm doing at geethams. Jay is eamcet ranker, rishi paid donation for seat. What would you like to have? You shruthi? You'll talk now! Rishi is little hyper amongst us three. For her activeness, rishi is the right person. Are you talking about me? Is it right to over do on the first day? Will you scare them on the first day? So, what do you do? Don't over act so much, she's unlike me, very straight forward. She talks to the point, rarely comes out, never attends parties, she'll not speak to people che doesn't know much. All are our friends. Are you interviewing her? To make her comfortable, 1 need to know her likes and dislikes, right? Whether she likes movies, bowling, snooker... No problem, we'll teach her. I wake up there only, right? But I need to attend college, right? I think order is ready, I'll check. Do we've the luck to hearing your voice today. Jay? What did you say, shruthi? 3why? This song is good, right? It's good, but Jay can't sleep without listening it at least 15 times everyday. We'll get bored if he listens to it so many times. Don't misjudge him as great romantic since he hears this song. He 1sn't. No thums up, so Pepsi. Boy, here's your coffee, enough of singing lullaby to the child. Drink. Rut she let's try once. If you don't like it... Let's try once again. Come on tell her. Agree. Agree! I don't know why I'm happy and laughing loud today... I don't know why I'm feeling strange today... There's no stopping for the mischief today... You're following me like my shadow... I'm confused and thinking... Within myself... 1 saw many a truth... In you... in your eyes... in your words... In these differences... Are you playing with me? I told myself not to see the reality... You told me. 1 heard you tell me to open up... One leg says to join you and another says no... Right? You want me to fix the program or not? Dlease do it. If you fix it quickly, let's celebrate. What's the special? How mean you are? You're fixing the program, and asking what the special? Where are we celebrating? Cool river? Shall we go to kismet? Not there. - Why? If we celebrate with a party for everything, parties have no value. If you get bored in the club would others stop celebrating? I can't argue with you. Never argue with me. Okay, I'll get ready, you finish it. Will you come in this dress? Isn't it good? - Horrible! Bloody! No sense of fashion. Bloody low class mentality. Come. Your hairstyle isn't good. You said let's try today. - Now? Let's try next time. How long will you keep on postponing it? Do you mean it? If we both drink, who will drive to home? Let's do one thing, you try today. I'll try it next time. Okay. Re carefull Okay... okay... Okay... okay... go to sleep! What's it buddy? My boss is just a fly to me. Nothing, tonight I've arranged a party, come with all your friends. There are drinks and food too. Why would I invite you without it? I didn't mean girls, I meant drinks. You mistook! Come, cut the line now. Are you here for coffee? No, we're playing marbles. There are few problems in documentation. Few problems? Rajesh wrote your entire program. He designed it. To write document on the written program, you lazy bum! Do you want help? Who the hell hired you anyway? Come with me, let me talk to the hr. Chill? Why chill? Will you pay your salary to rajesh? Tell me. Look you srinivasulu from anakapalli, you're doing too much. If I see you around rajesh next time, I'll call hr, get going. Why are you encouraging him? I'm just helping him, that's all. He doesn't know anything, he got the job by faking the interview. He has no interest to learn at least now. Such people live happily with help from people like you. It's sin to help him. Leave it I say! You take everything in life very easy. You don't have any tension in life. How long have you been here? About half an hour. Dad was at home. Where is rishi? Went to the next shop. Shall I order something for you? No. I'm asking you seriously, will you tell me the truth? Does he smoke? I'm asking you that. So, he smokes, right? Did you also hide the truth from me? Do you also smoke? Then? Can't you at least tell me that? Aren't you both good friends? Why does he have the habit which you don't? I went to the next shop before you came, that's all. I got little late. Why didn't you tell me you smoke? Did you have breakfast today morning? Did you tell me that? Why didn't you tell me till now that you smoke? Do I smell? I'm using mint.. T smoke sometimes. You hid the truth from me. Now that you know it, right? Hereafter I'll tell you and then smoke. From now onwarads. Do I need to know anything more about you? Nothing. - Think and tell me. How can you tell without even thinking for a moment? There is one thing! What's 11? Nothing short in this. Didn't get any sense this year too! I've to detain you this year again. Sir, one last time. One last time? For shortage of attendance I detained you in second year, yet you didn't reform. Asking for one last time again, I told you to come with your father last year for lack of attendance, you didn't come with him, you said he's a vip and very busy man, and had him talk over phone, what's there for me to lose? This is your life. When you and your parents are not bothered, why should I? If you come with your father and give proper reason for lack of attendance, I'll let you take the exams. Get me a drink! What happened? - What else? Come with father, the same story. What's your attendance? What are you doing without attending classes? You're coming to college everyday with me, right? Who will attend classes? It's bore! Don't listen to the lectures, at least attend to get attendance. What do you do bunking classes? That's not the problem now, tell me what should I do? What can you do? Tell uncle and let him talk to principal. Are you mad? If my dad comes to know about this matter, he'll know I'm still in second year and not in third year. Forget about talking to the principal, he'll throw me out of the home. I asked you help not advice. Do you want to continue in second year again? Please listen to me, let bygones be bygones. I'll talk to your father. Don't make it a bigger issue. He'll scold you, that's allt I've already got enough stick from him, you don't add to my woes. I'll do whatever it is myself, take 2 break. What happened? Then... then... What had happened was... Wait, I'm coming! Hey dumbo! Nobody's beating you. It's useless to give him surprizes too! Come with me. Sit on the bed. Sit! Close your eyes. Closel What happened to you? Why are you like this? Okay. Radhika, may get late, you go to sleep, let's talk tomorrow, no, I'll not sleep now, lot of foodq, your friend may be hungry. What happened to you? How do you know I'm here? T boarded it. Rut no clearance for take off I got worried about missing my connecting flight in Atlanta. Don t worry... That was the last flight yesterday. Apart from that, weather is not good, so all flights are cancelled tomorrow, he should've been thrown in a ship, he'd be dead, never reaching here. I was getting calls on phone. You should've also died along with it. T had to take 2A bus. Will he ever shut his mouth? Why are your clothes torn? Why were you so dirty? He would've picked up rouble with someone. 1 got down from bus at downtown. A black mani he should've stabbed you. Got good riddance! It's 3 aml your story is excellent! But I've work tomorrow, you carry on. I'll listen tomorrow definitely. Bloody crook! Did that idiot had to come at the right time? How much hard work I did today? Where 107? Where else? To 23a movie. I'll not come. I've work. Do you ve work? What's the work which I don't know? Don't you do so many things which you don't tell me? Are you angry on me? So I've to pacify you also along with an... What happened with anu? What else? Cigarette... - Why? Didn't quit smoking yet? I'll quit, please don't push me. Anu is waiting in theatre, be there in two minutes, cut it. Why should I join you both to watch the film? Is it? Then give me your car. No way, I know how you drive and where you will go with it. My parents still scold me for the last accident. So, shut your mouth and come with me. You'll not have problems if anu comes with me on my bike, but anu refuses to ride on my bike. If seems her relatives may see and inform her dad. As if hers is royal family and city is full of their relatives. You're becoming a dictionary off late. After the movie, let's go to hanger's spot. Hangers spot? I'll not come. Give your car then. I told you I'll quit. Look at the moon, how beautiful it is! Hands off me. You said moon is beautiful, right? So what? Rishi, take your hands off me. Just once! What should I give? Not once or twice. Hands off me. I'm asking you romantically and you're so serious. Romantic? Nothing you do is romantic. What a bloody life! She's not my girl friend, she's like my grandmother. No kiss or no romance. 1but she wants movies, outings, ice crams. Without doing anything with her, without telling anyone that she's my girl friend, why? I'm losing rs.1000 every day. Drop me to my bike. Why are you so serious? What happened? Nothing, please drop me. My exams start from 18, I'll not come out for 2 month. It's dark, I'll drop you at home. No need. No, I'm coming, you go an... What happened? - Nothing. Drop me at ramesh's room. My fate! Why are you sitting here? Let's drop him on the way. Then, ask him to sit in the backside. Can't you sit in the backseat? If I sit in the back, when you get down, I've to come to the front seat. Now that I'm here Ana the door is also open, if you sit in the back, we'll save a lot of time, I don't mind if rajesh wants to be my driver today. I'll sit in the back. Decide and tell me now. I'l wait here. You sit in the back, it's useless to fight this idiot. I beg you, please sit. Without any hesitation... Didn't I offer you dinner within an hour, right? You ate like a bandicoot, why didn't you ask me then? You realised it very late. How long will he stay here? What are you searching? What do you want? Can't you ask me? I'll get it for you. You drive which one shall I play? What do you want now? My phone... Where did you keep it? In my pocket, and this seat belt... Wait, I'll take it out, you watch the road. No need, I'll take it myself. Remove your hand. Okay, as you wish. I'll pick you up at 6 pm, be ready. This is my first day... Today is my birthday party, have you forgotten it? I'm not yet out of the shock. The braying donkey spoilt the grazing donkey. No, one braying donkey joined another braying donkey. I've to carry two people now. Who told you to swear? Is it good to use bad words for your personality? Don't do it, I don't want. No need. I caid I don't want. Don't do anything, please. 1 told you I'm sorry. Don't get so irritated. Promise me not to pick up fight with everyone you meet. Am I picking fight with every fool I see on road? Last night fight with that guy, vesterday morning had fight with varun, and with seenu in office a day before that is it enough? You want to list out further. How can you ask me to quit so easily? You mean will you stop fighting slowly? I don't care all that, you said anything. Anything means this? There's a lot to ask me. Okay, I know you can't live without fights. At least reduce a fight every week. Is it necessary to get up now? I need to got bathroom, don't you want me to go? (0. Everybody knows it. Tell me something new. I would've told him by now, you walked in at the right time. I don't know when will I get euch a situation. Moreover got a bad name for getting him beaten up on his birthday. Leave it, I'll do it myself, leave me alone. I've great experience in matters like this. Come to the pool at 1 pm, let's sketch a plan. Why at pool? It'll keep us cool. Stop those foolish poses and tell me what's the plan? You asked me so respectfiully... Fake goons are hired to make girls fall. Not to flatter boys. Don't you've any original idea other than copying from films? You don't need to do anything, leave me alone. I'll manage myself. Really? Do you want me to tell him? Let his wounds heal, I'll tell him. What are you doing? Nothing much, preparing for exams. What are you doing? I'm fighting it out with c language fight, nothing wrong in it. Can you help me? Tell me the basics. I'm anu"s mother. Greetings. Greetings, please come in. Anu, Jay is here. Please sit down, what would you like to have? I'll call anu, please be seated. Does your mother know me? She knows where 1s shruthi? If tiger isn't at home, it's party time for shruthi. I'm not that smart, today I'm a bit lucky. Then, Jay and me are one team and you both are one team. Let's play a game. Challenge? Let's play! Not just like that, losers must cook lunch. Cook? - T can't cook. Nothing to worry, they're just boasting, they too aren't much of cooks. Anyway I'm there! When I play, nobody else wins. How long? Aster! What's this? Look at the shape! What's this? Just shut your mouth and eat. Losers must cook properly. No way. Who will get me water? By the way I never asked your father's name. He's a public works contractor. Yes aunty, people call him like that only. We do meet him regularly in functions. Your father doesn't know us. He's very serious, right? Yes aunty. Serious than our tiger? Don't you know what to say and what ought not to say? Look, if lack of attendance, you put it yourself, it's all in your hands. Are you reading news on TV? Read it properly. How I read doesn't matter, action must be good, come with me. Coins... give me coins. Why sir? I'm rilshi's father here. The student who is lacking attendance and you wanted me to call... That rishi? I didn't ask you to call me. 1 wanted you to meet me personally. I'm a busy businessman. I don't have time to meet you personally. I'm at Delhi airport. But your son's attendance is dismal. If he falls short, you make it up. It's all in your hands, right? Allow him to write exam this time. Ramesh, one cigarette. I'll meet you personally after my euro trip. Can you please hold on the line? I've another important call. Please come quickly, I'm getting late for my flight. Where did he go away? What's your name? Loudly! Which year? Loudly please! Write third year exam next year, you wanted to catch a flight, right? I eave now. Mother promise sir, I'll never be seen with again. Let's discuss after your Europe tour. What shall I do with you? I et"s do hike this. Come with your father, if you don't come with him, ho heed to attend college next year too. You don't need to come to college at all. Where are you? I'm studying, I've an exam tomorrow. Come to hangout spot. Hang out spot? I told you I'll not come out till I finish my exams. Why will you not come? Come right now. T want a kiss. Don't talk mad, cut the line. I'll not cut the line, you come here. Why are you speaking differently? Are you drunk? Why would i1... yes, I'm drunk, my wish! I will drink, you come to hangout spot. How dare you cut my phone call! How arrogant: I'm coming! Did she complain to you? It has become habit to her to complain to you. I'll not answer you, go to hell, I'll not pick your call. How do I look? Ain't it beautiful? Would he say yes? If you ask me... That's why I'm not asking you. How about in next life? Let me see. Waiting list is too long! Where 1s he? I think he's working in his bedroom. What happened to rishi? What happened? He's not answering my phone calls. Ti don't know if he wrote the exams or not. I don't have the courage to face uncle to go to his home. Did he have any fight with you? He called me two weeks back fully drunk. Did he call getting drunk? He'll never get sense. Ti don't like rishi's behaviour. He's in problems, I'll talk to him. Please give me one chance. Come to hangout spot at 5 pm, Are you wearing a sari? Tell me when did you wear 2 Earl last time?- That is I'm here to talk something serious. I'm here to talk something serious and you're cracking jokes. You spoilt my mood. I've decided to tell you. I'll tell and leave. What did you say now? Didn't you hear me? I heard it, that's why I'm asking you again. Not that. Why did you feel like that? You mean... didn't you ever have such feelings for me? I never saw you like that. You're the most important person to me in this world. But... I don't know where to hide my head? Not like that, how could you think like that? How? How am I to think? If I ignorantly made you feel like that, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. Leave me alone for sometime please. Why are you getting so serious? I'm a fighter cock, right? Let's talk about college later, I'm telling you for the last time, anu is very good girl, don't lose her unnecessarily. Let bygones be bygones, I'll talk to anu, I'm sure she'll heed my words. In a way I'm also responsible for this situation. Let's talk to uncle later this evening. Actually I should've told uncle everything by now. What's this? I'm telling you, right? Watch, everything will be normal from tomorrow. I'm telling you. Anu is coming, wipe your tears. How did you write your exams, rishi? I'll answer you that. Rishi, you tell me, how did you write the exams? T wrote 1t well. Lie! Lying to me again. I can explain it to you. - No. I don't need anyone's explanation. What will you explain? Will you explain why he's still in 2nd year though he should be in 4th year? I don't have the Patience to listen to your lies. Did you lie to me? I was happy before meeting you. Don't try to meet me again. Anu has reason to feel hurt, because rishi lied to her from the beginning. But why is Jay feeling so much? Because Jay and anu's friendship developed on mutual trust, and rishi and Jay are friends since childhood, I'll tell you.. - Wait. Wait. _ Is rajesh mad? Why is he worried if his close friend proposes to him? Should close friend fall in love with him? Rajesh has his own reasons. I'll tell you. Do you know all this? That radhika likes you? You too know it. I didn't mean that. Don't make wry comments. I never got such an idea. You both stay in a home, are seen always together, 1f not radhika the point is not that, I never thought I'll love someone. I always thought my parents will select a bride and I'll marry her. It's not love if you plan and do it. What do you want me to do now? She'll get more upset on seeing me. You talk to her. T can't talk now. I'll not take much time. Tell me. Not here, let's sit inside and talk. Okay. Tell me. I didn't mean to hurt you, I didn't tell not to hurt you. I didn't mean to cheat you. Actually I wanted to tell... Don't talk about that. Whether you've time for it or not... If you think I cheated you. I'm not angry on you Jay. Whether it is do re mu... Or pa so. These are the rhythms... Though thousands of songs, these are the words how many clouds it may be? No cloud can stop the sunray... Whatever this world may be... This friendship will never change... What would happen to the falling rain drop... What would happen to this tale? Whatever it is, laugh out today only... One must hke each other. I 1ke this word. What would happen as this story proceeds? Who would become whose partner as this story changes gear? If you say or deny... Or say whatever you may... Won't the change of time come? The legs stopped... It stopped and then moved on... This day... What's wrong with gita? Is it danger to life? Have you gone mad? Why are you beating me? Getting late to office. No office today? Please listen to me once. Please listen to me once. Please listen to me once. I didn't take bath today. I'll take bath after you pour something on me. Do whatever you want to. Boss is eating us. The software we're working, 2 new version has been launched. He wants us to attend training classes. How many days training? How can I leave radhika in this condition? That's why I'm telling you to go. If you go to Phoenix for two weeks... Idea is good... Not just good, it's great. Get ready, let's go. You've a surprize! Where 107? I'll not come. Can't you understand if I tell? In a burst of anger... I said sorry, right? Then I don't want your sorry. Even if shore says no... The waves will not stop... If someone says no... Why do you stop moving? Dreams will not come if eyes ask... Whatever it is you've to be with yourself... In this dying day... Won't this darkness break into a dawn of light next morning? Though your silence says no to loneliness. You won't keep quiet saying it's my wish... If hurt is tears, it'll melt away... If there's no separation, there's no love Will I say no to happiness? If 1 say I don't want, leave me, sorrow will not leave me, right? Separation is a way to know love... Love will not come for me, right? I don't feel like going home. How long can you escape from reality? Someday you've to face it. You haven't done anything wrong. I told you already, had you proposed to me instead of him, you wouldn't wasted so much time. Where are you guys? Been trying for 3 days. How 1s radhika now? 1 may have to stay for another week. I'll call you later. Those days won't come back like today... Can we know the days of future? What would happen at any moment, is it written anywhere? Whatever the dream may be, it'e 3 dream after all. If what you expect happens... Can we stop what might happen in future? If you're with yourself, the wish is yours... Ups and downs in a relationship depends on you only... There's something magic in these new paths... Love is victory... It's all brightness ahead... Whatever it is you're yourself, right? Will the rivers stagnate in ohne place without flowing? Nothing will stop at one place, it'll move and keep changing... If eyes say ho, can dreams vanish? Look at these photos. - Photos? Who are they, mom? They look strange. Stop joking, tell me if you like anyone amongst them. Why? To work in our home? Stop joking, for marriage. Marriage? For elder sister? Sister's marriage is fixed, if you like anyone, we'll fix your marriage too. I don't want to marry now, I must study further, I must do masters then, then find a job, and then go to America... It may happen, but tell me seriously if you like anyone from them. Are you serious about it? - Yes. If you really like anyone, we'll fix your marriage. Come in. What's cooking aunty? Mashed mango pulse and sambhar. Then, I'll have lunch here. Why is the home so silent today, aunty? I think both the she-devils are not in home. She's in that position since morning. There are photos on the coffee table, tell me if you like anyone. For shruthi? We got it for shruthi only. But if we find a good proposal, we'll fix anu's marriage too. Don't know which cloud will turn into rain drops when... Don't know which rain will turn into floods in which place... Don't know where friendship will begin... Don't know when this friendship will turn into love... Wave may raise high like sea... It'll hit the shore and stop... Though walked together... Will it stop even if you wish to stop... When lightning strike to brighten skies... Is it possible to stop it? Whatever the feelings one's heart may develop... Can it is possible to show it even if one wishes to. Please ask. Hubby, we are searching proposals for our daughters, right? Let's fix shruthi"s marriage first and fix anu's marriage later. Why? If we fix two marriages at a time, after living together with two daughters for 20 years, if both of them leave home at 3 time. I too would become... Okay, as you wish. Without the knowledge of the other... Want more moments of watching secretly... When the moment of truth stands before you... Do you want see evidences? What happened to you? You hike her. Shall ti tell her? Don't know how she'll react. No use standing here, take risk. 1 forgot. Whether you know it or not... Whether it 1s silence. Can words say what it ought to... Are the dreams that melt away in eyes? Can they ever come true... Ram and me are fans of pavan kalyan since our childhood. Do you ve college now? Igotajobis us. I'm going away next week. 1 cant anymore. My legs are paining. I cant walk anymore. Ti can't. Let's take some rest and proceed. What? Really? Forget it. Do you think I can't carry you? What are you preparing for dinner? Wait, I'll help you. I'll help you, give me. Give me, I said I'll help you. You've worked hard already. Time to leave. It'il be good. I'll order another one. Little messy. Last night friends were here. Got closer in a moment... Got separated in a moment... My life is just a moment... This moment of life 1s eternal... Any Indians? Indians? Ask if there are Americans. It's desis everywhere in Dallas. Is it? I was afraid you would settle down there with some white girl. When breath turned into memories to awaken the heart we merged into one soul and forgot this world... My girl friend's wonderful fragrance took over me and my soul... I knew this is love when I felt the happiness which I never experienced... Tell me dear. Nothing, I'm busy with work. Hubby! I want to know your opinion about Jay. Why? I mean Jay is very good boy... So what? He's working with IBM. He was the lone candidate selected from his entire batch. So what? You know very well about his family. Wealthy too! You know his father too. What are you trying to say? Jay likes anu very much. Likewise anu to likes Jay very much. Anu and Jay will make a great couple. Look, you know how short temper his father is. Everybody knows what was his reaction on Jay's brother. Okay, since you say anu too likes him, ask Jay to talk to his father, and then we'll decide. Meeting at 10 tomorrow... Are you busy? Another 4 months of Patience, life is settled Why are you so dull? Really? Why are you so dull then? If I had choice ti wouldn't have come here. You know everything, yet why do you... When will you talk to him? With whom? - With your father! Do I've to talk to him immediately? You mean? You know the situation in my home, right? I can't talk to him till my sister is married. But I didn't expect my father would agree so easily. I think it's better to talk to your father before my dad changes his mind. How 7 after what my brother did, my father hates such things. I thought I could talk to him if my sister is married. When will your sister marry? How would it know? My parents are searching proposals for her. If we wait till then I'll take care of everything. Don't forget, sunil is giving party today evening I'll pick you up at 5.30 pm. I've lot of work in office. I'll greet him later. What happened to him? Thank god, you got ready on time. No please, I'll take varun's car. Why varun's car? I've a car, right? You're going to sunil's birthday party, right? Yes, you too are coming there, right? No, gita is giving a party for fixing her marriage. I told you, right? When did you tell me? Didn't I tell you? Gita's marriage is fixed and she's giving a dinner. We're going there. I'll take varun's car. She didn't tell me. By the way, who is gita? Gita! Don't you know gita? Contractor in my team. You never introduced her to me. Didn't I? I'll do 1it tomorrow. Rut. Please come in. How long? One week or one month? Mother... It's Mel I'm fine but... Won't you arrange my marriage? Marriage... marriage mother! Okay... search... Send me photos. Isn't she good? I ook at her blo... Look at this girl. Average but financial analyst with aig. She'll take care of all your investments. Not that much, not even average. Stop... stop... Let me see the photo. Will you see the photos? What happened? Did Jay talk to his father? Not yet. He said he'll talk to him after his sister's marriage. When will that happen? They're searching for proposals. Nothing yet fixed. It'll be fixed. Already he took 6 months time. How much more time does he need? Think over it, assume his sister's marriage is over, does he have the courage to stand up to his father and ask? He didn't agree that's why his brother married secretly. Why would he agree for this marriage? Our daughter is more important to us. I agreed because our daughter likes him. Am I cheap because I agreed first? Why do you think like that? I thought like that, so 6 months sped away. If he likes let him marry or else give up. Okay, forget all that. Sambasiva rao will come with his family to the marriage, they want to see our anu. Ono hubby... I can't wait till in the anticipation of something happening. I must make efforts from my side. If anything happens meanwhile, it's well and good. Got time for me at last? It's unnecessary whatever that happens here, always worried about yourself and your work. It's been over 6 months since I asked you to talk to your dad. You didn't even talk to them once. I've told you many times, how many more times do I've to tell you? First my sister's marriage! When will it happen? My father will fix my marriage elsewhere. Then you can wait all your life for your sister's marriage. You don't the situation in my house. You're talking too much! Now I got it, you're scared of talking to your dad. Your brother was hundred times better than you. He wasn't a coward like you. He dared to elope and marry. It seems some vow or somebody is sick or dead or something in the bride's family. They want early marriage, so fixed it 3 weeks away. Marriage? In 3 weeks? Who is the girl anyway? The same girl we had decided. What happened? What happened? - That thing... What do you want? I want you to call me like that. I'm calling you, right? All my lifel yes, I don't want this marriage. I've committed a blunder. I didn't realise you then. Though you loved me so much. Don't talk mad, rajesh. Start the car. I'm really going mad. I cantsileep, I'm unable to eat anything. I don't feel like going to office. In fact I don't feel like doing anything. You're confused. Have you forgotten that you're getting married next week? Now you're not alone, the bride, her family, your family, everyone is involved in this. This is not fair to talk like this when so many people are involved in it. This is selfishness. This is not fair. I mean if they're not involved in it, is it okay to you? What are you saying, rajesh? No, I don't like. This is not fair on your part to speak like after all this. What has happened to you? I'm totally confused. Ever since I came to know about you both... I tried a lot. Please don't say like that radhika. What the hell you want anyway? You didn't want her when she loved you, but you want her now. You'll not get the kick if you see the glass. You drink to get the kick. Look rajesh... Ow can you get how what you rejected earlier? What bothers you man? You'll not get the kick as soon as you drink. Take time. It's between me and radhika, you don't interfere in t. I don't know all that, you and radhika mustn't talk to each other, since she proposed to me first, I think you must give her up. Don't talk nonsense, bloody! Jay, they've fixed my marriage. What are you saying, anu? What happened? Without informing me, they arranged my engagement last week. I don't know... next week they're marrying me off. It's all over! Father. Let me talk to him once... Ti want leave. A personal emergency. Today! Who will do your job then? Whether you like it or not, I'm taking leave. First finish the job entrusted to you. I'l think about it then Where are you? Please don't cry. I'm back! Leaving to annavaram. Any contact number to reach you? Give me uncle's number. No problem, please give. I'll take care of it, first give me his number. I'll meet you in annavaram. You come here and help him. Uncle, I' m Jay here. Tell me. What's there to tell? Why uncle? I don't have to explain you. You're right, you don't owe any explanation. How can you fix without giving me any chance? What are you saying? What are you saying? I gave you 6 months time, what did you do? Please don't do 1t uncle. Already it's too late, cut the line. Look, I'm very patient with you, please don't call again. I'll not disturb you again. But please allow me to talk at least once with an... Impossible. I'll never show up again in this life. 10 minutes. Uncle please, I'll marry her right now. Think about it. You should've got this sense earlier. Please tell him, aunty. Our lives will change forever after this day. 8 minutes! How are you? Come with me. Why not? I've called my friends, they'll be here in 10 minutes, they il handle uncle and aunty, we cah go away. If I go with you, they've threatened to kill themselves they'll threaten but never do it, you know that. You don't know about my father, he'll do anything for honour. How then? I cant even touch you. Please come with me, an... Get into the car. Sorrow, thy name is veda... Sadness, thy name is hymn... You're my life... You're my first monosyllable... The horrible past will not appear before you... Her breath will not caress me... This is death indeed I can never see my lover's mock anger... Who is god up there to write our fates? He has no mercy on me, I don't know why... It's a tale of tear filled pair of eyes of two people... Heart is still missing a beat with lover's memories. Please don't hang the phone. Please talk to me once. Tell me. I still feel I need you. Like eye ball... Like a tear filled song... What happened in a split second? I feel pity thinking about anu's life. Rajesh spoiled his own life. Nothing like that, such people live happily in life. Varun and radhika would forget rajesh in few days. By the way, what happened to Jay? Shall we go? What would happen to the falling rain drop? What would happen as today turns tomorrow? What would happen to the flowing rivers? What would become of people as story changes? Say no or deny it... Whatever you may say... Till time changes the course...
