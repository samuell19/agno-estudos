Tanny is a myth. She dated the greatest choreographer of all time. She was at the peak of her ability. she was beautiful She was a muse. And on the pinnacle of success she fell down. Tanny had a very unique sense of music. That's what made her dancing so interesting. I think that's what she was born with. She was tall, slim and rather bony. That's why she moved very differently from the others. She covered the whole room. She wasn't ashamed to make her legs longer than they already were when she danced. Dancers were usually small and nimble. Stocky and fast. And then she comes, long, graceful, like a path to heaven. Tanny's body was an inspiration for the choreographers. They could create things they had never seen before! There's this famous story. She was a teenager and at the School Of American Ballet. Balanchine was the director of the ballet school, but he did not teach all classes. He was walking down the hall while all the other students were in class, and suddenly there was a young, pretty girl with long legs standing in front of a classroom. She had crossed her arms resolutely. He spoke to her: "Why aren't you in class?" And she replied, "Got thrown out." And he said, "What's your name?" - "Tanni." I was a student at the School Of American Ballet. That's where I met Tanny. She was already a star and I was just a beginner. She was destined for a great career. I loved dancing. I was at the ballet. I thought that would be very nice. I liked it. I also took piano lessons, but I was stupid. One could see immediately: The child can't play, let's let it dance instead. At 14 we became very close friends. She led a very sheltered life. She liked the normality of our friendship. She got private lessons and had a Scholarship for the School Of American Ballet. Tanny didn't socialize too youngsters their age. She longed for it. She longed to break out of this life in a glass house that her mother had built around her. Edith was the paragon of a ballet mother. She mended Tanny's pointe shoes and knitted her tights. They lived in Paris for a while, and that's where Tanny was born. And then they returned to America. I think her parents, Edith and Jacques, broke up when they were very young. I didn't know if they were divorced because Jacques would show up occasionally. But most of the time Edith was alone and a ballet mom. A ballet mother of the first order. When I was 15, I knew absolutely nothing of what a normal girl knew at 15. You know what I mean? For example, I didn't know Frank Sinatra's latest record. I didn't know the popular dances either. But I had gained valuable experience. What an education! While others sat at home, I traveled to Europe. Italy, France... Fantastic! I've met celebrities, been to world-famous theaters, tasted exotic food. And the other girls went to high school at home. At the time I was living in Bronxville. After Tanny got back, she liked to visit me on the weekends. She loved the normal life in my family because it was so different than anything she had ever experienced. My parents were simple people. We were excellently cooked and went to the cinema. THE NAZIS DEATH MILLS I can remember exactly how we went to the cinema again. I clearly remember the newsreel showing pictures of what the Americans had found in the Auschwitz concentration camp. They had photographed and filmed the people behind the bars. We were both totally shocked. Tanny left the cinema hall, she ran out. I followed her and found her crying on the toilet. Your reaction touched me. Of course, I also found these pictures unbelievable and more than one can bear. But I can well remember how strongly she sympathized. In New York we lived a real teenage life. We went to the cinema a lot, we gossiped about people and we started to get interested in boys. Tanny was very charismatic and I knew a lot of men who found her fascinating. From 14 to 17 or 18 we were inseparable. I then moved to Paris and wasn't there when she got sick. At times I thought there might be another life for me too. That I could just get on a train and go anywhere. I would have a job with regular working hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Before my marriage, I dated a few men. I'm with them on different went to parties and saw other lives and that's when I felt that I don't miss it that much. The New York City Ballet is now ten years old. It's unbelievable how successful ballet has been in recent years. To an outsider it always looks very complicated, an almost artistic form of expression. And now it's popular. How do you explain that? I think it's because the dancers are very beautiful. People like to see beautiful dancers on stage and listen to magical music. No matter, wherever. Even in Russia they love good music, despite everything... That's where ballet is at home. And Russia has produced the greatest dancers, including you. Yes, I was born there. But we're trying to perfect the gesture, dancing a little bit better jumping a little higher than normal people do in a ballroom. This leads me to what I actually wanted to talk about. They founded a dance school. They teach. Oh yeah. The school was founded in 1934 and we have many great dancers and dancers produced. Our focus is on young girls. Balanchine was always looking for the next one. There was a little girl in the ballet company that he was very fond of, and he thought, "Let's see how this turns out. I'll give her a little role. There is this ballerina and the next ballerina, I'm going to marry her and I'll see what I can get out of her. I will choreograph for these, but not for my wife." It was like this all the time. You want to know about his wives? Mr. Balanchine had often complained that Tamara Geva, his first wife, was not a good dancer. But he was young, they were in love, and, voila, they were married. He left Russia and married Tamara Geva, and on the trip to America he met Alexandra Danilova. Her skills corresponded to his ideas of a dancer. So they worked together, he, the choreographer, she, the artist. Then he met Vera Zorina. She was called to Broadway. They became a team and went to Hollywood together. I had often thought that he really loved Zorina. But she single-mindedly pursued her career and he was alone again. He met Maria Tallchief while working with the Ballet Russes. She was a very different kind of dancer. She was fast, technically excellent and very exotic. She was a half Indian, from the Osage tribe. He discovered their special way of moving. And Balanchine developed another new style. Soon she left him for another and he found Tanny. With her he created a new dance style. All women left him. They left him because of career or because of other men. I can't say exactly why. I think it's hard living with a genius. Balanchine needed the unattainable. He had to be inspired by the unattainable. He was constantly looking for a young dancer who could spark his enthusiasm to work with and with which he could achieve his goal. But once he had done that, it was no longer possible. Suddenly he had a real woman by his side, not an ideal. She got pneumonia, had her period and all... In many of his Pas de deux men and women seek each other. You will often find this basic idea in his work. The man is looking for the ideal woman, finds her. They dance perfectly together and then he loses her. Just like in La Valse, a great work of his, created at a particularly important time. With this ballet, Balanchine evoked the very mood in which Ravel had composed the music, between two wars: the First and the Second World War. The last waltz. The fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The end of a wonderful era. death comes seduces her with black jewels. She wears them and puts on the gloves. Death begins to dance with her. And the dance becomes frenetic, wild through the music of the 20s and 30s. Embraced by this whirling figure of death, Tanny suddenly drops dead. Death disappears and so does her lover who is carrying her corpse. All the dancers on stage spin counterclockwise in wild madness. And this is the end. I can't talk about it anymore. People talked a lot about Balanchine's so-called "white" ballet choreographies. But there were also his "black" ballets. I think he had an inkling of what was about to happen to Tanny, and he expressed that in La Valse. I think he felt guilty about the ballet he created for the March of Dimes organization. Show business met to promote the March Of Dimes organization. The figureheads of this action, Larry Mackenzie and Joya Moore raised funds to fight polio at a fashion show at the Waldorf Astoria. Balanchine was asked in 1946 if he would choreograph a ballet for a benefit dinner. Proceeds would go to the March of Dimes, organization dedicated to fighting and curing polio. And he created a ballet that was very reminiscent of La Valse. The ballerina dances happily, but then the mood and the music change and the figure of polio appears. Polio dances a somber pas de deux with her, at the end of which she collapses. In this version there was a happy ending. But Tanny was the girl Balanchine chose from among the students at the School Of American Ballet to dance the victim's part. And, eerily enough, he danced the part of polio. I think Balanchine got into it from day one when Tanny was the School Of American Ballet, interested in her. The interest increased more and more, the more she developed as a dancer. Because of her uniqueness, Tanny only danced solo parts. Watching her made her look more like a model on the catwalk. Nowadays this is no longer unusual for our eyes. Dancers have gotten taller, thinner. They became more what has been called the ideal Balanchine dancer. Tanny didn't have a perfect classic body. And her dance style was elegant and original. Although Balanchine attached great importance to classical music and loved dancers, who could dance the traditional steps in a beautiful way, he was always looking for the special dancers. Those who showed their own personality on stage. They then became his muses. Is there a certain dancer who impresses you, who inspires you? Tanaquil LeClercq. I saw her performance in Symphonie in C. It was at a time when everyone danced them so enthusiastically and I fell in love with this ballet immediately. I cried when Tanny leaned back. I just thought I really wanted to work with this company. Her talent showed in everything. If you look at the roles in this ballet I created for Tanny, think five or six different women would have to dance that. No one could do it alone. Tanny could dance it in concert, in a wild, crazy way very elegant or very classic. She could express all four temperaments. She was a phenomenal dancer. "Dear Tanny! Today I realized how much you are on my mind. I bought something in Florence, something completely nonsensical. I looked at it and thought how fun it would be to show you. How much you would love it and how you would enjoy it as much as I do. In fact, whatever I see or happen to me, I imagine that you see or experience it too. And almost subconsciously I wonder what you would think about that. Whether you like it or not. You can tell I miss you a lot." There was also a very close friendship between Jerome Robbins and Tanny. They worked together in the New York City Ballet in 1948, in the very early days of that company's founding. And they already knew each other from the School Of American Ballet. He was a little older than Tanny. Jerry was already famous, he had danced some sensational roles in the American Ballet Theatre, where he was employed and he was on his way to success on Broadway. Though in a sense they were companions and not far apart in age, Jerry was already much higher up the corporate ladder. Back then, Tanny was I don't want to say "shy" because she never really was. But she was the more serious young dancer. She wanted to please, to achieve something. In her eyes Jerry had already made it, he had the success. "Tanny unfolds her dancing quality more and more. She reminds me of a young animal that is slowly developing. Like a clumsy foal that bursts out with elegance and grace. A kind of aura lingers around her. All the ballets I choreographed for the company were always for Tanny." How can you not love the ballerina you dance with? I mean you're together, you feel her weight, smell her sweat, you taste her and dance the love pas de deux. with her Afternoon of a Faun was choreographed for Tanny. She had an incredible undercurrent of eroticism that promised so much. And that was more exciting than anything obvious. Jerry Robbins came up with the idea of ​​the wonderful ballet Afternoon of a Faun from 1912 with young, naive dancers. He choreographed it in a studio clad in mirrors. The artists were dancers and spectators at the same time. A brilliant idea. And everyone could see how beautiful Tanny is in it. She put one on. Tanny had that certain something and knew how to use it. She had an irresistible presence. Tanny knew exactly how to seduce people, how to delight them. She was fascinating. She could charm anyone she wanted. "Tanny I love you so much for your class. She is so real. I often have to close my eyes to so much directness and insight. Are you mad at me because of George, or because of yourself? And how do we feel about each other now?" "I thought we could deal with how we felt about ourselves and about others. Now I don't know. Anyway, I'm staying with George. I love talking to you, playing games with you, laughing out loud. But I love George. Maybe it's because he was there first." "George is your ideal. Good. But don't act like a little kid and expect everyone to be who they are. He is also my ideal. I admire him as a person and as an artist he is a god to me. But how you feel about him influences how you feel about me." Of course she was flattered by Jerry's interest in her. Jerry was certainly in love with her in a way. But everyone had sensed immediately that Balanchine was also very interested in her. So it didn't surprise anyone. I remember that he wanted to give her jewelry and she was so embarrassed that she asked me come along to this posh jeweler. I can't remember the name, but it was Balanchine's favorite shop. He had shopped there for all his old flames. It was inevitable that he would target her, because that was his pattern. It seemed to me that he... I wasn't too thrilled that he focused almost all of his attention on Tanny. Each of the dancers did their best in the hope that the choreographer would notice them. But everyone also knew that each of them did. So they were all always extremely excited and at a high level. I often went to rehearsals. The room immediately overwhelmed you with what was going on. And what also overwhelmed you in Balanchine's classroom was the plethora of perfume clouds. You entered and you were immediately in an explosion of different scents, because Balanchine liked perfume. All the girls dabbed themselves with it, and of course each had a different one. But you could also feel the tension. Almost physical. A pleasant tension. There was only one star in their solar system and that was George Balanchine. Everything Tanny ever said about him testified to her total dedication to him as a person and as an artist. They married New Year's Eve 1952. Allegra Kent, who he was mad about, said so beautifully: "He had loved us all, to varying degrees." Balanchine was fascinated by the unattainable. Of course, Jerome Robbins was particularly kind to her. Balanchine once told me a conversation between Jerry and Tanny sound like birds talking to each other. He meant that he wouldn't understand a word of it. It was their conversation. "Dear Tanny! I got back to Rome yesterday and immediately rushed to the American Express today and found three letters and a postcard from you. I kiss you on both cheeks. I want to see you, tease you a little. I want you to make fun of me or just ignore me. I think of you. Your J." "I hope you are happy. I'm so glad you exist. I wish I... With love, Tanny." I think life around her was getting a little too narrow for her. She had to turn to Mr. Balanchine, to deal with her mother. To do this, she had to do justice to her art. Long hours, long nights. That was her professional life. Tanny always had to be around her husband, who was constantly looking for new people, new challenges. Surrounding herself was her overprotective mother, whose constant presence Tanny wasn't too keen on. We called them the "Royal Family". That was great. - Wasn't that beautiful? - Very beautiful! When you see something like this, you realize how much effort and skill is behind it, to create such a great ballet. Yes, that is indeed true. I would like to introduce you... Especially when you see such a gifted dancing couple. Our prima ballerina Tanaquil LeClercq. - Hi. And our master dancer Jacques d'Amboise. - Hello, how are you? The two most famous and best ballet dancers in our country. Of course we enjoyed your performance! - I've always wanted to know... - You pant. ...how a ballet dancer feels after a performance. wheezing and panting. It was a grand performance. You will soon be opening your spring tour here in New York this year. Yes, next Tuesday at City Center on 55th Street. - Class. - Hope you all come! Other boys and girls can too See you and your ballet company in other cities? Yes, we dance in Chicago too. On the 3rd of April? - Yes. - At the Chicago Civic Opera House. - What are you performing? - The Nutcracker in full length. - Oh, the ballet. A two-hour ballet! With lots of kids! Lots of children, fir trees, snow, everything for the Christmas season. Then don't miss this, boys and girls in Chicago! And then you go on a big tour through Europe? - Yes, we start in August. - Yes, to Vienna, Salzburg... Everywhere. Even to Finland! Thank you for dancing for us and for coming to us. I want to talk about this tour. The schedule was tight. Many of the rehearsal rooms were freezing. We coughed at each other and still danced together. I got bronchitis. And Tanny too. The company danced their last performance in Cologne and they were supposed to fly to Copenhagen the next morning. Tanny and I danced the Afternoon of a Faun and the Western Symphony. Then the curtain fell and I hugged her. I went to bed early. The next day I flew to New York. I wanted to be there when my son was born. So I said goodbye to her. She didn't look well and she was very, very tired and very, very thin. On the trip she had told me in confidence that she would have preferred not to have gone on this tour at all. She and Mr. Balanchine had a home in Weston, Connecticut. She said she would much rather spend longer periods there than be somewhere else almost every day. She felt exhausted. You could see that and there were also rumors that that the relationship between her and Balanchine... ...should be disturbed. The first time she told me she felt sick was on the night of her last performance. I was sitting in her dressing room because I had to mend something I don't remember what it was - and she got ready for Swan Lake. I asked her "How are you?" and she replied: "I feel awful. I'm in pain from head to toe." I offered her a pill that relaxes the muscles. She said, "Oh, yes, give me one!" I remember the evening. We were in Denmark preparing for the Western Symphony. Tanny also had another appearance. She said to me, "I don't know Arthur, I feel so stiff." "No wonder," I replied, "it's cold here, we need to warm up more." Then we went out and danced. The next morning, when everyone got together to take the train to the next venue, Tanny was missing. I got a call around 6:00, 6:30 on the morning we were supposed to continue to Stockholm. I was told Tanny was in the "iron lung", she had polio and was dying. We decided not to tell anyone until we were on the train to Stockholm. Betty Cage, our general manager, informed the ballet management. Because she was so upset and confused, we thought it would be easier for her with the older people to talk about the new situation. I was responsible to talk to the young girls of the ballet company. Then, once we got on the train, it turned out that my task was the easiest. All young girls had been vaccinated against polio. You can imagine the panic otherwise there would have been! Betty had to do the hardest work. Everyone she needed to speak to were Tanny's friends and none were vaccinated. You collapsed. The tragedy of Tanny is huge... huge! She was destroyed as a dancer. And she had this terrible disease, polio! My name is Virus Poliomyelitis. I cause a disease you call "polio." Few diseases have caused such a stir and terror. The polio virus strikes without warning. THE CRIPPERS 1940 RKO PATHÉ Nobody knows who gets sick. Some die from it. When we wanted to start our journey through Europe, we learned about the vaccinations. We all got vaccinated. A day or two before we left, we lined up to get vaccinated. The ballerinas let themselves be given the injection one after the other. There was Melissa and Pat Wilde and whatever their names were. I picked mine up. Tanny was also in line. Suddenly she swerved, came to me and said: "I always get sick on a plane. And if I also got this injection... I'll wait until we get back." The authorities in Sweden found out that we had a case of polio in our company and stopped the train. They sent a medical team and insisted that each of us be vaccinated. Some had two vaccinations. You hoped in God 'cause the show had to go on and you had to make it that everyone remained calm and that no panic broke out. Our dancers and crew were awaiting word on how Tanny was doing. It blew my mind. And probably every dancer who has ever danced. That's why I say it was mystical. Tanny is a myth. She was badly battered, but not dead. But she could no longer move her legs. Polio in 1956. That's what it looks like, that's what it sounds like. You'll hear the breath of life pumping in these tank-like breathing devices. They are called "iron lungs". Tanny was in an "iron lung". Mr. Balanchine stayed with her in the hospital. Even when we finished our tour in Stockholm and returned to New York, he stayed with her in Copenhagen. "Why can't I be brave and strong? I'm so afraid. i cry all the time I can't stop feeling sorry for myself. I keep asking myself: why me? Why polio? I'm rid of my respirator! Forever. You got me out of the Iron Lung today." "Dear Jerry! This is a letter written with the right hand. I keep my hand in place and type and Eddie keeps moving the paper like a typewriter. I tried it first with my left hand like I always write, but it's impossible. The days creep by. It's better now. But in the beginning I had crazy hopes that I would return to New York completely healthy. But that's nonsense." "Now it's a bit of a routine. Breakfast at 8.00 am, at 9.00 am I roll onto my side and my bed is made. At 10 a.m. hot packs, then manipulations, as they call them. mobilization of the joints. After that George and Edith visit me. Then I read or check my mail. Please write to me." "You can tell I'm doing better mentally. It's going slowly. Oh god, how slow! George looks awful." "Dear Jerry! I raised the headboard of my bed further, so I'll write you again, because unfortunately you don't. I WAITING FOR A LETTER. I'm almost sitting in bed, the sisters allowed it. I try to sit alone without support. What a strange feeling. It is very difficult. I feel like a fillet of fish trying to balance on its tail. I'm very famous here in Denmark. My photo was in the newspaper along with Grace Kelly's and silversmith G. Jensen is calling his new collection 'Tanaquil'. My legs are still dead. They are shocked with electric batons three times a week. If only I could feel something inside them, move a muscle! When I think about the past, I cry. She seems so wonderful to me. The future is far away, blurry. Only the present remains for me." "The nurses washed my hair this afternoon. They've gotten very long. I wish they would leave her alone. You don't smell. With love Tan." "Did you know that there are hospital rooms here that have windows to the outside with stairs set up? That way your friends can see you if you're contagious." "Why do all the sisters in Denmark have body odor? I use deodorant, why don't you? It takes me half an hour to wash around the front, then you shoot me on my side and wash me behind. Then comes the lady with the bucket and the turd. She also has body odor. This is really too much!" "I spoke to a very nice woman. She fell ill with polio in Germany last summer. She can already climb stairs, step by step. And she walks, but on crutches. We've talked about the awfully long time it takes to recover. For severe cases like mine, it takes three years or more. I no longer believe that I can become completely healthy. Just a bit. Are you aware that I'll be 30 in three years? Oh I always knew how lucky I was and that something was going to happen to George, mother or me. It couldn't always go on like this, that you only win and never have to pay a price for it. Tan." "Someone came in yesterday. They got a room next to mine. She's very sick. Today she came to the 'Iron Lung'. That still scares me. Three days seems like an eternity to me." "George carries me to the chair. I would almost say he enjoys my condition. Some people seem to like the fact that someone is completely dependent on them. It's pouring down like a summer rain. It has become dark and yellowish in the room." "I went to bed and slept and slept. And had daydreams. The sky I can see is beautiful. With little pink clouds." "I want to tell you something. I feel like I have to tell you something, but I don't know what it is. Really strange. Love, T." She was transferred to a hospital in New York. I visited her there. That was a very emotional moment. Although she could move her arms, she was still in bed. When she saw me she burst into tears and so did I. Oh God. Every doctor at Lennox Hill Hospital told Balanchine that she would be better soon, but not how much better. She would have a window of two, two and a half years in which her condition would gradually improve. But she would never fully recover. Balanchine didn't want to believe that ...don't accept. He got angry. "I will make her well, she will be able to dance again!" He traveled to Warm Springs and did everything in his power. He did exercises with her. He bent her legs, straightened them, like a therapist. He put her down, hugged her tightly from behind. He was shorter than her. He picked her up and placed her numb right foot on his right foot and her left on his left. So he practiced with her. He hoped this would ignite a spark in the muscles, that they would remember how to walk. "It's beautiful here. So pretty. The houses are made of red bricks with white columns. Georgian architecture. Most here have polio or are paraplegic. Most people are paralyzed after a back accident. Most lying face down at the foot of their stretchers are paraplegics, while the others face up have polio. Today I watched a movie. They have a nice cinema here. The first two rows are reserved for the mobile stretchers. Next row: wheelchairs. Then seats where George and Edith were. We checked out The 12 Jury members. Fascinating! I have a single room With a window just to the right at the foot of the bed. Simply divine! The only catch is that it's a bit noisy because it's adjacent to the room where the bedpans are emptied. People have to do it in the morning, at noon, in the evening." "I always go to the pool in the afternoons now. Wonderful! There are chairs under the water. You sit on it and do arm exercises. I wear splints and a corset and I have my crutches. I find that my mother is doing surprisingly well. Her only daughter, a celebrated dancer, and then: boom! That would have blown me away. But enough of that." "I'm successful! I have groupies! I'm a celebrity, say the ladies in the bathroom. When we get together there with our various ailments, it's funny in a macabre way. But that's my sense of humor." "Dear Jerry! I'm desperate. Why don't you text me? And don't you call me? Full of anticipation, I came to my room after my 10:00 a.m. exercise, and I hated the other letters that were lying there!" "Dear Jerry! You see what a difference one phone call makes! I feel different. Suddenly I love you." "Be in good spirits, Tanny! So much of what's happened doesn't make sense, but never forget that I love you and worry about everything that concerns you." "Dear Jerry! I did a lot of laundry right after you left and smoked cigarettes like crazy. You know: Keep yourself busy and you won't worry so much. I'll think of those two days in the sun before I go to bed so I can dream about them. When I imagine the days and nights that lie ahead, they seem unbearable, not worth living, but you should never give up until you die, right? I'm putting my sunglasses away now. I miss you. With love, T." "I'm worried about George. He mentioned a friend who has a friend who has a piece of the robe of St. Peter or St. Paul. If you carry it close to you and pray, you will be healed. That's not George at all. I'm afraid he has unrealistic ideas about my illness. I told him on the phone I didn't want to hear about it and he sounded deeply disappointed. It's obviously easier to have polio than to be with someone who has it." Balanchine was always close to her. He firmly believed that if he prayed to his icon, she would get better. He was convinced that she would be better, he insisted. She was depressed but he was by her side at the time. There were rumors that their relationship was not going well before she fell ill. But her illness brought him back to her. "I saw the musical On Your Toes on TV, very nice. Also the film You've Never Been More Charming with Rita Hayworth and Astaire. It snowed all day yesterday. It looks adorable today. Being at home is not easy. I think that might be me. It's hard for me to live here. I have to wait for the girl to come and feed me. i feel like a dog Do you think that in the next life I will be human and you will all be animals?" When Tanny was supposed to come home, we had a big problem how to deal with it. The apartment had to be modified so that she could move freely in her wheelchair. But Balanchine even raised a cup rack so she couldn't reach it while seated. He wanted to force her to get up. Once she burst into tears and said: "I can't even get myself a cup!" "I watch more TV. Frankenstein's son. Today it is raining. What desolate weather. I don't have anymore to write, so I'll stop. Tan." Whenever possible, Mr. Balanchine practiced with her. He put together Pilates exercises for her and forced Tanny to make them. And not to forget, he kept moving her legs. They weren't rigid, they were flexible. Her motor memory had forgotten the walking movements. Mr. Balanchine was very interested in the Pilates method. He knew Mr. Pilates personally. He created special exercises for her himself, which she completed alone or with him. Agon was the third part of a trilogy. Balanchine began with Apollo, in 1928 then followed Orpheus and in 1957 the trilogy ended with Agon. With the pas de deux I had to bring the ballerina into new positions all the time. That was the exciting part because I moved her body, her feet and her legs. I took her body and placed it. I'm sure he got the inspiration from his daily practice with Tanny. I'm sure Tanny, as I know her, resisted these exercises at first. But she was strong willed and eventually accepted them. She had no choice. He made her do it. And Balanchine was not so easy to beat. "We're in the middle of ballet season. I should be excited. But I'm not. And I don't feel for George either when he calls. C'est la vie." You can imagine how difficult it was for her to have her body changed by polio. At first she gained a little weight, all the muscles in her legs shrank. It's certainly tough for anyone, but for a dancer whose body is her everything, it really is incredibly difficult. She was no longer interested in going to a ballet. But suddenly she changed her mind. So I got the car, carried her in, and we drove to a ballet. And we saw La Valse with the wonderful dancer Sarah Leland. Afterwards she criticized them. She was asked if she would like to train some dancers in her star roles. She enthusiastically agreed. She was back in ballet and she loved it. When I saw Symphonie in C I noticed that some things had changed. I couldn't say that was wrong, because I didn't know if Balanchine made it specifically: "I hated how Tanny took that step, but now I got rid of her and found another one, and can finally make it dance the way I've always wanted it to dance." I couldn't say, "No, it wasn't like that!" Maybe it's even better. She said it wasn't bad at all, it was a gift. I asked, "What do you mean?" She replied: "How was it always? We have the Saturday matinee off and George and I I'm eating croissants with butter and enjoying my café au lait when the phone rings. George comes back from the call and says: 'Patty Wilde is injured and cannot dance Swan Lake. do you take over?' 'It's my day off, but I'll go to the bathroom and get ready.' And then she said: "Something like that can never happen again now." you take a cat While you can't train her, you can make her do whatever she wants. I have observed her and been inspired by her. I played with her and she jumped. I developed this jump further. And she even jumped backwards! I was asked, "How did you teach her that?" "I didn't teach her that, she taught me!" What made her so special was her cleverness, her wits. You can find out by reading a few excerpts from her book about the cat or what she wrote in the ballet's cookbook. There she wrote short biographies. She described each individual so appropriately and accurately, as a person and as a dancer. There was always a touch of humor about everything. Mr. Balanchine was getting on in years. He watched his youth fly away and unknowingly sought a way to cope with it. Some take refuge in a relationship, which is not necessarily the healthiest and best step is. He got to the point that he had to admit to himself that he didn't want to be with her anymore. He wanted to be free. Tanny in her wheelchair became a log against his leg. He had done everything for her. She sensed this and took the first step. That was really heroic. It was the premiere party of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Tanny was there, but Balanchine was not at her table. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. Tanny said, "He needs to be free. He needs to be free." Balanchine and Tanny's relationship had deteriorated greatly. I was at my apartment one morning getting ready for work when the phone rang. It was Betty Cage, our General Manager, who said: "Tanny has moved out and is now staying at the Mayflower Hotel." I replied, "Thank you for telling me." Then the phone rang again, it was Balanchine. He said, "I'm staying at the Empire Hotel now." Both had undressed without realizing that the other had undressed as well. I'm sure it was awful for her when he left her and fell in love with Suzanne. And even though Suzanne turned Balanchine down, he was done with Tanny. That must have been very hard. People were shocked when he left Tanny because he stayed with her and had done indescribably much for her. That impressed me very much. He brought her back to life, he made her understand that life goes on for her. It was okay with her that he had to move on now. She was a strong personality. She found that she was independent, that she could socialize with people and entertain them. She was very sociable, despite being disabled by the disease. "Thank you, thank you, thank you for two letters in two days! You're right, something happened, but I don't know the hell what, or where it started, or how it's going to end. It's a bit like our relationship in general. Suddenly you're angry about something, you don't talk about it, but both feel it and you start getting a little mean and teases the other. You know what I mean? Anyway, I love you!" Obviously, the two had a lot of fun together. Of course, he was a very different personality from Mr. Balanchine. Jerry introduced her to many of his friends, who also became her friends until the end of their lives. That led her to Europe. In the summer of 1972, Jerome agreed to direct the festival in Spoleto. I'm sure it was his idea to invite Tanny. Italy is made of stairs, and Italy has the only opera house in the world called "The Staircase", La Scala. The stairs there were very smooth, worn down by feet for 300 years. The small theater was full. We were at the back and the only possible space for a wheelchair was at the exit. This meant that we completely blocked the exit for the visitors. I thought, "I can't stop people, and I don't want them to overthrow Get Tanny and her wheelchair over there. And it's only two steps." Tanny wasn't particularly difficult, but I couldn't find a foothold on the first step and the wheelchair slipped out of my hands and suddenly fell over. Tanny fell onto the marble foyer hallway. I stood there, stunned. Tanny crawled around on the floor, looked at me, and said: "Now fuck me, pick me up!" That broke my rigidity, I picked her up, put her back in the wheelchair and we fled outside. In the end we went out to eat and she ordered a whiskey. Which she never did otherwise. She said it hurt like hell. When she saw my face she said: "Yes, my nerves are still working!" So she was in pain. Her bones had become even more fragile from not being used. Although it was only a minor fall, it was enough to break her knee. I also dropped them once after we drank too much champagne. She just giggled. You could easily pick them up. Balanchine showed me how to do it. Once you've learned it, you've got it. She did everything alone. She went to bed on her own, got up and washed herself. She could do a lot on her own. She was strong, she had a strong upper body. This and her indomitable will to live independently helped her to the end of her life. And she has, for the last 25 years. Edith lived not far from Tanny. Tanny visited her occasionally, although they had a difficult relationship. Especially since her mother thought that Tanny's illness would bring her daughter back to her. "I have her back, I can take care of her, visit her every day and cook for her." That's exactly what Tanny didn't want. She was rude to her, but she had to be, otherwise Edith would have moved in with her. Tanny wanted her independence. Balanchine had encouraged Arthur to founding his own ballet company, a black company. And Arthur found rooms in Harlem. Roman, if you do this again, don't let your arms down. Hold her tight. Remember, you want it and you don't want it. We were in a restaurant. I sat at one table and she at another. I went up to her and said, "Tanny, why don't you teach? You have all the knowledge and you know all the tricks." She replied, "No, no, no!" "But you can, use your wits!" She said no again. Finally she asked for time to think about it. I think she then spoke to Balanchine and Jerry about it. I said to her, "Just try it." From then on she came regularly. She zipped around the studio in her wheelchair. Mr. Balanchine gave her all the exercises and dance steps to take with her. My two tutors, Lydia Abarca and Virginia Johnson, learned everything they could from Tanny. Clearly, the person who saved her was Arthur Mitchell. Balanchine would never have allowed her to teach American Ballet in his School Of And she would have loved to do that. She would have been a wonderful teacher for all classes. But he didn't even want her near the school. He would have been embarrassed if she was in a wheelchair would have shown up at school. Arthur Mitchell said: "We'll do it now! You teach with me. We'll get someone to pick you up. Don't worry, we'll take care of you." Many dance teachers cannot dance every step themselves and use their hands for it. They do like this: One, and two, and three, and four. They demonstrate with their hands how to perform the steps. Tanny was very skilled. She performed movements with one hand so quickly and gracefully that one would think she was using both hands. She was so fast that you didn't even notice that one hand wasn't working properly. She was tough. She said, "No, I want it that way!" She was reserved by nature. But certainly a bit spoiled by her looks, her skills, her intellect. And that didn't go away either. This familiarity was her salvation. She got selfish. "I want to live!" It's self protection. And she was tough! When you love someone, you have to accept that. She was more mellow than short-tempered. There were no questions and no accusations. As far as I can remember, there has never been a specific incident. She never said Jerry did or said this or that that upset her. To my knowledge, that never happened. To be honest I never understood why she didn't want to spend more time with him. Tanny's relationship with Jerry Robbins was both hot and cold. He drove her insane for doing only what pleased him. Sometimes he was there for her, sometimes not. I think she was fed up with him putting her on a pedestal and kept telling her how wonderful she was. She didn't really like his ballets. I hope she didn't tell him that too many times. The only ballets the ones she loved more than anything were George's. He was the only person she ever loved with all her heart. After Suzanne Farrell's marriage to Paul Mejia, I think George came to his senses. I don't know if you should send this... In any case, a different life began for him now. And when that happened, he started visiting Tanny. Especially in Weston. I remember he came into Weston once and cut all the lilacs down to about a foot and Tanny was angry. It took her a long time to accept her illness. That acceptance was coupled with deep, personal reflections on what was truly important to her in life. And I think there was also a spiritual dimension to the way she thought about something. Balanchine kept talking about it, calling himself a servant of God. As if he were a priest - which in some ways he actually was. To some extent, that shaped Tanny's feelings and thoughts as well. And in the last letter I got from Tanny, while George was in the hospital, she wrote: "The nurse said he knows exactly how he is. He can speak, hear, feel. She handed him the phone and I heard her say: 'It's Tanny.' I said hello and so did he. I said, 'I want to visit you.' And he said: 'Good.' Then I said, 'Goodbye, I love you.' And he said, 'I love you.' The last time I was with him I talked a little and when he fell asleep he was holding my hand. With love, Tanny." Although their marriage failed, the deep respect took hold for George Balanchine, crowned by love for him, never fails at Tanny. In addition to being a husband, ballet master and choreographer, he was the guiding light of her thoughts and heart throughout her life. For years, many people, including myself, have dreamed of her, and she has always been able to walk. Always. Doctors had told Balanchine that Tanny wouldn't live to be more than 40 or a little older. But of course Tanny lived much longer. She turned 71. That was due to the athletic training of a dancer, to a tremendous will and also a little bit about her stubborn nature. And those were the very things Tanny had had since she was 14, arms crossed, telling Balanchine, that she had been kicked out of class. She had the gift of living in the moment. Where did this gift come from? Maybe from her parents, George Balanchine, God, life in the locker room and ballet school. Everyone there lives at the moment. You know from the start that nothing lasts forever, nothing lasts long. It's all very strange. You start at a young age, then you learn your techniques and it's all downhill. The arabesque doesn't work that high anymore, your knees bend. When you're over 30, you don't see things the way you saw them when you were 24, 25. Really not. Some people can do it longer. Some, of course, shorter. But that's one of the terrible things in life. At some point you get to that point and you come to terms with it. I think she's come to terms with it. Like all dancers. "I'm not a dancer anymore, who am I now? I'm not a dancer, what am I?" When she fell ill again towards the end of her life, Jerry Robbins tried his friendship and to express love for her. And she was grateful to him for that. "I had a dream about Tanny. I looked at her. She radiated acceptance and forgiveness. I said, 'Tanny!' Then I walked over to her, put my arm around her and kissed her on the lips. She was young and old, thin, sad, with clear eyes and, oh, so cuddly. I looked at her again and noticed that other people were standing around us. I kissed her again, passionately. I was home."
