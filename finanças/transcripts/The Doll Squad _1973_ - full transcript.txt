[indistinct speaking on radio] [indistinct speaking on radio] Status check. (Man on radio) Affirmative. Telemetry and logistic condition? Affirmative. Vessel and DC? Affirmative. Pressurization complete? Affirmative. T minus 60 seconds and counting. Status check: ring safety right arm on? Affirmative. Rings ready? Ready. I know, I am sorry. The senator isn't taking any calls right now. Alright. Morning, Nancy. Is he in? Yes. He's expecting you. Just a moment. [knocking on door] Senator, Mr. Connelly's here. Hey, Victor. Come in. Should I continue to hold the calls? Yes, Nancy, thank you. Alright. Problems? No. Pretty smooth so far. [indistinct speaking on TV] (Man on TV) So long, honey. Take care. (Man #2 on TV) Minus ten, nine, eight Four, three, two, one-- [rocket engine ignition start] [zip noise] (Man #3 on TV) Are you watching closely, Senator? Next time perhaps you'll listen. [zip noise] [explosion sound] [static noise] Oh, my God, I killed those men. Senator, I just heard what happened. It's awful. We've got work to do. Yes. We'll be in the computer room, Nancy. We'll get a replay on the countdown tapes. With the computer cross check on all systems in sync we'll screen videotapes of all personnel that entered the restricted area in the last 48 hours. But first, Bertha here will tell us which department can put an effective stop to this killing and sabotage. Bertha, baby, I don't have much to go on. Here it is. The first screwy threat we got. Now a recording today from your TV set. Next time perhaps you'll listen. What's all this? Tab cards on every active agent on the CIA raw script. [printer buzzing noise] [electric typewriter noise] [music playing] I got your message. What is so bloody important that you took me up to next fill assignment? I was in the air, looking forward to it. Star-Flight 12, Sabrina, blasted right up in the air. When? Just now. Oh, my God, those men! First of all, you two haven't been really introduced. Senator Stockwell, Sabrina Kincaid. The Senator as you may know is the head of the Senate Defense Committee. And personally pushed through the entire Star-Flight program. Yes, I have been quite aware of the Senator's program. It's been pretty much publicized. But what we haven't publicized is this. I need the microfilm plan of anti-ballistic missiles with cape warhead. Messenger will arrive Thursday. If I do not receive microfilm there will be a national disaster on following Tuesday. Do you think this is the national disaster he was talking about? Or could have just be a coincidence? When we were watching the lift off, the Senator's TV screen was scrambled. We checked. Nobody else received that transmission except us. A voice came over. The first thing it said was "Are you watching well, Senator?" And then I managed to tape this. Next time perhaps you'll listen. Play again. Next time perhaps you'll listen. I know that voice. I'd swear to it. Can you place it? Not quite, but I will. What about the messenger that was supposed to show up last Thursday? Did anyone arrive? [intercom buzzing] Yes? Nancy, would you bring in the messenger who arrived last week? [pigeon cooing] A pigeon? Is that all? It was carrying a small metal container. It's about the right size for a microfilm. How did it get here? Nancy got a phone call Wednesday, while I was at lunch. A man told me to keep all the windows open in the west side of the office. And he said if this bird didn't get back then he would send another one in exactly two weeks and if that one didn't get back, then-- the Senator would have to blame himself for whatever may happened. What do you think he'll do next? We don't know. Thank you, Nancy. Alright. Hmm. A bird yet. Tell me. If this was the only set that received the transmission could have been-- We've already checked. If they've run electronic gadgets, they're gone. [phone ringing] Yes, Mr. President. I understand, Mr. President. Yes, you have my debt perfectly clear Mr. President. May I ask a favor, sir? Before you announce the suspension of the Star-Flight 12 program indefinitely would you give my Committee a little more time to investigate some information that has just become available? I think so. Two weeks? Thank you, Mr. President? So-- President has given you two weeks. And so is our fine feathered friend. Well, I guess I'll better get to work. There's a list of the personnel in the computer picked from the Doll Squad. Oh, Carol Pierce, Charisse Mitchell. Two very good girls. I suggest to start with them. They both worked space flight security before. Well, I'll be in touch as soon as I round up the girls. Gentlemen. [yelling] [music playing] [yelling] Looks like you're getting quite a workout. Can say either. By the way, the meeting tonight, can you make it? Woman's Limb meeting? Mr. Cogney presiding? Of course he is, doll. Nine o'clock at the Firing Flame? I'll be there. Good. How about a workout? No, thanks. I'll be getting plenty of that later. Ciao, Carol. Ciao, baby. Alright, girls, let's get back with it. [music playing] I want you with me, since you have worked space security. I see. Ever need it? I'm never without it. But I keep hoping that I won't need it. So-- I'm counting on you to be at the meeting tonight. Nine o'clock at the Firing Flame. Okay? Okay. [silenced gunshots] [yelling] [silenced gunshot] [silenced gunshots] [piano music playing] (Man) Excuse me. Come on, pretty, let's go. Split, little man. I have a date. Yet two dates. One, with the black belt chick. And this one. See? [laughs] Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go! Could I at least have a cigarette before I go? Pick it up. Go. Stick it in your mouth. Stick it in your mouth! Come on. [laughs] [crying] [car engine starting] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] [tires screeching] I penetrated just about every area of our security. Any explanations from you two, experts? We lost two experts last night, Senator I came damn close to making a three. That's why I asked for a meeting here today. Not only has your space program been infiltrated, but so is your own office. You see, both messages came to your office and your TV monitor received the ten-four. You got a pigeon sitting in your office, Senator. I am afraid it doesn't have wings. Another one due in two weeks. Pull. [gunshot] We know just how rough they are playing now, Senator. We also picked up a little more information last night. Pull. [gunshot] I had our people pick up those two men last night. Both DOA. The police sergeant made a fast check. And found that both men had silver disks implanted in the back of their necks. What the hell does that mean? I'm afraid it means that... one of our agents could be trying a switch. Pull. [gunshot] We came on a group about three years ago. Setting up agents around the world, trying to start massive student unrest in the major cities. The infiltrators identified each other by implanted silver disks in the base of their skull. A signal from the disk told the agent he was with a friend. Pull. [gunshot] Do you think is the same group? That's impossible. We found their list and we busted every one of their agents. One way or another, there aren't any of them left. But, in breaking up that conspiracy we had to make our own agents aware of the disks. There was a verbal only, top secret communication. Only to our agents, nothing about the disks was ever put into writing. Well, then it's a coincidence. Hardly. Pull. [gunshot] Pull. [gunshot] Take it easy, lady. You'll live longer. What time is it? One ten. I got a meeting at two. I got to go. Senator. From here on, in this complete security you won't know anymore than is absolutely necessary. Knowing Sabrina, I probably won't know much than you do. Unless she asks for help, it's her ball game. Look, after what happened last night I you sure Sabrina can handle this? Show him. [zipping sound] [whistling] Jelly ignite grenades, with time fuses mini cameras with instant developing. Altitude bomb. Break away riffle with scope. Lipstick recorders. Signal homers. Sabrina's little night cap. Nitrous light. Is odorless and is tasteless. Just mix it with alcohol and drink it and it's one for the road, all in little pieces. You mean it explodes from inside the body? Highest explosives we've got. It might mean I'd not have a drink with you. Oh, not to forget my little ring. Filled with highly concentrated Mace. And if I set the time device here the whole thing becomes a scatter bomb. Would you like a demonstration of my little game, Senator? No. You have my vote, Sabrina. I am sorry I doubted you. Is there anything I can do? Well, as a matter of fact there is. I would like access to the computer room. I got a couple of ideas. You've got it. [electric typewriter sound] The sweet little Nancy. I had a feeling it was you. Where's Eamon O'Reilly? I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, yes, you do. Don't lie to me. That was his voice on the tape after you rigged the Senator's TV monitor Where is he? I don't know. Sweetie, this is just the beginning. I can think of all kind of little games to play if you really want to. Now tell me! Where the love of your life sagged? He'll kill me, I can't tell. No sooner than I will. Look. Tell me where he is and I'll see if you can get protection. If you don't, you won't need protection, 'cause I won't let you walk out of here alive. Which is it? On an island somewhere. What's the name of the island? I don't know. I don't. Where is it? What's the name of the island? What is it? San Lorenzo, near Curacao. Off the coast to Venezuela. That carrier pigeon was trained to fly to the roof of Nancy's apartment. And sweet little Nancy was going to take the microfilm of the anti-ballistic missile plans hop a boat and bring the plans to Eamon, all with a cute little kiss. Nancy, I don't understand. How could you end up mixed with something like this? I still don't think I've done anything wrong, I love him. Senator, sex and security just don't mix. Sabrina, when are you leaving? Well, just as soon as I round up the rest of the Doll Squad. And you give me a phony microfilm that only an expert could decipher. I'll take care of it. I'll also arrange an island contact for you. She's taken something. Quick. [coughing] Cyanide. Is nothing anybody can do. The sooner you're on the way, the better. Yes, sir. Your library card, please. Of course, it's right here, in the book that I'm returning. I see. Thank you very much. You' re very welcome. [music playing] [audience applauding] Great show, Velle. Big Red, what brings you to Vegas? Fun and games? Games? Come on in. [band playing] And apparently, Eamon would offer a fortune for the anti-ballistic missile plans. Oh, you got quite an operation going. And with the chosen ones to stop him. Well, that's what the computer said. It seems to pick up something in Eamon's personality that experienced women should do the job. What it is that I just can't pinpoint? Well, big Bertha's never wrong. I hope. Who briefs us? I do. Instruction downside. Thanks. And by the way, Lavelle, please. Don't try to contact me before the rendezvous point. We've already lost two in the preliminaries. Carol and Cherisse. A the matter of fact, Eamon O' Reilly's psychological profile indicates occasional impotence. Which seems to stem from the Oedipus complex. And any man who is thoroughly castrated by his mother is a prime candidate for some psychotic outburst, given the right circumstances to set him off. And since he apparently has been set off... we're not simply dealing with a neurotic. Eamon O'Reilly is a mad man. How was it, Rich? It was 2/10 of a second longer than the last Olympic record. That's not good enough. Competition's really rough this year. Hi, Sharon. Sabrina. Glad to see you in top form. Thanks. I haven't seen you since the blasted U-2 affair. What's up? Another blasted affair. Well, is an ex-agent, Eamon O'Reilly. We think he blows up rockets. Terrific. But I really need you, Sharon. I wouldn't ask you if I didn't. I know. But is there a pool around, so I could practice a little bit on the job? There's the whole bloody ocean out there, Sharon. You can swim to the rendezvous point if you like. But... just be there Wednesday, okay? Okay. They really think that Doll Squad can stop me. They're sending sweet Sabrina. Sounds like you already know sweet Sabrina. As for agent SQ6 who's cover is-- Joseph! Yeah. What the hell was that tape? Want me to play it again for you? Oh, no, just refresh my memory. The tape says that SC6 is under cover at the carnival. There's only one employ who seems to have no past at all. No address, no records of any kind. Her name is Luval. Kim Luval. She's very pretty, Eamon. I'm sure you're anxious to meet her. [glass breaking] Damn it, Maria. Your jealousy drives me insane. Maria... you're useful to me in various ways, but if you wish to remain useful-- Eamon, I love you. If you love me, Maria... then trust me and believe me. Otherwise your usefulness will come to an end. Fascinating idea. Want to go to the carnival and check her? Of course. And see if she is as beautiful as Maria says she is. [carnival music playing] I am sorry, sir, we are closing. We need your help now. SQ6? We? Meaning exactly who? The meeting you are supposed to have tomorrow night at 11. Something happened to SO5 so the others sent me to bring her to them. So what's the problem with this operation? They said they'll identify it when you get there. They're right over there in the parking lots. After what happened to SQ5, they don't want to be seen together. But if you want me to tell them you're not coming-- Wait. There's a gun pointing at you, I've been known to get very nervous when the people don't tell me the truth. Baby, I swear. So, prove it. Over there. [gunshot] You tried to kill me. You tried to kill me. Bitch. [car engine starting] [tires screeching] No. [screams] No! No! Joseph! Stop. This is not an amateur, my dear Joseph. Professionals use violence for a purpose. Not for the home emotional. Subtlety, my dear boy, subtlety. That chick was going to kill me, Eamon. That chick was going to kill me! We're just lucky I brought her back here alive. No, my dear Joseph, you're lucky you brought her here alive. If you hadn't I would have killed you. Now, get me Dr. Cahaymen and get prepared. Well, Maria. Tonight... you shall have a new face. [plane taking off] Now I just thought that knowing him might somewhat help. It might help, Sabrina, but it also may get you killed. That's true but it's just a chance I'll have to take. Lavelle. You're the best in electronics. Coordinate our homers. So that we can all may contact. This? I take everything that I can think of about Eamon's personnel. Play it back and see if there's anything that can help us. Right. Do you know where he is, Sabrina? No, but I have a pretty good idea that he's back somewhere up in the hills. Look, Sharon, I want you to follow me tonight. I'm going to be meeting an agent SQ6 by the name Miss Kim Luval, do any of you know her? No. No. I don't either. The Central sent her, I guess that she is okay. But just in case, I want you behind me, alright? Sure. Hi, I'm Kim. Are you Sabrina? I'm sorry. Uncle John sent me. I'm SQ6. You sure picked a great contact point. Let's go talk in my car. Uh... my car. How many others are with you? Enough. No one you know. And what have you found out about Eamon. Do you know where he is? That's what you were supposed to find out for us, Kim. But I wasn't able to. Don't you have any other island contacts? Anyone that could help us find him? Then how do you plan to find him? You've been asking one too many questions. Get over there. Just as I thought. Get in the car. Go on. [hitting noise] Joseph to Eamon. Joseph to Eamon. (Eamon on phone) Come in, Joseph. She questioned Maria and took off with her. You know what to do. [laughs] Right. [explosion sound] You're doing very, very good, Maria. Now, tell me... where is Kim Luval? She was with Eamon. Then they took her to Dr. Cahaymen's office. I knew Dr. Cahaymen was involved in this. Maria, show me on the map where Dr. Cahaymen office is. Here. In the town. That's excellent, Maria. Now I want to ask you one more question. What is Eamon going to do if he doesn't get the microfilm for the missile plans. Yes. I can't. I can't. Maria, you don't have to answer the question. You don't have to answer the question. You're relaxing, you're letting everything go. You're getting into a very deep sleep, you can't hear anything. You did very good. Here is the doctor's office. And this is Eamon's place right there. It's clear across the island. It's on the Windward side and deserted according to this. Look, I want you to bring her down to the garage in ten minutes. Put the mask on her. We're going to get Kim. And also I want you and Lavelle to go into town and hit some of the bars and get us a boat. [whispering] Kim. Kim is me, Sabrina. SQ5. [phone ringing] She is no longer needed. I am sure Maria has everything precisely under control. You may dispose of the girl at once. [gunshots] Why hasn't Maria contacted me? [people laughing] Here they are. Here. Hey. Good. You made it. Come on in. Let me help you. You're just the rest of you party? Do you always sneak upon people like that, captain? Forgive me, is a bad habit. Are you ready to leave? Anytime. Prepare to shuffle off. Ay ay, Captain. [indistinct speaking] [car engine starting] SF8-74. KFF 0607. To island base, come in. Captain, we'd like to take the skiff to the island. When you reach a point near this cove. We're practically there now. Are you sure you can handle that skiff alone? You won't lose your boat, if that's what you mean. We'll just going to do a little rock cutting. Can you guarantee paying for it if you wreck it? Oh, absolutely. I'll get as close to the beach as I can. Thank you, captain. Well, we land here. Seems to be plenty of cover. And according to Maria, Eamon will be about five miles off that cove. I wonder where Cat and Kim are now. I wonder what are they doing. Hi, fellows. What are you, girls, doing here? We've just been doing a little rock cutting. I've never heard of anyone doing any rock cutting out here. Well, sure, that's why we came here. It's called virgin territory. What do you mean virgin territory? Listen, you guys, I got to get out and stretch. Yeah, it is so trapped in that jeep. Wow, am I hungry. I am too. And thirsty. You fellows must be thirsty. It's so hot out here. Let's see what little girls take along with them when they go rock cutting. Oh, look here, group. Cookies. Would you, fellows like to share some cookies? Well, I bet you boys haven't eaten all day. You're right, we haven't. Hey, fellows. How would you like something stronger than a cookie. Now, doesn't that feel good? Hits the spot. Sure does. Drain or no. Drink a little more of that. One more swing. Good for you. Hey, how about that, huh? I don't feel so good. Neither do I. I got just the thing, fellows, in the truck. Just a minute. Hey. [explosion sound] [explosion sound] Captain. The girls said you to go back to the city and come back in two days. Two days, are you sure? They're going to stay out there with no food or shelter for two days? That's what they said. I'm a little worried about that. I should follow them. I thought I was supposed to be their guide, right? Good idea. Listen. I'll come back tomorrow afternoon and check on them, just to make sure. Tell them if they want to come back with me to meet me on the beach at noon. Alright. Collision course are headed right for them. [walkie-talkie signal] Take cover. (Man on speaking-tube) Give your self up now and you will not be harmed. We know you are here. Give yourselves up now and you will not be harmed. They are to your left, girls. Come on. [beeping noise] He's okay. Take me to Eamon. Very good work, Mr. Cahaymen. Oh, Rafael, you are finally back. Yes, I need to refill my prescription. Oh, yes. Your prescription. Oh, right now I am busy with my rats. And Dr. Cahaymen is busy initiating a new guard. I need them. I know you do, my boy. You will have them. After you bring me the girls. I did. I did. Mr. Cahaymen. Will you take care of the poor boy, please. Eamon to Leader One. Come in, Leader One. (Man on radio) Leader One. (Eamon) Have you found the birds? (Leader One) No signs of them. Search continuing. Switch to wrist communication. Rafael will contact. Leader one, synchronize sonar radar scan. [static noise] This is Leader One. We are synchronized to your scan. We will follow you. Out. Rafael. After you bring me the girls. This one is finished. Now remember. When you wish to identify a friend stand facing the person directly. Press the button. [beeping noises] If there is no signal... shoot to kill. Now join your group. Well, gentlemen. We had best prepared to welcome the ladies. Eamon may see you and think that you are Maria wearing the mask. Yes, so why can't I go on ahead and keep him busy while you, guys, move in? Because if you couldn't take your mask off, he kill you, that's why. Oh, I can take care of myself. Sure you can, honey. Just how many jobs have you been on? So this is my first. It will be your last if you're getting more crazy ideas. Rafael, what are you doing here? I thought to follow you. Why? It's pretty dangerous on this side of the island. I don't know what you girls are into, but I just saw a whole bunch of men with machine guns-- Where are they? Over there. You better follow me. Come on. (Man on speaking-tube) Stop where you are. You're surrounded. Do not attempt to escape or you will be shot. [car approaching] Okay, let's move out. This way. Move out. Move. [intercom buzzing] Yes, what is it? (Leader One) We brought in the prisoners. Do you have your orders? Yes, sir. Guard. Guard! Guard, tell Eamon that Maria is here. His Maria. Eamon sent me to bring them to you. Unchain me and take me to you. [moans] Sure I will. [crying] You stupid kid. I only tried to get us out of here. Why didn’t he believe me? Because Maria has a silver disk in her neck. If you were Maria, it would give the guard a signal. I am sorry. [silenced gunshot] [silenced gunshot] [silenced gunshot] [silenced gunshot] [silenced gunshot] [moans] [beeping sounds] We came for the one named Sabrina. Didn't you mothers teach you manners? [silenced gunshots] The guns. I'll catch you up. [shouting] Sabrina, let's get out of here. [machine gun shooting] [screams] [gunshots] [silenced gunshot] [machine gun firing] [machine guns firing] [gunshot] [explosion sound] Damn! I want you to get them and get them all. Go. Keep Sabrina alive. [gunshot] [crying] [machine gun firing] [Sabrina moaning] No. [yelling] [gunshot] [gunshots] [moaning] Girls, I have the Jelly at the end of the walkway. Alright, let her go. You can leave us now. Sabrina. Is it really you? Is it really you, Eamon? I can't believe that you're the same man that I-- Oh, it's all begriming to make sense. Two Cahaymens. Everything... You planned it all. Why? Why? Now you're being the hard, the tough Sabrina. When I remember the soft, the sweet Sabrina. And I can remember a different Eamon, too. A loving Eamon. A gentle Eamon. And now...all this. This? This is my glory, my kingdom. With these I will be king. Eamon-- It's alright, doctor. You don't know this woman. She can be glorious. Eamon, you are making a mistake. Are you doubting me? I never make mistakes. Do you understand that? What is it, Eamon? What is it that made you change? This. Dr. Cahaymen and I have isolated a virus strain. This is the end results. Ready for distribution. Distribution to whom? To the world. Through agents we have in key cities throughout the world even now, as we speak, Sabrina. Come, my dear. Sabrina, do you know what it is to heave wealth? Not just money. But real wealth. Never to have to work again. Never to have to kill again. That's what I really want, Sabrina. It's a worthy ambition. What you have means cheating, Eamon. How many people have you killed to get your wealth? Oh, they don't matter. All that counts is me and you, if you want to share it. You mean... you want me to be part of this? I want you to be my queen. I want you with me always. And to take care of you? The way I did in Germany? Then tell me Eamon. What is the virus that your agents are distributing? A key to Empire. Bubonic plague. Injecting rats with the plague. Nobody will be expecting it. But a dramatic way to make one want more. And just what are you wanting? Well, Sabrina, countries always want something from other countries. For instance I have buyers who want the missile plans from your company. I have buyers that want political prison through these. I have buyers that want gold bullions to make their countries reach again. All of these will make us rich. Once my rats are nibbling on flesh throughout the world. I will be getting everything I want, Sabrina. Eamon, I have to talk to you. The girls are loose in the compound and no ones knows where. If it isn't the swinging little junky who was going to save our lives. The agents are here, they are coming over. They are waiting. We'll have to brief them. Please, forgive me, my dear. The men are waiting to return with their little packages. Take her to my suites. And treat her like a princess. I will be with you shortly. Creep. Move, come on. I said stop it right away. [gun shots] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] Now that you've all been introduced... you can realize the scope of our mission. The fact that we cannot fail. When you return to your respective countries, from the operation put into effect we will then control the destinies of Britain, France, Germany, Yugoslavia Russia, China, The United States of America. You will each be given enough virus plague to infect over 1000 rats. As you know, rats have long been the scourge on the face of the Earth. They have been called one of the greatest menaces to mankind because of their reproductive abilities. For which we are thankful. Each rat you infect will intern breed scores similar to the infected rats making our job that much simpler... and massively more effective. [clears throat] Does the representative from France wish to address us? This job we do I realize the necessity I also realize the danger involved to ourselves. We will not be infected? No, you will not. Before you leave here tonight... Dr. Cahaymen will inoculate each of you against the virus plague. Now we know this virus we're dealing with. That's the beauty of our mission. We shall all be immune. But the rats will spread the plague throughout the entire world. The symptoms will confuse and bewildered medical profession. They will discover the cause, of course, eventually but by then, to manufacture a cure for the millions of victims will be a monumental task. Populations of entire cities will drop like flies. What about our families? They, too, will be inoculated? You will be given enough serum for your families. And our friends? Sir! In this business we have no friends. If you think otherwise you had best leave. Now. No, Eamon, no. I didn't mean-- I was simply speaking for others who might have a friend or two I myself, of course, have none. You have noticed these canisters. You will each be given two canisters identical to these. They will be placed in a black case and chained to your left wrist, so there will be no danger of misplacing it. You will be given keys to unlock them once you have reached the safety of your laboratories and are ready to infect your rats. You will also be issued maps as to where to release the rats and how many to be released in each particular area. You are to follow instructions exactly. There are to be no variables, is that clear? And we are ready for the inoculations. We'll begin with Germany. Dr. Cahaymen. [silenced gunshot] Where are Sharon and Liz? Sharon was hit pretty bad. I told Liz to take her to the jeep. I hope they'll make it. Did you manage to plant anything? Yeah I planted full bag of Jelly and the altitude bombs in Cahaymen's briefcase. And I have the place rigged from top to bottom and enough Jelly here to blow this place to Tokyo. It's got to go in an hour. Eamon's got his agents here from all over the world. They're only be here for another hour. Then we'll get them all. If we don't he's going to kill a hell of a lot of people with bubonic plague. [whistling] What time is it? I got 11 straight up. Same here. Give me till midnight. I need some proof to take back. That's the camera there? Yeah, here. Good. If I'm not out here by midnight, blow it. We'll set everything for 12, so, work fast. [moans] Remember me? You burned up my eyes. Do you know what it'll do to your eye? Do you know what it'll do to your eyes? Do you know what I'm going to do to your eyes? [screaming] [gunshots] [gunshots] Bravo, Sabrina, well done. A wonderful exhibition of self-defense. Well, what it will be my dear? Will you rule the world with me or shall I kill you? Why don't you kill me, Eamon? Oh, sweet, you're going to inoculate me with the serum! No, I'm going to inject you with the plague. This last was used on one of my beasts. You would, wouldn't you? Well, you obviously know about the serum, the mission, the plague, I have no choice. But you do, Sabrina. I wish I have the words to make you believe in me again. I wish I could bring back to feelings you once had for me in Germany. That sure will bring back the feelings and make me believe in you again, Eamon. Oh, you are just angry because you felt into the trap. You forget, Sabrina, we've got the same training. Alright, I won't need you for a while. You'll be in my room for a short while. Oh, damn it! [screams] It's only one door. And those windows have a very long drop to the bottom. So if want to get out of here, you're going to need my help. You obviously need mine, too. No lady said that, my pretty. Why else did you wait to kill me? Because, Sabrina, I know you still love me. What we have between us... only happens once in a lifetime. I don't want to use you. I just want to love you. I knew it was still there. I knew you'd come with me, Sabrina. Did you, Eamon? Tell me, Eamon... Do you still have that pitcher of Martini waiting in your room at night like always? Yes, I do. We'll drink to the future. To the future, Sabrina. And to us. To Us, Eamon. Hmm, very nice. My sweet, my love. I wish I could trust you enough to let you live. So, it was all a game. All of life is a game, Sabrina. I just wanted a moment with you. A moment alone before you die. No, I couldn't take you with me. I couldn't trust you, could I? Of course, not. Because the minute you turned your back, I'd kill you. [laughs] Oh, Sabrina. That's why I love you. You could always make me laugh. I know. Let's see. How would I kill you? I'm curious. First of all, I'd have you stand up right here beside me. And if I didn't? If you didn't, then I'd reach over and then I'd kiss you like this. [laughing] Sabrina. That was a good try. What would you do then? I think I'd just give you a little push like that. [laughing] Then I'd pick up the pitcher of Martini-- Oh, you'll drown me with the Martini. That's the way you're going to kill me? [laughing] Oh, Sabrina. [electric discharge sound] Oh, Sabrina, my love. [screaming] [screams] [screaming] Well, then... you did it. We got three minutes. Come on, let's go. [plane taking off] [explosion sound] [machine gun firing] Here. Catch. [explosion sound] Cat. Where are the others? Kim is dead. Sharon was hit. Just took the jeep. Time? Two to midnight. There. [explosion sound] [explosions] How is she doing? She'll be alright. We shouldn't go over. She's going to lose too much blood. Okay, then let's head for the boat. Are you okay? I'll be alright. Where's Kim? She was killed in the shack. Let's move. [car departing] [machine guns firing] [machine guns firing] [gunshot] [gunshot] Girls, bazooka. Ready. [gunshots] Now. [explosion sound] Did you find any rocks? We sure did, captain. What happened to you? She fell. Wasn't there another one with you? She won't be coming back with us, captain. SF8-74. SF8-74. Central, come in, Central. Come in, Central. This is Central. Connelly here, Sabrina. What do you have to report? Situation A OK. (Connelly on phone) What the devil does that mean? It means you can send off your rockets again, chief. And you won't be getting any more pigeons. You can consider it case closed. I'll be giving you the details when I get back. That will better be tomorrow. Tomorrow, why? Because the computer just came up with you again. (Sabrina on the phone) You can just tell that computer to go chase itself around-- [beeping sounds] and go stuff something up a tree and furthermore-- Hold it, hold it. This is Stockwell. How much time would you like to have off? I think I can handle your boss. A week, Senator. Just to remind myself I am still a lady. You've got it. Thank you, senator. I owe you one. Are you ready to go back to town now, miss Kincaid? No, I think we'll stay on for a few days. Just take us wherever do you think is pretty. That must be a nice way to live. You ladies just go with no constraints, relax. Yeah, relaxing. Yeah, it's a very nice life, captain. ♪ Forever ♪ Is never ♪ When I never show, ♪ when we will touch again. ♪ Forever, ♪ Is a word on your tongue. ♪ A song and the songs ♪ are soon forgotten. ♪ The world that we share, ♪ could be so the uncompare. ♪ But you won't stop long enough to be mine. ♪ You have dreams and desires ♪ of a woman in love. ♪ But you won't let yourself go to find it. ♪ The puzzle, ♪ The pieces, ♪ I can't make them fit ♪ To tell me who you are. ♪ I'd hold you, ♪ But you're not near enough ♪ For you are that unreachable dazzling star. ♪ The world that we share, ♪ could be so the uncompare. ♪ But you won't stop long enough to be mine. ♪ You have dreams and desires ♪ of a woman in love. ♪ But you won't let yourself go to find it. ♪ Sabrina. ♪ Oh, Sabrina. ♪ Sabrina.
