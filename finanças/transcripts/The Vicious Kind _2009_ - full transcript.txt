[bluesy music] - You know they're all whores, right? Yeah. All of 'em. [clears throat] l'm not just talking about the little skanks that hang out around your dorm or your frat or whatever, but actually every woman you've ever known and every woman you'll ever meet. Mom, Grandma, Aunt Ellen. And the fact that they're related to us doesn't make a difference, 'cause at the end of the day, given the right set of events, they will fuck you over for the sole reason that they have a vagina and they can. - Now, can l get you gentlemen anything else? - Coffee. More coffee and, um, l'd actually like some cigarettes if you happen to have them. - We don't sell cigarettes here, sir. - Fine. Coffee, then. And this new one of yours, Peter. Jesus Christ. l mean, you know, you could have at least preyed on a couple high school girls, get used to the thing. And if they fuck you over, well, it's not anything that a night of heavy drinking wouldn't take care of. - She's a good girl, Caleb. - Mm-hmm. Tell me where you met her again? - No, don't do that. - Do what? - What you're doing. Like you forgot already. - No, l know where you met her. l just mean, you know, give me all the details, like we're getting our fucking nails done or something. What the hell is the problem? - How much further do we have to go? - l'm not paying for your meal unless you tell me how you met her, and l don't think they take student loan checks in here. [waitress approaches] Wow, that was fast. Come on. lt would be awful embarrassing, two grown men, one of them has to play dine and ditch. Still waiting. - l met her at the frat house. - Yes, l know this part. - She was seeing a guy there, and l ran into her visiting him. - Mm-hmm. And what did the other boys in the frat house have to say about you seeing her? - How should l know? - Well, l know, Peter, and l was on your campus for 45 minutes. - She's a good girl. She just has- - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, look, l'm just trying to prove your dickhead roommate Pierre wrong. - Pierre said something about Emma? - Don't act surprised. Pierre? The kid's a fuckin' dick. l could tell before l shook his hand. lt smelled like patchouli oil. - lf you're asking if she has a reputation for sleeping around amongst those dickheads- - Well, l guess she did cheat on her boyfriend to be with you. lt's not a promising start. - Okay. You know what? l'm really not even hungry. And l told you my stupid story, so l'm gonna go wait in the car. - Wow. - Give me the keys. - Wow. That's-that's rude. - Yeah, well, you've been rude since you picked me up, so consider us even. Please give me the keys, Caleb. - What do you want, my keys? l think they're in here somewhere. Ah, that's my lighter. Oh, that's my dick. You want to try and open my car with my dick? You know, squish it up against the keyhole? l don't think that's gonna work at all. Oh, here we go. Check and see if they have cigarettes next door? - They're closed. And they don't sell cigarettes anyway. - Well, thank you for that. - Can l get you anything else? - Yeah, you can warm this up, and you can maybe grab my check, if you find the time in your precious little schedule. Fuckin' slut. [building acoustic guitar music] - l had a long - Wrong keys, dickhead. - l had a long [tires squeal] l had a long, long dream l had a long dream about swimmin' Across the sea - Are you not sleeping again? Caleb. - Yeah? What? - How long has it been since you slept? - l don't know. A week? - How safe is it to drive with you when you haven't slept? - l'm not gonna lie to you, Peter. lt's not that safe. [knocking on door] [knocks] - Em! - Hi! - God. - [laughs] l thought l heard knocking, and then l saw your brother's car. That's-is that your brother? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, hi. - Hi. [kissing] l feel like l haven't seen your face in forever. - l know. - Are your folks awake? - Oh, God, no. You know, they're probably still drunk at this hour. - Oh. So should we- should we go? - Yeah, oh, can you help me with that one? - Oh, yeah. l'll take this. - Thanks. - Caleb, this is Emma Gainsborough. - Hey. - Hey, Caleb. - Nice to meet you. Emma. Gosh, l've heard so much about you, l feel like you're famous. - Okay. Are you guys gonna get in, or-? - Yeah, l just thought you two should meet before we all cram in your car. - Well, l am so sorry, your royal majesty. Next time l'll- l'll bring the rolls so you can stretch out. The fuck is wrong with you? - Do you want the window seat? 'cause it might be a little more comfortable since you don't know him. - Oh, no. No, it's fine. - l can, uh, l can totally hear you. FYl. - [continues talking quietly] - l'm right here. l'm, like, four feet from you, so if you want to- oh, you're done chatting? Okay, come on in. - Hi-oh. - This is tough. You might want to- just lifting the leg over is- - Right. - Wow, you're pretty good at that. [engine starts] - [grunting] Whoa! Ready? Sorry. All right, one more, one more. Watch this. Arrr! Kgghh! Sorry. Oh! - Sorry. - That was-l usually put my arm up. - l thought we talked about smoking in the car. - Oh, no, no. lt's fine, honey. - No, it's not, because l know you don't like it, and l specifically told you not to smoke. - Okay, okay, l got it. Take it easy. - Don't tell me to take it easy. - Your parents' home is beautiful, by the way. - Oh, thank you. - Now, do you know the architect, by any chance? - No, l don't. My parents built it before my sister and l were born. - Oh, you have a sister? - Yeah. - l told you she had an older sister. - No, l don't think you did, Peter. The only thing you told me was not to smoke in the car, which l forgot. My mistake. But nothing about an older sister, as far as l remember. - l told him. - That's fine. l don't care. - Anyway, it's a lovely home, and, uh... - Thank you. - And l would love to know who built it sometime, if you're ever talking to your parents and remember. - Oh, sure. - Great. - Yeah. - Thank you. l build homes. l don't know if Peter- he probably mentioned that you. - Oh, no, he didn't. - Well, l didn't tell her that because that's not true. - l'm sorry? - You're a construction worker. - Uh-huh. - Okay? - Yeah, l construct homes. See, the words ''construct'' and ''build'' are synonymous, Peter. l don't know if you don't know that or if you just are playing around. - By asking about the architect and then immediately thereafter saying that you build homes implies that you were an architect which you are not. - Uh-huh. Okay. - Are you gonna be joining us for Thanksgiving, Caleb? - No, no. l'm afraid this car ride will be our only time together, Emma. Unless, of course, Amtrak decides to take every yahoo with a phone seriously when they call in a fuckin' bomb threat. - They'll be running again by Sunday. l already checked. - Let's hope. - Why won't you be joining us? Are you working? - No. - Oh. - My dad and l aren't on the best of terms, so that's all that is. - l'm-l'm sorry. - No, don't be. lt's not a big deal. Okay, who's hungry? l could use a cigarette. [bird cries] - You're not gonna pull up any further? Okay. Well, l guess we'll be going, then. - l got it. Thank you, Caleb. - Hmm, don't mention it. - l think that's it. Okay. - Oh, hey, you guys, if you need anything while you're in town- a ride, you want to borrow some money, a massage, go ahead and ask that fucking asshole Donald. Okay? - Thanks. - Bye. - Do you mind if l move this stuff? - Sure, yeah, that's fine. Just keep chapter seven on top. - Chapter seven. - Thanks. - Hey, you weren't kidding there, boy-o. She's like a little angel. Dark angel, really, which is kind of sexier in a way. - Dad, please, not everybody is as deaf as you are, okay? She'll hear you. - So what? You think a young lady like that doesn't like hearing how goddamn gorgeous she is? Shit, you gotta tell it to 'em every ten minutes. Boy, l bet she's a tiger in bed, huh? - Dad! l really don't feel comfortable with you asking me about that. - All right. Jesus, Peter. When did you become such a stick in the mud? Jeez, you're like my old man. Hey, come on. l'm just breaking your balls a little bit. Come here. lt's just 'cause l'm so damn proud of you. You know that, right? - Yeah, l know, l know, l know. Just be nice to her, okay? - Yeah. - Leave the compliments up to me, okay? - l'll do my best. - The table's set if you guys are ready. - We're sure ready for you, darlin'. No, Emma, l can't believe for one minute that your older sister is half as pretty as you. - Oh, l don't know, Mr. Sinclaire. She's awfully pretty. - Please: Don, Donald, Donny. Anything but Mr. Sinclaire, okay? - Okay, sure. - Does your sister dye her hair jet black like that? lt's very flattering on you with your-with the blue eyes. - You know, Emma's at the top of her class, dad. - You don't say. - Mm-hmm. - What might you be studying, Emma? - l'm a psych major. - Really? So are we all as fucked up as they say? [silverware clatters] - Um... [laughs] Uh, l don't know. Actually, the only thing we seem to be studying is why men hate their fathers and want to sleep with their mothers. - This world needs sharp women, Emma. [bangs on table] l swear to god, every time l turn on the television, there's a woman with something to say, and l'll be damned if l've seen one of them l can listen to for more than five minutes. - Oh, thank you. - You're welcome. [phone rings] - l kn- [rings] Hello. Hello? - [breathing heavily] - l can hear you breathing, Hannah. l know what your breath sounds like. Why are you doing this? - [breathing] - Either say something or don't fuckin' call me, okay? You're torturing me with this. You're fuckin' torturing me. - [breathing] [clangs] [clicks] Hey. Hey. Look-look at the camera. [clicks] [clicks] [clicks] Thanks. [clicks] [doorbell rings] [hammering] - Hey, Caleb. Caleb! - What? - Why are you nailing that hard? Are we supposed to be nailing harder with this one? Hey, you ever watch the Spanish channel that's on your television? - No. - You should. The girls are wicked hot. - You just discovered boners? Discovered, like, what it is, what it means? - No, actually l was watching, uh, that creep show girl, Elvira, when l was little. She had that long, dark hair? - Elvira? - Have you ever seen her tits? - Yeah. And she's, like, 60. - lf you look at the pictures of her when she was younger, and l used to watch it, and l used to think that l wanted to be in that show with her. Like, we could be friends, you know? Like, she could take care of me and stuff and l could hang out with her? - That's quite a fantasy, J.T. - Just-can l tell you the story? - J.T., do you ever just think about the shit you say and-and think, uh, ''Wow, l should definitely kill myself.'' Do you ever think that? [footsteps] [typing] [stops typing] - Hey, Peter, you sure you don't want to use my bowling shoes? - Yes, Dad, l'm sure. - What, is Andy Rooney dressing you now? - [laughs] - Right? Come on, take the shoes. They're just sitting up there in a box. - Yeah, well, maybe you shouldn't have gotten thrown out of the league. - The league president is a total faggot, okay? Now l say one thing, and l mean, literally, one thing as a joke, and l get thrown out of the league. - [laughs] - l'm not a homophobe. Do l look like a homophobe? l love the gays. l mean, not, you know- - Yeah. - Not like- - Yeah, okay, Dad. We're leaving. Go back to your book, okay? l'll say hello to your old cronies if l see them. - At least take my ball. - Dad, l bowl, like, once a year. l don't need a custom bowling ball. - Hey, my ball and l were legends in this town, and it's your responsibility to carry on that legacy. - Bye, Dad. - Bye. - Wait! [door slams] - She's my alibi And she gets me high Well, she's a worker at the grocery And she's to care about only me Baby, get back She's my 9:00 to 5:00 And she makes me smile - Hey, Caleb, l got you a beer. Whoa. ls that Hannah, man? - No. - You know, dude, l think it is. - No, it's not, J.T. And you just shut the fuck up or l'm gonna knock your fuckin' teeth out, okay? - Okay, sorry. l think it's your turn to bowl, though, man. - [sighs] Take my turn. l don't care. - Caleb, it's the sixth inning. l don't think Rocky- - lt's the sixth frame. We're in the sixth frame, J.T. How many years have you been playing this- Here, give me a ball. Here. Yeah? Here. How's that? ls that good enough for you? You asshole. - Do you want your beer? - Where the fuck are you going? - l need smokes. - He's like a goddamn fart in a frying pan. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi, Molly, how are you? - Hi, Caleb. Good. How are you? - Can l just get a pack of cigarettes, please? - Yeah, um, l got, uh, l got menthols. l got, uh- - lt's-anything is fine. - Whatever? Okay. - Yeah, that's- - You're easy, huh? - Yeah. - These menthols. - Okay. - No, no, no, no, don't- don't give me your money. l don't want it. - Really? - Yeah, really. - Thank you, Molly. - You're welcome. - l guess l'll- l'll- l'll see you around. - Yeah, l hope. - Caleb. - Hey. - Hi. - How are you? - Emma. - Yeah, no, l know. l'm- - Oh, you bowl here? - Well, it's the only bowling alley in town, so... - Oh, yeah. - Kind of... - That's true; oh, did you see Peter over there? We're in- we're in lane one. - l did, yeah. - Do you want to come and join us? - No, you know, l'm in the middle of a league match right now, so l'm kind of- - Oh. - lt's fuckin' lame. - [laughs] - But, uh, anyway... - What? - Hey, can- can you tell me why Peter is all of a sudden, he's dressing like, uh, like Mike Wallace or something? - [laughs] - ls he-is he a Republican now or- - Yeah, your dad said something about that too. - Well, no, it was nice to- to see you. - Yeah. Good to see you too. Oh, Caleb, um... - Yeah? - Can l maybe bum a couple cigarettes off of you? - l thought you didn't like cigarette smoke or something. - Well, actually Peter doesn't. l-l smoke. He doesn't really know that, so l kind of sneak a couple at a time. You know. Please? - Sure. How many? - Just two. - There you go. - Thank you. Oh, sorry. lt's just easier to hide 'em there. - l don't care. - [laughs] Oh, and could you just not tell Peter? - Yes, if-if- can you do me a favor and not tell Peter you saw me? - Sure. - Thanks. And don't tell Donald. - Sure. - ls that okay? - Good to see you. - Thank you. Okay. [retching] - That was some disappearing act you pulled on us last night. - Uh, sorry. - Yeah, well, don't apologize to me. Apologize to J.T. He was like a lost puppy dog the rest of the night. He looks up to you, you know. - Yeah. - Hey, look. You want to prove to everyone you're an asshole, fine. J.T. is my nephew. All right? He's a nice kid. He's dumber than rocks, l know, but, uh, he thinks you walk on water, so, uh... Don't be letting him down again, okay? - Sure. - Okay. What are you doing tomorrow night? - l don't know, Rock. Are you asking me out on a date? - lt's Thanksgiving, you dumb shit. What are you doing? - Oh, nothin'. l don't celebrate the fact that my ancestors exterminated a race of people. - Well, l do. My old lady's a hell of a cook. Why don't you come over? - l'd rather not. - l'm not asking. Be there around 7:00, all right? Bring a bottle of wine or something, okay? - All right. - l'm gonna get you fucked up, and l'm gonna send you home with my niece. She's ugly as hell, but she gives great head. - l-l-l don't want to know about that. - Hmm. So l'm told. - Jesus, Rock, just- - Well, whatever, yeah. - Take it easy. - Caleb? Hi. - Hey. We keep, uh, running into each other, don't we? What-what are you doing here? - l'm grocery shopping. l think that's pretty much what everyone's doing here: grocery shopping. - No, that's not what l meant. l meant, l'm sure Donald sent you here. He likes to keep his houseguests busy, so it makes sense. - Are you a big red wine drinker? - What's that? - You like red wine? - Oh, uh, not really. lt's- - l love red wine. - Yeah, me too. - Hey, are you okay? - l'm just- l'm-l'm in a hurry, and l don't, uh, you know, l don't really like it here, and so l'm trying to hurry. - Oh, okay. - Are Donald and Peter here? - Um, no. lt's just me. Are you sure you're okay? - l'd like to talk to you. - Okay. You want to talk here? - Um, l want to talk about my brother. But... - Okay. - l don't want- l don't want to do it here. - When do you want to talk about him? Caleb. [laughs lightly] - l didn't want to do this here, but l don't know when l'm gonna see you again. Look, l don't want you fuckin' my brother up. Okay? - Oh, okay. - l know you're a little whore, okay? You don't fool me with your flirty little tops and your fuckin' cliche punk-rock bullshit, okay? l know you slept with half the fuckin' frat guys at that stupid school of yours, and l don't want you destroying my brother. You understand me? He's a sweet kid, and he's a goddamn virgin, and l just know that you're this train wreck that he's not gonna be able to get out of the way of. - How dare you talk to me like that! - l asked around. l asked about you, okay? l asked about you, and l know you're a little whore. Don't try and tell me otherwise, okay? Now l am never gonna see you again. But l swear to God, if you fuck him up, l will dig a hole, and l will put you in it. l will kill you, and l will put you in the fuckin' ground. l don't care that you're a girl. l don't give a shit, okay? You understand what l'm saying to you? You understand me? You better nod your head or do some fuckin' thing so l know that you hear what l'm telling you. - [crying] - [crying] [engine starts] [turns off engine] - Hey. - Stop. - Hey. - Stop, no, don't- don't come near me! l'll scream, l'll scream! - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't scream. Don't scream. l just wanted to say l'm sorry, okay? So l'm sorry. - Why the fuck would you say those things? Are you crazy? - No, no, l swear l'm not crazy. [crying] l'm not-l'm not crazy. l'm sorry l'm crying. l'm fuckin' crying. l don't- l'm sorry, okay? Just please don't say anything to Peter, okay, or Donald. Please don't say anything to Donald, okay? l'm-l'm- - Don't fuck with me! Fuck. Oh, shit. - God. - Oh, shit. - [crying] Look, l'm a little fucked up right now, okay? Just please don't tell my brother, and please don't tell Donald about this. Don't tell anybody about this! - l won't, l won't! Just shut up. You're making a scene. - Okay. Okay. l'm done. l'm done. [whispers] l'm sorry. [truck door opens, slams] - This is all really delicious, Emma. Where did you learn to cook like this? - My mother, mostly. Before she, uh, started drinking every afternoon and evening, she was a pretty good cook. - A drunk, huh? ls she single? What? l'm making conversation. - No, my-my mom and dad are still together. They have an arrangement. - Caleb? - Whoa! [thud] What the fuck are you doing out here? - What am I doing out here? - l'm-l'm-l'm leaving now. - No, no, wait. l think you owe me an explanation. - Okay, l think you're underestimating how awkward this is for me. - You want to tell me why you called me a whore at the grocery store? - You don't want to know why l'm out in front of Donald's house in the middle of the night with a camera? - Not really. - Uh, do you have another cigarette? Thanks. - So? - Right. Peter told me that you- you cheated on your boyfriend to be with him, and- well, hearing that, l- you know, l was cheated on very recently, and, uh, l don't want you to hurt Peter. Also, l haven't slept in over a week, so there's that. Literally over a week. So l'm-l'm kind of, you know, l find myself in, uh, sort of in a- in a daze between being asleep and awake, and l find myself doing, you know, strange things. A small example of that, the other day, l actually introduced myself to a tree. So, um, it's not a joke. You know, suddenly l'm in the middle of doing something. l'm talking to somebody or l'm driving or thinking about how small they could make a T-shirt. l'm sorry. - l'm not a whore. - Okay. - Are you growing a beard? - No. Just haven't shaved in quite a while. l should probably get going, so... - Yeah. - l think l landed on a sprinkler. - Okay. Okay, time-out. Just a little break. - [laughs] - The old man needs a breather. - Donald? - Yes, my dear? - Peter hasn't really told me anything about his mother, and if you wouldn't mind, would you be good enough to share with me a little bit while we're walking here? - Okay. What would you like to know? - Anything, l guess. He told me that she died when he was 12, and that's all l really know. - l don't know how much Peter really remembers. He was probably ten the last time he saw her. - Oh. l didn't know that. - Yeah. - Donald? - Yeah? - lf it's okay, l'd like to hear a little bit more. - ls there a reason you haven't asked Peter this? - No, l have. - l don't know if it's- Okay. All right, it's not a happy tale, l'm afraid. Diane- that's Caleb and Peter's mother- [sighs] She was having an affair with another man. l found out about it, and l asked her to leave the house. l was pretty devastated, as you can imagine. When l told the boys about it, they- they didn't want to see her, didn't want to talk to her or anything. You know, they felt like me. They felt they were betrayed. And then, about a year later, she- she was diagnosed with cancer. Four months after that, she died. lt was a pretty dark time for all of us. - And Peter never saw her that entire time? - Not just Peter. None of us did. [hammering] - J.T., may l ask you something? - Yeah. - Have you ever thought about hurting someone? - Sure, all the time. Remember that night, drank the pony at Blue Ribbon, l was getting fuckin' hammered. l told you l thought l killed some dude on my walk home? - No. - Yeah, remember when we were working on the place in Norfolk, and we were doing the drywall? l'm pretty sure l told you that day. - No, l totally would have remembered that. That is fucking crazy. - Yeah, maybe l dreamt l told you. But anyway, it turns out l was blacked out at the bar the whole night. Wicked, though, right? - Yeah. - You need me to help you put the drop on somebody? l'd do it for you. You know that. - Nah, thanks, but l've been thinking a lot about hurting Donald, which l suppose if l were a teenager, it would- it would be normal or healthy even, but you know, l'm getting old, boy. You know, l saw my brother's new girlfriend last night, and it occurred to me that l'm becoming that fucking cocksucker. - Your dad wants to fuck your brother's girlfriend too? - No. Well, l don't know. Maybe. - Thanks for coming over last night, asshole. My niece had to fuck one of my cousins. Real awkward. - Sorry. Oh, hey, uh, Rock, l did get some sleep last night, though. - Wow. - 45 minutes' worth. - Did you hear that? Hey, should we give him a medal? Did you dream of Venus, play with your penis? - Love him. - Hey, Dad, how are we doing over there? We're getting pretty cold. - Keep your shorts on there, pencil dick, 'cause the masterpiece is almost done. - Masterpiece. He's burning the shit out of whatever he's cooking. - Voila. - Nicely done. - Come on, you just gotta, you know, scrape off the- - The scorched black cocoon you've created around the chicken breast? - Emma, l assure you, it'll be delicious. - Oh, no, it's great. Thank you so much, Donald. - You're welcome, my dear. [bird caws] - What was that? - One of those damn raccoons. - What the hell is he doing? l'm sorry. - Your dad has a shotgun. - Jesus, Dad, what are you doing? [gunfire] Dad! Dad, have you fucking lost it? - Don't shoot! Stop! Don't shoot! Stop! - Dad, it's Caleb! - Stop! lt's me! - Put the gun down! - Stop shooting the fuckin' gun! - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, l'm fine. - Why were you in the trees just now? What happened to your lip? - [panting] Hey, Donald. - Were you hit? - No, no, l'm fine. l think you caught a little bit of the Lang's chicken coop, though. Actually, that's a pretty good range on the, uh, what is that, your .870? Yeah, not bad. - Yeah, pretty good. Are you losing your hair? - No. l don't know. Well, maybe a little. - Yeah, well, you couldn't blame me for that. You know, you get that from the mother's side. - Okay. - Wait, Caleb. Why were you in the trees just now? - Oh, uh, just, uh... l was just taking some pictures. - Trespass on my property again, l will shoot you. - Better work on your aim then. - l think you really, really freaked Dad out. Like, you guys go eight years without speaking to one another, and then you just appear, literally, out of a puff of smoke in the backyard. l mean, dad could have killed you. Maybe the single most bizarre thing l've ever seen. l'm going to the restroom. Don't eat my fries. - l won't. - What are you doing? - What do you mean? - l know you're taking pictures of me, Caleb. - Okay, l know what you're thinking, and you're wrong. l don't have feelings for you. l don't even like you that much, if you want to know the truth. - l don't understand this. You're-you're semi-normal one second, and the next second, you're a complete lunatic. l barely even know you, Caleb. - What do you think about me now that l said that l don't like you? - l don't know. l don't know. You-just stop, okay? - Okay. - Please, just stop it. - Okay. - lt's just weird. - l know it's weird. - l don't want to have to discuss this with Peter. - Oh, well, you're not gonna do that. - l will if l have to. - No, you won't. - What-what do you- what do you want from this? - Just don't break his heart. That's all. You're so beautiful. Don't break his heart, please. - l think that you need help. Stop it! Stop! [gasps] - l started sleeping again since we started, uh, conversing. l've been able to sleep. l can't explain it. - Oh, shit. - Are you gonna be needing a cigarette tonight? Yes or no? Yes or no? Oh, my God, these are good. Mm! - Hi. - Hi. - Why are you guys so quiet? - Hmm? - Were you talking about me when l was gone? - No. - Huh? - [scoffs] - Oh, hey, are you guys gonna need a ride back to school on Sunday? l probably don't have to work, so- - Are you seriously offering to give us a ride right now? - Yeah, sure. - Well, you kind of acted like l needed to give you my firstborn to pick us up in the first place. - l know. l must have been in one of my moods, you know. - [laughs] - Uh, well, the trains are running again, so you know- but thanks anyway. Hey, what did you say happened to your lip? - Oh, you don't want to know. Excuse me. Peter? Can l talk to you for a sec? - Uh, yeah. l'll just-l'll see you inside, okay? - Okay. - l just wanted to, uh, talk to you about something. - Yeah? Well, what is it? - Emma. - [laughs] Are you serious? Like, you should be fuckin', like, dead right now, like, with buckshot in your chest, and-and-and this is still what's on your mind? - Yeah, well, this is important to me, man. And l just think, you know... - [laughs] - l think you need to be careful with her. l'm serious. l catch her looking at me, and l don't know. l just, you know, l just wanted you to be aware of it, that's all. - l think that's in your head, Caleb. And l think l would have noticed something like that, you know? - Hey, you know what? l hope it is. l really do. - You haven't noticed at all the way we look at each other? - What do you mean? - l mean, l think we're in love. - [laughs] Oh, sorry, but- [laughing] What? You're-you're not serious, are you? - Yes, l'm fucking serious. - [laughs] - Why would l make that up? - Oh, that's hilarious. - She wants to- - She wants to? - l'm-l'm a virgin, okay? - l know. - Yeah, well, she wants to take my virginity. So we're gonna- anyway, it- l'm in love with this girl. - Are you sure about that? - Yeah. l'm sure. l'm sure about how l feel, anyways. - Well, have you told her? l mean, have you-have you told her how you feel? - No. But l want to. And l think this is- l think l might do it on this trip. l think this-spending time like this together, it's-it's good for us, you know? What the hell's the matter with you? You look like you're gonna be sick. - Oh, no, no, no. l'm just- l'm just really tired right now. l'm-l'm really happy for you, Peter. l guess l was wrong about her being a whore. That's terrific news. - Uh-huh. Thanks, Caleb. - Sure. Uh, hey, Peter? You know l love you, though, right? Like, l've got your back, or whatever they're saying. - [laughs] - l'm serious. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - l'm serious, you know. - Thanks, Caleb. - You know, um- Never mind. l'll talk to you later. [engine revs] - Yeah, sure. [no audio] [sweet choral singing] - Your dad told me that you never saw your mother in the hospital when she got sick. l told you all about my parents: their drinking, my panic attacks. You don't have anything on me. - What my dad said is true. Except that Caleb did see my mother before she died. He was the only one to see her, and he and my father haven't spoken since then. - Have you ever been in love with the idea of someone? - ldea? l don't know what you mean. - Okay. Say there's- there's someone in your life, and you know you can't be in love with them. You don't really know them. Maybe you know that you're-you're- you're not really right for them. No, you know that whatever it is you're feeling is really just an attraction towards an image of that person you've created in your mind? - l don't know. - No, of course. l'm sorry. You were probably molested as a child. Were you molested as a child? - What? - Molested, you know. - You have no right to ask me that. - Oh, right. l fuck you in the ass for 50 bucks, but you get bent out of shape when l inquire about your past. That makes a lot of sense. You know what? Fuck this. l'm out of here. Sorry l said that. That was really, really rude, okay? Also, l-l didn't tip you very well this time. Have a good weekend. [bittersweet guitar and singing] [wind whistling] [wind chime tinkling] [wind chime quickens] [gasps] [door rattles] - Oh, shit. - Emma. Hi. Hey, um, don't- don't be frightened, please. l'm-uh, l just wanted to try and apologize to you for kissing you earlier. l realize now how inappropriate that might have been and- Ugh! l don't know what l was thinking. So you know, l won't be coming around here anymore, l can promise you that, okay? Whew! God, this has just gotten silly, hasn't it? l mean, look at me. l sleep in my freezing car all night, just with the hope that l'd be able to see you... To apologize to you. Anyway, l've been acting childish, and-and-and-and that's all l wanted to say. All right? Really, that- that's it. l'm, uh, l'm- l'm done. Do you think you- you might attempt to accept my weird apology? - Sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Great. Okay. l feel better. So l guess it's- [British accent] Good eve, m'lady. All right. - Caleb. - Yeah? - l'm locked out. Do you know of another way in the house? - Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. l, um- there's an old trick. l'm sure l could still do it. lt's around the corner here. lt's right down these steps over here. Well, you're not exactly in perfect garb for this. How-how about l go in first, and l'll just- l'll pull you in? - Okay. - Yeah. [crashing noises] - [whispering] l don't ever want to see you again. Do you understand me? Ever. - [whispers] Okay. - [gasping] [hammering sounds] [train whistle blows] - All right. What the fuck is this? - l think l may have to quit, Rocky. l'm not a good person. - Well, l know that, but don't you think we could choose something a little less dramatic than this to get the point across? - l'm gonna take the rest of the day off. - Jesus, you're a piece of work. - lf you have to fire me, well, that's okay. [bluesy song] - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You all right, Caleb? l've never seen you throw a hammer like that. Have you fucked your brother's girlfriend yet? - No. But l want to very, very badly. Very badly. - Then what are you so bent out of shape about? l want to fuck tons of chicks. - Fuckin' assholes. - You want to fuck tons of... - Fuck you! - You know you want it. - Oh, yeah, she wants it. She does. - J.T., excuse me a minute. [bluesy song ends] Let's see here. [upbeat guitar music] - Yeah. That's what l wanted. - Oh, hey, bros. Hey, listen, l have a quick question. Do you guys like listening to shitty music while you're butt-fucking or after? - Get him, you fuckers! [umping rock music] - [groans] Well, she's leaving tomorrow. l'll probably never see her again, so thank fuckin' Christ. [sighs] l just wish l could get over this strange compulsion to protect Peter, you know? Because- and the only way l know how to do that is to- to hurt him. - When l was a kid, my pa used to beat me up pretty good if l messed something up. He made me cry a lot, but it made me tough, you know? - Mmm, no, no, no. Up a little bit. No, over a little. - [gasping] Ooh, shit. Fuck. [breathing heavily] l'm sorry. [exhales] l'm sorry. - No, it's okay. lt's okay. - Almost, right? - Yeah. - Fuck. [emotive guitar music] - Ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah Ah Sleep don't visit So l choke on Sun And the days blur into one Bags under my eyes All the things l've felt and done Sheets are swaying From the old clothesline Like a row of captured ghosts - [sniffling] - Welcome home Ah, ah, ah Ah, come home - Your face. - l know. [whispering] Go up to my old room, take off all your clothes. Now. - All my nightmares escape my head Bar the door, please Don't let them in You were never supposed to leave Now my head's splitting at the seams And l don't know lf l can breathe Ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ah, ah, ah Ah, ah, ah [music fades] - [gasps] [dull thud] [glass rattles] - Ah! - [whispering] Shh! Shut the fuck up. - [gasps, moans] - Shh! - [gasps, moans] [panting] - l haven't seen these photos in eight years. - You didn't keep any with you? - No, l did. l just- l moved out in a hurry, so... - Why were you the only person to see your mom in the hospital? Your dad, Donald, he told me, and Peter told me a little bit, and... - [exhales] l was really close with my mom, but l couldn't bring myself to speak to her. l wouldn't answer her calls. l-l just-l shut her out of my life completely. She got sick not long after that, and when she went into the hospital, l started really pushing Donald for information, and it all just hit me. He's totally full of shit. So l just went straight to my mom in the hospital, and she told me that Donald had been fuckin' around on her for years, and it finally got bad enough that she just packed up and left. She didn't think Donald would be vindictive enough to take her fucking boys away from her, you know? - Why didn't you tell Peter? - Well, he- he was 12 years old, so l... You know... lf l didn't know any better, l would have thought that- l don't know. l would have thought that, uh, it was your first time or something. l don't know. lt was... [both laugh] l got a- l don't know. - [laughs lightly] - No, no, no, you- - [crying] - Right? - l'm sorry. - You-you're not- you-you-you-you- okay. Oh, l gotta go. - Hey, wait, wait, wait. Where are you going? Caleb. [laughs] - Peter's in love with you, okay? lt's my brother. l'm sorry. [sighs] Fuckin' shit. [sighs] [sighs] - Pretty sure l told you l'd shoot you if l saw you on my property again. Yeah, l guess you didn't take that seriously. - Not really. - Did you just fuck your brother's girlfriend? Of course you did, you piece of shit. Well, are you gonna tell him, or should l? - Oh, no, you're not gonna tell him a goddamn thing, Donald. - Of course l am. Jesus, he's my son. - So? l'm your son. l'm your son, Donald! l'm your son! You left me, you remember? You left me, 'cause l fuckin' found you out. Why don't you tell me something? Why don't you tell me how much of a fucking coward you have to be to erase your son? - Oh, hey, hold on a second. Come on, l tried to reach out. l found out where your place is, and l tried to come over a couple of times. - l've lived less than two miles away from you for more than eight years, Dad. You were my fuckin' hero. - No. No. - [sighs] - Peter. - Hi. - Hi. - Who'd you think it was gonna be? [laughs lightly] - l thought-l thought it was gonna be you. Sorry. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - You're not gonna tell him, not ever, 'cause if you do, l'll tell him your secrets, and he won't ever speak to you again. l know you don't want to die lonely, Dad. [door closes] - [sniffles] - You look kind of sweaty. - [laughs] l was having a bad dream. What? - Oh. - Did-did you want to sleep in here? - Yeah. l was just- l was just thinking, do you think we could try again? [train whistle blows] Well, thanks, Dad. [car trunk slams shut] lt was an experience, as usual. - My pleasure. You two are sweet as sugar together. - Thank you very much, Donald, for having me. - Okay. - Well. - Well. - All right. - All right. - Peter, could you- hang back just for a second, will you? - l'll meet you inside. - Okay. - l don't know where to start. l haven't been a perfect father. l want you to know that l know that. l've made mistakes, some of which were unavoidable. You know, l can't really be held responsible for those, but... What l'm trying to say... You know, you're old enough now to know that sometimes people do things that- that they know are wrong, but they- they just do 'em anyway, 'cause- 'cause to do the right thing might be too painful. And also... l love you. And l don't say that enough. We don't say that enough. l mean, l'm not- l'm not- l'm not blaming you, necessarily. Just, you could, you know, you could say it more if- l'm just saying, you know? Okay. [sniffles] All right, get out of here. [quiet acoustic guitar music] [train whistle blows] - All of my dreams They all roll on by - l love you. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l shouldn't have said anything. - No, no, no, no, don't be sorry. - What? - And hidden past the business sense [doorbell rings] As water lilies over streams Rivers browse coffee beans Pistol visions in my hands l want to see my blood across the sand Morning always looked like you Morning always looked like you And from my window the only view - You want to come in? - Yeah, sure. - As you walk away not lookin' Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh All of my dreams My life spent awake ln the dark of my veins Oh, nothing can stay l continue through a backlit world Where the willows bend like long black curls Down your face from life Through the kinks in your spine From the last thing we spoke To the very first line Love is something that we couldn't help but do That something turned to someone else Somebody new l just love to love And you love to cry l meant it through each second That we said good-bye And l came up past a station Where the floors are all blue And somethin' 'bout the way it looked Reminded me of you lt might have been how far l've come So l dropped a match until the floor was gone All of my trains l let them all go All of my trains l let them all go All of my trains l let them all go All of my trains Then l lit the thread across the station door Kentucky straight, l hit the floor The station tousled up in flames But l could only read the bottle's name And l weaned its breast and turned it dry Like the wake of summer from July And got up and tripped over my knees Which caved in at the slightest breeze Morning always looked like you Morning always looked like you All of my trains l let them all go All of my trains l let 'em all go
