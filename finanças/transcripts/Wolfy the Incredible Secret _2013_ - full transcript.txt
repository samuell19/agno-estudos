(CAWING) (SNORING) (ALL LAUGHING) (SPLUTTERING AND COUGHING) (FEMALE HUMMING) (COUGHING) Wolfy! Wolfy? (HUMMING CONTINUES) Hey, Wolfy! Oh! (CAWING) (PANTING) Oh, oh. Hey. Hey, be careful. What's this trailer? It's the bird. What bird? I don't like this place at all. Come on. -(CROW CAWING) -Oh. Aw. Now then, now then, now then, now then, now then, now then, now then, now then. Let me try to guess. You? You're Tom. Uh, yes. Have we met? So, you, you're Wolfy. Wolfy. If Your Highness would care to step in through here. (CAUTIONING) Tut-tut-tut! Excuse me, ma'am, my mother always told me not to follow strangers. We rabbits are prudent, not fearful. We're not going to follow strangers, so please... (SPEAKING RAPIDLY) But you, you're not a rabbit, right? Oh, no. I'm a wolf actually. Then come up here! Caw! Uh, we rabbits are... Oh. What am I doing here? Hmm. Bizarre. -(SNORTING) -Whoa. Whoa! (SCREAMING) Whoa! (TOM SCREAMING) Put me down! Now then, my little prince, have you already had a chance to see your future before meeting me? Uh, no. I don't think so. Well, there's a first time for everything. (CRACKLING) Caw! You must try to empty your mind. (TOM WHIMPERING) Caw! Try to concentrate on the crystal ball. Listen closely to Cornelia's voice! Repeat after me. I am here and I am your crystal ball. I am your crystal ball and you look right at me. You're completely crazy when I look at you. You're completely crazy when I look at you. (LAUGHS) Caw! Show me some respect, you rascal. There. Now, look. It's working. I see a big forest. Very far from here. So, do you see it? Uh, no. Look more closely. Caw! Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! I see it. Oh, wait. Uh, it looks like Tom. And there, right next to him, who do you think that is? Uh, it's me! Oh, yes. And where do you think they're heading off to in that beautiful red car, that Wolfy and Tom? Uh, I don't know. Fishing? Caw! Tell me have you seen these alleyways before? And what about this fair lady at her window? -(HUMMING) -She's singing a song. Doesn't it remind you of anything? WOLFY: Oh, yeah, yeah. Long ago, so long ago. That fair lady singing is called Olympe de Wolfenberg. Don't you know that name? Who exactly can this Olympe be then? LEA: She's pretty. I mean, for a she-wolf. Cornelia, right? WOLFY: No, no. Cornelia was the... The one with the crazy ball. Just think, she's my mother. Olympe de Wolfenberg. You have a mother and you didn't even know. Guess not. Anyway, I love her dress. -Huh, Manon? -(GROANING) Let's see. Oh, yeah! Not bad. -Looks very classic. -Oh, careful! It hurts. My back's not a saddle, okay? Oh. That'll teach you not to play ball with wild boar. Huh, playing ball? -That's funny. I was the ball. -Wolfenberg, Wolfenberg, Wolfenberg, Wolfenberg. Hmm. (GASPS) Wolfenberg! "This long-reigning family lives in the Skedaddle Mountains, "a citadel surrounded by deep forests, "home for many centuries to... "...a terrible dynasty of wolves!" Ooh! Sounds like that horrible film to me. What's it called again? -Dracula Rabbit! -Huh? -Oh. Oh. -(LAUGHS) Horrible! -Dreadful! Oh. -We love it! The perfect place for a vacation. Oh, definitely. Who'd wanna go there for anything? We do. Tom, get ready. We're going. -What! Where to, huh? -(GASPS) Come on, get ready. We're going to Wolfenberg to see my mom. I saw her in the ball. Enough of that ball. We're not going to follow a crystal ball to a country run by a line of wolves! This is outrageous. Well, that's how it's going to be. I saw it. It was in the future. I saw you and me, in a car. (LAUGHS) Yeah, a car. That's totally impossible since there aren't any cars here. -There's one! -BOTH: Huh? And I know where. Uncle Vatanen once told us -that he won the Lapland Rabbit Rally in 1973! -Come on, guys. The fastest rabbit in the world. -Here. -Huh? BOTH: Oh. BOTH: I'll drive! BOTH: No, I will! TOM: Whoo! (CAWS) It's creepy around here. Are you sure about this? (LAUGHS) Well, if you prefer, I'll just drop you off here. -(HOOTING) -(GASPS) No, no, that's fine. (MIMICS HOOTING) (BOTH GASP) Hmm. So that must be the dear boy. Doesn't look like much to worry about. Scarlett, a moment, if you please. My time is yours, my dear prince. Go entertain our young guest, if you would. Your every wish is my command, Your Highness. Hmm. I don't have time to waste on him now. -(YAWNS) -Hey, what are you doing? Why are we stopping? -I need to sleep. -(MUSIC PLAYING) -Here? -It's a hotel, right? Is it really? It says so there. TOM: Oh, yeah. What can I do for you? Uh, we'd like to sleep and to try to get some... -We're full. Sorry. -Huh? Are you telling us there's no room in this humongous building at all? Yes, that's right. Wow. How about that? And to be honest, sir, I'm afraid, right now it's simply not possible. WOLFY: Oh, no? And why's that? Apparently, this place is too classy for us. That's what he means by that. No. Actually, uh, the hotel's policy doesn't accept guests who are... ...in the nude, sir. That's all. Don't stand there. It's completely embarrassing. (CLEARS THROAT) Now, go on, get clothes, get clothes. At least a jacket or something. Follow the example of your Nofang right here. Who's got no fangs? Me, no fangs? Nofangs who, between you and me, aren't allowed inside the rooms. -And that would have been... -(GASPS) ...the second hotel policy to be broken. Take this. Say I sent you. Very good for young people, I hear. -And, they do accept animal companions. -(SCOFFS) Ah, thank you. -TOM: Come on, let's go. I can't believe it. -Huh? He said I was a pet! That penguin was a jerk. Heron. I think he was more of a heron. -Penguins are smaller and... -Petite. -A bit like you. -I'm not that petite. -TOM: Well, maybe a little, but... -WOLFY: Right. TOM: Yeah. Well, whatever. Is the inn any farther from here? No, no, it's right over here. Look there. Yeah. (BELL CLANGING) Yes? Uh, um, hello, ma'am. We're looking for a bed and a place to... Or rather two beds? Well, come on in quickly. It's cold and I'm barely dressed. (GIGGLES) But I see I'm not alone. You have no clothes on. Oh, yeah, naked. I know. Hang on a sec. I'll grab something. (GIGGLES) (GASPS) -(GROANS) -Here, put this on. -It'll be more appropriate. -A dress? A dressing gown. It used to belong to my late husband, Mr. Galantine. Is that... Is that your husband? It was, yeah, yeah. He loved rabbits a lot! (LAUGHS) Yeah, it seems that wild boars really like Tom. Isn't that right, buddy? We don't need to discuss that. His job was to deal with all the rabbits, especially for the prince! Ah! Ah. When you say that his job was to deal with rabbits you mean... He pampered them and he fed them lots of food. Afterward, they were all nice and fat. Oh, great. There! You look better dressed now. -(GROANS) -Don't you? Ma'am, here. Do you know this person? It's my mother. No. She looks like a princess from around here before my time. But, now, I think it's time for a little snack. (SIGHS) TOM: Mmm. Not bad at all. It's good. WIDOW GALANTINE: Here, have some more hotpot, Mr. Tom. My dear Vladu used to always say, "A well-fed rabbit is a happy rabbit." (GIGGLES) -TOM: That's great. -(SNARLS) -WIDOW GALANTINE: Some more for Mr. Tom. -TOM: Just a bit. They're staying in here, miss. What are His Highness's orders? Your Highness's orders are to do nothing at all, Chief. Your orders are to do nothing at all. Here, there's one last little piece of Prinz-torte, Mr. Tomey, okay? No, no more, thanks. I think I'll burst. -(YAWNS) -Thank you very much, Mrs. Galantine. Just call me Rosetta, eh? So then, are you here for the town's Carne Festival? Uh, so what is that Carne Festival? You really don't know? Every year in this season, Longfangs come from all over the world -to meet in Wolfenberg. -(WOLFY SNORING) Huh? Longfangs? -Longfangs! Carne Festival! -(GASPING) They're all carnivores! The Longfangs pit themselves against our wolves during the Grand Hunt! (WHIMPERS) The Grand Hunt? It really is a lot of fun for all the hunters. Hunting, eating, hunting! Magnificent! That's fantastic, I imagine. -Wolfy! -Huh? Well, I'm going to hide now. I mean, to bed. Yeah, the bed. Hmm? Yeah. I've had enough more than enough food. Yep. A fat rabbit is a cooked rabbit. That's good! You both should get some rest. I have to make my sauerkraut. (GIGGLES) (WOLFY YAWNS) -(TOM GROANING) -(WOLFY SNORING) TOM: Longfangs. Carnage of Nofangs. What are we doing here? Tomorrow, I'm sauerkraut! Mercy, mercy! (SIGHS) Where are you, old Rabbit Land? (GROANS) (WOOD CREAKING) (STUTTERING) Bathroom. Whoa! Oh, pardon. So sorry. Okay. (SHOWER RUNNING) (WIDOW GALANTINE HUMMING) Huh? Wow! Amazing. Truly. -(CURTAINS SWISHING) -(YELPS) It's time to wake up! It's breakfast time! TOM: It's morning? You may call it breakfast, but I call it a buffet. -So dig in, you two. -(BOTH YAWNING) First thing to do is to find you some clothes. Even I can see that your jacket is a bit short, Mr. Tom. Even for a young man. Yes, yes! (GIGGLES) (GROANS) -(HUMMING) -(SQUEAKING) (TEASING) -Ooh! -(DOORBELL TINKLES) -Good morning, Mr. Finkel! -Ah! -Welcome, my fair Rosetta! -(GIGGLES) Always at work, huh? SIMON-EDGAR: I was just thinking to myself I hadn't seen my very charming neighbor in a long time. (BOTH LAUGHING) Aren't you a little flatterer! -I've brought these two young people... -Hmm? ...whose choice of wardrobe needs more than a little attention, see? Hmm. Now, let me see. Oh. Everything needs doing. -It's very urgent, I suppose? -Hey! It's for the festival, am I right? Yes, and you can clearly see they're pretty much naked. It's just not decent. As you know, Simon-Edgar Finkel knows how to make the best clothes. -Am I correct, Mrs. Rosetta, huh? -(GIGGLES) Such nimble fingers, Simon-Edgar. That's why you've been the court supplier since 1988. Hmm. Your wolf's tail, do you wear it on the left or right side? Ooh! Well, aren't they so handsome! Delightful! And you're both pleased with it, yeah? They're also going to need hunting outfits. These are for town wear. Uh, maybe we'll purchase those later. We're looking for this lady. She's my mother. -(GASPS) -My mother. Don't know her. You'll have to excuse me, good sir. I have lots, uh, lots... Lots and lots of work to do. My humble hedgehog respects, ma'am. Oi! -There's going to be some work for you, my little squirrel. -(SQUEAKING) (SCOFFS) He seemed a bit scared of my mom. TOM: So, what do you think of this yellow shirt? WOLFY: It's yellow. (SQUEAKING) (TEASING) (GRUNTING) (BLOWS) (BELL TOLLING) TOM: Oh, the town is empty. Whoa. Where has everyone gone to, huh? I don't know. They must be somewhere. I don't like this place, Wolfy. Longfangs, Nofangs, I don't like it one bit. Really? I kind of like it. It's funny, I feel... How do you say it? Like I'm right at home. (LAUGHS) -Mmm. -Come on, big ears, I'll get you a hot cocoa. (LAUGHS) (SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) SCARLETT: ♪ Sweet nectar Well, look at that. They're all here. ♪ A wave of thunder for you It's nice, isn't it? -CUSTOMER 1: What is he doing here? -CUSTOMER 2: Waiter! SCARLETT: ♪ When I'm with you WOMAN: He looks tasty. Bloody Marys for 13! There you go. ♪ You got to be all for me ♪ I can keep lying here with you ♪ Till I know your love is true ♪ I'll stay with you ♪ If you hold me nice and long (GASPING) ♪ There's nothing else ♪ For me but you ♪ And if you want me ♪ I'm here for you today ♪ Just say it... Excuse me, two hot chocolates, please. Oh, Scarlett. I truly love redheads. I don't know about you fellas, but I personally always liked hunting foxes myself. Especially when the fox is a chick. ♪ I've made up my mind ♪ For you ♪ I can keep ♪ Keep holding back ♪ When I'm with you Hey! You! Stop that already! -Oh. -(GASPS) What is that? Uh, Wolfy? You put down my friend right now! You hear me? This soft toy yours? Is it his toy or his snack? (ALL JEERING) I'm a wolf as well, you know. Oh, yeah? Where are you from, punk? My name is Wolfy. Gently put my friend down right now! Oh. (MUSIC STOPS) (CROWD CHEERING) Hey! A present for you, Miss Scarlett! Hey! Why'd you do that? Because I wanted to! And what if I don't want you to? As Lieutenant of the Prince's Guard, I have all the rights, -all the privileges to... -Okay, gentlemen! Let's calm right down, please. None of that here. You know the rules, Paul-Loup. Rules are only for dogs. -You know that better than anyone. -(SCOFFS) We wolves are special, honey. CUSTOMER 3: Oh, yes. In any case, Nofangs aren't allowed in this cafe. But you couldn't know. You're not from here. Hey, can you put me down, ma'am? I can walk. SCARLETT: Come on, let's go. Oh! Put me down! Welcome to Wolfenberg, my friends. Just like everywhere else, avoid uniforms. As for Lieutenant Paul-Loup, specifically, be careful of him. He's a cousin of the Prince. Wait a second, you know that schmuck? Everybody knows everybody else in this lovely, dirty little town. That's good. Since everyone knows everyone else, maybe you know her. She's my mom. She's pretty. What are you doing tonight? Do you think we can trust her? We know nothing about this chick. -Shh! -You know what I mean? She's not a chick, okay? And you'll wake up old Ma Pig. -She'll wanna feed us again. -(LAUGHS) It's strange to think that you come from this really weird dump. Oh, come on. What's so strange about it? Aren't you a little strange? Do you think maybe she stood us up? No, no, no. I can tell she's not like that. -Psst! Hey, losers! -(GASPS) What's she doing up there? I don't know. Let's go. Is there no door? (TOM WHIMPERS) SCARLETT: I've been waiting for ages. Where were you? Oh! We had to wait for Ma Pig to go to sleep. (GROANS) Holy cow, she's talkative! Shh, silence. We've got one hour before the guard comes round. It looks bad, but it's easy. Are we gonna do something illegal? (GLASS SHATTERS) -SCARLETT: Tom, pay attention! -(TOM SIGHS) SCARLETT: Look around. Right now, you're in the Gallery of Pedigrees. Anyone who's anyone in Wolfenberg has his portrait in here. This one here was known as Wolfsbane. -(TOM GASPS) -The fearful founder of the dynasty. I don't like this, I don't like this, I don't like this. Is little Tom nervous? No at all! But why are we breaking in? We could've come inside by day with a guide instead, right? (SIGHS) I am the guide. A private visit's much more fun. -Ah! -Shh. -Yeah, of course it is. -Oh, shh. (MOCKING) No, no, no. This is Romus the First. The inventor of the Carne Festival. What a great legacy he has. And who's the white wolf? Right there. He is Prince Lou-Andrea, the current sovereign. Young and handsome. Or, at least, he is in the picture. TOM: There's nothing here but wolves! WOLFY: We're looking for my mom who's a wolf. -She must be here. -(SCARLETT GASPS) SCARLETT: That's strange! WOLFY: What? SCARLETT: A portrait's missing. Look, you can tell it's not there. -Yeah. So what? -Mmm-hmm. You must trust unpredictable Scarlett. (TOM GRUNTING) Oh, Tom, come on. Are you really trying to get us caught? There's nothing I can do about... ...About sneezing. Oh, it's 'cause of the dust. (SNEEZES) Oh! Ah. Ah, that's good. How do you do that? -The ancient art of tickling. -(MOANING) -It can't be taught. -More, please. Hey, are we gonna go in deeper into this place? -Exactly. -Ah. Come on. Let's get going, Tom. (SIGHS) Hmm. (GASPING) -(CLANKING) -Oh. (GRUNTS) (GASPS) Ugh! (GASPS) (BOTH GROAN) Hey, look there, it's her! (GRUNTS) Yeah, that's her. It's my mom. TOM: No doubt about it. It's... Wolf! Berg! Police! Hands up! Nobody move! Scarlett, run! Take these two tourists away. (LAUGHS) Welcome to Loupianka State Prison. -Last stop! -(GROANING) -(GRUNTS) -(GASPING) -Are you okay? -(GROANS) Oh. Yeah, great. Oh. What a nightmare! After the horror museum, prison! Oh. Thanks, Ms. Scarlett! Oh. Stop complaining, okay? All thanks to her, I know my mom's out there. Yeah, in a painting. Great. You're never happy. There's no point talking to you. Let's just get some sleep, huh? Tomorrow's another day, you know. -Oh! It hurt! -(GASPS) -What the heck is in the straw? -Huh? MALE: You won't get anything out of me. I have nothing to declare. Wait a minute. Isn't that big ball of needles our tailor from town? -Why's he here? -I have nothing to declare. Simon-Edgar Finkel. -It's us, Wolfy and Tom. -You won't get anything out of me. Ouch! Hey, mister? Whoo-hoo! You can come out. You have nothing to fear. -We're in prison. -I have nothing to declare. -You won't get anything out of me. -(SIGHS) Well, we can't help him. (EXHALES) So, what do we do? -What we said: we sleep. -I have nothing to declare. -You won't get anything out of me. -Oh! Sleep? Sleep is easier said than done. The hedgehog has to pipe down first. (SIGHS) Just try to think of something pleasant. Okay. Can you give me an example? Mom. -SIMON-EDGAR: I have nothing to declare. -(SNORING) -You won't get anything out of me. -Terrific. Now, it's on both sides. Oh. -One carrot. -SIMON-EDGAR: I have nothing to declare. -You won't get anything out of me. -Two carrots. -Three carrots. -SIMON-EDGAR: I have nothing to declare. You won't get anything out of me. TOM: Four carrots. SIMON-EDGAR: I have nothing to declare. You won't get anything out of me. I have nothing to declare. You won't get anything out of me. (GASPS) (SCREAMS) Silence, pusillanimous creature! Who are you guys? Captain N, liberation commando. Well, if you're here for us, there's no need. -All we're trying to do is just find my mom... -Hey, hey. Longfang, can it, okay? We're only here to grab him. SIMON-EDGAR: I have nothing to declare. You won't get anything out of me. (STAMMERS) With the Hedgehog Syndrome. Once he's in a ball, that...that's it. Looks like we're stuck, Captain. So what now? (SCOFFS) He won't get through like that! We leave from the inside! We have to force our way out. All right! (GRUNTS) (GROANING) You'll need a battering ram. -(BOTH GASP) -(GRUNTS) GUARD: What the heck is... Oh! -Come on! -All of you, stop right... (GROANS) -Oh, get back! Get back! -(LAUGHS) (BLOWING) -All of you, hands up! -Oh! (SCREAMING) (GROANS) Simon-Edgar! -Get up, Simon! -(GRUNTING) Oh! Oh. -He's out of commission. -(EXHALES) We'll have to carry him to the forest. Oh no, no, we have no reason to go there! Psst, hey! Don't tell us what to do, you stupid Carne! Carne? Why are you calling me Carne? Carne Festival. Well, you're here for the Carne Festival, aren't you? No, I already told you why I'm here. Just listen... You don't wanna come? Well, that's fine. But we're going! Come on, hurry up, let's move. Wait, wait, that, that's... That, that, the, the... Wait. Wait... Argh! Uh, uh. Where do we go now? Hope I never get to see you again! (ECHOING) You've been a complete jerk! (WHISTLING) Uh! This way! First time at the Carne Festival? Oh, the Prince's receptions are always a success. -Aren't you hungry? -Would you two care for some? Oh! (GRUNTING) -GUEST 1: Lunch! -GUEST 2: What is that all about? GUEST 3: What is that? (GROWLING AND SNARLING) -Ah, Wolfy! -Oh! WOLFY: Run! -(GLASS SHATTERS) -Ah, ow! Well, well, well, well... Who's this I see? It seems that it's that little punk from the cafe! -Oh, no. Not him! -Well, then. Chief Le Fur! Yes, Sir. Can't you keep hold of your prisoners? Um, well, of course. Mmm... Lock 'em up now, you pack of morons! -Ooh! -Ah, Scarlett. Look who's arrived after all! -(GIGGLES) -My little big Wolfy! Let him pass, all right? -Oh, Scarlett! -(TOM LAUGHING) Why is he still around here? Didn't you deal with him already, Scarlett? Oh, because he's so awfully cute! Wolfy! Come, over here... Your Highness, please allow me to introduce my very young old friend, Wolfy! Good day, sir. Mmm. (SIGHS) You may proceed, Winston. Very well, Your Highness. Ladies and gentlemen, and gracious guests of His Most Wolfish Highness of Wolfenberg. Before the start of the Carne Festival, which brought you all from near and far to this kingdom, it's time for our world-famous event for the festival, The Great Prince Romus Steeplechase! (CLEARS THROAT) The competitors are in the paddock! Ah! (CROWD CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) (YELPING) Why am I out here? Huh? What do you want from me? That's Tom over there! He's my friend! WINSTON: And they're off! Oh no! Easy, boys! Good dogs! Be good! WINSTON: The situation has confused the rabbit... Oh! One lap down. -Yahoo! -Tom! Tom! Up and down! Argh! -Tom! Way to go. -Yay! Yahoo! Whoo! (LAUGHING) (GROWLING) WINSTON: What suspense! Will there be a dead heat? Will there be a photo finish? (GASPING) WINSTON: No! Extraordinary! -Yay, Tom! -Yahoo! WINSTON: The rabbit has won! Yay! Did you see how they ended up? I made short work of 'em. Oh, how I adore you, my little hicks! (WOLFY GIGGLES) The rabbit is entertaining. Bring them over to the palace, Scarlett. It's so very boring here. WINSTON: Attention, please! There's no winning ticket for this race. No prize money will be paid. Apologies. A regrettable blunder, Captain N! You make very lousy rebels! I'm really sorry, but how could I have known who that wolf was? To think you had my son in your hands and you let him go? That was very, very stupid! But the harm's been done now. And every cloud has a silver lining! Your finger, Captain? No! Ah! No, no, no. I don't want to do that! It's cruel punishment! You need a little blow to your pride now! And it gives Fiorella such pleasure after all! -Come on. Give me your pinkie! -Humpf! It's all my fault, Your Majesty! I was in such a state. I'm just so ashamed, ashamed. Do you needed to bite my finger, too? No. We shouldn't try to spoil it too much. Let's talk about him instead... Her and her pathetic plants! Fiorella, no, I swear I'm sick of it! So then, did you see him? Tell me about him... My son, what is he like? Well, Your Majesty, I think pink really suits him. (CAWING) There is fresh news from the forest, my prince. Are you interested? Okay, you two, I have to leave for a bit. Winston will look after you. (CHUCKLES) What idiots all of those rebel upstarts are! How can I get rid of that chewing gum-colored runt in pink standing over there? Ugh, the pair of them are thoroughly vulgar! Would the gentlemen care to accompany me to their apartments inside the royal palace? Oh, splendid! Show us around, won't you, Winston! (CHUCKLES) I love giving orders. Feels like I'm the boss. Wow! Look at this! Oh! Now, this is what I call an apartment, am I right? Ha ha ha! Mmm. The gentleman is going to have to leave these apartments, immediately! Why do I have to leave right now? I actually wouldn't mind just a little nap. Uh-oh! Hmm... The gentleman can snooze all that he wants... In the gentleman's own apartment. In my apa...Oh! I have my own apartment here as well? Naturally, sir! It's so silly though! There's enough room for two. Look at that bed. Apologies, sir. But Nofangs are not allowed in this wing of the palace. Apart from those Nofangs who are servants, of course. Really? Etiquette's very strict inside the palace. His most Wolfish Highness tolerates no exceptions! But Tom is my friend. My brother, Winston! Do you understand the word "brother?" I do understand the word "brother" very well, sir. I have 17 of them. However, the fact is I don't make up the rules here, sir! Well then I'll go give His Wolfness a piece of my mind on all this. Hey, Wolfy, wait for me! Don't move from there, Tom. I'll be back in seven seconds. One, two, three... -Four. -Honestly! Five, six, and seven! Whoa! Hey, put me down, Winston! Hey, I can walk, you know, Winston! Let go of me, right now! -Hey! -Forgive me, sir. My duties do not permit me to wait any longer, even for Mr. Wolfy. The palace's smooth running rests on my shoulders here. -It's a heavy load, young sir. -Mmm. -Uh, excuse me. -(BLEATS) Which, which way is the Prince's apartment? (BLEATING) Mmm-hmm. Okay? This lack of respect for rabbits is outrageous! (LAUGHING) Is that what we're having for dessert? No, Sir, for the bears, for now. The bears... That's good as well. Do you realize that you lost me a fortune on that race, you rabbit? I put everything down on Reservoir Dog, and this dwarf rabbit ruined everything for me. Reservoir Dog, of course, Lieutenant. Unbeatable, usually. But surprises are a part of life. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... (GROWLS) -Uh, Winston? -Sir? What are... The Bears? Simple-minded but endearing animals, Sir! Thank you very much. But I've already known what bears are! I mean, what are, "The Bears?" Here we are, Sir. (GROWLING) Heh! Wait you don't expect me to sleep here, do you Winston? (CHUCKLES) No, Sir! Young sir will have to content himself with looking after them. Oh, look at that! They got it everywhere, in here! Momo, here is your new assistant! I see! You've gotten me a two-bit rabbit! They're gonna eat him like the last one you brought me, that supposed grizzly expert. Hey! I've dealt with much bigger grizzlies than you or your friends here! -(LAUGHING) Come on! -Hey, uh! I'll introduce you. That's Big Guy, he's a Czech. Whoa! The Big Bad Wolf! (CLEARS THROAT) Yeah, right, I'm sorry. I actually meant to say that she's His Royal Wolfness's grand mount! (TOM YELPING) With Sir's permission, I shall leave Sir to converse with Momo! We'll meet again, Winston... Oh! We'll meet again. Well if you must, Sir. If you must. Indeed! (GROANING) That feels good! (SOFT MOANS) (GROWLING) (MURMURING) Is that him, again? Uh well, sorry, excuse me, it's about Tom, Your Wolfness. -(LAUGHING) -You say, "Your Most Serene Highness". Or at a pinch, "Your Highness" like good old Winston, but Winston is from England. Yes, that's just it, Winston, Your Most Highness. -He says that he doesn't want to... In my apartments... -Tom? If possible, I'd rather he stayed with me instead of... Is Tom that funny white rabbit? Yes, that's right. Leave us now, Scarlett. We will continue this later. Yes, with pleasure and regret, my prince. A finger of doe's blood? This comes from the last hunt. Drink up, my boy. Uh, thanks but I'm not thirsty. As you wish. I think we should play a game. Uh, well... Yes, yes, a way to get better acquainted. I propose we play "Wolf, where are you?" Well, uh... Wolf, where are you? Do you hear me? Wolf, where are you? Hey, Wolf, where are you hiding in here? Do you hear me? What are you doing? What are you doing? Wolf, where are you? What are you doing? It's scary. -(DOOR OPENING) -(LAUGHING) Oh, this place is creepy. -(GROANING) -(CRASHES) That scared me. -(LAUGHS) -Oh! As I had thought before, instincts zero, courage zero. Who exactly brought you up like this? What a waste of space you are! There's no possible way you could be a Wolfenberg I am! But I am, though! My mom lives in this palace. Mmm, your mother. Does she have a name, this mother of yours? Olympe, Sir! Olympe of, of here, of Wolfenberg! What? Say that again. Olympe of Wolfenberg, Your Highness. Yes, well, yes, I heard you the first time. The Princess Olympe? My own cousin? Oh, my poor little wolf, I'm sorry. I have some very bad news for you to hear, my young pup. What? What is it? What do you have to tell me? Well, unfortunately she's dead. Pardon? Who is? Princess Olympe, my cousin, your mother. She is dead. (HOWLING) Listen, Fiorella, it's him, it's my Wolfy. Do you hear? (HOWLING) Ah! I got the blues, Tommy! I came all the way over here to see how you are doing. I'm blue. Oh yeah, the blues. All the girls get the blues sometimes. I'm listening. Oh, I can't take anymore of this miserable life of luxury I lead. Oh yeah, it sure sounds tough. My beautiful childhood dreams! I betrayed them! I betrayed that little girl who opened her eyes wide in wonder and yelped out, "Go out and live your life!" -I hear you got a car? -A car? Yeah! Well, we have a car, Wolfy and I. A beautiful redhead in a beautiful red car go together. -Oh! Whoa! -Oh, Tommy, let's go. Let's get out of here tonight! The two of us! Save me and save yourself, Tommy. What do you mean, saving me, saving you? And Wolfy? Oh, Wolfy... Yeah Wolfy, we can't leave him here all alone with these crazies! If I were you, I'd forget all about him. He looks to me a bit like he's right at home here. You know what they say? Wolves don't eat their own. Get off your lazy ass now! On your feet! Attention! Oh, leave me alone already. I wanna sleep. Come on, come on, come on! Hey! Get out of my apartment, you jerk! You're the one who's going get out immediately! And on the double! Do you know who you are talking to? Oh yeah? To whom? -I am the Prince Loudovic of Wolfenberg! -(LAUGHING) Yes, that's me! Son of heroic Olympe, who gave her own life to save Wolfenberg... -(LAUGHING) Oh yeah? -She fought all the rebels of the forest! But there were too many sly Nofangs, oh. And that majestic wolf fell to the louts that remained. Well, you better be worthy, huh? I want you in the training yard in two minutes, and no longer or you'll be sorry. Be quick. Up you go. Be a good boy okay? Come on, up! Go! Come on! That's good. Come on! Try to keep your balance. Very good! Good, good! Here you are! Good boy. Oh! One... Two... One... Two... One... Two... I hope you're ready for this, or you're gonna be in big trouble. Try not to get skewered. (LAUGHING) (GROANING) Come on and fight me you coward! En garde! (LAUGHING) Come on, get closer. -(GUN FIRING) -OFFICER: (LAUGHING) Take that! (BELL RINGING) (FIGHTING SOUNDS) (LAUGHING) You had quite a day, Prince Loudovic. Have no fear little wolf. I'll turn your weak blood into real Wolfenberg blood. Just wait. (LAUGHING) Ah! (SNORING) Hey! Hey! Wolfy, wake up! -What's got into you, Wolfy? -Huh, oh, it's just you. I'm sorry, Tom. I'm tired. I've never been so sleepy. Hey, hey wait no, don't go back to sleep. -We need to talk. Listen we have to... -Tomorrow. Okay? Right now, I need to sleep. Wolfy, we have to go home, to Rabbit Land. -Don't you like being here? -What? You have to be joking. I'm stuck with bears! Hey! With bears! -Oh, bears are so cute and so soft! -Get up! Stand up! Stand up! Huh? Huh? What? What! While you're posing as a wolf in your big bed, I'm out in the barn with the bears on a straw bed, and my bed stinks and the animals stink. Everything stinks here. So this is over, do you hear me? I am getting out of here! Listen, Tom, be a bit patient. You'll see. Things will change for us. It will be great. -Since I'm the... Since I'm the, since I'm the... -The what? -The prince... -The prince of what exactly? Argh! Hey, wake up! I...am...the...Prince...of... Wol...fen...berg. I didn't get that. Guess that's it. We were talking and that's so typical of Wolfy. One, two! One, two! Hello, my Prince. -Fine day to go trekking, right? -Hello there, brother wolf. (BOTH ROARING) -(WOLFY LAUGHING) -Right back at you. WOLFY: I'm so hungry. I wouldn't mind a lamb or two to eat for breakfast. Good for you, Wolfy. Tomorrow is a big day. Hey, you gotta eat, right? That's what they say. (LAUGHING) (BOTH LAUGHING) -Stop everything you're doing. We're leaving. -Really? I'm following your advice, leave Wolfy with his pals. If he wants to play wolf, he can do it without me around here! I told you. Once a wolf, always a wolf! Come on, come on, come on, quickly put on something warm! The beautiful redhead inside the red car, remember all that? -Well? -Yes, but no! What do you mean "Yes, but no?" -Yes, but well, not today. -When, then? How should I know when to go? Tomorrow maybe. Okay. But not before tonight's tasty dinner! -What dinner? -It's the opening ceremony of the Carne Festival tonight! He just delivered this dress. Just look at it, so elegant! -Isn't it just beautiful? -Uh wait, "He?" Who's "he"? Well who do you think? The Prince! Lou-Andrea. You change your mind all the time, don't you? Fickle vixens often change their path. So tell me what does that old white thing, with his yellow fangs have -that I don't have, huh? -Imagine if he marries me! Princess of Wolfenberg. What do you think of that? Yeah, how about that! Well, sorry for bothering you in the middle of a daydream! I have to go! -Oh, don't take it badly, Tom! -Of course not! I love it when girls come and beg you to dump your best friend only to tell you that the next day they're going to marry the rich prince. Oh, just try to understand. Well, sorry, we rabbits just have no imagination! He will love it. It's incredible! (GLASS CLINKING) Hello predators, good hunters, I am ferociously happy to declare open the Carne Festival. Tonight, I have some very big news for all of you. But first, all of us shall share together this modest banquet. Winston... (CROWD GASPING) I am just dying to know what your big news is my dear prince! Eat up, my vixen, or else you just might be eaten. Oh, my prince! -Someone's going to fall from a great height tonight! -Ah! -Uh, they will? Who will? -The redheaded vixen! She thinks she's the big news! Her royal wedding with the prince. Oh, I see! Hey, I know the big news, and it's not her! -It's not about her at all! -Oh no? The news is about me, I'm going to get a big promotion now. That's great! Is that good? Leader of the pack, lad. It's the greatest distinction that exists in Wolfenberg! And it's all thanks to you! I turned a spineless hick from the boonies into a real wolf in less time than it can take you to say, "Boogaloo!" -Boogaloo? -Yes, boogaloo! (CROWD MURMURING) Are you guys all ready? (STUTTERING) How do we get in? It's simple! Jump off the dead trunk, between the bushes, grab the branch and then bounce off the tree, jump into midair, backward somersault, and finally land on top of the bear house roof. No sweat! You were just joking right? No? You were not joking? Those were excellent chicks. (GLASS CLINKING) My good friends, now that you've all eaten your fill, I'm going to announce my news. Your prince for a long time has been a lone old wolf. Until recently, someone new in my life changed all of that in a way I couldn't have predicted. Please allow me to present Loudovic de Wolfenberg. Yes, he is my second cousin, the long-lost son of our late, lamented Olympe. Recently he was just a timid, naive little wolf. But he became a most true and noble Wolfenberg! So, for this year's Carne Festival, I've decided to entrust the honorable task of leader of the pack... And the winner is... -To Loudovic! -(GRUNTS) GUESTS: (CHANTING) Loudovic! The Longfangs are showing off! Typical. Why was my father only a rodent? Why are rabbits rabbits? Why are vixens vixens? You should know that we can eat, actually eat anything we want, including tasty rabbits. Don't come near me with your stinky breath. (SCREAMING) Backward somersault, and then bounce... (STUTTERING) We did it! Well, well, we've found the soft toy. What are you doing down here, fuzzy creature? -Where's your pal at? -Oh, Wolfy? Up there. Probably having a lot of fun inside. Having a ball at the festival. -Already changed sides? -Yeah, that figures. Oh yeah, Mr. Wolfy thinks that he's a big bad wolf from Wolfenberg. He's the son of Olympe, he's direct heir to the throne! You're surprised by that? -Uh, who is? -Your friend is. -The real sovereign is your old pal Wolfy. -Huh? Uh, Wolfy? The bloodthirsty wolves' reign has gone on long enough. Lou-Andrea, usurper, white vermin, that foul assassin! It's time to pay for your crimes, you scoundrel! I didn't know that you could swing like that! You're multi-talented, Loudovic. Loudovic, it's funny, I should hate you and yet, I adore you! You should hate me? Why should you? -Is it because you thought I was spineless? -No! Because you messed up my lovely little plans for the future! Scarlett, can I ask you a question? -Go ahead. Is it mean? -Do you believe all you say? Yes... No... Uh, not really... Yeah, kind of... -Let's just say I often change my mind. -Hmm. So when you say you adore me... Do you want the truth? When I say I adore you, I mean it. But I also think, be careful, they're mean in Wolfenberg. They are going to eat my cute little wolf up. And then I say, "Is this wolf a good wolf for me or not?" -You get it? -Oh yeah, I think so. But, you know, I'm a fast learner. Here, I'll show you a wolf trick I just learned. (HOWLING) That's odd. Normally, the moon appears when you do that. (LAUGHING) You crack me up. You're just really unreal. No, no, I assure you, it usually works well. I'll start again. (CLEARS THROAT) (HOWLING) Huh! Wow! -You see, you see? -Huh! -(LAUGHING) -Whoo-hoo. So, Your Mighty Highness, it seems pretty clear you steal my exes when my back's turned, is that right? Hey, it's Captain Thingy! It seems pretty clear to me that you're in league with the worst schemers of this land. Who asked you, dummy? You're the ones who are rebels. Silence, you hussy! There isn't a minute to lose. You need to follow us into the forest, you're in great danger! Let go of me right now. -You should know I'm... -You're Prince Loudovic. I know! You know who I am? It seems that Simon-Edgar warned the Nofangs of our arrival here in town. The Nofangs? You, you're the Nofangs? Tom, you're with them now? They're the ones that killed my mother. -Guards, come now! -No, no, Wolfy, wait Wolfy! You've got it all wrong! Go on, gray wolves, get all of them! Oh no! The gray wolves! Get them now! (GRUNTING) Gray wolves! -(SNARLING) -(GRUNTING) -Let go of him! -Let go of me! Let go of Tom, now! Let go of him! Wolfy! Wolfy! (CHANTING) Brother wolf, what is your name? Uh, Wolfy. Uh, Loudovic of Wolfenberg. Before the brotherhood, are you prepared to prove that you are one of us? Yeah! Of course! Then face the trial by blood. -Whatever's in that bag... -(MOANING) ...claw it, maul it, bite it. Kill it! (GROWLING) (GRUNTING) Oh! Try to concentrate, my girl. Your mind's not on it. Um, please excuse me, my prince, I... -I was wondering... -Ah, it's about that little idiot, isn't it? Are you starting to grow attached to him, my dear? Growing attached, Your Majesty? You must really not know little Scarlett very well. No, no, I just thought you, you wanted to get rid of him. Instead, it seems that you've kept him around... Don't talk so much and just scratch. Scratch! It's the only thing you're good for after all. Your wish is my command, Prince. Okay, that's good. Leave me alone, now. (SCOFFS) -Cornelia! -(CAWS) Ahhh! I'm listening. You must go and hunt the Chameleon Doe. To the bloody hill that can be found. Where that witch must unravel. Will be unraveled. The arrow will designate. The person it must designate. I'll do exactly as you say, Cornelia. But, if you have deceived me... -(SNARLS) -(CROW CAWS) Good hunting, Your Highness. (SQUEAKING) (BEARS GROWLING) (SQUEALING) May I remind you of the rule? It's simple. Death to the prey, and show no mercy! Those with the best spoils win the grand hunt! Our guests may start the hunt. It's that way, go and hunt! (GRUNTING, GROWLING) (SNIFFLING, SQUEALING) (SNICKERING) And now, we get down to the real business! (BIRDS CHIRPING) (GRUNTING) Quack, quack! Quack, quack! (MUFFLED) Quack, quack! The hunters are arriving. It's time for the final act! Are you ready for a fight, Tom? -Is Wolfy with them? -The message doesn't say. Hold on! He's not just there, he's in uniform, and he's carrying the pack's pennant! We are way too late. That's it. They've made a wolf out of him. He is a wolf! Well, more or less... I don't understand with all those years we spent trying to get him to overcome his bloodlust... And now it's all for nothing! (SIGHS) He was my friend, you know. My dearest friend. Ah, you're a rabbit who's after my own heart. An idealist! Right, action! (PANTING) (GROWLING) (CHUCKLES) (LAMB BLEATING) -(THUD) -(WHIMPERING) (GRUNTING, GROWLING) (SQUEAKING) (SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) Wow. Was it that animal? Extraordinary! She's what's really at stake here, my boy. She's the Chameleon Doe. To the bloody hill that can be found... Silence... Vixen! You're just being tolerated by us wolves. Don't forget it. She is the soul and spirit of the all the land here. Whoever kills the doe... Is the master of the forest, my boy. That's why I must have her, for myself. Lieutenant, deploy your wolves. Force out the doe. But don't kill her! She will be mine alone. And she will die, by my own hand and teeth! (GROANS) (BEAR ROARS) (HORN BLOWING) (GASPS) There she is! Tally ho! Tally ho! (PRINCE GROANING) Uh... Prince? (MOANING IN DISTANCE) Ow, my head! Your Highness, uh, are you hurt? (GROANING) You should never grow old, my lad. Ah! Just sit down, just sit down, Your Majesty. I'll go get help. Ah. No, no, no. You have better things to do. You need to get that Chameleon Doe for me now, Loudovic. Do you hear? Take my bear Big Guy and hunt her down for me. Go and be my arm, my boy. But, but Your Wolfness, I don't know how... I know that you have the stuff of a Wolfenberg. I can feel it in my blood! Here, here. Put this on... So my people don't have to see that their prince is so weak. Go, my boy. -(BEAR GROWLS) -Go. (EVIL LAUGH) What an idiot! What have you done now? If anything happens to Wolfy, then I'm going to... (LAUGHING) You're truly forgetting yourself. You're out of your league, my dear, you should go home. Or you'll find yourself skewered on something. (EXHALES) I'm going to deal with you later. (EXHALING ANGRILY) Pr-pr-pr-practically ready, Ca-ca-Captain! So who's going to set off the trap? I want a really tough guy. I'll do it. You, little Tom? The Prince is dangerous, you know? Terrible, nasty! I know, I know. Hats off to him, people! This rabbit's a real man! (GROANING) Wow! (SHOUTING) (YELPING) -Tom! -Huh! Prince Lou-Andrea, you must now pay for your treachery! The Forest Tribunal has already sentenced you for crimes against all of mankind! Die, you most foul criminal! (WHIMPER) -No, Tom! -I knew it, a traitor! -Infiltrator! -He was a deceitful little thing. Tell me why are you trying to save this traitorous prince? It's not the... You should take off... Argh! Uh, this hurts! (GASPS) (STUTTERING) My goodness! I almost killed Loudovic instead of the Prince. You should leave me here. I'm done for... -I'll only slow you down. -Stop, stop, stop. Please! Please keep still. Tell me Loudovic, why were you wearing the usurper's mask, and also riding his bear? -Tell me why. -That was well-spotted, pet! Oh, well. You and your rebels were counting on the Chameleon Doe to lead me here, but I turned your trap on you, instead. Now, I have you where I want you! You moth-eaten rebels! You won't be annoying me anymore. I'll make sure of that. If you weren't such a lousy shot with that crossbow, you'd have killed the heir instead of hitting that rabbit! You jerk! Scumbag! It's too bad your last words sorely lacked any kind of panache! -Kill them all, right now! -Huh? The prince as well, Your Majesty? Yes of course, especially him! No, actually the little brat I will deal with personally. Musket! Uh, it's just that I think the little guy's actually nice. Grrr, he's nice? Since when does a wolf ever find his prey nice? You're a killer and don't you ever forget that for a second. Give me that musket right now, dammit. That's an order! No don't shoot at him! I'm in the line of fire. That rabbit is priceless... To the very end! -(FEMALE SINGING) -Now, what? -Huh? -Ouch! Wait, it's that song... Oh, no! Not her, not now! Wolfy, my son... Mother! It's my mom! Who did this to you? Which one of you tried to hurt my little boy? I did, Your Majesty. A regrettable mistake. Well, then, bravo! You're left alone for three seconds and you try to kill your brother! Your brother! What brother? (SHOT FIRED IN AIR) Excuse me, sorry, to interrupt your family pow-wow like this. So, Lulu, you're getting old, since when do you need a gun to assert your power? Your fangs used to suffice, as I recall. Isn't that right, cousin? Ugh! She gets on my nerves. I will shoot her! Wolfy? Are you hurt anywhere? -I'm in a lot of pain. -Look out, Mom! -Or he's gonna try... -Oh, don't you worry, honey. That old fool has always had a soft spot for me. Aren't I right, Dede? Quiet down, Olympe! We could have reigned together as a couple over Wolfenberg. Forever, as the most powerful rulers in our line. If only you'd chosen me over that dirty goat! My Boukto was worth a hundred of you, you old wreck! -Boukto? -Boukto, yes! Leader of the rebels. Your father, your daddy. Huh? What, what're you saying? I had a dad too? Yes, we had a father, and that wolf right there had to kill him to gain the throne! Oh, wait a sec. So you're saying, you're, really my brother? Your sister, Wolfy... Your big sister, Nina! Nina? You were way too young to remember, when we were separated by the rebellion. Wait, he's a goat? Uh, I mean, her! Uh, hang on a second. If your father was a goat, that means you're half-goat and half-wolf right? But you're half-rabbit and half-cutie pie! (SIGHS) Enough! (SNARLS) (GUN FIRING) Ahhh! Lieutenant, massacre those people! Massacre? Are, are you absolutely sure of that? I'm absolutely sure, you wretch! Okay, okay, okay. Uh, um... Gray Wolves, go forward! Go, Fiorella! (LAUGHS) They're just flowers, Lieutenant! They're plants, you fools! Get rid of all this! They may just be plants, but, but they, they bite! (WHIMPERING) (GRUNTING) Cornelia! Yes, Cornelia, the spirit of the forest. (WHIMPERS) Have no fear, little rabbit. I've come here to put things as they should be. Ah, I feel better. Wolfy! No! I'm going to punch lots of little holes into this bastard! Argh! I am prince of this kingdom! I... I am in command. I have the power of life. Oh, oh! Mom! Wolfy, my son! We can safely say His Highness has just abdicated. (LAUGHS) Ah, I think there's good news at last for Wolfenberg! (CROW CAWING) Wow! Oh! Since the Prince has abdicated, a new prince shall now be appointed. Uh! Oh! Your Majesty, my good friends, my mission has come to an end. Hey, ma'am! I don't... I don't want to keep this crown. Here, Tom! (CHUCKLES) Prince Tom. No, no, no way! I don't accept. We rabbits are naturally democratic. Here you go, Captain. -(GASPS) -It's for you. That's quite enough already, children. Stop playing with that crown. It's for your mother, after all. And so, long live, Princess Olympe. Long live, Mom! Mmm. Ahem, and me? Uh so, no-one kisses me then? (CAR HORN BLOWING) Okay, okay. I'm coming. What's that you're bringing home? A present for Mom. It's a, uh, souvenir from Wolfenberg. -Uh, ah. -Ah, here, hold that. You don't actually want to take this thing? Yeah, uh, well I do. We'll just put it between us. Argh, you're joking. Hey! Bye you, guys! Ciao, my princess, mi amor! Ciao! Goodbye, my Wolfy. Don't forget your mother. Goodbye, Mom. Hey guys, take me with you. There's nothing here for me now. (SCOFFS) Scarlett! In you go. Come on, come on, we're leaving. Oh, I love traveling! Hey, wait a second. If Scarlett's not here, who'll look after Lou-Andrea? -Winston? -It's been dealt with, ma'am. Argh! All things considered, I wonder if I preferred working with the bears. (LAUGHING)
