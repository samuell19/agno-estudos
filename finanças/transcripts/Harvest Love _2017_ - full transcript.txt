Paging Dr. Malcolm to room 413. Dr. Malcolm... Thought I might find you here. Hiya, doc. How are you feeling today, Henry? Not too bad. Better than yesterday. Well, now that you're up and walking, I thought I'd get you started on rehab tomorrow. How does that sound? Good enough to give you my dessert, and believe me, it was the best thing on my tray this afternoon. I really appreciate the offer, but I don't want to spoil my dinner. I have an eight-year-old waiting for me at home. - Well, see you tomorrow. - You bet. Paging Dr. Gilson to emergency. Dr. Gilson. Hey, Jim. Hey, Dr. Gilson, we have an appendectomy. 22-year-old male. I know you've been here since 7:00 this morning, and I wouldn't ask, but the on-call surgeon is stuck in traffic, so... I'm supposed to be going home to have dinner with my son. I just need to make a call first. Thank you. I will let the patient know we've got one of our best surgeons coming in. Paging Dr. West. Nurses' station 2. - I'm sorry I'm so late, Ruth. - It is not a problem. - How was Andy tonight? - A little on the quiet side. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. There's a plate for you in the oven. All you have to do is heat it up. How did you know that I wouldn't have time to eat? Well, I've worked for you long enough to figure that out. Thank you so much... For everything. - Get some sleep. - Thank you. I'll try. - Bye. - Bye. I love you. - Hi, honey! - Hi, mom. Is everything all right? Why are you calling so late? Shoot. I always forget whether we're eight hours ahead or behind you. Cameroon is eight hours ahead. How's dad? He's great, but how are you? You look tired. It's been a rough day. I had seven surgeries, a board meeting, and rounds, so... I didn't make it home before Andy went to bed... Again. Well, that can't be good for you... Or for Andy. Andy's doing okay. You need to take some time off and relax. Doesn't Andy have a fall break coming up? Yeah, he does, but I just... I don't have time, you know? I have patients, and... And you're not the only surgeon in Seattle. They'll find someone to cover for you. I haven't been up there in years. I don't even know if Andy would like it, and... I don't know, mom. It's probably a pretty crazy idea. No, what's crazy is you burning yourself out like this... And burning your house down. Is that smoke I see behind you? Just my dinner burning. You know what, mom? I'm going to call you back. Love you. Okay, hurry up, Andy. We don't want to be late. It's okay. - When was this? - Yesterday. - Honey, you were in this? - Yeah. The whole class was. - Why didn't you tell me about it? - You were working. Honey, I would have made time for this. You missed my spelling bee, so... I didn't think you could come for this. Listen, I know I missed that, but I told you how sorry I was. - I had an emergency surgery. - It's no big deal. Paging Dr. Rothstein. Dr. Rothstein... Dr. Gilson! Hi. - Hi... - Sheila Myman. You removed my kidney stones last month. Yes, of course. What are you doing back here? You're not sick again, I hope. No, just visiting a friend. Well, I hope your friend feels better, and if there's anything I can do, let me know. Dr. Matlets, recovery room 6. Dr. Matlets, recovery room 6. Do you remember Sheila Myman? Yes. Nice woman. Kidney stones last month. Why? I just passed her in the hall, I had no idea who she was. It's my job to keep all the patients straight, and to keep you on schedule. Well, moving forward, could you please schedule a little more time for me to get to know them? You're a general surgeon, not a general practitioner. You don't have that kind of time. Dr. Weber is wondering if you can cover for him this weekend and be on-call? Doesn't anyone think I have a life outside of this hospital? Unless no one else can do it. Would you be able to clear my schedule the week of Andy's school break? It won't be easy, but I've been known to work a miracle or two. Great. I think I'm going to take my mom's advice and do something for Andy and myself. Don't forget about the new promotion. They're still circling candidates for the spot. It's a week of owed vacation time, so it shouldn't affect their decision. Okay... Anything else you want me to pack? You're not going to need swim trunks on the farm. If we were going to Florida or Hawaii like some of my friends, instead of a farm, we would. Well, it's not just a farm. It's our family's farm. Are you sure you wouldn't rather go to Hawaii? Nice try, but I can't go too far from the hospital, okay? The farm's only a couple of hours away. It'll be fun, you'll see, and we might even be there around harvest time. I'm just excited to spend time with you, mom. Me too, Andy. Me too. I forgot how much I love it here. There are a lot of trees. There sure are. Do you know what kind of trees they are? Pine! That's right. You are so smart. Is that why the town's called Pineview? See, you're already starting to appreciate it. - Mom, are we lost? - No, I've been following all the signs. It just seems like we've been on this road for a long time. What is this guy doing? Just stay in the car, okay? I've got this. It's a one-Lane road. You're supposed to yield to oncoming vehicles. I know. - Okay, so why aren't you yielding? - Because I got here first. It's not about who got here first. You have a yield sign, and I don't. So you're supposed to back up and pull over. Or... you could. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that you're not from around here, are you? No, I'm not, but what difference does that make? Besides, I have a child in my car, and I don't want to risk going into a ditch or getting a flat or something like that. Not likely. Okay, well then... Why don't you show me how it's done? You know, so I'll know for next time? Okay. Looks like I got a flat. I feel terrible. Can we at least give you a lift? I'll be fine. Just take it easy on the next guy, all right? Yeah, absolutely, of course... And again, I'm really sorry. So, what do you think? It's big. Come on, let's go find the key. Your grandma said it's where we always used to keep it. Was I ever here before? Your daddy and I brought you here when you were very little. Your great-grandpa Gilson, who was my grandpa, was still alive back then, and we had Thanksgiving here. - I don't remember. - Of course, you don't. You were only a year and a half old, but there are plenty of pictures inside. At least, there used to be. You see that? I did that when I was your age. I was running around outside, playing, and they told me to stay off the porch, and I didn't listen, and the poor guy lost his nose. - Did you get in trouble? - I didn't get dessert that night, and your great-grandma Gilson's pear cobbler was the best thing you've ever tasted. Ever! Right where grandma said it would be. Come on, let's go inside. Okay! Why don't you take the bedroom upstairs, the first one on the right? - That's my old room. - It's not a girl's room, is it? You're safe. It was redone years ago. And you see these trees over here? I planted these with great-grandpa Gilson. Hey! What are you so interested in? I was just wondering what that man was doing? I think he's stealing our pears. Look, go over there and call the sheriff, and tell him that we have a pear thief in Gilson orchard, and to come quick. Look, I don't know who you think you are, but this is private property. You can't go around picking other people's fruit. I can if I work here. - You? - Yep, me. If it isn't the road hog. Listen, I am so sorry about that flat. I hope you were able to change it all right. Well... A half an hour of my time, and I was all good. I'd be happy to pay for it... The tire? Not necessary. Long as you learned the rules of the road. Yeah, I did. I did indeed, Mr...? Will Nash. I manage the farm here. I take it you're Grace and Eli's daughter. Yeah, they didn't tell me you were coming. My mom was supposed to call you, but she can be kind of forgetful, so I'm not really surprised. Listen, my son and I, we are only going to be here for a week, so you don't have to worry about us. Hopefully, we'll stay out of your way. I'm sure it'll be fine. I take it you're the young fella who called about a pear thief? I'm so sorry. Hey, Will. You called the sheriff on me? Listen, this was just a really big misunderstanding. Will may be a lot of things, but he's no thief. So, if there are no arrests to be made, I'm going to head back into town. Okay, thanks. Sorry. Andy, this is Will. He manages the farm, and we are going to stay out of his way this week, okay? Andy! Catch. Thanks, Will. I was getting hungry. Sorry! You know, I was surprised when I heard you retired. I never thought you were going to leave the farm. Neither did I, but these old bones did me in. Been a long time since I saw you, though, and Andy, you were just a baby last time we met. - So you knew my great-grandpa? - Sure did! I've known four generations of Gilsons. I've managed the Gilson farm for over 40 years. I was first hired by your great-grandparents, and when your grandpa inherited the farm, he made me manager, because he and your grandma lived in Seattle. Your mom was the third generation, and now you're the fourth. That's pretty cool. - Can I go check things out? - Sure! Lots to see around here. Can I, mom? So... - I take it you met Will. - Yes, I have. Mom told me that you handpicked him to be your replacement? We were lucky to get him. I had to do some fast talking to convince him to take the job. Is that so? Not every day you find a fourth-generation farmer who also happens to be an agronomist. Will is a scientist? You should hear him talk about soil acidity, cross-pollination, hybrid seeds... I don't understand the half of it. How come he doesn't have his own farm? The recession. A lot of the farms around here got bought up by these big corporations that swooped in when the opportunity was right, and quite a few families ended up moving away, including his. Must be tough... Losing your family farm. But after college, Will came back determined to rebuild his family's legacy, and lucky for the Gilsons, he is now on your farm. Mom, look what I found! Sweetie, are you okay? You took a big fall there, didn't you? Ouch! Mom, that hurts! Hi. Is everything okay? I'm a doctor. Maybe I can help. Yes. My son, Bobby, fell and scraped his knee. Okay. Hi. Hi, Bobby, I'm Dr. Gilson. This is my son, Andy. Do you mind if I take a look at your knee? Sure. Andy, maybe you and Bobby would like one of these? - Is that okay? - Yeah. - Hey, you want to draw with me? - Sure. I'm going to take a look at your knee, okay? It's not bleeding. Could you straighten it out for me? All right. Is that okay? Bend it back... It's good. Might be a little bruised, 'Kay? Might want to put some ice on it when you get home. Will do. Dr. Gilson... As in the Gilson pear farm? Yeah, that's us. We haven't seen any of your family here in a long time. Yeah, mom and dad used to come up all the time from Seattle, but they actually joined an organization that's providing medical care overseas, so they haven't been back. Andy and I are just here for a week. That's a shame. You'll miss the harvest festival. Andy would love it. Probably. We have to get back, so... Thank you so much. - Sure! I'm Luna. - Nicole! Pleasure. Same. - They look happy. - Yeah. So this is a pear. We have tons of these at our farm. Awesome! Hey, mom. Hi, honey! I'm glad you're still up. Mom, it's 10:00 A.M., not 10:00 P.M. Oops, I'm never going to get this time difference right. So how are you doing? Really good. I'm still in my pajamas. I haven't been able to do that in years. And how's Andy? Andy's good, but I think he's a little disappointed we didn't go somewhere more exciting. Well, just tell him the farm's not going to be there forever, so he should appreciate it while he can. Why would I tell him that? Well, because your dad and I have decided to put the farm up for sale. But why? Well, none of us are very interested in it, and it's not making much of a profit, so it doesn't seem to make much sense to hold onto it anymore. I suppose not. It feels weird to think that the farm's not going to be in the family anymore. I know, but... Maybe it's time we all made a change. Hi, this is Dr. Gilson. I understand that Mr. Mitchell is back in the hospital. Could you give me an update on his condition? Yes, I am on vacation, but I just wanted to check in. Well, please tell Dr. Gordon if he needs to consult me, he can reach me on my cell. No, it's no bother at all. Okay, thanks. Hey, I know we're on vacation, but I wanted to check in on a patient. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's no different than being at home. Yeah, but except at home, we're not surrounded by orchards and mountains and clean air. You know what? If you're done with your breakfast, then why don't you put away your colored pencils and grab your coat, because I want to show you something super cool. I forgot how beautiful this place is. It's awesome, mom. It is. "The best pear ground is where you can see pine trees when you're standing in an orchard". I can't believe I remembered that. My grandpa Gilson used to say it all the time. So, all of these are pear trees? Yep, as far as the eye can see. You know, when I was your age, I used to go out into the orchard, and I would find a pear. I would pick it, I would take a bite, and it tasted just like Autumn. It was heavenly. Let's try one. What's it taste like? Not Autumn. This one's not ripe yet. Come on, buddy. Hey. Hi! So, how does it feel to be back? It feels great. I'm kind of hungry. Can I go inside and get a snack? Yeah, there's some granola bars in the cupboard. Thanks. I have a question for you. Shoot. Where are the ripest pear trees? Those would be... Over there, where you thought I was stealing them. You know what? You'll see. One day, you'll think that's a very funny story. It's a funny story now... Least the whole town thought so. What? Well, Pineview's a small town. Word travels fast. Noted. - Hi. - Hi! I brought you a lasagne. I wanted to thank you for yesterday. My gosh, that is so sweet. Please, come in. Hi, Bobby. Hey, Andy. Do you play soccer? Yeah. Great, because I have a ball in the car. I was wondering if you wanted to kick it around? Sure. Come on, let's go. Bobby seems no worse for the wear. Like it never even happened. How are you two enjoying the farm? I'm easing into it. It's not too quiet out here for you, is it? Quiet is exactly what we need. I've been so burned out at work, I've barely spent any time with Andy, so it's been the perfect place for us. Sorry if I scared you all, but we have a bit of an emergency. I just got a call about a tractor accident at the Hennessy farm, and one of the farmhands is injured. The ambulance is about 30 minutes out, so I was hoping that Dr. Gilson, you would come on out there with me and see what you could do. Yeah, of course. Don't worry, I'll stay with the boys. Thanks. Need my help? Yeah, might need an extra set of hands. All right, I'll take my truck. I'll follow you out there. Hank, keep an eye on things 'til I get back. Yeah, of course. - You ready? - Yeah. Your mom's like a superhero. Yeah... I guess she kind of is. Come on, boys, let's go inside. Come on. Give me the news. How bad is it? Well, the good news is, you're going to live. The bad news is, I think it's a broken tibia. I'm going to need to stabilize your leg until the ambulance gets here. Do we have anything around here we can use? Sure, if there's a couple fence slats. Would those work? Yeah, that should work. Here. Thanks. Okay. You're going to be fine. I'm going to splint your leg to immobilize it. Once I do that, we'll elevate it, and your pain should subside. Okay. Easy... Good job. Hang in. Hey, sheriff, it just dawned on me... How did you know I was a doctor? Don't look at me. Well, you know, there's no secrets in a small town. Yeah, so I've been told. Nicole's married to my cousin, Tom, and I heard how you checked out Bobby's knee. Anyhow, I'm going to follow the ambulance. Will, would you mind taking the doc home? Yeah, sure. Thanks again, Dr. Gilson. Of course. How come this town doesn't have a doctor? I mean, it's not that small. Last one retired. We do have three veterinarians, though. I've got to say, doc, your medical skills are impressive... Better than your driving skills. Yeah? And to think that I have been driving longer than I've been practicing medicine. I'm still the one who got the flat. Which was my fault. Yeah, guess we can agree on that. How'd it go? He has a broken leg, and he's on the way to the hospital, so he should be fine. Thanks again so much for staying. Of course. I think the boys had a good time. By the way, I noticed a leak under your kitchen sink. You don't want to let that go too long. I won't. Thanks for letting me know. I'll go grab Bobby. Nice to see you, Will. You know, I could fix that leak for you, if you'd like. That'd be great. Thanks. Andy, would you hand me the channellocks up there? These? That's the one. Thank you. Actually, do you want to watch, or do you want to come over here and help me? I would, but I don't know how. I'm not a plumber. That makes two of us, but you don't have to be a plumber to know how to fix a leak, and it's a pretty handy thing to know how to do. What do you say? Sure. All right. Why don't you come over here beside me? I need somebody with a strong hand to tighten this slip joint right here. Like this? Did I do it? You did! You fixed the leak. Good job. Will, would you like to stay for dinner? Nicole brought over a lasagna, and we have plenty. I would. There's still a few things around the farm I need to take care of before it gets too dark. Andy? Andy, thanks for your help. Couldn't have done it without you. Good night, Luna. Bye, Andy. Thanks, Will. Hey, Andy! What do you think about doing a little project together after dinner? What kind of project? Well, I found my grandmother's recipe box, and I was thinking it might be fun to make her famous pear cobbler. Have you ever made anything like that before? No, but I'm not afraid to try. So, what do you say? You want to be my taste tester? I'll bake, and you taste? Call me when you need me! How do poached pears sound? Like something I wouldn't eat. Careful now. You know, you shouldn't sneak up on people when they're halfway up a ladder. I wasn't going to let you fall... Though I do think I should show you the proper way to pick a pear. You know, I spent quite a few autumns here. I think I know how to pick fruit. Let me show you. You need to lift and slightly twist, and if it's ripe, it should just land in your hand... With the stem attached. I think I've got the hang of it now. Thank you. These smell delicious. I only hope I can do them justice. What are you planning to make with them? Well, I've botched a few pear cobblers already, so I was thinking about making something less ambitious, like sliced pears in a salad. Well, if you botch that, too, there's plenty of other pears around this farm. Yeah, so I've noticed, so since these are nice and ripe, I assume the others aren't far behind. When will you be harvesting? Next few days, I'd imagine. I'm going to check the outer farm later today. Then I guess it's likely to be your last harvest here. Mine too. Parents tell you their plan? Yeah. It took me by surprise a little. I mean, I know I haven't spent a lot of time here lately, but there was just something so comforting about knowing that the farm was here. Does that sound silly? No, no. A farm is more than home. It's heartland. So what are you going to do next? Got an idea or two. Hey, by the way, why is there a lock on the greenhouse? Something in there you don't want me to see? No... Just broken glass and some planters laying around, and I didn't want anybody wandering in and getting hurt... And I have to go back to work. See ya, doc, and say hi to Andy for me. Will do. - Hi! - Hi. I see you found the best bakery in town. Yeah, I had to. I failed at so many attempts at the pear cobbler. I promised Andy dessert tonight, so we're settling for apple pie. Where is Andy today? He's on the farm. Will asked Andy to help him get the harvest equipment ready, so... Hey, what's all this? It's for the harvest festival. I'm on the decoration committee. Yeah? You want some help? That would be great. My car's just over there. Do you want to follow me? Yeah, sure. Great! Go ahead. Hi, honey! Hi! Luna, this is my husband, Tom. Hi. It's nice to meet you. You too! I've heard a lot about you. Yeah? Well, then, I guess it's true what they say about small towns. You can't even turn a corner without running into someone who knows you. That's definitely true about this town. Well, it seems like the fall harvest festival has become a really big deal. Gets bigger every year. We've got every county in the state participating. Tom's the event chair. I hope you can stick around for the festival. We haven't had a Gilson in person in... I don't know how long. It sure would be nice for the town if you stayed. I wish we could, but I have to get back to work, and Andy has to go back to school. Luna Gilson! Fancy running into you here. Yes, and it's lucky that you did. What are you talking about? Well, you're walking with a limp, and I can tell from the way that you're grimacing, that you're experiencing a lot of pain. It's not so bad. Just an old injury from falling off a ladder. When did you do that? Which time? Would you mind if I take a look at your knee? What, here? On the picnic table, young man. You have some swelling. Are you experiencing stiffness in your knee? I am. Think you may have developed a little bit of arthritis, Farley. Listen, keep it on ice, and elevate it when you can. - Do I have to? - Doctor's orders. Hi, mom. Isn't this awesome? Yeah, it is. You ever been on one? Me? No. Me neither. No? You want to ride out with me? Can I, mom? Just be careful. Yes! Buckle up. Have fun. You know what this is? What's that? It's a bite mark. - From what? - Squirrels. That's how we know if the trees are ready to harvest. We check the fruit that's fallen to the ground. If they've got bite marks like this one, it means the squirrels threw them down because they weren't sweet enough. So that means these aren't ready yet? That's exactly what that means. We'll come back and check them in a couple of days. I didn't know squirrels ate pears. My dad and I used to feed them in the park, but we gave them nuts. Did you know my dad? No, I didn't. He sometimes called me Andrew. That's my real name, you know. His name was Phillip Walters. I'm a Gilson-Walters. So you have two names? Lucky! Most people only get one. Well, my dad said it was special having two. I want to show you something. Here we go. You see that? Must have been your dad that carved those initials. Wonder why he did that? Well, I think he did it to show how much he loves you and your mom. You think this will be here forever? Sure of it. Hey, mom. Hey, sweetheart. Did you have a nice time with Will? Yeah! He's a cool guy. Is that an apple you're eating? I think so, but Will had a funny name for it. There was a whole lot of them, and it's really good. Want a bite? Good? It's delicious. Yeah, I know. Best apple I've ever tasted. Did Will pick this from one of our trees? But we don't grow apples on the farm. What's that? This is my memory box. I started it when I was about six or seven, and it's all the special items that I collected from my time here on the farm. You must have spent a lot of time here. We sure did. I don't believe it. This is a ticket from my very first harvest festival. I had such a great time. Is this grandpa's? Actually, it's mine. I played first base. I didn't know you could play baseball. Grandpa and I used to play every single year at the harvest festival's father-son game. Father-son game? But you're a girl. Well, they bent the rules a little. Hang on, sweetheart, I've got to take this. It's Nicole. Hey, Nicole. Volunteer at the harvest tomorrow? We'd love to. Okay, great. Mom, want to play catch? Sure! Let's go. So, tomorrow... Hey, mom! Guess what this is. It's a cornucopia. You know, it's too bad you're doing all this work and you're not even going to be at the festival. It's the best time all year. There's tons of food, all types of carnival games. There's contests... Even a softball game. It is kind of a shame you can't stay longer. Well, Andy and I have to get back to Seattle, but we're happy to be volunteering just the same. Excuse me, I need a refill. Darn! We're out of coffee. Well, if you can keep an eye on Andy, then just give me 15 minutes. I'll go into town and do a coffee run. You've got it. Make sure it's good and strong. Hey, bud, I am going into town. I'll be right back, okay? - You good to color? - Yep. Sweetheart, your hands are covered in paint. Why don't you go inside and get washed up? Is there any way we could stay for the festival? No, I'm afraid not. We've got to go home. I know. Your patients need you. - Don't you miss your friends? - Well... this place isn't so bad. Go clean up. Hey, Hank, have you seen Will? I think he's in the greenhouse. Thanks. Will? Are you in here? Hey, Hank. Hey there, Luna. Can you point me in the direction of the apple trees? We don't have any apple trees, just pears. You sure? Sure as I'm standing here. Thanks. Have a good walk. I heard you were looking for me. Actually, I was looking for an apple like the one you gave Andy yesterday. He said you got it from one of our trees. We don't have apple trees. But... Saw you in town earlier. I didn't think you did. You seemed like you were in the middle of something important. 'Cause I was in a suit? Well, you don't dress like that every day. Well, it wouldn't be very practical for around the farm, now, would it? Well, farm business doesn't always happen on a farm, now, does it? No, it doesn't, and while you're fishing, why don't you check out the pond? I'll see you, doc. Hey, Marcy, how are you? You haven't checked in for a while. I was beginning to wonder about you. Yeah. I guess I forgot. That's a first. Then the trip must be doing you some good. It has... For both of us. I haven't seen Andy this happy in years. Forgot how much I love it here. See what taking some time off can do? But the reason I'm calling is, you'll be back in a few days, so should we start scheduling some surgeries for next week? Yeah, of course... On second thought, do you mind if I call you back? I kind of want to hold off on my schedule for a day or two. Okay. Don't wait too long. Mom? You going somewhere? Just out for a spin. Yeah, well, we usually take the ATV out for farm work, not for joy rides. Well, I was checking to see if the pears are ripe enough to harvest. Do you even know what you're looking for? - Sort of. - Sort of. Set up for the harvest festival is shorthanded. Could use some volunteers. Andy and I can pitch in. All right, well, we'll take my truck, not the ATV. Scoot over. Not very subtle, are they? I think most of the single women in Pineview have tried to flirt with Will at one time or another. Really? Yeah, he's a great catch. Sweetheart! I just got a call confirming that Frank Honeywell is going to be one of the judges in the best pear competition! - That's quite a coup for us. - That's wonderful, honey! Now wait, who is he again? He's one of the biggest food distributors in the state. Winning overall best pear is the brass ring for any farmer. A win like that can really put you on the map. Well, it's been a while, but if I remember correctly, Gilson farms took home that prize quite a few times. Not in the last several years. Yeah, Williamsburg farms has been winning year after year. And I remember that name. Whatever happened to their son, Ronny? He was kind of a know-it-all? No, no, he goes by Ronald now. Yeah, and he's even more of a know-it-all. I guess some people never change. I heard someone say there's a harvest moon starting tonight. You heard right. Ever seen one? Maybe when I was younger, but I don't remember. Let's see... The harvest moon happens once a year, at the beginning of Autumn, and the full moon rises at sunset, so it's brighter than usual, which makes for longer harvest days. I am impressed. My grandpa taught me that. Well, it looks like it might be a clear night. I'll bet we'll be able to get a good view of it. Well, if you're not too tired later, I could show you the best place on the farm to see it. Why don't you let me help you with him? Come on, buddy. Come on, Andy. - Get him into bed all right? - Sure did. I really wish he could have seen it before he conked out. It really is something, isn't it? Not going to see anything like that in Seattle. All those city lights. And too much noise. I can actually hear the crickets chirping here. You have been in the city too long. Those are frogs. What? No! Yes, those are frogs. Are you sure? Pretty sure. Okay, well, whatever that noise is, it's... it's very relaxing. That's something I don't think you do much of. Yeah, well, when you have a eight-year-old kid, and you're an on-call surgeon, you don't really have time to stop and smell the roses... Or the apples, it seems. Come on, what's your secret, Will Nash? I don't have a secret. I just don't reveal much. Yeah, well, that might be a good idea for business, but doesn't that get in the way of having a relationship? Who says I want one? I wasn't... Implying that. I just... I meant... I meant that most people do that at some point or another, so... Well, maybe at some point, I will. Yeah, but I don't get it. I mean, you're a good catch, Will. Nicole's words, not mine... But it is my understanding that you're very popular with the local ladies. Let's just say that a relationship doesn't exactly fit into my plan right now. Which you're not going to tell me. You are persistent, aren't you? Owning my own farm, okay? That's my plan. That's a nice plan! I don't really understand how having a relationship gets in the way of that, though. Sometimes, they do. When I was in medical school, I had a plan, too. No distractions until I finished my residency... And then I met Phillip, and my plan sort of flew out the window. Glad it worked out for you, doc. When I met somebody, threw my plans out the window... It didn't exactly work out for me. I was blindsided. Yeah, things don't always go as you planned. Must have been hard. It was. It still is, sometimes... But I have Andy... Although I've shortchanged him a lot lately. How do you mean? I threw myself into work, and I wasn't really around for Andy enough. The whole point of this trip was to reconnect with him, which I think I've managed to do. What happens when you go back in a couple days? To be honest, I don't know. Up kind of early, aren't you? Couldn't sleep. The moon give you a lot to think about? It did. Do you need to get that? Yeah... But I'm not ready to. Enjoy your walk, Luna. Don't forget to do the lift and twist. Okay, Will, you really have to stop sneaking up behind people. Maybe if certain people stopped showing up where they're not supposed to... And why am I not supposed to be here? Just that these trees are still in the developmental phase. Yeah, well, if it's the same fruit that you gave Andy the other day, I would say it's far more than developed. It's amazing. So, what is all this? Well, first of all, they're not apples, they're pears. I crossbred a rare variety of red seckel with an Asian seuri, so they have the look and coloring of an apple, but the seuri flavor has hints of apricot. So that's why it was so sweet. They also have a longer storage life and less susceptibility to bruising. That's brilliant. So does this fruit have a name yet? Not yet. The scientific name is pyrus phoeniceus. I patented it. I'm being a little cautious about what my next step is. So that explains the secrecy. I met with some potential investors, but they're not sold yet, so I entered it in the harvest festival, and if it wins best overall, that could seal the deal. So why don't you just continue to grow them here? I could never afford to do that on a farm this large. Besides, if your parents actually find a buyer, this farm may not even be here anymore. That's what happened with my folks. Yeah, Farley told me that a corporation took it over. Yeah. Leveled it. Turned it into a shopping mall. That's awful. It was, but taught me that when life knocks you down, you get back up, so that's what I did, and that's what I'm doing. Andy, honey, there's something I want to discuss with you. First of all, I want you to know that I am so sorry for all the plays, and the spelling bees, and the soccer games that I missed. You deserve a mom that's going to be there for you, 'Kay? And I'm hoping that this makes up for that a little. I know it's not a theme park, or what you really wanted to do, but... This hasn't been so bad, and it's been kind of fun watching you try to bake. Yeah, well, I... You know what? You're going to see. I am going to master that cobbler... And you are going to love it. Honey, if you had a choice, would you want to go back to Seattle as planned, or would you maybe want to stick around here a little longer? Could we stay for the harvest festival? That is exactly what I was thinking. Of course, you'd have to do some school work. I think I could call school and get your assignments, but... I want to stay. You didn't even hear the part about school, did you? I get it. If we stay, I still have to study. Yes. All right, I guess we're going to stay a little longer. Hello there, Luna. Well, hello, Ronny. - You remember me. - You're not easy to forget. - Andy, this is Ronny Williamsburg. - It's Ronald now. I hear your farm is up for sale. Must be what brought you back to town. No, it's not. We're on vacation. Then perhaps I'll see you at the harvest festival. You'll see me there, up on stage. My farm has won the top prize seven consecutive years. You mean your family's farm, right? - So nice to see you again, Luna. - You too, Ronny. Hey. Hey, I just came by to let you know I've got to leave and rush over to Olympia. I hope everything's okay? Yeah, there's a glitch in the paperwork for my patent, but I've got to take care of it by the end of today. Sure, yeah. Of course. Take all the time you need. Is there anything I can do to help? No, no, no. Thank you, though. I'll be back first thing in the morning, and if the rain lets up tonight, then tomorrow, we'll start the harvest. I've already let the pickers know. Great! We'll be up bright and early. Will... I... I wanted to let you know that Andy and I are staying an extra week. Was kind of hoping you might. Hey, Will! The rain cleared up. Bad news. Last night's rain downed a tree, and it's blocking the highway, so the road's closed. I'm going to take the detour, but I don't know how long that's going to take, and I'm guessing if I can't get through, the pickers can't either. Okay, so what do we do? Let Hank know what's going on, and call Farley. I'll get there as soon as I can. Sounds good. Farley, hey. It's Luna. I need your help. If these don't get picked soon, they're just going to keep falling to the ground. Okay. Then we need to get organized. Since the pickers and crates aren't here, we're going to have to do this ourselves. Go around the farm, find anything that you can put the fruit in. Buckets, wheelbarrows, boxes... Get creative. I'm going to go get Andy. All hands on deck. All right, guys, let's see what we can find. What's with the suitcase? You going someplace? No, it's for the pears. Great idea! Why don't you grab mine? - Hey! - Hey! My goodness! How did you manage all this? I just put the word out, and everyone was happy to pitch in. - Any word from Will? - He's still on the road. Things aren't as bad as I thought they'd be. Looks like you grabbed the bull by the horns... But I guess you are a Gilson, after all. Well, it's what I'm trained to do. I mean, not the fruit-picking part, but I do deal with emergencies on a daily basis. Looks like you've got a bumper crop this year. Let's get to it. Come on, everybody. There's Will! I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to fire me. Now, why would I do something like that? Everyone's a little late to work sometimes. Speaking of work... Hey, mom, I want to show you something. Honey, hi! Is everything okay? It is now, but it's a kind of a long story. Go get dad. Come here. Hi! Hi. All right. It's harvest day, and I want to show you both something amazing. Can you believe your grandson is picking pears? He loves it! Of course, he does. Exactly what I was doing at his age. It looks like the two of you going up to the farm was just what you needed. Yeah, it really was. Thank you guys so much for always looking out for me. No matter where we are in the world, Luna, we're always there for you. - Love you guys. - Love you too, sweetheart. Don't forget to send us some pictures. I won't. Bye. Well... What did you think of your first harvest? It was really... Really fun. And you, Dr. Gilson? It was exhausting, but exhilarating, though I fear that my suitcase will forever smell like pears. Mom, I think I'm going to go inside. Okay, I'll be in in a few minutes to start dinner. Bye, Will. That was the best day ever. You're welcome. I'll see you tomorrow. So did you get everything straightened out in Olympia? Yeah, that part of the trip went just fine. Matter of fact, while I was up there, I managed to start looking at some properties to buy. In Olympia? No, no, that's just where the land agents are. I'd like to look around here. Well, then I hope you really win that prize, and not just because I want you to beat Ronny Williamsburg, but... Because you really deserve it. I hope the judges agree. See you, doc. Yeah. You too, Will Nash. Okay, let's see. We've got four burgers, seven turkey, eight tuna, two of them on rye, and one Chinese chicken salad. - Who's that one for? - Hank. - Hey, Luna, Andy. - Hey, Tom. How's it going? It's a little bit hectic. How's the harvest coming? We are going to be finished tomorrow, probably. All right! Well, see you on Saturday. I like this place. - The restaurant? - No, Pineview. I wish we could live here forever. Well, how would that work? Well, you could be a doctor here. Sweetheart, I don't think it's that simple. You helped Bobby, and the farmer with the broken leg, and even Farley. You kind of are already the local doctor here, aren't you? Yeah, kind of. Look at this one, mom! Great harvest, everybody. Can I offer you some pear cider to celebrate? You're on. Thanks. Sure. - To the harvest. - To the harvest. Bet you're glad the season's finally over? Actually, no. I've always found it a little bittersweet. What? No, it just... Reminds me of something my grandfather always used to say. "The end of harvest season isn't an ending. It's a time for planting and new beginnings". I never really appreciated that until now. Like the harvest moon got to you. It didn't hurt, but... I don't know, it's just... It's different here. It's better. So I was thinking that Andy and I might stay a while in Pineview. That's quite a change. I know... But I think I might be ready for a change. I don't think I've ever had a candied pear before. Well, I know you haven't. It's really good. Told you so. Hey, mom, a pumpkin-carving context! You should sign up for that. Me? I don't know anything about carving a pumpkin. You're a surgeon. Isn't that kind of what you do every day? He's got a good point. Come on! It's the spirit of the thing. Why not give it a try? You can't be serious. Come on, Dr. Gilson! Please, mom? Step right up. Step right up. - Okay. - Yes! Okay. Okay! The rules are pretty simple. Each contestant has a pumpkin, carving tools, and 20 minutes to do their magic. You'll be judged on creativity, originality, and overall appearance. So... Let's get to it. Go, mom! Okay, contestants, we're at the halfway point. 10 minutes to go. Okay, that's it! Carving tools down, please. Contestants, can you please turn your pumpkins around? Sheriff Jackson, could we have the verdict, please, sir? 'Kay, starry eyes... Looks like someone I arrested last month... And... Interesting. Well done, carvers. Good job... But this is some fancy carving, and I would let Dr. Gilson take out my gall bladder any day, and that's why she's the winner. Mom, can Andy and I go on the hay ride, and then watch the outdoor movie for kids they're showing after? Sure. Have fun. Man, ATV ride, a hay ride, and an outdoor movie? So cool, right? How about we go listen to some music? Sounds good. Since I'm officially done for the night, I wouldn't mind a dance with my wife. How about it, you guys? You know, I've got to check in with the judging committee. I'll catch up with you guys later. They don't announce the winner 'til tomorrow. Never seen Will with jitters before. Well, it is the top prize, so I get that. Shall we go get our dancing shoes on? You guys go ahead. I'm going to check in on the boys, okay, and then have a little look around. See ya! Let's do this! See, the one in the middle originally started as a single pear, then it grew so close to another one that they grew together, and they call that a "marriage fruit". - So... - So? How does it feel to be an award-winning pumpkin carver? Well, I have been asked to carve a few pumpkins for the Halloween dance. So, you know, this whole medical thing doesn't work out, I can always fall back on my carving skills. That mean you're going to be around for Halloween? It's looking like it. Good. Was kind of getting used to having you and Andy around. Is that Farley dancing? Well... Not a lot of single men of a certain age in a small town. He's quite in demand. That's sweet. What is? Watching people in love. Look at Tom and Nicole. Care to give it a try? I meant a dance. I'm a farmer. I'm not much of a dancer. Yeah, but you told Andy you don't have to be a plumber to know how to fix a leak. I did say that, didn't I? You did say that. I did. Looks like the moon came out just for us tonight. Then we better not waste it. Well, for a guy who doesn't know how to dance, you sure have some good moves. Think so? I'm so sorry. It's my mom. It's the middle of the night where they are. I need to take this. I'm so sorry. Mom, is everything all right? Yep, why don't you turn around and see for yourself? What? What are you guys doing here? Surprising you, for starters. The other reason we came back is because we got an offer on the farm. Andy sleeping? Out like a light. Okay, so tell me about this offer on the farm. Why are you so concerned about it? I told you we were putting it on the market. Well, yeah, but that was before. Before what? Before I realized that Andy and I belong here. You can't sell it. Do we have to watch the game, mom? Well, we're not going to watch it. I was kind of hoping we'd play in it. I got them to bend the rules a little bit. What do you say, slugger? Come on, let's play! Bobby! I'm playing, too! All right, Red. Okay, Red, bottom of the ninth. We've got two outs. We're three runs down with bases loaded. Now we got Luna Gilson coming to bat! Go, mom! Come on! Strike one. You can do it! Strike two. All right, Luna! For a mom, you were better than most of the dads. Well, that's because I have my lucky charm. You know, I made this when I was about your age, after I played in the father-son game with grandpa. I want you to have it. Man, getting that home run today off Ronny Williamsburg, just like I did when I was a kid, was still awesome. I don't think Ronny thought so. Okay, everyone! The top prize for this year's harvest festival is about to be awarded, so can we please have everyone head over towards the main pavilion. Thank you. Good luck! Almost two dozen farms throughout the state entered their finest fruits in this last category, best overall pear. Our judges considered four factors... Shape, taste, texture, and skin quality. It's with great pleasure that we award this year's prize to... Will Nash, representing Gilson family farms for their "Gilson Beauty"! Hey, Marcy! Am I calling too early? No, I was just sitting down for breakfast. I have you on speaker phone. How's everything going? Great. Our farm just won the big prize at the harvest festival. That sounds... Quaint. Yeah. Listen, I know I owe you a phone call, and there's something that I want to discuss with you. Wait 'til you hear what I have to tell you first. I just heard the hospital is going to promote you to senior consultant of general surgery. You got the promotion! Pretty amazing, right? I don't know what to say. You're their golden girl. No one works harder than you, and no one deserves this more than you do. It is what every surgeon works toward. You'd be the youngest person ever to hold the position at the hospital. Yeah. It does seem pretty crazy to turn something like that down. Why would you? Listen, Marcy, I've got to call you back. Andy, you up? Yeah. Sweetheart, are you feeling all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I think you're just tired, maybe, from the exciting weekend? Can I go outside now? Sure... yeah, of course. You can eat your breakfast later. Just try to be quiet, okay? Grandma and grandpa are still asleep. Hey. Just the man I was looking for. I have something for you. I saw some of your drawings... Looked like pears and orchards. Thought you might want to learn a little more about them. Thanks, Will. Looks old. It is old. My dad gave that to me when I was about your age, and I figured you'd be the perfect guy to get it next. I love it. You look like you have something on your mind. Everything okay? I heard my mom talking on the phone. She's taking a big new job. So you guys are leaving? Yeah... And everything's going to be just like it used to be. Hey, there you are. Why don't you go inside for a minute? I've got some big news to share with you, grandma, and grandpa. Bye, Will. Thanks for the book. See you, bud. So, will I see you later? I don't think so. Got to make some plans of my own. So what's this big surprise you want us to see? This. What do you think about it for an office space? It's here in Pineview. An office? Yeah. I'm thinking about hanging up my shingle here. After all, this town could use a doctor. Luna, I think that's a wonderful idea! Don't get me wrong, I like the idea, too. Honey, are you sure this is what you really want? I've never been more sure of anything in my entire life. What do you think, Andy? I think I'm confused. Didn't you tell Marcy we were going back to Seattle so you could take a new job? Where did you get an idea like that? I heard you on the phone this morning. Well then, I guess you missed the part where I called her back to turn down the job. You did? I want to stay here in Pineview, too. After all, you're the one who gave me the idea about opening up my own practice here. Wait 'til I tell Will we're not leaving! You told Will we were leaving? Gentlemen, this is the property that I've been talking to you about. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. I don't mean to interrupt, but Will, can I have a word with you? Please? It will only take a minute. All right, yeah, sure. Gentlemen, would you excuse me? I need to tell you about Seattle. There's nothing to tell. I really have to get back to them. I just want you to know that what Andy told you about us... Can we do this later, please? I have to get back to my investors. Hey, pal. Hey, Will. Can I talk with you for a minute? Yeah, sure. What's on your mind? Well, here's the thing... Looks like a cobbler... Smells like a cobbler... Tastes like... A cobbler. Hey, where have you two been? Just visiting with a friend. Have you seen Will, by any chance? He hasn't come to see you yet? I think he's upset with me. Honey... Don't worry. Things always have a way of working out. I hope so. "Meet me at the greenhouse"? Close your eyes. Turn around. Maybe now is the time to smell the roses. Maybe it is. It's beautiful. I had to come up with some way to apologize. I never should have expected the worst, especially not from you. - Andy came to talk to me. - He did, did he? I'm sorry I didn't come to you sooner. I was busy making plans. - What kind? - The kind where I bought a farm. That's huge! It was the "Gilson Beauty" that made it happen. Well, I... I have some news of my own. I didn't buy a farm. I did find a storefront where I hope to open my own practice. See, now, that's huge! Looks like we're going to be neighbors. Yeah? So where's this new farm of yours going to be, Will Nash? Right here... But I didn't say it was new. Will, you bought our farm? Well, not all of it. Your parents sold me a parcel. Well, mom always said, things did have a way of working themselves out. Well, not just yet. I was hoping that the sale came with a partner. Partner plus one? Was kind of hoping it was a package deal. So what are we going to call this merger? Gilson-Nash? Nash-Gilson? You choose. I just want to seal the deal.
