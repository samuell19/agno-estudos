Subtitles by explosiveskull In the year 2037, our world is dying. Mankind has been struck by an infertility pandemic. Those who suffer childbirth are awarded with a mere 15 seconds of their babies' lives. Before the virus takes them. Anyone who tries this once, never attempts it again. The pain is just too much. While humanity is united in our pain, we are sill divided. The political elite and corporations are now indistinguishable. One company, Biocorp, now rules with an iron fist. Those not connected with or working for Biocorp live in the public sectors. Ghettos where we eke out our lives, waiting for extinction while Biocorp and their employees enjoy the final luxuries life has to offer. Trapped in the border walls, and determined to find a way to escape our dystopian country, my friend Thomas and I used our scientific knowledge to build a prototype teleportation device. Only we soon discovered it didn't send matter to another point in space, but another point in time. 20 years into the past, we soon realized that we could travel back in time to 2017. When Biocorp was still in its infancy. And stop them from launching their biometric chip that led to the infertility pandemic that has doomed our species. But Biocorp realized this, too. And sent their troops back after us. And our loved ones. My wife Jenny managed to make it back to warn us, but, my sister, Thomas' one true love, was executed by them. One of their soldiers has made it back too, and is determined to kill us by any means necessary. Now trapped in 2017, we are running out of time until Biocorp discovers how to replicate our time machines and send more troops back. Grief-stricken, Thomas will now stop at nothing to destroy the company. Even if it means killing innocent people. I won't abandon my humanity, 'cause I believe doing so will make us as evil as those we seek to stop. One way or another, we will stop them. The only question now, is: how many people will die to make this happen? What are you typing? I'm taking notes on her brain activity, her heart rate, her temperature and her blood pressure. Just to make sure there's no significant changes. I trust all you gentlemen are paying attention here, please. We're getting it all down, sir. So, if this all works, I decided not to execute you. And instead have you work for Biocorp, but, I wouldn't be doing this if it weren't. You could think about it, but it's easy, really. Live, and work for Biocorp, or die. The deal we had... Deal's changed, keep up. What are you planning to do with it? You could destroy everything by meddling with the past. I didn't create it. Those were your meddlesome friends. You think they had lofty motives? I'm sure they're creating havoc already. No, they, stumbled on it by accident. Oh, yes! This is clearly all an accident. No, it's true, they didn't want any of this to happen. Well, be that as it may, I will use it to go back and change things for the better. Tampering with the past could threaten our very existence. Look, I will do everything you want, but she has to live. Why would you risk your life for her? 'Cause that's just what friends do for one another. Friends? The word friend has no true meaning here. We are creatures of want and need. Those you call friends merely satisfy you. Think you're confused. Just put the gun down and we can talk. Tell me about Biocorp. I don't know anything about that. You're lying! It's all your fault! You're probably one of her, you started the whole thing, didn't you? You tried it on your child, didn't you? You're crazy, you're crazy! Do you think you're better than us? I am crazy, but you're a genocidal stain! You're a genocidal stain! Listen to me, listen to me. If you even come close to making Biocorp succeed or support them, I swear I'll kill you. Do you understand? Say you understand! I understand. All right, enough time, do it now. No, it's not time. Do it now! Look at her brain activity! I don't care! Do what I say. Her brainwave patterns say she's not asleep yet, if you wake her up now, it'll kill her. I think you two are up to something. You told me to run the machine properly! To do that, she has to be in stasis. And now I'm telling you to bring her back! What is the point of knowing how it works if you won't let me show you how it works? That's insane! Do it now. I will not kill her. You're not looking to kill, you're buying time. Step aside, we're finished. What do you want me to do with him? Kill him. I won't have people barking orders at me like I'm one of their pets. How will you figure the exact way to bring someone back? Try on our own. Jenny! I missed you. It's done. What's happened to you? Jenny, my god! Is Lauren with you? No, she. What happened, Jenny? They shot her. - They shot her! - Who... Who do you think, Biocorp! The Speaker. What the hell happened to her? I can't explain, now. Biocorp is at the apartment, and they're gonna pull me back in six minutes. Sir, I think we should let him finish showing the scientists, he may be the only one left who really knows the machine. He and that girl are plotting against us right now in the past. They had no time to plan that. You and I, commander, were alive in 2017. She could be hovering over our young bodies, planning to kill us in our sleep. I hope she is. You see? You're all the same. Power-hungry men without a brain among you. And you're all the same. So fierce in your convictions. As though they might save you. With all due respect, sir, I think we should let the brain activity go to stasis like he says. Very well. Nico, look, I love you and I miss you, but you have to let me go. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna lose you! I don't wanna go, either, but you have to knock me out. No, but, I don't know what you're talking about. They're gonna wake me in five minutes. No, no, David's not gonna do that unless it's safe... David has a gun to his head - before I left - I'm not gonna - lose you again! - We have no other choice! Please, you have to let me go. Just put me under. Prepare the adrenaline syringe. Let's get this process going. You, you can't kill her! I told you, you're finished. Wait! If you let her live, I will help you! I will tell you everything about the machine, I will work for Biocorp like you wanted. With my help, you could use this device to take over the world. There are secrets about this machine that I will tell you only if you let her live. Really? All right. Except, you will tell us these secrets now. Or I guarantee you, I will let her die. Why can't I just stay here with you? No, no, no, no, no, you can't, you can't. Why? You can't, because. 'Cause if you're asleep there and, you might die! I don't care! I wanna be with you. I wanna be with the man that I love. I love you. I'm so sorry about Lauren. It's not your fault, it's not your fault. It's okay, it's. David, he risked his life for her. It's not your fault. They just, they killed her in cold blood. It's okay, just stay here with me. Stay with me, okay? Just be with me. I am. I am. Please, just, just let her fall asleep, you know this'll kill her. What are these secrets? Wake her up properly, first. We know the machine works. We have enough information to carry on without you, or without her. What are the secrets? You do this, I'll never tell. You've got nothing. The adrenaline. Wait. Tell me the secrets. I will when you, wait, wait, wait! Without me, you will fail! Back, back! Back, back! Get back! Go farther! Shots fired! Move, move, move! No, no, no! No, no! She'll live. In a better future. No, no! How could you let this happen! You all right? I remember this headache, it's okay. Are, are they trying to wake me? They disconnected you, honey. How? Must've had no choice. You're here now. Can't go back. I don't care, I just wanna be here with you. I know, I know. It's okay. We need to find Thomas, babe. She loved him, you know that, don't you? She loved you. Move in, now, check your corners! Oh, thank heavens! Like usual, you're just in time! Get me a new team, and get rid of these bodies! Yes, sir. What now? What now? I don't know! But thanks to you, we do know how to go one way! Hello? Hello, is this Mrs. Kyla Torres? Yes, speaking. Mrs. Torres, this is Dr. Raymond Prentice at the New Jersey Fertility Center. Yes, hello Doctor, how you doing? Very well, thank you for asking. I'm calling in regards to the recent tests that you've undergone here at the hospital. Yes, yes, Doctor. How'd they come out? Well, Mrs. Torres, I'm sorry to have to tell you this. There's really no easy way of saying it, but, all of the tests have come back and they're fairly conclusive. In fact, they are 100% conclusive. I'm afraid you are completely infertile. Beyond adoption or surrogacy, I'm afraid you will never have children. Mrs. Torres, are you there? Mrs. Torres? You and our future share something in common. Infertility. Oh my god. He was right. He was right! Hey, Thomas. Thomas! You crazy? Put the gun down! We're committed here, Nico. Right? We came here with a job to do, and now we have to finish it. Right, but, put the gun down. What, did you lose your mind? Where's Jenny? She's uh. She's in the motel. How is she still here? David, is uh, he did what he had to do. She's here with us now. Lucky me. Always the third wheel. It's gonna be okay, bud. I feel so alone, Nico. In a way I thought I'd never feel. We're in this together. I know. We're gonna find a way home. What are we going home to? The future. The future, buddy. We've got the future. The future. The future! You have your future! You have Jenny, you have everything! Lauren is gone! The future without Lauren? For me? There is nothing left to see. - I understand, but... - No! No, no you don't. No you don't! I get that you loved her. I get that she's your sister. I really do, Nico, I really do. But you did not love her like I did. That is not my fault! - That is not my fault! - Yes it is! Because you allowed this to happen. We left them when we shouldn't have. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. - I'm so sorry. - Okay. It's all right. I'm not blaming you. I know exactly, exactly where the blame lies. We need to get our heads straight, okay? We're in danger. What danger are we in? Jenny told me everything. They got the machine, they're sending people back. They're gonna be quick, they're gonna be brutal. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, Nico. Here, Biocorp aren't the bully. Here, we're the killers. Biocorp, they're just babies. We're not killers. We're not killers! Yes we are, Nico. We've killed. How many people have we killed? So many I don't even remember. And we need to kill a few more. We need to, we need to kill just a few more. We need to kill every employee, every colleague, every investor, every friend, every mother, every child of anything to do with Biocorp. We have to leave nobody standing. We didn't move here to kill children. Thomas. If we leave Biocorp standing, Nico, that's exactly what we do. The global biological clock is ticking against us. At this time. Almost as if I'd wrote it myself. I can't believe everyone thinks that's the real John Williams. Well I'm not interested in being famous, I just wanna fix this big mess here. Kyla. You again! Me again. I just want you to know, I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything wrong! Kyla! I'm not here about that today. Okay, well, I took your warning very seriously, and it's been all I can think about, - and I even went to... - Kyla, Kyla! What? I'm here to ask for a favor. What? I need you to help me with access to the Biocorp internal network. No, I can't do it, I've oh my god. Shut up. Shut up, Kyla. - Calm down. - Stop talking. I need the names and addresses of every Biocorp employee. What? Why do you need that? Stop talking and start listening! Okay, okay. Because the more you talk, the angrier I get. The angrier I get, the more I remember. You killed a whole load of my friends! And then I just wanna blow your brains out. Okay, okay, okay. We can access it from my house. Okay? We can do that. We can do that at my house. Okay? - Okay? - Is this your car? Yes, yes it's right here, yeah. Then let's go. Okay. After you. You know, you really don't need that. Actually, I do. Because I don't trust anybody or anything. I told you that you can trust me. After seeing what you've become in the future. Right, I'll pass. So what? No faith that humans can change for the better? Not really. What happened to you? What made you so goddamn cynical? Oh nothing big. Just all my friends and all my family died. Everybody I've ever known is gonna die. And the woman I love, I left to die. I saw society tear itself apart for an idea. It was supposed to save us. All from your company. But that's not my fault! Actually it is. But you can change that. Put all the information on this. Whatever you want. Okay. This is everything. Done! Well done, Kyla. What you're doing is saving lives. Starting with your own. Don't forget what I said. Don't do anything stupid. I promise. We'll see. God, give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change and the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. Oh my god! - Commander. - Sir. Report. We've completed repairs on the machine, and after reviewing David's notes, I think we're ready to successfully send back a volunteer. Well done. Hm. Hm. You may proceed. I'll inform the President. Yes, sir. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'll be okay. She died trying to save your life. She never gave up. Not until the end. So stubborn. She kinda reminds me of someone. I know he loved her. My father loved her so much more than me. I was pretty much invisible to him. Think that's why I hated her. Growing up. Well that, and she used to steal my toys. Well you got over that eventually, right? Yeah. Yeah I did. You know, for the longest time, she was, she was my only friend. And you meant the world to her. God, it's my fault! No, it's not! I shouldn't have left, Jenny. You had to! No, I had a choice! We should go. No, no, no, just. Look, I knew they were gonna raid the apartment. I felt it in my gut, and you know what, I still took the chance on it. And I left you guys alone. Her and, I don't. We went on this stupid mission to save the world, and, it just made everything worse. No, you did what you had to do. A lot of people have had to die. A lot. Babe, you are a good man. You've always been a good man. How do you know? Because I am married to you, and I see it day in and day out. And, if what I say isn't enough to convince you, just know that, the doctor told me that you are too. He made it? Yeah. It was in our time. He helped us. I didn't think he'd remember after all this time. How could he forget, you saved his father's life. That was Thomas. No, it was both of you. He hadn't seen you in 20 years, and he still gave his last moments to you. Doesn't that speak volumes? Yeah, but. You know just, it's just been hard. A lot of people have had to die so we can save lives. I know. It's been hard for all of us. - And Thomas, he's... - Thomas. He doesn't have anyone. He never really did. I don't know what he's gonna do. It's Thomas we're talking about. Hello! Hi! What is it that you have, there? It's my ladybug. Oh, it's a big one. It's the biggest I've ever seen. It's pretty. I'm gonna take it home as a pet. Oh, that's nice of you. My brother's gonna hate it! He doesn't like creepy crawly things. Your brother? I bet he's nice to you. Not when he's sleepy. Do you wanna hold it? Who, me? Yes, you, silly! Okay! Wow! She's pretty like you. Can I have it back now? Yeah, sure. I have to go feed him. You know lettuce is good for ladybugs. How do you know? How do I know? I used to have a ladybug as a pet. Really? Yeah. My sister used to bring them home to me when I was a little boy. That's what I do! Sweetie! Time to go! I have to go now. Bye! Okay, bye-bye. What's for dinner? Oh my god, okay. So are you trying to give me a heart attack? Perhaps. What do you want now? What? I can see why you're a childless skellum. Why because I can't cook? No because you don't deserve one. What? Wait? Wait did something happen? Oh yes. Things have changed Kyla. I gave you everything you wanted. - I gave it to you all, - Not quite. I gave it to you. Not quite. You left out a vital piece of information. And I'm not sure why. I don't know what you're talking, okay. I asked you for a list of every single Biocorp employee. Okay, okay. And what did you give me? Everybody in the US. Wait, I'm... Why would you do that? Because I just wasn't thinking clearly, and you're always holding a gun to my head and you didn't ask me exactly what you wanted! Okay, okay, okay. Well I need everybody. Okay, we'll. So do you understand what I want? Okay, yes, yes! Then get it for me, Kyla. Okay, I can do that. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Did I ever tell you, Kyla, that you really remind me of somebody I once knew? She had beautiful eyes just like you. Smile that could light up a room. But she's not here anymore. Because of you people. Okay. Okay. Okay. How long, Kyla? Okay, it's coming. It's coming right now. Okay, just give me one, just give me. Okay, okay. It's coming out, okay. Okay. Okay. These are all of the Biocorp employees in the world. Tokyo, London, and Paris, you have everything now, it's in your hands. That's it, I gave you everything you wanted. That's it. There's nobody missing from this list? No, I promise, this is it. I promise. I believe you. You wouldn't lie to me, would you? No, no, no! I told you, I told you! I told you, you can trust me! I'm sorry, Kyla, I just can't take the risk anymore. Commander. Our volunteer's ready to go, sir. There's a change of plans. Sir? The President demanded that we no longer waste time. He instructed me to send my best soldier to hunt down and kill these three traitors if they are still alive. I'll complete this mission for Biocorp personally, sir. Commander, I am counting on it. You're dismissed, get out. So I believe he shot that girl because he knew she would be disconnected and safe in 2017. I agree. I think they must all still be alive. You must find them. And then? Yes, sir. Son, is it ready? Yes, sir. Well give it to him! Thank you. What's this? Assuming they did what they're supposed to do, this will allow you to locate every member of the Biocorp family. Chip locator. Let's see. Working perfectly, sir. Working perfectly, sir. Commander, we are pulling you back in 24 hours. If you don't accomplish your mission by then, don't bother to put yourself to sleep. Understand? Understood. Good luck. Let's start this process, please? Thomas? Hello? Please call me back, 'kay? We've been calling you for hours. All right, please, call me. I hope he's okay. Maybe he just needs time alone, you know, after everything that happened. Well I didn't go run and hide. Son of a bitch. Nico! Everyone mourns differently. Yeah, but he could've at least called me. Where the hell have you been? I've been taking care of things. That need to be taken care of. And I got a little drunk on the way. Where did you go? I killed Kyla. Who? An infertile Biocorp employee. - Thomas, you can't just... - Why not? She had information we needed. Now I have it. Yeah, but she understood. What about second chances? There's no second chances anymore, Nico. What's this, huh? That's the name, address, and next-of-kin of every Biocorp employee in the whole wide world. How many people are on this list? - 1,980. - Dear god. Thomas, there's no way we're gonna convince that many people of anything. I'm not trying to talk anybody into anything anymore. What do you mean? What he means, Jenny, he's talking about killing all these people. What? What are you, a mass murderer, now? Is that it? You know what? I haven't been here long enough to hear you two guys' plan. But if it's any better than mine, I'm all ears. Well you know, any plan is better than killing 2,000 people, Thomas! Those people on that list, they deserve to die. They don't deserve to be. Are you kidding me? Have you forgotten what they did to us? What they will do. What? They haven't done anything yet, Thomas. But they will! So what, you're the judge, the jury, and the executioner, now? Is that what you are? - Judging me, again? - Yeah. Talking down to me, because I've got slightly more blood on my hands than you do? No, I've never quite been able to get up to that Nico standard as usual, - no. - I have never. - I have never... - No, no, I won't let you down, I'm not good enough for you, I've never been good enough for you. - I have never done that! - And I've never been good enough for your sister, either! You keep her out of this. What a surprise. We're not gonna talk about her. Both of you just stop! Listen, Thomas, we don't have the time or the resources to reach out to all these people in the globe. Then we wait for a time when everyone on that list is in the same place at the same time, which isn't as hard as you might think. Don't you worry, buddy, I got it covered. You need to stop drinking. Give me that drink, it's enough. I have had not nearly enough to drink! And that is still a good plan! What about this butterfly effect you always talk about, huh? That's 2,000 people. I don't know. That's a lot bigger than - what you're talking about! - I don't know! But isn't it worth trying? Just think about it, guys. Please, for a minute, think about it. If everybody on that list goes, Biocorp is gone. It doesn't exist. Our home is safe, we can go home and we can toast to a world without genocidal criminals on our doorsteps! You're calling them genocidal? Absolutely. Then what does that make you? A goddamn hero. Goddamn hero. The names on this list, all the information is enough to save the whole world, all we have to do is execute it. That's it. Please. Look, I am not killing 2,000 people, Thomas! But it will save six billion so what does it matter? What is there to think about? What is there, it's a no-brainer! It's a coward's solution! It's simple statistics, Nico! You need to sober up. It'll save Lauren. It would save Lauren, do you get that! Did you hear the professor said? We cannot change the past! I'm not trying to change the past, I'm trying to fix our future! That's this future, Thomas! What we experienced was the future, okay? What happened, happened. No, no, 'cause we're here, we're changing things all the time! - Yes, but... - Every minute! I know we're changing things, we're changing the future, not the past! You don't know for sure, do you? You don't know that. You won't even try? And you? Then I'll do it alone. I'll save her. - I'll save us all. - So smart. - Don't worry, I won't need - You're really smart. - Any of your help. - You know that, Thomas? - Thomas! - You're so smart! What! We all lost her. All of us. Yeah, but you know what? We've got a chance to save her. And he chooses not to. Look at him standing there, staring at me, looking at me like I'm the coward. - Huh, what? - Stop, stop! Stop it! She wouldn't want you to do this! Get away from me! Stop it, you're both best friends! Did you forget about that? Yeah, I forgot. You know what else, Jen? Doesn't really matter what Lauren would've wanted. She's not here anymore. Is she? It's gonna be okay. He needs to sober up, right? I don't know, I don't know. We're losing him. I think we already lost him. You know what, babe? You know what the sad thing is? I, I can't even say he's wrong. Maybe we can't save the world. Maybe it's not a possibility. We just have to save as many as we can. I already lost my sister. And now this. No, no. He's the one that we have to save. Don't give up on him. He's talking out of love. They told me you were still here. Where else would I be? What is it? What's wrong, is it the rebels? I was thinking about Jack. - Jack? - Yeah. You know it's been like 20 years now, you realize that? I know he meant a lot to you. And yet you never talk about him. I think about him a lot more often than you realize. Well you think these men, these ones who traveled from the past, you think they killed him? I think it makes perfect sense. I've seen that look in your eye before. Think before you act. You know somethin'? The last thing in the world I need right now is a lecture from you about how I'm supposed to act, and what I'm supposed to do. Because I already did everything I could, they way you wanted. What I want? I see you don't want a child. You want us to die out. I abused my power. I trifled with my power. I did everything I could in my power to get what you wanted. You're right. I'm just, I'm just trying to help you do what's best for all of us, and part of that is what's best for you and me. I'm trying. We did this once before. You almost died. Forgot about that. Let's not. I wanna have a child. Of course I do. I just don't wanna lose you in the process. Okay? Hmph. Excellent. This'll be the easiest hunt of my life. Today, Nobel Peace Prize-winning Biocorp made history by administering the cure for cancer available to the entire world's population in exchange for their voluntary enrollment, compulsory enrollment in the ID chip program. Which allows for increased populations, security. Biocorp's CEO stated, "In time, we understand "that the only thing worth fighting for is family, "and today is a day when we must decide to fight "for what's right, or roll over and die." That's all for tonight. We're all clear. Thank you. Come here, babe. Was it a good news day? I don't know, baby. We're gonna have to wait and find out. What's going to happen now? I don't know. But things are going to change. - Mrs. Adams. - Yes? I'm David Johnson from Biocorp. Both of you come with me. Now! Okay, come on. Yeah, babe. See, Thomas has the list, so we can't warn everyone ahead of time. He's not gonna go through the entire list. Plus, the police would catch him here in this time. What's that? Why is this going off? Is that your tracker? Yeah, David programmed it for me. Oh. Well we can use this to find Thomas! No, someone else is here. Babe, that's Thomas right there. No, there's a fourth signal. Maybe it's David. No, you and I know that's unlikely. Well if it's not David, it's not friendly. And whoever it is, they are moving fast. We need to get outta here, then. Wherever we go, they're gonna track us. All right, let me think, okay? All right, so, Thomas said that everyone on that list, that they're from all over the globe. So uh... So you think he's gonna fly everywhere? No, it's too slow. I know! What? If you don't have a way to go to everyone. You bring everyone to you. Exactly, he's trying to attack everyone at the same time. I have an idea. What? David, he put an AI on my tracker. Good boy, David! We can have the AI, it'll link over to the computer system, maybe we can have internet in this time. Okay, moment of truth. Computer, do you have internet access? Yes, of course. What would you like to see? Adam, pull the database for any upcoming Biocorp events. I have access to a public calendar for Biocorp. There is a staff gala this Friday, would you like the details? Yes. Bingo! There it is, everybody on the list. We gotta move. You know it's a good thing I went back and you stayed. I never could have built that thing. You're very versatile, you know that? Having doubts? Hey, I get it. I mean, of course you are, you're not some kind of psychopath. If you weren't having doubts, then I'd be worried about ya. This is a serious move, my friend. I mean, not like what you've already been doing isn't, but this? This is the next step. This is where you've been heading all along. And it's been a dark road the whole way. Have you thought about how many people are gonna be there tonight? I mean, really thought about it? People with families, with children. 2,000 people with hopes and dreams, and you're gonna turn them all into corpses in the span of a second. You know what 2,000 people is Thomas? - Shut up. - Do you? It's 0.0022% of how many are gonna get killed in the riots of 2021. It's 0.000029% of the population of this world, all of whose futures are being determined here. Now. By you. So you push that button and don't even pretend you've gotta think about it. I mean, hey, let's not kid ourselves. What you're doin' is a horrible thing. You're already a murderer, buddy, but this? This makes you a butcher. What you do tonight, will haunt your dreams. For the rest of your life. Stop. So really at this point, there's only one thing you gotta ask yourself: how much is your sleep really worth? One horrifying act, for the future of all mankind. And for her. I guess if he's talking from your head, that makes me your heart. You can't escape your fate. Maybe it's our time to bow out. Everything and everyone has it's time. The only tragedy is, we missed ours. I'm going to see you again, my love. And when I do, I wanna recognize your face. Don't save me and lose yourself. Yeah, yeah I'm on my way from work right now, actually. - Yeah I know... - Excuse me, officer. Uh, hey, yeah man, what's going on? Could you tell me where Collie Avenue is? - Collie Avenue? - Yeah. Yeah, actually if you head over... Love these old antiques. - I need you to hear me out. - What? We need to stop Thomas? I, I, I know that. No, no, no, we need to do whatever it takes. What do you mean, whatever it takes? We can't let him kill all those people! I know, but I'm not gonna kill Thomas! Okay, I'm not playing this kill or be killed game. So what, you're gonna try to talk him down off the ledge? I mean have you seen him? Yeah, I saw him, baby. Just, just, you know what, just stop. Let me just talk to him first, okay. Talk to him, Nico, you are not the one he wants to talk to. All right, you're right. All right. Last chance to change your mind. I don't wanna change my mind. Bye! Well, I guess we're really gonna do this thing. Yeah, it looks that way. Is he going to work? Yeah. Workin' hard for his family. Reminds me of someone I know. Still never fixed it. Sorry, sis. Who the hell are you! - Where are you - No, listen! Taking my baby! Mom, mom, mom, listen! - Help! - Mom! - Somebody help me! - Mom! Mom, mom, look, okay! Look, I'm your son! I know it's hard to believe, it's me, Nico! Look I broke my arm in the basement working with Jimmy Finkle, okay? I used to eat ice cream in a special bowl with bananas, do you remember, when I was four, okay? We don't have much time. Okay. Listen, I'm gonna let you go. Mom, but you cannot scream, you understand? Do you promise? Okay. Who are you people? You look so much like, uh... I know, I need you to focus, okay? Okay, look, I'm your son. I'm all grown up, this, this is my wife. Jenny, we're from the future. Hi. We're here to save Lauren. What? Something horrible happened to her in the future. Okay, we have a chance to save her. If you let her come with me. It's not possible! Yes, listen, you have to believe me. Listen, she deserves to live a good, full life. What, what happened to her? If you help us, she'll grow up to be a beautiful woman. Marry the man of her dreams, have kids, have a family, but if you don't, she's gonna die! I don't understand! You are at school, and now you are so old! It's been a long time. My son? My son? Even if I believe you, how can I let you take my little girl? We're here to save Lauren. We're here to save Lauren, okay? Nico, we have to go. Okay, listen mom, Lauren's gonna be safe, okay? I need you to cherish your life with your husband and your son. What do you do to her? Do you drug her? Listen, mom, I gave her something to sleep. Okay, I just gave her something to sleep. I can't let her go, no! Listen to me. She is my best friend in our time. She looks just like you, your eyes and everything. Nico! All right, look, okay, you gotta promise me you can't tell dad. He will not understand if you tell him. This is too much, this is not happening. This is a lot of information. I cannot even process all what's happening now. Don't you feel it, that he's your son? I know this is real. And I can feel that you are my son, but. Yes, take care of her. I will. Nico, we have to go! I know, but babe, just give me a minute. Please hurry. I will, I promise. Take her to the car. Take care of her. You grow up to be a fine-looking man. And your wife, she's so beautiful. Yeah, she is beautiful. I was wrong, I was wrong. Mom, I have to tell you something. Where I'm from, you're not in the future with me. But I'm here now, I'm with you. I'll always be with you. I'm your mother! Listen, you really were the best mother in the entire world. The best mother! You always say that to me. Guess you really were always more beautiful. Mom, you can come with me. You can take care of Lauren with me. Wait, who will be your mother, here and now? Who's gonna take care of you, who's gonna be there when you fall? I cannot be there. I can't leave him! I have to stay here with you and your father. I heard that there are women outside the city who are still fertile. They have a natural immunity to the virus that those inside the city don't. I have to go now. Mom? No, mom, no! No, mom! Are you hit? No, my mom, she's... Nico, you have to leave her! Stand up, you have to run, leave her! I don't normally do house calls, but who's first? She is, doc. How close? We have time. Doc, can you do this fast? I have no choice, let me see. All right, this will numb the area, okay? Yeah, okay, that sounds like a good idea. It'll be fine. Okay. Don't look, don't look, babe. All right, it's okay, babe, it's okay. Okay, all right. It's okay, babe. All right, don't look, don't look, don't look. You're fine, you're just fine. Well come on, come on! Let's go, let's go! Never seen it. It looks so ordinary. We don't have time for sightseeing, doc. Yes, of course. All right. It worked! Wait, he's getting closer. Stitch up quick, then, stitch up quick. Here's a bandage, okay. Your turn. Forget about it, doc, just forget about it! If you flinch, I could sever a blood vessel or a tendon! Look, I'm not gonna flinch, just do it! Okay, hold him still. Come on, let's go! Do not move! Nico, don't move. Son of a Almost there. And he's almost here! Where is the chip? It's in really deep. Baby, go! Go check on Lauren in the car! What? Go in the car, check on Lauren, do it! Son of a bitch! Almost there, okay, almost there. Come on, doc, come on, doc! I got it, got it. I need to patch you up! No time! You okay? What? You were just having a dream. - What? - A dream. Oh. I had a nightmare. What, about the kid? Sort of. What do you mean, sort of? Well it started off that way, and then Thomas showed up, and the kid, he... And it ended the way it always does. Yeah. Maybe he wants to hurt her. No, he doesn't. Yes he, does. - He doesn't, he doesn't. - He wants to hurt her. And we gotta get her somewhere safe. She is safe, it was just a nightmare. We gotta protect her. We will. From Thomas. Thomas would never do anything to hurt her. You know that. I'm afraid I don't, babe. Dammit. Still got you. Ow. Still alive? Yeah, still ticking. Hi! And who is this little person at my door? What's your name, young lady? My name's Lauren, do you have any apple juice, please? Come on in, we'll see what we can do for you. Thank you! Come on, I'll take you. Ow. Still sore? Yeah, it's sore. Got you set up. Please. Well you managed not to wreck your arm completely. Not that he didn't try. So who is your little friend? That's my sister. If you don't mind me asking, where are you? My younger self, I'm at home with my father. What about your mother? Things are getting more and more complicated. Yeah, you have no idea. What, what's the big secret? In the future, where I come from, you saved my life. His, too. It's true. How'd I do that? We reconnect. But, I shouldn't tell you too much about your own life. Well I'm glad to know I'm still around, then. Anyway, I just wanted to thank you. You are one of the bravest people that I ever meet. It's the least I could do for the man who saved my father's life. Dad? Oh, come here, son! We have some guests. You never told me you had a son. I mean why else do I have all these juice boxes? This is Travis, Travis these are my friends. Hello, Travis. I'm Nicholai, you can call me Nico. Go and play with Lauren, okay? Huh? She's staying here for the day. Go ahead. His mother passed away two years ago in an accident. He's all that I have left of her. Thanks to you, we have more time. Years, perhaps. And for that, I am ever grateful. So he's doing well? He's healthy. And he has a positive outlook on life. And knowing that I have 30 years, he'll probably still outlive me. And poor Travis' step-brother. It's a good thing, though. Spending time with family is important. Yes it is. And Travis is a full-time job. Something wrong? No. Sure, babe? Mhm, yeah. Thomas has one of these trackers, too, as I recall. So where is he? He's, he's changed. We think that he's planning something. Something terrible. Something like what? Can't tell you right now. Well whatever it is, let me know if I can help. Actually, I do need your help, doc. No. I need you to watch her for me. Of course! See, something, something bad happens to her in the future. And we're trying to prevent that. Is that what changes Thomas? Hm? He spoke of Lauren in his time. Yeah, I guess. Look, I'll watch over her like she's one of my own. Are you sure? We don't wanna inconvenience you. Baby, it's just for now. I don't wanna pile anything extra on him, we should just take her, and. Look, I understand. If you don't stop Thomas from whatever it is, it'll only make matters worse. That's just it. Gotta get going. Is that Thomas? It's hard to say. There's two signals and they're getting closer to each other, we have to go now. Wait, wait, Nico. Good luck, okay? And don't worry about her, she's in good hands. Thanks, doc. Let's go, babe. Hey, what was that about? What? You looked like you saw a ghost. He gave his life for you. I wasn't sure if I should say anything. No, but. His son Travis. He doesn't turn out quite so well. It's nothing. Hey, hey, you sure? Yeah. Just caught off guard. Let's go. All right. Wish I could go back and destroy that machine. Babe, none of this is your fault. You know that, right? I wouldn't have built the machine, none of this would've happened. You gave people a fighting chance, it's something that they never had before. They're gonna keep sending people back after us. Don't you get it? What are you saying? So what I'm saying is we need to get home now, more than ever. Gotta rebuild the machine. Then you'll rebuild it. I can't do it without Thomas. Then we'll convince Thomas. After we stop him from killing everyone. All right. Wait, wait, stop. We can't, we can't, no, babe! Okay, okay, everything's gonna be okay. Nico, call an ambulance! My baby! What's your name, what's your name? - Carmen. - Carmen, okay. I need you to breathe, Carmen, okay, stay with me. I'm not gonna leave you. You're not gonna be alone, just, relax, okay? Okay, the ambulance is coming. Babe, you know we can't stay. Nico, I'm not leaving her, I can't. You know why. I know, but we have to go. No, you need to go. Just go without me. I'll be fine, Thomas. I'll be right behind you. I promise. I'm meant to be here. - Okay, okay. - I love you. Okay, okay, Carmen, I need you to breathe, okay? What's your baby's name? - Cadence. - Cadence, baby Cadence, right? You know how lucky you are? Do, do you have any children of your own? Not yet. One day. One day. One day. Hey, how you doing? Good, and you? Good, good, you going to the Biocorp ball tonight? Yeah, of course. You got an invite? I got it right here. Okay, so I need that and your clothes. Good one, Arnie. Get out of the car. Give me the invite. Come on. Take your jacket off. You work for Biocorp? Yeah. You really shouldn't. Come on, come on, come on. We didn't find any downside. From all the research that we've done, sir, we have had absolutely nothing going wrong, but what I'm talking about is we need to make extra sure before we go in front of the FDA or any other approval board... Senator, so sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to shake your hand. Hello. Hello. And Robert. I didn't expect to see you again so soon. What a bonus that you're here. Yeah, it's good to see you, too. Enjoy the party. There's a possible intruder in the maintenance area. Sir, this area is off limits! I'm sorry? I said sir, this area is off limits. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm not from here. I was just looking for a place for a cheeky cigarette. Sir, you're gonna have to come with me. Yes, of course, please. Sir, this area is off limits. Oh, yes, I'm sorry, gentlemen, I was looking for the bathroom. It's just off the main entrance, it's this way. It is? Why don't we just go straight there? We'll escort you. Please, lead the way. Can I see your invitation, please? Yes, of course. I put it right here. Can I help you, sir? Hi. I'm here for the Biocorp event. Sir, the main entrance is around to the front. Oh, I'm with a special group within the company that's here to put on a special surprise tonight. Well do you have a regular invitation, sir? No. Then I'm afraid I can't let you in at all. Well I'm afraid that I outrank you in every conceivable way. And I am coming in. Sir, please leave the premises immediately. Or what? Or I'll have you arrested for trespassing. Well I guess you better arrest me. Give me one big push, all right? I can't do it, I can't do it! You're doing good, okay? Look at me, you're doing a great job. - I can't! - One big push, okay? It's there, I see it. Come on, there you go. Nice and big one, come on, let's go. There, yeah, there you go, there you go. There you go, there you go, that's it. - Congratulations. - Baby girl! - Congratulations! - Beautiful baby girl. She's beautiful. She's beautiful. Trust me, I got the better end of this deal. I have to go, good luck, okay? Thank you so much. Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. I missed you. What are you doing, baby? I did what I have to. I came here to save you. No. No. I'm trying to save you. No. This isn't the way. Let me do this. Otherwise I lose you. Do you trust me? Yeah. Do you love me? Yeah. I love you. I've always loved you. Trust me, my love. We'll see each other again. Do not. We warned you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special guest tonight. It's my pleasure to introduce to you, Senator Jim Williams. Thank you. Thank you all. We're uh, not quite sure where Bob Tinker is right now, but if it's all right with you, I'll do the honors. You have had a wonderful and successful year here at Biocorp. Your hard work has made the company as powerful and proficient as it is today. But now, I have had the honor of being one of the prime architects in the establishment of a new government contract with Biocorp. The goal is the new Biocorp will rid the entire world of crime within the next 10 years. Thomas, where are you? Thomas, Thomas, Thomas! Oh Thomas, thank god, it's you. What are you doing? What am I doing? We're here to stop you from doing something horrible. How do you know about that? Thomas! We're not idiots, we figured it out! You probably figured out you can't stop it either, Nico! Nothing can stop it now. In the name of god, Nico, why would you wanna stop it, huh? Look at these people! They're murderers, mass murderers, every single one of them! No, no, they're innocent. Lauren was innocent! Look, Lauren wouldn't want you to be doing this! Yes she would, Nico! She'd want me to kill a few to save a billion, you know she would! Do you want that on your conscience? Do you? It's bigger than us. I know it's bigger than me and you. Okay, so just, just go. Let me do this, go! Go! And what are you gonna do, huh? It's a bomb, isn't it. It doesn't matter what it is! It's a bomb, isn't it! Yes! Oh my god. Thomas, I've got Lauren. - No, stop, stop. - We can fix this! Thomas look at me, look at me! She's with a doctor, we can fix this! No, as a baby, right? You went and got her as a baby! Nico, it's not the same! Nothing is gonna change my mind. - Please come. - No. You gotta go. For me, please, go. Okay, all right. If you kill these people, then you kill me, too. I'm not leaving without you. Then I'm gonna kill Jenny, too, right? She's in the building somewhere, Nico, right? She's here, right? Somewhere? You're gonna take that risk with her life? Don't waste your time following me. You'll never find that bomb, mate. You haven't got the time. Thomas! Thomas! Oh my god, what do I do? - Was that Thomas? - Yes, that was Thomas. Oh my god, he has a bomb in here. We need to find it! It could be anywhere! The danger, too. What was it, honey? Baby girl. - It was? - She's okay. Okay, that's good, that's real good. Okay, we need to get everyone out. Okay. Everyone, everyone listen up! - Listen to me! - Listen! There's a bomb in the building! We have to leave! Everyone listen to me! There's a bomb! Get outta here! Get outta here! There's a bomb! There's a bomb, get out! Come on, we gotta go! Move, move, move! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Police, don't move! Whoa, whoa, okay, we're okay. Nico! Thomas! What have you done? Are you crazy? What have you done! We had to stop you. Stop me? You didn't stop me, you ruined everything! - Thomas! - Nico! There's still time, Nico, to fix this. Tell me what you did with the bomb. You let her go! I swear to god, I'm gonna kill you, man! You killed everything you love, Nico. You killed me, you killed Jenny, you killed Lauren, you killed every single person we ever loved! And for what? For these people? Look, look, look, I'll figure something out, - just let her go. - No! Nico, this is kill or be killed. Time to man up! Give me the bomb! Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, there's a guy with a gun in there, he's just shot two officers. He's going crazy, he's shootin' everybody! Sir, something's wrong. What do you mean? What's wrong? His brain activity is all wrong. What do you mean, wrong? His heart rate's slowing too! Can't anyone here do anything right? Baby, babe, hang in there! No, no, no, no! You should go. Go! You know they're gonna send more people back, Thomas. You know he's not the end! I need your help. To do what? To fix it? I was trying to fix it, Nico! That's what I was doing! Not that way. Not in that way! We can rebuild the machine. Okay, I just need your help! I need your help, I need you. You can find the cause of the virus before it spreads! The cause of the virus was in that room, and you let them get away! We, we can... We can what? We can wait? For Biocorp to send back another guy to kill us? Or send back a guy to kill our families before we're born! What are we waiting for? We're waiting for nothing, Nico. And don't you worry. I'm gonna fix it, my friend. And I'm gonna ask you for just one more thing. And then we never have to see each other. When I fix it, don't get in my way. There's the one little thing. - No, no, no, no! - We have to stop him, Nico! - No, we can't! - Won't get another chance! Let him go. His brain activity is inactive. His heart rate's flat. Is there any chance that he is still alive in 2017? No, sir. He's uh, he's dead. Prepare the clean sweep protocol. Do we have the authorization? Prep the machines! Yes, sir. This whole thing has spun out of control! How many can we send in? The Speaker says that by hour's end, they will have completed enough chambers to send 50 at a time. 50? Yes, Mr. President. All right, tell him to send four waves, as soon as possible. Four, sir? Are you aware of the concern many have? I'm very well aware of the dangers. I may be causing our own annihilation. But to do nothing, would mean the same thing. How do you feel? Still alive. Thankfully. So now what? Build a time machine, head back home. I still think we need to stop him. He's way beyond our reach, babe. He'll kill too many people before we can assemble a machine or fix anything. We need to stop him, Nico. - Dammit! - What is it? Oh my god. Are there any new waves today? Are they close? No, thank god. Wait, why is it doing this, is it broken? I hope so. Because if it isn't, they just sent a shitload of people back. Think I'm going to like it here. Subtitles by explosiveskull
