Those are all actual mixtapes that people have given us. Why would they give them up? Sometimes people will put their mixtapes in with their boxes of other music stuff, and then, when they sell those boxes, the tapes end up here without a home. It's kind of sad that they lose them. I think that's why my boss started the wall. If there's even a possibility that one of these can get reunited, they stand a much better chance up on the wall than... in a trash can or landfill somewhere. Lost & Found. Mm-hmm. That's clever.

I tried to tell Chloe but she just thought I was losing it, so... You saying that she saw you disappear? And did she say anything about it? No, I tried to have her listen to see if it would send her back, but it didn't work, and when I tried, nothing happened because it was the wrong song, a song I didn't remember. Uh-huh. Nothing happened to me with... I presume, one of the right songs. Well, I guess it seems that it's... it's you. That's what I was thinking. I'm just burning through my chances to save him and I can't buy myself more time because I can't rewind the thing, and I just... just don't know what else to do. Sounds like to me you have to break the pattern. If you want to keep him alive, that's the only way. Well? I didn't say I had all the answers. I thought you said you could fix anything. Well, there's also a chance that maybe you're not meant to save him. What? COOPER: Don't get me wrong. You've been telling me, no matter what you change, he still ends up dying. So... So, so, maybe you should just enjoy the extra time you have with him. Most people only get one shot at being with the person they love. You've been given two. Which is all the more reason why I-- I need to try and save him. Well, y-- y-- you're telling me to give up, and I-- I-- I can't just do that. I can't just sit here with a second chance and just let him die. Wait a minute! I have to try. You, you're bleeding. Laura. Hey, hey. Hey! Shit! What's going on? I-- I don't know.

COOPER: Huh? We need to get her to the ER. That looks pretty deep. Yeah. I'll pull my car up, okay? We'll meet you outside. Harrison... Here, apply some pressure. The, um, article, I read about what happened. Mm-hmm. LAURA: Stay away from Beach Road, okay? Just, um, we go for a walk there on the 25th after a rainstorm, and, uh, there's some downed power lines. Okay, okay. Maybe you need to spend less time with me too. What the hell are you talking about now? I don't know, nothing seems to be working. We have to try it, okay? We're running out of time. If that doesn't keep you alive, we only have two more chances. Okay. Harrison, did she hit her head? (TAPE SQUEALS) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (CRYING) Who wants some 'nanas? (SHRIEKS) I'm so sorry! (DOOR CLOSES) (BABY CRYING) Cooper. Hey. There you are. Where the hell did you go? Never mind. Is he still dead? Ah, a bad car accident on 72, man. His old man couldn't control the car and just hydroplaned. Dr. Knott was driving? Okay, um, that's an easy fix, I can fix that. Um... An easy fix? It sounds like every way in which you try to save him, he still ends up dying. It's like the universe has a plan, and you can't deviate from that plan. Most people only get one shot at being with the person that they love. For whatever reason, you've gotten two. Yeah, we've already been through this. We have? The other you. W... Well, if I came to the same conclusion on two different timelines, then maybe you should consider it. Yeah, okay, um, thanks for your help. (CELL PHONE CHIMES) (CHIMES) CHLOE: Coming. Hi. You know what you pulled earlier was pretty messed up. I have made so much progress this past year, and you just come in here and say all that stuff to me? One of the toughest things about these past four years, Laura, was that... I didn't just lose my brother and my dad. I lost my best friend too. Chloe, I'm... I'm so sorry for not being there. Don't really have an excuse. I'm not looking for an excuse. You know, uh... a few weeks before Harrison's birthday, I tried to break up with him. Tried to convince him to leave. But his mind was made up, he was not changing it. I should have... I should have argued more, I should have fought. I've been trying to figure out how to keep him and save him, but... what if I can't have both? You're doing it again, you're just diving back into all of it. I need to go. CHLOE: What? I need to go. No. Laura, please, can we just talk? I think you need help. LAURA: We'll talk tomorrow! (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (TAPE SQUEALS) Most people just talk about what they want to do and they never do it. (SOULFUL BALLAD PLAYING) It's you? Yeah. It didn't work, and it's not just you this time, your dad is dead too. Wait, what? How? It... How? You guys were going for a drive along the coast and the road was slick from the storm and he lost control, but it's okay, I know how to fix this. You need to leave. How is that gonna fix anything? We just haven't been thinking big enough. HARRISON: What do you mean? We keep addressing the immediate problem, which is how you die, right? Isn't that what we're trying to do here, keep me alive? LAURA: Yeah. But no matter which way you die, it's always... after you should have gone to school, after you decided to stay here with me. So you want me to leave? That's the only way. You won't be here to be killed and you won't be driving with your dad so he'll be saved too. It's the safest bet. Well, what does that mean for you? As long as you're alive, I'll be okay. That's all that matters to me. Promise me you'll do this. You have to break up with me. You really think it's the only way? Nothing else has worked. You know, we had almost the exact same conversation when we were here before. Déjà vu. Yeah. So if I leave... this is it then. Yeah. That'll make this the last song. And if it doesn't work? Are you gonna be okay? I just need to know. Yeah. I'll call you when I get back. Don't change your number, okay? I won't. See you in the future. Okay, I'll see you. (TAPE SQUEALS) (GASPS) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (DIAL TONE RINGING) OPERATOR: We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. (TAPE SQUEALS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (PINS CLATTER) MALE VOICE: Whoo-hoo! Harrison, you promised me. You promised me you'd go. You looked me-- Laura. I looked you right in the eyes when you did, and you lied to me, you straight-up lied to me. No, no. Listen. No, I need you to understand. What's there to understand? You're still dead! I tried, I tried to leave. I tried, okay, but you forgot about you. Th-- the other you, the one that stays when you leave? I'm left with her just staring at me in anticipation, like she-- Like you are waiting, hanging on to the moment, my words. It's like time stops for you. You haven't heard a word that we've said, and I know that you wouldn't understand, and I can't... I can't bear to hurt you like that. But you have to, you have to, Harrison. This is-- It's your life we're talking about, okay? We don't even know if it's gonna make a difference, Laura. We don't even know. The plane might crash, another car might come out of nowhere. We don't know, and I would much rather take my chances here with you. And look, if... if not being able to face death alone makes me selfish, then I'm sorry, but I am selfishly in love with you. ♪ That everyone... I've wasted this. Laura. I've wasted this. Cooper, he tried to-- he tried to warn me, this one chance to be with you, I should have just lived it. I should have... But I-- I-- I wasted it and now it's gone. No, hey, hey. Listen.
