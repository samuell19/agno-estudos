Who's his French contact or whether he makes contact himself. I’m willing to believe he’s suspicious, but… Either he is very good, or you’re really really shik. Because he is a freak, boss. I’ll give you 48 hours to uncover his contact. If this mission proves too hard, I’ll form a new, better team. Okay? Dismissed.. Francois. Yes, boss. Once a week, outings to a call girl’s house.

A friend, my math teacher. He’s super nice and willing to charge me half. In exchange for what? I don’t know. He must be sensitive to the fact that I’ll make an effort. Yeah, sure. What, dad? You haven’t been to school for three weeks. Pacman I imagine you have a good reason. The best let me off. You still have to graduate. No? What for? To end up like you?

Nothing to fear. Are you fucking real?. I would never dare to talk to my father like that. I’d be afraid of his reply. Your grandfather looked like nothing, but in fact was extraordinary. Violent. The first time he slapped me. I deserved it. I had skipped classes for at least three days. The other times? If I didn’t go back to school, I think he would have killed me. Another thing he would not have approved…. is my mother suffering my teenage nonsense. Your mother is more fragile than a mirror. Here! The hot fax. The whole federal. That’s from Julian.

Tell me the news. I heard you came to see me at the library. Just a little hello passing by the neighborhood. Missed by just a little. I had to go see a bookbinder. Because ours increased rates, and we have fewer credits. So I have to find another one. That’s stuff you can’t do over the phone? Ah. no. You have to see the quality of the work before making up your mind. You don’t realize how important it is. The binding is… the lifespan of the book. I forgot the mustard. Diamonds.

When you’re done, put it back in the bag’s bottom. Once you have all the items in place. Verify the video there. Thank you. You were not followed? No. I turned around several times like you taught. No one was there. Because my normal life is my job… Now, what’s your name? You must have been anxious, not hearing from me the last few days. Yes. Where did you disappear? A mission I miraculously survived. And now… I’m back from hell. Worse than Baghdad? Baghdad was a holiday next door. Can you read the intrigue between the lines? What's written hides foreign policy. A truck explodes in a parking lot in Italy. It was you? You recognize my style. What was in the truck? Even on my deathbed, I could not say. You know you can have total confidence in me. It’s funny you’re telling me what I already know. I could think only of one woman… as I jumped with 3 of my men to the target. By parachute? In dark of night. But not a problem worth talking about. How did it go? Rocket launchers… 14 dead. I lost two of men. It could have been worse. What was in the truck? All I can says is that… democracy and world balance were on the brink. Thief! Took my bag. No. Your papers first. That’s right. You’re going to apologize to the lady. I didn’t talk to you. To make sure you’re doing it, I’m keeping your buddy. Go ahead! Fucking shit! My friend screwed up. It’s all there. You can check. Yes. It’s yours. Still want the police? No, no. I guess for you, this seems normal. I’m going back to the library. I’ll see you when I come back… If I come back. Are you leaving now? Secret defense. You’ll read it in your favorite daily. Good-bye How long have you been with us, Francois? 15 years, boss. You didn’t know the monk? He wss a very good guy. Well, one day, I don’t know why. He… got interested in a neighbor. He got a taste for it. Three months later, he wanted to trap the whole world. He’d gone crazy. Don’t worry, boss. My head’s fine. That’s a very good thing. And you know we never sent anyone. I know you keep a clean ship. I’d like to know that for a long time. Carry on. Darling, have a good day? Routine. How about you? Oh. Nothing special. If this isn’t happiness, I don’t know what is. So true. Sometimes, you want to do what you don’t usually. I don’t know about change. Start a new life. What for? For the habits. Like that. We always believe that elsewhere is better. If it’s not so good, come back. Selena… Why don’t you go private? If you’re so bored with me… But don’t you be young again? I’m not that old. Me neither. I don’t want to live like an old lady. What more can I offer you than I have? Nothing. Hello, darling. I’m in Beirut. In a grocery store, very picturesque. An incredible mission. If I come out alive, I’ll tell you. Don’t cry my, flower. This French rooster will defend himself to the death. Honey, I have to hang up. There’s a guy coming up to me. Not sure he’s friendly… There’s a guy coming in half an hour about the Eldorado. It’s going to be hot tonight. In the mean time, go prep the Eledorado. You go too. Doesn't it sing to you? Hello, she says. Hello. Let’s pull the chicks. They will jump for this. To know. To understand. Be entititled to it. We’re off! It’s not a great drive, but that’s not why you get it. No. It’s fully equipped to catch the big game. From box to the sheets. I enjoyed it. I broke in the package. Why get rid of it? I like change in all areas. I catch and release. Can we try the highway? No. Problem. It’s a quest of speed. because old Americans are like young French people. It’s hot! Meanwhile, I have a call to make. Let’s grab a bite to eat. It’s my treat. If you buy cash. Hello, gentlemen. Hello. Telephone? On the right, next to the toilet. I’ll wash my hands. Hello, Chantal. It’s still me. It’s closed like I broke it. I made Qatar. I’ll tell you about it. It’s complicated. I couldn’t stay the morning in Cairo. Can you pick me up from the competition? Art. Forever. Except for you. Two guys already have offers on the Eldorado. You’re a friend. I’ll give you priority. I’d tell my wife, but this kind of car makes them dream. You got it figured out! With chicks, there is no secret. You have to make them dream. You have to get them out of their shitty, everyday life. Look at me for example. I’m not physically attractive.. But No! I understand. A page from the paper, packs your puddings. You have trick? A sure thing. What? Professional secret. 1000 invested. I pretend to travel. and my suburbanite thinks she’s at the end of the world with Indiana Jones. Magic of the word. Did you see that one? Normal. You’d have that if you wanted. But she’s not my style. Find a challenge. My favorite are the, uptight housewifes. The teacher kind without sex with their husbands. I was like a sex tutor. With their husbands, no. All badgers. If they are bad fucks, it is thanks to themselves. Those jerks! Take my Eldorado. Can I try if for three days? Because it’s you… Today, you take care of foreign money. A german. Yes, yes. Wait till you see her. She’s going to land at Orley. Let her come, Frankfurt. Rent a car. An operative places a beacon. She always uses three cars for travel. She’s extremely careful. So, don’t get seen. She’s got to joing Genlis. When that’s done… We intervene. Bring them here for questioning. Have you been listening? Yes. But nothing interesting, you know. News about Simon? Nothing for three days. One’s missing. What do you mean? They’re numbered, moron. They’re 25 to 27. Where’s the 26th? Are you going to fire me? Where is the 26th! Helene, I have a very important service to ask you We have to see each other. But I can’t. It’s a matter of life and death. About? I’m in my hideout now. Come join me. But what happened to you? Serious. I’ll tell you at 1 PM Car 2, Eppe. Car 2. Car 2. Loud and clear. Where is the client’s car? In front of the Rapheal hotel, Kleber Avenue. Ok. Thank you. Over. No, Francois. No. Why not? You’re going to do something stupid. So, I’ll get out and call the boss. It’s not nice to snitch. I’ll throw you too. I’m white as snow. What are you going to throw at me? Selective memory. That spy that you let go for a little pipe. That’s right? I know everything about you. So, you have no choice to the end. Alert, Eppe. Leaving hotel. She is leaving the hotel. Okay. Stay out of visual. Minimum range one kilometer. Message received. I have to be away. I’ll be back in a little. Ah. Simon. The customer stopped a short while in Evry center. She just left. Of course. Continue. Followed? No, I did as you taught me. You have to become my wife. I’m already married. Just a mission to Acapulco. I need to be married. You understand. You’ll play my wife. I can’t do that. I can’t rely on someone else there. On the spot you’ll be fine. You’ll only play my wife for the mission. But it’s impossible. You’re going to experience with me intensity that you can't imagine. Others are the opposite of us. Not children of valor. They'll never believe we're a couple if we haven't consummated. Please, for democracy, for law, for me. Sit down. Sit down. Who do you work for? Evry City. I'm just a librarian. That’s right. And I’m a priest at Saint-Phillipe du roule. I swear before God. What were you doing working hours in a caravan with an international terrorist. He said he works for France. How long have you known him? It’s a completely crazy story. We’ll judge. Start talking. It was about a month ago. I was taking tea in the cafe across the library. Look here. It is a matter of life or death. I’ll give you a call. I’ll tell you about it. Alright? I know I should have told the police. Why didn’t you? I don’t know. He didn’t look dangerous. Yes. I have a boring life. Are you married? Yes. It doesn’t seem very exciting. My husband is a civil servant. I understand. You’re pissing away your life. No Then, you need adventure. Like everyone else. Like all women Perhaps. Tell us about your sexual relations with your husband. Should not be hard to remember. Three days ago. Three days later. It’s me. Do you remember saving my life? The attache. Ah. Yes. Do you still have it? Yes, in my office. I need it urgently. Set a rendevous at the same cafe. Did you open it? A bit. I closed it right away. So you know. Who are you? I’ll tell you . I’m risking my life for France. I just came back from Beirut, but almost didn’t survive. I have to go back. Have you seen him often? Every time he came back from a mission he’d call me. Did you sleep with him? I’m married. You’re not the first one who’s sleeping with an adventurer instead of a civil servant. I swear to God. He doesn’t have any money. How long has it made you want an island? I love him. Sexually speaking, it’s not what it used to be. I don’t want anyone but my husband. You know you could face 10 years in prison. I have to go home because… My mother, my husband and my children are waiting for me. We’re going to put you incommunicado. Let me out of here! Put down the chair. Calm down. There may be a solution. Working for us. But I’m not a spy. It will get you out of your little, monotonous life. I don’t want to change my life. It’s that or prison. I want to go home. For that, you have to agree to work with us. What would that be? For small missions very simple to start. What’s next? We’ll see. You have no choice but to accept. Otherwise, goodbye to your little family life. My husband won’t know? No one should know you work for us. and certainly not him. Since I have no choice? Yes. From now on… You are Jean Fleury. Say what? Your new codename is Jean Fleury. No, It’s Topaz. We’re taking you back. Motherfucker. We’ve been looking for you for years. You did make us drool. Well done. Now it’s over. You’ve mistaken me for someone else. We know all about you, Kevin Stark. International terrorist. But my name’s Simon. I sell rotten crates in the suburbs. I know. You? But… You take it, my Eldorado? He knows what I sell is sublime. Tell that to jerks, we know you’re selling cars. We know that is a cover. Your real job is a terrorist. Two weeks ago. You sank a boat to Tripoli. And last week, you destroyed missiles at the Italian border. That’s just what I tell the chicks to excite them. I’m a bum. I’m afraid of everything. Not it’s not. That would be… I’ll be gone. I’m nothing. I’m just hit up chicks. I’m forced to fuck people. What would I want? It’s only right you give me freedom. Three years. What’s your question? As soon as I turn around, you’re going to shoot me. Turn around. No way. Range chicken. Anything special at the library? No, not really. Very usual. You look worried. Oh, yes. that’s for sure. A sticky problem I cant' fix for the boss. The lot public servants, We take our jobs too hard. Don’t worry. I’ll answer. Hello yes. She's here. Don’t quit hang up. Helene, it’s for you. Yes. Jean Fleury, Topaz. Listen carefully to what I say. Yes, You have your first mission. At this hour? Do you understand? Of course. Immediately. The Royal hotel. The concierge will have an envelope. Your instructions are inside. Right now? Execute. Good Noel, you’re not moving. I’m on my way. I have to go. You know. Noel, my town hall colleague. Her husband has left her. There she is.

It’s cheating. You were never here. Then I came back from Baghdad. How about tomorrow? I’m going back to northern Ireland. and I also have an apartment on avenue Foch. Avenue Foch in Paris. Oh yes. 1F 10. but right now it’s being watched by night services. Here it’s crap. It’s needed. It’s a safe house. I can’t be found. Come on get out of here. The shooters who are about to show up… He shouldn’t get his hands on a major agent. We’re going to go. We’re leaving. Don’t have to dress? In my car. At the same time you’ll see. Foch Avenue The man? He wasn’t alone. There was gunfire but managed to get away. What’s my code name? It’s Fleury. Secret agent? For a little while. You too? Sleeping with a man. My husband. but he has nothing to do with it. He’s a telecom engineer. Your husband is an agent. His codename’s Eppe. I paid to find out. No, he is a civil servant. but true he is well rated by his superiors. No, he put me up to my neck, because he blew up a shipment I bought for Montpelier. In a truck in a parking lot in Italy? Yes, but it wasn’t not my husband. So, who is it? It’s Simon. Go on. Very strong A little obsessed. but genius. You know where he is? Yes. Are you going to tell me? No, you’re going to hurt him. You’re coming with us. Ah yes. It’s fine. We spend our time getting dressed after undressing. Ever since I’ve done it like this, It’s crazy how much time I save. That’s the guy who was with her at the royal hotel. Eppe. Because he is a very sharp agent One of the best. Not at all, it’s Francois, my husband. Is she your wife? Can you imagine a guy, after 18 years marriage, put himself up in hotel Royal with his own wife? She’s a call girl. has nothing to do with it. You’re sick. Tell them you work at the telecom. That we are married. That we have 2 children. It’s a poor mythomaniac who takes a bastard. Let her go back to her shed. Look at this. Your last assignment put me in a difficult position with my employers. He suspects me of being a double. You have to meet him. Set the record straight. Take off your clothes. Take of your clothes. There are often radio beacons, micro cam in your clothes. Take off your shoes. Especially, the shoes. In Paris, it’s folkloric, but where we’re going it’s local color. Soon, you’ll be able to talk all you want. I have a friend who makes people talk. In summer, there are thousands of kilometers cover. Your service can’t help you. Go ahead and talk. My husband works in telecommunications. Of course, and you’ve been married ever since… 18 years. And you. You’ve been married to the action department ever since… Since third. Sorry, darling, but secrecy is a rule of the service. My secret hero? A real secret agent. I mean. A real secret agent. Yes. It’s true. You've lied to me all these years? It is standard that jumped. it was not the standards. Special broadcast. You, my husband. A civil servant. You’re risking your life. No more than now. We also have questions for your husband. His actions have caused a lot of problems. My friend, Samir. You will tell us everthing. The organization of your service. What you know about us, and your operations. He adores vivisection. without anesthesia. A secret agent never talks. Unless we tackle what he holds most dear. Stop. I’ll tell you everything. Honey, don’t worry about me. It doesn’t matter. In the back room. You’re not allowed to speak Algerian. Now that we’re between men. Those missiles… You cashed in the money. and then you destroyed them. Their destination was the one originally planned. but it was a for just cause. In his country, Izmir and the leader of the anti-government resistance. He cared a lot about Caesar. Opponents of regimes shift n the direction of the wind. Our industry needs to sell a lot of weapons. For every gun sold, an opponent sends ten. Goverments, they fight. They begin to take revenge on all the French people. Tonight at the park of Princes in Paris. There’s a football game between your team and that of his country. This is a great opportunity to strike a popular forum and opinion. I’ll see what I can do with your government afterwards. He’ll be much more understanding. Of course, you tried to escape. I advise 20. Good morning to play outside. Hey. You in there. Dinner. Helene, It’s me. Francois. Don’t ask any questions. But I still have the right to know were we are. Four planes. That’s 2000 kilometers from Paris. Given the atmosphere, an Arab city. Marekesh, Tripoli, Istanbul. I dont know. I don’t know Arabic Istanbul. Yes, I know it’s Turkish. Okay. He’s busy. I’ll call back in 1/4 hour. Get the two French. Why are you waiting to shoot? One shot and we’re dead. Get going. French embassy, please. Ha! The French embassy. You’re going to walk. You’re going to talk. Don’t you all see the French embassy? Why the French embassy? He’s planning an attack at the Princes Park in Paris. We must not be heard speaking French. Superway. Francois, It’s Paris. To Barbe’s credit. They’ve been going around. But why all this number? An agent away from his base. His service can’t help. Sometimes he talks. as a last resort. For you. Go home. They must be worrying. French Embassy Ah, he gets drunk to forget. Hang up. Your car? Let’s go. What are you doing here? I told you to go home. We’ve been a team for 18 years. No? Open the trunk. But, Francois. Do you want to join me? You do everything I say. Get your gun. So that’s it. Are you ready? Whenever you want. I’m going to go. See a problem. Shoot it. You’ll see. You like it. Easy The notary! Too late. Will launch in less than two minutes. There’s nothing I can do to stop it. Albert. Listening. In two minutes, a missile will hit the Prince park. Where are you? Next to the launchpad. There’s nothing I can do. Why are you in the old Courneuve factory? Why do you ask? Look out. We rigged the missile to explode on launch. What? I told you get out of there. There’s nothing we can do. He won. You can’t give up. We can’t do anything more. We’re leaving. You can’t. It’s not possible. We can’t just sit here. But, Francois! You scared? Yes. But I like it. Hide it in the kitchen. Francois, will be here soon. Yes, Victoria emergency. Oh no. Not tonight. It’s my birthday. Helene certainly prepared her usual surprise. Make it work. No. It's not a joke. Good evening. Come in. Francois will be very late. Duty calls. The terrorist Carlos is in the room with a young woman. We were ordered to intercept alive. and we’ve got guys because there’s a lot of people. Boss. Here we go. You’re going to work with Fleury. You worked very well on the previous mission. Carlos is sitting at this table. We managed to free this one. There’s at least 10 yards. We couldn’t find any closer. Had to adapt to his hiding in the room. Go change. You’re a couple who have been married 10 years. Came especially from the sacks to celebrate. At 10:30 PM. Machine precision. Plunge the room into total darkness. Then you go. The guy behind the column whose left arm is visible. The 3 men near the bar. A gorilla. And this one too. Guarding the room. Two more. Then anything can happen. He’s very dangerous. Last time we tried to squeeze, he made the powder talk. He killed three people behind him. You like to flirt with death. It’s good. Do you mean that? Everone seeks to seduce the other. It’s better not to home together. How does a burst of machine gunfire feel? Terrible. Tingling. Stinging that turns into burns. You can smell it. If you got the guts. From the front. So, it’s often shot in the back. My, love. It’s funny. I didn’t see Carlos like this at all. You still want my Eldorado?
