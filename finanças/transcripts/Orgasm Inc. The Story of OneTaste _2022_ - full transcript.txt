The only thing that ever heals, the only thing that ever awakens is connection. I do think we have a pleasure deficit disorder in this country. It's getting faster and faster, our world is getting really hyper-connected, but human connection is beginning to dissolve. I do think, though, that there is a cure, and that cure is female orgasm. Hi. My name is Nicole Daedone, and I'm the founder of OneTaste Urban Retreat Center. She really was a celebrity to me. Like, I'd seen her TED Talk 30 times. I have this vision that someday you'll see yoga and meditation and orgasm all on the same bill. Welcome to the Orgasm Is pop-up shop. Is. Orgasm Is. Yeah. Hi! People began to flood into our doors, person after person after person. That's one reason why I love living in Silicon Valley. Every single option you could imagine available in this city. It was all about exploring orgasm, exploring pleasure. To feel that open and that safe with another human being, every single woman should know she can feel that. I'm a lot more conscious just of my own power in my sex. The next thing we knew, we were invited into all of these tech circles. She wants to have this elite group of turned-on, hip men and women. I was a lonely, nerdy guy. OneTaste opened up a world I didn't even dream was possible. That feeling that had driven me my whole life, seeking or trying to connect in relationship or sex or any of those things, it was like... "This is it." It went from, like, utopia to a hellhole. She would just become fascinated with what she could get people to do. That was kind of, like, her secret thrill. People were getting hurt. People were getting hurt badly. She thought she was saving the world by taking people's money and messing up people's emotions. Welcome to hell. When you look at orgasm, what I found is it has the same fundamental goal as the internet, and that's human-to-human connection. OneTaste was a fast-growing startup in the health and wellness, and sexuality space. It was started by Nicole Daedone. Having spent a lot of time thinking about Nicole, I think of her as a very skilled craftsman. She seems to know what people will gravitate toward. People wanted to hear from a woman. People wanted to see a woman like her at the top of a company like this. This was really women-led, and I think that was important based on what OneTaste were teaching. Orgasmic meditation is a way to connect to yourself, connect to your partner, to feel more in your body. I'm a lot more physically close to people and less afraid of more affection, and it's teaching me to really ask for what I want and say the vulnerable thing that might be scary to say. At the fundamental level, we all want the same things. We want to love, be loved, see, be seen, know our purpose and feel connection. Nicole is very compelling. She's someone who put others at ease when she was around them... We love you all. Happy birthday! ...and whose special gift was setting a vision that people were excited about and were willing to do a lot of things in order to help advance. Go ahead and take a moment to really feel where you are and the people that came here tonight, maybe noticing, "Oh, I want to talk to that person later." Making contact. Maybe you're avoiding contact. Noticing the patterns. Women and relationships were always a mystery to me. And I didn't understand how to, like, find a girlfriend. But I wanted to get laid, and that was, like... this, like, fly in the ointment, you know? I'd heard about OneTaste, and then finally, a friend of mine at the time was like, "Oh, we're gonna go to an in-group at OneTaste." "Do you wanna come with us?" The building was at 1074 Folsom. We walk in, and it's like this big, open space. Everybody's hanging around, talking, like, kind of like a cocktail party, almost. It's just, like, a warm, friendly vibe, which, to me at the time, is, like, odd, almost suspect. I was used to all the cocktail parties in the whole tech scene, where, you know, everybody's aloof. But this was totally different. Warm, open, friendly, and the person I'm sitting next to, there's this kind of presence that you feel, and then I look at her and I go, "Oh." 'Cause on the website was the picture of the woman that founded OneTaste, Nicole Daedone, and I'm like, "Oh, you're Nicole." And then we just immediately started talking about the idea of integrating sexuality and spirituality. I don't think that there's anything... of a higher order than having my body feel so good that I emanate a good feeling... ...and that that good feeling can catch on to you, and that we can begin to pass it on to each other. And when we feel good, strangely enough, we act well. So, there's this way that, it seems to me, all there really is to do is to be happy, so happy that it overflows and I have enough for you, and I want to share it in any way I possibly can with you. What happens in the face of really intense sensations is that the mind wants to go either toward really good or really bad. And that's what we tend to do with sexuality. It's either beautiful and beloved, or it's this nasty, evil thing. But we don't know how to move in the dynamic reality that occurs in between those poles. Hi. We are redefining what orgasm is. Everything you see on the wall is written by somebody who just came in to write what orgasm is for them. OneTaste would have really low-key events, and the people who were working radiated this happiness or attractiveness. They invite you to do yoga with them, they invite you to help them run another event, and you get sort of swept up in it. Orgasm is awesome, orgasm is amazing, orgasm changed my life. Not only were all these happy, friendly people I was hanging out with part of this organization, they all lived together. Whoo! OneTaste rocks! Welcome to OneTaste San Francisco. I'm gonna take you all on a little tour inside the building. Come on in. This is Alicia, and she does orgasmic haircuts. Hi, guys. Hi. My, how she uses her hands. There's some yoga going on. Maybe we could take a quick little peek inside. - You can't film that. - This is the front of our warehouse. A little messy right now. Who left their laundry here? And this is our center during the day. I started reading online. There was, like, an online forum where people would post their comings and goings, like threesomes, foursomes, n-somes. So-and-so having a make-out with so-and-so, and so-and-so watching someone making out. I was like, "What is going on? Like, this can't be real." "This has gotta be all made up. I'm sure this isn't actually happening, and if it's happening, there's no way they're gonna let me in." But then, sure enough, no, it was the real deal. One night I was living on a boat by myself, and the next night I was living in a warehouse with, like, 40 people and sharing a bed with my "research partner." I was, like, this nerdy techie guy by day, you know, fixing people's computer problems, and then I'd go home at night and, you know, be in the middle of this craziness. Welcome to OneTaste. Tell us, how do you do it, Alicia? How do you stay so sexy? I use my Amorepacific Treatment Cleansing Foam. Is that your secret? I thought it was orgasmic meditation. I OM... I OM every day and I use Amorepacific. I OM and I don't eat any sugar. And I always tell the truth. What does it mean to say that I'm a practitioner of orgasmic meditation? For purposes of simplicity, I'm going to describe it as a man and a woman, just so that I can say "he" and "she," but it can be all different, crazy configurations. Nicole is certainly a genius. Brilliant idea to name it an OMing session. An orgasmic meditation. Because there's so many seekers, so many spiritual seekers in the Bay Area and around the world. You've turned this sex practice into a spiritual practice. She will lie down. There'll be a pillow underneath her head, a pillow underneath each leg. She'll butterfly open her legs. And then he will get his finger onto her upper left-hand quadrant of her clitoris. The upper left-hand quadrant is a location that they have found, scientifically, to have a bundle of nerve endings. Some say 8,000, some say 800,000, I don't know. But they cannot find any reason for this bundle of nerve endings other than pleasure. The thing that will prevent you from knowing you hit the spot is hoping you're hitting the spot, not sure you hit the spot. "What's the spot? I'm never gonna find the spot. It's impossible." That will be the thing that will stop you from the natural human intuition of feeling this little, slightly electric... You'll also know because she'll go... ...and she will not, in any way, at all, move her hips. She won't be doing weird moans. She'll just be what we call "nailed." So, then you will just stroke up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down. - What am I gonna say next? - "Up, down." There you go. For 15 minutes. It's so simple. The man, if he's a good doer, he'll start to say, "The lips of your pussy are starting to fill with fluid, and the shades of pink and coral and ruby." "And starting to build tumescence," is a word that they used a lot, which was to build the turn-on, to build the energy. Lighter, faster strokes will bring somebody up, and then slower, firmer strokes will bring somebody down. So, you bring them up, and then you plateau them, then you bring 'em up, and then plateau 'em. This is how you hit the other dimension that you sense, in your body, is possible when you're having sex, and maybe that you glimpse, or that moment that you glimpse in orgasm, where there's just nothing... This is how you get to exist in that place sustainably. The stroking practice was phenomenal. And for me as a human being, you know, putting that much attention on just that one tiny spot on your index finger, touching the woman's clitoris, just stroking... And from that one point, it opens up all these channels as a man that I just never even knew were accessible to me. The idea that her toe would wiggle and I could feel a little tingle in my finger, that was, like, connected. And it was like, "What? Like, how is that even possible?" So, these are things that unfolded in the practice. Of course, when I started, I had no idea what I was doing, and I was lucky if I could even get on the clitoris. The guys here said, "All I want is to have more sex." "Please, please." They didn't realize they're immersed on an island of women who want sex. And so they were having, like, 20 OMs a day. Their little fingers were in braces, and they were, like, locking themselves behind the door. "Nicole, get me out of here. Please, no more sex!" I was like a lot of guys I knew in the tech world in San Francisco, starved for just basic physical affection. And OneTaste opened up this world of intimacy and connection and sex. What she was selling was an innovation in relating to your sexuality. The Bay Area is a place where people are gonna be attracted to and open to that kind of idea, and where they, frankly, might have a little extra money to buy courses. He said to me, "I'm gonna describe your pussy now. Is that all right with you?" I remember thinking I've never had somebody do that before. It felt like somebody touched the deepest part that existed inside of me. I felt so exposed and so vulnerable, and I remember thinking, "Oh my God, I don't think I've ever been that intimate with another human being before in my life." I've talked to many people who said orgasmic meditation changed their life, that it helped them experience sexual pleasure that they thought was unreachable for them. And especially women who said, "I've never had an orgasm before, and this helped me redefine what sexual pleasure could mean for me." "You know, I had felt like there was something wrong with me, and now there was this alternative that was presented to me that allowed me to embrace my body rather than feel ashamed." My first introduction to orgasmic meditation was when I saw a demo of OM. And I remember that night, it was like... It was like... Like, the finger found the spot. And I was just like, "Oh, I feel like my whole body, just, like, opened up." That's beautiful. - Thank you. - Yeah. Describe your sex to me. Timid and shy, which is frustrating at times, but I feel like I'm in the right place. Over the course of my four years living and working at OneTaste, I became more relaxed and social in a way, and I think people could see it. I became okay with men giving me attention at work, I became friendlier towards them, and my career took off. I guess I owe that to learning a lot about men at OneTaste, you know. They were really, like, encouraging us to see the soft, sensitive, emotional sides of men. So this is the building that was what we called the center, 1074. That's where we would hang out most of the time during the day, and then upstairs was the yoga studio, but also the main classroom space where we would hold practice every morning. And then this is 1060. This was the warehouse. I always loved that there was that behind-the-red-door quality. Yeah, so now it's a BDSM dungeon and a play space. I remember the first bed I had was on this side, in the corner there, and then later on I had one here. I was sleeping in one right here at one point. I was up in the loft. Ten, 12, 13, 15... I mean, at least 15 beds. And I remember the first night I moved in, and it was nuts. Like, there was so much energy in my body. All the... Yeah, that buzzy, lively energy of... Of people... ...you know, exploring sex. You know, my mom died when I was 13 years old, and there's nothing that a 13-year-old kid can possibly be prepared for in any way to have that experience or lose someone that close to them. So, I think on some level, I was learning how to connect with women so that I could be able to let people come and go in my life and not feel the grippy attachment. I was a software engineer in Silicon Valley. I was pretty successful, except in my personal life. I was just kind of a walking encyclopedia of all the ways you can be bad with the opposite sex. I had a few different nicknames at OneTaste. One of them was Yoda, and I think it's partly because of my stature. I'm 5'0". I'm five feet tall. And so, in a way that was good because I was a counterexample to all of the men who thought they had to be a certain thing in order to actually have good relationships with women. We're in this place now where women are actually self-sufficient. They don't need men to protect them anymore, or to care for them anymore, or to, like, provide for them anymore. So, what can men do, right? What women want is someone who's actually there meeting them as an equal and ready to play. I think OneTaste was a place where really what we were doing was increasing human connection, and researching human connection. Like, what happens when you are vulnerable with someone? What happens when you are more truthful than you've ever been with someone? And what happens when you expose your clitoris to someone? All of this stuff that people avoid because it's so scary is precisely where people need to go in order to have true, nourishing human connection. The best thing you have to lose is that sense of hopelessness that you will ever... be reached deep inside. I probably re-watched that TED Talk, like, 20 or 30 times. I really felt like something she was saying in that talk touched me. Like, something about it was more than sexuality, it's about real connection and realness. You get to have this most profound and deep experience with another human being. There's a certain magic that comes from putting attention on other people, instead of always focusing on your needs and your wants and your goals, which... In OneTaste, through OMing, we learned how to really put our attention on other people's feelings, which is basically what empathy is. But not just, like, "I can feel when you're happy or sad." But like, I can feel the moment that you think I'm lying, or I can feel the moment that, like, you pull back. Precision with empathy. It felt so good to feel like you're helping them help people. Whoo! It's like our lives are such a good TV show. Just to watch it, like, in real, like, real time. Hmm. And I'm so grateful that, like, life is just so interesting. Mm-hm. In high school, my anxiety was, like, almost debilitating. In my early twenties, I learned how to put a mask over it. I still had anxiety and I still felt terrible most of the time. So, to be, you know, in a space where I could really be real, it was like incredible medicine for me. We're gonna do this exercise three times. My first class, the first half of the day was Nicole speaking to people, giving impromptu coaching. Giving them "strokes" was the term. That was life-changing, because she could cold-read people with such accuracy that, if you're open to it, it could maybe change your life, give you a new perspective. She'd say, like, "What are you here for?" For some people she'd just say "Thank you'" and move on. And when it got to me, I was starting to say something mundane like, "Oh, sex is interesting, so I signed up for this class," and I could see she was already turning away from me, like that wasn't a good answer. So she was gonna shift, and then I just blurted out, "I want to connect with people for real." And she turns back to me, and it felt, you know... It felt really good to get her attention. Ultimately, what we're aiming for is to create a permanent meeting space. So, no matter how whackadoodle she gets when she's stuck up here in her ego, she knows that I can get in there. And she read me and she said, "I know why you don't connect with people." "It's like you're trying to stay in this tonal range." "It's a nice range, but you're denying people the whole spectrum." "You trying to act like a super cute frat boy, who says everything's cool all the time, when really you're a dark, dangerous man." And no one had ever spoken to me like that before. I don't know if she was reading something in me for real or reading something that I wanted to be true, but it felt like the most resonant thing anyone had said to me. I did feel like I put up a facade with people to be liked, but inside I was angry, I was frustrated, you know, I felt dark inside. It was life-changing, just that beginning before I ever OMed. I got over a fear of being seen, a fear of vulnerability that I had my entire life. Hey, would you like to have an OM? Sure. Okay. I've only done it once or twice though. That's okay. - When's a good time? - Uh, now if you're not busy. All right, let's go. OneTaste, the idea was to get this thing out into the world, right? Well, it became evident pretty quickly that I could, like, shoot video and tell a little story, and, like, boom, we've got, you know, some media. So this is what you need to know to truly learn how to handle a woman's pussy. That's right. We just said, "Learn to handle a woman's pussy." Nicole, she wanted to leverage that, you know, right away. And so that sort of became my raison d'être... and eventually became my real raison d'etre. Like, I quit my job so that I could be the video guy for OneTaste. "Your sex is not a problem." "We've been living in a paradigm of wrong for too long." And what if you could learn how to become a master of the vagina? Today, we're going to discuss why everyone is going to be happier when you learn how to give a woman a 15-minute orgasm. If you all don't know, Nicole's first book was released on May 25th, Slow Sex: The Art and Craft of the Female Orgasm. And it's come out to some really great reviews and publicity. Just this weekend, Nicole was at TEDxSF giving a lecture to 750 people... This was a practice that intrigued reporters whenever they heard about it. It was like, "Orgasmic meditation? Like, what is that?" Fifteen minutes? Fifteen minutes. That's a lot of orgasm. That's a lot of orgasm. Yeah. The OneTaste Urban Retreat, not your average yoga studio. The pants come off the women, and soon, the studio erupts in female ecstasy. Nicole knew that it couldn't be so kooky, you know, and it had to become more about wellness, more about women feeling empowered. A visual testimony on how orgasmic meditation is practiced. They started having offices in Los Angeles, New York, London. They started expanding internationally... The statistics are terrible. Thirty percent of women self-report that they don't reach orgasm when they want to. In 2013 and 2014, they held these conferences, weekend-long conferences with thousands of attendees. Thank you for coming to OMX! They just started collecting more and more money from sales of courses. At one point, OneTaste started selling a thing called membership that was, like, $50,000-plus, which allowed whoever the customer was to take any class for the whole year. By the time 2017 came around, the company had about $12 million in revenue. That was the year that they were on a list of fast-growing startups by Inc. magazine. And it was a reflection of Nicole's desire to make OneTaste mainstream. I'm Gwyneth Paltrow, and you're listening to the Goop Podcast. Today's guest is the very magnetic Nicole Daedone. She's a... OneTaste caught the eye of really influential people, in particular, Gwyneth Paltrow, who was not only someone who's very influential in Hollywood, but also someone who's this, like, wellness god. Nicole is also the author of Slow Sex, which is a book I often recommend to women who are looking for more desire in their relationships. I really wonder if she was trying to do an L. Ron Hubbard. "Let's get some famous people in." That was one of the many brilliant things the founder of Scientology came up with, was the power of celebrity. "If we can get movie stars, music stars, and people like that in our ranks as our public face, boy, that makes us really attractive to your average Joe or Jill out there." And he was absolutely right. And so, I could see her kind of following that lead as well. In late 2017, I was contacted by a woman who works in communications, and she said, "Hey, can we talk on the phone?" "I have a story I think might be interesting to you." "It's about a fast-growing company run by women in the wellness space, and it's called OneTaste." And this was in 2017, and the #MeToo movement was just getting going. And I remember the way she pitched it was, "You know, this is a company that's gonna help people connect with each other in a way that is gonna help mitigate some pain we've seen come up with the #MeToo movement, because it helps people be more sensitive to each other's needs." And I mentioned to a friend of mine that I was considering writing about OneTaste. And my friend told me, "I know somebody you should talk to." "They used to be a customer of this company and they had a pretty bad experience." So, I ended up having a long conversation with this person for several hours, hearing their story. And at the end of that, I thought to myself, "Wow, this is really different from any of the reporting that's out there about OneTaste currently, and this might be a big story." When you are looking at Nicole, you're looking at Nicole and she's looking back, and she locks into your eyes, it is like you are being completely seen, like, down to your soul, including everything, yuck and all, especially yuck. And while you're being, like, embraced in this gaze, also being, you know, picked apart like you're under a microscope. And so she starts playing this game with me, which is pulling desires. And so she says, "What do you want?" So, you know, she's fish... She's pulling them out, so I say, "I want to have more sex, I to have want more orgasm." "I want to have more fun, I want more community." So, she's going, "Come on, what else?" This is how this goes. And so, finally, I get down in my belly, in my womb, to like, "Wow." And I had never spoken it out loud, and I said, "I want to have a baby." And I was like... And she's like, "Not so fast. What else?" I was like, "That's it." "What else?" And so finally I say, "Okay, I wanna have a demo." A demo is a demonstration of a woman in orgasm for an hour. And Nicole goes... And she looks around. "Did you hear that? We hit bottom." "That was it. That's the bottom desire." And so, here I have said, in front of all these people, that I wanna have a demo, knowing full well that that was not at the bottom. That was Nicole's desire. So, I was just fully giving over to Nicole. The type of personal reflection that they encouraged us to do was all about finding your deeper desire. Yet, they would do this complicated psychological thing of inserting their desire into you and telling you that it's yours. What's your real big desire? What's your real big, deep desire? What turns on your pussy? - I want to coach and teach for OneTaste. - Fuck, that's awesome. "This is how Nicole manipulated people." "She agreed that something was true if it matched what she wanted to hear." "If you said something she didn't like, she called it a lie, or, 'That's not the end of your desire.'" "If you had any doubt, she knew how to increase that doubt until what she told you was true became what you believed." So, Bill and I pay Nicole $15,000, which, according to Nicole, at the time was a very good deal, and my course begins. A lot of people described to me going to some event where they were first exposed to OneTaste, and maybe there was an explicit pitch for the company or taking a class. I'm gonna have one of our sales associates Lindsay come up and talk to you about a special offer for all of you for attending tonight, and also for being on the web. And then the pitch just gets bigger and bigger. "Why don't you take this week-long, intensive class?" "Come and learn from Nicole, or come help us teach a class." "Why don't you come help us with sales?" We need an initiation ceremony or something edgier. We need something that they are locked in, they are in for the full weekend, for the full ride. Rachel would be pitching the $15,000 coaching program. And at the time, I was just barely making ends meet as a freelance writer, but somehow, it felt so good to meet with her for a sales call anyway. I told her in the beginning, "I don't have money, I can't buy anything," and she just made it feel good to come hang out with her and talk about my life. And similar to my experience with Nicole, I felt so good and so seen afterwards. So when she asked, "Do you want to take the coaching program?" "We can put you on our payment plan," I found myself giving her my credit card before I even realized. So I gave her, you know, this card. It was $1,000 a month, which put me into debt immediately. But then afterwards, I had to justify my purchase, and that put me in deeper. I've had people describe to me this sales tactic of, we play some sort of communication game like hot seat. Someone's sitting in the middle, being asked a bunch of questions. And in the back, OneTaste staff are taking notes. They're writing down, you know, "This person's recently divorced." "This man feels unsure how to approach women." And then they strategize about who's the best OneTaste staffer to be sent over to that customer to try to win them over. Imagine you come to me and you say, like, "Well, yeah, I'm interested in OneTaste because, you know, I've had trouble keeping a long-term relationship," and I'd ask you something like, "Can you imagine if that were true for the rest of your life?" You make the pain bigger, so that what you offer as a solution sounds more appealing. Nicole's very brilliant at seeing wounding. And so that's what she hooks into, and then becomes the salve of that wounding. So then, you're not feeling the wound when you're in her presence, but you're reliant upon her to guide you. And then, on top of that, there was this very strong connection between how well you were doing spiritually in the OneTaste teachings and your ability to sell courses. They really saw that as connected, they thought that a more turned-on woman would sell courses better because they would be projecting their turn-on to the customers, where it was almost like channeling this divine force that would help you in such an earthly pursuit as closing a sale. "I'm a turned-on pussy, feeling and savoring every stroke going through me, sent back out with power and love to shine." Yeah! We were supposed to talk about cock, like, talk about, like, crass, nitty-gritty sexual stuff, 'cause that's hot, that's what we're trying to do at OneTaste. You know, it turns people on when they get that flutter in their stomach when you just said, like, "cock" or "pussy," which actually probably, like, embarrasses people. I don't know if that's turn-on or discomfort. At one point Nicole is, like, "We're gonna teach this thing called 'orgasmic rebalancing.'" And she did a demo of what orgasmic rebalancing was. You know, you can kind of see from the footage, the closest thing would be like reiki, where you're moving energy in the body. I'm sure the footage... I haven't looked at it in a while, but I'm sure it looks crazy. I was immediately taken by Nicole. I thought she was just very charismatic, but at the same time, I could see that she was a hustler. Tell me a bit about that. Is Nicole Daedone a con artist? Yeah. You got to dissect that word though. It means "confidence." It's like, yeah, she can say things in such an enthusiastic way and have so much knowledge around it that she is a fantastic salesman. I am interested in letting my body be used in the transmission of the experiences that have been given to me. There is an experience of beauty that one feels when something is in harmony. This was that kind of beauty. Today, I am immersed in it. I feel here that there is something inside of me connected to everything. There's an intimacy that I feel with my partner, the bed, the plants. The world becomes one giant network of neurons, and this entity that I call Nicole is part of this. If you're looking at that footage from the Stinson demo, what you're seeing is... batshit nuts. Come on. Someone's up there, completely naked, getting her pussy stroked, there's someone with snakes there and... Right? Like, all this stuff... Like, what is going on? And to me... ...all that stuff was just there to create a certain kind of aura for the people in the room, like investors. I wonder if the New York Times reporter was there. The Stinson Beach demo, it's very intense. It seems like... Sometimes she's laughing, sometimes she's crying. There's a lot of moaning. You hear people in the audience expressing their sensations. You know, "It's like a warmth in my belly, or like a tingling in my face." Rachel Cherwitz shepherds some of the audience members up to, like, touch Nicole's thigh while the demo is going on. They describe it like it's meant to be like you can feel the energy of this experience. You realize, "Holy shit, I'm actually experiencing things in tandem with this woman who's getting stroked in front of me." "Like, I'm actually feeling stuff in my body too." And even though I think most people would watch that and think, like, this is bananas... Um... it looks like the people in the room feel like something really is happening. I hope you really got a sense tonight of what it's like to have a woman, a fully-trained woman, get off. And see the places that she can go. It's just unmatched. I mean, there's nobody else that... who I stroke, that can do what she does, and I want all of you to be able to do what she does. I'm in agreement. - Please. - Me too. When I took the course, by that point, we had both female and male OMing, and my partner was very skittish about doing a male. So, Nicole stepped in personally, and I had a meltdown. I started shivering, crying. Tears were rolling down my cheeks. Then she sort of moved me to her breasts and started stroking my head. And the part of me that wasn't having a meltdown, the rational little control center there, was thinking, "Oh yes, Nicole, I know what you're up to." "You're making yourself my mommy." "You're holding me gently, tenderly in your lap next to your breasts, and stroking my head and looking lovingly at me." "You're trying to imprint me as mom." It didn't work. I guess if I didn't have that little skeptical bit in my consciousness, maybe I would've really bonded with her. Maybe I would've gone all in for OneTaste and been one of her really fervent members and defenders. But I didn't. You're all welcome to come get stroked, and we have darshan from 11:00 to 1:00, Monday through Friday. and it would be my honor to stroke anybody in this room and have you have... If you look at Zen Buddhism or any of these things, there's levels of being ready for the next piece of truth. Whenever it became public that there was also a male stroking practice, all the men were like, "I want that, I need that." Like, "I empathize with what these women experience about starving." "I'm starving too, I wanna get stroked as well." And it would become a quagmire. So, we kept it private. As soon as that was on the table, it changed everything. So we just had it not be, "It is not on the table." "It is not on the table that there is a male stroking practice." Someone joked around, "Oh, it's like a spiritual hand job." And right, so that's the problem, is, it can devolve into a hand job, and we wanted it to be something very different than that. Like, a woman stroking a man's penis brings up a whole bunch of cultural things that the reverse simply does not. What it means for a woman to be a sexual service provider and for a man to be in the position of being on the receiving end of sexual service providing. So, like, you couldn't just have them reverse and say, "Now this is OM." It ends up not being an OM. We have a female identity in our culture, right? The female is the victim. And if I, in any way, don't buy into that, then there's only two options with victim. There's villain. Your practice session where women are being OMed, orgasmic meditation, by men who are not present, don't know who they are, aren't clear in their sense of purpose. A woman cannot open her legs to a man at that level, and I think it's really important for you or someone who's highly trained to be here in these practice sessions. When the man impresses his shape into her, her whole body feels that, her whole consciousness is ignited, but I think that you need to tighten up the practice sessions. What you say, for me, feels like, uh, protection of women in such a way that it continues an idea that we need to be protected. And that idea keeps me not taking responsibility for my sex. So, I have a story, and I am no victim. The problem with the victim story, it takes away your power. If you wanna know the real way to deflect rape, it's to turn on 100%. Because then there's nothing to rape. Nicole had some very barbaric messages when she talks about the darkness that she has or the darkness that she came from. Trauma is just stuff that's stuck in the body that needs discharge. I think what you do... I mean, this is gonna be my suggestion every time, is you OM a lot. As you OM, whatever is in there begins to come out. It just progressively and gently opens you and releases, and then you can just face and be rid of, face and be rid of. And then pretty soon what you just notice is your capacity to sit in pain decreases, and you just gotta get that shit out fast, and then you're clear again. You know, my dad was a child molester, and he had experiences with young girls and used me as bait. And so that exact behavior... Whoa, of me colluding with somebody who would cause harm. And I got that seed out. I got free. I could forgive everybody in the whole experience 'cause I got free of that. I think I told the story in here when I was a stripper and they put a knife up to my throat. Nicole's biography is kind of a matter of mystery. You're never really sure what's actually true. I think her biography went through a lot of revisions as the company became more and more prominent. But she did talk about having worked as a stripper. Well, I have great cred. I come from darkness. She was a very highly paid call girl. She would tell stories about, you know, getting $700 for a trick, I think is the term. Then she had a thing where she would play around socially with people, like, mess with their heads. Guys, especially. Friend of mine was like, "Oh, she's a monster." "She's a monster." Like, "Stay away from her," and stuff. And that was very intriguing. We had done some LSD earlier one day, and she proposed to me. Having your wife be a sex cult leader was like... It was pretty interesting for me. It's like, I was totally ready to go buy a Harley and ride up the coast and be in a sex cult, are you kidding? And take LSD. I totally wanted to do all that stuff. Our mission plan, our business plan was this: 800,000 people trying to practice orgasmic meditation, 10,000 people at the level of mastery, or teachers, and a center in the major cities, all the major cities of the world. Rob Kandell was Nicole's first business partner. He was a guy who used to work kind of in a tech-finance job, and met Nicole, and they decided to start OneTaste together. When I first met Rob, he was married to Carol. They were part of Nicole's little cadre of followers. Nicole wanted Rob for his unending devotion, and also his bank account. You know, he was kind of like a nebbish-y guy, looking for approval, and Nicole had a really good sense of style, and so she would groom him, so he became hot. I was stroking a hot young thing on a warm Tuesday morning. She would borrow things from Scientology or, like, these different cults, even going back to stuff like Lifespring and est. The shamans say that a medicine man begins by falling into the power of demons. Now, in Kabbalah, it's called chesed and gevurah. In the darshan... There's a thing called Satguru... The desire sutras... It's sacred... In the more esoteric practices. I want to go see Amma. Zalman Schachter-Shalomi. Kalimah said... Wilke said... Think about the Buddha. Malcolm Gladwell. Rumi. BKS Iyengar. Krishnamurthy. The Tibetan Buddhist... Sort of like Mother Teresa. A universal sanctuary light-bearer. Shabbat. The love of Jesus. That is religion, and the dukh has it. All of this fucking crazy shit about sacred and spiritual and woman. Usually, if you touch the absolute, you have this realization. The realization is, "I am God." One taste, which is a Buddhist concept. The Buddha said, "Just as the ocean has one taste, the taste of sal
