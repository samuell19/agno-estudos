Female golfers. Nowadays in Japan... more and more... women play golf. So here at Rockets, this company... we plan to enter this market soon. What else? I'm sorry, I apologize. You know... boss Takahashi... should have given this presentation. But... he's on sick leave. 10 minutes before the meeting... the director, who rumors say is unfaithful to his wife, called me. And asked me to replace Takahashi. That's it. I'm sorry I'm not prepared. But why is the number of female golfers rising? Boom! It exploded! There was a trigger. Yeah... Golf cars! They started using golf cars. People didn't want to walk, and they complained... it's too hot, it's too cold, it's too far... but all this issues are now solved. So! Listen carefully. Golf cars allow... women to be on the golf course with their boyfriends. Even if it's too hot or too cold... they don't mind, and have fun. It's almost like a party. Golf cars changed sports for women. Female golfers really want to dress in a way... that sets them apart from the other women on the course. They want to be cute and sexy for their boyfriends. But all the other companies... don't care about female golfers. So what was their strategy? What are they doing? They focus on the club and on the ball spin rate. What else? On clothes breathability and warmth. These things... Breathability and warmth. They only focused on this stuff. You're yawning. What's the goal of this project? - Supporting the people! - What? Establish peace in Japan using golf. Raise birth rate and help the environment. Okay, stop, dumb kid. The goal is not so noble. Do you think this is that noble? But nice, it's good you have such noble ambitions. Thank you. You worked at a tech company before? Yeah, mixing duty and fun. You like the Internet? Only games and anime... uuh... We live in the digital age. The press and the TV are so obsolete. So you mixed your job and your passion. How was it? It didn't work. I thought it would have been fun, but... I saw a lot of unpleasant stuff standing behind the scenes. Suffering, and betrayal. An hobby should stay that, a place in your heart... Oh... Ops. Hirotaka?! Narumi? You work here? Last time we saw each other we were in high school. Are you a new hire? Yeah! How am I? - Is that a question? - Yes. Not... "how are you?" Yeah. Don't think too long. You... look good. Yes I do. See you. She's funny. Not "how are you?" Seemed kind. Do you still go to Comiket? What's a "Comiket"? Let's go. Yes or no? I don't know what that is! I think he mistook me for another girl. Are you free tonight? - Yes. - Let's meet. We need to talk. Your contact. QR code. Let's use the shake. Done. Ah! Hirotaka! Rocket bomb. Whoa, great throw. You're good. Stunned! I wanted to kill you. I didn't know it was a secret. I never imagined we would end up working together. Don't tell anyone I'm an otaku. If you do, I'll tell everyone you're a videogames otaku. Defeated! I don't hide it. Can I smoke? - Nope. - Shame. It's better to keep it a secret, it's hard to find a girl for an otaku. I'm good. You have a girlfriend? No. As expected. Otaku and a loner. Do you have a boyfriend? He left me when he found out I'm an otaku. He didn't like fujoshi* [fans of homoerotic yaoi media] He told everyone at the office, it was very embarrassing. Drink. I won't tell my next boyfriend I'm an otaku. I'll keep it a secret until I die. What if he doesn't care? If he doesn't care, that means he's an otaku too. And otaku boys are creepy. You're one to talk... No. You're not my type. I understand. You were dumped. You're my dear otaku childhood friend. Leave the otaku part out. Otaku friend. Thanks, Hirotaka-don. You're welcome, Narumi-don. Long last I'll be able to get new items. In this company I won't be set aside. Thanks to you, my dear partner. So, why not me? What? Are you stupid? Don't call me stupid. I can help you collect items and level up. I won't betray you, or make you cry. After all... I'm your otaku friend. Hirotaka... I can help you at Comiket.

Yuki, you're my senior here at the company. Please just call me Narumi. Answer my question. You're doing overtime together. We're childhood friends. He was helping me. I've fallen for him. What? Are you a couple? Please answer honestly. We're not... a couple. I'm so glad! So you're just friends! We are. What are you doing? Are you... dating Narumi? - Yeah. - Already? That was fast. We're childhood friends. So you already knew her. Wow. She's really cute. I was planning... to make a move on her. She like anim... Animals. Domestic animals. I'm lucky. You are.... You're dating, then? Yes. She's a little weird. - You are just friends, uh? - Yes. Why are you hiding? He's looking in this direction. She's hiding from you. What happened? I don't know. I don't understand the games girls play. Always referencing games... A videogames otaku always sees the world as it was a game. Shut up, idols otaku. Don't overgeneralize. I only like... voice acting idols. You underestimate them, don't you? They don't just have angelic voices, they're also cute. "Kyawa-taso". Know what that means? God! Damn... he's double angry. Double angry? Oh... it's nothing. She's so shy. Adorable. She reminds me of Mareitaso. - Mareitaso? - My favourite voice idol. Preventive attack! [ angry ] [ fight / make friends / run away ] [ Narumi runs away! ] [ It failed! ] Nifuji, about that document... Please spare my life! Sorry. I didn't want to scare you. I'm not sure about us. I saw you more like a friend. I shouldn't have said "I love you". He never did. I never did! Don't... say that. You were hesitant... but you tried to express your feelings, right? I'm happy. I'll try not to be embarrassed or avoid you. So... don't say you shouldn't have said it. Even if I don't think you actually did. Yeah, I didn't. But this encounter raised our intimacy level.

[ Momose ] Second lap! Here we go. Incoming! Take that! Final attack! Embarrassing! - Yeah! - Missed me. The mushroom! Unfair! There's a banana peel? Damn! What did you want to talk about? Let's have a date this weekend. A date? You and me? Yeah. Not just going out. Me and you going out is already extraordinary. What else? We'll spend time together, but not as otakus. What does that mean? The whole day, together... But otaku talk is forbidden. Don't overreact. It's just a date. But what we'll talk about, if not games and anime? Normal stuff. What does that even mean? Trendy restaurants. Movies. But not anime movies. You can ask me to help you choose a new gaming headset. - Things like that. - Is this what you want? What happens if I talk about otaku stuff? If you do that... Gulp. For every otaku sentence... - a 1000 yen penalty. - That much?! With that kind of money I can buy like two pins on Otome Road. - That's a penalty! - Why? Why can't we be otakus? I was observing you today. The way our relationship is evolving confused you. When you're with me, you lower your guard. And you're afraid you'll be exposed as an otaku at work. - You're right. - Then hide it. And train when you're with me. We'll call it... Plan No-Otaku. Plan No-Otaku. But you're an otaku... It's not for me. It's to avoid a Second Impact for you. I get it... and I appreciate you are worried about me, but... why a date? - Hey! - Yes? - I'm in your room. - So? Usually, it takes a few dates. When it's the right time... it happens. But this is like an Arcade Videogame. Wrong. It takes time before the guy is invited to the girl's apartment. But we're used to play games together. Let's go back to romantic relationship mode. Fine.

Hey, Hirotaka... Never mind. The No-Otaku date is over. Good job. Ah! The boys at the cafe? The young boy with glasses was trying to seduce his straight mate. Guitarist and bassist, listening to their music, sharing headphones. A deeply romantic melody, tuned to their love. But it's a love triangle! The older one can't control his jealousy. People fall in love in the most unexpected ways. By the way, two cute boys at the cafe... I'm thankful for the experience. And at the shop before, the cute girl near me had Lailah and Vesta keychains! I wanted to scream "I like them too!" And that clerk. His courtesy and attitude towards the patrons... Impressive! Almost 2.5D, right? His unobtrusive consideration for the patrons... He was a butler in his previous life. I'm sure about that. A legendary 19th century butler, come back to life! It was phenomenal!

Isn't Bourbon the name of a Konan character? That's not the reason. You look tired. What happened? I have a girlfriend. So the rumors are true? Everyone is talking about it. We're childhood friends. That's nice. It's much more healthy than playing videogames. Is it wrong for a guy... to interfere with his girlfriend's hobbies? Absolutely! You don't have the right! Hanako, lower your voice. I'm not doing it for myself. I'm doing it for her. But I'm starting to think it's not the right move. Do you want her to give up her hobbies and get into yours? Unbelievable.

I know you well, so be honest with me. About what? Progress? Still at the storyboard! Sorry. Uh? Must be hard for you. I'm a terrible girlfriend. No need to be sorry. I'm fine. I'm sure it's harder for you. I'm done with the screentone. And I changed panel 2 at page 12. Confirm, please. Hirotaka... You're so dedicated.

I couldn't find time to buy them. It's nothing. That area was filled with great stands. So much people you almost couldn't walk. It was weirdly efficient. I was buying stuff without thinking.

My underwear... what color is it? So you go home by bus, uh? My underwear is beige. I don't like the train. When we were children we always played together. I came to your home to play videogames. Yeah. Want to go to the voice idol Yuki Kaji event next week? Who? What? Are you serious? Eren in Attack on Titan. Shoto in My Hero Academia. Don't know. I don't like anime. I guess a videogame otaku wouldn't know about voice idols... Make yourself comfortable. My underwear is beige. When I visit someone, I always notice the smell. I don't smoke inside. Does it stink? No! The room smells... like you. I can tell it's your home. You know... the good smell of a friend. Panic. I'm talking nonsense. I don't have any friends. Minefield... Beer? Yeah, sure. Beer.

And... trash bags... put them in the right place. Also... sorting the trash. Recyclable and not. Take out the trash... Know where to put it. To get rid of it. - Small chores. - Exactly. So... have you ever been to Hawaii? - Nope. - Wouldn't you like to go? - Yes. - Why that pause? Don't you like the sea? Yes! I'm crazy about it. But don't go crazy for me! Anyway, the head of this project is the guy in charge of the photo shoot. Why he's not here? His name is Kabakura. I'll introduce him to you. Okay! Hawaii! I'm stoked!

Are you Mr Kabakura? I am. I'm Narumi Momose. Nice to meet you. The only reason I put you on the team is that the boss asked me to. I don't have time to waste. Got it. I'll do my best. So scary...

Nifuji. I need you to deliver something to the team in Hawaii. Because... you know... We don't need a courier for a package this size. But it's too big for a scooter delivery. It's in the middle ground. So you do it. Um... That's an order. Got it? You were on leave for a week. Make yourself useful if you want to keep your job. Yes. You look great together. - A cute couple. - Smile. Put your hand on her shoulder. Excuse me... Guys, you're beautiful. Okay, that's enough. I'm done. But the camera guy wants you. Excuse me. - Nifuji? - Hirotaka? Ah, the package from sales. Thanks, leave it there. - Nifuji... - Sakamoto, your turn. Don't worry, I'll tell him it was just a photo shoot. Leave it to me. You're late! You're late! This is not a solo event! Let's cheer as hard as we can! Mareitaso walks the stage... as number 2. We know! - Let's do it! - Let's do it! ♪ When our eyes meet, ♪ I get dizzy. ♪ I can't control this feeling. ♪ Every little thing dazes me. ♪ These feelings are so intricate, ♪ and the world is so strange. ♪ Turn and turn! Turn and turn! ♪ What's this ardent passion? ♪ Why are you uncomfortable? ♪ Don't worry if it's just a crush. ♪ I like many things, but just ♪ one I really want to be. ♪ Unwillingly, I'm growing up, ♪ I'm tired of this hairstyle. ♪ And if you keep looking at me, ♪ I couldn't ask anything more. ♪ It's beyond logic. I'm going. Nifuji! Nifuji! What's the matter? From me. ♪ You actually drank it ♪ I wasn't expecting that. ♪ You actually drank it ♪ It looks like bourbon... ♪ but it's just iced tea. ♪ Did you know? ♪ You emptied the glass ♪ acting all cool. ♪ But it was iced tea. ♪ Iced tea, tea, tea. Enough! Stop singing. Hey. Come with me. Why not? ♪ A beautiful woman like me, ♪ all alone. ♪ Too much time on her hands. ♪ What's wrong with this? ♪ Hey, look. ♪ A cute face and a great body. ♪ What else do you want? ♪ But what I really want ♪ I can't have. ♪ In this word, filled with joy, ♪ you are enough. Come with me. ♪ Let's have fun all night long. ♪ Dreams coming true. ♪ In this world that makes me dizzy, ♪ you'll be enough. You and me... ♪ let's live in a dream, tonight. That reminds me... we leave in 3 days. Am I... doing well on the team? So and so. I'll keep trying. Hey... Come to mine? I'm wearing pink underwear tonight, actually. I can't... You have a girlfriend. Idiot. It's not like that. - Let's stay here, then. - It could rain. True. I won't complain about my girl. It looks like... something is bothering you. I knew it. I need you to focus on our Hawaii trip. So let's talk about your troubles tonight. Thank you. Please. Why are the lights on? Maybe your girl is here. I doubt it. What the hell? Hirotaka?! What?! Narumi? - Who are you? - Hanako, what's this? I wanted to see him dressed as Heshikiri Hasebe. Wonderful, isn't he? Why here?! I wanted you to do it, but you'd have refused. What?! Stay back. It's pictures time. Oooh... not the best timing, uh? - What's happening? - My girlfriend. - And he's... - My... My boyfriend. - No! - Yes! What? What do you think? Shokudaikiri Mitsutada. You didn't like it. What about now? I was drunk and I couldn't see it well. Just tell me. You look great. You should have said that... But you're too old for this. What? You #$%&@! - Shut up, moron! - Leave! This is my house! You brought a girl here! I would never cheat on you! She wanted to talk! Bullshit! You brought here another man! What is yours is mine, and what is mine is mine. I'll kill you! You couldn't! You're a $%&@ and a @&%$! Yeah! A big #$%&@! - Should we leave? - Yeah. You like to spend time with anime otaku friends. So I thought me becoming one could have helped. Bringing us closer to each other. But switching genres is hard. That's why you took that leave? I wanted to get to know you better. Hirotaka... I... was dumped by my ex because I'm an otaku. But with you... it's much easier. I don't have to hide it. Still... you're not really my type. And I'm sure that I'm not yours, either. You're missing out. Missing out? Yeah, maybe. - Hey... - Forget it. - What are you looking at? - Forget it. - How dare you! - What's your point? I think... you'll be happier... - with a normal girl. - That's you. - I don't like otaku boys. - But it'll be easier. I don't like you because it's easy or because you're an otaku. I like you because you do what you want. We had some troubles... but we can be ourselves and enjoy what we like. Hirotaka, are you... in love with me? Think before you answer. You know, I don't think you ever said it. Not yet. So... Game room? Your turn.
