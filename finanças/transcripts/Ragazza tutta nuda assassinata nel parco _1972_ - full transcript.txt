NAKED GIRL KILLED IN THE PARK Look. JOHANNES WANTERBURGER robbed and killed in amusement park The man was killed not more than... a couple of hours after he bought a life insurance policy for $1m. - Very impressive. - Well... his health was excellent, his family situation ideal... solid economic position... so why shouldn't he have bought a policy? - It looks like robbery, rather than murder? - Not necessarily... You mean, because he was carrying a lot of money, which is gone? And then, what was he doing in a Tunnel of Horrors with a bagful of money? Have you asked yourself that? Anyway, you know very well, when a claim is for an amount as big as one million dollars, it's normal policy for our company to investigate the heirs. This will be your job. Given the situation, you are the most suitable. Why didn't you keep the appointment? I know who killed your father. And you know too, don't you, Catherine? You again. Enough. You know... Punctual as ever, Chris? You never change? I couldn't find my smoking dentures. Witty. She's already been here a while; waiting for someone, I'd say. Will you introduce me? - Lovely evening, isn't it, General? - Indeed, Madame. That's not her. She's the one sat by the column. - I met your granddaughter in Paris. - Yes? - A lovely girl. I'm very proud of her. At the school dance... You can't complain. Nice ankles... fantastic body... the face of an angel. Or a demon. Who knows... Certainly, she doesn't seem too upset by the death of her father. Well, I'm going to work. - Please, Miss Wanterburger. - You know me? You have a face that's not easily forgotten. It makes waiting easier. - Waiting, you say? - One is always waiting for something... Love, glory, pain, joy, death... or me, perhaps? Well, after all, it might be true. - This place is about as lively as a cemetery. Don't you agree? - What if I do? Well, there's nothing to keep us - we could go to dinner at a nice, quiet place. What is it? You don't like my proposal? Well then. If you're the man I've been expecting, why should I refuse? - So you're a journalist. - It's an honourable profession, is it not? - "Honourable"? A pack of jackals, harassing me since my father was murdered. - And you're the worst of all. - Me? - Yes, you. Those phone calls, promising revelations about my father's death... and then... Go on, ask me some questions. Then you can get your exclusive. assuming that... I would want to answer them. Calm yourself, Catherine, I've never phoned you... and I have no intention of publishing an exclusive. But then, why did you say... Perhaps my method of approach is somewhat unusual, but a girl as lovely as you shouldn't be surprised. - I'm afraid I've been foolish. - Not at all... I'm sorry to have caused a misunderstanding. - But who is it that's telephoning you? And why? - I don't know... Perhaps one of your colleagues, or a fanatic. What does it matter? My father is dead, and nothing will bring him back. Shall we dance? Here we are: the pied-?-Terre. Can you believe it? I often forget the name of the street. - Strange you know so little of the city. - I come here so rarely. - So, why are...? So why am I here now? Or why was I at a party, so soon after my father's death? - I already told you. - You mean those phone calls promising information about your father? Yes, it seems absurd that a businessman like my father would go to an amusement park... and also take with him such a large amount of money. Moreover, even the police think there was more to it than a casual robbery. And you were easy bait for someone in the mood for playing tricks. But back to us... What time should I pick you up tomorrow? You won't find a better driver in this city. - Alright then, how about 10 o'clock? - I'll try to keep away until then. Who is this? It's you, Chris. Already? I'm sorry. Ten minutes and I'll be ready. - Why here? - Why not? What is it? - I'm just rather tired. - There's a place over here. In good company, I see. - What can I get you? - Two beers. What are you doing here? My husband will see you. Go away. Let's go. Calm down. Try to get some rest this evening and go back home tomorrow. And then don't move without my permission, understood? I'll come to visit you, as usual. You know what you must avoid. but I might not be able to, this time. - Well? - Nothing serious, just a check-up. I came to town for that reason. - What check-up? Why didn't you tell me? - Don't worry, Chris. - I'm afraid, Chris. - Of me? - Not of you, of what we're doing. Love is the source and essence of life. You don't have to be afraid. You're right, it's life... Even if it should cost me my life. Finally. You're having fun, apparently? - Who says? - They say. - Then perhaps it's true. And while you're having fun at our expense, did you find anything out? Nothing interesting. Right. Meanwhile we risk paying out a million dollars. In principle, I'm inclined to reject the hypothesis of a... robbery that turned into a murder. - Really?. - Yes. - The police have already made that statement. Rather, we can say that it's predicated on my theory of blackmail. Really? Blackmail? I'd never have thought of that. But, of course, I don't have your experience. Blackmail, my foot. Theories have nothing to do with the company. It's the heirs. They're all we're interested in. Is that clear, Chris? Don't take it out on him, you chose him. You're right; you would have been much more suitable, as in the Utzinger Case. Quiet, you two. Since he was hired, Chris has successfully solved every case we've given him. Whereas you, Martin, with the Utzinger case... Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. I know you've risked your life at times. You know, Martin, you should practice your jumps more. Well, what are you going to do? Get to the source, I must get much closer to the Wanterburgers... - Yes? How? - As a welcome guest. I'm happy to have you with us, Chris. Let's hope your mother and sister share your enthusiasm. You can be sure of that. You should smile more often; it could disarm an army. That's funny - a few days ago, my father said the same thing while driving along here. You know, he bought a life policy the day he was killed. I keep thinking about this strange coincidence. Perhaps he believed he was in danger. Or he was going to die. Look out. Well done, little sister, you were quick about it... and smart. - Very smart; a man in the house is always useful. Aren't you going to introduce us? You're more than capable of doing it yourself. My name's Barbara, and I belong to the harem. Christopher Buyer. And who is the Maharaja? He's dead. Would you like to replace him? Does he bite? - Come on. - Don't be selfish. G?nter, take care of the horse, and put the car in the garage. Why don't you go and look for her? What were you doing in there? They're putting all the secrets in order for mother. Nobody's been allowed to enter that room since father died. Bruno, get the luggage. Silvia, Mr. Buyer's will be staying in the room overlooking the pergola. Why not the one overlooking the veranda? It's the most accessible. Do as I say. Anyway, it's pointless, I'll always a place in his diary. Isn't that right, Chris? I need a new one, the one I have is already full. Hard worker. Well... enjoy yourselves. Your mother? Yes, it was a heavy blow for her. She can't get over it. I see, I see. No, Mr Buyer... The dining room is here. So, Maharaja, what do you think of the harem? You only have to choose. The pheasant's delicious, isn't it, Chris? My little sister... hypocritical as usual. This pheasant is inedible. - I'm sorry you don't like it. I prepared it the same way as usual.. - Exactly. There is meat, miss. You know, I got you a diary. It's empty... But I warn you: I take up a lot of pages. I don't doubt it. Will you let him eat in peace? By 'peace', you mean of course, eternal rest, like father's enjoying. - Enough, Barbara, go to your room. - Alone? - Stop it. You're going too far. And you? I heard the insurance policy father bought has thrown suspicion on his heirs. And aren't we the heirs? As you know, dear, I've always lived in this boring house... because that's what father wanted. Mother has never left the house. The only one that goes back and forth, under the guise of medical examinations, is you. You were in town that day... And you killed him, Catherine. Take her to her room. The Melodrama of the Wanterburgers. End of Second Act. You had to find a man now. You must avoid certain indiscretions. And now... he's punishing you. Forgive her, Johannes, you know she's always been weak and selfish. But she didn't kill you. It wasn't her. Poor mother. She still believes in fairy tales. She'll soon recover, you'll see. - What is it? - Nothing... she's been spoiled and pampered, because she's the youngest. She got everything she wanted. You mean to stay here and be her nanny? If you get bored, my room's across the hall. Get off me. Leave me alone, animal, leave me. Go away. This is the secret room no one can enter. It was my husband's study. It's a sort of sanctuary for me. And here is his portrait. Like it? I would have preferred Picasso to have done it, but then nobody would have recognised him. I can only agree with you, Madame. He was an extraordinary man. - For me, it's as if he were still alive. - Yes, of course. I understand completely. And this is Inspector Huber, from the Homicide Squad. - Is he part of the furniture? - I'm beginning to think so. It's the fourth time he's been here to rummage through Johannes' papers. - Find anything, Inspector? - Not here. May I introduce a friend of the family? Mr Christopher Buyer. - About those phone calls... - Again. What more can I tell you? My husband received them, they were definitely business calls. - Calls that left him concerned? - Perhaps. Business never runs smoothly. Can you tell me anything about the caller's voice? I never answer the phone. it was always my husband, or the servants. - Tell me about the last phone call. - I told you everything I know. I happened to be passing, the door was open... - What did you husband say? - Nothing, he was just listening. Then he put down the receiver, he saw me... and he said that... that he to go into town urgently. - And then? - He never came back. The facts speak for themselves. A man like your husband wouldn't go into a Tunnel of Horrors at an amusement park... with 600,000 dollars, unless he had a grave reason to do so. Are you trying to suggest that it was blackmail? Seeing as how, in the space of just a few months... he had liquidated almost all of his assets... making large withdrawals from the bank. - These statements prove it. - You mean... That the estate of the deceased Mr Wanterburger, as is made clear in these documents... is reduced to just this house, and a few other small properties. Aside from the money from his insurance policy, of course. Signed on the very same day of his death. This allows us to establish, Madame, that it's certain your husband knew he was in danger. And, being concerned, he made sure he left his family a large sum... at the expense of a generous insurance company. Always getting under my feet, Buyer? I admire that gentle and delicate way you give out certain news, Inspector. The hypothesis of blackmail goes against the interests of your company? Not necessarily, Inspector. I didn't say that. - Well, Doctor? - Unfortunately, it's more serious than usual. Her condition, as you know, does not allow her to suffer violent emotions. - Some things cannot be avoided. - I'm the doctor, not the tutor. Sorry to be blunt, but for the sake of Katherine's life... I must remind you that any emotion too strong or novel can be fatal. - It's done now, so... - I know, but it would not be good to repeat the experience. I have given her a tranquilliser to help her sleep. Keep giving her the usual medicine, and keep me informed. Doctor, what's wrong with Katherine? - She's had a heart defect since birth. - In other words? In other words, Mr. Buyer, you should forget her. Poor Chris. What now? Don't worry, she'll recover. Why don't we go for a horse ride? I'll show you the land. - You ride well, Maharaja. - Did you doubt it? - Not at all. - You like the estate? - Yes, your father had good taste. - It's true, poor Joy. - Joy? - Yes, my father. I called him so in moments of intimacy. Are you surprised? He seemed to have a tough character, like mine, but in the end he was soft. He had just one fixation: he kept his family locked up in the house. Tell me, what do you really know about the death of your father? I think I know who killed him. - You have a clue? - Something more... What will you give me if I tell you? I'll be waiting here tonight, and then you'll know everything. I love you so much. It would be better for Katherine if she were alone, Mr Buyer. The day before he was killed, dad lost this. There's nothing written on it. And here? It says... "Do not touch." You don't know how to read, Maharaja. Hurry up. These photographers are always in the way. Thank goodness you were here. She's got something in her hand. It's a button from G?nter's jacket. You two. Quickly. Find that mute... The stable boy. That's enough, get out of here. You've taken enough. These ceremonies kill me. Hurry, let's go. - That man... It's him. - Who? What man are you talking about? It's him, I recognise him. He was at the reception. - But who is it? - He was watching me at the park. He's followed me for days. Let's follow him. There he is. We've lost him. Why did you leave me? I can't live without you. Shall we dance? Like this? Again? Barbara's not here anymore. What are you doing there? Why don't you come in? This is my sanctuary. Nobody's allowed in here at night, but I'll make an exception. Please come in. Johannes... Johannes, this is Mr. Buyer. And this is Katherine... you know her. Will you have a drink with me? Let's drink to the health of Barbara. Here. Now for mine. To Barbara. What's going on? It's probably just the fuse. - What should we do? - We'll put her in her room when the lights come back on. Don't worry: your mother's a strong woman, she'll get over it. You'll see: tomorrow, she'll be fine. I just hope the lights come back on quickly. - Excuse me. - What's wrong, Bruno? I don't know. Silvia went down to check the fuses and hasn't come back. I'm going to see myself. - Poor Silvia, what happened. - At least we got him. Mr Buyer got him. He didn't have to look for him, though. But there's still another person that interests us: the one that killed your husband. I hope you're not expecting, Inspector, that Chris will find him, too. No, this is a case of blackmail, and that's not Mr Buyer's speciality. You're still insisting on that absurd story? My husband led a blameless life. Since 1947. But before that...? As you know, we were in South America. That's where my husband made his fortune. - And before that? - What are you getting at, Huber? At the end of the war, for various reasons, a lot of people left Germany. Some went to the Far East, some to Africa, and some to South America. People who had lost everything, and wanted to start a new life. Yes, but there were also people who had good reasons to disappear. We weren't able to discover anything about your husband's past, because he'd changed his name. And one changes one's name when one has something to hide. Besides, what do you know about Wanterburger before he went to South America? Not much, I'd guess. At that time you would have been little more than a child. Thank you for the compliment. You should get this repaired; it's dangerous. Why do you insist on the blackmail theory? It has to be something like that, unless you made up the phone call... No, it's true, Inspector: I remember it perfectly, too. - Did you hear that? - So what is the truth, Mrs Wanterburger? That your husband had long since decided to take out the life insurance? And on that day, either you, or one of your daughters, or all three of you together, conspired to kill him? It's not true. And now you are eliminating each other... to take possession of his assets and insurance? This man... The train leaves in an hour. I want to go and see Silvia's parents. Have you taken a statement? Let's take a look at it. Come, Katherine. - So, how do you feel? - Better, but it was a nasty shock. - What the Inspector said about your father? - No... Those horrible suspicions he has. It hurts me, even though I'm getting used to it. - Anything else? - That man, the police sergeant... - What about him? - He's the man who was always following me. - And then, instead... - Maybe it's a good thing. But then... who made those phone calls? - It's for you. - For me? Don't worry; it's not your mysterious caller, it's a woman. You've got away with it till now, Katherine... but how much longer can you hide the fact that you killed your father? You know the only thing left for you to do, don't you? No, you're wrong, our company has always respected its commitments. But before we pay out a million dollars, we must be convinced that the heirs... are something between a white swan, a crystal plate and a saint in paradise... - Got it? - But you mustn't interfere with the police investigation. - And who is? Have you evidence to prove what you say? - No. Not at this time. But it seems clear that this time, our interests are opposed. We want the guilty party, you want to save your dollars. I'm sorry, but you have us wrong, Inspector. We are also interested in the truth. That's why we put our best agent on the case. Because Chris is our best agent. Right, Mr Losel? Stop playing the victim. No, I will not suspend operations, Inspector. It was just a friendly request. I can't stop you from protecting your interests. And in the end you'll thank us, I'm sure. - You think so? - This wouldn't be the first time our investigators will have helped you. And Chris is ideal for this case... investigations with an erotic or sexual angle are his speciality. - By the way, any word from our hero recently? - No, blast it. I assume he's much too busy. Alright... Yes, I understand. - What did the doctor say? - Well, the usual stuff... That we have to let her sleep, and give her an injection when she wakes up. - He's not coming to see her? - He'll call tomorrow. No, stay here, Chris. I want to play a game with you. - A game, Madame? - Magda, Chris. Call me Magda. Let's see who's the first to finish their bottle. - What is it? - It's a medicine for dying. - And what happens to whomever loses? - Win. You must drink without thinking. It's only poison. Come on, drink. Finally a bit of peace... No police, no domestics, no Barbara. There's only Katherine, but she's asleep... and she's already destined to die. She always has been. Just like Barbara. While the real victim's myself, because the blame is mine. Let's drink. A toast to Johannes. If there was only a way to get him drunk... Maybe for a few hours I could get rid of him, too. And we could be alone, the two of us. Chris, you are so patient... so full of kindness... Adorable. Like he once was. When everything was different, then Barbara, Katherine, and then... the loneliness. You wouldn't sacrifice love for success. You'd forgive those who helped you, wouldn't you? Then let's drink... To Barbara. Think about it. I left... - I couldn't keep working there. - Well, you made the choice yourself. - But why did you marry him? - I thought he was my ticket out of here, to take me away from this place forever, but... it was even worse than before. Although at least I managed to put certain ideas into his head. I don't understand. You say that he's "in your hands", yet he continues to make you his servant. You don't understand, silly. You, my darling, only do one thing well. Let me think about a way to fix it. Tony will be rich, I promise. Come on, Chris, that's the last drink. You have to win. - Come on. - What are we drinking? - Poison. I told you. Come on, you mustn't stop. You have to completely empty the glass. - And if not? - If not... if not, you lose. You have to empty it without spilling a drop. Katherine's asleep. Let's see if she is. Not there. Who was that on the telephone? - Why are you out of bed? - What else can I do? Who called me on the phone? Whose voice was that? - What are you doing? - She's fallen asleep. Who called me on the phone? - What's the matter? - What did you make me drink? Are you ill? Where are you, Chris? What do you want from me, Johannes? You can't make me pay for your sins. The main culprit was you. I... at the time, I was a little girl. Yet I've already paid for it, with Katherine's illness... with years of terror and anguish, with the death of Barbara. What else should I suffer? What else do you want from me? Cheers, father. Humanity will never know the debt I am owed... I eliminated you, one of the most notorious war criminals... and Magda, your accomplice... and that degenerate daughter of yours, Barbara. I always wondered why you didn't kill us with your own hands, mother and me... preferring instead to use a bomb. Did you hope to get away with it? Or so that your hands would stay clean? My hands are also clean. Magda, I didn't touch; Barbara, I didn't kill... And even you did not die by my hands, did you, father? I squeezed you dry, that's for sure: all the money you'd used to buy your new respectability. And I deserved it. It took a lot of patience to track you down... and force you to have to buy a life policy from me. Too bad that the money will never be collected now. A pity. When you chose the money and youth of Magda... over the poor wife and son you thought you had got rid of... I bet you never thought that one day, that child would become your only heir. But I've decided to renounce the right to claim on your insurance. And Katherine? Well, Katherine's going to die. Correct, Katherine? It was you... you're the one who made those phone calls. - And all the while pretending to love me, to protect me. - Yes, that's right. It was just a trick to get me to invite you here, so you could destroy my family. And I was in love with you, like a fool. I'm sorry, dear. - Like a fool... - Listen, Katherine. Poor Katherine... I told you, father, that I have "clean hands". I even loaded the gun with blanks. The excitement was too much for her. You can't blame me. - It's done. - What is this? - Your share. - What does that mean? - That this is where we part. No, Chris, I want more than this. I didn't kill for this pittance. What do you want? To be presented to the queen? I've always told you, Chris: don't underestimate me. She's disappeared. This way, perhaps. Go and warn my men. Cover the exits. Come. Over there. There's an open gate. - Ursy was his wife. - What?. How is it possible that Chris had married... a serving girl? He needed an accomplice who would kill the old man. It was the easiest way to obtain one. A woman who was greedy but... also very ambitious. When he tried to get rid of her with a small bribe, she killed him to take it all. - Incredible. - No, in fact, predictable... Chris thought a great deal of himself, and so he always underestimated others. Would you explain why you had assigned two investigators to the case? Well, he did it on his own initiative. You had suspicions about your colleague? No, I just had to prove something to someone. I've always said that Martin is our best agent. Yeah, but maybe this massacre could have been avoided... By the time I caught on to Chris, it was too late, but I've told you as soon as I could. Of course... And you saved a million dollars.
