I see even when I sleep. Hey there, go! What is? Move! You fool! Dad, there's still time to go back. At your age I was already long since married. Do not you. - I had three battles. - All of you, of course, won. I'm not saying. I won only two. The third was undecided. - It is unfortunate that a tie. - Little cross? Little cross? Cross dear son, cross. I had to truce the king Goodthought - and promise him... - That when his only daughter grows up, your only son will marry her that the kingdoms will be joined not to ever give a reason for war. Enough! There is no place for joking! I don't feel like fun either. I've never seen her before. - You haven't been married yet, too. - A little bit of that too. - What if she is a bit ... - You will marry her regardless, - Because I gave my word. - A word of a man. - The King's word makes ... - What? - What? - Well, for example, say. With the crown that God has put on our head, put together an obligation on our royal shoulders. But, Daddy, you sound like a history lesson. Try a little civil. - Seriously. - Stop arguing! - Dad ... - I told you already! - Please, I just ... Well, if it is so ... Prrrrr! Wait! No tricks! Two go with him! Go away! We are going. We are going! So do something! Well, what is it? - Search! Find! Bring! - Two riders on the right, two on the left! Search neighbourhood! Scour the forest! In the name of our king Goodthought we welcome you in our kingdom. King Henry accept our escort. With pleasure but unfortunately we have a lunch break. We get on the road as soon as my son, the prince, joins us. - He got a bit late. - For health reasons. Yes. Perhaps I could familiarise your majesty with the program, we carefully prepared. The first point of the celebrations the execution. Stop! Wait! Holy cow! Ha ha ha. Do you do that? Laughing at tired travellers? He is thirsty. No big deal. It just happens to be an older type, but for that consumption gives adequate performance. Where to go? Where to go? - Out. - It's a pity, I go inside. Oh, stop! But not this way! Look, I won't tell the king that you eat his unripe apples and you won't tell that I entered his garden, ok? - Let me go. - No! - Ouch! - Ouch, ouch, ouch ... - I didn't mean to. Ouch, ouch. You deceiver, you must not go! I'll tell them! I know an old garden There is a silky grass there The door locks five times And I dream about it There lived a beautiful princess She has tanned skin Only I know how sweet So do not be a fool, sit down! Nanananananá ... - Nanananananá ... - Nanananananá ... - In this garden there is also A well with black grille And old willow over the water Reflecting on the surface The pond with a wooden boat Waiting for us two Come and play with echo And sing what I do Nanananananá ... - Nanananananá ... - Nanananananá ... - If you don't tell me immediately, who you are, I will tip you! Where are the windows of your princess? There. Hihi. Beware, it is dry! Don't give me advice! I know everything! Help! Come on! Fast! He is drowning! Were you worried about me? Sure. Who is going to hang won't drown. - What are you doing in the royal garden? - Come on, come on. Do not touch! I on my own. Very funny! bring a man into trouble and then laugh. Wow! His Royal Grace Goodthought, known as Merry! Long live the king! Long live the king! Long live the king! Long live the king... - We don't know why there were delayed. - Let's wait. Long live the king! - You're lucky. He made a place for you. - It did not have to be. - Turn around! - Turn around! I won't make it. We need to start. We are an hour late already. We king Goodthought, known as Merry, state in accordance with the law: Anyone not brewing beer from proper and honest ingredients, Which are hops and malt, but rather from weeds and wormwood repugnant potion prepares and gives as an honest drink, each such prankster will be executed. - Kokoška! - Let Kokoška speak! We want Kokoška! Farther will read the highest royal joker, Kokoška of Kokořín. Kokoška! Great! T ... that is why the ... the innkeeper J ... Janek is gi ... given to executioner. Just a m ... m ... moment! Just a m ... m ... moment! At ... at the ... at the occasion o ... of the Princess e ... engagement the convict is a ... awarded ... a p ... p ... pardon. Long live the king! Glory! Trousers! How long shall I wait? Why did you want to know where are the windows of our princess? Come out, do you know, how deep is it? So why did you want to know where are the windows of our princess? So that I could have a look, what does she look like. - But you were singing about her. - The song belonged to you. Who are you? - Right now a prisoner. And you? - You can guess three times. Isn't your farther by any chance the jailer? Getting warmer. Perhaps chief jailer? Highest jailer. - Where's the princess? - Somewhere outside. And when will she be back? I have enough! From morning nothing works. At 10:00 am arrival of his royal highness and heir to the throne. It's almost twelve and Henry and Prince nowhere. Now even the gala dinner is in jeopardy. I am supposed to have engagement speech. I have not even read it and I should ... And I should be able to stutter it. Ro... Ro... Royal ... High... I am getting sick of it. Keep hitting the ground! I have no idea how our King can still laugh about it. But you know, but you know, but you know. They're here. Ss ... pants! Princess! Where is the princess? Kokoška! - I... I... I... - You do not know? Where is she? Where did she go? - I... I... - Talk and don't stutter! I don't know. Your Majesty, she went to change. The only person who knows something here. - Nanny, button up! - Yes, yes! - King! - King! - Great little silhouette! - Excellent! Where is the prince? - He fell ill. - Really? What a doubt about the veracity of the king's words? - I mean, if it was not serious. - Do not worry, I already cure him. - Who's there? - Here X. Do not say here when you're there. We can not forget that we are each on the other side of the line. - Clear? - Clear. However, under these circumstances, we can not go against each other, but rather what? - Stick together. - Yeah, yeah. Stick together. - But why? - Because the wedding must not take place. That would be the end of us. - Thankfully, the prince fell ill. - Didn't fall ill, escaped! - Mistake. - Not a mistake. - He escaped because he doesn't want to merry her. - Our king must not know this. On the contrary! He must! - But she does not want him either. - How do you know? - I do not know, I saw something. - What did you see? She goes visiting some destitute man into the dungeon and also she is mending his trousers. Is there someone with you? - And what is there rustling? - I rub my hands with glee. I see! - Ouch! For what? - Because one plus one is two. - It's okay, right? - Big lie and big coincidence. When someone says that the prince fell ill, and a youngster shows up here, who is most interested in the princess I can calculate that ... - Well I therefore admit. - I know everything. Prince sent you here. - Ouch! - What? It doesn't work for ages. You're a born psychic, But you probably won't become a seamstress. When you know everything, so tell me: Why would Prince send me here? Not to buy a pig in a poke and it offends me. But the smartass. I'm not a pig! - Well, not really. - I'm a princess. Tell your cautious master, I won't marry him. Without a doubt. Never! And look at me carefully, so you can tell him how I look. Count on it. I'll paint your picture accurately. Wait! What are you going to say? So, first: You have a slight squint, But it is not noticeable in profile. Second:you are a bit snobbish, right? The figure is quite passable, anyway the clothes can make miracles. I wouldn't talk about waist, because it simply does not exist. And legs ... Fortunately, we cannot see. Oh sorry, for those I have the highest admiration:Oh. You rascal, why don't you tell him the truth? If I told him only half the truth, he would come in no time, and now that I met you, ... I would ... hate to see that. - Did it hurt much? - Depends where. - It did not belong to you. - He has only a little hope, right? None whatsoever. I do not want him, even if he was the only prince in the world. So give him another one. No. Don't ask that from me. I won't deliver this message. I'll in fact have to give it back. It did not belong to him, you know? Enough. Not even the royal daughter can make debt that she cannot repay. One plus one is two, although, But that's not a couple. - You don't want prince and you cannot marry me. - Why? Do not forget that with a crown, which God has put on your pretty head, he put obligations on your tender ... loins. How would you introduce me? Dear Papa, this guy I met in jail. His cow is waiting outside the park, but otherwise he is perfect. I want to see your father's blessings. It happens Only in the girls' romances. Although, now I remember, there was once one, and she did it. But it was just a fairy tale. - Do I know her? - Who? That girl I mentioned? - No, that story. - Of course. The entire city is covered with black fabric, the king is troubled - Because his beloved daughter is ... - Sad Princess! - This is it! - But to do it, do you know? You'll see how I handle it. I'll be crazy sad princess. Sad as Monday, as Hamlet. Come on! Give me painter paints of all kinds I'll paint a rainbow in the clouds Tell me poets, how to compose a verse She probably loves me I'm not Leonardo, nor Michelangelo My palette is amateurish and poor But since I was kissed by the muse I decided to end the boredom With delight, with one stroke I paint a heart of love Because I love And I love and I paint ... - I never had the talent, I wasn't pampered with arts I always failed in drawing classes But today my soul is drawing on the walls Stick serves me instead of brushes With delight, with one stroke I paint a heart of love Because I love And I love ... - and I paint ... - ... and I love - and I paint Do not grieve for the prince, princess. Once I tell him about you, he will jump out of bed like a fish. - Healthy as a fish. - Like a carp. Carp, carp, carp, carp, carp ... Confidential Report. - We just got word that the prince ... - Later! ... Kokoška! Do something! Hop! Hopla! Hop! Hop! Hello! Hello? Are you sleeping? I can not sleep. I keep thinking that your boy. Does he have a doctor? Three. Oh ... three. And what about temperature? Did you measured his temperature? I'll measure him. As soon as he shows up. I want to say as soon as he recovers. Especially that he isn't unwell for too long. Most importantly. Good night. Night ... night. You were worried, that your daughter was worried. We received reports that your Princess does not want our son! And we have received messages. Your son didn't fall ill. He escaped. From our daughter. - This is the end. - This is the end. But that would mean war. Why would mean? It does! War is war. It may end in different ways. If only we knew that we would win. Exactly! I would not think twice, too. - Henry! - Goodthought! Alo, Alo! What have you done, you hooligan? Like scribble on the wall? We recently painted. King Henry left that night. We retracted our word. The wedding is over, but ... But otherwise we broke pretty good. We are getting more familiar. Stop thinking about it. I don't think about it, daddy. We have enough salt, we don't need your tears. Don't sigh and eat! You look all green, what's wrong with you? Nothing. I'm okay, Daddy. My daughter, wait! My daughter, you hear? One would think, she would be happy, and yet ... Listen nanny, something is wrong with that girl. - When did she laugh last time? - I can not remember. - That would be the last straw. - What, your Royal Grace? That we, Goodthought Merry, in the end had ... - What, your Royal Grace? - The sad princess! Such a shame all around our family! Or ... or do you think, she is not sad? What? Um, is she, right? Oh no. That's what I always feared. - What shall we do? - Your Royal Grace can do anything. He is right. I am a king after all. Kokoška! Kokoška! What is it? Somebody's coming? No one. - What is in the well? - Nothing. Why? If someone came, we need to say the same thing. What we are doing? - Loitering. With good luck we stave off the wedding, danger persists. - We need to do more what? - Intrigue. - Ugh! - Steps in the common interest. - It's the same thing. - But it sounds better. We need to pique your king against our king. - He never gets offended. - You probably never did it cleverly enough. I've got it. You know what? Starting today, we must go smartly. Ball of wool! - Did she heard us? - Shh! Hey, hey ... sup! - She did not hear us. - Hm. - I'll need grassy green. - La couleur purpe- And two reds. And if not, so vermilion. Yeah? Oh, and a piece of string! To make lines. A ruler! Longer. I will not lock, I'll be back in no time. And we start from the very beginning. Haha! Cheche! Chichi! Haha! Cheche! Chichi! We'll go through a basic lesson. It should be understood, what the joke is about, and thereby deduce, what to laugh about. And what follows? What? Well? Cheerful ... what? Merry l-a-u-g... h. Correctly! Attention! Get started! Wait, not yet! Laugh until then. Haha! Chocho! Chichi! This is wilful, daughter! Forgive me, father, but I can not laugh when I'm not merry. That we often are not either, daughter. But every trade has its obligations. Ruler must smile meet joyous future. - I order you ... - I will not laugh at every bullshit! Bullshit? This is a classic, daughter! Classics! They must be all laughing! Tell brightest princess our supreme will. Until then, that she is to laugh, we give her a strict house arrest! This applies to all! I'm ordering a laugh! Royal jingle! Jechecheché ... - Princess is on a hunger strike. We were afraid your Royal Grace would be... - Saddened. - And so it rather ... Tear falls off the face and I ask Why me, though so young, I have a heartache Why does my wine tastes like clay and henbane Why is it that I'm so sad and there is a shadow in my soul The piano should play in minor and black crape should wave In my chamber sound a church choir Why am I still chilly and cold by the unease And why do I wake up crying, when I should sleep in the morning And sleep Who cures my grief Who puts dressing on my pain Nobody else surpasses mine desperate cry Nobody else surpasses my cry That my sad cry Why are you learned? Well why, tell me why? When my desperate cry doesn't change into laughter When my cry doesn't change into laughter That my sad cry Uh-oh, my God, My God in heaven Already dreading the sadness I do not know, as I say, I'll probably cry myself to death That's not what I wanted, my daughter. When it's not from the heart, you do not have to laugh. I'll handle it! I am a king after all. Throughout the kingdom, under penalty of twenty-five hits with a sticks, Laughing is prohibited! Dismiss! Well, it happened. Come on! Come, come, come. Royal Grace, the laws announced by your royal highness, do not apply to your royal Grace personally. Please. That would soon finish off our royal command. Personally. Come on! Let's plot, let's scheme, usual and unusual- Let's plot, let's scheme, perhaps conspiring works out We will plot royally Let's plot, let's scheme, machinations get people swayed Let's plot, let's scheme, Speculate, intrigue Nothing is better than a proper plot Psst! She's looking for the prisoner, but we know and we will have it our way Then I have to disagree, we are going to support it We will manoeuvre her into our nets and will continue plotting We will manoeuvre her into our nets and will continue plotting We will manoeuvre her into our nets and will continue plotting - I do some stretching after work. - And what about the blood? That is vermilion. Come, come look! The place looks much better now. - A lot. - I would not want to leave. - Who knows if you'll get out of here. - Something blew up? What did the king in that fairy tale do? What did he do... You know that, right? He declared:Half of kingdom and the princess, who makes her laugh. Our dad did it backwards. - Half princess and the whole kingdom? - No, he forbade laughter. Oops. Have he read it? Ypsilon! It must be encouraged, it must be supported ... - Dolt! It's our prince! - This jerk? - Yeah. It's all right. - Do you know what time it is? - I am... Here it is not right, but not against the law either. You already know what happened? Well, tell me, did it work? - It seems that there is a lot of fun here. - To avoid a tavern fun! Take place. I am Martin, Smiley they call me. What? By chance you're right. Here, the innkeeper was in trouble, because he cooks plonk. What do you say. They don't understand. First taste yourself. Hail the king! Cheers! Long live! You know the last joke about the king? - I do not know. - Really. And you? I have no memory for jokes. Here in, and there out. Do you know why the king has at the castle so many guards? Do you know? So that they don't steel him from us. Good, huh? Twenty-five! For what? If I knew who you were, so I would keep quiet! Twenty-five is not for telling jokes about king, but for laughing. It's not allowed! Great, huh? I can hear! That goes for everyone! When you're done, Martin beats you! - Twenty-five, too! - Merci- You give me 25, I should give you 25, Delete it and we're even. Ouch! Ouch ... Princess! Come here! What are you doing there? Come here, quick! Come on! I remember many kings declarations, but this is the best ... Ouch! Imbecile! It hurts! This is it! Let's celebrate! Innkeeper, roll out barrels! Roll out barrels Roll out barrels of beer Six! We have overdone it a little. But we laughed a lot, so much that everything hurts. - Yeah, Mr. King, laughter is a bugger. - I didn't have such a good time for long time. - But only after you lifted the ban on laughter. - I know. You think I do not remember anything. - Where did we go next? - Nowhere. Where would we go? Then you sent Katya for heralds and let them publicise it. That too you don't know? What do you mean, too? I know all things that happen. - It is good. What is it? - Crackling. So this is crackling! And why don't we sometimes have it at the king's table? It's all pheasant, and ala pheasant and ... And what about the people, when it went public? Look out the window, What it had done with the nation. Good heavens! What did I actually declared? Half the kingdom and the princess for who makes her laugh. You thought about it when you read fairy tales, that you found in the bathroom stall. - Why do you think I'm here? - Oh no! - Oh yeah! - You would make princess ... Laugh. I will be a great son in law. Walk a little. That's awful. I could not have declared that with common sense. Or there were missing pages. Is it in those fairy tales like that literally? Every child knows it ... Half the kingdom and the hand of the princess, if so. And if not, well ... Correctly! So it is. - But it wasn't declared. - So it will be. - Get it declared! - I just pick the bone. Just go ahead, Mr. King will wait until you pick your bone. And give me a bit too! A good one! - And get it declared! - Oui! Dear, princess, Magic wand. Esteemed, our pri ... Close the door. Esteemed, our princess, let ... Close the door! - With me you don't have to act sad. - I have disappeared. You are guilty of it yourself. And now one of the comedians will make you laugh, - And you'll have to marry him. - I'd rather jump out of the window! We should rather do something, so that your laugh ... ... stops. - Be that as it may, so far he is on ice. - Who? - Prince. He went to slide? When I say on ice I think over there. On the stretcher. Should we had him taken out of the castle straight at night? The gate was closed. We will wait until the mob disperses, and then remove him. Why should we bother with him, when she does not want him? So you think she visited the prince in the prison because he did not want him? - She went for the latter. - For what latter? - There is only one. - Two! The prince and tatterdemalion. She loves tatterdemalion, and doesn't want prince. Tatterdemalion and the prince are one! Two! - She told him that she will never marry the prince. - Who? - Tatterdemalion. - She acts sad, so she could merry ... - Who? Prince no, she's angry at him. I do not know how anyone can not understand such a simple thing. - Come get him! - Kindly allow ... - Space! - Stretcher for a princess! Out of the way! You would not believe how heavy it gets. And that was empty. - Most importantly, we're here. Who had that idea? - You. But do not say hop, we're not at the princess' yet. Were it not for the stretcher, We would be waiting in the queue, - And we wouldn't get the princess. - And this way we are the first! That's the point, who's first. I go first, then the stretcher, Then a long gap and then you. - For everyone to know! - They are declaring something! Listen to the add-on to the declaration of our king- Who comes, but doesn't make our princess laugh will lose his head I've heard! No hesitation! Stretcher and let's go quickly! Who's first? And who's ne ... ne ... next? Do not push! Move into the car! You can see that the gentleman is sitting here! Have you a ... a ... agreed? So who wi ... wi ... What am I doing? Next! - Can you hear that? - Would you have anything against it, - If I go first? - With pleasure! Please! And would you mind if I make princess laugh? We are rather concerned, that you don't look like you would. I hope you known the conditions, young man. First, tell me who you are. Name, status, residence ... well! Princess knows me well. My prince! Royal Grace, I have the honour to introduce to you ... Prince Wenceslas, the only son of King Henry The just. Come here, my little boy! You had made us worry. Where have you been? Kokoška! Send messengers ... I got it from you. Send messengers ... Wait, you don't know where! - Send messengers ... - Ki ... ki ... ki ... To King Henry. Wait, you don't know what! Dear Henry The just, stop. Son is found, stop. Set out, stop. No, it would be expensive. Start again. - I ... I ... I do not ... I do not write anything. - Well, then forget it. In short, ask him to come, stop! No beating around the bush, right? - What are you waiting for? - You said stop and I ... I ... Are you going already? My children, I'm so happy! What's that face? Do not behave like a widow, when you're the bride. Give him a kiss and smile. What? How? Why? Of course, otherwise we would have this prince put ... Now you have to laugh. This is serious stuff. Of course, father, just when he makes me laugh. Please prince. It can not be forced. I didn't make you laugh, at least I made you weep. Do you think I cry for you? That would make me laugh. Grab me, minions! Done. Ne ... ne ... ne ... next! Nothing! Enough of this comedy, daddy. E ... end of the contest. - Why? - Again protectionism. - Amateur and takes the princess from us. - Perhaps you wanted to win? - The courtyard is empty. - They left. Packed, they fled when they saw that I am here. - It's the end. - Stretcher! Who is going to carry them for you? - Yes please. - Please, yes. Here is eagle, here is eagle! Do you copy? From now on we are again each on the other side of the line. - Clear? Over. - Clear, I understand. Over. - Exiting. Peace ... - Hurray! No hurray! Destruction! Destruction! Destruction! Go! Come on! Scoundrel! Jesus, forgive me, it did not belong to you. Did it hurt much? Get your belongings, and disappear. Wait! It looks like sacking. No execution? To my knowledge, I lost my young hot head. You made me laugh, you not even know it. But this changes the situation. I've won half the kingdom and the whole princess. Put me down! I'll never forgive you! Lying to me like that! I am pretending to be his sad princess and the gentleman is amused, How I love him. - How I hate you! - Helen, wait! My darling... Helen? - What, my little prince? - Now you are mine, the only one. - I do not know. - I do. - I don't. - I do. - I don't. I already know, I know I already know what it all means I know it, I know Why am I happy and blissful I already know, I know I already know what love is like a beam I know it, I know I already know how it's good to have you For us, the blue of the sky is falling Anything can happen today I like loving you I like loving you I already know, I know I already know what love is like a beam I know it, I know I already know how it's good to have you Come, come, come! How can we escape from prison? - Hardly. - With a goodwill anything can be done. - What about digging? - Seven-meter wall? On the rock? Did you read Monte Cristo? Or pry bars. It is obvious you were never in prison. What if someone bribed the jailer? - N'existe pas! - Pourquoi? - What? I lose my job. How did you make it to be the executioner with such intelligence? - Do you understand what mess I am in? - I do not know. - Oh. Can I cancel my royal word? I can not. Can I execute the son of King Henry? - Why not? - I can not. It is not possible. I can do nothing. And you have the key from this tangled situation. - Me? - Hm. Hm ... - So you think ... - I do not think anything. You must think. I must not even think of it, what do you think. Je comprend... - - To arms! - To arms! Henry! Henry! King! You want to cut the head of our successor! For punishment and retaliation we will level your kingdom! On behalf of the king we accept the war. To the last man! To arms! To arms! To arms! March! Hold on, Henry, don't be foolish. I imprisoned the prince, but I gave instruction to let him escape. - He'll be here any moment. - Let's wait then. But only for a time. Until the clock turns over. Now you are cuddly, right? And you wanted to have me beheaded. It's just because of the people. We have banned tournaments. Forbidden... And why? Every time someone broke his leg or poked his eye. - Dad can not see blood. - Wow, here I am marrying! Daddy can not see blood, so he organizes executions. Organized but not held. We give mercy to everyone. Everything out! Everything will make white! - Shh! Get out! - You shall get out! In our country abroad prisoner gone, and you're still here! How can anyone be prince with such intelligence? - Véno! - Yes honey? Who is still dragging around? Lock up! That's an idea. Even in prison not one moment to myself. Pardon. What's he doing there? Go into the dungeon! Or no ... wait! Henry, Come, see for yourself! Please. Let's go! What are you playing at, you rascal? - What are you doing here? - Daughter! - We are in love, daddy. - We are in love, daddy. - Open up! - I can not, I don't have the key! Kokoška! My key! It is under the pillow in my bedroom. - What if they manage? - It's impossible. I'll never understand this. He flees from her, I can go crazy worrying where is he. - And then I'll find him with her in the dungeon. - It's nothing against the logic of my daughter. First, she rejects the guy we give her. Then she makes a sad princess so that she could marry whom she wants. And when she can have him, she doesn't want him, because it is not the one she wants. And she wants the one, who she did not want at all. What would you do now if we say no? I see! Now you are at wit's end. - So what would you do? - Do you want to see it? - Hm. Seriously? - Aren't they two fools? - Oh, please, we have time. - This is today's youth. - A dime a sense they have. - No responsibility. - Everything taken lightly. - Because of them the war almost broke out. - Ultimatum! - Kokoška! - Here! - Good God, he's here, too. - How do we get out? - Hardly. - Princess! You are here? Yippee! Bring a blacksmith, so we can get out! - Wouldn't it be... - Do not jump into my speech! ... better to unlock? - Typical female logic. - How, when we don't have the key? - Why didn't you say so? - Kvin. - Kvar. - Tri. - Du. - Unu. - Zero! - War. - Broke out. So stop it. Declare its end. - Can not, boy. - A war can not be stopped. - It can not be true. Reprove! - Take orders, you are kings! - It's too late. - Now generals are commanding. Left wing, infantry. Five thousand men ... sacrifice. Our riders on arc attacking the enemy from the rear and ... ... Destroy him! - Clear? - Clear! General X knows the only tactical manoeuvre. Sacrifice left wing. What are we going to do, gentlemen? We sacrifice right wing! Mistake, gentlemen. We sacrifice both wings. Ouch! Stop! Those your gunners are firing like mad! And yours are not like mad? - What would you like? - A little fire. I got wet tinder. We lie there in such a morass! Hey! - What are you doing, rascal? In war! - Mom says, We are afraid home alone. You have to come home now! Daddy, who is that man? - Don't fear him, it is the enemy. - Stop! Or I'll shoot! Oh, our princess! Our prince! Lads, we need your help. Hey, hey, hey ... Sss! Here, here, here ... And go! And go! It's a joy, right? They wanted to fight, le... le... let them fight! Until the e... end. Ring free! Go on! Go on! Go on! What shall we do? What shall we do? I think I know. Interpreters. I at your place, you at our place. What about languages? Not required. We speak the same language. But do not say a word! People did not figure it out yet. Not a word to anyone! Cheers! But I cannot marry him! - Why? - He's shorter than me! - Straighten up! - By that much! - You're exaggerating. And you didn't know that before? - He doesn't stay still for a moment. - You will marry him, regardless! - Look at daddy. - And I won't and won't! - Kokoška! Crown! - On the ... head. - Coronation! - Why don't you have heels? - But dad ... Now it's just right. I know one beautiful princess I know a prince, what quarrels I am lucky I found her And I want to love him I know the old park, the echoing Where is peace and tranquillity Who hasn't rheumatism in his knees You can go with us Nánánanananá ... - Moment, moment!
