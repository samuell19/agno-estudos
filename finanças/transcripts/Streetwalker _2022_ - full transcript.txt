Welcome, brethren. I am Father Isiah Russ. Of the Church of the Enchanted Saints. Today we will be speaking... of the inner turmoil that plagues us all. The deep-seated trauma of our lives. The only way to release yourself... from the trauma and ascend into the light... is to remember. There are two psyches. There is the divine psyche. And the conscious psyche. This meat. This flesh. This is not you. This is not-- this is not you! Within you there is the divine. Melding those is the only way you can ascend. Ascend and touch the pure and perfect being... that is above. Why don't you get some perfume before we meet up again? Excuse me? You need to get some perfume before we meet. How charming. Are you implying that I smell? Listen Ruby, I'm not saying that you smell bad. Or that you smell good, but... just, you smell like you've been with four other men tonight. I have been with four other men tonight. Exactly. I don't need to go home to the old ball and chain, smelling like four other filthy fucking bastards. Duffy, you are one of those filthy bastards. Listen, you gotta get this shit, it's called Rose Summer? It's what my wife uses. It's not Chanel... -but it'll mask the stench of-- -Stench? Odor? Whatever. Fuck you, Duffy. Not 'til you get that perfume, my dear. Ruby! -Zoey, hi! -Hi! How are you doing, baby? Oh, I'm just peachy. -That bad, huh? -Mm-hmm. Come here. Let's go out. No. I'm gonna call it a night. -Okay. -I'm going to bed. -Okay. Get home safely. -I will. Good night, Zoey! ...the colors... Medical strike continues, as the state seemingly ignores the pleas of hundreds, after major cuts from last quarter. Three of the four local hospitals are now temporarily closed due to lack of staff, leaving Metro West as the only operational facility. Unfortunately, it was left mid-renovation after those cuts, so many residents are filling in on a voluntary basis in the meantime.

What do you say, play a little hooky? You little cutie pie. Oh, baby. In my travels, through the globe... beyond and within. I was came upon by an angel. Who spoke to me of the truths. And these truths cannot be denied nor unproven. And they are thus... the spirits... the gods, the demons... everything you read about in the Bible... is from a cosmic war that's going on all around us. God is an extraterrestrial. And what we are not seeing... is that he's an interdimensional warrior that travels through time... and dimensions... to reach us. But our eyes are closed. We cannot see him. There is no way we can enter heaven. The only way we can ascend the spiritual plane, is by total and pure... What are you doing? Uh, n-- nothing. And become the perfect being... ...of spiritual and mental toughness. And at the top of the pyramid... there lies... It's for you. Hello. Okay. Thank you. I have to go. Someone's waiting for me. Hello, Ruby. Uh, hi. Did I frighten you? Yes. I'm-- I'm sure it's not the first time. I'm-- I'm sorry, do I know you? Not yet. Are you the one that's been waiting for me? Oh, yes. We've been waiting quite some time for you. We? Ruby! What the hell are you doing out here? I've been waiting for you in the room. I was just talking to-- He was here. He knew my name. -Who? -This-- this guy. Are you fucking with me right now? No, I'm serious. Right. Hey, did you get that perfume I asked you to get? What? Uh, yeah, I got it. -Rose Summer? -Yes Duffy. Rose Summer. Perfect. And I got that coke that you wanted. I did not ask for that. Well, yeah, well, I've got it. And we're going to do it tonight. Duffy. No. Listen, I come to you to do the shit that I'm not allowed to do at home. So tonight, we're going to do the shit that I'm not allowed to do at home. Come on, my wife would fucking kill me if she knew I was doing this shit. And she certainly wouldn't do any of it with me. So, I guess that leaves you. Ruby. I don't know. It's been a strange day already. You just need a little pick me up. Pay me double. Sure, that works. Fine. All right, that's what I'm talking about. Come here. Ruby! Ruby, wake up. Fuck! Fuck! Ruby! Ruby! God-- God fucking dammit! Wake up! Shit, shit, shit, shit. Can you hear me? You're at Metro West Hospital. You're very badly injured. You almost didn't make it. We were able to remove the rebar. It missed all your vital organs. There was some damage to your small intestine. You also have an orbital fracture in your face. We were able to remove all the grass shards, stitch you up and clean your wounds. It's gonna take a couple months to heal. It's going to be okay. But I think for now, I should probably let you get some rest and recover. Okay. Um, excuse me. Typical street whore. Probably got the shit kicked out of her by her pimp. Listen, bandage her up, get her out of here. Don't-- no special treatment. We don't need more of them on the street. Excuse me? What the fuck did you just say? I'm sorry, ma'am, this, uh-- this doesn't concern you. Actually, it fucking does. That's my fucking friend in there. Ma'am, visiting hours are over. And I suggest that you leave. You know, you look really familiar. I probably busted you before. Nah. That ain't it. I don't forget the pigs that bust me. I'll remember. Listen, just bandage her up, get her out of here. "Our Father... who art in cosmic heaven. Hallowed be thy astronomical name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done... as it is on this earthly plane." Hey, um, hi. Hi, uh, your-- your name's Roy, right? Yeah. Hi. Hi, I'm-- I'm Zoe. Um, I'm a friend of Ruby's. You know Ruby? "Lead us not... to dimensional... transformative... temptation." Okay, well, she's in there and she is hurt really bad, and they won't tell me anything. And there's this fucking cop, and he's being such a fucking prick, and they won't let me know if she's alive. They won't let me know if know she's dead. I just want to know that my friend is going to be okay, and I don't know anything. "Yours is the kingdom and the power... of glory. Forever and ever. Amen." Okay. It's okay. Hey, uh, I-- I work here. I-- I'm a nurse, uh, and if-- if Ruby's in there, I'll-- I'll find her. Okay? Uh, everything's gonna be all right. -All right? -Okay. Thank you. Who-- who are you? Oh. You're awake. I am Father Isiah Ross. Oh... I've seen you on TV. Yes? Are you a subscriber to my video series? No. Oh. Okay. That's okay. Are you in pain? My dear. Hmm... This should take the edge off... a bit. Anyway... what is your name, my child? Ruby. Do you believe... in the Lord Almighty, Ruby? I'm sorry. Why are you here? I have been sent... by the cosmic Father... to do his divine bidding. Something brought me to you. Because I knew... that you are in great pain and you needed... salvation. A savior. And here I am. Yeah, well... I think the doctors have that handled. Something haunts you. Am I right? Tell me what torments you, Ruby? Right now, it's you. You're tormenting me. I'm just here to help. Now... tell me, Ruby... how did you end up here? Horrible men put me here. Is that a fact? Yes. Fragile... pathetic egos. Just like yours. So... it's masculinity that traumatizes you. Tell me, Ruby, have you ever heard... the concept... of the conscious and the divine psyche? No. Well... it's... a little thing I picked up... through my divine travels... through this earthly dimension. You see... humans are of two separate minds. In one, the conscious. This holds our weakness. Our suffering... our trauma. And it keeps us... it clouds us... from moving past... and inheriting... the pure divine light. Reaching our full human potential. And then, there is the divine psyche. Like a perfect computer. And it's this earthly form... that keeps us, holds us back... from achieving unlimited power and potential. The only way... to combine these two... is to relive your trauma. Feel it again. Bear it. That's the only way... anyone can ascend. Do you understand, Ruby? No. It's okay. You will. I know you're a whore. Do you know, Ruby... what the book of Leviticus says about whores? No. It says they shall be burned to death. And as much... as I love a good cleansing by fire... I have great faith in my own healing techniques. Because even... a man of the cloth... must give in... to temptation. Good morning, kitty. Thank you for watching over me. How did we get home? Hmm? How long was I out for? Hello? Hey, it's Roy. Come on up. This happened on Tuesday? Yes. You were with me that night. Don't you think you would have noticed? I don't know. It wasn't covered with makeup or something? -You don't believe me? -It's not that. It's just that it doesn't make any sense. It's medically impossible. These wounds are completely healed. From the look of it, these scars could be years old. It's a miracle. That's what I've been trying to tell you. Something weird is going on, Roy. Something really weird. Ruby, do you believe in God? No. Not really. Well, if you ask me, there's only one explanation for this. It's a miracle from God. Hey, cute cat. Dear God. Or Lord. I don't know what to call you. But if you are real... if you are listening... maybe you could help me. Is this what I'm supposed to do? Why is this happening? Why is this happening to me? Is this a part of your plan? Am I supposed to understand this? Are you even listening? Please, God. Just show me. Give me some sort of sign. Who are you? I am. What do you want? We want you, Ruby. Why me? Have you ever experienced the sweet taste of someone else's blood? Oh, God. Help me. God cannot hear you. God does not love you. God doesn't even know you exist. Are you going to kill me? We do not want to kill you, Ruby. We cannot make you a martyr. If you were to die, these people would not care. They would simply see a dead harlot. Another young girl abused and forgotten by the patriarchy. And that does not fulfill our purpose. We need you, Ruby. You are one of us. Who? Calms the nerves... Good morning. And now, we have a very special video presentation for this city's number one whore. That's right, Ruby. We're looking at you. Tell 'em your name. Speak. Speak, pig. My name's Officer William Duffy. I don't know who these people are. I don't know what they want. - Piggy, piggy, piggy. - Please, help. Help me! Help! They want you dead, fucker. Fucker, fucking dead. Dead! Wow. Now, that's what I call a pig roast. Pick up. Hey, it's Ruby. Listen, do you still want to get out of here? Ruby, it's me, it's Roy. It's Roy. We got to go. We got to go. We gotta get out of here. So, you want to tell me what's going on? Have I completely lost my mind? Are you in some sort of trouble? It just doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah, I'm, uh, starting to feel the same way. Ruby, will you please, just tell me what the hell is going on? These-- these people... they're following me. Stalkers? No. Strangers. Only... they seem to know my name. Well, what do they want from you? Do-- do they want money? 'Cause I've-- I've got money. And you're more than welcome to-- to have it. There was something else in the room that night. What? In our room? I saw him. He was there. And then last night... he came to me again. I couldn't move. I tried. But it was as if... I was being held down by something. I could barely breathe. It felt like someone was sitting on my chest. And he just appeared. He came out of the shadows. My God. That's terrifying. It talked to me. It talked to you? He said they wanted me. He said that I was one of them. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Need you for what? - I don't know. - One of who? I don't know. But they killed Duffy. Who? Duffy. He was a client of mine. Oh, you mean that asshole cop? He was a client of yours? You knew him? Uh, kind of. I-- I knew-- I know his wife. She's a great doctor. Man, that guy's a real piece of work. Uh, I mean, no disrespect, but, like... sometimes you get what you deserve. She saved my life. No. He saved your life, Ruby. Now, don't do anything you're going to regret, Ruby. You know, this is a big opportunity for you. This could change your whole life. He can save you. He saved us all. He saved us, all right. You know, it's true what they say. He works in mysterious ways. And you may not understand it, but it's what's best. He's got all of our best interests in mind. It's scary. Growth is hard. You don't have a choice. So, our sweet little Ruby has returned. Your cunning attempt to escape us is so very disappointing. Why did you kill Duffy? It was our will that he should suffer. Besides, have you not entertained the notion yourself? Eliminating the thorn in your side? A pain that you're now quite familiar with? Sure, he was an asshole. But I wasn't going to kill him. Oh, Ruby. We simply released his spirit from this earthly plane. Where's Roy? There's no need to worry about Roy. He's in highly capable hands. So, what? You're going to kill him, too? That is yet to be decided. He didn't do anything. Consider him as collateral. You, Ruby, are our investment. You attract the transgressors, and we deal with them as we see fit. And what am I supposed to do? All you have to do is prevail. Your presence is our existence. And from us, your life receives a purpose. And what if I don't want to? Well, that would be unacceptable. Do you not understand, Ruby? We are your anti-saviors. Your anti-Christ, anti-heroes. And if you are not with us, then you are against us. Hey, uh, it's Roy. I'm not in right now, so just-- Hey, it's Ruby. Could you meet me somewhere? Let's go, boys. Thank you for meeting me here, Zoey. I didn't know where else to go. Oh, honey, I'm so worried about you. It's totally okay. I can't believe you're out of the hospital already. -Yeah. I can't either. -Come in. So, this is going to sound a little crazy, but I have to tell you what's been going on. Brothers, sisters... followers. There are demons among us. You can't see them... with these, these human eyes. For they travel through dimensions using gravitrons. You cannot sense them, but they are there! They are always there watching, tasting the... spit that comes from your mouth. Can I help you, brother? We have a... sermon happening here. Is there anything I can help you with? I just wanted to see where the magic was made. Well, now you've seen it. You can go. I'm sorry, my friends want to see where the magic is made, too. Come on. Hey, hey, hey, now. Uh, if this is about the councilman's daughter, I can assure you, we settled that out of court. Oh, no, no. We're friends of Ruby's. Oh, shit. So, who the fuck are these psychos? I've either lost my goddamn mind, or they really are some sadistic cult from hell. You think they're demons? I don't know. I don't really believe in that stuff. But you believe in hell. What if this is hell, Zoey? You're serious. Fuck. What if I really did die the other night? No, no. No, no. You're right here with me. I just don't know what to do, Zoey. Oh, okay. It's okay. -It's going to be okay. -I don't know what to do. It's going to be okay. All right. - Face down, on the bed, ladies. - What the fuck? Face down onto the fucking bed now. Dammit. - God! - Stay fucking still. Ruby? Some fucking friends you got, you know what I mean? Stay still. This will all be over. Don't fucking move. Don't fucking move. Fucking-- This ain't nothing personal, Ruby. It's just a little added security measure. Now, give me your wrist. Give me your wrist. Give me your fucking wrist right now. This will all be over soon. For you. There we go. Don't move. Be right back. Welcome, Ruby. Tonight, you are our master of ceremonies. Please, rise. Reveal our sacrifice. Crucify him. He must die for his sins. I can't. If you cannot punish your transgressor... then we will be forced to punish your allies. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh. This one didn't make it. What a shame. You sick fucks. You told me I didn't have to do anything. I lied. Now, unless you wish the same fate upon Roy, I suggest you obey us. Wonderful. Now, do you remember what he said on television the first time you saw him? No. Well, he recited quite a lovely passage about dismembering body parts that cause you to sin. No! I highly doubt that he will make it into heaven with those disgraceful genitals intact. I don't forgive you, Father. It's done. Now, let us go. Oh, Ruby. You can never leave. You are truly one of us. Then let Roy go. No. Roy is just as guilty as the rest. We had a deal. No, Ruby. You never even had a choice. Let us go. Let him go, God damn it. Ruby, I'm afraid you just don't understand. The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. Behold. I am making all things new. Though your beginning was insignificant, yet, your end shall increase greatly.
