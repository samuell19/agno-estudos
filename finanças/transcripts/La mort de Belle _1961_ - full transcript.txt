Hey! Hurry up. Yes? Is it you Stéphane? Christine? Hold on, I'll turn off my lathe. Yes? You're still working? I'll be finishing my lamp stand in 10 min. - Everything's fine there? - Yes. - Has Belle come home? - She just came in. Do you want to come play bridge with us? Not really. One of the cars could pick you up. I'd rather go to bed. As you wish. Don't wait for me, I'll come home late. Olivier and Marion just arrived. We're having a tournament. They intend to loose as usual and make us rich. I'm glad you're having fun, but I'll stay home. Come over, you lazy! You heard Daniel? What should I say? Stéphane, it's your beloved brother-in-law speaking on behalf of the family. You must join us! Are some shameful occupations holding you back? Nice try, dear Pinet. But my intentions are pure: turn a lamp stand and go to bed. Good night, then. I'll try to not wake you up. Lock the door, I have my keys. Have fun. I remember my schedule that night. I always feel anxious when I stop working. So I was dawdling in my office. I'm always reluctant to go to bed. I didn't check if there's light under Belle's door. Over the two months she lived with us I barely noticed her. I fell asleep immediately. I didn't hear Christine come home. I'm late. A typical Frenchman. Don't forget our rules! France and Swiss districts signed a peace treaty in 1452! Where's Belle? She went out last night. Her first class is at 10, she likes to sleep. You won last night? Of course! The Marions lost as usual. 31 francs, a fortune! Bravo! Bye, I'm late. Tell her it's my fault! M. Blanchon, your wife called, asked you return immediately. I just left her. What happened? She's fine, but insisted you come home right away. She said there's no need to panic. - I'm gonna call her. - She insisted you don't waste time. - Please inform the principal. - I already told him. What is it, doctor? Come in. Is Christine ill? Belle? An accident, Stéphane Are you sure you didn't go out last night? Certainly. Why? She's dead. Why? Beckmann is coming, he'll find out why. How did it happen? She was strangled. The doctor has already called the district attorney. Why not the police? Beckmann is a friend, he will help you. I'd better tell the principal I'll miss school today. I already called, he doesn't expect you. You told him? I said Belle had an accident without going into detail. The street will be busy, I'd better put the car in the garage. My little Christine. I've known you for so long, you are brave. Why were they looking at me? Why were we pretending to be calm? The death of this girl is tragic. Stéphane, what am I learning? Somebody was killed here? What terrible news! The doctor will tell you all. Doctor. Mrs Blanchon, I pay you my respects. This is my secretary. Ms Graf, take off your coat and start taking notes. Excuse us, Madame. Would you like some coffee, Ms Graf? Yes, please. Give me the inspector Dalcroze. Beckmann, yes. How are you, Georges? I'm at Stéphane Blanchon's. A professor at the International School. You know him? Somebody was murdered in his house. An 18-year-old American girl. She was strangled in her room. Her body was found this morning. No clue was found yet. I'll start the first questioning. We'll wait for you. Inspector Dalcroze and Sergeant Ruchet will be here shortly. I'll begin with some routine questions. Starting with the victim's name. I don't remember seeing her here. She came two months ago. Belle Shermann, S-H-E-R-M-A-N-N. - American? - Yes, with Russian roots. A relative of yours? No, she wasn't related to either of us. Her mother, Lauren Shermann is a close friend. We went to the same college. She wished that Belle could improve her French I proposed that she stay with us. - How old was she? - 18. Where are you going, pal? To get some tobacco. I need you for questioning. But it won't take long. Don't take it personally, Stéphane but I prefer you stay with us. The police and their experts are coming. You know how it is. Tests, pictures and all the frills. Nothing must be touched. All right. I'll smoke later. So you stayed home the whole evening? Absolutely. Why? I didn't feel like going out. Don't you play Bridge? - Sometimes. - You're a skilful player. I remember a tournament where you beat us all. You excelled yourself. Your wife called from the Simon's to join the tournament. I said I'd finish my work and go to bed. Were you standing there? I was in my study which is also my workshop. Remind me where it is. That's right. You answered the call here? There's another phone in my study. You heard nothing during the evening? No. - Did you come back in this room? - No. Did you see Belle Shermann coming home? Not until she came to my study. How long did she stay? She didn't enter. That's right, sorry. She stood in the doorway. It took a while before I noticed her. I hadn't heard her come. Did she tell you she was going to bed? I don't know, I couldn't hear anything. The lathe was covering her voice. I wanted to turn it off, but she was gone. She was returning from the movie theatre. What time was it? I have no idea. You didn't have your watch? I left it in my room when I changed my pants. You went upstairs to change? - Naturally. - Why? I had marked my students' papers and was going to work on the lathe which is messy. Was Belle in her room when you went upstairs? That was before she came home. How do you know she wasn't home? Don't be upset, Blanchon. Details counts in my job. I don't question your honesty but I must clarify what happened in this house. You're in your study correcting your student's papers. You go change clothes upstairs. Where was Belle at this moment? If he was at his lathe when she came, it means he changed before. Let him answer himself. She came to say goodnight. How long did it take? - Less than a minute. - Did she have a coat? I think so, and a dark scarf, but I'm not sure. Can you describe her handbag? No. You know who she went out with? Did she have a lover? All the young in our neighbourhood liked her very much. Was she dating somebody? I don't know. I guess she kept it secret. Actually, you hardly knew her. Only for two months. I know her mother more. It's not enough to know her daughter. Have you seen Belle today? Why are you asking me? You're turning the tables. You were the one out with her last night. You disapprove. You want the details? You'll certainly be the last I would ask. If I could... Stop ordering me around! Belle does as she pleases. Apparently, you don't have exclusive rights. - Which means? - Shut up, Philippe! Hold on, I'll take another one. I told you. You're in for a change with all this commotion. A little, yes. Can I go to my study to retrieve my tobacco? Earlier, I told him not to. Would you be kind enough to show me your study? Could you turn on the lathe? It's indeed quite hard to hear anything. It's your den. We all have one, with our favourite books and toys. There's a little boy in every man. But it must remain secret. I make scale models of planes. I must go, we still have work to do. You know nothing to help us? Last time I saw her, she was standing there, right where you are. She spoke to me I think she said "goodnight". Nothing unusual struck you? Nothing. You locked the front door before going to bed? I think so. Indeed, my wife told me on the phone she had her keys. Do you think somebody broke in? Maybe. We'll clarify this. What whisky do you drink normally? Black and White. It's my favourite brand. You drink it from this little bottle? Most of the time. It's unusual. An odd habit from my student years when I couldn't afford a whole bottle. A good reason to drink less. A personal trick. Does Ms Shermann drink whisky? Not that I know of. Ever shared a drink with her? Never. Either in your study or her bedroom? I said never. I don't play hide-and-seek, Mr Blanchon. We found this bottle in Ms Shermann's room. As you can see, it's empty. No whisky was spilled on the floor. It was all consumed. - You mean Belle...? - Probably. Straight from the bottle, the bathroom glass is clean. Pure whisky. That proves she was used to it. According to the blood test, she absorbed a large amount. Did you notice anything when she entered? No. Smelled drink on her breath? I didn't. Did she look or act strange? No. Did anything in her speech indicate that she was drunk? I couldn't hear her. That's right. I doubt she drank that night. Why? I don't know. She seemed to be sane and normal. One can look sane and normal, yet... You'll excuse me, I have things to do. Please, don't bother. Come, Stéphane. They left? The inspector and the doctor are gone. M Beckmann wants to see you. Sit down, Blanchon. My secretary will read your statements. I suppose you won't dispute your own words. When you went to your office to mark your student's papers You were wearing your present Gray suit. I specified this point to M Beckmann. You then went upstairs and changed clothes. Are these the pants you put on? Do you recognize them? Yes. So you were wearing these pants when Ms Shermann entered. I was wearing them when I saw her in the doorway. You can leave, M Ruchet. See you at 2pm in my office. Make it 3pm instead. Don't worry Blanchon, it's a mere formality. I'm asking you to think hard weigh the pros and cons and tell me in all honesty knowing that you'll have to attest to your words in court under oath. Will you confirm that at any moment last night, you went to another place than those you mentioned: namely your office, your bedroom, your bathroom, the kitchen, and of course, the living room that you had to cross? I confirm. Do you want to think about it for a few minutes. I see no point insisting. So explain Mr Blanchon how come we have proof of your presence if not in Ms Shermann's bedroom, at least in her bathroom? I remind you that to access the bathroom one needs to cross the bedroom. I'm all ears. I didn't enter her bedroom. And the bathroom? No. We have excellent reasons to believe the opposite. I repeat I entered neither her bedroom, nor her bathroom. No need to play tricks, Blanchon. The experts came today. In a hole between two tiles of a bathroom's corner they found traces of sawdust. It's the same type, the tests will confirm it as the same as collected in your office and on your pants. You might object that Ms Shermann could have gotten on her clothes some dust spread by the lathe. The officer who went with you to your studio stood where Ms Shermann was and asked you to switch on the lathe. We haven't found any sawdust on him. You still don't remember? No. We have all the time necessary. I remind you that you're a witness, not a defendant. You remember now? No. You admit you went to the bathroom. I didn't go there. Do you have an explanation for the sawdust? I didn't go to Bella's bathroom last night, but the night before. Her towel holder was broken. The cleaning lady can confirm. Mrs Anet, a phone call for you. Thanks, Mrs Simon. You're welcome. I'll close the door. M Beckmann speaking. Very well, Mrs Anet. My wife is doing well the children too. Yes, my little one recovered from his whooping cough. No relapse, we're careful. Listen Mrs Anet I need some specific information. When was the last time you paid a visit to the Blanchon's? Good. Could you tell me if that day Mr Blanchon was fixing...? Repairs, yes. I don't know. You're sure? In Ms Belle's bathroom? Thank you, Mrs Anet. Goodbye. At least this point has been clarified. Another one remains. The doctor is coming to check you up. I don't see any reason to hide it from you. Ms Shermann fought her murderer. We found blood under her nails. In all likelihood, her murderer has scratches. Come out, Mrs Graf. Goodbye, Mrs Blanchon. Goodbye, Blanchon. The doctor is coming? Why? They found blood under Belle's nails To make sure that... You believe I'm innocent, don't you? Be careful they could see us. They have other fish to fry than watch us by their window. We'll say the questioning took longer than expected. Let's have lunch at Auberge St-Maxima. M Beckmann, I suspect you have shameful thoughts. You'd make a good judge. I suspect you are right, Ms Graf. She's probably his mistress. Men are disgusting. I've never had a mistress. I knew Beckmann, his wife and children. They looked like a happy couple. All seemed so easy for others. Are you hungry? I didn't do the shopping. These cigars are disgusting and this girl and her cheap perfume soaking herself in it. Once done, we'll clean Belle's room with Mrs Anet's help. Her smell has been invading the house. You've been hostile to her since this morning. What a strange idea. No scratches no cuts. Why did I have to take all my clothes off? Her murderer might have been naked. Open your mouth More. Turn around. Where did you get this scar? From a camping stove that exploded. You can put your clothes on. Nothing, of course. If I had a scratch from shaving this morning? A test would show if your blood is from the murderer's type. And if it was...? Relax, nobody would hang you for that. The law is more complex than you think. Not everybody commits these kind of crimes. There are psychological factors to account for. Soon we'll know more. You barely knew Belle, didn't you? For about two months. What about your wife? Belle never meet us before. Have you noticed any weird conduct? You mean, about the whisky? Beckmann told you? Belle drank half a bottle. She couldn't have been forced to or tricked into drinking. We never saw her drink. Nothing struck you in her behaviour? Why was he smiling? Did he know something I didn't? You don't get it? I'm afraid not. For you, she was a girl like any other. The daughter of my wife's friend. She never told you secrets? No. You never asked her? No. She never insisted on coming to your office when your wife was away? That never happened. No offence meant, I believe you. Besides, it's none of my business. Goodbye, dear Christine. I return your husband in excellent shape. - Goodbye doctor. - Goodbye Stéphane. You're turning off the lights? I think we'd better go to bed. As usual, I picked up one of my history books. It's funny I knew everything about a king's mistress, dead centuries ago, but I couldn't tell the eye colour of a young lady who changed my life. Why did I never look at Belle? Have I ever looked at Christine? She was 26 when we married. We taught at the same school. Maybe she was desirable then. I never really thought about it. She was gentle and calm. I vaguely felt I had to marry her to keep my world in shape like my mom would like me to. We lived side by side quietly, without any trouble. I lived without making any waves. Why do you think she was killed? I don't want to know. I want to quickly forget her and this terrible event. I will never be able to forget. We should've protected her better. I'll forever blame myself for letting her stay here. Some people cannot be protected against themselves. I fear learning things about her that will shock me. Try to forget about all this. I can't read, I'll try to sleep. Good night, Stéphane. Good night, dear. We used the same words every night. What do they really mean? That we love each other? Belle A man could have wished goodnight every night of your young life if you had lived. Hi. Hi, Sir. Sergeant Ruchet. - It's about the letter? - Yes. - I wrote all I know. - We'll see. You're Italian? Half. What does it mean, half? My mother is French. Alright, but for the other half you have an ID? Of course. - Would you like something? - No thanks. Where were they? In this room. Lovers always sit there. He was young? Yes. She looked above age or else I wouldn't serve them alcohol. We respect the law, my boss is honest. What did you give them? He wanted a beer. She whispered to him, they argued. They seemed to not get along well. How old was he? About thirty. Tall, dark hair, not very nice. He insisted to take her off right away. She finally followed him. They always end up saying yes. Do you recognize her? We see so many girls. You rent rooms? To travellers only. We follow the rules. I take you to Geneva. The mortuary open at 7am? As a nurse during the war, I've had my share of corpses. Come on. I thought you were familiar with corpses. Soldiers had to die but a pretty face like this. SQ? It's not her. She wasn't that young she seemed more mature. You're sure? Yes. Her hair was darker. Thanks. The bastard. Men like that, I would punch them. Wait until we find him. If we had to be convinced before charging a suspect... SQ? She's not the one. I didn't make them go through all the men's pictures. If it wasn't her, it wasn't him. SQ? You have no right to charge Blanchon. You want to wait until he commits suicide? He's stuck in a corner If I charge him now, he'll confess. You can't do that. The neighbour's testimony offers another lead. Let Mrs Pidoux come in. Neighbors see too many things. I was a judge for 25 years that's a lot of experience. Hello, Mrs Pidoux. Hi, kid. Mrs Pidoux, could you tell the judge what to told me earlier? How far is your house from Mr Blanchon's villa? About a 100m, Sir Judge. M Beckmann is the judge. Fine. You see clearly from 100m away at night? My eyes are flawless like the rest. At 60, I wheelbarrow 50 kg of laundry to the wash house. I don't see the connection. You said I'm seeing things. Answer my questions. Was your mother seeing things at my age? I told you there's no connection. But let's not loose our temper we've known each other for so long. What exactly did you see? The girl came home first. The man who was with her went to park his car behind the trees. What were you doing at your window at 11 pm? M Beckmann, we live in Switzerland. Women can't vote, but they can check the weather! Calm down, Mrs Piloux. He's getting on my nerves! A kid I've known since he was that small! Go ahead, Mrs Piloux. Absolutely, Sir Judge. When one is polite, I answer. So she came out after a while. She still had her raincoat on? No. She waited by the entrance and a figure appeared in the shadow who was watching her come out. She held something out to him and slowly closed the door. And then? Then I went to bed. You would've loved to see me keep watching you boorish kid! C'mon, Mrs Pidoux. M Beckmann has grown up he's an investigating magistrate. Tall like that! He was buying licorice in my store rarely paying for it. What about M Pidoux? He didn't see anything. Thank you, Mrs Pidoux. Your testimony will be useful. I'll summon you another time. Please, do. No hard feelings, Mrs Pidoux. I did it for your poor mother, Elie Beckmann! Thanks for her. You're welcome. I'll close the door myself. In spite of the licorice story that makes her words suspect you won't deny that her testimony exonerate Blanchon. Ms Shermann gave her key to the person who entered the house. Or something else. Has her key been found? No. Did you find anything? Yes and no. In murder cases, one never knows. Mr Blanchon's here? He's at the school. Goodbye, Mrs Blanchon. The judge will inform you. Mrs Blanchon Have you seen your garage's doors? You should erase it before Mr Blanchon comes home. Sit down. We'll work twice as hard to catch up. No test today. I though it's a good news for most of you. Adam. Where were we last time? The French revolution? It's rather vague Or vast, I would say. When exactly during the French revolution? Excuse me, Mr Blanchon. M Genet would like to see you. Remain calm, gentlemen. I come back soon. I'm terribly embarrassed and hope you'll help me to make my task less painful. I understood, Sir. I'm receiving many anxious phone calls. Indeed, anxious. This morning, the Swiss radio news talked about the case. I got 20 phone calls in less than 2 hours. The tone is different from yesterday. Most parents believe you're innocent but they also feel that the less children are involved the better. You certainly agree. Yes, Sir. Once the investigation ends and people calm down... Go inside, don't watch this. I'll wipe it out in a minute. People are horrible. The principal said I should stay home for a few days. I came to ask your wife a few questions. I didn't expect to see you here. The principal advised to avoid school for a few days. It's a wise decision. Come in. I was cleaning this. I see. Wipe it out quickly. The police officer came back Poor man. Can't they leave him alone? With all the boys she dated. Do they have to interrogate this one? He's innocent. They know what they're doing. People are cruel. I let you talk privately. You can stay, Mr Blanchon. Have a sit. Would you like some whisky? Since I'm only a witness... Good idea. It will be less formal. Mrs Blanchon, you knew Belle Shermann better. Let's talk about her. For our investigation, we need to understand her personality. Thanks. What first struck me was the whisky issue. With a girl drinking in bars, OK, but in this house... As you can see, we also drink sometimes but moderately. Moderately, like everybody. We asked the American police. Belle Shermann was arrested a few months ago in Virginia for drunk driving at 2am. Her mother's car? She stole it once, despite Lauren's objection. Not this one the car of the married man who was with her. Lauren knew about it? Of course. The case was later dropped. The man had connections. I'm speechless. I introduced her to my friends, those who had daughters. She was barely using make-up. I even told her to be more flirtatious. Flirtatiousness has evolved a lot. Girls are often a mystery. I'm glad to have only boys. I need a list of the families you introduced Ms Shermann to. I'll write it down immediately, about ten names. Do I include families with no adult male? It's not necessary. Are you alright, Mr Blanchon? Not really. I might be wrong, but... I bet you haven't dated many girls, Mr Blanchon. I didn't date at all. None of the schools I attended were mixed. I went to school all my life. When I left it as a student, I entered as a teacher. I loved your den. May I see it again while your wife is writing down her list? Of course. You're the one who brought this armchair, aren't you? How do you know? It's more like you than the ones in the living room. It's all I kept from my father's inheritance. When did he pass away? Almost 20 years ago. What was the cause? He decided to leave. He was from an excellent family. He married a young lady from an even better family. That's what my mother's family believed. My father's conduct contrasted from what was expected from him. Especially regarding this. And women. He was disappointed by his marriage. The family circle was suffocating him. So he decided to leave. He was a charming man. Do you envy him? I inherited neither his charm nor this. Rather a kind of fear. You underestimate yourself, at least regarding the charm. All the boys with whom she had an intimate relationship confirmed that she told them they're too young for her, that she was in love with an older man. We recently found another handbag with the house key in it. Sadly for you, it proves she didn't give it to someone as your neighbour's testimony suggested. We found inside a letter to a friend where she says she was in love with you. Dear Luce, you might think it's fun to be in Europe. Life drags on here as everywhere. The same boys enjoying the same games that were boring us last year in Virginia. He still doesn't look at me as if I wasn't here. If only he knew I love him. He's almost 40. You might think I'm crazy. If he knew I dream about him every night. While he's sleeping stupidly beside his wife. When we go out, I always sit behind him. I'm an inexperienced girl, supposedly. I like to take the back sit. With a bit of luck, I can meet his eyes in the mirror. I wonder if that day he did it on purpose. The next night, I left my door open just as I was going to bed. Modern girls behave badly. His wife was upstairs He couldn't miss me on his way up. I heard his foot steps and then nothing. He didn't stop to wish me goodnight. The evening, his wife went out. We're alone in the house. But I know nothing will never happen with him. Tonight, I go out with somebody else. A boy I haven't told you about. He's my new lover but I don't like him. Why he never looks at me? What was he thinking when he saw me hang the laundry. That I'm crazy? His wife needed my help. Funny she thought I'm that type of girl. I pretended as usual to not mind. He came to the garden smoking his pipe. I started to enjoy it. If you've seen how he felt embarrassed. I could kiss him. But it's another man, younger and more handsome who I didn't like that I kissed again this night. - Did this letter convinced you? - No. I'm sure he never looked at this girl. Blanchon is an honest man too honest Whereas the boys behind the door looked at her with envy. This girl slept with the whole Geneva. But interrogate the whole city, you won't get anywhere. We blame Blanchon, but Philippe Berthet is as much suspicious. He brought Belle home that night. The film ended at 10:45 pm. He testified he returned right after to Geneva but at 11:50 pm a witness saw them kissing outside his car. The doctor certified that Belle died about two hours before Mrs Blanchon's return. Who said this boy didn't come back in Belle's room? Nobody. Nobody in this murder case seems to know anything. Why didn't he say he hanged around with Belle? To hide that she's his mistress. Let Philippe Bertet come in. Philippe Berthet. Summoning at 4 am, 7am the first one get in. They go too far! It's nervous, that's all. Put your clothes on. It's so cold in my office. We think summer is here, but... How long have we known each other? Since my mumps. I was 9. You were a nice little girl well-behaved. Your symptoms aren't surprising given the life you have now. I give you some tranquillizers. Tell me about your life with Stéphane. Were you happy before all this? Of course. He's a good husband? Certainly. One could be tempted, with a well-behaved wife. Tell me the profound harmony between a man and a woman in spite of your soft temper... You know what I mean. Is your union strong? I don't care about these things. Neither does he. It's a mistake, Christine. These things end up being a real concern. Then, bad things happen. Belle didn't know what she wants. Like most girls. Leave Belle alone. You teased her enough when she was alive. She wasn't very friendly. You always say that when a girl rejects you. She was schizophrenic. That's right, we're crazy to refuse sleeping with you. How else to explain she preferred old men? Who said she preferred them? Hi everybody. You haven't been arrested? I thought it'd last 5 min but I was suspect #1. You know what this bitch did? - Philippe! - Bitch, absolutely! I told the police, I can tell you. We slept together that night 10 min later, she met another man. It didn't end well. Who told you that? The judge. He suspected I came back and killed her. I thought I can't escape being charged. How you proved it's not you? A lady saw us kissing at 11.50 pm when Belle went with me to the car. At 12:00 am sharp, I burst a tire in Geneva. The garage mechanic could tell the exact time. HOW? Because of a carbuncle, he takes sulfonamide every 3 hours thus saving my life. Geneva isn't far, you could've come back. No, daddy's Limit was waiting for me in his pyjamas. He scolded me for missing his birthday dinner. A double scotch, Léon. We're nice, we would have missed you. Not as much as me. What would you like? A cognac. She really was a bitch. She never said she loved me. She wasn't attracted to young men. She also steeped with Eric. If I ever see him... Where is he? Back home, after a telegram from his parents. Miraculous, no? A police agent will interrogate him in Stockholm. A weird guy. We're all weird. I must leave. This whole story made my dad nervous. He wants me in bed by midnight. I'm innocent, so I comply. Goodbye, baby. Bye everybody- He touched Belle held her in his arms. It's late. I was too nervous to sleep. I walked. You drank! A little bit, sorry. Stéphane, there's a problem. What problem? The temple. And? Tomorrow is Sunday. We never missed the worship. I called the pastor for advise. What did he say? He doesn't see why you shouldn't come, unless... Unless I'm guilty, I suppose. They were singing love, but their eyes showed hate. I was guilty. I wasn't one of them. For 10 year, they tolerated me but it wasn't my church it wasn't my village. No family here knew my family. None of my dead was buried in their cemetery. I was the stranger who's different. It could only be me. We'll comment today Psalm 24 Verse 18 and 19. The path of the just is as the shining light that shines more and more unto the perfect day. The way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they stumble. There's a reason I chose this psalm. A terrible even has darkened the happy mood of our community. Evil reached us. He might be among us. You who came today in Lord's house to hide among the righteous... The righteous. I sat every Sunday beside Christine. From fear of living, I embraced their tidy world only to be rejected now. I hate their world. I refuse to be one of them. It's enough to look at their face to doubt. He'll hit him in the most unexpected way when the time comes. His gesture isn't due to a moment of distraction. One day the murderer will repeat it. Murder calls for murder. He who has sinned will sin again. Amen. I'm glad our Lord isn't as nasty as this priest. Let's sing Canticle 18: "Beware of the Evil". BEWARE, BEWARE OF THE EVIL HIS PATH IS ALWAYS SINNING Let's go. We can't! They can sing, I want to leave. Hello. You're French, the French are seducers. The girl was seducing too. - All the girls do it. - All. We had one from Freiburg at home. Brought by the priest to improve her French and help with the housework. She improved in all fields Now she's pregnant. I heard your daughter is pregnant too. It's an Italian who works at the garage. My wife warned him, he agreed to marry her. Jeanne! Thanks. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye, Jeanne. - Hands off, M Pidoux! Insolent old man! Lauren. My husband. More luggages? No. Let's go to our house, you need a rest. No. I need a drink. - A Scotch. - A tea. Where is she? In Geneva for the procedures. I must see her to make arrangements. You take her back to Virginia? No way I leave my daughter here! You must wait until tomorrow to see the judge. Come have a rest at home. Another. Thanks for being understanding. We'll be there at 9 pm sharp. The judge will see her tonight. What do we do for tonight? We can't decently put her in belle's room. She can sleep with you. Won't you feel uncomfortable? No. Men are pigs. You drink too much, Lauren. Why do you care? I told you, only one thing interests them then they blame you for being easy going. Calm down. What they call love is a need to ruin one's reputation. Nothing else. You think I say this because I'm drunk. No, Lauren. Pigs. What is it? Cars. People come to see the villa out of curiosity. It's time to meet the judge. What does he want. Formalities. I won't let him criticize her! I know she was drinking. I drink too. At 18, she was sleeping with everybody. Now she's dead. If her father didn't leave us if we had both taken care of her she'd become another girl. I dislike your husband. He's quiet, sly. No. He's just very unhappy. You know what Elisabeth, Belle' best friend, told me? Belle wrote her many times that she loves him. It's impossible! A little girl talks nonsense. Belle wasn't any more a little girl. She loved once a married man in Virginia. The man almost left his wife for her. Shut up. You almost finished? I confess I smoked slowly to avoid the chore but I said I'd help you. Hypocrite, we're done. On Sundays, everybody helps! I'm sorry. I'm very clumsy. She'll scold us, but I'll say it's my fault. I'm used to it. It's nothing. Aunty Anna's decanter! - It's certainly you. Naturally. I even cut myself. You're either clumsy or did it on purpose. You always disliked Aunt Anna. Come Belle, let's finish tidying up. Your statement. You withdraw the balance? Yes. If I were you, Blanchon I wouldn't take out all my money. Doing so means you plan to leave the city. If you plan to leave, it means you're guilty. Truth can be that stupid. - You followed me here? - No. Great intuitions are found in detective novels only. It's also my bank, that's all. Give me 500 francs in small bills. It's a good stroke of luck I wanted to see you again. You're going to charge me? The police is convinced you're an honest man. But I'm not stupid your gesture might be due to panic. You need a breath of fresh air. We made your life difficult these days. I believe you're the key to our puzzle. To see clearly, we need to know you better. As a witness, we can't by law let a psychiatric examine you. Will you agree to let my friend Prof. Lewis an eminent doctor of the young movement be present at our next meeting? It's nobody's business who I am! Given the context, it's my business too. There's a point I wish to clarify. Inspector Dalcroze told me your father committed suicide. He shot himself in the mouth with a gun. - It's his business. - Sure. What pushed him to do it? He's had enough about life. Isn't it a good enough reason? No. Did he made bad business decisions? Was he facing unexpected difficulties? My family said he wasted his and my mother's wealth having a wild time. You liked him very much, didn't you? It's none of your business! It is, actually. I missed my breakfast because of you. I went over the whole file. Did you have many friends at school? Some comrades. And real friends? Very few. In fact, none. None if one takes the word literally. You were a loner. Not really. I played soccer, basketball. I even acted in plays. See if this helps, I was the second murderer in Macbeth. You weren't after your comrades' company. They weren't after mine. Because of your father's reputation? I don't know. I didn't say this. Don't you think that your shyness and susceptibility made you withdrew into yourself dangerously? Did you marry late, Mr Blanchon? At 30. It's considered late these days. You had many... affairs? You didn't answered Prof. Lewis' question. Do I have to? You decide. It's not a formal questioning. We all agreed to have a friendly conversation. By the meaning of the word you used I didn't have affairs. Flirtations? Certainly not. You were avoiding women's company, didn't you? I wasn't after it. Good. Does this imply that, up to your marriage you didn't have sexual relationships? It's not true I had some. Since your marriage did you have relationships with women other than your wife? No. Now I'll ask you a very specific question, Mr Blanchon. Don't be offended, I'm a scientist. It was dark. The unveiling by this pretentious idiot lasted the whole day. What if I had asked him how many women he killed? Or if his father wasn't fed up with his mother? At least, they didn't arrest me tonight. I was irresistibly thinking about my father the reason he avoided coming home. I felt like going out with him that night. Let's go out together. Don't I deserve it, Dad? Why go see Mom after a session like this? Sorry. It's good to be outside, Dad. With the others those who live. It's good, but one gets thirsty. Come, it's my treat. Is this tasty? If we're selling it it means some like it. Double. It'll go down faster. Have you known the Charleston? The real one, not what these idiots are dancing. I never danced. But my dad always whistled this tune. He was always out during the 1930 winter. A great era! People knew how to get drunk. Now they just drink. What can I offer you? Some people drink because they're thirsty. Are you thirsty? No. Why I'm never thirsty? People don't drink because they're thirsty. It's something else. It's... Anyway- Paris. The 1930s. Montparnasse. I'm French. Me too. I knew that. Congratulations. Paris 1930. I was so young. You were young too? - No. - It's a pity. You're allowed then to get old. But it takes time. - What? - To be old. It never ends. My father was young. He managed to stay that way. Not easy. He found a way. I like here, it's ugly. The atmosphere is crap. The subdued lighting the piano make you romantic. We drink badly. Always drink in ugly places. Be rigorous. Two Scotches! How are you, Ms Graf? Did you manage to type everything? It's you? Not really, but almost. Have a sit. Why not but I'm with a friend. He can wait. Just two minutes. Oh no. He certainly can wait. Look a friend. Son, she's old enough for you. But... she's ugly- I know, Dad. You're having a hot dog? I just came from work. Me too. A hot dog! What would you drink? A coffee. Beware of alcohol Especially if you had a lot. After all they did to you. I hope you don't hold a grudge against my boss. Not at all. He's doing his job. I thought you go straight home after your work. Why? I don't know. To reassure your wife. My wife reassures herself very well. I'm off today. I wouldn't have imagined. That I'm the type one finds in bars after sunset? Yes. Well, you'll meet me now. Blanchon isn't abnormal. Prof. Lewis will confirm it as well Dr. Clair who's treated him for 10 years. But he never cheated on his wife! It happens. He never had sexual relationships before marriage. At 30! Is he physically deficient? No. I'm positive. Prof. Lewis concluded that the fear of his father the old "mothers' malediction": "you'll be like your father!" Created in him a psychological inhibition. It's a frequent phenomenon. The number of men looking at women as a maternal security substitute is significant. Blanchon is manly his doctor can attest it. Nobody lives eternally on maternal security. One day, it falls apart. You've been Christine's doctor since childhood. She's not really a "flammable" woman. We're all men here. Their relationship is certainly quite discreet. He then finds himself with a 20 years old girl at home. A girl that loves him. She wrote it. If so, why did he kill her? That where I can argue that his honesty is another presumption supporting his guiltiness. You don't know puritans. The puritan acts to get free from his own disgust killing himself or his partner. This time, it was her. - What's so funny? - Nothing. Don't ask, life is too short. I look ridiculous? Not at all. I'm awkward? No. You handle it right. I had another opinion about you. To tell you the truth, me too. Well. Well what? Nothing. You can't understand. I must leave now. No. You're full of beans tonight! You promised to have a drink with me. I haven't. You did. Alright, I did. I take you to Little Cottage. It's a little bar inn. It's quite far! Not really. A half an hour drive scares you? No, but I must let my mom know. You'll call her from there. You teachers, when you go out! Come Dad, we switch dairy shop. We go to Little Cottage with this lady. Ms Graf, this is my father. Really? Really. Are you coming, dad? If you want, son... She's ugly- I know. Go in, Dad. Behave! There we go! I had a woman sitting in my car. It can't be easier than this. Christine must have started to worry. She'll soon ask Beckmann how long the questioning lasted. It's cold tonight. My name is Nina. It's pretty. You're Stéphane. I typed it so many times. I like that it can't be shortened. How your wife calls you? She doesn't call me. Your car caught a cold. What if it doesn't start when we're there? It's getting late. We'll be doomed to drink all night long. You so strong. It's not obvious at first sight. What it's got to do with him? Not many girls would go out with you these days. Does it scare you? I like that. Give me a coin, I'll play "Nina". I'm crazy about this tune because its title is my name. She's ugly I know, Dad. Did you ever dated Beckmann? What do think, that I'm virgin? I like you. You know why? You seem ordinary at first glance but you're a mystery. Do you know yourself who you are? No. Funny how you fooled them all. When I think that with the hands holding me know you might have... I was joking! Let's dance. Forget about all this. I don't care about the truth. Blanchon isn't a murderer. In our job, the truth means a coherent file but I have another opinion about truth and justice! It's a weakness in my job, but it's the way it is. Excuse-me. I need some fresh air it's stifling in here. He's honourable like Blanchon so we're making no progress. Both in one case, it's too much. The police and the accused must be equal chisellers. We get along and succeed. You promote paradoxes. Hardly. One does the act the other knows he could have done it. But he's honourable, he didn't do it. That's why he's hesitating. Strictly between us the girl was quite pretty. I just wouldn't have strangulated her after. Let's go. You're so impatient. We feel good here. Let's have another dance. I'll play Nina, give me a coin. No. You're selfish. Oh, men. What about your friend? Dad is sleeping. Christine certainly called. They were looking for me. The police car could come at any time now. Nobody will doubt I'm the one who killed Belle. Go pay nicely the bill, my dear. Ask to call a cab for your friend when he wakes up. You deserve to be happy now. It's your turn. Is what you said to Beckmann true? That never before, you...? Here we are. That was it. The time I didn't dare facing had arrived. That was so easy. She was going to ask this man for a room. He would lead us open a door. There will be a bed. That's all it is. There isn't any alternative. This caricature. Look at her! What? Come. Let's go. They're lovers like us. (in Italian) You won't have to be this one. Excuse-me. 6.90 francs. - Thank you. - Bartender? Yes, Sir? Another drink. Where's my buddy? He has fun. The Grangin farm. Jussy speaking. Where? Near Corsinge? The Grangin farm? Yes, I know. An assault at Grangin's in Corsinge. Take the Jeep. Who's there with your men? Test them before. Make him talk there. Tell him to Inform Dalcroze right away. Its too similar to the American girl's case. Quiet! It's nothing. You're lucky you have a loud voice. Your dog too. Everything's alright. Good. Let your dog go out. Give him a sugar. So once you start you can't stop. If one resists, you press. It's a bad habit you have. I pity you. With such a beautiful wife like yours. The American girl, you strangulated her before or after? Before. Can I make a call? Here Policeman Chris teller. Can I talk to inspector Dalcroze? He's still there? I'll call him. If I were you Beckmann, in all honesty I'd give up charging this man. Maybe you're right. It's about a man's ho nor, not about a case file. We'll investigate more follow new leads and then give them up. Inspector Dalcroze. Where are you? You're alone? Now yes. You can come. - A whisky. - Which one? It doesn't matter. (in Italian) She's still upstairs. (in Italian) Have you seen the scratches on his face? (in Italian) Go have a look. It's getting cold tonight. (in Italian) He killed her! You'll see, bastard! But I just called the police myself! (in Italian) Bastard! Swine! Son! English subs: undertaker@KG Edited by: OldMovieMan@KG
