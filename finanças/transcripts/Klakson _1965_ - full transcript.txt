I'll kill myself. I'd like to travel. You'll travel soon. You're boring. It'll be the same again. Work, eat, sleep, work, eat, sleep. I'll kill myself. That's the only way out. I won't be going back. I'm fed up with smoke and dust. I'll fish on Red lake. You need iron muscles for that, look at yourself. Fishermen run to smoke and dust. When are you going to kill yourself? I'll hang myself sooner than you think. It runs nicely. Like some old music. If only I could be a child once again. What would you do then? I'd probably want to grow old again. I'd smoke secretly in the bush above the house. I'd hide under the table and untie guests' shoelaces. I'd steal cherries from the neighbor and kiss his daughter. After school, I'd kick ball. My ears burned when I kissed her, and she got all red. She run up the stairs giggling. I never saw her again. My first love. Did she love you? I don't know. Was she beautiful? I didn't meet more beautiful. She was 12. - Oh? I was 7. Burning in the sunlight is the most beautiful thing in the world. New ones? They don't look bad. Good day. Good day. We got lost. Do you know direction to mountaineers' home "Eagle's nest"? You lost your breath. They told us in the bus that home is near the road. We've been wandering for an hour. We'll go there soon, it's lunch time. Sit. Catch your breath. You're here for vacation? We're loosing time. Are there many guests here? Almost none. Just one old widow. ??? And somebody comes along too. My name's Marko. Marko Lakic, doctor. Viktor Sandic, engineer. Where do you come from? From afar. Sisters? Perhaps. You're not very kind. Why would we be? We'll show you the way, carry the things. That's why I have to be kind? How long do you intend to watch me without blinking? It seems to me we already met. Probably. Not recently. Yes, long time ago. You were 12 years old. ??? It was beginning of spring. You were standing in the backyard near the stairs. Yes, yes. Now I remember. On one leg as a stork. Your dog was asleep. I jumped over the fence. And suddenly kissed you on the cheek. You got red in the face. And then burst into laughter. You had blond, curly hair. Curly? - Yes, just like women's curls. Curly. I was in love with you to death. Why didn't you say? Did you ever, at least little, loved me? I never knew. - Great. - Shut it, Marko. Please, why did you laugh that much when I kissed you? I laughed because it was funny. - Where did you go the day after? - I don't understand. After the kiss you run up the stairs and I never saw you until now. Neighbors said you moved to another city. There were no stairs we lived on the first floor. We never moved. Impossible! I remember every moment, perfectly. Me as well. You had blond curls like a girl back then. Now your hair is smooth and dark. How do you know that? Ten years ago your picture was in the papers for long time. Ah yes, you're an actress. - No. Ten years ago, papers wrote... how granddaughter and grandson viciously killed their grandparents. - I'm that granddaughter. - What? Yes, I'm that granddaughter. I was convicted to 12 years in prison for helping in murder. My brother...??? I covered grandpa's mouth with pillow and brother with an axe... Stop it. Yes. I behaved well in prison, so they released me 2 years earlier. Day before yesterday. I'll rest a little here before next kill. I'm hungry-You Jana? - We could go. I'm hungry too. You seriously didn't run? - No. - You didn't run up the stairs? - I didn't. If you want come with us, if you don't go to hell. Lets go Jana. - Hurry up. - Lets go. Admit! You ran up the stairs! I didn't! I'm so hungry. We should've waited. - Whatever! I can't recognize you. You became so snappy all of the sudden. Does she really look like your first love? Not the least. She was lovely and gentle. This one's got such a hard look and eyes. Why? She's really gentle. Engineer had sad eyes when you told him your boy had blond hair. I really wished you ran up the stairs in that moment. I did run up. 28 steps, I thought I was flying over them. I think she'd be capable to kill her grandfather. She could help you with killing yourself. What the hell? Just like that. I wanted to see how meeting with the first love looked like. I recognized him as soon as I saw him. He still has the same smile, the same dark hair. I loved him with some strange girly love that disappeared during years. Why didn't you tell him you were the one he loved? I remembered a film. In a castle, a man and a woman meet and can't remember if they know each other until the end. I thought why shouldn't I... live at least for a moment life of a movie character. You'll tell him who you are over the lunch? No. You mustn't either. Night will fall soon. We'll get lost, better to hurry up. They must've got lost. They could wander for days in the woods. Your consciousness is bothering you. Come on. Shall we? Are they good looking? If they are not, don't bother. Where's the manager? I don't know. Better to go back, we could get lost too. Listen, we started something with them. I introduced myself as a doctor... - And I as an engineer. That's great. That always works. I know but in the case... Don't worry. It's better to go back. Really, Victor, guy has a point. How can we help when we don't know the way? We'll get lost too. I'm afraid. Damned forest looks like it's made of stone. There are must be bears. Aren't you afraid? Of course I'm afraid. If I only knew where to go... Lets shout. Maybe someone will hear us. Help us! Don't come near. I heard your shouts. Don't come near. I have a knife. Don't be afraid. I'm the keeper of forest. Take us from this jungle. I'll go nuts. You won't. I've been living here for 18 years and I haven't gone crazy yet. I'll take you. Where are you going? To the mountaineers' home for vacation. You're nature lovers? - Yes. Give me your luggage. - No need. No need. Thanks. Give me that. We can carry it by ourselves. Good evening. Good evening. Come on. I'm coming after you, slowly. Hurry up. You're tired and angry but I'm very pleased to meet you. I haven't spoken a word with anyone for months. You live alone in this forest? All alone. Sometimes someone gets lost like you now or lumberjacks come and that's it. Go to the mountaineers' home if you really want to talk. No, no. I don't have time. Get married, be a jealous husband and you won't be bored. I've been thinking about that for years anxiously. What for? Your wife's lover? About the one who's going to really love and understand me. Am I going to find any, who's going to accept to come to this jungle? At the end, do I have rights to take away all those pleasures in the city? Woman needs to be taken care of. She needs kindness. She needs fun. Lose in company of friends. What friends can I find her here? Bears, wolves, snakes? You'll never get married if you continue to think like that. I know. Sometimes I want to leave. If she doesn't accept, I'll put her in bag and bring her here. Do that. She'll be grateful. Many desire to be put in a bag and take into the wilderness. I told you we should've gone back. - Stop talking nonsense. - Don't you talk to me. Beasts could've skin us to the bones. Yes, yes, to the bones. What beasts? Stories about beasts, a couple of kids, love. That's all I could give to the woman who'd marry me. That's plenty. When snow falls, when one can't move from the cabin one curses the day he was born. Somebody knocks on the door you think 'Here, someone finally came' 'You'll talk' 'Hear news', 'Exchange thoughts'... but you look through the window and in front of the door a pack of wolves. What can I talk to woman in those winter days except what I already said? How to entertain her? To impersonate... bears, wolves, birds? You think that'd entertain her? You can impersonate animal voices? Of course. Show us, how wolf in love howls? You're serious? Seriously! We're listening. There. Beautiful. And how does the hungry wolf howl? Beautiful. Go as fast as you can to the city. Women will jump into your bag themselves. Perhaps. Perhaps. - Well, goodbye. - Do you want a drink? No. I swore I won't cross the doors of that place. Why? - Good night. - You live far. - 2 hours walking. - May we visit you? Pick us up some of these days. You'll be the first women who entered my cabin. I'll call you from here. I'll hoot as owl. It'll be a sign. Like this... Good bye. - Have a nice rest. - Good night. Good night. Sit down, girl. As your highness commands. You've been here for 4 days. You must be filled with great impressions. Please tell me how you like it. It's fitting. Write that down in the book of impressions. It'll be even more beautiful next year. Tennis court will be here... and there, a huge Olympic swimming pool... and everywhere around, lots of nice parasols. Yes, yes. Why lumberjack never wants to enter the home? I apologize, I've emergency business to attend to. I overheard your conversation. You shouldn't be worried about lumberjack's feelings. My name's Olga, widow. I've been coming to this place for 10 years. In a row. I've been listening to his stories about grand changes for 10 years. Nothing changed. Although... trees have grown. Didn't it get boring to come here for 10 years? Not the least. Since my husband died, I don't like any changes. As an old guest, you must know the reason for lumberjack's and manager's fall out. They fell out? I'm sure. I didn't notice. Although, my late husband used to tell me but, no, you wouldn't understand. Neither did I. Hurry up. Shall we? We're going. You're going for a walk? We're going for some fresh air. Do you know how to howl as a wolf in love? What? Do you know how to howl as a wolf in love? What are you thinking? Can you sound like a bear? As a bear! ...wild animals. Surgeon and bear. To wait for those two? You must've noticed we're in the way. You're bored with me. It beautiful for a walk. Shall we take a bath? Water is cold. Only in the beginning. I don't have swimming suit. I do. So... Then turn around. You shouldn't watch. Has anyone confessed you love... in cold water? No! Then I'll do it. Do it before I freeze. I love you. What? I didn't hear you well. I love you! What? I can hear only my teeth clanging. I...love...you...! Lost in thoughts? I remembered something. Kiss me. What? Kiss me like you used to at the stairs. I never kissed you. Don't be afraid, I won't laugh now. I never kissed you. I'm your Ema. Her name was Irena. Please don't torture me anymore. Is it because I said I don't remember? I was joking. You really weren't on those stairs. Kiss me. You'll remember everything. Please kiss me. Thank you. Now you remember it was me. She was completely different. Stop please, I'll tell you. Enough. Tell me about your job. Is it hard to be a doctor? I don't like talking about that. I ran away here from all that cutting and puss, suffering, blood, stench... and death. Horrible. It was horrible when I was left alone. Completely alone. I came back to the apartment after the funeral. It was getting dark. Only the furniture was cracking. I leaned my forehead against the window, it wasn't cold as in the novels. I stood like that until the morning. I didn't have courage to turn around. Furniture was cracking incessantly. And I didn't notice it until that night. The I started traveling. I traveled a lot. Always alone though, often in numerous company. I was drawn to painting so I became a painter. You told me you're byzantologist yesterday. I told that. What are you? Byzantologist, painter, murdered or? Or? Or something else? I've been yearning for all these years to find you. To kiss me again. To be together again. To everything be nice as it used to be. And now you tell me I'm not the one who you kissed. You're not. I am. I am. It's better I'm not. You're mine now. I can't lie. Bon jour. May I ask you something? Ask. Why manager doesn't like lumberjack? I guess he cheated on cards. Took his wife. Something like that. And perhaps he's his brother. I've been here for just 19 years. Believe me I've no idea. When are we going to marry? Here, right? I'll help you with surgeries. I always love the smell of hospitals. It wasn't you. It was me. No, it wasn't you. I want to find out what is the final purpose of our joys and miseries. Why we love, hate, be born and kill each other. Why we lie. Why we speak truth. Why we exist at all. What's the sense of all that. You're very serious. I thought you were superficial at first. You see... I'm supposed to be a man who succeeded in life. Many envy me. Some prophesied I'll be the most famous doctor. Perhaps I'll be. But that has nothing to do with happiness. I just want to be a happy man. Always, like now. You'll be a famous doctor, a happy man. I'm sure of it. I'll help you. From the beginning, I was fantasizing... I was to be a doctor. But I became geodet. I spent sleepless nights. I inquiry the causes. I often think about suicide. Shut up. Shut up. You'll make me cry. I never thought about those things. You're the first person I talked to about this. I'll tell you everything. Don't talk. So gentle, so dear. He told me everything about him. I saw he wanted compassion, he wanted to cry. And I cried a lot. I love him. We'll marry. I start studying medicine. It's never too late, right? I made a mistake coming here. I wouldn't see my worst defeat. Perhaps he was just joking? Joking? He really doesn't believe I'm the girl from the stairs. I can't be with her anymore. She always watches me so... so... I don't know anymore. Who knows who's she. She keeps saying different avocation. It weren't just us who changed their profession? You think Ana told you her real occupation? I don't care about what she's doing. I have to find a nice way to say to her... I'm not a doctor. Why nice? Otherwise, I'll lose her. Welcome. Welcome. - Here you are. - Oh, thank you very much. Here you are. I'm glad to welcome you. It'll be much nicer next year. You'll see. We'll cut forests, it'll be magnificent, huge swimming pool and all around large colorful parasols. And the tennis court, you'll see. Welcome. You'll see, it'll be much nicer. Take luggage to the room, I'll take a walk. Go for it and breath in deeply this wonderful air. I won't go to the dinner. You have to. I can't anymore. I can't lie she's not her anymore. Oh, did I lie to mine... I made up sad stories about my life, I was being smart, telling all sorts of things about doctor stuff. She cried as rain. I almost believed my own lies. Are you sure you're not lying now? I won't. You must. What am I to do with two women? Don't ruin my bliss. We craved for it so much. You have to check in at your job, day after tomorrow. We're leaving in the morning, I'm fed up with everything. I'm not leaving. I'm staying here. We'll marry. She's wonderful. I call her 'little cloud' and she calls me 'little butterfly'. 'Little butterfly'. Little butterfly... You fool. You promised you'll hang yourself. What are you waiting for? Here you are. Thank you. - I'd like something to eat. - Right away. - Boy? - Right away. We have everything. Good evening. Yes? What would you like? Grilled lamb, smoked meat, meatballs in sauce, oysters on ice, sour cream, fresh fish... I'd like something light. Pancakes with nuts, then? - Alright. As long it's fresh. - In a minute. Did you sleep well? - A bit. - Me too. A bit of this now? Don't pay attention to manager's words. I've been coming here for 10 years and I've listened to stories about great changes. - About great plans. - I couldn't care less about his plans. Alright then. - My late husband once said... - Your husband sounds like a wise man. Oh, yes. Very. You've been all these years for manager to propose to you? Me? Who told you that? Don't lose time. You propose to him. You think... You think he'd accept? I'm sure. What's all this then? What's up? Why are you all silent? I'm consuming my food. I have a headache. Great! My doctor will show his skills now. Well, I apologize. I've nothing on me. Too bad. It'll pass anyway. Stop staring at that brat whole night. You're sitting with us. And it looks as if you're in her arms. Unfortunately, I'm not. - Entertain her. - Shut up. You see. How come you're here? What? Why are you all so silent? I always bring cards with me. Do you want to play a game? Great! Noble game. I'm cutting. Here you are. 8, 2, queen, 10. - Come on. - Who's on? - Is there something? - Well... Easy, leave something for me. He had a gun. You just imagined that. Nice music, isn't it? I saw him just as I see you know. Listen...if he comes... Don't get excited. Can nurses dissect corpses sometimes? They can. They can? But only on Sundays and holidays, from 3 to 5. I don't want to play anymore. You must ruin everything. Stay a little longer. I'm tired. Good night. That's all because of you Victor. You're very unkind towards her. And he just stars at her like mad. And now at me. Looking at his suit, lumberjack. I didn't see him until now. He still stares at me. I'll slap him if he continues. I'm off to watch stars. What's up with you? You're all leaving. You got out for fresh air too? I like to watch stars, to take walks. It's pretty cold. I apologize, perhaps I'm bored you? I've been expecting to come to me the whole evening. I wanted to. But my company... Lets walk. You can call me Sonja. My name's Victor. I found out that from the worker. All the time we were watching each other, I was thinking we must know each other from somewhere. As we are very, very old friends. Now I know. You're incredibly alike to my first love. I reminded you of your first love? You were standing at huge, undulating stairs. Yes? - I jumped over the fence... - Yes? And kissed you on the cheek. I was 7 and you were 12, back then. - Now I'm 32 years old and you are 20. - 19! I saw there was a nice orchard up there. Lets go. Stop it. Please. Leave me alone. Where were you until now? I'm sorry, it wasn't my intention to wake you. I thought you were with Eva, she got all bloated from crying. We comforted her all night. To hell with Eva. Do you know the girl who used to watch us all the time? You were with her? Do you know who she is? Lucretia Borghia. She ran up the stairs when I was 7. Really? Forget her. You're going home in the morning. You're holiday is over. Job is waiting. I'm staying here. You said you were fed up with it. I'll fish. I made the decision. Her name's Sonja. Let me sleep. Jana and me decided. We'll marry here. Did you tell her that you're not a doctor? I haven't. There wasn't a chance. I have to be delicate. You don't believe Sonja's the girl from the stairs? The one from the stairs is called Ema. Good night! You should kill yourself already. What's up with you? Leave me alone! I'm happy for the first time in my life. Yea right! - We'll make hut on the shore. - Right? We'll fish. Hunt for crocodiles. Listen, if I hit you over head with this... You're leaving in the morning. I'm going to the lake with Sonja to pick a place for the hut. Remember, Sonja's the most beautiful girl I've ever met. Open up. Wake up. It's past 8. It's me, Victor. Sleep well, I'll be back in an hour. Sleep, sleep. Bon jour. I've got a message for you. - From who? - The little one you last night... - She sends her regards. - Regards? Yes, yes. She left earlier today. Where? She didn't say anything. She just sent her regards. Paid her bills, picked her luggage and left. Toward the Red Lake? No, down to the road. You're joking. She must've told something more. 'Please send regards to the gentleman'. That's all. She turned and left whistling. Is chess a hard game? You won't play chess with a nice weather like this? We'll play, why not? Even better, Marko will tells us Latin names for all diseases. How do you say sneeze in Latin? I've asked you so many times not to talk about it. I fed up with medicine. I'm on holiday now. You don't love me at all. I love you. I love you. I adore you. I apologize for these public displays of affection. I love you. But understand, I' fed up with hospitals. And...medicine. I'm really fed up. Alright, alright. I won't anymore. You won't do anything for me. Why are they not bringing coffee? I'll bring it myself. I'm back in a second. I don't know why is it so hard for him to talk about his job. He knows I love to hear about it. Perhaps he's not doctor at all. What? What did you say? I say, maybe he's not doctor. Why would he be? He said, the worker said, you're really malicious. He is a doctor. He must be. I could bet he isn't. What's up with you? Isn't it clear that... he's avoiding talking about medicine cause he knows nothing about it? But who cares. You'll marry him, you love him, you'll have children... He's a doctor. I can't imagine him otherwise. I want to play chess. Alright. I want to bet you on whatever you want that he's a doctor. He isn't. Alright. I'll prove you he is. How are you going to prove that he's a doctor? You'll see. Hello Victor. Where's... When are you going to the lake? - Later. She's still asleep. - Do you want a coffee with us? I don't. Bye. Nice day. Sky is blue, as blue sky. I feel sick. Stomach... What is it, child? Coffee is poisoned. Help me. What is it? Coffee isn't poisoned. Call a doctor! Doctor! You're a doctor. Help her yourself. What doctor? Who told you that? What? You're not a doctor? That's it. No, I'm not. What? But you... You're not poisoned? You're alright? You're not a doctor? You lied to me? I'll explain... Everything, I'll explain everything. You know, I couldn't... - tell you, you see... - You lied? No, listen I... I wanted to save it for later... Why did you lie? You lied for coffee too, you know. I'd help you with everything. But see Jana, it's got to do with... I was afraid, I wanted to... somehow later... position you know... Thank God, everything's fine. Return it. Our bus is coming! You know, it's... Come on, hurry up! I'm sorry Ema, holiday's over. We're going to be late. I'm sorry. Job is waiting. Holiday's over. I'm sorry, we're in a hurry, klakson's calling us. Autobus waits for 3 minutes only. What a nice day. Have a nice time. Good bye. Why are you leaving? It was really nice. Have a nice time.
