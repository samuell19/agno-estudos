Close the windows and drive. I have been saying this to many people. Why sir? Any problem? Are you new to Ranagiri? - Yes sir. Okay. Okay. Close the windows and drive without stopping even if you hear any sound. Close the windows and go. Go. What happened? Sir, car not starting. Go and check. Will get down and check. Anwar! Anwar! 'Roshan!' 'Roshan!' 'Roshan!' Sir! Look there! Something fell... What fell down? - I felt something fell... Where did you go? I saw a hotel on the way. Since the car got repaired I thought we could get some help. We will get some help if we go there. Alright. Lock the car. - Okay sir. Hello sir. Seen you somewhere. Very familiar face. Sir, he is home minister Rajiv Ravi's son, Roshan Ravi. Welcome to Ranagiri. We have 6 rooms. Are you a bachelor or married? - Look, I have not come here to stay. There is some problem with the car. Is there a mechanic here? Mechanic will not be available here at this time. I will surely help you tomorrow morning. You do not realize my urgency. I have to go to Bangalore. I understand your urgency but I think you do not know about Ranagiri. No one moves around after it is dark. Brother! Tea. Sir please. - Yes. You are visiting Ranagiri for the 1st time. It is not safe to travel at night. Yes sir. Even I would suggest the same. Okay. You guys have convinced me. But one thing... Do not address me brother. Call me Roshan. Come. I will show you the room. Please... Anwar! - Sir. Car should be ready in the morning. We should leave for our place. Alright sir. Why are you carrying the luggage? Don't you have boys to help you? Whoever joins here leave the job within a month. I am fed up of searching. Why? What is the problem here? Curse. Since British period there was a fear that sorcery is practiced here. That fear still persists. Is that why guards at the check post told me to raise the window glass? - Yes sir. I am also trying to sell my property here. But no buyers. Please this way. Don't we get mobile network here? Network is not very strong. Sir, one personal request. It is not safe to come out of the room at night. Call the landline number if you need anything. Sir, take the key. Yes. Good night, sir. - Good night. 'How do you hit that down there?' 'That is picked up. Beautifully batted!' 'Roshan!' Sir, Roshan. My son is not dead. Still there is time. Rahim! - Sir. Send the best officer from your department to Ranagiri. Yes sir. - I should know what happened to my son. Keep it off the record. You still have 48 hours from now. - Definitely sir. This information should not be leaked to media for any reason. Alright sir. Yes sir. - Okay. Okay. This way, sir. Do not send... What happened? What sort of a man he is? Never attends to calls. He calls the next day after a missed call. Wonder where he is now! Who is he? He is the Sherlock Holmes of our department. He is a crazy fellow. He imagines things and solves crimes through his imagination. His name is Shivaji Surathkal. Sir. - Shivaji. How many times should I call you? You are responding now. There is an important case. Where are you? A Psycho has been dodging our department since 3-4 years. Got a clue about him. I am on that sir. Shivaji drop that psycho case. Go immediately to a place called Ranagiri near Madikeri. Madikeri! 'Ji!' Shivaji! 'Ji!' Shivaji! - 'Ji!' 'Ji!' Shivaji, can you hear me? Yes sir. Sir, I do not want to handle this case. Come on Shivaji? Why are you still brooding over the past? I know that you have not gone to Madikeri since 5 years. I am not asking you to go now for a personal case. It is an official case. Sir, but I am really... - No excuses. I am sending all the information that you require though Whatsapp. Go to Madikeri immediately. Fine sir. Govindu! - Sir. Take U turn. We should go to Madikeri. Madikeri?! - Yes. Where are you going? Madikeri? One more new case? 'Yes. Case No.101.' 'It is actually a very interesting and bizarre case in my experience.' 'The dead person's name is Roshan,' 'son of home minister Rajiv Ravi.' 'The place where he died is Ranagiri, near Madikeri.' 'I have exactly 48 hours to crack this case.' 'And my time starts now.' He died of fear. No blood stains. Heart attack? May be. Only postmortem can confirm. Rigor mortis set in. So he must have died minimum 8 hours back. Two finger rings in his right hand. One new and another old. New one is in his ring finger. He must have got engaged recently. Or is it the girl's gift? Govindu! - Sir. Take out your wallet. Govinda is a right hander. So he keeps his wallet in the right side of his pant. He has kept it left side. So he must be left hander. Watch is on the left hand. There is a scratch in the watch! Victim's height - Almost 6 ft. Where is the driver who was with him? Sir, driver is missing. - What do you mean? He is missing since yesterday night. I see. Arrange for a search party. - Yes sir. Fax his photo to local police station and tell them to search for him. Okay sir. - Shift this body to mortuary. Should get the post mortem report fast. Yes sir. - Right. You look smart. Thank you sir. - What is your height? 5'11" - Oh! Almost 6'. Can you swim? No sir. Played in well water. That's all. I thought you will drown. But you survived. Sir! How will a 6' tall person drown in 5' water? No chance. Something is wrong. Something is wrong here. Something is wrong about this place. Something wrong... Something... Roshan's mobile. Who shifted the body? - Me. Who are you? - This resort owner. Order a coffee. So... You are Pritam Shetty. - Yes sir. Your wife's name is Smitha Shetty. You both got married on 26th Jan 2013. You were working as pilot in Commercial Airline. But now you have resigned the job and managing this resort. Am I right? Yes sir. You are right. But how do you know this? Can make out from your bright face. No dark circles. No wrinkles. So you do not work in the open. You work happily and comfortably in AC. But not IT job. No fat. You are physically fit. You are 6' tall. Hairstyle is perfect. Side locks trimmed properly. Classy body language... Classy... Even the perfume. So you were in a job which gave importance to physical appearance. Which job?! By seeing the photos hung at the back, I can make out you have seen nook and corner of this world. Your favorite collections explain that you love flying. The gift bag given by Air Asia to Pilots is lying there. So you are a commercial Pilot. But what made you leave the job? Why? The photo there shows you without specs. But now you use specs. Still no specs mark on your nose. So you must have got eye power recently. You know the rule... One can work as pilot only if he has perfect vision. So you lost your pilot job. Where else will you work then? Another photo there shows your entire family belongs to this place. So you have come here to live happily with family and managing this resort. Am I right again? You are absolutely right sir. Yes. Shivaji Surathkal is always right. But how did you know our marriage date? Very simple. Facebook profile? But I am not active on Facebook. You may not be active. But your wife is very active. But no updates since 4-5 months. Any problem? No... No problem. Right. Let me come to the point. When Roshan fell into the swimming pool, his watch stopped. According to me, time of death is 1.30 at night. But you informed local SI Rudresh at 5.30 in the morning. Why so much delay? There was phone network problem. So could not call the station. I had to go and call SI Rudresh. So it got little delayed. - Little! Govindu. - Yes sir. Give this for laundry. - Okay sir. Thank you for the room. Welcome sir. How many days will you be here? My wish. Till the case is solved. Okay sir. - Contact that tall inspector. Rudresh. - Yes. Tell him that my tablets are over and ask him to get. Will send Whatsapp message. - Very important. Right sir. How many rooms are there in your resort? Total 6 rooms. Roshan's room number? - 1001 Pritam, what is your opinion about home minister's son Roshan? In what way? About his character. You have spoken to him. What do you think about him? Being minister's son... So... Arrogant, haughty, high handedness. So you did not like him. Sir, I did not say like that. You didn't say. But you think so... No sir. He was good... You may say so but your eyes say he was bad. Was he bad? Sir... - Right. Let us stop this topic. Show me Roshan's room. - Sir, this way. Oh! That way. Jaanu! Jaanu! Brought your favorite coffee. Come here. Jaanu! Where are you? Jaanu! Where did Gulma go? 'Mahesh was kidnapping girls' - Why have you played TV so loudly? 'from Mysore, Bangalore, Hubli, Mangalore,' 'Bombay throughout the country...' Jaanu! Jaanu! 'Ji!' 'Four years back, on May 15th 2015,' 'both Janani and Gulma went missing from house.' 'Janani's phone was not reachable.' 'Where did Janani go?' Note this. Only one pair of clothes is packed. So it is a one day trip. I think Roshan was a neat and organized person. How do you say? Apart from clothes, he has packed other items in the individual packets correctly. Trimmer, cosmetics, shampoo, belt... Look at this beauty. Beretta M9 semi automatic. He is minister's son. Self defence? There was something in this cover. But not there now. What would it have been? Check Roshan's recent Facebook post. I will check the Instagram. Pretty girlfriend! Dr Anjali. Oh! Psychiatrist. We have a problem. Come. Govindu! - Sir. Close and seal all the exits of the resort. Yes sir - No one should go out. Yes sir. But why sir? It is not a natural death. Somebody has murdered him. How do you say it is murder? So soon? From the Instagram photos, I could see that Roshan has won prize in swimming in high school. He is an expert swimmer. How will he drown in water and die? Point sir. But it can be suicide? Think that you are Roshan. - Yes sir. If you have a loaded revolver in hand, won't you shoot yourself and die rather than search for water and drown in it? Excellent sir. So this is not accident or suicide. It is a cold blooded murder. And there should be a murderer here. Come. Let us search. Hello! - Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Did Janani come there today? No. She has not come. 'It is 12.30 in the afternoon.' 'I have been calling everyone since one hour.' 'Nobody had information about Janani.' 'Called Govindu and told him to come to my house.' You may attend call later. There has been a murder here. Sorry sir. - Time of death is 1.30 at night. What is this? How is it that the footage has gone blank exactly at the time of Roshan's murder? There was power cut yesterday. CCTV doesn't work if there is power cut. Do you believe this?! Is it sir?! I didn't know. Go further. How many guests were there yesterday? Five. Show their footages. Who is this person? He is taking selfies everywhere. Guest. Name? - Makali Bhujanga Gowda. It was the name given by my family. But everyone call me Bro. Why? Need a cool name for FB, Insta page. So I call myself Bro. What is that Insta? Insta... Don't you know Instagram? What do you do in it? Photo blogger. Take a photo shoot with a model every week. And then upload it in Insta page. What is the use of it? Fame. Likes, followers. Do you know one thing? I have hundred thousand of followers for my Insta page. Super. Many girls follow me to take a selfie with me. Then you are one sort of celebrity. You build up and show off in your area. Very good... But no one knows me in my area. Then what sort of a celebrity are you? Bro, this is online matter. It is difficult for me to explain about this to you. Oh! Online? Our cyber crime branch was saying that there is a terrorist, who looks like a kid lost in a fair, but applies make up and posts fake messages in Facebook. He must be that terrorist. No, bro! - Get up. Do I look so cheap? Call me sir. Shivaji sir. Okay bro. - Hey! Sorry sir. What are you hiding? What is that? What is this? - Nothing. I got it in the forest. Why did you go to forest? It seems there is something queer in this place. So madam from the site brought me here to take photos for a documentary. Unmarried bachelors here go missing suddenly since last 5 years... Under very mysterious circumstances. What do you mean by mysterious? They say black magic practices are increasing. Hearsay... Have you seen it personally? No sir. Actually I am not well since I came here. A sort of... Sorry sir. Acidity. So... You say that you were inside the room yesterday night and did not go out. Yes sir. I was sleeping. Sir, I think we can make her talk if we call our constable Saroja here. Sir, coffee. I asked for coffee and you have given. Why are you still standing here? Get out! What is this? - Sir! It is my personal diary. We are investigating a murder. Nothing is personal here. You have been staying in this resort since 3 days and Roshan stayed in the room beneath this floor. But you say that you did not see him at all. I was sleeping. I had this terrible nightmare. Bad dream. Dreamt as if a woman is following me near the well. Felt she was looking at me. Calling my name. 'Surekha!' Just weird sir. Something is not right. And something about this place... - Sir. I feel this madam and Bro are the killers. They are just pretending about documentary. Sir! - Wait. What is that about well? What sort of a hotel is this? Very shabby! I told you to book a hotel in another place. And we will get a good hotel. He didn't listen to me. - Hello. What happened? Who are you? - Madam! Who am I?! - Yes. He is from police department. Has come for investigation. Please madam. ACP Shivaji Surathkal, crime branch. I am so sorry sir. Sir, please go and look at the balcony sir. Disgusting. Please go. Wait. Where are you going? Clean it. It is so dirty... Bhat! Room No 1005. Come fast. - Okay. Sir, did you see that? Such things are happening frequently. This resort and this place... Not alright. I can't sleep at night. Feel like someone is knocking the door. But no one is there if I open and see. If such things had happened in San Diego, they would have cancelled the hotel license. It will affect every living being, you know. Mister! Why are you silent? Any problem? Sir, he doesn't know Kannada. Doesn't know? - Yes. Why? Sir, I will write a negative review about this hotel. This place is haunted. It is scary. Soukhya! Don't exaggerate. No Som. I can't stay here any longer. Let us get back. Sir, can we leave this hotel? Hello! A murder investigation is going on here. Nobody is allowed to leave this place. And trust me madam, If you are genuine, you will definitely fly back home. Sir, he doesn't know Kannada. I feel he is the killer. I have to do all the work here. Are you Bhat? Yes sir. People are scared to come to this resort. But you have been working here since long. Why this loyalty? Sir, I am single. I had two daughters. 2nd daughter died. Have taken lot of loan. Owner pays me salary in time. So I work here. Few pigeons have died and fallen in that room balcony. Not few. Look here. Bad time for me on full moon days. Pigeons die in lots here. I bury them here. What else can I do? It is so strange! Weird incidents happen in Ranagiri often. Cannot find reasons for some of the incidents. Even if there is a reason, you will not tell. Right? That... Wait! - Why? Sir, please don't lift it. This is a well. There is some problem with this. Please sir. - What problem? 'Ji!' - Problems are not few... Why this thread? All of you have tied it. This... Our guest Vidyasagar tied this. I am able to sleep well at night after he tied this to me. Why are you giving colorful threads to everyone? It is not a colorful thread. It is for protection. Protection from whom? I am a professional palm reader. The color of the thread depends on the lines in their palms. We do not want to know its rules. It is not a rule. It is a fact. There is close connection between your life and the lines in palm. Can predict a person's past, present and future from this. You look at the palm and predict a person's future. We are from department. We will know the full details of a person by looking at his face. Do you know? I think you do not believe my words. Tell me your birth date. Say. No problem. 10th January. 1001. Reflective number. Show your hand. You are searching for someone. But... We have come for investigation. Where is the question of searching? Everyone knows the reason. I am not saying that. This is an old incident. You have not got the person you are searching for. Path to the aquarium. 'It was 2 O'clock in the afternoon.' 'I started enquiring the neighbors if they saw Janani.' Madam, greetings. I am Janani's husband. She is not there in the house. Did you see her? Did you see? Today? Where did you see? Did she go out? Where did she go alone? She doesn't go. Did she go with someone? With whom? Did she go in a car? Which vehicle? Auto? Or Cab? Which vehicle? At least... Which color was it? Red. Blue, yellow, green. Which color vehicle? Which color was it? White color vehicle? White color vehicle. Which one? Ambulance. A life-changing incident happened in your life 3-4 years back. You are in extreme sorrow because of that. 1001. Two more days. A trouble awaits you. But it will not be because of humans. Believe me. Wear this red thread. You will get peace of mind and escape from the threat. Govindu! - Sir... Did you observe a point about that palmist? We went to enquire him. But he provoked our feelings. He is playing some mind game. Understand? Sir, he is the killer. Confirm. Earlier you said Bhat is the killer. Before that you said the girl is the killer. Sir, this is double confirm. Good coffee. Why did you bring it? Sit down. Please sit. Thank you. Is it okay? Madam, you have to tell us whatever you know. Should not lie. We cannot show you 'Bhagwat Gita' to take oath. Understand? Mr Govindu! - Yes sir. I had told Rudresh to get my tablet. Enquire him about that. - Okay sir. Go and call from a distance. Alright sir. Why are you doing work in this condition? You can go to your mother's place and relax. Sir, we have staff problem. Pritam will be left alone. That is why. Alright. What exactly happened yesterday? Anything unusual? Did anything strange happen? Did you observe anything? Do not hesitate because I am a police. Tell me honestly. Please. I was in reception yesterday night. Got a call from Roshan's room. Hello! Hello! Pritam! 'Smita!' So... You say that Roshan ran out of the room. Why did he run? Did you see from whom he ran away? No. I didn't see anyone. According to Smita no one was seen. Not seen means... What is it mean? Think. Just think... Think like Roshan. You are very scared. Came running out of the room. What will he do first? Will call my girlfriend. Exactly. He must have done the same thing. Hello! Darling! He was going this side. Why did he turn and walk towards the pool? He saw someone there. Got scared and ran. Sir... No problem. He must also have dashed against the pillar just as me. Yes. A mark in the watch. Was there a mark in the watch? Thank God! You did not ask what? Watch was there and there was a mark in it. The reason was... This Pillar. Look there! There is a mark. You are a genius sir. I know... Who scared Roshan? Who is that...? That is the only missing link. Post mortem report says death was by drowning. An expert swimmer cannot drown unless... The Killer must have pushed him down in water and killed him. Exactly. But Smita says that she saw only Roshan and not anyone else. Which means we have a mysterious killer. That person brought Roshan out of the room, forcibly drowned him in swimming pool and killed him. But nobody could see the killer. A bull killer! Who is that killer? 'Govindu and I roamed the whole day.' 'But did not get any information about Janani.' 'But the next day at 3 O'clock in the morning.' Sir, gas is getting wasted. Petrol rate is high. Light it. - Sir...! Sir no... - Loafer! This is my wife's mobile. From where did you steal it? - I will tell the truth. I was drinking tea in the shop. A mobile fell from an ambulance. If Manja was telling the truth, who threw the mobile from the ambulance? Whose ambulance was it? Something is terribly wrong. Remember that incident properly. Tell me in detail about whatever you saw there. Tell. - Sir... I do not remember anything else. Govindu! - Sir! I think he doesn't know why government has banned plastic! Sir! I will tell one thing. A dog died after getting hit by the ambulance. What? This dog? I promise. I saw the same dog. Sir, it is our Gulma. 'May 16th, 4 O'clock in the morning...' 'As per Manja's information,' 'I and Govinda went to the place where the mobile fell.' 'We searched there for some information.' 'Then...' Sir! See here. Our Gulma... 'May 16th 5.30 a.m.' 'I lost my dear friend Gulma.' 'Forever.' 'Good boy! Jump!' 'Come on Gulma! Jump!' Sir, there is a fire. Fire! Where? Extinguish the fire! Spray with force. Extinguish the fire fully. Shivaji Surathkal. What is this? What have you thrown in it? How did the sofa catch fire? Don't know. Caught fire automatically. How is it possible? No wires for short circuit, no kerosene nearby, no matchstick here. How did it catch fire? Whose room is this? That documentary girl? Yes sir. Where is she? - Don't know. Saw fire from the window. Use our master key to open the door and came inside. What is this box? Open it. - No sir! It is cursed. Curse. No! You open it. - Sir, no sir. Should not touch it sir. Open it. - Sir! No! No sir. Whose photo is this? Why are you staring at each other's face? Who is this? Sir! - Say. That is 'Moggine Jade' (Braid adorned with flowers) Ranganayaki's photo. Who is she? 'There is a reason for people getting scared of Ranagiri.' 'This is an old story.' 'Many people who practiced sorcery, ' 'black magic, human sacrifice lived here.' 'People were scared of coming out of their houses at night.' 'It was Ranganayaki who made it an' 'everlasting feeling among the people.' 'She grew up normally like other kids.' 'But nobody married her since she was dumb.' 'So she started doing sorcery and started enticing boys.' 'She sacrificed Pigeons and drank its milk.' 'On full moon days, she dressed up like a bride,' 'wore anklets and scared unmarried boys.' 'Then she taunted them. Then she killed them in a horrific way.' 'Even now many boys who travelled have gone missing.' 'Ranganayaki is responsible for that.' 'Only day she killed Patel's son.' 'As revenge, he formed a group of men,' 'chased her towards the well and killed her.' 'But the troubles did not end.' 'From next full moon day many boys went missing.' 'People said Ranganayaki's ghost is the cause for it.' 'So they performed her final rites,' 'put all her clothes in a box and threw it.' We did not have any trouble for few years. But someone opened this trunk few years back. So bachelors go missing in Ranagiri. Now we saw that this trunk is here. Let us throw it at the earliest. - Hey! This box is an important evidence for this case. Keep it in my room. - Sir, No! It is an act off ghost. You will also be in trouble. Are you scaring me? I am sending it to my room. Not yours. I will be in trouble. Not you. - No sir... Right. Let this matter be rested. First of all how did this trunk appear in this room? That... - Bro... Sorry sir. I know. Site madam brought this snake skin, old trunk, cat's hair and many other items for black magic documentary shoot and kept them in this room. It must be the effect of this. She used to walk everywhere at night. When I ask, she pleaded ignorance about it. You mean sleep walk? Yes sir. I told you sir. Look! She is standing there. Like the fishes that sleep with eyes open! Sir, every day night madam stands in the balcony for a long time. I am seeing since 3 days. Roshan fell into the pool here. She is in the direct line of sight. That means I have an eye witness. But she is sleeping. I want you to relax, Surekha. This is a scientific procedure. I will help you to recollect whatever happened in your sleep. See this. Focus. You are getting sleep. Go to sleep. Good. Yesterday night you were walking in sleep. You came to the end of corridor. What did you see there? Swimming pool. Good. Roshan came running towards swimming pool. Yes. Someone followed him. - Yes. Chased him, drowned Roshan and killed him. Yes. Who was it? Who killed him? Was it a man or woman? Where did the person go after killing him? To the well. Who was it? 'Two more days. A trouble awaits you.' 'But it is not because of humans 1001.' Saw your photos in Roshan's Instagram. I think you were very close. We were to be engaged in 4 months. What happened to him? Cannot say anything clearly for now. But the incidents happening here... What happened, sir? Did you hear the sound? 'Shivaji!' - What sort of sound? 'Will you marry me?' Didn't hear any sound. Right. Leave that matter. You and Roshan wanted to get married. Do you doubt anyone? I doubt someone after this incident. Why did Roshan come here? Something not right about the place, sir. 'Ji!' 'Will you marry me?' Sir tea! I told you to order Coffee. Coffee powder is over. You give tea if we ask coffee. Get cold water in place of hot water. Pigeons flying high have fallen down. What is this nonsense? You may go. Thanks. Sir. Shall we throw all this out as Bhat said? Why? Are you scared? Sir, you do not understand. What? Roshan was unmarried. - Yes. Came out of the room alone. He went near the wretched well. It was a full moon day. Ranganayaki's ghost must have... So... Like them do you also say that a ghost killed him? It is the truth. Only you cannot see it. Really? Shall I tell one thing? - Sir. Ghost, vampires, etc are only our imagination. Fear has a thousand forms. It is like that. You look for ghost and vampires in Google. How can I explain to you? I will tell one thing if you will not scold me. Tell. Sir. This place Ranagiri is not alright. Let us give up this case. Let us go back to our place. What nonsense are you talking? We work for department. We should be practical. Who will believe us if we talk about ghost? 'Ji! Will you marry me?' Power is fluctuating. Go and check the fuse. 'Open the door.' 'Follow me. Come.' 'Follow me. Come to me.' 'Shivaji!' You! 'Ji! Will you marry me?' 'Roshan killed me.' 'What happened, Ji?' 'Ji!' 'Listen to me.' 'Will you marry me?' 'Ji! What shall we name our child?' 'Two more days.' 'You will be in trouble. - Ji!' 'You're not going well. - You will be in trouble.' 'But it will not be because of humans'. 'If she is dead...' 'Shivaji...' 'Where is murder the weapon?' 'Invisible killer...' '1-2... - Come on.' 'Ji, you are perfectly alright.' Don't you have coffee? Will get in the afternoon. Please adjust. Will give you in the afternoon. Sir. I do not drink tea or coffee. My drink is different. Sir what happened? I saw her yesterday. Who? I saw her. Who? Ranganayaki. Sir, you saw... It was she. The incidents happening here are because of her. The people here are saying the truth. They said she will first scare us. Then she will turn us mad. And finally she will kill. All that is happening to me. She scared me there. When I went near the well... 'Moggine Jade' Ranganayaki was standing there. I went near and saw. It was not Ranganayaki. She was my Janani. My Janani. She resembled Ranganayaki. She walked strangely like Ranganayaki. - Sir... She is turning me mad. Then she will kill me tomorrow. Sir you said... - Just as she killed Roshan. We should leave this place Sir... - as soon as possible. This place is dangerous. - You said there are no ghosts or vampires. And we should be practical. - Yeah. Listen... I am also rational. Okay? I told you. I told you yesterday evening. But I experienced it at night. I saw her. I saw Ranganayaki. Listen to me. - I saw her. It was dark yesterday night. You must have seen something else. You have not slept properly since 2 days. And you have not taken tablets also. You are saying I am mad. - No sir. You think I am imagining things. I am just imagining. Am I mad? - I did not mean it sir. I am saying I saw Ranganayaki standing there. No sir. - Do you say it is only my imagination? I did not say so. - Then what do you mean? I mean... - Spirits and ghosts are there. Sir, I do not mean that. You had not taken tablets. Just shut up and go. Bullshit! Go. Out! 'Ji, are you unable to differentiate between the truth and false?' Since yesterday everything... Hey! What is happening here? Sir, what happened? That... My hand slipped and tea cup fell down. What happened? - Look there. Your hand did not slip. You have a problem. No! What problem? I have no problems. Look! Your hand is shaking. - No problem. You look so weak. - No. I am perfectly okay. What is wrong with me? - Your pupils are dilated. No problem. Why? Are you not getting sleep? No. I am perfectly okay. I am okay... They all are laughing. Let us go down and talk. Please... Please. I don't know what is happening here. What sort of a person is he? I feel sad to hear about your wife. That is why you have clinical depression. I do not have depression. Of course I cannot sleep properly at night. I have anger issues since birth. But the incidents which happened yesterday and day before... What happened? The Voice... The Wretched well... Leave it. Being a psychiatrist, I can see you have a problem. Like... You are seeing things which others do not see. You are hearing things which others do not hear. You think it is extraordinary memory power or something else? Sir, your tea is getting cold. Drink. Personally I feel you need a break. How can I take a break? You know this is a serious case. How can I leave it and go? But how will you solve it when your mind is not clear? As a doctor, it is a personal suggestion. Take a break. At least for a few hours. You will feel much better. You are right. Rudresh! Sir! Sir... How is it that you are going to my mother's house? Is it because the new girl, a doctor, told you? Come on Janu! You also think like normal girls. Then why? You were avoiding my family all these years. Why are you going there suddenly now? What is the matter? Have you started? You are a lawyer. How can I argue with you? I don't want to have this conversation. Okay. Shall we play music? - Yes. Oh! Your favorite song. - Yes. Ji! 'Hello! Police control room?' 'Bunty and his friend are kidnapping in an ambulance.' 'The Lawyer is wearing green shawl.' 'Around 28-30 years old.' 'She is pregnant.' 'I cannot say more. Sorry.' 'But the information is 100% true.' 'I am really sorry.' Our additional branch... Some anonymous call. Can we consider it a kidnap case on that basis? We want proper evidence. You are emotional because it is your wife. Do one thing. Apply for one week's leave. Patil will handle this case. Patil! - Thank you sir. But why sir? No buts. It is my order. You can go now. 'May 16th around 1 O'clock...' 'I started off the record investigation' 'to collect information about Bunty who kidnapped Janani.' This is Janani's number. Okay. Find out with whom she talked last. One minute sir. This number. He has called repeatedly. Check whether you can get the call recordings. One minute sir. 'Hello! Madam! Heard you have taken up a new case yesterday.' 'Got information from your office.' 'Who are you? Why are you bothered?' 'Influential people are involved in this.' 'Better leave this case. Let us come to a compromise.' 'Will come to your house if you need settlement.' 'What do you say? - Settlement! My foot! Hang up.' Bastard! How dare he threaten her? Just find who he is. It must be Bunty. Check. No sir. His name is Peter Tom. No.33, BB Mohalla, Mysore. Why? Why did you threaten my wife? Tell me. Who is Bunty? - Leave me. What is your relationship with him? Tell me. Will pull out your ears. Tell. - I did not call anyone. Sir, leave him. - Who is Bunty? We do not have warrant. He may die. Sir, lost my phone 2 weeks back. Then why did you run on seeing us? I am scared of police. Sir, Leave him. He is not the person. Get lost! Get lost! - Idiot. Go! 'Dummy ambulance was used to kidnap.' 'Janani got threatening call from a stolen phone.' 'Not even a small clue from CCTV footages.' 'Looks like someone who is aware ' 'of police procedures must have done this.' Is it?! Do you mean to say that there is a mole in our department? I mean why it should not be a person from our department? Cannot believe anyone. Now we should leave our regular police investigation route and use some other network. How? Informer network. It must be here. The ambulance in which Janani was kidnapped must be here. Aslam Bhai's information has never been wrong. Sir, all are of white color. How can we search from this? Sir! Govindu! Are you okay? The car has gone! - You are alright? It was aimed at me. - Forget it. Bunty has escaped. Do not leave him. We can find out madam. It is sticking here. - Where? Here. Something sticky here. Govindu! - Sir! You are a genius. 'May 16th , 3.30 p.m.' 'could find the ambulance in which Janani was kidnapped' 'but not Janani.' Janani always used to say that you like this dish very much. When did I come here? You came early in the morning and slept off. I did not try to wake you up. Did I drive the car? Yes. Why? Excuse me. Just... Hello! - Sir, could get hold of the missing driver. Is it? Excellent. I will come there right now. - Okay sir. Hold him. - Okay sir. Eat breakfast and go. - No. I have to go now. Please. You are coming here after many years. Why are you in a hurry to go? I came to Madikeri for a case. Have some urgent work. Will come some other day. - I will pack it. No. Excuse me. No. Thanks. Please. Shiva! Shiva! Sorry. Bye. Sir, he is the missing driver. His name is Anwar. Right? - Yes sir. Hey! He! How dare you? - Sir... Sir... What are you doing? He has come here right after meeting with an accident. His pulse rate is very bad. You please calm down. - I will calm down, madam. I am investigating an important case. Are you playing tricks with me? - Sir... Your boss was murdered 2 days back. Where did you go? Where did you go? Sir... Stop that drama. Sir! Just a minute. - Shut up. I told you not to speak harshly since he is an accident victim. Look what happened now! If he is an accident victim he should have been taken to hospital. Who brought him here? - I brought him. Why did you bring him? I have to follow senior officer instruction. Who is that senior officer? - You! He came from the right side and hit the trunk. Idiot! Diffuse that spot. No need to go to hospital. You will be in problem if my vehicle no. is mentioned in FIR. Delete his mobile recordings. He is driver Anwar. I don't care. Clear the crowd. - Hey! Disperse... Go! What are you blabbering? Have you gone crazy? When did I say? Why are you lying? Sir, please... He may be lying. But you can tell the truth. You know the truth. You advised me to take a break. I said okay. So I went with my wife to my In-law's place. When I was enjoying my trip with my wife, this idiot dashed against the car. With wife? Oh! With wife! Oh! With wife! Today morning he was saying that his wife died 4 years back. But now... You are imagining things, sir. - Anjali! Miss Anjali, I shared my past and feelings with you since you are a doctor. You do not twist it and fabricate a new story. Okay? Please do not manipulate. No... - No... You are hallucinating. No... - You seem to have memory issue. I don't have any problems and my memory is perfect. Oh! Really? - Yes. Okay. You were travelling happily and there was an accident. - Yes. Then what happened yesterday night? Yesterday night we were talking about the suspect in your boyfriend Roshan's murder. Power went off. - Sir, I will go and check. Govind went that side and I went the other side. When I went near the pool, that boy Makaligowda, he fell into the pool. I stretched my hand to save him. Hello! When did I fall into the pool? You have also become a psyche like our madam here. Didn't you fall into the water? - No. Do not lie. - Why should I tell lie, Bro? Do not call me Bro. I have told you many times not to address me like that. Call me Shivaji. - Leave him. You killed the minister's son and are trying to frame me. Sir! - Why are you beating me? I am Shivaji... - Sir! Surathkal! I am sure. Loafer! Bengali Tiger! How dare you record this? Get out of my sight. What's happening? What is happening here? Keep quiet. Why are you interfering? - Stop. He says he was hypnotized. That boy fell in pool yesterday night. You are not mentally stable sir. You are not fit to investigate this case. You have a problem. - I have no problems. You have a problem. I don't have any problem. - Sir, please... I will give you just one hour time. Get out of here otherwise... You have a problem. You have become a psyche. Ranganayaki scares... Makes people crazy... Kills. It is a bad time for you, sir. Govindu! - Sir... Pack the bags. - Alright sir. Let us leave. What is this? I miss something... I miss something... What is it? Well... 'Have I become crazy as he said?' 'She scares. Makes us mad... Kills.' 'I am missing some clue.' 'Missing a clue.' 'Open the door.' 'Come on.' 'Could not see anyone.' 'What do you mean by that?' 'Something is wrong. Something...' 'Wrong... - Ranagiri!' 'Something is wrong.' 'What is it that I am missing?' 'Well...' 'Do not open the well.' 'Don't open.' 'Do not open the well.' Sir! One hour over. For the 1st time I feel that I have lost. I am unable to come to a logical conclusion to this case. As they say, there is no logic for the incidents happening in Ranagiri. To me the case is closed. Have you packed the luggage? Ready sir. Let us start Bye Bro. Bye. - Thank you sir. Sir. - Sir, safe journey. Thank you. See you. Take care of your health. Be safe. Okay sir. - Bye. Thanks. - Take care. Bye sir. - Clear your loans soon. Alright sir. Sir, I left the car keys in the room. Go and get it. Wait! Sir. What did you say? - I left the keys in the room. 'Left the keys in the room, sir.' Govindu! Sir! - You are a genius. What happened, sir? He is coming back. He is back. Pritam. - Sir. He has left the car keys in the room. Will you give the master key? Sure sir. Take. Thank you. Why are you going that side? Our room is in this side. Is it? Then here? It is Roshan's room. - I have to go there. Come. What? Govindu! - Sir. How many times have we come to Roshan's room? This is the 2nd time. - Who opened the door last time? Pritam. - How? With this Key. - Exactly. Then which key is that? A room has 2 keys. One is with the customer and the other a master key which is with the hotel. 'I used the master key and came in.' Roshan's key is here. It means Roshan did not get out of the room. But the body was found in the pool. Postmortem report says that death was by drowning. 'Postmortem says he died of drowning.' 'Body was found in the pool. But he did not leave the room. How?' It says he died of drowning. But it is not necessary that he drowned in the pool. It might have happened here. How is it possible in this room? Here means... There. Yes. The murderer drowned Roshan in this bathtub and then shifted his body to the swimming pool. You mean like the famous 'Sridevi' case. Roshan weighed 100 Kgs. How is it possible to drown and kill him in the bathtub so easily? You have a point. Why didn't Roshan attack back when the killer attacked him? The gun was nearby. But he did not use it. Why? Think. Roshan knew the attacker. And the attacker made Roshan a dummy before drowning him. How is it possible? - Weakness... He knew Roshan's weakness and misused it. What was his weakness? What was Roshan's weakness? Sir... - Please I am thinking. Shut up... Asthalin. Missing object. Asthalin inhaler. Roshan was an Asthma patient. They hid his inhaler and made him suffer from Asthma attack. The fact is if strong deodorants are used in rooms, the Asthma patients get attack. Point. Asthma, Asthalin. These are personal details. Who knew about it? Who? Family, family friend, family doctor. Or a close friend with medical knowledge. Exactly. Who is it? - Dr Anjali. Am I a suspect now? What happened? - This is what happened. Killer Dr Anjali. Murder weapon is deodorant spray. She knew he was asthmatic, misused it and made him dummy. But... Something is wrong. How did Anjali shift Roshan who weighed 100 kgs from the bathtub? Anjali did not kill him alone. She had an accomplice. Someone helped her and that person is lying to me. Who is that person? Pritam! What did Pritam say? I had to go and call SI Rudresh. But when we sat in the same car next day, he adjusted the seat. So the person who drove before him was shorter than him. It is some other person. Who was it? Anwar! Anwar, Pritam and Anjali together committed the murder. Anwar and Anjali will escape. Pritam will be in resort. Anwar was missing since 2 days. They said so. But he never went missing. They have planned it together. But Rudresh was searching for him. He didn't go missing. Then how will Rudresh get him? He is also part of the gang. Do you say he fixed us in spite of being in our side? Yes. SI Rudresh was posted in Ranagiri 3 months back. Anwar joined as Roshan's driver 3 months back. So it was all preplanned. Anjali, Anwar, Pritam, Rudresh. Total 4 persons are killers. And of course Ranganayaki. Someone has created a ghost named Ranganayaki. Who told that story first? 'This has been done by a spirit.' The persons who confirmed it are Bro and Eureka. 'Well...' The persons who supported them and validated it... 'Felt as if someone knocked at my door.' 'This place is haunted, sir.' NRI Soukhya Ajjampura and her Bengali husband Somjit. Soukhya! Don't exaggerate. That Bengali is an electrical engineer. So lights flicker in the entire building. 'Why have you tied colorful threads to everyone?' 'It is not a thread. It is for protection.' He said your time is bad. Ranganayaki is a ploy. It is drama. But you saw Ranganayaki. I cannot understand only that. I saw that ghost. You did not see. Isn't it? - No sir. I could see but you did not. I was affected but you were not affected. Then you have not done something which I did. They have used it. What is that? 'Sir, tea.' Tea Govindu. I drink coffee but they were supplying me tea often. You do not drink coffee or tea. - My drink is different. So they mixed some medicine which will create anxiety. Some hallucination. 'Clinical depression.' They knew I have anxiety problems. And they knew that my tablets are exhausted. They also knew that I have informed Rudresh to get those tablets. So when I was weak, they induced some drug to me and made me imagine things. So Ranganayaki was just an imagination. Sir, all of them targeted you. - Yes. They were smart. But I am smarter. I am Shivaji Surathkal. When Roshan was in the room... Who is it? Anjali! Give the Asthalin. Anjali! What are you doing? Catch him. Hurry up. Who are you? Leave me. Lift him. - I am home minister's son. Leave me. Anjali! - Come on. I can't breath. - Quick... Leave me. Leave. Come. Careful... Come on. Push him. Run! - Run fast. Let's go. So the murder was not committed by one or two persons, 11 persons have committed it. Wicked people. An entire cricket team. Call SP and minister. Tell the case investigation is over and he can come to Ranagiri. Let me update score card to the cricket team! Stars shine in darkness. Truth also shines in the same way. The more you hide it, it will come out with force and prick our eyes. It is logical to have one murderer in a murder case. But 11 persons have joined and committed the murder. Wow! Great team work People. Did you think that if everyone says the same lie, people will believe it? What is it called in Psychiatry? Yes. Gas light effect. You almost made me believe it by saying that I am crazy and imagining things. Great team, people! But remember one thing. You may deceive anyone in life except two persons. One is your conscience and the other is Shivaji Surathkal. But one question. If you are one team, what is the connection amongst you all? You cannot be friends because you belong to different age groups. You do not belong to the same native, because your accents are different. You do not work in the same place. You are not friends family or colleagues. But what is the connection? Can you say Mrs Soukhya Ajjampura? Daughter of Srinivasa Ajjampura. Your father was a popular stage artist. He died in 2006 on stage due to heart attack. Correct? May his soul rest in peace! You were running that drama troupe after he died. You all were doing different characters in that drama troupe. You are all actors. Artists! It is easy to apply make- up and act as killer on stage. But you have committed a cold blooded murder in real life. How? And people like you. And you. You... You are all middle class people. You get scared even when there is police verification for passport. But you have planned and killed a person... There must be a strong reason for that. What is the motive? Why did you kill? Personal revenge? Vengeance. What is the reason? Why did you kill? Eureka Lobo D/o Valerian Lobo alias Bhat. They call you 'Bhat'. Is it because you cook well? When we met 1st time you said that after your last daughter died... Last daughter... If she is the 1st daughter, who is the last daughter? Tell me. Come on. No! Sir, please do not harm him. Please. Jessica... Jessica is my sister. She was 16 years old. Yes. Jessica was blind. But no limits to her dreams. She was the centre of attraction for our entire group. She entertained everyone. Very lively girl. But she was unable to apply even henna on her own. Such an innocent girl. How could she...? Okay. I get it. But Dr Anjali, you loved Roshan. Why did you join them and commit this murder? Roshan acted differently when he was with his friends. Bunty was a rogue. What did you say? Who is Bunty? Roshan's friends called him Bunty. 'Bunty!' 'But she is pregnant.' Bunty committed 3 murders. It started with Jessica. Hello! Hi Sweetheart! - Bunty, will come home in the evening. Okay sweetheart. I am in a meeting. Cannot hear properly. Will call later. You are a lucky fellow. Your girlfriend believes you a lot. Rakesh, we have to act in front of girlfriend but do as we please. That is why I told you to find a girlfriend. There is a girl in your station. Try to woo her. Her boyfriend is SI. He will harm us if we try. Wicked fellow! Sir, someone told me the bathroom is here. Ladies toilet is the next one. Go there. Thank you. She is blind but did you see her dress! Wicked fellow! Are you thinking what I am thinking? Anyone can harm her here. Nobody can identify. She is very young. Come. I am the striker and you are non-striker. Let us go. Sir! Who is that? Who is here? Who is that? Who is that? Please. Sir. Leave me! - Catch her... Leave me! Come on. - Leave me! Help! Help! Bunty! What did you do? She is dead. - What? What happened? - She is dead. What to do now? - I have an idea. Let us change the place of death. Come on. Bring her. Rakesh used police influence and shifted Jessica's body to government hospital. Sister, what happened actually? What is the cause of death? Sir, that... How can I tell you? - Please say. To say in medical terms, her hymen ruptured and there was plenty of blood loss. She must have been a virgin. Because of forcible and stressful intercourse she had lot of pain, couldn't bear and had cardiac arrest. Is there any other information you can give us? Sorry sir. Since this is police case, you have to speak to SI Rakesh. Can't help you. - Okay doctor. Thank you. Lobo, come with me. You know that girl. I can understand your sorrow. But case is closed. - Case closed! How can you close the case? - How can the case be closed? That girl's dead body was lying on the road. I brought it to hospital. Someone raped her and dumped her on the road. The girl was wearing a revealing dress. Mister! Do not comment on Jessica's character. Wonder who she was with! She was a gem of a girl. - Oh! Feeling for her! Is there something between you and the girl? What nonsense is he saying! - Sir! Mind your words. What are you talking? Sir, no use talking with him. I know a Lawyer. Let us file a case. Truth will be proved in court. Go! - Let's go. We know how to handle court and lawyers. Go! We have contacts everywhere. Pritam knows a lawyer. - Yes sir. We can talk to her and see. Will call her now. Don't worry sir. I will take up the case. But we need a strong witness. Spoke to lawyer. She feels it will be better if we have a witness. Where can we search for witness? I am there as witness. You? I am Anjali, Roshan's girlfriend. I am sorry. I was terribly scared. Didn't know how to handle the situation. Why are you apologizing? Now I know what happened to my sister. That is enough. Sir, give me the lawyer madam's number. I will go and meet her. I went to her house to meet the lawyer. I saw Bunty again there. Hello! Police control room? Bunty and his friend... In an ambulance... The Lawyer is wearing green shawl. I cannot say more. Sorry. I am telling 100% truth. After 2 days I came to know that Bunty committed 2 more murders. He has killed lawyer madam. She was the only one to support us. Now he has killed her. Roshan and his father are very influential. They killed Rakesh and spread stories that he is responsible for the other murders. 25000 rape cases are being filed in India every year. But how many are punished? Isn't there Justice? Are those two lives unworthy? How can we fight for justice? They have money. What do we have? We are there. Yes. Intelligence is mightier than physical strength. If we decide, we can do anything. Then let us kill the wicked Roshan. But who will kill him? - I will kill. I have no one. I have nothing to lose. What the hell are you talking? Commit murder? We? We have family. Do you know the consequences if police know about this? They indulge in such heinous act because we remain quiet. Before other girls are harmed... - Let us kill the bloody bastard. He killed my sister and lawyer. Let us scare him and kill. We will kill Roshan. Sir, if you still want to arrest us, arrest only me. Because 2 crimes happened in front of my eyes, but I couldn't stop them. What would you have done if Jessica was your sister? Or if the lawyer was your wife, what would you have done? The lawyer is my wife. Her name is Janani. She was 7 months pregnant when she was murdered. Since last 3-4 years, I have been searching for her killer. Now I know that my wife gave up her life fighting for an innocent girl. Thank you. Thanks to you. And... Thank you all. Anyway, as a police officer, I cannot justify the murder committed by all of you together. You will be punished as per law. Shit! Ji! Why are you so confused? Jaanu! I had promised you that I will find out your killer and punish them. Now Roshan has been punished. But I cannot agree to the way the punishment was given. They have planned and committed this murder. It is against law. Law did not help when Jessica and I were killed. Come on Jaanu. You are a lawyer. How can you speak against law? Justice and duty are more important than law. We have to find out another route if law doesn't give us justice. Do not argue for the sake of it. They have done a wrong thing. You think they are wrong. But they feel they did a right thing. That's what matters. But still... I cannot justify this. Exactly. Think from your heart. Heart is not as confused as mind. Right means right and wrong means wrong. They have done whatever they felt was right. And you do whatever you feel is right. Welcome sir. - Thank you. Have I seen you somewhere before? Definitely you have seen. You decide the fate of policemen like us. Rakesh death case... Yes. Sorry. I have become aged. So forgot. But I have not forgotten. Nice. You are... Shivaji Surathkal. Oh! Shivaji Surathkal? - Yes sir. You solve crimes with imagination. Sir! - Tell me. It was his wife who died. I am very sorry. Really. FIR says Rakesh was the only person guilty. But it is not so. There are two masks. There are 2 Pizza covers. Two persons committed the murder. Not one. Two? - Yes, sir. One is Rakesh from our department. I have heard the other person's voice in my wife's call trace. He speaks with Telugu accent. His name is Bunty. Bunty! Yes sir. Rakesh and Bunty kidnapped my wife and brought her here. Something happened here. Bunty killed my wife with a rod. Rakesh objected to it. Bunty... - Bunty got angry and killed him. Then he planted evidence that Rakesh is the killer and escaped from there. I will not spare him. I will catch that bastard Bunty within 48 hours. Shiva relax... - I will finish that bastard. You are emotional because it is your wife's case. I perfectly understand. - Go there. Send them away. - Go away. Who allowed them inside? - Media has already come here. Waiting for some information. Just imagine what they will write... You and your wife were childless since many years. Your wife and he had an affair. Your wife was pregnant. They will start gossiping about the father of the child. What nonsense is he talking? It is not his words. He is just saying what media will say. Don't mistake us. Media will cook up stories after death. Who wants it? You have earned the reputation of a sincere officer in this state. If your reputation is spoiled, our department's reputation will also be spoiled. Do we need it? Sir is right. Follow it. Please... Patil... - Yes sir. Just for record. Sign this. Sir, Bunty's name is not there in this. Bunty's final rites should be performed. Concentrate on that. I will take care of this. Listen. - Sir. This is on record. Full investigation must be done off the record. Yes sir. And he should get justice. - Definitely sir. Yes. Sign. Please. Shivaji! Many names are there! Totally 11 persons. Who are they? - It is them. There is an important connection between them and your son's death. What? - Yes. They are witnesses. Then who killed my son? I have written in the report. Murdered by unidentified individual. What do you mean? - Sir. Off the record... I don't know how to say this. One girl. It is actually a supernatural power. This place Ranagiri. No sir. What nonsense is he talking? Nonsense. No sir. It is a fact. She kills unmarried boys on full moon day. Your son was smart. Why didn't you get him married? Will you please shut up? Do not become emotional because he is your son. Shivaji, be practical. - I am very practical. I studied this case from all angles. I did not believe when I heard it. And I did not believe when I saw it. But I experienced it. - What experience? 'May 17th, 2015. 5.00 p.m.' 'That was the last time I heard Janani's voice.' Ji! - Jaanu, where are you? I don't know. - Trace the call. I feel dizzy. - Listen to me. Now... Tell me in detail about your place. Forest. - Okay. Forest. What else? What else do you see nearby? Beer bottles are lying here. Two persons were wearing masks. - Two persons? Can see sacks. - What sacks? Do not stop talking. What else is there? What is the sound that I hear? Can hear train sound. - Yes. Train is going. She is phoning. - Will kill her. But she is pregnant. How dare you sympathize with her? Jaanu, Bunty is behind you. Jaanu! Hello father! A problem here. Again problem? Okay come. I will take care. Ji! 'May 17th 2015.' 'That was the last day I saw Janani.' Jaanu! Jaanu! Jaanu!
