(silence) [SIREN] REMIND ME TO QUIT MY JOB TOMORROW. AND WHAT, MISS ALL THIS FUN? HUH? HA HA! VAPOR BOMBS? DRIVE MUCH? IS THAT BETTER? SHOW-OFF. HA HA HA HA. 50 SAYS HE TAKES US TO GHOST TOWN, HUH? YOU'RE ON. I'M GONNA GET HIM FIRST. OOH. THIS GUY IS GREAT. [SQUEALING TIRES] WHERE'D HE GO? [KEYSTROKES] HE'S RIGHT THERE ON THE SCREEN. [SQUEALING TIRES] [ENGINE STOPS] [SCREECHING TIRES] SO, HOW ABOUT THEM NEPTUNES? AMEN. I'M UP 10 GRAND THIS MONTH. THEY STILL NEED AN OUTFIELD. WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? THEY GOT A GREAT OUTFIELD. HEY, NICK, EVER SEE WHAT A RAT DOES WHEN HE'S CORNERED? NO, BUT I GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. FIRST, HE SHITS HIS PANTS. AND THEN... Criminal: HE WIPES HIS ASS. NANCE! DROP IT! GEE, OFFICER, WAS I REALLY GOIN' THAT FAST? DROP IT. YOU AIN'T GOT NO PLACE TO GO, PAL. NEITHER DO YOU, SHITBAG. NOW DROP THE GUN, OR SHE DIES. JUST DROP THE GUN, AND YOU BOTH LIVE. DON'T DO IT, NICK, HE'LL KILL US BOTH. YEAH, GO AHEAD, OFFICER... MAYBE YOU FEEL LUCKY TONIGHT. YOU GOT A CLEAN SHOT. [GUNSHOT] UHH! [SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE] [RINGING] HEY, HEY, SHITBIRD, YOU FORGET SOMETHIN'? IT'S PAYDAY. I TOLD YOU, SCHRECK, FRIDAY. UH-UH-UH. NO DICE, SWEETHEART. LOOK, YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY. [SIGH] YOU'RE ON A LOSING STREAK, SHITBIRD. YOU SHOULD FIND YOURSELF A NEW TEAM... BEFORE YOU STRIKE OUT... PERMANENTLY. [SIREN] YOU GOT A CLEAN SHOT, NICK. YOU GOT A CLEAN SHOT! [GUNSHOT] Female computer voice: CAUTION. YOU ARE ENTERING A SECURED PERIMETER. PLEASE SUBMIT TO A RETINAL IDENTITY SCAN. I LOVE IT WHEN YOU TALK DIRTY. JAMES NICHOLAS, CUSTODIAL ENGINEER, YOU ARE CLEARED TO ENTER. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME, NICK. HEY, JOHNNY. WELL, IF IT AIN'T THE LEAN, MEAN CLEANING-MACHINE. YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN TELL YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, JOHNNY? HOW'S THAT? WHEN THE BEST OFFER YOU HAD IN 3 YEARS COMES FROM A LASER CANNON. CATCH THE GAME LAST NIGHT? YOU MEAN THE TURKEY SHOOT? LET ME GUESS. YOU BET ON THE TURKEY AGAIN. GOTTA START WINNIN' SOMETIME, RIGHT? Johnny: MORNING, DR. ROYCE. HAVE A NICE DAY, DR. ROYCE. YOU OUGHT TO CHECK THAT OUT, NICK. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT COMPUTER SCIENTISTS. WHAT? LOOSEN 'EM UP WITH A LITTLE ALGEBRA, THEY GO WILD! I THINK I'D HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH THE LASER CANNON. [BUZZING] PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME, DR. ROYCE, HOW CAN YOU MAKE A VIRUS PROGRAM THINK? BY MERGING IT WITH NEUROLOGICAL PROTOPLASMA. THE MENTAL COMPONENT DIRECTS THE VIRUS, MUCH LIKE THE HUMAN MIND DIRECTS ITS THOUGHTS. THE THEORY IS QUITE SIMPLE, MR. OSHIGA. SO A COMPANY, SUCH AS YOURS, WOULD PURPOSEFULLY INTRODUCE THE VIRUS INTO ITS DATABASE-- AFTER THEY'VE PAID US A STANDARD FEE OF COURSE. Mr. Oshiga: OH, OF COURSE. HA HA. BUT INSTEAD OF DESTROYING INFORMATION, THE VIRUS THINKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM, EXPOSING THE SYSTEM'S VULNERABILITIES AND WEAKNESSES AND MAKES ALL THE NECESSARY SAFEGUARDS. LIKE COMPUTER INOCULATION. AH, EXACTLY. HACKERS, CYBERJACKS, ALL FORMS OF INFORMATION DISEASE WILL SOON BE THINGS OF THE PAST. VERY GOOD. IN THEORY. YES, WELL, I THINK THAT JUST ABOUT DOES IT HERE, MR. OSHIGA. WOULD YOU LIKE TO VISIT OUR VIRTUAL REALITY LAB? WE HAVE A BELLY DANCER HOLOGRAM I THINK YOU'D LOVE. WAIT, WAIT. IT APPEARS DR. ROYCE HAS SOMETHING TO SAY. I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT. CONTINUE, DOCTOR, PLEASE. YES, DOCTOR, BY ALL MEANS, PLEASE CONTINUE. THANK YOU. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S A RANDOM ELEMENT THAT WE CAN'T PREDICT. IN HALF OF THE TESTS THAT WE RUN, THE VIRUS SEPARATES FROM THE BIOLOGICAL HOST. IT ONLY SURVIVES FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE LUNCH OF A FEW GIGABYTES OF DATA. I DON'T MEAN TO RAIN ON YOUR PARADE, MR. JERVIS, BUT FACTS ARE FACTS. AND WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO ABOUT THIS... "RANDOM ELEMENT"? WE PROPOSE TO FIX IT. RIGHT, PHILLIP? WE'RE WORKING NIGHT AND DAY, MR. JERVIS. UM, THIS WAY, MR. OSHIGA. [CLEARS THROAT] WHEN YOU WERE 5 YEARS OLD, ALEX, I TAUGHT YOU THAT HONESTY WAS THE BEST POLICY. DID YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT QUITE SO LITERALLY? I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS, DAD, BUT WHAT IF WE CAN'T CONTROL IT? WHAT IF WE'RE IN OVER OUR HEADS? YOU'RE RIGHT, ALEX, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. [ENGINE NOT STARTING] DAMN IT. UH, I CAN PROGRAM AN IBM MAINFRAME NO PROBLEM, BUT GIVE ME AN ELECTRIC MOTOR AND I JUST...DON'T-- POP THE HOOD. THANK YOU. OK, TRY IT NOW. [ENGINE NOT STARTING] OK, OK. OK. YOUR REMOTE'S SHOT. GREAT. WHAT'S MY REMOTE? IT'S THAT LITTLE THING THAT'S ATTACHED TO YOUR CAPACITOR. OH. AND THAT'S SHOT, TOO. WELL, THAT FIGURES. UH, DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS? HAVEN'T I SEEN YOU SOMEWHERE BEFORE? YOU'RE, UH, YOU'RE SKIP, RIGHT? YOU'RE HOWARD'S ASSISTANT UP IN CYBERNETICS. NICK, DOWN IN JANITORIAL. OH. WELL, THAT MUST BE INTERESTING. SO, DID YOU CATCH THE GAME LAST NIGHT? IS THAT ALL ANYBODY CAN TALK ABOUT IS THE GAME? JUST TELL ME ONE THING. HOW CAN A TEAM GO FROM FIRST TO LAST IN ONE SEASON? IT'S CALLED PRACTICE. YOU WANT TO KNOW MY THEORY? LOUSY OUTFIELD. WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? THEY HAVE A GREAT OUTFIELD. YOU KNOW WHAT? HERE'S WHAT I'D DO. I'D SWITCH MORRISON TO THIRD, I'D LET HASHAGADA LEAD OFF, I'D TRADE REDMOP FOR A GOOD BAT BOY, AND I'D BRING UP A COUPLE OF LEFT-HANDERS FROM THE FARM TEAM. I MEAN, STATISTICALLY, BATTERS IN THEIR DIVISION CAN'T HANDLE SOUTHPAWS, RIGHT? IT'S SO LOGICAL, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED IT OUT BY NOW. UH, CAREFUL, YOU'RE DRIFTING INTO FOUL TERRITORY. [HORN HONKING] OH, SHIT! IF YOU EVER GET UP TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, STOP IN AND SAY HI. WHO SHOULD I SAY HI TO? DR...UH, HEH. ALEX. UH! OK, OK. OK, OK. OHH! MAYBE YOU THINK I'M A COMEDIAN. MAYBE THIS IS ALL ONE BIG JOKE TO YOU. MY MONEY?! A BARREL OF FUCKIN' LAUGHS, HUH? WELL, I DON'T HEAR NOBODY LAUGHIN'... SHITBREATH. I CAN GET YOU... 2,000. YOU OWE ME 10 Gs! THAT MAKES YOU OFF BY, WHAT? I THINK WHAT YOU NEEDS... A MATH LESSON. UHH! UHH! UHH! UHH! AH, YOU MOOKS! WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YA? SO, WHAT ARE YOU WEARING? Woman: YOU KNOW WHAT I'M WEARING, KEN. COME ON, I'VE BEEN COOPED UP IN A VIRUS LAB FOR 3 DAYS. HUMOR ME. WELL, I'M WEARING A BLUE POLYESTER R.A.T. UNIFORM WITH THESE FABULOUS STYRENE STRETCH SOCKS AND THE MOST INCREDIBLE DURAPLASTIC WORK BOOTS. ARE YOU HOT YET? I MEANT...UNDERNEATH. HEH, WELL, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT, YOU'LL HAVE TO BUY ME DINNER. WHAT?! I TOOK YOU-- HACKERS. KENJ? HELLO? "ERASING AERIAL GUIDANCE SYSTEM"?! "SYSTEM FAILURE"? LOUSY GODDAMN COMPUTER. NO, GODDAMN IT! [SCREAMING] Female computer voice: WARNING. SKYBUS IMPACT. [ALARM] CURRENTLY, THE DEATH TOLL IN LAST NIGHT'S TRAGIC SKYBUS ACCIDENT STANDS AT 47, WITH OVER A HUNDRED OTHER PEOPLE SERIOUSLY INJURED. BAFFLED INTERWEB OFFICIALS ARE STILL TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE RAPID AIR TRANSIT COMPUTER SYSTEM TO FAIL. PHILLIP. THERE'S NO PROOF, ALEX, THAT OUR VIRUS CAUSED THIS CRASH. KENJI WAS ON THE PHONE WITH SOMEONE AT SKYBUS CONTROL. COINCIDENCE. BULLSHIT! I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT COMPUTER SYSTEMS FAIL ON A REGULAR BASIS. THAT'S WHAT OUR WORK IS ALL ABOUT. PREVENTING-- PREVENTING HACKERS FROM DOING WHAT THEY JUST DID TO US. SUPPOSE IT HAPPENS AGAIN? SUPPOSE OUR VIRUS GETS OUT AND DECIDES NOT TO COME BACK NEXT TIME? YOUR FATHER ASSURES ME IT'S LOCKED UP. IN AN ELECTROMAGNETIC CONTAINMENT FIELD. THE ACCESS CODES ARE KNOWN ONLY TO MYSELF. GOOD. THEN THAT'S SETTLED. NOTHING IS SETTLED, MR. JERVIS. PHILLIP, WOULD YOU SPEAK WITH YOUR DAUGHTER? I TEE OFF WITH MR. OSHIGA IN AN HOUR. I EXPECT THE PROGRESS REPORT ON MY DESK TONIGHT. SO, THAT'S IT? PLEASE, ALEX, TRY TO UNDERSTAND-- WE CAN'T CONTROL IT. WE ARE CLOSE TO A BREAKTHROUGH-- 47 PEOPLE-- AND NOTHING IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT! I'M AN OLD MAN, ALEX. IF THIS SUCCEEDS... THEY'LL REMEMBER ME. AND IF WE DON'T? SO, HOW'D IT GO? TERRIFIC. 47 PEOPLE ARE DEAD, AND JERVIS WANTS A PROGRESS REPORT. I'LL GET ON IT. [SIGHS] OH, GOD... EXCUSE ME. SORRY ABOUT THE MESS. THAT'S OK. THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR, RIGHT? DO YOU EVER JUST WISH YOU COULD GO BACK IN TIME AND DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY? EVERY DAY. HERE. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. UGH! HOW DO YOU DRINK THAT STUFF? PRACTICE. HEH. SURE THIS IS OK, JOHNNY? I DON'T WANNA GET YOU IN TROUBLE. LONG AS YOU SIGNED OUT, NOBODY WILL KNOW NOTHIN'. SUPPOSE THAT SCHRECK CHARACTER COMES LOOKING FOR YOU HERE? TELL HIM I GOT TRANSFERRED. Sportscaster: 4th INNING AT FENWAY, CUBS LEADING 5-0. RODRIGUEZ STILL LOOKING FOR THAT ELUSIVE FIRST WIN OF THE SEASON. YOU GOTTA WONDER RIGHT NOW IF THE MEXICAN'S BEST DAYS AREN'T ALREADY BEHIND HIM... [STATIC] NO. BA-BA-BA-BA-BA-BA-BAAH! HUH? THINK YOU'RE BAD? YOU AIN'T BAD. YOU'RE DEAD, BUT YOU AIN'T BAD. LOOKS LIKE IT'S INVASION OF THE RUG DOCTORS, JOHN. MAYBE THEY CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT JERVIS' HAIRPIECE WHILE THEY'RE AT IT. YEAH, GOOD LUCK. Female computer voice: CAUTION: YOU ARE ENTERING A SECURED PERIMETER. LOOKS LIKE THEY GOT AUTHORIZATION, BUT I NEVER SEEN THIS COMPANY BEFORE. YEAH, I SEE 'EM. I'LL GO LET 'EM IN. RODRIGUEZ WITH THE WIND-UP... [CRACK] HOLY MOLY! LOOKS LIKE IT'S... IT'S OUTTA HERE! OH, MY! NO... NO! Computer: YOU ARE CLEARED TO ENTER. CHECK. HELLO. HI. NEED YOU TO SIGN IN. [RAPID BEEPING] WHERE TO? FOURTH FLOOR. THAT'S FUNNY. AREN'T ANY CARPETS ON THE FOURTH FLOOR. SURE YOU DON'T WANT THE THIRD FLOOR? [BEEP] [ELECTRONIC WHOOSHING] [ARABIAN MUSIC PLAYS] UHH! YEAH, YOU WATCH IT. I'LL BE BACK, OK? [SILENCED GUNSHOT] HEY, YOU WANNA DIE? YOU WANNA DIE?! MOVE! MOVE! BYE-BYE! HA HA HA! BYE-BYE! HA HA HA HA! WHOOO! HA HA HA HA! WHOO-HOO-HOO! COME ON, HURRY UP! GET OUTTA HERE! [ELECTRONIC WHOOSHING] HA HA HA! HA HA HA! WHOO-HOO! GET IN HERE. THIS IS TRAVIS. I'M IN THE SADDLE. HAVE YOU ACTIVATED THE INTRUDER SYSTEM? DONE DEAL, COACH. AIN'T NOBODY COMIN' IN. AIN'T NOTHIN' GOIN' OUT. THAT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU, RAMIREZ BUDDY? HA HA HA HA! OUTSTANDING, NUMB. YOU'RE A GOOD BOY. Terrorist: COME ON, GET IN THERE! [SOBBING] MOVE IT! SHUT UP! WHAT THE HELL? HEY! HEY! SHUT UP! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE? GOOD EVENING, DOCTORS. WHY ARE YOU NOT SMILING? IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT. THIS IS A LAB, NOT A GODDAMNED SIDESHOW! WHO'S IN CHARGE? I AM. [SCREAMS AND GASPS] WRONG ANSWER. GET THE POINT? AH...DR. ROYCE, I PRESUME. OH...THANK YOU. ANYTIME. AAH! [MUSIC STOPS] [MUSIC RESTARTS] CAN'T WIN FOR LOSING. NASSIM, LOOK WHAT I FOUND. ALEX! HA HA! STAY. AND THAT IS... EVERYBODY. GOOD. YOU HAVE YOUR FATHER'S EYES. I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR WORK ON THE INTERNET. WHAT A MARVELOUS INVENTION-- THE FIRST BIOLOGICALLY AUGMENTED COMPUTER VIRUS. BRILLIANT, DR. ROYCE. TRULY BRILLIANT. OF COURSE, THOSE 40 PEOPLE ON THE SKYBUS MIGHT HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT OPINION. WHOO! NOW, THAT MUST'VE KEPT THE CORONER'S OFFICE BUSY FOR QUITE A WHILE. OUR VIRUS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. THAT WAS A COINCIDENCE. FACE IT, PHILIP. YOUR SMART VIRUS OUTSMARTED YOU. WHAT DO YOU WANT? FAIR QUESTION. WE LIVE IN A BRAVE NEW WORLD, DOCTOR-- A WORLD WHERE COMPUTERS CONTROL EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE, FROM NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS TO TRAFFIC LIGHTS, GOVERNMENTS, MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS, THE AVERAGE MAN--ALL SLAVES TO THOSE INVISIBLE PULSES OF INFORMATION, FLOWING THROUGH THE VEINS OF A WORLDWIDE COMPUTER NETWORK. BUT IF ONE MAN POSSESSED A SUPERVIRUS, AND WITH A SINGLE PHONE CALL COULD DISRUPT THE ENTIRE MATRIX-- INDEED, CREATE INSTANTANEOUS GLOBAL CHAOS-- THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO RECKON WITH THIS MAN, WOULD YOU NOT? YOU'RE PLAYING GOD? AFTER TONIGHT, GOD WILL BE LUCKY IF I EVEN RETURN HIS PHONE CALLS. THE QUESTION IS, DR. ROYCE... DO YOU HAND OVER THE VIRUS... OR DO I HAVE TO CREATE A VERY LARGE HOLE IN YOUR FRONTAL LOBE? I CAN'T. WRONG ANSWER, PHIL. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THE VIRUS IS PROGRAMMED INTO A BIOLOGICAL HOST. IT CANNOT SURVIVE OUTSIDE OF THESE COMPUTERS. EVEN IF YOU COULD GET IT OUT, IT'S TOO UNPREDICTABLE. YOU'D NEVER BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT. JUST UNLOCK THE PROGRAM, DOCTOR. I'LL WORRY ABOUT THE DETAILS. OH, SHIT. DEV, ROUND UP THE GUYS. I WANNA BE OUT OF HERE IN 15 MINUTES. HEY, JOHNNY... SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. I WENT TO TAKE A LEAK AND LOCKED MYSELF OUT. LOOKS LIKE RODRIGUEZ'S BIG COMEBACK AIN'T WORTH SHIT, HUH? HEH HEH...HMM? JOHNNY? JOHNNY-- JOHNNY! NO... JOHNNY. [ELEVATOR CHIRPS] THIS JOB GETTIN' TOO EASY FOR ME, MON. WE KNOCK ON THE DOOR, AND THEY OPEN IT WIDE. BOOYAH! LIKE TAKING CANDY FROM A BABY. HA HA HA! SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU, ALEX. IT'S TOO LATE NOW. MAYBE NOT. [KEYSTROKES] [COMPUTER ALARM] NO! [WOMAN SCREAMS] IDIOT! COME HERE, RUNT! HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE? ONE HOUR. WHO KNOWS THE ABORT SEQUENCE? THE MAN YOU JUST MURDERED. AND WHO PROGRAMMED THE SYSTEM? [SNARLS] NO...NO... [SOBBING] SO...YOU CAN BREAK YOUR FATHER'S CODES. AND JUST LET YOU WALK OUT? TO BE OR NOT TO BE? THAT IS THE QUESTION. IT'S A SIMPLE EQUATION, DOCTOR-- IF THE VIRUS DIES, YOU ALL DIE. AND IF YOU GET IT? THEN WE ALL LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER. NOW, YOU'VE GOT 57 MINUTES. TRAVIS TO NASSIM. WE'VE GOT US A STRAY. WHO? LOOKS LIKE A JANITOR. SHIT. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU GOT EVERYONE ON THE LIST. I DID GET EVERYONE ON THE LIST. EXCEPT THE JANITOR. SHUT UP! DEVON. WHAT? MOP IT UP. SHIT. UHH! HOO-HA! HA HA! YOU IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME, JANITOR BOY! OK, WHO ORDERED THE JANITOR SANDWICH? ME. BASEMENT! SHIT! SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK, NICK, HUH? I THINK YOU'RE FUCKED. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. DEVON. GRRR! HOW CLOSE? I-I'VE DECIPHERED THE FIRST SEQUENCE. THERE'S 2 MORE. EXCELLENT, DOCTOR. JUST KEEP REMINDING YOURSELF-- "IF THE VIRUS DIES, I DIE." Devon: NASSIM, I LOST HIM. WHAT? I LOST HIM. DEV, GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE. NUMB... WATCH HER. MY FATHER WAS A SCIENTIST, TOO. NEURO-PSYCHIATRY. YOU SEE, PUSSYCAT... ONE DAY... THERE I WAS... JUST SITTIN' THERE... CUTEST LITTLE BUNDLE OF JOY YOU EVER DID SEE. AND ONE INCISION... RIGHT HERE... RIGHT HERE. [SKIN SIZZLING] BINGO! HA HA HA HA! NO MORE PAIN. YOU LOST A JANITOR? MAYBE HE SHOULD STICK TO CARPET CLEANING. THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD'VE GOT OUT OF THAT BASEMENT, NASSIM. NO WAY. TRAVIS. YEAH? GO INTO THE COMPUTER AND BRING UP THE VENT SYSTEM. ROGER. HEH HEH. YOU GOT IT? GOT IT. YEAH. NOW KEY INTO THE HEAT SENSORS. YOU BETCHA. TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE. HEH HEH! JANITOR MEAT. YEAH. WELL, WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE? NASSIM WAS RIGHT. YOU GOT YOUR FATHER'S EYES. THOSE MUST BE YOUR MOTHER'S. LISTEN, NUMB... I'D LOVE TO WATCH YOU MUTILATE YOURSELF SOME MORE, BUT... I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. YEAH? AIN'T THAT TOO BAD? I CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON THE CODES, NUMB. YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. MOVE YOUR ASS! YOU GOT 2 MINUTES, PUSSYCAT. MAKE IT COUNT. DO YOU MIND? NOT AT ALL. Travis over radio: HEY, DEV, ONCE YOU'RE IN, HEAD STRAIGHT AND TAKE YOUR FIRST RIGHT. DOC, I'M HERE. NICK? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, NICK? I'M ON A PACKAGE TOUR. WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE? NICK, WE'RE IN TROUBLE. YEAH, I KNOW. WHAT DO THEY WANT? OUR VIRUS. OH, GREAT. NICK, HE KILLED MY FATHER, THAT SON OF A BITCH. WHAT?! WHO? I DON'T KNOW. SOME--SOME WEIRD GUY. HE'S GOT HORRIBLE EYES AND WHITE HAIR. HE LOOKS LIKE A LAB RAT ON STEROIDS. NASSIM. YEAH. HOW DID YOU KNOW? IT DOESN'T MATTER. LISTEN, ALEX, WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT MESS WITH THIS GUY. YOU UNDERSTAND? YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME THAT. I HAVE LESS THAN AN HOUR BEFORE THE VIRUS SELF-DESTRUCTS, AND THEN KENJI-- EVERYBODY DIES, NICK. IF YOU GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS, HE'LL LET YOU LIVE? IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? WHILE MILLIONS ON THE OUTSIDE DON'T. I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, DOC. YOU'RE GONNA BUY IT EITHER WAY. I KNOW HOW THIS GUY OPERATES. THEN YOU HAVE TO STOP HIM. I HAVE TO STOP HIM? I HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU, DOC, BUT I'M A JANITOR. I MOP FLOORS. BEING A HERO WAS NOT IN THE JOB DESCRIPTION. YOU WANT ME TO CHANGE A LIGHTBULB? I'LL CHANGE A LIGHTBULB. FINE. Numb: TIME'S UP, PUSSYCAT. COMING! [TOILET FLUSHES] NICK, WE DON'T NEED A JANITOR. WHAT? DO YOU WANT THE JOB OR NOT? I'LL STALL THEM AS LONG AS I CAN. LET'S GO, PUSSYCAT. ALL RIGHT. [GROAN] THIS IS KILLING MY BACK, MON. I DON'T LIKE THIS PLACE, DEV. WHY WE GOT TO GO CHASE THIS JANITOR, MON? Travis: HE'S ON THE MOVE. [CLUNK] UNHH! ALL RIGHT! JANITOR BOY MUST'VE CAUGHT YOU SLEEPIN' ON THE JOB, EH? GET HIM! Travis: HEY, SAL, HE'S STRAIGHT AHEAD. SAL, YOU SHOULD BE RIGHT ON HIM. HE'S RIGHT THERE. WHAT THE HELL?! AAAH! AIEEEEE! AAAAAAH! AAH! AAH! OHH! AAAAARRGGHHH! UHH! ARGGHH! IS THIS WHY I BROUGHT YOU ALONG, DEV, SO YOU COULD GET YOUR NOSE BROKEN? BY A JANITOR. LISTEN, YOU-- ENOUGH! DEVON, FIND THE JANITOR AND KILL IT. I HAVE ENOUGH DISTRACTIONS. Sportscaster: WELL, HERE IT IS, THE TOP OF THE SIXTH, AND THE NEPTUNES ARE TAKING A POUNDING. SHIT. SUPPOSE IT ISN'T A JANITOR. WHO? I DON'T KNOW. SUPPOSE IT ISN'T. MEGHAN, GO WITH DEVON. HAVE FUN... BUT BE CAREFUL. IT'S GONNA FEEL SO GOOD. YEAH, I KNOW. WE'VE GOT COMPANY, NASSIM. TRAVIS, PATCH ME IN. I WANNA SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. Computer: YOU ARE ENTERING A SECURED PERIMETER. PLEASE IDENTIFY. Nassim: DEACTIVATE IT. PERIMETER DEACTIVATED. HEY, JOHNNY, HOW ABOUT A BREAK, HUH? YEAH, OUR TREAT.

I WANT THIS GUY, JERRY. [BEEP] LINK UP! [ELECTRONIC HUM] AAH! [GRUNTS] OH! [METAL CREAKS] [NICK SCREAMS] READY, MEGHAN. WHAT INTRIGUED ME ABOUT YOUR FATHER'S DISCOVERY WAS HIS BIOLOGICAL COMPONENT... HENCE, THE ASSIMILATOR. MEGHAN WILL DOWNLOAD THE VIRUS INTO A COMPUTER CHIP INSIDE MY BRAIN. AND WHEN YOUR BODY REJECTS IT? RISK IS A STEPCHILD OF ADMISSION, DOCTOR. IF MY SYSTEM REJECTS THE VIRUS, I DIE. BUT IF IT DOESN'T, THE VIRUS AND I BECOME ONE. I WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT AT WILL... DIRECT IT WITH MY THOUGHT WAVES ANYWHERE... AT ANY TIME. [ELECTRONIC PULSE] AAH! Sportscaster: SWING... AND IT'S A MISS. THE COUNT'S 3 AND 2. IT'S ALL RIDING ON THE MEXICAN'S SHOULDERS NOW. AND, HEY, I'LL SAY ONE THING, WIN OR LOSE, YOU COULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER FINISH. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS COMEBACK, BOB? WELL, FRANK, FRANKLY, I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
