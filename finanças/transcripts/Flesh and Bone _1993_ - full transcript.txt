(Radio plays) Clem? Turn down that thing, will ya? You're gonna wake Scotty. What's that? The RCA. Scotty's got school tomorrow. Oh, all right. Say, you haven't seen my glasses, have you? On the table, next to the clock. Yes... you're such a pretty girl. Aren't you? (Baby coos) Yeah. (Dog growls) (ruff) (ruff) (whining) (dog barking) No, they're not here. Try the washroom. (Dog barking) What's gotten into Jack? Anderson's bitch must be in heat again. I'll go run her up the road. Hey, hey, shh. (Dog growls) What is it, Jack? That old bitch doggin' you again? Lulu, is that you out there? You go on home now, you hear? Go on. Git! What the devil... Still dead? I don't understand it. Kiner ran a new wire just last month. You can drive into town in the morning. He looks like he could use a good night's rest, anyway. You get anything more out of him? No. He just keeps saying he's lost. Scotty, what are you doing down here? You don't know this here boy, do you, son? Jack! Hush! I'll put him in the barn. Come on! (Dog barks) No! Come on! (Clem) You get out! Why don't we go upstairs and run you a bath? Didn't your mama think to give you a haircut? Now, what is this? Oh! My God... Who'd do such a thing to a boy? (Music box plays) (clock chimes 3:00) (dog barks) Aah! Clem? (Baby cries) They're supposed to be asleep. You always know they're supposed to be asleep. Hmm? (Baby cries) Somebody else in this house? Hmm? I mean beside that baby? Somebody else in this house? Boy... I'm your father. Now, you answer your father. Is there somebody else... in this house, hmm? (Gunshot) (baby wails) Is this one as smart as the other one? Afraid so. How come they're all named Betty? Well, now... that is a good question. Maybe they're not as smart as we think. Here. Stick with the jukebox. My bird's frying her ass out there in the hot sun, Theodore. Yeah, well, county health's going to fry my ass if I put her back inside. I serve food here, Arlis. So to speak. By the way, some 14-year-old kid bought cigarettes out of your machine, and his parents are threatening to sue me. You want me to take it out? Hell, no. I'm just telling you what I'm up against. Your mangy chickens are the least of my problems. Should've heard the stink over the rubbers. Arlis, do we have to have a goddamn prophylactic machine in the ladies' toilet? We are doing 2-to-1 compared to the men's room. I know, but this ain't Abilene. We're a small town. We got small town values. Am I right, Cindy? Amen. (Screen door closes) Like I said, you just missed him. We were preparing to close the casket. Well, it's probably best. I'm sort of the black sheep of the family. Well, as they say, in death all is forgiven. That's a nice sentiment. I'll have to remember that. Exactly what relation are you? It's complicated. Uh, would you mind giving us a moment alone? Of course. The book is here if you care to sign. Thank you. God bless... whoever you are. My face breaks out about two days after you leave town. Every time, like some goddamn teenage girl. It's the chocolate. Well, I know. Just can't help myself. How come you don't have those little cheese and peanut butter crackers? Pick up pinworms in the heat. Pinworms? Jesus. Too bad. My kids love those things. You want a carton of Kools for Nathan? Oh, no. He's quit. Again. (Clucking) Jesus, I never get used to these chickens. 20, 25? All right, lay it down. You heard about Lou Jameson? I heard his widow is looking to unload his machines. Was. Pudge Riley got to her Friday last. He get the Remingtons? Two dozen electro-slots. Says he's got a buyer for them in Oklahoma. All I know is, Lou Jameson's widow is sitting on all the Texaco stations in Benson county and most of the Dairy Queens, with no machines. I don't want Benson county. Arlis, I had to drive through Benson to get here. Why not expand a little? I'm big enough. I don't need Benson. But, Arlis-- just make a note about the machines, Elliot. O.K. Oh, say, Arlis, I almost forgot. There was a fella asking about you over in, uh... Woodlake. Denny Harris? No, uh, just some fella. Said he knew you from way back. I figure he must have worked for you sometime. Why's that? He had one of our dimes. You know, the blue juke dimes. You get a name? He didn't offer. I didn't ask. Said he wanted to look you up. Anyway, I stayed vague. O.K., Elliot. You did right. I'll see you on the 7th. (Rock music plays) (hooting and whistling) Looks like I'm going to be stretching felt in the morning. You're stretching your luck if you're thinking about takeout. Feels a slight feverish tonight. Just wait till that damn cake pops its lid. Unless that little pastry inside comes with a bicycle pump and two sisters, there ain't going to be a farm animal safe for three counties tonight. * Broke A thousand hearts * * Before I met you * I'll break A thousand more, baby * * Before I am through * * I wanna be yours, Pretty baby * * Yours and yours alone * I'm gonna Tell ya, honey * * That I'm Bad to the bone * * Bad to the bone... (click) (speaking Spanish) * I wanna tell ya, Pretty baby * * What I see, I make my own * * And then I'm Gonna tell ya, honey * * That I'm Bad to the bone * * Bad to the bone * B-b-b-b-bad... * Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! 3... 2...1! (Cheering) Christ almighty. Let's put her in my pickup. Where can I take you, honey? Feel like knocking a few sins off your ledger, Arlis? You want me to find out if she's got a home. And take her there. What's the damage? Well, put it this way. Feed this girl a cucumber, it'd come out pickles. (Thunder) (clucking) Jesus. (Door opens) I figure the bed's one of those vibrating numbers, so that explains the quarters. Nobody could possibly fancy pretzel twists that much, so I figured you won some kind of weird contest. As for the condoms... well... either you got a yen for cheerleading squads, or we had the night of all nights. Whatever, there's an explanation. As for the blue chicken, I need a little help with that one. You passed out. Who wouldn't? The coins just need to be papered for the bank, condoms and twists are inventory, and the chicken's brainy Betty. I take it, Betty's one of the exotics? She plays tic-tac-toe. What makes her so brainy? She wins 9 times out of 10. You want some coffee? You got a machine for that, too? Half a dozen in the next three counties, but given the circumstances of your immediate past, I would suggest the real bean. Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a pair of chinos and a belt, would you? "Boo boo"? The story of my life. (Snap) (honk honk) Wait. Don't forget Lorraine. Peaks beauty academy, right outside red grove near green jeans pickle factory. Buy a burger anywhere around here, chances are it's green jeans under the bun. Anyway... seeing as the beauty academy was right next door to the pickle factory, we always had plenty of people to practice on. So one day I'm doing this tease job on this lady, and my instructor comes over... your collar picked up a little perfume, so if you got a suspicious wife, I'd run some soap through it. No need to worry about that. Heading home? I don't think so. I got a girlfriend up in Bayview. That ought to be enough for now. You got a coat? Yeah. Money? Sure. Well... thanks for the eggs. Everything. Thanks for the company. It must get lonely on the road sometimes. No. Like anything else, you're born to it. Well, you're a born listener, that's for sure. It depends on who's talking. Hey. What's your name? Kay. All right, Kay. You girls watch yourselves. You're sure this is no trouble? No use you waiting seven hours on a bus when I can get you there in two. I just hate taking you off the beaten path. There's a man I can see if you don't mind a detour or two. No. It's greased. Huh? The wristband. By the way, I get those novelties straight from Korea. I can do you 10 on the dollar, as many as you want. Bayview's a little south for you, ain't it, Arlis? Who said anything about Bayview? '55, '56, somewhere in there. Eisenhower days. '57. Whatever. How did you know about Bayview? Reese Davies. Who's Reese Davies? A moron. Used to own a movie theater down that way. At least his father did till he died. Reese ran it into the ground in about 18 months. I had a couple of cigarette machines in the lobby from his old man's day. Then when the theater went south, Reese tried to claim them as assets. It's his wife. Reese's. (Buzz) Ugly as sin, ain't it? Maybe some music will take the bite out of it. (Radio static) Keep going. Sometimes you can pick up Kane when you're driving south. Or here. Big lake's got a station plays George Jones. * Never meant Much to you... * You like George Jones? You spend much time out this way? Who, me? No. Like I said, my... girlfriend... * Why did I fall... There's no girlfriend. It's just me. See... if I hadn't gotten my money stolen, I wouldn't have been jumping out of that cake, and we never would've met, and you wouldn't be driving me back to Bayview. I'm sorry I lied. That's all right. It's just... I'm really not myself right now. That's all right. And I'm married. That's all right, too. * I know I should care * But, sweetheart, It don't seem fair... ** You're with America's number one shopping home television service, bringing you 24 hours of savings, fun, and excitement every day. Jesus. Will you look at this? Two days. Think if I'd been gone a week. If you're just joining us, you're not too late. Uh, don't worry. We're alone. It's always on. Reese goes through a picture tube every six months. I make it a rule not to trespass, especially in a man's house I don't know. Well, believe me, it's more my house than it is his. Drop that anywhere. I'll be right back. You're welcome to a beer if you can find one. I ought to be pushing off. What's that? I said I left my smokes in the truck. What the hell? Afternoon, Mr. Davies. I'm earl Logan, Ned foster's man. Uh... is--is that your truck? Well, yeah--I mean-- well, I was wondering if you could move it. It would make our job a lot easier. And I need you to sign before we can start. Better watch your finger. Son of a bitch. Son of a... bitch! Um... they're... Hello, Hubie? This is Kay Davies. Does my husband happen to be there? Don't lie to me, Hubie! Hubie! Shit! The... what the hell is that in the driveway? I think that they're looking for your husband. Well, they're not the only ones. Can I help you? Uh... ma'am, I need the gentleman's signature so we can begin. You're not taking my furniture. Ma'am, I'm not emotionally involved. Well, I am! Christ! Boo boo? Since it looks like I'm not needed here anymore-- hey, Darlene. You haven't by any chance seen Reese, have you? You have. Uh-huh. Really? Uh-huh. Who are you? Oh, never mind, Darlene. Here he is. Sorry to bother you. This don't look like a good time for introductions, so-- where did you put that duffel? Huh? There. I understand all about schedules. Just let me get my ducks in line. Kay! Quack quack. Jesus, Kay, where in the hell you been? Just what in the hell are you wearing, and just who in the hell is this? You're asking me questions? Exactly what the hell is that truck doing outside? If you'd been here, I wouldn't have to explain it. I'm gone two days, and you sell the furniture? If it makes you feel better, I sold it two weeks ago. Well, shit, Reese, that makes me feel a whole lot better. I don't want to talk about no goddamn chest of drawers. I want to know who this man is. I'm just... none of your fucking business. Well, hell, no. He's in my house with my woman. Are you cheating with my wife, slick? Actually, I-- that's right, Reese. Not two hours ago, we were sweating over each other in the back room of the shady 8 motel. He don't mind it in the morning, and guess what, Reese? I haven't showered. Or brushed my teeth. Actually, I just gave her a ride. In the truck? Now, you listen to me, darling. There are two men on our front lawn, and they got a job to do. Now you're going to let them do it. Ain't that right? Fuck you. Go for it, slick. You got yourself a real lionheart, Kay. Fuck my pretty wife now. (Click) Fuck this. That's my gun. Very good, Reese. It's your gun in my hand, pointed at you. Get the picture? Christ, Kay, you don't even know how to use that thing. I got a pretty good idea. Now, Reese... darling... I suggest you take your sorry ass outside and tell the gentlemen that the deal is off. I can't do that. (Gunshot) Christ, Kay! The clock ain't the only thing running out of time. I took money. I shook hands, Kay. The deal is done. How much? $700. Where is it? There's bills to pay! Shit, Reese, you haven't paid a bill in three years! Where is it? Kay, I just told you. For God's sake, Kay. All right, it's gone. I lost it. Poker? Mostly. You sell that, too? Piano? Hell, no. I bought you that for your birthday, Kay. All right, then, we'll take it. Take it? You got room in the truck, Arlen? Wait just a second here! It's Arlis. Hmm? You don't even know his name? What in the hell has happened to you? Excuse me. Who's holding the gun here? You are. So I guess I can call anybody any damn thing I damn well please, am I right? That's right. Sorry. Back there... your name... mixing it up. That's a horrible thing to do to a person. You were close enough. I have a habit of doing that when I get nervous. I screamed at my boss once for three minutes before I realized I was calling him Leroy, and his name was Ed. Not even close. Sort of took the sting out of it. Scary sometimes. What's that? Moments-- little split seconds of time where you find yourself capable of things you would never even think of doing normally. Like back there holding that gun. There was a moment when my finger twitched... not so you could see. More like inside, under the skin. Some crazy little muscle. And I could've done it. I could've shot him right in the face. My whole life would've changed in one tiny little second. It's not in your blood. Ain't that a kick? Yeah. It's a real tickler. You mind telling me what you got in here? Seven years of bad luck. At least what's left. Well, thank God the furniture's spoken for. Believe me, sooner or later, he'd have slapped a price tag on my ass. To hell with him. He's just taillights to me now. Not that he didn't leave a few dents behind. Let me see. You take a hell of a punch. Practice makes perfect. We'll get you some ice. Arlis, you're telling me this now? I been setting here all afternoon. I been waiting three hours for your call. Rosie, I told you. Something's come up. Something's come up, huh? I know what's come up. You got another woman with you, don't you? Rosie, listen to me. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to a bar and pick up the first man I see. I don't think that's such a good idea. Are you still there, or did you hang up on me? Arlis? Huh? No, I'm still here. You're sort of an odd fellow. You know that? You don't ask many questions... personal, I mean. I figure people share what they want to. No sense crowding them. Women must love you! Put that on your face once you're out. Hey. You mind grabbing me another one of these? Ever been married? Nope. Ever been in love? Oh. Am I crowding you? No. I never been in love. Me, either. What about your husband? Hell, no. I mean, you saw his hair, right? Besides, he's no different than any of the others. I was 13 when the first one pulled my blue jeans off, and ever since they seem to pass me off, one to another, my whole life. They're all members of the same club or something. You know, you look good... without that hat. But you're going to bald. See how high your peaks are? That's from wearing the hat all day. You have to let your scalp breathe. You shouldn't hide your head. You got a nice shape. I'll keep that in mind. It's not 'cause of that, is it? Tattoo? Bet that was one crazy night. No more than any other. Well, whatever. Nothing to feel shy about. You hardly notice it's there. (Baby crying) (dog barks) Come on. Let's go for a little walk, O.K.? Why can't you sleep? Night air usually calms her. (Toilet flushing) This stuff is awful. You sure you asked for cover girl? Yes, I asked, but they were out. Well, my skin does not take to this. How I could forget my beauty bag, I do not know. Probably wouldn't fit in the suitcase. Hey, how do you abide this seat? 10 more miles, my ass will be flat as a pancake. Seats take breaking in. O.K., all right. I get the message. I'm not usually like this. If we'd met under normal circumstances, you'd probably like me. Most people do... or, I mean, I guess they do. I didn't say I didn't like you. Hell, I like you. It's just that there's been a whole lot of... activity in the past couple of days. I go from one town to the next. Do you understand? I see the same faces, hear the same talk, sleep in the same beds, eat the same food. Then I start all over again. I like it that way. I don't like walking into people's houses I don't know. I don't like guns coming out of nowhere. I don't like looking over my shoulder for angry husbands. I don't like surprises-- period. You really like me? What's not to like? Arlis, that stew of yours has got nothing but potatoes and carrots. I don't make it. I just stock it. Homer and I are the only ones who buy it. We get up to our elbows in jauned air, we got no choice. I can go back to the chili if you want. Shit, no. We work close enough in that pit as it is. All I need is homer's ass in my face after two cans of that. Now, I can stand a little of that. She'd steal you blind. So old Sam found you, did she? Came right up. Yeah. She knows the truck. Here. Introduce yourself. You like that, don't you? Better than that scratch old Charlie feeds you. She'll follow you all day now. What happened to her throat? She ran herself through a fence couple of years back. Tore herself up pretty good. Hey, girl. But you're still here, ain't you, darling? Do you ride? Oh, once or twice-- county fairs, stuff like that. You? Once or twice. Hyah! Hyah! I bet you can't swim, neither. That? Beginner's luck. Well... there was a cowboy who showed me a thing or two. Hmm. Coming in? Nah. I'm fine. Suit yourself. So, who showed you about horses? When I was about 12, 13, I worked a little horse farm like this. Shoveled stalls during the day, got a roof over my head at night. Well... where was your mother? She died. Oh. How about your father? Long story. He still alive? You ask all your cowboys this many questions? Why don't you come on in here and cool off? We got to go. I don't want to go. Storm's coming. There's no storm. I can feel it. (Changing radio stations) How come some of them are blue-- those dimes? They're juke dimes. Juke dimes? What's that? I give the boss man a roll of these, he'll start up a jukebox. You play your own jukebox. That don't make sense. People don't make sense. * Hard to say... Man walks into the place with a jukebox, right? 9 times out of 10, if that box isn't already playing, he'll be shy about starting it or won't even know it's there. You get it going for him, 9 times out of 10, he'll keep it going... with his own money. Trick of the trade. * Can love Not fade away... * How come you paint them blue? Just keeps them separate from the boss man's money. That's all. You go east... Billy Breckens paints his green. Drop down two counties... buddy Clark-- he--his are red. Me--I'm just partial to blue. * You see, I was afraid... * You could use a trim. * Led my baby astray... I got a man in Blackwell does me every third Wednesday. I could do you. * And then One sad day... ** Couple of snips here... couple there. I think your hands are a couple of beers past steady. I'd do you better blind than you been getting. Your man in Blackwell doesn't understand your head. Besides, I'm not drunk. I know exactly what I'm doing. * Blue moon * You saw me Standing alone * * Without a dream In my heart * * Without a love Of my own ** Looks like you were right... about that storm. (Thunder) What? Nothing. (Thunder) (knock on door) What? Did you say something? Is somebody out there? (Knock knock) Shit. Maybe it's Reese come. (Knock knock) Jesus. Oh, thank God. I'm sorry to bother you, but the night man's gone to bed, and I'm having some trouble with my car. You try the bell? The bell? For the night man. Sure. But no one came, and no one along here would open their door to me. You're the only one. What's wrong with your car? Aw, hell if I know. I am lost when it comes to anything mechanical. But, um, you look like you might know something about motors. Am I right? (Thunder) You got the keys? Inside. You got it in gear. What? You got it in gear. Well, damn. You'd follow a mouse into the mouth of a snake, wouldn't you, junior? He's hurt bad. Hurt bad. Honey, I cut my lip worse than this and went on whistling. See, it's just that, uh... hell, I can't fix it myself, and my sweet pea there, she don't know how. How long it's been, boy? Hmm? Well. Long time... no see. Yeah. Ugly little bastards, ain't they? How's it look? I seen worse. Yeah, I guess my whole life's back there. Good portion of yours, too, huh, son? Be glad it's just birdseed chasing you this time. Yeah. Nothing like that night in Kilgore, huh? Here come winter. It get cold enough. The pinching gets something fierce. Sometimes you can't get it all out. Sometimes you got to carry it with you. Don't get me wrong. You was always a good boy. You always did what you was told. (Door opens) Well, most of the time. I managed to raise the night man. Shit. Shouldn't we get a doctor? Little darling, I don't believe there's a pill peddler alive got a better touch than my boy here. And best of all, he don't ask no questions. Practice makes perfect. Hey, you got an injured man here, boy. Easy. Aah! That's nice. That's nice, that smell. You got the smell of love on you, boy. Tell me. Tell me. Hey, does she taste as good? Heh heh. Hey, come here, boy. Come on, get your father's boots off. It's the least a son can do... till he's ready to wear 'em hisself. Get yourself out of those clothes before you catch a chill. Don't worry yourself. I never caught anything in my life. Everybody catches something. Not me. Well, I broke a finger once, but... I don't figure that counts. Shit. This is too fucking weird. I wish I could say the same. I'm always catching a cold. I had one just last month. I'm sorry to hear it. Come on, you can't sleep in those. Find something of mine. I'll hang yours up to dry. Come on. What's your name? Ginnie. With a "j" or a "g"? You planning on writing me a letter? All right, keep it a mystery. It's a nice name either way. Yeah. Well, I'm not a nice girl. But... I'll bet that you are, aren't you? I like to think so. And the guy who did that to your face, did he think you were nice? Not at the time. Hmm. But you stay with him anyway, don't you? Who, Arlis? He didn't do this to me. He's not like that. Don't kid yourself. Eventually, they're all like that... evil. But, once you know that, you can turn it back against them. Use it. Arlis doesn't have an evil bone in his body. But... What? I don't know. I just... I get the feeling he's been close to it, felt the heat of it. I think that you're the one that's felt the heat of it... and not too long ago at that. There's a pretty cotton nightshirt in there with tulips on it. I know you'll love that. You don't exactly travel light, do you? Long story. Take anything you want. Ohh! Well, how about this? That was my mother's. I'm sorry. This her? She's pretty. Yeah, I guess she was. (Coughing) Fuck. You looking for something? Three guesses. I had some serious shit in that car. Your shit's still in it. You mind telling me where? Across the tracks over there in mesquite. You mind telling me why? Anybody see you last night? Last night? Oh, no. You sure? Yeah. You sure? Are you deaf? Yeah, I'm sure. Then who's pepper was I picking out of my father's shoulder? Some half-wit pump owner stumbled onto us in the rain, took a wild shot, and hit something. Nobody saw the car. I guess I wasted my time. I guess you did. I'm his kin, you understand? I got no choice. So don't think this is some game you're playing. It could've just as easy been you bleeding in the rain. Only difference is, he'd have left you behind... or finished the job himself. Well, shit. No wonder old black eyes loves you. You wouldn't have the balls to shoo a fly off a steak. Warm you boys up? Is that one at a time or both together? You're a little devil, aren't you? I'll damn sure put the curl in your hair, you give me the chance. I don't need a man for that. There you go. Thank you, ma'am. Where you from? Why do you want to know that? Who give her that mask? Does it matter? I suppose you're right. People get what they deserve. What do you want? Hmm? If it's money, I-- Money? Money? Here, boy. I don't need your money. Well, why are you here? I got shot, and you fixed me up. I'm having some eggs. Does that seem strange? Just like old times, huh? Just coincidence. I had a loose end to take care of up north, Oklahoma way, around Ardmore, them parts, and, uh... an associate of mine, uh... got a little greedy. Started threatening... well, it started to weigh on me and... stole my sleep. And you know how I feel about loose ends. Been one myself. That's true, isn't it, junior? He bought me lunch, and he bought me a pack of cigarettes. After Oklahoma, I was working in Austin. Drifted on down, run into this little girl over here. And, uh, I saw her switching tickets in this diner in cherry spring. She had her a full rancher's breakfast, then she pulled a switch with this little old lady had coffee and pie. A little low-rent for you, ain't it? Well, it was the way she did it, see? Smooth as glass. Real nerve. Well, at least she won't go hungry. Well, she's a little bigger than that. The last couple of months, she's been running this slick little game, thing of beauty. She steals from the dead. She's been sloppy about it, of course. Would have got caught I hadn't come along. But she's got grit in spades. I'll have to watch my back with this one. Her heart beats about twice a minute. Least it beats. I don't want you to kid yourself, junior. See, you and me... we're flesh and bone. The same blood that runs in my veins... runs yours. You seen my duffel? May be in the truck. What happened last night with your father? He just has the habit of putting himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. What's all that? She hardly has a thing to wear from what I gather. Lord knows, I got enough. Besides, most of these are full of bad memories. Not too many spring picnics here. This may not be none of my business, but, uh, see, I run into that little scarecrow you got running that north territory up there. Uh, he mention that? He mentioned it. Good. Uh, his name, uh, Eddy--Elroy-- Elliot. Elliot. Right. Elliot. He's a nervous little son of bitch, isn't he? Got a real strange way of walking, them ankles so close together. I notice things like that. You notice that? What's your point? Well... it, uh, might not be my place. It looked to me like he's stealing from you, son. Elliot's an honest man. You sure know him better than I do. It's just that, see, uh, I watched him at this filling station outside of paint rock this one afternoon. He had him two sacks, and he was running quarters in both of them. It don't take no real genius to count Clark bars and figure out that you're short. He has been short on you, junior. Short don't mean he's stealing. No. No, I guess not. But then again, what else would it mean, huh? Bye, y'all. You sure you're fit to travel? Aw, hell, this ain't nothing, darling. Heck, I'm what you call a, what, a quick healer. You ask Arlis there. I'd wreck my shoulder on a Sunday and still give him a spanking on Monday. There's a Texaco station about 10 miles east. Might be your last chance for a while. Well, I appreciate that. Truly, I--except we're heading north around Benson county. You remember Benson county, don't you, junior? Ah, I'm just needling him. The boy always hated it up there. Them locusts drove him crazy. You take care now. Get yourself packed. We're leaving. Funny, I'd never put it together, him and you. If I'd met you separate, I'd never see the tie. I guess we don't get much choice in it, do we? No. What was all that talk about Benson county? Just talk. I don't remember the locusts at all. Pass me that bottle again, will you? We finished the last we had. We or you? (Sighs) What's the difference? It's gone. Next place you see, you stop. You're the boss. (Singing softly) That's strange. What? Look at that house up there. It looks familiar. Sure. That's the one in the photograph. Photograph? Uh-huh. The one that lady had. I saw it in her suitcase when I went looking for a nightshirt. You're wrong. No. That roof was just the same, and the trees, and the windmill with that-- there's thousands of houses look just like that up here. No, I'm positive. No one has lived in that house for years. Oh. Well, looks like it was a nice place once. I think whoever lived there would've kept it up. Not that house. What do you mean? Years ago, they say some Mexican shot the man that, uh, he was working for. Then, uh, ahem, shot the whole family right--right after. Jesus. I mean, that's the story I heard. It changes over the years, you know. Who knows what the truth is anymore? But no matter the story, it all comes back to one thing. What's that? That house, uh... they say it's haunted. But then, I don't believe in ghosts. All right, Darlene. Thanks. No! No, I'm glad you told me. Yeah, you, too. Bye. I can't believe it. He filed for divorce, Reese did. Uh... ahem. I'm sorry. Sorry? I'm just amazed he could do the paperwork by himself. I want to celebrate. Celebrate? Yeah. I feel free-- for the first time in my life, I think. I want to put on a pretty dress, get you out of that hat, and go have a nice, big, fat steak. Any suggestions? Try C-17. C-17. How come this place is closed middle of the week? Pete's boy plays baseball for a local school. Anytime tommy's set to pitch, Pete throws a lock on the place, and he rides the bus with the team. That's how come I got the key. He must trust you. I guess he does. (Stardust plays) (Willie Nelson) * Sometimes I... You play this for all the girls, old C-17? First time. You an honest man, Arlis Sweeney? * Dreamin' of a song Yes, ma'am. * The melody... You like the dress? I like the dress. * ...Once again with you You like the girl? * When our love Was new... * I'd say she's the prettiest woman in the room. * Kiss an inspiration * Pretty enough to dance with? * But that was Long ago * Well... (gasps) Now don't tell me you don't. * Stardust of a song Hmm. Well, don't you think it's about time you learned? Dancing... frees the soul. * You are in my arms * A nightingale * Tells his fairy tale * A paradise Where roses bloom * * And though I Dream in vain * * In my heart * There always Will remain * * My stardust melody * The memory Of love's refrain * (baby crying) Howdy, partner. Hey. Hey? That's all I get after last night--hey? Morning. Good morning, darling. Why don't you shake on into the kitchen and crack me a beer? Need some help? Yeah. Get me two cases of milky ways by 9 a.m. 'cause that's what my hired man's going to be looking to take to Crockett county. I haven't even got one case. Hell, I ain't got a milky way--period. I'm sure the good people of Crockett county can do without a milky way a day or two. It's my job, all right? Ooh! We're a little surly in the morning, aren't we? That's ok. It runs in my family, too. What's that? Morning bear-- I said it runs in my family, too. What else runs in your family? Huh? Your family--you never talk about them. Well, believe me, there's a lot more interesting things to talk about than my family. I already told you everything that's worth telling anyway. Besides, I haven't seen them in years. Not since I got married. But when you were a kid growing up, what were they like? What'd your mother do? What'd your father do? If I didn't know you better, Arlis Sweeney, I'd say you were crowding me. Maybe you don't know me. What'd my father do? Drink, mostly. Gamble. Lost everything we had eventually. That's how I met Reese. Went to go collect my father one night at this place out in the woods where there was always an all-night game, and there they were, sitting shoulder to shoulder-- two drunks... losing money faster than one sober fool ever could. Of course, I was a real fool. Ended up taking Reese home, stayed to make his breakfast, never left. Why the sudden interest? Nothing. I just, uh... happened to see that photograph in your suitcase. Oh, well, that's not me. It is me, but it isn't. It's, uh... see, my parents, the only parents I've ever known, are really, uh, my aunt and uncle by blood. The people in the photograph I never knew. They were lost when I was a baby-- killed. Car accident. Car accident? Yeah. When I was old enough, I was given the picture and told about it. I don't know why I hang onto it. It's just, um... you grow up in an ugly house, the way I did, sometimes you wonder how it might've been... if things hadn't happened the way they did. It's funny. Your father, the other day, mentioned Benson county. That's where they lived, I'm pretty sure... the people in the picture... my family. Ok. I'm about ready. Listen. I think maybe it would be better you stay here. Stay here? While I run up the road, tend to Elliot. Ok. There's some money over there. Get yourself something to eat while I-- while I'm gone. Well, they must make one hell of a Spanish omelet. All right. I'll wait for you. Hey. You don't want to be going anywhere without this. Earl's truck stop over at coke county run out of Cheez-Its again. Cheez-Its and truckers, they sure go together. Oh, Phil Pritchard wants you to ring him up about putting another coke machine in his ice rink. I can't figure why he waited so long. Two years I've been telling him. You're a little light here, Elliot. Yeah, well, I had trouble with the Mexicans again. They hurt the machines? Nothing I couldn't put right with a crowbar. I had to replace the brace on one. Slung it with a 3/4-inch. That should solve your problem. Should, but these boys are strong. Hell knows I couldn't pop her. Without the key. Yeah. Well, that's what I meant. Without the key. You look like you had one too many cups of coffee, Elliot. It's the chill, I guess. Are you stealing from me? Arlis, you know I did time in big spring. I told you that right off day we met. But I did the time. I'm out now. And I want to stay that way. I'm not sure that answers my question. Arlis, you don't know... 'cause you never been in trouble. But once you've been in trouble and people know it, you feel guilty for things you never done just because you know they think you got it in you. That potential. That why your hands are shaking? That's why my hands are shaking. I like my job, Arlis. I like you. I like you, too, Elliot. I'll see you next week. And, Elliot, that business about the machines-- it ain't the Mexicans. Up here, they blame everything on the Mexicans. We asked 100 women this question. Give me the most popular answer that 100 women answered. Tell me a reason why women leave their husbands. Ken? Infidelity. Did our women say infidelity? It's number one! (Applause) Who needs him anyway? (Knock on door) (train whistle blows) (ring) (ring) Stardust motel. Emma, it's Arlis. Ring 12 for me, will you? Not unless you want to talk to Teresa. She's pulling the sheets right now. What do you want me to do with the suitcase? Suitcase? I'll have jimmy put it in maintenance. Well, I don't follow you. Where's the lady? Gone. Been gone about an hour now. They just got in the car and left. They? Who's they? She and her friend-- a young lady in sunglasses. A real stinger, that one. Asked me for directions 3 times, then took half the guest mints from the bowl. I swear, some people have no manners. They say where they were going? Up north, I guess. The young one had gotten turned around, wanted to know how to get on the farm route. They could be anywhere in the county. Suits you, the dress. You can have it back, if that's what you mean. I'm just saying it suits you, that's all. You might think about doing something with your hair. You got a nice face. You should let the boys see it. It ain't my face the boys want to see. Maybe you haven't met the right boy. And you have? I thought so. Last night, at least. But now I-- I don't know what to think. Look, you can't figure men, so don't run yourself ragged trying. I don't know why he didn't call me. I told you. It's a surprise. I don't even know what's going on myself. I'm just doing what I was told. Well, here we are. This where we're going? I--I don't-- Oh, my God. Surprise. (Roy) Howdy. Hey. Now she's some old dame, ain't she? Look at that face, sweet pea. Does that break your heart? To pieces. First time you seen it. How did he know? What's that, ma'am? The house, how-- how did he know where it was? Oh, Arlis, he, uh-- he knows a lot more than he lets on. Anyway, sweet pea saw it, and, uh... something about a photograph. That about right? Right. Where is he? Oh, he'll be along. Say, you want to take a little look inside, look around? Well, go on. But you be careful, now. Watch yourself, especially on them stairs there. There's more termites than there is timber by now. How was the movie? I got here as fast as I could. You talk to that clerk there at the motel? Mm-hmm. And dropped enough crumbs for a flock of geese. That's 10 minutes. Where the hell you been? She had to pee... twice. And I had to make a stop of my own. I know how grim you get you don't get your breakfast. You're smarter than I thought. I'm not smart enough to figure out what we're doing wasting our time out here in crackerland. I'm going to tell you all about loose ends someday, and you'll want to listen careful. You look like you seen a ghost here, junior. I hope he brought some food. Arlis? You all right? Aw, hell, he's fine, just fine. Cat's got his tongue is all. Come on up. There's something I want to show you. Watch your step, son. It's like heaven, isn't it? My mother must have stood right here, brushing her hair... daydreaming... I think I figured it out. I must have slept in here... or there. No. In front. In those days, houses like these, they'd put the baby in the front of the house. That way if a woman was hanging laundry and the baby cried, she could hear. Maybe my mother hung laundry out back. Sun's strongest in the front. You seem to know more about me than I do, so you tell me-- were my parents good people? Were they nice to baby Kay? I'm sure they were. What makes you so sure? (Roy) 'Cause you're good people. And good people come from good people. Isn't that right, son? That's right. Well, I'm not so sure that's true. But it's nice of you to say. Oh, no. I'm-- I'm not just saying it. I know it. That's a fact. I want to go outside. That's a good idea. Would you do me a favor? Would you take Ginnie while you're at it? She's probably biting on her nails by now. I'll go with you. Nah. Uh, I need to talk to you-- father to son, you know. Let the girls get some wind in their hair. We could walk for days, I'll bet, and never see anything but this. Wouldn't that be a thrill? See, it was the girl-- sweet pea-- that first mentioned it-- the house being the same and all. I thought she had it all wrong, naturally. See, I knew-- I knew I'd never seen this woman of yours before 'cause, hell, I never forget a face, never. But... still, there was something dogging me-- a sound. Halfway to Shreveport, I see a lady standing by the side of the road. Her mother. That's when I knew what it was. That sound in my head. Her crying. See, I had-- I'd forgotten... about the baby. What's that sound? Hear it? (Buzzing) Bugs. No. She doesn't know. There's no reason for her to know, no reason for me to tell her. I--I realize that. I truly--truly do. But this woman, she's different. See, I... I noticed that the first time I seen her-- the way she looked at you, and the way you looked at her. Hell, it was touching, truly. She'll never know. I swear it on my life. Damn, I--I wish I could believe that. But as much as we are the same, you've always been a little too emotional. I left her this morning. I only came back 'cause of you... this little game. Oh, this ain't no game, junior. You know me better than that. I must be out of my fucking mind. It's not gonna change, you know! They don't grow this stuff but one color. It's a shame, really. So sweet, almost innocent. She is innocent. But I'm not. Take me. And she can't know. I couldn't do that. What kind of man would that make me? A man shoot his own kin? No. I couldn't sleep with that. And I do prize my sleep. There's really only one question here, son-- do I do it... or you? (Neigh) I could hear 'em. You don't mind if I smoke, do you? You know how I always enjoy a good cigar. See, that's what separates me from other men-- that I can tell the difference. Good cigar's not what separates you from other men. What separates you, junior? You fuck their wives? I don't shoot their children. You done what you were told, there wouldn't have been any blood that night. I didn't pull the trigger. No, but you opened the door. They were supposed to be asleep. They're always supposed to be. Besides, wasn't me that shot first. I had no choice. And the boy? Did he have a choice? Fuck that little boy! He almost got your daddy killed. We had one bad night. That was 30 years ago. There was more than one bad night. But that was your night, wasn't it, junior? You're right. You didn't pull the trigger. You did open the door, and now... you brung her to me. See... you're stupid. You always been stupid. You was stupid when you were a little kid. As a man, shit, you're being stupid now. Who's got the gun, boy? Huh? Me? Of course not. Put it on me and pull the trigger. Come on. Come on. Hmm? See? You can't. You can't. Just can't. You can't... 'cause we're kin. Blood. Look, you go ahead and run along and fill up them candy machines. Yeah, it's only right that I do it. This way we both can sleep easier. Dad. Son? Sweet dreams. (Gunshot) What happened? Get in the truck. But-- get in the truck! Hey. Everything he told you... it's a lie. Thanks for the advice. Don't be in a hurry to leave. They know me here for years, so you just stay as long as you want till you figure out your next step. You got your key? Yeah. I got my key. What was I doing in that house today? Or am I crowding you? There are some things that... are better left unsaid. Just does no good to talk about 'em. No good at all. It's like I said-- I'm a creature of habit. Each town I go, there's a place to eat, place to sleep. And in each town, there's also a woman. I'm starting to miss them. Sure. I understand. I just sort of fell into your life, anyway. There wasn't any reason to it. God knows I've been a burden. It's just... I really haven't been myself these last few days. Yes, you have. You've been fine. Better than fine. Looks like they're almost gone. Them bruises. I better go. I got a jukebox up the road that's only playing George Jones. That ain't so bad. I guess not. Hey, I stumble on any of those blue dimes of yours, maybe I'll use a couple of them, give you a call, let you know how I'm doing. You know where to find me. What's that on your pocket? That's nothing. That's just a little blood.
