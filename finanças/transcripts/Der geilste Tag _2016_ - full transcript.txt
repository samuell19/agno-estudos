In the end, it's quite simple. There's almost no wind at all. The sun isn't intense but my sunburn stings. I have salt in my hair and I can taste tuna and orange juice. Across from me sits Benno. It seems We've known each other forever. 17 days, to be exact. Benno is strange. We don't even really like each other. Benno is my best friend. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE Get out of here! Hey, wait! Carmen Nebel deserves better! THE MOST BEAUTIFUL DAY Is this a good start? - Why didn't you come earlier? - No, not a good start. It's not your first fainting spell. How long has it been going on? As long as I can remember. Have you seen a doctor? I was told it was hormones. - That it'd sort itself out. - GPs! I felt fine. - Yes, but now it has spread. - What? This, behind your palate. It probably caused the fainting. But that's just a hunch on my part. But you're full of it, from head to toe. And what does that mean? Do you want the public or the private answer? I don't know. What's the difference? The length of the treatment. The end result is the same. And how are my chances? Shitty. It's a miracle you're still here. - Beate, do you want one too? - Oh, yes! Should we call anyone? Are you able to...? Hello out there! This is Blog Entry 453. Hello out there! This is Blog Entry 453. Today I have a slight tug in my left arm. The tips of my index and middle finger are tingling. Correction. My middle finger and ring finger tingle. Morphine dose upped to 3O mg. 32, next door, died yesterday. A new guy has moved in. But word is it won't be long. Oh, this is funny. The hospital clown cancelled. The new guy faints when he laughs or feels any type of strong emotion. The new guy faints when he laughs or feels any type of strong emotion. His cancer has a sense of humour. - Breakfast. - Hello! Cat! The cat! Have to be careful, due to the new resident next door. - How terrible! So young! - And what about me? Let's open the window a crack, huh? - I'll need my scarf. - Scarf, of course. MY Pager? - Huh? - Where's my pager? What if they page me? What if the battery is empty? Relax, we'll have a look. It can't have just vanished. - Do you have it? - Huh? What? Ah, Mr Benno! Have you woken up? That's nice. It was all a bit much, wasn't it? Now just relax. I'll be with you in no time at all. And, as you've seen, here are nice, comfy, freshly washed clothes. And, as you've seen, here are nice, comfy, freshly washed clothes. Welcome! What was that? Breakfast this morning. Get Dr WiJst! This was the last one. Bugger! Ms Patonga, might you have some Sellotape for Mr Reiter? I need to prepare for the transplant when the lung comes. - You said that yourself. - That was three years ago. You said that it could come at any time. It's spring. Motorcyclists ride in the mountains. To find the right lung for you there'd need to be a major pile-up involving hundreds of non-smoking marathoners. Just a little rear-end collision. I think you can give me the pager back. No. You do know where you are? Oh shit! 453, addendum. Well, it appears my time has come. It's cold as hell. So much for spring. I hate Germany. That's it. I'll jump now. I'm going to finish... Shit! That same thing happened to me too. - You didn't say anything? - You didn't seem to want to go back. I'll leave you be then, okay? Why doesn't it have a handle? That can't be code compliant! Why doesn't it have a handle? That can't be code compliant! - Take care! - Wait! Wait a minute! - How do we get back in? -''We''? I'm cold. Write an e-mail. Maybe they'll come get you. I'm blogging. About life with pulmonary fibrosis. - With what? - Pulmonary fibrosis. - My lung is turning to scar tissue. - Sounds like a real blockbuster. - My lung is turning to scar tissue. - Sounds like a real blockbuster. There are some very successful cancer blogs! Shit! Excuse me. Could I maybe have your blanket? Thanks. No one gives a crap about it. - What? - My blog. I have 12 followers. Four are my doctors and three are dead. But Facebook doesn't know that yet. It makes no difference if I'm here or if I'm gone. I won't leave anything behind. What is it you'd like to leave behind? - Do you know what this is? - What is it? It's from Mozart. -It's a speck. -It's a minim rest. My father always said if I left half as much behind as this man in an instant of silence, then it was worth it. And? Has it been worth it? What does it look like, you dickhead?! Lang Lang plays on Carmen Nebel, I'm here with a rotting lung. I practised like mad for nothing at all. My whole life is a bloody minim rest! I practised like mad for nothing at all. My whole life is a bloody minim rest! I'll never sit down at a damn piano... Hey, hey, hey! Everything all right? Hey! Does it hurt? What? Here, your... The... No. I don't feel a thing. Aren't you scared? I'm not your self-help group. -It's bad to bottle up grief. - I'll get started then. - With what? - Your dad's an arsehole. - He's dead. - But you're not yet. Oh god... Hello? I'll leave the balcony door open, okay? Great guy... Good morning! Come on, wake up! We're still alive! Family members are complaining. What is all this stuff here? - People order loads of stuff. - In the hospice? Yeah, for kicks. They never have to pay for it anyway. - Good morning. - Huh? - How is your credit rating? - My what? You ever had debts or not paid your bills or rent? - No. You? - I've got previous. I won't get a thing. Want to live a little? - Do you want to? - I suppose so, yes. Wash time! We can do as we wish. Get a loan, we'll split it. - We'll never have to pay it off. - Why not? - We'll be long dead. - We can't. That's not fair! Fair?! ls us dying fair, or your stupid hair colour? - Stupid? -It's orange. -It's blond. -It's almost red. How do you think the people we'll take it from got it? This crap has to got to be good for something. Now bend over, please. - You want to go out? - Yes. - Out, out? - Do you see a bank clerk here? Impossible, I have no immune system. If I get a cold, then goodnight Eileen. Not to mention the moral objections that I... So you want to leave something behind? You want people to know who you were? We'll start a blog. Not like the shit you do. Two dying guys screwing the system. We get money and do everything the losers out there dream of. And we'll post it all. And then, when we both say, "That was the most beautiful day of our lives," And then, when we both say, "That was the most beautiful day of our lives," then we'll end it. And after our final post, Andi, believe me everyone will know who you are. Deal? Deal. You have to shake on it. - This is Andi. - Okay. And I'm Andi. Um... Again. - This is Benno. - This is Andi. - Benno has cancer. - And he has phimosis. What? Fibrosis. - What did I say? - Phimosis. What's the difference? Dying has many drawbacks. For instance, water retention. Here. Dying has many drawbacks. For instance, water retention. Here. And your nose, your airways, get raw. Due to these... - That's Benno's tumour. - No, it's not my tumour! Dying also has advantages. - What were they again? - Are you still at it? Yes, that's fabulous. Agreement... small print... There. Right. Now you sign here, please. Congratulations. Would you like an espresso from our barista machine? That's it? - Um, yes. - So I... He's got the loan? - Of course. - Yes! Right. So do we go pick up the money from the clerk at the counter or...? So do we go pick up the money from the clerk at the counter or...? Ah, I don't get... Oh, you... You thought you could take the money with you just like that? Of course not. You thought: swoosh, in a carrier bag and off we go? - That'd be silly, huh? - Are you in such a hurry? Of course not. You look like Michael Jackson. Sorry. If all I had were metastases, I'd be cool. My lymph nodes are swollen. If all I had were metastases, I'd be cool. My lymph nodes are swollen. That's because you're nearly dead. Now you figure out how we can get money. That's because you're nearly dead. Now you figure out how we can get money. No one will give us money. No one! No one's thick enough to give some prats off the street a load of cash without any kind of collateral. Who would be that barmy? Benno? 0% INTEREST WEDDING RINGS, NO MONEY DOWN Hey, the camera! 500 likes! Smile! Smile! How cool! Are you crazy?! - Lunatic! - Sorry, I... - Get out! - What? - I'm driving home. - You even got a license? - I'm an AA Plus member. - I didn't ask that. Keep driving, please. Keep driving! Keep driving. Okay, ready. I've got it. Okay, wait. I've got it. - Oh God! - Sorry. Um... I think I've got it. Wait. MUM & DAD 148! FOR LENI Benno? Benno! - Hello? - Hello, Mrs Winkelmann. It's me. I don't know if you remember me. - Benno. -Well, well! -ls Mona there, I... - No. - Can she maybe... - No. Listen, I know she's there and that Lent's with her. Get lost! I'll set the dog on you! I'm giving Leni this present no matter what. She's gone back to Cape Town. Thank God! Here to cause trouble again just before the big day! - Big day? - Her wedding. A very educated young man. Black, but we're not racist. He took her in the state she was in, which was decent of him. - He's a doctor. - Oh. - Yes. Without Borders. - Uh-huh. Leni doesn't need anything from you. Just look at you! I'm letting the dog out now. - You went out? - I'm leaving. - What? - I can't do this. I'm off to some beach. - I won't die here. - You can't do that! I can't? Take care of yourself, Andi. - Nice meeting you. - And the blog? You said we'd be famous. - Give me my half. - No. - Huh? - My credit, my money. - Pardon? - No most beautiful day, no cash. How about a knuckle sandwich? Where's the money? - I've hidden it. - Where? I'm not telling you. - Where?! - The pillow. God! Stop, Benno! Put it back or I'll tell them what you did. I'll tell Ms Patonga. I'll go to the police. What now? - I'm coming along. - What? How? Could you help me, perhaps? - What do you have in here? - A backup device. Oxygen tank. My sleep mask. - Shit! I need morphine! - It won't fit. - Without it I get panic attacks. - Then get it! -It's in the nurses' room! - Then go get it from there! - I can't do that alone! - That's not my problem. That is not my problem! Oh yes, it is your problem. Heavens! People have no concern for their health! But it ends the same for everyone! Damn! You dirty piece of shit! That was absolutely wonderful. SHERBERT I can't keep it up. Why are we rushing? You stole a boatload of morphine. The cops won't be far behind. Come on! I'll look in my book. - Where is Mombasa? - Africa. Riga. No, that'll be too cold. Malta, Shanghai... - Forget the book! - Melbourne... Leave it to chance. Anything south of the Equator. Eyes shut and point. Leave it to chance. Anything south of the Equator. Eyes shut and point. - No. - Eyes shut and point! Mombasa. - What?! - Look, a wheelchair! - Africa! Shouldn't we get vaccinations? - As if we need them! - Yes, true. - Fuck! - What now? - The toilet. Can't you go after security? - Is your backup in your carry-on? - Yes. Then give me your breathing thing. - Give it here! Do you trust me? - Of course not! Why? You crazy? This thing has to go... Oh, Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - That has to go on the conveyor. - Then I'll have to turn off the oxygen. - That has to go on the conveyor. - Then I'll have to turn off the oxygen. Will that be okay? In his state he's unlikely to fly into the World Trade Center. In his state he's unlikely to fly into the World Trade Center. Here. Take it yourself. What did you put in there? - Are you crazy?! - Hello, people. We're here in first class. It is totally bizarre. There is silver cutlery here. There are cloth napkins. And dead orchids at every seat. There are cloth napkins. And dead orchids at every seat. Look, Andi can't contain his joy. Here, hold it. Hold it. Everyone's grumpy because people snore like in economy. And the ticket cost... Hold on to your hats! 7,000 big ones! And the ticket cost... Hold on to your hats! 7,000 big ones! But we don't have to pay for a return flight. Are you crazy?! Put that away! - They'll think we're terrorists! - Some wine? Here we have a 1984 Chéteauneuf-du-Pape and a... - Both, please. Everything you have. - Yes. - One moment. I'll get some more glasses. - Uh-huh, uh-huh. And a bit more caviar! - It doesn't taste as shit as it looks. - Put that away! Nobody's forcing you to come. Give me my money and fly back. - That was a crap idea. - Come on, Andi! We need drama. Now everyone wants to know how it ends. The blog will go wild when we blow our brains out. That's how the world is. Cancer blogs are boring. I can get rid of it. I'll put it in the Russian's hand luggage. No, no, no! - Benno, please just put it back in here. - Pardon? - Benno, please just put it back in here. - Pardon? Put the gun back in the rucksack, okay? -"Thank you, Benno." - Huh? "Thanks, Benno. Good idea, Benno." Say it. What? "Thanks, Benno. Good idea, Benno." Thanks, Benno. Good idea, Benno. - Here you are. - Thank you. To the most beautiful day! Screw you. Cool. - Way cool. - Are you enjoying it? Massively. Me too. - I'm a bit hot. - Go in the water. With my breathing device? Oh, yeah. Maybe we should make a video. Maybe a photo's enough. Come on. Oh, God... Do you already know what you want to do? You should get started. Yeah, I've thought of a few cool things already. - Show me. - No. - You've got nothing. - Rubbish! You think nothing's good enough. You can't even manage a list. You think nothing's good enough. You can't even manage a list. So what are your big plans? Well now, I have a lomi lomi massage at four, hot-stone therapy at five, then the all-you-can-eat buffet. Oh, yeah? That's funny, because I'll be doing this. A pedicure? Yes. I'm having a pedicure. I'm going in to post the photo. Oh, yeah... Here, for the massage. And this here is for the drinks. Thanks, Mum. Should anything befall me... I am the only one with the combination to the room safe. Andi, this isn't a James Bond film. "James Bond film"! 18,4113... - HOW COOL ARE YOU GUYS?! - WHAAT! - YOU ROCK! - WHERE ARE YOU? I'M COMING! "Interviews with dying people..." For days I've been trying to collect these thoughts and realise I'm grabbing onto nothing. But there is one thing I do know. I remember kissing you that first time. But there is one thing I do know. I remember kissing you that first time. I remember it clearly. My bra was poking me. It was a very fancy pointy bra, as was the fashion back then. But it really hurt! I really couldn't bear it. But I couldn't tell you. That's why I had that laughing fit. But I couldn't tell you. That's why I had that laughing fit. And you took it personally, my love. And you sat there, totally bewildered, all slender and confused. And you sat there, totally bewildered, all slender and confused. That's when I fell in love, as I have been every day since then. And I'll take that with me after forgetting all else, even myself. And I'll take that with me after forgetting all else, even myself. I had you and you had me. What else can one wish for? It's cold. There's frost on the windows. You'll catch your death! It's cold. There's frost on the windows. You'll catch your death! - Have you ever really been in love? - Why do you ask? - When did you last sleep with a woman? - Why? Oh, just asking. No! Really? - No! - Never? Oh nonsense! Well, it has been a while, but... It is tough with that hair colour. What's in the box? Okay, listen here. Then the time has arrived! I look like Uschi Glas. Oh! All I get are complaints! Wear something manly, open some bubbly. I'll line up some birds. See you in a sec! Hi. Hi. Yeah, well, sort of. Okay. Which one do you want? Tall or short? - I'll take the short one. - And if something happens? We need a code word. No we don't. They don't understand a word! We need a code word. No we don't. They don't understand a word! - Benno! - Just call for help. Yeah, I can tell. No idea. Blitzkrieg. You have very nice Dinger. Goebbels. Reichsparteitag. Great! Great! Ribbentrop, VW Käfer, Kraft durch Freude. Autobahn, Eva Hermann, keine Ahnung... Have you lost it? Benno... Help! Are you okay? Fuck! Shit! Shut your gob, yeah? Hm, well... I've experienced a few things, but... I was almost gone. - Huh? - Just now. It was the weirdest feeling, I was... It was as if... As if I was dying and at the same time I was... coming. Some people do call it "the little death". - So was that our most beautiful day? - No. This'll be tough to top. It's going to get way more beautiful than this. - Benno? - Yeah? 15,000 euros are missing. It's still in the safe. It was already gone before. I had to fork out some cash. What for? A good lie. The only thing I regret is that I waited too long. The only thing I regret is that I waited too long. In life you think it's over when you reach the next goal. In life you think it's over when you reach the next goal. "Then I can really live!" When I get my license, when I'm married. When the kids leave the house. When, when, when... There's always a new "when". I'd have loved to have seen the ocean again. There I go again, not living in the now. Hello? Benno? - Beautiful! - Hey, carrots! - What the hell is that? - Well... - We're going to the end of the world. - Are we? I can offer you the Cape of Good Hope. - In that tank? - I'm lucky I even got this. - Does it have Wi-Fi? - You can just stay here. Didn't you sleep? Yes. Hey, Andi, you haven't slept a wink since we left. - You're sleeping for two. -It's not sleep. I'm aware of everything. I just can't move. How does it make you feel? You can't hit back, you can't run away. You're vulnerable. A little bit like being in love. - So, tell me, are you in lo... - Read Gala! Don't be so uptight, I... Do you have kids? Look! Mozart. Now that's lovely. Did you play that too? - You want to shop here? - Where else? - In the hotel, where things are clean. - What is this?! Put it down! It'll give us parasites! Look! We need McDonald's! We need international standards. - Packaged food. What if we get the runs? - Don't be absurd! - Apropos. Did you see the camper toilet? - Doesn't work, it's full. - Where do we take a dump? - In a field. In a field! Sure. It was that pickled spider you ate. - It was a prawn. - It had hairs. Thanks! - So where are we sleeping tonight? - Here. - Here? - Yeah. Surrounded by 10,000 poisonous animals! Malaria-infested mosquitos, predators, snakes! - This isn't the Black Forest. - What's that? Where? - Is it gone?! Is it? - It was just a leaf. That's it. We're sleeping in the city. Fuck! Okay. Africa looked different on television. Benno? You asleep? - You wanted the city. - I thought there'd be a hotel. Just sleep. - Did you lock up? - Yep. The door isn't very thick. Do you have the gun? Huh? - As a deterrent. Blacks are very poor. - Is this Pegida or something? - As a deterrent. Blacks are very poor. - Is this Pegida or something? We're in a carton on wheels. Two fat, terminally ill, white-boy packets of cash! And uninsured! Here I am! Come get me! - Here I am! Come get me! - Andi! - Please take your pill. - I don't want to. Then I won't be able to react. Lions only go after weak gazelles. Then I won't be able to react. Lions only go after weak gazelles. I can't run fast. It's funny. Do you know that? I drift off and fall asleep. Then, suddenly, I'm wide awake. You know that? Shut up or I'll give you enough morphine to make you sleep like Snow White! Shut up or I'll give you enough morphine to make you sleep like Snow White! Sleeping Beauty. Shit! Andi. Hey, hey! Look at me. Where's the morphine? - No. - Yes! - I'll sleep too deeply. - So? - The oxygen will stop. - Why would it? No one's keeping watch. There's no alarm. Okay, that's enough. Get up! Get dressed. Wait! Where are we going? You need a reason to be afraid? I'll give you one. Are you totally mad? Give that back! Come and get it. - I'd rather suffocate. - Okay. I'll kill you! Oh fuck! - Open your eyes. - Screw you! - Okay, come on. Let's get it over with. - What? - Then it'll be done. - What?! - Stand up. - No way! Okay. Benno, they're super strong. Don't... Oh fuck! - Stand up. - No. - Okay. - Stop! They're way too strong! - We can do this till I've emptied this. - Hey! Listen, we're going to fall off anyway. The only question is how we pass the time. - Do we do it afraid of falling? - Yes! The others are dying too. They just don't know it. Look at them! Shifting things back and forth, trapped in workaday crap. But not us! Don't you see? We're free! When you know you're dying, you get what's really important. Absolute clarity. Death is our... It's... Okay. - That was fast. - They make heroin out of it! You understand? Please no, Benno! - Stand up. - No. Stand up, Andi, and I'll give this back and you can get down. Come on. Okay. Upright. Look. What's the worst thing that could happen? You could fall. Okay now, imagine that... That we fall... No hold on! Imagine... we're flying. We're whirling around in the air, we have the wind in our faces and then... You know what, there is no "and then". There is no such thing as death. There's just the moment before it. - And it's not so bad. - That's true. - See? Nothing can happen to us. - Nothing at all. We're invulnerable. -Immortal. - Free! - Free! - We're free! - Can I have my thing back anyway? - Yeah. Never do that again, got it? Never again. What? This? - Benno! - Look, nothing can happen. - Stop! Stop! - Oh, it's like riding a bike drunk. Bad stuff happens when you're caref... Benno! Oh shit! Shit! Shit, shit! Oh fuck! Hello. Hey, give me your hand. Okay? - This one? - One or the other. Come on. Okay. Leni! Benno!Benno! Leni! Leni! Leni's falling down! Leni! I fucked it up. Look. The sun's about to come up. I expect it's going to be beautiful. Andi? Is this our most beautiful day? Neath; , Benno. It was pretty damn beautiful. Excusez-moi! Voudriez-vous he“: us'? - I can't do any more. - Okay. I'll drive now. The thing is... Andreas? Benno! Benno! Over here! I'll just lie down for five minutes, okay? Wake me if I breathe funny or the device acts up. - Okay. - Thanks. Don't fall asleep! Okay? I'm not tired anyway. Bastard! Benno. - I swear she was this close! - She peed on you? - We had a connection! - She marked you as inedible. You were right. Screw fear, we're invincible! Invincible! Oh, I have to wash myself. But we're invincible! Invincible! - Did you film it? - Fuck! Fucking Africa. At least do it properly. Little prick! What? 396,572! We've got 396,572 clicks! - Wow! - And the police are after us. Yeah. No turning back now. What's this? - None of your business. - Are these obituaries? Yes. I like to read what others cherished in life. - Figure out what you cherish! - Nothing comes to mind. - I get heart spasms thinking about it. - Listen to your gut! - So what's in your box? - What? See, we both have our secrets. 396,572. - We have to pay. - I gave him plenty. - Think he's in trouble? - No, it looks friendly. Get in, Peter Parker. - We have to go back. He needs help! - Cat piss doesn't make you invulnerable! - We have to go back. He needs help! - Cat piss doesn't make you invulnerable! - Where's the gun? - That was a metaphor! Are you totally crazy? - We have to go. Get him out! - Why are they after you? - Because he stole from them. - Nonsense! Benno, you're hurting him! Blood diamonds! - Are you nuts? - You can't leave him here. - Can't I? - They'll skin him alive. Andi, he has crack. He'll skin us alive! He wants to sell it in Johannesburg, for his family. For his mum with AIDS and 12 half-orphaned siblings? - How did you know that? - Oh, Andi! How naïve can you be! - Andi's day. - What? -My gut says he's staying. Andi's day! -No! Andi! No, no, no! Over my dead... Listen, the clarinet. Read it out loud. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. "I thought long about what I should tell you. It all suddenly becomes so heavy with meaning. I think I understood quite late what's most important in life. I think I understood quite late what's most important in life. It wasn't until you, my children, were born. Children shift the focal point around which your life revolves. Before that you just focus on yourself, and it gets boring. Things change very quickly with children. You freed me of the weight of my ego. It is lovely to die with my final thoughts being of you and not of myself. That eases my mind considerably." Shit! That's really... It's lovely. It's almost like with Brangelina. - A child suits you. - What? - A child suits you. - What the hell do you want from me? Who is Leni? You have a daughter? Don't be so stubborn! Why? How? How old is she? When did you last see her? - I never have. - Never? Mona took her away with her. - Okay. Where to? - Too far away for me to follow. Why? That's a good question. I think her family had other ideas. - And now they've got what they wanted. - How so? Oh, she's getting married. A really good guy. A Doctor Without Borders. Benno, you know what? I have an idea. - This is bullshit. No one cares. - Give it your all. All right, go! Dear Leni. This is how to make a candle if you're ever outside at night. When you peel an orange, it sticks to your hands. Here's the best trick... When you peel an orange, it sticks to your hands. Here's the best trick... Look, no scissors. Impress the boys, take a beer... A tuna can and string. You don't need a wick. Put it in on the side here... Put it up here... Use oil you can buy anywhere. Cheers! It makes a much nicer candle than a tuna can, and smells better. See! You can always get by somehow. Benno, are you already asleep? No. Where is the gun? In my jacket. - Does it even work? - I hope, for both our sakes. I don't want to die miserably. We're going to die with smiles on our faces. We'll help each other to get there. Exactly. Promise? - Potatoes. - Chips. I think I was a bit rash with the pills. I'll keep watch. - Really? - This time for real. Thanks. Goodnight, Andi. Whatever. Because if you fuck it up... - Morning! - Morning. - I slept really well. - Yeah, I know. - You really stayed awake? - Boy Friday made us breakfast. - You really stayed awake? - Boy Friday made us breakfast. - That said "Cape Town". - Oh yeah? - But in the other direction, Benno. - You didn't see right. - We're going to the wedding. - What? - To see Leni. They live in South Africa. - Nah. Oh, yeah? - What's this? - Give it here! - Give it here! - You can't be trusted! I want to see my daughter once in my life. Okay? You were screwing with me all this time. "Most beautiful day", my arse! Right! You were screwing with me all this time. "Most beautiful day", my arse! Right! I was your ticket to the end of the world. You wouldn't have a ticket! You'd still be lying on your deathbed! - You dragged me here! - You blackmailed me! - You're the biggest coward I know! - You're a fucking minim rest! - You're the biggest coward I know! - You're a fucking minim rest! Fuck, this is Paradise! Whoa! -It's a bad idea in your state. - Stop acting like we're friends. -It's a bad idea in your state. - Stop acting like we're friends. You just latched on to anyone you could get. I was just your last chance. Or did you really care about me? Huh? Tell me, Andi, are we friends? Right. Fuck! The gun! Not at all. And that was the moment when Mona stumbled into the hotel room with another guy in tow. Pay attention, Mona dear. - I mean, that'd... - Hello, Sandra. - Oh God! - Don't mind me. Carry on. Enjoy your party. Leni and I will just go and chat a bit. - Got any pop? We've lots to catch up on. - Benno? This has your attention, huh? You wanted to rub me out, but she's my child! We found each other. Blood is thicker than your damn money! - Shut it, Plonker Without Borders! - Benno! - That girl isn't Leni. - What? Marvin and Mona they had a dream... No! Hey wait, that's mine. Sorry, that's not for you. Give it here! No! Hey wait, that's mine. Sorry, that's not for you. Give it here! Leni! Leni, wait. Leni! Leni! - Why are you here? - Just a little blast from the past. Bye! - Here's to the newlyweds! - What do I want? I brought this doll halfway across the globe. I have money, I want to start a college fund for her. - I want her to remember her father. - Are you drunk? A bit. Mona, I could've been a good father. - But this clearly wasn't enough. - Benno, don't start. - I didn't deliver, so you dumped me. - No one can live off your love. - But you can live off a rich doctor. - You and fucking money! - But you can live off a rich doctor. - You and fucking money! This isn't about fucking money! This is about you! - She's a child. - My child. How can I raise a child with a man who runs away when things get serious and is afraid of any bit of emotion? You still can't take his child from him. What? Is that what you tell people? You vanished. You took off, Benno. That's not true at all. What are you doing here? We're doing fine. We're happy. I wanted to say goodbye. - Now, today? - I don't have much time left. Why? I have cancer. Oh, Mona... You'd stoop to anything. You're really the worst thing that ever happened to me. - Mona! - Watch out! Don't be sad. I'm not sad. She's right. I just have to stay alone. I always got bad marks in school because I dozed off in class a lot and got into fights and stuff. Because I dozed off in class a lot and got into fights and stuff. When they wanted to send me to a special school my dad said I had been lying about dozing off. He said I was on drugs. I lied quite a lot back then, but not about that. And then he said, "Right, we're going to revise. And if you doze off, then I'll have to wake you up." And he did that. In his own special way. The more I cried, the more I dozed off and the more he woke me up. I swore I'd never cry again. And then? Nothing. I ran away the next day. And what about school? No need for it anymore. I managed without it. All day I've been wondering if there's a single person in my life who I haven't letdown. I can't think of one. - Fathers are dicks. - No, I understand. He busted a gut so his kids could have it better than he did. He busted a gut so his kids could have it better than he did. I rid him of that hope. -Apropos. -Apropos what? Ridding someone of something. That was probably worth something. Probably. We could have got money for that. This is better. I hate Mozart. I'm ravenous. Benno. Benno? Oh shit. Hey, calm down now. It'll pass. Give it a sec. Did you sleep outside? - Yes. Why? - For me? - Course not! - Ow! Wow. No way! That little rat, that little scumbag! I knew... - Oh God! I gave him money too. - What? Um, a bit of money for his education. - You crazy? Me too. - Yeah, I thought... - What? - For his mother. That's the lamest story ever! We didn't need it. I told him to go home. - Not in our van! - No. I told him to take a bus. Well that's not a bus! What's so funny about this? Then this is my last oxygen tank. I can't go on. I can't go on. - I won't make it up the mountain. - What mountain? This is a crap ending. I find it somehow fitting. To sum up. Africa, cold as hell. - We were robbed. - By a little boy. - You messed things up with Leni. - You're not famous. - So where's the most beautiful day? - Good question. - But it's nice here. - We should really take a selfie. Fuck! Shit! Shit! I haven't filmed anything for two days now. Hey! We still have the grand finale. -It's been an honour. - For me too. Andi. I think I'd like to start over. Well... Okay. It works great. It works. All right then. I'll start. - Who's going to post it? - Sorry? - If we're dead, who's going to post it? - Fuck! What idiots! Well, I... Oh screw it. Screw it. So long, Andi. Wait! What'll I do? There'll be brains and blood all over the place. Okay, you start. - You got a cold? - What? It was a joke. - You have to press. - I want to, but my finger doesn't. Oh, dude! Open your mouth. - But warn me, okay? - Okay, I will. - No, don't warn me. - Okay, I won't. - What? - I can't smile. - You said we'd die smiling. - This is absurd! - I can't smile. -It's either me or you. - Do you want to start or not? - Of course! Then start! We can wait till the oxygen... - What is that? - That is... It's here somewhere. What is it? - My pager. - What? -It's my pager. - Your... You know what this means? My lung! They have a lung for me! Shit! What'll we do? How do we get out of here? Benno, I knew it! I knew it! Benno, it's so... Oh God, I'm sorry. Benno, I knew it! I knew it! Benno, it's so... Oh God, I'm sorry. -It's a set-up. - What? The cops are after us. Of course they want us back. - Smuggling drugs, stealing 140,000! - You just want me to stay. - Smuggling drugs, stealing 140,000! - You just want me to stay. - Dude, we post it all. - You're jealous. What? You're jealous because I get to live and you don't. Go fuck yourself, Andi. Yeah, go on! I'll get home alone! Oh, blessed Germany! Africa was a piece of cake, but I caught a cold on the plane. - Oh well, I'm ready for you. - I beg your pardon? I haven't eaten for over six hours. Nil by mouth. - To put it mildly, this is awkward. - You paged me. - Now I'm here. - We hoped you'd call. - You gave my lung to someone else? - Um... No. - No? - Uh-uh. Thank God! - My cold is nothing at all. - Good! I need to be changed. I can't not eat much longer. Two days ago a 60-year-old man was brought in here. He was having seizures and bleeding from the oesophagus. He had had an MRT, but it was from two weeks ago. The results were negative. He died in A&E. - Why are you telling me this? - I didn't get it. Until I looked more closely at the images. These aren't of a 60 year old. These are images taken of a younger man. I wouldn't know. We wanted to reach your friend. There is no lung. Oh, God! - I'm so very sorry. - No! Benno's going to blow his brains out! Mona, sorry. I meant to leave you in peace. - I cocked up, I can't change that. - What would you change? I want Leni to have a good life. You too. And I'd like to get to know Leni. You're a family. Marvin's a great guy. - No, he's an arse. - Enough! But you picked him. Wait! I'm going. You have to take Leni to hospital. But you picked him. Wait! I'm going. You have to take Leni to hospital. - I saw her collapse. - She has narcolepsy. - She's got the same thing you have. - Yes! No. What? That's why she collapses and sleeps so much. - No. - Yes. I'm a doctor. She has a tumour behind her nose. - That's not you. - Pardon? That's not even your name. Hello. - Hello. - I sleep a lot too. I know. I wasn't gone. I was in school. When you were pregnant. I had evening classes and worked on a construction site during the day. I had evening classes and worked on a construction site during the day. Maybe you should have told me that. I wanted to have something to show you, not just my empty promises. Benno, I'd have gone through anything with you. Anything- - I felt inadequate. - You didn't have to do anything. All you had to do was be by my side. Yeah. Mona, I meant everything I said before. I see you're happy. You have to stop making stuff up. You're not dying. I'm not dying. Oh fuck! Fuck, Andi! Morning. - I thought you'd never come back. - What? -It's a bit late, isn't it? - Why? He has an infection now. So? Have you finally become a man? - Yes, I think so. - Good. I have a bone to pick. We bust guts for this place. I have two-and-a-half-hour bus ride here and back. I get so tired my husband says I look like a potato kept in the fridge. I get so tired my husband says I look like a potato kept in the fridge. We don't do it to be millionaires or to watch people suffer. We think everyone has a right to die with a bit of dignity. You could at least show a little respect. Have I made myself clear? - I think so. - Good. Right, we don't want to lose any time. Oh, I've tripped up with the bedpan! Oh heavens! Did some spill on you? How terrible! Let's get your shoes off. Because it's really disgusting. Urine is very pungent. Andi. Hey, Andi, are you asleep? What a stupid question. Of course not. Lucky you! I was about to kiss you awake, Snow White. Lucky you! I was about to kiss you awake, Snow White. - Sleeping Beauty. - No, it's Snow White. - Sleeping Beauty. - Who cares! I didn't think you would come. Yeah, tough luck! Now we'll take it off. It has such a pungent smell. - Do you like cats? - No. They're so good for patients' souls. They're so quiet, and then they purr. Or meow. Cup of tea? - You can't take the piss out of me! - Wait! Stop! Calling all cars, a patrol car has been stolen. It's headed towards the railway station. Shit! Floor it! lam! How many penalty points does that get me? Now they've got him. - They'll probably come back. - Yeah, probably. Is it painful? I have no idea, ask my pharmacist. Come on, you have to stick it out a bit longer. - Why? - I don't know. The sun's coming up. The trees are blossoming. It's sure to be lovely. - Sunrises are almost always shit. - Just a bit longer. Benno, where and when don't matter. All I care about is who's with me. Hey, not that. - Stop right now or you'll fall asleep. - Okay. - Pull yourself together. - All right. Hey, Benno, you're scared. Course not! Don't you see? That's not so bad. It means you have something to lose. Don't start with the calendar mottos just because you're dying. - No reason for intimacies. - Exactly. Benno? Andi. I think I've got it. The most beautiful day. And which one was it? In the end, it's quite simple. There's almost no wind at all. I have salt in my hair and I can taste tuna and orange juice. I have salt in my hair and I can taste tuna and orange juice. The sun isn't intense but my sunburn stings. Across from me sits Benno. It seems we've known each other forever. 17 days, to be exact. This only happened because of the terrible hospital mix-up. This only happened because of the terrible hospital mix-up. My client was certain he was going to die. Then it's only fair, considering this misdiagnosis... Then it's only fair, considering this misdiagnosis... Excuse me. I don't want that. What? The diagnosis was the best thing that ever happened to me. Benno is strange. We don't even really like each other. Benno is my best friend. Subtitles: N. Fritz, H. Kimber CINEMEDIA audiovision 2016
