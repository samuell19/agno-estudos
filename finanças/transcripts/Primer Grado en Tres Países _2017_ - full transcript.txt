Good morning! Time to wake up! - Hi! - what's up? - Hello! - Hi Caro! How are you? - Fine. How was the start of school? It was fine. I was surprised they let the parents inside the classroom. They let us see where the children sit. Watch the classroom. The teacher spoke a bit. It were five or ten minutes, but I was surprised they let us in. No activities, but they let us know the classroom. Wake up Juan, wake up. The rooster crows. August 2015 A public school can be fine, depending of the people attending. We live in a hood where Leo could have gone with an 80% immigrant students. That means they are worst at french. I don't know why that's a prejudice. I don't know what's the prejudice but I didn't wanted to try. What day is it today? I can't say because I don't like it. What day is today? What's going on? - I don't like it. What don't you like? I hate that recess is over. Wake up Juan, wake up Juan. Monday? - Monday. What's going on today? Where are you going? Classes start today! Winter recess ends. - Stop it! Well, I will prepare breakfast. First School Grade in three countries August 2014 Julia starts first grade in Helsinki (Finland) Here I have no option. It's public school. The good thing it's that the level will be good everywhere. Other friends were going to this school so we apply for it and got it. But the education is good everywhere. A little bird! Did you know you can do it with money? You can buy tools to build a treehouse. Buy food for the birds. I told you I was very excited now that school starts It was gonna be in the same hours and I was gonna meet the parents. - Yes! - Well, welcome to Finland, Agustina! The first day all the parents took photos, filmed, watched. The next day when I go pick up Julia, no one. All the kids go back alone. You were the only one? - I was! Tuesday at noon. I go out at that time too. Then tuesday is better. Yes. Ok, that's great. Hi Juli. And then I feel that difference. How would Julia feel if I'm the only one that goes pick her up. She told me she wanted to come back alone. And wants a phone. Because all the kids have phones and go home alone. And so now I let her go with our little neighbors. The three go out together. Did you salute your sister? Look at what that sweet child is doing! We choose a public school in mixed neighborhood. September 2014 Leo starts classes in Roubaix (France) Which means there's children from different social backgrounds. You have to travel a lot to take him? Just a kilometer, it's nothing. But a kilometer away, the scene is totally different. It's another thing. It's unfair, because the school I change him to, have music and english studies. It has a lot of extracurricular activities that are pretty good. The problems are different. Schools give different opportunities according to your place. Are you ready to start first grade? Yeah? Kind of? "Will I play soccer besides having science classes" that's his bigger concern. There's no problem with a lot of students but well... This year there's rugby, but soccer I don't know. I need to know if he's gonna go to the dinner and the day care. Yes. And tomorrow? - Yes. What's going on? - Nothing, I'm excited. What was your impression? - Fine, good. Did you liked the teacher? - Yeah I liked her alot. Why are you crying? September 2014 Buenos Aires, Argentina While Julia and Leo start first grade in Europe, in Buenos Aires Gero finishes preschool. We need to pick a primary school for him. We went to public schools, like most kids in our childhood. Like most kids we went to the closest school to our home. Our parents didn't choose school because they trusted they were all the same. Chose? That's a verb from this times. What do you think about while choosing schools? I think public school can have more diversity of backgrounds. And that's something I want to pass on. For me school is more than just knowledge and quality education, about contents. But also the values that are passed to the children and the citizens and world we want to build. I'm a biology professor, work on the ORT school as teacher and had excellent students who work well. They did fine, had great redaction. So I ask them what school they went. They said Integral Caballito, so I search about it and loved it. You went to a public school? I went to a primary public school, then in high school went to the Carlos Pellegrini. Hello my friends, did you know that I... I found this dove feathers. Another feather! What do you think about public school today? With all that diversity, we need to include all children. And the teachers maybe need to lower the bar so everyone can be included. It happens to me as a professor in a Public school. Maybe the academic level can be lowered but I didn't look for those things. I just look for the results. They are going to Jesus House School. It's a very old school. Traditional. It has to do with my personality and things I like. I feel safe and contained in a traditional environment. In what I can predict. That's a school for me. Hello little friend. Hi, I will crash you to death! Four. One, two, three, four. Fourteen. There's a point in which it's not about public or private schools. It's not the same a private school than another one. And the same goes with public schools. What scares you about public schools? More kids in each classroom. It depends of the school but there's more kids than in a private one. I wonder how can they look each kid, when there're so many for each teacher. Little poo, little poo... Little poo, little poo! Not a public school because I need double schooling, and those I've founded are only simple. That's one of my requirements. It's very difficult to schedule activities for a boy and a girl, at that age, and one mother. Dante you start first grade next year? -Yes! What school will you be attending? The one with Benja, Mirco, Matias and Leon. Did you already know it? - Yes. And how was it? - Fine. There will be soccer and ballet. We'll learn english too. And Gera, why do you want them to go to a public school? I think we shouldn't have to do a monthly payment, especially as high as is requested now to have a reasonable education. I knew what kind of school I wanted and search in the area. I wanted then to have a big yard so they could run during recess. Private schools rarely have those. What I remember fondly from my own school is lots of space to run and have a good time. Offside! There's clothing there! No! That's the goalpost! Goal! They have gym and after fall break, they told us they had to learn to bathe themselves. Because they take showers at school. And what about the bathrooms? There's one for girls and one for boys. I ask them if there was someone older watching them. And they said they were alone and the teacher was outside. And are they all together or are the showers individual? Are those showers? They see each other naked. That how it is in the girls one. It's very normal here. You go to the pool and know everyone from the neighborhood. In France Leo goes to the pool, twice each week since february. They search for parents to help kids get dress. Two times each week they need 3 or 4 parents to go with them. To help kids dress up and with all the stuff. But kids are not so... How did you say? Self-sufficient like in Finland. Well in Finland they need to dress up alone at age 3. Because in winter you need to put on so many clothing. That if the teachers had to dress up all kids, they would never go out. Raise your legs Milo! Rise your feet! Very good! So here my kids know how to dress up since... Very fast compared to Argentina. Up! What are you looking for? - I was watching that. I put it there so they see you wake up. You did it well. - Yeah? Little glasses. Take this. Little foot. Another foot. Up! It's very pretty, the sky cleared. Let's go. What does people think about the school in France now? Teachers and school are challenged or not? It's always being questioned. They say it reproduces too many social patterns. There's always the stigma of the son the worker that will end up bad. The businessman's son will end up fine. That elitism put the school in France in question. We have a meeting in Leo's school after the first week. All the parents were invited. We sat there and realised that the more capable children sit at the back of the class. They put them like that? Watch out, here comes a terrible one! ...and they were at the back of the classroom. And the others are in the front of the class. There's a ranking, the teacher does this for their good. She puts the bad ones in front and the good ones behind, but she does a ranking without thinking about it. And I think the kids feel this. I see this as difficult. In France this is worst. In my generation we used to have a report card, with the report card set by best results. You had the first one, second and third best of the class. And you knew who was the worst student in class. That's awful! It changed a bit, but there's still a bit of that. When you are first one, you love school, but as the last one you hate it. Jauregui. A town of 5000 people, along the banks of the river Lujan. At one hour driving from Buenos Aires City. Part of our family lives here and we sometimes dream about moving here. Which school could we send Geronimo here? Are you from Jaugueri? Yes, we lived here from years now. What school does your kids go? - San Luis Gonzaga. Why that one? For me it was the best teaching values. Here the children come at the morning and the director is waiting for them at the door. He greet them with a kiss and knows everyone's name. That's really surprising because you don't see it anywhere. We are a big family here. We go to the club, the kids play soccer and hockey and take english classes together. All the kids do the same and the parent make friends with each other because we search for the same thing, and we value that a lot. What school do you got to? - San Luis Gonzaga. What grade are you at? - Fifth... third.. I'm at fifth. He's in fifth grade, so is he and she. Third, third and sixth grades. Whoever studies in the Gonzaga carries a backpack for life. With their values, the person they are and helping your neighbour. I have a student in primary and secondary school too. And we want them to finish school with an educational context that they can learn at any school. But these values can't be teach at any school. You live that from their director, teachers and staff who think the same. What do you enjoy the most about school? I like natural sciences. I like animals, cats and dogs. Animals of all sorts. Even if they are wild animals I like them. I like that and the solar system too. Do you live here? We live a block away. Out three kids are born here and raised in the club. They always went to school here, but Bautista couldn't adapt to a traditional school. He needed to develop his artistic side. We send him to a Waldorf school, and it's a wonderful place. It has a lot of values that other schools don't have. Is more natural, with organic food. You know where the food comes from. And Jauregui public school? Jauregui has a public school, but very little students. Very few children. Almost everybody chooses private schools for it's safety. That we need at this times we are living in. You went to a public or private school? Public school. I'm from the province, in Bragado. There you don't have private schools. I went to a public school a long time ago. There were no teacher's strikes, it was a simpler time. I was in a private primary school, but did secondary school in a public one. In an industrial school. Is how Sandra was saying, about the damage of the teacher's image. That's what made the view of the public school fall from grace. That's how we see things. I went to a private school, my husband always to a public one. He keeps insisting our children should go to public school. But well... no. I won't send them. I don't know. Caro and the private vs. public school is in debate there? Everyone goes to public school? No! You can choose. The parents that want to avoid certain schools can do it. They are organized for catholicism, and they are not for profit. So private schools are catholic. That's the great majority of cases. Now you also have muslim ones. That's because you are living in the province. Here could be the same in the province. But in Paris? Maybe there you have private schools with no subsidy. Maybe for very lucky people, but those are not common. Is like Argentina when we were kids. Then everyone went to a public school unless they were very religious or very rich. Let's back to Buenos Aires. If our family were an upper-middle class family living in the north of the city, our son would go to this school. This is a way to handle children in an integral way. It goes beyond the work in the classroom. We try to open a window to what kids can develop. The body movement, language, beyond the written word. The way to express themselves, art, theater, photography, technology. There you can see how wide of a proposal this school has. Which is it's most unique point of view. The teachers are different and the parents know this, by their cultural, methodological and pedagogic approach and the way in which they engage with every single child. That you can see in it's good mood. The school is good humored. We try to find the most emotional and caring ways. We appeal to affection, laughter and good humor. Instead of a stiff educational model. For us it's a big challenge to generate regulatory frameworks. Not only with the teaching staff, but also with families and children alike. One of the challenges we have to build that framework, with children and grown ups. It has to do with the way we build authority. That's something we give a lot of thought. That a penalty don't become a bureaucratic report to the family. But that kids turn that into something that makes them stronger, and better citizens. We have it written as part of the school's internal publication. Every year this is updated. The children take it in their backpacks and binders. They know they have this norms that regulate and preserve them. That they can go to when there's the need to chat about what's going on. Most families come from a cultural background that the school read according to their features. There's lots of doctors, psychologists, teachers, professionals. They know that here, the academic world is guarantee to have a particular experience. And at each learning stage they will get a mix of different situations that challenge them. If we were a poor family, living in the south of the city... our son would probably go to this school. Last year, a friend from my neighbors told me her son had troubles in school, that the principal treated him badly. She told her he was insane and so on. It seems the kid didn't got it. I ask about his school. At a school four blocks from my own. I already recieved parents asking to enter my school. Because they were mistreated, or behaved badly. They didn't let children with disabilities enter. The principal told them they had no classrooms. A school that highly discriminates it's students. But this friend who is an artist, very cool and full of herself. I still have not tell her I was the principal of the school. So I told her: "Why don't you try with the School 4?" "The school in Solis". "The Solis one? They let anyone in!" I knew she was saying it as a bad thing. And it gave me this discomfort. And so I told her: "Yes, anyone can enter and I'm the principal And that's the good thing about the school. Anyone can get in". "What did you mean by anyone?" Like any other school from the area, a lot of the children live in hotels. The sheds in the area have also the problem of constant migration. Inside the same hood too. Because they can't pay the hotel. Or the city government stopped paying their benefit and they have to leave. So they go to another one three blocks away. But that messes with their already weak structure. These kids live moving all the time. Raquel Waldhorn was the principal of Tomas Espora School until 2014 when she retired. This images are a memory of her last day in charge of the school. It would be good to have more middle class in school. Because middle class parents can also collaborate with the school. They can demand stuff and go together. There's an exclusion problem that also started at school, When a couple of friends, he's an architect and she a graphic designer. they were looking for a school and went to a school three blocks away from their home. And after talking to the principal she told them their son was not for that school. If she says that to 10 kids, sure... If she told them that the school is wonderful to their kid to those 10 she would had 10 families of middle class from the neighborhood. I have friends who lied about their address, to get their kids into a prestigious school, that maybe is 20 blocks away from their home. Then what values are we talking about? They want a prestigious public school. Lying. Then I lie like the people in the slums. The people there, as soon as they can save some money send their kids to private school. And they have to lie about their address or they won't enter in a private school. And what do the teachers say? This shit people that lie about their address so no one knows they come from the slums. Up! My beautiful baby! Today start school! March 2015 Geronimo starts first grade in Buenos Aires. Soon I won't be able to tell you baby anymore. You are gonna be a big boy. I roll your sleeve? - No, like that. Ready! Beautiful. Let's go? Are you gonna take a picture? Don't close your eyes! Put a normal face. We are a middle class family. We live in Caballito, a middle class neighborhood. And this will be our son's school. The first impression is that it looks pretty good. The Parents Auxiliary works well, it has a nice library, a laboratory... Computer room, and all the stuff that the the Parents Auxiliary did. In Argentina the quality of the building and equipment depends on that organization. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon teachers. We are gonna start the 2015 school term. Who is missing? Where is the seventh grade? Sixth grade? I don't see them. And fifth grade? Fourth? The younger children? Second and third grade? Are we all? Who is missing? First grade. Who is missing? - First grade! Today is the first day of the youngest in school, they start first grade. They are gonna be with miss Mariela. Let's greet them with an applause. The kids enter when all the other children were inside. And they entered one by one with all the people surrounding them. And they sit them in this bleachers. And the teacher told us we could take them all the pictures we wanted. Caro was here that day. I knew she was gonna be there and could assist. For Caro it was a real experience. It was very theatrical for the kids entering first grade. It was incredible. How they are presented, all the scene. It was very theatrical. We will sing the national anthem. My first day of school was totally different. My parent let me at the door, and I remember the panic. They made us stand in rows and then go to class. And I was asking who is this people, and how is this thing gonna be? And looking around and feeling loneliness. I remember my first day, being in rows like you say. Girls at one side, boys on the other. And everything so serious. Hear, mortals, the sacred cry: "Freedom, freedom, freedom" "Hear the sound of broken chains, see noble equality enthroned". You doubt about public and private. You had that pressure of "if I put him in a private school it will end up better". And he will end up with a better chance in life. You and Alejandro had that debate. I had lucky because we have a good teacher. Public schools had that, you can't choose teachers. I'm very worried about stimulating Gero's passion for knowledge. I want that the school keeps feeding his learning urges. I think that depends of the teacher, like you said also the principal, but not if the school is private or public. You know what you're gonna do with this poster? In this white paper, you are gonna write your name. Now in secondary school I would think more about what you say Caro. About what job opportunities the school with facilitate. I think more about those aspects in secondary school. Do you have silver? - I do, look at it. I don't have silver. Write your name and drew whatever you like in the rest of the paper. And the parents will have to write a message to their kids. That they want their children to read in the future. Maybe the difference with France is that at the end of primary school kids do chose. When they are nine years old some kids choose technical careers, like electrician and plumber. Maybe we worry before. - They are so young. At 11 they are outside the mainstream because results are no good. They do tests in France at first grade level? Yes, they are evaluated. In Finland don't. For example Julia didn't had any test. She never told us "I have to study, tomorrow I have a test". But the teachers do some internal evaluation. Here in Argentina is the same. There was a parents meeting and the teacher said: "I took a test on the children without telling them it was a test". She didn't want to create distress in the kids or the families. And she gave it to us to sign it, and told us: "this was a test". Ten plus ten is twenty. Yes. Well, I already did those, now these. Eight minus one is... seven. One minus six, is... - One minus six? One minus... no, six minus one. Five. Seven minus one is six. Four minus one is... Three. In France they are tested since last year. Since last year? Beginning of first grade? Since preschool. - Since preschool? Wow! They don't put grades, but test if this and that is ok. And that creates a certain pressure. Of course! Only one time they ask her to pay attention in something of her writing that I don't remember what it was. Then the rest were all positive marks With Gero the same, they don't give negative marks. She didn't correct this one, and the ones I painted with marker. She didn't correct this one either because I went outside the paper. This one either and this one... she did correct this one. What did she grade it with? - This. I don't know why she didn't correct the other ones. Maybe she didn't saw those yet. Coffee shop, candy store. Pa... bakery, candy store. Don't shoot me! Read something else. That one. Ba-ke-ry. Co-ffee-shop. "Roel". Lunch service. Dishes. That's it. - That's it? She called for a meeting one month after the start of classes. The objective was to tell us how they teach Math and Language. Before it was Language, not it's called Language practice. They wanted to tell us so when we help in home we use the same technique. For example in math they don't do vertical calculations. If they do 25+15, they don't put one over the other. Look at that, in France they do it like that. Here it was like that before. Julia is doing simple math in Finland and it's all horizontal. They don't talk about units like tens and hundreds. You saw that we... Nothing to do with what they teach here. Incredible! And then? They talk about tens but in another way. The idea is that they find their way of doing math without map it out. They have this thing called "number castle". And they can use it as reference to find their way, that's what I understood. You say there's not a big difference between teaching methods? In the content. What I do notice is very different are the books. Especially the language book. Like I said before, Julia's one has options. A kid that doesn't read yet has the same chapter that Julia but in the same chapter they have sounds and syllables. The pages are 4 per unit. In the first two pages there's the letter they are studying. For example the M, combined with the A, the E and whatever. In the second page there's sentences and the last ones there's text. But they learn different stuff. I mean one is learning syllables and the other sentences. Yes, but they end up coming together. Teaching is going through big changes. Because next year we start a new curricula and this will be very different to what we have work with this far. For example in Natural Sciences, we have this curricula. In which we has all the subject to deal with in class. Like the plants the kids need to know. In the new curricula there's only one skill with one subject. And teachers can choose what content is better to teach that skill. This curricula give is a lot of freedom. And we want that kids can... that the information reach them. That we don't be just information deliverers. But this curricula works towards a child with an active role. And develop thinking skills. Who do the trees do it? How do you do a pencil case with a tree? See if all your pencils are sharpen. Separate those that do and don't. Sharpen, sharpen, sharpen... Sharpen, blunt, sharpen... Sharpen, blunt, sharpen... Sharpen... Blunt. Very sharpen! I was talking with Leo's teacher and she told us that parents need to be demanding. Because she demands a lot from the kids. And if there's not a follow up in home, that demand doesn't work. That's the opposite to what the teacher told us. Maybe it's because the french language is known to be difficult. At one point kids could write as they listen. But at some point they need to learn a list of words. And how these words are written. At the beginning they also wrote phonetically. And it was fine. But if they make mistakes, like jump letters... Now they have to know those words by heart. Because the letter O can be written in four different ways. One day they learn to write the AU, and have a list of ten words that are written that way. And if make a mistake it's corrected. If it's wrong the little face is angry instead of happy. The system is very different, maybe because of the language. But I think it's another teaching style. Yeah it's another ideology. What you talk about sounds like the Montessori method. To respect the children's times, something more personal. A family tree is a tree... With the grandparents. Says Sofía. Ousmane say his grampa is not going into the tree. Ousmane's grandpa doesn't want to give him a picture. His picture in a tree! No! Ousmane is afraid. He's fearful that Sofia and the others mock him. His the only kid with a grandpa called Karamoku. Sofia tells him: you are lucky. To have a grandpa who tells you stories. So, you never spoke with Leo's teacher? At the start of class we have a meeting with her. And she told us how the year was gonna be like. Yes. Parents are not invited to go to school, you see. It's not a place for parents at certain point. It bothers the teachers. It's bothersome. They don't ask you to participate, it's weird. The house and school are two different things, and they don't mix easily. Well here is the same. Here it's understood that everything they do is ok. They don't ask you to sign any permits. The school decides what's best and you don't have anything to say about. I'm disconcerted, maybe because in Argentina you know everyone in school. You knew the parents and have a daily relationship with the teachers. Here we already had four meetings with the teacher. A lot! Also at the end of class she is present when the kids get out. So you can ask her something. My perception as a mother is that there's little room to get close to the school. My door is open every time you need to see me. Since day one I told you I'm available at any moment. But parents are not used to get close to the schools. Compared with Argentina, where Leo grew up. There's no tradition of parents involved in the school life. Oh no, there's a lot. You have to see how things progress. We ask them for help with tours. And many parents come to my classes in different situations. And I ask her if it's difficult to have contact with the school. And she said she's available at any moment. But that's something you don't know how to ask. I have little doubts, and I'm not gonna summon a meeting for a small thing. What you are saying Caro about how you can't access the teacher, and can't talk. Here in Argentina that would create a lot of fear about how's the teacher. They are under a lot of scrutiny. Here is rare to know someone who you think is not capable, because selection is different. Last year a professor told me that only one of every ten people that apply to be a teacher in Finland got it. That can be true. Good morning! You can sit. Stand again! Now one, two three! Today the subject are american indians. How many of you know where Argentina is? Messi plays there. Yes, Messi plays there. Morris! - Is in South America. Very good! So we know where Argentina is. Let's sing the second verse. One, two, three, four. Corn is yellow, the moon is rising. The Milky Way shines in a droplet of dew. The loafer doesn't even step over a reed. Where the indian girl with the golden hair goes by. Welcome ladies and gentlemen. To the technical workroom from the Vousaaren school in Finland. In Finland the teacher's position still invokes a lot of respect. Some teachers could have been lawyers, doctors or engineers. But choose to be teachers, for some inner calling. When I take my car to be fixed, we make jokes, but they respect me. A receive a special treatment for being a teacher. Currently a lot of people question teachers. Sometimes teachers don't say what the parents want to hear. And we give them a different view of their children. This is something very important. And currently the role of the teacher is undermined by our society. I want to thank you from all of the teachers. Each of you for your backing up. It was a difficult year, very intense. But with a lot of learning. Sometimes I'm like the "singing voice". But when I speak in on behalf of all the teachers. And that's because we have agree on it beforehand. I hope I didn't discomfort you. And I hope you had time to reflect on what we told you from this side. Thank you all, enjoy your vacations. And I see you next year. The group demanded me to be in a state of constant alert. All the time aware of their stand inside the classroom. Their behavior, and don't forget to teach at that point. Why? Because they are very uneasy and you have to pay attention to it. Otherwise you loose the class. Happy holidays. By Cori, happy holidays! - Thank you. To you too. Happy holidays Gero! Say thank you. About the criteria of corrections, Gero never got any negative one. Never a negative or regular note. Or how the mom from France told us, an angry face. You don't use angry faces. No, no. I don't use angry faces to grade students. There's always something positive to value from each kid. And I think that's what we need to highlight. The effort they put into it. Beyond the results they got, if it's the same or not. But how hard they work and their effort. If I use an ugly face, that kid may never want to try writing something or solving a problem. The first thing he's gonna think about, is "she's gonna give me an ugly face". That's not the idea. This is me. It's me going to the park. And this one? - Is a story I wrote. You alone? Yes. It's about a dragon, I mean a crocodile. Can you read it to me? Once upon a time there was a crocodile that liked... A lot. Read it yourself. "To ride in a skateboard". Let's go, read it. You! Then he went to the forest each day to ride. But he was... - Too fast. Too fast and... One day he crashed. What does it say? Little... knew that... He learned that crocodiles can't ride in skateboards. He said "this isn't for me". I wrote it with Jazmin. Pretty good! This is a dragon puppet. This is me screaming at mom. Why are you screaming at me? I am angry at you. Why did you draw yourself angry at me? We had to do something that make us angry. The teacher told you that... We read a story of a kid. What? He got angry because... I don't remember. Tell me about it! - I don't remember! I got angry because mom scolds me. What are you screaming at me? What are you saying? With that angry face. - I didn't think about it. "A flower told me" performed by the first grade from the Anatole France school. I found in the night a paper flower Over the snow sleeping, so I give it warm The flower told me: Today is Christmas. Your tree has blossomed, today is Christmas. In Leo's school there's a lot of muslim people and that's a difficult subject for the teacher at this time of the year. Leo told me that the teacher explained what Christmas is. For muslims it's not Christmas, it's Laid. Then she explained each kid how it works for the other. This time of year is a puzzle for teachers. The french school is also secular, but Christmas is very invasive. Is very difficult. It makes the tensions between communities more difficult in school. It really is a special time. Hi! - How are you? How are you? - Very good! Hi Julia, hello Milo. - What's his name? He's Geronimo - And you? Mariana, come in. You get "Dulce de leche" there? We import it from Germany. Really? A friend ask it... They send it for orders over 80 euros. Then she said she was gonna make an order. No one eats this dessert! So we make this group with ten people and we order "dulce de leche". I will have a telephone in Finland. When? When I return home. I will get one for my birthday. And who is gonna give you one? - We are. She's already at an age she knows it's not a toy. Everyone knows it's not a toy! Many kids play with their phone. And how they handle phones in school? They are lot allowed to touch them. But they keep them? But are not allowed to touch them. And they obey? Yeah. I tried to call Julia once to tell her something. I tried calling a friend of hers during recess. Didn't know how the policy works. Since Julia doesn't have one. So I waited until recess and called. And the girl never responded. Then she called me in the afternoon and asked if I call her before. I say I did and she told me she couldn't use the phone in school. A lot of the kids that come home alone, you can see them talking to their parents. They say "I'm walking home now, I see a bike" and they narrate their entire journey home. So it's like when we were kids, but with phones. Sure, of course this are different times. Since when is school in Finland this way? It was always like this? When your parents went to school? It was different then. There were more schools in the country, towns were smaller. Then people started moving to the cities. All the country changed in the seventies. Yeah, in the seventies... even the diet changed. Everyone got focused and people asked "Where are we wanna go from here?" I think so, because in nutrition for example salads became very popular. They say "we are full of fat people, and we don't want to be fat." Because that brings problems. The state started the change. Like they said "Where are we standing and where do we want to go from here". They invested in research and say "let's go forward". At the same time they changed the way kitchens are organized. Houses itselves changed too. Yes, houses too. They got to research what's more functional. It was a process that starter after World War II. People grew up, and thought about their place in the world. They lost because they joined the other side since Russia invaded them. Yes. Russia was taking their territory. Then to recover from that, when they finally got rid of the weight of war then may be when it happened. It was an economic issue. Finland had to pay war reparations then when they finish paying. That's when they got the money to do... For example what you say about salads. In a country where vegetables for salad don't grow you need to plan it in with greenhouses. You can tell people to eat more salads. But the school give them. But they have to put lettuce in the supermarkets. Yes, all the infrastructure. I know they tested how many calories people eated. And it's the same government? The same political party? Now it changed. But they keep all that. Well they want to remove some things. But people oppose it. It's a socialist utopia, Finland is utopical. In the summer Agustina came to Buenos Aires. And we meet with her and her husband in our home. They told us about Finland's educational system and how it got to what it is today. It was something state driven that involved a lot of areas beyond education. The state wanted to improve the quality of life of the people of Finland. And I feel that both in France and Argentina, like in other countries, we see the opposite going on. And education won't escape this process. What you mean with opposite? In the sense that if you have a country that limits the rights of it's people that probably will affect public education system. I'm thinking about the riots I saw in Paris lately the protest about the new labor laws. - Yes. I see France as a place where the idea of a welfare state is culturally rooted. How does the people see this? We don't live well because they try to infringe the rights. And there's riots and demonstrations. Because the idea of a welfare state is still very strong in the french life. You know how this is. This is a neoliberal global process that's happening here too. That makes everyone question this model. Not only in the rights of the workers but also in other areas. But I don't think this affects education. I think education is still a stronghold. I don't think for example that budget cuts will affect it. I don't think so. To the water! Nooo! For example in France the budget in poor areas is higher. Leo is in a disadvantaged city, but in the best school, in the best place. But has less budget than other schools, because they want to compensate that. There's also a lot of love for public education. I don't feel that Leo is lacking in anything. He can make music inside his school and I love that. He's learning to play the horn, he choose that. He also learned chess. Things beyond formal education that I think are great. I don't feel anything is missing for him or that he's not having a quality education. It's an institution that holds up and for which we can feel proud of. Two questions I always ask myself when I think on parenting. What world am I leaving my kid? What son am I leaving to this world? Or better yet in plural: What world are we leaving to our children? And what children are we leaving to this world? When I think about those questions like that, in general. Is when my concerns about public education become more important to me. The question is, why is educational quality an issue now, when before it was not. Because I believe that our school systems have been better at incorporate more kids to distribute more titles and degrees, than developing people's knowledge. I went to the UBA, the Public University of Buenos Aires. Today I come back because of this documentary. I want to interview the professors from the Sociology of Education Class. Every government, no matter what political alignment they have have to respond to the demand of schooling. Families, towns, the countryside and small cities, all demand schools and education. "We want a high school in our town." And no politician can say no. No politician is gonna say: "I can't build you the high school because there's no teachers." "When I got teachers I will build you the school." In Latin America we have improvise the resources. We have expanded schools improvising buildings, that are not as big and important as the ones from the era of the "education for a few". Are cheap buildings often improvised in a parochial house. Or another physical location. We also improvise teachers. 23% of all teachers in the year 2000 said they started working before graduating. Even today there are lots of students that are incorporated without graduating first. Because there are spaces to be filled. You can't stop the demand for schooling. Government Palace, Presidency of the Nation. Is easier to bring schooling than developing knowledge. I would say that instead of the right to an education, that is the right to school our citizens. We should talk about a right to knowledge, to Math, Calculus. A right to an expressive competition, what are we using now. Ministry of Economy. The minister of economy and social development can distribute incomes and money. Like an universal assignment. Ministry of Health and Social Development. Can distribute houses, shoes, computers, books. Things can be distribute. And we sometimes talk without knowing and say stuff like distribute knowledge. Knowledge is developed, with a co production team. Is as important what the teacher and the school as what the family and children gives. Then you have to ask yourselves what conditions should families have so their kids be ready. For doing what only they can do for the learning experience to happen. Ministry of Education. Is very difficult to think you can teach like it was historically. How can a kid be in school if he has no access to healthcare for example. When a kid got sick they think its because he's not interested in school. And maybe they are sick three weeks, because in places with lots of pollution for example. There's tons of respiratory diseases. Then I think only the state have the tools to integrate this rights. The policies to serve this rights and promote situations of better life style. A policy that works towards the improvement of the teaching environment should strengthen their main characters. A while ago there was this project called "Teacher more teacher". That imply working in teaching couples, with trainers that went to the classrooms. And that helped develop the teachers in their environment. Watching the advances of the students. But it was too expensive. Is easier to do a standardized training with a bunch of content. Not knowing how they process that. Instead of a training that imply a more active discussion, and a following to what is done. We have to prove that like in other countries, the state is a good manager. We in Argentina can't we have a good manager? Why can't we have quality public school? We can work miracles, there's not enough six points of the GNP to have a good public school. It's not only a budget problem, but it is a budget problem. It's an issue of social investment. And we need to fight to increase the resources and at the same time reform the school system. It should be up to the challenge that schools face in this society. What do you want to be when you grow up? I want to be a space scientist and drummer. What was that idea of yours? I will send robots with instruments so they play music. I send them to the other side of a black hole so they play music. I send some to play music and others to take pictures. And why would you send robots to play music at space? Because... If there's an alien who likes music, it will approach them. And they will take it's picture and send it to me. So the music attract aliens? Yes. But how do robots know how to play music? I put it on a USB device.
