[MUSIC PLAYING] JASON (VOICE OVER): Captain Jason Harris personal log. Galactic Alliance Cargo Cruiser Prometheus reporting all systems are normal. Big surprise. Crews holding up under the stress of a deep space mission. But if I don't get these guys I'm shore leave soon, they might start shoring up the bulkheads. Get one last pickup and then we can hit a pleasure planet. Picking up a cargo from Credos 4. Now, the last I heard, Credos 4 was off limits to alliance ships. I guess we got special clearance. It's no matter, the crew's operating with the normal efficiency. Along with the human crew, we've been assigned a new droid. Part of the D-1000 series. Supposed to be the latest model for deep-space flight. I think it needs a little seasoning. It's been working on its programming. Status, Mr. Carter. Uh, looking good. Could you be a little bit more specific? Uh, we're on course and should be entering Credos airspace right on schedule. Fine. Any word from TJ about the engine overall? Um, yeah. I think he hasn't-- No, don't try and cover for him. I know exactly where he is. Well, you can go back to your technical reading. [SCI-FI HARMONICS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh. Is that the way it's going to be? I like it rough. Not tonight, little man. Oh, don't be shy. Tonight, Ulga only loves Ulga. Oh, Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] Show me those muscles. Turn around. Turn around. It's an interesting way for my chief engineer to dress. Look, I can spend my VR time any way I want to. Yeah, the key word here, TJ, is your time. Look, I need to blow off some steam. We've been out here a long time. Yeah, it's been a long trip for everyone. Now, you knew this was a deep space mission when you signed on. Now I need you to pull yourself together, get down to engineering. And I want that engine overhaul finished by the time we have to orbit. Where do you think we are, Captain? The Neptune space docks? Look, I'm one guy here trying to hold this damn rust bucket together with nothing but spit and wire. So I would expect-- Save your dramatics for a little Hungarian filly and stick to your engines. When did you become such a hard ass? Look, I got the alliance breathing down my throat about this mission. We're about to enter restricted airspace. I guess, I'm just a little bit anxious because I could really use some short leave too. That's all you had to say, Skip. Just get down to engineering. No problem. [SCI-FI HARMONICS] Begging your pardon, Captain Harris. Might you have a moment for a brief discussion? Well, sure, Dex. But, please, call me Jason. Alliance protocol clearly designates ranks and requires all subordinates to conduct themselves accordingly while in the presence of a superior officer. Dex, do me a favor. Yes, Captain? Lighten up. We're in deep space. The no admirals around. I won't stand for formality on my ship. Technically this is not your ship. It is owned by the Galactic Alliance. Thank you for reminding me, Dex. I'm designed to assist. [HYDRAULIC DOOR OPENING] What can I do for you, Dex? I've been performing the ship's diagnostics as you requested, Captain. And? There is great room for improvement. I found approximately 3,456 programs in need of upgrade. Another 1,366 programs that are no longer in use but taking available memory space. Is the ship or running, Dex? Running, sir? Yes, running. Is it operating? Yes, Captain. But not as efficiently as it should. Efficiently. All right, fine. Make the needed upgrades. I'm designed to assist. I didn't sign up to overhaul this rust bucket that should've been scrapped years ago. You know what I gotta do to keep this thing purring-- keep it running smooth? Sounds like you're talking about a woman. What do you know about women? Oh, I know plenty. And both of you spent so much time in the virtual chamber, it's no wonder either one of you knows how to handle a real woman. This coming from the guy who spends half his time with the Cleopatra program. How are things on the Nile there, Len? Hey, just fine. So, TJ, what do you do with all your credits when this mission's over? I got my eye on a Tantar farm. Tantars? Are you crazy? No, I know a trader that'll pay 1,000 credits ahead for those things. Yeah, if one of the Tantar's six fangs doesn't kill you first. No, no, no, no. Like I was saying, they're just like women. You've got to know how to handle them. Gentleman. Hey, Captain. Hey, Captain. TJ Was just telling us how you retired and raise Tantars. Tantars? Are you crazy? Give you a week before those things tear you to shreds. See. You guys don't know shit. COMPUTER: Attention. We're entering orbit. All right, gentlemen, let's move it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Dex, report the cargo bay one. Secure the transport. Aye, Captain. Will we be transporting down to the surface? Absolutely not. We're here to pick up cargo and that's it. Seems like such a shame to waste a trip to a forbidden planet. Keep your eyes on your console, Carter. Aye, Captain. Incoming transmission from the Alliance. Pipe it in. It's on a secure channel. What now? This is Captain Jason Harris, authorization alpha 2, voice scan verify. [BEEPING] Holy shit. What is it? Secured. Come on. That's the orders. Take the comm. The cargo is onboard and secure, sir. Well, Dex, you're uniquely qualified to stand guard here since you don't require sleep. I understand. Good. Now under no circumstances whatsoever is anybody to enter that area. Excuse me, Captain. But just who are we protecting this cargo from? It is not like the ship is full of crew or passengers. I have my orders. It would help if I knew what we were transporting, sir. You'll be provided information on a need-to-know basis. Aye, Captain. JASON (VOICE OVER): Captains Log. We're headed to a rendezvous with Nimmo 6, which is where we'll unload our mystery cargo. Just hope I can keep the crew from finding out what we're carrying. [MUSIC PLAYING] WOMEN: (WHISPERING) Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ALARM SOUNDING] [ELECTRICAL BURST] What the hell's going on? [EXPLOSION] Get to engineering, now. Go. What the hell is going on? We're under attack. I know that. By who? That's what we're trying to find out right now. [ENGINES ROARING] [LASER FIRE] Defense shields down 15%. power supplies draining, Captain. Switch to auxiliary. Scanning the alien vessel. There's no known configuration match-up in the alliance databank. Trying to open hailing frequencies. [EXPLOSION] Maybe they don't want to talk. Shields down another 30%, Captain. Return fire. [LASER FIRE] Direct had. No effect. Again. [LASER FIRE] Their shields are too strong. Captain, we're being hailed. Onscreen. Surrender or perish. You mind telling me what the hell you are. Surrender or perish. I don't like those options. Get him off, Dex. Something not right here. No kidding. Captain, I'm scanning their weapons systems. They're not even firing at full strength. A direct hit with our shields down-- Yeah, I get their picture, Dex. Options? We could try to outrun them. It's doubtful. There's always negotiation. I hate negotiations. Open a com-line. Captain Jason Harris of the Galactic Alliance Cargo Vessel Prometheus. We're not on a mission of destruction. We're simply transporting cargo from one star system to another. We want your cargo. That's unacceptable. Then prepare to die. [EXPLOSION] We're losing power. Our shields are collapsing. We can't take another hit. Open the comm channel. There might be time to discuss our terms of surrender. Captain? As you were, Ensign. Captain, we only want your cargo. Fine. You wanted that badly, you can have it. Prepare to transport. Yeah, well, give us a minute. Our transport system to shot the hell. We can't just give up like this. I'm not. Zip it. Dex, can you program a quantum torpedo to explode by remote? - Of course, Captain. - Do it. Hurry. Ready to receive your cargo. And then we'll be free to go? We have no need for your inferior species. Thank you. Ready, Dex? Yes, Captain. Here it comes. Now, Dex. This is not the cargo. Really? Bite me, asshole. [EXPLOSION] Yeah, baby. Did you see all of that? Dex, put it up, buddy. You did all right. The alien vessel has been destroyed, Captain. Don't celebrate too quickly. TJ? We're not going anywhere. What's the status? The status is bleak. The engines are shot and the hyperdrive's offline. Even if we could get things fixed, I got bulkheads buckling all over the ship. We go any faster than lightspeed and we'll fly apart. Great. And that's not all. Our fuel cells took a hit and they shorted out. Which means? Which means if we don't find any Triax crystals or recharge them, we're going to be floating out in space. How much power do we have? I don't know. I can rearrange things, play with a few subsystems. But I'm going to need a day, maybe two. Oh, that's just fantastic. We're stuck out the middle of nowhere with hostile aliens. Len, relax. It'll be fine. Look, Jason, you're the Captain. What are we going to do? I think I'll find some way for us to land. Hopefully, find some Triax crystals. Len, you help TJ get the systems back online. I'll get Dex to shore up the bulkheads. Sir, where will you be? I'm going to go find out what we almost just died for. [ENGINES ROARING] What is the status, Captain? It's not good. We need to set down. That is unfortunate. Yes, it is. Now, I need you to get to the bridge, find us a nearby planet or asteroid with Triax deposits. And make it quick. What? I'm sensing that your gregarious, good-natured humor is no longer presence, sir. Good sensors, Dex. Thank you, Captain. [BEEPING] We are here to serve you. Uh, yeah. Uh, ladies why don't you, uh-- why don't you come with me. I'll get you some better clothes and something to eat. This is the cargo we almost got toasted for? You knew they were on board and you didn't say anything. Well, I had my orders. Besides, I didn't trust any of you. Come on. Well, the three of you have been climbing up the walls on the ship. Three beautiful women beamed aboard our cargo bay, I think I made the right decision. Man, can they put it away. How long they've been in stasis? I don't know. I couldn't tell. And all they keep saying is, I'm here to serve you. We better find out what they're here for before they eat all our rations. Excuse me, ladies. I'm Captain Jason Harrison. I'm the commander of the ship. And we were wondering-- whoa. Whoa. Hey, hold on a minute. I'm here to serve you. Look, that's OK. You don't have to serve me. But I would like to know who you are? We're ambassadors from Credos. We're to join with the High Commander of the Galactic Alliance. That is you? No. That's not me. We were supposed to awaken when the High Council was ready to receive us as a gift. Well, unfortunately, you're a long way from any Alliance airspace. Uh, what do you mean gift? We're here to serve you and give you ultimate pleasure. DEENA: It is our mission. Our reason for being. Wait a second. I don't get it. Yeah, it sounds like some sort of an arranged marriage deal. With three wives? Yeah, well, who are we to question the wisdom of our High Command? Do you ladies want to be married? We are here to serve. We got that, but-- Look, let's find them some quarters. I'll put in a call to the Alliance and try to figure out what to do with them. In the meantime, let's get back to repairs on the ship. And, gentlemen, please, stay away from the ladies. That's an order. Now. Now, people. Let's move it. [ENGINES ROARING] Something's gone wrong. We shouldn't be awake. Will we fulfill our destiny? We must fulfill our destiny. But I'm afraid of these humans. Shh. We need to study them further. But never forget, we have the power over them. [MUSIC PLAYING] How are those repairs coming, Carter? OK. Got an incoming message from the Alliance. WOMAN (ON COMMLINK): To Prometheus, you are to carry out your mission and deliver the cargo to Star Base-12. Do not deviate and do not contaminate. Cargo? Do they even know we're carrying? They must. What are you going to do? Well, what can I do, Carter? I'm going to follow the orders. Well, you can't just turn them over to the Alliance. It's not my concern. But-- No, Carter, you have your repairs. Go back to them. Aye, aye, sir. Captain, I believe I have found a suitable planet for us to land on. It is only 12 lights from our present location. Inhabitants? Ionization in the upper atmosphere is interfering with our sensors. But are there Triax deposits? Apparently so. Well, that's all we need. We won't be staying long. Set in a course. Aye, Captain. Rust bucket. You should have been melted for scrap a time ago. You're TJ? Ouch! Owe, oh. I am Deena. Let me soothe you. How did you do that? Our people have certain empathic gifts. We sense what people need and strive to fulfill that. What do I need right now? Whoa. Whoa. So this is where it all happens? Oh, hey. You are Carter. And I am Junet. Nice to meet you. So will you show me how you fly this ship? Well, sure. I went through a lot of years of training at the Academy of course. Well, I guess it's really not that difficult to fly this thing. Oh, boy. These are where you, uh, put the coordinates in and, yeah, this is-- these are the helm controls and they control the, uh-- the, uh-- The helm? Yes, the helm. Right. Fascinating. Mm-hmm. You must be very smart to control all this. No. No, I'm-- well, yes, I guess I am. I love being in the company of a smart man. Really? You ever get over to my part of the galaxy? [MUSIC PLAYING] Show me more controls. Anything you want. You are, Dex? I'm Reva. Pleased to make your acquaintance. Do you mind if I watch you work? Whenever you desire. What do you desire, Dex? I have no desires. Everyone has desires. Everyone with emotions. I'm not like everyone. Oh, you're-- uh, you mean, you're alone in the universe. Well, I understand how you feel. Actually, I'm one of 2,349 models of the D-1000 fully automated android units. Fully automated? Fully. So you mean that your body is the same as a human males? I do not require sleep or sustenance like humans. Otherwise, I'm anatomically correct. Perfect. [CHIMES] Is there something you wish from me? [CHIMES] I don't understand. Most men desire our kisses. It's like I said, I'm not like most men. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLEARS THROAT] Hello. You are Jason. I am Junet. That's very nice. Uh, Carter, what's your status? My status? Yes, how are your repairs coming along? Uh, pretty good. Pretty good. You know something, Junet, I think you should let Mr. Carter finish his work. As you wish. Back to work, Mr. Carter. Right, work. TJ, how's it going? Swell. Swell? Yeah, swell. All right, listen, we're going to be landing in about four hours. How long until the hyperdrive is ready? Well, that's tough to gauge. Try. I just don't know. I'll tell you what, TJ. When you do know, fill me in. OK? You'll be the first. Can I help you with that? What are you doing here? We have some unfinished business. You mean, like, showing you the rest of the ship? No. Like showing you this. Do you approve? Are you kidding? [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Carter. Sorry. Well, if you're not too busy, do you think you might be able to take us into orbit? Set the ship down, please? Sure. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINES ROARING] All right, people, let's spread out and find that Triax ore. I don't want to stay here long. Let's go, people, now. You shouldn't scold them, they're only human. Yeah, well, I'm beginning to think of the three of you as nothing more than distractions. Is that good? No, it's not. We need to get off this planet and get out of this quadrant before there's lizards come back. Lizards? Yeah, the aliens are practically destroyed my ship looking for the three of you. Mutarbians. Mutarbians? Yeah, well, whoever the hell they are, I don't want to be here when their friends come looking for them. The Mutarbians and my people have been warring for centuries. I got no intention of getting into the middle of an intergalactic war. My orders are to take the three of your Star Base-12 as quickly as possible. Why is it so important for us to be taken there? I don't know. But I intend to keep my orders. Hmm. You're so strong. So forceful. I can see why you are the Captain. Yeah, lucky me. Well, you take charge so well. What are you doing? I'm scared. Look, there's no reason to be scared. We'll get you to safety. I feel safe just being close to you. Stop it. What are you doing? Giving you what you want. I can sense your needs. It's my desire to fulfill them. Look, thank you. But I've got other things on my mind. Don't. Stop. Are you one of those androids? Excuse me. I'm tired of looking for Triax. Hello, Len. What are you doing sneaking up on me like that? If I've disturbed you, I'm sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING] Perhaps, I could sooth you? I take it that is Triax? Yeah. I'll get processed right away. I can perform that task, if you wish. Uh, no thank you, Dex. I need the distraction. Shall I continue to watch the women, sir? Yeah, please. You're the only one I trust to do it. Uh, listen, do me a favor. Check the Alliance databanks and find out any information you can on Credos 4 and why it's banned. I believe those files require a security code level of alpha 1, Captain. I'm only beta 1. Use this. This is your security clearance, Captain. Dex, this is an emergency and I need that information. I will follow your orders, Captain. But I would like my objections noted in the logs. Fine. Careful, ladies, you might get burned by the sun. They, um, might need some protection. I've got just the thing. Allow me. Oh, and me. [MUSIC PLAYING] I do not think you will find Triax looking there. [BEEPING] [HYDRAULIC DOOR OPENS] Cindy, I'm home. [APPLAUSE] Hello, honey. How was your day at the office? Long. AUDIENCE: Aw. Come and tell Cindy your troubles. Where do I begin? [LAUGHTER] You are so tight. Like steel knots. You need to loosen up. Yeah, right. Whelp, my ship is shot to hell, landed on a planet and I don't know if we're ever going to be able to take off again. We've got three alien women disrupting my crew. [LAUGHTER] But I'll get over it. Hmm. I think I can help you get over it. You think? I think. [CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] AUDIENCE: Oh. OK, try it now. Still no good. Damn it. All right, I'll try rerouting the primary systems. Yo, T. Listen, Jason, you really need to rethink bringing the women to the Alliance. I agree. You have any idea what they'd be forced to do? It's not your concern. Oh, it is. I think I'm in love. Me too. You know what? You have got to be kidding me. This is just like the space whores on Reitran. I mean, both you fell head over heels. I couldn't even get you back to the ship. Then when you come down with a really bad case of Reishan Warts, I couldn't get you out of here quick enough. It's not like that. It's exactly like that. Now, I don't want to hear another word about these women. Get back to work. Captain, I was able to access those files you requested. Spill it, Dex. Spill it, sir? What did you find? It seems as though the women of Credos 4 have a very unique place in the hierarchy of society. They are genetically empathic. What do you mean? They can read minds? Not so much read minds as sense feelings. With this ability, they are able to compensate the males of other species with pleasurable acts. So then why are they off limits? It seems as though once you have exchange functions with the women of Credos 4, you are bonded to them for life. Now, the men of Credos have learned to suppress their natural instincts, but other species are very susceptible to the women's powers. No wonder the Alliance wants us to stay away from them. The Alliance is planning on giving the Credos women as gifts to the Hushin ambassadors. Hushins? When did we get into bed with the Hushins? We did not get into bed with them, Captain. But apparently, our cargo will. The Alliance feels this gesture of goodwill assures peaceful negotiations with the Hushins. Yeah, because they'll be so doped up in love with their new wives the Alliance will roll right over them. The Hushins have been relentless, Captain, in their pursuit of new territory. Yeah, I know. Regardless, I don't like playing dirty. Playing dirty, sir? Never mind. Just keep this information to yourself. Aye, Captain. So where have you been all my life? On my planet. What the hell are you doing? Getting acquainted with Deena. Punk bastard. JASON: Knock it off. I do not think fighting are in the regulations. What the hell is going on here? He was messing With my woman. You don't own her. You son of a bitch. Yeah, all right. Fine. From now on, the two you work on opposite ends of the ship. As for you and your friends, you stay the hell away from my crew. Now, I don't need this now. We gotta get this ship fixed and get out of this quadrant as quickly as we can. Now take them the hell back to the ship. Yes, Captain. I have some very disturbing news. What? We're to be offered up as brides to the ambassador to a race known as the Hushins. How do you know? I've tapped into the captain's logs. But why? It's all part of the wishes of the High Council and Credos. They wish to open up our planet to the Alliance. But what will become of us? How will we fulfill our destiny? JUNET: Suppose-- Yes? Suppose we don't want to. Go against the High Council? I don't want to marry an alien. I like it here with these humans. As do I. But this is not our destiny. We can't change how we feel. Maybe we should have never left Credos. Perhaps we need a change in plans. Mind if I join you? Suit yourself. You know, as much as I enjoy space travel, there's nothing more beautiful than hanging out in nature. If I didn't know better, Captain, I'd swear you were getting personal with me. Well, I better watch what I say. It won't happen again. I, uh-- I know why we're being taken to your star base. We're to become brides of the Hushin ambassador. What did you do? Did read my mind? In a way. I guess I have to watch what I think. What would happen if we didn't want to go? It's not up to me. Who's it up to? The Alliance, I guess. Will you tell them? [SIGHS] I-- I don't think that they'll listen to me. I mean, once we get off the planet, you can communicate with them. Will they honor our wishes and allow us to return home? I don't know. Yes, you do. [MUSIC PLAYING] DEENA: Carter. Carter. I miss you, Carter. I need you in my arms. JUNET: TJ. Come to me, TJ. TJ, I need you. DEENA: Len. Len, where are you? Why don't you come to me? Len? What are you doing here? Same thing you are. Look, she wants me. Hey, let's just see then. You're a punk. You better stay the hell away from her and get out of my way. Knock it off people. What the hell is going on here? You can't keep them away from us all the time. The hell I can't, TJ. What's gotten into you? Ever since you took your command you become a real dick. Oh, that's just great, Carter. I'll let that one go because I know you're out of your mind. You three obviously don't see what these women are doing to you. Look, you should try it. Maybe you wouldn't be such a hard ass. Yeah, well, thanks to me we can now get out of the quadrant. And I suggest we do it now. The engines are back online. Prepare for takeoff. Now, people. Let's move it. [MUSIC PLAYING] Carter, set us a course for Star Base-12. Yes, sir. Prepare for hyperdrive. On your command. Engage. I said engage, Carter. I did engage and nothing happened. What do you mean nothing happened? Captain, systems have been rerouted to engineering. TJ. TJ, what the hell is going on down there? Damn it. I'm going down. There is an additional problem, Captain. Sensors indicate a ship entering this section. Configuration? [TONE] Mutarbian. CARTER: Oh, we're screwed. Not yet. Dex, you come with me. Carter, you get ready to punch us out of a star system. Heck yeah. TJ, what the hell is going on? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. But the women have taken control of the ship. Well, how the hell did that happen? Well, I don't know. Junet came in and we just started talking. And the next thing I knew I got hit on the head and blown out. They have locked out the security codes for the door, Captain. Well, override it. Attempting. I guess they did more than kiss. [EXPLOSION] [ALARM] They're back and they're really pissed. Jason, you better get back up here. Try to get the ship back, Carter. Dex? Very sophisticated programming, Captain. [EXPLOSION] Dex, would you open the damn door before there's nothing left off the ship. Yes, Captain. JASON: Step away from the console. You don't understand. Now. Carter, get us the hell out of here. I'm on it. The Mutarbians are not following, Captain. They never leave their own space. Now, would you mind explaining to me why you tried to hijack my ship? We did what we had to do. Yeah, well, congratulations, ladies. You almost got away with it. JUNET: Can't you help us? There must be a way. Help you? You brainwash my crew. You sabotaged half my systems. You've almost gotten us killed. Why should I help you? We don't want to go to the Alliance. We don't want to be slaves. All right, people, I've heard all your arguments. Look, the final word here is that we don't have any choice. The Alliance is expecting us to deliver this cargo. And if they don't get it, they won't stop until they do. You just can't give up that easily. Well, I'm open to suggestions. We make a run for it. Hang out there Mutari nebula until things blow over. TJ, that is the first place that they'll look. You know, maybe there can be some sort of hologram we can set up to fool them. It won't last long enough. Look, I'm sorry, ladies. We don't have any choice. We have to deliver you. What if you deliver the cargo but it wasn't us? Well, what would it be? Clones. Clones? Yes, exact duplicates of us. No, absolutely not. TJ: Yeah, clones. No. The Alliance outlawed cloning over a century ago. You know that. Jesus, we could caught with clones, they'll have us vaporized. So we won't get caught. No. It's not going to happen. Besides, we don't even have the technology. We do. Excuse me? Our people clonal the time. It's not that complicated. We can easily reconfigure your systems to accommodate the process. And with the acceleration code, we can have the clones ready in time to reach the destination. It would save us. Look, I'm sorry, ladies. I just-- I can't. I respect your decision. I know now that it was wrong for us to try and take over your ship. We were born to this duty and we will honor it. Don't look at me like that. All systems operating within normal parameters, Captain. Looks, like, you're the only one on board is still talking to me, Dex. What would you like to talk about? Nothing. Is there something interfering with the efficiency of this ship? No. Only the person commanding it. Dex, let me ask you something. If you knew that you were doing something fundamentally good but it meant breaking the law, would you do it anyway? If I'm to understand your hypothesis, you feel though there are circumstances which place certain needs above the law. Right. Then why have laws? Because without them, there would be chaos. I think you just answered your own question. Maintain the comm. Aye, Captain. [BEEPING] [HYDRAULIC DOOR OPENS] Cindy. What are you doing here? I didn't program you. TJ entered our likeness into the virtual matrix. Shall I pose for you? [SIGHS] What the hell. [MUSIC PLAYING] You're real, aren't you? I'm afraid so. But why? I wanted to be with you. I couldn't think of any other way. [MUSIC PLAYING] So does this mean that we've bonded. No, it doesn't. I don't understand. There's a secret to our pleasures. We choose who we want to bond with. Really? Hm. So then even if we had given you to the Hushins, it wouldn't have done the Alliance any good, would it? No, it wouldn't. Wow. I should go now. And where are you going to go? We've got some cloning to do. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HUMMING] Wow. Can we make just one more batch? [MUSIC PLAYING] Standby for docking tractor beam. Tractor beam engaged. [ENGINES ROARING] Captain Harrison coming orders. Thank you. Please inform Ambassador Galen I'll report to him with the cargo immediately. AMBASSADOR GALEN: That won't be necessary. Ambassador Galen. Welcome aboard, sir. I would have prepared the crew. Nonsense. I couldn't wait to meet my cargo. I just had to be aboard right away. This way, sir. Captain Harris, I'd like you to meet Deena, Reva, and Junet. Girls, Captain Harris. We are here to serve you. No girls. I'm the one to serve. No, I mean, I'm the one you are to go with. Ambassador. Ambassador? Yes? Well, I'll take charge of the cargo. See to their indoctrination, inoculation, and so forth. Yeah, I bet you will. How's that? Nothing, sir. Are you and your companions are ready? We are. Very well. Let's get started. Ah, my child. Miss me? You know, I can't believe this is actually going to work. [GIGGLES] [BEEP] Go ahead, Dex. [TONE] Attention, crew. New orders from Alliance Headquarters effective immediately. Galactic Alliance Cargo Vessel Prometheus will proceed to Turner outpost in the gamma quadrant for transport of Crantrix grain. Crantrix? Wheat. For the Veledians. It's all they eat. And it only grows on one plant. And it's on the other side of the universe. So it looks like we'll be stuck together for a long time. Set a course for deep space, Dex. Aye, Captain. Humans. [MUSIC PLAYING]
