Also, I hate guys who approach a girl in a gang of three. Anything else, brother? -No, we are done. Okay, tell me. I bought all this. But she thinks brands are useless. I think she likes boys who drive tractor. She doesn't like you. I suggest you to wear Kurtas in college. All of these things are useless for you now. This is also useless for you.

Forget about grandma. What did Manraj's family say? Manraj's family is finding her a groom. They said they will immediately get her.. Married if they will find a good proposal. But your family said their son is studying. As if you are in first grade, and that old man will teach you. Yes. Greetings, Bebe. My son is home. -Ho, mom. -Hi. Father, why are you sleeping in a day? What? Why are you here? Bebe, I have observed, no one asks about education. I left it. What do we have here? Only soil, plants, mud and dung. Don't you realize your responsibilities? Listen to me. Turn around and go back right now. Bebe, who will cultivate this land.. ..if everyone will find a job? Do you know it is difficult to get through competitive exams? Bebe, population is growing fast. Educated guys need to do farming.. ..for the progress of the country. They will die of hunger. I don't know. I want to do farming. You don't want to go back. Fine. Help country to do progress. Give these bike keys to me. Come on. Tractor is there. Go to the farms and water plants. You will know how it is done. Mother, let him have some water. -He will drink it later. Go and have water there. I know he can't. Get up. Go there. Dare you threaten me of getting me married. I will leave my studies and get married. You can get me married today itself. I am not scared. Who mentioned about your marriage? I thought she must be thinking about it. -Look at him. Are you a mind reader to read my mind? Keep quiet! What's wrong with him? Get up. You sleep all day and keep walking everywhere all night. Sit during the day. When did you start taking dagger to College. As if you want a sickle to cut your aunt's crop. I really feel like that. Rama, have you ever fallen in love? Poor people don't fall in love. Our lives are struggle. We don't get everything. I never got time to fall in love. I thought to share it with you.

Your family is not ready. -They will agree. Don't worry. 'Your grandma won't be ready.' -We will return in two days. 'Okay, fine.' Okay. Okay. Fine. Brother, you love a girl. Show me her photo. Do you want one? -No. -Go and check water. Get up, Nathuram. Why is he digging a hole here? Hello. Greetings. -Yes. Greetings. -I heard you have a boy, eligible to marry. I don't know. Ask her. Why have you given her the authority? You are here again! -Greetings! I thought to try one more time. I thought to check if he is eligible now. I have got a rich proposal this time. I hate it. Our son left his studies incomplete and came back. Thank God that I am getting good proposals for your son. You still want him to get married. I don't know what he is doing there. Why do we want him to get married? Okay, fine. Listen to me. I have a nephew. He left his college. He is forty two years old. Find him a partner. His wife passed away. No, Bebe. I don't take second hand piece. I deal with fresh pieces. Leave now. He wants to deal with fresh pieces. What are you looking at? Bebe, that's what I do. I think, she is eligible to marry. Yes, will you find her one? No, I was checking her out for myself. What? -You liked her. Don't propose her. I will kill you. Bebe, I don't know what you eat but you always speak bitter. Don't bother. I will slap you. Leave. -You never spare me. Nikka. -What did they say? Bad! She is after my life. She doesn't get convinced. Brother, we have to convince Bebe any how. Brother, my grandma used to say that her husband was bad. He married to a younger girl. Because of you, he will tease the womenfolk. "I am dying for you." Hey Chotu, come out. -Yes. I won't come out. You will pull down my pants. I won't. Come out. Listen to him. Sardars never lie. I will get you a new one next year. Come out, my son. Come on. You will approach bebe. I won't go. Your grandma shoots at sight. She doesn't consider anyone's age. What nonsense? -This is true. Will you have a Frooti? -Yes. See he wants Frooti. Bebe, is brother home? He is gone to the farms. Why do you want him? Shanti sent a letter for brother. Shanti wrote a letter! Give it to me. No, I will give it to brother. Will you give it to me or not? Come on. Read it for me. Nikka baby, I can't tell you how happy I am. Ranjha left his job for me and you left your college. I keep visiting your house with an excuse to get buttermilk. I don't want to live away from you. I see you in bits and that makes my day. Tell me the colors of turban you have, I will dye my scarfs. Your love, Shanti. What is this? Shanti crossed an arrow on brother's heart. No! He is gone out of control. Now I realized why she comes here often. You will get all the letters to me. You know that I don't consider anyone's age. Go now. He is becoming a postman. "Om Shanti Om!" (Make Peace). Bebe, I finished all the work peacefully today. I did it. I know all your work. Bapu, why are you calm? What's the matter? Let me see how he sits peacefully. I gave him work to do. Bebe, isn't it good to maintain Shanti (peace) at home? I know what you are up to outside this house. Hit it now. This old man will die with one hit of a glass. What kind of son you have? Your only son is behind girls. Mother, you asked us to stop after having a son. Don't back answer me. You are proud. You argue with me. Didn't you see what he did? Bebe, I have decided to maintain peace at home. Be careful. Don't hit me. -He wants Shanti at home! He was a man of words. He really stopped stalking you. This color suits you. Well he is not a completely crazy. When did I say he is crazy? He is good! Were you just throwing tantrums? You know my family. They don't allow love marriage. Why should we do something that no one will accept? Bebe, how are you? -Get back. Mind your business. She just tries to please me. She acts innocent. You should have some shame before acting innocent with me. Bebe, he didn't abuse your maternal house. Why are you after him, for no reason? She has such soft hands. Shanti, don't you worry about Bebe. You know how she is. Go and get you buttermilk. No big deal. Okay. -This is your house too. I am warning you to leave from here. I have an axe. Do you want me to hit you with it? 'Whenever the world will try to separate two lovers..' 'Their love will grow..'. -You! Sher, how are you? Sardar, I am fine. -Brother, please go. I want one more. Give him one more. Go now. Will you be seated here? Letter for a girl! What did you forget here? I forgot the straw. -World is getting worse. Shanti is very different. I know, Shanti is very good. Nikka my baby, that old lady misbehaved with me. I don't think she will agree. You were right. Make a plan for Shimla. We will get married and break her pride. Your loving, Shanti. Hey you! Yes, Bebe. -Come here. Yes, Bebe. -Come fast. Yes. -We are in trouble. Call the matchmaker. We have to get him married before he finds someone. Okay, Bebe. -Go. Listen to me. Don't tease me. Can't you go? Bebe, I wanted to say.. -Okay. Is water hot? -Very hot. In summer, he feels cold. Give it. Have some tea and snacks. I will ask her to call our boy. My son is studying in final year. Okay. But he doesn't believe in farming. He earned a lot but didn't spend. One has to go to the doctor if one is not feeling well. Brother, she is over-smart. Family looks nice. They have good property. Right? Our daughter will be fine here. Is she your daughter? No. I am a bachelor. -What? I mean, he is unmarried. She is my sister. Father had some work so he couldn't be here. Okay. I also have a nephew. He stayed unmarried. They are useless. No, that's not the matter. I am fine. Don't get upset but you look old. Looking for a fair girl. You said they are nice people but I don't agree with you. You said 38. Are you exaggerating the numbers? "Don't be arrogant." -The boy is here. Greetings. -Greetings. -Hello. Bebe, what's the matter? Are they here for business? We don't want to sell anything. Son, they are here with a proposal for you. He is the guy. He is right here. I didn't lie about him. You heard him right now. You can count the fingers. He has all of them. You can see him. Show us the girl's photo. No, Bebe. Does it look good to see her photo like this? They are nice. Girl must also be nice like them. There are only two complexions. Fair and dark. I don't have an issue with it. Elders can decide it further. Okay. -Great! Nice! Son, take this token of love. Mother, we choose you son. The last thing that he said just impressed me. You can take your decision but we liked this guy. Right. -He said it right. We will also come there with token of love. Okay. -Fine. -We can fix Wednesday for it. Sure. -That's fine. -As you wish. Congratulations to you. -Congratulations. Okay, see you. -See you. Where are you going? Listen to me. Sit here with me. You are very young. No problem. You had enough fun in life. It is better to marry the girl that.. ..your family choose for you. Listen, don't back out. I won't. You won't! -Promise. I love my grandson! This was Nikka and his love story. I loved honestly but I won it because of my smartness. Let's see what he does. "You will thank God everyday for having a partner like me." "Once you will spend time with me, you will be happy." "I will fulfill all your demands." "I will get you a mini cooper and we will go for a ride." "I will get you a mini cooper and we will go for a ride." "You can go shopping, I will give you my credit card to you." "I will treat you like my queen. I will guard you." "I will guard you."

"I will get you a mini cooper and we will go for a ride." "I will get you a mini cooper and we will go for a ride." "You're a perfect fit for my family." "Impress Bebe with you work." "You are my Sardarni. Nikka Zaildar loves you." "Zaildar loves you." "You're a perfect fit for my family." "Impress Bebe with you work." "You are my Sardarni. Nikka Zaildar loves you." "I am a man of words, as pure as 24 carat gold." "I will get you a mini cooper and we will go for a ride." "I will get you a mini cooper and we will go for a ride." "I will get you a mini cooper and we will go for a ride." "I will get you a mini cooper and we will go for a ride." Leave me. Brother, leave me. -Leave him. You are strangling me. -We reached their home. Get up. -Have some shame. We are glad. How are you? We are fine. -He is always fine. He is the landlord of our village but he doesn't step out. Of course! But he must be very handsome in young age. He got weak with his age. Greetings. -Greetings, my child. You! -Greetings. Do you know each other? Yes, brother. He studied in my college. That's great! You know each other. That's God's magic touch. Come on, sit with me. You go there. Go. -Okay. -Come here, dear. Come on. Come on. -Here is the bride now. Bebe, who is she? -She is my sister. Seerat. You are supposed to marry her. Oh, I see! I thought, she is the girl. No, aunt. She is the younger one. She is studying. We want Balwinder's daughter to get married. Bebe, I won't marry her. You will have to marry her. What's wrong with her? She is a nice girl. I told you but you refused to see her photo. There are only two complexions. Fair and dark. What did he say? Nothing, he asked me to hurry up. Give her token before tea. Good. -Good. Oh no! Take. Click a photograph. You are eager to get popcorn and he is in a big mess now. No problem! Enjoy it. Father. I don't want to marry. Father, I won't marry, come what may. Stop the car. -Do you feel nausea? Bebe! Bebe, Nikka says he doesn't want to marry. Don't tell me. I knew this already. He loves Shanti. Don't discuss this here. Let's go home and see. Okay, Bebe. He can marry Shanti. Doesn't matter. You are a fool! When will you be a little wise? Your son! See what he is up to. This old man is useless. Your father is a fool. -Sorry, man! So you complained? Well, that was good. I knew it. -Let's go. What are you waiting for? Strange! He chased me and ended up with my sister. Manraj, how is he? Fine. -Fine! Marry him if you like him. This is a limit. What happened? -Leave it. God knows what you want. How can one be this unsure? Silly. Why am I thinking about it? Why are you keeping it here? Where is the spray? I want it. Drink it. Come on. Hurry up. We don't have time to waste. Drink it. Come on. Did we raise you to go through this? I don't understand what she taught you? Mother, what's my fault? -You answered me again. Manner-less. Keep quiet. Go, get me some tea. I have headache. You have a headache! You useless man! You want to have tea. I didn't even drink water. Drink it. Drink it. Why did you ask for it? He talks nonsense. Fine. I will leave. -Where? -I got a call from father. Call your father here. You won't go from here until he agrees. Come on, keep it back. He is acting smart with me. You will marry their daughter. Bebe, I thought something else. It's not the matter. I know what you are thinking about. Bebe, you know nothing. Let me tell you. You go inside. I will speak to her. Bebe, when the car tyre is new, it keeps jumping. I don't want to put 5 grams golden bracelet. I understand everything. -Not 5, but 32. I will give ring of just half a gram. You can convince him later. Remember one thing. You will see the worse side of me if you won't convince him. Right. What are you doing? I am trying to convince you whole day. Your grandmother's threatening just scare me. Now you started acting weird. Behave yourself. You are getting married. It is not as easy as shopping. You cannot choose like this. You acted like a fool. Couldn't you see her photo first? You should have seen it. I am not in this business since ages. I got into this trap for a mobile. I don't want any apple phone. I am fine with Nokia. We have to do something. I don't want her. You have decided what you want. You won't change you mind. But it is about their reputation. What if the girl would reject me? Yeah! That's right. Do on one thing. Call her. Act a little weird. Take her for a coffee. Do anything you want. But please get me out of this. Oh Lord, please bless my grandson with a little wisdom. I pray him to get married to this girl. Where are you going? I am going to meet my wife. What? -I am going to meet my would-be wife. That wasn't enough! Did you hear him? No! Your father never met your mother before marriage. What about what I am going through? Tell me. What nonsense? I won't marry. Stop this nonsense. I think you are falling sick. Go. What is this? I said nothing to you. I gave a flying kiss to my would-be wife. Go now. Shanti. Shanti. -Is Bebe standing there? Yes. She is there. See what went in my eyes. Show me. -Oh my God! Nothing. -Nothing! Nothing. Fine. -No. Fine. Hello, Bebe. What happened? There was a problem in your house last night. You are responsible for it. You act innocent. Even evil spirits spare their loved ones. Why did you choose us to trouble? Shanti, get your buttermilk. Come on. Yes. Give her. She is trying to capture your house. Why are you scolding me? It is okay if you don't.. Want to give me sweets for Nikka's engagement. Listen to her! She is shameless. I saw her now with Nikka. This generation is completely ruined. Hey, wait. Why is she angry? What happened to her? -I don't know. Take it. I have added butter too. -Come down quickly. Yes. Yes. You have to secretly keep an eye on Shanti. Bebe, I will do it if you order me. I am giving you a responsibility. Don't create a mess. You have to keep an eye on Shanti. We won't get to catch them if they will leave together. Okay, Bebe. Yes, sir. Okay. Get us two tea quickly. Okay, sir. Listen, get two 'Mathiyas' as well. Sir, sorry we don't have 'Mathiyas'. -Okay, get tea. I don't know manners. This is my first time on a date. Sorry, sir. Sorry. No problem. It's just water. Yes. It's just water. Now that we are getting married. It's better to spend time. I can sleep only when I drink 3-4 pegs. No problem. Even I like Vodka. I eat only chicken. Did you try a lobster? Crab? I love fish. I don't like these suits. You will have to wear jeans. This! Who will wear these? I will wear shorts. Here is you son! Here you are! You got late. What happened, sir? Did you meet her? She drinks alcohol. So what? His mother used to drink. Do you know what she said to me? Bebe, she wears these small clothes. I mean this length. She said she won't wear suits. She feels hot in full clothes. Both of you wear suits. You feel okay. Forget about us. You need to change with the times. So what? She will keep everyone in the village entertained. Bebe, have some shame. Bapu, you sit like a rock all day. Say something. Have your food. -I don't want it. He must have eaten something. He rebukes. I am washing his clothes here. Hey, Bhola! She is a bomb! She is a firecracker. She is too much. She stayed in Chandigarh in individual flat. There is no issue if she returns at midnight. She is utilizing her father's money completely. As if we earn a lot, and send our salaries home. Bhole, you like many people. You can try. Maybe you will get her. Really? -That's not the issue. She is pretty. Do one thing. Get me a room here on the terrace. Your grandma taunts me every time I step downstairs. You want me to become like your grandfather. Your grandfather has turned into a.. ..tiny man because of her scolding. I am sure, your grandma must be like her in her younger days. Right. Why did I get into this? You can't do this small thing for me. What nonsense? You don't have the courage to tell the truth. You live with this sad feeling all the time. -What do I do? Even I love Neeru Bajwa. But it will be fun if Neeru Bajwa will love me back. That's right. Let me talk to Manraj first. I will manage the rest. Bebe. Bebe, did you work in films before? -Why? I saw a film in the night. There was a rude Gulabo aunt in it. She was just like you. -Did I hire you to watch films? Hey Mejara.. -Yes. Yes, Bebe. -You fool! Your father is went behind her. Oh! Bebe, my father is here. You are a big fool! Do you know where they are? I think, he went nearby. -You know everything. You are a biggest fool! I beg of you, make this marriage happen. Otherwise I will shoot you first and kill myself. I am Mahdeep Kaur. I cannot tolerate my insult. He is a shameless boy. How can he follow girls like this? Give this to me. Help me get up. You will expect me to carry you. Come on, stand up. Let me go. Uncle! What's he doing here? Uncle, what's the matter? -Nothing. Okay! Child, have patience. We cannot change our destiny. What's wrong with uncle? Yes! Welcome! Greetings. -Greetings. Someone get tea. Son-in-law is here. I was going to the college so I thought to pick up Manraj. Why would she struggle to get in a crowded bus? Uncle, I will be fine in the bus. Dear, it is okay. He is family now. He is our son-in-law. Yes. You know how boys are these days. They stalk girls like fools. Come on. You will get late and miss the class otherwise. Yes, Manraj. Go with him. Yes, he is fine. Manraj, go with him. Yes, she is sitting. I don't know if she is fair or dark. I am the only son. No siblings. Many girls are weeping, as I am after you. What do I lack? You're my would-be brother-in-law. Don't talk nonsense. I have sworn, I won't marry your sister ever. I will see what you can do. I will harass her for the dowry, and she will run away. Change my name if I won't break legs.. ..of boys who'll approach you. Stop this motorcycle. I said stop. What do you think of yourself? Don't we have any respect? My sister is fool and you think you are wise! I was joking. Did priest tell you to send a proposal to my house? Oh well no! Bhola is like a priest. I made this scheme. Stop this drama. Not everything is funny. What will my sister think if you.. ..will call off this engagement? What about our reputation in our village? I beg of you, don't make this mistake. Not everything will happen as per your expectations. You are making a history. You would be the first lover to marry his lover's sister. Then you will keep singing, my lover is my sister-in-law. Stop this nonsense. I am trying to break this alliance. She doesn't want to talk to me. But I love her honestly. I will teach you a lesson of true love. What do you think? Sleep, the villain is here. What nonsense! Oh Lord! Why are you up? I wanted to go to the washroom. -Can't you wait till morning? If you will fall down.. ..will I look after these boys or serve you? Sleep. Old one doesn't die and younger one has no peace. Hey, brother! How are you, Chotu.? -Fine. Where is aunt? -Sleeping at your girl's house. Where is she? -She is going to the college. I will give you chocolates later. I think he has lost his mind. Yes. -Manraj. Manraj, bus is here. Wait a minute. -Is there anyone for Sherpur? He has bad timing. Come on, Be quick. Manraj, listen. -I won't fall in your trap. I am a modern girl. I am also a modern guy. I am not from Stone Age. Listen to me as my sister-in-law. Count one minute. I got bored in computer lecture. -Yes, me too. Oh yes, I had to get suits from the market. Let's go. -Sure. Rickshaw! -Stop. Get on. Take us to the market. Stop this rickshaw. I won't pay. Brother, I will pay you as much as you want. Don't stop. Stop this rickshaw. -Please listen to me once. Please get off. Why are you embarrassing me? Someone will see us. Everyone looks at the perfect couple. We look good together. Why do you worry about people when.. ..a handsome guy is next to you? You can hit me. I might've chosen a wrong way but my love is true. I know I should have convinced you before sending a proposal. We get one life. This rose has no thorns. Regular rose has a lot of thorns. Please take it. -At least touch it if you don't want to keep it. Okay, stop this rickshaw. Brother, stop here. Keep this. Whether you agree or not.. I will get married to you, not cut ribbon. Take her. What are you doing? Nothing. -Have it. -No. Seerat, don't you really like that guy? It is not about liking him. Is this the way to get married? Family members are doing what they want. There should be a guy who will follow.. ..you on his bike to woo you. He should fight with other boys for you. You should be his priority. He should love you. We'll have to live in the kitchen if we will listen to elders. Bring lentils. Bring flat-breads. That would be our future. Let's go. -You go. 'This rose has no thorns. Regular rose has a lot of thorns.' 'Please take it. At least touch it if you don't want to keep it.' Hello. -'Manraj here.' Who Manraj? -'Manraj!' Yes. Yes. 'I want to talk to you. Can you meet me?' Okay. I will be there in five minutes. Bhola, give me some water. Flood! Flood! -Oh! Dare you do this again! I will complain to your grandma. All of this is not right. Oh, as if whatever is fixed is absolutely right! What do I do with your sister? Then what? -You know. If you are ready I will convince your family immediately. Your family is already impressed. Okay, tell me.. ..what did you see in me that you didn't find in others? When I was a kind, Bebe gave my sister a doll. She knitted her eyes and nose first. It was a beautiful doll. My sister used to get me married to her. You are just like that doll that Bebe made. Will we go for honeymoon after marriage? No problem! I will convince Bebe. I will name our kids. Of course! But I will decide their nicknames. Okay, fine. I am getting late for the college. Bye. Why are you in hurry? Say yes! Do you want to hear a yes after I decided our kid's names? I thought you are smart. Are you fooling me? I can't believe this. "Words make no sense to me. Leave it." "The distance between us doesn't matter." "Now that our eyes have spoken our minds.." "You don't have to say that you too love me." "You too love me. I know it." "You don't have to say that you too love me, I know it." "You don't have to say it." "I know nights feel never ending." "I have lost my slumber." "The season of love is carrying love in the air." "I would like to stay in your eyes all my life." "My feelings are as valuable as diamonds." "You don't have to say that you too love me." "You too love me. I know it. You don't have to say it." "You too love me. I know it. You don't have to say it." Talk to them today. -Don't worry. I will handle it. Brother-in-law, come here. Welcome. He is our elder son-in-law. Their alliance got fixed a few days ago. Greetings. -Okay. He is Gulsher Singh from Canada. He has got a proposal of his brother for Manraj. Sister-in-law, what is this? I love someone else. I don't want to meet anyone. Manraj. Go, get her ready. Listen to me. Manraj said, she loves someone else. Uncle, dad has called you. Keep it. Keep it. -Let me have one. -Get inside. Brother, only you can save our reputation. I can tell you this. Manraj is having an affair with someone. We have to kill him! Did she tell the name? -No, she didn't. It's okay! I mean, let them go. We will look into this matter later. Yes, this is also fine. Brother, you have to find an Indian girl to marry. Did you like her? -Yes. Okay. Allow us to leave. We will get them engaged before we go to Canada. -Yes. As you wish! -Great! Let's go. -Yes. -Okay. Come on. -Greetings. -See you. -See you. Talk to them. They said they will kill me. I don't care. Talk to them. Will they listen to me? They are eager to send you to Canada. 'Brother-in-law.' -They will beat me up. Yes, brother. -Ask her about the guy. Who is the guy? Fool! Who? Look at their faces! Brother, I was having fun! Well, he has beautiful eyes. Where does he stay? Canada or England? Nikka, what do you think? Isn't he handsome? We make a good pair. You fool! You scared us. -You scared me. Nikka! Nikka! -What? Look at him! He is asleep. Bhola. -Yes. -You and Nikka have dinner together. Great! Am I here to serve your grandson? Hello. -'What? Will you speak to them or not?' Yes, Manraj. I will manage to do something. Have patience. 'I can have patience. You said you impressed them.' I will do something. 'But you won't speak. I will go to Canada.' Who are you consoling? Have your food. I tried. Bhole, my buddy, can't you do it? How can I do it? I am not a magician. You will get us in trouble. Either your grandma or her family will kill us. Bhola, I think my ancestors are upset with me. Who? A few days ago, I said wrong things about my ancestors. I think, they cursed me. They are resting in peace. Look at your grandma here. Don't say that. Get a scheme. All my scheme fail, thanks to you! Your grandma is an obstacle. Break it. Break some more utensils. People die at your age. I wonder when you will die. Bebe, we didn't talk to the girl's family about a car. Yes, son! We will get you a car. But no problem, I will get you. Bhola, come down. Bebe, why did you miss me? Bless me. Are you that important for me? What do you think about dowry? What? Dowry! Taking dowry is immoral. What is immoral in this? His mother got some. I also gave dowry. I will ask for a car for my son. My grandson is handsome. They have to give something to her. That's a tradition. Bebe, someone must have felt pity.. ..for their daughter's husband.. And would have given dowry, that became a tradition. Don't make fun of me. I will beat you up. Makkya, should I ask a kada for you? What will I do with it? -Fine! You will give it to me. Don't take it. I will make earrings for me. I suggest you to get Saggi Phulls. It will suit your age. I will slap you. Stay away. You talk nonsense all the time. I thought you said they won't take a rupee. What's the matter now? Yes, they said why do they have to save all the money? Talk to them about money. Pay them some amount. Uncle, I won't marry in the family of greedy people. Uncle, how will you face society if Seerat won't get married? Brothers will feel embarrassed. But don't worry. I will marry him to maintain your reputation. How will you maintain our reputation? I think they are not the right people. No problem. We will manage. Call them and fix marriage five days from now. Hurry up. So soon! Let that poor daughter stay in her home for few days. Why have you become to strict? You call them! Don't teach me. They are calling us. You must answer them. Talk to them. Now you deal with them. I won't get insulted. Hello, greetings. Yes, I am Major Sigh. Okay. Okay. Hold on. Bebe, they want marriage to happen on the fifth day from now. That's great! Tell them, we are okay with it. Bebe, don't rush things like this. What's your problem? We don't have to do much preparations. Listen to me. We will take you there in your decent clothes. We will bring her home with a grand procession. Son, I want to attend your wedding. He can die anytime. Why would I die? Will you live forever? God will answer my prayers one day. I bet you! You won't survive this summer. Bebe, I agreed for this marriage. Great! -Bapu, have you ever done a good job? Bebe, should I get new clothes stitched for me? Why do you need one? Is this your marriage? Okay, Bebe? Son, tell me. Which car do you want? Should we get you a four wheeler? I don't want one. Get him one. Have you lost it? What is this? I asked you to break this alliance. I didn't ask you to fix wedding date. I will kill you if you will come my home to marry her. No problem. -I will also ask for 500 thousand rupees to allow you. I will go to Canada and you will witness it. I will send you selfies clicked with that boy. You will know how I am. Right, brother-in-law? You are eager to go abroad. You'll miss me during cherry picking. Don't worry. I will do something. Do you know, when I went to fetch water from the motor.. I missed you and my leg got hurt. Enough! Stop this drama. Aren't you scared? -Yes. I am scared when I am alone. But I don't feel scared when I am with you. Say all these sweet things to our families. I can also tell them about us but it'll.. Be your insult. It will be a mess. You don't know how my Bebe is. I will speak to them. Sardar, I need your help. I don't know. Talk to Bebe. How did you become a father? You ask everything to Bebe. Can't you take a stand? Take an example of my motorcycle. You are right. Sardar, I don't feel like greeting you. You expect Rama to do all the work.. ..but when it comes to returns.. You will ask Bebe to pay me. Be a man! Your name is Major but you act like a coward. You should wear bangles. Keep going! He will feel ashamed after your rant. Yes. Except this one, you don't do anything like a man. I am telling you, you are no more a man. You will know how it feels to be poor. You won't get it. Leave now. -Stop it. Say something. See if you can do something to get respect as my father. Yes. Tell me what did you want to say. Bebe, my son is unhappy with this marriage. What's wrong with you? Bebe, I am fine. Nikka is not happy with this marriage. No one can be happy in a marriage. Men are selfish. He could have spent two more years happily.. In the college, but he ruined it. Bebe, you don't know about me and her.. I will hit you with this if you will talk nonsense with me. You can have a word with her. What do I do about it? He is a fool! Bapu, I beg of you please convince her. Will you break my bones at this age? Son, get married got Bebe's happiness. I can't help you. I hate my grandfather for finding a son-in-law like you. Bapu, where did you find this firecracker? I was fifteen years old when I got married. Family said they got me a gift and she was my gift. How fool were they to get this bomb as a gift for a young boy? Are you done or not? Sit properly. I have to teach him everything. Bebe, is this pistol real? No, I got this to play police-police with him. Go now. Nonsense! Oh! -Get some tea here. [Random chats]. [Random chats]. Manraj, listen to me. I will be there in two minutes. Nikka, your father keeps an eye on me. I don't understand the reason. Don't talk to him. She didn't like the shimmer belt. How dare you? -You are here to take buttermilk on his wedding day. Bebe, I came here to congratulate him. Look at you! Can't you see all the glory here? Son, where are you going? -I have some work. No, son. Today turmeric will be applied to you. Don't go out. Bebe, do you have some buttermilk? I beg of you. It is kept there. Take it on your own. But don't come here again. Son, come on. Come inside. -Bebe, let me go. I will come back soon. -I will manage everything. Come on. Come on. I will ask someone else to get it done. They are rich. I don't know why they don't treat Bebe's illness? Come on. Let me tell you one thing. A guy eloped with a girl before his marriage. My father caught him and beated him up in arena. Bebe, don't teach me. I forget everything. -So what? You never pay attention. Give those boots. Oh God! You wore socks. This is a fashion now. -Come on. Here. -Oh God! Come on. [Traditional song]. [Traditional song]. [Traditional song]. Hello. Hello. [Traditional song]. "We tried staying apart. We tried staying quiet." "I tried rejecting you." "I tried to convinced my heart. We are in this situation." "But I couldn't manage it." "We have our world living inside me." "You cannot escape from love." "You cannot live without love." "You can't escape love. You can't live without love." Let me do it. -Where are you going? Hello. -Hello. Where are you? I am trapped with these singing old ladies. They tied something on my hand so that I don't go out. Tell me what do I do? I am dying. Hello. Hello. Attend your calls later. Let's finish this ritual first. Come on. "I over-thought about it." "Why don't you accept that your love is your life?" "Why are you scared? Why are you emotional? You look upset," "You tried your best but failed." "You can't escape love. You can't live without love." "You can't live without love. You can't escape love." "You can't escape love. You can't live without love." "You can't live without love. You can't escape love." "Eyes are helpless. We are helpless." "Tears are unstoppable."

"You can't escape love. You can't live without love." "You can't live without love. You can't escape love." [Traditional song]. Hello. -Let me talk to your sister for a minute. Seerat. What? -Nikka is on the call. Hello. -Hello. You swear on me. Please don't create a scene. 'I wanted to tell you one thing.' Manraj and I love each other. I know you will feel sad to lose a handsome guy like me. But please think about your sister. I promise I will find you a good groom. Why did send a proposal for me? I sent the proposal for her only but we got engaged. Can't you change tomorrow with Manraj. Just try to be Manraj's sister. Do you want me to die? I can't do it. No one will be convinced here. You can elope if you want. Your sister looks fool but makes sense sometimes. Are you ready? We have to do this. Fine. You be ready, I will be there. Now we have to leave peacefully. Son, why are you doing all this? Go to sleep. Give this to me. Sister in laws will take it. You take it after the wedding. My son will sleep beside me tonight. I waited eagerly for your marriage. I believed interest is important than the capital. Come on. What did he say? -He said, let's elope. Don't worry. I am with you. "Your dad isn't Laden, to blast a bomb." "Your brother can't do anything, if I elope with you." "Your beloved will wander in the street." "I will beat anyone who rebukes you." "I will whack them." Bebe, come, dance with us. It's your grandson's wedding. Grandmother special dance here. -Stop this nonsense. You act like a fool after drinking. What nonsense is going on? Don't you want to get up in the morning? What are you doing here? Will you dance with youngsters? Go in. Son, come with me. Bapu, go. -You had enough. Brother, have milk. Take some. -Yes. Do you want some? -No. This is the biggest problem. Why do they tap it all day? Let me check. -Oh God! [Traditional song]. Here it goes! I will get rid of this problem now. [Traditional song]. Let me see how he makes calls now. [Traditional song]. "Aunt starts dancing whenever drum starts beating." "Uncle dances on the beats. Brother dances on the beats." "Brothers start dancing on the drum beats." Oh my God! Where is he? Bhola. -What happened? I am sure he must have told you. Do you know where he is? I have not spoken to him. I don't know. Oh my God! Groom eloped. -What happened? Did he die? He always wake up at midnight. Now there is a problem he is fast asleep. I don't know how you delivered a fool. Mother, it's been thirty years I am tolerating your son. Major, you are unlucky. Your son and your father are useless. Come on, let's go to Shanti's house. -Come on. Let's go. Hurry up. -Be quick. Bebe, should we keep this decoration? Forget about decoration. My son eloped. You want more flowers. Come on. Come. Run away! Let's go. Thank you. Come on. -Mention not. Go now. Come on, hurry up. Oh God! I am doomed. My life is ruined. She eloped with my husband! My life is ruined. What happened? -What's the matter? Manraj eloped with my husband. I saw it myself. My sister back-stabbed me. What are you waiting for? Get the car. What happened? -Nothing has happened. Keep calm. How do I face the society now? Did you connect? Yes. -Come on. -Get in the car. Come on. -Hurry up. -Be quick. What are you waiting for? -Come on. Setha, open the door. Won't you open the door? Open it. I got tired banging on that door but you came out of this one. What's the matter? Did you worry about henna? I have no issues. Tell me where is Shanti? She went to her grandma's home. -Fool! She eloped with Nikka. No, I am telling the truth. -She is at her maternal uncle's home. I think she has lied to you. You believed her. Tell me the truth. Where is Shanti? Did you see this? Hello. What? Really? No! Oh! Bebe, Nikka's brother-in-law called. Nikka eloped with Manraj. What! Did he elope with two girls? You son is characterless. What are you waiting for? Do something. I am dying. I am tired of talking. Bebe, tell me the medicine. You are useless! Get in the car and find them. Be quick. Where are you? -I am on the tracks behind your home. Come here before the train pass. You will see I will enter your in-law's house as a ghost. Listen to me. We don't have to do anything. We have a chance now. Check again. Are you lying to me? I am lying on the railways tracks where mosquitoes bite me. Oh! I told you not to worry. Go home and sleep. I need to check the facts. I will sit here. I will die right here if you will get married tomorrow. Fine! Do as you wish. Seerat, what are you doing? -I will talk to you later. Sister-in-law, why did I get this punishment? What wrong did I do? Nothing. Everything will be fine. Come on. Oh! Where is he? He isn't here yet. Where were you? Mosquitoes bite me. Take it. Keep it right in my room. Don't wander on it. Fine. I don't want to die. Sister-in-law, greetings. -Greetings. Go now. Meet her later, brother-in-law. I'm not a younger brother-in-law. I am the elder one. See you. Happy running marriage life. -Let's go. Brother, both our families are upset. Manage it. Thank you, Nikka. Did anyone of you get guns? No. -Are you here to play drums? Who will release you if they will catch you? Bebe, we have this one. -This is mine. Nonsense! It's all a mess. Brother, we are not here to console you. Your son eloped with our daughter. Oh! -Why are you acting like a fool? Talk to me. You act like a smart uncle. Why weren't you aware when he arrived here on a bike? Listen to her. We lost our dignity. -Did you lose anything? You couldn't find a bride all your life. Do you have any dignity? I told you to talk to me if you want to say anything. Got it? There is no one among you with whom I can discuss this issue. Your daughter eloped, so is our son. What's the problem? -He is awake now! You will go far away if anyone will slap you once. We don't want to have your funeral instead of a wedding here. Look at them! They have six people to talk. Look at us. We are here! Okay, come in the front. Go and take the blankets and baskets. Let's sit. Let them finish first. We will argue later. Don't joke around. I have to take the marriage procession. Don't get into a fight. Are you okay? Are you scared? No. You? A little. We will get married but there is no one with us. We will get separated from our families. Manraj, I didn't want to elope with you. I didn't want to run away. What's the point in ruining family reputation to get married? You are right. All of this was wrong. I don't know why I feel.. ..we should have spoken to our families. How could we speak to them? Your family would have beaten me up. They would have killed me. Parents are never wrong. They want their kids to be happy. Even if they will hit us, it is for our benefit. Why are you staring at me? It's your fault. You got us in this. What nonsense! Did I suggest them to elope? Your son is a fool. Why are you cursing these poor people? If we start beating, what will happen of you." I am with you. Then you can beat me up if you want. Is it only boy's mistake and is that girl innocent? How dare you? Don't look at me. Answer him now. Bebe, keep quiet. -I will shoot you. Decide it today. Seerat, Manraj or Shanti. I agree that I made a mistake. I eloped with your daughter but I got her back. Please listen to me. Manraj and I love each other. I sent a proposal for Manraj. Oh, I see! I didn't know it. Manraj, aren't you ashamed? You didn't think about us, about Seerat! No, it's not Manraj's fault. I stalked her. You can check engagement photos. I wasn't happy. I swear on my father, I never ever loved any other girl. I love Manraj with all my heart. She too loves me. I only want to say that I don't want TV, fridge, house. I am ready to marry her just one set of clothes. Why are you proving me to be a liar for your love? We will get humiliated among our relatives. Brother, you say it was a printing mistake. No one will know it. Enough! I respect all the elders here so I ask you to leave. Listen, I agree he made a mistake. If you want to beat him up or get him arrested.. Then it's your decision. No, it's okay. That's all. Come on. Get in. I wanted to say something. I accept they made a mistake. But they were wise to come back home. What we could have done if they had eloped? We would have stayed home feeling insulted. He is our child. We can't see them in pain. We ask your younger daughter in marriage. Give her to us. How can we just give away her? Go and come prepared. -I see! Come back. Have some tea and snacks. Come on. Girls,, go, get some tea and snacks for them. Come on. God has batter plans for us. Bebe, invite Shanti. Son, why do you want her to be here? Bebe, I wrote those letters. She doesn't know about it. What? I was angry with her for no reason! Bebe, fix her marriage with me and make up for it. Can you stop? Bebe, you are too arrogant. God is watching you. Stop this. Will you take her home now? We won't cross any line. -Where is the line? Bebe, keep calm. Listen, he only wants your daughter and nothing else. He is right here. He is the great Sharry Mann. No doubt. You can check, you can count. Bebe has nothing to do now. I have brought the boy directly to you. The old ladies keep taunting. The girl didn't bow, didn't seek blessings. Come here. -Show us your daughter. No, why do we have to see her? There are only two complexions. Fair and dark. Girl should be wise. Looks don't matter. Destiny cannot be changed. Well, I got fooled the last time. But this time I am sure this guy is the right choice. His last sentence has impressed me. See, he always speaks sweet. Lovers were right. We love with honesty, we win it with honesty. Intelligence doesn't work here. Yes they forgot during the wedding.. ..but they will invite for kid's naming ceremony. All the couples in the corner seat should get married. "You walk like a peacock." "You can douse a lamp with your wink." "Your eyes are like open swords.. ..that can cut through Sardars." "You have wooed my heart." "You sway on the streets, like a breeze." "You sway on the streets, like a breeze." "You are amazing. Everyone respect you." "You are amazing. Everyone respect you." "The problem is solved as the girl.." "..returned after her education." "The village is on your side as you returned after education." "You are so virtuous. I can even give my life for you." "I pray to God to make you my destiny." "If you leave me, I will die." "If you leave me, I will die." "You are so virtuous. I can even give my life for you." "I pray to God to make you my destiny." "If you leave me, I will die." "If you leave me, I will die."
