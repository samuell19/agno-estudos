On May 18-20, 1944, the entire Crimean Tatar population was deported from Crimea to Central Asia and the Urals. Officially, there were 194110 of them. After the war, demobilised Crimean Tatar soldiers and officers of the Soviet Army were also forcibly moved to Central Asia and the Urals. According to mid-1960's population census, there was 238500 of deported Crimean Tatars, 205900 of whom were women and children. During the deportation and resettlement 109956 of them died from famine and disease. Which is more 4 times more than the death toll of Crimean Tatars in the War. What will you name your child?
