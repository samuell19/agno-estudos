THE BEAST MUST DIE AND MAN MUST ALSO DIE, YES, THEIR FATE IS THE SAME ECCLESIASTES 3:19 I believe it is my right to know why Felix is not welcome in this house. Because he's a pig! A filthy pig! You think everyone's a pig, that's no explanation. When you find out, you'll hate him too! Whatever he did, I forbid you to insult him. Who are you to forbid me? I'll do what I like in my house. That doesn't mean you can insult people. My son must have his reasons. He doesn't need reasons to show that he's vulgar. - Please stop, Linda. - Shut up! Let her say what she wants. It's her fault for bringing that pig into this house. - You are the only pig here. - Me? I could get rid of you both with one hand. But I have a better punishment for you. Do you know the reason you met Felix Lane? Do you know why he approached you? You don't know, do you? I'm going to tell you, you poor wretch. Your dear Felix Lane, that poor lout was... What is happening to me? What is happening? Jorge, what is wrong? I've been poisoned. I've been poisoned. Son! Jorge! - Linda, a glass of water! - Don't let me die! Who was it? He said... "Never can come... "very soon." Connect me to Hotel Armele, to Mr. Felix Lane. Yes, it's urgent. Felix? Yes, please. - It's urgent. It seems that... - Why are you calling him? - Let go, I must talk to him. - What for? Doctor Morrison, please. Jorge! Jorge. Jorge. My son. Son! They've killed Jorge! They've murdered my son! They've murdered my son! Yes. I'd have to take the first train. Alright. Tell me if this is right: Hotel Armele. You go by the name Felix Lane. Understood. Which Felix Lane is that? The detective novel writer? - What did he say? - That his real name is Frank Carter. Felix Lane is a pen name. I understand. Poor man, his secret must have kept him up all night. And this morning, after a cold shower, he thought, I will tell everything to the famous lawyer, Nigel Strangeways. Isn't that right? This is serious. It's a very strange affair. This Felix Lane had planned to kill a man but failed. Now he's really been killed, by poison. I see! Felix Lane has been poisoned? No, the other guy. He is a friend of Dickson's and asked me to defend him. No. - I don't believe a word of it. - Please, darling. I know you too well. You're cooking up a story SO you can go there. Only for a few days, honey. Think how awful it must be, a decent man, mixed up in this. Not so decent, he wanted to kill someone. I don't want to be left alone because of Felix Lane. I must go. This whole thing is too implausible. And if someone killed the other guy, why did he admit that he also wanted to kill him? He didn't, honey, it's far worse. He wrote it all down in a notebook, a diary, that's now in the hands of our old pal Inspector Blount. Did Mr. Rattery take his medicine in a glass or a spoon? He measured it with a soup spoon, then mixed it in a glass of water. Did you wash this? I don't wash. I remove things. You didn't remove the bottle? I already told you, the bottle had disappeared. This substance tastes like medicine I used to take, it contained Nux vomica. That's why he didn't taste the strychnine. - So you've ruled out suicide. - In some ways... With suicide, people don't usually swallow the vial with the poison. Rattery's sister-in-law, Linda, bothers me. - Why? - She's in love with your defendant. - How do you know? - My intuition. Plus, the servants told me. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't mind, let us continue. Mrs. Rattery, can you tell me why your husband took the medicine? For his nervous dyspepsia. Jorge was very irritable. When people irritated him. My son didn't put up with hypocrisy. - From who, for example? - From his wife. Jorge didn't let anyone fool him. - He knew that Violeta hated him. - That's not true. You tried to make me hate him by pointing out his affairs. I just showed you the woman who was after him. - Are you insinuating that's me? - You and your generous husband. Excuse me, Madam, I never saw anything. And your son was my partner and our friend. Isn't that so, Rhoda? A very attentive friend. Speaking of which, he was even worse with his sister-in-law. - You told me so. - What are you implying? Nothing. That escapade at my house. You and Rattery were "playing around". Let me tell you, that wasn't play. Rattery was always a beast. He never left me alone, although I was his wife's sister. Please Linda, no more. Are you going to remain silent? Are you still afraid of him? He died. He was killed! And you should be grateful! Do you hear that? Those people were my son's "friends". It'll be easy to find his Killer. Whichever one of us poisoned him had reason to kill him. And you, what was your reason to kill him? He destroyed the lives of my sister and her son. He chased me like a beast. He made me his... His what? You are exactly the same, incapable of respecting human rights. Please, calm down. Only answer my questions. Miss Lawson, when you returned to the dining room, while they stayed with him, - did you see the medicine bottle? - No. I was too nervous. Your nerves didn't stop you making a call, - instead of bringing the water. - Please, Madam. - So you don't remember anything? - No. Who did she speak to? Her friend. Could you tell me, Mr. Lane, why she called you? To tell me that Rattery was in trouble. - Did she tell you how he was poisoned? - No. I heard about the strychnine later. The one I use in my garage to Kill rats. Only rats? Only rats. Mr. Lane knew that. - You were in his garage? - I was. Do you remember when? The day before our friend's unfortunate death. Tell me, Mr. Carpax, was the strychnine locked away? No, anyone could have taken it. But I'm not the only one who has it. Anyone can get hold of it easily. Apparently you haven't been here in the last three days. Which proves I didn't kill him. - And you, not since the day before. - She didn't kill him either. Despite what Rattery's mother says we were very fond of him. You may all leave, now. Not you, Mr. Lane. My respects. Let's go, honey. Excuse me, I forgot to offer my deepest condolences. How is it possible that you, an expert in detective plots, What mistake? This one. Writing with your own hand, a plan to kill Jorge Rattery. A mistake that luckily has become the proof of Mr. Lane's innocence. After Rattery left you on the pier, - what did you do? - I went straight to Hotel Armele. Rattery was to send me my luggage. He had forbidden me to return to this house. - And after Miss Linda's call? - I came straight here. The doctor was already here. He confirmed the poisoning. I saw my predicament. I knew Rattery's lawyers had my diary. The police would be aware of my plan to kill him, and here was Rattery, murdered. A simple case for you, Inspector. Not so simple. I think it's unlikely you're the murderer. It won't be hard to prove. I'd almost say I agree, but if by any chance you are guilty, though I admit, from reading this, you had reasons for revenge, I won't save you from the gallows. That seems fair, though not very encouraging. Don't worry. You didn't do it, that's what matters. If I had done it, I wouldn't regret it. Rattery really was a beast. - Anything else, Inspector? - Yes, you can't leave here without my permission. I ask you to remain in the room you occupied before the crime. Of course. Between friends, what do you think? I already told you, he's innocent. I'm sure that someone other than Rattery knew about Lane's diary and used it to blame him for the crime. Why were you scared? I wasn't scared. - Are you sure? - Yes, sir. Alright. I came to tell you that we may not meet again. Blount wants to blame me for your step-father's death. - Will they take you away? - No. For now, I'm imprisoned in my bedroom. - We'll still be friends, right? - Yes, sir. If you've anything to tell me, you know where I am. Could you leave me the diary? I'd like to check a few things. No problem. Each page has been photographed. - What do you make of his partner? - Carpax? - Off the record? - Of course. The same as you. A pig. - Did you see something? -I... Is it true the inspector is accusing Felix? It is his job to suspect everyone. For now, I'm the only one to escape. - Seriously, is he in danger? - Don't worry. I intend to prove his innocence. If the bottle were to appear, would that help? Absolutely, we'd know for sure if it contained poison. But wouldn't that harm Felix? Do you know where it is? No, but my nephew does. How do you know? I saw him take it, but I don't know where he put it. He wouldn't tell me, because... he thinks he's helping Felix. Alright. I'll take care of this. Do you promise to do all you can to prove Felix's innocence? Felix or Frank? Frank? Don't you know Felix Lane is Frank Carter's pen name? - Felix's name is Frank Carter? - Yes. This explains it. And there's a secret that concerns you. Read it. The police will find out that your mother poisoned my son. Not my mother, you are lying. It wasn't my mother. She hated him because of Rhoda. You know that, you must tell the police. Swear to me. Swear that you'll tell them. Let me go! Let me go! Not until you swear you'll do it! You'll have a guilty conscience for life if you hide a murderess. Go away! I hate you! I hate you! No. You have to do it! Only I can protect you when they hang your mother! Come on. - That's too much. - What do you want? Only to see each of you. May I be alone with Ronnie? Trust me. Would you be so kind as to help me? Calm down. Nobody suspects your mother. - Is that true? - Yes. We all know she's too kind to hate anybody. She had reason to hate him. I hated him. I know you've suffered a lot and that you're incapable of hate. - Do you know I'm here to defend Felix? - Yes, sir. - He is very fond of you. - I'm fond of him too. Then you must help him. Help him? How, sir? You hid the bottle, didn't you? I know you did. But by hiding it, you're harming Felix. - Why? - If it doesn't appear, he'll be blamed. If it does, they'll see the poison. That will prove Felix's innocence. He couldn't have put it there as he wasn't here. Do you understand? If I tell you where it is, do you promise you won't tell anyone? I promise. Alright. There. In the gutter. - We need a ladder. - No! I can go fetch it. Help me. - Why did you throw it? - I dropped it. No, you threw it. Who cares? Now nobody will know what was in the medicine. - You fake! - Why? Because of this. I thought that you befriended me innocently. That you were the only man I could trust. Wasn't I? You were the most calculating, the most selfish one of all. You only cared about revenge. You are unfair. Extremely unfair. You are a fine one to talk. What about Ronnie? And my sister? I wasn't the only one to trust you. You hypocrite. You deceived us all. You didn't care about anything or anyone. - That's not true. -Yes, it is. And where did it get you? You didn't manage to kill Rattery. Someone else killed him. Unfortunately it wasn't me. You are worse than him. All you care about is that you didn't become a murderer. You don't care that you betrayed me, only that you didn't kill him. Your soul is hard. You've never felt love for anyone. What about my son? Of course, for you that means nothing. It's easy to condemn others. But not so easy to bear that memory, to hide the anguish, to pretend all the time... It's not easy. It's easier to forget guilt. No. No, please, not that. It wasn't my fault. I couldn't do anything to prevent it. We were fighting. Rattery had his hands all over me, I fought him off, and in a rage, he sped into the terrified child. It was horrible. I asked him, I begged him not to abandon him. - I told him he might die. - Please, don't go on. I've spent many sleepless nights. It has driven me crazy. At first I kept quiet out of fear. Then, it was too late. Forgive me. Forgive me, I didn't mean to hurt you. Many things have happened. Neither you nor I can change the past. Do you forgive me? Excuse me, I didn't think that... If I'd known such bad things would happen, - I wouldn't have gotten involved. - Why do you say that? There's no chance now, that you'll be sitting in a courtroom. What a way to share the news. I'd never have done so, anyway. I watched a trial once and I don't want to do it again. You have no choice but to do so. To testify against Ronnie in the trial for the murder of his step-father. What? Inspector Blount told me that you are now free. That's stupid. Blount is crazy. You are all crazy. How could you think that Ronnie poisoned Rattery? He hid the bottle of poison. When he saw he'd been caught, he broke it to hide the evidence. That means nothing. You can't believe it was Ronnie. If you'd seen him jump on me when I tried to recover the medicine, you'd believe me. I thought he'd gone mad. - Rattery's torture made him crazy. - Please don't say that. It can't have been him. I'm sure it wasn't him. There's no concrete proof against him. There is. This piece of paper. Inspector Blount. I put the poison in the medicine. I killed my step-father because he hit my mother. Ronnie Hersher. Where is he? I want to talk to him. He escaped. Inspector Blount has called for a search. Now you see why I'd have rather not gotten involved? Why couldn't it have been someone else? Ronnie reminded me of Martie and of what Martie might have been. - Martie! - Your order, Captain? - Ready to tack. - Understood, Sir. Happy birthday, Mr. Carter. Thank you. - Are you out for a walk? - Yes, we went sailing. - Did you like Martie's present? - I haven't seen it yet. It was hard to find what your son wanted. You promised not to say anything! I just wanted to tell your father that the bookbinder... - Please, Mrs. Anderson. - Don't worry. Whatever she says, I know nothing. - See you tomorrow. - A long life to you. Thank you. Drunken sailor! Why are you walking in the middle of the road? How are you, General Dixon? - Hello. - "Hello." Is that how you greet a guest? - A guest for what? - Isn't today July 6th? - Yes. - Aren't I invited to dinner? Yes, but you won't get there in time in this old banger. This young thing is a real automobile. Not one of those gadgets they use on the highways. Get in, I'll take you. After you, General. I hope dear Matilde has cooked for the guest rather than the birthday boy. You can be sure of it, General, she loves you. What is this? My present. A genuine Mohammedan sword. To make it mine, I had to send a man to the other side, he wanted to do the same to me. Happy birthday! General, how can you part with a souvenir like this? Don't worry, I have eight more. At last, you're here! Good evening, General Dixon, are you well? Not as well as you, Miss Matilde. I hear we're eating chicken pot pie. How did you guess, General? Give me that before you get hurt. Go get ready, now! You, too. May I have a whiskey with the General first? Alright, but I insist Martie goes up, he doesn't drink whiskey yet. You go, so I can stay. - Martie? -Yes? Where's your present? In my bedroom. - When will you give it to him? - After dinner. From man to man, any chance you could tell me what it is? All I can say is that it's something to help Dad with his next murder. What barbarity! - What is it, General? - The things that kid says! - And all because of what you write. - Don't exaggerate. Excuse me, Frank, but we'll never agree on that. That a mathematician of your standing should stoop to this. Frank Carter the mathematician has nothing to do with Felix Lane. You think that a pen name resolves everything. General, you must understand me, since my wife died, I'm unable to return to science. And my murder novels that worry you, distract me. - And they support Martie and I. - It's still a shame. What will your colleagues think when they find out? Don't worry, General, only my family, you and my editor know my real identity. He won't let the cat out of the bag. It suits him to keep the secret. - Martie! - What, Dad? - Are there any cigarettes in my room? - I'll go see. Well, these things will end up ruining your talent. What titles! Murder in the Air. Murder on the Train. Murder in the Mist. Unexpected Murder. Utopian Murder. - Why don't you read one? - Me? They are basically mysteries. They are more innocent than you think. Martie really likes them. Martie reads those things? He has all of them in his room and he loves them. How awful! There are no cigarettes, Dad. Ask Matilde to get me some from Mrs. Anderson's shop. I'll go, Dad. Matilde is very busy. It is late for a young man to be outside alone. It is also late for a lady to be outside alone. I'd better go. - Let me go, Dad. - Young man... Can't you see that it's dark and misty out there? So what? I'm not scared of anything, am I, Dad? I know you're not afraid but... But you won't let me go? Alright, be careful. Off you go. Thank you, Captain. - How many packets? - Six, boatswain. He'd have been very upset if I had refused. You are right. What a valiant young man. That was Tessa's biggest concern. She wanted her son to be brave. A real man. Good evening, Mrs. Anderson. - Martie, why are you here? - Carrying out orders. Give me six packets of Dad's cigarettes. - Couldn't Matilde come? - She was busy. Wait for me. I'll shut the shop and come with you. Do you think I'll get lost? I'm a man. You be a man if you like, but I'm taking you home. I'll be back in a minute. The food is ready. We're coming! What happened next? She kept asking me what would make her beautiful. I couldn't take anymore, so I told her, "Shave, Madam!" General, you can't deny that wasn't very kind. That's why I wasn't promoted. She was the Prime Minister's wife. Thank you, Matilde. What do you think, General? I expect nothing less than perfection from Miss Matilde. Always so kind. - Can I serve, sir? - Yes, Matilde. Where's Martie? - Wasn't he with you? - No, he must be in his room. Martie! A drop of sherry, General? No alcohol before dinner. Perhaps a little whiskey. Colonel Dowell used to say that he couldn't drink pure whiskey because when he saw the bottle, his mouth watered. - Your whiskey. - And that's how poor Dowell died from dropsy. Martie! It's strange he hasn't come back. He must be chatting with Mrs. Anderson. Excuse me, General, I'll see if he's coming. Martie! If he'd been treated in time, he'd have been saved. Only a beast could have run him over and left him bleeding to death. What did it look like? What did it look like? - It was a white car. - No, you're wrong. It was a black car. It was a gray car. - A black car, driven by a man. - A gray car, driven by a woman. - It was a black car. - It was a gray car. - Driven by a man. - Driven by a woman. Driven by a man. It was a white car. Driven by a woman. If he'd been treated in time, he'd have been saved. If he'd been treated in time, he'd have been saved. Sooner or later, the police will find the culprit. They'll be accused of recklessness, given a fine, or at the most a few years in prison. But that won't bring Martie back. Whoever killed him will be allowed to go free and will Kill others. Unless... Unless what? Are you ready for your trip? - If you agree, Doctor. - You know what I think. I'd rather he stayed a few more days. - A month seems too short to you? - In your case, yes. You must try to get over this apathy, Carter. But if you insist on leaving, I trust the General will help you. Leave it to me. Try to convince him to tidy himself up a bit. People might think we neglect our patients. I want to go in alone. I need to do this. If I can't manage it, I can't go on living. What do you want? Don't you recognize me? Sir! Forgive me. I didn't recognize you. Everything looks just the same. I didn't dare touch anything. Have you had a drink? Can I get you a cup of tea? No thank you, Matilde, don't worry. You don't look very well. Are you tired? - Do I look that bad? - No, not really. But that beard doesn't help. You should shave. Why? Trust in God. He will make sure the culprit is punished. Will he really? There are no cigarettes, Dad. Ask Matilde to get me some from Mrs. Anderson's shop. I'll go, Dad. Matilde is very busy. The Diary of Felix Lane Dear Dad, If you don't want to keep a diary, you can use this for your notes when you write another murder, as you are always losing them. Happy birthday to you. Kisses, Martie. FAILED MURDER, SURPRISE MURDER, UTOPIAN MURDER... June 6, 1950 I am going to kill a man. I don't know his name, I don't know where he lives, I have no idea what he looks like, but I will find him and I will kill him. The boy was thrown to the left. So the broken headlight is probably on the left side. - That's all you found? - It's all we could do. If that sergeant did his job instead of hanging out with Tony's wife. Why were they on the road at night? Those automobiles are a curse. Life used to be peaceful in Cape Gold. Not all drivers are beasts capable of a hit and run. I didn't mean you. It's a shame about the boy. Believe me. I also miss him. More taxes and fewer policemen. So he didn't discover anything? Nothing. I'd give every finger on my right hand to find that lout. Believe me. My deepest sympathy. Thank you. Good night, friends. Why carry on like this, Frank? You're here? I went out for a short walk. I was waiting for you, Frank. Let's be honest. You cannot carry on like this. You must start your life over. Life no longer has a purpose for me. I was clinging to the hope of finding that murdering beast. I did all I could to find him... for nothing. Why carry on living? I understand your pain, Frank. But not your weakness. - What can I do? - Try to work, write, anything... Go sailing. Wasn't that your favorite hobby? I will never do it again. Martie spent hours in the boat that carried his mother's name, being rocked by the waves. It was as if Tessa's arms continued to cradle him. And what would Tessa think if she could see you now? Tessa, if you were alive, you'd tell me what I have to do. Shall I forward your post to the hotel? I don't know where I'll go to live. When I decide, I'll let you know. - Goodbye, Matilde. - Take care. - Good evening. - Evening. I'm sorry to bother you. There weren't any other houses. - Did something happen? - My car is stuck in the stream. Do you have a horse? Mirbor! Come in. You can dry off by the fireplace. Mirbor! - What is it? - See if you can help this man. - His car is in the stream. - I'll get it out. - I'll go with you. - No, I'll use the tractor. - But really... - I only have one pair of boots. - I'm so sorry to bother you. - Not at all. I'll make you a cup of tea. - Please don't worry. -Let me do it. - Where were you coming from? - Cape Gold. Were you going to the village? No, a little further, to the city. - How I'd love to live there. - I don't think so. - It's much better here. - Better? If it wasn't for the movie theaters... - Do you go often? - Not as often as I'd like. My son falls asleep. But in any case, nobody can stop me from going at least twice a week. - I can see you like it. - I sure do. I cut out photographs of actors and hang them up. - You've a good collection. - I have more in my bedroom. I'm very proud of that one. - Which one? - The one in the frame. She autographed it for me herself. - That's nice. - She's my favorite actress. I was so happy when I met her. - In the village? - No, here. - In my own home. - How interesting. About three months ago, it was already late. We had finished dinner and I was clearing up when I saw her appear at the door. I thought I was dreaming! - What was she doing here? - The same as you. She came with a gentleman and asked us to rescue their car. And what a car! It was an enormous car, gray, with a roof that goes up and down by itself. Incredible. Such a big car got stuck? It must have sunk deep and water got into the engine. When women drive, things happen. No, she wasn't driving. It was his fault. Poor girl. She was so upset that she was crying. - For such a trivial thing? - I think they'd been arguing. She didn't want to drive on, she kept saying: "We must go back, Jorge, we must go back."? But Jorge, instead of calming her down, only complained about his broken headlight. When was this? Three months ago. I wrote the date under her signature so I wouldn't forget it. As if I could forget that! What was Jorge's surname? - Is he an actor? - This is what he is: A pig! When I asked her to autograph the photo, he didn't want to let her. I was so insistent that she had to sign it. I couldn't miss out on that opportunity. June 6th. What a coincidence. The same day as my birthday. - Your birthday is June 6th? - Yes. Mine is the 20th of January. Was it a local car? No. We hadn't seen it before. And never again? Linda Lawson. This is one of the two people who saw Martie alive for the last time. I must approach her, without her knowing who I am. Through her, I will meet Jorge and kill him. If Linda hadn't been sick, we'd have finished last month. Was it serious? A severe depression. - An affair? - I don't think so. Something more serious. Cut! Excuse me. My dear Felix, I don't believe you grew a beard just to hide Frank Carter. - Why do you say that? - You've impressed Linda. - What is your point? - In one of Huxley's novels, he mentions how women are excited by beards. - Tired? - Dead! That is what my fans don't know, Mr. Lane. If they did, they'd admire you as much as I do. I hope your book will tell the truth about our trade. Sorry, Linda, Murder on the Set is a crime novel, not a documentary. Says the editor. Ignore him. Aren't you tempted to write a script for us? I never thought of that. It would be amazing, Mr. Lane. I'll give it a go if you'll be the star. - I'll hold you to that. - Agreed. As long as you can persuade Miss Lawson to lunch with me. Excuse me, Miss Lawson, you must get changed. I'm coming. See you soon. Tell your famous writer, Felix Lane, that I accept his lunch invitation. How are you? - Did I keep you waiting? - Not at all. I arrived one hour early. - What? - Of course. One waits fifteen minutes for an ordinary woman, thirty for a pretty woman, one hour for a beautiful woman, for you, no less than two hours. I didn't think crime writers could say such nice things. Looking at you, it's easy. May I serve, sir? Yes, please. How is Murder on the Set going? Not committed yet. - Did our set disappoint you? - No, it's fascinating. But all my ideas have merged into one, you. Me? I swore I'd write a script for you. I don't believe you. Felix Lane is too famous to waste his time on a simple actress. Yet it's you people are staring at. That's just curiosity. You are famous. A fame I'm not flattered by, based on murders that I didn't commit. - You'd have preferred real ones? - Perhaps. I'd like to know how it feels to have killed someone. Don't you like it? Yes, but I don't feel well. I see. You know that I was ill. Your producer mentioned it. Nothing serious? Just a little fatigue. You should take a holiday somewhere quiet and discreet. I don't like beach resorts. Too many people. The place I have in mind isn't a resort. It's a very quiet place, with amazing cliffs and a sea so beautiful that it's not a sea, it's like your eyes. - Why don't you write poetry? - That depends on you. Don't pretend that you'd write verses just for me. I'm not easily inspired, only by exceptional beauty. That's enough. Let's talk of something else. Where is this sea that resembles my eyes? In Cape Gold. Cape Gold? Yes, haven't you heard of it? I'd like to know what you really want from me. I don't understand. Yes. Where is all this going? I don't understand. Let's stop pretending. When will you declare your feelings? I... To tell you the truth, I was waiting for the coffee. I'm glad it was now. - Is it a bad thing? - No, but actually... The novel was an excuse to meet you. Ever since I saw your photograph, I became obsessed about meeting you. I don't believe you could be so vulgar as to fall for an actress in a photograph. Perhaps... But don't you think we could... No, Felix, not for the time being. I'd prefer us to be friends. Linda Lawson suspects nothing. We are friends. But I still haven't found out who Jorge is. It's beautiful. - It must have cost a fortune. - Don't worry. Before I go bankrupt, I'll get what I want. - Don't be so sure. -I am. Far more than you can imagine. Oh, you're so prickly. Miss Lawson, there's a call for you. I said I'm not available. It's long distance, your sister Violeta. Excuse me. Hello. What is it? I couldn't, I finished filming yesterday. What, again? What a scoundrel! Ronnie too? Yes, I know, but I can't. Do you really need me to come? If I do, I'll let you know. Why doesn't that louse die? - Anything serious? - No. Family matters. Shall we go? Let's. - I hope you missed me. - No. - Alright. - "Alright." He's grouchy like a cat. A naughty cat. Now he's Felix the Cat! - Careful he doesn't scratch you. - No chance. I'll trim his nails. And his beard. My kitten will have to shave. Impossible, darling. I'm a killer who must lie low, and this is my disguise. It's my turn. No, this place is very boring. - Let's go some place else. - To the Mona? Yes, it's more lively. Isn't that so, my kitten? Where is the Mona? - We're going to the Mona? - Of course. Why don't we abandon the others and go for a drink alone, at your house? That doesn't seem wise. Leaving the others? Going to my house at this time of night. What does that matter? We are friends. I know that my cat is very good. And between friends nothing can happen. In any case, it's inconvenient. - I suspected that. - What? - That you don't live alone. - Why? You won't take me home because you're married. - Me? - Yes. You live with your wife, kids, mother-in-law and the rest. - If you were single, we'd go. - Don't be childish. I swear if you don't take me, I'll be angry with you forever. Alright, we'll go. Good evening. Where is your wife? Go look for her. Madam? Madam? Is there anybody here? She's not in there. Madam? She's not there either. She must be in there. She must be here. Look what I found. Stop drinking. Just a little more, Professor. - Do I make a good lady of the house? - Perfect. See? And you didn't want to bring me. Bad boy. - It's not fake? - Certainly not. My poor bearded cat. She must be in there. Who does this belong to? What? This? Put that back. No way. My bearded cat plays with teddies. How funny. Give me that, I said. My cat has a teddy bear, my cat has a teddy bear. Don't play with that, Linda! Isn't it a toy? It's a keepsake. A keepsake. From a lady friend? No. It belonged to a nephew I was very fond of. He died. Now will you give it to me? - I won't. - Give it to me, it's not a toy. - I'll play with whatever I want! - If you weren't drunk you'd stop. So I'm not good enough to touch your dead nephew's toy? Don't be stupid! Stupid? Who do you think I am, any old hussy? I didn't come here to be insulted over this stupid thing! You brute! Let me go! Let me go! You beast! You beast! Beast! Don't think badly of me. I'm the one who should apologize. You must think I'm a floozy but I'm not. I swear I'm not. I drank too much. Sometimes I have to numb myself so as not to think. If only I could get it out of my head! What is it that worries you? - Something awful that drives me crazy. - Perhaps I can help you? Nobody can help me. We should be better friends. Isn't this enough? Friends like a man and a woman who unite forever. You'd marry me? If you'd like that. Oh, Felix. I have felt so alone. Everyone harasses me. Nobody approaches me honestly. I have only my sister and her son. And I rarely see them. Why? Because of Jorge. Who is Jorge? Violeta's husband. The most awful man ever. After the war, she was left alone with her son, I couldn't help her. She married him. She'd have been better off starving to death. Is he that bad? He's a beast who respects nobody. Have you seen him lately? I haven't seen him for over three months. I wish I'd never met him. If you don't see him... - I've unfinished business with him. - Business? Do you love me enough to do something for me? - No questions asked? - Of course. You must come with me to his house. With you by my side, he won't try anything. I have a way of guaranteeing that he never torments my sister or her son again. - Will you come? - Alright. Welcome, Miss Linda. Good afternoon, Guilder. - Mr. Lane. - Welcome, sir. Mr. Rattery has gone out. He welcomes you. - And my sister? - Madam is in her room. I was told to give your friend the upstairs bedroom. Your keys, please? Ronnie! Aunty! How are you, darling? Do you know who this is? It's Felix Lane. - From the books? - Do you know them? Yes, sir. Every one. - Your aunty loves you so much. - She's so kind. How long will you stay? Only a few days, darling. - How is Mother? - Looking forward to seeing you. I'm going to see Violeta. - Show him his room. - Come. Here it is, sir. Let me, Guilder. I'll help him. - A refreshment, sir? - No, thank you. - Do you have the key, sir? - Yes. - How old are you? - Twelve, sir. Already a man. - How is school? - So-so. - Don't you like studying? - I prefer reading. I was the same, but it's not good. Put those over there. I don't have this one. - Which? - This one: Murder in Green. It's only just come out. - Can I borrow it? - No. I'll give it to you. For my dear friend, Ronnie Rattery. No, sir. Ronnie Hershey. Hershey. - I prefer Hershey to Rattery. - Thank you. You must like living in such a pretty house. No. But it's a beautiful place. - Linda said one can sail here. - She mentioned my boat? - You have a boat? - My birthday present from Linda. It's not far away, do you want to see it? Alright. But I must say hello to your mother first. - Don't you think? - She won't be out for a while. Every time Linda comes, they spend hours in her room. Mother cries. Well... Here's what we'll do. Come and find me in a while. I'll get changed, and we'll go see your boat. Alright. It is worse each day. Now he hits me for any old thing. I can't take any more of him or his mother. That woman would do anything to destroy me. I hate her. I hate her as much as I hate him. Calm down, Violeta. I've come to take care of everything. Linda! I'm surprised you've not come to greet me. Violeta. Are you crying? Must I tell you again, the wife of a Rattery never cries! It's that one! Sioux? - Can you sail it? - Kind of. I'm learning with a caretaker from the club. But he has so much work... You have experience, don't you? - Quite a lot. - Would you be my captain? I'd be your boatswain. Yes. One of these days, we'll go sailing. I'll teach you the language of the wind. How to find the path between the waves. - I'll make you a friend of the sea. - Can you teach me all that? I taught it to a boy I loved very much. Loved? And where is he now? He died... because of a beast. So you write novels. That's correct. Detective novels. Crime stories. That reassures me. I thought Linda was going to bring me a real writer. Do you earn a lot writing those? Enough. Crime makes a lot of money. I don't know how people can read those things. If it was up to me, you'd starve to death. I find them very interesting. They teach you to how to Kill. So many people one would Kill! Who would you kill? I should be asking you that. Killing is always complicated. And good old Carpax doesn't like complications. - Isn't that so, Rhoda? - Don't believe it. One day, my husband will be brave and do something serious. Civil rights aside, I believe killing is very fair, especially people who have ruined others' lives. Linda, what a bloodthirsty young man you've chosen. Cat is too kind to believe what he said. "Cat"? Did you say "Cat"? Linda has brought us a cat. - Angora or Persian? - Linda calls me Cat because of Felix. That's even better. Felix the Cat. I imagine they'd call you Rat. Rattery. Rat. Sir? How unfair. I pay gold for this cognac and you lot get to drink it, - while I have to drink this rubbish. - What is it? - Jorge has a nervous dyspepsia. - Nobody asked you. Passing me off as a useless invalid like your dead husband? Stupid woman! How disgusting. It tastes like poison. You wish it were poison. I didn't say anything, sir. I can see it in your eyes. Please, Jorge, Ronnie is incapable of thinking that. Your son is capable of anything. Except thanking me for all I've done for you both. I can't even relax in my home because of this brat. Get out of here. I said get out! What a very unpleasant show. And it's late. I'm going to sleep. Come with me, Violeta. It is indeed quite late. Shall we go, Rhoda? - Family meetings are so fun. - What did you say? We should do this again. Come to lunch tomorrow. - You owe Rhoda a tennis match. - Alright. - See you tomorrow. - See you then. - Will you see us out, Linda? - No, I must speak with Jorge. Then you'll come. They have to talk. Jorge always has to speak to Linda. Unlike you. You've already been spoken to. Very clever, Linda. Come early tomorrow. I came because Violeta called me. I can't stand the life you are giving her and the boy. Change, or I'll report you to the police. I haven't forgotten that incident. Are you sure? The accessory gets the same sentence as the offender. I'm ready for anything. - You know I'm capable of... - Try. Did you bring that little man here to protect you? I'd flatten him with one punch. But not you... You, I'd... Were you worried about your girlfriend? Nothing has happened to her yet. I'll leave you with your little kitten. Calm down and tell me what happened. I told you he was a pig, but he's worse. Worse! You're anxious, it can't be that bad. - If you'd heard him. - Calm down. - He is easily excited. - No. He's capable of anything. He has no soul or compassion for anyone. He doesn't even care if he kills. You're saying he is a criminal? - If you knew... - What? I hate him. I hate him with all my soul. - What is it? - Nothing. Leave me alone. So you called your sister to complain about me? - No, I actually... - I'm a scoundrel, am I? I didn't say that. What did you say? - I can tell her to leave. - No, not now. You should have thought of that before. Since I am abusing you, - I mustn't prove you wrong. - No, please, Jorge. A good husband mustn't contradict his wife. - No, Jorge! - I'm going to... What's happening? He is beating my mother. Come here, calm down. I'm a coward! A coward! - I should kill him! - Don't say that. Come with me, it'll all be alright. Linda came here to sort this out. - Really, sir? - Yes. Go to your room. Let's go, it's getting late. - The same car? - What do you mean? I didn't know you had the same car. - I thought you'd traded it in. - Why would I? It hasn't gone 30,000 miles yet. As if I could buy a new car every week! Having an extended family is hard enough. Are you coming, Felix? Yes. Beautiful car. - I told you not to slam the door! - I didn't, sir. Are you calling me a liar? - You didn't do it? - It was an accident. An accident? - It can't have been. - Don't exaggerate. Stay out of this! - I know this good-for-nothing. - That's not fair, sir... Get out! Violeta, come up front. This is all because you spoil your dead husband's son. Hello. How are you? Where's your nephew? Did you forget him? Your friend told him to stay home. Ronnie had to study, honey. I'm going for a walk, alone. As you wish, darling. Do you want to freshen up? - You're not looking so good. - Alright. - Do you like it? - What? My park. It has some beautiful shady corners. It's not as impressive as Rattery's, but... Would you like to see it? Very well. You'll break a heel. That would be a shame. Still angry with me? Are you that fierce with your cat? He's not a dirty beast. And I am? You are unfair. If I were a beast, I'd be bitter about last night. Why don't we make peace? You'll see the peace I'll make with you. - You are so evil. - Let me go! Not me. You prefer that midget you brought to make me jealous. Let me go, I tell you! You filthy brute! Playing around again? Linda wanted to prove she's stronger than me. Didn't look like that, did it? - It could've been just a friendly game. - A game? Then I'll go on playing. She seems a little worked up. Rhoda is waiting at the tennis court. Tell her it's still too hot for me. Alright. That Carpax is priceless. A good business partner and a convenient husband. For you. Very intelligent. I'm beginning to like you. - We'll be great pals. - But not partners. Don't worry. Don't worry. Carpax's property is vast. It's in his name, but it's mine. That reduces the taxes. We have a few such businesses. The noise of the train must be trying. Not really. These lands are a good business now. Their value has greatly increased. They were my father's, before the war of 1914. Careful! It's very dangerous here. You're right. I should erect a fence. Carpax would have seized the chance to be my heir. What is wrong? I don't know. Perhaps I have vertigo. Let's go back to the others. Linda will be waiting for you. I could have killed him! If I don't hurry, someone else will. I'm not the only one with a reason to do it. - Two gallons. - Alright, sir. What were you doing? Shooting at the rats in the garbage. The monsters chewed through a tire. - Why don't you use poison? - Poison? I've filled every corner with strychnine, instead of killing them it only makes them fat. - Where are you going? - To sail Ronnie's boat. - With your step-father's consent? - This man convinced him. How funny, the cat convinces the rat. Your joke didn't amuse Jorge at all. See? The strychnine does nothing. Yet a small amount of this can kill a giant. Believe me, - this is far more practical. - All done, sir. How much is it? - Do you want to try? - Yes. No. In order to Kill, it is important you are calm. Let's see. Take aim. Carefully. Observing well. Now, gently press the trigger. You're ready to kill your enemy. Let's go Ronnie, it's getting late. Have fun! The ropes are over there. A good sailor doesn't treat his sails like that. Anything else? I'm going to tell you a secret. Come. - Down there... - Yes. That's where I keep things Rattery won't let me have at home. You won't tell, will you? - Let's go. - Yes. Very good. That's called being brave. Who said you're a coward? I wish Rattery could see me. Practice, and we'll invite him. He won't come. - Why? - He can't swim. He can't swim? No, he can't. What do you see in her? You haven't looked in the mirror for a long time. You've changed a lot since she arrived. I had nobody to compare you to before. You'll regret this. Will you tell your husband? - Aren't you ashamed of them? - What can I do? What any woman would do, to avoid such sinful behavior. Don't you want me to help? You got very burnt. Felix! The writer doesn't seem very interested. Are you done flirting? I don't want your thing with Jorge to fade on my account. Did you want something? To know what's going on with us. I asked you to come here so that you could help and protect me, didn't I? Yes. What is this about? You're turning into a slave of Rattery's, like poor Carpax. Instead of reacting like any other man, you do nothing. You're wrong. I'm trying to earn his trust. So that he will stop torturing your sister and Ronnie. - Isn't that what you wanted? - I can't take it. - I want to leave now. - We may go tomorrow if all goes well. What do you mean? I hope to make Rattery leave everybody alone. Let's go. - Let him go, Rhoda. - Stay out of it. Coward. Even with the ladies. What's up with him? Rhoda tried to kiss him and it scared the brat. He'll never be a man. He sure is a man. A brave one. Him? No chance. He proved it to me when we were sailing. Bravery isn't needed to go in a little boat. - You're wrong, Rattery. - Please. - Anyone could do that. - You think so? Come with us one day and you'll see it's not so simple. Whenever you like. - Tomorrow? - Alright. I hope you don't wriggle out of it. I don't want to change my character's traits. Which character? It's a surprise I have for you. You're my inspiration for the hero of my next novel. - Really? - Yes, do you mind? Not at all, on the contrary. You should read us what you've written. Not yet. Don't be ridiculous. I propose a game. We each place a bet and try to guess the ending. - Let's go get your notes. - I never show them before I'm finished. - You'll see them later. - As you wish. Rhoda, let's go for a walk. It looks like your bond is getting deeper. I'd like to know what Linda's boyfriend wrote about you. Tonight, I goaded him again. Tomorrow is the day. When we're out at sea, I'll make him stand up. When I manage that, it will be the end of my journey and the beginning of his. You'll look after him? Don't worry, Violeta, your husband will die an old man. Listen, Felix. I still have a few things to do. Why don't you prepare the boat? We'll meet at the dock in half an hour. Did you draw up your will? That's exactly what I must do. - I wasn't being polite. - Am I going too? No. You're staying at home. Don't worry, you'll come with Violeta and me. We're going to the cove. That loafer is not going anywhere. I saw the marks from his last exam. When you return from your outing, we will talk. See you later. What are you thinking, Ronnie? Nothing. I must get into that? You can still change your mind. Alright. Let it be in God's hands. - Where do I sit? - There. It balances the boat. Perfect. Shall we go? Right away. You said this was dangerous... - but from what I see... - Don't believe it. It's more dangerous than you think. I suppose you can swim? No, I can't. What's happening? What are you doing? Calm down. Nothing will happen, relax. Don't panic, you won't drown. Were you scared? I didn't enjoy it much. I feel like getting out and going home on foot. I see you keep your good humor. Shall we go back? No. I want to show them that you don't scare me. I promise you that's not my intention. Are you having fun? Sort of. It must be so nice to steer. - Why don't you learn? - Learn? Come on. Pass me that pole, I'll show you. Before taking the rudder, you must go to the bow. Don't be stupid. You think everything is hard and dangerous. Do you want to try a maneuver? Of course! Do you take me for a coward? Then go to the bow. I'll tell you what to do. I must go over there? - To the front? - Yes, to the bow. To do that, I must stand up. I imagine you won't crawl there. You want me to stand up? Of course. So that your journey ends and mine begins. Don't you remember? Those are the last lines of your precious diary. But you'll never write again. - What? - You heard me. I gave your diary to my lawyers with instructions to read it if I die. That's what I had to do after lunch, before coming here. Seems like the claws have been ripped out of Felix the kitten. He no longer wants to drown me. Don't you wonder why, knowing all this, I still came? Yes. Why did you come? To Kill you. In self-defense. I'm grateful for my alibi, your diary. No court of justice will condemn me. You thought you'd drown me, but now I'm the one who will drown you, - with just one punch! - Careful! If you drown me, you'll soon join me. - You lowlife! - You can't sail. You filthy pig! - Murdering midget! - Sit down, don't move. - You'll pay for this. - This is dangerous. I'll hand your diary to the police. - Don't be stupid. - What? If you hand it to them they'll send you to jail. You killed my son. Yes, I killed him. But you can't prove it. I Know. Nor take revenge. I can't do anything. You'll never be able to do anything. Never can come very soon. Don't come back to my house. If you dare set foot there, I'll kill you! I don't doubt it. You already killed my son. But you couldn't kill me. You are right, you are winning. Shut up, you pathetic fool! I can't stand the sight of you! - Let me out of this damn boat! - Calm down! You'll be fine. Now, I need you to get back alive. - May I help you? - Go to hell! Thus, I saw him walk off to his death. The poison was already in his medicine. He thought he could never come to harm. And never came very soon. Come in. Where's Ronnie? They've no news yet. Could he have done something stupid? Nobody knows how a boy will react in this situation. Could you do me a favor? I'd like you to read this in half an hour, no earlier. - I'd like your opinion on the ending. - Of course. - Thank you for everything. - There's no need. I'm just sorry about Ronnie. I'm going to find him. When I do, I'll leave this place forever. Thank you. Good luck. Where is Felix going? To look for Ronnie. - Will he come back? - No. It seems that Felix Lane has finished his novel. Ronnie! Were you waiting for me? Yes. Why did you do it? I thought I was doing the right thing. If you knew how much harm doing right has done. You think I did harm? Well, it's done now. I came to say goodbye. - You're going? - Yes. But I need you, sir. You are my only friend. Because I'm your friend, I must go. What will I do without you? I taught you to find paths in the waves. To not be afraid. Are you afraid of what's ahead? No. - Promise me you'll be a man? - Yes. It won't be hard, you've suffered already. Go home, now. - Your mother will need you. - What about my letter? Your letter? Who would believe that lie? I was sure that Rattery had read this diary. He fell into the trap. Before we went sailing, I put the poison in the medicine. If it weren't for Ronnie accusing himself to save me, this diary would have been the perfect alibi. And nobody would ever have suspected that the person who killed Rattery was me. Felix! Felix! Felix! He told me that he really loved you. ...AND MAN MUST ALSO DIE, YES, THEIR FATE IS THE SAME ECCLESIASTES 3:19
