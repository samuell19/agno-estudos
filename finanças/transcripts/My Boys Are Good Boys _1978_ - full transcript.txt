[Gun shots] [Sirens wailing] [Screeching tires] [Music playing] [Bell ringing] -Good morning, Tommy. Ok. Morning. Up and at 'em. Ok, let's go. Morning. Ok. Ok, up we go. Up, all the way up. Good morning, gentlemen. Let's proceed. -Your old man coming today? -Yeah. -Hey, that's great. -Big deal. -Yeah, I think it's good. -Why? -Because I ain't had no business in over three months. -Yeah, man beside you maybe get a few bucks out of it. -Hey, Tony. Tony. -All right, all right, all right, let's knock it off. Come on, come on. Move away. You know you're in trouble already. You don't want to make it worse do you? Ok? -Hey, man, whatcha doing? -What are you so nosy for? It's none of your business. -They though they saw me smoking yesterday. -Was you? How could I have been smoking I was in there playing cards with you. -That ain't true. -But it could though. -No. -Chunky, what's wrong with you? -Can't be true because I don't know how to play cards and I wouldn't if I could. Don't worry about it , pokie. We'll cover for you. -Thanks. [Groaning and yelling] [Whistling] [Music -- "my boys are good boys"] [Door buzzes] -I would like to see my son, Tommy Morton. -Do you know the visitor's room? -Yeah. Receptionist (over loudspeaker): Tommy Morton to the visitor's room. -Hey, when you see your old man, get some money for the candy machine. Well, what's wrong with that? -Chunky, you're about the uncoolest dude I've ever seen. -How are you doing, son? -Just fine, dad. Last night me and some of the guys went out and we had a few beers at the corner bar, met some girls. We didn't get in until-- mm-- 5:00 this morning. -Ok, so it was a bad question. Your mother couldn't make it. She's retiring next week. And she has a lot to do at the school before the new vice principal takes over. How's your health been? -You really care? -I worry about you all the time. -Then how come I'm in here. -You're in here because the judge put you in here. -I'm here because you wouldn't vouch for me in court. -It was the fifth time you were in court in the last five months. I vouched for you every damn time. And all you did was turn around and get in trouble again. You don't care about anybody. -I never understood before. Look, I understand now what-- -you said you understood the last time you were here. Your mother and I decided that it might be a good idea for you to stay for a while. -My mother? My mother, huh? Thanks for nothing. I guess now that she's retiring, you can go off and go on vacation. -No. -Why not? You haven't got me to worry about anymore. I'm not in your way. -I'd like to help. If only there was a logical way. -Help? If this is what you call helping me? I don't want it. I'd like to help you, like you're hurting me. -Bye, Tommy. I'm sorry. -Man, did you score any loot from your old man? -No, we didn't get around to it. You know, I'd swear that if I had a gun, I might have used it. -Hey, man, you're talking about your father. -Maybe so, but I'd still like to nail him so good it would hurt him forever. What's it going to take for him to really look at me just once. -Did you hear what Priscilla said? She's getting straight a's in chemistry. -Oh, ah, ha. -Is that all you have to say? -Very nice, Priscilla. -Thank you, Mr. Morton. -Bert, you make me so angry. You don't care about anybody but yourself. -I said very nice. Enough. -It's a whole lot better than that son of yours ever did. -Tommy is your son too, Bess. If you spent half the amount of time with him you spend with her, he'd be ok. -Excuse me, but I'll jump out here. I have to meet my mother at the shopping center. -Goodbye, darling. -Bye, thank you. Mrs. Morton: Why in god's name did you have to say all of that in front of here. -Did you file your report on the riot. -It was not a riot. -Don't tell me. I was almost knocked down. -Why don't you mind your own damn business? -Somebody has got to discipline these little bastards. -There's not one bad kid in the whole bunch. -Listen to him. Now he's a psychologist. -Piece of gun? -Uh-- no thanks. -It's the wax, silly. Ok, the best I could make out is the back fence. It's clear between 9:00 and 9:30. Once outside the wall, they can't see you at the fence. I'll be waiting with the car at 9:00. But I have to drive before 9:30. -Oh, why? -Because that's when the black and white goes by. -Well, you sure did a lot of research, prissy. -Thanks. I'll have everything else we need with me. I'll leave a wrist watch with the guard. Guard (over loudspeaker): Ok, gentlemen, pay attention. You're going to be coming out in a few minutes for lunch. You come out with a t-shirt tucked in. You stand by the door, face the office, and keep quiet. When you're done, you'll be dismissed two at a time. Make your head call and return to your room. Have a nice meal. -All right, this is the deal. Saturday at 9:00 am, we're going to go. But we have to be back by the 2:30 check. Now, Tony and chunky you have to get the key. Now, here you're going to have to chew this to keep it soft. -Golly, man, I can't do that. You had it in your mouth. -Christ, we haven't even started yet and you're going to give me trouble? -Well, gee whiz, I used to eat almost anything. Can I help it if I have a weak stomach. -It won't hurt your appetite none. -Tony, convince him it's the right thing to do. -Ok, ok. -All right then. Pokie, you're going to be the alibi, all right? -Ooh, hey, hold it. You know you're not supposed to run. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, but they're going to choose up sides for the ball game. And I got to hurry. -Ok, ok, go ahead. You know, you're one of the best kids around here. -Thanks. Mrs. Morton: Bert? -Yes? Mrs. Morton: Mrs. Morton: Don't just sit in there and say, "yeah." Come in and speak to me. You know I'm busy. -Amo, Amos, amot, amomas, amotas, amont. -What is it, Bess? -It's just not polite to walk in and speak before you find out if anybody else is speaking. -Excuse me, now what was it you wanted. -Prissy would like to borrow your car Saturday. She's going to see the counselor at ucla, if you're not busy. -Not busy? What kind of a question is that? -She can take you to the garage and pick you up. -Thank you, Bess. [Music playing] -Hey, man, I thought you said it would fit. -It will just hold on. -Come on, plan two, right away. -What's plan two? -Come on, I'll show you. All right here, go buy me a candy bar. -Ok. -All right, you know what the deal is? -Right. -Quick, get the doctor. -Can I help you. -No, no. It just got a little to hot. And I'm letting it cool off for a while. -Well, I'll go get you some water. There's a station about a mile down here. -No, it's ok, don't bother. -Oh, no bother. I'll be right back. -Nosy jerk. [Music playing] -You say he just fainted? -Yeah, he didn't eat for about three days. He's on a diet. -Three days? I would have heard about that. -Well, he did eat a little bit. You know, but-- -foolish, just plain foolish. I'll have to report this to the office. He has to eat. -I'll get in touch with the camp director myself. I'll make sure he eats. -What-- what did you do? -You just fainted, son, from hunger. -Here, eat this before you fall over again. -Go ahead, son, it'll give you a little sugar. Report to the dispensary tomorrow. -Now, one thing we've got to be sure about as that he gets some rest. -Don't worry about it, Harry. I'll take care of the whole thing. It's all right. -Ok. -Now eat it up. -To beats, man. That's all. [Gasping] -What did you do? -I told you I should have done that the first time. -All right, just get his keys. Come on. Let's get him out of here. Christ, why don't you just set up a flare? -It's open. Come on. -Come on. -I can't get up here. -Don't you worry, cute thing. Superman's coming to the rescue. -Hurry! Someone's coming. -Oh, no, I'm going to get shot trying to escape. Don't leave me inside. -Like a little drink, girl? Daddy's going to teach you how to drink. -Hey, where you going? I got your water. -I don't need it now. -Well, then nobody can see you out here. [Moaning] [Music playing] -How can he be sure the truck will stop here? -You shut your mouth. -He should stop within 300 feet of this spot. -Front tire is smoking. Might be lose brake belt. I'm going to stop and check. -They're stopping! -Would someone shove a sock in his mouth? -I can't see a thing. [Coughing] -Pete, look, Bert's down on the ground. -Hey, wait a minute, Joe. -Come on, ain't nobody else out there. Looks like it might be his heart. -All right now, Tony. Excuse me, sirs. [Music playing] -Prissy, you get the keys. -There's only three bags. -Damn it. All right, look, new plan. We're going to take one of the guards hostage and that way we can make the other two do whatever we want. -They'll identify us. -No, they won't. Here, I brought the rope along. We can tie our parkas across the walls inside. And there's already a partition in the front so the driver won't be able to see us. Now, do you have any pins on you? We need safety pins. -I have some clothes pins in my car. -All right, quick, go back and get them. You two guys help me drag the guards back inside. -Did anyone tell him to help his breath while he takes off the smoker? -Why do you guys keep conking me out? -Come on, chunky, off with the jacket. -Why? I like it. -Come on. -Is anybody going to tell me why we're hiding in this truck. -Why? -Ok, chunky, I'll tell you. We're in the truck because there's no money. -No money. Ah. -So we're going to the stores and pick money. -That ain't going to work. -Why not? -Because nobody's going to turn over money over to no kids. -Just give me a hand, chunky, and you'll see. -Well, ok. Wait a minute, you've ain't figure on me going in for the money, are you? -No, just a little help, that's all. -Hey, where are we going to eat lunch. -Do what? -Eat lunch. -We ain't. -If we ain't eating-- -you'll what? -I'm helping. I'm helping. -Prissy, what happens when they reach the lunch stop. -They don't. I've watched them eat. They take exactly 30 minutes while parked in the shopping center. -I'll finish. -Here you go. Wake him up. -Don't turn your head. Now go sit in your seat. -All right, mack, now don't move and I'll explain your problem. We're all cozy here in the back of your truck. You're going to drive around all your normal stops. And the man in the back is going to go out and pick up the money. And you're not going to do anything foolish. Is that clear? Now, there's two other lives at stake besides yours. So don't be a hero. Now, sit up and let's get this thing moving. And don't forget, right behind you the whole time. So if you don't want your friends to get hurt, you'll play it smart. [Music playing] -This is just like a movie, huh? -Tie him up. And blindfold him. Up front. All right, guard, we're coming to the stop. You're going to go inside and pick up the money just like you do every day. You say a word or anybody gets wise, your two friends aren't going to make it through the day. It's an empty gun. It'll keep you safe. -Pete, you're late. -Yeah-- uh-- we had a problem with one of the brakes grabbing and overheating. -You need someone to take a look at? -Oh, no, it's fine now. Thanks. -Is there something else? -Ah-- yeah-- no, it's fine. Thanks. Have a good day. -Sure, thanks. -All right, driver, let's go moving. -Keep it together man, and your friends are safe. -Don't touch it. -I have to check on the hour. -What happens if you don't? -Well, they check with me or they send an unmarked car to check. -Hold it a sec. What do you think? -I think he's bluffing. -Yeah, well, I think he's to darned honest to bluff. -Ha. -Hold it. -Yes. -Just what is that supposed to mean? -Whatever it sounded like and keep your hands off of me. -Are you saying he's a liar? -He's rotten. And he treats your mother like a piece of junk. -Well, she is a piece of junk. She is the lowest. -Hey, I don't know where this truck is going to stop. -Just a couple more blocks and we're a the next stop. -We've got company. -Who's that? -They're security. What do you want me to do now? -Wave at them. -I have to report in, or we'll be stopped. -Do it, but be careful. -732621, time check. Man (over radio): 621, this is headquarters. You're 20 minutes overdue. Report to the captain when you come in. Headquarters clear. -They don't like procedure breaks. We're at our next stop. -All right, guard, this is the next stop. Go on out. Don't make any mistakes. -Hey, you tow guys. If we're going to make it, we have to keep our shit together. Cause it's a long trip to the big house if we lose. What do you say? Are we going to work it out or quit? Let's shake hands. -I'm sorry, Tommy. It's all right, no problem. -This is the lunch stop. -What's that. [Knocking] -All right, tell them to eat lunch as usual. -Eat your lunch as usual. -I'm not hungry. -Then pretend. -You can eat your lunch, if you want. -No thanks. -Hey, ask him if I can have it. -Boy, you better sit your fat ass back down. [Knocking] -It's security. I'll have to get out. -Hold it a second. What should I do. -They can't come in. -Don't forget your friends. -He'll have to let me back in. -Here's a gun. -Hi, Dan. What's up? -That's my question? -You'll have to explain. -Quick everybody down. -What the hell are you up to? -So I was 20 minutes late for check in. There's a first time for everything. -I don't like broken procedures. -Well, damn it, get off my case or I won't have time to finish lunch. -You're kind of uptight, aren't you. I don't believe you. But you better believe me when I say that you are under surveillance. We won't be far away. -They're moving around the back. -Hi, captain. -Hi, Pete. -Just can't put my finger on it. -Walk to the front, looking at the wall. Don't be dumb and identify us. -You ok? -That son of bitch thinks he's smart, but he's got me on his ass. -Ask the driver if that cars following. -Tell me if that car's following. -Ok. -He's following. -Turn on the next corner. -I can't. If I change my route, we'll have 20 police cars closing in on you. And someone will get hurt. -Well? -Do what he says, that's all. -I think I changed my mind. I don't to do this no more. -How many more blocks is it before we make the next turn. -We're here, so it's eight more blocks. -All right, if they follow us after that, we've definitely got a problem. -After the next stop, we're close to our car. We can make it the last pick up. -All right, I want to go up and tell that driver after the next pick up to run a yellow light that the tail can't follow. But he's got to make it look right. Otherwise he's going to get it. -Right. -He's acting kind of funny. -He hasn't done anything different except not call in once. -Ah, he's the smart ass type. I've been waiting for him to step out of line. -What do you need? -Seem kind of nervous, Pete. -It's just that I don't like being followed by people. Not even you. -Ok. -Well, there's nothing in there. Let's go. -At next light, run the yellow. Lose that tail or it's going to get hot in there. -Ok. -Oh, damn. -I thought it was all right to let them go. -Well, i-- I don't really know. But just keep your eye on them. -Now turn that next corner and move fast. -Ok. -I think they turned two cars up. -I saw it. Emergency. Armored car in trouble. -Put them out. -Hit the floor. -God damn it. The traffic. -Hey, hey, old man. Where you running. Get it on. [Screams] [Tires screech] -Idiot. [Music playing] -Those drunken bastards. Wave them off. -The problem is we're on a one way street. [Horns blaring] -Oh, good morning, Agnes. My, my, you drank all of your water. -For god's sake. [Screams] [Music playing] -Start putting it into two bags. Leave the change. What are you doing? -We always need change for the candy machine. -Leave it. We've got to move fast. -Oh, shucks. -I'm being held up. -Get this damn truck stopped. -Stop this damn truck. -Use the spray. -Yeah, right. -Who left the door open? -I was in a hurry and I forgot my mask. -It doesn't matter anyway. Let's go. Put these in. -All right, now we got 30 minutes to make it back before the afternoon shift. -We can make it. [Engine stalling] -They're going to come, aren't they? -That's real bright, chunky. First you go and wreck the battery-- -how's that my fault? -The light stays on when the door's open. Let's get out and push. -I don't know how to start it that way. -I do. You push. -Keep it running. -Move over. -I want to drive. -Move over. -I've got a right to drive. You drove here. -Come on, prissy. Let hims drive. Just get it. -Take it easy, man. -Enjoy. Prissy: Turn up that dirt road. Chunky: Hey, you ain't going to kill me. -Get out of there. You're on the gas pedal. -Chunky. Tommy: Get out of there. You fool. Chunky: Not until he slows down. -I can't. You're on the gas pedal. -Get off the gas now. Tommy: Damn it, chunky, get off the gas. -Oh, shit, watch out. -Come on, chunky. Are you crazy get out of there. [Jeers from the crowd] -First run of three. -Go for it. [Music playing] Tommy: Chunky, get over before you kill someone. Chunky: Hey, where are we? Tommy: Idiot. Chunky: Ow. -We've got 11 minutes to get back to the joint, so floor it. -Get up, damn it. -We can just make it. -Well, you can see how it looks to an outsider. -No, I can't. -You could have given Dan a clue that you had a problem. I couldn't endanger the lives of my two men inside. -You could have changed your route, we would have know. -Just what you say inspector? -There are any number of ways you could have helped us, but you didn't. You spent the whole day with a gang of criminals and you can't give a description. You actually went out of your way to hide facts from qualified police help that was readily available. Wouldn't you say something smells strange. -Inspector, I'm a calm man by nature. Now unless you want to slap me into a jail cell right now, you better change your attitude. -If it disturbed you that much, it must have hit close to home. -Hold it. Sit down. Sit down. I smelled a rat on this job right from the start. All right, let's-- let's go back right to the beginning. Now whoever planted this smoke bomb did it before 11 o'clock. What was your stop before then? -Cable's grocery. -What happened there? -Nothing. -You mean nobody came near the track? -The usual customers, it could have been anyone. -No, wrong. You see the mud was scraped of underneath the Fender. Did anybody bump the truck? -Yeah, yeah, a kid on a skateboard. They like to slap the truck as they go by to get attention. -How old was the kid? -13, 14, curly hair, black. I only saw him for a second. -Marvelous, are you aware that you are paid not only to drive but to observe. -Don't tell me how to do my goddamn job. -Evidently somebody should, you've just been robbed. Maybe. -Sergeant. -Captain. -Book him for a felony assault on a police officer. -Come on. -Hold it. Have him wait out in the hall a moment. Come here. I know you're pissed, but this is just going to slow us up. -I can't let every goddamn crook that comes through here take a free shot at me. -What's more important? This case or your lousy pride? -Who the hell do you think you are talking to me like that? -Look, let's take a breather. I don't like the guy anymore than you do, but i"ve got to have a way to go with him. Give me a break. -All right, I'll defer charges for now. But he's going to do time for slugging me, innocent or not. -Well, you finally did it. You idiot. Your spread all over the front page. -I have had about all I can take for one day. -You've had all you can take? Why can't you think of me sometimes? The phone's been ringing off the hook. -Stop it, Bess. -Don't you dare interrupt me when I'm speaking. I've given you the very best years of my life and I won't be treated this way. -Can it. -What did you say? -Can it. Can it! Can it! -Prissy. -Hi, Bess. I just came over to see if I could help. Knowing what you must be going through. -You have no idea, darling. I just about to talk to Mr. Morton about getting a divorce. -That's the only good news I've had all day. -Where are you going? -Do you care? -I made the car. -Really? Newscaster (over radio): That was real fine. Now here's the news on the hour for all you people out there corral country with wild bill Williams reporting. Yesterday, in a daring daylight holdup, an armored car was robbed of $50,000. Guards were rendered unconscious by sleeping gas and then the driver-- -robbed his own god damn truck. -It's hard to believe, Dan. -I can tell you right now, I'm going to find out the truth. -Would you rather ride in my car? We could talk. -What's the matter with you. He made you in a new car. I'll get out here. I'll have a lite, Willie. -You'll have a lite? -A few Miller's here. -You have bud? -Miller's. -When you guys going to get old enough to drink whisky? -Don't make enough money selling beer? -No, we don't. -Tell me. What really makes sense to you? -First, I think I know the leader of the gang. I mean, I don't know his name, but I think it's someone I know. -What makes you say that? -His voice, he was talking naturally, but then all of a sudden he changed. Like he felt that I might recognize his voice. -And then he didn't speak anymore? -No. -Why didn't you tell the police about it. -I didn't think of it till just now. -Did anybody else change their voice? -No, the guy who did most of the talking, didn't change his. But at one point, he started humming some sort of tune and snapping his in a kind of rhythm. If I heard his voice, I'd recognize it. -Harry's got chunky and he's asking questions. -About what? -Where he got all the change to buy the candy bars. -Chunky always buys candy bars. -Yeah, but man, he bought out the whole machine. Now the other dudes are complaining. They found a whole drawer of candy bars in a drawer in a shake down in his room. -You think he'll tell? -Not today, Jack. -Why not? -Cause he's to sick from trying to shove the evidence. You know, they're thinking about using a stomach pump on him? -Look, you better to get a hold of that fat tub of lard and tell him if he doesn't keep his mouth shut, I'll shut it for him. -Oh, by the way, words out that your old man has been laid out until they find out what's going down the money-- -yeah I heard. -You said that's what you wanted, remember? -Yeah, I did. -Well, what have you been doing all day. You certainly have your nerve leaving me here all day without a car. Oh, i-- I want you to know I'm going to call your son about our divorce. -Now, why do you have to do that? He's got enough problems of his own. -He has a right to know his father's so worthless he can't keep a job. -I'm sure he knows that already. It's not the most well guarded secret in town. -He can come and live with me. He'll get a better life that you have ever given him. -He doesn't want to live with you. He hates you. -How can you see that? You're the one he hates. You're the only one who hurt him. -You hated that child ever since you were pregnant. You should have gone through your plan for abortion. -Shut up. -It's funny. I never realized what pain it must have been for you living with a child who you never learned to love. I'm going to walk. -Mrs. Morton? -Yes? -Dan Montgomery, securities investigation, we'd like to talk to you for a few minutes. -All right, come in, but I'm busy in the garden. -Mind if we sit. -No. -Mrs. Morton, may I ask you for your undivided attention, please. -All right. -These are just routine investigation questions. For instance, have you noticed anybody strange in the neighborhood recently? -No, why? -Well, it's possible that your husband was under surveillance prior to the robbery. -I didn't see anybody. -You know, I didn't notice two cars in the driveway. Ah-- don't you have a car? -It's in the shop. -Why, I thought you worked. -Well, I retired last week. Bert's been taking me to work and picking me up. -And on weekends? -That's the difficulty. Bert that takes his car on Saturdays, so I'm stuck here in the house all day. -Have you two been getting along all right? -What kind of question is that? -Well, dissension in the home sometimes motivates a man to do strange things. -Nothing motivates Bert. -Thank you, Mrs. Morton. I hope we don't have to bother you anymore. We'll find the door. Guard (over phone): Camp giuseppe detention center. -Hi, this is Bert Morton. I'd like to see my son today. Guard (over phone): I'm afraid visiting hours are over for today. -I fully understand that but this is in regard to a family crisis. I hardly know where to start. I'm sure you've already heard about the robbery. Your mother wants a divorce. -Figures. -Oh, I've never really been fair to her. She's probably right. I was tied up in my own work. Well, now let's over. -You'll be able to get your job back, won't you? -I don't think so. I have a felony hanging over my head. The bonding company won't bond anyone with a felony conviction. -Maybe you won't be convicted. -Yes, I will. I did it in front of witnesses. I struck a police officer. -Man, my great, perfect father in jail. That's swell. How about one of your favorite lectures on respect for authority now. -I still believe that. -Tell that to the judge. You'll probably get time for aiding and abetting criminals that robbed you. -My role was totally innocent. Never yell a cop. That makes you a crook. Ask anyone in this joint. -I was protecting others. Say that again. -What? -About not yelling cop. -Why? -How would you know about that? -Rumors spread. -That hasn't been released yet. If you heard something, you'd tell me. -That hurts. -Tell me. -Look, this one is your problem, not mine. Can't you just go away and leave me alone. -You choose a lonely spot. -Well, I feel like that. -You know, I was thinking on the way up here. It's hard to believe. -If I wasn't convinced, do you think I'd hang a thing like this on my own son? -No, I suppose not. But even if it's true, it's still a very tough problem. -We have to find a way. -Now this whole thing has practically no clue, but I still have an edge. -How's that? -Well, kids are lousy liars. They do an awful lot about of it, but not very well it. It takes years and years to become real liars, like us. I'd like to know which boys he pals around with and a little bit about each one. -Surely, let's have Harry come in. He works a lot with the boys. I just see them when they're in trouble. Guard (over phone): Yes. -Have Harry klinger come in here. Guard (over phone): Yes. -Normally, you need a court order to question the boys. You realize any information you receive cannot be used as evidence. -Thank you, I appreciate that. [Knocking] -Come in. Have a seat, Harry. -Thank you. -Ah-- this is Dan Montgomery, armored security investigations. He thinks some of our boys might be involved in the a armored car robbery. -Golly, I don't know how that could be. They're counted every day and night. -Let's just assume some of them were involved. Have you noticed anything strange around here recently? Like last Saturday? -Um-- Saturday? -I think it'll be easier for Harry to talk with me out of the room. He doesn't like to carry tales. It helps to control the boys. They know he's not a stoolie. -Why are you defending these kids? -Well, they have enough problems. -I told you my old man wouldn't let it go easily. -Well, who is this guy in there any way? -I don't know but they got Harry in there asking a lot of questions. -You ain't got to worry. I got you all covered. Like I told you, we were all working with me on the boat. -Yeah, but what to I know about making some old boat. -It couldn't be better. The place was empty all day. I locked the door from the inside. -I don't think you want to get involved in the cover-up. These kids are in trouble and it's their a problem. -Well, it's easier enough for you to talk like that. You've never served time. -Have you? I didn't see a file on you. What were you in for? -Oh, come on, come on, tell me. I'll find out one way or another. -I shot my father. When he beat up mom. I was 10. -How long were you in? -Till I was 18. -Ok, you had you troubles. But these kids are all different. Some good, some bad. There's only one thing they have in common, they cannot cope with society. And no matter how you think about it, they are wrong. -You're right. And the kids are wrong. That's what everybody says to them. You're wrong. Police, narcs, juvies, the nuns, the whole goddamn world is right and the kids are wrong. But you don't care about them. They are people. You're wrong, Harry. That's not right, Harry. Can't you do anything right, Harry? Are you stupid, Harry? Where's your brain, Harry? Mommy and daddy know what's right, Harry, because their mommy and daddy knew what's right. Well, maybe we just ought to ask the kids what's right and wrong. And maybe they would surprise all of us. My boys-- my boys are good boys, good boys. They just need a good father to help them. But my boys are good. Good! -I'd like to-- I'd like to see Tommy, Tony, chunky and pokie. -Thomas Martin, Tony blazer, Arnold O'Malley and Patrick shoenbaum, report to the control center. -This is it, fellas. Let's stick to the story, right? -So, I'll leave you to talk your own talk. -Why don't you boys sit down. Well, it looks like we have a little problem. Huh? Well, my mind about that. Ah-- tell me, do I look to you like a real straightforward guy? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Now would you lie to me? -No. -Well, that's kind of hard to believe. Most people would lie if they find a good enough excuse. You really wouldn't lie to me? -No, sir. -That's funny, because I would lie to you. Well, ok, Mr. Thornton, your administrator, works for me. I work downtown at the head office. And he works out here. Ah-- now, Patrick, I'm told that you were seen smoking. Arnold, you stole some money from Tommy here. One of the guards was tied up here in a closet. And Tony here is accused of that. So there are few more items on my list, but this certainly proves that we do have a problem. Or maybe, obvious would be better. Tommy, do you enjoy working on cars? -Yeah, kind of. -And Arnold? -Oh, yeah. -Doesn't anybody call you Arnold? -No. -Well, Arnold, how about you? What would you like for a hobby? -I can't do nothing. Inspector: How about cars? -Nope. Inspector: How about cards? -Nope. Inspector: Wood working? -No. -All right, all right. You think it over. We'll get back to you. Patrick, I have in my report that you may be winning the crafts awards this year with your boat. -Yeah, they want me to enter it. -Well, that's fine. That's fine. Of course, you realize that if any one of the supervisors or anybody helps you with it, you're liable to be disqualified. --Ain't nobody else touched it. -All right, just as long as you understand that. Tony, I understand your hobby is baseball. -Sure is. -I found out that your batting over 400 in the Saturday league. -Yep. -How did you do last Saturday? -Good. -You know, it says here that no one saw you play Saturday. -Ah-- yeah that's right. I was helping pokie with this boat. -You weren't neither. I built it myself. -Mm, well, we seem to have a disagreement. -I was just watching. -Oh. -We were all just watching him. It was chunky, Tony and myself. -You too Arnold? -Yeah. -Can you explain to me what this boat looks like? -Well, I don't know too much about boats. -Well, I mean, does it have a motor or a sail? -Yeah. -Which is it? -A sail. -Thank you, Patrick. Now, tell me, how long is the boat? Arnold you tell me. -Well, big. -Big enough to get into? -Yeah, I guess so. -Ah, man, it's just a model boat. -Well how was I supposed to know you never told me about it. -So you weren't with Tommy and Tony, hm? -No. -Why did you tie Harry up? -I didn't. -Then where were you? Playing cards? -I told you. I don't play cards. -You played cards with me the other day, dummy. -Oh, I forgot. -And I thought you boys said you were going to lie to me. I really feel bad because of you're lying to me. Arnold, you stand up. You want to know how much trouble you are in? Number one, supplying an alibi for Patrick's smoking. Number two, stealing money from Tommy. Number three, attacking an institute guard with an intent to commit bodily harm. Number four, lying to an official. There, I'm afraid you're going to have to go up in front of the judge again. Measures will be taken. I can assure you of that. You fellas can to go your rooms. [Bell ringing] -Ah, chunky, I brought your jacket back. -Gee, thanks. Hey, how'd you-- -Come on. Go to your rooms. We'll call you. -First of all, the man you're talking to is security investigations. He has you kids cold. He knows who's involved and can prove it. There's no way out. Please, trust me this one time. I know the difference between doing a job and believing what you're doing. I've been your father in name only. I've g you half the love and sincerity that I feel for you. And you responded naturally with half. Now, we may not always agree, things may not always run smoothly, but I'll do my damnedest. We can make a team that can't be beaten. -Prissy's got the money. It doesn't do you any good to deny it, Priscilla. I have all the details. You may be the only one who knows where the money it. But when the police get through with you, you'll tell them. -It would be impossible to prove I had anything to with it. -Just sit down young lady. You take my word for it. I can prove it. Now, if you turn in the money and you all confess, it will go much easier for all of you. -Can Mrs. Morton take me to get the money alone? -Yes. -Ok. -Let's go. -Mrs. Morton? Mrs. Morton: Yes, prissy, I'm in here. -Hello, prissy. -Could you drive me someplace, Bess? -Well, darling, you can have the car if you wish. -I'd like it if you go with me. -Of course. -We have to get the money. He's wise to the whole scam. -Bert? -He doesn't know about you. And I sure won't tell. -Forget about him, darling. We just leave now. Did you bring your passport? -Yes. -Good. And I've taken all the money from our savings. And all we have to do is pick up the other money and go. So what if we are leaving two weeks? -This could mean a lot of trouble for you. -He'd never prosecute me. He's too spineless. -I'd sure hate to see you arrested. -Prissy, we'll be in Europe before he seriously starts looking. He'll still be asleep in his jail. -I'll get the money and be right back, ok? -Hello, is this your car, ma'am? -Yes, yes, it is. -There's no parking here. -Well, I'm not parking. -Looks like you are to me. -Please, don't get smart with me. -Your driver's license, please. This is your current address. -Yes, yes, it is. -Your license expires in three days. -Please, write the ticket and leave me be. -It could creates problems if you don't get it renewed on time. -Yeah but-- -officer. You won't have to wait for your accomplice any longer. We picked her up. She was already leaving in the airport bus. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Oh, yes you do. Remember that conversation we had? My husband always uses the car on Saturdays. You knew your husband didn't have the car and you didn't tell me. Have a look. -Now, I'm going to teach you how to drink little girl. [Music -- "my boys are good boys"]
