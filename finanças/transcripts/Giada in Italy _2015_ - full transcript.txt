Welcome to the magical isle of Capri. I've been coming here since I was a kid, and this visit is extra special. Jade and I are meeting up with family and friends... Cin cin. Beautiful friends. Whoo! ...to cook... Whoop-whoop. ...laugh... Oh, my gosh. It's gorgeous. ...share stories... This was Nonno Dino's pride and joy. ...and honor my grandfather and his amazing life. -Would Nonno Dino be proud? -Yes. Join me for a taste of Capri... Yeah, baby! ...and a celebration of food, friendship, and family. Capri is a drop-dead gorgeous island off the coast of Southern Italy, known for the faraglioni -- three massive rocks that rise dramatically from the sea -- fresh Mediterranean-style food, and a unique sense of style. After all, this is where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was first spotted in her signature Capri pants. It's hard not to be swept away by the glamour and promise of what we Italians call la dolce vita. I've been coming to Capri a very long time. My grandfather has quite a history here in Capri, and we vacationed here a lot as kids. This is Jade's first time here, so I want to share all the places and foods that my grandfather shared with me. When I think of my grandfather and Capri, I think of seafood. I think of pasta. I think of lemons, and so I thought, "I want to create a menu that has all of the elements of the first things I think of when I think of Capri." My Nonno Dino, loved lemons, and so do I, so I'm making lemony crepes filled with sweet, creamy cheese. When he arrived in Capri, my grandfather always made pasta with olive oil. I'm dressing it up with peas and prosciutto. My mista salad is inspired by a stroll through the local market, and we'll kick things off with fritto misto, a fried seafood appetizer that my grandfather often enjoyed with a cocktail during Capri's aperitivo hour. To Capri. The aperitivo hour is something that's very special to Italian culture, but especially here in Capri. It's a place to see and be seen, and the fritto misto is very popular. It can be vegetables along with fish. It's a combo, but everything's very lightly fried. My grandfather really loved that dish. All I really wanted to do on our first night in Capri is give Jade a little taste of what that would be like. It's casual, but it's sophisticated, as well, so it's kind of bringing that world together and giving her a little bit of a taste of it. I'm just seasoning a little bit of fine polenta flour, a little bit of rice flour, and some cornstarch. The mixture is the perfect combination for frying, so just mix that together. So I got some calamari and some beautiful, little shrimp. Look at these guys. We're gonna fry these guys up. Just gonna toss them all. I've already got my vegetable oil nice and hot. And we're gonna get these guys in the fryer. Don't want to overcrowd the oil, so you're gonna fry a little bit at a time. We're gonna add some pistachios 'cause we're gonna make a very flavorful mayonnaise to dip it in. So 1/4 cup of pistachios, some grated Parmigiano -- about 1/4 cup of that. Then we're gonna do some fresh basil. Got to have some fresh basil. It's just the definition of summer on the island of Capri. And then we're gonna do a little bit of mayo. About a cup of mayo. Okay. A little bit of olive oil just to add a little bit of moisture. Then... ...we got a lemon, and we've got some garlic. Just one garlic clove. One garlic clove right in there, a little bit of lemon zest. First day in Capri, you got to have lemon and basil. A little bit of salt, and we're gonna put this all together and whiz it up. Ooh, yeah. Okay, let's see. The fish is almost done. Mmmm! That is good. It's cheesy, and it's got, like, that brightness from the lemon. Look at these guys. Look how pretty they are. Ooh, that's hot. And I just want to top them with a little bit of salt right when they're hot so that it sticks. Alright, I'm gonna start frying up the rest of my fish, and then hopefully, I can start digging in. Jade really has grown to love calamari these days, so I wanted to create something that I knew she'd love -- calamari -- and something else that's an introduction -- the little gamberi, the little shrimp -- that you can fry whole. They have eyes and tentacles and all that, something she doesn't normally get at home. So do you want to try this one... Sure. ...now that they're all fried up? I want to try this one first. Okay. I'm gonna try that one first, too. Okay, so this is a mayonnaise made with pistachio... - Cheers. - ...and lemon. You don't want any mayonnaise? - No. Mm. - Mmm! Mmm. What do you think? Really good. You know what it is? They have a little crunch from the polenta. It's really good. That's what you want it to be. You want it to be super crunchy. Come on, let's see. Brava, Jade. It's good, right? Oh, my gosh. That's really good. Alright. Buonissimo. Buonissimo. Brava. Next, it's pasta time. Can't come to Capri without pasta. Aglio e olio, peas and prosciutto. My favorite. Yeah. It's a dish that reminds me of my grandfather and all the great times we shared in Capri. I can't really come to Capri without making a plate of pasta. My grandfather used to love the aglio e olio and peperoncino -- very simple, also very fast. I just got here. I don't want to spend hours simmering a sauce. I think of Jade, and I think of what she would love, and she loves peas and prosciutto, so if I make it crispy with some salty prosciutto, I get more color, more flavor, and I get my daughter to love it. I'm adding some salt to the water for my fusilli, aglio e olio, peas and prosciutto. This is how pretty they are. Look at that. They're fusilli lunghi, so they make them long and they make them short. Jade really likes them, so I thought, "Why not?" Now, while those cook, I'm gonna make the sauce. Put a little bit of olive oil in the pan 'cause what we're gonna do is, we're gonna fry up some prosciutto. So, I'm adding a couple of other ingredients to really turn it into sort of a full meal. Plus, the prosciutto here is so good. There we go, and we're gonna get it in the pan and start frying it up. Alright. So while that cooks, I'm gonna start on the garlic. So this particular pasta dish takes a lot of garlic. You'll find it a lot in Rome, depending on the region. A lot of people just use whatever's left in their fridge, and they dump it in the aglio e olio. We're just gonna flavor the olive oil in the garlic. Alright. Prosciutto is crispy, so we're just gonna put it right on the plate, just like that. Drain out any of the extra oil. Okay. And more oil. Here we go. So, now, we're gonna take all the garlic, throw it right in there, a little bit of red pepper flakes. Now, if you want it super spicy, you can add more. And peas, glorious peas. And some salt, seasoning it. All you really want to do is create a golden tan on the garlic, and the peas, you're just warming them through. Okay. Alright. Let's see here. Mmm. Perfect. Perfectly al dente 'cause you want to finish it in here. The frying pan is where Italians like to finish their pastas. Parmigiano. There we go. So we're gonna add the Parmesan cheese right to the fusilli. Look how pretty this looks. Okay. Get a little bit of pasta water, put a little bit on top 'cause the pasta water will help create the sauce, and then...some tongs to mix it all together. Okay. Take the prosciutto. Dump it right on top. Mmm! Fantastic. A little more cheese, and my pasta is done. I got to make a mista salad, and then for dessert, some crepes. Jade and I just arrived in Capri, an island in Southern Italy that's near and dear to my heart. We're here for a big family celebration to honor my grandfather. But for our first night, I'm treating Jade to a taste of everything I love about this magical island. Alright, dude. We got to get some stuff. One of the most exciting things when I come here is to be able to go shopping in the markets and just cook with local ingredients. Yeah, right from the tree. These are gorgeous. I always make a mista salad -- a very simple salad using all local ingredients, from lettuce to fennel to pomodorini -- little baby tomatoes -- and making a simple garlic vinaigrette. Instead of croutons, I'm making fried capers. Capers grow like crazy in Capri, and they add a nice, salty crunch to a salad. I fry them for a couple minutes until brown and crispy. Now for the dressing. To make it extra special, I roast a whole garlic head, cut off the top, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, wrap it in foil, and pop it in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes. So I've roasted my garlic, and it becomes really soft, and it becomes super sweet when that happens. Just squeeze it right out. Perfect. Okay. Garlic is in, so to the garlic, we're gonna add a couple teaspoons of Dijon mustard for a little kick. A little bit of salt and extra virgin olive oil... ...and one of these great lemons from around here. Just a little bit of lemon to brighten it up. And here we go. It's nice and thick. Yummy, yummy, yummy. Okay, so the dressing is done. I'll just leave it here. Grab my tomatoes and my fennel. You'll see that, on most menus here in Capri and really all over Italy, make really simple salads. Now a little bit of fennel, and this is really the way I grew up eating salad, super simple. You want to peel it a little bit. There we go. And then slice it up. And I love it. There we go. We'll put that on the salad. I found some great Treviso. Now, Treviso has a bit of a bite to it, and as you can see, it makes for a really colorful salad, but you could do any kind of lettuce that you like. I'm gonna dress it. We'll toss it. Then we'll add a little bit of Parmesan cheese 'cause I got to have a little Parmigiano. Parmigiano. And instead of grating it, we're just gonna do what most people see -- little shavings of Parmigiano over the top. And then, last but not least, we're gonna take those beautiful, crispy capers and just toss them right over the top. They add a nice sort of tangy bite. That's it. Insalata mista is done. It's so pretty. I mean, Jade, this is why we come here. Okay, boo boo, are you hungry? Yeah. It's perfect. Hey, look. Oh, my gosh. Mmmm! It's the Parmesan cheese, baby. Mm-hmm. When you're done, we can go upstairs and make some crepes for dessert. Cool. Cin cin. Cin cin. To the vacation. Mm-hmm. Capri is the land of lemons, and when life gives you lemons, you make a sweet and decadent dessert. Jade and I just arrived in Capri, and one of the first things you notice is the glorious aroma of citrus. It just gives me the biggest smile on my face. Capri is, after all, the land of lemons. They're everywhere and used in almost every recipe. Ciao. So, for the first night with Jade, I'm inspired by a dessert I once had at a local restaurant built under a canopy of lemon trees. I love something that's called delizia al limone, which are these soft, little sponge balls, and they're filled with lemon curd and topped with lemon cream. They take a minute to make, and I didn't want to spend that much time, but I know Jade loves crepes, so I could get the same texture from the crepe that I can get from that dessert that I love. Alright. So let's make the filling. Yeah. Almond mascarpone filling. Yummy. So we've got 1/4 cup of mascarpone in there, 1/2 cup of heavy cream, also known as panna in Italian. Do you want to sprinkle some sugar/zucchero in Italian? All of it? Yeah, yeah, all of it. Okay. And then a little bit of vanilla extract. Do you want to do that? Smell that. Smell how good that smells. Madagascar vanilla beans. Go ahead. Tell me when. Go. I'm just -- Let me. I'm just kidding. I love doing that to you. Okay. Ready? Yep. You want to sprinkle the almonds in there? Sure. So we have some chopped almonds. There you go. Okay, so you just want to fold the almonds into it, and now we've got a nice filling. See? You want to taste it? Yeah. Okay, go. Is it good? That is really good. Yeah! Alright. Let's get started on the crepe batter. We have 3/4 of a cup of flour in here. You're gonna do the eggs? Mm-hmm. So three eggs and 1 cup of milk. I am gonna add a little bit of butter to my crepe pan and get that melting. You're gonna like these Jadey-wadey. -Cool. -Okay? Should I wash my hands in the back? Huh? Yeah, sure. A little bit of sugar. 2 tablespoons of sugar to sweeten it up, a pinch of salt, and a little bit of vanilla extract. Hey, Jadey, will you grab me a lemon, so we can zest it in here? Sure. I'm just breaking up the eggs here, mixing it all together. Just a little bit. Just be careful of your fingers. The aroma is just phenomenal, so we don't need a lot. Okay. The butter's melted. Okay, you ready? Okay, a little bit of the batter right into our buttered nonstick pan. Yeah. There you go. Mm-hmm. Yep, all the way. It might need... Actually, that'll be alright. Grab these. These are our plates. Grab these beautiful blueberries. We're gonna top up with some blueberry, and we've also got some powdered sugar, which is Jade's favorite. And, of course, we also have some melted chocolate, and I think we can flip it. Ready? Ooh. Okay, so why don't you grab the filling. Mm-hmm. And I'm gonna make another crepe for myself. Okay. Alright. So what you do here is you're gonna flip it like that, right? Mm-hmm. You can spoon a little bit more there, and you're gonna flip it again. -Okay. -Okay? Yep. Great. Blueberries around it. And you can top it, yeah, wherever you want. Okay. This is the creative part, Jadesy-wadesy. Look at that crepe, Jade. Beautiful. I want a little bit of this. This. This. You put that, some blueberries. Look what I'm gonna do. 'Cause I don't want powdered sugar. I want chocolate. Oh, my goodness. How is it? I think this is the perfect ending, hmm? Really good. The perfect ending or what? We've had our pasta. We had our seafood. We're good to go. Tomorrow, we have to get some gelato, okay? -Yeah. -Okay.
