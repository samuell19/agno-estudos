[dog barking] [roosters crowing] [spitting] - [Man] How you doing, Scott? - [Man] Hey man, how are you? - [Man] Doing good. - [Man] Charles, I was telling Pedro, I don't think it's settled, I just say pick what you like. There's a couple of small pigs in here. Like you were saying you still want one of these. - [Man] Right. - [Man] There's some couple of good pigs over there, don't be scared to pick a barrow. A barrow won y'alls show last year and I got some really good ones in there. That one wagging his tail fixing to turn around is also good. - [Woman] I like this one. - I like that one right there. - [Man] Which one? - I like the one here, the second one that has the back to us. And then the second one over here. This side. - [Man] That barrow right there. - [Man] Uh hmm. - [Man] She said she like that one. - Okay, that one right there. I think that's the best pig in the whole litter. I really do. He's a monster isn't he? - [Woman] Yeah. - [Man] She's good. - [Man] That will make it. - [Man] Is that the one? - Once you get them home, the main do, we gotta get wormed. And I'll tell y'all how to do that with the safe guard. And that's a multiple day wormer. These bigger pigs will weigh 260 to 270 come October. And that's perfect, as long as they grow, don't get sick or anything. They'll weigh 260, 270. - Hey, Brandon, come look at these, look at those, they're small [laughs]. Oh ah. Hello. Mine's name is gonna be bacon. [pig oinking] - Whoa. - I like this one. - Okay, that's the barrow hog right there, alright. [pig oinking] Pretty heavy, can you take it? [pig squealing] - [Man] That's good, right there, Bob. [heavy breathing] It's gonna be tough 'cause she's not halter broken. She ain't get to be around humans yet. - Hang on, drop it. Right here. - So if I get up behind her, she's gonna go crazy. Maybe she won't kick. Go that way, go that way. That's right. I got her down there. Keep going, harder, harder. [chatters] Just relax, just relax. There you go. [dog barking] - [Man] Oh. - [Man] Alright, hold on. Y'all stay right there. Just be easy, real easy. - [Man] Don't set it lose. - [Man] Just be easy. [heavy breathing] Real easy, we going towards her. Real easy, right there. - [Man] Hey. [clapping] - [Jonathan] We ain't got no lock, the lock's at the house. [folk music] [kissing] [loud chewing] [chain rattling] [folk music] [pig grunting] [folk music] [insects chirping] - Tick, tick, tick, tick. I can plug this in too. She heard that noise, she heard that flickering, she started throwing her head. We'll see how this goes. [whistling] It's okay, it's okay, shh. Come on. It's okay. It's okay. So close. Come on girl, you smelt it, I'm okay. It's okay. See I'm not sure how, like what her signs are when she gets mad. She I'm not sure whether she's getting closer to sell the food or to try to jump on me. It's okay. Well, that's good, at least your hands reaching me. It means you must not hate me too much. [ambient music] Oh wow, we'll try again tomorrow. [birds chirping] - Come on, what's wrong with you? Stubborn turd. Come on, come on. Come on. - Don't turn. Come on girl, come on, you can do it. Now your going. Now your going. Good girl, Aggie. Alright. You're going. - Oh I know she'll go in here, she wants to eat. - [Man] Can only clean one a day, that's-- - I can clean all three. - That's like having one child, you only practicing if you only got one kid. - May get where Tori can end up with some college money and savings out of this deal. - I'm gonna blow it on clothes, nah I'm just kidding. - Oh no no no. - We'll have to get past the 10th grade first. - Them boys of mine did this for 10 years at the county fair and our only goal back then was to make a sale. We didn't care if we won or not, all we wanted to do was to [mumbles]. - Uh hmm. - [Man] That's why my boys never did pig, turkey, chicken, rabbit, or steer, 'cause they knew if they didn't make the auction, daddy was bringing it home and putting it in the freezer. - Yeah, I don't think I'll ever do a steer. - They knew the heifers were gonna come home and make babies. - Yeah, not T-bones. [engine revving] - [Boy] Alright we got it. [water splashing] - That pig drink a lot of that water? - [Boy] This one? - Yeah. No. [water rushing] [pig grunting] - [Boy] Come on. [pig grunting] [whistling] Stop, go this way, come on. - [Man] He's walking pretty sound isn't he? - [Boy] Uh huh, he's hugging up against the fence. Uh hmm. That feel good? Ah, ah. - [Man] He's probably good. - [Boy] Yeah, he's fine. - [Man] We just need to get him comfortable in a new environment. - Here, put this up and take that one down. It's just the glass. - Hmm. A few of my favorites here of course is the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo buckle that Mason won. I believe that was 2010. And then Tate won a buckle in San Antonio this past February and he also received a $10,000 scholarship for that buckle, so. Last May, we had our house broken into, and when we showed up, my wife asked the sheriff, she says, "Please tell me they didn't steal my kid's belt buckles." And he said, "No, they're there." So, she was relieved about that, because you can't replace these buckles. You know, it's a lot of hard work. Early mornings, hot days, cold evenings, rinsing calves, and blow drying. And I couldn't imagine what would have happened if they would have stole these buckles and they didn't touch a single one. So they're still all here. [crickets chirping] - Those are my chickens. We get eggs with these. We don't actually show these chickens. And those are the ducks and things. We use to keep our pigs over there but a hurricane came and it collapsed, so we don't do it there anymore. We don't like to buy our eggs from the store, because it's cheaper just to raise your chickens and get your own eggs out the chicken thing. And most of the eggs they raise at the store, they have like genetic engineering and we don't want to get sick and get salmonella, or anything. So it's easier to do this. [cow bellowing] - [Boy] Shock. [humming] - Ah ah, go out the house. Stupid cow. Move. Get. [piano playing] These are all my ribbons that I won from Brazoria County Fair and I really don't show anywhere else at the moment because we're always busy with other stuff. This is my first belt buckle the I won by myself without the help of my brothers and sister like two years ago. This is one of the first trophies I won about two years ago. It says something on there, oh it fell off. I won it for my breeding champion female, my Limousine heifer. In case you want to know what a Limousin is, it's not a car, and I try tell people this, it's a cow from France, and it's very furry. We have a cooler out there to keep it cool 'cause it's not use to our climate, 'cause we live in Texas, it's super hot. And it's really good. That's why most of the beef you eat is from, like if you eat ground beef, it's from a Limousin cow most of the time. If you want different kind of cow, it'll say it on the package, but most ground beef is from Limousin. Yeah, our cow was the greatest. Don't let nobody else tell you any better. Our cow's the greatest. - [Boy] Might want to scrub those. Looks like everything. Right over here is dad's boar open stuff. We don't know where his rigging is, but we keep a lot of it right in there. All under here is rodeo plaques and posters. And some of these, they're in the album but some of them aren't like this one. They do this at the rodeos and then if you saw the pictures you liked at the end, you could buy them or if you didn't, you didn't have to. And I guess, he got them made like that. Well, I always heard stories that he would ride bulls and that his dad rode bulls. And when I was little, rode sheep, the mutton busting. But I haven't been on a steer or nothing. I sat on one in the chute when I was little but never rode one. That's dad. Oh that's, I'm not sure who the bull is, but that's Chris Shivers. He's the first million dollar cowboy and he holds the record for the most 90 point rides in the PBR. Well, my grandpa, he recorded bull riding tapes. I got them ranging from I think my oldest one. It's '86 and that far, and then I got them all the way up til about '05 I think. He recorded like 10 rodeos on this one tape. And I've use them so much, some of them don't even show a picture anymore, all you can do is hear it. - [Man] You're gonna be able to keep me updated, right? - No, on some of them. Why don't you come in here and tell them? - [Man] You can always just give 'em to me. - I only that one on that brown and white bull. And then the one where the bull jumps out of the pen with Hardy. [ambient music] That's the Alvin Rodeo right now? - Yup. - [Jonathan] Oh you're in this one, I've never seen you in this one. - [Man] Yeah, that's a different pen there. - [Jonathan] Yeah. Ooh. - [Man] This about 1976 right here. That might be me, 'cause I use to hang up a lot. - [Jonathan] I've probably been watching these tapes since I got them when I was like five or six. - [Man] Oh yeah. That's probably where it all started with you. Watching these tapes. [ambient music] [folk music] - I wanna chase that chicken so bad, I wanna chase that chicken so bad. You know I do, I can't. My mom told me not to be irresponsible [mumbles]. These are the show pigs. That's Pork Sausage, say hi Pork Sausage. I don't know the name of that one. Ooh ooh, his name is Pork Ribs. - It's okay, come on. Yeah, she lets me brush her left side, but she won't let me get around to her right side to brush her. And that's the side that needs to be brushed, that's the side the judges look at. See, every time I go to get a little bit over there, she kind of acts up. - Keep it going. [machine blowing] - See that wasn't bad. Huh, that wasn't bad, you did go. [cow grunting] Oh please stop doing, ugh. - To get her over to fair, I have to go take them to get their hooves clipped, get them shaved, 'cause their hair isn't suppose to be this long. Teach her how to walk right, bath house, special way to walk. This one's usually more like use to me, in the pen already, I guess when I come out here. 'Cause I feed him first I guess. [pig oinking] This one's a lot more stubborn. We don't know why. Maybe 'cause she's a female. - This way, come on. Yeah, before I let her on that outside pen or that little round pen we just built in the pasture, she's got to get use to walking around in circles right in here. 'Cause right now she's not really walking in circles. She's just scooting her front end. [folk music] [pig squealing] - Bacon, be quiet please. Get her sister. - I got her. [pig grunting] [kissing] - It's okay. Good girl. Nick, look, you seen that. Good girl, good girl. [kissing] Okay, that was almost my mouth. [spitting] Oh look, there's that little pony. - Is that the one you were talking about? - No. - That's my Chance. - That is? That's your horsey. - That's what I put on [mumbles]. One, two, three. - Hold on, I don't got a hold of him. [laughing] Oh. [laughing] Holding on. - [Boy] That little hair on that pony just flopping. - I can get off by myself. - [Woman] Okay. [clapping] - I got it. You see right when she got on that pony, she kicked it. - [Boy] Yeah. - [Jonathan] Make it run faster. Oh. [engine revving] [insects chirping] - What are you doing covering your head up? [coughing] Come on, you got six minutes. [moaning] Get up. Maybe, okay maybe seven. - It was a full moon last night. - And it's our last day. - It is our last day. - Only have [mumbles]. [laughing] - Yeah, but if I found some more close here pretty soon, he'd probably let me get on something. - Why don't you just go to the [mumbles] winter series? - [Jonathan] 'Cause they don't ever have nothing. All the have is junior steers and senior steers. - [Boy] They don't have bulls? - [Jonathan] Nah, and for the senior steers, you gotta be 13. That's not, nah, that's not. That's a good looking horse. That kid goes to our school, the boy. - [Boy] He does? - [Jonathan] Yeah, he's a team roper. They say he's like 26 in the world for heeling. - In the world? - That's what Kyle Booth told me. I've never asked him about, but that's what I've heard. - Oh there they go. They're so funny to watch [laughs]. They're all running towards them. They're like trotting. - Try to shoot him right behind there ear, right in the neck, okay. Oh this gun's a lot bigger than that other one. - [Man] Okay, you got it. Can you see [mumbles]? - I need the little one, it's too far. - [Man] Yeah, yeah. - [Jonathan] Oh yeah. - [Boy] Get your hand up, don't touch him. - [Jonathan] Oh that's a good one. Oh he touched him. [bell buzzing] - [Boy] No score. - [Jonathan] Dang. That was a good bull, but he was wanting him over that front end. - [Boy] I know. See he wasn't leaning back far enough. - Yeah, and he never took his spurs out, yeah yeah. - [Boy] His feet weren't out. - [Jonathan] He kept them in the whole time. - [Boy] Yeah, you can't just dig them in. You gotta turn them out. - Yeah. - Till you get straight in the next. - [Jonathan] Look everybody's rigging I see is like yours. Mine's all bigger and wider. - [Man] Yeah, yeah. - [Jonathan] Oh yeah, that's a good one right there. - [Boy] He's spinning good. - [Jonathan] Oh. - [Boy] There you go, hang on there. - [Jonathan] Look, he's spurring too. - [Boy] Dang, that's a good one. - He's gonna take the lead right there. - That's a good ride. - Yeah it was. - That's the only good bull I've seen so far, the other ones were crap. - If that one, JT's would have jumped up there and turned back and kicked as high he did, that would have been a good one too. - [Announcer] We're gonna need a drag the arena to set up the pulse, we're gonna start at nine o'clock sharp. - [Jonathan] So is that it for the rough stock? - [Boy] Yeah. I'm gonna talk to my dad. - Is it loaded? - Yeah, all you gotta do is cock it. You good or you want to change chairs? - I need to sit up. I don't see him anymore. - [Man] Can you see through the scope okay? - [Girl] Yeah. [gunshot firing] - [Man] Clean this place out. - [Girl] The walk of shame. [piano music] [engine revving] - I don't know what's gonna happen when he dies. - Yeah, throw him in the dirt. - Yeah, pretty much. - Mags, you got the eyeballs. - Yeah. - Yeah, hmm. ♪ Happy birthday dear Tori ♪ Happy birthday to you [clapping] [piano music] [group chatter] - Of course, gotta hold my hand. [girls screaming] I'm freezing, it's cold. [screaming] - [Tiffany] Dragon, a seahorse actually. You see the seahorse? - [indistinct chatter] - Looks like a giant lion mouth right there. [piano music] [engine revving] [laughing] - I bet you he can catch up to you. [engine revving] Did you talk to that guy? - Yeah, I talked to that guy. - [Boy] What'd he say? - He's like you got to put some goggles on. - [Boy] What? - I need to put some googles on. - [Boy] He told you that? - 'Cause once a bug hits you in the eye, he said it's not only gonna hurt your eye, but you're gonna fall off. He's kind of right there. - [Boy] Yeah. - [Girl] Don't let him go. - Whoa. [laughing] [dramatic music] - [Boy] Oh, yes. [water splashing] [piano music] - [Girl] Come on. [crickets chirping] [door opening] - Good girl, okay, okay. Come on. It's okay girl. Come on, it's okay, come on. Good girl. Come on. [grunting] It's okay, it's okay. - [Tiffany] Now, they're suppose to go like this, at fair time, we start walking the pigs like we walk them in a show ring, which is basically, how my brothers taught me to walk them in a straight line. 'Cause the judges notice them better when they're not acting up. Only up to fifth place get to sell their pigs and the rest of them have to take them home. [pig oinking] - Alright, what I usually do, just start from over here, on the side over here. [clippers buzzing] - Right here? - Yeah, you always want to go against the hair, okay, like that. I think he's looking good. I think he's got enough muscle. He walks fairly well, and that's the main thing is their structure. It's gonna come down to the judge's preferences now but I think we got him about as good as we're going to be able to get him. We'll know next Sunday I think they show, or Saturday. [pig oinking] [wheel barrel squeaking] [door opening] - Chu, chu. Chu, chu, chu. [door closing] [door squeaking] Well, I'm packing for rodeo school tomorrow. Hopefully gonna do good there. I mean I'm not real nervous, as nervous like my mom or something. I mean, I know should be scared but I'm really not. She's heard stories and seen movies of how people can get hurt real bad in rodeo or even die, so it's not too big of a deal to me, but she seems pretty nervous about it. To be honest, it doesn't even feel like I'm going tomorrow. It just feels like it's gonna be a normal day. I'm pretty sure once we get there, that'll be different. - How y'all are doing today? - Fine. - How you doing young lady? - Good, how are you? - Good, good. - How's Cheryl doing? - She's doing really good. - Good, good. - Very, very good. - They've got her entered in a commercial show and the buyers will payout more money for bred cattle. They'll pay a couple hundred dollars more for one that's bred. Judges like to see them bread at her age. So we'll find out. - [Tori] Your next Aggie. Moment of truth right here. You better have a baby in there. Come on Aggie. Come on Aggie. - [Man] This one here, could be 34 days. - We got that [mumbles], ultrasound. This is the horn and ears right there, see that little. That's the whole uterus right here. Yeah, she's not pregnant. She's not bred. [engine revving] [insects chirping] - [Girl] [Mumbles]. [water splashing] [laughing] - [Girl] Hit my face. [laughing] Don't look now. [laughing] - Who came up with this idea? - Both of us. - Oh. - I called it a hillbilly slip and slide. - It's not a hillbilly slip and side. It's a ghetto slip and slide. - Ghetto slip and slide. Is that any better than a hillbilly slip and slide. - Yes, 'cause ghetto ones have rips. - Okay, sorry [laughs]. [water splashing] - [Girl] Sorry. [laughing] - We weren't looking to adopt. Like I said we have three children of our own. It's not like our house wasn't full but my husband has a half sister and was told that her granddaughter had just given birth to a child. And I said, impossible, she's what, 12, 13 years old. He said, "Well, she doesn't want to be a mother "and so she's putting her up for adoption." [ambient music] [water splashing] You know I always say you can't choose your own children but we chose her, and I'm sorry, I'm getting real emotional. And to me it's like she chose us because people ask us like, why would y'all take another kid? Your kids are so big. And I always felt like she was a gift from God. [ambient music] [horse galloping] - Whoa, whoa. - [Mumbles] we have a rope. - Yeah, get you a rope and start twirling first. - Okay. - Learn how to handle your rope. [water splashing] - I asked about her a lot and they told me a lot of stories and it made me mad at her because I didn't know I had a sister until two years ago. That she knew she had me and she couldn't take care of me. But she went out and had another child and couldn't take care of that child and gave that child away too. And it made me mad because if you know you can't take care of children, you shouldn't have them. I mean, I know how some children complain like oh my god, my mom is like da da da da da. So I really don't want to complain. Like if I could stay a teenager forever, I would. And they're like I want to grow up. I don't want to grow up, I'd rather not. The real world scares me. There's too many crazy people out there. I want to stay in my own sheltered little box and not have to come out. [ambient music] [loud clicking] - Have to do all that, just stay in the air and learn it. - Have you done this before? - No, it's my first time [laughs]. How old are you? - 19. What about you? - 15. - So a freshman. - Yeah. - We're gonna give you every chance this weekend but you are not in shape to do this. - Yes sir. - And we don't have any magic potion to fix that. That's something you're gonna have to bow up and decide if you want to take care alright, 'cause you can't keep until you get in a little better shape. We're gonna get you fundamentals. But you're gonna leave here with knowing more than your body can execute. - Yes sir. - And that's our goal this week. Get you all the information we can, try to get a little foundation in you, but you can fix it. - Yes sir. - We'll work with you. - Yes sir. - Guys, this is very important, okay, we're going over the foundation of how you're gonna ride your bulls. Okay, it doesn't change for anybody, okay. All of y'all almost, whenever you leave the bucket chute, you're gonna want to tend to this right here. Come back, your feet are gonna float forward and you're gonna fall off the bat, okay. It's 'cause you're not getting ahold with your feet, you're not mashing, you're not lifting. You've got to ride that bull. You ride this thing like it's a bull, y'all see me, I'm not playing whenever I ride this thing. Okay, I'm not just getting up here going, oh wow this is fun. Okay. This is a bull to me. If I ride this like a bull, I'm gonna ride that like a bull. Here, ready to go. Alright, whistle blows. [loud squeaking] [loud banging] Okay. Good job. Drive up over it, get on your butt, get off your butt. I just want to make sure, here we go. Okay, whistle blows, whenever you're ready. Fire now, okay. There you go, keep going, move. Okay, who's next? Right here. Get on there. Get up, you're good. Alright then, [mumbles]. Okay, right there, keep your chains up. Nice and easy, we're just gonna go up and down. See what happens. Slow your trailer down. There you go, you see the difference? You feel the difference? - Yes sir. - Okay, gotta breathe a little bit, okay. Ride on over, there you go. Alright, here we go. Slow down for a second. I want you to slide over, just, no, watch your free hand, keep it square. Okay, now shuffle just your hips. Okay, see how that works? Shuffle your hips, there you go. Okay, you're always riding it. Always riding, there you go. Okay, slow it down, slow it down. Whistle blows. Yeah, yeah, okay. [clapping] Alright, hey, you really got to look, Jon, where you looked is right here. And I can see, I mean, this is, I think this it. Not a good spot, okay. Always warm up, stretch, warm your muscles up. Kind of jump up and down, kind of get ready. Kind of be moving, thinking about, start warming your body up 'cause those bulls, half the time they don't know oh no, we got to slowly go into it. It's a hundred percent as soon as that gate opens, okay. [dramatic music] [bull digging] Put a lot of pressure on your knee, this is cowboy up, okay, go. Come on, come on. - [Man] Let's go boy. [cowbell rattling] [whistling] - [Man] Hey. Oh. [dramatic music] [bull grunting] [cowbells rattling] - [Man] Okay, Jon. - Put your right foot on there, now. The other side, right side. Left foot here, straight down buddy. Now, scoot back. Put this foot, down, down, Jon. This foot down over here. Right in place on the knee. [dramatic music] [cowbell rattling] Hold it, put your hand, now set it right there flat. This is what controls that. [dramatic percussive music] Got your heels lined up with your belt? - Yeah. - Okay, stand on your feet. Put your butt up on your hand. Get ready go. [cowbell rattling] - [Man] Feel that rope, buddy. [loud grunting] [cowbell rattling] - [Man] Guys, open that gate for me please. - Right, nobody but me going choo. - [Man] I told you everything was gonna be moving so fast, you ain't gonna be able to think about everything. - [Boy] Yeah I know. Leaving that looks pretty good, and then that second jump, see that one looks good and then burmp, he got my outside foot. - [Man] Hey, most important, when they take your rope, there ain't nothing you can do unless you got some like cat-like balance. - Are they gonna let us get on more? [folk music] - [Man] [Mumbles]. [folk music] - Everybody wants to win, you know what I mean, so that's the way we go in. Just think that we can win. Every kid has got that attitude. You know, as long as we do what we suppose to do and hopefully, we'll come out a winner. I got to get this one back through, I gotta get that pig back where she needs to be. - Okay, I gotta go cook and get some drinks. - Huh? - [Girl] I'm gonna cook and get some drinks. - Yeah. - [Girl] What you need? - Soda. - What kind of soda? - Lemon lime. [easy listening music] - Check check, mic check. [easy listening music] - Whoa Nelly. - [Girl] Come on. - [Tiffany] Let me feed him real quick. - [Man] She gotta weigh them to see what they weigh. - [Tiffany] Uh hmm. - [Man] Then once we weigh them to see what they weigh, then we know how much to feed them, 'cause we don't want to go over. - Chu chu chu chu chu, excuse me. [water splashing] [easy listening music] [cow grunting] - Dear heavenly father, we're mindful, many blessings that you have bestowed upon us. As cowboys, we live life of hard work. Long days, restless nights of unspoken faith. At the end of the day with our tethered hearts and our challenged hands as we lay down in you, ask for forgiveness. Lord, tonight, as we start our rodeo, we ask that you not only watch over our attendance, we also that you watch over [mumbles] and folks may stay free from injury. [clapping] - [Man] Good morning ladies and gentleman, like to welcome you to our 2013 travel heifer show. [Mumbles] judge again today. Been with us for several years. Our first class in the ring is gonna be class 802, so this will be your last last in half, class 802, that's gonna make these calves 12 to 15 months old. - Slow down Aggie, slow down Aggie.

Last in half all the females, 18 to 21 months. - [Man] [Mumbles]. [Tiffany] How much can it weigh? - Too many. It can't go, once you get out there, take him, and come to the judge. That's what you want to do. You want to come to judge and [mumbles]. [pig oinking] [loud cheering] - How are you girls? - Good. - Alright, ready to go. - There you go Piggy, come on, you got it.
