[LAUGHS] I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY HANDS OFF YOU THE OTHER DAY. YOU LOOKED SO DELICIOUS. I WANTED TO EAT YOU ALL UP. I'M NAKED, BEN. I'M NAKED AND BEING SO BAD. PERHAPS YOU OUGHT TO SPANK ME. I PICKED UP SOME OLIVES FOR YOU, BABY. SOME BIG, SOFT, JUICY PITTED OLIVES. PINK PIMENTOS. Man on tape: IT'S LIKE YOU'RE NOT DOING IT TO BE SUCCESSFUL, YOU'RE NOT DOING IT TO MAKE SOME MONEY, YOU LOVE ALL THOSE ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT HAPPEN. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU LOVE, AND IT GETS YOU UP EARLY, IT KEEPS YOU UP LATE, AND YOU NOTICE THINGS, AND YOU HAVE AN IMPACT, AND YOU HAVE A SENSE OF CONTRIBUTION, AND LIFE IS REALLY JOYOUS. AND MOST PEOPLE NEVER EXPERIENCE THAT BECAUSE THEY NEVER FIND THEIR REAL DRIVE. THEY'RE CAUGHT UP IN MAKING A LIVING INSTEAD OF DESIGNING A LIFE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REALLY WANT, SO THEY DON'T REALLY TAP IN TO THEIR DRIVE. THEY DON'T DISCOVER WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF... Woman in sync with tape: BUT I REALLY GET YOU TO FOLLOW THROUGH AS MUCH AS I CAN BY TEASING YOU AND PUSHING YOU AND GETTING YOU TO TAKE THE LITTLE STEPS. AND AS YOU BUILD ONE STEP ON THE DAY BEFORE, ON TOP OF THE NEXT DAY, ON TOP OF THE NEXT DAY, AT THE END OF 30 DAYS, YOU'VE MADE A HUGE CHANGE. Man on tape: IT'S A GREAT SENSE OF PRIDE, HONESTLY, BECAUSE I KNOW WHERE I'VE COME FROM. Woman in sync with tape: I STARTED OUT IN A LITTLE 4-INCH-SQUARE BACHELOR APARTMENT, FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF, THINKING NOTHING COULD CHANGE, FEELING MAD AT THE WORLD AND MY PAST. UM, BUT FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO CHANGE, AND THE CHANGE CAME FROM NOT BEING WILLING TO SETTLE FOR THAT ANYMORE, KNOWING THAT INSIDE I WAS MUCH MORE THAN WHAT I WAS LIVING, MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY AND SPIRITUALLY, AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND MY PASSION. Man on tape: THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE HAVEN'T DONE-- THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REALLY WANT SO THEY DON'T REALLY TAP IN TO THEIR DRIVE, THEY DON'T DISCOVER WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF. Woman: SO THAT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE THE CHOIR PRACTICE I THINK NEXT SUNDAY. Man: OH, SANDRA! HOW'S THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS? Sandra: OH, FINE. ARE YOU LOOKING? NO, NO, NO. I COULDN'T BEGIN TO AFFORD THE KIND OF HOUSES YOU HANDLE. NEITHER CAN MOST OF THE PEOPLE WE SELL THEM TO. I BROUGHT YOUR SHEET MUSIC. FOR THE FUNDRAISER? GREAT! WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THEM UP TO BEN? OK.

Woman: ICON-AGE, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND ADVERTISING. ICON-AGE, HOW MAY I HELP YOU? ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. GOOD MORNING, MR. DUNMORE. WHAT? GOOD MORNING. OH, MAYBE FOR YOU. ICON-AGE, HOW MAY I HELP YOU? Man: IF WE COULD HAVE A LEGACY, WE WOULD WANT IT TO BE THIS. WE WOULD WANT PEOPLE TO SAY, "OLYMPIA HAS REUNITED GOLFERS WITH THEIR SHORT GAME." THAT WOULD MAKE US HAPPY... OH, GOD, JAKE. GOOD MORNING, PEGGY. DEAR PEG. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU FELL OFF THE BACK OF A TRUCK. THANK YOU. YOU LOOK LIKE AN ANGEL. THE MEETING STARTED 15 MINUTES AGO. DAMN. AM I ONLY 15 MINUTES LATE?

MIKE--THE SENATOR WAS TIPPED TO HEAD THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. Mike: THAT'S RIGHT. KEVIN? HOW ABOUT HE'S QUIETLY TURNING DOWN THE OFFER TO BECOME COMMISSIONER OF BASEBALL? HE'S NEVER EVEN SEEN A GAME. GARY, WHAT HAVE WE GOT? OK, WELL, HOW ABOUT, UM-- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, GARY? UH--GARY, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? GODDAMN IT! WHAT THE HELL? WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOMETHING THAT HUMANIZES THIS BASTARD! I HAVE--SORRY. UM, FROM 1993, ACTUALLY, HE'S SAYING THAT MRS. LASSITER HAS BEEN FIGHTING BREAST CANCER. NOW, THAT'S GOOD. THANKS.

BRADLEY, WHAT SET HIM TO DRINKING? HE, UH... HE LOST HIS CENTER. I DON'T KNOW WHY. WHAT STARTS ANYBODY ON THE SAUCE? FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, MARITAL PROBLEMS, STRESS, POOR SELF-ESTEEM, EMOTIONAL TRAUMA, GENETIC IMPRINTING. HE WATCHES TOO MUCH DAYTIME TV. Woman: LIKE I SAID, BEN HAD OUR STANDARD LIFE POLICY, WHICH WE PROVIDE FOR ALL OUR EXECUTIVES: $2 MILLION COVERAGE... WITH A DOUBLE INDEMNITY CLAUSE FOR ACCIDENTAL DEATH. THAT'S $4 MILLION. WHO'S THE LUCKY BENEFICIARY? SINCE HIS PARENTS ARE DEAD, JAKE WOULD RECEIVE THE ENTIRE ESTATE. [GLASS SHATTERS] [WOMAN SCREAMS] WHAT'S HER DEAL? HER NAME'S PEGGY BLAINE. EASY, EASY.

WELL, I DO. WIPE YOUR MOUTH. WE TALKED TO JAKE LAST NIGHT. HE DIDN'T KNOW HIS BROTHER GOT MARRIED. WE HAD JUST GOT BACK FROM LAS VEGAS WHEN JAKE CALLED. JAKE CALLED? ARE YOU SURE? YEAH, I THINK SO. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE. UH, BEN ANSWERED THE PHONE. MAYBE IT WAS SANDRA. I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME ALL THESE WEIRD QUESTIONS? ARE MY QUESTIONS WEIRD, DETECTIVE ROLLINS? RUDE MAYBE, BUT NOT WEIRD. THEY'RE NOT WEIRD, SEE? DIDN'T YOU GET SUSPICIOUS WHEN BEEN DIDN'T RETURN TO THE HONEYMOON SUITE AFTER HE WENT TO SEE JAKE? UM, WELL, WE... JUST HAD OUR FIRST FIGHT. JUST STUPID STUFF, AND, UM... THEN I WENT BACK OVER TO MY PLACE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT... THAT HE WOULD COME OVER... AND APOLOGIZE. [SOBBING] I'M SUCH AN IDIOT! THE LAST WORDS I SAID TO HIM WERE IN ANGER. MA'AM... IT'S ALL RIGHT. HIS SOUL IS WITH GOD, AND HE KNOWS THAT YOU LOVE HIM. Jake: FUCKING BEN! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE. Sandra: OH, HONEY, CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? GOD, HE RUNS OFF AND MARRIES BARBIE DOLL, AND HE'S FUCKING YOU NOT 3 WEEKS AGO. JAKE! WHAT? THE PLAN WAS TO GET RID OF BEN, NOT TO HAVE YOU SLEEP WITH HIM EVERY 3 MINUTES. YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD NEVER MENTION THAT AGAIN. I DID THAT FOR YOU, I DID THAT FOR US. MAYBE I'M NOT GETTING THROUGH TO YOU, SANDRA. BEN DIED WITHOUT A WILL. HIS ESTATE HAS TO GO THROUGH PROBATE, IT'S A STATE PROCESS. I CAN'T CONTROL IT. YOU KILLED HIM FOR NOTHING.

WHO IS IT? RITA POMPANO. Sandra: YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT JAKE AND PEGGY WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR? Pompano: THAT'S RIGHT. Rollins: MA'AM, THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN AT THE GAMBLING-ON-LOVE CHAPEL IN LAS VEGAS. YOUR HUSBAND AND MISS BLANE WERE MARRIED THERE UNDER THE NAMES BEN AND PEGGY DUNMORE. MY JAKE... [SOBS] THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. THE NIGHT THAT BEN WAS KILLED, WERE YOU HERE? YES. I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT. AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH? YES. I WAS IN THE KITCHEN, MAKING A CASSEROLE. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE MAKING CEVICHE. RIGHT. CEVICHE. YOU SURE, NOW? CEVICHE? I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. JAKE HAD AN AFFAIR. MRS. DUNMORE, WE THINK THAT YOUR HUSBAND PUSHED HIS BROTHER OFF THAT BALCONY. WE THINK THAT HE CONSPIRED WITH PEGGY BLANE TO KILL HIS BROTHER FOR THE INSURANCE MONEY. JAKE IMPERSONATED HIS BROTHER, AND BY MARRYING PEGGY, HE TOOK THE SUSPICION OFF HIMSELF. THERE WAS NO MOTIVE FOR THE CRIME BECAUSE PEGGY GOT THE MONEY. HE WAS ALREADY MARRIED TO ME. MA'AM, I KNOW THIS IS TOUGH, BUT... WE FEEL THAT JAKE AND PEGGY WERE PLANNING ON KILLING YOU, TOO. LUCKILY FOR YOU, THEY DIDN'T LIVE TO CARRY OUT THAT PLAN. THIS IS...IMPOSSIBLE. M-MY HUSBAND... WOULD NEVER CHEAT ON ME! [SOBBING] HE LOVED ME. HE LOVED ME. YES, MA'AM, IT'S GONNA BE OK. YOU JUST...HAVE YOURSELF A GOOD OLD CRY. DO YOU THINK SHE'LL EVER COME TO ACCEPT THE TRUTH? WELL, SHE'S GOT 8 MILLION BUCKS WORTH OF TIME TO SWALLOW IT. WHY WOULD ANYBODY EVER CHEAT AND CONSPIRE ON A WOMAN LIKE THAT? HEY, ROLLINS, WHY DON'T YOU HEAD BACK TO THE STATION? I FEEL LIKE TAKING A WALK. YOU SURE? YEAH... YEAH, I NEED TO CLEAR MY HEAD. WELL, EVERYONE NEEDS TO FIND THEIR OWN HOMEOSTASIS. ROLLINS, WHAT'S YOUR FIRST NAME? NATHANIEL. GOOD WORK UP THERE, NATE. WATCH YOUR HEAD. GO ON. [ENGINE STARTS] [KNOCKING] Sandra: JUST A MINUTE! [KNOCKING CONTINUES] [SOBS] I'LL... I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. I'M SORRY... CUT THE CRAP, HONEY. YOU'RE WASTING GOOD MASCARA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PISSIN' IN YOUR CORNFLAKES. THAT EARLIER STORY, THE ONE ROLLINS ALSO TOLD OUR CAPTAIN... THAT'S NOT THE REAL STORY. YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE TRUTH, DON'T WE, SANDRA? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. OH, COME ON. IT'S JUST YOU AND ME NOW. WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOU AND JAKE KILLED BEN FOR THE INSURANCE MONEY. I JUST THINK IT'S TIME WE TIED UP ALL THE LOOSE ENDS. I SEE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CALL YOUR SUPERIORS. [POMPANO SIGHS] AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO CALL YOUR BLUFF. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? I THINK YOU KNEW ABOUT JAKE AND PEGGY. I THINK YOU FOUND OUT AND DROVE 'EM OFF A MOUNTAIN. I THINK YOU DID THEM BEFORE THEY COULD DO YOU, AND IN THE PROCESS... PICKED UP $4 MILLION OFF JAKE'S LIFE INSURANCE POLICY, NOT TO MENTION THE 4 YOU'LL MOST LIKELY GET FROM BEN'S. WHERE'S YOUR PROOF? PROOF...I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. PROOF. YOU THINK SOMETHING LIKE AN A.T.M. RECEIPT FROM A MACHINE UP IN HEMET THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT MIGHT QUALIFY? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. Pompano: REALLY? OH. WELL, THEN, UM... HOW ABOUT... THIS? SO? YOU KNOW, I FOUND THIS IN AN ABANDONED COUGAR DOWNTOWN. MATCHED THE MAKE OF A CAR SOME OLD WOMAN SOLD TO YOU... OR, AT LEAST, SOMEONE IN A RED WIG WHO LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU. THEY TELL ME THIS MYSTERIOUS RED-HAIRED WOMAN PAID CASH FOR THE CAR BUT THEN HAD TO USE THE A.T.M. MACHINE AT A LIQUOR STORE. Pompano: THAT'S A BIG BOO-BOO. YOU JUST DON'T GET IT, DO YOU, SANDY? OH...YOU SEE... EITHER THE WORLD'S RIGHT-SIDE UP OR UPSIDE DOWN. DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT. I MEAN, CLOSE THE BOOK OF RULES, AND THERE'S JUST PEOPLE CAUGHT IN SITUATIONS. LIKE YOU AND ME. SO, WHAT DO YOU WANT? [TV PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] I WANT WHAT YOU WANT: A PAYOFF. A NEST EGG. A CHANCE TO GET OUT OF THIS RAT RACE. YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT THE OTHER HALF OF MY SANDWICH? I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU. YOU SHOULD EAT SOMETHING. HAVE A LITTLE BREAD, SOMETHING...A LITTLE BITE. COME ON, TASTE THAT. OH, BOY. YOU'RE STUBBORN. YOU KNOW, AT FIRST, I THOUGHT... WHAT THE HELL... TAKE IT ALL. [CRYING] [CHUCKLES] BUT THEN, NOT BEING GREEDY LIKE SOME PEOPLE I KNOW... I MEAN, AFTER ALL, YOU DID DO ALL THE WORK, EVEN IF A LOT OF IT WAS ON YOUR BACK. SO I FIGURE, UM...HALF. 50-50 SPLIT, RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME, YOU KNOW. BUREAUCRACY, PAPERWORK, ALL THAT... INSURANCE COMPANY BULLSHIT. I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. [SIGHS] BUT LET'S--LET'S GET ONE THING CLEAR, OK? DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT FUCKING ME OVER. DON'T LEAVE TOWN, DON'T PUSH ME IN FRONT OF A BUS, DON'T DO ANYTHING... BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN MY BAD SIDE YET. OW. AND I'VE GOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE IN MY LOCKER TO PUT YOU IN THE GAS CHAMBER. OW! SO... I GUESS HALF IS BETTER THAN NOTHING. YES, IT IS. YOU KNOW, SANDRA, A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND YOU SCARY, BUT I LIKE YOU. THE WORLD'S FULL OF BULLSHIT. YOU DON'T BULLSHIT. I LIKE THAT.

MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY REALLY WANT, SO THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO TAP INTO THEIR DRIVE. AND THEN THEY DON'T DISCOVER WHAT THEY'RE REALLY CAPABLE OF. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF. [LAUGHING] I FEEL I HAVE SO MUCH TO GIVE. HEY! YOU'RE UNDER ARREST. I'M--I'M SORRY. I COULDN'T RESIST. I SAW YOU TWO WALKING, AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT... [LAUGHING] OH! I...WOW! YOU'VE...
