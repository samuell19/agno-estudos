November 25th, 1991. Remember what day was it!? "Thalapathy" was released that day. It's obvious when it's Superstar's film. The entire city was celebrating the release with joy. But I... ...was waiting to come in to this world. Go faster. It's crowded, Sir. -Hey where do you think you're going? -There's a woman in labor. Let us go... Hey, they're headed to hospital let them go. It wasn't just "Thalapathy", it was my release as well on that day. Ahh...in spite of space around him, he's been moving restlessly in zig zag direction... ...that's my Dad. Instead of worrying on when I'll be born, he was more worried on when he will be relieved of his duties once I grow up. -Clear this bill at the counter. -Ok! Poor thing, got married really late. Mother! Can't you just shut up, labor pains will hurt. The child will be born soon. Can't you see two patients in pain just like you? I'm still looking for this Nurse... ...her attitude is incorrigible. But did you listen to what she had mentioned? That there are two patients next to her. Here... ...this is my friend Raju in her womb. And this is my friend Mani in her womb. It's said that you're twins, if you shared the same womb. But are friends, if you're born in different wombs. That's us! "Do you know what friendship is?" Good morning...sit down. The test which I had conducted couple of days back, everyone has cleared it. Except for Three dull heads. I'll read out the names of those Three dull heads. Can you please stand up? Dull Head #1 Shivakumar! Dull Head #2 Raju! Dull Head #3 Manikandan! Hey Mani...! How's that, all you three have committed the same mistake stating "2+2 = 22?" I wasn't sure if "2+2 was 22"... ...I wrote exactly what my friend wrote on his paper. If he had stated "222", I would've written the same... ...'cause he's my friend. Show me your hands, why are you guys playing in the rain? Go...get inside the classroom, go! Hey don't you smile, while I'm caning you. Don't laugh, get lost. Only after she mentioned it's a punishment, we realized that it was one. What else do you expect, we became the outstanding students forever. That was our attraction. This is Ramanan brother. He's one of the big businessman in our area. A very good person. But he rose to be our enemy, due to his scoldings. -Greetings Brother! -Hmmm. Greet your Teacher instead, at least will manage to get through your exams. Three Musketeers to guard the wall! That was it... ...we did just like he said until we cleared our 9th grade. But during the 10th grade... ...we got tangled. We offered all our greetings to the God, and went straight to the exam hall, leaving everything to him. It's not enough, just us sitting inside the exam hall, it's quite important to see who's sitting next to us. Hey! Why are you crying? I didn't study for the exam... Hey...Hey! -Start copying from this... -It isn't visible Last Ten minutes left. Sir! Hey... ...that's my paper. Hey...that was my paper! Soon...hurry up! That's the end of it. Failed the 10th grade. Regardless of multiple efforts we couldn't get through the grade. The belief on studies was lost just as it was for girls. We were there for each other. Hey, what's it? It's been two weeks since your father's death. And you're still sulking about it? Hey, just let it go. Fine, how did your father die? -You're asking, as if you don't know... -Just tell me... It was due to Stroke... Was it two stroke or four stroke? Damn it, how can you be kidding about my father's death... What else do you expect? Laugh...keep laughing. You begun to sit here when you guys failed the 10th grade... That place collapsed due to your weight, still you continue to laugh. It's just been two weeks since your father's death, are you laughing 'cause you're happy? You guys will never prosper. Hello, one moment. Can I borrow Rs.20,000/-? Are you planning to head for honeymoon with your dead wife? Get lost, don't you have any other business? What will I do? -Oldie, one moment. -He's sad it seems. What's it? Last week......wasn't you, who cooked for Shanmugan's wedding? That's right. -It was delicious. -Thank you dear. Why do you have to put up with him? Weddings keep happening in the city. Why can't you do it yourself? There may be many weddings... ...but he gets called for most of it. That's why I'm working under him. If there's a wedding, he's the King of it. Let him be the King of it, but why can't we at least be a soldier? But we came to our senses quite late. You can say, it took us Seven and a half years. It's better to have experience to start a new business. But it was just a little hard-work and brains with us. Moreover our friends... ...will be there for us like a safety net. It's our life's first job, hope the database is right? I have more, than what you do. I've covered the entire area. Everybody... ...which area did you go to? Can't you figure, he went to the Moon. Hey! It's 'cause, database might get wet. I've always worked when I'm wet... ...I meant, to showcase my skills. -I'm a proud worker. -Keep that inside. Seriously you call this a job? It's going to be our job here on. Ok, what's next? Next is funds and space to start. -Bloody shit. -Don't know how to go about that. Why not ask your father for it? Mani just shut up. He's as good as dead to me. Mani!? Will your father had helped, if he was alive? My father had a golden heart. Even when he was on his death bed, he gave me a small suitcase before he passed. I was surprised just like you guys were. When I opened it, there was nothing in it... ...but old papers. Where's that suitcase? I...V. Arumugamsamy of Nochukuppam, the shop of my ancestors in Thambu Chetty street... ...I leave them behind for my only son Mani a.k.a Manikandan. Hey! What are you guys up to at this hour? Even the owner of that shop wouldn't guard it like you guys do. Are you guys planning to buy that shop? Huh!? Look at his suitcase, face and his trousers... Huh! I will be the first to be the happiest, if these three start going to work. Ok continue. The first and foremost good thing which happened in our lives... ...was this! Aha! Going for a walk is like... One... Two... Three... -Four... -Hey...! Hey...just continue with your work. -Get lost. -Don't mess with me... My Lord! "It's said that Mother, Father and Teacher are God..." Why are they coming with a garland? "That's the reason they left the friend go" "My Lord!" "It's said that Mother, Father and Teacher are God..." "That's the reason they left the friend go" "We'll concur it's never our mistake" "We'll raise a solid argument on that" The garland is quite huge. Did someone die in our area!? It isn't for me, 'cause I'm alive. -Hey...Hey...Hey! -Put it! The garland gained respect. Why are you guys giving me this garland? -Brother! -Huh!? We've decided to start a new business. Business uh!? Ah...that's right! -Driver come here. -I'm coming boss. It's not a dream then... -Take this and keep it inside the car. -Sure Boss. Hey, are you guys serious about it? Brother, we swear on our mothers. Did you guys inform your parents? -Not yet. -Why? Thought of telling you first before our parents. Hey...Hey...Hey, I'm not able to take this. -I'm not able to... -You should definitely come. What happened? -I'm headed to Vellore for 2 days. -Oh no! My blessings are always with you guys. -Ok, congratulations. -Thanks a lot brother. That's fine. Brother can you give me your hand... -And your legs for me... -Hey...Hey...Hey! You look damn fit, awesome. It's hard to digest this reality! Dad! Dad, we've decided to start a business. Yeah! With these faces, It doesn't seems like you guys are starting a business. But surely looks like you will destroy me. Dad, have I ever asked you for anything in last 7 years? You're right! Then what's it? You failed the 10th grade, never were able to get through it. Whenever I used to walk on the road, you guys were sitting shamelessly in front of me. Did I ever ask anything of you? Don't try to kill my peace to fulfill yours. I won't remain civil about it. Shiva's Dad! You don't have to just give it to us, loan us Fifteen Lacs. Will return it in a year. Do you even know how zeroes are there in Fifteen lacs? I do! One...Two...Four... Four! Oh! it's Three right? -Take these sweets. -Give them to these buffaloes. Hey come in. -How are you dear? -We're good Ma. -Everyone should prosper. -Ok Ma. Us, our relatives, our neighbors in fact everyone around us. What happened!? Why does Dad look pissed? We had asked for funds to start a business... ...to which he's pissed as if I asked him of his wealth. Oh no...my God, I should prosper in first place. Ma!? Are you praying for yourself? Oh no! Hey, you know I can't go against your Dad's will. I'll help as much as I could. Can you guys arrange for the rest? Take this. We're getting the funds. Give that. -Take this... -Wow! -What's it? -Not enough. Great, you're our God Mother. -Give it to us. -Take it. Are you happy now? Mother! Mother! Mother! That's enough, come here and hold this. -What happened? -Everything is fake. Your father was way better, told us off on our faces. But your mother is trying something else. No, it isn't me... This is the plan. I can't see anything but can hear a sound. Remove those glasses. Oh! you're here. Hmmm...tell me. He's the guy. He looks like a pulpy NERD. Let that moron be. Make sure he's gone from this city tonight. Don't worry about the money. You look very capable of it, why don't you do it yourself? Not possible, he's from our area. -That's why I'm hiring you. -Is it so? -Buddy!? -Tell me buddy. New guy, need to be taken care of... ...are you free? I'm free as a bird, tell me where it has to be done. Just hold on a moment. -Which area? -Kuilthottam! Kuilthottam! Kuilthottam! We're there right now. The weapons are ready too. Fine, I'll be there soon. Right, It'll be done. You better pay up now. There's 10 Lacs in this, it's all in the denomination of 100's. So it's a result of begging. It should be done precisely. Damn it come this side... -It's very clear now... -What's clear? -That we won't prosper. -Oh no! I'm very clear about it. How come you've lost hope buddy. The ONE up above must've a bigger plan for us. Definitely he must've a plan. -Doesn't seem like... -Get to the side... You know my Dad right! Ya, that Aravind! I expected of him to mock at me. But I never expected my mother to mock at me. But I had expected it, about what? That this dog would pounce on that coconut. Fatso! I'll break this Fatso's jaw, I'm so damn pissed. What did you say? Hey, try beating me up... Damn you... Come on if you have guts... He was right about you... You don't even know how many zeroes are there in 15 lacs. But you talk like a big shot. How would I know, he caught me off guard. I'll ask him one thing now, let's see if he can answer... Ask him. Hey...what would remain if one drinks off 90ml from a quarter? A cutting will be left. That's wrong. Then...!? ...he will remain high!!! I'll slipper you damn it! Catch hold of him Raj. Hey let me go. Hold him tight. Hey don't hit me. Hey...do you have matches? No! You're lurking around the streets without matches... ...how can you call yourselves men. Morons do you have any brains? Hello...Hello...Hello! -Who's this? -If we don't have, what else do you expect? What's it brother? Is he drunk? We're drunk too, take him away. Hey, you're not aware of who's he. Damn you guys! Who!? Your boss doesn't seem to know how I am? Buddy, tell him. Oh God! Places where Injustice holds high, there his Injustice will dance hard. -Hey! -Hey! Stop it right there. Now you dance idiot. Injustice it seems... ...will dance!? Hey come get your share of beatings. Where the hell is that pulpy NERD? Oh God! Oh God! I've got you now! It was just a match box... If we did, will definitely give it to you, we don't have it. Take it from your underwear. I don't wear underwear brother. Brother, let me go. If at all I see you again in this area... ...what the hell is he doing? Brother, it's not right to kill for a match box. Runaway from this area. Hey! First wear an underwear. Brother, was it him who sent you? That's my Dad, he's my only enemy. Your Dad!? Brother! Elango Brother! He's here, mission completed. -Yes! -Elango brother! Elango Brother! Brother come out soon, hurry up. Brother... Oh God no...! I did warn you not to be around them. I didn't even say what it is, and he's already running... ...wonder what happened to my child? Why did he come running so fast? Damn! "Do you know what friendship is?" I know! FRIEND! Welcome baldy! He's your son it seems. That's why I gave the money to him instead. The guys will prosper for sure. Look here, my father was like you, that's why I'm this now. I'm in your shoes right now. If at all you trouble these guys anymore... ...I'll bump you off, without taking a fee for it. Really you'll kill me? Really!? There's no need for heroism. Wait for five minutes. Guys have arranged for an amazing feast. We'll have it sumptuously and give our blessings. -Feast was amazing. -Thanks a lot brother. Call me if at all there's any issue. Definitely! Bye! Tata! Sir, do you need anything else? Brother, get a half boil here. I'm very sure... ...about you three succeeding in life, Raj. Thanks brother. This is just a small treat for you. Once the business picks up, I'll bathe you with alcohol at a five star hotel. It's been dream for long... It's all happening now, 'cause of Shiva. You just wait and watch, we'll be rocking. That's fine, it's your first project... ...how can you be drinking at this moment? I shouldn't... Drinking 'cause I'm sad. And Shiva knows that well. Hey! Will you be serving me the omlette!? Wait for it, will be there. But the guys have been working really hard. What's your pain? Why are you drinking? Just say, why are you drinking? Love failure! You've been drinking 'cause of love failure. I'm drinking, 'cause I'm not able to love anyone. How's that? There are many fishes in the pond. Pick one and get married. That's right. There's no scarcity for girls in our city. But the good ones are a rare to find. You're right. Hey... Hey...come, hey, let go. He will deceive you of love, and you expect me to sleep on it. What does he think of himself? Everyone is looking at us. -She's right! -Let them look. I'm not scared of them. There guys... ...will drink to failure, also when they're in love. Also will drink to deceiving someone in love. -Hey! -Drunkards! Come let's go. What have you done? Can't you be civil like a normal girl? Thought your fashion was off, but your attitude is too. This isn't an issue at all. Wonder what else you will have us to endure. This isn't a case to be worried about. I'll speak to the Sub-Inspector. -You can leave. -Ok Sir. -Please leave. -Ok Sir. Mr.Veerazhagavan, don't take this seriously. Agreed, it's my daughter's mistake. But what that guy did wasn't right either. Make a fair deal of it. Ok, I'll take care of the hospital bills. Sekar, ask them to arrange the chairs at 4 in the morning. Brother, he's sleeping during the job... ...please wake him up. Brother, are the banners ready? Everything is on track, we'll rock it. Hey buddy... ...do you really know how to cook? We were told you were a skilled cook, but you're not capable of cutting a carrot. Shiva, I can't work if he keeps mocking at me. Take him away. -Why have you been disturbing him. -Let's see now if you can... Hey, get lost idiot. Hope you guys are happy? -Is everything fine? -Thanks a lot. For getting us married without our parents support, and doing it free of cost. We will never forget this favour. Don't let us down like that. We agreed to do it free of cost just for this first wedding. You will have to help us grow bringing in business. That's right. You're friends are bound to get married in future. Definitely brother. We'll refer all our friends to you. -That's enough. -Where's Raju? -Where's he? -Hmmm! -Damn! -He's here... Hey, why won't you pick up the call? I left the phone on charge. Hey, did you switch on that charger!? Hey! How many times do I have to mention not to drink on the job. Why do you happen to give one when I'm drinking!? Not that... ...I just had little to drink. -not sure why... -Just shut it... Get lost! Bugger face! Hey! Who's that new Bee, sucking out the honey from my garden? It was a mistake canceling my order in this area. Who the hell picked up that order!? Oh...Oh! You guys were lurking around jobless, suggested you guys to go for job. But you're down to kill my business. Do you even realize how much I've gone through to get here? Do you think business is a child's play? If you have to open the shop at 8AM, you will have to be up by 4AM. I've built this business with no sleep working hard 24/7 and 365 days. Whether it's my mother, or my children, have worked hard without even looking at their faces for months together. I've worked to an extent that didn't have time to even digest the food I have. You can't run in Olympics, 'cause you can speak about RIO. Just like that you can't be Ambani, if you're aware of JIO. Hey, this business have been a hereditary... ...each day, each minute, even every second... ...I've sculpted it myself! -Hello! -Huh!? What have you been ranting all this while? Leave! We called you, 'cause you're experienced. But it's a first for us. So don't mind if something goes wrong. Buddy, everything is on track. Is everything fine in the dining area? -Brother! -Shiva!? I'm not sure what you'll do... -Hey drunken monkey leave... -Call Shiva please... Buddy! Why did you guys get down? Thanks a lot brother. Thanks a lot! It's coming from the bottom of my heart. You three will stay together for your good will nature. Our hearty wishes for your business to grow bigger. Thanks a lot! This is our first wedding. This is coming from the bottom my heart... ...you guys get home with no worries. Your parents will embrace your marriage. My parents will accept us. But it's an issue at her place. You guys don't worry about that, everything will be fine. We've a gift for you guys. Where's it? -Hey, where's the gift? -Come here... Get that here. Hey! Wow! Dad! My friends and I were the one who got your children married. We did our best to make it as grand as possible. Still there was no happiness of their faces. That's 'cause you were not part of the wedding. All the lovers have this desire of getting married with their parents blessings. But due to unforeseen circumstances, they're forced to resort to such measures. That doesn't mean they exclude you from their lives. They know it well, that parents are never selfish. It's the people around them are selfish. If we go on to add, just 'cause their children were in love, fearing their relatives reaction to it... ...have gone to an extent even kill them. This is still happening. Just think about it. When they're so determined to kill their children, imagine how determined the children will be, who wish to live. Why don't you ask anyone who got married without their parents blessings. That moment of their life... ...will be an unforgettable sad memory. There's no bigger punishment than not having their parents blessings. Pardon me, if I had something wrong. Thanks! -Mom! -What's it? -Our first project... -Ah!? ...we rocked it! -Really!? -Yupp. If you'd come would've known. If you just sit idle eating... Sorry, I meant cooking. How would you know? -What I'm saying is... -Hmmm. Doesn't matter what job we do, but it's important that we do that right. Sir! Who's that? Is Shiva Sir here? Shiva... ...Sir uh!? Shiva Sir!? He's inside. Thanks a lot son. You pulled off a great wedding without us. Thanks a lot. I swear... ...you must be really lucky to have a son like him. Ma'am those are really wise words. -Hey, Bride. -Hmmm. If you want them to stay this happy, then live a life fulfilling it. -Understood!? -Hmmm. -We're leaving... -Ok Ma'am. You guys should definitely come over one day. Definitely! Ok Ma'am. -We're leaving. -Sure. We're leaving. -Brother! -Thanks brother. -You must be happy. -I'm very happy. One thing, I saw a couple of your friends in love... check with them if they need our support or they have their parents support. -I will... -Thanks brother. You've been working for all these years... ...look at my Son. An entire family came to give their blessings to him. There was something special about him. We should've given him money to start the business. But it's you who always peck him for a fool. Hey, he has hired them to talk good about him. Dad...Dad...Dad...Dad! What did I ever do to you? Why do you think so low of me? Mom!? Is he really my father? -Damn you! -Ah...! Mom is getting worked up... ...so I trust her on this. Huh! It's 8:30AM and they aren't open yet. Look at their way of business. -They can't match up to you boss. -Open the shop... Right! Good Morning Brother! Hey, where's Raj? He doesn't report to me... ...he's been missing a lot these days. And you don't seem to bother. Brother, two Teas. Where's he grazing these days... Shut up! -You're useless. -I'm pitch broke. -Oh no... -Brother... Oh God no...! Did you get hurt? Check if you did... Does you head hurt? -Sorry...sorry brother. -Check if you're bleeding. I rammed in by mistake, sorry. -It has started to... -What has started...? Hey...what the hell is this? Must be a small wound. So you won't get off the bike... Give me an answer to this... Answer right!? I'll give one now... ...make sure it's not a tough one. What the hell! Give me a solution to this accident. What should I do? You'll knock down a family guy and just leave!? I'll beat you to pulp, take him to the hospital. The auto is here, move aside. Move, come here. -Why are you leaning on me? -You come here. You get inside first. I don't even have cash to pay the auto fare. -Brother... -If not then use that chain. That was a gift from my father's wife. Brother, at least let me take the bike... If at all something goes wrong with him... ...not sure even if he'll live. Just shut up, it's a small wound on the head and you're ranting losing life. A small wound!? It's on the nerves. Come on dear Robert, come here. How are you? Are you dizzy? -He looks fine... -You just shut up. -What happened nurse? -He's drunk... Get him when he's in senses, we'll treat him. You're useless, just shut up. Hello brother, it seems he's drunk. -How did he know? -So what if he's drunk? He had a small drink in the morning, and you're making a big deal out of it. Hey, weren't we minding our business? You were the one who rammed into him. Now how will he do his job? I don't care, compensate with Ten Thousand rupees. If not, I'll rip you apart. Ten Thousand! I don't have such an amount with me. If you don't have, then ask someone to get it. What's it Robert, is he trying to mock me? Hey, this Raju isn't doing any work here. In spite I own this place, aren't I working? He just lurking around drunk. When questioned, says he's a partner. Tell me Mr.Raju! Buddy, I met with an accident on the way. Accident uh! -Are you fine? -I'm fine, only the guy got a little hurt. A little hurt!? Does this look a little to you? Why don't you just shut up. You're hurt so bad, and he calls it a little. Buddy, give the phone to him. Just shut up and sit tight. Brother, my friend wants to speak to you. I can't speak to some unknown person... ...ask him to come down if he's got guts. Buddy! You stay right there. Don't show them the money until I'm there. Ok buddy. Let's leave. My friend is coming down. Huh!? Let him come down. Let me see what he's capable of. I'm all for justice... ...but for Injustice...! Damn you! Can't you get treated at a Govt. Hospital? It wasn't me, but him. Boss, why are you hitting him on the wound? I was just asking to take care of the treatment. I'm fine with any hospital. Hey...Hey! He's the one who's been torturing. I'm letting you go, just 'cause of him. If not would've been bad for you. You're all for Justice, right!? But for Injustice??? Take him away, I'll kill him. I was just kidding let it go brother. Forget about it. Look at their ways to loot. The phone's ringing. Tell me. Customers are here, how long do I have to wait? Handle them, we'll be there. How do you want to me handle them?...hello! Buddy! Do you know why I was here? I never asked for it. Where the hell are you guys!? Coming Soon Sir! They're here. -Buddy looks like a Big Fish. -Where were you guys, hurry up. -They've been waiting for long. -Just a moment Sir. Sir, Juice! -Have this juice... -Hmmm. Hey shut up. Sorry we got held up. Not an issue brother. Tell me Sir. I'm a retired High Court Judge. Ok Sir. I'm thinking of a grand wedding for my grand daughter. My grand son, referred you guys to me. Will you be able to do it? We'll have a blast! I was talking about wedding, and he's saying will have a blast. No sir, he meant to say will make it a grand fete. It's not an ordinary wedding. There will be a lot of VIP's attending it. I understand, you have faith in us. We'll do a great job. It should be a grand event. We'll do it definitely. Give me the name of the Bride and the Groom also other details. Groom's name is Sathish, and sister's name is Priyadarshini. -No.6.... -What about your 60th anniversary? First get this one done. Sir I apologize. Can you go with someone else for the job? WHAT!? Are you kidding? Just 'cause my grandson referred I came to you guys. Do you think we're jobless to come and discuss this? No Sir, we won't be able to do it. It's better you go with someone else. Are you guys playing with me? -Hey come let's go. -Can you be respectful? What kind of respect? There's a saying... "Beggar's desire to get on the palanquin." He spoke out of anger. What do you mean by anger? Even I can speak out of anger. Rascal! Hey, there are many in the market. Get up and leave. -Sir...Sir! -Brother, what have you done? Wonder why they need an office. Can you explain to him? Hey, why are you doing this? He spoke 'cause he was angry about something else... You guys might have million problems. It's me who's screaming and you're having water. Shouldn't you have some manners how to talk to big shots? You're to be blamed. Sir, please come here. Look, there's another shop here let's go there. Look at the faces come down to do business. -Come in Sir. -Greetings! -Son come in. -Greetings. What's the occasion? who's wedding is it? is it yours? No not mine. -It's my Grand Daughter's. -Is that so? If you dye your mustache, can get you married again. That was a good one. They're disrespectful, I was watching everything. He should be concerned about the details for the pertaining job. Why does he need the names of the Bride and the Groom. I'll show you the album. You check and pick the one you like. Get me the date and we'll get it done right away. Hey, take out that album. Get it soon! Here take this, look at the auditoriums in it and pick one you like. I don't have time to look through the album. I don't want to waste my time. Don't have to. Why don't we take a direct look at the venue. We can sure. Come with me in the car, I'll drop my grandson off. -He's a businessman. -Take care of the shop, I'll be back soon. I'm getting picked up in a BMW. Hey! That was a big one, why did you do this? Pull down the shutter. Huh!? Pull them down. Hey, pull them down. It's too much to shut down, 'cause you're pissed. Things I go through for a small drink. Phew! Bro! Can I sit here? Thank you...thank you! Buddy! You shouldn't reflect the anger on me over the customers. Then why do you do such things, damn it! Hey Mani, can you shut up, I'm speaking to him. Hey! He spoke my mind. If It's you I can agree, but how can this bear ask me such... Hello! I have my rights, I own that place. You!?...Owner!? You weren't aware of it, until we told you, and you're talking politics. I'll break your jaw with just this. Ok, I'm asking now. Tell me. I have to right!? Tell me, why did you go there? I was wondering, why should I discuss family issues? My father has got a mistress in that area. Hey! I don't think that's the truth... ...he's lying don't believe him. Hey bloody crook! What are you staring at? Huh! Staring!? -Hey! -You think I'm scared. Do you really think, I'll be scared? Tell me! Ok I believe you. You have faith in me right!? Then give the keys to the shop to Mani. Give the keys to the shop to Mani. Buddy! How can you ask me to give him the keys... Instead you ask me to hand it over to thief, I'll do it. But you're asking me to give it to this fool. You're right. Even if he's a fool, will lose it without his knowledge. But a thief will steal on purpose. I got it. You're indirectly accusing me as a thief. Hey let's leave, he's high. Hey Mani, what's your problem? He's saying it on your face, and you're clueless moron. Hey! You just handover the keys. Give it! This isn't fair Shiva, you're listening to this clown. Stop, stop I say. Why aren't you stopping? Stop damn it. Stop damn it! And this one... Hey do you trust me or not? I trust you. If so, then get me the keys. Let that be with him. So, you don't trust me!? What's your problem now? Oh I get it now... ...he bought you drinks ain't he? That's why this attitude. Let it be. Fatso, do you trust me or not? -No. -Huh! Can't trust a hissing snake. As if...! Hey, who's flashing those lights? Young Entrepreneurs! Liquor to subside the failure. Instead of asking about the date and the budget to the customer. You were inquiring like a survey officer about the bride and groom names. He gave a single cheque of Twenty Lacs. And my ride will be BMW. Auditorium is fixed. Decorations are going on. That's why business is limited to hereditary. This is the result, when you don't even know the spelling of business. Differentiation is required between a pin and a crowbar. Huh!? Holy Brothers it seems! Bloody immature lot. Look, assistant is calling me. What's it? I just got here, will load them up and send it. Judge's grand daughter ran away boss. Hey, what are you saying? Didn't you hear? Oh Dearie! "The bride to be eloped it seems" Brother... Agreed that roaming around with Ambani, doesn't make you Ambani. But you can be one, if you put in hard work like him. There's no said rule that business is limited to hereditary. Anyone who's skilled can do business. You're panicking as if we went in to your cash register. There's no need to know spelling to start a business. It's more than enough, if you know how to run it. Do you have any idea how girls are in our locality? Just say it. You don't know right!? Raju! There are a total of 11,544 girls in our area. From which 4,857 are married. From that 1,490 have got divorced. So including you, 3,361 are happily married and living a good life. And this is the count of the married ones. The next are the lovers... ...In which 2,550 are truly in love without their parents knowledge. From which 1,518... ...are in love with a third person without their parents and boyfriends knowledge. Then Imagine! Only 1,032 are sincerely in love with each other. Mani! Does our brother's daughter comes under this list. She's under the list Raju mentioned. We shouldn't rat out the daughters in front of their parents. That's our company's policy. Sorry buddy...sorry. So the remaining balance is 4,137. In that lot, 400 have turned many guys in to friend zone. And it has 2,200 infants who haven't developed teeth yet. And 937 are toothless old hags. 620 are above the age group of 60, and 317 above 70's. You're speechless now. With such research, won't we know that Judge's grand daughter will elope. There's a difference between crowbar and pin. Even a prick from a pin will inflict pain. Here on, you'll be amazed with the sound of our shop's shutter. Oh Damn! What's this Councilor? You've never made such banners even for our party meetings. Who's work is all this? They're from our area. -Really, then call them. -Shiva, come here. I'm really happy. Look here, my daughter is getting married next month. You'll have to take up the wedding planning. Sure, we'll rock it! Long live, Our Leader! Long live, Our Leader! Long live, Our Leader! Long live, Our Leader! Long live, Our Leader! Welcome Sir. Oh my, now this! Is everything good? Shiva!? -You've done an amazing job. -Thanks! Ok... ...do you have plans to get in to politics? No intentions of that sort, why do you ask? Then why are your pictures on that poster? Oh that... ...'cause we handled your daughter's wedding. We'll be famous in our area as well. -That's it right!? -That's it! -Nothing else right!? -Nothing at all. Come take this. Oh no! Thanks a lot. Come in sir, let's go. The baldy got worried... ...obviously! Wonder how we will succeed with such workers... Hey, is this a place to drink? You keep at it... ...one day Shiva will beat you to death. Hi Sir, wait for five minutes. Just five minutes we can have the food. Hey that's him. Why the hell are you carrying me.... Hey! What's it? Hey! Where's my daughter? Why are you asking us that? Paneer Girls? Show me how you'll sprinkle it? Is this how it's done? ...give it to me... One... ...two...three... Hey...Hey! If you don't tell me where my daughter is... ...you guys won't leave this auditorium. Tell me! Where's my daughter, tell me!? Take your hands off. Where the hell is my daughter? Didn't we say that we don't know... So you guys don't know... Look...Look there! Come on, come on. -I'm scared. -Don't be scared. It's just your father's poster. Hey! who are you? Where are you headed with our leader's cut out this late? It's the last cut out... ...thought of putting at the corner of the street for publicity. Hey, I'm getting goosebumps. Even we haven't thought as much as you have. Hi...get inside the car. Thanks Raju. Bye dear! "Philanthropist of the Poor" Get lost, baldy! Now what you have to say? Tell me, where's my daughter? If you don't tell me now, I'll make you a lost soul. Tell me! Sir, honestly I don't know. Your daughter in fact was pleading to me. That's why I did this as a favour. Who's that? Who's that girl with her? That girl... ...is your daughter's friend. -Boss! -Yes... They've taken your daughter to a temple and got her married. Married!? Hey! These three shouldn't leave this auditorium. Beat them up. How can you think of betraying us? How much did Ramanan pay you? Do you really think I did this for money? Hey, don't act shamelessly. Then why did you do it? I swear didn't do this for money. I did this for a girl. Hi..get inside the car. -Thanks Raju. -I've taken a grave risk for you. Until they find out themselves, you shouldn't utter it even to your close friends. -Promise!? -One minute. Where is she looking? Is the baldy here? Oh that one, it's me. I was really handsome younger. Bye dear! Hey Shiva! What's with him... Hey Raju! didn't we decide that girls won't come in to our lives... ...hey Mani, Mani, Mani! Just shut up Mani, I'm talking to him. Get lost! I hid it, 'cause you'll get pissed on hearing it. Are you nuts? We were young stupid and made that decision. If at all you had mentioned, we wouldn't have taken this project. Bloody fool! Hey...Shiva! In our area... ..there was a girl named Kala. She was pretty and was our neighbor. She was torturing me to love her for 3 1/2 years... ...just 'cause you guys said so, listen to what I'm saying... ...just 'cause of that, I didn't give room for that to happen. Mani, she's differently abled. Don't confuse it with love. Hey, you're laughing!? Keep laughing. Let's see which category does your girlfriend come under. Hey...Hey...Hey! Don't talk ill about her. Buddy, I ran a background check the first day I saw her. She was never in love. She's pure, just like Kannagi. You! You guys have to come and see her just for my sake. You guys will definitely like her. Just listen to me. Just have a look once. If you don't like her then, let me know... ...I'll let her go. Bye! Hey Shiva...that's Raju's girl. That's right. Raju's girl. Good looking right!? Buddy, how's she? How's she? I've managed to prepare a hook, I think might workout. She has asked to meet alone. I think she's going to propose. Mani. Mani! Mani! What's it? I have to tell you something important. It's fine... ...you might not believe it. Hey! What's it? Don't be kidding, tell me what is it? Nothing much... ...that girl. -Which one? -That one... ...who we saw in the morning. -Shruthi. -Ya... When she crossed us in the morning... ...seemed like she was looking at you. Damn! Have you gone mad? She's Raju's girl. How can you think of such things? Shut up and sleep. She's so pretty... ...but me!? Shut up and sleep! Checking me out it seems. Fool! That's what I felt, so was just letting you know. Don't mix beer and dessert. Moron! Hey Shiva! She was indeed checking me out. Poor thing Raju! Why does he have to be worried. Only if both agree to it, it's a relationship. Raju's love is unrequited. Now that girl has to decide. That's right. Hey Raju, where are you? Don't know punctuality is important in love? Shouldn't you be meeting Shruthi? Hey, I'm aware of it, you just come to the tea shop. What does he know? She's been checking me out. Do you know that!? Pineapple! Take this. -Raju what's your sun sign? -Aquarius. It's a good day for Aquarius. What's up buddies!? What!? Why do you look sad? Are you not well? What? What's it? Nothing much...I was just following her all these days. Shiva is asking me to propose to her. It's not that... He's been longing for it... ...only if he proposes he'll know. Who she's really in love with. Oh! If so then Raju do it. Only then we'll come to know who she really likes. I don't mind telling her... ...but she was booked under a petty case. That's the reason I'm having second thoughts. Poor thing! How will I even face him? That's why I was wearing these shades. Buddy! Sun Sign - Aquarius. Shiva said it's a good day. I've decided now. I'm going to propose her today. Hey, she's mine. I Love You! I Love You too! That girl never checked me out... It's you who manipulated me in to this. It's not a right thing. It's fine if you're in love but not me? Hey! It's you who instigated me. And you committed the mistake. I will definitely let Raju know about this. Look here Mani. She has already accepted me. I know, when and how to convey this to Raju. But I need some time for that. I can't agree to that. I'm going to tell Raju everything. Go on tell him... ...I have no issues. That property of yours... ...the Shop! I've transferred it to my name. I won't return it. Hey, bumble-duck! That's my father's love to me. Only that is left as a memory of him. If at all, you mess around with it... I'll kill you! Then shut up. When the time is right, I'll speak to Raju. Hey thieving bugger! Here on you're not my friend but a foe. Hold this! Buddy! Hey! Why do you look worked up? What's happ...? Why are you crying? So what if My love had it's last rites at someone else's funeral. That's doesn't mean my love is not strong. Is it fine? If I go and propose to her right away? Wipe your tears. Be strong. "The lion has left his den..." Damn you puddle-pie! He's a poor thing. Are you nuts? This was the first time you've seen him. And you're in love with him already!? Who said it was the first time? The guy who I cheated during my 10th grade exams... ...do you remember that? Do you know who is that guy? That's Shiva! You're hopeless. He's a poor thing. I swear... I've never committed anything wrong, since the day I cheated him. I got an opportunity to make everything right. Seriously! I'm the happiest women in the world now. -Hey... -Hello, can you get down please...? Why is Raju here? -Is there a dog? -No. What's it Raju? Is there an issue with her Dad? Nah...nothing of that sort. I've to speak to you in private. -To me? -Yes. Ok! I want to talk to her in private. Oh yeah! I... wanted to... ...speak to you about this for long. I Love You! Have you gone mad? -Mad!? -I'm in love with Shiva. Pick that call! Pick you damn it! Pick up and speak. You're done now! Pick that! -Hello! -Tell me... All this while I had a friend named Shiva, but now I have enemy with the same name. That girl... ...seemed to be in love with a guy named Shiva. I had poison, buddy. Hey! -What's wrong with you? -That's right... Where are you at Raju? At the beach... Where!? -That beach... -Which one!? -Hello! -What happened? Hello...Raju! RAJU! Hey, he had poison it seems. What did you say? You've killed my best friend. Fool, take your hands off me. -Come let's leave. -Raju...! The head is hanging loose... ...just shut up you fool! Stop here. Hey...Hey...Raju. Be careful. Doctor! -No one's here... -Push him to this side. Raju...Raju! -Raju...Raju, look at me. -Raju! Hey Raju! Granny! Granny, my friend has consumed poison. Have to save him. Why did you bring him here? The Doctor won't be here during the night. It's been a while since he had the poison. Please ask the Doctor to come down, please... I'm aware of what the Doctor does... ...shall I help you with it? It should've been you taking that poison. But he did, in spite of knowing what you did to him. He's still not aware, I'm that Shiva. Oh no! He's a poor thing. What happened? He'll be up by 4AM, don't worry everything is fine. Granny...It's 4AM now... Oh God no... I'm not sure what went wrong. He should've been up by now. Oh it's 4:15AM, I was wrong about the timing. -Son... -Huh!? I've flushed everything out of him, He shouldn't have anything except curd rice. Ok! Take good care of him. -Ok Granny... -Thanks Granny... Bloody Sinners! Have been charging a bomb for such a small issue. Why are you sleeping? What else to do? You wanted to talk... It's been half an hour since we got here. Raju shouldn't know about us, for sometime. But I've already told Raju... Nah...he just knows that it's Shiva. But he doesn't know that it's me. In fact, what I actually did while proposing was... When that girl went past us in the morning... It seemed like she was checking you out. Raju is a poor thing. Damn you! You're a smooth player. I was cheated by a girl during my 10th grade. Since then, until I saw you... ...never really liked anyone. So you can Imagine how it is... -Shiva! -Hmmm. If someone else had proposed other than you, accepting that would've been doubtful. Hey! Tell Raju about us as soon as possible. If not he'll be behind me for no reason. Guys have a character... ...they don't disturb the committed ones. Hey, it's getting late. Shall we leave? Oh! Why did you press that? This is sign of happiness. If the food is good or we're happy we can press that. Is that so? Thank you Sir! -Hey! -Thank you Sir! Sir, don't be playing with it. After all, with the help of a granny... Do you think it's possible to save a life with the help of a granny? Friendship is great! Wonder how it's going to end. If it's not for him, I wouldn't have been alive. To speak about his friendship, I have no.... Hey, he's here. He'll live for 100 years. Mark my words. Buddy. -Come here... -A tea please... Thanks Buddy! What's wrong with you? I'm must be really lucky to you have you as my friend. If it's not for you, I would've been dead. He's the reason you even had that poison. What's it? Mosquitoes! Sorry buddy, I didn't listen to you. Our friendship is more than enough. Let's not worry about the girls. Let's get back to our old self and continue with it. Dad, let's not. Dad... Dad please... Shut up and come. Dad listen to what I have to say. Come! Dad let's leave...please. You're a dead meat now. He's going to slit you. Not to worry, I'll handle it. I'll finish up, only when we're over it, they'll start over. Was about get this sorted with you myself. But look at the fate, here we are... Hey move away... Hey...Hey! Sorry Uncle...Uncle! That's me...where are you going? -Hey! -Don't push me uncle. Shruthi, didn't you tell who it is? Look he's going elsewhere. Oh no, it's not him. It's me not him. This is my friend. I swear that it's me. Hey...take you hands off me. Dad! I kill you, if I see you hanging out with my daughter again. I won't be just talking the next time. Come! Sorry Shiva! Why did he slap you? Why did slap you instead? Has he gone crazy? Hey, who do you think is crazy? It's you, who is a complete mental. They've been in love for three months. Her father himself has ratted them out. Can't you still get it moron? Is he telling the truth? Hey, answer him. He is buddy! And now you're saying this... Why didn't you mention this earlier? You both royally.... -Buddy, I was going to... -Hey! That's it! I apologized thinking, I did something wrong. You guys screwed my royally. Buddy! -Listen to what I have to say... -Hey! Here on, I'm not going to listen to you... ...neither do my friendship. I'm always inclined to the justice. Hey Raju, stop! What's it Raju? What's with the new habit? You're drinking alone without me. Brother, I'm in trouble. Don't irritate me. Something wrong between you guys? It isn't as simple as you think. It's a very serious one. Fine, let that go. Will you listen to me? Brother! Will you or not listen to me? Brother, they... Will you or not listen to me!? I will listen to you. Mani didn't I say that Raju will listen to me. Hey! Hey! I care a damn, if you guys are in talking terms or not. -Raju... -Hey Mani. I'm extremely angry, might hurt you with this bottle. Break it, come on do it. But listen to me first, then you can hurt me. I'm not at all happy with him. I was in hell for 3 months. He trapped me in to it. He blackmailed me. With what? You know well... ...about the properties, my house and that shop. He transferred that shop in to his name. What!? Did you happen to sign anywhere? No! I didn't sign anywhere. Bloody mental, how can he then transfer without your signature. Look at him... He has cheated both of us. We shouldn't let him go. We'll have to do something about it. We've to finish him. We should just let him go. That's better for us. Shop is yours and funds are mine. We'll take care of it. Hey...! I'm going to rock...Hey! Hey...get lost you bloody bugger. Look there... What's it? Sir!!! Just ignore him. Where were you guys? Why aren't you guys answering your phones? I'm talking to you guys. Why are you turning around? Oh, so you can talk to us unnecessarily. But we shouldn't turn around...? Brother... ...you can't transfer someone's property without their signature. You made a fool out of me. Shop is mine, and funds are his... ...you can better leave. Oh! As if you're a superstar. Walking with an attitude tall as a mountain. Damn! Raju don't listen to this fool and make hasty decisions. Fine, if he's a fool. Let him be a fool. I'm not any good listening to a genius too. Got screwed! He's a good person, in spite of being a fool. But you... I'm fine being with a fool. He just mentioned it once... ...buddy change the locks. Oh...hey! Don't stalk us to the places we hang around, making a puppy face, making your mother call us. Don't do such cheap things. 'Cause it'll go in vain. -Hey! -Huh!? You're high and speaking nonsense. You guys will suffer without me. Who!?...Us!? Get lost you damn it. Look here, even we're suffering... ...we won't call you. 'Cause you're our suffering. -Is that so? -Yeah! -We'll see... -What? What do you mean by that? I'm asking you not to come and see us. I would've thrashed you, if we weren't friends before. Don't you ever step inside the shop. -Open it. -Hey! You guys spoke your mind... ...now hear me out. Be quick, we've shut down. Bloody mocking me... -You'll be crying without me... -We'll see about that. Oh no, look at what's happening here? Mani! It wasn't the booze which was talking last night. I was very sober about it. Here on, we have no business with him. Huh!? Just see, he'll come pleading for help. I just saw the consequences on helping the lovers. They've blinded Sasikumar in the process. Let's not Mani. It's him who needs us. We don't need him anymore. -What do you say? -I've already forgotten. -It's just us for each other. -Huh! What did he say? That we'll cry if he isn't with us. It's him who should be crying. He'll definitely cry, I'm sure he must be crying right now. Very Good! Greetings Sir! Is Shiva your friend? He was until yesterday. But not now. He said the same thing... -Who? -Come on... -Who are you talking about? -Come on, Come on. Sir, the shop is open. Let me at least close it down. It's not me, you must've mistaken. -Get inside the car, get in. -Just listen to me Sir... Just get in, don't talk back. -Get in... -Sir!? -Get in. -I'm getting in. He eloped with the girl it seems. What are you saying? Sir! He's even got a caller tune matching to situation. He won't pick up the call, please understand. In fact I was the first one to fall in love with your daughter. -Hey. -I was the second one... Is my daughter's life a joke to you guys? Sir, don't get angry. Hey call him. He isn't picking up the call, what's the point. Awesome. Just wait for couple of minutes, I'll take this call. OK! Buddy, didn't I warn that you'll cry if I'm not there. Hello...! Where are you? Let that be, tell me where are you guys? Sir, can we tell him? At Police Station. Is he there? The Shop Owner? Hey! Hey! Where did you elope with that girl? Oh that thing... Oh so you're not aware of what's happening? My father in law started looking for a new match for Shruthi. It's not right to let go of the girl who we love for another guy. -Tell me, is it right or wrong? -Ah!...it's wrong. It's wrong, so what now? That's why... ...we're getting married today. Once it's done, I'll come to the police station. Sir!? Until then you guys be there as my pawns. Okay! -Bye buddy. -Hey! I have nothing to do with this Sir. Just 'cause he asked, how can your daughter be such a fool to leave. I feel it must be your daughter's plan. Tell them Mani. Mani...Mani!? He fainted Sir. Let us go Sir, don't kill us in encounter. Hold on a moment, we'll talk. Tell me. Sir... It was our mutual decision to get married. That doesn't mean you can get married. -Sir...Sir! -How can you do it? Sir...hello Sir stop it. If you want to handle yourself, then why did you complaint to us? Sir, my daughter is very innocent. She's unaware of such things. It was him, who polluted her mind. Sir, she's a major now. So what if she's a Major? Sir you don't have the right to hit him. Take hands off him. I can't sit idle looking at this nonsense. Do you expect me to sit idle? Sir, you stop hitting him. Ask your daughter. If she agrees, you can take her no one will stop you. Come! Shruthi...come. Come dear. Why are you standstill? Come! How dare...!? I'll just... Have I ever... ...laid hands on you. Shruthi!? Look what it has come to now... Shruthi... I beg of you, please come home. Dad...Dad I'll come. I'll come Dad. Dad...please... Please listen to Dad and come... -I'll come Dad. -Shruthi... I'll come! I'll come...I'll come Dad. Son, in my experience. The difference is really small when it comes to men and women. If there's an issue. Men will hold on to it and face it headstrong. But women lack that capacity a bit. Even if she had loved you sincerely, When her dad pleaded she went with him. But you got to think from her point of view. Doesn't matter what it is, but you shouldn't trouble her anymore. Understood!? Madani what happened? How would I know? Her Dad brought her up like a boy. Moreover, he let her pursue Fashion Technology. She's never worn a Saree for any occasion. But today... ...she took her mother's saree from the cupboard and eloped. Dad! I feel really embarrassed. Shall I go to my friend's place for a while? Why do you need my permission? You be as you were earlier. You can do as you wish. I've forgotten what happened at the Police station. I'm Sorry! Do you think I'm as selfish as other fathers? I brought you up. I know you well. You wouldn't do anything wrong. You will never go wrong. I love you Dad. I love you dear. Go ahead. -Ok dad. -Ok, take care. Seems like the computer brain crashed. They look worried. Huh! Young entrepreneurs, were jacked by Police Department. "Sky peeked in to starry window" "Home Bred Weddings with Holy Brothers 2" Hey Raju!? It's an easy job being a boss. Is this what you guys were doing all these days? It's not important if it's an easy job, after this... ...we shouldn't work with anyone associated with him. Not only the associated ones, even who comes asking for him, I will beat them up, strangle them and will hurt them... Come in, please come inside. Would you like to sit? Raju. She's here. Forgot what you said. Please leave, get out from here. I know... ...that you guys are very pissed with me and Shiva. You don't have to talk to me, just listen to what I have to say. Shiva is not a bad person, as you think. He's a very good person. Do you know who's a good person? Only I would know about that. It's not that Raju. I know everything. It's when you introduced to him, he started liking me. And confusing Mani about it. I knew everything. So you never checked me out. I want you three to get back together. Oh no, for god sake... ...for god sake. We can't be like that Shruthi. Broken mirror can never be mended. You won't get it, just hold on a moment. Look here, this picture. His friendship is lost even from this picture. Everything is over. Please believe me Raju. It's 'cause of me, these issues have rose. It won't happen anymore. The dialogue seems to be a long one. How can you be so confident? Are you going out of station? No... I'm going to die. -Huh!? -Huh! I... ...had poison. You had poison!? You're so cool about it as if you're reading the news. What did you have? she's coughing check what's wrong with her? Check on her. Oh God no, she fell down. You killed her. It's you, It's you, It' you who killer her. I didn't do anything, shut up. Hey! What did you guys do to this girl? We didn't do anything. She had poison before getting here. Listen come here, and lift this girl up. Please lift her up. Lift her up. I'm really scared. Keep coming! Hello...Hello! You shouldn't sleep after having poison. Nothing will happen to her right? What's this? It wouldn't have mattered if she had fallen elsewhere, but she fell in front of our shop. -Hey! -Huh! Do we have to call him now? Yes we have to, what if we get caught? -Hello! -Tell me... Your... ...your girlfriend took poison. What are you saying? What's it buddy? Looks like you let it go? Here, take her down, take her down. Be careful. Is this a good hospital? I can understand if it's your girlfriend. It all begun with you. What's with having poison? Hey! How is it the same? That doesn't mean you can have it like tea. Uncle don't beat us up at the hospital. She came to the shop and discussed about Shiva and your problems... ...but she said had poison in the last. So we brought her to the hospital. I swear this is the truth. Hey! He came for him. For the trust he has on you, you shouldn't die but he should've. You were 3 years old, when your mother passed away. Since then you were his life. I have seen it myself... Getting married to him, I don't want to betray you. At the same time marrying the guy you chose, I can't betray him. From this even one happens, I can't have a good life. That's why... ...I decided to end my life. Hey! Shruthi. You get married to him. It was a gore mistake seeing her at the bar. Damn! Please pay this bill. Hey Raju. Hey, give it to him. Huh!? Hey, give it to him. -Oh! -Go. Hey, take this, pay it. I don't have money. What!? -I don't have cash in hand. -Is it there in your account? Is it there in your account? Hey come here. Why is he in love, when he's broke. Troubling me, instead. Take this, pay it. Don't mess with me. He's really lucky. Have you gone crazy? How dare you had poison? It wasn't a daring act. I had it fearing losing you. My parents have accepted? Will it be the same with yours too? Why don't we discuss that later. Huh! Auspicious time is here. Iyer you can start. So you've bunked school today. Ask your daughter to come. Dia, ask Shruthi to come.

I never imagined getting engaged without their presence. So that's your problem. Don't worry, your friends will be there for our wedding. How's that possible? I did say right!? Trust me. If this is how you'll console me, I don't mind being sad all my life. -Brother! -Huh!? -How much is a cigarette? -It's fifteen rupees. What!? you can have it yourself. -It's fifteen! -Is GST added for cigarettes too? GST is added on water too. Oh God! Expenses have gone really high. Have to earn to take care of the expenses. For that we need a project right now. Look... -Here they are... -...It's here buddy. They'll fall in love with our daughter... ...will take her on the bike. Also will get engaged to her. But when it comes to marriage, they'll disappear in to thin air. Where's he? Look here... We have nothing to do with him. Don't come to me asking for him. If that's the case, why were you defending him back then? Now you seemed to be unaware of it. I'm keeping my cool 'cause you all are women. -If not, would've thrashed everyone... -What would you do? Hey! What's wrong with him, why is he crying like this? You all don't seem like women to me.... As if... You don't seem to show any mercy on me. Hey...! You have nothing to do with him right!? Then get him to us, we'll let you go. That's about it. Damn you! If I'd knew won't I tell you guys. I've no idea, Mani explain to them. We've been ranting all this while, why don't you trust us? Look here... We've have no relationship with him... ...also he has nothing to do with our business. It's my business and his investment. I swear on my business. Get him to us, and then you can take your keys back. Hey, come let's leave. -Now they'll come to us. -Aunty, everything is stacked inside... They took our keys to the shop.... That's the last memory of my father gifted to me. Get it back for me... That was the only key to the shop. What will we do now? He won't even talk to us. If so, do you think he'll come if we call him? It all depends on your performance now. I'll talk to him myself, OK!? -Someone's here... -They're Shiva's friends. You can leave. Come in guys. Hey! Why the hell are you guys here? Whenever you guys are here, it becomes a mess. Trust me there will no trouble caused by us. Just give us five minutes with him, we'll be quick. Only now he's in his senses. If he see's you guys again, something will crawl up. Nothing of that sort will happen, just couple of minutes. Why don't you understand? You guys very well know how uncle is? We do know him, isn't he bald? You guys are hopeless! Come in. Your notion is to get the shop keys back. Look at him... Hey! What are you guys doing here? We should be asking that question. Why did you reject the girl you got engaged to? If that was your notion, at least we would have pursued. -Mani!? -I meant one of us. Mani, I've moved on, and you too move on. Now you tell me!? I committed a mistake. I committed a huge mistake. Wondering how I got to cheating you guys for her. Even if you guys move on, I won't be able to. Have decided to annoy us today? First let us know, why you said no to that girl? You wouldn't be talking the same, if you knew who she is? Hey! Is she the same girl, who cheated you in 10th grade exam? Yes she's the one! She once again made a fool out of me. Hey, what makes you say that? Don't speak like a fool. Wonder how I'll explain this... It was wrong of us to fall in love with her. You falling for her was the right thing. This was decided by the God himself. God! You're the mighty one! -You did the right thing. -Don't be a fool. It was her, 'cause of which our lives took a different turn. Who do you think ruined our business? Moreover it was her due to which we're not friends anymore. After all this, how do you expect me to be with her? I won't be able to trust her anymore. I swear I won't. Don't trust her...don't. You will never... ...it isn't just you, everyone in the world is just like you. You guys never the trust the girl who loves your sincerely. Aren't you ashamed, speaking like this. Huh!? You've been ranting that she deceived you, she took your paper and submitted as hers. If you had submitted, do you think you would've topped? She topped, we should be proud of it. Should be proud of it. As if she deceived you... Didn't you do the same? didn't you cheat on his friendship? She didn't even check me out... ...didn't you make a fool out of me stating she did. Stop ranting the same. How can you accuse her of that? Didn't she consume poison and came looking for you to the shop? We did say... ...that she's shrewd and selfish. Also that she's not the right one. Even when she was about to die... ...she was just on stating that "Shiva is a good person". Who would do such a thing for you? Will your Dad? or will your Mom would? Or would you yourself? Now even if you wish to, she won't be yours. Doesn't realize. You were too good Mani. Now you can call him, he'll come. Oh God! Shiva! Didn't I tell you guys... You said will talk and get him to agree. Why do you have to bring up the Poison? I knew something will go wrong. I curse you guys for this. Shiva! Go and check for the doctor hurry up. Hey, Shiva look mom is right here for you. -Mom is here for you dear. -Shiva...Shiva. Bloody buffalo, don't pretend to be innocent. -It's all 'cause of you... -That side. Sister! Go faster! It's just us in such a big hospital. Just hold on for a moment. -There must be someone... -Doctor!? -Buddy no one's here. -Wonder what we would do? Did you really have the poison!? Hey...Shiva! Don't worry about it aunty... ...don't cry, I've done this before. I've experience in this. If he's just taken Phenol, then we can save him. What's wrong with you damn it? Oh God! Explain to her, why have you been smiling like a lunatic? Damn you! He's in such a serious condition and you guys seemed to smiling about it. Hey Mani, let's leave. The Shiva you're looking for, is inside. There are his parents, relatives and his sisters. Moreover, this paper has all the details on his relatives and their identities. Don't come back to us looking for Shiva once again. Crazy Family! Keys! Get lost! Isn't it good we're free with no worries now? Hmmm! Indeed we're... But shouldn't be so idle without a job. All we need is just one customer. We need at least two even for a wedding. -Ain't? -Ain't indeed... What's up with the young entrepreneurs? How come you're all lazy right in the morning? Not good for the business. Nope! We were busy all night with work, so stressed out. It's quite too much for us two to handle. It was a mass wedding of 140 couples. Oh! Moreover, since we conducted Virat Kohli... It's been quite a tight schedule. We're very busy. I don't think you never got be so busy? Never happened. Not a chance. -Ah...! -How did you manage all these years? -Phew! -It's a headache. I had too much on my hands, thought of giving you guys some business. -Seems like you guys are busy enough. -Brother! Brother! Brother we've been idle for long, look at this notebook. We just have this as a prop in the shop. You guys must be busy all night, let me not... Nothing of that sort, we were just up for nothing. You guys won't be able to do it. No issues, you guys will wear yourself out. We don't even have funds to pay for electricity, look we're sweating. Just give us one project. -Just one... -Come inside brother... We've better plans than yours. Oh, you want to discuss outside the shop. Or you prefer going inside? Let's stand right here. Brother would you like to have tea? -Just give us a project. -Three Teas please. It's been ages since we got to see a wedding. He's right. -Just give us one project... -SShhhh! I'll get you this project, but I have one condition. -Tell me brother. -Tell me! Shiva shouldn't be part of this. Brother! We've thrown him out of our lives, he wouldn't dare to come. I swear he won't be seen. You just draw the line, we'll not cross that. You just get us a room. I'm not giving this to you guys... -Why is that? -Your intentions aren't right. We meant to say, we'll plan well. Nothing like you might think otherwise. Oh God! Come over in half an hour, will pay you guys the advance. Why should we wait that long, let's go now. Why don't you place this on my face? What kind of music are they playing? ask them to play something good. Take it slow, 'cause you're changing it. Reception is about to start, come on hurry. Hey fool, come here. What's it? It just says "WEDS"...who's getting married? Is it you and me? Oh no! Forgot to take Bride and Groom's names. In sometime, the Bride and the Groom will be here. And you here are giving excuses. Hey, they're here. Damn! Damn it! So it was his wedding we were working for? Where's that Ramanan? I'm that Ramanan! What do you have for me? We didn't even want to face him and you made us plan his wedding. Hey! It wouldn't look nice, if you face something else. -He's our enemy. -Then kill him... -Huh!? -Huh! You shouldn't make enemies... ...and when we do, then have to kill them. Do you even realize how much he has tortured us. Hey, do you even realize how much you three had tortured me? I incurred a loss of fifty lacs in this last year. I'm struggling here for your goodness sake. But you guys seem to have a riff with each other. Just get over with it. What's your problem with him? Is it that girl? Huh! "Generation changes, but the attitude never changes". Why is it always two guys falling for the same girl? -It's Three... -Ah...! Keep counting. Shut up! Hey, is she the last girl on the earth? It's not that you won't find another one. It's not that, love doesn't work for me. With such intoxicating eyes, you're bound to be lucky with women. Why are you giving me dirty looks? -Huh!? -Do you feel so? Would you agree, if I rape you? -Don't be kidding brother... -Raju...! -Raju! -What's it Karuppusamy? Why are your restless like an elephant? Beyond one time, you won't find friends. Please understand. -What's it brother? -Come son. -Did they forgive? -Ya! They did forgive and has buried the anger. Shall I fall on your feet? Mani shall I fall on your feet? Ask him to... He won't, look at him laugh... He will definitely fall on your feet once the wedding is over... Don't be fooling around. Convince and take them in. Raju! The day I saw Shiva in the exam hall... ...since then I developed a liking for him. I didn't fall for him for that answer paper incident... ...but for... ...his good will nature to help too. What we have is, a sincere love. Please understand. Raju... With no harm intended... ...I became the reason for you to commit suicide. Please forgive me Raju. Hey! Are you still stuck up on that? Ok I'll tell you one thing... ...if you guys don't approve of it, I won't get married to her. Hey, you can leave... Hey...! I want this wedding to happen. -What do you say? -@#$%&* Snubbed! Get their names on the board. Fine, Mr.Peanut! Also start the music. Hey Shiva! What's does your horoscope say? -Why do you ask? -Shiva... Just asking... -Smile... -Smile! I didn't want to help you in love, but you managed in getting me help with your marriage. Don't give me that look, will punch you in the face. The answer paper you passed on to your girlfriend then, did you mention, that it was me who gave it to you? Don't bother! Have a good life! Hey, do you know "What Friendship is?" I do very well, have extensive experience of it. Shiva! Ah...! I shouldn't be asking this, but I'm now... Ok dear...Ok dear, love doesn't works out for me. My father doesn't seem to bother in finding a match for me. So...I've found someone from your wife's family...please come... ...why don't you get me hitched with her. -Who's that? -It's that girl in blue dress. -I didn't notice -She's there... Hi dear...I Love You! Congratulations, have lotsa kids and be merry. When are you getting married? I'm wondering the same. It's Twenty five thousand for a vote, so keep them coming. -Brother... -Hmmm. -Have a drink... -Should I? -Just have one. -Ok done. I'll get a tummy with beer, will have quarter instead. Ok!?...Ok ready. Hey... ...what's happening here? -I did tell you... -give me that. Oh so she drinks too? Just have this small bottle. He's not a drunkard like you guys. Understood!? I have my husband hail and healthy. Oh!...oh..oh..oh! Hey Shiva, have that small bottle. -Ok dear. -Don't have these.. -Sure I won't -And don't hang around all the time... -Definitely I won't. -Ok!? Bye. Bye! Guys...! Where did she actually come from...? -It's his horoscope. -Oh! She doesn't seem to understand the drinks well. Oh my God!
