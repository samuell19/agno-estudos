Enjoy the movie. - Aim somewhere else. - Over there! - That's right. - [EVERYONE] Awh! More harpoons! Ready the nets, mate! Hoist and kill her before she comes aboard! - Let me see, let me see! Wait, wait, wait! - [EVERYONE] Awh! - She's a fast one! - Hand me another! - She's getting away! - From this angle. - Not even... - Release! - Again, captain? - [EVERYONE] Awh! - We missed her. No, Sullivan. Wayne, quickly. - She's right there. - Hey, hey! - Ace in one. - Move, move! Get back! - Why test the line...? - My turn! - What are you doing?! - It's a mermaid! - A mermaid?! Use your eyes! - Where is she? - Look, there. What were you thinking?! - These are dangerous waters. - And this is a dangerous time. Tonight's the Coral Moon. They say, this is when the Sea King calls his mermaid daughters together to lure men to their deaths. - Is that what they say? - Aye! Not even the strongest can resist their spell. Just an old lore. Back to work! - Alright. - Come on, lads. - See there? - See what, Hawkins? Crosswind gust kicked up the top, that's all. That's the Sea King's doing. He'd pull us under himself, if he could! - Raise the main! - The blindsight? Where's Prince Eric? Up on the bow, Sir Grimsby. Eric! What are you doing up there?! Get back here at once! You ought to stop worrying so much about me, Grimsby! Call me selfish, but I do not want to tell the Queen that her son fell overboard on my watch. And on his birthday, of all days. - Pull! - Let it out, let it out. Looks like there's a Spanish galleon out there, headed toward the mainland. We could follow it to port, see what they've brought to trade. Our ship is loaded to the gills as it is. We've risked our necks out here for seven weeks already. We're going home tonight. Eric, pay attention. I need you to be more careful. My daughters of the seven seas, I welcome news from all of your waters. Tamika, Perla... It's so good to see you. Caspia, Indira... It fills my heart to have you all here. Mala, Karina. Where is Ariel? Sebastian... You were supposed to see to it that Ariel was here. Oh... I tried, your Majesty. But that child, she is impossible. I reminded her about the gathering, just this morning. What more can one crustacean do? You can go find her. Yes, your Majesty. Right away. Yes, your Majesty. Right away, your Majesty. How hard can it be to find a mermaid, after all? If I'm lucky, I'll only have to search one ocean. Where are you, child? We aren't supposed to be this far from the palace, Ariel. Let's go back. Oh, how does that work? Come on, Ariel. Please? Oh, Flounder. Stop being such a guppy. I'm not a guppy. I think we've gone far enough. Wait, what is that? I've never seen that one. Come on! Ariel, wait for me! You know I can't swim that fast. Whoa, look at all that. They must have used this ship for battles or something. Yeah, great. Now let's get out of here. - Getting cold fins? - Who, me? No way. Good. Then you can stay out here and watch for sharks. Alright, good. What? Ariel, wait! Do you really think there might be sharks around here? Oh, Flounder. - Look at this. - Whoa. It's the smallest trident I've ever seen. I'm King Flounder, lord of the seven seas. I wonder why a human would need one that size. I bet Scuttle will know. She always does. Will you relax? It's just a reflection. Calm down. Nothing is going to happen. - Flounder, look out! - Aah! Flounder! You okay, Flounder? Sure, I mean... I've seen bigger sharks, just... You know, you can't back down. You gotta show 'em who's in charge. Come back, Flounder. It's just Scuttle. Ariel! Hey, kid, how you doing? Don't mind me, I was just grabbing a snack. Scuttle, we found more treasure. Yeah. We went into this sunken ship, and it was really creepy. Human stuff. A-ha. Alright, alright. Let me see, let me see. Any idea what this is? Oh, oh, oh, oh! Wow. This... This is, yeah... This is very, very unusual. What, what is it? It's a... It's a dinglehopper. - Dinglehopper? - Yeah, yeah. Humans use these babies to style their hair. You just, give it a little twirl, a little yanking, might get some pieces with it. And you're left with an artistically pleasing conflagration of hair that humans go nuts for. Really? I would love to see that. - Can't! - Flounder! You know it's true. Your father still won't let you go to the surface, huh? No, it's forbidden. He thinks all humans are, barbarians. No... They're not so bad. Unless you're a coconut. They hate coconuts. I swear, they get a hold of one, they smash it to pieces, just like that... It's weird. - And what's this? - Ariel! Spreading across a whole ocean looking for this child. Ariel! Ow! Sebastian! Sorry about that! Ariel! What are you doing up there? Wasting your time with this no-nothing bird - that can't tell swimming from flying. - Hey! I suppose you've completely forgotten tonight's the Coral Moon. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. The gathering of King Triton's daughters. Minus one. My father's gonna kill me. - Sorry, Scuttle. Gotta go. - Yeah, yeah. Alright, sweetie. Me too, gotta get some air. Yes, hurry home, Princess. We wouldn't want to be late for daddy's gathering, now, would we? Perhaps, I'll join them. Oh, wait... What a shame. It... It seems that big brother forgot to invite Auntie Ursula to the party. Again! Oh... I should be the one throwing the parties and not waiting on an invitation. Oh, the feasts we had when I lived in the palace. And now, look at me, family pariah, wasting away to practically nothing. Banished and exiled, driven halfway to madness... in this dim little crevice for 15 long years. While daddy and his spoiled little merbrats celebrate the Coral Moon. Well... I'll give them something to celebrate. I may have finally found daddy's weakness. Yes. Red's fascination with humans might be just the opening I've been waiting for. It is irresponsible. Your sisters are only here for one phase of the Coral Moon. Can you imagine any one of them missing the gathering? No, you're right. - I'm sorry. - It wasn't Ariel's fault. We, we were, we were exploring... - and a shark chased us. - Shark? So you went to the shipwrecks again. Those waters are dangerous. You don't have to worry about me. Well, I do worry, my little one. I do worry. This obsession with humans has to stop. I just want to know more about them. - You know all you need to know. - I barely know anything. You won't even let us go to the surface. Why do you have to be so strong-minded, just like your mother. - I am her daughter. - Yes... Foolish enough to be taken with the human world. - If you would just try to understand. - I have tried. I have tried to understand you long enough. But as long as you live in my ocean, you'll obey my rules. Do you understand that? Children... You give them an inch, they swim all over you. Was I too hard on her? Definitely not. It's like I always say. Children got to live by their parents' rules. - You're absolutely right, Sebastian. - Mmm. - My Ariel needs constant supervision. - Constant. - Someone to watch over her. - All the time, day and night. And you're just the crab to do it. I am just the crab to... No, wait, that's not, what? No, see, I serve you, your Majesty, as your honored majordomo. There's no better way you can serve me than to make sure my little one stays out of trouble. - But, I... - Yes? Go. Yes, your Majesty. How do I get myself into these situations? I'm an educated crustacean. I got options, and I need this. I should be advising the King, not chasing after some headstrong teenager. Ariel? Are you okay? He doesn't even hear me. I'm just not like him. I don't see things the way he does. And I... I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things can be so bad.

And behave in a manner more becoming of a future king. You mean, be more like my father was? - Cut off from the rest of the world? - Oh, Eric, you know what I mean. When you came to us 21 years ago, the king and queen took you in and treated you as one of their own. - Now that you've come of age... - Max... Max! What are you doing over there? Come here, boy. Come on. Go on. Now that you have come of age, your responsibilities are at home. - Your father would have expected that. - Yes... Trapped inside that castle in isolation and fear. I can't do it. - I believe a little fear may be advisable. - Grims, you're not listening. I want to be a different kind of leader. That's the whole reason we're on this voyage. Don't you see? We have to stay open to what's out here. That's the only way our island can grow. Eric, think what you risk. I can't explain it, Grims. It's in my blood. Even now, I... I feel there's something out here calling to me. The storm's coming in fast.

Didn't expect to find you here. And I really didn't expect to find her here. Hey, hey, hey. You listen to me, bird. The King can never hear of this. We are going to forget this ever happened. Ow! - Are you listening to me? - Yes.

All right, okay. As long as the King never finds out, everything will be all right. He never has to know she used that precious siren song of hers to save a human. I just have to find Ariel and get her back home. No, uh... She was around here somewhere. Ah... Ah, yeah. This, this must be it. I just have to be firm with her. Get her to see that this is all just a passing fad. And in time, she'll forget all about him. Ariel! - Sebastian, how did you find me? - What is all of this? What are you doing with that, that thing? Isn't it beautiful? Look at the longing in his eyes. What you know about longing? What is he doing here? It's from the shipwreck. I found him at Merman's Reef. - Bet there's so much more. - No... No, Ariel, Ariel... Child, get back here! Ariel! You have to let go of this obsession with humans. I'm not obsessed. I may be crusty, but I'm not blind. - I saw you the night of the shipwreck. - What? Your father wants you to stay as far away from them as possible. - But why? - You know why. We don't have to be afraid of them. I know that now. Sebastian, if you had just seen it up there. The ship rode on the wind, - and they filled the sky with fire. - Okay, okay, listen to me.

Somebody got to nail that girl's fins to the floor. Oh, don't tell me Eric is still going on about this girl who rescued him. I'm afraid so. - And the shipwreck, any casualties? - None, your Majesty. - Well, thank goodness no lives were lost. - Indeed. This restless nature of his, it concerns me. Undertaking these dangerous voyages. Oh, Eric, sit. Any sign of that girl yet, Grimsby? Have some breakfast, please. We looked, sire, but there was no girl. You were lucky to have made it ashore before you passed out. - She was real, she saved my life. - Sit down, Eric. I'm not hungry, Mother. I'm worried about you. You've not been yourself since the shipwreck. - Have you checked the neighboring islands? - Not all of them. - Then I will. - No, you will not. You're not leaving this castle until you're feeling better. I'll feel better when I find her. Do not think you're using this girl as an excuse to run off again. Risking your life on some trade ship for the sheer adventure? Sheer adventure? I'm trying to reach out to other cultures, so we don't get left behind. Did you know on this last trip, we traded alkane for 20 cases of quinine? - They use it in Europe to treat malaria. - And where are those 20 cases now? At the bottom of the sea. How many shipwrecks have there been in our waters this year, Prime Minister? Six, your Majesty. - Did you hear that, Eric? - Of course I did. Shipwrecks, hurricanes... The sea gods are against us. How many times do I have to... They are eroding our land from under us. Stealing it back into the ocean. They would kill us all if they could. - It's ridiculous. - Is it? May I remind you that a deadly shipwreck first brought you to us? And now, I almost lost you to one, the other day. We cannot keep tempting fate like this. It has got to stop. What? What does that mean? It means that... that your responsibilities are here now.

Ariel! Oh, yes, of course. Do these humans have any idea how much damage their shipwrecks do? I don't think they intended to have a shipwreck. They are careless, Ariel. It will take thousands of years for this coral to grow back. And they've killed nearly all of the sea fern. They'd kill us too if they had the chance. No, no, they're not all like that. Oh? How would you know? You've never even seen one. You were just a child when Mother died, and Father stopped us going to the surface. I just mean, we're not all the same, so why should humans be? What about humans? - I just mean... - Look at what their shipwreck did. They got what they deserved. They're the most dangerous species of all. Spoiling our waters, destroying the reefs. Having no respect for the balance of the oceans. They're not the only ones who have no respect for balance. Ariel, where are you...? What's going on with her? Well, she's just at that age when she doesn't want to hang out with her older sisters anymore. - Exactly. You remember what I was like. - How could we forget? Well, I wonder who the lucky merman is? The crown, your Majesty. Come over here, Sebastian. Breathe, Sebastian. Remember, guilty is as guilty acts. Don't overreact. Remain calm. Yes! Yes, your Majesty. Sebastian, have you noticed that Ariel has been acting peculiar lately? - Peculiar, sir? - Mhm. Distracted, daydreaming, disappearing for hours. You haven't noticed? Oh, well, I, um... Uh, I actually haven't... You know, um... - That is to say, I didn't, um... - Shh... Shh! - Sebastian... - Hm? I know you've been keeping something from me. - Keeping something? - Mhm! About Ariel. Ariel? Is my little one in love? Oh, I tried to stop her, sir! I tried to stop her from going to the surface. I told her to stay away from humans, but... Humans! Humans? Who said anything about humans? Let's just drop these things off and go back. No way. - With all that great stuff still down there? - Don't we have enough already? Ugh, come on, Flounder. We're just getting started. So, you broke the rules. You went to the above world. There was a shipwreck. A man was drowning. I had to save him. You should have let him drown. They're savages. You don't know that. They killed your mother. I know. But one man did. Why blame every human? - Mother wouldn't... - No. Enough. That's enough. - And Eric had nothing to do with it. - Eric? Eric? Have you lost your senses completely? You would have just heard him, Father. He's compassionate and kind. He's a human! You're a mermaid! Yes, but that doesn't make us enemies. Promise me you will never look for him again. I can't. - Promise me, Ariel. - I can't lie to you. I won't. I swear I will get through to you! No! Please! Father, stop! This ends now! Please! Stop it! It's for your own good! Father, no! Never leave again. - Ariel, I'm... - Just go away. Poor child. Poor sweet child. He can be so angry. He thinks he knows everything. Who are you? Oh, you must not remember me. I'm your Auntie Ursula. - The, the sea witch? - The what? What has your father told you about me? That... That you like to stir up trouble between humans and merpeople. Oh, is that what he said? I'm not half the monster he claims I am. And I'm only here to help. I don't need your help. Whatever you say, darling. - Wait! - Yes? How can you help me? Ariel! Where is she going with those slippery good-for-nothings? Let's go. Come in. Come in, child. You mustn't lurk in passageways. It's rude. Forgive my aggressive garden. I wouldn't choose to live like this. Believe me. Daddy's been so unfair to both of us. Controlling everything we say and do. In a way, we're the same, you and I. You don't seem at all like father described you. Is that right? Hmm. We never did get along. Squibling rivalry. He always got what he wanted, and what did I get? Nothing! Zip, nada, squat! Sound familiar, hun? Oh, I know what you're going through, believe me. And I know why you're here. - I'm not sure I do. - Oh, please! I've been watching you for a long time now, dearie. What you really want is to be up there, in the above world. It's always had your curiosity. And now, it's got your heart. What do you mean? You're so young. Don't you see? You're meant for each other. I can't bear to see you suffer like this. As it happens, I can help you. How? The problem is simple. You can't live in that world unless, you become a human yourself.

And not just any kiss. The kiss of true love. If you do, you will remain human permanently. But if you don't, you'll turn back into a mermaid. And you belong to me. - No, Ariel! - Shh! You understand, of course, that you'll have to... give up your mermaid gifts. You won't have this tail of yours, hanging around, dragging you down. You won't be able to breathe underwater. Who needs it? And you'll no longer have that siren song of yours. Because that wouldn't be fair now, would it? Don't worry. I'll keep it safe and soundness, here with me. We got a deal? I don't know. Well, I might as well just give you the premium package, kid. No. Life's full of tough choices, innit? No. This is wrong. I can't do this. Fine, then! Forget about the world above.

Ha! And just in case, I slipped a little something extra into that spell of mine. No matter how hard that girl tries, she won't remember she needs to get that kiss. Now it's just a matter of time.

Now you're taking boat rides? That rotten sea witch, she stole Ariel's voice. Hey, Flounder. What are you talking about? So Sebastian told Triton, that Ariel saved a human. - and Triton got so mad - Okay, okay. - Explanations later, man. - And, then... Wait. - We got to get you out of here. - Wait! - I didn't tell you about the sea witch. - Bye-bye. And don't tell anyone about the sea witch. Something about you seems different. Don't tell me. It's your hairdo, right? Because you've been using the dinglehopper, no? I can't, I can't quite figure it out. But I know that if I stand here for long enough. She got legs, ya idiot! You know, we've discussed this. I don't like it when you call me an idiot. Why don't you tell me something nice? - "Hey, Scuttle, your feathers look good." - Shoo! Here you are. It'll have to do for now. I'll take you to the castle. They'll know what to do with you there.

Eh, no, don't ya turn your back on me. What were you thinking? Choosing to give up your mermaid gifts? Now, if we could just get that witch to give them back, then you could go home and just be... Uh... And just be... Just be miserable for the rest of your life. Oh my, what a soft shell I am turning out to be. Alright... Alright, I'll try to help ya. But we've got to be bold, act quickly, don't forget about the kiss. Ah, no, no, not me, the Prince! You gotta kiss the Prince. Don't you remember? You only have three days to... Hello? Oh no, she's put a spell on you. You can't remember, can you? Now what are we gonna do? Well, we got no time to lose, We just gotta find a way to get the two of you together. You are hopeless, child, you know that? Completely hopeless. Aw, perfect! Ooh, a buffet. What, no nuts? What are you doing here? Oh, there you are, I've been looking for you. Flounder told me the whole story. Has Ariel killed the Prince yet? Not "killed", "kissed", ya bird brain. And it's worse than we thought, the witch has placed a spell on her. Soon as I tell her she's got to kiss him, the thought jumps clear right out of her head. - So now it's up to us. - To kiss the Prince? - Forget it. - Where's Ariel now? What do you mean, she's right here. Oh. What are you doing in here, child? You can't just go wandering around wherever you please. - Hide! - Who's in here? Oh, it's you. Nobody usually comes in here. My little mermaid. It's alright, it's alright. You can look at it. I found her on the coast of Cartageña. Isn't she beautiful? Oh, that's right, you... Well, it really doesn't matter. Most people around here use too many words and have nothing to say. You know, I never believed all that lore. Mermaids luring sailors to their deaths. Here. Take her. No, really, I want you to have her. I'm running out of space as it is. Nearly all of these things come from my voyages. I know it must seem silly, collecting all this stuff, but... Just look at this fossilized sea stone. Can you believe that such amazing things exist down there? No, wait! How did you know that was in there? All this time? It's incredible. - Oh, that? - Hey, girl. That I just picked up from the beach here on the island. There's loads of them in this time of year. I had no idea you could do that. Oh, me? No, oh, really? Alright, and... How do I...? Yeah, that's it, that's it, girl. Go get it, go get it, I see ya. Go on, come now... Oh. Alright. Yeah, well... I'll work on that. I love the people there. Their culture, their custom. This whole region is known as the Brazilian Empire. And there's Venezuela, Colombia. Oh, the area up here is called Mosquito Coast. Those waters are all uncharted. Wouldn't it be amazing to discover some place no one's ever seen before? Ah, but this... This was one of my favorite voyages. I brought that Peruvian rug there, along with six of the looms they used to make it. Oh, another one. All right. Ah... This is our island. We're in that very castle right now. Over here's our main village. Our port there was once the busiest in the region. I'm hoping it will be again one day. And there's a beautiful lagoon with a little waterfall right here. And then all of that, is rainforest. I could show you around, if you like. All right. - We'll go tomorrow. - But, sire. Oh, Grimsby, good. We'll need a horse and carriage ready for us in the morning. May I have a quiet word, sire? Of course. He's a special one, isn't he? And that moonlight, ah! We were going to send out all the carriages tomorrow to look for the girl. The girl... Oh, I wasn't thinking. Of course, yes. We must do that. Absolutely. And I must remind you, Eric, what your mother said yesterday about you not leaving the castle - until you're feeling better. - Grimsby, I feel fine. I feel better than ever. Yes. Yes, I can see that. I suppose we could spare one carriage. Looks like you made a friend there. Come on, Max. We'll see you later. Oh, no. You're not going without me. Only got two days left. I'm a crab on a mission. Trot on, Peter. I'm getting too old for this. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Down, beast. I still got it. Who is that riding out with Prince Eric? Is that the girl who washed up the other day? Yes, it is, Lashana. Didn't the queen tell him to stay in the castle? Yes, she did, Lashana. Aren't you going to get into trouble for fetching him a carriage? What carriage, Lashana? Do you want to try? Here. Look out! Look out! Sorry about that! That was close. Whoa! Get out! Get out of the way! - Turn! - Look out! That was fun. Let me give you a hand. Here we go. This way, come on. This way. Here we go. Go on, that's it. Thank you, lad. Island berry? Oh, is it pretty? - Whoa! - Coconut! - Fresh fruit! - Coconut! Fresh coconut? No? You don't want it? Got some water here. Thank you, miss. Young lady, would you like to try some? Oh, I think you'll be needing this. You want this? - Thank you. - Good day, sire. Hat for the lady? Oh, there you are. Oh. No, no. Too big. Try this. Tropical flowers? Hey. Hey! Everybody, everybody! Way, hey. Hey, hey! - Say, any kissing yet? - No. When it comes to romance, these two are slow as snails. Hey, go find Flounder. We got to move this thing along, and quick. Okay, bossy. Hey! Pick it up! Bring it here, bring it here, bring it here, y'all! Back it up, back it up, back it up! Woo! Hey! Come on, now! I love this time of night. Sometimes you'll see the eyes of a screech owl... - Up in the tree. - Hey! Hey! Hey, come back with that! Come on! I think it went this way. You alright? Hey! Give me my hat back! Oh, all right then. I didn't want to lose this. Move your big fat feathers, bird. I can't see a thing. - Well, that worked pretty good, didn't it? - But nothing's happening. We're running out of time and no one's puckered up once. I think it's time for a little vocal romantic stimulation. Please, no. - Scoot over? - Me, me, me, me, me, me, me. - You gotta be... - Bow-chicka-wow-wow! - Chicka-wow-wow! - Shh! Chicka-wow! - Wow-wow-wow! - Alright, gosh! - I was off, I was off on that one. - No... Let me find it. Let me find it. - Wow! - You're finished? - Wow. - Alright, alright. Listen! Ariel cannot know we're helping. If she sees or hears us, she'll shut us down. Nah, man. We got to be sneaky about this. We got to work on the Prince, using the power of suggestion. Good. How are we going to do that? We got to blend in with the sounds of nature so she doesn't hear us. Percussion. Strings. Winds.

I'll see him wriggle like a worm on a hook. So where is she? - We don't know, father. - She's gone. What do you mean she's gone? We've been looking and looking. There's no sign of her anywhere. She's not in these waters. Then, look again. Search all of the seven seas, if you have to. - Ariel wouldn't dare go above... - Don't get him think such a thing. It doesn't make sense. Why would she leave? I... I have no idea. Never mind that. Just find her. What have I done? Everyone's asleep. We should probably be quiet. - His room, all day? - Wait. - Go, go, go. Come on, then. - I haven't seen him. I would imagine, he's just resting. - Has he been avoiding me? - No, your Majesty. - No? - No. You seem awfully certain. Avoiding you, doesn't seem like Eric, does it? Then where is he? Oh, he's not searching for that fantasy girl, I hope. No, your Majesty. That, I can say with certainty. Thank heavens for small blessings. Ooh! Oh! - Ooh, it's wet. - No, no. I'll look into it. You really must get some rest yourself. Yes, I suppose I should. Thank you, Grimsby. Good night. Sorry about that. I wasn't supposed to leave the castle today. But I'm glad I did. All these rules. The truth is, I wasn't born to all this. It all makes me feel a little uncomfortable... - Welcome back, sire! - Oh, Grimsby. I trust you two have had a pleasant outing. Yes, we did, didn't we? Yes, very nice. You've had a long day, miss. I imagine we should let you get some sleep. And perhaps dried off as well. Oh, yes. We took a rowboat out onto the lagoon, and I'm afraid we ended up in it. Anyway, good night. Good night. Ariel. About the carriages, sire. I'm afraid they, didn't find the mystery girl. They didn't? Oh. May I then ask, should we continue the search? Grimsby, I'm... Just... I feel a little... Well, if you want the advice of an old man, sire, don't be held back by what you think should be. Think only of what is.

Oh! My goodness. - It is wonderful news, isn't it, Grimsby? - Oh, yes. I must admit, I was mistaken. It seems you really have found the girl of your dreams, after all. Yes... Quite the surprise, Eric. What? Oh, I know. I know it must seem fast, but... But I do owe her my life. We will celebrate, this evening. You shall introduce your intended to the court. We can make that happen, can't we, Grimsby? Yes... If it's really what you want, Eric. What I... want? It's... It's what we both want. Lovely. - Well, we've got our work cut out for us. - Indeed. - Then let's begin preparations. - Straight away. Oh, Ariel, girl... Where have you gone? - Hey, any sign of her? - No luck. I flew over the village three times. What? Check the castle again. It's almost sunset. We've got to find her. - Copy that. - What's wrong with that fool, Prince? Something fishy going on here. - I don't like the smell... eh? - Sebastian, over here. Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming. Hold on. Yes, what? - I think I know where Ariel is. - What? Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go, let's go, let's go. Ariel? So long, Red.

You can't give up so easily. This all has to be some sort of misunderstanding. I watched both of you, you're meant to be together. There you are, I've been looking. And I thought I found you 'cause I heard, but then I saw it wasn't you, it was her. But it wasn't in the mirror, except she had your voice. What are you talking about? - Don't you get what I'm telling you?! - No! The Prince has been tricked. That lady who showed up is actually the sea witch in disguise. - What? Are you sure about this? - Of course, I'm sure! Have I ever been wrong? I mean, like, you know, when it counts? - Well, what are we gonna do? Well, we have to do something before Prince Eric ends up with that slimy squid. Yes, girl, go! Flounder, go tell the Sea King what's happened. - He has to know everything. - Okay. - What do I, what do I, what do I do? - You give me a lift to the castle. We've got to find a way to stall that engagement. Heroism's too strong a word for it, I suppose I did save Eric. Just what anyone would do. - Grimsby. - Sire. Have you seen Ariel? According to the servants, she left the castle early this morning. Left? Can you blame her, Eric? I don't understand. This is not like you. I'm not sure I understand it myself. I... I just wanted to. - I thought... - Eric? Don't really know what I wanted. Almost there. Now, when I give the signal, you drop me. - Got it? - Got it. No, you idiot! Guess I'm on my own. My darling... This belonged to my mother, and I'd like you to have it. Your happiness means everything to me. You're very sweet. Well, would you excuse me? Enjoy yourself. Oh, Eric. It's beautiful. The ring... The ring, I lost it. Has anybody seen the ring? Have you seen my ring? Have you seen it? Get off me, you filthy bird! Help me! I'm being attacked! Ariel... Ariel, I've been looking for you. Who is that? What are you doing? - Let me go! - Sire! Get away from me! She's insane! - Let me go! - Eric! Get off! Ariel? Yes. It was you all along. I should have known. I don't know what came over me. She bewitched you. Get away from her! - Eric, I want you to know, I... - Just kiss! - I want you to know everything. - Nothing matters now. No! Oh, good Lord, she's a sea creature. You're too late! - Stay back! - Shut up! Eric! Eric? No, this is the work of the sea gods. I warned you, their whole world is evil. Eric, wait! Eric! What are you doing? Let go of me! Not a chance! You made a deal, remember? Three days, no kiss? Yeah, is it all coming back to you? I thought so. Well, now you gotta live with it, toots. Ursula! Let her go. Forget it, big brother! She belongs to me now. Oh, you see? We made a deal. In blood. It's unbreakable. Even for you. I'm sorry, Father. This is all my fault. What do you want with my daughter? Oh, nothing. It's you I want. I wanna see you suffer, like I've suffered all these years. And the daughter of the great Sea King is a very precious commodity. Poor unfortunate soul. Hey! Get her, boys! Uh-uh, I wouldn't. Shocking, isn't it? Of course, I always was a gal with an eye for a bargain. What do you say to a trade, hmm? What's your precious little Ariel worth to ya? It's mine now. No! Father! You... You monster! Don't be a fool, you little brat! You are powerless against... You're gonna pay for that. Get him! Say goodbye to your human heartthrob! No! No... My babies! - Eric! - Yeah? Get to shore, she'll kill you! I'm not leaving you! Yes! Give me your hand! Now! Look out! Now I rule the seas and all will be helpless under my power! So much for true love. So long, lover boy! You gave your life for me. And you fought to get my life back. I didn't fight alone, father. Eric was with me. All that matters now is that you're safe, and home. Where you belong. - Sire, please! - We need a boat. Grimsby, we have to find her! And then what? And then what, Eric? Son. You were right. - I was chasing after a fantasy girl. - No, no, I was wrong. She was very real. And so were your feelings for her, I see that now. It's just that... Our worlds were never meant to be together. Sebastian! You gotta be kidding me. Yes, your Majesty. I have always tried to do what's best for our people. Yes, your Majesty. And what's best for my daughters. Indeed, your Majesty. And I've done everything in my power to make her happy. Well, not quite. She wants a different life than I had planned for her. She did try to tell you, your Majesty. But I won't be able to protect her anymore. Well, it's like I always say. Children got to be free to lead their own lives. - Oh, is that what you always say? - Something like that, yeah. Then there's just one problem left. And what's that, your Majesty? How much I'm going to miss my little one. Good boy. Come on. Again? Max? Oh, what's all this, Grims? Oh, the queen wanted the two of you to have a proper send-off, sire. - Thank you, your Majesty. - No, thank you. Much as I hate farewells, we still have cause to celebrate. Our worlds have misunderstood one another for far too long. Your marriage marks a new beginning for us. Yes, a beginning. Now, get out there, change the world, or whatever it is you have to do, so we don't get left behind. That doesn't sound like my mother. - What have you done with her? - Oh! Off we go. Have you decided where you're headed first? - Uncharted waters. - Okay. A mermaid and a man... Whoever would have imagined? Well, look who's here. - We got you something, Ariel. - Sure did. - Something you almost lost. - What? Where? - Where is it? - You're sitting on it, bird. Ow! My little mermaid. Keep her for me. I hope she causes you less trouble than I did. I was right about the dinglehopper, wasn't I? Yes, you were, Scuttle. You were! You won't be gone too long... - Will you, Ariel? - Of course not. I'll be back by the next Coral Moon. Yeah, don't be late this time. You ready? Yes. Yes, I'm ready. My child. Eric. Thank you for hearing me. You shouldn't have had to give up your voice to be heard. But now I am listening. And I will always be here for you. We all will. I love you, father. ♪ The seaweed is always greener ♪
