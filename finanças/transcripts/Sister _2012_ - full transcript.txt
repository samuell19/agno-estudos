So, what do you think? Can you turn some, please? A bit more. A little bit more, again. Okay, okay! Well? You look good. You've got a nice ass, I think. Oh, you're stupid! - Is it the same? - This is the one you told me about. How much of the Giant Slalom is left? I know there's more. How much, how do you know? - You'll give me the rest of the money? - Come on, Simon! You got a new oven, that's not enough? - Hi. - Hi. There's no milk here? What will you do... with these skis? If I get a chance, I'll sell them. Oh yeah? This is good stuff. It's yours, that red BMW? Yes, why, you saw it? It accelerates well? Okay, yeah, it runs well. I can get you a price. What is your level of skiing? - Hi. - Hi. Are you okay? Your brother's trying to sell me skis. That's how he gets pocket money.. Is there any coffee? Where do you live normally? - At my parents. - They're far away? Yeah, far enough. It's a bit like the Bronx, our family. It comes, it goes. It's true. Our family is crap. I left her floundering so she'll learn faster. - You've already sat in a BMW? - No, never. There's still some work to do here. Go ahead, get in. - Get in. - No, he'll block me. He'll be very small. - It can reach 240, your car? - Well, yeah. You see, it's affordable. - But how will I pay? - We can make arrangements. And it'll help you find a better job. - You think so? - Uh-huh. And it's a Toyota. It's indestructible. Incredible. I'll check the underbody. Can we get you something for tonight? No, this is good. This isn't my sister, she's my mother. What did you say? This isn't my sister, she's my mother. He says he's your brother? Louise, what did he say? This isn't my sister, she's my mother. What did he just say? No, but wait, Louise! Say something, Louise! Louise, hey! This kid will say anything. You shouldn't have brought him. You're done saying anything! What do you take me for? What is this crap? What's the fuss about? What is this crap? He said that to piss me off. She's lying! There's a problem. I'll let you two off to discuss it. I would have told you. What does it change? What does it change? Can't you see the difference? For you, it changes nothing? But you're crazy, both of you! You, get out immediately, I don't want to see you anymore. Out! You, too. You, too. I would have told you. I would have told you, I swear. You would have told me, when? You were going to tell me? It was him who had to tell me. You're completely sick. Get out. Get out. It's your fault. It's your fault! Why did you do that? Huh? Why did you do that? Did you have to say that now? You're a drag! For twelve years you've been a drag! Do you hear what I'm saying? I can do nothing with you! Never, do nothing with you! Always nothing! Stop following me like a dog! Stop it, now! It's you, who's the drag. You do nothing! Even your jeans, it's me who paid for them. Do you hear me? Can I sleep with you? - I can't sleep with you? - No. Why not? You can't, that's all. And if I pay you one hundred? One hundred fifty. Are you okay? Fuck off! Twenty... - Fifty... - Stop it. One hundred... One hundred ten... One hundred thirty... One hundred fifty... Wait, I still have a little bit more. One hundred sixty... One hundred eighty... One hundred eighty. Can I sleep with you now? Hey, sis. Two hundred. Two hundred? Two hundred. Okay. I don't have that much. Hand it over. It's okay, come on. Would you hold me? Where should I put my head? I didn't want you, Simon. Why did you keep me, then? I don't know. To not be alone. And to piss someone off. No one wanted me to keep you. What? No one? No, no one. You know, the money is for real. You can keep it. I don't care, really. It suits me, being your brother. You think she's asleep? - She's drunk! - Madame, Madame... Madame! I think she's drunk! Would you help me carry her? She's well built, your sister. - Damn! - What? She blew all our money. What are you doing? Turn around. Wow! Fabulous! Wow! Did you see that jump? Shall we? Wait, there's a guy about to do a trick! You're wasting time, "Blue Hands"! Did you come along to do anything? Come on. Will we ski this afternoon? Put on your ski mask. I can't, it itches. Put it back on and keep it on, even if you get caught. - Grab small things. - Okay. - You know the good brands? - Yeah, you think I'm stupid? Put on your gloves! You sure it's safe here? Hello! How old are you, Marcus? - What did he say? - He asked your age. - Say ten. - Ten. - Ten. - Ten. You're ten? You look like a baby. What did he say? - That you're a baby. - What an idiot! Why did you bring a little boy up here? Why him? - He helps me. - He's a fucking baby! This is over Simon! It doesn't work like this! What am I supposed to do with these, huh? Start a nursery? This is wrong, okay. This is wrong, it's going too far. You're losing your fucking mind, alright. ...And take these and get out of here. Go! Take 'em back wherever you got 'em. Take the baby home. Go alright! I don't want to see you anymore. It's finished! No more skis! Is he taking them or not? Shut up! Go home! Now! It stinks here. - Can't we go to the restaurant? - You got the money? And we haven't even skied. - I don't even know, how to ski. - You're kidding! This is pointless, it's just small change. - Hey, baby. - You're stupid! Pass me a sandwich. - Meat or cheese? - Anything else? I'm keeping the other one. - For your sister, what's she doing? - What is it you're doing? What's she do for a living? Is she a whore or what? Ow! It's not from me, that's what my brother says. I'm taking a dump, Mister. Open up! Get out of there! Alright then. I didn't do anything, Mister! I was taking a dump. I swear. Well, look at that!

Farther! Hi. Do you have anything to eat? I've got nothing. Wait, I'll see. I'll cook. Who's the kid? My brother. He helps me. Good enough. You want to sit on my knees? Simon, what you are looking for there? - Don't steal anything, huh? - Okay. I'll pay you back. Pay me back what? What you lent me. Why? I don't care. I don't want to owe you anything, Simon. Here, take this. Take it. Go on, take it, there. Take it, listen! Come along. - Can I raid the fridge? - No, not here. The owners are there. What can I do then? Go help Maria instead. Hello! Miss?

Okay, can we go? - What you got? - Nothing. Where did you know the owner from? What do you care? I'm done. Can you ask the boy to come here? Simon? Can you come over here, for five minutes? There was a watch in the bathroom. It's no longer there. Do you have it? I didn't take it myself. I didn't even see it. And your brother? - Simon? - No. Empty your pockets. That's all you got? Are you sure? You're a motherfucker, Simon. You can go now. Leave. Drop dead! I don't want you! I don't want you! Give. Give. - You're still here? - Just leaving. - Get out of here. - Will do. Hey! Watch where you're walking, I just mopped here. - Hey, goodbye. - Goodbye. The key is there. Hey! Look guys, here's the little thief. - Where are you going? - Find another work. It's over here. Can I come? How old are you? Fifteen. ...and you want to do what? I can do stuff. Come on, come on, let's hurry! I'm paying overtime! Last dump load in half an hour! I know you... You're back, you couldn't stop yourself. Come on, get the hell out. Get out of here! Come on, kid.
