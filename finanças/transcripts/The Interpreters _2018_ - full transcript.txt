- The American forces, they call us interpreters. - He says that there is IED. Someone told me that there is IEDs in this field. - We interpret what they say to our soldiers and what the soldiers say to our people. When I start working with the US Army, I was trying to help them to help us, because we spend our lives suffering because of Saddam regime. We have to be the point of contact between Army and local nationals. - Americans couldn't do anything in Iraq or Afghanistan without local people. They did not speak the language. They did not know the lay of the land. We were deaf and blind. - Move! - Don't you understand these people's lives are in danger as we speak? They've been marked for death. They're gonna die! They're gonna be killed! - That is where we're going. That's Iraq. - As you can see, we are literally in the middle of nowhere. But the only cool part about this place, it's got some killer sunsets. See you later. - As American soldiers, we had difficulty communicating with the Iraqis. - That's why we came here today. - It was common for us to employ local nationals or other Iraqis that would serve as an interpreter or a translator for the soldiers. The interpreters were considered to be traitors to their country, traitors to their religion. They'd either had to wear a mask over their face and always use a fake name. But after a while, people found out who they were. We kept hearing reports of an interpreter turning on the soldiers, helping coordinate an attack or a suicide bomb and blowing himself up and killing soldiers. Several interpreters were offered to us. We can't call an interpreter by their real name. And that's when he lit up his cigarette and said, "You will call me Phillip Morris." And that's how we ended up with his name. - You know, he came with his mohawk. With his gray hair, with his full gear, with his rifle. And he gave me this serious look. "If you try to mess with me or my soldiers I will kill you." - And he starts to laugh. And I'm like, "What do you think is so funny about this?" And he said, "Someday, you and I will sit in America and laugh at this conversation over tea." - After you spend 16 hours a day with somebody every day, you're either gonna hate them or you're gonna like them. And Phillip is just one of those likeable people. - I never thought I would ever become friends like this with an Iraqi. - He's my brother from another mother, really. He's my man. He's the man. - Things would have been a lot worse if we didn't have interpreters working for us. And Phillip was the best one I've ever came across. - We will have our combat troops out of Iraq. - I told Braun, I told him, "Dude, when you leave, what's gonna to happen to me?" - When I said my good-byes to Phillip, it was the unknown of, is he gonna be alive in the next six months because of how he helped us? - Within days of the last U.S. troops leaving Iraq, a wave of violence swept through-- - Violence in Iraq has reached the highest it has seen in years-- - The powerful armed group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is already in control of several cities. - Iraq is now in the grip of a crisis as bad as anything since the Americans left. - Here's a man who became my brother that we needed to get out of that situation. What is it going to take to be able to bring an interpreter and his family to the United States? - "To whom this may concern, "This letter is in reference to Khalid Awda, "also known by his interpreter name of Phillip Morris. "I am honored to have worked so closely with him. "I can say that I can think of no better person to be allowed entry into the United States." - I wrote a long article in "The New Yorker" about Iraqis who were being hunted down. I've never really reported anything that made me so deeply angry and felt personally, in some ways, implicated as an American. Those who worked either directly or indirectly for the U.S. government, I found that these Iraqis who supported and trusted us most now feel abandoned by us. It was Senator Ted Kennedy's office that proposed the idea of a fast track visa. And Congress pushed it through. - All those in favor? all: Aye. - All those opposed? The bill is passed. - I made a promise. I'm gonna help him get here with his family. You're not really prepared for this long of a journey. How many years it takes, and how many phone calls it's been. How many letters and emails we've had to write. This is Paul. - Yeah, he was actually my interpreter when I was over there 2009, 2010. And if it wasn't for him, I would not be here having this conversation with you, so-- - Four and a half years, we've went on that. - The process took over four years. It was a very long four years. He sent me a text. It was a picture of him holding up his visa. Just the look on his face and his passport, and like, "I got it." And it was like, "Where are you?" And he's like, "I'm at home." "Get to Basra as fast as you can. We need to fly you out now." - I don't want to spend my life far away from my family. You know what I mean? I have my wife and my son. He's about 19 years old. And I have three girls. Nine, seven and three years old. - It's hard to stay with my family, because I'm the target. - Phillip is actually in Doha, Qatar right now. In a couple hours, he'll be getting on a plane. He'll be here tomorrow night at 9:00 p.m. - No. - Aw. - Tell him to fly to Mexico, and he can walk right across. - I know, I know. It's seriously that simple. - Yeah. - But for them to be here-- But for them to be here legally-- - Oh, no. Obama will just let them in. - I know. - Yeah. - For Phillip, being on a special immigration visa allows his immediate family members to be able to come to the United States. So there is a process for it to happen, but unfortunately, it's so slow. And if they find him with his family, they won't hesitate to kill all of them. - Oh, hi. - Hello there. - How you doing, Mom? - I'm good, I'm good. I have never known another Muslim before this. - Or Iraqi. - Or Iraqi for that matter. Cheese! - I think in some ways, we're his stand-in family here in America. He's really contributed warmth to our family, but also opening up our viewpoint beyond our Christian background, which has been rather narrow here in this community. - He took me to Mall of America. And kind of band singing the hallway downstairs. Everyone, like, just watching this. No fear. They're having fun, you know what I mean? We stopped having fun like this long time ago back at home. I'm going back to Iraq to bring my family, and it will be like... a new chapter in my life. I want my family to get this chance like what I got. - What's really setting off alarm bells in the administration tonight is what's happening outside Baghdad. As you mentioned, this military base, overrun by ISIS. It's on the highway leading to Baghdad, which is raising concerns that the militants could get full control of Anbar province. General Martin Dempsey gave an interview on ABC... - Hi. - Hi. - How are you, sir? - What's going on here? - See you, brother. Everything is going crazy in Iraq. Sorry to say that, but there's no future there. Actually, I was born in same year when Saddam taking over Iraq. So I know no one except Saddam. He been president in 1979. I was like six years old. You know back in Saddam, we don't have cell phones. We don't have internet. We have just one channel. You know, the government channel. And the economy back then, it was really bad. It was tough. I'm so appreciate to America get rid of Saddam. But to be honest, back then, we don't have fear about car blowing up or any bomb in the street. But now, now we have to deal with unsecure situation in my country. ISIS, the militia. If no one stop them, they get in Baghdad, I think there is no more Iraq. A, B, C, D, E, F, G H! I! L! J! - K, K! - Hi! - Superman. - Last night, he slept with Superman. - I saw the picture, yes. My name is Stella Chiarelli, and I'm a volunteer working in the refugee crisis. Right now, my work is helping families to find their missing relatives. He has three children. Two of them are missing with his wife, but he has hope that they are alive. - Morning, Fran. - Morning, Paul. How are you? - Good, guys. How are you? - So what have you heard from Phillip? - Uh, just the same as always. He kind of gets on Facebook, just likes a few things. I haven't really heard anything in the last two weeks, but-- - Yeah. - Hopefully soon. We've gone weeks without making a connection. You get to the two-week point, and you think, "Wow, we're just past 10 days. We're at two weeks. We'll hear something soon." And then, you approach the third week. And now, you know that something's not right. - Good morning, butthead. Well, we keep watching the news and seeing how things keep getting worse over there. - You're gonna get your passports when? OK - All right. Be careful. - Good morning. It's about 4:00 a.m. And I'm walking to the car park to get a taxi going to Baghdad. - Glad to have you back, brother. Until we get your family here. - I brought something for you guys, for the shop. - All right. - It's kind of our culture. You know envy? You know envy? - Envy, yeah. - Envy. Yeah, that protects you from envy. Supposed to. - Have a good day, guys. - That was good. - See you. - Mr. Trump, in December, you said this. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice. Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? - The Muslim ban is something that, in some form, has morphed into extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they're coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. People are coming into our country, like-- we have no idea who they are, where they're from, what their feelings about our country are. - Phillip and his family are good people. They're really good people. Maggie! What's it gonna be like for his children when they come here? Come on. Watch out. People right now have a distant, standoffish fear towards the Muslim community. Come on in. All right, you girls get some sleep. Because we don't understand that there's good Muslims as there's bad Muslims. All we see are focused on the bad ones. - 56-year-old Rose Hamid was escorted out and booed by the crowd, as you see right there. She spoke with us about her experience and the people around her in the rally. - You know, I don't know if he really knows what Muslims stand for. So that was really my goal, was to let people see that Muslims are not that scary. - He's literally stand up and say, "Okay, I don't want Muslims in America. I don't want Mexican or Latino or all the immigrants." Basically, he stand up and he said, "All Muslims they are my enemy and this country's--" No. He's wrong. He's wrong. - It was at 2:00 a.m. I thought it's just a junk e-mail like every single day. The first thing on the screen says, like, U.S. Embassy. I went to work and a couple of my co-workers, they were, like, always tracking my case, asking me what's going on. So I turn on my phone and I showed her the e-mail. - Yay! So wait a minute. - Yes. My family got the visa. I'm still dreaming. But I hope this dream come true when I hug them. When they are here. Seven days until my family comes here. Seven days. Seven days! Laughing I'm looking for a house, but there is, like, kind of religion problem. Racist problem. I don't know, man. One of the people who I called, she asked me, "What's your name, sir?" I told her my name. Khalid Awda. And she said, "Where are you from?" "I'm from Middle East." "Which part of Middle East?" "I'm from Baghdad." She said, "Uh... "I'm sorry. I can't." I told her, "What do you mean?" She said, "I can't rent the house." Finally I found a lady. She's so nice, and I will sign the lease after tomorrow. I'm planning to make a huge speech with my kids when they come here. Explain for them there is a lot of ignorant people, like everywhere. So just prepare. You hear something hurt your feeling, make you disappointment, it's not the end of the world. - Bye, bye, Shaheen! - Yep, that's them. - That's them? - That's them. - Hello! - Hello! Hello! - From this day forward, it's going to be only America first. America first. I'm establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. - The latter order temporarily halts the flow of refugees into the United States and stops all entry from some predominantly Muslim nations. - This isn't specifically singling out people with extremist ties. This is a blanket ban. - No hate! No fear! Refugees are welcome here! No hate! No fear! Refugees are welcome here! No hate! No fear! Refugees are welcome here! - Let them in! Let them in! - Refugees are welcome here! - We are concerned about the issue, Chuck. But you bring up a good point. Perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward. - The anticipation overwhelming before Naqibullah Malikzada's arrival. - Supporters here in the community will help Malikzada and his family resettle here in Rochester. Now, the organization No One Left Behind tells us that about ten thousand other people are waiting for a similar visa to move to America. - For a safe and comfortable trip, we would like to give you some safety information. We would like to remind you that the life jackets are in the cabin as marked. Thank you, and have a nice journey. - Once a country decides to enter another country by force, to change its government, to change, in some ways, its culture for its own foreign policy, national security reasons, it takes on a responsibility more awesome than the politicians and the ordinary people of our country can fathom. These interpreters are just the nearest example of the full load we've taken on. And yet, it's done without thought and then it's shrugged off without thought. They need us to be better than we are. And some of them seemed to believe in our mission more than we did. - I'll find you! - Yay! - All I hope for them is to get out. I don't imagine they are going to stay and build a new Afghanistan or the new Iraq. It's too late for them. They need to get somewhere safe.
