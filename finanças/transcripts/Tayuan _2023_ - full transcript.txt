But I'll make it right this time because I'm already sure more than ever. Is this what you really want? Yes. [sobbing continues] ♪ [somber music playing] ♪ ♪ [somber music continues] ♪ ♪ [music fades] ♪ What are you doing there? It’s already 10:30 in the morning, sis. Don't disturb me. What’s that for? I will redecorate. This is the only break we have. Stop working your ass off. Ella, I know what you’re doing. Make it right! What? What do you mean what? Get drunk! Cry if you want to! Come on, let’s drink! But we have to make this right. Let’s talk about this. Talk to me! Mags, this is the only way I want! This is the only way I can! This is the only way for me to make things right after everything that I’ve done wrong! You know what? I shouldn’t have let him be part of my life, my world! But I did! So now, from the bathroom to the bedroom, even in the garage, I remember him everywhere! It's always him! What should I do? I’m so stupid. I’m just here. We’ve got this. And before you know it, it’s all in the past. [sobbing] It's okay. You can do this. I'm just here for you. I’ve got this, we’ve got this. I’m just really stupid sometimes. I’m sorry, sis. Hi! Yes, Mrs. Tan. Yes, I already talked to the supplier of flowers. Yes, I got it all good. Yes, thank you! Bye! Ella? Harold? Hi! You look good! How are you? I’m actually doing good. Loving what I do. What about you? I’m running my own firm now. Well, firm of my in-laws, actually. - I see. - Yup! Married. Dad of two. Good for you! Do you have something to say? Well, Ella, I never got to talk to you properly. I’m really sorry for hurting you before. I was an asshole. You’re right. I deserve that. But Harold, why did you leave me? We’ve been together for so many years. I thought you were happy with me, but you fell for somebody else. What were my shortcomings back then? Actually, nothing. Back then, it was just me. Oh wow. “It’s not me, it’s you”? What a cliché! But that’s the truth. It’s not always about you. No matter how kind or good you are, people would always choose whatever they think is right at that moment. Even if they are wrong in what they think is right. So, what was right for you back then? That if I got attracted to another girl after all those years with you, I think there must be really something wrong with us. That’s why I tried it with another girl. Such a jerk, right? Yes. It’s just hard to accept the fact that there was nothing I could do even if I wanted to. Yup. Stupid people make stupid choices. You’re lucky enough if you find your match and you know that you’re both at the right time, right place, and right circumstance. So, Ella, you don’t have shortcomings. We just met at the wrong time. Thank you for making things clear. Shit! I forgot, my car is on coding today. ♪ [dramatic music playing] ♪ Ella... Please give me a minute, Ella. I’ve been coming back here for four months, hoping you would pass by because I really don’t have the courage to go to your house. So, what now? I’m just taking my chances. If ever we meet here, I might believe that maybe we’re destined, maybe we still have another chance. Ella, I missed you. Even now that you're already in front of me, I still miss you. And my feelings for you hasn’t changed. It even got stronger. Can we still go for another journey? I just hope this will be the last, Rico. The next time you see me, don’t look back. Just turn around. Don’t ever look back. And that’s what I’m also going to do. This doesn’t have to end in anger. This time, please leave me with a smile on my face. After all, we had a great time together, right? ♪ [dramatic music continues] ♪ ♪ [music fades] ♪ ♪ [OST Playing: "Pinto" by LeMon Traxx, Maro Ignacio and JY] ♪ ♪ [OST Playing: "Pinto" by LeMon Traxx, Maro Ignacio and JY] ♪ ♪ [music fades] ♪
