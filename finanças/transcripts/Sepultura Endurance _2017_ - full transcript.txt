"NOTHING IS SO PAINFUL TO THE HUMAN MIND AS A GREAT AND SUDDEN CHANGE." "NOTHING MAY ENDURE, BUT MUTABILITY!" 30th ANNIVERSARY SHOW S?O PAULO/BRASIL XAVANTES TRIBE Brazil - 1996 I'm Paulo, I'm the bass player. I'd like to thank the opportunity of doing this project. I believe is very important for our culture to show the world what we are going to do in these two days. Thank you. You gotta make it neat. Roots! Bloody roots! - Now in Castillian. - Ra?ces, sangrientas ra?ces. - Sangrientas... - Sangrientas. 2011 - SEPULTURA RECORDS THE "KAIROS" ALBUM AND GETS READY FOR ITS FIRST AMERICAN TOUR IN 5 YEARS RECORDING IN PROCESS ONLY PERSONNEL ALLOWED MUSIC PRODUCER - In the end. - Nice. It goes directly to the riff. The album starts like that... And then... Yeah, and it's gonna be awesome. And the third goes like... No... It's gonna be like... It's a great sequence. At least these three are. That's why we were talking about it in this order. It's crazy, because when I was like 11 or 12, I don't know, then was when I went to the first rock or metal concert of my life. It was a Sepultura concert, Arise tour. I saw this concert and spent my life searching for it as both as a musician and as a person. I wanted join a band, to play to many people. Being a part of it. And, after having this history, after all these years, I'm here with these guys. Can you hear it? At least playing it, it seemed amazing to me. We're here at the House of Blues in Hollywood. Jean and I are heading to the Music Institute for a workshop. Which one is the zoom button? - Isn't it the one at the top? - Oh, that's right. Go already... Turn to the right. This is something I can't seem to understand. This circus. To go on a bus like that... God. This is the Celebrity Route Map - passing by celebrities' houses... - That's true! "Robert de Niro lives here". And then they can say whatever. Because they'll never be home. Look at this house... It's weird. They don't even live there! Who is it for? It's for T?o. For the chubbier baby. - So that I can guide him. - Chubby. Family. Today it's Mother's Day back in Brazil. It's all around the world, isn't it? Mother's Day. Mother's Day! Where was this picture taken? Today it's going to be our 11th concert with no day off. We got snow in Canada, and an intense heat in Florida. Now it's a scorcher out here. It's 11 pm now and it's around 28?C, but it really fells like 35?C since it's damp. Well, let's try to do one more concert. There will be 3 more in Texas and we'll have a day off in the middle of nowhere. But let's do it. Not showering, not sleeping, but making it worth it. It's awesome in here. It's tough. The worst is we're not even halfway through. I play everyday for many people. I play with Sepultura, etc. But, on the other hand I'm away from my family. In 2010 we spent five months in Europe. It's surreal. And it's crazy, you lose touch with... You come back home and you're a stranger. It takes some time to reconnect to people. It feels strange. To get back on track. It's like growing something you believe in. There's no other way to go. Otherwise, you become a puppet. In the end, you gotta do something you believe in. If you don't believe it anymore... I'm not going to make you believe again. We have this amazing album in our hands. You're getting your name out there. You know your name is getting bigger and bigger. Among the sponsors and among people who see you playing and say: "I haven't seen this dude before. Where was I?" You're creating something that you being on Sepultura now or, in the future, not anymore, you'll make opportunities to go wherever you want. There's not one concert where you look at me - and I'm not on fire. - No doubt. There's not a single one! -So, I just wanted you to know, -I know. -that what I'm living now, -I get it. Being away from my family is driving me crazy, way more than... Money? Sure! You go crazy with it. You have to pay bills, your own stuff, clearly. I am a father and I have to provide for them all. - But, man... - Jean... This "being away" thing... Philosophically speaking, you'll only be a father for them if you are here. Living in the present. You see? It's not a matter of being there, your thoughts being there. You are here. It's no use. Take my daughter Giulia's party as an example, if I'd thought like: "Man, I could have done x and y". I'd have crumbled and fallen apart. You can go there. But I call her and we talk. I say I'm here working hard. I hang up, I look outside the window and I'm in Houston, in Texas. I look for a Caf? Brasil to eat and buy silly stuff? I can't keep thinking about the party. My hair is going grey, when not falling off? You start developing problems. You stop living and start falling apart. You spend some time in Brazil, with a friend, doing whatever. And that's it. That's it. And you weren't here. The same happened to Igor. Exactly the same thing. He started to fall apart. His body was here, but when he spoke, you could feel him leaving. He went to Brazil in his mind and stayed there. He was neither here or there. There he fought a lot, and back here he was playing badly. That's not your case. But in the end, you know? He wasn't here not even during the concerts. Well... I don't know, man... It's a matter of acknowledging who you are. I am trying to help. I know it's tough. And then you tell me... I started my family around the same time of "Roots". We were killing it. I bought myself a Harley Davidson, built a pool in my house. Then you leave and you got 2 kids at home, Yohan had just been born. And we got on a rhythm we had never been before. And now we're back to it. I'd love to have... Slayer doesn't have what Metallica has, that is performing whenever they like. Megadeth can't pull that off. Anthrax neither. - Nobody can. - Well, U2 can. Oh well... That's another situation. It's almost an unattainable thing. But that's it. You should live in the present? Because this present will strengthen your bonds. Your family will see you're here, body and soul, doing whatever it takes to provide for them. You are a musician. Period. Even if you want to do something else, you will never be as good at it as you are as a drummer. Anyway, man, I know it's a struggle. It's hard, but... In the end, you look over your shoulder and you see... This experience is incredibly enriching. You'd regret it for the rest of your life. - No, man. - It's not that. It's not, these are options. In the future you'll think "Damn". The thing is: making a decision with much going on. No, I am not. That's what I'm... It's obvious you'll run to the safer side. I brought this up exactly because of this. I needed... Who else could I talk about it? Just you guys. You are around. I spend with you almost the same time I spend with Nanda. Well, these are the two families we have. - Sure. - We might not call it as such, but it is. - We can't deny it. - It could be much worse. - Obviously it could. - Our bond here is really good. As a group, as a band. It could be a living hell. The driver could be an ass. Anyway, the glass is always half empty and half full. I think you should... well... My point of view is always slightly more positive. Yohan loves rock, he wants to be a musician too. There's this influence. It's all about the example set. It's all about what they see and feel, it's more than anything I might say. But it's tough, there isn't one day that... talking to Patricia isn't hard. It's really hard. This is the balance I've been seeking. That's the point. In fact, that's the hardest thing. Nothing good and... worth it comes easily. There's no such thing. Are you filming all of this? ROCK IN RIO 2011 REHEARSE Jean stuck with us. Recorded two albums. It was a good time, really positive then he left after Rock in Rio 2011, after that amazing concert where we played with "Les Tambours du Bronx". AUDITION Instead of the guitar doing it... Without the bass drum. It doesn't have to be hard. Then it goes, like eight times. Then the guitar comes in. - Alright. - The guitar comes in and we both stop. - Then it's like in the album. - I got it. It's intimidating, when you play and adrenalin pumps, time goes faster. I don't remember lots of the things I went through. When you play in a band you appreciate the style, when you're already a fan it's priceless. This is what I've always wanted, and I've always searched for. Well, I think it was great. You also felt good, even though I couldn't hear anything. - It's an honor being here. - Come on. Thank you. I've listened to you guys for a long time now. Sometimes you stop and look back to all the history. Sometimes, you go like: "Man, I'm still here, doing this, after all these years." You have some flashbacks, like d?j? vu, and you say: I guess I've been here before. But, I think this is a part? I guess every human being is like that. When people ask: "Do you regret leaving Sepultura?" No. Not to have left it. I do regret, tough not having lived with the guys now that they're mature. They were really childish. Back then, we were spotting people in our own city that liked it. It was a sort of movement that grew but we didn't know each other. Then, I went to this bar, which was in Savassi because of this song that was playing. I met Max and Igor there. And I said: "I heard you guys have a room, and that you'll play there that there is music and there's this band. And I'd like to see it". And they said "Do you also play?" I said: "Sure". Then there was a rehearse at Paulo's house. Then I went to see them playing and I got horrified. It was really bad. I guess that was the worst thing I had ever heard in my life that you could actually call a band. It was incredibly bad, really. I couldn't understand a thing. They just made noise. Wagner, who later went to Sarc?fago, screamed a lot. Then I said: "What is it? It has nothing to do with the song I'm listening to. I want to play metal, but this kind of song is weird." Then, I started to play and to show some things that later became "Necromancer" and "Troops of Doom". Then, Max said: "Is it yours?" "Yes, it's mine." "That's nice." "Do you want to join the band?" Yes, I do. But only if we could make some changes. He said: "What kind of changes?" "The first thing is this lead singer. I won't play with him, he was screaming, he seemed to be about to throw up and he was throwing bananas at everybody. Banana peels, blackberries to stain the audience clothes. That's not it. Let's play, rehearse, practice on a specific time. Then I am in". "That's fine. He's out." Then, Max, Igor, Paulo and I started the project. I have no doubt in my mind that I helped very much with the consistency of the band in the very beginning to say: "Let's stop and have a plan." I didn't know the first thing, about market, I didn't imagined going to S?o Paulo, it was the absolute main goal. "Man, one day we'll play in S?o Paulo." A bunch of kids with nothing to do, but everyone loved rock. Let's hang out together, let's get some adventure. There weren't any shows, so let's start to organize them. We did start to organize shows. It was fun. It was something fun that somehow managed to move forward there was more and more synergy, it started to take off. I believe we opened our eyes for the things around us. Max was the highlight, when it came to market affairs. Their mother gave them money so they could go to school, Sometimes they walked to it, sometimes they didn't even show up, and used that money to send terrible recordings to other countries. To the United States, to Europe? And they sent those pitiful recordings. Then I saw a Fanzine and they were in the first place. Everything was done through letters, basically smoke signals. We have to remember that we're talking about a time where Internet and cellphones, didn't exist, so everything was dealt through letters. When I left Sepultura, I left without thinking about money. Without thinking like "It may work, and I can get some money from it." I didn't think like that. I still remember walking down the street and tell Jairo: "Don't go, you will regret it terribly. Don't leave the band." He said: "I want to do something else." Then Andreas came along, in the middle of all this talking because of his band, that we watched play in Santo Andr?. I don't remember if its name was Esfinge, Then Andreas came and I taught him the songs, And I said: "That's it." I want to invite again to the stage our brother, the original guitarist of this band. Jairo Tormento! Meeting the guys from Sepultura motivated me a lot, because they wanted so badly that things worked out. They really wanted it, they only thought about it. I was looking forward to going to Belo Horizonte to talk to them, because that was what I really wanted. Then, I moved to Belo Horizonte, I stayed at Max and Vania's. Everybody who loved metal stayed there. Vania was the metal mother, everybody called her "mother". It was very common, because she was truly supportive, she let us sleep in the living room, in the rooms. All of those stinky metalheads, sleeping on top of each other, and I was there and got astounded by looking at them. It was way cooler than S?o Paulo. It was better, crazier and authentic. I was really authentic. I guess the family was the Kickstarter. It was essential to allow Sepultura to be possible. If Sepultura took off, it was surely because of Paulo, his family's help that let us practice in their house. Because my mother didn't like me to listen to those songs in my house. Picture it: every weekend a bunch of boys not only from the band, but also the ones that were always there in the practices. Because, it's hard to put on a show today. Can you imagine how it was back in 1985? There weren't any shows. The shows were the practices. Paulo lived up a hill, it was a really shitty place. And we practiced there, was where I saw Sepultura playing for the first time. I got perplexed. How could they play like that in a place like this? Because they played using those tiny Gianninis, Max hooked his microphone onto the door, Igor had a broom stick holding his cymbals. It was poor, but they had this chemistry, and they sounded good. It was there that I practiced with them for the first time. There's a Sepultura before Andreas and after Andreas. It was already great, but Andreas was that touch the band needed in order to go to the next level. Andreas structured the band, musically speaking. I guess it was a... This duo, Andreas and Max, was powerful, because Max, the song goes in his head, you can see it so, he knows the voice he has to make, he starts planning his voice... His voice was there even before the base was there. When he showed it to Andreas, he built it and transformed into power. We quit this... This death metal thing like "Bestial" and "Morbid Visions" and we started to make more technical stuff just like "Kreator", "Destruction", "Slayer". I made this riff in that first practice. And we developed "From The Past Comes The Storms". That opened "Schizophrenia", my first work with the band. - Yes? - Paulinho Xisto? Come in. Well, there was a terrible gate here. Here, there was a doorbell to which Paulo answered all moody. There was this little gate that had a graffiti: "Sepultura: Black Metal BH", or something. There was a counter, but there was a hill and Paulo's house was uphill. And we practiced here. The house was way back there. It was there. It was a shitty house with two rooms, I guess... My house was here, exactly here. And there was an old house here. I guess there was an avocado tree here and the house was back there. - Down there. - A little down there. Damn... It's not going to rain. If the clouds come from there, it rains. Everything is white. It won't happen. Chardonnay, by Sepultura. That's fancy. Very fancy. If I'm not mistaken, the new Cogumelo store is here, in the mall. - Really? That close? - I guess so. I am almost sure. We stayed on the sidewalk. It was crowded. Only metalheads. After 5pm, after school, after work it was pumped? On Saturday. We stayed there listening to music, we didn't buy anything, or do, but we were there. The guys from Sepultura, Overdose, Holocausto, Mutilator, - Chakal. - Chakal. Sarc?fago. Sepultura had made a show in S?o Paulo and another one in Rio de Janeiro. Before I came in. They'd also made some here in Belo Horizonte. Around 7 shows a year. My first show was in Caruaru. I joined the band in April... May, I'm not sure. And we played one month later. I joined the band there. Exactly. There. Cogumelo is there. Yes, but when I was coming back with Max we were talking and it was there where I joined it. Next to that payphone. This professionalization of heavy metal was started in Belo Horizonte. Things like the production of covers, drawings, photos? We owe it to Jo?o Eduardo and Patty from Cogumelo. They did a great work to metal. This period between late 80s and early 90s, they ran things here in Brazil. They and Valcir's Woodstock Discos. You could see them by far, the long-haired guys around here, wearing black, talking about music. And Cogumelo was here. Today it's this homeopathic venue. - I guess Cogumelo comprised both. - Both? Or one of them. - I think it was here. - Yeah, I think so too. There was music playing inside, some counters with vinyl records. The crowd stayed here. I remember that we named our album "Schizophrenia" here. We had this list with 5 or 6 names. So Max got in and told Jorge: "We have a name!" and the rest is history. Cogumelo was the one which started to really invest on it. Cogumelo release this Sepultura and Overdose split LP, in only one record. Recorded "Bestial", "Morbid Visions" and "Schizophrenia". It was the three of them. Going to S?o Paulo was the same as having an international career. Rio de Janeiro too. This was having an international career. This was back then. - Where is it? - Cogumelo's here. The restaurant is there. - Excuse me. - Look who's behind the counter. How are you doing? COGUMELO RECORDS' OWNER -Do you remember me? I thought he wouldn't remember. That's what there is left of Paulo. - Hello, Jo?o. - It's really nice to see you here. Such a great surprise. - That's right! - That's right. Look, "Schizophrenia" cover over there. Is this the original one? It was made by Patty's brother, wasn't it? Was it made by Ives? This is the original one. From this one? They took a picture and transformed it. The photolith was made from this. When they first showed up and started to hang around here, since the beginning we chose them. We always invested very much on them. We made them play in every capital city. We did something we'd never done before with anyone else. We said: "You're playing in S?o Paulo" or "You're playing in Rio de Janeiro," I demanded much of them, I took them to bus stations. I had to talk to their parents, because they were underage. So they could go to S?o Paulo. You must remember that. - My dad had to allow. - He sure did. And he had to take us to the station, otherwise, we couldn't go. Now, "Schizophrenia" was Andreas first work, and I think the band improved a little, quit the death metal thing, and brought the trash metal. My opinion is that one of the greatest? The greatest change, maybe it was this... Both, this technical and production improvement. Yes, I even said that the production of "Schizophrenia" was flawless. - It sure was. - We chose the letter font, the double cover, the picture... The money we invested... The label, right? Ever single detail. And from "Schizophrenia", we noticed that it was... They went abroad to play, they got a manager, and everything. Now, if you ask: Did you expect it? - No, we didn't. - Sure, nobody imagined it. Borivoj, was key to the beginning of Sepultura's career. He posted Sepultura on his Fanzine's cover in New York. I don't even remember the name. And there were rumors about it. But "Schizophrenia" was the responsible for putting us on the map. It was even pirated in Europe. We didn't get any money, but we got acknowledgment. JOURNALIST MUSIC CRITIC With the success of "Schizophrenia" we signed with RoadRunner. Borivoj came to Brazil in order to see the band, to get to know it. He stayed in Belo Horizonte, he watched some shows and when he went back to the US he said: "Yes, that's it. Let's sign them." He wasn't from the company, but he spoke to Monte Conner who represented RoadRunner and said: "These guys are good, let's give them a chance." We are going to play a song from "Beneath the Remains". Our first album to be internationally released, our first video clip and this song is called "Inner Self". We spent two months in Europe. After that, we spent more two months in the United States. There, we met Gloria, who was a manager for Sacred Reich. And there, she loved the band. She said she would talk to Cees Wessels, who owns RoadRunner and that she wanted to manage for us as well. And things truly took off very fast. Because she was really working for the band. There still wasn't that closer relationship she had with Max. Which was what really got in the way of everything we were accomplishing. With Arise, We could go to the United States. And we could spend some time, recording at Morrisound studios, where we'd always dreamt of recording along with Scott Burns. To have all the condition to make the album we dreamt about, that we really wanted to make. Max, try to sing differently, so we can compare the voices. Maybe deeper. I don't know. "Arise" was one of the best tours we've ever gone on. Sepultura was really put on the map. This worldwide boom? There are people that still don't get, still don't understand. I guess due to prejudice, and due to lack of information. So, when they boomed abroad, despite of booming abroad, there wasn't acknowledgment of that, say, media that loves pop or any immediate success there might be. And I still see it today. Being away from Brazil, we could perceive it as a unique country that owned unique stuff and that we could use it in a natural manner, since we are Brazilians. Then, little by little, we brought it to our songs. Even on Territory's opening there's this Brazilian groove. "Kaiowas" too, had influences of the Brazilian country music, of ten-stringed guitars, of the beat from northeast Brazil that goes? That also had a great deal of influence on us. We were focusing more on Brazil than on other countries. In "Arise" it was different. We focused on them and as for Brazil, everything sounded like trash to us. On the recording of "Chaos AD", we took some percussion instruments such as tambourine, Brazilian pandeiro surdo drum, g?iro, triangle. Quite typical of the Brazilian percussion. I won't say a word. Such a great lead singer. Putting on some drama... I'll take a picture. Man, you are ugly. Jesus Christ! Is that the advertising? Can you get me four more pairs of drum sticks, please? We were evolving not only musically but also in the themes. We wanted to show a more realistic Brazil. This "big city" thing in S?o Paulo. The corruption in politics, the police brutality, etc. Expose this huge metropolis. Therefore, we inserted it to the lyrics. "Let's compose something", "Ok", but nobody had any ideas, not even a riff. Then we started to try, one guy playing here, another there, this huge mess, and nothing came up. Then Max and I were trying together with our guitars. We said: "Today it's impossible." And we thought "Let's bail". When we had almost left, he went like... Very explosive, quitting. Then I said: "That's nice. Do it again." He kind of didn't know how to, then I got my guitar and? Then we managed to do it from there. Igor got the sticks and we played it like? Then it happened. We made an opening in order to give it a Brazilian touch. "Chaos A.D." was released, and it was the album of the year. It was released in the United States by Sony Music, and it got a golden record. It was also awarded Golden record in other countries. My God, man. It worked! We played at the "Castle Donington", many great festivals around the world going on spectacular tours. "Chaos A.D." introduced to metal a whole new characteristic. The catch of Sepultura was this chemistry. The way Igor played it, such a spectacular and brutal drummer. This thing about Paulo being quieter. This chemistry was the responsible for Sepultura to be so special. But specially Max and I. Not only when it came to make riffs. Things started with the guitar, but because we talked a lot. Let's visit the Xavantes tribe, let's do something on the Moon, let's record something underwater, unimaginable things... "But, let's! Let's do it!" "Imagine if we played there...?" "If we played we Sabbath..." These boy's dreams, you know? It was really strong between us. And I feel Gloria got in the way. She diverted his attention from it, and she created this thing like: "No, he'll do it himself", "He'll be responsible for that..." Then, we went on different buses, we had different dressing rooms. Then it started. This thing like: "You are the lead singer, you are in charge of the lyrics, you give interviews." "Roots" was such a harsh record to make. Ross helped a lot, on the process of understanding what was going on in and out of the band. Between "Chaos A.D." and "Roots", we started to use a lower tuning. And the riff in "Roots" came around. As I said, Max brought the chorus. He brought it, which was practically the entire chorus of the song. "Roots, bloody roots!", etc. Then, we created this song from this riff. I suggested we opened with... Which is what we call a single string instead of a chord, just to make it more dynamic this interaction between verse and chord. Then, the song started, and it evolved like that. This tuning gives these chords another emphasis. It gives you more structure. "Roots" is a fantastic project because it was made by a team and it didn't get the right promotion of how it was conceived by the band. Gloria failed to do so, to show how the project had been conducted. Everything that happened after was a consequence of that. While "Roots" was killing it, selling like crazy... Creating this new revolution. We were shattered as a band, there wasn't that unity anymore. Max traveled alone, on a different bus. The "best buds" thing had faded. He took Gloria's family on tour. Then, in the end of the first year of "Roots" tour in 1996, we had this huge disagreement. The last show on Europe was at the Brixton Academy, on December 16th 1996. And it was the end of the agreement and we decided to fire Gloria. Since she wasn't willing to change the management scheme, because we were away from everything. And we wanted someone else that could represent us. Because she didn't represent it, she represented Max. And nothing more. She wanted to have Max and a backup band. Gloria already had plans to remove Max from the band, so much so that he left the band, he turned his back and left. He didn't fight for the name, nor for anything else belonging to Sepultura. He signed all the papers, everything is duly registered and he went away. Everyone was burned out. We had been traveling for 5 years straight. We didn't stop. Tour. Practice. Record. Take the road. Tour, tour and more tour. Everybody was burned out for we were traveling and working so much. Today, I'd say: "Are you on a crisis? Let's have a year off, let's spend some money, let's stay with our family, enjoy ourselves. We get back in a year. We had lost everything. We lost the lead singer, the manager, the record label. All the structure Sepultura had, the fans from abroad, left with Max. Everything spins in your head, that the band can have an end? At first, we even thought of changing the band's name. We started to restructure. We looked for another manager, Todd Singerman. MOTORHEAD'S MANAGER FORMER SEPULTURA'S MANAGER We spent almost a year, I guess. Around nine months. And we started things over only the three of us. Andreas giving us options of vocal until we realized we needed another person so that we could fill this hole. There was this piece missing, and it was quite important, it had just happened. Then it took? little by little we got back on track, we regained that trust... And when we played together again we realized we would need another person completely different than Max but capable enough to be our lead singer. Derrick was the one who shed light over a new path for Sepultura. We didn't want anyone like Max. In the ads for "Against", there weren't any pictures. They didn't like Derrick, they said he wasn't the lead singer. He was rejected by the label and by everyone who was there. In fact, everyone wanted it to follow the former standard. They expected another Max. We had to put our foot down. At the end of the day, we know what is going on. They don't. They have another viewpoint? We're here, we're playing... We knew the potential, and where we could go. And it's not one, or two or three people that will? know about it. What we felt is that there was something special about him. So, we had to fight for it. The more I listen to it, more I like it, and the more I relate to each song and it's really nice. And this album brings it very much. Each song has its own power. It was really important that Igor stayed, there are no doubts about it. It was a trio, and show that... Max had left, but we are here, together. We were in that together. He was a fighter, really, for keeping that up... We did "Against", "Nation", "Roorback", "Revolusongs" albums that were important for our history, That kept us United. And after 10 years Max had left in 1996, in 2006, Igor, after "Danter XXI" that he recorded he couldn't take anymore. I guess he couldn't take his life with his wife anymore, with the band. He had to make a change and leave the band. I remember that he came to me one day before the trip, and said: "I don't want to and I won't travel." I got surprised, but I knew it would happen. Because it came gradually, we were ready for the impact. Then we found ourselves on this limbo again. Until we found Jean Dolabella, who had joined the band and really gave us this new breath. Jean stuck with us, recorded two albums. It was a great time, really positive. But he didn't manage to enjoy that "being on the road" thing. When I joined it, I was 20. Then you see guys like Jean, Igor... Man, they were gods as drummers. Replacing them was an enormous responsibility. I told Andreas: "We have to go and you'll see, we'll stay in all day. We won't have much time, but it'll work out. It'll work out, and it'll be amazing. As it has always been." Only with Ross, we made "Roots" together. Such a great album, one of the most special there is. Now, we have the opportunity to work together again. And both sides are... Really... Excited about this opportunity. This pan sticks, but it will work out. It kind of cures the food. It's really good, this pan. You add some tomato... Tomato gives it some... I'll add it last so it can get juicier. I tried to add some ideas. I think it's important to bring something different. To add some of yourself to it. I guess this is part of a musicians' job too. We're heading to the end of this show... And we wanted to play something that is really special that we composed specially for you guys, Sepultura fans. We wouldn't have been here for the last 30 years if it hadn't been for you. Making this mind-blowing show! Thank you! For the ones who have Sepultura under your skin? This song was specially made for you. "Sepultura Under My Skin". Sepultura from Brasil! One, two, three, four! Everybody said that I changed the band when I joined it... But everybody who joined it changed it. And that's how it has to be. We've always respected a new characteristic. Even when it was that other formation, Let's make "Roots", let's make "Kaiwoas". Acoustic songs and everything... We've never been afraid to do so. And up to now, that's what makes this band alive and kicking. This lack of fear of doing stuff. Thank you very much! MAX AND IGGOR CAVALERA REFUSED TO TAKE PART ON THIS FILM
