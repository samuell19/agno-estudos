♪ Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go ♪ Okay, Roy McCormick fan or not, you gotta admit, the guy is a Cinderella story. He grows up without two nickels to rub together, and look at him now. He's led Ohio Polytech to three championships. He is one of the best coaches in college basketball.

His team has a lot of work to do, and not much time to do it. It is crunch time. This is where we're gonna find out what these two teams and their coaches are really made of. -(whistle blowing) -What are you callin'? What are you callin', Earl? Earl, what is that? What is that? Keep it up, Roy. Just one more word. Hey, Coach, this is my nest! This is my nest! You need to do an endorsement for Altoids. Your breath is humming! Hey, clown. You keep runnin' your mouth, I'm gonna come over there and rearrange your beak. What? You talkin' smack? You talkin' smack, huh? You talkin' smack? Shut up. (whistle blowing) -No basket. -What? Why don't we play jacks? 'Cause we're not playin' basketball. -(whistle blowing) -Technical foul, Coach Roy. I... I was way over there! That's two. You're out of here! -Just because-- Did I do this? -Don't touch my whistle. Did I do that? Did I do that? -That's why you give me a tech! -REFEREE: Hit the showers. No, you hit the showers, Earl! You hit the showers! I'm not hittin' no showers! (laughing) Yeah! Kick him out! Kick him out! Y'all didn't even ask me what went on. Y'all just snatched me. You know what? -(crowd gasping) -Victor? Coach Roy killed Victor! -(booing, shouting) -You're crazy! Victor? Victor? (making bird noises) I feel bad. I feel real bad. (sighs) You know, out there havin' temper tantrums and arguin' with the refs. Man, I should know better than that. You represent everything that's wrong with college sports today. You don't care about the players. You don't care about the game. If things don't go your way, you explode like a spoiled child. Look, if you're gonna fine me, fine me, man. How much? A'ight. 'Cause I ain't got all day. It's time for me to bounce. What's happenin'? It is with such pleasure that I say that you, Roy McCormick, that you're officially banned from coaching in the N.C.B.A. for the remainder of your life. You bannin' me, huh? Yeah. Okay. I been here longer than all y'all. You forgot about the three championships I won, didn't you, Mr. Vice President? Huh? And now you wanna ban me? No, I'm bannin' you. I'm bannin' you for life. -Can he ban us? -Of course not! Stand up straight. Excuse me, gentlemen. "Prior to a lifetime ban, "offending coach must be granted an opportunity to demonstrate compliance. "If offending coach completes the remainder of the season without any infractions-- "ejections, criminal malfeasance, etcetera-- he must be readmitted on a probationary basis." In short, you gotta give Roy one last chance to prove himself. Yes, but it doesn't say I have to let him coach out the rest of the year in my league. Watch your temper, Roy. Good luck finding another team. We should go. ♪♪ (guitar) And then, I'm gonna smash the guitar. Good, 'cause if you don't, I will. Dad call? He comin' to this game? (sighs) Keep practicin', okay? Come on. We're late. Hey, hold it. Hold it. Okay, look. I would love to tell you that everybody you meet in this life was gonna be great, and you could always count on those people. That'd be a lie. Your dad's not a part of our lives anymore, all right? But I got your back, and I'm gonna keep havin' your back. So before you go givin' up on this world, you need to wait till you're about 18 like everybody else, all right? Mom, if you're so smart, how'd you end up with Dad in the first place? Okay, you know what? You're too smart for your own good. -I'll see you at the tip-off. -All right, Mom. Oh, because if I hadn't, I-- I wouldn't have had you. Keith? I wouldn't have had you. I always think of the good mom stuff after he's gone. Crazy. (grunts) -(shouts) -(laughter) It's game day here at Mount Vernon. Let's take a moment to review the Smelters' starting lineup. First off, we have Keith Ellis. Now, everyone knows Keith Ellis is the best player on the team, including Keith. GIRL #1: And at power forward is One Love. GIRL #2: Okay, now, the only thing One Love loves more than playing basketball is his shoes, um, his hair, his image, and his shoes again. GIRL #1: At point guard, we've got Ralph. GIRL #2: The kid has got four older brothers, okay? All of them were all-star athletes. I mean, the pressure to succeed is tremendous. (vomiting) Returning as small forward is the player with the best attitude and the worst vision. Last year, he held the record for the most balls to the face. GIRL #1: Luckily, this year, he has a solution. GIRL #2: And a new nickname, Annie. Everyone's callin' the kid Goggles. Rounding out the starting five is Fuzzy. Now, we have high expectations for the kid. I mean, word on the street is that he's been bulking up specifically for this season. ANNIE: And, of course, the coach of our intrepid team and home ec teacher, Mr. Newirth. While he's never coached before or even played the game of basketball, he proved to the administration he was exactly what they were looking for. Oh, yeah? How? -He volunteered for the job. -Okay. Get a shoe contract yet, One Love? -Not yet. -Bam! (whistle blowing) Your deal. Court's free. You little guys wanna warm up? What for? Want a cookie? -You spit on this? -No. -All right. -GIRL: Game nine, and the pressure is on. But you couldn't tell by looking at the calm, confident faces of the Smelters, easily the best 0-8 team in the league, hungry to avenge their nail-biting loss last week. 86 to zero. In which the Smelters were subjected to several hundred bad calls. ALL: Break! (laughter) Okay. ONE LOVE: One Love's cutting! One Love's open! One Love is open! One Love has the ball! (glass shattering) Here! Pass it! Right here, Keith! Right here! Keith! (buzzer sounds) -FUZZY: Man, what's he doing? -ONE LOVE: I don't know. KEITH: Man, if we had Coach Roy, we'd never lose. (bell ringing) ♪♪ (theme on TV) -Touchdown! -Oh, here's the-- Ow! -(audience cheering) -All right, our next guest is looking to get back into the game he loves, and this time, he promises -not to ruffle any more feathers. -ARNOLD: Aw! Please welcome the former head coach at Ohio Polytech, -Roy McCormick! -(audience cheering) -Hey! -How are ya? Roy, you're a man of your word. You always said you'd come on the show when you were available. And, brother, you are really available now. Well, you know, I'm weighin' my options. I'm a free agent, baby. -(applause) -My fans! Word on the street is you couldn't get a job right now fielding sheep. -Whoa! -(audience gasping) Look, I wanna go somewhere where... where the desire to win is just great, you know. 'Cause y'all know I'm a winner, and I... I kind of wanna go back to my roots. That's what I want. ARNOLD: You're a winner! He's a winner, folks! -COACH ROY: That's right. -Come with me. Come on. I got a plan. Come on. (ringing) -Anything yet? -It's ringing. -There? -Mm-hmm. -I'll get it. Stay. -Whatever. COACH ROY: Man, this is a junior high. I won three N.C.B.A. championships. I mean, what do I gotta do? Roy, don't you see it? It's perfect. It's your old school. Look, we accept their offer. You work with these kids for a week. They get a huge thrill out of it. Duh! You look like a saint, and we get free P.R., which, no offense, Roy, we desperately need. In the meantime, it'll give me a chance to land us a solid job offer. -What offers do we have now? -Hmm? Doreen, this is the supplemental budget. Could you get me the full budget, please? Hon, that is the full budget. (sighs) Tim Fink, principal partner, the Fink Agency. "Fink fast!" Yeah. Mary Walsh, principal, Mount Vernon Junior H-- Whoo! Whoa! Wow! Okay, it's Coach Roy. Coach Roy is in the house. (whispering) Coach Roy is here. It's my house. All right. Well, then, gentlemen... Uh-oh! Community service? Did you get arrested for something? We get more great sports guys that way. We're here to accept your offer. Yay! No idea what you're talking about. Your offer. Mm-hmm. Oh, my. Oh, my goodness. I... Just... S-Spelling error. So you're telling me that Roy McCormick wants to coach here? Am I gettin' Punk'd? Roy's gonna work with your team. They're gonna be coached by the best of the best for absolutely wait for it... no charge. COACH ROY: Yeah, I wanna give back to the community. You know, here's where I found my first true love, which is basketball. Well, teamwork. So I guess that's two loves. -Two loves. -Mm-hmm. That was very inspiring, Coach. Well, uh, gosh, gentlemen. I guess... Follow me? PRINCIPAL WALSH: People. Apparently, some of you have tried to circumvent school policy and hire a new head coach on your own. Well, I'm impressed. Without further ado, please welcome your new head coach. Wow. They're really short. Yeah, they're 13. All right, well, good luck, kids. And, uh, behave yourself. KEITH: Oh, we will. I was talking to him. Coach Roy, I'm a big fan. I've seen all your commercials. A couple things I should warn you about. Ralph here, for instance, when he gets nervous, he pukes. -You my assistant head coach? -Real honor working with you. Yeah, I appreciate it. Well, uh, why don't you run and fetch me a patty melt? Maybe one with your arms around the kids having fun? Yeah, sure thing. Huh? Got it? That's right. Y'all look basketball style. -We're never gonna lose again. -Yeah. One Love's definitely on the way to getting a shoe contract now. -Yeah! -How you feeling, Ralph? -(vomiting) -Oh! ♪ What's up, Doc can we rock ♪ -Oh! Priceless. -♪ What's up, Doc can we rock ♪ Y'all run some drills. All right? I'm gonna try to get this guck off my shoe. Excuse me, Mr. Photographer. -We don't know any drills. -Or have any skills. We'll just have to make some up then. Come on. ♪♪ (whistling "Sweet Georgia Brown") Okay, great drill. Let's run our passing drill now. Come on. (chattering) Let's step it up. ONE LOVE: I got it. I got it. -(laughing) -(groaning) -(groans) -Yeah! -Ooh! -Aah! -(sighs) -Mary, is it really a good idea? You know, Jeanie, you may find this hard to believe, but I don't get a lot of gifts here at Mount Vernon. I got no money. I got no resources. I got no nothin'. Excuse me. That's a double negative. Bethanne, stick it where the sun don't not shine. So, when one of the best coaches in basketball wants to coach my kids for free, kids who, incidentally, are on their way to another no-win season, I'm not gonna say no. Besides, Coach Roy has never hit a player. Oh, okay. Great, great. So that's the criteria? If he's never hit a kid, then he can work at Mount Vernon. Yeah, I know. But check it out. If he steps out of line in any way, all we have to do is call the N.C.B.A., and he's out of here. So I think he's gonna be on his best behavior. Okay, how are you gonna run a school and monitor a madman? Well, Jeanie, I'm not. Uh-uh! No, no, no, no, no! I'm not either. -Uh, uh, uh... -Yes, yes, yes, yes. You go to all the games anyway. You could be my eyes and ears. Yeah. The minute you say he's out of line, he's gone. Come on. Girls, trust me. Coach Roy is going to do wonders for this school. -Coach Roy has some issues... -Uh! -that he needs to work... -Uh! A little bit... out. -(chattering) -Stop. Stop. Stop. (all gasping) ALL: Dang! GOGGLES: You really bleed a lot. High blood pressure. -Too much stress. -What's that? CK-One? How much do they pay you to put that on your hankie? Let me smell it. Look, I don't care how many titles he's won. I don't care anything about that. I know his reputation. -Come on. Give him a chance. -For what? He's got some problems, and if he touches my son... Stay away from my son! KEITH: Mom, he didn't hit anybody. Yet. He just got here. Give him a chance. We hit him and barfed on him. Plus, his Escalade got tagged. -(groans) -But he doesn't know that yet. Look, I'm sorry. My name is Jeanie, and it's just my son means a lot to me. Look, uh... Excuse me. Miss Jeanie? Now, look, I know my reputation precedes me. But it's just rep, you know? It's not true. Roy McCormick. Very nice to meet you. I know who you are. My son idolizes you. Well, your son, he... he's a good kid. I think he's gonna do big things in this game. He's gonna be all right. Well, that's good to know, because that's not my son. That's my son. He's gonna be good too, 'cause they-they run drills together, so... They kind of know the same drills. And, quite frankly, I don't like the way you treat your players. My son doesn't need some hotshot egomaniac trying to tell him he's good, because he is good. Ma'am... Miss Jeanie, look, I swear, the only reason I'm here is-is to help these kids. I wouldn't do anything to hurt 'em. Now, that temper tantrum thing is long gone. Well, it was nice meeting you. Very nice meetin' you. If you don't mind, maybe I can call you sometime or somethin'? I don't think so. Dude, Roy's checking out your mom. He ain't lyin'. Coach Roy, what's it like coming back to coach at your old school? It's a'ight, you know, and, you know... I grew up in the mean streets... the suburbs. Okay? I had one dream, and that was to get out, not end up here like these losers... who, I guess, I would love to give back to, you know? For such a great coach, he really doesn't do much, does he? No. (door opens) -There's a game today? -That's why we're in uniform. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. You don't remember me, do you? I applied to be your assistant coach seven times. You said that I was too rigid. Turns out I wasn't so rigid, I couldn't lead the Vikings to nine state championships. Wow. I didn't know middle schools had state championships. Yeah, well, they do, and I won them nine times. Nine times? Big kudos for ya. F.Y.I. The only kid you need to look out for on my team is my son, Larry Jr. All right, well, good luck, man. You're in my house! This is my world! You be in my world now! -No mercy. -(whistle blowing) -One, two, three. -ALL: No mercy! Let's get some! (whistle blowing) Oh! Way downtown! Yeah! One Love is cutting! One Love is open! One Love has the ball! One Love is shaking! One Love is baking! Aah! My shoe! Aren't you supposed to be doing something? Yeah, I'm thinking about what I'm gonna eat for lunch. You interested? -Keith, I'm open! -ONE LOVE: One Love is wide open! -Pass the ball! -Keith, One Love is open! Has your kid ever heard of passin'? -(groans) -(crowd booing) We had position, ref! Where's the call? -(whistle blowing) -Charge! Oh! Thank you! Are you kiddin' me? That was 10 minutes ago. Oh. (chuckles) That's our ref, "Late" Carl Freedburg. He's a good guy. He's a little slow on the whistle, though. -Keith, pass. -COACH ROY: Time out! -(whistle blowing) -Come on, guys. Huddle up. Come on. Come on. Come on. Listen, I don't mind you embarrassin' yourselves, 'cause you're used to it, okay? But now, you're startin' to embarrass me. -What's your name? -My name's Keith. Keith, do you think you can, uh, try not to turn the ball over? Guys, I need you to get out there and go to work, okay? And try to keep it in single digits. Let's go, guys. Let's go! (scoffs) We wouldn't wanna humiliate him. That's a winning attitude. (whistle blowing) -Keith, the ball! -Hey. What is he doing? (buzzer sounds) (cheering) ALL: Two! Four! Six! Eight! Who do we obliterate? Smelters! (no audible dialogue) -(audience applauding) -ARNOLD: A hockey-playing dog. What'll those Canadians think of next? Oh, speaking of animal lovers, in a follow-up to a recent story, former N.C.B.A. madman Coach Roy McCormick lost his first game today... in the cutthroat middle school division! -(laughter) -I swear to God. 109 to nothing. For real! He has to teach the kids fundamentals, things like which basket is ours. (laughter) MAN: Yeah, like jump ball means that your team has gotta jump too. Look, Roy's gotta do a better job if he wants to coach again in the N.C.B.A. -It's that simple. -(phone ringing) Oh, sh... Oh! Yeah? Roy? Fink. Uh, what the heck are you doin'? Hey, man, what's the big deal, okay? It's middle school. Who cares? Who cares? That's what I said. But, you know, Roy, it made all the national news. And I had some solid job offers lined up, and now everyone's bailed on us. Look, nobody wants to hire... a loser. Look, coach, you gotta win at least one game with these kids if you ever wanna work again. -(sighs) -(beeps) (doorbell ringing) Oh, hi. Are you Mr. McCormick? I'm a big fan. Can I please have your autograph? Sure thing, young lady. -Thank you. -(car engine starting) -Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's my car. -Here you go. That was your car. It was part of your endorsement deal, and that's been terminated. Have a great day. I still think you're great. I want my old life back. (grunts) -(grunts) -Ooh! (whistle blowing) Huddle up! Now, I'm gonna be honest with you. I can't afford to lose by triple digits again, or else I'm finished. So I've decided to teach you how to play the game of basketball. Yeah, the concept of dribbling, passing and scoring, okay? So playtime is over. And if you don't like it, the door is right there. Get back here! I'm gonna need some help. Unbelievable. -Give me that! -(both shouting) -Get off me, boy! You want some too? -♪ She's a brick house ♪ Unbelievable! -What? -She started it. -Shut up! -Go on. You're comin' with me. -Look who's in trouble again. -You got somethin' to say? Hey, look, these ain't even allowed in school. Okay? You a natural. What's your name? -Big Mac. -Big Mac. -Well, you're comin' with me, all right? -Oh, no. I'm not... No. I'm not goin' to detention. It's more like a work release program. All right? Trust me. Suit up. Come on. Come on, Big Mac. Suit up. Trust me. Whoa. Yao Ming, wait up. -What a dork. -Sorry. -Hey... -Excuse me. Can I help you? I just wanted to talk to one of your players. "Players"? These are my students. And, no, while Wes is in my class, you can't speak to him. I'll come back later, okay? Look. Wes is really shy, okay? And he's not into sports, and he really doesn't need to be pushed around by your type. -My type? -Mm-hmm. What's my type, since you know me? What's my type? A bully. A stubborn, spoiled, always-gets-his-way bully. You're good. -Thank you. -Mm-hmm. I'll come back after class. But I do gotta ask somethin'. Look, son, you like basketball? Um, I'm not very coordinated. Man, that's perfect. Nobody else on the team is coordinated. So join us, please. It's perfect. -You... out! -Just give me one second. Thirty seconds, all right? All right? Son, do you know what everybody wants out of life? -No. -They wanna be loved. I love you, because... you are six feet, man, with extremely long arms, you know? Now, I can't promise you if you join the team that you're gonna get the girls. I can't... I can help you, you know, see where they at, but I can't help you get the girls, you know. And I can't even promise that you're gonna be a good player. But what I can guarantee you is that, uh, you won't be the butt of nobody's jokes, son. -How tall are you, son? -Six-two. Six-two? I'm deeper and deeper in love! Wow! Six-two! Will you join us? I, uh... I have to wear a T-shirt under my jersey, 'cause my perspiration gives me dermatitis. Meet me at the gym at 3:00, 'cause, uh, we practice hard. I'll be there. My man. All right. -Careful. -Yeah. Thanks. -I'm watchin' you. -Yeah. Thank you. COACH ROY: These here are the new recruits. This is Wes. You mess with him, you're gonna have to answer to me. This is Big Mac. You mess with her, well, you're on your own. MAN: Are the Smelters running a drill? (knuckles cracking) Hey, I think that's the girl that stole my wife's car. Don't stare. Just out of curiosity, how long you been shootin' hoops? For a while in juvie. Well, you're our enforcer, okay? Don't mean you gotta fight. But you got five fouls. Don't be afraid to use 'em. -I don't mind fightin'. -I'm sure. But you have good hands, and you have good footwork. Use 'em. -(groans) -(thud) That's not what I'm talkin' about. -Wes! -(gasps) Yeah, Coach? Look, do yourself a favor. Don't warm up today, all right? -But I... -I know. You never, ever played basketball. But for the next 15 minutes, that's our little secret, okay? -All right. -(door opens) My secret weapon. No weapon form against thee... shall prosper. How you doin', my brother? You always come through for a brother. Hey! God bless you! -Oh, brother! -Thank you. You're shinin'. You're shinin' like the light. Look, I got about four or five other engagements I need to get to. So if we can kind of put a little pep in the step, get this thing movin'. Not a problem. Smelters! God bless you, basketball babies. How you doin'? -(muttering responses) -I'm Preacher Don. And Coach Roy asked me to come down here and speak with you. So if I... if I may, I would like to say a prayer with you and Coach Roy, if that's all right. Let's bow our heads, please. God is good. God is great. Thank you for this game we're about to receive, 'cause we about to get up in them. Thank you for the food that we about to-- No, that's the wrong prayer. God, we ask that you give us the strength, that everything will go our way out there on the court. And if that cannot happen, God, we ask that you injure some key players on the other team, not so that they get seriously injured, but that they're slowed up, so that the Smelters will win this game. Amen! Amen. Because we know you, God, loves a winner. (sniffling) Can I get an "amen"? ALL: Amen. I'm gonna need that cash real quick. -Oh, no problem. -(buzzer sounds) (knuckles cracking) -(blows whistle) -Back off! In her rookie debut, Margaret "Big Mac" Green won the Smelters' first tip-off since-- -When's the last time we won a tip? Quick. -Um-- '89. Two years before we were born. (groans) (cheering) -Wait. Uh-- -Where do we write our points? I don't know. We've never had to before. (whistle blowing) Technical foul, Mount Vernon! -What's wrong with you? -It's a technical foul. Delay of game. I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to them. Look, you can't have a parade every time you score. Now, get back out there and get your heads in the game. Let's go! Big Mac, you really tryin' my patience. Substitution. Substitution, ref. I'm bringin' in Sledgehammer. Sledge. ♪♪ ("Sledgehammer" by Peter Gabriel) You're all right. Ref, let's get an I.D. check here. This kid looks old enough to drink. Look, I'm whisperin', okay? I need you to nod your head and act like I'm sayin' somethin' important. I need you to go out here, be cool, and try not to trip. Can you do that? -I-I think so, Coach. -Thank you, son. Come on. Diamond and one. Diamond and one. Let's go. -Set it up. -MAN: Okay, double-team the kid. Double-team the Sledgehammer. Yeah! (whistle blowing) Yeah! Sledge? Hey? Give me, give me some shake and bake, baby. A double shake and bake.

What are you doin' here? -What? -Coach, what happens if we win? Fuzzy, if you win... if you win... I'll do a suicide for every point you win by, okay? Now, dig it out! Get back to work. See the way you're runnin'? That's why you're losin'. You may wanna embarrass you, but you're not gonna embarrass me! I pulled out every trick in the book today. These aren't college kids, Roy. They're 13. -(sighs) -I mean, you were 13 once, right? Only one thing motivates a 13-year-old boy, and it ain't Smelter pride. -(grunts) -(grunting, groaning) I just said something smart. -I'm gonna write that down. -(chuckles) Ladies, free pizza here. Come by the gym, get a slice. All you want. All you want. All right? (sniffing) Cheese, yeah. Cheese. Excuse me. -Is he serious? -Come on! My mouth's waterin' already. I can't wait to get to this pizza, y'all. -Hey, did you get the Cinnabon? -Whoa. 'Cause they supposed to give us a free Cinnabon that goes with these pizzas. Yeah! Pizza! Guys, layup lines. -But... -Layup lines. Come on. -All right. -Is there always gonna be pizza here? There will be from now on. -You're home ec, right? -Yeah. -How's your pizzas? -Delicious-y for shizzy. All right. Okay, good, 'cause that's your new job. -You straight? -Yes. -Oh. I will not let you down. -All right. -Okay. -All right. There's chicken parm in the crust, ladies, so put your feed bags on. Hey, green team out. Green team out. -So who are we playin'? -Me. You the ball handler, huh? Yeah, that's right. I see you. You kinda tight with that rock. You like to go to the basket. Ain't no "I" in team, huh? It's about you. Do your thing, man. Check it. -Ooh! Did I anger you? -Just give me the ball. Oh! What's the Shaq do? What's that move he do when he block people? No, Mutombo. He do like this. (imitating Mutombo) "I don't think that you should bring it in there. You should get it to one of your teammates." Let's see what you got, man. You gotta use your teammates sometime, man. Huh? Uh-oh. Look, he's mad now. Ooh! See, when I get blocked, I start looking for my teammates. You know what I mean? 'Cause they can help me out. You know? Wow! But if I get the ball to them late, watch what happens. (yells) I didn't wanna do it. ♪ I didn't wanna do it ♪ (panting) I'm hungry. What's wrong with you? Pass the ball! Dude, come on. Just pass it. We'll give it right back. Come on. Let's go. (chuckles) Wait a minute. Comin' at ya. Comin' at... (laughs) Comin' at ya. Look. All right. All right. -(groans) -All right. You passed the ball, man. How does that feel for the ball to go from your hand to another hand? Again. Try it again. Let me show you how you do the one thing. Uh-huh. Right there. Right there. Comin' at ya. Comin' at ya. (laughs) Huh? All right. All right, all right. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm gonna admit, I'm a little tired. The point I'm tryin' to prove is that teamwork beats out talent any day. Now, one on one, neither one of y'all could beat me. You know, that's just real. But all five of y'all together, if y'all play as a team, you might could do something with me. You know I mean? I'm gonna keep it real with you like that. (coughs) But anyway, I... I gotta... I gotta go throw up. Green team, you're in! Let's go, guys. One Love, hedge that ball screen. Right there. There you go. Right there. A'ight? -Go to Mac. Mac. -Here. (whistle blowing) All right. Who can tell me, again, the highly complex way of beating the pick-and-roll? Somebody? Talking? Talking. Exactly. Talking. Guys, you gotta communicate out there. You're a team. All right? Communication is the key. It's like a-a healthy relationship at home. You know? You ever flirt around with your lady? You know, your lady say... You, like, "Come on. Come on." Your lady is, like, "No, no, not right now. Remember? You said that you wanted to take some time to"... -Huh? -You know what? Run the play again and run it till you get it right. (whistle blowing) Run it! Come on, guys. Ladies, I'm not seeing none of those "R!" You know. I ain't seein' none of that. Let's go. Come on, people. Guys, communicate out there. You gotta know each other like the back of your hand. Come on! Communicate! Teamwork! -Huh? -What? I didn't say stop playin'. Communicate out there. Okay? Now you have to talk.

So what you're saying is that... I'm not really good. No, man. I'm not sayin' that. I'm sayin' the opposite of that. I'm sayin' you're so good... I wanna give you these. Yeah, these are my most prized possession. Magic Johnson gave me these. Hey, man, I won every game I wore 'em in. I... Yeah, just don't tell nobody. (chuckles) You know, folks, they get a little envious, you know, when your jump shot's like that. I promise. Well, well. If it isn't Fox Sports' turkey of the week. You're lookin' good, Roy. Larry and I are here scoutin' the Pioneers. They're our only real competition in this league. Wait. Is that a girl on your team? Girls can't play basketball. What did you... -Somebody get the ice. -What for? -(blow lands) -(Larry groans) Look, I know you don't like to back down from a fight, but real power is about bein' respected, not just crackin' heads. Think about it. -All right. -Hey. Let's go. Let's go. Do your thing. Hey. Hey. I heard what you said to Keith. I was wrong about you. -And I'm sorry. -Sorry? Sorry and "Let's go out on a date" sorry?

You know, when you first came here, I had a real bad first impression of you. Oh, but you was dead wrong, right? No. I was dead right.

Look, this, uh, personal attack on my... on my personality... Is it leading up to a kiss or, or a slap? 'Cause I can't tell yet. We'll see. I haven't decided yet. (chuckles) Yeah. Coach. -Hey. -Hey. What you doin' here? You going to the game? Hey, you know, Fuzzy's been on fire, man. Oh. Good for Fuzzy. What's a Fuzzy? It doesn't matter. Look. Do you check your messages? The N.C.B.A. review, it's today. They want to reinstate you. Today the kids got the championship. I know that. I worked it out. Look. The N.C.B.A. review's not scheduled till 4:00.

Well, he's in the N.C.B.A. review. Well, can you get him out of the meeting with the N.C.B.A.? Uh, okay. Just hang on one second. Yeah. I'm not gonna do that. He's got his career to think about. And mine. Okay? This is way more important than some kids playing in a gym with Fuzzies and Goggles. Well, can you tell him that he's a huge disappointment to me, to my son, to the Fuzzies, to the Goggles and to everybody else who thought he actually cared about something? Huge disappointment... you and son. Got it. And, uh, your name is, sweetheart? You want my name? Listen real close. (exhales) Sit down. Sit down, Roy. Sorry to keep you waiting. I just want to be the first to say about the whole banning thing... My bad. Those kids of yours are getting more press than Polytech itself. Hey, well, you know, I'm just glad we could put a few wins under our belts, you know. It just feels nice to give back to the community. Yeah, right. Uh, you know, you got your job back, Roy. You can drop the P.R. routine. But that was brilliant the way you used those kids. Nice going. You just have to sign here, Coach, and you get your old life back. (sighs) (sighs) You know, these kids, man, they really taught me a lot. And they've made me a better coach. Better than I ever was. Uh, uh, I think I see where this is going. I swear to you, Roy, we're giving you everything you want. Nah, nah. I don't... I don't think you know what I mean. Listen. Look, thanks for the offer, man, but I already got a team. I'm the coach, man, of the Mount Vernon Smelters. And I'm proud of that. Okay? Are you out of your mind? No. I'm not out of my mind. I found a group of kids that love the game of basketball the way I love the game of basketball. You know? So damn the fame, man. You know, I don't care nothin' about the year's supply of deodorant. I just want to have fun and teach these kids, man. So, thank you very much. I have a team to go coach. We're in the finals, and you're making me late. Wish me luck, will ya? Roy! How'd we do? Coach, it's rush hour. You're never gonna make it across town. It's gonna take you an hour. Okay. Let me get my stuff. (tires squeal) You got to get back on "D." What? You don't tell me what to do.

This is my team, baby. -(cheering) -Whoa! Whoa! Yeah! I was so right about you. I mean, from before, when I told you that you were an egomaniac. 'Cause no, not last night. Last night I was wrong. Oh.
