Thanks. Do you know, Molly, if Santa catches you working, you're gonna get coal in your stocking. Hey, Karen. I just have to finish this proposal. You're missing all the fun. And Derrick from accounting was asking about you. - Didn't you guys go out once? - We had dinner. And? And all we spoke about was Derrick from accounting. Done. There are other eligible men out there. Well, then, maybe you should date them. I would, I just don't think my fiance would approve. Yeah. I don't think mine would either. - Your fiance? - Yeah. I'm engaged to Manchester Software. We're spending Christmas together here in the office. So, you're working through another holiday? I am. But don't think of it as work, think of it as love. Excuse me, hey, hello everyone. Can I have your attention for just a minute? Hi, everyone. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. I hope you're all having a good time tonight. Yeah. Now, as most of you know, we've had a very good year here at Manchester Software. Our new product is very successful, and I'm very happy to report that our latest app just broke half a million downloads. Because this is all thanks to you, my team. And all your hard work. But, I'd especially like to thank Molly Clark, who went above and beyond the call of duty this year. Here's to you Molly. Now, that being said, I wanted to find some extra special way to say thank you for all the good work. So, I'm closing down the office... ...until the New Year. - What? - You'll all receive full pay for the two weeks, of course. Yeah. But, but, but, but, but, I don't wanna see anybody coming into the office, and that goes for you too, Molly. I mean it, I'm gonna change the alarm codes so you can't sneak in. - But anyway... - It's funny. ...look, just spend time with your families and your friends, and celebrate the holidays together. - Merry Christmas everyone. - Merry Christmas. I guess this means engagement is off. Jared, just wanna wish you a safe trip. Wish there was a better way to handle this, but I'm... Don't worry about it, I understand. Didn't have any plans anyway. Whatever happened to that young lady you were seeing? - It didn't work out. - That's too bad. Won't be my first Christmas alone. Yeah. Well, listen, Jared, I'm sorry that... I really should get going. And don't worry, I'll have this account off the books by the end of the year. Great. Well, thank you, and Merry Christmas, Jared. Merry Christmas, William. It's beautiful, huh? The Christmas lights. They're beautiful, isn't it? Oh, yeah. I hadn't really noticed. Good night. Look, I know Christmas is a tough time of year for you. So, why don't you have Christmas with us? - Karen. - You know, my mom and dad would love to have you. And you know, Dave and I could use another grown up around. You guys are the sweetest. I appreciate it, but I'm... What? I'm not very good company at Christmas. Okay. But if you change your mind, will you let me know, please? I will. Thank you. Of course. - Merry Christmas, Molly. - Merry Christmas. It sounds great. No, mom, I'm fine. Besides I have got so much work to do, I'm not even gonna realize it's Christmas. Listen, just enjoy the cruise and send me lots of pictures. I love you too. Merry Christmas. As part of our big Christmas getaway contest, you could be the next winner of our grand prize trip to Jamaica. Be the 15th caller and the prize is yours. The number is 555-S-N-O-W. And the lines are open now. Good luck. That's 555-S-N-O-W. Snow FM, who am I speaking to? Molly, Molly Clark. I'm sorry, Molly. That's okay. But you're gonna have to pack your bags, you're on your way to Jamaica. I was actually standing in line. - Oh, you were? - I was. I'm sorry, you wanna go ahead? No. No, that's fine. I'll just pull up the rear. Okay. Okay. - Here. - Jesus. - Sorry. - I'm sorry. See, here, I'll... Thank you. - Sorry. - That's quite the hat. Yeah, yeah. Thanks. Thought it would be perfect for Jamaica. Have you ever been to Jamaica before? - It's... - Excuse me. This is Molly. Hi, Mr. Roberts. No, no, no. I sent you the proposal and for approval to the department head. You didn't get it back? Well, let me check with the office... I mean, well, they're closed, but, thank you. Oh, no, I'm actually in line at the airport. I'm on my way to Jamaica. I won a contest. You are aware the... No, Mr. Roberts, I will take care of it. Yeah. But you know that... You got it. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. Here you are, Ms. Clark. All set. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Davis. All right. You've already checked in online, traveling to Jamaica... - ...Vermont. - Thank you. Enjoy your flight, Mr. Davis, and Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hi, how are you? - Hello. - Hi. Well, I sent you the proposal the night of the party. You should have got it in your email. Yeah. Well, Mr. Roberts called me and he still hasn't received it. So, let me check. Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Miss, we've closed the door. Yeah. I will be a second. I need you to put the laptop away and turn your phone off, please. - Okay. - Thank you. Okay. - What a coincidence. - Yes, it is. So you, you won a contest? Congratulations. - I've overheard in line. - Yes, my first time to Jamaica, looking forward to having my first authentic rum punch. Are you, traveling for business? Me? No. I'm... just needed to get out of the city for the holidays. I know the feeling. Christmas is so overwhelming. Not for me. I love it. - Oh, you do? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, snow, lights in the trees, hot cocoa by the fire. I don't get it. If you like Christmas so much, why are you on your way to the Caribbean? I'm not on my way to the Caribbean. No. - This plane is going to Vermont. - What? I knew this plane was too small. - Is there a problem? - Yes. I'm on the wrong plane. I'm supposed to be going to Jamaica, the real Jamaica, with the sand and the beach. Yeah. Well, according to this, this flight was booked to the other Jamaica in Vermont. So you're on the right plane. You're just going to the wrong place. Yes. I know that, and I'm trying to get a hold at the radio station, but I can't get online. Well, we don't have internet access of some of these smaller planes just yet. I... could you tell the pilot to turn the plane around, take me back to Chicago? I don't think the rest of the passengers would appreciate having their Christmas travel plans rearranged like that. But I'm sure as soon as we land, you'd be able to get it all straighten up. - Well, how long would that be? - Another two hours or so. And enjoy the flight. You're really enjoying this, aren't you? Me? No. No. I was just reading this really funny article about seatbelts. You know, you could have told me back at the airport. I tried, but you seemed pretty busy. You know what, how about we just not talk to each other - for the rest of our flight? - Okay. - Okay? - Fine. Fine. Something to drink? You know, I'm kind of craving, a rum punch, ...pina colada. What? Of course, I read the ticket. Well, I looked at it and nowhere did it say Vermont. Well, someone at your radio station's gonna have to fix this because I am not spending my vacation in a snowstorm. What? Hello? Hello? Great. That's just great. Hope everything works out for you. - I thought we weren't talking? - Right. Sorry. I forgot. Okay. Well, this is me not wishing you a Merry Christmas. Me, too. Oh, come on. Damn it. Where's my charger? Please don't say I left it at home. - Ms. Clark? - Yes. Well, you made it. Hi. I'm Chris, the owner of the Reindeer Lodge. Well, me and my wife are, welcome to Jamaica. I'm sorry. How did you know who I was? Well, you're just about the last person here, and, well, I just figured that, well, - ...let me give you a hand... - That's okay. Thank you. I need to get a hold of the airline. There's obviously been a mistake. I'm not supposed to be here. You're, Molly Clark, aren't you? Yes, I am. - But, I... - You know, we have a beautiful suite back at the inn, and it's all prepaid just for you. I appreciate that. Thank you. It's just... Looks like they're closing down for the night. - Airports don't close. - Well, this one does. It's a long walk back into town from here. You know what, I could probably come with you and figure this out in the morning. Well, that's the Christmas spirit. - Here we go. - Thank you. - Just follow me. - Okay. Yeah. Well, it's good we're leaving now. There's supposed to be a big, snowstorm blowing in. We'll be lucky to get home before they close the roads. Now, I hope you don't mind, traveling with an extra passenger. He's another one of our guests for the holidays. This can't be a coincidence. Well, this is our Jamaica. It's beautiful. Yeah. Well, we like it. How about some music? Not much selection this time of year. I hope you like Christmas music. I don't mind. Ms. Clark? Why not? Sorry about the lights, folks, I wanted everything finished before you arrive, but, Christmas just, came too quickly this year. They still look amazing, don't they? - Yeah. - The lights? Yeah. No. I just never gotten to the whole Christmas decoration thing, you know, spend all that time putting up the lights only to take them down a few weeks later. Okay. This way. Here. Let me... All right, folks, come on in. Honey, we're here. Well, hello, welcome to Reindeer Lodge. Molly and Jared, this is my wife. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey. - Hello. - Hello. Missis... - Oh, no. Call me Penny. It's Christmas. There are no strangers at Christmas. All right, then. Penny, it is. Dear, you need warmer clothes. Yes. Well, I, wasn't expecting it to be winter. There's seems to have been some confusion about Molly's travel. Oh, no. - That radio station. - Yeah. I told those fellas to be sure they mention it was in Vermont. Well, you're in our Jamaica now. So let's just get you settled in and we'll take it from there. - Yeah. - It might not be that bad. Looks like I don't have a choice, here. - I'll get that, just... - All right. It's okay. Thank you. Just right this way. Jared, you'll be in here. And Molly, you're just through here. Hope you don't snore. Okay. Here we go. I hope this room is okay for you. Yes. - It's very festive. - It's my favorite. The bathroom is right through there. If you need any more towels or linens, just let me know. I like to sleep with the window open a crack, but, you know, that's just me. And if you get cold, you can just slip into one of these. I like to keep extras for the guests. Okay. So, if you think of anything else you need, don't hesitate to ask. Is there, password for the internet? - No. - Great. No. I mean, there is no internet. Our guests seemed to like it that way. It helps them relax. So just make yourself comfortable and we'll see you for happy hour. Great. That's just great. I... they're very nice people. I just wish there was another way to... I understand, but they do have until Christmas Eve. One second. I'm gonna have to call you back. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. I don't suppose you have a power chord for one of this. I think the airport is trying to get a hold of me. Sorry, not my brand. You could use mine, but the reception's not very good. I don't think the Reindeer Lodge is in the cell grid. I don't think the Reindeer Lodge is in the 21st Century either. Maybe I'll have them try and call the hotel or something, and look, about earlier, I really didn't know that you didn't know... That I was going to the wrong Jamaica? Yeah. I'm sorry too, I didn't mean to be so rude. It wasn't your fault. I should've read the fine print. So what do you say? We... ...re-think the whole not talking to each other thing, at least for the night? - Deal. - Deal. Happy hour, come and get it. Shall we? Maybe you'll get that rum punch after all. So, we were in the woods this afternoon for like an hour, but still no sign of them. Yeah. They are going to show up, aren't they? Well, that's the thing about reindeer. They're kind of shy. Now, they're accustomed to me and my wife, but sometimes it takes some... a little time to get used to strangers. - That makes sense. - Shy Reindeer? That makes sense. Here they are. This is Molly, Jared, this is, it's Greg and Kayla. Hi. They're celebrating their... first wedding anniversary here. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Thank you. Wonderful. What brought you all the way out here? Well, we are photographers. Yeah. We're here, making our first book. It's gonna be Christmas prints and we hope to include some actual reindeer in their natural habitat. Then we figured what better place than the Reindeer Lodge. Wait, you have live reindeer here? Yes. A registered nature preserve. All 1,000 acres. So, do you think we'll see some reindeer tomorrow? Well, you never know exactly, but it's always worth a look. Then look we will. Those are beautiful. Did you carve them yourself? Yes. I got the wood shavings all over my carpet to prove it. Brought some happy hour treats for everyone. - Thank you. - Thank you. And one for you. This is, milk and cookies. - Boy, that's my favorite. - I shouldn't give you any. - Why? - My tree is still outside and Christmas Eve is a week away. Well, I'm gonna get to it. Don't worry. There's a lot of work here at Christmas. Sometimes our guests like to help us decorate. Do they? Well... To Christmas in Jamaica. To Christmas in Jamaica. Molly? Are you up? I am now. There's a phone call for you, someone from the airline? Okay. It's right over there, dear. Hi, this is Molly Clark. Very happy to hear from you. Greg, why don't you read our Christmas question for the day? All right. Absolutely. In the 12 days of Christmas, how many pipers are piping? On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me... Eleven days? What am I supposed to do in the meantime? Merry Christmas to you, too. Well, that's not a very Merry Christmas face. Well, every flight they have is booked until the end of the week. I mean, they said they will call me if there is a cancellation, but it's highly unlikely, being the busiest time of year. Tough break. Well, not for us. The more the merrier at Christmas. Absolutely. And look on the bright side, you guessed the right answer. Pipers piping... 11. You nailed it. Yeah. You get to open the advent calendar today. - It's that one. - Okay. And don't forget to read what's written inside. That's your Christmas message for today. Okay. Every Christmas is a journey. And, sometimes the destination is a surprise. Reindeer Lodge? Well, I haven't heard about that place in years. I use to take my kids up there when they were little. They had those reindeer tours. Do they still have those tours? Well, we haven't seen any reindeer yet, but we'll see. I don't think people are really interested in that kind of thing anymore. Maybe if you had a ninja reindeer robot, but, well, what about this? This is something very similar what Rosemary Clooney wore in White Christmas. No? Okay. I designed this for the mayor's wife. She wore it in the last Christmas Parade, did a great acclaim. It's not really me. Well. Here's something you can't say no to. This is gonna get you under the mistletoe. Do you have anything just a little less merry? Less merry? Certainly. I can find you something less merry. Be right back. Do you think Greg will like this? Well, you know, what they traditionally say, reindeer is the first anniversary gift. Well, I hope so. It's been a rough year, business has been slow, and I'm just hoping to get everything right for us this Christmas. Sorry that you got stuck here, but it is a cute little town. Yeah, no, it's not the town, it's just I usually avoid Christmas and, you know, well, here I am stuck right in the middle of it. - You don't like Christmas? - It just brings up some memories. - Good or bad? - A bit of both. Well, here it is. Utilitarian but understated. Less merry. - So, anybody special back home? - I'm not a relationship person. That is ridiculous. I believe there's somebody out there for everyone. Why do married people always say that to single... - Hi, honeybunch. - There you are. You know, I got some great shots for the book all we need now are those reindeer photos. You really like reindeer, don't you? His grandmother always says that a reindeer is the symbol of true love. It's actually a Nordic myth. Grandma is very old world. Yeah, I know it sounds a little weird but she always says that when a couple first meets, if they go into the wilderness under a full moon and they see a reindeer... - It means they are destined to be together. - Forever. You learn something new every Christmas. Yeah, my grandma bought me my first camera. We wanna dedicate this book to her so we got to have those reindeer photos in there. Why is it that my husband is so sweet? Well, it doesn't take a reindeer to tell me you guys are gonna be together forever. I'll catch up with you guys, okay? - Look at that. - Nice. So, you don't think I can get them, do you? No, I know you could get that. - You believe in me. - I love it. The Reindeer Lodge. I haven't thought about that place in years. My parents used to take me up there when I was a kid to see the reindeer. But I didn't think anybody even bother going up there anymore. Yeah, well, we did. Anyway, I don't suppose you have a... power cord for one of these, do you? - Yup. - Great. Well, I mean, I did. Yeah. I just sold the last one to... well, that fellow right there. I was gonna make you wait until Christmas, but, - I guess, you can have it. - Thank you. At least let me give you some money for it. That's a gift. It's Christmas. Okay, then, let me get you something. - Nah. - Come on. You got to find something in here interesting. This is beautiful. Well, those are actually one of a kind. Handmade right here in Jamaica. My dad got me something like this. You know what? Sorry, what? You wanna give me a gift? There's a place down the street that sells Vermont's version of a Jamaican rum punch. You wanna try it? Why not? - Here you go. - This is what I did. - Two hot buttered rums. - Thank you. Okay, so this is Vermont's version of the Jamaican rum punch. Okay. - It's really good. - Would I steer you wrong? - Well, we are in Vermont. - Okay. So, tell me about your reindeer. Well... when I was growing up, we didn't have much money so I used to make my own decorations. Let me guess, a toilet paper roll angels? Exactly. Marshmallow snowman? Those too. But, I can never make a reindeer because I could never get the antlers and the legs right. - They're complicated animals. - They're very complicated. Anyway, one Christmas Eve when I was eight years old, my dad was on his way home from work and he got stuck in a snow storm, and then it was just me and my mom. I'm so sorry. Yeah. But that morning, there was a little gift under the tree for me, and my mom said that my dad had left it for me. So, I opened it and he had carved me this, like, perfect little reindeer. It was really sweet. I wish I knew where it was now. - Christmas is complicated, huh? - Yeah, Christmas is complicated. So, what about your mom? You don't spend Christmas with her? No, she moved to Florida with her new husband. He's very lovely and... ...They're happy but... she has a new life and a new family. And I mean, they try to make me feel welcome but... I don't know, I just don't fit in anymore. What about your family? It was just me and my dad, not that close. Well, that's sad. Is that why you spend Christmas alone? Not exactly. It's just one of those things, you know. I have an idea. Come with me. Come on. To the Reindeer Lodge, good sir. This is happening. We're doing it. - Sorry, we're late guys. - No, no, no, you're right on time. Okay. Wait, hold up, hold up. I got to get that. All right. There we go. Perfect. Here you are. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. So... Wait, wait. Don't turn them on. I've got the cocoa. - Grab some cocoa, guys. - Thank you. We have a tradition here at Reindeer Lodge. Every year, we always toast to Christmas lights. All right. Everybody ready. Let's just hope I did this right. All right, here we go. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. To Christmas. To Christmas! To Christmas. - It's beautiful, darling. - Beautiful. - I love them. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely going in the book. - Look, that one came out perfect. - Yes. - I told you. - Yes. So... did that change your mind about Christmas lights? What do you mean? You still think it's not worth the trouble? I will let you know. - Jared? - Hi. Everything all right? Yeah, yeah, it's fine. It's just... How are things working out up there? Any problems? No. No, well, not really. It's just this place, it's... I mean, it's not just a piece of property, you know. I understand that. These things can be a bit tricky. Yeah. Well... and I've also got myself into a... bit of a situation here. What type of situation? - Hi. - Good morning. You sure are up early this morning. Yeah, well, the wife... gets tired of picking up these wood chips, so I had been banished to the great outdoors. Any sign of those reindeer yet? Well, nothing yet, but you never know. They have a habit of making an appearance when you least expect them. Do you think you could... show me how to do that? Sure. Give it a try. Well, please let me know if you have another cancellation. Okay, yes, Merry Christmas to you too. - Let me help you. - Thank you. - So, no luck with the airline? - Still no cancellations. They're fully booked until the New Year. I'm sorry. We sure have enjoyed having you here. Thank you, Penny, I'm sorry. I am having a nice time, it's just... this isn't how I expected to spend my Christmas. Well, you can't plan everything. Sometimes the best things in life are the things we weren't expecting at all. Help me decorate? I haven't done this in a long time. It's like riding a bike, you never really forget. I'll give it a try. You know, life is a lot like Christmas. Yeah, how so? Well, think about it. We have all these traditions, the Christmas lights, the music, the baking. And every once in a while, something comes along that surprises us, and who knows, if it fits, it could end up becoming a Christmas tradition, too. You know, Jared has been helping Chris all day out there. I bet he's worked up quite an appetite. Well, what do you think of this? I think he'll love it. - Hey. - Hey. So, what do you think, we got enough to make it through Christmas? I think we got enough to get it through until next Christmas. - Here. - What's this? Something to keep your strength up. Wait, did you make this? Well, I helped. This is delicious. - Really? - Yeah. Okay. For somebody who claims to not like Christmas, you sure make a mean gingerbread man. Yeah, well, spending my holidays at a place called The Reindeer Lodge, I figured I'd sink or swim. I better get back to the kitchen. Penny is a baking machine. - Molly? - Yeah? - No, just thanks for the cookie. - Yeah. Hey, guys, get closer together. Go. Perfect. We're going to the woods to look for some reindeer, - if you wanna come. - Come on. Folks. Folks. I'm sorry, I got some bad news, but... ...we have reindeer problems. What? So, the reindeer is sick? I know, it's rare but it does happen. And reindeer are very sensitive animals so I think it's best if I keep them quarantined for their own protection. But we can take one little picture, right? Well, no. I'm sorry, I just can't risk it and I'm not even sure you're gonna be able to see the reindeer before you leave. But that was the whole point of us coming up here. We base the entire book on this. I understand and... I'm sorry, and I really am. Maybe we could give you some sort of a refund? Yeah. That's really sweet, but it's not your fault. Of course, not, it just... It just means we have to rethink things, is all. - We'll figure something out. - Yeah. Molly, it is your turn to ask the Christmas question. Okay. "What does Santa Claus put in the stocking of those who have been naughty?" Coal. That's right. Here you go. A Christmas surprise will come your way. It already has. All right. Let's get back some of that Christmas cheer, guys. Yeah, why don't we put up that tree, after all? That's a wonderful idea. That is a great idea. Chris, where is it? It's outside leaning against the railing. - Which railing? - Next to the back door. Not anymore. I can't believe you actually chopped up the Christmas tree. How was I supposed to know? A tree is a tree, right? Not when it's laying up against the house looking all Christmassy, man. Guys, we just got to find a pine tree. Yeah, how hard can it be? The woods are full of them, right? Okay, what do you say we split off into groups? First group to find a suitable tree, call out, we all come together, cut it down, drag it back to the house. - Cool. - We got that. - Okay. - And I won't burn it. Let's go. Still rather be taking pictures of reindeer. Come on. So, you never did tell me what you do for a living. I work in finance. What kind of finance? Real estate. Properties mostly. Actually, I work for my father. Wait, I thought you said you didn't see your father? No, no, I said we weren't close. I see him every day. Well, do you think that's why you guys aren't close because you see each other all the time? It started before that. I was one of those boarding school kids who barely came home. Even at Christmas? Well, I have my own tree in my room and my dad would send me money for gifts. I'd buy them for myself, and then I'd wrap them up, put them under the tree, and then on Christmas day, I'd open them up and pretend to be surprised. But, I mean, not every year. Jared, that is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Actually... I don't know, I, kind of, liked being alone. Boarding school can be pretty noisy. Maybe that's why this is my favorite time of year. Sometimes at Christmas, it sounds like the whole world is taking a rest. Listen. Do you always spend Christmas alone? Not always. There have been a few, but this one's the first one that I thought I was definitely going to be alone. And I'm not. Well, Penny says that sometimes the best things in life are the ones that we aren't expecting at all. This Christmas is full of surprises. Is this the right time to let you know that... I'm glad you got on the wrong plane? Molly, Jared. - On our way. - Okay. - All right. - Come here. All right, yup. I guess Greg found the stables. What're you doing? Hey, Chris said the reindeer are sensitive. - Stop... - I'm not gonna bother them, I just need to get one picture. Hey, come on, man. Leave the reindeer alone, let's go find a tree. Hold on, hold on, I can almost see it. Wait a minute. What is it? Greg. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. - I don't see any reindeer. - Yeah. Because there aren't any. The Reindeer Lodge that has no reindeer. Truth is, we don't know what happened. Whether it was a change in the migration patterns or a change in the weather whatever it was, one day they just wandered off and never came back. Didn't you try and look for them? No because this is a nature preserve, not a zoo. What's the difference? Well, the difference is that we don't own these animals. They're free to come and go as they choose. So, they left? But why the big secret? Why not just tell us the truth from the beginning? Would you have come to a place called The Reindeer Lodge if you weren't gonna see any reindeer? The reindeer tours pay our bills. Things have been a little rough this year. I don't mind telling you... Look, I apologize... to all of you for not being upfront about all this. I hope you know we didn't mean you any harm. I... we really thought they were gonna come back. I mean, we really did. They usually do. Anyway... I better go get that tree for Penny. I'll help. So much for our book. Greg. - Hey, Penny. - Hello, dear. Can I get you anything? No, I just wanted to see if you needed any help with the baking. Oh, no, thanks. I'm all cookied out. Did Chris tell you? Penny, we're not gonna say anything to anyone. You're very sweet, dear. But it's not just about that. And I got some bad news in the mail today. I guess, we've fallen a bit behind on the bills and things. Will it help when the reindeer come back? Afraid that really won't make much difference. People aren't too interested in our reindeer tours these days. Sign of the times, I guess. Why come all the way up here to see a real reindeer when you can just watch them on your phone. I really thought the radio contest might help, but all that did was bring you somewhere you never really wanted to be in the first place. Hey, you're not gonna lose your home, are you? Well, home is just a place, dear. The heart can travel. I do worry about Chris though. He loves this place so. Anyway... you do not need to worry about us. We will be fine. It's Christmas. Okay, tighten her up and I think we got it. And perfect. - It looks pretty good? - Yeah. - It looks great. - Yeah. What's up? It's just that's about the last tree they get to see in this house. The company that owns the mortgage on this place is gonna foreclose. No. If they don't come up with the money before Christmas Eve, they're gonna lose Reindeer Lodge. Surely there's something that we can do. Hey, Kayla, what's wrong? Everything. Okay. Hey... anything I can do? I really thought the two of us coming up here will be a good thing, you know. After the year we had, he just really want his book to work out, but he's feeling like a failure. And we just had a really big fight. You know, I'm not really an expert at this sort of thing but... I've watched you guys together, you're crazy about each other. Do you know how rare that is? People go their whole lives looking for what you guys have. I know you've only been married a year, but, it's not like Christmas lights. Put all that work in for a few weeks to twinkle just to shut it down January 1st. You guys are in this for the long run. What you guys have got is special. You need to treasure it. If I ever find what you and Greg have, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life doing everything in my power to keep those lights on. - Thank you. - Yeah, come here. - That's so beautiful. - Thank you. These are our Christmas treasures. Each one is a gift from someone who spent the holiday with us. This one is from the Carters, they had two small children and a great big dog who used to come in from the snow and shake all over the carpet. - May I help? - I would love for you to. - What about this one? - That's from the Marshall family. Mr. Marshall was a cellist and he played the most beautiful music in this room on Christmas Eve. - How about this one? - That's Mrs. Worthington. She brought her young daughter who was an actress who recited, "The Night Before Christmas" in front of that fireplace, doing all by heart. Can I help? Of course, Kayla, just go grab one you like. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. You wanna do this together? - Yes. - Yeah? - Yes. - Okay. - You got a reindeer for me. - Sure did. Got it? All right, everybody ready? One, two, three. My goodness. Thank you, everybody. It's just so beautiful this year. Yeah, that's Christmas. Everything is gonna be just fine. - Hey. - Hey. I was just out here grabbing some wood for the fire. Let me help. - Okay. - You know, I wish there was something we could do for Chris and Penny. Yeah, I know. But business is business, right? No, it's not just a business, Jared. It's a tradition and it's Christmas. I mean, we can't let anything happen to Reindeer Lodge, it must be wrong. What? Nothing, I just... I like looking at you when you talk like this. Like what? I just didn't expect to see you get so excited about Christmas. I just think there's something special about this place. - Well, the reindeer? - That too. I have an idea. - What is it? - Can you cook? Kinda. Can you read Penny's writing? Let's see. Either cranberries or Ecuador... I'd go with cranberries. Have you ever made one of these Christmas dinners before? No, but I just feel like, everybody could use the break right now. Especially Penny, you know. I mean, besides, everyone does this. How hard could it be? You're really getting into this whole Christmas thing? Reindeer Lodge, is that place still in business? Yeah, it sure is. Let me guess, it was a family tradition. I haven't been there since I was a kid. But I remember we used to go every year. I mean, where else can you find reindeer? - Yeah, where else? - Where else? - Canada. - Really? Northern Quebec to be exact. There is a reindeer preserve up there that has an overpopulation problem. You're really considering contacting these people. I already did. They know the situation and they're willing to help us. Okay, beyond everything else though, have you considered how expensive something like this is gonna be? You're talking about relocating an entire herd of reindeer. I know. We're gonna need some help. - Oh, boy, that smells wonderful. - Looks delicious. I don't think we've ever had our guests make their own Christmas dinner. Oh, gosh, Molly. I don't know. Northern Quebec is a long way away. Yeah. Even if we could afford it, I don't think Santa Claus himself could deliver a herd of reindeer by Christmas Eve. No. But I think that if the people in town knew what was happening, they would wanna help save Reindeer Lodge. Molly's right, you know, and your lodge is a tradition in this town. We just need to remind people how important it is. What if we have some sort of fundraising? Like an auction. - That's a good idea. - It is a good idea, but there's just one problem. We don't have anything to auction off. Actually, we do. Excuse me. Can you help me find the Reindeer Lodge? We used to use this to play music for the reindeer at night. Thought it might come in handy for the party. - Used to play the reindeer music? - Yeah. They were very partial with this one. Chris? Chris, I need you up here, please. Excuse me. Duty calls, I'll be right back. - Hey, Jared. - Yeah. Do you think this is gonna work? I don't know. But I do know that we've done our best. Okay. You heard anything from the airline? You know what's funny? I have lost all desire to travel this holiday season. - All right. - Yeah. Did you mean what you said to Kayla? You heard that? Well, I didn't mean to but yeah, a little, a lot. I heard all of it. So, it sounds like you're gonna land on Santa's naughty list. - Really? - He frowns on eavesdropping. Well, I didn't think of it as eavesdropping. I thought of it more as research. Well, in that case, I meant every word I said. So, how was that research? You know, I think I could use a little bit more studying. That didn't take long at all. I'm sorry to interrupt but this said gentleman wants to look around the property. His company owns the deed to the lodge. I apologize for the intrusion. So many surprises this Christmas. I'm sorry. Didn't Jared tell you why I was coming? You guys know each other? Molly Clark, let me introduce you to the president of Davis Investment Corporation, William Davis, my father. - Molly, wait, let me explain. - It's a little late for that. - I didn't mean to hurt you. - Really? - Then why did you lie to me? - I didn't. I mean, not exactly. Well, I told you I work for my father's corporation. Yes, and you conveniently left out the rest. What was I supposed to say? You want a trip? I'm here to foreclose on two sweet, old people and their reindeer ranch. No, but I would have appreciated the truth. I know, I know and I'm sorry. I just... this is... This is the first Christmas that's meant something to me. I didn't wanna lose that, or you. Molly, there's a phone call for you. Thanks. Hello? You do? 1:30, flight 1711. Thank you, thanks. They find you a seat? Yeah, there's a cancellation on tomorrow's flight to Chicago. Oh, well. Good. Well, don't worry, I'm still gonna be here tonight to help with the auction. It's not that, dear. It's just... Well, we've enjoyed having you here and... you're gonna miss Christmas. Come here. Maybe it's for the best. I think I've had about all the Christmas I need this year. Smells great in here. Jared, may I have a word with you? Not a good time, William. You know, for all the Christmases you've missed in my life, why do you have to show up with this one? - Come in. - Hi, can you zip me, please? Guys in the stables are rearranging the photos for, like, the hundredth time. He thinks this is our first public showing which it is. You guys are great and you take wonderful pictures together. Thank you. Penny told me that you got a flight for tomorrow. I can't believe you're actually going to leave. Yeah, it's been fun but time to get back to the real world. - What about Jared? - What about him? He's not part of that. Molly, you stopped me from making the biggest mistake of my life. I'm gonna return the favor. I appreciate what you're about to say but... But nothing, Jared made a mistake. Okay. For Christmas, it's the time for forgiveness, you know. I told you I'm not a relationship person. Exactly. Which is why you're not an expert on this one. It's still early. The posters said 7:00, it's almost 8:00. Thank you. I guess that people have something better to do two days before Christmas. Good evening. Looks like I'm a little early. Well, this must make both of you very happy. This time tomorrow night, Reindeer Lodge will be all yours. I'm gonna step outside. It's a little stuffy in here. - Molly. - Jared. - Could we have that word now? - Not right now, William. Please? Hello. Would you like a cookie? Sure. Thank you. - Molly, can we... - Hey. Hey. I was just telling Molly and Kayla here why we're all so late. Mrs. Elliot's cows got out and blocked the main highway, nobody could pass. We all had to take the side road. I... just about the whole town is on the way. You know, everybody just loves this place. Around here, you could say that the Reindeer Lodge - has been a real... - Tradition. Sure it has. I'll see you all inside. Hi. - Thank you. - This looks great. Thank you, good. Darling... Excuse me. - Thank you for coming. - Thank you. - It's so nice to meet you. - This look great. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much. Thank you, appreciate you coming. Congratulations. Great party. Yeah, Director Kayla's photographs are so better than expected, if it stays like this, Reindeer Lodge will have a very bright future. Thanks to you. Are you leaving tomorrow? Yeah, I have to go back to work. It's where I belong. Thought you weren't sure about that. - Well. - What if you belong here with me? Well, then think about my businesses and there are no unexpected surprises. Molly, I wanted to tell you the truth. I did, it's just by the time I built up the courage to do it, I realized that I was falling for you. I'm really sorry, Jared. I got to go. Merry Christmas, you guys. Thank you. You know, your grandfather used to do that, sit and whittle for hours, drove your grandmother crazy. Sorry you wasted your time coming up here. What do you mean? Tonight was pretty successful. It looks like Penny and Chris would be able to keep the lodge running for quite a while. Well, I didn't come up here for business. I knew you'd be able to handle it just fine whatever the outcome. Why are you here? I came up here to see you. Me? You see me every day at the office. We pass each other in the hallways and barely say hello. All of our conversations involve either contracts or writing our contracts, or signing. Well, that's how you wanted it. I know and I also know that's my fault. Listen Jared, I'm gonna be retiring this year and, I'm trying to get a few things straight in my life and one of those things is you and me. What's this is for? I know I'll never be able to make up all those years to you but... to me, that's just a figure on a balance sheet with all these people up here. Tonight, it's obviously much more than that. Yes, it's a part of the town, it's... they love it and I've only been here a little while, - I can tell why, it's... - Well, I knew you had something else on your mind. I could hear it in your voice on the phone. I wish to get back to Chicago but let's not let another year go by without making time for family. Merry Christmas, son. Merry Christmas, dad. Are you sure? All right. I'll take it out to the cab - for you. - Thanks. Put in a few extra gingerbread men, you never know about that airline food. - Thank you, Penny. - No. Thank you for all you've done, without you I... Well... Well, there is only one door left. That you have a question? I could but I think - you already know the answer. - Well... I'll save it for later then. Aren't you gonna say goodbye to Jared? We've already said our goodbyes. - Merry Christmas. - Hey, safe travels, okay? - Merry Christmas. - Okay. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you. Traveling on Christmas Eve, huh? Must be going to meet someone special. No, I'm a... I'm just on my way home. This Christmas gift is love. - Beg your pardon? - Never mind. Hi, Mr. Roberts, it's Molly Clark from Manchester's Offer, we spoke last week about the proposal. I know it's Christmas Eve but... No, I do have a life, I... Not a problem, we can speak after the Holidays. Okay, bye. - Hi. - Hi, where are you traveling to? - Chicago. - Last name? Clark, Molly Clark. Last name, Clark. Here you are. Picture ID. Passport, driver's license? Yes, of course, I really like your Christmas decorations. I haven't really noticed, we've been busy this week. Miss, your ID? I need it if you're planning to travel today. Miss? - I don't understand. - It's yours. My father gave it to me. I'm giving it to you. I'll set it up as a permanent trust, so it'll be yours and this town's forever. What? Jared. Jared... I don't know what to say. It's Christmas. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas, Jared. - Merry Christmas, man. - Merry Christmas. I'm gonna go get some logs for the fire. Sounds like the whole world is taking a rest. I found this in my bag. I didn't know what else to do except to say, "I'm sorry". I didn't mean to lie to you. I'm sorry, too. I shouldn't have run away. I was... I was afraid. Of what? Of this, of us taking a chance, I really didn't expect my Christmas to be like this. Well, we're even then because I didn't expect to ever see you again and you're here. So, what happened? Did you get on the wrong plane again? No. I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. - Hey, everyone. - Chris, Penny. What's wrong? - We found a reindeer. - What? - Where? - In the woods. There's like five or six - of them. - Actually eight. - You already knew? - Yes, isn't it lovely? You know, they say that the reindeer is the symbol of true love. I knew it. You know, we were afraid they might not come, that it would take some sort of Christmas magic but I think you all brought that. You brought your love, young love, and new love. I think true love brought the reindeer. - We have to tell Chris. - Chris knows. Guys, guys. Guys, guys. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
