[GASPING] [LAUGHING] -The sky! The trees! People! Oh, people. Real people. Oh, people! Real people! [SCREAMING] -Real people! Oh, my god, you don't know how good it is to see you! Do you know where I've been? Do you know? I've been abducted by aliens. It's true. -Wow, what a story. -OK. You've convinced us. -Yeah? -Yeah. We'll buy some of what you're smoking. -Damn. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You look just how I feel. I'm-- I'm lonely. I've got no one. There's no one for me. [SIGH] -Well, I could stand to be alone. I just spent the last two years with an alien probe up my ass 24/7. Dozens and dozens and dozens of those gray bastards surrounding me, never leaving me alone, not for one second of the day. -Really? I mean, I've always heard about alien abductions, of course, but I've never actually met anyone who's been abducted before. -Well, now you have. -And the stories about alien probes? -Oh, they're true, all right. No, they're worse. They're worse than what you would hear. -And, uh-- how did they pick you? -Do you know that old expression, be careful of what you wish for, because it may come true? Well, I was this investigative news journalist on this television show called "The Search for--" -Intelligent life? Of course I've heard about that. -Huh? Anyway, I was trying to prove the existence of alien beings on the planet Earth, and I finally found my proof. The problem is that they found me, too, and now here I am, two years later. -You mean you just got back? -Yep. -So all this time, you were-- and they were-- with their machine? -Yeah, right up the old dirt road. -Constantly? -Nonstop. -No breaks at all? -None whatsoever. -And all of this happened because of your TV job? -Absolutely. -Was the exploration thorough? -Do you mind? Oh. Take it easy. See you later. -Oh, OK. Sure. I'd like that. -Hey, guys. I know you don't know me or anything, but do you think I could borrow some cash? Maybe not. -What the fuck are you wearing? -Excuse me? Hey, excuse me. -Holy shit. What happened to you? -I was probed. No, I was mugged. I-- I was mugged. I was mugged. -You want me to call the police or something for you? -No, I'll-- I'll call them later when I've thought everything through. -All right. Fine by me. Hey, listen, there was this guy that worked here. It was about two years ago. I think he worked-- he worked days. -Two years? Ha. I mean, I'm lucky if I can remember two weeks ago. Got this damn metal plate in my head. -Yeah, right. This guy, he's about-- oh, I don't know. -Can I get you a drink or something? -No. Yes. Actually yes. Whatever you have on tap. Beer, please. -Should I call the police? -You already did. Man, that's good. So this guy worked here. -What guy? -The bartender. -I'm the bartender. -How long have you been the bartender? -You know, I'm not so good with time and dates, you know, ever since my accident. Got this metal plate in my head. I told you about my accident, right? -This guy was about yea tall, he had brown hair, and he sold joins from behind the bar. -Oh, yeah. You're talking about Mike. Mike Cosim. Oh yeah, man. He sold joints behind the bar, he sold joints out of his house, his apartment. He sold them on the internet. Crap, he put eBay out of business. -Hey, does he still work here? -Well, you know, nah, he's a big TV star now. He hosts some show. A popular show. What's the name of that damn show? -"The Search for Intelligent Life." -Yeah, that's it. That's one of my favorites. -I don't believe it. -Oh, yeah. He's big time. He's following all the UFO sightings for the last couple years. Keeping [INAUDIBLE] about aliens and stuff. -What UFO sightings? -Where have you been living, man, under a rock? -I wish. -That's one of the most popular shows on TV. Second most popular. The first is that transvestite Survivor. Ugh. That one gives me the creeps. -Oh, god. I need to us your men's room. I'm not feeling very well. My asscheek hurts. -Yeah, you can go right ahead. What the hell happened to you? -This can't be happening to me. When I was on the show, it was on its last leg. Well, Al Manac is back. I'm going to bring those ugly alien bastards down. They've probed their last reporter. [GASP] -Albert? Look at me, Albert. -Obey, human. -What? -Obey! -What do you want? -Albert, we can take you back anytime we want. -No, no, I'm not going back. -Prepare the [INAUDIBLE]! Disobedience! Energize the galactic probe! -And you will listen and obey. We have a mission for you. -What? What are you talking about? What mission? -The human race is very close to proving our existence. This would be bad for business. We wish to stay hypothetical. -What? What are you afraid of? Are you afraid we're going to rise up against you and you won't have any more humans to probe for your amusement? -Yes. Probing is great fun. -I won't do anything for you, you ugly alien bastard. I'm going to bring you down. -Human threatens us. Energize the anal probe! -Albert, you have a tracking device implanted in your asscheek. We know where you are at all times. If you do not do what we tell you to do, we will bring you back for more proving. -No, please, no! -Then you will following instructions, or I will probe you personally. -Yes, now. Please, now. -Hello? Come on. Let me in there. Gotta go. -Do you understand your first assignment? -Yes. I understand. -Hello? How'd it go? Come on. You've been in there long enough. What the hell happened to you? -Hey, man. How you doing? -Hi. -Hey, uh, don't I know you from somewhere, there, buddy? -No, I don't think so. I've never been to prison. -You're a pretty funny guy. Name's Smiley. -Yeah, Al. Hi. -Nice to meet you. -You know, I know I've seen you somewhere before. -Yeah, I get that a lot. -It wasn't that show "Transvestite Survivor," was it? -No. -Good, because I hate that show. -Yeah? -Yeah. My audition was a total disaster. -Well, you know, I think it's about time for me to get out of here. -Sit down. I got it. Al Manac! Al Manac, the maniac! Oh, my god, I don't believe it, man. You're great! -Well, in that case, I'm him. -You know, my buddies and I used to watch your show all the time. All the time. Never finished the whole thing, though, because I was drunk as hell by 8 o'clock. Yep. It was just to get a little laugh in because we could-- who's that stupid ass panty ass asswipe guy with the goofy name? -Well, thanks, I guess. I'll take that as a compliment. I know we just met and all, but do you think I could borrow some cash? -Hell, no. -OK. [TOILET FLUSHING] -What can I get for you gentlemen? -Hey, Barky. You might not remember me, but I'm the guy that comes in here and robs your place all the time. -No kidding! -Yeah. -It's me. Look, just give me the cash. -Hey, buddy. -What? -Why don't you join me? -Can't you see what's going on? -Don't shoot. -Look, by the time I get back to the car, you won't even know what happened. -Aw, that's nothing new. -Hey. Don't shoot. Come again. -Take it easy, Al. -Sure, sure. See you next week. -Hey, why don't you sit down? I've got something to tell you. OK. First things first. I know what it's like to be a homeless bum. I was a homeless bum for years after the war. Then I found this place. Now I'm just an asshole. You know what I discovered? -What's that? -Being an asshole's better. I'm going to give you some advice. Try and be an asshole. -Yeah, all right. I'll try and be an asshole. Listen. Can I borrow some money? I've been away for a long time, and, you know, I just got back, and, um, I could really use some cash. Do you think you could-- a little bit? I could pay you back. What do you think? -Sure, I could do that. -Really? -Oh, fuck yeah. But first you gotta do something for me. -What's that? -Oh, yeah. Oh, that's fucking great. Oh. Get your fingers in there. Oh, that's it. Work it. Work it around. Oh, you've got magic hands. You've got magic hands. G-- give me some of them kung-fu chops. Oh, yeah, yeah. Harder. Harder, you fucking wimp. Sing happy birthday to me. Sing happy birthday to me. -Come on, man. -Sing it, sing it you homeless bastard. Sing it. -(SINGING) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday you asshole. -Oh, yeah. -Happy birthday to you. -Hey, I'm next. Yo, over here. Me, next. -Randall. -Mom. Mom! Mom? Mom! Mom! You'll never guess what just happened to me. -Sweet Baby Jesus. Can't you see I'm trying to watch my story? -I just met that reporter, the one who was abducted two years ago on that show, "The Search for Intelligent Life"? -Whatever, Randall, don't get your bugger in a knot, boy. -Mom. -By the way, what have you been eating? -Mom-- -It's not normal, Randall. How many times have I got to tell you, you gots to wipe your ass? You're not listening, Mama. -These drawers would make a whore sick. -The reporter from "The Search for Intelligent Life," the one who was abducted, he invited me to take part in his TV show! -Oh, Randall, you're not taking part in nothing. You're not doing anything, either. I have something to take part in. You can take part in wiping your goddamn ass. -Mom, you don't understand. I'm going to be on TV. And I'm going to be a cameraman on his show. -Oh, shit. Don't you lie to me, boy. -No, Mom. I'm not lying. -That you would lie to your own mother. -Mom, I'm not lying. I'm really going to be on this show. I'm going to get this book on TV production, and I'm going to learn all about it, and they're going to hire me, and then I'm going to be a cameraman, and then I'm going to get kidnapped by aliens, and probed inside and out, and you're going to miss me when I'm gone. -Oh, honey, you're not going anywhere. And you ain't doing nothing, either. And you want to know why? Because you're worthless. Honey, you ain't much more than a stain yourself. Nothing but a lousy stain. One day I squatted, and there you were, stinking up everything. And no matter how hard I try to scrub you out of my life, you just won't go away. You're nothing but a lousy stain, a blight on humanity, you little jerk. -I'll do it. You'll see. I'll do it. -Please. -Woah, woah, woah. Hold it, pal. -They know me in there. I'm Al Manac. I used to be a reporter. -Al Manac. It's you. -Oh, no. -Oh. Al Manac, it's me, Dick Skyward. I can't believe it's you. So, Al, we didn't ever think we were going to see you again. This is unprecedented. Al Manac returns after a two-year abduction to earth. -Woah, woah, woah, Dick, for a second. First of all, I wasn't abducted. I was just on an extended vacation, that's all. -Well, sure you were. There were two witnesses. -I don't want some rumor going around that I was abducted by space aliens. -Oh, no, they did a mind wipe on you. -A mind what? -A mind wipe. It's what the aliens do now. They abduct some poor guy or some gal and do God knows what to them, you know, bam, mind wipe. -But I wasn't abducted. -Mr. Herman. Guess who's back? -Well, fuck me. -Max Herman. -In the flesh, baby. -So, it was a really long vacation. I mean, that's, pretty much it. Really that's-- that's what happened. -What do you mean, you weren't abducted? There were witnesses. There was an investigation. I went to your funeral. -My funeral? -Yeah, it was really nice. -Listen, Max, it's not true. I just quit. I just quit my job. That's all that happened. I was not abducted. -That's what you think. You-- you were obviously mind wiped. -I was not mind wiped. -How would you know? -It's just not true, Max. It's just not true. -Let's just say for discussion's sake that you're right. I don't care. Our ratings went up like my pulse rate at a live porn show, and it's all due to your disappearance. Oh. You should have seen it, Al. We played it beautifully. Dedicated reporter, cut down in the prime of his career. A victim of his own determined investigations. You're a hero, buddy. Let me get this straight. I work here, I can't get an ounce of respect. -Uh-huh. -I disappear and I'm a hero? -Big hero. Not just with us in the studio here, but you're famous all over the world. -This is a nightmare. -Since you've been gone, the whole world is taking notice of these alien scumbags. Reports are coming in from all over the world. People are getting abducted at a record pace. -I've got to go to the bathroom. -What, do you want me to write you a hall pass to the little boys' room? -It's not going to work. I'm too high-profile to start changing sides on this issue all of a sudden. -Albert, you must complete the mission. -How? I'll be an even bigger celebrity if I rejoin the show. -You must. Remember, you have two choices. Be our inside guy, or be probed inside out. -Ah! Jesus, guys, Give me a break. -That's just what we're going to do. We're going to put you back in the show. You're going to make me a rich man. What do you say, Al? -All right. I'll do it. -That's great to hear, Al. -So, if you're running the show, who's the host? -Mike. Hey, I want to introduce you to Al-- -Al fucking Manac! Is that really you? -It's me. -Damn, dog, you're looking good. -Al's coming back to work with us. -No shit. That's fucking awesome. Listen. I got to go tape a promo. Give me one minute and, uh, we'll go smoke a gigantic joint. -Keep an eye on him, Al. He'll never quite be as good as I was, but he's got a lot of charisma. And he grows some great marijuana. I'm telling you, I ate a porkchop with hot fudge. I had the munchies so bad. -Woah, hold on a second. You're the producer, Mike's the host, who's got my job? -That would be me. I thought they were pulling my leg around the office. The incredible Al Manac has returned. But here you are. Nice suit. -Al, this is Ernest Hack. -Yeah, nice to meet you, Hack. -Likewise. You know, your story is going to make a great segment. -Yeah, thanks for keeping my seat warm. -Ready, Mike? -You know it, Bro. I'm Mikero Cosim. This Friday on "The Search for Intelligent Life," we bring you a tale of terror so terrifying you won't want to go outside. Plus, we welcome back an associate that was held captive by extraterrestrials for two years. That's right, folks. Al Manac is back. -Hello, this is Al Manac. I'm here with Herb Stone, who was supposedly abducted by space aliens or some nonsense like that. So go ahead and tell us your story. -What? Oh, right. My story, yeah. Um. Well, I was like, woah. Wow. Trippy tie, man. I can't concentrate with that. -Oh, I thought something might be breaking your concentration. -So yeah, anyways, um, my girlfriend and I, we were out in the woods camping, and-- You can't do that with the tie. You've got to stop, dude. It's totally tripping me out. -Are you OK? Are you hallucinating or something? -What? Hallucinating? No, bro. Anyways, bro, we were out in the woods camping and I thought we were going to break up. All of a sudden, Al, out in this field there's this, like, bright light, you know? And then all of a sudden BOOSH! Zap, we're up on this ship. -Uh-huh. -That's then the probing started. It was like, oh. First it was the blade probe. Then it was the hot wax probe. And then it was the inverted, rotating, radar probe. Woah. It was all really intense. -I'm sure it was. -You know, it was kind of a bonding experience. We're still together. -It's a lovely story. Personally, I don't believe a word of it. I think it's just some marijuana-induced hallucination. What do you think of that? -Oh, yeah, totally, bro. We're doing here, Mac. We're done. -Woah, woah, woah. Wait, dude. -What? -I love the show, man. I love the show. It's like the greatest thing ever. It's like, Al Manac, "Search for Intelligent Life," bro. Woah. Al Manac. Intelligent life, haha. Woah. -Oh, hi, buddy. -Oh, hi. -It's me, Randy Bottom. Remember, from the park? -What are you doing here, Randy? -You said to come by and see you again, so here I am. I read this book on production. I'm going to be a cameraman, even though I know they might take me up and, you know-- -Good luck with that. -Thanks. I'll see you again soon! -Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Al Manac. I'm here with Hans Hinternstab who claims to have been abducted by aliens. So, level with me, Hans. You're manic depressive, and this is just another grab for attention, isn't it? -What are you going to do? Just insult me here? -Yeah. -Can I tell my story? -No. -Everyone knows that most people get mind wiped when they're up there. They have no memory of the-- while the aliens are-- and they're sticking things and it-- zzz-- You've been up there, too? -No. -No, I can tell. You've been up there, too. -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. -I can tell. Just because you can't remember doesn't mean that you weren't up there. The mind wipe can take away a lot of things, but it doesn't take away the zzzz. -You were saying how people can't remember, but obviously you can remember, right? -Yes. The last time I was up there, I was-- I was on the table and, these guys were-- they were all around me. And then they took this-- and they put it in my-- and-- and then the zzz--- -Just stop making that noise. -Sorry, I forgot you were there and they were sticking things in your ahem. -Look, Hansy, you said you'd have irrefutable proof of your alien abduction, but I've seen nothing. There is no proof. So, ladies and gentleman, by the way, we just chalked this one up as just other nut job. [BUZZING SOUND] -What the hell is that? I asked you not to-- -It's horrible, isn't it? It's like a dentist's drill, just a million times worse. -Where is that coming from? -The last time I was up there, there was this huge explosion. And I got off that table as fast as I could. I ran down a hallway, got into the transporter as fast as I could, and I bolted from there. But I didn't go empty-handed. Or, perhaps I should say, empty-- -What proof? You're-- you're a liar. You're insane. -Proof? -You're an insane liar. -You want me to show you the proof? I'll show you the proof right now. I don't just hear the zzz from memory. I hear it because it's still in my ass. -Dear god, Jesus. The damn thing's still active, and it's still proving. Touch it. Go ahead, feel it. Touch it. Look at that. It's like no other metal you've ever felt before. -Sir. Sir. I'm going to have to ask you to leave. You're a sick guy. Get out of here. You're out of here. You're sick. -Bye. Thanks for coming. -Good afternoon. This is Harris Crep, Worldview News. WFUK, channel 69. Standing here outside the "Search for Intelligent Life" studio. We're here waiting for the confirmation of the blockbuster rumor that Al Manac has returned after two years' abduction by aliens. Well, I see somebody here. Ah, hello, hello. Ah, do you work for the show? -Oh, no, I um-- yes. Yes, I do work for the show. I'm a cameraman, see? You see, I got this book here. -Have you seen Al Manac? Has he really returned? Oh, yes. In fact, I'm the first person he called. We're very close friends, he and I. Very close friends. -Has he spoken to you about all the details of the abduction ordeal? -Oh, yes. In great detail. It really made me think twice about continuing on with the show. But I figured, if Al was brave enough to come back to the show that got him abducted in the first place, then what have I got to lose? In fact, I have a message for the aliens that abducted Al. I dare you to abduct me. I dare you. -Hello, I'm Ernest Hack, and I'm here today with Bo Foster of Foster's Pickle Farms. -So, Al, tell me-- -Woah, woah, woah. Relax. It's not Al. It's Ernest. The good-looking one. Al's not showing up. I'm here. I'm doing the interview. Let's, uh, get back to the subject. You claim that the aliens were performing some sort of experiment on your pickles? -Yep, that's right. -Why didn't they perform these experiments on your cow or some damn thing? -Don't have cow, Al. -I'm not Al. -This is a pickle farm. You want a pickle? -No, no, no, no. I don't know where that thing's been. -Well, the aliens, they've been flying overhead. They've been landing in my Dad's backyard. I reckon they either done something on purpose, or-- or the radiation in them gadgets done this. Check him out. -Wow. That's one hell of a pickle, there, ah, Bo. -This here's the first ripe one. I got another 20 like him back there in the fields. The only problem is, the skin's a little tough. -Ah-- -I've got a little Vaseline here to kind of soften up the hide. -W-- Why-- What are-- what are you dong with that? -Like to rub it in nice and good. -Man, that's just wrong. -Want to take a little try on this, here, Al? Here, take a dip. -No. No, thank you, no. Thank you, no. I'd rather talk about the aliens. -Get some of that stuff on there. How are you going to sell that thing with your teeth marks in there? -Want to take a bite? -No, I don't want to take a bite, Bo. -This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here, Al. -Yeah, I got a feeling that's been more than once in your lifetime. -Hold on there, Al. Hold on. -Leave the pickle alone. Put it down. You said you've got 20 of them? -Put a little more Vaseline on there. -He's got a smile on his face. -Get it all over, down on that shaft. -Stop. -Now don't you go anywhere. -I'm out of here. -Hey, come on back here, Al. -It's Ernest, cupcake. -Come take a bite of my pickle. Take a bite of my pickle. -Randall! Where are you going? -I'm just going out for a walk. -Oh, that I ever kissed that lying hole of yours. Your nose should be in the next state, you lying-- -I'm not lying, Mama, I'm just going for a walk. I'm going right now. -Randall! Randall! It's not safe out there with all those filthy germs-- -There's one. -Take him. -Ooh, look at that one. -Dibs. -I saw him first. -You're so stingy. -Oh, look. A human woman. A female. -Prepare the stereo probe. -You mean, you're going to probe her in her ass and her-- -Yes. I am. Pay attention. You almost missed one. -Oh, boy oh boy. He's going to get it now. Prepare the-- -No. Wait. -Wait why? -There's something about this one. Something not right. -Oh, you've been sniffing too much cow vapor. What are you talking about? Prepare the-- -No. I'm serious. Zoom in closer. -OK. Whatever you say. God. You've got to be kidding me. -Buzzkill. -I feel strange. Soiled. Well, should I? -No, no. Let him be. Let him be. I'm-- I'm going straight to sleep cycling. -But you can't do that. You're scheduled for 12 probings. -Cancel them all. And schedule me for a mind wipe while you're at it. -But we don't do that to our own. -Look, do you want to have that image in your head for the rest of your life? -No. Ah. There's an opening at 0600 and I can follow at 0715. -See to it. -Hey. Come here. Hey, dude, you've got a pipe in your ass. -It's not a pipe. It's an alien probe. Seriously. It's like nothing you've ever felt before. Go ahead, touch it. It's a genuine alien probe. Come on, touch it. Touch it, man. Go ahead, see it, man. You smartass. -Hello, this is Al Manac. I'm here with Grammy-nominated Ilya from the band Bering Strait. Why don't you tell us your story about being abducted by space aliens? -OK. -OK, so I saw aliens, all right? I saw aliens. I mean, they tell you about this anal probing bullshit? Ain't about that, man. They ain't got no anus, man. You know? What the deal is, they're searching. They're trying to find where the anus is. And the aliens that I met? It's in the naval. The naval is where the anus is. -I was abducted by aliens. God. And they didn't stick any probes in me, or, you know, hurt me or anything. -Yeah, I can see that. -They try to capture people down here to really see where the anus is. Now, I know for a fact that it's in their naval, is where the anus is. -I don't think anybody else in the band remembers this, but we did some-- we did a few really sold-out shows on other planets, in other galaxies. -I love aliens. -Now, you don't have to believe that. I don't really give a shit what you believe. I'm telling you what I saw, and not what I touched, understand that now. Let's get that quite clear. Just understand that. -Yeah. -What I saw, all right? Now, that's it. -Are you heavily medicated? I'm just-- -Ah, you want to know why they call me the Hammer? Would you like for me to demonstrate to you why they call me the Hammer? -I think we've got enough. Thank you very much. -My pleasure. -Good afternoon. This is Harris Crap with Worldview News. WFUK, Channel 69. I'm standing here talking with Brian Johnson, million-dollar winner of "Transvestite Survivor." So, Brian, how does it feel? -That's kind of a stupid question. I just won a million dollars. How do you think I feel? -Has it soured you that your show has slipped to number two in the wake of Al Manac's return? -No, I really don't care that the show is number two. I won my million, and that's all I care about. -Hi, I'm Al Manac. I'm here today with Butterfly and Stool. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm Stool. -So, Butterfly, why did you drag me out here on this beautiful Saturday afternoon? -Well, you see, a few days ago-- -So you'd have been in school. Do you feel that the educational system is preparing you for an equal opportunity future? -A few days ago, Stool and I was out back looking for Pa. -Looking for Pa. -And there was this big, bright light. -A bright, bright light. -It was a saucer. -Flying saucer. -And it just hovered there. And the strangest little critter you ever done see was wobbling about there yonder. -And what, you fed him some Reese's Pieces? You sat around, had a group hug, took some snapshots? Made him phone home? You know, tell your father I don't appreciate being dragged out here in the middle of the afternoon for some teenage prank. -No, but-- -Next time he decides to call me, I'm not coming out here. -We have it. -What? -The alien. We captured it. It's in our shed. -Oh. Oh. Um, I'm going to go check it out. Oh, my god. What is that? What the hell is that? -We call him Cowpie, because he looks like a-- -Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He looks like a-- -He? What makes you think it was a he? What the hell just happened here? He likes you. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, he likes you. -Aw, isn't that sweet. Well, we can't film in here right now. We've got to get release forms. Yes, that's it. Let's go. Come on, let's get some release forms. There you go. Out you go. Mack. Take these guys out to find their Pa and get release forms, would you? Thanks. Crap, shit, fuck. How, how, how, how, how? Oh, I'm getting back to you very soon, Cowpie. -Pa. Pa? Pa. Pa. Pa. Where are you, Pa? -Hmm. -Where are you, Pa? Pa, where are you? -Oh, this'll work just fine. Oh, this is going to hurt you a lot more than it's going to hurt me, Cowpie. And you know what? I'm fine with that. -Pa? Where are you, Pa? Pa! -Ah! Payback. Alien payback. Bitches should have stayed up in the sky where you belong. Ah, I'm enjoying this, Cowpie. -Pa? I found Pa! Pa, wake up, Pa. Wake up, Pa. Wake up. -Ha! My little Butterfly. Who are you? You touch my girl? -Pa, we need your signature to be on TV. Me and Stool going to be TB stars. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. TV stars. -Sir, if you could just sign this? -Touch my little girl, and you're going to have to marry her. -Pa, sign the release form, please? -OK. Let's see here. Sorry about that. There. There you go. -Oh, thanks Pa. I love you. -Stool. Get your ass over here. -Oh. I'm sorry. I can give you a few more minutes alone, if you want. -Nope. All ready. Mack, you ready? You set up? Yeah? OK. All right. Kids, come on in here. Kids, come on in here. All right. All right. We're going in three, two-- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Al Manac. This could be one of the most exciting stories in the history of mankind. These guys here with me are Butterfly and Stool, and they claim to have captured a life alien. Not just a photograph, not just some resemblance, but a live alien. So, without further ado, I give you Cowpie. So, Butterfly, tell me. How did this alien come into your care? -Well, um, you see, it was a few days ago, and-- -Wait a minute. Hold on a second. What? I couldn't see this before in the dark, but-- -What? -Wires. -What? -There's wires here! -What'd you do? -And a needle. Why is there a needle? -What did you do? Oh, my god. What did you do to Cowpie? Oh. Oh, Cowpie. Oh, you bastard. -I'm so sorry, ladies and gentlemen. Mack, just cut it. Hello, viewers. This is Al Manac. I'm here in West Virginia at the Black Crack Forest Preserve with Ruth and Bill Kramer, who have an interesting story to tell us. -My husband Bill and I, we were out hiking like we do most weekends. -Then this huge shadow fell over the entire area. This was an alien spacecraft. About the size of our mobile home. -No. -What do you mean, no? -Why would an alien spacecraft look like a mobile home? That's the most anti-aerodynamic shape imaginable. -I said it was the size of my mobile home, I didn't say it looked like my mobile home. -You did. You said it looked like a mobile home. -No, he didn't. -Technology in a mobile home really isn't that impressive. -It wasn't a mobile home. -It was a mobile home. -Well, what do you think? -Well, you look taller on TV. -Well, Al, they're not exactly the type of segments we would open a show with. -They're good. -Uh, yeah, very good. Although I think the fact that you're basically calling these people liars could work against us. -Al, our job here is to take small facts and embellish the hell out of them. -I remember. -Yes, but you've taken small facts and crushed them with your boot heel. -I don't wear boots. -It's a figure of speech, Al. -You know, maybe the problem is that these stories, they don't have enough bite. You know, enough substance to sink your teeth into. -Could be. -Hey, yo. Why don't we bring Al in on the McKenna interview. All right? That's the best piece of evidence we had in six months. -You don't mind sharing, do you, Ernest? -Oh, no. Not at all. I don't mind giving Old Boy some of my table scraps. -Picture this. We open the show with this message. Al Manac. He got beamed up, he got mixed up, he showed back up, so stand up, shut up, and look up, because those aliens are about to get fucked up. Something like that. -You can't say that on network television. -What, telling the audience to shut up? Too harsh? Maybe you're right. Damn. I wish we were on Showtime. -Hey. I got faith in you, bro. -Randall? Randall, what are you doing in there? Randall? What the hell is going on? Randall. This is your mother. I know what you're up to in there. Downloading internet porn. You know, the police can trace that stuff. I won't have them at my doorstep. Young man, you get out here and explain yourself right now. You disgusting, perverted little boy. -Do you believe in love at first sight? -Uh-huh. -Do you believe in destined soulmates? -I believe in mating. -Amen. -Perv! -It's not what you think! I'm the victim, here! -Mr. Porta? -No, sorry, you -Mr. Porta, I was just reading your book, and I was-- -Go way. Not interested. -No, but please, Mr. Porta, I just want to ask you a couple of questions. Mr. Porta, please, I won't take up much of your time. -What are you-- get out of here! Son, get out of here, does not mean, please come in and have a seat. -But Mr. Porta, please, I just want to ask you a few questions. -Rex. Call me Rex. -Oh. OK, Mr. Rex. Well, I was just-- Well, I was reading, and-- -Spit it out, son. It's your nickel. -Well, I read this book you wrote. -I assumed that. -Well, and I was wondering. Are there any spots that you left out? -Well, I mean, I'm really frightened of being abducted, and I'm terrified at the thought of them and their-- their instruments in my-- you know. -Yes, I do know. 6,969 times I know. That's how many times they-- oh, god, the little gray fucks. -Have you been-- did they get to you, too? -No. I've been trying to-- well, I mean, I've been trying to not get abducted. Well, after I read your book, I got really, really scared because, you know, I pass through a lot of the places that you list in your book, and-- and I know it's only a matter of time, but-- but I was wondering if there was any nasty places, like really nasty places, that-- that was a surefire way to get abducted that maybe you forgot to mention. Because I want to avoid it. I mean, I'd be petrified. I mean, that would be the worst. -No. No. There's not really a place like that. Of course, an abduction could really happen anywhere. I just listed the spots they gather from most frequently. -Could I be in danger just by being here? Are they watching us right now? -No, you're fine. It's been five years since they last abducted me. -Oh. Well, that's great. -You know, I don't believe you. You-- you want it, don't you. I mean, you actually want to have them abduct you and-- and have them put their-- in your-- Why, man? Why? -No, I don't, honest. I'm scared of that. I mean, terrified. Horrified. -No, I'm not sure I believe you. -Honest. I swear on my mother's soul. -OK. OK. I believe you. No need for that. -How have you avoided them for five years? You must have some special technique or method or way. -Oh, it's special, all right. After the last time I was abducted, after the 6,969th time I was abducted, one day, this guy shows up on my porch. You know, black glasses, black suit. You know. You know the type. And he-- he gave me this. You know what this is? This is a secret government device that helps to track the alien scanners. You know, the government-- our government-- knows about the abductions. Oh, yeah. They know all about them. They don't stop them, though, because they just like to get all the technology that they can pilfer from those little gray fucks. But one man. One man cared. One man saw my pain and said, enough. And he gave me this. And with this device, I've been able to stay one step ahead of the alien scanners. One step ahead for the last five years. -Say, you don't think that I could borrow that for one night, could I? -Oh, oh no, no. No, you-- you can't have this. How-- how could you even ask that, knowing what I've been through? -Just for one night. -No. -Please. -No. -Pretty please. -No. -Pretty please with sugar on top? -No, no, no. -I need it. I really, really, need it. -No. -It's just for one night. -I was right about you. You sick freak. Why, man? Why would you want them to do that to you? Do you have any idea what it's like to get probed? Don't worry about 6,000 times. The first time-- 6,000 times just makes it ugly. They got pointy things on the,. Little sharp things on them. Things that cut you up on the inside like you can't imagine. And when they're done with you, they send you back. They give you a little time to heal and then they grab you again. They give you just enough time to stop the bleeding every time you fart. It gouges. It cuts. It tears. Not only at your ass, it tears at your soul. I take it back. You're not a sick fuck. You're an insane bastard. Now-- [PHONE RINGING] -You found your way in. You can find your own fucking way out. Hello? No, no, I really can't talk right now. No, I don't know. I haven't seen him in days. The last time I knew, he was keeping his head down. Trying to avoid them. You know, like I am. Keeping an eye on his scanner and keeping a low profile. No, I can-- I can put out some calls on the network and see what I can find. -Goodbye! Thanks! [CAR STARTING] -This way. -Max, what kind of dump are you bringing me to? It looks like a laboratory for rats or something. -You get lonely in that box? -It's not the best time of my life, I can tell you that right now. -Sassy Lou, what happened there? -That's Joseph McKenna. -He's the victim of a botched abduction attempt. Seems that when the aliens were trying to beam him up, they, uh, they must have had some kind of malfunction. He's been like that for over six months. -Oh, Max. We're all set to go, so if you two could stand over there, we're ready to shoot. -Actually, I was thinking Al could take a crack at this. -You're Al Manac? I-- I thought you were abducted. -No, that was just a rumor-- -But the television said-- -He was mind wiped. Isn't it sad? -Those dirty freaks. -So, Al here knows what it's like to be at the mercy of these heartless creatures. You two could have a, uh, a moment of shared pain. Ratings gold. -You ready? -Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Al Manac. I'm here with Joseph McKenna, who has an amazing story. So, Mr. McKenna, tell us what happened. -There isn't really much to tell. I had just seen a movie. I was coming out of the theater. -And which theater was that? -Oh, the Deluxe 30. -Do you feel that the more screens a theater installs, the less personal service the customer gets? -Well, I guess. -Al, I think we've established what was important. He was coming out of the theater. He was in a public place. -That's true. So, were there any witnesses? If there were, I wouldn't know. I materialized a few seconds later in a nearby field and immediately started losing cohesion. I found my way to a phone and called the police, who then contacted the military, who put me here in this facility. The only thing that's keeping me from total disintegration is this machine. -So, Mr. McKenna, what movie did you see that night? -Al? Al, what does that have to do with anything? -That's OK. I haven't had a decent conversation in months. I saw-- oh, what was the name of that movie? -Who was in it? -Who the hell cares? -Uma Thurman was in it. -Did she really become a big star while I was gone? -Oh, yeah, she's great. I'd like to see her do more romantic stuff. -Oh, sort of like a romantic comedy kind of thing? -Ah, if it's done right, you know. -Oh, they're usually pretty forgettable. -Yeah, they're not very realistic. -What the fuck is going on here? This-- this interview? It's not about this guy's movie preferences. This is about hardcore investigative journalism. This is about the biggest story we have ever done in the history of the show. -Well, it could also be a personality piece. -Shut up, Al. We need the facts, OK? The facts. The fucking facts. All right? We can blow this alien conspiracy wide open. And I, I, can be on my yacht, rich. So let's try this again, shall we? -I've got to go to the bathroom. -Now? -Yeah, I'll be right back. -Well, we're not waiting for you. OK? Step in here, Ernest. -Sure. Sure, boss. Sure. -Let's show them how it's done, huh? -How do we look? Square here? All good? All set? So, ah, Mr. McKenna, speaking of going to the bathroom, how do you take care of business in that thing? What do you do? -Actually, I'm-- I'm going right now. -That's my boy. That's the way it's done, huh? -Thanks, boss. Thanks. -Yes, Albert? -We're in trouble. -How is that? -They've got the goods. Something on your end screwed up a teleportation, and now they have indisputable proof that you exist. Albert, you must invalidate this proof. That is a condition of your parole. -He's right out there. -That is not our concern. -Not your-- how? How can you say that? How can you just expect me to invalidate evidence like this? -You will find a way. -Yeah? Or what? -Let me share with you our new promotional video stream of our new line of super probes. -Oh, my god. -You will find a way, Albert. Otherwise, welcome back. -I'll find a way. -No, it doesn't hurt a lot. It's-- it's kind of, I don't know, kind of tingly. -Sort of like a first date, huh? -Mr. McKenna? Let us help you. Let us bring in a group of independent scientists to verify what you've told us. That way, you can help us bring down the alien scum that did this to you. -Maybe you're right. -Huh. You are a brave man, Mr. McKenna. -I can't do much, but-- maybe I can still make a difference. -This show will be behind you 100%. -I'm just glad I'm still alive. -What just happened? What is going-- Hello? The reception's bad. Mr. McKenna? Hello? Anybody in there? What the fuck happened? -I don't know, I don't know. He was-- he was just in there, and he's gone now. -Damn it! Damn it! -All right. I'm ready. Let's do this thing. -We can't do anything. Mr. McKenna? Gone. -Darn. -Oh, this is unbelievable. -I wonder how that could have happened. -Yeah, you know, I wonder. How did that happen? -Damn it, damn it, damn it! [SHOUTING] -Hey, can I get some service? I know what I want. I want the biggest sandwich you can make me, pronto. -OK, there's your sandwich, pronto. -Oh, no. -Chris. How you doing? -Good. -Chris. Chris. No, Chris, I need jelly beans. You're a good man, Chris. And you know what? I hear the sandwiches are good. Hey, guy. Don't panic. Just give me the, ah-- Hey, I'm talking to you. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, it's my buddy. It's my pal! It's Al Manac the maniac! Look! I just want to tell you something, buddy. You're back, man. I've been watching you. You're back on top. You know, I tell all my friends, I said I know that pussy ass, wuss, dog-breath, farthead, douchebag buddy of mine. He's my buddy. -Yeah, nice to see you, too. -Hey, look. Ah, I'd like to stay around and catch up with you, but I'm kind of in a hurry, if you know what I mean? -I thought we were friends. -But we are friends. That's what friends are for. And you know what? That's what you're my friend. And you know what? I'm going to thank you kindly-- -Why aren't you robbing him? -You can't tell that's a cop? What the hell's the matter with you? I ain't going to do anything with him. -Why aren't you arresting him? Hello? -I'm off duty. -You know, there is one more thing. Greed is good, but so is the stomach. And if you don't mind. You ought to try one of these. They're really good. And you know what, Al? Good luck with you and your career. I'll be seeing you. Thanks a lot, buddy. -Fucking typical. -Wow, where did you get that thing? -It's not a pipe. It's an alien probe. -Really? A genuine alien anal exploration device? -Yeah, I-- I'm not lying. It's like nothing you've ever seen before. You should go ahead and touch it. It's like nothing you've ever felt before. -Wow. You're right. I-- I've never felt anything like that before. -You believe me, then? -Absolutely. The texture is out of this world. -See, I told you so. It's about time somebody believed me. -Holy crap. It's still active. -Don't I know it. It seems like the damn Energizer Bunny. It keeps going, and going. -You don't want it? -What? Hell, no. And you can let go now, by the way. -Well, I can help you out. If you don't want it, I'd be glad to-- -Yeow! If I could have got that thing out of me, I would have done so weeks ago. But the damn thing's still got its tendrils all up in me, -Well, I've got some scissors in the car. I'd be happy to get them for you. -No. No. Come on. -Can I touch it again? -No. I'm done. -Please? -No. -Just one more time. -No. -I don't think I believe you. That's really a pipe, isn't it? -Yeah, nice try. It's not going to work. -Oh, come on. Let me touch it. -It's not going to work. Let me touch it. -It's not going to work. -It's not going to work. -One more time. -It's not going to work. -One more time. -No. -Come on, please? -Come on, no. -Still nothing? -Nada. Ahh. Wait, finally! There's one we can-- Oh! -Oh, god. Mind wipe failure! -Oh, not him again. Move the ship to Quadrant 69. Well, that settles that. The chances of running across that disgusting, disturbed human again are astronomically large. A googolplex or some such. So, tell me. What do you see? What new victim shall we plunder asunder? -I've got one! I've got-- It can't be. -I'm losing my appetite. Sleep period. -Oh, don't give up, Captain, don't-- [YAWN] -I'm awfully tired. -You know, I should be doing this interview. I've paid my dues. -Trust me, Ernest, you don't want to be anywhere near this one. -This could be a historical moment. -Yeah, looks like my luck is finally rubbing off on the show again. -Th-- that's ridiculous. -Yeah, we'll see. -Senator Hardly, I just wanted to express once more my admiration for you, sir. And I think it's so important that someone in the government is taking a stand against these creatures. -This great country of ours deserves a fighting chance. If the aliens invade, and we all die tomorrow, I just want to go on record as being against it. -A bold, bold stance, Senator. And quite a scoop for our show, as well. -Do not touch the senator. -It's OK, boys. Stand down. -Yes, sir. -I, ah, I didn't know. -My security force and I are a little touchy since I've taken this opportunity to announce my plans to run for the presidency. -Wow, that's another huge scoop for our show as well. -Let me clarify. We're not touchy, we're concerned. We have, in fact, never touched each other in a way that might be construed as appropriate. -I see. -You can't be too careful with today's sound-bite media. -That's true. Let me introduce you to Christy. All right. Oh, Christy. This is Senator-- -Sherman? -Ah, Christine. -Sherman, what are you doing here? -I'm here to say whatever helps me get votes. -You two know each other? -Yeah, Sherman used to own a club that I stripped in. -Ah. -I deny that allegation. -Ah, have a seat over here. We'll get you set up. That'll be your seat, right here. -What? What are you doing? -Goodness. -Call off your boys, Senator. -What have you gotten us into? -It's all right. It's all right. Listen, we'll use the boom, OK? Yeah. Just bring it in. There you go. Just bring it down a little closer. -Ah! I've been hit! -Cover the senator! Everyone-- -I didn't say anything to your wife. -No, it's all right-- -That's it. We're leaving. -We'll just re-ass your chair. It's fine. OK? -No scoop for you. -Oh, come on. Come on. Let's not leave mad. Folks, come on-- people. -Bastard. -No, wait! One more! Wait! Wait! You can't take just one! -So you claim to have seen spaceships? -Not seen, am seeing. -Weather balloons. Oh, my god, and check this out. -Bullshit! -Kentucky Bluegrass. This is amazing stuff. Oh, my god. And furthermore, look at these $2,000 shoes. They're something else. You don't know what I had to go through to get these puppies. Nice, huh? -May I help you? -Oh, yes. I'd like to apply for a job on your show, which I just love, by the way. I'd like to be a cameraman, even though I know there's a slight risk of being, you know. -Right. So you have a lot of experience being the camera? -Oh, well, no. But I have read this book, and I'm very enthusiastic. -Peachy. Well, why don't you leave your resume, go home, and I'll call you as soon as we have an opening. How about that, huh? -Oh, great. Super. Oh, thanks a lot. You won't regret it. I'm just going to go home, and I'm going to wait right by the phone. OK. -All right. That's great. -Yeah, there was a spaceship and it crashed over there in that field. I went over to the crash site. There was a lot of debris, and that's where I found this gun. I tell you what, hunting's never been the same. And my neighbor, he hasn't given me crap anymore, man. -What, do think that that's an alien ray gun? It's simply a cheapass toy, man. Look at it. -Hey, be careful with that-- -Mmm, yeah I know. Do you believe it? That cheating son of a bitch. I heard he was a Mexican and gave him crabs. -Mom, please, hang up! -Randall, please. Your mother is on the phone with Aunt Petunia. -Max Harmon's going to call, I'm going to-- -I'm sorry, Tuney, I don't know what gets into that son of mine. Randall! To think that once in a spasm of motherly generosity that I fed you from these very breasts of my own! You unholy terror! You know what's coming now! -No, please, Mom, you have to stay off the phone. I'm going to get a call and I'm going to be a big TV reporter, and I'm going to get abducted just like Al Manac. -No one's going to call you. No one's coming here. Get your behind over here right now. -No. You can't make me. -No, Randy, Randall-- oh oh, my heart! Oh! The doctor said you would do it, and now you've gone and done it. -Mama? -You've killed your mother. Oh, my heart. -Mama? Mama? Are you OK? Mama, are you all right? Please, Mama! -Gotcha. -No, Mama, look at the phone. No, please! -Hello, Petu-- -Barb, what's happening? Oh my god, I was so scared. -"Search for Intelligent Life"? Mr. Randall Bottom? I'm sorry, he's not here right now. -I'm right here! -He said he'd never work on a cut-rate show like yours. No, not Mr. Showbusinesses. He's upstairs right now shaving his legs and dolling up pretty to be an audition for "Transvestite Survivor" right now. -Mama, no. -You don't call us. We'll call you. -No, please, Mama, no. -Sir. I'm receiving a code alpha. -Detatched probe? That one has something that belongs to us. -You think we should make an example out of him? -Yes. Let's. Give him the ultra-mega-super treatment. -Really? You think we should go that far? The ultra-mega-super treatment? -Absolutely. I despise escapees. They vex me. -Oh, boy, oh, boy. -Ahhh! -Sir, you're never going to believe this one. -Another butt plug? Do they think this will stop us? Will they never learn? -Oh, he's about to learn, sir. He's going to learn the hard way. -Prepare special treatment. Butt plug. -No, no, no! -Well, well, well. Look who we have here. -I miss him. He's my favorite. Prepare the super-- -Wait. We've had him 6,969 times, you know. There's just something magical about that number. I'm almost tempted to leave him alone. Almost. Prepare the anal probe. -They say you can never go home, but they're wrong. -We just chalked this one up as just another nut job. -Cut it right there. -I don't like it right there. -No, it's fine. It looks good right there. -The audio keeps jumping in. There's no exit point. -Just do it, OK? Thank you. Just-- just cut it. -All right. What have we got going here? -Get that piece done? Yeah, it's coming along great. -Can I take a look at it? -No, I've got to go over some location permits. Let me talk to you in your office for a second here. -All right. You know what? I'm going to go get some coffee. Why don't you go ahead to the office? -Well, actually-- -Do you want to come? -Sure, I'll just-- -Oh, hey, hey, I'll tell you what. I'll get it for you. You go ahead, OK? There you go. What do you take, a couple creams? -Ugh. This asshole. -Hey, Duke. Keep that ending in there. Every second of it. Love you, babe. Don't go changing. -Where's my coffee? -Fuck your coffee. -Where did you just go? You went back and changed the piece, didn't you? You can't change the piece. I debugged the guy. It's a total fake. -You've been doing a lot of that debunking lately, haven't you? -Well, uh-- -What the fuck is wrong with you? Look, I never really liked you in the first place, but at least I knew we were on the same page. Now, I'm not even sure we're on the same planet. I'm not even sure you are really you. It's like Al has been replaced by a Bizarro Al. I almost hope that you are some alien duplicate, because if you're all that's left of the Al I used to know, that would make you even more pitiful than you were in the first place. -Look, I'm just trying to reach through the-- -Don't. Don't. Stop. OK? Don't. Bottom line? Shape up, or ship out. -Yeah, but you-- -Out. Out. Out! -Hello? Are you in there? Are you in there? Hello? [TOILET FLUSHING] -We hear you, Albert. We always hear you, and we always see you. And we're not happy with what we've seen. Not happy at all. -We should take him now. -Woah, woah, woah. It's not my fault. It's not my fault. Things just ain't working out. I mean, there's no way to disprove you guys. You aliens are just too sloppy. -Albert, nothing has changed. -Prepare the transporter! -We are not interested in excuses, just results. I'm of half a mind to take you right now. -Yes, finally! -Fine. I don't care anymore. Why don't you just take me? Let's just get this over with. -Not quite yet. -Oh! Power down the transporter. -It is my understanding that people in your industry possess something called creativity. You had best be creative, Albert. And be creative soon. -Well, hey, buddy! -Oh, um, hi. -Randy? Randy Bottom? -What are you doing here, Randy? -Oh, I'm here to get a job. I'm going to work on the show, even though I know I might be, you know, abducted and violated by strange alien devices. Max said he's going to call me. -Ooh, the kiss of death. -That's what Max tells everyone has no intention of hiring. But you know, Randy, I could help you get a leg up here, if you want it. -Oh, yes, of course, very. -You know, I got a top-secret shoot tonight. Yeah, I could really use your help. But you can't say a word to anyone until it airs. You promise? -Promise. I swear I won't tell anybody. And if I do, you can abduct me and violate me and have your way with me yourself. -A simple yes would have sufficed. Hey, listen, do you know how to work that thing? -Oh, sure. I read this book. I know everything about it. -All right. Well, listen. Come on. Come with me. Now, here's what we got to do. Come here. Hang out here for a minute. I'll be right back. -Yes, sir. Sure hope those aliens don't come and take me while I'm waiting here. All alone. Completely defenseless. Hmm. -Hey, buddy. Buddy, wake up. Come here. -What? Woah! Dude, you can't wake up a vet like that. They may shoot innocent bystanders. -Oh, I don't know about that. Listen. I need you to do me a favor tonight. You're the only person I know outside of work. It's very, very important. It would mean a lot to me. Can you help me out? -I guess I could find a way to help a friend in need. -Really? Yes. Thank you. I really appreciate this. -But first you gotta do something for me. -Oh, shit. -Oh, god. Oh. Oh, god. -Oh, that's it. You got skills. You got skills. -I gotta get out of here. I gotta go back to work. -What are you talking about? There's lots of time. Come on, harder, harder. Tell me a story. -What? What kind of story? -I don't know, you stupid asshole. Just a story. How about a wicked witch? Yeah. A wicked witch. Who doesn't like fat kids. She hates fat kids. -All right, all right, all right. There was a wicked witched named Helga. -Yeah? Did she hate fat kids? -Yeah, she hated your fucking fat kids. -Oh. -Sir, are there going to be any aliens on this shoot? -Most likely. -Well, what would you say our chances are of actually being abducted? We-- we couldn't really be abducted, could we? I mean, I would really hate that if we were abducted and they stuck a probe up my butt. -Any chance of you shutting up? -Oh, sorry. I was just trying to assess the danger factor. Yeah, because, I mean, I would really hate that if, like, they were going to abduct me and stuck a probe up my righteous rectum. I would really, really, really, really hate that. I can't stand the thought. Is this it? Are we here? They're here, aren't they? They're going to take us and use us for their own pleasure. -You know how to operate that thing, right? -Well, yeah, sure, I mean, I have this book. -Start rolling. They're here. -OK. I'm going to finally see some aliens. All right. -Hello. You all know me. I'm Al Manac, and I've stumbled across something that's going to change all of our lives forever. Hey, thanks, man. -You know, you shouldn't have done that. It wasn't very nice. -That's showbiz. [VOICES TALKING SOFTLY] -He's a fucking dinosaur. He needs to go the way of the dinosaurs. -I have to admit it. It was better when he was missing. -He's not with the program. Yeah, I know you all think he's this great legend, but he's not. -I can't just fire him. I got it. This is-- this is so beautiful, I can't believe I didn't think of this before. Resurrected reporter, a fake alien duplicate. -Brilliant. -Brilliant? -I like it. -All right. Come on. Let's go to my office, take a look. Where is that guy for the pickup? -Haven't seen him. -Yep. That's going to work. -Yes, it will. As long as we can get it done, it's not a-- Why is this fucking tape still sitting here? -I don't know. -Oh, there he is. The station pickup. You're a little late, buddy. There's the tape. Don't let us put you out. No, you-- you take your time, OK? -What the fuck was that all about? -I don't know. Little pissant. Fire those guys. -Hold on. We've got to switch tapes. Ah, you have the wrong one. Here you go. -You sure? -Yeah, I'm sure. Here you go. Give me that one. OK. Thanks. Have a good day. -Ahh. I have died and gone to heaven. It's going to be quite a night, isn't it? -Mm-hmm. -Absolutely. -Oh, yeah. -God, I love my life. -Mr. Bottom. what's going on with the show? -Wait, I-- I know that guy. I-- -The show is fine. The show is fine. Just a few speed bumps we've hit along the way. In fact, I was just telling Max Harmon the other day about the new direction I'll be taking the show. -Did he just say Max Harmon? -Yeah. -Has the management changed? Has Mr. Harmon been demoted? -No. Max Harmon is still the executive producer. -Oh, very nice of you. -It's just that I'm the new supreme executive producer. -Did he just say he was the supreme executive producer of my show? -Yeah. -Had Al Manac been given his walking papers? Has he had a psychotic break? -No, no, no no. -That is the little freak from the hallway. I recognize that guy now. -But I have a message for those bastard aliens. -Oh, wait'll I get my hands on him. Oh, man. -Get your hands on him. -That burns me up. -You want to blame somebody for rallying humanity against you? Blame me. -Un-fucking-believable. -Go ahead, blame me. Ah. This is the show that I produce. -Oh, OK. -Yeah. "The Search for Intelligent Life." -Mmm. -Now, let me tell you, there's not much out there. -You're funny. -Ah, you're just saying that. I mean, because it's true. -Hello. You all know me. I'm Al Manac. -Wait a minute. I did not approve this-- this segment right here. -Forever. -Heads are going to roll. Let me tell you, heads are going to roll. -I've gotten word of a massive alien invasion hell-bent on world domination. The world as we know it will be over in less than 24 hours. -Oh, I see. I see. He's good. He's good. -I'm going to give him a raise. -Right here, right now. -Ooh, a raise? -I hear something. Oh my god, it's the first alien soldier. -He's very clever. -Mr. Alien. -Very clever. -Can I interview you? Mr. Alien? -What? Oh, no. -I'm sorry, Al. Let's try it again. -That son of a bitch. Un-fucking-believable. -I think I got a tick. Oh, I can't get him off. Help me get him off. -What? He's fake? He's a fake? This is all a set-up? -Put the camera up. Keep it rolling. Let's go. Come on. -Yes. He's fake. -Oh, that's it. That's it. Party's over. -He's not real. -Time to go. Time to go. Bye-bye. Hit the road. Hit the road. -You are such a jerk. -Yeah, and? -I've been living for the last two years in the Caribbean, soaking up the sun and drinking margaritas-- -Oh, Al. What have you done? ---while the show played out my fake abduction. -What have you done? -I can't do it anymore. -Oh, we are fucked. -I can't live a lie. I just can't. -We are so fucked. -That's not the only things we've fabricated on the show. -Fuck, fuck, fuck! -We fabricated just about everything. All the aliens, all the UFO stuff. There's nothing that's real on the show. Nothing at all. -No, no, no. I can spin this. -It's all been a fake. -Yeah, I-- -It's all a lie. -I can-- -There are no aliens. There never has been. There never has been. -No problem. -It just isn't right. He shouldn't have lied to everybody like that. This is goodbye, Ma. -Goodbye. Finally moving out, are you? -I've got something I've got to do. -I'll believe that when I see it. -I probably won't be back. Take care of yourself. -Take care of myself. I guess I'll have to. Can't count on you for any god damn thing. Rotten kid. I swear to god. -Would you stop that? Would you wipe that shit-eating grin off your fucking face? I suppose you're happy, huh? You're happy that you no longer have a job? But you. You weren't satisfied with just losing your own job. You had to make sure that everyone in the studio lost their job as well. Because that's what you've done, you know. You've done what all those years of inept reporting and half-baked subjects never did. You've killed the show. You have killed the search for intelligent life. And you know what the funniest thing is? Huh? Do you know? You're the one who lied. We have been legit for almost two years now, and you-- you washed it all down the drain in no time at all. Get out of my sight. Oh, one more thing, Al? You're fired. -Oooh, I'm fired from a cancelled show! I'm quaking in my boots! Woo! -Out, out, out. Oh, you'll never work in this town again. No, sir. I'll see to it. That son of a bitch. I don't know what I was thinking. -Hello? Hello? Anybody there? -Hello, Albert. I must say, we're very pleased. -And very surprised. -We didn't think you had a chance in hell of accomplishing your directive. -I know that. I know you guys were setting me up to fail. But I did it. I accomplished your mission. So this is my last report. I'm done with you guys. -You did accomplish your directive. And you did so much better than we could have envisioned! Good job, Albert. Good job. -Thank you. Fuck you. Goodbye. -Prepare the transport. -What? -Yes! Finally! -No, no, no, no. You can't do that. -Prepare the transport. -I accomplished your directive. You acknowledged that yourself. -Yes, I did acknowledge that, Albert. There is no question you accomplished your directive. -You promised, you promised, you promised I'd be free if I debunked you all. -We lied, Albert. We lied. -Transport initialization in three minutes. -See you soon, Albert. -Fuck, fuck, fuck! Aaah! -You lied to us all. That wasn't very nice. -Look, man, I didn't lie. -Yes you did. -The aliens are real. That shoot that we did was the lie. -See? You lied. -I'm not lying now. -About the aliens being fake or real? I'm confused. -Look, you want to be abducted, right? Your life's goal is to be probed. Do you see what I have in my hand? -Not really. -This is a genuine alien tracking device. Whosever in possession of this thing in the next few minutes will be treated to a plethora of probing. Here. Knock yourself out. -Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Oh, I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry I doubted you-- -Fuck me! -No! No. It was supposed to be me! It was supposed to be me! Come back! Take me! Please! Just one more-- please--
