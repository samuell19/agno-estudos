[MUSIC PLAYING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [YELLING] No use feeling sorry for the buggers, Charlie. If you do, you end up like our friend here. Dead. [WHISTLING] What are you doing? I'm sorry, sir. Don't take the barrel off-- [CHATTER] How are you, sir? Great. Thanks so much. Three things. How so? You want to stay in the game, eh, Sarge. Nah. I think I'll take Charlie over a cup of tea. Always like to quit while you're ahead, Sarge. Eh, you know me, Smithy. See you later. I'm sorry, Sarge. Forget it, Charlie. It ain't over yet. I really buggered the help. It's a long way to Paris, Charlie. And it's even further to Berlin. It's a job to be done, Charlie. The less feelings you have, the better it's done. Fancy a game of cards? Nah. No thanks. Come on. Let's get out of here. [BELLS TOLLING] Catholic are you, Charlie? Nah. Hey, hey, Charlie, come here. Betty Grable there. Eeee, those legs. When's the last time you had it off, Charlie? What? When was the last time you had it off? [CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY] It's quite milking country there, Sarge. Oh, yeah. They're the only kind of tits you're interested in, Charlie? What do you think, Sarge? Let's have a look. Hello, love. Whoops! Um, parlez-vous anglais? English? Yeah. Don't be frightened it's-- it's OK. We're friends. We just-- we just come for some water, just to drink of water. It's good. It's from the ground, not too high. I come from countryside like this myself. Hey, there's no need to be frightened. We're friends. Friends! OK? You are welcome for the water. Hey, come on, love. We're just getting to know each other. Ah, very nice. Aren't you going to invite us in for a bit? [SPEAKING FRENCH] Christ. They yours? What do you want? We came to arrest the woman. Oh, yeah? Police are you? No. I am of the resistance. I have orders to take her. - What's she done? [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Sergeant, we have no quarrel with you. You are our friends. This woman is an enemy to France. She's French, isn't she? A traitor. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] She's a friend of the Germans. [SPEAKING FRENCH] So what are you going to do with her? [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] You, put that gun down. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Huh? Not true. OK, you stay here. I'm going to have a little chat. Any monkey business, you know what to do. What do you want? Look, I'm not going to hurt you, OK. Seems to me that you've got a bit of a problem here. I just might be able to help you out. Hmm? What happens if I just turn around and walk away? Hey? Seems to me like you've got yourself a bit of a problem. Now my unit's rested, so we won't be moved until Monday. That's three days. Maybe I can hang around here for a bit. You know, help you out. You will stop them? Oh, yeah. Alone? Yeah. They're not soldiers, you know. They're amateurs. Civvies. May I have one? Oh, sure. Yeah. You should go. The longer you make them wait, the worse it will be. If I stay here for the weekend, they might just go away. There is not much food. Food. No. Got a couple of jobs for you, Charlie, my boy. Oh, but Sarge-- Want you to go back to the cook house, get me a sackful or rations, you know, for two 'til Monday. Get me some shaving gear and a towel. And ask Smith for some, you know, some French letters. French letters. French letters. Letters, you burk. You know, what you put on your prick. Oh, right. Yeah. And tell Mortimer I'm doing a solo rec. I'll see him on Monday. You got all that? Ah, yeah, towel, shaving gear, Russians-- yeah, um-- - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And tell Mortimer. Right. [GUNSHOTS] Jesus, Sarge! Off you go, Charlie. Now listen here, you lot. I'm staying here, so you might as well just trot off. We will wait. What's she done that's so bloody terrible, eh? She's a friend of the Germans. If she makes love to them, well, these are women would shave their head for the shame. But this one had friends in the resistance, and she told a German officer. 12 men dead. My good son, his father. Yeah, well, that's not what she says. Sergeant, it has been a very long war for us. What do you think I've been doing, mate? Sitting on be bloody ass? I've been fighting your war for you. We are grateful for your help, but now we must solve our problems in our own way. [SPEAKING FRENCH] No. What's he talking about? He doesn't understand your language. I'm staying, Billy Boy, so you can fuck off. Do you understand that? Very well. If you want this [SPEAKING FRENCH],, you shall have her. But we will wait. And when you go, we'll take her and make justice. [SNIFFS] [COCKS GUN] So off. [SINGING] You, uh, you live here alone do you? Yeah. Yeah. It's a very nice house. Very nice. It's quite milking country this, isn't it? You, uh, you do speak the English? A little. Yeah, well, I better go and check on these blokes out here. Look. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Sarge. Got everything in there, have you? Aye. Geez, so you got company. Yeah. Did you, uh, did you get the, um, you know? Where is your woman? Never you mind, you cheeky bugger. Go on. See you when I see you then. Yeah. I'll see you, Charlie. You, uh, you wouldn't have a beer would you? Too bad. I'd love a beer. Calvados, right? Come on. Do you good. Get a bit of, you know, get a bit of a glow off. Get a bit tipsy, eh. I'm not so fond of Calvados. No? That's like an Irishman not liking spuds. Eh? Excuse me. Jesus Christ. What's that? Coffee. Coffee? Don't taste like coffee to me. It's made from acorns. There is a war on you know. Oh, really? Do you, uh, you need a hand with the dishes? If you want. OK. It's been a long time for me, you know. You know what I mean? It's no bloody good. You'll have to do better than that. [HEAVY BREATHING] Don't! [YELLING IN FRENCH] I don't want no tarts! [SPEAKING FRENCH]. You shouldn't have done that. I've never held a tart! Never! You think I'm a prostitute don't you? That was what you wanted. You want to use me like a chamber pot, huh? [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SIGHS HEAVILY] Everyone wants something of me. I just don't want no frills. That's all. You're just another man who takes me because I cannot run away from you nor from them. I'm sorry. That's for the, uh-- [PLANE ENGINE] [ISABELLE SCREAMING] [YELLING IN FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Bollocks to you and your justice, mate. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Hey. It's all right. It's-- it's all right. They won't get you while I'm here. It's OK. I gotta make breakfast. Oh, you never told me your name. You never asked. I just asked you your name, that's all. Isabelle. Isabelle Pardu. Friends call me Belle. You didn't ask me my name. Well, since you're so interested, I'll tell you. It's Saul. Saul Scalby. So you're not married. No. I-- I never got around to it really. And you? No. Belle means beautiful doesn't it? What do you care? You want a woman in bed, does it matter the name or the face? Where I come from we say, you don't look at the mantelpiece when you're stoking the fire. It's ready. Listen, I-- Eat your food. I will say this much. You froggies sure know how to cook. Oh, thank you. It's because all men are selfish pigs. They shouldn't marry their cooks. I thought French men were supposed to be real romantic, you know like Charles Boyer. Take me to the casbah, my darling. Eh? The Frenchman expects to maybe a rich wife and then make her a servant, a good housekeeper. And what about in bed? I, like a servant, [SPEAKING FRENCH].. Is that why you took up with the Germans? You don't know what it was like. In 1940, it was not like now. When the Germans came in after Vichy, everybody was ready to try to live with them. There was no resistance then. We were sick of the war. You English have forgotten what it is like to be defeated. Not just this time but the first time as well. I thought we won the last war. I grew up with the men who won that war, men who just wanted to be safe. [SPEAKING FRENCH] you know? It was built by defeated men, and we hid behind it because we were afraid. We were beaten 20 years before this even started. [BOMB EXPLODES] All my childhood, it was like that-- shame, anger, fear. [BOMB EXPLODES] You see they are not beaten yet. [KNOCKING] Like toys. [MARCHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINES ROAR] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Bonjour. Bonjour. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] BELLE: And I could see people beginning to smile again. And I was smiling, too. OK, excuse me. [SPEAKING FRENCH] (SINGING) Happy days are here again, and the sky is clear and blue again. [SINGING NOTES] Happy days are here again! (SPEAKING) Did you like that? Not particularly. Hi. Take better care of you than this guy, sweetie pie. I didn't know we were so far from the action. Hey, pal, I almost lost my ass at Omaha Beach. Ain't see any of you Limeys there. Yeah, so what do you want? I'm here to liberate you. I'm with the Liaison Task Force here. I can get your kind of good supplies, use of transport. A person like yourself needs connections. Unfortunately, it all depends on who you know. She's not interested. And why don't you push off? Who is this guy? You can decide this for yourself. It's your house isn't it? It's your country. Suppose I do not want either of you. Hey, with all due respect, this is no place for a great looking dame like yourself. You need somebody to take care of you, honey. You need protection. With all the types hanging around here. You know something, mate, I'd say you're in deep shit. Oh, yeah? Yeah. That's funny. I feel OK. As a matter of fact, I feel just fine. Friends of yours? Yeah. And there's another one in the trees with a barrel aimed at your balls. One false move and you'll never get it up again. How's it going? I can make this worth your while. [SPEAKING FRENCH] What'd I say? Looks like you struck out, buddy. They're so moody. Prettier they are, the moodier they get. OK, pal, you win. There'll be another time. I can come back. Hey, keep your ass tucked in. Viva la France! You make me a put down to be sold and bought. You should put up a red lamp at the door. Look it didn't get you with his money did he? I'm like a bowl, and you are the big dog that gets the bowl. Well, don't forget those blokes out there either. Until when Monday, Tuesday? What do they want, eh? Who are they? They were sent from home to find me. Who are they? The old man, he's a teacher at the lycee. The big one was a porter there. And the kid? I don't know him. [BELL TOLLING] [SIGHS HEAVILY] What are you doing? I don't know how you can pray when all this is going on. Especially because of that. That doesn't stop my belief in God. This one is blocked. Everything in France is like that. Nothing works anymore. There's your dinner. Take off your shirt. I will dry it. Come on. Your hair is wet. It is nothing. You never told me about your family. My mother died when I was younger. And your dad? I killed him. Eh? [PIANO PLAYING] When the government left Paris for Vichy, some people, old people like my father, who chose to desert their posts. Poor papa. [INAUDIBLE] for farm machinery at his post. We were asked [INAUDIBLE]. What's wrong, papa? Everything. The war is over for us, papa. Are you so sure? Sometimes I hope you are right. Do you know what it is like for a man to be torn between his daughter and his honor? I know about your German pilot. I love him, papa. How can you love someone like that? You're the enemy. Yes, I know. We are at war with them, Belle. War. Take your coffee. I once prayed that when you grow up you would find the happiness that your mother and I found. I don't believe my prayer was heard. [CAR ENGINE] Oh, papa. He died of my shame. I miss him so. You've got remember the happy times, you know. I never knew my father. He was-- so what about this airman? What was his name? - Gustav. He went missing over England. He was like the son of Apollo. He, too, fell out of the sky. [KNOCKING] Yeah. CHARLIE: Hello, Sarge. Is it all right to come in? You know something, Charlie? Your timing's bloody immaculate. Well, what's up? Oh, we're moving on Monday for sure. Who told you. Well, the word is there's a big push on. I got it from the cooks at DVHQ. Which reminds me, here you go. Charlie, I want you to do something for me. I want you to stay here and look after the shop. I just want to take her ladyship for a walk, you know. Let her get some fresh air. Sure, Sarge, that's OK. Don't worry about it. It's OK. I won't have any trouble with the Frenches. I said hello as I came pass them. Slipped them a ten of bully beef and some chocolate. You're a bloody beaut, Charlie. That's all right, Sarge. Don't mention it. [KNOCKING] Belle. Get your coat on. We're going for a walk. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Where are we going? Going to find you a sanctuary. A safe place. Where? You'll see. Come on. There's no sanctuary here. You're not Catholic are you? You don't understand. [BELL TOLLING] You are a fool to bring me here. It's a church. It is terrible, even for a church. Tell him we want to see the boss, the head man. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Oui, oui. [FAINT SINGING] We shouldn't have come here. It's cold, dead. Listen, it's worth a go. All right. Mademoiselle, Sergeant. How can I help you? Are you-- are you in charge here? I'm the father superior. However, I should say since the liberation, I've been recalled. In my country, like yours, priests are not exempt from conscription. So are you like a chaplain then? Please. I'm captain of artillery. Captain of artillery and you're a priest as well? Christ was a fan of soldiers. He loved the faith and discipline and sense of being soldiers. Joan of Arc. Hmm. Lately. She was a hero of France. You are from war. Oui. When I was a child, they took me to see that prison where they kept her before she was taken and burnt. The bishops handed her over. French collaborators. Just as today. We have been under great oppression. Oppression. Oppression exactly. Imagine, Sergeant, for five years, we have had fear for our families, our friends. God forgives weakness, but it's another thing for someone who betrays. I know your name, mademoiselle. I know your name, your family. I know why those men are here to seek you. You are wrong, father. I didn't betray. Look. I didn't come here to get her off or anything. You know, I just-- I just want her to have a fair trial. Those blokes out there are a death squad. What about forgiveness, eh? What about casting the first stone? What about the woman taken in adultery? What about all that? What about the [SPEAKING FRENCH]?? The what? [SPEAKING FRENCH] It was a cell of the resistance in the war. You are accused of betraying those men. Father, please. I swear-- We know what was where and when. We have careful reports. And more than reports. They are staunch people, the Germans. They're methodical butchers. One of them was from the village. They sent back the body for the burial. It was in a sealed coffin. Forbidden fruit to open. We opened it here in the cellar, the yeomen. The young man, he had been tortured. 12 men died like this. Father, please believe me. I didn't betray them. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Listen, I came in to ask for her safety. This is a church. I didn't come here to ask for her to be let off or anything. I just want her to be tried according to the law that's all. She has been tried and judged. The sentence will be carried out. But you are a priest. You're supposed to be a man of God. I don't speak as a priest. I speak as a soldier. Oh, yeah. Well, you will have her blood on your hand. Sergeant, have you not killed? Yes, I have. In war, against men. I hope you carry the guilt of this all your life. To be a soldier is to have guilt, to carry guilt for others all our lives. [SPEAKING FRENCH] SAUL: What's he saying? He asks me if I wish to take confession. Because I forgot to say my hail Marys. I'm sorry, Father, but I didn't betray them. Yeah, I fell in love with a German, but my sin is innocence. I didn't know that in a war, it's a crime to love the enemy and not a crime to kill him. Come on. [THUNDER ROLLS] SAUL: Bloody doings. And they call themselves Christians. Come on, girl, cheer up. I said I'd look after you. And I will. The church cannot save me. You think you can? Course I will. Belle, I want you to tell me the truth about the-- about the [INAUDIBLE]. After Gustav had gone and my father died, I didn't go out for many months. Then I met a wonderful French boy. Balthazar. [ENGINE ROARING] Balthazar. [SPEAKING GERMAN] Balthazar. Balthazar. [GIGGLING] Bonsiour. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Belle. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Bonjour. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SCREAMING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Have you had German friends? What do you mean? A German lover? Yes. Balthazar, he's gone. It's over. No, it is not that. It is not for myself. If it was up to me alone-- Well, then. What's it? Huh? Forget me. Forget this place. Everything. Because I was in love with another man? Because you were in love with a German. A man, no less. A man whose love I could trust. An enemy of France. A man. Your choice, Belle. I'm sorry. [HORN HONKS] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] You know something, Charlie. Someday you're going to make somebody a terrific little wife. Terrific. I could only find powdered milk. Charlie here is an expert in milk, you know. Are you a farmer, Charlie? No. Milkman. Back home I was. What a hard life. Oh, no. It's not so bad except in winter perhaps. Mind you, it used to be harder. When I was a kid, I used to hang around with me old man. He was a milkman, too. On the old horse drawn floats, you know, ladling out the milk from the big churns with the brass fittings in them. But they stopped all that. Said it was an hygienic, but it wasn't. We used to scrub them churns clean every night until you could see your face in it. Guess it's in the blood, eh. Home is such a long way away isn't it? [PLAYING HARMONICA] [SINGING] (SINGING) Oh, me. Oh, my. He's just like George Formby, isn't he? You know who George Formby is? He's a singer, and he goes on-- Ukulele. Ukulele. Eh, she don't know who he is. Suppose it's time I left, eh? I, uh, I thought you might like these. It's all right. I've got plenty. Thank you. [SPEAKING FRENCH] You're very kind. Both of you. See you tomorrow, Sarge. Yeah. Yeah. I'll, uh, I'll just see Charlie to the gate. OK. Cheerio. Thanks for dropping by, Charlie. It's all right, Sarge. I had a really good time. Good. Listen, uh, I want to see the lieutenant. Can you get him to drop by? Sure, Sarge, sure. Good. - See you later. - Yeah. See you, Charlie. It's a nice orchard you have here. Mmm hmm. Normandy's famous for operas. Oh, yeah. But they are not ripe yet. They will be good in a few weeks. Yeah. In a few weeks, this will be like the Garden of Eden. [PLANE ENGINE HUMS] It's OK. It's all right. It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's all right. It's all right. Go away. I'm sorry. You know, I didn't mean to-- um, you got to towel? It doesn't matter. Hang on here. I'll get you one. I'm sorry. I've never taken a woman before if she didn't want it. Now you have. Belle. The bullets were so close I was afraid. I didn't want to lose you. None of my lovers ever did it to me. Oh, yeah. I forgot. You've had a busy life. Exactly. It's not easy for French girl to have fallen in love with a German boy you know. After he was gone, I was alone. I had no money. Do you know that a piano would by food for a week? And I couldn't pay the rent. So I moved in to someone's apartment. It's too late to change what we did. We were young. And they're too young to die. At least I was old enough. But tonight will be special. Please, I don't want to go. There won't only be Germans there you know. It'll be fun. [MUSIC PLAYING] Why did you put out the light? Am I ugly. No. No, you're all right. I like looking at you in the daytime. My hands, my face, but my body. I was always told that it was wrong to look at a woman naked. You belong to darkness. You're dark and cruel. You go in the dark to kill, to steal. [BELL TOLLING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [WHISTLING] How you doing? I'm just letting them know that, uh, that it's OK. Oh. Thanks. How's it going? Hey, I was thinking I'm sorry about yesterday. I-- I didn't know you had interests here. So I brought you some stuff. Brought you some cigarettes and fruit salad, Frank Sinatra. You like Frank Sinatra? Sure you do everybody likes Sinatra. OK, uh, you should be leaving tomorrow huh? I mean, we're both on the same side right? Look, just do me a favor. Tell her there's more where this came from, huh. I can get the bag back. Oh, here you go. Well, good luck. Hey, you like Sinatra? See you later. Cigarettes, cake, horse meat, eh. Anyway, I like these better than the English ones. Fruit salad, meat lunch, chocolate. [CHUCKLES] What's so funny? The Yanks you know. They expect you to be grateful for stuff that they give you. You know, they've got so much stuff anyway, they just can't help but give it away. It's a beautiful day. Think we should go for a picnic. All we need is a couple of beers. Wait a minute. I can do better. Don't really like wine. Also we can drink water. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't know what you're talking about. You don't not the poem? No. Have you been to Paris? Yeah. No. I know. It's reminds me a wonderful painting by Monet. Mmm hmm. Le Dejeuner sur l'herbe. The what? The picnic on the glass. Ah ha. There are two men and to girls having a picnic I guess. But the men are dressed like gentlemen, you know, waistcoat and everything. And one of the girls is quite naked. [CHUCKLES] She's like a classic nymph in Arcadia. Yeah. You don't know it. No, I don't but-- but it sounds, uh-- oh, it sounds very, very nice. Very nice. [GIGGLES] Is that all you can say? It's-- it's superb, a vision. Yeah. Yes. I would like to be like that, an Arcadian. You mean sitting on the grass with no clothes? Yes. You'll get prickles up your bum. [ENGINE APPROACHING] Hello, Scalby. How's your dirty weekend go? Reconnaissance is it, Scalby? You slipping her a bit of the old foie gras? It's not like that. MORTIMER: Never is. SAUL: I've got a bit of a problem. MORTIMER: What do you mean? She needs help. Got a checkered past is she? They're on our side. Don't get involved. It's too late. I am involved. Could get rather nasty. Look, you've got to do something. We'll have a chaplain see her. Thanks, mate. Don't interfere. You know what you're doing don't you? Yeah. All right, Smith. Sir. [ENGINE TURNS OVER] It was your officer? Oh, yeah. Lieutenant James Mortimer himself. BELLE: What did he say? He's going to help. How? Well, he don't know yet, but if anybody can help us, he can. You leave tomorrow. Am I going to live? Belle, you've never told me everything above that resistance cell. [CHATTER] What would you like, my dear? Yes? Coffee will be fine. Coffee for two. Do you know him? What? The waiter. You seem to know him. No. Why did you lie? We were friends once. Friends? Yes. Not lovers? Go on, admit it. He was your lover. Surely. You didn't think you would first. You little whore. Sorry. Dumb little whore. [SLAPPING] Soon after that, the Gestapo took the city, and Balthazar was killed. It has been so long. Yeah. I no longer hope. Oh, no. You have to have hope. You have to have hope. No hope. You know someday when all this is over, I'm going to go to New Zealand or maybe Australia. I've always wanted to go out that way. And when I do, I'm going to take you with me. If you're proposing, where are the flowers? And why are you not down on your knees? [GIGGLES] And how many children shall we have? Two. A boy and a girl. No, no boy. If the girl's anything like you, I'll have to really watch her. You watch me, too? Oh, yeah. I'll watch you like a hawk. Like a hawk watching a rabbit. I know if I am wicked. Nah, that doesn't matter. I'll just chop off his bollocks and fry them for breakfast. You are horrible. [RUMBLING] (SINGING) Each day who's never sad, who's always gay. I know she's acting a part you can see what goes on in her heart. Let us dance. I can't. I swear. I don't know how to dance. Really. I'll teach you. You will? Yeah. (SINGING) Yet they're lonely as only a woman's can be. For I see all her thoughts are somewhere, somewhere in France with you. While she's talking, she's talking of no one but you. She's so proud, oh, so proud of the things you will do. I can see all her love is somewhere, somewhere in France with you. And when your letters come, they bring a smile, a tear, each one a sweet souvenir. [ENGINE APPROACHING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] We need some more wood. I'll get you some more wood. [ENGINE APPROACHING] I'm sorry. We rely on them for intelligence and flank protection. We just can't afford to antagonize them. Oh, yeah. There is a war on you know. Don't. We're trying to liberate France, not protect French traitors. You bastard. 12 men, for Christ's sake. Listen, you. She's innocent. You've only got their word for it. Sergeant, if you're not back by noon, you're AWOL. How is it? It's good. Yeah. It's good. He's got a lot of very important friends high up. And they spoke to the local commander of the resistance. They've been told to push off and leave you alone. Perhaps, they'll be so. Yeah. I'll just finish off the wood. Saul, tell me again will it be all right. Belle, just supposing that-- would they really harm you? Haven't you heard anything I've said? They won't harm a hair of your head. I promise. [RUMBLING] Belle. You see. I told you it would be all right. Look. Where? [SLICING] [BELLE WINCING] So long. Hey, back off. Hey. [SHOUTING] Crazy Limey bastard! Get back here! Hey! [THUNDER RUMBLING]
