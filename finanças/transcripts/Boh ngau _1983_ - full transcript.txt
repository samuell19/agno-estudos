The substitute looks nervous Why sent him on? His name's Lee Tong, a newcomer to the side It's a strange decision to send him on I'm sorry It's alright now and play resumes Go on your own Lee just received the ball from his goalie He sure has some nice touches Pass it over! But he is going the wrong way He passes the ball to Chan Ming A reverse pass from Chan to him The pass was too long but Lee still gets it He slips two defenders Now he passes the ball back to Chan And Chan passes it back to him Pass it back The goalie calls for the ball It's a goal!

Are you scared? Remember now King treated you? Remember how King fixed a match We must get rid of people like King! I don't have you as a friend Play! Who are you? You must play no matter what happened This is a private match arranged by King They're using their legs as wager Let's do our best We can have a side bet, right This is going to be a real match! How about $1.000 for one goal? Sure, but don't forget this match is not fixed Substitutes are not allowed in this match And no audience is allowed in I am only exception The game is on Lee passes to Suen Suen does well to keep the ball in play It's a foul but the referee plays the advantage The ball is still with Lee The rebound is high and Lee will shoot! It hits the woodwork And the goalie throws himself at the ball Lee was just one step too late Lung Wah's on the attack now Go! King and Lee, what a pair King is now marked by two men And king will try anything he knows King's in possession now Mark him tight! And he passes the ball to the right wing Pay attention to his right foot And the winger passes it back to him King dribbled past Lee near the goal line And he scores with a banana snot King's really good Well? Clam down! What do you think? Want to carry on? Boss! Lung Wah lead by one goal Lee's having a private duel with King Tang entangled him, look strong Fight each other It's a throw in I know your tricks Suen gains possession in the penalty area And he passes the ball's back with Suen He evaded three men and passes the ball to Lee A couple of great dummies from Lee Down the goal line and a great cross It hits a defender and falls for Suen He chips it forward and Lee scores with a header Good job! They've pulled one back! Hsin Sang on the attack now It's a foul! The goalie saves well from Lee Suen tries to score from the rebound And King knocks it on to the crossbar And king saves the day again Be alert Now King's having a go at the goalie Block the referee! The match is turning into a fight the match is turning into a fight King and Lee are having a go at each other And the referee booked Lee What's going on? I'll sent you off if you do it again Referee! Suen is not happy about it Have you seen this before It's a free kick for lung Wah And the referee blows the whistle for halftime And the referee blows the whistle for halftime Lung Wah launch attack after attack But they're stopped by Hsin Sang Lee dribbled past several players He forgets about teamwork now It's a private duel between Lee and king It's a private duel between Lee and king King dashes into the penalty area Take care of him But he was dispossessed by Suen Suen starts a counter-attack And he was fouled from behind Heavy fall on the ground Sorry, I didn't mean it A free kick Hsin Sang and another name in the book Stand closer Take a few steps backward Let me try it Suen and Lee are having a conference They put one of their own men in the wall Lee moves away from the ball Suen shoots and hit the player in the face Suen shoots and hit the player in the face It looks like he has lost a tooth Here come Hsin Sang again Suen kicked Chan Ming The two are having a tussle But the referee waves play on Play on... Are you alright? Don't worry about me, watch king King has taken control of the game King has taken control of the game Come on! Hurry! He is ready to send over a cross King scores with a brilliant first time shot Two one. We're leading Now Suen retaliate Now Suen retaliate He has three players on him He plays a one two with Lee And Suen collides with the goalie But the referee waves play on Lung Wah are on the arrack again Play on! Don't stop! King has a great chance to score again King has a great chance to score again He rounded the goalie And he makes it three one The referee has gone over to Suen Are you okay? It looks like he is badly hurt Take him off! The referee has summoned for a stretcher One man short and time is running out Yes There's still a chance Light a cigarette Let's see what Lee can do without Suen He dribbled past a few players Pass it over But he does not have Suen to meet his pass The ball is robbed and Lung Wah attack Where's our teamwork? There are only a few minutes to go Lung Wan are leading by three one Fall back! Hsin Sang are still trying to draw level Or reduce the deficit What? Go away! And the ball is now back with the goalie Lung Wah are using time-wasting tactics Lee is now on his own Take it easy! He has no one to help him More time-wasting tactics from Lung Wah And they're passing the ball back and forth between them He's leg is mine Are you spitting again I'm sorry Again? No, it's raining! Every Hsin Sang players are in Lung Wah's half But there's nothing they can do The sky has just opened up The situation is bad for skilful players They just have to try their luck The ground has become very slippery It's muddy, too Lee have a go with a shot But is was saved by the goalie But the goalie dropped the ball It's in Hsin Sang's possession but... King slipped and Lee robbed him It's turning into a teal farce But time is running out on Hsin Sang Here's another chance for them Shoot! But Lee slipped just when he was about to shot He has even lost one of his boots Time is running out Lee is now bare footed But he plays on! He dribbled past two defenders And another one! He has king a front of him now His shot hits the goalie An overhead kick. It's a goal We've pulled another one back! We've pulled one back Cool it They're now only one goal behind Lee can surely play without boots Come on! Go for it! Can they draw level? Everybody is falling about on the pitch Only Lee can stand firm Lee is attacking on the right A great shot from the edge of the area But it was blocked by a defender King take off his boots but he can hardly walk Lee's now in the penalty area He shoot against a defender and the goalie saves Lee tries again but no luck It looks like Hsin Sang will lose this match The referee has been knocked off his feet Lee is charging towards goal But king robs him of the ball Lee shoots and the goalie saves Lee shoots again! But king saves on the goal line This time your leg's mine Catch it! He passes the ball back to the goalie But the ball bounces over the goalie's head And it gets stuck in the water It is not a goal The ball is loose Both Lee and king are racing towards it King beats Lee but it's an own goal The final score is three all You'll soon vanish from the scene Break both his legs We did it at the very last moment Thanks to king who scored for us You're in luck today Right! King deserved to be punished Left or right? Both! Like him? Can you spare a dime please? Just like him "I do get tired, wanting to throw in the towel" "It's tought! But there is no choice” "Tired to the marrow, I must keep on going" "It's I myself who goads me on the thorny path” "I challenge myself to new heights,” "whatever the battleground"
