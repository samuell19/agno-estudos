STUDIO 2.0 presents In Association with KTB and KOFIC A Film Dorothy Production October, 1979 This footage is a record of the brain surgery performed in 1942 on General Hirai of the Japanese army. Dr. Kim Dong-Won performed the operation, being the best neurosurgeon respected by the Japanese medical society. That's all for today. JIN GOO As I mentioned before, today's footage will be on the test. DONG-KYU LEE If you weren't paying attention, get help from my assistant. KIM TAE-WOO Tell your friends at the protest, they'll be failing for sure... KIM BO-KYUNG ...if they miss next week's test. It's Dad. Let's have lunch together. Oh , already? Are you busy? Dinner? No, it's okay. I can take care of myself. Don't come. Stubborn girl. The desk? Yes, what is it? It's really my old album. They found it at Anseng Hospital? After all these years? When are they tearing it down? The hospital. Oh, tonight. Since it's the weekend. All right. See you at home, then. Okay. Directed by Jung Brothers You should get anything you left inside. After tonight, it will all be gone. Are you lonely, Dad? Huh? Of course not. The coffee tastes good. Dad. Don't be so hard on yourself. You know Stepmom had heart problems even before the marriage. Yes, but your mother and all... Mom passed away while having me. Stepmom had a chronic disease. Neither was your fault. It's just... ...they both passed away like that, within less than a year of marrying me. Dad! I know. I know. I'll be back from the in-laws tomorrow. Then I'll stop by with some food. Don't come so often. I can just hire help. Otherwise, I'll miss you too much. I'll come by again with Yoon-Hee. That was the last time I saw my daughter. I thought I would forget with time. I thought I had lived a quiet life. I see that those four days 37 years ago had made my life an endless nightmare. On that night, I died. EPITAPH In February 1942, just as I began studying medicine, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and imperialism was at its peak. But inside Anseng Hospital, it was as quiet as the eye of a storm. Do ghosts really appear in the mirrors? Sure. Staring at mirrors in the morgue? Scary. But you better not break that mirror. - Why? - Why? Hey, the rounds. Let's go. Lucky bastard. What? While some of us stay up for weeks, someone's going to sit back and relax. But sure, you're in high society now. Keep your voices down. Jung-Nam Park. You're on morgue duty this whole week. - A week? - A week? The refrigerating system is faulty, so make sure to check it often. - Lucky. - Congrats, Jung-Nam. Director's orders, so don't fuss over it. Yes, sir. Aoi is back from Tokyo. I see. Do you remember her? Only that I saw her when I was young. Right. She's all grown up now. She's grown so beautifully. My husband and your parents would have cared much for her. I'm just sorry that they couldn't see two such fine young people marry. I'm always thankful for your care. Taking me in after my parents passed away and supporting my education. I only did what I thought was proper. I truly think of you as my own son, and not just because of the betrothal. Thank you. I know it seems a bit rushed , but we should have it in Spring. I'd like for you two to marry right away, but it will take some time to prepare things on our side. Anyway, that's my decision. Yes, Ma'am. AUTOPSY LAB Time of death was about 30 hours ago. Judging by the odor, isn't it longer? But, of course, you must be right. A soldier was killed while delivering documents from Busan to Seoul. The body was mangled, but the papers left untouched. Who in the world would do something like this? What was the motive? He's only been in Korea for one week. Dr. Kaneda, I'd like a word with you. A Japanese soldier was murdered, so the press will be determined to get any information out of you. Therefore, don't comment on anything in front of the reporters besides your medical opinion. I'll handle the difficult questions. As I mentioned before, the victim was stabbed by a sharp and long metal object. Doctor! What led the killer to mangle the body? Looking at how the body was stabbed many times after the victim had died, it seems the killer may have had much hostility toward the victim. That student will need time to get used to autopsy. By the way, are you ready for your first lecture? Everyone says they're a tough crowd, worse than us back in the day. I'm so tired. How's autopsy? I threw up everything I ate this morning. Wimp. We've all been there. Never mind that. What's with the murder case? Guys, another body just came in. Anyone seen it? Another one? The teenage girl? So you saw it. This girl's body just came in, all frozen up like a piece of meat. I tell you, it's perfect. This one is a real looker. Almost like an angel fallen from heaven. Put the mirror away. The door left open, and the bodies still lying around... Jung-Nam Park. Yes, sir? You're scared, aren't you? No, sir. Clean these bodies up and put them in. Yes, sir. Those chemicals will spill over. Line them up right. Yes, sir. Don't waste time doing stupid things. GHOSTS Professor. Then does that mean you believe that ghosts exist? Don't you like the ring? I used to have one like this. A keepsake from my parents. But I lost it last year while moving to Seoul, like an idiot. To be honest, I never thought of becoming a doctor. You see, I liked to draw. In a few months, I'm marrying the director's daughter, and I've never even met her. When I look at you, you just look so happy. It's like your best years have been sealed forever. ANSENG HOSPITAL Why are they coming out in this weather? Why not? It's snowing. It's nice. Idiot. That's strange, isn't it a bit late for snow? Jung-Nam! Why didn't you bring your dead friends? Man, I just love blackouts. Please... Don't let them fix it, just for one night! Hey, the lights! Damn it. No! I'm sorry. Jung-Nam! Leave us at least a few bottles to use! Jung-Nam Park, are you okay? Yes, sir. She needs to realize it's not her fauIt. Then she'll come to accept her parents death. I'm sorry, sir. Let's try medications and psychoanalysis treatment. Yes, sir. Jung-Nam? Here you are. I was looking for you. She's beautiful, isn't she? Yes, Ma'am. They still haven't found the body of the man she committed suicide with. It took over four days just to search. How cold she must have been... Anyway, what was the time when you were born? Oh, about 2 am. on June 3rd, 1920. I see, 2 am. on June 3rd, 1920. That was why I came to see you, but here I am rambling on. What's that sound? It's so creepy. Who is sobbing at this time of night? It's coming from the funeral home. Where did the drawing go? I don't know how to thank you, Sister. Am I being greedy by marrying her dead soul to his living body? Perhaps so. But I can't let her soul reunite with the man that made her die. This child was brought in two days ago, after barely surviving a car accident. What's wrong with you? Get over here and grab her! Come on! Look for injuries! Yes, sir! 2 days ago Hold her down! Poor girl. She has to survive, at least for her mother's sake. That's her mother? Yes. There aren't any injuries. It's like a miracle. A miracle? What is? She survived without even a bruise in a crash that took her whole family. They say life is up to fate. Things aren't always for us to decide. There it goes again. Mommy? If she wasn't hurt at all, then why the nightmares and aphasia? Just seeing her parents die is enough shock for a little girl. And she was the sole survivor, which might make her feel guilty. Mommy. I Iove you. I love you, too. Since it's your first day, we'll stop here. Asako. Can you remember what you told me? It's okay. When I was five years old, there was a deserted house a few blocks from my house. My brother and I went there to take some eggs that a pheasant had laid inside the well. He told me to stay back, but I didn't listen and leaned over, and I fell down the well. It was deeper than I thought, and the water had all dried up. I kept crying and calling for him because my right leg was hurting. He tried to climb down a rope, but he fell in, as well. I was so scared, but he kept telling me that we were sure to be rescued and not to worry. I did what he said and survived on eggs and water. And just like he had said, people came to rescue us. But they said that he was already dead, still holding on to my hand. People still say... ...on that night... ...he was the reason I survived. I know what you're going through. I was in that place before. Try to feel better, Asako. Everything will be fine. Koshiro? Koshiro! Koshi... Koshiro! From now on, you should call me Dad. - Hurry up, Han! - Yes, sir! Asako. Let's have one more talk together, and you won't have nightmares anymore. It's just like yesterday. Okay. Just relax. Don't worry. I'll be right here, next to you. Right now, you're going to meet that man. The man that you love. Let's go now to the time you first met him. Over there. Asako. It's your new dad. Let's say hello. I'm Koshiro Onji. It's nice to meet you. I love you too, Koshiro! I love you too. Asako, you should call him Dad. I'm going to sleep with Koshiro. Stop fooling around, Asako. Koshiro is driving. That's enough. Sit down. I wish you would just go away. Asako, come on. What are you doing? Why do you get to sleep with him, and why do you get to love him? I hate you! Just go away! I'm going to live with Koshiro! Asako! It's... It's all my fault. It's not your fault, Asako. The emotions trapped in her subconscious have been brought out and resolved. She also has regained her consciousness. I think I've done everything I can. Ma'am? I see. That's good to hear. Good work. Asako's mother can rest in peace now. Please take care of her from now on. I am counting on you. Yes, Ma'am. You'll be okay now, Asako. I'll finish up my rounds quickly, and then I'll stay here with you. Everything will be fine, okay? She was fine just a minute ago. - Any emergency measures? - Done, sir! Go on ahead! Doctor! - Get a syringe ready. - Yes, sir. Asako? Asako! Come back! Open your eyes! Asako! Mom... It's okay. It's not your fault, Asako. Doctor. Asako! Sir! She's gone. You did your best, sir. They say death heals all wounds. In that last moment, what could have given her such peace? Perhaps Asako had stayed a bit longer in order to find that peace. AUTOPSY LAB 3 days ago Time of death was about 30 hours ago. A soldier was killed while delivering documents from Busan to Seoul. The body was mangled, but the papers left untouched. Who in the world would do something like this? What was the motive? I still didn't know back then the fact that my wife didn't have a shadow. That student will need time to get used to autopsy. By the way, are you ready for your first lecture? Everyone says they're a tough crowd, worse than us back in the day. In those times, all scientifically inexplicable phenomenon was accounted for as superstition, but with various cultural characteristics. For example, in the East, being haunted or possessed was actually a cultural interpretation of multiple personality disorder. What about the ghosts in haunted houses? It's an interesting question. Ghosts. They're believed to be the souls of the dead. A western scientist did something interesting, where he attempted to weigh a person just before and after death. You would expect the weight to be the same. But oddly enough, there was a minute difference between the two measurements. Based upon the result, some people say that this difference is the weight of the soul. It's certainly difficult to explain scientifically. Professor! Then does that mean you believe that ghosts exist? Well, probably not the ones in haunted houses. Like most of you, I haven't actually seen them. However, I would like to believe that we have souls. It would be too depressing if we didn't. Wouldn't you agree? It was a Korean soldier that escaped four days ago. It's the same as the previous cases. Yes, both the weapon and method. He was just a child. A serial killer after Japanese soldiers... Until the investigation progresses, please keep this case quiet. You too, Jung-Nam. Yes, sir. Jung-Nam! Why didn't you bring your dead friends? Someone made some rice snacks. Try some, Doctor. In-Young, did you go anywhere last night? Pardon? Never mind. Did you have any strange dreams? I'm so tired these days. I can't remember how I got to bed, let alone my dreams. Do you like it that much? These two, don't they look like us? When we're outside in the garden. I'll say. Even the streetlight looks the same. Hold on. Honey? Wait. Just stay still. Honey. Walk slowly towards me. You... In-Young. One year ago, In-Young died in Japan. How could I have forgotten? And... How can she be standing before me? Dear, don't ever leave me. I'll be with you even after I die. Can you promise me that you'll never leave me? Why would I ever leave you? I'll stand by you, even in the afterlife. In-Young. Don't do it. I know... ...that you're in pain. But... ...we were always together. Stop now, honey. I'll take care of this. Give that to me. Now! In-Young! No! Nurse Choi! Nurse Choi! In-Young. Do you like it that much? What's on your mind? I was waiting for you, worrying if you had left me. In-Young. Let's go back to Japan. Your arm... What happened? Why are these cuts...? In-Young. Major! It's a nurse from Anseng Hospital. Why did the killer leave her body on such a busy road? In order to conceal it, of course. It was dark and foggy that night, and if you're in a hurry, this may look like quite a cliff when looking down from up there. But... ...why is it a nurse this time? Since it wasn't a Japanese soldier, maybe someone copied the serial killer. No. It doesn't look different to me. It's the same killer. It was next to the body, sir. Was the Korean soldier wearing a jacket? No, he wasn't, sir. This is Dong-Won Kim from Anseng Hospital. I'm the culprit of the recent murders. Please come and arrest me. - If Kim shows up, keep him here. - Yes, sir! You're sure it was Dong-Won Kim? Yes. Let's go. It may be hard to understand, but there are two people inside me. Dong-Won Kim and a murderer. In short, the culprit of the recent serial killings is me, Dong-Won Kim. Dr. Dong-Won Kim? Furthermore, do not believe anything I say or do. I state again, the serial killer... ...is me. Go and search the hospital. I will go meet Dr. Kaneda. Yes, sir. Dr. Kaneda. Dr. Kaneda. Dr. Kaneda. Dr. Kaneda. What brings you here? I guess Dr. Kim isn't in? He hasn't come home yet. He's running late today. I see. How long have you two been married? Almost a year now. I see. Come in and have a seat. I'll get you a cup of tea. Insane. Completely insane. Doctor. Yes? I've heard that back in Japan, Dr. Kim... Yes, the culprit got away. Send somebody to Anseng Hospital now. Yoshida. Yes, sir! Gather up all of the patients. Yes, sir! Who else is in the hospital right now? The patients and the director... One intern went to do an autopsy. Autopsy? Yes. What in the...? Nurse Choi! I never ordered an autopsy. Damn it! What's going on? Woo-Shik! - It's Dr. Lee! - Doctor! What happened? - A hit and run. - What do we do? None of the doctors are in. Get him to emergency. Jung-Nam, get the director. Okay. Aoi. I already miss you so. I love you. Ma'am. Put it down. Put that knife down now! I said, now! Major. Please make me stop. In-Young, my dead wife, is inside me. Please. Please, just stop me! You're not Dong-Won Kim. Your husband died last year in Japan! He's just a false image you created! You are In-Young Kim! They're believed to be the souls of the dead. However, I would like to believe that we have souls. It would be too depressing if we didn't. Wouldn't you agree? Give it up now. Stop! How lonesome... I haven't seen you ever since. But I know that you were always by my side. Tell me. If you were going to leave me all alone, then why didn't you just take me with you that night? Back then, we believed everything would last forever.
