Things fall apart. I always believed zombie movies were silly. The zombies moved slow and would eventually rot away. Even if they ran or attacked in waves, the military could fry them and militias in every town and city would gun them down. Contagion movies were always scarier. Elwood was formed out of necessity, contained by a barrier I ordered made from anything, including the walls of a vacant church. God left us long ago to face the choices of our actions. I was a military doctor turned leader of Elwood. I had wells and water sources constantly tested for contamination and created a system of evicting those who fell to infection. It was my responsibility to keep the fear contained, even if I could not contain the plague itself. A girl's pregnancy confirmed my belief that what was happening outside our fence was bigger than anything a movie could dream up. I waited for this endgame to play out. I held things together as best I could. Life is about choices and this was a result of man's choices, not God's. I accepted my choice because fences come down and things fall apart. A military man named Seiler drafted the last of our young people to patrol the fence line, to go outside and to bring back food, fuel, and supplies. The townsfolk called them zombie killers. Seiler and his team embraced the name. With uniforms cobbled together from sportswear nabbed during supply runs, they used paintball guns for training, recreation, and to discourage the fog of war, and to prevent his team from choking up in real battle. I saw them as a symbol of stability allowing our town to sleep better at night and to move more freely during the day. Seiler saw this collection of orphans and misfits as his own. Shock one, shock one! That stuff still tastes like shit. Where was your cover, Kennedy? We just shot the president, people. - Who's responsible? - My bad, Ma'am President. President Kennedy. Oh, man, I love it. You said that like ten times before we started. - What was that? - I wasn't-- That's right. You weren't. Yeah, Ian, what the hell? You wanna die on this hill, Dutra? No. No, sir. It's all good, Ian. I'm not the first Kennedy to take a headshot. It's not all good. It's still a country. And that crack about the president was uncalled for. Show some respect. That's why you're pulling guard duty while we go on the hunt. Now, Radler, where's your head? Where's your head mask for that matter, Andrew Lloyd Webber? Other side of the fence? We need you here. - Yes, sir. - Come on, newbie. You're one of us now. No, no, no, please! No, no! No! You got it wrong, Doc. Somebody please listen to me. It was wrong. - Sit down, Lenna. - No. You stop it. No. No. This isn't about my grass being too high or my house not being kept up. Somebody's gotta say it. Doc ain't God. We're all pretending that this is normal? Does this look normal? Lia, please say something. I ain't sick. Accept his righteous judgment. No. No! You don't have to go, Lenna. Listen to him, Lenna. You listening? You still have a choice. I've changed my mind. He was a man of action, a man of war. - On great occasions such as... - Here they come. ...the funeral of a village celebrity... ...he drank his palm wine out of his first human head. We should head down before they catch wind of her. Me and the boys would like to stick around a little bit. I mean, I know we ain't the kids, but we could use the practice in picking off a few. Suit yourself. Hike back. Get your rounds done as well. You got it? Whoa! Morning, cupcake. What is Nikki doing with a boy like you? Whoa. Easy now. See, little boys kick stones. Men kick ass. You feel good doing what you do? Doc likes to keep things looking as good as possible. Your trailer's seen better days. When are you gonna get that up to code, soldier? What are you gonna do, evict me? Why don't you just move in one of the closer houses? Because it was my dad's, and in case you forgot, my mom's really sick and can't be moved. See, when you're sick, you get better. She's not sick, sport. She's dying. So why don't you stop living for dead people and start thinking about your brother and take care of your mom the right and merciful way? See what you don't wanna do right now is try and act tough with such a stupid-looking uniform. Zombie killers. - Fuck you. - Right. When did you shut the genny down? I was on time, relax. Take this. Dero was by. Don't ever let him in. Got it? I know. I know. I hate him. Hi, Mom. Hey. What time did you get in? Just now. Here. - It's cold. - Oh! Oh, what I'd give for a nice cold beer again. You didn't get too beat up today? We go out in the morning. Deer hunt. Keep your eyes open, Ian. I do, Mom. Always. Not for them, honey. For you. Look up. Look ahead. I'm more afraid of what's behind me. I hope there'll be a time when you don't have to be. You go be with Collin. There was another eviction today and he's upset. It was Lenna. Circle back with Nolan. Keep an eye on things. I'll be fine. It's not you I'm worried about. - Cut it with your knife. - You already know, baby. We're going further out every time. Well, there's less and less of them. And there's less and less game. We gotta go out further. Deer was never scarce. - Neither were we, though. - It's not funny. - They don't eat deer. Do they? - Maybe they do now. There's three. Hold your fire. Radler. Come on, let's go. - Any day now, son. - Yes, sir. Breathe. Be steady. You're not gonna shoot the first squirrel that comes out on a branch. You're gonna wait. I'm just sayin'. How do we know they're not human? Because they're walking like movie zombies. - Now just take your shot. Huh? - Okay. They're not human. Not anymore. Good shooting. Go ahead. How'd that feel? I just don't ever wanna hit a real person. Yeah, that's not pleasant. It wasn't a headshot, but it's a miracle you hit him at all. That's good shooting. That's never gonna be me. This will guarantee it. Black. Blood's always black. Grip the fear, Radler. Listen to him, son. That's what makes sure you don't end up like that. Hi, sweetheart. Is your husband home? Can I ask why you need to speak with him? I'm here to spread the good news. Rory. What is it, Lia? Slow day at the old cult camp? I'm just taking advantage of this beautiful, blessed day to come talk to you. Have you given much thought to where you go when you'll die? Hopefully not the same place as you. You're a conflicted man, Rory Jacobs, and I know your pain. Worry about your own pain, Lia. You've despoiled a child. She should be with the last of her kind guarding the community, serving God, and not catering to your lustful desires. Let me in. Let's talk. God knows you. He speaks of you. He tells me things. What are you so afraid of? That maybe I'm right? That maybe your old hands upon the downy hair between her-- Get off of my property. Let God in, Rory. Let me in. Let your soul be saved before they consume it. I won't say it again. Let... me in. God bless. Well, thank you, you brave soldiers, for feeding us. I think the wildlife out there is being infected by the groundwater. We continue to test the streams and wells weekly. I wanna go out to the fracking site. No need to go out that far. I think this might be starting underground, Doc. If that's the case, it could leak into our aquifer. We make house calls to test for that, Rory. You don't seem too concerned, Doc. Look, if it makes you feel better, talk with Seiler. Take his team up to the gas well. But you can't take his whole team. They're needed here. We got Dero, but that can go either way. You know what I mean. I'll take two. - Hey. - Can I help you? Just in the neighborhood-- So... So? - Why me? - Oh, my God, Ian. How many times are we going to have this conversation? No, honestly. I mean, Stoller, Manning, they're so much more your type. Okay, so I'll just go date one of them. The only unattractive quality you have is your completely lack of confidence. I mean, you're sweet, and you're different. And you're-- I don't know. You're what I need. You know, I really wish you wouldn't smoke. Oh, yeah, 'cause this is what's gonna kill me. It didn't bite me! It didn't bite me! Bite check. Been a while they been this close to the fence. Anybody seen 'em this close to the fence lately? No, sir. First squirrel. Arm up, wheels up. Manning to Sarge. We're at gate three. Run the entire... I guess we should go and inspect gate three then. Has Ian inspected gate three yet? Just ask me if I'm screwing him already. I'm asking. Are you friends with Toni, Nolan? Over here. Ah, isn't that beautiful? Leftovers, huh? Must have been attracted to Lena. Why do they make a show of the evictions? I never understood that. You know my parents were evicted? My dad was bit and my mom went with him. Why make it public? Just kick 'em out. It sends a message, I guess. They didn't do that where I came from. That's why you had to come here. Come on. Radler. I wanna drive, Nolan. You always drive. Piece of shit. You know, sometimes-- sometimes I just look at this like it's a whole lot of nothing. Look at this. Do you really think if a whole horde came, that this will hold them off for one second? I mean, I've seen some fast ones out there. They run, but we do have nature on our side. They're just gonna-- they're rotting away. I mean, they gotta fall apart eventually. They have to. Look, you can't just believe that we're the only ones here. Look, seriously. You're trying to tell me that the entire U.S. military just got its ass kicked by a bunch of corpses? It sounds stupid. Instead of this mess, we just-- we build a moat and we put these spikes in it and we let 'em fall in. You know, as many as it takes to fill it up. Then we just pour gas down the trenches, light that mofo up and KFZ. Kentucky Fried Zombie. I like the sound of that. - Dutra. - What? Shit. It's Lenna. They... Dero and his idiots didn't get the head. - I got this. - Wait. - Lenna. - Whoa, Ian. - Lenna. - Ian, don't talk to her, man. Manning to Dutra. All good there? Dutra to Manning. Yeah, we're fine. Your head is so far up your ass, you're tea-bagging your tonsils. I just wanna see if there's anything left in her in case this is gonna be my mom. Look, your mom-- Your mom's got cancer. And we're all screwed anyway. But once you die, that's it. You're dead. What are you feeling? I know why you took my blood. No, you don't. You don't need blood for this, do you? It's just a precaution, Toni. Everything's fine. Really. Am I infected? So far, no. Well, I've been spotting. Black. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Can you save some next time? Is my baby infected? Not yet. Well, not yet? - How do you know? - It's still growing. How do you know for sure? Listen, Toni, you're not infected, so I have to assume the baby isn't, either. I don't have the proper instruments to do an amniocentesis. I could kill it. There's something you're not telling me. It's just that there's-- First pregnancies can be tricky. Just need to keep a close eye on you. Rory. Seiler's good for the run. What run? We'll talk about it later. So why is Rory going to that fracking well? Because it doesn't matter what he finds there. I wanna know what he finds there. The goal is to hold on as long as we can. Let him go. Got some work to do on his girl anyway. That Nolan kid has some work to do on her, too. Rory doesn't need to know that. So what are your tests showing? I'm not sure yet. I want you to keep an eye on Lia. As things get worse, she's gonna heat up her sinners in the hands of an angry God bit. I'll snuff that fire. We give thanks. Now let's hear the words from our beloved sister Lia. Thank you, Joe. Jesus said the church was his rock. This is ours. We are sheep who have fenced out the wolves from taking our bodies - and our souls. - I just wanna go up there - and tell her to shut up. - So do it. - We tore down our refuge... - Maybe I will. ...our place of worship, to take the wood and the materials to build a fence for our community to keep us safe. If you have the love of God in your heart... ...nothing can harm you. Not even from the outside. And it is our children who protect us under the leadership of our hero Sergeant Seiler. And they keep us safe. And every day those children... ...battle for their souls. And it is the children and the fence that stand between us and Hell. And the fallen have given a child, Rory Jacobs. You took one as a wife. Good Christians know what you are. Well, thank God for good Christians. Go home to your whore, Rory. Who touched you in your naughty place to turn you into this, Lia? You people better wake up. You can sing and pray all you want, but God has nothing to do with this or with what's going on out there... ...or with her. Strong words from a wife-killer. - You don't got it. - I got it. Here we go. Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho! - Nice. - Nice shot, Stoller. - Thank you, sir. - Manning reporting fire. There's some squirrels in some bushes. Everything's fine, over. All right, all right. All right, I got this. You see that one? Yeah, yeah. Where you going? - Shoot 'em in the ball sack. - Dutra, come on. We're soldiers. We don't talk like that. Uh, I'm gonna shoot 'em in the groin? I'll allow it. Oh, yeah! Get some! I know they're not human anymore, but Jesus. It still doesn't feel right. All right, guys, just headshots from now on, all right? Just headshots. All right, headshot. Hey, Manning, what are you at now? 324. 324? Wow. Here's 325. Nice shot, man. Radler's got a lot of catching up to do, I tell you that. Nah, I like that kid. I think he's gonna fit in just fine. Yeah, we just gotta break him in. Just like everybody else. Remember Ian? - Remember how we broke him in? - Where is he? - He's with Nikki. - Oh. - Nikki! - What does she see in him? - I don't get it. - Oh, she's sees some swagger! - All right, all right. - Get out of here. All right, guys, come on. Let's do 'em a favor. We're doing ourselves a favor, man. Most importantly, we're doing the town a favor. Let's go. Maybe you guys can pick up some fresh tobacco on your next shopping trip. Yeah, I'll put that on the list. So are you gonna tell me? I don't know. I had to leave. So I didn't really hear anything. I don't know. Dero was really creeping me out. And I, you know, wanted to come see you before you went back out. You ever think of leaving? Going where? That'd be like trading one pile of shit for another. What if we could go to a better place? Yeah, my dad used to show me all those old zombie movies where they're always searching for a better place. They don't exist. We will die here. And what would be so wrong with dying like this? And why are you so serious? Jeez! I'm leaving when my mom's gone. You know that. What if Elwood is the place? What do you mean? I mean, what if Elwood is the better place? What if we're where the survivors are searching for? This isn't living. Your parents, they let you play house over here. Yeah, and you guys play army up on the hill, Ian. It's the same bullshit. Can't win. Stop! Your generator looked a little empty. Figured I could top it off for you. - He keep you happy? - What? Your old man, does he do it for you? You going deaf? No, I heard your bullshit. You got a bun in the oven. And I heard that Nolan kid was the baker. Yeah, well, I hear a lot of things, too. Maybe you need a man. Not an old man. Or a boy to help take care of the both of you. You recommend one? If you have a clean baby, maybe I could be the Adam to your Eve. Get away from me. You think Rory should know? About Toni and Nolan? Yeah. No. She's with Rory now. She made her decision. It was for a good reason. You respect that. If you could have seen Lia at the gathering... Lia's been nuts ever since I've known her. I've seen her in action plenty of time. So why does she always attack Rory and Toni? 'Cause she's nuts. That's why she built that compound thing down there. It's almost like a cult. I see you. Why are you drinking? Why aren't you? 'Cause I'm pregnant. And I don't have a problem. Neither do I. Tomorrow's a big day. If I get-- If something happens to me, you know how to use the gun. First on me. Then on yourself. But you have to remember to pull the trigger really slowly, because if you even flinch... I'm so tired. You're so drunk. I just always wanted to take good care of you. I owe you everything. For that, I am so sorry. - Nothing gets in. - Nothing gets in. Don't forget to pick up some sunscreen, ChapStick... more ammo! We'll be back. Please come back. Let me play devil's advocate here. What do you hope to gain by this little jaunt of ours? I don't know exactly. But I think I have an idea of what started all this. So you figured out what the rest of the country couldn't? Is that it? Maybe. All right. Well... Since I stuck my neck out and I left the rest of the crew back at base, can I ask you a question? Sure. Did you kill your first wife? Yes. How's the sex? What? Are you tearing each other up? We're surrounded by zombies and you find this conversation shocking? Tell me honestly. When you make love, do you just get lost in the moment? It's great. Oh, good. I just want you to feel real passion, real joy, 'cause otherwise then all you feel is real fear. I'm sorry. My parents' birds and the bees stuff was much less intense than this. Just love each other. Love each other and go live. Live. I'm disappointed every morning I open my eyes again. Elwood and I are just waiting to die. I know. Then leave, Nikki. You go take that risk together. 'Cause it's worth it. What do you think, Sarge? Almost 30 miles out, still haven't seen one. Wish we had. You know you're in trouble when you start missing those sons of bitches. If that company did anything to the water, the answer's gonna be in that office. Let's go. Never heard of carpooling? Sarge, you sure no ATVs down there? What do we do if too many show up? Well, you don't say, "We got company." You definitely don't say, "We're gonna need a bigger boat." Or "Yippie-kai-yay, motherfracker!" Motherfracker? Or "I'm getting too old for this shit." Forget it, Jake. It's Zombietown. No more wire hangers. That'll do, pig. That'll do. Manning, Ian, take in the sights. All right, get what you came for. Just make it fast. Should have let us bring the ATVs down. I do not like the idea of us being trapped on foot. Rory thinks this place has something to do with it? Don't know. Doesn't matter anyway. Let's get out of here. I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass, and I'm all out of bubblegum. No, let's make like a tree and get out of here. For real, come on. It's more than just staying alive. Fill me in sometime. So what do you mean? Kennedy doesn't matter? Is there anything you wanna say about the two of you? It's a simple question, Ian. Ah, shit. They were underground. They came out of the pit. Well, run, Forrest. Run! I am getting too old for this shit. Good work. It's not right. This is not right. They're not fast. We're-- we're slow. Did you take your aspirin today? No. Oh, shit. I don't know what's worse, having a heart attack or getting eaten by these sons of bitches. What's that? That's not a good sound. That's not a good sound. Let's go. Let's move. Sorry. Let's go. Wait. - Wait. - Wait. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! - On the floor! - We're not infected! Move! Take cover! All right, easy. Easy. Check 'em. - We're not infected, okay? - Yeah, yeah. - Get your hands off her. - Listen. Daddy likes his new gun? What happened to you? Your back tire kicked up a rock and caught me is what happened to me. I wasn't bitten, if that's what you're thinking. Zip 'em! It's a real bitch trying to eat like this. Soon as we get you back to Elwood and Doc gives you a clean bill of health, we'll cut 'em off you. Till then, you're welcome. For what? You drive into us, pull guns, and kidnap us? I know trust is hard to come by. In case you haven't noticed, the deer have taken to eating us. You don't know if we're infected. And we don't know if you're gonna take us back to your camp, rape her or eat us for dinner. Or who knows what else? Either way we're fattening you up, right? So eat. What were you two doing out there anyway? We were coming to you. To the fracking site? Your town. You're from Elwood. We might have room for a couple more. Doc will decide that. We weren't coming there to live. We were coming there to warn you. Thanks for helping while Ian's gone. Of course. You love my brother? Uh... He means a lot to me. Is he coming back? Yeah. How do you know? I don't. Then why say it? 'Cause it makes us both feel better. Is my mom gonna get better? No. Hmm. - Ah? - Ah. Okay. All good under the hood. No bites anywhere, but the blood will be definitive. Open. When will you know? Within the hour. How about a little background information about you and your warning? Release us and then we'll talk. How about you just tell us? Back off, Dero. If it means all us dying, they need to say. We're dying from the day we're conceived. An hour won't kill us. This bandage will. You got scissors? Oh. Hey, hey. Hey, Kennedy, wait. Is Manning gonna have a problem with this? He knows. Pay attention. I've been doing this a while. Kennedy, what the hell? Get a grip. What is that stuff? A little perfume. Deer blood, my blood. Yours? What? Like I said, get a grip. Maybe they didn't hear the gunshot. They heard. And there they are. Stay calm, stay calm. Like Manning says, this is about gripping the fear. Black eyes. They have black eyes. I know. Watch them. - I'm dropping 'em. - No, not yet. - Yes! - No! They're turning. Why are they turning? Something's calling them. Kennedy, hey, what are you doing? I'll be right back. Kennedy! Kennedy! Kennedy! So that's how it spreads. It has gills. What the hell? What the hell was that? What the hell was that? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Help! Help! That's all well and good, but how long are we talking about? Which indicates fracking dredged up this prehistoric protozoa. I mean, I think we have a glimpse of what helped the asteroid take out the dinosaurs. The asteroid smacks us, throw up the protozoa, wiped out the dinosaurs, went back down into the Earth. Here we are again. The what and the why don't matter so much. We think it hijacks the central nervous system, shutting it down, but keeping the dying body alive like a puppet, controlling the brain similar to toxoplasmosis. The protozoa keeps the body alive to serve as an incubator of sorts. We've watched gravesites. Yeah, and nothing's coming out of the ground, all right? So-- The dead bodies don't come back. The protozoa kill the body, somehow mutate, then run it into the ground. The bites spread it through the saliva. They don't eat. They bite to spread the protozoa. It's reproduction. But we've found eaten bodies, human and animal. - Yeah. - Something else got at them then. Some might have a natural defense to it. I mean, that would be an explanation for dinosaurs and reptiles being targeted while other species survive. - Dinosaur-- - Why are they coming here? Ever hear of an elephant's graveyard? - Yeah, who hasn't? - Sure, I mean-- It's a legend that older elephants walk miles to a destination to die. Now theories range from food and water searches, to the effects of malnutrition. Whatever the reason, something draws them to these certain points where they slip into comas and die. Yeah, but why are they coming here? We don't know. Looking for a better place? Residual human memory? What we do know is Elwood is in their way. I think you are talking out of your ass. The outside world has been decimated. Yeah, so what? Elwood's an elephant's graveyard? How do we know they're not changing direction? You don't understand, okay? They're miles across. Millions of them. Even if they did change direction by a few miles, it will still cover this entire community. All right. So how long are we talking? Stragglers fall back, merge with the wave like army ants. - How long? - Soon. We've seen more coming away from Elwood as we move closer. Water pulls back from a beach before a tsunami. As always, blood results are available at my office. They chose eviction. Let us pray. Here. You're both infected. We came here. We warned you. Please, just let us go. Please. Cut 'em loose. Go. You're not gonna warn them? If the sun were going to explode tomorrow and you knew, would you tell anyone? Wouldn't change anything. All you'd do is make people live their last moments in fear. What's the official story gonna be? Just what we said down below. It's enough. It won't be for Rory or Seiler. Get them when the time comes. We'll deal with it. Where the hell are they? Should be at least a few of them out there by now. Maybe they're afraid of your boys. Should be more afraid of me. It's time we talk. Tomorrow. I've been waiting for you to get home. I never could sleep till I knew you were home. There's a lot more going on out there than you're telling me, and I need you to promise that if things go down the wire and they get in, - you're not gonna let me turn. - I can't. Son. I brought you into this world. I need you to help me out. Do you understand? Yes. I'm gonna die here... ...but I never wanted my kids to. When I'm gone, you take your brother and Nikki and you get out of Elwood. I don't know who long we'll be. Good luck, Seiler. Copy that. I think we can handle it, Sarge. Where do you keep the paint, you know, in case we get attacked? Moving out. Where do we keep the paint? Asshole. You cool with hanging back? Yeah, I mean after last night, somebody has to keep an eye on things, you know? Check in on my mom just in case Nikki needs anything. Nikki? Nikki can kick my ass. Could she kick yours, huh? You into that stuff, huh? Be safe, all right? Watch yourself, too. We got some house calls to make. How long do you think until we see this, Sarge? Well, the longer the better. One day out's too close. But we'll see. Why aren't we looking for Kennedy? 'Cause Doc wants us to see it. And Kennedy's gone, Manning. You let her go. - I tried to stop her. - Good job. You gotta have hope, man. She could be out there. She could be alive. She could. Nothing matters. Stop saying that. Just like he said, we're all gonna die. Just like your mother. - Stop, stop, stop it! - You stand down. Look at me, Manning. Look at me, son. You're not my father. Blood or not, the last six years with all of you does matter. That goes for you, too. Now stand down. It's not dangerous enough out there? We gotta deal with this sh-- Get it off! Come on! They're infected! Black eyes! They're infected! - Get off! - Sarge! Move, come on! The other side. Shoot three! All right, I'm done. Dutra, stop it! I'm useless. We gotta step things up. - I'm not going back. - You're coming back. I'm not giving Dero the satisfaction. We finish this job and I take care of myself. Can I get you some coffee, Doc? I haven't run the full test yet, but your well's showing positive. Bullshit. This is because of the fracking site. You both need to be tested. And we all know what those tests will show. And how do we know that, Rory? Because you evicted that couple for no reason. And you don't seem interested in a solution. You're not taking us out of this house. Are we infected? My baby? The only way, Toni, to know for sure-- No goddamn way. Outside, Dero. I need to run blood work on your wife, Rory. On the baby. Rory, please. What are you really looking for? There's more going on concerning the baby. Dero, what's going on in there? Let's talk. What's going on in there? Where's Toni? - Let's take a walk. - Toni. You mind? Come on. Don't have all day. You know something? This is the reason why you can't be one of us. You're scared and you're weak. You know that, right? You finished? Don't touch me. Right here. Well? Just have one question to ask you. Answer yes or no. You that kid's father? Grab his weapons. Mount up. Move! Come on, guys! Move! You're not coming back, Sarge? Manning, you're in charge. You get back and let 'em know. You get out, son. All right? Hold them off as long as you can, but you get out. We've been training for this all our lives. Yeah, but nothing's gonna stop that. Gentlemen, we are gonna die. That is a fact. It is simply a question... ...of choosing how. Now it has been a pleasure and an honor training you and serving with you. Die fighting, not on your knees. Adios. Welcome to the suck. Thought you said you couldn't do an amniocentesis. I lied. There's something in there with him. Well, what? What's in there? I don't know. Nikki, can you give us a moment? Wait. I'll be right outside. In a normal world, the fact that your baby is not infected gives hope, hope that we could reproduce as a race with little fear of infection. Even the possibility of developing some kind of placental vaccine. Why are you saying it like this? I was a GP, Toni. I barely have the knowledge let alone the equipment to do what I do. There's no way I could make some kind of magic bullet - even if I wanted to. - Doc-- Listen, you and Rory have to leave. You are evicting us? You are killing us. We're all dead. Elwood is a hospice. It's my job to ease my patients' fears. That means keeping them comfortable till the end. No! Hey! This isn't about evicting you to save us. We're all done. We can still evacuate, Doc. We have the weapons and vehicles and food! We will hold things together as long as we can. Give them the choice, Dero. Let's go. Don't do this. We still have time! Things fall apart. Right there. What's it gonna be? Do it. You like playing that tough guy, don't you? Always having something clever to say. How's it feel to know that your tongue might work on her... ...but your kid? That ain't your kid. How's it feel to know that? How's that feel to have that be the last thing you're ever gonna hear? Dero, please. Okay, boss. Get the baby. We have to get you back to Doc's. There's gotta be some way that we can get out of the fence later. Something... - Please. - Please what? Get-- don't let him-- Don't let him die. Toni, I don't-- I don't have any equipment or painkillers. And even if I did, I don't know how to do a procedure like-- Ian, it's me. Are you there? Nikki, it's me. What's wrong? Where are you? Are you close? I've been stabbed. I'm bleeding out. I'm at the fence line. I need to know how to get in. What gateway? Five. No, no, no, six. You can't go-- Ian! Ian! God damn it. Dutra! No, no, no, no, no! We've reached the end stage, gentlemen. I want it all to be done before Seiler and his team get back. I always hoped I'd be gone before this day came. Sure aren't paintball guns in there. You able to do this quickly? You mainly? Ian, bite check her. You're gonna be okay. - Go, go, go, go. Hang in there. - I gotta get her to Doc's. Nikki. You saw 'em? They're headed this way? Yeah. I'm all set. So is Elwood. Shooting me's a lot better than what's coming for all of us. That's why I took care of things. You've known me since I was a boy. You've helped take care of my mom. I know you think we're screwed, but let me decide that for myself. Clear under the stitch. No infection. She's ready. You need to get out of here. We're gonna leave all together. Then do it now. Good morning, Mr. Slater. How's Nikki? He'll be okay. He will one day. He'll be okay. I know, baby. You didn't have much of a childhood, either, did you, sweetheart? Things fell apart so early. But I'll bet there were some things you still got away with that I didn't know about. I never had to hide anything from you. I just want you to know I'll always be loving you. I'll always be protecting you. And I'll always be guiding you from up there, okay? Okay, we need to do this now. I can't. You don't want to, but you have to. Where are the others? Should be up at base. Get there, get them, and get out. Commit to the Lord, whatever he wants you to commit. Maybe it's your calling. Maybe it's a stronger commitment to the church. Whatever it is, commit. Doc! Doc! Doc, stop! What are you doing? I drove out. Walking from here. To where? To them. No, no, I found help. There's others. And there's a chopper, okay? They've come to help us. We've got a chance. The wave's already broken through. Elwood's done. But we don't have to be, okay? Come with us. They have a chopper and we can get everybody and we can get out of here. I have things to answer for, Kennedy. - No. - Listen. If you can make it back to my lab, there's notes. I figured some things out. Might be useful. I just didn't have the means. Maybe your friends do. Doc. Doc! Doc! Living fire begets cold, impotent ash. We gotta move. They're moving faster. They'll be here soon. Load this truck up. Yeah, what then? - Ian! - You're gonna be okay. Yeah, if we can ever get out of Elwood. He killed Rory and Toni. Well, everyone's all here together. You're making this too easy. What's the point? I made a promise to Doc. You wanna kill shit? Let's kill those things. How you doing, sweetheart? Buy your girlfriend an hour. Zombie killers, ooh. I see you. They're coming! They're coming! - Let's get a move on, guys. - Collin, out of the tree. Let's do this. What are you doing? - Ian, let's go now. - Stoller. I need you to get them out of here. What? No! You're coming with us. You have to come. Go! Go to Doc's. Clean out everything. - Come on, kid, let's go. - I'm not going without you. - I'll be right behind you. - No, I'm not-- - Ian, see you down at Doc's. - Ian! Are you gonna man up and kick ass? We still have time to go. Go where? There's nothing left out there. It's in the water. It's everywhere. I was born here. I'm gonna die here. It's my choice. You can go if you want. Here it comes. Smoke 'em up, Dutra. Up top, boys! It would be so easy to give up and quit, but God wants us to keep on fighting and stay in the game. Man will let you down. But God will always, always come through! Watch your back! Ian, your 6:00! Hey, Ian, I'll handle that thing for you! Manning, let's go. Whoa. Whoo! Come on, big boy. Whoo! Hey, who are these people? Ugh! Gas tank! Watch the gas tank! Hey, slow down! Slow down! Oh, shit! Hey, hey, slow down, Ian. Ian, slow down! Let's-- let's get out of here, man. Life goes by while we wait to live. It's not so wrong to wait to die, to go quietly into the dark without incident, without fear, just resignation that all that could be done was done. Zombie killers, baby. Looks like we were expected. Yeah, who are they? Same guys that dropped in on us back in Elwood. You sure about this, Dutra? Positive. You finally caught up with us. Who's in charge here? What? You blondie? You've gotta be shitting me. He's not. Oh, easy there, lad. Lower your gun. We are on your side. Lower your gun, soldier. Or shoot. Go ahead. You'd be doing me a great favor. You see, I'm infected. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Good man! I'd have done the same thing. Infected. Welcome. It's not much. But it's good for the research. Come along. Five iron. It really is the best club in the bag. What research? Yeah, what's down there? Hope. Hope in hell. Nice work back in Elwood. Youse aren't the only ones that found value in paintball. We've been developing a suppressor for the protozoa. You found a cure? Not a cure. It stops the little bastards, but they're still inside you, but... ...injected in these... ...and you have a surefire killer better than bullets. He's lying.
