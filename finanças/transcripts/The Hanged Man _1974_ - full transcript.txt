[Dramatic music] There's a lot more to hangin' a body than most people think. Could you step down please? Oh, this is my son. 'I'm teaching him the trade.' 'fill it more.' There, that oughta do her. And I'm much obliged to you, sir. See you tomorrow. 'Bright and early.' 'oh, the hood..' ...can place the rope over it or under it. You have a preference? Help yourself. We don't have to go to this Plaza if you'd rather not. It doesn't matter. He'll do up real nice, son. Real nice. (Josiah) 'I had the stone set here when it arrived from Santa fe.' I hope you approve. It's clean and straight forward. Like George himself. He misses his father, so.. Well, that surely is understandable. 'I share your loss, Carrie.' I considered him my friend as well as his lawyer. You've been such a help these past few months since George's accident. I'm glad. I'm so glad. Would you like a moment alone? Thank you. Benjamin, let's, let's go this way. (Benjamin) 'Why are some people buried out there?' that's, uh, that's parrot's field out there. Benjamin, that-that's where we Bury unfortunates and paupers. Do you-do you know what paupers are Benjamin? No. Well, paupers are people that don't have much money and sometimes they, they don't have many friends. You think it's for that killer they're hanging tomorrow? Yes, that's, that's where they're gonna put him 'right there.' (Benjamin) I've never been to a hanging. Mother might let you take me. We'll be on the stage for home. Besides, you know how I feel about executions. There's some good in every man and killing him kills that too. Forgive me... what you said, Carrie, is quite true certainly of James devlin. I defended him at the trial and I'm not certain justice has done. You mean he might be innocent? Innocent of this crime, yes. There were ample evidence of self defense. Well, then why wasn't he set free? Of his reputation, I'd suppose, as you know devlin was a notorious gun fighter. His.. His reputation convicted him. [Dramatic music] Hey, devlin, I got money on you tomorrow. I bet judge stoke you gonna crack like an egg. 'I'm talking to you devlin.' if you lived a rotten life, then all that's got you is a rotten death. When you feel that rope around your neck oh, you're gonna give US a dandy show crying beggin' for mercy. Till they put that gunny sack on your head and drop you through that trapdoor to hell. Why don't you shut up, Eubie? Don't you disappoint me, devlin. I got 50 cents ridin'. Go back to your drinking, Eubie. [Laughing] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Music continues] Did you search her good? Sure, I know my business. She bring your supper. Did you go through this too? You think she might have hidden a derringer in the tamale? Happened once, with a few extra bullets in the salsa. Hey. Judge gave me permission to visit with him.. ...alone. Any words from charman? Charman won't be coming. Now, what's gone wrong? He promised me he'd break me out of here before last night. He was killed down in Goshan. Well, he sure picked a time. [Laughing] Well, at least I'll have somebody to share the fire with. Devlin, you can't give up hope. Charman was my last one. Well, maybe I could do something else. Oh, forget it. Forget it, querida. Forget me. Oh, no. No, never. Oh, I know you. You'll mourn me till day after tomorrow and then swap my horse for a ticket to Abilene. Not Abilene, New Orleans. And sell my guns too for that new bonnet that I never got around to buyin' you. Well, Josiah, did you come to collect your fee? Jim, I just received this from the governor. He refuses to Grant you clemency. [Speaking in foreign language] Isn't there's something else you can do? He's no murderer. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. The lady is leaving too. Tomorrow...don't be there. [Laughing] Slicker than a barrel of grease. (Male #1) 'I know I how you feel devlin.' there's only one way out. I am father Alvaro. Soledad asked you to come, didn't she? She worries for your soul. Well, you're wasting your time, it's already spoken for. I brought you this Bible. If I may suggest a passage from the Corinthian which proves in words more eloquent than mine, that 'that our soul is not lost...' don't sell me. I'm not buying. - You reject salvation? - No. Just the partnership. Surely, you must feel some remorse. Well, I'll answer for my sins on my feet not on my knees like some death-bed Christian. But if you would only repent. If I'd played my cards better if I hadn't gone to the war, if I hadn't lost my family. If I hadn't been good with a gun tonight I'd be an upright Kansas farmer worrying about tomorrow's weather. Do not despair. You were gonna save my son. If you had padre or no padre I'd have thrown you out. I'm sorry. I will go. No, you are not a bad priest, father. You haven't failed me. Perhaps an older, wiser man. Oh, forget it, forget it, my life's a bucket of spilled milk. What I need tonight is good company. Come on, sit down. 'I'll tell you your fortune.' those are the tarot. That's right, I got 'em from a woman in chihuahua she taught me to read 'em. I saved her from being stolen for witch craft. - Your life is being eventful. - Yeah, it has at that. Now, there are four suits. Wands, cups, swords and pentacles. - Superstition. - Well, what isn't? Still they deal with the same things that you do. The world, the devil, judgment, death. But the meaning isn't necessarily what you'd think. Now you take this one for example. [Speaking in foreign language] The hanged man. This one turned up when my future was read. But the meaning isn't that I'll hang. No, sir, that card foretells a man changing his way of life by surrendering to a higher being. Now, how's that for snake oil? You mock me. No. Myself. Come on. Cut the cards, we'll see what your future holds. May be even that call to Rome and.. Those cardinal's robes you dream of wearing someday. How-how did you know that? Lucky guess. No. Not three times tonight. Who knows? Cut 'em. [Bell tolling] It's time. God willing, he won't suffer. He won't feel much. I gave him enough laudanum to subdue half the tigers in Bengal. But was that, uh.. Proper? No, merciful. I hate to think of you stuck way out there in the middle of nowhere. Why don't you reconsider my advice and sell the mine? Not to Lew Halleck or anyone. Well, if that scoundrel gives you anymore trouble we'll get a marshal after him. Come on, Benjamin. Ah, boy, you're a heavy one. You come back, Benji, we'll teach you how to ride a horse. Okay. - Thank you for everything. - Goodbye, dear. Take good care of yourself. Bye-bye. Can't we go watch too? No! - But, mom... - Benjamin. It's not a circus! [Dramatic music] [Music continues] [Music continues] Your honor. Ready, judge. Mr. Devlin, it's customary to say a few words 'of remorse or..' 'maybe an admonition to the young folk of the town.' in your own words if you'd be so kind. [Speaking in foreign language] James devlin, you have been found guilty by a jury of your peers. 'And you have been sentenced to hang by the neck' 'until you're dead.' carry out the sentence. "Blessed are the poor in spirit "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. '"Blessed are the meek, for they so possess the land.' '"blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.' "blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice "for they shall have their fill. "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the clean in heart for they shall see god." Hey, devlin, welcome to the dance. You're gonna show US the strangulation jig? [Laughing] "Behold, I tell you a mystery, we shall all indeed rise again. '"In a moment..' "...in the twinkle of an eye "at the last trumpet, for the trumpet shall sound '"and the dead shall rise again incorruptible' '"and we shall be changed' '"for this corruption must put on incorruption' 'and this mortal must put on immortality."' [Speaking in foreign language] [Praying in foreign language] [Screams] [Speaking in foreign language] [Screaming] No! No! [Instrumental music] You live. 'You live!' [music continues] Whoa! Look mother. Smoke! [Horses whining] [Dramatic music] Welcome home, my lady. [Groaning] Dirty devils! That's Betsy Ross. Benjamin, go in the house. Go on and close the door. Oh.. Go on now. [Music continues] Nameless. No, don't touch me. Them dirty devils they, they jumped me. - Let me help you. - No, don't touch me. They befouled, they soiled me. - That don't matter. - No, no, my lady. Just a minute. No.. Animals! Animals. Doctor? Do you have any explanation? (Lawrence) 'Explanation?' 'well, his neck's not broken, he's unable to talk or won't.' he's heart is steady, pulse slow body temperature is abnormally cold outside of that.. Do you think he'll live, doctor? If he should, will the state execute him again? (Josiah) 'I don't know.' I imagine the same uncertainty is praying on his mind too. If indeed his.. '...brain is functioning.' (Josiah) 'Confounded, man. How could this happen?' you signed his death certificate. He was dead. Or you were drunk? Or the hang man misplaced his knot or.. Or they cut him down to soon, who knows? Perhaps, the answer lies beyond our understanding. A miracle? God, in a moment of mercy. God in a moment of mercy reached out and a sinner fell in his palm? Really, father. Really.. Why not? [Instrumental music] [Music continues] That's it. Finish it up. [Music continues] [Mumbling] Uh, mustn't try to talk yet. Oh! I can't. Now, now, the girl's distraught. 'I suppose others will be too' 'you have to be prepared for that.' [Music continues] [Music continues] "What did Lazarus do with the rest of his life?" The Bible does not say. You must find your own answer. You keep this incredible thing secret for two whole days then you wanna tell me about it, why? Well, it's Devlin's idea. He insists on knowing what's next. I explained to him that to the best of my knowledge this case is legally completely without precedent. But if this is any kind of a prank I'd hate to be in your boots. You certainly didn't exaggerate. An execution was carried out before some 300 witnesses. Jo, this man is legally dead. Legally dead. That-that doesn't mean that you're safe. You've got enemies. There ought to be some who'll wanna test your mortality here in tres cruces or any place else you go. Now, as your friend, I think we should go ahead and Bury James devlin. We'll spirit you away. Another name, another place. And you will be reborn. No. [Music continues] [Music continues] [Dog barking] [Whimpering] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Gunshots] [Music continues] [Thinking] "Behold I tell you a mystery. "We shall all indeed rise again in a moment "in a twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet "for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again "incorruptible and we shall all be changed "for this corruption must put on incorruption this mortal must put on immortality." Why? Why? Why? [Echoing] Why? [Echoing] Why? [Echoing] God! [Goats bleating] Long, short and Benjamin. Long, long.. - Where is water? - Who are you? - Nobody. - You one of Halleck's men? Now, son, don't be afraid. [Screams] [Gun shots] It bit me, it bit me! [Sobbing] Damn snake bit me. Nah, you're gonna be alright. But it's poison. It's poison, I'm gonna die. No, you're not. - Look at this. - I'm gonna die. - Hold this and squeeze tight. - Die. Die. Just concentrate. It won't hurt at all. Squeeze. Atta-boy. 'Doing just fine.' now, if you trust me then squeeze. You won't feel a thing. Tighter. Tighter. You got nothing to worry about. [Panting] Put him on my bed. Mama. You got whiskey? To clean the wound. Oh, won't carbolic do as well? That's better. Just, wash it and bind it tightly. If you got paregoric it will settle him down. Don't go. Benjamin, what am I gonna do about you? There's always something. That man scared me. [Sighs] I'm sure he didn't mean to. (Nameless) 'Alright, get in there, get in with you there.' 'come on. Get in, get in.' there you go. Alright, thank you, sir. Is the boy alright? He should be. You got water? Well, I think so but be sparing with it. Every drop is precious as pearls. The mine play out? That is no concern of yours. No, I guess not. Fourteen men here on this payroll and when the trouble started every men jacked up and runs like rabbits 'leaving the poor little lady all alone.' no. You don't know them devils like I do. I know they'd win. They.. [Horses galloping] [Dramatic music] Ms. Gault. I've come here to have a talk with you. You're wasting your time, Mr. Halleck. My answer is still no. The chupadera is not for sale. That's not why I've come. - Then why? - Why? To express my regrets about that unfortunate misunderstanding the other day. I was shocked when I learned about it. That was no misunderstanding. Oh.. You mean the old man deliberately provoked my employees by taking a shot at 'em? Your employees were trespassing. I admonish them for that. And for killing three goats and burning my wagon and abusing this man. (Lew) 'They went too far.' and I fell, uh, moral obligation to at least pay damages. Well, I don't want your money. I wanna be left alone. You're abandoned. 'Almost.' he's just passing through. Now, if you'll excuse me. 'Ms. Gault.' I know this property can be a great burden. 'Specially to a widow with a young child' 'to consider, so..' ...I'm gonna keep my offer open to buy it.. ...for seven days. Good day to you, ma'am. Oh, my dear lady. Don't you think it's best for you and for your boy's sake 'that you take up this offer?' nameless. After all we've been through? No, I can't let it end Halleck's way. Sure, but I've tried my best. I know. I wanna thank you for what you did for Benjamin. Uh, you're welcome to take supper with US and put up for the night. (Lew) 'Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!' Billy, do something. Short of murder. [Dramatic music] Hey, chief, that drifter I seen him the last time you sent me into tres cruces. He's the one. - Devlin? - The hangman. You don't talk much, do ya? That's right. You can bed yourself down here. Say, did you ever know Luke Parmentier? There was a bad one for ya. And I have known a lot of devils in my day. Indian Joe Murray? Bow leg Pete? Come to think of it the worst of 'em was the nicest with the children. And also the bad ones were the most gentlemen like with the ladies. Ah, maybe it's the roughs that you don't have to worry about. Maybe. What's that? What's wrong? I got dog's ears I don't hear anything. [Explosion] Thought you'd have gone by now. Sometimes I feel there's no lonelier place on earth. I've even found myself conjuring up visitors. Marco Polo. Omar Khayyam. Omar, is practical. Those tents need repairing. He won't tell anyone his name. - I haven't heard yours. - Does it matter? Oh, he's never gonna be able to fix that thing by himself. Uh, I don't suppose you.. What? Be interested in a job? No. Well, I couldn't pay much anyway. Besides, why should you borrow someone else's trouble? That's no fight you could hope to win. Not alone, no. But my brother's coming soon. He's a mining engineer. He knows how to deal with men like Lew Halleck. I've worked for men like halleck. Cattleman, railroad Maybobs. They never stop till they win. And what's in front of 'em gets ground under. Yes, well.. 'Come in, I'll fix you some food for the trail.' maybe you'll ride a ways with me. I gotta go into town. You think that's wise? We can't do without water. Nearest water is in goshen. It ain't poison. Pure. 'Bet your life.' that's not your ordinary gargle and spit. That's swallowin' water. Yes, sir. Purity is quality. - For a price. - Everything's bloomin'. Is that a stamp mill down there? 'Stamp mill, smelter too.' 'goin' 24 hours a day' including Sunday, thanks to Lew Halleck. He a top man? Puts bread on a lotta tables. Gravy on salmon. - Devlin. - Yeah? Billy irons. You might have heard the name. You are young. Old enough to rode with kingfish down there in tres cruces. You've been to a lot of places too, huh? All this stuff here for the.. ...widow lady? Widow? Meaning the Gault woman? He didn't tell me that, Mr. Irons. Yeah. (Billy) Halleck, wants to see ya. He's curious. You blame him? Ride down there to the smelter. I'll unload his wagon while you're gone, Mr. Irons. Leave it. Thank you. Thank you kindly, Mr. Devlin. [Dramatic music] Whoa! - 'Private police?' - 'Security force.' guard against thieves and trespassers. Over half a million dollars worth of silver passes through here in a month. Get over to the pay masters and we'll leave the guard over there. - Sure thing, Mr. Halleck. - Chief. - Hold it. - Chief. Yeah. Devlin. Devlin, ha, ha, ha. Well, well.. I wanna hire you before p.T. Barnum does. [Laughing] 'It's all mine.' 'every last brick.' 'every last board.' says there you got a partner. Yeah, he's like you. Dead. As soon as I'm through my period of mourning. Why, we're gonna rub his name out. Come on, let's have a look. Devlin, ha, ha. Mornin', Samo. You know how many tons of this we process a day? Twenty three hundred. Now, most of it's from my own property. But I also handle the output of the major independents. The black hat. The groot brothers. See the next nearest mill is over a hundred miles away. So, uh, they gotta bring the ore to me. Right now, I got two hundred and sixteen men on the payroll. Good mornin'. Men like these. Welshman. Cousin Jacks. But let me tell ya. Compared to the mine they were born to this is like heaven. Looks more like hell. You ought to know. Come on. Heat bother ya? Ha. Not me. Oh, I guess I ruin a.. ...couple of shirts a day. You know that Gault widow? She's, uh, very handsome lady. Man would have to notice that, huh? Tell me, devlin. - What's she payin' ya? - All I want. You don't understand, devlin. I mean to hire you. I don't like you. Lots of people don't. I still do business with them. I don't like your way of doing. Well, a man can't eat the walnuts unless he cracks a few shells. Now, your first chore is to convince the Gault woman smartest thing she can do is sell out 'cause I'm sure you got a kinder way of doin', then, uh.. ...Billy irons. She's waitin' for the water. Water? She can have all the water she needs. All. But I mean to have the chupadera. Well, at least he didn't harm you. Mr. Halleck's playing some kind of a game. I think he's gonna tire of it very soon. You think I should sell out? Chupadera means nothing to you. But to me it's my.. ...my husband's dream. My son's birth right. And all I have in the world. Your brother when does he get here? Early next month. Halleck gonna give you seven days. I won't ask you to stay. You may not want me to. Good morning. Howdy? My father always let me watch. Those were his. 'There's one for every day.' 'they'll be mine when I grow up.' yeah? You didn't use today's. Yeah, Friday's had the best edge. Take a good look. Does it still hurt? Some. Will it ever go away? No. How come god let my daddy die? And you live? Ah, this is nothin'. I fought the Chapultepec with winfield Scott. I sails harpoonist on the whaler, "Diana" under captain Oliver Slokum. Uh, there was a mean devil for ya. [Dramatic music] The back of me neck is prickling too. Just like that time when I found George Gault lying dead there at the foot of the mesa. Was that an accident? - Maybe. - Or halleck? Well, they couldn't prove it so I keep the suspicions to myself, and you do likewise for the sake of that sweet little lady's peace of mind. Apple. Looks more like a miracle. [Chuckles] Well, it's nothing really. I ran short of dried apples and had to fill out with soda crackers. But the taste is the thing. Now, I'm sure other women have baked you much better. Not for some time. Well, don't you go casting your eye on it till supper. Devlin, devlin! Devlin... will you put a mister on that? Mr. Devlin, there are some men riding up the back way. [Dramatic music] Looks like it might be ed Culbertson the groot brothers, mine owners. They fighting halleck too? [Horses neighing] Culbertson? No doubt who you are. I'm a plain-spoken man, devlin. And so I'm coming straight out with what we're after. Our mine's shut down too. Halleck's got a strangled hold on US. And we'll pay you two hundred dollars to break it. How? We leave that up to you. You tell me. You know. I don't have to say it. Yes, you do. Kill halleck. Well, what's it to you? A man with your reputation. You've killed before. I've been killed too. [Music continues] [Gunshot] [Gunshots] (James) 'Benji?' we're alright. [Music continues] Why're you telling me this? The law was broken. Sure. Out of the chupadera. My authority ends with the town limits. But I'll pass along your report to the federal Marshall.. ...next time he passes through. Thank you. I hear there's a death certificate made out in your name. Don't think that puts you beyond the law. Get out of line and I'll see you march back up them 13 steps. You're gonna take care of him, Billy? When the chief says. [Humming] Who is it? Oh, you. How'd you get in here? Have a drink. Your men could have killed a woman and a boy today. Uh-huh. Today, yesterday, last month. Any time I want. - 'So?' - so it stops. [Laughing] Devlin, pour yourself a drink. We'll talk it over. Work something out. You just listen to me. Harm Carrie Gault or her mine just once more.. ...and I'm comin' after you. You personally silver king and I won't stop until you're are out of business for good. Believe that. [Snaps finger] Hand me my robe. My robe! I'm not scared of you. Who the hell do you think you are? You're, you're the same two bit gunman you were before they stretched your neck. You're not some avenging angel and I got two dozen men to prove that whenever I.. [Snaps fingers] ...Snap my fingers. You're flesh and blood. You're flesh and blood. Touch me. [Growling] Janney! Janney! Joe Janney! Who's on duty here? Somebody! - Hey, chief. What's the matter? - Where's Billy irons? Well, him and some of the boys are riding after the chupadera like you said. Go after him. Stop him. - Yeah, but you just told... - I changed my mind. Tell him I called it off for tonight. Tell him! Move! - Okay. - Move! Damn it! [Explosion] (Carrie) 'Oh! Oh! Oh, god!' oh! Oh! 'No, no, please stop.' 'stop, please! Stop!' 'no, don't do it! Aah!' [Gunshot] 'Oh, please..' 'no! No!' [Carrie screams] Oh, please, help me! Please don't! No! [Indistinct shouting] Oh, god! Oh, please help me, god! Help me! [Dramatic music] There's some liquor in my saddle bag. And don't let the boy come in. Hey.. ...not so good, eh? No. Tobin. Shawn r. Tobin. That your name? On my gravestone. Tell me. What's it like? 'Tell me.' you've been there. Yes. I'm scared...Of dyin'. Are you scared of livin'? Hell, no! You, you made lots of friends. You worked hard. You've sailed the ocean. You've seen the elephant. I've done more than that. I found the elephant and after I seen him I ate him. I sucked the marrow from out of his bones. And go brave. You've got nothin' to be afraid of. Shawn "ray" Tobin. You won't forget? No, I won't. Sew him a shroud. If only I hadn't been so stubborn. Don't. 'Don't.' there's only one doorstep this belongs on. You're not going after halleck. Yes. But he has an army. 'Why you?' because I can. It's my trade. You can't go back to that! Not after god's given you a second chance. Maybe there's no such thing as a second chance. You're alive! What if I'm not? Maybe this is my hell. Or my purgatory. You're gonna deliver a message. You're the one who gave the order. I don't care what I gave. If you hadn't been in such a hurry I could have stopped ya, no, no. Devlin isn't bluffin'. No matter what you think. No, that ain't what I'm thinkin'. What's the matter with you? Devlin said to tell you he's comin'. 'Sun up.' alone? His eyes, the touch of him. God! Well, boy, let's spread the welcome mat. You don't understand. He's coming to get ya. He ain't.. Well...He ain't hardly human. What do you need? A sniff of smelling salts? Mr. Irons, he said to ask... what are you standing here for? Billy, I want your men up and armed everyone within 10 minutes. How many you figure it's gonna take to punch Devlin's ticket? One. Just one. And the one who gets him gets himself a $100 bounty, you tell 'em. Spread the word. Go on! Move! Mr. Irons. What? Uh, devlin said to ask you.. Say it. If the pay is worth the price? He ought to know. It never is. Well, the sun's up. He ain't comin'. A man would have to be crazy to go up against this many guns. Maybe dyin' is like killin'. The second time's easier. Somethin' out there, Mr. Halleck. Remember, a hundred dollars to the man that gets him. 'Remember that.' [guns cocking] [Dramatic music] [Gunshots] [Gunfire continues] [Music continues] Dynamite.. Get out! Get out from there! [Coughing] Billy irons. Here! His name was Shawn r. Tobin. And you're gonna meet him. Aah! [Dramatic music] [Wind gushing] Aah! [Coughing] Aah! Go away. Go away! Ah! Go away! No! Aah! We want you to have these. To remember US. I've got other things of my dad's. Wednesday needs sharpening. You do. I hope you find whatever you're looking for. Well, you've helped, Carrie. Well.. [Instrumental music] But I liked him. [Dramatic music] You. You seen anything here abouts of a man called devlin? You a friend of his? We've got unfinished business. He headed south. But, mister, let me tell you. There's no use tryin' to get there. No, use.. Mister.. They charged a hanging and they couldn't kill him. He blown up the smelter. And he outdrawed Billy irons. [Music continues] [Music continues] [Music continues] [Music continues]
