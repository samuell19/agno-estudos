Station. Aft? 800 pounds light, sir. Forward? 1,200 pounds light, sir. Up ship. Up ship! Hello, Macon? Hello, Macon. Hello. Sunnyvale. Macon calling. What is your position, Macon? We're 110 miles south of San Francisco. 10 miles off point sur lighthouse. Can we make our landing at sunnyvale? Wind velocity here is 60 miles an hour. Storm increasing. You cannot land. Stand by, sunnyvale. Wind velocity 60 at sunnyvale, sir. We cannot land. Think we can ride out the storm, sir? We've got a motto aboard this ship. "It shall be done." Tell sunnyvale we'll ride out the storm and await instructions to land. Yes, sir. Hello. Sunnyvale. Macon calling. Hello, Macon. Storm is heading your way and gale increasing. Think you can make it? Captain Tisdale reports we'll ride out the storm and await your instructions to land. Ok, Macon. Good luck. Can you hold it, Austin? Try, sir. Let me give you a hand. Hold it! Upper fin carried away, sir. Stand by. Stand by. Can you get the nose down? Seems jammed, sir. But it shall be done. Stand by to drop all ballast aft. Yes, sir. Pass the word along. Stand by fuel tanks. Yes, sir. Let go all ballast aft. Yes, sir. Stand by fuel tanks. Release all gasoline, oil, water. Clothes, everything of weight. And order the men forward to help weigh the nose down. Release all gasoline, oil, water, clothing. Anything of weight. Order men forward to help weigh nose down. She all clear? Yeah. Come on. I'll take it. Come on, men, up forward. Help weigh the nose down. Hurry up, now. Step on it! 3 aft sails carried away, sir. Altitude... 4,000. 3,900. 3,800. Radio flagship. Casualty and position. We're dropping pretty fast, sir. How much? About 500 feet a minute. Stand by for crash. Stand by for a crash. Altitude... 1,200. 1,100. Stand by to reverse motors. Prepare to abandon ship. Prepare to abandon ship. I'll take the wheel. Put on your life belt. I'm standing by, sir. Reverse motors. Abandon ship! The Macon has crashed, sir. What? Order all ships to location of crash and stand by to pick up survivors. Aye aye, sir. Everyone's clear. Let's go, Austin. Good luck, sir. Same to you. Thanks for standing by. Look out for wreckage below. Aye, sir. Bravo, Bill. The leg looks fine. Oh, thank you, sir. I'll call her Peggy, sir, but like any other woman, I don't know yet just what she'll stand. I'll wheel the chair, nurse. I want to talk to Bill. Don't bother, sir. Only yesterday, I won the wheeling contest in the hospital here. Won by 10 feet from the best wheelchair man in the place. Watch me. Wait a minute, Bill. Don't you think you're doing too much? This is the best part of the ride. Let me help you with that. Well, here we are. That was fun. Oh, by the way, sir, I heard they had you up before the board of inquiry. Yes, they had to try to ascertain the cause of the wreck of the Macon. Surely they can't try to pin that on you. They couldn't very well expect you to walk out there and hold that tail fin on, could they? No. But I came here to talk about you, Bill. They're going to give you a medal. They giving you one, sir? In a few years, most people will have forgotten that you stuck by your post beyond line of duty. I won't. I can't give you a medal. I know you wouldn't take money. But I wanted to give you something that will chart your course the tough job you have ahead of you. I hope it will never hear you say "I'm licked." The words have always helped me. I want them to help you. Thank you, sir. Sorry, men. Job's taken. Load truck 4. Howdy, mister. Would you be interested in hiring a man who knows lumber from logs to shingles? Sorry, friend, no jobs open. Well, thanks just the same. 400... Beg your pardon, mister. But I'm the best lumber salesman... going to have to try the office. They turned me down there, sir. Thanks just the same. Cards printed here. Cards printed while you wait. Letterhead, stationery, and envelopes printed while you wait, folks. Print you 100 business cards for 6 bits, mister. Haven't got a business, mister. Then fool your friends. I'll print anything for 6 bits. You never know what a big shot you are until you see it printed in black and white. For 6 bits, I'll make you president of the United States. Then how about that company across the street? I'll make you president of that on 100 cards for 6 bits. I'll take 100 of those cards, mister. That's a boy. What's the name? William Austin. Will you have it for the lumber or the navigation company? Lumber. William Austin, representing the Ricks lumber and logging company. Would you mind putting a little slogan on that? No. What'll it be? "If you can drive nails in it, we have it." Ok. I'll have that set up in just a minute. "William Austin"? I never heard of him. What's he want? He says it's important to the future of the company, Mr. Skinner. Hmm. Tell him to wait a minute. Yes, sir. Mr. Skinner said to wait a minute. Thank you. Margaret, I want to talk to you. What about? Sit down and I'll tell you. It's about your father. What's he done now? He's using his office again. Seeing as he built this building and this business, you can't begrudge his sitting in his office. If he'd just sit there, we wouldn't protest, but he should be sitting in a rocking chair instead of interfering with the progress of the company. He's done pretty well for 40 years. Then why did he put me in charge of the lumber company? Why did he put Peasely in charge of navigation? Because we're young and he's getting old. What did he do? Yesterday he bought 1/2 million feet of skunk spruce, and we haven't sold 1,000 feet in 3 years. What'd he do that for? Said that it was his good turn for the day and the man he bought it from was an old friend of his, down on his luck. That sounds just like dad. Yes, but it doesn't sound like a good way to run a lumber business. Today is no day for sentimentalities. If a man can't swim, let him sink. What do you want me to do about it? Margaret. You know I love you. You know I wouldn't advise you wrongly. Urge your father to go away on a trip. A long trip. Tell him there's a new field of lumber to be developed in central Africa. Tell him anything that'll keep him away for at least a year before he ruins the business. Beg your pardon, sir. What do you mean by this interruption? Your secretary told me to wait a minute, then left the room. The minute's up. So is my patience. What branch of the company do you work for? I'm going to sell lumber for you. That's my selling motto. "If you can drive nails in it, we've got it." When do I start to work? If I hadn't noticed you were a cripple, I'd have you thrown out of my office for this impertinence. I'm going to sell lumber with my brains, not my feet. I'd appreciate a chance. Get out. Skinner! Come to my office at once. This gives you a small idea what I have to put up with. What you have to put up with? Come here immediately! What are you waiting for? I told you to get out. I'll see you this evening, Margaret. Skinner, are you coming in or aren't you? I say... Ah. Nincompoops. Scoundrels! Flea-bitten nitwits. Ha ha! And you, too! What's wrong today, your rheumatism come back? Can the sarcasm, young man. You know doggone well I haven't any rheumatism. It's the fact that in my old age I'm totally and completely surrounded by the choicest aggregation of mental duds since ajax defied the lightning. Meaning whom? Meaning you, for one. Now what have I done? Henderson has absconded from the Shanghai office with the company bank account. And you're blaming me for that? I haven't been in Shanghai for 5 years. I didn't call you in here for any alibis. Then permit me to remind you, Mr. Ricks, that Henderson was bonded to the extent of 1/4 million dollars. Not a peep out of you, Skinner. Not one peep. And permit me to remind you that I'm the little genius that placed that insurance, unknown to you. And you request that I stop interfering in the internal administration of your office. I still don't see what Henderson has to do with me. Because he worked for you. Because you recommended him. But he was in charge of Peasely's navigation office when he absconded. Huh? So he was. Send in Matt Peasely. Quick! Have you seen Mr. Skinner? Yes, sir, I have. I only handle the shipping end of this organization. Believe me, Mr. Peasely, besides lumbering, I know ships. Ships on the land, in the air, and on plain, everyday water. I don't doubt your word, Mr. Austin. But you see, the truth is, with all the men Cappy Ricks hires, we got more than we need. Yes? Mr. Ricks wants to see you in his office at once, sir. Into the lion's den. Sorry I can't offer you a job. Thank you, sir. Excuse me. Wait a minute, Skinner. I want you here, too. Yes, sir? Peasely, if our shipping business has grown so far beyond US that we can't control it, why don't we sell our freighters? What's wrong now, Cappy? Every infernal young whippersnapper that we send out to that Shanghai office promptly develops a swelled head and thinks that he's divinely ordained to drink up all the synthetic scotch whiskey manufactured in Japan for the benefit of thirsty Americans. In my old age, you two have forced US into the position of having to fire folks by cable. Why? Because we're breaking into a game that can't be played on the home ground. I'm the goat. You've nothing to do with that. You retired 10 years ago. All the troubles in the marine end of this shop belong on my capable shoulders, old settler. Theoretically, yes. Actually, no. I hope you don't expect me to abandon mental as well as physical efforts, Mr. Peasely. Great wampus cat. Am I to be denied a sentimental interest in matters where I have the controlling financial interest? Get to the point, Cappy. Don't rush me. Have you two boobs lost your ability to judge men? Or did you ever have such an ability? Is he referring to Henderson in the Shanghai office? Ask me, not him! Yes, I am. Did you consult me when you sent him out to China on his own? Of course not. I'm the boss at the star navigation company, am I not? Henderson was in charge of the Shanghai office long before you opened your mouth to discharge your cargo of free advice. I told you that Henderson wouldn't make good, didn't I? You did. You sent him out there without giving me a chance to test him, didn't you? I suppose you'd have sent him out to find the blue vase just to find out if he could sell lumber in China. You're darn tootin' I would. And if he'd have found it, he'd have never gotten the swelled head and drunk and gambled and signed checks and beat it with our bank account. Well, when you send a man to the orient, Cappy, you've got to trust him all the way or not at all. There's no use crying over spilled milk, Cappy. Oh, well... Ha. All right, Matt. I won't rub it into you. I admit, you two fellas are handling my affairs, and ordinarily you do it rather well, but I... I'd like to have the privilege of... Testing the next candidate for that Shanghai job myself. You're too late, Cappy. He's already on his way. What? Who did you send? Andrews. Andrews? Why did you send Andrews to that Shanghai job? Because he's been with US long enough to acquire sufficient experience. But has he acquired the courage to tackle the job? That's more important than all the experience that you and Skinner prate so much about. Well, I know nothing about his courage. I assume he has force and initiative. I know he has a pleasing personality. A pleasing personality. So did Henderson. So much so that he spread it on every bar in Shanghai. Andrews is not a drinking man. But will he possess that force and initiative that you yup about when he has to make a quick decision 8,000 miles away from expert advice? Stand or fall by that decision? That's what I want to know. I suggest we wait and see what happens before condemning him. Wait and see? Ha! By the holy pink-toed prophet! We've had 3 managers go rotten on US out there, and that's 3 too many! My name's Austin. I'd like to see Mr. Ricks. Mr. Ricks is busy just now. Be seated, please. Thank you. Did Skinner turn you down, too? Turn me down? Oh. Not exactly. That's probably because you're a woman. His secretary told me she was going to quit, and I don't blame her. Don't you think I could hold down a job like that? Oh, sure. You're much too nice. He needs a battle-ax. Supposing one needs a job and can't choose? I get it, miss. I'm in the same spot myself. Been out of work long? Yeah. 3 months. I'm used to having a steady jobob been long since you worked? I... I suppose so. I, uh... I just sort of help out around the house. Gee, you look nicer than most housemaids. But I don't blame you for wanting to give it up. Even for becoming a secretary to a gorilla like Skinner. Are you waiting to see Mr. Ricks? Yes. Oh, yes. I've promised to get myself a job with this company or bust. But from the sounds coming from the office in there, I'm afraid my luck's not going to change. I've heard that his bark is worse than his bite. Say, would you think it an odd request if I asked you to go to the movies with me? When? Tonight. Well, I... I had a date, but... With the butler? Will you break it? All right. Where shall I meet you? Have you got a notebook? Yeah. 442 Lyon street. And I suppose the Ricks lumber company can just go to pot. About 8:00? Right. I wish he'd let things alone. He probably never will. This world would be all right... She's got a drag, huh? Yes. I heard you shouting, dad, so I came a-runnin'. Those young pups want me to go away. Say I'm too old. Too old! Ha! They're auctioning off those ship models this afternoon. Coming with me? Coming with you? With this business I've given my life to falling to pieces around me? Too old, am I? I'll fire 'em both. I'll run the business myself. Yeah. Buy the models of the southern cross, the flying arrow, and the water witch for me. How high can I go with my bid? As high as you have to. I want them. Your grandfather was the sailing master on them. Dad? There's a young man outside by the name of Austin waiting to see you. I don't want to see anybody. I want to think. Think. I want to fire somebody. Dad. Wouldn't you feel just as good if you hired someone over Lloyd and Matt Peasely's heads? Wouldn't they hire him? Nope. Then it's a sure sign we need him for this dry-rot organization. I'll see him. Good. Is Austin out there? Yes, he is. Very well. Did you get the job? Mm-hmm. I promise you I'll have one before our date tonight. Good luck. Thanks. No tobacco. Why in blazes don't they fill these... Oh. Thanks for granting me an interview, sir. Come in, come in. Come in. Sit down, sit down. Thank you, sir. Well, Mr. Austin, what can I do for you? I've called for my job, sir. You talk like a man who doesn't expect to be refused. The third time's the charm. I don't anticipate a refusal. Why? Because I'm a salesman. First I'm going to sell myself to you. Where'd you sell your leg? Well, I served on the Macon, sir. Losing a leg didn't discourage you? Oh. I got off pretty easy. I can think, and I can write. And even if one of my wheels is flat, I can hike farther and faster after an order than anybody you've got. Got a job for me, sir? I don't think so, Mr. Austin. I retired 10 years ago. I'm out of it. This office, I'm told, is merely a place for me to get my mail. Mr. Skinner's the chap you should see. Give them to me. Send Skinner in. Yes, sir. I've seen Mr. Skinner, sir. I think he jumped to the conclusion that I was trying to trade in my game leg. Well, then, you should see Mr. Peasely. He's the high-low Jack in the game of the shipping end of this business. I have, sir. He was very cordial, but he couldn't give me a job. Well, my dear young fellow, why do you come to me? Because I want you to give me a job. I don't care a hoot what it is provided I can do it. If I can do it, I'll do it better than it was ever done before. If I can't, well, then I'll quit and save you the embarrassment of firing me. All I want is a chance to cut the buck and hold my own. You wanted me, Cappy? Yes, Skinner, I want you to take this young man into your office and give him a good workout to see the stuff he's made of. Mr. Ricks... as a favor to me, Skinner, my dear boy. As a favor to me. Very well, sir. Have you arranged compensation for Mr. Austin? Far be it from me to interfere in the internal administration of your department, Mr. Skinner. Naturally, you'll give Mr. Austin what he deserves and not a cent more. Now see here, young fella. I want you to step right up to the plate and hit the ball on the nose. Do it early and often. But the first time you hit a foul tip, you'll be warned, and the second time you'll get a month's layoff to think it over. The third time, you'll be out. Do I make myself clear? You do, sir. All I want is fighting room. Mr. Skinner, I want to thank you for this opportunity. I only hope I'll be worthy of your confidence in me. Ha ha ha. When do I report for duty, sir? Whenever you're ready. Let me see... It's 11:00 now. I think I'll pop out and wrap myself around some rations, and I'll be back in an hour. Might just as well knock out half a day's pay. I'm afraid I'm off to a bad start, Mr. Ricks. You only asked for a start. I didn't guarantee to give you a good start. Eh? William? Well, more familiarly known as Bill, sir. Very well, Bill. I'll have my eye on you, young fella. Thank you, sir. And thanks for the chance. Good day, sir. Now, Cappy, look here. When will you stop forever... not a peep out of you, Skinner. Not a peep. How you could have the heart to turn down a man who lost a leg in the line of duty, a man with that unwhipped, unbeatable grin that young fella has. There's no sentiment in business. Your Mr. Austin doesn't make a hit with me. He burst into my office and asked me for a job, and I gave him his answer. Then he went to Peasely and was refused. Then, to demonstrate his bad taste, he went over our heads and induced you to pitchfork him into a job. He'll regret the day he was ever inspired to do that. Skinner. Skinner. Look me in the eye. Do you know why I asked you to take on Bill Austin? I do. Because you're too soft-hearted for your own good. You unimaginative dunderhead. You gibbering jackdaw. How can I reject a man who refuses to be rejected? He sized you up just like that. He declined to permit you to block him. Skinner, that Austin boy's been opposed by experts. Now, what kind of a job are you going to give him? Well, I thought I'd let him try to peddle that 1/2 million feet of skunk spruce you bought. Skunk spruce, huh? All right, give him the rotten stuff to peddle. Give him everything the lumber trade refuses as a gift. You get me, don't you, Skinner? And if he fails to make good, he's out? Well, I suppose so, but I... I hate to think about it. On the other hand, if he makes good, he gets Andrews's job and salary. We must be fair, Skinner. Whatever our faults, we must always be fair. Oh, there, there, Skinner. Ha ha ha. Forgive me for being a trifle, uh... Ha ha. Well, listen, Skinner. If you put a prohibitive price on that skunk spruce, by the holy pink-toed prophet, I'll fire you! Be fair, boy. Be fair. No dirty work. You live here? No. I thought not. I got a date. Who with? The maid. What's she look like? Well, she's blonde and slender, and she, well, she comes to about here on me. Oh, the second-floor maid. Well, she's all right. Yeah. Good night. Good evening. I, um... Well, I'm calling for... Well, I'm looking for the second-floor chambermaid. We've got a date. Oh. Maizie, it's your gentleman friend. Show him in. Oh, thanks. Did you want to see me? Oh, no, thanks. You're not the one I want. Well, that is, you're not the one I'm looking for. The one I want is sort of fair and slender. Something like you, yeah. Well, today she had a dress on with a hat sort of like that, you know, with rings around it. Did you say she was fair? Yes. Blonde? That's right. What's the matter? Oh. Nothing. Nothing at all. Will you tell her I'm here, please? Yes, yes, of course. Did you tell her? Hold him, men! Wait a minute! But I tell you, Lloyd, I have a date. With whom? You'd be surprised. I beg pardon, sir. We believe we've caught a man with intentions to kidnap miss Margaret in the rear. What? Hide yourself, my dear. Hide. There's a man here to kidnap you. Kidnap her? Cappy, give me that gun. You stay here. I suppose you think I'm too old to kidnap... protect my own daughter! Well, I... you. Mr. Ricks. This is the kind of thanks you get for hiring a man blindly. I didn't think you'd try to do this to me, young man. Do what, sir? Try to kidnap my daughter. He isn't trying to kidnap me. I've got a date with him. Well then, why in blazes did you use the back door? I thought she worked here. Worked here? Ha ha ha. If you'll excuse me, I'll get my hat. We're going to the movies. If you'll excuse me, I'll be going. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Listen, Mr. Ricks. I better call this thing off. You see, I had no idea it was your daughter. I couldn't take her out on a streetcar. Why not? I courted her mother on a horsecar when we could afford it. Do you want to see the history of my life, Bill? Sure, sir. Sit down. Who wrote it? I did. I carved it out of the first tree I brought down. Look here. See? This is a piece of my first log. I was just a sprout when I carved that first ring. I've carved one every year since then. I met Margaret's mother on this ring. Now, this one is important. I married her that year, so that's Sally's ring. And then Margaret came along. I put a little Nick in it. Sally and I thought there'd be more nicks later on, but... She died that year. Margaret's the only Nick in the chain... Because she's my only kid. The years dragged slowly after that. I thought I'd retire on this one. But here we have this year, number 40, and I'm still in harness. When are you going to finish this year's? I don't finish them until something important happens. Something important to remember the link by. Say, by the way, Bill, did you ever have any experience in selling skunk spruce? What kind of stock is it? Humboldt county, California, spruce. Coarse and stringy, wet and heavy. Smells like a skunk directly after using it. I'm afraid Skinner's going to start you at the bottom, and skunk spruce is it. Oh. Can you drive nails in it? Oh, yes. Anyone ever buy skunk spruce? Occasionally one of our bright young men digs up a half-wit who's willing to try anything once. I bought this shipment myself, uh, to help out an old friend, and I'd appreciate it personally if you'd sell it. Skinner uses skunk spruce to humble the salesmen. Now, if you sold it, we might be able to humble Mr. Skinner. You understand? Yes, sir. I get it. I'll sell it if I have to invent a use for it. Good. Dad. Dad, where are you? Here... here I am, here I am. You won't have to wait up for me tonight, darling. I'm in good hands. I'm afraid you are, my dear. Good-bye, Mr. Ricks. I don't suppose I'll see you before I come back from my skunk expedition. Good luck, my boy. Thank you, sir. Good night. Not tonight, George. We're taking the streetcar. Very well, miss. After you've been to the movies, do you always have such good ideas? Fisherman's wharf is a favorite haunt of mine. You want fresh crab? Fresh shrimp? Or maybe just the fresh moon? Whatever we came for, we got a fresh fisherman. Ha ha. You no foolin' me. I bring my girl down here 10, 12 year ago. I no buy the fresh crab or fresh shrimp. I just ask her to be my wife. What did she say? She said, "buy me some shrimp." Ha ha ha. Then what did she say? You buy some shrimp. I tell you. All right. I'll buy some. Si, senor. Want to get up there? Mm-hmm. It's fun. Uh-huh. Shrimp? Bet you're not having as much fun as I am. More. Do you like me like I like you? More. Really? Mm-hmm. Can't we come here again soon? Gee, there's nothing I'd like better. You see, I've got to start off on a long trip in the morning. A million feet of skunk spruce and bull pine, some odd lengths, and some larch flooring to sell. Imagine. Sounds like a lot of stuff that trade doesn't want. It is. I've got a hunch your dad and Skinner are trying me out the hard way. I've got a hunch that you'd make good even if they gave you the petrified forest to sell. Why do you think that? Oh, I don't know. I think I'd have to buy anything you tried to sell me. Even if it was one load of Bill Austin? F.O.B. Frisco? From what I've checked on, I don't think I could turn down the order. Here they are. Ha ha ha. Here they are, Skinner. Ha ha ha. What did I tell you? What did I tell you? You send that young man out in the toughest territory we've got, and what does he do? He sells lumber where you've failed to place orders in years. He's getting prices higher than you quoted him. He sold our yards out of skunk spruce, odds and ends, and bull pine, and he's begging for more. Yes, and he's selling mining timber faster than we can deliver it. He'll ruin our standing. You mean to tell me that the Ricks lumber company can't keep up with a fella with a game leg? Another order from Mr. Austin. Let me have it. "Got a spring order for 10,000 oil derricks if you can handle your end." Ha ha ha. You can't stop him. How about that oil Derrick stock? We didn't send him out... We sent him out to sell. He sold all the rotten stuff we gave him, and he's begging for more. Now, how about the oil derricks? Our lumber camps can't keep up with this. There is such a thing as supply. Supply be blazed. If our camps can't supply US, buy it from a competitor. Have Austin get a profit for US. The Oregon Royal is the only camp that can supply oil Derrick timber in the quantity we need, and their price is sky high. We couldn't make a profit. Hammer their prices down. I've tried, and I can't. You've tried. Ha! Get me Bill Austin on the long-distance phone. How much are you paying Austin? 150. He secured US 18 new accounts, sold out our lumberyards, and you're only paying him $150 a month? All right, I'll raise his salary around the first of the year. Why wait until the first of the year? Your pernicious habit of trying to save money has cost US the services of more than one good man. You know you've got to raise Bill Austin's salary. Why not do it now? He may conclude that you're a human being after all. Very well, sir. I'll give him the salary that Andrews was making before Austin took over his territory. Skinner! Sometimes you make it impossible for me to refrain from showing you who's boss around here. He's better than Andrews, isn't he? Isn't he? I suppose he is. Well, then, for the love of a square deal, why don't you pay him more and pay him from the day he went to work? Get out. You make me nervous. Wait a minute. How is Andrews getting along on that Shanghai job? Peasely's disgusted with him. He cables 3 times a week on matters he should decide for himself. Mr. Austin is answering your call to Texas, sir. Hello, Bill. How are you? Good. How long will they hold off on that oil Derrick offer? Well, you hop a plane for Seattle. Yeah. Try and get Oregon Royal's entire supply of heavy timber. Karl Stone's the man who owns it. Yeah, he's the one to see. Ha ha. Stone's as hard as his name. Skinner can't even dent him. You see what you can do. All right. Good. Good-bye. Ha ha ha. I'm sorry, Mr. Austin, but that's my price. I understand that, sir, but... Beg your pardon, Mr. Stone, but are you going up to number 3 first? Yeah. Ok, sir, I'll see you up there. All right. If you'll just come down a few thousand on that... I told you my price, and I'm sticking to it. I'm the only man on the pacific coast can fill your orders. Tell Cappy Ricks to pay up or shut up. I've got my orders to get your timber at our price. And I won't sell. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to head out on the job. Mind if I tag along, sir? If you can keep up with me, come ahead. You can't afford to turn down Cappy Ricks' order. He hasn't done business with me in 3 years. I've done all right. Give me your report, Pete. Yes, sir. What about the years to come? I have a corner in the Derrick timber market. Cappy Ricks pays me my price. How long will you have control? I have the big stuff tied up for 3 years. Plenty of it. When your 3 years are up, what are you going to do for a market? I'll meet that problem when it comes. If Cappy Ricks buys your entire product for the next 10 years, what then? My entire product for 10 years? You heard me. What's the deal? Market price on everything, short ends to Derrick timbers. Shingles to logs. For 10 years? For 10 years. It's a deal. Do you know what your fair-haired boy Austin's done now? Yeah. Contracted for the output of Oregon Royal for 10 years. By whose authority? Mine. His call came in while you were delivering your lecture to the women's club on how I organized the lumber industry of California. We'll make enough profit out of the oil derricks to get rid of the short ends. Austin has cleaned out our lumberyards and now he's filling them with the finest stock coming out of Oregon. There isn't room in this office for both Austin and me. Either he gets out or I do. Calm down, Skinner. Calm down. Ha ha. I already have plans... To get Mr. Austin out of this office. What? Yes, sir. I think he has the earmarks of a good manager for our Shanghai office. He hasn't even been tested. But he will be on his return from Oregon. Yes, sir, Mr. Skinner. Mr. Bill Austin will be thoroughly tested before he goes to Shanghai. I'm going to give him the job of delivering my blue vase. And if he fails to deliver it, he doesn't go to Shanghai? If he fails to deliver it, he doesn't go to Shanghai. But I think he will. Shall I make the usual arrangements for the test? We'll put him through my 33rd degree Saturday night. Oh, Cappy. If you'll pardon the suggestion, I wouldn't mention giving the blue vase test to Austin to Margaret. Huh? Well, she might tip him off. What makes you think so? Oh. Ha ha. All right, Skinner. I won't mention it to Margaret. Mr. Austin is here. Just arrived from the airport. Good. Show him in. Ha ha ha. Congratulations, Austin. I'm boosting your salary. You can collect your commissions from the cashier. Thank you, sir. Not at all. Saturday. Saturday. Ha ha ha! Welcome home, my boy. Thank you, sir. How's Stone? He was a little tough, sir. You got the business. That's what counts. You did a fine job, my boy. A fine job. Now I'd like to top my sales campaign. How? Well, sir, I'd like to sell myself as a shopworn Bill of goods to your daughter Margaret. That's been tried by some very excellent salesmen. Yes, sir, but I wanted to ask you if you would object to having a son-in-law with a game leg. All that I require in a man is the stuff that makes a fighting heart, and you've got it. But as far as women... oh! That's something different. Ha ha. Margaret will never marry anybody. I tried to get rid of her for a long time. Come to think of it, I don't want her to marry anybody. By the blue blazes, if you try to take her away from me, I'll fire you. Fire me if you like. I'll ask her anyway. What's that? Look here, young man. Did you hear what I said? Yes, I did. You said you were going to fire me, and I told you I was going to ask her anyway. Good-bye. What? 400, 450, 475. Pretty good selling for a beginner. I've got the hardest selling job of my life right ahead of me. Here's $475. Give me that in what it's worth in an engagement ring. Yes, sir. You haven't told me where you're going to take me yet. Well, there's something I want to ask you. I'm going to take you down to fisherman's wharf to ask it. Fisherman's wharf? Yup. They'll be unloading the fish. It'll be fun. Yes. What'll be fun? Having you ask me to marry you while they're unloading the fish. How did you know? Oh, I've been asked before. I know all the symptoms. Oh. Was I wrong? No. Yeah! No! Fare, please. Fare. There. Well, I don't suppose any use dragging you all the way down there just to turn me down. There isn't. I can say yes here just as well as any other place. Yeah. What? Hello, dad. Where have you been? Oh, riding around in a streetcar with Bill. Well, what are you grinning about? And you're not going to fire him. I don't want you to get married. What do you want me to do, become an old maid? No. I want you to stay here with me. What's the matter? Have you got anything against Bill? No. I'm selfish. I admit it. And I intend to keep on being selfish as far as you're concerned. I don't want you to marry anybody. You think I want to stay in this house alone? Do you think I want to have dinner with myself? A girl's got to get married sometime. Why does she? Why? So she can have a husband and things. I suppose you're unhappy keeping me company. Of course not, darling. Then why do you want to leave me and get married? Don't I feed you enough? Do you think Bill Austin can buy you furs and a limousine? I don't expect him to. I love him. What's that got to do with it? You married mother when she was younger than I am. Supposing she hadn't married you. Well, that's different. Your mother needed a husband to take care of her. You don't. Anything you need or want, I get for you. I need and want Bill Austin for a husband. And I give the orders in this house. I didn't raise you to give you away to the first man that comes along. Bill isn't the first man to come along. Ah! He just happens to be the first man that I've ever loved with all my heart. You'll get over it. I won't need to. We're going to be married. I suppose you've already set the date. Oh, no. Bill spent all his money to get this ring. We won't be married for months. Months, huh? Oh, well, that's not so bad. A lot of things can happen in a few months. Can't they, my dear? Skinner? Now, get this. Tomorrow is Saturday. Mr. Bill Austin has got to face the test of the blue vase tomorrow. If he passes it, he's on the boat to Shanghai by Wednesday. If he fails to deliver it, he gets fired. I understand perfectly. I have the vase right here, and I'll make all the necessary arrangements tonight. I'll have Austin here at 1:00 tomorrow. I'll hear from you then, right? Right. Good night, Cappy. Well, Mr. Austin, if you deliver this vase, you're a better man than I am, and I don't think you are. Mr. Austin to see Mr. Skinner. Come right in, sir. Mr. Skinner's expecting you, sir. Right this way, please. He's in bed today, sir. He's afraid it's neuritis. Mr. Austin. Have him come in. Thank you. You sent for me, sir? Oh, yes, Austin. I'm laid up in bed, nervous inflammation. Gee, I hope you feel better than you look. I couldn't come to the office this morning. That's why I sent for you. I have a list of new customers here I want to go over with you. Sit down. Thank you. Yes? Oh, yes, Mr. Ricks. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I'd love to attend to your errand for you, but I'm laid up in bed. However, Austin's here. I'm sure he'd be happy to attend to it for you. Sure. Just ask Mr. Ricks who he wants murdered and where he wants the body delivered. Ha ha. Austin will be delighted. He wants to know who you want murdered and where you want the body delivered. Ha ha ha ha. Mr. Ricks will speak to you. Good afternoon, Mr. Ricks. Hello, Bill. Now, here it is. Today I saw a blue vase in a store window on sutter street near stockton. Just a minute, sir. I'll write that down. A pad right there. Thanks. I couldn't take time to stop, but I want that vase for one of the dearest and sweetest ladies I know. Her wedding anniversary is tomorrow, and I'm leaving from the southern pacific station at 8:00 tonight, bound for Santa Barbara to attend. You understand? I get it, sir, and you want to take the blue vase with you tonight. Exactly. Now, I haven't time to get it before the store closes. If I'd discovered it yesterday, I wouldn't be asking you to break your date. It's a cloisonne vase. Blue. Yes. It has a lot of oriental funny business on it. About a foot tall, 4 inches in diameter, and stands on a teakwood base. A teakwood base. All right, sir. And you shall have it. And, Bill, I forgot to tell you. I'll be in compartment "a," car 7. Yes, sir. Oh, and Mr. Ricks. Don't forget to explain to Margaret, will you, sir? By all means, Bill. Oh, she'll understand it. And by the way, you pay for the vase. The expense will be trifling. Go to the cashier on Monday morning and charge it to my account. Thank you, Bill! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Going somewhere, my dear? Yes. Bill and I are going up to golden gate park. Oh, I'm afraid Mr. Austin can't make it. I just talked to him. Sends his apologies. Says he has a date with a little lady in blue. I don't believe it. He'll be here. Maybe so, dear. But I'm afraid the little lady in blue will make it a bit difficult. These people in San Jose used to buy from me. Gee, I hate to interrupt you, Mr. Skinner, but don't you think I better go after that vase for Mr. Ricks? It's a very simple errand. You've plenty of time. Of course, if this bores you. Oh, no, sir. It isn't that. It's just that I don't want to let Mr. Ricks down. It's only a couple of hours till train time, and the store closes at 6:00. Very well. You may go. Oh, thank you, sir. Well, here's to the blue vase. No, Mr. Austin. Mr. Ricks isn't here, sir. Miss Margaret isn't either, sir. I don't know anything about a vase, sir. I suggest you try some other streets. Mr. Ricks has a very bad memory for names of streets, sir. I'm very sorry. Ha ha ha ha! Good work, Thomason. Have a cigar. Thank you very much. I don't mind if I do. Is miss Margaret in her room? Yes, sir. And if I may say so, she's very angry about something. Well, that might help, too. See that no telephone calls reach her. I understand, sir. Have another cigar. Thank you very much. My bags packed? Yes, sir. All ready to go. Good. I'll be ready in 10 minutes. Hey, what are you trying to do there, young fella? I got to get that blue vase out of there. It's a matter of life and death. Well, why don't you phone the man that runs the shop? That's a good idea. J. Brown. Thanks. Brown is the name. Sausages is the product. What can I do for you? I'm sorry. They do not answer. Jessica Brown maternity home. My name's j. Brown. Yes. Blue vase? No. I sell rubber goods. Sorry. The line's out of order. I'll report it for you. Ha ha! Mr. Brown has just passed out. You want John Brown, you say? That goes for me, too, mister. He just left me for a flatfooted, high-steppin', high-yellow, and if I ever get ahold of her... Sorry, that line is temporarily disconnected. I've tried every j. Brown in San Francisco, Alameda, Oakland, palo alto, and redwood city. Are you sure you got the name spelled right? Oh, sure. You know, sometimes those browns are spelled with an "e." With an "e"? Sure. No. I'm positive. It's Brown. J. Brown. B-r-o-w-n. Brow... Holy smoke. So, you think it's spelled with an "e", huh? Sometimes. Maybe you're right. I'm so slugged under now, I don't know what I'm doing. But I'll look again. But if I have to take that Brown census again tonight, so help me, I'll cave in. "E"? There you are. Better luck this time. Thanks, Henley, but I got just 28 minutes to meet a train. Hello. Hello. Who do you know that I know? No no no. Don't tell me. Let me guess. Let me guess. Let me see... Yes, sir. This is Mr. J. Browne's residence. Yes, sir. Mr. Browne do run an art shop on lesalle. Let me speak to him. It's important. I'm sorry, but Mr. Browne is dining with his friend Mr. Simmons in mill valley. Hello? Yeah, we got Mr. Browne here for dinner. Who wants to talk to him? Boston? Boston, Massachusetts? Oh, what a thrill. I... yes, just a minute. It shall be done. It shall be done. Hello, Mr. Browne? Mr. Browne says he don't know anybody from Boston. He wants to know what you want. He says that he's eating, and he don't want to be disturbed unless it's awful important. But it is important! No, no, no. Not Boston. Austin. "A," like in ant. No, no, no. Not pan... let it go. You call Browne to the phone, or I'll come over on the next boat and kill you. Tell him his store is on fire! What? On fire?! Oh! Mr. Browne. Mr. Browne. Your store on the phone's on fire. Store on fire? Are you sure? Oh, hello, Mr. Browne? Listen, your store isn't on fire. I had to tell you that to get you on the phone. Look, there's a blue vase in your store, and I got to get it inside of 15 minutes. No. I'm not crazy. Only to get that vase. I don't care what it costs. I've got to get that vase, and I've got to get it right away. Now, do I get it? It is not my custom to do business after hours. Besides, I do not intend to insult my host by leaving in the middle of dinner. It's absolutely impossible for me to reach the shop by 8:00. I presume that 9:00 would be too late, eh? I want that vase, and I want it in 15 minutes! Your impetuosity overwhelms me, Mr. Boston. My only suggestion is that you call up my assistant, John Luce. Bryant 3-2-4-9. And tell him that I approve his coming down to sell you the blue vase. Good-bye, Mr. Boston. No. John ain't home now. I'm his mother. John's been invited to the country club. What's that? What country club? My land, is there more than one? Heh. Well, then I guess you'll have to try 'em all. 'Night. Mr. Juice is not a member, sir. Mr. Luce is not in. Mr. Goose? Oh, Mr. Goose has been dead 3 months, and a charming man... All aboard! Sante Fe, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles. All aboard. I told you so, Cappy. He isn't going to deliver your vase. You better get on your train. I'm afraid you're right. I kind of thought he'd make it. Good-bye, Skinner. Good-bye. Gee, two minutes of 8:00. Well, I'm not licked yet. Attaboy. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to heave a brick right through that window, grab the vase, and make a run for it. Here. You keep this. It'll pay for my bail and the vase if they throw me in the jug. I'll keep this for taxi fare if I get away with it. Well, you can trust me. I'll be here all night. Thanks. Good luck. "N"? I must be going crazy. Hello. Nice night, officer. That's what you think. Yeah, well, that's what I thought. Well, have another think. Well, so it's a rotten night, officer. You said it. It's kind of cold to be standing around in one spot, isn't it? Oh, one spot's as good as another. Yeah. Well, you know, I've always read that if you walked around a little bit, you know... just a block or two, even... Why, it keeps your blood circulating. My blood don't need circulating. So you guess you'll stand right there, eh? I guess that's right. Say, what are you hanging around here for? Oh. Just out for a little evening stroll, that's all. Yeah? Well, then, stroll along. I don't like company. All right. I was just trying to be friendly, that's all. Wait a minute. What's this? Oh. Oh, that? That's a moonstone. You know, I've always collected moonstones. Found that one on the beach. What beach? I don't know. It didn't have a name on it. Move along, or I'll run you in. All right. See you later. Yeah? And if you come back here, I'll be seeing you first. Hello, I... No. No, John ain't home yet. Wait a minute. Maybe this is him now. John? Yes, mother. Do you want me? Telephone wants you. Thank you. Yes? Mr. Browne asked you to call me? Well, I'll call Mr. Browne, and if he confirms your message, I'll meet you at the shop. 9:00. Good-bye. I told you if I saw you here again, I'd run you in. Run me in? For what? For collecting moonstones, if nothing else. I got just as much right to stand here as you have. Not with moonstones in your fist, you haven't. Aw, the moonstone's in the gutter. Yeah? And that's where you'll be if you give me any more of your lip. Well, I'm here on business. What kind of business? None of yours. Pretty smart boy, aren't you? Well, I'm smart, too. I suppose you don't think I know you've got your eye on that blue vase in the window. Gee, you're smarter than you look. And what's more, you're right. And furthermore, I'm going to get that blue vase out of that window. Not with me standing here you're not. $5.00 says I do. With me standing here? With you standing here. The bet's on. Let's see you get that vase. Good evening, Reilly. Mr. Austin? Oh, Mr. Luce! Come right in. How much is that thing? $1,000. What? $1,000? Cash. Cash? You mean, you absolutely refuse to accept my check? Why, I don't even know you. Do you know a good watch when you see one? I do. It's a beautiful watch. Must be of great sentimental value to you. It's not enough deposit to exchange for the vase. Not even with $100 thrown in? Not even with $100. Well, how much more will it take? Oh, about 450 more. 450 more? Say, do you know a good diamond ring when you see one? I do. Well, will you wait here 15 minutes till I get one? I'll leave the watch for deposit. Sure. Be right back. Good luck. Wait right here for me. Yes, sir. Where's miss Margaret? I believe she's up in her room, sir. Margaret! Margaret. I never want to see you again as long as I live, Bill Austin. You can't break a date with me for any lady in blue. I can't what?! Oh, listen, darling, I haven't got time to explain. All I want is that engagement ring I gave you. You didn't have to humiliate me by asking for it first. I was going to give it to you the next time I saw you anyway. Margaret, what are you talking about? Go on. You've got your ring. But wait a minute. What's the matter? Go on. Listen, Margaret. If you'd only give me a chance to explain, I... I paid 475 for it, and they told me I was getting a bargain. Will that be enough with the watch and the money till I give you Mr. Ricks' check? Because I've got to have that ring back. You can have the vase. Fork over that $5.00, brother; I'll need it for cab fare. Come on. Hurry up. Here you are, buddy. My hat's off to you. Thanks. I haven't delivered the thing yet. Hey, taxi! Wait for me. Hello, shipmate. You're a little late for the ceremony, but a pal's a pal. Come on in. Are you talking in your sleep? Listen, Bob, listen. Listen, I got to... Ha ha! Darling, Bill was too late for the wedding, but he's here to meet the bride. Mary, this is Bill. Hello, Bill. Oh, hello. Gee, I didn't know you were married. I guess I came at a bad time, huh? Oh, that's all right, Bill. There's a couch in the living room there. Help yourself. I don't want a couch. I want a plane. Sure. Third hangar on the left. Help yourself. You got to fly it, if the lady will excuse you. Excuse him? On our wedding night? Quiet, Mary. You in trouble, Bill? Yes. I've got to catch the lark before it gets to Santa Barbara. It's a cinch. You can't do this to me, Bob Blair! Quiet, Mary! Bill and I were shipmates, and once a shipmate, always a shipmate. I'll catch the lark and be back in an hour. Gee, Mrs. Blair, I'm sorry about this. You're sorry? Why'd I ever marry an aviator? Oh, now, Mrs. Blair, your husband has some very fine points. Listen, Bill, I think she knows my fine points better than you do. Bye, honey. Be back in an hour. I'll wake you up. You got a good book? Hold this for me, will ya? Gee, I can't thank you enough. There's the railroad tracks over there. Say, by the way, would you like for me to stall this ship in the middle of the tracks for you, pal? No. I'll take care of stopping the train. You go back and take care of your bride. Ok. Good luck, shipmate. So long. What do you mean, flagging this train? Never mind. I got a message for the man in compartment "a," car 7. If you try to stop me, there'll be a murder. Yeah? That man is here, sir. What man? Bill! Come in. Well, come in, Bill. I think I got it, sir. Sit down. Sit down. You know... I'm sorry I missed you at the train. But the fact is there were so many browns. And it was such a job to dig up the $1,000 that I failed to connect with you at 8:00. But I couldn't let you down, and here's your vase. There. Incidentally, sir, that shop wasn't within 8 blocks of where you told me it was. So, I hope it's the right vase. Oh, it's the right vase, Bill. Well, it should be. It cost enough and was hard enough to get. By the sacred beard of Neptune... We changed the signs on you, stacked the browns on you... We even put a cop at the store so that you wouldn't break the window. We made you dig up $1,000 on Saturday night. We knew you'd miss the train. Heh. And still you catch up with US at 2:00 and deliver the vase. So it was a plan, huh? I've pounded this game like a man until I was red-hot. Just for a joke, huh? I've stood a lot of things in my life, but this tops everything. I guess I can't take it. I can't stand things like I used to. You see, I was trained to obey orders, not question them. Even when it was impossible. And above all, I've been taught loyalty. I see that means nothing to you. Well, you're right, Bill. It was cruel, terribly cruel. But I had a big job for you. And I had to find out a lot of things about you before I entrusted you to that job. So I arranged the degree of the blue vase. And it's the supreme test of a go-getter. You thought you brought a $1,000 vase into this stateroom, didn't you? Well, between ourselves, what you really brought in here was a $10,000 job as manager of the Shanghai office. Thank you, sir. And I forgive you. And I'll make good on that Shanghai job. I know you will, Bill. I know you will. But listen, tell me. What made you insist on going after the vase after you discovered how utterly impossible it seemed? Well, sir, my commanding officer on the Macon had a motto: It shall be done. He gave me a watch with that written on it. And when I was about to give up watching the time, why, those words just seemed to keep looking at me. So you see, I had to make good, sir, not only for you, but for my old skipper. Let me see the watch. I hocked it to get the vase. You hocked it? For a $2.00 vase? A $2.00 vase? Do you mean to say that I've been jackass enough to take Margaret's ring back and hock my watch... the one possession of value that I have in the world... for a $2.00 vase?! Now, listen... I thought I had to make good for you. You did make good. You'll get your watch back. And you've won a job. And I'll see that Margaret gets her engagement ring after you've left for Shanghai. After I've left? You're leaving Wednesday. Then she's going with me. Oh, no, she's not. Oh, yes, she is! Wait a minute... Are you trying to get rid of me because I love Margaret? On the contrary, Bill. You see, Margaret doesn't know her own mind... Doesn't know her own mind? Don't be ridiculous. She knows her own mind enough to know that if I go to Shanghai, it's going to make a swell honeymoon. Aren't you being overly presumptuous, young man? Just presumptuous enough to know that if I go to Shanghai, Margaret's going with me. And you call this gratitude? I call it my love for Margaret and hers for me. And I say that Margaret stays here with me! And I'll bet you my Shanghai job that she comes with me! I'll take that bet! I received both these telegrams at the same time last night. One says, "meet me at the station, 9 A.M. Wednesday. Dad." And the other, "meet me at the station. 9 A.M. Wednesday. Bill." I can't go wrong. I thought you said you were through with Bill Austin. Oh, that's before I found out he wanted our engagement ring for that blue vase. Oh, here they come! Don't you tell me what my daughter'll do! I'll show you. Don't you listen to that... Margaret, listen. One at a time. Now, you listen to me... she hasn't got time to listen to you. We got to get married. If you don't listen to me, I'll disown you! Go ahead and disown her. I'll take care of her. And who gave you the job so you could take care of her? You did, and if you don't think I can take care of her without that blue vase job, keep the job. Keep quiet! Aren't you ashamed, the both of you? Look at all these people. You're coming home with me. No, she isn't coming home with you. $5.00 he marries the girl. Go ahead and marry him, my dear. If he's sucker enough to get married, let him. You keep your mouth shut. Come on, darling, our first stop is the marriage license bureau and a minister. Oh, no, it's not. Margaret's going home with him. No, she isn't. She's coming with me, and she's going to stay with me. And I say she's going home with me! I say she isn't! Bill, I can come to you in Shanghai. No. You got to come with me now, or I don't go to Shanghai. Why not? Because I bet Cappy my Shanghai job you would come with me. And I took the bet. Daddy, tell the maid to pack my trunks. I'm going with Bill to Shanghai. Look here, young man, you said you could take orders. Now take this order from me. You're not going to marry my daughter! Listen, Cappy, if you wanted me to swim to Shanghai, I'd start now. If you wanted the moon, I'd hire a rocket and get it tonight. But Margaret and I are going to become Mr. and Mrs. Bill Austin, honeymooning for Shanghai inside of 12 hours. Good-bye. Bill! Margaret! Come back here! Come back here! By the holy pink-toed prophet! They can't do that to me. Skinner, they can't do that to me. No. Certainly not. I'll buy up every cabin on the ship. Call the Barker. Buy up all the available space. If they have a honeymoon tonight, they'll have it in a rowboat. Come on. I now pronounce you man and wife. Yes, sir. The president sails at 4:00. We have no accommodations, sir. We're all filled up. You mean to say you haven't got any accommodations at all? No, sir. Every stateroom on the boat is taken. But I've already sent down my trunks. They will go as ordered, madam. But there must be one stateroom. How come you're sold out for the first time in a year? A Mr. Ricks bought up all the available space. He must be giving vacation trips to his company. Mr. Ricks, huh? I thought so. Come on, dear. We'll sail on schedule. Well? They haven't come aboard, Mr. Ricks. Positive? Positive, sir. I haven't left the gangplank, sir. I've checked every first-class passenger. And I've checked third class. Your daughter and her husband are not on this boat. I must get aboard; We're raising the gangplank. Many thanks. Oh, not at all. That young whelp will have to get up early in the morning to get ahead of me. Ha ha! All right. Take it away. It's the first time in 20 years ever put anything over on Cappy Ricks. Ok. Slack off. That'll teach that young Austin that an old man's brains grow sharper with the years. And he thought you couldn't stop him from sailing. I bet they're home right now, ready and willing to scalp me. Look! Yoo-hoo, Cappy! By the holy... Well, I guess we're licked. Licked? I'll have them turn the ship back. I won't let him put anything over on me! Come on. You mean to say that you won't even help an old shipmate? I won't even turn the ship back for you, Cappy. But they haven't got any tickets. Besides, I bought up all the space you had on board. Yeah, that's right. And thanks to your generous order, we've got 53 empty staterooms going to waste. Well, they're not going to have any of mine. You can't use 53 staterooms, Cappy. We couldn't begrudge your charming daughter the use of one of them. Couldn't ask her to sleep on deck. No, but you can let her make a laughingstock out of me. A nincompoop! You make a nincompoop out of yourself. It's all right with me. I'll never ship another ton of cargo on your line. Oh, don't make me laugh. You send your own cargo on your own ship. I wish we'd soaked you double fare on your 53 staterooms. The joke's on the Ricks navigation company, Cappy. You know what I'm going to do? Huh? I'm going to advertise that when Cappy Ricks' daughter sailed on her honeymoon, she and her husband chose the president line. What? Yes, sir. And do you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to advertise that Cappy Ricks thought so much of the president line's superiority over his own that he bought 53 staterooms. I'm going to... You're going to regret this, the longest day you live, you old pirate. Ha ha ha! Hello? Hello? Doesn't anybody work around here? Get me the radioman. Get the s.S. President. Get me... Cappy. Oh, Roberts. Just the man I want to see. You're a lawyer. How do you stop a ship from going to Shanghai? Sink it. Sink it! What? This is no time for levity. I pay you thousands of dollars a year for your advice. How do you stop a ship from going to Shanghai? I haven't the slightest idea. Great wampus cat! Do you realize this is serious? It isn't half as serious as some things I've got to tell you. Now listen, Cappy, I've been trying to locate you all day. I've been trying to locate Skinner. And now I hear that you're playing hide-and-seek with a boy and girl on their honeymoon when your business is being blasted sky high. What do you mean? I mean just this, that 9/10 of all our waterfront mills and all the logging camps went on strike this morning. What? Yes. And all the retail lumber yards and box factories are either shutting down right now or not far from it. Do you realize, Cappy, that we've got 40,000 men out of work while you're out on those docks playing games? Why didn't you tell me? What am I paying you for? It would have cost you 5 cents to call this office and tell them where you and Skinner were playing tag. But oh, no, you wouldn't do that. You'd rather go ahead and lose $5 million just to stop a couple of youngsters from having a honeymoon. Oh, we've had strikes before. That's your business. Settle it. They won't settle with me. Well, then, let them settle with Skinner. He's the boss of the lumber company. He says I'm too old to handle the business. They won't talk to Skinner either. They say he double-crossed them before. Well, then, who will they talk to? The loggers' representative says that you've got a man here by the name of Bill Austin. Yeah. And all the men will trust him to arbitrate for you. Bill Austin? He's on the high seas. He's gone through the golden gate. On what ship? The president. Then get Barker on the phone and tell him what it means. Have him turn the ship back. Ha! Barker. He wouldn't turn an ashtray around for me after what happened this afternoon. I have it! Send an airplane. In a choppy sea and dark before they get there? Cappy, do you want to kill someone? Yes! No! Ha ha ha! What are you laughing at? See here, Cappy... shut up. Now see here, Roberts, you can't talk to me this way. I wouldn't have had to talk to you like this if you'd been in your office instead of being out on that dock making an ass out of yourself. Eh, you're right. You're right, Roberts. You're absolutely right. Abs... Skinner, you're fired. What? No, that wouldn't do any good. What we've got to do is to get Bill Austin back here. But how? How? How? How? How should I know? Ask Bill Austin, not me. Where's that radioman? Hurry up. Come here. Take a message. To Bill Austin, s.S. President. Imperative you return to San Francisco office immediately, even if you have to swim. Stop. This is an order. It's business. Urgent. Signed Cappy Ricks. Right away, sir. Now look here, Cappy, after all the things you did him today, do you expect him to believe that? He's got to believe it. He's got to. Darling... I love you so much. My sweet. I almost forgot. I've got a surprise for you. The only surprise I need is you in my arms and on our honeymoon. No. No, darling. Really I have. What is it? Let me get it for you. Well, what is it? Well, it's... it's a wedding present from me to you. Oh, when did you have time to buy me a wedding present? Before you got back on the train. How'd you know we were going to be married? Well, I guess I didn't. I just happened to turn into a wedding present. Let me see it. Gee... That's the most precious thing in the world to me. Outside of you. When I found out why you took our engagement ring and where you took it, I went and got it back for US. Thank you, darling. Radiogram, sir. Thank you. What's the matter, darling? Sorry, darling. Got to go back to San Francisco at once. It's orders. But he can't mean that. You can't go back now. He's joking. No, he isn't. He's serious. I'm sorry, darling, we'll have to pick up our honeymoon some other time. Oh, Bill, you're not going to leave me. You mustn't. You can't. Bill, it's our honeymoon. Bill. You've got to turn the ship back to port, sir. Are you mad? Aren't you on your honeymoon? Yes, but I've got to get back to San Francisco. Wife ill? No, Cappy Ricks wants me. Cappy Ricks? Ha! Look at this. Very well, captain. You've got your orders, and I've got mine. My name's Austin. Any messages for me? No, there's not, Mr. Austin. How far out from the golden gate are we? About 14 or 15 miles, sir. Just a minute. There's a message coming in now for him, sir. Mr. Austin? There's a message coming in right now for you, sir. Radioman, any message from Austin? No, sir. You're out of your mind, Cappy. Bill Austin will get back here somehow, someway, even if he has to swim. Swim? With one leg? They're several miles out. Yeah, and what's more, I'll bet any one of you any amount that I get a wireless from Bill Austin that he'll get back here. Ha ha ha. And I'll bet you an additional amount that I can name the exact words that will be in his message. I'm going to take advantage of you while your mind is weak. I'll bet you $5,000 that he doesn't get back and that you can't guess his message. And I'll bet $5,000. Well, just make mine $5.00. I'm not as sure as they are. All right, I'll take all the bets, and this will be his message. There. Now, look here. Ha ha ha. You hold it. And don't open it. And if those are not the exact words in his message, you win all the bets. I won't even peek. A message, sir, from Mr. Austin. Let me see. Ha ha ha! They you are. Compare them. "It shall be done. Austin." Well, it's all right about the message, Cappy, but the bet's not completed until Austin actually steps on the dock. Ha ha! All right. Do you want to double your bets? Huh? Darling, what are you looking for? A fishing boat. Any boat. Bill, there aren't any. Please come back. Oh, officer. Any chance of a passing boat? No, we left the fishing boats behind. The nearest Frisco-bound steamship is 200 miles from US, and it won't come close. Darling, you can't do anything now. Please come down. Well, when you come to your senses, you'll find me down in the cabin. Good-bye, sweetheart. Bill! Bill! Man overboard! "Cappy Ricks, San Francisco. "Your maniac has jumped overboard "and resisted every attempt to rescue him. "Stop. "He is in open sea 20 miles off golden gate "and good riddance. "Stop. "Have done all we could. Provided life raft. Signed, captain, s.S. President." Peasely, get the fastest speedboat the company owns and the best skipper. Call up my house and pick up a suit of clothes complete with all the fixings. Meet me at our dock in 20 minutes. And don't forget, bring a quart of Brandy. Right. Take a message. Mrs. Bill Austin on board s.S. President. Apologize for stealing your bridegroom, but it was absolutely necessary. Stop. If you want to stay married, wait Honolulu for him. Stop. If you change your mind, I'll pay your way around the world until you can forget Bill Austin. Personally, I love him. Signed, Cappy. Oh, I'm sorry. You're fired! Send the message. Everything's all ready, Cappy. Thanks, Peasely. Want to shove right off, Mr. Ricks? Yes! Here's your Brandy, Cappy. And here are the clothes. Shove off. Are you sure you know your bearings? Yes, sir, and allowed for drift. I know every wave by name between here and Alaska. What's that out there? Wait till I get the light on. There he is! That's him! Bill, who have you got with you? My bride. She, uh... She jumped in after me, but she hasn't spoken since. Bill! Here! Margaret! $5.00. This is the first time I ever lost money so willingly. And how do you boys feel? I don't care how you feel. Give me the money. Well, there's mine, Cappy. Ha ha ha. $10,0,0,0. And 5. Well, I better get back to the office. That was a fine job settling that strike with those men this morning, Austin. Thank you. Well, good morning, gentlemen. I want to speak to Mrs. Austin. Yeah, Mrs. Bill Austin. All right, miss Ricks. Ho ho ho! I know she's on her honeymoon, but where is she? I'm the groom. Where's my wife? I don't know. I didn't marry her. She wouldn't have you. Make a reservation for one on the next boat to Shanghai. What do you mean a reservation for one? My wife's going to Shanghai with me. Oh, no, she's not. You're wife's going to stay right here. I don't want her in Shanghai. Cappy, you can't do that. Who says I can't? I do! Cappy's right. Shanghai's no place for a woman. You're right, Skinner. Why you double-crossing... and you're not going either! Oh, Cappy, we've got to send someone. Sure we do! Got to have a man to make quick decisions 8,000 miles away from home. Yes. You always told me that, and so I'm sending you. Me? Now look here, Cappy... Not a peep out of you, Skinner. Not one peep. Go home and pack. Good-bye, Margaret. Good-bye? Where are you going? I've been shanghaied. Margaret. Peasely, see that Skinner gets away. Give him a good send-off. Wave good-bye with both hands. Where are you two going? We're going to continue our honeymoon, if you don't mind. Honeymoon, huh? And I suppose the Ricks lumber company can just go to pot because you two want a honeymoon? I have nothing further to do with the Ricks lumber company. You just gave Skinner my job. Margaret, you married a jackass. Your husband is the general manager of the biggest lumber company on the pacific coast. And he stands there and tells me to my face he has nothing to do with it. Mr. Ricks... Not one peep out of you, Austin. Not one peep. But, dad, aren't we even going to have a honeymoon? No, you're not. What? I don't want to stay in that big house alone and have dinner by myself. Do you mind, darling? No. Just wait right here, darling. Don't move. Now just a minute. By the holy pink-toed prophet, what did you do that for? We won't have any more trouble with that thing. Get out of this office, the both of you. It shall be done. Captioning made possible by Turner Entertainment Group
