Good evening, Buenos Aires. The weekend is finally upon us. I love the city in January how it empties out in the summer. Those who can, have left for the beach. Those who can't stay in the deserted city. Do you have plans for the weekend? It's going to be nice. 29?C. Enjoy the bars, the parks, the markets... go mix up with people, don't stay home... NOBODY'S WATCHING Did you know that ancient peoples did they use domes? It was the most resistant form in architecture. She says that alcohol doesn't agree with her... I'm saying that I always agree with alcohol! I like getting tipsy, but can not do it anymore. Look at him. He's clueless. He looked this way. I think he understands Spanish. - Nah, he doesn't. - He doesn't speak Spanish. Chill. He's looking this way. He never changed a diaper before. Maybe you can help him? - He needs a parenting class. - Or to download an application! Vivi! Vivi! Vivi! Help! It's alright... - What happened? - She's stuck. - I'm going to call emergency. - No wait. Wait. What are you doing? - You speak Spanish? - That man there is calling 911. - Police! - Quick, grab your stuff. - Let's go home. - Sofia, come! Go. I'll stay with her. I have to go, Ok? I'll be waiting in the corner. You stay with Marina. Dad is here. The police are on the way. - Where do they go? - Don't worry. - Ok. One, two, three, go! - That's it! Slowly... Help her legs... Bravo! That's it my doll! - What a nice baby! - Thank you. - Only that? - Yes They are $5.29. Ok. $6... Here is your change. Want a bag? - Do not. - Have a nice day. Good day. Finish in the next five minutes... Thank you so much. These last days have been terrible... with Pascal away and without Asunci?n. Asunci?n is coming back, isn't she? I don't know. Here... What are you doing? Andrea... - No, no, no. - Yes. No, no. We're friends, there's no need. - Go on. - No. Take it. You bought him diapers. - Organic ones. - I know. Seriously, Nico. Thank you. I'll take half for the diapers. Thanks. Hey, Mom! Fine, fine. At a party. With friends. Listen, mom. I'll call you later, ok? It's very noisy here, I'll call you later. Ok. Kisses. Bye. Bye, mom! It's delicious. Thank you. You welcome. - Are you going out? - Yes, I'm going out. You came back with Ellen? - Briana. - Briana? It's just the first date. If everything goes well, I'll tell you. You look so good, hot. - Yeah? - Yeah. Do you mind if I use your computer? - No, you can use it. - Thank you. - What are you doing? - Just for a while. No, no. - Come on. - No. Come on. Nico, don't leave me. Where is your... My goal? Here! Ok. Pass! Pass! Goal! Pass! Ask him, ask him... Hey there, Theo! - You are Argentine, right? - Yes. Hello girls! In few years, your little boy will be scoring some goals. I'm not his dad. He's my friend son. I'm looking after him. He's "helping" a friend. Are you on holiday? - No, I live here. - Got a Green Card? - No. - He's looking for a gringa to marry. But around here you will find no one. The gringa is the baby's mother. Isn't she? You look that actor from the soap opera... who was in a coma after his motorcycle accident. Motorcycle accident? I don't know. Yes, I know. - "Rivales"! - Yes. They showed it in Colombia. The actor was really handsome, taller with blue eyes. It's true that you look like him. I don't think so, eh? Argentine soaps are very sad. The ones from Brazil are prettier. His eyes were brown and sad like his. I'm going to take Theo for a walk. Don't criticize me! Watch it! What is he doing here? Changing diapers for someone else's baby? - Hello? - Hello. I thought he'd still be awake. He's been asleep for 40 minutes. You're right. I should've left the party earlier. - But it was so great! - That's what I figured. Well, I'm going to pump now. - Does it hurt? - It's torture.! I never felt such empathy for cows... Can I fix you something? Did you eat? No, thanks. Be right with you. but...Asunci?n? No, Asunci?n doesn't work for me anymore. - What happened? - She thought she was my boss. She would say things always judging me. And I needed her to take the baby to the studio... and she complained the stroller was too heavy for the subway... it was too far... and I need her to bring him... I have to nurse every two hours, or I'll explode! You get around the city well, you're free in the mornings. I can pay well and be flexible... We are friends! Let's try until September at least... But... it's not like I'm not doing anything until September. I have meetings with the director, rehearsals... you know how it is. I want to focus on the film now. And if it gets delayed again? How are you gonna live? It won't be pushed back again. I mean, I can't commit. I'll lend you a hand when I can, but I can't commit. Ok, that's fine. - How are you? - Tired. - How did it go? - Very good. Good. - Hi Nico. - Hi, how you doing? Are you hungry? No, I'm fine. I ate on the plane. Ok. - Do you want water? - Oh yes, please. Nico saved us that week. Theo loves him. Thanks man. It's ok. - Well. I'll be going. - Ok. Wait. No, no, no. - For the cab. - No. - Come on, it's late. - No, I'm on my bike. Don't worry. Really. Hi, I'm Daphne. What's your name? - Nico. - Welcome to This and That. - Hello! How are you? - Fine. And you? Fine, fine. - Oh, you shop a lot! - No, just a little. I had to buy two suitcases for all the shopping she did. - He's exaggeranting! - New York is for that! - Do you prefer this here, or there? - There. - Thank you. - Good trip. Goodbye. Teresa, listen, the couple that left were pigs. This is disgusting. They left the bathroom dirty, the pipes blocked... That's what I've got to tell you. And something else... I wanted to ask you if could stay two ou three nights... here in the apartment. I'll leave before the next guests come in. Is that Ok, please? Give me a call, let me know. Hi Nico. I hope your New York experience is paying off... It's been quite a long time. Enough. Well, we are closing on casting for the new "Rivales" season. You could still come back. Call me. Hi Nico. I hope your New York experience is paying off... It's been quite a long time. Enough. Well, we are closing on casting... What are you eating? Spaghetti with red sauce. And you? Chinese noodles in a cardboard box. In a cardboard box! Why? It's just like that. They're easy, quick, cheap. I love them. Are you Ok moneywise? Again?! Don't worry, I'm fine. I will start rehearsals soon, with the movie director. They will take care of my visa... we sign the contract they even pay the lawyer. What else can I ask for? But... why is that movie taking so long? Are you watching "Rivales"? Look, last season was dreadful without you. Listen. - Look at me. - What? You are a better actor than those guys. A lot better. You will have an international career. Thanks, mom. - Hello. - Hello. - Everything Ok? - Ok, fine. To return. - Do you have the receipts? - Yes. $90 change. Wants one store card or cash? Cash, please. Hi! Did you get my text? Pascal wants me to go to a work dinner with him tonight. I can't. I'm meeting Fernando at five. Go on. No, no go on. I have to be available for him. We can wait until 7:30. I might have a rehearsal, a camera test. I don't want to make any promises. I'll get you next time. - You know them well... - Yeah. I think he's starting to open up... he understands now what we think for the character. He told me how got here, how he crossed the border. He introduced me to his mother. She's amaizing. You should meet her. What's wrong? I come from a meeting whit the investors. They're interfering with the project. First, they've asked me to change the script. And now they want me to change the cast. They want names. They don't want non-actors. If it's a film about illegal immigrants... what names to they want? I don't get it. At the festival... all they did is say good things about you. They were excited, they said you weere the new promise... of Mexican cinema and now they've going back on their word. It's a downer. I don't know how to get around it. We'll have to push it... If we need to push it, we push it! We waited this long, we can wait a bit more and make it better! How long do you think we'll need to wait? Man, I know you come for this movie. You left Argentina for this project and... - I don't know what to tell you... - And the contract? What can I say, bro? I know this screws up your plans for the Visa. I know what you left behind. I brought you here. I feel terrible. Don't worry about it. I've got other things lined up too. Yeah? Yeah, sure. This isn't the only thing I've got. I wanted to make this movie with you. I want to make a movie with you. It's just that. At least you've got others offers. Yeah, sure. Of course, I have. - Hi Nico. - How did it go with Theo? - He slept at the time? - Yes, he's sleeping. Thanks again for coming above the time. It's Ok. Hey, if you want, from next week on, I'm free... I'm free next week. We interviewed a excellent babysitters. In fact, we find someone. Yes, but I can do it. I'm free. - Very good. - Yes - What happened? - They pushed back the movie again. Bummer. I thought you liked from yesterday. Yes, but, if he can, it's great. Sure. Ok. Let's think about it. Darling. Just do not cancel me last minute, right? If you are going to have any audition, tell me in advance. - Good. - Everything will be fine. - Sure. - Yeah. Everything will be fine. Great. Thank you. What's wrong? On top of this... Martin called... We haven't spoken in a year. You can't go back to "Rivales" with that asshole again. Please, I beg you. Martin Irazabal. Leave a message... Hi. Thanks for waiting. For the role of Stewart, wait here. For Miguel, come with me. Great! Oh, I'm sorry. Are you here for Miguel? Yes, or bicycle delivery boy? - Latin delivery boy? - Yes, I'm Latino. Do you speak Spanish? Yes, perfectly. I don't know, sorry. Speak Spanish. I don't want to waste your time. Thanks. But I have talent. Do not worry. No, ok. I don't want to take the director's time. I know what they want. That's right. Why don't you try with Stewart? - Very good. - In that room. Thank you. You can keep that one. Thank you. Next. Hi! Thanks... Excuse me, Kara Reynolds? - Yes? - Your car is down. - Thank you. - Wellcome. - Have a nice day. - Thanks, Kara. Nice day. Excuse me! - Kara Reynolds? - Yes. You don't have to remember me. We met two years ago. In Cannes. I was there with Fernando Silva. And I'm Andrea's friend too. Fernando and I were just talking about you. Yes, Fernando is very talented. Yes, we were going to work on his next movie together. - For you. - No, it's ok. Please, a little detail for her great movies. Ok, thank you. I hope it does not break. Do not blame me if it happens. Well, I'll give it back if it survives. - See you next week. - Very good. Good to see you again. What was that about, Nico? Yeah, I gave her my umbrella. P?ople come here to relax, not to network. I didn't even give her my headshot. She is a producer that I met at Cannes. Andrea, I have more class than that... it's raining, I gave her an umbrella. I don't mess with your work. You don't mess with mine. This is my workplace. Not here, Nico, ok? Ok. Very good. Bye darling! - Bye. - Bye. I leave you the "mate". Thanks. I'm going to work. I will bring someone in the night. - Ok? - Ok. - Good night. - Good night, see you later. I drank a lot of wine. Why do you laugh at me? What? So, the father tells him: "Son if you fail this exam... forget that I'm your father". The next day, the father greets him... "Good morning, son how are you?" And the son says, "Who are you?" - Do I have to explain it? - No, we got it. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I speak to you? - Yes. I've seen you in the park. I think you're a father. Sorry, he love soccer. - I've seen you play soccer. - Yes, I love soccer. - You are Italian? - No, I'm Argentine. - So, you speak Spanish. - Of course yeah. I go straight to the point. I'm looking for a nanny. Full time. I'm sorry, I can not. She wants a man. She wants someone who can play daddy... and teach him Spanish. My cousin is in London and she says they look... for Chinese nannies, so the kids lear Chinese. He needed a man as a nanny. He has a lot of energy. - I'd appreciate that. - Ok. I only know women nannies, not men. I'm sorry. He spends a lot of time with women. The girls used to have a Paraguayan maid... one day the mother wanted to show off... their Spanish with some friends... but one couldn't understand them, they were speaking Guarani! When I arrived 10 years ago... they didn't want me to speak Spanish to the kids. Now that I learned English... they want me to speak only Spanish. - Wait there. - I'll call you back. I'll be back Can you leave that out? We don't want bedbugs. - Helo. - Nico, bro! - Pablo, dear! How is it going? - Fine. You? - I'm good. - I'm in Miami. Yes, I knew that you're filming in Miami. - That's great! - I wanna see you! - You are comming to New York? - Yes, tonight! - Tonight? - Is there a problem? No, you just catch me by surprise, but it's great. Where will you be staying? I was hoping to stay with you, so we can hang out. Yeah... I'll text you my address. Sure, no problem. Did you put the milk in the microwave? - Yeah. - You can not do that. What? Microwaves kill antibodies. Also it does not control the temperature. You have to think about those things. You want to burn the baby, right? You have to use that. So you can control the temperature. Leave it two minutes. Nothing else. Baby. Theo. Theo. - He's hungry. - Yeah, he is. Theo, baby. Everything is alright. No, it's ok. Leave him with me. - Ok. - Very well. I can not do it. I have to finish a call. Hi! - Hello darling. - Hello, love. Well, I must be going. - Bye. Bye baby. - Bye. In fact, you must reconsider. Nico, come on. I think you should sign up. My cousin is practically in order that the vacancy for you. It's a good job. And you will solve your visa situation. You have to stop with that crazy race. trying to make money to survive. What? Did your friend can not afford a hotel? Is not he in a show? I can not send him to a hotel. Why? He's more than your friend? No really, but... Never mind. I can not find my shirt. My red shirt ... - I was cleaning. - Ok. Tell your cousin, thank you, for me. But... I can't. I didn't leave Buenos Aires to go to Iowa. But you are going to work with kids. You would be teaching Spanish through a theater. Come on! It's a perfect job for you. You should not live like that. There is no way to live like that. Briana agrees. What does Briana have to do with this? If you need a place, let me know. Can I take it? My surfboard? You do not surf. - Hey, handsome. - How's it going? - How are you? - Good. Great to see you. - Open this. It's for you. - Take off your shoes. I'm exhausted. I couldn't hold it anymore. Nice. I was thinking, how long since I last saw you? - Ages! - Ages! Unbelieveble. as soon as I realized it was Halloween I got a ticket. Sure. No, you did the right thing. - Hey, thanks for the whisky. - You're welcome. Open it! I just moved in. I'm setting in. - It's good, no? - Good location. What are you, a surfer? Or is it just for show? Yes it is! No, it's a friends. Look who's talking Doing things for show. That's right. - What are you going? - What? - No, you can't smoke here. - Why not? - Because you can't. - I'll open the window. No, you can't smoke. - How do I look? - Can't see your face. It's spetacular, look. - What if we go here? - There? Forget it. Friday without a reservation, impossible. - How is it impossoble? - It's impossible. - Who is going to say no to us?! - No, but it's far away. We've got all night. But why, if there are thousands of places nearby? Because if you always go here I imagine it must be good, right? You want to go there? - Welcome to Northern Territory. - Thank you. - Hey. - Hey. This is Pablo, my friend from Argentina. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. She is Tikki. - Do you want a table? - Yes. - Ok. - Thank you. Let's go. You're so sneaky! What do you drink? - Great, I'll bring them. - Thank you. This is what I need, a little bit of freedom, please. Imagine if we were in Buenos Aires, paparazzi everywhere you go... someone asking you for a photo, a selfie. It gets to the point where it's annoying. No one knows you here. And if they do I'd drop dead. Here are two Old Fashioned. - Have a nice night. - Thank you. Looks like I'll be getting some chocolate tonight. Pace yourself, it's not like back home here. You need to tie your hands here! Don't you miss it? People greeting you in the street, recognizing you. I have freedom, more privacy. If you come back to "Rivales" we'll be total hit! I won't go back to "Rivales". Hey, you brought me good luck! - More likes? - No, nothing like that. I don't believe it! She's a top producer here. - She wants to see me on Monday. - Great! - She texted Andrea. - Great! Take me with you. What do you mean? You have to go to Miami. I can blow them off. I'm joking, you idiot! I don't believe it! Are you Pablo from "Rivales"? Can we take a photo with you? - Hey, are you in "Rivales" too? - Sure. He's the one who's in a coma? Oh yes! Please, let's take a selfie. Come on! - Hi! - How's it going? You've been smoking. You got anything for a headache? No, eat some of this. It'll do you good, coffee. You frightened me. You've got nothing in the fridge. We lost you. I don't spend much time here. You don't even make yourself a coffee. Oh, that's not right. This is tasty. I was just thinking, don't Yankees ever sit down for breakfast? They eat in the subway. While they drive. In the elevator. Can't they relax a little? Don't they take a shit after eating? I think they don't. That's why they're so stiff. Maybe... It was good last night, right? - It was good. - Amazing, Halloween is crazy. Everyone's really nuts. If you think about it, anyone could do anything at any time. Crazy. What are we doing today? I've got to be somewhere. If you want to do something. - I'll call Tikki then. - Look. Maybe I'll stay a few more days. What happened with the guy in the mask? He was a tease, I got bored. - Hello! - Hello! - You leaving? - I'm afraid so. Your cousin keeps me on a short leash. But you should be grateful, you've got Kara fucking Reynolds... for yourself now, no competition. - Much better. - Much better. Sorry to leave this mess, but I won't make it otherwise. Here. They're too small for me. But if you bought them with a credit card. I can return them. They'll reimburse the money. What if I want you to try them on, see if you like them? Try them on. - Thank you. - Do you like them? Yeah, they're great. And a good brand. I needed this. Look who's calling. - Hello? - Pablo! - Martin, how's it going? - How are you? Fine, fine. Yeah, no worries, thanks. - I'm fine. - You got sick? Oh, a hot dog, that crap, the spicy sauce disagreed with me. There's no need to send a doctor, don't be silly. - You know who's here? - With whom? - Mr. Nicol?s Lencke. - How is he? He's looking great. He's doing very well. I tell you something repatriate him... because he's on his way up and you won't be able to get him again. - Really? - I know what I'm talking about. - You wanna say hi? - Yes, sure. I'll put him on. He wants to say hi. - Hello. - Finally. How are you? How's it going? Al right, all good. We need to talk. Yeah. Sure, let's talk. Whenever you like. All right, big hug. Bye. Hey, sorry dude. Come on, he's your cousin! What's up? What's the matter? Tell me. He sent you. No, I came because I wanted to see you. Don't look at me like that, I have no idea what's going on between you two. You know what I'm gonna tell him? That you will be starring an HBO series. and in 5 minutes, he will be here to take you back. As competitive as he is... Help me with this, please. Thanks for coming. - Thank you. - Have a good trip. All the best for tomorrow. I was in the primetime shows for two seasons. "Rivales" happened in throughout Latin America. Also some movies. "Pudor" was what was in Cannes. What was the result at home? Excellent. I won as best actor. Cool. And why did you come here? I felt ready for new challenges. So, what have you been doing? I have been preparing with Fernando Silva. I was a soccer coach. who trains a team of illegal migrants. I told Andrea that I could not do much. by a non-American actor. But here is my advice. Shoot the scenes of the TV... and leave the scenes of the film let to play. I understand. And you have to improve your accent. Yes, I know. Of course. I can recommend you a speech coach. It's not cheap, they're like $ 200 an hour... but you will be very happy, long-term. You can audition in a few months. Good. Do you try on Univision? I don't want those novels. - Would you rather be babysitting? - Yes. The sad truth, Nico, nobody cares... if you are a star in your country. But on the other hand, you got lucky. There is an excellent talent in Latinos. But you need to work in your look. - And you could be proud. - No, I just ... You can be shy or proud. Listen, I don't lose anybody's time. including yours. Then, exercise routine, forget your accent. And darken your hair. - Hello? - Nico... Mart?n? What's up? Pablo told me that you had a great time together. Yeah. Where are you calling from? I'm in Los Angeles, but will be in New York soon. Ah, I couldn't recognize the number. I hear a baby? You had a baby and didn't tell me? No, I'm on set on a shoot. There's a baby in it. With his mom. - Oh, you scared me. - So, when are you coming? - The day after tomorrow. - Ok. You're saying, Mart?n comes to New York. and I refuse to have a drink with him? Obviously! But... if he has a role for me? Something in Argentina? But you don't want to go back to Argentina. Much less with him. You are dying to see him... That's what it is. You know it upsets me... that I have nothing to show for my time here... If I get this role, great... I've done it! But... I can't believe you are still waiting for him to see you. Let's go over the lines... C'mon "Brunette", are you ready? Don't make fun of me. If you get the part, what will you do about the Visa? I don't know yet. I'm focusing on the audition now. But you told Kara about your situation, right? No. I think you should tell her. I think that if they pick me, she can draft a contract. and I"ll get money for the lawyer. You should've married Jeff. He was so in love with you. Very much. But I wasn't. Thanks. I wanted to call you to thank you for the opportunity... For the audition great. I think I got it. So, thank you Kara. Thanks so much. Give me a call. Bye. Scott was intrigued. I saw how you were looking at him. I bet he's going to ask who you are. The party was great. Thank you. Yes, it was good. We are move, left on time. I did not want to look nervous. You were wonderful. All the men were look at you. So... Any chance? - What do you mean? - I mean... I have chance to act in some movies? Maybe. Where are we going next? So tell me, is it a big movie? It's a big movie, but I can't tell ypu about it yet. If I get the part and the movie is released... I'll invite you to the premiere. - Ok. - Will you come? Yes, of course! With whom are you going to celebrate? With Jeff? No, I don't see him anymore. No... But... there is somebody. I know you. Well mom... I have to wake up early tomorrow. I need some rest. What are you doing tomorrow? Something new? Tell me... Yes, I have a meeting. Bye mom, we'll talk soon. - A meeting with whom? - Nobody. Goodnight. - Hi. - Hello! - Are you Nico? - Yeah. - Another resident. - What? Hi, Petra. I'm pet sitter. - What kind of animals? - I taked tiger, parrot... I work more mainly with cats. Do you like cats? I don't pay rent a year ago, Nico. - You should try it. - No. I'm allergic to cats. Tulum? You don't see more Mexicans there. It's beautiful. It's facing the sea. We live there of grace. We just need to work. You can work at the bar, swim, teach yoga. Ok. Allright. I can do swans with the napkin. Great. So simple, wonderful. It does'nt sound good? - No thanks. - How about you? I can't travel. Why? Are you allergic to flying or something? No, my visa expired. Oh, I'm sorry. What going do? Are you going home? No, I was thinking of getting married. - What? Ok. - You're getting married? - You came back with Jeff? - No, with Jeff, no. Yes? I know what your favorite food is. Your toothbrush, the password of your computer. Only for documents Briana. Don't worry. It's not funny, Nico. - Ok. - It's not funny. - Ok. - It's strange. Mart?n Irazabal. Leave a message... Mart?n... Kara, how are you? You have an event today ... I have a friend coming from Buenos Aires. He's just going to be here alone tonight. Sorry. - Just, I can't. - Ok. Kara, do you know or have known about the movie? Not yet. The agency will contact you. - Ok, Kara. - Ok. - Bye, Nico. - Ok. Bye Mart?n, where are you? I'm waiting for you. I won't make it to the hotel. The meeting was delayed. I've changed the flight. I only have a couple of hours. Cousin! How are you. How's it going? What? You look good. Yeah? Very. You look good too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Pablo said you're working with Kara Reynolds. - Yeah. - That's great. - It's brilliant. - Really good. She's really good, she's a star. She has lots of contacts in the industry. Very generous. She introduces me to people. She's been getting me auditions. Good. She's like a godmother to me, she's put me under her wing. I'm happy. What were you doing in Los Angeles? I'm doing a co-production with a Fox. - Look at that. - Big program. - Great. - International cast. A Colombian, a Mexican, maybe a Yank. I heard that when I left "Rivales" the ratings plummeted. Plummeted? No, they dropped a little. A little? Three points today is not a little. You put me in a coma! You wanted to leave. You slammed the door. I had to look after the program, you wanted to come and do a movie. I let you go and left the door open. I didn't come here to make a movie. Mart?n, are you kidding? I got tired of always trying to find a space... between you, your job, your family. I understand, but... But that's done. I'm fine here. I did the right thing. Do you party? Of course I do. A lot? I party hard. Yes, I do. Slowly, Ok? Slowly. Slowly, Mart?n. I like it. I missed you. I love you. I'm not well here. Come back. To what? I'll be there. Hi, honey. Yeah, just about to board. Hello, my little princess. Are you waiting for me? You know what daddy's got for you? - Oh, what happened? - Nothing. - You Ok? - Yeah. - Did something happen with Mart?n? - No, nothing to do with Mart?n. Listen, Pascal's got time off. We're going to spend the day together as a family. Get some rest. Take care. Bye. Yes, I... I would like to speak to Kara Reynolds. About the movie. I auditioned a few days ago ... Nicolas Lencke. Nicolas L-E-N-C-K-E. - Hi. - Hi. She's only going to be here tonight. Let's put it in the box. The apartment she cares for is under renovation. Men hammering ... the cat is scared. - She needed us to bring her. - Don't worry. - All right? - Yeah all right. I can bring you an antihistamine. - You can sleep without problem. - Don't worry. - Ok? - It's ok. In this case, you're going to be fine. He is good with these children. Yes, because it has a rhythm of its own. Looks great. Thanks. How you been? I'm fine. Jeff. I wanted to thank. For being generous with me. I was in love with you. I have studied Spanish. It's complicated that thing, especially of "estar y" being. Something like " estoy triste" or "soy triste". It's complicated. "Ser" is permanent. You know? "Estar" is circumstantial. So, you "tu est?s en New York". "Pero, t? eres de Buenos Aires". No, you mean ... I'm from Buenos Aires. "Yo soy de...Buenos Aires." No, it's not what I mean. Hello? Hello! Nico, is that you? Bye. Hello, Nico! Sorry we're late. - Hello. - He didn't sleep. I think he's got a fever. Yeah, it's because he's teething. Give him a lozenge. I have to be right on time. Can you bring him at 10? Do you really think it's best for him to take him? It's a very good school. They start very early, it's all very competitive, you know. You do all this yoga and spirituality... but you have your son complete to get into a preschool. - Makes no sense. - What do you know? Stop, Nico, stop. You're worse than Asunci?n, you stick your nose in, judge me. In the end, Pascal was right. Oh yeah? What does Pascal say? That you can't face your failure. That you hide behind our son. And you play daddy with him. - Give him to me. - Hang on. Give me my son. You're using my son to steal! Give him to me! No, but it was just some cookies, a chocolate... The place is full of cameras. No one watches the cameras. Nobody's watching. You're hoping to be kicked out to go back to Buenos Aires? I'm sorry, I won't do it again. Do you need money? I can give your money. - You're right. - Give him to me. I'll take care of Theo. What happens to Theo if they call the police? He goes to a precinct with you? Or do they leave him here with a stranger until I come? - Didn't you think of him?! - Calm down, Andrea. - Forgive me. - You're pathetic. - You know I look after him. - Yes, I know you do. Give him to me. Give him to me. Sorry, vote this. I cant trust you anymore. Which do you like? This? Do you like this? Ok. - I need you to take it there. - Yeah, do not worry. Just a minute. Be careful. Easy cash: Looking for broken umbrellas for art project. $1 each. Nico? - Hi! - Hello! - I thought it was you! - Yes. Hi. What are you up to? Waiting for a child. He's in preschool. He'll be out in a half an hour. And how is Theo? No, I don't take care of him anymore. And your acting career? How is it going? It's not going. And the nannies? How are they? Do you see them? I don't see them much... Just Marina. Oh, send her my love. And that tree, are you getting ready for Christmas? No... no Christmas for me. So good to see you! - How are you, all right? - All right. - I thought you weren't comming. - Of course I came. I wanted you to know that I don't get why Mart?n did that. I was so happy when I heard you were coming back. I thought we would work together again. I don't get him. - You know how producers can be. - Let's forget it and try to enjoy. Have fun. Come in. I'll introduce you. - Nico Lencke. - Hi! What's up. Good afternoon. How are you? Sit down. Please make some room for him. - Hello everyone. - Take a chair. Let's move this. There we go. An applause for the cook. Thank you. My pleasure. And a toast for Nico, who just arrived. - No, come on! - Yes! - Welcome back, cousin! - Congratulations! Merry Christmas! Happy Holidays! And to Pablo, Mart?n and season 4 of "Rivales"! A success! We'll be big! Mart?n, thank you for putting an end to my coma and killing me. Spending so much time in bed in a coma was difficult! Now let's see what I reincarnate as... Nico, you're over for the holidays? No, I just come over. - Permanently? - You never know... Did you act a lot? I did some acting but nothing you can see... - Not even on internet? - Everything is online! Show us! I love New York. - You like it? I was there last year... I almost stayed... was in doubt... - Whether to stay, or not. - Where did you live? In Williamsburg... Oh! Go to Williamsburg for your grilled veggies! I knew he would make fun of me! How is the movie going? Are you writing? I'm finishing and still looking for investors. In the meantime I'm directing theater. You should come by the studio. Yes. Sure. Come on. Nobody's watching. You get into bed, turn on the TV... But watching TV isn't what it used to be... - You're not staying the night? - I can't. Really? There's tons of space, come on! I want to get to Rosario, spend Christmas with my mother. Can I give you a lift to the station? No, no need. Cousin, I can't let you take the bus! I'm not your cousin, quit it. Thank you. See you.
