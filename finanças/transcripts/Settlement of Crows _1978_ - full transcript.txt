Stories Of A Little Hunter From The Stone Age Part One Ancient and silent is the face of Earth. But even a single stone has its memory?s. It's a witness of life on earth and its countless metamorphoses. After long evolution, a human comes and gives the stone a form. The roughly trimmed rock is a small miracle of a human will. The first sharp working tools, which served humans both helped and killed. A stone is transformed into a bear's claw, a wolf's tooth, an eagle's beak. And launched by the power of a stretched bow it lengthens the arms of hunters into the middle of herds for which human legs weren't enough. In this form, a stone has its secrets. Maybe prehistoric man hid his faith and hope in them in the power of nature which he didn't understand and which he was afraid. Relics about life, human spirit and a culture of people. Maybe this dish was a witness of a similar story to that which our film tells. SETTLEMENT OF CROWS from the novel by Edward Storch Director: Jan Schmidt Stop! Be hailed sun, father of all life.

Give fertility. Give power. Give grain. Mother Earth, you who maintains us cures us and sustains us feed us. The river brought him. He is not one of us. You found him, he's yours. Let the House of Falcons care for him. He's hungry. Why feed another mouth? But it's a child. A wolf kills her cubs when she has no food for them. Do you have meat, grain or honey? Will you reduce your share? What will you give to him? Let's kill him. Wait! The Father of Ravens doesn't want him to die. Give him to the women. Where are you from, puppy? You want to bite me? Bite me, rip me! He's like a wolf. Just snarl, you'll be a man. Come here, youngster. Feed him. Hunger. There will be hunger. Junk! Veverice, don't interfere. Do you want him? What's your name? Havranpirko "Raven-Feather" You want to hunt? Back to work. A fox! Havranpirko! Sokole! Were you scared? Pay attention death doesn't give any warning. How did you fake the animal tracks? I'll never be a great hunter like you. Or like Divous. A hunter grows up slowly. Do you want to try it? Wait. No hurry. Wait for him to come down. Look, Father of Ravens, I hunted it down. Lies! It's not your arrow! Give it here! Sokole killed it. Not you. Don't fight! Raven is coming! Don't punish them Father of Ravens don't be angry at your house. Wait, Veverice. You can't hunt. You like it? Sokole he says he killed the falcon. Is it true? Your arrow was in it. Havranpirko doesn't lie. He killed the falcon. Don't go back, Father will be mad. You fought too. Wait. You stained the sacred place by fighting. Now show how you can stand pain. Come for your death. Die!! Boars!! Boars! Boars! Wake up! Wake up! Boars! Boars! No time! Do it. Wake up! Let's go. Havranpirko guard the women. Go. Come... Come for your death! Die!! Divous may be the best hunter, but my axe is the most beautiful. Let it go! Do you hear me? Thieves! Robbers! Let it go! Do you hear me? Havranpirko! Shut up! Stand still! You will come with us! With me!! No!!! Let her go! Didn't you hear me? Veverice, run! You killed him! He killed Havranpirko! I'll kill anyone who stands in my way!! I wish the black death upon you. Where is Veverice? They've taken her. And the calf is gone, too. You were the guard. You didn't protect us! It's your fault. I'll get help. Raven! Divous! Divous! Raven! What happened? They've kidnapped Veverice. They've stolen a calf. Home, quickly! Help him. Wait. Wait. Look after him. He has to get to the big river. No. Catch the calf! You'll be mine whether you like it or not. They must have a boat. Look for it. To the river! Sokole, here! Thieves! Drown! At least we got the calf. Look out! Will he come? No. He's a falcon. He will fly. Merchants! Merchants! Merchants! Accept this gift, Raven so good will rule. Welcome. We offer salt, flints and cloth. We'll give you skins, honey, and finished clothing. I agree. Very well. A hunter kills with one shot. Salt! Too little! Add more. Flints. Two. That many. That's too many. I'm giving you my best skins. I will sell to another merchant! Give them to him. Move. Next! Show me. Do you have more such stones? Who gave you these? I don't know. They came down the big river with me. Come with me. Gold, pure gold! Check this out. Take! All! He's said all. Take it! Salt, who wants more salt? You've lost your mind. Even Divous didn't get so much. Salt, who wants my salt? What are you staring at? Get lost. He needs meat mashed up or he will die. Where are you going? No! You can't do that. He's hungry. Why can't I hunt ravens? They are fathers of our fathers. Not mine. I was brought by a flood. You're a Raven now. Did you bring meat? There's not a single squirrel in the woods. Head on back. Raven! There's hunger! Open up the granary! Raven! I divided all grain fairly. Every cottage got its share. Even you, Divous. Let's kill the cow. And we'll all eat. Do you hear me? One cow! One cow wouldn't be enough! And we must wait for calves! So open the granary! - Yes! - Give us grain! No! Not all will survive the winter. Maybe not even me. But the grain must be our seed crop! If not for us then for our children. Go back to your fires. What are you waiting for? Should I chase you off like dogs? I'll kill anyone who tries to touch the grain. I'll Kill... I'll kill... Father of Ravens, remember! Every time I gave you meat from every prey, blood still hot... the best piece to you... and you... Now is when you should help me to not die from hunger you don't listen to my requests. Give me back the strength of hunter. Give me at least little mouse. Do you hear me? Come closer. Don't be afraid, boy. Thief! I've caught a thief! He's stolen our grain. Judge him. Say something! Speak! He can't. Like a punched marmot. Your Havranpirko! And I haven't said the worst yet. Is anything worse than robbing your own house? No! I didn't kill it! Not me! He's not a Raven anymore. He has no roof. He has no fire. No one knows him. It's not true. Veverice. It's not true. Havranpirko. Havranpirko. I've got a clue. I've got it. Come, come with me. Where do you want to go? Sun, there, big. Havranpirko. Nod at me. I'm coming! Coming... Wait. Havranpirko is dying. You won't tell anyone. You robbed... You killed the raven. I'll rip your tongue out for this. Let me go! You're leaving at sunrise. Come home, boy. He was the best hunter. They'll die without fire. They'll die without a house. How many arrows? I have nothing more to teach you. You are a hunter of the house.
