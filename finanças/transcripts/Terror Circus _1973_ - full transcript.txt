(intense music) (eerie orchestral music) (horn honking) (eerie orchestral music) - Hey, look what I've got. - Oh, I am so thirsty I could die. It's not cold. - But it's wet. - You got a great gas station, and you don't have any towels in your ladies room. - Why don't you get your act together? - What do you mean, towels? - [Corrine] Towels, T-O-W-E-L-S. - I'll get my act together. - Ooh, fellas! - Nice. Which one you want? - I like the driver. - Okay, I'll take the other two. - Listen, you got a bad thermostat. You want to fix it? - Can we make it to Las Vegas? - You'd be taking a chance. I think you oughta stay here with me and Jesse, go to the circus. (girls laughing) What's the matter with that? (engine sputtering) Sure, try that. - [Sheri] Hey, the little one with the mustache is kinda cute. - [Simone] You gotta be kidding. You hear what he said? - You think we really have trouble with the radiator? - Nah, I don't think so. He was just saying that 'til we go to the circus or whatever else he had in mind. I don't know. - Maybe they're in the circus. - You believe they're the elephants? - Crazy. - We're on our way to Las Vegas, I know a really neat shortcut. You guys wanna try? It's down here about seven miles. Okay? (dramatic music) ♪ Evil eyes ♪ Hypnotize ♪ Satan glows ♪ Devil is the man ♪ Night must fall ♪ Darkness calls ♪ Satan shows ♪ Devil is the man ♪ You're possessed by a relentless demon ♪ ♪ I can't rest knowing you're worth redeeming ♪ ♪ Pray with me ♪ Stay with me ♪ Heavens knows ♪ Devil is the man ♪ Heaven knows ♪ Devil is the man (smooth jazz music) - [Sheri] This is it. I'm positive it is. ♪ Going down the highway - [Sheri] Okay, I think you turn now. - [Simone] You think or you know? Why don't you heck on the map? - [Sheri] I know you turn that way, I remember this. This is a fantastic shortcut. It's gonna save us at least (engine drowns out speech). (girls laughing) (smooth jazz music) You'll both thank me. - [Simone ] Right, and if we break down in the middle of the desert, we'll really thank you. (laughs) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) - [Corrine] What's the matter with this car? - [Simone] I don't know. Now what? (engine sputtering) - What's the matter with this car? - I don't know. - [Sheri] Man, it's cold out here. - Oh god, look at this! - What is it? - [Simone] I don't know, I think it's the radiator. (girls scream) Son of a bitch! (door slams) Look at this car! (Simone crying) - [Corrine] What did you do? What a job. - [Simone] Oh god dammit. Oh god, it's cold. - [Sheri] I don't believe this. - [Simone] I don't know how to fix it. I haven't the faintest idea what we're going to do. - [Sheri] This is really scary. - [Simone] Just lock the doors, roll up the windows, and try to sleep. - [Corrine] I was looking forward to a nice, hot bath in Vegas. - [Simone] C'est la vie. - [Sheri] Our first night and we have to stay here. - That's life in the big city, folks. (dramatic music) (screams) Who the hell are you? What the hell do you mean, scaring us like that? - I saw your hood up, I thought somebody might be in trouble, so I stopped to help, alright? - [Simone] Alright. - Now, what seems to be the trouble? - [Simone] I don't know. Something's wrong with the radiator. - [Andre] Radiator, huh? - Yeah. - You're lucky you've got a radiator left. - That's show biz. Any chance of getting us out of here? - Of course. - Something interest you? - Yes, actually, it's not everyday that I see three beautiful girls out here in the desert. - We were trying a shortcut. - Oh. Now, how best to solve your problem? I think first, we gotta get you outta this wind, and get you to a telephone. - Well, we certainly appreciate anything you can do for us, mister? - Just call me Andre. Listen, come on over to the Jeep. - [Simone] What about our things? - Leave everything here, just bring what you need. Nobody ever comes out here anyway. - [Simone] Get my purse, will ya? - [Sheri] And get my hairbrush, please. - At least, almost never. - Here you go. - Thanks. (girls cheering) - Well, isn't he cute? What did he say his name was? - [Simone] Andre. - All aboard. (upbeat music) (girls laughing) You girls make yourselves comfortable. I've got to get something out of the house. - [Sheri] Okay. - Wow, what a weird place this is. - Look at this fantastic cat. - Hi baby! - Nasty little thing. - I don't think he likes us. - Hello. (cougar hisses) What kind of cat is that? - [Corrine] I don't know. Why's he got that cat in a cage? - Why's he got that cat at all? - Look, circus signs. - Let's go in the barn. - You wanna? Maybe he's got some more animals in there. - I don't want to go in there, okay? - Come on, we've got to wait for him anyway. - It's colder than hell out here. - Come on. (cougar hisses) Maybe we could use it in our act. This is the funniest thing I've ever seen. I've never been in a barn before. And I hope I'm never in one again. - I wonder if this guy is some kind of a snake freak, man. - This is terrific, it looks just like your apartment, Simone. - No it doesn't, mine's got more soul. - Hey, let's not go in there, okay? - Don't worry about it, I'll take care of you. Have no fear, Sheri's here. - You're going to take care of me? - After you, after you. - The great taker care, you're the one that got us lost. (dramatic music) Oh my god. - They're going to have a party tonight but they're not going to get to go. No, they're never going to get to come. Because I don't want them, they're bad. Bad men. They're always mean to me. (dramatic music) - What is this? - I think we better get out of here. - My god, is this some kind of a joke? Are they dead-- - Sheri! - Come on! (dramatic music) - Now, where am I going to put the three of you? - My house has a lot of big rooms. That's gonna be mine and daddy's. Maybe we'll have a big yard too. (redhead coughs) Nice big kitchen. Where we can play. Have a family. (chained woman humming) - Where are we? - In a circus. - A circus? You gotta be kidding. How long have you been here? - I think two months. She's been here six. - He's coming down the road. Daddy's coming. Daddy's coming down the road to the house. - Doesn't anybody ever get out of here? - Why are we all here? - He wants to control us. He's like all the other men. And I hate him. - We're his toys, his pets, his animals. - How did you get here? - Our car broke down in the desert, so we spent the night in it. And the next morning, Andre came to the window. Scared the hell out of us. Then he seemed real nice. He asked us if we wanted to use the phone and we said sure. - And he had nice eyes. - Yeah. - That's it. Derek. When we don't show up in Las Vegas Derek will come looking for us. He'll find the car. Corrine, listen, don't worry about it. Derek will come and he'll get us out of here. (laughs) - Derek won't come for us. Did anybody come for them? - What does he do to you? - I don't know. Nobody knows. You'll find out when your time comes. - I know what will happen. He wants us to want him. He wants us to need him. He wants to know everything we're thinking. (dramatic music) He watches us. (dramatic music) (wood creaking) - Get over on your own side! (Andre grunts) (eerie music) (door creaks) (upbeat psychedelic music) - There's only one thing I can't tolerate, and that's someone not living up to their obligations. If I have a contract with you then I expect it to be honored. - Look, Phil, I'm sure we can reach an understanding. - Understanding? There's only one thing to understand. I gave you a fat advance to bring those girls over here. I want you to find them, produce the act, I'm seeing my attorney. - Look, Phil, I told you the girls are missing. I got every cop in the state looking for them. - Like I told you, you don't find them, you'll never show your face, or any part of your body, in this town again. Rice peddlers, all these agents. - Phil, we you take me to Circus Circus tonight? I really want to see the show. - For you dear... Circus tonight. (eerie music) - Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep in step. Shut up. Keep in step. (eerie violin music) Alright, walk faster. Move around, faster, keep moving! (eerie music) When I tell you raise your arms for four footsteps and then you'll lower them for four footsteps. Now! (whistle blows) (eerie music) Raise them! (whip cracks) Lower them! (whip cracks) Do what I tell you! Raise them, now! Do as I tell you! (whip cracks) (woman whimpering) (eerie music) (shotgun blasts) - Missed the son of a gun. - Oh, that's too bad. - Okay, give me a little of that sauce. (dramatic music) - Did you hear something? - I didn't hear anything. (branches cracking) - Hey, there it is again. Keep it, I'll be right back. (dramatic music) - Oh no! (dramatic music) (screams) - I'm cold. I'm freezing. (sobs) I'm freezing. - I want to give her my blanket. - No, we need them ourselves. - You didn't finish telling me what brought you here. - I was working in a lab in L.A. on radio activity and I heard that this part of the desert was part of the nuclear test sight. So I came out here to do some tests on cell mutation on animals and plants and that's when I met Andre. (deep moaning) - What was that? - I don't know. (woman coughing) - You know that girl is really sick? - Look, just eat your food and remain calm because you'll need your energy when it comes time for the performance. - What performance? - I don't know, forget about it. - [Sheri] I can't take just sitting here not knowing what's going to happen to us. (low moaning) Those noises are horrible. What are they? I'm so glad it's dark and we can't see those freaks. - [Corrine] Is this what we have to look forward to? Crazy like that one? Pacing back and forth like her, or that one. - [Sheri] We can't let that happen to us, Corrine. - [Simone] What did that girl mean when she talked about a performance? - [Corrine] What performance? - She said something about a circus and he thinks we're all animals. - Animals in a circus? - He can't be that crazy. - Oh, yes he can. - [Sheri] He can't! - [Corrine] Simone? Simone, what is he going to do to us? What is he going to do to us? - I don't know! (low moaning) - That girl's been here for six months. - And she's crazy! - Six months, I couldn't stand it! - We gotta keep it together. We're not going to go crazy in here. - Players! - [Karene] It's dinner time. - We had some visitors today. Men. You wouldn't want any of them around, would you? They have such strange habits. That's better. Now you're learning some manners. Are you hungry today? I thought you might be. You're a hungry little girl, aren't you? Oh. (laughs) (eerie music) - 898-7200, please. Phil Langley. Phil, yeah, Phil. Listen, this is Moore. No, no I don't. No, I don't. Naturally, I'm worried about what might have happened to them, but I'm concerned about them. Right? I don't know where they are. Phil, look, I know you have to cancel. I know that. But I'm worried about them. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to double back tomorrow morning and see if I can find them. Yeah. Well, I've already talked to the police in Nevada and California, no trace. Phil, I understand your situation. Okay. Alright. Okay, Phil. Thanks. Yeah, good night. - Here's something for my little bears. You know in the circus they train bears to do tricks for their food? I'm going to teach the two of you a little trick. Now, something for my little doe. Now, you must eat. You must. Good. Good. So quiet for so long. You all belong to me now. You know, you mustn't fight me. (wind whooshing) - The keys. - Keys? Keys! - The keys! - Where? Where? - The keys, they're right there. Honey, the keys! Put out your hand, you can reach the keys. Listen to me! The keys! Please, get the keys. Put your hand over. (dramatic music) (woman shouting) - I got it. - Hurry, hurry, Marlene. (women shouting) (dramatic music) - Were you going to run out on me? Were you going to run out on me? (hand cracks) (dramatic music) (whip whooshes) (women gasping) (whip cracking) (Marlene groaning) (dramatic music) I'm your trainer! You obey me, and you'll be part of the greatest animal menagerie in history. But if you disobey, you will suffer! (dramatic music) Tomorrow. Tomorrow. (dramatic music) - Operator. Yeah, this is Moore in 165. Tell the desk to have my bill ready, I'm checking out. Yeah, okay. (upbeat psychedelic music) - Your license, please. - Look, officer, the reason I was speeding is that I'm looking for three missing girls. - Yeah, me too. - No, I'm serious. Look, I'm an agent, and those three missing girls are my clients. That's why I'm driving up and down the highway here looking for them. - Are you serious about that? - Of course I'm serious. As a matter of fact, I'd like to file a missing persons report. - Okay, okay, we can take care of that. - Good. - I'm still going to have to give you a ticket though. (dramatic drum music) - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the greatest and most astonishing trained animal act ever to be presented under the big top. It will be our humble pleasure to dazzle and delight you with a series of feats unequaled in the history of the circus world. But first, it's my unpleasant task to remove from my well trained menagerie the untrainable, the unmanageable, the dangerous, and the brutal. There is one such animal among us today. Who is it? You! - No! (woman sobs) No! No! No! No! - [Woman] Let her go! (woman screaming) (woman sobbing) - No! (dramatic music) - She'll escape. She'll escape! She will! She'll escape! (woman sobbing) (cougar hissing) - I don't need to use this, do I? Huh? - No! - I thought not. Here, put this on. (cougar hisses) - That's not paint. - No, it's calf's blood. - Blood, why? - I couldn't let you go without it. - Let me go? You're going to let me go? - Of course. - When? - In just a minute. - What about my sister? And the others? - They'll follow you soon. Just like all the others. - You let them go? - Yes. And now, my little one, if you want to live, run. Run! (dramatic music) (cougar hisses) (dramatic music) Run! Run! (dramatic music) (laughs) (dramatic music) (woman gasping) (woman screams) (dramatic music) (upbeat psychedelic music) - Hello, Sheriff Graham? This is Derek Moore. Yeah. Listen, have you found any trace of them? No. Well, I haven't found them either. Listen, I'll tell you what, sheriff, if you find them tell them... Nevermind. No, it's alright. I'll talk to you later. Okay, thank you, bye bye. (dramatic music) (tinny musical box music) - When I was a very small boy I was afraid of the dark. So I listened to a music box. I didn't feel so alone. (Andre humming) (dramatic music) - [Young Andre Voiceover] Father, father what happened? What happened to your face? - [Father] Get away from me. Don't touch me! - [Young Andre Voiceover] The men told us not to go near their testing site. - [Father] You and your mother. - [Young Andre Voiceover] I'll take care of you until mother comes back. - [Woman] Andre, you'll never have it happen. Andre, you'll never have it happen. (distorted voice chattering) (dramatic music) - At last, you've come back. I never thought I'd see you again. I didn't even recognize you. Here. I'll get you away from the animals. They smell so bad. I'm afraid you'll find that things have change a lot around here in the last few years. The circus and all, it's been very difficult here alone. I didn't even recognize you. Why do you use another name? Why didn't you tell me who you are? - Leave her alone! God, you're crazy! We're not the animals, you are! You're repulsive, you're nothing but a degenerate! - You dare insult me? In front of my mother! - No! (dramatic music) No! (Sheri screams) - [Sheri] Oh god no, please! (Sheri screaming) - Come. - Sheri! Sheri! Help me! (sobs) - There, now isn't that better? 10 years. Time twisting so. But I never gave up hope. And now you're here. You haven't changed at all. When you went to Chicago father said that it was my fault. He was angry with me. He said that you couldn't stand living with the two of us. And he blamed me. That's not true, is it, mother? - No, that isn't true. - And then the military came. Tried to drive us away with their strange experiments. Father tried to blame that on me too. He thought I was trying to sell the land. He thought I was trying to trick him. - Where is your father now, Andre? - He's being cared for. Father had an accident, mother. I do everything now. - What was that? - Shh! - It's him again. - Maybe it's help. - It's Andre, I know it! - Shh! Maybe it's Simone. Maybe she got loose. (wood creaking) Where's Simone? (eerie music) (wood creaking) - Andre, why do you keep those girls locked up in the barn? Now that I'm here couldn't you let them go? - No, I couldn't let them go. I captured them. They belong to me. You don't know how hard it is. Sometimes I have to stalk them from the tower, then I have to catch them. And then still don't work out at times. Sometimes, they have to be disposed of. - Aren't they missed? Doesn't anyone ever come looking for their animals? - No. No one misses these little animals out in that jungle. The jungle has a very short memory. - You didn't like your breakfast? - Oh no, it was fine. Fine, I guess I'm just not hungry, that's all. - More coffee? - Yeah, thanks. - You really must have a lot on your mind. Around here I'm considered the best cook in the county. - The breakfast was great. It was good. But it's true, I got a lot on my mind. - Alright. - By the way, where's the best place in town to stay? - Well, there's a nice hotel just down the block. Good morning, Frank. How are you this morning? - Fine. - Coffee? - Yeah. Been up all night trying to find a couple of missing motorists. - The usual? - Please. - Coming right up. - Excuse me. These missing motorists, you found them? - No, sir, I'm afraid we didn't. - Are they women? - No, two men camping. They were reported yesterday missing from the campsite about 10 miles from here. - Well, I'm missing some people too. You haven't heard about three young women disappearing a couple of days ago somewhere between here and Las Vegas, have you? - Seems to me we received a report from the county. But I thought at the time patrol dismissed it as an erroneous report. - What do you mean erroneous report? - We get them all the time. People get lost out here for awhile, later they pop up like nothing happened. - [Derek] You mean you guys do nothing about looking for these people? - Yeah, when we can. Why, what's your interest in these girls? - They're my clients, these girls. I booked them in Las Vegas. They're opening at the Las Vegas Lodge. I left them a couple of days ago in Los Angeles and I said, you know, we'll all meet in Vegas and never they never showed up. So I'm going nuts trying to find out what happened to them. - Maybe they stayed in Los Angeles. - No, no, no. This was opening night, they couldn't wait to get there. Let me tell you something, I've been to every town between here and Vegas, and I've checked with highway patrol, no reports of accidents. Nothing. - You say you've checked all towns along the highway? - Yeah. - They obviously took another route. What was your name again? - Derek Moore. - Alright, Mr. Moore, can you describe the womans to me? You know, how they were dressed, make of car, anything that might help? - Well, there was a blonde, and two brunettes. Very pretty girls. And they were driving a brown Ford station wagon, '66. - [Frank] I want to check out a few things. I'll be right back. - [Waitress] Everything's going to be alright, son. Frank Stanford's a darned good man. He'll do everything he can. - [Derek] Well, somebody better do something. (clock ticking) (dramatic music) (Corrine gasps) - Shh. Shh. (dramatic drum music) (Corrine screams) (dramatic music) (Corrine screaming) (door rattling) Listen to me! If you do what I tell you, you won't get hurt, and I'll treat you well. (dramatic music) Get up. The one thing I don't have in my circus is a reptile. So I need one. Put your hands behind you. Behind you. You're going to be my little reptile lady. You're going to be good at it. Because if you're not, you won't be treated well. Now, get on your knees. Get on your knees! Now, lie down! (dramatic music) Look at me! Now crawl. (Corrine screaming) Crawl! Crawl! Come on. (dramatic music) Come on. Come on! Come on. Come on! Come on! Now roll over. Roll over! Now, I want you to meet a little friend of mine. (Corrine screams) You'll get used to him. You're going to learn his ways. His movements. You're going to get inside of him. And he's going to get inside of you. - Please, please. Please, please! (screams) - Here's something. - A credit card receipt. - Seems that three nights ago the girl fitting your description and her car filled up at the Baker's garage. - Did the guy at the station say which they headed for? - No, but there's only a couple of routes they could've taken. Now, let's see. Through here is the main highway leading into Nevada. This is an old secondary road, hasn't been used since the government closed it up some years back. - What's that? - You mean right here? - Yeah. - I don't know, could be anything. Just an old dirt road. Probably would lead to a ranch or something. - Something. That's exactly it, something. The end of the world perhaps. Even worse, the gateway to Hades. - Now, Mr. Alvarez, the sheriff is busy. - Well, he should be. There's someone walking around out there. - Now, Mr. Alvarez are you watching the flying saucers again? - Among other things. I say the testing of the H-Bomb is changing our whole world. You're not going to get me out there, no siree. - Okay, what do we do now? - I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to do a little snooping around. First we'll try the old highway. I'll put in the call to the CHP, the Nevada boys will check their end of the highway. Ms. Bains. - Hmm? - When my two partner shows up send him up the old highway, pronto. - Right away, Frank. - Thank you. - I want to show you something. Now, mother, I don't want you to ever come in here alone. It's very dangerous. This is my lab, my workshop. I spend a great deal of time getting things ready for the show. It's not much I know, but it's convenient. And look, look, look. See, I can watch the animals through here. Now, mother, I've got to go away for a little while, but you'll be safe here. I've got to go check on the animals. - Andre, why don't you let me check them for you? - Oh no, mother, they're too dangerous. They're vicious. They'll turn on you. Breeding is important. Some of them seem untrainable. It'll be my duty as ringmaster to teach them discipline. - Andre, what did you do with Loretta? - She's with the others. - What others? - To soon be part of our sideshow. So many things have happened. I've worked very hard since you've been gone. We got a real circus this time, mother. Not some make believe like when daddy was ringmaster, but a real circus. Oh, mother, I'm so glad you're back. I'm so glad you're back. (Andre sobs) We have so much to talk about. I'll try not to be long. (dramatic music) (Simone sobbing) (engine revs) - Is that the dirt road you meant? - That's the one. - Turn right here. Well, go ahead. - Be around here somewhere. - Yeah. Let's go down the road. (dramatic music) - Is that Simone? My god, is that Simone? - What are they doing in there? (Simone grunts) - Fight him, Simone, fight him. Kill him! - Damn you, Derek, find us! - This must be the gateway to Hades that old guy was talking about, right? Well, what are we gonna do now? - We're gonna go right through. Come on, let's go. (engine revs) (dramatic music) (tinny musical box music) (sobs) (dramatic music) (women shouting) - Simone, please Simone. Help me, Simone. - Game. (women shouting) - Don't forget me. What about me? What about me? (dramatic music) (women shouting) - Go on. It's okay. Go. Go on. (dramatic music) - Thank you, Simone. (dramatic music) - Oh, Simone, it doesn't work. It doesn't work. - [Simone] It's gonna work. - No. Go, please, he could come back any minute. Please. Get out of here! Go. - Try the next one. (dramatic music) (girls gasp) (dramatic music) (engine revs) - Yeah, that's their car alright. They must've had engine trouble. What do you see? - Don't know exactly. Looks like an old barn. Can't quite make it out. - Well, let's check it out. - No, first we'll go the old highway and pick up my deputy, then we'll go check it out. (dramatic music) (door rattling) - You're no different from the others. You're the same kind of deceitful, lying animal just like the rest of them. I can't trust you. - Andre, I'm not an animal. I'm not your mother. My name is Simone. - You think that I believe that? You lied to me like you did before. (door rattles) I heard what you thought of me years ago. You and that man. He said that I was insane and you said he was right. - Andre, what are you doing? - I'm not insane. I've always known what I wanted to do. - [Simone] What are you doing? - Ladies and gentlemen, welcome-- (man moaning) - Lock him up! Come on, lock him up! Lock him up! Come on, hurry! Lock him up! Come on! (man moaning) Come on, hurry, dammit! What are you doing? Come on, hurry! Get the key! (dramatic music) (man moaning) Hurry, get the key! (dramatic music) (Andre groaning) - What have you done? - [Simone] Get me out of here! (man groaning) (dramatic music) - Go back! Go back! (Simone screaming) Go back! Father? Go back! Go back! Father! (father groaning) (Simone screaming) (dramatic music) (father groaning) (duck quacks) (dramatic music) (father groaning) (girls screaming) (father groaning) (girls screaming) (Karene laughing) (girls screaming) (father groaning) (Karene laughing) (girls screaming) (father groaning) (engine revs) (dramatic music) (door slams) - [Derek] Thanks. - Come on. - Good god! (cougar growls) (shotgun blasts) - Come on. God, what happened here? This one's still alive. What happened here? Freddie, get the bolt cutter out of the Jeep. - My house. - Jesus Christ. (Karene singing) (Karene muttering) - Can you tell me what happened? Who done this? - I found this one wandering around. There's two others just like that, dead. - You fire that shot? - Yes, I did. I killed a cougar. - Okay, let's get these people back to Hart.
