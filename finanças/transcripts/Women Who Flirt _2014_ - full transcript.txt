To get your man back The name of our mission? Who we're proud to be... Women Who Flirt According to our test It took the waitress 2 mins and 16 secs To notice the spilled wine What's her name? I'll fire her Mr. Qiu, the performance of your staff Is not the problem here There's a serious imbalance between Your staff and customers A customer spends over 500 RMB on average In China that means a high-end client At a similar restaurant abroad The customer/staff ratio would be 1.57 So basically You're understaffed That affects the quality of your service But last time I checked There's enough staff Right, Mr. Qiu That's true We checked with the restaurant There're two shifts in a day 7 to 8 people work on each shift But at least three of them Are related to the manager His cousin His uncle-in-law His ex-wife's nephew High school friends of his ex-wife's nephew Most of the time These people go AWOL How's that possible? Many business owners find it hard to believe But these things happen That's why we're here If I let you inspect all my restaurants I'd get a discount, right? Yes, I'll give you a special offer Marco! Yes? Where are you going? Hailey left her keys at home. I'm going back Are you kidding? Michael might wanna talk You can handle it, you silly goose Tell him I'm on a site visit Come on! By the way, are you free tonight? Yeah, why? I told Hailey about you. She wanna buy you dinner Sure, see you tonight Well done Once we seal the deal with Qiu You'll need more people on the team I'll put you in charge of Unit C and D You should pick someone from your team too Do you have anyone in mind?

Right, you two should switch seats You like sitting next to me No, I'm good Dinner's ready (Let me take a look at that foxy woman!) You two are still together? That's sweet Well, we're... Working together This is my girlfriend Hi, Wang Wow This looks delicious You're cute, and you cook so well No wonder hubby used to come here I thought you hated taking pictures of your food People change You of all people should know that You're someone's hubby now, aren't you? When did that happen? Last time I checked, you're still a virgin Ha ha Not funny You can tell she's a scheming vixen She's got a nice rack though Damn, this is bad They lavish you with fake compliments Angie, dear, I love what you're wearing I studied fashion design in France And I had a thing for this kinda... Theatrical outfit But I always knew I couldn't pull it off It makes me look like a clown I prefer something simpler nothing flashy You know? She looks like Lady Gaga tonight They act all innocent They're really good at it They make a man feel like a hero I wish I could be more independent Like you, Angie Taking care of myself But I just can't Thank God my hubby was with me last time Without him I'd have lost my passport Sweetie, did you tell dear Angie About the blackout at my place? Oh right The other day... Stop Stop! Stop! Stop! It's so embarrassing Fine, go ahead I guess... Angie's part of our family now Exactly! I think it's kinda cute, too Alright The other night she called me crying The power went out at her place. She got scared So I took a cab and rushed over Guess what? Stop, really Please stop Don't tell her It wasn't... It wasn't a blackout She just forgot to pay the electric bill I hate you Angie, you wouldn't believe it The whole place fell into darkness But... That's also the night we got together I hate you And worst of all, they can make a man Do whatever they want Hubby Feed me Be careful. It's hot Here Is it good? I love it when you feed me This is their signature dish, rabbit stir fry We used to order this all the time What's wrong? Is it too spicy? Drink some water Here you go What's wrong? Why are you crying? How could you? Bunnies are cute You're so cruel I used to have a pet rabbit I was born in the year of the rabbit Okay Don't cry (What should I do?) Don't cry, my dear We won't eat it anymore That's so cruel The tears are ruining your makeup Don't cry, my darling Please don't cry I'll stop eating it And so will you Yuck, I hate rabbit meat Don't cry, honey She's still eating! Girls don't eat bunnies. That's cruel Now that's unfair She's a dude She pees standing up Let's go. We're not eating it. Let's go home Don't cry That was horrible We'll be home soon It's over Whoa Did someone break in last night? You were right. I should just let go I was so stupid It was a trap And I walked right into it Alright It was pretty bad But that was just one night We still have a chance Hey! What's this? My aunt in Hong Kong sent it to me She said I shouldn't get a dog if I'm single Or I'll end up like that woman in the news (Dead Spinster Eaten by Pets) It's over I'm hopeless Just let me be It's not over Until I say so Get up Angie's been acting weird lately She's not into me, is she? If I were her I'd crush you to death right now When we were in college, we all knew Angie's got a thing for you But you've always treated her like a dude Is it that obvious? But she's really like a bro to me Fine, then Has she ever peed standing next to you? Do you two ever flirt with chicks together? The thing is I think of her as my bro from day one There's nothing ladylike about her I'm a dude, you know I like sweet girls If I were into butch girls I might as well date a guy Stop it Nah These dating apps Are for men What kind of girls would use them? Normal girls I'm telling you Flirting is like being an assassin You start with long range weapons Like a sniper rifle Keep your distance from the target So that your attack wouldn't backfire Now Let's get started With the basics – texting I can text Marco right now Why do I have to flirt with other men? Unless you practice with strangers You'll never know what your weaknesses are Not to mention... Most men using these apps are otaku They're pretty easy to deal with Here, I did the installation Take a picture first Delete it Why? You think your double chin is sexy? It's just a selfie Watch And learn High angle, chin down Look up a little Try to look innocent That's the standard pose Learn it well! This is really lame But guys love it So learn it well There're three things you should remember Angle, angle and angle Hurry up High angle A bit higher Higher still Chin down Look up a little Chin down Act innocent Make a pitiful face like an orphan Now snap Let's see Always retouch your photos Give her a hand See if there's any guy around worth sleeping Or chatting with Here you go. Hit it He's hot! Wow People are actually responding (You've added Wolf as a friend. Start chatting) Are they jobless or something? What should I say? Whatever you want This guy's cute Hi My name's Angie Wait, are you having a job interview? How do you expect him to reply? Always start with a question Ask him, "What are you doing?" What are you doing? What are you doing? (I'm wondering who's missing me now) (Should I down Louis XIII or Kinmen Liquor?) (Yeah I'm doing it. Wanna join?) Wait. Hold on Remember, don't flirt like a loyal dog You know what cats do? They tease you And ignore you when you warm up to them In a nutshell Be passive aggressive So should I reply him or not? Think about what you wanna say And reply him tonight (I dunno, but you sound like you miss me) (Louis XIII's been dead for ages) (Yeah I'm doing it. Wanna join?) (Jerk) (Who? I'll beat him for you) (Then slap yourself 3 times) (I'm not a jerk. I'm nice) You're good at drawing Why haven't you drawn me anything before? Why haven't you drawn for me? That's amazing! You're so awesome! Angie drew them When we were in college Whenever she got bored She'd draw on my notebook I'm sure there was something between you two Of course not, she's a dude Then why do you still have this Next to your bed? Cause there's nothing between us Absolutely nothing I don't have to hide it from you Hey, don't be upset What's wrong? I just don't like it Alright, don't be mad Don't be mad, please Let me show you something What? Put your hand inside Quick What is it? A bit lower Lower Lower Lower still You feel something hard? Grab it and pull it out What's this? You told me you wanna cycle all the way Around Taiwan with your friends My leave application got rejected But I got you a ticket Have fun with your friends You're the best (What are you doing?) Do you wanna Get your hands On something else? (I'm with Hailey) I still remember the look on Angie's face... When she draws. It's adorable I've asked myself before Whether I should try to date her But somehow we're like parallel lines No matter how close we are, we never meet Enough texting Time to do some training on the ground Go! Angie Quick, say something I'm Mike Keep your head up. Your double chin's showing Just say something Quick Expats are great I love them Same here I don't really care As long as he's got a big nose Hey What should I say to him? The key to flirting is Just pretend you like whatever the guy's saying Whatever he says, just do this Oh, really? Tell me, please I hate you I have no idea It works every time Go ahead Hey Do you know how to play? I have no idea No problem. I'll teach you But today is your first lesson That's okay, I can teach you anyway Your hand... Feels really cold Oops Sorry I forgot to tell you my secret identity I'm Mr. Freeze These hands make great sushi Really? I love sushi When can I get a taste of your sushi? I'm afraid There won't be a chance The sushi business is shrinking The market is too small I did some research And I thought I'd be better off working as a makeup artist I'm straight though Super straight. No worries Place your left hand over your right hand The trick is To thrust your hip Good, nice. Now thrust it That's my cell Really? Yes, it's just my cell Now, pay attention Watch your hands. Focus on the ball Look down And thrust your hip Good, very good Let me do it on my own You don't have to help me Alright. Go ahead So... You must know a lot of pretty girls Not really Company policy forbids us from dating clients I don't believe you If they like your work They would love to see you again If they come and see me again Then I'm in trouble What do you think of my makeup today? Your makeup? It's nice You look better than my clients You're kidding No It's obvious You look healthy My clients They all look pale I met a client this morning She got her face caved in I had no idea what she was thinking She could've picked a better place to land When she jumped off that building Why on earth Would she land on a concrete slab? What was I supposed to do with her face? You put makeup on dead people? You shouldn't put it like that I'm a "Makeup Consultant" for the deceased Let me tell you a secret Eh? Tell me, please Have you heard of Rocket poop? What? Really? I was driving one night Suddenly my stomach started to hurt I reached an intersection. There was nobody around I pulled over, came out of the car And pooped on the spot It felt amazing You know what happened next? I have no idea Pooping in a toilet is one thing But when you poop on the ground When you push really hard The poop that comes out... It would push you upward Once I was done, I got back to the car I turned and looked Gosh, my poop was just standing there Like a monument or something Right at the intersection. It was L-shaped I hate you! Listen If we get together you have to promise me No matter how much we fight You'll never jump off a building But if you really wanna, let's say... Jump off a building Make sure you land on grass It's much softer I hate you! Angie... What did I do wrong? It's the way you say I hate you But I learned it from you Where did I go wrong? When you flirt You gotta sugarcoat Even when you're insulting the guy I hate you Stop it Go away If you look him in the eye and say I hate you! Then you're screwed But my mom used to say we should always Look people in the eye when we talk to them I hate you I hate you I hate you I hate you I hate you I hate you Hey you! You're stealing my oranges again Oops, we didn't do it on purpose We didn't know they were yours We had no idea I just wanna get a taste They're so expensive Alright, just don't take them all You're the best! Thank you You gotta be kidding me Where have you been? This is the power of flirting I hate you I hate you Am I doing it right? Hey, I'm getting better at this, right? Yes, much better I hate you I hate you Wow, that's a big one I hate you (IOU Coupon) You have talent in art But you gave that all up for Marco Was it worth it? I wanted to be with him So I got a job in Shanghai If you could choose again Would you stay and work here Or continue with your sculpting? I don't know I really don't know What do you like about him? He's cute, don't you think? He cares about me, and he shows it in funny ways What was that? You're a girl. Cover your mouth when you yawn Stuffing your mouth? That's what you call "caring"? Well then, I know a lot of guys Who care about me You can't go head to head with her You don't have what it takes You'll just fight a losing battle Hi Do you miss silly goose? I miss you every night So much that I'd cry I hate you Alright, I gotta go See you tonight Bye Where were we? I'm fighting a losing battle Oh yes Well, she's out of town now. Grab the chance.

You're here because you owe me Isn't he a jerk? Well Think about it He's asking you to be discreet If he doesn't have feelings for you He wouldn't do that Be more aggressive How? That'd be embarrassing We're waging war, girl. Can't play it safe There will be blood Trust me Get out of your comfort zone Men...

So he put it in the refrigerator After a few weeks He took it out For some reason The can just kept on swelling He didn't know what to do He didn't know how to get rid of it So he just... Kept holding it in his hands And finally the can just... Exploded! He got hit in the eye My tummy hurts so much. That's hilarious What's so funny about it? Maybe I'm a simple person I love to laugh Do you think it's funny? Eh? It's pretty funny Right? Yeah! He left it there for weeks...

Angie, you're wasting your time No matter what you do Hubby will never fall for you Just give up Why are you so sure? Every boyfirend I've had Is stuck to me like glue I've seen women much younger and sexier than you They flirt much better too None of them managed to take me down You actually had the guts to come all the way here Look at yourself, for Christ's sake Don't be so sure When he kissed me in bed the other night It didn't seem like you were on his mind at all You think a one-night-stand would Turn the tides? You think I'd care? Men are all scumbags I don't give a damn To me... He's just a boy toy You're pretty. You know how to flirt If you're not really into him Why are you messing with him? To be honest I was just teasing him on the bus that day But then he couldn't stop talking about you I got really pissed off So I arranged a dinner To see who the hell you are That night he split your chopsticks for you Right in front of me I hate it when he's so nice to you Even when I'm just right next to him I decided right away to fight this battle Are you out of your mind? Love's not a competition That's what the losers say And I'm... not a loser You know what happened the other day? All I did was whine a little Then he got rid of that notebook With all your Ju Ming sketches Hubby! Hubby! What happened? Why are you crying? What's wrong? Don't cry, babe Don't cry Maybe I did something wrong And Angie got mad You lying vixen! Hey! Can you just stop picking on this little girl For my sake? Marco Gong I'm gonna ask you this only once Are you coming with me? Stop it Where do you want me to go? Where are you going? Hey! Where are you going? Don't cry Where are we going? Follow my direction Okay Right Left Right Left Juming Museum Ju Ming is famous for his chiseling It's sharp and quick It's effortless When I learned sculpting as a kid I always admired his quick, forceful strokes Because I hesitate too much when I work But not this time I jumped in with no thought But the chisel cut me up Until I couldn't recognize myself anymore But I'm made of flesh, not stone Does he know the pain He's caused me? You don't think she had an accident? I can't reach her She can take care of herself Don't worry She's never missed my call Maybe something happened to her I gotta go back to Taipei Don't go! Hubby! You came here to see me Not her Besides... She was bullying me How come you're on her side? What happened exactly? Why would she yell at you all of a sudden? I have no idea Maybe she's jealous? What did you say to her? Nothing I was just telling her No matter how close you two used to be You're my guy now So... I wouldn't let her fawn over you Don't even think about it It's nothing like that You're thinking too much I don't believe you When I told her you threw away That notebook with all her sketches Because of me I could tell from her face She's really into you What? Why did you have to tell her that? See! Why are you all riled up? I hate you! Make your choice now It's me or her Answer me Answer me! I used to wonder when I read the tabloids Why girls like Paris Hilton Never really have a decent love life? They flirt too much After a while All the sweet talk gets really annoying I'm going back to Taipei Are you looking for someone? Sorry Did Angie Zhang switch to another room? I'm her friend Miss Zhang checked out already Thank you Michael I haven't seen Angie for two days Is she on leave? You haven't heard? She resigned Where did she go? I was about to ask you the same thing Is she working for Qiu now? Why did she quit right after the trip? I don't know Anyway, Angie told me To let you lead the team Good luck. I'm counting on you Marco Gong! Marco Gong! Not again! You jerk! Marco Gong! Sorry, Excuse me Hey! Your bike got stolen again? Yes Why would he leave me a wheel? That's pretty kind of him Every time I lost my bike Angie would always take me home But this time I think I've lost her Hey I thought... You were bringing your girlfriend We broke up What? We broke up! Already? Where's Angie? The other day She dropped by and gave me a birthday gift She said she'd come back When was that? Two days ago What did she give you? What did you say? What did she give you? She gave me this You know what, over the years I've helped many people unlock their doors But there's one door That I can't open, no matter how hard I try The door to your heart Son Deep down you know she likes you But you never take her seriously Angie Is like a fool For sticking around What did I do wrong? I had no idea I only found out recently You think she's a dude and you joke about it But think about it That's exactly why You like her Well... I'm not comfortable with her getting flirty I like our little fights though Your mom passed away too soon And I was busy working all the time We made you feel insecure You were afraid she'd reject your love So you shut her out, right? She's been hiding from me. What can I do? Do you know Why kids like playing hide-and-seek? Because they want to be found I fear the stillness in the air I'm really grateful Thank you for all the help you've given me I fear the memories we share They haunt me and leave me in despair So you're going to Hangzhou? Yes I wanna go to grad school I gave up too much for that jerk I haven't sculpted anything for years Okay Look at this Bottoms up Bon voyage Where are you? Are you feeling blue? All of a sudden I miss you I'm having adéjà vu Tears blurring my view What are you doing here? Listen, I'm kinda an insecure guy My mom died when I was a kid We were not a wealthy family When I meet a girl I like, I get shy Then I met you. The timing was perfect But I was too scared and stupid to ask you out I was selfish. I thought I was protecting you But I was protecting myself Forget it And uh... You know I realized You're like the tomato And I'm the prune Although we are in the same basket All we are is close I never thought we would go well together Until I entered you by accident And realized we're a perfect match It's... Just a figure of speech Perfect match? Bullshit You listened to that woman and threw everything away I didn't! You know what? I've kept Everything you gave me Even the flying guillotine You told me to throw away I kept it but I didn't tell you I used it to decorate my phone What's the point? You're seeing someone now I broke up with Hailey I told her I'm not interested in girls I always thought I should find myself A sweet girlfriend But after the trip I came to terms with myself My desires I'm... Gay You Are my true love Wait a second Why would that turn you into a gay man? That's not the point The thing is I love you Angie You don't have to change yourself for me You're a dude, and that's fine I'm the one Who has to do a little adjustment Now I know... What kinda person I am And I know I need someone like you I love you just the way you are I'm sorry Go get him! Where are you going? I don't expect you to forgive me I'm gonna spend the rest of my life Thinking about the mistakes I made You wish I still have a lot of IOU coupons with me I'll use them all. You're not going anywhere I know better now There's no use sweet talking to you I'll let you do all the sweet talking So Can silly goose forgive pighead? Hang on What if you run into another girl With a nice rack And she's really good at flirting? What would you do? Absolutely nothing I told you. I'm gay Girls... I'm fed up with them I just wanna spend time With my hot boyfriend I hate you Let's go! I wanna eat some bunnies Alright! Let's bite their heads off! Let's go! Go!
