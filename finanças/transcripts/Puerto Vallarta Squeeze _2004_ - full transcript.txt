What do you have out here that you don't have inside? The moon... and a few billion stars. Hmm. I don't think I can compete with that... but I can try. Go back to bed. I'll be in soon. Mivida... don't worry. That's my job when I'm not writing. Why? The check might be here tomorrow... and you will have wasted tonight. The sun will rise... and bring all good things with it. Hmm? Mm-hmm? So there's one already. - Ha ha ha! - Come on. Come on, honey. Let's dance, honey. No, honey! Mihelado! Pick your passion-- me or the ice cream. Oh! No. No, no! No! Come on. Let's go get a drink. No, it's too early. Come on, honey. You already had your treat. No. Hey, Jack. How's it going, buddy? - Good. - Good man. - Two, Bill. - One. OK. - The good stuff? - Uh, no, not today. No. Long time between royalty checks, huh? Well, you know what they say-- it's a feast or famine business. Yeah. More like famine-famine lately. Ah, don't worry. Your credit's good... as long as you got Luz with you. Heh. Cómo estás, papita. Fine, thank you. And yourself? Oh, real good right now. Real good. How's the wife, Bill? Too smart to walk into a dive like this... with a bunch of losers. I’m sure she gets enough of that at home. Keep the change, Bill. Come on. What'd you do, hock your car? Huh? Hey, it'll take more than this to buy you some pride big-time. - What is your problem? - Danny, no. You pathetic lackey! Oh, yeah, yeah. You just keep talkin' to the mirror, man. You know, one more month without a check, and you are me. Come on, let's go. Hey, we got an apron in the back with your name on it... just waitin' for you, Danny boy! Do you believe that? What a stupid son of a bitch. No! You're the stupid son of a bitch... for arguing with a stupid son of a bitch! Hey, all I wanted was a drink. You had a hundred bars to choose from! You went up there to punish yourself-- and me, too, maybe. I don't need this. What's the matter? Did you lose something? Get-- Aah! Luz! Luz! What happened? Oh, my God! Luz, are you OK? Oh, my God. You're--blood! Are you all right? Honey...we've got to get out of here. It's all right now. Honey? It's all right. It's all right. Sweetheart... His face, Danny. I thought he was... grabbing at me. I-- So I... turned to him, you know? Angry. And the last face... he saw before he left the world... was angry. Luz, he was probably already gone, honey. No. Sweetie. Luz. Luz... maybe you'd like to go rest before we go home. Let's go inside. I pray for his soul. It's all right. Oh. Oh. - You OK? - Yeah. Come on. E-e-excuse me. Look...I don’t want to bother you guys... but maybe you can help me out. What is it? I’m looking for a ride to the border. Why don’t you just fly? Well, I'm a little squeamish about flying. Mexican roads aren't any safer. How'd you get here? Uh, a yacht, but I wanted to spend a little time... and my friends had to get back. Why the rush now? I just found out I have a meeting in Dallas. Oh, well...bummer. Tell me about it. You know anybody with a car? I’ll pay good money. I might. How much? I don't know. Uh... 2, 3,000? - Oh, I have a c-- - Shh. Uh, I have a car, but I'm pretty busy right now. Time is precious. How about 4,000? Free some up. I might be able to put some work aside, yeah. Honey, no. There are asaltantes on the roads. Bandits. Uh... there is that danger. 15 up north, east in the mountains. OK, how about I throw in another grand--hazard pay? Honey, how much is your life worth? 5,000, plus expenses? 2,500 in advance? Yeah, deal... if we leave tonight. Well...deal. We live just a few blocks away. She looks like she's clocked more miles... than a midtown hooker. Think she'll make it? Sure, she will. But just in case... I have some new plugs and a spare fan belt in back. What about a spare transmission? Uhh. Appearances can be deceiving. Yeah, I heard that once. How long before we leave? As soon as I throw some things together. See? She still puts out. Danny, mivida. Huh? Could I talk to you for a minute? Sure, honey. "Mivida" isn't a good sign. Coming, honey! You are not driving that man to the border. For $5,000, I'll carry him. You don't know anything about him! You don't even like him. Let’s just say he bought my affection. If you go with him... I won't be here when you get back. If I don't go with him, we'll be thrown out of here... and you'll leave me anyway. Luz, I got to do something. So write. You're a writer, not a chauffeur. OK. I'll write a book tonight. I’ll get it published tomorrow. We should have a royalty check by next week. Life is not like one of your telenovelas, Luz. Be practical. You think it's practical... to drive a complete stranger to the border... in the middle of the night? This is an opportunity for us, Luz. It's a blessing, honey. No. It's some terrible test. - Oh... - On a day of bad omens. I don't have time for ignorant village hocus-pocus. OK? Besides, it'll be an adventure... give me something to write about. Oh, spare me the bullshit, OK? You've got a typewriter! That's all you need to write! Oh, ha ha. Whew! How much of that did you hear? I missed the part about how you don't even like me. Ha ha! She’s just a little upset. Apparently, you'll be missed. But not for long. - You are not going with us. - Watch me. Luz, get back in the house. My father talked to my mother that way... but he was an ignorant villager. -It's OK with me if she comes. -It's not OK with me. Ah, come on. She handles food and translation. You drive, I ride shotgun, eyes peeled for bandidos. Exactly. It's too dangerous. No. It will be an event to remember. - Luz, I'm serious. - No! It's getting late, guys. The siren's still going. Yeah. We don't usually have two people slaughtered... on the main drag in broad daylight. Two white people. Oh, yeah. That, too. Think it'll be hard getting out of town? Well, there may be a roadblock, checking people's papers. Can we avoid that? Way ahead of you. Aiming for a back street. Oh. Your up-front money, plus, uh... 100 for supplies. Hide that, honeybunch. Now, there's nothing in that bag... that I don’t want in my car, is there? Well... there is this. Is it OK to take these out of the country? Yeah. McGrane. When? Do you have a positive I.D. on the navy brass? Reese? Ohh, man. That sick bastard. He really did it. Ohh. I’ll be there. Leave everything. I'll watch it. I said, I'll watch it. Yeah, I heard you. Thanks. Honey, it’s just a few days. Let's get through it, OK? - ¿Qué pasa, Victor? - ¿Wué pasa, Danny? They've been going all night. What is it? An assassination. That's what I heard. Really? Isn’t that right, Sargento Reyes? That's what I was told. Two Americans. One navy officer... and a turista that got in the way. Two Americans, eh? You better watch out. Right. Any suspects? We are looking for anyone suspicious-- like you, maybe. Are you suspicious? No. Listen, Victor, if I arrest them... I'll get a promotion. And you'll get a reward. Buenas noches. Buenas noches. Cabrón. You going somewhere? No, just hungry. Where did you say we’re headed? Which border town, I mean? I haven't decided yet. Got a map? Side of the door. So, um... what kind of business do you have in Dallas? Ah, a little freelance work. I wasn't, uh, asking for your resume. You know... just making conversation. Everybody hold on! Sorry about that. You OK, honey? I forgot where I was for a minute. Now I remember. The roads can get a little bumpy. Ah, I'm used to it. You travel a lot in your line of work? Yeah, enough. What brought you to Puerto Vallarta? - Running from the cops? - No. - I.R.S.? - No. Ex-wife. Ha ha ha! No, nothing that specific. I’m a writer, so I'm running from life in general. Ha ha ha ha! Danny has written five books. The last one-- Chicago Crime Syndicate-- won the National Book Club Award. Thank you, honey. She's my press agent. Yeah. That's impressive. On paper, maybe. But it's... it doesn't always pay the rent. Chicago Crime Syndicate. Mm-hmm. Ha ha! You meet any mobsters? Yeah. Several. Wow. Sounds dangerous. Well, it can be. You know, in about an hour, I'm gonna need to know... which border town you want me to head for. I haven't decided yet. I’m thinking...Sonoita. Sonoita? Where's that? Let's see, uh... Route 15 to Santa Ana... then west, Route 2. It goes right there. South of Arizona. That's gonna leave you a long ways from Dallas. Well, you got your money, right? - Yeah, but, uh-- - Thanks. I appreciate your concern. Just when everything was going so nicely, right? Sir. Yep. You might want to keep your eyes open on this one. I beg your pardon, sir? Did you read the dossier on the target? Clayton Price, 5'11"... gray-brown hair, brown eyes. Slender build. OK. He just killed you... shot you dead because you're so stupid. What have we taught you? You're hunting a man... one more intelligent than you... with all your training and more experience. He's not the third duck in the second row... at the shooting gallery. In fact, he thinks you are. Sir, I was just-- Tell me what he's really like... what his guts smell like. That's the only way you're gonna nail him. I know he was in the Special Ops in Vietnam, sir. Did 2 tours. 82 confirmed hits, over 200 probables. He was the Babe Ruth of wetwork. What else? He started working for Covert Operations. They used him successfully until five years ago... when he began to question instructions. Right. He objected to a hit in Asia on political grounds. What else? He ended up turning rogue... killing navy brass in Puerto Vallarta... and briefing wouldn't tell me why... or who he was working for, sir. Right. That's irrelevant to you. Yes, sir. He's a man with dangerous talents... and an unstable mind, and he's roaming free. Let intelligence handle the subtleties. Your job is to kill him. Yes, sir. Here. Do some more homework. What you learn might save your life. That's all I'm trying to do, son. Jeez! Look out! - Danny! - Oh, my God! Hold on to something, Luz! Oh, man! I can't control it! Danny! Do something! Danny! No! Let go of the wheel! I'm steering this thing! I thought gravity was! Man, now, that's a detour. You crazy bastard. You could've killed us. No, plowing into a wall of cows would've killed us. Wall of cows? Yeah, exactly. I swerved just in time. - Yeah, off a cliff. - I told you, the roads are bad! Bad? Not as bad as your driving! Both of you, shut up! And try to figure out where in carajo we are! Guess we're on the road to San Blas. Looks like it. I’m Colonel Benjamin Rivera... military intelligence, Mexico city. Walter McGrane. This is Neil Weatherford. Welcome to Puerto Vallarta. This will be your vehicle. You're my assigned liaison? Yes, sir. My men and I were briefed... when we arrived last night... but, of course, I would appreciate... any further information you could provide us. All information will be distributed by headquarters... on an as-needed basis. We need to know more about this man. No, we need to know. You just need to help us. Now, if you don't mind, I want to see where it happened. How long you want to stay? I don't know. A couple hours. Long enough to clean up, get some shuteye, food. - OK with you? - Sure. What about you, Luz? Enough time to rest? Yes, thank you. You might want to have your tourist card ready... just in case. I don't have one. Didn’t your boat go through immigration? Yeah, but I was below deck... and I didn’t figure I'd need one for just two or three days. Well, how the hell do you expect to get across the border? Especially in some little fleabag town like Sonata... or whatever you call it. I don't know. If the border official is even awake... I'll just bribe him. You can't buy everyone in Mexico, you know. It's working so far. Ha ha! Well, what if the cop stops you? Jesus. One night together... and you're already my goddamn wife. Let me worry about it, will you? All right, you wait here. Luz and I will check in... and I'll tell them that my idiot brother is waiting in the car. You must be a very patient woman, Luz. That's the only kind God makes. Luz? Honey? Shouldn’t you be sleeping? I slept in the car... between arguments. Want to swim? No. I didn't bring my traje de baño. Me, either. What are you avoiding looking at? My underwear... or my scars? Nothing. Car accident? War accident. But it's OK. They're not painful... just ugly. They are not so ugly. Thanks. Danny still sleeping? Up here. Well, how about hitting the road? How about some food first? How about some pants... for both of you? 73. 73 feet. Expert work. Small caliber handgun... target approximately 25 yards away... all without being able to take a sight. The best and the brightest. What the hell was Price thinking? We have an I.D. The owner of a bodega on the edge of town... the night of the killings. Yeah, and? The suspect was with another American, a local resident. Send out a description of the American... along with the photo we supply-- every cop, all military, every border station. Yes, sir. I’ve already done that. That's great. Then you can read my mind. The next time, you don't give an order... until you hear it from my lips. Do you understand? And I don’t want any engagement. ls that clear? None. If they see him, they call you. You tell me. Got it? You have instructed us not to engage. We will not engage. Emphasize it. This is our operation. I want it handled our way. I don’t want some local boy getting macho... and deciding to play the hero. Believe me, it'll be the last decision he makes-- and the bloodiest. ¡Vámonos! Luz, honey... I want you to be careful around this guy. We don't know anything about him. You're the one who decided to drive him across the country. I know, but I'm just saying don't get too friendly. Did you see those scars? People don't have scars like that. He was in the war. What'd they do, blow him up and sew him back together again? - Danny. - Don't get all gooey about it... and don't believe everything you hear. He's not a lost puppy. Keep your distance. - Ready to roll? - Yeah, good to go. OK, let's do it. - OK? - OK. This is what they don't tell you about... in the travel brochures. Yeah, that's the trick. Hide the poor folk in the jungle. Get your hands on the tourist dollar. Yep, exactly... but I sure don't blame these poor bastards. I was one of these poor bastards. This is like the village I grew up in. See that little girl? She's me, twenty years ago. Why'd you leave, Luz? When I was fifteen, I could've stayed... and become a farmer's wife like my mother... and become an old woman at thirty... or go to work in one of the turista cities. I chose the city. Is your family still there? They're all gone... like dust. My two brothers died of cholera... my father died of hard work... and my mother died of broken dreams. I was the lucky one, I guess. Luz worked as a maid at one of the hotels in Puerto Vallarta... then as a waitress at Chulo's. That's where I met her. - Sad beginnings, happy endings. - That's right. And what about you? Where are your people from? Brooklyn, New York. But they left me. My dad ran away when he was 35. My mom fell in love with the bottle... and sent me packing to my grandparents in Oregon... where I grew up. I’m sorry. Eh, fuck 'em if they can’t take a kid. If we stay on 15... it's pretty much straight up all the way. Danny... do you think we could go to Rosario? It's not too far from here. Why do you want to go there for? I want to pay respects to my parents... visit their graves. I’m sorry, honey. That takes us out of our way to see dead people. Maybe we could pay our respects on the trip back. We won't stop, I know. No, if we take this little road out of Escanaba... head west towards the sea, we go right by Rosario. Well, that’s just an inch on the map... but that’s about an hour by car. I’ll give you another 500 bucks. I--I don’t want any more of your money. I thought you were in a hurry. I’m trying to save you some time. I’m willing to give it up. I like seeing these back roads, little villages. I hope so, because you might be spending... a week or two in one of them if my car breaks down. I’ll take that chance. Thank you. Hey, Poncho, dos mas tequilas... ydos mas cervezas, ahora. Just ignore them. Ignore them. Hey, lookit. Borrachopendejo. Hey, what are you looking at? I was just looking for your balls, man. Thought maybe you left them up in there. Sit down and shut up, Danny. - No. - Stop. Maybe you should listen to your pussy friend, Danny. - Yeah, Danny boy. - Ha ha ha ha! Come on, stop. Danny... sit down. Idiot. Hey, you got a match? - Yeah, I do. - Holy shit. Pussy's got a match. - What are you doing? - Just being helpful. Hey, man, how do you suppose the pussy and old Danny boy... ended up with a piece of first class puta like her, huh? ¡Borracho estúpido! I guess money talks. Danny, take Luz to the car. Hey, toss that over here. Oh, I can do better than that. Here you go. Thanks. Let me take a look at that. Hang on, hang on. You need a light? No, I don't need a light. - Sure you do. - My drink! You should keep more oil in your crank case... and less on your shirt. It's a real fire hazard. Hey! Put it out! Put it out! I guess America wiped its ass today, and you two fell out. Oh, you fucked up now. Get her in the car. Start the engine. No, we have to help him. Come on. He doesn't need our help. That's right. Come on. Now, what the hell was that all about? Decline of the gene pool. You didn't have to set the guy on fire. No. I could've let him cut your balls off... rape your girlfriend. It never would’ve gone to that. You spend too much time with your typewriter, Danny. In the real world, some people aren't just fake dangerous. They're real dangerous. Oh, yeah, right. This from the guy... who has no tourist card, remember? Hey, you know what? Around here, the judiciales... the federal police, are a lot more dangerous... than a couple of biker trash. Thank you, Luz. Stop. - What? - Stop. What is it? It's an ocelot. What's it doing in the cage? Oh, it's to sell to a zoo... or some rich tourist needs to keep her neck warm. I don't know. Ask him how much he wants for it. We can't put that thing in my car. Yeah, I know. What are you asking the price for? To let it go. He says $3,000. He says they are very rare. 3,000. I don't have that much left. Look at it. He should kill the damn thing or let it go. Ask him how he'd like to live trapped in a little cage. He says he does. He used his real name. He's either a hostage... or the dumbest accomplice in the world. He says they paid in cash for two rooms. If they used two separate rooms... then it's probably not a hostage situation, right, sir? Right. Now stop talking before you ruin West Point's reputation. Show me. He said the man and the woman stayed in this room... and the suspect in the other. What are we hoping to find, sir, may I ask? Nothing. He's too smart to leave anything behind. I just wanted to stand in his space for a moment... breathe the air he breathed. Maybe sniff out a clue in the ether. You believe in metaphysics, Weatherford? No, sir. Not really. Me, neither. He says the suspect went for-- Stop with the Dick Tracy. His name is Price. Price... took a swim in the pool. Hmm. Sure. Why not? There's a dragnet over half of Mexico... and he's having a fucking pool party. We have the make and the model of the car, señor. It’s just a matter of time. But how much, Rivera? It's not just that I'm getting older in this steam bath... or that Price might whack a few dozen people before we find him-- it's also embarrassing. I mean, where are all the bright lights... of the Mexican police and military... while he's taking his road trip? Aren’t you just a little embarrassed? We haven’t found him yet, señor, it's true... but you created him. Who should be more embarrassed? She said she wants to be alone. Yeah. I’ve said that, too. I should've come back to see her more... before she died. I lost so many minutes with her. I know. You wish you could go back. Listen a little harder... look a little more closely at their eyes... and speak a few more kind words. Many more. If--if you could have... what would you have said to her? I would've... thanked her... for fighting... to give me more than she had. She argued with my father... to get me to school... and he beat her for her pride. She let him beat her... but she won. Gracias, mama. And look at you-- so smart, so beautiful. She would've been proud. No. I wasn’t worth being beaten for. I’m not a good girl. - You OK, honey? - Yes. I've just been looking at the map. You ready to head back to 15 now or what? Ah, we're so near the coast. Let's stay on this road for a while. Your dime. He got all ape shit. He torched my bro, you know? Poor guys. On their way to Club Med, minding their own business... and this had to happen to them. Price must be losing it if he let these two live. Look how perfect. It's timeless. Eternal. Aah! God! Hey, I hate to interrupt your Zen moment... but the car's not happy with this heat. I don't know if we’re going to make it. Sure, she will. She just needs some encouragement. You know, you can rub her ass with Icy Hot... but I don’t think it's going to help. You may have to find yourself another ride. Did you hear what I said? Yeah. Why don’t you use some of those spare parts... you were bragging about? Hey, I got spare parts, but I'm not the Pep Boys. Judiciales. - What'd he say? - He wants your tourist cards. Tell him that our papers are in the car... and Mr. Fisher had his stolen. -I speak English. - OK, great. Uh...you guys have badges, right? Badges? Badges? - You want to see our badges? - Please. See? I showed you mine, but you can't show me yours. Well, we all had tourist cards-- Shut up. You talk too much. - OK. - Get in the car. Come on, all of you. Hey! Come on, get in the car. Danny, I don’t want to go with them. Hey! Cállate. Let's not argue with them. ¡Cállate! Sube alcoche. ¡Suelta me! Luz, move! Don't get hysterical on me now. Jesus. They're all dead! Them or us. People die every day. Yeah, when you're around. He saved us, Danny! If we’d never met him, we wouldn't have had to be saved! Hey, how about some help over here? No, I’ve had enough! I'm not moving your corpses for you! You gonna stay here with your thumb up your ass... waiting to get arrested for murder? You killed them, we didn't! Tell that to a Mexican judge! Luz, don't! He is right! We have no choice! Sorry it went down like this. Yeah, sorry I killed three guys. I’m sorry I made you accomplices to murder. I’m sorry I ruined your lives! Danny! This is where we are-- right here, right now. Now accept it and make a choice. What, Mexican justice or going with you? No. I'm not leaving you here to talk to anybody. Going with me or my justice. Now come on over here and grab this guy's feet. Come on. Luz, open the trunk. Luz... Luz, open the trunk. Danny, grab his feet. Other one in the back. We'll find a deserted spot up the road to ditch them. Here, you drive this car. I'll take the Jeep. I’ll take the Jeep. Yeah, right. Come on, Luz. Hey, are we your hostages? No. You're my sidekicks. Thanks for helping me back there. You were very brave. Ohh! God! Shit! No. What is he doing? Oh, my God! Oh, God! Oh, no! No! Hang on. Please, please, please, don't hurt him! Please! Where the hell do you think you’re going? I don't know. You want to get stopped for speeding... with three corpses in the car? No. I'm sorry. Honey-- Shh. Not a problem. I wasn't running away. I just-- I--I was trying to get away from... You're going to kill us, aren’t you? Not if I don't have to. Put this thing in gear. Turn off at the next side road. Luz. You drive, OK? OK. And no cute stuff. I’m not one of those dumb ass gangsters you wrote about. Look... just get me to the border... and you'll get your life back. OK. We'll take the Durango turnoff... and head east into the mountains. You killed those men in Puerto Vallarta, didn’t you? - You know I did. - What do you mean? You saw me. You were looking right at me. - No, I wasn't. - You were looking right at me. Danny, is that true? No. I mean, I wasn't sure. I saw his hand under his vest and-- You weren't sure? You agreed to drive him, and you weren't sure? You thought maybe he killed two people, maybe he didn't? I thought at first, if it was him... I could handle it, but I didn't know, OK? Well, what about me? You let me come with you. Did you think I could handle it, too? You insisted on coming, remember? You just had to come. I didn't know everything, Danny. - Well, neither did I! - You knew more than I did... and you didn’t tell me. It's your fault we're here. Me? What about him? Boy, those sins of omission will get you every time. And you--I was standing right next to that man. You could've killed me! No, I couldn't. I don't miss. So proud to be a killer of men... to steal a human life. There is a dark spot on your soul... for every man you have killed. Then it must be pitch black by now. Yes, it must. God weeps for you. What can we expect at the road? Nothing for a while. Then Concordia-- that's an inspection station... and they got guns. We better get cleaned up. Luz...not too far. I won't try to swim across the border. May I have a little privacy? No. I want you both where I can see you. Luz, what are you doing? What? He wants to see me. Make sure I'm not carrying a bomb or a knife or a gun. When you're a killer, you think everyone is a killer. When you're done, let's go. Shit. A Galil. What's that mean? It means don't do anything stupid. The kid probably doesn't know how to use that thing. He could hose us all down in a second if he freaks out. Thanks for helping me appear nonchalant. And don’t try acting out that little drama... you're playing around in your head... 'cause I'll be rewriting the ending, you understand? Understand? Yes. Luz? I’m just a dumb Mexican chick in the back seat. Heh. All right. Smile, people. We’re just one big happy family. ¿Habla español? Muypoco. Luz? The engine. The rocks on the beach were slippery, weren’t they? Oh, Si, Si. Pronto. Yes. You should be more careful. Mexico can be very dangerous... if you are not...careful. ¿Está bien? Muy bien. Gracias. That--that was pretty easy. Yeah, maybe too easy. - How do you mean? - Nothing. What's the most direct route north from here? - I think we're on it. - Well, pull off. Let's try to avoid the main roads. Is this heap gonna make it? If we don't drive it into the ground, I think so, yeah. Let's find a little town where we can rehabilitate ourselves... and hopefully, the car. I’m bettin' on the car. Hey, Luz, you did good back there. I did it for us, not for you. Yeah, well... thanks anyway. What is this? Ricardo Montalban's birthday? These small towns are always looking... for an excuse for a fiesta. Probably remembering some local... who saw the Virgin in a cornfield or something. Excuse me. Mexican in the car. I’m sorry, Luz. Never mind. It's true. Better for us. Easier to get lost. That looks like a hotel over there. You want to check it out? Yeah. You two go check in. Oh...and no secret messages to the clerk. No paper airplanes for help out the window. Nothing you ever read or wrote about. That shit only works on paper. Clear? Good. Because, whether you know it or not... you're both better off with me now... than you would be with the authorities. Really? Now, what happens to us... after we ditch you at the border, assuming we make it? Hostages, temporary insanity. I'll think of something. Let's take care of this life... before we worry about the next. Go on. Room 17. Meet me in that restaurant across the plaza. Ten minutes. We're in room 18. Go ahead, honey. Should we go to the police? In this town? Some old man and his brother-in-law? They probably don't even have guns. By the time the real police or the judiciales get here... we could be dead. We could get in the car, try to make a run for it. Not in that car. But he's right. Where would we go? The judiciales are more scary than he is. If he hadn't killed those three today... we'd both be in jail now. And I would've been fucked... by three men, at least. What should we do? Now you want my advice? You think I would've agreed to drive him... if I had known this was gonna happen? Or let you come with us? I don't know, but you should've known, Danny. I’m sorry, honey. Don't. I'm too angry to take care of you. I’m too tired to make love to you. Where the fuck are we anyway? Somewhere in between-- Never mind. Surprise me later. You ever watch any of those V.D. training films? Sir, I think they stopped showing those... after the Korean War. Damn shame, too, given all the disease roaming around here. You got someone back home? No, sir. You? Nah. I live with this middle-aged woman... who claims to be my wife, but... I stopped arguing with her about it a long time ago. I just stay out of her way. I’m married to Uncle Sam. I’m his bitch, just like you. No, I don't... I don't see-- I don't quite see it that way, sir. Oh. Ha ha. You will. Relationships have a way of... creeping up on you, then all of a sudden, bam! You're screwed. But you’re young. What are you, 11? 12? 25, sir. - Get out. - No. Old fart. You guys are all the same. Iowa? Rifle team? Class president? 4-H Club? No. You're close, sir. Oh! Ohio. And, uh... I couldn’t join the 4-H Club, sir... because my cow died. Good, Weatherford. You must've spent your junior year... abroad from the academy growing a sense of humor. Thank you, sir. Keep it. You'll need it. It might save you... from a razor blade to the wrists one day. Gracias. Let me have the car keys. If you feel like leaving, don't let us stop you. Oh, I wouldn't leave you stranded here. That's why you followed us to the church... in Puerto Vallarta-- the car. I did hear the bartender mention it during the argument. What if Danny hadn't agreed to drive you? I couldn't risk having him finger me. He'd already proved he had a big mouth in the bar. So, what, you would've killed me? Keep your voice down. You're completely amoral. Don't throw your boy scout code of honor in my face. I’ve been fighting battles for you for thirty years. - For me? - Yeah, that's right. While you were jerking off in college... I was shooting people and getting shot at... in Vietnam and Loas and Cambodia and Panama. Well, thanks for killing all those strangers for me. Don't mention it, you pampered, ungrateful bag of shit. How many people have you killed? 300 and change. 300 men? And women and kids... and they were all soldiers. So, you were the good guys? That's what we thought. What'd they think they were? Were they the bad guys because they weren't paying you? Well, I guess morality is pretty subjective. Look at you. You sold yourself... your car, and your girlfriend for five grand. And you're the most self-righteous bastard I know. -I don't kill people for money! - Danny. Don’t tell me! The fiesta's outside, fellas. Oh, I'm sorry. I liked that song, too. Maybe you could like it a little more quietly. Yes, ma'am. Sit down. Sit down, Danny. We'll finish eating and then take a walk. We all could use one. I don't want to take a walk. I wasn't giving you a choice. Would you have shot me, too? No. Maybe it was the way you looked when you tripped... coming down those stairs out of the church. You were waiting for us outside the church? I walked over to you, remember? But I mean before that. You were lying in wait for us? Forget it. I don't want you freaking out again. - Were you or weren't you? -I didn't do it, did I? I can't believe this. You make me sick! - Hey, keep walking. - No! Keep walking. Don't let it spook you. We all brush against death... so many times in our lives without knowing it. This was just one you found out about. It must feel wonderful thinking you have all this power. It’s just business to me. Yeah. If you'd taken better care of business... none of this would've happened. I mean, come on! Two guys in broad daylight? On a crowded street? A little sloppy, don’t you think? I'd been trailing the civilian for days. First time he was exposed. Who was he? I don't know. Some guy who’d been selling something to the Chinese. Computer technology. They don’t tell me that stuff. The U.S. government, that is. So, then why are you running? I wasn't contracted for the other hit-- the navy officer. You mean that was a mistake? I was standing right next to him. Not a technical mistake. A personal one. What do you mean? I knew the guy. I wanted to kill him. Danny? I’m right here, honey. Where were you? Restless. I got some fresh air. What are you doing up? I hear him cry out. Guilt and remorse. Should we go to him? What? No. Let him live with his ghosts. He created them. No use. She's done this before. - The fuel pump's shot. - Can you fix it? Yeah, with a new fuel pump. Any chance of finding one here? No way, not in this burg. I have to take the old one out... find a replacement in a bigger town, like Mazatlán, maybe. How do you get there? There are buses going between these small towns all the time. I could probably get there and back in one day. How far are we from the border? 24 hours driving straight through. But even if we could get this thing started... she'd never make it. Ln fact... we're lucky we found out here. Oh, yeah. Lucky. So, do Luz and I go? You go. Luz stays. I’ll need her to translate. Just hold up the old fuel pump. A picture's worth a thousand words. -I’m not leaving her. - You don't have a choice. Come on, Luz. Danny has a fuel pump to remove. Jeez, man, can’t you wait till we get to the beach? Yeah, you left a trail of piss all the way from Baja. You must have a bladder the size of a little girl's. Yeah, fuck off, both of you. An iguana's gonna bite your dick off in there! It couldn't handle it! It couldn't find it! Hey, you guys! Come here! All right, what now? Come take a look at this! What's up, little buddy? You can't do this yourself? Aw, fuck. Aw, fuck. Don't go down there! Come on! Come on, you guys! Come on! Oh, shit! Come on, you guys! OK. There's a bus out of here in 15 minutes... and another one in three hours. Here's your ticket. Get on that next bus and meet me in Mazatlán. What? What about the fuel pump? There's nothing wrong with the fuel pump. I rigged the engine last night so it wouldn’t start. Danny, we can't leave him here alone. - Really? Why not? - They'll kill him. Well, perfect. Better him than us. - He's been good to us. - To you, yeah. I know he's killed people, but he seems decent. There's an American word for that-- psychopath. What's wrong with you? Nothing! It's just not right! -I can't-- - Yes, you can. You have to! And you will. Now, find an excuse to be alone at 3:00 and get on that bus. Now, here. - OK? - OK. He's right in front of the hotel. - Take that look off your face. - OK. Come and see me off as if nothing's wrong. OK. I’m betting on this guy to win the talent competition. Maybe he thinks we're Hollywood scouts, sir. What's happening, colonel? Excuse me, colonel. Colonel? - Excuse me. - Not now. Excuse me! Well...so much for the good neighbor policy. Tell me. Three men dead-- judiciales. I’m still in charge. Clear? My men are dying. This is our operation now. No. That doesn't change a thing. I disagree, señor. Get in your car. Here it comes. Bye, honey. Adiós, mivida. Don’t worry. I'll see you soon. She'll be all right. Hard saying good-bye. It shouldn't be. I’ve been saying good-bye to Danny since I’ve met him. What do you mean? I’m the girl you leave. The girl you don't marry, you never take home... or even across the border. I’m only fit for someone living in exile or desperation. I’m the desperation girl. I always get left. The question is when. You deserve a lot more. No. You don't know me well enough. Yeah, I do. You want lunch or something? Something. Did you ever pray? Yeah, during the war. When I was being tortured, I prayed I'd die. When I didn't, I gave up on God. It's a sin to pray for death. I don’t think God is even counting my sins anymore. He is. But he forgives you. We are all sinners. I’m tired. Do you mind if I rest? No, not at all. Luz! Luz! I couldn't leave you alone. I know. There's nothing wrong with the fuel pump. Danny wanted me to meet him in Mazatlán. Yeah, I know. The 3:00 bus. I saw him buy the ticket. Then why didn’t you-- I wanted you to stay... but only if you wanted to. The first time I was with Danny, it was for money. I did work at Chulo's... but I didn't make enough money to live on... or to send home. So... sometimes I went with men. Those bikers at the restaurant knew. I am a puta. They didn't know anything... except that you're beautiful. Scum like that think all women are whores. But I was. Danny never throws it in my face... never mentions it. Still, it's always there... I think... in the back of his mind. And now yours. You had a hard time. You had to stay alive. I understand that. What will he think when I don't show up? He'll accept it. If not now, then later. Am I a bad girl? No, no, no. God forgives you. We're all sinners. Bad dream? Yeah, they're all bad. I heard you last night. Same dream, over and over, since the war. Lo siento tanto. Some memories are too terrible to live with. I thought they’d stop after I killed him. Killed who? That guy in Puerto Vallarta. The navy officer. He left me to die in Cambodia, in the jungle. My spotter and I were trapped there. He was supposed to lift us out if things got hot... and he left us. He just flew away. Dios mio. My friend, my spotter... was killed right away. And then I was shot, kicked... stabbed with bayonets... and that guy in the chopper-- Reese-- watched it all... and didn't do a goddamn thing. What happened? I was dragged away... and tortured. The only thing that kept me alive... was hating that fucker Reese. I wanted to live just to get him. Dios castiga. I’m sure God punished him long before you killed him. Not enough. I got away, escaped. Floated down... some river to Thailand. And after they patched me up and I got out of the hospital... I went to work for the CIA... and I never, ever forgot about Reese. But I never saw him again... till that day in Puerto Vallarta. The day I met you. Do you believe in fate? More than that. I believe in miracles. We're gonna need one to get out of here alive. You know that, don’t you? Yes. If we do... will you come north with me? I have a little place in the hills... in Oregon. Deep in the woods-- very quiet, very beautiful. It's a good place to be alone with someone. I would like to. We will replace your bad dream... with a good one. Where are you going? I have a plan. I don't know if it'll work, but it's worth a try. Why can't we just take a bus to the border? No, they'll be looking for me there. Here. Put this on. To replace the one I messed up in Puerto Vallarta. I saw you looking at it in a shop window. Thank you. Back soon. Look at what I’ve been reduced to. Following these idiots around like a perpetual motion machine. Pretty hopeless, isn't it, sir? Yeah. You know, it's my birthday today. Really, sir? No, not really. In a few months. But it would bolster my self-pity... and sense of futility if it were today. Yes, sir. McGrane. It's Price. Where the hell are you? You first. I’m following some Mexican intelligence wunderkind... around the highways and byways of this dysentery factory... trying to find your sorry ass. Now, why would you want to do that? So they don't slaughter you. Better make sure they do. What would be the point of that? To eliminate a nasty... and potentially embarrassing problem. Best way to do that is to get you home. What about Reese? What about him? What's the price for that? Nothing. It was a mistake. You know and they know I don't make mistakes. Officially, it was a mistake. You're getting older. He stepped in your sights. - It was a terrible-- - And ironic. Yeah, a terrible and ironic mistake. It's more convenient for everyone... if you classify it that way. - Why did my ride pull out? - He panicked. - Not your orders? - No. Believe me, we just want to get you out of here now. Tell me where you are. Tell me where you are. I’m in a little town called Zapata. It’s just north of Rosario. Right. Got it. Where should we meet? There's an abandoned church north of town. It shouldn’t take me more than a few hours to get there. I’ll be waiting. Goody. Thinks he's going home, sir? He is... in a box. Hang a "U" at the next curve. Yes, sir. I’m ready! Ready for what? Honey. Surprised? I guess you missed the bus. I told you I couldn't leave him alone. No, you told me you'd follow me, remember? "Adiós, mivida." All that? I waited three hours for you at the bus station at Mazatlán. I’m sorry. No. Forget "I'm sorry." This is bigger than "I'm sorry". And I spent the whole night wondering if he'd killed you... or taken you hostage or raped you. Guess he didn't have to work that hard, huh? - Danny-- - What? I love him. What's the Spanish word for "psychiatrist"? You're with this guy, this murderer... this serial killer for one night-- We've been with him for almost a week now. Oh, it's a week. It's a long-term relationship. I guess a girl could fall for Charles Manson in a week. And it was your idea, remember? - My idea? - Yeah. That you’d fall for him? That'd you leave me stranded? That you’d fuck him right under my nose? Danny-- I guess once a whore, always a whore. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I didn't mean that. It's all right. No, it's not all right. Forget that I said that. I just--I didn't know what happened to you. I didn't know why you didn't-- I thought you would go back... forget, be safe. Can you forget, Luz? Just like that? Can you? Looks like we could use a bigger room. Yankee Stadium wouldn't be big enough. This is what you’ve been after from the beginning, isn't it? It just happened. I think I found a way out of here. There's no way out of here. There are cops and the army in Concordia... and on the road in here to Zapata. We got to take that chance. She doesn't. He's right. They’re just looking for me. You can tell them I forced you and Danny to come along. They'll believe you. They already think I'm out of control. Think? Luz... Luz, stay. Not for me. Do it to save your life. That's what I'm doing. Here. What are you doing? This'll make it more believable. Give us ten minutes. Go down to the plaza. Make a scene about what I did to you and Luz. That should be easy. Your keys, the rest of the money I owe you. - You think I could take that? - A deal's a deal. Yeah, but I never got you there. Buy your self a nice headstone. - Am I going too fast? - No. Where are we going? To a place I found where the jungle meets the town. -Is that it? - Yeah. Someone is going to meet us there? I hope so, Luz. Come on. Wait here. OK. This is a mausoleum. Rich people have themselves buried in the chapel... to be closer to God. We won't be here long. Here we go. He's holding her hostage in the hotel! Right up there. What's that? Our salvation, maybe. Stay here. Is that it, sir? Must be. And there he is-- all packaged and ready for us. Are you going to try and talk to him, sir? I’ve done all my talking, and so has he. Now it's time for you to do your work. Yes, sir. - You with McGrane? - He's outside. Let the girl go first. Why? Just let her go. No. We go together. You're going to push her aside... and this'll be over in two seconds. Step aside, Luz. No, no. No, I thought they came to help us. Well, they lied to me. It doesn't have to go down like this. Tell him we got away. We'll take our chances in the jungle. No, no. No, it's over now. It's you, or it's both of you. Now push her aside. - Get out of the way, Luz! - Move her aside! Stop! Don't kill him! No. Please, no. They'll lie to you someday. When you've done all their dirty work for them. They'll send a younger version of you to kill you. No. Please. ¡Colonel! The girl was with him. She was hit in the line of fire. - Did you set the blaze? - Yes, sir. The place is a huge crypt, sir. It's filled with bodies. Appropriate for Price. I thought the fire would make it impossible... to sort out remains... to complicate matters... in case the locals decided to investigate. I think I underestimated you, Weatherford. Yes, sir. I think you did. What happened? Well, Price is dead. Gunfire ignited the flames. Where's Luz? She was caught in the crossfire. - No! - Yes. No! No! No! Let go of me! It's too late. It's too late. You shot her, didn’t you? You bastards! Look, you want to blame someone, blame Price or yourself... or her. We're not stupid enough to think... either of you was completely innocent. Now, consider yourself lucky to be alive. Oh, my God! Oh, God! Señor. All right, now. Calm down, calm down... before the local boys use you as the scapegoat. You'd better get out of here. That would end things nice and neat for you, wouldn't it? Son, things always end nice and neat for me... whichever way they go. 3,000 U.S., right? Here's your money. - All right, you got it all. - OK.
