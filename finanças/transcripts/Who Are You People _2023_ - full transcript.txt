When I was very young, Sometimes I'd lay in bed at night... and imagined that my family turned into monsters when I fell asleep. Listening to the hum of urban traffic outside my window, I could picture them having wild revelries, sure to explode my 8-year-old mind. And, of course, there was a thoroughly logical belief that they were fattening me up just to eat me. Even now, at the ripe old age of 16, I still catch myself asking the same old question. Who are you people? And lately, rather than recede, that question only gets louder. Consider my father. He's a shark litigator, who simultaneously craves both the nobility of laboring for the disenfranchised and the splatter of blood from those who dare oppose him. Perhaps that's why his emotional communication switch is permanently stuck on "yell." Alex, come on. You're going to be late for school. Jesus H. Christ. Especially when reminded that his 16 year old daughter actually looks 16. Does no one wear clothes anymore? My mother, meanwhile, enjoys smiling. She works in PR, which is by its very nature, the most superficial of superficial professions. Still, -it plays to her strength. -Good to see you. Switching from externalized jubilation to world class detachment. Judith Fixel. Publicly, there's a direct correlation between said detachment and dead eyed Cheshire cat grinning. Privately, that detachment takes a different form. Yeah, Carey and I are taking the girls to visit his mother. Oh, yes. A joy it shall be. But when we get back, let's make a night of it. Okay. Okay. Bye. Not a monster's roar. Do you have to do this right here? You're going to ruin my floors. Something quieter. What do you think of the painting? A reminder that when she's around me, she's never quite there. Your principal called. You're failing pre-calculus. She loves my sisters, though. Their existence is basically a family creation myth. Daddy, tell the story again. Uh, Mommy and I wanted to have more babies. We tried for years and years. And years and years and years and years. - And we saw so many doctors. - Oh! And then we saw this one doctor, who took these teeny little things called embryos, and they put that inside me. - Ew. - Mm-hmm. And then we found out we weren't going to have just one baby. We were going to have two babies. And that's how we got you pair of chuckleheads. Maybe they're just easier. What about Alex? Yes. What about me? You were no trouble. On some level, I wonder whether I keep silently asking and re-asking that fundamental question of just who you people are. Because every moment they seem to be asking the same question of me. Are you going to call in -a guidance counselor? -Dude. I'm really impressed with your writing, though. No, I should have stuck to Holden Caulfield's ducks and spared you my angst. It's horrible. Nothing about you is horrible, Alex. Rohan, I-- I literally have one friend left over from kindergarten and she doesn't even go here. Hence your charity lunches. Your place in the social pecking order forever undefinable. This, too, shall pass. Trust me. It's hard to believe I ever went through the same thing, right? Uh, It's super easy to believe. You are a total nerd. Every weekend, I set aside six hours, just for my book. Just to write. I think you should try it. Maybe you can discipline yourself to write something not so horrible. Okay, so, let's write together. This Saturday. Oh, um, Alex, I don't know if that's appropriate. Rohan, calm down. We're friends, right? Okay. Um, but right now, it's not Rohan, it's-- Mr. Amira. Got it. All right, guys. Let's talk about these ducks, huh? So, wait. You didn't have sex with him? No, his Mom was, like, in the next room. Are you sure it wasn't because you're afraid of herpes? Because if it's herpes, I totally get it. I'm terrified of herpes. Can you please stop saying herpes? Yeah, it travels through your saliva or your skin... and it doesn't even matter if you use a condom, because it's just spreading out there, all over the place all the time, -Mm-hmm. -And it never goes away, because it lives in your fucking spine. It's literally all we talk about in bio is, like... disgusting genitalia scare tactics. And herpes aside, you still have to be, like, way up in their face with, like, all their pimples and blackheads and nose breath and whatever they fucking ate for lunch. -It's disgusting. -Okay. Now all I am thinking about is if he has herpes. -Good. -Okay, look. You just need to find someone. Anyone at your school and just do it already. Your vag is not some sort of sacred temple. - Okay! - It's just a vag. Whatever. Or I don't know. Get your mom to hug you. Funny how you say I'm going-- You are goddamn well going. -My stomach hurts. -It's gonna be okay. Grandma always looks at me like I'm fungus and then asks if I have a boyfriend. I'm telling her I'm gay. -You're not gay. -Maybe I am. Oh, are you coming out? No. I'm just not going to grandma's. Carey. It's okay. She doesn't have to go if she doesn't want to go. If she's in a mood, then it's not worth it. -Come on. -Thanks a lot. You okay, baby? Where does it hurt? Just through here. Hey, so, where are your folks? Oh, they're visiting my grandma. Oh. There's a coffee shop down the street. Maybe we should just go there. You're a tea person, right? Uh-huh. So, what's your novel about? Well, it's kind of complicated, but it's about soldiers in World War One. Write what you know, right? -What? -Uh, nothing. Continue. Okay. So, it's about the first Indian soldiers that show up -at the Western Front. -Yeah. And it's about their experiences, the cultural dislocation. It's not a comedy. Oh. Yeah. Never heard you talk about your work before. -It's so cool. -Oh! -Alex, come on. -Oh, I'm not a virgin. Look, I'll just see you on Monday, -okay? -Hey, Rohan. -You good? -Yeah. Alex! Rose got sick, so we turned-- Oh, my-- Jesus. Are you okay? - Yeah. - Really? You okay? Are you sure? What kind of fucking teacher hangs out with his students? What the hell is he doing here? - Calm down. - No. He's a grown man, you're 16! He's lucky I don't murder him. You want to explain what the fuck he was doing here? Okay, you are the adult. I am the adult! You know who's not the adult? Alexandra Fucking Fixal! This is very difficult to explain. What's his name? Rohan? Amira? We should press charges. We have a-- we have a-- a moral obligation, right? We should sue the whole school. She invited him here. That's beside the point. I just don't think I'll ever understand what would possess her to do something so aggressively stupid. Okay. Okay. But you made your point. - So let's just drop it. - Okay. Well, we certainly know she didn't get this bullshit from me. Wait, I-- I did not mean -to say-- -Yeah, you did. Judith. I said the wrong thing. Hey, Mom? -Sorry. -You scared me. Alex, you need to be careful. There's enough trouble out there, without you going to look for it. I wasn't looking for trouble. I knew what I was doing. Y-- you brought a strange man into our home. He wasn't strange. -I knew him. -You don't know a fucking thing. Okay, you know what? It's been a long day. What were you looking at? I think we should both get some sleep before we go another round. All right. I am Mrs. Rumble, your sub. And it looks like we are finishing up Catcher in the Rye. Jailbait. Who actually read the book from the SparkNotes? Excuse me? Excuse me? What's her name? Ooh! Mom? Dad? "Dear Judith... I haven't expected you to respond to my letters before, and I don't expect it now, either. Truthfully, I don't know what I'd say other than I'm sorry for what happened a few months ago. How things between us ended, and how they never should have begun. I'm back in Washington now, so you don't have to worry about seeing me. I imagine you never want to see me again... and I don't blame you. I never want to see me again, either. It's unfair to tell you I think about you, but I do. Karl." Alex? Coming. We need to talk to you. So, um, I have a question. Not now. Park it. Okay. So, um, I read this-- We've arranged for you to start boarding school next week. They're liars. Like, legit liars, both of them. And now they got their excuse to ship me to boarding school. They can finally get rid of me. Okay, you don't even know what this letter means. It is from six months before I was born. That's a fucking coincidence now? Plus, all those fertility treatments for the twins? Carey shoots blanks. Okay, well, this Karl guy could be, like, a serial killer. How many serial killers seem that contrite about home-wrecking? I don't have a lot of experience -with serial killers, Alex. -He was like an artist, right? Maybe my mom had an affair with him, she wasn't so, like-- her. Well, they could just look at your Insta and know that you're lying. Then I'll delete it, good fucking riddance. -Hey. -Listen. I've known Judith's password since I set up her PayPal account. After they drop me off, I'll just email the school something like, "My husband and I have reconsidered Alex's enrollment and have opted to place her in a private school here in Portland. We're sending a family friend to retrieve her tomorrow. Feel free to contact my direct line with any questions or concerns." And what if they email her back? Then I will block their email on Judith's account. -I get creative, Nancy. -What if they call her? - What then? - Judith Fixel. Hello, yes. I understand we need to forfeit the tuition paid. We made a huge mistake and we feel the need to keep Alex close to us. You're going to the bus station, right? Uh, yeah. So you've, like, already stalked him? Yeah, I already have his address and stuff. Okay, whatever. Le-- let's just say that this works. Are you sure you don't just, like, want this Karl guy to be your dad? What, like, everything's just going to magically make sense? I mean, what if he just... Sucks? Well, I'll have to find out. Right? Yes? Um, I'm looking for Karl Hendrix. Karl, there's somebody here to see you. So are you his girlfriend or? -Cousin. I'm his cousin. -Oh! Yeah. Hello. I'm Alex. Alexandra. Judith's kid. Judith? Why don't you come in? Um, could you just give me a moment, please? -Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Thanks. - That's my-- - I know. It's gonna be all right. I need to talk to your folks. All right. Yeah. Did it work? -Hi, Mom. -W-- what? Mom? Yeah, I got here okay. Uh, Alex, what are you talking about? Sure. Yeah. He was really surprised. I-- I'm not your mom. Yeah, I love you too. - Alex! - The phone. You said this wouldn't come back on me. Where are you putting me in the middle of this? Why are you doing everything that you said you wouldn't-- Hello, am I speaking to Alex's mother? Hello? Why did-- why did she hang up on me? Oh, um, she didn't want to talk to you. She said you'd understand. -Excuse me? -Uh, where did he go? Your mother didn't tell him about you. Well, I'm-- I'm here now. How about you stay for dinner? You're not eating anything. Oh, it's so good. Um, I just- I'm a vegetarian. Oh. See, when I was three, my parents took me to this barbecue and someone offered me a hamburger. And I asked my, uh, my dad, um, "Where does hamburger come from?" And he said, "Well, it comes from the cow." And I said, "You mean the cow makes it like it makes milk?" Because I just learned that about milk. And he said, "No, Alex, the cow is the burger." So, then, little me ran around, saying to everybody, "How would you feel if the cow ate you?" Which is probably the proudest my dad's ever been of me, because he thought I'd be a lawyer. - Your dad's a lawyer? - Yeah. An ode to liberal hypocrisy. And you're a mechanic? How long have you been a mechanic for? About eight years. Do you like it? Karl. So how did you and my mom meet? So were you, like, apprentice mechanicing when you met her, or how exactly does-- I think you should head home. I didn't ask for a daughter. I don't want some kid running around. Listen, you don't have to -worry about me. -Go! Wow, um, I'm-- I'm so touched by your enthusiasm to meet the fruit of your loins. Nice to fucking meet you. Fuck! Come inside. It's freezing out here. I'll just find a motel or something. -It's fine. -Don't be silly. You'll stay here and I'll make up the guest room. You just caught him off guard, is all. -Yeah. -Good. Let's go. -Hi. -Good morning. Uh, where did Karl go? He had an appointment. Oh. We were thinking that it might be nice if you stayed for a while. Give you both a chance to get to know each other a little? We? Yes. Well, I have to go to school. I teach the third grade. Karl will be back from work at six. Dinner is at seven. Um, so, I guess that means you should just make yourself at home. Hello? Karl? What are you doing here? I wanted to see where you work. Okay, well, you've seen it. Sorry. Didn't mean to spy. What exactly do you want from me? I don't know. Uh, get to know you or something? Look... I'm sorry your mom didn't tell you about me. She didn't tell me about you, either. But I don't want you sticking around, expecting something that's not going to happen. What's so bad about me? What? Just-- I'm your kid and you can't even look at me? -Give it! -No! -It's mine! -No, it's not! - Hello? - No! - I had it! - No. Hey, Alex. It was mine. - No, it was on my bed. - What's wrong? Nothing, Dad. Hi. Hey, guys. Guys, guys. Can you please quiet down, so I can figure out how to turn this thing on? -Uh, hit input. -I hit input. Oh, look at that. Great job, kiddo. Yeah, I'm like the Swiss Army Knife of humans. Um, I was wondering if maybe this, like, whole boarding school thing was a mistake? Maybe I should come home? I can navigate the hell out of the television. We talked about this, kid. Yeah, you're right. So... how's school? Food's edible. My roommate has night terrors. Made out with the headmistress. -Couldn't resist. -Jesus Christ, Alex. Why do you ha-- Is that a model airplane? Uh-huh. What are you, like, seven? In 1952? What are you listening to? Jupiter Symphony. Hm. That's charming. You're not a fan? I just hate how everyone acts like classical music is so amazing just because a bunch of rich old people get off on flaunting their cultural superiority to the rest of us plebeians with our simple tastes. Rich old folk like me? I didn't-- I didn't mean you. There was a lot of junk... but that's not what survived. This is Mozart. Mathematically perfect. No note out of place. Very clean. Everything in perfect order. Now, Beethoven. Beethoven was more emotional, more dangerous. There was order, sure. But, uh... not like Mozart. Who do you like better? They weren't competing. Beethoven grew up listening to Mozart. They were both masters. Yeah, but whose music do you like better? Mozart. It's Sunday! Time for church. Come on. Let's go. You know I don't believe in any of that stuff. I know. I don't care. Get ready. I'm culturally Jewish. Morning. Would you like some? Bacon is one of life's great pleasures. And what about Jesus? Yes, bacon and Jesus. This vegetarian thing of yours... it's not going to last. Have you always gone to church? She goes, I go. You go there. It's not what you did or... who you used to be. It's focusing on who you are now and who you're going to be tomorrow. What? Uh, nothing, you're just-- you're just one of those. One of what? Like a born-again that talks about how awesome religion is all the time. You're going to move back to Israel? Why Israel? For the rapture, you know? Jews all go-- The rapture? Are you kidding me? Please tell me you're joking right now. -Gayle. How are you? -Oh, you know. Grading papers, living large. You remember my cousin, Karl? Oh, yeah, the famous mechanic. -Hi, Karl. -Hi. -And this is Alex. -Hey. -Nice seeing you. -Likewise. All right then. Shall we? ♪ Amazing Grace ♪ ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch ♪ ♪ Like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost ♪ I need to go to the bathroom. ♪ But now I'm found ♪ ♪ 'Twas blind ♪ ♪ But now I see ♪ Wanna smoke? No thanks, I quit. You Juul? Uh, nope. You know I don't, like, bite, right? So, uh... who are you? I'm Sarah Kelly's cousin. I'm living with her and Karl. -I'm Alex. -Okay. Arthur. P.S., no one ever really quits, they're just lying to themselves. Where are you from? Portland. You left Portland to come here? What the fuck is the matter with you? So, so much. Well, uh, what do you think of our heavenly church? Uh, religion is almost as dumb as astrology. Yeah, but an astrologist won't call you a god-defying faggot. Then why do you come here? Because my parents fucking make me. Don't your parents make you do shit? Uh, they try. - What's your Insta? - Deleted it. -Deleted all of the apps. -Oh. I'm pretending my life is amazing or complaining that it isn't. Either way, incredibly depressing. You said you're staying with Karl Hendrix, right? Oh, yeah, I see it. Do you know him at all? Uh, not really, but I heard he got loaded a couple of years ago and put his fucking fist through a window. I don't know. Would you want to maybe get out of here? I should probably go back inside. Bye, Arthur. Bye, Alex. Here we are. Again. You really know how to fix these things? Otherwise I'd be lying to people. So, who is Mr. Kelly and where are his sons? Mr. Kelly is Sarah's dad. Named the place before he had any kids. And when his kids were all girls, he just kept the name. Well, you must have been some exceptional cousin for her to give you this. My mom's cousin, actually. Oh, shit. New grandma. A grandma that died years ago. Well, what about my grandfather? Can I meet him? Not in this lifetime. But what was he like? He was a mean drunk. Is that why you went to Portland? How old were you? I was about 20, 21, I guess. So, let me get this straight. Your dead mom's cousin just, like, gave you this place? You know, you ask a lot of questions. Oh, and Gayle, what is up with her? That wasn't a request for more. I think it's really weird that you, like, don't date at all. What's up with that? Let me ask you something. You've been here, what, four days? Your parents okay with you missing school? I'm on break. You can call and ask. Yeah. That's what made you decide now is the time to take this trip? Nothing you'd rather keep to yourself? I'm going to make you a deal. You hold off on asking me questions I'm not comfortable answering just yet, and I'll do the same, okay? -Cool. -Cool. It's cool you know how these things work. My parents are completely useless. They can't even program a smart TV. They went to college, right? Got good jobs? They're a product of their social class. There's nothing noble about being ignorant. Not knowing shit about shit is nothing to celebrate. Got me? So, who do we have here? Spotted your new guest last Sunday. You gonna introduce us? Alex, this is Sheriff Stratford. Hi. May I help you with something? Just wanted to stop by, catch up. You see me every week at church. I do. Saw you in church a few years back as well. You know how that worked out. Well. All right. Brandon says hi, by the way. I saw Gayle at school today. She asked about you. Is that a corner piece? -Yes. -Okay. Oh, yes. Look at that. What are you doing? Did you do that? Yeah. Judith thinks it's, like, a massive waste of time. No, you're good. Hm, not really. Better than I ever was. Hey, this is my mom, right? Your mom... discovered me. - What? - Yeah. -My mom? -Yeah. I went to Portland to be an artist. Liked the idea of being around bookstores and museums. And anyways, I was bussing at a café down on Alberta. The owner must have felt sorry for me, I think, because he put one of my pictures on the wall. "Featured Local Artist" with this stupid $200 price tag. Your mom came in sometimes. She used to like to write in her notebook. One day, I was clearing her table, and she said that she liked it, and I said that I drew it. And, uh... she was almost giddy. She knew a lot of people in a lot of different places and said she'd help me organize a show. She was the only one to give a damn. So that's how it started... with you two? Before I met her, she said she had been a party girl. And then she married this big shot lawyer and became something different. They were trying to have a baby, and it wasn't working. So I think she saw my drawings and figured it'd be something to do. So, what happened? Did she put on your art show? - My mom? - No. No, we-- we had some postcards printed up, and that's about it. How come? How come? Because... I wasn't always such a good guy and... your mom found that out. I saw the letter that you wrote her. Having an affair isn't, like, awesome, but, uh-- You got me out of it, right? Yeah, I guess we did. Was there something else that was, like... bad about you? I have an early morning. Uh, can I keep that? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. -Good morning. -Morning. So, uh, where's Karl? Meeting. So, it's a "I accept Jesus as my savior so I won't get bombed" type thing? Not to, like, offend Jesus or anything. No, Jesus has heard worse. Do you really think he believes in it? Because you act like he does and he acts like he does, but... Kind of seems like he just wants to believe it. I'm truly glad you're here. I think it's good for him. And I don't care what you think of my faith... but maybe you want to think that Karl doesn't really believe either, and that's something the two of you could share. But those beliefs saved him. Well, I'm not the only one who thinks that. Sheriff called him out on it, too. You met the sheriff? Did Karl, like, steal his prom date or something? No. I'll be back tonight. Please tell Karl that dinner is at 7:00. Okay. Hi. -Can I help you? -What's your problem with Karl? - You're his kid, right? - Mm. You should be a detective. I hate uncomfortable silences. I'm fine with them. -Your mom know you're here? -Of course. Have a seat. So what's your issue? We used to bust your old man pretty routinely. Drunk and disorderly. Disturbing the peace, that sort of thing. Last time he fell off the wagon, he put his fist through a storefront window. Were you, like, emotionally invested in that window? About a dozen years ago... your dad got loaded. Beat the crap out of a 19-year-old varsity linebacker named Brandon in a bar fight. Kid lost his hearing in his left ear. Arm was in a cast for weeks. Supposed to go to the army. They wouldn't take him. You're weirdly concerned with the well-being of your residents. Especially when they're my son. After that, Karl got put away. He had some priors, served five. Well, he goes to meetings now. I've seen all kinds of drunks. Kind that are good for a laugh, tell you how much they love you. But Karl Hendrix gets violent. He is a drunk, dangerous criminal. And a drunk, dangerous criminal doesn't really change because he goes to an AA meeting. Or says he found God or what have you. I know it's not an excuse or anything, but he had a really hard life. His dad sounds like a total asshole. Yeah, I know Beau Hendrix. -You knew him? -No, I know him. Well, he's dead, right? He lives two towns over in Bryantville. Karl told you he was dead? Do you have the address? Who are you? I'm Alex. Your granddaughter. Maybe-- maybe this is a bad time. No. It's a fine time. Let's sit on my porch. Granddaughter Alex. So. I haven't seen Karl in going on, what? Ten years? Didn't know about you. I'm kind of like a-- a long story. Well, I got time. Hey, Reg. Look who's here. Have you seen Alex? Sarah mentioned you talked and she hasn't been home. -So-- -You all right there? Tried her on her cell phone? I don't have the number. Father of the year. Please. I just need to know where she went, that's all. I'm not certain where she went. I can tell you there's a lot she doesn't know. Thought her grandfather was dead, for one thing. So it, like, turns out that we sort of have the same, like, drawing style. Like, I don't know if-- if I really believe in the nature over nurture argument, but I really do think that, like, there might be, like, some sort of compelling argument for the fact that, like, genes affect artistic stylings, you know? You know, um... Karl and Sarah are probably wondering where I am. Who Sarah? Karl's cousin, Sarah Kelly. His mom's cousin, Sarah Kelly? -The church lady? -Yeah. Uh, he runs her shop and he's actually, like, a really good mechanic. How about that? Oh, he's-- he's here. Alex. Karl. Come here. So. Where you been hiding yourself? Keep busy. This is great. Sit down, have a beer. No, we can't stay long. What are you talking about? You just got here. Sit down, have a beer. Alex here was telling me you two draw alike. More artists! That's what we need. Did he tell you I worked 40 years at the plant? Got to know your place, right? You're not thirsty? No, I'm all right. Oh. Oh. I get it. You and the bottle. It never led anywhere good. You know what, it's getting late-- Maybe if you would have sobered up sooner or you wouldn't have put that kid in the hospital. I mean, of all the asses in the world you gotta kick... that's the one you choose? -We should get going. -Why that kid, Karl? I really want to know. I didn't like the way he was touching that girl at the bar, Dad, I told you that already. Well, that's an answer. -That's a fucking-- -You're an asshole. -What was that, honey? -Alex, stop-- No, you're a bully and you don't like your son because he's better than you. Who the fuck do you think you are? Huh? Huh? What you got? Huh? Stop! Visit's over. Get out of here. -I'm so sorry. -The hell were you thinking? You-- you told me he was dead. It ever occur to you I had a reason? Shit. Fuck. I'm sorry. I-- I suck, I suck, I suck. Get in the car. -Get in the car. -You can yell at me some more. You're going home tomorrow. Hi. Dinner will be ready in five... minutes. You stalker. So, shockingly, I have fucked everything up. Well, at least you and your dad were getting along well. Yeah, if by getting along well you mean yelling at me a lot. Which I guess is, like, par for the course of parents, right? He was probably scared something had happened to you. He screamed because he gives a shit. So how long have you known you were gay? Okay, you're from a major metropolitan city, so you've seen probably every weird form of pansexuality out there. I mean, you have probably fucked girls. Oh, yeah. My life is just a big orgy. Yeah, I'm sure it is. -You didn't answer my question. -You didn't answer mine. Have you hooked up with a girl? Have you? I'm a godless fag, remember? Really? -Alex-- -It's okay. Okay, I gotta go. Okay. You disappeared again. Are you kidding me? Apparently not. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where the hell did you go? -I was with Arthur. -The gay kid? -Pretty sure he's not gay. -How the hell do you know that? -How is that your business? -You know, as long as you're in this house, you do exactly-- Oh, until tomorrow? Go to your room. -Go to your room. -Oh, go to my room? That's so original, "Dad." She shouldn't be here. You should have sent her away. Excuse me? I lost control today. I saw him and I lost control. If she knew who I am... -who I really am. -Nobody is one thing, Karl. You most of all. Besides, I know who you are. Listen... these are just challenges. You will get past them. That's all part of His plan. Every bad thing is part of some test? Are you sure you just don't want to believe that? I believe it because I believe it. That's what faith is. Now come on. You know what to do. Sarah's making breakfast downstairs. Okay. I'm sorry I yelled at you. I was worried. I shouldn't have said that, uh... I shouldn't have made you think your grandfather was dead. So... yeah. And you don't have to, um... I don't want you to leave. I should get your number, probably. -Okay. -Okay. So, what, were you out with that Arthur kid? -Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah, okay. All right. Do you have any questions about sex you want to ask me? What? -From you? -Yeah. Ew. And no more of this "I suck" shit. You don't. You don't because I said so. So how's your mom? Are we allowed to have this conversation? It might compromise your mystery. Serves me right. So I made out with my teacher. Okay. You gonna get all weird? No. Yeah, it was impulsive and dumb. And of course, Carey and Judith walked in on us, which is even more mortifying than describing it to you right now. -Well, I didn't ask you. -Well, I'm trying to explain. Anyways, they're, like, super pissed. But they didn't even, like, ask me why. They were just like, "Oh, yeah, there goes our idiot daughter being a jackass again." They didn't respect me enough to want to know why. -So they're not perfect. -It's an understatement. Better than some. Alex, Karl! Dinner! Coming! Alex, are you okay? Yeah. What's up? Your dad's asleep. What's going on? Mom, um, were you ever in a band? - What? - Okay. I know this isn't, like, the most opportune time to ask, but did you ever, like, play in a rock band? Well, before you were born, I did lots of things. You never told me. You didn't ask. I totally asked. We were called My Friend's Band. - Seriously? - Yeah. And my friend, Marco, he was the lead singer, he said that the hot chick had to play the bass, so. - Wait, you were the hot chick? - Hey. You try squeezing out three kids. See how you look. I forgot to tell you, I'm pregnant. Obviously, I'm kidding. I mean, not the best joke, you know? Mom, are you there? Hey, Alex. Yeah? How's school going? Good. It's going good. How's your roommate, what was her name again? The one that has night terrors? Night terrors? Oh, uh, right, um, Natalka. I think she's, like, Ukrainian or something. Speaking of which, she's sleeping right now, so I have to go. Hello? Oh, Mrs. Fixel. What can I do for you? -Hi, Dad. -Are you all right? -Where are you? -Dad, stop yelling. -I'm fine. -The hell you're fine. Where are you, Alex? Alex, please. Please, just-- where are you? - Tell us where you are. - I'm fine. -I'm with a friend. -She said she's with a friend. She doesn't have any fucking friends, hold on. Can you tell dad not to have an aneurysm? Hey. How long did you think that you were going to keep this up? Hm? What exactly is your plan here? Do you think about anybody but yourself? Do you imagine any consequences of your actions? Because you are in so much trouble-- Let's order some food. Come on. Son of a bitch. Yes, this is Sheriff Reggie Stratford calling from Newburgh in Washington. The phone call seemed to spook you. What happened? I may have to go back soon. It's home stuff. The Sheriff said some things. I'm not proud of what happened with Brandon. But he was bothering a girl that night, and... it was two drunk hotheads fighting and I won. But there's other things that happened-- Maybe I don't need to know. I thought I did, but maybe I don't want to know because I like you now. Hey, Karl. Got the food. -Two burgers. -Yes, sir. Burgers? Are you serious? Ew. Who is this? That's my daughter, Alex. I regret nothing! You could have at least tried it. No. Are you kidding me? My friend Nancy didn't eat meat for five years... -And? -...and she had a chicken cutlet of sandwich and she vomited all over herself. Alex hasn't been entirely honest with us. You're looking at possible kidnapping, and you're crossing state lines-- Shit, shit, shit, shit. Fuck-- Please, Alex, language. - God damn it, fuck! - Alex, enough! You called them? Why would you call them? - It's my job? - Shit, shit, shit. Listen, I lied to everyone. Karl had no idea I snuck away. It's my fault, okay? I'm a fucking idiot. I'm a fucking-- -It's not-- you're not-- -Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I'm going to be okay. Okay? Everything's going to be fine. Sheriff Stratford. I know you don't owe me anything... but could you give us a minute? And then you could take her away. You can arrest me. I don't care. Just give us one minute. Please. Sarah, got another cup of coffee? One last cup. Sit down, okay? Please? It's-- I haven't seen your mom in a long time. You don't have to say anything, -it's fine. -But the thing of it is-- I told you before. I was maybe 21 when I met your mom. I'd been in the city a few months, And I had no money. I didn't have any real friends and... I was-- I was drinking a lot. And even though she was older and she was married-- Yeah, you hooked up anyway. Hold on. We went on walks. mostly talking about the art show she was going to put on and-- I didn't know if it was real... but I was grateful that it might be. And one night when I got off work... she was really upset. Some fight with her husband, some problem with another doctor. So we went to a bar for a drink. And that drink turned into a couple of drinks. And then a couple of more drinks. And... we talked about everything. And it felt so good to be around her. I didn't notice how many drinks we'd had. And, um... after a while... I got up to use the bathroom. and she said she'd better use it, too. And I think I took that as a signal. Because we went back there and, um... she smiled at me. And... That's how it started. - Hi, you must be Judith. Where is she? Alex? -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Calm down. Hi. Uh, hello. How are you? Sheriff Stratford. We done here? Yeah, you're done. Okay. Come on. We're leaving. -Come on. -Dude, Carey, stop. - Let go. - Carey? Could we just have a minute, please? No, you had a week. -You don't get shit. -You're such a hypocrite. You-- you act all open minded, and you're judging him because he goes to church and he works with his hands. Alex, you have nothing to say to this man. This man should be locked up. All right, this is my house and you will not speak to Karl-- Affair? - It wasn't a fucking affair. - Carey. There was no affair. Tell her. Tell me what? So we used to go for these walks. -Yeah. -And-- and-- We-- we went into a bar one night, and I was really drunk. And then we-- we went into the bathroom. Look at me. And we started kissing. And we were alone. No one else was there. But when I told him to stop... he didn't. Can I just-- ca-- can I just-- No, you can't. Hey, hey! -Stop it -Okay. It's time for you to go. Right now. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. She's a good girl. Good artist. Good artist? I've wanted to say sorry for such a long time, I-- Well, now you've said it. Alex. Alex. Alex. Please. Give it some time. See if... A little time. Please. Where are the twins? With their grandmother. 7:00 am tomorrow we are out the door. Are you seriously calling me right now? Don't hang up. It all happened wrong. She's the only thing that felt like any kind of home to me. In the way she looked at me, in the way she talked to me. I thought she wanted those things, too. And then I was-- I was so humiliated and angry and drunk. It's like I stepped out of myself. You're the victim in this? You really want me to feel sorry for you? No. No, no. No, I just-- I just wanted to tell you-- You know what else sucks? I think back on everything you ever said to me, like, all this, "I don't like who I used to be" bullshit. And I feel so stupid. I just wanted to tell you that that wasn't me. -I don't remember. -But it is you. You did it. Now I know why my mom can't look at me. Because when she looks at me, all she sees is you and now that's all I'm going to see. -Don't ever call me again. -Alex. Where's Dad? He needed a walk. I'm sorry that happened to you. It was a long time ago. -Yeah, but it still happened. -Yeah. Mom. Do you think I'm, like... dirty? No. No, honey, of course not. N-- No. Why didn't you get rid of me? Your father, um... both of us, we were trying to have a baby, and we had trouble, and then... This happened. -So. -But you thought about it? Yeah. Yeah, I'm not easy like the twins, am I? Just every time you look at me... you see him. It was 17 years ago, Alex. Yeah, for you. For me, it was... - 45 minutes ago. - Okay. I don't think you're dirty. And I love you very much, but I can't do this right now, okay? -So please go to sleep. -Okay. But do you want to talk about it? Because you kept his letter. -No. -I think that's important-- -I just want to go to sleep. -Mom, like, I-- I'm not looking for a chance to, like, plumb new depths of awkwardness, okay? I-- I-- I really-- I don't want to talk about it. Have you talked to a shrink? I think you should talk to a mental health professional. That's not how I work. Okay, but, uh, now that I know about it, I-- I can't pretend like it didn't happen. Alexandra, nobody told you to go looking for him. Karl. come back in the house. Just going for a little ride. No, Karl, you have been drinking, I can smell it on you. You need to go to a meeting. You know I'm right. Karl, don't get in that car. You know that if you do this, there's nothing but trouble. Karl, listen to me! -Karl. -I'm fine. I got Jesus watching over me. Karl. Hi, go-- go to the other window. The other window. My parents found out everything, and now they're here, and we leave in a few hours. Oh. I-- I was just asleep. Shouldn't I go brush my teeth? I mean-- I mean, if it's not bad-- -Okay. -Do you have a condom? Uh, I-- I think so. I think I have a pack in my nightstand, but maybe they're expired, which isn't very safe, so maybe we should-- Oh. -Okay, whoa, whoa. -What? Hey, I just-- Hey, hey, hey. We don-- You-- Are sure you want to? Because we don't know each other too well and-- Can I please just do this? It's natural, biological. It doesn't make that everyone, like, freak out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. -I think you're freaking out. -No, I want to do this. You ladies-- Do you want to have sex with me or not? Yes, I-- Yeah, I mean... I-- I think so. What happened tonight? It just comes rushing back, you know? The thousands of times that I see myself with my hands just wrapped around his neck. And yet I am a grown and rational adult, so not killing him is what separates us from the beasts. We should have fucking pressed charges. We had the case, we had the moral obligation to do it and we didn't do it. What are you talking about? We've had an obligation to-- Look, there are lines that men do not cross. Now you're going to talk to me about men? I'm-- I'm just trying to put this thing to bed. No, what it feels to me like is that you are determined to make this about you and your justice. But I am not gonna let you make my life be about this one thing. No, I-- I never said it-- it was about-- Okay, you know what? Let's say you're right, okay? And I had gone and upended my life... and traded our privacy for... your ego and put your little monster in jail. Does that satisfy Carey's justice? So what, are we supposed to keep sweeping it under the rug and pretending like it just never happened? So... Except that you don't actually sweep it all the way because apparently you kept his fucking letter. Which is why we're here in a motel. Jesus Christ. Don't you hate him? You're such a sweet man. You never even asked what the hell I was doing there. Well, it's a good question. What the hell were you doing there? There just was so many doctors appointments. You know, and it was--- It was hard to feel like we weren't... failing each other sometimes. And then when I was with him, I just-- I-- I just felt... lighter. Well... you were with him tonight, do you still feel fucking lighter? How I feel about Karl Hendrix, that's my business. It's not yours. He thought she was this cool arty chick and he was this, like... interesting, offbeat guy. And they met and connected. And that was me. It felt like I came from something good. Well, obviously you're, like... done, right? Probably won't be back here. Yeah, but we'll see you again. You should come to Portland. I'll find you boys. Maybe I don't want you to. Yeah, maybe. Oh. I'd hoped he was with you. Hey. Came to have that drink. What the hell are you doing? I want to have a drink with my dad. Go home. You like my bonfire? Put it out. You put it out. - Watch yourself. - Come here. - I know my place. I-- - Do you? Hm? Huh? Karl! Stop. Sarah's worried about you. Let me drive you to your house. That's not my house. That's her house. Reggie, get him off my property. Karl! Stop or I will stop you. Bullshit. What are you doing? I don't care why you were there. I'm here now. I'm going to go apologize to Alex for lying to her and then I'm going to remind her that no matter what the fuck the biology says, I raised her. Then my daughter and I are going to have a fucking conversation. Judith. The car's gone. -Hi, Mom. -You get home right now. Do you hear me? Alex, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry that I didn't tell you the truth. I'm sorry. You're not dirty. You're not bad. We could talk about-- we could talk about it until-- until I'm blue in the face. But I need you to come home now, okay? You all right? Yeah, um, I'm sorry I bailed again. Uh, there's just something I have to do, and I'll be back soon. You know about the Puritans, Reg? They believe you're either damned or you're saved the minute you're born, so they go through their entire lives being good just to prove that they're saved. Pressure got so bad, one woman drowned her kids just to prove that she was damned. Couldn't take not knowing. I know, Reg. Sorry. Karl, I'm sorry. I know what kind of father he was. But you got to leave him be now, all right? Come on, you waited for this. I was the one that beat up your damn kid. I was the one that ruined his life. Maybe I overlooked his shortcomings. -Can't help you-- -Damn it! Just calm down. That's it. Final warning. Come on. Come on, Reg. Go ahead. -What do you got? -I mean it. Come on! Come on! Stop. Stop me! - Stand down, Karl! - I said stop me! - I mean it! - Don't! Hey. All right, how about letting me drive? Go ahead. Our flight leaves soon. Yes. You know... I never married. And I didn't have children. And when he got out, I thought, "Oh, well... there's somebody who needs help." But we're barely... I mean, he's not even my-- Neither is Carey. He's still my dad. And maybe it's a test. Maybe it's God's test. You don't believe in that. You don't care what I believe. All that matters is whether you do. Right. Well, -no more cutting school, okay? -Yes, ma'am. Come here. -Bye. -Bye. "Hey, Arthur. Sorry it's taken me so long to write. I wish I could say I had a good excuse. Because I was off having pansexual underground orgies or going to only the hottest club openings, but sadly..." -Well, look who's here. -Yeah, I'm finally back. "...I think I'm still trying to process stuff." Thank you. "At least that's what the shrink my parents are making me see says..." Alex? Hi. Come on back. "...keeps me out of boarding school." How are you? -Good. -Good. "Which is great because I love my school..." Next up, The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton. "...so much." Jailbait. So, who got through the first chapter? Okay, I do not snore! You're just telling me that I snore now? No, no, no, no, -it's a little tiny noise. -Okay. "My parents are also seeing a therapist. This is good because they are basically the reason therapy was invented." I mean, you can always just sleep on the couch. - Okay. - Problem solved. "As for how I'm doing, I'm okay. Everything feels different, but everything also sort of feels exactly the same. When I first got back, I sort of thought my room would be a different color or something." Circumcised, uncircumcised, very different things. "I thought I should cut my hair or pierce my nose or get some dumb Chinese character tattoo that means strength or something. Just to be like, 'Hello, world. I'm different now.' And then I thought, 'Wow. How boldly cliché.' In general, I'm trying to suck less." "I haven't talked to Karl. Right now, I'm smoking a cigarette, poorly, just for you. Come visit. If anyone asks how we knew each other, I guess I can just lie. I mean, better get used to that, right? Love, Alex." Hey. Dad. Can you knock? It's him. I'll be right outside. Hello? Hey there. I figured it'd be better to be direct with your folks. - Mm-hmm. - How are you? - Okay. - Are you back at school? Yeah. Parents all right? - Mm-hmm. - Good. Good. Sorry it took so long to call you, it's, uh, spent a couple more months back in, uh... Reggie told them to take it easy on me, if you can believe that. Okay. We had a good time here tonight. Gayle from Sarah's work came by and.. I just-- I just slipped out to call you. Sounds like we're being rude. I needed to tell you something. Um... okay. That last night you were here... when I was, uh, I was drunk out of my mind... I was talking to Reggie about Puritans. And how hard it was for them not knowing if they were damned. Well, the worst part isn't not knowing. The worst part is knowing. That's how it was until, uh... Until what? ...'til you showed up. My mouth is full of toothpaste. I know you have to go, but, uh, we were-- I was, uh, I was thinking... that maybe when the weather warms up and-- and, you know, if it's okay with your parents, that... well... maybe you could visit some time. No. I mean, maybe. I don't know. Alex? Alex? I'm here. Okay. Well, um... I'll let you go.
