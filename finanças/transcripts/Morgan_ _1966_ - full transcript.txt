The lowland gorilla, the biggest most powerful of the living primates, lives in the dense forest of tropical Africa, in very inaccessible places. Adult males have an arm span of eight feet and can weigh over 600 pounds. The gorilla's life in the wild remains something of a mystery. We do know that gorillas roam about in family groups, spending most of their time on the ground. At night, they retire to the trees, tucking the leaves and branches around to make comfortable nests. Despite their great canine teeth, gorillas are strict vegetarians and are very fussy about their food. They like wild fruit, tender, ripe berries, and the soft young shoots of tropical plants. Eating daintily and holding their meal in their hands. Gorillas have no natural enemies and they are enemy to no one. Young gorillas stay with their mother for several years, remaining safe even from the attacks of a predatory leopard. An angry adult male gorilla, however is a formidable sight. Surprised by an intruder, he will tear down great branches, roar his anger, and beat his chest. - Leonie. - Hello, Leslie. - You're early. - It's entirely your father's fault, he ordered the car half an hour too soon. - Hello. - Not now, be silent. No more, love. Wait! Leonie! Mrs. Delt, would you tell the court what your husband did then? He shaved my dog. Shaved your dog, how? He shaved a hammer and sickle on its back. A hammer and sickle. And the breed of dog? A poodle, do we have to go into all these details? Let me put it this way, your husband wanted to hurt you so he, well, defaced the dog. I assume he hated the poor, dumb creature. Morgan loves animals. It was me he was getting at. I hope she's not going to offer that woman a lift. You remember Wally, don't you Leonie? Oh yes, the greatest wrestler of them all. He's a great comfort to me, is Wally. He's known Morgan ever since he was a little lad. Oh yes, ever since he was as big as... I shouldn't have come here, I know, but I thought he might be here. But he didn't want to defend the divorce. I've only got Morgan, I mean what's he do with his self? Why don't he come to me? I still keep his room for him, you know. Are you all right? I did have a postcard from him in Greece, I mean what is there in Greece? But he does love you, Leonie. You're the only one he ever stuck with. It's quite true, love, the only one. Morgan is sad today. Sadder than yesterday. Man is born to sorrow. Do hurry up, Leonie. I did try with Morgan, I really did try. Yes, I know you did, dear. Will you pop over and see me at the cafe, - if you feel like it, ey? - Yes, I will. - Leonie. - I'm coming. - Bye, Wally. - Tell our love. Bye. Last time I saw that was at the wedding. I always did like Leonie. Yeah. Don't you go making way for them, Wally. They got their car out of the sweat of the workers. Right. Bop, bop, bop, bop. Bop, bop, bop, bop. Morgan. Morgan! What? - Hello. - You told me you were going to stay in Greece until after the divorce. - You agreed that, Morgan. - I got back yesterday. I gave you an enormous check, and you promised. Nothing but ruins, Greece. You got me all excited about going there and it wasn't exciting. I was there and suddenly realized, I ought to be here. Stop you ruining your life. Oh. Insecurity's made you very cunning. I'd say devious if I didn't love you. You said you'd stay away until all of this was over. Until you got me nearly written up by the due legal processes of the state. Now, I've thought it over. I've decided to come back to you. And what'd you mean by having our house torn to bits in my absence? My house. I'm having it converted into flats. I'm going to make thousands out of it. I suppose you think that's funny. Not at all, it means exactly what it says. You're too late, Morgan. Do you realize somebody's been wrecking my studio. I divorced you this afternoon. Oh, how did my image come over in court? Everyone was very sympathetic. I got my decree nearly 20 minutes flat. Is Charles Napier living here now then? You've got to leave me alone, Morgan. Why? Oh, God, damn you blood bones. There were two toothbrushes in the bathroom. And one of them was neither mine nor yours. And when did you start using hair cream? Napier's rubbed his greasy skull on every bloody wall. I can smell him. I went to see a psychiatrist today. If it's more money you want, there's 20 quid in my bag. Who was fat, and extremely furry. Furry hands, furry suit, furry. Will you go away now, Morgan? Please, I want to get undressed and have a bath. What's the matter you come out in horrible spots? It's guilt, can't be modesty, we're still married. Technically. I shall move in, that's what. Boot that greasy art dealer out of our nest. Oh, this is tiresome. Tiresome, is that what you call it? The human soul eviscerated. A life destroyed. Well not my life, my life's quite intact and so could yours be. I didn't think you loved me at all until I said I couldn't go on living with you. Did you know, it's generally agreed there could be no such thing as rape between man and wife. Oh, you kept my duck. We bought that duck in Camden Town. It's a Camden Town duck. Full of water, lost its quack. Are you going to let me get bathed? Go on then, get in, I'm not stopping you. No. Right then, right. Soaking, bloody wet. Right. I'm expecting Charles any minute. Wrong. I shall find my love here. - Morgan, we can't. - Why not? - We're divorced. - I wasn't there. And Charles. Charles Napier is physically lonesome, mentally retarded, and genetically unsound. Morgan. Bath's running. You better get used to the idea. I've definitely come back to yah. I don't want you. I like the old routines. There you are all pink and slippery like a peeled shrimp, always liked you like that. I'm not giving in. No, what was all that in the studio then? Weakness. Well that's nice, weaknesses. - I'm not giving in. - No. But I mean, you love me, I like that. Are you really gonna shack up with greasy then? Are you? 'Cause I like this house. - This is where I live. - Did live. - Did all my best work up there. - Work, the last painting you actually finished was 18 months ago. Besides, I just want you to go away and stay away. But I've no where to go. I live in the car now. My solicitor is writing to you about that, too. - I want my car back. - It's our car. Bought with my money. I did go and see a psychiatrist today. I hope he told you to return my car. Nah, he took me very seriously. Everybody takes you seriously until they get to know you. He said, I'm a very sick man. I don't suppose it makes you any easier to live with. I have fantasies. Nothing new about that. But I act them out. Do you know, I believe my mental condition's extremely illegal. Morgan, what you... What you up to? Morgan, what are you doing? Oh my God. That's a waste of good food. Napier food. I don't care how I get you out of here but I shall. Hello, I want to speak to Mr. Bouve it's urgent. Well go and tell him its his client, Leonie Delt, and I must speak with him. Hello Mr. Bouve, darling, it's Leonie Delt here. Oh, yes, yes it was thank you. The judge was perfectly sweet, well it's urgent, you must help me because when I got home my husband was still here. Yes, he's still here, he's been here all afternoon. I can't get rid of him and I've got someone coming for supper. Well look, you said I could have a court injunction to stop him coming here. Now, this is the sort of thing that's got to be done with complete confidence. Yes, yes, I quite understand that, I couldn't care less... I want the police, yes I want the police. He's wrecking my house, I want police protection. Why not? Well I want that court injunction immediately. Yes, thank you. Goodbye. Morgan? Morgan? Right, this is a stick up. Charles Napier, I cannot allow you to sleep with my wife. I don't like it, it makes me feel funny in the head. Hello, Morgan, back already? I don't think you know Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert. How do you do, I'm gonna blow your oily head off. Oh, I thought you've come to talk business. - Business? - Excuse me. You've had nearly a thousand from me this year and no pictures, it's very naughty and this is merely silly, come have a drink. Geoffrey. I should stake your ribs and plant a boot in your guts. He is a friend of Mr. Napier. How come you didn't stay a little longer? You might've got browned. Really, it's most uncivilized. You can't count on me being civilized, I've lost the thread. I'm afraid you've lost your wife too, Morgan. I'm warning you, I'm getting dangerous. I'm planning to kill you. Pure fantasy. Why don't you get done some work instead? I can't. That's very self-indulgent, Morgan. It was loaded. You got a sort of acid feeling at the back of your throat, haven't you? That's fear. Oh. I wish you wouldn't be so aggressive, it's quite out of character and prevents me from taking you seriously. And where have love got me? Where has gentleness got me? You know, violence has a kind of dignity in a loving man. And I'm full of love. I shall punish you with love. Now where would you like love? In between your eyes or in your teeth? The Gilberts expressed to wish to see you, sir. They said they heard a shot. So they did. Right, I'm coming. Got anymore little toys on you? Good, have another drink. I wish you'd get into the habit of making an appointment. If you brought any pictures leave them with Geoffrey. If not, we have nothing to discuss so you might as well leave my gallery, it's very boring to have you here sulking about Leonie. It's your own damn fault anyway if she's turned to me. She's a very loyal person. Loyal, there's foulness in that woman. I intend to marry her. You're marring her for her money, admit it. Oh, naturally. You don't know Leonie. She married me to achieve insecurity and you're trying to take it away from her, she won't thank you for that. Look, Morgan, it's quite simple. Leonie loves me, we're going to be married. You have to make the necessary adjustments. She's had enough of you. It's my turn. Right, where is he, Charlie, Jack, look in the basement. Spread out. Let's get him. There he is, sir. Over there. There. Gotcha! Out. I definitely meant to bash you. Definitely. Your dad saw himself waving a red flag on the rubble of Buckingham Palace. - Is that all the chips? - Yeah. That was his ambition. - Didn't ey, Wally? - Right. - Did you see him yourself? - Right. Run down by the mounted police at cable street. - I was with him. - In the plant, he was. In the vanguard, a worker with the workers. Yes, look at this... But you, find yourself a rich woman living luxury on your backside. Leonie is my wife, Ma. Your dad was on to you the day he drowned them kittens. You know what had happen to them if you give 'em away, but no, oh no, drowning was cruel you said. Your dad said to me that say after, he says, "You know what you've done, don't you, given birth to a bleeding liberal." When I think of me slaving away in this place here and you. Look at me, fetch us a long fish, our trouble. And those aren't ladies ends. Yeah, what do you mean Leonie's your wife? Why she nearly divorced you, I was with your ma. One of these days, they'll be coming for me with a straight jacket. Oh, you both stop bothering. Ease above it. Oh my bleeding feet. You know what a straight jacket is, don't you, Ma? The whole time, I've been living in one for yous. Oh, boy. Oh my feet are getting red raw. You should give up work altogether, ma. I should come home. I should take a job and let you get a bit of peace, Ma. Oh get on, you could be a famous painter one day, Morgan if you'd only stick to it. Anyway, I only get bored stiff at home. Come on, eat your custard, go on. - Wally. - What? - You're wrestling tonight? - No, why? I want the car around at Leonie's. It was only Monday I drove to the police, arranged it for yah. Got to keep on the move, Wally. I wish you'd learn to drive, Morgan. Yeah, I will. Got to keep on the move. - No exit. - Sorry. - Gorilla. - What... - There's no cause for alarm. - What the bloody hell do you... Gorillas are good, they're big but they're good. Have you got a ticket? Good morning. The time is 6:30, here is George Charlesman with Farming Today. Good morning, let's begin with Market trends and the rates of guaranteed payments for the week beginning June 27th. Steers and heifers, no payment. Pigs, New Castle 164 offered, down 27. Fat sows, frozen. What's all this? It's an island of sanity, this car. An island in a world of pain. I'm in exile waiting for the ice pick. You do know about the ice pick, don't yah? Time, 6:35 on the morning... It's him that got it, Trotsky, right there. Right in the back of his skull. Leon Trotsky. Co-founder of the Russian revolution, creator of the Red Army, great revolutionary thinker. Bingo, right in the top of his match. Joe Stalin kicked Trotsky out of his mother country. 17 years in exile he was. That wasn't good enough for Joe, no. He wanted Trotsky dead. Now then. That's Trotsky. This is the ice pick. A burning up day in Mexico, Stalin's agent has wormed his way into Trotsky's house among his wife and friends. And they're both alone in the great man's study. Trotsky is sitting behind his desk. Quietly the killer creeps up behind him and... I was gonna boil that. You can have have it poached. - Is this your car, sir? - No. Oh, I see. Begged, barrowed, or stolen? Property of wife. You should ask her, she lives here. I'll just note that. But she's out with her lover. Who knows what will happen tomorrow. But I love you, I love you. Oh, I love you, I love... He doesn't like my singing. Very kind, very gracious, very loyal, we're very happy. My love's much deeper than the sea. - Enjoy the ride with me... - I wish that you'd sit down. But while it lasts, I promise you while it lasts, I promise you... You know, what you did before with that shaving brush, that was an assault, technically speaking. Is there anything which isn't an assault, technically speaking? Birth. Work, life. Death. You want to watch it. Yeah, I know. But where is it? Oh, hell. Come on, we're going in. Is here there? Well, I can't see him. We don't have to put up with him camping on your doorstep, you know, you could have him stopped. - I know. - Well then. But I sort of like it. Well I don't. Come on, let's go in. He is there! I'm gonna bash your greasy pate in Napier. Hey! - And he's got his Knobkerrie. - His what? He must've been waiting all night for us, if you want to come in with you, you'll have to fight him, won't you? - Fight him? - Yes and the winner will drag me off and hang me. I'm still waiting to bash your skull in, Napier. Go on, challenge. - What the hell did you... - Oh, dear, I hope you aren't hurt, Morgan. I'm definitely gonna bash you this time, Napier. Is this your wife's bloke then? Yeah and he's got my Knobkerrie. Come back. Oh come on. I'm back. Oh, Morgan, it's no good. - Why? - I can take a lot but once I've made up my mind. I... I'm fairly decisive. You can take the car if you'd like but you must leave me alone. You know I can't drive. Oh, God. - I know what you need. - What? Cup of coffee. Saw me old ma yesterday. Yeah? - And how is she? - She refused to be-Stalinize. I saw her the other day doing her Daily Worker bit in the Finchley Road. Oh, I'm a bad son. Is it the chromosomes, do you think? Or is it England? It's just you. You know, it's nice to have a bit of garden. We ought to fill it with sunflowers. Babies, empty whiskey bottles. Not Napier babies, Delt babies. His lifestyle, haven't you noticed? - Who? - Napier. Sly, cunning, waiting to take over. Got key men in all the best party jobs. Oh, I've know from the start he's been waiting to get you. But I won't go into exile, see? No, one of these days I shall end up with the ice pick in my skull. He'll get all these agents now after me. I shall be hunted down from Wapping to Wimbledon. Do you really think that man can feel sure of you while I'm still alive? No. And what about my babies? Who's gonna have my babies? Do you really want little Napier's growing inside you? Do you? I'm going to marry him. Very peculiar and lonely inside here. Don't think I'm equipped? I'm tired. - I want to go to bed. - With me? Morning, miss. No. - Can we get married now? - No, we can't. Morning... I'm going to get rid of that beastly car for a start. Now do you believe me? That's my bloody car. I'm back. Oh. It may be a car to you, but it's home to me. I'll be back. I'm here, I'm back. Told you I would, now I'm back. And if that's the way you want it, we'll just have to leave violence with violence. Anyone at home? Ello, Morgan, what lovely flowers are they for me? Hello, Morgan, what are them for? Who do you think? You're a good boy, Morgan, underneath. Underneath what, Ma? - You remembered. - Yeah. And it's your afternoon off. - And it's his anniversary. - And I'm taking you down - to the cemetery myself. - Oh, that's nice. That's what your dad always used to Say, "You hang on, you wait and see, it'll all come crashing down and our Morgan will live to see it.” - See what, Ma? - Oh, Morgan, the revolution. Here, I'll take the flowers, you sit down, have a rest. Your dad used to love coming here. You know he wanted to shoot the royal family? Abolish marriage, and put everybody who'd been to public school in a chain gang, yes. He was an idealist, your dad was. Yeah, I remember. I say, read the inscription, Morgan, - it's beautiful. - You know it, Ma. No, read it. "Philosophers have tried to understand the world, our problem, however, is to change it." That's very true, Morgan. Morgan! That's disrespectful. Is it? Sorry, Ma, no offense in that. You have grown into a peculiar sort of a fella, Morgan. Oh, boy. You're not happy are you, son? Not without Leonie. I went to see a psychiatrist yesterday. - Go on, you'd never. - Yup, that's what I need. Specialist in mental troubles. What'd she say? Says I'm a suitable case for treatment. What sort of treatment, electric shock and that? No, you just lie on a couch all day and say whatever comes into your head. Oh, well let's hope he makes a man of you. - Yeah, let's hope so. - Oh, boy. I'll never get any peace in this world. And I don't believe in the next. Ey, you'll never get your foot into that shoe again. - I'm gonna carry you home. - What are you doing? - I'm gonna give you a piggyback. - You're piglet. - Up, oh. - Oh, put that darling down. My lady, up on a fine horse earrings on her finger and bells on her toes. Oh. Up a revolution. Right. All systems a go. But my dear lady, you only have to wait until the artist is dead and your investment is perfectly safe. That's the kind of thing you don't have to explain to his wife, so we have a deal, 3,750... Look at this! It's a hammer and sickle. What is it funny? Why I mean is it? It's just Morgan. Morgan, I'm sick to death of Morgan. Just his way of trying to tell me something. Well, couldn't he send you a postcard? Well, there's one thing we can do. - What's that? - We must move out of here - straight away. - Why? Because Morgan's an infant. Reality is meaningless to him unless it defeats him. You must move in with me. Your mother will be outraged but as soon as the decree absolute comes through we can Satisfier her by getting married immediately. What do you do you say? Charles, oh dear, I'm still not sure. About me or marriage? Both. It isn't easy after Morgan. It wasn't exactly easy with Morgan. I'd appreciate that living with a gifted idiot has its rewards. On the other hand, the function of a nursery in marriage is to be occupied by children. Not by the husband and wife. I was the one who was scared of having children. Yes, because you were afraid that then he'd have to cope with real children instead of being one himself. You'd lose him. Not true? So smug. Poor Morgan. He's going to a psychiatrist. I'm all for that. 'Course it could be a way of blackmailing me. Look, must we discuss him at this point? We've done nothing else, believe me. Oh, Charles. Oh, I'll be fine. I feel so safe. - Darling. - Five, four... three, two, one. Ignition. Go, baby, go! 3,000 feet. We need a little over 200 miles per hour. 700. Approaching the speed of... Where is he? Check the studio. -1,200 miles per hour. He's not up here! I know where he is. Right! Now listen to me, Morgan, if I had any sense at all, I'd call the police this time, but since for reasons, which are quite beyond me, Leonie insists on protecting you, we shall just have to behave as if you don't exist! We're going back to that bedroom, Leonie and I, and we're going to lock the door, and we're going to bed! Go away! I might be sad, but I'm loving! I for life! Growth! I'm fond of flowers. Children, animals! I'll even help out policeman across the road! What more do you want? All very well for you, coming here when you're in trouble. Yes, that's right, take a look. What's new around here, Morgan? Nothing! I've always liked engines, Ma. Oh yes, your Dad liked the railway. He was firing for fifteen years before they even made him engine driver. Russian engines have a red star on the front, Ma. You're a class traitor, Morgan. That's what you are. Them's fighting words. I mean, we brought you up to respect Lenin, Marx. Harry Ponit, he was a fine friend when you were 16, and you was clever. At party meetings, they always used to say to me, "You got an intellectual there, Mrs. Delt." I tell you the middle class has got the brains, you know. It's lads like Morgan who are gonna take this country over one of these days. Yes. Now look at you. I don't think you'll ever take over anything, Morgan. I'm still with you inside my head, Ma. The inside of your head's a flaming mystery to me. Come on, it's ready for you. Get In. You took a little fall with that leg. Come on, it's all right, That's it, that's it. Poo, you aren't very clean, Morgan. I'm not very dirty either, Ma. Pooey, I'm gonna wash this tonight. Well, now you're all tucked up in your own room. I like it here. Nevermind. There's still time. Leonie might change her mind? I'm working on it, Ma. Well, goodnight then. Night, Ma. Sweet dreams. Hello, dream. Yee-haw! Do you love me? Yes! Then do something! And you, put a skirt on! Where are you? I think it's very sensible of Charles to insist on a proper wedding. It's a great improvement on a registry office in Swindon, which is where I believe you were married last time. So, do you like this? No. Has Morgan ceased his marauding? I haven't seen him for ages. Come on. No place for you anymore. I've gotta find you your own mate. He's got rather an enchanting face, my dear. , once met Trotsky during the Great War, and thought him a detestable person. - Oh no! - What? Surely it isn't him! Yes, it is, who else? If he's skulking about this house, I shall send for the police. No, mother, stay here, I'll go and find him. Don't sit down! Morgan, come out! Leonie! Where's Napier? Surely you don't expect to find him in Leonie's bedroom. Just what I do expect. It's an obscene thought, I know, but I do have 'em. It's a mistake to judge others by one's own standards. -Shut up, mother, I'm coming! You got real insight. Will you speak to the police, or shall I? Ma, please leave me with him. I suppose he realizes he can be sent to prison for disobeying a court order. Yeah, yes, yes, he does, Ma. - Silly woman. - Oh how... No, it just came out, I didn't decide to say it. I'll bring your father from downstairs. - Oh, mom, no! - Then deal with him yourself! I have to go, you know. Well it gets cold on Parliament Hill. I'll get frightened. I need music, lights, women. Young women. One of these days they're gonna come and take me away, and you'll wish you had been a bit more human. Oh. You're not much good on your own, are you? I don't know. Heart pumps, kidneys distill, bowels churn. You are funny, Morgan. I'll never have you back, but... I'm glad I had you. I'm glad I was had. I wish you'd understand. I want Charles. Why? Well, I want to live more the way I used to. Yes. But why? Well... cause that's how I am. That's me. I can sense your mother's glittering eye through that keyhole. Since you're both choosing to ignore me, I shall ring the police near here and now! Mrs. Henderson. You are a grotesque, bourgeois lady, and the police will get you nowhere. You must love me, fatten me up with compassion till my pelt ruptures in gratitude. Or I'll blow you sky high. Surely it's possible for someone in his condition to be certified. Come on, over there, come on. Come on, come on. Tick-tock, poor old mom. You are sitting on a bomb. Taylor Henderson here. Get my husband to the phone. Hello? Who's that? I said get him to the phone! What do you mean he's at the office? I suppose you can't be bothered to look for him. What? I don't care if he was a prime minister! Get him! Oh, Ms. Carthwright, thank heaven I've got you. Now listen very carefully. I want you to give a message to Mr. Henderson the moment he comes in. She's awake! My gorilla! Leonie! Leonie! Where is he? Mother, what are you doing? - Are you all right? - Do I look all right? My gorilla! He set the place on fire! Save me, gorilla! And he tried to kill me! What's that? His gorilla. Well it's going out! And it's going out now! Save me, gorilla! Morgan Delt! I'm going to do everything in my power to have you put away! My God, he's got my wife! And she's on fire. Stop! Get after him, quick! Halt, sir, come back! Halt, halt, come back, come back! Get off the floor! Blimey. Hello, Wally. Morgan, what you doing here? Four, five! Six! - Go on. - Seven! - See you later. - Come on, Wally! Come on, Wally! I'm getting past this, mate. Hey, you wanna get back in there. Five, six! - Go on! - Seven! It is kidnapping, you know, whichever way you look at it. Yeah, of course, I know it is. - Well it's illegal. - Yeah. Do you mind? No, do you? No. You know, it's worth a try if it helps you get your missy back, mate. That's what's missing in the law, Morgan. The human element. Your dad and me done a few jobs together once. Nothing big. 'Course it was political with him. "Crime puts the human element back," he says. And he knew what he was talking about. Your misses ain't gonna like it. No. I been born into the wrong species, Wally. That's what it is. If I'd have been planted in the womb of a chimpanzee, none of this would ever have happened. Yes, well you wasn't, was you? No. Come on. I'm with you, Morgan. For he comes down our alley calling at us with his hands in his pockets and his shirt hanging out. You all right in there? - No. - But still she loves him. She can't deny it, she'll go with him. I should think you'll get five years for this. Well you didn't exactly try and get away, did you? It's not real kidnapping. Oh bash us again. Your bashes don't hurt, Bill. Or cause any pain. I'm going to sleep. You caused me a flood, Bill. A flood I'll remain. You bashed us last night, Bill so bash us again. Come on, you two lovebirds. We're here. - Oh, we're here. - For he comes down our alley calling her out. - With his hands in his pockets. - Come and see. And his shirt hanging out. Where are we? Paradise. Didn't he tell you? Do you like it? 'Cause we're gonna live here. Come on, mate, pack it up, it's bedtime. Gotta finish it tonight, Wally. Set sail tomorrow. What are we gonna do here? We're gonna live here, told you. Well I got a booking at Walls End - next Thusday. - You'll be there. It's either that or the nick for us, mate. Wally. What? I don't want to be here. Give him a chance. Don't divide me loyalties, Leonie. It'll only bring on one of my migraines. I'm turning in, goodnight. Do you want to try her now? All right then, if that's the way you want it, oh, we're gonna be here for weeks! Oooh! Oooh! Oooh! Oooh! I know they're coming to get us. This time they may send you to prison. You could stop 'em. I might not. You wouldn't let me go in the neck. Would you? I could marry Charles before you come out. I'm frightened. Nothing in this world seems to live up to my best fantasies. Except you. In addition to the numerous incidents already described, my lord, Mrs. Delt goes on: "On the 13th of April last, Morgan Delt came to my house and insisted that I go away with him. Under duress, and so as not to provoke him to even more extravagant behavior, I unwillingly consented to do so. I tried several times to get away, but was prevented. Now my husband has a friend, Wally Carver, a wrestler, professionally known as 'The Gorilla.' This man drove us to Wales, where we camped for two days. During this time, my husband actively stopped me from telephoning my parents, or anyone else who might have helped me. He seems to refuse to accept that I have been granted a decree myself. "Our marriage is terminated..." Yah! Yah! He-yah! Yah! "I was afraid to be, and I found it intolerable to stay. In the end, I persuaded Wally Carver to telephone my father." Thank you, Mr.. Have you anything to say? Have you anything to say? I don't recognize this court at all. That's hardly relevant. I'm satisfied he has been a flagrant breach of the court injunction. I, therefore, commit you to prison. Is the Tipstaff present? My lord. Come on, you. Ho! Oh, super, thank you so much. Oh yeah, I'll give you a ring when we get back to London. - Leonie! - Harry, hello. See you. Jimmy, been glad to see you. Darling, hello. May I give my humble congratulations, sir? I do hope you'll be very happy. Thank you, Geoffrey, I'm sure we shall. Hello, uncle Chickey. Quiet please, everybody, quiet please! I want you all... I want you all to follow the bride and groom... right downstairs for the speeches, and the cutting of the cake. Charge your glasses, everybody. I'm going to get Mrs. Henderson to make a speech now. I'm now going to ask Charles to guide Leonie's hand in the cutting of the cake! - Here, here! - Woo! Ladies and gentlemen, as my friends know, I am a very shy, inarticulate man. No! In fact, when I asked Leonie to marry me, I was so shy and inarticulate that she had accepted it before I actually got to the question. Roar! And so, before I cut the cake, I would like to express the hope that this will be the first and the last time that I will let the knife pass into the woman's hand. Look out! Guards, do something! Use the chair! Keep him away! Roar! Roar! Get that thing out of here! Morgan! Run away! Come on out, come on. Come on, push him inside! Woo! Out of the way, he's coming down! There he is! There he is! He's on fire! Oh-oh-oh- It's nothing personal about this, sir, of course. But I've come to get you ready. Yeah, of course. This is where it is. I wondered where it was. Arms first, please, sir. That's it, lovely. Oh, not a bad fit, sir, not at all a bad fit. Up, sir, please. That's it. Okay, Charlie, take him away! Rise! Do hurry up, Mr. Delt! Don't hang about. Now, sir, they'll be in a bit of a hurry when they get here. So, if you've got anything to say, I should say it now. Have you got anything to say? Yep. Either I've gone deaf of you're not saying it. Hang on a minute, I can't quite remember. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation, distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all previous ones. All that is solid melts into thin air, all that is holy is profaned, -all that is holy is profaned, -All that is holy is profaned. Man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind. Amen. That was a rare old mouthful, Mr. Delt. Give us a swivel, constable. All right, I think we just got time. Hold on, sir. All right, that's your lot. They'll be wanting to get away for their dinners. Yeah. Get ready to fire! Aim! Fire! I dreamt I was dead. - Did you, mate? - Yeah. I've gone all furry. Those are nice flowers. Yeah, I like flowers. Is that my baby?
