UNDER THE SUN OF RICCIONE I have been car sharing for ten years and you are the most pain-in-the-ass passenger I've ever had. I have to do it a little higher, right? Oh well, I don't have time to let you hear that, I'm late for the audition. You know that this is the biggest opportunity... ...of your life, that if you get in your life will change. You haven't talked about anything else the whole journey. Go, go! Oh well, I have to go. Oh, come on! Come on, come on! Wish me luck. Oh well, whatever. We can split it... Try to make it slow. Sorry. Come on, come on, come on, guys, we can do it. Nice hair. Here I am, Ciro Lamanna. You're late, registrations are already closed. - Look, I come from the deep south. - Yes. Do you know how deep the south is? A lot, it took me seven hours to get here, - I have to enter. - I'm sorry, I can't do anything about it. Ouch. Here it is, here it is. - Damn. Oh, oh my God. - What's wrong? - I don't feel well. - Wait, I'm going to get you some water. Thanks. Yes, I'm coming, bro. No, I'm... This year I'm in a B&B. Well, where are you? At the beach? And who is there? Is Guenda there? No, I'm coming. One minute, I leave my backpack and I'm there. Who the fuck is it? For the rooms. Here we are. Well... Nice house. You like it? This is the first time I rent it, because I can't work, I have the third of the lower fourth of the trapezoid... This way I can make up for it. - See? - And... what do you do? - Are you a fashion photographer? - No, no, I'm a GO lifeguard, guarantee of origin. And these are some of my clients who... Do you recognize that one there? I mean, is it really her? It's her. I was a great playboy, I was the number one in the area. I had them all. I have records, five women in a day without a pit stop. Eating only a couple small bruschettas and things like that, you know? And there? One who didn't succumb to your charm? No, you mean that one? No, it's because the plaster... of the photo is ruined... Let's go see your room, come on. - Here we are. - Oh, knock before you go in, knock. Again with the joints, huh? With all the pussy around here, I say. You're right. - Oh well, this is your roommate. - No, what do you mean "my roommate"? No, no, no, do I have to sleep with him? That is, the agreements were not these. Hey, for 20 Euros, you wanted the Grand Hotel? Uh? - He's right. - Move, come on. - Hi. - Yo. - Marco. - Hi. Yo. Do you smoke? - No. No, no, thanks. - Better. - Mom? - Hm? Why don't we tell everyone you're my sister during these two weeks? Why should we? Uh... Why should someone approach a guy on holiday with his mother? - I want to make friends, you know. - Mm-hm. - Here, this way. - Right. Welcome. He uses talc as deodorant, from the voice he smokes 10-15 cigarettes per day, very thin, bald and short. He is just like that. Like you took a picture of him. Hi, we booked a twin room, name is Marescalchi. No, sorry, a twin room? We said two single rooms. Well, if you want, I have two single rooms for the same price as the twin room. - Deal. - Deal. Oh, it's my mother, fuck. Shut up. Yup? You can't call me every two minutes, otherwise I'll lose my focus and I won't study. Then they flunk me again. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, don't worry. Bye, mom. Bye, bye. Fuck off. Sorry about that, it was that bitch of my mother. They went to Tenerife and said, "You can't come with us this summer because they flunked you for the third time, so you'll stay in Milan." Fuck off! I mean, brother, do you really think I would spend the summer in Milan? No bro, negative. So I booked this place and now we spend the summer together, you and me. - Are you happy, bro? - Oh, yes. You are the best. Why are you here? Well, I... I come here more or less every year. This year I decided at the last second, but... - In short, I ended up here. - Oh, right, fuck. Right. This one or this one? Bro, look, I'm honest, they're both ugly, but you have to go to the beach, what the fuck do you care. I don't know. What the fuck do I care, actually. But why? Let me understand, do you have to fuck someone? Because I can help you, brother. I am your man. Uh, yes, yes, there's... There is a girl I like. I mean, I like her a lot, but... she's been with someone for five years, so... Come on, bro. I mean, you came here for a girl who's in a relationship for five years? You're a fool, bro. I like you a lot. What the fuck do you care. Oh well, I'm going to the beach. Exactly. We are going to the beach, because I want to see it. Let's go. But if you hit on Guenda, I'll get pissed. I won't hit on Guenda, brother. I would never do that. Nice one! - Go, go, go! - Yes, yes! Guenda, take it! Guys, I'll go back to sleep. Why does she do this? Hey, can you give it back to me? Hey, are you deaf? - What? - The ball, can you give it back to me? - Sorry, I didn't... I didn't see. - Eh, me neither. It means we have something in common. - Anyway, nice to meet you, I'm Furio. - Vincenzo. Look, maybe after the game I can offer you a spritz to make up for having made a fool of myself. - Okay. - All right. See you later, then. "See you later," what the fuck am I saying? - Hey. So? How did it go? - Like crap. You're not "fresh" enough, you're not "new" enough. - What the fuck does that mean? - Dude, come on, don't take it personally. Do you know how many "no" Sfera Ebbasta got? He got what? Enough. I have enough. I had also put on my lucky underpants. Hallo. No, no, I'm not the lifeguard. I don't work here. I don't work... How do I explain it in Kraut? - Zwei? - Zwei? Two, I understand, but I don't... I'll take them for you. Two? - I'll put them here. - Ok. Hey! Why are you moving the sunbeds? Look, I'm sorry, I told them I don't work here, but they don't speak a word of Italian, so... Oh, sorry. Are you the new lifeguard? - No. - Too bad. - Listen... Are you interested in a job? - What job? Eh, the mountain guide! We're at the sea, aren't we? The lifeguard! Are you interested? From Monday to Saturday, 250 per week, you start at 6:00. If you need accommodation, there is a room behind where my dummy son Furio sleeps. So, do you accept? Eh, God, I don't know. Am I in? I'm in. Oh, I almost forgot. Can you swim? If I can swim? I dive from ten meters and go twenty meters under water in apnea. - Uh, a dolphin. - More like a tuna. No, no, the team doesn't work. Can I play center-back? Come on Gue, please. Can you explain why you never pass me the ball? And can you explain why you put "like" on that ass picture? Still with that ass? You're pathetic... Guys, guys, take a break. The tournament starts tomorrow. - Hi, guys. - Hello, Marco! - You did it, finally. - Yes, yes. Oh! Phlegm is here. Bro, she called you Phlegm! Yes, but because it seems that I'm not really lively, but it's only because I don't talk too much. - Ah, okay, then. - Marco, how come you are here? Weren't you supposed to stay home this year? Yeah. Yes, but I found a way, in the end. - Oh well, he's... - Tommy! Tommy, bro. Guys, it's an easy name. Hi. - Oh, nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hey, Gue... So, Gue? How are you? Good. I'm great. Does it seem like something's wrong? Everything is alright. No, no, mine was a clich? question. You know, the ones you ask when, I mean, you don't even care about the answer. - Oh. - No, it's not that I don't care, on the contrary. No, I... It was just a question, Guenda, I didn't want to make you nervous... Okay, I'm going. See you later. Bebo broke up with her, she's down. Bebo broke up with her? Sorry, I didn't understand. Bebo broke up with her? Are you talking behind my back? No, no, we... we were putting together the team. Tommy, can you play beach volley? - I can smash. - Great. So Marco plays offense, Furio is the reserve... and we are missing a player. - Hi, my love, how are you? - Him. The new lifeguard. Yes, I'm at work. I know, look... Bebo broke up with her. Period. Can you believe it? They hired me like that, without even thinking about it. So you won't come back? Will you stay there the whole season? Why would I want to come back, Vio? To hear my parents tell me "stop dreaming" and get me to work in the grocery store - to cut the salami? Me? - Oh, well. - Are you sure you won't forget me? - Ciro, come give me a hand! Yes, I'm coming, Rodolfo. My love, it may be strange, but I have to go to work. - It is so. Kisses. Bye. - Ciro! I'm coming, Rodolfo. Furio! There are water crates to move. I can't, I sprained my ankle playing beach volley! I should be a lifeguard here, can you believe it? - Have you felt it? - Mh. A carbonara without cream just passed us by. - A what? - A carbonara without cream. A carbonara without cream? You know that girls are divided into two categories, right? The carbonaras without cream and those with cream. - Mh. - You know that in the carbonara the... - the cream... - It's needed. It's not. Fuck, Vincenzo, there's no cream. That's why the best are those without, right? Less effective in appearance but more authentic in taste. - They are more beautiful. - Dunno. The thing is you are all obsessed with beauty, you know? When actually it is the only thing I don't care about. I mean, I fall in love with the skin, the voice, the smell... - Vincenzo. - Mh? But you, the carbonara... You tasted it, right? No. I never tasted the carbonara you mean. I can't see you, but don't make that face, okay? Look, I'll help you, okay? I'll make you eat the best carbonara of your life. No. No, Furio. Look, never mind. I suck with women. I have an idea. Ok, I downloaded the app, now I'll set up your profile... You still haven't told me which app it is. So, basically is... This is an app that tries to create chemistry between... between people with common interests, even distant ones, to... to fuck. It's to fuck, yes. You give them a like and if they like you back, then you can... Yes, you forgot another detail, though. Ah, you're blond, I didn't write it. Vincenzo, 22, tall, blond... And available for blind dates. It's funny. See, when you want you can do it. - This stuff is funny. - Okay. Anyway, don't worry. I describe you the girls and you say "like" or "go to hell". It's simple, isn't it? Hey, fucking watch your step! So, I was telling you, last night, beer pong tournament. There comes two pros, because nobody has beaten them for months, I win with the first, there's the second one, but by then I had already drank 12 beers and I was totally drunk... I throw, I hit, I win. Now there's my picture up there. Do you want to see it? Yes, why not, maybe after the movie tonight. No, babe, speaking of tonight, I don't... I don't feel like it. I'm still in hangover, I'm tired. I want to rest. Let's do it tomorrow. Tomorrow? But our anniversary is today. Come on, babe, what's one day more? I'll call you later. - Hi. - Hi. So you will stay all summer in my room. Yes, your father wanted it, not me. All right. Let's clarify some things right away. The room is tiny. They are two uncomfortable cots, yours is even more uncomfortable. If the key is in the lock, I'm making carbonara, so don't enter. - Carbonara? - Carbonara. Oh. And does it happen often? Basically never, but I don't give up. Instead, if the door handle is upwards, I'm sleeping. And this happens... all the time. I already feel at home. - Usually he's nicer, you know. - I bet. - He feels his territory invaded. - What the fuck am I, a cocker spaniel? Look, we're missing a player for the beach volley tournament. Do you want to join the team? We noticed your build. But why are you asking him? What were we saying? The winners get tickets for the end of summer concert. The losers run naked all over the beach. It would be nice to see you lose. But maybe, who knows... I'll see you naked anyway. - So, are you with us? - All right. Okay. See you tomorrow. And tonight we're going to a party, you coming? Which party is it? Mom, it's a night at the disco, at Byblos. - But... - No, don't you get upset, calm down. I'll go with Furio and all the others. - With whom? With Furio, with some of my friends. - Your friends? But... - Mom. - Summer, sun, Riccione, friends... - Mm-hm. - I have to make carbonara. - What? Uh? - Come in. Come in. - Thank you. Not you. Fuck. Come on, bro. Bro, there they are. Bro, there's Guenda. Tonight she's yours, bro. Trust me, she's yours. But you have to take this shirt off, because you look like a jerk. - Listen to me. - What the fuck are you saying? Bro, trust me. Okay? No problem. - What an asshole! - What did I do? But no, not you. It is my ex, who posts pictures non-stop with a girl in Ibiza. - But this shirt? - Oh no, it's shit. - They lent it to me, it's not mine. - What? No, I said it's shit. And she's ugly too! Look! He does it to make you jealous, you know? Often lately wars are fought also on social media. You think? Yes. And in fact you should do it too, so maybe he gets pissed. - Wait, look... - Great idea! Nice! Thanks, Marco. You're welcome. Please, boys. No. No, you can't enter. - Why? - There is a dress code. Then, if you didn't notice, the oldest one here is 25 years old. So? It's a public place, open to everyone, I enter. - No. - I want to talk to the owner. The owner is having dinner and if I go bother him because a fifty-year-old... - Fifty who? - ...wants to enter an under 30 party, - it means that I can't do my job well. - What a shitty job. Let's pretend that I didn't hear because the music was too loud. You two, come on. - Come in. Come. - How much do you want to get me in? Let it go. In here there's my son with some strangers, I need to know if he's okay. Look, trust me. Don't bother your son who's with friends and is having fun. My son is blind. He needs assistance. But why do I have to explain it to you? - Just let me in! - Do you want to know if he's okay? - Does he have a phone? Call him. - That's it! What the fuck... - Four years... - Why that voice? Well, because it's not exactly the anniversary I expected. Then, I don't know, lately we're just talking bullshit. - But did you say that thing to him? - What? About the scholarship to go to Canada. No, not yet. He is always with friends, there is never a right time. And I don't know, a year apart... Who is this stalker who sends you 20 messages per second? Luca, Matteo, Francesco, and then there's another one, but I don't remember his name. And when would you have met them? No, I haven't met them yet. - Meaning? Let me see. - Look. - He is cute, like him. - No, Bea, come on. Come on! Look, you talk to him, it's fun, trust me. - I have a boyfriend. - So? He stood you up on your anniversary. And you won't get pregnant for a chat. Well, this one has a slutty face, I'll like her. There's already a match, you can message. Go. No, Fu', but what can I tell her, come on... I mean, I really don't know what to say to a girl I met on an app. - Met on an app? - Hm. They are the best ones you can meet, do you understand? Message her. - Fucking send her a message! - I don't know what to... Okay, okay, I'll send her a message! Okay, okay. "Hi, I'm Vincenzo". Send. - Oh, are you happy? - Hm, was it difficult? - No. - "Hi, I'm Vincenzo. Send." - She has already answered you. - What did she say? "Nice to meet you... Camilla"? But wasn't she called Bea? No! Put me down! Leave me alone, I will sue you! Put me down! What's happening, Fu'? Nothing, they're taking away an old alcoholic lady who... I swear, it sounded like my mother's voice, really. - Why, is your mother an old alcoholic? - No, come on... - Let's go dancing. - Let's go. - Mara? - Hi. Hi. Mara? I think she fell in love tonight, too. - Oh well, drink her shot. - Okay. Hi! - Hey, he's Ciro. - Hi. - Hi. - What are we celebrating? - That thing that ends with "right". - Meaning? - The pussy, right? - Yeah! Here it is, Riccione, it's coming! I can't believe it. Look who she took the photo with. With the lifeguard. I swear, it seems like she's making fun of me. When I want to be noticed, nobody cares about me, and when I want to disappear... everyone notices, always. Unbelievable. Bro, can I tell you something? You are annoying. You are really fucking annoying. I mean, they call you Phlegm? Ask yourself why and then answer. - Bro, changing the subject, do you snore? - Yes. Great. I can't find my earplugs, where the fuck are they? What is this stuff? She took a picture with the lifeguard. What is it? Valentina, Michelle... This one comes from Germany, it's from 1993. This one wrote a love letter to tell him that she had had a great summer. I guess Gualtiero is not full of shit, huh? Go, Gualtiero. Guys, seducing a woman is an art. And I should reveal my secrets to you? Come on. With all the chicks around here, you keep liking the same girl. I understand, if it weren't so I wouldn't be in love. You're out of your mind. She hasn't noticed you for five years and you're still going after her? Come on! Tell him you didn't go on holiday with your friends to be with Guenda, come on. - Do we have to tell him everything? - Yes, bro. You don't need the "pick up guru", that's me. You need a shrink! Look, gramps, spoiler him some moves, so we'll get this thing over with. Spoiler... spoiler... What...? Look, can we leave now? He has been out of the game for a while. The last letter is from '99, let's go. Boy, in 1999 we invented email. - Yes, okay, let's go to the beach. - Let's go. Oh well, come on, I'll help you seduce this Guenda girl. But you clean my house in return. Where is the degreaser? - Hey! - Emma! Ciro! Emma, Emma, you're strangling me. Emma, what are you doing here? They hired me at the Grand Hotel as a waitress, I'll stay here until September. - Cool. - Hey. The game is tomorrow at two. You will be there, right? Yes. She is Emma, my girlfriend's best friend. Ah, so you're my best friend. Mara, nice to meet you. - Emma. - Bye. Bye. She's like that, she's always joking. I'm too happy you're here, so we can go together to parties, to happy hours... Even at the beach I will come here, so, I don't know, can I ask you for... - for the sunbeds? - Yes. - No. - Why not? Oh no, because... because it's full. It's full. Look, the last one, the last one... Was taken by the lady over there. So what about that sign? 30% DISCOUNT FOR SEASONAL SUBSCRIPTIONS What do I know? Maybe... Maybe someone died, they die without warning here. Oh well, where do you want the sunbed, miss? - Sea front? - I wish! - After you. - Thanks. Good morning. A pack of Valerian, thanks. - Right away. - Given the anxiety, I would take two. Oh, hi. - Oh God, but... is that my fault? - Oh yeah. You hit the bullseye. Excuse me, I exaggerated. When it comes to Vincenzo, I lose my mind. Oh, but I'm sure the judge will give you the extenuating circumstances for anxious mothers. Come on, I'm kidding. It's part of my job, it happens. Misfits, boozers... Moms out of their mind... Do you know? I had a mother like that, too. How annoying. Listen, could you charge me with this, too? Dry ice. Thanks. Do you think that 12 euros are enough to make me withdraw the complaint? - Why, did you already do it? - Who can tell? How could you, if you don't even know my name? Right, if you tell me, we'll complete the report. I'm Lucio. Irene. Blondes, brunettes, dark-haired, Americans, mulattos... there is only one method to have them all. - To listen. - Come on! Is this your advice? I listen to them, but they don't fuck with me anyway. Maybe you don't know how to listen well. Those ones over there, for example, look. So, tell me about them. Um... I don't know. Those two have just met, you can see it right away. Do you see she's embarrassed because she hasn't talked to a man alone for so long? She touches her hair, see? She touches them. And him? And he... What the fuck do I know? Let's see if you like it. God! How much garlic did you put in it? I'll kill everyone at the game with this. Why? It is very little. Listen, about the game... I saw that Mara, the one you introduced me to earlier... you two are very close, uh? No, I really mean... a lot. - What do you mean? - You've been here one day, and it seems like you've known each other forever. - I see, Viola told you to check on me. - No. Don't talk BS because I know you. She told me that if there is someone who... who hits on you, I have the license to kill. Nothing else. So you'll have to work a lot, baby. Look at that one, the one dressed in green. Tell me. See, she's a problematic type, she reasons more with this than with this. She makes all her plans and if you mess with them, she flips. Fuck, you know about females, huh? Oh, I'm the chicks' search engine. You click... and I answer. Could you give me my cell phone back? You lent it to me to chat. Yes, but I didn't tell you "flirt with a guy all night long". And from my profile. I didn't flirt with him all night long. We talked. Oh, yes? About what? Because I'm curious to know if you've used dirty talk from my phone. Bro, no dirty talk, we talked about Star Wars. You... Hang on a second. Are you kidding me? This is an app that people download to fuck. You... If you talk about Star Wars, she'll run off. And... Sorry, but did you see Star Wars? Everybody has seen it. Hm. I mean... I figured you wouldn't like it. Oh well, anyway, that's not the point. Camilla is different. I mean, she's smart, she's educated, she's fun... Oh, that's her for sure. Hi. Do you know that the song you recommended to me is really cool? I told her that I have a broken keyboard, so we send each other voice messages. A ge... A fucking genius. You are a genius, Vince'! And you're a smart ass, you've even finished my chips. - Can I ask you a serious question? - Um. Have you ever fallen in love? Me? Four hundred times, at least. Oh, for five minutes... Gualtiero, please. Do you want to tell me that you've never met a woman - who was really worth it? Never? - Sure. Her. Look. But if you've never noticed me... You have to find something that allows you to be with her and show her that you are the man she wants, do you understand? Dunno. I mean, her boyfriend just broke up with her, but... Bingo! She's yours. - Really? - She's yours. In case you change your mind... Even with the old ones? Oh, well... young women can wait, they can die at any moment. All right. Bye, Gualtiero. - See you later. - Bye. Come. Block. What the fuck, Emma. 7-2. - What an embarrassment. - They're kicking our ass, huh? I really don't understand. I mean, he broke up me like that, out of the blue. He turned off his phone, didn't answer for three days... Do you think it's normal? - I can't believe it. - I mean, I know he sounds like an asshole, but it's not like that. Maybe he's... maybe he's just scared. Who does not fear love? It's scary to you, isn't it? You bet it scares me. We've always talked a lot, you know? And he has always been very attentive with me, protective... However, it is as if in the last period something has broken, just like that. But we have a very strong bond, before I left we made love and... and he held me so tight... I can't believe he doesn't want me anymore, really. And nothing, in the end she said to me, "Marco, you are like a brother to me." I mean, a brother, you know? So... Come on, it doesn't seem so bad to me. No, in fact it is a disaster. - Oh well, she friendzoned you, good. - What did she do? Friendzoned. It means that she no longer sees him as a hypothetical boyfriend, but more as a possible playmate, you see? What a desperate case... Anyway, it's still dirty there. Yes, but where did I go wrong? Where did you go wrong? You are too compliant. Do you understand? She must think that she can count on you, but up to a certain point. - Yes, so what? - So tomorrow you go and tell her, - "Listen, Babo..." - Bebo. Bebo, Babo, it's the same. "He broke up with you because you are too spoiled." There you go. He's trolling you. - Yes, of course, I won't tell her that. - What was I doing? Trolling. - "Trolling" is a word used on social media when the intent is to instigate or take the piss. Guys, how the fuck do you two talk? If you want to seduce her, you have to listen to what I tell you. Do you understand? And I'm not "frolling" you! - No, it's trolling, with a T. - Trolling with a T. - Tro. - All right. Tro. Hm. See? You eventually became a lifeguard. Yes, I think it was a mistake, though. Being a lifeguard here in Riccione is an honor. - Oh God, you think? - Many girls come here for this. Yes, but the lifeguard at the end of the day should be awake, but I'm super sleepy. I don't think that's the problem. You have a girlfriend. And how do you know? Bad girls know how to recognize a good guy. Come on, go to sleep. Alone, though. Hey, how are you doing? I'm a bit down... Is everything okay? Can I call you? Yup. "Call Camilla." - Hello? - Hey, Cami. Hi. - Hi. - Um... it's nice to hear your voice. I mean, not just in a message. Oh, are you out? Am I bothering you? No, no, no, I'm... I'm going home. Pass it to me now. Come on, do a forward pass. If you can't play it is not my problem. Enough, you guys, shut up! - But how the fuck do you play? - Bro, pick another game. - Wake up! - I don't like it. I have been a lifeguard for two years and no girl ever noticed me. You are so beautiful that I hate you for how perfect you are. - Don't touch me or I'll hit you. - Just a toke, come on. Furio, enough! I can't stand it anymore! Damn! Every night is the same. Don't you have shit to do? What the fuck! - Oh, concentrate. - Bro! Girls like me! At the age of 13 I decided that I would go to university in Canada, then I waited another ten to be old enough. I even won a scholarship. But now... Now leaving scares you to death. Yeah. Because, in the end, I like it here. Maybe my mother is right. I mean, maybe it doesn't make sense to go. You know that during winter temperatures reach -22 ?F? I didn't know that. But I do know a lot about apprehensive mothers. Why? How's yours like? Um... Let's say she changed. I mean, basically at 14 my father left her and so she doesn't trust anyone anymore. I became the only man in her life. Hey, young man. You can't sleep on the beach. No, I just... Can you lower the light, please? Excuse me. Excuse me, it's my roommate, you see... What are you doing? Is that a fine? - Sure. - But I'm not a car. But... in your opinion... Instead of talking like this, I don't know, I don't know if you'd like it if... if we meet. I think it's the purpose of the app, isn't it? You start by texting and then... you meet. Um, yes, it's true. - But we can also not... - Yes. - Yes, it's okay to talk on the phone, too. - Yup. It's fine, I like it a lot. Can we, I don't know, be... virtual friends? Um... yes, I... I really like virtual friendships. I mean, not that I have so many. But... yes, I like them. Fine. Then we are virtual friends. Um... virtual friends. - Cami, open up! - Fuck. Did something happen? Is everything alright? Yes, don't worry, but my father is back. Talk to you later. Hey. Come with me, get on. I actually told Bea that tonight she could sleep here. I'm sorry. Maybe tomorrow. Of course. - Good night. - Good night. Emma, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but please, where I sleep is a nuthouse. There's always someone, I have to wake up at six, I'm a mess all day... Please, you have to help me. Ciro, how can I help you right now, I was sleeping. I don't... Maybe the next room is free, downstairs... But if there's no one downstairs you can't take the keys. I don't know. But... can I sleep here? - Here where? - Here. - In bed with me? - Eh. Thank you. - You ready? - Go, move! - Come on, good, good. - Go. Come on, be still. I'll go down. Pull your chin up, your chin up. Welcome to Baths 66. The most anticipated event of the year. What are you dressed up as? - I'm a pin-up. - Go, go, go! - You know? I think we're paired together. - You think? Attention, please. Let's make some noise! Come on, put the apple in position, quick, it's about to start. Yes, but you're too tall. I can't get up there. You ready? Don't cheat... - If you laugh, it falls! - Go! Here they are, they are starting. Lower yourself a bit, otherwise my calves hurt and I can't stand on my toes. - Okay... - Good. No, no... - Wait, go slower. Go slow. - If we go slow we lose, Vincenzo. - I guess you are right. - Hey, they started already! - Go. - Come on, I'll get you in my arms. Go! We can see the cheerleader and the Indian getting ahead. Here is the rastaman... Oh! They are thrown off balance. Wait! There's a twist. The pin-up hops aboard. - Aboard whom? - Shut up, you unbalance me! Oh! And they won! Give them an applause! You have to drink it all, now! Drink it all! Drink it all! Drink it all! Drink it all! Oh, well, now you have to drink it all. - What? - Oh, yeah. No! Well done! Come on, another round of applause! Drink it all! Oh. I don't drink! - My head is already spinning. - But at least now you are smiling. Cut it out! - Your mother has picked up a guy. - Really? I know, it's weird. We have never met and we tell each other everything. Oh well, it's a bit like talking to a psychologist. Yes, but at least he answers. Look, but... what does Gio say? Does he know? No. But I'm not doing anything wrong, Bea. I told you, we're virtual friends. And does the psychologist know you have a boyfriend? No. Look, Cami, what's wrong with you? It's four years you don't even notice a hot guy passing by and now you are doing the "froufrou" for a guy you've never even seen? - "Froufrou"? - Yep. - I'm not "froufrou". - No... What the fuck does it mean? Okay, listen. Don't get pissed off. Forget it. - Isn't it a bit too much? - No. What do you say? Can we sit for a couple of minutes? Sorry, but you got together with a woman who doesn't hold her beer. I know, but we're a great couple. A winning one. Hm. It's strange though, because... usually I never win as a couple. - Are you married? - Luckily no, not anymore. You don't know what he told me right before leaving me. "For me this life is too heavy." And he left me alone with Vincenzo. Yes, because I'm heavy. How can you not be heavy when you have to think of everything? I liked to have fun, go out... go dancing, too. You don't know how long it's been since I had a real laugh, you know? Of those that hurt your cheekbones. Do you know? Yes. This afternoon. Fuck, the keys. What are you doing here? You lost the keys, I brought them back to you. Thanks. Thank you very much. You were very nice to bring me back my keys, but... Actually, if you could give me back my shirt, - since it's the only clean one I have... - Why don't you take it off from me? No, no, Mara, really. It's better if you go. Go. - Why, what would you do? - No, I won't do anything, but... Oh well, I'll take it off myself. Ciro! Ouch. Fuck! Yeah? - Are you there? - Yes, um... I was... sleeping. What's up? Violante wants to talk to you. My girlfriend. My girlfriend. - Yes. I'm coming. - Eh. Get there. There is my girlfriend, you have to stay still. - Yup? - Ah, you did it. I've been knocking forever. Bye, Vio. See you later. - Bye, Emma. - Vio! How nice of you to call me now! - Hi, sweetheart! - Hi. I miss you a lot, love. You know, last night I dreamed about you. No, I... I missed myself a lot, too. What is it? Nothing, see? I can move it that way, too. Love, I was telling you that last night I dreamed that we were behind a car and I were doing like this. No, Vio, what are you doing? I take my shirt off. Now it's your turn. No... Vio, what do you want to do? Vio. Love, we won't see each other for three months. We have to cope somehow, right? Vio, what if they see us? But who? Who, Vio? Russian hackers, they are everywhere, they take pictures and then send them on the Internet, it's a mess. - Um, Vio... - My God, Ciro... My God. Listen, Viola, I have to go. I have to go to work, okay? Oh, well. We'll continue tonight. You call me, love. Bye. Bye. What the fuck are you doing? Yes? Ciro, I'm sorry. Can you give me my phone charger? Yup! So, get in... Get in there. Here it is. - Why are you crying? - Nothing... - I messed up at work. - Oh, okay. Do you want to take a walk with me? - Now? - Yeah. - Actually, I had to... - Are you busy? No, um... No. My tray gets off balance and bam! It ends up all over him. What an embarrassment. Even because, you know, at that point in the movies he looks at you, love sparks... No, nothing. He got super pissed off, he was screaming in Swedish, everyone was watching, - so the head waiter arrived as well. - What did he say to you? I don't know, he is from Bergamo and I didn't understand a word, but obviously he was pissed off. Yes, but eating fish-fry is not the best solution. What should I do, Ciro? At work I risk being fired after a week, it's a miracle if a boy notices me and when they do, I throw mussels all over them. I... Sometimes I really think I'm a very bad sub-sub-brand of Bridget... Sorry. Oh well, at least we have wine. I don't know, Emma. I came here to sing and I find myself moving sunbeds and umbrellas all day. And me? I have top grades in university, but I always look like a fool because I can't carry two plates at the same time. Why do you want to be a singer? I don't know, I've always wanted to do it. Yes, but why? I don't know. The truth is that maybe... I always wanted to be a singer more than sing. I imagined stadiums full of people shouting your name, photos, autographs, groupies... Instead it takes discipline, talent. You have work your ass off. And I don't know if I want to. Anyway, I too don't know what I want to do. I mean, I don't know if I want to continue with university. Oh, come on, you're a nerd! I'm not a nerd! It's just that I have a good memory, but... I don't know if I want to change faculty or if I want to change city. Anyway, Riccione is really beautiful. I'll tell it to Violante! Sorry! What the fuck... - I got hurt. - Are you hurt? Here. Yes. Look here. No! What an asshole! It's disgusting! Come on! Are you breathing? I scared you, huh? Come on, let's go to sleep. - Look. - What's up? Bebo looked at the story I posted the other night. Marco, your plan to make him jealous worked, look! I'm going to make others, thanks. Guenda! Bebo was right to break up with you. - Why? - Because you're a spoiled brat, Guenda. Why, for what reason? What did I do? For what reason, you know... It is obvious, Guenda, you're always on social media tweeting, counting likes... You've become a person who thinks only about herself. Fuck you, Marco! Guenda, I didn't want to tell you! They threatened me, Guenda! Bro, you came out of the friendzone. Shut up, okay? Please. Stop for a moment. You're probably better without these, right? With, you're better with them. With these she'll notice you for sure. Who has to notice me? Camilla. Isn't she at the palms? No, look, I won't go to the palms even if you drag me, I tell you. Well, then I don't have to drag you too much, because we're already here. What do you mean "we are already here"? Give me the phone, I need to see the picture. But you're an asshole, come on! Oh, there she is. Fuck. - Come. - Slowly. Hey. Hi. Have we met before? Don't you recognize him? - No. - There you go. Can we leave, please? Come on, don't play hard to get, you've been texting for days. Ah! Oh God, I can't believe it, are you the psychologist? - No. - The psychologist? No, but her voice is not like that. It is softer. It's like every word has a laugh in it, you know? You know, those contagious laughs that you burst out laughing even though there is nothing to laugh about. Or when you hear music for the first time. You feel that it fills the room and then you realize that it has filled you too. You know, I would recognize that voice immediately. Hey. What's up? Did I say something wrong? No. You didn't say anything wrong. - It's you. - Yes. Sorry if I didn't tell you before, I just didn't want to ruin everything. Oh. Oh well, but... I really don't care. Look... I don't know, would you like to have something at the bar? So you're telling me you used the app from your friend's phone. Yes, right. So you're not blonde with fuchsia ends. No, I'm redhead with dark eyes. Well, I'm nothing special, I don't think you'd ever notice me. No, I would. Because you have a very good scent. Can I touch your face? Sure. You are exactly as I imagined you. Anyway... I'm single too, you know? If you are interested... She's not interested. - So only mussels today? - Yeah. Exactly. Hey. - Hey, Vincenzo, love. - Hey. Uh, mom, don't wait for me tonight. I'll be late. But... did you change shampoo? - Did you go to the hairdresser? - No. I bet you did. There's nothing wrong with that. But admit that you like him. - Who? - Who? The bodyguard, you know? Even my friends saw you with him. - All right, bye. - Bye. Oh, come on, you're even wearing your silk dress? What are we talking about? - Bye, come on, go. Bye, love. - Yes, bye. Look, what if I invite you to dinner tonight? - What if I tell you no? - Oh well, I'll ask someone else. No, put me down! Come on, put your helmet on. Just like that? No, I've always worked in nightclubs. But before being a bouncer, I worked inside. - Bartender? - No! - Stripper. - Really? Of course. I used to dance on the pole. Are you crazy? - Come on, I'm joking. - Thank goodness. My cheekbones hurt. No, I studied Law for two years, but it was a deadly bore, it wasn't for me. So I started working nights. - What's up? - Nothing. - Come on! - Stop, we'll end up in the water! Let's dive. - But it's dangerous. - No, come on, let's dive. But it's dark! I live in the dark. Come on, let's go! I found a towel. How cold! Yes. Did I mention that they are the best of the Riviera? Vincenzo is not picking up, and the tracking is disabled. Tracking? Yes, this way I know where he is if he gets lost. Come on, Irene, don't worry, if he needs you, he'll call you. Come on, taste them. No, I don't want it anymore. I'm... I'm too shaken. You eat it for me. Irene, wait. You are a wonderful mother, but every now and then... you forget you are also a woman. If your child needs you, you have to forget about a lot of things. Yes, of course, you're right, but... You can't forget to be happy. Mom? Mom? Is that you? Anyway, I saw that Camilla girl on the beach with another guy. - Does Vinz know? - No, I don't think so. Then we have to tell him, guys. - How the fuck do you eat? - Shut up, he's coming. Hey, Vi'. - Come, sit down. - Um, no, I can't, I have to see Camilla. Right, speaking of Camilla... There is something you should know about... No. Stop right there. I don't care if she has an ugly nose or a flaccid ass, I don't care. Also because maybe it's the first time I've fallen in love and I've never been so happy. What did you have to tell me? Tell him. That... that... Never mind. Nothing important, just... Nothing important. - See you later, then. - Alright. - Great. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye. Nice guy. What could I do? He leaves in a week, he is happy, at least he enjoys it. Okay, here's the team. Marco serves, Emma defends, you two on the sides, - and I try not to let it fall. - What about me? - Reserve. - Okay, hands here. Perfect. Come on, guys. One, two, three, go! The semifinal is about to start. Bath 66 against Playa del Sol. Go, go, go! Come on, come on! No! Mara serves, the opponent responds, - the ball goes out. Our point! - Yes! We are 20 to 21, we need one more point. Hey, I'm sorry. Um... tonight there's the happy hour at the Flamingo and I was wondering if you would like to come with me. No, look, I'm sorry, but you look just like that asshole of my ex. - So? - Too many bad memories. I'm going crazy! I don't know what to do. Do you understand? I don't know. What the fuck are you doing? No, tell me, because you're being ridiculous. Ok, the game with Guenda is not over yet, so tell me what you are doing. What game? I'm playing alone here. She didn't notice me before and she's not doing it now. It's her. Answer, put it on speaker. Yeah. Yeah. - Hello? - Hi, Marco. Can we meet? Yes, sure. Right now? I thought about what you told me. - You were right. - Really? Yes. I'm sorry if I reacted like that in the beginning, but... I'm not used to honest people like you. I made a lot of mistakes with him. I demanded too much, I was... I was spoiled, like you said. So I sent him a message apologizing... and he replied that he wants to try again! Thanks Marco, it's all thanks to you. It's a pleasure. How are you? Hm? Love, you know, they told me here in the hotel that tonight there's the sardine festival, why don't we go? If it stops raining, otherwise... No mom, I'm going out with my girlfriend tonight. Oh. And since when do you have a girlfriend? That's why you turned off the tracking. No. But I can't believe you still use it, where am I, under house arrest? Yes, but who is she? What if she's a crook? What if she is teasing you? What if she has any illnesses? - No, I want to meet her. - I hope you're kidding. No, love, a guy like you must be careful. A guy like me? Why? What kind of guy am I? A handicapped? No, come on, Vincenzo, don't say that. If I want to go out with a girl I will, without your full check-up. But... I have to protect you. I know it annoys you, love, but you need me. No, you are the one who needs me, I'm 20 and you still treat me like a child. Mom, you've already done your part, you've actually done two, because you've done that of Dad too and you've been wonderful. But that's enough. You must live your life. Your life is my life. I'm sorry, I can't help it. I'm going to say hi to Vincenzo. Will you cover for me tonight, too? No, Cami, that's enough. You can't keep lying to Giorgio and stay with the psychologist all the time. Bea, I don't know what to do. Ok, with Giorgio, we grew up together, but when I'm with Vinz... I don't know, it's different. Please, I swear to you that tomorrow I'll talk to both of them. - You promise? - I promise. Alright. - Are you ready? - Go, go. Ouch. So? Truth or Dare? Um... Dare. Give a kiss to... - Furio. - No. Yes! - No, negative. - Come on! No, guys, not Tommy! Come on, a small kiss. - Come on! - Do it! Come on bro, it's a dare. Quick. No, bro! No, no! Not with the tongue! - No! - Just a bit... Hey. - Hi. - Hey. Wait. Come closer. - Can I do something? - Yes. Would you like to see the world the way I see it? Bro. Yes, yes, yes! Truth or Dare? - Truth. - Truth... Are you in love, bro? - Tough, huh? - So, bro? - Yes, I'm in love. - Who are you in love with, bro? With whom? Um... yes, I... I love... - summer. - Go to hell! - Marcolino, come on! - Oh, I love summer. - No! - I know, but... - Come on... - Blah. Why not? What the fuck are you doing? Gio. Wait. Wait up! - Hey! Let me explain. - Explain what? You tell me you're home with Bea and you're kissing a guy on the beach instead? - No, Gio, please, I swear... - How many lies did you tell me? I swear. Wait up! Let me fucking explain... Hey. Hey. Hello. How are you? If you're looking for your son, he's not here, it's early. No. No, I wanted to apologize for the other night. I was bad-mannered. Okay, apologies accepted. Forgive me, but I have to work. Incoming call from Camilla. Incoming call from Camilla. I messed up, Vince'... You're in good company, Mom. I guess I still haven't understood anything about love. But in my opinion... if you're afraid of losing, you won't play well. Hey. What are you doing here? What about you? I mean... what's wrong with me? I go out with a nice guy, we talk about nice things all night long, then I go to the toilet, and when I get back I find him talking to another girl. I know, I may not be Scarlett Johan... What are you doing? Sorry. Do you want to know why... he started talking to someone else? Because I talked about you all evening. - Do you know why I don't pay here? - Let's hear it. Because I brought them all the most beautiful women of the Riviera. Actresses, singers, models, beautiful... Even a Miss. What is the name of that Miss...? - Gorgeous, a goddess. - And you fucked her. Well, I'm a gentleman, I don't say these things. With her I used the despair method. I said to her I was going to die, and she gave me this last gift. You should use this method with Guenda. You know, I can't stand your bullshit anymore. Have you ever done something impulsive in your life, just because you wanted to? If Guenda doesn't want you it's not my fault, you know? Do you eat the prawn? Look, you never paid here, but you never enjoyed a meal, and you know why? Because you always thought about what would happen next, about the fact that a girl was no different than the next one. You don't fucking care if you have the woman of your life in front of you. I know, but if you cancel the reservation I can't give you your money back. Emma, what are you doing? Violante is my best friend. So you were going to leave without telling me? We fucked up, Ciro. It's better to end it here. Wait up. You can't pretend that last night... I was drunk last night. I don't remember anything. And it is better if you forget it too. Take this! Scopa. Hi, Vi'. Camilla has a boyfriend. Did you know? So? Yes, I knew it. But... You were happy, I didn't want to ruin everything. Look, I fucked up. Yes, you fucked up, but now is worse. Thank you for everything, Fu'. Thank you very much. Sorry, do you know where the lifeguard is? - Yes, he's over there. - Thank you. Hey! Vio. My love. - Oh well, I leave you to it. - No, come here, let's hug. We'll catch up later. - Okay. - Bye. - Vio! What are you doing here? - Sweetie! - Surprise! Aren't you happy? - Of course I'm happy! - How long will you stay? - A week. - Oh. - Ciro, I've missed you so much. Come on, take the day off. Let's go to your B&B. No, no, Vio. I can't. - You can't? - No, I have the beach volley final. The final is starting! I remind you that the winners will get the tickets for the concert and the losers will run naked! Come on, my love! - Where the fuck is Emma? - I think she's not coming. You play. - Me? - Yes, Furio, you see anybody else? Play. - Come on! - Me. - I'm fucking playing. I'm playing. - Come on! - I'm fucking playing! - Come on, come on! Come on, come on, come on! Go, go! No! No, come on! No, I know you. You want to appease me for when I come back to Milan, but in the meantime you're fooling around in Ibiza? How does it work? I... Oh, you're in Milan? You really think so? I've missed you so much, too. Pass it! Yes! Ouch! Go! Guys, these are yours. We are the best, guys! Anyway, I'm going back to Milan, I'll take the nine o'clock train. What? You go back to Milan? To see Bebo? - Come on Gue', you know he's a douchebag. - Yes, I know. But I can't stand being miserable here anymore. But you were even more miserable with him. I mean, you were fighting every day. I know that you are sad, but... Maybe there's a reason why it's over. Well, I've already got the tickets. I'll go pack. Fanny. By the time I realized she was the woman of my life, it was too late. I thought it was a waste being with just one girl when... I could have a different one every day. I was sure that I kept thinking about her because she was the most beautiful. I had no idea I was in love with her. Well, it was so long ago, it's ancient history. But if you are still thinking about her, it means you're not over her yet. - It's been 30 years. - It doesn't matter. That's why it's incredible. Years go by, but... she's always there. I just didn't have the guts to realize it. And you may be a loser, but you are way braver than I am. You know? Emma! Emma, I know you are avoiding me, and I even know why. - Viola, I... - Shut up and answer me. Ciro has another girl, am I right? Just tell me one thing... is it Mara? No... No, there is no one else. Fanny Beaumont, bro, it's her! It's her. Oh, she left him, bro. Yeah, she was in a relationship, so she went back to her boyfriend in France. Yes, but maybe it's not her, maybe it's another Fanny, I mean... Now we'll find out. So... Go. So, this is not her. Not this one. I'll contact this one later. She's hot, you know? Not this one, no, no... - Yes. Yes. - There she is. Yes. It's her. - Look how beautiful she is. - It's her, bro. Gualtiero is not stupid, huh? - Hello. - Thanks. - Hey, who are you looking for? - Nobody. Sorry! Is there the possibility to go backstage? - Let's go, come on. - Thank you. Vio! Vio, what are you doing? Look, Ciro, you're not ready for a serious relationship. You want something different. And maybe I want it, too. No, come on, I too want to go backstage. What is this? No! - Tommy! Please, eh? - No fucking way. Anyway, bro, I would have done the same. I mean, I wouldn't have told you anything. So you're not pissed at me anymore? No. Not anymore. It's just that I imagined a lot of stuff and now I feel like a jerk. Well, this is classic. Do you know how is it called? This is carbonara indigestion. Yes. What do you think I have to do now? I mean, because she... I don't know, she told me a lot of bullshit, but tomorrow I leave and I won't see her anymore. Call her. I've thrown the phone with her number in the sea. What did you do? What did you think it was, the sofa? - You're a jerk. - Come on, let's go find her. - Let's go. - Hello, Vincenzo. Who was it? He's your mother's man, he's working security here, for the concert. Really? Can you do me a favor, then? Mom! I'm calling you from a stranger's phone, I'm at the concert, I'm lost and I need you. Please come here! - Let's go. - What a jerk... Bro! I have the pass! I have a pass, bro. Let's go. What? Bro, I said you were about to die, so they took pity on you and let us pass. - Here we go. - Are you crazy? Don't bust my balls! We have a pass! It's good, bro! Let's go, come on. Give me your hand. No, no, over there. - There she is. - Is she here? There is Bea, too. She's with her boyfriend, fuck, I don't know if it's appropriate to show up here. No. What can we do? Write her a letter, you know? Like old times. You speak, I write. I don't care that the concert is sold out. Just let me in. Security, we have a problem at entrance number two. Why do you call security? I'm telling you I have a problem, let me in! - If you don't want... - Irene. - Lucio. - Don't worry, I know her. Look, Vincenzo called me, he was in a panic, he's lost. I have to find him. Really? I saw him leave with Furio. He seemed okay. What? You've seen him leave with Furio? - Sure. - So why... Why did he make me come here, then? I can't believe it. I guess this time he was the one who took care of us. No. - What do we get? - It's for you. It's urgent. Done. Who was that? Hm? No one. He was a... PR man, he was advertising a club. Can you take me back to the hotel? Come on, bro, you can't miss the concert, it's your last night here. I don't feel like celebrating, tonight. I don't know why I'm writing to you, you know I've never had a girlfriend, you were my fisrt one. But you just lied to me, you hurt me. I should hate you now, but I can't. You gave me the best moments of my life and I love you anyway. Vincenzo. Have you seen that girl? She's hot! BYE MARCO, I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SAY GOODBYE... I'M GOING BACK TO MILAN, SEE YOU NEXT YEAR! She's leaving. BYE GUENDA No, it's dumb... Bro, she is leaving, see what do you want to do. Hm? That's enough, come on. Where the fuck are you going? Thank you! Isn't Emma coming? She has a double shift in the hotel not to see you. Good evening! How are you? Great! - Are you having fun? - Yeah! Today... Today, for the first time, they told me that I am brave. They also told me that I'm a bit of a loser, but I knew this, so... I focused on the first part. They told me that I am brave because I fell in love. Because I wasn't afraid of this huge, giant thing, which in short... ruins your life. But that makes you do incredible things like the one I'm doing now. So Guenda, it's true. I'm a loser because I've loved you for five years and I've never had the guts to tell you. But I'm also brave, and so I'll tell you here, in front of everyone. Doing what I do best... which is make a fool of myself. - Thank you. - Bravo! Wonderful! You're the man. Please, don't say anything, okay? - My man! - Bro! They told me that I am brave because I fell in love. Because I wasn't afraid of this huge, giant thing, which in short... ruins your life. But that makes you do incredible things like the one I'm doing now. So Guenda, it's true. I'm a loser because I've loved you for five years and I've never had the guts to tell you. But I'm also brave, and so I'll tell you here, in front of everyone. Doing what I do best... and you know it, which is make a fool of myself. Thank you. Louder! Sorry. Can I...? Gracias! We broke up. Hello? Hello? Fanny! Fanny... Listen... anyway... with Gio it's over. It was over months ago between us. I swear, but when you are together since high school... I don't know, it's hard to break up. And I also wanted to tell you that... I'm not leaving for Canada anymore. Look, Cami... Until a few days ago I had no idea what love was, I'd never dated a girl and I'd always just imagined all of these things. But now, thanks to you, I've understood them. But? But you have to go. I mean, this is your dream since you were 13 and I know it's far away, I know it's scary, but you have to go. And I'm telling you even though being with you is the thing I'd want the most. But do you promise that next summer we will meet here again? I promise. - You have to learn how to toke. - Loser. Giovanni! Look at this... - Bea! - Cami, come here! Hey, Vinz! Guys, you have to promise. Next year, you all come back here! - Yeah! - It's never gonna happen. - Whatever, though, didn't we have fun? - Yeah! No, sorry, I can't do it. You remind me too much of my father. Listen, I'm tired of this. Let me see a picture of your father. Okay. There's a slight resemblance... But how the fuck is it possible? Why are they running naked? Because they lost in the tournament!
