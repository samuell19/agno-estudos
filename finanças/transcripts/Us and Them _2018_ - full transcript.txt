Do you need a hand? Move in further. Come. Come over here. All right. You need to buy a ticket. Is there no discount? Don't block my way. Have you found it yet? Just pay for the ticket. -Stop wasting my time. -Can you check the others first? -I will show you my ticket once I find it. -No. Just give me a second. I know, you won't find it. I've seen plenty of people who act like they have lost their ticket. Just buy the ticket from me at its original price or the officer will show up and issue you a fine. I still have to find my ticket regardless of who will show up. -I bought the ticket. -Let me find it. -Come to the eighth coach. -Roger that. -You-- -Miss! This ticket belongs to you, right? I've boarded the plane. I can deliver the signed contract on time. It's all good. Hello, sir. Welcome aboard. Hello, ma'am. Please fasten your seatbelt. Thank you. Here. Look at this. I bought the ticket. I really did. Are you from Yaojiang, too? -Could you help pass the noodle? -The three of us are from Yaojiang. -Thank you. -We haven't seen you before. I have been out of town for years. You all look like college students. The intellectual kind of students. How old are you? I'm 69 years old. You look like you're 16. I'm 22 years old, but I look younger. Pass the noodle. Pass the noodle. -Hold on a second. -I can teach you. Let me see. My goodness. You don't have it. A pair of Threes. Who drank the soup of my noodle? He did. The one wearing glasses. -Shit! It's none of my business. -I didn't drink any of it. You guys did. -The one wearing glasses. -Don't move! You fatso! How did you get this scar? I fell when I was drunk. It looks cool, right? Isn't it cool? It is. Ladies and gentlemen. We regret to inform you that due to the weather -we are not able to travel any further. -For how long? We truly apologize for any inconveniences caused. Hey, Qing, are you really going? I hate New Years. Traveling back home every year is always a disaster. The train is always crowded. Either I have to hold in my pee or I just can't drink anything at all. I think Beijing is pretty nice. Hey! At least I can focus on designing my game. But there's one problem. When it rains or snows, the traffic would get so congested. That's right. Once, I had to work late and the storm was pretty bad. I lived at Fifth Ring Road. I had to walk from the Third Ring road because I couldn't get a cab. I was so desperate. But I met a guy who was willing to give me a lift. You accepted a ride from a stranger at midnight? I was miserable. I would've accepted the ride even if the driver were a ghost. And then what happened? The driver is now my ex-boyfriend. -What? -Yeah. Wow. You can drink really well. -Here. -What for? After all, we've survived this snowstorm together. Hold this. -You are quite romantic. -Just take it. -Come on. -Okay. What's the purpose of this? -It's for you to hold on to. -Okay. Let's head back. -You should escort her. -Okay. -Hold on. -Let's go. Finally, we are almost there. I feel like I'm about to turn into a popsicle. We have been informed by the Captain that due to the weather in Beijing, all flights for today have been canceled. Please prepare to disembark the plane soon, Please do not forget your belongings. Let's walk together. Business class passengers, please come forward. -Business class passengers. -Here. Room 521. Can you give us two separate rooms? But you only have one ticket. But there are two of us here. Are you friends? Do you even know each other? Economy class passengers can line up over here. We will try our best to accommodate you. Thank you. Maybe I can go to the lobby and see if there is a couch that I can make do for a night. Are you afraid of me harassing you? I'm afraid that I would harass you. You can get some sleep. I'm not sleepy. It's been a while. Every time... Something bad is bound to happen whenever we meet during New Year. Is that so? Well... We used to rush back home for New Year. And now, we are rushing to Beijing for New Year. Does Beijing make you feel like home? Hey, Xiao-xiao. Didn't your mom come with you? She's oversea, taking care of her pregnancy. She found herself a foreign husband. -Happy New Year! -When will you marry and have a baby? -I already have three kids. -Xiao-xiao. -Happy New Year! -Xiao-xiao. I called you two days ago to change the gas pipe. -I couldn't reach you. -I changed my number. Xiao-xiao, you're back. Give me your address in Beijing. -I'm getting married. -Okay. Xiao-xiao, you're back. -Happy New Year! -Happy New Year! Happy New Year. -Hello, Mom. -Where are you? -I just got home. -Did you get the stuff? When will you have a formal address in Beijing? It's troublesome to send you stuff without an address. No, I'm not home for chocolates. I'm here to see Dad. The New Year feast will be ready soon. I'm starving. It's the same dish every year. There's nothing new. Where are the sticky bean buns? It won't feel like New Year without it. I always prepare them. Your high school teacher came over for dinner the other day. He mentioned that his daughter is in the same grade as you. She is now studying in Beijing. -University of Political Science and Law. -That's too far. I don't want to have a long-distance relationship. It's only in Changping. Is it really that far? It's too far for me. How about the one that your uncle introduced to you? Stop worrying about me. -You should worry about yourself. -What are you talking about? I'm telling you. You better come back here once you have graduated. There is no career in making video games. A SPRING FILLED WITH HAPPINESS A YEAR FULL OF PROSPERITY It's not working. I couldn't light this one. Yes, it went off. One more. This one works. Are those shoes comfortable? Not really, but the comfortable ones are so ugly. Goodness. You need to clear the snow off your porch. -You do it. -What? -Hi, sir. -Hey. That's my dad. -Have you eaten? -Yes, I have. You can always have more food on New Year's Eve. GOOD FORTUNE This is Lin's best dish. Here. -This year, I've missed his cooking. -Have some first. This is the only picture I had with my mom. -Where are you? -In her belly. -Cheers. -Come on. My wife went to Canada before New Year. I stayed home all by myself. My daughter got married to a man from Chongqing. She won't be back until the second day of the New Year. Xiao-xiao. How long have you been with Jian-qing? -She is not my girlfriend. -What? Xiao-xiao. We've all been there. I just don't want you wasting time, especially when it comes to finding your other half. You need to check their backgrounds, their origins, and even trace their ancestry. Especially-- Let me finish. I'm still talking. Don't interrupt me. If I have nowhere else to go the next New Year's Eve, -I will come here and drink with you all. -That's great! Great! You should come every year. Your dad is a great cook. I haven't had a good time during New Year for a long time. There's no one at your place. Why did you go through all the trouble of coming back? I'm just finding a reason to spend time at home during New Year. My mom would not come back. If I didn't come back, my dad would be left alone. You know, you are not like most girls that I usually meet. You curse people. You know how to play cards and you drink well. What else do I not know? Actually, there's quite a lot that you still don't know. I told you that it'd be hard for you to walk in these shoes. Hey, let me help you. Our neighborhood... hasn't changed much after all these years. It's like time has stopped. Sometimes, I would think of my dad... because when my mom was pregnant with me, my dad came back to keep her company. So as a kid, I would always say to myself, I will definitely get out of here when I grow up and I'll go on my own path. People say that, in Beijing, five years is enough for you to walk your own path. How long have you stayed there? Does four years in college count? Of course not. So that means I haven't started. Do you like Beijing? I think I'm not going to make it. Nothing has really changed since I first arrived four years ago. Come on. There is only one year left for you. Aren't you afraid that you'll regret it later? If I had stayed for another year, I would have made it. -Is that so? -Yes. -That's what I thought too. -Hang in there. It's a new year. I want to get a better job. The first wish I have this year is to marry a local guy in Beijing. I will make it and come back home with honor. You silly! Why go back home if you've made it? Just stay in Beijing. You're so silly! Living in Beijing has always been a dream of mine. There's always something new here, someone interesting, and all of your dreams can be fulfilled here. Even though the salary might not be much, and the air and water are not as clean as in our home, I have to at least try. Or I won't be willing to return to a small city, to marry someone, have a family, -Put it on my tab. -and live an ordinary life. -I have to hang in there. -Come in and take a look! Bring it on, Beijing! Who would want to leave Beijing after graduation? Every time when I pass by Tiananmen, I think about all the wonderful things that could happen here. I know that Beijing is not my hometown. I would rather embrace the fact that I might fail in life. I wouldn't want to give up the chance to go all in. They say that the life here is hard, but I'm not afraid. At least I've been to Beijing and have lived here. A day in Beijing is really short. It seems like the day ends even before it begins. Every day when I wake up, I feel like my dream is turning into reality. Is this seat taken? Hi. Here are your cutleries. Let me introduce him. He is my boyfriend. His name is Yi-long Sun. He has a PhD in Law. He just got into the Institute of Geology, Earthquake Administration. PhD? Your job is to dig like a groundhog in that bureau, isn't it? What do you mean by that? Well... -You're a handsome groundhog. -Just ignore them. Actually, my boyfriend is not that special. He is just a small-time government officer. He's managing the distribution of houses. The house we bought is around 4,000 to 5,000 RMB per square meter. It's not a big deal. What do you mean by that? Only 4,000 to 5,000 RMB? Do you even have that much? Do you have it? Stop being sarcastic. Come on. -Let's finish our drinks. -You drink like a man. My mom said girls shouldn't drink so much. It's bad for your health. I can do it. Let me. Congratulations. Xiao-xiao, you are becoming a Beijing local. Cheers. How did you know each other? From the internet. We're virtual friends. Isn't it cool? Is it safe? How old is he? He's 27. -He's 27? -Yes. He could pass for your dad. What's wrong with you? You just don't get it. That's because I look much younger. Does he treat you well? Of course! How exactly does he treat you? Picking stars for you from the sky? Bringing pearls to you from the ocean? Stars? Pearls? What? I mean, would he do anything for you and give you anything you want? We are in the computer business. How can we work without electricity? Young man. Have some sense in you. How will you make it if your brain is useless? -What did you say? -Hey. -What are you doing? -You better watch out! Sheng. Xiao-xiao. -Hey. -You look great today. You've got a date? I'm meeting my boyfriend's parents. Sheng, these people are from my hometown. It's hard to make a living here in Beijing. Please help them if you can. -Sure. -Is it okay? Thanks to Xiao-xiao, I will arrange it in the afternoon. Sheng, let's have drinks together. -Sure. See you! -Okay. Your shoes are really pretty. That was great. Now you know the power of these shoes. It's okay to be short. You should be more confident. I'm not wearing them for you. Well, look at you two fighting. Do you have feelings for her? Hey. Boys. I need to tell you something. My parents called me the other day. They got me a job as one of the officials in the county. I have to leave tomorrow The familiar places and you -My tears came flowing down -My tears came flowing down -Because of our separation -Because of our separation Hello? I will remember your face Calm down. I will be right there. -I will -Okay. Cherish how you longed for me -I will keep -Wen, I'm heading out. -Those days -Keep him company, okay? -In my heart -Go. Until forever What is in this? It's so heavy. My shoes. These are all my things. FORTUNE, WEALTH, AND HAPPINESS Goodness. This room has everything. You can turn on the fan if it gets hot. Why don't you ask me what happened? You broke up. I did everything I could. I even helped his mom put on her slippers. During dinner, she gave me attitude every time I took a bite. She just wouldn't approve of us. She said that I don't go to college so, we'd have trouble communicating. And while she was saying all that stuff, he just sat there, and didn't even say a word. Damn it. It sounds like you are cursing them. Hell yes. I'm cursing them. I finally had a stable relationship. Why did she have to ruin it? Can you stop smoking? There's not much space here. I already feel horrible. Are you trying to suffocate me? Thank you. I don't want to judge you. But you only focus on things like PhD in law. Housing benefits. -Government officials. -Can you mind the feelings of a heartbroken person? I won't get to live in a big house now. So you are making fun of me. College students. -Can I have some of your beers? -Sure. Is this your girlfriend? Yes, I am. Hello. What do you want for dinner? I will come by later. I will still be here. Great. I should get going. Listen to some music. Would it help at all? How to possess a rainbow? How to embrace the summer breeze? Stars in the sky are laughing At the people below Don't understand Don't feel satisfied If I fall for your smile How to cherish it... Do you have AutoCAD 2006? AutoCAD? Let me check. Sir. You can go to kiosk No. 5014 upstairs. Go up that escalator. They have a better collection. You can try there. Number 5014? -Yes. -Thank you. You can't even pay rent. Why did you send-off your source of income? Xiao-xiao is one of our own. Hi. The guy downstairs told me you might have this. AutoCAD 2006, right? -The guy from downstairs? -Yes. The 2006 one is last year's version. It's outdated. I want the outdated version. You really do have it. Changyou Games. They keep asking if I want to work there. I think bread and butter... is more important than my dreams. I should accept the job. Come to me next time. We have everything. We have the best collection in the whole area.

Who is it this time? -The guy that bought AutoCAD from me. -This can clean everything. -He's been taking a lot of orders lately. -Come and take a look. He works in a state corporation. He will become the head of the division soon. He is an influential man and he is very nice to me. Is that so? Has he already bought you a house? He owns one, but I haven't been there yet. So do you like him? Of course. He always gives me a sense of security. So are you serious about this? I have always been serious. Sir, come to us if you want anything next time. -Help promote us. -Sure. Okay? He likes you with long hair. That's why you changed it. What if he likes you bald? -Do you have the ones with Sora Aoi? -Yes. Not only her. We also have many others. Sayaka Minami, Sakurada Aoi, Asuka Sawaguchi. We've got them all. We have special ways to get them. You look so familiar. You kind of look like that... Sakura something. What are you talking about? Get lost! -Say that one more time... -I said it. The inspectors are here! Get out of here! Get out of here! The inspectors are here! Move it! I can pay you. I'm going to move into my boyfriend's house. I only need the marriage certificate now. Relax, Mom. I'm doing pretty well here. Okay, bye. Keep your eyes open. There are a lot of liars here. Don't get tricked by them. You are just jealous. I get it. All mothers will protect their kids. I'm jealous of you? Girls get in line just so they can be with me. Jealous, my ass. Do you mean the girls in your hard drive? Did you use my computer? So you do have porn? -Are you smoking again? -No. -Say it again. -No. Give me your hand. The hand you use when you smoke. Hurry up and leave, so I can smoke freely. -Sure, let it be the death of you. -I'll keep smoking. The more you smoke, the faster you die. Sure, I will visit you even when I'm dead. Your white hair looks nice after a while. Mom. You worry about me a lot. Are you falling for me? Do you really think you're pretty? Maybe a little. Sort of. Not at all. -Are you into me now? -No. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? -Are you crazy? Stop it! -Don't hold back. -They can hear you. -Let me scream! -Stop it. -I can't take it! I can't take it! Stay away from me! Someone might hear you! Stop screaming! If you don't scream, they might think you've passed out. They might think you're weak. Do as I say. I can't take it! I can't take it! A special discount! Buy five and get one for free. Come and have a look. Come on. Smile. What's wrong? No one to celebrate with? My boyfriend got me a new number. It's our love hotline. I will call you from over there. Let's try it. Is it clear? No ordinary phone can compete with it. It's New Year's eve. Why is he not with you? He's the boss now. He has meetings to attend. Meetings on New Year's eve? He is not treating you well. Of course he is. Why wouldn't he be? Don't say that about him or I'll get upset. Giving you a cell phone doesn't exactly mean he's nice. You are really nosy. Are the inspectors going to be here again? Come on. Let's go celebrate. He has a wife. I told you it's ugly. Come on. Here. It's 20. It's five. Drink up! Fuck 2007! Fuck 2007! Fuck 2007! I think 2007 is for happy people. The ones that are happy will be happier. The ones that are miserable will be worse. -No. -Why not? If two miserable people end up together, they will be happy. Just like my shoes. It will keep getting better. It'll keep getting tougher. We are still young... and we are pretty smart. We won't stay poor for long. We will definitely make it in the end. We will be so successful. Well... How long is that going to take? -Three years. -I don't think so. I don't think so. Three years at most. I don't believe it. I will buy eight houses in Beijing. I will give you one for free. We can be neighbors. If you had so many houses, it would be an issue to maintain them. It's good to just look at them. It would make me happy. I really think what we have is quite nice. -Right? -Yes. It's just you and me now. Listen. That's the countdown to the end of us being poor. The good life is just ahead of us. Five. Four. -Three. -Two. -One. -Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Wait. Hey. What's wrong with you? Leaving without saying a thing. I've been calling you all day, but you didn't answer. Do you think this is your shelter or a hotel? You can come and go as you want. What am I to you? Do you have any respect? Hey. Are you finished? Yes! Can we still be friends? Did I really say that? Remember the time you asked me if we could still be friends? -Yes. -That was really cold. That was your first time, right? Did you forget? You were the one who took your clothes off first. I did. I quickly undressed myself. And then I undressed you. You were still unsure about it. You were all naked, but you had a sock on. I didn't take off my socks? Yes. You were only wearing a sock. I thought that if I had sex with you you would be with me forever. I shouldn't have done it. You are really lucky. In your life, you get to score someone like me. But I came to regret it. Then I won't drink with you, bastard. I actually enjoyed hearing you curse then. Say it again. Bastard. Make it exciting. Make it exciting? Make it exciting. Say something meaner. Did you remember during that time whenever we were going to do it... I'm coming. You liked me doing that. I had no idea what you were doing. After you took your clothes off... Look. I'm coming. I'm coming. You were acting like this. And you're still nagging. Jian-qing. Jian-qing. Jian-qing, I'm in love. I haven't seen you in a while. Jian-qing doesn't live here anymore. Where did he go? He's in there. Where? In there. What happened to him? Are you imitating me? It is pretty normal in this business to go in there a few times a year. No visitors during custody. Please return. IN REPENTANCE, THERE IS SALVATION Welcome to Beijing Dreams can make you great The courage can create miracles -To Beijing! -Yes, Beijing! If you ever go to Beijing, remember to find me and Jian-qing. You can stay at our place. It's a deal. -Great! -Thank you. Xiao-xiao. Jian-qing can't have a break on New Year? Well, it's the video game convention. Many of his colleagues wanted to go, but his boss picked him. He really misses you all. He went shopping for gifts very early and asked me to give them to you. Uncle. Jian-qing said your belt has worn out. See. He thought about you. Uncle. You two only come home once a year. If you didn't come, it would've been two years since you last saw your parents. Jian-qing calls Uncle pretty often. -Right, Uncle? -Xiao-xiao. How long have you been together? -It has been three to four months. -I see. So do you guys use protection? Don't be shy. My line of work is about family planning. Lin. He is looking forward to hearing your good news and having a baby soon. Only then, New Year will be merrier, right? Bye, Aunt. Lin, I'm leaving. I will come by tomorrow. Is video gaming a serious job? Don't get your hands dirty. Don't mind it. When he was in eighth grade, I took him on a business trip to Beijing. When we passed by Zhongguancun, we saw a store selling authentic PC games. Command and Conquer. It was really expensive. It was 160 RMB. Back then, my salary was less than 1,000 RMB a month. The next day, when I went to the bathroom, he locked me in the bathroom. I asked what he was doing. He told me... to buy the game. I said I would beat the crap out of him. He said that if I bought it for him, it would be okay to get beaten by me. -Then? -I bought it. One time, he called me while he was drunk and said, "Thank you, Dad. I wouldn't know what I'd be doing now if you didn't buy that game for me." So I was wondering. He is so obsessed with gaming. Did I contribute to it? LIN'S RESTAURANT Jian-qing. Is he all right? Yes, he is. I'll get going now. IN REPENTANCE, THERE IS SALVATION HAIDIAN PRISON, BEIJING Bean buns? Sticky bean buns. You went to my place? Yes. I thought you might get caught, so I pretended to be your girlfriend. Are you crazy? My girlfriend? Why are you being such a dick? Go away. I have good news. I met someone. Is he from Beijing? No. Does he have a house? No. I will answer all the questions for you. Does he work in a state corporation or in an institution? Is he old? The answer is no. The boyfriend I have this time... He... is rather young. But he doesn't have a regular job. He looks decent. Are you crazy? So are you supporting him? My married ex-boyfriend came to my shop and yelled at me. He said that you beat him up. No. He came to buy some discs and I recognized him. Would you... fly to the sky or what was it? Down the ocean? Pick the stars from the sky and bring pearls from the ocean. Come on. You know that I'm your best choice. You wouldn't find someone else like me if you missed the chance. Come. Two fruit pancakes. I will inspect your work. -Don't mess it up. -I know. These are the drafts of my game. The boy in my game is called Ian. The girl will be called Kelly. Can you explain why this world has never had a story that is happy from the beginning to the end? Happiness is not a story. Misfortune is. Then I don't want to have a story with you. Me neither. Wait! Let me ask you something. What if in your game the boy could never find the girl? If... Ian could never find Kelly, then the world will be colorless. No. Give me your hand. That one. I need to smoke a few more. Where are you, Daddy? I'm at the hotel. Can I look at the left side of the room? On my left? Here. Are there any cars in the room? Now onto the right side, Daddy. There you go. Hurry! A little bit more to the right. There. Can you show me the entire room? There you go. Show me the top part of the room, Daddy. Hurry! Can you see? -I want to look at the bathroom, Daddy. -The bathroom? Hurry! The bathroom. -I miss you so much, Daddy. -You have a such weird habit. Where is Mommy? -When will you come home? -Hey. The nanny has gone back to her hometown. I'm exhausted. I'll have to wait until the weather is clear. All right. Are you cold? -Not really. -What? No. Let's take a taxi. Let's wait for a while. One taxi ride is worth two meals. I want to find a new job. All of a sudden? I can earn a lot in real estate. Aren't you making a new game? It will take some load off of us. Didn't you often say I'm good at making sales? Let's take a taxi. Let's wait. Just wait a while. I won't be poor for long. Who knows maybe I will be rich tomorrow? Taxi. Beijing. Can you hear me? We will be rich soon. We will be rich soon. Beijing. Can you hear me? Working is no longer just to make a living, but it is to watch her smile when I come home. Everyone has a hard time living. I can handle the suffering for her. Hello, my number is 1009. Two people living in Beijing together is better than being alone. I will not only work for myself, but for the both of us. I'm in great pain. I'm feeling really uncomfortable. Get home soon. Get home soon. Hey! It's too big to fit. Come on. Don't you think we need our own couch? Jian-qing is not weak anymore. Jian-qing is not weak anymore. Come here. Let's have some fun. Quick. You can try it. Feel it. Let's have a baby. I don't want children. I'm still living my life. -I'm still young. I'm still a child. -You can enjoy life and still have a baby. Do you really want children? I want you, children, and the whole world. Well, we are so happy together now. If we break up one day, we should never meet again. No way. I have to see you. I have to know how you're doing. No. We've broken up. Do you really need to know? -I just want to know. -It's none of your business. So would you want to see if I'm doing well or doing badly? Tell me. I would be sad if you were miserable. If you were doing well, I would feel bad too. Maybe just be like me or a bit worse than me. How can you say that? You want your ex to do worse? -That's pretty selfish. -No. Not at all. Think about it. If I weren't the only person who made you happy, I would definitely be upset. Right? I wish time would stop now. Right now. Why did we break up? It doesn't matter. What matters is that we can still see each other afterward. So how are you doing now? So-so. I sell whatever can be sold. As for my love life or marriage, I've never met anyone worthwhile. I just broke up with one. A pseudo-foreigner. I even took English lessons for him for about a year. I ran out of money, but he still scammed me. Did you really believe it? I'm worry about you. You would believe everything. You really enjoy teasing me. And you would be glad if I were miserable? I just want to know how you've been. Actually, I got married. I'm moving to America after New Year. We just bought a huge house in Beverly Hills. You are lying to me again. No, I'm not. Look. I'm telling the truth and you don't believe me. I don't know which one is true and which one is not. White lies. We both used it a lot. -Goodness. -What? Did you rent this car? What are you gloating about? You spent all your bonus on this, didn't you? I borrowed some money too. I spent it all on the roast duck. Mr. Roast Duck. Hey, a toast to Jian-qing from Beijing! Hey! Everyone gets to taste the roast duck. It's a local specialty. I got it for you. Where are you working now? I forgot my business card. I work with WTC Skyline. The company has 500 employees. It goes on IPO this year and has a revenue of billions every year. Billions. For 500 people. That's ten million each. Are you nuts? The money goes to the owner. Why would he share it with 500 people? That's also Jian-qing's share. You should have your own business. His boss wouldn't let him go. That's quite a dilemma. You should ask for Wen's help. He said he's doing pretty well lately. You can talk to him about it. -It's fine. -Just call Wen directly. No. It's the New Year. I can talk to him myself. Our classmate Huan Zheng is now the secretary of the county mayor and owns the biggest house of us all. He has the best car too. What's the matter with Jian-qing Lin? We grew up together. There's no need for him to pretend. We just don't want to say the truth. He's still renting somewhere in Beijing. Wait and see. When he needs to buy a house, go to the doctors, or send his kids to school, they will all cost him a fortune. Never mind. It's a matter of pride. Friends supporting each other in life Those days are gone A word of advice For a lifetime Drink up! Come on! It was so fun back in college. Come on. -Give it to me. -Let me pay for it. We can pay for it -Give it to me. -We can pay for it. -It has to be me this time. -Let us pay for it. Give our old friend who came back from Beijing a chance this time. Don't. Hand it to me. Come on. I've got this. No. It's fine. I've got it. Secretary Zheng has already paid. We thank you for coming. One day, when you get really rich, remember to treat us to dinner. Okay? Don't drink too much if you can't handle it. It's okay if you don't have money. You don't need to act like you do. Aren't you tired? Yes. I'm so tired of this place. How will... How will they look at me if I don't pretend? I shouldn't come back here. Let's go. You can go with him. Don't let him drive the car. Not until he sobers up. I'll make you something for your trip. It's fine. It really is. Being rich, getting married, and having a house were never your goals. This is not the life you want. Is this not the life you want? But we are together now. I don't think any of that matters. What do you mean when you say none of it matters? Well, it just doesn't. Why doesn't it matter anymore? Do you think I won't be able to make it? Whether you make it or not, it's not important to me. So you are saying that I can't make it. That is what you're saying. -I didn't say anything like that. -That's what you meant. Think whatever you want. I didn't mean it like that. What exactly did you mean? You have to figure out what you want. What I want? I don't know what you want. You have to know what you want. It's not about what I want. And it turns into what you want too. Having a fight during New Year... No wonder it turned out to be a rough year. I've been calling for two days. Stop talking nonsense. Give me a refund or just charge it... Greetings, sir. How should I address you? Address me? Do we share the same last name? -Are you my dad or what? -Sir, please calm down. How much do you earn in a month? You want me to be nice? Why should I be nice to you? I'm spending money here. I'm cursing at you, you pathetic loser. You think you can be a jerk just because you are rich? Get lost if you aren't going to pay. Suit yourself! Excuse me. Where is the customer service department? It's in there. May I ask? Who is Number 1009? You called me a loser? The loser is here. Teach him a lesson. It's just women. You should come working with me. Girls will line up for you when you become rich. You wouldn't be able to shake them off. Why are you staring at them? I'm just looking. Are you drunk? Let's go home. Don't you know my nickname. What are you looking at? You had too much to drink. -Just ignore him. -Let's ignore him. What's your problem? What's wrong with you? Do you want to fight? Then punch me. Do it. Go ahead. It won't be the same price once the subway has been built. The price will be doubled or tripled. There is only one reserved. Buying a semi-finished house is cheaper. If the price and location are good for you, don't hesitate to buy. I think the view here is good. -Can I hang it here? -Yes. Hey, are you going home for New Year? Yes. -Hi, Uncle. -Hi. Did you use my computer? No. It kept making sounds. So I took a look. The night elf is just an internet friend. An internet friend? What are you two chatting about? She's in the real estate business. I thought if we were going to buy a house, it could be cheaper. We should get a big house, so my dad can come live with us. I'm an agent too. You can ask me. Why are you asking someone you don't know? What's the matter with you? Hello. I have a relative coming to stay. Clear the house immediately. Please move out by tomorrow. Driver, let's go. Hello, Uncle. Hi, Xiao-xiao. How are you doing? Beijing has a lot of people during New Year. Yes, it's flooded with people here. Where's Jian-qing? He's not answering his phone. -Jian-qing. -Yes? Where will you be having dinner for Chinese New Year? In Beijing. Dad, you're so forgetful. We are having hot pot. Barbecue. Roast duck. A lot of things. -We don't need sticky bean buns anymore. -I've saved some for you. Stop worrying so much. There are many people in the house, right? Yes. There are not enough chairs for them. You don't need to worry about me. As long as you are doing well. Jian-qing. That remote control. I told you a hundred times to check the batteries. All right? I'm going to end the call now. -Dad. -Yes? Happy New Year. Yes. -Here. Drink up. -Let's drink. The kids are not coming home? He is busy with work. Let's drink. Happy New Year. So you don't want to talk? I left some noodles for you. After we break up, we should stop seeing each other. Jian-qing. I'm leaving. If you didn't leave, would it make any difference to our relationship? If at that time you had the courage to get on the train, I would've stayed with you forever. If you didn't break up with me... We would break up eventually. If we had enough money, we could live in a big house with a couch. You would probably have ten affairs. What if we just went for it and got married? We would've been divorced for years. What if you could stay to the end with me? Then maybe you wouldn't make it. What if we didn't leave for Beijing? If there are no more ifs... We have everything in the end. Just not each other. Jian-qing Lin. You haven't gone back to Beijing? Nice to meet you. What a coincidence. Congratulations on the big order. Get some rest. Go to bed early. I don't want to go back to the room. Fine. Let's rent a car and drive back to Beijing. It's too funny. I could've been the wife. But now I'm just the home-wrecker. It's a real bummer to have met you. The train has stopped. The plane has stopped. Now the road is closed. Can I be more unfortunate? What do you want anyway? If it wasn't for you, would I spend all those years in Beijing? I should give you an award for being the best ex-girlfriend. Right. You should. Because my good fortune always bring luck to my ex-boyfriends. I remember my ex-boyfriend, my previous ex-boyfriend and another previous ex-boyfriend... To my knowledge, all my ex-boyfriends are doing pretty well. And that is all because of me. I'm the kind of person who brings good fortune to my ex-boyfriends. Don't you find that very cool? I find it very sad. You are all alone. It's pretty miserable. Then I think something's wrong with your values. The reason I refused to leave Beijing... is that I felt... if we moved back to Yaojiang, I couldn't see my future easily. Well, you can see it now too. You are married with children. You live happily. You have a job. You lead a steady life. You see your future very easily. Right. You're right. Jian-qing. Jian-qing. I miss you too. I mean... I missed you. I really feel like the past is right in front of us. We are as childish as when we were young. You haven't grown-up at all you know. You haven't impressed me at all. Do you know that? My deepest sorrow is I don't have the right to feel sorrow. And I'm... in no position to do anything for you. I don't have the right to. Did you even love me? Did you? I have always loved you. The breakup gave me a chance to breathe. Staying in Beijing is like a gamble. Don't lose it all. Only then you'll have a chance. Although, living and not dying are completely different, I have to find a way to go all out. SAY SORRY FOR ME IF YOU MEET KELLY What if in your game the boy can never find the girl? If Ian could never find Kelly, then the world will be colorless. UPLOADING UPLOADED SAY SORRY TO KELLY FOR ME IF YOU MEET HER I'M SORRY NO WORDS CAN DESCRIBE HOW SORRY I FEEL SEEING THINGS FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE SADDENS ME HOW SHOULD I MAKE IT UP TO YOU? Welcome to our team. The number of online players that left sorry notes in the game have just passed 2 million. On behalf of the players, I would like to ask, would you like to apologize to anyone? Of course. I had my doubts when I first came to Beijing. Wondering about my future... Only her. She was the only one who believed in me. I remembered that the elevator was broken one day and we could only climb the stairs to get to our room. I said, "Let's tell a story. Because only an interesting story can help us climb faster." A boy called Ian was separated from his friend named Kelly... He thought she was abducted by aliens. Because she was not with him. He wandered around different planets to find Kelly. On his search mission, he had gone through all sorts of difficulties. A meteor collided, a black hole opened, and bats attacked him. There's a stairway that leads to heaven, but it never seems to end. -He needs to find the key to it. -Find the key fast. I can't climb anymore. Kelly needs to stay close to Ian. Ian needs to hold Kelly tight. So they don't get separated. As long as Ian and Kelly are together, they can travel fearlessly to all planets. This is the beginning of my game. Here is the living room. You can have dinner here with family and friends. It would be very warm and cozy. The price of this location right here will doubled when the subway is ready. And in about ten years later, the price will be the same as the houses in New York. Then, you living in Beijing feels just like living in America. You, your wife and children will have a wonderful time here. Actually, the happiest thing in life is not having money or a house but providing a home for your family. Here is the balcony. Location is really important. The construction and real estate company can tell you the class of the complex. There are many good spots around the complex. Bye. Bye. JIAN-QING: ARE YOU GOING BACK HOME THIS YEAR? JIAN-QING: HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING? JIAN-QING: SHOULD WE GO BACK TOGETHER? MY DAD ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT YOU I COULDN'T TELL HIM THAT WE BROKE UP You don't have to look at these. Just memorize it. Look. For the channels... The is the HDMI button. This is for cable TV. See. There are more channels. This is the volume button. You can try it. It is on, right? Closer. Get closer. You can give it another try. Press this. I'll teach him. Why did I turn it off? It's on. Look, Uncle. Never mind. Just press this button. OK. OK. -This button is for-- -I don't want to learn it. My sight... is getting worse now. I can't see things clearly. You didn't go to the doctors? I don't think it's a big deal. I just got old. It's nothing. Don't worry. -Dad. -Yes? After New Year, you can move in with us. I bought a house. I'll just let you young people live together. All happily. There is no need to take care of me. Just move in with us. I had it all decorated. You and Xiao-xiao can come live together. I'm not going. Why not? We can look after you if you live with us. I don't need you to look after me. What if you get sick? Beijing has better medical treatment than here. I'm still pretty healthy. You can have your eyes checked in Beijing. To see what's wrong with it. Or what else would you do? Staying in this crappy restaurant for the rest of your life? What do you mean crappy restaurant? It helped me feed you, and paid your tuition. Why is it a crappy restaurant now? Then why did I leave you and go to Beijing for? I want us to have a good life. Don't you get it? That is a good life for you. I'm living a good life here. You think you can simply arrange other people's life when you're rich? So what if I could? I'll just come back once a year. Suit yourself. I'm not going. You are too much. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? Don't you get it as well? I don't get it. I bought you a house. I bought my dad a house. I thought you would be happy. Did I do anything wrong? No, you didn't. You are so right. The reason why I dated you is that you could afford a house. Your dad raised you for 20 years because all he wants is a house. When I got my first paycheck, I went straight to find a house. Why? Just because... Never mind. Say it. Just because I didn't have a house... I didn't break up with you because of that. I wanted a home. I know. I know you wanted my love and a home. I can do it now, Xiao-xiao. I got the money. I got the house. I can give you an address in Beijing. I can fulfill your wish. Can't this be considered as love? Xiao-xiao. Xiao-xiao. You have someone else, don't you? Are you out of your mind? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Please give me another chance. I will do my best. If you thought back then I couldn't endure the tough times with you, why would you assume that I could live the good life you wanted with you now? Xiao-xiao, I really don't understand you. You never did. You never did. I tried really hard to become what you want me to be. But I'm not the same person now. Can we make it home? Just like my dad said, "Wherever we go, we are the outsiders." When my dad passed away, he was still thinking about you. Dad. -Jian-qing. -Why did you come here? Xiao-xiao is back. Are you hungry? Let's go home. Hold my dad. I was driving one day, and I saw you in a red sports car. I followed you everywhere. You were going too fast, I couldn't catch up. It would be great if I caught up with you. The red sports car. Remember? I promised I'd buy two of them for you. You could take turns to drive them. I never drove any red sports car before. You missed me too much. So it was just your imagination. Time to leave. We always parted in a hurry. This time, let's bid our farewell properly. Jian-qing Lin. Goodbye. Xiao-xiao Fang. Goodbye. Pick the stars from the sky, bring the pearls from the ocean. You will. You will find that person. We're going to be fine. That's right. TO: XIAO-XIAO I'm telling you. You need to take care of Yang-yang's school admission. Kindergartens in Beijing are hard to get in now. Whether Yang-yang goes to a good school or not, it all depends on you. BEIJING TO YAOJIANG TO: MS. FANG BEIJING TO YAOJIANG TRAIN TICKET FROM BEIJING TO YAOJIANG Hi, Ms. Fang. -Yes. -For you. Xiao-xiao. It's almost New Year. I just made two stacks of sticky bean buns. When I took them out of the pot, the smoke covered my eyes. I've still kept a stack for you this year. I always tell you two that home cook meals are the best. The food out there just can't compare. I always wanted to send some food to you. I can't ask Jian-qing about it. The television is broken, Dad. Look. I'll be there right away. Lately, he seemed more mature. And I know it was because of you. About fate, as long as you don't fail each other, that's enough. It is really hard to spend your whole life together. You may have to get older to understand such feelings. As a parent, whom you choose to be with, or whether you make it or not, doesn't really matter. I just hope you can live the life you want and stay healthy. Now that I'm old and can barely see, Jian-qing keeps saying that I know nothing. That year at the train station, I thought I was holding your hand, but it wasn't you. Xiao-xiao is back. Come on. Let's go home. It's good to have you back. I realized it then. Even if you two couldn't make it as a couple, we would still be a family. Xiao-xiao, take care of yourself. Come home anytime when you're tired. I'M SORRY IAN WILL ALWAYS LOVE KELLY BASED ON HOME, CHINESE NEW YEAR XING MENG, I'M MISERABLE WITHOUT YOU ZHONG-ZHI TU DARN IT.

I saw Xiao-xiao. She seemed to be doing well. I could tell you were worried about us back then. I also knew, even though you never asked, you knew what was going on. I'm learning bit by bit the recipe you gave me. Although, I haven't been able to replicate the same taste. I wanted to apologize to you. I could've taught you how to use the remote more patiently. But I didn't. I could've listened eagerly to the stories from your past. But I didn't. I could've spent more time with you. But I didn't. I could've held your hand and said some nice words. But I didn't. Dad. You're with Mom now, right? Don't worry about us now. We're all doing well. Are you hungry? Let's go home. This is my first letter to you. If I have things to tell you in the future, I'll write to you again. I'm sure you would be able to hear me. It's a pity I couldn't tell you this in time. Dad. I love you. I love you dearly. I'm sure you could hear me. Jian-qing. DON'T WAIT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE TO SAY, "I'M SORRY" DON'T WAIT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE TO SAY, "I LOVE YOU" We're going to be fine. That's right.
