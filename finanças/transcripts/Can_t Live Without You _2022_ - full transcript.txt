Hey, don't laugh. I want to help you whatever way I can to start your own family, all right? I know, Mom, and I love you. But it's not easy. We know that. We have to figure out how, adoption is mission impossible. - Oh... - Right. And we think a surrogate mother is a bit... Illegal, say it, that's the word you're looking for, huh? - Keep out of it! - Excuse me? Don't start, Ángel, we know what you think. Too right. Anyway... - Want anything from the kitchen? - Some ice, please. Listen. I have some savings. - Please, Mom. - How much is it? Your mother-and-law asked... for a soft drink, where are they? - What you need is a coffee. - A coffee? You've overdone it. Why do you say that? - I'm absolutely fine. - Absolutely fine... You're the one who's overdone it. He's totally hammered, right? You bet. I don't think he'll make it home. He's not staying here. Tomorrow he'll settle himself on the couch and won't budge. Sure, sure. Don't say you weren't warned. What have you brought me? A soft drink, something cold. Sit down and I'll tell you something. - Ready? - Sure. We'd have really great ♪♪♪... if you weren't gay, of course. If you were a guy, we'd make a great couple. Is your ex trying to hit on my mom? What are you on about? It's your mom hitting on Ángel. - As if... - Just look. You're a wonderful woman... That's a good one. I'm tipsy. It's time to go and get some rest. I know, but hang on... Let me say goodbye to my son. - Bye, honey. - They see each other every day. I had a great time. Just look at him... - Bye. - Hey, keep your distance! - What a laugh. - The cup stays here. Honestly, I had a fantastic time. See you soon, sweetie. - Bye, honey. - Take care. - Your turn next time. - David! - Bye, Ángel. - Watch out, he's a real fuckot. Bye, Ángel. - Talk tomorrow. - Leave "Linder" alone. Bye. - Bye. - Have another coffee. God, what a family. David, wake up! Wake up! Open up! Blanca called me. How is she? She's out of rehab. Says she's a clean as a whistle. Sure, let's see how long she stays that way. Mind you, she wants her money. What money? Just what I needed to hear. Look, send her a transfer and get her off your back, she can be such a pain. Blanca isn't entitled to anything. Think about it, okay? I've nothing to think about, just tell me the basics. I'm on it. Thanks. We're turning up the heat! Keep up the speed! You guys did awesome, yes, sir. Fantastic! Come on, guys! You got this! Rock it! Did you check all the slots? I think so. - Excuse me. - Yes? - Did I scare you? - Yeah, no worries. Sorry, sorry. I really liked your class, but I don't think I'm fit enough. - Are you Mexican? - Yes, is it that obvious? Cool, I love your country. Truth is, I've never done sport. - Never? - No, never. All right, we could do a physical fitness test and depending on the result, take it from there. - Sounds great. - Awesome. Sorry, got to go. I'm Alex by the way. - Blanca. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. - Bye. Bye. - He's cute. - Very cute. Bet he's already taken, huh? Yeah, but he's not a monk. What are you suggesting? Are you crazy, man? Seriously? All right. So are we going running together? What do you mean? No, I'm about to leave work. No idea, twenty minutes, half an hour. These sweltering hot days will mean maximum and minimum temperatures between 5-10 degrees above... And they may also exceed average temperatures by ten degrees in parts of the north-east and the south. All this, plus midsummer heat... And now over to our news bulletin. I've had time to think it over. Glad to hear it. You're looking good. Thanks. I didn't kill my parents. What's this, Blanca? Evidence that proves I'm innocent. I want you to reopen the case. I don't have time for this now. A case can't be opened without a new testimony. No judge would accept an appeal for a judicial review. Quit playing with me. I didn't burn down my parent's house. You don't remember anything because you were high as a kite. You took LSD. Do you really want to relive that hell? A pity, I was under the impression that you'd changed, but... No, I guess I'm just naïve. Goodbye. My mom couldn't stand the thought of not living in Mexico. She was depressed for years and she couldn't stand my dad. What if she put the whole family to sleep? She tried to commit suicide. Did you never think of that? She never screamed out in public that she hated her family and wanted them dead. And that was heard by a neighbor who testified at the trial... Christ, leave me alone! The only thing she shouted was: "David, help your sister!" I love this one. Okay, it needs renovating, but the good thing is it includes a gym. But it costs 5,550 euros a month. Isn't that steep? Yes, but the realtor said, depending on the investment, - we can negotiate a waiting period. - Sure. God, I'm dying for us to have our own business. Promise me we'll calculate the investment properly. I'll promise you whatever you want, hun. Hun. I'm not in the mood. How about tomorrow? I'm going for a run. You're not taking steroids, are you? You know I quit them months ago. Sure. Let's get out of here. You go ahead. I'm hanging out with Rafa. My gorgeous Mexican. Let's go! Rafa. Hey, are you okay? Take it easy. - Are you all right? - I had a nightmare. Come on, easy. You scared me. - I'm done. - Don't be lazy, four more. Three, two... - Focus. - Are you trying to kill me? - Let's do this. - Seriously? - Absolutely. - Cool. Crouch. Jump. Your turn, okay? Come on, you've got this. Quit exaggerating! If you think I'm going to let you off, you're wrong. Up we get. I'm not bothered about the jump, I want to see the drive. - The what? - Come on. You've got it. - No, I'm done. - No, come here, you cheat. Hun, are you in the pool? Yeah. Hi, hun. Shall we eat? I want to introduce you to a friend from the gym. Oh, great. Blanca? - I don't believe it. - Do you know each other? I'm his sister. Did he never mention me? So, how about you explain what's going on here? - Explain what? - Your sister, for example. You said she died in the fire. For me she did. I thought I'd never see her again. All right, so? David! Why are you here? I'm really pleased to see you too. I don't believe you're here by chance. Okay, okay, let's all calm down a bit. She's here because of me. I thought that you'd like to meet another Mexican. There's no way that she could know - you're my partner. - Sure. Alex, I think it's best I go. Yeah. That's best. Sorry, Blanca. I'll show you out. Now I find out that to you I'm a sort of roommate with benefits, of course. Stop talking nonsense. Why did you tell me your sister was dead? Why didn't you tell me something that important? I don't get it. - What don't you get? - Why did you lie to me? She was the one who started the fire in which my parents died. And in which I nearly died. She was in prison for years. I hadn't seen her for ages. So it wasn't an accident? No, it wasn't an accident. Blanca was out of her head on drugs that night. I don't know if she did it deliberately or by accident, but... The fact is that she did it. Do you know how hard it is living with a junkie? Blanca's a junkie? - She doesn't look like one. - I know. She seems charming. But it's just a question of time. We'll see how long she keeps it up. I heard she just got out of rehab. Ángel told me everything. Hang on, hang on. Ángel knows about all this? Don't start, hun. - He's an attorney. - And what am I to you? The love of my life. My everything. Is there anything else I should know? Hun... I don't like talking about the past. Fine, you don't like talking about it, but we can discuss getting married and having kids. How do we start a family if you don't trust me? You're absolutely right. I'll tell you everything. What are doing here, cheeky? Excuse me, do you know where number 69 is? Yes I do, that way. Look at that, Jorge's here too. Coming? Shall we start? Read this. "I didn't kill my parents, you must believe me." David is my only family. "Help me to get him back." High drama. I think what those two need is a little bit of help. We all need help now and again. I don't get why he lied to me. It'll all work out, you'll see. You make a lovely couple. How the fuck would it be the same as this shit? Get off my fucking back! Fucking hell! My gorgeous Mexican. Where have you been? On vacation. As if. Let me take a look at you. - You look different. - You reckon? - Yeah. - Different? Yeah. - How about you? - Nope. A little line for my gorgeous Mexican. I'm clean. Stop shitting me, seriously? You were quite something. - How long? - Two years. - Pretty much since we last met. - Pretty much. That's why you look so good. Talk to me, I love it. Remember when we were kids and we came to this dive every Saturday? And Sundays, and Mondays... Remember Sebas? Fuck Sebas, he only gave us shit gear. Is he still alive? How would I know? I'll never forget his LSD. Remember the night of the fire? Why would I remember? Because you were there. I knew it. You're always looking for something. You don't wanna get high or screw. What do you want? Here, dummy. I already said everything I had to say: I saw nothing. I ran off when I saw your a♪♪♪oledad thrashing your brother. That's not true. Last time you told me you fell asleep in the garden. What are on about? When did I tell you that? Try and remember. - Please. - It's amazing. You're out, you're clean. You're clean, right? You can't stop stirring the shit, trying to be happy. What a way to beat yourself up. For fuck's sake. I don't intend to sleep tonight. Ángel, I'm not interested in your ♪♪♪ life. So? How did it go with Blanca? She's delusional. She wants a judge to issue a review of her case. - Jesus. - She's convinced she had nothing to do with the fire. Now this? I don't believe it. She's obsessed with proving her innocence. If you want to get of her for good, give her money. Money? It's the last time I'll say it. Ángel... The last time I did that she almost died of an overdose. Remember? Excuse me, do you intend to bring us our food or do we have to eat each other? I'm going to the restroom. I'll kill you! You fuckot! Get out! Get out! What are you doing? No! Stop it! David! Help your sister! - Sorry, can I ask you something? - Yeah, sure. Do you know these pills? A friend recommended them. What do you think? No, this isn't for you. This has steroids. - It's for guys. - Just as well I didn't try them. Well, it works for them, makes them real honey. - No! - Yeah. Great exercise for our beach booty! Three! Four. Come on, Nieves, jump. One, two! Three, four! Squats again! One, two! Three, four! Steps, Andrés. One, two, three. Hey, Blanca, are you okay? Blanca? - Fetch some ice. - Are you all right? - It hurts here. - Here? Yeah, a lot. Take it easy, take it easy. Breathe. Hi, hun. - Hi, sweetheart. - I ordered sushi. Yummy. What are you doing here? What happened? Sprained her ankle on the step. I'm to blame, I shouldn't have... Let her talk. I twisted my ankle. We spent over three hours - in ER. - At least. I can't put weight on my foot. Right. Obviously, she can't go home like this. Don't you see what's going on? What? She wants to judge me. Judge both of us. And no, I don't want sushi. Do you really believe it was an accident? I was right in front of her, it was an accident. Sure... Your sister owned up that she's sleeping in the changing rooms. Really? How would you be if you'd spent eight years in prison? Honey. Give it time, okay? That way you take it slow and decide if you want her out of your life, or if having a sister isn't so bad. Personally, I'd love to have one. Here's some water. If you need a bathroom, there's one off the hall, the door on the left. Get some rest. - Sorry to be a nuisance. - No. But you owe me. I owe you nothing. - Did I save your life? - Yes. No one asked you to. Don't blackmail me with that. What do you want? Don't you want to know what happened the night of the fire? Why don't you believe me? - I didn't want to kill them. - Look, if you're going to start with that... I think that it's best you leave tomorrow. This house is mine as well. Please just let it go. Okay. Before I leave I'll tell Alex what kind of brother you are. Shall I go into detail? Do whatever you want. Goodnight. All good? Did you sleep here? Yes, hun. I spent the whole night here. - Come here. - What? I can't now. I have a meeting. I'm going to waste here. As forecast, it was very hot early Wednesday morning. Temperatures soared in many places in Spain. At 6 am, cities such as Saragossa, Madrid or Barcelona reported over 23 degrees, while in Seville, Murcia or Almería, the thermometers had already hit over 24 degrees. Morning. - Nice T-shirt. - It belongs to Alex. Yeah, I got that. I don't have any clothes. I'm making your favorite breakfast: fried frijoles with toast. Thanks, but I don't eat frijoles now. Like the ones Mom made for you and for Dad. Sure, but I don't want any. When you try them, - it'll remind you... - I don't want any fucking frijoles! Look, Blanca, you can't stay here. You stress me out. Please help me. It'll be different this time. No, I'm running late. Let me spend your birthday here. Can I stay? - Morning. - Morning. - Something smells burnt. - Yes, I had a little accident. How did you make it this far? I dragged myself. Be careful. Look after yourself or it won't get better. I can manage fine. What's all this? David's favorite breakfast, and my dad's. Wow, looks delicious. Hi, sweetheart. I'm going to spend afternoons at home. See if you can be there in the mornings. I don't want Blanca there alone. Bye. What are you still doing here? They're waiting for us in the board room. It's insane today, isn't it? I'm having a bit of a weird day. Oh, yeah? How so? Blanca? At home. What do you mean? She turned up, now she's moved in. Hello. Sorry about the delay, but here we are. - How are you? - Whenever you're ready. Thank you. - It hurts me there... - I know. I know, it has to hurt. That's it. And your toes? Do they hurt? My toes don't, but my ankle does. Okay, put your foot in the water. - Feeling better? - Yes. I'm going to let you go. Hang on, hang on. See how you can't leave here? Welcome! Down you go! It was tougher than I thought. One, two... Very nearly... Come on, sit here. The information we asked for. This is so exciting! The USA offers the best guarantees. My family references aren't the best, but... - I think I can break the curse. - I'm sure of it. Hang on, 150,000 euros? - A lot of money, huh? - A bit. Maybe it's best for us to set up the business first, save some money and then see. Or I sign the contract with the new client. Cross your fingers. - Ah, by the way... - What? - Happy birthday. - You remembered? Of course I did. I know it's not your style, but a touch of color is always good. - Seriously? - Look how it suits you. - What? - Fantastic. - It brightens up your face. - Exactly. Thanks, hun. Have a great day. Bye, hun. Bye, hun. What a racket. Morning! Morning. - Where's David? - He just left. I wanted to say happy birthday. - Call him, he must be in the car. - Right, but it's not the same. You want to have kids? We're exploring options, we haven't decided yet. - It's very complicated and expensive. - Yes. - Want some coffee? - Yes, please. Freshly brewed coffee for the young lady, coming up. Warning: it's quite strong. Delicious. David is super excited about it. Is he? What about you? Even more so. I've always wanted to be a dad. Two kids. Being an only child is a pain in the ♪♪♪. Yeah, you're right. I don't know what my life would have been like without David. Probably a lot more boring. Yeah, you better believe it! I gave you that contract, it should be in your office... - What contract, Ángel? - This one. Surprise! - What's this? - What can I say? You know I don't like surprises. Happy birthday! - Blanca is lovely. - Sure. Happy birthday. - Did you know about this? - Me? - I'm just the messenger. - All your sister's doing. Happy birthday, bro. Can you help me with the rest? I can't manage. - I'll go, you come with me. - Thanks. Thanks, Blanca. You shouldn't have bothered. I really enjoyed preparing this for you. I cooked Mexican stuff that you love: enchiladas, guacamole, tortillitas made with corn... I adore Mexican cuisine. I didn't know you cooked. There's a lot you don't know. - Here. - I don't drink. Never? Once is too much, a thousand times is too little. It's an addict thing. I'll take that. I'll go and see if they need help. Blanca, I wanted to say sorry about the other day, what you asked is impossible, you know? I wanted to apologize. I don't want apologies. I want justice. - Here's the pie. - I can't eat anymore. The pie... Wow, it was all delicious. Amazing. Yeah, Blanca. Thanks. Your gift was exquisite. But this isn't your gift. I thought of giving it to you after dessert... but whatever... I'm the gift. Well, not me, my womb. It sounds weird saying it out loud, right? Anyway, what I want to say is that I'm going to be your child's mother. Cheers! You're joking, right? No, it's not a joke, even if it seems crazy. I've thought about it a lot. I've given it a lot of thought. Yes. You know I've never got your weird sense of humor. But I'm offering you the chance to have the child that you both want so much. I think she means it. What's more, I've heard cases of relatives - who help, even friends. - Mom, please. David, you're my brother. What better way to show you how much I love you? Besides, this way we can make up for all the lost time, time that we were so stupid to waste. You never cease to amaze me. You always hog the limelight. Get used to it. Happy birthday, David. Promise me you had nothing to do with it. What? I had no idea, it's totally crazy. But relax, we can think it over. How do you want me to take it easy? She's a psycho. How could she be so dumb? All she wants to do is show you she loves you. And to be honest, you could chill out a bit more about things. Sorry, it's just... Blanca stresses me out, I get nervous. I know, I know this is tough for you. Look, it's okay. We say no, thank her for her offer, but we're not interested. - That's it, okay? - Okay. Even so... I think we could consider it as one more possibility. Are you serious? Blanca is family. Faggot! Get out! Get out of my house! Stop it! You little shit! You set it up! Know what I'm going to do? - No! - Get out! - Out, both of you! - Leave them alone! Get off! Leave them alone! Don't ever hit my children again! Get out of my way! We're a shitty family! I wish you would all die! Every second Saturday I wake up with a cute guy, so hey, you fit the bill. You like them to beg, don't you? Don't make him suffer. Do you think that party made sense? I can think of other adjectives. Excessive, over the top, melodramatic. Blanca is only interested in you. She's thrown me out. No, excuse me, you've left Alex there with that bimbo. Go home and get her out before she causes more trouble. No quarrels, though, we don't need them. I think it's best if I leave, this isn't going to work. He gets worked up when I'm around. He needs time. He can't stand me being close to him. That's not it, he's overworked and he gets stressed. Sure. I ordered sushi. You sure know how to win me over. We bought food. - We missed you. - So did I. How was your swim? Awesome. No, really? Come on, I don't believe it. I wanted to apologize. Because... I haven't treated you well. I totally understand why you don't trust me. I wasn't a good sister to you. And I've really changed. I'd like to live a normal life. I know. I can see that. I gave it some thought and... I want to help you. I'll give you some money. Thanks. I want to find somewhere to live and... Of course I want to work, but you know how it is without money. I know. Count on it. Thanks. Guess who I met? - Who? - Rafa. Rafa? Rafa who? My boyfriend when I was 18. How's he doing? He's the dealer at Hot. Remember that dive? He ended up a dealer? Oh, Blanca. This rehab thing isn't easy. It's hard work. That's our condition. I'm going to support you. But if you don't relapse, okay? You still don't believe me, do you? I'm innocent, David. And I'll prove it to you. I know. This Blanca sitting in front of me... looking me in the eye... isn't the Blanca who burned the house down. That was the other Blanca. The drug addict. The junkie. You don't have to prove anything to anyone. Honey! Can you hang up already? The sushi is getting cold. Coming. Why didn't you start? You know... Some non-alcoholic sangria. - Delicious. - What a lovely thought. - Ladies first, right? - Go ahead. - Shall we make a toast? - All right. - What are we toasting? - Let's drink to Blanca. And to David. Here's to us. Tell him to call me later and we'll see. What's up? - Are you here to score? - No. I'm here to negotiate with you. Pour me a beer. You can get 5,000 euros for this watch. Are you trying to buy me with a stolen watch? If I prove I didn't set fire to the house, I'll get my inheritance. Oh, now we're talking dough. What's your theory? Go on. I was so high that night, I passed out. When I opened my eyes, the house was in flames. It's impossible that I gave them sleeping pills. It had to be someone else. I've been going over it again and again. It's impossible, Rafa. I need you to tell me what you saw the night of the fire. You get that people lie, right? I could tell you any old shit and not bat an eyelid. How much are we talking about? Is the water nice? Yeah, fabulous. Not coming in? - Yeah, I'll get changed. - Okay. Yeah, it is fabulous! What are you up to? Hi, hun. Get ready and I'll pick you up. Why? Because I love you, isn't that reason enough? Of course, sure. Get dressed up, I'm taking you to a beautiful place. Awesome, I'm on it. See you later. - Who were you talking with, fuckot? - Quit being a gossip. You look like you're going to meet your hot jock. You spend more time here than in your own office. - I'll report you for harassment. - You're on such an ego trip. I've no idea how your boyfriend puts up with you. Why are you here? Didn't you hear? - About what? - Supersport want a new clause. - Really? - Yes. About what? They ask for a million in compensation if you fire them before the stipulated three years is up. Treat me to lunch? No can do, I have to pick up Alex. Bring him along, I like admiring his pecs, too, - when he picks up a glass of wine. - Sure. Don't you want to admire my pecs? I want you to French kiss me right here. You'll kick yourself when you hear what I have to tell you. Ground floor. - Right, a new intern. - No. Just tell me already. Your sister's ex-boyfriend, this Rafa guy, remembered something about the fire that he hadn't told anyone. Rafa? He didn't even testify. He said he ran off. So he lied. Blanca insisted in reopening the case. As her attorney, my duty is to listen to her witness. It seems that Rafa told her that he fell asleep next to a tree in the garden and when he woke up he saw Blanca all groggy on the couch. Blanca's theory is that she was so high she fell asleep. And it was your mother who gave you the sleeping pills. My mother? No. - That's impossible. - This all seems a bit weird. I think Blanca wants her part of the inheritance. And can she claim it? Well, she can if she's not guilty. I don't want Alex to know a thing. Call Alex. I'll drive, you pick up the bill. Why so quiet? What's up? My brother is up to his old tricks with you. Did he not take your call? Or did he stand you up? HIGH PROBABILITY OF GETTING PREGNANT TODAY - Morning, hun. - Hi, hun. I didn't want to wake you. You got in late last night, huh? Yeah, sorry, something came up and... - It got late. - It's fine. We need to talk, something happened yesterday. Oh yeah? What happened? I accepted Blanca's offer. What offer? We were in the pool... It was hot, I drank... I got drunk, I was really mad with you... And it happened. It happened? I don't want to know a thing. Don't even think about giving me the details. I know there's no excuse. It was stupid of me, I let myself go and... But maybe it's not such a bad idea. Think about it. With my sister? How could you... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Hang on. - Don't follow me. - Yes? - David. I wanted to know if you're coming. Yeah, sure. I had a meeting outside Madrid, but I'll be there. Bad news? No, I'll tell you later. Please don't ignore me. Of course not. I have to go by the office but... Wait up for me. - Hello. - Hello, darling. Out here all alone? I was waiting. What about Alex? He's here. All good? Fine. Okay... I'll grab a beer. Want something? I'll have one too. - Fine. - Not for me, thanks. Check it out, he's wearing sneakers. Are they new? Yeah, new client. - Alex! - Yes. Will you help me? Thanks. Cheers. Blanca's coming to live with me. She's moving in. Really? Thanks. Well, here we are. - Right. - Thanks, Maite. You're welcome, sweetie. Hi, Blanca. Hi. You had a supercalifragilistic idea, let's see it they accept. Why are you talking so weird? - Can I have a coffee, please? - Sure. I took my niece to the movies yesterday. "Supercalifragilistic buddypincher explodingfarts" is the latest slang 8-year-old girls are using. Here, place a contract in front of each file. All right? By the way, this Rafa guy, Blanca's witness and ex-boyfriend, didn't turn up at the meeting. He's not picking up either. We phoned him a bunch of times. - These junkies can't be trusted. - I said so. Yeah, sorry, Mom. I don't know, maybe you have sunburn. You love sunbathing. Well if it hurts, go see a doctor. Hey, how's it going with Blanca? Great, huh? David is a lot more relaxed now. Okay, fantastic. Okay. If you want... Jesus, you scared me! Got to go, Blanca is here. Talk soon. Love you, Mom. - Sorry. - It's okay. Sorry, I took them by mistake. David will be here any minute, I'll make some more. I'm pregnant. I know: just from screwing once? That's what I thought too. I was surprised, but look. What? Isn't this what you wanted? - Jesus, not like this. - Not like this? How? Alex... David is mad with both of us. What does it matter? You have to adapt. Besides, you'll save a stack of money. We're going to have a baby. Yours and mine. David won't accept it. I'm having the baby. I'll tell him. No, Blanca, leave it to me. Okay, okay. Blanca. What a surprise. We did it. I'm pregnant. Why not say you did it? I did what you wanted, I'm helping you start a family. I don't want to start any goddamn family if you're in it. It's best if you go, Blanca. Why do you hate me? Because you screwed up my life when you started using. And you were to blame for Mom's depression. You should have left me to die with them, goddamn it! Get off me! See? I'm to blame for everything. All I'm guilty of is being born into a fucking shit family with a violent father and a mother who lived in fear. I deserve to be happy too. David! Get out of here. I don't want to see you. Hey, Sleeping Beauty. You've been in a coma for 20 hours. What did you give me? I should have given you a couple of good slaps. For getting mixed up with a jock who's never read a book. For wanting kids with him, for letting your sister into your home. - All you need is a psycho next door. - Cut it out. Quit yakking, I feel like c♪♪♪. You took two tranquilizers. Let's have some lunch, I have to go and play golf. You can sleep it off here or mull over stuff. I never got why you liked golf. Well, you know, it's the only sport I can do exercise and talk non-stop. It figures. I was thinking... There's a pattern to your sister's behavior. Do we have to do this while eating tacos on a Sunday? We can screw if you'd prefer that. I'd prefer a taco. I'm sorry. I've acted like a jerk with you. I'm not going to argue with you on that one. But as I was saying: her teenage years were ruined by drugs, beatings... I got beaten too. Yes, I know. But she spent eight years in jail. She clings to you because you're all she has. No. She moved in with Alex's mom and with him. Blanca wants to get rid of me. Alex is totally irrelevant. Are you absolutely sure about what happened that night? Jesus, think about it. The only one who took tranquilizers and antidepressants was your mother. Blanca is right, why couldn't she have drugged you all? My mom was barely able to keep herself alive. Why would she kill us all? Why didn't she give pills to Blanca? I don't know. You took on the case. It was clear that Blanca drugged us. The neighbor heard her wish us dead. I don't know, Ángel, I don't know. I don't want to remember that fucking time! The heatwave doesn't appear to be letting up. Remember our advice: if you have to go out during the hottest part of the day, drink plenty. And now over to our news bulletin. A body was found this morning in the Pontón reservoir in the province of Segovia. The 40-year-old man was identified as Rafael Monleón. Monleón was last seen a month ago and had been reported missing. The cause of death has not been disclosed. This Wednesday the president requested that the PP party lend a hand supporting the government in negotiating European funds in Brussels, while the Partido Popular leader, Pablo Casado, criticized him, saying he wants unconditional support. In a much more cordial tone than usual, Casado guaranteed his support... I really don't know what to tell you, Blanca. I have to go, David is here. When did you get here? I didn't hear you. She's got you, your mother, and now your kid... I'm taking a short vacation. I want you out of my house. It's over, Alex. David, not like this. Please wait a second. David! Good afternoon. Sorry for calling on a Sunday. Can I talk with the medical examiner? Yes. Thank you. Ángel! There you are. All sorted. - Want a drink? - Yeah, a whiskey would be great. Well... I told Alex to leave, so... The dressing room is all yours. I need two days off. I'm going to Ibiza. Want to come? Why do I get the impression that I'm putting my career on the line with you? It turns out that Rafa, your sister's junkie ex-boyfriend, was found dead. Right... Are you glad? One junkie more, one junkie less... What can I say? I don't know. I get it, but... The fact he was killed just hours before I was meant to hear his statement and decide whether to submit an appeal for a review is a bit strange. Know the most worrying thing? They found one of those blue leather tassels, the kind loafers have, it got caught on his ring. Like the loafers you wear. That doesn't prove anything. And this? I'm wondering how you'll explain it to the judge, because I... I'm not sorting out any of your family problems. I've realized that you never told me the truth about what happened. Why did you come to me? So that means I... let myself be fooled. Because I fell in love. I fell in love with you. I fell in love. All this time I was fighting to save you from that nightmare. Blaming Blanca. I had her put in prison and she was innocent. She was innocent. I'm asking you: was she innocent? No. Blanca isn't innocent of anything. Answer me one thing. Were you ever in love with me? What kind of question is that? Of course I was. So in love. Blanca is to blame for everything. Even for saving me the day I took my mother's pills. What? What did you just say? David. Everything is your fault. Always. He wants to kill me! What's going on? EIGHT YEARS LATER Come on, follow me. - Grandma. - Yes, honey? I want candy. Daddy has them. - Daddy. - Yes, sweetie? I want candy. You want candy all day long, this will never do. You can't eat candy all the time. Let's ask Mommy. Shall we give her candy? After the cake. Tell your friends we're going to cut it. - Okay. - Hurry. Thanks. - I'll be back, someone's at the gate. - Sure. Thanks.
