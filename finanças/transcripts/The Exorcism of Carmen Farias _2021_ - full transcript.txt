Carmen! Put this on, Mom. Daughter... - Come into me, Lord. - No, Mom. I'll call for help. Forgive me. - Forgive... - Mom. Doctor! Doctor! - Mom! - Allow me. - Give her 2 mg of epinephrine. - In her IV or direct? Hey, honey. This is all I have of hers. I just realized I have no family left. Listen. I'm still here. OK? What if there's nobody else after me? Do you think it's my fault that we lose them? No, no. Don't think that. We just have to wait a while, OK? My child... how are you? To think that I just saw your mom. How nice, you had your baby! I'm so sorry. How are you doing? Wouldn't you prefer coffee? Yes. Here. It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. "I, Rocio Farias Andrade will to my daughter Carmen Farias Hinojosa all the rights over my assets, bank accounts, property..." Property? Yes. She mentions your grandmother's house. Yes, I know that house. But I thought she sold it a long time ago, - and she didn't have anything. - Where is it? Does it say anything else? She gave me the keys to your grandmother's house in El Oro. I need you to sign here, please. And... here are the documents. Yes, thank you. Here you go. Very well. That concludes my obligation. - Thank you. - And again, I'm sorry for your loss. Hello! Come here. Hello! - So? - So, what? What are you going to do about your grandmother's house? I don't know. I don't know, I wasn't thinking about that. I don't know why my mom didn't just sell it. How long has it been since you've gone? Several years. - Why don't we go? - No. We should take a look. Think about it. A weekend. For a change of scene. Hurry up. Hey, what is it, are you all right? - I'm fine, darling. - Nightmares? Go back to sleep. - What did you dream? - Go to sleep. Want me to bring you something? No? Hi. Hey. - I think you're right. - Obviously I'm right! About what? About going to my grandmother's house. It's really weird, it's like I feel like going and looking around to learn more about my family, get to know my grandmother. Yeah, I like the idea. - Where are you going? - To pack. So you want to leave right away? Yes. I'm going to show you pictures. - Of what? - My grandmother. Fine. THE EXORCISM OF CARMEN FARIAS It's great. Kind of rundown, but great. What’s the story behind it? I didn't remember it was so big. - Let's open the gate. - Let's go. Tomasa, come here! Hey, beautiful. You like it? Will you help me? Let me do it. There we go. Is it stuck? Watch out. - No, don't. - Why not? Not like that. You want to break it, and then it'll stay open forever? - Of course not. - Let's go to town and find a locksmith. Fine, let's do that. Hey. Aren't you coming? Yeah, sure. Whatever the princess wants. - Hey. - Hi. You OK? - Yeah. How did it go? - Fine, they're here. - Look. - Grab the tools and go. How are you doing? I'll show you. Yes. Look. I don't know what's wrong. - See? It won't go in any further. - Let me see. - You want the key? - Yes. Wax. Wax? What is this, Carmen? What, babe? This is really scary. That's my grandmother, you dunce. She's still scary. What's with this painting? I don't know how long it's been since I last saw her likeness. Do you remember her? Yes. Sometimes, a little. Her cooking was... delicious. I used to pray with her. - No way. - What? - You used to pray? - Sure. Come on, Julian. - You prayed? - Yes, I did. Obviously, it's empty. How long has this place been uninhabited? I have no idea. I suppose my mom used to come here... before she got sick. Babe, it'll be fine. - Stop it. - What? Just stop. I'm going to look for some kind of store. Get some coffee! You were ugly when you were little. Shut up! Hey, hey, stop, stop. Did Tomasa come out when you got here? No, I didn't see her. Wasn't she with you? Oh shit, not again. What? Maybe she's chasing a squirrel or something. Tomasa! If she's not back soon we'll look for her. I brought you some apples. - Need help? - Yeah. - Is everything OK? - Yes. Tomasa! Come here! Come here, sweetie! Tomasa! Tomasa! Hey. Don't leave everything lying around. Where should I put it? I don't know, in your bag or something. Fold it. Listen, why don't you relax a bit? Am I bothering you? - You wanna try? - What? For a baby. - No. - What? I don't want to try for a baby right now. I don't know when. Aren't we ever going to try again? I don't want to get excited and then be let down again. You don't know how that feels. Of course I know how it feels. That's not what I meant. Then what did you mean? Oh, man. It's different for me, Julian. If you say so. Here she comes. - Cheers. - What about you? - No shit?! - Yes! No shit! Are you serious? - How long? - One month. No shit! No shit! - Can we still do it? - Yes, we can. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Hi. - Hi. Anything else? Miss. - Anything else? - No. Ten pesos, please. Hi, Tomasa. Where were you, where were you? Are you hungry? Do you smell the food? Hello? Hello? Darn thing. Hi. - Hey, good morning. - Hi. I left a cup of coffee for you. Yes, I had some. Thanks. - Julian, I'm sorry about last night. - It's all right. - I don't want to make you feel bad. - No. Forget it, will you? It's fine. OK? We'll talk about it later, let's eat now. - This is for you. - I’ll help. What's this? Your newspaper is distributed out here. "My" newspaper? Right. Your article. - Did you read it? - Yes. - They cut it in half. - OK. Do you know what you're going to do now? No, I don't know what I'm going to do now. What troubles you? You can't always have an article on the front page. All right, I'll shut up. There. It's getting late. Where are you going? I have a meeting at 1:00. - Want me to come with you? - No. Call me when you get there? Sure you want to stay here alone? Yeah. Don't let your grandma haunt you. You dunce. - When will you be back? - On Thursday. I love you. I love you too. - You smell. - You smell! So long. And you, take care of your mom. - Drive safe. - I will. Stay here, Tomasa. You're not going anywhere. Come here, come on. Hey, hey! You wanna play? Go get it, Tomasa. Tomasa! BIRTHDAY 1996 - Whose birthday is it? - Carmen's! Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday! Let's sing Happy Birthday. One, two, three, four, five. Let's hear it for her! While we get the candles, let's cheer for Carmen. Happy birthday, dear Carmen. Happy birthday to you. Hurrah!

Michoacan, Mexico, 1889... Hello. Yes, miss? I need your help. - Come with me, please. - Yes. What do you need? To see the priest. - Which one? - The priest. There are many priests here. NO CATECHISM THIS SATURDAY WE WILL RESUME ON THE 19TH. THANK YOU This priest. That's Father Juan. I need to see Father Juan. He doesn't take confessions anymore, he retired a long time ago. I'm not here for confession. I came from Mexico City just to talk to him. Is that possible? - Follow me. - Thank you. What? - Father. - Yes? - Somebody wants to see you. - No, I... I'm tired, I don't want to see anyone. Father Juan is tired, come back another day. Father, I'm Consuelo Farias's granddaughter. Give us some privacy, Camilo. Thank you, Camilo. - Pleased to meet you. - Hello. I'm here to ask you some questions, if you don't mind. How is your mother? My mother passed away recently. I'm so sorry, my child. Thank you. I have a couple of questions for you. - About what? - About my grandmother. Everybody in this town knew your grandmother. Why come to me? I saw the videos of what you did together. What did you see? Everything. What you did with all the townspeople. I'm a journalist, I'm doing a story about my grandmother. I'm here for you to explain those videos. Those videos aren't for viewing! What are they for then? You taped them, my grandmother stored them. Yes, that was a mistake. We recorded them for the Church. I should send them, the Church will know what to do. Look, if you're going to interview me, the least you can do is buy me a cup of coffee. I have a better idea. I'll go to your grandmother's house tomorrow, you give me the videos, make me a cup of coffee, and I'll tell you all about your grandmother. Those videos will be in better hands here, because we don't want them to get out. Is that clear? Yes, loud and clear. I'll give you my number, let me jot it down. That won't be necessary. There were only three lines back then, I still remember the number. Camilo. Excuse me, but I'm old and need to rest. That's quite all right. - See you soon. - Yes, Father? Show Carmen to the door. How do you know my name? Your grandmother only had one granddaughter. "Fear not the dark, for the dark should fear our light." Of course, Father. I'll be waiting for you here, whatever time suits you. See you tomorrow. Fifth session. December, 1992. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, thrust into hell Satan and all evil spirits who wander through the world... - Sugar? - A bit. A bit, a bit? - A bit... - That's fine. - Here's the spoon. - Aren't you having a cup? No, I want to concentrate. I put some napkins over here. Here. Tell me, what have you been up to all these years? Well, as I told you, Father, I'm a journalist. I got married three years ago to a very nice guy named Julian. I hope to introduce him to you soon. Children? No. Not yet. They shall come. But, I don't want to waste your time talking about me. Do you mind if I record the interview? No. I'll try to make my best voice. - Go ahead. - All right. When did you retire from the Church? Weren't we going to talk about your grandmother? Yes. Sorry, I need this information to give my article context. Eighteen years ago. Maybe it's me, or I'm confused... but aren't catholic vows supposed to last a lifetime, Father? Something very important must have happened for the Church to allow you to retire. Vows last a lifetime. But that's not the case with things like physical strength and eyesight. The Church is aware of that. When did you decide to perform exorcisms? Like the saying goes, "people decide, God determines, and the Devil comes and ruins it." With me, that was exactly what happened. Then, you believe in the Devil. Don't you? I know there's a Devil. OK, if that's the case and the Devil does exist, how do you recognize him, Father? Remember the first time you saw the sea? The first time you saw the sea, nobody explained to you that it was the sea, did they? You simply knew that it was the sea. Is there a particular case that impressed you the most, that you recall? The Devil has a huge imagination. Sometimes I'm grateful that he blinded me. He blinded you? The Devil feeds off what he takes from us, what we fear losing. He took my eyesight because I had seen him too many times. I'd like you to elaborate on that. Tell me the story of when you lost your sight. We'd need a pitcher of coffee. So, let's leave that for another day. What about my grandmother? What about her? What did she do? She prayed. That's it? I mean, did she do something specific at the church or during the exorcisms? Yes, your grandmother really liked to help. In the beginning she helped in church, in the choir. But, both her and I felt the calling. It's something you can't refuse. She was a light, Consuelo was a light. My light. Didn't your grandmother teach you to pray? Yes, she taught me some prayers. Show me. "Come in, Lord, sanctify and put Your seal on this house, and upon to each article that is in this home for they are Yours to govern over." "Save us from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence, for the Lord our Christ." Amen. That's a beautiful prayer. It's for the Lord to take care of your house. Well, my health and my doctor say I shouldn't have any more coffee. So, we'll leave the rest for the next session. All right, Father. I think this will give me enough material to begin writing. Listen, I don't want to be a nuisance, but if a question comes up may I call you on the telephone? Yes. FATHER JUAN NAVARRO - Done. - Yes. - Don't forget the tapes. - I'll go fetch them. - Give them to Camilo. - Yes. Child, could I have just a little more coffee? The doctor won't find out, so I'll be fine. Of course, I'll be right back. Thank you. I'll take the tapes out to the car. All right. Thank you. I'll be right in to pour you some more coffee. What are you doing, Father? The door, the door! Over here. What's wrong? - Father. What is it? - It's him. - Are you OK, Father? - Yes. "His memory is much better than I expected." "Consuelo was a light... my light." What's up? How's it going? Fine. Strange... but fine. I just sent the first draft of my next story. Really? What's it about? About my grandmother. OK... I really can't explain over the phone. I'll tell you when you get back. I need to call the office and ask for more time. But don't stay too long, you'll forget how to live in the city. Hurry up and come back. Almost. I have to go. I love you. I love you more. Do you mind if I record the interview? No. I'll try to make my best voice. - Go ahead. - All right. Weren't we going to talk about your grandmother? Yes. Sorry, I need this information to give my article context. Eighteen years ago. Maybe it's me, or I'm confused... but aren't catholic vows supposed to last a lifetime, Father? Something very important must have happened for the Church to allow you to retire. MMM with things like physical strength. MMM The Church is aware of that. When did you decide to perform exorcisms? Like the saying goes, "people decide, God determines, and the Devil comes and ruins it." With me, that was exactly what happened. Then, you believe in the Devil. Don't you? I know there's a Devil. Child, could I have just a little more coffee? The doctor won't find out, so I'll be fine. I'll be right back and give you some more. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be right in to pour you some more coffee. - What are you doing, Father? - The door, the door! Hey kiddo, you're on vacation, aren't you? Coming! Bad Girl, Tomasa! Bad girl! What did you do? Get out. Get out! Stop, Tomasa. Tomasa! Tomasa! SUMMER 1999 Julian. Call me. Babe, I need you to come fetch me. Hurry up. Hello? Carmen, my dear. Darling. You had your baby! Lord Saint Jerome... Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of death. To free the souls that are in sin. Lord Saint Jerome... Careful, Father. You were sent from God to free the souls that are in sin. Are you feeling all right? I'm fine. SUMMER 1999 Summer, 1999. Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation... Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of death. Heavenly immortal Father, free us of all evil. Sit here. Are you all right? Father. I need Camilo to take me to the bus station. Leave us, Camilo. I know how you were blinded. Come, child. Sit down. The Devil always keeps something. He took my sight, he took your grandmother's life, - and from you... - What? Tell me. He's still with you. He's still inside of you. Why didn't you say so? Forgive me. I won't run anymore. And neither will you. Come on, come on. Don't be scared, Carmen. Don't be scared. Your eyes! He only did it so I can see him again. Forgive me. Carmen! - You have to help me. - No. Yes. Come on. No, no. Don't be afraid. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. I summon help in the name of the Lord creator of Heaven and earth. The Lord shall deliver me from every ancient evil work, the Lord creator will perform rites and expel you from this house. - Grandmother! - No, no. I don't want to. Don't be scared, he feeds on your fear. Come on. Calm down, Carmen. It's all right, I'm here to protect you. Come in. Help me. Carmen. Did you miss me, blind man? Did you? Don't step back. You're infertile, rotten! Go away, Satan! Why didn't you help me? I'm going to take it from you again. Enter Lord, into this home and make our hearts your soil. Carmen! "Come in, Lord, sanctify and put your seal on this house, and upon to each article..." "Fear not the dark." I'm going to take him from you... again. No! Do you think it's my fault that we lose them? - Are you all right? - Yes. You're not my grandmother! Get out of me! HOLY BIBLE NEW TESTAMENT Fear not the dark, for the dark should fear our light. -Father Juan
