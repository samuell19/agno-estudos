We got the India job? I just got the call. We're about to build the most fabulous boutique hotel that Mumbai as ever seen. Yeah, baby! Nice job! Why, thank you, thank you! Ha. And here is your model back. Ha! Thank you! I told you, bringing this would make all the difference. Well, I think the schematic would have been fine on their own. Nobody really uses models anymore. Looking at a design on a computer is not the same thing as feeling it in your hands. A model conveys a sense of depth, of texture, of dimension. You know how I feel about this, Alex. I do, I do. Which is why I lovingly sat on the plane with this in my lap for twenty hours. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh! I also brought you a little something back from Mumbai. How thoughtful of you. I can't have my partner not having a souvenir from my most exotic location. And it's all handmade. Ha! It's beautiful! I love it! Thank you! You're welcome. - Can you do lunch? - You know I would love to, but I'm super pressed for time. I leave again in a few hours. That's right, Christmas in Switzerland this year! You jet-setter! Ha! I am so exited! I can't wait to see my family and spend the holidays with them. I still can't believe your mum decided to purchase an inn there. What even possessed her? Well, you know, her parents grew up in Switzerland, so she still got a lot of family there, and I think after my dad died, she was looking to reconnect with her roots. She's inspiring. She always says never too late to start a new adventure. Haha! I can see where you get it from! So, when's the big grand opening of the inn? Ha! It's gonna be on New Year's Day. My mum said she wanted to have the perfect family Christmas before the grand opening, so... Well, have a wonderful Christmas! You too. Have such a great trip! I will. Alright! I will see you when I get back. Have a safe flight! Louis, have you thought about the Swiss canapés? We need fresh salmon. Hmm, mum. Salmon, rucola, cucumber... - Ha! Mum. - Yes, what is it? Ha! Did you talk to Alex? - About what? - About Beth and Jesse. Ha! They need to mend fences. They've been best friends since they were two. I know, but it's not that simple. Alex's best friend is now in a relationship with her ex. I understand that, but I need to help them mend, and bringing them together is a good start. Okay. If you think that's a good idea. Trust your mother. Louis, did you hear what I said about the canapés? Hum! Danke. Ha! - Ha! You're here! - Hahaha! Andy, Alex is here! Get over here, you! - Ha! - Oh! I missed you! I missed you too, mum! Good to see you! Hey, sis! Long time no see! Hey! Andy, how are you? Hi, Linds! Good to see you! Oh, my Noah! You're so big! - Hey, aunt Alex. - Hey, buddy! Wow, mum! Ha! Look at this! This is incredible! You think so? Ha! It's hard to believe it's really happening. Oh! Mum, it's beautiful. I'm so proud of you. Thank you, sweetheart. You want me to show you your room? - Wow! Such service. - Well, maybe if this whole Doctor's Without Borders thing doesn't work out, I can ask mum for a job. You know, you're always welcome to work for me, son. You too, Linds. Hum! I think I'll stick to doctoring. Thanks, Carol. Haha! - She's not very good with customer service. - Hey! - Alright, come on! - Alright. Upstairs? - Yeah. - Okay. Ha! I know, this is going to be so fun! Ha! Willkomme, meine Damen. Okay, where is my brother and what did you do with him? Haha. Look at this place! It's so Christmassy! I love it! Yeah, mum has done a really good job with the place. Yeah. How is she doing? I know Christmas without dad is tough. She seems okay. I think buying this inn, renovating it, it was really good for her. Yeah. At least, it keeps her busy. That and the thousands of cousins she apparently has here. Hahaha. - Thanks for coming. - Of course! Of course! There's no way I'd miss Christmas with all you guys. Yeah. It'll be nice to spend the holidays together as a family. Yeah, it will be. I'm sorry! Get some rest, you're probably jet lagged. - Nah! I'm fine. - No, no, no, take a nap. We'll scrounge up dinner in a few hours and you can come down whenever you want. Ha! I don't need a nap. I just need to, you know, rest my eyes for a few minutes. It'll perk me right up. Whatever you say. Haha! Ha! Okay. Ha! I'm gonna close my eyes. What time is it? Ha! And I slept all night. Ha! I think I'm gonna like it here. - Oops! - Ha! Oh, my gosh, honey! Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine, mum. You need to be more careful! Oh, my goodness! Oh! Sweetheart, this is Liam, our general manager. He's the one who keeps this place from catching on fire, and my family from going to the hospital. Ha! Oh! Hi, Liam. I'm Alex. Hi, Alex. So great to meet you. Your mum has told me so much about you. Ha! Likewise. Hum! I heard about all your hotel experience. I thought you'd be a little... - Older. - Yeah. Yeah, I get that a lot. Well, we were just about to head into town to get some more things for Christmas and some decorations for the opening. But there is a breakfast bread in the dining room, so why don't you help yourself to that and a cup of coffee. Ha! I could really use a cup of coffee. - Madame! Oh, excuse me! - Louis. There's been a problem with the wine we selected for the opening: it's not good! Ha! Rank! Unacceptable! I found a new vendor, but you and I, we must select a new wine list. Ha! Well, can it wait till this afternoon? I need to go into town. I'm sorry, no, we must order before noon if we want the shipment to arrive on time for the opening. - There's always something. - Hum! Wait, would you be able to go into town with Liam, so I can take care of this? - Oh! Yeah, sure, no problem. - Okay. Oh, it's fine, I can go by myself. Nonsense, no! I mean, they'll be a lot to carry and it'll be quicker with two. Yeah! Yeah, it's totally fine. Ha! Do you have a car? Actually, there are no cars in Wengen. Oh, really? How you guys get around? We walk. The shops are only a few blocks from here. - Haha! - Ha! Okay, then. Lead the way. Bye, mum. Yeah. So, are you from the States too? You don't sound very Swiss. Actually, I was born here in Wengen. Ha! No way! Yeah, my dad took a job in New York when I was nine, so I mostly grew up around there. Ha! And now, you're back here. Actually, I just moved back. I was living in Bern. Ha! I was running the Bern Palace Hotel. Ever heard of it? Ha! Have I heard of the most expensive hotel in all of Europe? Why, yes! Yes, I have. I mean, no offence, but why are you here working for my mum? You could be running some of the best hotels in the world. Your mum is a top-notch boss. Haha! Plus, you know, my parents are here and pretty much all my extended family. So, I just wanted to be close. That's nice. Your mum tells me that you build hotels? I do. I do. I'm an architect. She said you live in Chicago. Your mum, she talks about you a lot. Haha! Well, my apartment is in Chicago, but I travel so much for work, I'm hardly ever there. Oh, we're here. Oh! This is so charming! Charming? It's just a shop. It's charming. Everything in Switzerland is charming. Haha. So, what do you think we're gonna need for the opening? Honestly? I have no clue, I'm terrible at this kind of thing. What? I thought you were in charge of the whole operation. No, I'm good at financials, making hiring decisions, but event planning, aesthetics, no! No! We just don't have the budget for event planner. Well, I mean, I'm no event planner, but I do know a thing or two about visuals. So, let's see. Ha! Here! What about green and gold for the main colours. And then... Oh! Add a few accents of red! And, huh... ha! Some lights for dimension. Hmm! Candles? I like where your heads at! Alright, throw them in there. See, you're gonna be just fine. I mean, we are gonna need a lot of candles. Huh! Look at these little guys! Those are cute! So, how long are you staying in Wengen? About a week. Then I've gotta fly back home to Chicago to prep a pitch in Australia a couple of weeks after that. - That's a shame you're not staying for the opening. - Yeah. I'm sure you travel a lot. It must be hard to have a personal life, no? Well, yeah. I'm not really looking for that right now anyways, so... What about your friends back home, though, don't you miss seeing them? Yeah, but, you know, the nice thing about travelling all the time is you get to make new friends wherever you go. Well, thank you again for all your help. I must admit, I'm a little out of my depth with this whole opening. Yeah, anytime. Just say the word, I'm happy to help. - Hum. - Hum. Take that. Hum. Hey, you guys! Oh! Rummikub. Yeah. He's kicking my butt. You're not allowed to say butt, dad. - I'm sorry, booty. - Well, I get next game. And warning, I'm good. Ha. I remember. - Hey, where's Linds? - Work emergency. She's talking someone through a tonsillectomy in Madagascar. Oh! Wow! Quite the life you guys lead now. Huh, huh! Hey, how are you liking Madagascar, Noah? I love it! I'm in a whole club about lemurs. Really? Wow, pretty cool. Yeah, it's quite the adventure. Never too late to start one. Wise words from a wise woman. Hahaha. Ha. Andy, what does this mean? Your room in Switzerland awaits. Why would you write that? Ha. Beth and her mum are coming over for Christmas. Mum didn't tell you yet, did she? No! No, mum did not tell me. Mum! Huh, mum, you're... I think we need another case of de Pinot noir. Mum, did you invite Beth and her mum here for Christmas? Of course, I did! Jesse has to work over the holidays, and you know how hard things have been for Nadine since the divorce. I thought it'll be fun for them. I thought we were just gonna have a special family Christmas. Ha! Beth and Nadine are family. We used to spend every Christmas with them. You and Beth were inseparable. Yeah, well that was a long time ago. Things are a little different now. Especially now that Beth and Jesse live together. Ha! Honey, things are only different because you're making them different. It's about time you and Beth made up! It's gonna be a wonderful Christmas, I promise you. I haven't even talk to Beth in over a year. Well, Christmas is a perfect time to reconnect, let bygones be bygones, don't you think? Louis, do we have enough champagne? Ha! One more. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! ♪♪ Chop down the spruce and drag it home ♪ Oh boy! Here we go! ♪ I've got you gifts wrapped in under the tree ♪♪ Ha! Look at you! Hi! You're so big! - Nice! - Thank you! Thank you! This place is amazing! That's delicious. - Just a little bit. - No, please, please... - Ah, you're up! - Look who's here! - Hi! - Ha! Ha! Sweetheart, it's so good to see you! It's been so long! I know, Nadine, it is so good to see you! You know, your mum gives me all your updates and I'm so proud of you. Thank you! How are you holding up with everything? - Ha! Hanging in there, you know. - Yeah. Your mum helps it a lot. Yeah, well, mum's always good for a laugh. Ha! She's the best. - Hey, Alex! - Hey, Beth. - Oh, okay. - Hey. - Hey. - Nice to see you. Alright, everyone! Plenty of food to go around, dig in! - Alright. - I definitely need some coffee! Oh, yes, you do. I'll get that for you. - Thanks, mum! - There you go, sweetheart. These are Louis' famous waffles. Oh! They are to die for. French... Oh, oh! - Les gauffres. - Oh! Hum, hum! Okay, look, you guys have fun. I really should head back inside. I gotta lot to do for the opening, so... Don't worry, it won't take long. I always beat Alex by at least a minute. Ha! That's fiction. Well, actually, I have a call soon. Maybe we should play another time? Mum, it's tradition! Yeah, mum, don't ruin this for me! Don't worry, Linds, I'm gotta have this wrapped up very shortly. I'm watching you. - Hey, maybe I'll win. - You won't. Okay! Game on! Ready, set aaaand... go! Ha! - Yeah! Haha! - No! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Yeah! Hey! Ha! Huh! Alright! Ha! Cheater! Cheater! Ha! Scarf! There we go! Alright! Ha, ha, ha! No? Hahaha! This is the year. - Woooooh! - Ha? Hahaha! Thirty seconds. - That's a new record! - How is that even possible?! - Oh, you snooze, you lose! - Nice work, mum! Thanks, bud! Ha! Let's do a rematch, Alex was distracting me. That serves you right, cold flicker! - Yeah! - Congrats, Linds, you won fair and square. Thank you very much. So, did you have enough fun for one day? I just need a little break from everybody. Already? I was gonna maybe sneak off to a little coffee shop or something. Why is that? Well, I like to go to coffee shops in every country that I visit. I feel like you can really learn a lot about a culture from it's coffee. You know that there's more to Switzerland than just our coffee, right? Of course, I know that. I mean, you know... In fact, I can show you around if you want. - Really? - Yeah, I can show you around Switzerland, immerse you in our culture. Especially at Christmas. I mean, Christmas in Switzerland, it's quite unforgettable. Oh! I mean, that sounds amazing, but why would you wanna spend your day doing that? Honestly? Because I could use your help. - With what? - I'm a little underwater with the whole opening of this inn. I'm like an accountant trying to plan a wedding. And you, well, you seem like you're so great with this kind of thing. Oh. Wow! You need my help with the opening? Yeah. So, what do you say? I'll make it worth your while. I will show you parts of Switzerland that the tourists, they never get to see. I think that sounds pretty great. What exactly are we doing? - Well, do you have plans for tonight? - Not that I know of. You remember the park we passed yesterday, Flühboden? Yeah. Yeah. Well, meet me there around five PM. - Okay. - Oh! And bring your nephew, he's gonna love it. - Sounds like a plan. - Okay. I'll see you tonight. Hey! Hey! So, what exactly you guys are doing tonight? Honestly, I'm not really sure. It's a surprise from Liam. A surprise? That sounds cool. Can I come? Oh! He just invited us. Sorry, dad. Okay, well, it better not be too cool, or else I'll be mad I missed it. Nah! You and Linds deserve a night off. You know, drink some eggnog, have some fun. Besides, this way, I get to spend some quality time with my favourite nephew. Yeah, dad, she wants to spend quality time with her favourite nephew. You know, you're her only nephew, right? Oh! Right. That doesn't make it any less true, Noah. It doesn't make it any less true. I'm just saying. Alright! Come on! - Ciao! - Bye! Do you know what we're waiting for? I guess we'll have to see. It's going to start soon. - Hey, Alex! - Hey! Sorry we're late. One of us gets nervous when he meets new people. Haha. No worries. Who's this handsome little guy? Alex, this is my son Kelby. Kelby, this is my friend Alex. - Nice to meet you! - Ha! Yeah! - Her mum owns the inn where I work. - Hum! And this is her nephew Noah. Hi, Kelby. Hi. - Oh, wow! - Yeah! Oh! Okay, so who are these guys? That is Samichlaus. It's like our version of Santa. In Swiss tradition, his arrival marks the beginning of the Christmas season. Well, it was actually supposed to happen last week, but Santa Claus, well, he had an emergency appendectomy. - Oh! Yikes! - Ho! ho! ho! And who's the scary-looking guy? Oh! That is Schmutzli! Santa's sinister sidekick! He's like the Swiss equivalent of getting coal in your stocking. - Huhuh. - But instead of coal, he just chases you around with a broom stick and knocks you on the head! Obviously, we don't... we don't do that anymore. Boop, boop! - Boop, boop! - Oh! Well, that's a good thing. Haha! Samichlaus! - Thanks. - Wow! Awesome! You guys can go wherever you want. Let's go! Can I pet the donkey? So, I didn't know you had a son. Is your wife here too? Ha! I'm not married. I mean I was, but my wife, she passed away two years ago. Oh! Sorry to hear that. It's actually the main reason that we moved back here to Wengen. After my wife she passed, I don't know, it just... it rocked Kelby's world so hard. Both of ours. It's just, uh... I want him to be with his family, find some sort of stability. Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. Oh, here comes Samichalus! Huhuh. Oh! Oh, oh! Oh! Thank you so much! Danke. It looks delicious. I'm gonna go get Noah. I'll be right back. - Okay. - Noah! Be careful! Seriously, how do I make him stop?! - You can't. - Wooo! Wooo! Wooo! Go for the kids, not me! Watch out for Schmutzli! Eins, zweiz, drei, eh? I'm working on my German. - That's very good. - What did you just play? Haha! Oh, that was so much fun! So close! Alright! Hey, guys! Hey! Hey. Let's get all this off. There we go! Hat! Thank you. Mum, dad, look! - Haha! Wow! - Wow! I met Samiclaus and Schmutzli, and there was a donkey with treats! And Schmutzli said he was gonna hit me with his broom! Well, excuse me? Don't worry, they don't actually do that anymore. Oh! Oh, I didn't mean to interrupt your game. You're not. You should join, we just started. Uh, not... You know, Rummikub is not really my thing. What? I thought you said you were really good at it. Right. Yeah. Thanks for that, Andy. That my place. I gotta go put this guy to bed anyways. Mum, I don't want to. No, no, no, come on, come one! It's way past your bedtime. Let's go. Let's go. Sorry, buddy, I didn't mean to keep you out too late. - Sorry. - Good night. Why don't you grab a seat. Okay. So, where's mum and Nadine? Oh, they're around here somewhere. Drinking mulled wine, reminiscing about old times. You get those two together, they're like two giggling schoolgirls. It's sweet, they've been best friends since they were kids. It's nice they still have each other. Yeah. So, whose turn is it? Oh, uh, it's mine. Ha! Hmm. What do you think? I think your plan might be working. Oh, I hope so. I don't see them talking much. It's a start. You know, I never thought putting Beth and Alex in a room together would work, but I give you credit for pushing it. - I just hope that's all it takes. - Ha. Ha. - Hey, partner! - Hey, world traveller! I Just wanted to catch you before it got too late over there. Oh! It's fine, I'm up late and I'm still adjusting to the time anyway. How are things going at the mothership? Well, actually, an interesting opportunity just came up. Oh! Really? Do tell. How would you feel about pitching for a fishing lodge in Argentina right after Christmas? Of course! I'd love to! Well, are you sure you don't wanna take it, though? I know, you know, you've been wanting to go somewhere warm. Nah, you take it. I know you've always wanted to go to Argentina. Besides, I have plenty to catch up on here. Have fun! Oh! Thank you, Maya. So, I'll send you the preliminary schematic I came up with. Oh! And I'm mailing you some model-making materials. I wasn't sure if they sold that kind of stuff up there. It'll be fine, the schematics are all I need. Alex, you know how I feel about models. Yes, I know. I know: texture, depth, yadi yada. Okay, fine, I'll build it. Good, cause I had them sent express and you should be getting them in two days. Of course you did! Alright! Thank you, Maya! Have a good Christmas, okay? Yes, merry Christmas to you. Bye! Bye! Ha. Well, hello there! Hi. Alex. Guten morgen. Guten morgen to you too. So, all this is for the opening? Yeah. I thought maybe we could do it outside, you know. That way we could do some activities for the kids. We wouldn't have to worry about space. Oh, yeah! That is an excellent idea. See, you know what you're doing, you don't need my help. Actually, I could use your help for the pastry tasting for the party. Honestly, I could do it myself, but I'm not very discerning when it comes to bread. - Oh! Well, I will never say no to food. - Well, that is great because Louis has baked us quite the spread. Fantastic. Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm! Oh, my goodness! This is delicious. What is this? It's a Baumstriezel. Chimney cake. - Huhuh. - It's my specialty. Oh! Well, I will just be taking all of these for myself then, thank you! You gotta try this pain d'épice. Oh! Aw! Louis, you are a genius. Oh! A genius, genius, I don't know! Gifted perhaps, but a genius... Maybe! He's amazing! You know, here at the Christmas market in Wengen, we have tons of delicious food just like this. Oh! A Christmas market! Like the one in Chicago. Well, actually they take their cues from us. Here you can experience the real thing. You... You wanna go tonight? It's at the same park we were the other night. Or you had too much Swiss culture for one day? Well, if you are referring to the delicious cake that I've been eating for breakfast, I don't think I could ever have enough Swiss culture! - Good. - Hey, what are you guys doing? Oh, is that panettone? Oh! Mum used to make this. Don't mind if I do. Hmm! Hmm! It is amazing! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! We're taste testing here. That's what I'm doing, tasting and testing. - Huh! - And you, my good sir, that passed with flying colours. Bravo! Merci. We were just talking about going to the Christmas market. Ha. That would be totally fun. Yeah, I would totally come! Yeah, well, we didn't really invite you, so... Oh! The more the merrier. Everybody should come. - Yeah! Hey, mum! - Huh? Alex and Liam invited us to the Christmas market. You should come. Oh, that is a great idea! And I'm sure Nadine and Beth would love to join us. You know, it wasn't really going to be a group thing. Oh, is this lebkuchen? Ha! Oh, it's so good! Oh, this is gonna be so much fun! I have not been to the Christmas market since I was a little girl. You guys are gonna love it. I'm so glad we're all doing this together. Ha. This was such a great idea, Alex. Yeah, very sweet of you to organise all this. Oh, yeah. Well, it's gonna be so much fun. Thanks. Wow! This place is magical. It's like a storybook. It's just our way of life. Well, it's a pretty good one. Can I get some chestnuts, Dad? Sure you can. Listen, I want you to share with Noah, okay? - Okay. - Okay. You go, go, go. I'll try some of this. - Noah! - Hey! - Let's go get some chestnuts. - Okay. Let's go Hum! Oh! Come and have a look! Ha! Oh, can we see that one, please? Look, it's a Schmutzli candle. - Oh! - Yes! Thank you! Ha! - Isn't that lovely? - Wow! It's beautiful! Danke schoen. Hey, Alex? I'll be right there. Hi. The guy at the booth gave me an extra, you want it? It's called Glühwein. Spicy Christmas wine. Nah, I'm good, thanks. Are you sure? It's just gonna go to waste. Okay, sure, why not? Thanks. Hey, what is this?! It's candle making. You wanna try? We can make our own candles? We have to! Do you remember how much we used to love Christmas crafts? - Yeah. Yeah, I do. - How does it works? Well, first you choose a wick and then you dip it in the wax. Pretty simple. But there are so many colours. Alex, red, your favourite. Yeah, you can mix and match. Just make sure you dip the candle in the cold water to cool enough before you put the next layer. What do you do with all the candles when you're done? Well, most people here use them for their Advent calendars. You put four candles in a wreath and light one every Sunday until Christmas. Oh, we should buy a wreath here! Do you remember we used to make Advent calendars out of felt? Yeah, till Andy started using them as dart boards. Oh, that's right! He really messed up the chocolates inside. You know, Andy was so annoying. - Hey, I heard that. - Oh, good! Then, I don't have to say it again. Oh, come on, you guys loved my high jinks when we were kids. - Ha. Sure we did - Not exactly. Okay, fine, they like the attention. - Oh! - Hmm! Did we? - Oh, whatever, you're dripping. - Oh, ha! Hot, hot! Ow! Hahaha! Thank you. I blame you. Hahaha! Let's stick with the Christmas wine. Did you have a good time, Noah? Oh! So pretty! Kelby. Ha! Alright! Well, I better take this guy home before I gotta carry him home. Yeah. Thanks for taking us all out to the market tonight. It was really fun. I think everyone enjoyed themselves. It's nice to see my mum having some fun. The last couple of years have been really hard since my dad died, so... I can relate. - Hum. - I had a lot of fun tonight too. Here's your candle. Maybe you wanna put on your wreath. You're sure you don't wanna come and do that? No, you should do it. I'm gonna take this guy home! Haha! Alright. Good night Bye. Okay, here we gooo! Good night, Kelby! So, let's see, we've had two Sundays so far, right? That's right. And then tomorrow, we get to light the third candle. Then, just eight days till Christmas. Wow! Yeah! Thanks, mum! It's good. Ha! It's a beautiful tradition. Ha. Sorry, it's Jesse. Hey! How is it going? It's good. Sorry I didn't call sooner. I get it, you're busy. We miss you. You should see this place, it's amazing. Sorry I'm gonna miss it. I can't believe the trial's going all the way through the holidays. Can't you take some days off? The hours you put in... It feels like you should have a lot. Yeah, sorry, it doesn't work like that. I gotta do what I'm told. Okay, I get it. I love you. I love you too. I'll try to Facetime on Christmas Day, okay? Sounds good. Bye! Okay, bye. Doesn't it look pretty? That's so pretty! Just wait till you see what he has for tomorrow. - Hey! Morning, Liam. - Morning. Hey, Alex! - Morning. - Hi, honey. Hey, we were thinking of doing a girl ski day today. Just the four of us, like old times. What do you say? You know, honestly, I'm a little tired from last night. Come on, it'll be fun. Do you remember when we used to ditch them on the mountain because they were so slow and they called ski patrol on us because they thought we were missing? Ha, no, no, no! We called ski patrol on you to teach you a lesson about ditching your mums, not because we thought that you were missing. - Exactly. - Hahaha! There's a rental place right down the street. We could even do a half-day, so you can have a nice lazy morning if you want. What do you say? I mean, it'll be so much fun, there's no reason to say no! That is great! I just don't wanna go. Okay? Uh, I'm sorry, I'm just a little stressed with everything there is to do for the opening, so maybe another day. Yeah, sure, sounds good. Anything we can do to help? No, I got it, thanks. Uh, I hope to hear all about it later, though. Hey. Everything okay? Ha. Not really Beth and I used to be best friends. I mean, since we were born basically. Now, the guy she lives with, Jesse, it's my ex-boyfriend. And? And Jesse was my first love. He broke my heart. And then, like six months later, they were dating, so... Oof. Yeah. Why, are you still in love with this Jesse guy? No! No, definitely not. I mean, that was ages ago. So, what's the problem? The problem is that you don't date and steal your best friend's ex-boyfriend. And you don't think that you can forgive her? I want to, you know, I really do. We had so much fun last night. You know, I miss her. So, you're scared to get close again? Yeah. Is that stupid? Of course not. No, no, it's natural. It's just... you know, it's too bad. A whole friendship, all that history down the drain because of a guy? Yeah. Well, you know what? Good riddance. You know, you are travelling all over the world now, you're living life to the fullest. You are happier than everyone, right? Yeah. Totally. Hey, what are you doing tonight? Well, after my little outburst inside, probably nothing. Why don't you come to the coffee shop around six PM? There is something that I wanna show you. Ha. Some more Swiss Christmas culture? Oh, wouldn't you like to know! Hahaha! That's nice. Good job. Thanks. Oh! You guys are making gingerbread men? Yeah. - Nice. - Haha. In France, we call them roule galette. What do you think of mine? I've got raisins for the eyes, a cinnamon drop for the mouth and chocolate chips for the buttons, just like the story. What story, grandma? Ha, you don't know the story of Roule Galette? Oh, sweetheart, well, it's about a gingerbread man who runs away from everybody he's ever encountered because he's afraid of getting hurt. Ha. He's afraid of getting eaten! But one day, he places his trust in a fox, but the fox tricks him and gobbles him up! No! Yes! Well, it sounds like that gingerbread man just shouldn't have trusted anyone. Oh, now that is definitely the wrong lesson here, honey. Hmm. Well, I'm gonna take off. Where're you off to? - I'm going out with Liam. - Oh, nice. Is there something going on between you two? Is this a date? What? No! No, it's not a date! Why would you even ask that? Ha. Mother knows. Well, you are nosy. But no, it's not a date. Geez! Okay, whatever you say. Alright, I'll see you guys later. It's definitely a date. Ha! It's definitely a date. Whatever. Oh, hey! Hey, Alex. You look really pretty. Oh, Thanks. I brought you a most. Oh! Thank you! What is a most? It's kind of like a hot cider. Oh! Okay. Hum! Oh, yummy! Ha. So, uh, what are we waiting for? Oh, well we are patiently awaiting the unveiling of the latest Adventsfenster. - Adventsfenster? - Uhum. It's a town tradition. People here, they decorate their windows at Christmas, then they close the shutters and you can't see them. And then every night in December leading up until Christmas, we all gather around a different window, the shutters open, the decorations are revealed. Oh, I love that. So it's, it's like a literal Advent calendar, but with real windows. Exactly. You know, displays are mostly drawings and paper cut out, but sometimes people go all out. Ha. It's really fun. You know, I really love some of these Swiss traditions. I gotta bring some of them back to the States. It's just a great way to bring the community together. That way, you know, people don't have to celebrate alone at home. We can all celebrate together. Oh! I love that. Oh! It looks like it's about to start, so... Oh, exciting! Oh, it's beautiful! Now, is the sixteen for the sixteenth of December? You got it. Okay. Oh, you know what? It would be so much fun for the inn to do one of these next year. Actually, we're doing one this year on the twenty-fourth, you know. We're the last reveal of the season. Oh! Maybe I can help with the window. Yeah! That would be great because that is still one of the many unfinished items on my to-do list. Oh! Well, maybe Kelby can help too. He would love that. Do you think you can maybe take me around to see some of the other Adventfensters in town, so I can get some inspiration? Of course. Follow me. This one here is one of my personal favourites. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Oh! That's adorable. Actually, this is my house. - Really? - Yeah. It's been in my family for generations. It was one of the first houses built in this town. Ha. I'd love to see the inside, if that's okay. Of course. Wow! Your house is so adorable, Liam! I love it. Thank you. I do have to ask, though, where is your Christmas tree? Well, here in Switzerland, we don't decorate our trees until Christmas Eve. Well, here it's Heiliger Abend. Oh! So that explains why there's not one at the inn, then, either. You know, it's actually really fun for the kids. We keep the trees hidden Heiliger Abend, then we bring it out. We surprise them. Ha! Actually, I was planning a big Heiliger Abend at the inn on the twenty-fourth. You're welcome to join, if you want. Of course! Yeah, I'd love to. So, are you happy you moved back here to Wengen? Yeah. You know, at first, I was a little scared that I might get stiffled. I used to be a lot like you, actually. I travelled all over the world, I was running the world's biggest hotels, meeting VIPs. I think I could have gone along like that forever. Yeah, I'd imagine it would be hard to maintain that lifestyle and be a single parent. Yeah. But honestly, once I learned to slow down, I realized that I've been keeping myself so busy, I didn't even know who I was anymore. Living here, being able to connect with my roots, learning about my family, their past... I mean, Kelby... I mean, he gets to spend so much more time with his grandparents, his grosi and gropi. He just adores them so. Is that where he is tonight? Uhum. And you don't feel like you're missing out on the world living in a small village? Well, I mean, the world is still out there. You know, I can still visit it whenever I want. Yeah. I guess I can ask you the same thing. What do you mean? Well, you spend all your time running away to different countries building these hotels for people who are just also running away. You ever feel like you're missing out? A sense of home or community, or roots? Hum. Well, sometimes, but, I don't know, my mum lives here in Switzerland now and, you know, Andy and his family are in Africa, so... I guess I don't really have roots anymore. Have you ever considered that it's maybe because you never stay put long enough to plant new ones? Touché! Hahaha! But don't you get tired of seeing the same people like day after day? Yeah. But you know, sometimes, I get to meet new and intriguing people. Hum! New intriguing people? Yeah. New and intriguing and kind-hearted. People who love to travel and learn about new cultures. Hum. Ha. Most? Yes, I'd love some. Thanks. Thanks for walking me back. Of course. Anytime. And thanks for taking me to the Adventfester. It was really beautiful. I'm lucky I got to experience it. Well, you know, I care about you, so... You care about me? I do. Well, I guess I should be heading back. - Yeah. - Kelby will be home soon, so... I'll see you in the morning? Yeah, I'll... I'll be here. Good night! Hey, Alex. Hey. What are you doing? I'm just trying to light all three candles since it's Sunday, but the matches got wet or something. It's not working. I think I found a lighter in this drawer the other day. Do you want to... - Yeah. Great. - Let's see. Ha. There you go. Thanks. Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Look, I don't wanna spoil the mument, but can I just say one thing? Something I've wanted to say for a really long time. Uh, yeah. Yeah, what? Jesse and I only started dating after you two broke up, and didn't mean for it to happen, I swear. I... I tried to stop myself from having feelings for him, I really did, but it just got to the point where... I realised I couldn't live without him. Ha! Uh, Alex, Noah was wondering if you'd tuck him in. Yeah. I'll be right there. Hey! Good morning! Good morning, sweetheart. You're in a good mood. Well, it's a beautiful day outside, what can I say? Hum. What are you up to? Actually, I'm gonna go sledding with Liam and Kelby. Oh, Liam! Stop it! You wanna come? - No, no, I'm just getting to the good part of the book. - Alright. Mum? Nadine? Oh, I really wanna get going on this puzzle. Sorry, Alex, but I think my sledding days are behind me. - Uh, Beth? - Huhum. Sorry. Alrighty, then! Well, your guys' lost. Oh, but I can get Louis to pack you a couple of thermoses of Gerstensuppe. Oh! That is an excellent idea. Thanks, mum. Alright! Well, have fun with the puzzle and I'll see you guys later. - Thanks - Bye! - Bye! - Have fun! - Hey, Alex! - Hey! Uh, I'm really sorry we got interrupted last night. I just need to say to you that my absolute worst regret in life is that my relationship with Jesse ruined our friendship. You were like a sister to me and I miss us. Yeah. Beth, I thought long and hard about this and, uh... I just wanna put this behind us. I'm so relieved to hear you saying that! I miss my best friend! Sorry! No! No! No apology needed! Ha! I'm so happy to have you back! Yeah. You're sure you don't wanna come sledding? No. I think it's best that stay back, so you can have fun with Liam and Kelby. Okay. I'll see you later. Let's go! Let's go! Okay, just one second. Let me just get everything ready. Okay, you feel ready? Maybe Alex should come. Oh! Uh, yeah, okay! Sure! Thanks, Kelby. Ha. I haven't done this in decades. Let's see here. Here we go. OK! Don't worry, Alex, I've got you. Oh, good! Good! I feel much safer now, Kelby. Ready? Yeah. Wooh! Woo-hoo! Ha! Wooh! Haaa! Haha! Yeah! Hahaha! Woo-hoo! I'll race you up! Oh, man! I'm old and slow! - I need you to make a triangle like that. - Like this? Like that? Okay. Shush! Hey, Alex! Guete Abend! Guten Abend to you too, Maya! Hey, are you in the office? Go home, spend some time with your family! Don't worry, I'm just here to pick up a few things. How is your storybook Christmas in Switzerland going? Oh! I'm having the best time. I just absolutely love it! Good! In fact, I'm having such a good time that I'm thinking of extending my trip. Plus I really wanna be here for my mum's opening. What about the Agentina pitch? Well, could you do it? I mean, do you mind? I just... I really feel like I need to be here to help my mum and I know you've been itching to go some place warm. Of course, I'm happy to do it. I'm just surprised. I thought Argentina was on top of your bucket list. It is, but, you know, it'll be there next year. This wouldn't happen to have anything to do with the hot guy I noticed in the back of your Instagram story, would it? Haha. I have no idea what you're talking about. - Hum! Sure you don't. - Haha! Enjoy your Swiss romance, Alex. Oh! And don't worry about the model, I can do it. Ha! Thank you, Maya. Eat some fondue for me! I have and will continue to do so. Bye! Bye! Hey! - Ha! - Yeah! Haha! Ha! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Ha! Hahaha! Ha! Woo-hoo! Yeah! This was awesome! Hey, sweetheart. You're off again? Yeah, I'm going to Liam and Kelby's. We're gonna work on the Adventfenster for the inn. Oh! Liam, who you're not dating? Liam, who's a very nice person. Bye, mum. Wow! Kelby, this is looking great! But why is the tree undecorated? - The decorations are here. - Ha! Okay. Would you like some more hot cider? Yeah, I'd love some. - I'll heat up a new batch. - Thanks. Ha! Hum! My mum used to love decorating the Christmas tree. Oh yeah? Did you guys have any other fun holiday traditions? Mum and I used to sing "Silent Night" every Christmas Eve. Oh! Do you get to sing with your dad now? No, he's not really into singing. Oh! It's your mum. Ha! Wow! Your mum seems like she was a really special lady. Do you have any more photos of her? No, I don't know where they are. Hum! What do you do when you wanna remember her? This is my old house. This is my room. And the piano room. This is my room, where she used to read stories to me. - Uhuh. - That's the kitchen, where mum and I used to eat vanilla ice cream. Hum! That's the music room, where she used to play piano and sing. - Well, these are really great drawings, Kelby. - Thanks. It seems like you have a lot of nice memories of your mum and your old house. Do you have anything here that makes you feel closer to her? Not really. I think I'm starting to forget her. Here you go. Fresh hot cider. - Thank you. - Aw! Uhum! And somebody looks like they're ready for bed. No! I can stay up, dad, I promise. Well, how about if we call your grosi to come over and read you some stories while I walk Alex home? Yeah, grosi! Ha! Lucky you, Kelby! Story time! Hahaha! I was so moved by Kelby's drawings of your old house. - It's really sweet. - Haha. I'm surprised about how much he actually remembers. Ha! He seems a little worried about forgetting his mum, now. He said there's not a lot of old photographs around. Well, I mean, we still have them, I just... I don't put them out anymore. Ever since she died, he's just been so devastated by anything that he sees that reminds him of her. He just turns into a puddle of tears. Well, it's been a few years, right? I mean, maybe enough feelings happened that you could start reintroducing some memories? Maybe. He and his mum used to sing on Christmas, right? Yeah. It was their tradition. And he doesn't wanna sing anymore? Well, we couldn't bring the piano with us when we moved back from Bern and I can't carry it to him. Plus the thought of him singing alone on Christmas Eve without his mum, I think it would be too hard on him. Ha. Maybe it's worth a shot, you know. It could be a nice way for him to remember his mum. I just don't wanna force it. You know? I really tried hard to make his life as pain-free as possible. You're a really good dad. Thank you. And thank you for being so great with him. You know, it really means a lot. Of course. I care about you guys. You care about us? I do. Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry, everything is fine. Hmm! I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Good night. Good night. Jesse? Alex! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spy on your date. Oh, no! Uh! It's not a date. He works for my mum. What are you doing here? I thought you had a case that ran through the holidays? I did too, but the judge had a personal emergency, so they postponed it to mid-January. So, I caught the first flight out and here I am. It's really great to see you. Yeah! - Yeah! - You too. Uh, sorry, I'm just a little shocked, I had no idea you were coming. Yeah, I'm not surprised. I booked my ticket less than twenty-four hours ago. I barely had time to tell Beth. Oh! It's... It's nice. It's great, actually, that you're here for Christmas. Yeah. You know, I owe you an apology. I didn't handle things very well. What things? Well, the breakup, for one. I kind of stayed together out of habit. I should have been more honest with you. Yeah. I appreciate that, thank you. But, look, I... I own part of it too, and it's all for the best, right? Yeah. Well, I never meant to hurt you. Thank you. But, uh... when did Beth entered the picture? Oh, that... that was months after. That had nothing to do with us breaking up. She was concerned about how you were gonna take it. She kept saying she didn't wanna hurt you and she's worried about the whole... No, I know. Beth and I talked. We're all good. Good! I'm glad! You know, Beth was telling me how relieved she is to have her friend back. Yeah. - She could never plan a wedding without you. - Uhm? Oh, dang! Uh! She didn't tell you? We're engaged. Hum. No. No, she did not mention that. Uh! Uh! It must be just one more thing that slipped her mind. - Alex... - No, it's fine. Good night, Jesse. I'm sure she would've. You're okay back there? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Oh, nice tree! - Can we decorate it now? - Not till later, bud. Remember, tradition: we do it the night of Christmas Eve. It's not called Christmas Eve, dad, it's called Heiliger Abend. Right, of course. Heiliger "Abeden". Haha. Mum. When were you gonna tell me? What are you referring to? That Beth and Jesse are getting married. You know he's here, right? Yes, I saw him last night. Alex, don't get so worked up, we just... Wait, you knew too? Oh! I can't believe this! Ha! I'll be right back. Alex, stop! Wait, let me talk to you. Look, honey, don't blow this out of proportion! I'm sure Beth was gonna tell you! But you and Andy knew, and you guys weren't gonna say anything? It wasn't our news to share! I'm sorry! I just got to a good place with my best friend, but another secret, I... Oh, honey! Is Alex okay? Yeah. Yeah, she's fine. Things are just a little bit tense with the Christmas preparations. Ha. - That's a cool looking wolf. - Thanks. Hey. Is, uh, everything okay? I heard you talking to your mum. Beth used to be my best friend. But when she started seeing my ex... Things are little different now, so... I just don't know if I can trust her anymore. I hope that you guys can repair things. I don't know. You know, best friends, they're pretty hard to come by. Especially ones that you've known for that long. And you'll never find someone that shares your life, or knows your history like she does. It's not my place, but... don't lose your best friend. Hey! What do you say we get you a Swiss hot chocolate? Sounds good. The stars. That looks good. Ha. Hey! I've got a secret mission for you. - A secret mission? - Uhum. Yeah. You wanna hear what it is? Yeah! Alright! Well, let's go talk about it in the other room so we can keep it a surprise for everyone. Alright? - Okay, let's go. - Okay, let's go. I would love to sing "Silent Night" tonight! Yeah? Okay, well, it's totally up to you and I don't know how to play the piano, but we can play the music on my phone? You think it's okay with my dad? I think, as long as you're happy, your dad will be happy too. Can you sing with me? Of course! I would be honoured! Okay, let's do it! I only know it in English, though. Ha. That's okay, me too, and I think you'll be just fine. My dad will be so surprised! Yeah, I think he's gonna be really surprised too! And we have a big night of celebrating ahead of us. We get to unveil our Adventfenster and celebrate Heiliger Abend! - Yeah! - Yeah! Alright! Hey! Can we talk? Uh! Yeah. Hey, Kelby, why don't you go and finish decorating the tree and I'll be in there in a minute. Okay? And remember, it's a secret. Got it. Well, I'm just hoping he can keep a secret as well as you can. Alex! That's not it, I wanted to tell you as soon as you forgave me, but... What? I just wanted to enjoy the mument. Yeah. But, look, you have to understand how awful it was to hear the news from Jesse instead of from you. I know and I told Jesse I wanted to be the one to tell you, but he just couldn't keep it quiet, he's such a blabbermouth! Ha. Jesse has always been a bit of a blabbermouth from what I recall. I'm sorry, from the bottom of my heart. I know. Come here. I am really happy for you guys, though. Thank you. Now, let's go celebrate some Heiliger Abend. Heiliger Abend! Merry Christmas! Frohe Weihnachten! - Joyeux Noël! - Yeah! - Cheers! - Joyeux Noël! Cheers! Merry Christmas. ♪♪ I don't have any wishes ♪ ♪ I don't even need a tree ♪ ♪ Christmas time will be much better ♪ Louis, come! Come and join us! Oh, no, no! I have a plate in the kitchen, thank you!

I have a very important announcement to make. Ready? Okay! Alright! Here, why don't you get up on the table? Alright, everyone, we have a very special guest performance tonight of "Silent Night" with our wonderful singer, mister Kelby Huber. Do you wanna say anything before you sing, Kelby? Yeah! This is for my mum. Oh! Okay, ready? ♪♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin ♪ ♪ Mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant ♪ ♪ So tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Yeah! Great Job, buddy! Great job, buddy! Thanks, dad! So, who wants to go hunt for presents? - Me! - Me! How could you? Wha... What do you mean? I... I thought you'd love that. I don't understand. I thought everything went great. Kelby had a blast. I told that I didn't think that he was ready. I understand that, and you're a great dad, but you can't be so scared, you know. It's not for you to decide. Kelby is stronger than you think. He can handle this, okay? No, he can't! He can't handle any more loss! And I don't want him to get attached to someone who's gonna one day walk out of his life and he's never gonna see again! Your job is your life! And next month, you're gonna be in Australia or Argentina, or wherever it is you're gonna go! But you won't be here. I didn't mean to... I'm sorry, I know that you're trying to do the right thing, but... but it's complicated. Yeah. I think that I should just leave. Honey, you're okay? Not really. Sweetheart! I'm sorry! Oh! Come here! I just... I don't understand why Liam's so mad at me! Was I that out of line for having Kelby sing? Of course not! You were just trying to help, and you did. Kelby did great. I think Liam is just being protective. But kids are so much more resilient than we parents sometimes think. Ha! I bet this all blows over by morning. You and Liam are gonna be just fine, you'll see. Ha. Maybe it's better if we're not fine. What do you mean? Do you not like Liam? No, of course, I... I really like Liam. I... I like him a lot. Then, what's the problem? What are the chances that this works out? We live half a world apart, we have completely different lives. Oh! Sweetheart, it's early, you don't have to make any serious decisions right now! Well, maybe it's better if I call it off before it gets serious. You want to call it off before you've even have the chance to figure out if you could be something great. What if we are something great? It's only gonna make it that much harder when it doesn't work out. Sweetheart, I know how hard it is to put yourself out there and I know how hard it is to have your heart broken. When your dad passed away, my heart splintered into a million little pieces, but you know what? I'd take that heartbreak all over again if it meant one more minute with your dad. Liam is an amazing man. You are an amazing woman and I just don't want to see either of you throw away your futures because you're so stuck on the past. Yeah. Get some sleep. You'll feel better in the morning. Okay. Ha! Hey! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Although, it doesn't feel very merry. You gonna patch things up with Liam? I don't know. I mean, Liam's entire life is here in Wengen. What am I gonna do, move here? Give up my whole life in Chicago, stop travelling the world and having adventures? First of all, you've only known him for like two weeks. So, maybe slow your roll just a little. Ha! Yeah! And secondly, just because you're with someone, it doesn't mean you have to give up having adventures. And you never know what the future holds. Maybe Liam would move to Chicago. Hmm! Or you both move somewhere else. Look at mum, she moved to Switzerland, opened this inn. Ha! Could you ever imagine she'd do something like this? - No. No, I did not see this one coming. - Hum. It's like mum always says, it's never too late... - To start a new adventure. - Ha! I guess it all comes down to what you want out of your life. Do you wanna keep it safe and never get hurt? Or do you want a life that is as full as it can possibly be? Oh. Besides, what good is an adventure if you have no one to share it with? Yeah. You're right. Hey, Liam. Hey, Alex. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Yeah, thanks. We're just... We're opening some presents. I didn't wanna interrupt, but I just wanted to come by. Uh! I just really wanted to apologise for last night. I'm really sorry. I should have asked you if it was okay for Kelby to sing and I really overstepped my bounds, so... Alex... No, you are his dad, you know, you know him best. And I should've respected that. It's okay. I forgive you. - You do? - Yeah. In fact, I was gonna go and apologise to you today. I overreacted, I'm sorry. I'm still trying to navigate this whole single dad thing. Yeah. Ha, no apology needed, it's okay. By the way, you were totally right. Ha! Kelby was definitely ready to sing again. He's been talking about last night's performance non-stop. Oh! Oh, that's sweet. Yeah, we took out some old photos and we've been reminiscing all morning. And that's because of you, so thank you. You're welcome. Alex, I really care about you and the time that you spent here has just been wonderful. But Kelby, he's getting really attached to you and you're gonna be leaving soon, so... Yeah. I get it. Hahaha! Hey! Merry Christmas, Alex! Merry Christmas, Kelby! Don't you want to come open the presents with us? Oh! Well, uh, you know, I would love to, but I gotta to get back to the inn, so maybe later. Okay. I should... should probably go. Yeah, sure, okay. Bye, Liam. Bye, Alex. I just can't believe it's over. You'll be okay. Promise. Yeah. It's just... I thought he'd think we were worth a shot, you know? Yeah. Ha! It's gonna be really hard to say bye to Kelby. I'm gonna miss that little guy. Maybe you could do something nice for Kelby, give him a parting gift. Yeah, that's a good idea. His mum died, right? Maybe something to remember her by? I think I know just the thing. Would you help me with it? Of course, whatever you need! Okay! Great! Okay! Make sure everyone has a flute for the toast! I've got apple cider for the kids! There you go, sweetheart. Thank you so much! Okay. Are you gonna give Kelby his gift now? Yeah. Yeah, but I got a few things I need to say to Liam first. Will you watch it for me? - Yeah, of course. - Alright. Cheers! Here goes nothing. You got it. Haha! Hey! Hey, Alex. Uh! I... I just wanted to say thank you for everything. This Christmas has been really magical and maybe even a little life changing for me. And I really didn't realise all the things that I was missing in my life until I met you, so thank you. Wow! You're welcome. And I wanted to let you know that I'm gonna be staying in Switzerland for a little while, help my mum out with the inn, maybe put down some roots again a little bit, trying to figure out who I am. Spend more time with the people I love. I promise, though, I will steer clear of you. I'll stay out of your way. I won't be a problem. So, you'll be staying for the opening? Yeah! I mean, you didn't think I'll let you handle this alone, did you? No offence. None taken. I don't know what to say, I... Well, you don't have to say anything. I just didn't want it to come as a surprise. Merry Christmas! Oh! Hey, buddy! Merry Christmas! Are you ready for me to give you your present now? - Yeah! - Yeah? Alright! It's right over there on the table, so come on. What is it? Well... Tam-tadada! It's a model of your old house. - Really? - Uh, uh. I made it from my memory of your drawings. - There's my bedroom. - Yeah. Yeah. And there is your bed and your chairs. And look, even on the bookshelf, there's some tiny little books like your mum used to read to you. - There's a kitchen! - Yeah! There's a kitchen and a freezer. And in the freezer is some vanilla ice cream. - Her favourite. - Uh, uh. And there's a music room with a piano. Where mum and I used to sing together. Yeah. And now, you can sing anytime you want. - Thanks, Alex, I love it. - Ha! You're welcome. I have a present for you too. - You do? - I didn't know that, Kelbs. Noah, come on! Yeah, let's do it! This is amazing. I'm glad you like it. It's you, me and dad. I wanted you to have something to remember us by. Oh. Kelby, I love it! Ha! Thank you. Hey, come one, let's look at the model! Wow! Ha! I had no idea he was gonna do this. You know, I think you were right. About what? I think there might be something here. I don't know what it is or where it's gonna go, but... I'm willing to find out if you are. I'm willing to find out too. Everyone, raise a glass! Welcome to our annual Christmas celebration. A Wengen Chalet tradition for over 75 years! - - Woo-hoo! - Cheers! Hahaha! Woo-hoo! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Woo-hoo! Now, who wants to go sledding? - Me! Me! - Ha! Wonderful! Wait, nobody told me we were going sledding. Well, I wanted to keep it a surprise. You don't need to know everything, honey. Yes, I do. I thought it was a given. Come one, I'll race you there! - Shall we? - Let's go.
