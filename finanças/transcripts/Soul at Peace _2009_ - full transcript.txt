Guys! Guys! Tono! Peter! Marek! Guys, it's been a while. But now you're out, right? - Maria didn't come with you? - The boy's got a cold, he's feverish. This is yours? Can I drive? I haven't touched a steering wheel for five years. What about the course? Did you finish it? Do you have a certificate? Paper like that! All you can do is wipe your ass with it. This young brat turns up. Supposed to prepare us for the exams. He says: Gents, we're here to prepare you for your new life outside. Learn to work with accounts and money - instead of stealing and scamming. - And? I hit him with a book on double-entry bookkeeping right in the Adam's apple. Nobody needs to teach you stealing. Friar, friar, pants on fire Smoke is rising from your wire. Threads will burn without a doubt, Then your ass'll be stickin' out. Do you know what I found out in there? Celibacy is crap, my friends. And you weren't even in for life. Do you jerk off often? Listen, Tono. I'm your friend, but there are things even I never ask you about. Why just a friend? I thought it was best friend. SOUL AT PEACE Shit! Hey there, Shithead. Driver's licence. I don't have it. I don't have it on me. Your ID card, then. You mean you don't know who I am, Shithead? - My name is Rovniak. - Sure, Shithead. That's enough, sir! Your ID and get out of the car. Mr. Rovniak please, can I talk to you for a minute? Is he going to bribe him or has he promised him a promotion? How much did you give him? Don't you want to go home first? I am home. She's been waiting for five years, she can wait a bit longer. Good morning, Father. Praised be Jesus Christ. Forever and ever, amen. God, what kind of music is that? Turn it off! It's all on me! A round of shots for everyone. Hi there, Tono. Hi. Hey there, buddy. Young man... This little guy... look at this squirt. Do you know him? You look great. Cheers! Well, which one of them ratted on me? What do you think? You sure you don't want to come? Come tomorrow morning then. We'll spend some time together. Go! You should relish this alone. Finally! The house looks great. It didn't look so big in the pictures. Don't you want to ask about the boy? He can't wait to finally see his daddy. Welcome home! - Stefan! - Tono! - Well? Shall we have a drink? - Sure. Tono - I'll come tomorrow. - Wait, I'll be right back. Misko, look who's here. Your daddy. I told you he'd come. That's because you didn't let me bring him over. Jail's no place for kids. He'll get used to me. Five brandy harvests are ready for you. Slivovitz is slivovitz! Fifty percent? You made brandy for me, you built my house... You do my wife, too? Did jail turn your brain to shit or what? Who then? - Give it a rest. - Another good friend of mine? Marek? Marek's a priest. That doesn't mean he's got no dick. Listen, stop nagging, will you? Do you know what I learned in there? You can't trust anybody. Not even yourself. Let me tell you something. Maria never even looked at anyone while you were inside. I swear to God. And your old lady? Didn't she mind you being here all the time? Building the house, cutting wood, making brandy... She never said a word to you? Let her try! Is there any money left? Do I owe you anything? - How much? - Forget it for now. Really. How much? I've come up with a perfect scam. What? Are you not interested? I'll tell you something. I don't know how I survived those five years. We could make 300,000 a month. Besides the salary. Two million a year. Fifty - fifty. We'll be even in 18 months. I owe you that much? Didn't you see the house? It's a castle. - What kind of a scam is it? - Are you in? No. So how are you going to pay the money back, then? I'll think of something. But I need it. I can't wait too long. Wait a minute now, you owe me something, too. I know, you went down for me. You did time for me. But also for yourself. Debts paid make good friends. Anyway... think about it. And don't forget: The code is “red rot”. The Eurostory - we all want it to be our story. The world's strongest currency now comes to Slovakia. Where have you been for so long? You haven't even had dinner. Do you know what I've got ready for you? Have a guess. Tonko. I know how you feel. Don't speak. Don't say anything. I missed you so much I could hardly wait to see you. I love you! Do you hear? - What? - Buy a bicycle, mister. A good one. Got brakes too. - I've got no money. - How much have you got? Three hundred, four hundred fifty. That's fine. Come on, children, let's cross the street. Watch out, kids! Are you okay? - Are you blind, you asshole?! - Tomasko, watch your tongue! 32 cubic metres. - Fine timber. - Nice, no rot. So they let you out? They can shut you in, but they've got to let you out. I'm here to see you, Mr. Tomasovsky. I couldn't hire you. Even if I wanted to. But I don't want to. Sign this for me, Jano. Times are bad, there's not enough work. Don't you think you owe me something? I really can't. You were deep in debt. You'd have shit and not a sawmill without all I gave you. Still got your rifle? So? People have seen a big stag at the foot of Grey Hill. - And? - Early in the morning. He disappears at sunrise. Fuck him. They pay big money for venison at the Beech Tree Inn. Do they pay for pigs too? I could shoot you. Go to hell! I'm only trying to help you. - With syrup? - I said beer, not some slop. That's what we drink around here now. Wanna try? He doesn't know what's good. He was gone for too long. That yellow bike outside... Who does it belong to? What about it? Is it yours then? Yeah, and? Where'd you get it? - I bought it. - May I know who from? Why? Come with me. I haven't finished my beer yet. Don't make it more difficult. I'm asking you to come with me. Hey, you! Stop! I bought it from that boy. And maybe you stole it from Javorka and now he stole it from you? Listen here, Shithead. Are you really such a moron or are you just pretending? Call me Shithead one more time, you scumbag, and I swear... Is there a problem, you guys? Official business. Palo, got a minute? Listen, Tono is my best friend, so stop getting at him. Leave him alone and everything'll be OK between the two of us. Alright? Why's everybody making such a fuss about that asshole I can see you're friends. In my position, you've got to be on good terms with the law. Who are they burying? Old Pazitny. He was a real king. He killed two bears. Not two, three. He was a great guy. Yeah. Great guy. - My dad killed four bears. - I heard about it. Thirty poachers were supposedly firing salvoes in the hills at his funeral. Yeah... And you're sitting here like a piece of shit wondering what to do with your life. Your dad wouldn't have hung about. That's why he's been gone for such a long time. And what about you? Got any plans? I'll find something. Where? Tomasovsky kicked you out and Griac only told you about the stag at the foot of Grey Hill. I see the news is spreading real fast. Good information is the key to good business, my friend. You don't even know what it's about. Come to the lower timber stack tomorrow afternoon. Shall we have another shot? You're already loaded. Don't you have enough yet? You can never have enough money. They're about to lower the coffin. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be with thee... - Are you asking for forgiveness? - It never does any harm. What've you done? There's always something that needs to be forgiven. - Did you save the rifle? - Yes. Bring it here. You need to be careful. At least for a while. Bring it here. OK. You take care of the local and especially the district authorities. Buckovsky, he's hard to crack. And what about the Forest Administration? Leave that to me, Mr. Hrabovik. That's no piece of cake, either. Do you know the director? A really unapproachable man. A man of principles, I've heard. We're all of us men of principles, right? He used to sit on the Regional Committee of the Party. The Communist Party? Are you sure? I was there with him. But it's been a long time since then. Those good old times are gone. Can you guarantee that you'll be able to handle it in reasonable time? Mr. Budaj, who can give you any guarantees these days? Well, I can guarantee an interesting commission for your company. The negotiations will be rather costly. Of course you'll bear all the costs. You can't be serious. Well, then... good luck to you, director. And to you too, director. Aren't you going to eat dinner? Where's that thick book on forestry? - The green one? - Yes. Bring it to me. Find red rot and read it for me. - It's in Czech. - Read it in Czech, then. Red root rot fungus causes wood to turn a reddish, reddish-brown to purple colour. See also heterobasidion annosum. - Is that it? - Yeah. Then look for heterobasidion. Heterobasidion annosum root rot. Basidiomycete fungus of the polypore group. It is widespread and causes major damage to the Norway spruce. It turns the wood a reddish brown and damages its technical properties. It completely destroys the wood in the final phase. Aren't you coming to bed? Not yet. It's late. I know it's late. Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Stop! - Where is he? - He's scarpered. Fuck! He almost killed me. Did you recognise him? Was it him? Fuck! Are you feeling better? - What's that going to be? - A dog kennel. - You've got a dog? - No, but I want one. - What kind? - A small one. - A puppy? - No, not a puppy, a doggy. - Little dogs are called puppies. - Really? Little cats are kittens and little dogs puppies. I don't like it. - You don't like what? - Puppy. I like doggy. Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong... Are you coming to church? Daddy... Lord, you are the fountain of all Holiness. May your Spirit be in these gifts to make them holy, so they may become for us the body and blood of Our Lord, Jesus Christ. Before going voluntarily to His death, He took bread and gave thanks. He broke it and gave it to His disciples, saying: Take and eat it. This is my body, which is given for you. Tono? I thought a confession might do me some good. - You want to confess? Come on then. - I don't know. To me, you're still the kid I used to steal pears with and look at the girls. How can I confess to you? Feels weird... It doesn't have to be a confession. We can just talk. But look straight ahead. We were working in a quarry. I was handing matches to an inmate during the cigarette break. He was sitting on a rock close to me. Just like you are now. Suddenly, another inmate came up behind him, holding a big stone. And he smashed his head in. Just like that, without a single word. The guy's forehead cracked open like an egg. He grabbed my hand and squeezed it really hard like a vice. His eyes were big, wet... Slowly, they faded out. Just like when you shoot a doe. A veil comes down over her eyes. And then he dropped my hand. He didn't fall over. He just sat there on the rock, tears running from his dead eyes I never found out why the freak did it. This morning I was aiming at a gorgeous stag. I held my breath, I was just about to fire. He turned his head and I saw his eyes. I fired into the air. That's OK, Tono. Am I still a man? You think a real man is only one that's capable of killing? Don't you want to pray with me? Excuse me... Where do they give out benefits around here? You mean, you want to apply for benefits. - What kind of benefits? - For the unemployed. Unemployment benefits. End of the hall on the right. I'll sell my place in the queue. One hundred crowns. OK, for fifty. - Is this supposed to be you? - Sure. What do you see? Nice, healthy timber. 1,800 per cubic metre. In Slovak crowns. Here. Hold this. And what do you see now? Some red crap. It's red rot. 650 per cubic metre. Max! Is that clear? Well, what's wrong? You gone a bit soft in jail? Why? I was just wondering if you could still manage forty cubic metres a day? Even fifty. Don't be such a wuss. This is no crude theft. It's just a small adjustment. No one will ever find out. Well? When can you start? Tomasovsky said he wouldn't hire me, even if he could. I've got him by the throat. Don't worry about him. Find someone else. Tonko, stop making a fuss. Take this from a good friend. Think about it... OK? I'm leaving. You've got until tonight! No, don't hit me! I don't have the money anymore. I swear. I'll give it back to you. Is this your dog? He's yours, mister. A great dog. Both indoors and outdoors. Everywhere. Special deal to you, mister. A thousand crowns. - How much? - Five hundred. And we're even. You! He'll run away anyway. A doggy! Come on now... on the table? - What are you going to call him? - Doggy, of course. Great name. - Can I get something to eat? - Right away. - Rovniak was here looking for you. - Shithead? What did he want? He asked if you were at home early this morning. I told him... Well, what did you tell him? That you were fulfilling your marital duties. You said the right thing. - Will you have whiskey or brandy? - I'm driving. Mineral water please. Where do we stand with our deal? Well, it's promising. But it's not going to be easy. Lots of people have to raise their hands to approve your project. I reckoned with that. Everyone has a hobby. How much? My guess is that your project would cost some eighty million. With a big return. - You think so? - Yes. A good guess. I've been doing this for some time, so I know how to figure it out. Including the commission. Three to ten percent. There's only commission if the deal's between two private parties. But you're a state administration. If you want we can call it a bribe. But you're the one offering it, Mr. Hrabovik. Don't force me to act like a scumbag. I wouldn't do it, not even if you killed me. Sorry, but... Not anymore. A reformed sinner? An honest thief? Bullshit! You've got to do it, my friend. I already told you... Find yourself another asshole. There's no one else like you. If you don't do it, then you're finished. And I thought we were friends. After all I've done for you... You just drop me in it? Listen... There's a lot at stake here. I really need the money. And I need to screw your friend Peter. And that's gonna cost a bit. What's Peter got to do with this? He sticks his nose into everything. You've got no idea what he's like. You'd be surprised how well he knows his way around. Now he's after the same thing as me. A real scumbag, that Peter of yours. You're drunk. I know what I'm talking about. And the other one, the Bible-thumper, - is also a real bastard for sure. - Shut up! Some friends you've got! But who helped you out when you were in deep shit? Them? Motherfuckers! That's enough! Get out! You want to kick me out? Of here? Get the fuck out! As you wish. I want the money tomorrow. A million and a half. Tomorrow? Are you nuts? OK then. You've got a week. - Will you have one with me? - Just a drop. Sit over there! That's too much. You're going to need it. Shouldn't you go to bed? What did he want? Last winter, I got into a fight. I ended up in hospital beaten to a pulp. A doctor came to me - a young lad. Says, I'm all cured. And then suddenly he asks, do I know I've got hypoplasia of the testicles. I asked if it was because I was kicked. But he said I was born like that. I can get it up. But I can't have kids. Ever. Who's Michal's father then? I've got to know. I'll never tell you. Even if you killed me. I can't tell you. And I don't want to talk about it! Ever. Kick me out if you want. Or kill me. But don't ever ask me about it again! Go away! Jump, Doggy! Come on! Tono! Are you leaving? He listens to me, doesn't he, dad? You've always loved raspberry brandy. So I brought you some... raspberry brandy. The glasses are over there. How much? A million and a half. When? Can it be by Friday? And today's Wednesday? But I want to know what it's for, Tono. Well, that's clear. Can I smoke here? Are you hungry? It had to be done that way. Because my property, my car, my parents' house, everything was repossessed. And I'll be paying it back all my life long. Almost five million. I know. I was at the court hearing. So why are you surprised? I'll tell you what I don't understand. That you had your new house registered in Stefan's name. Did he show you any invoices? So he just said that you owe him a million and a half and you give him one and a half million? What if he'd wanted two? I trust Stefan. How did you do it anyway? You stole the timber and he sold it? And how did he pay you? He put my share in the bank. He always told me how much I had. And when I wanted something, let's say a car, he gave me as much as I wanted. - How much did he sell the timber for? - That was his business. Well, I'll be damned. What's your problem with him? When they locked me up, and took my house, he promised to build me a new one. And he did. And he gave Maria all the money she needed. He did. Not you or Marek. I asked you at every visit if you needed anything. You said no. And even Marek offered help to Maria. Especially when the boy was born. She refused. Exactly. Because Stefan was already helping her. And now that great friend of yours wants a million and a half from you? Does he not know what kind of fix you're in? He's offering me the chance to make a load of money. Sure! And when you're back inside again, he'll be loaded. That is why I need you to lend me the money. - Do you have a bank account? - Me? Or Stefan. I don't want him to know it's from you. Give us some money for milk for the kids. God will repay you. Wanna buy some slivovitz? I've got slivovitz. It's really good. How much have you got? - Fifty litres. - A hundred a litre? - Two hundred. - One fifty. Good morning, Mr. Smejkal. How's life treating you? What do you need, Tono? I'm looking for a job. They won't hire me to work in the forestry. And you're surprised? There's nothing to steal around here. That's right. But there's no work here either. Just look around you. I'm the stationmaster, I'm the engine driver, I'm the conductor and cashier. Apply for benefits. I can give you six thousand a month, no more. Even unemployment benefits would be higher. Yeah, that's true. - What would I do? - Give a hand to Dezo here. - Dezo?! - I have to bring him his lunch here, because those idiots won't let him eat in the pub with me. You too think gypsies have no business being in the pub, don't you? Make no mistake! Dezo is a real expert. He's the only guy in the whole EU who can get our Old Granny moving. What a surprise! Meatloaf! Every single day. Cierny Hron Station. Welcome to Cierny Hron... - Tono, come and have a beer! - Won't you buy one for a friend? Dad! Daddy! Mummy said that Doggy is no name for a dog. That's true. But I don't know any other name for a dog. - Maybe... Rikina? - Rikina, is it a she? Yes. He is a she. OK then. Come, Rikina! - Finally, Peter. - Good evening, mother! - Hi, Tono. - Hi there. - Are you going to eat? - I'm hungry as a wolf. I'll warm it up for you and I'll be right back. Leave it, I’ll have a shot with Tono. Jesus Christ! Do you want me to come with you when you give it to him? But take someone along as a witness. What am I, a kid? Do you want me to sign something? I'm off then. Thank you, my friend. I owe you one. Tono! What's up? Want a piece? Well, what's up? Now we're even! But we're not done yet. Get lost! If there's anything you don't know, just ask me. I'm asking... Wanna have lunch? With me. In the pub? No. Why not? Will you go for lunch with me? Bring it here for me. Come on, we'll have a beer, come on. I don't feel like seeing those morons. As you wish. - Tono's at work. - I came to see you. Make me a coffee. It's up to you how you make him do it. - He won't listen to me anyway. - He has to. Otherwise there'll be trouble! No one's gonna make an idiot of me, got it? - Maria! - I have to go to kindergarten. Can't you do anything around here without booze? Sure you can, but it's nicer this way. But I'm driving. - Are you afraid of Shithead? - But only one. - Here's to your sports complex. - So, what does it look like here? - Here? Good. It'll be a big boost for the village. Bring in a lot of money. So no one will vote against it. You think so? - Maybe Tomasovsky. - Why Tomasovsky? I've got a feeling someone else has his sights set on that land. And what if Tono tried to vet Stefan? Stefan? You really don't know who your true best friend is? What I've already done for you... And what I'll still do. Look, at some point this village will be mine. And yours, because you're like a brother to me. One year, Tono, just one year, and we'll be set up for life. What I gave you is not enough? That's not even half of what I need. You know what? Screw your scams. Do whatever you want, but without me. OK? - Forget I ever existed. - Who do you think you are? That you're suddenly going to be a saint? Like that hypocrite friend of yours who screws around with nuns? Or the scam artist who wants to rake in everything? The Holy Trinity! The whoremonger, the swindler and the gypsy's flunkey! Time to see sense! Be a man! But now seriously. The last word. Go to hell. I'm going for lunch, mayor. And what about Buckovsky? Listen, Jano. This is my project and I'm going to finish it. Even if... I don't know. I'll just finish it. May I ask what Buckovsky's getting? Nothing. Wait a minute. Come here. Come, take a look. If you want, we can call it a bribe. But you're the one offering it, Mr. Hrabovik. How much do you want? - 6 %. - Mr. Buckovsky! - Mr. Hrabovik... - Shit, how did you record it? - On this computer. - And you can do that? - You can do anything. - Buckovsky's in deep shit then. - In really deep shit. - We have to drink to that. - We seriously have to. You're gonna pack your stuff today and leave my house. Because I'm gonna sell the house. - What? - Is it registered in my name? It is. And I need the money. - Stefan, don't mess with me. - You brought it on yourself. You don't stand a chance. Just try and go against me I'll let Shithead know and tomorrow you're back in jail. Pack your stuff and get out of there. You and that Virgin Mary of yours. And the little bastard. Man overboard! Did you see anything? Because I didn't. And shovel more coal in, will you? Maria? How much have you got in here? One hundred and fifty litres? Two hundred? They're going to get your ass for this. As an ex-convict, you'll get at least two years. Do you have a search warrant? Without a warrant, you have ho right to be in my house. Your house? You're wrong. This isn't your house. If the house is not mine, then the cellar isn't mine, either. Or the two hundred litres. You've got nothing on me. Fuck off, Shithead. Well? Does it hurt? - My friend... - Get lost! You'll sign over my house to Peter tomorrow. And what if I don't? I'll go to the district authorities and tell them the truth. - Tono, you wouldn't do that... - What? Turn you in?! You know what I learned inside? That it's OK to shop a rat. And it's also OK to kill him. It's called hypoplasia of the testicles. I think it's spelled with an. So I have a bastard at home. Christ, what a great c.v.! I'm broke, an ex-convict and I work as a gypsy's aide. I was ratted on and ripped off by the man I covered for. My wife screwed around and brought me a bastard. I've only got blanks instead of balls in my pants... And I can't even bag a fucking deer. What about you? I don't know, Tono. It really pisses me off. That makes two of us. Let's change the subject. And eat something, or you'll be off your head. You must drink with me today. You have to! - Tono? - Let's drink. Here, have some bread. There's still something I want to tell you. What? That God works in mysterious ways? That too. Just don't forget you're not and never will be alone. You've got the two of us. Best friends? Tono... Do you know what's the worst thing of all? Inside here... I'm totally empty. Sit down. It was Stefan, right...? You were in the woods when he came and said he'd turn you in and you'd go to jail if I resisted. He turned me in anyway. Was it him? You can go now... Do you think I should beg for your forgiveness? But there's nothing I need to apologise for. Who then? Me? Not me. English subtitles edited by D. Shearman
