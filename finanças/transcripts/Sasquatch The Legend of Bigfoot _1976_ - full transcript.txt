(dramatic operatic music) (dramatic music) (siren blaring) (bird screeching) (tense music) (leaves rustling) (hawk screeching) (Sasquatch roaring) - [Narrator] For over 200 years, there have been reports of giant man-like creatures roaming the vast mountain regions of the Pacific Northwest in Canada. Hundreds of people have encountered these creatures the Indians call Sasquatch. In 1958, newspapers began to publish these stories in which the press called these creatures Bigfoot. And by the early 1960s, the first full-scale expeditions were underway. Bigfoot was attracting national attention, and was now rapidly becoming the most intriguing mystery on the North American continent. The most significant find to date is the famous Roger Patterson film taken in 1967. Patterson searched for Sasquatch for years. We examined the individual frames of this film, and have come to the conclusion that the film and the creature are authentic; The first pictures ever taken of a Sasquatch. This film gained international attention, and with it, came the most comprehensive research effort ever undertaken. Under the supervision of North American Wildlife Research Center, investigators began feeding data into computers. After months of computerized research on behavioral patterns, migratory movement, and eyewitness descriptions, the computer began answering the many questions surrounding these mysterious creatures. By programming information from hundreds of sightings, the computer drew us a picture of Bigfoot. It corresponded with the Patterson film. Researchers have believed that in some remote wilderness where man has never been, these creatures are living in complete solitude. The computers have now pinpointed this area, and here at North American Wildlife Research, we have organized and financed an expedition to search this unexplored area in hopes of capturing a Sasquatch. The final destination of this expedition is north of the river the Indians called the Peckatoe, in a primitive part of northern British Columbia. We are taking the latest and most sophisticated equipment; Tranquilizer guns, electronic gear, and sniper scopes. If we capture a Sasquatch, we will implant a small transmitter, and release the creature so that it can be traced by radio and studied scientifically. (gentle music) - [Chuck] Deep in the hearts of the vast wilderness of the Pacific Northwest and Canada, a legend extends back into the spoken history of the earliest Indian tribes. This legend is about the mysterious giant creatures that inhabit these forests. The description of these creatures by those who have seen them gives one the uneasy feeling that somewhere, roaming free and wild in these deep, dark valleys, is a living, breathing reminder of mankind's prehistoric past. This is the legend of the Sasquatch. Today, this legend continues to be told in the northwest by many responsible people who have reported sightings and encounters with Bigfoot. Because man has never been able to capture a Sasquatch, this creature has become the world's most intriguing mystery. (helicopter blades whirring) To these men, and to me, the Sasquatch is serious business. This is the beginning of one of the most extensive expeditions ever organized to search the rugged uncharted country of British Columbia for Sasquatch. (horses neighing) It is the hope of all of us on this expedition to prove once and for all that the Sasquatch legend is true. I'm Chuck Evans, the leader of this expedition. I'm the chief investigator for the North American Wildlife Research Center. The man I'm talking to is one of the most distinguished anthropologists in the world, and my good friend, Dr. Paul Markham. He's done extensive research into the Bigfoot phenomena, and he's now one of the leading authorities on Sasquatch. He has helped plan and outfit this expedition, and he's organized this base camp. We are now in the last phases of our preparations, and hope to shove off sometime this morning. Hank! When did you get in? - Oh, we got in yesterday. Had quite a trip a little in. - [Chuck] Hank Parshall is an Idaho rancher, and one of the country's leading experts on tracking dogs. Because of his keen interest in Sasquatch, he has volunteered his horses, dogs, and time for this expedition. Hank first heard of Sasquatch when he was a small boy, and throughout his life, he's talked to many people who have claimed to have seen one. One of the most colorful characters of this expedition is Joshua Aloysius Bigsby. Josh has been a fixture around the Northwest since the turn of the century. He claims to be at least 80 years old, but no one knows for sure. Not even Josh himself. He's probably the last of the mountain men. He knows every trail in these mountains, and so does his faithful mule, Zeb. Josh is important to this expedition, because he is the only one who knows the way to the Peckatoe River. From there, Techka Blackhawk will guide us. - Mr. Evans, thank you. - Your knowledge of the land beyond the Peckatoe River is crucial. It's a relief to have you here. - Well, it's a pleasure to be on this trip. - Have you had a chance to work the dogs? Techka is a graduate from the University of British Columbia and comes from one of the largest Indian tribes in northern Canada. His Indian background and knowledge of the Sasquatch legends make him one of the most critical members of our expedition. And there's Barney Snipe. He's our camp cook. He's a crack shot with a rifle and an excellent woodsman. (horse neighing) (pots clattering) He's a little clumsy, but his coffee isn't bad. - [Barney] Can I get a hand over here? - [Chuck] About to check in? - Bob Vernon, national news service. - Has Dr. Markham gotten you squared away? - Yes, and that horse Hank Parshall introduced me to kicked me in the knee two seconds after I met him. - I'm glad it wasn't more serious. They tell me that you um, don't see the point of this expedition. - That's right. I don't believe in Bigfoot. I'm here because I'm good at my job, and the pay is good enough to make it all seem practical, if not desirable. I'd much rather be back on the streets in New York City where the enemy is visible, and real, instead of chasing some mythological boogeyman in the woods. - [Paul] Can we see you over at central, Chuck? - [Chuck] Be right there, Paul. Bob Vernon is a reporter for a major news service assigned to do a story on our expedition. Although he's a thorough skeptic, he is an honest writer. But his negative attitude disturbs me. (horses neighing) Hank, are you about ready? - Soon as Dr. Markham finishes packing his last piece of equipment, I'll be ready. - Good, I'll go see if I can give him a hand. In the meantime, go ahead line 'em up. Paul, can I give you a hand? - No thanks, Chuck, I've just about got it. - Now, Hank is ready when you are. - Okay, I'll be ready in a moment. - [Chuck] Vernon, you about ready? - Yeah, I'm ready. Wilderness we're going to can't possibly be as primitive as all these elaborate preparations make it to be. - [Chuck] Well, just hang in there. You may be in for a few surprises. Hey, Josh, move 'em out! Take it easy. Remember, we don't know this place as well as you do. By late morning, the pack train and animals were loaded, and we pulled out, with old Josh leading the way. We are taking the best in equipment and supplies. And I feel especially pleased that Hank is bringing his finest tracking dogs. The dogs are German Shepherds, trained and selected specifically for this expedition. Unlike hounds, they track silent, and will not bark nor betray their presence until their quarry is cornered. (water splashing) We were happy to be on our way, but as the chopper buzzed us a last goodbye, we realized that we were leaving our families and civilization behind. It will be weeks before we are resupplied by parachute. (upbeat music) After the feverish activity of the last week, the first two or three days out into the wilderness seemed a welcome relief. The temperature was a mild 70 degrees in the soft air of early June. The skies were a deep Prussian blue. Everyone had the feeling of oneness with nature. It comes to all who lose themselves in the Pacific Northwest. (water splashing) It was early summer in the high country, the best time of the year. A wolf nurses her pups, until a nosy badger comes too close for comfort. (badger hissing) (wolf barking) ♪ Oh, far, far away ♪ There's where my heart is yearning ever ♪ ♪ There where the old folks stay ♪ ♪ All up and down creation - [Chuck] Ease up, ease up, ease up, ease up. Paul, back it up, fall back over here. Our expedition was scheduled to last until late fall, until we found the habitat of the elusive Sasquatch. We would search for months in this wilderness of British Columbia, checking the valleys, the mountains, and high country, criss-crossing the hundreds of square miles of trackless forests, seeking a trace of these legendary creatures of North America. We rode through this beautiful land of mountains and valleys for the first weeks, camping each night by some mountain stream. (water rushing) We were to pass many beautiful lakes and mountains and cross hundreds of streams. And later... And later there would be a river to cross that none of us would ever forget. (gentle music) By unspoken consent, the journey was quiet as we traveled through the forest. We did not want to advertise our presence. And it was quite an experience to watch the wildlife on every side, as we plunged deeper and deeper into this primitive country. We have been climbing steadily since our departure, and everyone now enjoyed the magnificent scenery that lay in front of us. Well Vernon, have you ever seen anything so beautiful? - [Bob] No, never. I've hiked a lot of trails and climbed some spectacular peaks, but I've never seen-- - Quiet, bring your binoculars. Hey, it's Smokey the Bear. It's the most ornery animal there is. We have to put off somebody up ahead because it might double back on us. - [Bob] Cougars are more dangerous than bears. - Oh, a grizzly is the most dangerous, unpredictable animal there is. A cougar will never attack a man, let's be certain. Oh, they can catch anything else. - [Bob] That bear doesn't look all that mean. - Don't count on the way it looks way up here. You know, a couple of old miner friends of mine were killed right near here by a grizzly. - [Chuck] Well, Bob, are you getting pictures that you like? - Yes. - Okay, you guys. Cheese, salami, and the last of the store-bought bread. - Oh, I don't know, that fricasseed mountain rat we had last night wasn't bad. (men laughing) Whoa! - You get a mountain rat. (men laughing) - Well, I've had worse. I remember back in aught five, what we caught in the back country, nothing to eat except gopher. (spits) You ever had gopher, fellers? Well, t'aint the best in the world, then again, t'aint the worst either. - [Hank] Josh oughta know. - Josh, how far do you figure it is to the Peckatoe? - Well, at the rate we're goin', I'd figure it'd take about three weeks, maybe four. Unless we run across one of them critters. - [Chuck] How many sightings have there been in the area to the east of us, Paul? - I've got one in 1969 and nine in 1972. To the north of us, there have been more than 20. - How can you be sure there are Sasquatch in the area where we're going? - Our computer readout shows there have been numerous sightings in the area north of the Peckatoe. - That particular area of BC has been taboo for my tribe and others, for as long as Indian history goes back. The early white explorers couldn't get anyone to guide them in. - [Paul] Take a look at this map. This area. All dense forest. Running east and west is the Pecaktoe River. All around the perimeter, we show various sightings of Sasquatch. - How large would you estimate that population to be? - [Paul] Oh, there's really no way to tell. We don't have enough information on how the Sasquatch lives. - Josh, show us where we're headed. - [Josh] You see that third range of mountains over there? - [Chuck] Yeah. - [Josh] Well just behind that is the Peckatoe. And just beyond that is the land Indians call Hia Country, or forbidden land. You can't see those mountains from here, but they're there. And so is the critter. (bird cawing) - [Chuck] As we move closer to the crest of the first range of mountains, we started to hit small patches of snow. I worried that our progress might be slowed by glaciers or large snow fields, that we couldn't cross with horses. Josh assured me that we would skirt the dangerous areas. (tense music) (horse neighing) - Get, get! - Hey, what's the matter with these horses? - I don't know. They've just been spooked and suddenly... Whoa, get down. (horse snorting) (cougar growling) (horses neighing) (men shouting) (hoofbeats pounding) (dramatic music) (cougar panting) (dogs barking) (cougar growling) - [Hank] Get down! He's gonna jump! (gun firing) - Good shot, Barney! - I promise, Barney, I'll never badmouth you cooking again. - Hey Barney, where'd you ever learn how to shoot like that? - That's an inheritance of my ol' grandpappy. - [Josh] He's a darn good shot, Barney. - It's too bad we had to kill him. He was a fine-looking animal. But with the taste of packhorse in his mouth, he'd have followed us, and he'd have got one of 'em eventually. What's the damage, Hank? - Well, the horse is all right. Cat didn't cut him too bad. It's a good thing. We needed that packhorse. - Well, we'll rest here for an hour, but we've got to be leaving. We got to be to the next valley by tonight. (geese honking) (frogs croaking) (wolves howling) - Hey, Josh. You ever see a Sasquatch? - [Josh] No, not exactly. - What do you mean not exactly? - Well, I've seen a heap of tracks. Some big ones, some little ones. I remember back in 1912, when we just travel up to a river way with a bunch of fellers, did a bit of huntin'. We stopped to camp for the night. Well, during the night, somethin' snuck into our camp and tore it all to shreds. - Maybe it was a bear. - T'weren't no bear. - How do you know? You didn't actually see it. - Well, I seen the tracks the next mornin'. They was about 18 inches long. No bear has feet that big. - But how many people have you talked to have actually seen a Bigfoot? - A couple dozen maybe. - Do you believe in that Mount St. Helens story? - I sure do. I know old Fred Beck who told me about it. The way old Beck told it to me, he and three other fellers was working a mine back in 1924 called the Vanderwhite Mine. They'd been prospectin', pannin' a little gold up in the Lewis River country. This is near Mount St. Helens for goin' on six years. They was doin' pretty well too. They'd seen a lot of tracks around during the years, and they always just figured them to be tracks of a big Injun, that was still roamin' the hills. On this 'ticular day, one of them come back from town with a new assay. It was a dandy. They discovered a pretty good strike of gold, all things considered. They're all kind of excited, and decide to knock off for the day and celebrate their good fortune. They headed back for the cabin as usual, along an old well-used trail. (tense music) About midway up the trail, they began to hear the sounds of footsteps behind them, and off the sides too. (leaves rustling) They never did see what was in the trees, but somethin' was sure followin' 'em. (leaves rustling) By the time they got back to the cabin, they were pretty scared. Charlie was more scared the others. By the sounds of those footsteps, it seemed to him like there was more than one of them things out there, whatever it was. Well, they decide they'd eat a quick supper and go to bed. They had heard nothing more in the trees and they figured that whatever there was out there had gone away. (tense music) (footsteps pounding) (glass shattering) (men yelling) (rocks pounding) (men yelling and shouting) (guns firing) The attack went on for most of the night. Sometimes it was still. And other times, it increased. (Sasquatch roaring) (guns firing) (men shouting) The rocks kept crashin' down, the cabin kept shakin', and they kept shootin', but they never knew if they hit one of 'em. Well, just before dawn, the attack stopped. All around the cabin were large footprints of the critters. They was over 18 inches long. And there's a ton or two of rocks had been thrown down from the ledge. Fred said the apes had did everything they could to get into the cabin. It was built too solid. To this day, that canyon is called Ape Canyon. Fred always did say it was apes. But the way he described them, it was a lot bigger than apes. - [Bob] That's some story, Josh. - I've heard that same story from a whole lot of people up my way. It's always the same. I'm inclined to believe it's the gospel truth. - Um... We gonna have a guard tonight? - [Hank] Do you think we need one? Hey, don't worry, Bob. I'll set the dogs on both sides of the camp. If anything moves, they'll let us know. - Just thought I'd ask. (water rushing) - [Chuck] Each day on the trail brought a new experience. Hank noticed that Ochoco seemed nervous. A little later, he found out why. (playful music) (bear growling) (raccoon snorting) ♪ After I die ♪ Please bury me ♪ Oh bury me out ♪ On the lone prairie (upbeat music) - [Chuck] When we crested the second mountain range, I realized why Josh had been reluctant to bring outsiders into this spectacular country. It was obvious that this was a wilderness seen by few men, and untouched by any of them. It gave us the feeling that we were visitors in a special land that belonged only to the animals. And I hoped it would be theirs forever. In the past weeks, we had crossed many ridges and valleys, and spent much of our time on small detours, along creek beds, where the soft earth would reveal tracks. But we hadn't found a single track of the evasive Sasquatch. Now we were over 200 miles into the interior. Looking back over the country we came through, it seemed impossible that we had made such good time. It was the fourth of July, and we made camp early. The long, hard hours in the saddle made us appreciate any brief moment of relaxation we could find. But we didn't expect the celebration that was beginning to shape up on a nearby glacier. (playful music) (Barney yelling) (men laughing) (frogs croaking) We had now crossed the last of the big mountains. From here on, it would be a long downhill ride into the canyons of the Peckatoe. (wolves howling) Josh estimated about a week to reach the river, but it had been many years since he had traveled this country, and I had the feeling that... Well, that he was not certain about what might lie between us and the river. (birds chirping) (peaceful music) (bears growling) Watching the grizzly fight reminded us how wild this country really was. (peaceful music) We follow the game trails whenever we could. Some days, we made good speed. Other days, we were slowed by heavy timber. Finally, by the middle of July, we reached the Peckatoe. And across from the raging stream was Sasquatch country. (water rushing) - Out here, why there's more water than I'd ever seen it before. Purty, ain't it? Ever seen it before, Techka? - Before I was a young man. It was a lot further downstream. This is Hia Country. Many of the spirits dwell here. - Can you guide us through that wilderness? - I know the way. All my life, I've known the way. It's been told around the campfires of my people for more generations than I remember. We all know the way, but none go. Once we cross the river, we move with caution. - We better make camp back up in that meadow. Hank, will you look for a better crossing downstream? Techka, take a look around. - Extra toilet paper, everybody, on this stump. - [Bob] Sounds good. Save some for me. (Barney humming) (playful music) (men laughing) Hey, you lousy field varmint! Give me back that food! - [Josh] Go! Go get him, Barney! (Barney laughing) - It's mine tonight! (men laughing and cheering) - Hey, bravo! - Lo, the mighty hunter returneth! (men laughing) (water rushing) - [Chuck] We searched the river for a better crossing site. The best place was just above camp. Techka, I know that you've never been across the Peckatoe, but is there anything at all in those Indian legends that might help us out? I'm afraid that these maps just don't cut it. - Only that the land is more dense and rugged. My grandfather once told me the trees are taller and the meadow grass higher. Could be no trails at all to follow. - I'll take it the goin' will be slow and we'll have a hard time getting the horses through the brush. - Let me see that map, Chuck, my boy. Look at this. Here we are. Now, if you was a Sasquatch livin' in these here parts, wouldn't you rather live down here where these valleys come together, where there's plenty of water and a lot of food, yeah? - Techka? - Most of the legends speak of a valley with three arms. That may well be it. - [Chuck] Well then, that's the way we'll go. We'll cross the river in the morning. - We'll have to cross here. It's a doggone treacherous waterfall just downstream. - We'd better get an early start. I'll ask Barney to rustle us up a cold breakfast. (frogs croaking) - I had Techka bring up the dogs tonight. They're a little restless. Think they got wind of something. - You didn't see the herd of deer that come through the forest, did ya? Well, I was awake at dawn. About eight or 10 deer comes through about 20 feet away. - Come on Josh, the dogs would have picked up the smell on them deer. - Nope. Them deer were too smart. They come downwind of the dogs and made nary a sound passin' by. You fellers remind me of the story Hank was tellin' me about ol' Bauman back in 1850. It was told by none other than Teddy Roosevelt. And he even wrote it down in his book. (men laughing) - I'm not sure I can tell it like Josh could, but he's right. It was it told by Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy spent a lot of time in that wilderness. He was a hard man to fool with a tall tale. And he said the story was told to him by an old weather-beaten hunter by the name of Bauman, I think it was. Well, Bauman had to believe that story, 'cause he, Teddy knows that every time he told it, he couldn't keep from shudderin'. Now, the whole thing happened back in 1850 when Bauman was a young man. Him and his partner was trappin' up in the mountains in Idaho. And not having much luck trappin', Bauman and Jessup, not being superstitious men, decided to go up to a particular small stream that was said to have a lot of beaver. And to get to that stream, they had to travel by way of a pass that, well, it had an evil reputation ever since a year before when a hunter had wandered into it and was killed by some wild beast. Well, Bauman and Jessup, calculatin' that they couldn't get the horses up the pass traveled on foot 'til they reached the beaver swamp, but they decided to camp for the night. Now, there's still a few hours of daylight, so they build a small lean-to and went on up the creek with the traps. Well, settin' the traps took a little longer than they thought, so they didn't get back to the camp 'til late in the evenin'. (frogs croaking) But when they came into the camp, the whole place was just torn up. The lean-to was smashed. Blankets and supplies were just thrown all over the place. (tense music) And all around the camp, there was footprints, just as plain as if they've been made in snow. And they examined the tracks real close and concluded that whatever it was certainly walked on two legs. It was gettin' too dark to tell much, so the two men went on to bed with intentions of studying the tracks in the mornin'. About midnight, Bauman was awakened by some kind of noise. (footsteps pounding) He saw a black shape run across the front of the lean-to. He grabbed his rifle and fired a shot at it. (gun firing) Could not see what it was. All he knew was that it was runnin' fast. Well, after that, both of 'em sat by the fire the rest of the night, keepin' a close watch on that doggone thing. Whatever it was, that thing came back and stood for an hour so in the trees across the swamp. It made some godawful sounds, but it didn't come near the camp. In the morning, they both decided to leave the valley just as soon as they could, so they spent the rest of the morning gathering the traps from the creek, and you know somethin'? Every trap was just plumb empty. And by noon, their fears of the past night just kind of dimmed, even seemed a little bit foolish. So since there was only three traps left, Bauman volunteered to get 'em while Jessup went on into camp to pack up the gear for the departure. (tense music) When Bauman returned to the camp, everything was quiet. He hollered for Jessup. There was no answer. Then, Bauman caught sight of his friend. He was dead. His neck broke, just like it'd been nothin' but a twig. Well, Jessup was dead. There wasn't nothin' Bauman could do but bury him, and there wasn't time to do that before dark, so he just grabbed his pack and headed down to the horses where they was hobbled, and he lit out of there just about as fast as a couple of scared horses could handle. Bauman said as far as he knew, them traps was still up there on the old Salmon River, along with Jessup's bones. - [Bob] Hank, you think that story is true? - I guaran-doggone-tee you, a man like Teddy Roosevelt wouldn't have said nothin' if he didn't believe it. - There are lots of stories on record like that. - Well, I hate to break this up, but I'm gonna have to radio home base for some supplies. - Oh great, I got a list for ya. And don't let 'em forget the Tabasco sauce. - Anyone have anything else they need before I call? - No. - I guess that's all. (playful music) - Come out of there, you varmint! That's Techka's outfit. Come on! Outta there! You guys don't know your own place. Who do you think you are? Come on! Come on! Get outta there! You varmint, you! - [Chuck] We suggest you approach from the east, out of the side, the wind is at five knots. - [Pilot] Roger. - [Chuck] It was good to see the airplane. The arrival of fresh supplies and letters from home lent a nice feeling to the day. It was comforting to know that we had a direct link with civilization. There it is, mail from home. - Yes. - Hey! - [Chuck] We were now almost 300 miles into the interior. Just an hour and a half flight for the plane, but a good month's trek by horseback. (men laughing) - Oh, my Tabasco sauce! (fake crying) Later that morning, we attempted the river crossing. It was just as tough as we had thought, but the rapid flow of the water and the depth of the stream made it extremely hazardous. Hank started across with the packhorses. (water rushing) - [Hank] Whoa! - [Chuck] Everything was going well, until we hit midstream and then-- (water splashing) The river was sweeping horses and riders downstream. (men shouting and whistling) - Ho! (water splashing) - What happened? Oh my God, what? (Barney yelling) - [Chuck] Techka managed to throw Barney a rope, and we pulled him out of the river. (Barney sputtering) - Get him in here! (Barney yelling) (Barney coughing) - Get him up here. You okay? - Everything all right? - Yeah. Oh! - [Chuck] How much water did you swallow there? - Did you get my hat? (men laughing) (Barney coughing) - [Chuck] By late morning, we had all crossed the Peckatoe, dried out, and were back on the trail. (peaceful music) This country north of the river, it seemed different. Even Techka remarked at the change. We noticed that the mornings were cooler, and the sunsets came earlier. The season was changing. This country held a unique fascination for all of us. It was obviously virgin wilderness. (upbeat music) We knew that we might catch sight of a Sasquatch at any time. This knowledge would keep us on the alert from now on. (water trickling) There was an abundance of game everywhere, more than I had ever seen before. And none of the animals seemed afraid of us. Perhaps we were the first men and horses they had ever seen. We continued to travel this way for weeks, looking, searching and watching. We examined every stream bed and checked the soft earth in the meadows. Whenever we'd see a likely-looking meadow, we'd all spread out and look for tracks. When we crossed small streams, Hank would take the dogs and search until he was satisfied that there were no trails or tracks. Because research on Sasquatch had shown that part of their diet consists of plants, Paul Markham spent a lot of his time cataloging the different kinds of forest vegetation. And during the whole trip, I never saw him for long without his ever-present notebook. The going was slow and tough, through heavy timber. Many times, with no trail at all. We began to wonder what had happened to the valleys we had spotted on the maps weeks earlier at the Peckatoe River. Some days, we were hindered by brush so thick that Techka had to cut a trail before the horses could move through. The fear of missing our destination was weighing heavily on us. Even some of the meadows were treacherous. (horse neighing) My horse, Lava, became mired in a meadow bog. For three hours, we worked in the mud, while the mosquitoes worked on us. Lava had given up, so I did the last thing I could think of to save his life. The whipping worked, and Lava made a final lunge and freed himself from the mud. If we had lost him, we would have had to redistribute the equipment. And I wasn't looking forward to riding a packhorse. Strange things began to happen. - [Techka] Watch it! - [Chuck] It was as if someone, or something, was trying to stop our progress. I began to worry. Were these attacks? Or simply a quirk of nature? There was no way to explain it. We were all feeling the strain of the long trip, and Bob Vernon was becoming more cantankerous as each day passed. The wilderness had not changed him as I had hoped. - The horses are a little jumpy. I hobbled them instead of tying 'em up to a picket line. I think we need a guard. - There's nothing to guard against around here, except 300-pound mosquitoes. - Well, then you ought to be able to hit one. - Does that mean it's my turn? - Vernon... That attitude of yours is gonna get somebody killed. - Aye aye, captain. (frogs croaking) (tense music) (wolves howling) (owl hooting) (horses neighing) (frogs croaking) (bear growling) (Bob screaming) Oh, God! (gun firing) - Here he is! Bob! Easy. - Oh my God... - Bob, are you all right? He's bleeding. Barney, get the first-aid kit. - Right. - Hank, Techka, make sure that grizzly's out of here. I'm going to move your arm. Tell me if it hurts, all right? Easy, I'll sit you up here, Bob. - Careful. - Easy does it. Let's get him up off his side. - Watch this arm here. (Bob groaning) - [Chuck] Easy does it. Easy with that. Josh, you got the gauze? - [Josh] Yeah, right here. Well, that ain't too bad. That old grizzly bear didn't hurt you too much. You ought take it easy for a spell now. (Bob groaning) Ooh, careful. It's gonna be a little sore. I think you'll live. Good. - [Chuck] The experience with the grizzly was pretty scary to all of us. And as Josh had warned us weeks earlier, the grizzly is the most dangerous of all big game. Vernon didn't talk much about it. His carelessness had just about cost him his life. And now he would have respect for the wilderness. On the morning of the 10th of September, we broke camp and rode as usual. (tense music) By late morning, a new sensation seemed to engulf the expedition. An unknown presence of danger. It was a feeling of foreboding. The forest around us was vacant of life. The horses were also feeling it and were harder to handle. This uneasiness continued all day. That afternoon, we reached the first valley. After almost three months on the trail, we were now entering the area where the computers had told us a population of Sasquatch might exist. Would this be the place where we would find them? No modern expedition had ever encountered a Sasquatch, except for Roger Patterson's. Perhaps our efforts would be for nothing. (dramatic music) We decided to camp at the edge of the meadow, near the head of the valley. - You want some more beans? - No. - No, thanks. - Hey Barney, we were talking about how to capture a Sasquatch this morning. - Mmhmm? - Well, I thought of a new way. Throw your biscuits at him! (men laughing) - Yeah? Well, you just wait. That old Sasquatch, he's gonna come wandering into this camp askin' for some of my good cookin', and you ain't even gonna have your tranquilizer guns ready. (owl screeching) (Barney yelling) - Barney, watch what you're doin'! - Looks like we got an old owl up in a tree. - Well, that could have been a Sasquatch! It's time you guys got to your lookout stations. Your poor old cook needs protection if he's gonna be cooking these good meals and washin' dishes and doing all the necessities around this camp! - [Chuck] Barney's right. We'd better get ready. - [Barney] What if there are two or three or more? - [Chuck] So much the better, Barney. That'll help our chances with the tranquilizer gun. - [Barney] Yeah, our chances of gettin' killed. - [Bob] Aw, come on Barney, don't be such a coward. (frogs croaking) - [Chuck] Being as big as he is, Sasquatch could break the back of a man with one blow. We've got to consider him smarter and more dangerous than a grizzly bear. And I don't need to tell you about grizzlies. So don't take any chances. - If he comes, he'll come from the thickest part of the forest. Studies show he has a tendency to stay under cover. - That'd be over by post four, where Hank is. - That's right. - Do you think he'll come alone? - Perhaps. - All right, we better move out. (frogs croaking) (dogs whining) I can't seem to shake that eerie feeling that I've had all day. It's like something's been watchin' me. - You won't. That feeling that you and I and all of us have is what the Indian legends speak of when Sasquatch is present in an area. This morning, we entered the domain of Sasquatch. (frogs croaking) (tense music) (wolf howling) (receiver beeping) - [Techka] Chuck? - Yeah, what is it? - [Techka] Something's approaching. Listen, can you hear anything? - No. It's dead quiet. - That's what I mean. Something is approaching, or it's already here. (horses snorting) (Sasquatch roaring) (dogs barking) - [Chuck] Paul, get the horses! (Barney screaming) (horses neighing) (dogs whining) - [Paul] Chuck, they're in the woods! - Paul, over there, get a tranquilizer! Techka, Techka, check in. - [Techka] I checked the forest with a sniper scope. Couldn't see a thing. The Sasquatch was here, all right. I caught his smell on the wind. It's sort of rotting-smelling. - Okay. Keep the channel open. Hank? - [Hank] Yeah, I'm okay. What the heck was that scream? - It had to be a Sasquatch. Nothing else sounds like that. If he gets close enough, put a tranquilizer in him. - [Hank] Don't you worry. - Josh? Josh? Josh, answer me! (Sasquatch roaring) (horses neighing) He must be back in the trees... Where's Josh? (tense music) (Bob laughing) Josh, why didn't you answer? - Couldn't, didn't have this gizmo turned on. Though, I thought I smelt the critter. I thought I'd sneak up on it. Couldn't get near him, though. That Sasquatch could have walked right through this camp with all you fellers asleep. - [Chuck] You didn't see it? - Nah, it was in the trees. He's gone now, though. - Gone? - Just listen. (cricket chirping) The forest sounds are comin' back. - Well, the next time you go traipsing off, let someone know. We thought it might have got you. - Nah, not a chance. Well, I think I'll hit the sack. He won't be back tonight. (cricket chirping) - [Chuck] Most of us were rather tired and sleepy the next morning, although Josh had slept like a baby. The rest of us sure hadn't. It had been a disturbing experience. At the first light of day, we began to cover the meadow to check for tracks. Those screams had been so close, we knew we should find some evidence of what had made them. (bird screeching) - [Techka] The tracks! (tense music) They're about four hours old, made this morning. Look, the edge of the print is still sharp. - After all this time... - [Techka] Here's the other impression. And they're about six feet apart. - [Paul] 16 and a half. Eight and a half at the ball. An inch and a half deep. I estimate the creature to weigh somewhere between eight and 900 pounds. He must have been standing right here, looking down on us last night. - Here's another one! Let's get a cast made of this one. Barney, the resin kit. - [Barney] You bet. - [Hank] I'll see if I can pick up the trail with the dogs. (peaceful music) - [Chuck] We made one cast of each foot. We were using the new resin materials, which took longer to dry than Plaster of Paris, but this substance is practically indestructible. We had finally found our first Bigfoot tracks. Paul was more excited than I had ever seen him. There was no doubt in his mind now, that Sasquatch was a living, breathing creature. Hank and the dogs followed the trail, which led out of the meadow, through some trees, and ended at the base of a steep rock cliff. It looked as if the Sasquatch had climbed right up over the top. It would be impossible for us to follow. Only experienced mountain climbers could get to the top end. And of course, the creature had crossed over by now. Techka had pointed out that the cliff curved in the same direction we were headed. If the Sasquatch continued in a straight line, we might pick up his trail on the other side. We decided that Hank and Techka would walk around with the dogs. We would break camp and meet them with the horses. (wind howling) (horses snorting) Late that afternoon, wind had covered the tracks with dust, and the first of the fall storms was approaching. (wind howling) (horses snorting) For two days, we traveled in heavy rain. And could only hope the rain would not turn to snow. (wind howling) (rain pattering) We stopped for lunch in the trees, but Techka was never still. He roamed the edge of the meadow, looking and searching. - Chuck, more tracks! It's the same pattern. See the resemblance in the print? The ball of the foot has this big lump on the side. It's the same creature. - [Chuck] How old is the track? - [Techka] Two, maybe three hours old. Made this morning for sure. They're heading the same way we are. The dogs can take it from here once we're ready to go. - [Chuck] We were back on the trail, and now, there wasn't any question about the direction the creature was headed. If the Indian legends were correct, we were nearing the heart of Sasquatch country. The storm broke, and we were to enjoy a few warm days of Indian summer. We continued our journey with the ever-present feeling of uneasiness. - [Techka] Whoa. - In the next valley that was the most awesome sight I had ever seen. Recognize those signs, Paul? - [Pau] Yes. That's the way the Sasquatch marks the outer perimeter of his domain. It's incredible. Incredible. - It is as the ancient ones that have said. The Sasquatch are in the place of the three valleys. Form here, we go with danger. - [Chuck] Broken trees at that height indicated a creature that could stand over 10 feet tall and weighed better than 1,000 pounds. It was a frightening realization. The tremendous strength it would have taken to break those trees off so cleanly. And I think we all began to understand the danger we were in. There were no sounds in the forest. It was obvious to all of us that we were now in the heart of the Sasquatch domain. There were tracks everywhere in the soft earth of the meadow, of different sizes and moving in different directions. We reached the third valley. Here, you could feel the presence of Sasquatch. We could catch a faint odor on the wind. The valley opened into a large meadow, surrounded by dense forests, and a lake protected the north entrance. Techka suggested we camp on a knoll above the meadow, near the tree line. It was out of the swampy area, and we would have the lake on one side for protection. (upbeat music) Now our chances for making a capture were better than ever. We had to be ready to take advantage of any opportunity. We set up camp and began rigging the electronic sensing device. It was developed by the Research Center as an alarm system to monitor creature movement in mountain country. Properly set, the console here at camp will tell us the location, speed and direction of an approaching Sasquatch. While josh and I strung the main wire from the console, Markham, Techka and Vernon began setting the perimeter wires on the other side of the lake. The inner perimeter was placed around the edge of the meadow. These wires are so fine, a Sasquatch will not know when he breaks one. The outer perimeter wire was placed 350 yards back in the trees, circling the meadow. These wires were attached to insulators five feet above the ground, high enough for normal animals to pass under, but low enough that a Sasquatch cannot avoid it. Using metal rods, we established gates throughout the perimeter so that when a section of wire is broken, we can pinpoint the creature's location on the console. There were eight gates in each perimeter. Paul, will you check me up in this again? - This is our outer perimeter. We've set it about 300 yards back into the trees. It corresponds with this amber row of lights. This is our inner perimeter. It's about 50 yards away from the end of the meadow. It corresponds to this white row of lights. Any time he moves through any one of these gates, a corresponding light will go on. If he moves into the inner perimeter, he should be close enough for one of our men to get a shot at it. - [Chuck] And if they miss and he keeps on moving, we'll be ready for him right here. - [Paul] Exactly. - [Chuck] We are using the most potent tranquilizer known. Markham recommended we load the darts with twice the amount normally used for grizzly bears. These guns have a range of 70 yards, and will be equipped with sniper scopes. The late afternoon was spent testing the trip gates and checking the guns. By dusk, we were ready. We ate a quiet dinner. The thought of what could happen this night was on everyone's mind. We knew the Sasquatch might come, and with it, our opportunity to capture the greatest anthropological find of all time. (frogs croaking) We wanted to make a capture, but if things got out of hand, we would have to protect ourselves. Hank, Techka and Vernon volunteered to take positions in the inner perimeter. The rest of us stayed to protect the camp. (tense music) (alarm beeping) There it is! Gate four, to the west! Listen, everyone. He's just broken gate four. Hank, that's in your sector. He should be just beyond the edge of the tree line. - [Hank] Gotcha. (alarm beeping) - Hank. Hank, he's moving. He's just broken gate three in sector two. He should be just beyond you, just to the left of you, in the trees. (leaves rustling) (Sasquatch roaring) (tense music) Hank? Are you okay, Hank? - Yeah, yeah. It's just mighty close. Hey, there's one over here by me. - Can you see it? - No. I can't see a thing. - Chuck, he's still circling the meadow. (alarms clicking) - He... He's close. I... I can hear breathing. (alarm beeping) - Heads up, creature's changed directions. he's moving in a semicircle towards the other end of the meadow. (alarm beeping) Techka, there's another creature on your side. He's just broken gate eight. - I can hear him moving, just inside the line of trees. I can't see him... But I can hear him. The sound is coming from near gate seven. (alarms clicking) (Sasquatch roaring) (horses neighing) (leaves rustling) - They're around us... - Vernon? Vernon! There's one in the camp! (men yelling) (objects clattering) (horses neighing) Watch it! (men yelling) (dogs barking) Hank, Techka, get in here fast! (Sasquatch roaring) (objects clattering) (men screaming) (gun firing) (Sasquatch howling) (Sasquatch roaring) (men yelling) (guns firing) Oh, look out! (Sasquatch roaring) (gun firing) (gun clicking) (leaves rustling) Josh! Get the light! (gun clicking) (frogs croaking) - I think he's gone. We can go home. - [Chuck] And it was over. The Sasquatch didn't return. (birds chirping) Our camp and equipment was smashed and ruined. We had several injuries. Barney had a vicious cut on his head, and Markham's knee was shattered. And poor Bob Vernon was in shock. Could you pick up their trail? - Yeah. It wasn't hard. Techka was right, they done took on out of this area. There's a whole lot of tracks leading off to the west. I assume they're movin' real fast. (sighs) We'll never catch 'em now. - It looks... Like we're finished here. (bird screeching) - Chuck, coffee? - Yeah. As soon as we get this mess packed up, we'll move out. Barney... A good cup of coffee. Our equipment was completely destroyed. With the injuries and the fact that winter was approaching, it was imperative that we head back. As we leave the valleys of the Sasquatch, the questions still remain; Are they a unique type of being, neither human nor animal? And how have they managed to exist until now, hidden from the view of man, deep in this wilderness of North America? We had found the habitat of the Sasquatch. Our efforts will provide volumes of information to stimulate preparations for more extensive expeditions. And next spring, when the snows begin to melt in the high country and the Sasquatch return, we might be here too, in the forbidden valleys of the Bigfoot, tracking and studying mankind's greatest mystery. ♪ High in the mountains ♪ There lives a legend few people have seen ♪ ♪ High in the mountains ♪ Strong as a river ♪ Proud as the eagle that flies in the sky ♪ ♪ High in the mountains ♪ Goes through the valleys ♪ That makes the high mountain his home ♪ ♪ There in God's country, he just wants to be left alone ♪ ♪ Wild as the wind ♪ He travels in places where men dare not go ♪ ♪ High in the mountains
