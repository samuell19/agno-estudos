It makes me wanna throw up. [Leslie] Well, you need to stay off the social media because it's all over there these days. - [Giovanni] Exactly. - Yeah, but not from my parents. Oh, you should be glad we're talking about things like this, otherwise you wouldn't be here. - Exactly. - Hmm. Well, I'm 17, and I'm in here, so I don't wanna hear about it anymore. You about to get a baby brother in a minute. Oh, I'm with Angie on that. I don't wanna hear that either. - Oh, stop. - [Angela] Anyway, I still don't understand why you guys didn't let me stay with Heather while you're gone. No offense, Auntie Kris. Hey, you better be glad you're not staying into Grandma's. No offense taken, but I was actually wondering the same thing. It's not like I didn't have any special plans with Martin, and no, they do not include my baby niece. - Hmm. - Oh, gosh. Now you're getting nasty, too, Auntie. What is going on in the world today? [Kristen] You would know with how much - you're always on that phone. - Uh-hmm. - That one. - [Kristen] Anyway you guys, we're gonna let you go. Enjoy your vacation and don't worry. Mwah. You know baby girl is safe with me. We're actually gonna have a movie night. [Leslie] Okay. Well, you guys have fun, and I'm gonna go ahead and call your grandma, so we could check on your baby sister. Okay, mom and dad. Love you guys. - Bye, guys. - Bye. Bye. - I love you, baby. - Bye. You know I was just playing, right? I love spending time with you. Martin is always gonna be there, but you, you're gonna go off to college - in a few months. - Uh-hmm. And you're gonna forget all about me. Oh, gosh, stop being so dramatic. I'm gonna visit every weekend. That's what you say now until you get there. Auntie Kris, can I talk to you about something? You can talk to me about anything, baby girl. It's about college. I don't wanna go. Angie, your parents have worked so hard for you to go. Yeah, I know, and I appreciate them, but it's not something I want. You're 17 years old. You really have no choice. Yeah, I'm always being told that I'm too young to make any decisions for myself. That's not what I mean, Angie. What I mean is, you're gonna be 18 in a couple of months, don't make any drastic decisions right now. Go with the flow of your parents. They love you and they only want what's best for you. But they don't care about what I want. [sighs] Angie, what is it that you want? I wanna model. [deep breaths] Angie, do you know how many opportunities there are in this world for a beautiful woman like you who actually has a brain? But modeling is what I want. - Look. - What is this? It's an audition for models tomorrow. If I win, I can get a $50,000 contract with Pacsun. - And what is Pacsun? - It's a popular clothing brand. Look, I didn't tell my mom or dad yet, but I was wondering if I could go tomorrow? Angie, are you crazy? Your parents will kill me if I let you go to something like that, and while they're on vacation? You know I have to say no. [sighs] You just don't get it. Oh, come on, Angie. That's not fair. You're gonna thank me later, anyway! [birds chirping] - Morning. - Morning. I'm sorry about last night. I know I was a little extra. [chuckles] I remember what it was like when I was your age, and I too thought I had it all figured out. I was head cheerleader on my high school and I wanted to be a professional dancer. So, what happened? Turns out, just as great as I am at dancing, I'm even better at catching bad guys. Look, the point is, sometimes the things we think we want, they change. You're so young, baby girl, and you have so much time to decide. Yeah, you're right. Thanks, Auntie Kris. No problem. The verdict for the Gregory case came in this morning. I guess we'll see if your auntie is as great as everybody thinks she is. Oh, come on, Auntie Kris, you're the best. It's gonna be a guilty verdict. No one's better than you. We'll see. How about I get you your favorite sushi from your favorite restaurant on my way home, and we actually have that movie night that you owe me from last night. Sounds like a deal. Hmm, come here. I love you. [Angela] I love you, too, Auntie. I love you so much, baby girl. I'll see you later. And don't forget, - we have date night, okay? - All right. - [chuckles] See you later. - Bye. The facts and the evidence, it's all there. For almost a decade, Officer Swanson, seized schedule one and two narcotic substances, seemingly to get them off of the streets. Only to entail sell said the same narcotics back into the communities he patrolled, all for his own personal gain. [camera shutters] [upbeat music] [Kristen] Ladies and gentlemen, we deserve better and we demand better. But the only way we can do that, is by showing those like Officer Swanson, that their crimes will not go unpunished. Plain and simple, we need to make an example. [camera shutters] [cameraman] Now, look at me. [Kristen] And you, you can do that here today, by finding the defendant guilty... and bringing back justice and respect to our system. Thank you, Your Honor. The prosecution rests. Thank you, Counselor. Ladies and gentleman of the jury, the facts and evidence have now been presented. The court room will now take a recess for the jury to deliberate. [siren wailing] [Cooper] There she is. Kristen Jordan. [applause] Congratulations. That was a hell of a win. Thank you, Cooper. And indeed, was a team effort. Oh, I'm still shock that you even took the case. Going up against a cop? You could've tarnished your 97% conviction record. - It 98, sir. - [chuckles] And I knew losing wasn't a possibility. I mean, after all, Jurors 5 and 8, both have relatives that were political activists. - That's why we love you. - [chuckles] All right. Drinks are on me tonight, okay? - I'm gonna hold you to that. - Everybody back to work. That was amazing. Great job. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about the Johnson case. - Of course, yes. - What do you think if we use the forensics that we have on him and bring him back in? I think we can definitely convict him off with just that alone. Hmm. Big win. Congrats. [chuckles] - [sighs] - [phone ringing] [Angela] Hey, Auntie. Another win. You were right. I told you. What are you up to? Please don't be mad, but I came to the audition. What? After I specifically told you not to? Are you insane? Where are you? I'm coming to get you right now. - Please don't be so dramatic. - Angela? [Angela] Hey! What the hell are you doing?! What's going on? Angie, what's going on? [Angela] Help, Auntie! - Help! - [Kristen] Angie. - [Angela] No! Help! - Bri! Bri! [Angela screaming] [suspenseful music] [camera shutters] [Kristen] My sister trusted me. She trusted me with her baby, and I let her die. This is... this is all my fault. [sobbing] Kristen, I can't imagine how hard this is for you but this is definitely not your fault. Did you at least find her body yet? You don't have to do this now. Stan, I have to. Okay. We triangulated her calls to a little shady photography studio. Your niece's car was in the parking lot, but that's it. There was no sign of her. Studio? It was clean. It's owned by an Asian man named Hong Wu. He was out of town and we don't have a way to utilize who had the space at that time. What about her phone? Maybe... Her last call was a signal to you. We're doing everything we can, Kristen. Kris, I've known you since you were a rookie. You're like a daughter to me. I've never seen you like this. Go home, take some time. I'm sure the DA's Office will understand. What do I tell my sister? She's gone, Stan. How? [sobbing] Hey, Kris. Where's Angela? What's wrong? Where's Angie? - Kris, what's wrong? - I'm sorry. What are you talking about? Where's Angela? Where's Angie, Kris? Les, I'm so sorry. - What's happened? - She's gone. She's... [Leslie] No, what? Gio! - She's gone forever. - What? - I'm sorry. - No, what? - I'm sorry. - What? - No! No! No! - What's wrong? - Where's Angie? - Mom! - [Leslie] No! - Where's Angie? - She's gone, Gio. I'm sorry. - What do you mean she's gone? - Where's Angie? - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [Leslie] No! [Balor] They found her body dumped in a trash bin, in the woods near Jansen Park. That's awful. You know I could get in trouble for this, right? Stan, it's me. I need this. I need to catch this monster. [Balor] They found a tiny hair but enough for DNA. Well, that's good news. Anything else? There's no blood at the scene. So does that mean she was killed somewhere else, and then dumped into the woods? She wasn't just dumped. She was placed, like posed. Hey, Chief. What the hell is this? - Pump your brakes, Espinoza! - No, Cap. The last thing I need is her snooping around and jeopardizing my investigation. Look, I'm sorry for your loss, but you know the rules, Ms. Jordan, or don't they not apply to people like you? I'm not jeopardizing a damn thing, Espinoza. All I'm... You're a hypocrite, you know that? You stay the hell away from this case, or I'll do everything in my power to make sure you're disbarred. Sorry about that. You know, he was partnered with Swanson years back. You would have put away the person that he was partners with. And this is who you assign to my niece's case? Don't worry. He's a boy scout and one of the best detectives we got. Not only is he gonna do his job, he's gonna do it by the book. Okay. - Hey, Kris. - Hey. I didn't wanna wake her. Is she still asleep? Yeah, she's finally sleeping but she still ain't eating, though. Baby, give me one second, okay? I'll be right back. Kris. By the way, thank you for letting us stay here. It's doing a lot for Leslie. We're gonna get through this together. Leslie. Leslie. No. No. Leslie, no. No. Wake up. Gio! Leslie, no. - Gio! - What happened? - She took some pills. - Baby, wake up. How is she? She's doing as best as she can. She's gonna be okay, though. I gotta get this one home and get some sleep. Okay. I'll be here. - Okay. - Bye, Aunt Kris. Bye, baby. -Get some sleep, okay -Uh-hmm. - Both of you. - Okay. I'm sorry, Kris. I'm so sorry. I screwed up. It just hurts so bad, you know? I miss my baby. I know, sis. You don't have to explain yourself. You just have to promise me you'll never do this again. What about us, huh? What about Diana? She's already lost her sister. She cannot lose her mother, too. I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. [phone ringing] I have to take this. Hello? Are you sure? Okay. Thank you. Sis, they got him. That was the Chief of Police. They made an arrest tonight. - What? - They got him. There was a hit on the DNA linked to the crime scene. - They got him. - So does this mean? This means that they got him and he's gonna pay, Les. He's gonna pay, Leslie. I promise you. He's gonna pay. Stay right here, baby. We'll be right back. I love you. - I love you, baby. - I love you too. [bailiff] All rise. Court is now in session. The honorable Judge Jacqueline Rice presiding. Please be seated. Your Honor, the defense requests that the charges against my client - immediately be dismissed. - Your Honor, this is absurd. Counsel is attempting to turn this into a circus. [lawyer] My office has obtained critical information concerning the evidence in this case. May we approach the bench? You may. What's going on, Kris? I don't know. I think they're trying to say there's something wrong with the DNA. Well, apparently, the DNA obtained in this case has been contaminated. And it is no longer a viable source of evidence. - What?! - What? - Are you serious? - No. - [Leslie] What is going on? - Order in the court! Is there any new evidence the state is prepared to present at this time, to meet its burden of proof? No, Your Honor. Well then, I'm afraid the court has no other option but to grant the defense's motion to throw out this case. Mr. Wilkins, you're free to go. Case dismissed. - What?! - Serious? Kris, is that it? He's free to go? No, hell no. What is this crap?! - Please, please, please. - [Leslie] No, no, no, no. My baby, no, no. No, no. You said we had him, and now he's free to go? - Why? - [Kristen] I'm sorry. - Why? - Thank you. No, no. No! - Hey, Auntie. - I know you did it. - Help me, Auntie. - I know you did it! And I swear you won't get away with it. I swear! I swear you won't get away with this. - Calm down. - Get off of me! - Baby... - No, it's okay. It's okay. - It's okay. It's okay. - He did it. [birds chirping] [elevator dings] - Is this everything? - Yup, just like you asked. [Kristen] Thanks, Bri. Oh, excuse me for a second. Kristen, I heard you were in the building. Why don't you come in to my office so we can talk for a couple minutes? There's nothing to talk about, Coop. I've already told you, I'm not ready to come back, and honestly, I don't know when or even if I ever will be. The Wilkins files? Whether you decide to stay with us or not, I told you to keep away from this. I did. And look how well that turned out. Counselor, just remember there's a thin line between justice and vengeance. [sighs] Ryan. [Dr. Green] You have some friends in pretty high places, Ms. Jordan, to get these files open. Thanks. One more thing. I need an address on Vernon. You know I can't do that. I could lose my license. Mrs. Green, I'm the assistant district attorney. I can assure you no one will ever know I was even here. Detective Espinoza? What are you doing here? I wanna know what happened to the Morales case. - What? - You heard me. I, um... uh, I thought that maybe you could... You thought what? It was an accident. The DNA sampling. Don't give me that crap. I know how serious you take your work. Now what happened? [siren wailing] Got your message. You wanna see me? I wanna know why your name was on the sign-in roster at the forensics lab. - Dude, chill. - Don't tell me to chill. - I wanna know what you did. - Come on, bro. We had to get back at her, for taking down Swanson. So, you let a killer go free, just to settle a score? What kind of cop are you? Whose side are you on? Hey, leave the kid alone, Espinoza. He was only doing what he felt was right. Mind your freaking business, Logan. [chuckles] I'm not gonna say it again, Espinoza. Back off or I'll make you back off. Oh. So all of you are in on this? We let a murderer go free, just to get back at ADA? Hey, I ain't losing any sleep over it. Besides, I mean, how do we know he's guilty anyway, huh? You all deserve to be locked up. [Logan laughs] What are you gonna do, boy scout, hmm? Snitch on all of us? Let's go, guys. Hey. How you holding up? You know me, hanging in there. Not a day goes by that I don't miss her. I'd feel better knowing that Vernon was behind bars. I know, sis. Be patient. I've been following him. He's such a creep. What do you mean following him? Kris, isn't that dangerous? This man is a murderer. What if you get caught? I'm not going to. Trust me. I know what I'm doing. I promise you, I'm not gonna stop until he's behind bars. I promise. [suspenseful music] I heard the owner is about to open this back up. Yeah, back to business as usual. What're you doing here? - I could ask you the same thing. - You know why I'm here. Well then, I guess like you, I'm a little stuck on this one, too. I'm not stuck. I'm right where I need to be. - If you're... - Look, detective... Pablo. The name's Pablo. Pablo. If you're here to tell me that I need to leave, - just no, it's just not... - No. I was gonna say, if you're wondering where it happened, we're thinking about two feet to the left over there. Luminal tests says that there's a high concentration of bleach and cleaning solution, used to scrub the floor, right in that specific area. Did you have anything to do with the evidence? No, I didn't. But there were few other cops that did. - They were trying to... - Retaliation? Yeah. [sighs] So if I had to guess, this was my fault, he got away. - Had I not... - No, Ms. Jordan. Kristen. Kristen. What I was gonna say is, they... We. We failed you and your family. And for that, I'm sorry. I guess I feel a little like it's actually my fault. And I suppose the department isn't gonna do a damn thing about it, huh? There was too many cops involved. Why am I not surprised? Would you like to get some coffee and talk about it more? No, thank you. [sighs] Now look to the left. Now look to the right. And give me more lips. Don't look at me. What was that? Got you. Okay, everyone. That was magnificent. It is a wrap. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Lynette? Uh... may I have a word with you? [Lynette] I'm so glad you invited me here tonight. Thank you for accepting my invitation. Are you kidding? When The Vernon Wilkens asks you out, you don't say no. Hmm. So, how many pics do you have here tonight? Photographs. I have six photographs, four portraits, two still life, and one abstract. How much are they going for? Starting bid starts at 50,000 each. Oh my God. What it's like to be Vernon Wilkens for a day, huh? [laughter] Hmm. But this one... This is one is my favorite. It's beautiful. It was a task to get. Can I ask you a question? Of course. Why me? Out of all the girls you could have brought here tonight, why'd you choose me? It was in your eyes. They spoke to me. Come along. I'd like to show you some pieces during the Renaissance Era. Some might call it contemporary, but honestly, I call it avant-garde. It's a distinct measure between, hmm, art and trash, [laughs] I'd like to say. [Lynette chuckles] [suspenseful music] [camera shutter snapping] [ominous music] Got you. [engine revs] [somber music] - [Kristen] Lynette James? - What the hell? I'm so sorry. I did not mean to frighten you. My name is Kristen Jordan. I'm an attorney for the Los Angeles DA's office. Okay. This is Orange County, what do you want? I... We have reason to believe you might be in danger. What kind of danger? Well, you were with Vernon Wilkens tonight and we actually have been having him under surveillance for quite some time now. Is this about what happened with Angie? Angie Morales, yes. You knew her? I knew Angie from high school. She always talked about modeling. We weren't really friends because she was a grade under me but she was cool. But I don't believe that Vernon had anything to do with her murder. What's it to you, anyway? That was my niece. Oh. Well, um, I'm sorry for your loss. But that doesn't really change the way I feel. Vernon doesn't have to kill or rape anyone. There are hundreds of women dying to be with him. Do you know what one whisper from him can do for a model's career? - Are you one of them? - What? One of the ones that would do anything to get at him? [laughs] Listen, this is a pay to play game, and I'm here to do whatever the hell I gotta do to win. And I know Angie felt the same way. Angie was 17 years old, a baby. And you know what she felt? Pain, despair, betrayal, and a cold steel blade between her ribs. Now, if you don't watch yourself with Vernon Wilkens, I'm sorry to say, you're gonna be feeling that too, unfortunately. Lynette James is her name, and I believe she is his next victim. We have to lock up Vernon Wilkens, now. We have to stop him before he kills her. Wilkens isn't even in town. I don't think he's gonna kill anyone, so I need you to calm down. I know what happened to your niece was tough, but you're obsessing with this guy. I need you to stop it. And how do you know he's not in town? Because I assigned a few of our people on him, that's how. We know that Vernon Wilkens boarded a flight to Paris, first-class, at 6:30 AM this morning. You really think I was just gonna let this guy walk? - I... - We've been watching him for some time now. Wow. Then you know he was just with her last night, at an art show. The bastard had the audacity to have a photo of Angela's hand on display. It's up for auction, Coop. I know, Kristen, and I'm sorry. But we can't just have this guy arrested because he's, uh, a smug, callous jerk. But you can have him detained on suspicion. You know what I found suspicious? It's you, Kristen. What the hell were you thinking, tailing the guy? What if he would have made you? I was thinking that I wanted to see him pay for his crimes! That's enough. You're out of line and you know it. Wow. That's so rich coming from you. Your people are the reason why he got away in the first place. Why haven't any of them been locked up, huh? Tell me that! Kristen, please, would you listen to me? Please. While Wilkens is gone, will you just stop and do some thinking? And think about what you're doing right now? Honestly. You were so focused on this man, I think it's driving you a little crazy. - I don't need time, Coop! - Look, I'm... what I'm saying is, maybe there's another possibility that you're blinding yourself to. No, there's not! He killed Angela. And he's gonna kill Lynette if you two don't do something to stop it! Kristen, you must keep away from Vernon Wilkens. And that's an order you better heed, if you ever think you wanna work with the DA's office again. [Leslie] Okay, Katie. I've got your special, jelly belly cupcake. - Thanks, Les. - You're welcome. [Kristen] Thank you. - [Leslie] Hey. - How's it going? [Leslie] It's good. Kind of slow, but I'm sure things will pick up. It's Thursday. It's always slow on Thursdays. You got my sugar donut? You know I do. [Kristen] Yes! My favorite. I mean, you know, this family business is the only thing that's keeping me going right now. I just wanna say thank you for that. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you, sis. - I love you. - [Leslie] I love you more. You know, I almost love these donuts as much as I love you. - [Leslie] Mm. - Almost. [laughing] [door shuts] Hey, B. What are you doing? I was at the coffee shop, waiting for you. [sighs] I totally forgot, I'm so sorry. Kris, what is this? What are you doing? You know what it is. You took these pictures? You've been following this guy? I'm conducting my own investigation. Since when does taking pictures of this guy mean you're conducting an investigation? Evidence of his movement. I have to be able to catch him in the act. - In the act of what? - [Kristen] I don't know, okay? [scoffs] Look, Kris, this isn't your job. If you want this guy tailed then you get your boss or the cops. I already did that. What if I find something that they didn't? Come on, Kris. You are not Superwoman. Look, this can only end one of two ways, either you are stalking an innocent man, and we both know how that can end if you get caught, or you are tailing a murderer. Both ways are bad. I wouldn't expect you to understand. This is why you've been blowing me off, huh? Huh? Because you've been over here obsessing - over this guy? - Yes! I'm obsessing! He killed my baby niece and she was in my care! This is my fault! Kris... [sobbing] My sister... trusted me with her baby's life and now she's gone. It's my fault. So, I'm gonna do everything in my power to make sure that monster is brought to justice! Does Leslie know what you're doing? Does she know that you're over here doing this? Yes. But she doesn't know everything. She's dealing with enough right now and honestly... I am, too. Look, baby... this isn't your fault. - Nobody's blaming you. - I blame me! I... I blame me. She wouldn't want this for you, Kris. No. But what she wants is her baby back and we can't do that! So, I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make sure he pays for everything he did! Kris, baby, this is consuming you. You gotta talk to someone. Martin, you either get behind me and support me or you can just... Or I can just what, Kris? Or you can just leave me alone and get out of my life because honestly, I can't deal with this right now. Wow. So, it's like that, huh? It's like that. Goodbye, Kris. [siren blares] [police radio chatter] [singer singing in foreign language over radio] [Leslie] I know you're doing this for me, and I thank you for that. I really do, but... We're gonna get him, Leslie. We just need real, concrete, evidence to put Vernon away. I can get that. We did the best we could, and they let that bastard walk, scot-free. I don't trust the justice system. I think it's time we take matters into our own hands. What do you mean? I mean taking the justice system into our own hands. Leslie, you know I can't do that. I will lose my job or even worse, go to jail. He took my baby from me and now he's walking free! I understand that, Leslie, but there's rules. Don't give me that rules crap. Either you're gonna help me or I'm gonna help myself. Come on, Leslie. [phone chimes] I always knew you're the one. [giggles] Ms. Jordan? - Yes. - I'll be your Maitre D' for the evening. Please, right this way. The gentleman will be with you shortly. Would you like a glass of wine, champagne? Moscato will be perfect. - Thank you. - Right away. [ominous music] So basic. I would have taken you for a red wine, woman. You son of a... Come now. No need to make a scene. No need to get the authorities involved. Call them. Go ahead. [Vernon scoffs] And ruin the night. After you so graciously accepted my offer. You? [Vernon chuckles] [Vernon] I wouldn't leave if I were you, especially if one were truly guilty of what you accuse me of. If I were you, I would be worried about my cohort's well-being. Where is Martin? Excellent question. Such a perfect topic of conversation over dinner, wouldn't you say? Let's make a deal. [clears throat] You sit, have dinner with me, and after dinner I will give you Martin's phone, and tell you where he is. - Is everything all right? - Oh! Splendid. I'll have a glass of champagne, the blue caviar, and the filet mignon, extremely rare seafood plate. [Maitre D'] Absolutely, sir, right away. What is this? It's my attempt to let the past be the past. Let bygones be bygones. Let's start a new beginning. Let me get this straight. You kidnap my boyfriend. You steal his phone. You trick me into coming here, coerce me into having dinner with you after you just singlehandedly killed my niece? You are one sick psycho. [Vernon] Oh. No need to be so crass, Kristen. Pygmalion. Pygmalion. Pygmalion. I was merely just trying to have a moment with you. One would call this romantic. If you... think for one second that I feel anything for you other than sheer hatred and contempt, you are sadly mistaken. Hmm, I could understand. You know, after all of the fiasco with the authorities, and then the tragic death of Angela, well, you know, one could see your point of view. What you did. What you did to An... What you did to Angela, you animal. I swear if you speak her name one more time, I don't care if Martin is safe or not, I will personally kill you right where you sit. I see, you're not gonna make this easy. [speaking foreign language] You know, it was tragic, what happened to... Your niece's tragic death, that was awful. But the real question is, would you have traded places with her? What... What kind of sick question is that? Just a conversation. So? In a heartbeat. Interesting. Madam, sir, fresh caviar. - [Vernon] Merci! - [Maitre D'] And your champagne. Ah! You should really try the caviar. It is simply fantastic. Simply to die for in the West Coast. I've lost my appetite. So... did I get the perfume right? Hmm. Vendetta by Valentino, correct? Ah, so apropos for a prosecuting attorney. Such a unique scent. And it has been discontinued for a few years now, so it wasn't easy to get. How do you even know what perfume I wear? That day in the courtroom. Then, again, at the gallery. - What? - My mother used to wear it. You don't really believe that I didn't know that you were following me around, counselor. But I must say, oh, I was so thrilled to have you... so close. Ah, but I was hoping that you would go even further. That you would follow me to Paris so you could see the chandeliers and the Eiffel Tower. So I could show you all of the sites. [Kristen] This is a game to you, isn't this? On the contrary, Kristen, this is kismet. Our worlds were meant to be intertwined, fate... brought you into my life. It wasn't fate. It was your crime. You are a murderer, and you were caught. The only reason why you sit here free is because you got lucky. What you call serendipitous, I call divinity. Call it what you want, but I promise you you will never do it again because I'm personally going to make sure I take you down myself. Why wallow in such sorrow? Ah, you know, my attorneys have informed me that they have arrested a man that they believe is responsible for the crime. See? Justice has been served. So, please, let's start anew. Get this through your thick psychotic skull. I wasn't surveilling you out of some twisted attraction. You are nothing more to me than a depraved lunatic that deserves to spend the rest of his life in a six by eight concrete home on death row. Do you understand me, Vernon? Did you catch my drift? This is the part where we kiss. But since you're gonna be such a Debbie Downer... [clear throat] Let's just call it a night. Where is Martin, Vernon? Here's Martin's phone. He's in the LA Marriott, Room 4266. [speaking foreign language] You should run along. No telling how long he will be conscious. [singing in foreign language] [tense music] Pablo. Kristen, what the hell is going on? I don't know. It's Vernon, I think he did something to Martin. Oh, okay. All right. Did he say a room number? - What's the room number? - 4266. 4266. [Pablo] I need a key to 4266 right away. Mr. Sanders, if you're in there, open up. It's the police. Can I... can I help you? Martin? Oh, you must be the ex-girlfriend. Martin. Martin. Martin, wake up! - Kristen? - [Kristen] Son of a bitch. What are you doing here? - You lost something? - What's going on? [Pablo] Kristen, maybe we should go. Did Vernon put you up to this? Hey, I'm not in this. This is between you guys. Yeah, Kris, it's between us. You kick me out, remember? You... Come on. Come on. Definitely time to go. - Let's go. - [Kristen] Don't call me! - It's over, Martin. - [Pablo] Come on. You wanna tell me what that was all about? Vernon, he text me. He invited me to dinner. You had dinner with Vernon Wilkens? Yes. No! I went there thinking it was Martin. He got ahold of his phone. I'm guessing that slut upstairs must've handed it over in between screw sessions. It's when I got there that he insinuated something happened to Martin. Why go through all the trouble? He knows I'm tailing him. In his sick mind, it's some type of flirtation. He referred to me attacking him in court as kismet fate. You gotta be kidding me. - You sure know how to pick 'em. - Come on, Pablo. It's not funny. I could be next on this man's hit list. Okay. All right. It's okay. You got some place to stay? Your sister's maybe? I would never bring this murderer to her doorstep. It's been enough. You're right. All right. Go home, pack a bag, get some clothes. I got some place you can stay. I usually put my CIs there during a trial to keep tabs on them. - Thank you. - You got protection? I got pepper spray and a Taser in the car. [Pablo] Here. Take this. You know how to use it? Do I? Hey. I'll send somebody to tail you, make sure you get there safe. Thanks so much, Pablo. Yeah, anytime. [tense music] [dramatic music] [knocks on door] [singer singing in foreign language over radio] Detective Espinoza. Uh, please, come in. What brings you here so late at night? I don't know what kind of game you're trying to play. But it ends now. You hear me? I'm... I... I'm so sorry. You... You caught me. I... I'm at a loss. I have no idea what you're talking about. You know exactly what I'm talking about. Kristen! You think it was funny trying to set her up like that? Ms. Jordan... I believe you and she misunderstood my intentions. I was merely trying to inform her of her significant other wayward behavior. Being a good Samaritan and giving her his phone. I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to intimidate her, let her know you can get at her. [suspenseful music] [gasps] Oh, please, please. How does it feel now? No, no, no. Please, please, don't hurt me, please. How does it feel to be threatened right in your face? Please, don't hurt me. [sobbing] Uh, it's seems the LAPD is looking for another discrimination lawsuit. Now, unless you're prepared to see how far this will go, but I would think twice about your next move. Ah, good man. This isn't over, Wilkens. You are amusing. Huh. Such bravado playing the white knight, showing up to be the hero. Does she know? What are you talking about? That you have feelings for her? Ah, another rooster in the hen house. Ah. Like I said, it is of no consequence to me. But you are amusing. Have a good night, detective. [suspenseful music] [laughs] [cell phone rings] [Pablo] Questioned the girl. Name is Beauty. She said some guy paid her to steal Martin's phone and drug him. 10K. You know, whoever it is got a lot of money to be able to drop $10,000 or something like that. [Kristen] You think it was Vernon? Could be. She didn't give us his name. [Kristen] I found something interesting in Vernon's file. Apparently, Vernon has a history of violence dating back to his childhood. He watched his father killed his mother right in front of him, who was an inspiring model. And you know what else is interesting? It was a single stab wound on the left side between the ribs. I'll do you one better. I called in a favor at the FBI and they did some digging on your boy. It turns out that every single address that Vernon's had in and out of the country over the past 20 years, has had a woman's mutilated corpse found within a 30-mile radius. - Are you serious? - As a heart attack. [Kristen] Why haven't they done anything before now? We need to get him. [Pablo] He wasn't on their radar. They haven't been able to connect the dots. Think about it. That's ten countries, three continents. All the victims have been homeless, transient, known prostitutes. That's over 20 victims. And every time they would get closer, he'd just pick up and leave before they can even blink their eyes. So, why did he stay after Angela? That's a good question. [birds chirping] Sorry, we're closed. [suspenseful music] I'm sure you have time - for one more customer. - [gasps] - He came to the bakery? - What the hell, Kris? What am I supposed to... I wanna kill him. What do you mean, he come to the shop? Calm down. Let me figure this out. Just calm down. I know. Let me talk to her. Sis. I came as fast as I could. - What happened? - He came to the shop. He threatened to kill me. He threatened the family. [sobs] I'm so sorry. I swear, we're gonna get this bastard. Really? Who? The police department? Excuse me if I've lost all faith. Because of them, he's out free. Free to do whatever the hell he wants, including what he did today. Look, I'll talk to Pablo and see what we can do about this. I'm tired of you playing by the book. I get you not trying to lose your job, but if you don't do something about this, you're gonna end up losing your family. He's insane! [sobs] [somber music] [birds chirping] Okay. You know I've been watching him. So, I know everything there is to know about him. Where he lives, where he hangs out. And like you said, the law isn't doing enough for us. So, I'm gonna take matters into my own hands. Are you sure you wanna go through with this? I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make sure I bring down this monster. Whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. [tense music] [gunfire] [dramatic music] [gunfire] [dramatic music] [Maitre D'] Mr. Wilkens, right this way. [Vernon] You are beautiful. Thank you. Mind if I take a seat? Ms. Jordan, such a pleasant surprise. You know I'm not gonna take too much of your time. I just wanted to personally let you know I'm coming for you, Vernon. And what I'm gonna do to you, hmm, is far more worse than what you actually deserve. Is that a threat? Oh, yeah. Not if I get to you first. Enjoy. Oh, I will. [ominous music] - Let's see who's stalking. - Oh, so sorry, Vernon. [tense music] [grimaces] [tense music] [Kristen grunting] This is for Angela. [birds chirping] Come on, Mommy. I don't wanna be late! [laughs] Ooh, look at you. Daddy did good with your outfit, - baby girl. - [laughs] You're ready for picture day, huh? - Yeah. - All right. Come on. Let mommy grab her keys. [cell phone rings] Hey, Pablo. What's going on? [Pablo] I'm here. Really? I'll be right down. And what brings you here? Well, I figured today was a special day. It's your first day back at work. I wanted to do the honors of taking you. Aren't you a gentleman? [both chuckles] So, does that mean you get coffee too? - We can arrange that. - [laughs] [car engine starts] [indistinct chatter] [camera shutter clicks] [woman] Here. [camera shutter clicks] [suspenseful music] What a beautiful dress. Oh, thank you. What's your name? Diana. Wow. Such a beautiful name. Big smile, Diana. Big smile. [suspenseful music] [camera shutter clicking] [ominous music] Kristen, it's great to have you back. It feels good to be back, Coop. Thank you. [suspenseful music] [bell ringing] - Diana! - Diana! Have a good day, guys. Diana! - Hey, Leslie. - Hey, Roger. Have you seen Diana? She's not here. She left with her uncle. Uncle? What? What have you done? - [Roger] Uh, I... - No! No. Call the police! - Is everything okay? - No! Call the police! Oh, my God! [suspenseful music] [sobbing] What is going on? He got my baby, Kris. He got my baby. [sobbing] [police siren wailing] Do we know for sure that it was Vernon Wilkens? We've obtained school security footage of the man thought to be the assailant posing as a school photographer. We don't know how he got her, but the footage is of him putting her in the trunk of his car. - My baby. My baby. - What? What's going on? Please, Lord, don't let him take both of my babies. [sobbing] Les, are you okay? - Relax. - Babe. Babe, breathe, baby. - Relax. - Baby, breathe [indistinct] - Ma'am, let us help her. - Breathe. - [sobbing] - She's okay. She's just stressed. Let's give her some space. Can somebody give me a cold towel? - [phone beeps] - I'll be right back. [sobbing] [phone beeps] [suspenseful music] [Leslie sobbing] [suspenseful music] Hey, where's that cold towel? Kristen! Kris! Kristen! - Kristen! - [Giovanni] Kris! [suspenseful music] She's not in there. I need ice on Ms. Jordan now! Kristen! [tense music] [door rattling] [tense music] [classical music playing in the background] Come on, Vernon! I'm here! Where is Diana? [Diana] Aunt Kris! I'm here, baby! [Diana] Aunt Kris! Aunt Kris! [sobs] [suspenseful music] [Vernon] Aww, touching. Come on, Vernon! [classical music continues] I'm the one you want, right? Isn't that why you took her... to get to me? Well, I'm here now! Just me, no cops! [Vernon] Yes, that is correct. You are the one I want. Actually, you're the only one I need. Why? What makes me so special? [Vernon] Don't you know that you are my reason? Everything that I've done has led me to you. Is that why you killed Angela and Lynette? [Vernon] Ah. You're so sweet, Kristen. You remind me of her. Her who? [classical music continues] [Vernon] The only woman I ever loved. My mother. You should've killed me when you had the chance. But you didn't. You didn't because you need me just as much as I need you. Come on now, Vernon. Enough! You wanna kill me? Kill me! Just, please, let Diana go! [classical music continues] [Vernon] It's in the eyes, you know. That's how I choose them. That's how I knew you were the one the moment I saw you. I didn't have to find you. No, you found me. Ah, so tragic what happened to Angela, but, well... never could I imagine that she would lead me to you. Come on, Vernon. I know all about you, Vernon. How your mother was killed in front of you. So tragic... for anyone, but yet... not you, Vernon. You're a survivor. You're not a monster like the man who killed your mother right in front of you. Even took photos... with the only thing your father left you with. His camera. Is that what this is all about, Vernon? Your mother? You don't know anything about me! Why don't you just leave it alone? But no, you had to keep digging and you had to keep digging. You're obsessed with me. You looked for me and you even took the time to get to know me. That's how I knew that we belong together. That's why I spared your life. I'm sorry, Vernon. No child should have to endure that type of pain. But it still doesn't give you the right to inflict that pain onto others! You think this is the Oedipus complex. Don't you psychoanalyze me! You know what? You're right. You took my baby niece away from me! You are pitiful! You're nothing special! You're nothing but a small man that has mother issues! [clattering] [classical music continues] Oh, Diana! I'm so sorry, baby. Are you... are you okay? Oh, baby. I'm so sorry. We gotta get out of here. Watch out! - [screams] - Auntie! [grunts] You don't know me! You are nothing! My mother was a queen! And she was taken from me! [Kristen] Vernon, no. No, Vernon. I'm sorry. You were right, Vernon. Please. [sobs] You were right. I did. I took the time to get to know you. I did. I'm sorry. You were right. We belong together. Now, let me heal you, Vernon. Please. Please. You can't help me. [suspenseful music] [screams] [panting] [Taser clicking] [grunting] [Diana screams] [groaning] [grunting] [groaning] [grunting] [gunshot] Auntie! [Vernon screaming] Move, baby. [Vernon grunting] [gunshots] [sobbing] We got him, baby. We got him. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Go! Go! [dramatic music] [tires squealing] [sirens wailing] [Leslie] Oh, my God. Oh. Oh, my God! Look who's here. - Baby! - Mommy! Oh, my God, baby! Oh, baby. [sobbing] I'm so happy you're okay, baby. Auntie Kris got the bad guy, Mommy. He can't hurt us anymore. I know, baby. You are so brave. Mommy is so proud of you. Y'all need to open up and let me in. This is some emotional mess. [Leslie chuckles] [indistinct] [sighs] I'm happy we got him. Me, too. So, I was wondering. If I was to ask you out, what would you say? I'd say, what took you so long? [chuckles] I know a good restaurant. It's a date. [melancholy music] I love you, sis.
