What are you planning? Why did they depart destroyer? There was a mistake I have to give orders to Moscow Immediately secure communication lines Sir, we might be under threat attack in the near future I closed the base, and turn off all communication as a security precaution That's not your decision I have to tell the minister, parliament and my general I talked to them, and I told them that you are not healthy and in my care This isn't done yet Stop Dmitri? /From now on, all military orders will come from me / Dmitri, they won't follow your orders They have no choice As far as they know, all orders are I'll give it to you I am your Defense Minister And I intend to defend our interests and our country from every threat, from inside and outside, and from those who are weak-hearted Well Don't move, President You will be punished At all times know what happened, the nation will be at war, and only worry about their lives All other things will be forgotten Come on, sir Hey, do you see this? Take the sound Do we have a voice? Can you increase it? Gosh Shit This is the overthrow of the government I have to tell the President He will recommend dispatch the entire fleet He just does his job / You know what that means I need you to help me What about other ministers? Whatever happens there, Durov will definitely be aggressive He will cheat his people and all over the world Can we prove this is the overthrow of government? The facts are simple Durov departed the fleet to fight If we give them profits by attacking now, nobody will remember who attacked first I recommend preparing the entire defense fleet Sorry, Admiral We do what they want Drain he wants our fleet to attack Do you want to say, him want an all-out war? I said, I think all this is planned The Russian Constitution states if the President is not healthy during the time of active hostility, all authorities fall in the hands of the Russian Minister Whoever started the rumor only to gain power I mean This is not about Russia, we deal with one Minister who defected So this is the overthrow of the government and military control If we pursue Durov, What will happen? He might kill Zakarin Which I think is the reason he keeps Zakarin alive This is not the time to analyze himself or his history We can't fight it, unless we respond now An attack that can kill 100 million Americans They don't want war all out, just like us When someone takes it step on the chessboard, you respond Maybe we have no choice What if we free President Zakarin? What? We don't have / Let him talk Thank you mom We have a team outside Polyarny base And submarines outside the coast They already have a position and can save the President I know they want to be involved If we can bring Zakarin to Moscow, he can stop this We save the Russian President? We may not like Zakarin, but he is better than Durov Or there will be war Admiral, convey this Send the fleet to position We need to get ready to face them But, I want everything possible to prevent this Your saving effort is also done Everyone, we ordered go to AL Polyarny Base There? / How far is that? Far enough / The place is very depends on the destroyer Half the Russian fleet is there I'm afraid, they say this is priority Admiral Durov planned overthrow of government We are there for pick up our 4 people, and 1 President of Russia Give me a list of intel land mine / Yes, captain Check torpedo and weapon systems Show, pilot The place is filled by sensors and sonar We have to find a way to go there without being detected You're right, XO that's why we need a local navigator Can he speak English? / Yes, he just doesn't want to talk Okay, thanks I'm sorry for your men We have met before I've passed your ship I read your file, Captain Me know you speak English Fuck you / Okay Good once we just talked I have nothing to say We did not shoot your submarine, Captain No one You don't trust me? Look at this You explode from inside out Why are you showing me this? I don't work with enemy I'm not a traitor Not I don't call you a traitor The traitor is the person who blew up your submarine The person responsible for the death of all your young sailors, Admiral Durov Durov arrested the President at Polyarny We were ordered to go there to save him I can't do it it's without your help They are my people I won't kill them We don't try to kill your people We just try save your President And maybe stop this You and I are no different We are already down here in all of our careers From head to toe We are not enemies. We are brothers Who else understands what are we going through? Anxiety, fear, months in the bomb which can explode on the sea floor That is ourselves That's what we do So you know what my sacrifice is for can get you out of the submarine I betrayed my men, I betrayed my ship I will be tried militarily It's just that thing the right thing to do This isn't about your side or my side This is about our future Sir, we found there who transmits Come from this base What's the situation, boss? /Just I got orders from Washington Someone came Come on We already hold you The bullet missed, but he needs to rest Listen There is good news and bad news We don't need to die here USS Arkansas sends ship to pick us up American submarines are here? / Yes This is the problem. We have to take it President of Russia, and bring him with us Shit I can't help This changes things I don't want to exaggerate, but I have a feeling if we can't do this, things will get more get worse / fuck This is already chaotic GuavaBerry How about Martinelli? I have other plans for you Captain, we are waiting for your order OK I'll be right there / Yes, sir How are the crew? /They won't say it, sir But I've been with them for a long time They are scared And how about you? For 22 years doing this, I have never been shot, or such cases I'll meet you there With all due respect, sir, you keep giving orders, let us worry about it Okay, let's go GuavaBerry Captain in the control room USS Arkansas, this is your captain We will go to Polyarny Base There has never been an American ship who made it there Hura, Arkansas!
