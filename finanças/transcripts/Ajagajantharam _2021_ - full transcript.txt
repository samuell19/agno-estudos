After the festival, in the evening, when the fireworks begin, it's the perfect time. Let's leave then. Should I come with my bag during the fireworks? Don't come here with your bag, during the fireworks. Call me after you pack your bag. I will come there. I'm really scared about it. You don't have to be scared. I have planned this, right? I am more worried than you. Okay? - Yes. Lakshmi, tell her. - Yes. Hey! Will the elephant come at least this time? This festival is not conducted by your committee. If we've promised to bring an elephant, we will bring it. Brother, how do I go to the temple? - Go straight and take right. Would Sahadevan come, at least? Well, no elephant has come to our town so far. That's why I asked. - Is it? Not just one or two. This Hari will bring all the five Pandavas here. If that's necessary. Do you want to see that? Hariyetta, the elephant is here. Is it here? - Huh? They didn't call when they reached. But your mobile is not available. My mobile? - Yes, come. Gopalakrishnan! It's here, by the way. Okay. Stop gossiping in the morning and leave. Bloody gossip monger. What did these guys think? That Hari won't be able to bring an elephant? It has come, right? Of course. I saw it. Venuetta... Salutes to the Goddess. - Salutes to the Goddess. He hasn't been drinking for a month now. He has taken a vow against it. If he's abstaining from it, Venuettan is such a nice person. He's too good. Dude, who is this new item? Who? Looks like a solid item! He looks like he's quite sick! Leave it, bro. It's a nice day, right? Are you a doctor to cure his sickness? Kanna, shall we slap him on his face? Let's have a couple of drinks first. We'll do it after that. Are you crazy, Kannan? Picking a fight for no reason. Let him go. It's their mood, right? Their choice. Shouldn't we talk to them? Come, let's settle his mood. Go! Go get it. Move. Namaste, brother. Namaste, brother. You seem to be a player! You're an awesome dancer, huh? Western or Classical? I'll do Western dance, and Eastern too. Let that be. What do you want now? If you ask me what I want, teach some of your moves to us as well. Then we can do a group dance, right? Yes. - Is it? You...!! What? - I'll set you straight. Kannan! Kannan! How is this? You go and practice this move first. And then teach that guy who ran away, as well. I'll teach you the rest of the moves later. I'll punch you in your face! Kannan! Dude, he kicked our Pindi. - Didn't I warn you guys against it? You guys asked for it. Kanna, he kicked me. Come with me. Move away! Is this all what you want to do? The bride and groom would have reached home by now. You look straight and ride, man.

Hello? - Click our photo now. - Mr. Groom! - Where are you? Where I am? I can't hear you. Where are you? I'm at the Aranjali temple. The festival is happening here, right? What? Hey! Aren't you coming here? How can I come? - Leave Jolly there and come here. How can I come leaving this dimwit here? Move forward. - Dimwit? Stand next to the elephant. - Where did I go? Stand close to it. - Are you blind or what? I'd need two people to handle the elephant. He escapes the second I'm not looking. Okay then. - I can't hear anything. I'll call you later. - Okay. Okay. - Bye. Hey! Hold this phone. Hey! Click an awesome group photo of all of us. Don't stick to her. Come here. Stand here. Smile, everyone. Hail Lord Shiva! The morning festivities will begin on time, right after the feast. As part of Aranjali temple festival, there will be a special programme at 6.30 PM today. What are you doing here? Dance! - Get going! Go and bring the barks for the elephant. Look at him dancing! I feel like kicking him! Chetta... Chetta... I'm yet to be paid for four dramas. Pay at least this one, Chetta. - Keep quiet. Right when my a** is on fire. Boss, we have done performed at around 120 stages, right? I haven't even got the money to make my monthly savings! Monthly savings? I haven't been able to pay my EMIs. Hey! What's your plan? I've been waiting since morning, dressed like this. I've got a TV serial shooting at Chitranjali studio tomorrow. Speak to the committee and sort my issue first. Talk to me only after that. Hey! I'll call you back. - Hold this, dear. I'll call you. We'll decide. - My dear Devarajan, you also saw the situation here, right? They are not even letting us say anything to them. And you want a discussion? We've missed 2 meals now. Let us eat something first. Then we'll talk about going out. Move away. What is it? Boss, what about my tail? I'll make a snake bite you! I'm so damn hungry here and... 'The Sun God has risen' 'Why was the Sun God late to rise today?' Stop here. Come! Here. 56 Rupees. What is it? Can I get a cake? - How many kilos? Black forest cake, weighing 2 kilos. We don't have all that. No? Then give me whatever cake you have. Okay. Hey! Switch it off! Whose name should I write on this? Happy Birthday, Kachambar Dasan! Happy Birthday Kachambar Dasan... What's the spelling of 'Kachambar Dasan'? You should ask me if you don't know, right? Give me the phone. Dasettan? What's the spelling of 'Kachambar'? Do you have to call me to find out the spelling of Kachambar, you ******? I've told you a hundred times not to ask me all that! I'll adjust with something. - Hang up, you bloody... Pack it! Don't bother about the spelling now. Move! That's a nice song! Is there a liquor store here? - There might be one at Andippulikkavu. At Andippulikkavu? - Yes. I don't booze usually. But since this elephant has come from the Andamans, I must booze! Is it? Dasettan's house is nearby. You can get Patta (barks) there. I can get Patta (arrack) there? - Yes, come. Patta (barks) for the elephant. - Sheesh! Who wants that! There's a look-out notice for him in 14 States. Be it with the police, narcotics, or customs departments, he has 237 cases against him, in all possible sections. If someone is an even bigger most wanted fugitive than Sukumara Kurup in Kerala, that's our Dasettan. Kachambar Dasan. Is this Dasettan's house or a bar? It's an underground hideout. You should get me a pint bottle! - Dasettan will arrange all that. Or I'll lose control. We'll get it, man! Boys! Dasan was just another worker in the boat owned by these bosses. Balan's son Dasan became Kachambar Dasan, through my own hard work. Because my spine is strong! That's awesome, Dasetta. Of course. - Have it! Have a couple more drinks. - Drink! Drink! Do you guys know the relationship between this temple and me? Dasan's beginning was from the festival ground of this temple. From then till now, there have been many problems. There are many cases in my name too. But the police won't catch Dasan. They are not going to catch me, either. That is Dasan's play! So, is Dasan a wanted criminal? - Of course. Who are you? Jolly. You don't seem so jolly. Come here. Dasetta... Jolly is my name. He's a mahout, Dasetta. - Move, son. He has come for barks. - Dasetta, chicken. Take it inside. - You don't want it? Which elephant is it? Neysheri Parthan. No elephant which has come to this town, should stay hungry on Dasan's birthday. You cut as many barks as you want, from my backyard. Do you want a drink? I will drink it! It was a Church festival last night. I got really sloshed. Ullas! - Yes, Chetta. - Get this boy a drink. Happy Birthday, Dasetta. - Thank you. Thank you, kid. Have it. - Drink it. Who is this? That's Garudan. He has taken a vow of abstinence to perform in the evening. Garudan won't wait till the evening. I will perform here. I will dance now! 'Sway, dear snake... Dance, dear Garudan' Hey! Play Dasan's song! Where is the bridegroom's cousin? The groom is at Viraj town Where is the bridegroom's cousin?

Oh God! Don't increase the smoke. Use the firewood. Pour it fast. Give me the tender coconut. Wow! Awesome! Go give it there. You're still chopping this? We're about to serve food for the feast. It's done, President. Last year's Sambar was low on Asafoetida. Increase it this time. The Chenda (drums) players are waiting there. Go eat them up! Damn it. Surendran... It was truly out of the world. Happy to hear that. - You made it grand! The crowd was ecstatic. I was in so much pressure and tension. Now I can walk with my head held high. Have a glass of tea. He's talking as if he conducted the Thrissur Pooram. It's all a mess. The drama won't happen. What happened? - The TV serial actor who came to act in the drama, eloped. They are.. Where is he? Come. - They're saying that they won't perform without him. An actor eloped? I don't know, President. He was troublesome since yesterday. But I didn't think he would elope. My God! - Why do you have to worry about that? Only one guy has gone, right? Rest are here, right? You guys perform. - We can't do that. It's the Sugreevan of 'Sugreevan Army' who has left. We can't perform any scene without him. Hey President! I don't want tea. Bring me a tender coconut. Did I ask you to bring tea now, Pappi? Take it back! Give it back! President, listen to me. I've done so many programmes with Mr. Jibuji. Yes, so many. If it's okay for all of you, this Surendran can act as Sugreevan. No! No! He can't do it. Surendran can't do it. - Why? A drama has a set of rules. What set of rules? 'Self controlled and vehement... One who shows great excellence' He can't do that. Let's look for someone else. I can act really well. Will you? - Yes, I can act well. Really? - Hey! We have to perform a play at Payyannur tonight. We need to reach there by 8 PM. They will burn us alive. So you brought up this set of rules here, to go to Payyannur? I'll bite you up! What did you say? Self controlled? Self controlled and vehement.. - He will do it without that. Aren't you ready? - Yes! Yes! There are many dialogues in this. Surendran won't be able to do it. - Dialogues? Vanquishing thousands, removing my royal robes in my bedroom, I would have taken an auto rickshaw to come and see you, mother. Why? Kollam Arena. I am just an ordinary man who saw his dreams, under the tower that touches the skies and the stars, with just the light from a mud lamp. Just an ordinary man! 'Kottarakkara Sreebhadra' Even if a thousand skies rise against me, you can't defeat this Sugreevan, boys! No one can defeat this Sugreevan in this Kishkinta forest, boys! This is enough. - I do act well, right? Surendran will be perfect for Sugreevan. Surendran, this is not like banging with your sticks on your Chenda. Here, you have to go up on the stage, and give goosebumps to the audience. That's what? - I've got goosebumps. Did you get it, President? A long time back! - See! I have many more tricks up my.... Don't show that! I was saying that I will act really well. My dear brothers, this is not possible. Let us go. - That's enough. You got an actor, right? Now take him! - Presi! You got Surendran instead of Sugreevan, right? Now go up on stage. Take him! - Come on! I'll tell you about my Kathakali performance. Let it inspire you. Long back... Shut up! - Oh my God! That hit him right on the bum! Hello! Even after being in deep meditation for decades, without eating or sleeping, Even after praying aloud, so loud that they would pierce through all the horizons, No one heard this Sugreevan's pleas. Chetta.. Jibuji... Am I supposed to say this dialogue? Aren't you playing Sugreevan, Surendran? - Yes. I can't say such a long dialogue. Didn't you say over there that you have many tricks up your sleeve? Bring them out! I have them! But not this! I know only that dialogue which I said earlier. Don't be shocked. You've come to act as Sugreevan, knowing only that dialogue? It just happened. - Will you get me killed? What is this? Hey! Hey! Hey! - Sorry. It's the mace. Don't stand here like you've swallowed a banana. We have to perform the drama at 8 PM tonight. Don't get me beaten up by the committee members. Take positions! Where? - Boss, my tail! Get lost with your tail, you monkey! Take positions! Shall we start then? Cheers! Have a drink, man! - I don't drink. You don't drink? There are many people here, who come here just to drink. Go upstairs. Keep it there. Very nice item. - Get lost. Hey! What about your marriage? Even my boy who's worse than you, has found a girl. Can't you get married and start a family? Why are you guys laughing? Why are you laughing? - Can't I laugh? I will give them poison. I swear. - You give them whatever you want. Definitely. Shall I get you some poison? You're drinking quite a lot, right? That's enough. Hey! Marriage will happen when it's the right time. It's better that we chill like this, having a couple of drinks, in a jolly good mood. Jolly good mood is fine. But see to it that it doesn't mess up your body. Hey! Say this to your son as well. Keep it there. - Hey Kichu! Let's have a drink. - Keep it inside. - Where are you going? Calm down. - My friend is waiting outside. Don't rush. - We'll come now. Don't go overboard. We'll have a quick drink and come. - Come fast, okay? Will you get me divorced today itself? Have a drink, dude. - Not now, dude. I'll have it after lunch. - It's your wedding day, right? I need to talk to people, right? - You'll be in a jolly good mood. You need to stay strong at night, right? Then fix a large drink. That's called heroism. - Okay, go ahead. There are no munchies! Don't spoil it by adding water. I'll sort it out now. - Mr. Bridegroom! You are awesome! Shall I fix another one? Come, let's go. Devotees waiting for the feast conducted as part of the Aranjali temple festival, should pay the fees at the temple committee office and get the receipts. The temple committee humbly requests all devotees to participate in the feast happening at the temple now, without crowding up. The feast is about to begin. All devotees are requested to reach the dining area. Dude, Pindi. Barge in for the first serving itself. That's right! Or they'll add water in Sambar. - Move! - Move! Move, Chetta. Don't push. Let us get in, man! Move away! Stop there. - Move away. Come here. There are empty seats here. Come and sit here. This is a big one. Come here. Hey! Get me those chips! I'd die for chips! It's my chips! These guys don't have any decency. - Hey! I don't know why. I have a chest pain. Must be gas, right? **** on a drumstick! Didn't I warn you a hundred times, not to mess with him during the festival? Are you happy now that your chest is smashed? What? - His chest is paining, it seems. My hands are itching to smash his face! Yeah, right? - Then why didn't we see this fervour over there? You were happily receiving every blow you got, right? Hey! Serve the rice! The drama seems to be in a mess now. - Will the drama happen today? Get lost. It will happen! Yeah, right? - Are you still thinking about it? That's only in the night, right? Let's have a couple of drinks, have the Sadya(feast), and get rid of that headache. This is such a lousy committee! Look who all are sitting there! - Can I get some Aviyal? Sheesh! Shameless fellows! They've barged in for the first serving itself. Come, let's go talk to them. Hey! Bring the Sambar. Bring it here. - Two people needn't be there. Get up, you...!! What? - You've come shamelessly for free meals? You have your food, man! This is not their family property, right? They're also making money from this. We can also have some food then. Bloody wretch! Have you ever made anyone speak anything good about you? Leave him. - You leave him. - Kannan, no. You get lost. You're hogging in the first serving itself? I'm so hungry, dude. I haven't had breakfast. Okay, carry on! Hey bro! Happy married life! - Thank you, bro. Such a sweet smile. - Aren't you eating? I will eat later. Shall I pour some Parippu curry? - Go ahead. Over your hand like this... Do you want some? Some Parippu curry? - Very little. That's enough. - A little more? - No. Kichu... Keep the Pappadam here, mix it with the Parippu curry... It's your wedding anyway, right? Let me feed you a little. Like that! Here's some for you. It's okay. Have it. Come on! Eat it. - Hey! It's his wedding today. Can't you leave him alone at least today? Getting drunk and misbehaving... Keep quiet, mom. - You shut up! Hey! What the hell have you done? What's wrong with you? You're throwing rice on to his face on such a sacred day? Who invited him for the wedding? Who are you to show off at my son's wedding? [inaudible arguments] Uncle!! You...!!! Move away! Move! - Break everything! Get lost! Lali, don't fight. Move away. Oh my God! Oh God, save me! Come on! Don't hit me, Chetta. Pindi, you son of a *****! Oh my God! - Leave him, Uncle. Move away. Where's my rice? Beat up everyone! That's gone, damn it! Move away. - You get lost. You've ruined my wedding. Come here, you... Break everything! Don't spare anyone. Come on! Move! Move away! Put me down. Oh God! These guys have created such a mess. Come fast. They are all watching the fight? Pull them away! Move away! What are you doing? You want to disgrace your father? You bloody... Get up! What are you doing, President? Take him away! Go to hell! - Aren't the father and son ashamed to do this? Kanna, take him away. - Come home in the evening. I'll give you the rest there. Take them away. Hari, tell me if I am right or wrong. This bunch is useless to their families and the people here. You're still thinking about it? Forget it. I can't forget it so easily. Has he made anyone say anything good about him so far? That wretch! President, what about the commission for the sound & light equipments? I told you that we'll talk about it in the night, right? Do one thing now. Ask these boys to clean this mess. Boys, arrange everything properly. There's no point blaming him, Chetta. His friends are the problem. - Why? That rascal called Kannan? He does all sorts of atrocities. Your son will be saved, if he escapes from that guy's clutches. This Kannan is your son, right? Yes, correct. That scoundrel indeed. - What is this? My bad luck! - Leave that. We've got curry all over us. Let's have a couple of drinks and go home for lunch. Let's do that then. Come. A piece of lady's finger, got in there then. My family has been warning me several times to stop hanging out with you. That's nice. Why are you laughing? - Because it's funny. - That was a wedding venue. And not your festival ground. - Is it? Dude, if someone messes with me, I'll wreck them up. Whoever it is. Do you have any doubt? I know that you'll never learn! You're such a nuisance. - Don't be upset. - Come! Darling! Hey! Don't be upset, darling. I love you. - Go to hell. A long time dream of Aranjali devotees is coming true today. The deity of Aranjali Mahadevan will be carried on the elephant, Neysheri Parthan. Darling, come forward. Find out where they are. I can't find them. - They must be behind the temple. Where? - Over there. I can't see them. Will they be on the other side? Move. - It's really colourful out here. You want to start again? - Shall we ask them? Chetta.. - What is it? Where's the mahout? - On the other side of the temple. At the backside? - Near Thekkinkadu. Thanks, Chetta. - Okay. Hey kiddo! Pass me that bottle. Here you go! Thank you! - Okay! Come! You can buy the bangles later. Come with me. - What? Vinu.. - Where are you taking me? - Come. In this form? - You can change on the way. Tell me where we are going. - I will tell you. I don't want to be part of any more fights. Let me go. What game are you playing, Chetta? Get up and leave if you don't want to play! Come, let's go. Lousy game. Should we go now? - Keep your hand there, elephant. What is this elephant doing? Hey elephant! Do you want to get beaten by me? Where's you assistant mahout? - I don't know. Did you guys see him? No. He does this all the time. Leaving me and going away. When does the programme start in the evening? - Around 6 PM. Isn't there anything to drink? - We're going to get that. Bring it on! Make it fast. - Okay. - Come on, elephant. Bro, you've got a good hand, huh? Get lost. - I will leave after meeting Ambi. Wait, we'll go after the festival in the evening. I'll come back in the evening. - Get lost, kid! Ambi! Dude! - He wants the elephant's tail now! You're here? I just got here. Don't scare the kids, dude. I can scare only the kids, right? How is he? - No particular change. Just like he was earlier. What happened to him, Lali? Did he fall from the scooter? We had attended Kichu's wedding. Not attended, you ruined the wedding. - You went with him, right? It would be a surprise if he doesn't do that. How's the girl? - She's good. Nice chick. - Get up, elephant. Get up, elephant. Jolly! When did you guys come? We just got here. - You came here in the morning and left without meeting us? You're really irresponsible. We had gone for the wedding, bro. Who is this guy? - Egan. Why? Have you boozed? No. - Come here. I haven't boozed. - Come here. You haven't boozed? - No. No, boss! - Will you lie to me? - Jolly! I've told this to you a hundred times. I'll rip you apart. I haven't boozed. I will admit it if I've done it. He's sloshed in the morning itself. I haven't boozed. I'm staying here only for my mother's sake. - Mother? I am going to Dubai. To Dubai. - To Dubai? Scrub really well and wash him! Then you scrub him. Come on! The elephant won't be hurt. Who's that? Garudan is drunk, huh? This is Garudan! This guy is so annoying. - Shut up, Garudan. Bloody dogs! Shut up! - You! Get lost! - I'll slap you! Dasetta.. Garudan is totally sloshed. He can't even stand up, leave alone dancing. Is it? Call Break Balan here. Balan! Hey! - Yes. I heard that you're a great dancer. - Yes, Chetta. You're really famous in Chalakkudy, is it? Not just Chalakkudy. He's famous in Chavakkadu too. I am famous in Chavakkadu and Chalakkudy. Then take the crown from that Garudan's head and wear it, and perform the Garudan dance at the temple. I don't know the Garudan dance, Dasetta. It's really simple. Come on. At Dasan's festival, Garudan dance and break dance are all the same. Give it to me. My crown. - Here! My crown. - Tie it up! Look at me. - Shut up, Garudan! Come on, dance! Practice your moves. Start! Like that! Dasetta, this Garudan will fly, right? Or will he leave it midway, like Unnimary? If Unnimary leaves it midway, TG Ravi will be reincarnated here. Come on! Pindi, forget it. Don't tell Kannan that he came back. Why do we need unnecessary troubles? You will be fine. I was the one who was humiliated. Give it. I will hit him anyway. I will hit him hard. It's a good day, right? This festival? Forget it. Let him go. Festival, it seems. You're just itching to be disgraced in front of the people. Hey Cracker! You're taking all this home? - No. To your wife's house. - Now you felt good, right? That wasn't necessary, right? - Yes. Give it to me before you finish it. Kannan, the festival is not that great this time, right? It has just started, right? It will become grand by the evening. Dude, where's your partner who got kicked? He'll be coming here soon. Will he fool us by not turning up? - No way! Rajan, fix two drinks. Govindan, fix them the drinks. - Let me have them quickly. Dhara, heard that the feast was grand! Get lost! - Chetta, fix a large drink! Hello? Hello? I'm going to the temple. - I'll throw that phone away. Everything is ready. I'll call you when it's time to leave. Okay? Bye. Hello? What are you doing here? Aren't you going to the temple? - Yes. Then get ready quickly. - Anu Chechi hasn't come. I'll go after she comes. - Didn't you keep these back? So irresponsible! Wait. That rascal has come. - Who? That loser who created a scene in the morning. Who? The guy who kicked you? Yes. - He's the mahout's friend. He has gone there. Give me a cigarette. - Kannan! We should beat him to pulp! Dhara, don't you remember the scene in the morning? You get lost. - Hey! I haven't even eaten properly. I was asked to leave, when I'd just started eating. We were humiliated in the morning and at noon too. If we're humiliated again, we'll have to leave this town. Fix me a drink! We'll put them to sleep! Let it get dark. We'll feed them milk and put them to sleep. Let's go. Pindi... God has no equals I have to see the God in the temple I have to see the Theyyam dance As I dance hard in the rhythm of the drumbeats Everyone will stand up and pray together Tying the palm leaves, applying quicksilver on the face Lighting a lamp in a plantain leaf I prayed looking at all four directions I prayed to all thirty three crore Gods Don't you have a God? Don't I have a God? Don't you have a God? Don't I have a God? I planted a small plant once A flower has blossomed from that plant Flowers blossomed, the tree bore fruits It became a huge grove Many birds perched on that tree Those birds built a nest on the tree With this tree, that tree and all sorts of trees, it became a huge grove. The whole world became a grove It became a huge grove. The whole world became a grove It became a huge grove. The whole world became a grove It became a huge grove. The whole world became a grove Jolly! You're sloshed like shit, huh? Ambi, the festival is awesome! This is awesome too. - Is it? Boss! - What is it, kiddo? Boss, shall I feed these bananas to the elephant? Go ahead. Feed it, kiddo. You have the boss' permission. Will the elephant get mad? - He's my elephant. Hey elephant, take it! Here, eat it. - Hey! What is this? I've come to feed bananas to the elephant. What? - I've come to feed bananas to the elephant! - You've come to feed the elephant? Who asked you to feed it? - The mahout! Ask him! - Who? Ask him! - This schmuck? - Yes! Did you ask him to feed the elephant? You're getting thulped by this elephant regularly. Now you want it to attack others too? Get lost. - I will go! He wants to feed bananas, it seems! What is it? Get going! - What? You shut up. - Get lost. Run away! What is it? - Staring at me? These kids have come to feed bananas to the elephant. - Get lost. Get going! - What? Itching for a fight? Get going! You get lost! Move! Make way! Dasetta! Dasetta! When I went to feed bananas to the elephant, the mahout hit me. - What? They hit me when I went to feed bananas to the elephant. Get lost! Silly kids! The mahout hit me! Who was it? The mahout! Move away! Move away! Move away! Feed the bananas. No one is going to stop you. Go ahead. Feed it. Let me see it. It will be a problem, dude. Who wants to feed the elephant? - This is the guy who hit me. If you come near the elephant, I'll thrash you. You feed it. - I want to see how you're going to feed it. Move! Move away, you losers! We'll decide what our elephant will eat! Don't mess with us! Come on! - Get lost! You want to see us feeding it? - What? Who are you? Don't interfere in unnecessary problems. I'm the mahout. What's your problem? Why is the mahout wearing shorts? Is a fashion parade happening here? It's my choice whether I want to wear shorts or a mundu! Who are you to question me? - You'll know who I am! Hey! You needn't stay near the elephant wearing shorts. I've been seeing you creating a ruckus here after getting drunk. Get going! Who are you to ask that, old man? You get lost. Don't touch me! You'll know my true colours. You get lost. Here! Is your itch over now? Are you happy now, old man? No! We will go only after feeding it. Look now! I'm wearing a Mundu now. Did that cure your itch? - No! Will you cure it? I will cure it. I'll cure your damn itch! I'll cure your itch, you bloody... Thrash them! Pindi, no! - Lali! Beat them to pulp! Kanna, no! Stop it. Don't do this. - Move away! Kick them! - Kill them! Come on! Kanna, kick him! Kick them! Thrash them! Punch him in his gut! Topple him! Don't let him go! Hit him! Move! Move away! Get the bullhook and tear them apart! Give it to me. Pin him down! - Move away! Finish him! Come forward if you dare. I'll stab you all, you scoundrels! Come if you dare. - He is crazy! Don't go close to him. If you come close to me... Come on! Lali! Vinu! - Hey Vinu! - Dude, get up! Vinu! - Vinu! Vinu, get up! Interval Move away. Hey Vinu! Vinu? Move away. - Get up, dude. Lift him up! Take him to the hospital. Hey! Get up! Beat those pigs to death. Come and hit me if you dare, you scoundrel. Shut up! - What? - Come on! Let's talk it out. Don't aggravate the issue! Harietta, this is an elephant, not a goat. If it causes any trouble, you'll be answerable for that. Move away, Dad. I want to split his head open. Chetta, it was an accident. Forgive me. Come here. I'll forgive you! I had warned him to shut up. I'm getting really pissed off. - Hey! Take them away. Harietta, take them away. Let me see how you're going to get out of here. We'll see. Shut up, man! I'll kill you, you pig! Come on. - Leave me. You'll do squat! Let go of my hand. Let the festival happen properly. We'll hit them after that. Listen to me. Who will be answerable for breaking his head? Kannan, take Dhara with you and go home. Go, Dhara. - No. We'll go only after beating them to death. Understood. Let this drama get done. President! Come with me. Come, I say. Let me tell you something. Hey Pindi. Call all our boys. Send them away. Take the injured guy to the hospital. So shouldn't I come? Dayanandan! - Okay. I'll go. Chetta, if there's a problem here, it won't be just me, you will also end up being disgraced. Tell me the matter. - Great! We've collected Rs. 1.5 Lakhs to bring the elephant. And we've given those guys only 50,000 Rupees. If the people come to know about this, our reputation will be tarnished, in this town, and at home too. Remember that. - Is that so? You do one thing. We will settle this issue. Come. - Good for us then. All of you leave. That's enough! Go! Take him to the hospital. Priest! The festival has come to a halt, right? Get down now. Untie its caparison also when you come down. How do I get down from here? Ask him to make it sit. - We should have given them a couple more poundings. I've told you a hundred times, Lali. Can't you calm down? Hey! Can you ask the elephant to sit? Sit down, elephant. Sit down! Now get down. Dasettan.. - Move away! Dasetta! Dasetta! It's a big problem there. A huge fight at the festival ground. One guy hit Vinu on his head and injured him! Who did it? - It was the mahout, Dasetta. Scoring a goal against Dasan's boys at Dasan's home ground? Come on! - Come! We will settle this. Listen to me first. [inaudible arguments] Dasan! Dasan! Who hit him? It was him, Dasetta. Who is he? He came with the elephant, Dasetta. Dasan, no. Don't start a fight again, Dasan. Move away, dad! Move, I say! Move away! Who are you to come to my town and disrupt my festival? I'm also from around here, Chetta. I haven't come to disrupt the festival. But those who actually want to disrupt the festival are here amongst us. If someone messes with me, I won't take it silently. That's why God has given us two legs and two hands, right? What will you do with your hands & legs? Dasan! Dasan! Don't do anything. Dasan, no! - What's your problem? It's their problem. They will solve it. Who are you to interfere in it? I'll put an end to your arrogance! Move away! Beat them to death! Set the elephant free! Hey! Stop him! Come on, elephant! Move forward! Hold Dasettan! Protect him! Attack them! Dasetta! Come on! Come, if you dare! You guys are stiill alive because you have the elephant with you! Go forward and hit them! The elephant has gone berserk. - President, run away. Call the police, Hari. Trample them! Attack them! Come on! Move forward! Move forward, elephant. Hit them, Parthan! Parthan, trample them! Come on! Come on! - Dhara, Girish, move away. Parthan, move to the left and topple them! Come on, topple them! Parthan, come on. - Come forward if you dare! Move! Parthan, smash them! Trample all of them! Dasetta, get up. - Come here. Let's settle our scores. Come on! Come on, move forward! Parthan, trample them! Come forward if you dare! Come on! Raise your trunk, elephant! Come on, you scoundrels! Come on! I'll kick you all! You bloody... Come forward if you dare! Come on! Sir, they didn't let us feed bananas to the elephant. - Move away! What's the problem here? Who is causing trouble here? - There's no problem here, sir. It's just a small tussle. A small disagreement between the local people and the mahouts. That's all. How did a disagreement end up injuring his head? It's not that, sir. His skull is slightly injured. But we have solved that. He's lying, sir. I will say the truth. - Kannan! You keep quiet, Dad. This isn't like what you think. Sir, some of us friends were just hanging out here. And a friend of ours went to feed bananas to the elephant. And that guy hit on his head without any provocation, sir. They are drunk, sir. - Aren't you drunk then? It's the festival, sir. Who isn't drunk here? Sir! This rascal is lying. This issue became worse only because they were trying to bully us. Who is the mahout? - It's me! Why? So who is he? - It's our elephant. We've taken this elephant on lease. Hey! Move the elephant to an empty space. Go! - No way, sir! You should charge a case! They have hit him on his head and injured him! No, dude. Let it go. - Leave me. Sir! They are outsiders. We won't let anyone put up such a show and disrupt this festival, sir. Hey! First you stop showing off! Move! - Sir! Sir! Sir! Come here, sir. - Leave it, Kannan. We don't need a case now. Just calm down. Move! Make way! Come, sir. Look, sir. Ask that Dasettan. Things are happening smoothly without many troubles here, only because of Dasettan. Isn't that so, Dasetta? - Namaste, sir. Isn't this Kachambar Dasan? Yes! - Of course! What are you waiting for? Catch him! - Pindi, I'll get back at you for this! What did I do? - Dasettan is running away. Let's go. Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run fast! Aren't you chasing him, sir? Don't come behind me. Run in some other direction! Run in different directions. - Dasetta, go fast! Take the elephant away. All of you leave. - Come on! Don't create a ruckus here. Go! - All of you leave. Just go! We will go. Stop messing around and get going! Stop staring and take the elephant away. Let's go! Dasetta, don't look. The police are coming after us. They are right behind us. Shine! Jerish! Come on! The mahouts hit Vinu Chettan on his head and injured him! Which mahout? The guys who came with the elephant to the temple. Isn't he the mahout? Yes. - Catch him! Catch him! - I didn't hit anyone. I was just drinking here. Oh my God! They haven't caught Dasan yet? Where are you running off to? - Where are you running off to, Dasetta? Move! - Dasetta, happy birthday! - Go to hell! Catch him! Stop there! Wherever these guys go, I'm the one who ends up being chased. Oh no! The police is here? Boss! Boss! What's the problem? - Shut up and go away, Jolly. Is it my fault now? Lali, what was the problem? It's nothing. Just a small fight. So that was the problem? I'll have to escape from here too. What? Are you standing guard here? Get going! Go! Go! Go give them directions. - Okay. Kannan... I've arranged some goons. But we can't do anything until we get those guys away from the elephant. Will Balan and boys reach now? - Yes. Even if they come or not... other teams are coming with weapons. Hey! Don't keep gaping! Come here. Come here. What's happening? They are still there. Right next to the elephant. Let's plan the next move without wasting time. Kannan, we should hit them back! They shouldn't leave from here, come what may! This is my loss alone! They don't let good actors come up! Surendran, aren't you ready yet? The drums performance is over, right? Go, put on your make-up. Why should I put on make-up now? The festival came to a halt, right? What? What happened? Now there's no Sugreevan or Surendran! I quit! - Hey! He will get us beaten up. - Hey soldier! Move away! Hey! What is it? What happened? Some lunatics had a huge fight at the festival ground. The committee members are saying that they will stop the festival. But I couldn't even perform as Sugreevan! Hari, can we take this festival forward? So far they were pestering us to bring an elephant. Now when we brought it, they want to chase it away! It's the priest. What's wrong, priest? President... Just because the festival came to a halt, we can't stop the rituals. What do we do now, President? President, I have paid money. I need a receipt. Come here, Chetta. I need a receipt. - Take him away. Give him the entire receipt book. Get going! Priest, the festival here was conducted without an elephant, so far. So let it continue to happen without an elephant. We needn't disrupt the existing rituals and customs for that. You can go to the temple, priest. The festival has come to a halt anyway. Why don't we start the drama then? They've all grown soggy in that dressing room. Where? Over there. - Are they ready? Yes. - Then why are you coming behind me? Ask them to start the drama! Go! - Come, let's go. Useless fellows. Surendran is leaving. - Hey Surendran! Where are you going? Go to hell. I am leaving. - Go change your clothes, Surendran. Why should I change now? Now there's no Sugreevan or Surendran! The festival has stopped, right? - You bloody... Go wear your make-up, for the drama. It isn't cancelled? - No, you idiot. Is the drama still on? - Yes. Come! Jibuji, Sugreevan has come back! 'The drama 'Sugreevan's Army' which didn't happen yesterday, due to certain technical reasons, will begin shortly' Buy one, Chetta. - What's the price? 20 Rupees. - Give me one. Hey! Come here. Where did those mahouts go? 'Rukmini Dance Troupe welcomes you all to our latest performance' [Drama announcement continues] Hey Eby! My dear Egan, it's a whole mess out here. Get going! Escape. - Calm down. You come here. 'The drama will start from the next bell onwards' 'Sugreevan's army' [Drama performance in progress] Hey! Where are you going? To give some water, sir. - What? To give some water to the mahouts. - To whom? To the mahouts. Give it and get going quickly. Don't hang around there. - Yes, sir. All the local people are against us. Think about how we will escape from here. Damn it! - What? - Have some water. Have some water. - Brothers, we're saying this out of concern, it's dangerous to stay here for long. You might end up in trouble. Get going. We've arranged a boat. You both can escape from here in that. Let the assistant mahout stay here. They want you guys only! We're not coming. You guys carry on! Is it? Chetta, shall I come with you? - You're coming? Hey! Get lost! Jolly, you stay here. Hey! Hey! You want to take us to the river bank and beat us up, right? I know that you guys weren't calling us out of your concern for us. You guys get going! Go! Go! We'll get you guys before the festival ends! You heard me? - Get lost! Get going! So you were planning to take me there and beat me up? Get lost. - We'll see you soon. We'll see you! - Aren't you going? Go with them. - I'm not going. - Why don't you go? No! I'm not going! I'm going only to Dubai. - He wants to go to Dubai. I'm not going. If I don't go, the problem is solved, right? Hey! Why are the police here? What's the problem? Why are the police here? - One bro punched on the head of a dude here. It became a huge issue. The festival is stuck. The whole programme is jammed. His bones are damaged! The festival is a wash-out. The police asked that dude to stay away. Look! That's.... all! Go and check where our boys are. - I'll go. - Chetta! Chetta, was there any problem here? - What? Was there any problem here? Those outsiders came and injured one of our boys' head. That became an issue. That's what. Who are you? - I am their friend. Whose? His? That guy? The mahout? His friend. You were his friend? - Yes. Come with us! Come on! Were you his friend? - Put me down. I'm not his friend. I said that unknowingly. Put me down. Put me down! - Come on! Oh my God! They are taking me! We will beat you to pulp. - Let me go! Shut up! Hit him! Call your friend, man! I don't know him. - Call them both! You'll be thrashed! Call them! Take your phone out! If you don't want to get beaten up, call them. If they don't come here now... we will finish you! Call them! Or it will be your funeral tonight! Yes. Call them. Call. Hello? - Hello? Where are you? - Dude... The local people here have caught me. They will leave me only if you come here. Didn't I tell you to escape from here? I was just asking them what happened here. Now you've understood what's happening here, right? Yes, I've understood now. - Damn it. Please come here. - Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? - What? Oops. My phone fell down. Move away! Catch him! - He's running away! Catch him! Who are you? - Egan. Get lost, you losers! Don't hit me! Oh no! Let him go. We'll go to them. Hello? He's gone! I'll call you back. He doesn't know me well enough. Killing Bali is not so easy. Jibuji... - Yes. Sugreevan is too much! Drama is perfect for you. - Give it to me. Hey! That's enough. Leave some. You're good at war. I don't think this would be enough. Brahma is about to appear. Come! Don't finish it! Go! Go! - Go and buy another one. Now I have to fight with Brahma? Where is Brahma? Here comes Surendran! No! Sugreevan! Brahma will be finished today! [Drama in progress] Hey! Do you have a matchbox? No, Boss. That's okay, dude. Let him go. Let him go. - Hey! Hey Kaali, go in quickly! Hey brother in a tee shirt? Do you have a matchbox? Don't roam around there. Come here. Near the bridge. Come fast. - Son... Do you have a matchbox? - Ask someone there. Yes, dude. We are here. We are behind the stage. Where were you? - Matchbox, please. Come fast. Everything is okay, right? Tell me when you reach. We're waiting. Don't wait until the drama is over. As soon as they reach, destroy everything! I won't let the drama or the festival happen. I will ruin everything! Chetta... Here's your lighter. Oh my God! Hey! Cut Kaali's scenes! Let's go straight to the mace fight and finish the drama! Hey! Don't you have anything to say now? Are you happy now that they put a crown on your head? We should have beaten and chased them away in the morning itself. Kannan, I want to hit him! I want to break his face! We shouldn't just hit him. We should put a hole in his head. They were showing off with the elephant so far, right? We'll give it back to them and the elephant! No one will go out from the festival ground. We'll deal with their vehicle first. Hey! Come on! - Kannan, come! Destroy it! Hit it! Destroy everything! Break it! Hey! Lali is going on calling. It's some complicated mess! Shit! Calls are not going through! This guy's such a nuisance. Yeah, tell me. Hello Soniyetta? Where are you? I am at Kuravankodu Junction. Soniyetta, there's a small problem here. - What? I had to a hit a guy on his head during the festival. The entire town is against us. We might be attacked from all sides. I've no idea what to do. Is it? Let me enquire about the situation. You wait there. I'll come there. Okay, Chetta. What happened? - Soniyettan said he'll enquire and come here. Soniyettan said he'll enquire and come here. Find out where that driver Sathyan went. Boss, should I go alone? Take the elephant with you then. - Huh? Just go, Jolly. Hold this stick. When the vehicle gets here, we'll get the elephant in it and get going. Don't bother about anything else. - Okay. [praying] Hey Jyothish, don't let anyone in their gang escape. We must lock them here once the drama is over. We're bringing goons for that, right? Kannan and his boys said they will come there, right? They are already there. The vehicle is in showroom condition, huh? Hey! Where will they come? - They are not picking up the phone. They will come now. Where are they? - They said they will call once they reach that junction. After they reach the junction. - Try calling them. Try calling them. Hey! Hey! Hey! Over here! Hey! Hey! Hey! Jesus, save this Jolly alone! Where's the stuff? Hey! Is everything okay? - I've locked everything. Come. - Hey! Hold this. Ask those boys who fed the bananas to come here. And send some of the goons who have come now, to the farms. Come. - Got it? - Yes. You go to the temple. - Okay. If that elephant isn't there, we can thulp them. The elephant is not an issue. This elephant can be messed up by an ant! - They are here. Hey, come here. - Where are the mahouts? They are right under the elephant. Are the weapons ready? Yes, they are in the van. - Which way will the others come? They will reach Kuravankodu junction. - They are in front of the temple. They can escape through the farms. - Vinu! Huh? - Come here. Where is Kannan? I don't know where Kannan is. Hey! I'll make something very clear. If you're going to continue that fight here, neither me or the people here would be with you. Remember that. - Don't try to mess things up. We were the ones who were beaten! We know how to give it back. - Then go there. Go get it from them. Let's go. Move! Move away. - Good for nothing fellows. Vinod, some of you go to the farms. You can block them there. Get in. Let's go. Kanaketta... Check who has come. - Okay. Who's that? - Kanaketta, it's me, Jyothish. Don't break it open. I am coming. It's me, Chetta. It was you? Come. Come inside. Throw that cigarette outside. Close the door. On whose chest do you want to burst this? The fireworks aren't so grand this time. So we thought we'll burst some ourselves. You can light it, burst it or do whatever the hell you want. Hey! Here. No one should come searching for Kanakan's house at the end of it. Give it here. Hey! No one's going to come here and trouble you, because of this. Let's go. Come. It's been only 6 months since I got out of jail. I'm not so interested to go back there so quickly. Understood? No, Chetta. - Get going. Why can't he understand? There are some 12 cases against him! Hold it away. Will this burst now? Show it to me. Give it. What are you waiting for? Throw it! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Take it away and burst it. Don't put me in trouble! We were just testing it. Stop gaping and get going! Kannan! - What is it? We've got the stuff. - Do one thing. Go straight to the temple. I will come there. We should burst this in their throats! - Yes. Coming. Come, let's go. Sir, there's a small problem. The President is calling you to the office. What? - Please come to the committee office, sir. Okay, let's go. Hey! Come here. What is it? - I can smell some trouble. What happened? - I'll go check. Jolly has gone, right? Let him come back. He is useless. I'll be right back. - Don't do anything unnecessary. You stay with the elephant. - Let me go this way and check. What if we can take the elephant out through this route? - Calm down. It's okay. Lali.. - Listen to me. Hey! Lali.. - I am all right. What happened to you? Hey Soni! Bloody drunkard! Get lost! I'll see you later! Hey Sanal, come here. - Soni? Hey! I've enquired about the situation. I can't create an issue inside the temple. If they say that I disrupted the festival, that's bad for me. Hey! We are going to do something. You guys should escape in that gap. Me and my boys will be at the junction after the turning. If you reach there with the elephant, then I'll take care of you. Okay. Hey! Come here. What did Sonichettan say? Sonichettan will be at the junction. We should reach the junction somehow with the elephant, through those farms. They've brought in goons here. We should escape from here, at the earliest. Stop wasting time. Let's get going somehow. Isn't there any light here? - There was. Where is the President? - He is inside, sir. President! There's no one here. President! Where is the President? You brought me here to fool me? No, sir. Leave me. Leave me. Don't mess with me. Don't mess with the police. Open the door. - Didn't you take his phone? Don't come behind me. Go somewhere else! Garudan, fly! - Will your dad give me wings? Where has the President gone? Chechi, don't go there. There's a fight happening there. There he is. Hey! Chetta, there's a huge fight happening near the stage. Who's that? - Some new gang. Who's that now? Isn't the police there? Go fast. They will kill each other now. - They won't let me conduct this festival. What are you saying? Who is fighting there now? Come on! Prashant, pull him away. - Who is he? Who are you? Take them away! - Pull them away! Who are you guys? - Move away! [inaudible arguments] Who are you guys? President! - Pull them away! Let's call the police. Move! Lali, some other gang has started a fight there. They have wrecked our truck. Sathyan is missing. That's Soniyettan's team. This is for us to escape. Come on, set the elephant free. Unchain it, Jolly. - Yes. Come on! Come on! Turn left, elephant. Jolly, set the elephant free. - I am doing it, Boss. Come on, elephant. Parthan! Come on, trample them! Parthan, come fast. Parthan, come on. Walk! Push it down, Parthan. - Move away! Come on! Come on! Come closer if you dare! Come on, lock us! Johnny, stab them! Come on. Come forward, elephant! Parthan, stab them all! Chase these pigs away with your trunk! Hit them! Push it down, Parthan! Yes! Like that! Come on! Come fast. - Parthan, come fast. Run! Run, Parthan! Parthan, run! Their problem isn't over yet? Jibuji, escape! The elephant is coming! Oh no! My coloured lights! Come on! Parthan! Come, Parthan. Lali, come on. Move left, elephant! Come, Parthan! Come on! Come on! Come! Come with me, Parthan! Come! Throw them! Parthan, uproot it. Hit them with it, Parthan! Move away! Escape! Come on! Come on! Lali, catch the elephant. The elephant has gone that way. Leave me! Kick him! Lali! Hey! Dasan, are you tired? A little, sir. I ran a lot, right? Shall we go then? - Of course. Let's go meet the S.I. - Let's go then. Come on. Go ahead, sir. - Come on! Walk, sir. You don't have to hold me. I've surrendered, sir. I'm tired. I can't run anymore. - Let's go. Chetta, are you going to the town? - Yes. Will you drop me at the town? Calm down, elephant. - Will your problem be solved if you reach the town? Yes. But my problem won't be solved. Hop on! Call me when you reach. - I will call you. Come on, elephant. Okay. - Come on, walk. Come on! Chetta, stop here. Why did you take this route? Well, I heard that my boys had a fight with some outsiders. I have to go finish it. - I'll get down here then. If you cross this way, you can reach the town, right? It's all right, Chetta. I will manage. Will you? - Yes. Okay. Hail Lord Siva. Devotees, please pay attention. The closing procession of Aranjali Mahadeva temple festival will begin soon. 'Ajagajaantharam'
