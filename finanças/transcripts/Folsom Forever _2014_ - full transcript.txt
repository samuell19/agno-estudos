[Narrator] The Golden Gate is more than a romantic name. It is truly America's gateway to the Pacific, to Alaska, to Hawaii, protected from wind and sea by surrounding hills, gleaming like snow in the sun. The fauns have tempered the climate of this land, conditioned its development, and perhaps even affected the character and vigor of its people. (funky music) - Everything seems to be falling into place, we've got the toilets dropping now, the dumpster vendor is here, yeah we've got pretty much headquarters all set up and we're already working on the fairgrounds, we're probably a little ahead of schedule. Folsom Street Events is actually a freestanding nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California. We are a mostly volunteer-run organization that produces worldwide leather and fetish events. We also take all of our net proceeds and give them to charity and the end of each year. Everything is going really well, we're pretty much on track. We've closed all the major inbound streets right now and we've got A & R Booths setting up most of the booth structures and they're actually getting quite a bit done. I've seen probably every major leather and fetish event in the world now and there's nothing of this size and nothing that nears the diversity of Folsom Street Fair anywhere. It just doesn't exist. And then "MT" is where you drop the stage. - Okay. - All right, do you wanna keep that? - Yes. - Okay. There's room to grow and change things every year. One of the things we wanna make sure we don't do is produce the same exact fair, year after year. When it hits 10:30, 10:45 and the first fairgoers start arriving, that they feel like the fair is really put together. Yeah, we don't want them to see a work in progress. - There was this song when I lived in France, that was playing on the radio, that was if you come to San Francisco, make sure to put some flowers in your hair. ("San Francisco" by Scott McKenzie) And to me that was like the call to the fun kind of life and the fun kind of freedom that I felt I didn't have, even though I was part of the Parisian culture, I wanted something different. So, I went after it. - In the 60s I was just one soldier in the army of us who began to occupy Folsom Street. But as a journalist, I kept diaries and notes, and photographs and Super 8 films to document what was going on, because all of us at that time realized what was unfolding, when it was beginning and what was happening when it was at its height. Couldn't last forever. - I kinda was known in San Francisco as being Mr. Benefit because I never charged for benefits and I did thousands of them. Isn't it great here? It's so nice to see so many people turn up for an airplane meeting. (laughter) This isn't about money... Bullshit. I love the idea of community service, of helping the community and doing stuff. - My major research has been on gay South of Market, in San Francisco. And I've been doing this work since about 1978, when I came out to San Francisco to do a dissertation on the leather community, the gay male leather community in South of Market. - I don't know if it's crazy but I love a good circle jerk. You know, and there's lots of guys with just big, fat, pierced cocks, just standing around in circles, just yanking on it and yanking on each other. - I like to say that there are two political camps in San Francisco, left and lefter. Sometimes people who are lefter, will not be happy about those of us who're, they think aren't left enough, but we're all extremely left. - I didn't dive into leather, it came to me slowly in my process of acclimating to stay in San Francisco as my new home. - At a very young age I decided that that aesthetic, that gay male butch leather kinky aesthetic, was something I was attracted to. It was never even a question. So I've been active in the leather community since I was 18 years of age. - I literally landed in San Francisco on the weekend of Folsom Street Fair in 1996. I got to my new residence, put my bags down, and my roommate said, "Okay come on, we're taking to you to a street fair." And I thought okay fun, great, what is this gonna be about? I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The city has recognized that there are hundreds of thousands of people that are descending on San Francisco for this week and this weekend. (funky music) - We are from France, we are here for three weeks. - [Voiceover] Where do you guys come from? - Australia. - Australia. - Switzerland. - Switzerland. - One of our friends said, "You have to be there today, "because it is a huge event." So, we are here. - Oh it's really famous all over the world I think, yeah. - [Voiceover] Do they know what they're getting themselves into? - Not really, no. - I've heard that it's a crazy fair where people do whatever they want. - I don't know, what did I tell you guys? - Not much. Not much. - Mike invited me and I was just like, why the hell not? - I've heard some of it like it's kinda violent, but, interesting (laughs). So it's good, I don't know, it's interesting being a voyeur sometimes. - To avert his eyes (laughs). At certain points. - [Woman] Maybe. - Because I've gotta play host to 400,000 people now, I've gotta look cute and be on and make sure my eyebrows are okay. (electronic music) - This is Mark Leno, I have the great privilege of representing San Francisco in the State Senate, and I'm just here to say welcome to Folsom Street Fair. It's as beautiful and imaginative, creative and good for the city's finances, as you can imagine. (electronic music) - My mom used to wear leather all the time, and I used to think that that was just the hottest thing on her, it was just so beautiful. And little did I know that when I grew up I was gonna be so into leather, the smell of it, the feel of it, the sexual energy that I get from wearing it and just the kinkiness and the playfulness. - So we have a circus coming, I hope you will find it very sensual, and so (mumbling) as we are. - I am Zagasm, the ultimate orgasm of divine connection to the universe. These are actually my synapses. - Oh, hello. - In our company, orange is the color of laughter, so friend Shickle is just sitting here, to bring laughter and joy to everybody. - San Francisco is really where I've made my home, I've traveled and lived all over the world but San Francisco is where when I put my feet down here, I realized these are my people and this is the place that I belong. Well in 2007 my father passed away and what I haven't talked about is that shortly before he passed away he had a sex change and became a woman, and then died of cancer. And so he lived his whole life in this body that didn't belong to him. Had this very brief period of time in which he was moving into becoming a woman, and then this life was cut short. And so, about two months later, Folsom arrives and I'm in mourning, and mourning the loss of what I didn't have, which is this relationship with this person that I never knew and I go to Folsom Street Fair and in a way it was sort of this launchpad for me. And looking back over the years of Folsom, it's so ironic that I step onto this platform of Folsom with my own personal journey that I'm going through and it has become this symbol for me of celebrating, celebrating diversity and taking the shame out of it. (electronic music) (laughter) - It's a bummer too. It's called dildo ring toss. The point is to get the rings on the dildo. And if you get it then you can win prizes like lube, condoms, material, porn. It's all about promoting safe sex and healthy styles of life. - Have you been naughty? Very naughty? You're at Folsom, explore. Are you gonna go home and have some vanilla ice cream, and go, "Oh my God, I could've lived, "but no, I really like beige." (moaning) - Is that good for you? - Yeah (laughs). - Oh (laughs)! (electronic music) - The stages are good there's no question about it. I think the whole fair is entertainment, not just the stages. - San Francisco music in particular has been very important to who we are and what we do, and so tried since our beginnings to offer some insight into the San Francisco music scene. And that has included bands from Imperial Teen, that have their roots here, to The Limousines, who are being featured this year. - Demetri is a huge fan of indie bands and contemp... like interesting new musical acts, so he's doing his best to bring in really interesting people. - When we were brainstorming about the 25th anniversary people were like bring in Cher, bring in Madonna. But those acts, even if we could afford them, wouldn't necessarily speak to our core audience because they're fairly mainstream acts.

In little more than a century, it has grown from a frontier town into a mature metropolis. - [Gayle] South of Market actually was a viable neighborhood it was a just working class neighborhood and it was poor. After World War II, the industry and the working class population start to leave as industry and the population suburbanizes, so this is the kind of neighborhood that is ideally positioned for urban renewal. That is, it's near central, the central downtown, central business district and yet it's very cheap. You had to call a neighborhood blighted. Blight was the key word, the key to the kingdom in a way of urban renewal, so, I think it's '52, the redevelopment agency sends in a team to do a report of South of Market and they decide that it's really very blighted. (sad music) Early 60s the redevelopment agency is given the power, they come into South of Market. (anticipating music) Particularly the area around what is now Moscone Center. They buy up the land, they forcibly, they forced people to sell the land, they start evicting people, they start demolishing these buildings, they destroyed lots of the low-cost housing in the city. - [Voiceover] The business vitality of San Francisco in recent years has brought radical changes to the city's skyline. The old houses stand in timid contrast, as if wondering when they too, must give way to progress. - And it's at that moment of neighborhood disruption that is sort of the beginning of the gay occupation. (funky music) The old taverns and working class lunchrooms and bars have pretty much closed so there's all these places that could be rented or bought, and enterprising businessmen start to open them as leather bars. - Among all the varieties of gay people coming out of the closet, no one expected masculine identified gay men to come marching out of the closet as well. People thought, they didn't exist. - The homosexuals were stereotypically considered to be effeminate and sissies, and there were gay men who were not. Who were masculine in their gender orientation and many of them wanted other masculine men as partners. Leather became a way that those kinds of men could carve out some space in gay, within the gay population. - But you really had to kinda choose your camp. There were leather men, there were drag queens, there were, what we now would call young twinks, club kids, and that was kind of it. There really were no other buckets into what you could place yourself, however you felt comfortable. A lot of the gay men who rode motorcycles were attracted to them for a variety of reasons, they loved bikes, they loved the semiotics, they loved the things that bikers wore. - From the beginning, leather was very male identified, the whole point was to emulate masculine men. Men from 1940s, veterans riding motorcycles in the 40s, and on through the 50s and 60s, it was always about the masculine look. - [Voiceover] It's the disco group "Village People" a long way from water and their native New York City. 75 miles in the California, Rattlesnake Country, the middle of the Mojave Desert and with them, a studio full of high price backup, cameras, reflectors, makeup people, technicians and who knows who else. - [Glenn] Basically what we're shooting is the fulfillment of the role models that these guys play. As you can see, the construction guy has his piece of equipment, the cowboy and the Indian have their horses and it's the ultimate manifestation of their roles. The appeal of the group is based on the very simple premise, that there's something out there for everybody. - You know I like fatigues and all, and I decided to build on it. - Like kids when you were growing up man, everybody wanted to be a cowboy or in the army, that's what Village People is about. - In my own personal experience, the BDSM has always kind of been there. It wasn't, even necessarily separated out as a separate thing. It was kind of part of the sort of biker leather culture that I came out in. Nobody was shocked when they saw fisting happening. Nobody was shocked when somebody was pissing on someone else, it just wasn't surprising. It kinda came with the territory. - When the 1964 article in LIFE magazine showed up in my parents' mailbox, just a week before my 25th birthday, with that article on the Tool Box and the mural of the Tool Box and about manly men who inhabited the Tool Box. - [Gayle] The Tool Box opened at the corner of Fourth and Harrison, and on the ground floor of what was, from what I can tell, a working class tenement. It was the gay leather bar in South of Market and it was there for a number of years until it was torn down by the redevelopment agency in the early 1970s. This was part of the redevelopment area that includes Moscone Center and all of that, the sort of museum and arts complexes, and hotel complexes growing up around Moscone. - But that LIFE magazine was pivotal because it was like an official announcement sent out to America and to the world to the disenfranchised and wondering boys who knew they were gay but they weren't quite the same as the other gay boys, that here was the place to go. - There was not much of a social space for lesbians who were kinky until the 1970's. Mostly lesbian who were kinky still hung out on the margins of gay male and mostly heterosexual institutions. When the local leather dykes started to get organized was right around the same time that the feminist anti-porn movement was coalescing. (shouting) The women who were involved in leather and SM, really kind of were aware of the anti-porn movement much earlier than other, than gay men or straight SM people were. And really I think were more politically sophisticated about the implications of that for kinky people. - When I wanted to go to the leather bar, yes they wanted three pieces of ID. But maybe because I'm fearless, or I was crazy, I did get three pieces of ID, so I could get into the leather bar and you then think, well they don't want me there, and then, I can behave, and I was dressed right and I can behave. So I had some really lovely time in the bar and even going to the back room. - The clubs and the bars and the baths on Folsom became legendary places. We knew instantly they were legendary. We knew that we were inside something so unique that it probably had not happened on the earth since maybe the days of Ancient Rome. We knew it was a bacchanal, we knew it was exciting, it was risky, it was dangerous, but it was the most fun any of us had ever had. - I went down to South of Market on a weekend night, and I just thought this is amazing, I had never seen anything like it. All these guys in leather, hundreds of them, thousands of them, I didn't count them. On the streets, just hordes of people. And it was clearly just this scene that was really huge and viable. "That's Disgusting" is a breakthrough in male video entertainment. This tape shows you in living color what 24 hot San Franciscan men did with each other and four billiard balls, a bunch of bananas, an eight foot cord, three ceremonial samurai swords and greased hands, arms and cocks. Now you can see for yourself why San Franciscan men love to shock the world. - Well in 70s, which I call the titanic 70s, because we partied on. You know it was a first class party, just cruising on, not knowing that ahead laid the iceberg of HIV. We were all innocent of that. Leather sex did not kill anybody. A virus killed people. - [Gayle] The local press tends to blame AIDS for the closure, or the attrition of South of Market. And to assume that the attrition of the neighborhood, the retail and recreational complex in the neighborhood meant that the leather community was harder hit by AIDS than the other gay populations. This is probably not true. - Well of course, like any village looking for the witch who poisoned the well, the vanilla gays looked at the leather gays and said, "Hmm, we see all that sweaty, dirty, nasty "sex going on down South of Market, "that must be the cause of it." The city fathers and mothers paid attention to that too and pretty soon there was a movement afoot to close the bars particularly, the sex clubs, which were open after night. - Everybody wanted to declare a statement that would make themselves safe. - [Interviewer] Right. - Oh, well I'm not going to get it, because I don't, blank. - [Interviewer] Right. - You know, because everybody was questioning how, what caused it, so there was a lot of that kind of like, "But it's certainly, "I'm, no problem with me." - By '82, '83, '84, I mean it's really, the epidemic is just ravaging the local population. It's ravaging the entire local gay population including the Castro and the Polk, everywhere. But neither the Castro nor the Polk shows the kind of institutional attrition that's really evident in South of Market, where just places have closed like crazy. - At least for the male gay community, they were really scared and they were scared of sex, and they were scared of their sexuality. - [Reporter] When the AIDS crisis hit the Bay Area a year ago, reaction was strong and fearful. Gay men stayed away from the bars and bathhouses, and there was pressure to close them. Pressure to close the bathhouses continues however, although now, Health Department officials say, they are not the problem. - A study which we had done, the results of which we did not know until just very recently, indicates that 75% of those questioned coming out of bathhouses said they'd go somewhere else if they were closed, and do the same thing. So it's not where you do it, it's what you're doing. - [Reporter] Officials and gay leaders agree that was is needed is a long range change in the ways gay men have sex. Education and change are beginning with individuals and community groups, and also among the sex clubs and bathhouses. The owner of this club, an inconspicuous looking place on an alley in South of Market, says he sees an important role for gay sex clubs in the fight against AIDS. - [Hal] What I've been trying to do, is to use the club as a way of eroticizing forms of sexual activity which are, carry much less risk, and sort of make it fashionable to be concerned about how one relates to someone else to reduce the risk of disease. - [Gayle] The closure of the bathhouses was a political intervention that was said to be a public health measure, but it actually was a political intervention. If it had been argued on the basis of public health, it probably wouldn't have happened. But what it did do, was it destroyed a big piece of the gay economy in the neighborhood because all those bathhouses, there were, half a dozen or more in the neighborhood, they were big institutions, they had hundreds of customers every night. - But they had to destroy the very pleasure palaces of the 70s, in this horrible 80s uptight period. It was kind of a puritan reaction to the pleasure principle. An overreaction, and it was destructive. - And in a funny way, the closure of the bathhouses represented not just panic about AIDS and homosexuality, but also panic within the gay community about its own sex habits, and also the success of a certain number of influential figures. I mean it represented gay power in a way, because the gay community, elements of the gay community really supported closure. - Well, two years ago I was sitting in my store one day and got bored and decided to entertain myself by putting on a street fair and so I proposed the idea of a street fair and produced it. And it was somewhat successful. (indigenous music) (crowd muttering) And I think that's what a street fair should be, for the neighborhood, about the neighborhood and by the neighborhood. And someday we'll be there, thank you. - The first Folsom Street Fair actually wasn't a leather event at all, it was actually a South of Market neighborhood street festival that was supposed to bring a bigger spotlight to gentrification issues. - You have to remember, the fair starts in '84. So, this is the year that the bathhouses are closed, or much of the closure is happening, the campaign is happening, they're closed, '84, '85. Leather and gay institutions in the neighborhood are closing like mad, '84, '85. And that's when the fair starts. - I'm Kathleen Connell. (cheering) - One of the co-producers of the first annual Folsom Street Fair. - Kathleen Connell and Michael Valerio are, they start the fair in part because they're so aware of this process of urban renewal that's about to chew up what they are working with. Kathleen is working with low-income seniors, with food delivery services for them and Michael is working for TODCO with low-income senior housing. - And that was a big part of what they wanted to do, was to do something to show that we have a large senior population that's living downtown, you know, in not necessarily the best situation. - Both of them were really involved in, not just in gay activism, but in activism around housing and low-income seniors, particularly in Central City. - Kathleen and Michael were, they were just amazing together. They were so symbolical and they could make dreams happen. You know, and they did mine. I'll never forget it. - Like Folsom Street has really, really changed. I know it has because it said so in The Chronicle, so it must be true. (laughter) See, for years and years there was nothing on Folsom Street but real hardcore gay S&M bars, real tough S&M bars like The Ambush, and the Ramrod and the Bay Brick, real tough bars. (laughter) And see but now there's all these heterosexual fern bars. But you know, I just can't get used to seeing yuppie S&M, I really can't, you know. Lottie, come here, lick my boots. Oh God, you're domestic, eww. It's just... (laughter) They were talking about how there was gonna be a street fair, the Folsom Street Fair, and if you were interested, contact them. So, I called them and I met with Michael and Kathleen. And I said, you know, I don't just wanna perform for you, I would like to be a part of it, I'd like to help put it on and so we all worked together, we hit it off amazingly and, you know, immediately. - I have the program from the first year, Megahood. It's called Megahood because what they're trying to show, is that this was a mega hood. It was a real neighborhood, it wasn't just an empty space waiting to be developed with nothing happening, there were actually already people here. And they wanted to really make that statement. This is the program from the second year, it's called "Attack of the Street Faire" and they have this monster, they've decided Megahood is a monster, it's crawling out of one of the manholes here. - I said, "Well, we need to include the leather community", so I said, "Let's call Mr. Marcus, "the columnist for the Bay Area Reporter "for the leather community, "and have him get together leather titleholders "and put on a one hour leather fashion show "from all the leather shops, all around of Folsom." And so, we did that. - It was very much a community event. And it was always a charity event, that raised money for whatever charity, I think it was for the neighborhood, but then it became very much for all the AIDS, for the AIDS Foundation and it was a charity group that were trying to help people when people started really dying in mass. - Now for the first couple of years, it doesn't have a strong identity, except as an expression of the neighborhood. As the gay and leather presence starts to decline however, it becomes more and more of a focus. The population for whom this neighborhood is very meaningful starts to get more and more involved in the fair and it becomes more and more of a leather and gay and kinky event. - It was essentially from Seventh to Eleventh but with gaps. You know it was kind of small event, it wasn't, you know, you could actually still walk the streets and not be, at three o'clock in the afternoon you could still be mobile on those streets and not be packed into this crowd like a sardine can, moving slowly down the street. - After about the second year there weren't no gaps. And it was going up to Howard and going down to Harrison. (indistinct speech) - I remember that it was probably the most exciting day of my summer. - In the morning of Folsom Street Fair you go nuts like what am I gonna wear? I mean, how much can I wear, or how little can I wear? And it was exciting and something to look forward to. - It was certainly some lesbians of certainly some heterosexuals. But the vast majority of people in attendance were gay men. - There were a lot of guys who were dressed up and out for a sunny afternoon and wearing their harnesses or wearing less. And there wasn't a lot of nudity in those days, the nudity movement was a later movement. - There were people with kids in strollers and there were guys in their leather harnesses and it was just kind of a neighborhood event. - Because we had such a small footprint in the early 80s, in general, getting together large groups of people and networking, you got to meet people from all over the country, all over the world, that were like you and it felt really good. - Remember, most of the kinky scene, the leather scene took place behind closed doors for a long, long, long time. So when Folsom Street Fair essentially brought that to the streets, it was revolutionary. That simply wasn't done before. Nobody walked the streets that openly. And that was one of its great powers at the time, was to give people this sense of pride that I can be kinky, I can be leather and I can walk the streets and be happy doing that, with my friends and not worry about ramifications, not worry about the police, not worry about being harassed. - We had organized a little team, where we're gonna walk, spinning a flogger in the same rhythm and the same pattern all together. It was actually Marx, the guy I talk about that took me to The Catacomb, was playing drum behind us. So we'd be doing figure eight and overhand and underhand. There was room for us to walk as a contingent swinging our whips in the street. Imagine this now, impossible. I mean it takes you an hour to go one block. - I do wanna say though that the leather community in Folsom was instrumental in the fight against AIDS here. I mean it was the leather community and leather women in particular that became caregivers, major fundraisers. - The women's community really did come up and participated in fundraising and certainly in caregiving in a way that we really, almost didn't deserve in a sense, because we really had not wanted them in our lives quite so much. - When you attended Folsom Street Fair, you had no judgment, you didn't judge people. You didn't judge the guys with Kaposi's on their face. You didn't judge the people that were walking with canes or walking slowly or very thin. - At some point there were people with Kaposi's sarcoma that were out in the daylight, they were just like this is it, this is what's going on, this is us. There was a sense of courage that was overwhelming. - I mean the Castro Street Fair for instance, I think people looked around and said "Wow, look at him, isn't that awful, "that's so sad." I don't think people did that at Folsom, I think people just said, "Hey, you're here, "let's live, I mean, this is an opportunity to live "and experience life, for however long or short it is," "do it man, just do it!" - We realized that BDSM and the kind of kinky sex that we have that is non-insertive, often, had the power to become sort of the uber safer sex. And it was essentially marketed that way. Do BDSM and you're safe. - While the Health Department in San Francisco by mid 80s was putting out more literature, the gay community was putting out it's own literature about having safe sex, or safer sex, and Drummer was also, tubthumping the same message. So all three of those messages coalesced by '86, '87. - BDSM was put forward as a really safe way to play and still be erotic and still be sexual without necessarily having insertive play. And in that way, I think, the leather community kind of stepped forward and made a name for itself in kind of promoting truly safer activities in an environment that otherwise wasn't at the time. - My response was fight back, and you know that's a very French response, is to fight back, you don't like something, strike against it, fight back. So go in the street, show how you feel. (cheering and applause) We walked as proud and as in leather as we could, Those of us who could have afford to be public. So I went down the street with my t-shirt from The Outcasts, which was a women SM group. I actually had a placard that says, "SM is safe sex." - We were placing front and center, what we do, as very safe, for the most part. - The leather community and the SM community, who already had rules and regulations about safe and sane and consensual sex were able to teach that to the community at large because we were already doing it. - I think the leather community was seen a little differently then. Because we were seen as the vanguards of promoting safer activities. And we did that overtly, intentionally. I think some people even did it in a sense, in a way to almost market the leather community to the rest of the world as, "See how responsible we are!" Because we are, we're incredibly responsible people. But I don't think many people saw that. - And just as Drummer would have a section in it, the Folsom Fair would have a booth with AIDS information being passed out. So the conscious grew in several levels and infused the whole leather society. And that caused people to move just from pleasure for pleasure's sake, to move into smart pleasure for smart pleasure's sake. (relaxing music) - I do wanna share with you also about Folsom Street Events, not just what we've helped to produce but how we make our money and how this relates to your time volunteering. As Jacob said, your ability to volunteer helps us to not have to pay staff and so we can take all of the money that we have raised from various mechanisms including sponsorship, the gate donations, beverage sales, ticket sales to our parties, and all of those exhibitors who line the streets. We take all of that income that those folks have paid and we can then turn it around and give it back to the organizations that you're volunteering for. So last year that meant that we were able to give away over $330,000. (cheering and applause) There's about an hour and a half long training that we require all of our volunteers to go through, we give them a whole lot of information and then we ask them to take that information and apply it on the day of the fair. There are about three to 400,000 people occupying the fair over 13 city blocks, it's a pretty big undertaking. It means actually that we're, it's been estimated that we're the third largest single day outdoor event in the state of California. I mean just to be clear, there are on the day of fair, 600 pairs of volunteers like you. There are also the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, there's also all of the beverage partners and those folks who are volunteering in those. So we have over 1,000 people on the day of fair contributing to its success in some way, shape or form. Most of our volunteers are assigned to security. So they will, after this general part, go to a specific security training on how to use the radio, how to work with the police department, how to address certain situations around lewd behavior, all of those things get covered in that security training. - I'm Jim, and that's Allison. I've been running security for 10, 11, 12 years now at Folsom. So who has never volunteered before or gone to the fair? Wow, a lot of new people, good that's great. Although it is an adult-oriented fair, and there may be a lot of people who are nude, nude is cool, nude is not lewd, if you see someone having sex however, and I'm not going to define sex for you, please tap them on the shoulder and say, "I'm sorry, you can't have sex on the street." (laughter) We should have a supply of Blow Buddies cards or other sex club cards that you might be able to give out or recommend, there are lots of bars on this street, they can go into a bar and have sex if they want to. I don't know why you want to, you know? - No. - But the point is that we don't want people having sex in the street. (electronic music) - I started out with sexy leather outfits and I started getting less and less and less until I got down to absolutely nothing at all. - I think San Francisco is going through a bit of a transition in terms of how the community has been viewing public nudity. - I don't remember seeing that many naked people before, like many, many years ago, (mumbling) was proud to show off their leather. - One year we went, where I was only MCing like for two hours and Brian and I were walking down the street in Folsom and it was all of the sudden like, Wow! You know? (crowd chattering) - Do I think nude is lewd? No, I think nude is sexy. Hey, that's how we came in this world, nude, we're all going out of the world nude, so we should have some fun in between. - You know, if it's a beautiful day and you feel good about your body and you wanna be nude, why not? - Any donations for the SWOP? We're asking for five to 10 dollars for Sex Worker Outreach Project. (electronic music) - [Demetri] There are a lot of San Francisco events that seem to attract a fair number of nudists. And ours is just one of them. - [Scott] Well, it suffices to say that that is, that public nudity is not an issue that I anticipated working on when I ran for office and certainly not one that I ever wanted to work on. - Our supervisor Scott Wiener is opposing the nudity on the basis that he thinks it's sexual. - Unfortunately as the guy who was elected to represent the Castro, among other neighborhoods, I was caught in middle of it, and no matter what I did, I was gonna have people who were happy and people who were unhappy. We've always had the random naked person wandering through, whether it was the Castro or another neighborhood, and frankly no one cared. Where the community has had problems is, the folks who tend to visit the plaza week after week after week in what seem to be fairly significant and growing numbers. - My name's Trey and I'm a local in San Francisco, I live in Twin Peaks, and I'm just supporting my local nudes out here, the straights, the gays, the everything in between. And so we're in the nude, in San Francisco, in the Castro, we're gonna walk to City Hall and have a blast. Join us. - It went from an occasional random occurrence to a seven day a week, every afternoon kind of occurrence. - Nudity is fine and permitted as long as one is not lewd, that is walking around with an erection or being pretty (mumbling), or screwing out in the street or something. - [Voiceover] You can't film here in front of the theater without a permit. Well, I don't care what it is, we're trying to run a business here. - [Voiceover] How about that space right there? - Bye bye. - [Voiceover] Because this is the gay community. - [Voiceover] Well you know what, we are very tolerant. - What do you, you're tolerant expressions of nudity? - [Voiceover] I'm tolerant of kids not being exposed to cocks in their face. - What they want to restrict is the nudity in regulars streets at regular time and how, you know, some people are complaining about this, that or the other thing. - It's so San Francisco to be free and to have that freedom of expression. And I always get nervous when they take away rights from people because I feel like there's a laundry list, and there's something at the top that's gonna be easy to tick tack but then what's next, you know, can you not be in drag in public? Can you not wear a feather boa? But you know like... - The argument that I've heard from some of the opponents that this legislation somehow attacks the spirit of San Francisco, really boils down to an argument that the spirit of San Fransisco is about being able to show your genitals in the middle of neighborhoods, on public sidewalks, public transportation and I just don't buy that. I think that it is very melodramatic and exaggerated. - But they have said though, that they're gonna make an exception for the fair. - They said that except for festivals, and they didn't say Folsom but they said street fairs and festivals, specifically thinking about Folsom and The Royale of course, that this rule will not be enforced there. That people could be as nude as they wanted during those events. - At the request of Folsom Street Festival, or Folsom Street Fair, I completely removed buttocks, so you can still show your butt if you want to, it doesn't include women's breasts. In the leather community if, you know, they can go to the fair and be naked, if they're walking around in their chaps, that's fine, because buttocks are included in the legislation, so we tried to take a very measured approach. - The aspect of the fair that relates to human rights is a really interesting one for us because we've never really seen ourselves as a political organization necessarily, but a lot of the things that we have done and produced have been politicized for us, and so a perfect a example of that is actually the production of the leather Last Supper poster that we did. - Outrage in San Francisco over an advertisement for a street fair celebrating sexual diversity. Conservative Christians feel the ad mocks the Last Supper with images of scantily clad men and women in place of Christ and his disciples. Organizers for the fair had this to say, "We hope that people will enjoy the artistry "for what it is, nothing more, nothing less." - This is the most holy, one of the most holy events in Christianity, and to mock it this way is insulting. By portraying Christ and his disciples as homosexual sadomasochists, as if that's not offensive enough, they then take the bread and wine representing Christ's body and blood and replace with sadomasochist sex toys. I mean it doesn't get any more offensive and disgusting than that. - I mean, da Vinci was arguably a homosexual himself, and so we were looking at it really as a way of taking a very well known piece of art and making it our own, making it a statement about us. And so what was interesting to me is that the religious right picked up on it and all of the sudden it became us making a statement about them. - We're asking Nancy Pelosi, Senators Feinstein and Boxer and Governor Schwarzenegger to publicly condemn this. - [Voiceover] Well, I think they should. - Ironically it was actually probably the biggest fair that year because of all of that hype, we ended up on CNN and Nancy Pelosi had to make a statement about Folsom Street Fair, which was fairly embarrassing because she's a busy woman, she doesn't have time to make statements about a fair in San Francisco. - [Rick] We have given the gay community everything they have asked for, and now we basically have suspended the laws of the land, so that they can go out in the middle of the street, in public, and do what they're doing at the Folsom Street Fair. I have friends that are gay and they wouldn't be in the same ZIP code with this crap. - In some ways, it's still our most loved poster by the community, but not because it pissed off anybody but because it embraced the side of ourselves that they had never seen before. - Some people have asked me, "Well does this surprise you, this is San Francisco, "where they tolerate anything." First of all let me say, there should be a limit to tolerance. - This pleasure principle that we have is something that they deny in their puritanism. And that comes out of our expression of civil rights. Because civilly, we have rights to things that religiously people say we do not. And because it's the kind of an ultimate civil fair, it withstands all this moral majority bullshit. - [Rick] San Francisco may be lost, I don't know. And at this point I really don't care. (electronic music) - Welcome to the world famous Folsom Street Fair ladies and gentlemen, donations are being accepted for major charities throughout the area. Welcome, welcome to the world, this time on Earth. Pull your cocks out boys pull your cocks out. It's like peanut butter and jelly baby. You know when you come to the fair, you're gonna walk up the gates and you're gonna see the nuns there with buckets and you're gonna give us your money, because that's what we do. - Donations! - So when people come up and they see that there's a suggested donation, quite often, people are tempted to ignore that and walk through. But when you see a Sister with a bucket, suggesting. People have, you know, we've worked really hard for a reputation so that people trust us, I mean The Sisters are 33 years old, and we have made our public records very available to people, they know what we do with our money and they know they can trust us. - [Voiceover] Another gate over here. - [Voiceover] Hi, yeah, we can take your donations right over here. - We'll take your money, your pants. - Hi, hello. - [Voiceover] Hi, thank you very much, any change for the man? (crowd chattering) - [Voiceover] Thank you very much. - [Voiceover] That's all I have in my wallet. - [Voiceover] Okay, fabulous. (crowd chattering) - So we're working here in the treasury, and treasury is our central accounting location and we bring in here all of the gate donations that come in. (crowd chattering) As our gate volunteers and the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence that we work with, work our gates and ask all of our people coming in, our guests coming in, for donations, then all of that moneys comes back into the treasury that we can count that, sort it out and make a proper accounting for it. It takes a fair amount of money to put on this fair, but at the same time we do everything that we can to bring as much of it back down to the community. - Saturday before Folsom is by far the busiest day of the year, it's like Christmas in the Castro (laughs). We cater to the leather community, mostly year-round. So before Folsom Street Fair the whole week is busy, but Saturday before, crazy busy. It's been a line all day long. - Folsom weekend is very much Christmas time for our retail business, it's our high holy day, we see thousands and thousands of people come through the store and it's a really big deal. It takes a long time to plan for. - There's tens of thousands of people that come to San Francisco for Folsom Street Fair and so the restaurants, the stores, the buses, the taxis, the hotels, everybody benefits from the Folsom Street Fair, it's pretty cool. - As I was driving around, seeing lines outside at The Eagle and seeing lines outside The Powerhouse and people I know are packing the restaurants. I think the overall impact of the event on the community is huge down here in this zone especially. - Well, I'm Jeff and I own BrainWash, a cafe and laundromat, here in San Fransisco on Folsom Street. People come from all over to attend, they usually spend more than just the Sunday here, so we start seeing business pick up around Wednesday or Thursday and people stay through Monday and then they leave, so it's about a five day bump in our business. So, it's definitely good for the neighborhood. - The city can be non intentionally but unintentionally hostile in terms of the fee set of charge and some of the pure crack hoops you have to jump through. And at Folsom just like other large street festival has had to deal with some of those challenges and one of my goals is to try to improve that process and not just pass on all costs to the festival for police or whatever cause I can end up killing the festival making it economically unsustainable. - I think overall, Folsom Street Fair has had a very positive impact on the community and there are many reasons why, I think. It's just not the money that we raise and then donate to the community, but I think there's the greater economic impact, I believe there was a study done in 2004 from an independent audit group called The Mariposa Group, and they estimated that San Francisco Leather Week generated approximately $35,400,000 in revenue. And that's revenue not just for the city, but you know, all the airfares, hotels, restaurants, the places where people go to shop and eat. And now it's that time where we start to give out your checks. (cheering) So if you have any complaints, let's talk tomorrow. No, I'm just kidding. (laughter) The next group I know is here, Golden Gate Wrestlers. (cheering and applause) - We're a 501(c)(3), a nonprofit, we've been one for almost 20 years and we basically run a wrestling program in the city for kids and adults, out of the rec center. But we are a nonprofit and we have to raise money in order to survive, because we can't charge the kids, we can't charge our members. Folsom offers us the opportunity to raise the money with the beer booth so that we can offer the scholarships and the uniforms to the kids, and to let them know that we coach. - We provide benefits counseling and employment services to low-income, HIV-positive and mental health clients. - We serve meals to people who are sick. It's such a basic need and we can't do what we do without the help of Folsom Street Events. Two dollars provides a meal to one of our clients, and so when we get a grant from Folsom Street Events we can provide meals to thousands and thousands of our clients as a result of that. - Well over the years we watched government contracts shrink and yet the need for our services increase. So every year we're looking for the support and the kindness and the generosity of organizations like Folsom Street Events, to help us provide the services to so many who may not receive it otherwise. (crowd chattering) - As a 501, we can't do anything with that money but give it back to the kids. They go to summer camp, they go to the John Smith Summer Camp in Oklahoma for wrestling. We get them uniforms. These are kids from the ghetto, who had never had anything. And now they're like the number two team in the city. - So for the 200 clients we see on a daily basis and the well over 2000 that we see over the year, we just wanna say thank you to the board and the staff of Folsom Street Events for their generosity and their kindness and they do it with fun involved as well, and we love that. - [Gayle] Certainly it's an international tourist event for kinky people of all persuasions, all genders and orientations. And we'll have to see where it goes, I can't imagine what the future is. But it will be interesting to watch. - We now have the trademarks in 47 of the 50 US States, Canada, the EU and Australia. Folsom Europe has now been around for about, I think eight or nine years and it's always been in Berlin. (electronic music) Their street festival though is entirely different than ours. Folsom Europe, when you go to their street fair, it's on a quaint little neighborhood kind of side street. - [Voiceover] Hey now, come on, come on, pick it up darling. Oh yeah, oh yeah. - [Demetri] Everyone is in head-to-toe leather, rubber, uniforms, everyone is fully dressed. In San Francisco, there's a lot of nudity. Theirs is predominantly male, I think I saw maybe five women all day at their street fair. Whereas Folsom Street Fair here is probably 25% women. - It's been eyeopening, educational, lots and lots to see and I feel, I'll definitely come back. - Very free place, everybody here looks different, nobody bothers, you can wear what you want. - The freedom to do and wear what you want and to have your own opinions and not be suppressed. We need something like this in Ireland as well. - We need something like this in England, (laughs), - Definitely. - What it puts out there, is that these things really do exist everyone is okay with it, it's not a bad thing, and I think it teaches people to accept it more. You know, it kind of shows the world that you can top from the bottom, so to speak. - It's an institution that I hope will continue and will continue doing the good work it's doing. - [Scott] This day, you can do whatever it is that defines who you are and it's okay. That's one of the things that Folsom means I think in San Francisco and around the world and it's always been that way and it's gonna continue to be that way. - Could it happen somewhere else, I don't think so. Do other people do it now? They sure do. - It's in our DNA, it's in our personalities to do these things, to act this out. You really can't, once you come out of the kink closet you really can't go back in, again. - Diversity and accepting diversity doesn't work if you only accept stuff that you can accept. Then what are you accepting? - [Voiceover] Right. - You're just saying, "Well, I'm comfortable with this, "so I'm comfortable with it." - We're supporting human rights, we're supporting what it is to be free. And we joined together as a force and what that would be if the different countries and the different cities can do that. Standing up not just for ourselves, but standing up for everyone. Because if we're denying human rights and equality for anyone within our community then in a way we're denying it for ourselves as well, we are so much bigger than just one person. - Everything that we've done in our past, everything we've done to get to where we are now, I wanna make sure that people from my generation are passing it along to the next generation and saying, "Hey, whatever is your kink, "just make sure to respect each other "and to know your history and to know how you got here, "and pass that along to the people in front of you." - Nowhere else on the planet do we have the chance to really come together and express our sexual liberation in such an open and diverse way. But at the end of the day these are adults engaging in consensual behavior. And that's really what it's all about. It's about making sure that folks have the resources and education that they need, but also, making their own decisions as adults at the end of the day. - All right love. - [Voiceover] Happy Folsom! - Happy Folsom! - Give us a kiss! - Okay. - [Voiceover] We're British. - We're British. He pretends he's British, I'm actually British. - [Voiceover] So what do you think of Folsom Street Fair? - I think it's a little bit sorted. But I like it. - In the best way (laughs). - Yeah, that'd be my boobs. ("Folsom Street Fair Song" by MC Mo'Pussy & Mike Greenburg)
