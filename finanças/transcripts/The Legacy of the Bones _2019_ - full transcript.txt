NAVARRE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1611 FOLLOWING DOZENS OF ACCUSATIONS AND CONFESSIONS OF WITCHCRAFT, THE INQUISITOR ALONSO DE SALAZAR Y FRÍAS WAS SENT TO NAVARRE TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ABOUT THE OBSCURE EVENTS TAKING PLACE THERE. AFTER MONTHS OF INVESTIGATION, THE PRIEST CONFIRMED THAT THE LOCALS WOULD DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT BELIEFS THAT WERE AS ANCIENT AS THEY WERE SINISTER. Push! Push! Push! It's a girl. Don't you take her away! Stop. PAMPLONA COURT PRESENT TIME Boss. Apparently, Medina asked to go to the bathroom. Go with the officers guarding him and stick with them. Take it easy. Boss. Someone knew he'd come here. Boss, the pocket. INSPECTOR SALAZAR Take it easy. Take it easy. Easy... Breathe, Amaia. Come on. You're doing so well. Rest. Rest now and breathe deeply. THE LEGACY OF THE BONES FOUR MONTHS LATER It's the second time they've desecrated that church. A few weeks ago they broke things and threw bones on the floor. Last night, they left a baby skeleton's arm on the altar. Do we know why the Chief is so interested in the church in Arizkun? That's exactly what I'm wondering. Inspector. I'm glad you're back, Salazar. We've missed you. - Thank you. - Inspector. Monsignor Landero is expecting you. As you know, the attack last night on St. John's Church in Arizkun is the second one in recent weeks. This time they didn't break anything, but they left bones on the altar again. Desecration and vandalism against the church are very common, if the media doesn't cover it, it's... Salazar. Let him explain. We know that desecrations aren't that unusual, Inspector, but in this case, there is an element of hatred towards the church based on misunderstood historic concepts. The fact that they used human bones leaves us in no doubt as to the complex nature of this case. The Inspector and her team will deal with this with the utmost discretion. I'm sure they will. Dr. Sarasola is a Vatican attaché for the defense of the faith and a very influential Opus Dei prelate in Rome. He asked expressly for you to take charge of the investigation. Dr. Sarasola? Is he a doctor? He's a very prestigious psychiatrist. We have no option but to take it on and solve it as soon as possible. If you think it's just vandalism, great. Prove it and that will be that. Of course. It's likely that these desecrations are related to the segregation the Cagots were subjected to. They were persecuted centuries ago in Baztán. The symbols in the church refer to that segregation. The door through which they had to enter, the pews at the back which they had to use, the baptistery they couldn't use, also the fact that the desecrators left a Mairu-beso on the altar, a witchcraft practise associated with them. A Mairu-beso, the arm from the skeleton of an unbaptized newborn, a miscarriage or a fetus. Supposedly with magical properties, which protected the houses of families who had lost babies. Damn! First the Basajaun and now witches. What next? The Christmas Olentzero? - Fermín! - Goñi, turn on the light, please. See if any new parishioners have joined here recently. Speak to the catechists and check on anti-Catholic websites and forums. I've left a patrol car there. In a few days, we'll have the DNA results from the bones. Tomorrow I'll go to Elizondo to head the investigation from there. Perfect. That's all. - Coming for a beer, boss? - We have to celebrate your return. Sure, and the birth of your little miss inspector. It's a boy. I know I said a girl, but it turned out to be a boy. Coming? I can't, I have a feed in ten minutes. Thank you. - And what's the baby called? - Ibai. He's called Ibai. We'll drink to you, then. Thank you, have fun. I bet you prefer Mommy giving you dinner, don't you? To you, Inspector! To the boss! And to Ibai! Salazar! PAMPLONA PRISON Salazar! Amaia Salazar! Amaia Salazar! Salazar! Amaia Salazar! Amaia Salazar! Open number 53. - Salazar! - What the hell's going on? I have to see Inspector Salazar! Amaia Salazar. I don't know or care who she is, but she wouldn't waste her time. So, please, shut up. Give her this. Give it to her! And tell her I'm glad she's back. Good morning, Your Honor. - Congratulations on the Basajaun case. - Thank you. And on becoming a mom. I'm delighted we can count on your services again. Your talent is greatly appreciated by everyone. Thank you, Your Honor. Call me Javier, please. - If you could fill me in... - Yes. A prisoner who was serving time for his wife's murder waited until I came back to tell us where he'd buried the body. Boss! The ground there looks like it's been dug up! Looks like they buried something. Her right arm has been severed at the elbow. It looks like a straight cut. Photograph it. INSPECTOR SALAZAR Open gallery three! Open gallery three! Open the door! Open number 53! Three months ago, Jason Medina killed himself at court, leaving a note for me that read, 'Tarttalo'. Now another prisoner, seemingly unrelated, - took his life and left the same note. - Fuck... Both murderers' victims had their arms cut off. Johana's arm turned up in the Arri Zahar cave along with a pile of unidentified bones. Forgive me if I'm not fully up to date, what does 'Tarttalo' means? Yes. It's the name of a bloodthirsty cyclops who devoured Christians. Well I never. Dr. San Martín says you can come in, Inspector. Thank you. Call Lieutenant Padua, see if any other prisoner wrote 'Tarttalo' before killing himself. All right. This way. In recent months, it's been very cold and the body is in pretty good shape. Were all those blows inflicted by her husband? Yes. Is he here? I have both autopsies scheduled for today. They shouldn't be here together. What interests us most is the severing of the arm. Right, Amaia? Yes. I need you to compare the cuts on both arms to determine if this was done by the same person. At first glance, the cuts seem to have been made by the same instrument. One second. Give me a dish, please. I thought it was a piece of bone, but I think... it's a tooth from the saw used to sever the arm. If we repeat the tooth pattern, we can verify if the same tool was used in both cases. All right. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Hello, my darling. Your mommy's here. Come here. Hello. - Inspector Salazar? - Yes? The judge said he's running late and he'll meet you at Rodero's. Thank you. - Good evening. - Your Honor, I'm sorry to bother you. Call me Javier, please. It's best if we speak once you're done. I'll wait outside. Please don't feel uncomfortable. We're two professionals at a meeting, but it shouldn't stop us from enjoying a nice meal. Sit down, eat something and tell me about the case. Yes. - Abalone soup with shellfish and algae. - Thank you. - Who is having wine? - Miss Salazar. Mrs. I'll have water, thank you. Water for Mrs Salazar, then, and the wine for me. Thank you. There are signs that the cases of Lucía Aguirre and Johana Márquez could be connected. And also, but this is just a hunch of mine, I think if we keep digging, we'll find more victims. - Eat. - Yes. Do you think the two women knew each other? I think there's one person behind both crimes, but to find out, I need your authorization. You'll have it, Amaia. But you can't make too much fuss. These cases are closed and we can't put the families through more suffering or let this get into the papers. Of course, you can count on that. I'm working on another case, so I don't think I'll have any news, but I'll keep you posted. Please... Could you cancel the rest of my order? I have to go. - Of course. - I'm so sorry, Your Honor. - Good night. - Good night. - Auntie. - My princess! What's that cradle? Ask your aunt. I've been using it for years to store firewood, but when James heard it was yours, he went crazy. It's perfect. I'm going to fix some dinner. Leave what you don't want. - They're delicious. - Thank you. - Does the house have a chimney? - Yes, it does. - What house? - Juanitaenea, your grandmother's house. What's up? James? I thought it would be nice if we had our own house in the town and your aunt told me about Juanitaenea. Now, hold on. Let's not exaggerate. I just said that if you're going to look at houses, why not start with your nana's? It would be great for the kid and we'd be very close. Auntie... See? There's your confirmation. Of course, sweetie. - Yes, Jonan. - We're in Logroño with a prison officer who remembers the case of a suicide in a cell. I'll put him on. Glad to help you, Inspector. The prisoner had killed his wife in a very nasty way, with a hammer, but then he took the trouble to cut off one of her arms with great care as if he were a surgeon. The man hung himself in his cell, but before he did, he wrote 'Tarttalo' on the wall with his own shit. Sounds familiar? Where was the woman from? Where was she born? The wife was born in Berroeta. Look for victims of a violent death who were dismembered and check their place of origin. Both previous victims were from Baztán. We have to see if it's just a coincidence or if there's some pattern. All right. Sales are better than ever. - That's good. - We have a lot of orders from France. The fact is, Flora's books and her TV show are helping to put us on the map. Flora doesn't interfere? She tries, of course. But since she went to live in Zarautz, she's been very busy. And by the way... Do you watch it? No. They repeat them all the time on the international channel, so I suppose the royalties keep her quiet. Don't put it on. The day got off to such a good start, why ruin it? Okay. Morning. - Auntie. - Amaia. Where's the furniture? The day after your grandmother's will was read, your mother brought a moving van. She emptied the house. I bet she made a good bit of money, all the furniture was handmade. What's wrong? What about this cradle? I don't know. This place is incredible! Do you like Grandma's house, Ibai? Would you like to live here when we come to Elizondo? I'm officially handing you the key to your new home. There, paperwork's done. That's it? That's how we do things here. A handshake and that's that. Well, paperwork done. - Let's go eat. - Come on. Who looks after the vegetable garden? Esteban. He's been doing it for 20 years. Why? He ignored me earlier. Don't worry about it. Poor man. Years ago, his wife killed herself and he's been depressed and lonely ever since. And his son never comes to see him. I'm sure he's scared that if you come here, he might lose his job. His life is the vegetable garden. Don't worry, Auntie. I'll fix that. Don't worry. We're counting on you for the "vegetation" garden! Good night. Switch off the lights, please. I think someone forces them to kill and then makes them kill themselves after signing his name. And the arms are his trophies. Like in the legend of the Tarttalo. Right. We have to study how all the arms that were here were severed. We've found two new cases of women murdered by their husbands who then killed themselves. But we still have to find out if they left anything in writing. See if the victims were from Baztán and if they were dismembered. If so, get their DNA samples to compare with the bones here. Okay. I think this is a botched job. Hello. What a beautiful baby, Amaia. You're spoiling him. Now your niece is here to stop us, Engrasi. Let us enjoy him a bit longer. I couldn't do anything. They're armed with knitting needles. Are you complaining? Look. Lovely. Didn't the cards tell you it was going to be a girl? Well, obviously, it's what it was meant to be. What a nice guy. I love it. Like that. Good night, Auntie. Sleep well. Is anything wrong? Recently, when I hold the cards I've felt energy flowing towards you. An energy that was present before you were born. Experiences with death mark a person forever. You've touched it very closely. That gave you a rare strength, but it made other darker energies want to come for you. - What energies? - Powers... that slept for centuries in the depths of the valley, and that follow you now. Some are there to help you, but others to hurt and confuse you. Amaia... You must be very careful. I'm a policewoman, Auntie. Fighting evil is part of my job. Evil is one thing and curses are another. The ones that can go after you, you feed them by talking to that friend of yours. Auntie... I don't care if you think he's helping you. You know it's unnatural. Did the cards tell you anything else? Yes. What? That you need to sleep more. - Good night. - Good night, dear. Flora? What's wrong? The incident occurred at around 9,00pm. When an orderly was helping her get into bed, Rosario took a sharp object from under her pillow and stuck it into the man's lower belly and groin causing hemorrhaging. A sharp object? Yes, we still have to find out how she got it and where she hid it. Where is she now? Your mother has been immobilized, sedated and moved to a secure area. The orderly barely had time to press the call button on his bracelet and in the time it took his colleagues to arrive, she used his blood to write... that. Good morning, Salazar. Inspector Clemos is in charge of the investigation. Could you lift the bed for a moment? Let me remind you that I'm in charge. Look. Could you move the bed, please? Don't touch anything, please. It's impossible that Rosario wasn't taking her meds. With Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and no meds, you can't control rage. You can't fake being normal. Get photos and gather up all the pills. Could you show me the weapon she used? Of course. Follow me. Show it to her. A scalpel... Someone got a scalpel to Rosario? That's impossible. We have maximum security, your brothers can corroborate that. What do you mean, "my brothers"? She authorized visits for her daughters, her son-in-law and her son Javier. In fact your brother was here with her yesterday. Where's the security room? Fast forward it. Stop. Zoom in. How could you allow a stranger to come into your center that often under a false ID? - Rosario authorized your brother... - We don't have a brother! This place is a disgrace. Our mother can't spend another minute here. - But where should we take her? - To the University Clinic. It's expensive, yes. But Father Sarasola said that if we took her there, they would pay for the stay and for a new treatment. Sarasola contacted you? I think it's a good idea. He said he'd take care of everything? It's decided. Mom has to get out of this dump now. Thank you. Inspector Salazar, it's a pleasure to see you again. Never mind that. Why bring my mother here? To remove her from her path and prevent her from carrying out her mission. What are you talking about? Your mother's case has interested us for some time due to an aspect that sets it apart from other cases of mental disorder. What aspect? Evil. Elaborate. Have a seat, please. For centuries, the church has investigated the origin of evil, examining cases of pitiless, cruel people who enjoy causing pain. I'm not talking about the influence of upbringing, mental illnesses, drugs or keeping bad company... That really only creates the breeding ground. I'm talking about the very essence of evil. Man is free to decide, but there is a frontier, a limit, a moment when only some are capable of taking another step. I'm talking about aberrant behavior. The man who arrives home and strangles his wife while she sleeps, fills the bathtub and drowns his two-year old twins as they struggle, then takes the baby and submerges it next to the bodies of its siblings, makes supper, turns on the TV and falls asleep on the couch. That moment of abandonment. That is the object of our study and my interest in your mother. A century ago, everyone knew the seven deadly sins by heart. Today, it's hard to find a few people who remember them. We've moved away from God and from the church. Modern psychiatry, Freud, all that nonsense, persuaded people that all evils lie in not having received maternal love in childhood. And the result is that we have become a confused society that calls any aberration madness because it's incapable of distinguishing what it is. Do you think that evil is what unhinged Rosario? She got mixed up in something she shouldn't have and that always comes at a price. She probably still feels she hasn't finished her work. That's why she didn't take her life when she had the chance, because there's still something she has to do. What do you suggest? A treatment for her mental illness, but also for her soul. Inclusive therapy carried out by a team of the world's leading experts. I don't want anyone to visit her. Not even my sisters. That's our protocol and, given the circumstances, it's for the best. Your Honor. I'm very sorry about what happened with your mother. If you want to talk about it, I can go and get you right now. Thank you, but there's no need. My secretary told me that you wanted to speak to me. Yes, I need an order to get access to the bones we found in the cave. I'll process it right now. Thank you. What's Markina doing here? He has to be present so that the results are legally valid. Your Honor. - Your Honor. - Good morning. Let's go. Thank you for seeing us so quickly, Dr. Takchenko. It's a pleasure to see you again and "to be of use". Doctor González. Here we are. - A pleasure to see you again. - You too. Your Honor. Inspector. - Do you have the samples? - Here they are. It will take us several hours to process the DNA of the bones and compare it with that from the hair, skin and saliva of the victims' relatives. It's incredible that in a place like this, you're so advanced technically. Well, what's incredible is that the police aren't, Deputy Inspector. Indeed. Let us know when you're hungry or if you need anything. - Thank you. - Make yourselves at home. Thank you. How did you find this place? The doctors helped me a while ago to solve a tough case. - They're a couple, aren't they? - Yes. How do you know? I saw how they looked at each other and I felt they were close. One of those couples that you can see are a team. How about we go over what's brought us here? Of course. The fact that Rosario wrote 'Tarttalo' links her to the accomplice behind the other cases. Who seems to have known her for some time. Since she was admitted, she's only had contact with medical staff, inmates, your sisters and Víctor. Tell Goñi to make a list of all the staff at the hospitals where Rosario has been. The choice of the bone cave shows that the perp knows the area. We have to find out why all the victims are women from Baztán. That can help us draw up a behavior pattern. Maybe he met them somehow. The idea of a great instigator... It's hard to believe that such fidelity to someone is possible. People who experience trauma are more likely to fall for this. The foundations of their personality are altered making them more impressionable. It's likely that all those manipulated suicides had a traumatic past. That's very interesting. Very well noted, Etxaide. Montes... Boss, we're with the Poor Clares in Arizkun who say that there's a new young parishioner who's been coming to the church. He always sits at the back and never takes communion. His name is Beñat Zaldúa and he has a blog in which he always talks about the injustices against the Cagots over the centuries. Good job. Find him and tell him to come in for questioning. Okay. Congratulations. Your suspicions about the Cagots were right. THE CAGOTS: THE DAMNED PEOPLE Behind these crimes, there's a face and a name, but sometimes I think that this valley is cursed. It's a beautiful, powerful place, but it's also been full of horror and evil for centuries. Did you know that in 1611, the inquisitor Alonso de Salazar y Frías traveled the Baztán valley to find out if there was anything demonic here? The inquisitor's surname was Salazar? He got over 1,000 people to confess to practising witchcraft and about 3,000 statements accusing neighbors of evil practises. "The witches' lawyer". That's what they called him. Salazar created a method for obtaining reliable statements based on empirical facts. It says here that he tried to discredit the 'Malleus Maleficarum', the manual of witchcraft followed by the Holy Office. Amaia, it's all right. It's Mom! Hurry! Don't let her see you in my bed. Little bitch. Little bitch. Little bitch. Amaia! Don't let Mom eat him like she did with me, please. Don't let her eat him! Amaia... Amaia, wake up. Amaia... Don't let her eat him! Inspector. Yes? There's a match in the samples. We'll have to redo it through official channels, but, more importantly, I'm going to reopen the case. - Good. - Congratulations. Thank you. The match proves that some bones in the cave belong to two of the victims in which Tarttalo's signature appeared. Doctor San Martín. Come in. - Doctor. - Inspector. There's something we wanted to talk to you about. We were waiting for the study on the bones in the Arizkun church. I did the analyses myself and I repeated them several times, so there's no doubt about it. What is it? The DNA from the baby's arm that was left in the church is a 100% match with yours. That's impossible. I was never in contact with the sample. I'm not talking about transferred DNA. I'm talking about the very essence of the bones. Did you have a twin sister? No. Until 1979, it wasn't compulsory to register the death of a newborn. Maybe it was so painful for your parents that they never mentioned it. The bones from the first desecration have a 25% match with yours, so they also belonged to someone from your family. We're going to open an investigation, so we need you to tell us which cemetery your family members are buried in. Sure. Why can't we interrogate him? Because it's faster than having to read a report in your fucking handwriting. We spend all day running errands, making lists, calls... - Shall we go? - Yes, sure, boss. Bingo. Amaia Salazar, Homicide... It's outrageous that you've made us wait an hour... Look, sir, your son is the prime suspect. Your son is the prime suspect in a very serious crime so waiting here for an hour is the least of your problems. You can keep quiet or call a lawyer, but don't interrupt me again. Understood? - Beñat Zaldúa, is that right? - Yes. Look, Beñat, even though you're still a minor, you can still be held liable. I want to help you, and I promise that I'll speak to the judge so that he's understanding with your case. But for that, I need you to be honest with me. If you lie to me or hide anything, I'll leave you to your fate, and it's not looking good. A man wrote on my blog. He liked what I was writing and we became friends. We chatted and one day he said, "Why not attack the church?" But he didn't say anything about baby bones, I swear. Don't worry. Do you remember his name? He told me to call him Cagot, a very typical Cagot name. We chatted a lot, but I only saw him the two nights we prepared everything, and then when we went to the church. How old is he? What does he look like? I don't know, dark... He looks like him. Bald, but younger. For fuck's sake... And he's missing three fingers on his left hand. That's a bit creepy, to be honest. Thank you, Beñat. We'll tell the judge you collaborated. You can go now. What are those marks on your neck, Beñat? - Did your father hit you? - No... - What the hell do you mean? - Sit down. Don't worry. Leave. We're going to keep a close eye on you. If you lay a hand on him again, you'll deal with the consequences. SALAZAR AMPUTEE NO RESULTS FOUND SALAZAR AMPUTEE NO RESULTS FOUND Your mother has always been a secretive woman, but hiding a child seems a little much, especially with the gossips in this town. I've dreamed about her for years. I thought it was me, but I now I know it's my sister. That's why in Juanitaenea there was a cradle just like mine. They were expecting two baby girls. Her death certificate isn't in any database. What if she's alive and doesn't know we exist? Do you remember where I was born? Yes, in your parents' house. And who was at the birth? I can't say for certain because I wasn't living here then, but I suppose it was Manuel Hidalgo. He was the town doctor. Where have you been? You shouldn't go out alone at night when you're pregnant. Something could happen to you or the boy. And who said it won't be a girl? Fina Hidalgo? Inspector Salazar. It's a pleasure. When my late brother closed his practice in Elizondo, he brought home everything we had there. And to be honest, I've never felt the need to touch it. - You said 1980, right? - Yes. The patient is called Rosario Iturzaeta. Excuse the mess. I don't need the full medical record, just information about the births. I'm saying that in case you need a court order. Don't worry about that. As you're from the police... Here it is. Rosario Iturzaeta. Have a seat, please. Let's see... Natural birth in 1973 of a healthy girl called Flora. Natural birth in 1975 of a healthy girl called Rosaura. And natural birth in 1980 of two healthy twin girls whose names don't appear. If one had been amputated, would it be here? No, that would have been done in a hospital. We only did minor treatments in the practice. And if one of the babies had died soon after birth? Then it would appear on the death certificate. My brother signed them all at that time. Wait a minute. Here it is. We're in luck. Newly born daughter of Juan Salazar and Rosario Iturzaeta. Cause of death: Cot death. That's what they used to call sudden infant death syndrome. The child must have been born unwell. Born unwell? Do you mean she was sick? Well, maybe not sick exactly... They may have detected some defect or disability after she was born. But that's not a cause of death. - So, you're one of those? - One of who? Those clueless people who make a fuss, but are in favor of abortion if the fetus isn't right. A newborn baby isn't a fetus. - Oh, no? - No. Who says so? You? I'm a nurse. I've seen many abortions and there's not that much difference. There is! First, a newborn child is independent of its mother. Besides, it's the law. The law's a joke! Tell that to a poor family with kids who has a retarded newborn. Did you and your brother kill newborn babies with problems? Not my brother. He was a moralist and a Holy Joe like you. In most cases, it was the families who did it. I only helped when they didn't have the courage, although they'd probably deny it now. If I may. Officially, they're cot deaths. The statute of limitations on those offenses has expired. Offenses? They're murders! Come on! Aren't you supposed to be objective? Think about it logically, for God's sake. I'm taking this certificate. All right. I love collaborating with the police. The Salazar Iturzaeta vault. With all the rain recently I need to make sure there are no leaks. I told you there aren't, but all yours. - Thank you. - Everything okay? Yes, thanks. Like I told you, stone lies on stone and with the passing of time it becomes waterproof. He's the image of you. I see him smile and it's like seeing you. Right, Ibaitxu? Girls, what do you two remember from when Amaia was born? I remember that... at the beginning we looked after you a lot. Mom was very delicate with her nerves, and we had to take turns giving you the bottle. It's true that Mom didn't look well. - She was a bit stressed. - Why was she stressed? The house, the bakery, two daughters... - And a baby who wouldn't stop crying. - Did I cry a lot? All the time. You spent all of the first year bawling. Did I? A friend of Mom's used to come and look after us, but when you were born they weren't speaking anymore, so Ros and I had to cope with all your tantrums. What friend? Elena Ochoa. From the house next to the bakery. Oh yes, Elena. You were a beautiful baby, I remember that perfectly. Yes, Jonan. Nuria Otaño is his ex-wife, she's the one who shot him. Why did you say this had to do with the case? Because the man is missing three fingers on one hand. Ana Otaño is her sister. Inspector Salazar, Homicide Department, Navarre Police. My sister gets scared and she's a little nervous. What happened? Her husband took her to Murcia a long time ago. He cut her off from everyone and chained her to a wall. Two years ago she managed to escape. She reported him and Antonio was put in prison. But he got out on leave a few days ago. He rang her and said he was coming after her. Nuria got really scared so I bought her a shotgun, a few boxes of cartridges and taught her to shoot. That's what families are for. - And today Antonio came to take her. - Yes, he did. And you... How can you let a man like that on the streets again? Wait here, please. - Hello. - He said he'd take me to the hospital. "Over my dead body, you son of a bitch," I told him. As soon as he came into the room I shot at him and blew off his ear. I should have hit him in the face, but my hands were shaking and I couldn't aim well. Do you know what he did? Do you want me to tell you? He shat himself! The coward shat himself with fear while he was running away. - You say his name is Antonio Garrido? - Yes. His accomplice in the desecrations is a teenager Garrido manipulated. The boy identified him and is collaborating, so I'd ask you not to bring charges against him. Very kind of you, Inspector. There's something I've been wondering since we talked about Rosario. What is it? You said you'd known about her case for a long time, but I know you never treated her. How did you know about her? At psychiatric conferences participants present interesting cases to other professionals to try to make progress. At one of them, Dr. Basterra mentioned Rosario's case, always anonymously, of course, and someone mentioned it to me. Sharing cases is fundamental in our work, Inspector. And very often it means improvements for the patients. Want to see her? - What? - Do you want to see your mother? - She's very calm and she looks well. - No. Thank you, but no. She won't see you. She's in observation behind a mirror like the ones in police stations. That way you get an idea about her state and stop making suppositions. We'll be outside if you need anything. Inspector. Let's go. What's wrong? Boss! - How did it go? - You're sick! You knew that she'd react! She reacted? How could I have known? Calm down, please, and tell me what happened. - It's important. - I have nothing to say. There's the medical team treating your mother. Dr. Berasategui is the person attending to your mother. Please, stop following me. Boss! It was a mistake to move her here. Do you want me to drive? I can't stand Sarasola. He's arrogant, overbearing. And do you know what really fucks me up? He's right about my mother. Give me the keys, come on. Don't be so stubborn. Well, in your case I should say, “Don't be even more stubborn”. Yes? Hello. Elena? Aren't you Rosario's youngest? Amaia, yes. Can we speak for a moment? Come in. Thank you. By the time you were born, your mother and I had grown apart. I loved her very much and it hurt me to end our friendship like that, - but she left me no choice. - Thank you. What happened? We, your mother and I, had joined a body expression group, we did yoga, meditation... We always met in a farmhouse with a master. He was attractive, handsome, well dressed, with a deep voice... A very special man. We talked about astral trips, UFOs and esoteric things, but gradually it all started to focus on magic, above all on the witchcraft in the valley. I enjoyed that less, but your mother was fascinated. One day the master made us join another group from Lesaka he had been working with for a while, and of which he was very proud. With them we started doing sacrifices. Cats, roosters, pigeons... You killed animals? We did it in different ways and always collected the blood in bottles. For them blood was absurdly important. - My mother was part of that? - Yes. One day the master told us that an animal was “just a sacrifice”, but that “the great sacrifice” had to be made the way the witches did it in ancient times. I got so scared and I spoke to your mother about leaving. But she didn't want to listen, called me a traitor. I stopped going and your mother stopped talking to me. Over the next months I got threats: drops of blood in letters, the nails and hair of animals... One day, my daughter, who was very young, arrived home with a load of walnuts that a woman had given her in the street. What you're telling me is very important, I need a list of the people who took part in it. No, I'll never do that. I wouldn't put my family in danger. Do they still meet? Didn't you hear me? If I say any more they'll kill me. Did you find anything out? No. I looked in the records of people with prosthetics in case she was abducted. But not a trace. Auntie. Can the dead do anything? The dead do what they can... Amaia. James. The itxusuria! What's that? Long ago, children who died without being baptised were buried in the itxusuria, a family cemetery made under the roof of the house, against the wall. What about the bones? Nothing. We covered them with some planks and left them there. Amaia, I know you... Don't even think of going to see it now. They're twin girls. Twice the luck... Congratulations, Juan. It went great. They're twin girls. Twice the luck... Thank you. What was that? Probably nothing, don't worry. - Don't worry, I'm staying. - All right. Call me if you need anything. Fina will be staying with them. I'm sure your wife is looking after the babies. Rosario? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing, Rosario? Get out! Get out! Get out of here! Have you gone mad? What are you doing? What are...? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? What have you done? The scalpel Rosario used belongs to the same surgical set as the saw tooth we found. Which proves the Tarttalo visited Rosario. She must have told him where to find my sister's bones. That links him with the desecrations. Do you think the Tarttalo could be my mother? I don't think so. Bones were left in the cave when she was hospitalized. And the man with no fingers? No. He was in prison and couldn't have severed the arm. Johana's case doesn't fit in with the others. She lived in the valley. Her murderer killed her impulsively, then improvised the crime scene. So how could the Tarttalo appear at that very moment to take his trophy? Maybe he was watching Jason, but still didn't control him fully. Or perhaps he was watching Johana, not her killer. There was something special about his relationship with her. Something doesn't fit. Good morning. The firefighters say it'll take them another hour to open the road again. We'll come back later for the car. Be careful in the town! The river's bound to overflow, we had to cordon off houses and the old abandoned hospital. Thank you. Nuria Otaño told me that before she shot her husband - he said he'd take her to the hospital. - What are you getting at? Not “Send you to the hospital”, he said “Take you to the hospital”. It's just a hunch, but the officer mentioned an abandoned hospital. The old pilgrim hospital. - Shouldn't we go and take a look? - Let's go. Look. That's the hospital! - There's someone there! - You're right. Let's go! Go ahead. - Police, halt! - Halt! Police! Freeze! Police! Stop! Halt! Halt! Stop! Don't move! Put your hands up! Kneel down! Now! Go the other side, Jonan! Don't move! - You got him? - I got him. Don't move. Easy. Don't move. Don't move. Easy... No! Fuck! Here you are. I don't think I can have any more caffeine. That's why I got you hot chocolate. Thanks. Boss, Goñi found the set that the scalpel and the saw belonged to. Inspectors. Doctor. They're finishing sewing him up. He has multiple fractures, concussion, three depressed discs... He'll live, but I don't know when he'll be able to make a statement. It's vital we speak to him. Give us a call when he wakes up. Of course. No matter what time. - Don't worry, Inspector. - Thank you. Inspector! Thank you. Let me know when the phone appears, whatever the time. You've got it, boss. Good evening, Your Honor. If it keeps raining like this, tomorrow the town will be flooded. Thank you for coming out here. Thank you. We'll say I went to the hospital because the baby was coughing. When they see that one, we'll say she's fine now and that's that. Let us know when they're there. The technicians are going to your family's to collect the bones. Montes says they found a phone close to where Garrido threw his. - Is it his? - Looks like it. They still have to check. I don't know, it's likely that the current... He got a call? But he was under guard! I don't know how it could have happened. Salazar of the Navarre Police. Who's in charge? I'm the supervisor. How is it possible that a patient under guard received a call? He was sedated, so the phone in his room wasn't disconnected. What is it? Garrido got that phone number a few days ago. He only made about twenty calls. One was to his sister-in-law's house, the rest were to the Psychiatric Department at the University Clinic. He called the Psychiatric Department? Yes. Check if the other killers had therapy in prison or before they went in. Check their records, call the families. - All right. - Got it. Boss, I have the location of the call he received. Hotel Reino de Navarra. That's next to the clinic. I've spoken to the prisons where the suspects were, and they all received therapy in prison. It's organized by the University Clinic. Does the name of any doctor appear on the reports? They all seem to be signed by a... Dr. Sarasola. Excuse me. Excuse me! He's not in. If you want to talk to Fr. Sarasola you ask for an appointment. Take us to him. Without evidence I can't give you a warrant to lock up Sarasola. Just questioning. He's responsible for brainwashing therapies. That'll be hard to prove. And also it means a conflict with the Holy See and with a very prestigious Opus Dei clinic. I'm sorry, you not having balls to issue a warrant won't stop me doing my job. Why did you ask for me to investigate the desecrations? I don't think this is the place... And why did you suddenly appear and take my mother? I'll see you later. I chose you because of your talent and sensitivity. At least two patients you treated in prison murdered and committed suicide, leaving the same signature. I've never visited anyone in any prison. I sign a lot of documents, that's all. Garrido's phone is full of calls to this clinic, and someone who spoke to him so that he'd take his life called from a phone less than 100 yards from here. Where were you two hours ago? At the archbishopric after receiving a prelate from Rome. Where's Rosario? I want to talk to her. That's impossible. Rosario is receiving treatment in which isolation is crucial. You didn't care about that before. Take me to her now. You'll sign a disclaimer, the clinic will decline any responsibility. I want to see Rosario now! Are you sure you want to see her? Open the door, please. After you. Where is she? Nurse! Why is Rosario Iturzaeta not in her room? They moved her over an hour ago for the CAT scan. I didn't order any CAT scan. Dr. Berasategui ordered it. This is completely irregular. Find Dr. Berasategui. He's to call me immediately. Doctor Berasategui to the nurses' station on the 12th floor. Who is that doctor? He's a psychiatrist I trust. He presented your mother's case to me after he heard about her. He's been treating her since she was admitted. I tried to introduce him to you the other day, remember? Doctor Berasategui to the nurses' station on the 12th floor. I believe Dr. Berasategui had a CAT scan programmed for the patient Rosario Iturzaeta. It says that he cancelled the scan two hours ago. Security? This is Fr. Sarasola. Locate Dr. Berasategui urgently and a psychiatric patient called Rosario Iturzaeta. She's very dangerous. - I imagine your clinic has cameras. - Yes. He's my mother's visitor. - Where does that exit lead to? - The parking lot. Miguel, can you hear me? An orderly has been stabbed in the store room. I repeat, we just found an orderly and I think he's dead. I'm on my way. I want a photo of the doctor, his phone number, home address, car license and model and all the documentation you have. Come with me. We have files on everyone working at the clinic. Etxaide here. We have to issue an urgent arrest warrant. Doctor Berasategui. Urgent! Were the sessions between the doctor and Rosario filmed? Yes. I want to see them. Those sessions are private. Father, I can get a court order right away, I'm sure your clinic is not interested in the fuss that will cause. So stop behaving like a suspect and collaborate. Go! Go! Clear! Clear. Clear. Clear. How are you feeling, Rosario? Very well, thank you. Can I have visits, doctor? They're not advisable in this first stage of the treatment, but I promise that we'll consider it later on, okay? Whatever you say. Do you miss anyone? My daughter Flora, my son-in-law Víctor... They always used to come and see me. It says you have two other daughters, Rosaura and Amaia. Amaia only came once to see her mother. - Just once. - And why do think that is? She must have her reasons. What the hell is this? The doorman says he hasn't been seen much recently. Inspector... And what about you? Have you been to Elizondo to see your father? If you agree, I'd like to talk about your family. Get the field team and call the judge. We have to process all this as soon as possible. And what about you? Have you been to Elizondo to see your father? He used to come to the workshop to see Jason. I was always surprised that such an elegant man would come all the way here to talk with a mechanic. But when I asked Jason he said it was none of my business. Thank you, Inés. Auntie. If you're calling to ask about Ibai he's sleeping like a log in the middle of the storm. The electricity is off everywhere. Thanks, but I need something else. The gardener whose son never goes to see him, do you know his name, or the father's surname? Esteban Yáñez, I don't know about the son. They sent him to a boarding school when his mother died, and then I heard that he never comes to see him. And the mother? What was her name? The mother was Margarita, Margarita Berasategui. This has been handled more. It looks like it's been defrosted several times to open it. I'd say that those are teeth marks. If you agree, I'd like to talk about your family. My daughter Flora told me something about Amaia that delighted me. Oh, really? What did she tell you? That the man she sleeps with had got her pregnant. That's good news. It's going to be a girl. Another girl in the family, doctor, can you imagine? All I can think about is meeting her. And what are you going to do when you meet her? I'll eat that little bitch. She's going to kill Ibai. - Ros! - Amaia. Listen to me, Ros! Listen carefully! Run to auntie's house. - Mom has escaped, she's after Ibai! - What? She's going to kill Ibai! Run! What are you saying? I'm on my way. Juantxo! - OK. - Juantxo! Don't hang up, stay with me! But run! Don't worry. Juantxo! Juantxo! Let's go! Don't worry, we're on our way! - Fuck! - Come on! Come on! Are you all right? Come on! Attention! Units 5 and 7 approaching the inspector's home. It's open. Don't worry, I'm sure they're fine. Let's go! Yes. Come on! Auntie! Auntie! Auntie! Police! Put your hands up! I'm Rosaura, Amaia's sister! Take it easy. Wait here until I tell you. Oh, Jesus! Jesus! Amaia... She's taken him. She's taken Ibai. Stop the car... Stop. No! No! No! No! Amaia... Amaia! Breathe. Listen, breathe. My baby! My baby! We'll find him. We'll find him, Amaia. Montes! We've informed the Civil Guard, the Basque police, the gendarmes... We've closed the road! In this weather they must be hiding somewhere. His father is Esteban Yáñez and he's from Elizondo. Check his house, the Juanitaenea farmhouse. - Of course. - Please! Iriarte! Go to the Juanitaenea farmhouse with a patrol. We're on our way to Elizondo, they're probably there. Let's go get him! Let's go get him! - But where? - Jon! It's here! It's here! Help! Please! Please! Please! Please! This way, Jonan, it's this way! - Jonan! - Keep going and I'll catch up! Go and get Ibai! Run! Go! Oh, my God... please don't abandon me now. Don't abandon me now. No! Freeze! Stay still. Don't move. Drop the knife and stand up. You can't stop it. This is much bigger than us. Shut up! Drop the knife and get away from my son! Son? It's a boy? Don't touch him. Don't touch him. Where's the girl? Flora said that it was a girl! Where's your daughter? Ibai is my son. Why? - Oh, God! - No! It had to be a sacrifice! It had to be a girl, like your sister and like you. Or do you think I'm finished with you? Stand up. Little bitch. I'm not finished with you. Do you think I am? I'm not finished with you. -Not yet. - Don't move, Mom. Don't move. I'm not finished with you. You can never stop it. Inspector! The current must have dragged it out. Amaia. I'll wait for you. Your Honor. With the force of the river last night, if Rosario fell in, at this stage she could be anywhere. After finding the coat and with the storm last night, I've had to cancel the operation, but I've warned all the towns and patrols to be on alert. If you want to talk about it or if you need anything, call me any time. Thank you. I'll be waiting. We're cancelling the operation. We're moving out. Hi. Any word about Mom? Nothing. My love. May I, Auntie? Come in, sweetheart. How are you? Looking far from pretty, what do you expect? And your back? Well, I was thinking of running with the bulls this year. First of all, Inspector Salazar, my client wants to thank you for saving his life. Is that your strategy? To convince us the doctor is a victim? My client acted under threat from a very dangerous mental patient. A patient he visited in a clinic by pretending to be a relative. He was fascinated by Rosario's case and became friends with her. But the judge will see there was no ill will in his visits. Six months, tops. You gave her the scalpel that she used. My client is sure that can't be proved. And what about the suicides of his other patients? The rate of violent people who take their own lives is very high. My client is innocent so I'm sure he has an alibi for each occasion. Dr. Berasategui obtained information about her family's remains via Rosario. Did you like that, Inspector? Where did you get my sister's bones and where is her body? I don't know what you're talking about. Inspector Salazar says it doesn't fit. While going through your collection of souvenirs, we discovered that the piece of Johana Márquez that you kept has been bitten on various occasions, so we'll check if the flesh wounds match your teeth. My client has dental implants. Wait your turn, lawyer. As I was saying, your fascination with Johana, led you to bite and suck her flesh so often that you ended up covering it with saliva and thus your DNA. Something that, Mr. Berasategui, you devious fucking madman, incriminates you directly. Your investigation does not have the power to change fate. Yes, sure. And a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. My client has nothing more to say about your suppositions. I don't care what the others say. I know that Mom isn't dead. She's out there somewhere, and I know she still hasn't finished. And what are you going to do? Find her. THE BAZTÁN TRILOGY
