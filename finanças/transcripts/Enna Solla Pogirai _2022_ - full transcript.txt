Love, there is nobody who would not have fallen in love. Everybody has a love story. And every story has an origin. But it is not necessary that our love story... ...must begin the way we want it and end the way we want it too. Meet Vikram. He's an RJ in a FM station in Chennai. He's in search of his dream girl, a guy... ...who is in search of his love and dream girl with a checklist. As the darkness fills up the night, let love fill up all your hearts. This is Theera Ula and I am your very own RJ Vikram. Thanks for tuning in. Stay tuned. Come on, what's all this? Thank you. Only I know the pain to run the show. I just wanted it to end. She was bugging me so bad. -Congrats. As usual. Thanks, Maya. Great show. -See you. Thank you. -What's the plan after the party? The party just started. We still have time. Excuse me. Cheers to us, for Theera Ula. -She's trying so hard. You mean Maya? She won't suit me. She isn't my kind of girl. -So, what's your type? My type... She must be a little independent. Must be creative. And at the same time, she must be simple. That's my kind of girl. -Does the list stop there? Well, my list keeps updating. Forget it. What's up with you? I had applied to do a Masters degree in London. And I've got it. Good news, right? Then why the long face? I joined here because this experience would help me... ...when I study for Masters. But I'm in love with this job now. I feel like I belong here. I don't feel like quitting this job. I'm confused. -Don't worry and be happy. It's not that simple, Vikram. The toughest decision of my life is this one. Okay. This is what I do when I'm not sure. Let's try it, okay? I'm going to toss this coin. Heads, you choose the job. Tails, Masters. Okay? -Okay. When I tossed the coin, your heart knew what you wanted. Your heart knows what to do. Go for it. Cheers. Cheers, Vikram. -See you. He rejects every bride I choose for him. I've no idea what his plan is. I wonder what reason will he find to reject this bride now. He's my only child, yet the hell I'm going through..... Well, you'll need some broad bean seeds. Powder it and if you consume it for a month,... ...your sugar level will be under control. Yes, it has even doing its rounds on WhatsApp. Which means it's definitely a fact. -All the time on the phone? Well, did you talk to that girl? -Who? My friend's daughter, Anjali. The bride I chose for you. You texted me, "Please talk to Anjali." And you sent me my own number. Who am I to speak to? Meet Anjali, a writer. All the novels she wrote so far were about love. Though she has written so many novels on love,... ...she has never fallen in love. But she believes that she knows everything about love. The event went well, right? Any other plans for today? Hi. Sorry, I'm late. Can you please sign my copy? -Yeah. Of course. My husband and I are your big fans. In fact we first met when we were buying your book. We often quote many lines from your books. Bye. -Thank you. How did you agree for an arranged marriage? Why? What's the big deal? People have fallen in love after reading your novel... ...and I thought you'd also end up having a love marriage. I'll get married and fall in love. Once the groom is finalized,... ...the romance thereafter will also be beautiful. All that sounds good, Anjali. You've never been in love. But why do you expect the groom to have fallen in love before? What's wrong? Only the boy who had been in love will know its value. He'll have the maturity to be in a relationship. That is why. -I see. Well, finding such a guy is no big deal. Guys nowadays would have surely fallen in love and failed. I'm not talking about guys who do not know what true love is. It should be an actual, proper relationship. Darling! -Yes, boss? Cut the snacks to table number four. How did you know I was going to serve them? Snacking is fine, but they are snacking on leftovers too. So, cut it. -She left me, uncle. It's unbelievable. -What is going on here? Boss, his highness is going through a love failure. So he's sad. -Well, Samy,... ...foreigners come to the pub to find love. But our people come to the pub when they break up. He loved the girl deeply and sincerely. But that didn't work out. Hence he's too sad. Fine, sponsor him two large on the house. Take care of him. -Okay. All the four drinks he had were on credit. Who gave you the permission to do so? Come on, boss. -Boss! Listen to his love story and you'll also feel sad for him. Let me hear his tragic love story. The girl he fell in love with is quite shy. Let her be. But he still got to know her, fell in love with her... ...and finally proposed his love to her. Yeah. -Boss, Laila and Majnu,... ...Romeo and Juliet, Jessie and Karthik. The very issue that existed in these love stories... ...existed in his love story too. -What exactly is the issue? That girl is beautiful and very traditional. But she isn't well off. Must have spent all her money at the parlor. No, he helped her fly down all the way from Malaysia. Then in Chennai airport, with a bouquet on one hand... ...and some chocolates on the other hand. With all eyes on the exit terminal, he was anxiously waiting for her. Not here, but in the airport. -Okay. Guess why? The happiness that he was going to see her for the first time. Her name is? -Priya Sweety. Priya Sweety. Priya Sweety wouldn't have come. -Boss. Samy, names like Priya Sweety, Banu Beauty are fake... ...and everyone knows that. And you called this a true love? I can even forgive you for that. But you gave him free drinks and insulted my pub. Go inside! What about this guy? -You please step aside. Sweety! Did you lock horns with Samy again? Ready to see the next bride? She's my dad's friend's daughter. So before meeting her,... ...I found out about her on social media. Social media is where everyone is getting caught. Be careful. Nothing of that sort. If you need to know a girl's likes and dislikes,... ...social media is the right place. And when I checked her profile, I liked her vibe. Liked her vibe? Dude, are you all right? Why? -You'd normally find faults... ...in every girl. What's with this 'I like her vibe'. Her name is Anjali, she's a writer. And she writes only love novels. Late night walks, star gazing, Illayaraja's songs... ...she loves them. -Great. Will she like you? Isn't that why I'm meeting her tomorrow? Congratulations. -Crazy fool! You say you saw her profile on social media. Like Priya Sweety, she may be Anjali Cutie, a bake ID. You can't even say 'fake' properly. So, stop giving social messages. Stop making fun, go and work in the kitchen. Go on! Arrogant fool! -Make sure I can't hear it. He has no ears. -Hey! Does the girl's father own a sweet shop? Look at all these sweets. Uncle, we saw brides in retail earlier. Is it time for a wholesale deal? -Shut up. Buddy, looks like you have many sisters-in-law. Like in the film Roja, if the bride refuses, you can marry her sister. Just for laughs. -Do you think that was funny? Ask your dad to crack a joke, we'll laugh together. I told Vikram everything yesterday. We are fine with it. The remaining formalities... -Dad! I'd like to talk to Vikram in person. The scene's unfolding exactly like Roja. She'll tell you that she loves her uncle. You'll marry her sister and go on a honeymoon to Kashmir. Won't you shut up? When you said you wanted to talk to me in person,... ...I thought you'll take me to some coffee shop. I didn't anticipate the beach. A walk on this beach and the sunrise here,... ...I love them both. There's something about this place. There's beauty in the peace this place has to offer. Vikram, have you ever fallen in love with anyone? Love? Have you fallen in love with anyone? Love..... Usually girls ask questions like... Do you smoke? Do you drink? Who's your favourite hero? In fact, I've been even asked about my salary. But you are different. What I ask is more important than all those details. So, I asked you. Have you ever fallen in love? I'm not talking about school time crushes. Something that was serious. Vikram didn't expect Anjali would ask him something like that. She took him to that peaceful beach... ...and without boasting about her character to him,... ...she asked about him, which was new to Vikram. He liked that very much. Vikram, you seem to be lost in thoughts. Did I ask something wrong? -Not at all. I've been in love. -Really? Yeah. -What's her name? Her name is Aishwarya. Where and how did you meet her first? It was raining heavily that day. Chennai City looks beautiful when it rains in summer. It was drizzling around 11 pm. You appeared like a flash in front of me... You swept me off my feet like a storm... As I stood drenched in the rain... I'm lost in your beauty... When she stood next to me,... ...the tension in the air, the rain and breeze,... ...the strawberry fragrance on her,... ...I could feel that everything around me was so beautiful. Excuse me, hi. I'm unable to open my car door. Can you please help me? As we were leaving,... ...I could feel my heart becoming heavy. If we truly like something, I believe the whole universe... ...would conspire in order for us to achieve it. That day, it really happened to me. I did not understand... I'm looking at you... Is this for real... I keeping asking myself... Can you tell me the route to Adyar please? I'm going there. You can follow me. Wow! Just wow! -Wow? What? Vikram, was that how you guys met for the first time? So, tell me. Do you smoke? Clubbing? Who is your favourite hero? What did Vikram say? I like him, dad. Hi, Vikram. -Hi, Anjali. Good time to talk? -Come on, don't be so formal. Tell me. -Vikram, can you do me a favour? Just go ahead and ask. -Ever read my books? Yet to. -I'm writing my next story. I'm just lost in between. Writer's block. The moment that you described the other day,... ...it sounded magical. It helped me to get back to writing. I believe that every story has two sides to it. Okay. Vikram, Aishwarya is in Chennai, right? Yes, of course, she's in Chennai. Yes, she is in Chennai. Why do you ask? I want to meet Aishwarya. If I meet her,... ...I'll get to know the complete story of your relationship. Also, it will help me to write my book. I get it, Vikram. She's your ex-girlfriend. If you don't wish to meet her,... ...I'll meet her alone. Please do this favour for me. Okay, bye. -Well, Anjali..... Anjali! Dude, why are these girls like this? They ask tricky questions and don't even give us time to respond. What crap? Instead of choosing a bride and getting married,... ...why indulge in such unnecessary things? Anjali believes that if one doesn't fall in love, life will be useless. How can I tell her that I have never been in love? Now, what does she want? She wants to meet Aishwarya. Where will I find Aishwarya? Shall I check with Abhishek Bachchan? What the problem, boss? -Here's the problem. Well, I leave it to you..... -I have an idea. I'll take you to Anjali right away. I'll tell her,... ..."Anjali, you're the best of all the girls I met so far. Hence, he lied about falling in love. Otherwise, he is a nice guy." I'll tell that to her and the problem will be solved. When she realises our relationship started off with a lie,... ...it won't turn out good. -Fine, what do you suggest? Lot of girls visit your pub. -So what? And you have many girlfriends. Yeah, that's true. -Hook me up with someone. Not just one girl, brother,... ...if my boss wants, he can get hundred girls for you. No way! -Please, buddy! Stop playing see-saw with your hands. It won't workout. Hands off! No way! -Please! Please? What business do you think I'm running? You guys are changing my profession. Both are the same. -Buddy, no way. Please, dude. -I said no way. Boss. -Fool! So these are the artistes who turned up for the audition? Buddy, I had to go through hell to arrange this. Make sure you choose someone. What's my role? -Chicken roll. I hope you have a dubbing artiste ready to dub for me. Rose! -Dubbing? Miss Gongura, please leave. -Am I selected? Make up man, hairdresser, costumer and a caravan. I want only a single door caravan. At 10 am, an apple juice. Before lunch, dates and nuts. Evening, lime juice will be good. What's going on, dude? -I guess she works in a juice shop. My baby can dance, fight and also ride a horse. How about romance? Dude, this is torture. -No, she can't do that alone. Samy! -Boss,... ...she's a musical artiste. Just play the background voice and she'll sync the act. Come on, dear. -Both of you, you'd better leave. Aren't we good? -You'd better get out. Don't worry, I'll bring someone else. She will fall in place. -Chitti! She's not my fault. -Boss, how about her? She's perfect for you. I want a girl for him. Stop torturing me. You know how choosy I was in selecting a girl to get married. This is a girl I used to love. Imagine how she'd be. None of these girl will suit. -Correct..... She must act well and she must be someone we know very well. Then this is our only option. Now I know what your dad is going through. If you don't find a girl here,... ...then you'd better get a visa and go to Kailasa. Just come, dude. This play is by my friend, Deepika. Please accept her. I'll somehow get her to act. Or I'll have to come with you disguised as a girl. Shut up. Your look is causing a riot in my heart... In no time, I've fallen for you... You are the rainbow that descended down to earth... You took me down like a storm... That's the first time Vikram saw Preethi. He didn't expect that he'd meet a girl... ...exactly like the one he imagined. The rain, breeze and her strawberry fragrance from his imagination... ...he could feel them. He doubted if the universe was really making his wish come true. I do not understand... I'm looking at you... Buddy, she's perfect, right? -Yes, okay. Thank goodness. -But not your friend. That girl in the centre. She's perfect. No way. -Please, dude. No way, buddy. -Buddy, please. Dude, I don't even know her. It won't workout, forget about her. As simple as that. So, if you can help..... Are you kidding me? No way. Please, just for one evening. Why should I act like your girlfriend? Not his girlfriend, but as his ex-girlfriend. Whatever, why should I act? Correct, but we didn't find anyone else suitable. Please, just for two hours. -What? Two hours? Do I look like a call taxi to you? -Deepika please explain to her. What's there for her to explain? Deepika, don't support them for such matters. Do you know what this is called? Deception. If caught, we'll be in prison. You won't be replacing anyone to call it deception. I hate all this. Just leave me out of it. Excuse me. Tell her. Excuse me. -Preethi! Excuse me, please hear us out. Just for a day. Poor guy, Preethi. Help him. -Hey! Please listen to me. -Find someone else. She left. Good morning, students. -Good morning, ma'am. How could you forget me... Forget it. Now that we are here, let's at least play on the slide. His leg are too long to play on the slide. I must blame myself for bringing you along. You are of no use. Come on. Let's think of where we'll meet her next. Here's your coffee, disturbing you is our hobby. Please, even this coffee shop is a great location. Just talk to her for an hour. Excuse me! -Please, madam. What was that all about? She ordered her drink and left. To hell with her. Milk, coffee, sugar. What are you doing? -I got upset. Come, let's leave. Let's leave before they bring the bill. If we had gone to a temple, we would have got some blessing. Please hear me out. Just one time. Please! Please, just once. Preethi, hear me out. Please. -Keep going. Please! Preethi! Look, it'll not get you anywhere by following me. Please hear me out. -You hear me out. Oh, no! Vanakkam, madam. It said vanilla and strawberry, I thought they were candies. Don't bill it. Go and find someone else. Please leave me out of it. Thank goodness. What did she say? She's showing off too much. Forget her. We'll find someone else. Why are you so stressed, grandpa? You do not take your medicine promptly. That's not true. I take them on time. Then what's the problem? -If I tell you the problem,... ...will you understand? -What is it? Me and Sanjay? Are we your problem? -You guys are not a problem. It's responsibility. I have responsibilities. Age is a factor here. -You aren't too old yet. I'm not talking about my age. But yours. Who will take care of you and Sanjay when my time is up? Please get married soon. Grandpa, how many times do I tell you? We are just fine. What's the rush to get married? I want to concentrate on my career. So, please. -I..... Just walk. What took you so long? I was waiting for you. What did the doctor say? The doctor prescribed a few medicines. He must eat them on time. And he's advised not to stress himself out. That's tough with both of you in his life. So, how is your play going on? Rehearsals. It's going on well, aunty. What's the big deal? Back in our days, we too performed great shows. Do you know something? -Go ahead and tell me. Raja is interested in plays too. Even yesterday,... ...he watched a play in the US and uploaded a photo on Instagram. Who is Raja? Well, he is our..... Be quiet. Do you Remember Radha? Her husband? -That bald man? Raja is his classmate, from the US. He has a good job and earns a fortune. But aunty..... Don't say a word. I know what you would say. He is in San Jose. Go there and perform your play at San Jose Tamil Sangam. Who would stop you? San Jose. Do you really want to let this opportunity slip? Settle down when you find someone good. Correct. Look, she's already blushing. I've shared your FB profile and he loves you. Love? -He likes you a lot. I gave him your number. He even saw your photo on FB. If you check out his photo on FB and like him,... ...then he said he'll make a video call over the weekend. Such a gentleman, you know? -Yes, dear. I feel he's a nice guy too. -Just agree to this. We'll talk to his parents by next month... ...and ask him to come down in two months. Why don't you talk to him? -Yes. Let us know at once if you like him. If possible, we can get you both engaged over a Skype call. I often get dizzy these days. If I marry you off to a nice guy soon..... Will you stop it? I'm not ready for marriage now. What do you mean? -If you're not ready, then when? Please consider my situation too, dear. Is there any reason that you're not ready now? Are you in love with someone..... -Yes, I'm in love. Okay. So, this is the deal. Tomorrow, I'll come with you for dinner. I shall talk to your fiancee as your girlfriend. Excuse me, ex-girlfriend. -Whatever. Why the sudden change of mind? Can we trust you? If it means the welfare of four people, then it is fine. One, two, three. Who's the fourth person? My grandpa. -Grandpa? Now what you must do is,... ...act as my boyfriend in front of my grandpa. As your boyfriend? -Yes. If I can play as your girlfriend, why can't you play as my boyfriend? Excuse me, ex-girlfriend. -Whatever. You need someone to play your boyfriend, right? Here, take my buddy, Chitti, as your boyfriend. Buddy, I'm not interested. But then again, it's okay. Hello, my grandpa has taste. -Will he taste me? If I take him home, my grandpa would get upset and he would... ...marry me off to someone else. You look apt. Dude, does it feels good to know you're better looking than me? Preethi, I'm getting married soon. How can I..... Now, that's the best part. You betrayed me and married some other girl. Due to love failure, I'll postpone my marriage for two years. Deal or no deal? Buddy, she's more shrewd than a businessman. Don't agree to it. Move aside. Please sit down. I am Vikram. Preethi..... -I know, Preethi told me. Have some tea. So, what do you do? I am a radio jockey. -Jockey? So, are you good at riding horses..... I work in a radio station. -Railway station? Back in my days, they used meter gauge. Now they have upgraded to broad gauge and so on. It's not railway station. I work in a radio station. Radio station? Are you a newscaster? No, sir. I host a show called Theera Ula. Those days, radio stations had good anchors and played good songs. Kids these days do crazy stuff. -Preethi's boyfriend? She never told me about you. As if you're an elder. Why should she tell you? Go inside. Do you like cricket, sir? It was my bread and butter once upon a time. Do you know Lala Amarnath? Kids these days know nothing. Recently our FM station conducted a special show for IPL. Please don't call what they play these days as cricket. Those days, they played without helmet in uncovered pitches. Even a club bowler could break the batsman's jaw. Times have changed. Even I fell in love during my youth. My family found out and got me married. Superb, sir. You had a love marriage back then? I was married off to another girl and she to another man. Fine, let's come to the point. So, you're coming to the point only now? Preethi told me everything. I was worried about how to get her settle down. To know that she's mature enough to choose her life partner,... ...it makes me really happy. I don't know about you. But I'm very confident that Preethi won't make a wrong choice. I never wanted Preethi to miss her parents,... ...hence I never interfered in her choices. When she said that she's in love, I felt very happy. At the same time, I'm worried too. Relationships are not how it used to be. Even a small issues lead to break up and divorce. But as far as I'm concerned, there is no love without issues. But there are no issues in love that cannot be solved. Grandpa asked when we can have the marriage? This month or next month? -What? Calm down, boyfriend. Grandpa fell for your acting. Your grandpa is one serious guy. I felt so bad for him. Don't worry, I'll handle him. So when is your dinner meet? Tomorrow at 8 pm, Somerset. Don't forget. And your name is Aishwarya. We met near an ATM. -Adyar, right? Madam, we travelled from Besant Nagar to Adyar. Okay. -Okay, clear? Yeah. -Superb. Bye. Good evening, sir. Good evening, ma'am. Good evening. We don't charge for looking at the menu, sir. Yeah, right. Two minutes. -Okay, sir. Vikram, are you okay? -I am okay. You look nervous to me. No, I am not nervous, I am absolutely cool. Where is she? Why is Aishwarya not here yet? -She should be here by now. Anjali meet Preethi. Preethi meet... ...Anjali. You said her name was Aishwarya. Did I say Aishwarya? Must have been a mistake. Because the name Preethi is lengthy,... ...her grandpa shortened it to Aishwarya and..... Is Preethi a lengthy name? Yes, her grandpa is unsound. Is it Preethi or Aishwarya? -Bottle or regular water, sir? Bottle is fine. Preethi is fine. -Nice to meet you, Preethi. Preethi, do you remember your first meeting? Well, go on, tell her. It was on November 3rd, 2017? Yes, of course, November 3rd. It was a Friday night, just after a heavy downpour. It was in Besant Nagar, I went to the ATM and came out. It started raining again. I saw Vikram for the first time in that rain. You appeared like a flash in front of me... You swept me off like a storm... I wanted to talk to him. So I used the rain as an excuse and stood next to him. A beautiful girl was standing next to him. Does she need any help? He never even bothered to ask. Guys can only flirt on Whatsapp and Facebook. But in person, they are useless. -Then what happened? Then what? As usual I took the first step. Hi. I can't open my car door. Can you please help me? He somehow managed to open the car, not bad. I thought he would pick a chat after that. But he went and started his bike. Do you know the route to Adyar? -I'll be taking that route. You can follow me. I am born and brought up in Chennai. He took me to Adyar via Anna Nagar. Well, that..... It was one way all the way. So I took her all across Anna Nagar and..... Excuse me, there is a call. Buddy, is everything okay? Is Anjali convinced? Buddy, even I am convinced. She is really something. I cooked up a story. She took it and made it sound like a true story. What about Anjali? -That's it. I don't know what is going to happen. So who proposed first? I did. -I did. I proposed. But I didn't hear it. -Didn't hear it? Didn't hear it? -The place was too noisy. I couldn't hear what he said. Where did you propose, Vikram? Where did I first propose? In a pub. -Pub? Pub? That was out of nowhere. -Vikram, do you drink? Do I drink? He can't sleep without boozing at night. Back then, I boozed. -Ma'am, here is your main course. Ma'am, menu. -Thank you. Why did you tell her I drink? -Why did you call my grandpa crazy? Is that okay? So how did you propose? That..... -I'll tell you. I love you. Which pub plays a song like this? Allow me to tell you how he proposed to me. Preethi! Preethi! What? What? I don't get it, Vikram. Can you say that again? Is that how you proposed? All right, tell her how you proposed. Tell her. -January 11th, 2018. It was on Thiruvanmiyur Beach, around 6 am. Preethi, I have an idea for my late night talk show. Is it? -A talk show named Theera Ula. Anything and everything about love. I told Chitti about it, he feels it is okay. Don't mind him, anyway it sounds interesting to me. Yes, they wanted me to host a celebrity,... ...but I thought of this and suggested it. I love you. -What was that? Nothing, I said I love it. Your talk show idea. Stop fooling me. I have done a ton of shows till now. Have you ever listened to any one of my shows? Even last week I did a show..... I love you. -What did you just say? Nothing. What did you hear? -You said something. It's the same thing that you said in the pub. Just say it loud then. I can't. -Tell me, Preethi! I said, tell me. I love you. I love you, Vikram. If you keep smiling, I will keep on telling you. I love you. What? Dessert, right? I will get it. If you don't mind, can I know why you and Vikram broke up? It did not work out. He wanted to settle down. But I was not ready for the commitment. That created a gap between us and here we are. Anjali, can I ask you something? Why are you so interested in a relationship that is over? Like whatever we had, it was in the past. Vikram told me that you are writing a book. Is that why? -Yes, that is one of the reasons. And I also wanted to ask someone about the guy I'm going to marry. Who is better than his ex-girlfriend? Sorry if I disturbed you. -Not at all. Friends? Friends. Okay, it was nice meeting you both. -It was lovely meeting you. I'll see you, take care. -Bye. Bye. -Yeah, bye. Vikram, thanks for spending your precious time with me. You know, technically this is our first date. Bye, take care. Sir! Madam left her wallet. Shall I ask him? -Isn't this Preethi's wallet? Sir! Can you tell me which ATM you met her? Vikram? What are you doing here? Why didn't you call me? -Your phone is switched off. Who is it at this odd hour? -It's Vikram, grandpa. Grandpa, I'm going with Vikram for a walk on the beach. Walk? Here. Hello, why should I come for a walk with you now? I told a believable story to your fiancee, right? Now, my grandpa should believe me. So come along with me. So, did you come to the theatre play only to find a girl... ...or are you really interested in it? That was my first time. But I liked it the first time. Right? I like it a lot too. I love performing on stage, the audience would clap at the end. I just love it. Right from childhood,... ...I used to participate in every art competition. By the time I finished school, theatre play was my life. I did Performance Arts in college. When I was doing that, grandpa appreciated and encouraged me. But now he wants me to get married and stop acting. It's very hard to convince him. Preethi, are you always like this? Talking non stop? I just speak my heart out without hesitation. I'm quite the opposite to you. I do not talk much, even on the phone. Then, don't you go out for nightwalks like this? If it is someone I really like, I'll go. Vikram, what did your fiancee say? She didn't say anything. -She said nothing? Even after all those stories I told her? All right, what did your grandpa say? My grandpa said that you are an okay choice. Just okay? Sarcasm? I'm just kidding. Anyway, thanks to you. For one year, I can work peacefully. Grandpa is always worried about me. He has only me and Sanjay. So what are you doing at present? There is a very handsome guy opposite my house. I am trying to woo him. What? Aren't girls allowed to woo guys? I didn't say that. -Just kidding. There is this new play named 'Kannanin Kadhali'. I'm rehearsing for it. You know, Vikram, I want to be a successful actor. I want to travel all over the world. I want to perform on every stage possible. That's my dream. What about you, Vikram? Dream? That's too big a word for me. I do not follow any plans in life. I just go with the flow. That's it. -Okay, so, it's like going... ...on this unplanned walk in the night with a girl like me, is it? Hello. I came because you asked me, that's it. I didn't call you. I only told my grandpa. You could have just left. I was worried about a beautiful girl going out alone in the night. Okay, a mediocre girl, is that fine? You seem to know many pick up lines. None of them have worked out. Do you think it's working? Whatever you are saying is cute. -But no. You cannot impress me so easily. -At least I am trying. I'm seriously asking you, have you never been in love? I wish I could have. But it never happened. Maybe I became tired of searching for a girl who suits me. So, is Anjali your dream girl? You know, Vikram,... ...people feel love is like some rocket science. As far as I'm concerned, there is magic in love. We can definitely feel it. If you had said this to me a few days ago,... ...I might have not understood it. But now, I do understand. We may live in a busy city. But this place, this peace, I'm very fond of it. We always search for things that we don't have. We always desire for it. That's life, isn't it? The same applies to love. Why can't you tell your grandpa about your love for theatre? Why are you complicating it? Why can't you tell Anjali that all this is a lie? The things we do for love. You are one lucky guy, dude. You keep lying and yet, you don't get caught. Come on, I was so scared. Thankfully everything went well. Anjali didn't have any doubt. Boss! -Here he comes. That's how girls are. They don't fall for the nice guys and they never doubt the bad guys. That's a forward message, right? -My own lines. How is it? Pathetic. Now, get lost. -Truth is always bitter. How do I run this pub with workers like him? I was looking for you everywhere. Six phones (calls) from Anjali. -Select any two and leave the rest. But how did she get your number? We exchanged numbers in the restaurant yesterday. Weren't you there? I told you not to exchange any details. Then why do you do all this? Anjali is calling again. -Anjali? Don't answer. What if she mistakes her? Don't ask me. -Hold on. Dude, what do we do? Don't answer. -Hi, Anjali. Yeah, okay. She is inviting me for her engagement shopping. Tell her no to shopping. Tell her! -Dude, what can I do? Sure, not a problem. I'll come. Look what she's saying. -I told you this girl is crazy. Tell her. -Did she hear me? No. Vikram, right? It's not a problem at all. Dude, tell her. -He is our guy. I'll convince him. Okay, all right. Bye, take care. Preethi, what are you up to? Why is she calling her? She has returned from US after a decade. She's not in touch with her friends. She is always accompanied by her family wherever she goes. So, she's calling me. -Right, she's a tourist guide. I told you not to go shopping with her. Why did you agree? Well, next Friday, my grandpa wanted to go for a movie. You won't help me for nothing, right? Now, you must return a favour. -Is your grandpa so free? Why does he want to play cupid? -Nothing of that sort. He can't finalise him with one meeting. Will you come or not? -I told you the first day,... ...she's more shrewd than a businessman. You shouldn't have agreed. -Deal or no deal? Oh, no! His face tells me that he'll agree to this. I find myself so handsome these days... I can feel my heartbeat rise... I am a whole new person and it's confusing... I just don't get it... I can't see the zebra crossing... All I see is the green light... I am a whole new person and it's confusing... I just don't get it... I am losing myself... My hormones are peaking... My heart is tempted... I'm flying high like a kite... With an intact dream... My heart stays firm... No matter what you do... With an intact dream... My heart stays firm... No matter what you do... I feel everything going my way... I don't understand anything... With an intact dream... My heart stays firm... No matter what you do... With an intact dream... My heart stays firm... No matter what you do... I feel everything going my way... Where is the manager? I want to see the manager now. Who do you think you're cheating? I'm a bank manager. -I'll write about this on Facebook. -Cool, sir. Cool. -Why are you upset? What happened? -Nothing's left to happen. You aren't serving as promised on the menu. Everything looks fine, sir. -What is this? This is mixed peanuts with chef's secret recipe... ...with onion, tomato and lemon. -Boiled peanuts. This? Summertime salad with tropical ingredients. Cucumber. Fine, I can overlook all these. Then do it. -What is this? Cilantro dip. -Coriander chutney. Boss, he's roasting you. -Watch me roast him now. Sorry, sir. I feel sorry for your bad experience. Don't worry, I'll arrange a special dish for you. Lemon marinated with 11 secret spices. Fine, ask them to get it. Superb, boss. That was a good come back. That was one lengthy name. What's that dish? Lemon pickle. -A lemon pickle for the gentleman! He looks like a meat bone and he wants to correct us. Forget him, boss. Let's focus on our brother. Buddy! What are you gifting Anjali for her birthday? I'm still confused. I'm planning to gift her a smartphone. Smart idea. A smartphone? Awesome. From night to dawn, you can romance. Even Samy says it's romantic. So, that gift is rejected. Boss, how about some bucket biryani? How about some mutton paya and fried fish? Get lost! Dude, a gift should be a little personal. Let's invite all her friends and host a party for her birthday. You can also announce your engagement to your friends. Anjali will be impressed. Boss, now that we've decided to throw her a party,... ...let's choose a better pub to conduct it. Can you ask them to pay you? -I was kidding, boss. But I don't know any of her friends. Dude, there were so many cousins when we went to see her. Let's invite them. Let the whole family celebrate with us. If we invite all of them, must we invite Preethi too? Are you nuts? Don't invite Preethi. -Fine, I'm not inviting her. Don't even invite her by mistake. It'll lead to problems. Fine. I won't invite her. Mix Thala and Thalapathy's song and give us a Thalaivar's song. The party must be top notch. Let's rock it. Dude, the DJ is ready and so are the guests. Shall we start the party? -Wait. What? Guys like him are desperately waiting to get sloshed. Dude, let's wait for a few minutes. -Brother, isn't that what... ...we are here for. How long do we wait? Calm down, dude. Dude, let's start the party now. Start the party now? Who is it? Cute girl, follow me... Please allow me into your heart... Cute girl, follow me... Please allow me into your heart... Cute girl, follow me... Please allow me into your heart... Cute girl, follow me... Please allow me into your heart... A cutie with arrogance in her beauty... You're like the rain during the day... Let me take you out and surprise you... I am ready, are you... The moment I fall for you... I could feel the sparkle in my heart... Cutie, I want to travel the whole world with you... I am ready, are you.. Tell me when you're free, we shall FaceTime... Let's be good friends, so no showing off... You shine like the moon... I shine bright like the cell phone... I was in zen mode but your beauty disturbed me... Cute girl, follow me... Please allow me into your heart... Follow me... Please allow me into your heart... What did you do to me... You just stole my heart... What did you do to me... You just stole my heart... Miss Money Heist Nairobi, you are my sweety... Let's start a journey, only you and me... No poems and no tears... No roses, I just want to be a gentleman... Your eyes are confusing me, I'm stunned by your beauty... Even if you 'unfollow' me... I'll put my ego aside and come running to you... Tell me when you're free, we shall FaceTime... Let's be good friends, so no showing off... You shine like the moon... I shine brigh like the cell phone... I was in zen mode but your beauty disturbed me... Cute girl, follow me... Please allow me into your heart... Cute girl, follow me... Please allow me into your heart... What did you do to me... You just stole my heart.... What did you do to me... You just stole my heart... Hi! -Hey! The party isn't over yet. What are you doing here? Just took a break. -Finding solace in solitude? Stop teasing, Vikram. You were right, Vikram. There is beauty in life when you go with the flow unplanned. How? Like I'm right here next to you, unplanned. Like this? No, you lie to go with the flow with no plans. Like that. If a harmless small lie can spread happiness,... ...then there is nothing wrong in it. Only until that lie turns into the truth. Preethi, do you believe in destiny? Not much. I believe that our life is in our hands. Is it so easy like you say? I doubt it. I'm leaving. -Why so soon? It's late. I'm leaving. My brother would be waiting for me. Preethi! I'll come with you. -Where? To the parking lot. The food was yummy, right? -I know. Hi. Okay, I'll see you soon. -Okay, bye. Vikram. Vikram, I have written many love stories. But I have never been in love with anybody. I'm afraid of falling in love. When you love someone, you're giving them a space to hurt you. Hence, I was hesitant. But once I met you,... ...I couldn't stop myself from falling for you. Your fun-loving attitude, your smile, I love them. And I know that you will never hurt me. I love you. You are going to be engaged to Anjali,... ...but you say you're in love with Preethi? Well, it's Preethi. When we see the person we love, our heart will tell us. Just like that, when I see Preethi..... Do you feel butterflies in your stomach? Squash those butterflies and you'll be fine. Chitti, meeting Anjali, then lying to her,... ...the connection I felt with nobody before,... ...I feel all this led me to Preethi. Mr. Warner is warming up. You can't even bend down, why are you playing cricket? Boss, your fear of losing is making you blabber. Is it? You play, Mr. Dhoni. -Mind you. That is an abdomen guard. What are you doing with it? The guard is giving me problems. Even God is giving you problems, what can we do? Bowl to the right. What happened? Game over? Why are you gargling? Oh, no! The ball is crushed. It's not the ball that got crushed..... Hello, people. What an amazing song it was. This is Theera Ula and this is your RJ Vikram. Call me and tell me about your love. After a short break, I'll be right back. Hi, Anjali. -Hi, Vikram, are you free now? The show is going on, anything urgent? Okay, when will it end? We just started, it'll take some time. All right, bye. -Bye. Vikram! Hi..... -Hi! Anjali, what are you doing here? I was waiting for your program to end. You could have informed me. I didn't know. It's okay, I didn't want to impose. -Okay. What is the matter? Matter? The matter is that you are coming with me now. Where are we going, Anjali? -That is a surprise. Where in OMR? -You drive, I'll tell you the way. I've been listening to your programs. You love retro songs, am I right? After my mom passed away,... ...my father and I go to sleep listening to songs on the radio. So I naturally formed a connection to the radio. From the way you talk about music,... ...I can see how much you love your job. Really? So is this place a secret? You kept the birthday party a secret from me too. Just wait for sometime, you'll love this. Come in, Vikram. After our marriage, I want us to start our life in this place. This is my gift to us. Before I met you, my life was already perfect. But after meeting you... ...I feel that everything around me has become beautiful. The same way, after our marriage,... ...in the house we are going to live,... ...I want everything around you to look beautiful,... ...including me. And I'm in love with you, Vikram. As my desires reach for the sky... My clothes turn into threads... My eyes become your mirror... As my desires reach for the sky... My clothes turn into threads... My eyes become your mirror... Your touch is the key which unlocks me... Your smell is the hook that catches me... I wish we could be all alone... Let's hug and kiss as we unite in love... Tell me why only our souls unite... As my desires reach for the sky... My clothes turn into threads... My eyes become your mirror... I feel your warmth as we roll in together... Let our mornings start with a kiss... Let us make a fitting love story... Let us stay together in happiness... Let me shower you with kisses... And let those kisses help our love bloom... The mark of passionate love that you leave on me... Make me ask for more... Our love will be everlasting... With you always by my side... Like a wonderful dream... We'll live a life of compassion that everyone longs for... Lets hug and kiss as we unite in love... Tell me why only our souls united... What is this? What is this thing? Every time I come to this pub, I face this same problem. No one here has discipline. The menu shows something, but you serve something else. You give them confusing names too. Go. I want to see your manager now. I want to see the manager now, call him. Here he is. -What is this? Cocktail. -What does it contain? 30 ml rum, 30 ml vodka, some mint..... Hold on a minute. -Sugar and crushed ice. One second. -Is he writing us the bill? What is this, boss? -30 ml rum, Rs50. What else? Vodka, Rs30. And mint, Rs2. Sir, we add just a pinch. -Okay. I'm going to kill you. However I calculate, it does not cross Rs100. But you sell it for Rs450. Do you think no one would ask? You are right. Since you are asking,... ...won't it be cheaper to prepare this at home? How can I do it at home? My wife will hit me with a slipper. The additional charges are to cover those slipper shots. You want the slipper shot or the drink? Is he blushing? -Buddy, where are you? Tell me. -I met Anjali yesterday. I told you not to meet Preethi... You met Anjali? What have you done? Well, Anjali came after the show. We went for a drive in OMR. Buddy, you go to OMR for a drive with Anjali,... ...then you party with Preethi. You are on a different level. She took me to a house and said that it is a wedding gift. Buddy, did you score even before the game began? Stop irritating me. I'm going to meet Preethi now. I want to talk to her and put an end to this. What are you guys doing? We can't be playful all the time. Vikram! -Hi! So, how is your love life? -Where is Preethi? Since she started hanging out with you, she rarely comes here. We have rehearsal today. Okay, one minute. Girls, we have the show in two hours. Are you at least going to practice once seriously or not? The crow flew to a distant tree and sat on the branch... ...to eat the fritter. At that time, a fox came by. That fox said hi to the crow. But the crow was not at all interested to talk to the fox. The fox came to say sorry. It has come to speak openly to the crow. The crow told the fox, "I've nothing to tell you,... ...please go." It was not my mistake, Preethi. That day I felt something.... Are you going to leave or not? Preethi, please listen to me. I am waiting here for you, but you're just walking away. I didn't kiss you that day with any intention. Vikram, please. You asked me to act, I acted. It's over. Preethi, at least listen to what I have to say. What did I do..... -I have nothing to speak. Please, Vikram. There is no need for this conversation. Preethi! These days, social media is just plain irritating. Everybody talks about feminism. We need more energy to see these things. Definitely. -Look at this girl. If a handsome guy follows her,... ...she'll say, "Such a romantic person he is". But if a not-so-good-looking guy follows her, he's a stalker. It's a matter of consent. That aside, in recent times,... ...more than newspaper and TV, social media looks much depressing. I totally keep away from it. -Well, that's right. So what is going on between you and Vikram? Why are you not talking to him? Why are you avoiding him? What? Did he send you to mediate? -Of course not, I'm just curious. I have no issues with Vikram. He asked me to act and I acted. That's it. That's it? Well, your recent sketches tell a different story. I'm just asking. What happened? -Anjali. Who? -Vikram's fiancee. Where is she? -Come here. What are you doing? Just keep coming. -Let me get that dress. Preethi, hey. -She saw you. Hi. -Hi. What a surprise! -Yes. I found time only now, so we are doing our shopping. Anjali, this is my friend, Deepika. Hi. -Hi. Mom, dad, this is Preethi and Deepika, Vikram's friends. Hi. -Oh, okay. I'll bring the car to the main entrance and you join us there. See you. Anjali, have you invited Preethi? Dad, I wanted to go to her house and invite her. The marriage is very near. You should have done it already. Whatever, your wish. Bye. Preethi, I wanted to come to your house this evening. Next Friday, we have our pre-engagement party. I guess Vikram would have invited you already. Anyway, I'm also inviting you, so you must come. Anjali, I have a play next week, in Pondicherry, so I can't. That is on Sunday. -Perfect. The party is on Friday. Don't give any excuses. You two must come. No, Anjali, but... No chance, Preethi, you must come. My dad is waiting, I have to go. Sign wherever you see the X mark. -What is this, sir? In all the signature columns, you have marked wrong. To tell you that taking a loan is wrong. Sign. -What? He is kidding, just sign. -I'm scared. This will not cause us any problem, right? We are starting a new pub. We are the owners of the place. What mortgage do you have to take this loan? This pub. Here you go. -Oh, no! This will put us in trouble. I'm going to put you in trouble now. Trouble is here. Boss, what are you doing here? This is my pub, remember? Oh, yes. -Yes, boss. Fine, what is the deep discussion you're having with this fool? Hello, I'm a bank manager,... ...your main customer. You'd better show some respect. I don't respect someone who offers loan for free drinks. I will assure that you get smacked by your wife. Stop staring with your owl eyes. Get out of here. The boss is always right. -Where are you going? Boss, I am..... -What is this loan for? It is to develop our pub. -The two of you? Yes, boss, we have many more ideas like this. I have a better idea than this. -What is that? To fire both of you. Please, boss. -Forgive us, we made a mistake. Go to the kitchen. Get lost. -Thanks a lot. These glasses are trying to become bottles. Boss, I have a doubt. Do you want to know if you mixed water? No, boss. -Then? Look there. -Anjali's cousins are here. Don't flirt around. -It's not that, boss. Neither this nor that. You usually never think beyond that. Boss, an important matter. -Tell me. Look at Vikram. He looks disturbed to me. -Of course, he is. Handling one girl in a relationship is itself a daunting task. Now there are two girls in Vikram's life. Obviously he'll be disturbed. Don't worry, I will talk too him in my style and cheer him up. Save your cheer or queer. Turn down your volume and go. How will others hear if I turn my volume down? I can hear you. Excellent arrangement, sir, it's first class. Sir, superb. You nailed it by bringing these amazing girls to the party. Those are my family members. -Say 'our' family members. Sir, the bride's father has brought in such a big crowd to the party. You are the bridegroom's dad. Shouldn't you do something to bring the place down? Bring the place down? What are you doing here? We are the groom's friends. We should pull their legs. Are you the groom's friend? What nonsense is this? Chitti, take him away. I asked you to chug beer and not bore them. Come, enough of your nonsense. -Wait, I need to ask something. Sorry, sir. Are you upset? I'm asking if you are upset? Why the long face? -Well, Preethi..... Shall I tell you something? All your friends,... ...family, Anjali's people, all of them are here. Her dad has thrown this big party just to announce your engagement. Please, for today. Today alone,... ...forget all your confusions and put on a smiling face. Pick it up. I'd like to give a toast. Anjali's engagement, I still can't believe it. Things happened so fast. Even Anjali wouldn't have expected this. One day, the groom's parents came to meet Anjali. Vikram and Anjali were about to meet. Generally, it is the bride's family that panics before a marriage. But we were feeling sorry for Vikram. The thing that Anjali likes the most is love. She writes decent stories. She even copies a bit from other stories. Vikram, isn't anyone making a toast to you? Even during schooldays, I don't like writing slam books. I don't like Facebook and Instagram write ups either. Excuse me. Till now, we have only seen Anjali writing stories. But this is the first time we are seeing her in love. To Anjali and Vikram. How come your glass has more alcohol than mine? I have mixed water, you are drinking neat. You guys only think about food and booze. Why don't you give a toast to me? -Toast? What toast do you want? Ask me. Anyway, it's useless, just say it. For chili cheese toast, go to the third counter. For chicken toast, go to the fourth counter. For chocolate toast, the fifth counter. But they won't give us. They serve only to the kids. But I skilfully stole and ate them secretly. He stole food and takes pride in it. Come on, boss. -Keep quiet. What will I talk all of a sudden? Give me some notes. Vikram. Vikram is a good friend. What I like about him most is the way he looks at life. Life is very simple. But we over-think and complicate life. He says that often. I didn't realise it first, but now I get it. He is a huge influence on everyone's life around him. And Vikram cannot lie. If he does, he gets caught easily. He will apologise even if it's not his fault. Whenever you are in trouble and ask Vikram for help,... ...he will definitely give a solution. And you know what, Anjali? You are the luckiest woman in the world. There's the scapegoat, time to celebrate... Book the marriage hall, time to celebrate... There's the scapegoat, time to celebrate... Book the marriage hall, time to celebrate... Here's the handsome groom in a fancy suit... Here's the bride that he's going to become crazy for... The bride seems to be a drama queen and a naughty girl... She is going to fall head over heels for him... So give it up for this couple and their happily ever after... Let's celebrate this couple and their happily ever after... So give it up for this couple and their happily ever after... Let's celebrate this couple and their happily ever after... There's the scapegoat, time to celebrate... Book the marriage hall, time to celebrate... There's the scapegoat, time to celebrate... Book the marriage hall, time to celebrate... You must admire her every day... You must give her gifts without asking... You should do the dishes whenever she tells you... Learn from the internet if you don't know... If you can keep up with your words, it's best for you two... Yeah, they are a perfect pair, made for each other... This is the fairytale the people gasp at... You both are hashtag couple goal... She is a cutie, ready for you... So don't let go of her, oh, deity... Wait until she is ready... She's the one for you, now hug her... It's your party and so you rock and roll... Let's celebrate this couple and their happily ever after... So give it up for this couple and their happily ever after... Let's celebrate this couple and their happily ever after... She is a cutie, ready for you... So don't let go of her... Wait until she is ready... She's the one for you. Now, go and hug her... Who is that girl? -Which girl? The girl who made the toast. -Who? Preethi? Yes. -She's my friend. She spoke very well, right? Your college friend? Has she been to our house? -No, dad. I know her through Chitti. What is she doing? Dad, why are you asking all this? Balasubramaniam is looking for a bride for his son. He asked me about the girl. So, I am asking. Do you still look for brides? Am I going to participate in a marathon at this age? You are fortunate to find a good girl. When I started looking for brides for you, Balu also started. But he is still looking. I guess she already has a boyfriend. Dad, go on, I have some work. At this hour? Do whatever you want. Welcome. -Preethi? She is inside. Preethi. Preethi. Preethi, please listen to me. I deserve to explain, Preethi. Can you hear me or not? Preethi. Is he the boy? Why is he here at this hour? I think they fought. -They fought? Didn't you inquire? We must find out such things and solve it. You are a grown man. Do I have to teach you all this? Preethi..... -Vikram! Please don't talk about anything. I don't want to listen. It might be a coincidence that we met. But it is predestined. We're meant to be with each other. Every moment I spent with you is not a lie. I like you a lot, Preethi. I love you. I know you like me too. Vikram, this won't work between us. Why do you say that? When I am with you..... When I kissed you that day..... I..... I felt the love you have for me. Don't deny it. Vikram, wait. Let me speak. This won't work between us. You are not thinking practically. You're going to be married soon. It is wrong even to talk about this. Even if you respect me a little, don't talk to me about this again. So, you never felt my love? What about the toast you made? -Vikram, please. Forget about all that. There's nothing between us. We were acting out a lie. It is a fake story. A fake love. Let it remain fake. Preethi, the story might have been fake. But the love is not fake. I believe it. The purpose of my life is you... You are my lifeline... What would I do without you... You are my life... The purpose of my life is you... You are my lifeline... What would I do without you... You are my life... Even if you break my heart into pieces... I will protect you with all my heart... Even if you hate every inch of me... I will live with your lasting memories... You are present in the every music I hear... You are all around me... Even if my pain fades away... My love for you will not fade... The purpose of my life is you... You are my lifeline... What would I do without you... You are my life... The purpose of my life is you... You are my lifeline... What would I do without you... You are my life... The purpose of my life is you... You are my lifeline... What would I do without you... You are my life... Check if the guestlist is prepared... ..,and the rooms are allotted accordingly. Don't wait for me for everything, take you own decisions if needed. Don't delay anything. -Okay, uncle. Did you see the time? You haven't taken your medicine. What do you expect? It's my only daughter's wedding. So I am giving my all. Then again, we should take care of certain things personally. Dad, it's no big deal. Let others take up the work. You should relax, be happy and don't worry about the marriage. How can I not worry? Tons of things are going on in my mind. Am I doing things correctly? Are things going right? Not only that,... ...the thought of sending my girl away is bothering me too. I am not going anywhere. I'll be right here. Just a call away. And, dad, Vikram is a really sweet guy. If you spend time with him, you'll understand. I'll do one thing. After our wedding shopping,... ...I'll invite him for dinner someday. You guys can get to know each other. Why not? -Okay. Why did he ask us to assemble? What is this all about? I have no clue. Don't you know? -Our business is dull. If you have any constructive ideas to develop the pub, please tell me. Let's call Sunny Leone to inaugurate our pub,... ...people will flock our place, just like in Kerala. Why? To kick me? Boss, if we give offers, people will throng here. One punch and blood will throng out of your mouth. Boss, let's change our bar setup to..... How many times have I told, this is a pub and not a bar. Aren't bar and pub the same? -There goes! Listen to me. In a bar, people drink and dance. But in a pub, people dance and drink. In a bar, you buy sides for the drink. But in a pub, you buy drink for the sides. In a bar, there is no entry for girls. In a pub, you get free entry only with girls. People cannot enter a bar after 10 pm. People enter a pub only after 10 pm. That was amazing, boss. -What am I going to do with you? Boss, you forgot a point. -What is it? Workers get paid in a bar. -Okay. Workers don't get paid in a pub. You're going to get it from me. -What else to expect from you? Boss, a customer is calling me. I'll be back. He will give you some too. Leave. And I'm paying two useless bouncers too. Which is the best out of these three sarees, Vikram? Help me decide. Personally, I love this colour the best. The design looks interesting too. I am good with whichever you choose. As simple as that. Marriage life is as simple as that. Just say okay to everything your wife says... ...and you won't have problems This one? -Looks very beautiful on you. Vikram! How is this? Do you like it? Yes, it's good. Yeah, nice. There, even the groom said it. Vikram, what happened? What? -Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. -Why do you look dull? Nothing. -Don't lie, Vikram. Something is wrong. I can read it on your face. I told you, it's nothing. Why do you keep asking me? I've been noticing you, the last few weeks you have been..... It's okay. Take your time. Tell me when you feel like sharing. If you don't feel like sharing, then leave it. We can even cancel dinner plans tonight. I'll talk to my family. Now, did I ask you to cancel dinner plans? What are you looking at? Uncle was adamant that... ...he'll cook today since you're coming for dinner. Quiet now. Dad loves cooking. Cooking is his hobby. He loves cooking for his loved ones. Learn from him. You too should do all this after marriage. Hi, Vikram. What are you doing here? Dinner is ready. -Uncle, I was just..... Would you like a drink? -No, thanks. Can I? -Yeah, sure. Vikram, I am very happy today. Usually a girl's father would have a huge ego. An ego that nobody can take care of his daughter like he does. But today, all that ego of mine is broken. I can see that Anjali is so happy when she is with you. I can see it in her eyes. I've never seen Anjali so happy before. Anjali was born after many years into our marriage. Probably that is why we are so possessive... ...and protective over her. Because of that, she went to the US after completing her school. And now she's getting married. And beyond our control, we are panicking. A tension. But then, she made us understand that... ...our daughter isn't leaving us, instead we are gaining a new son. Dad, you may continue this after dinner. Vikram, at least you could have told him. Dinner is ready. Come on. -Come. Come, let's go. How did you like my father's cooking? I knew it, that's why you escaped to US. Was it that bad? -I was kidding. Thanks, Vikram. -Thanks? For what? For spending the whole day with me. The last two days, you seemed really upset. Yet, thanks for spending and having a good time with me. Such a huge list? By the way, Anjali, I read one of your books,... ...Madras Kanavugal. -Finally, you read it. Wait. Is that why you were upset? -No, come on. Fine, I trust you. I really loved the message you conveyed in the book. Usually in the books written by women..... Excuse me? What do you mean by that? Hello, wait. Let me complete. Then you can decide if you want to get angry. Generally when women write about men or men write about women... ...there is always something missing in it. That's what I feel. There is no emphasize on the other side of the story. That's what I feel. I loved the way you portrayed Vijay's character in your story. Not bad. I didn't expect such a detailed insight... ...from you after reading my book. Well, I really liked the message you had conveyed in it. Even if it's true love, when it happens at the wrong time,... ...it will be the right person at the wrong time. That is the reason. Nice perspective, Vikram. Not with respect to that story,... ...in every relationship, timing plays a crucial part. Isn't that Vijay's destiny? The love found at the wrong time... ...is better to be forgotten. Vijay did the same too. Vikram, I believe the characters in my story... ...have a life even though the story ends in the book. So what happens to Vijay and Keerthi's love story? In the war between mind and heart, we only listen to our heart. That's not wrong. But who is to say what the mind thinks is wrong? It's the same case with Vijay. He will find the love that he lost. But that will be a story for another time. Thanks, Anjali. -Are you allowed to thank me now? Thanks for what? Well, I don't even talk to you properly. But you understand all that and me too. Okay. Bye, Anjali. Vikram! -Tell me, Anjali. Okay. Bye. Chitti! I've decided to marry Anjali. No, I don't get it. Didn't you say that you love Preethi? Then why all of a sudden this decision? Answer me. Anjali loves me a lot. When I'm around her, she is so happy as if I'm her whole world. The whole family loves her a lot. I never gave all this a thought. Dude, listen. I'll talk to Preethi. I don't even know if Preethi loves me. She won't even talk to me. Buddy, it's wrong to love one girl and marry another girl. Was that too emotional? Weren't you advising me to marry Anjali? Now, why are you changing your opinion? Who? Me? Dude, you're rushing into this. I shall talk to Preethi. You are my illness as well as the medicine. The heroine is out searching for Kannan. But Kannan is with another woman. Krishna, this is unfair. As I am waiting here with true love... ...but you accept someone else's love. How is this fair? Love is an illusionary trap. I'm trapped in it and I'm struggling. You are everywhere. Don't you know what my heart wants? Or is this another drama you are playing? You accepted Radha's love, then why did you forget it now? Is there anything right and wrong in love? Preethi. -What? Vikram..... -Vikram? Vikram loves you, Preethi. -Are you nuts? No, he truly..... -Look,... ...Vikram doesn't love me. Even if it's true, I can't accept it. Anyway, my answer is no. I've had enough of all this nonsense. Just let me be in peace. -Preethi! You are the question and you are the answer. If love is a sickness,... ...then it has spread all over my heart. And your love is enough to cure it. Once you fall in love, our heart... ...gives no space for hypocrisy. Preethi, please talk to Vikram. -Chitti, I don't love him. Has he ever spoken the truth? He keeps lying for each and everything. It really pisses me off. Please leave. Preethi! If my love is undying,... ...then it will gift me only memories. I live with that pain forever. Time may change, but love is constant. These memories that hurt will never heal, my dear. So, did you talk to Preethi? I'm asking you. -It won't work out. Forget it. What happened? -Both of you love each other. But both of you refuse to accept it. Both of you will not listen to me. I told you many times at the beginning, did you pay heed? Why worry now? Do as you wish. Vikram, have you started giving invitations to your friends? Not yet. We still have time. What's the hurry? How can you be so cool about it? I am so tensed. If we finish all this, then we can relax. Preethi lives around here, right? Let's invite her. Well, Anjali, I'll invite her later. Any problem? -Nothing of that sort. But why now? Being good friends, it won't be nice if we don't invite her. Come, let's go. Hey, Preethi. -Hi. Can we come in? -Yeah, come. Isn't anyone home? Grandpa? -He just stepped out. Okay. We are getting married next month, on the 27th. You, your grandpa and..... -Sanjay. Sanjay. You must come. We have to go now. We have so many invites to give. Vikram hasn't even started inviting his friends. So, we'll leave now. Bye. Vikram, please wait. I'll be back. Preethi, thanks a lot. What you said the other day is right. I'm so lucky to have Vikram in my life. Thank you for everything. Take care. Bye. The purpose of my life is you... You are my lifeline... What would I do without you... You are my life... Even if you break my heart into pieces... I will protect you with all my heart... Even if you hate every inch of me... I will live with your lasting memories... You are present in every music I hear... You are all around me... Even if my pain fades away... My love for you will not fade... Dear,... ...look at me. I can see that you have some problem. I'm not asking you to share it to find a solution. You can make your own decisions. You are mature enough. But seeing your silence gives me a strange feeling. It is during such times... ...you might feel that it would be nice to have your mother. I am here, dear. Share it with me. Tell me. Some issue between you and Vikram. It's quite common in love. Look here, dear. Talk it out. Remember I told you... ...there are no problems that can't be solved if you talk it out. Open your heart and talk. You must talk it out, dear. Krishna, is this fair? Truth...... With someone else..... Another..... Another love is an illusion..... Preethi, what happened? You didn't rehearse the lines, right? For God's sake, practice the lines. We are running out of time. What is the problem, Preethi? It is so evident that your mind isn't here. What's bothering you? I'm unable to forget Vikram, Deepika. But when he said he loved you, you rejected it. What else do you expect? When Vikram is going to marry someone else,... ...how could I accept his proposal? My mind knows it is wrong. But how do I convince my heart? Do you think Vikram still loves you? Then call him. He is not answering my calls, Deepika. Call him now. Do it! Let's make a better plan for that show. I've a plan ready for it. -Vikram, call for you. He's avoiding me, Deepika. I've hurt him really bad. You can discuss all that in person. Try calling him again. We can discuss that. -Vikram, call. No problem. Attend it. -It's okay, I can wait. It's okay. The plan for the 2-3 slot is what worries me. Let's form a team and..... Switched off. Call Chitti. Yes, Preethi? -I want to talk to Vikram. He isn't answering my calls. -I don't get it. What's the use? Both of you are just complicating things for each other. Chitti, I don't have any other..... -He's getting married, Preethi. Forget it. Chitti, I don't want anything else. I just need a word with Vikram, that's it. Please, can you help me? Vikram will be home tomorrow. Go and meet him there. You can still make things better. Meet him in person and tell him everything you want to tell him. Then everything will be fine. Cheer up. Vikram, why did I ever meet you? I don't know why I spent all that time with you. Should I blame it on fate or should I call it destiny? But it was beautiful. All these memories I had with you in this short span... ...is something I'll never forget until my last breath. I cannot come to your wedding and act happy like nothing is wrong. Even if I make it to your wedding,... ...then that would be the last memory of you I'll have. And I don't want that. Both of us meeting again will yield nothing. This is my last gift to you, a shadow of our memories. Vikram, do you need anything else? Are you okay? I know what you're going through the past few days. Can I say something? It's not wrong to fall in love. And it's not wrong being confused. But sometimes you have to take a decision. But what if that decision doesn't lie in our hands? We always have a choice. We all do and even you have said it. Wait. Here. Toss the coin. Now you know what your heart wants. Just do that. Hey, Preethi. How are you? I'm good. What about you? As the marriage date keeps getting closer, I'm getting nervous. What's with the sudden visit? It has been so long since we met last. Yeah. -Are you here to meet Vikram? Well, that.... -What's that? Nothing, it's just your marriage gift. Why give now? Aren't you attending the marriage? No, Anjali. I'm off to Malaysia in two days. I can't make it to the wedding. So I thought I'll meet Vikram and give this to him. Didn't we invite you way before? You could have planned this. South Asian Theatre Festival. This is what we have been rehearsing for all these days. I cannot miss it. Anyway, give this to Vikram. Wait for sometime. He'll be back soon. No, Anjali. I have to go. Anyway, it's good to see you. -Okay. Preethi, take care. That's you and Preethi, right? I thought it was all over between you guys. But no, right? -That's not true, Anjali. Let's call off the wedding, Vikram. Anjali, I wanted to.... -No, Vikram. Ten years after our marriage, what if you think... ...your life would have been better if you had married Preethi? The whole meaning of our marriage would be lost. You don't have to worry about my parents. They will be heartbroken if the wedding is called off. But if they find out we aren't happy after getting married,... ...that pain will kill them. -Anjali, let me explain..... Just go and meet Preethi, Vikram. Anjali, I wanted to tell you... -You know..... I thought I knew everything about love. But love failure... ...and the pain is a part of love, I just realised that. Thanks to you. -Try to understand, Anjali..... I don't want to be a choice, Vikram. No one should be. Everybody says I'm brave, they say I'm bold. But I can feel the pain, Vikram. Go and meet Preethi, Vikram. Go at once. I don't know if I can say this again. Because I too love you. I cannot give you up again. Please leave, Vikram. Just go. Go! Preethi! Why are you here now? To hurt me further? When did I hurt you? -I tried to talk to you. But you took the easy way and avoided me. You didn't even think that it would hurt me. You talk as if only I avoided you. Didn't you avoid me too? Of course. You're getting married. Do you expect me to sit in the front row and bless you? Preethi, I called off my wedding for you. Preethi! Why did you come here after calling off the wedding? Why is this so complicated? I was minding my own business. Why did you come into my life? Why did I have to fall in love with you? And now, why did you have to call off the wedding and come here? Why the hell is this so complicated? I'm sorry, but this is destiny. Every relationship and wedding have issues. I love you. I have always loved you. I want to marry you, Preethi. -No. This won't work out. Even I want this. But do all our dreams come true? This is life. Real life, Vikram. Not all lovers end up together, all dreams do not come true either. But that doesn't stop us from dreaming, Preethi. I'm talking to you. Answer me. Is this how you propose, after getting engaged... ...to someone else? Answer me. If you had said yes when I proposed to you,... ...it wouldn't have come this far. You kept saying no and that you didn't like me. You told me to leave you alone, you kept repeating it. I called you so many times, I left so many messages. Did you even reply once? Every time I came to meet you, you avoided me. In fact, weren't you as confused as I was? Why do you think I'm standing in front of you now? Because I love you. Preethi, you don't have to say it, but I know that you love me. I've spent time with you. I've seen it in your eyes. I've felt it. I love you. How did I picture you in the imaginary story I cooked up? The moment I saw you on the stage, I fell for you. I just fell in love with you,... ..for the first time, the second I laid my eyes on you. Your toast,... ...the way you understood me in the short span of time,... ...I could remember each and every moment with you. That's how much I love you. I love you. I love you so much. The purpose of my life is you... You are my lifeline... What would I do without you... If you keep smiling, I will keep on saying,... ...I love you. -I love you so much. As I said earlier, everybody likes love stories. How it begins and how it ends, some of us do not know. Anjali believed that she knew everything about love. But love can surprise you. There's always something new to learn about love. Preethi believed she could control when she should fall in love. She even thought that if she fell in love,... ...she could deny it if she wanted. We cannot decide when to fall in love. If we do, we risk losing what we have. And Vikram had a checklist when he was looking for love. At times, we have no idea why, how and for what things happen. If you ask me why, I would say because that's love. The purpose of my life is you... You are my lifeline... What would I do without you... You are my lifeline... The purpose of my life is you... You are my lifeline... What would I do without you... You are my lifeline...
