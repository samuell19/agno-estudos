[music playing] Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I come before you pleading the election of a man whose one ambition is to see these 26 states fulfill their destiny as a nation. [crowd cheering] To see the stars and stripes floating from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Over Oregon. You're right, my friend. Over Oregon. [crowd cheering] Oregon, 2000 miles from where we're standing tonight, a land of new hope and a glorious future for the thousands who will settle there and make it a part of these United States of America. [crowd cheering] But the settlement of a vast and uncharted wilderness is not the only issue in this presidential campaign. And it came to me like a flash. I can go [inaudible] take Sonny with me. But Nan, why don't you wait a couple months? Maybe I can go. I'm not going to wait. No grandparents can keep my child from me. Well you can't go out to Oregon alone. Oh, be a good brother and see things my way just once. You seem to forget that mother came out her in a wagon with five children to look after. I guess I can take care of one. Did you ever think what would happen to you if you were caught doing this? Oh, I saw the whole family at a political rally. Sonny must be at the house with mammy Lou. I can have handle her. And there's nothing I can do or say that will change your mind? You can give one thing for me. You can get some of my things packed. I'll be back in half an hour. Miss Wellington, we stealing that child of yours. He's mine. Would has a better right to have him? --[inaudible] what I'm going to get for this night's work. Hush, [inaudible].

Goodbye, papa. Goodbye, Abby. Goodbye, Hetty. [rooster crows] Goodbye, pop. Pa, you hold out for the best price you can get. You sell this farm. There are going to be a lot of people going out to Oregon in the next few years. No, sir. Indiana soil is good enough for me. [inaudible] Whoa. Where you headin' to? Oregon. I guess I just spied [inaudible] in the whole state of Tennessee. Seems like everybody else is a-hankerin' to move. That country out there will have to be settled if we want to hold it with all this trouble over the boundary. Where they leaving from? First wagon train leaves from Independence, Missouri in May. Tank gonna take your sticks to Dave? No, I'm figuring on blacksmithing the lot of them before we leave. We can't do worse than we're doing here. So pa and me, we decided we'd go to Oregon. Well, you got a nice day for it. Yep. Giddy-up! Goodbye, [inaudible]. Goodbye, folks. Steady now. Let her turn. Well, if I ain't missed my count, that makes 50 wagons I worked on in the last two weeks. Hey, wait a minute up there. What's the matter now? You're overloading that wagon. You're apt to bust an axle. Well, looks as if we're going to get away today. Where's that saw mill machinery? Up ahead. What's that they're lugging across the country? I hope the fire engine works when we get it out to Oregon. [laughs] We might throw a match into that load of kerosene and give it a try. [laughter] Noel, they put that stuff in lamps and light a whole house with it. No. Yeah, seen it done. Where's Chris Belmet? Haven't seen him since early this morning. Well you'd better line up these wagons and tell everybody to keep their places. Seen Chris Belmet? He was lining up some freighter. Mother, can I peek out? No, Sonny. You stay there and keep quiet while mother finds out what she has to do. Aw right. Can I do anything for you ma'am? How do I join the wagon train? Why, the register's office is right over yonder. Oh, thank you. [horse neighing] Let's go. [horse neighing] Yourself and four drivers, trading post only. None of you taking up land. That's right. Got all your supplies and equipment? Yes, sir. All approved. Sign here. You claim two sections of land when you get to Oregon. The government gives you that free. There's a lady waiting here. Provision for government financing for the first three years. Thank you. I'm all taken. Sign here, please. [horse neighing] Who owns this outfit? I do. What are you doing with it here? I'm going to Oregon. That thing wouldn't take you to the South Pole with a flat. I'm signed up. Who signed you? She said she had the proper equipment. What would she know about it? I can buy another wagon, or anything else this required. Just tell me what I need. He'll tell you if the government want to be responsible for you. Oh no, nothing like that. We'll have trouble enough without nursing lillywhite women across the Rockies. You've got to let me go. We won't take her. Who is that man? That's Clint Belmet. He's chief scout. He and his partners have contracted to take this part into Oregon. They're responsible. I would buy anything you demand. That's the trouble, miss. You can't get a complete outfit around there. Are you travelling with us? I'm afraid [inaudible] reports with the fur company. I ain't asking anybody to be responsible for me. Mommy, can I come out now? Yes, Sonny. Your kindness seems to have gone for nothing. Are you not going with us? I guess not, with this outfit. Well I can fix you up with a heavy wagon. How? I'll sell you one of mine. Would you? Why, of course. How much would it cost? Oh, we'd talk about that later. Come on. You three partners are really guardian angels of this entire wagon train? Yep, we got the responisibility of the whole outfit. Yes, ma'am. How romantic. William O'Meary, Clinton Belmet, James Burch. That's you, isn't it? Any middle initial, Mr. Burch? Well, not that I recollect of, ma'am. No. You're not married? No. [laughs] Any children? Eh? Oh, of course not. No. CLINT BELMET: You're a squint-eyed old liar. A liar, ay? Want to make anything of it? Well I-- Clint's always making them jokes on me. He's one of my partners. I'm just Abigail Masters. I'm Clint Belmet. Who's that raw-boned old heifer? Why, she's writing the history of our trip, and she's got the three of us in the book already. I'm originally from Indiana. Mmm. Where am I from originally, Bill? I don't know. We found you starving to death in a deserted Indian camp. Should have left you there. I wish we had, too. Where you been keeping yourself? Yeah, we'd have been going away by now. What'a you been doing all morning, ya moon-eyed old calf? Pay no mind to him, ma'am. He's out of his head this way a good part of the time. Come on, now. Let's get this party organized. You help these women hook up. And that's all. How do you know they want you hanging around? You know, I might be of considerable help to you in writing up with that [inaudible] book. Thank you, Mr. Burch. This wagon train is larger and better equipped than we anticipated. That's for the future of our fur trade, Mr. Murdock. There'll be no fur trade if the white man builds his house in Oregon. Of course, this immigration cannot be halted permanently, but it can be discouraged for and a number of years. And now is the time to do it, but we do not want a large [inaudible], you understand that. I understand the white man. When he wants land for which he gives nothing, he'll destroy anything to get it. You speak almost as an Indian. My mother was an Indian. My father I never saw. I don't like white men, but I know they won't turn back for just that. There will be killings. We don't want that. Do anything else to make them turn back. But they must not reach [inaudible] the river. They won't if I handle it my way.

Give me that slingshot. Oh, he can't hurt them chickens. But he shouldn't be doing it. [chickens clucking] Well, I know what happened to that one, anyway. Hand it over, young man. Have I got to? Well, then I won't tell you the secret. What secret? Well, it's a very good secret. What is it? Come over here. Clint's gone. Where did he go? He told me, but I forgot. He told me just to tell you-- What? [inaudible] Oh, Sonny. What did he tell you? Remember. Well, he'll be back in four or five days and he don't have to tell you where he's been, because I [inaudible]. [music playing] Tell them to be ready when half the wagons have crossed the river. Then pocket them. Do you understand? Tell them they'll be along in six or seven days. [music playing] How long they been hitting it up like this? Most a week now.

If you can't control you men folks, how do you think I'm going to? Well, a bottle of whiskey'll cost you a barrel of flour Why, that's the same as robbing a man. Suits me, brother. You can take it or leave it. Well, all right. Carrie, a bottle of the best. Was he right? Yes, it's Murdock. And we got to move out of here right now. In all this mud?

All right, the women can drive. Come on, let's throw the men in the wagon. [inaudible] That's enough of you. Let go of my arm. The train's pulling out. Belmet's given us orders. Let him go.

Agreed? [music playing] They'll be here in a few minutes, folks. Who are they, [inaudible]? A couple of agents to take you off our hands. We've landed you in Oregon and we're done. Thank goodness we can stay in one place for a spell. You'll have to file on your claims in the same order that you signed up at the independence. Then you'll have 30 days to file under two sections. [scoffs] Won't take me any 30 days. We can't wait any longer, Abby. We got to take up a homestead. I'm willing to marry you, Jim Burch. But you've got to write to my father in Indiana, ask for my hand. But it takes a letter a year to get there and back. I can't help that. It's proper. Here. But Abby, I can't write.
