There she is... Late as usual. At least I'm consistent. To me familia. To unity. To power and success baby. Sam how come every time James and I say one thing you always have to say two? You know he's never been one to play by the rules. Man Y'all say it like it's a bad thing. I got my way of doing things and y'all got y'all way of doing y'alls. Except your ways have been landing you in a lot of trouble lately... Yeah, only sometimes. No but for real though. that situation from a few months ago, I appreciate you getting me out of it like I really mean it. You know we got you fam! Since the fourth grade. Yeah I love y'all. I love y'all. Finding reliable trustworthy people... it's not an easy thing. I hear that. Ok you don't need to butter us up you know we love you anyways. mm-hmm but um speaking of family... When are you two going to settle down and start your own family? You know... get out this crazy game? Look before we have any bad kids running around I want to enjoy Disney World all by myself. Disney World that's random Language one, two what does every person do after they've accomplished something great they go to Disney World and I for one have never been. Well it seems like y'all got it all figured out huh... But no seriously, when are y'all gonna throw in the towel? People gonna respect y'all regardless. We have a lot of work to do and you of all people know we don't do this for the respect we do it for the power. What's the difference? When one mistakes powerful respect, they fall under the illusion that people like them and then when those same people stop liking them or respecting them, they stop listening. When you have power, You could make somebody do whatever you want them to do. Empires always fall. Power's always getting overthrow. Power doesn't change, the people in it do. If someone has true power you have an unlimited amount of resources. People will turn against their own family to comply with that institution. Even go against their own beliefs. You can keep your respect. So Londyn, what reason are you in the game with James for? Is it for the money, or is it for the power? hmm neither... I just love him and I love what we do... but the power definitely turns me on. wait keep that gross to a minimum. Language! Hey look so it's been real but I gotta go I'll link up with y'all later and besides we gotta lay out the ground rules for that job I was telling you about. Where are you going? Damn, can I just do me? Dang Plus I'm sick of y'all staring at each other all sexual. Bye Sam... Be safe brother. Where's he been rushing off to lately? I don't know but he keeps ditching us at random times. It's sad... He's one of the only actual friends that we have. What about the hundreds of people that were around on a daily basis? They just work for us or call us to set some record straight. He's right though, we gotta start thinking about hanging this thing up. I mean, I kind of want the American dream. Big house, couple kids, white picket fence... Do you really think people like us could have a normal life? I mean we're not too popular with the local police department. I don't see why not. Speaking of normal, most normal people who still have their parents actually talk to them. Londyn not now please... I'm just saying she's gonna be part of our lives sooner or later. Let's just have dinner with her. You don't know what this woman has done and you don't know what she's capable of doing. I know what you weren't capable of doing. Besides I'm sure you're nothing like her. CFO... Vigilante... not exactly the most scholarly. Just because she never missed a PTA meeting does not make her a mother. Yeah well it's a start. Like I said let's just have dinner please. See what I got to deal with man. That's the way it goes. See you next time. So which one of you wants to explain to me why you're beating this kid up? because he's a little punk. Right... How exactly? he just is. That's not a reason. You and James beat up butt holes all the time. We won't do it again Ms. London, we swear. Good. Isn't it 2:00 on a Wednesday... Shouldn't you be in school? We got early release. You need to find something more constructive to do other than bullying. There's always gonna be another bully bigger and badder than you. I'm that bully. Alright we got it can go now? I know your mom taught you manners... Can we go now please? You ok kid? Whats your name? Marvin. We gotta go... You're late. You're lucky... Lucky I decided to come and do business with you. Yo this guy's serious? Who do you think you are? I had about enough of this. Who's in charge? I am. That's where you're wrong. I'm in charge. Look, don't get it twisted. The only reason we don't kill you where you stand it's because we know you have friends in high places. Now if it wasn't for London and James you'd be a certified nobody. Now we at least respect them... We just tolerate you. No, you don't respect them, you fear them. You think London and James are the only heavy hitters I got backing at me?! I work for Black Widow! He said he works for black widow. Since when did James in London join forces with Black Widow? That's the beauty of it? They don't. Just so happens I got two friends that run a city and another who runs everything else so I guess by default, I run everything. Yo something about all this doesn't feel right. What do you know about Black Widow? I Know there's only one person in this world that's crazier than James. Has either one of you ever seen her? What kind of question is that? No one ever has. I have! So I guess I'm not exactly a nobody like you. Hey look I suggest we conclude business soon. I wouldn't want to keep any of my friends waiting. This sketchy-ass... This guy is super sketchy. It better all be there too... light-skinned ass... We out bro. Come on man. Nice doing business with you. How did it go. Smooth. I had to flex my weight a little bit but I think them got the message. That's a good boy. So we have these peasants on lock now. You know I'd really really hate to have to stoop to this level at this point in my life but what can I say... Pays very well nowadays. Thank you. What are you thanking me for? This is business And this... is your payment. You know you could have all the riches in the world but it still doesn't guarantee happiness. I don't think a follow. have another engagement nothing to concern yourself with but you did good very good my love. yes ma'am Tye stop. Why do you always make me do this to you? All we have to do is obey your man. You're just hard headed. There you go... whenever somebody puts you in your place then you want to play the victim. Do you know what you would be without me? I asked you a question, answer me! Nothing, you would be nothing without me. I will not do this... It's over you hear me!? I don't want to be with you anymore. You need help! Tell me you love me! No... Say no again! No... Who you are coming in my house like this? You just gonna walk up in my house like this? Did you give them my address? Did you tell them to come? You know what, Y'all about to be dead... Go wait outside with London. Where you going? I didn't tell you you could go anywhere! Who are you? My name is James... The James?... l]Lsten man I don't want no trouble man. I didn't know. You know how women get man, sometimes you got to put them in their place. People that know me know I'm a man of principle. If you disrespect any of my friends I give everybody a chance to right their wrongs before I kill everything that they love. If it's genuine I may even forgive them. Hey girl you know.... Lucky for you she's not my friend. She's my sister... Hey man I don't know anything... Does it make you feel tough beating her like that? You feel tough right now?... I don't ever repeat myself, answer me! No, I don't feel tough.Yeah you do. Come on man, you can tell me the truth. I promise you I won't get mad. Makes you feel good doesn't it? No. She can... she can go. She don't answer to you. You have no authority over her life. You don't even control your own life right now, I do. Look over at her tell her you're sorry. I'm sorry. For what? For hitting you... What else? and calling you out your name. And... I don't know. What? I don't know... What about her money you've been taking for the last few months? You Snitch B*! Language! Now why would a guy with a nice condo, nice car outside, nice clothes, be taking money from a woman who works for an honest living? hmm oh because you're all washed up and a one-hit wonder. You scared to talk now? No... Speak up! She agreed to it! What, you forced me to! That sounds more like the truth. You want me to tell you why I think you beat her, take her money, strip her of her dignity, because having someone need you is the only thing that gets you off. So of course this isn't the first time you've done this. See we do our research Tyree Chambers. Only child, mother's name is Cher, father's name is Henry. Those two girls... You stripped everything from them. And one of them took her own life because of it. That was probably the only option that you gave to escape your sorry little butt. You don't know nothing about me. See that whole yelling thing just makes you even weaker. I do have to say, though this is a nice place. Place like this has to have a safe in it. it's upstairs in the master bedroom on the right side of the wall combo is three four to five eight seven. You I told you to watch your language! There's a lot of money to have in your house at one time. Someone could steal it. Wait where's she going? Where are you going? Don't worry about her. I think we're done here. They won't always be around here to protect you. I'm gonna get every dime of my money back! You're gonna pay for all of this! I'm gonna see to it! I doubt it... I didn't know you smoked... I don't, these things could kill you. What if someone comes looking for us? Ma'am, am I interrupting something? What do you need? We have a deal in 40 minutes we're trying to see like what else you got planned for me? That's your problem. How would you focus on one thing and then I'll let you know. Yes ma'am. Oh and Sam is gonna be tagging along with you on this job.Wait what? Do I need to repeat myself? No I just thought I was the one running things? That's your problem. You think too much! Brock you should be honored that you're even still working for me after that little stunt you pulled. Man I got twice as much experience as this man. I put in twice as much work and you gonna rank this ** higher than me?! Come on young!... Knowledge hmm is your safety even on your gun? Boy have you even shot a gun in your life bruh? That's enough! I said that's enough! I'm just playing with him. You ever held a gun in your life? There's multiple ways to hold a gun... Hmm it's got some weight to it. This is nice! You know you could always hold it like this. Or you could do it ex-military style, hold it like this. And if you're feeling real thuggy, like this. But we all know that's not safe right. Or my personal favorite, Black Widow Style. See the difference between you and I is I keep my safety off. I stay ready. Shoot to kill, that's the goal. Now if I hear anything and I mean anything about you trying to flex on these jobs, I'm not gonna shoot you black widow style. I'll gut you myself. Now who is in charge when you go out on these missions? Sam. And who owns you? You... Now what's my name? Black Widow... What's my name? Black W.. WHAT'S MY NAME? BLACK WIDOW!!! Mmm, I like that. Now put the safety before you blow your nuts off. Get the job done Let's go boy... Well today started out pretty normal. Yeah all the neighbors stories match. Heard an explosion, two or three of them ran to the window, looked out. That's when they saw their neighbor Tyree Chambers' house up in flames. Or what's left of it. Yeah well they were stuck in amazement one of the neighbors pretty smart actually went outside to see if anybody was still around and that's when she noticed a car driving down the street... Just couldn't make out who was in it but she definitely knows there was more than one person in it. Well early forensics ruled out terrorism. Said it was a gas leak. Maybe... Why would a car be driving away with a house blowing up in its rear view mirror? Well most people are gonna be scared for their life. I mean you hear an explosion, you're not gonna stick around and wait to see what happens next. I mean maybe they were fleeing for safety. What do we know about Tyree Chambers? Well he was a local artist with one song that skyrocketed him to success and money. We know that over the past four years, he's been arrested twice and locked up. One was for armed robbery and the other one was for domestic offense. There have been sporadic calls made by women. Three women in fact, who are claiming domestic abuse. We asked him to come in for questioning. They refused and got silent. Now if you ask me my personal opinion, I feel like the person who did this they were doing our job for us. Doesn't seem like this guy was too much of a victim after all. Do you have anything on who he's been seeing lately? Is he dating anybody? We don't have any information on the relationship all we have is the record of phone calls. What was the last call made to the local authorities over a month ago and who made the call? I believe her name was Lisa Hunter. Lisa Hunter? Yeah, do you know her? That is sister of James Hunter. You mean of the infamous Londyn and James? Come on Evans look around you, He practically left a calling card. I mean he does these things just to send a message. Well who do you think this message was for? Well I would assume it was for the victim Tyree Chambers but at the same time probably anyone who comes in contact with her to let them know that no one will ever lay a hand on her ever again. I mean well we can't bring them in as a suspect at this point we have nothing on him or London and they're nearly impossible to track down. They always seem to be one step ahead of us. So maybe we need to bait them, we can outsmart them, and draw them in to us. How do you suppose we do that? Well they have plenty of resources. Why don't we tap into one and see what kind of information we can get on them. Let's get started. The prodigal son returns. How long has it been? Not long enough. Oh you don't mean that. This is a really nice place you have here Mama P. Thank you... Heard a lot about you. Not from my son of course. The streets. Hoping they were good things. Ehh... Well I suppose it was your little friend that made you come here tonight. No one could make me do anything. You of all people should know that. I don't mean to upset you. I'm just saying that it was her little idea to have this get-together. I know you guys have been distant for some time. I don't know why but I know that it's never too late to start over. Plus, I selfishly wanted to see the famous Mama P. The streets talk both ways, What she's done can't be undone. You wanna tell her? Let me rephrase what my son is trying to say. We just clashed a little bit about the way I've raised him. Raised me, that's what they call child abuse now? Baby look... ENOUGH of this baby stuff! Save the theatrics for somebody that cares. I did what I had to do. I was a single mother. Yeah in between husbands. You beat me multiple times a day. Said it would making me strong. Make me humble... Prepare me for the pain of this world. You're still alive aren't you? Is that also why used to look at me the way you did? Every time you got angry every time you got bored, you will make me pay. I don't know why you're bringing this up. The past is the past... I was 11! That's not who I am anymore. You don't think I relive every day? What I went through... What I put us through... You ain't the only person that's seen some You don't know what it's like to be community property... For family friends. You don't know what it's like to be abandoned. You don't know what it's like to be abused. You call this abuse? So that gave you the right to do what you did to me? That's why pops left you. That's why he didn't come back hmm You still believe in Santa Clause don't you. How cute... Your father was a fool! That's why he's dead. Told him one too many times not to put his hands on me. What!? He made me feel like I was nothing. Don't act what you don't remember when he used to beat the out of me. You beat me in front of him too, what's the difference? What do you want to say James? What do you want from me? I'm not perfect by no means, but you're still my son and you're still my responsibility. That's sweet MA. Some things are unforgivable. Boy you lost your... You and I will never see eye to eye. Londyn got the answers she was looking for. I confirmed all the feelings that I had for you since I was a kid. You're psychotic, you're selfish, and you're unstable. I'm gonna say this once and I'm gonna make it clear. I don't want to see you again. Mother or not, I will make you wish you never had me. A lot of things have changed Ma. I'm not that scared little boy anymore. I need you to understand something. I will kill you if I have to. Oh honey, you don't think I know who you are? What you've become... I see everything. I know everything. That little girl of yours. I hear how the streets are talking. Got everybody scared. That's cute. But it ain't me. It ain't Mama P. See I heard about the cries for justice and the killing sprees.I know all. I see all. I am all. Just like I see that with the hand on her gun. You're in my house. You can't play with me like that. You can't threaten me like that baby. You can't outsmart me. You can't leave me. You won't leave me. I'm always gonna love you. I'm a changed woman. I've changed, I have. You're crazy and I need you to keep your distance. Londyn Let's go. James! Boy you better walk out my * house... Boy! James! I am your mother! You came from me! Like a mother like son. hmm I'm the Queen P. That didn't go so well did it? He'll be back. I did not realize how crazy your mother actually is. I just wanted you to see firsthand why I cut her out of our lives. Yeah well let it stay that way. She can't hurt you anymore. I got you. Are we seriously watching the news? What is this 1963? Old Man... "The individual at the hospital is actually a minor so his name will not be released"Kid's are getting caught up younger and younger these days. "and Samuel Dodson 24 have all lost their lives in this senseless string of violence making this the worst singular incident of murders since 1988 in the Silver Spring area. We'll keep you up to date as the situation unfolds we'll be back with more..." Did she just say who I think she said? Calm down, everything's fine. I'll just call him. The name is common. Hey bro we need you to call us as soon as you get this. Just want to confirm that somethings not true. So just call us back and let us know where you are. Call him again... Went straight to voicemail. Turn that up. "The authorities are working to find the shooter as quickly as possible and identify the motive for this tragedy." James... That's his picture... No no no no.... We're gonna find out and did this... And we're going to make them pay... For Sam. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry too. You and James have been friends with my son ever since you guys were kids. Yeah he was a good man. Always knew what to say to make us laugh... Is James okay? This hit all of us pretty hard but it seems to be affecting him the most. They were brothers. It wasn't a moment we shared without him talking about you two! You guys were good to him. Watching you all grow up... I just can't believe they took my baby from me. We thank you for coming out, thank you both. You don't need to thank us sir. Sam was our best friend an army couldn't keep us away. If there's anything that either of you ever need, we're only a call away. I know what you and James are into. What do you mean? I'm not blind to what's going on. You two have quite the reputation. I know you two have done some terrible things. Made friends with some terrible people.... Ma'am we had nothing to do... If you really want to help us, find the person who killed my son and make him pay! My son didn't deserve to die...Not like that. so you find them! My bad bruh. Hey guys I worked with your son. Yeah yeah I'm so so sorry for your loss. It's a loss to all of us you know... Huge loss... Yeah he was a good kid. He's gonna be remembered by many. He was loved by many. Well, thank you for coming out. Oh of course, I had to you know. I I wish he was still here. You know we all have our time. The Lord works in mysterious ways. Yes. He's merciful... He'll find some peace. Thank you Have a good one. Thank you. I want answers. Then we'll do it together. I have a lead to start us on our warpath. I don't want them to pay... I want them to burn! Then we'll do what we do best. We owe Sam that much. It's who we are. Always. Always. Evans you got the case number on the nuke dots investigation yes one nine three seven five. Man these last couple days have been crazy let me tell you... This got hunter all over it. I don't follow you. I mean Sam and James were like family. Everyone knows that. James would never let anything happen to him. Neither would Londyn. Look Sam hanging with criminals is what got him killed, I guarantee it. But he knew what he was getting into. We have nothing, I mean let's just wait and see what the lab comes back with. Let's not jump to conclusions. Besides, just because Sam had dangerous friends doesn't mean that his record wasn't squeaky-clean. Look when you got friends in low places, they'll do all the dirty work for you. We need to just wait and see what forensics comes back with. I mean look, this might not be my place to say this but you have to control your fascination with James and that woman. Focus on the case at hand. You think things are tough enough now? What's gonna happen when they retaliate? It's only a matter of time. You said it yourself. We need to do our job and to punish those who have clearly done wrong. It's our job to keep them from doing wrong. We're not just a cleanup crew. I suggest you get your head in the game stop making excuses for the scum buckets so we can do our job! You're such a hypocrite! I've never had a problem doing my job. We just do it differently. I don't let my emotions or personal vendettas get in the way of my judgment detective gamble. Evans... What's the problem? The bullet casings and cell phone found on the Dodson victim's body are missing... What do you mean missing? This never happens but we believe the evidence was stolen from the facility within the last hour or so. Nobody knows anything. *!!! Okay... We both know this isn't good but I thought I'd call and let you know. What now? The evidence went missing and forensics is scrambling to see what happened. What 's your book tell you to do now? What are your emotions telling you? They're telling you that you need to go back to the academy. What do you have for us? I didn't have time to unlock it. You guys were close so maybe you can figure out the password. How did you get this? Let's just say you have your secrets, I have mine. Lamont! I swiped it from forensics. You always find a way to outdo yourself. You sure nobody saw you? Would I be here if there was? This one is on the house... For Sam. What else you got? Well, along with his phone I managed to get my hand on the shell casings. Did you ru them for prints? We ran them. No prints. But I did found a powder substance usually found on rubber gloves so I decide to check out crime scene myself. Less than 150 yards from Sam's body, I found the gun.I had my person run it. The gun and the casings were a match. But what really threw me off... The shooter left his prints on a gun but not the casings... Why would you go through the trouble of putting gloves on to load the gun but then not use gloves to shoot it? Yeah why would you kill somebody and leave the gun at the crime scene? Someone wants us to find out. Whose prints are they? Running them now. I'll have something for you in a couple hours. What about you Mike? I don't know man. There's something about this that just seems a little off. Sam made it out. Had a good job. He was making a name for herself outside of the game but all the facts point to him doing some type of underhanded . Language! Look, he would have told us. What if he couldn't? What if whoever he was working for didn't want him talking? Mike that's crazy. Why wouldn't he tell us? We could have protected him. When I put out the signal, I got a message back saying that a guy matching Sam's description was making huge transactions between different companies. Look they don't know the type of deals, hell they didn't even know it was him until he popped up on the news this morning. Look, I think y'all may need help from a higher authority. Especially one that can get you out of this that's about to come your way. Have you been smoking? You know I don't do cops. He doesn't do cops. Look, every cop in this state wants us behind bars. I get that. There may be one detective that may hear you out. Let's hope we never have to pull this card. I think we're done here. Be easy bruh, I'm serious. I don't want to wake up the next morning and y'all done killed everybody in the whole damn town... Aw Aww AWW Dang it's encrypted. We literally have three tries before everything on this phone is fried. Try Ravens. Make that two tries. What about his birthday... Make that one. You know what, how about I pick this time? Be my guest. That prankster. I bet it's something dumb like password. Really you actually think...Got It! I'm not seeing anything in here specific. Just a bunch of code words but it looks like he was working for someone named Black Widow. Haven't we had a few run-ins with some of her goons. Never thought it was a big deal. They always stay out of our territory... I never thought it was an issue either. Wait I've seen this before... Seen what? This logo. Where have I seen it before... What... Londyn What!? What have you got for me Lamont? Yeah, I think I have an idea already. I'll call you later. James, how many husbands has your mom had? Three-ish. One was a deadbeat, ran off after like six months. Well we know what happened to your dad. What happened to Lisa's? Carbon monoxide, suicide in the garage. He left a note and everything. I was like 16 years old. And why are black widows called such? Honestly I'm mad at both of us for not seeing it. It's the perfect cover. She's freaking Mama P! Parent of the year. Moved around international trade deals so she could make it to your football games. Got you into the best schools. Gave you the best chance to not get into the game like she did. But in the end you can't run from genetics. Like mother like son... How dare you! You of all people know how much I hate my mother. If she even qualifies as such... You heard it from her mouth, she killed my father. So what are you gonna do about it? We said we're gonna get whoever did this and make them pay! Now we know who to send the invoice to. This isn't just another job Londyn! She's blood. You said if you have to! I don't think I can do this... ! Then what do you suggest we do? We could expose her. Get her to claim responsibility for the shootout at the warehouse. You're right she needs to pay I just don't think I can do that I don't think I'm ready to kill her. We'll try it your way but please know if anything goes south, I will protect you and me at any cost. We can confronted tonight at Elite Society. Everybody knows it's owned by Black Widow. And if that doesn't work, we're doing it my way. It will work I think I already got a plan. As much as I don't like it, it's the best way to prevent shots from being fire. hmm Sounds like a boring night indeed... Take a seat over there we need to talk. I know who you are. I don't do cops. I don't trust them. Hell, I don't even want to be here right now but I need something from you. We don't do business with criminals like you. You can pretend to be like the rest of them but you're not. You're different. You can at least see the corruption that's going on in your department... No? Maybe not but I assure you it's there. But you're better than all of them. You're strictly by the book. What do you want from me? Something big is going down in two days. Be at this location at 11 p.m. Turn your siren, wait 30 seconds, get out your car, draw your gun, a wait for whoever walks out the door. Take them down to the station, that's it. You're gonna have to kill me here cuz I'll never get tied up with a man like you. A man like me? You still think I'm the bad guy. That locket around your neck, he meant a lot to you didn't he? Excuse me? Your brother meant a lot to you. You carry him around with you everywhere you go. Nobody should have to deal with that. You were only in high school when it happened. How do you know about this? I do a lot of research on my enemies. Make's them easier to kill. Lucky for you, you're not my enemy. I can't say the same for your partner Gamble. Now your brother was likely killed by a crooked cop then the case was dropped leaving you no chance to catch the perp. You don't find that strange? You don't know what you're talking about. Oh yes y... NO YOU DON'T! Look if I wanted to kill you, you'd already be dead. I'm not your enemy tonight. Stop talking! Gamble killed your brother. He's been right under your nose this entire time and you've been too busy playing by the book! WAKE UP! You're a liar. My brother was killed in Chicago years before I moved here. Conveniently, your partner hasn't always been local. You do know he transferred two months after your brother was killed. He even got a promotion. That doesn't sound a little strange to you? What it sounds like to me, either he has some pull or he's got something over somebody's head. What are you talking about? I would have know if Gamble was transferred. It wasn't in the paperwork. Do you trust your chief? Yes. Call her. If she's as good a person as you are, she'll tell you the truth. Hey Evans, what do you need? Um Chief... I'm sorry to bother you right now. I know you're going over the paperwork from the Johnson case from this morning. You know I always have time for my up-and-coming detective. You okay? I have a question about Gamble. Was he transferred from another location back before I got here? Yeah, he came here from Chicago many years ago. How did you know that? Hello?... Evans are you there? Yeah I just... A friend just walked in. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Get some rest. You sound drained. Will do. Please leave. You have a decision to make. Please! All you got to do to show up at this location and arrest whoever walks out the door. Look you'll probably be a hero and get a promotion. I can't just arrest whoever I want. We have protocols. You and I both know y'all be having some loopholes... Figure it out! Do we have a deal? I know you're a good person. I also know you think about your brother every day so whatever you decide to do with Gamble, I'll cover for you. That's what me and Londyn do. Cover the innocent and clear the good. I'll make sure your name is clear too. Oh, where do you think you're going big fella. We need to see Black Widow. Oh I'm sorry bruh but that ain't happening. And uh Shorty over here Ain;t even tall enough to ride the rides so no admission bruh. Y'all need to leave. We can't do that. I wasn't asking, I'm telling. It's time to go! Nah... James darling, it's good to see you again. We're here to talk about Sam. Leave us. Leave! Are you sure? Leave us now! I'm good. Baby boy... Why did you kill Sam? I didn't kill Sam.Then how did he get in the ground? Word on the street, it was a setup to knock out a few key players. I also found out he was working for somebody named Black Widow, that happens to be you. That's mother to you. Besides, who told you that? A little hospitalized birdie. Nobody asked you ! You calm down, you don't ever talk to my woman like that again. Let me rephrase. Why did you have Sam killed? I did not have Sam killed. The truth of the matter is Sam was on my payroll. He worked for me. The deal was he'd get through college, earn his degree, and then become my closer. That was the deal. I gave him a little job so he could put money in his pocket. Sam was good. He was a good talker. He closed my deals. He was my liaison when I couldn't meet with folks, he did. He would even take my crew out just to make sure everybody was on point and report back to me. That's the truth. That's what Sam was to me. I would never... Do you hear me? I would never let anything happen to him. Not Sam. I loved him... So if not you, then who? I don't know... I don't know. I keep going over in my mind about everything about that last deal. Everything was in place. Brock was... Brock was supposed to line everything up like I...Where is he? I don't know. I don't know. I actually been texting him and I've been calling him and he hasn't been answering my calls. I haven't seen him in days. I'm willing to bet he's behind this. We're going to go handle that. He may also be your pet, but don't be mad when I put him down. You might just earn my respect with that. So what about our plan? Got some of my old tac-team guys I can call, figure something out. What's about to take place outside, don't try to interfere. We got this. You better have a plan son. I love you. You better make it back you hear me? James... James! We're going to make this right ok? Hey, Remember that favor you owe me? Time to cash it in. Yo... We just got word that James and his girl got booked. You know how long the cops been trying to take them down? That means they aren't a threat to you anymore big homie. Your lucky boss. Lucky? You think I'm lucky? Yeah man I'm just saying those two could be a little scary and unpredictable.. Do I look scared! When have I ever allowed fear in my life. Never, I'm just saying.. Alright then. Are you scared? hmm? Are you scared? Naw... Alright. Don't you ever met your fear of my presence again! Do I make myself clear? Yeah boss... I didn't mean it like that. He didn't mean it like that y'all. Naw man...Aye y'all he didn't mean it like that. I understand Bruh you good... I understand that fear is a sign of weakness so you implying that I'm scared is implying that I'm weak and I'm not weak! Does anyone else think that I'm scared?! Exactly! I've been sitting on the sidelines! Watching and waiting. been with Black Widow for 11 years and that put that gun to my head! All because of her little choir boy Sam? Oh y'all gonna start putting respect to my name. Y'all gonna start putting some respect on my name! I've been in this game since I was 17 years old. I'm a vet this game. You all work for me! Does anyone disagree? As many times as I've dreamt of this day, I never thought it would go down like this. I mean you and your little girlfriend got bust on the same day. That's incredible! And Evans, she's gonna get a medal for this right? I mean you can sit there and look at me that smirk on your face all you want boy, but your time's up. You lost. What did he do to you? This is not who we are... Whoa, hands Up! Get on your knees. No, leave her. When Evans gets done with your so-called soul mate, you're gonna be going to jail for a very very long time. What's gonna happen to you? I'm sorry, I don't follow. Besides not getting any recognition for this whole lock-up situation, don't you think you deserve a little bit of punishment for the things you've done in your past? Whatever they may be... That's the problem with you people, you may think you're good with your words and everything, but you all can't keep yourselves out of trouble. I can't wait for them to lock your black ass up for a long time. It'a just a matter of time. It's almost time. We're not going anywhere... Well we're about to leave here in a few minutes but we're not going to jail. Don't be so certain. People like you are so fascinating. Raised to think a certain way, I see you stuck with that didn't you? You see your way of thinking is so archaic. So blinded by hate, you can't even see when you've already lost. Instead of worrying about my people, you should worry about yourself. Do you know what you just did? Yeah, saved your life. Man, ain't you heard of calling first? You know you're the only one to hold a gun on me and still breathing right? Aye man look, it's 12 o'clock midnight, I hear knock on my door. I ain't got no friends, but I do got family. What's going on cuz? J? What's goin on man? Yeah look ya'll must be up to something if you are here this time of night. Y'all get on in here man. So ya'll want a drink. No, thats...Yeah, I'll have a double of whatever you have. Yeah, same here. So what y'all need? We need a favor. Favor? Look, you know you ain't gotta ask cuz. Bring it back in one piece and we Gucci. We're not here for the usual. We need something heavy. Your finest. Sounds like y'all trying to start a war. Follow me. All right, pack heavy. Brock may not know we're coming but he probably has an army behind him like the coward he is. Speaking of army, we're almost done with this stuff babe. Done with what? Done with all of this. I'm trying to think of a future where we're not looking over our shoulder constantly. Yeah you're right. As much as I love my guns, I'm kind of ready to hang it all up. The American Dream... House... Maybe a couple of kids. Even a dog... White picket fence. Yeah, after everything we've been through with Sam I'm just ready for Disney World like every other retiree and Super Bowl champ on the planet. Look, we're gonna get you those little corny Mickey Mouse ears eventually. What happens if one of them gets away? You know they're gonna come for us. I was hoping we wouldn't have to use this cuz it's risky. We're about to one up Nick Fury. Same stuff that he used to slow his heartbeat to three beats per minute, we'll use as well. After we blow Brock to kingdom come, we'll stick ourselves. The ambulances will arrive and pronounced dead on the scene. My morgue guy will take us somewhere where we can sleep for about eight hours and wake up safely. Then we can ride off into the sunset and anybody loyal to Black Widow, Gamble, or Brock will be none the wiser. Sounds like the best sleep we've had in a while. Very much needed. It actually sounds like that might work though. It better. Look Londyn, we're about to get into the biggest gun fight we've ever been in. I need some kind of insurance that you're gonna come back to me in one piece. I can't come back to you if I'm already beside you. And you always have been, but I need to know that you always will. Look through all life's tragedies, there's always been this happiness. It's kind of hard to explain. I'm not even gonna try but I do know that you're their happiness. You've been my crazy, beautiful, strong, ride or die for over 20 years now. We've been through a lot. Especially since... Since they took Sam from us. And I know he can't be here to share this moment with us physically, but I do know he's here in spirit... Especially since he helped me pick this out a few weeks ago. James! I don't know what's on the other side of tomorrow. I just know I want you in all of my tomorrows. However many of those we have left... Will you marry me? Yes! I can't imagine this life without you. It's who we are. Always. Always. Hey go check this out man move! You out of bullets already huh? I don't need them to kill you man. Say less. All that stuff you was talking huh! Yeah, this is my city. Then after I'm done with you, I'ma kill your mother! The city's mine! Get off me... Get Up. wait James I want to know why. We already know why. I want him to say it. Why did you kill Sam? Because that little ... Call him outside of his name one more time! Now tell me why. Because he was weak. What's going on sketchy Sam? You on time today huh? Come on man y'all ready to do business or what? Your gorillas look ready so I guess we're ready to. Yo! I thought we were here to do business... That's why. He clearly had more King material than you. How dare you show up to his funeral. How dare you talk to his parents. Anybody that does that ain't even worth the ground they walk on. Man what are you talking about? That man was soft! He wasn't no King! I was next in line! This isn't the playground! Nobody's gonna take turns or share. You know you talk about wanting to be king so much. That little stubble, it's not very kingly of you. How about we give you a nice clean shave. Sam was our family. Look at me! You took him from us. Normally I'm a man that gives second chances. But that hasn't really been a trend lately. Do you think you deserve a second chance? You probably ain't even gonna survive the night... Time to burn! What are you some kind of Christian man hmm? Do you think goddess forgive me for my sins? You can ask her yourself. This is my favorite shirt too... Don't do this to me.It's just a flesh wound. James I'll live. Time to shoot up. Are you sure about this? Pretty sure. Let them think they got Bonnie and Clyde. No they got Londyn & James. Well it looks like we'll be having a small ceremony. What about your people back home that helped us out? I don't want anyone knowing where we are. Small ceremony it is. I'm actually warming up to the whole idea of escorting my mom down the aisle. Aww, you guys are mending. If you want to call it that. now I think Lisa being the maid of honor and having your mom is just gonna be great. Also, I'm liking the idea of purple for our wedding colors. Purple? Barney gonna be there too? Not that kind of purple. Like a lilac or a lavender. Purple is the color of royalty... James? James!!! It's over hunter, you lost. It ends here for you and your girlfriend. For good this time. James! James, look at me. It's going to be okay all right... It's okay... you're gonna be fine. James! James look at me! It's going to be okay. I'm gonna find some help. It's okay... I love you. It's who we are. Always... James! JAMES!! James... No... Please don't leave me... Don't do this to me... Please... I can't do this without you. Please. I have a package for Londyn Barnes. I prefer Hunter. Ok... Thanks. London these last few days have made me realize that you're the only thing that's ever mattered to me and I want to give you the world because of that. I know we talked about retiring in the future but now's a better time than ever We have everything we need to live comfortably. Then maybe one day, pass to our children. Until then, there are a lot of things in your life that you haven't had a chance to do so now is the time. This is my early engagement gift to you. Here's to new beginnings. You are forever my queen. Love... James. Oh ma'am we have an issue. Detective gamble pulled through. He's in recovery. I know he killed your son. We're gonna make him pay. My child is dead... Dead! Dead!!! My child is dead and that's the best y'all can bring me... He's in recovery!... James... We're gonna make it burn! Burn!
