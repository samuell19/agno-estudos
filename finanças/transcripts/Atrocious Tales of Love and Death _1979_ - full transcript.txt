We see each other every moment, but this doesn't make you happy. How can I see you at night, if I can't have a picture? So I put my finger on this camera and go "click". And I rush to have it printed. You want your picture taken? Have your picture taken, my beauty. I focus the camera and take a picture of you. Let me photograph you. Let me photograph you. Ladies and gentlemen, the famous maestro Raffaele Capece will now play a classic piece by himself. Do you prefer Bach or Vivaldi? We prefer being left alone. - Here. - Thank you. - 10.000, Gennarino. - I'll take that. It's what I gave you this morning. - Me? - Your father borrowed it. I have two troubles in my life. Polio and my father. You can recover from polio, but as for my father... Giardino, the gambler, called me. - You must go to him tonight. - The third trouble has arrived! Let him in! - Meatball! - Do you have 9? - Hurry! - 79, marvel! 15, 79 and 44. I did 3 in a row! What the hell are you saying? 44 hasn't come out yet! - What is it? - Here it is. 44. Mr. Capece! Sit down. Dear Mr. Capece, I am glad to see you. Come. We can speak better inside. Sit down, Don Raffaele! I am glad you came. No! Don Raffaele, no... This is the Pope's chair! Sit comfortably. You are so handsome! - This is yours. - It's my savings booklet. I lost it last week. Good thing you found it. See? You lost it and we found it. - You're not giving it back? - Of course. Give me 700,000 liras and I'll give it to you. 700.000 liras? Your father lost it at bingo and left us the booklet as a guarantee. Your signature is on it, the same as the one on the bum check that your dad gave us. Verify it. What a nice dad! He learned to forge my signature! If I report him for a fake check, I have to report you too. Your name is here. That is why I called you. Did I do the right thing? Yes, but where will I find 700,000 liras? What will I do? Don Raffaele! An artist like you will find a way. - Don't kid around. - What did you understand? I meant that we can exchange favors. You do something for me and I do something for you. Yes, but what can I do for you, Giardino? - Do you know how to read music? - Yes, of course I do. - Well? - Play this serenade for me and I will return the check and the savings booklet. A serenade? When? - At five. - Tomorrow? - No this morning. In a half hour! - At five in the morning. Don't worry. A serenade! - Are you afraid of a serenade? - No. - Then you'll return it? - Of course I will! Wait in the car. - I have to wait? - Yes, in the car. She will take you where you will play the serenade. You'll get off and play. Understand? Whatever happens, you have no eyes or ears, and above all, no mouth. - Is that clear? - Yes. What about Dad's check? We'll talk on the phone tomorrow and I'll give you everything back. "The stranger leaning out the balcony of the last floor" "almost fell on top of me." "Something hit me over the head and I fainted. That's all I know." "I can't add anything else besides what I stated," "that of never having seen the victim of the accident before." Signed Capece Raffaele. - Son of Natale? - Yes, unfortunately. Yesterday at five in the morning, you played a serenade for a dark skinned man armed with a machine gun, you had never seen before. I didn't know he was dark skinned and that he would shoot at someone like me. Who commissioned you to play this ridiculous serenade? I'll tell you right away. The cause of my troubles is always my father. - Your father? - Yes, him. My father is addicted to gambling. - Gambling is forbidden. - I know it is. - But he does it just the same! - Go on. To fix all the problems that he creates, I have to accept mortifying jobs like serenades. - When the blond woman showed up... - The Volkswagen woman? Yes. I decided to do it for Dad. - Who was this blond? - I don't know! She didn't give me her ID. - Are you injured? - I ask the questions. - Alright. - They sent me to this city. - I am glad because I love Naples. - Good. But Neapolitans like you who want to get wise piss me off! They piss... What? You are free to go because the accident hypothesis was accepted. - I should say so. Look here! - It wasn't my decision. If it had been up to me, you'd have gotten old in prison. - You don't like me! - The victim was a foreign citizen. - A black man. - John Hover, from Jamaica. He was the brother of the opera singer, Elizabeth Hover. Secretary of the famous orchestra conductor, Victor Navarro. - Victor Navarro? - You know him? He is to conduct at San Carlo! Then you know that Victor Navarro is a very important person. He'll want to have a clear picture of this matter. I don't want to ruin my career because of sloppy southerners like you. - You are right. - Yes. - Esposito! - Sir, my name is Sposito. Ok! Have him sign and send him away. Come here! We'll take a picture. Don't move. We're taking a picture. - Don't move. - Where are we going? Come. We'll take a nice picture near maestro Navarro. Maestro Navarro? Madam, my condolences. Do you have a car? Yes, but it is still on the site of the tragedy. - Get in. I'll give you a ride. - To me? It's an honor! Thank you. - See you at the bureau. - Alright. I read your deposition. You found yourself involved by chance in this tragedy. - I can't remember your name. - Raffaele Capece. A mandolin teacher with a diploma. Musician! We are colleagues. I am one of your great admirers. When I can, I follow your concerts. - Berlin, Vienna, Salzburg. - You travel a lot. I wish! I hear them on the radio. - You never come to Naples. - Right. Now that I'm back, my concert has turned into a drama. Many memories tie me to this city. Happy and sad ones. The conservatory days, my first wife. The poor woman is dead. - My son. - You have a son here in Naples? Yes, but I haven't seen him in a long time. Walter is very proud, and has always refused my help. I had commissioned John to find him to spend Christmas with him, but unfortunately... - John is the black man. I mean... The lady's brother. It was a terrible tragedy. Nobody knows who the blond woman who commissioned you the serenade is? Maestro, I swear I don't know. Capece? Listen to me. I am willing to do anything to make light on this matter. If you manage to find out any detail, I will compensate you. I may need a mandolin teacher. I wanted to program a Vivaldi tour in Australia. Our encounter could become very fortunate for you. Will you help me? I'd cut my hands for you. Whatever I find out, I'll tell you right away. Where is the place my brother fell from? Madam, from that balcony on the last floor. Don't worry. He didn't notice a thing. He came down so fast! Victor, how is it possible? What was John doing up there? It's strange! I will be at the Teatro San Carlo for the entire holiday period. Come see me if you find anything out. Hopefully soon. Alright, maestro. Thank you for the ride. F sharp. F sharp, not G! Hold that mandolin well. Keep it up. - Did you bring the weekly payment? - Yes, sir. Your father took it this morning. - Did I make a mistake? - Go on and play. I never understood why we have to put a comet on the Nativity. But they say we must, so I'll put it here. It looks good. I don't like it. I've ever liked the Nativity, not even as a child. - Dad! - Who is it? - You don't have to tell me anything? - Yes. What time did you get in last night? You made me stay awake! - Where were you? - Where was I? Making amends for the trouble that you caused! Don't raise your voice in front of that little stranger. - Understand? A little respect! - What respect? You gamble with my savings in that disgusting gambling room! - You even made out a fake check. - Of course. I've a son who can't provide for his family! Money is necessary, a lot of it. - Lots, lots, lots. - Lots, lots, lots. You gamble it at lotteries, or playing bingo, in any possible way! You want to deny old people the joy of a little distraction with some gambling? - What a wretched son! - Dad, listen to me. I will go in the street and marry the first woman I meet. And I'll put you in a rest home. Yes, I will! Yeah, the first woman you meet is there waiting for you! As soon as she sees your flabby thigh, she'll go away! Dad, it is not a good morning! I'd throw this Wise Man in his face! He is Balthazar. It's true. Every time you want to win a woman's heart, she sees you and runs away. Of course. You tell them I have contagious polio! It's not true. I never said that. I sometimes mentioned progressive paralysis that comes from the bottom and slowly rises, and you don't know where it'll end up. If it's a man called Giardino, tell him I'm not here. He's a bore. - He asks everyone to borrow money! - Hello? - This is Giardino. - You've gotten me into trouble. - What happened? - The police is after me. - Rifle shots, a dead black man... - Keep your mouth shut. Yes, but prepare that thing for me an give me an explanation or it will open up. - Do you know the address? - Yes. Don't move. Don't move because I am in danger. Sir, who do you want? - Giardino. Is he here? - Yes, upstairs. If you want, I will call him. Giardino! Giardino! - Giardino! - Who is it? - Raffaele Capece. Shall I come up? - No, I'll come down. What is going on? Help! My God! What a tragedy! Maria! Holy Madonna of Carmine! Poor boy! Why did he do it? My God! Isn't anyone coming? - Maria! - What is going on, madam? Excuse me, please. May I have a match? Thank you. Did you see a girl get out of that car? - It went out. May I have another? - Yes, take it. - Take it. - Thank you. She must have gotten out... What are you doing? - Burning your coat. - My coat? - You are crazy! - Crazy? - I want the coat. I must burn it. - Let me go! Let me burn the coat! I really like it! - You want to burn my coat? - Give it to me, please. I like it. I want to burn it. Hold still, calm down. Let him go. It is over. Take him to his room. Sister, in my room. I'm sorry, Mother. I didn't know... He's not dangerous. He just has some little manias. Little? Imagine the big ones! Why are you at the hospital? Are you Professor Fiorito's patient? No, I'm nobody's patient. - Well? - I saw the car and... You must be a friend of Lucia's. - Is her name Lucia? - You're her friend, you should know. No... I mean, yes. I'm not really a friend. There she is. Excuse me. - Miss, may I have a word with you? - You came all the way here? - Aren't you tired of following me? - Did you notice me? You don't go by unnoticed with that old car! Yours doesn't go by unnoticed either. I saw it twice, and both times a dead person was involved. - I see enough lunatics here! - I am a lunatic? This car was in a courtyard a half hour ago. A man flew out the window and the night before, a black man flew out. What are you talking about? If you don't leave, I'll call someone and this will end up badly. - I'm going to call the police. Let's see if you talk to them. The police? What's the police have to do with it? - We'll see. - I can explain everything. - It is what I came to ask. - Not here. It's not possible in the hospital. Let's meet later. - I am in trouble. You understand? - Lucia! - We must decorate the living room. - I'm coming. I must go. I'll come where you work, at Filomena's. Alright? Alright. I'll be waiting. Elevator! - Fourth floor. Close it. - It's on the fifth floor. So much the better! If someone had to go to the fifth floor? I'm glad I live on the first. - If you want to go first... - Please. I say this because I walk slowly because of my problem. Go ahead. Thank you. Unfortunately, my leg... Excuse me, but how did you know it was on the fifth floor? I left it there. Of course! - Here we are! - Go on. - I've arrived. - This way. - Should I go up? - Better for you. - If you say so, let's go. - Walk more quickly now. - Excuse me, where are we going? - To the last floor. Naturally! I won't even get to the upper floor with this leg. I can't make it. Yes. I wanted to say I can make it. But you must be patient. I was just advising you. If my leg stiffens, we'll be stuck on the stairs. - If it does, I'll un-stiffen it. - If you guarantee it, I'll continue. - You are exaggerating. - Come on! Walk! Hurry up! Have pity. I am a disabled man. A poor invalid. They didn't even treat me like this in the hospital. - Go on. Don't get me upset. - Excuse me. It was a moment of anger. Go on! You have a lovely air in these parts. Breathe, breathe. It's good for you. Until the Almighty allows it. You are a man who has studied music. You are sensitive, so you should understand me. If it was up to me, we'd have a picnic in Posillipo. You could play songs with your mandolin. A tomato salad and we'd be happy. Unfortunately, we can't do that. - Excuse me, Mr... - Sella Gregorio. I am honored. Mr. Sella, if you tell me what you want, I can help you. - I didn't tell you? - No. I didn't tell him! Of course he didn't understand, if I didn't tell him anything! You couldn't understand because I didn't tell you. In fact. Listen, Don Raffaele. You played that famous serenade. - Remember? - Yes. Who asked you to do it? I ask myself that too. Who had me do it? - You see? You don't remember. - No. Then you take care of it, but don't show me, because it bothers me. What are you doing? Let me go! Help! Holy Mary! Help! - No! Pull me up. - Don Raffaele, now do you remember who asked you to do the serenade? - Yes, I remember. - He remembers! Pull him up. My leg! If you are comfortable and want to tell us... It was Giardino, the gambling house manager. You know him? Do we know him? Did you hear what he said? He asked us if we know Giardino! How did he do that? Giardino, come right down! Don Raffaele, who commissioned Giardino to have you play the serenade? - I don't know. - You don't know? - No. You take care of it, but don't show me because it bothers me. No! Mr. Sella, no! - I am innocent. Have pity! - Let him go. Let me go! You've never heard of a man called Navarro? Navarro? A maestro, a musician. Who doesn't know him? What's he have to do with it? It seems that the music you went to play is the key to the blackmail done to someone who has a lot to lose. There is a bone to nibble, and lots of dogs want it. It involves a lot of money in valuable currency. Did I explain myself well enough? Yes, but what do I have to do? Three small things to avoid trouble. You must find who the hell had you play the serenade. You must find out what the hell that music means, and find out where the hell they got it. Is that clear? Hell, yeah! Don Raffaele, somebody wants you. - Where? - Outside. Miss! - Are you waiting for someone? - Good morning, Chief. - Why are you in this area? - I heard someone calling so... Mrs. Filomena's cat always runs away! - Is her name "Miss"? - That's what she named her. - Come inside. It's better there. - I prefer staying outdoors. - It's smells like fried food inside. - Yes. Fish gives me a rash and I start to itch. I start to itch too, but then it goes away. You get used to it. - You play the mandolin here? - Yes, in the restaurant. Where do people jump from? From there, here, or Castel dell'Ovo? - What do you mean? - When you play the mandolin, people jump out of windows! - It's a coincidence. - Is this a coincidence too? - It looks like a check. Yes, it's a check. It happens to have your signature. It happened to be inside the home of that Giardino, who jumped out the window when you arrived. I wasn't expecting this insinuation from a kind person like you. Raffaele Capece, under this kind appearance, there is hidden a son of a bitch, capable of kicking even Lieutenant Sheridan's mother. - Have you ever been in prison? - No, I don't have a record. If you want to keep it that way, you must tell me the truth. Alright. It is my check. It was a gambling debt. Then everything is clear. You went to Giardino's for the check. He didn't give it to you, and you pushed him out the window. Unpremeditated murder, extenuating circumstances of provocation. If you plead insanity, you'll get less than 25 years. I was talking to the custodian when he fell. It's true. Mr. Capece when are you coming to play? People are coming inside! - I must go. - Should I turn on the juke-box? - I'm coming. - What a mess! Who is he? - A future customer. - A future customer! What's with Raffaele today? I'll get in. Miss, you told me you'd explain everything. - If you are comfortable, I'm here. - What do you want from me? Nothing. You can stop and I will get off. But first tell me where I can find the blond woman who was driving this car the other night. Who are you talking about? This is my husband's car. What does he have to do with the blond woman? If you don't know, your husband certainly does. We can go see him and ask. - And do away with any doubt. - It's what I want to do. - We'll see him and clear this up. - Let's go. - Excuse me, where is your husband? - You tell me! Since you came to the hospital, my husband Walter has disappeared. - Did you say Walter? - Navarro. - The son of maestro Navarro? - Yes. - His father told me about him. - What did he say? - I can't tell you. - It's not worth taking it out on someone like you. - That's for sure. Excuse me. May I? Please, could you... - Are you happy now? - You aren't... You are more beautiful. - Look. Water is leaking inside. - There's a hole here. Hurry, outside! - Did you lock it? It doesn't open. - I didn't. - Someone is outside. - It's Albino, that animal. He did it. Criminal! We'll drown here! Help me! Come, hurry! - It's broken. - The water is rising. We'll drown. Help! Move! - Menzogna. - What is it, Chief? Naples 920151. That's the car. Get down and check it. Help! Saint Gennaro! - Help! - Call for help! - Help! - Chief Voghera. - Chief! - Let us out! Open up. Help! - Well? - Nobody is here. Come back up. My instinct tells me he's elsewhere. Help! Police! - Chief Voghera! - Open up! Chief, help! - Help! - I don't know how to swim. - The boat is sinking. - What can I do? - Push. - Help! What happened? Did we touch the bottom? Yes. Maybe it's Saint Gennaro's miracle. - What'll we do? - Don't move or it tip over. They saw the boat sinking and will come to save us. - Hello? - Hello, Don Raffaele. - Who is it? - Sella Gregorio. - How did the swim go? - You disgusting criminals! I was trying to find out and you... This is the second warning. The third one will... - I will report you to the police. - Take care. - That bastard! - It's crazy. You can't buy eel anymore. The price keeps rising and its weight decreases. What times! - Dad, where are you going? - To piss. - You can't go in the bathroom. - Why not? - You just can't go. - Where should I piss? Don't piss. Do me this favor. Go in the kitchen. - Why can't I go inside? - There's a woman in there. - A woman? - Don't worry. She won't be staying here. She's married, no risk. I risk pissing in my pants. Let's not give a bad impression. Don't push. Where is the eel? - Hold the eel. - What an obnoxious son! I won't go out if you don't want. I am Natale Capece! How wonderful! I feel like another woman. A hot bath after that cold one. How lovely! It's a marvel. I made it. Dad likes it. I've never seen such a Nativity. I mean, in a home. They have one at the hospital too. - It's not the same thing. - Didn't you have one at home? I went from the Saint Rita boarding school to the Saint Rita hospital as a nurse. I never had a home. Is it true that it brings good luck to kiss in front of the Nativity? I think so. - A snake! - What? The eel got away. You are the lady who was closed in the john two hours. You must excuse me. That eel has seven lives. - On my leg? - Darn it! The eel! It bites! I apologize for my father. Come, drink something. Thank you, just a little. It makes my head spin. Tell me about yourself, about your husband, Walter. When we separated, he went back to living on the boat. - Why did you separate? - He'd gone back to his past life, associating with bad people and taking drugs again. That is why I returned to working in the hospital. We didn't see each other for 2 years, but he called me the other day. He was agitated and said that his life had changed. That he would pay me back for all I did for him. What? A man disappears for 2 years, suddenly pops up again, and you believe everything he says? No. Here. What could I do? I am alone, and he is still my husband. - Then what happened? - You know. I went to get him the day that Giardino fell from the window. He said to rush over to him. When I got there, he was ill. I took him to the hospital and hid him in my room. I went down because you arrived. When I returned, he was gone. - Disappeared. - Excuse me. Does Navarro know that his son is married to you, and all the trouble he got you into? - I don't think so. - They never saw each other. - The maestro must know. He said to go see him. I'll go and tell him everything. I'll even say, "Maestro, how fortunate you are" "to have such a lovely daughter-in-law as Lucia." - You are so kind! - I am not kind. You see, Lucia, even if I am older than you... Not much... My heart beats. It's still young and beating. Because... Since the moment I met you, really... I understood. She saw the skinny thigh. Don't worry. Your father is always here. The cane of your old age. Remember that. No, this is Verdi, not the Ave Maria! Please, some life. Let's start over, more warmth. Be ready. Sir. What are you doing? You can't stay here. - I must see the maestro. - You can't stay here. If you have an appointment, go to his dressing room and wait... - What is it? Who's there? I don't want anyone at rehearsals. Go away. Did you see what a mess you caused? Go away. Out! Excuse me, madam. - There's Mr... - Capece. - He said he has an appointment. - I know him. - Have him come in. - Alright. This music hides a big secret. A big secret of death. Let's drink to that. We have a secret in common. - Not on an empty stomach. - Do it for me. - Drink. - Cheers. The sound of this music is a sign of death. I want to find out if it's true. Maybe the truth is out there. Outside this window. - I want to fly. - Madam, what are you doing? - No, it's dangerous. - I must die. You want to fall? Come, calm down. Embrace me. Closer, embrace me. You must not. Maestro, I beg you to believe me. See? He is better than you. Coward. - Madam, maestro. - Impotent! Worm. No, stop. - Elizabeth is no longer the same. - I believe it. Lucky you, who have no problems. Only you and music, a great friend who never betrays. So, what's new? It's not easy to say. Try. Maestro, are you being blackmailed? Me? - Who says such an idiocy? - I don't know. I was told that. Nonsense. You came here to tell me this? Actually... - What else is there? - I met Lucia. You don't know her. She is your son Walter's wife. - My son's wife? - Yes. I didn't know my son was married. - Walter is with his wife now? - Not at this moment. Last time Lucia saw Walter was two days ago. He was ill. She took him to the hospital, but he disappeared. - Disappeared? - Yes. I must get back to my work. Come with me. - Maestro, the lady? - We'll let her rest. Could I meet this girl, my daughter-in-law? Maestro, next Sunday there is a hospital party where she works. Why don't you come? - With great pleasure. - Good. Maestro. Polio? No, a polo game. - You? Polo? - No, polio. Attention! I'm testing the microphone. One, two, three, four. One, two, three four. Now Peppino will play "Violin Christmas Song" for us. - Hi, Lucia. - Hi. I am glad you are here. I thought you'd come sooner. During Christmas, the traffic... Let me look at you. - You are elegant. - With all the trouble I'm in. No, we're close to the end of the year. Troubles must be forgotten. May I? Best wishes, even if a bit late. Why did you bother? There is no reason. It's a joy. There are so few left. Today is a day for gifts. Look here. I received an enormous bouquet this morning with a note from maestro Navarro. He announced himself in all his magnificence. Wow! He was very kind. - Did you talk to him about me? - I went to see him at the theater. - He was glad. - What he said about Walter and me? I don't want to say anything. You'll meet him and talk about it. This is not the right place to meet my father-in-law. "Father-in-law" is an ugly word. Maestro Navarro is the father of your husband, the man you love. You love Walter, don't you? Of course I love him. In fact. - Let's see what's in here. - It's not worth it. Later. It's nonsense. - How cute! - Do you like it? - It's pure virgin wool. - Thanks. You shouldn't have. There is a note too. "With this around your neck, you won't be cold anymore." You're such a dear! I have to go call the mother superior now. Your attention! Let's hear an applause for maestro Navarro and Mrs. Hover. Applaud. Play the music I asked you to play. The maestro's wife is beautiful! Do you like the music? Do you know it? You're Lucia. Did I guess? Yes, maestro. She is your son's wife. I am very happy. May I embrace you? Thank you for the flowers. Walter didn't tell me his father was so important. Who knows why. I am not surprised. I know my son's mentality. Walter and I have the same tastes in women. You're magnificent. Chief Voghera is here. You know him. - Eminence. - Yes, we met after John's accident. - You call it an accident! - Madam. Maestro. - Do you know Lucia? - Yes, I think so. She took a swim with you recently. What? Did you know? - You think we sleep at the station? - Watch out. Excuse me. The heaters are hot here. I feel it. I'm a policeman. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being with us. Thank you. The idea of a party with the patients doesn't mean, and must not be just comforting. Each of them must be treated as a friend, a brother, one of us. Spend this Christmas in the company... What is the name of that nun? Sister Angela. What was her name before she took her vows? I don't know. That is what we've always called her. Come up, come with me. Let's look in our hearts. If we are capable of helping, we will be helped. Each of them is like us, worthy of our respect. Bravo. I hope you will forgive me. Merry Christmas. Thank you, but you shouldn't have. It's beautiful. Did you hear the music they played? It's your serenade music. The same that they recorded on the reel. On the reel? Don't think about it. Come. Let's be merry. Beautiful! Your attention. We will play some music with Mr. Capece. An applause. Thank you. It is an honor. Mother Superior, may I introduce Mrs. Elizabeth Hover, the famous opera singer who is the lover... the wife... the companion of another famous artist, the great orchestra conductor who is here with us. There he is. The tall man over there, maestro Victor Navarro. - Mother. - It's nothing, dear. Don't worry. Let's not ruin the celebration. Continue. Don't interrupt. Continue playing. Excuse me. Let her by. Nothing happened. Madam, what shall we offer to this audience? - Do you know "Funiculì funiculà"? - Of course. Music. One, two, three and four. Yesterday night, Nanniné, I climbed there. You know where. Where the fire fries you but, if you run away, it lets you be. Want to dance with me? Let's go, let's go to the top Let's go, let's go to the top. Funiculì, funiculà! Funiculì, funiculà! Let's go to the top with the funicular railway. Help! Something terrible happened. There is a dead man in the kitchen. A dead man? Make way. I am a Milan policeman. - Silence! What happened? - There is a dead man in the kitchen. Take me there. Where is he? - There. - Where? - Here. It's Agostino Ampolla, the hospital electricity technician. He wanted to repair the refrigerator and got locked inside. "With this around your neck, you will no longer be cold." "Raffaele Capece." How shameful! I got called at the police station because my son is considered a murderer. - A murderer? The chief couldn't detain me. There were 200 witnesses that saw me playing on the stage. - Don't be angry. What are you saying? Don't you understand that a person tries to see something, and sees something else because it's a vision that is overturns... A vision. Listen. What had that midget done to you? I know. Of course I know. I am your father. I gave life to you. Alright. He saw you walking on the street like this, limping, and he called you "skinny thigh". In a moment of anger you strangled him. Tell the truth. I understand. - Dad. - Just a moment. I'm your father. I didn't know him, and he didn't do anything to me. - He didn't do anything. - No. - Then why did he wear your scarf? - Right. I'd like to know that too. Know what I'll do in the meantime? I'm going to the lottery and try my good luck because we needs loads of money. - What number is a strangled midget? - I don't know. I'm going to the lottery. Understand? Where is the "Smorfia"? - I don’t' know. - You never know anything. Hello, Saint Rita's psychiatric hospital? May I talk to the head nurse, Lucia Navarro, please? - Mrs. Navarro isn't there. - What? It's urgent. I am a friend. Call her. We went to see her too, but Mrs. Lucia can't be found. - Why are you here? What do you want? - The reel. - The reel. - See if it's on him. - Excuse me. - He doesn't have it. - Do you want to irritate me? - For what reason? You know what reel I mean. The one you used to record all the secrets of this shitty matter. - May I? - Please. That wise ass midget who wanted to do things by himself and ended up in the refrigerator like a frozen piece of shit. It's the first time I hear talk about a reel. - Are you making fun of me? - No. Look for the reel and be quick. No. What are you doing? - Are you kidding? - Sit down. Excuse me. Not the mandolin! Please, Dad's clock! I beg you. We only have one home. Please, have him stop. Have him stop. I like eating with music. Play. - How can I play? - Play! - It's not even here. - Play. - Faster. - On my leg. Play. Don't make noise. Macaroni for me too! - Please excuse him. He's hungry. - Eat. Not the television set. Holy Mary! Easy. Damn you! There's nothing here. You were right. The reel isn't here. No, it isn't. If it isn't here, we don't need you. - I don't know. To be truthful, I didn't like the music you played one little bit. Give me the mandolin. I want to break it over your head. - Saint Gennaro! - Dad. Look here. Holy Mary! - What happened? - Nothing. What do you mean by "nothing"? - There was an earthquake here. - Mr. Natale. The here present Mr. Raffaele had a fit. - An artistic fit. - A fit. He played his mandolin but it didn't come out well. He was so angry he destroyed everything. - Oh, that's it. - What I wanted to tell Raffaele is that surely we'll meet again. What didn't take place today will take place tomorrow. - I'll see you. - You mean him! Look here. This isn't a home. These are ruins. There was an air raid here. Listen... Look at yourself. Listen to your father. I don't want to get angry. You know I love you. I've told you a thousand times. You must not worry. It's not for the furniture which is now broken, I wanted to call an architect. A modern architect. He would've created a lovely home for you. You need a period of rest. Understand? Those criminals wanted to kill me. You know why? - For the toilet seat? - The reel. - The reel? - Yes, the reel. The reel! You realize that? Yes. The reel. The reel. Didn't you once say you have a friend at the Saint Rita insane asylum? - The blond woman. - What are you saying? - The reel. - Darn it! Right on my bunion! - Stop! - Are you always on top of me? You are a problem I want to solve. - You'll solve it, but she's here. - Who? - The blond woman. - Are you a police chief? Deputy chief. Who are you? Natale Capece. The father of a dangerous lunatic. Can I come in? Is anyone here? Go away. Go on. You are worse off than I am. The blond woman! See? You let her get away. Are you happy? We cripples don't even respect each another. Go away. - Are you afraid of Tommasino? - Yes. He's a good dog. He barks because he's afraid of you. Good boy. He won't hurt you. - Then I'll come down. - Come down. He runs away because nobody bothers closing the gate chain. - What can I do? - Are you the watchman? No, the carpenter. I've a store out in front. I watch the house. Before the war I did some carpentry work here. It was the home of the Coen family. They were rich Jews, good people. - Who lives here now? - Who do you expect? When the Germans came, Mr. Marco lived there. He was a good man too. He played the violin and argued with me because I used a noisy saw. Please, come. Excuse me. Hold the dog while I close the gate. What happened to Marco Coen? - A tragedy, poor man. - Really? The Germans came and took him to a concentration camp. I don't know. I wasn't there that day. When they told me, I was very sorry. Are you sure nobody ever comes here? May I let you in on a secret? In the Coen building, you can hear... - You can hear... - It's a cursed home. There are ghosts. At night you can hear noises, see shadows, lights moving behind windows, there is knocking. - It could be his soul. - His soul? You know how ghosts are. Maybe Coen returns to the building looking for something. He has no peace. What were you doing in the garden? I... Hold the dog. - I am looking for something too. - You too? Hello, Elizabeth? It's Capece, the mandolin player. Madam, I wanted to ask you a favor. Remember the reel you listened to the other day at the theater? Yes, the music one. I'd like to play it with my mandolin. I don't remember it well. If you could... Tonight at 10 at Club 94? Yes, it's New Year's today. Alright. Thank you and excuse me. Chief, you scared me. Will you give me a ride? - It depends on where you're going. - Same place you go. - I don't know where I'm going. - Me neither. Let's go together. - Well, what've you got to say. - It's up to you, Chief. Resistance to a public officer, escape and damage to an officer. - Anything else? - I have just begun. There is a report for mental incapacity. Who had this great idea? Your father. He said you destroyed the house and that you're dangerous for yourself and others. His is a national public calamity. You don't know him. I'll lend him to you and you'll see for yourself. He is bizarre. Not so much. He wants bounty money. - Am I a public enemy? - A person who does that to his home! - I didn't do it. - No? Who did? Who was it? The window was open and the wind... That's bullshit. What do you know about Sella and his gang? - I don't know him. - What about this note? It was attached to the brake. "Third and last warning." Shall I read the signature too? - If you want. - It's signed by Sella Gregorio. I'll take you to the station now and if you don't tell the truth, I'll keep you inside until your leg heals. What is going on? It's going faster. Slow down. - The brake doesn’t' work. - Change gear. - I only have one foot. - Slow down! The truck. The truck! Go on the sidewalk. Turn here. My balls are hurting on the seat! Watch out for the intersection. Be cautious. Honk. Slow down. Get your hands off the wheel! Turn! Turn at the uphill road. - Now we'll stop and get out. - The door is stuck. - It won't open. - Mine either. Saint Gennaro! Good morning. Will I bother if I leave the car a minute? Because I think I shit in my pants. Raffaele! Raffaele! I'm here. Come. Madam, sorry I'm late. I don't have a car. - I'm glad to see you at New Year's. - Thank you. Did you bring the reel? Yes, but let me dance first. Right away? I am not very familiar with dancing. I'll try. I'll wait outside. You're here. I thought you had left. - What are you doing? - Take some. It's good for you. - What is it? - Cocaine. No. I don't even drink coffee. - Many big artists take it. - Even the maestro? Yes. He taught me. He takes it to conduct better. I take it to find the courage to betray him, and I want to do it now. No, madam. That's how I like you. Now you're as strong as he is. Crippled men excite me. Neapolitan crippled men excite me even more. - You like Neapolitan crippled? - You know why? - Why? - They're like the Vesuvius. - The Neapolitan cripples. - Yes. - And then? - They are boiling hot. - Like pizza with tomato. - Pizza... Pizza with tomato. Take this octopus with tomato sauce. - You want a sea bream? - Hug me. Buffalo mozzarella. I like African buffalo mozzarella. Give it to me. "Scapece" zucchini at 13! Beautiful! This cursed music. - Wait. - What is it? The reel! It was all erased. The midget had given it to Victor. The reel... - One day he'd brought it to him. - The reel. There were voices recorded after the music. The reel after the music. - There is nothing now. - Nothing. The animal! The animal! These parties are really boring. - The phone? - It's there. Can't you see it? Hello, Saint Rita hospital? I'm looking for Lucia, the nurse. I'll wait. She won't answer. See how long she's taking? As they say... You can always find better. Sir... Miss... May I have a word with you? Maybe we've saved New Year's. - What is it? - Excuse me. Are you a man? - Why? You don't like that? - A man with a wig. I understand now. - What did you understand? - Lucia, it's Raffaele. Yes, I found the reel. The deal? No, the reel. The midget had it. The guy who died in the refrigerator. Agostino Ampolla. Where did the midget live? You don't know? Of course not! Alright. I'll deal with it myself. Good night. Happy New Year. Ampolla... Ampolla... Ampolla Agostino. Vicolo Annunziata, 3. Are you leaving me by myself? - Where is the bathroom? - Over there, dear. - Come! - What a rush! Slowly. You'll mess me all up. Go inside. - Get undressed. - We're having an orgy? Everyone naked. Where is the cripple? The cripple with a moustache. There was one here earlier who was on the phone. - Where is he? - In the john, I think. Excuse me. - Where is the john? - Over there. Another glass and that's it. Pretty girl, come here. - Fuck off. - Keep me company. Come here. Ampolla Agostino. "Agostino Ampolla. Electricity technician." This is the recorder. They recorded him from here. This is the reel. Who is it? Stop right there. Come here. Let me see you. Why are you dressed like that? What am I dressed like that? I'm getting ready for New Year's Eve. That's what I'm doing. - You scared me! - What's gotten into you? Nothing. Nothing at all. On the phone a half hour ago you said you didn't know the address. I know, but I couldn't explain it on the phone. Oh, sure! You are so kind that you came to tell me personally. The doctor and Sister Angela were next to me. How could I talk? Of course, you couldn't. - What are you doing? - What should I do? Use my clothes. Dressed like that, they'll think you're a fag. - Me, a fag? - Give me your dress. - Should I undress? - If you're shy, I'll turn around. I am not shy. You can tell you know nothing about women's dresses. I don't? I took this off of a woman, off a man, a fag, as you say, who is a transvestite like the blond who took me to do a serenade. What? Why was the scarf I gave you around the midget's neck? And your car outside my home and then outside Coen's building. - Let me go. - Enough of this innocent air. This mystery that nobody must unveil. Even these legs that you stick under my nose. I am disabled but... - Are you crazy? - I am crazy about you. Raffaele! You want to rape me? I'll let you do it. - May I? - Then I'll open the window and jump. You too? It's a fixation! The animal! - Hello? - It's Sella. - Did you find the reel? - No, damn it the hell! I don't understand a thing here. It's useless now. I found Walter. - Come to the Coen building. - Alright. You're here! Where are you running? Come here. I'll cut off your ear. Come. Let's run this way. The animal! Run, up the stairs. Run! Bastard. Hurry! The exit must be over there. Run! - The cape got caught. - Darn it! - Run! - You chicken! Hurry! Come on, Lucia! - It's locked. - Locked? I'll butcher you. - Hurry. Let's go to Walter. - Sella said at the Coen building. You must excuse me. I behaved badly earlier because that woman gave me... There is excitement involved in these dramatic facts that I... Everything will work out. You'll see. Happy New Year. - We have to climb over it. - No. The chain isn't locked. Come in. It's open. Let's go inside. Come. Nobody is here. It's Walter. He's upstairs. Upstairs? Wait. - What is going on? - Wait. I'll lead the way. Mr. Walter. Come. The more the merrier. Come, please. Give the chief a hand. I don't have much time. I must return to the party. - Open. - Open what? He thinks that behind this wall there is Mrs. Lucia's husband. - Walter? - Go on! I'll shoot you in the face to have you hurry! It's New Year's and everyone is shooting anyway. Find the secret door! Break everything. Knock down the bookcase. - Bastards! Leave me alone. - Grab him by his hair. Pull it. - We finally found you. - We had two flat tires. - Run! - Someone fell. Don't look. Go away. - He ended up like the others. - Chief. Why was Sella here? Maybe the same anonymous call that advised me, advised him too. Sella thought that Walter Navarro would be here. I think there is something, too. Knock it down. If he caught him, he thought he'd get millions in valuable currency. - Swiss francs. Right, madam? - What? - I know nothing about it. - Yes. The lady is looking for her husband who's been missing for a few days. I know. You can't imagine how much the police knows. - We're ready, Chief. - Open. Holy Mary! Who is he? He can't be the lady's husband. He doesn't look like someone who was fine 3 days ago. Who is he? Maybe the explanation is in here, Chief. Let's hear it. They are doing a roundup. Come. Let's hide in here. - They'll never find us here. - No, Marco. One of us must stay. They surely heard the music. They won't do anything to me. I am not Jewish. You go. Hurry. - Good morning. - We are looking for Mr. Marco Coen. He must come with us for certain verifications. Mr. Coen has left. I am the new tenant. Look, these are my IDs. Everything is in order, isn't it? Alright. This is just a simple control. Thank you. Sorry to have bothered you. Open! I can't breathe in here. Open. Will you open? I'm suffocating. You want me to die? Victor! You know everything now. I killed Marco Coen. We studied together at the Conservatory. Naples was getting ready to revolt against the Germans. We were worried only about our music and the girl we were both in love with. She was beautiful, really beautiful. She preferred Marco. I was blinded by envy and jealousy. When the German soldiers came for him because he was Jewish, he hid in the secret room in the library. I locked it and never opened again. Everyone thought the Germans had taken him to Germany. That is how it ended. An atrocious crime. - I thought it was forgotten forever. - What happened to the girl? Who cares! Maybe she found peace. - Go on. - The blackmailing began a few weeks after my arrival in Naples. They threatened to reveal my old crime. The day I had locked up Marco behind the library, I hadn't noticed that the recorder on which we practiced had been left turn on and had recorded everything. I don't know how, but they had gotten a hold of it. They wanted a million Swiss francs. I could have paid, but I didn't trust them. Is there more champagne? With the help of John, I hired two killers, Sella and Albino. The serenade was the signal for payment. Those criminals killed my secretary because they wanted the evidence against me and take over the blackmail. If Don Raffaele hadn't been involved in this matter, maybe I wouldn't have found out that the blackmailer was my son Walter. You know the rest. Those two, Albino and Sella, killed Giardino. They wanted evidence that he didn't have. The midget, my son's accomplice, who hosted my son, tried to blackmail me too, on the evening of the hospital party. I was forced to kill him by putting him into the refrigerator. When I read in the papers this morning about the death of Sella and Albino, I thought I'd gotten off the hook since I'd found out that my son had died too. - Walter is dead? - Yes. - Who told you? - Someone called me. An anonymous voice. It said that the midget had killed my son. The midget had to make a copy of the reel. He wanted more and they argued over this. It took place after Walter ran away from the hospital. I'm glad this nightmare is over. May I play the second part of my last concert? Thank you. Raffaele... I have a debt with you. I wanted to get your collaboration as a musician, and I really intended to do so, but it's too late now. I'm sorry. Bravo, maestro! An artist, a great man like him, will survive this too. To his memory. What? He always said the most beautiful thing for him would be to die on the podium with a baton in his hand. I didn't stop him. The pill he took with the champagne was poison. The pill was poison? Make room. - Let's tell the investigating judge. - He poisoned himself. - Here. - May I help? Raffaele! What a lovely surprise! I didn't want you to leave without saying goodbye. - Thanks. There's that one too. - I'll get it. - It all happened so quickly. - Right. I must run to Geneva to straighten up the inheritance matter. Now that father and son are dead, the Navarro wealth is yours. You have become rich. Not rich, very rich. Even if I've only spoken to the attorney on the phone. I understand. Darn it. Couldn't they come? I must go all the way to Switzerland. I have to get used to travelling. I want to enjoy life. - Isn't it what you wanted? - Why did you think of coming here? It was a voice inside. This morning I was going to work when that voice said, "Raffaele, where are you going?" "You must go to the airport" "because Lucia is going away and leaving you like an idiot." You are strange today. I don't like your face. It's my face. - Well, goodbye. - May I tell you something else? That same voice this morning made me suspect that in this matter you made a fool of me, to avoid saying "an ass of me", but it's not polite with a lady. You are a lady now with all that you inherited. A lot of money, more than you thought blackmailing him. - What are you saying? - There's someone else in Geneva. There's also a nice young blond man who happens to look like Walter. And he happens to also look like the blond serenade woman. Are you crazy? Walter died, and the dead must be left in peace. When they are dead, but the body was never found. If the body had been found, alive, he would have had to answer to many offences. You came all the way here to tell me all these ugly things? No, to tell you that the recorder found in the midget's home from which you got the reel, I returned to its owner, the diabolical Sister Angela. When she met Walter, the son of the man she hated, she suggested the idea of blackmail. She'd get revenge, you'd get money. Quite a brilliant plan. None of this matters anymore. Navarro paid for his crime. The delinquents killed one another and you got what you wanted. We are all happy. It is true that artists live off of imagination. Raffaele Capece, Natale's son! Hey! Chief, are you leaving too? I am going to Milan on a vacation prize for the Navarro case solution. My compliments and have a good trip. I have to rush, or Filomena... You're still going to work with the good fortune you had? - Good fortune? - Right. You don't know. The notary told your father that maestro Navarro, since he had no direct heirs, left all his wealth to you. It's 50 million Swiss francs. 50 million Swiss francs? Yes, 50 million Swiss francs. 50 million Swiss francs!
