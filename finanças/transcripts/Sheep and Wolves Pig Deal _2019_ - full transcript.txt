Boss! Boss! Boss! You gotta hear this! The sheep... she says they... And the wolves... and the... I had to tell you. It's, um, uh... crazy! Did you come here to show off your vocabulary? The Gypsy hare! She said there's a pack of wolves that live with sheep! And they're not eating them. What? Impossible. She said... she's telling everyone, there's wolves and sheep living together! I'm not deaf. Where is this hare? Back at the Crossing. Out of my way. Once upon a time, there was a young wolf named Grey, poised to become the next leader of the pack. He was in love with a beautiful she-wolf named Bianca. And though she loved him back, she thought he was too carefree, too selfish. Grey set out, determined to change his ways and win her heart. And, to his luck, found the most incredible, brilliant, wise, and accomplished Gypsy hare, who also happened to be wildly attractive... Okay, Mami, I think we get it. Will you let me finish? Anyway, Grey came to me. I helped change him, all right. One potion later, he became a ram! With no other choice, he lived among the sheep, learning to adapt to their culture. When his old pack made to attack the sheep, Grey led the herd and defended their town. He defeated the tyrant pack leader Ragear, wooed the fair Bianca, and once again became a wolf. He brought the community peace, but more importantly... Now you too can own Grey the Wolf merchandise! Check out all our options. T-shirts! Baseball caps! This adorable bobblehead! Eh? Cute, isn't it? And by the way, I've got potions for every need. Fur growth? Hoof growth? Maybe, horn growth? New color? I'll make a new squirrel out of you. And only today, you can get this special Grey calendar, two for the price of one. Make doubly sure to be on time! So, how can I get to this marvelous village? The map goes as a present if you buy three bobbleheads. Hey, no touching. Like I said, I've got potions for every need you can think of. Top quality potions! This one is a top seller... for a permanent wave. Come on, these won't last long. Okay, bunny, what did I tell you before? That's not for you... Uh, well, this look is all the rage, I can tell you that much. Sheep is very in this season. Look what you did, you naughty bunny. Huh. What did I tell you would happen? Gentlemen. Perhaps I can interest you in a T-shirt? Rumor has it you've been making up stories about species cohabitating. Stories? A village where wolves and sheep live together. They're more than stories. They're true. You're lying. That's against the laws of nature. I've been called many things in my time. And "liar" is not one of them. This village exists, ruled by the kind and just leader Grey. Where is it, then? You will tell me, rabbit. How about this shirt? It matches your eyes. Okay now, coo-coo. Not so fast, you're coming with us. Take her junk and grab that ewe, too! We'll need a snack for the road. Aah. Hey, don't move! Good morning, world! - Nice catch! - Catch? Huh? Yeah! - Morning, Grey! - How's business? Oh, you know! All's wool that ends wool! Everyone's in such a good mood. Aren't they, though? It's a good day! Why the long faces? Just kidding, I know it's your snouts. Here, have a doughnut! Ugh! Herbivores. You got this, all right. Don't be nervous. What? Who, me? Yep. I'm nervous. Sweetie, don't worry. You deserve this. And I'll be right here by your side. Friends! We gather today in celebration. One year ago today, our societies came together. Whether you have hooves or paws, fur or wool, we have one wolf to thank for our era of peace. And today I hand over the reins of government to that very wolf! Go on, I'm so proud of you. Everyone, may I present, the honorable Grey-ey-ey! Hello! Hello, everyone, good to see you all together! Ladies! Thank you, thank you. Phil, lookin' good. Oh. - Hello, handsome. - Uh... Gotta go. For saving our village and ushering in an era of peace, I give you my staff, symbol of power and our gratitude. Everyone, let's hear it for Grey, leader of wolves and sheep alike! Aw, thanks, guys. Thanks a lot. Honestly, thank you. I promise to do my best to maintain peace and prosperity, and to preserve equality, no matter your species. But first, let's party! - Belgour! Belgour! - Huh? Belgour! Coming in too hot! Oh! Belgour! Belgour! - What's wrong, Clif? - Something is going on. Strangers, out by the gates. A fox and a ewe, and there's two wolves chasing them. Wolves? Hey, now, everyone calm down. No need to worry. I'll check it out. Need help? No, it's no big deal. I'll be back in two shakes of... Well, you know. Let me go with you. We're having a celebration here after all. And even so! What can happen to me anyway? Just stay here and look after them, and I'll be back before you know it. Go on, guys. Have fun! Uh... what's going on? Whoa, just asking. - Leave us alone. - Geez, I just... - Where you guys headed? - None of your business! Why are you yelling at me? Hey, you're not going to eat her, are you? What? Are you crazy? Stay right there. - Aah! - Oh. Hey, pal, we're having a conversation. Don't "pal" me, mutt! Mutt? You know this guy? We can do this the easy way or the hard way. Go chase your own tail, loser. Seems you might need some help. You're, uh, doomed, yeah! Go to the gates up ahead. They'll help you. - But... - I'll stay here. Seems these guys need some puppy training. Who do you think you are? Aah... Hey... - What's that? - You better... I'm sorry. - Huh! - Grey, isn't it? You know my name? Sweet, I always wanted to be famous. Your alliance with sheep is disgusting. It gives a bad name to... to carnivores everywhere! You're a wolf. A predator. Top of the food chain. Throw all this foolish stuff out of your head. The largest wolf festival is coming in just three days. Come to our pack and we'll celebrate it like all the wolves do. I hope we'll have some mutton on our tables. Otherwise, we'll come to your village and celebrate it right here. Hey, um... excuse me. Can we help you? My name is Simone. I heard about a place where wolves lived in peace with sheep, hamsters, bunnies, and, um... With herbivores. Yeah, I just don't want to be enemies with herbivores anymore. Josey here and I ran away to see if it was true. Oh-h-h! Uh... Hi. Did it hurt when you fell from the sky? 'Cause you're makin' me crazy. Wait, no, I meant... Your eyes are like... Oh. Wait. No, sorry... You all right, pal? Go on, you were saying something about my eyes? - No, I wasn't... - 'Cause I think my eyes are cerulean, but the missus says they're just plain blue. What do you think? Well, that's not what... Oh. Grey's not back yet. Something must be wrong. Hey, Grey! How are you? Yay! Hey, Grey. Hi! Grey! When I grow up, I'll be protecting the village, just like you. Of course, you will. I have bad news. We're being threatened by the dark wolves. They're demanding that we go back to the way things were before, and if we don't, they'll attack. - Oh, no. - And things have just started to go well... So what do we do? Run? They can't do this! You're right, they can't. We've worked hard to achieve peace. We won't let anyone else tell us how to live. But how can we defend ourselves? Everyone knows the dark wolves are the strongest. I heard they're real scary. So we just roll over and give up? No. If we run away now, we'll be on the run forever. We have to fight for our beliefs. They can't push us around. We have a right to maintain our peace. You're absolutely right, sweety. I'm with ya, 100%. We'll show 'em what we're made of. We'll give those barbarians a fight! Bucho, get all the strongest together. - We'll start training for battle. - Right. I'll make a plan of the fortress. Why do we need a plan? We'll just figure it out as we go! Go get all the heavy things you have. We need to fortify the main gates. Bring anything you can find! Ohh! Huh? What's that? No idea. Found it in Belgour's shed. Oh. Uh... Hmm. Hmm. We've started to build a fortress here! Already? Yeah, and we're gonna finish it in just a bit. Oh, you're gonna be so proud. And then I'll show the guys a few great techniques. Remember the one with the deceptive maneuver? - Grey, Grey! Grey! Listen! - And the other one is like... Now you're a leader of the united society. You don't have to report to me on every decision you make. They're all up to you. - But... - They're all up to you. Yeah, but I was just, like, I was... Scared? Oh, don't worry, nothing's wrong with it. We, your people, will always follow you and help you in the hour of need. Thank you, Belgour. Now hurry up. The fortress won't build itself. Oh, yeah. Thanks, Belgour. By the way, the second technique I was talking about... Come on, you need to go! On it. Huh? Oh! Get me off this thing! Help! Ohh! Well, at least this might distract them for a while. Ziko, is this some kind of joke? Do you have a better idea? I always have better ideas than this. - Which are? - We need a plan for the new fortress! Then why don't you just make it? Me? You're the chief engineer, so get to work! Hurry up, Ziko, hurry up! It must be ready in half an hour! I see it... I see your future. The cards are telling me that you're all gonna get a swift kick in the rear. Yup, a long journey ending in total defeat. Mind your words, Gypsy. What? I don't tell the cards what to say. Here's your long journey, there's your kick in the rear, and the winner, the King of Hearts. Tomorrow, that mongrel Grey will serve up his sheep on a platter. He's afraid. Ohh, wait. I'm seeing something... What? What is it? I see a big furry idiot. How dare you! Boss! Boss! They're building... ...one of those things. Think they can fight back, do they? Don't blame the messenger, boss. If that's how they want to play, let's show them a thing or two about nature. A little high-strung, isn't he? Actually, today's better than usual. Gather up, everyone! We're gonna attack now! Right! You're dumber than I thought, Grey. If only you had listened. - Garky, the first step is to accept the problem. - What? What? Might I remind you, that you're a prisoner, you worthless hare! Exactly! That's what the cards said... "Don't go out today, or it's gonna be bad." But I'm saying we're attacking now, and you can't stop me! Oh. That's exactly what I'm talking about. See what your temper does to you! When danger reared its ugly head, the most brilliant minds in the village came together to defend themselves. What I am about to show you will astound and amaze you. Behold! If all goes to plan, this'll be the strongest fortress ever! An observation tower, an entrance, a dormitory, a canteen... Ooh! Is that a pumpkin? That's a fortress item. I can help bring supplies. Thank you, darling. That's great. Ziko, give everyone a task and let's get to it. On it. Hm. Hobbler, assemble a group... Oh, uh, me too. Right? - ...and get the foundation ready! - Right? Chuck, take the second team and build the tower. Wait, uh, how about me? Carrie, you're in charge of defense. What do I do? Guys? Nothing. You stay quiet. But I want to build. Let me help. If Carrie can lead a team, why can't I? Because I'm responsible. But I want to build! And I want to live. - What do you mean? - Don't touch anything. Who's in charge of defense again? It's a ewe. - Me? - No, a ewe. - I'm in charge of defense? - No, Carrie is. - Carry what? - Carrie the ewe! - Who's carrying me? - What? - I'm confused. - I thought you were Skinny. Hey, I mean, I could stand to gain a few, but... - Oh. You mean... - Yeah, ewe. Oh, you. No, Carrie's the ewe. Argh! He's so weird. Who needs help? Hm? Ah. Oh. All right, let's move it. Put those stakes in there. No, no, no, Phil, tighter! Moz? Moz, what are you doing? Don't nail that shut! It's a hatch! A hatch? Why do we need a hatch? There's railings along here that'll keep the dark wolves from getting in. They'll have to come from over here, so we'll open this hatch, and then... Bam! Sneaky and creative. So, why don't we make it bigger? I'm sorry, last time I checked, I was the one in charge of building the fortress. Here, go help that way. - Where? - Over there. Far away. - Where exactly? - Anywhere but here! See that? Yeah. Spikes! And falling stuff. I don't want to be under falling stuff. We need to tell this to the boss. Let's hurry. Except this time, it's your turn to tell him. Ah, another win for Mami! You cheat! No need to show your teeth, mister. I can't help being clever. One more game? Oh, get lost! I can't. If I recall, I'm your prisoner. Look, you seem so angry all the time. Have you tried chamomile? I'm not angry. Of course not. So how does that make you feel? Well, it all started when my mother... Wait. What? No! Somebody get her out of here! - This way, ma'am. - Thank you, kind sir. - How's the muzzle? - Great! Your herbal compress worked wonders, Mami. Why don't you just make her a nice pot of tea while you're at it? Get out! Wait! What's that? What's what, sir? That! A cotton-polyester blend, sir! Plus, it washes pretty easily. Get that out of my sight before I rip it off! And what's happening with the report I asked for? Uh, Dum! The fortress! Coming! What in the world is happening here? I'm reporting, sir. Grey's village is building a fortress complete with traps. Ooh. Plot twist, am I right? Hey, Gark! Have you heard? The situation is... Garky, Garky. You really should watch your blood pressure. Here, take a break. A blanket and some nice tea will help. Now, you mustn't feel like Grey... Hands off me, hare! I'm fine. I have someone in the village who'll take care of that stupid fortress. And when I take this cast off, Grey will wish he'd never crossed me. Psycho. Pour it! And now get busy with the supports and leave me alone! What? Mmm-hmm. Huh? Look, are you sure that's the way it should be? If it's drawn this way, then it is! You just have no idea how things are done! Stop getting in my way, you're distracting! That's weird. Hey! What are you... Why are you dragging him by his nostrils? Okay, someone, call the doctor! Hey, Bucho, how's the training going? Well, they need to dust off their skills, so we're just going through the basics. So, how bad is it? Let's see, we got five sprains, three broken bones, seven dislocations. I mean, let alone the... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Bucho, if it's going that badly, maybe try starting with a warm-up? That's what I'm talking about. That's how the warm-up went! Well, as for the training itself, 23 broken bones... Bucho, Bucho, hang on... Uh... What is this? This is designed to measure the force of horns hitting a tree with a running start. Oh! Love it! What's the record so far? Oh, so far... So far, we've just been trying to actually hit the tree! A little help. Why aren't they taking part? Oh, the medical board! They are X'ed out for health reasons. Here are the notes. The notes? What notes, Bucho? No excuses! The dark wolves are crafty. They'll use any trick, any opportunity to invade our village. - So we have to keep our eyes... - Right there. Right there! Oh, why on earth is it so heavy? What's that? Delivery for the village. Paid by the sender. Please sign at the bottom. - Oh, well, if it's already paid... - Bucho, no. Return it to the sender. Bucho, as I've already said, now you have to be extra-cautious, even extra-extra-cautious. If you don't know how to be extra-cautious, please, invite Ziko. He'll give you a full lecture. He's an author of two books on the topic after all! Okay, it seems the guys are not in very good shape at the moment. They can hardly manage the route march and... Yeah, 100 feet is a pretty harsh distance for these guys. They find 100 feet pretty harsh? Bucho, I... I see you here find everything pretty harsh! Yeah, true that. What? Bucho! Give it to me! How are the physical fitness standards? - Weight lifting... - Well... if the weight is actually heavy, well, there's a problem. What about the long jump? Well, it's not that long, and more of a fall. The obstacle course? Javelin throwing? Are you serious? You would trust them with a javelin after what you saw? Uh... What about the wolves? The wolves must be all right. They have a sense of smell and all the necessary instincts. Oh, last time we played hide-and-sheep, it didn't go very well... Err... Over there, over there, over there, over there... What on earth is going on in this training camp? Uh, you're right, the guys are not in good shape... Oh, really? You think so, too? But it's not just about that. Someone has been interfering with the training. Interfering? But who? Who'd do that? It could be any... It could be any... It could be anyone, any wolf. Yeah! Or any sheep. Hey, don't go there. I mean, someone is making the guys confront each other. Constant fights, arguments. This one gets less food than the others in the canteen, another one gets too much ice. One sabotage. Another mess up. Something here and there. How can any of them practice together when the guys don't trust each other? Of course, they are angry and suspicious of... Yes, Rudolf, what's up? Oh, I just saw you standing here and thought I'd come by to have a chat. Thanks, but later. Uh, um, oh, okay, bye, Grey. See? He is furious! I'm doing my best to fix things. They all look up to me. But the atmosphere is fraught with tension. But, Bucho, who would want to sabotage us? Are you sure you aren't, um, seeing things? Seeing things? Hey, Fred, Grey asks, "Am I seeing things?" When Fred landed in the swimming pool, all the water was gone. Oh, Fred, how are you feeling? He'll answer you... when his hearing comes back. Oh, goodness! Oh, he'll be all right. He'll still jump into that swimming pool. Right, Fred? As they say, "Down but not out." Huh? Every day some of our guys get into these horrible traps, sometimes even several times. For example, imagine, you're practicing your net buster to give those dark wolves a hard time, but instead of a regular one, you get a bowling ball. Then you switch to a safer, less traumatic type of training and wait for the shuttlecock to hit with your racket... only what you get is a bowling ball. Then you lie in a hospital ward after things have been so hard on you, and think, "Oh, finally, I can have a nap", so you pull the cord to turn off the lights... - ...and there comes a bowling... - Okay, okay. I get the idea. Get everybody together! Soldiers, you're the best we have, uh... Huh. Let me show you how you can stand up for yourselves. Now, who wants to volunteer? Take a step forward. Okay, Fred doesn't count. - So, how long are you going to... - Grey! - Huh? - Grey, the towers are crashing down. Oh, no. Run! - Look out! - Watch out! Come on, everyone, hurry! Huh? Oh. Oh, for crying out loud! Oh. Help! Somebody! Help! Help! Oh... Oh! Skinny! Hurry! Is everyone okay? Oh, that was awful! - What happened? - I was so scared. Psst. Grey. Grey. Psst. Over here, Grey. I just need a moment. Ziko, I'm really busy. Our fortress fell apart, and we need a new plan. Don't you wonder why? Someone sabotaged our blueprint. Someone added a fixture. It messed up the whole architecture of the thing. Weird. It's more than weird. Who do you think would do that? Well, I'm not pointing hooves here, but we do have a suspicious newcomer among us. Simone? Like I said, I'm not pointing hooves. - But she seems so nice. - It could be a ruse! What if the dark wolves had her infiltrate us without knowing? What do they know we know? When do they know that we know that they know? And if we know that they know, how do we know and when do we let them know that we know? You know? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ziko, I have no idea what you're talking about. What I said was, how will we know if they know if I know that they know... Stop. At any rate, if someone messed with our plans, we should keep an eye out. Can you do that for me? With pleasure. Oh. Huh? Huh? Oh. Hey, Josey. Hey, Josey! Ah! Hm. Oh. ♪ La, la, la, la, la... ♪ See anything interesting? No! I mean, uh... Not that you're not interesting, I'm just... Spying on me. Since yesterday. No. Not at all. No. I just... Are you, um, following me? What? No! Of course not. Small town, you know? Gotta run into everyone some time. Sometimes I wonder if I'll run into myself one day! I get it. Sorry, Ziko, you're not my type. That is not why I've been following you. There! So you admit it. Uh. Yeah, but for another reason. I want to know what you've been up to. Oh, my dream is to become a botanist. Is that why you've been picking up flowers all day long? Yeah, look what I've got here! I've wasted my whole day looking for a spy, but found only a botanist! What'll I tell Grey? That you've found a great botanist! Grey! What do we do? Oh! The fortresses have crashed down. What are we supposed to do? - Well, I just... - How are we gonna defend ourselves? No, no. The plan is... you all go and line up. Yeah, start a lineup and... and find some equipment for self-defense. Huh? What is it that bothers you, Grey? Um... I... You see, Belgour, uh... Sadness is what I feel from you. The dark wolves are already here, but I'm only good for nothing. I can't lead, I can't train, I can't be a hero. On top of that, my fortress nearly killed everyone! I can't be a leader. I'm afraid... you've made a mistake. How interesting. You say I've made a mistake, but believe that I can still be a leader. And you've made a mistake, too. So why can't you? - Um... - Who told you that a leader can't make any mistakes? But I thought... Oh, ooh. Having no mistakes doesn't make you a leader and a hero, Grey. But admitting your mistakes and accepting them as part of your journey does. You mean... Any chaos can be transformed into something beautiful. Transformed? That's it! Mami! We need to get Mami to help us! She can, I don't know, turn the dark wolves - into bugs or something! - Uh... Or make all the sheep into wolf warriors! Wait, that's not what I... Thank you, Belgour! Great idea! Oh, and before I go... ...how did you, you know, do all the colorful wind and stuff? - I... - No, wait. Don't tell me. I get it, it's a secret. Okay, bye! This new generation... think they know everything. Tails and ears must be tucked in. Horns and hooves must be tucked out. Okay. Okay. Not sure. This one is a no. Okay. What you need to know about the enemy is... Why do we have to fuss with this stuff at all? Well, why wouldn't we? We need to measure the force of the horns! Why measure it? They destroy these things in two blows, and then we have to hang in the new ones! Well, I guess it means it's a good thing we're hanging them. Who's there? Who? A dark wolf? Oh, don't hold me back! I... Oh, Grey, that's you! Great, guys, you're doing great. Great shape, nice outfit! Hey, you keep your head safe, you're doing it right. You don't have to worry about us! Yeah! Me and my friend have a debt! We're ready, Grey! How's it going, everyone? We've handed out the defense weapons! What should we do now? We need to find Mami. Quickly. Mami? But that's impossible. She could be anywhere. I know where she is. She's being held prisoner by Gark. He caught her at the Crossing. Psst! She's not a spy! She's just a botanist! - What? - I know, right? What's a botanist? It's... Oh, you're hopeless. Grey. I'm going to help Mami. - I'll go with you. - Bianca, but... I already came too close to losing you once. - Hey! - Huh? Intruder...

Now, you don't want to pull too tight - or you won't be able to... - Psst! - ...get out. - Hey, Mami. Do you think I look good in green? Dum says I don't, but I like it. I think any color you like looks beautiful. That's what I said! But he said it clashes with my brown fur. - It does! - You don't say. So I tells him, brown goes with everything! And he? And he says brown don't go with anything! So what am I supposed to do, eh? So I went with the green yarn anyway, because in life, you have to overcome negativity. That's what I always say. Overcome the negativity. - Do you, now? - Yeah! 'Cause you gotta do what makes you happy... What? What is all this? - Where's the prisoner? - She's just teaching us some... Oh. - Oh? - Oh! Oh! I'll teach you a thing or two! Go bring her back this instant! Mami, we need your help! Anything, dear wolf. We need a potion. Oh, dear. They have all my potions. But nevermind! Let's try some experiments and see what happens! A pinch of this, a bit of that. Now I've got it. What will it do? Turn you all into fire-breathing dragons! Side effects may include scaly skin, hot tempers, and dry mouth... You know, from the fire and all. Ooh. This will make the fortress obsolete. Yeah, we'll defeat the dark wolves, no problem! I'm not so sure about this. Grey, remember. Last time, when she turned you into a ram? Ow! Why? Oops, must've slipped. All right! Who wants to taste test? Uh, I'll try it! Are you crazy? Don't go near that stuff! It's probably... Ow! Oh, poor pup, why so grumpy? Oh, I'm so sick of this! First we integrate species and now any squirrel, rabbit, or snail can come in here and boss us around. Out of my way! Anyone? Less likely to kill you while it's warm. Come on, Grey. So sick of you! Josey, your eyes remind me of the moon at night. Or moon cakes. Mmm, moon cakes. Big chocolate moon cakes. Oh, Josey! Want some soup, Josey? - Ah! - Mmm. It smells really tasty. Ooh. Josey! Josey! Say something, my love! Wow. I like a woman in charge. Me next! So if we eat all the soup now, we can defeat the dark wolves tomorrow, right? Not so fast. I don't know long the effects will last. It's better if we wait until right before the battle. Good idea. And I wonder who should guard the potion. Hmm. The strongest will. You okay, dear? Am I doing the right thing, having everyone fight? Maybe we should've fled when we had the chance. Is Gark really wrong after all? Aren't we kinda breaking the laws of nature? But would you be okay with living in a pack of wild wolves again and hunting? Actually, I'm more of a fisherman. You've changed us, Grey, all of us. You've proved that even wild predators, like us, can change and live like civilized sheep if we want to. And even normally helpless sheep can fight back against predators. I know we'll be able to win with you leading us. We could defeat an army of saber-toothed tigers, let alone the dark wolves. You are the legendary Grey, leader of the first united village of sheep and wolves. Wow. That was so epic. You're like Belgour, only my wife. Um, I don't mean you're old, no, I mean, you're wise, and your speech was so powerful, so inspiring! Grey, I'm serious. So am I. Tomorrow I'm gonna teach those dark wolves a lesson. What a romantic night. Don't you think so? Ah! You're always so silent. There's some mystery to you. I saw it right from the beginning. You're not like the other ewes. In fact, you are... You're special. I've never met anyone like you. I understand you probably hear it every now and then. And I'm just a plain ram. Why would you need me? Oh, you're hungry? Just a moment. Here you are. To be honest, I cooked this for you long ago, but never ventured to give it to you. I have two passions in my life, food and... And... Well, everyone always praises my homemade food. Help yourself. A chamomile pie and a clover cake. Oh, you don't like it, do you? Of course. Why would my ordinary pies suit such a beautiful ewe? I understand. Hmm? Ah! You liked it! Oh, I'm so happy. I'm so happy! I'll cook some more! I love your good appetite so much! Aw! You want some more? Of course, let's go. I have so much stuff at home. We were so enthusiastic about the food we totally forgot to protect the potion. - Wait! - Huh? Shh. Hmm. Huh? Hmm. I forgot the spoons. Oh, it's all right. Now we have plenty of food, so it's not gonna be difficult to stay till morning. Hmm? - Ow! - Ow! Friends. What do you see here today? A ferocious enemy, ready to end our way of life? The threat of danger just up ahead? No, that's not what I see. I see a family, a town of wolves and sheep who have come together in peace and friendship. Together, we'll fight against tyranny. Together, we can achieve anything. No one can take that away. Prepare the potion. Drink! What? No! Foolish mutt. You thought you could use the rabbit's potions to win. But I've had my own trick this whole time. Presto! No. It was you? That's right, Grey. The potion, building, training, it was all me. But why? Sheep and wolves can't live together. It's against the laws of nature. Can't you see? I was going insane having to live next to grass-eaters and take orders from them. Gark understands. He knows we're superior. - Skinny! - Hobbler? How could you? - This is your family now! - I only wanted to make things normal again. The way it should be. That's enough! No, everything's gonna be better now. Lock this one up. Trap all the pigs in the square. Tonight, we feast. Wait! What? No, I thought you said we were just going to re-segregate society like before. Separate never means equal, kid. - But we agreed... - We didn't agree to anything. I don't answer to you. Wolves don't answer to anyone. You, on the other hand, are a traitor, and traitors are worse than grass-eaters. Lock him up with Grey. I'll deal with them later. Unless they do it themselves. And find me that wretched hare. What have I done? What have I done? Hobbler, my friend, they're gonna eat him! They're gonna eat everyone! Oh, this is never what I wanted. Grey, do something! Why aren't you saying anything? This is my fault. Do something! Anything! Aren't you supposed to be a hero? - Yeah, right! - But you are! You're supposed to save us. I should never have thought Gark's way was better. Hobbler, forgive me. This is all my fault. No, it's mine. What? We should have run when we had the chance. Thinking we could stand together and fight... I'm such an idiot. Now everyone will suffer and it's all my fault. No, Grey, you're wrong. Well, you were right. But now you're wrong. Because if I hadn't helped Gark, you would have won. Everyone came together and built the fortress before I messed it up. Everyone came together as a team. And together, I know the sheep and wolves can still defeat the dark wolves. You're right. We were working together. We might still have a chance. No more tail between the legs. - Yes! - It's time to fight. Yes, yes! Great. What first? Okay, I deserved that. We need to find a way out. - But how? - Maybe I can break the door down. Not a chance. This is Belgour's shed. The door's really dense. We could use your head to knock it down. I don't think that... Oh, yeah, I probably deserved that too. Argh! It's impossible. Any other ideas? We need to stop and think. How is that going to help us? Well, we might actually come up with something. Like what? A magic spell? Sim Salabim? Ah! Uh... Josey! You tiny little genius! Mami's potion is still working. The potion, that's it. I know where we took it. - And? - And we can still use it. Even as pigs, they'll be able to beat them for sure. Good thinking. You and Josey get the potion. I'll take care of Gark. Are you serious? He's gonna kill you. I'll do anything I have to to slow him down. Let it be known... ...that ours is the only way. Wolves are predators, sheep are prey. It's simple. So, if the wolves stick to sheep, they become prey as well. But it doesn't matter. You're all filthy pigs anyway. No one disobeys or disagrees with the mighty Gark. Wow, such big words. - No one disobeys me. - What a speech! Just like the card said. A swift kick in the rear. - Shut up! - That's no way to speak to a lady. Oh? Is the Great Gark feeling a little angry? - Where are you? - Right here. Get him! Ooh, almost. Not quite! Stand down. I'll do it myself. You hear me? I'll kill you myself. It's a date, buddy. This is it. Now it's our turn. Ow! Grr! Ah! Oh! Ah! Mm-hmm. Ah! Come on. - Hello! - Grr! You gotta try these! Missed me. Over here. You're faster than you look. I've had too much practice running away from responsibilities. Ha! That's why you'll never be a strong leader. When a strong leader sees something unnatural, he destroys it. No. A good leader knows to stand up for what's right. Huh? Mami, move aside. We don't want to hurt you. - This isn't your fight. - Why are you even doing this? Dee, intolerance is a bad look for you. You should wear green instead. Dum, your hands knit such nice scarves. Why would you use those hands for violence? You could learn a thing or two about stitching from some of these villagers. Gustav, you love fishing, and so do many of this pack you see before you. You might be right, Mami. But what about the laws of nature? Wolves are predators, sheep aren't. Listen, I know what it's like to feel pressured into being a fierce warrior. All my life, others have seen me as a carnivore, a meat-eating fox. But deep down, all I really want to be is a botanist. And here, just maybe, I can truly, finally be myself. So maybe you guys can be what you want to be, too. Just give it a chance. What do you say? Yeah! Yeah! Ha! I feel sorry for you. You're filled with so much hate that you can't even let others find happiness, even if it doesn't affect you. No, I feel sorry for you. Your bleeding heart makes you sink down and protect the lowest of the low. Where does that put you? I'll tell you... Right down there with them. We have to fight for those who are different from us. That's the only law of nature I want to follow. Leave him alone. So that's it, then? You choose the weaker path? Give up, it's over. Over? No, it's over for you! No, not the potion! I'll show you! I'll show 'em all! Oh, hey, little guy. Buzz off! Good morning, world! And so, the great leader Grey once again proved that kindness is more powerful than brute strength, and brought the societies together. With their newfound peace, they were even more prosperous than before. And, of course, the beautiful, brilliant, clever and all-around amazing hare Mami helped rebuild the town and even teach more knitting classes. Oh. Oh, what would they do without me?
