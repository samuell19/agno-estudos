Hello. Hi. Should we head to the ryokan? Your Chinese is good. Thank you. How's your English? How is Mr. Charles? Yes? You know my dad? I met him a few times when I was little. So you are the owner's daughter? Yes. My name is Rika. I thought you were just a part-time worker. We don't have money for that. Yes, you don't. Welcome back. I'm home. Gosh, you've grown. Mom, you've met him before? Once at the airport. He was so little then. Hello, I'm Bo-hao. I'm helping out here. Don't worry, my hands aren't sweaty. I was just making dumplings. Dumplings? He made a lot. Where is his luggage? In the back. Come in. We're reaching the 13th floor. Mr. Huang, it's good seeing you again. Is everything okay? Why bring gifts for them? They have no interest in buying a failing hotel. You just have to trust me. If we can't hold our ground and sell this ryokan, we're done for. I think they are still interested. Or else, why would they keep meeting us? We've reached the ground floor. If we handle everything just right and convince the board to sell, we can do whatever we want. You can go wherever you want. Return to America or go anywhere. Your dad would have nothing over you. Jacky. Just take care of the ryokan. And leave the rest to me. I'm off to the airport. Straight to the airport? How about grabbing a bite before you go? We'll celebrate when you get back. Did the interior designer come? I used to work at a design firm in Tokyo. With barely any customers in a month, the more we spend on renovation, the more we lose. The blueprints you sent me aren't practical at all. But Mr. Charles has already agreed that we can move forward with this. Do you see Charles here? I have the final say. What are they doing? She's my mom's friend. She comes here every week to teach a class. Thank you for the tea. Teach what? Omotenashi. Thank you for the tea. I think renovations should take three weeks. What? I want to cut the renovation time by half. That's not possible. Nothing is impossible. If you really want it. Tell them to take their class somewhere else. Starting tomorrow, they are not welcome here. What is this? Give them some time. If we cannot save this ryokan, it will have to be sold. I don't want that to happen. I know you don't want it either. Do you need someone to translate? I need time to think. What's wrong with that guy? Careful! That plate is expensive. Don't break it. I've never met anyone so rude. "Do you need someone to translate?" Ridiculous. He thinks he's better because he can speak English. He's quite like his dad when he was young. Who? Jacky and his dad. Why did Dad befriend that kind of person? I actually got to know him first. Who? Jacky's dad. But why all of a sudden? Even the closest of friends wouldn't use cash to buy such a worn-out ryokan, right? If Dad were still alive, what would he think of all this? How are you? Good. When did you arrive in Kyoto? Yesterday. Yesterday? You came for work? I started taking over my dad's business. Really? What? You were on really bad terms with him back then. Back then? Still am. Excuse me. So what are you going to do with the ryokan? I came to supervise the renovation, but I think it's easier to just demolish it. But you said it was built before the wars, right? There aren't many ryokans with gardens. If it's well renovated, it can be nice, no? It's cheaper to just take the whole thing down. Something new to attract more guests. You think? Look at this place. Were you interested in this kind of thing before? What? What... What? What's wrong? Okay, what is it? I am... getting married. On Christmas day. We checked tons of wedding venues here. But... With whom? Someone you don't know. Of course. That's not what I mean. Japanese? Okay. Congratulations. I was going to send you an email about it, but... But... Don't look at me like that. Fine. Sorry... No, it's my pleasure. - Thank you. - Thank you. How much did he drink? Should I carry him up? No, leave him. Let's go. I want... - Bus... - You'd like to go by bus? Bright Moon Hotel. Mie... Mikan? You want to go to Mikan Hotel? - Bright Moon Hotel. - Nikitayi? Nikitawi... What are you saying? Thank you. How long has it been? Five years. Time flies. It sure does. Rika has really grown up. But she can't seem to find a husband. I'm sure she has a boyfriend. Is your work schedule okay? I'm sorry. It's nothing. It's only a week early. Rika forced you to come, right? Rika sounded as if she was going to cry. This child is like that. Out of nowhere, she takes action. Much like you, yes? Children and parents are alike in peculiar ways. So what happened? Go ahead and tell me. I'm here to listen. - No problem. - Thank you. You're welcome. You are back. Welcome back. Weren't you coming next week? Why don't you take a seat? This is Bo-hao's mom. Wait, you don't understand Japanese. Mom. Bo-hao's mom. I'm Bo-hao's mom. Your dad saved me at the train station. I thought he was flirting, offering me a ride. I didn't know he was the boss until we arrived. Do you know my son loves Japanese manga? What's that manga you like? - Orange something? - Mom... Enough! I apologize. Rika contacted me because she was worried. This place, Mitsuko and Rika. Frankly speaking, it was Rika's granddad who built this ryokan. For generations, their family has taken care of this place. It loses money every month. If you don't consider future possibilities, - a solution can't be found. - What possibilities? Since coming back to Taiwan, all I've heard is "cost down." Isn't that why you sent me here? I never said that. What are they saying? Mom, hold on. Mom, let me show you my room. - Let's go. - No. I'm very grateful to Mr. Charles for saving our failing ryokan. Jacky too. I can understand your frustration. But... I hope you don't judge everything based on what you see on the surface. You're being too general. I'm not following. Please understand the culture that's rooted in this ryokan. The monthly utility bill is 300,000 yen. How did you pay for that? The same goes for the hot spring. You're just burning money. You can't even control these costs. And you want to lecture me? Jacky. What is your plan with this place? Do you want to revive it or destroy it? Mr. Charles, let's be open and honest. Jacky told me, "If we can't save it, we are going to sell it." So it's hard for me to believe he truly wants to save this place. My dad devoted his life to this place. Actually, I want to change the original plan. To renovate it inside and out, restore its former glory, and transform it into a ryokan that holds wedding ceremonies. What? To expand the customer base. - Weddings? - Here? What? - Are you stupid? - Mom, have some more. Are you serious? We'll finish the renovation before Christmas and host our first wedding. Christmas? That leaves us only one month. And hold a ceremony for whom? I already found our first customer. You just said we shouldn't waste a single penny and now you want to speed things up. What's your plan then? How long have you been back? What have you done? This hotel's situation is getting worse every month. - That's why you need my dad's help. - Stop it, both of you! Even though I don't understand... Sorry, Mi. Jacky wants to turn this place into a wedding venue. Weddings? - Right. - Here? Yes, here. Isn't that a fine idea? Mom, you can't be serious. The ship is sinking anyway. It's better to go down with some fanfare, right? This is what I always admired about your mom. Rika, what are you so worried about? What am I worried about? We have never held a wedding before. We have no idea how. I've already considered the extra costs of the personnel. We'll use contractors. That way, customers have more options. You mentioned contracting out, but shouldn't everyone have some training in hospitality? Then let them get training in hospitality. How? Hire a professional to teach them. Easier said than done. Is there such a person? There is. Who? The instructor who comes every week. - But that instructor... - Right. Ms. Kimura. Before she came here, she worked as a hotel consultant. Really? She argued with her supervisor and quit. Looks can be deceiving, she's actually quite tough. She's talking about the instructor who teaches here. Isn't that perfect? We can hire her students to work for us. Anyone with time to take a class during the day is probably looking for work, right? If that's the case, then you should learn too. You should learn too. Learn what? Omotenashi, hospitality. Me? Your daughter has got some guts, telling Jacky to take the class. This sounds fun. This is not funny. Jacky, do you understand Japanese? Rika, you should attend the class too. - What? - You suggested it, right? Asking the CEO to take classes. He's paying you, so you should go too. I don't want to. You don't understand the spirit of Japan either. This is a good opportunity to learn. You and him both should take the omotenashi class. Then, me too. Then it's decided! Okay? Welcome, ma'am! - Welcome. - Thank you. - It has been a while. - Wonderful to see you. Omotenashi, Hospitality What do you think "omotenashi" is? Is it superior customer service? How about you? She's asking you what "omotenashi" is. You get what you pay for. Well, it's a correspondence based on its consideration. Where is the heart of "omotenashi"? You won't find anyone in Japan who can verbally tell you the answer. If you want to know, you'll have to feel it. But then, if you ask me, is feeling enough? That's still not enough. Tea ceremony. Calligraphy. Archery. Everything has its "way." First, you have to learn the "form." Today, we will start with learning the basic form of receiving guests. This will be the agenda for today. Stand up straight. Not straight enough. And please don't step on the line. Good. Now, I will start by saying a phrase. However, please repeat after them. Repeat after me. - Welcome. - Welcome. - Welcome! - Welcome. - Welcome! - Welcome. - We really welcome you! - We really welcome you! - Welcome. - Welcome. - Welcome. - Welcome. Lower. Don't raise your head unless I say so. Don't raise your head. Good, again. - Okay, again. - Welcome. - Welcome. - Welcome. - We really welcome you! - We really welcome you! I can offer the venue for free. Why free? It'll help sell the ryokan if a wedding has been held already. Really? I've ordered them to complete renovation work before Christmas. But there isn't enough time, right? Do you have to pay a cancelation fee? Why don't you talk to your husband about it? Hey. Like you said, it was just bad timing and... And? And... renovation will start soon. You're welcome to visit and have a look anytime with your husband. Bye. We will keep the door in the middle, but everything else will be replaced. He said we will replace everything except this door. - Everything? - Yes. This is great! It's nice to know that there are still traditional ryokans around. Thank you very much. After the renovation, this all will become glass. And we'll take down this wall. We can sit over 50 people here. We can sit around 50 people here. Really? Fifty? You can see the garden here after the renovation. Garden? Take a look at this. - It's beautiful. - Here? Take a closer look. Very nice. - We are around here... - Right. Just want to confirm. Free... Here will be fine too. Pay attention to the interaction between the sales associate and the customer. Next up, use no more than 1,000 yen. You have to use 1,000 yen to buy a gift for someone you care about. Present it during the next class. The keyword today is "purpose." Think carefully about the purpose of your gift. - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am. Next time, I look forward to hearing all about your gifts. Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Excuse us. - Sure. Let's go there. Can I have a word? I've been observing the three of you and your attitude during the class. To be honest, you three have surprised me with the number of problems you have. So I asked a friend of mine to show you the fundamental basics of service. You three will be apprentices for a day to physically grasp the true meaning of hospitality. Do you understand? Good morning. We'll be helping you with your move today. - Please advise. - Please advise. - Please come in. - Thank you. Not like that. Pull this way. Then you do it. I'll leave the rest to you. Please take these new socks. - You can't sit like that. - Sit sideways. Excuse me, may we take our lunch break? - Please do. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - Please. - Let's rest. I really don't understand it at all. Floors are supposed to get dirty while moving. Just have someone clean them up after. Ms. Kimura totally has it in for us. I don't see how this relates to omotenashi at all. You should pay more attention in class like Bo-hao and me. I'm sorry. I must be wrong, but you texting your boyfriend is exactly why we're being punished. He's not my boyfriend. Boyfriend or love interest, I don't care. But I know what I saw. Who? You don't understand anything. What don't I understand? Everything you have is because of your dad. What have you ever accomplished by yourself? If you were doing so well in America, why did you come back? I heard that your restaurant in New York failed. Your dad told me. Rika. Bye. I'm so tired. Tanaka! - Mi, it has been a while! - Nice to see you. It has been a while. Is it really you, Charles? You think he has changed? Are you well? Can it be? Is this real? - He's a big boss now. - I cannot believe it. Is there anyone else we know coming? Yes, Suzuki and Tsukagoshi. This way. Suzuki, Tsukagoshi! Sorry to interrupt. Today is the rowing club's 50th anniversary. I'm glad that so many people showed up. The original agenda was to have everyone come up and give an update. However, since everyone is so old now, I'm afraid we can get too talkative. So I think we'll just select a few people to speak for all of us. Why don't we start with Charles! Well... My Japanese is not as good as it used to be, so please excuse me if I say something funny. After graduation, I've come to Japan on numerous business trips. I've been to Tokyo and even Biwa Lake. Every trip to Japan reminds me of our old days in the rowing club. The funny thing is the memories that really stick with me were the nights cooking ramen instead of the races. What amazing ramen that was. It was just plain ramen but so delicious. As we all get older, I've come to believe that in our lives, we will only encounter people we need to encounter no matter how far away we started out from each other. There may be some people who do not like me. There certainly are such people. I really believe that the reason you are all in my life is because we were destined to meet. Thank you all for being in my life. I'm grateful for each and every one of you. Thank you. -Rising mist evaporates -Rising mist evaporates -Ripples come and go -Ripples come and go -To Shiga, this place -To Shiga, this place -We bid farewell for now -We bid farewell for now My coworkers and classmates will sit here. No, this isn't okay. We can't seat them at the same table. Why not? Iijima and Takeuchi dated before. What? But isn't Iijima already married? That's why it's not okay. No. So shall we split the table? Can you do that? Sorry for the trouble. So the name is... - Iijima and Takeuchi. - Mr. Iijima and Mr. Takeuchi. And the menu for the day... Can we change the menu from Japanese to French cuisine? Wait, why? Why are you asking? I told you. My parents think it's more formal. Really? I've told you many times before. You never pay attention. She's always like that, only thinking of herself. Then, what should we do? Okay? French. - Okay. - French it is then. He's asking us if we can change to a French menu. He wants to change to a French menu. Change, okay? - Okay. - Okay. I'll leave the rest to you. Something has come up. - Excuse me. - Please. Good, French it is. The buyers are worried about the rising costs of renovations. So if they ask about the budget, talk around it and focus on the positive things. Okay, understood. In this market, you have to be unique. And Bright Moon Hotel is such a place. So please come take a look. In this market, you have to be unique. And Bright Moon Hotel is such a place. So please come take a look. We look forward to it. Please take us to visit sometime. Please take us to visit sometime. My pleasure. Hold on. What? May I have a word? Okay. We shouldn't let them change to French cuisine. Let's discuss this tomorrow, okay? Naoko decided to have Japanese cuisine. We've confirmed with the chef already. Aren't we supposed to put ourselves in the customer's shoes? How are we going to explain this to the chef? Then you have to tell the chef. Fine. You have to tell him in Japanese. Bright I've never rowed before. I want to try it. Then let me arrange it. Really? I heard from your mom that you want to open your own hotel. Yes. So I thought, "If I came to Japan and could stay in a similar hot spring hotel, I would be in heaven." So you came here because of that manga? Yes. Yes, I really think that it would be best if the hotel is close to the shore. Just like Bright Moon Hotel. In Hualien? If you go home now, I bet your mom would be very happy. But no one would invest in this kind of business now, right? Not necessarily. When you're ready, let me know. Who knows? Maybe I'll invest in you. Are you serious? Then I must hurry and find the best location like Bright Moon Hotel. However, there are so many things to do. What is it? Where did you go last night? I went to research birdhouses. Birdhouses? Didn't Rika say she wanted to keep Bright Moon Hotel as it is? I heard that if you put up birdhouses, there will be fewer insects. 1979 C Is there anything else? Nothing. Every time I came here during college, I stayed in this room. I was just thinking that after the renovation, this place would feel completely different. Jacky. Come here. Come here. Here. Cut it. Amazing. See? Can I try? I bought a handkerchief. I see. What were you thinking when you purchased it? Well, my grandma likes red flowers. Did you find what you were looking for? If I couldn't find a shop with what I was looking for, I thought it was okay that it didn't have red flowers. I would just buy a different one. So I am very happy to find one with red flowers. Why were you happy? Because the shop owner made me feel she really cared. Next up, Jacky. I bought chocolate. And your reason? Because we only had a 1,000 yen budget. And I'm not interested in stationery. While with food, anyone can eat, right? There's no right or wrong, but... Have a look at this tuna. - Excuse me. - Yes. I'd like some tuna. Me too. Sure, thank you. We got two orders for tuna. French cuisine. I was wondering if you could... I was wondering if you could... I was wondering if you could... I was wondering if you could... - Wondering if you could... - Wondering if you could... I'm not really that into shopping. In Taiwan, I can buy everything I need, you know? Why are women so into bags? I wonder why. Do you like bags too? Are you going to buy one for me? - If you want. - You don't need to. You already bought that expensive hotel. I could never have imagined you would become so rich back when we were just students. Me neither. You were always wearing the same shirt. But you were determined to be better than those who were born with everything. Right? Maybe that's why Takuji and I became friends because he had those qualities too. Maybe. Who could have imagined he would've passed away so early. Yes. Is everything really okay? I mean what Jacky was saying, buying a hotel with no future. What really is the future? What? What do you think it is? Why are you asking this all of a sudden? Back in the day, why didn't you marry me? What's the point of asking this now? It has been decades. It's okay to ask now, right? Back then, I thought I understood everything. But the closer you get to life's end, the less you understand about anything. Does that make you feel confused? Yes. Sometimes. Men want to understand everything. While women, if we don't understand, we just let it be. That's why we have children. Is that so? Yes. Three months ago, I found out I have cancer. What? It has spread a lot already, so I decided not to do chemotherapy. Why not? I wonder why. Don't be like this. Life is unexpectedly short. Why didn't anyone ever tell me this? Hey! After you quit, everyone really misses you. Really? "Why did Rika quit?" Everyone keeps asking me that. Why do they ask you? I don't know. I wonder why. Is everything all right? What? Work. Didn't you quit because you wanted a change? It's interesting. I can be free to do things I couldn't do while I was there. Besides, it's our family business. And recently, we've been working with a Taiwanese company. Taiwan? Are you able to use your Chinese? - Yes. - Really? It's good to know past experiences can still be useful even when things are different. You were always dependable. I graduated from Mr. Okada. I see. I'm going to be a dad soon. My wife and I were going to give up. I see. I thought you would find out sooner or later. Thank you. Hey. What are you doing? Do you really want to know? I'm not interested. You're so negative. What did you say? - What are you guys doing? - She's drunk. I'm not drunk. It's really windy. Hurry inside. Let me help you. You ordered expensive wine. Then you asked to go dutch. What a cheapskate. You said you and your wife had no sex life. Liar. Why her? She's ugly. Who's ugly? His wife. Then it's good you broke up, right? It's not good. Why not? He lost nothing, but I gave him my everything. Everything? Aren't you haunted the same way? Who? She's drunk. Naoko. What? An affair? There must be some problem. - I don't see any problem. - For her, suddenly, you can buy anything with money, except for what you really want. Right? Rika. Let me tell you why Naoko is marrying that man. It's because he is dependable. He might not be as rich as you, but compared to you, he's much more reliable. Rika, that's enough. Bo-hao, I'm hungry. Let's find something to eat. Your hands are nimble. Did you forget I blew up a restaurant? When you were little, what did you want to be when you grew up? I don't know. Baseball player? An astronaut? I really wanted to be a manga artist. I can totally imagine that. I just love Japanese manga too much. I would even order videotapes of anime and make subtitles for them. Subtitles on videotape? Yes. How? There was a subtitle machine at my school, so I would sneak in after class, synced the two tape machines through the subtitle one, and subtitled line by line. You really are an otaku. In Japan, otakus are cool okay? Who are you fooling? I'm serious. If you don't believe me, just ask Rika. She passed out. You... should be nicer to her. After her dad passed away, she quit her job to help her mom. It has been hard for her. Do you like her? Who? Who? Sleep where and when you want. It feels amazing, don't you think? You'll catch a cold though. Dumplings. Do you want some? Do you want some? Is it good? Jacky made them. Liar. It's true. Yes. Hi, I'm here for the delivery. - Please hold your sleeves up. - Yes. - A little bit more this way. - Sorry. - Ready? - Let's move it a bit more. - Let me. - Thank you. May I ask why you become an omotenashi instructor? Why? That's a good question. Is it because you like to take care of guests? I think it's because... I am easily afraid of people. Easily afraid of people? I'm afraid of many things. But when I can care about every detail, it's a lot more relaxing. Thinking about the needs of others is sometimes easier than thinking about your own. Finished. You are all set. - Thank you very much. - Sure. You all look nice. Thank you very much. Now then, please sit down. Are you three ready for the master class in Gion? Yes. I'm so nervous. There's nothing to be nervous about. However, there is one thing you have to keep in mind. In Kyoto, if the host asks if you want porridge, it means that they hope you would leave soon. Do not happily accept and eat it. The teacher said when we go to Kyoto, if the host asks if we want to eat porridge, it symbolizes their wish for us to leave. We can't really say yes and eat it. What a headache. Sometimes, the Japanese are kind of two-faced. Thank you for coming on such a cold day. Thank you very much. I have already heard from Ms. Kimura. Thank you for seeing us with your busy schedule. I do not really have anything to teach you. This ryokan was passed down from my father-in-law, so I moved here from Tokyo after I got married. It's an honor to learn from such an established ryokan master. We are really grateful. You are too kind. Here you go. Thank you. So you work together at the Bright Moon Hotel? - Yes. - Yes. Is that so? It's really great that young people like yourselves share the responsibilities of running a ryokan. It's not that big of a deal. It is a big deal. I have two children, a son and a daughter. Both left here for Tokyo. They never wanted to inherit this family business. So it's a pity that we'll eventually have to close this ryokan. Is that so? This is such a wonderful ryokan. If one day I save enough, I would want such a place. Thank you. Thinking back, I've always wanted family members or my children to inherit this place. But that may not be the best for everyone. After giving it more thought, if something you treasure begins to change, it can be scary. However, I might just let things change. What will change or disappear is meant to change or disappear anyway. I'm so sorry. I have prepared lunch. I will go and get it. - Thank you. - Thank you. Excuse me. This is Tai-porridge. Here you go. The lunch was amazing. - Yes. - Really? Wonderful. The utensils are beautiful too. This is Kiyomizuyaki. Kiyomizu. Kyoto pottery. This paint is beautiful too. You can't really tell it has been repainted several times. It looks new, right? But it is actually quite old. I see. Now that you have the porridge in front of you, you all should get going. It really is porridge. She wants us to leave. I'm just kidding. Ms. Kimura warned you about the porridge, didn't she? Please take your time. Ms. Shimizu, I feel like you are like a character in Ozu's movies. My goodness. That's not possible. Gosh. Is it snowing? It's really cold today. This could be this year's first snow. Thank you. Thank you so much for everything today. But all I did was chitchat. I didn't teach you anything. You have been most helpful. Come back to visit again. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. You guys go ahead. I have to take care of something. I think... Maybe I should reconsider the marriage. What? We have been fighting a lot since we decided to have the wedding. Because of the venue change? I always discuss everything with him. But he decided everything without letting me know. All on his own. Why not a Japanese menu? This is a traditional wedding. Yes. French is not necessarily the best. Exactly. If we get married like this, I doubt if it's going to be fine. Sorry to bother you with this. I can't talk to my parents about this. Thank you. It's sweet fish. You're really good at this. - Pose! - Okay. Sorry to keep you waiting. This way, please. Please. How about if we pull your hair back on both sides? Can we take a break? I'm so sorry. It's all right. You must be tired from all this. I've never been married, but it seems the brides are always so tired on their big day. Rika. Yes? Can we talk? It's very sweet. Myoga. - Myoga. - Myoga. I've never heard of it. I don't know this. Do you like Charles? What? You, Charles. Me, Charles? If I had never met you, I don't know where would I be Teresa Teng. Do you know of him and me? I kind of guessed. We broke up a long time ago. I was going to turn down his offer. But he said this will be the only wedding held before selling off the ryokan. And after seeing the ryokan in person, I couldn't forget how beautiful it is. Selling it off? If I'm going to call everything off, I really don't know what I should do. I'm sorry. I feel bad for having you all work for free. I'm sorry. What do you mean by "free"? The wedding. And call off what? The wedding. Hey. You're back. Cheers to the new start of Bright Moon Hotel. - Cheers! - Cheers. Cheers. And when are you coming home? Soon. A big thank you to everyone for helping me make the impossible happen. I'm really happy. She's really happy that Bright Moon is reborn and wants to thank everyone. Thank you, Charles. You're welcome. Thank you, Bo-hao. The pleasure is all mine. - And thank you, Jacky. - You're welcome. Why should we thank Jacky? Why not? Because he's a liar. What's wrong? How could you do this to us? What happened? Mr. Charles, what are you going to do with this hotel? After the wedding, you are selling it, right? - What happened? - What is she talking about? I don't know. You don't know? You lied to everyone here. What's going on? Rika, explain what's going on. From the beginning, he planned on selling this place. Rika. The renovation and the wedding are just to attract buyers and get a better price. Are you awake? Yes. The medicine has kept you sleeping. I see. Until a few minutes ago, Jacky was here, but I told Rika and him to go back. Tomorrow is another busy day. There is nothing for them to do here. I'm sorry. During times like this, men can't really help much. You're right. Don't worry. I'm so sorry. I asked Jacky to call your wife to come and pick you up. No. No? No need. Why not? I just want to stay here. Stay here? But you can't stay here forever. It's okay, right? It's almost the end. Huang. You only have yourself to blame. How much does my dad know? Jacky, you're free now. We'll give him a few more minutes. - Okay. - Okay. Hey. What are you doing here? I just wanted to see you. I'm marrying in two days. What are you thinking? I still love you. Have you actually thought this through? What I really need? To cherish someone is to put yourself in their shoes, right? Even if you can't see or speak to them. Can you do that? Biwa Lake - It's time for us to go. - Okay. Thank you all for visiting me. - Not at all. - Not at all. - Excuse me. Farewell. - Excuse me. - Take care. - Take care. What were you thinking? From whom did you get this personality? Your mom? How would I know? If you are like your mom, I guess I don't really understand her. Huang held a board meeting earlier this morning. But he knew you were in the hospital. Huang will probably come and sign the deal tomorrow. To sell the ryokan. Everything has gone according to his plan, hasn't it? I trusted him. Me too. It's just that with Huang... He said he doesn't mean to deceive me. But I think he just got a little scared. Scared of what? The time we have left is short. Jacky. A life without regrets isn't a life at all. What are your regrets? My regrets... I guess I'll think about them after I'm gone. I'll leave them to you. We usually don't appreciate our parents until it's too late. Have a safe trip. - Here. - Thank you. I'm off. Bye. - Take care. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. The original plan for this ryokan was just a basic renovation. But in this past month, after working closely with the staff of Bright Moon Hotel, I understood its change and value. Most importantly, I understood the meaning behind the ryokan is more than what's seen on the surface. The original plan for this ryokan Jacky, what are you going on about? I told you that this deal is done. Charles. I want to eat sushi for some reason. I'll take you. You'll catch a cold. Yes. When I was little, my parents were usually busy working. So when I got bored, I would come out here alone to throw rocks into the lake. One day, my dad found me and told me, "You can't do that." He scolded me. He said, "Lakes, trees, grass, and flowers. They all have spirits residing within them. We must respect them." We're not selling the ryokan. Honestly, I was hoping someone would destroy it. What? I was hoping someone else could come and destroy this place. Because I couldn't bring myself to do it. However, everything is all right now. Right? Yes. Feel free to use the slippers. - Welcome, please use the slippers. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Congratulations! - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - I'll leave the rest to you. Smile, please. Yes, sure. Okay. I understand, but I can't make that decision. Can you hold on for a second? Bo-hao, the customer has too many requests about breakfast. Remember hospitality. Hello, how are you? Yes. I'm so sorry. Yes, no problem. Is there anything else? Yes, we'll prepare for that. Yes. Okay. Bye. You have to put yourself in the guest's shoes and not make it harder for them. Okay, I will go and prepare. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your support. Give me a second. Should you bring back any gifts? Please hold the handrails and step firmly on the escalator. Hey. Yes, I just got back. Mom. Membership
