SRIMULAT IS A LEGENDARY COMEDY GROUP. FOUNDED BY TEGUH SLAMET RAHARDJO IN SOLO IN 1950. THE NAME WAS TAKEN FROM THE NAME OF HIS WIFE, RADEN AYU SRIMULAT. IN THE '80S, SRIMULAT WAS POPULAR IN CENTRAL AND EAST JAVA. IT HAS BRANCHES IN SEMARANG AND SURABAYA. COMEDIANS WERE BORN AND JOINED IN THIS GROUP. THE STORY BEGINS ON ONE IMPOSSIBLE NIGHT. Stop. Try to feel it. The music doesn't match. I need music that makes me fall in love. -Okay -Alright. Uncle Teguh! How about my singing? I've memorized the song. You go home. Take a shower. I already memorized it! Why didn't Aris join the practice? I don't know. He is your son. He's a member of Srimulat, huh? Why do you ask? Of course not. It was impossible for Srimulat members to put up flyers. Can't Srimulat members help put up flyers? I never saw you on the Srimulat stage. -Have you seen him? -Maybe he's an extra. And he plays the role of a tree. There's no way a skinny person like him could become a tree. -Then? -A napkin. Maybe when I'm on stage, your eyes will twinkle with a napkin! Good! You have to fight them! If your face is ugly, you have to be funny. Don't just lose. Are you a Srimulat member? Yes, I am. Watch out! Your beauty can fade! Important news. Reported from Jakarta. The decline in world crude oil prices devastated the Indonesian economy. The rising rice prices also make the people of Indonesia in need some entertainment. If you're talented, show it off. Otherwise, you'll be a napkin. Basuki! Come on! Basuki! Basuki! Do you understand what Basuki said? -Got it, Dad -Don't do that. Why did the security guard have to do the night watch? The night is dark. The flashlight is also dim. Should I put in the river stone so it doesn't dim? Damn you! Why are you applauding me? You think I'm a dove? -What's wrong? -The swing has no brakes. This is a dove friend. -Why is that? -Because you are Tarzan. You're an animal friend. You mean she's an animal? -She is beautiful. -Furry animals are beautiful too! How do you know that she has a lot of hair? Why are you asking me? Just ask your friend. You said he was your friend. How could you not know? All right, I'll show you my friends. Why don't you guys give a round of applause for the bunch of animals that come in? I'm getting more and more confused. Which one is an animal? So, which of you is an animal? Even the animals are confused! Damn you! This is the history of Srimulat's journey. Please have a look. What are you doing, Tarzan? Mr. Teguh is the founder of Srimulat. Just sit down. Excuse me, Mr. Teguh. These are shoes that flew onto the stage. Right. Srimulat is already famous throughout Java. Now, there is a guy who is disrespectful towards Srimulat. But the guy is funny, sir. -Whose side are you on, Bas? -I stand for funny people. You think I'm not funny? Sorry, Bas, Muni, Timbul. Sorry, Mr. Teguh. I was famous before I joined Srimulat. I don't mean to be arrogant, Bas. -Tarzan -What? The shoes just got back! Stop it! -Well, sir-- -Enough. So, you guys are feeling great? How many more times do I have to throw these shoes? To warn you! Life on stage is only temporary. If you get carried away, you will be eliminated. By whom? The people under the stage! The artist must be humble. Mom, there's a telegram coming in. I want to play football. Be careful. Aris, living like this is enough for us. Do you feel deprived? Look at yourself. Who are you? Who are we? Oh, God. Guys! There is a telegram from Jakarta. We are invited to shoot on TV. Srimulat is great! For now, only a few will go there. -The musicians don't have to go -Why? Mr. Asmuni will choose the players. -All right, sir. -Please read this. I'm definitely coming. You're coming, right, Djudjuk? I will sing. Of course she is. He says we will go on TV. Whose TV is it? I'll explain to you later. Right, Paul? Yes. TV. Even Paul understands. Why don't you understand? Arismanto, your debt will be deducted from your salary. So, you don't get paid. You, thin guy. I am sorry, Mr. Teguh. My son is unethical. He has no manners. Let him take responsibility. Come here. What you did yesterday, cutting off the conversation from below the stage, is no good. Don't do it again. -Don't mess up. -Tarzan. If you want to be successful, get on stage. Success together. You understand? -I understand, sir -Really? -Yes, sir -All right. Say goodbye to your dad. Come on. Say goodbye to your dad. I'm going to Jakarta, sir! I ask for your blessing! Mr. Asmuni, that guy is talented. Please help him. -Are you sure? -I have a feeling. Uncle Teguh, I'm singing in Jakarta, right? You come, but you don't have to sing. Now, Srimulat no longer uses accompaniment songs. Honey, why is the coffee a little bitter? I quit school to join Srimulat because I wanted to be like Sister Srimulat. Now, I carried out his will. To be the Mr. Teguh's wife. The kids are big too. What's wrong with you? Do you regret this? If I regretted this, I wouldn't have given birth four times. I understand. Yes, you'll join them tomorrow. I'll make some sweet coffee for you. This coffee is very bitter. Aris, I want to talk to you. If you want to survive in Jakarta, don't forget to mingle with other people. Understand? Okay, Dad. Take care. You have to be funny, Dad. Say goodbye to your dad. Honey, I have an antidote for longing. This is my hair. Is this real hair? Please take care of the kids. The car is full of my friends. Get another car. Peng, come with me. Tarzan's friend? We are like animals. We? Only you are like an animal. Srimulat, in Jakarta… Yes. …take care of your siblings. Don't be naughty. Yes, Mom. -Honey. -Yes, take care of yourself. I'll go there tomorrow. Get in the car. Don't leave me! I will be famous! Come on! Bye! I'll be following you soon! -To where? -Jakarta! THE CAPITAL CITY OF JAKARTA Mr. Timbul, what is this? -That is "Onde-onde". -"Ondel-ondel". Nung, you like to sing. You have to convince Mr. Teguh that you can sing. -How? -You have to practice. Come on. Give it a try. Wait! Lower your voice. Please down! What's wrong with you, sir? Nunung's voice, Bas. -It reminds me. -Of what? My dead dog. Aris Gepeng! Pengge Aris! Mr. As Peng. Why are you sleeping here? Because the sofa is comfortable. It is about your hear or the bed? The Jakarta-level swimming competition is being held. I really like that. -What is DKI? -DKI is an abbreviation. -D-K-I. -What does it stand for? D-K-I… How long is that? Ten? Twenty? That is easy. The starting line is at Tanjung Priok. The finish line is at Ujung Pandang. -You're dead, Nung! -Why me? You're the one swimming. Sorry, Mr As. I… Can I be part of the Srimulat family? Yesterday you wanted to join Srimulat, right? Right, sir. Now, you want to be part of the Srimulat family, right? Yes, sir. Then, what are you doing? I'm in Jakarta now. It is the result of my efforts, right? Drink up first. I give this just for you. Thank you very much, sir. How does it taste? -Like there are flies inside, sir -Of course. -Kabul, why haven't you showered yet? -We've been waiting for you. -Then, what's my problem? -Our problem! Just speak properly! I want to defecate. Read this to be smart. -Bas. -What? Damn! Why don't you water it? -Yes, that's my problem -Our problem! Because the water pump is dead. Bas, how old do you think the pump is? -It's still a teenager. -Why is it dead? Bro. -Why did you blow it? -To bring it back to life. They are your family. Try it, Nung. Now… How do you get yourself accepted by your family? -I can't sleep, Bas -Why? I have a lot on my mind. You live hard in the village, then you complain in Jakarta. You'd better die! -You're welcome -Miss. -I want to order Uduk Rice for my dad -Alright. Please wait. You don't have to think about it. Most importantly, you have to be ready to be part of the Srimulat family. But how? We'll think about it later. There's a pretty girl there. What are you guys looking at? If you want to see, be quiet. I don't understand Javanese. What? He doesn't understand Javanese. Translate it for him. Whose daughter is this pretty girl? -She couldn't be your daughter, could she? -Of course not. Her body is good, but this man's body is… fat. Her body is good, but this man's body is fat. I haven't spoken. He's not angry. -The girl is gone! -The pretty girl is gone! Are you upset? I'm upset because she's pretty. -So, this is his house? -Yes, it is. Go home. I have forgiven you. Just go home. -Sir? -What? The fat man is still here. Why are you still here? I have already forgiven you. It's okay. Just forget it. -Go home now -He's a little crazy. -You're a little crazy, huh? -Don't translate it! It's okay. Crazy people will not understand. Sir? That pretty girl. Who are you looking for? Is Mr. Makmur at home? He's next to you. Eat that! Eat that! I'm sorry, sir. -Why are you shaking hands with me? -You think today is Eid? -Sir. -What? Sorry, my friend is crazy. -Right, Peng? -Right. Sir, this is Basuki. I… Fredy. We didn't know that you are Mr. Makmur. We also didn't know that pretty girl is your daughter. I don't understand what he's saying. Translate it for him. Fredy apologizes to you. I can't believe it. He talks so much. They are members of Srimulat. They rent your house. Right? -Yes. -Yes. -You can speak Javanese? -A lot of Javanese in my office. Luckily, you rented my house. -If you don't, I'll beat you up. -Dad. Think about your health. You can't do the… -Now, you're old. -You talk so loud. -I'm leaving now. -Alright. Remember, eat the food, not the guests. Yes. Don't forget to drink water. Don't drink too much coffee. Yes. Excuse me. Luckily, my daughter is kind. Otherwise, I'll bite you guys. Why are you looking for me? -What, Bas? -I'm afraid of being bitten. -What are you guys talking about? -Nothing. I forgot. Excuse me. You want a bike? Bike? Who's looking for a bike? Try again. -Excuse me. -See? This is a rental, not a bike shop. Yes! "Yes"! You again! Why? I greet you. Yes, you're right. But that doesn't mean this place is a bike shop. Geez! Damn you! -Who are you? -Tarzan. -Then who are you? -Tarsiman. -What's wrong? -This man. This poor man, he is confused. Just calm your mind. Do not be confused. Stay healthy. Please come in. -Can I come in? -Please. Please. Please. Come on. Sit here. Please. Drink the coffee. Thank you. You are good guy. -This is good! -"This is good"! From a variety of coffee flavors, nothing tastes like this. -What does it taste like? -The taste of flies. -He likes it. -He likes it. I am embarrassed. It's okay. The guest is king. -Yes, sir. -Thank you. You're welcome. This afternoon, I met the official. He said he was here, but he had a stomachache. He said he drank fly-flavored coffee. The official had a message. -Please read it, Mr. As. -Okay. -"Dear… -What does this mean? -Mr. Teguh -Just listen. -But what does that mean? -Just shut up and listen. Mr. As understands that. Please continue. It means… -It is a greeting. -Right. In place. "With this… -Where? -This letter. "…we declare that Srimulat will perform at the front…" Are there guests? Just a moment, sir. -There's no one. -Didn't you say "up front"? I mean this letter. In front of the president. Uncle Teguh, I'll sing, right? -No! -No. All right, let's eat first. Please share the rice. Come on. I have to go to Semarang tomorrow to see Semarang Srimulat. Please take care of Jakarta Srimulat. -Okay, sir. -Kabul, what is wrong? You don't want to perform in front of the president? How about my last performance in Solo? -Not funny! -Not funny! If in Srimulat you're not funny, you're dead! Where's the side dish? -Isn't there a side dish? -No, you didn't cook? -I was cooking. Look at this. -Shut up! How long will you work? Is what I gave you still not enough? -Women have to be independent, Dad. -What? Don't imitate your late mother. She was an employee and often left me alone at home. Now, you're an employee too. But I prepare breakfast for you every morning. But after that, you go to the office. Then, I am alone at home. You work so you can buy stuff? This is a gift. It's good, isn't it? You said you were independent. Why do you accept people's gifts? That's different. Who gave it to you? -Checkmate. -Checkmate? I want to take a shower. Why checkmate? -Tarzan. -What? You're an artist. Why are you scratching your ass? Gepeng must be responsible. -Yes. -Hold on. Where is Mr. Makmur's house? This way. Let's have breakfast first. Okay! I'm emotional, so I'm hungry. I'm not emotional, but I'm hungry. Please. Don't be too angry with your friend. After all, he's your brother. So, calm yourself when you see Gepeng. Okay? Can you eat alone? You make me angry! I can. From what I see… Looks like you guys will regularly come to my house. This is uduk rice. The one who bought this was… -Fredy. -Fredy, Dad. Shut up. -He's "Onjaw". -What does it mean? Javanese ondel-ondel. -There are no ondel-ondel in Java. -Then, what are those two? Or are they baby ondel-ondels? Because there is a song about it. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. Then, who is this for? For me? I didn't have breakfast. Better for both of you. -Thank you. -Women never eat rice in the morning. They eat burgers. Don't think you guys can tease my daughter. You are different from her. She's an office worker, from Jakarta. Where are you from? -Solo. -What do you do? -Comedian. -You say being a comedian is a job? Then what is your job? Please ask the local residents, who owns the land here, that's me! The reason we brought uduk rice here is for you to fix our water pump. Stop talking about it. I'll change the pump. Here is your glass. Please drink. -What are you doing? Go to work. -Yes. I'm going now. Please drink. Okay, I'll eat first. You are coquettish! You always mess up when there's a male guest. -Are you all right, sir? -What did you say? Why did you give your eyes a drink? Are your eyes thirsty? I don't understand what you're talking about. Alright, you take this water pump. You take it to your rental. Understand? But you have to come here every day. What for? For drawing water to fill up my bathroom tub. Who's going to do that after you take the pump? Now, take it. What was he talking about, Bas? -Take it -You have to come here every day to draw water. -It's you, not me -What is "nimbo"? So, you meant "nimba". I don't understand Javanese. Damn. -It fell down -Good God. The pipe fell down there. You go down there tomorrow morning and bring that pipe up here. -You should go down there. -How dare you say that? -Salam, Father. -Salam. -See you later. -See you. I knew he didn't focus. You brought your dish here? I didn't finish my food yet. Bas, help me. Sure. Come on. Let's go home. Come on. -I don't like the mosque drum. -Why? He underestimates us. It happens to us all the time. It's not like that, Fred. It's "Aris" between the two of us. You said it was "Fredy". Yes, it was. It's different now. My father said if we want to survive the capital city, we must mingle in society. We must change ourselves. We must be like Royani. -Wearing a skirt? -No! We must become people from the capital. -Help me, Bas -Alright. So, that's the way you are. You're such a selfish person. Crook. Right, Mbul? Mbul, are you eating or pooping? I agree with your father. But your new name must match your face. -Fred! -Stop calling me that. -Help me! -Move away. It's done. You don't give me a chance to work. Turn it on. Here. There. -I have a message with me. -Tell us! Yeah, I am telling you now. Mr. Teguh said he's going to send someone here. Who is it? He's still considering it. Wait. I really don't understand. This man… You never understand anything. Timbul was right. Everything has to be talked about first, so that our fate won't be hanging on a thread. Right? -Right. -Our fate or your portion? Here is the thing, Kak Muni. About our friends' thoughts. Mr. Teguh must explain it first before sending someone here. He must have the answer for that. How does it taste, Nung? I think there was a fly. There was. Please, don't prank a woman. -Yes, ma'am. -That's not good. Today, we're going on a survey to a TV station. -The tower is so tall. -Right. How many days do we need to climb that? Obviously, we'll sweat excessively at the peak. It means we're going to perform at the top of the tower. What are you people looking at? Look at that. Titiek Puspa is so beautiful in the picture. She must be more beautiful in real life. Such a pervert. This is my luck. Think about it. Will I be like Titiek Puspa in the future? -Will she? -Impossible! Are you lining up here for rice? Do it over there! -There's a line for rice there? -Yes, you're riff-raff people. Line up there! Who are you? Sutopo. A TV employee here. Who are you? -Srimulat. -A guest star? -Srimulat? -Yes, I am. -Who are they? -All of them are Srimulat. Why didn't you tell me? Hey, Srimulat! Come over here. Quick! Forget it! Guest stars are not lining up for rice. Such a shame. Get in. How come it is locked? The employees aren't here yet. -Wait. I'll look for the staff. -Please. -Let's get in. -Let's go. -We don't need him. -Go on. -Peng, close the door. -OK. Where's the Srimulat? Ouch. -Salam. -Salam. -Gosh. Sir? -Yes. Have you seen the employee with the key? -Not yet. -Not yet? -Not yet. -Look for him until you find him! -Yes. -Yes? He said he was looking for keys. Something seems to be wrong, but what is it? What's going on here? A TV star. The one that appears on the poster. Different, huh? Her hair is so pretty, ma'am? That's right, Nung. That's Titiek Puspa. Yes, Titiek Puspa. Don't bother her. She's wearing her make up. Just watch at home, on the TV. You guys have a TV, don't you? Ma'am, we are aspiring artists. So, take a look what a real artist looks like. Where are you villagers from? Monkey mask group? Where's the monkey? You ask yourself? Insolent fool. Who is she? Her dress is like a rainbow. -Lapis legit cake. -Cotton candy. -Puspa cotton candy. -Paint shop. Mbak Titiek asked you. She said… -Oh… -Not yet! Are you singers or what? A choir? We are S-R-I-M-U-L-A-T. -What does it stand for? -Srimulat. Whatever. Just go away. -Good luck! -Thank you. Go away! Dear God. It's really good. Huge. Very cold. We have to wear jackets. There are flowers here. Do not touch. That's a star telescope. Good grief. Turns out you're already here. I looked for you everywhere. Have you seen the one with the keys? I have. That's why I'm here. Fine, let me explain to you. This is a recording studio. -Hi. My name is Gepeng. -Please get acquainted. Behind you are camera one, camera two, camera three. Those will record you to be broadcast to all Indonesian people. -To record stars? -Yes, and you are the stars. These are the stages. -You guys perform there. -Alright. One more thing. We will make billboards. Each of you will be painted, then the billboards are installed in front, like Titiek Puspa's. In front of the building. Then you will be more famous. -Do you all understand? -It's really good. Where does the audience sit? That is true. No audience. You just show up. The camera will record it later. You still sound better, Nung. -Because there's no sound. -It's enough. Let's eat first. The rendang must be delicious. Never mind. I'll pay for lunch. Can we someday be like Titiek Puspa? -Impossible. -Why impossible? Yes, of course. Titiek Puspa is basically beautiful. Try to compare it with Kabul's face. Nunung meant to say, can we be as interesting as Titiek Puspa, or not? Right, Nung? -That's the answer. -You don't even speak properly. We have to think about what can make us interesting. Nothing is impossible. Bas. I was born with nothing interesting. What about you? My mouth. Well. You accompany me, Bas, in search of… -Mouth. -No. Looking for something interesting. Perhaps charisma. -Kabul, you come with me, okay? -Go with you where? -You've got a mouth. -Don't ask too many questions. You want to be interesting, don't you? Mbak Djudjuk, we have to join the search too. Yes, women should not lose out. Man, I'm done. Where are the drinks? The drinks were left behind. Bul, we're drinking outside. Come on. -Come on. -Come on. FORTUNE TELLER Bul. -Who's going to pay that? -Use your mind. Never become a queer We must find something today. We must have our own characters. Can I see the shirt, please? Who installed the door here? -Execute me. -Excuse me. Mr. Sapari? Fatigue? Four boxes down. Monkey's kid? -Kowe. -"Kowe"? Speak Indonesian, please. What are you looking for? Miss? So, that's real. Enough already. Mbak, I'm looking for something that will make me look like an artist. -Who? -Me! You don't have the look. How can I be charismatic, Bas? Your face will not charismatic. You still have hope with your hair. -You want to have your hair cut? -I do. I'm glad. You are my first customer. -Not me but this friend of mine. -Okay. -Do you? -Yes. Excuse me. Are you comfortable? -What does this red mean? -Are you asking about stones or cards? If it's a card, one red means the queen. Five reds mean a pig. Stop kidding, Bul. You know my name is Kabul? -I'm Jambul. -My name is Kabul. Okay, this is just a misunderstanding. No need to fuss. -What does the blue one mean? -The blue one… -To boost self-confidence. -There he is. -For example? -To pickpocket, to owe money, also to steal, wear the blue one. San, this one is good, huh? Why did he change? What is this stone? -Why did my friend change? -Kidney stones. Sniff it if you don't believe me. -How was it? -It's like urine. This smells even more. Do you want to try it? Here's your drink. I'm really good at massage. It's not like that. Wait. -I'll give you an example. -Alright. -How is it? -Do it like this. Come here! -I didn't do anything. -You were distracting me. Geez, it hurts. -Is it painful? -Why did you have to ask? Shut up. What are you doing here? I'm looking for something that can give me a heroic look because I'm going to perform on the stage. -To perform on the stage? -Yes. -Are you a singer? -A comedian. If you need… Hey! You're not allowed to joke while wearing this uniform. This uniform is worn to carry out obligations, guard the country, and carry rifles. And you said you're a comedian? You don't even have the face. -But you're laughing. -Because you're not funny. But don't be discouraged. My father is a lenong performer and he once said, in his group, everyone doesn't have to be funny. But one must be able to make his friends funny. -That's it. -That's right. You may buy that. -Seriously? -Yes, because you're not funny and you don't have clothes? This is so cool. What kind of hairstyle do you want? You can choose from one to 16 or the top flat, round, ordinary or the youth type? Which one will make me charismatic? There are two kinds of charisma here. Ordinary charisma or special charisma. -How's that? -What's the difference? The difference is that the ordinary uses eggs. And the special one uses meat. -That's martabak. -Not funny. After all, why bother asking? -You want to shave or eat martabak? -Enough! Create a charismatic haircut. Ma'am, what is this? There's a picture of hair here. That's paint. What paint, ma'am? Of course, it's hair paint, not wall paint. Turns out to be hair dye. I'm buying the hair dye. It's expensive. Do you have money? Of course I do. -Really? Show it to me. -Look. Too fast. I haven't seen it at all. Look again. That's enough. I'm sure there's no money in the bag. How do you know that? This is for accessories only. I haven't received my salary yet. It's okay now. I'll lend you some money. Thank you, ma'am. The important thing is that my niece feels happy. -Yes, over there. -Take turns. -Okay. -I already taught you. One moment. Here it is. -Convenient, isn't it? -Yes. Try this again. Over here. Mr. Sapari? Who is this? He's a cloth trader in Tanah Abang. He wants some amulets for success. What do you want? I want to be successful too. Wear this. Only after that, you can have my consultation. Sure. Here. You know how to wear this now? I guess I need red to be bold. Then, the blue one to owe money. So, I want to be confident to go into debt. And dare not to pay the debt. Yes, that's good. It's a very easy hairstyle. Let me shave you instead. Come on. I'll shave your hair. -Come on. Sit. -Come on. Quickly. But he's the one… Just calm down. You just choose the hairstyle. Why are you powdering my face? So that your face shines. -I have a question. -What? -How much for your service? -One hundred. Not a hundred. -Then, how much? Please. -What about 400? -Give it to him. -He just gave me this. Are you finished? Not yet. To be successful, there will be many kinds of amulets. This one is for political success. This one is for romance. And this one is for… Not yet! Don't get ahead of yourself. Listen to me. This is for your success. I am the owner of this business. Don't blow it up. -Who is your employer actually? -This is my business. -Your business? OK, let's go home. -Wait. Thank God. -Thank you. -Thank you all. Insolent. Aren't you finishing soon? -What? -Aren't you finishing soon? No. Bro! These are amulets that can make you successful. But this has something, alright? -Conditioner. -Condition. -Conditioner. -Condition. Conditioner. You are crazy. It's name is Joyo and Kuncoro. -Joyo and Kuncoro. -It's the other way around. Joyo and Kuncoro. -Joyo and Kuncoro. -It's the other way around. Joyo and Kuncoro! -Joyo and Kuncoro! -Joyo and Kuncoro! Now, this is the spell. I'll whisper it to you. Where are your ears? -You got it? -I did. I didn't say anything yet. Have you seen Tarzan? Tarzan! Why are you looking for Tarzan in the capital? Go look in the forest. Tarzan! Be quiet. Show me your ID card! Be quiet Thief! Thief! Never become a thief Thief! You'll be in a mess You'd better be a queer And you'll get money from it It's better than to be a thief Hello. Soldier? Impostor! Hey, there's a fake soldier here! -This is a misunderstanding. -Get him out of here. -What's your name? -Mirna, a woman is not rude. What's your name? Kabul. Cabul, meaning pervert? Play dirty with us. My name is Kabul. Kabul. My name is Kabul. Can you read or not? -No. -You're all illiterate? Are you a thief? No, I'm not. I got carried away here. Take me with you. You can take me first. Can you do it smoothly? Yes, sir. Mr. Teguh. Your kids are so… Excuse me, Cabul. You just took a shower and washed your hair. Of course, I am crazy about this guy. That bald queer. Kepi, your burp was so manly. That's better. If you want to look more beautiful, wear a gincu. -What is a "gincu"? -Lipen. -What is a "lipen"? -Gincu. Let me show you. This is it. Damn it. In my place, it is called benges. -What is a "benges"? -Gincu. Stop it. You're stupid. So, in your place, it's called "stupid". Forget it. Just put that on him. -OK, let's put this on. -Take it easy. Now, do this. You're so beautiful now. Am I really that beautiful? Yeah. Hey, boxer, look at how beautiful he is. He's so cute. See, you become a person like us. There was misunderstanding, but after I explained it to them that I am Srimulat, the army understood me. -I also have a story. -Wait. Instead of all of you telling your stories and these turn out to be empty, let's see first whether we really have our food. Bul, check it out. -We have it. -It's not empty. It's clear, Master. Sir. Good. One, two, three. -We have our food. -Thank God. Let's dig in. Come on, everyone. What is this? Just soup. Nung, what have you cooked? Race noodles. Where are the noodles? You race to get them. You race to get them, San. One, two, three. -Almost. -Don't give up. This is difficult. There is only one. Where are the others? Lost in the race. Nunung, you're going to make us cry! Me again! -Sir, blow the smoke here. -Alright. My nose is clogged here. I was in a squabbling with the stone seller. Luckily, I had Mirna and Nancy to back me up. Easy, I'm not going to remarry. -I bought hair dye. -Who paid for that? Djudjuk. What about you, Peng? He wanted to get shaved, but he had no money. Is there really a good hairstyle for you? Timbul? What did you get? I can ward off demons with this. Ward them off or summon them? Miss? Mister? Your satay here? Satay… Dear Lord! Demon! My dad asked me to bring you this TV set. -It's been repaired. -Thank you very much. No problem. What's the problem here now? I forgot to bring the antenna. -I'm truly sorry. -That's alright. We're happy just to see you coming here. That's true. That's alright Little… -What's your name again? -Royani! Never mind. Why don't you tell us what shows are aired on TV now? There are many kinds, for sure. There is the news and you can watch music and whatnot. All of them are in Indonesian. Indonesian? Yes. Mr. As, why does it have to be in Indonesian? Srimulat's audiences are Javanese, right? We have so many Javanese here. Those who don't speak Javanese must learn. Right, Bas? Mr. Timbul? If you ask me… Nung? Kabul? Mrs. Djudjuk? Tarzan? -Now, you're dead -Not "you", Gepeng. -Peng. -Why just Gepeng? We all don't speak Indonesian fluently. You're dead, Mr. Timbul. You're dead, Tarzan. You're dead… You're dead, Nung. You're dead… You're dead, Bul. -Mr. As? -I am dead. I forgot to tell you all. I will perform on TV in Indonesian. All of you are just not fluent yet. So, don't be afraid. -Understood? -Yeah. Of course I'm not. What was that? Lord, have mercy! What happened to you? I accidentally broke the sauce bottle. I'm sorry, miss. He's not a ghost. Don't be afraid. It's alright. It's just one bottle. I'll compensate for this one with some satay. Just sleep on it, the Indonesian language. If we can't speak Indonesian, we can't live in the capital city. Right, Bas? -Bas? -Basuki is sleeping now. You're ignorant. Peng? Did you hear that? Gepeng is sleeping now. What's going on? Damn it. Such a chicken. This is a high-profile art of painting. So, I really need your cooperation. Relax. Do not move. Focus. OK? Not bad. Good. -Perfecto. -What does that mean? I don't know. Last night, I heard a sound from the TV. What do you mean, Bas? -Tell him, Peng. -I don't know. I fainted from the smell of your armpit. Maybe this house is haunted. Maybe… Don't say that. You scared me. -What is this? -It's OK. It's just Timbul. -What happened to Pak As? -His eyes are wide open! He is possessed. Keep doing that… The painter is leaving. Where is he? The swing is swinging by itself! Is Royani your only daughter? Where is your "garwa"? I don't understand what "garwa" is. Garwa is a soulmate. Excuse me, Dad. -What are going to do? -Take a bath. -You haven't taken bath? -I just got back from work. That's an old excuse. You must learn to speak Indonesian. So you can talk to my dad and to me too. -OK -Just take a bath! I am going to. Stop smiling. -What are you doing? Just fill the basin. -Sure. What are you doing? The bathroom is over there. There's no water inside. My daughter is going to take a bath. Look what you've done. Where is the water? You're just trying to be funny. Over here. What are you guys doing? What are you doing? What? The house is haunted! A ghost? -Look at that. -What? I am going to suck your brain. Why are you dressed like this? We went to Senen Market. I saw this costume and also these teeth. So I bought this. We traveled a long way to get here. -Right. -So, I have to do this treatment. -Your treatment scared us. -Coward. When we got here, the house was empty and the door was open. So we just came in. Wake up, Mr. Timbul. Actually, Mr. Teguh sent these ghosts. Come on, Mr. Tarzan. Just wake up. We know the ghost. We just fainted. We got more people, so I should get more money. No. This can't be like that. Just think about it! Do you think this is an easy job? You just sit and do nothing. We are going to perform in front of Mr. President. So we have to sleep well and rest well. We can't sleep well if there's a ghost here. We have to get rid of the ghost. Don't worry, Bas. I have the solution. Don't move! This is a masterpiece. -OK, then. -Raise your hand. What is it with you? Don't drop it. I am tired. So, you think we are not tired? -We are tired too! -Just calm down. We have to paint here. You have to understand. -You should know, this is hard. -Calm down. -Come on. Answer me -Answer him! MR. MAKMUR'S RENTED HOUSE The dragon lost it's head. Find it! Where did you drop it? Where was it before? Try to do it again. There it is! We got the head back. It gone again, Peng. Give it back again. Who called me here? -Who are they? -They are my friends. We are Srimulat. -Dear animals… -Friends! This is Mr. Sapari. He is a shaman. So, he is smart. -This is… -I know. -And this… -I know. -And she… -I know. -And next to her… -I know. I know, I know, I know. He is smart, all right. So, you know her too, right? Not that smart. She is… What is her name, Peng? -Royani. -Royani. -Royalti? -Royani! Did it change now? What did you come here for? -It is the other way round. -I came here? Right. Just tell me your problem. Just be patient! Speak in turn! If you can't be polite, I will leave. -I am leaving. -Please don't! Stop it. -Don't! -Stop it! Now, tell me. -Now, tell me. One by one. -Me… -Wait -Every night, I can hear the sound of… -Who is next? -Me. That night, I saw something white… near Pak Timbul's room. I have something scarier. Every night, the television set is light and on… Light and on is the same thing. I mean… It turned on and off, on and off… Then, there was a sound. My turn! Yesterday, I was… -He is possessed. -No. -He was born that way. -Right. Now, to chase away that ghost… I gave you the amulet, right? Where is it? That is Joyo Kuncoro. -Joyo-Kuncoro. -The other way round! -Kuncoro-Joyo. -Right! So, to chase away the ghosts, I have a potion for that. You have to wash your face with this soaked baby giant underwear. -That's underwear. -No! I don't want to! I don't want that, Mr. Timbul! That is kuntilanak! Tomorrow, Srimulat is going to perform in front of Mr. President. In Indonesian, please. Mr. President is going to perform in front of Srimulat. The other way round. -But are you sure about this? -Yes. Srimulat is so cool. -Do you want to watch us? -Sure. -Congratulations. -Sure. -Can I pick you up tomorrow night? -See you tomorrow. I have to go in now. -Assalamualaikum. -Waalaikumsalam. Have a good rest, Ro. -Send my regards to your dad. -Sure. -See you. -See you. Is it safe to park my car in front of the alley? Yes, it safe. -Thank you for taking me home, Jaka. -You are welcome. Well… What is this? Just open it. My God, this is so beautiful. -What if we go out tonight? -Lets go to Taman Ria. -Tonight? -Yes. I promised my dad to play chess tonight. I have prepared something special for you. It's OK then. We can do it some other time. -Bye, Ani. -Bye, Jaka. -Dear animals… -Animals again. Let's do the casting. The title today is My Village is Flourishing. You are the first to perform, Bas. You are going to be my helper who takes care of my rice field. -You are going to be a soldier. -A soldier in a village program. And Nunung, you will be a woman who is looking for your soulmate. -You'll will be with Mrs. Djudjuk. -Right. -Bul. -Yes? And you'll be… This is hard. What are you going to be? -You'll be a scarecrow. -My God. I think I'll be the farmer. Your Indonesian is not fluent. Paul, you'll be the landlord. -You'll be Rohana's husband. -Sure. Kabul, you'll be the security. You have to be firm and brave. And Peng… Where is Gepeng? This is the first time I play like this. This can be a stalemate. Your turn now. Hey! You are not focused! Women need time to put on make-up. Beautiful. I will not let her go if you are not going to perform for Mr. President. Your turn now. No. This is hard. These rice fields, mountains… Tomorrow. get me hair accessories like that. Just like Djudjuk has. Sure, ma'am. My future husband is a rich man, miss. Where are you going? The King can not move three steps. What is it with you? Come on! That's what happened. I am looking for my fiancee. I've given him my inside out. I've given him my whole body. Why do you have to do this? Are you having hemorrhoids? What is it with you? Now, you act like a bug. -Don't push me. -You like that. Mr. President did not laugh since the beginning. Peng… It's like playing dam. There. Your turn. Hey! Your move! My daughter can put her lipstick on her eyes after all this time. Bul? It is your turn now. How was my last performance at Solo? -You were not funny. -That's why! If I'm not funny again, I have to get back to Solo. What will I do in Solo? Before I left for Jakarta, my daughter said, "You have to be funny, Dad." Is she funny? -She is funny. -That's it. You have to be like your child. You have to make everyone happy. Try to remember that. I have to be on the stage now. This is a mountain, that is a mountain, and in the middle, there's a road. There are rice fields, the ocean, clouds, the sun. -All of it… -Belongs to you. Belongs to Allah. Don't laugh. Mr. President doesn't laugh. Sure. I LOVE YOU Where are the earrings? -Assalamualaikum. -Waalaikumsalam. We have a guest. What is it now? -What is your name? -Tessy Wahyuni Riwayati Hartati. -At ease! -Yes, sir! What are you doing?

You're still doing the casting, right? I'll get changed. -Peng. -Yes, Pak As? -What should I play? -You… You'll be a villager again. Go back to Solo. Pak As. I am not… I am really sorry.
