Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Cliff!.. Cliff! There's never anyone around when you want them Do I have to do everything around this house? Cliff! Ling!.. Ling! What are you, deaf? I wasn't in my room.. - That's obvious.. Did you hear a scream? Yes, that?s why, I wasn't in my room So, what was it? A murder.. A murder? Who? - Ling Where? Here, in Hong Kong in front of the pagoda.. I'm afraid they also broke into the pagoda.. Mr Bray, I haven't been able to find Ling It's not there, it?s stolen! Come on Joe, respect the dead.. They're mad, A great evil, a curse will come back now.. What kind of curse are you talking about? Hey Joe, what?s the matter? It's stolen.. Cliff, I thought that it was over When I buried it here I thought that we?d be free of it.. It gives one a frightening power.. I'm afraid.. What power? The power of China, her strength her symbol.. The yellow snake? Yes, how did you know? - But Joe, that?s only a myth.. The one who possesses it, on the day of the dragon.. On the day of November 17th.. Will win any war or battle, he begins on that day It's a vicious curse This time it could destroy the world.. Leave him.. - I'd better call the police I'll bury him myself.. Without the police, it?s better that way.. And I thought that it was the safest place to hide it.. Did anyone else know that you buried it? No one but Ling, but he would never betray me Perhaps he was more devoted to his colour than you think.. Just what are you trying to say? Just that my half brother Fing-Su might be interested in Ling?s death You should have some respect for him whether he's your real brother or not... I know that... You have the same rights in this house.. Although you're not my real son.. I see... Then I also have the right to try and trace the murderer.. And I'm sure he's the head of a snake... - You leave the handling of this to me.. And fly to London tonight, as we agreed I might find him there.. You wont find the head of a snake in London when the body is here in Hong Kong But the body only has strength While the head carries a deadly poison that it will spread all over the world unless it's stopped Cliff, don?t be a stubborn fool, my boy I'm warning you not to interfere.. I know China better than you do.. The yellow snake has been buried once already And now I'm going to find it, and bury it again Please go to London, and do what I asked you to do.. Cliff, this is my hearts greatest wish.. Since I am as sensitive as you, in matters of the heart, I feel obligated, I?ll go.. Mr Leggit is not here anymore.. No I'm sorry, I can't give him any messages.. Why not? Because he died last week.. God be with him.. Fools, all these calls are useless.. Some of them will go bankrupt I expect.. Cigarette? No thank you... And all this because your late partner Leggit, stuck you with at least 50.000 pounds in debts It was you introduced Leggit to me.. You must have been told.. I was not... I barely knew him.. 50.000 pounds of your companies funds, are missing That?s all I know about it Now wait a minute.. - Now but Narth,it?s quite simple Somebody speculated with the money, and did it in his name Mr Spedwell.. - We're down 50.000 pounds... I don't have that kind of money.. Yes, my finance committee has thought about that... They want to know how, and when you'll pay? But how can I know that? How can I say?.. Well I'm afraid that?s your problem, not mine But why haven't you gone to the one who can obviously help you? But of course, your first cousin, Joe Bray I've heard he's one of the richest men in Hong Kong.. To him,50.000 pounds is nothing, of little importance.. To you,everything.. Joe is not a generous man.. He would never... I don't see why he wouldn't.. He's been sending you money for years That 2.000 pounds he sends me every year, has nothing to do with the business Well, perhaps I can still help.. A friend of mine, a Mr Graham St.Clay.. - Friends are something you wouldn't have Friends about whom I've never spoken - But who is this Graham St. Clay? This was just delivered.. Oh,from Joe Bray... For you.. I'll read my own private letters, if you don't mind Of excuse me.. And you wont forget that your deadline is 2 days away, will you?.. Smoke? No! - I'll see you... Mabel.. Mabel.. Mabel.. Joan! Put that thing in the kitchen or somewhere.. It makes me nervous - Yes uncle Stephan.. Mabel... Joan, find Mabel and tell her to come here - Yes uncle Stephan.. Mabel.. - Why are you screaming like a madman? I'm sorry.. But we are saved, this letter.. Read it yourself.. Today is the fifth, you?re to be married on the tenth.. Is that so? Please, I'll explain... Just who is this Joe Bray? A first cousin of mine, a millionaire.. He lives in Hong Kong.. I haven't met the man, but he provides me with 2.000 pounds a year for Joan In fact, I owe my firm to Joe.. Why haven't you told me this before? Have you wanted for anything? And for this, I'm to marry this Clifford Ling? Mabel I need money, plenty.. Or else, your father will go to jail.. I'm to do this for you? Think again... I refuse to marry a foundling just to get his inheritance It will be millions.. Will you guarantee me Joe Bray will be dead soon? The man is 65 years old.. - Churchill was 90.. Please.. Mabel you are no longer 18 Perhaps... marriage... would be good for you... It.. would be good for you, and me.. I guess I can look at him.. Mabel... Maybe I'll like him, and maybe I wont.. You have another daughter, don?t forget about her She's weak enough to do your bidding But Joan is only my foster child.. Here, it says niece... Joan is the daughter of your sister, and your niece... Forgive me for interrupting your work.. But could you tell me where I could find Slater?s Cottage,125 ? Take a left, fourth on the right - Fine, thanks.. Another question.. Would you say I'm a gentleman? - Erm.. no.. No?.. Many thanks.. Goodbye.. Clifford Ling is a very good looking man.. A gentleman, he offers the possibility of a fine future.. You don't even know the man.. - I'm sure he's good.. Joe Bray wishes very much, that one of you marry him.. Your name by birth is bray,Joan.. The lineage should be continued.. Joan, I've been very good to you.. I've given you everything you could want It's cost me a lot I don't think it's too much to expect Uncle Stephan, to marry someone you don't love, is a sin Joan.. I'm only asking you to marry him If Mabel doesn't... Will this repay you for all your kindnesses? It will my dear.. How very careless.. In London, one should be a thief.. Now calm down and stop crying... But Joan, it?s just in case.. Nothing's been decided.. Please stop crying, he hasn't even arrived Yes, if it's me you're talking about.. You must be the girl I'm supposed to marry.. Who are you? - Clifford Lynn.. Then you're mistaken.. Alright,then perhaps this lovely creature Pardon... Clifford Lynn, I?m happy you've come.. Your appearance was a surprise.. Well, none of us is safe from a surprise now and then Yes... This just came for you.. For me? - Yes.. Here you see the next surprise.. And it's not even my birthday.. Did you see who brought it? - A Chinese.. You can open your eyes now.. It's dead... I'm sorry, I can't find your waste paper basket.. Well now, do you always give your guests such a welcome? I rather thought they would try to kill me with a dagger... Seeing as the windows there are wide open.. I'm going to have a drink of whisky It's very nice here.. Well, I?m supposed to marry someone.. Surely not you?... Me.. - Oh,alright.. Mr Lynn!.. I find your behaviour in my house rather unmannerly Ah,you're Narth.. I might have known, I?ve heard a lot about you Are you not the gentleman who uses others money for his own investments? How dare you say that! Let's drop the topic! You're here to ascertain if I'm an heir to Mr Brays will.. Yes, after he's dead.. For the time being, the old boy is still alive, and in excellent condition Well, I'm here now... But I'm a long way off from getting married to your niece.. At least for now.. I'm sorry, but I always tell the truth You must marry, quickly You better repair the hole in your floor first, I?ll pay for it, of course.. And I think you and I should take some time to get better acquainted with each other I'm looking forward to it.. What?s your name again? We weren't introduced... Joan... Joan? I thought all Joan?s were bitter and extremely ill natured Perhaps she's an exception.. I'll see you later.. And would you see that my best wishes are sent to Mr Graham St Clay, if you will.. I haven't heard of the man.. So, you haven't had the pleasure yet? Happy to have met you all.. I am Fing-Su - Ah but of course, please come inside Thank you You know me? - You've just introduced yourself Please take a seat.. Are you interested in my beautiful collection? Gentlemen come to me quite often, and want to buy things from me But I do not sell anything You see, I?ve grown to love each and ever piece in this house.. And they're like children to me And I could never never part with my children.. They are mine... I do not wish to buy anything I'm expecting someone here But there's no-one in my house, but me Though I'm very happy you came, if you're expecting someone else You'll surely be disappointed That's him now.. - That's him now.. That's him now? I'm sorry.. sorry Cliff! I'm sorry, I didn't expect you to look so unkempt.. I'm still a handsome devil.. And you're beginning to look older than your antiques.. Hey... Tell me, how have you been? - You might say, preserved.. I see, in this museum, yes.. You know, if I wanted to, I could sell everything... Then why not do it? - Ah but... Wait a minute, there was a man here who said he was expecting you What? - Oh there he is.. I welcome you to London, Cliff.. My gracious brother.. You certainly surprised me Please Mr Carter, forgive me my obtrusiveness It's my way of surprising, my dear brother here It's good to see you.. Yes, while you two renew acquaintances.. I will excuse myself.. And make us some tea.. Chinese, naturally.. Well, since you know I'm in London now.. I imagine you also know why I'm here? Yes, you are suppose to continue half of the inheritance of our father, with the bride of his choice... I hope she's a pretty one... As far as I'm concerned.. From what I've seen so far.. As for you, you look as young as ever - The eternal youth of China And your business is going well? - Fine.. It's unfortunate you're staying with your friend here I would gladly put you up.. The food is European and the maid is Chinese.. If I recall... You like both.. I'm sure I'll like it here.. This is guaranteed to be the very best tea, anyone can buy.. Gentlemen, your tea... Now, you must tell me why you are in London.. I came to bring you a present.. - Yes ? Do you realise what you've given me? Yes, a dagger.. Yes, a rare find.. This is the old and ancient sigh of Gwin-Sing Many years ago it stood for power, cruelty and a silent death The weapon of the fighting hand.. The ideal of Chinese world domination Isn't it curious that you brought it for me.. For I understand that there is talk of the fighting hand here in London Where did you get it? - I found it.. Cliff, you?re a lucky fellow Cliff! My goodness, I feel extremely awkward about this.. This has never happened before Mr Fing-Su Please forgive me - I forgive you, Mr Carter Thank you.. I was too slow.. If you want to stay with me, you?re welcome.. Cliff, I swear to you.. Nothing like this has ever happened in my house before I've never had anyone try to kill me I don't even know why.. Well, perhaps they were trying to kill me.. Yes, that?s another possibility China and love.. And the fighting hands.. You've saved my life Fing-Su, perhaps, I'll stay with you.. They wont try again, I?m sure.. Forgive me, I must leave Fing-Su... I thank you.. I'm indebted to you.. - You are my brother.. Well.. well what should I do now? Better close the window.. - Yes, a very good idea.. Ingenious isn't it? This is my protection, for my wealth and health I don't know how much you like your brother.. But he is very different from you... At the very least, he could have been much more courteous to you Especially, after you gave him such a gift.. Well after all, he saved my life, didn?t he? You're right, I see now.. You're so very right, yes.. And now that he's gone, I?ll make an English tea Beautiful isn't it? - Yes.. My most precious piece Ah yes, sometimes the simplest is the most beautiful.. By Eddie Samuel Carter - No, Tolstoy.. I'm sorry Mr Narth, you say you'll pay, when you inherit the money But the man is still alive, .. and your daughter hasn't married his son.. Until then, you cant raise a penny Give me one.. - Bad for your health.. Where'll I get the money? I thought you might ask.. So I took the liberty of bringing someone along, who might answer that question Please, come in... That is Graham St.Clay... This is Mr Narth.. You were expecting me to be English? - Yes... May I take a seat? - Oh yes, of course.. - Thank you.. I've heard that you're in trouble at the moment... 50.000 isn't it? 50,000 will solve your problems Please, take it... Thank you, I... A receipt? - For what, aren?t we men? How can I... well.. Perhaps you can do me a small favour Mr Narth.. Of course, with the greatest of pleasure This favour is not going to be worth 50,000 to you, nor to me.. Consequently, there will be several favours.. I don't know how I can thank, or express.. You have sir, saved me from a desperate situation You don't know how desperate I've been.. Not at all.. You will hear from me Mr Narth Good day.. No, I was just going to tell you that you don't have to marry me anymore.. Have you found a better bride than me? Joe Bray is dead.. Isn't one supposed to keep a promise to the dead, as well as to the living? You didn't promise him anything - But my uncle.. Your uncle will not be sad about it.. My uncle didn't know him at all.. Your uncle knew how much he would inherit.. If we had married.. Maybe I will marry you after all.. Only for love? - Yes... I never know if you are serious... Oh,pardon.. This is my sporting friend, Mr Carter Eddie Samuel, this is Miss Joan Bray - Good morning.. Since when do you use tomato?s to play golf? This is a little joke from a millionaire.. That means, since he is lodging as my guest In other words, he wants me to leave.. A shame, perhaps I would have been able to innumerate some of the characteristic idiosyncrasies of my friend on this momentous occasion I've already noticed quite a few.. Miss Joan is not in the least curious And now, good luck to you, in case you want to go fishing later Miss Joan, I hope we become better acquainted with each other And I'm sorry for my friends rough tones He's an overgrown boy Good day.. Angry?... Now tell me, are you more obliging when you're shaved? Perhaps... Hello my friend... A lot to sweep huh? Do you know him? He tries to make the world clean.. His broom and shovel will always be busy.. I don't think I would ever be bored, if you married me.. Thank you - You're welcome... It's been a pleasure for me, Joan.. - Goodbye.. Your fianc? would make a good servant Do you want anything? Hong Kong has sent a telegram, you can give it to my father.. Oh,you have a message, you are invited to a dinner Apparently, it seems the gracious lady is in demand everywhere Father will pick you up at eight, enjoy yourself... Father, Joe Bray.. Buried yesterday.. Mr St.Clay will join you shortly - Yes, thank you.. I'm pleased that you've come.. My dear Joan, I want you to meet, Mr Graham St.Clay.. A business friend.. - Shouldn't we forget business? You're enchanting, please.. Well if you don?t wish to talk shop, Mr St Clay, I should have no more difficulties, because I just got a.. telegram from Hong Kong informing me, cousin Joe Bray has passed on... Therefore, I can guarantee that I can, deliver to you, a rather large cheque.. Speak not of business, in the presence of a beautiful lady That?s what I like about you Mr Narth.. You're an optimist Are you married? - No.. Ahh, but soon.. I'll announce myself.. We'll set a place at the table No need to, because you're about to have one too many.. This young lady is my bride to be.. And that applies to one and all, including my closest relatives.. Don't be disturbed... I didn't know, you and Clifford Lynn were relatives.. I'm not accountable to you, in regards to my relatives.. Your first favour to me, Mr Narth.. didn?t amount to a pennies worth.. Please leave me alone.. And now we'll dine at a nice little restaurant, Wont that be nice? Who is Graham St Clay really? - He's my half brother Your half brother? - Yes, his mother was a Chinese woman.. She was a member of an old and respected imperial Chinese family That explains a lot, regarding his character.. Wasn't it rather rude of.. - Yes, he was.. Are you always as jealous as that? Do you always have to go to dinner with strange gentlemen? Or could you possibly get used to me? If I were able to see more of you, I might.. Would you run a bath for me? Lay my clothes out for me? Bring me my tea? And at night, would you sing me lullaby?s? What you need, is a musical maid She'd be less expensive.. Expensive... You are sweet.. You're becoming important to me.. I could even say... Come on! I thought you wanted to eat? - I thought so to.. But a short walk here, can also be very enjoyable.. Later on we'll get something to eat.. But now we'll walk, until we find our appetite.. Stay here and don't move.. Keep quiet and I'll be right back.. Looking for me? Tell your employer that I don't need any protection But he might need it himself in a few days! Here, look! Now get out of here! The third.. Now it's mine.. I?m frightened.. - For me? Now, what were we talking about? Ah yes, I was about to tell you.. You're sweet.. You lead an exciting life,Mr Lynn Yes, but not much longer.. Only till the 17th I have nothing to sell... Especially at night.. What do you want? Help!.. help! Why do you even think of marrying a person like me? Isn't it frightening? - No, not anymore.. Because I shaved? What kind of person are you,Mr Lynn? - My friends call me Cliff Cliff... And do you care? It's terrible, not a thing.. nothing! Scoundrels, if they had stolen anything.. Not a thing.. - Cant you sleep? Not any more.. They tried to murder me.. They made another attempt to murder me.. And still I don't know why.. Missing anything? - No,nothing.. Murderers, that?s what they were, murderers.. For your information, they never got in through the door They came through the window The window was open What can I do? If the windows not open, I can't sleep.. Yes I know, now calm down, and tell me calmly and clearly exactly what happened here Alright!.. alright,I'll calm down and tell it calmly and clearly exactly the way it happened I slept,awoke,saw two Chinese, and then.. Then, then they knocked me out.. I awoke, help me! Nothing, not anything Nothing stolen.. They didn't even recognise it's value Yes.. No my good friend.. If they had, they would have taken it with them.. Now my brother.. I'm going to pay you a friendly little visit... Follow that car, and don't lose it.. - Yes Sir.. Here you are.. - Thank you Tell them to get out of here - Scared? Fing-Su,I'm warning you.. That will be your last warning... I can think of nicer ways to immortality.. Get them out of here.. My loving brother, why didn't you simply ask, if you wanted to see the yellow snake again.. It would have been easier.. You know how my men deal with burglars? If you're smart, return the snake.. You nervous? Don't be so stupid, you?ll never get out of here alive.. I'm worried about your health and welfare.. Forget about the snake.. And leave the world in peace! Bring him back to me! Good evening.. Three visits in one night.. Isn't it too much of a good thing? You invited me, isn?t your home my home?.. brother.. What gives you the right to intrude upon my privacy? Your crimes.. - A crime to you maybe.. To me, a mission - A noble mission.. You break into houses.. Commit murder.. dishonour the dead.. You dare reproach me? This is sacred.. With the symbol of the yellow snake, I will gain power again It's the heritage of my mother, that I be victorious.. With the lives of thousands of innocent people.. Our father... - Our father is out of it.. He's dead.. I am no longer obligated to him.. A man's obligations to his father never end Even a bastard... And this bastard.. Commands four million Chinese.. And four million isn't six hundred.. If I have the yellow snake, they?ll all submit.. Give it back to me! I'm warning you one last time Forget about the yellow snake.. And the 17th of November, and your plans for conquest,Fing-su, or I'll break your neck! Brutality will only bring retaliation But I know how to handle, your kind of lunatic.. This is my last warning.. Fing-Su.. Clifford Lynn... I'll have revenge.. Miss Joan Bray, or Me,Mr St. Clay Your answer came all too quickly.. Those that answer too quickly, are thoughtless.. Since I met Joan yesterday, I?ve become interested, and I want to see her, and speak to her... alone.. And maybe, I?ll marry the girl.. - Mr St. Clay.. Obedience is the most important rule of the fighting hands.. And don't you forget it Spedwell.. You have enough slaves who will willingly, obey your orders.. Mr Narth would appreciate my proposal more, if it were presented by someone like you... An Englishman.. Mr St.Clay,one thing.. Joan Bray is a woman If something happens to her I'll... You have been paid to well, and done too little, Spedwell.. If you hurry, you?ll have time to meet Mr Narth at the office.. Goodbye.. Thank you Mabel, you?ve chosen many beautiful things for me.. If my father's willing to spend so much money to get rid of you, I?m certainly not going to stand in the way of the old fool.. I guess I shouldn't talk like that, do you mind? It would be extraordinary if you didn't The company of your fianc? does you good.. You've become quick witted.. - Thank you.. He's not stupid, he?s even courageous.. But it takes courage to be seen with him on the street.. Maybe I'll be lucky and find a good looking man under that beard We all have to pay for everything in life.. Even money.. That's impossible! The wedding to Joan, has already been planned and arranged He wants me to shuffle the girl around, the way he shuffles a shipment of washing machines.. Today she marries Clifford Lynn, and tomorrow St. Clay.. Consider her feelings.. Can you afford such considerations? Clifford Lynn will force me to explain, and I'll have to tell him.. 50.000 pounds is a lot of money.. - Oh he'll get that back! Now that old Bray is dead, we only have to get Joan and Clifford Lynn married.. Ah,this takes time, the reading of the will.. Then the settlement of the estate.. I'm a business man.. If Clifford Lynn marries Joan, I?m a millionaire.. Well Mr St. Clay is worth even more, you have another daughter.. Mabel? - Yes.. Bring Clifford Lynn to her for marriage.. Both heirs to an immense fortune, would be your sons in-law.. You said you were a business man.. A fine thing you're asking.. - Nonsense.. In the world in which we live, women are nothing more, than a figure in a bank account.. To be transferred, and manipulated at will.. The interesting part, is how it draws interest.. So what will happen? Not a thing... Except Mr St. Clay wants an undisturbed meeting with Miss Bray to be set up I'll have to persuade her.. No no, not necessary, Mr St. Clay will provide persuasion.. The only thing you have to do.. Is try to keep quiet and keep out of it If the girl stays at Mr St. Clays home for a few days.. Give me a cigarette! You know, you smoke too much.. The dream of young girls.. Mabel, you would be a beautiful bride.. Are you trying to remind me that I haven't even married once? I didn't mean it like that, I?m sorry.. Why are you sorry? You're right... You?ve found someone good for you.. I have to pick up my fur jacket at the furrier, coming? No, uncle Stephan will be home very early So I have to prepare supper for him It was very nice of you to accompany me.. If I'd gone by myself, I certainly would have gotten confused Women only wear a wedding gown once.. That's right.. or not at all,? bye.. - 'bye.. My Bride! Oh,Mr Carter.. - That is correct.. I recognised you immediately, because Eddie Samuel Carter, has only to see a face but once, and he never forgets it.. The only difficulty I have, is remembering names Because I'm always running into good friends, and I cant introduce them because I can never remember names Although the memory of numbers, has always been easy.. Telephone numbers for instance I meet this difficulty by introducing people by their telephone numbers, it goes like this.. Allow me 128,this is 1202.. And now, let me see, you?re name is.. Joan Bray.. - Of course, Miss Bray, that?s it.. Please forgive me my confusion with regards to names.. That's alright.. - Do you mind if I accompany you Miss.. Joan Bray.. - Oh,I should have remembered, I thank you Miss Bray.. At this moment I am very happy, and in this state I'm rather talkative Yes, I noticed.. Look at the exquisite treasure I just bought.. Third Ming period, you know of course, that I'm a collector of antiques.. My own specialty I the treasures of the far east Well here I am, walking along the street Minding my own business, when all at once, it?s my lucky day I've also doubled my good fortune by meeting you I must enlighten you about Cliff - Are there any horrible secrets? I believe a woman should always know everything about the man she's going to marry At least that's my belief.. Yes well, Clifford Lynn has two points hard to recognise.. First, he is nicer than he appears.. - A very nice observation Yes, but the second one is more important.. He hasn't the foggiest about Chinese art Surely you're joking.. He can't distinguish between the values of the Xing and Xian dynasties He thinks statues are handicrafts and takes enamels are late paintings Certainly a drag on a marriage - Yes,oh yes.. Oh,Mr Carter.. Can you put it together? I'm certain I can't restore it to it's original condition.. But if I were able to repair it, I wouldn't have these lovely bits of china to bring you good luck.. Inspector, As fine a vase, with quality just as good, as any vase that Tu-Fu ever made You are familiar with Tu-Fu,aren't you? A precious vase.. Mr Carter, I want you to explain what happened, point by point.. Point by point, I would be happy to inspector.. At 5 after 2 I left my house.. At 5 after 3 I walked into an antique shop, and bought a magnificent vase of china, and 5 minutes later, I purchased it.. Purchasing it was very costly, because of it's value Of course, go on.. At 15 minutes before 4,I was making my way to a taxi stand at Gordon street and 5 minutes later I saw the girl And 1 minute later I stopped the lady.. And 3 minutes later, it was broken, the vase as well as my head.. And I said, it was my lucky day... To whom did you say that? - To Miss... ah.. these names.. Well, who was this lady?.. - The bride, she was.. Was she your bride? Not my bride, she was the bride of my friend.. The bride of my best friend, Clifford Lynn.. And it was she, who knocked you down? Oh now inspector.. That charming young lady, why should she? Then why should she disappear? Perhaps you should tell me inspector, point by point! Good evening dear.. Joan isn't with you? - No, should she be? She's not back yet, and she should be.. She left me on Gordon street, and said she was going home straight away.. Oh,Joan is not here? - No! Oh don't worry Mabel... I guess our little Joan... is engaged on something special... Engaged on something special? why didn't she say something about it? Perhaps, she didn't even know anything about it, then Pleasant things can come as a surprise.. And you're full of surprises.. May I speak to Joan please? I see that you're still ill mannered, good evening.. Good evening.. - Good evening... I thought Joan must have been with you.. But... isn't she here? - No.. Yes, but it's a quarter past eight, where is she? I don't know! I'm not her nanny who carries her around She's a grown woman.. But I will certainly tell her, that her fianc? is longing for her.. Please have her ring me, as soon as she returns... I will tell her.. What can she buy after the shops close? - A bus ticket perhaps.. If you were gallant, you would have met Joan at the bus depot Gallant?... I am gallant, good evening.. He's really worried about her.. If I were Clifford Lynn... you are the one, I would rather pursue And as for Joan, he should indeed worry.. What does that mean? Where's Joan? In the best of hands my dear, believe me.. Who are you? Have I changed? You.. - That's right You are more beautiful than ever.. There are so many seats here.. Why are you standing? Please sit.. - I want to get out of here.. Where can you go? To your uncle, who wants to sell you for money to Clifford Lynn? I fully understand if you love him.. I wish to marry you.. I warn you Miss Bray.. Clifford Lynn wont live long Because of his ideals, he forces me to eliminate him He doesn't like Chinese.. We don't like him.. What do you want from me? Your life isn't worth a penny.. When Clifford Lynn decides to co-operate with me Your life will be spared.. All you have to do, is to write a letter to your fianc? Here, I?ve already prepared it.. You're young beautiful and clever.. I presume.. Now, sign it.. Sign it! It's Clifford Lynn, good evening Miss Mabel.. I was wondering.. - Joan is still not here She's not in her room? - No.. Yes, well if she isn't back by midnight I'm going to call the police.. Yes, goodbye Mabel.. Eddie! What's happened to you? Here I go again.. I was walking down the street, thinking of nothing at all When suddenly, I saw a most wonderful Chinese vase A heavenly vase, red enamel on a light blue background, the pattern of Tu-Fu.. Don't bother me with Tu-Fu.. I'm asking you what has happened to your head! It's broken, and the vase also You shouldn't treat me so harshly, it still hurts me Yes but, has someone knocked you down? Were you run over? I was run over, I mean, knocked out! Who? - From behind.. You idiot! I'm asking you, who? Yes, the inspector.. But you don't know... Please, that Miss... These names.. Your bride.. Joan Bray? You must be out of your mind! Joan Bray, that was it.. At least I can remember her name If you don't tell me immediately, what has being going on.. I'm going to strangle you on the spot! No, don?t strangle me.. She was only with me.. - When? I see I'll have to elucidate.. Point by point.. Well, today I saw her, on Gordon street.. There was a gate, broken vase, broken head And when I recovered.. Go on! - I'm afraid she's vanished.. Who? - Your bride.. Joan? - Right, that?s the name... Message for you.. Forgive me, I afraid these knives are making me nervous What is it, bad news? Joan has been kidnapped.. - No.. That's the reason they knocked me out Adding it all together.. Now I think these little surprises are meant for you.. What?s in the note? - An ultimatum from Fing-Su The yellow snake, for Joan.. This is November 11th, he'll stop at nothing, even murder, to get the yellow snake Then give it to him, so he wont harm the girl.. What's the number of Scotland Yard? Tomorrow at noon, the ship leaves the harbour You will be on that ship, to Hong Kong.. And there will be one other passenger Miss Joan Bray.. You will be responsible for her, and see she doesn't escape The young lady doesn't really want to make the trip.. Ok Mr St. Clay - What's wrong? I'm not an escort, I don't mind running guns for you.. But no kidnapping.. I'm not interested in your sentiments You will continue to do my bidding.. I'm sorry.. - What are you sorry for? The weapons that you smuggle for me? The people that you blackmail.. The treason on your own country? Or the money you accept from me? I'm sorry for it all... Have a pleasant journey... Miss Bray... Don't be scared.. Come with me, I wont hurt you... Yes, but this is not enough evidence for an arrest Mr Lynn.. That letter is a clear cut case of blackmail! It's type written.. We can't prove it came from St. Clay.. And my head? - You didn't see who did it.. Well how could I, from behind... But the fact is that Miss Bray, has not yet returned... That?s right... May I ask, just who it was who told you.. of Mr St.Clays meeting with your niece? A business friend - I need a precise answer... Mr Spedwell,a business partner, And a friend of St.Clay... Inspector, this man is deeply in debt.. And he'll go to any lengths, to get rid of his creditors... I wont stand for this slander... Mr Lynn, I understand the state you're in.. But I must advise you to choose your words more carefully... You sit here, while some half caste organises every piece of riff raff in the underworld of London.. He ships weapons to Hong Kong.. He wants the world in his power.. He thinks nothing of murder and kidnapping.. And you want me to choose words carefully.. I say something has to be done now, inspector.. Neither Scotland Yard or the government of Hong Kong is sleeping We've known about him for sometime already.. At any rate, I thank you for your co-operation... And I promise you, that we at the yard will do our very best.. Ah ha.. thank goodness for that... Mr Lynn, please help Joan.. Ahh, I wasn't aware, that you or your father were the least bit worried about her.. If I can do anything for you.. - No thank you, thank you The police are competant,goodnight. You're not so bad after all.. My brothers, China is far away But she needs our help.. We, the organisation of the Fighting Hands.. Will turn back the wheels of history We will build a new and powerful China.. A china that will rule the world We'll recapture the yellow snake.. And she will lead us to victory.. We will be more successful than our brothers during the Boxer rebellion On the 17th,the day of the dragon, with those from Hong Kong.. We'll fight and win... This was Clifford Lynn.. There can be no mercy.. You! find Joan Bray if you have to turn London upside down.. You! Go to Samuel Carter's I'm going mad with this waiting.. If he has Joan, and harms her.. I swear, I?ll kill him with my bare hands.. Well give him the yellow snake, and your troubles are over.. Nonsense, and plunge the world into war? Oh come now, what can a small band of Chinese do? Besides, as soon as you have Joan, you can call the police anyway.. Call the police? They already know everything.. But by the time they decide to do their job.. It will be the 17th of November, and Fing-Su is in Hong Kong.. And all of this because of a stupid symbol.. By the way, where did you put that stupid reptile? My head.. - Here.. Now I understand why they're being on my head so much I can't carry it with me all the time! It's a funny feeling to know the lives of so many depend upon it, even Joan.. The whole thing isn't worth a 1000 pounds.. The artwork is poor, the stones aren't expensive.. And all together... it's actually worthless.. Some 300 years old.. I wish I'd never even seen the stinking thing! I agree... Why in the world hasn't inspector Frasier called me yet? Scotland Yard can't even put their stupid men in to action in 2 hours! He was supposed to ring me up at once! Eddie.. - Yes Cliff.. There's something wrong here, it?s silent.. I don't understand.. Are you sure? Here, listen.. Stupid... Cliff!.. There! That?s the end.. I'm very sorry Mr Narth, that I had to send for you, in the middle of the night.. But time pressed.. I must speak with you.. Because of you, I?m in an awkward position now Mr St.Clay.. The police have questioned me.. And Clifford Lynn asked about Joan.. You see? I expected that.. As I've already told you Mr Narth.. You needn't worry about your niece, you?ll see her very soon At the moment, it?s something quite different,Mr Narth Please.. - Thank you.. I need, here in London, a new business manager Our friend Spedwell, must undertake a very long journey I myself will be leaving about the 16th of November.. However, I am going to continue business here.. I have confidence in you Mr Narth.. I.. you honour me Mr St.Clay.. Our future relations will grow stronger, not only because of your niece Joan.. But also because of your position with me.. I don't have to tell you what this will mean to you financially.. Of course not.. There is, however a ceremonious act that you must perform It was my idea that we bring you in to the Fighting Hands.. So that you?ll know our aims, and be more closely connected with us. You mentioned a ceremony? Yes.. its a distinction granted to very few Europeans up to now.. It will seem strange to you.. But everything is based on symbols, and rites which are marked with submission All great causes, need more servants.. Mr Narth,are you ready for it? What.. now?... In the middle of the night? Few real believers question the time Come here! Now I call you brother.. The meaning of this great organisation, is infallible brotherhood.. And now you'll take the sacred oath.. You must understand, that once you become one of us.. You will never be allowed to resign, never! Except by death.. Repeat after me.. I will be a servant I.. I will be a servant.. By my honour, and the blood of all traitors By my honour, and the blood of all traitors.. My faith and truth I pledge My faith and truth I pledge.. Strike in the symbolic mark! Strike now! It's only a symbol.. A wax figure.. Strike now! You swine! Murderer! You've made me a murderer! You've made me a murder a man! Wearing the bridal gown before the wedding day brings misfortune But only to the bride.. Mr Lynn, I should have taken you.. Help me! I thank you.. I'll never forget what you've done for me.. That's alright.. But you must promise to stay in the house and lock yourself in.. You know where to find me if anything happens.. - Yes.. And one more thing... No one must know about it - Yes, I understand.. Goodnight - Goodnight.. Cliff! Cliff.. Cliff... Oh,he'll never come round.. I don't know why not, that Buddha wasn't heavy why didn't you give him some help? What?.. I was like a furious lion I fought off 50 or 60 Chinese men here What.. how did you get here? - Please don't ask.. Something terrible has happened Mabel is dead.. Mabel? What.. who? In her own house.. Scotland Yard has been called Here, drink up.. How long have I been lying here? - Oh quite some time.. If I had counted you out, it would be 5000 by now.. Please tell me, where is the.. - That damn snake.. They took it away... Ah,inspector Frasier... I rang him up immediately.. Excuse me.. Joan, what happened to Mabel? I found her, dead.. She was wearing my wedding gown.. It was dreadful.. - You'll be alright.. Good evening.. Good evening inspector.. Yes Mr Lynn, I heard, it was rather tough eh? Yes it was.. You must be the lady who was kidnapped You must tell me about it later.. Inspector, Mabel Narth is... Yes, the homicide squad is on it already The police may seem to work slowly.. But when we have the proof, we work very quickly.. I'm going to arrest St. Clay, He's at his factory, most probably.. Would you like to come? I'm coming.. I'm coming too I'm sorry, but this is no place for a lady.. Oh please.. - Alright,but you must stay outside.. One moment inspector - Yes? You not only arrest St. Clay, but all the other Chinese... Or else they might come back.. No, I?m not going to stay in this house alone.. My friends.. Who told you to kill her? You were to bring her here alive.. Now the police will come.. Get out! My brothers.. This night was stained with blood.. I swear, that you will forever.. Regain the glory of your ancestors Our enemies blood will flow Commencing the day of the dragon We will strike... And we will conquer... In Hong Kong, China, all the world is ours.. The yellow snake is again in our possession And weapons, enough for all to be equipped.. Now fortune, victory, and the gods... are with us.. No! Who dares to speak? Who are you? Don't you recognise me? Father.. You live.. You vile scum, you dare to call me father? A murderer a thief, you my own son! Why you're nothing but a filthy raving lunatic! You're a disgrace to all humanity! Stop, before I forget you are my father.. Out of my way! Hurry, see that you get the guard - Yes Sir.. In here.. - Come on.. Here it is.. Break down the door.. Will you be quiet you numbskull.. If you can't be quiet, then get out! I will be quiet.. In here, are the weapons, inspector They're all gone.. They must have shipped them to Hong Kong already.. Isn't that just beautiful.. Third Per-Jang period.. The imperial manufacturer... Cliff! I like that sound.. Wonderful... Cliff, look here in this ugly cellar, I found a beautiful.. My aching head... Cover the exit! - Yes Sir.. Joe.. - Cliff.. I killed him.. The world must have peace.. It will have it, now.. Thank goodness.. Think of all the bloodshed that's been prevented.. Come, let?s go home Cliff!... Cliff! Cliff, help me... I haven't done anything, and they're going to arrest me.. They should.. Because of your unpardonable impudence This man is innocent.. There.. - This I'm sure of.. The world would be a prison, if impudence were a crime... Subtitles made by McDuck 30th September 2008 From the Bgart 13 English dub DVD rip
