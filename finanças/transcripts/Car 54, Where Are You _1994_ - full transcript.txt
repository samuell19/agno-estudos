IT WAS JUST LIKE A SCENE OUTTA ONE OF THEM COP SHOWS! I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT IN MY LIFE! ALL RIGHT, FELLAS. NOTICE HERE ON THE BOARD-- "MAXIMUM AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT FOR CRIMINAL OPERATIONS AND POLICE PROCEDURES." "MAD COPP." I'M TELLIN' YOU, THIS IS A PROUD DAY FOR THE 53rd. WE'RE FINALLY GETTING ORGANIZED. GONNA BE A LOT OF CHANGES TAKING PLACE AROUND HERE. TO BEGIN WITH, WE HAVE A NEW RECRUIT. THE POLICE ACADEMY IS TURNING OUT A DIFFERENT BREED OF COP NOWADAYS, AND I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE FUTURE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFFICER FRANCIS MULDOON. OFFICER MULDOON IS THE MOST DECORATED GRADUATE OF THE ACADEMY, AND HE IS EXTREMELY WELL-VERSED IN EVERY ASPECT OF THIS NEW SYSTEM. AS OF TOMORROW NIGHT, HE WILL BE OFFICER TOODY'S NEW PARTNER. OFFICER MULDOON, THEY'RE ALL YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SIR. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TODAY IS AN EXCITING DAY... BECAUSE IT'S THE FIRST DAY IN THE REST OF YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT CAREERS. NOT MINE, NOT MINE. COMPUTERS, SATELLITES, PSYCHOLOGICAL HARASSMENT-- YOU'LL BE LEARNING IT ALL. WHY? QUITE FRANKLY, TO KEEP THE GUTTER-LOVING SCUM OF THIS PLANET FROM DESTROYING THE MORAL FABRIC OF OUR GREAT NATION, SO THAT OUR MOTHERS CAN WALK THE STREETS AT NIGHT. WHY, IS YOUR MOTHER A STREET WALKER? HA HA HA! BUT FIRST, WE HAVE TO PREPARE, AS I'M SURE YOU ALL CAN IMAGINE. MENTALLY, PHYSICALLY... SPIRITUALLY. SO STARTING TOMORROW, ALL OFFICERS WILL BE EXPECTED TO REPORT ONE HOUR EARLY BEFORE THEIR SHIFT FOR CLASSES IN MAD COPP, AND THEN ONE HOUR EVERY NIGHT FOR PHYSICAL TRAINING AFTER THEIR DAY SHIFT. THAT'S TWO EXTRA HOURS! YOU'RE RIGHT. AND THAT'S WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION. THANK YOU FOR VOLUNTEERING. SO, FRANCIS, TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER, BECAUSE WE'RE TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER, AND OF COURSE, IT MAKES FOR A BETTER WORKING RELATIONSHIP-- DON'T YOU THINK? OFFICER TOODY, I DON'T BELIEVE IN IDLE CHIT-CHAT DURING PATROLS. IT BREAKS UP CONCENTRATION, AND WE JUST MIGHT MISS A CRIME. Woman: HELP! HELP! RIGHT THERE! ( siren ) HELP! HELP! HE ROBBED ME! I GOT HIM, MA'AM. DON'T SHOOT! WHAT HAPPENED, MRS. PEROGI? HE ORDER A LOX, TOMATO AND ONION SANDWICH AND HE DIDN'T PAY! HOW MUCH DID THE SANDWICH COST, MRS. PEROGI? FOUR DOLLARS AND FIFTY-FIVE CENTS. HERE. KEEP THE CHANGE. WE'LL FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE THING. OFFICER TOODY, WE SHOULD BE TAKING THAT WOMAN DOWN TO THE PRECINCT IMMEDIATELY FOR A POSITIVE I.D. ON THE CULPRIT. SIDEBURNS, CAP-- IT'S GANG-RELATED. OH, YEAH. THE ONES WITH THE BEANIES, THEY'RE THE WORST! SHOULDA HAD HIM. Anderson: COME IN, GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE 53rd. CAPTAIN, BEFORE WE BEGIN, IS THIS OFFICE SECURE? SECURE? WELL, I GET A NICE FEELING WHEN I COME IN HERE. NO. NO, SIR, WE'RE TALKING BUG-WISE. OH, BUG-WISE. WELL, THERE, YOU GOT ME. THEY FUMIGATE REGULARLY HERE, BUT THIS BUILDING IS SO OLD. LISTENING DEVICES, CAPTAIN. OH, THAT KIND OF BUG. CAPTAIN, WE HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT WITNESS WE'D LIKE YOU TO PUT ON ICE. NO PROBLEM. WE HAVE ICED MANY A WITNESS. WHO IS HE? HERBERT HORTZ. HERBERT HORTZ. AND AGAINST WHOM IS HE TESTIFYING? DON MOTTI. GENTLEMEN, MAYBE YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER! DON "PRETTY BOY" MOTTI IS THE MOST RUTHLESS THUG IN THE CITY! Man: AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T STEP INSIDE THE CIRCLE. HE DON'T LIKE TO BE CRAMPED. HE HATES SMALL PLACES. MR. MOTTI, THIS IS NICO. THE GUY I WAS TELLIN' YOU ABOUT. YES, NICO. SIT DOWN. CARLO, WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS? GET NICO A DRINK. GOT IT. MR. MOTTI. FOR ME, I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT A PLEASURE IT IS TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCES WITH YOURSELF. WHY IS IT ALL YOU THUGS TALK LIKE YOU WENT TO FINISHING SCHOOL WITH ROBERT De NIRO? DID CARLO FILL YOU IN? CARLO HAS INFORMED ME ABOUT THE UNFORTUNATE ABDUCTION OF YOUR CLOSEST FINANCIAL ADVISOR, MR. HORTZ, BY THE AUTHORITIES. HE'S NOT MY CLOSEST FINANCIAL ADVISOR. HE'S A GOD DAMN BOOKKEEPER AND I WANT YOU TO BLOW THE SON-OF-A-BITCH AWAY BEFORE HE TESTIFIES TO THE GRAND JURY ON FRIDAY. SORRY, BOSS. I'M A RESPECTED MAN. I CARE ABOUT SOCIAL ISSUES. SUCH AS? RECYCLING, BOSS? RECYCLING. MY GARBAGE COMPANY WAS THE FIRST IN THE CITY TO START SEPARATING ITS TRASH. MEDICAL TO LONG ISLAND, TOXICS TO JERSEY. I GOT MY IMAGE TO THINK ABOUT. SO YOU BLOW THE SQUEALER AWAY, AND MAKE ME A HAPPY MAN. MR. MOTTI, I ASSURE YOU THAT MR. HORTZ WILL SLEEP WITH THE FISHES BEFORE THE SUN SETS. SALUD. SALUD. AWRIGHT, GET OUTTA HERE. THANK YOU. ( whispers ) He's claustrophobic. He don't like dark little places. Know what I mean? LUCILLE, I'M HOME! GRRR... RUFF! HEY, I'M STARVED. WHAT'S FOR DINNER? TOSSED SALAD? YOU COME HOME AT 11:00 AT NIGHT, GUNTHER, YOU EXPECT ME TO JUMP AND WHIP YOU UP SOMETHIN' TO EAT? YOU GOT NERVE, GUNTHER TOODY, YOU REALLY GOT NERVE! NOT NERVE, LUCILLE-- HUNGER! NOT IN THIS LIFETIME, BUSTER! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?! I HAD TO DECORATE THE REC ROOM FOR SCHNAUZER'S PARTY. WHAT, A STAG FUNCTION, IS THAT IT, GUNTHER? WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA HAVE A BIG CAKE, YOU GONNA HAVE GIRLS IN LITTLE DENTAL FLOSS BIKINIS JUMPIN' OUTTA THERE, GETTIN' DOWN ON THEIR KNEES, DOIN' WRETCHED THINGS TO YOU SO-CALLED OFFICERS OF THE LAW? I PICTURE THE WHOLE THING, GUNTHER TOODY. NOT EVEN CLOSE, LUCILLE. IT'S A SURPRISE PARTY. OH, YEAH? WELL, TOO BAD LEO'S NOT YOUR WIFE. THEN HE'D BE SURPRISED EVERY DAY JUST HOW MISERABLE HIS LIFE IS. COME ON, LUCILLE, I JUST GOT HOME! ARE YOU CHEATIN' ON ME, GUNTHER TOODY? CHEATING? ARE YOU CRAZY? YOU'D KILL ME! WORSE. I WOULD TAKE YOUR SCROTUM, STRETCH IT UP OVER YOUR HEAD, AND I WOULD USE YOU AS A PUNCHING BAG! LUCILLE, I'M SENSING SOME HOSTILITY HERE. WHAT'S WRONG? COP GROUPIES. COP GROUPIES? YES, COP GROUPIES. TODAY ON GERALDO. I SAW THE WHOLE THING. THESE BEAUTIFUL, GORGEOUS, THIN WOMEN WHO HAVE RAVENOUS SEXUAL APPETITES FOR ANY GUY WITH A BADGE AND A UNIFORM, NO MATTER HOW PATHETIC, LAME OR GROSS HE MIGHT BE. IT MADE ME THINK OF YOU, GUNTHER. THAT'S ONLY IN CALIFORNIA. IN BROOKLYN, YOU GOTTA PAY. OH, GUNTHER! LUCILLE. WHAT? WHY WOULD I GO OUT FOR HAMBURGER WHEN I GOT STEAK AT HOME? DO YOU MEAN IT, GUNTHER? YEAH, I MEAN IT.

I WAS WATCHIN' SALLY JESSE RAPHAEL TODAY, AND IT WAS A SHOW ABOUT SPOUSES AND COMMUNICATION AND EVERYTHING, IT WAS ABOUT TALKING AND INTIMACY, AND I WAS THINKING MAYBE TONIGHT YOU AND ME COULD NOT WATCH TV, INSTEAD WE COULD JUST TALK. LUCILLE, THIS IS POLICE BUSINESS. I'LL GIVE YOU POLICE BUSINESS, GUNTHER, I'LL GIVE YOU A HOMICIDE, IS WHAT I'LL GIVE YOU! I WANNA TALK, GUNTHER. LUCILLE, I BEG YOU. JUST GIVE ME 30 MINUTES TO WATCH MY FAVORITE PROGRAM. OKAY? JUST 30 MINUTES. AND THEN, I PROMISE YOU, YOU CAN TORTURE ME-- I MEAN, WE CAN TALK ALL YOU WANT, ALL NIGHT LONG.

HE IS BEING MOVED TO AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION AFTER NARROWLY ESCAPING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A CRUDE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT. Anderson: YEAH, FELLAS, FOLLOW ME RIGHT THIS WAY. NATHAN'S HERE.

WE'RE IN A LITTLE RENOVATION PROCESS NOW, BUT THIS IS OUR NICEST CELL, AND HERE'S A LITTLE FLOWERY WELCOME FOR YOU. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU GOT A LITTLE RODENT PROBLEM. NO, THE RODENTS DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. WELL, IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE RATS, IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME! OKAY! WELL, THEN, I'M GOING TO JAIL! I'LL BE SLEEPING IN HERE, THEN, RIGHT, CAPTAIN? YES.

SHE COMES BACK, AND THERE IS HER HUSBAND, LAID OUT IN A BEAUTIFUL BLUE SUIT. SO SHE SAYS, "HOW DID YOU GET THAT SUIT ON MY HUSBAND? DID YOU SWITCH SUITS WITH ONE OF THESE OTHER STIFFS?"

I DON'T THINK IT'S WISE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT THE SEMINARY! HE NEEDS A BROAD, THAT'S ALL. OH, GET YOUR MIND OUT OF THE GUTTER. THIS IS NOT THE GUTTER, LUCILLE. THIS IS SCIENCE. MEN HAVE THIS VERY SPECIAL KIND OF A MALE GLAND CALLED THE... THE PROSTICLES. WHEN THESE TESTICLES GET FILLED UP WITH FLUID AND STUFF, THEY GET VERY, VERY TENSE. YEAH? TAKE IT FROM A COP ON THIS ONE, LUCILLE. THESE TESTOSTICLES ARE THE CAUSE OF 85% OF THE VIOLENT CRIME IN THIS CITY. I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT, GUNTHER. THAT'S BETWEEN HIM AND HIS DOCTOR. I GOT JUST THE GIRL FOR HIM. WHO? VELMA VELOUR. VELMA! SHE HAS VERY TANGIBLE ACCOUTREMENT THAT MEN FIND IRRESISTIBLE. REALLY? YOU BE CAREFUL. YOU'RE GONNA CORRUPT THAT BOY. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. LET'S DO THE WILD THING, LUCILLE. GUNTHER! COME OVER HERE, YOU LITTLE SEX POT. ( all talking ) PIPE DOWN, THE CAPTAIN'S COMIN'.
