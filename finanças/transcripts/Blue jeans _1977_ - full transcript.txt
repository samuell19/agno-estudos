Leave him alone, Germiaud...all right? Hey, let's bug Lawn with the song! Kervelot copied down the words... The curé of Camaret...His balls hang down... Here they go again! They're incorrigible! And he gets a hard-on...! This is really too much! Don't you know any intelligent songs? Do you know what you're singing? I can explain sir! It's a song about... Germiaud, that's enough! Keep it up and you'll be on the next boat home... ...with a letter that won't make your mother proud! Surely you could sing something else! For example...A la Bastille It's not for choir-boys either Come on, sing along with me... Right, thanks a lot! I've never had a group like this! Where are we actually going? To Margate With the biggest jelly-fish in England... ...and giant soft-ices! Hey! Morin tricked his English "mother"... He told her the French eat jellyfish! So she tried to cook one... It came out pasty white and stinking! Didn't she say it looked like sperm? He doesn't know what that is! Morin's pure... Pure? You'd have to ask Jean-Pierre about that! He found you pure, didn't he, Morin? But did he leave you as pure? Look...he's got a spot on his fly! Dirty bastards! What did I ever do to you? Now what? What did you do to make Julien cry? You're all very funny! And there go the others again... You little morons! Will you shut up? The curé of Cameret...His balls hang down... He sits on them. And says "Beg pardon" They ram him right up the arse And he gets a hard-on...! Come in! What do you want? You should be on the beach You don't look good... Come over here It can't be that bad...take a seat Tell me what's wrong I'm sure it's not that bad... Would you like a sandwich? They're good...some kind of salad Is it about the pal you were with the other day on the beach? How did you know? You know when you kids talk, I hear it too Don't pay any attention! But it's a dirty lie! Jean-Pierre's my best pal... That's all! That's all? It's terrific! It's marvellous to have a real pal... ...not to be alone It's nothing to cry about But I don't know where he is! Don't worry, you'll find him Go down to the beach and have a swim You'll feel better afterwards...all right? Thank you - but I don't feel like it Stop shaking it like that... ...or you'll never win I've lost my last penny What's the time...? Here's a penny... No! What time is it? We don't punch a clock What time is it? 12:30 Shit, I'm late for lunch... Hey, you don't look too good... Have you seen Jean-Pierre? Yes, he's behind the dunes with Janet, but... Hey, Julian! Here we are! You look awful! What's up? Why didn't you come? I was with Janet...Haven't you ever been in love? Can the other fellows be right? Are you just a nice little fairy? Want to kiss me? You've flipped! Dirty little queer! You see Janet the jealousy stunt he pulled on me? You queer! Dear Jean-Pierre... It has turned cold in Herne Bay I've seen Janet since you left She gave me your address I was angry with myself for fighting with you I hope you're not angry any more Anyway, I'm sorry it happened Are you working the harvest in Brittany? I'd like to try it too... ...if I'm still invited But why don't you come and visit me in Auvergne? You'll see, trout and crayfish aren't bad either I know my parents will say yes If you can't come, I'll see you when school starts Le Vesinet is quite close to Paris Sir! Why are you out here? You're frozen... Come on home with me, we'll have some tea I understand very well what you've just told me... It'll all work out, you'll see Feel better? Yes...a little Still frozen, aren't you? Look, we'll put some whisky in your tea... Oh, it's strong! Hey, Morin...want some? Come on Morin...have a drink! Are you down, man? A drink'll pick you up...

Make him say what his mother sold Tell us what your mother sold This is ridiculous! Say it... What did your mother sell? Bastards! She sold...! My mother sold butter to the Krauts...! My little Julien... I couldn't come to meet you in Paris I had to go to your poor Aunt Sybil's funeral Look at your school report... It's not exactly brilliant I've left you twenty francs to have dinner out Be sure not to miss the train tomorrow morning You're so absent-minded... Love and kisses...your Papa Would you like the paper, Madame? Strong coffee...gave me indigestion They made me pay half-fare for my little dog... He's not six months old yet Children under six years travel free Young dogs are as delicate as young children Isn't that so, Madame? He doesn't even have the right to a seat! The young man has your place Ask him nicely, I'm sure he'll take you on his lap during the trip Won't you, young man? Young man! Do you want him on your lap? There...He'll be fine when he gets used to you Don't be afraid He's a very nice boy... Young people now aren't as bad as the papers say I'm not saying that they're all nice... Some of them aren't nice at all! But he's a very nice boy... Very nice Young man, you are an honour to your sex! Is this a smoking compartment? Yes! Did you have fun, dear? Did any letters come for me? Just your school report, your father was furious about your Maths That teacher's a rat, isn't he? Gerald brought a friend from the institute... A certain lack of class, but charming Lionel has great fun with them Florence keeps quiet so your father thinks she's fine for Gerald Poor Gerald...And your sister's son is giving her trouble... My little Julien...you've grown! An English accent! Papa, you always exaggerate! You've grown He knows...Papa already told him Come and meet Gerard's pal...he's funny He's my pal too An aperitive? Do I offer one to Julien? Of course! He's now a man of the world, who has travelled and speaks good English... Julien, just to please me, speak English for us Edmond, leave the child alone Julien, to please your mother, go and rest That's really nice of you, I'm really touched Did Cedric have a good trip? Yes, and it's restful at my in-laws' place The air on the Atlantic is so good Auvergne has the purest air A bit cold and damp, but pure And their water can't compare, We're at the source our water is even bottled But the cure just tired Cedric And Lionel teases him too much I work better than Cedric Lionel, that's nonsense Cedric is only four Anyway children don't speak at table At four, I worked better than Cedric My little rowdy... Well, Mama, shall I be frank? Lionel is a brat! You're spoiling him completely... Gerald and I weren't spoiled I had no bike, I didn't eat with you... We two ate first, with Miss Marcepoil We ate what was set before us! Miss Marcepoil was nice So nice that I never got dessert At lessons, she'd rap my knuckles! I've never told you about that! We weren't so unhappy! Not you...her favourite! But she detested me! An unhappy childhood? Poor Sylvie... Were we that mean to you? Yes! You were very mean to me! You know I'm tired... It's too unfair! "An angel passes..." It's true, Sylvie does seem tired... So Jean, were you... ...unhappy as a child? Have you any brothers or sisters? Yes, a brother who's a painter, and a sister still at school. Your brother paints? Yes, he paints houses... it's better than spraying cars He earns good money Sorry, I was just trying to relieve the tension My brother's a student as well Good, the table can be cleared...we've finished I haven't finished! Next time you won't be so slow Julien, would you like to see the paper? Here, a letter for you... "Why don't you come and visit me in the Auvergne?" "You'll see, trout and crayfish aren't bad either" Lionel, go and play somewhere else! "I know my parents will say yes" Hello! I really enjoyed your letter...
