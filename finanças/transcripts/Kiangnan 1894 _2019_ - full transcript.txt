Chief of Town God's Temple is here. Greetings from Fujia Village. Gang of Lady Killers comes to pay respects. Your Prestigious Majesty! King Lang! Rise to your feet. You've come all the way here. I'm glad. You are really a universally renowned, earthshaking hero. Wow, it's blinding! Wow, that's the... Celestial aircraft! The heavy armored reptile has nothing on my airship! They don't call me King Lang for nothing. I can go in and out of the Bureau as I please. More traps? Bring them on! Huh? You want to beat me with a swatter? Awesome! Hail to King Lang! Hail to King Lang! I will kill you! Those are really huge waves. What a massive steel vessel! I almost forget the important thing. Hurry, don't let the guards see us. I was the first to find this place, and I want to show you around to open your eyes today. There's a damp smell of the rainy season. Why is it so dark here? My mom said this place is haunted. Who are you talking about? A ghost! Stop screaming. Ah, you frightened me. You can go back if you are afraid of ghosts. Get off, chicken. Follow Lang and see the place. This is the most important place of the Bureau. The treasure is covered with cloth. But I can't see anything. Lang, it doesn't look like a treasure. You know nothing. If it looks like a treasure at a glance, it must be a fake from Mr. Wang. My dad? I don't fool you guys. Come here. Just shut your mouth and watch. I've visited so many places in the Bureau. I'm sure you've never seen such a modern steel ship before. It's dusty. It's so dusty. That's disappointing. So? Isn't it something rare? Strange-looking iron racks. It's ominous. What? This is obviously a steam steel vessel. It's badly rusted, so it's nothing but some scrap metal. I'll sail it for you right now. There must be some mechanism with every movable part. Well, Lang is just a big bluffer. His father makes wooden boats. How could he sail a steel ship? I broke it. What's that noise? Look, look! Look! Wow! It's moving! Lang really can sail a steel ship! You are impressed, aren't you? Finally got by. It's you again! I won't let you off this time! Someone is after us. Run! This way! Hey, you guys come back. It's just a little girl. What's a little girl doing here? She is climbing up to get Lang. Whatever. I'm not afraid of you. Get your dirty hands off Flying Fish Boat. Get down! Flying Fish Boat? I'm touching it. What are you gonna do? Well, so you want to learn it the hard way. Let go! I told you not to touch my brother's Flying Fish Boat. You've made trouble here again and again. Stop right there! Take my Thunder Kick! I didn't know Lang does Kungfu! What a kick! You stinky monkey, Get out of the way! Steamed Bun, run! So many things are falling down. They are getting hit! Get out of here! Good thing I'm fast. This is a disaster. Oh, no, the girl can't get out. Lower your head and climb out from the right exit. I'll hold the ship. There's sand in the corner. Put out the fire on the tarpaulin with it. There'll be trouble if it burns up. Just run, Lang! Or they'll get you! Don't run if you count yourself as a hero! Put Steamed Bun down! Sister, this is it. Lang really lives on the boat. It was him who took us to the Bureau last night. I didn't do anything. You're an accomplice. Get out of my way. You can run, but you can't hide. I can find you wherever you are. Lang, don't be afraid. She doesn't bring a wrench today. Fatty is still waiting in line at Town God's Temple. Join us soon. Bye, sister. What... what do you want? We have bills to fix. You thought you'd get away with it? Last night, you sneaked into the Manufacturing Bureau with them. You caused machinery damage and set the warehouse on fire. We worked on it all night. The damage list is here. Every bill is charged to you. It's 317 taels of silver in total. Take a closer look. Where's your arrogance now? Pay! How could all those rusty metals cost so much? I've never met someone so ignorant like you before. We at the Manufacturing Bureau put everything down in black and white. Don't waste time. You are Lang, right? It seems that you've turned 13. Go to the Bureau tomorrow and work as a three-year trainee to pay your debts by labor. The Manufacturing Bureau is foggy during the day? There're even railways here. Hey, buddy, watch out for the dumper. Come on, let's go. You'll see those every day. I'll take you to meet our master. This is it? What's that noise? Morning, Uncle Zhang, Ma. Morning, Yulan. You've got us another newbie? Don't touch the masters' stuff. Why? They are all metal. Petty. This is not your little wooden boat. Don't cry when they break your fingers. Tianfu, Gui Liu, good morning. Is my dad here? Morning, Yulan. This metal thing is like a hammer. Hey, you still don't know the rules, do you? You have to be observant, alert and loyal. The dwarf newbie comes to work in over-sized clothes and wants to learn to operate lathes. They cut clean through iron with sparks flying. Study and train hard and don't waste time. Don't waste time. Don't run in the workshop! Stop! You can't come in here! Don't cross the line for safety production. Ouch, it hurts! What's so great about being a blacksmith? You are too thin to be a blacksmith. Who wants to be a blacksmith anyway? It's hard labor with low wage, and the noise is unbearable, too. What else can you do other than getting yourself in trouble? The drawing, it must be drawn by foreigners. I'll show you what I've got. Well, you really talk big. Flying Fish Boat. Twin propeller drive. Bilge keels not that long. Driven by steam engine. Plus iron clad. Yeah, that's about it. Small steam ironclad. That's my brother's boat. Come and check what the boy is drawing on the blackboard. It looks like Jiashu's boat. Is he Master Chen's new apprentice? Master Chen's got a new apprentice? That's rare. No, no, he is a novice, not qualified enough to be our master's apprentice. The boat he drew is really something. Why are you guys all standing around? Good morning, Master. Dad, I've brought that stinky troublemaker here. You must be Master Chen. How do you think about my boat? Yulan, how can you let this kid scrabble on the workshop blackboard? Don't go! Master is a nice guy, as long as you will never touch Jiashu's stuff again. You are assured of food, -clothing and wage here. -This is not for me. If you'll excuse me. You scared me. What a bad morning! Time to work! Power outputting. Be careful! Valves open and shafts running. Production safety first! There you are. Give me the kit. You see how he treated me? A master threatening a trainee! A public threat! I want mental damage compensation, 30 taels of silver per month! Don't call names or play tricks! You ruined our Flying Fish Boat, don't play the victim here. You can leave, but your parents have to pay off your debts! I'm a responsible guy, not a deadbeat. I won't leave lest you should ruin my reputation. Is he leaving or not? Wake up and go to work! Wake up and go to work! The woods we walked through together -The years eroded by the waves -Ouch, it hurts! Through the seasons Effeminate. Are no longer seen Concentrate! The innocence of those days Still rings in my ears Trainee, you are slacking off? Go back to work! A trainee also need to take a break. You are striking back? Let me hit you back! Let me check your work. They fit together perfectly. You are making progress. Become stronger every time Where the stars shine, you are always there Opposing torque is needed for this structure. I look up when I am lost in the darkness The great river washes away all the vicissitudes of life The light of sun, moon and stars No matter how far away, I will come to you Share the joys of childhood Lang, it's time for dinner! Let's call it a day! Did you hear that? The navy ship is going to dock, and the magistrate will be there. I bet there will be an awful lot of people. Stop! Why are you running? Stop! How dare you steal from the Manufacturing Bureau? I'll shoot if you don't stop! I won't let you deliver your drawing into the Manufacturing Bureau. Humph, another fake one. Who is that, setting off firecrackers at midnight? Someone gets killed! That's the last steel plate. I've finally done taking down the attack angles. Lang, I'm doing you a favor at my own peril. Flying Fish Boat is in bad repair, so it's a big project. Can we really do this? Yes, I'm convinced that we can do this. I have so many materials saved up just to show Chen what we've got. Don't tell him yet. You are a trainee, and still wet behind the ears. You ungrateful boy, I shouldn't have being nice to you. How dare you take down my brother's boat? That's called renovation. Don't be so impulsive. Get your dirty hands off it. Many of the bolts are rusted. You have to take the old ones down if you want to replace them. See? I told you. Don't be mad. Calm down. Not before I punch you out! Be reasonable! No violence! You are calling me violent? I have a detailed plan for the renovation. You are doing it under the table and calling that a plan? Yulan? Shut up and get lost. You are with him in this? That's worth a good punching, too! It's Lang who puts me up to it. Lang said we could build this boat ourselves. Take that! Please don't! Yulan, don't! How could you be smiling? After two years of hard work as a trainee, I haven't made enough money to pay off my debts. So you want to destroy the evidence? As long as I can build a Flying Fish Boat. Build a Flying Fish Boat? An apprentice who does not want to surpass his master is not a good one. I want to be a better mechanic than your father. You? Plus me and Tianfu. -Bad news! -He is coming. Bad news! Master said that the trainees are not allowed to visit the ironclad ship. Then I have to do something. It's coming, the ironclad ship is coming. Look! That's the ironclad ship. Furl! Slow down! Attention! Pull in to shore! Attention, all crew members. Ready to pull in to shore. It's in the No. 2 Dock. Let's go take a look. Don't push! Lower the mooring rope! Fall into rank and solute! Don't push. Everybody back off. Don't push. Admission by token only. Excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me. Please show me your pass tokens. We are relatives of the magistrate of Sungkiang. Relatives need tokens, too. Sir, this way please. After you. This is a viewing stand specially for Your Excellencies. The token you want, catch it! You brat! The navy has just returned from a long voyage to Europe. It's the latest model. That's a good move. I'll reward you when we are back. Clothes make the man. Your Excellencies, this way, please. We are boarding! Direct contact with the ironclad. Your Excellencies, the ironclad Hongyuan was imported from Great Britain, with maximum draft of 2300 tons, speed of 18 kn, and a 8. 3 caliber main gun. -Spectacular! -This is the main gun perspective. It's so majestic. Sir, what is 18 kn? Well, it means it can cover the length of 18 horses per second. Foreigners measure the length by horses. You are really learned. Not exactly, What a smatter. Your Excellencies, this way, please. This way. This watchtower is really high. This is a twin-barreled 8. 3 cal naval gun. I'm not wasting any more time. Let me feel the thick metal. It feels really smooth. What a cool gun, and what a cool ironclad! Young gentleman, please come down at once. You can't sit on the gun barrel. The armor is really thick. Yulan, the mast is very high. Why would a girl climb that high? Be careful! Kid, you stay down there. I'm going up there to see the view. I'm the best at climbing masts. I'm the first mechanic who gets on the watchtower! I see the Town God's Temple. So beautiful! Look, Lang climbs up to the watchtower. -Everybody back off! -Lang! -Don't push. Back off! -We are here. I see you guys! You can't go in without a token. -But he got in anyway. -Yeah. You brat, I'll cut you some slack for the sake of Chen. The guard was deceived! The General is here! I ambushed the target at the east gate of the Bureau, But no drawing was found. The information is accurate. The navy comes to the Manufacturing Bureau to repair the ironclad, and the messenger must be around waiting for an opportunity. The drawing must not be sent into the Manufacturing Bureau. Yes, sir. I'll keep watching the meeting place. Stop! The pressure in the steam pipes is too high. Cool it down first. Turn off the heat. Yes, turn off the heat! There are a lot of leakage points. Find them all. You are a senior specialist. So please give us directions for the maintenance. That's a mechanic's job. But... But what? Guan Dai arrives at the engine room. Thanks for your hardworking. Tiehan, just tell me your concerns. Look, Guan Dai, the coal produces too much smoke and soot, and gravels pop in it. This ironclad's boilers can't take coarse coal. And... Stains run rampant in the crankshaft. There is not enough lubricating oil. Brothers, although we are preparing for war in haste, I hope that all of you can be united and ready to go to the front. And Tiehan, please lend us navy a helping hand. Master Chen, I'm at your service! I promise you to keep an eye on this big guy. Tiehan, did you hear about the shooting... outside the east gate the other day? It's said that someone was robbing in the alley. Someone wanted to deliver a drawing into the Manufacturing Bureau, very likely killed. Is it an important ordnance drawing? Probably, there's a rapid-firing gun with multiple barrels, very formidable. Looks like the killer's got his eye on the drawing. What are you doing? I... Give them to me. These are our local food, steamed buns. The guns on the ironclad are really cool. -Eat while they are still hot. -We'll leave you alone. In fact, the heavy guns of the navy are outdated. What do you get us this time? Lang is serving you vinegar. You have to eat steamed buns with Zhenjiang mature vinegar. Yeah, I'm serving you vinegar. Go to the engine room with Tiehan tomorrow. The machines there are more complicated than the guns. Mr. Guan Dai gives me the permission to go inside the ironclad! What's going on in the engine room. A trainee of your level can barely figure out Not to mention girls. Security came to tell me about you today. I'm going to Town God's Temple tonight. Someone will meet me there. It seems to be something about the drawing. Hope everything goes well. Town God's Temple is really boisterous! Look, there are riddles on the lanterns. It's so close to the Bureau, but I seldom come to this lively place. -Let's take a look over there. -Let's go. Let's go check the lanterns. I'm going over there. There's so many people. Be careful. Don't break the sprigs. The Zigzag Bridge looks more beautiful after the snow. Excuse me. There's blood, left by the guy before. Hey, stop! Steamed buns really deserve their reputation. Yeah, the ones from Town God's Temple are the best. Where is he? Get out of the way! Where is he? Sorry, it was my bad. You bad? I can't get the job done because of you, you know? So what do you want? Mind your manners, girl. We can get her to pay in labor. Good idea. What do you want? Try it if you dare. You've got some nerves, standing up for the little girl. They're gangsters. Shame on you for bullying a young girl. You little jerk's full of big talk. What are you standing about? Get him! Go! We'll show you what we Gang of Town God's Temple can do! Well done! Rascals! I'll kill you! That's outrageous! How dare you affray in public? Mr. Guan Dai, they bullied me. Well, it's not my lucky day. Let's go. Let's go. Get out of the way. Oh, no. Help! Shooting is not your strong suit. Don't be absurd. You did the best you could. Just hand over the drawing and you can go. Ha, you can't even load a gun, and you want to fight against me? Come back! Freeze! Who just fired? Sir, I'm just a waiter here. A hand knife? You just wait out here. I'm going in with you. Here I am! Take that! Think I'm afraid of you with your sleeve removed? I'll kill you! Leave it to me. Fairy sending flowers! I did it! Take that kick! Mr. Guan Dai, are you okay? Marines are on the perimeter now. I'm fine. You are a good fighter as a trainee at the Manufacturing Bureau. Thanks. My flour, my meat stuffing, and my steamed buns! All ruined! Keep going backwards to the Flying Fish Boat. Lang, are you ready? You work hard for over two years. Hope you can be taken as an apprentice today. The genius' traineeship is long overdue. I told you he's not ready yet. Just take a look. The trainees are giving you a gift. Look, Lang has fixed my brother's boat. This... From keels to decks, I've renewed and polished them one by one. Latest attack angles for easily cutting through the water... and shallow draft. The apprentice of the Bureau's top mechanic is pretty skillful, huh? Don't you think he's qualified as your apprentice? You wasted all those materials. How dare you touch Jiashu's boat? Listen. Your lathing, clamping, milling, and planing skills are nothing compared to Jiashu. Listen to me, be a good trainee for now, and I'll be supporting you. Lay low and behave yourself. It takes so many materials and great effort, but I've got no appreciation at all. It's an amazing thing that our master even compared you with Jiashu. Yeah, we are so jealous of you. If we had the ironclad back then, my brother probably wouldn't have... If Jiashu is here, He would have approved of my changing of the attack angles. In my father's heart, my brother is always the best. But I'm sure you'll be a responsible first-rate mechanic one day. Really? You really have faith in me? European ironclad ships also evolved from wooden ships. Who would think that iron could float on water? How dare you? You bumped into me the other day, and now you trespass on the Manufacturing Bureau. My surname is Xu and I was a member of Nanyang Navy. So you are also from the navy? You think we were born yesterday? Why should we trust you? Young lady, silence, please. Be careful! This is the gun left by my good friend Jiashu Chen. He died bravely in the Southern Patriotic War. His father, Tiehan Chen, is a top mechanic in the Manufacturing Bureau. Could you please introduce me to him? I have an important machine drawing for Master Chen. An important drawing? Can you show it to me? Xu, it's the guard from the plant. Take the drawing and go! You want to leave with the drawing? No way! It's dangerous here. Let's go! Wait, give me some more time. It's a 12mm 6-barrel rapid-firing gun, whose reciprocator is much more complex than a rifle. It's triggered by a hand crankshaft. What a clever spring design! Go and make sure you deliver the drawing. Go to hell! Please deliver the drawing for me. Another death for this drawing. Learn to behave yourself in my territory! Steamed Bun! Hand over the drawing and I'll spare your life. Lang, go, just go! One step further and I'll burn the drawing. I don't really need it, so we might as well burn it. Bastard, you killed a man for a drawing you don't need! Our guards are here. There's nowhere to run. I'm also a guard now. The shots came from the warehouse. The door is open and there's fire burning. Hurry! Guys, be alert. Xu... I'm so sorry. The key to a six-barrel rapid-firing gun... is the steering gears and the unloading mechanism. The drawing which Xu gave up his life to is kept in my memory. I can draw it. Drawing a machine drawing from memory... There are hundreds of parts and no room for error. Tiehan, look. There's possibility for reverse deduction... if you understand the mechanisms. Lang will draw the drawing from memory, and I'll review it. Yes, sir! Each of these complex mechanical structures... has to be carefully broken down. The firing pin and the spring complete the continuous cycle. The rate of fire is controlled by the handle. The longitudinal gear structure fits the horizontal lever. Yeah, I think this is it. The gun bolt is completed. Yulan, a new piece of paper for me. Here you are. You've been up all night again? The reciprocator of the rapid-firing gun. Lang, well done! So that's how it works, so clever. Done! Brothers of the Manufacturing Bureau, the drawing of the rapid-firing gun delivered by Xu... has been recovered by Lang. So now it's time for you guys to build the gun. Please rest assured. We are at your service, master. Ordnance is indispensable for the greatness of our nation. Faced with a great war, we should do our best in duty bound. Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Gui Liu, Tianfu, you build more steam pipelines to increase the power of the workshop and ensure stable operation of tools, and then forge the rifle barrels, without fail. Yes, sir! Zhang, Ma, reinforce the turning and milling metalworking of gears... to ensure a perfect fit, without fail. Yes, sir! Yulan, carefully select materials that are precisely matched. Yes, sir! Steamed Bun, you're in charge of perimeter security against enemy attacks. It's your job to guard the mechanics. Master, what about me? I've got an important job for you. Go shovel coal for Gui Liu and Tianfu to keep the fire burning. Okay! Are you kidding me? I'm a great mechanic. Why not assigning me to build the gun? All right, stop yelling. We all know you are a great mechanic. I don't want to shovel coal. Dad really has his way. You wouldn't have slept so soundly without all the hard labor. There's more for you to do. Come on, it's Lang's wedding day! What a perfect match! You two are made for each other. Best Couple of the year！ Congratulations! May you have a baby soon. Congratulations, King Lang! Congratulations, Genius Lang! Look, the stone lions turn into flexible mechanisms. There are so many streamed bun stores now. Our wedding banquet is held in Zigzag Bridge flagship store. Lady, Lang, upstairs, please! Mr. Guan Dai, the installation of the gun is completed. We need your permission for test-firing. Buddy, I'll do it myself this time. I'll do it! I drew the drawing of it after all. Lang, it may result in a burst barrel. That's no joke. The gun's drawing is recovered from memory, and the parts were polished and assembled by the trainees. It's a big risk, and I'll take it. Master, let me do it! Stop arguing! My dad's work won't go wrong. Tiehan really has confidence in your drawing. Too much redundancy of the reciprocator... easily leads to jamming of cartridge and a burst barrel. Maybe my drawing is wrong. No. A new rapid-firing gun is built from the drawing. Despite of a burst barrel, we have accumulated experience. This is the first rapid-firing gun of the Bureau, which I believe will soon be finalized after debugging. Really? Great! I told you I'm a genius! Don't be too proud. Your drawing has been corrected by my dad. A first-class mechanic doesn't do anything rash. Lang, you did a great job. You are like a mechanic now. You bet! Enough! You were taken in by a trainee! The Manufacturing Bureau got the drawing and successfully developed the weapon. The navy has been equipped with Gatling Gun now. Qian Tian, you are utterly defeated by the underage trainee. Now do you know what to do? Yeah, destroy the Manufacturing Bureau! Tiehan, we are equipped with the fast-firing gun thanks to Lang. What a rare talent. That's just some petty trick, and he needs more training. So, what do you think about taking him as your apprentice? The youngest mechanic, better than his master. You used to say that about yourself. And suddenly we are old. No, we are in our prime. Mr. Guan Dai, an urgent message from the Military Department! Now, if you'll excuse me. Look, the ironclad is weighing anchor. The navy is about to set out. They are coming! What a high wave! Our navy is the most powerful in Asia! Dad, you're only a mechanic. Why are you going to war with the navy? They need a practiced hand for the boilers and machine maintenance. It has always been my wish to go to war like your brother did. Brat, don't always think about being a genius. You've got a lot of work to do at the Bureau. Take care of Yulan. It's finally done. You've got... Lang, we have made many spare parts recently. What's your plan? Sending them to the north, of course. That's my boy. We've got the same thought. I'm going, too. To meet my dad. That's a long trip for a girl. You are disobedient to your senior sister apprentice? I'm not taken as an apprentice by your dad, so you are not my senior sister. Oh, no! Come on! Help! Enemy attack! Sir, sir, are you all right? Where is Uncle Zhang and Ma? They rushed in to fight the fire. Uncle Zhang? Ma? -Lang! -Lang! Lang! Lang! Uncle Zhang, Ma... You again! Lang! Uncle Zhang and Ma cannot die in vain. And we have to avenge Xu. We must get revenge! There is only one way to revenge. Getting the gun parts to the front line. It's time. Let's begin. Today is the water-test day for our new boat. I'll bow three times first. The first bow is for Jiashu Chen who I've never met. I wouldn't be who I am today without your Flying Fish Boat. The second bow is for Xu and the drawing delivered by you. We have finally turned it into a finished product. The third bow is for my master... who hasn't formally accepted me yet. The money I owed is finally paid off. Plus the interests. With your help, Flying Fish Boat... is equipped with armor and rapid-firing gun. Covered with dragon scales... and with bullets in its mouth, the fish leaps over the dragon gate. So please call it Rising Dragon Boat. Yes, Rising Dragon. Into the water! Wow, look, Rising Dragon Boat is floating! Yes, we did it! It's floating! Wake up! Wake up! I saw it! I saw it! I saw an enemy warship! Order! Stand at attention and make no irrational moves! Don't panic. Man your posts! Open the boiler doors. Your recent drills have been good, so don't panic. Order! Make a fire and add water! We are weighing anchor already! Order! Start the engine and feed in coal! Yes, feed in coal! Open the gate! Chief engineer, the coal is of poor quality, so 6 more shovels are needed. Yes, 6 more shovels! Okay, 6 more shovels! It looks like there is going to be a war. Bring it on! Our navy ship is so powerful that... we are sure to win! Don't worry about it. Buddy, you come back so early? You look unfamiliar. Where are you from? Yulan, wake up, let's hit the road. We'll meet your dad today. Yulan, run! From south to north, I've finally got you. Give me the gun parts! Oh, so that's what you want. You should've told me earlier. How am I gonna give them to you with you keeping me here. Tell me where they are! We guard that kind of things with flesh. Do you know flesh? Meat that you can eat. Northerners like big stews, but we southerners like to mince it up and make steamed buns, or steamed dumplings. Well, they just taste great! That mouthful of hot broth, you will never forget it. Lang! You can keep this wrench! Scumbag! Starboard got shot! Let's put out the fire! Hey, wake up, wake up! Hang in there! Hey, wake up! Sir! The flagship got shot. We need backup! Get the main gun ready! Get the main gun ready! Fire! Yes, we hit the enemy warship! Great! Shells at the prow are out. Keep firing with the broadside guns to cover the flagship. Put more sandbags around the gun shields. Get shells from the stern. Go, go, go! Sir! The vanguard of the enemy warships is passing the right flank of our fleet. With Jiyuan quitting, the right flank of our warship is unguarded. Watch out for our rear. Order! Wheel starboard five. Shoot at the bow of the enemy ship with our portside guns. Wheel starboard five! No. 3 pipe leaks badly. It catches fire again. Dangerous! It won't stay up! Don't panic. You, go replace the parts of No. 3 boiler. Yes! Faster! Chief engineer, inform the bridge, No. 3 boiler will stop running for 15 minutes. Got it. Tiehan. Mr. Guan Dai. The draft line got shot. The engine room is flooded... and the boilers will last up to another 15 minutes. The chief engineer and the men were all killed. Sir, the deck is on fire! Sir, larboard got shot and water is flooding in! Sir, starboard got shot! Sir, shells of the left front gun are out! Tiehan, the enemy warship is faster with better guns, directly threatening our navy flagship. Despite lack of ammo, Hongyuan can still crash into their flank with the bow attack angles. All right, I'll go to the engine room and wait for your order. Order! Crash into the enemy warship at full steam! Tiehan, you are a mechanic, and I'm a marine. Today, you protect Hongyuan and fight the enemy bravely. I'm honored to fight with you in battle. How could this be? Dad? Help, help! Help! -Help! -Sir, take my hands! Watch his legs. Help! Take it easy, sir. Have you seen Master Tiehan Chen? He was in the engine room before the battle, and I haven't met him since. We met an enemy attack. I saw him with Mr. Guan Dai. Steamed Bun, where are you going? This... this is Mr. Guan Dai's hat. Mr. Guan Dai... Hongyuan! That's the engine room! Be careful! Master? Master? Master! Master, wake up, wake up! I'm here. Wake up! No, we have to get out of here. Lang, here! Dad! Wake up, wake up! Tiehan Chen! Chen! Master Chen! We are here to help you! Dad！ Master... Master seems to have died. Master, you are still alive? But you almost strangled me. You jinx! You are also here. Master, let's go. Dad, check out our Rising Dragon Boat. Get on board! But we haven't rescued Mr. Guan Dai. But he... Mr. Guan Dai has... Get out of here! Go! I won't leave without you! Leave with Yulan! -Dad! -I'll help you! Boy, don't panic! Pilot Rising Dragon Boat away! Take cover! Watch out! Watch out! Steamed Bun, take me there! -I can't hold the helm! -Hang on there! Pipeline leakage! Power output dropping! He's coming after us. Come on! I'll sail around Hongyuan first. The marine, mechanic and trainee are all there. That's for my daughter, and that's for my apprentice. That's for our Rising Dragon Boat! You've actually built the rapid-firing gun. He is shooting at my dad. Lang, hurry! Come on, Lang, come on! The power is back! Turn around full rudder to rescue your dad! Hard to starboard! All ahead, full! Aim at the left of the enemy and force him to head to Hongyuan. So you've come back to seek your doom? Well, that's my double bluff strategy. What? There's another rapid-firing gun? Bastard! I have bullets for you, too! We did it! Dad, we are back! Master, master! I'm here. Huh? Master, you got shot. It's okay. Rising Dragon Boat and the guns are both great. It's just the flue outlet is too small. It's really not a good time to for you to lecture me. The mast is going to break. Let's get out of here! Wait, there's one more thing. You haven't formally acknowledged me as your master. Come on. Master! Dad! You are indeed a better mechanic than me. You finally have an apprentice. My brother would be happy. He is still haunting. Try the rapid-firing gun we built. We are out. Three mechanics, huh? You are out! Then try the steel tubes of the Manufacturing Bureau. Be careful. Lang! It's... I forget to tell you I'm a mechanic growing up on a cargo ship. I'm afraid I can't make it back. So I'll just stay here and talk with Mr. Guan Dai. I won't allow it! Lang, don't disappoint us. No, you'll go back with us! The dark clouds will eventually dissipate, and the burning water will calm down. Master, I'll keep this day in mind. It's March 26. Let's get a front row spot. Morning, Master Lang. Morning. Morning, Master Lang. -Morning. -Master Lang. We've been waiting for this day for a long time. That's right. Our first big black fish is launching. Stop fussing. From now on, we'll have many more firsts. Today's achievement did not come easily. You overcame all kinds of difficulties, lines. and the honor belongs to you ordnance workers who fight on the front... I now declare the launching ceremony begins! Release the baffles! What a beautiful submarine! The first one we built. Submarine gliding! Into the water! Lang, you've been looking forward to it for a long time, haven't you? Yes, since I was still a kid. Lang, look up!
