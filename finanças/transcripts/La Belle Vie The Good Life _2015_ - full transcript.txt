[music] [Background sound of Airline Stewardess giving instructions] Rachelle: Although I wasn't born and raised in Haiti there's been a spiritual umbilical cord that has always connected me to my homeland and despite my identity issues as a kid and even as an adult, Haiti and its culture is so much a part of me but in order to really understand who I am and what Haiti is all about I needed a search within and the pieces of my puzzle laid beneath the root. The family roots. I was born in Harlem in 1975 raised with my brother David in a small two-bedroom apartment adjacent to a community that at the time was plaqued with drugs and disinvestment. On the left side was black Harlem and on the right side of us was Columbia University. It was instilled to me that we were from the Haitian elite family but yet we never lived that lifestyle. I've often wondered where was my "bougie rights?" I drank kool-aid. Watched "The Jeffersons" and I was in love with hip hop music. While my mom always talked about my grandparents living a "La Belle Vie" (the beautiful life) She spoke of having maids and chauffeurs. Going to the beach all the time and spent a large portion of her formative years in French boarding schools. We were told almost daily of our rich legacy of the Haitian bourgeois society and we all lived vicariously through the tales of the beautiful family stories of" La Belle Vie of Haiti." At the age of nine, my mother use to make cookies on the street and sell it to people so she can buy some notebook and borrow books to study and three Nuns became very very interested about this little girl. How smart she was and everything so they took her and decided to give her an education. Born in Les Cayes located in the southwestern part of Haiti Grandma grew up in a town mostly known as a major port for the country. Isolated from the exciting world of Port-Au-Prince Haiti's capital, Grandma's parents grew up modestly. Resia Cresap: She wasn't poor but she wasn't wealthy. She had to make it she become self-sufficient and that was one of the reasons she again she left home because she felt that she could do better she wanted better. Rachelle: In Haiti there was a rigid class system that was unspoken The rich were few the poor was massive and the middle class was invisable. But my Grandma went against the social norm. My maternal Grandfather, Raoul Berne was a charming wealthy business owner. The Berne family were very popular in Haiti in the 1950s and mainly intermarried with other big-name families in Haiti or with other Frenchmen but love intercepted the rules in Grandpa's social club when he met Grandma. Patricia Berne: She was in a restaurant with her friends and when she met my father who automatically like "boom" that was like a deja vu. They fell in love and I was born like the baby love. Rachelle: Mom would always romanticize about Grandma's Cinderella life and I loved it! Grandma made it! and growing up in the cruddy streets of Harlem I adored hearing about the good life of Haiti. At a time when the civil rights era was just getting underway in America, my Grandparents were living in life. They traveled all over Europe without a care in the world they had parties and rubbed elbows with top dignitaries that were visiting Haiti. [Foreign] Lily Charlot: We had a life that you can really call “La Belle Vie” with Raoul Berne, Milone Berne. Simone Jermaine was always with us, The De Vendegis, Marie Thérèse and her husband. We created a group that was truly living the beautiful life [La Belle Vie]. Each week, actually twice a week, we would have receptions at alternate homes. So one day it would be at The Berne’s and another day it would be at the Roy’s. [End of Foreign] Raymond Cajuste: People at the time felt very, very close to one another. Practically no crime you know we're talking about a place where you could actually leave your doors wide open people would never come into your doors you can leave your cars open people never break into your cars This is the way Haiti was at the time. [Foreign] Edouard Salnave: So if you had 50 cents in your pocket and you had a date with your girlfriend you would go by foot to Bi’Centnaire. Cars were not an option to go on dates to go on dates with your girlfriend to Bi’Centnaire, but they had what was called “ The Bourgeois”. The Bourgeois were the ones who really had the movement of money. It was not much. [Foreign] Dr. Jean-Robert Cherry: In Haiti, when they call you ”bourgeois” it’s either because you have money or you are a Mulatto. And that is why they say in the Haitian community a black man with money is a mulatto and a light skin man without money is black. [End Foreign] Rachelle: I certainly didn’t understand how a country could pride itself as being the symbol of freedom by being the first black Republic to free itself from colonialism but yet there have been such self-hatred among people based on skin tone in class. [Foreign] Dr. Jean- Robert Cherry: Haiti is a country that was founded on racism. It was founded on the basis of excluding a group of people that have come from Africa. [end foreign] Raymond Cajuste: When Haiti became independent after the war . . . the slave revolt the light-skinned people what you call the “affranchi, the light skin . . . they were educated. They were actually the son and daughters of the slave masters. These people will be educated They went to France to be educated. They had money! They took over. They took over the control of the country and actually supplanted the master who was there so therefore you almost had a continuation of slavery in Haiti but different slave masters. You had light skinned Haitians who actually became the new masters. Rachelle : President Sylvain Salnave was a 13 President of Haiti from 1867 to 1869 he was my third great-grandfather and was rather unique. Although he was of mixed race he showed the masses his loyalty by spending his an entire presidency fighting against the system that wanted to continue to enslave the people Salnave didn't use his European features to instill oppression rather he practiced voodoo denounced the Catholic Church and walked among the people. at that time it appeared as if two nations existed as one the blacks who were the mass they were the laborers that connected to their African traditions and the bourgeoisie who were of mixed origin who ran the economy and the education in the country. their ties were to France. The Elite families in Haiti normally sent their children to France to be educated. This French influence not only affected the way my mother viewed herself but also dictated much of the class structure in Haiti Patricia Berne: When I was a young girl I really wanted to go back to France. because that's where I was comfortable. That's where I grew up. That's the environment that my mom put me in. Rachelle: Leaving Haiti at the age of nine, Mom was disconnected from our homeland and hadn't realized until she was an adult how much of her identity issues even affected me. For the most part, Mom, thought she was French rich and lived her "La Belle Vie" blindly to the social divide of Haiti. Patricia Berne: Being being in Haiti was always a conflict for me other children used to make fun of me a lot and I was not understood by other peers, so that's why I say I don't belong. I am not white and I'm not black but they called me "Grimelle" so I'm not either or but I was treated like I was a white person. Rachelle: Grandma tried her best to give her kids what she didn't have and protect them from Haiti's political turmoil. [foreign] Edouard Salnave: It was an era that was dangerous Even for the most loyal “Duvalierist! ” It was dangerous even for the ones closest to Duvalier. A person never knew where they stood. It was an era, where it may have been easy for you or it could have been an era where you could have been put underground! [end foreign] Rachelle: Francois Duvalier, "Papa Doc" declared himself president for life from 1957 to 1971. If he weren't for Duvalier, I probably would have been born in Haiti. He unequivocally had been responsible for changing the social dynamic of the country . He despised the elite and anyone who spoke against him. My entire paternal side of the family and more than half the population of professionals began to leave Haiti. They either feared for their lives or began to seek a better future for themselves. Mariesimone: When I came to America, I came with my nose like this but right away I saw that lady was right. I came with the wrong color. Rachelle, be realistic! We are the wrong color. aren't we? Rachelle: My family members and many others who left Haiti to come to America encountered a rude awakening. They were black and immigrants. Mariesimone: When we came here, we saw what we have lost in Haiti. I almost went back to Haiti. It was so tough. When I came here, I wasn't prepared. I use to cry almost every night! Rachelle: And here we were . . . the first generation born outside of Haiti born into the American way of life. [music] [background :"where is the money?"] [background: "I don't know" Rachelle: and this was the world wide image of Haiti. They called us "boat people" the media constantly portrayed Haiti's poverty and the CDC even listed Haiti as the origin of the hiv/aids epidemic So as a kid I didn't want anyone knowing I was Haitian and I found I wasn't alone in my identity struggle. Bernard Montperious: I'm a Haitian American born here in Queens my mother always told me I was a "Bourgeois." [foreign] which Bourgeois do you know wears a hat, and carries luggage every day that works for small tips like this? [end foreign] Even all the housekeepers working here call me “Bourgeois, Bourgeois.” and I tell them [foreign] What kind of bourgeois is going to carry luggage everyday? What kind of Bourgeois is going to carry luggage like this every day? Watch them. They don’t want me to help them. They’re doing it all on there own. [end foreign] Excuse me sir, can I help you with your luggage? Hotel Guests: No, Thank you. [foreign] You see. They don’t want me to help them Things are serious difficult. People don’t want to give anything. You saw that, right? [end foreign] Melky Jean: It wasn't necessarily cool to be Haitian. and we were the most Haitian family you could ever find. Normal for me was wearing long skirts and going to church Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday, Friday, Saturday morning and Sunday Eventually my parents moved to a better life in East Orange New Jersey so this pastor basically came from Haiti and he wanted to impress the congregation on Sunday so he wanted a few choice words and he comes to us , the kids and asked us you know how do you say "vagabond" and we were like you "motherfucker" so he ends up doing the sermon and replacing the word "vagabond" with "motherfucker" in front of the whole church congregation. he was like [foreign] "Brothers and Sisters if you do not accept Jesus Christ y'all a bunch of motherfuckers. [end foreign] Rachelle: I remember reading Langston Hughes and a number of other Harlemites that reflected on Haiti as a blueprint for black people's liberation but growing up in the 80s, I didn't understand where the shift came from why was there a conflict between black Americans and Haitians Why didn't black Americans accept us? [Foreign] Edouard Salnave: (African-Americans) were not our friends. We were living here and it was like they were wondering when we will leave. and also, they (African- Americans) don't like you too They don't like you too because of your accent , you speak French and Then they’re asking you “how does a nigger speak French?” Rachelle off screen: But Dad, but growing up I never understood why Mom and even yourself when you had parties nothing but white people. Did you think you were a white man? [foreign] Edouard Salnave: That’s a good one! During that time, Honestly, It’s only when I went to the bathroom to look in the mirror is when I notice there were only two black men at my party. You’re exactly right with what you said. There were times where I thought, like you said, I thought I was a white man. [End foreign] Rachelle: I remember this moment like it was yesterday. my last trip to Haiti was in 1993 when a bunch of us went down for my cousin's wedding. We danced , joked and truly enjoyed "La Belle Vie" the beautiful side of Haiti. Jean Bertrand Aristide was the first-ever democratically elected president in the country. There'd been a US embargo on Haiti as a result of the political unrest but I was 17 and oblivious to the effects of embargo had on my beautiful paradise. In my limited knowledge, at the time, the embargo meant that there was a shortage of fuel for us to cruise the country so we chilled at the beach. Our parents, who were concerned for our safety and the family members, such as mine who didn't even attend the wedding staying behind back in the States said [foreign] ah "forget about Haiti. Haiti is broken." [end foreign] Forget about Haiti. It's finished. Despite the warnings and our parents fears, it was at that moment I was so proud to be Haitian. Rachelle: After my 1993 trip to Haiti, I began a journey to learn as much as I could about my Haitian heritage and hence a movement within me was born. I began to meet all these Haitian Americans just like myself doing everything in their power to promote positive images of the Haitian culture. I found people in my generation that would determine to see Haiti and its image change in their lifetime. Wyclef Jean: The hardest thing for you to do is to try to stop a movement. It is totally impossible for you to stop the wave of the new generation. [horn blowing] Mecca aka Grimo: If you’re something and you’re deny your culture, something is wrong there. Alright? Whatever it is that you are? Where ever it is that you’re from, You need to be proud of where you’re from. If you feel the connection. . . even if you don't speak perfectly I don't speak perfectly I'm gonna tell you straight up I don't speak perfectly. You might think I'm the greatest ambassador But I make an effort I wasn't born in Haiti but Haiti was born in me. [music] Little Girl: "Finally!" [crowd screams] Mecca aka Grimo: So when I say "first independent black nation" I want you to twirl your fingers in the air like this and say "In the world" [crowd of kids] "in the world" "first independent black nation" [crowd of kids ] "in the world" "first independent black nation" [crowd of kids ] "in the world" [foreign] "Sak Passe" [How are you doing?] [crowd of kids] "nap boule" [We are okay!] "nap leve" [We are rising!] "Sak Passe" [How are you doing?] [crowd of kids] "nap leve" [We are rising!] Rachelle: Even though I celebrated being Haitian and I enjoyed my culture, it wasn't enough, the pride wasn't enough. Years went by since my 1993 trip to Haiti. "Haiti is getting worse!" "It's dangerous!" "The Drugs!" "Kidnapping!" The fear still kept me away. But the reality is that many of my family members that tried to hang on in Haiti eventually, moved out. With its political and economic instability, year after year you heard families departing Haiti leaving folks like us with no one to visit. Many of us have also been comfortable in our own lives to even think about visiting Haiti was like a distant dream [footsteps, rumbling] [music] [footsteps, rumbling] [music] [footsteps, rumbling] [News Reporter]: "The horrible earthquake, which has struck in Haiti within 24 hours ago our correspondents are fanned out throughout the city of Port Au Prince throughout this day bringing you the latest information…" Rachelle: When the earthquake struck Haiti, instantaneously all my identity issues crumbled in the rubble. Nothing else mattered to me. Haitians around the world became one. We all became one voice and all I could focus on was how I was gonna contribute in helping Haiti in my own way. Rachelle off screen: When was the last time you've been back to Haiti? Roosevelt Ducelus: 2007 Rachelle off screen: What are your thoughts about going back? Roosevelt Ducelus: Not too long ago I was right there in the Cathedral now you see these things collapse you see them actually look . . . you know, those are historical landmarks and and you are unable to do anything. So that is the hardest part. So that's why as soon as I can get on the plane to go to Haiti, I'll be there. Les Nubians: People went back to Haiti. People traveled. People went on the soil. Some people didn't go to Haiti for 15 years 20 years or whatever. They came back, on the floor to work. [Music] Carl Juste: When we were coming down into the airport right We're about to land. You could see the airport shit shambles. It's not like I never seen it before so I'm there any frames "boo boo boo boo boom" I just landed there. we're not way to our hotel and there are bodies in front of the hotel of the injured some dead, some alive, some hanging by some grace of God and I fell asleep to the lullaby of screams lullabies of mothers saying goodbye to their children. That's how as I fell asleep. It was hard. It was hard. Rachelle: It took 34 seconds for this horrific disaster to strike I couldn't help but to think was this the end The end of decades of fear division and the beginning of us redefining our "LaBelle Vie" [the beautiful life] At that point all I heard from the collective of friends family and folks on the social media say "I'm going back home." The solidarity was infectious so one year later after the earthquake and 18 years since my last trip I went back home. My team and I went home. [music] Rachelle: I was so excited to meet and connect with family members that I've never met before and eagerly waiting for them to tell me more about Haiti. I must admit. I really didn't know what to expect. I mean, come on! This was a country that just experienced one of the worst natural disasters in history and immediately went right into the national elections selecting the new president of the country but through it all I was on a quest to capture the changing face of Haiti. [screaming] Shala: "I love you Martelly!" Man off screen: Yes, Shala Shala: That's very good. Very good! [foreign] [singing] Black Alex: I like Sweet Mickey (president Martelly). He’s the one I want here. It's him, I will walk with. They call me Black Alex! Black Alex is here. I’m always singing for the people. Rachelle: If there’s any moment to be proud to be a Haitian It's today! May 14th, 2011 you know again, the spirit of Salnave is here! You know just the legacy… It’s just an amazing moment. [foreign] Shala: Right now we need young people to rebuild Haiti. I also pray, you see I’m a guy from the streets. They say we’re hood rats but that’s not true. We pray that Martelly brings in a good government to bring a real good change for Haiti so he does not make the people that fought for him on the streets, like Cite Soeil, like the people who fought in Grand Ville that this was all in vain. [end foreign] Rachelle: My aunt introduced me to Shala and his friend Joelle. Shala and Joelle kids who grew up on the streets at the tender age of six, in Champs Mars which is located in Port-Au-Prince the capital of Haiti. Shala could easily turn to criminal activity- but he didn't. He escaped death by his massive efforts to galvanize his community to vote for what he believed in his heart would bring him and his country real change. Rachelle: You know, everyone is in a good spirit because they're having a new President and its just a beautiful feeling. Rachelle: President Martelly had never been a politician before. In fact, he was one of my favorite Kompa singer's name "Sweet Micky" and he had a terrible bad-boy reputation with the elders but many of us in the Diaspora felt like his patriotism youthfulness and his great ideas could possibly make a difference. We all knew it would be a group effort so this is where it begins. Our crossroad. A kid from Harlem and a kid from port-au-prince both here at the National Palace doors on a road to finding a new Haiti [music] Rachelle: I guess there was a bit of guilty pleasure on one hand I was enjoying a historical performance and also filled with joy to see people at all levels celebrate this new turning point for our country but this ceremony was a clear snapshot of how divided Haiti continues to remain based off of race and class [music] Tomorrow Shala, Joelle and thousands of others will wake up in their tents trying and figure out their next meal and this small group will awaken to their comfortable lives so yes I did ponder, could this fascinating singer actually give Haiti a fighting chance. [music] Patrice Salnave: Haiti is always the 1st country to do something extraordinary. Okay! We are the first country that liberated slavery fought for slavery and now, we have a singer President. Only in Haiti. Man in background: Only in Haiti. Isn't that La Belle Vie. Yeah. You can put it as "La Belle Vie." [foreign] Shala: This is Joel's house. This is where Joel sleeps. Joel: This is where he lives. This is where I sleep. I live here with a friend of mine. Who does not have anywhere to sleep. so he stays with me. This is where I cook my food. This is the piece of wood that my friend was going to use to make his own house but he does not have the means to do it. This is where live. [end foreign] Rachelle: There was a lot to learn about my country even though I had my fantasy about this beautiful life and tried to only capture this other side of Haiti there was a grim reality staring right at my soul [foreign] [singing] [end foreign] Rachelle off screen: Wow! Rachelle off screen: What is that about? Jean Baptiste Remaris: Misery and Slavery. Rachelle off screen: and what's the message? Jean Baptiste Remaris: the message is that some people who are thinking that they are great people but only by pretension. and this song calls them up to be, umm. . . how can I say that? to live in humility I don't know- humble. To be humble. Alright Rachelle: With more than half the population illiterate education is at the top of my cousin's Jean's agenda. For a number of years, Jean has been part of the young political leadership fighting the change the educational system in Haiti his vision is to have one national educational program that all public schools will follow but the fight is a tough one. [foreign] Jean Baptiste Remaris: There is a problem with language in the education system. If Haitians can’t communication among themselves, one can’t understand the other. It’s because you have creole, a language that 100% of the population speaks. Then you have the French language, being used to instruct in the classrooms, which is a problem because the students have no idea what the teachers are talking about. The teachers do not have the training that will give the students a new education that really models what the country needs. [end foreign] Rachelle: Much of the education in Haiti is privatized with only 10 percent of the schools run by the government, 75 percent of that is unregulated by the Educational Ministry the 10 percent of these public schools are run in extremely poor conditions with only a few teachers having any formal teacher training now top that with an already poor health and infrastructure system [foreign] Jean Baptiste Remaris: If we’re really talking about a country open for business, it’s time for the government to assist in helping Haitians within the country first (or primarily) before foreigners start coming in because it’s true, foreigners will bring in money but they will also divide us more. So the vision I have for education reform is very big which is first to create a formal education. Send all the kids to school to learn from the same book with the same language. [end foreign] Rachelle: As I continue my quest to learn more about Haiti who made a difference, I didn't have to look far family members I was meeting for the first time gave me the inside account. Johanne Landrin: that's why today I'm very upset because I only have like three schools that I can put my children in Haiti three schools for the whole Port-Au-Prince who want a good education for their children. Is that right no that's wrong that's wrong I should be able to have a wide choice you know and this is what we're going towards you know you're to me it's like going nowhere and if we love our country the way we say not because of Carnival not because of when they have you can go to the beach and you have a boat and you're riding your jet ski. It's all fun but does it stop there? No! You need to think about future. Do you want your children to grow in a society where they are alone or do they want to feel that Haitian like anybody else. Rachelle: As much as I love the energy in the streets of Port-Au-Prince nothing prepared me for this level of poverty. Although poverty was nothing new to me being exposed to it in New York but Port-Au-Prince was on another level. For the past 20 years, people all over the country have been migrating to the city creating a terrible population problem. The street named after my grandfather was no longer the same Even going out on the coast of this once amazingly beautiful city just felt uneasy to me. I couldn't help the thought of the many knowledgeable Haitians that live abroad that are capable of handling the laundry list of problems that exist here and this Forgotten land. Carl Juste: The Diaspora in this bouillon were making right now. The Diaspora is the meat of this bouillon okay it may not be it may not be the soup but it's a main ingredient. Rachelle: According to the Haitian diaspora Federation, there are more than 2.5 million Haitians living outside of Haiti with its largest population living in the United States the Diaspora has been a significant economic support to friends and families in Haiti. It is estimated that the Haitian diaspora contributes well over 1.8 billion annually but as the older generation of diaspora contributors will soon end, where does that leave the younger generation in Haiti? Steve Azor: It's why have you been in America and why haven't you been back to Haiti so long you know you want to change you want to just send money and it's like someone's trying to help you but they don't want to touch they're gonna stay away from and then you know just like throw the food towards you. Rachelle Off Screen: What would you like to tell the people back in the States people like our generation about Haiti sort of the misconceptions you know how our parents think Haiti is and even the outside world? Steve Azor: first of all they're our parents and hate this but how many of us really listen to our parents anyway? I mean we don't dress the way they want us to dress. We don't really do anything that they want us to do. So I think I mean I'm such a rebel if my parents didn't want me to go to Haiti then I would have probably been down here a lot sooner Steve Azor and his brother Hurby have been living in Haiti for the past five years. Rachelle: Hurby who is known to many as "Hurby Love Bug," was one of the pioneers of hip hop music. What inspired me the most about this story is that while many people of their stature could've easily stayed in the States and continue their legacy they decided to bring their skill sets back to Haiti and make a real impact. Hurby Azor: If I had to say something to everybody for my generation down because there's older people then me I would tell them to let their kids live let their kids come to Haiti most of the people in the state don't want their kids coming they talk bad but most I mean we know that the news kills Haiti. Haitians kill Haiti! You don't have a Haitian saying "oh yeah you should go to Haiti. It's fly! Yeah, it's great! No, they don't. In America they don't tell you to go to Haiti. They say "oh my God. Why would you want to go there for? They're kidnapping people" that's what they tell you. If I Haitian is telling you that why would you want to go there. We gotta stop that. To change Haiti - only Haitians can change Haiti. Dr. Charlene Desir: My generation people that are my age they know they are in Massachusetts. Our parents were told not to speak to us in French or Creole so I have a group of my friends that cannot say a word of Creole or a word of French and most of them understand so that's one issue so that identity begins to break down in terms of stripping us from the connection to Haiti but the language sustains us and connects us to Haiti ground the ground of Haiti so there was a stripping so one of the the problems is not only separation from Haiti they separated themselves from the Haitian community except for food you know and like you know food leaves your body you know so I'm seeing that separation happens slowly and some of them you know are creating this different type of eliteness reproducing this class structure and forgetting that there's a majority that still needs assistance [Music] [foreign] Jean Robert Cherry: The Palestinian diaspora is something that is valued but for you, if you were born abroad, they don’t recognize you. [Rachelle off screen] Jean Robert Cherry: They don’t recognize your nationality. They don’t recognize you in this land even though your mother and father were born here. They don’t recognize you. Even in their constitution. It is not a small race, no. This is the first time this is happening in our story. Rachelle off screen: What are your thoughts about it? Dr. Jean-Robert Cherry: What do I think about that? I believe it’s something that hurts us. When you get older your mother and your father send you abroad to a different life. Ok? But we are not responsible for that. Then they tell you, you’re not Haitian if you don’t live here. You have absolutely no rights. [end foreign] Rachelle: Eighteen years since my last visit and after years of coming to terms with my Haitian identity, I arrived in Haiti only to be labeled as a "Dyaspora" or a "blan" I despised the term "Jaspowa" because I felt like it was another classification another added layer that the society was creating to identify me and 2.5 million others as outsiders. [foreign] Rachelle: What do you think people in Diaspora can do for Haiti? Do you think Haitians living abroad are important for the changes of Haiti? Haitian man: Yes, very important. We need those people in Haiti. Haitian man 2: The president is not doing anything for us. Yes, we want the Dyaspora (Haitian Diaspora) to come back to Haiti. We need change, you understand? Hunger is killing us. We can’t find work, we can’t do anything. Kids can’t go to school. It’s true. Even though the president says he can help, he can’t do it all. He can’t help us all. [Rachelle off screen:] Excuse me, why is it when I come here… I’m Haitian, my parents are Haitians… but you look at me and say I am “blan” (white)? Haitian man 2: Because of your language, because of your heart. If I have, I will share and you will help me because where you were raised everyone works hand and hand and like to share. Haitian woman: when you go back home you don’t have a problem. Haitian man 2: when you go back home you don’t have a problem. Rachelle: wow, if you talk to me like that were I’m from… I have a huge problem with this. You’re calling me blan (white)? Haitian man: No you are Haitian. Rachelle : No. When I come here, I guess because I don’t speak Creole that good, my style of clothes may be different… Do you understand? everyone says “oh look at the blan (white)” Me? I’m white? Me? Haitian woman 2: It’s not your color. Haitian man 3: It’s not your color, it’s your country. Haitian man 2: Your and your mom could’ve of been born here but some point your parents took you to the states. As soon as you come from another country, you’re “blan” to us. Man in background: The same as a Dyaspora (Haitian Diaspora)? Haitian man: Yes, it’s the same for the Dyaspora (Haitian Diaspora) Rachelle: I don’t like that. Haitian Man: You may not like it but we like it Haitian man 2: Excuse me, Excuse me, now we know that your origin . . . we now know your origin is Haitian. [end foreign] Carl Juste: Last time you were in Haiti you were called "blan" but you understand where they're coming from they're the ones getting chopped its their blood is going down down the street they're the ones that are protesting and being shot at. They're the ones going hungry I might be strange to you but I come in peace I'm your friend you know I want that "La Belle Vie" (the beautiful life) just like you do. I get you. So, let's get past this. Rachelle: The reality of it all was I had to get past categorizations no matter what they labeled me they couldn't take away what was in my heart and regardless of the stigmas Haiti needs the Diaspora and I need Haiti! Laurent Lamothe: Without the Djaspowa (Diaspora), Haiti will not be developed. Without the contribution of the Diaspora. so we need the Diaspora to understand the value that not they have first of all and to understand that this is the only piece of land that belongs to the Haitian. We fought for this land we got the land now we need to we have okay we have 200 years of misgovernment we leave that behind and then we look forward and positively and I remember John F Kennedy said that "don't ask what your country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country" that's what I'm telling the Diaspora right now Don't ask what the country is gonna do for you Haitians in the Diaspora. Ask what can you do nurse, doctor, cab driver barber shop owner, student, filmmaker what are you going to do for the country? [busy Port Au Prince Streets, car horns blowing, people moving quickly, car engines] Rachelle: It was still on a major quest to find this movement of change I so dreamed about. Staying in the capital day after day slowly became discouraging It was time for me to get the hell out of Port-Au-Prince I had to remind myself that port-au-prince is not Haiti so I invited Shala along with us and we headed out of the city. [music] Rachelle: It feels good to get out of the city. Rachelle (off screen): When we arrived to Saut D’eau, all the tension I felt in Port Au Prince quickly disappeared. Saut D’eau is a beautiful, spiritual waterfall know to keeping traditional ceremonies indigenous to Haiti’s culture. As kids we were told to stay away from voodoo. Voodoo was taboo in our house. so going to Saut D’eau I had no idea what to expect. but what I did encounter was this unexplainable force It was an unknown but a very familiar connecting of the past that reintroduced me to the innocence and the potential that this country has. It felt good being there next to Shala. To see him smile and to think that maybe in that moment the he too may have felt the same spiritual force only God knows what awaits Shala back in the street life of Port-Au-Prince. A life that could only survive with hope and faith and only God knows what awaits me as I continue my search for finding my "La Belle Vie" (beautiful life). [music] Rachelle: And this is the side of Haiti that is never shown Haiti has the ability to attract great tourism but tourism alone will not solve its problems it's the people who I met along my journey these beautiful stories of people all over Haiti making a real impact in their community [music] Paula Hyppolite: My life in Haiti, is a walking film because every day I wake up Each scene, each conversation is a story All my life, I struggled with identity mainly and in part of the images that were portrayed on TV now these students have an opportunity to make a real difference. Paula Hyppolite: The words that are used in Kreyol come from the heart as we love to say in Haiti [foreign] it comes from my essence. [end foreign] it comes from my essence. so if every word comes from within who better to put these words in images than us. It was like one after another stories of other people moving back to Haiti are people already living here who were contributing to make a real difference. Rachelle: It was so inspiring to me to see this amazingly beautiful side of the story that not many people believe it was really happening and it was. Ten years ago Dr. Charlene Desire and her husband Blondell opened up a cultural arts community center in the province of San Rafael. Every summer volunteers from all walks of life come to the center conducting artistic workshops for the students. Although the center's open to all genders, young Haitian girls really gravitate towards the program. Dr. Charlene Desir: There’s been a lot of rapes. Virginity is really something that is so important to certain families. So I think they try to keep the girls inside and a lot of the girls have a lot of home responsibilities that boys don’t have. in this community we have an equal number boys in high school but there's also challenges. Some times of the girls have to go and help the Mom in the market all that other stuff so they miss days of school and some of them can't even afford the minimum cost to go to a public school. Rachelle: I couldn't wait to go back home to tell people about my experience but was I naive in thinking that Haiti was really changing for the better or was I onto something? because I could not deny the reality that was in front me. These amazing projects that I witness could actually make an impact in my beautiful country [singing | foreign] Jean Remaris Baptiste: I love you Rachelle but you must understand that love is not always pleasurable. You see, I love you Rachelle but you must understand that love is not always pleasurable. Love, my sweetheart, is like a sickness. It can make you suffer or it can kill you. But when you’re in love Rachelle you have to sacrifice because some days it’s ugly . . . and some days it is beautiful and when it’s beautiful, it’s like paradise. You are always happy! All your problems go away. You forget all the terrible moments as though there was nothing but that’s how you discover all the handsome men in love but that’s how you discover all the handsome men in love. [End singing | End foreign] Patrice Salnave: That's where the cross use to be. The cross that dominated Port Au Prince Patrice Salnave: okay., now listen even the catholic church didn't do anything about that Patrice Salnave: Why? Patrice Salnave: You see that little game here? Why can't they build a little stadium Rachelle Salnave (off screen) : but they are Patrice Salnave: This is not a stadium Patrice Salnave: This is not a little Stadium. Patrice Salnave: Why do the people have to live like that? Patrice Salnave: this one talking about you know ? Patrice Salnave : No one is thinking about the country. [foreign] Patrice Salnave: I don't know if you understand me Rachelle? [end foreign] Patrice Salnave : Everything is so individual Patrice Salnave: It's not going to have an impact Rachelle Salnave (off screen): So what do you think about the Diaspora People like us There are so many of us That want to come back in Rachelle Salnave (off screen): but we have this negative perception that Haiti is a fucked-up country you know our parents put that in my head you know my father what I don't understand about my father is that he loves his Haitian culture but he won't come back to back to Haiti Patrice Salnave : What is he going to come to do in Haiti? Patrice Salnave: If this guy has a heart-attack, he will probably die Patrice Salnave: you know, with no hospital to take care of him Patrice Salnave: and those guys are in an out of Hospitals? Patrice Salnave : right ? Patrice Salnave : No? Paula Hypolitte: La Belle Vie (the beautiful life) to me is an illusion. La Belle Vie (the beautiful life), if it exists in Haiti, it's only for a few Johanne Landrin: The structure of the society hasn’t changed. . . yet and will not change if it's not done the right way. through the roots of the problem. Rachelle Salnave (off screen): What is the root of the problem? because for me the root of the problem is classification division, identity [foreign] people who are Bourgeois the people who are poor the people who are "Blan" (foreigners) the people of the Diaspora the people who are this or that? [end foreign] Rachelle Salnave (con't): When is that going to end. do you know what I mean? Johanne Landrin : What can you do as individuals to change the way it is now because obviously it's not right you have to have involvement of the people at every level of the political life or the entertainment life and make them feel that the all part of one society the Haitian society. [music] [end music] [foreign] Rachelle Salnave: Is this a home where you can stay permanently Joel: No, it is only for one year. Joel: After the year they don’t want anything to do with you. But it is really better here because Champ Mars is not good at all There is more security here. Here, when the waterfalls, we don’t get wet and my baby can sleep tranquil but Champs Mars is not good at all. Martelly partnered with some organizations with the help of the Canadian government, which is how we are here. For me - this is good. Rachelle: Okay. . .after a year, if you find a job would you prefer to stay here? Joel: Yes . . .yes, this a nice place. We like the house very much. Shala: But if there are no jobs, Joel will be obligated to leave this house. Joel: I will be forced to leave and put on the streets if I don’t have a job to pay rent. Now I have a baby, we can not live on the streets anymore. Rachelle: Shala and Joel were relocated out of those tents and it warmed my heart to know that Joel and his family were safe but with no job in sight and no education, Shala, Joel and the rest of his community have one year how to figure out how they will pay rent because if not, they're going to be put back on the streets. [foreign] Shala: In 3 days, millions of dollars has been wasted. In Champs Mars People can’t eat in the Ghetto. When Martelly’s wife and family ask for something it’s given. But for the people? Joel: Martelly has brought changes in building roads and construction but investment in human beings; to this day there is no real change. And that’s the most important, investment in people. [end foreign] [music [fireworks] Rachelle: damn foolishness is all I could say to myself I really could not understand how I really could not understand how President Martelly could have a carnival twice in a matter of five months while people were still living in tents. I wonder if the money on this second carnival could have been used more effectively. Shala and Joel needed jobs. Although many years ago Haiti always celebrated this special three-day celebration called "fete de Fleur," an event that's celebrated the beautiful flowers of Haiti I didn't see white flower in sight. [music and live horns ] all I saw was a sea of young black men who needed education and jobs. [music and live horns ] My cousin Dimitri who actually makes most of the artwork for the trucks in the carnival explained to me the Haiti does need these kinds of events because it really will help galvanize the Diaspora to come home and hopefully bring more tourism which in turn will bring more jobs to the people. [music] [foreign] Guy in the background: Hello Madame Patricia: Can I have some coffee please? [music] [end foreign] Rachelle : After 25 years I convinced my Mom to come back to Haiti with me hoping that she would see what I see that she can experience to the changing face of Haiti that we all dreamed about. Stricken with terminal cancer she sat quietly reflecting on her own life and her next journey Mom said that she would never come back to Haiti that is just truly not the same to her that this is not the Haiti she knew but she said that my truth is my truth and I should continue to tell the story of my "La belle Vie" (beautiful life) It's at that point that I realized that "La Belle Vie" truly exists in each of us. It's our own interpretation! It's the world that we choose to live in the reality that we choose to accept. For me "La Belle Vie" personifies our motto [foreign] With Unity Makes Strength [end foreign] With Unity Makes Strength [music] Mr. Baptiste, Mr. Baptiste "Haiti Lives." Marc Baptiste: Haiti Lives. That's where we are at baby." Guy with Headphones: I am just excited to be with my people Haiti Lives! DJ Sound Street - Haiti Lives! Tony Touch: It's Tony Touch. Haiti Lives [foreign] This is Voodoo Ray. I'd like to let y'all know, Haiti always lives! Haiti always lives man! [singing] Oh la la. We have to come back. [Credits rolling over music]
