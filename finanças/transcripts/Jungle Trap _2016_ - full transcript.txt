(ominous music) (helicopter whirling) (grunting) (automatic gun firing) (exploding) (dramatic music) - [Chris] I don't see why I can't lead the expedition. Remember Bena, I was in charge of the last one. - [Josh] And if you recall, you managed to screw it up royally. - [Chris] Oh shut up. - [Bena] Please let's keep this discussion civilized. Chris, let me put it this way, you're a journalist. - And a damn good one. - [Bena] True, but you're no anthropologist. - Which I happen to be. - Josh, my darling. - Chris, my sweetheart. - Sitting on your duff, in this pristine environment of the university, giving little lectures on- - Careful. - Sorry, sorry, well researched, little lectures on whatever does not make you an expert on a tribe of headhunters. Just remember the Malis, yes, the Malis. Chop, boil and shrink, headhunters. - [Josh] Come on Chris, give me a break, will ya? - And you lost two of our people in your last expedition. - That was an accident, Bena, and you know it. - The point is you didn't know how to deal with a tribe living in the deepest Amazon, the Mali. That's why Josh, the experienced anthropologist, has to lead the expedition. - Moi. - They're at it again. Arguing about the expedition. - Why, why do we have to go back to that hell hole? - One of our friends died there. - Jean, wasn't it? In fact, is that her there? - Yeah, that's her, jerk. - She was killed. - Shit Janice, don't regurgitate that stupid story again. It was an accident, you know that. - Jean was dumb enough to take a stroll. - Yeah, a Sunday afternoon stroll through the jungle. (speaker voice muffled) Get away from me. Here, go get your trade papers. See whether they have a starring role for you. - Don't make fun of me, Mark. I am going to be an actress. Or I'm going to be a movie star. - Yeah right. - I've said it before and I'm gonna say it again, Jean was killed. - Jean was bit by poisonous snake. By the time we took her to the hospital-- - It was see ya later. - She was never taken to the hospital. - She was, I was with her, remember? - So what really did happen then? - No one was killed. It was an accident, I told you that. Hey Janice, why don't you shut up? - My decision has been made, Josh will be in charge. - I can't see why we can't forget about this expedition. Getting hold of the Mali idol is a lost cause. - But we've got to get the idol if we want to keep our grant. Without that grant-- - The museum goes poof and we all lose our jobs, remember that. - Greed makes you go after Mali's most sacred possession. And greed is the reason the Mali's are almost extinct. It just happened the Malis owned an area. - [Chris] The sacred burial ground-- - That the government intended to turn into a resort. - Chris, you seem to conveniently forget that the Malis were offered another reserve. - Which they refused rightfully. - Come on, Chris, don't be so melodramatic. It's simply a case of the Malis being foolish enough to do what you said, stand up for their own rights. - And then the government troops moved in, killed the Malis, killed their women and children, burned down their homes. It was a crime against humanity. - As far as I'm concerned, I'm sorry the resort never got off the ground. I think it would've been a fabulous millionaires playground. What was the name of the hotel? - Palace of something or other. - Palace Hotel and it is now nothing but a pile of rubbish. - Another investment gone south. (phone ringing) - Yes? Please, send him in. I've hired a guide, Rick Martel, he comes highly recommended. He knows the jungle like the back of his hand. Glad to see you. - Nice to meet you, ma'am. - Let me introduce you to Dr. Carpenter. - Nice to meet you, Doc. - Nice to meet you. - And Chris Carpenter. - Pleasure. - Hi, how do you do? - If you folks will excuse me, I do have some work to do. I'll see y'all a little later, nice meeting you. - Take care, Doc. - Please have a seat. - Thank you. Ma'am, you asked me to find a route that will get us to the Malis, well, it's almost impossible. Once the bastards are in the jungle, bingo, they're gone. - Bena, what he's trying to say is, Malis do not take kindly to strangers. (ominous music) - Betsy, wait for me. What's wrong? - Nothing. Stop it. (laughing) You're out of your mind. - Have you ever been inside my mind? - No. - You know what you would find if you walk in there? You'd find little pictures of Betsy just walking across my mind's eye. Alright, alright, what's wrong? - Everything is so unfair. The deal I get, you're still married to Chris. - Separated, separated, separated, my darling. - As far as I'm concerned, there is no difference. - Betsy, Betsy, Betsy. - I understand there's some animosity between you and Josh. - Yes but Bena, my objections are purely professional. - Yes. - Let me ask you-- - I'd like to discuss your point of view but I have to run. Anyway, I'll see you later this evening. Rick, I hope you'll join us. We're having a little fundraiser at the museum. - Sure will. - See you tonight. (tense music) - I don't know why I have to go to this damn party. (siren wailing) - That's him, let's get him. (cars colliding) (gun shooting) (shouting) (glass breaking) - Remember the attack upon the Malis. You were one of the mercenaries. You will never lead them to our scared idol. (exploding) (upbeat rock music) - I just don't think we should live together, not right now. But I have arranged to bring you on the expedition. - Big deal, I was on the last one. - Don't say that, we can spend a lot of time together. - If the headhunters don't get us. - This is true. - Mark, may I have a word with you? I would like to talk to Dr. Carpenter privately. - Really, you do? - Leave us alone, please. - Don't you give me any orders. You've thrown your weight around here for the longest time. - Really? - It's time someone else took charge. - Look Chris, I really am sorry about botching up your project. - Stealing is a much better word for what you are doing. - Come on, come on, let's try to be civil with each other, alright? So how are you doing? - Fine. (laughing) Go ahead. - No, you. - I forgot what I was going to say. - Me too. - Anyway, how are you and Betsy getting along? - Fine. I tell you something, Chris, I'm really glad to see you. I sure didn't think I would be. Are you involved with anyone? - Not really-- - I just got a call from the police. Rick, he's been killed. - Oh my God. - He was speeding and his car went off the road. - Oh no, no! (evil laughing) - Slain Mali warriors. My brothers in spirit. I will avenge your death. Everyone on this expedition will be killed as sacrifice to you! They will never see their homeland again. Their souls will become your slave. (tense music) - [Announcer] Today marks the one year anniversary of a tragedy that rocked a close-knit community of researchers. Jean Mildred, 38, an anthropologist at the local museum, was part of an expedition to study the Mali, a native people who live in a remote part of the rainforest. Jean entered the jungle with a team of researchers and local guides but never returned. Search parties looked for weeks but eventually had to terminate the mission when conditions were deemed dangerous. (thunder crashing) Said one rescue worker, the jungle is hostile, but that's nothing compared to the Mali people. The Mali are known for their mistrust and violence toward outsiders. With the destruction of the jungle threatening their way of life, the Mali have been retaliating violently against everyone they encounter. Reports of beheadings and raids on research camps have been confirmed. Gee was a bright-eyed anthropologist with a promising future. She dedicated her life to researching native people and advocating to protect their lands. Government representatives have been unsuccessful in negotiating peace with Mali leaders and the native leaders have declared war. While Jean's body was never found, she is presumed dead. Colleagues and fellow researchers are still shocked and heartbroken over the news. - Jean, I never meant it to happen. It wasn't my fault you had to die. Jean? Jean, it wasn't my fault, it wasn't my fault! (paper tearing) (phone ringing) Hello? Hello? (ominous music) - Chris. I'm sorry I scared you. - It's alright. - But the kitchen door was open and I just walked in. I'm sorry. - Janice, I said, it's alright. - I have to talk to you. - Go ahead. - Is there anyway to convince Bena to cancel the expedition? - You know as well as I do Bena is all set to get the Mali idol. - It's just that I have this apprehension. Something is going to happen again. - You're afraid? - Of another killing. - [Chris] No one was killed. - Did you see Jean's body before it was cremated? - No. - I did. She had been beheaded. (train rolling) (chickens clucking) - What does she mean to you? - A lot. She's young, beautiful, exciting. Most important of all, I think she really does love me. - And you want me to agree to a divorce? - Yeah, have you considered it? - Off and on. - Good. - Where you heading, son? - Palace Hotel in El Sol. - What you doing in that godforsaken place? - Shit, I don't know. - Must be something very important you have in your mind. No one sets foot in that place anymore. - Train won't get you there, you know, they tore the tracks down years ago. - So, you really got your claws into Josh. Congratulations, you are in for a hell of a shock. - Josh is going to marry me. - That's what you think. - That's what I know. - Let me tell you, you are not his first fling. - Oh no, it's no fling between us, Josh loves me. - You don't even know what love is. - She makes me puke. Look, don't take offense, Chris, but don't you think it was just a little bit stupid to hand Josh to Betsy on a silver platter? Honey, your husband's got everything that counts. Money, prestige, social position. Oh boy, I'd give my (mumbling) for a guy like Josh. - And here I thought all you wanted was an acting career. - Oh yeah, just a pipe dream that keeps me going while I glue pots at the museum. Marriage is what I really want. - And you have your heart all set on Mark, right? - Yeah, yeah, why do I always end up with the nuts? (laughing) - You're out of luck, son. - The hotel ain't anymore, jungle's taken it over. - It was quite a place, that Palace Hotel. - It was supposed to be a millionaire's playground. - Then one day that damn hotel went out of business. - Any idea why? - Ain't no secret. - One night the Malis attacked the hotel to harvest tan-zas. The Malis had killed everyone, staff, guests. - So they had the advantage themselves. - That damn hotel they built on the sacred burial ground. (ominous music) (saw grinding) - Well, this is it. - This is the most godforsaken place I've ever seen. - You didn't expect the French Riviera, did you? - Senors, Senoras, Senoritas, I am Senor Chavez, the local chief of police. I have to trouble you to open your luggage. It is my duty to inspect all the goods brought in by foreigners. - Go ahead. - Marijuana? - No, it's wheat germ. - Marijuana. - Look, it's wheat germ. Health food, I got a weak stomach. - This machete, what do you need it for? - Going into the jungle, right? - Put it in a bag. - Rita, put this in your bag. (tense music) - A Mali tan-za. The head of their slain enemy was boiled and prepared meticulously. In time of warfare the Malis hid a tan-za in the enemy's camp. - One of them buggers said brother death was right around the corner. - Pure mythological nonsense. - No, interesting. Oh by the way, Josh, didn't you order the vehicles? Where are they? - No senora, no Jeeps. No roads to the interior anymore. The last floods washed them away. - Right, no roads, no vehicles, no nothing. Josh, why didn't you think about that disaster before we left New York. Come to think of it, why didn't you make an inquiry? Here we are in the middle of nowhere-- - Don't blame him. - I thought we could find Jeeps here and save a little money. - So go and look for guidance and Jeeps. Alright, it's your expedition. - Where in the interior do you wish to go, senor? - To the site of the old Palace Hotel. - I've heard of an airstrip being close to the hotel. Every so often our government sends in food for the natives. - Yeah, old John the bush pilot flies in on his craft every fortnight or so. - I'll get him. He usually hangs out at the El Gato bar. - Hi Janice, everything okay? - I'm fine. - No, there's something wrong, come on, tell me. - I can't tell you. All I know is we shouldn't even get close to the hotel. Even worse. - What is it? - I should've told you before. I think, no, I know, Jean was killed for some sacrificial purpose. A member of our expedition killed her. - Do you suspect anyone? - Yes. (laughing) - John the bush pilot reporting for duty. I even found us a guide, Pablo Ortega. - I knew he could find one. - Comes highly recommended. - By who? - This is your pilot speaking. We're gonna be flying at an altitude of, oh shit, we ain't even aboard. Come on, come on in, folks. Let's get aboard my Lizzy here. This ain't a 747. - You got that right. - Geronimo! Ah, good gal, Lizzy. Hey look down there, that's the rainforest. Boy, if we ever get lost down there, you'd never find us. Not ever! - I wanna go home, I'm scared! - Get in Lizzy, we gotta get these people to El Sol. Well folks, here we are. Okay, I'm gonna meet you back here at the same time in two days. And I don't want you to make me wait 'cause them Malis are restless. I don't wanna meet those bastards when they're on the warpath. - Move it. (tense music) - Look at that. I don't believe it. - Someone is taking care of the place. - Oh yummy. - Top Beverly Hills real estate. - Anybody home? - I'm sacred. - So am I. (speaking in foreign language) - I'm afraid to go inside. But I'm afraid to stay out here. - Josh, Josh, Josh. - Madame, I'm Obie DuBois, the bell captain. May I take your luggage, madame? - I thought this place was deserted. - Oh no, madame, they're all inside just waiting for you. This way please. - Anybody home? (speaking in foreign language) (doors creaking) (bell ringing) - I hope I didn't startle you. I'm Madame Trudeau, the hotel manager. You must be John Carpenter. We've been waiting for you. - [John] I must confess, I certainly didn't expect anyone living here. - Living is only relative. You are here is what matters. Obie, two suites, show our guests to the rooms. - This way, please. - Thank you. Thank you. - Merci. Jean, your friend. - Where'd you get the photo? - You should know. (kissing) (giggling) - Oh, Mark, this thing gives me the creeps. - Give it to me. (door knocking) - [Woman] Room service. - Come on in. Just about time, I am dying for a scotch on the rocks. Thank you, sweetheart. Just what the doctor ordered. What the hell? There was something in here, wasn't there? - Get out of this place. (ominous music) - Dinner is served. Dinner is served. (tense music) (laughing) - Sorry that I'm late. - Don't sit down, please, this is Jean's place. - We set a place for Jean at every meal. - Oh, in memory of her. - No, in expecting her return. (ominous music) Once the jungle covered the place where our hotel now stands. The jungle was home to the Malis. They're strong headhunters. They practice the ritual of shrinking human heads. They resisted civilization here on this spot. They made a last stand. Here they were killed, their bodies left rotting. Then the workers came and bulldozed their rotting bones under. Mixed some of them with the cement that our hotel was built with. - [Josh] The entire tribe was killed? - Oui. - How come we were told Malis have survived the massacre and came back and killed everyone in the hotel, guests, staff. - If anything like this had happened, would I be sitting here? - Where in the hell can I find a drink? A stiff one. There's gotta be a bar in this place or something like that. Oh-ho-ho-ho, oh yes. People, nice! Oh yeah, there it is. Shit. Alright, so where are they? - Mark? - Oh shit, it's you. You really gave me a scare, I thought you were a ghost. - There are ghosts, all around us. The ghosts of killed Malis and murdered guests. - Now you're really giving me the creeps. - Have you noticed that there is no staff? The place is kept up but there's no staff. - What about this guy Obie and madame what's her name? - Don't you understand, they too are ghosts. - So you mean to tell me that we are the only living beings in this joint. - Yes! We must leave right now or we will all be killed. - Hold on, we can't leave. We're not gonna be picked up until the day after tomorrow. - Most of us won't last that long. - Oh great. - When we get back to New York you want me to send the furniture over to your place? - No, it's not, maybe some, I don't know. - Dividing furniture, sorting mementos. That is the end of the line for marriage. - Mm-hmm, it takes guts to go through with it. No one wants a change. No one wants a change. - Why did we let it drag on so long? - I don't know. How about an unwillingness to get a divorce. Look Josh, our marriage was over a long time ago. And when-- (buzzy music) - What? - Look at that. - Jean, what the hell is that? - I don't know. - Very strange. (tense music) (screaming) - Listen. That's Janice. What are you going to do? - Be right back, I gotta check it out. - Don't go. - I have to go, I have to find out. - Josh, Josh, don't go. - You hold onto this. (ominous music) Janice. Janice, wake up. Ah, God! I'm telling you a murder has been committed and I have to get in touch with the police. - I wanna go home. - Are you referring Janice Hamilton? - Yes I am. - Don't bother about contacting the authorities on her behalf. I've already listed her demise. (tribal screaming) - What is that, what is that? - Mali war cries. You should know that. Doctor would've never arrived, too bad. And Mali warriors will attack, soon. - I wanna go home. - Oh shut up. - I thought the Malis never attack during daylight. - They will harvest tan-zas when the moon rises over the trees. Oh, Senor Gonzales. - We've got to get out of here! - Miss Carpenter. This came this morning. - This in the middle of the jungle? - Witness the blessing of an advanced civilization. - Janice. (screaming) Victim of the Mali warrior. - According to the Mali belief, now a slave of the warrior who beheaded her. - Don't give me any lecture, not now, please. We have to contact John. - He has to pick us up this morning, he has to. - Hey, you guys see Rita anywhere? I can't find her. Is this a bad time or what? (ominous music) - Oh come on. - Try this one. - Do something. - Damn thing worked back in New York. - Naturally. - It's on, we've got contact. This is on, we're at the Palace Hotel and we need help. - He's nuts. - There's no such place. - Come in, come in, we're at the Palace Hotel in El Sol. Please come in, it's an emergency. (screaming) - Help, let me in, please! Somebody, please, let me in! - Come in, come in damn it, come in. (static blaring) - They say there is no Palace Hotel. They don't believe we're here. - John won't pick us up. Do something, you're our guide. - So it has gotten to you too. - What do you mean by that? - Ask her. - Mind your own business. - We're stuck here for good. (ominous music) (collective screaming) - Jeez! - What happened? What is it, I can't see. - It's their message. They will harvest tan-zas. - What the hell are we gonna do? - It's all your fault, you bitch, you brought us here. - What happened? - Can't you see? - Shit. - You mean-- - That's right. This whole place was an illusion created by some supernatural force. - So we've been living in a non-existent place. - Ghosts. Josh, remember, the Malis believe the souls of their slain enemies become their slaves. - We have been so dumb. - Right. - We knew the staff, the guests, everyone was killed when the Malis attacked the hotel. - Exactly. - Wait, wait. So this guy Obie and Madame what's her name were sent here by their masters in order to lure us here. - No, she lured us here. - That's a lie. - She didn't mean that, Chris. - Yes I do. - Let's consider the facts we do know. There must be some way out of this place. Jobe, you know the natives. Jobe, Jobe! - Can't you see he has left? - Yeah, saved his own skin. - We'll all be killed. - Oh shut up. - Come on, come on, let's look at things in a more positive light. - I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die! - Hey, wait a minute, where's Rita? Rita, Rita, hey, where the hell is Rita? (tense music) Rita, Rita? Rita, oh, there you are. I've been looking all over for you. (groaning) Rita, Rita, don't hide on me. You're pissing me off. (ominous music) No, no! No! - Let me help you. - Please. Slide it right in that gap. - Mark, Mark. - Where's Rita? - They cut her head off. - Oh God. - They just cut her head off. - Oh no. - They'll do the same to us. - Here's your gun, Chris. - Okay. - I wonder how many of those bastards are out there. - We have no chance to survive. - We have no choice but to fight. - Alright, let's see. I guess the best place for a barricade is right here. Let me tell you what, I'm scared. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - [Chris] How long do you think we can hold out? - Not very long. - And then? - We'll keep (mumbling) each. All right Mark? - Yeah sure. - And I can take care of myself and Josh. You will be responsible for Betsy. - You could do that? Why not kill me now and get it over with? - Because we will kill a few Malis before we are going to kill ourselves. - Yeah, do that. (crickets chirping) (birds crowing) - Can you hear anything? - No. - The moon has been up for quite a while. Maybe they won't attack, hm? - For Betsy's sake I hope we do make it. She's so young, she has her whole life in front, she has her whole life ahead of her. She made me feel so young. - Love? (ominous music) - I guess so. - Gosh, are you sure you're not confusing sex with love? - Sometimes its hard to tell the difference. - Love is not sex, it's compassion. It's chicken soup and back rub, right? - Correction, you just wanted the security I provide. That's not love, that's dependency. - That's a lie and you know it. Let me put it on the line. You were glad to get out of this marriage. You were bored. You were bored of our life, me, you were bored. - Well why worry about it now? We'll all be dead soon. You know it's strange, how suddenly everything could be over, done. - How much longer to daybreak? - About two hours, I guess. - Maybe, just maybe, the Malis won't attack. - Yeah, hey, maybe we'll make it, huh? We're gonna make it. (guns shooting) - Oh shit. (screaming) (tense music) - I think we got most of them. - Is it over now? - No, it's just begun. Mark. The door. (door knocking) (ominous music) - Maybe they left. (shouting) - They've left. - We're still alive. (laughing) - It's daybreak, they never attack after daybreak. Josh? - Josh? (tense music) - Are you okay, are you alright? - My leg. - We have a first aid kit somewhere. - Good. - Where? - Let's find it. Somewhere over there, I think. No, stay! - Josh! - Josh! - They got me. - Everything's okay, everything's okay, Josh. - No it's not. - Hold still, we will get you to the hospital. (screaming) God, I'm thirsty. - There's nothing to drink. Have some gum. - What time is it? - About noon I guess. - John's supposed to pick us up around noon. - John's not coming. (plane engine humming) John, he is here, oh my God. It's John! - We're saved, we're saved! - We'll be alright. - Oh thank God! Where's my compact? - Oh forget about the damn compact. He's leaving, he's leaving. - He's not coming back. (whispering) They're here. - I've kept two bullets for us. - Oh no you don't. - What the hell is going on here? Looks like you've been having a little battle. I'm sorry I was late but I had a problem with Lizzy's landing gear. I had to go back. Oh my God, that poor bastard. Well, I think we better get the hell out of here before the Malis start doing their fun and games again. - Yes, let's go. You guys go on, I've got to find my compact. - No, come on, come on, Betsy. - Forget that darn thing. - It was Josh's last present to me. - Come on, Betsy! - Go on, I'll catch up! - Hurry Betsy! - Ladies, I'm leaving. - Betsy, come on! - Go on! Thank you Jobe, you kept your part of the bargain. You traded the idol for my tan-zas. - Betsy. - Jobe? Jobe, is that you, is that really you? - [Jobe] Yes, it's really me, come join me, Betsy. - I thought you had left. - [Jobe] I did leave. I went to the Mali head man, made a deal with him. The Malis won't harm you if I guide you out of the jungle. Join me, Betsy. (tense music) (screaming) - No, no, go back, please, go back! I didn't mean to kill you, I swear I didn't mean to kill you! (screaming) - Alright Betsy, you've fooled me long enough. I always knew you are a selfish gold-digging bitch but I never suspected you of murder. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Come on, you gave yourself away when you stayed behind to search for the compact. Look Betsy, no one, no one in his right mind would be concerned about a compact in the situation we are in. So I knew that somehow you had gotten hold of the idol and you, you had killed for it. - You're insane, I didn't kill anyone. - Come on, how could you kill our friend? - Gun, that's enough, hands up, hands up! So you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you. Yes, I do have the idol and I'll bring it back to the museum, not you. I'm tired of wasting my time running your errands. So I got together with Mark. I maneuvered the victims into a situation where he could kill them. Jean was my first victim. Rita I managed to lead to Jobe. Unfortunately Mark got cold feet, I had to take care of him. I delivered the heads to Jobe and you'll be my last victim. No, no! - This yours? We have no right to it. - We are revenged. - Jobe, why all this horrible death? - The Mali honor demands its enemies tan-zas. - And how about me? - You are free to go. The time of revenge has passed. We are at peace. - You want a drink? - No, no, no thanks. - Go ahead. - No, no, no. Let's go, let's go, let's go to the plane. It's over there, come on. - [John] Hey listen, we beat those bastards. I'll drink to that. - They might be coming back. - Go ahead. - No, no, no. You better not have another one. - [John] Oh hey, I need it, I need all I can get. - No, no, let's go, let's go. God, I'm glad to see you. Even though your Lizzy is no 747. - Hey, she can go any place. Old Lizzy can go anywhere. - Let's go. (laughing) (tense music)
