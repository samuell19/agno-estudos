Is our lady boss on the train? Our lady boss. No. Which cabin are you in? The last one. There's no one else in the cabin. Do you remember this person? I don't. Do you mean I did something to her? No. I didn't see him. The train is coming... carrying us away... Bao... Where are you going? I'm going to the town. Town? I don't want to go now. "If you want to have a bath," I'll stand watch for you. The lady boss of Yamato House is dead. Dead? She fell from the train. Great. I knew... God will definitely bring you good fortune... God? Didn't you really leave this place? I've been sleeping on the bed. What? Very pretty. Very pretty. A lot of noise outside. It'll probably last over the night. You're tired. Have a bath. No one is there today. Okay. I... "Come on, let clean up the main tub." I've been waiting for today for a long time. Okay. Let's go. I've some words for you. Words? We've a lot of time later. Please listen to me. In fact... I should have told you before coming here. But I just couldn't gather my courage. I don't want to listen to this. I couldn't hide this anymore. I want to hear nothing. Nothing! Kayo! I don't want to know what you did before. I just want to know the one after you arrive here in Nishikiya Spring. You won't let me finish by all means? Yes. I know you've an unpleasant past. "After the man comes," I know you're not alone in your life. Didn't Hashimoto tell you anything? Hashimoto? Forget his name. He didn't tell me anything. I didn't ask and gave him the money. You did it because you didn't want to know. But... Listen up. No more thing of the past. I'm a very jealous man. Please don't force me to listen and torture me. Got it? Got it. You say Kouko is dead? "Right, she's dead. She's murdered." Murdered? Who did it? You're startled. Bullshit. I wanted to marry her once. "Hashimoto, I've evidence now." Evidence? You went to Dragon house for prostitute again. But Flower Slave was no longer working there when you're there. Right? I didn't go to see Slave... Kouko. Then who? Kayo. I wanted to see Kayo. Blackmail her again? I like her. I want to see her. You need to know this. "On Wednesday, 17th January," "after 2:30 pm," When the train heading for Black River passed the highest point of the bridge... Bullshit! I didn't do it. You dropped you scarf. "If you didn't," her death would be taken as an accident or suicide. Kouko Shimizu had no motive to commit suicide. I know you called her. You look great in the clothes. It's not the same as we planned. I heard Kayo and you have settled in the big hotel. This is not what we agreed. I'm not allowed to appear in front of Kayo only. What the hell do you want? When will you stop bothering her? I'm here to tell you the thing I forgot to tell you. The thing you forgot? About Kayo? I don't want to hear. You don't want. It'll be something if the police hear it. Police? That woman... She killed her husband. Liar! No one will take it seriously. Marry me! Then I'll be part of Yamato House. Okay. Let's do it this way. You're just... I just make your wish come true. Let me join you guys. Okay. I'll talk to my sister. I'll get off the next stop. It's still early. Where is my sister standing? Kayo? Where? Kouko She's the one who wanted to kill. I was almost killed by her. It's true. You just said Kayo killed her husband. I did. Is it true? Yes. You dare to testify against her. Yes. Okay. I decide to believe you. Kouko... Kouko... Kouko... Kouko... "Kouko, are you alright?" Kouko... What happened? Kouko... "Kouko, could it be..." "Kouko, answer me." "Don't leave me, Kouko..." Why don't you say a word? "Kouko, don't die." "What's wrong with you, Kouko?" Please let me go to Tokyo. Kouko didn't kill herself. It's Hashimoto coming. She got a call from Hashimoto and left. Are you going to see Hashimoto? Kouko... was killed by Hashimoto? Why did he kill her? She's murdered. You may go to Tokyo as you like. But you're not allowed to come back. "If you agree with this," you may go. Don't go. Don't go... This matter has nothing to do with you. Don't go. (Heavy snow. The train suspended) "Kayo, come back." Kayo... Kayo... "Bao," get on it quick. Kayo... Kayo... Kayo... Bao. Watch out! Kayo... Throw him away. No. Hurry up. Stop. It's dangerous. Let me go. Bao! Stand away from Kayo or you can't stay here anymore. Kayo... Don't look anymore. Forget the past. "If you can't, make yourself a dumb person." Dumb? "Right, dumb." For the rest of your life. A woman who won't speak anymore. Your body will be enough for me. "Doing as you said," won't I be like a doll? You don't agree with me? Who? It's the snow. What? Why don't you answer? Please dump me. Dump? I killed my ex-husband. Please dump me. You say it again. Does Hashimoto know it? I... am just this kind of woman. Did you think you'd escaped from me? Stay here and I'll tell no one for the rest of my life. Who the hell am I to you? A beautiful toy? An unbearably beautiful toy. What? Don't you want to run? Do you have a way to run? Stop. You'll be dead if I disclose it. Strangled to death like this. No. Come on! Masturbate! Come on! Do it. No. Masturbate! How is it? Great? Feeling shy? That's it. How's it? Cool? Right. Cool? How is it? Feeling great? Am I right? You feel great. Come over. Come over. Did the police come by? Police? No. I'm sorry for what I did a moment ago. I'll reward you. I'll reward you. What do you want? Just tell me. Tell me. Money? Kayo? Please forget what I told you. I understand now. Only one time. I'll let you hold me once. You did a great job. I'll let you play me. The matter... you need to forget it completely. "Yes, I'll forget it." Go. Kayo promised me. It's true. Go. Who? It's me. It hurts so much. Stop. Stop... stop... "Kayo, come to help me." "Kayo, hurry up." Damn it. "Hurry up, Kayo." Run away. Don't you like me? "If you do, run away now." I'm an insane woman. I... I'm dirty. "Kayo, you're very pretty." Prettier than God. Prettier than the snow. Come over. Come over here. Hold me. I dare not. "If you like me," hold me. I'm stinking. "I'm stinking, so..." Hold me. Tighter... hold me tighter. Bao... She'll stay here till sunrise. "No, I couldn't run away." "Kayo, I'll carry you on my back." Grasp it tight... Grasp it tight... Thank you. Thank you. I know how to climb over this mountain. It's impossible. It's like committing suicide. Maybe we're going to commit suicide. Two tickets. Give me two tickets. Let me put the handcuffs on you. Damn it! "Kayo, run now!" That's enough... Where are you planning to go? Heaven Kayo Hayashiba said it's her who killed Kouji Fukumi. Kazuo Atagawa - Bao also insisted that he's the murderer. Both of them were sentenced to death. Why? They wanted to go to heaven. Why did you kill your husbands continuously? Why? Can I talk freely? You can. Love. I think it's because I thirst for love. Love... Love? Love is just the flavor of sex. Right? Isn't it? "When a woman wake up," she's still dreaming. I'm just a victim. Hashimoto was sentenced to a prison of 6 years. Kazuo Atagawa was sentenced to death. Can you walk? I can. Take off the sandals. Can you get on there? I can. Please don't cover my eyes. I'll feel scared. My hair... Please... The train carrying with its full speed. I wish it could make the way to heaven. Even if it's just "a hardly heard whisper," it may save a woman unintentionally. Addicted with love alone... Lock up all the memory... In the sunset... the wild wind blow its way loud... With fortune... and also you... look like... Could love... be just a flashing moment of today? "If I could naively believe in the present," at least the wind would become silent for a while... at least the dream will go on till tomorrow... Hold me... now... hold me... Can't turn back... to search for my dream... If it goes on... Could love... be just a flashing moment of today? "If I could believe in lies," at least the fire of love would start to burn... at least the hurtful morning wouldn't come... Hold me... now... hold me... Can't turn back... to search for my dream... If it goes on... If it goes on... The present...
