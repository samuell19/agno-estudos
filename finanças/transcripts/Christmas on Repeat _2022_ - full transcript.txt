Andrea, are you okay? Yeah, I just lost a contact. That must have been tough to do, 'cause you don't wear contacts. Okay, I fell off the couch again. You really should stop sleeping at the office. Well, that would mean I would have to stop living at the office. Hey, it's five minutes until Christmas break. You'll get to spend a whole week at home with your family. - Did you get... - Gifts for your hubby and kids? Wrapped and waiting in your car. What about... Bonuses for the mailing room and cleaning crews? All taken care of. I just realized I didn't get you anything. Yes, you did, and you were generous. How generous? Very generous. Merry Christmas, Jess. Merry Christmas. Huh. Andrea, just the person I was looking for. Hi, Nick. Got a minute? - Not really. - Great, come on in. Nick, I booked this time off in August. My family's waiting for me. I'll be quick. Take a seat. First, I wanna congratulate you on the Hedgewear campaign. The client is ecstatic, and the sales on the dishes are just off the charts. They have charts for dishes. Everybody's got charts. So I spoke with Donna Lennon this afternoon. She's the, uh, chairman for the Green, Clean and Pristine Cleaning Supplies. That's Will's campaign. Very good observation, very astute. But see, he's spending Christmas in The Bahamas. And? And Layla Brown, their spokesperson, is here in Boston. She was supposed to shoot a commercial for us this afternoon, but she missed her flight and was late. And she's leaving for Italy on the evening of the 26th. So we're gonna have to move the shoot. Let me guess... to tomorrow, Christmas Day. It'll just be a couple hours, first thing in the morning. It's Christmas. Christmas morning, yeah. And it'll be super easy, super quick. Will already hired the crew, we got Paul Selmon as the director, who you already know, which is, which is great. All we need from you is just to show up on set. You know, keep Layla happy for a couple hours while she says some lines, then you get to go to your family. You know I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't important, right? Okay, I might. But it is. And what an ideal way to end your year. You know we're considering promotions. Three hours and I'm out. Three, four or five, tops. Yes, then you're out. What are you still doing here? Get outta here, enjoy your time off. What time off? - Hey. - Hey. - You headed home? - Yes. I'm just gonna stop at the store and pick up some groceries. I thought maybe we could make breakfast tomorrow. - Oh. - What? Uh, nothing. Nothing, just the thought of you making breakfast. Always an adventure. Hey, I've been improving. Uh, I don't know if making toast without setting off the smoke alarm counts as improving, but... I can see your point. How did the, uh, the Hedgewear campaign go? Great, I guess sales were off the charts. They have charts? That's what I said. So listen, uh, tomorrow I might have to... Wait, wait, wait, wait, I know this one. Go in to work. It's just... For a couple hours in the morning. - And I... - You're sorry. I know the drill, Andy. John. No, but listen, I should get some presents wrapped before the kids get home. Save a couple for me, I'll be home soon. I love you. I love you too. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Oh. Well, thank you, Andrea. Wait, how do you know my name? Well, I'm Santa. I know everyone's name. I know when they're sleeping or awake, I know if they've been bad or good, or somewhere in between. Well, thank you, Thomas. He knows my name, he knows my name. I told you I was being a good boy. I also know there's going to be a shooting star on Christmas night. There's special magic in a shooting star, but a shooting star on Christmas? Well, the magic is off the charts. I guess everyone really does have charts. Don't be afraid to make a wish, Andrea. You might get what your heart desires. If only were that easy. I don't really believe in wishes. Oh, but they believe in you. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, Timothy. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Hey, guys! - Hey, mom. - Hey, mom. Hey, hey. Ooh, look at that hat, nice. - Thanks. - I'm digging it. Hey, Matt, Ryder's mom called me, she said that you weren't gonna sleep over with the usual crew? Yeah, I wasn't really feeling it. Well, I guess you have the entire Christmas break to hang out with your friends. Mom, I'm practicing a new Tiptop dance, you should do it with me. Mother-daughter stuff gets a ton of likes. I guess I could use a little exercise in my life. Yeah, try something new. Get out of those boring work clothes. Hey, your dad and I used to dance. She ain't lying. Your dad had some pretty sweet moves. I used to break down like that. Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Look at that, check the hand. Dad, they've turned sour. Hey, hey, don't be jealous. Don't be jealous, I can teach you. As soon as I catch my breath. So tomorrow, what time are you leaving? Oh, not too early. Wait, you're not gonna be here for Christmas? Just a couple hours in the morning. Yes! I'm now 20 bucks richer. Pay up, Matt. Wait, did you have a bet whether I had to work on Christmas? - Of course not. - We had to bet whether you'd work in the morning or the afternoon. The money's in my room. Then what are we doing in the kitchen? Come on. Well, Lexi is quite the loan shark. She gets that from you. Hey, hey, hey, I love her to death, but I just adopted her. She's got your genes. So tomorrow. Look, Nick gave me no choice. Apparently the talent got stuck in Boston. It's not even my account, but I have to be a... Be a team player, I know. Just remember we could use you here on the home team too. - Sorry. - No cookies before dinner. They look good. What the heck is that? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Hey, don't get too excited, all right? You know, you kids used to wake us up at 4:30 to open presents. Yeah, sorry about that. Uh, speaking of rude awakenings, who are those boys out there with Ryder using our hoop? That's Carter and Gavin, you remember them. We were on the town league when we were in middle school. Right. Why aren't you out there playing with them? It's too early, and it's too cold, and basketball really isn't my thing anymore. Huh. Well, are Christmas pancakes still your thing? Because I still have some time before I go to work. No. Hello? The great pancake debacle of 2019. The fire department showed up. It wasn't that bad. No, it most definitely was that bad. It's a nice thought mom, but I still have nightmares about that. It took me six days to get the smell of burnt rubber out of my hair. Trust me. Maybe we just have some cereal. Merry Christmas, boys. Good morning, Mrs. B. Hey, Larry, Merry Christmas! That's one opinion. - Look out! - Oh! Sorry. Don't worry about it. Being an influencer can be a messy job. There's only one product that I rely on to keep my whites, their brightest; Glean, Cream and Stream. Cut! Really great work, Layla. Absolutely fantastic. Just one little note; The product is Green, Clean and Pristine. Green, Clean and Pristine. What did I say? Glean, cream and stream. Again. Okay, well you know what? That's actually really hard to say. Maybe they should change the name. Love that idea, but this product has been on the market for five years. So I think it's maybe a little bit late for that. Let's try one more. Remember, Green, Clean and Pristine. How's it going? Absolutely fantastic. If we were shooting a commercial for a product called glean, cream and stream, or clean, serene and steam, or clean, green and, uh... What's this called? Are we set? And action! Hi, I'm Layla Brown and I wanna tell you all about one of my favorite products; Mean, Clean... That's not right, is it? Cut! Hey, Nick. How's it going? Good, good. Again, you've been saying mean. Well, you know what? Maybe you should do it then. What's that? Nothing, just rehearsals. There's no mean, it's Green, Clean and Pristine! There, I did it. For what, Christmas with my in-laws? You know what? You're mean and green, like the Grinch. I quit. So now she gets it right. Andrea. Setting up the next shot, gotta go. Bye. Layla, wait. Who are you? I'm Andrea Bowman from the agency. Oh, so you hired that guy. Technically the agency did. Well, technically I'm not working with him. Find someone else to sell your soap. Actually it's detergent. Right, it doesn't matter. Paul, wait. Did you hire that girl? Technically, the age... She's like the nightmare before Christmas. No, it is Christmas. She's like the nightmare on Christmas. Sorry, my wife is waiting for me at home. - I've gotta go. - Well, can we just... Sorry, I'm out of here. Ma'am, this is a residential area. Do you know how fast you were driving? Apparently not fast enough. License and registration. What happened to you? Layla Brown. The influencer? You know about her? Yeah. Our daughter has a slight obsession. Ugh, I wish I had Lexi with me to advise me how to relate to her. Anyway, this smells delicious. What can I do? Well, how about you cook off some stress. Take it out on some potatoes? Yes, I think I can successfully accomplish that. How's work been for you? - Eh. - Eh? Yeah, I'm a bit behind actually. I'm home all week, if you wanna go in and catch up a couple of days. Well, it's definitely an idea, but I was kind of hoping we could spend some time together as a family. I haven't seen much of you since you took the new job. I know, this year has just flown by. Well, it's been like molasses to me. Look, you know I support your career, Andy, always have. I just, I just didn't realize you'd be working this much. That makes two of us. It's been... lonely. For me too. Sometimes when I'm in the office late at night and I know you and the kids are already sound asleep, I close my eyes and remember the first day we met. Why? Because that day we bumped into each other at the restaurant. Literally bumped into each other. Hey, I replaced that sadly wasted glass of champagne. You did, you did. Chateau Seine. Which is now one of your faves, by the way. Yeah, this is true. What's also true is when we met there was just something about you that felt like home for me, and I knew I would never feel alone ever again. That's how you get through those times, huh? Yep. John, I don't thank you enough for changing my life and for accepting Lexi so openly and lovingly. I am so grateful for all the memories we've made. I sure miss making memories with you. Me too. Taking time away from you and the kids was never what I wanted. We both agreed I needed to take the job, right? Right. We wanted to keep this house, we had to pay for the repairs after the basement flooded, and save for college, and, yeah. What is it? Oh, the rolls. Oh, geez. Oh, no. They're just extra crispy. There you go. Extra crispy, extra burnt. Are you ready? Let's dance. All right, let's do this. Teach me how to Tiptop. Tiptop's the app mom, not the dance. I knew that. Just follow my lead. Ready? March in place. Shimmy clap. And dribble. And we're driving a car. Roger rabbit. Mom! Are you okay? Ugh, yeah. I don't really use that ankle anyway. Maybe you're past your Tiptop prime. Oh, sorry. I have to take this. Nick, hi. I was just about to call you. You were? Oh, that's good. 'Cause I'd hate to think that you were not gonna tell me that our shoot completely fell apart today, putting thousands of dollars and our relationship with our client at risk. Yeah, see the thing is... Actually, Andrea, let me tell you the thing. The thing is I spent the entire day on the phone with Paul, Layla and our client and I've convinced them to give us another shot tomorrow. Tomorrow? Nick, I wasted my entire Christmas morning on this. I need to spend time with my family. And I spent my entire Christmas morning on this. I need you to be there first thing in the morning, before anyone else. I want you to babysit, make sure everyone's happy so that we get this shot. Then you can spend all the time that you want with your family. Is he still on the phone? Nick! You got it? Got it. And Merry Christmas. Yeah, very, merry. Grandma Millie. How long have you been standing there? Since about, "Here's the thing." So you heard? Your boss is frustrated with you. There's a good chance your husband may be too, and if I had to guess, you don't know how you got into this pickle. Right as always. Oh, I'm so glad to see you. Me too. Did my son not tell you that I was on my way over? No, he didn't. Come on in, the kids will be thrilled to see you. Look who's here. Well, hello. Nana, I have to show you this hilarious video, come on. Oh, I have to tell you this joke I heard. A joke? Oh, good. A video and a joke, I'm ready. You're gonna die, it is so funny. Look, she messes up her makeup as this cat comes in. This is the girl you've been telling me all about. Wait, wait, what is... All right, all right. A new drill! How'd you know? I watched you break your old one the last time I visited, remember? I didn't know the basement floor was concrete. Let's open up presents from Mom. - Great. - All right. You shouldn't have, you really shouldn't have. Uh... A sweater, yeah. I don't wear perfume. Oh, a backup mixer. Huh, it's pink. You know, this bathrobe isn't so bad. So, you know how the shoot didn't go so well today? You have to work again tomorrow? How did you know? I'm used to it, I guess. Well, I'll do it. I might reverse stress eat and then hit the real food after. Okay. All right, I'll see you in a bit then. I just wish I could do this day over again. Hmm. I'm late. Oh. Oh, sorry I'm late. I thought you didn't have to be in until later this morning. No, it'll be the first thing. Okay, well just make sure you're home on time for presents then I guess. Got it. Okay, bye. - Love you. - Bye, mom. Bye, mom. Wait, presents? Morning, boys. Good morning, Mrs B. Good morning, Larry! That's one opinion. - Look out! - Ah! Sorry. Ryder, really? One day is an accident, but two days in a row, it's beginning to look deliberate. Ah, okay. Being an influencer can be a messy job. There's only one product that I rely on to keep my whites their brightest, Glean, Cream and Stream. Cut! I'm so sorry I'm late. I overslept. Late? Yeah, right? No one wants to be here three days in a row. But I'm here, I'm on it, let's make a commercial. Right. Is something wrong? I'm just saying, sorry for being late. Sorry, everybody. Who are you? Andrea, we met yesterday. Yeah, I don't think so. Really great work, Layla. Just try to remember, the product is Green, Clean and Pristine. Green, Clean and Pristine? What'd I say? Glean, cream and stream, again. Well you know what? That's actually really hard to say. Maybe they should change the name. Let's just go again. She's like a broken record, right? You'd think she would've learned her lines after yesterday. Yeah, I guess. Are we set? And, action! Hi, I'm Layla Brown and I wanna tell you all about one of my favorite products. Mean, Clean... Wait, that's not right. Cut! Hey, Nick. How's it going? Um, not much better than yesterday. What happened yesterday? Yeah, who can remember. Well, maybe you should do it then. There's no mean. What's that? It's Green, Clean and Pristine. There, I did it. Andrea, what is going on? Okay? This sounds like Christmas with my... With your in-laws, I know. I am sorry, I should have gotten here earlier. I'll fix this. Is he still on the phone? - How did you... - Nick! Coming, sweetheart. You know what? You're mean, and green, like the Grinch. I quit. Hey, hey, everybody. Again, sorry for being late. Who are you? Andrea Bowman from the agency. So you hired this clown. Oh, come on, let's not have another repeat of yesterday now. Yesterday now? Is that some other stupid product you guys are working on? - What? No. - Well, whatever it is, find someone else to shoot your commercial for you. And for Green, Clean and Pristine. I'm done with your little soap. It's detergent. So now she gets it right. Did you hire her? She's like the nightmare before Christmas? No, it is Christmas. - She's like the nightmare... - Nightmare on Christmas? Exactly. Andrea? - Andrea, you okay? - Uh... What day is it? It's Christmas. December 25th? That's usually when Christmas happens. My wife is waiting for me at home. Are you okay? I've gotta go. What? This can't be happening. People don't relive their days. And really if they did, why this day? Why not my wedding day, or when the kids were born. Is this what a nervous breakdown feels like? Ma'am, do you know how fast you were driving? I should, but I don't know if you told me yesterday. License and registration. What day is it? You serious? Completely. It's Christmas. Why, what happened? Today. Today is what happened to me, again. You and the kids haven't orchestrated some elaborate plan, including my boss and all my coworkers, and Layla Brown, and the police, have you? Have you met us? We're not that organized. Andy, you don't look so good. Why don't you go lay down for a while? I think... I think that's a good idea. Yeah. Keep an eye on the dinner rolls. Will do. Okay. Maybe it's a dream. Of course it is. Days don't repeat themselves. It has to be a dream. And if it's a dream, that means... I can fly! Nope, not a dream. Hey, kids. Hey, did you wanna try that Tiptop dance I was telling you about? Yeah, but first. I have to take this. Hello? Andrea, were you ever gonna tell me the shoot completely fell apart today? Putting thousands of dollars and the relationship with our client at risk? I kinda already knew you'd hear about it. I spent the entire day on the phone with Paul, Layla and our client. And I've convinced everyone to give us another shot tomorrow before her flight. That sounds good, if tomorrow actually happens today. Andrea, what, what are you talking about? Honestly, I don't know. Okay, I need you on set first thing in the morning before anyone else, can you do that? I hope so, I don't really wanna do this again. Is he on the phone again? Great. Well, you know what? Just call me and let me know how everything's going. Oh, and Merry Christmas. Merrier by the day. Oh, right, hi, Millie. Well, nice to see you too, Andrea. Come on in, Lexi has a video to show you and Matt's been saving a joke. Oh, yes, ma'am. Immediately. Santa's elf is here! Ah, a new drill! How'd you know? I watched to break your old one the last time I visited. You didn't know the basement floor was concrete. Is she okay? I think she's a little tired. Let's open our presents from mom. Oh, actually I left them at work. No, you didn't. They're right here. Oh, well... You shouldn't have. I know, I really shouldn't have. Symptoms of depression. Am I depressed? No, that can't be it. Stroke. No. No, I'm fine. I got the okay from the doctor two weeks ago. Who are you talking to? Oh, me, myself and I. Oh, really, huh? - Hmm. - Hmm. It's not necessarily a bad thing. Maybe it is. Well, I have ruled out depression and a stroke. What? Nothing. - Look, look. - It's nothing. Andy, you know I'm here if you wanna talk about it, right? You wouldn't understand. All right. You done? I'll get it, again. No, I got it. I know, I'm, I'm eyeing some leftovers, it'll make a good dessert and I'll dispose of the evidence. Okay. Goodnight. I'll be there in a little. Hm-hmm. I wish I hadn't had that day to do over again. Santa! No. Not again. Ugh. Oh! Must be Christmas. - Good morning. - Sorry, no time to talk. I gotta find Santa. I have no idea. Morning, Larry! That's one opinion. Look out! - Sorry. - I'll let this one slide. Merry Christmas. Oh, Merry Christmas. Well, thank you, Timothy. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! Hey, you! Merry... Ooh, Merry Christmas. Don't try and change the subject. What did you do to me? What do you mean? I mean, I keep living this day over and over and it's not a really good day. I didn't do anything, Andrea. You made your own wish upon a star. But I... But I unwished it last night. You can't unwish a wish. There are rules to this sort of thing, you know. - Rules? - Well, of course. I mean, why would anyone warn you to be careful what you wish for if there weren't any rules? Why, you could just change your wish willy nilly. And how on earth would that work? I don't know. I don't know how any of this works. You made a wish, Andrea. What did you want? I wished... I wished I could do the day over again. I know what you said, Andrea. But what did you want? I don't know. I guess everything just seemed so messed up, I... I wanted a chance to get things right. Then there's your answer. Your wish comes true when you finally get what you really want. How do I do that? When it happens you'll know. Merry Christmas. - Hey. - Andrea, where are you? You're supposed to be at the shoot. Sorry, I had to talk to Santa. Santa? Is that some kind of joke? I wish. I didn't mean that. Are you okay? No, not until I get what I really want. Yeah, that makes two of us. Is he still on the phone? Nick. Heading your way, pumpkin. Nick, I gotta go. Same time today tomorrow? Do you know why I pulled you over? Hijacking. No? Taillight's out. No. Ah, I'm flummoxed. Maybe a ticket for 150 bucks will make you stop the next time you feel the need for speed. Maybe. Tomorrow none of this will matter. Okay to go? I have to get to sleep so I can reset this time loop. Oh, you're home early. Yeah, I have to get to sleep. Sleep? Andrea, it's 11:00 AM. Good point, I should probably take something to help me fall asleep. Can I ask you a question? Sure. You remember a couple years ago when I made pancakes? Ah, you mean when you tried to make pancakes but instead made a small house fire? Yeah, I kind of remember that. Well, tell me if I'm wrong. When we were outside, barefoot in the snow, watching the fire department inside, I thought I saw you smiling. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I was smiling. 'Cause of you trying to make something, you had no idea how to make, and no business trying to make probably, all because you knew it was my favorite. It was so perfect, so, so, you. I can work with that. There it is. Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Well, don't get too excited. I know what will make everyone excited. Excited is not a synonym for frightened. Remember the great pancake debacle of 2019? The fire department showed up. I know, but if I really think about it, what I really wanna do is make pancakes for my family. So that's what I'm gonna do. It's okay. We'll try again tomorrow. - Gleam, Cream and Between. - Cut! Andrea, what is going on? - Mom! - I'm good, it's all good. Again. Gleam, Cream and Between. Cut! What is going on? Green, Clean... Is that a T? What is going on? Oh, my God, yes, mom. Shimmy clap. How do you know this? Green, Clean... This is creepy. Ugh. Merry Christmas. So what time are you going in today? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter? It's all the same, day after day. Nothing ever changes. We get it, school's the same way. So you're not going in today? When's the last time we built a snowman? - I got the carrot! - Do it, do it, go for it. Go for it. There we go. Yay! Hi, Larry. Hi. Hey, so, uh, so what do we call him, Frosty? Lex Luthor. - Beyoncé. - Beyoncé. Um, how about Dennis? Dennis? Oh, all right. Well, uh, nice to meet you, Dennis. Don't try any funny business, buddy. We got cameras out here. You wanna join them? No, it's cold outside. I'm going inside. All righty, Dennis. Let's see. Yeah, that's a good one. Hey, is everything okay? It's fine. Are you sure? I didn't make the basketball team. When did this happen? A couple weeks ago. Well, why didn't you tell me? Grandma knew. I wanted to tell you, but you were at work. Matt, I know I'm not here all the time, but no matter where I am, whatever's going on with you or your sister, or your dad, that always comes first. Sometimes it doesn't feel that way. I'm sorry. I love you so much, and I really do care what's happening in your life. And... as far as basketball goes, if you ever wanna practice, I'll be there. I remember when we used to practice before you got that new job, I miss that. How about we pick up right where we left off now? You're on. Woo! I gotta take this. Hello? How's it going? Oh, great! We were down by six, then Matt scored a three. He's so good, I just think he gets a little nervous. Matt? Who's Matt? - My son. - Where are you? At home, we're playing basketball. You're supposed to be at the shoot. That is a true statement. And then I thought let's just see what happens if I don't go in, as an experiment. Andrea, I don't think you understand what's going on. Nice! Nick, I gotta go. I'm sure we're gonna talk again tomorrow. Just spend time with your family, they miss you that's all. Is he still on the phone? Nick! Be right there, sugar plum! Andrea, you need to... Andrea? The number you've dialed is not... Did you see his face when you dunked on him? He was like, what? You set me up with the rebound. Team effort. You think if I practice enough I can make the summer team? I do. You've always loved basketball, I'd hate to see you give it up. Yeah, me too. Thanks, Mom. It was nice to spend time together. Yeah, I know. Hey, Lex, what you watching? Just this influencer. I'm not sure she's your thing. Well, I'm up to find out if you are. Hello? It's Grandma. Grandma Millie! Oh, Lexi, give Grandma Millie some breathing room. It's all right. I live for these moments. Well, where's that grandson of mine? Oh, he's upstairs. We were playing basketball all morning. Oh, I'm so glad he's getting back out there after he didn't make the team. I just found out about that. That's why he's been extra charming lately. It's all he could talk about for a week. Grandma, I have to show you the video that just dropped, come on. It's so funny. Yay! Okay y'all, now this part is very tricky. You have to be very careful around your lip line. Hey, that's Layla Brown. You know who Layla Brown is? Actually I do. I guess my cat, Rico, decided to make an appearance. I am so sorry, you guys. Anyways, like I said, I love this stuff because it's cruelty free, paraben free, sulfate free, phthalate free, acrylic free, and free of any synthetic colors and fragrances. How does she do that? Who, Layla? She's a natural on camera. Do you wanna do that? What she does? Oh, no way, I don't wanna be in front of the camera. I wouldn't mind learning more about what goes on behind the scenes though. Mom used to take me to work with her, remember, mom? I had the best time on set with you. Of course I remember. Lex, do you wanna meet Layla Brown? Are you serious? Yeah, I was supposed to work with her today. Mom what? Why didn't you tell me? I didn't... You didn't even go in? There goes my chance. Actually, you'd be surprised how often these chances come around. Hello? Andrea, finally. Where have you been? Spending time with my family. Listen, I don't know if this is some sort of power play. No. Why, would that have worked? The set was a complete disaster without you. Let me guess, Layla couldn't remember her lines, had a blow up, walked off. Yeah, but... You convinced everyone to come back tomorrow? Well, yeah, and I... And you want me there first thing to babysit and make sure everything goes okay? - Yes. - Don't worry about it, Nick. I think I know exactly what to do. And spend time with your family. What? Cue Mother-in-law. Is he on the phone again? Nick? I had fun today. I did too. I haven't seen Matt that excited about basketball in months, and Lexi building that snowman. They reminded me of that first Christmas that we spent together before we were married, remember? Hmm. I had promised Lexi that we would build a snowman. Hm-hmm. But we didn't get any snow all winter. She was so disappointed. All she wanted was to build a snowman to welcome Santa. Right. So you found that old snow cone machine and you stayed up... I remember you stayed up all night, grinding ice. Oh, boy. I still don't think I have all the feeling in my fingers. Oh, we spent the next morning outside building the world's saddest snowman. Which she insisted was the world's greatest snowman. You know, I think it was that day I decided I wanted to be a part of this family. I'd never seen someone so in love with their kid. And so in love with you. Hey, let's just get food on the table, huh? Ah, a new drill! How'd you know? Well, I saw you break the old one the last time I visited. Well, I didn't know the basement floor was concrete. Let's open our presents from mom. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. You're not gonna like it. How do you know that? It's a bathrobe. You're right, I'm not gonna like it. If there's one thing I've learned over and over from the past day, days, doesn't matter, is that I am not paying enough attention and listening. So, I'm just gonna ask you straight up. What do you want for Christmas? Uh, Andy? Don't you think it's a bit late for that? Well, sure, today. But there's next Christmas tomorrow. Uh, so, what do you want. Andrea, you know that a Christmas gift comes from the heart. It's not the gift that matters, it's the sentiment behind the gift that shows that you know and love that person, right? And you choose the gift based on what they like. Of course. Well, I'm just afraid I'll mess things up even more. Hey, hey, how about we grab some cookies and hot chocolates? - Yes. - Yep. Yes, I'll come help. We'll leave you some. Hey. I thought I'd check in on you before I head home. What are you working on? Christmas gift list. Better late than never. Lexi, likes Tiptop and Layla Brown. Well, "likes" really isn't a strong enough word. Matt likes basketball, dislikes jellyfish. Well, now we're getting somewhere. - Grandma Millie... - Oh, maybe I should... likes red wine, wealthy bachelors, fast cars. True. Dislikes... Me? Oh, I don't dislike you. Well, that's a relief because... If I'm being honest... perhaps I dislike the way you've been overworking yourself the past year. I took the promotion for them, for all of us, so that we wouldn't have to worry about money for college, and the house, and, and everything else. And what good is the money, Andrea. If you're not here to take care of them with it? You have a beautiful family who love you so much. I'm doing my best. Are you? John. I know your intention is to show the people you love the most, that work is not your top priority, they are. So I'm not the one you need to convince. Put me down for the red wine. And save the bachelor for New Years. Andrea, what are you doing? I'm making pancakes. Pancakes? Uh, hello? The great pancake debacle of 2019, remember? The fire department showed up. Today is different. Why is that? Because I stayed up all night practicing to get it down perfectly. If you stayed up all night, why are you so chipper today? I have no idea. Uh, Andrea. - I got this. - Okay. Get the fire extinguisher ready. I heard that. Dig in. Wow, impressive! Oh, my God. Wow. That is amazing. Easy, easy son. Oh, my God. They're good. These are good, good. These are so good, Mom. They're awesome. Look at this. John, I'm gonna need to steal one of your gingerbread men. It's for a good cause. Okay. Come on, Matt, Lexi, eat up. I have big plans for us today. What kind of plans? You'll see. Larry, do you have plans for Christmas dinner? No plans. Why? Join us, there's someone I want you to meet. Me? Yes, you. See you at six? Yeah, six. Wow. We've lived next door to that man for 10 years and I've never seen him smile before. First time for everything. Mom, what are we doing here? You're here to play basketball. What? With those guys? They're not even here for me, they're just here because they feel bad. Trust me, not only are they your friends, they've been here all morning wanting to play basketball with you. - Hold this. - Okay, but why? Look out! Sorry. Totally cool. Mrs. B, can we have our ball back? I'll make you a deal Ryder. If I miss this shot, then I'll give you your ball back. If I make it, I get to play with you. All right, you're on. No way! Way! Wait, aren't you gonna play or? Oh, I have to get to work. Matt can play for me. Mattie! Mattie, finally! Where have you been? We missed you out here. Spending Christmas time. It's cold outside, you know? - Alright, okay. - Cool, man. Two v two? Being an influencer can be a messy job. - There's only one product that I rely on... - Is that who I think it is? To keep my whites extra bright, Clean, Cream and Stream. Cut! Paul, can I talk to you for a minute? Just a second, I have to explain to our spokesperson what our product is called. Let's take five, it's important. Okay. Everybody, take five. Paul, this is my daughter, Lexi. Nice to meet you. Lexi is a huge fan of Layla Brown's. Actually, she has a video that I think you're gonna find interesting. Lexi, will you pull up that video you're gonna show Grandma Millie later? How did you know about that? I have my ways. Anyways, like I said, I love this stuff because it's cruelty free, paraben free, sulfate free, phthalate free, acrylic free, and free of any synthetic colors and fragrances. How did she do that? She's been stumbling over simple lines all morning. I don't know, but I think Lexi can help us figure it out. What do you say, Lex? Mom, it's Layla Brown, I don't know what to say to her. Just be yourself. You are smart, you have an infectious personality. So just be you. - Really? - Yeah. I am so glad you're mine. Here goes. Wait, Andrea, do you have any idea how much we're paying for this shoot? I do. I also know we have absolutely no idea how to fix this. So let's just see what happens. Well, what are they... Just wait. Well, that was unexpected. What are they doing? What did you just do? Nothing, we just talked. You made her cry. Not me, you did. Not on purpose, but you did. Wait, what? Layla's whole career has just been her in her bedroom with her cat and her camera. This is her first big shoot. It's Christmas, she's all alone in an unfamiliar city, she misses her cat and you've got all these lights and cameras and people. She's overwhelmed. What should we do? Being an influencer can be a messy job. There's only one product that I rely on to keep my whites extra bright, Green, Clean and Pristine. No mess, no stress and no harsh chemicals. Try Green, Clean and Pristine, the better detergent. And cut! That's a wrap! That was a miracle. No, that was my daughter. Lexi. That was so cool. Can I get a picture with you? Yes, of course. Hey, Nick. How's it going? You know, for the first time I think we got it right. Well, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Mom. Well, it was so good to meet you, Lexi. You too. I can't wait to see how the commercial comes out. Uh, I'm thinking good, thanks to you. Before she goes. Lex, why don't you show her the Tiptop dance - you're working on? - Mom? I'll do it with you. But you don't know it. I'll follow along. I'd love to see it. Okay. - You ready? - Hm-hmm. Oh, my God, I love this one. How do you know this? I have my secrets. You're better than us. Come on, ladies. I can't believe I met Layla Brown. But when did you learn that dance? Well, technically today. Mom? No worries, I got this. I'm so sorry, officer. I guess I wasn't paying attention. See, I just brought my daughter with me to work and she solved this huge problem we were having. I guess I was just so proud of her. I couldn't wait to get her home to tell her dad about it. I have a daughter as well. Her name is Cindy, she's two. I can see the resemblance. Okay, I, I guess I can let this one slide, but just this one time. Thank you so much, officer. One sec. I just wanna thank you for working so hard for us to keep us safe on Christmas day. A little token of our appreciation. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Wow, that was pretty smooth. Well, I've had a little practice. Dad, you're not gonna believe what happened. What? Ooh. Layla Brown is our spokesperson for Green, Clean and Pristine. I thought today was a good bring your daughter to work day. She was so cool, and she told me I have flawless skin. Oh wow, the height of human achievement. Hmm. I have to go call Madison, she's gonna flip. Oh, I love her. And, wow, look at you. Someone's racking up the mom points today. First Matt, and now this? What did Matt say? Well, he said you helped him get back in the game with his friends. I think he was embarrassed after he didn't make the team. He thought they wouldn't wanna hang out with him anymore. Well, they played basketball all morning. Oh, that's wonderful. So, you wanna help me get dinner ready? Actually, I have some last second Christmas shopping to do. If I run out now then I can be back in time to help. You haven't finished buying Christmas gifts yet? It depends, how much do you want a new mixer? Oh. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Yeah, okay. And we need another place setting for dinner, I invited Larry. Larry, our neighbor? Larry, our new friend. Oh, all right. Well Grandma Millie is coming at 3:30. 3:28, I'll see you soon. Man, she's good. Nick, I totally get it. When your in-laws disrespect you, it can make the holidays really difficult. Yay or nay? Um, it's not your color. Why don't you go with the brown dress? And use the white scarf as a belt. Um, where were we? Right, so you didn't just marry your wife, you married her entire family. But you just have to set some boundaries. Let them know that they are guests in your house and they can't walk all over you. You deserve respect. But at the end of the day, reminding them that they're important to you and that their time matters will give you everything that you need in return. What do you think? It's a winner. Look, I know you're right, but they scare me. I mean, what are they gonna do when I stand up to them? The question is, Nick, what are you gonna do if you don't? No more excuses. Stand up to them, but with a big bear hug. Red dress with silver or gold shoes? Why don't you go with both? I'm giving you a raise. Is he still on the phone? Nick? I am on the phone, but I'll be right out. I'll try them on first. Well, thank you, Susan. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. It's shaping up to be. Oh, your wish is coming true then? I'd say so. My kids think I'm a hero. I think I found a gift my mother-in-law will actually like, and I'm about to win my husband back. Really? Yes, really. Why? Why do you say it like that? Oh, I'm just happy to hear that your wish is coming true, Andrea. Is there something you're not telling me? No. Oh, did I say Merry Christmas? Yes. Then no, that's everything. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh! Oh, Millie! Oh, Merry Christmas. You look so sharp, I love that on you. Thank you, the kids will be excited to see you. Yes. And later on... Hi. Hubba, hubba. Hello. How did you know? Lucky guess. Thank you. Oh, nice, yeah. Awesome! Thanks, Mom. You're welcome. This is beautiful. But what's it for? I thought you should have a professional looking briefcase if you're gonna keep spending time on set. What about dad's gift? Oh. Chateau Seine. Why don't we go into the family room and leave your parents to have a little space together, okay? Let's go. You too, Larry. No, no, over here. - Oh, sorry. - There we go. Here we go. Go, go, go, go. Larry, wrong way. This way. - Sorry. - Here we go. You'll have a key soon. That's all right, you'll figure it out. And one more thing. Oh, boy. I love this. Me too. It seems like a long time ago. Yeah, and sometimes it feels like just yesterday. I was a widow with a young daughter, I didn't know if I'd be able to find anyone to share the insanity with me. I must have been the same myself because I couldn't wait to share it with you. Marrying you was the best thing that could have happened to me. Look, Andrea. I was thinking we're in a pretty good position with my Christmas bonus financially. What do you think about us taking a few days and going somewhere warm like you've been talking about? Look, I didn't wanna do this on Christmas. I was gonna talk to you about it tomorrow, bu I don't think it can wait. Things haven't been working between us. I know we've hit a rough patch, John, but we'll get through this. - We always do. - Yeah, I know. We always did, Andrea, but... I don't know how to be married to someone who's not here. I know I haven't been here as much. No, it's not just that, Andrea, it's... even, even when you're here, you're not here. John, I love you. I love you too. I just... I don't wanna wake up resenting you, or resenting us. Don't I get a say in this? You had a say in this when you chose work over your family. I didn't choose work over my family, I chose work for my family. I think we need some space and time apart. It's what's best for us. Please, John, you're, you're my best friend. I wanna fix this. We can tell 'em tomorrow. For now let's, uh... let's go celebrate Christmas. Knock, knock. How'd it go with Larry? Well, I made him promise to call me tomorrow. And I thought maybe you could use some of this. He told you. He did. And what did you say? I said, it's gonna be hard on everyone, especially the kids. What did he say? He said it's already hard. What am I supposed to do? Promotions are in January. If I walk away now, I'll, I'll just lose everything that I've worked for. What will you lose if you don't walk away? I love John with my whole heart... and I know you do too. It might be time to let that be enough and just trust that as long as you have him and the kids, that's all you need. I'm just so close. I, I can fix this, I can convince John. I just need one more shot. So you think taking on more work is the answer. I'm sorry, Millie. I have to get to sleep. I can fix this. I just need one more do over. One more, Andrea. One more do over and you'll get everything you wished for. No. No, no, no, no, no. John, where are the kids? Matt's still in bed and Lexi went over to Madison's this morning, why? John, what day is today? Yesterday was Christmas, so December 26th. Listen, I was thinking we could tell the kids before you head back to Boston. I think we owe it to them to tell 'em together. This isn't what I wanted. This isn't my wish. Santa? Santa? I know you can hear me. Where are you? Ooh, hello, Andrea. What are you doing? Well, I'm enjoying a day off. This is a busy time of the year, you know. What gives? What gives what to whom? Don't get clever. I'm about to lose my family, that's not what I wanted. Are you sure? Am I sure? Of course I'm sure, they mean everything to me. You know, Andrea, I've been around a while and every year kids from all over the world come to me and tell me what they want for Christmas. Oh, children are marvelously straightforward. They know what they want. And whether that's a doll or a new baby brother, or a live T-Rex, they'll tell you. Grownups, well, grownups are more complex. They say they want one thing, but when it comes down to it, they choose another. I was just trying to take care of my family. This is a huge misunderstanding. Please, I just need one more day. Your wish is complete, it came true. I'm afraid I can't change it now. It's not enough. John, he's my everything. A wish isn't going to bring him back, Andrea. A wish can't do what you won't do for yourself. Now's not a good time. Oh, not a good time? Andrea, now is an amazing time. The clients saw the dailies from yesterday, they are over the moon. They wanna commission a full campaign with influencers from all walks of life. Like gardening, dancing, fitness, basically anywhere you can get dirty, which is everywhere. The best part is they want you to spearhead the campaign. We're talking a raise, a promotion. - I mean, isn't this great? - Yeah, great. We need to meet with the clients, and come up with some ideas. So could you put some visuals together tonight? 'Cause we need to meet with them first thing in the morning. Oh, and I can't even wait to tell you about what happened with my in-laws yesterday. Hello? Andrea, this is... Hello? I'll be at Jill's if you need me. Okay. John, I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize anymore, just, I'll tell the kids tonight and you can call 'em after work. And, hey, congratulations again on the promotion. So this I get to do over. It's starting to become a regular thing. You have no idea. Do you know why I pulled you over? I made an illegal turn. But do you know why I made an illegal turn? Um... Matt, he's a great kid. He has the biggest heart of anyone I know, but a bigger heart is easier to break. I mean, he needs someone there to pick him up and remind him what a great kid he is. And Lexi, who you met yesterday. She is whip smart, fearless, or at least she likes to pretend she is. She still doesn't fully trust herself. She needs somebody there to remind her that she can do anything she puts her mind to. And John, my better half, my everything. A man I love more than life itself, and I'm gonna lose all of them. I'm gonna lose everything unless I get back home. Wow, that was, that was beautiful. Although I did let you off with a warning yesterday, so I'm gonna write you a ticket. License and registration, please. Andrea, I thought you were... Have you? No. Now that you're home, though, um, your mom and I have something to tell you. - Your mom and I, uh... - Can I? Yeah. Kids, what your dad and I have to tell you is that, uh... I messed up. I messed up over and over, every basketball game, or joke, or funny video I missed. Every moment I wasn't here to cheer you on or cheer you up. Every time I paid more attention to things going on at work than to things going on in my own home, I messed up. I love you more than anything, but I guess I got so caught up in providing for you that I, I lost sight of being there for you. For all of you. Andrea... John, you have supported me since the moment we met. You have helped me chase my dreams, even when I chased them too far. And not because you had to, but because it's just who you are. And I guess I just got used to that and I took it for granted. I didn't realize that I could lose it. Andrea, I really don't think... But this Christmas I realized that my dreams are here with you. And without you I don't have any dreams, I don't have anything. Look, I don't care if we go broke. I don't care if we have to sell the house. I don't care if we have to eat ramen for every meal. I don't care if I have to trade in my car for a bike. I don't care about any of it. I will let everything else go if there's even a chance that I can hold onto you. Andrea. Don't make any decisions now, but I'm not moving out. If I have to sleep in a tent in the backyard, I will... just as long as you're there when I wake up. Please don't make any decisions that you can't take back, I've made enough of those for the both of us. Andrea, I can't have you sleeping in a tent in our backyard. Because... as long as I wake up with you beside me, I'll be forever complete. Welcome home. Welcome home. Just trust me. Hello? Hey, where are you? You on your way? I'm not coming in. Not coming? Did I not make myself clear? Nick, you've always made yourself very clear. That's one of your few good qualities. But it's time for me to make myself clear, I am not coming into the office. Okay, but the client... Specifically requested me for this campaign, right? So tell them that I am not available until after Christmas break, an extended Christmas break. What if they say no? I don't care if they say no. But, Andrea. I am not available to work with them until next month. I'm taking my family on a well deserved vacation, somewhere warm. It's been far too long since we acted like a family. Andrea, you can't do this. I just did. Andrea? I am really starting to like her. That's my girl! Bravo! That's what I'm talking about. - Did you hear that? - Merry Christmas! That was great! So, where are we going on vacation?
