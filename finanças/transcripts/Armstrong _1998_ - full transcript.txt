Wait a second. You got the passports? Yeah. What's the matter, Bob? Nothing. Just jetlag. God, look at you. You're sweating, baby. Come here. We'll go to the hotel, take a cold shower, crawl into bed and shake off all this jetlag, okay? What do you say? You got it. Passport, please? It's a long way from New York, Mr. Zorkin? What? You're an American? Of course I'm an American. Here's my passport. Well, Zorkin sounds Russian. My husband was born in New York. And his parents? His parents were born here. Is there a problem? No, just curiosity. Welcome to Russia, Mr. and Mrs. Zorkin. Thank you. What? We're being followed. I know. It's okay. It's okay. Excuse me, driver? - Yes? Is that Red Square? This is the Red Square, madam. Very famous. Not as famous as the Empire State Building. Now, that's something to see. Don't be like that, Bob. Look! I'm looking! I'm looking! What's the new building there? This is Americans. They build many buildings in Moscow now. Many buildings Americans build. What do you think, honey? Moscow. Beautiful. Yeah. Therefore, we have been presented with a great opportunity in the formation of the Russian/American Nuclear Corporation. In concluding my report, I want to make a short statement. Russia and the United States signed a crucial treaty on nuclear disarmament. Our organization is to protect this treaty... Hey! Look what you did to my shirt! Send me the cleaning bill, Tovarish. Lovely, lovely. It took you one minute and a half. I told you he was the best. I can do better. Good, good, Mr. Armstrong, good. My security forces at the Federal Bureau would love to be trained by you. Andrei tells me that you're a SEAL officer, U.S. Navy, and that you work with CIA. May I ask you a question? Okay. What brought you to Russia? That's a bit personal, Colonel. Let's just say I had a disagreement with my superior officer. I wanted to get as far away as I could, and Russia was far enough for me. So, what... what do you do now? I'm training your KGB elite forces. I think you call them the FSB now. That's how we met. The Captain was a good student. But with all your political changes, it seems your new KGB cannot afford my expertise. You see, I'm very expensive. Yeah. Mr. Armstrong, explain to me, please. What is it, your profession, you're so high-pay? Dying. You see, every time I take a job, I expect to die. For that, I deserve to be well-compensated. Okay, so... so you break into the room. What... what do you do next? Now, where was I? Well done, Mr. Armstrong. Armstrong, you're hired. I'm very expensive. You're still hired. Where are you going? I'll tell you later. Go back to sleep. Bob. Bob! Bob. Later. Bob! Can you tell me what's going on, please? Susan, if I'm not back here by midnight, I want you on the first plane out of this country. What, so you're just leaving me here? Sweetheart, of all people I don't have to worry about is you. After all, you're the only woman that ever made it through my Navy SEAL training course. Take care. Goddamn you. Bob! I love ya. I love you. Vodka. Thank you. There's our American friend. I want you to follow him. I'll make contact with our men here and get us some gear. Yes, sir? Can we help you? Taxi. Use this. Stay in touch with me, and do not lose him. Yes, sir. Ponytail, this is you? Who the hell else would it be? Where are you? Tverskaya. Do you know Tverskaya? Yeah. Robert Zorkin! What the hell you doing in Russia? Hey, hey! Good to see ya! Wait 'till you give me a drink and I'll tell ya! Come on! You got it. Vodka straight up. Yeah, that's right. Rod, I'm glad you haven't forgot what I taught ya. How could I forget Indochina? Panama. Grenada. Nicaragua. Cocked, locked, and ready to rock. Robert Zorkin, what the hell are you doing in Russia? Well, since when do I need a damn reason to visit the best damn SEAL officer I ever trained? Come on. That's not why you're here. Something serious, isn't it? Yeah. Special ops. Who sanctioned it? NIS? CIA. No. This comes from the top, Rod. The President. The President. What are the terms and conditions? All this has to do with that nuclear disarmament agreement we signed with the Russians two years ago. Yeah, I just started training some new agents from the FSB. Now, wait a minute. Those are the guys that took over for the old KGB, right? Yeah, they're all together now. These new agents are supposed to protect an organization called the Russian/American Intercorp. We got big trouble. There's been a breach. A year ago, we discovered that nuclear weapons have made their way into the Middle East and North Africa. Terrorists. You know, they're buying them like hotcakes. The Russians deny that they're involved in all this, and that they're disposing the weapons, but it's all bullshit. So I'm here to get to the bottom of it, Rod. It's a covert operation. I need your help to pull it off. I don't work for the CIA anymore. I'm freelance now. And I'm making a hell of a lot of money teaching them everything I learned from you over the years. Rod, look me in the eye. Once a SEAL, always a SEAL. I need your help. You're telling me you don't have anybody else in Russia? What happened to the huge network of spies you had all over the East during the Iron Curtain days? Come on. Everybody knows the Mafia runs this country. Look, it's been a long time. I wouldn't know where to start. I do. Come on. What is it? Somebody follow you? Listen, there's a tape, okay? What tape? Shh! Quiet! What tape? Come on! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Rod! Rod! I need a gun! Bullets! Anything! In the kitchen! Are you looking for this? Motherfucker! Look what you did! Let's go! Bob! Bob. You had to come all the way to Russia... to die like this? Police. Hello, Mrs. Zorkin. I'm Rod Armstrong. I know who you are. Would you sit down? Do you know where my husband is? Yeah. Something happened. Where is he? Will you please just sit down? Tell me what's going on. Susan... Do you mind if I call you Susan? Where is Bob? He talked about a tape. Yeah, I don't know if he hid it somewhere or took it with him when he went to see you. Wait a second. We were both laying down. We had bad jetlag, and I saw him fooling around with the VCR. Maybe, maybe it... Bingo. He brought it with him all the way from the States. Let's look at it. I gotta go. Where are you taking it? To somebody I think I can trust. Use this if you have to. Captain, take a look at this video tape. This is our main depot near Moscow. How did you get the material? Who shot this? A friend of mine brought it with him from the United States. It probably came directly from the Pentagon. The camp is completely out of bounds. I'd like to take a look at this depot, if you don't mind. No one is allowed even near it. But I bet you can get in. Nah. Even I need a permit signed by the Colonel. Zukov? Or the Minister of Defense. No. Nobody should know we're looking into this depot. Why'd did you bring me to this affair? You know I could have you arrested for this. But you won't. Let's call Colonel Zukov. No. Just you and me. I don't trust anyone else. Why do you trust me? Just a feeling I have in my gut. I seldom make a mistake when it comes to character. You have to get us both in. Pick me up at midnight. Okay. I'll be there. I better check on Susan. Midnight. Da. Da. Not one word, or you'll serve your food in hell. Get in there! Who is it? Room service! Hold on! Hold on! Just a minute. I didn't order room service. But what the hell, I'm hungry. Okay, push it in. Slowly. That's right. Right over here. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Okay, good. Good. Thank you. Now get the fuck out. Go on. Close the door. Close the door! Free dinner. Relax, lady. The view from here is absolutely wonderful. Who are you and what do you want? What do I want? What does any man want when a woman like you is in the position you're in? What a gentleman. This gentleman could take you whenever he wants to. But business before pleasure. What kind of business? Hold it! Fucking hold it and sit your ass down! Sit down! This is gonna be very easy. You give me that tape... and we'll call it a day, okay? All right, guys. It's been fun, really. But why don't you tell me what the fuck this is all about? Shut up! The questions will come from us and the answers better fucking come from you! Get over here! Sit down! Now that I have your fucking attention! Did Robert Zorkin contact any local authorities regarding his suspicions? Suspicions about what? Games are a major fucking no-no here, lady. Do you understand? So I guess tennis is out of the question? Shut up! Did Robert Zorkin contact any authorities, police, KGB, anyone? I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do, and you'll fucking tell me! All right. Did you kill my husband? I'm afraid your husband did his job a little too well, Mrs. Zorkin. He killed himself. But my question still stands! Authorities! Agencies! Phone calls! If I tell you, what happens to me? Well, I promise to kill you quick. If you're gonna kill me anyway, why should I tell you anything? Just tell me what I wanna know. Just tell me what I wanna know, and I promise you won't suffer, okay? In the bathroom. He hid something in the bathroom. Eric, in the bathroom. Wait. I better show him. Okay. Eric, she wants to show you. After you, my dear. It's in the manila envelope. In there. Go on. Goddamn! Eric! Yes, sir. What is it? Theater tickets to La Traviata. La Traviata is an opera, you idiot! Well, lookie, lookie here. What are you gonna do now? What is it, 60-80 feet down? I know what I'd do. You got a decision to make, lady. Come on. Why don't you come over this way? Just look over the edge. It's quite a ways down, isn't it? What, are you just gonna fly away? Come on down here. Come on. You got nowhere to go. Come on. Don't do it. Don't do it. Shit! Holy shit. Susan? Susan? Susan! Susan! Susan! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Hello. Don't shoot! Hold your fire! Let the bitch go. Come on! I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Damn! Okay, boss? I'm fine! Kill girl now? No! Leave her to me! There she is. Let's go! Spread out! No! Idiot! I kill her, boss. No, I kill her, okay? Okay. Don't! Thank God. Where have you been? Let's get out of here. Damn! I kill her now, boss? If I made a mistake, I'm gonna have to kill you. You know that. Or I kill you, Rod Armstrong. Let's go. This is Camp 14. I'm gonna check out the perimeter. Pick me up here in an hour. Da. What did you find out that you didn't know before? It's much worse than I thought. Now do you believe me? We must talk to the Colonel. Where do we find him? Well, you have to see it to believe it. Come on. Get in. Rraugh! Rraugh! Not bad. Yuri! Mr. Armstrong. Colonel Zukov. May I speak with my Captain? Absolutely. Mr. Armstrong, tell me, what are you really doing in Russia? I work for you, Colonel Zukov. You know something? I don't believe you. You know something? I don't believe you, either. Aaahhhh! What a night. This is Susan Zorkin. I... I'm really sorry for your loss. Thank you. Rod says you're gonna help us find the people that murdered my husband. I'll do my best, Mrs. Zorkin. He was fighting for Russia. It's a great shame there is... so much violence still here in Moscow. Looks like you could use this. Spasibo. Captain, are you sure you weren't followed? I lost him. Who? Some fat tall bastard, dressed in a Russian uniform. But not with our forces. Probably Mafia. Sounds like Yuri, the Lieutenant. You know him? Yeah. What did you find out about Camp 14? She's all right. You can trust her. You were right. Ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads have been smuggled every night from the depot by truck, right under my nose. What else? He's in on it. Who? The Colonel. Vladimir Zukov. Yes. Zukov is the highest ranking officer in the Russian nuclear division. There's only 3 people above him: The Minister of Defense, the Vice President, and the President himself. It's incredible. The Colonel. God. What am I going to do? Where am I going to go? You don't go anywhere. Zukov goes, and the Mafia goes. The Mafia goes? You're crazy! You can't fight the Russian Mafia. And why not? What do you make of these? Tickets to La Traviata. The Russian opera. Famous Bolshoi. And what's special about 'em? It opens tonight. There is something else that's special about them. Bob brought them all the way from America. Maybe he bought them at travel agency, or Russian cultural attaché. Or listen to this theory. Your President signs a disarmament agreement with the United States. Then he finds out nuclear weapons are being smuggled out of the country and sold to terrorist organizations. His international standing now is at steak. Whoever's involved is gonna blow their head off, starting with Vladimir Zukov and whoever's above him. You see, somebody wants the President out of the way... so he can't stop the largest business deal ever in Russia's history. There are only two figures above Colonel Zukov: The Minister of Defense and the Vice President. And the President himself. Don't forget him. You can't buy the President... I hope. Susan? Yeah? We're going to the opera. Well, boys? Who said Moscow doesn't have a heart for fashion? You look, fantastic, like Cinderella in the fairy tale. Merci. Just get me home safe before midnight. We'll try. So... you ready for Russian opera? Bilet. No, thank you. Who's that next to the President? It is the Vice President. And the officer next to him? It is our Chief of Staff General Petrov. But they're not in on it. If they knew, they would not sit so close to the President. Shh. Do you have a cigarette? These are cigarettes. Yes... toilet? Petrov just left. Shit! Excuse me. Excuse me. Fast! [crowd screaming. Stop! Do not move. What's going on? They made a mistake. They've arrested him. I'll get him out. First, we must get out of here. Come on. I'm gonna be at Armstrong's place. Please get him released. Don't worry, just get in. Get in. Bring him back. I will. Hello? Is someone there? Hello? Is anyone here? Surprise! What is it with you? You some kind of Peeping Tom? Pervert? Did you enjoy the opera? I just love La Traviata, don't you? And the soprano was incredible, wasn't she? What do you want? Well, what we don't want is the same scenario we had last time. You see, you're alive... and you're looking very good. You can afford to be a little more hospitable here. We can all be civilized. Just answer a couple of questions and we'll be off. We really don't want to hurt you unless... well... unless you force us to. Sit down, Susan. May I call you, Susan? Sit down. No, idiot! I'm trying to have a drink with the lady! Gimme that! Get the fuck out of here! Sorry. Take it. Please take it. Can't you see that I'm trying to be friendly? Come on and have a drink with me. You may still be my friend one day. I mean, it's a crazy world we live in, don't you think? Good. That's better. Now as the Russians say, Na Zdorovye. I want some information from you, Susan, and I'll leave you in peace. You'll agree? Okay, but I really don't know very much. Just tell me what you do know, okay? Now, I presume that you're going to, you know... tell me the truth, right? I'll do my best. Good. So let's start. Your husband left a tape in your hotel suite. Where is it? Mr. Armstrong took it. I haven's seen it since. Good. You are telling me the truth. You see, I was testing you a little bit. I know that the tape is with Mr. Armstrong. That leads me to my next question. These opera tickets that you had in that manila envelope... where did you get them? My husband brought them from the States. I don't know where he got them. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. Okay. I believe you. Good. So, we're finished. No, no, no, no, no. Just... one more question. One more. You answer it and we go, okay? Just tell me the truth. All right. Susan, why did your husband come to Moscow? For vacation? He chose Moscow. Yes, but why did he choose Moscow? It was something he always wanted to see. His parents are buried here and... and... Susan... Susan. You are a sweet girl. Now you're lying to me. Tell me what you know. Don't lie, okay? Why did Robert Zorkin come to Moscow? I told you. To spend time with me. It was supposed to be our first real vacation. Don't you try my fucking patience, bitch! Why did he come here? I just told you. It was supposed to be our first... How'd you get me outta there? I have friends in the police department. Besides, they know you're the one who saved his life, not tried to kill him. Lights are on in my apartment. Susan is up there. She said she had the key. Gimme your gun. Be careful? Watch yourself. Susan. Susan. Susan? Susan? Rod. They've kidnapped her. I know. I read English. Who's Ponytail? He's the one that killed Robert. They tailed him all the way from the United States. What is his connection to the missiles? He's a Mafia-type. American Mafia. And the other one's a Russian from New York. Great. So now we have American Mafia and Russian Mafia. Mr. Armstrong. Mr. Armstrong, I hope it's you listening there. It better be you. Now listen carefully. First, I'm sure that you wanna know your friend is still alive. And the answer is yes, she is. And we're all waiting for you in the conference room at the Russian/American Nuclear Corp that you obviously know so well by now. Here she is. Rod, don't come. They'll kill you. You listen to me, you son of a bitch. If you touch her, I'll kill you. I'm coming. Your friend is still alive, Mr. Armstrong, but not for long. So you better move your ass. So? He's on his way. Let's go. Da? Rod Armstrong. Boardroom... no gun, mister. I have no gun. Okay. Armstrong. The man said no guns. This no gun. This machine gun. That's very funny. Now what? Where's the girl? Uggghh! Where's Susan? Speak English! No speak English good. Then speak English bad. Where's the girl? Girl? No understand. Devochka! They kill me if I talk. I kill you if you don't. For the last time, where's the girl? I don't get that. The camp. Camp 14? I know the place. How do you say that "chetna chetna" shit? Chetyrnadsat! 14, okay. Good-bye. What are you gonna do with all these missiles, start another war? Nuclear weapons are a highly-prized asset these days. And given their scarcity, I'd say it's most definitely a seller's market. What's wrong with these men? They're dead. Dead. Dead as dead can be. Take her upstairs. Those were people. Human beings. Doesn't that matter to you? The only human beings that matter now... are you and I. Andrei, come in. Andrei, pick up. Pick up the damn thing. Come on! Come on! Come on! Andrei, come in! I can't wait any longer. There's no more time. Come in! Da. Rod? Is that you? I'm at Camp 14. I'm going in. Get here as soon as you can. Don't worry. We're coming, my friend. Hold on. So bring the fire brigade! You must put this fire out immediately! It's dangerous! Don't you understand? Put it out immediatly! And bring me that lunitic driver who drove the truck! What do you mean you can't find him? Find him and bring him to me, you $5 million cash. Count it if you'd like. Da. I must leave. My helicopter's waiting. No, you're not. You're not going until I say, Colonel. Who is giving orders here? Not the Russian Mafia, I hope. No, sir, the American Mafia. So no one leaves this base until I say so, you understand? Comfortable? Go to hell. You've got a ringside seat to Moscow's private Armageddon. Ground zero. You know, I would... I would just love to take you with me if I could, but... sorry. I think you know why you're here. We needed your hero friend Armstong because he knows much too much about this operation. So you're really gonna detonate a nuclear missile right here in Moscow. Straight at the Kremlin. Do you remember Chernobyl? You are insane. Enjoy the fireworks. What about you? You'll die. We'll be in Istanbul when this happens. You're never gonna get away with it. It was nice knowing you, Susan. We'r set to blow the Kremlin in exactly five minutes. 5 minutes? We must go! No. Somebody get me outta here! Aaaahhh! We're all gonna die! Can you hear me? Eric, shut her up. Dammit! Somebody get me out of here! Shut up! What are you gonna do? Shut up! Fuck off! Commense countdown. No, not yet. I said commense countdown. And I said not yet! We wait for Armstrong. No. I'll wait. Now get the fuck out of here, both of you. Da. Drop it! Drop it! I've been expecting you. You see, I knew you'd come for the girl. We've got five minutes. I do, but you don't! In a second, I'm gonna shoot you straight to hell. If you're gonna shoot, shoot, don't talk. Stop! What? You are not going with us! No! Give me the money! Go! Go! Go! Shit! Susan! You OK? Now I am. We gotta get out of here. Quick. I disarmed this missle. We're gonna be alright. Thank you. Well, I'm glad you came. So am I. Armstrong. Been looking for you everywhere. I want to thank you. I couldn't've done it without you. Da. Da. So Susan, are you going back to America? I don't know. Susan never got her vacation. I'm going to show her Moscow. Bob always wanted me to see it, so... I'll take you up on that invitation Mr. Armstrong... Andre. Moscow is very strange city. You must be careful. I will show you around city.
